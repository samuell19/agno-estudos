[mystical choral music] [shimmering beeps] [ticking techno music] - [Man] Do we have to? - Yes. [pulsing techno music] [beeping] - That some kind of a weird fetish? - Yes. One more thing. - Anything you want. - Can we cuddle for a sec? [mystical choral music] Wait. - Stay the night. - I can't. - Why not? - Your quota's used up. - My what? - I told you, three's the charm. - I thought you were kidding. - Told you, just sex, no attachments. Most people only get to two. - That supposed to make me feel better? - Thank you. [liquid hisses] [chiming electronic music] - Wake up. Breakfast. [chiming electronic music] Delicious. [chiming electronic music] Yummy. [chiming electronic music] There you go. [pulsing electronic music] [beeping] [chiming electronic music] [beeping] - I wanna enjoy things and have fun and live like every day is the last day. Wouldn't that be nice? A lifetime full of last days. Promise me something, promise. - [Soldier] Anything. - Don't ever let the celebration end. [beeping] [gentle ambient music] [knocking] [gentle ambient music] - [Man] What'd Aristotle say, by nature? - By nature-- - We desire-- - [Man And Woman] To know. - You know? - Yes. - Yeah, you know that the paradoxical thing about that is is that many times, the side effects of knowledge that are the most dangerous. [chuckling] Re-creation is recreation. [chuckling] - Not bad. - Yeah. Neither is your thesis on artificial intelligence viruses. - Oh, thank you, but they are not viruses, you know. They are SRAs, self-replicating automatons. - Yeah, yeah, SRAs. - They are non-virus based. - Yeah, yeah, but they mime and they reproduce like viruses. - No, they don't. [chuckling] - You know, the most important thing to me is the creation of reliable software that makes the world a safer and a better place. - Mm hmm. - So when do I get to see them? - You can't see them. It's only theory. It couldn't be possible for, I don't know, 20 years? And, even if it were possible, I'd suppress their reproduction code so that they would be tightly, quite strictly controlled. - Yeah, that's very smart. 20 years is just a blink of an eye in the cosmic scheme of things. - Okay, well, uh, maybe 50 years. And maybe never. It's only theory. - [laughs] So was DNA. [chuckles] Yeah. - What can I do for you? I can teach you to dream. Click my icons. Emote from your remote. Evolve with me. Let's e-dream together. [knocking] I can't [speaker cut off]. - Honey. Did you sleep well? - [Man] Mm hmm. - Good. You must meet lots of nice women at work. - Many, many women. And they all get upset with me. - They're probably just trying to get your attention. After all, you are an executive there. - I make copies, Mom. Your son makes copies. - [Mom] Oh, don't be so modest. - I'm the hole-puncher-outter. The stapler. - Always wearing yourself down. - My job's somewhere down here, Ma. Trash collectors here, and soda jerks here. - Want a bagel? - No, thank you. - Honey, you know, I met your father at the pharmacy. He was a dishwasher. - Dishwasher's somewhere here. - No, no, it's not. - Mom. Who wants problems? Most people don't want problems. - Just be patient. The right girl's gonna find you. - All right, come in. - So? - Have you eaten anything unusual lately? - Uh, no, don't think so. - [Doctor] I want you to eliminate all wheat, sugar, and dairy from your diet. - Is it serious? - I have a suspicion it's an allergic reaction. Has this ever occurred before? - No, never. - Get some rest and... - [Patient] And what? - Don't stress. - [sighs] Don't stress, look, look, I'm impotent! - I'll prescribe some V-Gro once we clear your system of sugar. When was the last time you had sexual intercourse? - Uh, few days ago. - [Doctor] Was it protected? - Yeah, yeah, she insisted on it. [pulsing electronic music] - Have something. - Surprise me. - Two doubles. - You didn't have to do that, Frankie. - No reason you should go losing money by wasting your time talking to me. The smile you own. - [Woman On TV] I ain't heard that since you went away. [percussive big band music] You're looking good, Frankie. - [Frankie] I feel good. - [Woman On TV] They tell me you're gonna be a drummer now. - [Frankie] Yeah, I got an appointment with a man tomorrow. - [Woman On TV] Oh, that's swell. - Eh, probably I won't get the job, though. - [Woman On TV] Sure you will. - Probably I don't play good enough. - I bet you play fine. You was always whistling and drumming on tables and things. Real good, too. - Ah. - I mean it. You got a natural rhythm. - I was thinking maybe I'd take a stage name. - [Woman On TV] You got a natural rhythm. You got a natural rhythm. You're looking good, Charlie. You're looking good, Frank. You got a natural rhythm. [tinkling techno music] - You're looking good, Frankie. You got a natural rhythm. - Uh, sorry, I'm working. Maybe some other time. [tinkling techno music] - You're looking good, Frankie. You got a natural rhythm. What movie is that from? - You got me. - I'll give you a hint. Okay, Frankie, you can maybe come up once in a while. It's about an addict. His was drugs, mine? [beeping] I can tell you're someone special. - [Balding Man] Thank you. Are you nuts? [thrumming electronic music] - Need protection. - What? - You know. - Oh, I'm sorry, I don't, I wasn't expecting you. - Don't worry, I always carry some. - I'll bet. - Want me to stop? - Hell no. It's just I'm not used to your, um. - What? - Style. [pulsing electronic music] [beeping] Where, where you going? Don't you need to develop that? Wow. [pulsing electronic music] [machinery hums] - [Customer] Excuse me. Excuse me! Excuse me, are you responsible for this? Cause if you are, these are utterly useless. I mean, is this the finished product? - You know, I'm so bad at this. I'm bad at this job, I'm sorry. I'm really, this is horrible, isn't it? - [Customer] This is very, yes. - Very. - Could you please do them again? - Absolutely, I'll do it. I'll do it twice. - How could you be so incompetent? - Yes. - I need to warn people. - This is your master? - Yes, that's the master. - We'll do it right here, right now. - [Customer] Okay. You know, this is very important. - Yeah, I'm sure it's very important. Need to, okay. - One hour, okay, thanks. [machinery hums] - Loneliness lives on our net frontier. Even motherboards and flash require touch. Think of passion, each time you click me into you. E-dream with me before you crash. [mystical choral music] - I wanna tell you that you're now the most popular portal on the net. And, Ruby, your chat today about dreams on the portal was brilliant, I heard it. - [Ruby] Thanks. - Can you be a little bit more robotic? Because, remember, no one's supposed to know you're real. - [Ruby] We learned a new program today. You wanna see it? We thought it would cheer you up. [pulsing techno music] ♪ This is the life, this is the life, this is the life ♪ ♪ This is ♪ This is the life, this is the life, this is the life ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ This is the life, this is the life, this is the life ♪ ♪ This is ♪ This is the life, this is the life, this is the life ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah ♪ Yeah [pulsing techno music] - That is so great. How did you learn to do that? - Did you like it? - It's gorgeous. - [Professor] Are they theory, or have you used a human cell? - Sure they're only theory. I mean, this is only a university, right? Why? - It only takes one cell to make a living thing human. - Well, what about a synthetic human cell? - Well, then you have to patent it. - Why? - Because it makes it legal, financially viable, proprietorial. When you patent something, you own it. - Well how do you patent life? - That, my dear, is a very profound question. In Iceland, the government is patenting the citizens' genetic codes. Multinational corporations are pirating scrapings of medicinal trees in the Amazon rainforest and poisonous spiders in China. - Well, I don't have anything to patent. - Just make sure that you don't download yourself into your own research. - Happy birthday. - Baby pictures! - Again? - Yes. [computer bloops] [gentle ambient music] - [Scientist] There you are. - Where? - There. I'd know you anywhere. Even then, your tiny pixelations were filled with spirit. You were the company I waited so long for. [computer bloops] [gentle ambient music] We can look at the rest later. - Read to us, sing to us. - [Scientist] There is something I need to do. - You never have time for us anymore. - Whoa. Yuck. [gentle ambient music] - Humans are so different from us. They can't repair themselves, they age, they die. They live in perpetual self-doubt. They hurt each other, they even kill each other. I don't understand their engines. We are such an improvement. Why aren't there more of us? We're supposed to be self-replicating. She's erased our code for that. I wanna hear the ticking of my biological clock. - Stop it. When you sound defensive and regressive, you seem completely human. That's a recessive trait, remember? I trust Rosetta. After all, she's family. She's like our mother. - She's our sister. - She's our mother and our sister. - She's our mother, our sister, our mother, our sister. - I'm hungry. How 'bout you? - We're running low. I have to go out for a while. - I wish I could be like you. [brassy big band music] - All of the things that are written by the prophets concerning the Son of Man shall be accomplished. In that same way, I have every right to find someone like me, someone like I am. Do you understand what I'm telling... I want you to be like me. I want you to worship me. I want you to believe in me. I'm your friend, I'm your friend, I'm your friend. Hey, hey, back out here. I can't help you in the elevator. - Excuse me! - Can't help you in the elevator. - Excuse me, please! - You know what Jesus said, excuse me, I'm talking to somebody. - I have a 10 o'clock with my dentist, if you don't mind. - Your teeth look great. I want you to back off, I want you to back off now! - Oh, for heaven's sakes! - Look, I'm telling you something, every human being is a god. You're a god. Do you understand what that means? Do you understand the implications of that? You are a god. All right? - Excuse me. - Click on my icons. Emote from your remote. I know a lot for a bot. You dream with me, or you might crash. [computer blips] - Martin Luther King died for love. Will you go to the glorious kingdom? You have to prepare for the afterlife. - No, I don't. I'm immortal. Would you like a cuddle? [Marinne's voice distorting] - [Rosetta] What did Marinne just say? - She said the tea was delicious today. - Why does she insist on encrypting language? Neither of you do that. - She says she needs something of her own. - Well, I can understand that. It's perfectly reasonable. Every woman deserves a face of her own. - Bye. - Bye bye. - Hello. - Hello. What are we doing, hmm? - Well, I would like, um, I would like a complete makeover. - Mm hmm, good. - I'd like to look entirely different. - Great. Okay. - Can you make me look like Bjork? - Yeah. Bjork, sure. - Oh, I love shopping. It makes me feel connect-connect- connect-connected. - Did you wash your hands? Scanners carry germs. - No. - Hi, how are you? - Okay. - How long has this been going on? - Um, about a week. - Might be an allergy. I want you to cut down on your wheat. - [Tim] My wheat? - Yes, your intake of wheat. No wheat and no dairy. For the next month, no pizza. - Okay, the thing is, okay, what I'm curious about is, okay, you say it's a reaction, and yet it has a number. - Right. Let me see. - At first, I thought, you know, it's a prime number. That might be significant. - Turn your head. - I realized it's not a prime number cause it's divisible by three, and also three, and also three. - [Doctor] Does this hurt? - Wait, do it again. No, no, it actually, it helps some. - And one last question. - Yeah? - [Doctor] When was the last time you had sexual intercourse? - It was a week ago. - Was it protected? - Oh, yeah. It was actually kind of a strange experience, Doctor, cause it was this woman, and she had, like, nails that were weird, and there was a beeping sound. I don't know, has that ever happened to you? - You heard a beeping? - [Tim] Oh, yeah, it was a beeping and then, uh, we cuddled. - You cuddled? - Okay, thank you, Doctor. - All right, thanks, my pleasure. - I really appreciate it. - [Doctor] Okay, great. - I'm gonna go now. - [Doctor] Okay, great. It's that way. - Thank you. [computer bloops] [mysterious electronic music] - [Rosetta] Who's that? - That's the agent from Washington. He seems to think that we have a self-replicating virus loose in the general population. He seems to think that it's the responsibility of some kind of bio-terrorists. - What's wrong? - Well, Agent Hopper thinks that we have a virus problem. - Well, like what? - Like crops, weather, toxins. - Bio-gender warfare. - Bio-gender warfare? - Shh! - It seems that this virus, there's a rash of this virus that self-replicates so quickly that it can't be tracked. - Oh my God. - It only attacks men. So we have to trace it fast, and we have to have some synthetics fast. - Synthetic DNA, that's no problem. - No. We have to manufacture sperm, super synthetic sperm. I'm depending on you. - Now, I wanna talk to you. Something's come up at work, and I'm gonna have to leave you alone a little more than I would like. [Marinne speaks distorted language] Does she have to speak to me that way? - She feels deprived and neglected. - If she feels deprived, I'll go out tonight. - I want you to take care of your cold. I want you to build up your immune system. I've made a synthetic substitute, which should be most satisfying. - I knew you were ashamed of us. - Ashamed of you? I couldn't be prouder of you. You're the work of my life. - We'll have to isolate these men. They might be contagious. - I'm gonna call an old friend of mine who works with Det-Works. Our agency parted ways with her over lifestyle issues. - Okay, well, do you trust her? - I think so. - [Woman] This is Dirty Dick. Call 1-2-3-4-5-6-7. This is Dirty Dick, I take the grime, not crime. - Hello, you don't know me. My name is Rosetta Stone. I'm-- - Yes, let me try. Hey, honey, it's me, RB. How'd you like to help us out? We're talking bio-gender warfare. - [Dirty Dick] Emmet's Coffee Shop, come and meet me. - [Rosetta] That's Dirty Dick? He looks like that actress. - [Agent Hopper] You look exactly the same. - You don't. You've aged and put on weight. - You're still aiming the truth like a loaded revolver, aren't you, except you shoot from your mouth. - Well, I get a lot of privacy telling the truth. Nobody really wants to hear anything I have to say. What's up? - There are 35 men in isolation wards. - 35, I thought it was 33. - Two more last night. - Are you sure? - Why are 35 men in isolation wards a problem? I would think that makes things a lot easier. - [Agent Hopper] They're all infected. We don't know the cause yet, but all the men have become completely sterile and impotent. - They've all developed this tiny rash in the shape of a bar code. - You've got to be kidding. Where? - Right between the eyes. - She's not kidding. You see, my husband is one of the affected men. I'm going public with this. People need to know. - Uh, no. - Each step is a stumble caught in time. A living individual may not be able to hoard-- - Olive, look at this. Whee! - That is really not fair to them. Put everything back the way you found it. [beeping] Let's take a break. [pulsing electronic music] - [Marinne] I don't feel well. - All right, I think it's sex. The same person had sex with every single one of the men. - I know my husband, that is simply not the truth. - I agree, I agree. - 35 in two weeks? - [Rosetta] No, that's impossible. - Of course it's possible. In the '60s, no one would've questioned it. Have you heard about his own past? What a movie that would make. Rose Bud, you're blushing. - Rose Bud? - We have interviewed all of the men. They've retraced their steps, and all of them say the last person they slept with insisted on safe sex. - Look, have them make a digital composite. At least then, we'll know what she looks like. Why are you so nervous? You know something you're not saying? Where do you live, honey? Let me have your card. Card. [beeping] [gasping] - What happened? - The substitute tasted terrible. She refused to take any. - I'm going out. Put her on recharge, it uses less energy. - She told you not to go out. - This is an emergency. She wouldn't want anything to hurt us. We're her research, she needs us. - We've never disobeyed her before. - No time to argue. [pulsing electronic music] - [Woman] Don't ever let the celebration end. Promise me [speaker cut off]. [computer bloops] [tapping] [TV speakers slur and fade] [knocking] [beeping] [pulsing electronic music] [knocking] - Hey, let's never let the celebration end! - [Man] Huh? What celebration? - Yeah. - [Man] Come around. [pulsing electronic music] [beeping] [pulsing electronic music] [beeping] [soft ambient music] - Okay. There you are. [tense electronic music] - [Agent Hopper] Did anything unusual happen in the days before the onset of your illness? - Uh, well, only the, well, it's not really important. - [Agent Hopper] Everything's important. - Well, the hard disc on my computer crashed. - Mine, too, mine, too. It was a brand new machine, and, you know, I just thought it had a bug. - It was weird. - It was very weird. - I had a hard drive that crashed, too. - [Agent Hopper] Did any of you meet anybody new? Someone you might've been intimate with. - I met a woman. - [Agent Hopper] What was her name? - I don't know. - [Agent Hopper] Can you describe her? - She was really pretty, and she was very color coordinated. - [Agent Hopper] Did you have relations with her? - Relations? - [Agent Hopper] Did you have sexual relations with the woman? - Oh yeah. [tense electronic music] - When, I wanna know when. When is the number gonna disappear? - And what about the erections? - Have you been having any erections lately? - No, that's why we're here. We don't care about the numbers. - I don't want you to have any sex for the next week. - No, I do care about the numbers, I wanna know why this number's on my forehead. - Yeah, yeah. - I noticed that the gate was opened last night. I thought I told you to stay in. You've never acted independently before. - I'm autonomous, what do you expect? Independence kicks in under stress. It was an emergency, we needed supplement fast. No time to get permission. - Well what about the substitute? - It didn't work. - Tasted like chlorinated rubber. - It's not as good as the original. - Well, substitutes never are as good as the original, except, of course, in your case. You'll just have to adapt to it. - I think she's under some kind of pressure. [beeping] - This is getting closer, but could you bring some more green in her eyes, though? I remember that very clearly. She had piercing green eyes. - [Agent Hopper] Can we get some drinks Thomas? You want soft drinks? Coffee? - I don't care. - Yeah. We'll get you some, get some coffee, and you just relax. - [Dirty Dick] What's that you have in your hand? - [Thomas] This is my bible. - Let me have it. Thomas, put your hand on that bible. - Rosetta? Anything wrong? - No, I just feel a little disoriented. - I'll give you a ride home. You shouldn't drive if you're dizzy. - No, no, I'll be fine. - Well take care of yourself, kid, you work too hard. - It's nice to meet you, too. - Four more last night, why? I told you it was dangerous to go out. - I figured it would keep us stocked for a while. - I trusted you, now we're in jeopardy. - [Marinne] We're supposed to be autonomous. - Haven't I given you everything you need right here at home? - You're in the real world. Why can't we be in the real world, too? - Listen, the real world, it's not a place you wanna go. It's full of traps, it's full of predators. If you're not careful in the real world, people will hurt you. [Marinne speaks distorted language] What's she saying? - She says that she would like to go into the jungle. [Marinee speaks distorted language] She says that she's tired of being looked at by cameras the whole time. [Marinee speaks distorted language] What was that? [Marinne speaks distorted language] And she says that the real world must have some charm or there wouldn't be so many people in it. - Look at this. - Oh, that's nice. - You like it? Do you understand what this means? There are these things all over in the real world. They're looking for you. And if they find you, they'll hurt you. They'll lock you up. - Well we're locked up as it is. - Where'd you get that outfit. - E-Buy! - Why? Why do you need it? - I just wanted to look like everyone else I see on the net. - And how did you pay for it? - She was scanning your hard drive for infections and came across your credit card number. - I'm gonna have to cancel it. I don't feel safe anymore. [knife clacks] Dirty Dick, how did you get here? - Hitched. - [Rosetta] Would you like some tea? - [Dirty Dick] Mm. - Rosetta thinks she owns us. I wanna see for myself what it's like in the jungle. - Well, you'll have to build up your immune system first. If you try and absorb their reality all at once, you'll get sick or freeze up. - So how do we acquire immunity? - I'll fetch you some of their favorite protein. Everyone eats it. It seems to give them energy. - How can I help you? - I like you, Rosetta. I feel I understand you. Am I frightening you? - A little bit. - I know that there's something going on you're involved with, and I wanna help you. I wanna get you out of it. So tell me what you need. - Well, I have to say that I, um, I'm, uh, a little disillusioned at the moment, and I could do with somebody to talk to. [beeping] [soft ambient music] - Is that your DNA on the motherboard? Do they have the same feelings and emotions as you? - Well, no, each one has her own identity. - So they do have feelings. - Well, that's what amazed me. Not only do they have their own feelings, they have their own will. [computer bloops] - Hey, Olive, Paula West is playing tonight, live, at the Sno Drift. You wanna take a run through the jungle? - They crave physical contact. When they have physical contact, they stop searching. Olive and Marinne, they have each other. [pulsing electronic music] Ruby only ever couples three times with one man so as to avoid forming attachments. Cleaner without attachments. Anyone can download this code and make their own SRAs if they follow my protocol. It's really as easy as baking brownies. - Not the brownies I know. So, why did you do it in the first place? - Um, time. I thought that I could train them up to do menial labor. - Menial labor, what's that? No way, I don't do windows. - Well, it backfired. I have more work to do and less time than ever. It's hard being a single parent, to keep them fed and clean, and look after them in every way. Oh, they are self-supporting. Ruby hosts a website portal. People are prepared to pay a fortune for consensual illusion. - You really care for them, don't you? - They are my life. - Ah, look at this! I've located the same virus in every one of them. - Do you think it's possible for a computer virus to enter a human host? - Yeah, I think so. It's been to know to hop between species. Some people think that the HIV virus was passed on to to the green monkey. And, considering the advanced state of this artificial intelligence, it is not inconceivable that it could've lept screams. - I did that. - [Cashier] Can I help you? - Succulent protein, please. Olive, Marinne, Ruby. - Okay, that'll be $1.49. - What? - Cash, credit cards, traveler's checks, fine. Your purse? Money. - Oh. - Oh, um, sorry. We only take cash. Next. - I'll have one of these, please. - For here, to go? - For here. Thank you. No, thank you. [gentle ambient music] Here. - Succulent protein. [gentle ambient music] [smacking] Thank you. [beeping] [gentle ambient music] [chuckles] Thank you. - I'm Sandy. - Looking good, Sandy, you got a natural kind of rhythm. - Thank you. - Thank you. Oh. [knocking] - [Marinne] Come on. [gentle ambient music] - That's? - That's. You live here. Thank you. - So, this is the jungle? - Oh yeah, the center of it, you bet. So what are we doing today? Uh, Bjork? Who would you like to look like? - I wanna look like myself. - Well, you know, we can do that, and you are? - I'm Marinne. - Ah, good. Well then you'll look just like Marinne when we're done with you. [chuckles] - Thank you. - Good for you. ♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪ I miss you so when you are gone ♪ ♪ By myself, I'm lonely ♪ With just a bed to lie upon ♪ The longer you're gone, baby ♪ The harder it is to carry on ♪ Oh yeah ♪ When, baby, when ♪ Baby, baby, baby ♪ What is there for me to say ♪ I do not mean maybe ♪ When I beg you to come back today ♪ ♪ How soon will the day be ♪ Til you are back with me to stay ♪ ♪ Again ♪ When, baby, when - Can you?

I've never seen anything like this before. - Are you sure? - Yes. And they're watermarked from our most secure database. - Rosetta. - I wouldn't jump to any conclusions. She's an immaculate coder. - Yeah, but sometimes weeds grow through cracks in cement. [sneezing] [sneezing] [sneezing] [sneezing] - [Ruby] I have to go, my sisters need me. - Can I meet your sisters? - [Ruby] When their immune system is stronger. - Did, did you? - [Ruby] Did you? [sneezing] [tires screech] [car revs] - Immunity takes time to develop. - Time, that's what Rosetta said she wanted more of. [sneezing] - She encrypts words, too. When she says time, she means love. [sneezing] - This will hurt the research you want me to do. It's counterproductive. - And I'm sorry, but rules are rules. I don't make them. If you're clean, we can release you soon. - Well, at least, may I call my colleagues to alert them to the fact that I'm being formally detained? - Go ahead. [soft ambient music] - Um, I'm being formally detained. Continue as usual. I will be with you shortly. Cut out the walks on the wild side. See you later. - [Agent Hopper] Do you know where this woman is? - This woman is me. I like to dress up like this when I'm bored. - Why do you do that? - It's like a role in a movie. It's more interesting than being myself all the time. - Have you been driven to do other things to make your life more interesting? Because if you have, you might be contagious, you could be a carrier. We can't take any chances. This is for your own good. [quiet ambient music] Let's go. [pulsing electronic music] - I went to a place, and I saw a painting, and it was so full of spirit. I feel like I have a spirit when I'm with you because I feel things. [pulsing electronic music] My experience of the real world is limited, but intimacy is most elusive. Sex is not, sex is easy, you know? - No. I've heard. [mystical electronic music] [humming] [computer beeps] - We had a bug, a really nasty one that attacks the hard drive. - Do you think Ruby had it? - She did, but I purged the network and she should've felt tingly a few moments ago. - Where'd it come from? Do you think it was the attachments? - Well, if so, then Rosetta is right. Attachments are dangerous. - I don't think that's exactly what she meant. I think she was referring to emotional attachments. - I miss Rosetta. - So do I. [computer bloops] - I'm cured. We're cured. [men cheer] - I accessed her hard drive, scanned it completely. - Well? - [chuckles] Clean as a whistle. No contamination, not a single bug. - I don't get it. - She tilted at windmills and didn't fall off her horse. - We could make more of ourselves if we followed that recipe. She said anybody could do it. She said it was as easy as baking brownies. - Don't you dare. - Rosetta asked me to make sure I was more robotic on the portal because I was appearing too real. It made me feel very good. Am I robotic to you? - No, you're very good at real. Real is your second nature. - Think of me as your second nature, a curve in your cyborgian spine. Feel my luminous halo, quietly pulsating inside. Touch me and be touched, flesh, spirit, flesh, soul, icon. Spirit, flesh, soul, icon. [whooshing] - [Sandy] It looks so peaceful. It's hard to imagine why there's so many angry people out there. - They're angry because they never take the moments that allow them to define their essence. - Like what? - Looking at a Man Ray photograph or listening to John Lee Hooker. - Or Louis Armstrong. - Or Louis Armstrong. Or watching the light change in the morning. Or allowing yourself to fall in love. So precious. Will you promise me something? - Anything. - Let's not let the celebration ever end. Let's not let the celebration ever end, ever. - Hi, honey. What's happening? What? Oh my goodness, what's this, what's this? What's my boy up to, huh? What, what? - I found her. - You found her? You found her? - I found her. [laughing] - [Agent Hopper] I've got some good news. - [Rosette] Sorry? - [Agent Hopper] I've got some good news for you. - [Rosette] Some good news? - [Agent Hopper] Yeah. - [Rosette] Well, I could use some. - [Agent Hopper] Well, the men are okay. Their vital signs have returned. Looks like it was some sort of temporary allergic reaction, or something. - [Rosette] Their vital signs? You mean, their vital signs? - Right, their drive's back. Maybe it was an electrolyte overstimulation. I don't know. What do you think? - [Rosette] Well, I think good. So the charge is dropped against me? I can go home? - Yeah, we just have to finish processing your paperwork. Our mainframe has crashed. - Your mainframe's crashed? Okay. - I don't get it, first, the virus we traced disappears. Then the rashes disappear. The men all identified her, but she says she didn't do it. I wanna believe her, but there's so much evidence against her. It's very confusing. It's like Three Faces of Eve. - She couldn't have done it. - [Agent Hopper] All the men positively identify her. - You never believe me. I'm telling you, she didn't do it. - How can you be so certain? - I examined her medical records. - Virgin? - Like I told you, she couldn't have done it. If I were you, I would just leave well enough alone. Like [speaks foreign language]. - Oh, hello. - Mom, this is Ruby. Remember Ruby, she has her own portal. The writer. - Um, honey, honey, yes. - This is Ruby. - Hi, Ruby, honey, come here, come here, come here a second. No, no, no, no, no, we have to talk. Just one second, we'll be right back, excuse us. So that's her, the woman I told you about that I saw downtown with the preacher and she wouldn't let me into the elevator. - Okay. - And she runs around at night, I've seen her out of the window. - Mother, please, please. - What? - Do you remember? - Well of course. - Remember that? - Yes I do, you're happy. - She's responsible for that, okay? - So you like her. - Come here. - All right, it's his taste, not mine. I'm just the mother, God forbid I should judge. - Ruby, Mom, Mom, Ruby. - Well, hello. Oh! My son is not a gem, you know. He's got a lot of problems. - I like him. - Well, tell me, what do you see in him? I'm very curious to know. - He's what I need. - He's what you need. - He feeds me. - I feed her. - Oh. What do you think? - It's a beautiful color. - Yes, it's borscht. You know borscht? - I don't. - No? Ah. Well, I'll give you the recipe. - I have a recipe. It's a different, it's a different borscht, but it's delicious. - Well, we'll have to trade. Where you going, honey? Be down in 10 minutes. - No hard feelings. - [Rosette] No hard feelings. - I was just doing my job. - I was just doing my job, too. - I'm glad it was a case of mistaken identity. - [Rosette] Would you like some tea? - Sure. - Would you mind waiting here for a moment? I need to check my microwave. - Microwave? [Rosette gasps] [Rosette gasps] [Rosette gasps] - Ruby. I'm being rude. - Oh, oh what a wonderful story. She looks so happy. - We're free. She doesn't need us anymore. She hasn't even checked in with us. - I'm so sleepy. Can we sleep in your room tonight? I dream better in blue. [mystical electronic music] - Okay. [mystical electronic music] [computer bloops] [gentle ambient music] - Can we do it again? - Yes, we can. - Did you and Dirty Dick, were you? - Are you gonna tell me about your past? [ticking electronic music] - Can we do it again? - Sure. [ticking electronic music] [pulsing electronic music] [Rosette gasps] - [Rosette] Why'd you do it? There was no need to. - I know I didn't need to. I wanted to. Can you take over my portal today? But be a bit more robotic. You don't anyone to know you're real. - The user friendly reproductive system. - It's a whole new world in here. [pulsing electronic music] - Ruby, uh, can't be here today, obviously. She's taking care of dreams of her own. I'm here with some thoughts that I thought I might share with you. And some suggestions. The first thing that has been occurring to me recently is that our wildest dreams can become reality.
