* [grand majestic music] * * * * * * * * * * * [dog panting] Oh, Bear. Oh Bear, you've come to say goodbye. Yes, I'm going to miss you. [Bear whines] [Grandpa Sam] Tick tock, time to rock! Okay, it's time. C'mon Bear! I never imagined my future would involve wearing a blazer to work. [Grandpa Sam] Superhero Katie! Saving our environment one day at a time. I'm an advisor. It's a dream job, but it's in an office, in a city made of concrete. Well, I wish I could find you a job here in Homewood that was suitable for your talents. It's exciting. You're just starting on your journey. And I am an old man. So what I say must be true. Hmm. Must be. [they both laugh] What's important is what you think. I think I'm excited to find out! You have got strong roots. Stand tall. [Katie squeals] I'm moving to New York City! - Okay. - Yeah. Hey guys! Just wanted to say good bye! Bye Katie. Do they really need you right before Christmas? [Katie] They do. - You'll miss your dad lighting the tree at the Festival of Lights. I know. Next year, I promise! Good work with the tree. Happy holidays, guys. Bye! Ray! How's Susan? Chemo's all done. She's stronger every day. And I'm using the company Christmas Bonus to surprise her and the kids with a trip to Disneyland. - No way! That's great. - Yeah. Yeah. Go on all the roller coaster rides for me, okay! Definitely! Oh, there she is. Our new Sustainability Officer. I have big shoes to fill, but the eco practices you put in place for Jolly Lumber will be up to your standards. Good. And rule of thumb - give back more than you take. Merry Christmas! Jake. Ah! Studying for the Annual Christmas Lumberjack Competition. Nah, I already know everything I need to crush the records. Are we good? I don't want to leave with any kind of weirdness between us. I get it. You're worried things are going to look different here after you leave. Good luck with the competition. And if you really want to see a good cut, check out Marie Brown's technique. [scoffs] As if. She has the cleanest cut that competition has ever seen. Just saying. Anyway, I need to find dad. Don't get too comfy. Dad. It's time. I need a hug. Well, I'm working. I would have happily picked up an axe and worked for you. But we both know you wouldn't let that happen. So you gave up trees for skyscrapers because of me? Is that it? Please be happy for me. Your mom and I were so young when we got together. You have your whole life ahead of you. You know, when you were about four, you cried for three straight days when you found out that I cut down trees for a living. You made me promise that I'd replant every single one. It's the right thing to do! You changed the way I do business forever. You make things better wherever you go, Katie. That's why it's hard for me, seeing my little girl all grown up. But it's the right thing to do. Come on. [Katie] I'm going to video call you every Sunday. [Gordon] Oh good. Somebody from IT will be more than happy to show me how to do that, over and over again. [Katie laughs] Come on. You like the company. Don't forget - Sundays. Yeah, except the last Sunday before Christmas. 'Cause that day I will be winning the Annual Christmas Lumberjack Competition! Dad I thought you retired your chainsaw! Not this year. Someone from our family has competed for fifty years. My nephews are away at college. Your uncle's got a broken arm. So, it's my turn. It's tradition! Well be nice to Jake because his big, plaid-wearing heart is set on winning this year. [Gordon] We'll see about that. - Hey Gord. - Sam. Wanna come along for the ride? Grandpa made some cookies! No, I gotta get that machine working. Can you check in on grandpa for me when I'm gone? Sam doesn't need me. He could have a conversation with the paint drying on the wall. Well I don't want you to be lonely either. I'll be all right. I love you dad. Go get 'em Katie. * * Hey! Don't you dare become a Yankees fan! * * [Katie's phone buzzes] [Katie] Ms. Whitaker! I'm so excited to go to New York. I can hear that. You know, your enthusiasm is what got you this job, Ms Jolly. I will be at your office at 9 am sharp. Actually, that's the reason for my call. We're having a 7:30 breakfast meeting to welcome you. [chuckles] I hope that's okay? I'm mean, you're going to be a little jet lagged but... Um, 7:30 it is! Although the Rockies to Manhattan that's two time zones. I personally need at least five to get jet lagged. Actually, make it 7:10. Human Resources is going to need to see you first. Yeah, of course. Excellent. Well it looks like we're all set. Well thank you, Ms. Whitaker. I'm looking forward to meeting all your partners tomorrow. And I am looking forward to working with you. You know, you are going to be a breath of fresh air around this office. I'll see you soon. Thank you. * [traveling music] * *Ring the bell I'm coming home * *Gonna share that Yuletide glow * *The best part of the year you know * *Is Christmas Time * Want a cookie? I'm saving them for later. [laughs] Just like your mother. Can you check in on dad for me? Once in a while? I don't think he'd appreciate me checking in on him. He's so stubborn. People grieve in different ways. He doesn't realize that we all lost Carol that day. Not just him. Katie, I'm here for him whenever he wants. But who knows if that'll be anytime soon. [sirens] This road only leads to one place. The sawmill. It's probably nothing. [more sirens approaching] That is a lot of emergency vehicles for nothing. [sirens] Dad's not answering. He's probably trying to take care of whatever happened up there. No, no, no. We have to go back. Everyone at Jolly Lumber is family. I need to know everyone's okay. [Grandpa Sam] Okay. [Gordon's cries of pain] [Harrison] Is that the log that fell on him? [Gordon's cries of pain] Dad. Dad! Dad! Ma'am! I need you to stay back. That's my father! Honey, honey. If you want your father to keep his leg, you need to let me do my job! [Gordon's cries of pain] All right. Can you hear me sir? He'll be okay. You his daughter? It's okay. I'm here Dad. [breathing heavily] Katie. What are you doing here? Don't worry about that right now. All that matters is that you're okay. You're going to be okay. * * [Katie] Okay. We're almost there. There you go. Don't pull. There you go. - Ow! - Sorry! Have to work at getting through doorways. Who taught you how to drive? Oh right. It was me. Welcome home dad! Grandpa and I brought the Christmas boxes out of storage. - Yeah... - Oh, come on. I'll make some hot cocoa, we can blast the carols... Not this year. Dad. You're going to have to let us help you. Tea? [Katie's phone buzzes] [Katie] I'm afraid so, Ms. Whitaker. I apologize, but is there any way you could give me a bit more time to help my father settle? I am really sorry about your personal situation but we need you here, like yesterday. I can be there in a few weeks. I can work straight through Christmas to make up for it! You know, you are our first choice. By far. But I can assure you there are hundreds of eager applicants, just waiting to take your place. Please. I have worked my entire life for this. Your work on the preservation of green spaces, I will do everything in my power to help those policies pass. You don't have to convince me. The job is already yours and it starts tomorrow. I understand. Thank you. Isn't there anything I can do? Push my start date? The one thing I can't do. I'm sorry. Yeah. Me too. * * * * [Katie] Now I know that this is no fun, but you really have to stop being so hard on yourself. I bet you could get out of that chair by Christmas. To light the tree at the Festival of Lights! Yeah. Good bye to the Christmas Lumberjack Competition. Is that what you're worried about right now? A lumberjack competition? Those skills have been passed on through our family for generations. A Jolly man has competed in that contest for... For fifty years, I know. And now I'm the one who's letting everybody down. * [country music playing on record player] * [knocking at door] Gord! It's good to see you back on your feet. Well, not really your feet, but, you know what I mean. - Katie. - Jake. Look Jake, I'm sorry all this company stuff has fallen on your shoulders. These shoulders can handle the day to day. Unfortunately, you've got bigger problems to worry about. I was going through the accounting books today... Ah ah. This isn't the right time to talk about that. [Jake] So you knew? You have to seriously reconsider the Big Mountain Forest Products offer. What offer? I don't want to sell right now. All right. We can talk about this early next year. We might be past what you 'want' at this point. Okay! What's going on right now? [Jake] Jolly Lumber is burning money. Look, we had a few tough months, all right. Some old equipment, some terrible luck. Without a serious cash injection we'll barely make it into next year. What about a bank loan? We've already got a few of those. As far as I can see, we should cancel the Christmas Festival of Lights. [Jake] We need that sponsorship money back. That would be like canceling Homewood's Christmas. No. I won't do it! And no staff Christmas bonuses. My workers rely on those bonuses! [Jake] Your workers rely on their jobs! We have never not given Christmas Bonuses. Ray needs that money. He's planned a trip for his family. Hey, I'm not Scrooge. I'm trying to keep us alive. Tell me what to do. I can help Jake manage. I don't need you. Jake's been down there with me at the company for fifteen years. He knows it as well as I do. You need to get yourself to New York City! I'm not going to New York. I've already made up my mind. They've replaced me. It's done. Katie! There will be other jobs. You're the only dad I have. We'll figure this out together. So you're staying? That's enough for today. Dad needs to focus on healing right now. * * [Jake] I'm only trying to help. I know you are. * * [Katie] What would Marie Brown do? She'd grab an axe and chop all her problems to pieces. Too bad my life's already fallen apart. Your toss. Katie, I know things may seem bad right now... My father almost died! The family business is broke. And without the staff Bonuses and the Festival of Lights, Christmas may as well be canceled! And I lost a prestigious job, and I'm crashing in my childhood bedroom. You're bedroom is really cute. Not to mention, that my father trusts my ex-boyfriend with the family business more than me. Don't even get me started on Jake. I can't believe I ever dated him. Anything else I missed? Just the dartboard. Oh! * * [video call ringing] Ah, give me a minute fellows. [ringing continues] [Gordon] Marie Brown? Marie! This is a surprise. How long has it been? Too many years, Gordie. Since before we had wrinkles. You still don't. You're as beautiful as ever. And you're as generous as ever with your compliments. More handsome, though. I heard you were back. I was hoping to run into you in town. Yeah, I moved in with my sister a few weeks ago. But I'll tell you what I heard in town today. Something not so great about your leg. How're you doing? Fine. I'm just stuck in a cast for a few weeks. But I'll be as good as new in no time. I doubt it's as easy as that. Oh, sure it is. I get as much couch time as a man could ask for. And if I need anything, I just snap my fingers. And I'm sure your 'people' just love it when you snap. Listen. I'm just glad that you're okay. I guess this means you're out of the Christmas Lumberjack Competition, huh? Yeah. So much for our family tradition. Yeah. I hung up my axe a few years ago, too. So, uh, what brought you back? You know how the mountains are. They just... They just called me. I missed my sister. I missed her family. I missed a lot of things about this place. Well, I'm... glad you're here. Me too. Good night, Gordie. Good night. [Gordon] I haven't seen her in forever. [Katie] My dad doesn't want my help! I just wish mom was here. Yeah. Both Gordon and Sam must be really missing her right now too. Your mom... She found the silver lining in everything. She wouldn't want you to be sadly sipping beers when there are good fries to be had. The trick is, if you eat two at a time, it counts as one. [Katie chuckles] It might take some time, but I think your dad's going to be just fine. Hi. Could I have a menu and ginger ale. Sure, coming right up. Katie? It's not polite to stare at handsome strangers. That's the rude paramedic from dad's accident. Wait. What were you saying? Silver lining. Huh! I think I found it! Okay. Can I see that for a second? - Oh, sure. - Ah no. The brochure for the Christmas Lumberjack Competition. Actually, I was just reading right now. Well, great! I will too. - Okay... - Flip the page! Come on. Um... How's your father, ma'am? Still not ma'am. Just being polite. Fifty thousand dollars! That's the cash prize this year? My dad's about to be a whole lot better. Thanks! Okay. I can't bring my mom back, or make my dad walk, but I can swing an axe. I can honor fifty years of family tradition and if I win the grand prize then Homewood's Christmas is back on! That competition is a few days before Christmas. That's three weeks away! It's not like I'm learning the skill from scratch. Remember, I was a Junior Champ! You haven't picked up an axe in fifteen years. Muscle memory! It's in me. I always thought I had one too many fingers. Very funny. A competition like this, it takes serious skills. I mean, you could get seriously injured. I'll have safety equipment. Look, all I need is a good coach. Your father's just never going to go for this. Exactly why we don't tell him. You can train me. Come on, you can squeeze me in and Grandpa Sam can coach me in the mornings. It'll be our little secret! For your sake, I hope Sam agrees. Fine, fine. I can help you with strength, power and agility. But I am no lumberjack. So... [Katie] He's going to love this. Yeah. Yeah. Sure he is. * * [Katie] We'll get started bright and early. * * [very loud alarm clock rings] Uuurrrgggghhhhh... All of the events are based on traditional forestry practices. I love watching these guys. Standing Block Chop, Underhand Chop, Axe Throwing, Cross Cut Saw, Obstacle Pole. I was never good at the Obstacle Pole. It's easy. It's just a question of speed and balance. And not falling on a chainsaw. I can - not fall. Well, you better run through each one. So we know what to work on. Besides Obstacle Pole. All right! This is your target here. Go for it. Big swing, okay? Uh huh. * [upbeat music starts] * *I thought I had it figured out * *I thought I had it all but * *That was when you ran around * *Oh I can really feel it now * *Yeah we got a-ways to go but * *But at least we're not alone * *Baby you can lay your hair down * *If you wanna leave we'll go right now * [Grandpa Sam] Come on Katie! Good! Good! * I kinda like we get along oh baby * Yes! Go on Katie! *I'll be ready if the world goes crazy * *Just tell me what you need * *I'll never let you down * *No oh oh oh oh oooh * *Hey oh oh oh oh oooh * Ah! Blisters already! It's like coming home again. You really are in your element, Katie. We both know you can win this. [breathing hard] Oh boy. I'm exhausted. I love it though. [laughs] Well that's a good start. * * * * I know you want to cancel the Festival of Lights, and the staff bonuses, but please, for the love of all things Jolly - don't. Look, I know how to get the money to cover it. You're winning the lottery? I wish. But you can't tell my Dad. What if your idea doesn't pan out? It has to. It will! Why are you so sweaty? It's hot in here. Aren't you hot? Weird... * * [Katie] Dad? You want some breakfast? I'm getting hangry. You got to be a little more careful next time. Right? What's wrong? Nothing new. * * [whispers] He's the Paramedic. Well some people call me Harrison. Well, Harrison, um... There's no emergency here, so... I'm off the clock. I just came here to check in on your father. And while I'm here, could I have my brochure back? What brochure? Nothing, it's just, ah... Actually, your father here has agreed for me to help him out with his physical therapy. When he's ready. Wait. What? You told me I should let people help me. Maybe I can be the one to light the Christmas tree at the Festival of Lights. Especially if it's the last one. Dad! That's great. You know, Harrison here is new in town. Yeah. I can tell. So maybe you could show him around? - Oh, no. - What? I've some stuff I need to... You know he practically saved your old man's life right? * * Sure. I guess it's the least I can do. * * Pancakes! I will make you some pancakes. Hey, and, ah, whip up a few for Harrison here too. Will you? * * I love pancakes, actually. Who doesn't. * * [Harrison] Well this is probably not what you wanted to be doing this afternoon. Oh no. I love being set up on dates by my dad. You're showing the new guy around town. This is a very un-date. Well, ah, this is Main Street. It's mainly where everything is. Oh? Not named after Samuel P. Main? [laughs] There's the... Ow! - You all right? - Mmm. Sorry. I, ah, I hurt my shoulder playing... Playing darts last night. Oh. Well, we didn't cover dart related injuries in school,so... So, there's the Diner, the General Store for all of your... General needs. Wow. It's so... simple. Life is not simple here. Well it's a lot less complicated than New York so ah... Never heard of it. What? New York, New York. So nice they named it twice. [sings] I love New York. If New York is so great, why are you here? My dad brought me here as a kid. So you moved to the Rockies because you visited once? Are you sure you're not running from the police? * * [Harrison] So, you ever been to New York? [Katie] Um, yeah. I was supposed to move there for work. * * An Advisor at an Environmental Law firm. Oh wow. I don't peg you for working with lawyers. Me neither. I love nature. I like getting my hands dirty. I have a PhD in agriculture and forestry. Whoah! Impressive. Doctor. Okay. Calm down. Yeah, after I graduated I wanted to work at preserving the environment. But you love the outdoors. You live in the Rockies. It just seems so... Backwards to me. * * Okay. Enough talking about me. I'm sorry. Hey do you know a place called Falconer's Point? It was my father's favorite place. - Yeah. Falconer's Point. - Yeah. Yeah, it's a beautiful mountain view lookout. Named after Samuel P. Falconer. [Harrison laughs] Of course. Could we... uh... go? It's a little late for that hike. Besides, I don't think you'd get very far with those shoes. Oh no? What shoes do you suggest I wear? I don't know... hiking boots. - Hiking boots? Yeah, things are really simple here in Homewood. [Harrison chuckles] * * Wow! Look at that tree. It's almost as big as the one at the Rockefeller. Yeah, we decorate it during the Festival of Lights. And then my dad lights it. It's a really special night. Unfortunately, this will be the last year. But if you want to experience Christmas in the Rocky Mountains, that is the weekend to do it. I'm not feeling too Christmassy this year. Is it still on the 25th? Yup yup. Just like in New York. Ah yeah. Right right. Speaking of the Lumberjack Competition... Why didn't you want your dad to know about the brochure? He just seemed a little down about not being able to compete. So. I didn't want to rub it in his face, you know. Oh okay. Right. So then why did you take my brochure? * * Just trying to figure out a little bit. Yeah. It's going to take a little more than a brochure. Well, the General Store has a fine variety of maps that can tell you everything you want to know about the Rocky Mountains. No dad-forced un-date tour necessary. Oh great! I'll go check it out. - Ah, yeah, cool. - All right. Oh boy. Which way was it again? - It's over there. - Right. Owwwww! Better go ice that shoulder. And take it easy on those darts! - Yup. Thank you. - You're welcome. * * * * [alarm clock rings] [phone buzzes] Morning, sunshine! Tick tock, time to rock! Sam says you love that. You know you're not the coach in 'Rocky'! You're a bum, kid. I tell ya, you're a bum! [Amanda] Up. Get up. Get up. Get up up up. I'm outside. He's a tourist, here for a taste of the 'simple' life. I thought he moved here. He did. It's not nothing to just pick up and move across the country. He must be here for something. He doesn't even know what that is. And I've already used the whole 'running from the police' scenario. And that came up negative? Hey, tight core. So I'm guessing there won't be a second un-date? [struggles] No. I mean he's cute, but he's too moody. A big city know-it-all. Yeah. At 5 am, you're pretty moody too. Hey! Twenty-five crunches and I want core tight! No no! I can't, I'm too tired. This is when the real work begins. Okay? Come on, tick tock, time to... Stop! I'm sweating in places I have never sweat before. [scoffs] This is only half your workout girl. Come on! I'm doing all the actual work here. Promise me that you'll... Yes! Yes I promise. Yes! Sprints this afternoon to make up for whatever this is. I don't like it. * * Okay, now I want you to visualize yourself walking up to that podium, wishing everyone a Merry Christmas, and then lighting up that tree. - Got it? - Yeah. All right. There you go. I want you also to remember to put weight on your hands, not under your arms. - Okay. - How's that? It's good. It's good. Morning! Morning. Let's go. Keep going. On the arms. * * Amazing! [Katie] Marie wins again. * * [crashing noises] [Harrison] Whoa! [Harrison] I'm okay. I'm okay. * * * * Be careful out there on the ladder! I don't want to have to call the Paramedics. Yeah, I heard they can be real jerks. Ma'am. [Katie chuckles] Gord asked me to hang the outdoor lights. And I didn't realize how unskilled I am at wrapping yards of lights around big fat trees. Well I appreciate you helping, but you really don't need to do any of this. No, honestly, I like to help out another dad. My father passed, and, um, this will be my first Christmas without him. I'm sorry. * * It really helps if the lights aren't in a tangled mess when you start. Oh no. They weren't. This is all my doing. [they both laugh] - Here. - Thanks. * * You got hiking boots! Oh yeah. I got a hot tip. Apparently hiking boots are good for hiking. Are you going to Falconer's Point today? Nah. I'm still trying to find my mountain legs. You're going to have to jump in at some point. Ah, spoiler alert. I'm not really a natural at this outdoorsy stuff. - No way! - Way. [laughs] My dad loved fishing and hiking and I love video games and baseball. I almost went pro. For baseball. Ah. I guess I, I came out here to reconnect with him. * * That's really lovely. I still have a few thousand steps I need to get in today, and I know a great workout. No need to go to the gym. And it's free! - Are you interested? - Sure. Cool. I'll go grab my stuff. - Good luck with these. - Thank you. * * [Harrison] Just curious. How concerned do I have to be about being attacked by a grizzly bear right now? Those are the last words you say before a grizzly attack. No, I'm serious. I need to know. - For a friend. - Oh, I see. Well we have black bears but no grizzlies. Oh. Just black bears. Just black bears. That's just great. Okay. Perfect. Oh! [they both laugh] [Katie] Just straight ahead. It's the mountain lions you have to look out for. They actually track you from the trees. And they love a New York steak. Like mountain lions? Wait wait wait. Why are there lions in the mountain? They're the King of the Jungle! What more could they possibly want? Not to worry. You've got your pepper spray, you'll be fine. Pepper spray! I didn't pack my pepper spray. I didn't know I needed pepper spray for lions in the mountains! All right. Would tears of a grown man help scare them off? [laughs] Probably! Oh good. I could easily save us both then. Don't worry. I got you. Had it packed for New York. Of course. [Katie] It's nice to see you warming up. What, I was cold before? You were practically a snowman in the ambulance. The least you could've done is tell me my dad was going to be okay. I didn't know your dad was going to be okay. I didn't want to lie to you. Well. Your bedside manner needs work. As a Paramedic, I see people at their most vulnerable every day. I do what I'm trained to do. I just won't give people false hope. * * Not anymore. What do you mean? * * Before my dad died, he called me and told me his chest was tight. I was concerned, given his history and all. But I told him not to worry about it and he'd be okay. * * I told him to meet me at the ER. He never made it to the hospital. I'm sure your father was grateful that he got to talk to you that day. * * When I was 17, I was so angry with my mother because she wouldn't let me go to this park party. And to get back at her, I left for school without saying goodbye. * * She died a few hours later. Freak accident at Jolly Lumber. * * I never got to say goodbye. * * But I sometimes feel like she's still with me, you know? * * Do you notice that, too? Magic moments that tell you that the people you love are near. * * Come. * * * * You weren't kidding. - That was a good workout! - Told you! * * Wow. This view, what we're seeing right now, will never be the same again. It's alive. Changing, moving, growing. Every changing. [inhales and exhales deeply] Listen. [sounds of nature] [sounds of nature] My dad would love this. This is Falconer's Point. - It is? - Uh huh. I climbed all the way to Falconer's Point? [Katie chuckles] Wow. Dad was right. I've spent my whole life outdoors watching trees grow, be cut down, replanted and grow tall again. * * Areas of the forest that have been affected by fire will grow more lush than before. Did you know all those mountains were at the bottom of the ocean once? Ah. You're going to have to explain that one to me. No matter what happens, the natural world will always keep changing. Growing. Like us. * * [crunch of snow, twigs] [whispers] Mountain lion! Shhhh. Is that a...? [Katie] It's a doe. [Harrison] A doe? [Katie] A female deer. Oh. See? Magic moments. * * Thanks for this, Katie. * * Yeah, I should probably get back for my shift. I don't want to be late. Yeah yeah! Absolutely. Do you know any more hikes like this? I'd like to find more moments, like this. Yeah. Sure. I need to get my steps in. Let's go. * * [alarm rings loudly] * [upbeat music begins] * * * *I remember Christmas as a child * *Waking up to all those smells and sounds * *Racin' downstairs to see * *What might be under the Christmas tree * *Oh can I please please have that back? * [crunch of snow, twigs] * [music continues] * *That Christmas joy * *I once had as a boy * *That Christmas peace * *When heart and soul were both at ease * *That Christmas love * *I need more of * * * *I remember making all the gifts * *Cuttin' out birds of paper and seein they would lift * Ready, ready, ready. 2, 3... mush! [squealing] *Wrap them up with ties and bows * *Whatever's in there no one knows * * Oh can I please please have that back? * * * [song ends] Jake! What are you doing here so early? Funny. I was just about to ask you the same thing. Gentlemen, yes, right in here. Please, take a look around. I'll be right with you. [quietly] What do you think you're doing? You heard my dad. He's not ready to sell. We got to keep our options open. Which reminds me. The staff's been asking about their bonuses. What would you like me to tell them? I don't have time for this. Gentlemen... sorry about that. Where were we? * * [Harrison] Kind of like this? - Yeah. - Yeah. It's just so the oxygen can move through and keep the fire going. Who taught you all this about fires? Grandpa Sam. Ah. That's too bad that Sam and Gord can't spend Christmas together. Yeah. My mother brought them together. They haven't agreed on anything since she died. Well, they do agree on one thing. They love you very much. Oh! Problem solved! I'm sorry. It's just... - It's complicated. - Okay. * * I just figured out why dad loved the great outdoors so much. * * Hiking, the fresh air. Spending time with you is exactly what I needed. Yeah. Me too. * * You know, I was thinking... What if I started a camp for kids? To help them put down their screens down and get their hands dirty. Hiking, camping, tree planting, astronomy, building fires. That kind of stuff. You want to start an outdoors camp? Yeah. Yeah, I mean, kids these days are missing out on so much and they don't even know it! It's just, you didn't even know that the words 'hiking' and 'boots' went together. Exactly. We could work together! We'd make a great team. Right? Harrison. The hiking's been fun, but there are a lot of other things I really need to focus on right now. Yeah okay. I just... It was just an idea. * * Hey. Believe me, you have been the one good, honest thing to come out of this mess. * * [phone buzzes] Sorry. I got to get that. Uh huh. * * Hey, ah, do you maybe want to grab dinner tonight? Together. We can talk about the camp. I'm sorry. I got to work. But another night? Yeah? Yeah. * * * * I have to admit, this is nice. Well dad, we had to get you out of the house! But what could be better than dinner with my two favorite men? - Men? - Uh huh. Oh. Well thanks for the invite, but I'm not that hungry. Oh, come on you two, be nice. This animosity has gone on too long. Come on. Sit. I got you pizza! - Are those anchovies? - Your favorite! [Katie] Nobody else's favorite, just yours. This is evil. You're baiting me with a bait fish. So. I am reinstating weekly family dinners. Katie, we haven't done those for years. Not since mom died. All three of us loved her. And all three of us miss her. And all three of us need to eat dinner. So... Why not do it together? Family was the most important thing to mom, and it is to me too. So you two will see a lot more of each other, whether you like it or not. Ideally, you'll start liking it. You raised one stubborn daughter. Yeah. Just like your daughter. * * Is that Harrison? [Gordon] Yeah. Why don't you invite him to join us? [Grandpa Sam] Yeah. We'll finally have some decent conversation. [whispers] Why are you hiding? Harrison told me he was working tonight. Well he could still be on the clock. He's not wearing his uniform. Maybe it's casual Friday? Really? I guess he just didn't want to have dinner with me. * * Have a slice of pizza. * * It's been three days. Just ask him what happened! It's probably nothing! No, it's not nothing. Harrison wouldn't lie to me about dad's health in the ambulance. Why would he lie to me about his work? You like him. That's beside the point! If I'm going to win this competition, I need to focus. Really, it's for the best. It's for the best. So if you say it three times, does a genie come out of the chainsaw and make it come true? Harrison was a distraction... Ah! Are you okay? I'm calling 9-1-1. No, don't overreact. I'm fine. All right then, I'm calling Harrison! No! No! Stop! It's ringing. Really, it was just a little bonk on the head. No it was a medium bonk. What were you doing today anyway? I was distracted. Just clumsy. Here. Well you just got to take it easy today, get lots of rest and drink lots of water. You'll be fine. Any particular reason why you haven't returned my calls? I mean, if you didn't like the camp idea you should have just told me. Katie! Are you okay? Thanks for your help. I can take it from here. I'm fine. All right. Make sure she takes it easy today, okay Jake? Katie, I've got a pretty busy week this week, so... Maybe I'll see you at the Festival of Lights? Yeah, Katie and I will be there. You should come! Yeah, sure. Call if you need anything. Thanks. Stop that! Stop. Tell me, why are you sneaking onto private property? This is my dad's company! For now. I'm doing all I can to keep it afloat and you're sneaking off on predawn playdates with the new guy? I'm training for the Christmas Lumberjack Competition. The cash prize will cover the Festival of Lights and the Christmas Bonuses. Cute, Katie! So this is the big secret you didn't want your dad to know about? You know he wouldn't approve. Rightly so. You're already getting hurt! I'm not going to get hurt again. You're not going to train here again. Tell your father. Or I will. * * [Katie] Not only am I going to compete, I'm going to win. [Gordon] Katie... Dad I've been training for weeks. Grandpa and Amanda have been coaching me. Ah, I should have known you were involved in this! No, no, no, no. This was my idea. For Pete's sake, Gord, she's doing it for you! Just stay out of this all right. I'm not going to listen to you. If you'd only stop trying to control every little thing, we might not have been in this situation in the first place. Oh, I got us into this mess? If you hadn't encouraged Carol... I raised my daughter to follow her heart. And look what it got me. Grandpa it wasn't anyone's fault. Mom died in an accident doing what she loved, surrounded by the people she loved. We should all be so lucky. * * I'm going to win that fifty thousand dollars for the company. And don't tell me you don't need it! She's good, Gord. She has a real chance. Dad, please let me do this for you. * * And... She's a Jolly heir. She can carry on your family tradition. I didn't get these calluses for nothing! Those are pretty good. I know I'm not in New York right now. But I am in the best shape of my life. And I feel like I have a real purpose for the first time. And, ah, I don't know, maybe falling in love for the first time. Well, I sure hope Harrison is the one because I'm don't think I can survive having another tree fall on me. [Katie and Grandpa Sam chuckle] Listen. If you're going to this... There's somebody you should see. * * [Katie] You... Marie Brown... Are going to train me? I can't wait to see you in action, Katie. Might as well learn from the best. You two were really high school sweethearts? Were we sweethearts, Gordy? Is that what you told her? We don't need to waste any of your time talking.... I mean, you were pretty sweet. Listen, when they asked me to host the Competition I was so honored, you know working with new people and seeing old friends. I don't want any favoritism. Oh no no. You are not going to get any. Okay. It is just you and your axe against the clock. - Okay. - Okay. You got that? * * Well, I suppose you'll be wanting to come to Christmas dinner now. Oh yeah, sweetheart. Pffft! [laughs] The table's full. There's no room. No room! I'll make room. [Katie] Keeping my balance isn't the problem, it's keeping the chainsaw balanced. Okay. Let's slow it down. Get a good grip of the saw. Plant your feet, bend your knees. Sink down a little bit lower. There you go. Back up a bit. Start your saw. * * [Katie yells] [chainsaw starts] Ahh! That was better. That was good! Yes, and we'll just do it again and again and again until your body's like "I got this". Boom! Saw drop! But don't drop the saw. It's dangerous. And you'll be disqualified. Okay. Here we go! * * Look at these! [knock at door] [Grandpa Sam] Hang on. [door opens and closes] - Oh hi. - Hi! - [Gordon] Marie! - Hi! You look beautiful. Oww! Oh! You always look beautiful. Thank you. You're charming as ever, Gord. Sam, you didn't tell me Marie was coming. Well I told you I was inviting some guests. Wow, you still take decorating more seriously than anyone I know! It looks great. [knock at door] [Grandpa Sam] Oh, excuse me. - Marie! - Hey. - It's so nice to see you. - You too. - Come in. - Thank you so much. So, are you all ready for tomorrow? Absolutely. Thanks to you. That's why I'm here. * * - And this is my other guest. - Hi. * * That's a surprise, Grandpa. [Gordon] Harrison! This is Marie. - Hi. - Hi Marie. How are you? - Good thanks. How are you? - Great. * * Yummy. [Harrison] Is there anything I can do to help? No. I'm almost done. Wow. This looks incredible. I didn't think I was going to get a Christmas dinner this year. Thank you. For everything. - You can grab the salad. - Okay. * * [indistinct chattering, laughing] Did I see some dessert out there in the kitchen? Already? Wouldn't you like to wait a little bit? No, I'm switching it up this year. - Okay. - I'll give you a hand. Nice one, Sam. Wish I'd thought of that. Marie, I wonder. Can you do me a favor? Sure. Um, the tree still needs some decoration, what with Gord's leg and all. He can show you where the ornaments are. Oh yeah, no sure. I'd love to. I noticed there were some empty spots. Gord usually goes for perfect. So yes, let's go do that. I'll send in some dessert. Yeah, you'd better. Come on, Sam. I'm too old to be chasing after girls. Old? [chuckles] You just add a couple of decades, and then you can say you're really old. And you're never too old for that. My leg was practically crushed. Oh, come on Gord. It's not that chair that's holding you back. Go for it. How are you so annoyingly positive? It's a knack. It's a knack. Lucky us. Mind the table. It's an antique. - Oww! - An antique! Antique! You're an antique. * * You look stunning tonight. [laughs] You clean up nice yourself. I barely recognized you without your hiking boots on. - Is that lemon meringue? - Uh huh. My mom's recipe. Can I have a... What? - Get the plates. - Okay. I'm really glad you came tonight. Are you feeling the holiday spirit? Yeah, I'm starting to. How's your head? Still attached. Rattles a bit when you shake it? Uhhh. No more than usual. Hey hey hey! Get out of there. That looks nice, right? Oh my goodness. This is adorable. That's new this year. It's fitting, isn't it. What else we got in here? Okay, this one. This is something that Katie made in kindergarten? Sadly I think that might be from the sixth grade. Sixth grade? Okay. She's better with an axe than a glue gun, I guess. Yeah. Okay. That's looking good. You know. I think it's looks just about perfect. I think so too. * * Katie. I was going to ask... You and Jake, um... Oh. No no. No we're not together. Definitely not. We, um, we used to date, but it was not a good fit. Oh. Because your heart-rate spiked when he came in the other day. So... Well, he's not exactly one of my favorite people these days. What about you? Are you, uh, seeing anyone? No. No. There's this girl I really like but, ah, she stopped returning my calls. So... The other night when you said 'no' to dinner because you had work, I saw you on Main Street. And you weren't working. Oh. No no no. I was going to my personal trainer. It's part of my work. I'm sorry. I... I got to keep in shape as a Paramedic. Yeah... I may have over reacted a queency bit. Queency? Not a word. - That's a word. - No. Yes it is. Look it up. It's a word. It's not a word. I guess I just thought that you didn't want to have dinner with me. Ah. Okay. We have to fix that because that is the last thing I ever want you to think. * * Thanks for dinner. You're welcome. I should. I should probably get going soon. So... Uh huh. Are you going to the Competition tomorrow? I'm planning on it. Yeah. Cool. I'm going too. - Cool. - Yeah. Um... Don't worry about the dishes. I'll finish that later. All right. I'll see you. * * [Garth V.O.] Welcome to the 50th Annual Homewood Lumber Competition. There are a lot of great competitors this year and well be bringing you all the action live. With Garth Scott and former Homewood Lumber Champion Marie Brown. Have you seen Harrison? He was supposed to be here. No I don't see him. But I want to thank for taking care of your head injury. There was no head injury! Hey he still took care of you. Oh! I'm going to be sick. [Grandpa Sam] You're going to be okay. Deep breaths. Remember your training. You got this. You got this! Yeah yeah. I got this. Good luck. From the core, Katie. Always from the core. Okay. - Marie! - Hey you. Are you ready to show these guys what you're made of? - Yup! - All right. Listen. Don't you dare hold back. Every swing counts. - Okay. - You've got this. - Gordon. - Hello Marie. - How are you? - Better for seeing you. Oh. Thank you. See you. Got this. Not a word from you. [Katie chuckles] [Gordon] Katie. This axe is for you. Every Jolly has competed with it. For luck. It's yours. You're going to make us all very proud today. - [Marie] Good morning Homewood! - [Katie] Thanks Dad. [Marie] And good luck to all our Lumberjacks and Jills competing today. Sit tight just a couple more minutes as I ask my competitors to make their way to the stage. [Marie] Just a reminder, athletes. We'll be holding the heats for only three events today. The top competitors will advance to the final two events tomorrow. You'll need to finish fast for the win guys. * * What are you...? - Are you competing? - Yeah! Yeah. It was one of my goals in moving here. Urgh! You and your goals! My dad loved these competitions. You know it's a new physical challenge. I can't believe this is happening. Wait! Is that why your arms were sore? And the brochure! Why didn't you tell me? I didn't tell anyone! Well, until everyone found out. What's your Dad think of this? Is he okay with it? Yeah. Yeah he is. Jolly Lumber could really use the cash prize right now. Besides, I'm really good at it. Okay guys. We're live in 30 seconds. Jake Pritchard you're on stand one. Ted Kanoe stand two. Katie, I really like you. And I don't want to jeopardize that. So if you want me to compete next year, it's totally cool. No no no. I want you to compete. I like you too. I just want to be with someone who can challenge me to be my best. Let's see what you've got. Let's see what you've got! [Marie] Our first event today - Standing Block Chop. Those babies are twelve inch diameter pine blocks. Get ready for some hard hits today because those axes are razor sharp. Strength plus accuracy. Let's see what you've got, Jacks and Jills. In three, two, one... Go! The axe is sinking deep. That is some great chopping by Harrison. Oh, it looks like Katie's got a firm block of wood there. Wood chips are just flying, it's a close race. [Marie] It is down on stand one. Jake Pritchard takes the heat. [Gordon] That's a good time. Good time. She'll be all right. Way to go Katie! [Marie] After Standing Block, Jake Pritchard tops the leaderboard followed by Harrison Brock. Stick around folks. We got a whole lot more action coming your way. [Garth] It is the Underhand Chop. Standing on a block of wood, chop halfway through the front side, turn around and chop out the backside. You got to watch those toes though! May the best man win. You got it pal. In three, two, one... Go! [cheering] [Garth] Jake is first to the back side of his block! * * [Garth] And that's down on stand one. Jake is on top. Eight in the front and ten in the back. Ha ha ha. Yes! [Garth] Here we go in three, two, one... Go! [Garth] Katie's first hits are looking great. That axe is sinking deep. [cheering from crowd] [Garth] On stand two, powering through the front side, putting in drivers and making the turn. Beautiful chopping by both of them. A beautiful cut by Katie Jolly! [Garth] Axe Throwing equals focus. Can our Jacks and Jills tune out all the distractions? * * [Garth] Great toss! [Garth] And it just cuts the line, It's close but that throw counts! [Garth] Oh, threw that one away. [cheering, clapping] [cheering, clapping] [Garth] And that's a bulls eye! Harrison with a perfect throw. Katie's going to need a bulls eye to win this one. [Garth] And... Katie Jolly wins axe throwing. Come back tomorrow, help us carve the winner's name into history. [cheering] You did yourself proud today, Katie. And you also did a number on your shoulder. Let me take a look at it, huh? It just not good enough. I want to be higher up on the leaderboard. You're in fourth place! You're just a couple points back. - Here. - Ah! A little chilly. You did awesome out there. Hold that there. Blood sugar... and water. Okay? Okay. [Katie's phone buzzes] Do you mind? No. Not at all. Katie! Thanks for getting back to me so soon. Yes of course. Well, thank you for calling! You know how much I respect Smythe Environmental. I really miss your passion for the environment. Listen, I have some good news for you. Great. It's my lucky day. Mine, too. Your replacement didn't quite work out. And our green space preservation hearing has been moved to February. And I remember you saying that you'd be willing to work over Christmas. We'd love to still have you. We just need you to start immediately. Wow! Uh... * * * * - Thank you. - Thank you. [sniffs] I love anchovies. Do you want some? Hey. I know it was a tough day. But are you okay? * * The plan was always for me to leave. You and me? Not part of the plan. I thought we were having a great time together. The New York law firm called. They offered me the job back. That's amazing! I mean, you always wanted to move to New York, right? Yeah, but I... But what? My dad needs me. Your dad is improving every day. And Marie is happy to spend time with him. But what about the camp? My camp was just a little idea I had. I have no idea if it's going to work. With the law firm, you could really help make a difference in environmental practices. That's what you want, right? So you don't want me to stay? [Harrison] That's not what I'm saying. But everything you're saying is about me going. Not even a little bit about wanting me to stay. What about us? * * Katie you can't stay here just for me. * * I need some air. Katie! I... Katie! * * * * You know it's a bad idea to pack a suitcase while you're crying. [sobs] I just unpacked, and now... Katie. If I stay... I don't even know if I can win the competition. And if I go... I don't know if I want to sit in an office day in day out. I love it here. I have my family. The mountains. Harrison. [sobs] Harrison wants me to go. [sobs] I thought we had something... Really great, you know. You did, honey. That's why it hurts so much. Look. You don't have to worry about winning. I made a deal to merge Jolly Lumber with Big Mountain Forest Products. All of our employees are going to have secure, well paying jobs in January. It will be okay without a Christmas bonus. Dad, no. They're big but Marie helped me see that they got the same family values. It's a good offer. Marie and I are going to sponsor the Festival of Lights, personally. Big Mountain is going to take on my whole crew and they're going to make Jake the manager. Are you sure that's what you want? I've been working my whole life. Since I was a kid. I'm ready to retire. I'm ready to try to be happy again. Marie has a camper van. And she thinks I might be a good navigator. [laughs] I'm so happy for you, dad. I can't decide for you. But I can't wait to see what you do next. * * Thank you. That's what I'm here for. * * [Harrison] Morning boys. Morning. [Jake] Heard Katie left ya. She's a wild woman, can't be tamed. What do you mean, "Katie left"? I heard Sam drove her to the airport. Don't worry bro. I've been there before. She didn't even say goodbye... * * * * * * Santa Claus has come to town so get your jingle bells ready for some Christmas Cheer. First event of the day is the Cross Cut Saw. [Garth] And it's not for the faint of heart. First pair: Ted Kanoe and Harrison Brock. [Amanda] Harrison! You okay? You're up! Right, right, right. [Katie] GO HARRISON! No no no no. Don't look at me [Katie] WIN! [Garth] And in three, two, one. Go! [cheering] [Garth] And that is a great time for Harrison and Ted, but will it hold up? You came back? * * I brought you snacks. What about New York and your job? Your camp's going to work! We can teach kids how to fall in love with nature so they can grow up to want to protect it. I want to build something special. With you. Katie... Come here. [Garth] Oh that is the sweetest, you two. [Katie whispers] Are we on TV right now? [Garth] Wave to the camera. We need to crown a winner today! [Garth] Jake and Katie are up next. [cheering, clapping] So, you came back. Again. Sorry to tell you, but you're too late. I'm going to win this competition. Hey, I heard about your promotion. What promotion? You're manager at the Jolly Lumber division of Big Mountain Forest Products. I don't want to cry right now, Katie. I want to win. For your dad! [Katie] Let's do it. In three, two, one... Go! [cheering] [Garth] They are ripping through that wood. [cheering] [Garth] A great cut! Like a hot knife through butter. Katie Jolly and Jake Pritchard earn top points for the cross cut saw! [Garth] Topping our leaderboard: Jake Pritchard, Katie Jolly and Harrison Brock. Over to you, Marie. Don't you fret. We've the best one yet. The Obstacle Pole is next! Let's see that speed and balance, athletes. Chainsaws in hand, they will race up the inclined log, start their saws, make their cuts and race back down to the winner's circle. * I thought I had it figured out * *I thought I had it all but that was when you ran around * *Oh I can really feel it now * [Marie] In three, two, one... Go! And they're off! Harrison is on first. Oh and Katie is light on her feet. Here they go. Who's going to get to the top first? * * [Marie] Oh! And Harrison goes down. That's a tough break! *I kinda like we get along oh baby * *You can let your hair down * *Ride around a small town * *I'll be ready if the world goes crazy * *Just tell me what you need * [Marie] Jake has finished his cut. And so has Katie. Oh it's close. A foot race to the finish! They're neck in neck. * * And Katie Jolly has won the Obstacle Pole! She's won the Christmas Lumberjack Competition. * * Whoo!! Whoo!! *I'll be ready if the world goes crazy * *Just tell me what you need * *I'll never let you down * * * [Katie] Ray you're going on a vacation! * * Thank you for joining us at the Homewood Christmas Festival of Lights. And Happy Winter Solstice, everyone! [clapping, cheering] Winter Solstice? Yeah. It's the shortest day of the year. Our days only get brighter from here. Oh. We watched as Katie raced her way to the top of the winner's podium today. Oh yeah! Now, are we ready to light up the night? [Crowd] Yes! Yes! It is my pleasure to introduce our sponsor, lumber entrepreneur and all around great guy, Gordon Jolly! [cheering, clapping] [Man in crowd] You can do it! [cheering, clapping] All right. Thanks. That's enough. Thanks. I just want to say how happy I am to be here with all of you tonight. And I want to thank my family, and my employees at Jolly Lumber. And a few new friends. Now, on behalf of my family, I would like to wish everybody a Very Jolly Christmas! [cheering, clapping] You can do it with me. You ready? [gasps from the crowd, cheering] - It's beautiful. - It really is. The days only get brighter from here huh. [Katie] Come over here. * * * * [Katie] I've never hiked up this direction. Are you sure you know where you're going? [Harrison] Of course. That's what maps are for! We're here. [Katie gasps] Harry it's beautiful! You decorated it for me? * * [Harrison clears his throat] * * Katie Jolly, I want to grow deep roots here in Homewood, with you. And I want to spend the rest of our lives adventuring together. I love you. Will you marry me? Yes! * * Wow! * * [Katie] I love you. [Harrison] I love you too. * * * * Merry Christmas Katie. Merry Christmas. Let's hike. - Okay. - Yeah? [laughter] But I promised Sam we'd be back for his turkey dinner. [Katie] Oh. This is the best Christmas I could have ever dreamed of. * * *Ring the bell I'm coming home * *Gonna share that Yuletide glow * *The best part of the year you know * *Is Christmas Time * *Put those presents by the tree * *Spend some time with family * *Colored lights for all to see * *It's Christmas Time * *Ohhh ohhh ohhh * *Can you feel it the air * *All the love we're gonna share * *Ohh ohh ohh * *We've been waiting the whole year * *Now it's Christmas time again * * * *It's Christmas time again * * *
