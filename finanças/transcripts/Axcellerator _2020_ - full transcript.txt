All teams move in. - Code three, all units. - All units, target confirmed. - 10-32 units four through seven hold. - Subject is in black SUV. - I'm stealing this car. - I hate to break it to your bud, but I'm kinda already stealing it. - Then drive. - What? No, no, no, no, no, this can't be happening. - Look, in about 60 seconds, a bunch of guys with guns are gonna kill us both if you don't do as I say, drive! - Hey man, I don't know if you had like a really shit day at work or something, believe it or not, I can relate. - Shut up and drive! - Okay, all right, all right. - Here they come! - I want the device. - Let's move! - Go! - Well, there's no returning this thing now. - Go, go, go, man go! - Drive faster. - What, did you steal from a classic car club or something? - They take anything they want. - Jesus! - Do you mind telling me what the hell's going on. - I made a mistake. - What? - I made something, something that could change everything the whole world but, I shared it with the wrong people. - I didn't know. - Okay, well that literally could not explain any less information as to what is going on? - I can't explain it. I have something, these people chasing us because they want it. - I'm assuming it's in the case. The thing they want? Not the most discreet method of transporting important secret things, just FYI - Oh this is perfect, I hitched a ride with a car thief, who also happens to be a sarcastic horse's ass - You did not hitch a ride, you hitch a ride with a thumb not a gun! - What's with that suit anyway. - I was at a funeral - You wore THAT to a funeral? - Look out! - Hey, I hate to further my impression as a sarcastic dick, but that gun might be useful to shoot at the people that are shooting at us! - It's a pellet gun. - And we're going to die! I'm not a car thief, by the way. - I don't care. - My old man was a car thief, it was his funeral. - I'm sorry, ours could be next. - I was supposed to leave to go back home this morning but I had one thing I just had to do. - I should be getting on a plane right now. - Where is it? - What? We gotta get the hell out of here. - Home! Where is home? - New York City, Why? - Put your hand on this. - Uh, no thanks. - The device, put your hand on it. - Shoot, shoot! - What is this? - It's what they want. - I can get you out of this. Okay? You just have to trust me. - Okay! - Go, go! - We haven't done human testing yet, but it should work. - Wait, what?! - The arrogance of humans, they somehow think they are superior to the rodent population. - All right, all right, just tell me how it works. - Think about where you live, the address, the neighborhood, the inside of your apartment, what it looks like, every sense you can imagine. - Okay, got it. - Can you see? - Yes I see it. - Do you wish you were there? - Yes. - Do you?! - Yes, YES!

So what do they know. - Not much. - Two were inside that SUV, and we have zero information. - well I'm not surprised, have you seen what was left? - Who hasn't? Tomas Hawks is dead. No one could have survived that blast. The case the device was in, is charred. But the accelerator is gone, and no one was seen escaping. - So what that tell us? - The goddamn thing works, any progress tracking it down? - Nothing at this time. - Damage control? - Amanda's on it now, she's already got an edit on all the new stories. - Let me be very clear on this Sy, word on this cannot get out. - I agree, but there are clarity of detail issues. - No witnesses, no outside knowledge. - I wanna send someone in who can help us get the job done. I was considering sending Brink. - He is terminated as an asset. - No, he can help us get what we want. And he can cut down on any unforeseen problems. - Brink is a psychopath, walking collateral damage, Sy you have a small army at your disposal, will you use it and bring this thing back? Or there will be a troubling lack of inter-agency cooperation. - Ray, why that has to be the most polite veiled threat, I've ever heard. - So, there must be a reason you didn't share the news about the giant magnetic surge in lower Manhattan? - The teams are en route. - Because that could be considered as operationally sort of a hostile act. - We don't have a precise location yet. Besides this is how we keep our edge. - Well, I'm not sure that's a good excuse... - Amanda? Information is power. When the team lands I want the jet refueled and ready to go. - Going somewhere? - To see an old friend. - In Miami, federal authorities have confirmed that yesterday's pursuit and the subsequent explosion of a stolen SUV near the Miami International Airport was in fact a foiled terrorist attack. Miami police working with both Homeland Security and the NSA have reported that a suspect whose identity has not been released was killed in the attack. Other details are expected to emerge as authorities continue to collect evidence at the crime scene. - I've gone crazy and this is insanity, tightening its grip around my brain, or it's a brain tumor. No, it's emotional, it's the, after effects of a traumatic stress related emotionally induced hallucination. Or you're dead. Is that this is, am I dead? Nope. I'm alive. - Dane, open up. This is your landlord, you're two month behind on your rent. I know you're in there, I hear you talking to yourself being a weirdo. You been duckin' me for two weeks you little shit... - may have been a man named Tomas Hawks, a former government scientist who also may be part of... - I can hear you moving around if you don't open up, I'm gonna unlock the door and I'm coming inside. - Kate Dalton to the office, Kate Dalton to the office. Kate, I'm so glad you finally decided to join us. - I'm sorry. - This is the second time you've been late this week. - I'm really sorry. My dog Roscoe was sick and I had to take him to the vet and today was the only time they could see him. - Sure sure, use whatever excuse you'd like. Regardless, Val-Mart policy against tardiness is very strict, one more write-up and you'll be terminated. - But I really can't afford to lose this job. - I know, but it's sick dog or no job. I'd dump the dog and find yourself a guy so you can afford to be late. - That's pretty cold Mr. McGuire. - Don't worry, I'm sure Prince Charming is going to just drop out of thin air and just whisk you away. - Hi! - Who are you? - Where that little shit go? - What just happened? - I don't know how to explain in science terms, but... - No, stay away from me! - Please stop. My landlord is gonna hear you, here just... Sit, please, no one's gonna hurt you, you're not in any danger just please don't freak out. Okay? - What is happening? Where am I? - Well, this is my apartment, It's little, you know. - We are in a city. - New York. - I was just in Arizona. - What's your name? - Kate. - Hi Kate, I'm Dane it's nice to... - Perfect. - That's bad. I should have guessed. - What? - Your, ah... name. - Oh, yeah. Right. Okay, look. You seem like a nice guy or whatever and I'm really trying to hold it together but I'm also very close to losing my shit again. So please, what is this? - I know, right? That is exactly how I felt. That thing. That, takes a person from one place into another place, it took me from Miami to here and then here to you, and then brought you back here... with me. - Are you like a crazy person? - Were you not just with me a few seconds ago in Val-Mart? - I was. - Did you close your eyes during the whole teleportation through space bit, no, I bet that you probably missed it cause you had your eyes closed. - No. Okay, I get it. I get that I was someplace else, and now I'm here. But teleportation, it isn't real. - Well, I mean, yeah, I would like normally a hundred percent agree with you but I'm going to say based on the last two times that I've done it, maybe it is. - How? Did you make this thing? - No, no, I did not make that. I was in Miami and I was being carjacked, and this guy had this thing on him and I touched it and thought of home and then, here I am. - Wait, so if you just think of where you want to go, this thing takes you there? - I guess, yeah. - How'd you end up at the store? - See, I don't know, that doesn't make any sense. I'd never even been there before. - Well can it get me home? Can I use it? - Yeah, I think. I mean, it should be able to... then again, we could wind up on the moon for all I know. - You look good. - I've been in solitary the past five years. - What a surprise... - What do you want Sy? - You know for a man who just got released from three consecutive life sentences in a Supermax prison... you're pretty grumpy. - It's my natural state. - I need you to get something done for me. I cashed in a lot of chips to get you out. I need that object. - What the hell is it? It looks like a toy. No, that's my way out. - You get me that thing, I'll let you disappear. - Black Op? - My Op. Talk to me only. - Any leads? - There was a magnetic surge in New York yesterday and one today in Arizona. - Do I get my toys back? - You give me that thing, it's going to be Christmas morning. - Focus on where you live, think about what it looks like, see it? - Yes. - Do you see it? - Yes, I already said I did. - Okay, sorry, he just asked me the same thing a bunch of times so I don't know. - It's okay. - All right, so now just put your hands on it, do that and just hold my hand. - What? Why? - So I can go with you... Or, so I can go with you so I can take the device back with me. - Okay. - What did you think I meant? - Nothing. - What? - Nothing, just shut up and give me your hand. Am I supposed to say something? - Like Beam Me Up? I don't know, I've never had to un-hostage myself from future technology. I don't now what the rules are. - Okay, just relax, remember where you were. Imagine yourself there. Are you still thinking about it? - Yes. Are you positive this is how it works? - No, I have no idea how it works either, I just know that the guy who made it "Wizard Of Ozzed" me here by telling me, to "think about home," with a pellet gun to my head. - Okay, so, maybe it's like not intense enough? - We were in a car crash and there were people shooting real bullets at us too. - Okay, I cross the line at, pellet guns. - You know, maybe it's broken, like from the fall whatever, Maybe it just stopped working. - So I'm just stuck here then? I'm 3000 miles away from home, my phone is destroyed and all I have in my pocket is a $20 bill and a dog treat. - Okay, I'm sorry. Most of my finances are tied up at the moment. Credit Card? - Maxed. - Me too. Maybe you could call someone and borrow money? - No, there isn't anyone. - Okay, okay. We'll, we'll figure this out. - I'm literally stuck here. What am I supposed to do? Go steal a car and drive home. - What? That is so funny. No, we don't know how to steal a car. - So what then? - Well, my dad knew a guy, he could fix almost anything. He only lives a couple floors up. We could take this to him, maybe he can help. - Hey? Yeah, it's Kate. I just wanted to check in on Roscoe. What'd the doctor say? - He's resting, and still needs medication. - How much is that gonna cost? - Not sure, Probably over like $300. - Okay, uh... Yeah, that's fine, just have them go ahead then. - Okay. - And can you please let him outside as much as possible? - Sure, I'll do that. - Yeah, he really likes that. - Okay? - Okay, great. - Bye. - Bye. - Boyfriend at the hospital? - Labrador Retriever at the vet. Why would my boyfriend need to be let out? - Good point. - Is that what your girlfriend does for you? - No, I can't get one to let me in. - The team is getting closer. They're attempting to triangulate the source of the search. - So this thing can be tracked. Thank God, where's Sy? - I don't know, he took the jet after the team landed. - Well stay on him, I want to know everything he does. You remember who's in charge. - My loyalty has always been to the company. But Sy is Tier One special ops. - I don't care what dark agency he runs, you're a spy, spy on the man. Keep me informed. - Hawks torched his whole lab. He put a drill press through every hard drive. - Well if agent Graham's right Sy's men should have the axcellerator soon. - Holy shit! What is this? - It's kind of a long story. - I just spent three and a half hours in coach next to a screaming baby, that was a long story. - Yeah, We don't have time for ours. - You left the funeral early. Your aunt wanted to catch up kept saying how much you look like your old man. - That's what everyone says. - I joked, you certainly have his skill set. - No, not really. - What'd he do? - Well, he and I... - Let's rehash old stories once we figure out how to get this to work. - First of all, I never seen anything like this. - What kind of car you say you got this from? - It doesn't come from a car Louie, It's like, a scientist-made thing that teleports human beings from one place into another. - Ah that's good. That's funny. - I'm not joking. I can't figure out how to get it to work. - He's telling the truth. - Louie, remember how my dad always said that you could just look at something and know how to fix it? I was kind of hoping that'd be the case with this. - Dane, I used to run an auto body shop, Remember? I don't know nothing about something like this. If it is whatever you say - It is, trust me. - I do Dane you're family. Where do you even get something like this? - I'm telling you, the guy who made it, after the funeral, I went, for dad, kind of like a ceremony. - I see. - Wait, what ceremony? Why are you talking in code? - I Like her. Where'd you guys meet? - He took me hostage. - What? No, she's joking. We met on a dating... - Website. - Look, Louie, there were people after this guy and he gave me this thing and they were bad people. They had guns, he was scared. Could have been like government or army, I don't know. - Excuse me. You seem to have left out those important details when you told me this earlier. - Sorry. - Dane, I don't know what this is or where it's from. But, if it doesn't belong to you, then it belongs to someone else. And, like any boosted car, when someone has property that doesn't belong to 'em, the person who it does belong to is out there looking for it. - Unfortunately, as a matter of Val-Mart policy, I cannot discuss employee issues with an outside party. But, anyway, I've already reported this to the proper authorities. - No, you didn't. Matter of fact, you're not sure what you saw. The others told me that her name was Kate. Now, I could find out the rest from your files. - Sir, did you pay for that? - Not yet, I need to know where this Kate is. - I can't help you. And who are you again? Do you have a badge? - Mr. McGuire... You don't even require a background check with this item. I don't know what agency you're with, but I can't stand people like you. - People like me - Opening things before you pay for them and disassembling them, like the rules don't apply to you. Like you're special or something, because you're an officer of the law? Well, it's shoplifting really - Funny, though. - It's disgusting. - This thing is as deadly as any firearm - Oh wait... - Shouldn't of lied to me, Mr. McGuire. - You're like a son Dane, I wish I could do more to help you, I really do. - I know. Thanks Louie, I really appreciate you trying. - Anytime. Don't hesitate to reach out, you know that. - That's a nice girl you wound up with too. - No, no we're... - We're just traveling companions on the great teleportation highway for now. - Hope that works out. - Hey, do you happen to have that old Mustang? - Told you I sold it last month. Gotta pay the rent. I got a used Prius. - Please tell me that's a joke. - Times change. - Everything all right? - Exactly how attached are you to that Prius? - Hey what happened back there? - I got a message, people are coming here, after this thing. - From who? - I don't know. - Are we supposed to trust that? - I don't think we have much of a choice, come on. - Go! - You have your seat belt on? - Yeah. - Lets hope these things are tougher than they look. - Why? - Who is this now? - I don't know, but I think they're related to the guys with guns. - What are you doing? - Relaxation breathing. - Are you okay? - No, I'm not okay! I wasn't expecting a high speed car chase so quickly. Or ever! - I get it, I mean, it's only my second one. In a very short period of time, but I promise we're gonna be okay. You keep driving like this, you're gonna kill us. - Okay, okay. Keep doing the breathing thing. Shit! That was a nice car. - What the hell? - I hope Louie has insurance on this thing. - This is madness. - We're getting great gas mileage though. - It's the police! We're going to jail. Nope. Been there, done that, not again. - What? What were you in jail for? - Did I actually say that out loud? - Yes, you did. We should just surrender. - Not today things are too weird. - we got to find a different car. We need one that's um... - Not covered in bullet holes? Like a bullet hole filled piece of Swiss cheese made out of a car? - Are you okay? - Am I okay? No I'm great. Just great. I mean, before this my only concern was having to deal with a customer with too many items in express checkout. And now it's trying to find a replacement getaway car post high speed chase after being shot at by a helicopter. - We need to find another car, a fast, supercharged, bulletproof car. - Well you sure did pick a hell of a replacement. - It was the best available option. A lot of new models have electronic alarms, computers on board. And besides I mean it's not too flashy and we won't draw attention to ourselves. - Especially if we end up at a convention for soccer moms. - What? - How'd you know how to do this? - Do what? - Oh I don't know the whole real life Grand Theft Auto simulation. How did you in a matter of seconds professionally steal a car? - I wouldn't say it was professional it's more in a panic necessity, You know? - Cut the bullshit, just tell me the truth. - Okay, fine, fine. My dad was like one of the best car thieves, ever. - Now, you steal cars? - No. Now I deliver pizza. I left Miami, had to get out of that life I moved to New York, and Louie, he knew my dad. They were old friends. He hired me and I worked at auto body shop with him until he retired. Louie is more like a father to me that my real one. - Sweet guy. - Yeah, Louie is actually the one who convinced me to go to the funeral. I hadn't seen my dad in years. And he got shot boosting someone's SUV and I thought as a kind of tribute, whatever that I'd, finish the job. But as I was stealing it, someone points a gun at me, shows me a device. - And you transported through space from a car in Miami and into your apartment in New York? - Bingo. - I mean really still sounds so insane to say it out loud. - I know the whole, stealing thing is stupid. It just made me not feel as lost as usual. - Maybe I should try it. - What do you want? - That's a sweet ride. Hey, hey. I wouldn't blame yourself on the hiding spot, it happens. Where do you think Dane would go after he dumped your car? You think Kate stuck with him? - Who are you? - I've been thinking about that a lot. Of course you're not asking the philosophical sense, are you? Where are they Louie? - Why do you wanna know? - I really don't have time for games, it might be best if you just answer the questions. But then again, I'm always up for a little fun. - I told the police and those Feds everything. I swear I don't know anything please, I swear. - You sure you're not lying to me? - No, I told them everything. - I believe you, I do. Yeah. Really, that's it. No excitement? My God! I mean, you just converted me to a believer and you're not even happy with your accomplishment. Yeah, breathe, breathe. Let it go, let it go brother. That's my fault, it's just habit, you know symmetry. But I think it's better this way. Balance of pain, spread it out a bit. - Screw you, asshole. - I'm trying to help you Louie, I am trying to help you here. - The hell with you! - I understand, I understand your anger. I relate to you. - You're crazy. - True enough, that I am, I'm gonna let you go. If you could help me with one more thing I need. I want you to look like you've been shot in the head. Now you're free, Louie. - With all the construction going on around here, this is where they put you? - You should be in New York, cleaning up your mess. - I had a meeting in town with a senator. - Glad you got the time. - Well, my team's on the site. The owner of the car said the vehicle was stolen. - You used an assault helicopter. - which tracks, because we traced the source of the surge to an apartment owned by a millennial... - Automatic weapon fire on public streets. - You should get back in the field, Ray, shit happens, We're cleaning it up. And I thought I'd bring you a kind of an apology, it's a very fine bourbon, it's rather expensive. - Do you buy it by the case? - Actually I do, I find that it helps grease the rails of inter-agency cooperation. - You wanna taste? - No actually I'd rather have a scotch. - so you gonna tell me about this kid? - Car thief, pizza delivery guy, a loser, We'll get him. - So other than the senator, what are you doing here? - Well, I wanted to talk to you about Thomas Hawks. - Romans bearing gifts. - I don't understand why you're getting in the way with me on this, I'm playing nice. But, you know, I don't have to we don't serve the same masters. - Sy, Hawks came to us before he went to you. He saw through you, discovered what you planned for it. So he runs, he doesn't trust anyone. Now, we have a gigantic mess because, neither of us could get him to prevent it. - You know that's quite the story. I mean, the way you tell it, and it almost sounds like, you're the "nice guy". - So you're "goody two shoes" in this situation? - No, no, it's just that I realized a long time ago, they're no such things as "good guys". I'm the smart one, a patriot. This device is safeguard, and incredible power to breach and extract anything. - There are too many variables. This thing should have been destroyed immediately never even considered for funding. - You know I remembered you as being a lot more fun. - We will wipe it out, all evidence of it, everything. - You sure about that? Do you believe that's the best solution? - It is the only solution. - Thanks for the drink. - Oh, one more thing. You did bring Brink into this. You didn't think we'd find out? - Actually, I don't care. - You should, the man's sloppy, landed commercially at JFK a few hours ago. He is supposed to be a ghost? - He is a ghost, but he makes public appearances when the Devil's too busy or I ask him to. - What do we think? - Nothing new, he's fishing If he had anything more, I would have heard about it. - Well, with Brink involved, things are gonna get worse before they get better. - Maybe we will catch a break. - Graham, what do you really think of him? Sy? - Yes. - Sy is a dangerous egomaniac who will stop at nothing to get the device. So, how did it go? - The man is a scared pacifist bureaucrat in a dangerous world. - It's gone. - How's that possible? - I don't know. Is that a thing, self-erasing text messages? - Let me see. - Should I even have this on, can't they track us? - Uh, you ask me like I've done this hundreds of times. - I'm ditching the phone. - Wait, what if whoever that was tries to contact you again? - Okay, then just put it in airplane mode and turn it off for now. - I'm really starting to regret being the teleporter's chosen one. - It's okay, relax Kate. Everything's under control, I got this. - You could've checked the gas before you stole it. - Well, next time you steal a car, you can do that. - Why am I HERE? - You know, I never thought about that. - No, I'm just talking out loud. - No I mean, really, why you? Why did it take me to that place? - Well, we'd be able to figure that out, if the person who invented it wasn't dead. - There's gotta be some way to figure this out. - What are you doing? - Google. - Actually at this point, why not? - Yeah, if they track us, they track us but, if we can use this thing they won't be able to. - Anything? - I don't know, lot's of stuff about "Star Trek". I just got a text; 'beware of the blonde in black'. What is this? - Dane, they're totally tracking your phone. Ooh shit! - Go, go, go! - We want that device! - Oh, my God! We totally did it. - Hell yeah, we did! - Okay, we're only in a parking lot. - No, I think we're gonna be okay. - We can do this, I'm not that far from home. - Yeah, we just need to find out how to get the rest of the way without using this thing, it's completely random that it brought us here. - Isn't this like a goldmine for you or something? - Any requests? - Shut it off before you toss it. - I broke yours, so you should do the honors. - I guess that's it for perfectly timed mystery texts. - Does this Jeep have a GPS or anything? - No but, you make a good point, we should do our best to stay off the grid until we're ready to make our next move. - Yeah, what is our next move? - Well we have the device, they show up we'll use it to zap from wherever we are to wherever it takes us. - Is that really your plan? We're just supposed to randomly zap around? - Only as last resort, I don't think we should we zapping anymore either. - Why? - I think they're able to track that somehow too. - Whoa, whoa! Careful! Are you planning on driving us off this cliff? - This is amazing. Never been in the Grand Canyon before. - Me either, it's beautiful. - So if you could zap anywhere in the world, where would you zap to? - Fifth grade. - That's time travel dummy that doesn't count. - Oh, yeah, right. I'd say Hawaii? - Lame. - What? - I'm sure everyone would say Hawaii. - Okay, so then where would you zap to if you could just zap anywhere? - Not so sure, I'm not doing that right now. - It's getting dark even if we could make it back to your place in Arizona by tomorrow, They could be waiting for us. - Did you see all the camping gear back there? I mean, maybe we should just camp somewhere for the night, somewhere safe and off the grid. - That's actually kind of perfect. - So let's get this straight Sy, with all your resources, plus the psycho you thought to include, the pizza boy and the checkout girl have eluded you once again. - Ray, Come on, I've been trying to explain to you we will get the device, but all you're complaining about is collateral damage while I'm attempting to have my team act with restraint, even Brink. - Cut the bullshit Sy, Where do we stand right now? - The teams are on their way to the site of the latest surge in Utah. Their cell phone signal went dead in approximately the same location, we believe that they teleported there and we're not even sure if they understand how the axcellerator works. - Nobody understands how it works and you certainly don't, you don't even get how dangerous this thing is in the right hands, if we controlled it, under the best circumstances. - Oh I understand. - No, no, you don't, that's it Sy, You're done. - Pull your people, I'm sending ours in. This has become a certified disaster. - My people are on their way. It's more efficient if they follow through at this point. - You blew it Sy, that's why I'm getting in your way. Because, I am not gonna risk civilization with this thing falling into the wrong hands. Namely yours! - Are you okay, Ray? - Jesus! - You sound all, worked up? - You treacherous son of a bitch... - You should really go easy on that hard stuff, my friend... it's a killer. You know that man, he can't hold his liquor. - What was in that bottle? - Odorless, colorless, tasteless, and untraceable. Waste of a good bottle of bourbon really. - Why aren't you on a plane to Utah? - I have no idea where the device is, but I know where it's going to be. - Really? - Really, I'll need Graham to call her media friends. - Look what I found! - Excellent, give me one. - Wait a second, let's see what we got. Beef Stroganoff with noodles, breakfast skillet, beef jerky? - Ooo, an appetizer, perfect. - This feels so surreal after what we've been through. Somehow camping in the middle of the desert with a stolen car, it almost feels normal. - Yeah, it feels good, Right? - Right. - So, besides the fact that you work at Val-Mart. - Worked at Val-Mart. - Your dog is at the vet. - My best friend. - And you're from Arizona. - Unfortunately. - What you do? - I have no idea what I want to do or, what I'm doing. - Yeah, I can certainly relate to that. - After I went to Arizona State, I couldn't get a job, I was buried in student loans. And my parents can't even afford the trailer they live in so, I just had to take whatever job I could. - What was your major? - Art history. - I'm sorry, yeah, cause, that's really good training for, not any career. - Yeah, now they tell me. - Don't be too hard on yourself, all I do is deliver pizza. - Following in the family business would've been a bad option I guess. - And I'm just now realizing that I'm officially late for work... again. - Well, now we're both unemployed. - To unemployment. - Better than bowing down to the man. - More time for video games. - It's funny, right? Two of us somehow finding each other. - All of a sudden being lost but in ways we never expected. It's amazing how they all look the same. What time do they open? - They're always open. - What's the plan exactly? - Dane! I got this. - Shit, this is gonna be good. - So my stupid boyfriend decides to buy a TV that doesn't even fit into our apartment. - Well, the Val-Mart return policy on electronics is only 15 days and you need a valid sales receipt. - Really? Let me see if I have it. Thank God! - Do you want this back on your credit card? - No, actually I left my credit card at home, but if I can just do a cash refund that would be great. - As many in the country begin to think twice about their own personal internet security, New York City and federal authorities continue to believe the torture and execution of New Yorker Louis Moretti was the work of internet killers Dane Holloway and his girlfriend Kate Dalton. Holloway and Dalton photographed the victim after shooting him multiple times and posted it on social media with a warning that more murders would follow. Particularly chilling was the way Mr. Holloway lured Louis Moretti by using social media. The motive for the brutal killing is still unknown. Holloway and Dalton escaped from authorities in a destructive high speed chase. Unconfirmed reports place them on the run to Utah or Arizona where Miss Dalton had resided. If seen use extreme caution, do not approach and contact authorities immediately. The two are considered to be armed and highly dangerous... - Dane wait! - Louie was the only person I had left. - I'm sorry. - I'm going back. - You have to calm down, you can't just go back there without a plan or because you're upset. - What difference does that make? The whole country's after us now. - Yes, but let's just think for a second... - They killed Louis! - I'm really sorry. - We can't hide in the desert forever. - Yes but let's make the smart move here. - They just made it for me, I'm going back. - God this is crazy. - Are you coming or not? I'll see you around. Thank you. - We're in this together. - Oh no! - Wait, isn't this? - Louis apartment. They wanted us to come here. - Okay love birds, looks like someone heard what I did to their friend and they're not happy. - Oh my goodness! - Oh God! No get away from me! No stop, get away from me, please! - Come on Dane, whatta ya say, huh?! Come here. Oh yes, look at that, little precious! Gotcha! - Goodbye asshole. - You might as well give that to me. We've got your girl and she's long gone to Iron Mountain. - It's what they want! - We're in this together... - I'm going back... - long gone to Iron Mountain... - You just have to trust me... - We're in this together... - I'm going back... - Do you wish you were there? - to Iron Mountain... - We're in this together... - I should have told you, be in motion on your feet before takeoff, it helps with the landing. - What is this? - I know it must be confusing. - Confusing? What the hell is happening? - You seem more high strung than I remember. - Don't worry you're not dead. - I'm not worried that I'm dead you're dead. That's what worries me. - That would worry me too if that were the case. - Watch your head. - It is the case, you died. The SUV exploded, it was all over the news. - Yes, the SUV did explode and had I stayed inside, I most certainly would have died but, by some mistake, some portal opening, teleportation error of the gods so to speak, I was thrown into the backyard of my childhood home. - What? - It may have been residual psykinetic energy. I'm not certain. - Why didn't you try and find me? People have been trying to kill me for the last two days. - Well, there is only one axcellerator and a prototype at that, besides you and that girl have been surging so frequently it's been hard to get a signal. - Kate, her name is Kate and you know, she thought that this would... Kate! They took... Iron Mountain. - What did you say... - Iron Mountain, they have her, Kate. They took her to whatever that is, do you know it? - Yes, Sy knows it as well. It's in Santiago, Chile. - Chile? Why would they take her there? - It's the mountain, the physical makeup, the iron core components that make up it's center... It affects the axcellerator, it'll never work. - Can we use it to get there though? - Well, could be possible but, you broke it. - You should have made it like a suit or something. - Well, thanks for the design input I'll keep that in mind. - Look, we have to get there and save Kate. - Sy has a substantial armed black ops team under his control. If he goes to Iron Mountain, it's likely he's expecting us. - Was it you sending me those disappearing text messages helping us escape? - Text messages? - Those came from me. - Who are you? How did you find this place? - I can find most anything I want. - Who are you? - My name is Amanda Graham. I'm a member of a private global peacekeeping organization and not the United Nations, they don't keep peace anywhere. You don't really need to know more than that. - Because if we did, you'd have to kill us, right? - We've been discreetly monitoring the abilities of the axcellerator along with several government agencies who are funding it. Sy wants the device for war, greed, money, power. The NSA wants to destroy it. - What do you want? - I want to use it for good to help this planet. But, now that Sy has gone rogue, I want him also. - I just want help Kate. - Good, our interests may align. If you're prepared to go further. - How do I know we can trust you? - You're standing in a laboratory of a man you assumed was dead after spending several days... - Teleporting from place to place blah, blah, I know I get it. - Good, then you'll understand that you can't trust anything. - She makes a good point. - Have you been to Chile, Kate? - Iron Mountain, it's actually a lovely resort, good skiing, but not today. - Why bring me here? I have nothing to do with this. - You know Kate, I'm sorry. I have to apologize, I know it's difficult being leverage. But, your boyfriend Dane, he's going to bring the axcellerator to me because of you, then I'll be through with the both of you. - Do you enjoy being such a sadistic asshole? - Yes, I do. - All right, our teams are in place, on standby. - Everything ours, power, telecom, wireless? - Everything. - What about the locals? - Oh, that was the easy part, once you make your reservation, our team will clear the summit. - Well let's get this party started. - With pleasure. - Take a good look, Kate, we're in the Andes. Nowhere to go even if you wanted to. - Okay Brink, make us a reservation, you know how I hate crowds. - Everyone evacuated, summit secured. - Access slopes are secured. - Jesus! - I didn't mean to invent this. - I'm not giving up without a fight. - Dane, I know you've survived thus far, and your instincts are excellent, but these are real killers, bad men especially Sy, you need to stick to the plan. - He's got no reason not to kill both of us regardless. - You give him the dummy device, you radio us that you've got her and get out, understood? - I didn't have anything to lose before but things have changed, understood. - What am I supposed to do? - You stay here with the real device and get it working. - You know what you're big mistake was Kate? You should have stayed on the run, but you came back. Why? - Because someone needed me and I care about him. And I care about not acting like a coward or trying to control things like a coward. - You know something Kate, with all your talk, all your mettle, if I placed this right here, we'll see. You will shake like a coward like everybody else. You shaking Kate? Sit up. - Sir, the gondola has been restarted and the kid is on board. - Of course. - How you doing Dane? - I'm all right, a little nervous. - Well, that's understandable. - Not about the whole hostage rescue thing or shadow agency criminals, I'm just not really the biggest fan of heights. - This is not right. - We're gonna work to get you back down as quickly and safely as possible. - Much appreciated. Also, if there's any type of monetary reward for you know, saving the world or keeping a top secret experiment secret that too would be greatly appreciated. - I'll see what I can do. - Sorry pal, he only gets it when I get the girl. Hey, Kate. - Dane! - Hello Dane. - Kate is quite a handful, is she worth it? I mean, after all you've been through? If I can speak, man to man. - You'd have to actually be a man to do that. - Looks like two of you are perfect for each other. - Let her go. - Hang on, how many people are with you? - No one. - Well, how did you find us? - Because I can't use the device here because of the mountain. - You're smarter than I thought. - Yeah, quick Google search on the mountain, it's obvious why you would have chosen this place. So I couldn't use the device against you. It's common sense, really. - Well, maybe it's common sense that at a certain altitude, let's say at the top of this mountain, in this very restaurant, far enough away from the mountain's deposit that it might work. - Well, if I had known that I could have saved a lot of the frequent flyer miles I cashed in to get here. - Are we gonna do this? - All right, let's say you came here alone, and you brought me the device. I suppose that I could just have Brink shoot you both now. - Take it. - Empty. - What is he doing? - You said I was smarter than you thought. - This kid is gonna give me a heart attack. - Okay, genius. Where is it? - You release Kate, when she's safely down the mountain the device will come to you. - No, Dane! - Kate, it's gonna be fine. - I like it. That kind of makes it, sort of exciting, huh Brink? Get her out of here. - No! - Don't worry, I'll take good care of her. - There she goes... So let's have it. - Useless! - Set the timer for five minutes then give me the trigger. Well honey, I don't think you're gonna quite make it to the bottom, but we are going to send you bombing down this hill. - Oh no! - Up here, somebody help me? Somebody help me! - Clever. - So, how does it work? - Are you really looking at me to explain that? - See this detonator? Attached to the bottom of Kate's gondola... C4. It's a messy way to go. - And I have set the timer. - For how long? - Five minutes. - Ooooo... That's tight. - Move the teams NOW! Go, get the chopper up there! - Come on kid, you're wasting time. - Okay, okay, I can kind of, sort of explain it. - Well then kinda, sorta, do it. - All right. It's based off the intention of the subconscious. It takes you to place with pure intent. - You expect me to believe that? - Does anyone? Look it's how I got home, it's why it took me to her. It takes you to what you want most what in your subconscious you need. - You know, that would have been a nice moment that you could have shared with Kate, before I killed you both. - It's okay, Sy, I never expected to make it out of here alive anyway. - Get out there. Break out the big stuff. It's time to get messy. - Shoot him. - And blow up the girl. - Why don't you try it first Sy? - Why doesn't it work? - That would have been a nice moment for you just zapping out of here like that. - What did you do with it? - Nothing, I swear. - The interesting thing about my job is when you lie as much as I do, you can tell when someone else is not telling the truth, without a doubt. - Fiddlesticks! - Shoot him. - Hi Sy! - Hawks? - No, wait. - Subject has escaped wearing a red skit jacket, damn it! Get him now, bring him to me NOW! - Hey, dickhead! Hey, hey, hey, HEY, I'm down here! Holy shit! Okay... - Oh, shit! - Okay, think, think, what do I do? - That's him! Stop him! - Please, somebody help me! Shit! Oh God - Oh shit! - Help me, please up here! Please, somebody help me! - Jesus Christ! Sorry asshole. - Dane! - Kate! Kate! - Dane, up here! - There's a bomb, there's a bomb on board. - Yeah, NO SHIT! Do something! - Hang on I'm coming! - What are doing? - Heights, I shouldn't have said anything with my luck. - Oh, Dane what the hell are you doing? - Dane, Dane please hurry! Dane! Dane? Dane, it's gonna fall. - Oh God, I think my leg is broken. - What? Oh, let me see. - Oh shit, look! - Yeah I'm looking, I just can't see... - No, no, NO Look, look, LOOK! - I gotcha now. - Oh shit! Oh shit! - This is gonna be so nice for me, all right. - Ha, Ha, HA! Yeah! - You have to leave me! - Time to chop up my problems... - Lets go! You see me, don't ya? What ya got? Owwww! That's a good one Kate, That's... goooood... - A knife? Hey, where did you get that knife? - Camping supplies, Remember? - Where did learn to throw like that? - You kids had enough fun for one day? - You're alive! - Yep. - Where are we? - The geographic center of the Sahara Desert, 3.5 million square miles of sand and a new distance record for the axcellerator, actually. - Why? - To rid the world of evil like you promised me Sy. - No, no wait. - Good luck Sy. - Wait a minute. - Goodbye. - Wait a minute! Hawks! Hawks! - Now don't forget you need to feed him once in the morning and once in the evening and take him on at least two walks. - And no more teleport experiments, that freaks him out. - That was a one-time thing because of the squirrel. - Maybe I should have left him at the vet again. - I love animals and they're fond of me as well. It's people I can't understand. - Can we all focus here for a moment? You two sure you're really up for this? A live run, a field test? - It would have been a little difficult to return to delivering pizzas - Or bagging groceries. - I have given Tomas free run of this laboratory. I'm really excited to see what you've come up with, Where are there new devices? - They're wearing them. - Wearing them? - Yeah, he took some pretty solid design advice. - Oh, you're the Versace of teleportation design. - That was actually pretty good. - Oh my God, Why did I leave planetary security in the hands of three jokers? Can we? - Yes. Are we ready? - If you want me you'll find me. - Yep, she knows how to keep things interesting. ♪ Every day, every day ♪ ♪ Start panicking, turn into a mannequin ♪ ♪ Take a breath now, ahh, begin again ♪ ♪ Open your eyes please ♪ ♪ Turn your smile on ♪ ♪ Realign with now as well ♪ ♪ You start freaking out ♪ ♪ Wishing you were peaking out ♪ ♪ Hold it together now ♪ ♪ Instead of leaking out ♪ ♪ Turn your smile on ♪ ♪ Turn your smile up bright ♪ ♪ Remember the days when your laughter was meant ♪ ♪ Remember the days when you did what you said ♪ ♪ You're counting the days til you get high again ♪ ♪ Chill out, be easy on yourself ♪ ♪ Every day, every day ♪ ♪ You stop choosing it ♪ ♪ Suddenly you're losing it ♪ ♪ Give it a kiss now ♪ ♪ Instead of bruising it ♪ ♪ More than a mean fear ♪ ♪ Pieces whole here ♪ ♪ Let the past go boys and girl ♪ ♪ You start stressing out ♪ ♪ Time to learn a lesson, doubts ♪ ♪ Not in your jeans, so please stop your guessing bout ♪ ♪ Turn your smile on ♪ ♪ Turn your smile up bright ♪ ♪ Remember the days when your laughter was meant ♪ ♪ Remember the days when you did what you said ♪ ♪ You're counting the days til you get high again ♪ ♪ Chill out, be easy on yourself ♪ ♪ Easy on yourself ♪ ♪ Every day, every day ♪ ♪ Every day in 50 million ways ♪ ♪ I like to play with each cell of your brain ♪ ♪ I call and say Yo Hello Hooray ♪ ♪ I'd like to wake up a moment from your smile ♪ ♪ Remember the days when your laughter was meant ♪ ♪ Remember the days when you did what you said ♪ ♪ You're counting the days til you get high again ♪ ♪ Chill out, be easy on yourself till then ♪ ♪ Every day in 50 million ways ♪ ♪ I like to play with each cell of your brain ♪ ♪ I call and say Yo Hello Hooray ♪ ♪ I'd like to wake up a moment from your smile ♪ ♪ Every day in 50 million ways ♪
