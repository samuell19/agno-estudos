FIXES-SYNC by VaVooM For this week's video post, we should explore exercise hacks you can do at your desk... how to get your heart rate going even while you're on the clock. It might be time to update the blog with a few more healthy recipes for women on the go. And let's think about adding a podcast segment for ways we can look and feel more put together, even when we're always running out the door. It is 8:00 a.m. Your order is ready. Morning. Your new order-ahead app is my new best friend. Tipped you there. - Good morning! - Morning, Chels. Are the latest numbers in? Yes. The brand's had another great week. Our follower count's up on the blog, vlog, and podcast. And we've had over 5,000 unique downloads just from this morning. I bet it's that blog that went viral about doing your laundry right? "What you can accomplish with a bag of quarters, no Wi-Fi, and a vending machine." Sadie, remind me to look into self-folding laundry. I will remind you. Or your human assistant could just remind you as well. Okay. So, we've got our staff meeting at 9:00 a.m., and then we've got a mini-meditation at 9:45. Okay. At 10:30, I've got content review, and then I have you answering your follower questions between 11:30 and 12:00, which gives you just enough time to grab a smoothie right before we put you in the cab for your big meeting with Barbara. I can't believe it's finally happening, Chelsea. Me and Barbara Davrow, in the same room, breathing the same air. I mean, she's the leading self-help expert for women of our time. I want to make sure that I bring in some new ideas, just in case she asks me what I'm working on... although, I kind of hope the only thing that we'll be talking about is her speaking tour for the fall. And how you're gonna be one of her stars? Lauren! You're a shoo-in! You just got written up by the New York Banner. You're more than just a brand about saving time now... you're an influencer. Did you know three of her speakers from last year's tour landed major book deals, and one even got a talk show? I can see it all now... The 27-Hour Day Cookbook, The 27-Hour Day skincare line, a-a-athletic wear! A... Lauren... ...a partnership with a cruise line. I think maybe we should just see how the meeting goes first. Right. I love your enthusiasm, though. Your coffee! Thank you! We'll use birch for the new guest rooms and bathrooms, and poplar for the pavilion underneath. All locally sourced, as stipulated. Once you sign off, we'll start ordering materials, arranging for permits. We think we'll be done right before spring. That's beautiful. Perfect, in fact. Dad's blueprints finally coming to life. All right, Mom. Why don't you sign? We're all signing this. This expansion and this whole place belongs to all three of us. We've put in the work over 15 years. It's not just gonna be my name on it. All right. That does it, then. Congratulations, West family. Your retreat is about to double in size. All right! I'm glad we're getting it done. Yeah, I gotta get back to the guests... watercolor class. And I have a pile of bills with my name on it. Which leaves me to update our marketing material... but first, I gotta fix the kitchen sink. Oh, and, honey, can you take the cookies out when the timer dings? Although, you might want to just... ...A minute or two before? I got you, Mom. Here we go, Dad. Come on, Poppy. Let's go. We got a sink to fix. Self-help is an industry that is constantly evolving for women. There are more and more tools at our disposal... apps on your phone, Zoom groups, different kinds of bubble bath. Yeah. But what is actually helping us get what we want? And where we want? Exactly. How can we become the women we are meant to be? You know, Lauren, I am absolutely taken with your brand. You are accessible, encouraging... and you are always creating new content. I'm 100% committed to helping women find ways to save time, because it helps us do more. Why have 24 hours when you can have 27? Yes, exactly. Now, I am looking for female leaders who can share about their path to strength, power, and innovation, and can guide our audiences on their own journeys to being their best. Well, I would love to join you in that mission, Barbara. It will be very demanding, but be very rewarding, too. Tell me this. What have you done with all this... time that you've saved? I put it right back into the brand. I use it to keep doing more. Because, like you say, we should pursue what we love, and not let anything slow us down. Which is not to say that we should never slow down. When is the last time that you took a day off for self-care? Even an afternoon? I had a teeth cleaning last week. Yeah, it was a... it was a really nice break. Although I did use it to brush up on some conversational French. It was one of those learn-a-language apps. I have a folder for them on my phone... Yes. Lauren, you are very passionate, and that's wonderful, but I also know how easy it is to, well, lose yourself in the business and forget about work/life balance. Burnout. We can't be at our best and help somebody else become their mightiest, if we aren't. Well, all due respect, but I believe that I am at my best when I'm... Apologies for interrupting. Your car service will be here shortly. Thank you. So this is where we must say our goodbyes. I am about to head off to my summer house to rest, recharge, and, well, get some of that work/life balance back. Okay. I-I-I just want to assure you that I am not burnt out. Not even close. I'll tell you what. Why don't we circle back on this in a few weeks? And maybe between now and then, you'll have had some time to put yourself first. - Nice to meet you. - Y-Yeah. Thank you so much. It's an honor. She wants me to have "balance." I think she thinks that all I do is work, and I don't have anything going on outside of it. What? Of course you do! You... Actually, you are always working. I know! I think I really blew my chance for the spot on the tour. And now she's going away for vacation, to recharge, and-and who knows if she's even gonna remember me when she gets back? Maybe you should recharge, too? Right, yeah. Just walk away. Wait! Disconnecting from work could be a really good idea. And besides, we-we have tons of content ready to launch for next week. Now might be the perfect time for you to step away. Okay. I hear you. I will carve out some time this weekend and spend an hour... maybe half an hour... reflecting. Lauren, I think you're gonna need a little more time than that. What? Okay, listen. Why don't I just put together a few ideas? You know, some fun ways to get a few days out of the city, you know, get at that balance that Barbara's talking about. Oh, Sadie... remind me to look into power-napping. I don't think we've covered that on the podcast yet, have we? I will remind you. Oh, boy. What? It is 7:00 p.m. Call your mom. Sadie, call Mom. Let me guess. You got your hair mask in, dishwasher's running, and dinner's in the oven? Well... you're not too far off. - How are you? - I'm good. I put the marigolds in today. Oh, honey, I can't wait for you to get to Connecticut, see what I got going on in the yard. I'm becoming quite the gardener in my retirement. Hey! How's work? Didn't you have that big meeting today? I did. It went... great. I hope Barbara and I will stay in touch. She's... She's a fan of the brand. Who isn't? Now, I know it hasn't been easy, building your company... all these years of hard work and sacrifices, but I think it's paying off, honey. Well, Mom, I'm just following your example. You always managed to do it all. I don't know about that. It's just really nice to hear your voice. It's nice to hear yours, too, sweetie. Thanks for calling me. Love you! Love you. It is midnight. Time to post your entry. "Balance." Reminder... prep lunch for tomorrow and unload dishwasher. You have spin class in five hours. Good timing, Chelsea. "Peace Soul Spa." Yoga sounds good. "Meadowlawn Retreat." Montana. "Book." So you'll add in that piece about consolidating office supplies? I want to look into cross promoting that with a major supplier, okay? Can you please get back to that coffee company about the quick-drip pods? Yeah. Copy me on the email. Never mind. No. I'm not going to have access to email. What? Chelsea? - Hello? - The signal starts to cut out right around here. Right. Okay, well, I think I tied up everything I needed to. At least... I hope I did. There you go. Perfect! Great shot! - Thank you! - Nice start. Did you remember to unplug the toaster? Yes. And the humidifier and the coffee pot. And you're sure your folks have the number here? They're not gonna need to call us, because the kids are gonna be fine. As long as they don't let them eat their weight in candy bars. Welcome! And you are...? - Lauren. - Lauren! Ah, yes. What brings you to Meadowlawn, Lauren? Well, I just decided I needed a break from work. You know, just get back some of that balance. You'll find it easy to disconnect here. Putting technology aside makes a huge difference. That, and not having clocks. I'm sorry. You don't have clocks? We encourage guests to rise when they like, sleep when they're tired, eat when they're hungry. Basically, get in touch with their internal clocks. We do use bells, if there's a gathering. Bells? We have outdoor and crafting activities every morning, and free time in the afternoons. Kitchen is always open, although we do eat as a group for dinner every night. Take time to share, get to know each other. Reflect. Yes! Yes. I can't wait to jump right into all of that. Okay, if you're ready, I'll go ahead and store your gadgets. Great! Yes. Okay. I only brought a few things because I knew this would be happening, so. Okay. And... And... And... there. Okay. And your... Yes. And... Okay. Soon, you won't even miss these. All right. You're gonna be in the Pine Room. Upstairs, last door at the end of the hall. Kyle will put your bags in there for you. Let us know if there is anything we can do to make you more comfortable. Thank you. Okay. Thanks. They're safe. Don't worry. I got it. It's okay. Laundry day? More like laundry week, now that Ayla's on cooking duty with Mom. What brings you by, Doc? I had a house call around the corner... the Boones' dog swallowed some of the grandkids' sidewalk chalk. He's fine now. I thought I'd drop a few treats off for Poppy. What's that? And I found a pig. Way to bury the lede, Paul! She's got a little infection on her hoof, but I got it cleared up, but she's gonna need to be rehabbed for a bit before she's fit to adopt. Well, you know you can rehab her here. A pig? When you're all about to start construction? I think your mom might kill me, Jack. You know, your dad almost did... all those summers you helped out around the office, and nearly brought home a zoo. Mom wouldn't be able to resist that face. Well, we do have a few rescues around the house right now, and Tilly might be glad for the reprieve. All right, well, bring her on out. We'll treat her like one of the guests. Sadie, please look up beginner knitting patterns for... I'm off the grid. Okay. Reading! Yep. Reading... is a nice normal vacation activity. Okay... "Chapter one." Chapter one... No. Okay. On this very special episode of The 27-Hour Day, I'm calculating how many laps it will take me to get to my daily quota of 10,000 steps. No gadgets, no pen and paper... just a little mental math and a beautiful day, stretching out in front of me. Yeah, okay, stop-stop-stop! What, here? Yeah. Okay, okay, Marybeth? Hello? Can you hear me? Can you hear me? Hello? I said I can do the Kempers' wedding. Mother of the bride's a real handful, but she's my kind of handful, if you know what I mean. Can you hear the birds, Marybeth? Sounds like my meditation app. It's only a week, Lauren. Only a week. The fourth's time a charm. One... two, three... Go! Go get it! Go get it! Oink. Come on. You need some gentle exercise. It's gonna be good for your foot. Oink. All right. Take five. Workaholic New Yorker, 12:00. - Hey, there. - Hi. I didn't realize there was an animal component to this retreat. Guess they're gonna help us be one with nature, or learn how to meditate. No. There's not really an... animal, element, technically, but you're more than welcome to hang out with them... zero meditation required. Hi. I'm Jack, by the way. I'm one of the owners here. If you have any questions while you're here... I'm Lauren. Hi. - Hi. - Nice to mee... Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you, too. If you're looking for some trails, there's some really nice ones down this way. You just keep following the path. And, you know, areas for relaxing, quiet contemplation. Sort of working my way up to contemplation. First vacation in a while? Yeah, well, first vacation ever, actually. Any advice for getting acclimated? Not really used to having nothing to do. Yeah. Sure. Breathe. "Breathe"? That's helpful. You're welcome. - Great. - Breathe. - Gonna work on that. - Great. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you. Well... she's gonna need some time to adjust. Come on. You ready now? Okay, there we go! Hello, everybody. Welcome. We usually go around, introduce ourselves. I think you all know me and my sister, Ayla, my mom, Sally. Who'd like to go first? I'll go. I'm Lauren, and I have only asked my smart watch to do three things today, so... I'm doing great. I don't really like sitting still, so here's hoping I can embrace unplugging. I am Diane, and I am here with my husband, Mike. We have three kids, we work at the same law firm, and, lately, we have been texting each other more than actually speaking, so we're here to try to talk more. And relax. Something Diane has not always been very good at, but I, on the other hand... well, you'll see. Hi, everyone. I'm Heather. I'm an event planner in Charleston. I've coordinated 112 weddings this year... a record for my company... but I also snoozed through part of a rehearsal dinner last week, so... I'm here to rest up and craft. I love to craft. I'm Roger. I'm recently retired, which I'm still getting used to saying. I've been in the house for the last three months and I can't for the life of me figure out what to do next. So this is a break from my break. It's so good to have you all here, and you've picked a perfect week to come... our annual "Honey Fest" is next Saturday night, and everyone's invited to attend. There's a ton of bee kitsch... ...but it really is top-notch. These here are journals... for jotting down any thoughts you're having about being here, or being away from your regular routines. They are just for you. Thanks. Okay. Okay. I hope I'm not disturbing you? No, not at all. Since you mentioned you do a podcast, I thought maybe this would be a good alternative to journaling. You can record any thoughts you have on that, if you like. That's so nice of you, but... isn't this technology against the rules? I think we can make an exception. Thanks! Okay. Hi there. This is Lauren from The 27-Hour Day, and I'm coming to you from Springfield, Montana, where I am taking a vacation that I haven't scheduled down to the hour, or turned into a strategically-planned long weekend. No. I'm... actually in the middle of a forest... ...totally disconnected. And I'm kinda scared. All right, all right. Here we are. Okay. Yes! No. What are you looking at? If it's so easy, why don't you try? That's what I thought. Exactly. Good morning. Hey. Morning. No weights this morning? Nope. Just taking a quite stroll, as part of my leisurely morning. Leisurely, huh? Well, I heard somebody else up at 5:30 a.m. I'm guessing it wasn't you? Okay, so, I maybe did a yoga routine when I first woke up. And then I tried to knit a little, then I wrote a few postcards that I picked up at the airport, but it was all very relaxing! It's exactly what I wanted to do for the last few hours. Sounds like it. You know, if you add a little duct tape to the end of that, it'll grab the light faster. Helpful hints are kind of my thing. Let's see if this is gonna work. Imagine if this works. 'Kay, it works. I had the best sleep of my life last night... no kids, no alarm clock. I only woke up once, thinking I'd forgotten to put in the silverware count for the Semples' wedding, but they got married ages ago, so. Is anyone else hearing emails come in, and then forgetting that you have no way to check them? Totally! Is it terrible that I miss that sound? Not as terrible as missing your bridezillas. I've been doing this long enough, I seem to speak their language. Leave it to me to ruin my new dress. - No. - Don't worry. I'm an expert in stains. When we get back to the house, I have a hack for you. "Have a..." Lauren? Are you Lauren Garrett? Yes. Oh, my god. It's Lauren Garrett. The 27-Hour Day! I love your podcast. Your tips have helped me so much as an event planner, you have no idea. Her episodes, they are all about saving time, multi-tasking, and making the most of a few minutes. I'm a devoted listener! I'm so glad my advice has been helpful. I mean, that's why I do what I do. Sounds like I need to start listening. Do you ever run out of ideas? Not yet. Lauren. You are one prolific berry-picker. Is this too many? No, no, no. Pick as many as you want. Although there aren't any awards at the end. Just lots of pie. Hey, guys, there's some more over there. Okay. Yeah. Tell me more. Ask her all the questions and she has all the answers. Slow down, Lauren. I want to keep exploring this concept of relaxation. Maybe put that gorgeous tub in my room to good use. How about you, Lauren? Any plans this afternoon? I haven't decided what I'm gonna do, actually. Well, it's perfect weather to go out on the lake. That is, if that's something you want to do. Contractor confirmed for 2:00 today. We are gonna need to up our advertising in the fall. This place needs to be at full capacity when they construction's done. Even with the backing of our investors, I think we're gonna need full-time help once this is done, not just here and there. If we hire more staff, it will require more money. I'm trying to stretch every dollar of this investment. Which we should be. But if we're overwhelmed, we won't be a good example for our guests. Let's start with part-time. We'll make it happen. Let's not worry. Deal? Deal. Are you trying to find time to explore the great outdoors, and do some pleasure reading? Well, I have a hack for you. Lock away your watch, find a canoe, and head out into the water, with your new title. Today, I'm paddling with " Running the World and Not Sorry About It... Today's Top Female Entrepreneurs." Join me. What? No! How did I even do that? No! Okay. You got a hack for canoeing without a paddle? I do not. But if you'd given me a few more minutes, I assure you that I would have. This is what I get for losing myself in a good book. You don't want to just leave me out here, to teach me a lesson about quiet contemplation? You know, I thought about it... but you might get sunburned. Yeah. That must be a pretty engrossing book. It is, it's about the habits of highly-successful female entrepreneurs. There must be a chapter about making time to relax? You know, I haven't gotten to that yet. Well, you're in for a treat. Does it bother you that I like to get things done? No. Not at all. I just hope you're doing things because you like them, and not just to cross them off your list. Don't get too caught up in that book, all right? We're having something really good for dinner. And in proximity to the creek, do you think it would be okay... Sorry, guys. One second. ...plant a vegetable garden, around here? Yeah! You could have a nice little... Lowell. Hey! So, you're gonna send me those signed copies of the agreement? Listen, pal. I'm really sorry. Our deal isn't exactly closed. What do you mean it's not closed? I thought the deal was done. I mean, we're starting construction over here. This other property's come up that the partners are interested in. Any way you can come in, give a presentation this Thursday? Yeah. Yeah, no. Of course. That's great, Jack. I'll see you Thursday. So, we like to ask a question before dinner, just to learn more about each other. There are no wrong answers here. Are you sure about that? There's no judgment, I promise. If you had an afternoon to do anything, what would it be? Drink coffee in Paris. Watch a bluegrass concert. Go on a safari. Play soccer with our kids. - Get a pedicure. - What? Okay, I changed mine. Mike and I have a picnic... just the two of us. Mine's easy. I go to a craft show, early entry. I'd take an architectural tour, explore part of a city I've never seen. There are so many things I could do with a free afternoon. I would go visit my mom... and we'd just sit on the porch and talk. It's been a long time since I've done that. That's a nice answer. Not true! Okay, maybe sometimes. Nice move, Mom! Hey there. Hi. Board games not your thing, either? Not really. I take it you'd rather knit? Oh, this? No. This is just a ruse. I'm about to use these needles to break into the tech safe, check my email, read a few articles I bookmarked about speedy blenders. Well, I'm about to go do this thing that I think you might like, too. Which is? Come with me. Hammocks? This is your coveted activity? Don't knock it till you try it. Take your pick. I pick that one. Okay. Okay, this is actually pretty great. Just sink in and look at the stars. You thought I went right to sleep, didn't you? You do look 8% more relaxed than when you got here. What? Only 8%? There's still a few more days to work on it. I should go check on the pig. 'Kay. Hey, Jack? Thanks. Now, I know we only have one morning for this, not months and months, but that is also the beauty of this activity... ...to capture whatever you see in the moment. You can be abstract... ...or more realistic. You can use all the colors, or just one. Truly, it's whatever speaks to you. Lauren... Is everything all right? I'm really not trying to be an assembly line, I promise. I just... I can't get the picture how I want it. Well, you don't have to include every part of the scene, unless you want to. Maybe start smaller? Okay. Do you have any more brushes? Yes, Diane. Okay. I'm just going to paint the tree. Just giving the tree its moment. So I have the yellow potentillas along this side, and those rows of willows your mom wanted for shade. Might need to dial things back a little bit. Can we do the willows in a second wave, do these sections in increments? Sure, I can reorganize the estimate. Is everything okay? Yeah. No, everything's great. Although, maybe we can keep these plans between you and me for the time being? As long as there's no dirt on opening day, we will be golden. Absolutely. And I'm sure Hugh West wouldn't have stood for that. Yeah. You were gonna be a doctor, weren't you? A vet, actually. I did my first year of grad school at Cornell, then Dad got sick, I came back home. Mom wasn't in great shape, Ayla was still in high school. It was supposed to be temporary. Well, I have to hand it to you, after all these years, you're all still in business. And, you're still expanding... like your dad wanted. I know he'd really be proud. Yeah. That's the hope. Roger, that's lovely. Thank you. I've never painted before, but I really enjoyed it. You said you recently retired. What did you do before? I was an investment banker for 30 years, up until my company got bought out. So, you didn't exactly choose to retire? I thought about going somewhere else, but I worked so hard for so long, I figured maybe I should retire. Start playing golf, traveling... things I always meant to do. But I haven't done any of those things. When you put so much of yourself into your job, and then it's gone, you feel a little lost. Lauren Garrett, founder of The 27-Hour Day, was recently seen throwing her knitting needles into a closet after realizing she doesn't actually like to knit. Yes, I am talking to myself. Hello. Squeak, squeak. Hey there. - Hi! - Hey. I realized I didn't ask you what its name is. She doesn't have one yet. If I name the animals, it's harder to let them go. And besides, some kid's just gonna name her "Marshmallow" or "Bubble Gum." She's a guest here, just like me. Just here until her little hoof gets better, and she's ready to adopt. You interested? Well... my super might have a problem with it, considering there are no pets allowed in my building, but I don't know, she's pretty cute. She is. Do you want to give fetch another go with me? Sure. Yeah. Yeah? Okay. Go get it. Go get it! Try it again. Hey! Yes, yes. I think she's getting it. I think she is! You seem like an animal person. - Me? - Yeah. No! No, I don't have the right energy for animals. I'm not patient enough. You are with her. Well, what about you? You have a heavy animal-whisperer vibe going on. Well, I like animals around. I think you're a nurturer. You like to help others. I prefer "heavy animal-whisperer." Lauren! Lauren! I found a couple hammocks! Do you want to check them out, gossip about celebrity weddings with me? Sure. Yes! Come on! I'll leave you two to some quality alone time. Hi. Hey. That hammock is pretty good, huh? It's pretty nice. My mom wanted to wake you up, but I figured you could use the rest. - Wh... - There you go. Thank you! Do you always load the dishwasher that way? Maybe. Why? It's exactly how I load the dishwasher and even a bit little "Type A." I just didn't expect that from you. I am totally chill, okay? I just like things done a certain way. So maybe we're a little more similar than we thought. Well, I looked up your website, and you're an expert in efficiency. I am. Since I was 12 years old. You've been this way since you were 12? Yeah, pretty much. After my dad passed away, my mom had to go back to work, then she was going to school at night, so, seemed like, all of a sudden, there was so much to do, and not enough time to do it, so I started looking for little ways I could help... you know, setting the table before I went bed, filling the coffee pot, timing chores to last exactly the length of a load of laundry. So you really needed that nap. You know what? I think I'm gonna dig into my secret ice-cream stash. I might even be in the mood for sharing, even though you mocked my dishwasher technique. I wasn't mocking, I was admiring. And thank you, but I'm not the type of person who hones in on someone else's secret ice-cream stash. Huckleberry with pie pieces. It's a Montana specialty. Dessert for dinner? I can get behind that. You know, I actually have a hack... ...Hack for this? Never mind. I mean, it's not like we're in a hurry anyway. No, we're not. Oh, my... ...give it here. Yeah, take it. - Okay. - But don't really take it. It's my ice cream. It's gone. I've taken it. It's too late for you. Good morning. Good morning. Is that going to be here? Yeah. Yeah, we got four new guest cottages, and a pavilion for events. Jack has a last-minute presentation for our investors and wanted a visual, so I told him I'd mock up a model. Well, it looks fantastic. Thank you. Kyle already had to run out and get more glue. Have you two been together long? Yeah, just the last couple years. But we've known each other since high school. Once he started working for us, we just kind of fell into things. What about you? Are you seeing anyone? My dating life is pretty much non-existent. Turns out that asking a guy to go grocery shopping together is not a recipe for romance. Sounds like Jack, who is actually allergic to dating. Really? Yeah. Yeah, he's decided he's married to the retreat, no matter how much Mom and I push him to give a relationship a chance. He's stubborn like that. Yeah. I mean, not that I know him well or anything, it's just... I could see that. Look at the... little wheelbarrow you put over here, yeah. What made you decide to come out here, Lauren? I know it must have been hard for you to take a break. Well, actually, I had a meeting with Barbara Davrow. Barbara Davrow? - The Barbara Dav...? - Yes. Tell me! I was really hoping that she would invite me to join her speaking tour this fall... ...but, instead, she thought that I needed to work on my "balance," and not make everything all about work. Yeah. So here I am. It's so hard, isn't it? Giving our careers anything less than 150% can make us seem like we're not invested enough. Of course, it's easy to forget about the rest of life waiting for us. I have two little nieces that I adore I haven't seen in... a year? I know we both love what we do, but I think a reset was in order. Now can you tell me everything about Barbara Davrow? - Start from the beginning. - Hi, guys. Hi! - We got some cheese! - And crackers! No! Go on, get out of here! What is it? I must have kept the gate to the pen open. The pig knocked the table over, and turned this into a fun obstacle course. I can't tell Ayla this got ruined. She did it up for me so fast. I have the meeting tomorrow morning. I can help you fix it. No, Lauren. Seriously. I can put things together in half the time it should normally take. It's literally my area of expertise. You're a guest here. You're supposed to be reflecting, not doing damage control. If I do any more reflecting, I'm gonna turn into a mirror. Put my "Type A" tendencies to work. Okay. I gratefully accept. Where do we start? Breathe. Almost perfect. The roof on that one is still a little crooked, so just don't let anyone get too close. You hear that? Stay outta here. So, your meeting's tomorrow morning? Yeah. Yeah, it's just a... kind of formality with the Helena investors. Well, good luck. Thank you. Hey, do you, do want to grab a... a drink with me, just as a "thank you"? I think I could fit that in. It's from a batch that Ayla and Kyle made last summer. How very artisanal. There's probably a reason why it was stored in the barn. So sorry! I didn't want to say anything. No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - It's terrible. - Terrible. Did you grow up here? On the property, I mean? Yeah, since Ayla was born. The four of us, we would go hiking, camping, swimming in the lake. My dad, he worked a pretty stressful sales job. He retired early after a health scare. He convinced my mom to turn this place into a retreat, where people could come unwind, slow down... take advantage of how beautiful it is. It's just a shame that he only got to experience it for about a year before he passed. He had big plans for this place. So... now his mission falls to you? Yeah. I've definitely been carrying on Dad's dream. Sometimes, I can't remember what... what's his vision, and what's mine. Well, your dad was definitely onto something, I mean, I know I've gotten a lot from my days here. Oh, yeah? Like helping me salvage a 3-D model? Yes. I'm getting to know myself again and... ...for that, I could not be more grateful. A toast... to your dad. And to the future of the retreat... may you dazzle your investors tomorrow. To Dad... and all the people that came through because of him... may none of them drink this wine. Cheers to that. Cheers to that! Can't remember if it's Tuesday or Wednesday, and... I don't really mind. I'm developing real friendships here, including one with Jack. All these feelings are coming up. I haven't felt them in a long time. This... quiet, stillness... it's making me more open, more perceptive. More alive. And I think I want the rest of my life to feel like this. Hi! You're doing so good! Now... Now are we racing? Okay, let's go. Afternoon! Hi! Looks like she's ready for her big photo shoot. She sure is! I'm Tilly. My husband and I own the veterinary practice in town. Hi! I'm Lauren. I'm a guest here for the week. How are you enjoying Meadowlawn? I love it. It's so special here, and, plus, it's been amazing getting to know the Wests. They're dear friends of ours. We've known the kids since they were tiny. You know, Jack used to follow my husband around at the office before he could tie his shoes. You know, for a while, we thought he might even join the practice. Really? How do you mean? His folks wanted him to finish vet school, but Jack came home when Hugh got sick, and he jumped into the business without hesitation. I guess that's how life goes sometimes. Right. I came to get pictures of her for her adoption flyer! Of course. There you go. That's a very sporting little sash! Come with Tilly. Jack. Hey. You're gonna nail this, buddy. That's the plan. Everyone remember Jack West? From Meadowlawn? Thank you. Hi, everybody. If you could open your packets... let's get started. Be still my heart. You know, I never stopped for samples before. It's kind of a game-changer. Hold the phone. Is that quilting fabric over there? If you're not back in 10, I'm coming after you. Hey, Jack! How are you, buddy? - Good. How are you? - Good, good, good. Lauren! Hey. Hey! You look nice. Thank you. How was your meeting? It was great. Ended up ending early, so I thought I'd join you guys in the kitchen. Really? What? I'm actually a pretty good cook. No, I believe you, I'm just gonna have to try to keep up with you. I'll try not to leave you behind. That's perfect. You are. Those brownies are gonna be amazing. Thank you. How's it going over there? It's going well. Good. Didn't realize this was a race. It's not. I'm just choosing not to spend quality time with every single tomato. Hey-hey-hey-hey-hey! I'm just gonna help you out, just a little bit, so we can finish before ski season. You're welcome to copy my technique, if you want. It's okay. I prefer measured and precise. - Thank you very much. - That's so weird. I prefer a normal human speed, so... All right, everybody. Break time. You mean "leave the kitchen"? A watched pot never boils. Besides, we need some fresh air. You're thinking about cleaning up. No. And how much time you could save? Well, I just... I just have a few suggestions, that's all. Walk away. Let's go have some fun. Yeah. Okay. Okay! Okay, everybody! Pretty easy game. Don't be intimidated by my skill level. This is gonna be a fierce game. Oh, you. You... go, go, go, go, go. Okay. You're a tough act to follow, Jack, but I'll give it a shot. Okay. Not bad, honey! Yeah, not bad. We got a challenger, people! Look at that curve. I saw that. Yeah, she's been practicing. A little form here. Looks like I have some stiff competition. Okay, okay. - All right. - Okay. Now, remember what I did... and don't do that. Okay. Is that chirping a phone? No, no, no, no, no! No, no. Nope! Oh, boy! Oh, my goodness! Open! Don't look! All that butter gone... We must not have heard the timer go off. You guys? I'm sure we can whip up a replacement with stuff we already have here. Quick-and-easy potluck recipes do happen to be one of my specialties. Yeah? Let's get started. So, all we needed was the peanut butter, a little sugar, milk, butter, a bit of cornstarch... and... chocolate chips... And voila, we have chocolate-peanut butter pudding. No. It has to chill first and... Oh, my goodness. That is delicious. Right? No. No. It has to sit in the fridge for one hour. Patience is a virtue. - Okay. - Here, let me get that for you. Okay. - Sorry. - I'm sorry. Well, I think a "thanks" is in order, to the West family, for making all of this happen, and to Lauren, for your quick-and-easy dessert save! Hear, hear! - Cheers. - Cheers. This is some fine cooking. Are these all family recipes? Yeah, something like that. And a few we've picked up along the way. Hey, is the recipe for this pudding still on your blog, Lauren? It's actually my mom's recipe. Although she didn't make it to save time... she just had good ideas. I can send it to you? That would be great. Di and I are gonna make it with the kids. Yeah. You okay? Sure. Yeah. It's a... pig. Jack? Hon'? We can see you now. Here we go! Let's do this. You all break ground on the new addition? Soon. Although, we're still waiting to hear from the investors, to see if the deal's officially closed. Turns out it's between us and some huge resort in Billings... which we should keep between us, until I get an answer. We'll be keeping our fingers crossed. Thanks. And this little lady is good to go. I'll even do her first check-up for free, whoever adopts her. That's great. We're thinking about announcing the adoption tomorrow at The Honey Fest. There's gonna be a lot of families there, so. Perfect. We'll see you then. Okay. Thanks, Doc. Look at that. Yeah, that was easy, huh? Tilly, could you give Floyd a call before the next patient, and ask him to come in another day next week? I'll try. Thanks again for your help on this one, Jack. Of course. I thought Floyd retired? He did. Come on. Marisa moved an hour away. Paul's so busy, he's been begging them to come in for a day here or there, but what we really need is another vet. It wasn't so long ago we thought we'd have you. That was a million years ago. Well, you don't forget when somebody finishes at the top of their class in animal sciences. I guess I should be glad someone remembers. Thanks for getting us in early, okay? Always. - Guitar, huh? - Mm-hmm. Yeah. I was in a cover band in college, so if you want to harmonize later, I'm your guy. - Sure! - Yeah. FYI... I didn't marry him for his musical talent. Okay! First camping trip? Not by a long shot. You are looking at Junebug Camp's "Camper of the Week," three summers running. My counselor was particularly impressed by how well I rolled up my sleeping bag. Surprising. Have a good time! Thanks, Mom. You too. Almost there. Great spot, huh? It was my dad's favorite. Okay! Why don't the guys get the tents set up, I'll get the cook station going, and, ladies, you can grab us some kindling? I did a forest-themed wedding last year, and I can pick up sticks like it's nobody's business. We are on it! All right, fellas. Guess we should set up right here. All right. My kids would be so proud of me right now. I'm so proud of myself. I'm a long way from my corner office. And I'm really proud of Jack, who usually stays at home to work during these camping trips. We've got a good group this week. Yeah, we do. They're all great. Yeah, I haven't seen you smile so much in, like, forever. Well, you know, it's because things are moving forward with the expansion. Or maybe it's because you're actually letting yourself like someone? I know you don't go out with anyone past a third date because you think it'll take away from the retreat. But look at me, huh? Even I found time for a relationship. Ayla, I appreciate your concern, but my dating life is just fine. What's so funny? It's not "fine"! What do you mean, it's not... Hey, guys. Besides... Lauren lives in New York. You do know there's such a thing as long distance, right? - I do know that. - I'm just saying. You're "just saying"? - Yeah. - Yeah? - I love you. - Love you! Yeah, baby! I'll clean up and I'll see you after. Okay. I'll help you. You know, Jack here was the star of our local musical. - Really? - Please. You really have a good voice. Thank you. I think I'm gonna turn in. - All right. - See you in the morning. - See you in the morning. - Goodnight. 'Night. You know, you and your mom and Ayla should have a podcast. I don't think so. No, I'm serious. You could talk about all the ways you help people unplug, and you'd be promoting the retreat at the same time. Well, we wouldn't want to give away all of our secrets. Besides, you have to come here to actually get what it is we're doing. You're right. I mean, all of the burned-out big-city, workaholic guests like me, they really have to be here to experience it. You're not like the other guests. I'm serious. We've had hundreds. Never anyone quite like you. And definitely no one as excited as I am about a pet pig. I don't usually come on these camping trips. I don't usually like slowing down. Well, maybe I'm a bad influence. Or exactly what I need. Lowell. We good to go? Listen, Jack, I got some bad news. We're not moving forward with the project. What? - Seriously? - We're gonna go forward with the large project in Billings. No. I get it. Yeah, it's the sure thing. - I just couldn't convince 'em. - All right. Thanks for the call. Was that the contractor? No, that's Mr. Rodriguez. Landscaping talk. Well, why don't you get cleaned up and we'll go over those floor samples? Give me a minute, okay? How're we doing? It's interesting, Jack. I'm in a real pickle, huh? It's not the worst pickle I've ever seen. I'd say your option is to take out a pretty substantial business loan, which would mean delaying your construction. And of course, you'd have to get approved. Or? See if you have the cash lying around anywhere else. I know. Look at this place! We have to get some "beeware" for the kids, honey. Only if you and I get some, too. Done! Let's do it. I know those are calling to you. I only have so much room in my suitcase, but maybe they can ship. Happy Honey Fest, everyone! It's a Springfield tradition close to my family's heart, and as some of you might know, my dad, Hugh, helped organize this event almost 30 years ago. It's amazing to see how much it's grown every year since. Before I forget, with her efforts to raise money for the animal shelter, go see Tilly Ladd and buy some of her beeswax candles before she sells out! Now for the real reason why I'm up here. This little pig here is up for adoption. She loves people, eating, napping, even playing fetch. She's... curious, so she's gonna need a little bit of supervision, but she's really sweet. If anybody wants to adopt her, come talk to me, because we're trying to find her a good home. And now, I'm gonna give up the mic to my sister, Ayla West... ...who's gonna join the band on guitar! You having a good time? Well, I have bought gifts for everyone in my office. I have eaten my weight in fudge. I prevented Heather from buying a suitcase full of bee-themed votives. So, yes, I'm having a great time. Well, it's your last day. You have to eat all the fudge, right? - Right. - Yeah. Excuse me? Yes? Can we talk to you about the pig? I know someone who's very interested. 'Kay! - I'll be back, okay? - Okay. Yeah, guys. Hey there. Hey! Everything settled with the pig? Yes. They're gonna pick her up tomorrow. Do they have a name picked out yet? I have a strong feeling it's gonna be "Honey." Of course. You want to dance? I tend to prefer more structured dancing... you know, like "The Electric Slide." Just meet me in the middle. See? It's not that bad. It's not bad at all. I want to ask you a question. Yeah. Barbara? I'm sorry. I'll be... I'll be right back. Okay. Yes, so, my summer house is 20 miles north from here. I come down to Honey Fest every summer. I think it's quite interesting how paths cross so unexpectedly. Seeing you here now, it's like a decade has passed since our meeting in New York. You had a good week? It's been invaluable. I have had a chance to breathe. I finally understand what you meant by balance. I've gotten to know myself again. And that person is...? Someone who always wants to help, even if my intentions come across as a little pushy sometimes. It turns out I am really not into knitting. Imagine if you had had two weeks, how much more you would know yourself. I have to say, I am really glad that it was a meaningful experience for you. And I'm also very surprised that you took my words... to find "you time"... so seriously. Very impressive. Honestly, I can't wait to get back home and see what this "new life" looks like. Tell you what. Why don't you give me a call when you're settled in New York? We can talk about the tour. That's my direct line. Yes. Of course. I would love that. All right. You enjoy the festival. You too. I didn't know you knew the great Barbara Davrow as well. I can't believe you know Barbara Davrow personally. Yeah, she's kind of like our mega-famous neighbor that shows up every summer to buy honey. No big deal. I think she's gonna ask me to join her speaking tour this fall. Really? It would be a huge step for my brand... just a launching pad for my career. That's amazing. It would also mean going back to work at 300%... delaying all of these changes I want to make in my life, and missing my mom's 70th birthday. But it's what I've been working towards for... forever. Seems like you have a tough decision to make. I will... if she actually asks, because now there's the Lauren I was, and there's the Lauren I want to be. I should never have showed you that hammock. Hey, Jack. Have you ever thought about going back to vet school? What? No. Tilly mentioned it... how you went and then came back. You stayed to help. I mean... makes a lot of sense. That was a decision I chose to leave behind a long time ago. I understand the pressure to help, the sense of duty. I don't know if you do, Lauren. Of course I do! I as the kid who made it my mission in life to help my mom. I know you were that kid, too. All I'm saying is just look at your mom and Ayla now. They're strong, they're capable. Okay. What if I did want to be a vet? I'm closer to 40 than I am 20. I'd have to start completely over. Maybe that's not such a bad thing. We're about to double the size of the retreat. We're barely gonna be able to juggle it all, and, what, I'm just supposed to walk away? I have to be accountable here. Can't just write a blog post about it. Lauren. Look. I know I've been measuring my life by checklists. I just don't want to see yours pass you by. - Hi. - Hi... Come on, Poppy. Come on. Come on. Can't believe it's over. I can't believe it either. Yikes. I forgot all about this. Sadie! You have 1,457 messages. I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. Well, yeah, it was really nice to meet you. Yeah. Don't be a stranger, okay? I want updates outside of the podcast. - Yes. - Yes? Okay. - Me too. - Yes! - Promise? - I promise. We'll be in touch. Good luck with your business, and getting back into things. Thank you so much, Roger, and I hope you find your next chapter. Bye! Okay. Got those. You be a good little girl. You were right. Easier that she doesn't have a name. I'm sorry. I-I put you on the spot last night. I appreciate what you said. If I'm being honest, a piece of me wonders... "What if?" But this place, this work... it's my life. You sound like me when I first got here. I hope you'll be happy. - Bye. - Bye. Lauren? Have a safe trip. Okay? You be on your best behavior. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Bye-bye. I know it's hard for you when the rescues leave, honey. You know what? That piggy's gonna be just fine. I know about the investment deal, Jack. The VP from Helena called me personally to apologize about the agreement falling through. Why didn't you tell me? Because I didn't want to worry you. I want to take care of this place and I want to take care of... Take care of me and Ayla? What is it that you want... for yourself? This is Barbara. Hi, Barbara. It's Lauren Garrett. I've been thinking a lot about our conversation last night, and... I feel like I need to be completely honest with you. Lauren! Welcome back! How was your trip? I want to hear everything. Somebody went antique shopping. This was a gift, actually. I made a recording almost every night I was away, and I thought that, by listening to some of them, it might help me plan out my goals for the week... and moving forward. Barbara Davrow offered me a spot on her speaking tour. I turned it down. Wait! What? I turned it down. I'd thought long and hard about what I would say if she offered it to me, so, when we talked last night, I had to tell her that I couldn't sign on because it would mean making sacrifices that I'm not willing to make. So you mean we're not gonna have a makeup line? This past week changed how I want to present the brand. Honestly, it changed how I want to live my life. Oh, please don't tell me we're moving to Montana to start a yoga studio. I just got an apartment with a dishwasher. We are not moving to Montana. And we're not starting a yoga studio. But... we are gonna make some big changes. Even if it means starting over, and even if our followers don't like it. Even if we lose some of them? Or... all of them? Yes. I am willing to take that risk. You know what? Whatever happens... ...you're not gonna lose me. You're the best. I know! Thanks so much. Hi, Mom. Am I dreaming? My daughter visiting unannounced on a weekday? It's so good to see you. Hope it's okay that I just showed up without calling? Are you kidding? Come on in. I'll put a cup of tea on and everything. Do you have any cookies? Is that my shortbread recipe? It sure is. I love it because they're fast, you can freeze them, and they're ready, on a moment's notice, in case of company. Hey, Mom? I wanted to come here today to say thank you... for working so hard and doing so much when I was little. Oh, honey. You don't have to thank me for that. I do. You were like a superhero. You... You juggled so many demands and you never complained. I think I pushed myself so hard all of these years because I thought that if I slowed down, or I didn't do enough, that I wouldn't live up to your example. Oh... honey. You could never disappoint me. Never. Come on. Come here. Yes. Get that! Good girl. Hi, everyone. It's Lauren. This is an unusual episode of The 27-Hour Day. I'm not gonna give you advice for saving time today. Well... not exactly. You see, I've spent more than 20 years becoming an expert in efficiency. I wanted to have a time-saving tip for every chore, every recipe, every exercise... but now I see that we shouldn't always be trying to do things faster, just to do twice as much. So, with that in mind, I am rebranding The 27-Hour Day. I'm gonna teach myself, and hopefully you, too, how to save time not just for what's efficient, but for what's really important. So, I'll still help you find the makeup products that will speed up your morning, but now it's because I want you to have more leisurely hours to spend with your friends. I'll help you fold your laundry faster so that you can have a laughter-filled dinner with your family... ...adjust your daily routine to fit in that newfound hobby, that makes you feel alive. Because, in trying to help you save time, I may have made you miss out on things that could have brought you joy or comfort or fulfillment... ...and for that, I am so sorry. I recently realized that, although my life was full of activity, there was nothing that really mattered to my heart... like... to really look at the stars, or noticing how even a small smile from someone can stay with you long after they're gone. Or appreciating how even strangers can become a family. From now on, I want to live every moment. We only have so much time, which is our most precious commodity, so we have to use it now and use it well. I hope you'll join me. All right. - Yeah? - Yeah. Exciting. All set? Yeah, we're officially scaled down. The pavilion will be up and running in the spring, and open for events. No new guest rooms. At least, for now. I know your dad dreamed about this expansion, but he'd be happy we're doing what's right for us. And he also would want you to have this. It's Dad's. Yes, it is. I can't. Yes, you can. I am excited for you. I'm nervous. Well, then I'll be excited for the both of us. We are gonna be okay. I know you'll be. Thank you. Hello? Lauren! Did I wake you up? Sorry. I'm so used to your Friday morning spin classes, but I guess those are ancient history now. A-a-anyways! I got our numbers back from last week, and they are high. I think we're keeping our audience. And there's a bunch of interest from other advertisers! Really? Yeah, some of them are even talking about partnerships. There's a dog food company, some "sound bath" place in Florida... you know what? We'll talk about it when you come in. But no rush. That's my new catchphrase. Do you like it? I love it. Did you get to the part about relaxing yet? No, but... I'm kind of a leisurely reader. Leisurely, huh? What are you doing here? Well, I am on my way to the interview at Cornell for the vet school. Figured I'd come by and say hello first, and... ...maybe go the zoo. Your assistant thought I might find you here. Vet school, huh? Well, that is, if they accept me. I'd still have to retake my first-year classes, 'cause it's been a minute, you know. And what about the retreat? Well, we've... cut back on the expansion quite a bit. Kyle's working full-time now, and... I think I might've found my replacement. It turns out I know this financial expert who's looking for his next chapter, and my mom convinced him to invest in a family-run business. - Roger? - Roger. You know, you were right... about school, about doing what I want while I still have the time. You were right, too. You should do things because they're truly meaningful, not just to say you've done them. Does this mean that I've inspired a new chapter of The 27-Hour Day? Well... I guess I could give you a little credit. "A little credit"? So... how far away is Cornell from here? I hear it's a quick flight... not a lot of time to get much done. I could work with that.
