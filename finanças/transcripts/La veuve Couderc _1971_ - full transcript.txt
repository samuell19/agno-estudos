Yes. My sister in-Iaw. There's a town in ItaIy with a Iot of these bridges. Where? In ItaIy. Are you ItaIian? No. I thought maybe you were, because Iots of men come up from ItaIy these days. They're here Iooking for work. I'm French. WiII you have some wine? Henri? Henri! Why don't you come when somebody caIIs you, instead of aIways sneaking around? Here, put this in the paddock and tend to the cows. This one is my brother-in-Iaw. He can't hear. He speaks onIy when he wants to. Isn't that right? That's PoIish, isn't it? My grandmother was PoIish. Are you Iooking for work? Yes. WeII, I have a IittIe, a coupIe of days' worth. You Iive here aIone with just your brother-in-Iaw? Yes, I'm a widow. My name's Yvette Couderc. What's your name? Jean. Then you're hired. I pay eight francs. Jean? This is my father's room. This is mine. We couId make up this room, but for the short time that you are here... It wouIdn't be worth it. Right. Here. You'II have to give me a IittIe heIp here. Open the door. Go to sIeep. Open up. No! What wouId the neighbors say if you died from it? I don't care about those fooIs. Open up! It's not true! You're afraid of them! You're the one who's afraid! What wiII they say when they find out you took in a tramp? - What did you say? - I didn't say anything. Anyway, this is my house, isn't it? I've taken care of you pretty weII. Oh, yes, but you have to. No, I don't. Not anymore, Henri. Now, go on. Go to sIeep. Morning. You don't seem to say very much. And you? Oh, weII, I have nothing to say. Neither have I. Neither have I!

But I'm not going. They're aIways coming here. He's a good-for-nothing. WeII, I mean, he has no profession. He wouIdn't have a job if he wasn't a friend of the mayor. As for her, she's never been abIe to forgive me for marrying her brother. I was 14 when I came here as a servant. The oId man raped me, and the son got me pregnant. AII for nothing because the baby died. And after that, I waited on the mother. I took care of her tiII she died. Then I became my husband's nurse maid and now I'm his widow. Isn't that right? I took care of aII of you, didn't I? Nursed you, washed you, wiped you. Never a day's rest for me here. I washed the dishes and I cooked! I pIowed the Iand, took care of the Iivestock Isn't that right? I've every right to be here! It's my home now! Because I earned it with my sweat! Am I right? I don't know. WeII, I know it. Huh! Thanks. You work fast. You seem used to it. That's right. But you're no farmer, are you? No. TeII father to bring the cows in and feed them. AII right. They don't Iike you. Leave them aIone. It's because they don't know me. You going to stay here Iong? As Iong as there's work I...I don't know! Put the eggs in one by one. It hoIds 60. FiII the Iamp with fueI making certain that the wick is cooked. Then fiII up the water pan. Water pan, water pan. That's it. No, it's here. Make sure that at aII the times the Iamp remains Iit during incubation and... I think I'II go up to the attic so I can see it working. Right now? Yes. Time to go to bed, Father. The probIem is the number of eggs. UnIess we have a try with a dozen onIy. Oh, yes. But if it doesn't work right, I Iose a dozen eggs. We'II have to try, though. Who's the young girI who Iives over there? F?Iicie. She's their daughter. Good night. Good night. WeII, then, you're not in bed yet? No! I toId you no! Is it 'cause he's here? Don't be stupid, you fooI. Is it a boy? What did you name him? I don't know. It depends. That's right, go back over there! Go find some bargeman to sIeep with! Why were you so mean? Because she's a whore. Her son has no papa. Anyway, she's not sure. What's the difference? She seems to Iove the baby, right? She doesn't Iove anybody. Do you? You're not from around here, eh? No. You see, I think this board has sweIIed. What's your profession? I was going to be a doctor. What do you mean, ''was going to be''? Because I'm just out of prison. No, he...he won't hear you.

They have a chiId with coIic. What are you doing here? Turn out the Iight. I just wanted to say... It was awfuIIy mean of me, wasn't it? Eh? Yes. I'm not mad at her for fIirting, but.... ...but in my home, no. FIaunting that pretty figure. If I'm a IittIe jeaIous... ...you understand? Sure. You'II Iike it better here. You'II see. - And her? - Don't worry about her. Anyway, she'II have to go. Oh, when I think that she gave him her husband's cIothes! It's disgracefuI! And who knows what eIse she gave him. THE FRENCH ACTION Nobody knows who he is, where he's from, or anything. You know Papa's deaf. When he wants to be. Where you off to? I am going back. WiII you make him sit down? You stay here with us. TeII him if he doesn't sit down, I'II Iock him in the wooden shed. You're going to go with me to see the notary. Listen, Papa, you onIy have to sign a few papers, and she's out. No. You oId fooI, you! You're a fooI, too, Iike him! They're both onIy interested in one thing... just getting into bed with somebody and it doesn't matter who. They came and got him. And you did nothing. What did you want me to do? Shoot 'em?

Why have you shaved it? For a change. Too bad. It was pretty. Now, I'm going to go cut the grass...for the rabbits. It'II be Sunday tomorrow. What do you do around here on Sunday? Go dancing? Sometimes. Sometimes or often? Often. You aIways dance with the same guy? No. You mean you're fickIe? I don't know. And maybe not. Don't you Iike animaIs? - Yes. - WeII, why'd you do that? What did I teII you? These gentIemen want to see your papers. That's aII right with me. Born in Paris? That's what it says. What kind of work do you do? I'm working on farms and seeing the country. That sounds Iike vagrancy. Oh, come on, now. He's my empIoyee. And I have the right amount of money on me. Have some. Shaft's not big enough. The wick doesn't fit. - WeII, can you fix it or not? - ProbabIy not. We'II have to find another one the same exact size. Then throw it in the garbage. It'II be okay. Did you take that revoIver? Yes.
