[Man whistling] [Whip cracking] [Whistling] [Man grunting] Well, there she is. Tucson. Tucson ahead! Where? There. Oh. It ain't exactly pretty, is it? Protection from Indians. Yep. Sure feel good to stretch out in a hotel bed. Come on. What? [Laughing] [Man whistling] [Woman chattering] [Clucking] [Children chattering] [People chattering] Sure is nice to see some peaceful Indians. And them is Papago. Hate Apaches worse than I do. Oh, Lookee Yonder. The town's growin' all the time. [Men chattering] [Man whistling] Back home they'd have called that makin' a house out of mud pies. Yeah. What do they do with the hole when they're done? Well, they... Well, just leave it, I reckon. [Laughing] [Speaking Mexican] (Veteran) Boy, Lookee Yonder. Too lazy to make their own bricks. Fellas like them are destroyin' evidence of the only walled city in United States territory. Old-timers used the wall for fightin' off Indians? Yep. Built when all this belonged to Mexico. Whole town inside the walls, soldiers guardin' it day and night. Well, the way that wall looks now, I'd say Tucson's bust its britches. [Laughing] [Children chattering] [People chattering] Seems like that water would make you dirtier. Stay around here long enough, you'll wind up drinkin' it. I'll take a look at California first. *[Fiddle playing] Haircut, haircut and shave. (Man) Shave and a haircut. Haircut and shave. Well, here you are, the sweetest little city this side of a rat hole. Camp in the Plaza! [Men grunting] [Whip cracking] [Man whistling] [Whip cracking] [Men grunting] Sure is a tired-lookin' outfit, Grant. More restless people. Where do you say they're from, Pete? Judgin' by their rigs, I'd say no further east than Missouri. [Boy speaking Spanish] What's he sayin'? He wants to water your horse in the Plaza for 15 cents. Why, sure. [Speaking Spanish] He says you are a great man. My name's Grant Oury. Where you from? Missouri. Name's Peter Muncie. You guessed right, Pete. This is Estevan Ochoa, Pete Kitchen, and Bart Massey. Pleased to know you. Howdy. Looks like your outfit got whittled down some on the trail. Yep, we started out from Missouri with 45 people and 15 wagons, but the Indians took to pot-shootin'. Couple of brand new orphans in the outfit. Yeah, that's why there's always legroom in the west. Yep. Say, uh, what's a good hotel here? [All laughing] Sir, the hotels to be found in Tucson are neither good nor bad. They are non-existent. You mean there ain't one? (Oury) That's right. What's the trouble, Phoebe? Who's she? Phoebe Titus, the only American woman in Tucson. Think she's gonna need help? Offhand, knowin' Phoebe, I'd say no, but we'd better be sort of handy. [People chattering] *[Music playing] Stop that music. [Chattering stops] Timmins, Longstreet, stand up and reach. Now, listen. I've got no quarrel with anybody but these two here so the rest of you better clear out. [People murmuring] These might be in the way. Much obliged. (Phoebe) Some day this town will get tired of bein' kicked around by ward's men. It'll run the whole gang of you out of town. Till that happens, though, and as long as ward keeps braggin' there's no law around here, I'll settle thing's my own way. What's ailin' you now, Phoebe? These two playmates of yours stole $1,100 out of my house. I'm not sayin' you put them up to it, ward, but I'm here to get my money back. Right now. What do you say to that? Us? We did not. We never saw no $1,100 in our whole life. Then you'll wish you had. 'Cause there is gonna be 2 holes dug in the new cemetery that you'll just fit. You heard 'em, Phoebe. Have you got proof? Yeah, I heard 'em. Now if I don't start seein' my money I'm goin' to shoot. There'll be no killin' in my place. Since when? Since this mornin'? All right, put that money on the table or get ready to feel lead. You better do what the lady says. Count it, somebody. I'd like to oblige. Keep diggin', boys. I'll get this off my chest. Before I came to Tucson I never dreamed a place could stomach such off-scourin's and scum as you and your crowd. You wouldn't say that without these others backin' you up. I'm talkin' for myself. It's not enough that you charge twice what it's worth to haul freight into here, but you've collected the doggonedest bunch of lawbreakers in the whole territory of Arizona. Pardon the interruptin', but you're $225 short. Tell your banker to pay back what they lost. Everybody knows it's stolen money. All right, Joe. Timmins, take that whip and give Longstreet 5 of the best lashes you got in you. Longstreet, you do the same to him. And if either of you eases up, I'll make it 20. But you got your money back. Why don't you let us be, Ms. Phoebe? We didn't mean no harm. Get started. Maybe I got somethin' to say about what can be done in my own place. You better do what the lady says. (Phoebe) Get goin'. Ward, you've got an idea you run this town, so I'll set you right about one thing. I've got my livestock and a pie business to take care of. [Whip cracking] That don't leave me much time for chasin' thieves. [Whip cracking] Keep your men away from my place or I'll double-load this gun and blow a hole in you they could drive a team of mules through. Yeah? Now, listen here-- Longstreet! Give him as good as you got. [Whip cracking] (Timmins) Ouch! Here's your money, miss. Thanks. My name is-- Harder! [Whip cracking] (Timmins) Ah! Just got in to town a few minutes ago. My name's-- that's more like it. And remember I'm still keepin' my money in my house. Thanks, fellas. Well, do you still wonder whether she can take care of herself? Brother, there goes a female army. And after all that fine talk, she went and took my hat. Be with you in a minute. Trouble, Ms. Phoebe? No trouble. We've been waitin'. I've got to go to work. Any man that don't think the pies are worth waitin' for is free to leave. Everythin' is fine. I watch pies all the time you're gone. Thanks, Hilario. There will be a special pie for you in the next batch. Sorry to keep you waitin', but I had a little business to take care of. (Steve) Got a peach today? Yep, I got a peach right here. Mind the heat. Can I get one of them? You sure can. Take your pick, as soon as I see your dollar. It's the last one, quince. Much obliged, but I come to get my hat. Oh, it was you. Doggoned if I didn't walk right off with it. Be right back. Say, I never seed a woman pay less attention to me than you did in that saloon. Well, I had plenty on my mind. You're new here. Got in a little while ago. Help yourself to some pie. Come on in. How come you got yourself into my argument over at the saloon? Well, where I'm from, women is supposed to need protection. I'm obliged for the use of your hat, stranger, but I don't ask nor get favors for bein' what I was born. Yep, that's what I found out. Where you from? Freeport, Illinois. I'm from Saint Louis. What brought you here? My father and I were goin' to California. We got this far and he died. I see how it is. Livin' alone in a place like this, you couldn't afford to be a woman, unless you met the right man. Eat your pie. Anythin' left out of that last batch, Ms. Phoebe? They are all sold, judge. How long before the next batch? Oh, maybe an hour. Seems as though a newly elected justice of the peace ought to have some special rights. Who elected you? Oh, some of the boys. Hey, Joe Briggs. [Goats bleating] I got some time on my hands, Joe, and there's a charge against you. Might as well hold court out here where it don't smell so bad. Are you ready to stand trial? I ain't got much time. Can you hurry it up? Sure enough. Just step in a little more where it's shady. [Rooster crows] Now, prisoner at the bar, the charge against you is that you up and blowed the head plumb off of Gus Modesto, in consequence of which said shootin', said Gus is deader than blazes. Are you guilty or not guilty? No, judge, I don't reckon I can say not guilty when everybody seed me do it. Now, what in tunket made you act like that, Joe? Drinkin'. Just drinkin'. Well, the verdict of this here tribunal is that Joe Briggs is fined $5 for disturbin' the peace. Court is hereby adjourned to Lazarus ward's bar, where said fine will be duly disposed of. Some day, judge Bogardus, the law will come to Arizona, and half of you will be hung. Ms. Phoebe, you belittle us. Not half, 90%. Maybe the government forgot us now, arguin' about what should be free and what slave, but the time will come and when it does, this will be a territory to be proud of. Quite right. Quite right. A territory to be proud of. Meanwhile, Mr. Briggs, there is a fine to be paid. Any of you gentlemen that feel up to it may participate in the first round. I mean any one of you gentlemen. You got the $5, ain't you, Joe? Mighty nice talk you give. Probably won't do much good, though. Somebody has to tell 'em off, whether it helps or not. You're sure doin' a man's work around this town, ain't you? I keep busy. Do you wear them jeans all the time? Why? Well, I packed a banjo all the way from Saint Louis. Thought I might serenade you tonight, if you'd put on a dress. You'll serenade me the way I am. Uh, I mean, uh, I'll be busy tonight. Music's for idlers anyway. Thanks for the pie. Keep the oven hot. I don't want any serenadin', now. No serenadin'. Haircut? Shave? I could use a shave. Fix you up in a jiffy. You play a nice fiddle. I got a banjo. Finest fiddle in the west. I packed her 1,500 miles. She never done bust a string. Say, does Ms. Phoebe Titus live at her pie stand? Yes, sir. Fine girl, Ms. Phoebe. Figurin' on doin' a little courtin'? Maybe. Let's fix you up sweet then. Good close shave. Some vanilla extract on your hair. Yes, sir! Plenty of vanilla. Don't shave me too short. *[Banjo strumming] (Peter) * I dream of genie * with the light brown hair * born like a vapor * on the summer air * I see her tripping * where the bright streams play * * happy as the daisies * that danced on her way who is that? Do you want I should send him away? Ah, go on back to bed. Can't you hear? I'm bein' serenaded. * many were the blithe birds * that warbled them o're * oh, I dream of Jeanie * with the light brown hair * floatin' like a vapor * on the soft * summer air * was it good? Well, I don't know. I guess so, I've never been sung to before. *[Fiddle playing] You look kind of pretty standin' there. Lots different than you did in that saloon. I suppose it would please you more if I'd walk around town all day in my nightshirt. Oh, I think I could get used to them britches if I stayed around long enough. Oh. You figurin' on leavin'? Sometime. This Arizona territory is worth lookin' into for a man with ideas. Maybe if you studied it some you'd decide to stay. Might be I'd settle down, if I could get a job to suit me. You mean one with somethin' doin' all the time, to keep you on the move? Yeah. Say, how did you know that about me? Oh, the way you go pokin' into other people's troubles. The way you talk. The way you wear your hat. Well, you sort of took an interest in me. Yeah. Arizona could use fellas like you right now. Maybe somethin' will turn up. You sure are a calculatin' woman. I wouldn't say what I said if I didn't like you some. Much obliged. Same to you. Play some more music. Fancy or courtin'? Just music. * oh, kiss me quick and go my honey * * kiss me quick and go * to cheat surprise and prying eyes * * oh, kiss me quick and go * howdy, Johnny. (Johnny) Howdy, Ms. Phoebe. Morning, Solomon. Sorry I missed the commotion yesterday. It wasn't much. Gracias. Need some needles and another sack of flour for those gol-darned pies. Those gol-darned pies are makin' you a good livin'. Better ways than that to get ahead. How much are your needles? Quarter apiece. 25 cents? Why, you old Scotchman. What do you have to do, find them in a haystack? Well, you know the cost of haulin' over land. Especially when freightin' men like ward charge us twice what it's worth. What about Ochoa? He's bringin' in goods at fair prices. Well, he can't supply everybody. There's a business for you. Freightin'. Plenty of room for another honest outfit. Yeah, I reckon so. Well, how many needles you want? Two's plenty. Oh, Johnny, take a sack of flour over to Ms. Phoebe's right away. Wagons, oxen, mules, and plenty of good strong men that aren't afraid of hard work. Also Indians. That's part of livin' here. I own a wagon that's fit to haul anything anywhere, 4 horses, and I got enough money to buy oxen and another wagon. Solomon, I wouldn't be surprised to see myself in the freightin' business. Why, I thought you was aimin' to own the biggest cattle ranch in Arizona. That's right, and here's a better way of gettin' it than sellin' pies. You're forgettin' you'd be buckin' up against Lazarus ward. He don't like to play. Ochoa's doin' all right against him. Hmm. 2 wagons. You'd always have to be waitin' for somebody else's train to set out so as you could join for protection. 4 wagons would do the trick. 4 wagons could travel alone. I'll get along with 2. (Warner) Phoebe, you and me think lots alike. We both got confidence this country's gonna grow. Now, I didn't drive no mule teams across here with every cent I had without figurin' that more people are gonna be comin' here all the time. Bein' the man who opened the first store in Tucson, you ought to know which way the wind's blowin'. Phoebe, it looks like you got yourself a partner. Shake. Now, I'll put up money enough for 2 more wagons and some oxen. Then... Say, where are we gonna find a good man to head the outfit on the trail? They're darn scarce. Yeah. Leave it to me. I'll get him. See you later, partner. Got all day. Good morning, Mr. Muncie. Good morning. I was hopin' to buy a pie for breakfast, but you was out. Hello, Phoebe. Howdy. There's, uh, somethin' that might be worth talkin' about, Mr. Muncie. Yes, ma'am. Do you mind goin' someplace where it's not quite so noisy? Wherever you say. Somebody rob you again? No. I've been thinkin' about somethin' for quite a spell. I just settled it. You seem mighty pleased. Remember that job you were talkin' about last night the one with somethin' doin' all the time? Uh-huh. Well, it's waitin' for you, right now. What's that? Headin' a freightin' outfit on the trail for me. For you? Solomon Warner is my partner. He runs the big store here. Maybe I'm takin' a long chance decidin' you're the man for the job. But I'm a pretty good judge of people. Well, what do you say? Ms. Phoebe, I'm gonna tell you somethin' I'm afraid you won't understand. What's that? There's a wagon train come in headed for California and I'm joinin' up with it. When? Sundown. Well, sundown's a good time to leave. Indians don't hanker much for night fightin'. But why in tarnation do you want to go to California? I better not tell you. I'm askin' you, why? All right, I'm going to California because I want to see it. Well, I'll be doggoned! I figure it sounds kind of crazy to most people goin' to California just to see it. But there's a gallivantin' bug in my blood, and that's the way I am. Here I am offerin' you just the kind of job you said you wanted and you talk about travelin' 700 miles to go sightseein'. Well, it ain't that I don't want to work. But there's somethin' I got to do first. What can you do in California you can't do here? Lie down under a shade tree. Well, run me ragged. I'll be headin' back this way, though, when that gallivantin' fever goes out of me. Because I'm sort of fond of you. It doesn't matter to me whether you come back or not. Now, listen, don't act like that. We both know we're partial to each other. And the best thing I can do is get the wanderin' done while it won't do no harm. Will you be watchin' when we leave tonight? I don't know. Maybe, maybe not. There's only one more thing to be said. When I come back this way, it will probably be to settle down for good, and I'll be lookin' for you. We're leavin' from the Plaza. Well, I'll be dogged. *[Bugle blowing] Remember the name, Peter Muncie. Come back, Peter Muncie. [Clearing throat] Phoebe, there's crazy talk around town you're goin' into the freightin' business. There is nothin' crazy about it. Ward, some day Warner and I'll have a train that'll make yours look like a lop-wheeled shay. And people will be gettin' their goods at fair prices. Maybe. And maybe some day when you're runnin' the freightin' business, I'll be bakin' pretty pies. [Laughing] You got a lot to learn, Phoebe. [Laughing] Turn off to the feed store and start unloading. (Phoebe) Terry! (Terry) Yes, ma'am. The next 2 go to Warner's. Oye! You two go to Warner's. I got 4 barrels of salt fish for you, Sam, the best you can get. Fine. You're back early. Yeah. Terry. Yes, ma'am. Take care of meyer's and the restaurant. Have Steve unload at Hughes and send the last wagon over to my place. Yes, Ms. Phoebe. You see that, ward? 8 wagons top-heavy with freight. You'd better start bakin' those pies. [Laughing] Phoebe freightin' and telling you to bake pies. [Laughing] That sure would be comical, you bakin' pies. [Laughing] Yeah, wouldn't it? 2 days early. Phoebe, you're a wonder. No--no Indian trouble? Oh, we had a little brush with 10 Apaches, but they hightailed it before we could fire our second shots. Sol, I--I got real buy in Yuma. 8 of the fanciest cast-iron stoves you ever saw. Cast-iron stoves! Yeah. Phoebe, where in tarnation can we sell 8 stoves? There'll be women comin' in here, and women from the east want to do their cookin' in the house. In the next 5 years, I'll bet you sell-- sell 100 stoves. I'll live to be 90 and won't even sell 2 stoves. Well, what else did you get I didn't order? Oh, fancy bolt cloth, needles... Needles you can sell for 5 cents apiece. Phoebe, you're a caution. Sol, we're going to make more money than we ever dreamed of, and honest. And remember this. Soon as I get enough for my ranch I'm going to turn this whole business over to you, and I'm going to settle down to raise cattle and a family. You need a husband for that. I know where I can get one. Thing's are comin' our way fast, aren't they? Faster than we ever hoped. Well, that's usually the time to start pullin' in your belt. Ah, you talk like an old squaw. Yes, sir, thing's are breakin' just the way I want 'em. Say, what day of the month is this? 12th. April 12th. Message from Maj. Gen. Lynde, sir. At ease. Go to the mess hall. Tell them my orders are that you are to have anything you want to eat and drink. Thank you, sir. Oh, Lt. Chapin. Yes, sir. Well, here it is. War. Our orders are to abandon and destroy our post, to burn everything between the Colorado and the Rio grande that might be food for the rebels. "March out with your guns loaded and do not permit any citizen within 3 miles of your lines." There they go, the only law and order and protection we have known in the Arizona territory. (Oury) Who could believe that we would be cast aside by our own government? That wanton acts of destruction are bein' committed by soldiers to whom we look for security. At this very moment, gentlemen, we are bein' officially abandoned by the army of the United States of America. What grand reward for those of us who raised that flag in childish loyalty. [Crowd agreeing] Grain fields are bein' destroyed, livestock butchered, and by these traitorous acts the government has demonstrated that it considers us its own citizens, enemies, unworthy to live. (Man) You're right. [Crowd agreeing] (Man #2) Yes. Well, what are we going to do about it? Stay here and be massacred by the Apaches in a hopeless struggle to save what we have built? (Crowd) No, no! [People chattering] Mr. oury, am I hearin' right? Are you talkin' about givin' Arizona back to the Indians? That's one way of saying it, Phoebe. Like oury says, it's better to leave what we built here than get our bones picked clean by buzzards. What did you ever build? [Crowd laughing] Help me up there, Grant. Men, I know this hits all of us pretty hard. We all sort of figured the union troops might have to leave us to fight in the war back east. But we didn't want to think about it. So now it's happened. And the first thing you do is start hollerin' uncle. Why do you want to quit now? Ms. Phoebe, I'd follow you head-on into a barreled cactus, but there's some shenanigans that oughtn't to be did, like stayin' on here for one thing. (Scotty) Terry's right. We'd be fools to stay around here with the army gone. I'm leavin' tonight! [Crowd chattering] Gentlemen, may I have your attention. Gentlemen, a little courtesy, please. (Carteret) If you please, gentlemen, if you please. [Chattering stops] Thank you very much. I'd say, gentlemen, that this lady has made you look like a bunch of mice. [Crowd murmuring] Who are you to have an opinion? Jefferson carteret. You're quite fortunate that I just arrived by stage, because it's obvious that this town could use a little backbone right now. Much obliged, Mr. carteret. Men, we didn't come to Arizona for peace and quiet. We came here because it's in our blood to be where there's a hard life to be lived. We've always been that way. Why do you want to run out because the government has quit? I'm stayin', Phoebe. Here, here. I was never leavin'. I wasn't worried about you men, but what about all the rest of you out there? [Crowd murmuring] (Phoebe) Who's staying? All right, Ms. Phoebe, consider me swayed by the will of the people. Next election we have, you'll be swayed plenty. [Crowd laughing] (Phoebe) We'll stay, won't we? Sure, we'll all stay, and we'll get soldiers here to protect us. The union don't want us, but there's somebody does. Jeff Davis and the confederate states of America. [Crowd whooping] How about it? How about right here and now Arizona declaring its allegiance to the flag of the south? [Crowd cheering] (Oury) I'm for it. At least we'll be treated like human beings. [Crowd cheering] [People chattering] I don't care who we declare for so long as there's an Arizona territory. Are we staying? (Crowd) Yeah! That's what I wanted to hear. Come on, sol. (Man) Let's have a cheer for Jeff Davis. [Crowd hooraying] (Man) For the confederates. [Crowd hooraying] (Man) For the flag of the south. [Crowd hooraying] [All clamoring] Well, I guess they have a right to do that, when the north's run off with the only flag we know. The union can't be blamed, Phoebe. Usin' soldiers to hold the country together is more important than just watchin' over a few venturesome souls in Arizona. I'm not blamin' anybody but it gets my dander up to see how a doggoned war can mess up the plans of people who want to mind their own business. Well, there's troubled times ahead. Yeah. Wars don't last forever. We'll have to work twice as hard and think twice as fast. Lots of us are stayin' here, but later on, there's goin' to be plenty that's decided to pull out for safer country. Let 'em. And I'll buy their land with every dollar I've got. When good times come back I'll have a ranch you can't ride across in 2 days. Sol, this is a territory to invest in for the future. I never said it ain't. We're gonna have our hands full gettin' freight through. Freightin'? Phoebe, do you know that even stagecoaches won't run after today? People got to have food just the same, and thing's to wear, and we're gonna bring 'em in. We ain't haulin' a pound of freight till I decide there's a chance to get through, or till there's soldiers again in this territory. I say we are! I say we ain't! Phoebe, don't you understand? It's not that I'm afraid. I never ran away from a fight yet. But now is the time to sit tight until we see what's gonna happen. I know how you feel, sol, but I don't think that way. I'm startin' tomorrow night for fort Yuma with all our wagons, and I'm bringin' 'em back loaded. Are we still partners? No, Phoebe, I'll have nothin' to do with sendin' drivers to be murdered. Suit yourself, sol. Can I use your share of the outfit? Thanks. No hard feelings? Of course not. It'll be what I haul that'll keep your store open. *[Band playing] Who asked you in my office? Office? No man comes in here unless I want him to. And no man stays in Tucson if I don't like him. I'm here and I'm stayin' in Tucson. But... Sit down. I know all about you, ward. Yeah? Where are you from? Poor but honest parents. Is that a joke? You're the joke. Listen here! You listen. My name's Jefferson carteret. I heard you in the Plaza. You and your smart talk... Anybody with sense would know the confederates can't spare enough soldiers to handle this territory. Why, in 2 months the Indians'll have us barricaded in and starvin' to death. You have a freightin' business. Right now there's a fortune to be made and you're stealin' pennies. I was doin' all right. All right. But now with nobody to keep the Indians in line-- get them on your side. How many guns can you lay your hands on? Why? I said how many guns? Well, there's 8 cases of sharps rifles I'm supposed to haul to tubac. Ammunition? Yeah. Who's the head Indian around here? Mano. How can we talk to him? You're crazy. You mean make a deal with mano? The soldiers are gone, aren't they? Yeah, but you-- this country is wide open for the Indians, isn't it? Yeah. Well, what do the Indians need most? Guns and ammunition. To blow our heads off? Not our heads. We'll supply the guns and ammunition on condition that mano doesn't bother our freightin' wagons. Our wagons? From now on, I'm your silent partner. And, ward, you needed one badly because you're just a downright idiot. Nobody can say that about me. I said it. Why? That woman who spoke in the Plaza, Phoebe Titus. What were you doin' while she built up that freightin' outfit? I done everything a man could. It's all so simple. Hire her good drivers away from her and from anyone else in the business. Pay big wages that no one else can meet and add it on to the cost of haulin'. Yeah, I can do that. Th-that's good, ain't it? I'll show you how to run this town. Get word to mano that you want to make a treaty with him, and do it right away. Now look here, you-- I'm talkin'. And get those guns and ammunition loaded onto a wagon. And remember this... As far as the people of Tucson are concerned, I despise you just as much as does any other decent citizen. Never speak to me in public. Never mention our partnership. I don't care who you are. You ain't going to come here and start orderin' me around. My freightin' business belongs to me. I don't play, ward. Either you take me into partnership or I'll run everything alone. And you won't be around. 80 guns and 16,000 rounds of linen cartridges down there in the wagon, and more later. Here's the mark we'll use on our wagons, a black cross. Those are the only wagons you let through. What you do, not make treaty, but take guns away, kill you? I come to mano knowing of his great name and honor. Yeah, me, too. Give me your guns, I let your wagons go through. [Sighing] Well, good. Thank you, chief. Yeah, that's fine. [Man yelling] [Man grunting] You're the only real teamster we've got, Terry. Keep those wagons in line ahead of you. I'll do my best. Well, did you get to mano? Yep. That wagon train will never get a mile out of town. What did you tell him? Like you said, that they wasn't only goin' for supplies, but to get soldiers from fort Yuma. Ward, what happens tonight will throw the whole freightin' business right into our laps. Yes, sir. This territory is too important to be abandoned for long. It's the link with the far west. Whoever controls it will have a big job on his hands, and a big reward. That's me, huh? Yes, officially that's you. Stupid. I heared you. Oh, all right. You "heared" me. And don't follow me. Phoebe! Yes, sol? I know what I said yesterday was right about this bein' crazy but I sure am sorry you wouldn't let me join up. I know that, sol, but you belong here to keep this town runnin' till we get back. Be prayin' for you. Good luck. Thanks. Don't let 'em leave while I'm gone. Take care of yourself. *[Music playing] [Snickering] [Man whistling] [Indians ululating] Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! [Guns firing] [Ululating] (Man) Indians! Indians! The Indians are coming! Indians! [Guns firing] [Indians screeching] Warner, Indians are attacking Phoebe's wagon train. [Guns firing] [Indians ululating] [People clamoring] Hang on to them, Ed. [Indians ululating] [Guns firing] [Indians ululating] Have the Indians attacked so close to town before? It's those troops leavin'. [Speaking native language] You all right, Phoebe? Yeah. Well, I asked them to stay. Now it looks like they'll never be able to leave, let alone get in supplies. All I can say is I didn't know how bad thing's were going to be. This would have happened to those who were going yesterday. You're not to blame. Of course not. And we'll get supplies somehow. Sure we will, and I'm still glad I'm here. Doggone it, I wish a certain fella would quit playin' his banjo in California. (Man #1) Union soldiers are coming. Hundreds of 'em! Much more on their way! (Man #2) Union soldiers? Yep. Union soldiers are coming. Are they goin' to stay here? (Davis) What do you think they'll do to us? This is confederate territory. (Johnny) It ain't no more. Not with union soldiers movin' in. (Fiske) You know what we'll be? Prisoners of war. They'll take our property away from us and drive us out of Arizona. (Kirkland) No, they won't. Can't blame us for bein' deserted by the government now. I'm for bein' back in the union no matter what happens. We belong to the United States again, and I'm tellin' the world I'm doggone glad. (Job) Let the soldiers know how we feel. Give 'em a real greeting. [Crowd cheering] *[Band playing] [People cheering] [People whistling] Hey, there's sol. Hi, sol! Ain't this somethin' to holler about? Hey! Hiya, fellas. Hi, Phoebe. Look what we met. Where are they from? Advance guard, California column. California? Say, I wonder if-- yeah, he's here. [Men whooping] [People cheering] Hey, Ms. Phoebe. Well, soldier, did you see California? Yep, heard there was trouble out here. Glad to see us? That flag sure seems homelike. Still bakin' them pies? Maybe, for a hungry man. Well, you better start makin' tracks for home 'cause soon as I can figure to get leave from this army you're gonna have a visitor. There'll be a pie. What do we do now? [People cheering] *[Band continues playing] Put it on the table over there. Now you stay out of here unless I call you, see? [Giggling] [Knock on door] Well, I'll be dogged. What's ailin' you? Phoebe, you know, this is the first time I ever seen you in a dress? Any complaints? Just like I always figured. You sure are pretty. Nobody could look pretty feelin' as silly as I do. Well, there's a dinner on the table. You claim to be a man, let's see what you can do to it. Well, I'll be dogged. Turkey? Who shot it for you? Who do you think? I tailed it for 2 hours. Pie, Turkey... Phoebe, you sure are pretty. [Sighing] There ain't been a dinner like that in or near me in a long spell. Not even in California. You aren't much of a hand to talk while you eat, are you? Meals like that don't come often. Well, a lot happened to Arizona since you left. Those soldiers sure are welcome. I enlisted in California soon as I heard about it. I'm ready to settle down now. That gallivantin' fever is gone for good. Well, you're in the army, sergeant. You'll go where they tell you. My enlistment is up soon. Maybe I can get free even before then. Is that job still open? The stock could use some water. I asked you a question. I know you did. I'm thinkin'. A man named Jefferson carteret came here after you left. He helped to hold this town together when it looked like there wasn't gonna be any more town. You mean you took a fancy to him? I didn't say that. I'm just sizin' you up by comparin' you. Carteret wasn't jiggin' around California when I needed help. Didn't go lookin' for a shade tree when the rumpus started. I knew you'd never understand that. I understood, all right. But I'm different now. Are you? A year ago you went away, said, "see you soon." Now you're back sayin', "grab me while I'm here." What's different? Maybe I don't stand up so good when you start comparin'. I wish there was some way to show you how I am now. There is. Tell me. All I want is a chance. When will the colonel be here with the main body of troops? A couple of weeks. Why? I'm gonna have the best ranch in Arizona. But it takes money to get started. I want you to go to the colonel and get me an army freightin' contract. Is that all? Just walk up to the colonel and make him sign a contract. It can be done, for instance, by a man who wants to prove how good he is. Why don't you ask me somethin' easy like walkin' on water with a horse on my back. You asked for a chance, there it is. (Carteret) Good evenin', Ms. Phoebe. Oh, Mr. carteret, good evening. How are you? (Carteret) I'm well, thank you. I was just passin' by and stopped to pay my compliments. But I didn't know you had company. You know now. Um, Mr. carteret, this is sgt. Muncie. Peter, that's no way to be. I'm bein' the way I want. And this what's-his-name don't fit into my idea of a pleasant evenin'. Mr. Muncie! I'll consider the source, Ms. Phoebe. Meanwhile, I hope to see you soon, without the gentleman in the union suit. Good evenin'. Good evening. So that's what you've been comparin' me with. Insulting respectable people in Arizona isn't good for your health. I don't like him. How do you know? You never met him before. I got a good nose. He happens to be something you'll never be, a gentleman. He happens to be a sweet-lookin' dude, and a woman that'd pay any heed to him ought to have her head looked into. Oh, I see. In other words, you mean I'm just plumb crazy. Phoebe, I was only trying to tell you that-- good night, sgt. Muncie. Good night. The dinner was good. I'll see what I can do about that army freightin' contract. [Door closing] Teresa, I think I picked myself a man. [Laughing] See? "There bein' no security of life or property "within its borders, "it becomes the duty of the undersigned col. Carleton "to represent the authority of the United States over the people of Arizona." Martial law, that's what it is. [Men chattering] That sure fixes you, judge. [All laughing] My good man... Gentlemen, the colonel has merely stepped in to relieve me of a few of my administrative duties. I accept his generous offer of cooperation with open arms. (Man) That's what you say. Don't crowd me. Let's see, where was I? [Door opening] The colonel's just declared martial law. Yeah? And Phoebe's already got an order to supply hay for the government horses. And our drivers are quittin' to hook up with her. There's that soldier helpin' her. If she supplies hay, she'll be doin' their freightin' next. And with the army contract to build on, she'll take over all the business in this territory. Well, anyway, there's Indians to take care of her wagons. Idiot. She'll have army escorts. Ward, we haven't a chance. Huh. Unless we stop Phoebe right at the start. We can't fight the army. No. But we can help the army fight those who betray it. Huh? Have you declared allegiance to the union? Soon as you told me. There's one thing in our favor. The colonel doesn't know anything about anybody in Tucson yet. Buttercup, as a good citizen of the union, you're going to the colonel with confidential information about Ms. Phoebe Titus. That's sure takin' a chance. You want to keep control of the freightin' business, don't you? Why, sure I do. All right. How would you like to see your wagons with big banners on 'em, Lazarus ward, the government's choice? [Snickers] Do you think, maybe? I know it. And to prove your case, we might even dig up a confederate receipt with Phoebe's name on it. That alone would take the army freightin' away from her. Carteret, I think you've figured out a honey. [Chuckles] (Peter) Phoebe? Come in. (Phoebe) Hello. I see your wagons are all ready. Yep, and there's a first-rate teamster for every wagon that's lined up out there. I'll be back in business startin' at dawn, freightin' for the army. Oh, it's a wonderful feeling. A pie over there for you. What's the matter? Phoebe, here's an order from col. Carleton canceling your freightin' deal. Canceling? You're to report to him tomorrow morning. He doesn't say why. I found out a little from the adjutant. Somebody reported that you hauled ammunition for the confederates when they were here. I did not. That's what I wanted to hear. Who claims I did? Well, it's a confidential report. Now that you set me straight-- there's only one man that would do this, Lazarus ward. He's after the army freightin' business. The trouble is, how can I prove he's a liar with the confederates gone? If ward's the one, we'll see to it that he calls himself a liar in front of the colonel. Right now I've got to get back to the army camp and find out if it was him. I'll see you soon as I know. [Door closing] [Gasps] Open your mouth and I'll blow a hole clean through you. Get up. Start for my house through that door. Don't raise your hands, just act natural. Never mind your boots. What's come over you, Phoebe? What set you on the warpath? Ooh. [Gasping] *[Music playing] [People chattering] Where's ward? Well, I ain't seen him since early tonight. Maybe you can tell me where he is. I? Why should I know? You're around here often enough to know. [People chattering] Wait a minute. Walk straight ahead. You'll find a tinderbox. Light the candle on the table. Get away from that gun. You won't be so frisky come mornin'. I knew you were the one. Sit down. Not there, you'll poison my pie. Get over there, hurry up. Ward, did you ever see a man's stomach tore open by a shotgun? Why--why do you say that, Phoebe? If I get arrested tomorrow and sent off to yuma, it's gonna be very unhandy. Especially if you take over my freightin' business. I don't know what you're talkin' about. Maybe you don't remember tellin' col. Carleton that I declared for the south, that I sold ammunition to the confederates. Me? There ain't a word of truth. Ward, it's kind of horrifyin' to know you're gonna be killed. But it's a heap sight worse to know it's comin' and not know when. What do you mean, Phoebe? Can you write? Some. Why? Write on the back of that paper. Tell the colonel in your own hand that you told a pack of lies about me. I won't write nothin'. [Sighs] Suit yourself. Now, some time before mornin' I'm gonna let off both barrels of this shotgun right at you. I don't know just what time it'll happen. Whenever my finger gets to itchin' too much. But you can depend on it. You're gonna have a double hole blowed clean through you. Maybe 10 minutes, maybe 2 hours. All you have to do is sit comfortable till I think it's the right time. You wouldn't do it. [Quavers] I'm not ready yet. [Sighs] [Breathing heavily] Honest, Phoebe. I never told the colonel nothin'. Honest. Well, I guess I'd better be gettin' this over with. Brace yourself. Don't pull! I'll write. Don't pull. I'll write. You come close to bein' too late. Take that pencil and write down what I say. [Panting] Col. Carleton, there wasn't a word of truth to... Go ahead. Write. [Gun firing] [Clattering] Yeah. So I'm supposed to sit quiet and write my life away. Now we'll see who's gettin' holes blowed in 'em. (Peter) Drop that gun. Let's have some light in here, Phoebe. Soldier, am I glad to see you. I've been lookin' for you, ward. He's the one, all right. That's what I found out. (Ward) I was only tryin' to make a living. Almost had him writin' a letter to the colonel. Well, ward, I'll make it easy to understand. I don't like you and it would be a pleasure to kill you. You sit down and start writing or I'll pull this trigger fast till it won't shoot no more. I'll tell him what to put down. Whatever you want. Col. Carleton, there wasn't a word of truth to what I said about Phoebe Titus haulin' ammunition for the confederates. You're talkin' too fast. Then listen to me once and write it the second time. I want to get this set in my mind right now. I made it up to get rid of her, so as I could ruin her freightin' business. She never took sides either way, but minded her own business. And furthermore, col. Carleton, I am a no-good skunk. Yeah, that makes it plain. That's what you'll put down just before you sign your name. And now since you've got a pretty good idea, let's start writin' again. Col. Carleton, there wasn't a word of truth to what I said... Say, you'd better stay here tonight and guard this skunk so we can deliver him and his message to the colonel in the morning. You're the boss. Ward, when you did this to my pie, you went too far. [Yelling] [Gasping] [Horses clomping] We're all ready to go, ma'am. 10 wagons. All right. Pick up your army escort at the camp. Yes, ma'am. Indians start anything, take your orders from whoever's in charge of the soldiers. That suits me. See you soon. So long, Terry. Hiya, pop. Hello, lady. Uh, Joe, better go get your eats. Wouldn't I be a mess scrunched over a bunch of figures in here? What made you think of that? I'm leavin' the army. Gettin' your discharge? Couple of weeks. I thought it all over, Phoebe. I concluded you need somebody around here. That's right. You been havin' more trouble than one person can handle. So I decided we better share it, all the way. You askin' me to marry you? Roundabout. Is there still somethin' you don't like about me? No, it's not that. If there wasn't somethin' I didn't like about a man, I couldn't stand the sight of him. Then what's troublin' you? Do you know why I'm workin' so hard in this freightin' business? You said once so you'd have the best ranch in Arizona. I got the ranch land. Bought it dirt cheap from people pullin' outta here. Now all I have to do is build on it and irrigate. I know some about ranchin'. Can you tell good cattle when you see 'em? That ain't hard. Seen any around here? No. Peter, I'll tell you honest. There's nothin' I'd like better than to have you move out onto that ranch with me as my husband. Well, I'm glad to hear it. As soon as you take care of a little errand for me. Errand? Yeah. I want you to go to Nebraska territory, pick out 500 head of the best eastern-bred cattle and bring 'em back here. Errand? It won't be long now before the railroads will be gettin' this far west. They'll Brin' in more people than you can shake a stick at. Minin' men, thousands of real American families. And I'm gonna be ready for 'em, with the finest herd of beef and dairy cattle in this territory. Nebraska. The war hasn't hit Nebraska yet. There's bound to be men there that got out of the east with their stock before trouble started. I want you to pick out 500 head of the best. Gosh almighty. I'm quittin' the army to settle down with you and the first thing you do is send me away for a honeymoon with 500 cows. And who can say they won't be fightin' the whole darn war in Nebraska when I get there? The next time the army paymaster comes to town, I'll have $15,000, all told. I'm turnin' that over to you, every cent I have in the world, to make somethin' possible I've dreamed about ever since I came to Arizona. That money is our life together, our future. I'm trusting it to you. Who said I was goin'? You'll go. Yes, I'll go, because a man in love with a woman don't have his right mind. It sounded kind of pretty the way you said it, about our life together, our future. You're the one that can make it happen. Yeah. But right now I'm goin' out and buy myself a drink, a sheepherder's delight with a mule's hind foot in it. Maybe then my head'll quit rattlin'. Errand! *[Fiddles playing] [People chattering] I hope that army paymaster don't run out of money. They owe me for 200 hams. Considering the load of money that Phoebe carried out of here, he might go bankrupt at that. Evenin', sergeant. Helpin' to keep the town quiet? Yep. Last night in the army and I drew patrol duty. Well, judge, Johnny take care of you all right? No complaints, sol. Howdy, soldier. Judge. [Rain patterning] Looks like a little Arizona dew. Mind if we share your dry spot? It's still a free country. Well, sir, I'm always glad when that army paymaster of yours comes to town. Government pays what it owes to the people, soldiers spend what they earn, and everybody in town gets benefited or drunk. From what I remember you should be carousin' around with the worst of 'em. No, no, I'm a changed man, soldier. My heart did a back tumble on me and I sort of got religion. I ain't had a drink in 6 months, and even Ms. Phoebe took kindly to me. Well, the ranchers can use this rain. It sure is good. Hmm. Warner, uh, you've lived in Tucson quite a spell. Do people get out of hand much celebratin' when the army paymaster comes to town? Oh, a little shootin' and such. This is a good time to have your money in a San Francisco bank. I only drew out enough for operating expenses. I tried to tell Phoebe to leave hers on deposit. Well, maybe the rains will keep thing's quiet. I guess I'm due for some sleep. Good night. Evening. All ready. I saw her put the money in the safe. Carteret, I don't know about blowin' that safe. It'll make a lot of noise. Try to make her give you the key. These men are supposed to be bandits from Mexico, they're not to talk. I only thought-- I told you to quit thinkin'. Get whatever is in the safe, head for the border and then circle back here. Is that plain? Yeah. Sure. All right, clear out. Yeah, clear out. [Sighing] [Door closing] [Phoebe yelling] [Explosion] [Sighing] Well, that's that. Why couldn't you wait to get your money from the army paymaster tomorrow when I'd be out of the army. What happened, Phoebe? Joe, go to the army post. Tell 'em Mexican bandits just robbed me of $15,000. I'll be dogged. Which way did they head? Back towards sonora, no tellin' where they'll end up. Hurry, Joe. Yes. Why don't you start after them? Nobody's ever gonna trail those men. It's rainin' pitchforks. There won't be a sign left. Well, we might as well give up our trip to Nebraska. Good mornin'. Oh, hello. Have you got a minute? Sure. Joe, you'd better go get your eats. Have a seat. Thank you. Well, I haven't seen you around lately. I've been away quite a bit. Investigatin' minin' properties. I was sorry to hear of the robbery. Oh, spilled milk. Ms. Phoebe, I don't want to seem meddlesome, but several people have told me that on account of the robbery you're in rather a difficult position over some plans you've made. Well, I guess it's no secret. To speak plain, I'm just about stopped cold. They say you'd like to bring some eastern-bred cattle here. Well, do you think I'm crazy, too? Here's my opinion. When a lady has that much faith in herself and in the future of this territory, I'd say she was a better investment than a copper mine. I'll lend you as much as you need. You mean you'll lend me $15,000? 15 or 20, at any interest you think it's worth. Is 6% all right? Certainly. We'll name your freightin' equipment and ranch land as security. If you think it's too much-- no, that's fair. I'll draw up the note and bring the money. It'll be a few minutes. Mr. carteret, if there was any way of thanking you... Oh, that's all right. I wish you and your soldier the best of luck. Where did you get it? Uh, carteret. Why did you go to him? I didn't. He came to me. I know you don't think much of him, Peter-- where'd he get $15,000? He came out here to invest in mining properties. He came to you, huh? Just walked up and offered the money. Yeah. How much did you have to give for it? 6%. And I put up my freightin' property and ranch land for security. Well, maybe if I'd thought about it for a while I never would have taken the loan. But it was my only chance to get what was almost lost for good, so I grabbed it. Well, I guess you know your own business. But from the little checkin' I've been doin' I'd say the whole thing smells of polecat. Why? Phoebe, I'm the man you're gonna marry, is that right? Yes. So when I tell you the man's no good without bein' able to prove it, who-whose side are you on? You know the answer to that. All right. Well, anyway, he's furnished what we wanted. Plenty of time to check up on him when you get back from Nebraska. Yeah. I'd better get ready because the quicker I leave, the quicker I'll get back. Then I'll do some real findin' out. Did you do it? Yep! If Muncie doesn't get back to Arizona with the cattle, we'll take over Phoebe's freightin' business and land. If he does, there'll be an Indian attack just before he reaches Tucson, and we'll still own everything the lady has. And all did with her own money. Yes, sir, buttercup. That's how it's did. [Chuckles] Well, I'm ready. Say. Oh, Teresa made this specially for your goin' away. So we don't have to say anything more about that. All right. There's an army scoutin' party leavin'. Be good company as far as camp bowie. From then on-- I ain't worried. Maybe I've been crawdaddin' quite a bit about the trouble I'd run into, but I kind of think I'm gonna enjoy it. I know. Hang on to that money. It's gonna spoil my rest, but I'll sleep on it every night. There's a little somethin' I got for you to take along. It might come in handy with you travelin' alone so much. Well, I'll be. I never seed a gun this pretty. It's a Henry. The important thing is it shoots 16 brass cartridges without reloading. 16? [Whistles] This case is filled with cartridge tubes. All you have to do is empty one of these into your gun and start shootin'. More shells in that package. Phoebe, I never expected nothin' like this. That ranch will be ready when you get back. Every penny I make freightin' will be spent in building. There's good adobe for bricks right on the place, labor's cheap. You sure sound like you mean business. I do. We're goin' to have the best cattle ranch in Arizona. I wish I could forget that you're a woman, and I'm leavin' you here alone. If you run into any trouble, save it for me. And if you happen to find out my guess is right about that dude, keep quiet till I get back. Whatever you do, don't talk out of turn. I'll take care of myself. I guess the trip will take about 6 months, buyin' the cattle and linin' up some good hands to bring 'em back but don't you worry. Peter. Gosh almighty. That sure was good. Now, skedaddle. Those soldiers will be on their way back before you get started. Phoebe, could I-- I said skedaddle. Everything will be waitin' on you. See you sometime, honey. I want some cloth for curtains, 15 yards, finest chintz you got. And all the China dishes you can lay your hands on. Phoebe, I don't mind sellin' all the thing's you've ordered these past months, but why do you keep on puttin' every dollar you earn into that ranch? I told Peter it would be ready when he got back. Besides, where is there a better place to put it? Well, I just mean that anybody that owes as much money as you do should be careful about what's spent. Especially when you're in debt to a man like carteret. Why do you say "a man like carteret"? Well, I can't just put my finger on why I don't trust the man, but there is plenty of other people in town gettin' suspicious of him, too. Why? Well, I guess it's mainly because he don't seem to be doin' nothin' for a livin'. And bein' seen around so much lately with ward. Yeah. Peter gave me some ideas about carteret a long time ago. I guess he knew what he was talkin' about. What did he say? Now you just forget about that. See that everything gets out to my house the first of the week, because it will be ready inside by then. All right, I'll bring the last load out myself. Like to see how the place is comin'. Good. Say, keep your ears open for any word from army scouts about any cattle headed this way. Mmm-hmm. Uh, Teresa. Si, senorita. Here comes sol with another load. Have a couple of men move it into the house, will you? Si, senorita. Take it around the back. Hiya, sol. Hi, Phoebe. Well, there is your last load. I guess that about winds up everything. Thanks, sol. Heard any news from the army scouts yet? Not yet. Those cattle are gettin' near, I can feel it in my bones. Well, how does the place look to you now? Couldn't be better. The rest of the fruit trees get put in today, all the plantin' around the house. Now all we need is that furniture sittin' in the rooms, and the smell of some good cookin' in the kitchen. Say, you sure talk a fine meal. That tree helps a lot, don't it? Yeah, I suppose so. How? Oh, it's nice to have plenty of shade for a man to cool off in the heat of the day and watch his cattle grazin' down there in the valley. Oh, that man, huh? Yep, that man. Say, wouldn't it be somethin' if you was to have the first American baby born in Arizona? Why not? Oh, well, I--I guess you... What does he want? Now, be careful, Phoebe, he's done nothin' wrong till there's proof. Don't worry. Good mornin'. (Warner) Howdy. Good mornin'. Have you heard from Mr. Muncie? No. That's very unfortunate. Oh, there's no cause to worry. I'm sorry I can't agree with you. What do you mean? That loan's due tomorrow. Tomorrow? I don't remember you setting any date. You accepted the money on those terms. I don't care what your terms are. I can't pay you that soon. You know she can't pay now. You know this just fits in with what I've been guessing about you and your business dealing's. Ms. Phoebe, you've accused me of somethin'. What? Just what you think. You owe me a direct answer. Is that right, Warner? She's never traded yet on bein' a woman, have you, Phoebe? That doesn't matter. I have a man to answer for what I say. That satisfies me. Say it. All right. I've concluded that a woman that borrows her own money that was stolen from her is a downright fool. That isn't quite clear. You didn't have the money to lend me till after my safe was robbed. Is that clear? It is. Carteret, if you'll allow for the fact that Phoebe's upset about this-- never mind. I've been called a thief by someone I tried to help. All right, I'll take over this property tomorrow, and get satisfaction from Mr. Muncie, if he returns. [Mooing] [Man whistling] [Men yelling] Whoa! Hold the wagon. [Birds chirping] [Man yelling] [Men whistling] All right, go ahead. Tell mano the important thing is to get those cattle away from Muncie. Yes, sir. He'll need about 50 Indians for that. Stupid. Those men with Muncie are fighters or they wouldn't have come this far. Tell mano we'll need 100 braves. Yes, sir. Say, Phoebe, there's a scout says a cattle outfit is camped a half day east of here. How many cattle? 500, 600. (Warner) Did the scout say anything about it bein' Muncie's outfit? No, it came through in a hurry. It's bound to be him. (Warner) And where are you goin'? I'm ridin' out to meet him. Through that Indian country? You won't leave here unless you get an army escort, not if I have to hog-tie you. What do you think could harm me now? Then I'll go with you. No, you won't. This is somethin' that belongs to me. Alone. [Speaking native language] You did it. [Speaking native language] [All ululating] [Mooing] Hiya! Are these Muncie's cattle? Yeah. Where is he? [Cows mooing] There's your cows. How many did you lose? Started out with 506, got this far with 520, countin' calves. [Cattle mooing] Well, they look kind of gaunt. You might say they'd come a little ways. Did you have much of a trip? Brushed 3 times with sioux and once with apaches. I ain't sorry it's finished. [All ululating] [Guns firing] What was I sayin' about this trip bein' finished? They're after our cattle. We're losin' our cattle, let's fight. That won't help. We got one chance. Have the men on this side get ahead of the herd, and we'll try to stampede 'em back into the Indians. Hurry. Get to the head of the herd. We're gonna drive 'em into the Indians. [Men yelling] [Guns firing] [Men yelling] [Men grunting] [Guns firing] [Sighs] [Panting] Say, this must have been some errand. Well, you finally owned up you didn't send me after a spool of thread. Yeah. Those cattle sure earned a rest. You better have that ranch ready. It's ready, all right, if we can hang onto it. What happened? Carteret put a time limit on that loan. He's takin' over everything. He is, huh? Not while I'm around. I've had plenty of time to figure on this trip, and I decided carteret's behind everything that's been workin' against you. He's been seen around a lot with ward lately. The whole town's noticed it. That makes my figurin' right. I'll bet this herd of cattle they stole your $15,000. I hope you can prove that in a hurry, because I already talked us into a mess. I told you to keep quiet till I got back. I know, but when carteret showed up yesterday to collect I--I kinda lost my head. What did you say? I called him a thief. He said I wouldn't dare say that if I wasn't a woman. Well? I, uh, I told him I had a man to answer for what I said. That's right. That's what you should've said. All he wanted was an excuse to start gunnin' for you. Now he's got it. No tellin' what will happen. Yeah. Now don't you start lookin' for trouble. The important thing for us to do is to figure out how to hang onto that ranch. I was afraid thing's might get quiet, but with carteret gunnin' for me, there's gonna be plenty happenin' around Tucson when we get in. Let's go. There's a turnoff ahead that goes right past the ranch. Turnoff? Lady, we're drivin' this herd of cattle right to Tucson so the whole blamed town can take a look. No. Yes. Get 'em movin'! [Men yelling] [Men whistling] [Cattle mooing] [Men yelling] [Man whistling] [Sighs] That puddingheaded Indian chief. All those guns and he still lets Muncie get through. You're always the smart one. What can we do? It looks like I'll have to take care of Mr. Muncie right now. You can't shoot from here. The whole town would know. Shut up. But you've... [Man whistling] There they are. I wish you'd picked a safer way to show off these cattle. Keep your eyes peeled for trouble now. I know what I'm doin'. [Peter grunting] Good work, Muncie. Thanks, Bart. We're all ready to start celebratin' as soon as you set the date for that weddin'. Well, you can pick your own date, just so it's no later than tomorrow. Right? Yeah, well, let's get movin'. You can give the bride away, sol, and Bart, you can hold me up. [Cattle mooing] I sure hope there'll be no shootin' match to spoil this. [Men grunting] Where are you goin'? After carteret. Now's as good a time to settle as any. Wait! Your errand isn't finished till you get these cattle onto that ranch, that comes first. Listen, Phoebe-- we'll take care of personal matters later. Let's finish what we're doin'. A man can't even pick his own time to go skunk huntin'. Why--why can't we go out tomorrow and take over the ranch before they raise the money? Then we can sell it for more than they owe us. Be quiet. There he is. Wait! I got somethin' to say about this, I'm your partner. Yes, I hadn't thought... You're still my partner. This shootin' won't help nothin'. Ward, at last you've used your head. You're right. A shootin' won't help. No. Let's get out of town for a while, in case Muncie starts lookin' for me. Then, when we come back, we can take over legally, as you suggested. You're gettin' me so upset lately, I'm surprised I can think at all. [Laughs] In a little while, though, you won't have anything to worry about, partner. You sure you got that paper wrote good? We can demand the security or the money outright without havin' to foreclose or nothin'? That I can. Quit talkin' that way. You're raisin' your voice, ward. I don't like that. Then stop actin' funny. You get me so I don't know whether you're waitin' to plug me in the back, or what. [Snickers] I'm a man of my word. I don't shoot people in the back. And I haven't forgotten that you took me into partnership when I didn't have a penny in the world. That means a lot to me, ward. Oh. I just wanted you to know that I appreciate that, even if I do like my little joke now and then. That's all right. We'll break up our partnership if you want, but we'll still be the best of friends. Won't we? (Ward) Sure. I'm sorry for the way I acted. But so many thing's have been happenin' to me I guess I'm gettin' too suspicious, I-- [gun firing] You next, Mr. Muncie. [Man exhaling] [Gasping] Who did this? Muncie. What did you tell him? He acted like he knew everything about us. I had to keep answerin' questions or get killed. What did you tell him? All about robbin' Phoebe, the Indian deal, everything. If you aren't out of town in 5 minutes... I'll go. Where's timmins and longstreet? Cleared out, headed for yuma. You're the only proof Muncie's got. I know. My horse is outside. Start movin'. Sure, sure. They won't catch me. Where's ward? Get movin'. [Thudding] We'll need lots of room for the weddin'. Everybody within 50 miles will be here. Sure. Free drinks, free dancin', and plenty of free-for-alls. Gentlemen. There's a kind of religious feel to this weddin' of Phoebe Titus and Peter Muncie. And I'd say the festivities ought to be sort of decorous. Meanin' the whole town shouldn't get drunk simultaneous? There's just one way to do this. Start her whizzin' at sunup and let her rip till the whole town's wore out. (Terry) That's what I'm sayin'. (Man) What's a celebration without any celebratin'? Sure! My friends, them days is gone. We're... Well, Muncie, it looks like you sort of caught us in the act of preparin' for your weddin'. (All) Yeah. I don't mean to interrupt your plans, gentlemen, but I wonder if anybody can tell me where I can find carteret? He might be in ward's saloon. I've been there. Come to think of it, I ain't seen him today. Any of you men? No. Nope. I been busy since I got back, and what I found out you'll all know when the time's right. There's a herd of skunks in this town that ain't got a right to live and when I finish with the head one, you can do what you want with the rest. I'm handlin' Jeff carteret myself. Men, if this weddin' happens, it's gonna be darn nigh historic. *[Music playing] [People chattering] [People chattering] Good mornin', Jose. Turn the buggy around, will you, please? Si, senor. [Cows mooing] Senorita will be ready very soon. This is a special day, so it takes time. [Giggling] You wait, no? I guess that's the thing to do. Well, I hurry to the Plaza now and buy some flowers for throwin' at the bride and groom. I see you there, maybe? I'll be lookin'. Felicidades. Hello, honey. I, uh, notice you drifted right to the shade tree. Think it's in a good spot? Like it was put here to order. It was. [Chuckling] Well, what do you know? Phoebe, this may not be exactly the wedding celebration we'd hoped for. Why? Well, carteret's set to make trouble, all right, soon as we're married. Maybe he was only talking. A lot's been happenin'. Ward's dead, and carteret's killed Haley. I guess he's gettin' his house in order so there won't be anybody around to talk against him. Includin' you. That's fair enough, considerin' I'm plannin' the same for him. Peter, why don't you handle this in a lawful way? Prove what you know about him in court, before it's too late. I just told you he'd killed Haley, the only witness I had. But why risk everything for the sake of a personal shooting? We've got ourselves to think about. We can stop him from making trouble if you'll only ask for help. Phoebe, ain't you the one that said you got a man to stand up for you? I'm sorry, I forgot. Let's go. I started this trouble for you, started it by talkin' like a darned old woman. Straighten up. You're supposed to be the man around here. Not anymore. You ain't worried, honey. That's better. Thanks, Jose. [Cattle mooing] Sure is a sight. Let's make sure we come back to it together. Well, you got to admit it's worth fighting for. *[Music playing] Here they come. Here they come. Change the music, come on, come on. [People cheering] [People clapping] [People whooping] [Man whoops] Fellow citizens! This is the most important event in the history of the Arizona territory. The weddin' of the first American woman here markin' as it does the westward strides of civilization, practically moves us up into the class of a Metropolis. [People cheering] [People whistling] What's happening now? The weddin's started. [People murmuring] Keep goin'. Peter Muncie, do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife, protectin' her like a man should, standin' by her in sickness and in health as long as you both shall live? I do. Phoebe Titus, do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband, promisin' to stick by him, no matter how bad thing's get as long as you both shall live? I do. Who gives this woman to be married to this man? I do. You got the ring, ain't you, Bart? Such bein' the case, I hereupon order Peter Muncie to place the symbol of eternal faithfulness upon the fair hand of his beloved choice, and repeat after me. With this ring, I thee wed... With this ring, I thee wed... ...with my soul, I thee worship... ...with my soul I thee worship... ...and with all my worldly goods I thee endow. ...and with all my worldly goods I thee endow. In consequence of which declaration, I now pronounce you man and wife. [People cheering] Congratulations. *[Band playing] It's over. They're married. Poor Phoebe, a bride for 5 minutes. Get out. Well, I suppose you're pretty anxious to get goin'. Yes, as soon as we're settled-- Warner, would you mind opening your store for my wife and letting her wait there for me? If you want. Peter, I... [People clapping] [People whooping] See you later, honey. [Music stops] [People murmuring] You better stay where you are. Let's go, sol. Ladies and gentlemen, this is a day of festivities. Enjoy yourselves. Music, my good men. Music. *[Music playing] [Gunshots] [Music stops] There's some thing's I need for the ranch. I'll order 'em while I'm here. Phoebe, don't you think you-- please, write down what I order. 100 pound sack of flour, 4 of Pete kitchen's hams, and, uh, 50 pounds-- [gunshots] 50 pounds of sugar, best grade you got. (Warner) Phoebe, hadn't you ought to prepare yourself, just in case? My husband told me he'd meet me here. Did you put down the sugar? [Footsteps approaching] (Peter) I'm ready, Phoebe. *[Music playing] Sol, send those thing's out the house as soon as you can, will you? They'll be there today, Phoebe. Thanks for the weddin' party, fellas. Yeah, thanks. I'll fix that hand up when we get home. What a woman, nothin' but iron from topknot to gizzard. And that's no jackrabbit with her. Well, I'd say this territory's got quite a future. Yes, sir, quite a future. Jose. Well, we're back. Yeah. Doggone it, Peter, if this is what it's like to be in love, I'm glad I'm only going to love but once.
