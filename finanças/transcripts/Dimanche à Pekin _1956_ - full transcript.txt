With the support of CNC, this restoration was made in 2013 from the Kodachrome 16mm original film - images by Eclair Group, sound by LE Diapason. This film was awarded the Grand Prize for Short Films 1956 Sunday in Peking For 30 years in Paris, I had been dreaming about Peking without knowing it. In my imagination I could still see an illustration from a book I had looked at in my childhood, without knowing exactly what it referred to. It was, in fact, a scene at the Gates of Peking. The avenue leading to tombs of the Ming Emperors. And one fine day, there I was. It's not very often that one can step into a picture belonging to one's childhood. Yet, here I am, on this Ming avenue, with the Ming camels, like trussed chickens in their immobility, the Ming warriors, those unknown soldiers, the horses, the life-size Ming elephants. All sorts of animals two-by-two, placed there to guide the traveler, with no possibility of error, to the precise spot where, in fact, the Ming Emperors are not buried. Where they are buried, that's their own affair. A triumphal arch on a road leading nowhere - that might well be the symbol of China. It's dawn. The gates of Peking are still griped in mist, as if the all city were just coming out of a steam bath. The secret of the tombs was one form of Chinese politeness. The mist is perhaps another. This filmy veil that comes between people, that prevents them from touching each other, or staring at each other, this city at the bottom of the sea, this dusty light, midway between water and silk, all this is still politeness, but is already a form of painting. No, this is not an absent-minded surgeon, it's a townsman protecting himself against the dust. Until their brick buildings and barrier could take up the job. For the revolution was directed against the capitalists, but also against dust, disease and flies. The result is that one still finds capitalists in China, but there are no more flies. And on its way to a future without capitalists, disease and flies, here is the China of tomorrow. The China which gives me a cheerful greeting. In the park where the China of tomorrow has lead me, a Pekinese of today is doing his physical exercise. Here the traditional sword takes the place of the western dumbbells. The sword calls for more skill than the dumbbells. For, with the same movement of the wrist, you have to whirl something heavy, the sword, and something light, the silk tassel with its pompoms. After proving his skill in this stylized violence, the Pekinese of today engages in a boxing match with one of his friends. The spectators tell me that this is Chinese boxing - one rarely hits or is hit. The all skill lies in knowing when and how to dodge or to come to grips. When I ask who these energetic over-forties are, I'm told quite simply that they are patients from a local hospital for whom physical exercise has been prescribed. Pei Hai, the northern lake, the ancient Winter Palace of the Emperors. Here again I find my children of mist. They look half-squirrel and half-apple. Their appearance is so charmingly traditional that one has to make an effort to remember that 25 years ago, amidst the filth of the Peking streets, every morning one found little red bundles: children that had died in night. That was the time when our parents saved their tinfoil wrappers of the chocolate bars for the children in China. I can't delude myself into believing that our silver paper was of much help. But after all, for a western conscience, there is something satisfying in the thought that one at least of these young athletes, leans as cats, may owe his existence to our mother's chocolate. 10 o'clock. A Ming steamroller - unless it's just a copy - is leveling one of the walks of the Winter Palace. It's time to take a pedicab. Those contraptions that have replaced the rickshaw and mingled with the hustle of the Chinese town. The Chinese town, that is to say, the suburb that more or less escaped the geometric planning imposed by the Mongol conquerors. With its streamers, its sign boards and all of paraphernalia of incomprehensible publicity. This is the China of the movies. You'd expect to see Humphrey Bogart in a white suit coming out of an opium den. But there are no more opium dens; and lovers of the picturesque can always turn back to those fragments of old China that the flow of modern life still carries along with it. The price of modernism does not seem so high when we see the harsh price of the picturesque. For instance, this woman with deformed feet, a survival of the days of the empire. Through tight Ch'ien-men, the Gate of Purity, we move from one city to another. From the Chinese town to the Tartar town. This is regularly arranged in squares enclosing the Imperial Palace. It's less commercial then the Chinese city, though its outer avenues are in permanent use as a market. And beyond these, there is a third city, the town that is being built: the Peking of 2000 AD. With the labor of mule and man, it is arising. A Peking which fortunately does not owe much to European forms of architecture. It is a Peking where the blend of tradition and novelty is symbolized by the presence, at the top of modern building, of something like hereditary mannerism: the four up-turned corners of a Tartar tent. It is in this model district that we've come to see a model school with its model little girls, who are playing or doing practical work in the free air. A class in the open air, a class to the light, Giraudoux. Where retorts and blast furnaces become the most delightful things in the world and where meteorology is studied side-by-side with crochet work. I'm ashamed to confess that I interrupted the march of History for a moment, and by showing the class a picture book from France, caused general confusion. But the book is written in French, and the sight of these queer symbols gives the young Chinese, I am told, all the thrills of the exotic. 11 o'clock. I've moved to another district and here I am the Bridge of Heaven. It used to be a criminal area. It's remained a little oasis of unorganized activity. It used to be the court of miracles, now it's a fair. Midday, and back in the street again. The policeman does not blow a whistle, that would not be polite. He addresses pedestrians and cyclists in terms that, though vigorous, are always grammatically correct. The children's bus which takes youngsters to school or to the park. And all along the streets, the permanent exhibit of the treasures of Peking. From the penny toys they sell on the pavements, to the shops cover with characters, as if they were huge boxes of tea. It is a feast of color. There is color everywhere: On the walls, on the fruit, on the pastry shops and on the children's toys; on the musical instruments they're selling in the open air; on the theatrical costumes; on the sweetmeats; on the cheap porcelain in the market, and on the precious porcelain in Liu Li Chang, the street of the antique dealers. On roofs, as well. And the all town is a display stand for Ancient China. With its temples, with its bronze animals and its porcelain roofs. This is no longer the China of the movies, it's the China of Jules Verne, of Marco Polo. And in this Forbidden City, the golden centre where the old imperial spider wove her web, in this Forbidden City, now a museum close to the still white Beijing Cathedral, threaten symbolically by the horns of pagodas, one's imagination is caught up in History. One dreams of a fabulous China, with a past more remote than the concealed faces of the moon, revealed only by the roosters crowing in the night and the shi lions staring at the Sun. One thinks of the troops of Genghis Khan penetrating the passes of the mountains edged by the Great Wall, that masterpiece of the Chinese Emperors. A Maginot line 6.000 miles long and just about as useless. The horsemen descending on the plains and giving it over their Tartar thieves. The Tartar thieves with soulful eyes like those of girls. The Ancient Peking destroyed and transformed into a Mongol sub-district. The grandson of the conqueror, Kublai Khan, rebuilding the capital and imposing upon it an order that would indorse for seven centuries. And sowing in his palaces a blue flower that grows only in Mongolia to assuage the homesickness of his troops. And the weariness of the conquerors, their inability to impose order on this vast mass. And the beginning of an era of legendary wars that still resound through the Peking Opera House today. The all History of China, the truly historical and the legendary, lives again in the theatre and in the marionettes. There is Sun Wukong, King of the Monkeys and thief who robbed Heaven, half-Prometheus and half-Charlie Chaplin. There are the gods, bearing sledgehammers and thunderbolts. There're the monsters, tigers, dragons, who come and take food from a girl's hand and respond to her caresses. There're the courtesans, who died of love; the girls of noble family, who married gardeners; and the generals, ancestors of all those generals who for 2.000 years made and destroyed China. Until one 1st of October, the Chinese people celebrated their Bastille Day, their Day of Revolution. Let us say no more about History. In the gardens, during the afternoon, History goes on. So long shut away behind its symbols, China is now call upon to reveal itself. And we are required to understand these sensitive faces, these men, these women, these children with whom we shall share History, as we shall have to share our daily bread. This crowd, so truly human, delights in being face to face with animals. The zoo in Peking is full of visitors. Here is this crowd, like a broad blue river, with its pairs of lovers chatting tenderly about the five-year plan. Here is this crowd, which bears you along like a mighty ocean. No amount of exasperation or pushing will carry you against it. Around this bear, children are dancing to a little tune that will stay with me until the end of the afternoon. We end our Sunday at the Summer Palace. The Pioneers have taken possess of the islands. Their laughter and their songs are like birds in the silence. All this is as remote as China, and as familiar as Hyde Park. Against this background of past splendor, in the avenues of this Mongol Versailles, one wonder about both past and future. But for my part, as I look at these scenes and take them in and listen to them, I just wonder, at the close of this sabbath day in Peking, whether China itself is not the sabbath of the whole world.
