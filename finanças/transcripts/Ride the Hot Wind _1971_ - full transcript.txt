This is Mel Green. I'm standing just outside the main gate of Fort Brennan which has been the focal point of world-wide reaction for the last several months due to the trial of Captain Gregory Shank. Throughout the night, protestors have been arriving armed with placards bearing the demand of free Shank. Shank, a West Point graduate, stands accused of ordering and participating in the now infamous My Wan Massacre. As yet, there's been no comment from Shank's father, retired Major General William Wild Bill Shank. Today marks the penalty phase of the lengthy trial. And we're standing by to give you up to the minute news as it breaks here at Fort Brennan. This is KBI News. There's Shank! Let Shank go. Let Shank go. Let Shank go. Let Shank go. Let Shank go. Let Shank go. Mel Green again here at Fort Brennan. The protestors have massed together at the end of a main road and are now moving forward, chanting as they come. The military police have warned the protestors of a possibility of civil authorities being called. There have been several minor confrontations between the military and the protestors, but as yet, no violence. Ten hup. - Let the record show that this court's Marshall was called to order, on this, the 10th day of July, to hear the final arguments. Captain, are you ready? - Ready sir. And you Major? - I am General. - Then let us proceed. - Officers of the court, it is a paramount rule in our system of justice to hold a man innocent until proven guilty. Such was not the case in Captain Shank's trials. I say trials because there have been two. One in this court room and one in the news media. - We are here to try a man in a court of military justice, not to discuss the relative merits of our judicial system and the news media. - Are we to make Captain Shank the scapegoat for appeasement of countries we are theoretically at war with? - Is the Captain inferring that this sovereign country and its military tribunal would, sacrifice one of its officers to satisfy the whim of a communist nation? No Captain, I think not. I think you are attempting to cloud what to me is a very clear issue. You are defending a murderer. - You assume a great deal Major. Captain Shank is not a murderer. We have taken this man and taught him that it is honorable to defend his country's principals. - On what military installation do they teach the fine art of murdering women and children? We taught this man to kill, yes, but in defense of himself, his men and his country. - Gentlemen, I ask that you take one final and complete look at the evidence. That a massacre did occur, we do not deny. That someone gave orders that the village be leveled, we do not deny. That civilians, women and children were killed, we do not deny. But we do and with great conviction, deny that Captain Shank gave those orders. We further deny that he was anywhere near the village when those orders were carried out. - Thank you Captain. Major, we'll now hear your argument. - Him, but we have but one focus here. A clear, and decisive policy. Which will erase this stain from our military history. I ask that the defendant be found guilty of all charges and specifications and thereby be taken to a place of confinement and put to death. - Are there any further arguments? Very well then. We shall retire to form an opinion. Ten hup. - We the board, after hearing all of the evidence, having examining all of the exhibits, and having heard all of the arguments, have reached a verdict and all do concur. Before we read this verdict and pass sentence, does the defendant have anything to offer in his behalf? - Only that I'm not guilty sir. On the charge contained in article 26, we the board find the defendant not guilty. On the charges and specifications contained in article 14 and 17, paragraphs nine and 11, we find the defendant guilty of involuntary manslaughter for reasons that he was in command, although absent from his post on the aforementioned day, at which time the incident occurred. We sentence the defendant to six months of hard labor in the post stockade, loss of all rank and privileges, and a dishonorable discharge from the service of the Army of the United States of America. He is warned that should he be found in any U.S. government property after his expulsion from this installation, he is subject to rearrest and will be transported to the federal prison at Fort Leavenworth to serve a period of confinement not to exceed 21 years. You're branded Shank. Branded for the rest of your life. You're gonna pay for every guy in uniform you screwed up, you son of a bitch. Now get him outta here. - Can I give you a lift? - You already have. Are you going far? - I'm not sure. How far you going? - To Vegas, I'm going down to visit some friends. - Ah, Vegas is good town. I was there once on leave. - I thought you were a soldier, I saw your bag. That's the reason I stopped. I never pick up hitch hikers. I figured you were in the army. - I don't mean to be rude, but can we talk about something else? - Of course, I'm sorry. I didn't mean to pry. - Oh no, of course you didn't. It's just that I'm tired and I get a little touchy about the war. - Oh I understand. Hey, why don't you just lay back and relax. I'll wake you up when we get to the first gas station. - Well another time I'd be more chivalrous, but this time I think I'll take up your offer. How long have I been asleep? - Couple of hours. Feel better? - Um hmm. Much. Where are we? - We're at a motel. I got tired of driving and I know you need some more sleep. I thought we'd stop over and get a fresh start in the morning. - Right now a couple of clean sheets and a shower sounds too good to pass up. One room or two? - We've spent half the night together. It'd be a shame to waste the other half. Promise to not run away if I go take a shower? - I'd like a room. - Hour, day, week, month? - Week. - That'll be $12.50. - Sign outside says $1.50 a day. - That's right. That's for permanents. $12.50 a week. Includes maid service. Absolute privacy. You know what I mean? Eh Captain? Door six. 2nd on the left. Eh, use the elevator. Hello? Who? Mr. Shank, phone. So I asked who it was. - Who was it? - One of them places you applied for a job. An advertising outfit. Got a good address. So I asked him. He says it pays a hundred and a half to start, five days, you got Saturdays and Sundays off. - So did I take the job? - Yeah, well I was curious. So sue me. - Right, right. Well we can get it set up for tomorrow. It's no problem. Well come right in. Yeah okay, I'll call you tomorrow morning. Thank you very much. Well hello. Your name is Greg. Greg Shank. Well sit down. - Over here by me. How much of it do you know or should we start from the top? I think the bottom might be a little more accurate phrase. Did you get paid like the rest of the cast? - I did. And between deductions and expenses I have just enough left to take a teacher to dinner. - Okay, but we find a place that's easy on the budget. - Oh, you got a deal. - Thank you Greg. It was a lovely evening. - It isn't over. - No Greg, not now. Not yet. Let us be sure of what we have first. Let me be sure. A little time. We have lots of that. - I hope you're right. - Goodnight. ♫ I know a land I'll take you there ♫ A land for two that we can share ♫ And in this land I promise you ♫ The dreams you dream will all come true ♫ Love land ♫ Just open your heart to me ♫ And you'll be ♫ There ♫ This land has rain and sunshine too ♫ They make you grow, it's up to you ♫ There are no rules ♫ Except to give ♫ The more we do, the more we live ♫ Love land ♫ The best place on Earth to be ♫ Come with me ♫ There - Shank I wanna see you. You've got five minutes to clear out of here. - What's the matter here? - Don't give me that god damn innocent crap. You god damn animal, I found out who you are and what you are. - Wait a minute, Harry. - Don't call me Harry. It's Mr. Kane to you and now you only have four minutes. - Alright Mr. Kane, I've already had my trial once and I was found innocent. - You're wasting my time. I want you outta here and as soon as I find out what sewer you're in I'll mail you a check. Go ahead big man, show me how you did it. - What's wrong Greg? You've been everywhere but here tonight. - Well I may as well tell you. You'll find out tomorrow anyway. I was fired tonight. - Why? I mean, Harry likes you. - Not anymore he doesn't. - Greg, what's happened? - He found out who I am. - Who are you? May as well tell you the whole story before somebody else does. I'm surprised that it didn't happen sooner. - Gregory Shank will you stop being so exasperating? Gregory Shank, oh my god. - Hello honey. Lonesome? Troubles honey? - Look, I'm broke, I'm miserable, I have a wife and seven kids who I've beat. I like young, pretty girls. - Okay smart ass. You're probably a fag anyway. - Yes sir, can I help you? - Yes, fill it up with regular please. Hey, I thought you looked familiar. You're Captain Shank. I'm Duke Morgan, City Press. You remember me, I covered the trial. Any trouble? - This gentleman has me confused with somebody else. - I'm not confused. I saw this guy every day for four months during the trial. What about a follow up story Shank? - Shank? You mean the army captain? One and the same. - Well Havi, take care of yourself. - Yeah, sure Mr. Shank. And you do likewise. I hope you find what you're looking for. - I'm gonna try. - You know, you're an alright guy. Not many take the time to be civil, especially to some desk jockey in some run down flea bag like this. But you, you're a real gentleman. Will you shake hands? - With pleasure. - I'll take it. - You want to do it? - I don't think I'm up to it. Come on baby, good. - Thanks but, I think I'd rather do some thinking. Maybe some other time. - There ain't no other time. Sable is here now man. He won't get up with me. Come on Mitch! Get him, get him! - And anybody else? ♫ Yeah baby - Easy babe, there's no hassle man. All we wanna do is rap. - You better rap from there. - They're gonna tell you man, you're something else. I mean the way you put the leader down. - Yeah you wanna piece of it man? - No man, you don't understand. We wanna ride with you. - Ride with me? - Yeah baby. I was getting ready to split from these people anyway. I kinda like your style. Well, what about it? - I don't even know where I'm going. - Neither do we man. Like the man said, four heads even better than one. Like this. - Oh yeah. - Come on babe. I gotta get a hold of that little Philly. Don't hold me back man. Yahoo. - Hi, I'm Kathy. I seem to have run out of cigarettes and everybody else is asleep. - I'm Greg and it'd be a pleasure. I lied. - About what? - About the cigarettes. I have plenty. Well you beat me by about a minute. I was gonna use the cigarette bit myself. - I've been staring at you all evening. I guess you haven't noticed. I was pretty subtle. - I've been staring at you too. You don't seem to belong with that group. - Like you? You remind me of someone. A boy. I guess it's not very flattering. - Oh no, no, go on. I'd like to hear. - It's not an unusual story. The boy next door, high school parties. We were never really apart. Until the war. He enlisted. At first there were some letters. And then nothing. And then came a telegram. He was killed in the first action. - Many men are killed in the war Kathy. Others are killed by it. - What do you mean by it Greg? - My name is Shank. Captain Gregory Shank. - The one that... - Yeah, the one, the killer, Captain Gregory Shank, murderer. I don't believe that Greg. Hey you guys go ahead and get us a table. I'll get us some chow, okay? - I didn't know Tex had enough money to pay for this. - He's always holding something out. - Well with this and the gas we're almost tap city. - So what do we do leader man? - Hey, we've got enough money for a pad and the night, why don't we just do it? Then we go from here. - We'll do it this way. Kathy take what bread we have and get us a cheap motel for the night. I'll hustle up a job of some kind. The rest of you do the same. - I know Ivan, promise him anything. Just get him outside in the alley. Got it? - Hiya baby. Where'd you come from? That's funny, I haven't noticed you. I got a little place, just a little ways down the road. Okay? Bartender. Please, please! Anything you want, please don't hit me anymore! Get the watch off him. - Oh Christ. - Of all the idiotic stunts. - Hey man we didn't think it was gonna turn out like it did. - Yeah, that's right. You didn't think. Well forget the excuses. We gotta get the hell outta here. Jody, get the stuff together will ya? Kathy, give her a hand. Come on people, move it. - Let's leave. Let's get out. Before it's too late. - It's too late now. That's what choice do I have. Look Kathy, there's no way you're gonna be involved in this thing. We should just take off, like we never met. Forget about the whole thing. - Ask me to forget to breathe. Or laugh, or love. - Are you sure, because if you come with us, there's no turning back. - I have no choice either. Without you there's nothing, nothing to turn back to. I wouldn't go. - Alright, you got it? Into town, get the supplies, and whatever you do don't attract any attention. I'll meet you at the glen later. - Can we be of service ladies? - That's cool bitch. I like 'em to fight. - Stop, please don't. Please. - Tell me how it feels. Tell me how good it feels. Tell me slut. - What the hell's the matter with you.

Put your hands on the car. Come on. Let's go. And ladies, I want you to stand right there. Come on, off your bikes. - Man, what the hell is this?

I want these bastards and I want 'em bad. Now this area here'll be covered by the Mexican police. I want our own road blocks well within our own borders. And I want everything that crosses that border checked. Now Chief, you assign the shifts and you coordinate through this office. - Morg? - Yeah. This just came in over the teletype. - Well that just about ties it up. Now we've not only got a bunch of dope headed hippies, but they're being lead by a convicted killer. A what? - A killer. Captain Gregory Shank. Late of the U.S. Army. Roger, all units frequency five stand by. - Howdy. You fellas lost? - We're not lost pal. We've got just what we want. Now you. - You put that knife away or I'll finish what we started at the border. - Oh come on man, I was just trying to shake him up a little to keep him in line. - Put it away! I'm sorry ma'am. We're just gonna spend the night. We'll be outta here first thing in the morning. You cooperate with us, nobody'll get hurt. - Will we make it to Mexico Greg? - Well of course we will honey. You gotta believe that. - I do babe, if you say it. Tomorrow Greg. Tomorrow we'll be free. - Tomorrow Kathy, we'll be in Shangri-La. - The land of plenty. Where people never get old.

You're trying to get somebody killed? - Just a couple coons. - Longbar, you get your tail in that car and get to the road block. I'm gonna try to talk 'em outta there and I don't want you around while I'm trying to do it. - Well boss? Where do we go from here? - The same place we started for. The Mexican border. - But how do you plan to get through that mob out there? - Inside the house, this is the Sheriff. Now let the Taylors go and come outta there with your hands up. - We haven't got a chance. - We haven't got a choice. It's either that or somebody gets killed. And that's not gonna happen. - Shank? Listen to me. The officer isn't dead. Quit now while ya can. Let the Taylors go and throw down those weapons. You're not gonna solve anything by running. - Sheriff! We're coming out with the Taylors. But not your way. I don't wanna see anybody hurt, but don't try to stop us. Now you hold it right there. I told you not to move. - Give it up Shank. I talked to your father and I believe what he had to say. Now they've scheduled a rehearing. There's a chance for an acquittal. - You're a liar Sheriff. - No I'm not son. Now you can't change what's happened, but you can start over. - It's too late. Now stay back and nobody gets hurt. - Should we cover the back? - No. I'll give him a little time. A little time to think. Maybe we can do this the easy way. - Who did it? Who killed him? - I did. He hurt my little girl. And I killed him. - You bastard. - Phino died a long time ago man. He just came here to be buried. - But he was my friend! - He was nobody's friend! He used you. Like he used everyone else. Now give me the gun. - Phino! - Mr. Taylor, take your family and get 'em over in the corner. We're gonna bust outta here! - What now Morg? - Ah, we'll play it their way. Stay behind the car, nobody moves, and nobody tries to stop 'em. He's gonna run. Hold it! We head for the road block. We'll trail 'em in from this side. Unit one to Longbar. Unit one to Longbar. Apprehend gang at roadblock. But do not fire. Repeat, do not fire. I'm in pursuit and the hostages are safe. - Ready Commandante? - Si. - I think I hear 'em coming. - Fuck you! - I guess we showed them god damn hippies didn't we Commandante? Si amigo. - What the hell did you shoot for? What the hell did you shoot for? You son of a. Gentlemen, I ask that you take one final and complete look at the evidence. That a massacre did occur, we do not deny. That someone gave orders that the village be leveled, we do not deny. That civilians, women and children, were killed, we do not deny. But we do and with great conviction, deny that Captain Shank gave those orders. We further deny that he was anywhere near the village when those orders were carried out. - Had to be a hard head, didn't ya? You had to run.
