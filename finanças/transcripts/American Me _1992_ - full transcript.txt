Ain't nobody talking when I'm talking, fellows, so shut the fuck up! The following items you place in the envelope as I call them off. An empty wallet. Legal paperwork. First three out of the tank. Line up single file along the bench. Let"s go. Open your mouth. Stick out your tongue. All right. Do your ears. One at a time. Okay, bend your heads over, shake them out with your fingers. Put your hands above your head. Hands out in front of you. Over. Move those fingers. Reach down and lift up your nut sack. Drop your nut sacks, and skin back your dick. Turn around. One foot at a time, pick it up and wiggle the toes. Other foot. Bend over, grab your ass, spread your cheeks and give me two good coughs. Stand right there. J ULIE: You"re like two people. Inmate Montoya Santana? One is like a kid. Doesn't know how to dance. Step this way. Doesn't know how to make love. That's the one I cared about. Step inside. But the other one... The other one I hate. The one who knows, the one who has his rap down, who knows how to run drugs. Who kills people! Until now, I would"ve thought it a sign of weakness to even listen to what you said to me that night. But I see that you were right. I am two people. One was born when I met you. The other one began in a downtown L.A. tattoo parlor. My father, Pedro, was showing his love for my mother, Esperanza. Por Vida. For life. My mother was a beautiful woman. They were pachucos, zoot-suiters, and proud of it. In June of 1943 America was at war. Not only overseas, but with itself. The racial tension was running high against anyone that was different. Excuse me! Esperanza! Is it new? For me, esa, put together with a lot of love! Y eah, esa. Vamonos. MAN ON RADIO: Take note congressmen and senators, we don't need a third front. Read all about it! Get your paper. Come on. Come on, let's get out of here. Let"s bring our boys home to fight those zoot-suited dandies that are making it unsafe to walk our streets today. Last night in Detroit six people were killed and many injured when army, navy and marines clashed with zoot-suited thugs. Stores and property were destroyed. Riots have been reported throughout our country. Come on, guys, you don't want to start any trouble. Get your late Times. Hey, it's time to be moving, ladies. Let's get Pedro and get over to the dance and off of these streets. De volada. On the night of the Zoot Suit Riots, Pedro and Esperanza had a date. Hey, let's see the finished product, hombre. You're gonna like it, esa. Now you'll always be a part of me. Chingao! Este vato's a fine artist, ese. It's beautiful! Ã“rale. And so is the price. Hey, we better be hatting, ese. The streets are hot, hombre. If you got a problem being on the streets wearing your colors... Oh yeah, between the Hearst newspapers and Walter Winchell on the radio, you'd think the pinche war was right here in L.A., hombre. It's getting hot all over America, carnal. I'm grooving with my woman down the boulevard. She's so fine. My ruca's all mine. No telling what time I may get home 'cause I'm here. Say that fast three times, ese. Let him go. Leave him alone! Leave him alone! No! Leave him alone! Esperanza! No! No! Don't let go! God damn, no! Stop! Esperanza, Esperanza! No! Pedro! Pedro! Esperanza! Come on over here. No! Come on, get out of here! Let's give him a haircut. Esperanza! Don't touch me! Break it up! No! Esperanza! Esperanza! Esperanza! Esperanza! Esperanza! Zoot suit, new suit. It sounded all the same. I had no clue what they"d been through. It was a mystery. But to be 16 in '59, staying away from home even if I didn't have a dime, 'cause the old man was just waiting to give me his piece of time, drove me to the street just to save my mind. What's happening? Don't forget the spark plug, homes. I'll see you guys later. What's up? Hey, chico? Santana. Hey, chico, I'm not gonna make it, all right, homes? I'm gonna go eat. Later.

Paulito, how're you doing? Turn that thing off. You know what "off" means? It was easy to blame my father for everything I did. Isn't that the life of every kid? Shit. Took me a long time to understand that rhyme. J. D. Hey, come on, J. D. What are we gonna do about Mundo? He's young, he's weak. But I think we ought to let him in, show him the way, you know?

Ended up in juvie hall. And the shit got even deeper. To the right. Open up your mouth. Okay, pick your clothes up. Take it on down to the property room to exchange your clothing.

Damn you, you fucking asshole! Kill him! Kill him. Killing that first night got me the worst that juvie had to offer. An extended sentence with a guaranteed bus ride to the big time as soon as I turned 18. But the respect I earned made me think I'd found the answer. When J. D. showed up a year later, I knew we"d get even stronger. Hey, man, what's your name? Hey! Where you from? La Primera. East Los. You talk like a fucking chicon, man. I'll check you out later.

Trying to get it together, but we got a little problem. We spent all of our time trying to get it together. Dealing with whites and the mayates, only to be dealing with our own. Ã“rale, carnal. These aren't our own people. They're nothing but lame farmers from up north. They're chicanos. It's too late, homes. They're already too big in Vacaville. And now they're making a play on our shit in Folsom. They gotta pay the bill, ese. Who's carrying all the weight for them? Dude named El Chucko PeÃ±a. I know that vato. I know him real well. That should make it easier to get next to him, ese. He used to be my crime partner! What the fuck is wrong with you, ese? It's cool. Pie Face had left me only one choice. The strength of a gesture, a thought but no voice. Baby, do you understand me now? Sometimes I feel a little mad Don"t you know that no one alive can always be an angel When things go wrong I"m just a soul whose intentions are good Please don't let me be misunderstood Baby, sometimes I'm so carefree Ã“rale.

He's not no punk or nothing, but... He's not talking to you. There's something I want you to understand, Little Puppet. What happened to Pie Face, I didn't like it, but it was necessary. Especially right now. Take a look over there, ese. El Chucko and La N uestra Familia's making their play to get respect, ese. La eMe took a long time earning their respect in this place. And if we want to keep it, we gotta show some class. Now I know Pie Face wasn't weak, ese. And you know he wasn't weak, either. But how about other people? How about El Chucko, what'd he think, ese? "Cause that"s what it"s about. It"s not just about being weak that we can"t accept. It"s about other people even beginning to think we"re showing weakness. It"s up to you, you know? Don"t try to serve a summons on me! I'll do it. Get down! Get down! I said get down! Wipe your face. I got him, ese. I got the vato. You're bleeding, carnal. Hey, the dude had a filero.

You never stop to think of what life has meant till reality hits hard. You ride behind pride, thinking you can hide feelings deep within you.

I can see where we can move out here, man. Check that shit out. It's nothing new. It's the numbers that are different, brother. We're talking about 200, 000 tecatos doing their thing every day, brother. The Italians are still running the show, but they're getting sloppy. It's a move with a heavy upside. Running that show on the inside's one thing. Running it out here is a different trip. Inside and outside go together, brother. You're the one who pulled our coats to that.

Before, you know, before if somebody wanted something from you like cigarettes or your manhood and they were stronger than you, they just took it. We changed all that. We made it better for our people in the joint. But you never finished school. But I fed myself. H istory, politics, biography. Anything I could get a hold of.

We're gonna put some salsa in it so it'll taste better. Okay, Grandma. J U LI E: Why does he listen to you? He never listens to me. Neto! Neto, come and eat, please. Neto, come and eat. The food's getting cold, hurry. What are you doing? I'm making a burrito. Come on, Neto. Look at the mess! MICO: That's why you're here, to clean it up. Neto? You're dropping it all in the plate. I'll scoop it back up. Neto. Neto? Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Mama! Call an ambulance! Get Mico out of here! Come on, Neto, wake up! MICO: Neto! Damn you! What did you do, you stupid shit! Wake up! Neto! You better wake up, God damn you! Wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Damn you! Wake up! Let me see! No, Mico, no! Let me just see. He's my uncle. No! It started happening around 7: 00 tonight as soon as the new stuff hit town. How many O. D.s? Thirty, 40, maybe more. That's just the first ones we know about. It's all over town, ese. Scagnelli let the shit run through uncut. H undred percent pure. Every tecato's dream come true. Don't make no sense, carnal. It makes a lot of sense. He must have known what would happen. He's killing off his own customers. How many Italians O. D. 'd? Italians? There ain't no fucking Italians in East L.A. What are you doing? Those are Paulito's things. Where is he? I don't know. What kind of shit is he on? I don't know. Where is he? He don't listen to me, just like you. Where is he? Get your hands off me. Listen to me, where is he? Don't touch me. I said, where is he? Let me go! Where is he? Where is he? Talk to me, where is he? What are you guys doing? Let go! What kind of shit are you on? What you talking about? I'm clean, man. Paulito told me you've been coming here every day. About the other night, I... Forget it. Whatever I did to you or to Mama to make you hate me, I'm sorry. Your mother was a beautiful woman. She made me feel proud. She was 19 years old. Raped by sailors. After it happened we never talked about it. Then we got married and we tried to forget. When you were born I tried to love you. But every time I looked at you I wondered who your real father was. I wondered which sailor's blood you carried inside you. Stop. Hey, what"re they, football uniforms? Certainly not, they"re space suits. Hey, Les, don't I look like a piece of bubble-gum? Step on it again, homes. J. D. wants a good count. It's gotta be right. Our name's going out behind this. Makes me nervous looking at all this shit and not being able to chip a little taste, brother. Business, Tin Man, then we'll think about taking a little off the top. Now we're talking, brother. Watch out, homes. Ã“rale, homes! Relax, homes. He's gonna get fired. I'm just watching the tube. What happened to Abbott and Costello? They're on their way to Mars. They ain't the only ones. Drop the gun! Now! Back up against the wall! Who the fuck are you? Down on your knees, put your hands behind your back. Now! Bow your heads! Do it! You know who we are? You know who we are? Yeah, I know who you are. Now breathe! Deep! Breathe! Breathe, real deep. The word is, it was the Black Guerrilla Family. Scagnelli had his people check out how things work in here. Farmed it out to the B. G. F. What the hell are the mayates doing with the Italians? Scagnelli hooked up with the Compton dope exchange. B. G. F. runs muscle for Compton. I hear our lawyers are getting some of our people dates, huh? Yeah, Puppet and Little Puppet gonna see daylight real soon. Little Puppet in about three weeks, Puppet in about seven. Little Puppet wants to get married on the day he gets out, eh? He wants me to be best man. QuÃ¨ vato. Santana, watch your back. If we show weakness now, homes, everybody's gonna see it. Not just the mayates and wops, but the N uestra Familia as well. They're just waiting to make their fucking move. There's a way we can do it clean. Do what Scagnelli did. Farm the shit out. To who? Aryan Brotherhood. They hate the mayates. Mayates hate them. Ain't no big fucking thing. Let the A. B. give the blacks the message. That way we don't have to risk anything. We're spending all of our time dealing with the Italians and now with the Black Guerrilla Family, ese, instead of getting our people out and keeping them out. You know what? If we don't fight for this shit now, we're gonna lose it all now, homes. I also want to take a minute to thank the owner of the club, Maynard. Let"s have a good time. Let"s party! Get down! Back, motherfucker. We don't need no trouble. J ust take the money... Everybody, shut up! Get down! What is your name? Arthur J. Now it's Mrs. J. For weeks I wanted to tell you how I felt. But when I was finally with you, I couldn"t find the courage. This is how I always imagined it. The only thing, I wish my brother was here. When he comes out, let's have a party for him. I want to have a party, a big party. Ã“rale. Lourdes, this dude and my brother, man, are the only reasons I made it. You know, without them... I can't believe we're out here, ese. We made it, que no? Yeah, we made it. Let's get a drink, que no? Yeah. LITTLE PU PPET: Day in, day out. Same fucking thing. You know what it was in there, homes? Dead time, wasting my fucking life away, ese. And for what? So I could look in the fucking mirror and say, "You're bad, ese. You're bad." Shit, homes, the best tattoos in East L.A. Now I can't draw shit, ese. Fuck it, homes. It's okay. I'm lucky, huh? I can still do something. Go sit him down. Hey, you know, I'm here, ese. Ã“rale. You know what? I don't need to be bad anymore. What you laughing at, punk? Wipe that fucking smile off your face, asshole. Hey, carnal. Wedding present, man. Chale, ese. Be cool, man. Be cool? Ã“rale, I don't need to be cool. Â¿Sabes quÃ¨? I'm married now. Ã“rale. You're cool. What went down in Compton was wrong, ese. It was supposed to be business. It came out racial. We wanted to send a message to the B. G. F. about staying away from our business and we send a bunch of fucking cowboys into other people's home turf, talking trash and shooting some guy in the dick. I don't know what's wrong with you. I don't know if it's that woman or what. But you're starting to show weakness and we both know that you can't do that. Get away, damn it, your breath smells like goat shit. J U LI E: Oh, shit, come on, Little Puppet. Come on, prlmo, get up. You all right? Come on, guy. Time for you to take a walk. Come on. You okay? My cousin, man, she a fox or what? Hey, Santana, I don't want to be in the La eMe anymore, ese. I wanna be a John Doe, tÃº sabes, you know? Sears and Roebuck all the way, homes. Work for a living. Move to Bakersfield. Have some fucking kids, ese. Excuse me. Oh, man. Oh, I feel better now, except I'm fucking hot. Take it easy, nobody wants to see you naked, all right? Okay, homes. I'm gonna go wash up a little, all right? Wait up, I'll go with you. Oh, no, that's okay. J ulie, I'm sorry, huh? It's okay. You're my cousin, remember? Fox is my cousin, que no, ese? I'm sorry to hear about Neto. I don't know what to say to you. Whatever, you know. You're like two people. One is like a kid. Doesn't know how to dance. Doesn't know how to make love. That's the one I cared about. But the other one... The other one I hate. The one who knows, the one who has his rap down, who knows how to run drugs. Who kills people! I don't have to listen to this shit, all right? If you were a man, I'd... You'd kill me. Oh, no. No, you'd fuck me in the ass, right? Right? I guess we got nothing to say to each other. You know, when I met you, I was impressed. Yeah, you talked about la raza and education and the revolution, but you know what, man? You really don't care about any revolution, do you? You're nothing but a fucking dope dealer. J ust a road to where we're going, esa. Bullshit! Â¿Sabes quÃ¨? I don't do drugs. I don't even like them, but they're there. It's a reality. If I don't take care of that business, somebody else will. Yeah? Well, your business kills kids, man. It kills kids! Like Neto and Paulito and Mico, my son, who look up to you. They idolize the ground you walk on. What the fuck do you want from me? Do you want me to start over? Get a job? How about become a citizen? There's no fucking hope for our kids, for our barrios, with people like you around. Good evening, buses stopped running at midnight. Is everything okay? Yeah, what's the problem? You ever been in the joint? Yeah. What about you, miss? No. We weren't doing anything wrong. Can I see some I. D.? This your jacket? Any weapons? Okay, step to the car. Put your hands on the hood. Now! He wasn't doing... Stay out of this, ma'am. She's just a chick I picked up at a party. Come on, he wasn't... Stay back! Step away from the car and put your hands on top of your head. Hands out in front. Over. Wiggle the fingers. Reach down and lift up your nut sack. Can I talk to you a minute? SimÃ²n, ese. I heard about what happened. I'm sorry, Santana. Mi carnalito, he messed up. It wasn't his fault, ese. It was an all-American beef. When they wanna pop you, they're gonna pop you. Want some grilled cheese, ese? No, thanks. You sure, ese? People are saying it's Little Puppet's fault. It wasn't his fault, ese. You know me, carnal. I'll do anything for La eMe, anything! But I'm asking you, please, take my brother's name off. Your brother's name's on a piece of paper, ese. They want me to kill him. It's a mistake, ese. Don't worry about it. I'll take care of it. Nothing's gonna happen to your brother. That's good to hear, ese. That's good to hear. I hear Little Puppet's name's on a piece of paper, ese. I want you to co-sign it. I'm taking it off, ese. That punk got you kicked back in the hole. Set us all back. Now he's running around talking about how he wants out of La eMe. H is number's up, homes. I said I'm taking it off, ese. What's gonna happen is gonna happen. Don't try to stop it. You understand me? I'm asking you, carnal. Is that where it's gotten to, ese? The brothers are talking about you. What are they saying, ese? They're saying that you're not showing them anything. You know, a long time ago, two best homeboys, two kids were thrown into juvie. They were scared, and they thought they had to do something to prove themselves. And they did what they had to do. They thought they were doing it to gain respect for their people, to show the world that no one could take their class from them. No one had to take it from us, ese. Whatever we had, we gave it away. Take care of yourself, carnal. But it's looking good as far as the appeal is concerned. I'd say maybe in the next six months, but it's gonna be tough. Puppet. Ã“rale, Mundo. What's the word, mockingbird? Gonna fly the coop on us? SimÃ²n. You gonna take care of that business for us, right? You brought your brother in. You gotta take him out. Santana was gonna talk to J. D. Come on, don't punk out on us, ese. If you can't take care of it, we will. Anybody that happens to be with him gets to go along for the ride. One-two-three, five! One-two-three, six! One-two-three, seven! Dear Julie, maybe the reason I learned how to read and write was so that I could write you this letter. Here in this cage, behind these bars, I can read, I can learn. I can even make love, but it's distorted. I thought that what I had learned on the inside was everything I needed to know, even on the outside. Like they say, things don"t always turn out the way one feels they should. Till now, all the books I've ever read have been to try to get power. J U LI E: Let's see. Mico, help me find my shoe. MICO: Yeah? You'd lose your head if it wasn't fastened on. You were the door to another life, where my seed might have been affirmed. Ta-da! I found your shoe! I"ve brought back to this hole a breath of life, which I am trying to use. We make it, carnal. We don"t fake you, we just take you. "Cause La Primera"s ese. Always has been, always will be. Ã“rale. Ã“rale. Welcome to the clica, carnal. Por vida, ese. Por vida. Are you coming out, ese? Staying in. Are you sure you know what you're doing, ese? SimÃ²n. You scared me by showing me a glimpse of what my life might have been. That's Lourdes. Ã“rale. Hey, be careful! Don't worry, homes, I ain't gonna crash. Check that one out. See all the people? They were throwing rice and shit. Look at Mama. Pull over up here. I gotta take a leak. This medal I send to you as a gift for helping me find my voice, a key to my soul which I will use. St. Dismas is the patron saint of all those in prison. He has protected me. May he do the same for you. Have hope. You deserve it. PAULITO: La Primera lives, ese. It lives through us. It gives to us. It is us. SimÃ²n, ese, it's all we got. It's all we've ever had. Carnal, remember that time we went down to the L.A. River? We drank that funky, funky wine, ese. Man, I was sick for a week. You wanna know what Lourdes asked me? I'm telling you this 'cause you're my carnal. She wanted to know if the reason why they call me "Little Puppet" was... You know. Made me real angry. I think she's pregnant now. I guess I showed her, huh? Don't look at me! Don't look at me. Don't fight. Please, don't fight! J ust die! J ust die. Mi carnalito. God damn me. Coming out? Paulito. Can I talk to you for a minute? Your brother sent this for you. He wants you to have it. You know what it is, right? Yeah. Yeah, I went with my mom to give it to him, years ago. Thanks. Ã“rale. Hey, check it out! Look at what my carnal sent me. Mommy, where're you going? To school, Mico. To school? Give me a kiss. I love you. Is it okay if I go with the guys? No, it's not okay. MICO: Why not? J U LI E: Because I said so. Please? No, you can't. PAU LITO: Looks good, don't it? You're a man now, ese. PAU LITO: Let's go cruise the boulevard. Paulito. Be right back! Paulito! Paulito! Papa, I'll be right back. You coming out, ese? Yeah. You got a lot of heart, carnal. Maybe too much. You've always gotta give it your best shot, you know? Which one, ese? Don't matter. Fuck it, homes. La Primera lives! What is time? Time is when a man is tryin" to make time with your woman, but you doin" time behind bars and your time is standin' still. Yo, Frost, kick it to these people for real. Kl D FROST: Time slips through the hourglass Through night and day And I watch as the games people play It's like do unto others, then split And if you can"t back up what you say then you ain"t shit I"ve seen the manifestations of the street So I can manifest what I see on a drumbeat Like just last night What happened, man? I watched these two vatos get in a crazy fight One of them was quick to pull a knife He stabbed him in the heart And now he's doin' life in prison at the age of 21 Livin' on death row "cause he couldn"t let go Caught in the web of violence Row deep when they creep And move in silence of the lambs Yo. A tattooed teardrop as the iron gates slam Ain't no sunshine Any time, hey Ain't no sunshine Damn, damn, ain't that a shame? You"re lost so pay the cost Shouldn't have played the game Should've listened to the Frost When I was tryin" to come across to ya But no, you didn"t think Sucker. You just keep gettin" yourself more deep Until you sink So there's no one else to thank but yourself So go ahead and take a bow for a job well done But you"II never see the day of the sunshine Or the fun times Just the old days and your old ways True. Corrupt and wicked Out there doin' dirt instead of just kickin" it Pow-pow bang-bang and all that noise Yeah, you and all your homeboys You take time to read between the lines 'Cause ain't no sunshine Ain't no sunshine Any time, hey Ain't no sunshine Yo, kick it. I know about bein" macho Callin' the shots, the big time head honcho But here's somethin' even more gacho One of my homeboys is your old lady Sancha Yo, shit happens Her number lights up on his beeper Right as I"m rappin" While you sit in your cell writin' a letter Sayin' when you get out Yo, things"II be better But, man, she couldn't wait So she's goin' out on dates with every Tom, Dick and Harry And if you ask me, yo, shit"s gettin" scary So how you gonna handle this When your ho"s in Los Angeles actin' so scandalous Yo, you can"t blame her you didn"t take the time And now ain"t no sunshine Ain't no sunshine Just for you in "92. You know what I"m sayin"? Ain't no sunshine So if you don't want to do no time, you better take time and try to draw the line. Or you're gonna be the next fool in line doin' time. You know what I"m sayin"? Like my man said. Ain't no sunshine, fool. Ain"t nothin" happenin" up there. You know what I"m sayin"? Yo, me and Frost is outta here.
