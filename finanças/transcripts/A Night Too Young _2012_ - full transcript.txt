What's going on? Nothing. Do you want to go home right away, when we're in town? We were together for two days. That should be enough. I don't have to go right away. Yes, you can hang out with Štepán. What? Will he be there the whole time? I won't get rid of a friend. I thought we'd have some time together. Good day, your ticket please. It's in the compartment. A Night Too Young Hello. It's me. Come down. I'm not allowed. Hurry up. It's starting soon. Wait. I'll try again. Dad, I'm going outside. Just for a bit. You're staying here. - Papa? - Stop bugging me. Are you coming? Hello. Are you there? You got a string? - No. - No. No. - No. - No. Okay. She's not wearing a bra under her t-shirt. - You're kidding. - No. Really. You see everything. - Everything? - Everything! - Balog says, it makes for a good wank. - What? If he thinks about it, he comes. What? Why, it's white and sticky. How do you know? I've touched it. Are you gay or what? They've all touched it. Nonsense. No one but you. Piss off. You're feeling up Balog by the cock! - You're a fuck wad. - And you're an old fagot. - Pig! - But you're sucking Balog's cock. - Take that back or I spit. - Not! Yes. Yes, okay. I take it back. It is certainly better like this. That's good. Come down. What a descend. Really cool. What happened to you? Everything okay? Come on, get up. Where's my sled? Give it back! - Haven't we met? - Yes. - Good day. - Hello. Would you do me a favor? Do you see that house? - Yes. - I live there. Do you know the pub? They won't sell them anything. We go ourselves. And never come back. Here you have money. Do us a favor and get a liter of vodka from the pub? Yes. Would that work? - It's New Year's Eve. - That was yesterday. All the better. - What's your name? - Baluška. I'll write Mrs Baluška, so you don't have to lie. 4th floor. Don't run of with the dough. Yes. So go ahead. Let's go. - Good day. - Hello. Your mom wants a bottle of vodka? Yes, mom. Mom wants a liter of vodka? She's a teacher. Oh man, vodka for a teacher. Franta, you should sell them that. Nonsense. That's complete poppycock. Put it on my tab, if you're scared. - What do you mean, scared? - Yes, scared! Come over to the table. You got dough? Okay, a liter of vodka makes 300. - A beer for Franta, right? - Sure. Rum? Three glasses. Okay, three rum. - Does mom, the teacher, smoke? - Yes. Just look! Because you broach the subject "moral". I mean, if you talk about archetypal quintessence, the existence of life. Then we can't do without... some fundamental philosophical considerations. Yes, and this reminds me... that over 20 years ago... Let's go out. Why? We go to the pub. Without her. - She'll be pissed off. - Nonsense. When she wakes up, we're already gone. Come on. I'm staying here. Then I go alone. Wait, what am I doing here without you? Whatever you want? - She wouldn't want me here alone. - Why not? What can she do when I'm not there? Do you think she's sitting here feeling sorry? You like her, right? Yes. Yes? Well then. I'm out of here. Wait. Are you coming or not? Okay. Are you deaf? - Hello, come in. - Good day. Leave the sled outside. Hi. Did you get it? - Great! - Come. I'll change. I'll be right back. - You got any dough left? - No, we bought cigarettes. David, invite them in. - You even got cigarettes? - Yes. That's funny. A man bought it for us. And you thought they wouldn't get anything. Do you want tea? Why not give them twenty and goodbye. Do you want tea or go home right away? Tea. - Cheers. - To the New Year. Sit down. What do we do with them here? I don't know. They can booze with us. Very well. Wait! You know what, boys? Here, you can keep the change. They already had a tip at the pub. That's not why. Go home now. You're not at home here. You're a guest here like them. Yes. But at least I'm over 18. Boys, do you want something to eat? But I need help. I'm coming. How did you do that? It's spitting fire on you. How did you do that? First I half kill you. Then head off or backbone out. Or spit fire on you. I want a go. Can I try? I want to spit fire too. - Who's doing that? - The fat one. First kill half, then press "fatality". Can you show me? You have no chance. You're a natural. Are you okay? Come. - Has David gone? - What? Has David gone? No idea. I really don't know. Let's hit the sack. Your arms... You feel sick as well? One... and the other. Not here. I look over there. Open up. Who's there? - A cop. - How dare you? - Why? - Apparently we're making a racket. He should leave. Don't be angry. We're having a little celebration. It's New Year's Eve, right? Happy New Year. I just don't want to have to come again. Don't worry. Do you want to have a drink with us? Are you crazy? Calm down. I have to go anyway. Or I can make you coffee. Takes only one minute. Lie down. Off to bed, but quickly. Do you hear? - Good day. - Hello. Is this your son? Yes. And what's your name? Michael Polán. - Kateřina. - Pleased to meet you. Pleased to meet you. - What are we doing with him? - Sorry, he's drunk. Me? Look at him. Enough! You're not at home here. That's a relief. I don't quite understand. Never mind. - Do you still want coffee? - Yes. Are you feeling better? I'm drinking coffee here, okay? Okay. Shall I come up? Rather watch that nothing happens outside. And then pick me up. OK? Right, understood. Such an asshole. We have to wait until your stuff is dry. Go home. Go! It's been a long time that I talked with someone. - I'm sorry. - Just keep talking. No. Rather you say something. But I don't feel like talking. New Year's eve was quiet this time. We haven't been called once. You might think we had it easy, right? Yes, I suppose. But it changed nothing. We were even more nervous. We were waiting all night for a disaster. What's worse? All the time going back and forth... with the ambulance, or this eerie calm? How did it go? Shitty. That one threw up on me. I can see that. I'm leaving. You won't leave me all alone now! Come on! I don't want to go in there anymore. Nonsense. You'll have fun. Right, you'll make sure of that? - Is anybody in there? - A policeman. A policeman? Somehow all of a sudden you stop... just being human and become... how should I say this... Good evening. Good evening. Carry on, don't mind me. Keep talking. A part of the system, right? Yes, exactly. The responsibility. Suddenly you can no longer do what you want. You have responsibility for others. Same with us at school. Are you introducing me? Can I take a seat? Or not? What? Mr. Polán came because we made a racket. We are celebrating here some... - How can I say this? - Sorry. Redress for yesterday. Where did you celebrate? In the mountains. But it went wrong. We were kicked out. Why? Štepán played with fire. Oh. And you? Where did you celebrate last night? On duty. Could you decide for yourself to work on New Year's Eve? No, it comes as it comes. But don't you have a family? Or someone to celebrate with? You don't have to answer, I'm only asking. Ah, the gentleman is back. Sit down. We're waiting for you. You're doing well without me. I'll take that with me. He hasn't digested New Year's Eve yet. Do you have to throw up again? No. Okay. Go back to bed. Okay? Careful. Everything okay? I want to go home. If you had left right away, you wouldn't feel bad now, there wouldn't be a cop in the living room... and I'd be having fun with Kateřina. Do you like her? - Are you still alive? - Yes. She's pretty. You must indeed have had a lot of fun, if they sent the vice squad right away. You were there. What was going on? - Leave the child alone. - Relax. Stop it. Didn't you hear? We stop being formal? - We're just talking. - Get lost. What's your problem? Not like that. it's annoying! - It's not to me. - Sure. Because you're having such a nice talk. So what? I brought provisions. You wanted to leave from the start. I'm begging you... You wanted to impose Štepán on me? - What are you talking about? - David, please. I thought he could keep you company. Was he the first one? You're turning me into a whore. You're doing that all on your own. You're such an asshole, David. Don't cry. - I'd better go. - No. Don't go yet. You said you'll be picked up. - Why are you stopping me? - What? Why should I stay? Why? Because you're the only one who's listening to me today. Then maybe I should go? Štepán. Štepán. Lie down over there. Come. Come. Lie down. I'll wake you up later and then you go home, okay? Lie down. Good night. Good night. - All units. - I'm listening. A message on missing persons. Two twelve year old boys... Štepán. Štepán. What, dumb-ass? Leave me alone. Don't be pissed off. You have to see this. Why is it dark in here? - Why didn't you kick him out? - Wait. She wants him. What can your do? There are always plenty of interested parties. You shouldn't care, when it's your turn. At least if you want to stay cool. Else they screw you when they want. Keep it on. Undress me. Hello, what's up? I'm still celebrating. With Štepán. Like I said. No. Sure, I'm coming. Sure, got it. Yes, me too. I love you too. Bye. You're still here? Your clothes are in the bedroom. David, wake up. Get up. David. How can you smoke in the morning? What's it to you? And, did you screw? Yeah, sure. A pity we couldn't wake you up. You could've left the bed to the boys. No tea for me? Right. What will they say at home? Pray that they won't tell on us. Are you sick? Eat a bit. It helps. I wouldn't like to be in their shoes. Sometimes I think you suck. Subtitles by Subransu
