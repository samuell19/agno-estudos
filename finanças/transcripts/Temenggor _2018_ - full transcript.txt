Nice shot! And then, I stumbled across this cute little rusa... And it was stuck to a net, somehow. And it was struggling, so it was trying to get out right... And then I knifed it! So, it's dead? No... of course not! I wouldn't kill a cute little animal! I let it go. And it was roaming free, not a care in the world... It was a beautiful sight. I wish we could spend all our days like this. But you and I both know that - Shh. Don't talk about unhappy things. It hurts me. How're we not supposed to talk about this? How can we pretend that this isn't real? It is real... It's just - I have to go. You need more practice. Remember the crane... And the musang... They are light on their feet... But deadly, when they strike. Bapak! Ahh, my child! Ibu Pamborang. Tuila. Sa'arib, my son! Tok Penghulu. Sa'arib. How blessed I am... Soon, you will be united with my dear, Tuila. Has my daughter brought you joy? Yes she has, Tok. Bapak! Why are you so embarrassed? Your mother... She stole my heart the day I saw her. She would be very proud of you. Alright, alright. Sa'arib. What reports do we have from the scouts? There is still... no news from our scouts. Our situation is dire, Tok. The crops are wilting. Our herd is not reproducing... The fish... we are unable to eat them. The village dwisari whispers... The curse of Hutan Temenggor is coming true... The curse of Hutan Temenggor... is nothing but a myth... a fairytale! It is merely the delay of the rains. Soon, everything will be alright. In time. Tok... the people are talking... especially the wives... of the unreturned... I see. The people... Gather the villagers this evening. I will address them. And restore confidence. Yes, Tok. Bang, I've something I have to attend to. I'll take my leave. Woi... Yekub, if you keep stirring the food like that we'll never have anything to eat. Bodoh! I hate my life! Yeah, your life is hopeless. How do women fall for you is a mystery... No it isn't. I just have a big cock. Yeah. One day that big cock of yours is going to get you killed. Well, what's life without a little bit of excitement? Right? Makan, Makan! Yekub? You are the most pathetic man that I know. Just look at yourself. She's never going to be yours. Maybe, not in this lifetime. She is never ever going to be yours. Asmianto. It's OK. You will never understand. Because love is not for sinners, hmm? Well, I'm happy with it. Just look at me. I'm a man, and I do manly things. I just know how to appreciate it. The spell is working Ibu. You're looking radiant and beautiful like a young maiden. If only young maidens didn't attract my husband's attention. But he's a man after all. His mind is where his cock is. I tire of the man. But he has his uses. If only it were as easy to get rid of my stepdaughter as it was her mother. My life would be so much easier. And now I have to get rid of that fool, Sa'arib. If he marries Tuila, he will be the next Penghulu... and that can never be. Maaf, Ibu. Oh, Mirna. What a waste of good blood. Fetch me another. Ibu! Look! There is a disturbance in dunya roh... A deep hunger is yearning for blood and souls. And this hunger is growing and growing... The blood reveals... It's the curse of Hutan Temenggor... It is upon us! The lands are wilting as darkness descends upon us... What did he do this time? He speaks of how I should be honored to be unified to the best warrior in the village. And Sa'arib just stood there. Like a cockerel crowing to the sun. Tuila. Is marrying Sa'arib really that bad? I don't love him... You know that... I know you don't... But, we are just humble dwisari... Our tradition calls for things like this. I know you don't want to hear this. Sooner or later, you will marry Sa'arib... and maybe, just maybe, everything will be OK. But my heart yearns for Yekub... Kak, I'll go bring you your dinner. Very well. Mirna. You have been our wise dukun. Let us hear what you have seen. Tok Penghulu. The curse of Hutan Temenggor is in motion. Our ancestors failed to fulfill a blood pact with the Great Spirits. Their retribution brings a curse over a thousand bulans. Curse? What curse? A thousand bulans? But, the ancestors speak of a ritual to break this. The prophecy tells that a sacrifice must be fulfilled before daybreak. Failure will seal our fate and we will rot with the land. A man... with strange markings... rusty amulet... blood... blood-stained hands... ancient altar at Hutan Temenggor... I see... I see... I recognize her... death... no! Altajalli... Altajalli... Altajalli... A sacrifice to cleanse our sins. What are the visions? What is Altajalli that you speak of? Altajalli is the ancient altar at Hutan Temenggor. A sacrifice. We must carry out a sacrifice to save our people. No... we cannot sacrifice... Altajalli? Leave us! Mirna. What are the visions? Tell me clearly. Tok Penghulu. I saw a young girl. I saw Tuila... and blood... on an altar. What does that mean? It means that she must be sacrificed. Lies... Lies! This cannot be! She is my only child! You... Your dabbling in the dark magic... has driven you mad! Bang, please! We have to think about it! Think about it? Think about it?! Are you as mad as this pathetic creature?! She is our most loyal dukun! We have to think about her prophecy! Mirna, I will send for you later. Leave us. Yes, Ibu. Get out of my way, mangkuk! Sorry... Kak Mirna. Eh, apasal tu? Sakit perut, ke? What took you so long, huh? He could've killed me! Kambano kambayeh sukari mamoomba so... Bang... Calm down... Calm down? How can I be calm?! That bomoh has just sent my daughter to die! We have to think about the prophecy! Kambano kambayeh sukari mamoomba so... kambano kambayeh sukari mamoomba so... Bang, I love Tuila like she is my own daughter. My heart aches to hear that she must be... sacrificed... but... our ancestors have spoken. Her sacrifice will ensure our survival. Yes... her sacrifice... she must be sacrificed... Yes. And it will save us all. And you will be remembered for your benevolence. Yes... the dwisari will remember me... Give it back to Kulu! The big, brave man is going to get it from me, is it?! Anjing! You disrespect Kulu, Kulu will kill you for your disrespect! When Abd'lla comes, this kutu will know what respect is. This sword... It's unusual... it's made from darkstone and it's... sharp enough to cut through a thick-skinned braajeet! Do you think it's true? What he said just now? The Hutan? Indeed. There's been many tales, myths and legends about the Hutan. They say at the Hutan... you'll never grow hungry... The juiciest of meats! Downed with the sweetest dreshtis! And the treasures... The shiniest of treasures! What about the virgins?! Ah yes, the virgins... The finest selection of the purest gadis dwisari! All ripe for us to... pluck! Shut it! Tok. You summoned me? Sa'arib, my son. Come. I must break both our hearts as I tell you this. Sa'arib. You who will undertake this task. Tuila must never know. When you have taken her, to the ancient Altajalli altar at Hutan Temenggor... you will sacrifice her. Her death will bring life to the pashti. There is no other way. Lest we all perish... Do you understand? But, Tok... I cannot... I know, my gah'sa... I know. This is why it must be you. You see, I am a broken man... My heart bleeds for this. Surely there must be another way! My dear Sa'arib. Do you think there could be another way? Can we ask Kak Mirna to consult the spirits again? Find another way? I do not decide the fate of our dunya. I am merely a messenger between the dunya roh and ours. What if... What if we move away from here? The curse will only follow us through all the days of our lives. If we do not do it, all will perish... And there will never be a place that we can call home. Sa'arib, my son. You see... there is no other way. I am sacrificing my own daughter. How do we weigh one life to the other? Only my ancestors can judge me in the afterlife. You see, Sa'arib. The life of a Penghulu is an honorable one. But at times like these... a lonely one. I will do as you command, Tok. Tell no one of the true nature of your journey. And when you return, you will return a hero. You who would've saved us from the plight that curses our tribe, Ker Tiga. Now go. Prepare. There must be no delay. You must make haste. The ritual must be completed before daybreak. Sa'arib. When you hear the drums... be ready. Yes, Tok. Gah'sa Sa'arib! Amutamu. How have you been holding up? I am well. But I am unsettled. Gah'sa. Sa'arib? Sa'arib. I'm sorry. You were saying? It's our scouts. None have returned. I don't know what to tell their wives and children. Our security is wearing thin. I understand. It bothers me too. But trust in our Penghulu. He leads us with wisdom and clarity. Yes, undoubtedly Gah'sa. Assure the wives that their husbands are noble dwisaris. They will return with honor. In this life or next. Yes, Gah'sa. Amutamu. I thought you should know. Tok... has tasked me with carrying out an important duty. Throughout my years... I've been through many tough decisions. This next one is not an easy one. Sa'arib, my brother. We've spilled blood together. And I've seen your spirit shine through... impossible times. Whatever it is you must do, I trust you will go with honor. There is a fine line between honor, and doing what is right. Amutamu. I will be away for awhile. I want you to keep Ker Tiga safe. Promise? I promise, Gah'sa. Psst! Oh, Merpatiku... I've something to tell you. What's happening? I don't know... They're gathering! I should go! I can almost taste the sweet treasures of Hutan Temenggor! All the riches... people will respect me! Yeah! Nobody ordering us about, huh! Nice clothes and servants doing whatever we command! We'll be the rajas of our own pashtis! I have been given a vision by the Great Spirits of our pashti. Our crops wither and our animals suffer... For we have been cast a deadly curse... The curse... of Hutan Temenggor. But... there is a way to end this plight. The spirits have spoken that a sacrifice must be made... at the ancient altar Altajalli... at the opening of the Hutan. If we do not do this, we will all die. Sa'arib, you will take this offering. However, the sacrifice must be made by one of standing. My daughter, Tuila. But Bapak, what do you mean I have to go? The spirits have spoken. My dearest Tuila. I would accompany you... but I am old and uncertainty surrounds our tribe. For this alone... my duties bind me here. But you... you are young... and brave. The journey will not be far. But, Bapak... Tuila, my dear... You're one of the few left of standing in this tribe. Your Bapak and I, we're old. And will easily tire during the journey. If you don't go, our village will die. For the sake of our people. I will go. For our people. I will go too! Tok Penghulu. All wise and merciful, Penghulu Prethip Ambu. I would like to go on this quest. I can help carry the basket and with the cooking... and take care of Tuila and Sa'arib... so that they will not be too tired when they reach the altar. I even have enough provisions for this trip. We wouldn't want them to pass out from hunger or exhaustion. After all, our lives depend on their success... And I want to make sure they succeed. Very well. Thank you, Tok Penghulu. Follow the Bintang Utara. It will then guide you to ancient Altajalli. No one must live to tell. Who is it? It's me. Come in. Can I help? I want you to know. Yes? I am sorry. It's OK. We're both troubled by our quest. Yes. Our quest... I'll wait for you at the edge of the pashti. Who is it? Only your mother, dear. I'll be out soon. Come now, let me help you pack. I'm sure you must be very worried about your journey. She would be so proud of you. Your mother. She was a very smart and lovely lady. She was like a sister to me. I thought you both didn't like each other. No. We were the best of friends. When she died, something inside of me died too. Seeing your father so sad and depressed... I always wondered what your mother would do in that situation. And that would be to marry Bapak? Of course not. She would have tried to help your father. How was I to know I would fall in love with him. And he with me. Tuila. I love you like you're my own daughter. My heart aches that you must go on this journey. But your sacrifice is just what this village needs. Without you... Without your sacrifice... All would be lost. I love you. It's almost time for you to leave. You better hurry. Please... Please don't kill me! I can make you rich! I promise! Shut up! What do you want? I can make it happen for you... Kulu wants nothing from you, you vermin! I know what you want... I can make you rich... like me... You can find it... you can find everything you want... at the Hutan... What Hutan? T-Temenggor... Where is Hutan Temenggor? I don't really know... Where is it?! Tell Kulu where or Kulu will fuck you up like your friend! Bintang Utara... Sa'arib. You've been like a brother to me. You will take care of yourself. May the eyes of the Hutan watch over you, brother. May the eyes watch over you too. Yekub. Do you know what you're doing? No... But I can't leave her alone with that orangutan. Well, Yekub my friend. You are brave. The whole village is counting on you. Don't mess this up. Yeah, thanks for the encouragement. Ilir. You are more than a friend to me. You're a sister I never had. You've always been by my side and I've never felt alone because of you. I am truly grateful. But this is a journey I must do by myself. Stay behind. And help Bapak. We have to help him, look after him, make sure nothing happens to him. Can you do that for me? Bapak. Ibu. I have requested for Ilir to be your handmaiden while I'm away. Please show her as much affection as you have shown to me. Of course, my child. Come, Ilir. You have been faithful to dearest Tuila for many years. You will be safe in our house. May the spirits of our Great Ancestors bless your travels. What happened? What happened to Kulu? Hutan Temenggor? Dump the bodies. We'll stop here! Make sure our water gourds are to the brim. I'll scout around. Did you know I would be going on this journey? That was what I was trying to tell you! Well, at least you're here. I didn't want to be alone in the forest with Sa'arib. Oh, Merpatiku... I'd rather die in the Seven Gates of Neraka than leaving you alone with that traitor! What do you mean? The sacrifice... it's not for the chickens... It's for you! How do you know this? I heard your father, Sa'arib, your stepmother and that witch talking about it in the hut. I heard everything... and there were visions. Visions of you being sacrificed on the altar! But... Bapak... Is bewitched! Your stepmother has some sort of a spell over him! I'm sorry... We have to turn back! No! No, we can't! We can't turn back! Bapak's in danger! But... but, Bapak! Look, we have to move on... Alright? Are you guys done? Coming! We can't turn back... shh... No... please! We have to kill Sa'arib! Before he kills you... Alright? We can't turn back. No! This is the only way, we can't turn back! We have to move on! Alright? What do we do? Where he is standing is very slippery. So, I want you to distract him... Hey, I want you to distract him... And I'll push him over from behind. Into the river. And hopefully the water will sweep him away. What about your daggers? I don't want to use them just yet. He has quick reflexes and I don't think I can land a killer blow so... Let's make it look like an accident. Asmianto. Amutamu. Where are you off to so late? I'm... I'm going to see adik Martana... At this hour? Yeah, I heard she's not feeling too well. I see. My apologies. May the grace of our ancestors offer her a speedy recovery. OK. Thank you. Well, you better be on your way. Malam. Oh, one more thing Asmianto. Be careful, Asmianto. There's a lot of evil around. What took you so long? I don't have all day to wait for your report! Maaf saya, Ibu. We were... delayed. I don't want your excuses! So, have you found him yet? We are still searching for the man with the amulet. You haven't captured Kulu?! He... is a slippery one! Like... orang minyak! Find him! And bring him to me, Abd'lla! I want him alive. Baik, Ibu. There's a group of three traveling to Hutan Temenggor tonight. My stepdaughter Tuila is with them. She is to be sacrificed on the altar. As for the others... Kill them. Sa'arib? I was going to ask about the chickens... Shouldn't they get to eat before they're sacrificed? At least? Clumsy idiot! Hurry up! Our success is crucial to the village! Drink this. What is this? It's a potion to make you last all night. It smells so foul! What are we going to do? We let Sa'arib walk ahead for a bit. And then you pretend to have a sprained ankle. When he comes back to check on you... I'll come from behind! And hit him in the head with a rock! Hurry up! Coming! Ahh! Sakit! What happened? I stepped on a stone... I think I hurt my ankle... Let me see. What are you doing! I was just trying to help! By lying on the floor?! We'll take her to a better place so we can check on her ankle! Carry my spear! Mortanambi mortanambi otta otta sukarani... Kulu... Let's move! What was that? I don't know. But better keep moving. You can put me down now. Are you sure? My ankle doesn't hurt anymore. No! The chickens! We don't have much time! We'll find something to sacrifice when we get to the altar! Help... me... help me... help me... Has the deed been done? Not yet, Ibu. What is taking them so long? Surely they would've arrived at the Hutan by now! They are near... Good. I can't wait for this whole thing to be over. But, there is... danger lurking nearby... All will fall into place. Just in case that fool Sa'arib fails... I will remove your gag but you will not scream or I will slit your throat before you could even finish your duas. Understand? Foolish girl! Did you think you could enter my home and steal my precious away? Ah, release the sakti to me! Your blood replenishes my soul! Bashkar neraka! You still have some fight left in you! I like that. That makes your blood all the more tastier! Pick it up. You wanted to save him, didn't you? Well here's your chance. Come. My sweet, Ilir. I want you to cut his cock off. Another maiden for my mistress. She was our only child... I know, bang. Did we do the right thing? What if it was a mistake? Bang... This was the only way. I sent my only child to die... My soul will burn in neraka for this! You are the great Penghulu Prethip Ambu who united the land and brought us peace and prosperity. You are the savior of our people. And you will be blessed a thousand fold for your sacrifice. What if we were wrong? I don't think I can live with myself. Bang... Let's go back to bed. I'd like to stay here for awhile... You... You! What are you doing here?! I felt that you needed me. Need you? Need you?! Who caused me all this grief! My heart is in agony because of you! You... sent my only child... to die! It is the fate of the dunya. Not mine. Lies. Lies! Come sit down. Calm down... Come, Mirna. Massage his shoulders. She will rub your mind clear of this uneasiness. Does that feel better? I will leave you with Mirna now. She will do all she can to help you relax and forget about all your worries. We're here. We should scout around to ensure that we're alone. Gah'sa? Tuila... Yes? Why don't you join me? Why? So that - You can kill me?! Stay back! I'm not going to let you hurt her! What do you think you're doing?! Defending the one I love! You're in love with her? And I with him. But, Tuila... I love you... Then why are you trying to sacrifice me? It is my duty. I have no choice. You do have a choice! Just let us go! And you can tell the Elders that we knocked you out. And then when you woke up, we were gone. Stay back! Stay back! Please, Sa'arib! Don't do this! Stay back! Please! Well, well, well... What do we have here... Some lost villagers on a midnight stroll? Who are you?! What business do you have here?! Our business is none of your business, boy! I'm not afraid of bandits with no honor! Hah! Honor, you say! So says the one that has little to none. I know what you're here to do, boy... I'm not into little boys... But, she... She will do just fine... Take the girl. Kill the rest! Sa'arib! No! Come! Come, little children! Not going to hurt you... Get 'em! Hey! Hey! Fool! Do you really think you can stop me? From getting to Hutan Temenggor?! Let her go! Let her go? Let her go?! Don't you know... in order to enter the Hutan a sacrifice must be made... This... smells just fine! My turn. Yekub!
