(mysterious music) (water rippling) (car approaching) (message chimes) (phone keys clicking) (♪♪) (clunking) - "step into the future" is good, But I wanna wrap up the presentation with An aspirational statement. Something like, "you can live in the future, In your exquisitely designed, Zero-carbon village green home, That is not only self-sustaining, But also helping to save the planet." - That's really great, helen. Oh, the messaging is so much clearer than it was a week ago. - Thank you. But I still feel Like it needs something about family. Or protecting your family. - Maybe drop in a couple touchstone words Like "secure" and "resilient." - Yeah, that's good. That covers everything. Thanks, judy. (phone chimes) (sighs) That is the third reminder about my meeting with Taylor's teachers next week. - I'm meeting with miles's teachers tomorrow. - Honestly, I am hoping they have some advice for me. This thing with taylor's not getting any better. - Hmm. - We used to share everything, And it's like, the past few weeks... (message chimes) ... He can barely even look at me. - I remember miles in middle school. He thought he was too cool for everyone, especially me. - Well, you may have noticed, Taylor's not exactly the "too cool" type. He's happiest in his room playing his video game. I don't know. Lately, it seems like he's escaping More and more into his games. Like, just wants to shut out The real world for some reason. - Any idea what's wrong? (sighs) - I'm worried he's being bullied. - Oh, gosh, I hope not. - Yeah. There was this kid A few years back, in his class, who would just Relentlessly harass him. Taylor wouldn't even go to school. - You think it's the same kid? - Uh-- (phone chimes) Hey, I would love for you to come by the village green site sometime. - I... I can't wait to see it. Uh, I will be back in a few with miles and dessert. - Thank you. Hey. Earth to taylor. - Mom, I'm texting with someone. - Well, could you text someone after you set out the plates? Thank you. Talk to me. - About what? (chuckles) - I can tell something's bothering you. - The only thing that's bothering me right now is all this. - All what? - This dinner, mom. - You used to love our family dinners. - You're making my science award a big deal And it really isn't. - Well, we all think it's amazing And we wanna celebrate you. (tender music) - Let's get this party started! - Thank you so much for coming. We're so glad you could both be here tonight. - Uh... Okay. - Good job. Hey, you are famous, my friend. Look at this. Look. Here. Hadley register did a huge article on you. - Wha... ? - Aw! Hey. - Ooh, thank you. - Mm-hmm. - So, how's it going with have a heart? - We've launched last week. - Wait, how did I miss that? - You didn't. We did a soft launch Just to get the app up. I'll send you a link. - Oh, and they also got four major updates, too. - Which is not unusual for a healthcare app. Or any other kind of app. - Well, you have been working at this for so long. Just please, let me know if I can help with anything. - I appreciate that. It's not at the level of village green yet, But uh, I'm getting there. - You're my best friend, judy. And you are doing a great job. I'm so proud of you. (chuckles) cheers. - Cheers. (gentle music playing in car) (music stops) (miles and taylor speaking indistinctly) - Make it 10, make it 10. - All right. - 10, 10. Ready? - Woo-hoo! - Sorry I'm late, everyone! Soccer practice went way, way over, and then, I promised I'd give olivia a ride home. And then, she asked if I'd give avery a ride home too, And I couldn't say no because we was, like, five feet away. - We'll discuss it later, gia. - Did I miss anything? - Mom and judy are just talking about work And miles is apparently the next golden boot winner. - Yeah, I heard you rocked oregon state playoffs. - Yeah, I did. (message chimes) - Go, you. - I can see you, gia. - Who are you texting? - None of your business. - What's going on? - I think taylor's texting a girl. - Oh, dude. (chuckling) (judy): Dinner's on! Oh, let's get a photo with The three of you together before we sit down at the table. - Mom, can you-- - there literally must be 1,000 photos of the three of us on your phone. - So? (scoffs) - This is an important night. Come on. Come on. (judy): Oh, look at you three! You're gorgeous! - How's this? (laughing) - perfect. Smile. (chuckling) (camera clicks) (gia): That's a classic! Mom, look at miles's selfies. - Those are funny, but why don't you show them The rock-climbing photos? - Ooh, ooh, here's one with taylor and me From a few months back. We need to go back out there again, yeah? It's been too long. - That'd be great. - Well, let's not forget why we gathered here tonight. Taylor, we are so proud of you. (exhales) - To taylor. - Taylor! - Taylor! - Taylor's excellence in science award is A great reminder to all of us. If we work hard, don't give up, And push our goals to the next level, good things can happen. Your father would be really proud of you. (soft piano music) - Hey, did you see the photo in The hadley register of miles Scoring the winning goal in last week's soccer game? (chuckles) - of course. It's on my wall. - He's a beast! - Hmm. - Whoa. (giggles) - a beast who'd better boost His scoring stats before the end of the season. Only 3 % of high school soccer players end up playing at Ncaa schools, and even fewer get scholarships. - And I'm working on it. - Well, we will all be cheering for you. - Thank you. (soft chuckles) (phone buzzes) (gia): Hey, you going to Sophia's surprise party on Saturday? - Yeah, I'm going. Did you hear about the dj that they hired? - Yeah! They're amazing. - Am I gonna see you there, taylor? (phone keys clicking) Taylor. - What? - Hello? Am I gonna see you at the party... ? - I wasn't invited. - Oh yeah, it's not a formal thing, it's just, you know, Anybody who knows sophia could just show up, right? It's... - Uh, I don't know. Avery is sophia's bestie and she invited me. (melancholic music) - Taylor? Are you okay? - I'm fine, mom. - Do you want me to ask avery if you're invited? - No, it's okay. Parties aren't really my thing. (miles): Taylor, buddy, I... (exhales) I'm... I'm sorry. I just... I honestly don't think He needs an invite, though, right? He just-- - It's okay. - Hey, best behaviour at sophia's party, right? - Yeah. Yeah, of course, yeah. (phone chimes) - Hmm. Good news. Avery says you are invited to sophia's party, t. - Did you beg her to invite me? - No. I just asked if there was a list, And she said there is and you are on it. - Okay, can we take a minute? I know that you both have super busy lives, But we made a pact a few years back to always be here, On time, for all family dinners. - Tonight wasn't my fault, mom. - And I understand, gia, But moving forward, can we please just make extra effort? - Yeah. - Yes. - Of course. - Good. Now, tell me about this sophia? - Sophia bliss? She's beyond, beyond the most popular human at hadley high. - She's also captain of the math team. And we're lab partners in chemistry class. What is it? - Well, who were you texting with earlier? (taylor sighs) pretty sure I saw the name emma on your phone. Do you have a girlfriend, t? - Uh, I guess emma's sort of a girlfriend. I met her playing force for good. - Your video game? - Yes. And she's incredibly smart. And nice. And she goes to winton high. - Why don't you take this emma to sophia's party? - We've only been texting each other for a couple weeks. - Oh, okay! So, you haven't met her? Like, in real life? - We text all the time. - What am I missing? - Emma could be a bot. Or someone could be pretending to be emma. - That's not funny. She's completely and totally real. - Come on. - Don't. (phone keys clacking) (message chimes) (soft music) - She'd love to go to the party with me. (squealing): Yes! - Yes! (laughing) (helen): This is a place where we can all live in the future, In our exquisite, zero-carbon homes. This is village green. Ever green. Forever home. (clapping) Thank you. - I know I'm new to the kpl team, but for me, That was... Wow! That was an amazing presentation. I would love to sign up for village green. - That's very kind of you to say. - Well, with any luck, barnes investments will be Equally impressed with village green's Very enthusiastic lead architect, too. - Thank you. - Jack. - Jack. - Yeah. - Uh, if you'll excuse me. - Yeah. (indistinct chatter) (taylor): When exposed to the light, Photosynthesis occurs and... - Is it... Is it supposed to be green? - Yeah, then we expose it to the light And then, what happens-- - is the assignment done? - Yeah, that's it. - I got a c on last week's chemistry test, So I need this to be perfect. - It's perfect, sophia. I promise. - Thank you. You're coming to my surprise party, aren't you? - Uh... Yeah. But isn't it supposed to be a surprise? - Weird how you're so smart yet so clueless. The surprise party was my idea. Do you think my parents could get dj rad? Never. - Ha! Taylor's never heard of dj rad. - Are you talking to me? - Hello, king of extra credit. Boom. No light, oxygen. - Boom? Really? Wow! Amazing that you didn't get the hadley science award This year instead of taylor. And heads up, you're not invited to my party, So don't show up because the doorman won't let you in. - Yeah, well, heads up to you too, princess. (camera clicks) No one ever tells me what I can and can't do. Ever. - You're so scary, lucas. (threatening music) Mrs. Rennie, taylor and princess are done. (chuckles) (soft tense music) (♪♪) - Can I help you? - Hi, again. - What are you doing in here? - Oh, I just uh... Back in chicago, at the firm I used to work at, I used to get my fellow architects A fun little gift to celebrate their big wins. Anyhow, I wanted to get you a special gift, But I realized I know nothing about you, Except le petit canard is your favourite restaurant. So, who is helen parker? - I'm kpl's top architect. - Yeah, yeah, but I mean, but beyond all that? Are you all just work and family, Or deep down, are you a... Wild one? - I am a mother of two amazing kids. They're my life. And my husband, daniel, Passed two years ago. Is that enough intel for you, jack? - I'm so sorry. I, I didn't mean-- - I think you should probably leave my office. (sighs) (message chimes) (lights buzzing) (ominous music) (giggling) - Oh, world's biggest nerd Probably got a b instead of his usual straight a's. (giggling) Bye. Hey! (taylor): That was not cool. - Come on, taylor. - I heard you, gia. You call me the world's biggest nerd and then you laugh? I'd never do that to you. - You're right. I'm sorry. It was a stupid joke. I think it's just... - What? - It's not always easy being the not genius sister To my genius brother, okay? - What are you talking about? You're super smart. - I don't have a 4.0 gpa And academic awards all over my wall. - Well, if it makes you feel any better, I hate the attention. Hate the awards. - Please just forgive me, okay? What's wrong? - Someone taped another note to my jacket. It's my photo from the hadley register with knives. "ready for the fun to begin, king of the losers? See you at sophia's party." (scoffs) - Look, I know you wanna let this all slide, But they're threatening you now. Those knives with the blood are next-level scary. You need to take this and the other notes To principal ramirez and you need to tell mom. - Maybe I just shouldn't go to sophia's party. - What? No! Come on, you can't cancel on your date with emma. I know how much this means to you. Don't let this creep ruin your life. (sighs) (house music) (door opening) (gia singing): Ooh, are you ready? (speaking): What? What's wrong? - She's not answering my texts. - Just call her, t. Her text-only rule is not cool. And very sketchy. (sighs) (dialling) (voicemail): Your call has been forwarded to An automatic voice message-- (beeps off) - It's fine. Come on, let's just go! - It's fine. You go. I'll stay here. (upbeat club music) (cheering) - Hi! - Hey! - Oh. - Come on! Dance with me! - Okay. (laughs) - okay. - Hi, I'm gia! - I know. I've seen you at school. I'm delaney. - Do you go to hadley high? - Yeah, I think I'm in A chemistry class with your brother, taylor. - Yeah, her and her dad moved here about a month ago. - No way! - Mm-hmm. - My dad works with your mom at kpl. - Such a small world! - Yeah, but wait, wait. Where's... Where's taylor at? - Oh! - He's supposed to be in here. - Long story. He's dealing with some stuff. He decided to stay home. - Oh. - Yeah. (laughs) - Hi! - Hi! Happy birthday! - Thank you! (cheering) (♪♪) - Is every guy at hadley high in love with sophia bliss? (chuckles) - they might be! - Great. Just another entitled rich girl who thinks We only exist for her own amusement. - What? - Nothing. (laughing and cheering) (knocking on door) (cheering over vr headset) (bell dings over vr headset) - Did gia tell you what happened? - She did. I'm sorry, sweetheart. - I went back and looked at my texts with emma. What if gia's right and emma's not real? - First of all, I can't believe anyone would be that cruel. - Or I'm the world's biggest loser. - You are not a loser. Do you remember that rafting trip We took to the grand canyon? - Of course. It was one of the best things I've ever done in my entire life. And it was our last vacation with dad. (sentimental music) - You know what I remember most about that trip? Your incredible bravery on the colorado river. (soft chuckle) You were 13 and these enormous waves were just Crashing down on us, all around us, in the boat, And you... You just kept on paddling. You stayed present And in the moment. And you kept us moving forward. That's who you are. I see it in everything you do. And it inspires me to do the same. You just keep on paddling. - I'll try, mom. (siren wailing) (suspenseful music) (knocking on door) (doorbell dings) - Can I help you with something? - Are you helen parker? - Yes, I'm helen. Is something wrong? - A young woman's dead body was found at city park About an hour ago. (gasps) Oh, my god, please. Not my daughter, gia. - It's not your daughter. Is your son taylor parker home? - Yes, of course, he's in his room. Why? - I have a warrant to arrest taylor parker For the murder of sophia bliss. - What are you talking about? There's gotta be some kind of mistake. (car approaching) (indistinct police radio chatter) Okay, where are you taking him? (gia): Mom! - You can't just take him, guys. - Mom, what is this?! - Honey, sophia bliss is dead And they think that taylor murdered her. - That's completely insane! (helen): He was with me All night. Tell them you were here with me, taylor. (officer): Okay, let's go. (gia): No, stop! Come on. (gia): You're making a huge mistake! My brother would never! He didn't kill anyone! (helen): Taylor! (gia): Are you listening to me?! (helen): Taylor, tell them you were here! (gia): Taylor! (indistinct police radio chatter) - You can't just take him. - Ladies, calm down. After he's been processed, he's gonna be transferred To the hadley juvenile detention centre. Somebody will contact you in the morning. (gia sobbing) (helen): No. - Mom! - Taylor. Taylor, no. Taylor! Taylor! (gia): Mom! (siren wails) - It's okay. It's okay. (journalist): Our victim, sophia bliss, Had just celebrated her sweet 16th birthday With friends and family. Hours later, she was found Dead in city park. This is breaking news And we expect a full update from hadley police At the top of the hour. - Thank you. - Did they call back? - Not yet. (doorbell dings) (door creaks opens) (sighs) - I know you're probably not hungry, But just in case. - Thank you, friend. - Do you want some coffee? I just made some for mom. - That would be nice. Thank you, sweetie. Any news? - Nothing yet. He's being transferred over To the detention centre and then, they're gonna call And let me know when I can go see him. (exhales) Can you imagine taylor in such a horrible place? - I hate to do this, but I have to tell you something. But I want you to know that it does not mean that I think that taylor did anything wrong. Okay, we both know he's a good kid and-- - Okay, just tell me what you're trying to tell me, judy. - Um, you know I'm a terrible sleeper, And uh, I was up late last night. And I saw taylor running down the street, our street, Just after 1 a.M. - He was in bed. - Well, he must have snuck out. - Taylor doesn't sneak out. You know him. - It was him. - You saw someone else. Or maybe somebody that looked like him. - Look I, I... Like I said, I don't think that taylor killed anyone. And I'm not gonna say anything to the police. But helen, just talk to him. Maybe he went for a walk or to meet a friend. But you should find out where he went. - No. This is... None of this is true! (sighs) (keyboard clacking) (ominous music) (beep) (crying softly) - Mom? - Gia. - Sorry, I... I was just coming to check on you. I didn't want to disturb you. - No, it's okay. Come in. (sniffling) - You know that this is just a huge mix-up, right? It was late and judy was half asleep. It's not like she saw sophia's murder. How can the police arrest him on such random evidence? - I don't know. But I need to show you something. (keys clacking) (beep) - There has to be a perfectly innocent explanation. I mean, it's taylor, mom. - As they were taking him away, he wouldn't even speak to me. And when he was in the back of the police car, He was just... Staring out at me with this... This look. I'd never seen it before. And it scared me. I know in my heart taylor's innocent, But where did he go last night? - I don't know, but he didn't do this. (birds chirping) They were out there all night. And all morning. It's plastered everywhere. All over the news And online that he's the murderer. Like, if you didn't know taylor, you'd think he did it, Just based on how they're presenting it. Yeah, whatever happened to innocent until proven guilty, right? (camera shutter snaps) Hang on, olivia. Hey! This is private property, you vulture! (teary sigh) (melancholic music) (door lock buzzes) (helen): Hi. - Hi. - Are you okay? Have you eaten anything? Taylor, I saw the home security video And I know that you left last night. - It's not what you think. - I don't think anything yet. But I need to know what happened. (♪♪) Where did you go? - Last night, after you left my room, I got a text from emma. She apologized for not showing up, And then asked me to meet her at city park, so I snuck out. And when I got to the park, sophia bliss was there. - Did sophia send you the texts? - No, she told me she'd received a text To meet up with someone, too. - We were both catfished. - Catfished? That's when someone's pretending to be someone else online? - Yeah, online and with texts, too. And loser me, I'm a perfect target. But I promise you, mom, Sophia and I laughed about how we fell for the fake texts, And then, we said goodnight. And she was in a hurry to get back to her party Before anyone noticed she'd snuck away And I even offered to walk her to her car, but... She insisted that she was fine 'cause she'd parked less than a block away. She was alive when I left that park. (dramatic boom) - I think whoever catfished me, Or both of us, murdered sophia. And mom, they're still out there. I mean, what if they come after you or gia next? - You listen to me. I can be a very fierce mama bear. So, you don't worry about us. I am gonna do everything in my power To clear you and get you home. (dog barking in distance) - Here. - How's he doing? - He's having a really hard time. I mean, can you imagine being locked up? He's never even been kept after school for detention. - Yeah, I know, it's just, you know, hopefully, They just, they figure out That he has got nothing to do with any of this and they just, They just let him come home 'cause it's just... - We gotta stay strong, right? - You're right. Yes, I... I know. It's just... I don't want anything bad to happen to him. And I can't believe sophia's... She's... She's dead. I... - Me either. None of this feels real. (phone rings) - Hey. Where are you? I thought you'd be home by now. - I need you to go through taylor's gaming laptop. - What, the police don't have it? - No. Apparently, they only grabbed His school laptop and his cell phone. Taylor said it was in his desk On the shelf when they dragged him out. I don't know, maybe they overlooked it, I don't know, But I need you to go through that. All of his texts Are backed up on that computer. I want you to go through them. See if there's anything in there That might help us figure out who was sending them. - Okay. I'll do it right now. - Okay, thanks, honey. I'll be home soon. Thank you for meeting with me on a Sunday. - It's part of my job, mrs. Parker. - Please, call me helen. - Okay, helen. Um, I spoke with a detective at the hadley police department Who claims the reason they were able to get That quickie arrest warrant last night is because They had a reliable witness Who saw taylor running from the scene. And they sent the police a timestamped photo of him. Also, taylor doesn't deny that He was at the park with sophia. - That doesn't prove anything. Have the police tracked the catfish texts That were sent to taylor? - The texts were sent From a burner phone. - Shouldn't that help him? He was lured to the park. - Unless we can prove to the police that The burner phone belongs to someone else, It won't help taylor. - So, what are you saying? - The police are convinced that the murder was well planned And that taylor created This elaborate catfish story as an alibi. - So, they're convinced that My son texted himself from a burner phone So that he could murder a girl he barely knew? - I'm in no way saying that taylor's guilty. This is just me letting you, The mother of my client, know all the facts, So that we can figure out the best way forward. (tense music) (gia): Ah, found it. - Hmm. - Thanks. (computer whirring) (gloomy music) - What... What is it? - Taylor likes to hide things. (chuckles) sneaky, t. - Oh, that was a good catch. - Well, I might not get all the awards like taylor does, But my dad always used to tell me I'm smart in my own special way. (ominous music) - It's a gift for emma. (rain pattering) - Hi! - Hi. I thought you could use a friend right now. And a coffee. - I do. - It's your usual skinny latte with an extra shot of espresso. - You're the best. Thank you. Hey, um, I hate to ask this, But did you tell the police that You saw taylor running down the street last night? - Well, I told you that I wasn't gonna say anything. Do you really think that I would lie to you? - No. No, no. It's just... Taylor's lawyers said that they have a reliable witness And I just can't seem to think who would've seen him And be able to identify him. - Oh, well, it wasn't me. Do you think this whole thing might be making you... A little paranoid? - Yeah, you're probably right. (camera clicks) Great. Welcome to my new life. If somebody's not glaring at me, they're taking a picture of me. I feel like I can't even go to the grocery store anymore. - Let's get you home. - Good idea. (mysterious music) (knocking) (jack): Hi. - Hi. - It's jack from your mom's office. - What are you doing here? - Hi. Don't worry. I heard about everything that's going on In the news, and I just wanted to come by and say I know taylor is completely innocent. And also, I thought you two might need a delicious dinner. - Okay. (dog barking in distance) (winds howling) - Sorry I'm so late. Jack. What are you doing? - I'm, uh, warming up your dinner. - So, you think you can just show up here And push your way into my house? - No, not at all. I... I'm just the delivery guy. - He's just heating it up for us, mom. Relax. - I'm a jerk. That was awful. Can you just pretend you didn't hear anything I just said? - Did you just say something? I'm sorry, I missed it. - Thank you. And thank you for this. It's my favourite food. I'm starving. - Well, I'm just happy to be here, Bringing your favourite food. (chuckles) - Jack, why don't you grab a plate and join us? - No, I... Really, I should get going. - Jack, I insist. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Well, all right, then. I'll grab a plate. - Most of the emma texts are sweet and funny. Some are kinda flirty. I get why taylor was so taken with her. - Don't you have to turn that computer over to the police? - Maybe. But I'm not helping them until they start Looking at an actual suspect Instead of building a case against my son. What's that? - Found it in taylor's locked drawer. It's a gift for emma. Should we give it to the police? - They'll just use it against taylor. - Mom, you look beat. Maybe you should go upstairs. Try and get some sleep. (sighs) - I'm still too wired to sleep. - How about a long walk? That always helps me. - That actually sounds really nice. - Great. Give me a minute and I'll check in with delaney And let her know what's up. - You know, I thought jack might be shady when you told me About him snooping around in your office, But I think he's crushing on you, mom. (jack): Hey, sweetie. What? - No, I don't... Well, maybe just a little. - Yeah. (jack): Look. Are you kidding me? Honey, you've gotta use your head. No. (water rushes) - How's delaney? - It's just a constant flow of rebellious teenage stuff with her. Her suv got stolen last night, So I asked her to report it. Except one of her friends finds it parked just outside The village green site an hour ago, So she thinks it's fine to just let it slide. (sighs) I try not to let this stuff get Under my skin, but I really should maybe start Meditating or something. I am so sorry. That is so ridiculous compared to what you're dealing with. - No, it's okay. I get it. - You know, a walk always does wonders for me. - Yeah, it's nice. You're right. This is a good idea. - Fresh air just does something to clear your mind. You know? - Yeah. Yeah, I agree. - I really appreciate you. (ominous music) (♪♪) (camera clicks) (door creaking) (tense orchestral music) (dialling) (phone buzzes) (beeps off) (door closes in distance) (footsteps approaching) (gia shrieks) - Gia?! - Mom! I'm here! (panicked breathing) Gia! Oh, my god. Are you okay?! (gia): There's someone in the house. - Stay here. I'll get the lights. (phone beeps) Go, be careful. (♪♪) (grunts) - Get back here! (grunts) You okay? - I'm okay. Are you good? - Yeah, I'm fine. - I'm gonna check on gia. - Got his phone! (quick knocks) - anybody home? Helen! I thought I heard a scream. Is everything okay? - It has been a crazy night. That reporter broke into our house And gia was home alone. - Is she okay? - Yeah, she's fine, but she is convinced that She saw somebody other than the reporter In the house at the same time. She says she saw somebody go into my office right before Seeing the reporter in my kitchen. - Well, maybe the reporter went Into your office to snoop around. - I don't know. - Did you call the police? - Yeah, I just got off the phone with them. They're gonna send somebody in the morning to get a description of the reporter, But honestly, I don't think they care about us. We're just the murderer's family. - Oh... Well, what happened to him? - Well, my friend jack was here. He chased him outta the house. - Who's jack? - He works with me at kpl. He was here. He brought dinner. - Oh. - Someone disconnected and removed All your security cameras, helen. It couldn't have been that reporter. - God, gia was right. There was somebody else in the house. - Mom, they took taylor's gaming laptop. And emma's present, too. (sighs) come on. (somber music) (phone buzzes) (dramatic boom) (birds chirping) Mom. (exhales) - I wish dad was here. I need him. And I miss him. - Me too. - It's funny, just when I think I'm doing really great At this whole "adjusting to life without him" thing, I just can't stop missing him. I don't think it's ever gonna change. - It would be sad to me if you did stop missing him. - He would be disappointed in all this. It's a fail. - Mom. Stop it. That's not true. - I failed to protect our family. - No way have you failed. That's nuts. Mom, none of this has anything to do with you. You're like the most amazing mother and mentor and friend. And dad would be really proud of your kickass parenting style. And all your success at kpl to keep us going. (sighs) - don't ever forget that. You constantly blow me away. - I love you for saying that, but... We are basically prisoners in our own home And taylor is in jail for murder. - He didn't do it. - I know that. - But... Like, you can't be Thinking this because... It's taylor. Gamer geek. Science nerd. He's not a killer. - I need to show you something. Look at the expression on your brother's face. That is the exact same look he had on it when The police were taking him out, and I just... I can't get it out of my mind. It's, it's like, I see that it's taylor, but I feel like I'm looking at A complete stranger. - Taylor's been dealing with a bully at school. (somber music) For the last few weeks. They were leaving these, like, really creepy notes With these collages that were taped to his coat inside his locker. - No, wait, how did they get into his locker? - No idea. But mom, in every one, They used all caps and they called taylor a loser. - Why didn't he tell me? - I told him to tell you a million times, But he didn't want you to be worried about him In the middle of your village green project. - Where are those notes? - I looked for them all day in his desk. I couldn't find anything. Maybe he threw them away. - I hope not. This... This bully could be the murderer. - Yeah. Maybe. And maybe it's a student in taylor's chemistry class. That photo was taken in mrs. Rennie's chemistry lab. - I really... I feel horrible Doubting your brother, but there's just so much Pointing towards him. We really need to find something That points towards someone else. - I agree. - I know that you said you were gonna stay home today, But um, maybe you could just go down to his chemistry class And talk to some of the other students? - Yeah. I'm on it, mom. - Okay, wait, wait. Just um... Just promise me that You are gonna be extra, extra careful. - I promise. (door rattling) (delaney): No school today. The candlelight vigil for sophia bliss will be held At city park tonight at 7:00. I just found out myself. - Yeah. I don't know what I was thinking. - Dad told me what happened last night And I'm so sorry you and your family are going through this terrible nightmare. - You know, as hard as this is for us, I can't even imagine what sophia's family Is going through right now. Oh, it's just so sad. - The nonstop news is making it seem like the police aren't Looking for any other suspects. Is that true? - It's true for the police. But there is someone else. - Really? Who? - You're in taylor's chemistry class, right? - I am. - Do you have any idea who might've taken this photo? (chilling music) - No idea. Um, but I think There's a similar photo on hadley high's swiftygram. Here. - Who is he? - Lucas peters. He's a colossal jerk. - Come with me. I think I have a plan. (birds chirping) - Helen. - Good morning. - Oh... Did you get any sleep? - To be honest, I was still a little rattled. - Oh. If you're ever nervous, you can call me. I can always camp out on your couch and I'll bring miles. - Thank you. - Uh, this is a, uh... A gift from miles to taylor. - That's really kind. - It's got some puzzle books And a couple of taylor's favourite candy bars. Will they allow it? - Unfortunately not, but I'll keep it at home for him. Yes. He'll really appreciate this. You know how much he looks up to miles. Is everything okay? - Oh, no big deal, Just my whole life is falling apart. I'm sorry, I... I shouldn't have said that. I know that it's nothing Compared to what you're going through. - What's going on? - It's um... Miles continues to struggle in school. His physics teacher e-mailed me this morning to say that He failed his midterm yesterday. (sighs) I'm worried about his scholarship. And on top of that, my app, it's, it's just not getting the downloads that it needs. Honestly, I don't know what I'm gonna do if it fails. - Hey, just keep the faith. I'm sure everything will, you know, Turn around with work and with miles. - I don't really think that I can smile My way through this one. - I didn't say that. - I know, I'm sorry. I... I'm uh, in a terrible, horrible mood And the last person I wanna hurt is you. (suspenseful music) - We're good. - Which one is it? - Um, I think it's just the one over there. It's that one. (lock rattles) (scoffs) Think this is lucas's locker? - That collage looks a lot like the notes taylor got. - What are you looking for? - Not really sure. It's him. - My god. (camera clicks) - Why would he leave his phone in here? - Because that's a burner phone. (clunking in distance) (whispers): Someone's coming. Put it back! - Maybe part of it is the pressure of being a single parent, you know? I know all parents struggle to keep their kids on the rails Until they're out on their own, but... Some of us struggle a lot more than others. Right? And I just worry that... (sighs) what if miles never achieves Anything beyond his high school sports trophies? I really thought that this app Would be successful and inspire him, and... You know, it would be something that I could leave him. - You do not have to worry about that right now. Miles is an amazing person. He has so many great qualities. I'm sure he'll figure it out. - I hope you're right. - Hey, it'll be okay. - Thank you. - Yeah. I gotta run. (alarm buzzes) Taylor. - How'd you find them? - You've been leaving things in your father's fishing box Since you were five years old. A mom knows these things. Whoever left these notes for taylor and sent me the text messages Could be the same person who broke into your house, Destroyed our security cameras, stole his laptop. Why would they do any of it Unless they were the real killer? - This is from the city park webcam. (beeps) (tense music) (dramatic boom) You had told me and you had told the hadley police department That on the night of the murder, You and sophia went your separate ways, But this contradicts your sworn statement, taylor. And sophia's body was found 10 feet away from Where you two were last seen together. (shouting): We split up right after that! - This doesn't prove anything. - Taylor's very angry in this video. - I didn't do it! - Taylor. (shouting): It wasn't me! I didn't do it! I would never hurt sophia! I didn't do it! - Taylor. - Mom! - Don't hurt him, please. - I didn't do it, mom! This wasn't me! (helen): Please don't hurt him! - It wasn't me! - Bully is lucas peters. And he had a huge crush on sophia bliss. - How do you know his name? - Long story. Jack's daughter, delaney, helped me break into lucas's locker. We found a burner phone. - You broke into his locker? Are you crazy? - Nobody knew it was us. - Did anybody see you? - No, no. We got away and delaney left an anonymous tip For the police to search lucas's locker. (sighs) - can you send me a text of that and a photo? - Sure. You okay, mom? - The police have webcam footage of taylor at the park With sophia and he looks really angry. - I don't care. I know he didn't kill her. (phone rings) - Hello, this is helen. Of course. I'm coming right now. I have to go to the office. - What? - Lock the doors. I should be about an hour. (indistinct chatter) (office phone ringing) (elevator dings) What's going on? - I'm uh, leaving kpl. Hanging my own shingle. Yeah, I've always wanted my own business, But I never had a project big enough to carry it. - Ah. Barnes investments decides they can't work With kpl anymore because of all the bad press About me and taylor, and you use it As your golden opportunity to take the village green project. - Kpl gave me their blessing, And I told kpl I'd bring them back in After all this craziness blew over. It's win-win. Hey, I'm not the bad guy here. - I never said that you were. This is one of the worst days of my entire life. Losing the village green project and my job. Best of luck. (crying) (sniffling) I can't talk right now. - I'm really sorry About everything. And I just... I hope this doesn't impact Our new friendship. - Look, I don't know what you've made up In your head about us, but we barely know each other. (phone rings) I have to take this. Susan. I know the identity of the bully. His name is lucas peters. And he had a crush on sophia bliss. - I'll pass his name along to the hadley police. We need to meet to put together our plan for taylor's defence. (sinister music) - Can you send me the city park webcam video? - Okay, helen. - Thanks. I need to show you something. - That's delaney's suv. (phone buzzes) (dramatic boom) (chilling music) (phone buzzes) - I need a minute. - Mom. (indistinct chatter) (crying) - Miles! (suspenseful music) No, just get in. (helen): Someone thinks we know something. (camera shutter snaps) - Lucas peters? - Maybe. - We don't have our security cameras to prove it's him. - Who would do such a horrible thing? - We don't know. At least a couple of coats of paint should cover that up. - Well, sign me up for the paint crew. - I will. - Now, why don't you grab an overnight bag And come stay with us? You two, me and miles, pat's pizza. - That'd be great. Gia, you go ahead with judy. (camera shutter snaps) I'll pack the bag. - You sure? - Yeah. I have to call taylor's lawyer and update her. - Come. (bird cawing in distance) - I don't understand. You said that you weren't in love with her! - Listen, look, you don't understand. This has nothing to do with you or with us. I just need you to trust me on this. - I-- okay? Please, we had something in the past. And it means nothing anymore! It doesn't, delaney! It does not mean anything anymore! - It means everything! You told me that you weren't in love with her! - It has nothing to do with you Or with us, okay?! You just don't understand! - Where are you going?! - I just... - So, miles, how well do you know delaney? I mean, you two are friends, right? - Um... We're like, we're like new friends. Like, we haven't really hung out a lot, so... Don't really know her too well. - Who is delaney? - She's just a friend from school. - Hmm. - Did delaney know sophia bliss? - I, I... She went to her birthday party, But I don't think she, like, you know, really knew her. - And they have chemistry class together. - Yeah, but that, that doesn't really make them friends, though. - No. I don't think delaney knows anyone that well yet. - Yeah, yeah. She was um... Telling me, you know, that it's hard for her To make friends 'cause um, You know, her and her dad move around a lot. So, it's... It's tough on her. - Wonder why they move around so much? - I don't know. - Do you know this girl? - Jack is delaney's dad. You met him at our house? - Oh yeah. - But uh... Why all the questions about delaney? I mean, she's not... She's not in trouble, right? - Her suv was parked across-- - oh. We can't talk about that. - Oh, sorry. - Sorry, you guys, it's just some stuff from taylor's lawyer. We're not allowed to share, So let's just forget it. - Well, it's all just so tragic. I still can't believe sophia's gone. She was such a lovely, young woman. - They're having a candlelight vigil for her tonight. - Are you two going? - I'd like to go, but I don't... I don't think it's a good idea for me to show up. (judy): Oh. Of course. Are you going? - Um... I have some ap french homework That I gotta finish, so um... Goodnight, you guys. - Mm. (scoffs) - Didn't miles go on a couple dates With sophia last summer? - Mmm, he did, but he had his eye on someone else And moved on pretty quickly. - Why would judy pretend not to know delaney? - Maybe she really doesn't know her. Did she say her name? - No. - She probably just thinks it was some random Giving miles a ride. - Maybe. - I don't think miles got over sophia As fast as his mom said he did. What if he was still in love with her, And delaney knew and was insanely jealous? Or what if jack's in on it too, And the two of them, they set up taylor so that He could take over your village green project? - Miles said they were just friends. - No. They were together-together at sophia's party. (sighs) - It's a bit of a reach, don't you think? Gia, what is it? - I asked delaney who took this photo. And she said she didn't know, but mom, she took it. Why would she lie to me? - That is so strange. - Do you think we should at least call the police? - And tell them what? This is all just a crazy speculation. - She lied about the photo! - We need real evidence. - You don't think delaney did it, do you? - I just... I have such a hard time thinking such a bright, Young woman could do something so awful. - Do you think it was lucas peters? - Oh... I don't know who to trust at this point. Look, I want you to take this, put it in your bag. Take it everywhere with you and do not hesitate to use it. - Okay. - I just want you to be safe. (mournful music) (blows) (distant crack) (tense music) - Helen? Helen, wake up. - Judy? Judy, what's wrong? Is it taylor? - No, taylor's fine. Helen, lucas peters is missing. It's all over the news. They say that he left a note Confessing to sophia's murder And then jumped off the hadley bridge. The police are searching the river now. (sighs) - oh, my god. Okay. - Any comment on lucas peters, mrs. Parker? No comment? Will your son be released today? - No comment. - This is beyond sad. I feel sick. (phone buzzes) (doorbell dings) - Taylor's lawyer wants me to call her. - It's probably about getting him out. - I don't think so. (outgoing ringtone) (susan): We don't know yet if lucas killed sophia bliss. (doorbell dings) (pounding on door) - what? - Lucas's family claimed that He was away with his family last weekend. Also, the police believes that someone killed lucas. Made it look like a suicide, Created that concussion to blame sophia's death on him, So they're looking into multiple suspects. - Do they think it was me? - No, but your daughter, gia, is one of the suspects. (loud knocking on door) - Mrs. Parker. (dramatic boom) (judy): We ate pizza and went to bed. Nobody left the house. - How can you be so sure? - I'm a very light sleeper. If anyone had left the house, I would've heard them. (pensive music) - Okay, thank you. This has been very helpful. Sorry for all the questions. But only a handful of people knew about the collage messages, And we had an anonymous tip that Gia had broken into lucas peters's locker yesterday. - Does this mean taylor won't be released today? - Unless we have another suspect in custody Or you find evidence to clear him, Your son will remain at the detention centre. (school bell rings) - Delaney! (delaney): Hey! (tense music) - I know what you did. I know what you and your dad did to sophia and to lucas And you're not gonna get away with it. - What, you're not even gonna defend yourself?! You two are a bunch of killers! - We didn't do anything. My dad isn't involved-- - You're lying! I know you did this! My brother is in jail! How could you do this to him?! Stop lying! Get off me! Get off! (whirring) - His truck. (pivotal music) (dialling) (jack): I am so sorry. I... I didn't handle Any of the kpl transition well. - Jack, can you come over right now? I need your help. - I'm on my way. - This is miles's burner phone. - Delaney... - He used it to send taylor the emma texts. - You're lying! - Gia, stop. (tense music) - Tell her, miles. - It's not what you think. I made up emma because I wanted taylor To feel better about himself. I... Look, I know how wrong that is now. It's just... Look, I was worried about him. 'cause he's always getting bullied and I thought This was gonna help him somehow. I thought... I thought this would help! - And... I saw how awkward Taylor was at school. And I felt bad for him. So, I kept the burner phone and I wrote some of the texts So that emma would sound more authentic. And... Honestly, I just did it 'cause I really wanted miles to like me. - You're both disgusting. (♪♪) Did you kill sophia? - No! I was at the party with you. - Miles? (thud) (threatening music) (helen): First of all, I apologize for everything That I said yesterday. - Really? I-- - Can I just finish? I completely understand what you did. If you hadn't jumped in, the entire village green site Could've been shut down. I would've done the exact same thing for my family. - Wow, um... Thank you. (soft chuckle) - Does that mean you accept my apology? - Yes, of course, I do. Apology accepted. - Great. So, after a couple nights of no sleep, I finally slept last night and when I woke up and heard The sad news about lucas, something hit me. I think I can clear taylor, but I need some help. - Okay. I have no idea what you're talking about. Just let me know what I can do. - But I remember you saying that Delaney's suv was stolen the night of sophia's murder, And it was left by the village green site? - Yeah, we picked it up there. - Okay. Could you go down to the site And check the security footage for me? - Yeah, of course. - Okay. Do you have the key card, uh, passcode? - Kpl sent me everything last night. - Okay. (deep exhale) (door closes) Hey! - Hi. How are you holding up? - I'm a little jumpy. (chuckles) - Any more news from the police? - No, but I... I think I might be able to clear taylor. - Uh, what do you mean? - Well, it's a long story, But I think that sophia's killer was driving delaney's suv, Which was stolen the night of her murder. And they left it by the village green site. - How would that clear taylor? - Because there are several security cameras In the site's trailer. I just sent my friend jack down to check the video footage. If I can tell the police who was driving that suv, They might have the real killer. - I need you to understand, I never meant to get taylor into trouble. - What are you talking about? - I need you to understand-- - You didn't kill sophia! You didn't! I know you didn't! - Look, gia, it was my fault. It... No, gia! I'm not a murderer. I swear to you. I... No, I didn't, I didn't murder anybody, okay?! I-- (party music) (cheering) I loved her. I still do. It's just... Look, I just wanted to talk to her! Alone! That's all I wanted! And I wanted to see if maybe we could Get back together again, but I... I was afraid she would say no. And I knew she wouldn't wanna talk to me! So, I sent her this message as this guy That I knew she liked and I just thought to ask her To come to the park to meet me and... She said yes. So, that's why I took delaney's car, And I was gonna go... Then I remembered, what if she doesn't... What if she just leaves when she sees me? So, that's why I... I messaged taylor, 'cause I know that she trusts him, And I thought, "I'll just send him one more message as emma." (message chimes) just one last time So I could get him there. So he could help me. And I made my way there. And it worked. And it worked until it didn't. (suspenseful music) (sophia): Yeah, it's kind of a weird situation. (indistinct chatter) - That's okay. Wasn't my thing. - See you later. (dramatic boom) - Hey. - What's going on? - I... I just wanted to talk. - Oh. You catfished me. Wait, did you catfish taylor, too? - Yeah, I did, but-- - Ew! Could you be a bigger creep?! - Listen, no, sophia, no. I'm not a creep. - Stay away from me. - I'm not a creep, okay? I'm not! Sophia, sophia! I'm not a... Listen. You're making this something that's not Because I can't stop loving you and you mean the-- - Help! - Sophia! Sophia, just... Please hear me out! (thud) - Ah! (crack) (sinister music) - Sophia? Sophia! (sobbing) (panting) (dialling) (judy): Honey? - Mom? - Is something wrong? - Can you... Can you please come to city park? (crying): I just... I think sophia's dead. - What?! - Look, she's not moving And I... I don't know what to do! I, um-- - What happened? What did you do? - No! I literally didn't do anything, mom! I promise you! She just... She fell! It was an accident! I didn't... - Do not touch anything or anyone. Do not call or text anyone. I'm on my way. (tense music) (camera clicks) (sobbing) (exhales) (trembling breaths) (gasps) - Mom, did you... Did you call the police? - Shhh! Don't say anything! I'm thinking! - Mom, we need to tell them. - And then what? They arrest you and charge you for murder And your life is over? - But mom, it was... It was an accident. I'll tell them. They'll believe me. - No, no, no! What if they don't believe you? What if they don't believe you?! Okay?! Look, look, look. I think I have a plan That will save you, okay? But you have to trust me, And you can never, ever, ever tell anyone about tonight. Do you understand me, miles? (sobbing) - mm-hmm. (suspenseful music) - Get in that suv and follow me! Go! Go! (miles): I didn't tell anybody and I didn't tell you because My mom said no one will believe it's an accident. And that if I told anybody, I'd be... I'd ruin her life. All right? And I'd end mine, too. - But it was fine to ruin taylor's life? (shouting): Huh?! You should've called the police! (shouting): I wanted to! I wanted to! I'm sorry I didn't! I was scared! I didn't know what to do! And I did not know that my mom Was gonna do the things that she did! I had no idea! I didn't know! - Did judy kill lucas? - I don't know for sure, But she did leave as soon As you and your mom went to bed and then... She... She was gone for a few hours. - Where's your mom now? - I don't know. She's not answering my texts. But gia, can you just listen to me? Gia? (dialling) - Come on, mom! (whirring) - Gia, I didn't... - Don't... Don't move! - Delaney, I'm not gonna-- - no! (soft music) (dramatic boom) (threatening music) - Is this your recipe for a perfect life? - You're joking, right? - Not really. (phone rings) - I have to get this. Hey! Did you get in? (jack): I did. - And did you see who was driving the suv? - There were two people: A young man in a baseball cap I couldn't see very well, But the other person... It's your neighbour, judy. - Judy? - Helen? - Hang up so we can talk. - Talk? Are you insane?! - Please, let's just... Just take a moment so I can explain. I want you to know how sorry I am That things turned out the way that they did. - You're a murderer. - No, no, no, no, no! Nobody murdered sophia! It was an accident! - An accident? You killed lucas! You murdered him! - But I did that for taylor! You know how much I love him! Please, please don't ruin everything. Okay? Taylor will be out soon. Please, helen, we're like family. - Like family?! - Yes! Please, don't call the police! I... I had to protect miles! You would've done the same for gia or for taylor! Please think of miles! He has no one! Please! Please don't! - No! - Please! (shouting) (phone clatters to floor) No! No!
