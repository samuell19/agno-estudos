Can't see your mark. Go, girls. Let's go! Come on. Let's go. Come on. Hey, Karen, your pigtails suck! Karen sucks. You should just bring the bitch. Next time, seriously, she hurts you, I hurt her. No doubt. Dude, I could not give a shit about her. Okay. So, he picked Stanford? - Mm-hmm. - Dick. Why... Why... Why not Brown? It's like an hour away, right? His dad went to Stanford. We got in a huge, - huge fight. - Oh, I heard. - Are you serious? - Yeah. I mean, everyone on the third floor heard. - Fuck. - Yeah. - Shit. - You two never fight. Yeah, I know. He's coming over tonight, later. Well, you look like shit. Oh, you do. Sorry. Go to sleep. Bye, honey. Wait, text me if he calls. Aw. Thank you. Tara! I'm home. Oh, you got him. Great. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Tara, check the baby. Can you get him for me this time? - No. - Why not? 'Cause it's your turn. Please. I'll give you five bucks. - I don't care. - I'll give you ten bucks. I don't care. Hi, Jack. I'm here. You're good. Yeah. You're good. It's okay. Never gonna hurt you. Promise I'll never hurt you. Tara! Are you okay? - Hurt who? - Nothing. No... Nothing, Mom. Well, if he's hungry, you can just bring him down. Okay? He's not hungry. He just needs a change. - And you're gonna change him? - Yeah. Stop yelling. What if Gina isn't coming back? What do you mean? Let's say there was a big fight. Something not even a dozen roses could fix. Where did you get that? The more we know, the more we can help. The babysitter. I sent texts. I'm no molester. What's the babysitter's name? Tara Haldon. Thanks for your time. Mm. Go on. I need the car this weekend. Me and Suzy are gonna be babysitting again. Not for that Gina Loeb. You know I don't want you going over there anymore. Mom, I told you I'm not. I'm not babysitting for them anymore. What happens when I'm driving, and we have one car? I don't know what went on with you and Gina, but, um, what's her husband's name again? Mikhail. Yeah. He's got a tree he needs cut down. Now can I take the job, or, uh, I'll be violating some family feud? That car will be a total P-O-S when I get to it. Listen. You start saving now, you can buy a car. When I was 16, I bought my own car. And no P-O-S. I said P-O-S, that's not a curse. Actually, you know what, Ben? You should charge the Loebs double. They're a bunch of rich stuck-ups. I heard that Gina Loeb... ...spent a thousand dollars on a baby stroller made of some sort of, I don't know, special steel. It's a step up from the wheelbarrow you guys used for us. Nah. No need for a wheelbarrow. We locked you in your closet till you were six. Like Aunt Diane. You had to go there? Listen, that's my sister... and I've been thinking, you know, it's been, um, six months, and I think we should all... maybe take a trip up there - on Saturday. - Sorry, Mom. Remember Boy Scout project? I got a job in Worcester. Really, it won't take that long. I know you hate going, but... I mean, she's family. It's... It's the right thing to do. You can say "piece of shit." I think you're old enough now. So, you have to go to the prison? No, we're going to the psych ward. Mom's gonna be hysterical the whole time. It's fucking annoying. Okay. Well, do you want company? You'd do that for me? Yeah. Sure, sure. Besides... ...obviously, it kind of sounds like a Lifetime Movie. Like My Killer Aunt starring Jennifer Love Hewitt. Fuck you. Yeah? Carl is downstairs. Yes? No? Well, take me with you. I'll be your voice of reason. Your Wi-Fi Jiminy Cricket. Let me think about that for a second. No. My... My advice is just ditch him. - No. - No. He's... He's a lost cause - 'cause he doesn't... - Bye. Love you. - Oh, hey. - Hey. Um. Hang on. Um. Carl going away to Stanford. He hasn't done this to hurt you, you know. Yeah, well. And... And... And I don't wanna give you a bunch of bullshit about absence making the heart grow fonder because it doesn't. It sucks and it hurts like hell, but, uh... Oh, great. Do you also go to the orphanages on Father's Day - and laugh at kids? - But absence also clarifies, it validates, it tells you whether it's love or not. And then if it is... Stanford, Japan, the Moon, none of that matters. - Yeah. - Yeah. Your mom told me about... uh, Pigtails. - I don't wanna talk about that. - You just let me know if I should talk to her parents. No. I don't want you to talk to them. I'm not gonna let anyone hurt you... ever. Okay. I can take care of myself. You all right? Hey, what are you doing this weekend? Oh, my God. Monday's Columbus Day. Yeah, yeah. No, I was thinking maybe if Suzy could cover for us... we can get away like we did last... What? You don't like that idea? - No. I love that idea. - Yeah? - I'd love to do that. - Mm. What? Why are you looking like that? You sure you wanna go to Stanford? Oh, my God. No. - Why? What are you about to do? - How about now? Mm. - I said... - Mm. Yeah. How 'bout now? - Why did you stop? - What the fuck? - What? - Wait. - Someone's in my room. - What you mean? Someone's in my room. - Hey, Tara, wait. - What? - Aren't we celebrating? - Yes. Wait. Come here. Oh, my God. You don't get it. You'll never be... Fucking hell. What are you doing? Can you stay out of my room? I don't ask for much. That's all that I ask. In return, I'll get straight A's, I won't get high, and I'll never have to Google the word chlamydia. Okay? Stop going in my room. I don't know. You deal with it. We are at Defcon Four. I repeat, we are at Defcon Four. Not good with Carl? No, Mom. Actually, things were really great with Carl. Why do you just assume things are bad? I'm just really annoyed... because someone keeps on coming in my room and touching my stuff. Every single day, something of mine is either moved or missing. No one's... I mean, no one's coming in your room. Yeah, I know. No one's coming in my room and I'm just going fucking crazy, right? If so, then... why? I'm the happiest that I've ever been. I have my coach, my teammates, Carl, they all like me. I'm doing a great job. How about your dreams? - What? - It's just that's how it... it... it started with... Diane, nightmares. And, you know, the whole time she was happy. - She was so happy. - I'm... not her. And I'm not saying you are. It's just... it's just that... It was just that she was 16 when it started, and you're a year older, and... it's just a family history. You mean the Borden family curse? The nursery rhyme... is part of our family history. You know, mental illness, it's... it's... - it's not a curse. - No, it's not a curse. - It's... It's a blessing. - I'm just saying that there... there are things that you can do. There's medication. I'm not gonna do medication. Why would you say that? I'm not crazy. Honey, I'm on your team. So, here's what we're gonna do. Let's just start with seeing Dr. Sanchez tomorrow at 3:30 after practice. I'm fine. I'm honestly fine. I'm just tired because I just... ...I haven't been sleeping that much because, you know, I've been sewing all night since Grandma sent the trunk of clothes. That's it. Let's just see what the therapist has to say. Okay? What do you think? Will you please get out of my room now? Yeah. Yeah. Will you please get out of my room? I'm just gonna say I think you... Please just leave me alone right now? Please. Just give me a second. I just think you're very talented. Please get out of my room. Tara... Tara... - You're not real. - Sure I am. You're not real. No. You're not real. You're not real. You're not real. If it isn't real... bring it down on your brother's head. Your aunt wasn't afraid. Therapy isn't enough, you know that. Didn't work with Diane, why would it work... Do not bring up my sister. How dare you bring up my sister like that? I'm trying to save her, too. I will just go ahead and have a drink. Honey, is that you? Tara. Tara... Tara? Yeah? You're late. - Gotta go. Come on. - Okay. Just a minute. Tara, I am not driving you again. Okay. You don't have to. Just one second. I'm not crazy. Tara... you having a good day? No diploma. Where'd you go? Online? - Harvard. - Hmm. And you? Have you thought about college? Maybe fashion. I actually bought one of your dresses from your mom. My dress pimp. She told me about your aunt and family history. She's concerned. What? That I'm one step closer on my way to crazy town? My family's curse? And school? How are things going? What are you typing? Notes... so I can review them later. Just keep it off the cloud. I don't want someone hacking you. Your computer, I mean. Not with an axe. That was a joke. I understand that you're going to see your aunt. Mm-hmm. Tell me about her. Well... ...she suffocated her child when she was 16 years old. And she's been locked up ever since. She's the, uh, winner of our family's "Black Sheep of the Year" award. Twenty years running, actually. You think it's humorous? No, I don't. I'm... not laughing. There is an infant in your home. I'm not saying you're schizophrenic. You're just a stressed-out high schooler... ...but, mid-teens is when this disease first manifests. - And its prodromal stage... - Prodromal stage? Are you serious? Beginning stage. You may feel a certain euphoria, a sense of empowerment. Things seem clear to you. You feel amazing... and you can be prone to fits of anger and violence, experience multiple personalities... use different voices, hear voices. But it can be held in check with drugs and therapy. Mm-hmm. I would never hurt my family. Type that in your fucking keyboard. Tara... Tara... You're fine. Your aunt wasn't afraid. Everything's fine. Tara Haldon? He sent me some texts and... and a photo. Mikhail? I make clothes. I sell my stuff on Etsy, and he bought one of my pieces. And he told me he wanted me to model it for him. And then came the dick pic. You do know what he did was illegal. Yeah, you would have to arrest half this town. - She knew. - Gina? Mm-hmm. Anyone else? My mother. She knows about the text, not the photo, though. And, uh, just your mom? Yeah. My dad's... a little more protective, so I'd rather him not know at all. Let's just stick with the babysitting. I mean, you... you kept doing it. Why? What? Are you saying I've something to do with this? We're just doing our due diligence. Hmm. Okay, are we done? You're going to Laurie's? Laurie kinda sucks. I don't know. But I mean, maybe. You cutting through? Yeah. Text me if you go. - Bye. - Bye. Hello? Is anyone there? Help! Help me! Help! Help me! Can you pass me the lace? I wish I sewed. Or anything. I mean, I don't do the sports thing, or... the glee thing. Hmm. I know you would think you're... sewing stuff and... selling them. I don't know. You just have like this, this real talent. You okay? I think I'm gonna kill my family. You and every other teenager. No, I'm for real. Don't say a word to anyone. Okay. What's going on? I've dreamt about it. I thought things were going good, great even, but... the nightmares I've been having... I'm scared. This nightmare, I don't know. I just... I think you should just stop worrying about your fucked-up family and dreams. I know. You know what? Besides, I think... every daughter wants to kill their mother at some point. Fucking tell me about it. Come here. Come here, my love. Hey, why are you up? My service project for becoming a First Class Scout. Oh, yeah. You're building something. What do you... What are you building? Park benches. Okay. Jesus. What is it this time? God damn it. Please! "You're never home." "You don't help with the Jack." He's mad she's not going to take them. Them? Is that us? Sounds like we're with Dad in the divorce. Caleb, come on. Come on. Oh, yeah. Right... - today. - Yeah. You better check with your mother, I don't know what the hell's going on. - Caleb, come on. Let's go. - Wash it. He's running hot. Do you want me to call a doctor? No, no, no. It's only 101. You're gonna be okay, right? My tough little monkey... - right, Jack? - I like your hair. - What? - I like your hair. Do you? It's very vintage. Well, that sounds old. Um, listen, I want you to go ahead and go up and see Aunt Diane today. What? Without you? I... I don't wanna go alone. I don't even know her, Mom. You won't be alone. You said that Suzy wanted to go. Yeah, she offered. I'm not gonna actually - make her come with me... - Jack has a fever. She already knows that we're coming. I'm not gonna disappoint that poor woman. Ma, she killed her kid. You don't know what you're talking about. Yeah, I do. She's a murderer. You don't know anything about that. Ma, I really don't wanna go. Oh, my God. Will you please just do this for me? - Please? - Okay, okay. - Why do I have to beg you? - You're not. I'm going. And don't call her a murderer. She is a murderer. Just saying it like it is. Nice try. We saw you. How can I help you? As I understand it, this was your... - Third. - ...third... altercation with Karen. It happens in field hockey all the time. And she's a bully. Hmm. I do think it's interesting that you knew Gina Loeb and Karen, and both women are missing. Are you implying that my daughter might have... something to... Because you know who else knew both of those women? Gina's husband. Karen would babysit for them. - Thank you both. - You're welcome. We will be in touch. - Thanks for the coffee. - Mm-hmm. I didn't do anything. I didn't say you did. I hope she's okay. Yeah, me too. Well, to be honest, like... I'm really not upset that Karen is missing. She's probably on a fuck and coke bender with Nick the Dick. What's going on? - What is wrong with you? - Nothing's wrong with me. I just... I mean, what's the big deal? It's Karen. - I mean, we hate that bitch. - I just don't know. Sorry, I just really don't wanna talk about this right now. All right. Love you. Be good. I'll be here... just chill in.' Like a villain. Um. Sorry, um, your sister couldn't... make it. Jack's sick. Sick? It's just a fever. It's nothing serious. And you? How are you? Good. Something's different about you. I didn't see it before. - I'm older now, so... - No, no, no. That ain't it. Yeah. That look, I know what that is. I've seen it before in myself. It's happened. Seen... Seen what? It's like getting your period. The women in our family always seem to meet her at a certain age. Your mom, too. Oh, she's met her. They told me she was a coping mechanism. Someone for me to place the blame on. You must have some dark, dark thoughts. I'm not... like you. I would never hurt a child. I would never... smother and bury a child. You wanna know a secret? He wasn't smothered. Tradition demanded a bit... more... harshness. Tradition? So naive. It was an axe. Funny thing is, I don't even remember doing it. I blacked out. You got the same evil rattlin' around in that pretty head. I don't have any evil in me. What I do have is... freedom. You think that I don't check in on my little sis? On you? That adorable little baby? I like the ghost decoration you got on your porch. Very spooky. I hope you rot in here, Diane. It's in your blood! I'll see her real soon! Whoa! - She just fucking attacked me. - Hey, breathe, breathe. - She chopped up her son! - Breathe, breathe. Breathe. Mm-hmm. One, two. Okay. You wanna tell me what happened? She was... She was about to tell me about how she... she saw a woman when she was younger, and my mom saw a woman too, and I've seen a woman. I saw a woman. I woke up in the middle of night and there was a woman in my fucking room and she's trying to make me kill my family. - It's like, oh, boy... - Wait, honey, honey. ...fucking Lizzie Borden is trying to make me - kill my family or something. - Wait, you saw a woman? Mm-hmm. That sounds like a little crazy even for me. Mom! Mom! What the fuck... - The baby's sleeping. - What the fuck's wrong with you? When were you going to tell me? - Tell you what? - You lied to me. She fucking killed him with an axe. A fucking axe? That's insane. Why didn't you tell me? You didn't think maybe I'd want to know? Please just stop talking. - I can't. - Just wait. You lied to me. What about the hallucinations? Aunt Diane said that you had them too. Is that true? No. I just... I don't know, I was just trying to make her feel better. She's my only sister. And I didn't want her to feel... so alone and so isolated. So I just made it up. She was a kid. She had a kid. And then, the whole time she's battling this... disease. So, are you gonna tell me what really happened? So she was... prone to blacking out... from drinking. And I came into her room. And she was passed out on the bed. And there was... an axe... in her hand. And the bedspread was pulled off the bed. And there was... this little bump... underneath the sheet next to her. And there was... blood. Lots of blood. Hello, I'm home. I'm crazy. Please... ...can we keep this our secret? Oh, hey. You know... ...you and your dad have yours, this one will be ours. - Okay? - What? Hello. Are you still my alibi for tomorrow? Uh. Yeah, yeah. Even my mom thinks you're coming over. - I totally sold it. - Good. Check... this bullshit out. - One second. - Give me a beat. - No. - Yeah. You are crazy then. Okay, thank you so much. Tara, I just don't want you to get hurt. I gotta go. Fuck. Tell her. Tell her. Sweetie... Daddy needs time alone. Go watch cartoons. Sweetie, please. I need ten minutes, that's it. Enough. Enough! Told you... Okay, I'm leaving. I'll be back tomorrow. Okay. Tell Suzy's mom I said hi. Okay. Will do. Okay, I'm coming. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Your phone. You're my best friend in the world. - Thank you so much. - Love you. You need something, you can call. Yeah, bye. Dude, what is... what is... what is this place that we're going to? I mean, like, there's a hundred hotels, why you dragging me all the way out here? Tara. Many think it was jealousy. That she lost her father's attention to her step-mom. Was she insane? No one knows. In 1893, she was acquitted of all charges and the murders remain unsolved. Legend has it, her spirit lingers here looking for a new vessel to inhabit. Oh, one second. Remember, breakfast is served from seven to nine. Just go right up the stairs. Okay? I'm so sorry. We're operating a little short today and I am working double duty. Oh! - I really enjoyed listening. - Oh, thank you. - So, are you checking in? - Yes, just one night. Oh. Lucky you. For 60 dollars more, Lizzie Borden's room is available. - Tara. - Yes. - Right. - Really? Yeah, really. A hundred percent really. - Okay, good. Follow me. You bet. - Thank you. Great. - It's right up here. - Shut up. Follow me. And for you, the most coveted room. Oh, my gosh. Old. So there's like no TV? No bathroom? You share, right across the hall. - Oh, great. - It's perfect. Well... if you're interested, we do a candlelight seance at eight o'clock. Now, most of our guests are gonna be going into town for the Oktoberfest, so, it'll probably be just a small gathering... Tara. We'll be there. All right, good. Okay, eight o'clock promptly, and be ready for spooky time. It's her clothes. The dresses? Yes. Lizzie made many of her own clothes. She was an expert seamstress. Well, this blouse... it's a replica of one of her pieces. I always wear it on seance night. Excuse me. I just need to make a phone call. Okay, we start in five minutes. Thank you. Will you do me a favor? Can you go to my house and grab all the old vintage clothes from my room and there's a wooden box in the basement, too. Can you just grab everything from there? Wait, all the... all the frilly old stuff? Yeah. Just grab everything and put it in a trash bag and just take it to your house, please. Just get it out of my house, please. And why? I don't know. It's... It's like a trigger or something. Wait, fuck. What do I tell your mom? Divine inspiration hit, and I want to work on stuff at your house. Sorry. But, you know, the progression of this, right, is you asking me for a body part next. Yeah, well, you already have my heart. I love you. Thank you. I appreciate it. Night. What I try to do is to summon a spirit of the Borden family. We begin. Mm. I call upon the spirits of this house to grant us a moment of your time. I offer my consciousness as a conduit to this world. I beseech all. - I open myself to you. - Tara. I offer... my aura as a path. I call upon Lizzie Borden. Join us at our table. I offer my consciousness - to you. - Tara. Take my hands. It might help. Don't you dare touch me, old bitch. Tara? I killed you once. I'll kill you again. Tara? I knew you were trouble the minute I met you. Trying to replace my mother... stealing my father from me. Tara, please. You're... You're scaring me. If this is an act, I want you to stop. Here you are. Here you are... here I am. It's all so... it's so familiar. Tara? Tara, come back here. Tara? You never loved my father. No, you didn't. I... I... This is an act. This is an act. Was this... Lizzie's axe? - Yes. - Yes. This is my... axe. Please, please. Don't, don't... Tara. Tara, no! Carl! - Watch out! Now! - Are you insane? What the fuck. What's wrong? She was acting like she was possessed. I never met anything in my life. This is just... I don't know. What's wrong? I think... I think I really need help... you know? What if I did something? Hey. Sorry, she's sewing, you know how... - Yeah. - ...she is. She's in, uh, no answer the phone zone now. Yeah. - So, all the clothes? - Yep. I mean, in the basement... behind the furnace. - Okay. - In the back. Thank you. This fucking place. Okay. She's not picking up. I don't know why. Hey, it's Suzy. Leave a message. Hey, call me when you get this. I'm getting... getting kind of worried. Hey, Em. I... Listen, I just want to say I'm... I'm sorry. I... I... I've been crazed with work and, um, haven't been home much, but... No. You know what? No more excuses. Running isn't the way. I know that now. We need to face this, this whole thing. Tara, your sister, this damn curse. All of it. Head on. All right, I'm heading home. We need to talk. Okay. We need to help Tara. Sixty-five-fifty-five, porter on scene. Body identified as missing woman Gina Loeb. Possible dead body inside the house of Mikhail Loeb. I'd say that dress knew it was a downer. Carl, that's Gina Loeb's house. - Is that Suzy's car? - What? Pull up. Pull into the driveway right now. - Pull into the driveway. - Okay. Are you sure somebody's in the house? My mom should be. You know I'll go in there with you. I don't mind getting yelled at. I just want to find Suzy. Hey, it's Suzy. Leave a message. Mom! Caleb! Suzy! What about your dad? Where is he? He's not supposed to be home until later. Just my mom and Caleb. And Jack. - Baby Jack. - Oh, fuck. Wait! Caleb? Caleb? Thank God. - I'm sorry, Tara. - It's okay. I thought I heard a phone. Suzy's in the trunk. She's... She's dead. I thought of Jack. I heard someone coming, so I crawled up here with him. What about Mom? I need you to stay up here, okay? Do you understand? - Say yes. - Yes. Take this. Call 911. Hey, Tara. Come on, come on. - Tara, come on. Come on. - What? Someone's in here. Someone's in here. Tara. Give me that stick. I love you. Hey, sport. What's going... Caleb, hey. Wait, what? No, I can't make out... Caleb, hang on. Who hurt who? What? In the attic? What are you talk... Where's your mom? Put your mom... Where's Tara? Okay, hang on. Caleb, listen to me. Listen carefully. Just... Just stay quiet. Don't move. I'm calling 911. Stay there. No matter what you hear, don't move. 911, what's your emergency? Get away from him! You okay? - Are you okay? - No. I'm not okay. - Fuck! - You're gonna be okay. No. I'm not okay. Fuck! I'm not in the mood right now. Just hold on tight. Come on, Em, pick up. Pick up! Dammit. Goddammit. Oh, my God. Oh, my God, Aunt Diane. No. Hello, Tara. Ugh! Ah! It feels so good. It has been... so long... ...living a lie. Years and years of just... hiding behind all those pills. Mom, why is there blood on you? Dulling the pain. - You don't like it? - Mom, stop. - Let's play a game. - Mom, you're scaring me. Mom? Mom, this is not you. You're my mom. You're Jack's mom. You're Caleb's mom. You're my mom. Okay? I don't know why. I'm sorry. It's okay. You can't fight it alone. I'm not alone, right? I have you. Right? - I love you so much. - I love you, too. You need help, Mom. And I need help. We need help. But what if I don't want help, huh? Get out of the way! You have a little bite, don't you? You have a little bite. Who could play spin the bar. Oh, not you. I think I'm gonna go find Caleb. My little Boy Scout. Oh, and that sniveling baby, too. All he does is cry and cry. He's like the other one. But that one was an abomination. That one... I quieted him. - He was so quiet. - What other one? What do you mean, what other one? You think she did it? No. Do you think she could do it? She can't do anything. No, I did that. I righted the affront to God. I was a good girl. I did that! You see, a child born of incest... nobody wants that. My father betrayed my mother. He's a bad boy, poop. You're a bad girl because you're trying to betray me - with your father. - What are you talking about? - What are you talking... - No, Mom. ...about, Mom? I know what I'm talking about. I see you. I see you. I see you trying to take my place. My place! You cannot take my place. Do you think I'm fucking crazy? Do you think I'm fucking blind? No, I see everything. Everything! But it doesn't matter... because all of you will get what you deserve. Then do it. It's the police. The police! I'm not gonna kill you. Open the door! Okay. - Emily! - Mom! Mom! Mom! No, no, no. Is he gonna be okay? Where's your sister? Upstairs still. Can I start the car? My nine-year-old wants to start the car? Yes. Tara! Tara! Hi. Hey. Hey, I hate to ask... Don't worry. I took 'em. I won't let her get to you. He doesn't even have his seat belt on, but he's about to win his, like, bajillionth Daytona. Yeah! Yes, I won! Hey, thanks.
