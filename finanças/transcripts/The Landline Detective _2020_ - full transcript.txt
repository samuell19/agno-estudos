(light determined music) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Shayna] Hi Grandpa! (perky music) - Oh, hello. Who's this? - [Shayna] Grandpa, it's Shayna! - Shayna? Shayna who? - [Shayna] Grandpa, it's your grand kid. - Grandkid? Oh, that Shayna! (James laughing) - [Lisa] Okay, let Mommy talk to Grandpa. Hurry up and finish eating your breakfast. We're leaving in 10 minutes. So what? Are you treating us out? - Hey, I was up 1500 at one point. - [Lisa] So you lost? - Yeah, damn it. That George, I was on a streak and he wants to eat. - [Lisa] Oh what, he broke the curse? I mean... - Yeah, the luck, something like that. - [Lisa] Anyway. So you took Mom? - Yeah, she should be about halfway there by now. - [Lisa] Anyway, speaking of eating, since I know you're hopeless when it comes to cooking for yourself, and so you'll likely go out and get a plate lunch every night, which will mess up your system, why don't you come over for dinner this week? - Okay, you twisted my arm. What time should I come over tonight? - [Lisa] Oh, anytime after work. - Ooh, what time is that? - [Lisa] Oh yeah, that's right. You don't know what time that is anymore, huh? Around six. Hey, but on one condition. That you and Phil don't start talking about how the country is finally on the right track. Yada, yada, yada, okay? Don't go talking about politics with Phil, you know how he is. - Hey, you're just sore because your candidate didn't win. - [Lisa] No, it's just that when you start, Phil finishes and I gotta listen to it all night long even after you've left. - Well, you should listen to him more. - [Lisa] Oh give me a break. So what, Mom told me you have this great project you're going to tackle. You feeling okay or what? - What, you don't think I can do it? - [Lisa] So you're going to put all the family pictures in photo albums? - Yep, by the time Mom gets back, it'll be all neatly organized. - [Lisa] What? What possessed you to think of doing that? - Eh. I was talking with Harold and he said last year he finally put in the garden that he said he would do for over 20 years. So I thought, what have I ever said that I would do that I never did? - [Lisa] Organizing the family photos? - Well that's the thing. There was nothing that I ever said that I wanted to do for over 20 years, but I might have said something about the pictures. Anyway, the pictures have been around for well over 20 years, so I figured why not? - [Lisa] Well hey, more power to you if you can do it. I don't think you will though. - Hey, thanks for the vote of confidence huh? - [Lisa] No, it's just that it's so much. - Well, you know what they say about how you eat an elephant. Just one bite at a time. - [Lisa] So how many bites are you getting in before Mom gets back? - How many bites? Oh, nobody has the faith! I'm going to eat the whole elephant. You watch. - [Lisa] Okay, bwana. Hey, are you finished? (light perky music) Then take your plate and put it in the sink. Okay, we gotta get going. - Okay. - So come by tonight - and tell me how you did. - Bye. - [Lisa] Bye. (slow perky music) (phone beeps) - [Blanche] Hello James, this is Blanche with Dr. Doyle's office, reminding you that it's time for your next dental appointment. Please call our office at 261-5555 and we'll get you all set up, okay? All right, you have a good day. Thank you. (phone beeps) - [Randy] Yes, hi, this is Randy Vasco with New Hawaiian Solar. This message is for Mr. James Furuta. Mr. Furuta, one of our sales associates communicated to me that you are interested in installing solar panels. Please call me and I'll be happy to tell you of our plans and pricing options. My number is 778-1373. Please call me any time, day or night. I look forward to your call, thank you. (phone beeps) - [Billy] Yes, this is Billy with Toyota's warranty division, calling to tell you about our extended warranty opportunity. The warranty for your Lexus is expiring at the end of next month and I would like to talk to you about the options that are available to you should you want to purchase extended coverage. Please call me at 235-1112, thank you. - Extended warranty? (phone beeps) - [Donna] Hey Uncle, this is Donna! I know you're not home, hope you're having a good time. But I'm just reminding you about the rehearsal dinner. It'll be next Friday. I know Auntie will be away, but if you can make it, that would be great! So when you get back, if you could call me to confirm that you're coming? My number is 306-2443. The dinner is early, we're meeting at four, because Newton has third watch that night, and then he's off until the wedding. Oh, and another reminder about you being our emcee! (Donna laughs) As I said before, we have no backup. Anyway, I'll see you. Take care, bye! (phone beeps) - [Myra] Jimmy, I'm getting ready to board. There's leftover meat loaf from last night in the fridge, (fast perky music) also tossed salad in the large bowl. That ought to last you about three days. Make sure you finish it now. Don't only eat junk food now. I'll call you once I get settled in. If I don't call that's because Carol likely took us shopping. She's picking us up at the airport and Melissa said she had a whole agenda for us planned. - I'll bet. - [Myra] Anyway, don't get obsessed over getting everything done. But I'll be interested to see how far you get. If you just were to organize everything by years, don't have to necessarily put them in albums, that will be plenty, and I can help you when I get back. - Non-believers. - [Myra] Plus the other thing you need to consider is that you have to buy the albums. (fast perky music) - If there's one thing - Which, if we need a lot, - [James] we have an abundance of - are photo albums. - Cost quite a bit. - [James] Over the years, this has been a popular family gift. - [Myra] Okay, I gotta go! Love you, bye! - Oh my goodness. Well won't you be surprised. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Blanche] Dr. Doyle's office. - Hey Blanche, Jimmy Furuta here. - [Blanche] Aye, how's it James? How was your vacation? I hear you went Vegas eh? - Yeah, me and my classmates, we decided to have a reunion. - [Blanche] What, your class reunion this year? No tell me 50 years like me. - Okay, I won't tell you. (both laughing) No, it wasn't like it was this year. We lost a couple of guys from the old gang, so we decided better go more often. - [Blanche] Yeah, I know what you're saying. Life is too short. Well mine is coming up and yeah, it's 50 years already. Can you imagine? - Oh, hard to. So, you still keep in touch with your friends from high school? - [Blanche] You kidding? I was the the coconut wireless at Castle. I knew everybody and everything that was going on, and since then nothing's changed. Everybody still call me up and ask if I heard about so and so, and I usually tell them "Yeah, but did you hear about this!" (both laughing) - Yeah. So when is your reunion? - [Blanche] We're planning it for July. - Ah, that's good. (slow gentle music) Hey, reunions get to be very special, yeah? - [Blanche] Yep. Sad though. Each time get less and less people. - Well, that's what makes it so special yeah? - [Blanche] Yeah, you know, that's so true. - Well, anyway, good to talk to you. - [Blanche] Good to talk to you James. - Hey, so you have a good one huh? - [Blanche] Yeah, I will. And say hello to your wife for me. She's so sweet. - That's what I heard. - [Blanche] Ah you! (both laughing) - Okay, bye bye. - [Blanche] Bye James. (fast perky music) (James laughing) (phone ringing) - [Blanche] Dr. Doyle's office. - Blanche! (James laughing) (both laughing) - [Blanche] No tell me, you were calling to schedule your appointment right? - Yeah. (James laughing) - [Blanche] Hey Jimmy, I'm portagee, I don't know what your excuse is! - Mine is old age. (both laughing) - [Blanche] Oh my goodness! - Oh, no, no, no, no! My excuse is that talking to you is so enchanting. - [Blanche] Yeah right! (both laughing) Oh my God! Okay, 'nuff already. I was just telling the girls I think he was calling because I left him a message about scheduling his appointment. So when would you like to come in? - Oh boy. Well, what you got? - [Blanche] I got next week in the afternoon's pretty wide open. - How 'bout Tuesday, say about one? - [Blanche] Yep, gotcha! Okay, you need a reminder? - Couldn't hurt. - [Blanche] Okay, I'll call you the day before. And you still don't have a cell, right? Just your landline? - Yep. Why break a good habit now? - [Blanche] Aye caross. No cell phone, no email, I don't know if you're an American original or a caveman. - Oh, probably both. (both laughing) - [Blanche] Okay James, we got you down. We'll see you next week. Bye! - Okay, see you Blanche. Bye bye. - [Blanche] Bye. - Ah. Let's just get cracking. (fast perky music) (fast gentle music) (phone ringing) Hello? - [Billy] Hello, may I speak to James Furuta please? - This is him. - [Billy] Oh, hello Mr. Furuta, this is Billy with Toyota's warranty office. How are you? - Oh, I'm fine, thank you. - [Billy] Well, I don't know if you got my message that I left for you last week. - Yeah I did. Sorry, I was on vacation. I can never remember to leave a message on my machine. Actually, I don't know how. - [Billy] Oh no, that's okay. So how was your vacation? - Oh, it was good. You said Billy, right? - [Billy] That's right. - So what's this about Billy? - [Billy] Well Mr. Furuta, the end of next month will make three years that you've had your car, and so the warranty that comes with the vehicle will be expiring. Now warranties are essentially a legal binding pledge to fix or replace any parts that have broken down, or are inherently faulty, including defective parts. What it does not cover is regular maintenance and also any breakdowns caused by accidents, acts of nature, lack of proper maintenance, contamination of fluids or fuels, collisions, fire, theft, negligence or abuse. But, it does include roadside assistance such as towing costs and tire changes, repairing rust or corrosions, and also repairs needed to correct defects in parts that would cause the car not to meet Environmental Protection Agency standards. - So it's kinda like insurance? - [Billy] In a way, yeah. But the difference is that with car warranties, the manufacturer makes a guarantee to the owner of the car that in case the car parts do not function as intended, a warranty will cover the costs to repair or replace the part, as well as car rentals necessary to make those repairs. Insurance, on the other hand, is an obligation on the part of the insurer to take on financial protection or reimbursement for the risks that are inherent with driving. So while there are always exceptions, you can kind of think about it as warranties cover your parts while insurance covers you and your car in case of an accident. - I'm gonna have to think about this a bit more, because I pretty much maintain my own cars. In fact, this is only the fifth car I've ever had, and I've been around since the middle ages. (Billy laughs) - [Billy] Wow, that's pretty good. - Yeah, I've always maintained my cars in pretty good working order. And honestly, this car will probably be my last. - [Billy] Well there you go Mr. Furuta! If this car is the final one, and needs to last. What better way to assure its longevity than to get an extended warranty! - Boy, you were quick on that one. (Billy laughing) - [Billy] I was a defensive tackle in high school. Coach always said "You see any space, "you gotta shoot the gap!" - Yep! Well, I tell you what Billy, I'm gonna have to think about it a little bit and why don't I give you a call say next week? I got a project I'm working on this week. - [Billy] Oh, no worries Mr. Furuta. And would you like me also to follow up with a call to you in case I don't hear from you? Say a couple of weeks before the expiration date? - Wouldn't hurt. - [Billy] Okay, will do Mr. Furuta. And you have a good day, yeah? - Okay, bye bye. - [Billy] Bye. (James sighs) (fast perky music) - [Woman] Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. (electric zinging) (phone ringing) - Hello. (electric zinging) - [Man] I am so glad that I didn't hang up when I got a call just like the one you're getting right now. (slow gentle music) Now, how would you like to have term life insurance for as much as a million dollars for less than what you spend monthly for coffee? Sounds too good to be true? Well it's not. For more information on this. (determined music) (phone ringing) (phone ringing) - Hello? - [Lisa] Dad? - Yes. - [Lisa] You called? - Well, how did you know it was me? (Lisa laughs) - [Lisa] Oh God Dad. - Oh, yeah. - [Lisa] Dad? - Yeah? - [Lisa] Why did you call? - You know I'm finding this organizing the photos to be a lot more difficult than I thought. (Lisa laughs) - [Lisa] Yes, I can imagine it's proving to be quite a challenge. - Yeah. (James chuckles) I'm telling myself, "What did I get myself into?" - [Lisa] Well, how far did you get? - Well, you know, you can't just put 'em into albums as you pull 'em out. You have to spread 'em out first, and then you know, organize them. - [Lisa] You're doing it by, how are you doing it? - Well, I was trying to put them into chronological order. - [Lisa] Oh my goodness! And how far have you gotten? - Well, I don't have 'em in any order yet, I just have 'em out. They're not in any order, just out. - [Lisa] Well, it's like doing a puzzle, right? You first put those pictures that seem to be (electric whining) of the same time period and then get more details later. Dad? - Yeah? - [Lisa] Did you have a question? Why'd you call? Or was that it? - You know, I just can't remember now. - [Lisa] Oh boy. - Well, at least you know I'm giving it the old college try. - [Lisa] Well knowing you, it'll get done. It might take weeks, but you'll do it. - Oh, you're a believer now? - [Lisa] No, I believe you. It's getting it done by the time Mom gets back that I find hard to believe. - Yeah, okay. (electric whining) Well, I better get back to it. - [Lisa] Okay, I'll see you, bye. - Bye. (electric whining) (fast gentle music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) (electric whining) - [Lisa] So what was it? - Remember Mom and I gave you that Polaroid camera when you were, (electric whining) I don't know, nine? - [Lisa] Eight. - Eight. Remember we gave it to you and then you... - [Lisa] Yeah, Audrey Simmons asked to use it and then gave it to some punk guy who wanted to (electric whining) see it works, and it was gone. Yeah, that was tragic. I remember thinking when you and Mom found out you would just be livid. But you never did get angry. - Do you remember how long you had the camera before the boy took it? - [Lisa] Oh, I don't know. It wasn't that long, a week? Can't remember. Two weeks at the most though, why? - No, it's just that I found some photos that you must've took. - [Lisa] You found some photos? Photos of what? (electric whining) - Well, you know, they were mostly scenic stuff. It looks like you were taking shots just to see how it worked. - [Lisa] Oh, I remember that. I remember thinking how amazing it was that you could look at something and then a second later see it appear right before your eyes. So, anything else? - No, I... (electric whining) Actually, yes. You know the reason that Mom and I never got angry with you when you lost the camera? (Lisa laughs) - [Lisa] I didn't lose it! - Now, now, you know what I mean. (slow gentle music) - [Lisa] Dad, so why? Why didn't you guys get mad? - Well, we had a lot going on at that time. The day you lost the camera was the day before Auntie Sarah passed away. - [Lisa] Wait, that's right. I totally forgot about that. That's right. I was afraid of what you guys would say and so I didn't tell you right away. So by the time I did, nobody paid attention because Auntie had died. Yeah. That was why you folks didn't get mad. - Yeah. Anyway, there's one shot of a store down in Heeia, remember? That mom and pop shop? It's located a few miles from... - [Lisa] From Auntie Sarah's house. Yeah, I remember. Uncle John used to take me there when we used to visit. - Well, why were you there? You remember? - [Lisa] Where? At Auntie's place? - No, no, no, the mom and pop store. Somehow you were there and you took this picture. - [Lisa] What are you talking about? There's a picture of the mom and pop store in Heeia? - Well, it's a Polaroid and I remember we gave you a camera, a Polaroid camera just about the time these photos are dated. - [Lisa] Oh, you know what it probably was. I remember that you and mom got the camera for me because I was going to Camp Eisen. That's right. Audrey gave it to some older student after we came back from camp. - Camp Eisen? - [Lisa] Yeah, remember? Mr. Ramsey used to organize those camps and we'd go during Easter vacation. - Oh yeah. - [Lisa] So if you see the mom and pop store, then it must be when we were riding the bus, and either me or Audrey must've taken it. - Riding the bus? Yeah, yeah, yeah. You know you're right. I can see it, yeah. This is taken from a bus while traveling. But it's dark. It looks like it's way after the sun has set. Why is that? - [Lisa] Well, it's probably because we were returning from camp and not going. Because we would leave for the camp in the morning. But coming back it would be in the evening. By the time the bus would return to Kailua, it would be nighttime. That's why we couldn't find that guy. It was crowded. Lots of people greeting everybody, and it was dark. I remember Mr. Ramsey would have the hardest time corralling everybody at the end of camp because no one wanted to leave. And I think he didn't want to leave either. - I don't suppose you remember what day of the week it was when you came back from Camp Eisen? - [Lisa] Actually I do. It was always on a Saturday, because Eisen charges weekly from Saturday night to Friday night. Still that way today. I know because my friend, Jan, she runs a non-profit, she asked me where there was a great place for her organization to have a retreat. I told her to call Eisen and she said that's how they rent the camp. You can go a half week, Saturday to Tuesday, or Saturday to Friday. So yeah, the school camp was always for a week, so we'd come back on a Saturday. Why Dad? What's this all about? - Lisa, this photo is dated March 27, 1982. That's the day before Auntie was found dead in her house. - [Lisa] Yeah, you said that. Okay. Dad, what are you getting at? - Lisa, in this photo I can see Uncle John's car parked up the street near the store. - [Lisa] So, so what? If his car is there, maybe he was getting something at the store. - No, no, I said the car was parked up the street closer to the mountain. It's not parked in the store parking lot. In fact, nothing is parked in the store parking lot. It's empty. The store is closed. I remember the owners used to close up early around five, even on the weekends. Judging from how dark it is, and this is March, it must be about 7:30, maybe even eight. - [Lisa] Dad, I'm afraid I don't know what you're getting at. What are you saying? (tense music) - Auntie Sarah was found murdered in her house on March 28th. Uncle John was away fishing. He came home late Sunday morning and found her strangled in their bed. The house was ransacked. The murderer took jewelry and money. Uncle was away for the weekend. He liked to go fishing near Makapuu. He'd do this, maybe, once a month, they'd leave Friday night and they come back Sunday afternoon. But this time he came back in the morning and he found Auntie dead. - [Lisa] Dad, you're going to have to tell me what you're thinking. - Why, if Uncle is all the way down Makapuu for the weekend, why is his car on this street in Heeia on Saturday night? - [Lisa] Dad, maybe it's not his car. - It is his car. That car was my car before I sold it to him, basically for nothing. I know that it's his car because I recognize the car that I used to have. - [Lisa] What do you want Dad? - I want to know what you think about this. - [Lisa] Did you tell Mom? - I wanted to talk to you first. - [Lisa] I don't know Dad. I think you should mull this over. Let it set. (electric whining) - That car is not going to change when I look at it later. - [Lisa] But what if you're wrong Dad? - I'm telling you, it's, it's... - [Lisa] Dad, you're talking about Uncle! I mean, bad enough Auntie is murdered like that, but then you... - Why is his car there the night before, hm? I mean, why is it there when he said he was at Makapuu? I mean, when they asked him he said he was fishing! Him and his friend! - [Lisa] I don't know! Look, maybe he came back for something. Maybe... - What? - [Lisa] I don't know. Look, I gotta go. I've a meeting I have to get to. Just think about it Dad, okay? Bring it tonight. Bring that picture, show Phil and me, okay? - Yeah. Thanks. (phone ringing) (slow gentle music) (electric whining) Hello? - [Randy] Hello, may I speak to Mr. James Furuta please? - Speaking. - [Randy] Oh, hi, Mr. Furuta, this is Randy Vasco with New Hawaiian Solar. - Oh, hi. Sorry, I was out of town. - [Randy] Oh no worries. What? Vacation? - Yeah. I was on a trip to Vegas. - [Randy] Oh, that's the place! I hope you won. - Oh, nothing to brag about. And actually, I lost. - [Randy] Ah, next time. Shoot, I went up there last year Mr. Furuta, I lost not only my shirt, but my pants too. Lucky I kept my underwear. For real. (James chuckling) Anyway Mr. Furuta, I'm following up on your wanting to get some more information about getting solar for your house. - You know, Randy I was actually hoping maybe we could talk on another day. I'm kind of busy today. I just got back from my trip, I'm going through old mail and... - [Randy] Oh, no worries Mr. Furuta. When is a good time to call back? - Maybe next week? - [Randy] A Week? Oh, not a problem. So that would be next Monday about the same time? - Sounds good. - [Randy] Okay, and you know Mr. Furuta, keep in mind also, if you want me to come over, talk in person, anytime okay? I mean you're in Kailua, we're based in Kahaluu, right near the Hygienic Store, only we're actually up near the mountain by the old Carlton hiking trail. So I'm a skip away and I'm usually on the road anyway, so I can make it over to your place at a moment's notice. Okay? - Okay, sounds good. - [Randy] Okay, take care Mr. Furuta. Bye bye. - Bye. (electric whining) (James sighs) (electric whining) (James sighs) (electric whining) (phone ringing) Hello. - [Lisa] You didn't call Mom yet, did you? - No. - [Lisa] Good, I mean, she's been looking forward to this trip with her friends for so long. She doesn't need this. What about Auntie Janice? - Nope. - [Lisa] Good, I mean, she's got Donna's wedding coming up. ("Wedding March" music) It's just... - I'm not gonna call either of them. I'm still trying to piece this thing together. (electric whining) - [Lisa] Well here's another piece then. - What? - [Lisa] Maybe Uncle was parked there because he was seeing somebody. - What do you mean? - [Lisa] You know, maybe uncle had somebody he was having an affair with? - Uncle John? - [Lisa] Yeah. So when they ask him where he was he can't confess to that. How's it going to look? Not only for him but whoever he was seeing? - So who's he seeing? We don't remember Uncle or Auntie saying they know anybody who lived on that street. - [Lisa] Like Uncle would say anything. - Yeah, but Auntie never said... - [Lisa] Dad, she's the last person he would tell. - True. - [Lisa] Plus, if he's seeing someone, he's not going to park his car in front of her house. Right? - So he parks... - [Lisa] Whoever he's seeing, he's going to park on another street and when it's dark he'll walk over to her place. He doesn't want to park near her house because people will see it and they would talk. - But your Mom and I never heard of Uncle being unfaithful to Auntie Sarah. - [Lisa] Okay, but you never heard of him killing her either. (electric whining) - Well I never said that! - [Lisa] You didn't say that but that's what you're thinking. - So I came upon something I couldn't explain. You provided a plausible theory. - [Lisa] All right, so you okay? - Yeah. - [Lisa] Okay, so we see you tonight then? (electric whining) Did you hear what I said? - Yeah, yeah, yeah. No, no, look. I've all this that I said I would do, but I'm spending all my time on this thing. I haven't even started. - [Lisa] No, just come over, okay? I want to see the picture. - Yeah. Okay. - [Lisa] Okay. I'll talk to you later then. - Okay. Bye. (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Stan] Hello? - Hey, is this Stan the Man? - [Stan] Yes. Who's this? - Hey, blast from the past! This is James Furuta. - [Stan] James? What the hell? Jimmy Furuta? - Yeah. - [Stan] Holy smokes! How are you? - I'm okay, and you? - [Stan] Awe, can't complain. I'm retired, how 'bout you? - Same here. - [Stan] So, what's up? - Well, I have kind of a strange. Stan, I have a question about my brother-in-law. - [Stan] Your brother-in-law? You talking about John? - Yeah. - [Stan] So, what do ya wanna know? - Stan, this is gonna sound strange but I have a reason for asking. (electric whining) - [Stan] Okay. - Stan, you know when his wife... - [Stan] Yeah, I remember. - Is there any possibility (electric whining) that John was, that he was seeing somebody else? - [Stan] What? Where the hell did that come from? - Look, I just came upon this... - [Stan] What the hell Furuta. You're talking, what, what is it? (electric whining) You're talking over 30 years, 35. Why you wanna know? First of all, I don't know anything about that. All right, but what the hell are you asking a question like that for? - I just have a reason. - [Stan] Reason? 35 years later you have a reason? - Look, you were his best man. You were friends in high school, I figured if anybody knows it would be you. - [Stan] Yeah, well, that was 35 years ago. I mean, what kind of question is that? - Look, if you don't wanna say... - [Stan] I just said I don't know anything. So what's this about? - Nah. Nevermind. I just, nah. Don't worry. (Stan chuckles) - [Stan] Don't worry? Yeah, that's a good one. I don't hear from you in over 30 years Furuta and the first thing out of your mouth is asking me if my best friend was cheating on his wife when she was murdered? Yeah right. Hey, so let this be the last call from you, huh? Bye. (James sighs) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Donna] Hi Uncle! - Hey Donna. - [Donna] So, how was your vacation? - Oh, it was good. - [Donna] So you coming to the rehearsal dinner? - Yes, I will be there. (light music) - [Donna] And? - And yes, I remember about the emcee. Hey, you sure you don't have any friends that you would rather have? - [Donna] No Uncle. Like I said, we have no back up. Plus, you are the best! (James chuckles) - Okay. So, how goes the plans? - [Donna] Oh, we're doing good. Except my Mother is so stressed out. - Oh yeah? - [Donna] Yeah, you know, I wish you would've gone to Seattle with Auntie 'cause she's driving me nuts. Hey, maybe you could talk to her. Tell her chill out. - Oh no. I have enough drama with her sister, I don't need to add that. - [Donna] Ah-ha Uncle, I'm gonna tell Auntie! - Hey, you do that, (light music) no emcee. - [Donna] Okay, you got me there. - Okay. Anyway. You hang in there. - [Donna] Okay, thanks Uncle, bye! - Bye. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Stan] Jimmy? Hey, sorry about kind of blowing up there. - Nah, that's okay. I know it caught you by surprise. I don't blame you, really. - [Stan] Still. - Hey, thanks for calling back. - [Stan] What's going on Jimmy? Why you ask me that question? - Stan, look, okay. We haven't talked for a long time, but, I'm gonna tell you something that I hope you will keep in confidence for now. Because I'm having trouble reconciling this. I think I can, but it's gonna mean asking these kinds of questions. - [Stan] I don't know where you're going with this Jimmy, but okay. So what are you saying? - Stan, I just came back from being away for a week. Went to Vegas with some friends. Kinda the guys week away, you know what I mean? My wife and I had this deal. I go away for a week before she goes away for a week with her friends. She's up in Seattle attending some kind of jewelry convention. So anyway, I made it a point to tell her that in the week that she was away I would organize the family photos. So, while I'm going through all that, I come across this Polaroid that my daughter took when she was coming back from camp on the north shore. Now, in the shot she took we see John's car parked on a side street near his house on March 27, 1982. Does that date ring a bell with you? - [Stan] Yeah. - Well, I know you know why, but why? - [Stan] That's the day before he finds his wife dead. - Yeah. So why is his car there? - [Stan] First off Jimmy, how the hell do you know that's his car? - I know the car. You remember who the car belonged to before John? - [Stan] Before John had it? Before John had it. - It was mine. I know what my car looks like. Trust me, it was mine. - [Stan] So what are you thinking? - I don't know what to think. So my daughter throws me this theory. She tells me her Uncle John might be fooling around with somebody in the neighborhood. Maybe not on the street where the car is parked, but some place nearby. So, I'm trying to find out from you what you think about that. - [Stan] Okay, before I say anything I wanna know what you thinking? - Wait, wait. How am I supposed to react to what you just said? What the hell do you know Stan? - [Stan] I wanna know when you see your car, or his car, in a picture dated March 27th, 1982, what are you thinking? - What the hell do you think I'm thinking? My brother-in-law, whose alibi was that he was on the other side of the island fishing, with you! And yet we see his car parked about an hour away from his house. - [Stan] So, you're saying he did it? - I'm asking you Stan. How the hell is his car there when you folks were at Makapuu? - [Stan] Look I don't know anything about that, but I went fishing around the cove, and he went up on the cliffs. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. You guys weren't together? - [Stan] Look Jimmy, you talking about one night over 30 years ago. - Yeah, yeah! Which happened to be the night that you were questioned about over 30 years ago. - [Stan] Okay look, we weren't always together. All right, we weren't catching fish and so when that happens you go looking for a better spot. He went one way, I went another. Not the whole time, but, you know, for awhile. - "For awhile." Like the night of March 27th? - [Stan] Look, I don't know anything about why his car is there, okay? And that's if that's his car. But I know that it's not out of the question that John might have been fooling around. - What? - [Stan] That's all I'm gonna say. - No, no, no, no. Listen, Stan, if you know something you better tell me now! - [Stan] Or else what? - Look, Stan. If you know something, I need to know. - [Stan] What is it to you Jimmy? - What is it to me? What, something has to be personally of value to me before I can know? My sister-in-law was murdered. Strangled. That's something we never got over! Something you never get over! And her murderer was never caught! What? That's not enough for you? That's not enough for me? - [Stan] 35 years. Why don't you let sleeping dogs lie Furuta? And Frankly, it's not any secret that you never liked John in the first place. - Hey, that business is as old as when this tragedy happened. Now, I'm not making this up. I'm just afraid that when I tell his sister, my wife, and her sister, my other sister-in-law, that it's gonna open up the Pandora's box. So, I just wanted to make sure that I work through all plausible reasons before I did so. Now does that make sense to you, huh? So what the hell do you know? - [Stan] Okay. Now I'm only telling you this because talking to you, I'm sensing that what you're thinking, you might be going in the direction that John had something to do with this. The murder of his wife. So because I don't believe he had anything to do with Sarah's murder that I'm gonna say this. But he might have been seeing this woman. Her name was Belle Adachi. - Adachi, Adachi. - [Stan] She was someone he met during high school. He said something about she was in a social club. Somehow after he got married he reconnected with her. - Yeah, (chuckles) reconnected. Yeah, I'll bet. What was her name? Belle? How do you spell that? B-E-L-L-E? - [Stan] Yeah you got it? - So she lived in Heeia? - [Stan] I don't know where she lived. She went to Castle High School, so must've lived in Kaneohe, maybe Kahaluu, maybe, hey, even Heeia. - Did she, was she married as well? - [Stan] I don't know. That's all I know and that's the God's truth. - So you're sure about this? When Sarah was murdered, Saint John was sleeping with somebody else? - [Stan] See, there you go Jimmy. I never said that. You asked for some kind of an idea, I'm giving you an idea. No more, no less. Okay look, I'll leave it at that. You got your own reasons, so whatever. I hope you don't tell anybody how you got the information. Okay. - Stan. - [Stan] Yeah. - Why is his car in that picture! - [Stan] Okay, look, Perry Mason, that's for you to find out. I don't wanna be involved anymore. And so I'll just repeat what I said earlier. Don't call me. And if I'm ever asked, this conversation never happened. (phone clicks) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Blanche] Hello, Dr. Doyle's office. - Blanche, I'm bugging you again. (Blanche laughing) - [Blanche] Not a problem. What you need? To change the appointment? - No, the appointment is fine. Blanche, I have a Castle High School question. - [Blanche] Oh, okay. - Blanche, do you recall a Belle Adachi? She might have been a year or two after you. - [Blanche] No, same year. - Same year? You graduated with her? - [Blanche] Yep. Except, yeah, we graduated together, but that's about it. She ran with a different crowd. - Oh, and what crowd was that? - [Blanche] Oh, the crowd that had their butts moving side to side, their boobs pointed straight, and their nose a mile up in the air. - Yeah, I get the picture. (both laughing) - [Blanche] Oh no, now that I said that you going tell me she's marrying into the family. - No. - Or is it somebody else - [Blanche] who is near and dear to you? - No, I don't even know her. - [Blanche] Oh thank God. Me and my big mouth. You see how I can get into trouble? (Blanche laughing) Oh boy. So why are you asking? - Well, it's just that I was going through the closet and oh, I didn't tell you yeah? I decided to put the family photos into these million albums. - [Blanche] Oh, good luck with that. - Yeah, I hear you. So anyway, I found these photos and found out that it was her and maybe her friends. So I thought maybe I'll find out where she lives and send them to her. - [Blanche] Oh, so somebody in your family does know her then? - [James] No, I didn't say that. - [Blanche] Okay, so? - Well, I just thought you might know what happened to her? She still in the islands? - [Blanche] You know, I could be mistaken, but no, no, no yeah. She actually got married. some haole advertising exec and she moved to the mainland. - Oh yeah? Oh, and when was that? And where did she move to? - [Blanche] Oh that, I have no idea. - And when she moved, was it in the 70s, the 80s, do you think you recall? - [Blanche] James? - Yeah? - [Blanche] What do you really want to know about her? Jimmy, I can just sense that you're trying to find out information that you're not exactly asking about. So what is it, really? (James sighs) - Blanche, nothing personal yeah? But I'm a little concerned about your self-professed prowess at being the go to person for information. - [Blanche] No, no, I know what you saying. Don't worry about that. The other thing I'm good for and my friends will vouch for this, is that I'm also good at keeping secrets if asked to. - Are you serious? - [Blanche] Very. - Okay. Then I'm asking you. - [Blanche] You got my word. - Well, after we last talked I found this photo that was buried for 35 years. A photo that shows my brother-in-law's car parked a few miles from his house, on the night before his wife was found murdered. You know about that right? - [Blanche] Yeah, of course. - Now, if his alibi is that he was nowhere near the house that weekend, then I'm trying to figure out why the hell his car is there that night when it has no business being there. - [Blanche] And you know it's that date? - Yeah, the Polaroid has a date on it. My daughter has this theory that maybe her Uncle was fooling around with somebody in the neighborhood. So he couldn't fess up to his whereabouts because of how it would look for him and the other woman. So I called Stan Takei, his best friend, his best man, fishing partner, and he said something about John seeing a Belle Adachi, and she went to Castle High School. So I thought maybe if he was fooling around with her on that night that would explain things. So I was trying to figure out if maybe she lived in the area. - [Blanche] Jimmy, as far as I know, Belle Adachi got married and left for the mainland. Your sister-in-law was murdered in what year again? - 1982. - [Blanche] 1982. See, that would have been way after she left. I think she got married in 1979 and then I'm sure she left soon after, but I'm not sure. Wow. - Wow what? - [Blanche] This is heavy stuff. - You think? I mean, you can see why I'm concerned, right? - [Blanche] Oh, totally. But again, I'm not sure about when Belle got married and.... ... left. So look, let me make a few calls, I'll get back to you. - Blanche? - No, no, no, don't worry. I'm not going to say anything about why, I'll give some other reason. - Well I hope you're better at it than I am. I mean, I had a game plan with you. I wasn't gonna say anything, but it was over before it even started. - [Blanche] Yeah, well, trust me, I'm better at this than you. I'll get back to you. - Okay, thanks. (phone ringing) - [Randy] Hello, New Hawaiian Solar. - Hey Randy, Jimmy Furuta here. - [Randy] Hey Mr. Furuta, what's up? You wanna meet? - Oh no, no, no, no, next week is still better for me. But I wanted to ask you a question. - [Randy] Sure, anything. What do you wanna know? - Now, this is outside of Solar Randy, but your office is located near what hiking trail again? - [Randy] Oh, the old Carlton hiking trail. - By old, what you mean? That it's closed? - [Randy] Well I think it's still open. It's just that a long time ago they had that accident where all those people were caught in the flood in the river. - Yeah, yeah, they were trying to crossing in the rain. - [Randy] Yeah! - Yeah, and when was that? That was uh... When did that happen? - [Randy] Sheesh, been awhile now. I'd like to think maybe the early 90s. - Early 90s. - [Randy] Yeah, they said the stream became like an ocean because of the rain and the party was swept away (electric whining) and a number of people drowned. - Yeah, and they closed it. Yeah, I remember now. And you said that was in the 90s? - [Randy] I think so. And yeah, they closed it but it did reopen. But somehow, it never got to be that popular anymore. And the access way on our road, well, the city stopped maintaining it a long time ago. so if you want to get to the hiking trail, you can, but it's like you have to bring a machete and cut your way in. - And that hiking trail, the street you're on was not the only access, right? - [Randy] Oh no, no. I think most of the streets in this part of Windward Oahu that lead up from the ocean, you could get up into the mountains. - Uh-huh. And how far did it go? - [Randy] What? - The hiking trail, once you got on it, (electric whining) where did it go? How far? - [Randy] Oh, far. I think you could literally follow that trail along the entire Windward side. Why Mr. Furuta? You thinking about taking the family? If you do, stop by my place, park your car, and I will personally cut you a trail. - Oh, no, no, no, no. (James chuckles) I was just wondering. We got some family visiting maybe next year, so I was thinking about things to do. - [Randy] Well, like I said, anytime you want, give me a call, and we'll cut a way up to the trail. - Wow Randy, thanks. Hey, I look forward to our conversation next week. - [Randy] Okay, glad to be of help. You take care! - Yep. - [Randy] Bye. (determined music) (electric whining) (phone ringing) - [Stan] Hello? - Stan, hold on, hear me out. - [Stan] What the hell Furuta. Hey, this is... - No, no, no, listen! - [Stan] No, I'm telling you, you don't stop harassing me... - Listen! I talked to someone who's pretty sure Belle Adachi didn't live in Heeia. In fact, she got married and moved to the mainland well before my sister-in-law's murder. So I don't think he was there to see her or anybody else. - [Stan] What the hell you trying to do Furuta. Like I said, sleeping dogs. - Stan, back in those days, all the streets went up to the base of the mountain. From there you could get to the Carlton Trail. And on that trail you could go from Kahaluu all the way to Kahuku. Stan, I need to know. I mean you must have asked John. I mean, didn't it cross your mind? - [Stan] Cross my mind what? That my best friend killed his wife? - Did it? - [Stan] I told you not to call Furuta. So this is a warning. You call again and I'll make a call to the cops and they'll call you, okay? You got that Mr. Detective? - The point is, back then he could've easily walked to the end of the street, into the woods, and after a short hike up the ridge, he could've turned and headed towards his house. And after about three miles, he walks down the mountain, out of the woods, onto the street he lived on and heads towards his house. - [Lisa] Dad, you need to stop. - They said Auntie died sometime between the hours of 10 p.m. and two a.m. Now that picture is from about seven, 7:30, so... - [Lisa] Dad. - He waits, maybe an hour. Around eight, 8:30, he gets out, he heads up. By the time he gets there Auntie Sarah is surprised to see him. He says he forgot something. Or maybe he already got something out of the garage. He says he has to use the bathroom. Auntie Sarah has nothing to be suspicious about. She turns her back... - [Lisa] Dad! what's gotten into you? - What's gotten into me? Jesus Christ Lisa! Don't you see? That car cannot be there on that day! If it is, it changes everything! - [Lisa] That's the question Dad. You just said "If." You're talking about a passing shot of a street, in the dark, of a moment in time that happened 35 years ago. Isn't it possible that there's another explanation? Isn't it just possible that maybe that isn't the car? Isn't it possible you're making something out of nothing? - No! There's more of a chance that the camera put the wrong date on the photo than I am wrong about the car. - [Lisa] You are that sure? - Yes! - [Lisa] But even if that was so. Even if that were true, why dad? Why would someone do it? I mean, to kill someone? To kill Auntie? - I don't know. - [Lisa] What are you gonna do? - I guess I'll do what most people do when they come up with a situation that they have no idea how to handle. - [Lisa] What's that? - [James] They talk to people. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Myra] James? - Yes. - [Myra] I talked to Lisa. What picture are you talking about? - Well, if you talk to her, and... - [Myra] James, a Polaroid from 35 years ago? - Myra, John's car is in the photo. In Heeia, on the day before Sarah was murdered. Why? - [Myra] You must be mistaken. - I am not mistaken. It's his car! And it's on the day before. Aren't you even curious as to why? - [Myra] What does it matter at this point? - What does it matter? What does it matter? Don't you care? - [Myra] Why should I care about something that is long ago and won't change anything? - Won't change anything? Your sister's murderer, Janice's sister's murderer has never been caught! - [Myra] You didn't tell Janice did you? - Didn't tell Janice? I didn't tell you! But you don't care about something that has an obvious connection to Sarah's murder? - [Myra] James! She's dead! What will anything do at this point except open up old wounds? - I'm trying to process what you just said. I'm basically questioning the innocence of your sister's former husband, and you're fighting me by saying that you don't wanna deal with it? - [Myra] That's not what I mean. - Well what do you mean? - [Myra] James, I just don't believe John would be capable of it. You saw him, you saw what he went through. There's no way he could've done it. - Jesus Christ, Myra! You're making a purely emotional argument. I'm basing my argument on facts. My God damned car is there for a reason. - [Myra] But why? - Why am I still doing this? We're still talking about the... - [Myra] No! Why would he kill her! They were so much in love, so happy! (electric whining) Why would he do it? James, I have to go. Gladys and the others are calling me. I'll call you later. Until then, don't do anything rash! And please, whatever you do, don't bring this up to Janice. She's so happy about Donna finally getting married... - Hey, - she would... - I didn't tell you, remember? - [Myra] Okay. (slow gentle music) - Look, I'm sorry that I spoiled your vacation. I didn't mean to. - [Myra] Jimmy, I know it's important to figure this out. But I guess it was such a horrible time. So much pain! Pain that in reality you never get rid of. Never quite get over. You just learn to live with it So all this. Well, I guess I just didn't wanna go back there. - I understand. I'm sorry. - [Myra] Do what you have to do James. We'll talk when I get back. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Man] I am so glad that I didn't hang up when I got a call just like the one you're getting right now. - Oh crap, insurance. - [Man] Term life insurance for as much as a million dollars (light determined music) for less than what you spend monthly for coffee. Sounds too good to be true? Well it's not. For more information on this, please press one and you will get an offer that will amaze you. That's right, guaranteed life insurance for up to one million dollars with no medical exams. So to reserve your spot for this limited time offer, again, press one now. - Insurance. - [Man] If you wish to be taken off our call list, press two. (phone ringing) - [Harry] Hello. - Hey Harry, how's it? Jimmy Furuta here. - [Harry] Hey, Jim, how goes it? - Okay. How's my insurance man? Having fun? - [Harry] Well, you know what they say about fun and insurance right? - Oh, what's that? - [Harry] The older you get, the more it costs. (James laughs) - Harry, how long you been selling insurance? - [Harry] Shit, longer than the sun been rising it seems. You were one of my first clients, that give you any idea? - So, what? 40 years? - [Harry] Whoa, I'm flattered. More like 50 I mean. I started in 1970, so what is that, 47 years? - Jesus. Aren't you ever gonna retire? I mean, not that I'm complaining. - [Harry] If I retire, what am I gonna do? Go to Vegas? - Well, there are worse things. - [Harry] I cannot. See, insurance is like the house yeah? I'm so used to being the house, I wouldn't know what to do being the player. So what can I do for you Jimmy? I'm sure it's more than knowing my work history. - Harry, I got an odd question. Remember when my sister-in-law was murdered? What do you suppose the insurance payout would be that my brother-in-law got? - [Harry] Yup. - Yup what? - [Harry] That's just about the oddest question I've heard in a long while. Why are you asking? - I got a reason. - [Harry] Well you know I wouldn't know. - Well, I know you wouldn't know, but I thought maybe you would know somebody who did. You know, when it pops up in conversation. Confidential kind. You know, the kind that only salesman who are really good friends would share? - [Harry] Why you wanna know Jimmy? - Am I right? That the information is available? - [Harry] I'm not saying. - Well I know you're not saying, but you're not not saying. - [Harry] I don't know Jimmy. If I didn't know you as well as I do, I would say this conversation is not only a little odd, but getting a whole lot of strange. What are you asking me? - I wanna know how much my brother-in-law got from Sarah's insurance company for her death. - [Harry] Why? - Okay. If I tell you why, can I count on your confidentiality? - [Harry] Well, you know Jimmy, what you're kind of asking me to do, is if I knew any information. You want me to breach a confidential matter and be confidential about it. - Harry, I'm just asking off the record. - [Harry] Well I think I heard about all I need to hear. Listen Jimmy, you're a good guy, but so is my reputation. Plus, I'm too old to be chasing ghosts. If you need information, why don't you contact the guys who were doing the investigating. Sorry, I can't help you. - Understood. - [Harry] Bye. - Bye. (gentle determined music) - [Donna] Hey Uncle! - Hi Donna! Is Newton around by any chance? - [Donna] Newton? No, he's working. He's on his watch right now. - Ah, okay. Do you have his number? I have a question to ask him. - [Donna] Oh sure, his number is 780-3434. - [James] 780-3434. - [Donna] He's on duty now, so I don't know if he can return your call. - You know what Donna, can you call him and ask him to call me? I mean, since he wouldn't recognize my number anyway. - [Donna] Sure. Can I tell him what it's about? - I have a friend who has a grandson who's interested in joining the police force. So I told him I would ask Newton some questions. - [Donna] Okay, I'll call him right now. - Okay, great! Thanks! - [Donna] Bye! - Bye! (phone ringing) Wow, that was fast. - [Janice] James. - Who? Janice? - [Janice] Yeah. James, did Donna ask you about doing the bonsai? - Jesus, I'm doing the emcee. What, I should conduct the ceremonies? - [Janice] No, it's just that I don't know what is going on. They say they have it all under control but I'm not sure. - Janice, relax. The kids have got it. - [Janice] I don't know. - They got it, just relax. - [Janice] Yeah, it's so hard though. I want everything so perfect. You know, funny, you know what I've been thinking about lately? - What's that? - [Janice] I was thinking how my sister Sarah, they never had kids. (slow gentle music) I don't know why, but I almost have this guilty feeling. She never got this chance you know? To be a mother, to help plan her daughter's wedding. Silly huh? - Nope. Not silly at all. - [Janice] Well anyway, like you said, I'm sure they have it handled. Thanks. I'll see you James. - Janice. - [Janice] Yeah? James? - Enjoy yourself. Sarah will be there in spirit. - [Janice] Yeah, I'm sure she will. I'll see you James, bye. - Bye. (phone ringing) Geez. Hello. - [Newton] Hey Uncle, how's it, Newton. Donna said to give you a call? - Hey Newton, thanks for calling. So, you on the road? - [Newton] Oh no, right now I'm back at the station. I have to write up some reports, then I'm gonna pick up something to eat and then go back out. So what's up? Donna said somebody wants to join the force? - Yeah. Actually Newton, that's not what I called about? - [Newton] Hey, you're gonna be our emcee right? - Oh yeah, of course! We can talk about that more at the rehearsal dinner. - [Newton] Oh yeah, right on. Thanks man, we appreciate it. - Yeah. Newton. I wonder if you could do me a big favor. - [Newton] Shoot, anything. - I think you heard about what happened to our family back in 1982. It was a pretty famous Hawaii case. My sister-in-law was murdered. - [Newton] Yeah, I know, I'm sorry Uncle. - No, no, no. So Newton, I was hoping you could find information for me about the detective who was on the case. His name I think was Copeland? I think his first name I believe was Thomas. - [Newton] Okay, ah, 1982, hmm... Uncle, I think he might be retired already. Because I know most the detectives now. - Oh no, no, no, I know that Newton. But I was wondering if you could get his home number so I can call him. Assuming he's still in the islands. - [Newton] Well I can try. I'll head over to personnel, but I don't know. - Newton, I know this is gonna sound strange, but I just have a question I wanna ask him about the case. Something popped up that for some reason I never thought about asking. And I don't wanna get you into trouble, okay. So maybe somebody could just contact him and tell him I have a question and he can call me? - [Newton] Okay. - Newton, I'll tell you what it is. I came upon this photo of a car that belongs to Donna's Uncle John that's parked in Heeia the night before her Auntie Sarah's murder. Thing is, there's no way that car is supposed to be there. For his alibi was that he was over by Makapuu. And I need to talk to Copeland about this. - [Newton] Wow, Uncle. - I know, I know Newton. I should probably talk to somebody in the department that I'm supposed to talk to, but let me deal with Copeland first, okay? I mean, who knows, there might be some logical explanation for all this. But, either way, I'll probably ask you again for help afterwards. - [Newton] Okay Uncle, I'll see what I can do. - Thanks. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Blanche] I got a number for Belle Adachi. - What? What is it? - [Blanche] 619-676-4828. - 619-676-4828. - [Blanche] You got it. - Where is this, California? - [Blanche] I think San Diego way, or thereabouts. - How'd you get the info? - [Blanche] I called a friend who knew a friend who knew a friend. You heard of sex degrees of separation? - Yeah. - [Blanche] Well, this one was more like nine. - Geez. Thanks. - [Blanche] Yeah well, it's one thing to get the info, another thing to do something with it. I mean, what do you say to her James? - I don't know. I guess I'll (electric whining) cross that bridge when I'm standing on it and it's breaking and I'm falling into the ravine. - [Blanche] Jimmy, I know that this thought might have crossed your mind. - What? Why don't I just call John? It has, like constantly. But what am I supposed to say? Hey John, by the way, did you kill your wife? - [Blanche] Well I know that's a big jump, but it can't be much bigger than that ravine you're going to cross with Belle Adachi. Which, by the way, her name is Thompson, Belle Thompson. - Thompson. Okay. (James sighs) (gentle music) I don't know Blanche. I'm taking it like minute by minute. I mean, this morning I get up with the notion that I'm gonna assemble the family history. And then a few hours later I'm making like Sherlock Holmes trying to solve an infamous murder. I mean, am I nuts? - [Blanche] No. After all, we're not talking about whether somebody gave you $20 or $40 for your kid's wedding, so you want to make sure you reciprocate at least the same. You're talking about whether the killer of your sister-in-law was lying right under your nose all this time, and he happens to be your brother-in-law. It's a pretty heavy dose of the surreal if you ask me. I don't envy you. - Yeah, I don't envy me either. Yeah, but thanks Blanche. Thanks for everything. I'll let you know how it goes. - [Blanche] Okay, you take care James. - Thanks. Bye. (phone ringing) Is it me, or has this place turned into information central? Hello? - [Tom] Hello, may I speak to Mr. James Furuta please? - Who is this? - [Tom] Is this James? - Yes, who are you? - [Tom] This is Tom Copeland, I was told that you wanted to speak to me. - Tom. Oh, Tom Copeland with the police department! Yes! Thank you for calling. You know, I really appreciate it. I know that you must be very busy. - [Tom] Well, not really. I've been retired for a long time, so. What is it you wanna talk to me about regarding the Sarah Izumi case? - Well, first of all, I don't know that you are aware of my relationship with the... - [Tom] Yes, I remember who you are. We never met, but I know that Izumi was your sister-in-law. Your wife was Sarah's older sister. - Oh, anyway, I recently came upon something that I think has some relevance to the case. But first, I wanna ask a question. It's one of those things that you never think about asking. I mean, you might wonder, but you never quite ask. I mean, this whole thing is something all of us, my wife, John... - [Tom] I understand, what's your question James? - What kind of insurance money did my brother-in-law get when Sarah died? - [Tom] Insurance. (electric whining) James, any man that asks that of a detective, who headed up one of Hawaii's great murder cases must be looking for a motive. So are you saying you think John Izumi murdered his wife to collect on her life insurance? - It did cross my mind. - [Tom] Well, I'd have to check my file to be sure. Which is back in police archives, but why does this cross your mind after all these years? - Tom, 35 years ago my daughter was about eight at the time, was coming back on a bus from a camp on the north shore. And she was shooting scenery shots with her Polaroid camera. Now back then, the Polaroid shots had dates on them. I found this photo this morning when I was organizing the family photos. In this photo, we see John's car parked a few miles from his house on the day before Sarah was murdered. Tom? - [Tom] I'm here. You sure about this? - On Sarah's grave I'm sure. - [Tom] We should meet James. I'll make a call to the department and ask if someone could pull the file and find out how much insurance Sarah had. Normally I would remember everything, but... - It's been 35 years, I know. - [Tom] Yeah. I'll make a call and find out. - You can do that? - [Tom] What do you mean? - I mean you're retired and all. - [Tom] Yeah, but there's no statute of limitations for murder. And no denying an old detective like me from getting what he wants if he wants something. - Okay. - [Tom] James, why don't you scan that photo and email it to me? - Tom, you're gonna think I'm a dinosaur, which I am, seeing as how even you have email, but I'm what you call technology challenged? I don't have email or even a cell phone. But I'm gonna see my daughter tonight and I'm sure she can scan it to you. What's your email? Like the metal, only I use it because of what I used to be. TC for my initials at... Got it! I'll get this to you tonight. Hey, look, what do you think about all this? - [Tom] Well, let's see where this goes first. - No, I mean, assuming I'm right, and I know I am, and that is his car, what do you think? - [Tom] What do I think? Well obviously it's a game changer. And it would validate what I was thinking. (determined music) - What do you mean? - [Tom] Well, there was something that always stood out about that weekend. - What was that? - [Tom] My years of experience taught me that usually the solution to a crime would be found by finding the changes in behavior patterns. From what we learned, every time they would go on their weekend jaunts, John and his buddy always would come back with fish, some times more than others, but always they would bring home something. But on that weekend there was no fish. Why? - Yeah. John came home early that day. With no fish. Why? - [Tom] Why do you think? - Because he wasn't there fishing. He was someplace else. - [Tom] Of course, they had a reason for it. Actually you know what? I could use the exercise. I'll go to the station instead of calling. I'll call you when I'm there. - Okay. - [Tom] Bye. (phone ringing) - [John] Hello? Hello? Hello? - John. - [John] Yes. Who's this? - James. - [John] James? Oh, hey, how you doing? What do you want Jimmy? - That weekend back in 1982, why didn't you catch any fish? - [John] What are you talking about? - When you used to fish out at Makapuu, I remember you used to always catch something. So how come that weekend you didn't catch anything? - [John] What the hell you want Jimmy? - Because you weren't at Makapuu that whole weekend. At least not on the night of March 27th. - [John] What the hell are you saying Jim? - When Lisa was eight, we gave her a Polaroid camera. Out of all the random shots that she took the week that she was at Camp Eisen, she took a picture when they were coming back home from camp. In that picture is your car parked by that store in Heeia, just as the light of day was fading. Just at the time when you said you were on the cliffs of Makapuu. - [John] What? You're saying my car was, my car? My car was in... - Cut the crap John! Why, when you told everyone that you were at Makapuu for the weekend, why was your car in Heeia? (phone clicks) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Belle] Hello? - Hello, may I speak with Belle Adachi please? - [Belle] Belle Adachi? - Yes. Oh, no. Belle Thompson. - [Belle] Yes, this is she. - Hi Belle. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, you don't know me. I'm calling from Hawaii. - [Belle] Oh, is this about the reunion? It's 50 years this year, right? - No, no, no, no. But it is about the high school days. Or around that time. - [Belle] Yes, who is this? - This is James Furuta. - [Belle] James? - No, no, no, I didn't go to Castle. I'm sorry, you don't know me. I got your name from somebody and I was hoping that you could help me with something. - [Belle] Yes. - Belle, my brother-in-law is John Izumi, his wife was Sarah Izumi. - [Belle] I see. - Do those names ring a bell with you? - [Belle] Yes, but why are you telling me about that? - Belle, I don't know if I can justify the question that I'm going to ask you, but trust that I have a reason. - [Belle] What do you wanna know James? - Belle, I've come across some evidence that confirms that my brother-in-law was in the neighborhood of his home the night before his wife was murdered. When he says that he was on the other side of the island. And so I've been talking to people, asking around, asking them why. And his good friend, Stanley Takei, well... - [Belle] Stanley Takei. - God. Yeah. He put forth a theory if you will. - [Belle] He did, did he? - I take it from your tone that you knew Stanley or know Stanley. - [Belle] I knew him, yes. And what theory are we talking about? - Now Belle, this is just something I have to ask, and once I've asked it I'll be out of your hair. - [Belle] I'm waiting. - Belle, one reason that was given for John's car being in the neighborhood was that he was seeing you. - [Belle] Seeing me, like in... - Yes, I'm sorry. Is there any truth in that? - [Belle] James, I knew John from just a couple social club meetings that we went to and that was it. And that's the truth! I learned of that tragedy after I had already moved to California! - Thank you Belle. I'm so sorry to bring this up so many years after. Actually, you didn't tell me anything that I didn't already think. I just had to ask. Thank you for... - [Belle] Of all people to suggest such a thing! - Pardon me? What do you mean by that? - [Belle] Listen, John was always a gentleman. That Stan, he was something else. He was a lech. All us girls used to say his name shouldn't be Takei, it should have been tako, for octopus. Because that's how he was with all the pretty girls! (electric whining) All arms! Look, I... Is there anything else I can do for you? - Oh, no, no. You've been... I'm sorry to have asked. Thank you Belle. You have a good life, okay? (phone ringing) Hello? - [Tom] James. - Tom. - [Tom] Sarah Izumi didn't have any life insurance. - You sure about this? - [Tom] On Sarah's grave. - Well, I've actually done a lot since we last talked. - [Tom] Yeah, like what? - Like I finally called and talked to John. - [Tom] Okay, what did he say? - Well, as you can imagine, it didn't go well. It was like he was hit by a train. - [Tom] Uh-huh. - You know how sometimes you just can't find the words because you're totally blindsided? - [Tom] What'd you tell him? - I told him, I said, "Why is your car in Heeia "the night before?" - [Tom] And what did he say? - I don't know, I was emotional. What little adrenaline is still in this old body was pumping. I think he just repeated what I said. Yeah, yeah. That's basically what he did. He did it! I can feel it in my bones! But is this photo enough to do it? - [Tom] You're that convinced? - Yeah, And I'll tell you something else. My daughter had a theory that maybe John couldn't say why he was in Heeia because he was there fooling around with somebody. So I looked into that. I got a tip about who it might've been. And so I called her up. It's a woman who lives in San Diego. She said she moved to the mainland way before Sarah's murder. And I believe her. - [Tom] So let me ask you. All these years, you never suspected anything? I mean, okay, if that's his car, yeah it changes everything. But you're telling me these thoughts never swirled in your head before? Never ever? - No. - [James] He's family, right? I mean, you don't wanna doubt him. You wanna believe his story. All these years. Hey, you mentioned something about breaking his pattern. You know, not coming home with any fish. And you said that he had an explanation. What was it? - [Tom] Well, John couldn't of done it because he didn't have his car. - What do you mean? - [Tom] John and Stan used to trade off driving. One would go all the way (electric whining) to the other's house and pick the other up. That week John drove, but they both agreed that they would always bring their share of the bait. John said that in the evening of March 27th, after they finished with his bait, the realized his buddy Stanley had forgotten to bring his share. So they're only halfway through the weekend and they have no bait. John was really upset over this so Stan volunteered to go back up the cliff and take John's car and go get some. But on the way there he had a flat, which he said took him a while to fix because he inadvertently (electric whining) kicked one of the lug nuts into a rocky crevice to the side of where he pulled over, which then took him some time to eventually dig out. By the time he was back on the road, all the stores he wanted to go to for the kind of bait they used were closed. Stan said he knew John would be mad, so after realizing no stores were open, he went all the way back to his own house to see if he had any leftover fish in his freezer. Which he didn't. So when he finally came back and told John, of course, John wasn't too happy. (electric whining) He had caught two fish, but because they didn't wanna cut the weekend short, they decided to use their catch as bait to keep fishing. Of course, by then it was four in the morning. Long story short, they ran out of bait again, and by then they had nothing to show for it. So rather than stay until the afternoon as they usually did, they came home early. John first dropped off Stan and wanted to come home early because he wanted to get a replacement for his flat tire. It was Sunday, and the place where he bought his tires opened only half day. - Jesus H. Christ! Oh God. - [Tom] What are you thinking? - What am I thinking? Jesus Christ! I should've listened to my daughter! She said, "Wait a while, mull it over. Maybe things will get clearer later." Jesus. - [Tom] What are you thinking James? - Christ Tom! I just about called my brother-in-law a murderer! I called a woman in San Diego who, I don't even know, and I suggested that she... Oh God. - [Tom] I repeat. What are you thinking? - What the hell do you think I'm thinking? - [Tom] Why is John's car in Heeia on that night? - Well, that's obvious! Stan went back to the mom and pop store to buy more bait! - [Tom] But the mom and pop store used to close early. - Well, okay. I knew that. But, well like you said, he realized it, and he went back home. - [Tom] So, he goes to Heeia, and not finding the mom and pop store open, he goes all the way back to Aiea? - Aiea? - [Tom] Yeah, that's where he lived. That's where he still lives, I believe. You see, the fact is Stan Takei didn't go back to the Windward side. He said that he went into town in search of his bait and then had the flat which delayed him, and not finding any of the stores opened, he went all the way back to his house in Aiea. So according to his story (electric whining) he was nowhere near Heeia. (slow gentle music) - [Belle] For Stanley Takei to accuse me of fooling around, (scoffs) that's a good one. - What are you saying Tom? - [Tom] I'm saying it's not whose car is parked in Heeia. (thunder rumbling) It's who was the driver (electric whining) of that car. (gentle music) - [Belle] Listen, John was always a gentleman. That Stan? He was something else. He was a lech. All us girls used to say (electric whining) his name shouldn't be Takei, it should have been tako, for octopus. - [John] What? You're saying my car was, my car? My car was in... (thunder rumbling) - [Stan] What the hell are you trying to do Furuta? Like I said, sleeping dogs. - [Tom] You see James, I never suspected John. It was Stan Takei who I felt murdered Sarah Izumi. - My God. - [Tom] I'm going to go and see the boys in homicide and give them a heads up. I'll call you later. (phone ringing) - Hello. - [Myra] What did you do? - What? - [Myra] You called John. - Well how'd you know that I... - [Myra] What did you say to him? - Wait, what's this about? - [Myra] His wife, Amelia, (electric whining) she called and she's hysterical! She said he said he talked to you and then he got all upset. She said he went up to their attic, got his old gun he had from when he was in the military and he just left... - Oh my God! - [Myra] Saying he was going to kill somebody! Kill who? What is she talking about? What did you tell him? - Look, Myra, I gotta go! I'll get back to you! - [Myra] James! - I'll explain later, I'll get back to you! (electric whining) Awe damn, I don't have his number! Wait, I do. Ah. (phone beeping) - [Newton] Hello. - Newton! - [Newton] Hey Uncle, did that guy... - Yeah, yeah, he did, he did. Listen, I need to get his number. I talked to him but I didn't get his number. - [Newton] Oh actually Uncle, I didn't call him, personnel did, let me call him. - Newton, Newton, that's okay, that's okay! I need you to. Actually, are you still at the station? - [Newton] No, I'm back on patrol. - Great! (determined music) Newton, I have reason to believe that Uncle John is en route to a man's house who he believes killed his wife. So I need you to get as many police officers over there as soon as possible. Newton! - [Newton] Where Uncle? - In Aiea. Wait, let me get you the address. Newton! - [Newton] Yeah, I'm still with you, I'm turning. (sirens wailing) Give it to me! - 839 Kinako Street. - [Newton] Got it. - Newton, call me when you're there. Let me know what happened. - [Newton] Copy that! (determined music) (electric whining) (James sighs) (electric whining) (determined music) (phone beeping) (phone ringing) - [Stan] I am not able to take your call at this time. At the sound of the beep, please leave your name and number and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. (phone beeping) - Stan! Pick up the phone! Stan, if you're there, pick up the phone! John is headed your way and he is armed! So for God's sake pick up the phone! - [Stan] What the hell you talking about? - Hey, it was you wasn't it Stan? You forgot the bait on purpose so you had an excuse to leave! I bet you punctured the tire on purpose! You didn't actually go back to town did you, huh Stan? You went back to Heeia. You went back to John's house. - [Stan] You're out of your mind. (gun firing) (Stan screams) (determined music) John! - What the hell was that? - [Stan] What the hell are you doing? Please, John, put the gun down! - You killed her! - John, no! - [Stan] Put the gun down and we can talk! - You killed her! - You killed her! - John! - John! - Please! - [Stan] It was an accident! I didn't mean to. I went over to... - [John] What did you do to her! - [Stan] I'm sorry John! I misinterpreted things, all right. She was always smiling. I don't know, I thought she liked me. I'm sorry! She started saying she was gonna call the cops! I told her I was sorry but she wouldn't listen! I just wanted to hold her, say I was sorry, but she slapped me John and I guess I just went crazy. - You! - [Stan] No, John, no! Please, I didn't mean to hurt her! I swear! Please don't shoot me! - John, John, John! Listen to me! Listen to me John! - [Stan] Yeah John, talk to your brother-in-law! Jimmy Furuta, he's on the phone. Talk to him right now. - [John] Jimmy? - John. Please. Look... - [John] It was him all along Jimmy! - I know John. The police are on their way, so please John... - [John] He needs to pay for this! - He will John. Look, don't let him do this to you! Think about Amelia, think about your family! Think about them. (electric whining) - [John] I had a whole life ahead of me Jimmy! My whole life! And he took it from me! - John! - [John] No! - No, no John! (man grunts) John! (gun fires) - [Tom] Put the gun down John. - [Stan] Please, help me! - He's alive. - [Tom] Give me the gun John. - It's Tom. - [John] He murdered my wife! - [Tom] We know, and he'll pay for it now. Just give me the gun. - [Tom] Yes. - Tom. (electric whining) Tom! - [Tom] All right boys, take Mr. Takei into custody. Murder one. Read him his rights. Everything will be all right John. - [Newton] Hello? - Who? Newton! - [Newton] Hey Uncle. - Newton, you guys all right? - [Newton] Ah yeah, it was pretty touch and go there though. - Is that Tom Copeland over there? - [Newton] Yeah, you wanna talk to him? - Please. - [Newton] Detective Copeland! - [Tom] Officer, you file the report. We'll all write what we heard. Hello? - Back on the force? - [Tom] I couldn't stay away. This case has haunted more than a few James. It's been a great void of my life. - Yeah, I know what you mean. Hey, how'd you get over there? How'd you find out about it? - [Tom] I was in homicide when the APB from your soon to be nephew came on the blotter. Force of habit I guess. - I can't believe it. He didn't shoot him. - [Tom] But John was thinking about it, all right. You wanna talk to him? - Talk to, to John? - [Tom] Yeah. (electric whining) - Yeah. Please. (slow gentle music) - [John] Yeah? - John. I'm sorry. I don't know what I was thinking. I hope you can forgive me. - [John] She was the light of my life Jimmy. When he took her, he plunged me into darkness. A darkness I thought I'd never escape from. - Go home John. Amelia is worried. Justice will be served. The police will do their job, so you do yours. Call Amelia, let her know that you're okay and that you're coming home. - [John] Okay. - I called everybody. Mom, Auntie Janice, Blanche at Dr. Doyle's office, Belle Thompson in San Diego, Newton was gonna tell Donna. I even called and explained everything to Harry, my insurance guy. So he wouldn't think I was getting weird in my old age. So yeah, you're the last. - [Lisa] Well thanks a lot. - Hey, figured I was gonna see you tonight. Oh, and Copeland still wants the photo. Even though Stan Takei signed his confession. - [Lisa] Wow Dad, this is unbelievable. Well, come over. I'm making dinner right now. - Now that you mention it, I haven't eaten anything all day. So yeah, I could eat. - [Lisa] I think you were pretty occupied. My God Dad! You solved Auntie Sarah's murder by just calling people on your old landline phone! - Yeah. Copeland calls me the Landline Detective. - [Lisa] Surreal, absolutely surreal. Hey, remember you mentioned that you wanted to work on something that you hadn't been done for 20 years? Well, you actually did. - Guess you're right. - [Lisa] Guess you don't have to work on the family photos anymore huh? - No, I'll get back on it tomorrow. And barring any other mysterious photos, I aim to still get it done. (Lisa laughs) - [Lisa] Hey, Shayna wants to talk to you. - Shayna. - [Lisa] Talk to Grandpa, hurry. And then you have to go take a bath. - Hello? - [Shayna] Hi Grandpa, what ya doing? - Oh, well, I'm talking to you. - [Shayna] No, what did you do today? - Well, you know, I talked to people all day. - [Shayna] Well, you have to get out more often Grandpa. (James chuckles) - So true. - [Shayna] So when are you coming over? - I'm gonna leave right now. - [Shayna] Okay, bye bye. - Bye. (determined music) (slow paced music) (light gentle music)
