Any number divided by the same number will result in the number 1. For instance, 3 divided by 2 is 1. 1000 when divide by 1000, will again yield the result 1. What does this mean? If 1000 mangoes are distributed among 1000 people, each person will get one mango. Isn't that right? - Yes, sir. If zero is divided by zero, will the result be 1, sir? If zero mangoes are distributed to zero people, will each person get one mango? Zero has no value, you precocious child! How is that, sir? The value of every number in Mathematics is increased only because of zero. For instance, the value of 1 is just 1. If we add a zero next to it, 1 becomes 10. If we add yet another zero to it, it becomes 100. And if you say, a zero has no value, how can I believe it, sir? [Kids laughing] "Hare Gopala..." "Mukunda..." "Hare Govinda..." "Thousands of names of You" "My tongue is never tired of chanting those names" "His never ending tales spread His fame far and wide" "One who worships Him every day, is rid of all sufferings and pain" "Hari Narayana... Narayana..." "Hari Narayana... Narayana..." "Hari Narayana... Narayana..." "Hari Narayana... Narayana..." "He is the Supreme God who lifted a mountain on his tiny finger" "Narayana... Narayana..." "He brought down rain to bless us all, He is the savior" "Narayana... Narayana..." "You're the God who prevails in even darkness" "You showed a mother the entire universe inside your mouth." "Narayana... Narayana..." "Narayana... Narayana..." [Music] "When Duryodhan decided to triumph over the Gods" "there was none other than You who came to save this world" "Kurukshetra, the battleground became a place where you disclosed" "the holy Gita to enlighten your believers" "When Panchali... "When Panchali cried out for help," "you showered her with silk robes" "Your miracle saved her from being dishonored" "You saved her from such embarrassment, Krishna Mukunda" "You were born to Devaki at midnight, O Madhusudhana..." "Narayana... Narayana..." [Music] "The whole world is as round as a zero, You rule us all" "I have seen Your magnificence and your fame" "Other than You, there is no happiness, beginning or eternity" "I asked myself many questions to seek answers" "Your divine plays..." "Are we not aware of your divine plays?" "Are we ignorant of your mischiefs?" "You are the only One I trust, bless me, O Lord" "You are my sole teacher, my guide" "You show me light and guide me through thousand problems" "Narayana... Narayana..." "Narayana... Narayana..." Where are you going? Pattar Samy... - What is it? It's very important. There are 142 visitors today. The sweet dumplings you have here, are only 137. The last 5 people will not get any sweet dumpling. The 'Sundal' container you have, is similar to the one we have at home. This can hold tentatively around 8710 peas. While giving a fist full of peas, you're giving each one 65 peas. If you continue this, 8 people in the end will be deprived of it. We've been distributing since ages. Will you teach us now? Go that side! Why do you interfere? Come here. Sir, like the child told us, five people did not get any sweet dumpling. And eight people are deprived of 'Peas Sundal'. This is surprising. A small boy analysed and calculated the Math so easily. All by the grace of God. Child! What did you say? I'm the indestructible one. How dare you claim that your Lord Hari is omnipresent? If He is omnipresent, why is He not in this pillar? [Laughs] "Lord, the time has come" Let Him show Himself to King Hiranyakashipu! "Lord, the time has come" - Prahlad! Is your Hari in this pillar? Yes, father. He is! Is Hari in this pillar? Yes, father, He is! Is He in this pillar? - Yes, father. He is! Let's see then! [Screaming] Ramanuja! Ramanuja! Look here... What happened, son? - I was frightened. - Oh! Ramanuja, do you see that? God Namakeertha, our ancestral deity. Fold your hands and pray. [Vocal Music] Now, sing. Professor Sitaraman saw me at some temple. He says, I have enough money. And that I visit all temples in Kumbakonam to stalk young girls. If he is an old man who has no money, what can I do? He should only focus on teaching Mathematics, but he repeatedly asks me questions in class and insults me. I just don't understand Math. What can I do? Ramasamy, tell me something. That old man says, only those who are good at Math can woo girls. Is there a rule as such? - Ramanujan is here. Come in, Ramanuja. Mom asked me to get the rent. Here. May I take this book? I'll read and return it tomorrow itself? [Laughs] School children will not understand this. It's Trignometry. We don't understand a thing although we're BA students. That's okay, let me just go through it. Then, I'll return. Ramanuja, there are no pictures or dolls in the book. You are the only child who is keenly asking for a Math book. Okay, you may take it. [Vocal Music] Komalam... Here you go. After deduction of Rs 2 I had taken advance last month, [Coins clinking] here's the balance of Rs 18 that my boss gave. I'm trying all that I can. I give music tuitions to kids. I sing at the temple. I have given a room on rent to two college students. But still, it is so difficult to run the household every month. What can we do? This is all I can manage. Narayana... Ramanuja, did you finish going through the book you borrowed yesterday? I have finished studying it, uncle. What?! You finished studying? Is he making fun of us?! You say, you've gone through the entire book. Let me give you a sum. Can you solve it? Sure, uncle. Find the area of a quadrilateral in a circle. [Laughs] What's this? He is solving it just the way it's illustrated here. Show it to me. A sum that's two pages long, he solved it in just four steps! 'Salutations to you, O great Mother who reside in Chakra,' 'Conch shell and Mace, I worship Thee, Goddess Mahalakshmi.' 'You in Your ferocious form slayed the demon Kola,' 'I worship Thee...' - Aunt, is Ramanujan in? He hasn't returned from school. What's the matter? - Well, aunt... All these are our classmates. All of us have come to Ramanujan for a private tuition in Math. Is it? I'm so happy. All of you can wait upstairs. Ramanujan will be back soon. Okay, come. - Please come. Ramanuja, this slate on which you've solved a problem, I showed it to our professor, Mr. Sitaraman. He was speechless for the next five minutes. And then, with no energy at all in his voice, [Sighs] he sighed and asked me, who solved this in such a simple method and in which college was he teaching. I replied, 'The great one studies in grade three' 'in the Town School.' That is all. He was shocked. I wonder what happened to the old man after that. Only after we go to college tomorrow will we know if he is still alive. Did you hear that? Students pursuing bachelors have come to learn Math from Ramanujan. Do all of you now understand how easy is Trignometry? Yes, we do. Everyone can be a master if someone teaches Math in this method. Ramanujan is great! But his is a very poor family. We must do something to help him. - Definitely! [Coins clinking] Now that we are expert in Math, we have the license to stalk beautiful girls in Kumbakonam. [Laughs] What's this, Mr. Subba Iyer? I asked you to prepare time-table and you've made such blunder. You haven't allotted English for some sections. Some don't have a Biology lecture. I cannot rectify these. - You may ask my wife. I've been struggling so hard, with no sleep and food for two weeks to prepare this time-table. I still made a mistake. I am an ordinary school teacher. Only a college professor can prepare this perfectly. Where will I find a professor now? Stay up for two more weeks and prepare a correct time-table. Please go. Ramanujan, where are you going? - I'm going to my class. Sir, give me a minute. Ramanujan, come with me. - Sir? - Nothing to worry. Come with me. - Where are you taking me to? To the headmaster's room. - I haven't made any mistake, sir. Are you happy with just being a Math expert in Kumbakonam? Please help me with our school time-table. How many sections are there in all? Grade One, we have A, B, C, D. Second grade has A, B, C. Grade 3 has A, B, C, D. Fourth grade has A, B, C, D and E. Grade 5th has A to F. That means, there are 22 divisions in all. - That's right. How many teachers do we have? - 36 teachers. Which teacher is for which subject, you'll get those details here. Please sit and work on it. Sir, give me a time-table sheet. - Okay. Here you go, sir. Not a single mistake. Brilliant! There was one lotus in a pond. The specialty is, it doubles the very next day. In fifteen days, half the pond was filled with lotuses. In how many days will the entire pond be filled with lotuses? What a silly question! If it took 15 days for the pond to be half filled, it is obvious it will take another 15 days for the rest to fill. Is this what you call Mathematics? If half the pond is filled with flowers, it will take only one day for the entire pond to be filled. Very good, my son. Did you hear that? Your son is correct. Okay. - "Singing the hymns of the great..." Eight, seven, six, five... Four... Ramanuja, come here. [Coughs] Come here. Come, do some physical exercises. It's good for health. Your friends are exercising here. Sir, I'm always exercising. But with numbers and not using my body. I'm happy with that, sir. Two, three... Lakshmi, Ramanujan played so well when he was your age. Why are you hesitating? Come on, make your move. Place it. There he goes. But it's a check and mate. You should've been more careful. Mom, I have topped in school in the Matriculation exam. Oh, wow! - Bless me. - I'm so happy. Stay happy. - God bless you. - You're a gifted child. Goddess Namagiri in the form of my mother had made a prophesy. That the Goddess will reside in your tongue always. Ramanuja, you must go to college and acquire a BA degree and be a successful officer. Then, put an end to our sufferings. Will he do that? - Of course, my child will. When I behold upon the night's starred face, huge cloudy symbols of a high romance and think that I may never live to trace their shadows, with the magic hand of chance never have relished in the fairy power of unreflecting love... Then on the shore of the wide world, I stand alone and think till love and fame to nothingness do sink. This poem of Keats is about the mortality and his fear of death. He is anxious that he will not achieve fame for his work before he dies. What are you doing? Is it English class or Mathematics class? He practices Math in all the lectures, sir. Sir, please don't shout at him. I asked him to help me with this. It's my mistake, sir. Both of you, get out of this class. Wait. Ramanuja, the students sitting behind us were playing with puppets that they tied on your shirt. Hence, we got caught by the professor. I really love puppet shows. But I loved the Mathematics book by Carr more. And so, I didn't know they played. Anandu, why did you take the blame for my mistake and come out? That's because, I like Ramanujan so much. Ramanuja, what are you doing? I'm researching on Bernoulli numbers. Bravo! Very good! When a Fine Arts student researches in Higher Math to this level, I really feel so proud, being a Math professor. But if you have to pass in your scholarship exam, Math alone will not help. English, Roman History, Physiology, you must study all the other subjects. And you have only one week for it. So, do what you can. [Sobbing] Hey, I hear someone crying. Ramanuja, what's wrong? Why are you crying? I failed the Junior Subramaniam Scholarship exam, mom. I scored 100 out of 100, in Math. But in English, I failed by 3 marks. They denied scholarship to me. - Is that all? Why are you crying so bitterly for that? I'll come and speak with your Principal tomorrow. How could he deny my son, a scholarship? You don't worry, my son. You shouldn't cry for this silly reason. I agree, Mrs. Komalam. That Ramanujan is extremely talented in Mathematics. But I had made it clear to him that he has to fare well in all subjects. He didn't listen to me. He made a mistake once. Please explain to him. - I'll try. Since he scored the highest marks in every subject in school, we expected him to be a bright student and that he'd successfully complete ICS. That's the reason we got him enrolled in this college. He is so crazy and obsessed with Mathematics. How can we help, madam? Madam, he will have to study all the subjects well while in college. He is a genius in one subject. If he is a zero in all the other subjects, it means, he doesn't deserve to be in college. Rather than being a master of one, we'll be happy if he is average in all the subjects. We cannot give him a scholarship for the only reason that he is talented in Maths. Ramanuja... What's wrong with you? Why didn't you come to college today? Your mom has managed to pay the college fees. So then what's the problem? What are you doing here? I left for college from home, in the morning. I suddenly remembered a problem I left incomplete last night. I came to the temple thinking I'd finish it here. And I dozed off. But I was solving the math problem even in my sleep. All of a sudden, I saw someone in the form of a flame. It wrote the answer on my tongue and disappeared. I am sure, it was Goddess Namagiri. I... I have absolutely no doubt. The solution she wrote on my tongue... I have written it down here. Here, this is the solution. Take a look Anandu. What I'm speaking is the truth. Everyone here is an impostor. Although they are grown ups, they have a narrow mind. You are someone who drove your mother out of your house. Tell me from the bottom of your heart, are you a good man? Are you? How does he know our family affairs? Is he really mad? He is not insane... Beat him and he'll come... - No! Stop it! - Don't hit me. Stop it! - Beat him up! - He is suffering already. Why are you beating him up? He has lost his mental balance and doesn't remain quiet. That is why, his wife and children left him. Please go, everyone. Dismiss! They hit me! - Master, why did you fight with them? I don't like this world and the people living here. So, I have created my own little world where I travel alone. Why do they have a problem with that as well?- Okay. They hit me if I say something. They don't even feed me. I'm so hungry, Ramanujan. Here, I have some rice. Come, eat. - Give... Come, sit here. Have it. Please eat. Have it. There is no hurry. - Ramanujan... People in my world are tiny. But they have a big heart. They come running for help, on seeing someone in trouble. These people find happiness in others' sufferings. - Okay. Why do these people get angry if I speak the truth? It's okay, you have the meal. I am done. You eat the rest. Are you done? At least, you understood me. You are a very good man. You're a good man, Ramanujan. Poor PT Master! He was a healthy man. Now, he has turned insane. Anandu, he isn't insane. He couldn't bear the sufferings inflicted by the real world. So, he has created a world of his own where he lives. He is so fortunate for that. I wish to be in my own world of math always. But I cannot. I cannot do so. What's this? [Ramanujan crying] Ramanuja... - I failed in the FA exam, mom. How will I face the society, mom? Your son is absolutely useless. You have spoiled him, by pampering him all the time. What use is it, if he scores full marks in Math and fails in other subjects? Does it make any difference if a well is filled with water or half full? You will anyway drown. He ruined all my desires. [Sobbing] What is the use of crying now? Go and die! [Coins clinking] [Train horn blares] Do you have any news? Komala, I visited all our relatives. He did not go to anyone. They have no news of him either. [Sobbing] I scolded him as I was concerned for him. I should not have done that. For that reason, why did he leave the house... I wonder where he went. Poor boy! Ramanuja... - God! What are you doing so seriously at midnight? I'm analysing partition numbers. Partition numbers?! What are those? I'm finding in how many ways can one number be written. For instance, the number one can be written as only 1. 2 can be written in two ways, 2 and 1 + 1. 3 can be partitioned in 3 ways, 3, 2+1 and 1+1+1. That's interesting. Each number can be written in different ways and I can go on. 5 can be written in 7 ways, 6 in 11 ways. 7 in 15 ways. 15 in 176 ways. 176 can be written... Can you tell me in how many ways can you write 176? No. How would I know that? Just take a wild guess and tell me a number. If you say 15 can be written in 176 different ways, 176 can be logically written in 1000 probable ways. No, sir. 176 can be written in 4,76,71,58,57,290 ways. Oh my Goodness! You're a genius in Math. You are a genius. - Genius?! But this genius is unwanted by the college, by my dad and even my village. - Which place are you from, sir? Kumbakonam. - Where are you heading to? I don't know exactly. I heard there is someone in Vishakapatnam who helps people good in Mathematics. I'm heading there. Is it? All the best, sir. The village chief has gone to Kashi with some people. Would Ramanujan have gone with them too? Madam Komalam, I have inquired about it. Ramanujan did not go with them. I've also sent a message to all the police station in Madras limits. They will soon find him. You please don't worry. Look at this. Hindu Paper! Ramanujan's missing report is filed here. Don't worry. He will surely return. Hey, Komala... Come in. - [Prayer bell ringing] Is Ramanujan back? I'm so happy. Iyer kept telling me, he'd surely come back. Why are you standing? Please take a seat. He is offering prayers. He'll be right here. Peace... Hey, Ramanuja! So, you're back! I heard, someone in Vishakapatnam offered financial help to talented people in Math. So, I went there. I did not find even a bird or animal that knows mathematics. [Laughs] [Sanskrit verse] You're so right. - What do you mean, Ramanuja? Aunt, sins committed in any place can be washed away in Kashi. The sins committed in such a holy place Kashi is washed out here. On realising Kumbakonam is far way better, I came back. [Laughs] He has such a good humor sense. Ramanuja, I realise how embarrassing it will be for you to study FA in Kumbakonam. You don't worry. I know someone in Pachaiyappa's college in Madras. I'll get you enrolled there. Sir... - Come, Ramanujan. Want to share? I just had my lunch, sir. - What did you have? Curd rice and pickle. [Chuckles] Ramanujan, for the brain storming you do, curd rice won't suffice. You start drinking two raw eggs, every morning. You will do fine. - [Gasps] Good Lord! I fail in physiology because I don't understand it, being a vegetarian. How can I eat eggs? If I do that, God will prick my eyes is what mom told me as a child. Okay. You stick to your customs. I called you for a reason. In this issue's mathematical journal, there is a problem. I gave it a try, but couldn't solve it. So, I called you. See if you can solve it. Sit. I'll wash my hands and be back. Sir... - Yes? I solved this when I was in Kumbakonam. I've written it here. Ramanujan, you're a real genius. But I wonder if there is anyone as talented as you in our country, who would understand your level of mathematics. A math problem you solved... I showed it to Krishnan college professor, Edward Ross. He asked me if you knew Pollish language. When I said no, he immediately told me that a mathematician in Polland had solved a similar math, last week. Ramanujan, you should've been born elsewhere. I'm really proud of you. [Crane squawking] What are you seeing there? Sir, those cranes are sitting at a distance, when in the pond. But when they fly in the sky, they fly in a line at equi-distance as if it's planned. I am just thinking how is that even possible. What are you talking? I didn't get you. When the cranes fly on the sky in a 'V' shape, between the two lines, form about 130 to 140 degrees. Only if they fly in that angle will the first crane will be able to give place to the other crane after crossing a certain distance. Ramanujan, your geometry knowledge is just amazing. Lakshmi, did you perform the pre-meal ritual? Mash well. - Komala... He went to Madras telling that he was studying for FA, intermediate. He returned mid-way as he fell sick. He has been studying FA for the past three years. And he continues to. But he did not pass. Don't talk aloud. - You stay quiet. It's all because of his obsession in Math. I wished that he acquires a degree. His colleagues have finished graduation and are at good posts. Despite all that has happened, he isn't quitting his math. - Speak soft. If he happens to hear that, he might get angry and run away again. You're worried that he isn't responsible enough, right? You don't worry. I have found a way to make him responsible. His dad is not at all keen in getting him married. He said, he wouldn't attend the wedding. Do you know that? Yes, I know. Komala is very stubborn. We already know she does what she has decided. - Yes, we know. Look at her, she is least bothered that her husband did not come. The boy is a mama's boy. He never crosses the line drawn by his mom. [Chanting mantras] Janaki, I am not at all in a state to get married. Mathematics is my world. I failed in FA thrice. I was so scared of my future and mom got me married. I was struggling alone. To add to the misery, she brought you into my life. - Don't worry. What do you mean? Your mom told me, I should entice you so much to drive away that cunning Math from your life. I will rid you of it. You don't worry. [Laughs] Hello. Narsimha... - Yes, sir? Did you send money home like I told you to? - I did, in the morning. Who is he? He has come asking for a job. Looks like, he is very intelligent. He topped his school in matriculation. We need an accountant and so, I asked him to stay. Come here. What is that? - My certificates. That's alright. Maintain the accounts properly. There should be no mistake. I will pay you Rs 18 per month. I will give you a hike after I review your performance. You can join today. Narsimha, explain all the details to him. - Okay, sir. Manager, he said he'd give me a higher salary if my math is good. These math problems are mine. Should I show these to him? Of course, you must. Go and show it to him. Sir, these are the math done by me. Your maths? Let me see. What is all this? Your math equations make my head spin. Our company account is very simple. We use only numbers in it. You have also written and used alphabets in Mathematics. If I hire you, my company accounts will become confusing. You cannot do this. You may leave. [Indistinct chatter] [Sobbing] Have some coffee. You aren't the same old guy anymore. You are a family man. You shouldn't cry for every trivial thing. Be brave. Okay? Strange! You have the blessings of Goddess Saraswati. But ordinary people will not understand all that. You're talented enough to research on Higher Mathematics. But these people want ordinary clerks who will add and subtract. Get this clear. You need not beg in front of people who do not know to respect you. So then, who will put an end to our miseries? Will they put an end to it? Will these brainless twerps do it? For the knowledge you have, everyone in our country should celebrate and honor you. But even our educational institutions couldn't do that. How will these people acknowledge you? You don't worry. In Madras, people interested in Math have started a Mathematical society. Well known, successful people from higher authorities are members. I will write down a recommendation letter to each one of them. You go and meet them. Leave the rest to God. Okay? Radhakrishna, do you see my state? Nobody in Kumbakonam valued my talent and hired me. In Madras, the people I meet are admiring my talent in Math highly. But they have no job to offer me. I understand one thing clearly. Radhakrishna... My mathematical skills is wasting my life. Ramanuja, are you unwell? Should we see a doctor? No, that's not required. I underwent an operation back in my town. If I wander for a while, I feel exhausted. That's all. I am really worried about you. Galileo died following a trial for contempt of religious beliefs. I will die of hunger. - Don't be so stressed. Radhakrishna, will you do me a favor? If I die, will you send my notebooks to Prof Singaravelu Mudaliyar or Christian College Prof. Edward Ross? Will you do that? - Ramanuja, why do you say such things? You shouldn't give up. How many people are left to meet? Tell me that. He is the only one left. Vivan Bahadur Ramachandra Rao, ICS District Collector, Nellur. Oh, him? His brother-in-law Krishna Rao is known to me. I'll send him along with you to Nellur. Have faith. Brother-in-law, he is Srinivasa Ramanujan. Sir, I have done an extensive research on continued fractions. For instance, any complete number can be summoned as an infinite continuation. Here, this way... Similarly, I have made a lot of research on partition numbers. For instance... - I have lot of work. I'll check these later. You may leave now. Do you have brains? So what if you are my relative? How could you bring a roadside beggar calling him as a genius? Look at his face! He looks like a fraud. Is he a genius? Take these and leave. - No, brother-in-law... Many renowned people have appreciated him. Sesha Iyer and Ramasamy Iyer have recommended him. You may take two days, but please take a look at these books. We'll wait for your answer. I meet so many people. I can judge a person by his looks. Don't waste my time. Just leave. One plus two plus three plus four plus five plus etcetera... Is equal to -1/12. This... How can the sum of whole numbers be negative? The project we have taken should be finished on time. I want no excuses. Mr. Ramanujan... Let's meet later. - Yes, sir. Please come. I checked your notebooks yesterday. Initially, I did not understand anything. It was so confusing. Later, I analysed them carefully. I realised your Math isn't the ordinary math we know. To realise that, it took me an entire night. You are an original mathematician who is extremely talented. Sorry, for whatever happened yesterday. Please forgive me. What do you want? Tell me. I want freedom, sir. I want to be free of my struggle for a meal. If I get that, I will continue to research on Math and travel in my dream world. To put an end to your starvation, I'll pay you Rs 25 per month, from my personal account. Along with that, I will also get you a decent job in Madras. But you shouldn't stop your researches on Mathematics. Don't stop dreaming either. Okay? Yes? Yes, this is Sir Francis Spring. What?! I told you to finish it yesterday. I don't want any excuses. Get it done. Please sit down. You joined as a clerk here. I think your problems have come to an end to some extent. Collector Rao not only recommended you for this job, but since you are a talented Mathematician, he has asked me to take good care of you. I have brought my mom and wife to Madras. The work here is simple. I finish everything in half an hour. I get time for my math research in the free time. What is all this? What is this? You have written all over the paper, in different colors. Sir, well... I need rolls of paper to try solving my math problems. Where will I find so much paper from? So, I first write down using a pencil. And then, I write across it using permanent ink. [Chuckles] Ramanujan, your math is high level mathematics. You are God gifted. God gifted? Look at this, sir. - What's this? Why is the back of your hand dark? I used to write sums on a slate when I was a child. And I used to rub it off using the back of my hand. That is why, it's turned dark. My hand turned dark, to make me an intelligent man. [Anklets tinkling] Did you have too much of work today? Yes, mom. So then, take off your coat and sit comfortably. No, mom. Victoria Hostel students will be here for a tuition now. What's this, Ramanuja? You've returned so tired. Will you also take tuitions? I refused to accept the money collector Rao gave me. I earn Rs 30 as a salary at the Port Trust. How can I run a family in Madras with this little money? While in Kumbakonam, you taught Math to BA students. Here, you teach MA students. Your passion to teach Mathematics will never leave you. How can I change that? [Sighs] Please come. Have a seat. [Sobbing] Janu, why are you crying? Since morning, I've been waiting for him. As soon as he came back from office, did he speak a word with me? He is busy talking in volumes with those strangers. When I think of that, tears roll down my cheeks. I have a doubt here. [Chuckles] This is a doubt I asked my Math teacher when I was in school. He avoided it too. I later found out, the answer to it is infinity. That is, zero by zero is equal to one, two, hundred, thousand, ten thousand... It can go up to infinity. Do you know something? Before mathematicians found this, it was stated in Upanishad. In Upanishad, a Guru looked at his disciple and said, 'There's a fig under that tree. Bring it here.' Student says, 'Here, I've brought it, sir.' Teacher, 'Break the fruit'. 'I have broken it', says the student. 'What is inside it?' 'There are tiny seeds.' 'Take one seed and break it.' 'I have broken it.' 'What do you see inside it?' 'Nothing at all, sir. It's empty.' 'Student, understand this.' 'It is from that zero that such a huge tree grows.' Similarly, from a zero, one, two, three, ten, hundred, ten thousand and all numbers with a value can be created. That is why, zero is called an infinite number. It's as good as God. The symbol of the absolute. Aunt, could you please give me some water to drink? What's your name? - Narsimhachari. Ramanujan is not a bachelor anymore. After marriage, it is now that his wife has come to live with him. If you all keep discussing math all day, he won't get to spend some time with his wife. I understand, aunt. I'll leave. I can narrate you many such stories from Vedic philosophy for every math equations. Ramanuja, let's call it a day. We'll take your leave now. I've only narrated a story from the Upanishad. I haven't started the main lesson as yet. - That is what I have to say. You go and start with your main lesson. We'll leave. What did they say? I didn't understand. I kept wandering for a job. I was so afraid that I may not be able to bring you and start a life together, because of being jobless. You have brought me now. I thought, Math is the only beauty in this world. My wife Janaki is as beautiful too. Why did you run out? What's the matter? Mother told me, Goddess Namagiri come in your dreams at midnight and tell you amusing math tricks. You then wake up and look for a slate to jot down the math. After we sleep tonight, if you have a similar dream and you go looking outside to find a slate, what will mother think? That is why, I brought this here. On our wedding night, you called math as a third wheel in your life. You told me you'd entice me so much that you'd drive away cunning math out of my life. And now, you've kept the slate I write math on, next to me. After knowing that Math is the reason behind my husband's fame and growth, how could I be angry at it? - So, like you mentioned earlier, won't you try and entice me? I wish to do that, but looks like I will be enticed by you. Ramanuja, what are you doing here? What's all this? I am collecting waste paper. I can use it to write down my math problems. Why are you collecting waste paper from this place? What will people think about you? You want paper to write math, is that all? - Yes. I'll give it to you, come. Dear God! On this desk, I'd kept two papers on which I'd written in red ink and pencil. You saw that? - I didn't, Ramanujan. I did keep it here. Mr. Iyer. Sir, did you call me? What's this? You wrote personal accounts on this official file. Well, I'm sorry. It wasn't me. It was Ramanujan, who did this by mistake. Who the bloody hell is Ramanujan? - He's a clerk in the record section. Which one of you is Ramanujan? It's me, sir. What are you doing in this section? I do analysis in the record section and write them down, sir. What are these? Are these related to office work? No sir. These are my theorems. What are these? My research note book. While you come to the office, didn't you know that you cannot bring your own things? Sorry, sir. I didn't know that. Why do you think we pay you? To do your personal work in this office? I will not have this impertinent behavior going on here. Do I make myself clear? Can't you handle this? Why do you need to tell everything? What's wrong with you? Do you run a fever? Oh no. God, will you not let me live peacefully? Ramanujan... What happened to him, Janaki? He's like this since he came from office. What happened in the office, Ramanujan? The chairman came to me and caught me red handed doing Maths. He grabbed all my notes and said he didn't hire me to do my personal work. Didn't Narayanan Iyer support you? Don't be foolish, mom. The God is angry at me. What can Sarangapani Bhattar do? Don't worry about anything. Come with me. Pray to God. Worship Goddess Namagiri. Everything will be okay. Dear Goddess, I shouldn't lose my job. I shouldn't roam in the streets again. [Knocking] Come in. Ramanujan. You cannot work in the record section anymore. My whole family is dependent on this job, sir. I will not do any other work, except office work. Please, sir. Forgive me, once. [Laughs] My dear fellow, I said you don't have to work in the record section. I didn't say you cannot work in this office. Take your seat, Mr. Ramanujan. Please sit down. Yes. I went through your notebooks and you are a rather incredible mathematical wizard. Amazing. It's a shame to keep a genius like you, in the records section. [Call bell dings] Mr. Iyer. - Sir. Give him a separate room. From now, you shouldn't do any official work. You should only do Mathematical research. No one can understand your level of mathematics here. So, you send your discoveries to professors in London. For your research, I'll get the support from Madras university. Thank you very much, sir. What a fellow! You need to live a long time, I surrender to you God Manivannan. - [Anklets tinkling] Janu! - Yes? What's the matter, mother? - Please come here. Ramanujan is working on his research. If you go there, you will disturb him. Give them to me. I'll take care of them. You go and take rest. - No, mother. He said, he's able to do his research better when I'm besides him. Is that so? - Yes. Ramanujan was known as 'Tiger' in Kumbakonam. Were you by his side then? Go and take rest, now. Why didn't Janaki come? She's an adolescent, Ramanujan. She's getting tired, very soon. Poor girl. You continue with your research. [Sobbing] Ramanujan, please sit down. The chairman has given you a separate room and you are just working on your research. Did you write any letters to London? - Yes, sir. We have a reply. Professor Hobson is very busy. He has sent your letter back without opening it. Who is that? Professor Baker, he too hasn't opened your letter but he sent you back your letter in a different envelope. These British professors are cold hearted. [Sobbing] Ramanujan, you shouldn't worry about such things. These British people are very formal. They wouldn't see anything that doesn't interest them. Don't stop your research and effort. There are many professors in London. You have written about so many things. Send those to everyone. Don't lose your heart and self esteem. [Bell dings] Yes, sir. Yes, call Mr. Littlewood. [Knocking] Littlewood, at last there you are. I'm sorry. Did I spoil your delighted evening? We were going to a dance program. It's alright. You must have called me with a purpose. Ladies, no dance program today. Thank you. Of course, until tomorrow then. Tell me. I got a letter today. An Indian clerk who finished his school final year has said that he discovered 50 math theorems and sent them to me. Do I have to spoil my wonderful evening for an Indian fool, who sent you this letter? Ladies, please do come back. I'll join you after all. Littlewood, wait. At first, I thought of him as a fool. But after looking at his theorems, I think he's a genius. So, I thought of examining those theorems together. Well, ladies, I'm afraid, there's a need, for me to be here. Let's meet tomorrow. Well then, Hardy, show me these theorems, written by the Indian clerk. Here they are. Wild. Absolutely all over the place. He's definitely a mathematician of higher class. Looking at these theorems, He could be the 2nd Isaac Newton. Come on! That's well played. - Wow. Littlewood. - Hardy. Do you know her? - Yes. Littlewood. - Yes. I got a reply from Ramanujan. For an Indian Mathematician, he's struggling to make his ends meet. That's dreadful. Brain can't work when the stomach is empty. Is it difficult to be a mathematician in India? But in England, it's a heaven for all mathematicians. Like Hardy, a chronic bachelor, without any responsibilities, he can play cricket as well. or like Littlewood, who enjoys being with different girls, everyday. He can enjoy his life too. Littlewood... Why can't we arrange for Ramanujan to come to London and do his research? Good idea. "Being in love, full of excitement," "the lord is happy." "Bowing my head and seeking knowledge." "I surrender to you, lord." "I surrender to you, lord." Why are you here, Ramanujan? I got a letter from London. I wanted to get God's blessings before opening it. What's in the letter? I wrote about all our problems to Professor Hardy. He has invited me to come to London and continue my research. He has arranged for everything in London. [Sobbing] Mother. Mother. Mom. Why are you crying? - You are my only son and you are weak as well. Foreign country would not be suitable for you, son. Moreover, a very important reason, according to our holy scriptures, it's not good to go to a foreign country. These are written in our holy scriptures. Our relatives would abandon us. Mom, if it's written in the holy scriptures, I better not go to London. Professor Hardy has congratulated me and wrote to the Indian government. We will get benefits from that. That's enough for me, mom. What will happen to our standards, if we take someone as a research student, who has failed the intermediate level 3 times? We shouldn't select him. Please remain calm. It was not us who discovered Ramanujan is a genius. It was Cambridge Professor, G. H. Hardy, Director General of Observatories, Sir Gilbert Baker FRS, Professor Griffith, Professor Mas, Port Trust Chairman Sir Francis Spring, they all have certified about the genius mind of Ramanujan. The government has recommended him. Now tell me, shall we come to a resolution about Ramanujan? If Cambridge Professor has certified then it's a good decision. A humble request to the Vice Chancellor, please don't record our opposition to this resolution. Please write as it was an unanimous decision. It'll be very helpful, please. The resolution has passed. Mr. Prashanta Chandra Mahalanouis, you are a student from India. Studying at King's college, Cambridge You tell us, does your religion, doesn't allow people to go abroad? Is that true? - Yes, that's true, professor. If we go abroad, then they believe that we lose everything. In India, we can live, without anything, but we cannot live without religion. This is ridiculous, religion and all sorts of daft things. Hardy, don't be so callous. We are agnostics. What do we know about traditional Hindu religious beliefs? Let them have their own beliefs. Mr. Nouis, how did you manage to come to this country and study? I do come from a traditional Hindu family, our beliefs are totally different. If we commit a mistake then we seek out the remedies to correct our mistakes. We just have to do the remedial measures properly. That's all. Then we have a way to bring, Ramanujan to Cambridge. Janaki, I feel very sorry for you. I'm unable to take you out and show Madras, like other people. I'm unable to discuss my research with you, as well. Since you are an adolescent, I'm unable to tell my problems to you. I'm not an adolescent girl. Your mom used to say, once the nuptial chain have been worn and one night is complete, after that, every girl is an adult. You can tell me about any of your problems. I'll sort them. [Laughs] Okay, I'll tell you. Mom says, I should not go abroad, against our beliefs. I agree with that. Hardy says, I can become a genius only if I come to London. That seems very reasonable to me. Hardy has sent someone to convince me to come to London. He's coming here to meet me. I'm wondering what to tell him. That's my problem. That's not a real problem at all. Goddess Namagiri comes in your dreams, right? Ask Her if you can go to London or not. Then your mom's wishes are not a big deal. If we get the permission from God, why do we need Sarangapani priest's permission? [Laughs] Good morning, sir. Welcome, sir. Welcome, madam. These people are sent by Mr. Hardy. He's Mr. Nevil. Hello. She is Mrs. Nevil. Please, sit down. - Yes. Look at the guts of these Britishers. She held another woman's husband's hand and shook for such a long time. Shameless people! Why can't she be like us, Indian women? That's their culture. - They don't have a culture. After they leave, ward the evil eyes off Ramanujan, okay? Mr. Ramanujan, I truly believe that Cambridge is the best place for you. Please accept Prof. Hardy's invitation and go to London. All of us wish for the same. If you come to London and do your research, you will definitely earn fame and success. We are ready to accept any of your conditions. Do I have to write an exam after I come to London? Why are you asking that? Because I'll definitely fail the exam. [Laughs] My dear fellow, no, you won't. Do you have any other conditions? I need Mother Namagiri's permission to come to London. Is that all? We will speak to your mother right away and get her approval. Please sit down. Namagiri is not Ramanujan's mom. She's a Goddess in Nammakal. It's a deity. Mr. Iyer, is this possible? Sir, I truly believe in God. I don't know how to answer this question. Go to Namakkal with Ramanujan and obtain clearance. This is an important official duty for you. Dear Goddess, please tell me if I can go to London or not. I need your approval. It's a good sign, the Goddess has given permission by giving this flower to you. It is in your favor. Thank you, priest. - Go ahead. Ramanujan, our Goddess has blessed you. Shall we leave now? This is not enough, sir. The Goddess should come in front of me and give her approval. Until then, I'm going to stay here. Is that so? Okay. Ramanujan... It's been two days since we are here. I spoke to Bhattacharya. Nobody has come here and stayed so many days to seek Her approval. But he said if we need a reply soon, there's a woman there who is possessed. He says, we can get a reply from God through her. He says, the Goddess's approval is conveyed through her. The Goddess has not come to me directly to give Her approval. I think, the Goddess doesn't like me going to London. We can stay as many days here, get the Goddess's approval and then meet the Chairman with a good news. That's more important. Sir. - Yes. It's me. I've been noticing that you have been staying here for 3 days, without any sleep. Who are you and why are you here? We are here on official duty. We need the Goddess's approval. - Do you need approval from Goddess? Manager! Sir. - What's going on? I got the approval. - Very good. The Goddess came in my dreams while I was meditating and gave me permission to go to London. I dreamt too when the Goddess came in your dreams. That Ramanujan was living abroad with the British. I'm very happy in sending him abroad. [Sobbing] If you love me, will you go to London alone? Janu, I don't know what to say. How do I explain? Do you think mother won't give me permission to go with you? No, Janu. You don't know how to live there. I'll have to leave you alone when I go to the University. You are so beautiful. The Britishers will whisk you away from me. Will I do my research or will I be at home protecting you? Go and embrace your maths. - No, don't say that. You are getting envy of maths. Okay, be careful and come back soon. I'll write you two letters every month. Are you happy? - Yes. We got the tickets for sea travel. He has to cross many oceans. May God be with you, always. Ramanujan, you have so much hair. Get a nice haircut before you go to London. You need to look smart to the people there. I'm leaving, mom. - Be safe, son. [Scissor rattling] Why did you cut my pony tail? I want to cry bitterly. You shouldn't cry. We bought some suits and shoes for you. Take a shower and change your clothes. Get dressed like a nice English gentleman. - Yes. Excellent! Ladies and Gentlemen, this is Mr. Srinivasa Ramanujan. He has been accepted as a Research Student in Cambridge. [Applause] He'll be leaving for London, very shortly. Hello. - Hello. This is Ramanujan. - Welcome, Mr. Srinivasan Ramanujan. Port Trust Chairman, Mr. Francis has asked to take special care of you. We have arranged for vegetarian food throughout the entire journey. If you have any problems, you can come to my cabin. But only one condition, you shouldn't ask any questions related to mathematics. Because I'm very weak in that subject. Very nice. - [Horn blares] You can come along. Please come. - Ramanujan... Have a safe journey. Don't feel sad. In the mathematics world, I haven't discovered anything so far. But I have discovered the best and I would like to share it with you. And I feel very happy to introduce him to you all. He's Srinivasan Ramanujan from India. [Applause] He didn't have proper guidance while learning Mathematics but performed some miraculous calculations and invented some beautiful formulas. All by himself. He has written about them in these note books. These works of Ramanujan will be enriching the mathematics world, and I firmly believe in that. Learned Professors, I invite you to examine them. Just a minute. Why did you stop eating and what are you doing? I'm a vegetarian. I wasn't sure if there is any meat in this hence, I got these from the kitchen. I need to verify that before I start eating again. Alright, okay. What's going on? - Well... The gentleman here is just checking every bit of food to make sure there's no meat. Is that so? - No meat. No chicken. - Only vegetables. Mr. Vegetable, the one that you just ate, had meat in it. Didn't you know? Really? Dear God... [Laughs] [Puking] They were just making fun of you. It's really a vegetarian item. By the way, I'm B.C. Maranobis. He is Chatterjee. We are from India. All the professors in Cambridge were astonished on seeing Ramanujan's work. Mr. Poliard, you can start researching Ramanujan's theorems. These theorems are very complicated and mystical in nature. Even if I spend the rest of my days, I won't be able to prove even one. Ramanujan, Mr. Poliard is right. Your concepts are very deep. Tell me, why are you writing just the answers? Why aren't you solving step by step to prove them? As soon as I see a problem, the answer comes to me in an instant and I write them, right away. I'm not interested in providing analysis and proving them. Soon, a new problem comes to my mind and disturbs me. I'm interested in solving those new problems. Ramanujan, you should have been born 100 years ago. You are an original Mathematician like Mr. Euler Jacoby. At that time, it was enough, to write just the formulas. But today, we have to provide analysis and to prove the answers. Only then everyone would realize that you are a mathematics genius. Are you doubting my genius capabilities? No. - Not at all. Your genius capability is great. You keep writing new formulas, in your style. Me and Littlewood would research them and prove them to the world and get recognition and fame for you. What are you doing? Oh, you are calculating, the value of PI. I'm going to London. - Okay. You don't need to stop your research for me. Ramanujan, for the first time, I'm going to present your discovery to the London's Mathematical Society. I'll stay with my sister in the evening and will be back tomorrow. Close the door when you leave. It'll lock by itself. - Okay. Hardy, are you back so soon? Did you say 'so soon'? I left more than 30 hours ago. You didn't go to the hostel last night? What did you eat for dinner? I went inside the PI's world. I got involved in the research and forgot about everything. [Door closes] - Forgive me. Ramanujan, let me introduce you to my sister, Miss Getroud Hardy. I couldn't believe myself when my brother told me about you. My brother had other interests like cricket and politics. This is the first time, I met someone who believes in Mathematics alone. Getroud, please don't disturb him. - I'm not disturbing him. Ramanujan, everyone appreciated your discovery that I presented. But there's a small problem. Not a lot of people came from abroad due to the war in Europe. Madam, I wanted to ask you something. Why did Hardy put drapes on all the mirrors? In Kumbakonam, if something bad happens in our house, we cover the pictures of Gods in a similar way. There are no bad things here. My brother, doesn't like seeing himself in the mirror. He thinks that he's the most ugliest person. Hardy, can't you change your attitude after seeing me? [Laughs] My goodness, you are like him too. Mr. Ramanujan, please take good care of your health. The english weather is very bad. No genius is a match for that. Be careful. - Okay. "My dear God, Venkatajalapathi," "You are the one who can, bestow us with knowledge." "I left my home, to a far away land" "The protector of Papanasam" "You are the one who protects everyone" "You are the one who provides us with everything." "Dear God..." "You are present everywhere even in the numbers" "that is the foundation of mathematics." "You manifest in different forms" What's that noise? - Well... Looks like someone is singing. Who's singing at this hour? Let's go and check what's happening. "You are present everywhere, even in the numbers." "That is the foundation of mathematics." "You manifest in different forms" "I surrender to you, my beloved God." My God, man. It's five in the morning. What are you doing? I'm performing puja. - Puja?! I'm singing religious hymns for my God. We mathematicians are all agnostics. How can you sing religious Hyms? An equation without God is worthless, in my opinion. There's no one here to talk to freely. That's why, I'm talking to you. When I see you, I yearn for Janaki. I've written four letters so far. He's talking to a flower. Are you mad at me? Mom is not writing anything about you. Professor, did you see what your beloved student is doing? He's talking to the flowers. It's normal for people like Ramanujan to have different habits. Professor, can I ask you a personal question? Sure. - You are agnostic. You always speak against religion. Ramanujan is not only religious, but he has beliefs that a Goddess writes equations. How are you coping with that? Ramanujan is a genius. From where does he get that genius? I think it comes from, Ramanujan's personality. But Ramanujan believes that it comes from Namagiri Goddess. I can easily argue with him against his beliefs. But what will happen if his mathematical output ends? That's why, I don't like to disturb and speak against his beliefs. Mathematical output is more important to me. Ramanujan, based on your research, on highly composite numbers, they have conferred a BA degree to you. No one has got an achievement like you. [Camera clicks] [Sacred Chants] To my mom and dad, I humbly write to you this letter. Dry them separately. Take them. Don't take them using your left hand! How many times do I have to repeat myself? You all are here. - Yes. Ramanujan has written a letter from London. Really? - Here, read this. Okay, read it aloud. [Sacred Chants] To my mom and dad... Why did you stop reading? He has written mom, dad and his name. How can I say my husband's name? You are too smart. In the beginning, you said the sacred chants that he wrote. Why didn't my son's name bother you then? - Okay, go ahead. To my mom and dad, I humbly write this letter to you. I'm fine and I hope you all are doing fine. For whatever that I had to struggled in India, Hardy made sure that it was all arranged for my comfort. They have conferred a BA degree on me. I have attached a photo along with this letter. He got a degree. Can you please give it to me? Dad was always worried that I didn't get a degree. I hope that I made his dream come true. Since there's a war in Europe, it's difficult to get the things needed to cook Indian food. Please ask Janaki to write a separate letter for me. Look, what he has done. My son is madly in love with his wife. Look at our son. He's looking so smart. Let him be smart. Without you, everyday, is going too slow. You said that you will write two separate letters for me. Why didn't you write even one? Don't you love me now that you're abroad? Do you have a British girlfriend? Father, I had written a letter to my husband. Can you go to the post office and mail it, please? Is this for Ramanujan? I'll definitely mail this letter. Come, my Darling, I'm making all the sweets for Ramanujan alone here. Where were you all this time? - Well... He asked me to send a separate letter. I was writing that letter, gave it to father and just got back. Okay, can you hold this? - Yes. You do this, please. Did she give you a letter for him? - Yes. Can you give that to me? - Hey, Komala. Let her express her feelings for him. Why are you bothered by it? Does my son who's living abroad, need to think about her? There's no need for that. Komala, it was you who forced him into marrying her. That's different and this is different. You won't understand. If she asks about this letter... She would surely ask. Tell her that you mailed it to London. Dear God... Rice crispies, chips and... - Sweets. Yes, sweets. You have to drape all these things tightly and send it to London. Where did I put those drapes? Did I put them on the shelf? Can you bring them for me, please? - Okay. To Janaki. It looks like his hand writing. I'm very sad that you didn't write to me all these days. Did something bad happen to you? Please write to me, soon. I'm always thinking about you. Please write to me, immediately. He had indeed sent me two letters, every month. Mother had deceived me by hiding these letters from me. Dear God, I didn't know about this and was angry at him. I wrote that letter. If my husband loves me, why doesn't my mother like that? Ramanujan. Hardy. - Chaterjee told me that you are sick. How are you feeling now? The pain is persistent. [Groans] Dear God! Pain seems to be severe. Nouis... We need to take him to the hospital immediately. Come on, let's go to the hospital. [Coughs] He is very weak. I think he's not eating nutritious food. What do we have to eat here? If I need to eat properly, my wife needs to come here and cook. Is that possible? - Why can't that be possible? Write a letter to your mom and ask them to send your wife here. If I write that I'm sick and ask them to send my wife Janaki, mom would definitely agree to that. She's never stood against my wishes. Right, left, right, left. Left, left, left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Left, right, left, right, left, right, left, right, left. Cambridge campus became an army camp as soon as the World War started. Hardy. So, have you decided to join the army? You are against wars but majority of Cambridge scholars, including me want to join the army. I'm only worried about Ramanujan's health. I'm worried that he has a serious disease. So, I'm only thinking about getting Ramanujan fame and success. I've recommended him for this year's Trinity Fellowship. If he gets that, he'll get his FRS. Don't you know about Trinity's politics? Your opponents are spreading rumors about Ramanujan's mental state not being stable. There are rules that a person with no mental stability can't win the award. We have to stop these rumours. Because of his extreme hardships in India, Ramanujan has no self confidence. We have to help him in a way where he can live a successful life because of being a genius. [Knocking] Sir. They are calling me. Good luck, Hardy. You too. Can peer Jan get this scholarship? He's not a normal person. It's difficult for him. The rules are against him. It's difficult to get this fellowship. Are you saying that Jan is not a genius? He's a genius but he's acting crazy by talking to plants and flowers. It means that he's mentally unstable. Doctor, have you got the results of Ramanujan? Nurse! - Doctor. Bring me the test results of Mr. Ramanujan. Let's worry about the results later. Please answer me, first. Am I mentally stable? Who said that you aren't mentally stable, Mr. Ramanujan? There's no problem with your mental acumen. Please certify that and give it to me. How can I certify that? I didn't test you for your mental condition. I won't leave if you don't give me the certificate. Please. - Mr. Noubis, what's happening here? Doctor, it's just one certificate. It will mean a lot to him, please. Okay, I'll give you a certificate. Thank you, doctor. I'll keep this in my pocket and walk the streets of this college. If someone tells me I'm crazy, I'll show them this certificate. Chaterjee, please go with him. Doctor. Ramanujan is a genius in mathematics but sometimes he acts abnormal, like now. What about his test results? The results are back. We strongly doubt that your friend has TB. It's better to admit him at the Sanatorium. There are no medicines to cure that disease. There you are! Sit down. I'm afraid that I have some bad news. You didn't get the Trinity Fellowship this time. Don't worry. It's my responsibility to get that fellowship for you. No Ramanujan, it's not because of this. There are some dirty politics at play in Trinity. Since the world war commenced, many people have joined the army. Littlewood has joined too. I'm against wars. I have only a few people by my side. Since there are more people who support this war, my recommendation failed. You don't need to worry. You are involved in maths research. If Janaki comes to London, you will not concentrate on your research. Moreover, you are weak. If Janaki stays with you, you'll be sick. I don't think it's a good idea to send Janaki to London. Please don't think that mom wrote this... [Sobbing] Janaki. [Train horn blares] Why did you stop the train? Some fool is lying on the tracks and wants to commit suicide. Call the police. Hey you, get up. Professor, Ramanujan has been arrested by the police. What? Ramanujan was trying to commit suicide. Thank God he is alright but he was arrested by the police. Darn, fool! We need to help him before the police files a case against him. It's a criminal offense, trying to commit suicide in this country. It will be impossible to get him that fellowship or become a fellow of the royal society, if they register the case. Do you know the address to the police station? - Yes, sir. Let's go. I'm professor Hardy from Trinity College, Cambridge. Why did you arrest him? Do you know who he is? Why should we care about who he is?! He tried to commit suicide on the train tracks. By British law, he's a criminal. We have to file a case against him. - Who did you think he is? He's a world famous mathematician from India. Mr. Srinivasan Ramanujan, FRS. Don't you know if someone receives FRS, you can't arrest or accuse him of anything? What sort of police officers are you? Can it be? Is this the truth? I don't see any exceptions here. Maybe he is really a FRS. Let me check it. We have Srinivasan Ramanujan brought in on charge of attempted suicide claiming to be a Fellow of Royal Society. Is there a provision in the law that states that he can't be charged? Professor, I have a doubt. Is Ramanujan a FRS? No, but I need to save Ramanujan. I'll do anything for that. Sir, that professor, took the prisoner with him. I'll get them back. It's a lie for a FRS to have such a provision. But after making a few calls I got to know that he is a true genius. Why should we spoil his life? Poor fellow. Nurse. - Yes. I'm shivering with cold and I'm unable to do my research. Can you increase the fire in the fire place? I'm sorry. Being in cold air is a part of your treatment. You should never go near the fire place. Who asked you to do this research? I suggest you to take some rest. Lie down. Good night, Mr. Ramanujan. Where are you coming from? Bathroom. It's nice and warm over there. Is that so? Is the bathroom nice and warm? Then I'll go there and continue my research. Who's in there? Come out. - You've been there for an hour. Come out. Move. I'm the doctor. Who's in there? Come out. What's happening here? I was able to solve only one problem. Are you crazy? You are not fit to be a patient here. Enough is enough. Get out! I got you some breakfast. How many times do I have to tell you that I'm a vegetarian. I can't drink this! Why can't you understand that this is a part of your treatment? I don't need your treatment. Oh my God. Doctor! Have you gone crazy? Why are you behaving like this? This is the sixth hospital for you. We can't provide you with your useless village food. You can stay here only if you eat what we provide here or else go to some other hospital. Doctor, can I talk to you for a minute? Doctor, please don't get angry. We'll pacify him. We provide nutritious food. He can't throw it away. Jan, it's getting worse day by day. Why are you being adamant? Nouis, I'm not asking for the homemade soup I make. I'm just asking for rice. They are not cooking it properly and serving me raw rice. Bananas are very cheap. They are not even providing me that. Jan, are you going to starve to death because your home made food isn't available here? Or are you going to eat this nutritious food and feel better? The decision is yours. Janaki... There is water in our well. Where are you fetching this water from? Mother told me, the water from river Kaveri is good for drinking purpose. I'll speak with her. You don't need to take the trouble of fetching water. Do you understand? - Yes. Did you tell Janaki not to get water from river Kaveri? Komala, she is from a well-to-do family. She is not used to such hardwork. Do you really think it is right on your part to make her suffer? That too, when her husband is away from her. - That's enough. I was also a village girl before I became a mother-in-law. Your mother made me work even more. You never uttered a word back then. And now, you're supporting her. I know how I should treat my daughter-in-law. I told you what I had to. If Janaki's father gets to know of this and comes here to take her back home, we can do nothing. I am not scared of all that. Ramanujan... I am here to give you a happy news. Hardy, wasn't the Identities problem a mystery for us? Yes. - I have found a solution for it. Really? Marvellous! Only you can come up with such amusing conclusions. Hardy, you were here to say something. Yes. My discovery has been acknowledged by this world. Srinivasan Ramanujan will now be a Fellow of Royal Society. FRS! [Applause] In the world of Science, in all the existing fields today, there are 464 talented scholars. You are one of them too. This is the highest recognition a Scientist receives across the world. Not just the FRS, you are also now a Trinity Fellow. These are the greatest feat achieved by you as a genius. Congratulations. - Many thanks. Congratulations. Congratulations. Congrats! Congrats. - Congrats. Well done. Oh, no. No. [Crying] Without knowing the hidden talent in me, I wandered around in Indian streets. You are the one who discovered that I had something in me, that the whole world will recognise. You and Little Wood really so genuine. How will I express my gratitude? Here's my ticket to return to India. All the doctors who examined and treated you kept saying, you should take a break and go back to your home town. But since the war was going on, we were too scared to send you. Now that the war has come to an end, it's also time to part ways with you. Everything seems dull today. Including the number of the taxi which I came in. 1729. No, Hardy. 1729 is a very interesting number. It is the smallest number expressible as a sum of two cubes in two different ways. Ram... In this circumstance when you're going to your native, everything that happens should be good. Since you're now an FRS, Madras University accepts you as a professor and it has decided to pay you Rs 400 salary, per month. Also, you're a Trinity Fellow. So, you will be honored with Rs 3750 as an award yearly. You had once written to me from India six years ago that you were struggling for two meals a day. To some extent, I could make you rich enough to afford the basic necessities in life. I'm satisfied. [Coughs] Ramanuja, you went to another country across the ocean. As a remorse for it, I wanted to take you to Rameshwaram. That is why, I came to Mumbai. After seeing your health condition, I dropped that plan too. Hence, I brought you to Madras. Mom, we have reached. Who are you looking for? Who else, but my wife Janaki? Hasn't she come? Why think of her, suddenly? She said, her dad wasn't keeping well, so she has gone to her mother's house. Ramanuja, the successful people in the city have all personally come to the station to receive you. Look! Hindu Paper, Kasturi Iyengar, Ramachandra Rao, Adi Narayan teacher... Go and attend them. Lakshmi, did you hear what your brother said? He wants only his wife. He is least appreciative of his mom who travelled 800 miles for him. You anyway write a letter to Janaki asking her to come. Let's go. - Don't tell him, she left in anger. Okay, mom. - Ramanujan FRS, Long live! Mathematical genius Ramanujan, long live! Math genius Ramanujan, long live! Welcome, Mr. Srinivasa Ramanujan. You've made India proud. You have achieved a big feat, Mr. Ramanujan. Congratulations. The fame you received in Cambridge is a fame for us. We're so proud. Mr. Sitaraman... Mr. Ramanujan, we have arranged a bungalow for your stay. We've made arrangements for you to get all medical facilities there. You will soon recover. Don't worry. [Ramanujan coughing] What has happened to you? Janu, as soon as the train entered Madras Central station, I suffered so much on not finding you there. I was at my mother's house. Nobody informed me of your arrival. Now, as soon as I got a letter, I came running with my brother. Mom still thinks I am a child. Janu, I know everything. Mom never gave you the letters I wrote to you. And she did not send your letters to me... Why talk about it now? I am here already. [Coughs] My chest is aching! You went there for your research so anxiously and you've come back as a patient. What shall I do? Janu... Had you been with me in London, I would not have fallen ill. I wrote a letter to mom asking her to send you to London. And I believed that she'd send you soon. I was counting days like a fool. Yes! Your mom did come to my native one day. On the same day, I wasn't in town. She thought my dad had sent me to London secretly. She started fighting with everyone. Do you still think, she would have sent me to you willingly? You really are a fool. You're a fool too. Newly weds in London express their love openly. They hug each other, kiss... My mom brought me up very strictly. What was wrong with you? You could've been expressive in your letters. Your mom never sent you the letters I wrote. I agree. But you wrote a letter to me after you went to your place. What did you write in that? That I should send you money to buy a gift for your brother's wedding. That is all. Is that how you express your love? You were a fool too. - [Laughs] The two of us are fools. I guess that is why, we came together as a couple. [Both laughs] Janu... Enough of your jokes and happy moments. He is a patient. Leave him alone for some time. [Coughs] - You go and sleep in the next room. Go. Mother, he often suffers a chest pain. If I am here, I could give him hot compress... The nurse or I will do it. We'll take care. You go inside. Take this. - Mom! Freedom fighters are protesting outside for their rights. If you want me to protest or go on a strike to keep my wife with me. I will start right away. Ramanuja! Are you talking like this to your mom? Please don't fight for my sake. I'll obey mother and go, sleep outside. Janu, put it down. You are my wife. I don't have to beg anyone so that you stay with me. [Sobbing] I've been noticing this for quite some days now. You are being really unfair. What mistake did I make? When Ramanujan was abroad, you tortured Janaki and sent her to her house. After so many years, they have got a chance to be together. Let them live happily. Why are you troubling and separating them? Are you out of your mind? Yes, I am out of my mind. I showed Ramanujan's horoscope to an astrologer. He read that and told me, Ramanujan will be famous all over the world, but at the same time, in the peak of his success, he'd die at a very young age. I also showed him Janaki's horoscope. And asked him to find some atonement. He not only said there was none, but also told me Ramanujan will be good if they both stay away. [Sobbing] I want my son to live for many more days. That is the reason I am separating them. Is that wrong? Stop crying. I have grown old. I cannot see things clearly. I, your husband is struggling. But you're worried for your son. I've come from Madras University. There's an order to pay you Rs 3750 yearly. Here it is. Half of the amount is enough for me. I've asked them to distribute the remaining amount to those students who are talented but poor like me. Hand this to Mr. Ravi. - Sure, sir. This is the college where I found 'Pure Mathematics' written by Carr. After that, Mathematics was my only life. Some people called me a genius. While the Principal told me, his college did not need a genius. He only wanted an average student who passed in all subjects. [Ramanujan] Not just in college, Janu... [Ramanujan] Everyone wants average people. If someone turns out to be a genius by mistake, everyone will come together to make him an average person. They'll get him married. They will try imposing household responsibilities on him. If a man is stubborn enough not to live an average life, he will have to wander about like a lunatic. Ramanujan... Ramanujan... Ramanujan... Had I not found someone like Hardy in my life, I would have been wandering on these banks of river Kaveri, like my PT Master. [Coughs] Janu! Janu... What is it? What happened? Here... I have found a new function. I found it. I even gave a name to it. Mock Theta Function! Because I'm sick, everyone thought I can no longer discover new theories. My body is affected, my brain is not. I need to send this to Hardy immediately. Hardy will be extremely happy to see this. He'll be glad, my mathematical output remains unaffected. [Sobbing] Mom... Why are you sad? You have strong faith in horoscopes. I'm destined to live short. As per the lines on my palm, I won't cross a single day beyond 32 years, 5 months. That is all I will live for. - Ramanuja! Please don't say that. Anything you speak comes true. Ramanuja... [Sobbing] Janu... How I wished I could live many more years with you. I cannot. We have no children. The notebooks that I wrote Math in, is like a child to us. Hardy always said, 'the math I arrive at can be discovered only after years of research.' Until the world researches and appreciates me, you should stay alive. This is my wish. [Sobbing] Ramanuja... How is his state? He won't live for one more night. Ramanujan went abroad but couldn't atone for it. If we stay here during his final rites, all of us will be sinners too. You are right. So, what shall we do now? Let us leave this place, even before he breathes his last. They've called me to perform his final rites. After hearing what you said, I think I will have a problem. I'll come with you too. You please don't leave. If we stay here, we'll have to suffer the consequences. Let us go. Please come. Come, let us all leave. Why isn't anyone here? Are the final rites over? Not yet. Ramanujan went abroad but he did not atone for that mistake. So, his relatives left. The priest who came also left with them. I am worried as to how will his final rites be performed. Forget about them. Let them be with their superstitious belief. I visited London too. Did lightening strike me? Ramanujan is a great talent. His final rites should be performed as per customs. What do you say, Chettiarwal? Yes, you are right. Let us perform the rites. There is no shortage of priests in Madras. It is my responsibility to bring a priest to perform his last rites. He was a mathematical genius. None of us understood his math. Won't we be here to even offer him our last prayers? We may be less in numbers. But that doesn't matter. Ramanujan loved all numbers. Numbers were Ramanujan's friends. You make all arrangements. - Sure, uncle.
