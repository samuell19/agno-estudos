TRY STANDING IN ONE PLACE FOR A SINGLE HOUR WITHOUT MOVING. GO AHEAD. I'LL WAIT. HOW'D YOU DO? [ CHUCKLES ] YEAH, NOW TRY FOR THREE MONTHS. AND NOW TRY IT PREGNANT -- PREGNANT WITH SEXTUPLETS. AND THEN REPEAT THAT FIVE TO EIGHT TIMES WITH FOUR-WEEK BREAKS IN BETWEEN TO LIE DOWN AND HAVE YOUR TITS SUCKED RAW. AND, FINALLY, UNLESS YOU GET SICK AND DIE FIRST, YOU CAN GO OFF TO THE SLAUGHTERHOUSE. HERE WE ARE, LIVING THE GOOD LIFE. ENJOY YOURS. HERE, PIG, PIG, PIG, PIG, PIG. COME HERE. IT'S OKAY. YES.

MY FRIEND IS A -- SUCH A NICE, SENSITIVE BOY, BUT THE PROBLEM IS HE IS VERY STILTED IN HIS DEVELOPMENT. -OH. -THAT PUTS HIM IN A REALLY AWKWARD POSITION THROUGHOUT THAT HE'S NEVER SEEN A HUMAN BREAST, UM... OR ANY SKIN OF -- OF THE OPPOSITE SEX. NOW, HE HAS SEEN PLENTY OF BOOBIES ON THE COMPUTER, AND SOME OF HIS FAMILY MEMBERS HAVE LET HIM TOUCH AND JIGGLE SOME OF HIS, UH, BOOBIES, BUT THEY WERE OF THE PLASTIC VARIETY, WHICH MEANS THEY ARE, UH, FAKE BOOBIES. UH, SO HE HAS A REALLY... STUNTED CONCEPTION OF THE FEMALE FORM. UM, AND IF IT WOULDN'T BE ANY -- IF IT WOULDN'T BE TOO MUCH TROUBLE, I WAS WONDERING IF YOU COULD HELP ME OUT BY DOING ME A HUGE FAVOR AND SHOWING HIM ONE OF YOUR BREASTS. -JUST ONE? -I MEAN, WOULD YOU BE AVAILABLE FOR TWO?

THIS IS A SERIOUS PROBLEM! AS OF TODAY, LESS THAN 5,000 PEOPLE HAVE WATCHED THE "KILL YOUR OWN MEAT" VIDEO. THIS TIME LAST WEEK, THE "SPECIESISM" VIDEO HAS ALMOST 90,000 HITS. THAT IS AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE! -PETER, I'M SORRY. -DON'T APOLOGIZE TO ME. APOLOGIZE TO THE 13.5 MILLION COWS LIVING ON FEED LOTS. APOLOGIZE TO THE 63 MILLION PIGS STUCK IN CAFOS. APOLOGIZE TO THE 1.1 BILLION CHICKENS LIVING IN BATTERY CAGES RIGHT NOW. THEY'RE THE ONES WHO DESERVE YOUR APOLOGY. PEOPLE HAVE TO SEE THE VIDEO. IF THEY DON'T SEE IT, THEN THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT. IF THEY DON'T KNOW ABOUT IT, THEY CAN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT. ACTIVISM IS ABOUT ACTION, RIGHT? -WE NEED TO KILL SOMEONE. -OH, WE DEFINITELY NEED TO KILL SOMEONE. -WE WOULDN'T BE THE FIRST GROUP TO TAKE THAT SORT OF ACTION. -UM, WHO -- WHO DO YOU PROPOSE THAT WE KILL? -WELL, YOU KNOW, PIGS ARE AS SMART AS A 3-YEAR-OLD HUMAN BEING. -THEN I DEFINITELY SUPPORT THE KILLING OF 3-YEAR-OLDS. -WHAT?

WE BREAK IN THERE, AND WE SET THEM FREE. -IT'S STRAIGHTFORWARD. IT'S POETIC. I LIKE IT. I LIKE IT A LOT. WHO ARE THESE TWO? [ CAMERA SHUTTER CLICKS ] -THEY HAVE A MINIVAN. -GINGER, IT'S NOT REALLY IN GREAT CONDITION. -I APOLOGIZE. YOU FELLAS WALKED IN AT SORT OF AN AWKWARD MOMENT. THIS ISN'T EXACTLY NORMAL OPERATING PROCEDURE FOR US. BUT THINGS ARE ABOUT TO GET SENSITIVE, SO IF YOU HAVE ANY QUALMS ABOUT ACTING ON YOUR BELIEFS, NOW WOULD BE THE TIME TO LEAVE. -NO. NO QUALMS. -OKAY. LET'S FIGURE THIS OUT. -UH, SO, GINGER, THOSE WERE -- THOSE PEOPLE -- WHAT WERE THEY? SOME OF -- THOSE WERE YOUR FRIENDS? -DO YOU GUYS WANT TO GET WASTED? -YES. -THAT SHOULD BE FUN. -GOOD. ME TOO. FUCK YOUR WIFE FOR KICKING YOU OUT. AND FUCK YOUR DAD FOR CALLING YOU A BASTARD. -HI.
