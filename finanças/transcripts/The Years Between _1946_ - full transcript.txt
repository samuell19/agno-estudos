Yeah, some do some don't You should see my Dad chirpy as cricket You won't see him crying I don't see her crying either That's the trouble, I only wish she would "April 30, 1942. Michael's birthday again, where are you, darling?" Robin,what are you doing? Oh,My Goodness the lamp... And your father's rod I hope you haven't broken that too,have you? No Put it away quickly,before Mummy comes, I do not what she'll say if she knew If Dad is dead,why shouldn't I have his rod? Robin,put that down at once Remember in the future none of your father's things should be touched,do as I say I'll do it I'm awfully sorry,Mummy I... Darling,that's all right but you will take care of Daddy's things in the future,won't you? Oh,Diana,I almost forgot, Mr Llewellyn is waiting outside Oh,good He's going into (?) in the car and wants to know if you'd like to go with him Thank you,Nanny,I don't want to go out,I don't want to see anyone,will you tell him? Very well You never get tired of it,do you? No,I'll play it again for you later on Ames wanted to know today whether we should plant potatoes in the blue border I said no in my view(?) we could grow on one border wouldn't make enough difference to the matters I know how much you love it when it's in bloom Robin has been fishing with Richard twice He's so good with him You would think they were the same age,so they go on Robin wanted to use your rod today I told him you wouldn't like that It looks that they are going to call our Effie Well,then Nanny and I just have to manage just by ourselves It won't be so bad really I can do the beds, and Mrs Ames is coming in to help with the cleaning Oh, darling! It's so good to have you back I began to think you were never coming Days seem so long when you are away I grow so tired of waiting... It's all right now you are here Nanny,what do you want? I thought I heard voices Someone moving about No,there is nobody here but me Hadn't you better go back to bed? Yes,Miss Diana Won't you come up too? -No use,I can't sleep -But you must I can't rest I'll tell you You'll sleep all right if you take one of your tablets,I'll get you one No! Miss Diana... -the box is empty -I know But there were seven or eight on Monday,I happen to notice What of it? But... Nothing Go back to bed Nanny,and leave me alone - Won't you please let me know - Leave me alone! That's just what I mustn't do You know you got to take hold of yourself or you'll be ill -I'm perfectly all right -You are not all right I know it's hard thing to say,but You got to get used to the idea,that the colonel is dead It's no good pretending,all pretending in the world won't bring him back again You got to make up your mind to that and And start a new life,without him -Good bye Nanny -Good bye Robin - You know the Llewellyn's road? - Over the bridge Mr Llewellyn! Hello Nanny Mr Llewellyn,I had to come,you're the only one I can talk to - Is it Mrs Wentworth? - Yes,I'm frightened Frightened? She's going to have a breakdown or worse,if something doesn't happen soon She doesn't eat,she doesn't sleep She told Ames as though he was still alive Mr Llewellyn,she even talks to him Have you had a doctor? Yes,he just told her to rest and relax,you know how doctors are Then what? She's got to have something to do If she had a job,something that took up all her time occupied her mind Then she'd be all right But Nanny that's all very well what sort of a job? I know you'll say I'm crazy, but... I saw that in the paper the other day about an MP who was killed ... and that they elected his wife in his place But Diana doesn't know the first thing about politics Then she'll be in the same boat as half of the other MPs Besides most people still don't like the idea of women in the Parliament That's only because they are frightened that women will get on and do the things they are afraid to do themselves - Where do I come in? - You've got to see that she is nominated - How on earth do I do that? - Sir Ernest Foster,he's the one to go to Nanny,I can't go charging up to town just to see Sir Ernest,I'm in the middle of the harvest The harvest can do without you for one day Mrs Wentworth can't Mr Llewellyn,I know Diana Wentworth pretty well She's a very old friend of mine She's a very charming person but I'm sure she'll forgive me for saying she knows precious little about politics How many people do? Except of course experts like yourself True,true Still if she got into Parliament,she'd had to make some sort of appearance of knowing That's all right,Diana has got a head screwed on the right way In any case you and the(?)exec what to do then,don't you? Yes Still we got to get her in you know She'll be easy enough surely Widow of an MP who died fighting for his country sponsored by Sir Ernest Foster himself Very impressive Well,there maybe something in it I'll think it over and let you know But Mrs Wentworth knows nothing about politics! Nothing at all This (?),you here of Northaltsea may rest assured that we at central office didn't agree to support this candidate without due consideration Mrs Wentworth,if I may say so, has her head screwed on the right way She'll learn very quickly we should always be there to teach her anything she doesn't know And you could depend on her being a safe party member just what we want at the moment - But if she's opposed? - She won't be Even if she were you have a very good line to take widow of an MP who died fighting for his country and so Yes,but a lot of people in these parts don't like the idea of women in Parliament Come,come don't tell me anyone is afraid she'll start pampering the Prime Minister But Ernest,that's impossible I know nothing about politics nothing at all! That's exactly what Now I don't think that could be quite true can it? After all,no one could have lived with Michael and worked with him so closely year after year,without knowing something about politics Maybe,but that's no excuse for trying to take over his job Besides as I put it to the committee,you got your head screwed on the right way What you didn't know you'll soon pick up and you'll find the whips and the party organization very helpful It's not possible,I couldn't even fight the election Sir Ernest thinks you won't have to she thinks you'd go in unopposed - Precisely - No,I couldn't do it Diana,why the not? Michael wouldn't like it - Good morning Mrs Wentworth. - Morning - Anything for me? - Yes 2 ordinary ones and 5 of them khaki things More forms to fill up Do you know what they say down at the village? No,what? They're saying they allow you the means to put up for Parliament and take the colonel's place - Really? - Yes - Do you think that's a good idea? - No I do not -You know what I say? -No Once they let women go gabbing around running the country nothing will ever be the same again,that's what I say No offense to you Mrs Wentworth But you mark my words nothing will ever be the same again That's a fact! Good morning,Alice Hello ! I'm going to London on Monday,I want you to take me the cab to the 11 o'clock Yes,Mrs Wentworth,I'll be there at the house at half past 10 am - Fine,heard from Harry lately? - Yes He is in North Africa,probably browned-off soon Thinks I'm letting his precious garage go to wrack and ruin That's the last he needs to worry about, remember me to him when you write OK,thanks They're trying to put you up for Parliament in the colonel's place They have asked me,do you think it's a good idea? Well,do and I don't Do some of these dodgy old MPs good to have a few more women there gingering them up But? Well,I think a woman will need to be awfully tough to make an impression on them And I think you would be too gentle with them I arrive ! Good afternoon,you wanted to see me? We really came to see Colonel Wentworth I'm afraid that's impossible Yes,we didn't know they only told us when we got here You see,we've been evacuated We've come all the way from Sanford specially to see him I'm so sorry,is there anything I can do to help? I hardly know You see it's about our small holding We came to ask his advice about it because he was our MP Yes I see,please sit down,will you? He did see us once before.He was always willing to help anybody in trouble -I do not know what we shall do now -There,there Well,we mustn't worry you with our troubles Won't you tell me all about it?Perhaps I can help No Ernest,I definitely made up my mind No,no doubts at all All right,good bye - Nanny,I've got some news for you - Really,Miss Diana? I'm going to stand for Parliament in the Colonel's place No? Well,you do surprise me no mistakes New members that are taking their seats will now come to the table Hear! Hear! "I, Diana Wentworth,do swear... I will be faithful and bear true allegiance to His Majesty King George his heirs and successor as according to Law,so help me God" Mrs Wentworth Northaltsea Hear! Hear! The clerk will now proceed to read the orders of the day Mrs Wentworth! -Put Mrs Wentworth's bag in the car,Max -Certainly - Mrs. Wentworth? - Thank you - I'll be around about 7 - OK Max I know what you're thinking I wasn't think anything,Alice Then you are the only one in the whole village who isn't - Oh,dear is it as bad as that - Worse Look,Mrs Wentworth,can I ask you something? Of course,you can Do you see anything wrong, in me going to the pictures or having a drink with the locals with a boy like Max? No,I don't think so He's a decent chap,he's got a girl of his own back in Detroit There's nothing in it,nothing Well,you know what I mean... He kissed me once - But I soon going to stop to that - Why ? Well,wouldn't do,would it? - I don't know,I was asking you - Well,it wouldn't It's always been Harry with me I thought everyone knew that If you listen to the some of the spiteful old spat in this village you wouldn't think so -Don't let them get you down Oh,I won't,I wanted to marry Harry before he went out east but he wanted to wait Perhaps he was right,I don't know I don't think Harry has got much to worry about Not even if I do rather a Yankee occasionally No, I don't think so It isn't I feel different about Harry at all,it's just that Well,you work all day, 3 nights a week I'm on duty as a warden suppose The others I just do the books and go to bed Every now and then I get to thinking, if I don't get out for 5 minutes and talk to someone I shall go mad - No girl friends? - Oh yes But not the same thing Every now and then a woman gets over the sight of another woman makes her sick She's got to have a man to talk to Besides if Harry can't trust me,I don't want to marry him anyway - Don't worry,Harry is no fool - Oh,I wouldn't be so sure,most men are Especially when they are away from home. Hello Mum,you're awfully late - Hello darling,is your old cold better? - Absolutely gone - Uncle Richard is here - Oh Richard,how nice Richard Just dropped in to say Merry Christmas I hate train journeys in war time Robin,you can go and help and get Mummy the tea OK Were there any bombs dropped in London,Mum? A few,darling The postman said that London will never be the same again Come now and run along Diana,you look all in, alone(?) working here? I suppose so but I shan't have to any longer - Oh,why not? - I've got a secretary - Have you now? Where?Here? - No,she works in the flat mostly - The flat? - Yes,didn't I tell you? No,nobody tells me anything anymore Well,it's tiny, but it's less than a minute from the House A very cranky traveling up and down every day the way the trains are now Or staying in a hotel for weeks on end You might look as though you were pleased Can't expected to be pleased Just being to see you less than ever No,I shall work down here whenever I can get away You know,you've changed. - Have I? - Yes,amazingly Yes I suppose I must have I really haven't had time to notice Oh there's so much to do,and so much to learn, if I'm going to be any good at it So far I've been content to keep my ears and eyes open and my mouth shut Next session,I intend opening my mouth as well Watch and don't put your foot in it Sorry -So I should think -I think I'd better be going now -Oh,must you Rickie -The change is too much for you - Why that? - I was very fond of the old Diana You're not so fond of the new one? That's a leading question Diana! Something I brought for you for Christmas Rickie,how sweet of you Can I open it now? Robin's been told he can't open his till Christmas day I haven't got as much self control as Robin Ricky! Lovely It'll look wonderful on this It would look much better on a wedding dress Diana... I don't suppose you'd be pleased about marrying me Darling,I'm awfully fond of you But only I'm not quite ready for that yet Of course I don't want to rush you,but I had hoped you'd think it was a rather good idea No,it wouldn't be right for either of us just now You see... Everything about my life is changing so quickly I've got a new job,I don't know nearly enough about it I say I want to get out and see people, speak to them,talk to them Find out what they are thinking and feeling what they want out of life Poor Rickie,there's so much to do Oh,at least think of that,will you? Yes,I will Thank you for the lovely present There's the time I got there,Nanny? There's a Sgt Higgins to see you,Madam Higgins? - I don't know any Sgt Higgins,do I Judy? - No,I don't think so - Shall I go and look in the file? - No we'd better go there wherever - Show him in - Very well,Madam I think no to that and that and that and that one is plain silly Oh,Mr Bradshaw Sergeant Higgins,Madam. Effie! I hardly recognized you behind all those stripes - Really Madam? - How nice to see you. You'll stay and have lunch won't you? We can manage one more,can't we,Nanny? Oh yes I think so It should be nice to have some home cooking for a change,won't it? Oh,I don't know Madam food in the the army is very good - Really? - Plain,beautifully cooked -Effie is a cooking instructor now,Madam -Oh,I see - We'll have a long talk after lunch - Yes Madam -Come on Effie -See you later,Effie That was Mrs Hanson,WVF She wants to know what you can do about clothes for the bomb damage - Wait,I'm coming,Nanny! - Yes,Madam Those clothes of the Colonel up in his room when you have a moment I want them all turned out and I'm sending them to WVF - Everything,Madam? - Yes,there's no point of keeping them I'll do it directly when the Sgt's gone Now,where were we? "28 Jan 1944 - St Stephens 30 Jan 1944 - Recovery." You all know the wrought iron gate at the bottom of the drive here Very beautiful and rather valuable But if Northaltsea produces better results this year than last year I give those gates to the service campaign "23 Feb 1944 - Crèche" No woman worth her salt wants to be parted from her babies But no woman with any sense wants to settled with them 24 hours a day Now we can afford to spend thousands on car parks and car park attendance Surely we can afford a few hundreds for baby parks "March 15, 1944 - military canteen for women " they are identical to one 10 thousandth part of an inch. And yet this one costs 20% less than this - You know why? - Yes. Yes,this one was made by a woman "March 30, 1944 - rallying women " This business of standing in queues all day has got to stop It's unhealthy undignified and is unnecessary If the men had to stand in the queues instead of the women They'll do find a way of preventing it And if men can do it we can do it -Diana,I want a word with you -Yes We want you to speak first on the debate on Wednesday Oh That's all you got to say about it? Of course I'm delighted, will I be good enough? We've having plenty of practice lately Besides some of your speeches been creating quite a stir - Have they? - Quite a stir BTW you do know the party line on it,of course - I think so - Just so there shall be no mistake There are only notes,you needn't use no word of them if you don't want to They do make our point of view pretty clear Good luck for your maiden speech Thank you You follow the oaf of (?)and they can really be ready to hear you Mrs Wentworth Mr Speaker On this occasion when I address the House for the first time I crave for my shortcomings that ? for which this House is justly famous Most other members listening to me today will have passed through the same ordeal and will sympathize with me in my task The government,in its wisdom, has placed before this house a bill which I think we can safely say which,I think we can all agree is comprehensive That was the beginning of the speech I had intended to make today Suddenly find I can't go on with it Go on,go on I can't tell you why except I have a feeling Mrs Smith ought to be making this speech instead of me You see,Mrs Smith is the person who is vitally concerned with this bill Few of us know her nearly well enough and some of us scarcely at all But if she's the one this bill is intended to help it's up to us to find out whether it does measure up to her needs or not I like to tell you what I know about her Mrs Smith isn't very interested in statistics because there are no statistics for human emotions or decency or ideals In fact if she were here, she would just tell you quite simply that she is married and has two children When war started her husband was called up, he's fighting now in the jungle in Burma Her two children aren't with either when the Blitz started they were evacuated to the country so she's quite alone now She doesn't like that very much Then the government wanted her to work in an aircraft factory so she got on with the job She's working a 12 hours shift at the moment She doesn't like it but she's been told it's necessary,so she does it When she came home off her shift last night she went home and did her house work and when she's done her housework she put on her tin hat and went out for a night of fire watching The previous night's bomb blew in her windows shook down her ceilings and killed four of her neighbors She was on time at the factory the next morning She writes to her husband every other day and on alternate days she writes to the children. Oh,and I forgot In between while she stands in queues for fish or oranges or trips to shops trying to find a pair of shoes for the children Now when Mrs Smith has time to think which isn't very often She thinks of a happier more pleasant world after the war She wants quite a lot of things out of the post-war world a decent home to live in and in time for the day when Mr Smith and her babies come back to join her not 10 years later mind you but when they come back She wants the best education in the world for her children Especially if she is not so sure they've been learning all they should while they've been evacuated She wants a little money saved against her husband's return And as long as she doing a man's work she doesn't see why she shouldn't have the men's pay packet at the end of the week and that's not all Mrs Smith has earned the right to all these things and a great deal more She going to want an equal say in the government of this country And what does Mr Smith say about that? Order! Order! On this occasion,he's prepared to let his wife have the last word! Good evening Judy - Is she back? - No She said she'd stay about 6 pm I'm waiting for a call now - She's late - She's at the committee They have fun,I gather Yes, she is in the thick of the fray I suppose I didn't wonder That's very thoughtful of you Thank you - That's how you like it? - Perfect Here it is again Hello?Yes She wants you Thank you Hello Diana? Yes Oh I am very sorry Oh my God can't be helped I've got a committee that probably go on till about 11 pm Hello It sounds ominous What is a deputation of my constituents? Look why don't you have dinner and call for me afterwards 1030? All right,good bye,bless you Well,it seems the committee is sitting so I'm stood up Yes, committees always come first Do I detect a note of bitterness? Certainly not.I'm just sorry your evening seems spoiled It's all right,I'll soon get over it - Are you going now? - Yes - I have finished my work. - I (?) - That was close - Yes I suppose I ought to be used to it by now Always panic and grab the first thing that comes to hand I dare say I like it to hand - So am I - Does that always happen? Yes That's always happen - Good evening Mrs Wentworth - Good evening - You needn't come up if you don't want to - I'd like to - I get you a drink? - No thank you - Mind if I have one? - Help yourself-Thank you Look Diana I'm only telling you what people had said I thought you'd like to know Whether you do anything about it at all is entirely your own affair But don't blame me because I repeat it - But you do agree with them,don't you? - That's not fair,I didn't say so - But you do think they're right - Not necessarily That's just hedging That is not hedging,it's none of my business what you do - I'm glad you realized that - Don't worry you made it abundantly clear Good night Richard Good night Richard... Why didn't you do that before? "All my best wishes for your wedding" I come in final as usual everything is all right? Yes,I think so Ah,I must get my breath, then we have a drink I sorted(?)out these bottles,next month's rations will be in by the time we get back I need one Well,let's have it I booked the tables for 400.The hire car will pick you up there at 11 am Thank you Your dress is come it's in the bedroom,Nanny has unpacked it Mr Llewellyn is sending you flowers,I happened to find out so I didn't order any The people at the church has been warned to keep it all aside as possible Mr Llewellyn has got everything else, special license,(?)(?),and so on Your luggage is gone, except for two small bags Mr Llewellyn is coming for those in a few minutes And... I think that's all Thank you,Judy dear I don't know how I should ever have managed without you You could not have taken more trouble if it had been your own wedding It wasn't any trouble,I enjoyed doing it You know,you look all ill It's all right,I think I'm afraid I've been working you too hard,a holiday would do you good Yes,holiday is all I need It's high time you stop talking,and came and change Right,Nanny,I shan't be a second And look don't forget,nobody is to know anything about this until we get back Don't worry,nobody will Pick my (?) press men waiting outside the church It seems funny to be wearing an evening dress again We did lot of these things in peacetime seem funny now Is that the new ring? - Like it ? - It's lovely Nanny,do you think I'm doing the right thing,don't you? Of course - It will be good for Robin too - Yes,he needs someone with a firm hand It isn't that Richard were trying to take Michael's place. This is something quite different Don't worry,dear. He wouldn't have wanted you to be alone all your life Bless you,Nanny. I feel so much better somehow I hope you will be very very happy. You deserve it Thank you Hello? Diana,is that you? Who is it ? Ernest Foster Hello.How did you find me here? I've been trying to locate you for the last hour Fortunately we were able to track your secretary Diana,I must see you at once But I'm leaving in 20 min, I've got a train to catch Won't it wait until I get back? I'm afraid not What is it? Diana,I got a very important news for you. Don't tell me another government crisis This isn't a political crisis,Diana it's a personal one What?I'm sorry,what did you say ? I'm afraid you and Richard won't be able to go away Not go? Listen dear,you know the Russians and the France have overrun several prison camps lately Yes In one of them, they discovered several British prisoners People of whom we've no record whatever Ernest dear,do speak up,will you,this line is dreadful,I can't hear you properly I say,in one of them they discovered several British prisoners People we thought were dead You mean... Yes Diana Michael is one of them I had a word with the department before I left It seems the doctors wanted him to stay in hospital for a week or two But Michael wouldn't have it,he insisted on coming to London. - Ernest,there's nothing very much.. ? - Nothing serious Just complete exhaustion, malnutrition,nothing else Nothing that rest and peace and quiet won't cure But they say you ought to take it easy He oughtn't to be worried by anything for a bit It's all right,he won't be worried by anything Oh thank you Look Do you think that door is open too much for you? No I liked your hair better the way you used to do Did you? Seemed too young somehow Too young... You're not very old I feel it Never mind,looks very nice the way it is So good to have you back I can hardly believe it's true How's Robin? He is fine.

A little thinner perhaps,but otherwise,just the same Yes,just the same A little more difficult one can't be cooked up for years at my age and get away with it entirely -Half starved most of the time -Michael Don't worry,no,I'm not going to make a flesh creep with my lurid tales I keep those for the House of Commons Colonel Wentworth enters the House cheers resounded from end to end of the historic chamber Or didn't it? -What about opening that case of(?)Nanny? -Yes,Sir Poor Nanny,she'll never forgiven me for growing up She is very devoted Fidelity is always touching Come and sit down I will directly I must give Nanny a hand with that box first What are you doing with my rod? I didn't know you were back. I never heard the car Never mind about the rod, let me have a look at you I hope you're quite well That's very considerate of you, I might be worse - And what of you? - I'm all right I think - At school? - All right,I think. Good I think you're feeling jolly tired You are right to rest I think I just go and see what Mummy is doing No,no,don't run away And don't let anyone mention the word rest to me Tell me what you've been doing Nothing much,just mucking about How long have you been with the long trousers? Since my birthday. I am 13 No Grey hairs yet. The war news is very good,isn't it? We seem to be actually rushing ahead everywhere Are we? What was the roses like this year? There aren't any more, there are cabbages now There aren't any wrought iron gate either Mummy gave them to salvage She made a speech about it She did what? I forgot,I wasn't to speak about this Why,was the speech such a rotten one? No,it was jolly good I can't understand it,she often makes speeches? Yes. No,I don't really know - What the mystery? - Nothing. I expect you saw an awful lot of chaps killed,where you've been,didn't you? I saw a whole lot who would been happier killed Tell me about the speeches, it's much more important. I don't know anymore I think... I just go and see what Mummy is doing Mummy got to see what Nanny is doing I expect the thing about supper It made all the extra work,you see,with your coming home I am sorry Venning,did you come across old brown velvet jacket? - No Sir - In the cupboard? No Sir,there is nothing in the cupboard Venning Do you mind ask Nanny whether all my clothes were given away,will you? Yes,Sir Oh,Michael In fact they were And Lazarus came forth from the tomb Darling,I knew you'd understand. when we thought Excuse me,Madam It would have been rather selfish and sentimental to have kept them Sentimental? All those people being bombed out Of course,you're perfectly all right Can I have a bath,or has that been taken to salvage too? Of course you can have a bath,I'll run it for you myself Diana Come straight back She's a peach - Who ? - Mrs Wentworth - Yes,you could call her that,yes - I'll say you could She's a proper eye for it,no mistake I bet the boys came buzzing around that when they thought the governor was not for good,eh? If they did,she soon sent them buzzing off again He's still asleep No,I'm not You looked just as you were fast asleep -I was thinking. -He brought you up some breakfast Nice light diet When do we kill the fatted calf,Nanny? I think we could manage with another egg Venning will give you his Oh,nonsense,I wouldn't hear of it -Really how long have I've been asleep? -About 14 or 15 hours -How did I come to fall asleep like that? -You were worn out,Sir You fell asleep while Madame was running your bath That reminds me,where is Madam? Round to the farm,Sir, up right there she was What on earth for? Well,you see food is harder to come by than it was before you went away - She's gone to beg for a chicken - Beg for a chicken?Can't we pay for one? Nowadays,it isn't the matter whether you could pay for a thing or not It's a matter whether you're a friend of the butchers or not And if you aren't Heaven help you I tried to write to you a note, but the right words wouldn't come There was no need for a note,I'd have understood I know you would There's no good putting it off we got to talk about eventually and decide what are we going to do There's only thing you can do, you must stay with him I know you're right, but... He's practically a stranger He is your husband - You might have been that by the day - I don't need to reminded me Darling,I didn't mean it like that Look let's be logical about this He is my husband He is tired and ill having such a tile(?) of a try of adjust himself to his rambling - We all have to do that - Yes, but... he's so lost He is like a child,who had a long illness. Suddenly started to get better to find that the world's grown up while he's been away So you are going to mother him That's right What about you ? I don't know, Richard,just don't know Diana,you know I'll do anything you say You know I love you Yes And him? I am not sure... For the moment,I just feel sorry for him -That will be quite enough you'll find -Then I know he needs me desperately This is why Oh darling I wish I knew what was the right thing to do Grief, what have they done to this room I beg you pardon? On(?) I'm Judy Meredith - How do you do,I am Michael Wentworth - Yes,I realize that I've seen your picture Did you alter the room like this? No,it's always been like this Indeed it hasn't -Do you live here? -No,I live in town I only stay here when Mrs Wentworth wants me to help her Well,don't let me prevent you being helpful Thank you I'm only merely looking for a book Can I help you? Oh,no no,thank you You go on helping my wife,I'll help myself I beg you pardon,I'm afraid I'm disturbing you Not at all -There are some letters for you here -Ah, already? There's yours -And those? -They are Mrs. Wentworth's Really?She must be a very regular correspondent That's nothing really you see the post she has in town -In town? -Yes,at the flat What flat? Don't you know about the flat? No,should I? Mrs Wentworth will wish to tell you about it herself no doubt No doubt Tell me... Tell me,are there any wrought iron gates at the flat? Wrought iron gate? No,I don't think so No,of course not,why? Well,just wondering Thank you for setting my mind at rest "Mrs. D. Wentworth, MP" Diana... -Is this true? -Yes Michael That's what Robin meant, about you making speeches Yes Do you mind? Well,I don't know yet - How long has it been going along? - Ever since you... Since we thought you were dead Ernest suggested it They only did? Is it so funny? I'd better get used to it, but... You of all people you do know the least thing about it I suppose I'm silly and inconceivable I have worked very hard, and I do know quite a lot about it now - What was your majority? - I was unopposed - Why was that? - I don't know,no one else stood up Some serve I suppose, widow's weep and all that Yes perhaps My husband gave his life for his country For those of you who hold his memory dear,I will say this: Elect me in his place I always wanted to know what it serves like to be an MP It wasn't at all like that I'm sure it weren't,I am sorry Come and talk to me and grab me You see... I woke up and you weren't there I was frightened You must be there. Always Don't worry You will always be there Happy? You don't resent me being back? Resent ?Michael,what a thing to say Well,must a bit of a bore having a husband that you believed dead suddenly appearing from nowhere Michael,why couldn't you let us know? Well,it's a long story... I'll tell you some day not now All right - Do you know what I'd like? - No? I would like everything to be just as it was before the war As if the war had never happened I'd like to watch a cricket match on the village green Walk back home for tea through the woods The postman says things will never be the same again He is very mournful Will you mind very much? What? Give up everything up,and being a wife again? Do you really want me to give everything up? Yes I think so don't you ? I don't know Michael Why do you want me to give everything up? Because I want you back again But you got me,you still have me whether I work or not! That's mean I'll see you 5 minutes as you trip from meeting to meeting - It isn't as bad as that - But it is I don't want a wife who forever making speeches and being Madam chairman on committees I want the wife I left behind And I'm not the only one either, there are thousands like me,millions Fellows who in peace time wanted nothing better than a a pint of beer on the way home, picture on Saturday night... They're coming back soon,you know They want to come back to the life they knew to the woman they loved,and not... not something different But darling things are different. I've got a job now,an important job The job happens to be mine. Michael... You mean you want to it back again Yes Please You look so lovely All right,don't worry I don't want to be a nuisance Darling,I'm so sorry. There's nothing to be sorry about You must give me time to get used to you being here Mind much of a stranger and all that? No, of course. Yes,I think you are. It isn't easy to put the clock back for you Don't you know that I not realize that? It isn't easy for me either Of course not, we are both in the same boat. Are we really in the same direction? Michael,it isn't that I do not love you. - Isn't it? - No! But it's all the years between The years between They've got a lot to answer for,haven't they? I think I shall go up to London this morning. Up to the flat? Yes,I've got a lot of work to clear out and I want time and peace to think Maybe gone about 3 or 4 days I see That will give you time to settling down here and give us both time to think and adjust ourselves Yes,by all means let us adjust at the role Then maybe when you're rested, you might come up to London and join me Thank you I think I shall stay here then you can join me Michael,won't you,please, try to understand? I might ask you that All right I'll give you a ring this afternoon Thank you. Hello? Michael? Hello Richard,my dear fellow,how are you? Very well thank you Good,when are you coming over to see us? I'd like to I'll tell you I'll give you a ring some time,look Michael, your son just fallen in our stream - Is he all right? - Perfectly,soaked to the skin,of course Do you think you can get Ames to bring over a change of clothes for him? Yes,of course.I'll bring one over myself now No... don't bother to do that There's no bother,looking forward to see you again,I'll be right over Richard! -Hello there! -Hello Michael -Here are the clothes -Thank you,Doris I'm afraid young Robin being a rather nuisance No,not at all,he's perfectly all right Doris, take this up to Master Robin,will you,please -Yes,Sir -Thank you No it is,it wasn't very deep,no harm done just got soaked to the skin that's all He seems to mad about fishing I'm afraid that's a kind of my fault,I encouraged him Richard... Diana told me... She did? Yes about,you helping her with business matter,money and on accounting and I'm very grateful Oh,nothing at all,it was the least I could do After all, I've been safe and snug here while you've been out there You don't need to have an inferiority complex about it just because your game let kept you here - You've done a great job - Nothing compared what you've been through Michael? Why didn't you let anyone know you were in that prison camp? I was there under a false name If the Germans had found who I really was... Well,I don't suppose I should be here now Why? I had some information they wanted rather badly Surely Michael after 5 years! I wasn't in a prison camp for more than half that time What? And what on earth were you doing? Working underground Underground? They sent me out to organize the resistance movement They wanted someone who knew the country,languages It was rather fun while it lasted And the beauty of it was that the Jerry never did discover who was the back of it - Surely somebody must have known - No,only intelligence They worked the whole thing out even arranging for my plane to crash You see I had to be well and truly disposed of so nobody could connect anything with me So, I... disappeared, in an official puff of smoke You mean it was all planned from the start before you left here? The intelligence arranged everything You did it deliberately knowing that Diana... knowing that the world would presume you dead? Yes Surely you could have told Diana My orders were to tell no one Not even your wife? Not even my wife Didn't you sometimes wonder what people at home were thinking? Yes,my worst nightmare was dreaming that I'll come back ... to find Diana married to someone else What would you have done, if she had? Of course I wanted to kill myself - Hello Robin! - Hello dad - Recovered ? - Yes,sound and fit Excuse me It's almost queer without uncle Richard at the house He was always there before - Before what? - Before you came home Your's hadn't been such bad war has it,Robin? We had several bombs. One only half a mile away There's an enormous crater there still I wasn't thinking about the bombs What were you going to do for holiday if I hadn't come back? I was going to stay with Dawson for this week and next while Mam and Uncle Richard were up in Scotland Scotland?Where were they going in Scotland? I don't know,some quiet place,Nanny says I only know that they had to be back by the 29th,because of a meeting in London. We were all three going up to the flat and have a week there doing theater and things before I went back to school It seems... selfish of me to have spoiled the plans Goodbye Richard. And thanks for everything. Are you coming Robin? I understand perfectly that there's no reason I shouldn't go back next week if I want to You see Michael,it isn't as easy as all that There's no precedence as I've heard of,how are you to go into it? There's nothing to go into,I'm the elected member of Northaltsea I went to the war at the government's request and I've come back safe and sound I want my seat Well,I've to talk to the speaker about it You've been presumed dead,you know? I'm not dead I know,I know But don't you think,look here there will be a general election in a few months anyway,why not take it easy Diana is very popular,very efficient let her carry on to the end I don't want to take it easy I want my job back,now What are you going to do when it's all over? Ask me the old job I expect -What was that? -Sergeant(?) - No,I mean before the war - That's right,sergeant Commissioner - Where? - The Palladium, Finsbury Park. Hardly seems like a man's job to me Oh? I like to see a woman who could do it When you see a woman in the uniform, covered with medals all over her... and shouting "Standing in 1 and 9! 6 and 2! 6 and 3! " You feeling there is a war too? No. Why,you? Why?Why not? He's terribly shot about you know,lost the leg Poor Harry! I'm so sorry It was an awful shock to me first I made up my mind it wasn't going to make any difference I said, I don't care how he comes back, he's mine and I'm going to marry him I thought I could run the garage and he could look after the books in the firm and all that sort of things We manage between Now he says no - Does he say why? - Yes He says no one has got the right to come back and find things just the same as they went away He says the man I got engaged to doesn't exist any more And he's not going to beholden to anyone What does he want to do then? They are training him to telephone operator He says he'll sell the garage to me if I like or if not he sell it anyway and give me half the proceeds - That's very generous. - I don't want half the proceeds I want Harry - Have you told him that? - Yes, but he's so blasted pigheaded Can't see anyone else's point of view I wonder if you'd speak to him - Well,I'll try - Oh, thanks a lot You don't know how important it is to me You know... it must be nice to be like you To have your husband at home and no troubles Yes Hello Nanny,anyone home? The colonel is out and Robin, Mr Llewellyn is waiting in the drawing room Mr Llewellyn? Yes,he rang up,I told him you'll be home this evening He's been waiting since 8 o'clock Thank you Nanny Richard Diana I had to come,we can't go on like this I know,that's why I came back Why did you go? I wanted to get away from everybody when I made up my mind what to do -Have you? -Yes It's Michael? No,it's you if you still want me Oh darling Saw Ernest,when I was in London,he told me all about Michael and what he'd done Do you remember that day he went away? Yes He knew then that he was to be reported killed He said good bye to me and I kissed him and said, "Come back safe" He knew then that a week later I should get a telegram saying he was dead And he never told me -Perhaps he had orders not to -Perhaps It doesn't matter anyway I could forgive him that if there weren't anything to do What I can't forgive is to keeping up the secrecy after he'd been captured He could easily had let me know that he was alive 2 years ago -I suppose you're sure of that? -Of course that's what finally decided me I couldn't to you before because I was thinking of him I thought, he's been through hell He needs me more than Richard does I didn't know then that he was perfectly capable of taking care of himself Now I do know,I am ready I come to you whenever you want me Richard,haven't you anything to say? Diana it's no good,I've got to tell you It wasn't like that at all -What was ? -What happened to Michael He couldn't have told you before he went away because he had strict orders not to tell anybody Yes but after,after he was captured? Had he let anyone known then, had given away the whole show All the work he'd been doing underground might had cost the lives of dozen of men he'd been working with He wanted to tell you,all right but he couldn't -How do you know? -Michael told me He told me that his worst nightmare was imaging you marrying again -He said that? -Yes Richard,I'm so muddled Darling have you told Michael about us? No Don't you think it'd be better? Perhaps so,I don't know I'd think you'd better put your cards on the table Tell him,we were going to be married Tell him everything I think that's the only way Oh Richard Excuse me Please don't go on my account They have to(?) best to go No I,I think you should hear the news It may be a historic moment "In accordance with the arrangement between the 3 great powers an official announcement will be broadcast by the Prime Minister at 3 am tomorrow afternoon Tuesday, May 8th. so tomorrow will be treated as the V day and the whole day will be regarded as a holiday The day after,Wednesday, May 9,... " Peace finds us ill prepared Mark my word Charlie,this time will never be the same again "The day of victory" "The peace" Michael... Yes I just had a letter from Ernest He told me that you're claiming your seat That's right Why did you do that without telling me? Should I tell you everything? You tell me everything? You mean about Richard... I was just going to tell you today he wanted me to Please don't bother, I'm not really interested You should be Why? I'm not the first man who had his wife stolen from him while he is away at the war Quite a common thing they tell me Michael... you know it isn't like that at all I agreed to marry Richard but I thought you were dead Had been dead for 3 years If you'd come back just one week later,he and I would have been man and wife We neither of us have anything to be ashamed of Richard behaves wonderful, he agreed to go away and leave me to come back to you I don't want anyone's charity Is that really all you have to say? What else is it for me to say? That I don't think you've been fair to a man who's gone through hell for his country But I can't live without you? I don't want to say anything you don't need Well,then has only got this to say I love you. It's a pity you didn't think of that the day you said goodbye to me I thought of nothing else But you didn't love me enough to tell me about what you were planning I had to choose between my inclination and my duty My orders was to tell nobody Not even your prospective widow? Do you think it was easy? Do you think I didn't realize the risks I was taking? I knew perfectly well that was I lucky enough to come back I might find you married to someone else I knew it was a gamble, but I thought I could somehow could gamble ... on you. Well... I gambled and lost Don't let so (?) We must go our own ways Very well,Michael If that's what you want it It is I'll go up to the flat this afternoon, Richard can join me there About the seat Damned seat I've already applied for Chiltern Hundreds I'll put up somewhere else again in the general election You must do what you think best Oh Nanny... I'm leaving I want you to pack all my things I've just taken an overnight bag now send for the rest of my things next week Ask Venning to call me for a taxi will you? Do you mean you're leaving the colonel? Is that what you say? Yes Nanny,that's what I'm saying Is this true,Sir? It looks like it,doesn't it? But you can not do that! You can't either of you be so silly - Too late,it's done. - What about Robin? Robin will stay with his father Who is going to tell him? It's no use looking at me this time Twice I have had to tell that boy that his whole life been changed around him and I'm not going to do it a 3rd time not for anyone His father will tell him Don't you want to tell him yourself? Not particularly You say that I'm an interfering old woman but There's something else I want to say I never told you about this before because it hurts too much Did it ever occurred to you to wonder why I never married? I was going to be,to a nice boy, but... he was killed on the Somme in the last war I didn't know,Nanny,I'm sorry You've no cause to be sorry There are hundreds like me, in this war as well as the last Women whose men won't come back to them But there are thousands more like you,women whose men will come back to them Men they didn't even expect to see again Men they didn't very much want to see again -Nanny that's not fair -I know it's nor one sided There'll be thousands of men coming back who won't make allowances for what their wives have been through while they've been away Men who'll expect to find nothing changed Even though they've changed themselves But that's not the point It's this Somebody has got to start a little give and take You heard what the Prime Minister said the other day on the wireless. He said : Nations got to collaborate, and... and have faith in one another, if there is ever going to be peace But if people like you can't do it how could you expect nations too? Have you got so big that you can't be the wife of your husband anymore? And have you got so important that you can't bear to see your wife doing something just as well as you did it? You mean to say that you are incapable of working together? -Nanny that's enough -Yes it is Quite enough I said my say, I can't do any more There's peace in the world again It's starting today But if you two are an example of what's going to happen then we might as well have the war again right away Because we've lost the peace Lost it before it ever started I won't have anything to do with it,do you hear? I don't want anything to do with it This is London. Prime Minister Right Hon Winston Churchill. Today is the day of victory, and the war ends tonight. There is peace in the world again, starting today But if you two are an example of what's going to happen and we might as well has the war again right away Because we lost the peace Lost it before it ever started Judy, give me some pen and paper... Judy,notepaper! Give this to Richard when he comes They look very happy,don't they? Yes The trouble is that they don't know what's ahead of them But everything is going to be all right now,isn't it? You really think so,don't you? Yes I do Don't you? I wonder You're ruining your eyes,if you don't stop reading and come to bed Colonel Wentworth The right honorable member... Subtitles by Nostromo
