I travelled through space and time and returned to this world. I'm glad about this work. - Like Jack the Ripper! - Like a skilled magician he distracts the attention by a movement of his right hand while he commits the act with his left hand. [ Kishibo ] This summer is going to be hot so I bought breathable underwear. Tomorrow, I'll send them by courier. You're at home in the morning, aren't you? How many did you buy? - 2... 4... 8 pieces. - So many!? A few are for Shirou. That boy sweats so much. Don't do such unreasonable things. Shirou is already dead. THE CONFESSION OF JACK THE RIPPER - INSPECTOR INUKAI HAYATO - Excuse me, are you alright? Are you feeling unwell? - I'm Aso from Criminal Investigation Division Section 1. - Thanks for your hard work. Thanks for your hard work. You have one for me, haven't you? The greatest legend in the eyes of the police. Even for me it's the first time to see such a corpse. - Did you eat breakfast? - No. Then, you have nothing to vomit. All internal organs were cleanly cut out. Not one has been left. The victim is Rokugo Yumika, 21, single, employed at a credit union in Tokyo City. Driver licence and wallet were inside of her bag, and since the money wasn't taken out, I guess we can exclude robbery. He just came from Saitama Prefectural Police for a training course. - I'm Kotegawa. Pleased to meet you. - Then, good luck. This is coroner Mikuriya. Still, an immediate assignment at the scene of such a gruesome murder, that's not what you had expected, right? You look bad. Are you alright? - Of course, I'm alright. - Okay. Then, lunch today is my treat. Let's go eat meat udon. Don't get so excited. Make a short trip to the hospital. - No, I'm really alright. - I'm not worried about you. Teito University Hospital. Inukai should be there. Bring him here. Today, your condition is pretty good, isn't it? It's remarkably stable, the doctor said. Is there anything you want? A healthy body. I want a healthy body. You must ask Majikina-sensei for that. I'm not a doctor. I know. No matter how many criminals you catch, it won't heal my illness, right? - Is there anything else you want? - This is all I want. Then, I'll come again. Inukai-san, you're here for a visit again? Yes... well... I see. Sayaka-san's hypersensitivity is probably caused by the dialysis. It's not your fault. Among our dialysis patients with that kind of kidney disease Sayaka-san is one of the most patient. I'm sure you don't have to worry. Don't say things that only exist in your mind. I'm sorry. You always paint things the way it's convenient for you. Well, I'm very sorry. My wife said something unnecessary again. No... Speaking of it, just now, after 5 years, my daughter asked me for a present. She said she wanted a healthy body. Do you have a moment? If we continue with the artificial dialysis, we can certainly suppress the uremia. However, her condition won't become better than it is now. - Is Sayaka dying? - No, we're far away from the worst case. However, in the end stage of kidney failure, continuing the dialysis or a kidney transplantation are the only ways to sustain life. Excuse me. This is transplant coordinator Takano. - Takano Chiharu is my name. - I'm Inukai. If you give your consent, we will register Sayaka-san as applicant for an organ transplantation. However, whether we'll find a donor who fits in well with her will solely depend on her luck. Please do so. Thank you very much. Inukai-san? Yesterday, I was assigned to CID Section 1. Kotegawa is my name. - I've heard of your reputation since a long time. - I'm off duty this morning. Aso-san wants you to come immediately. In Woodside Park a body whose organs were cut out was found. Then, we'll begin the investigation meeting with the murdered woman in Woodside Park. First, the report about the victim. The victim is Rokugo Yumika, 21, employed at Tojo Credit Union, Toyocho Branch. She was living with her parents. What were the victim's last activities? She finished work and went home at around 8 pm yesterday evening. After dinner, she told her mother she would go out for a moment. She left the house at around 9:40 pm and we think she went to Woodside Park. - What about her relationships? - As far as her parents know, she didn't seem to have any close friends. I went to her workplace to confirm it and they said the same. At present, we have no hint to a relationship with the other sex. So the possibility of an enmity seems to be low. Any witnesses? In the vicinity of the crime scene there are scattered mansions, but since it was a hot and humid night, apparently all windows were closed because of the air condition and therefore we still have no eyewitness report about the victim from nearby residents. Furthermore, on the only security camera in the park neither the victim nor a suspicious person are to be seen. That's all. In such a large park there's only one camera? Who's in charge of the victim's cell phone? That's me. We searched the crime scene but couldn't find it. I think probably the perpetrator took it away. That's all. The only thing that's gone is the cell phone. The perpetrator will have called the victim over this phone, don't you think? I've understood very well that you're brilliant. - Be quiet and listen. - I'm sorry. Next, the post-mortem examination report. The victim's internal organs were completely extracted, but according to the autopsy findings the direct cause of death was something like a rope that constricted her neck and strangulated her. Estimated time of death is between 10 pm and 12 pm last night. Judging from the amount of blood at the scene, probably the perpetrator called the victim to the crime scene, and after strangling her opened the body with a sharp blade on the spot and removed the organs, I think. According to the coroner, a special technique called Y-incision was used to dissect the body. For this Y-incision a special scissors called rib shears and an electric knife are needed. In other words, the perpetrator - has knowledge of autopsy and... - A doctor? With high probability it's a member of the medical professions, right? Or a student of medicine, or a forensic scientist. It might even be a coroner. This is obviously a provocation towards the police. The perpetrator boldly committed a crime right before our eyes. For now, we've ordered to withhold the information about the organ removal from the news media, but it's only a matter of time till it gets known. Once it gets known, out of fear the citizens will start blaming the police. All of you here, keep in mind! The reputation of the police depends on the quickest possible arrest of the perpetrator. A delay of 1 day... no, a delay of 1 second only, and our prestige will be shattered! - Understood? - Yes! Dismissed! - Commissioner Tsurusaki is full of vim and vigor. - So it seems, doesn't it? It made the blood rush to my cheeks. It's the long-awaited big case after all. If I solve it smoothly, my advancement to police inspector is in range of vision. It will set my career back on track. A person was killed in a brutal way. How can you think of your promotion? And you, what do you think about this case? - It's neither enmity nor robbery. - What then? Couldn't it be lust of murder? Well, at this stage this is only one of the possibilities. - But... - But? I don't think it's over with this. We should examine the victim's personal environment once again. At least the perpetrator seems to have known her cell phone number or address. Inukai. Before that, there's something important to do. Downstairs, the parents of the victim are waiting. Explain the circumstances and take them to the morgue. Understood. Letting the family see the body is the least job a normal person would like to do. Why do you leave it to Inukai-san? When his wife gave birth to his daughter, even when his wife died in an accident, that guy stood there without showing any emotions. And when this only daughter of him fell ill with kidney failure too. In order to keep doing this job it's important to rid yourself of your emotions. Rid yourself of your emotions? Shall I tell you why he achieved by far the highest arrest rate in the last few years? Yes. He isn't fooled by his emotions. He sees through his counterpart. A lie doesn't work with him. When you're talking with him, don't you have the feeling of being completely seen through? I don't like to admit it, - but I'm glad that he's my subordinate. - He can recognize a lie... You don't have to stay in the office. Instead, follow Inukai and learn a few things from him, okay? Yes. The day before yesterday, I saw a UFO. - I saw it too. - No way! Sorry, it was a lie. Why? Just when she could live a normal life again. Why! [ Kanto Central Television ] Hyodo-san! This arrived for "Afternoon Japan". [ The woman's organs were removed ] [ I travelled through space and time and returned to this world ] [ The incident in Woodside Park is my work ] [ It took extraordinary skill ] [ I couldn't give her the time to cry for help ] [ I'm glad about this work ] [ - Jack - ] What's that? It's incredible. Good afternoon, Ladies and Gentlemen. We will begin with a follow-up report on the case of the dead woman who was found in Woodside Park. This morning, "Afternoon Japan" received an envelope from a person who seems to be the perpetrator. This envelope specified a detail that only the perpetrator or persons in charge of the case could know and contained a letter showing the following claim of responsibility. Here is the full text of the claim of responsibility. I travelled through space and time and returned to this world. The incident in Woodside Park is my work. It took extraordinary skill. I couldn't give her the time to cry for help. I'm glad about this work. - Jack - The name "Jack" at the end of the claim of responsibility rings a bell. This "Jack" is probably imitating a weird murderer in 19th century England called "Jack the Ripper" who committed indiscriminate serial killings. This indicates that the perpetrator is acting from lust of murder. Why did you publish that letter without consulting the investigation headquarters? I had the intention to contact you, but we had a communication failure. A news media with a communication failure? Can I borrow the letter from the criminal? Yes. - Who touched this letter? - Only me and the AD (Assistent Director). Because we sent a copy to the news station. I see. I'm very sorry to trouble you, but please give us the fingerprints of the both of you. Of course. Excuse me, I'd like to make a suggestion. What suggestion? Of course, we will hand this important evidence over to you. And the next time we receive a message from the criminal, we will report it first, naturely. But, in return, can't you give us priority regarding informations about future developments? The fact that the perpetrator sent the letter to us means he wants to use us as communication base, doesn't it? In other words, the perpetrator is certainly watching "Afternoon Japan". In this case, the police might even be able to get a connection to the criminal through us. If that happens, it could lead to a speedy solution of the case, I think. We want to cooperate with you. Hyodo-san, don't tell me lies. You want to cooperate with us? To me, it sounds like you try to make us cooperate to boost the audience rating of your program. It seems you've got 2 things wrong. We're grateful for your cooperation, but from our point of view you're still common citizens and common citizens must not interfere in a case. And the other one; You said there's a condition for handing this envelope over to us, but if you don't hand out important evidence that leads to the perpetrator in a murder case, this must be regarded as if you perhaps wanted to cover up for the culprit. If you wish, you can accompany us to the station. Furthermore, seen precisely, it's also possible that your fingerprints don't derive from the time when you opened the envelope but from the time when you wrote that letter. Are you saying I'm a suspect? Thank you for your cooperation. EEG is flat. No spontaneous breathing. He's in a very serious condition. No... no! Shohei! Hey! Your son carried an organ donor card as declaration of intention to donate his organs. You're going to take out Shohei's organs? No, no. The decision on donating or not - lies with the family alone. - Don't say such selfish things! It came in handy for you, didn't it? All of a sudden, we heard our son was brought to hospital and when we rushed here, we were told he's brain-dead. We didn't even have the time to say goodbye. And then, to cap it all, you want his organs! Shohei is still alive, he's still warm, isn't he? And his heart is beating! It's as you say. Shohei-san is still alive. I'm transplant coordinator Takano. I'm very sorry, but I happened to hear your conversation right now. Unfortunately, Shohei-san's brain is dead. But Shohei-san's other parts, as you said, are still alive. If they became part of another patient now, they could live on. I suppose you don't have a child. Takasato-san... Because you don't have a child you can say such heartless things. What do you know of Shohei! It's true, I've never got acquainted with Shohei-san. I don't know his personality, neither his lifestyle nor his hobbies. But there's one thing that I know. Your son was a wonderful person who could empathize with other people. Be quiet! If you say more of such stupid things... Wait please. Shohei can inside of another person's body live on, can't he? Yes. - Then, do it please. - You... As you said, Shohei is a kind boy who's considerate of other people. Let's do what this boy wanted. Please. Thank you very much. Shohei-san's intention will certainly not be in vain. I suppose you don't have a child. Because you don't have a child you can say such heartless things. Midori! Midori! On the envelope as well as the letter are only the fingerprints of the TV people. And it's impossible to identify the printer on which it was printed. The perpetrator proceeded very carefully and left not a single piece of evidence. He wouldn't make such a blunder. "Jack the Ripper"... Shit! Now there's no point in hiding that the organs were removed anymore. Why? In 19th century England, Jack the Ripper murdered at least 5 prostitutes. He killed all his victims by cutting their throat with a sharp blade and then took their organs out. That's not all. Jack sent a provocative claim of responsibility to a major newspaper company in London. So it became a sensational crime. Kanto Central Television carefully even published the name "Jack". Thanks to that, tomorrow the station will be flooded with letters saying "I'm Jack reborn". It's already huge on the internet. If the perpetrator is imitating Jack the Ripper, as Inukai-san said, the case may not be over yet. Why did he choose that woman? The perpetrator is a well-prepared person who didn't leave a single piece of evidence. So if we take an unprejudiced look at his way of proceeding, he must have had a reason for choosing this victim. If he's imitating his historic namesake... Was the victim a prostitute? I will check the personality of the victim and the people around her once again. Where is your father today? He will be working. It would be nice if he came visiting you more often, wouldn't it? He won't come. Why should he come. I don't want him to come. He abandoned mother and me. This man is not my father. I inject the muscle relaxant. Please begin. I begin with the organ extraction. - Scalpel. - Here. - Cooper. - Here. - Aortic cross clamp. - Here. Cardiac arrest. - Scalpel. - Here. Hello. A few steps from here is a coffee shop that's open till late in the evening. Let's talk there. Just now, one car has arrived. Only the cell phone and the organs were taken away. The Y-shaped incision is exactly as the one before. Who had thought the 2nd incident would happen so fast, huh? The victim is Hanzaki Kiriko, 32. She worked for a home appliance wholesaler in Tokyo and lived in an appartment by herself. Yesterday, she left the office at 9 pm and went directly to the scene, as we think. The site is undeveloped land that's allocated for the construction of mansions. Estimated time of death between 10 pm and 12 pm. No witnesses and no close friends of the victim. Just like in the first case, there are absolutely no clues. Shit. This is too disgusting. Why Jack the Ripper? - Even if he imitates criminals of the past... - Kotegawa, do you think it's just an imitation? - What do you mean? - It's still guesswork, but supposed the name "Jack the Ripper" had not appeared, what would you think is the purpose behind all this? The purpose behind it? The perpetrator is intelligent and acts methodically. It doesn't seem likely to me that such a person repeats a crime just because he longs to be like Jack the Ripper. Indeed. Supposed he's not imitating Jack the Ripper, why is it necessary to remove the organs? Among all the guys who removed organs, Jack the Ripper is the most famous. You think that's why he used that name? From the very beginning, I had my doubts. The more a criminal is careful, the more timid he is. But this perpetrator boasts of the notorious name "Jack" without hesitation and stages a theatrical crime. He must derive some kind of benefit from this. However, like a skilled magician he distracts the attention by a movement of his right hand while he commits the act with his left hand. You think he uses the name "Jack" as a smoke screen? If that's so, why the Hell were the organs removed? This is what we don't know yet. If the perpetrator had a concrete purpose, the selection of the victims was not random. However, the 2 victims were of different age and had no mutual acquaintances. Rokugo Yumika-san worked at a credit union. Hanzaki Kiriko-san could have been a customer there. Or, they may have been both members of the same online-shopping site. No matter how trivial it is what they had in common, we must find it. Yes. I'm very sorry. I'll be back in 2 hours. - Inukai-san... - He's going to visit his daughter. It's like a ritual. Perhaps it's a kind of atonement. The dialysis is over. She's sleeping now. Inukai-san! Do you have a minute? Sayaka-chan is uneasy because of the transplantation. I'm very sorry. Sayaka-chan told me a lot about you and also your late wife. I'm a terrible father who immerses himself in his work and neglects his family. I abandoned her but it couldn't be helped. When your wife died you placed Sayaka-chan into external care, right? But Sayaka hated it. That's why I can't accomodate her in any institution. The reason was not that Sayaka-chan is important to you? This is very embarrassing for me to say, but Sayaka-chan doesn't want you to come anymore. I see. Well, then tell Sayaka please that I'll come again next week. This is the line I draw. It's the first time I meet a person like you. When I talk about organ transplantation, the family of the patient always show a mixture of hope and anxiety. But you... If you care about Sayaka-chan, talk properly with her please. I don't know what's your profession. But, isn't Sayaka-chan your irreplaceable family? Sorry, I said too much. Excuse me. I didn't hear anything. Sorry, I heard it. Um... please go visiting her more often. Not only once a week. I was told my daughter didn't want me to come anymore. That's certainly not true. Don't you understand why your daughter is lying? I was abandoned by my mother when I was little and hated her. But somewhere in my heart I felt I wanted to hug her again. I didn't want to admit it, though. That's why... your daughter also... Sorry, it just slipped out of my mouth. So... why are you here? I don't know how it's related to the case, but I found one point the victims have in common. Please look at this. On Rokugo Yumika-san's flank and on Hanzaki Kiriko-san's chest is a postoperative scar. Why? Just when she could live a normal life again. Sorry. It may be meaningless, but just in case... No. It was well observed. - Kotegawa. - Are you with Inukai? Come back immediately! And tell Inukai to keep his cell phone always switched on. Kanto Central Television received a 2nd letter from Jack. Kanto Central Television received from Jack a 2nd claim of responsibility. I'm here to cooperate. "They were both persons who deserved to die." "The reason will soon become clear to the public." "Even in the future the Last Supper will continue." "So, in order to be easy to distinguish from copycat criminals, I enclose a part of the body." A part of the body? The parcel contained a thumb-sized piece of meat. The forensic investigation says it belongs to Hanzaki Kiriko. - It's part of her kidney. - Her kidney... Politely, he's going even this far to imitate Jack the Ripper. He wrote this will go on. "Persons who deserved to die", what's that supposed to mean? Didn't you find any clues! Excuse me... It may sound impertinent, but can't you let Kanto Central Television cooperate with you on this? What? As it is now, we're in a completely different situation. It's no exaggeration to say that Jack's writing changed the scenario. - Is this alright for you? - What do you want to say? Jack seems to be quite a smart person who leaves no evidence at the crime scene, right? Actually, the only clue Jack has left is his establishment of contact with us. Therefore, this is the only tool you can use. Use the program to communicate with Jack? - Exactly. - What you say sounds good, but you only want to gain access to all informations in order to write your own scenario. This is news business. Please trust in our capabilities. We can appeal to the people that you're excellent and bring the public opinion on your side. Let's start our own attack and unsettle Jack in return! The other side commits crimes under the eyes and nose of the police. He prepares them carefully and is convinced that we don't have any clue. In this situation, what can you do to unsettle him? Are you giving up! We don't have any clue because you guys work the case sloppily! Are you saying it's our fault? I say the other side is convinced that we don't have any clue. That's all I will say. - Inukai? - Kotegawa. Yes. Did you understand anything of that? Do you have a moment? Yes. Once on today's "Afternoon Japan" the content of the 2nd letter will be partially published, the confusion will grow even bigger. Yes. "Persons who deserved to die". They heard it but didn't grasp its meaning. I'm sure they will dig down to the very roots of the victims' history and then make a fuss that there was nothing. Inukai-san, do you already know what this statement means? The points these 2 person have in common are those postoperative scars you detected and their medical history. They have both been hospitalized because of disease of an internal organ. Yes. Yumika was always in hospital because of her hepatitis. But you said, "Just when she could live a normal life again." Was she cured of her illness? Yes. She was blessed with a good doctor and received a liver transplant. Transplant, you say? - Yes? - This is Kotegawa. It's enough to try calling me one time. I'll call you back, then. It was as you said. Hanzaki Kiriko-san suffered from a lung disease and was hospitalized for a long time. Didn't she receive a transplant? Why do you know? You're right, about mid-May last year. What was the exact date? Wait a moment please. It was the 16th of May. The same day Rokugo Yumika underwent organ transplantation. They were both operated on the same day? Is there such a coincidence? It's not a coincidence. - I'm very sorry about last time. - No. If you come because of Sayaka-chan, at this time... No. Today I'm here for professional reasons. Can we talk with you for a moment? We're very sorry that it's so suddenly, but have you heard of the Jack the Ripper case that's causing such a turmoil presently? A terrible incident, isn't it? Actually, we learned that the victims Rokugo Yumika-san and Hanzaki Kiriko-san underwent organ transplantation on the same day. But I had nothing to do with them. Right. We talked with the recipient coordinators who were in charge of them, but the donor who provided the organs for Rokugo Yumika-san and Hanzaki Kiriko-san was one and the same person. And the coordinator in charge of this donor, Takano-san, that was you. Could you give us informations about this donor? I can't do that. What do you want to do with informations about the donor? Do you think the person of the donor has anything to do with this case? To take all possibilities into account is our job, isn't it? There's the principle of medical confidentiality regarding our patients. Due to this principle, we cannot communicate patient data to anyone. This is the investigation of a murder case! It's not the situation to say such things. - What about the others? - Pardon? There are more patients who received an organ from this donor, right? - You are well informed, aren't you? - Well, I've done a little research. Indeed, besides Rokugo-san and Hanzaki-san there are persons who received an organ from the same donor. "Persons", that means there are at least 2 more persons, right? Jack has announced further crimes. Kotegawa! I'm begging you, give us the data of these persons please. I know nothing about them. There's a possibility that Jack is after patients who received a transplant from the same donor as Rokugo-san and Hanzaki-san! Takano-san! Transplantation is like a donation of life. There's a person who donates this life, of course, but the feelings of those who have no choice but to receive it, have you ever thought about them? Even after the operation is over, there are members of the family of the donor who wonder if this was really alright. Even among the organ recipients some wonder if it's right to take another person's organ in order to live. If we disclosed informations so easily, they would know each others identity and it could come to conflicts that should be avoided. And it would also lead to irritations among patients who are willing to become a donor and those who are registered as recipient. This is a delicate issue. Don't you know that, Inukai-san? You said you had done research, didn't you? Or, did you research for your work only? This has nothing to do with our conversation. At any rate, this is all for now. I understand. Then, we'll come back with an official search warrant. Thank you very much. This is certainly not the time to insist on privacy. This isn't the true reason why she didn't tell us. - This woman was lying. - What do you mean? When it slipped your mouth that Jack announced further crimes, she was obviously upset. You think she's somehow involved in the case? "Even after the operation is over, there are members of the family of the donor" "who wonder if this was really alright." That's what she said. I wouldn't be surprised if such a family were interested in the transplanted organs. Then, you mean the family of the donor dissect the bodies in order to get the transplanted organs back? That's the magician's left hand!? - Takano-san! - Yes. My husband... Majikina is calling for you. Understood. It will be because of Sayaka-chan, don't you think? I saw it shortly before. Didn't Inukai-san consult you about Sayaka-chan? Today, it was for professional reasons. It concerned the investigation of a case, this Jack the Ripper case. Then, the man who accompanied Inukai-san... He's a policeman. Why did they come here? I don't know. It seems they wanted to hear the opinion of a medical expert. I see. What's wrong? You look so bad. No, I'm alright. Excuse me. I'm going to Professor Majikina's office. You must not overdo it. If you look so strained in front of Majikina, he will unnecessarily think you're ill. That... Even with me he's a bit too strict sometimes, but, Takano-san, this man really means well with you. Thank you very much. It's Takano from Teito University Hospital. When you hear this, please call me back. It's urgent. Shirou is already dead. What are you saying, Father! Shirou is alive and well. As an organ of another person. There is no person named Kishibo Shirou anymore. Your son, my grandson, isn't in this world anymore. That's not true! I'm not saying we should forget him, but we have to see reality. Your child is dead since a year. It's only painful for you. Shirou is already... Shirou is alive. Still, this boy's kidneys, his heart... The commissioner will appear on "Afternoon Japan", what's that supposed to mean? It's in order to use Kanto Central Television to stir up Jack and bring him to light. He let himself be taken in by the smooth talk of that guy. Since the next crime is announced, the commissioner is also pretty impatient. Well, furthermore, he would want to appeal to the citizens and show that the police are working properly. Is he trying to save his own face again!? Looks like he carefully combed his hair. Good afternoon. Today on "Afternoon Japan", we welcome a special guest. Every day we report about it, the "Heisei Jack the Ripper" serial murder case. (Heisei-era: 1989.01.08 - 2019.05.01) Today, the man who is in charge of this case, the director of Criminal Investigation Division Section 1, Police Commissioner Tsurusaki Koichi-shi is visiting us. - We are delighted to have you here. - Thank you for the invitation. These 2 incidents show extremly bizarre features so the people are afraid to go out at night, right? As an attentive observer you noticed this is an imitation of the "Jack the Ripper" case which happened in 19th century London. But after all, imitation is imitation, and it's barbariously staged. For this reason, there's no need to be so much afraid. That's a deliberate provocation, isn't it? The Metropolitan Police Department is the best police organization in the world. We won't allow any more of these brutal crimes. To all the citizens I promise from today on the nights will be peaceful. Is it good to say such things? If you are in a position to say this, can we assume that you're already in possession of clues to identify the perpetrator? Yes. Even though there is a continuity, we didn't recognize its relevance at first. But, after the 2nd murder we finally saw the connecting element. I've reported on the transplantations. But of course, I've underlined that we don't know yet whether it is of significance for the murders. At the present stage, I can't disclose what this connecting element is. However, if we keep track of this common trait, I'm convinced the case will be solved in the forseeable future. Today, I want to use this opportunity to appeal to the perpetrator. You have a message for Jack? Twice we received a message from the perpetrator. This could be called our response. Are you watching this broadcast, Jack? We know the criterion by which you choose your victims. Therefore we know of course the next person you're after. Your next target is under our protection. It is useless to try. And, no matter how often you pretend to be Jack, it's already clear that indiscriminate murder is not your motive. So let's ask about that, Jack. What is your aim? What is the thing you want? Is it sheer hunger for revenge, or for body parts of your loved ones? If you have something to say, I will listen. It doesn't matter if by phone or by mail. However, never again will I let you commit a crime. Just wait, Jack. Soon, the rope will be around your neck! Sorry, I can't bear to watch this. That's only natural. Completely full of himself, isn't he? Like a student theatre play. Does he believe the perpetrator is so afraid now that he won't do it again? It could have the adverse effect just as well. - Inukai! Kotegawa! - Yes. Bring Takano Chiharu here. The top of Criminal Investigation Division has made a public declaration. We can't allow her to fob us off any longer. Can we wait for her to appear in person and give us the informations? Let's put her under pressure and make her spit out what she knows! Being the victim of idiotic decisions of the higher-ups goes against the grain, doesn't it? If Jack gets arrested now, in one shot Commissioner Tsurusaki is a star. If the solution takes more time, the ones who get blamed for delivering incorrect informations are us. - That's... - Wrong! If the solution takes more time, there will be more corpses. - Yes? - Kishibo-san! Where are you right now? Kishibo-san! My son... I'm going to see Shirou. Kishibo-san, Shirou-san is already... No! He was alive and well inside of Rokugo-san and Hanzaki-san. Just like you said. Apart from that, can everyone say Shirou is dead just because his brain is dead? I've done some researching. The inner organs have a memory too, right? A transplanted organ keeps the memories of its former owner, even though there may be some changes due to eating habits. But even then, can you say that Shirou is dead? This boy is still alive. I'm on the way to see him. Kishibo-san! Hello. Are you here for a visit? No. Is coordinator Takano-san here? It seems she felt ill and went home early. The Hell! It's absolutely not what was to be expected. In the next race, I will surely get it right. Help! Help me! What have I done to you? No! Someone help me! Help! Help! Just one night after the commissioner's declaration of war. Seems this is Jack's reply. Thanks for your hard work. The victim Gushiken Satoru-san also received a kidney transplantation this spring. - From the same donor? - Presumably. It's as you suspected, huh? Cause for celebration! - Thanks for your hard work. - How is it? Nothing to mention in particular. The same as the previous 2 cases. Where's Tsurusaki-san? The commissioner will probably not appear on the crime scene. Then, tell him when you return. If he has time to give himself airs on TV, - he should try to show the tranquility of Buddha. - I'll tell him. - So, what's the perpetrator's objective? - We don't know yet. But Jack targets patients who were organ recipients, right? - We're quite sure about that. - I see. Well, this will raise another troublesome problem again, won't it? - What do you mean? - The organ transplant law has been enacted and people think that transplantations have become common, but that's a big lie. There's still a mountain of subtle issues. Catch the perpetrator as quickly as possible. Understood. It seems a clerk at the auto race course observed the victim. After the final race was over, I think it was at 5:00 pm, I saw that Gushiken-san was approached by a woman. - What were they talking about? - I couldn't say that. But, when Gushiken-san headed towards the exit in a bad mood, this woman followed him. This woman... was it this person? Yes, that's the woman. Yes. There's a 3rd letter from Jack. Every day we report on it. From the person who appears to be the perpetrator in the "Heisei Jack the Ripper" serial murder case a 3rd letter arrived at Kanto Central Television. This is the 3rd letter we received from Jack. "Organ transplantation is a shift of life." "The original fate of the 3 persons I slaughtered was to die." "All I did was to restore it." "Jack" Inukai-san... The investigation revealed that what all the 3 victims so far have in common is an organ transplantation one year ago. This might lead to the conclusion that Jack the Ripper has a negative opinion on organ transplantation. Sakashita-san, what do you think? To begin with, for an organ transplantation to take place the brain has to be declared dead and the donor must have given consent. This last so-called confession of Jack makes us think about the brain death problem again which is quite a delicate problem, isn't it? Could this have been Jack's true intention? It remains to be hoped that the case will be solved quickly in the next days. Yes. It's Takano. I can't believe that Gushiken-san also fell victim to this. We were just on the way because we wanted to talk with you. Yesterday, you met Gushiken-san at the auto race course, didn't you? - Yes. - What did you talk about? About Jack the Ripper and the 2 women who were attacked, and that he might be the 3rd victim. - What did he say? - He said it was humbug. Where did you separate from him? Near the exit. If I had talked longer with him at that time, if I had followed him, this thing... After that, between 6:00 pm and 8:00 pm, where have you been? I took the train and returned home right away. If you check the records of my IC-card, I think you will see. Did he also receive his organ from the same donor as Rokugo Yumika-san and Hanzaki Kiriko-san? Yes. These 3 persons were not the only recipients, right? There's one more person who received the heart of this donor. Can you give us the contact information of this person? And, the name of the donor's family too. Takano-san, you called us because you had made up your mind to tell us everything, right? Your profession is to save and preserve life. If you keep silent, yet another life could be lost. Who is it you're covering for? The family of the donor? Or else... No. The one I'm covering for is myself. Yourself? I've violated the rules for coordinators and was afraid it would come to light. What's that supposed to mean? You illegally gathered information about the identity of the recipients and passed it on to the family of the donor. The name of the donor is Kishibo Shirou-san. His only family is his mother. Ryoko-san is her name. Why did you tell her the identity of the recipients? Kishibo Shirou-san had a traffic accident. Only his head was damaged, the rest of the body was uninjured. Your son carried an organ donor card. This card is a declaration of intention to donate his organs. Such a thing... No! Because my son isn't dead yet! He's making such a peaceful face. Couldn't he just be sleeping? Your son is brain-dead. This boy is alive. I will take care of Shirou's body. I've raised him. He's all what remains for me from my husband. Her husband had already died and Shirou-san was Ryoko-san's only family. You, do you have a child? If just because there is such a card your child became a part of the body of other persons, would you rejoice from the bottom of your heart, then? 2 years ago, my 4 years old daughter died in an accident. We were taking a walk and when I looked away for a moment, she jumped on the road. Midori! My husband blamed me for the death of our daughter and divorced me. I had lost everything. I immersed myself in my work to fill the gap and somehow managed to forget it all. But, Ryoko-san's eyes and words at that moment reminded me of my daughter again. It's true, Shirou-san's body is still alive. However, as it is now, Shirou-san's body will also die in the end. Alright. Shirou's organs, use them please. - Thank you very much. - However, there's a condition. The persons who receive Shirou's organs, tell me their identity please. Kishibo-san, that's a little... As it is now, Shirou's body will die. But, if he's transplanted, Shirou will live on for a long time. So it is, isn't it? I... can never again take that boy into my arms. I can never again feel the warmth of that kid. But, at least, I want to watch over Shirou's future life. That's problematic, Kishibo-san. I won't contact anyone of them. I only want to watch over them. I'm begging you, Takano-san. I have no other reason for living anymore. Say! If you were a mother, you would understand my feelings, wouldn't you? Please! I'm begging you! Please! I understood Kishibo-san's feelings just too well. Never again can you take your child in your arms. Never again that soft smell when you hug them, and never again can you feel that warm beating of their heart. Even though you love them still so much... And so, you told Kishibo-san the identity of the recipients. Yes. - Did you stay in touch with Kishibo-san? - Yes. But, since a short time I cannot contact her. The last time we got in touch, she said she was going to see her son. Takano-san, the identity of the last remaining recipient, could you tell it to us? The suspect is Kishibo Ryoko, 50 years old. We believe she's trying to target Mitamura Keisuke, living in Koto Ward. All available police forces in the vicinity are ordered to protect Mitamura Keisuke and arrest the suspect! Do your best at the training today. The coach said he would teach us a new exercise at the horizontal bar. Your father was also good at the horizontal bar, wasn't he? - I'll do my best. Bye. - Have a nice day. Be careful, okay! Very soon I will see you. Good day. We are police officers. You are Mitamura Keisuke-kun, right? - Yes. - Would you cooperate with us? Inukai-san! I just got a call from the hospital. Sayaka-chan... What is going on? Jack the Ripper seems to be the cause. Due to that incident, on TV and in the newspapers more and more people say negative things about transplant surgery. Sayaka-san heard this and said she wouldn't want to receive a transplant. You don't want the operation? I know there are different opinions on transplantation. But, what has this to do with you? Who has the right to live with another person's organs! People have a natural right to fight for their life. A guy who gives up this right is only a coward. Don't tell me things I already know! That's so typical of you! You're just running away. If we receive an organ from another person, we have the responsibility to live on. This is scary. People, no matter what kind of guy they are, have the responsibility to live as long as they can. But, among them are some guys who try to run away. What such guys choose is usually the easy way. However, the easy way is only for guys without power. Because they constantly choose the easy way, sooner or later they lose the power to fight. And since it's so easy, they get into the habit of lying and defrauding people. I've seen a lot of such guys. Do you want to say I'm the same as a criminal? Don't run away, Sayaka. Get out! You don't know anything! Then, explain it to me! If I don't know anything, then explain it to me! Don't think I want to run away. But it makes no sense if I'm going to die. I'm scared. Jack kills patients who received a transplant. So if I get the transplant, I'll also... As father, there may be nothing I could do for you. But as policeman, there's still something I can do. It will be alright. Don't worry. I will catch Jack without fail. It's my fault. I... I beg you, don't let Kishibo-san commit any more crimes. Alright. I will end this without fail. Yes? You are Mitamura Keisuke-kun, right? Yes. Excuse me... who are you? There's a reason why I can't tell you my name, but I was involved in your transplant surgery. Do you know what kind of person the original owner of that heart was? No. Don't you want to know the benefactor who gave you your life? I would like to know. Then, I will tell you. However, I can't tell you over the phone. In 1 hour from now, could you spare time? Yes. Then, in 1 hour, in the coffee shop near Kakigahara-station. I'll call you again. A person who seems to be Jack has contacted Keisuke-kun. Kakigahara-station, its periphery, and the roads to the station must be completely monitored! What have you been doing! Sorry. We went to the hospital and my phone was switched off. Yes. Understood. Mitamura Keisuke-kun received a call from a person who seems to be Jack. Jack exploits the mental condition of recipient patients. They are asked if they wanted informations about the donor who gave them their life. There's nobody who wouldn't want to know that. That's Kishibo Ryoko! In Kakigahara-station we detected a person who seems to be Kishibo Ryoko. We'll arrest her. - Search for her! - Yes! Welcome! Take any table you like please. Thanks for your hard work. The time for the appointment has passed, but nothing happened. A moment ago, investigators at the Kakigahara-station rotary detected Kishibo Ryoko, but it seems they let her slip. Jack is a guy with a sharp mind. He will already have grasped what's going on here. Yes. I'm in the station now. - I'm sorry, but can't you come here? - Okay. Jack called Mitamura-kun to Kakigahara-station. At this time, the station is still crowded with people. A brutal crime should be impossible there. We'll set out too. Stay close to Mitamura Keisuke. Once a guy approaches who looks only a little suspicious, arrest them. Yes. When you've arrived at the station, come to the ticket gate. Don't hang up the phone for now. Could it be... I'm almost at the station. Where are you? At the track where the downbound train is standing. Get on it. You must get on at any rate. And, one more thing. Dump the device that connects you to the police at the track. Are you... Jack the Ripper? You must follow the instructions. Your little sister is very cute, isn't she? What did you do to Hinako? It's dangerous to let him run free any longer. Let's protect him. If you follow the instructions, nothing will happen to her. Well, if you don't hurry, the train will be gone. Sorry. Shit! Inukai-san! Keisuke-kun is on the train. - Is anyone of you on board? - No, we missed it. How's the situation? What are you doing? I told you, didn't I! A delay of 1 second only, and our prestige will be shattered! We... are hunting a criminal for the victims who lost their life in a brutal way! Not for you, and not for the police! Don't worry. We'll catch her for sure. No one will get hurt anymore. So please relax and have a little snack with me here in the office. I hate sweets. I'm counting on you, Inukai. What's with the police? I've shaken them off. At the end of the tunnel, turn right. I didn't hear your answer. Because I'm scared! Has your heart begun to beat faster? Then you should be happy. It's proof that the transplanted heart has become a part of you. I'm here. At last, let me tell you the donor of your heart is a young man named Kishibo Shirou. He wanted to become a gymnast. Well then, there's no need to use the phone anymore. You are Jack!? Give me that heart. Freeze! Don't try to resist please! You are Jack the Ripper, right? Majikina-sensei. It's only you, right? Yes. I asked for that. Did you tell Mitamura-kun about his sister? I told him that we escorted her safely home from cram school. And that you had not abducted her or something like that. On the scalpel you carried with you we found traces of blood. And in your bag too. Whether this blood derives from the 3 victims, Rokugo Yumika-san, Hanzaki Kiriko-san, and Gushiken Satoru-san, is currently being investigated. Well, for you, to dissect a body and remove the organs will take only a few minutes. The coroner said he admired such skills. Thanks for the compliment. However, there are still many things I can't understand. The motive. We found out the donor Kishibo Shirou-san was transported to Teito University Hospital, and the one who removed Kishibo-san's organs there, was you. I remember that young man well. But you had not the slightest idea who the recipients were. In other words, I can't imagine that you had a grudge against all those victims. Moreover, you are a leading person in transplant surgery and a leading promoter of transplantation. So what made a man like you do something that's contrary to all this? The more you probe into a person's mind, the more you get perplexed. It's true, I have promoted transplantation. But, there is no guaranty that such a conviction will never be shaken. That's no answer, Sensei. And, even if it was like that, why had you to kill these 3 people? Finding this out is your job. Right. Speaking of it, how is Keisuke-kun doing since then? I've scared him terribly. On a freshly transplanted heart this might have a bad effect, I'm afraid. Can't you tell his doctor to make a thorough examination? Why are you worried about that? To worry about someone you planned to kill may appear as a contradiction in itself, but a doctor is different, isn't he? No, that's not what I was speaking about. In conjunction with this case I did a little research about organ transplantation. Indeed, there are cases where mental stress does damage to organs. But it practically never leads to quick organ failure. You should know more about this than anyone else. Majikina-sensei, you knew that Mitamura Keisuke-san's heart might fail for other reasons than mental stress, didn't you? And that's the reason why you don't talk about the motive. Because for you it is worse than the stigma of a murderer, it is dishonoring and scary! During the organ removal some mistake happened, right? Majikina-sensei! I won't speak a word. Kishibo Shirou-san's mother, you remember her, don't you? Kishibo Yoko-san. Day by day she went visiting the persons who received her son's organs, almost as if she was visiting her son who was living by himself far away from her now. It made her heart pound, on rainy and on windy days. She kept her promise never to approach the recipients and only watched them from a distance. She trusted that your surgery was perfect. Even if her son's brain was dead, she believed his organs were alive and in excellent condition. This was the hope that kept her alive. Why did you rob the organs which had belonged to Kishibo Shirou-san? Seeing the healthy appearance of the persons who received these organs was his mother's only remaining reason for living. How is his mother doing since then? She still trusts in you, when she goes visiting her son's heart. I see. Well, it was as you said. When I extracted Kishibo Shirou-kun's organs, an irreparable mistake happened. An irreparable mistake? On that day, I wasn't feeling well since the morning. Coughing and fever. Even bloody sputum. But, I thought I couldn't leave important transplant surgery to someone else. So I performed the operation. Later, my coughing turned out to be tuberculosis. Tuberculosis is transmitted through the air. There was reason to fear that Shirou-kun's organs had been infected with tuberculosis. What would happen if they were infected? If an organ that's infected with tuberculosis is transplanted, the recipient later on could develop tuberculosis. Before that happened, I had to retrieve these organs. Had anyone of the recipients been infected and it became clear that the transplanted organ was the cause, all the reputation and fame I had acquired would be destroyed. I... was afraid of that. Inukai-san, please tell Kishibo-san she generously offered her son's organs, but I wasn't able to make good use of them. I'm really very sorry. Is it true? Professor Majikina? He has confessed. I can't believe the professor took the life of a human. It is as you say. - It's not over yet. - What do you mean? Majikina-sensei also has the right hand of a magician. He is lying. Lying? When Majikina-sensei approached Mitamura Keisuke-kun, why did he draw the scalpel from the beginning? Until then, the murder had been done by strangling and the scalpel only been used after that. That's right. - Moreover, he was wearing a suit at that time. - Right. You are literally bathed in blood if you dissect a body, but he had nothing with him to protect himself. He had not the intention to kill Keisuke-kun. He had the intention to get caught from the beginning? He intentionally made Keisuke-kun parade on the streets so we would find him. Why should the professor do such a thing? Then, the real Jack... It's someone who's used to handle a scalpel, who's so close to Majikina-sensei that he could easily find the murderous scalpel and the rope, and above all, someone he wants to protect even if he has to sacrifice himself. [ Patient data: Kishibo Shirou ] Jack the Ripper was you, right? Majikina Yoko-san! What are you saying! Majikina-sensei has the intention to take the blame for all your crimes. He recognized that you are Jack only recently. Probably, he found the scalpel and the rope among your belongings. Thereupon, he approached Mitamura Keisuke-san before you would do it. In order to prevent you from committing a further crime, he would take this crime upon his own shoulders. Why... Why should I have killed these recipients? For which reason did you access the drug management database? We've already got us a copy. For that day, the day when Kishibo Shirou-san was declared brain-dead, it shows clearly which medication you used. During the organ extraction the donor is treated with a muscle relaxant too. When we checked it, 1 ampule of a muscle relaxant under development in the laboratory was gone. The one who made the medication mistake was you, right? On that day, in a special room I tested a new muscle relaxant for organ toxicity. The preparation I was using at that time was accidentially given to Kishibo Shirou-san. If the mistake had come to light, my husband had lost his reputation due to my fault. Above all, I... was afraid of... my husband's reprimands. This man wouldn't forgive me a mistake. So in order to hide the evidence, the recipients... And yet... For a person like me, this man, far from being angry, took the blame. Your crime wasn't only to take the life of 3 people. By borrowing the name "Jack the Ripper" and using it to hide a problem with organ transplantation, you caused fear in people who were waiting for their life to begin. And that's not all. The dignity of those people who made the difficult decision to donate this life was hurt as well. You... The feelings of those people, their love, you trampled them underfoot. Aso-san called you a man who had rid himself of his emotions, but he's wrong, isn't he? On the first investigation meeting I noticed that Commissioner Tsurusaki's words were annoying to you. The reputation of the police depends on the quickest possible arrest of the perpetrator. A delay of 1 day... no, a delay of 1 second only, and our prestige will be shattered! Understood? To utter no word of regret about the victim was unexcusable, wasn't it? In that moment, I felt it. "Inukai-san is kinder than anyone else", I thought. "He's just not good at expressing it." As I told you already, I grew up in an orphanage. All my live I've hungered for love. That's why I know. If there is only a little love, the other side senses it without fail. That's why I'm sure your feelings have reached your daughter too. Oh, I'm sorry. Continue please. Excuse me... I was taking a walk in the proximity when I heard the beautiful sound of a trumpet so I came to listen a little. You're good at playing it, aren't you? No, I've still much to learn. And my vitality is not back to normal yet. "Not back to normal yet", you say? Actually, the lungs are my own, but the heart that's powering them was transplanted from another person. Inside of your body there might be a fight. No, I wouldn't say "fight". It rather feels as if they were still keeping an eye on each other. Anyway, it's a strong heart. Someone told me its former owner aimed to become a gymnast. I think that's the reason. No matter what mischief other parts of my body may make, as long as this heart keeps beating, I'm alright, I think. Sometimes I have the feeling that I get orders from this heart. "Take a deeper breath!" "Try more to blow with full power!", it says. Excuse me... It's an intrusive request, but if you don't mind, would you allow me to listen to the beat of that heart? Okay. You're alive, aren't you? That's good, isn't it? I'm so glad. Thank you very much for what you have done. Sayaka told me, "I'll do my best." I'm glad! I've formerly decided more than a husband or a father I wanted to be a policeman in the first place. But I still wonder if that was really a good decision. Perhaps I will never know. There was never anything I could do as father for Sayaka. Will there ever be such a thing? That doesn't matter. Just take the precious person before your eyes in your arms please. Let her feel your warmth please. In order to see that smile even in 10 or 20 years from now and to connect one precious person to the other precious person it takes love. Connect...
