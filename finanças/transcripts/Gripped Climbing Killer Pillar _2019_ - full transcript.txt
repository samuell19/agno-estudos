Whoo. This is crazy! This is amazing. Where do we begin? I don't know. All this stuff looks so steep. Hey. How about that one? Nice little warm-up spot? - Is that? - Yeah. Nice. Come on, girl. Whoo. Got you right here. You're all right. Here we go. - Whoo. - You got this. You may wanna move the pad over. Thanks, I got it. Oh. Oh. - You good? - Yeah. - Thanks for the spot. Oh. - You're welcome. - You all right? - Yeah. The idea is to get your foot to stick to the rock. - Cute. - It's our first time coming outside, so... - Really? - Yeah. It's a long way from the climbing gym. Oh, wow, yeah. The view's a lot better, isn't it? Yeah, when you live in a city, you gotta make do with what you got. No, gyms, I mean, gyms are great. They, they get you strong, but... now you're outside, you gotta learn how to climb for real. Funny. Well, climb safe, ladies. Not bad, right? Yeah. If you like blond girls. Well, maybe I like blond girls. - Please. No. Not a chance. Not a chance. - Hmm? Hmm? Oh, man. This is party central. - Oh, yeah. - He's got a bigger wingspan. - He's got like a plus four. - You gotta check this out. So, where are you guys from? - LA. - No, really. Yeah. First time, actually. Get your beer open. It's a bottle opener. - Hey, thanks again for that spot today. - You're welcome. - Here we go. - Who's your friend and who's her friend? - Hey, Brett. How's it going? - Hi, Catrina. It's going good. How are you? - So what did you climb today? - Uh, today was kind of more of a rest day for me. Oh, my God. - Why is he coming towards us? - Oh, my gosh. I don't know. I don't know what's happening. - Hi. - Hello. Hey, you wouldn't have a spare avocado, would you? - No. Sorry. - Yes, we do. - Here. - Thanks. - You're welcome. - Hey, we're having a little potluck over in Site 42 if you wanna stop by. I could probably get you on the list. Where is Site 42? It's over there. It's Brett's camp. - I think we're good. - Well, no, actually, I think that sounds like a lot of fun. - And that's why we're good. 'Cause we'll be there. - Great. Domo avocado, Mr. Roboto. What? Brett's the guy we met at the boulders today, remember? He's cute. So is he. I'm not here to meet guys. Now, you're the one that said we needed to try new things, so... - "Domo avocado, Mr. Roboto." That's not funny. - That was funny. - Steve! - What's up, Brett? - How are you doing? Good to see you. - What's up? How are you? Good to be seen. What'd you get into today? It's not so bad. - Hey, you guys. - Hey, you made it. - Yeah, thanks for having us. - Of course. - Um, I didn't catch your names earlier. I'm Jeremy. - Oh, this is Jade and I'm Rose. Hi, Jade. That's how we do that. Yeah, hey. Hey, these two are camping next to Jackie's site. Jackie Blackstone. She's like a climber legend. Big wall first ascents in the valley. - The Yosemite Valley? - Yeah. - First woman to solo the nodes. - Good Lord. You mean without any ropes? No, not free solo. Solo climb with gear. - So, she slept on the wall? - Yeah. You should try it sometime. It's amazing. Huh? What do you think? What do you think, Jade? - Something to drink? - Yes, please. How about some drinks, huh? Beers? ROSE: Yes, please. Thank you. - Hi. - Hi. Uh, we met earlier today at the boulders. Yeah, I remember. I'm Rose, by the way. - Brett. - It's nice to meet you, Brett. Nice to meet you, Rose. I'll be right back. Okay. - Hey. - Thank you. - To the good life. - To the good life. To the good life. - Oh, Jesus. - Sorry. Oh, my God. - Hi. - Do you wanna come inside? - Is it your place? - Yeah. "House of Dreams," huh? - Very good. Let me get the light. - Thank you. Watch your step. - This is so cute. - Yeah. Not too shabby. Welcome. Oh, my God. Is this you? Uh, no. It's one of my favorite photos. But did you see what I mean about gym climbing, right? It's just practice for this big rock. Yeah, but this is just something I don't understand. I don't know, it's like... It's like you have a death wish or something. Oh, um, climbers actually have a life wish. If we wanted to die, we'd just let go. Well, okay, I get that, but... Why put yourself in that kind of danger to begin with? For the bliss. You know, when you're up there, nothing else can come in your mind. It's total focus. More real than real. - "More real than real"? - More real than real. Can you explain that a little bit better for me, please? Um, when you're on a 1,000-foot face, there is nothing like it in the world. It's total freedom. Yeah. Freedom to plummet straight on down to your death. Okay. I see we got some work to do. - Close your eyes. Close 'em. - Why? Trust me. Okay. Take a deep breath. Now, imagine you're on that 1,000-foot cliff. Look around you. You see ravens soaring below you. You're clinging to the rock like a lizard. You feel the quiet of the desert. Rising, filling you up. Making you feel lighter. You're aware of every muscle... every nerve... tendon, bone in your body. And in your spirit... it makes you feel like you're flying. - I'm sorry. I... - Um... - Got carried away. - Yeah. Me too. - Oh, hi. - Hi. Tell me what's happening over here. This looks intense. That's an alpine route. - An alpine route? - Yeah. Well, I think I might wanna try an alpine route. You've come to the right place. Wanna climb tomorrow? Yeah. I wanna fly. 'Sup, girl? Let's go. Well, see you manana. Jade. Hey. Hey, don't forget we're gonna go bouldering tomorrow, so... Yeah. Yeah. Great. - Maybe. Maybe... - Maybe not. Uh, someone made a friend today. I can't believe you ditched me like that. Oh, come on. We are not in high school anymore. - I like these people. - Rock brats? Well, maybe I like rock brats. Hi! You coming in? I'm sorry. I was just looking around. At nature. You want some coffee? I'm good. Thank you, though. Um... Actually, that sounds really nice. All right. - Coffee. - Mmm. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hey, that's pretty good. - It's my secret recipe. What's the secret? Uh, I couldn't tell you that. I'd have to kill you if I did, it's classified. Well, you see, actually, I have level 10 security clearance, so I sort of outrank you. Madame X, I should have known, sorry. Uh, it's sage. Sage? Like sage brush? Yeah, it's growing all around the campsite. You put sage brush in your coffee? Well, it's a herb. A sacred herb. I use it for a lot of things. - Like what? - I'll show you. See, smells good. Apply generously. Oh, come on. Is that what I'm drinking right now? No, obviously not sage that was in my armpits. Um, I cook with it. A lot. And it's, if you're in a pinch, it's really good for wiping your... Oh, God, Brett. Seriously? Come on. I'm done. I'm done with the personal hygiene classes. Please, thank you. Done with class. I thought we were going climbing anyway. Yes. Um, I'll come back and pick you up in five minutes. Okay. Hey. - Where are you going? - Morning. Going climbing with Brett. - You're ditching me again? - No. He's just taking me on a route. A what? A route, like a multi-pitch climb. Ugh. Don't leave me with that Jeremy guy again, please. You're gonna be fine, darling. Besides, I really wanna try this, okay? - Morning, Jeremy. - Hi. Have fun. I will. Still wanna go bouldering? - You got beer? - We always have beer. - You ever used a GRIGRI? - Um, sorry. - It's easy. I'm on top. - Okay. Just like any other device. Brake hands on the bottom. If I fall, you catch me. - Simple. - Wait, no, no. But how do I do that? It's auto-locking, so just lean back. Okay. Good luck. Okay, you're on belay. - Okay. Climbing. - Climb on. Nice, Rose. Ah. Come on, Rose. Don't stop now. - My foot is stuck, Brett. - Just pull it out. What... - What do you think I'm trying to do? - Yank it straight back. Ah, you got it. Nice. Keep coming. Ah. My hand feels like it's gonna slip. Chalk it up. It's kind of wedged in a wall right now. Crank it in there and then step up. Okay. Nice. Really nice. This does not feel good. Nice. Let me take it. - Thank you. - Give you a break. Yeah. Oh. Your hands, you're starting to look like a real crack climber. - Everything hurts. - Yeah. How high are we? Oh, about 300 feet. - This is crazy. - Definitely. - You're crazy - Now, you're up. What do you mean? - It's your turn. - For what? To take the lead. - You want me to lead? - Ha, ha. You'll love it. It's a... Five 8 bolts. You know, try the shortcut. It's totally within your score. - I have never led outside before. - But, oh, you gotta try it. - No. - You'll love it. Try it. - Why are you telling me? - Come on. - Be adventurous. Okay? All right. - Okay, okay, okay. Why do I let you convince me to do these things? Well, what do I do? Just climb up left, and all the way at the top of the pitch, there's anchors. Just clip in. - All right. You got me? - I got you. Nice. Easy. Look at that. Nice. Nice. - Yeah. - I don't like it. Clip that and you're as safe as you can be. - Nice, Rose. Whoa. - All right. - There's nothing up here, Brett. - Just stay on the arete. You got it. I don't... I don't like it, Brett. - What? - Can I come down? - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Let me know when. I'm on it. - Okay, yeah. - All right, lowering. - Okay. Oh, God. Oh. God, that sucks. It's not like a bouldering problem. You can't just jump down from 300 feet. - God, everything changes when the rope is below you. - True. There you go. All right, you're on belay. Tension. Slap me in the fucking face. Oh. Oh, shit. Oh. Nice. Up rope. There's a good hold right above... Yeah, right there. - Yeah. It holds all the way. - Jesus. - Yeah. - Would you pay attention, Brett, please? That tension, you kept slapping me in the face. Well, one minute, you want tension and next minute, you want slack. - I need you to keep it tight. - I was keeping it tight. - What if I fell? - I would have caught you. - When? When I hit the fucking ground? - Your anchor. - Don't be ridiculous. - Me, ridiculous? Are you kidding me right now? You're the ridiculous one. - Oh, yeah? - Seriously. What the fuck is going on here? - And you're just standing there. - Yeah, I'm just standing here. Yeah, just standing there, hanging off a cliff, looking at me with that stupid smirk on your face, that's... Shit... - Oh, my God. Don't do that. - I got you. Come here and sit. - Are you kidding me? - All in the rope. You're a real climber now. I love it up here! How do we get down? Oh! That's so great. Good job. - Yeah. Yeah. - Grab my bag? You got it? Thank you. - There you go. - There are gentlemen left in the world. Thank you. Oh, ouch. - You want some water? - Yes, that'd be great. Would you listen to these names? Crack of Doom, Cliffs of Insanity, Wet Denim Daydream, Stoner's Highway. Of course. Who in the world comes up with these names? The first person that ascends it gets to name it. Climbers are very melodramatic. Uh-huh. You don't say. Oh, this is it. This is what I wanna do tomorrow. Killer Pillar. I was thinking about it. What? I'm not afraid. Come on. You're my rope gun. Look, Killer Pillar, it's the real deal. It's not just a couple pitches. It's a commitment. - It's a Grade V. - Okay, well... I did good out there today. You said so yourself. You were doing great, but this is a whole other level of shredding. Oh, it's a whole other level of shredding. God, I love these technical rock-climbing terms. Hey, look. If you don't wanna go, then just say something, - and I'll find somebody else to climb with. - Wow. - Ouch. You fight dirty. - Whatever it takes. - Please? - All right. If... If I were to say yes, and that's a big if, you would have to be ready for some serious suffering. And I, I really wanna make that clear. I mean, I think I can handle it 'cause I have been hanging out with you all day. Oh! Stop! What are you gonna do with that water? I'm thirsty. I was gonna have some water. Oh. Don't! Don't do that. Stop! Don't! - "Don't drink some more water." - No! No! Stop! - Hey. - Hello. - Still making barbecue? - Uh, no, not yet. But I'll get on it. - Do you wanna come have some food with us tonight? - Yeah, sure. I'll make a salad. Great, bring a salad. - Bring your friend Jade. - Oh. - Oh, I'll do it. - I mean, it doesn't... I didn't. - Whatever. - Okay. Hey. You're, you're Jackie, right? - And you are? - I'm Rose, I'm your neighbor. - Do you mind if I ask a question? - Go ahead. How do you do it? Do what? Sorry, um, how do you lead climb? Just practice. That's all it takes. Yeah, but, I mean, can you... Can you tell me about it? You just gotta get out of your head. Well, that's not the first time I've heard that. When you're climbing, especially leading, you have to trust your body. It's a lot more reliable than your mind. And if you can start trusting, that's when you can step into your real power. Easier said than done. - Right? - Let's try something. - Hold out your arm. - Okay. - I'm gonna ask you some questions. - Okay. But don't answer out loud, okay? Are you in Lone Pine? Do you like climbing? Are you a happy person? - Mmm. - What does that mean? That means that your body knows you a whole lot better than you think you do. It'll make a lot more sense once you've been out there. So, where are you climbing tomorrow? I think we're going to do Killer Pillar. I wanna get on that route. - I think it's called Southwest Buttress? - That's a really sporty route. - Who're you climbing that with? - Oh, my friend, Brett. - Just a guy. - Is he familiar with long routes like that? Oh, yeah, yeah. I mean, he says he knows what he's doing, so... - Don't they all? - Yeah. - He's amazing, actually. - Yeah? Really? I had a lot of fun, actually. Whatever I can do for you. - Hey, hi. - Hey. Thanks for coming. You brought lettuce. - You'll want it later. Trust me. - Okay. Great. Thanks. - How's it going? - It's going. - You had fun today? - I had a really good time today. - Good. - It's like, everyone comes from everywhere. All over the world. Lone Pine is a central hub for the climbing community. And they all just come here to hang out? Hang out and climb. Doesn't anybody work? Why? - I mean, right? - Sorry, yeah, yeah. It does make sense. Ladies and gentlemen, Jackie Blackstone is in the house. Jackie Blackstone is here. Are you seeing this? Jackie Blackstone is here. Give it up. - Whoo. - First ascent in the Valley. - Oh, Jesus. - Oh, God. It's happening. - It's happening! - It's going down. ♪ I flow 5.10 in a moment of Zen ♪ Been pulling down the rocks since way back when ♪ When you say Muddy Valley where it all began ♪ With your royal robins ♪ They call me Blackstone ♪ Big wall slayer watch me take this to another layer ♪ I blow the gate roof on a single prayer ♪ Point-5 aliens and brass nuts ♪ I'll see you later ♪ Oh! Yeah! He did it! - What? - What happened? What happened? - Very pretty. - Thank you, Jackie. It's for you. It's for you. - What? - Hmm. What? Amazing night there. I don't know. It doesn't even look real. What do you mean? Looks like the planetarium. You definitely need to get outside more. Maybe. Mmm, check it out. It's starlight. It's where we all come from. It's everything. We're all just... stardust. Hmm. Well, when I was a kid, my dad loved to point out the fact that by the time the light from one of those stars reached us on Earth, the star was already dead. He told you that as a kid? Yeah. That's when he was in a good mood. How do you feel right now? - Right now? - Mmm-hmm. I don't know. Kind of nice. - Ouch, ouch. - Okay, here. Yeah. Slow. Wasn't that nice? - Hey, Brett. - Hi! What'd you climb today, Pine Creek? Yes, that's... - That's what we climbed today. - What we climbed, yeah. Hey, Lee, how do you like being Brett's new belay slave? - Wow. - Jesus. Hey, Catrina. I think somebody's looking for you over here. Well, let me guess. You climbed Crack-a-Go-Go, right? Yeah, I bet you really liked that third pitch. Yeah. Yeah, it was fine. I bet it was. - Jeremy, can you get her out of here, please? - Yeah. Sorry, man. Hey, I thought we talked about this. Huh? Come on, are you about done? Okay. Are these all yours? Hey. Hey, where are you going? I'm tired. Long climb tomorrow. Oh, Catrina. She drinks and she can't stop... Come on, Brett. Just don't do that. Don't treat me like I'm an idiot, because I get it. Get what? That I've climbed with a woman before? Oh, God. Forget it. At least now I know my job. Belay slave. Oh, come on, Rose. You're being ridiculous. - Rose. - I'm being... Brett, this is just happening too fast for me, okay? What is? - Everything! All of this. - What? I am not used to camping or to looking up at all of these stars or being dragged up an 800-foot cliff. And I'm certainly not used to the way you keep looking at me. How do I keep looking? - I don't know, Brett. I don't know. - Tell me. Like you care. I do care. Could you please not say that if you don't mean it? I mean it. I'm going to bed. Rose, you awake? Mmm. No. Do you still wanna go climb? - Yes. - Okay. Well, I got all the gear ready in the car, so... You just need to get up. I'm up. I'm awake. It's barely even light outside. It's gonna be in 45 minutes. And it's in an hour approach to the Pillar. What? Ah! - You good from here, or... - Yeah, I'm good. - Boom. - Dang. Door-to-door. - What's going on there? - Oh. - Brett. - Hey, what's up? - Jade. - What's up? Hey. - 5:00 a.m. We're going climbing. - We just got done drinking. You just got done drinking? - All night long. - We ran out of beers, so... So then the game's over. Well, we... We won. I'm going to bed. Are you guys not still drunk? - Good night, Jade. - Good night. Okay, have fun. - Oh. - Be well. Oh! Oh, Dad, I'm doing it. That's what a thousand feet looks like. You ready for this? Um, how many pitches is it again? A lot. Descriptive, thank you. And it says the route starts left of the trees. So that's right here. What is this? Uh, it's a topo. It's like a map of the climb. So there's no actual guidebook? No, I have one, but a topo is way easier to carry than a whole book. What the hell does any of this even mean? Well, that is a crack climb, and this is a left-facing corner. Um, that's a chimney, bolts. You don't know what any of that means? - Sounds amazing. - Okay. - Here you go, sir. - Thank you. You have the harnesses, right? Oh. Yes, I do. Oh, good. - Ready? - Yep. Watch me. Mmm-hmm. I'm climbing. Climb along, baby. - Is that you? - That's me. Okay. All right, you're on belay, Rose. I'm climbing. Climb on. Rose, reach left there. There's really good holds above you, bombers. I can't reach it. Yes, you can. Draw your foot up to that lip, and then crank up. Right next to your left foot, there's another great... Just let me climb? You all right? Yeah. Jesus. Oh. Okay. That's harder than it looks. Phew. Oh, what, so you're not talking to me now? This is my punishment for disobeying you? Look, Brett, I appreciate the help. I do. But how can I learn if you're feeding me every move? - You were floundering. - I was what? You were having a hard time. I was not. This is a hard rock. I'm still learning. Exactly. That's why I pointed out a hold to you. Okay, well, sometimes I need to figure it out for myself. Yeah, and you did, all right? You're doing good, Rose. Just... Thank you. Was that so hard? Are we cool now? Yes. What's next? We're going up there next, and that is called a chimney. And it's fun. How do you climb it? It's kind of like making your body into a human wedgie. Well, that sounds awkward. You're pretty when you smile. Nah. That's a good word for it, though. Awkward. All right. On belay. - Put me on. - Okay. Nice. - Come on. - Climbing. Come on. Hold that. Nice work. Reach up, yeah. Find a good grab, good crack. All right. Can you go higher? Does it look like it? How am I supposed to get in a chimney with this thing? Use your back. Press your hands against the wall. Oh, my God. Okay. Don't look down. Come on. Yeah. Push against the wall, smashing your back in the other wall, and just up, up. There you go. How's that left hand feel? Not good. Look for a little cracks with the inside of your right foot. Stand up on your right foot. Keep smearing. I can't climb with this backpack. Yes, you can. You're doing it right now. Keep climbing. Good. Wedge your body in the chimney. Use opposing force with your hands. Press your back up against it. Good. Top rope. Argh. Whoa. Okay. Okay, okay. Is there room up here? - Yeah. - Phew. This thing, put it back in the... Yeah. - Oh. - There we go. I hate this backpack so much. You got a little banged up. You're starting to look like a real climber. - Oh, yeah? - How'd you like the chimney? It was pretty fun. Yeah, it's pretty fun. Even with the backpack. Okay, I'm safe! Ah, what? All right, you're on belay, Rose. Climbing. Climb on. Well, this next move's the pendulum pitch. Pendulum? Yeah, it's a swinging across move. Once you commit, there's no turning back. So what's your point? Well, are you sure you still wanna keep going? Uh-huh. I feel great. - Let's keep going. - Okay. Okay. Follow my lead. All right. Bye. Brett? Okay, I'm safe. Okay. On rappel. - Here, a bomber. Almost. - Oh, shit! Run faster, Rose. - You got this. - Okay. Holy shit. This time, run across, just go for my hand. Yeah, yeah. Oh, shit. Ah. Ow. You all right? Okay. Can you grab some of those friends for me? - What the fuck was that? - I don't know! Oh, fuck. That was a number four, Rose. We needed that. Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, I hope you are. The fuck you do. Come on, it's... Just help me on belay. Hi. How's this look? What? Um, the way I'm looking at you. It's still too much? It's growing on me. Okay. I think she likes it. Argh! Brett! Brett! Brett! Brett, are you okay? You gotta come over to me, okay? I'm gonna throw you the rope. You gotta hold on. Okay, I'm gonna throw you the rope, you gotta hold on. Brett! Wait for me. Brett, I can't get any further! Come on! Keep coming! Argh! Ah! Get here. What happened? Ah, my shoulder. - Oh, shit, Brett. - Careful, careful. Oh, sorry. Oh, fuck. What do we do? What do we do? We're kind of fucked. - "We're kind of fucked"? - Yeah. That's what you wanna say to me right now? Can we just go back the way we came? No. Ah. Can we swing back? No, it won't reach. Well, there's gotta be something we can do. There is, but you're not gonna like it. What? You have to lead this. What? You have to lead climb this. No way. You just fell. How the hell am I supposed to climb that? A hold broke. That happens. And it'll happen again. No, you can't think like that, Rose. No. We're gonna sit here until somebody comes over here. - Nobody's gonna come up here. - Why not? - Other climbers take the route. - It could be days - till another climber does this route. - Somebody will hear us. - Help! - No one's gonna hear it. - Help! Somebody! - Rose. Rose... - Rose! - What? Please, just listen to me, okay? The only way down is up. Now, you see that ledge up there? You need to lead climb up to that ledge and build an anchor. I'll make a prusik with these and make my way up the fixed line. We'll keep doing that all the way up to the top. I can't do that. No, I'm sorry. I can't do it. Rose, you climb... or we die. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Okay. Okay. All right, talk me through this 'cause I have no fucking clue what I'm doing. All right. All right, look... - I'll put you on belay. - Okay. Oh, shit. Yeah. There you go. Can you just... I got ya. Oh, God. Good. Oh, my God. Brett. Hey, stay awake. - Okay. - All right. Yeah? Can you talk to me? Yeah? Oh, it's you. What to talk about? I don't know. How did you become such a badass rock climber? My father... used to take me to a summer camp at Yosemite every year. That's where I learned to climb. That's where I fell in love with it. It was the only thing that made me feel free. Hmm. What was home like? Empty. Brett. Brett. Brett. Hey. Hey. How are you doing? Can you sit up? - Can you sit up? - Yeah. Here we go. Just, yeah, perfect. Good. Shit. Open up. Tilt your head back. Sorry. Okay? You okay. - Yeah? - Yeah. You finish it? All right, we gotta keep going, okay? - Can you stay with me? - Yeah. Look at this. This is where we need to go, all right? Can you see it? Can you focus? Good. Where are we going, hmm? Can you tell me? Yeah, you have to go up that right crack. There we go. Good. - We gotta get moving, all right? - Yeah. You got it? All right. Stay with me, okay? Climbing. - Climb off. - All right. Okay, Brett. Rope is fixed. Rose! Ahhh! Hey, did Brett and Rose sleep here last night? Uh, no, I thought they were at his campsite. No, they are not there. Do you know what route they went on? No, but that was over 24 hours ago. Hey, Jackie. Did Brett and Rose tell you where they were going yesterday? Yeah, as a matter of fact. Killer Pillar. Oh, crap. Brett. Brett has something of a reputation of getting benighted on long routes. We should think about organizing a search party. There's nothing up here, Brett. It is completely blank. I am fine. I am fine. Hey. Brett. Brett. Brett. Brett. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Are you okay? - You okay? - Yeah. It's just... Huh? - Am I gonna die? - No. Hey. You okay? Look at me. I need you to stay with me. - I need you to hold me tight, all right? - Okay. I can do this, okay? I can do this. Oh, crap. You got it, come on. Come on, you are so close, come on. That's it. I got you. There you go. There you go. You did it, Brett. Oh, you did it. Okay, we'll head up into the watch, and then we'll split up. All right, buddy. Let's go. Come on. Hold on. Hold on. All right. Ready? Here we go. Ahhh! That's it. That's it. Good. Good. Oh, God. Sit up. Sit up. You got to stand up, Brett. You got to stand up. There you go. There you go. Come on. Look at me. Right there. Okay. Okay? All right? You got this. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Stay with me, Brett. Come on. Yes. Good. Good. I got you. I got you. Good. I got you. There you go. Jesus. It's them. Hello, Jackie. Rose. Rose. We found them in the wash. We need your help. How's he doing, man? He's breathing. He's got a pulse. You ready? On three. One, two, three. One, two, three. Rose. Come on. Easy. Okay. Hold. One, two, three. - Hi. - How's that shoulder feeling? - It's actually not that bad. - Yeah? Just can't do anything physical with it yet. So that's what Jackie was talking about. What's that? Just listening to your body. - Oh, yeah? I'm listening. - Hmm. - Letting it guide you. - Guiding. My body has a lot to say right now, so... I hope that's not too physical for you. - Hey. - Hey. What's up? - How are you? - Good. - How have you been? - I've been good. - You ready to go? - Yeah. - Yeah? - Come on. Hey, Rose. Climb. Right. Come on, baby.
