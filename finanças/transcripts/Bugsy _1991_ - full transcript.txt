Girl: Papa? MAN: Right. and this one. Here you go. And...that one. And there. That's about it. Okay. Bye, honey. Bye. Okay. See you 6:00 at the station. Bye, daddy. Bye, daddy. ( CAR STARTING ) Bye, dad. MAN: To speak properly it is necessary to enunciate every syllable. Example: 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. Example: 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. To speak properly, it is necessary to enunciate... -You call that an amber? -Yes. And this is..? This is like a lavender, purple. You can wear any of these with the white. Exquisite combination, Mr. Siegel. Oh, yes, tasteful as always. I have some worsted flannel... ( BELL RINGS ) Mr. Siegel. Ralph. Floor please, madam? Penthouse. ( BELL RINGS ) Mr. Siegel: If we make love, it will be the only time. What if you like it? I know I'll like it. I think I got off on the wrong floor. Better get back on. ( BELL RINGS ) ( PHONE RINGING ) ( WOMAN MOANING ) ( PHONE RINGING ) WOMAN: Oh, don't stop. MR. SIEGEL: Is that hurting you? ( PHONE RINGING ) Meyer, will you take it easy? I'm going to be a half an hour. I got ten minutes of sunlamp... All right, I'll do the sunlamp on the train. Of course I'm alone. She was an hour ago. I have thought about it. I got to do it. Call Charlie. You know how he likes to take a nap when there's going to be a little trouble. MAN: Ben, I got to tell you once again that it really does affect my opinion of your ability to administrate when you get yourself involved in this type of detail. Charlie, tell him what you said to me. What do you think I said? See? Then you just shook your head. Of course I shook my head. What else was I going to do? All right. Count to 53. Good evening, Mr. Siegel. Hiya, Dave. Give that a brush for me. Sure. Hiya, Marty. Mr. Siegel. Ted. ( PHONE RINGING ) Hiya, Jerry. Ben, I thought you were on your way to California. I just came to give you a good-bye present. Present? Yeah. Open it. I don't get it. Meyer, Charlie and I we hire you to do a job, and you pay us back by stealing from us for the second time in three years. Stealing? Yeah, the shirt off my back. Do you want the shirt off my back? I'd be happy to give it to you. Here. From Sulka's. They're the ones I wear. I would have bought you some pants and some suits, but you know what? I can give you a couple of tips. Tips? Let me see your shoes. My shoes? Yeah. I don't want to be rude, but they don't match. Another tip... I'm a little confused. We paid to hire three guys to take care of this problem. What are we doing here? What am I going to tell you-- his thinking process? The way I see it, Ben has only one problem-- the same problem he's had since we were all kids sticking up crap games-- he doesn't respect money. Oh, yeah. But you know something? That's for summer, and, Jerry, I don't think you have to worry about summer. Oh, Ben, no, don't. If it was just business to me, I'd be selling insurance. CHARLIE: Remember this, Ben-- the key to knocking off Jack Dragna and taking over the Southern California rackets is to come in smooth. Approach him like all we want is to come in as a partner. He's been running the California rackets for 20 years with no competition. Except for Mickey Cohen who's a one-man gang. So the only way to move in on Dragna is amiably. What about the gambling and nightclubs? Vito, it's 50/50. We don't ruin anything by being too crazy. Just be amiable. Joey A. knows Jack Dragna. What do you think, Joey? Jack's a cold-blooded killer, so you got to be very careful. Just don't say nothing that he'd take offense at. What are you smiling at? Nothing. Why can't we go to California? Maybe next time. What is it? When you get to Los Angeles, don't call George. He's such a big-shot movie star now he attracts more attention than Franklin Delano Roosevelt. The whole trip's got to be quick and quiet. And amiable. Very funny. 12 days-- four days out, four days of diplomacy, four days back. No one even knows you were there. All right. Ben, could I talk to you for a minute alone? After I say good-bye to the family. I'll miss you. I'll miss you too. When I get you on the phone I want you to tell me what presents you want. I know what I want. Don't tell me now. Think about it and surprise me. Okay. MAN: I need money, Ben. How much? $50,000. For what? The cops, the D.A., the F.B.I. They're threatening to lock me up. They're no good, these people, except for this one assistant D.A., Allen Stein. You know their family from Bedford Street. What happened to the 50,000 I gave you? What 50,000? The 50,000 for the armored truck heist? That 50,000's gone. You know me with money. I blew it at the track. Harry, are you saying that if I don't give you $50,000 you'll rat on everyone, including me? You? Never. I love you, Ben. I would never rat on you. Never. You ain't going to kill me, Ben, are you? I'm going to try very hard to forget that this ever happened. I owe you my life, Ben. I'd say that's a fair assessment. God bless you, Ben. Bend your knees, Harry. Bend my knees? When you jump from the train, bend your knees to soften the impact. Bend my knees. Okay, Ben. Sure thing. Are you who I think you are? Yes, I am. Let me have your autograph. ( WOMEN SCREAMING ) Raye? Here you go, Raye. Okay. We'll get everybody here. This has been four of the most wonderful days I've ever spent. A lot of it was in the motion of the train. Ben. Hey. WOMAN: Oh, my gosh. Mister, he knows you. Are you somebody too? Nah, nah. I love you, George. Ben, you're looking great. Like a million bucks of real money. You're looking pretty good yourself, Georgie-boy. Well, that's what they pay me for. We're moving on here. GEORGE: Look, I've got you registered at the Beverly Hills Hotel, bungalow five. I know you said four days, but I reserved six. BEN: Jack Dragna's the kingpin, huh? What do you hear about him? GEORGE: I hear he runs a nice, little operation. You got a city with three million people and he runs an operation that's nice and little? Less to worry about. I'll drop you at the hotel. I got to go the studio. Why don't I go with you? All right, if you like. GEORGE: Hank ain't very bright, but he's my friend and if's he's hooked into a dame like you he's got headaches. WOMAN: You got the blueprints all drawn, haven't you? New cigarette. She's eaten a whole cigarette. MAN: Scene 36, take two. GEORGE: Forget that you ever seen him. This might give you an idea what I mean. WOMAN: Stick that money back to your pocket. Buy yourself some manners. For what? To waste on you? MAN: Marker. GEORGE: Two bucks? For what? Some phony champagne? MAN: That's right, friend. Here's half a buck. Split it between you. MAN: Take five. Marker. Two bucks? For what? Some phony champagne? Here's half a buck. Split it between you. You are so cheap, you are wholesale. Don't forget, mister, I asked you nice. MAN: Marker. Quiet, please. Reset. Let's go. Benny, you want to hit somebody with the chair? MAN: Manpower, scene 38. Take eight. Marker. With this, I can hit home runs all night. Here. Take this in case I come back. MAN: Let's go again. I feel like I should say something. MAN: Honey, he's the star. Let's go. BEN: That was pretty impressive, Georgie-boy. Well, Benny, I'm a pro. You sure are. May I? If you want a simple yes or no you're going to have to finish the question. Light your cigarette. Sure. The way you were staring I thought you were going to ask for something exciting. Like what? Use your imagination. I'm using it. Let me know when you're finished. Now you're going to tell me she's a bit player? Flamingo? Not to Joey Adonis. That's Virginia Hill. BEN: Yeah? That's Flamingo. Don't get no ideas. You know how crazy Joey can get. No woman's worth a bullet between the eyes. Am I right? Depends on whose eyes and which woman. Look, you're Ben Siegel and I'm Virginia Hill. Why are you so interested in a gal who's going with your friend? Joey A? He's no friend. He's an associate of an associate. Are you still going with him? If it were new year's eve, he would be my date. Who would your date be? Wife. Wife? Esta. Esther? Esta. E-S-T-A. I'll bet Esta lives her life faithful to her one and only Ben who plays around like a jackrabbit on the side and lies about it through his teeth. I don't lie to Esta. That's noble. Do you confess your sins three times a day? Now what exactly does Mr. Esta want from Miss Virginia? Mr. Esta is having a tremendous amount of difficulty imagining anything he doesn't want from Miss Virginia. Are you ready for a divorce? Never. Wow. You're pretty ferocious where mom's concerned. The rest of the time you're just another sweet-talking, charm-oozing, fuck-happy fellow with nothing to offer but some dialogue. Dialogue's cheap in Hollywood, Ben. Why don't you run outside and jerk yourself a soda? BEN: Georgie, let me ask you how would someone go about getting a screen test? You know somebody that wants a screen test? No, I just thought that if it came up in a conversation... What about Virginia Hill? You think she's got a future in movies? I don't know if I've got a future in movies. Lana Turner lives there. Cesar Romero lives there. And Gary Cooper is in that house. He paid $45,000. Houses are bringing that kind of money out here? Sure, and more. Whose is that? Lawrence... What's-his-name-- the opera singer. BEN: Melchior? -No, the other guy-- -what's-his-name. Lawrence Tibbett? Stop. What are you doing? Paying my respects. Yes? I'm looking for Lawrence Tibbett. He's in the study. Who's calling? Ben Siegel. Is he expecting you? Not unless he's psychic. Oh, well, uh, would you excuse me for a moment, please? Georgie, how far is your house from here? Half a mile. Benny, what the hell are you doing? Mr. Siegel? Lawrence Tibbett, what an honor and a thrill it is to meet you. I took my wife and daughters to hear you sing rigeletto last year. It was one of the great evenings of our lives. You overwhelm me, Mr. Siegel. -Ben. -Ben? Ben Siegel? You wouldn't be related to Bugsy Siegel, would you? What do you mean "Bugsy"? I beg your pardon. A bug is nothing. The word has no meaning. It's used out of ignorance or malice. A bug is a colloquialism. Insects include a variety of living creatures. They fly. They crawl. They do many things. None of them can be called a bug! I certainly didn't mean any offense, Mr. S-Siegel. Ben. Mind if I look around, Larry? Be my guest. You don't mind if I call you Larry, do you? All my friends call me Larry. What brings you to Los Angeles, B-B-Ben? Curiosity. This is a wonderful house. What do you think of the Beverly Hills Hotel? It's the best hotel in town. Is that where you're staying? Do you prefer the bungalows or the suites? The bungalows. Which one do you have? I don't-- you do. Bungalow five. I don't understand. I'm buying this house from you. This house isn't for sale. Sure it is. Everything's for sale. How much do you want? Mr. Siegel... Ben. Ben. Why are you looking at me like that? Like what? Are you going to hurt me? Hurt you? I would protect you from anyone who tried to hurt you. I revere you. Your voice makes life justifiable. I'm just trying to give you money. What did you buy it for? $35,000, but that was a few years ago. I could probably get $40,000. It's not really a financial issue, Mr. Siegel. Ben. Ben. Ben. Ben. All right. One, two three, four. That's $50,000. Is that enough? That's more than... I want this to be a pleasurable day for both of us. Another ten-- that's 60,000. It just makes me sick when I don't bring pleasure to someone that I admire. Does this bring you pleasure? My goodness, yes. Then why aren't you smiling? The way you spend money, you never have anything left. So I'll make more. It's only dirty paper. What are you going to do with a house? You're here for four days. Maybe I'll stay longer. I got to get to Jack Dragna's. I'll drive you. Uh-uh. This is business. You don't want to be there. Nice car. Thank you. Louie. What the hell is this? Whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm looking for Jack Dragna. Who the fuck are you? Ben Siegel. Oh, I'm Louie, Jack's brother. I'll tell Jack you're here. It will just be a few seconds. Jack's finishing eating. Look, Mr. Siegel... Call me, Ben, Jack. We run a smooth, little operation. With all due respect to you, Meyer Lansky, Charlie Luciano, Joey A, and whoever the fuck else you represent, I suggest you spend your time in California looking for broads, which we got plenty of and which I understand is right up your alley. There's a subject I can help you out on. Phone numbers, whatnot, but if you're coming to me, looking to do business, I'm afraid I'm completely disinterested. Uninterested. Disinterested means impartial. Uninterested means not interested. You got two alternatives. You can take your 64 guys and work for us. That means turning your smooth, little operation into a smooth, big operation-- 20 betting parlors, not three, owning a wire service, not subscribing to one. It means taking risks. Meyer, Charlie, and I put up the money. We take 75%. You keep 25%, which is worth more than three times what your 100% is worth now. What's the second alternative? The second alternative? The second alternative. Hey... No, come on. You take it. I got plenty of guns. Squeeze the trigger, kill me. Kill you? That's the second alternative? Pazzo. You have an unusual sense of humor. I think what they say is true. You're out of your fucking mind. Take another five seconds. Make your selection. I guess that means you're coming to work for us, huh? It's a ball to have you on board. May I have my gun? Thank you. Let's get started. Time is vicious when you take it for granted. Bugsy, I have a question. If we break off this thing with transcontinental... Transcontinental. All right, I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and I will assume that you didn't know that no one calls me that. Very nice meeting you, Jack. Fucking guy's crazy. Want me to run outside and shoot him in the back? Then we got Meyer Lansky, Charlie Luciano blowing bullets up our ass. So what do we do? JACK: We wait, play along. Sooner or later, he'll blow his lid. Then when we get him, nobody will give a fuck.

He's our mortal enemy and this effete count pals around with him? Don't get all worked up over something you can't do anything about. This is Hollywood. Mr. Siegel, there's a telephone call for you-- A Mr. Dragna. I have placed the phone at your table. Hi, George. Ben, have you met our number one crime fighter James McWilde? Haven't had the pleasure. Mr. McWilde is up for reelection as district attorney. I wish there was some way I could contribute. You could contact Donald Mitchell. He handles the money. Have him call me in the morning. You'll excuse me. I see about six women that need to talk to me. As a man of the world what do you make of all these friends that this character Mussolini has flitting around America? I must say, I had no idea that was the case. Are you talking about spies? Come, Jim, the senator is leaving. He must have a word with you. Keep me posted on this Mussolini thing. I will. We've got to do something about that. See the redhead? Put it in her hand. What is it, Jack? This cocksucking Mickey Cohen just robbed our Franklin Street gambling joint out of $56,000 cash. Fifty-six.

One guy robbed five guys in their own place of business for $56,000 and got away scot-free. He took us by surprise. Certainly seems like it. He'll be dead within 24 hours. I don't want him dead. JACK: Why not? BEN: I want to talk to him. You say 56,000? The exact figure we got ripped off was 56,143. That's the figure exactly. Okay. MAN: ...Mussolini and Hitler must be stopped. BEN: Look, that don't fool me. I've been in a couple of cities... ( PHONE RINGING ) Hello? Hi, honey. Yeah, uh-huh, uh-huh... Well, look, Esta, maybe the thing to do is for us is to stop thinking about when I'm coming back to Scarsdale and start thinking about when you and the girls will come out here. Uh-huh. No, as soon as possible. Man #1: Is there anything else? BEN: No. Man #2: Check. Man #1: What's the trouble, folks? Oh, this muzzler's trying to buy out my spare tire. Do you think this is the right time to take the kids out of school? We should play it by ear and see what happens. Yeah... We don't have to settle everything in one conversation, do we? We're going to see each other before you know it. All right? I love you too, Esta. Good night. Ronald, turn off the projector! Don't forget, mister... Ronald, Ronald, turn the projector off! Ronald! Ronald, where are you? Boy, with this, I could hit home runs all night. Am I coming at a bad time? Not at all. Come on in. I don't want to interrupt your pantomime. No, it's just, uh... What are you watching? A newsreel, but, uh... it's over. Why don't you come on in? BEN: Too fast to put a ring on your finger? Nothing's too fast that fits. You always carry around a spare ring? I figured I'd run into you. Would you ever have called me? I was planning to wait a while. When? Oh... Ten years. Ten years? Why? Guess I figured since all we're going to do is bring each other misery and torment... What? Why would we have to bring each other misery and torment? Because we both want whatever we want whenever we want it, and we both want everything. That doesn't sound too promising, does it? That's what I'm saying. Then why did you come? Well, it wasn't caution. Mm-hmm. How about Joey A? We're in touch. Does that bother you? Uh-huh. Because of your conscience or you're worried about screwing up your business? I haven't thought it through that clearly. Well, if he knew I were here with you, the only thing he'd be thinking through is which of us to kill first. Do you want to kiss me as much as I want to kiss you? How do you know I want to kiss you at all? I don't think we should go through with this. Do you? ( CHUCKLES ) Is that "yes" or "no"? Both. ( CHUCKLES ) You pack quite a punch, don't you? That wasn't a punch. It was slap. If I'd punched you you'd be stretched out across the floor. I'm sure you're right. I'm sure you're right about everything. I'm sure you're right about the misery and the torment and I'm sure you're right about what you want... Do you always talk this much before you do it? I only talk this much before I'm going to kill someone. ( PHONE RINGING ) ( RINGING CONTINUES ) BEN: Hello? Hey, Georgie-boy. Did you find Mickey Cohen yet? Uh-huh. All right. Tell him Biltmore Health Club at 1:00. We meet him there. You'll pick me up at noon? Good. You still think we'll bring each other nothing but misery and torment? With a few distractions in between. You call what we've been doing distractions? Uh-huh. Well, thank you. The feeling's mutual. Good. That's the way I like it. 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. 20... What time is it? 1:30. He's half an hour late. Who does this little schmuck think he's fucking with? Who are you referring to, you fruitcake? You better show me some respect. Respect? You got it backward, Mr. Cohen. Unless, of course, your idea of showing respect is to rob his place of business. Who said I robbed? Robbed what, you would-be smoothie? Everything I got is mine. It's yours because you stole it from me. Watch your words. What's mine is mine. Everything I got I'm keeping. I understand from Jack Dragna you stole $56,000 and change. The lying, fat fuck. It was 42, not 56. I thought you didn't steal anything. I didn't, but if I had, it would have been 42. If I were you, I'd give that money back by 7:00 tonight. Fuck you! If I was you I'd shut my fucking mouth and watch my step! Or would you like me to blow your fucking Adam's apple down your spine? Excuse me, but aren't we in a public place? Maybe we'd both be better off if you'd just tone down your rhetoric one notch. Maybe we'd both be better off if I left you altogether and never saw your fucking face again. GEORGE: What are you laughing at? This guy's deranged. Go get him. What? Bring him back. Hurry up. Hey, Mickey! Mickey! Mick... BEN: Jack, it's Ben. I think I got the Mickey Cohen thing under control. I want you to be at my house at 7:30 tonight. All right? Good. MICKEY: George, how do you remember all them fucking lines from them fucking movies? I know you're a big shot, but make it quick. I got a hot date. I don't have time to be schmoozed by the likes of you. I bet you do. I do what? Have a hot date waiting. You making fun of me? No, a guy with your balls must have more women lined up than the Latin quarter. When I go out with a broad, you can bet she'll be a star-- like Betty Grable or Ava Gardner. I don't go for tarty broads like you and your pals from back east. What tarty broads? Shirley what's-her-name that Charlie Luciano drags around. That broad Joey A goes out with, Victoria Hill-- That blonde bimbo, that Moe-Gus-and-Curly fuck. That's Virginia Hill. Whatever. Why call her a tart? That's what she is. Joe Epstein from Chicago, the drummer Gene Krupa, the bullfighter from Mexico, the frenchman... This conversation is beneath me. All right, Mickey, look, I'm expanding and I'm thinking, if I'm going to expand why do it with the guys who got taken? Why don't I expand with the guy who took them? What's in it for me? Money. How much? $5,000 a week. Does that include a blow job? GEORGE: Watch your mouth. You're lucky he don't plug you. He can't. He needs me. Ain't you been listening or have you been too busy learning lines for your fairy acting jobs? -Six. -Ten. But I want the 42,000 you stole back by 7:00 tonight. I put up my life and my liberty on that fucking score. I'll kick back 20. The whole 42 I wouldn't kick back if it was my mother. A penny less, we got no deal. How would he know she fucked Gene Krupa and a bullfighter? Well, it ain't exactly confidential info, baby blue eyes. Krupa, I know about and a couple of the bullfighters. couple of bullfighters. GEORGE: That's what I heard. Ben, she is who she is. You ain't going to change her. What man ever changed a woman? I don't go by what other man have done. I believe in freash starts. Freash starts? Hey, without freash starts you and me would have been history before we were 19. I hope you like scampi served on a bed of soft brown rice, rimmed by carrots and peas. What's the matter? Nothing. Come on, eat. It will make you big and strong. What do you think of bullfighting? It's been a while since I tried it. Well, what are your memories? Dangerous and fun. What about drums? What about drums? I'm a singer. Ever sing with a drummer? I've sung with all kinds of musicians. Are you going to eat or not? Your dinner's getting cold. It's already cold. Were you under the impression that I was a virgin? No, no, no, I just thought maybe there was somebody you hadn't fucked. That's not pleasant. You listen to me, mister. You fucked around, and I fucked around. You want to tell me your stories, fine. Then I'll tell you mine. You want to bury the past, we can do that, too but don't play these games with me. What we share should be good enough. If it isn't, we should call it quits. What will it be? How about iodine? You need some soap and water. Why don't you wash out your fucking mouth while you're at it. I'm going home. Hey, wait, wait, wait! Where you going? Come here. Come here. Goddamn it, let go of me! I'm not staying! Let go of me..! You're not..! Get your hands off me, goddamn it! Goddamn it, let go of me! I'm leaving. I'm never coming back. I'm telling you... Hey, Benny! Ah! Hi, Ben. You okay? I'm fine. 42,000 on the nose. Thank you very much. This is Virginia Hill. Mickey Cohen. Pleasure to make your acquaintance. I've heard a lot about you. You want me to come in? Would you be offended if I took a rain check? Not under the circumstances. What happened to your head? A vicious insect. I'll see you tomorrow. Hey, goombah! Kiss my tukis. Fucking jew prick. Did you ever meet Jack Dragna? No. Good. I got to speak to Jack alone. Will you wait? What for? Will you just wait for me, please? In there. JACK: Cocksucking thief dished it back. Uh-huh. Every cent. -No kidding? -Yep. I'll be a son of a bitch. How did you get him to go along? We reached an accommodation. I gave him a job. What job? Running the day-to-day mechanics of my operation. That's my job. No, that was your job. You're working for him now. I think I'm missing something here. You certainly are-- about $14,000 and change. That's the $14,000 that you stole from us after the 42 that Mickey took. Wait a minute... Do you want to fuck me? What? That's a simple question. Do you want to fuck me? Of course not. You sure? Of course. Let me ask you this-- you want to rape me? This is crazy. Answer the question. Do not lie to me. You stole from me and stealing is a form of rape. Did you think you could get away with it?! Did you think you could steal from me?! From Meyer Lansky, Charlie Luciano, and me and get away with it?! That you could rape us and humiliate us?! Did you think you could get away with it?! No. Do not lie to me! I'm not lying. You're not lying. That means you raped us even though you thought we would catch you. It wasn't like that... What was it like?! You want to change your answer? It's a simple question. Did you think you could get away with it, or not? Did you, or not?! I won't! I won't! You won't what?! I won't do it again! Oh, again! You won't do it again?! How do you know I won't kill you right here?! I'm begging you, Ben. What do you want? You want to kill me? You want another chance? Let me tell you something-- You can't. No one can. I can't kill me. See? Now try it! Give it to me! Come on! I can't! Why? What is it? Are you afraid to die? Crawl. Crawl, come on. I can't. Now, bark-- like the dog that you wish that you was decent enough to be. Bark! Bark! Bowwow? Crawl and bark. Bowwow! Bowwow! More! Let me hear that bark! More! More! Come on, give me more! Louder! Bowwow! Bowwow! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! Yes! That's good! More! More! Now let me hear you oink like the treacherous, devious pig that you are! Come on! Come on! Get around there! Come on! Oink! Now! Oink! Oink! Oink! Oink! Come on! Oink, oink, oink, oink... Yes! Yes! Yes! Oink, oink... Yes! Yes! Yes! Oink, oink, oink, oink... Get up! Get up! Now look me in the eye. Go home, get the money you stole and you bring it to me. This goes back in the safe at the betting parlor. Thanks, Ben. You can count on me for anything. We'll see. Everybody needs a fresh start once in a while. Get out. We going to eat? What? VIRGINIA: Who was the Countess di Frasso? BEN: Who was the Countess di Frasso? You're asking me? Yeah, I'm asking you. She's the wife of that Italian Count. I danced with her at Ciro's. Yeah, I know you danced with her. All right, look, it just so happens that the Countess's husband, the Count, is a very good friend of Mussolini. So? The Countess's husband is Mussolini's good friend. I got it the first time. So what? The world is being destroyed by Hitler and Mussolini. I can stop him. What do you mean? What do you think I mean? Kill him? Kill Mussolini? I am using the Count to get to Mussolini. You are going to kill Mussolini personally in the middle of a war? That is the most pathetic excuse I've ever heard. If you want to fuck some low-life Countess have the guts to say it. Then do it, and fuck yourself while you're at it. I am hatching a secret plan. You're full of secrets. What do you mean? Things not out in the open. What's not out in the open? Me. You're afraid to be seen with me. I'm a secret. From who? You know who. You told me you don't keep secrets from Esta. That's different. Because I'm a secret from her. I don't want to be anybody's secret. You're nobody's secret. Will you give me a chance? You had your chance. We never go anywhere. From now on, we'll go everywhere together. -Everywhere? -Everywhere. Give me a chance. Everybody deserves a fresh start once in a while. Come on, sugar, let's go. I can't, Ben. Can't what? Now you don't understand. I'm sorry. I can't, Ben. BEN: Come on, come on. I'm really much too nervous. Come on, let's go. I thought I could, but I can't. Can't what? Do it! Now that I see the plane, I can't. I never have. Never what? Been on a plane. You never been on a plane? One second. You're going to do what you're going to do. I can't be with you every second. You'll have to go without me. We'll run out of gas before we leave. I just want to explain to you a few basic rules of aerodynamics. No, it would make no difference. I'm not going on the plane. MICKEY: Ben! Let's go! Come on, time is money!

It should have stayed open. Why did you close it? You were right too, it is a canker sore, but you made me look like I was your puppet. Maybe you need someone to tell you what to do even if it isn't what you want to hear.

I don't need this shit. Scarsdale... Shit... Talk to me about Scarsdale-- Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Scarsdale! Shit! What is he doing? Looking for a place to take a leak, I guess.

My husband can get you this close to Mussolini anytime he wishes, and he will wish to do whatever I say. Yeah? I'm a very intuitive person, Benjamin. You know what my intuition tells me about you? That you always get whatever you want. Don't deny it. I find your confidence irresistible. I find myself sucked in by it. Helpless, if you must know the truth. Excuse me. We got a few little wrinkles to iron out yet, but that secret plan, it's going through. I'm going to New York tomorrow. I thought I'd come over say hello and good-bye. Hello and good-bye. I got some real problems in New York. Charlie's been arrested and Harry Greenberg, very old friend of mine, I think he testified against him. Am I supposed to be interested in this? What does your friend do? He sticks knives into helpless animals? He's a guitarist. Flamenco Flamingo. But you're not actually thinking of spending the night with this creep. I demand a retraction. What I do with my time and my body's my business. I demand satisfaction. Would this satisfy you? Go back to your Cuntess, you hypocritical son of a bitch. I hope she gives you syphilis. Let's go, Alejandro. I'm asking Esta for a divorce. Better get to a phone. But I'm doing it in New York. Good luck. Virginia! BEN: I was wearing a blue silk shirt? I don't even own a blue silk shirt. I was brandishing a .45 menacingly. What an outrageous fabrication. First of all, it wasn't a .45. It was a .38. I was not brandishing it. I was concealing it subtly to make a point. What kind of vile, despicable people write this? I agree with you 100%. Got no morals, those people. MICKEY: Benny, everything we heard is true. Charlie's in jail because of this rat bastard stool pigeon. Do you know this guy here, Harry Greenberg? You don't know him? I thought... I know him, all right? Mickey, I'm getting a divorce. That's why I'm making this trip. I'm definitely getting a divorce. Definitely? Definitely. Mmm. What? I'm sorry to hear that, Benny. Why? Why? When I see a family breaking up like that I'm sorry to hear it. What's got to be, got to be. I'm sorry to hear it. I know what you're doing. No, you don't. You don't come one step closer. You're writing "Happy birthday, Millicent" on my birthday cake. Will you get out of here? Set the table, will you? Barbara, where'd you put the presents? In with the potatoes. Presents are with the potatoes. ( DOORBELL RINGS ) Ben. Barb, honey, move the thing in the middle, huh? Okay. I hope we're not disturbing you, Ben. It's Millicent's birthday. There's a matter we have to discuss. Good, 'cause I got a matter I want to discuss with you. Come on in. Come on in. Come on. Make yourselves at home. Pour yourselves a drink. Be right with you. That's Meyer, Joey A, Frank, Gus, Vito, and Moe. I thought we had this night to ourselves. Sorry. I planned to see them tomorrow, but... Does Meyer know that it's Millicent's birthday? I told him. I think they got a problem with this business thing I did. Why don't you finish the cake. Put the candles on. I'll be right back. I got to tell you guys I got rid of that canker sore of a shack in Las Vegas. You had no right to give it up. It was an outhouse. You had no right to close it without consulting us. That's our arrangement, ain't it? I got no arrangement with you, Vito. I do have an arrangement with Meyer and Charlie, but don't worry. When I tell you what I'm going to build you'll understand the meaning of "transcendent." Tell us now. Meyer, I have found the answer to the dreams of America. You want to be more specific? The Flamingo. A bird? What do people fantasize about? Sex, romance, money, adventure. I'm building a monument to all of them. Are you talking about a whorehouse? I'm talking about a hotel. I'm talking about Las Vegas, Nevada. I'm talking about a place where gambling is allowed. The whole territory is wide open. I'm talking about a palace, an oasis, a city. When the Hoover Dam is finished, electrical power will be available on a massive scale in Las Vegas. The Hoover Dam and fucking are connected how? By air conditioning. It's the wave of the future. Everything will be air-cooled-- every room, 72 degrees at all times. the casino will put Monte Carlo to shame. We'll have wall-to-wall carpeting, we'll have Italian marble, badminton courts, stables, a lightning-fast train going from Los Angeles to Las Vegas in an hour. We'll have planes back and forth. Meyer, we'll have our own airport. It's a good place to trap people in to take their money. Is that what you're saying? Much more. Much more. ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) I got to get that. I got it. I got it. Hello? Mickey, have you got someone across the street from her house? Call Warner Brothers. Call Ciro's. Find out if anybody's seen her, and then call me back. No, not five minutes, one minute. Sit tight, honey. Let me just see how they're doing. Oh, that looks great. You know your mother's a real artist? I'm going to run back inside because I got these guys going on this. Ben, don't keep the children waiting too long. They don't have the patience some adults do. You finish the candles in here. I'll finish up out there, then we'll both be ready. Ah, don't you move, my little birthday girl. I don't understand this desert thing. What are we-- bedouins? What's wrong with concentrating on Cuba? You got legalized gambling there. You're right off the coast of Florida. It's like another state. BEN: It's like another state, but it's not another state. A foreign country can throw you out. Nevada is another state. If we do this thing right, if we follow the hotel with schools, churches, and synagogues, we build all the things that give a city backbone, we'll be in charge. In charge of what? The state, and if you got a state the whole country's within your reach. You running for president? We can help choose the president if we control the state. Why be bogged down by petty limitations? Open your eyes. MAN: Where is the money for this... Palace. ...going to come from? Since the partners will be sharing in the success, the money should come from them. Them meaning who? Them meaning you. How much? $1 million. What about the publicity? A place like this will cause a lot of talk. Ben's getting famous in California. Famous isn't good. For Clark Gable, it's good. For Joe DiMaggio, it's good. Famous for you is not good. It will make our gambling interests legitimate. We've known each other since we were too young to fuck. When did I ever ask you to close your eyes and just leap ahead with something on faith? Never, huh? But I'm asking you now. Do this. ( TELEPHONE RINGING ) Hello? Mickey, you mean to tell me that I got you and 65 guys under you on my payroll and nobody can find Virginia? All right, Mickey! Listen to me very carefully. I cannot function effectively when I am in a state of ignorance. Find her. Hold the fort, honey. Daddy will be finished in just a couple of minutes. What's the matter? I thought you came home to be with me on my birthday. I did. I am spending time with you on your birthday. I just got to finish this meeting... Oh, you always... I don't want to hear you! Millicent... Honey, honey, honey. Millicent... We're just going to be... Come on, honey. Millicent, open the door, honey. I just want to say one thing. Barbara, are you in there too? Just come on down, and I'll light the candles. I'm going to light the candles. I'm lighting the candles. Come on down. I'm lighting the candles. Ben. Sorry. The party got a little out of control, but I fixed it. With Charlie in jail, I'll have to confer with him to make any important money decisions final. Pending that talk and his approval, I'm happy to say you've got yourself a deal. Good. Great. When would you be ready to get started? I'm going to Italy in a week so that plus however long it takes. However long what takes? The assassination of Mussolini. Who's going to assassinate Mussolini? Come here. Benny, don't fuck this up by trying to be funny. Mussolini and Hitler have to be stopped. They're trying to knock off every jew on earth. If I don't do something, who will-- A bunch of Italians? I can stop Mussolini. Did you ever hear of the Allied Forces? The Allied Forces don't have the access. I have the access. You have the access? One of Mussolini's best friends is the Count di Frasso. The Count's wife, Dorothy, has the hots for me. She will get me right up close. I can blow him halfway to Siberia. Ben, listen to me very carefully. Don't repeat what you just said to me to anybody else. That's right, it's secret. I'm saying it to you for a different reason. Why? Because at best, any normal person you say it to will never take anything you say seriously again, so nothing more to the guys. Sure, sure, but Mussolini is a dead man. I'm going to light the candles! I'm lighting the candles! I'm lighting the candles! Let's see what Meyer wants to have. We want to go eat. We didn't come here to eat. We came here to do business. We're starving here. All right. I lit the candles. Millicent! I lit the candles! I lit the candles! So, uh, we finished all our business? As far as I can see. We shouldn't have barged in on you like this, Benny. We'll talk tomorrow. It sounds good. Take care, Ben. Thanks for coming. Thanks. Thanks for coming by. Good luck. Thanks. Joey... Listen, uh... I'm sorry about Virginia. You want to take a punch at me, take a punch at me. Well, we're even now. I'm sorry, Joey. I know you were in love with her. Are you kidding me? I'd never let myself fall in love with a slut like her. Your mouth is bleeding. Yeah, I, uh... I tripped. I whacked it on a table. It's nothing. I don't think we can go on like this, Ben. Like what? Do you think we ought to get a divorce? What are you talking about? Some friends just dropped by at the wrong time, that's all. Everything's fine now. Sit down. I'm going to go say good night to the girls. Miss me? Depends. You're looking very smug. So did you ask her for a divorce? Now come on. We got to drink a toast. I got this whole thing worked out in my mind now. I sold them on the idea. We're going to drink a toast to our destiny. So did you ask her for a divorce? Uh, not in so many words, but I got it all mapped out... Do me a favor, would you? Only favor I'll ever ask you. Anything. Finish your drink, get the fuck out and never come near me again. You don't understand. I'm laying the groundwork... Having a good time, huh? Ben! You like that robe? Ben! You maniac! You fucking lunatic! Look what you've done. Are you hurt, baby? BEN: I don't know if you're hurt, but you're lucky you're alive. You got three minutes to get your panties on and get out! He's my brother, you psychotic asshole! You expect me to fall for that? I don't care. I only care that you get psychiatric help and never come around bothering us anymore. Us? us? Leave him alone! He's my brother! Stop it, Ben! Could you show me some form of identification, please? Do you have any? It's in my pants in the guest bathroom. JESUS. I'm sorry. He does very unexpected things. Are you hurt? Are you cut anywhere? Any glass wedged anywhere? Oh, god. You're right. You're Chick. You're her brother. Why didn't you tell me it was Chick? Chick, I'm going to buy you a Cadillac, Chick. A Cadillac? How about a red one, maybe a convertible? A red, convertible Cadillac. Don't sell out so cheap. I've wanted a Cadillac since I was six. BEN: You know what we'll do in Chick's Cadillac? We're going to take a trip. You're going to take a trip. To our destiny-- Las Vegas. You couldn't drag me to that sand hole rattrap with a fishnet. We are going to build a Garden of Eden in the desert. You know what it is? It's an oasis-- an oasis with a casino. It's legal. It's Nevada. We're going to have palm trees and pools. We'll have rose gardens more beautiful than Versailles. We're going to design them all ourselves. Get away from me! We're going to have the greatest entertainers in the world. We'll have Jolson, Cantor, and Durante. We'll have Gary Cooper, Victor Mature. We'll have Dana Andrews, honey, and they'll just hang around because it will be the most beautiful, spectacular place they've ever been invited to. And you are going to own 5 3/4% of the whole thing. Now that's gross, not net. We're going to be the greatest hosts in the west. And we're going to name it after you. We're going to call it The Flamingo. You know, I've brought nothing but trouble to every man Who ever went on the line for me. Good. That's what they get for trying to steal my girl. ♪ ..I'm with you always ♪ I'm with you rain or shine... MAN: My philosophy's always been: Make it different and new, or don't make it at all. That's why I've gone for a separation between the two structures and for a curved effect within traditional linear principles. Sensational, David. Well, thank you. Where did you find this guy, Del? He's terrific. GEORGE: I must say it looks gorgeous to me, Ben. Very european. Very... French. You could sell these here objects in a museum. This stuff is very hard to draw. The relationship with the pool bothers me. What's wrong with the..? If you look, you'll see there isn't enough sun. Isn't the point..? Del, I think your assistant needs to pay more attention. If we slid the pool down here, wouldn't we get the sun on the pool all day? This section of the building wouldn't shield it. Am I right or not? David. Uh, yeah, sure, but that would change the perspective of the pool in relation to the casino. The only thing I'm interested in is if we move the pool, will the sun hit it all day? Yes, it will. Move the pool. Ben, I hate to bear bad tidings, but we've inflated the budget to two million. No problem. Moe: I got to give Meyer a call. Well... That's a lot of extra money. I can't believe he's dead. I just cannot believe it. How long are you going to keep saying that? He was dead the first time you picked up the paper. He'll still be dead an hour from now. I was moments away from carrying out my plan. Ben, the cocksucker's dead. That's what matters. Look at how they got him. You couldn't have done A better job yourself. I couldn't have? Oy... Come here. Tell me what you really think of this David, the architect. What about him? You think he's any good? There's something about him I don't like. What is this fucking red tie? He's an architect. What do you want? Keep an eye on him. Something about him makes me nervous. How did we get him? Ben, don't do this. You'll drive yourself nuts. I got to know the truth. Who ever knows what's going on in the mind of any broad? George, what are you looking at? GEORGE: Nothing. What do you mean? You were looking at Virginia. She was talking. It's natural to look at someone who's talking. You were thinking something. I was thinking... Do you want to trust a dame with your checkbook? I've never known a broad I'd give more than a couple hundred bucks to. I am not trusting a dame. I am not trusting a broad. I am trusting Virginia and I trust her completely. Del: Virginia, if you include that wall... Moe: Benny, Meyer would like to talk to you. Meyer, where are you-- in Miami? A deportation party for Charlie is a very nice gesture. It's horrible. They lock him up, kick him out. What kind of a judicial system do we have? Meyer, never trust a prosecutor. You do know who this house belongs to, don't you? Bugsy Siegel. No, don't ever call him that. Everybody calls him that out here. Not to his face. You could bet your life on that. Things haven't changed that much. BEN: Of course I feel responsible for Harry. I brought him in in the first place. But we always knew Harry wasn't playing with a full deck, but for the jobs we had him do, We both thought he was okay, right? I understand, Meyer. I couldn't agree more. When you find him, You'll have do what you have to do. What overages? Did they ask Michelangelo what it would cost to paint the Sistine Chapel? Did they ask Shakespeare what it would cost to write Macbeth? If it costs a little more, it costs a little more! No problem. No problem. No problem. I'll see you in New York. I'm dealing with a bunch of bloodless bureaucrats. Ben, Harry Greenberg is here. Where? Out in the hallway. Hi, Harry. Ben. What a sight for sore eyes you are. I hope you ain't mad with me for intruding. I had no place else to go. No, you did the right thing. You tired? Yeah, I'm tired. I got an extra bedroom upstairs. Why don't you take a nap? We'll talk when you wake up. Thanks, Ben. It's the first one on the left. Left. Ben. I thought I was dreaming. That's okay. I always think I'm dreaming. That's true. So what do you think, Ben? Am I dreaming Or am I really out here in Hollywood with you? You're here, Harry. Thank god. If I was anyplace else, I'd be dead. I screwed up, Ben. I'm so stupid. I never wanted to hurt nobody except the people you told me to hurt because they was no fucking good. You talked. I talked. Harry... What do you want me to do for you? Well, I thought maybe I could work for you out here. You know, incognito like. It's tough to be incognito in Hollywood. That's true. It was an idea. Bad idea. So what should I do? Better take a drive with me. Yeah, I like driving at night, especially when someone else is doing the driving. I always loved that-- Ever since I was a little kid. I wish you hadn't done what you did, Harry. Virginia, this is Harry Greenberg. Harry's a very old friend. Virginia Hill. Joey A's girl. We met a couple of years ago at the Copa. We're going to take a drive. Oh, I'll come with you. It would be better if you stay. I'd rather come along. I'd rather you didn't. I thought you said you wanted to spend all your time with me. Will you please let us take a fucking drive alone? You can take your whole fucking life alone if that's what you want. You want to come along? Come along. Okay, I got to get my coat and bag. So you seen much of Joey recently? Not for quite a while. Me neither, but I haven't seen any of the guys since I messed up. Joey was always a real sharp dresser. Nice head of wavy hair on him too. Harry, Virginia's going to be my wife. Yeah? No kidding. Congratulations. Thanks. What happened to Esta? Nothing happened to Esta. That's a relief. I thought she died. So what happened to her? We're getting a divorce. We are getting a divorce Only Esta doesn't know it yet. Why do you have to always give me these little digs? Esta is a friend of mine. She's a good person. She's the mother of my two daughters. She is not a threat to you, and I'm going to divorce her. I'm sorry. I was out of line. Harry: You two seem like a very happy couple. It's nice to see that.

We don't want nobody looking at us, taking our picture, writing stories. it's bad enough what they do already. This Flamingo thing can take it out of control. You finished? 'Cause, first of all, The Flamingo is a legitimate operation. There won't be anything to hide. secondly, the money you and Meyer put up was not a gift. This was a favor I let you in on. Fine. Fine. Then let us out-- Now. At cost. No profits. You want out?! You're out! Fellas, this is a farewell party for old friends. Fuck old friends. You don't tell old friends a deal's going to cost $1 million, then come back and say it's two or three or four, or any other shit like that. Not to Charlie Luciano, you don't. We're talking different languages, Charlie. We're talking different languages. MEYER: Ben, please. Answer a question for me. What is the most that this hotel could possibly cost? $3 million tops. I don't give a fuck. I only approved one. One, not three. CHARLIE: What the fuck am I doing? I don't want in what I have in. MEYER: Whatever we want or don't want doesn't matter now. We're stuck, so we do what we have to do to make it work. Within reason. You call any of this reason? I find the whole thing disgusting, and if it is more than $3 million, God won't be able to bail you out. No problem. No problem. One more thing, Ben. The broad... What broad? Why have some broad handle our money? She's not a broad. People are going to have to learn to speak with respect when they speak about Virginia. She's going to be my wife. CHARLIE: Congratulations. I'm sure she'll make a terrific Mrs. Siegel. Thank you. I just hope you know what you're doing, Ben. ( LATIN DANCE MUSIC PLAYING ) BEN: Mickey, I don't want Virginia out of your sight, period. If you take a nap, have one of the other guys watch her. All right. Hello! One of the older guys. Right. Joey. Can I speak to you alone? What do you want? I'm busy. It will take a second. Don't you dare move, darling. I'll get rid of this guy before you can blink those pretty little eyes. Make it quick. All right, look, considering the insulting word that you used to describe Virginia, I think that you owe both of us an apology. -Oh, you do? -Yeah. Why don't you suck your apology out of my dick? Joey! What a thing to say. Suck my... Pull it out. Pull it out. You embarrassed? You want me to pull mine out first? Take a look at this. Can you hear me, Joey? You're lucky I didn't drink a lot today. Your apology's accepted. ( HORNS HONKING ) Extra! Extra! Japs surrender! Extra! Extra! No more war! Are you chewing? I'm chewing. Don't swallow anything till you chew it well. I was thinking that, uh... Could I have some more water, please? Uh, I was thinking that, uh... Anyone want anything else? You just said that a minute ago, daddy. Right. So, what was I saying? Whatever it is, you've been trying to say it all night. Our plans for moving. Yeah. Well, what I was thinking was that, uh... That... I was wondering... Trying to figure out what would be best for... for... I'm going to be in Las Vegas all the time now. it's nothing but a sand dune, and I'll be there with the workmen. I'll be alone and... You could live in the house in Los Angeles, but I don't know if that makes a lot of sense because I'm not going to be there and, uh, maybe the best thing Would be for you to stay here where... Where you feel at home. And see you for a day or two every couple of years? Well... Uh... Excuse me. What? Hey... I'm sorry. You found somebody, haven't you? You want to be with her and not with me. I want a divorce. Is that what you want, is it? I want to take care of you. I want to take care of the children. I want... A divorce. You want a divorce, don't you? Say it! Answer me! You want a divorce, don't you? You want a divorce. Say it! I do. Don't come out of this room for a minute. ( NO AUDIO ) BEN: Is this not the most spectacular sight you've ever seen? It's breathtaking. It's vast. It's intimate. It's original. It's... Where's the pool? Uh, right through here. How can I see the pool from the casino? The pool from the casino? Your point was to get the sun down on the pool unobstructed. I thought we were going to be able to see the pool. We said you could see the pool... The problem is this is a bearing wall. BEN: Okay, get rid of it. David: But it's supporting the entire structure. Ben, you understand what David is saying? I got the point, Virginia. I don't need you to parrot everything this guy says. Look, just get rid of the wall. We can make the wall glass so you can see the pool from the casino, but it's going to be expensive. I got to put a header beam up there. A header beam. You saved the day. Del: With all the overages I'm picking up, we're looking at a budget up near... Virginia, what is it? $4 1/2 million. No problem. Do you understand the position you're putting us in? If you're going to do something, do it right. Who the hell are they? Bugsy Siegel, Federal Marshals. I have a warrant for your arrest. I don't know anybody of that name either here or anywhere else. Benjamin Siegel, I have a warrant for your arrest and a court order directing me to deliver you to the proper authorities in the county of Los Angeles. What's the charge? Homicide. MAN: Hey, Bugsy, is it true that Harry Greenberg was your best friend? Are you guilty? Why did you kill your best friend? Bugsy, give us a statement. Is it true Harry Greenberg was going to testify against all your friends? Mr. Siegel, come on, give us a statement. I only have two things to say. First, the name is Ben, as in Benjamin, and second, I'll see all of you at the opening of The Flamingo on Christmas Day. MAN: Excuse me, gentlemen. I'm Assistant District Attorney Hartman. I'm in charge of this case. You can leave the prisoner with me. Right this way, sir. Don't let anybody else inside. Yes, sir. $30,000 to your campaign's not enough to keep me on the street? Shh. The walls are thin. I had to have you arrested. You got not witness. You can't have a case without a witness. The taxi driver. What taxi driver? He dropped Harry Greenberg off at your house. You got a name? Yeah. I want that name to fall into the hands of Mickey Cohen. It can be arranged, but I warn you, nothing nasty. You don't have to warn me about anything. Mr. Siegel, considering the utmost gravity of the chargesentered against you, murder in the first degree, I order you held without bail. BEN: Mickey, where are you-- in Vegas? All right, all right. Did you do anything about the cab driver problem? Good. Did you see the picture in The Examiner today? Makes me look like I got no tan at all. I look like a marshmallow. Do you mean that or are you just trying to make me feel good? What do you think-- tan or not tan? Tan. Really? All right. Look, stay on top of Virginia, will you? I want constant reports. I feel very isolated in here. All right. Good. Shit. VIRGINIA: I think you'll be surprised at how things will shape up before we're through. He's talking about opening in Christmas. He's going to open in Christmas. Ben is absolutely determined about that. Ben is absolutely determined. Absolutely determined. It will open on time. You've changed a lot since I first met you. BEN: You called me to tell me you were leaving Las Vegas, but you didn't tell me that Meyer was there, huh? I thought it would be better if I told you in person. What did he say? He was worried about the cost. What else did he say? I didn't discuss anything else with him. He talked to Del Webb. Did he ask any specific questions? Just about the demolished wall. What about the header beam? Not exactly but he ducked under it. Ducked? It's low. What do you mean low? Too low unless you happen to be 5'6", but it hasn't been fixed yet. What was his general attitude? Concern, but he never braised his voice. He was nice, like he's always been. What do you mean always? As in the past. You didn't know him in the past. Of course, I did-- through Joey. Did you fuck him? Sure. Why do you ask me that now? You fucked Meyer? Oh, stop it. Don't be disgusting. I meant Joey and you know it. Why is fucking Meyer any more disgusting than fucking Joey? You don't find fucking Joey disgusting?! What is it with you and Joey?! What is the matter with Meyer?! You don't want to fuck Meyer?! Let me tell you something! If they can't get it right, tell them to tear the whole fucking thing down and start from scratch! I have not come this far to have a casino that doesn't let me see the fucking pool! Tear down the fucking casino! Tear it down! Ben, the cost is going haywire. What are you, on their side now?! Don't say that to me. The hell with Meyer Lansky, The hell with Las Vegas, and the hell with The Flamingo! Look, I talked to Meyer for three minutes in the middle of a sand blizzard, trying to say the things I thought you would say to keep things from seeming any worse than they already did. He even said I sounded like you. I just wish the two of us could be alone in Coney Island, eating a couple of fucking hot dogs at Nathan's. Announcer: Your attention, please. This will be the first call for the Super Chief now ready. Board through gates E and F. MICKEY: You'll love Kansas. We got you a job at a cab company. I'll get used to it. What's not to like? That's where Dorothy's from in the Wizard of Oz. You mean Dorothy and the Munchkins? That's right, Will. Don't send any postcards. Paper boy: Extra! Extra! Bugsy Siegel gets off scot-free. Cary Grant, Gary Cooper and Clark Gable. This is going to be the biggest gala opening in history. You are a prince of princes. Ben. See you back at the house. You're welcome. If you have any more luggage, feel free to carry it yourself. The Flamingo's going to come in at six million, Ben. Listen, Meyer, anyone that tells you... Ben, I'm on your side. I'm doing what I can. Stop trying to fool me. Stop trying to fool yourself. You need $3 million. If you can come up with two million, I can come up with one. Charlie knows nothing about this. This is between you and me. Can you come up with that kind of money? No problem. Would you stop with the "No problems"? What are you going to do to get the money? All your property-- your house in Scarsdale, the cars, the stocks, the bonds all belong to Esta and the girls now. Am I correct? Absolutely. Then how will you get $2 million? I'll sell things. What things? I'll sell my house, everything in it... Sounds like 200,000 tops. Where's the other million eight coming from? You always protected me, Benny. When we were kids, you were always behind me, but I can't protect you. My shares. What about them? I own a third of the hotel. That's all you've got, Ben. You'll end up with nothing. But The Flamingo will be there. That's not nothing. Add your two to this. I miss you, Benny. Auctioneer #1: Good afternoon, ladies and gentlemen. We'll begin this auction... Auctioneer #2: It's a pleasure to offer... Auctioneer #3: Sold to the lady in the white hat. Auctioneer #4: 27.50, don't lose it. Yes or no? 27.50. Auctioneer #5: Ah, this beautiful oriental rug. Sold. $400. No advance of $400. Sold for $400. Auctioneer #6: Lot number 17... ( AUCTIONEERS CHATTERING ) Auctioneer #7: It's not your bid, sir. Give him back the $600. I've decided to sell you 10% of The Flamingo. For how much? 60,000 each. I thought the shares were sold. If I'm selling them, they can't be sold. Hey. Look who's here. How you doing, Ben? So? What, did you miss the desert? That's not why I came. Why did you come? BEN: What did she do? She fucked you. What are you talking about? There's a numbered bank account in Switzerland With almost $2 million in it. So? It's hers. There's a lot of numbered bank accounts in Switzerland With $2 million in them. But only one that was taken out by Joe Epstein of Chicago for Virginia Hill of Beverly Hills. I've seen copies of the deposit records, Ben. That's a lie. It's not a lie. Joe Epstein does work for me out of Chicago. He has no reason to lie to me. It's a lie. You repeat it, I'll break your fucking jaw. Can I get a glass of water, Mac? BEN: Do I have to give you a lesson? Get those cases out of my sight. When we're here, we don't want to see boxes. I haven't seen one of those cases Where I told you to put it! Excuse me. All right?! Sorry. Hi. I'm Natalie Saint Clair. Mr. Webb suggested I come talk to you about possibly working at The Flamingo. Yeah, as what? I don't know. Anything. If you could invent a job, what would it be? Uh... a bartender. A bartender. A hatcheck girl. BEN: Did you come from Hollywood? Yes, I did. You're a very beautiful girl. Did you fly here? No, I love to fly, but I couldn't afford it. VIRGINIA: Looking for a girl who likes to fly? Excuse me, would you? Virginia! I want to talk to you. Virginia... sugar. Virginia, we don't have time for this. Shit, Virginia. You almost got me in the head again. Yeah? How do you think I feel watching you chase some bimbo? I wasn't chasing her. she's an employee. An employee of what? The Flamingo. She's going to be a hatcheck girl. Wait a minute. What are you doing? That's baccarat crystal you just shattered. I don't care. You just shattered us. I'm not defending myself. A woman wanted a job. What are you doing? Leaving, and don't try to stop me. I should have gone the day you killed Harry Greenberg. Where are you going? Wherever I feel like. Someplace where somebody knows about a numbered bank account? What fantasy have you concocted in your sick mind? Why don't you just ask what you want to ask? How much money you got in that account? Why? You want to sell me a few shares in The Flamingo? You gave me 5 3/4%. You want to sell me 10 like you did to your friends? That would come to about 300%, or is it four? Just answer the question that I'm really asking. How much money have you stolen from this hotel? I've done 100 times the amount of work I would have to do to justify taking anything. How much did you get your hands on? Nothing, and I could have taken a lot. And you wouldn't have known the difference because you're an irresponsible, unrealistic, unreliable, undependable, philandering fuck! I should have taken something, but it isn't in me to violate the trust of the one person in my life I have been stupid enough to give myself to, the one person I've been stupid enough to love. How much money you got in that account? How much did you steal? Damn you! How much? Bye-bye, Ben. You're on your own. CHARLIE: First of all, let me say how much it means to me that all of you've taken the time to fly down here and pay your respects to a lovely, Italian exile with a swollen prostate gland. It breaks my heart that the tragic mess with The Flamingo Hotel is being perpetrated by one of my dearest friends in the world-- Benny Siegel. Here's where we stand right now. The Flamingo's going to open on Christmas Day. My hotel friends in the know tell me it's the stupidest fucking time we could ever pick to throw open a new joint to the public. Total cost of the hotel is now $6 million, which is five million more than the original figure. To get the last few million he needed to finish construction, Benny's had to sell 400% of the hotel. A lot of people who think they got major shares in this joint are famous individuals, like movie stars and wealthy businessmen with political connections, who ain't just going to get stiffed when their time comes to collect. Not that there will be a time to collect 'cause chances are this whole thing is going to be a total, fucking fiasco. All of this is nothing compared to the more serious matter at hand which is the question of stealing. My banking friends in Switzerland tell me this Virginia Hill-- this broad Joey A. used to fuck and Benny's so head and heels over-- she's pulled off a couple of million in loose change for herself from this here deal. For me, there's a simple, basic question we have to answer. Did this broad steal this money without Benny knowing anything about it, or was she just fronting for Benny like a shill? Anybody that thinks Bugsy Siegel didn't know about this is crazy. Benny Siegel. There's no need for disrespect. Oh, yeah? What about his disrespect to us? Benny's got to take the rap. I agree with Joey and Frank. How do all the rest of you feel? All: I agree. Meyer? I don't believe Benny knew what Virginia Hill was doing. He was blinded by love. Benny's always put women first. That's what makes him Benny. Only this time it's one women that's got him instead of the whole damn female race. So I believe Benny would accept anything that broad told him. There's no chance he stole from us. No chance he knew about any stealing. Benny's got one basic problem-- he doesn't respect money. He's not even interested in money for himself off this deal. He's interested in the idea. What idea? Building something. Making something. Benny's a dreamer. I'm not excusing it. I'm explaining it. I'm a businessman. As far as I'm concerned, Anything that broad took Benny's got to make good on. What do you want to do about it, Meyer... As a businessman? Give him till Christmas, when the hotel opens, see if it works. If it does, we'll be happy. Let him pay off her debt. What if The Flamingo goes bust? Then I'll handle it myself. ( THUNDER RUMBLING ) 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. 20 dwarves took turns doing handstands on the carpet. 20 dwarves took turns... BEN: No word from Clark Gable or Gary Cooper? GEORGE: Not a word. Worst luck I've ever seen. You can do all kinds of things, but you can't control the weather. No mere mortal ever could. We can't lose heart. ( LOUD THUNDERCLAP ) ( SCREAMING ) MAN: Flashlights! Check that fuse box. What the hell is going on? Flashlights. Can we get some flashlights? Ladies and gentlemen, I want to thank all of you for coming here tonight to try to make the opening of The Flamingo a success. Due to the implementation of further refinements in the hotel, which will make The Flamingo an even greater place, which you can all enjoy, uh, I am going to announce the temporary closing of the hotel effective as of friday night. I hope to see you all At the grand reopening of the hotel, The date of which will be announced soon. Thank you very much. Ben, Meyer Lansky's on the phone. He wants to talk to you. Meyer. No, we're shutting down temporarily on friday night, and we... Why would I fly to L.A. tonight to see Gus and Moe? Meyer, Meyer, Meyer, I want you to do something for me. I want you to promise me, no matter what happens, you'll protect Virginia. You give me your word on that, I'll go to L.A. tonight. Do I have your word? Good. Meyer, you want a tip? Never sell your shares in The Flamingo. You'll live to thank me. ( HORN HONKING ) ( HONKING ) I'm sorry, Ben. What do you mean? For what? I should have been with you. What do you mean? You're here now. You're the only one. They told me you have to go to L.A. I got a meeting in two hours. Meyer's sending Gus and Moe. Ben... If you're going to L.A. for money you may not need it. What do you mean? $2 million. I always said you were a better businessman than I was, But I... I... I don't... I... I don't get it. I don't know. Maybe I... Maybe I took it for us, or maybe I took it for me. I don't know. It's just... You get a little confused, and you get afraid... I don't know. Maybe I thought I'd buy us a couple of hot dogs at Coney Island. I tell you what. Why don't we just leave it in the bank. We'll save it for a rainy day, huh? I got to go. Want me to go with you? I'll come with you. Fly? Yeah. In this weather? Yeah. I see. Get out of here. Be back in a couple of hours. All right? I love you, Ben. You know something, Mick? You got Virginia all wrong. Tonight, she was willing to fly for me. I don't want to talk about Virginia, Ben. All right. Good night. ( HUMMING ) BEN: I am on to your racket. MAN: You've got the blueprints all drawn, haven't you? Yeah. You got a line, sister, but it don't make a wife for a right guy, so I'm telling you straight forget that you ever seen him... Yeah. You got a line, sister, but it don't make a wife for a right guy, so I'm telling you straight forget that you ever seen him and if you don't get what I mean, this might get... give you an idea. MAN: Now, listen, mister, before you came in here, I was worrying about henry... ( GUNSHOT ) I figured I wouldn't marry him because he is a regular guy, but now... ( GUNSHOT ) I'm so sorry. I beg your pardon. But now... Now I'm going to marry him. Is there anything else? BEN: No. Then what's the trouble? Two bucks for what? One beer and some phony champagne? That's right. Split it between you. Ain't you being a little hasty, pal? You're so cheap, you're wholesale... ( AUDIO SLOWING DOWN ) That's all it's worth. You don't want to get into no trouble, do you? I just had this suit pressed, and it was... VIRGINIA: And what about the... during the electric storm? Del: Well, we had water. VIRGINIA: Hello, Moe. Virginia, this is Gus Greenbaum. Meyer Lansky sent us. We're taking over control of The Flamingo hotel. Ben Siegel controls The Flamingo. Bugsy Siegel is dead. The Flamingo belongs to us.
