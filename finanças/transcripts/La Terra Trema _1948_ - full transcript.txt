Good weather or bad, neither one lasts forever. Could this calm sea be the same one that swept 'Ntoni's boat so far out? And so one day, rounding Capo dei Mulini... the Valastros' boat returns... which by now everyone had almost forgotten. Bandiera found them drifting somewhere... and is now towing them back in. Bastiano! Bandiera's boat is back, with 'Ntoni's in tow! So this is how they return.: 'Ntoni, Cola, Grandfather and Vanni. They lost everything.: the nets, the mast, the oars, the sail. The boat, its side split open, barely stays afloat. It wasn't enough that their fellow man was their enemy, Nature was there too... and in a single night wiped them out utterly. The wholesalers will now have their revenge. 'Ntoni will pay dearly for his rebellion. You brought this disaster on yourself!. See what you've done by being so stubborn? You'll never be a wholesaler, wretch! Now you'll pay for your mistake! One should listen to his elders. Courage, 'Ntoni. What a miserable trade a fisherman has! It's not the end of the world, 'Ntoni. Let's go home. Mother's waiting. 'Ntoni's back. Look! My son! My son! My son! We're back, Mama. Take heart. Will you be quiet? Leave us in peace! I'm a miserable wretch with rotten luck... doomed to struggle against fate to feed my family! Don't take it so hard. -There must be an end to our bad luck! Quiet. Grandpa will hear you. -Bring me some water to shave. Right away, 'Ntoni. Bring the bottle. Now we have to think about paying our debts. Mother has prepared lunch. Let's go in and eat, Grandpa. Grandfather stares before him with lifeless eyes. ''Now we have to think about paying our debts", he said. Meanwhile, 'Ntoni and his brothers, the young men of the family... haven't yet fully grasped the extent of their misfortune. But 'Ntoni still has Nedda's love. Nedda will stand by him. Open up, Nedda. It's 'Ntoni! Nedda, open up! Can you hear me, Nedda? Open up, Nedda. It's 'Ntoni! Nedda! Isn't anybody home? How's it going, 'Ntoni? - Any work for us? - We've got a full crew. If it was you alone.. Sorry. That's all right, Uncle Angelo. Now that they've lost everything... 'Ntoni must find a job somewhere... even if it's hard to work on someone else's boat, when he once had his own. But even this is denied him. No one has any work for him. Now not even a dog welcomes him in Trezza. - Greetings, Signor Viola. - 'Ntoni, how are you? Got any work for me? Are you a mechanic? What mechanic? I'm a fisherman! Then I'm sorry. I can't help you. I suppose you can't. Good-bye, Signor Viola. Lucia, there's Don Salvatore. Don't let him see us! Greetings, Miss Lucia. Mind if I chat a minute? If I were alone I'd mind... but since Mara's here, I guess it's all right. Mara's here too? Hello, Mara. Sorry, I didn't see you. Greetings, Don Salvatore. You know, this village is full of gossips. If they happen to see you at our window- I don't say it on my account. I'm thinking of Lucia. She's so young. A girl has to be happy, Miss Lucia. The gossips are jealous of you and your good looks. If you were ugly, no one would say a word. Don't you ever think of getting married? Well, until now... I haven't. Well, you should. But don't get married in Trezza. You're a city girl. You don't fit in here. You should wear fine clothes, not those old rags. See what I've brought you. A pretty silk scarf, as if made just for you! Please, I can't accept it, even if you kill me! At least have a look at it. Don't be offended, Don Salvatore. We're poor now. Such fine things aren't for us. I'm not upset... but I don't deserve this. It's too beautiful for me! Lots of girls not even as pretty as you have one. Because they're rich- we're not. Even if you don't want it, I won't take offense. I like you anyway. All of you. Don Salvatore will always be your friend, remember that. No matter what happens. Good-bye, Miss Lucia, Good-bye, Miss Mara. Good-bye, Don Salvatore. Thank you. Don Salvatore really is a friend. That was a nice scarf. I like silk scarfs... and earrings... and necklaces. Their last riches, the 30 barrels, now had to be sold. But to whom, if not the wholesalers? These are the anchovies. We have 30 barrels. All the same quality? Yes, they were all salted at the same time. I'd like to see for myself. Right. Then we'll agree on a price. Is this your stuff, 'Ntoni? Don't you see it's no good? Tiny, shriveled up, clotted with too much salt... and rust, even. They're too dry too. Lorenzo, look at this. Only it for cats! Are you joking? The stuff's all good! You want it for nothing, don't you? Forget it. I'm not being taken! Hello, everyone! I brought the truck. I'm ready when you are. You can take it back. No use waiting. Doesn't look like there's gonna be a deal. We know our business, and we know what's good and what isn't. We worked hard for these 30 barrels. You think we found them on the street? Everybody leans on a low wall... so put your weight somewhere else. You're not pressing us down! That stuff's no good to us. We know our business too. Let's go. Let them go, Cola. They only came to suck our blood. You Judas swine! We know your business. It's taking advantage of people. Now you're showing your true face... the face of greed! Are you saying we're thieves? Over and over we offered to buy your barrels. You wouldn't sell. You were saving it up for winter. So if you want to sell now, sell... and if you don't, throw them back in the sea! We'll give you 80 lire. Parasites! Sharks! Crooks! Get out! I'd rather throw it back in the ocean! Suit yourselves. 'Ntoni, Cola, I'm sorry to see you treated that way. Every wind is bad for a sinking ship. But when the ache of hunger is in your throat... you'll settle for anything. You give in, even if you're plundered in the process. ''I'll bore a hole through you yet, '' said the worm to the stone. Rough weather, boys. Feels like the sirocco. We can't go out to sea. -It could last a week, eh? Anything's possible-- even that. We are working hard now, so later we can afford to rest up a while. Without work you can't afford to eat. You can't even afford to smoke. Cigarette? - Thanks. One for my friend too? - Go right ahead. These are good cigarettes. American. Lucky Strikes. - We never get these around here. You like them? Then listen to me. - Hey, let me have a puff. -Just a minute. Cola! Hello, Santo, give me a light. This is Cola, the one I was telling you about. 'Ntoni Valastro's brother. He's out of work. Is that right? You're out of work? Yes, that's right. What's it to you? I'm interested because... I can help you. Have a cigarette. Santo, who's that? I don't know. An American, I think, with lots of cigarettes. - You know the guy? - Let's see what he's got to offer. Who indeed was this stranger, and what did he want here? What is he offering young men like Cola, at the end of their rope... doomed to die of hunger... shackled like dogs on a chain? Cola, what are you doing in my sea chest? Did you find work? You took my knapsack. No, nothing yet What could I do? The excuse today was bad weather. Bad weather or good, there's always some excuse. I can't stand being reduced to nothing but misery. We've been looking for work for a month? We haven't earned one cent. What's left for us? Stealing? Every door is shut in our faces. Meanwhile, we all starve: the family, you, me. What good did selling our anchovies do us? We sweated blood for those barrels! They were to be the start of our fortune. But instead they only kept us... from sinking for a short while. Now the devil's got us where he wants us, and there's no hope. We should have thrown them back into the sea before giving them to those swine. I get sick thinking of how crooked they are! It's getting dark. You know what? I'm fed up with living here. I can't believe that people in other parts of the world are as mean as in Trezza. I'm tired of living here. You shouldn't talk like that. We were born in Trezza... and we must die in Trezza. Even if it means we suffer. Maybe you're right, 'Ntoni. You know the world. Taranto, Bari. You've even been in Spezia. It's a big world outside this village. If there's a way of making our fortune... I want to help you... and our family. The sea is the same all over the world. But outside our harbor are strong currents and disaster. Keep this in mind, Cola: Our struggle is here! ''Keep this in mind, Cola: Our struggle is here!'' This is what 'Ntoni tells his brother. If you're born in Trezza, you stay in Trezza. It stopped raining. I do want to help you, 'Ntoni. But one thought torments Cola. He yearns to set out to make his fortune... in some enchanted city like on the picture postcards... where a man could get rich and help his family. - Hi, Cola, Cola, I'm going to bed. How can you go to bed all wet like that? - Vanni! - What? - Bring me a towel. - Wait, I'm doing something. How did you get so soaked? - Where were you? - At the castle. It's really cold. Were you playing there? You're so wet! You're hungry, aren't you? Here's the towel. I got work in Cannizzaro today, picking oranges. I earned 350 lire. I was lucky, eh? They didn't want to hire you? That's right. No work at all. They've ganged up on us. Don Gentili took me on because he was short of people. Put the money away. 350 and 200 from yesterday, plus the 400 we saved. Give it to me. I'll put it in the drawer. Why don't we put the money in the drawer? That way you can't lose it. It's terrible to lose money you've worked so hard for. Cola! Valastro! 'Ntoni Valastro! Isn't anyone home here? Yes, they're home. Knock harder. They're hiding inside. Good day. Are you the heirs of Sebastiano Valastro? We're here to foreclose on your mortgage and seize the house. We're from the Fidani Bank in Catania, the bank that gave you the loan. Engineer, show them the foreclosure order. Here it is, signed by the judge. It authorizes us to take possession. Start checking the building. Check the strength of the load-bearing walls... and take a precise measurement of the square footage. 'Ntoni! 'Ntoni! -What is it? Concetta says the bankers from Catania have brought the bailiff. - Where? - At your house. This is a load-bearing wall. This one is too, but it's in bad condition. No brick support, only stone. This wall is weak. It won't last long. The furniture's worthless. The paint is peeling, The ceiling needs repair. Shall we examine the other rooms? Tomorrow morning at 4:00 at the place I told you. All right. We'll be there. Right, Nino? Let's go. - I'm taking a cigarette. - Coming, Cola? In a minute. -See you tomorrow. Did you get that? Let me explain. Look, here's the boat This is the Vicolo Varcanaci Lane... and this is the main road. This is Bastianello Lane... and this is your house. This is the path you take to get to the boat. Good-bye, Mother. Good-bye, Grandpa. Good-bye, 'Ntoni. Good-bye to you all. I'm leaving. Please forgive me for what I'm going to do. I'll be back soon... and we'll be a happy family once again. Got half a cigarette? Boys, is everybody here? Let's go! Cola's gone. They've come to take him. For those down on their luck, when trouble starts there's no stopping it. Grandfather became ill... and they're taking him to Catania... to the Santa Marta Hospital. Grandpa! Nights find 'Ntoni in the taverns... carousing with the riffraff of the town. It's a way for him to forget his misfortune and chase away sadness. At least he needn't feel ashamed in their company. There are no recriminations, no talk of work. If you're drunk, it's best to steer clear of the sergeant... though it's unusual for him to be out at this hour. He must have gotten lucky with a girl. Go on playing. He's far away by now! - Where have you been? -Be quiet, 'Ntoni will hear you. 'Ntoni's not here. He's not back yet. He goes out every night... while I sit and wait for him. Were you waiting for me too? If our mother knew, she'd die of heartbreak. With all the sorrows she's had! What did I do? I haven't done anything wrong. So go ahead and tell her! I do what I please, and no one can say a word. Locked up here like some kind of treasure! Some treasure... nobody'll marry us! Don't say that, Lucia. We may be poor now, but we must still guard our honor. And we have to work to help 'Ntoni. 'Ntoni, sure! He brought us to this! He's given our house away! And what's he doing about it? Carousing at night with his drunken bums! Cola's run away, grandpa's in the hospital. You want to know something? Someone told me we better keep an eye on 'Ntoni or he'll do something foolish! Who told you that? Don Salvatore, right? - What's this? - Nothing! It's mine. Yours, is it? Shame on you! - Let me go! - Shame on you! Who in Trezza would marry her now? Her name is on the lips of everyone in town... because of Don Salvatore One by one the tree's branches wither and fall. - Greetings, 'Ntoni. - Greetings. Haven't seen you around. How are you? All right. You don't come down to the quay anymore? Too bad you're not fishing anymore, You're a good fisherman. But you'll forget how if you stay at home. I've got lots of boats going out every night. - We'd rather starve to death! - So you refuse? Even after you see where your arrogance got you? That's my business! Leave me alone! Is it your new friends that make you so sure of yourself? What's that supposed to mean? I don't know... but word is out that 'Ntoni Valastro has become a shiftless bum... frequenting dives... oblivious to what's going on at home. You louse! If we're poor, it's because of you and others like you. Now get out! Mother of God! They're killing each other! Get out of my house! 'Ntoni, you almost killed him! I'll be back! God is punishing you for your arrogance! It made you're the worst family in Trezza! 'Ntoni, the eviction notice came. ''You are hereby notified... of the foreclosure on your mortgage due to non-payment. The premises must be evacuated within ten days of this notice.'' Let's put the sheets in the chest too, Mother. Mother, I'm going out for a minute. I'll be right back. Make it quick. - Is that you, Mara? - I came to say good-bye. I'm glad you thought of me. Is it true you're leaving tonight? The bank has taken our house. We must leave. Good-bye, then. From now on, your window will be closed, and so will be my heart. It's God's will, Nicola. God's will is bitter, Mara When you've finished this wall... where will you work next? Wherever there's work. With winter coming on, there's little to do. I may go to Catania or Siracusa. Well, I'll say good-bye now. Mother is waiting. Nicola, remember when you said that now that we were rich... you were too poor to marry me? See how rich we've become? We don't even own our four bare walls... or a tile off the roof of our house. I don't care, Mara. If I could do what my heart tells me... I'd know what I'd do. Now things have changed. I can no longer hope to marry. It's God's will. You're from a better family than me, from a family of owners. But now that you have nothing... with my strong back and hard work, you'd never lack for bread. Forgive me, Mara For saying such things. When you come back to town, come by the house we're moving to. Good-bye, Nicola. I have to go. Is this to go in the trunk? Now they must leave their house... in which so many Valastros were born and died. They must turn their back on those walls... and on those stones worn smooth by their daily steps. Let's go, Mother. On behalf of everyone, I would like to thank our noble baroness... who kindly accepted our invitation to the christening of our new boats. These boats will provide work for ten crews. Here in Acitrezza we're good, hard workers. Except for someone who's been touched in the head, and wants to go his own way. Long live our chief!. Our thanks to the people of Acitrezza... for helping to christen our new boats. Now the Valastros have nothing left but their tears. One day 'Ntoni goes down to the caulker's to see his old boat. Hello, 'Ntoni. There she was, with her proud planks whose knots he knew so well. There's where Cola used to sit, and Grandpa... and Vanni, and even little Alfio, the boat boy. Just like their house, their boat had now passed into the hands of strangers. - What do you want? - This is your boat, isn't it? We're fixing it up for you. -That's nice, but... I don't have the money to pay for it. You know that, don't you? I know. Everyone says you're poor. They don't like you in the village. I know. I'd help you if I could. How could you help me? Those who could help me are envious of each other. They don't understand that what I did was for all their sakes... not just for mine alone... so now they've abandoned me. Some are after my flesh, others are after my bones. This boat belonged to my family but now she's in bad shape. They say it's my own fault. But one day they'll see I was right... and the day I lost it all will become a good thing for everyone. We have to learn to care for each other. And unite for our common good. Only then can we go forward. ''I'd help you if I could.'' Those were the first kind words 'Ntoni had heard in a long time. But no one can help him until everyone learns to care for eachother and unite for the common good. Until then, 'Ntoni must find in himself the courage to start over. 'Ntoni! Come see your boat again soon! Were you going to sell this? Wait. Alio, come here! Stop looking at that. It'll only make you hungrier. Well, look who's here! Old starvation-face! Hunger drives the wolf from his lair, eh? Let him pass! Move back, all the way back! 'Ntoni, my boy, come in! Look who's here! The lost lamb has returned to the fold! 'Ntoni! The one who wanted to drag everyone else down with him. You see now that your ideas don't work? I'm putting together crews for four fleets. There's a place for you. Want to sign on? Yes, I do. Just you, or your brothers too? With my brothers Vanni and Alio as my helpers. Look at the mother hen with all her chicks! Come on, I'll take the whole flock! We know. Lorenzo, assign them to Menicuccio's boat. Will that be all right, 'Ntoni? Menicuccio's got a good crew. Go ahead and sign up. 'Ntoni, didn't you once tell me... that you'd rather starve to death than work for us again? Where do I sign? Here. And sign for your brothers too. - You'll get full pay. - What about my brothers? The crews are full. I can't change them now. Vanni gets half pay. Little Alio gets quarter pay as a boat boy. All right? Uncle Giovanni, you'll work the oars in Rosso's crew at full pay. - Fore or aft? - If you don't like it, see Raimondo. Why can't I sit aft, like I used to? It's not right! Thank God we're taking you at all! If you're gonna start complaining, you can buy your own boat too! Here's another starving man coming to be rescued! Carmelo, you only come to us when you're starving, eh? Here's some bread. Eat, my friend! We're really very easy to get along with! You'll go with Pappalardo's crew. We just want to give everyone a chance to earn his daily bread. Right, Raimondo? We want to help everyone! Next! - Bless me, Mother. - Blessings. - Bless me, Mother. - Blessings. Take this, 'Ntoni. Sister... it's good weather for anchovies. - Bless me, Mother. - Blessings. So the Valastros start over again... and return to the sea. Bitter is the sea, and it's at sea that a sailor dies.
