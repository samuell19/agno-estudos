no, no! you okay? I'm not sure. What is it? I just had the strangest dream. Well, you're in luck, because strange dreams are my specialty. I'm not kidding. It scared me. I thought you never got nightmares. That's just it... it didn't seem like a nightmare. It seemed like... Like what? No! nothing. Never mind. Come on. Now you're just teasing me. Spill. You're not on the clock, doc. Go back to bed. Oh, no, no, no, no. You're not getting off that easy. You woke me up, so... It's either shop talk... ...Or sex. whoa! Looks like someone's had too much caffeine. -Hey! -What? Since when do you drink coffee? Since forever. Shoot, I'm late. Um, is ruth picking you up? Yes, mom. I'm just asking, honey. Where's your father? Try the inner sanctum. Jordan? Honey? We've had this conversation. Put the phone away. Sit down and eat properly. Hey. Are we still on for dinner with doreen tonight? If everything goes well. If it doesn't, I'll be updating my resume. Hmm. You are always glass-half-empty. I saw her financials, otto. If I don't land this whale, the whole ship could go down. Whoa, whoa. Hey, relax. You got this. Right. Okay. Someone woke up on the wrong side of the bed. jordan? Your friend's here. Yeah, I'll be there in a minute. Dr. Croft. Hello, ruth. How's the, uh, how's the shrink business? guess I can't complain. Wow, is this a givenchy? Uh... I have no idea. Looks really good on you. Thanks. It was a gift. From who? From his wife. oh. Hey, you ready to go? Yeah, let's bounce. -Bye. -Bye. Bye, mom, dad. Have fun, you two. what? Oh, she's got a thing for ties. She's got a thing for you. She's 18. It's just hormones. Yeah, well, I don't like her hanging around our daughter. Hey, are you... You okay? You're acting kind of strange. it's just that dream last night. It really put the hooks in me. Well, are you sure you don't want to make an appointment? I got some time this afternoon. I think I can handle it. That's my girl. You're gonna be great. I'll see you tonight. oh... More dan problems? I put out for that bastard, and he's sucking up to geri collins. define "sucking up." have you seen the stuff she instagramed? She wouldn't know style if it bit her on the ass, and he's like, "yo, girl, that's so fresh." he's such a jerkoff. -This too shall pass. -You know what the problem is? No, but I bet you're gonna tell me. Guys our age are all morons. I just want to meet somebody older. What, like a frat guy? No. No, gross. Not a frat boy. No, someone more mature, like your dad. What? Relax, I didn't mean I want to... You know, with otto. Just someone like him. Whoa! Can we... can we change the subject? I actually just threw up in my mouth a little bit. no! No... Sorry. it is her. "her" who? Oh... Nothing. Good, because mr. Lee will be arriving in five minutes. Oh. Right. Sorry, doreen. What do we say about apologies? "if you have to apologize, it's already..." ...Already too late. -"...Too late." that's right. So, this is the biggest meeting of both our careers. Hmm? Don't you dare screw it up. Okay. Let's go get 'em. I'll have this year's sales projections sent over immediately. Do you have any other questions? Just one, ms. Croft. If I were to come on board as both investor and partner, who would be in charge of all the financials? That would be me. With the expansion into the asian market, we'll be hiring a junior accountant. Um, three junior accountants, actually. I see. Forgive me, but you don't seem to be giving this your full attention. Is something wrong? Um... Wrong? No, nothing's wrong, I'm fine. ms. Croft? ms. Croft? I need a minute. mr. Lee... What the hell is wrong with you? Remember. karen. Oh... what is going on? You just left him standing there. I have to leave. Excuse me? I'm sick. The stomach flu. Okay, are you insane? We've been working on this deal for five months. You know how important this is to me, to our company. We need this investment. I'm sorry... I just can't. karen! honey? Karen? You home? karen? Karen? hey. You okay? W-what happened? I keep seeing her. She's everywhere. Shh-shh-shh-shh. Calm down. Calm down. Who's everywhere? Gina. Gina navarro. I think I killed her. it's okay, it's okay. I've got you. I've got you, I've got you. I've got you. So what's the prognosis, doc? Am I crazy, or what? You must have seen this poster before you had a dream about her, o-or a news report. You know, one of those "true crime" dramatizations about the case. I didn't. I don't want to devalue your experience, which I'm sure felt very real, but think about it. What makes more sense? That you murdered a complete stranger and just don't remember, or that you simply forgot about seeing a reconstruction of what might have happened to her, and then your subconscious fed it back to you in the form of a nightmare? It wasn't just a nightmare. I've been having visions of this woman while I've been awake and walking around. It's like my brain is trying to tell me something. That you're responsible for her death? That's ridiculous! Karen! Look at me. You are not a killer. What if I am? I want you to hypnotize me. you do it for your patients all the time. My patients have psychological issues. Addictions, bad habits, things they can be conditioned to resist. I have a psychological issue and her name is gina navarro! I need you to put me under and take me back to the night when she disappeared. I need to know if these memories are real. Will you help me or not? this is crazy. How could you even be involved in her disappearance? Have a seat. Now, this... Is a strobe light. Repetitive visual stimulus helps induce a hypnotic state. Alter the pattern and the patient comes out of it. Yeah, yeah, yeah, I already know all that. Sorry. Force of habit. Can we just get on with it, please? Do me a favor and relax first. That's easy for you to say. Do we have to record this? Honey, you won't learn anything unless we do. Now, karen... Trust is crucial for hypnosis to work. Do you trust me? Of course. Good. Now lay back. Are you comfortable? Yes. Good. So I want you to look into the light... And allow yourself to just completely relax. The only thing that exists is the light. Now, I'm gonna count down from 10. And when I get to one, you'll be asleep. Ten... Nine... Eight... Seven... Six... Five... Four... Three... Two... One... One... One... One... oh, my god. Oh, my god. Somebody, help! miss! Miss! You don't want to do this. please, get down from there. I can't move! Yes, you can. I'll help you. Listen, all you need to do is swing around and face me, okay? oh, is that it? Sounds pretty easy. Ohh. Oh. I hate heights. You can do this. I've got ya. come on. Okay. Nice and slowly. Very good. here you go. Come on. I've got ya. Okay. Okay. I've got ya. There you go. Very good. Nice and slow. Are you okay? Yeah. Yeah, I think so. What happened? You tell me. I was coming home from work. I saw you up on the railing and figured I'd better do my civic duty. Where are we... Where are we? The north dam. How did I get here? Is this your car? Yeah. I think I drove here. Looks that way. Why would I do that? I... Oh, my god. I have to get home. Whoa, whoa, whoa. I don't think it's a good idea for you to get behind the wheel right now. Why not? Listen. I'm an e.R. Doctor at the city hospital. My name's hugh. I've been trained to deal with this sort of thing. I know what it must look like, but I am not suicidal, okay? Then what were you doing up on the railing? I don't know. Okay, listen, maybe you were sleepwalking. I-I have no idea. You seem a bit confused, so please do us both a favor and let me give you a ride home. My car is right there. We can come back and get yours later. Okay, fine. Let's hurry. what the hell? are you sure this is your place? yes. I've got to see my daughter. Karen! Wait! -mom! -It's okay. I'm okay. Ms. Croft, I'm detective chandra, homicide. What are you doing here? What's going on? A few hours ago, your husband informed us that you were missing. After being made aware of certain statements that you made, we searched the property and discovered a body. What? She's a female, approximately 18 years of age. We found her hidden in your pool shed. gina navarro. What makes you think it's gina navarro, ms. Croft? I know she's missing. I saw the posters. A lot of people go missing. You said the victim was 18. Gina was 18. You seem to know an awful lot about her. I have a good memory. Do you remember this? I just keep strangling her. She tries to flee, but I'm stronger. I... I pick up the fire poker and... I hit her. Yes. In the head. As hard as I can. After that, you-you had a psychotic break a-and you ran off. I-I had to call them, karen. I was scared for you, for jordan. I would never hurt her! Don't touch her. Ms. Croft, I'm afraid you're going to have to come downtown with us. no. No, there must be... there must be a mistake! You can't take her! Jordan! No... My daughter. It's okay... It's okay. Like I said, I've been having visions of that woman. But I didn't even know her. I swear, it makes no sense. Your husband's recording suggests that they were more than just visions. Are you disputing dr. Gossett's statement that he found you preparing to jump off the north dam? No. You know, in my experience, a suicide attempt is usually a pretty good indication of a guilty conscience. You know, maybe you are just in denial about your part in gina's death. I swear to you, I have never had a suicidal thought in my life. There has to be something else going on here. thanks. Ms. Navarro's autopsy results and crime labs. Now, according to the m.E., the cause of death was blunt-force trauma to the head, and fingerprints were found on the plastic sheet that the body was wrapped in. Those fingerprints are yours. They're your fingerprints, ms. Croft. karen croft, you have the right to remain silent. Anything you say can be used against you in a court of law. You have the right at this time to talk to a lawyer and have your lawyer present with you while you are being questioned. If you cannot afford to hire a lawyer, one will be appointed to represent you before questioning if you wish. How are you holding up, karen? I've been better. Where's jordan? Well, we decided that bringing her here wasn't the best idea. Why not? Ms. Croft... You're looking at murder one. And with the dna evidence, it'll be a slam dunk. That's 25 to life. 25? we'll get you through it. Okay, we'll get you the help you need, but right now, we need to think about what's best for jordan. What's best for jordan is that her mother doesn't spend the rest of her life in prison. So what is our defense? An insanity plea? Non compos mentis, what? You're not insane, karen. How else do you explain why I killed a complete stranger? Ms. Croft, the police have a witness... a ms. Doreen wayne, your boss, I believe. She says she saw you arguing with the deceased the day she disappeared. What? You should know this isn't the first time she's acted like this. Otto... Years ago, my wife... Accused me of being unfaithful. That was a long time ago, and I was wrong. We had a fight... a big fight. You were violent. Who knows, maybe you killed this navarro woman out of some twisted notion of jealousy. Are you admitting you knew her? What? No! Of course not! And I didn't know the first one either. Damn it, karen! Why did you do this? Why did you do this to us? Otto, it's going to be all right. Don't do that. Don't tell me it's gonna be all right! My wife killed an 18-year-old girl. What were you thinking, karen? Dr. Croft, you need to get a hold of yourself, okay? -I'm sorry, I... -come on. Let's take a minute. I'll be right back. Just sit tight. remember. you did this. You buried me. I'm sorry. Don't worry about it. I can only imagine what you're going through right now. I'm sorry! karen? Are you feeling okay? Guard... Guard? guard! code red. In the visitors' center. I say again, we have a medical... did you see mom? Yeah, I did. How is she? When can I see her? Your mother's not in the right frame of mind for a visit right now. Dad... She didn't do it, she couldn't have. I'm as shocked by all of this as you are, but, sweetheart, the evidence, it's... It's overwhelming. No. It doesn't... It doesn't make sense. Why would she kill some random girl? I've been a psychiatrist 15 years, and even I can't answer that. Sometimes, people, they just... Snap. Look, she might be sick, but she's still your mom, okay? And she needs our support, if she's going to get better. I'll take you to visit her soon, okay? I promise. Okay? Come here. Dad? Yeah? Please, don't leave me, too. Hey. You listen to me. I'm not going anywhere, okay? I am not... Going anywhere. hang on. It's the lawyer. Yeah. What? her vital signs are stable. You're gonna be okay. Can you put my, uh, jacket over there, man? Please? Thanks. oh! don't worry. The building's not burning down. Well, that's too bad, because after what you've done to us, an insurance write-off would be a blessing. I need to know if you were telling the truth. When you said you saw me with gina navarro on the day she disappeared. I can't believe I almost made you partner. Damn it, doreen. I need to know. Okay, all right, just calm down. I was well into my third whiskey sour when I saw you on the news. I thought that if I could blame it all on one rogue employee, I could buy myself some time, maybe find some financing to keep us afloat. Wasn't my finest feat of rationalization. That's enough. Okay? I'm calling the cops, so you either kill me or you get the hell out of here! Tell me the truth! You owe me that much. I owe you? Ten years building this company, and it took you less than an hour to tear it down! I'll be lucky if I get off with 20. Don't you understand? I can't do that to jordan, not if there's a chance that this is all in my head. All in your head? They found her in your pool shed, karen! Look, I'm sorry, but I've got other employees to think of. If I go back on my statement now, you and I will be sharing a cell. You didn't really see us together, did you? I saw you googling her. And that's enough and I'm leaving. Let me go! doreen? mm-hmm. I'd love that. all right, I'll text you. don't wait too long. I won't. let's go. I don't want to be late for class. Have fun, you two. jordan. I'm really sorry about your mom. I can't imagine what you're going through. yeah, whatever. Are you sure you want to do this? I mean, we can totally skip. It's not like anyone would blame you. It's fine. Just drive. hello? Yes, speaking. Hang on. Slow down. I-I thought that she was still in jail. No, no. That's... That's not necessary. I'm just here alone and I... jesus. No, I... ...I'm fine. Yes, I'm sure. Thank you. Was that the police? Detective chandra. She says that you escaped custody. Technically, I escaped from an ambulance. Karen, this is insane. You can't be here. I saw doreen. She lied to the police. -Doreen? -Yeah. Her statement is the only thing that's tying me to gina, it's the only evidence of a motive. I'm gonna call the lawyer. She'll know how to handle this. Um, something happened with doreen. There was a fight. karen, what have you done? I... it was an accident, okay? I just... I wish I could remember. If I could just remember, then I wouldn't... okay. Hey, hey, hey. Calm down. You need to listen to me. You have to surrender. No. Yes. You have to, okay? It's the only way. Look, anything else, it just... It makes it worse for all of us. They won't listen to me, okay? It's her word against mine, and now she's gonna say that I attacked her to get her to change her story, and I can't go down that road. Just grab a seat, okay? I'm gonna get you some water. You just stay there. what is this? Work. Someone's got to keep the lights on around here. Drink up. "techniques for managing traumatic memories"? "hypnotic suggestions and free will"? Yes. You've seen that book on my desk a hundred times. You know what my practice involves. I guess I never thought about it before. Helping people get over horrible things that have happened to them. It's not just about getting them to talk, is it? Okay, you... you need to focus. This is not about me. It's... About what you've done. Okay, now just... Drink. What else do you do to them? How else do you manipulate them? It's the police. karen, no. Don't touch me! I didn't have a psychotic break, did I? It was a hypnotic suggestion. You made me drive to that bridge and you wanted me to jump off of it. Listen to yourself! What you're saying, what you're thinking, it's crazy. I'm not the one who knew gina. It was you, wasn't it? wow. Interesting hypothesis. Where'd you come up with that? While you were rotting in jail? Dr. Croft! It's the police! dr. Croft! Are you all right in there? Be right there! otto? Karen, I thought you weren't coming home till tomorrow. Who the hell is she? I'm his wife! you're married? okay, look. We're all adults here. "adults"? You selfish son of a bitch! You never told me that you were still married! how could you do this to us? To jordan? Okay, gina, I'm gonna have to ask you to go. Oh, damn right I'm going. hey, listen to me. You can't tell anyone, okay? You'll ruin my reputation. your reputation? Are you serious? you should've thought of that before you started sleeping with one of your patients! hey! Gina. What? no! God! What did you do? Karen, she gave us no choice. oh, my god. She's not breathing! Oh, my god. I'm calling the police. stop! Sorry, karen. I can't let you do that. oh, thank god, you're here. She just left. Who? Who the hell do you think? My wife! She attacked me! Go! open it. otto, please! Just do it. Get her in. wait. What are you gonna do? Make you forget what just happened. this is chandra. Karen croft has been spotted in the 600-block of ivers crescent. She should be considered armed and dangerous. All available units, please respond. where have you been? The police station. -We need to talk. -How long? How long what? How long have you been cheating on mom? Honey, I don't... don't even try and deny it. I saw you today with ruth. did you sleep with gina, too? What? No! I s... I had nothing to do with that woman. Then why would mom kill her? Okay, honey... don't. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I've let you down. I'm a better psychiatrist than I am a husband. I was... Unfaithful to your mother years ago. -I am so ashamed. -Yeah. The truth is, ever since she found out about my peccadilloes, she's been insanely jealous of other women, especially younger, attractive ones. So she just snapped and murdered her? I know, I know how bizarre it sounds, but, from your mother's perspective, it probably felt like the only choice. No. That's not mom. She... She couldn't do that! Trust me, it doesn't take much for the most stable, rational people to go off the rails. They're called "crimes of passion" for a reason. Look, honey. I know you're hurting, but there is a way to take all the pain, all those bad memories... ...And make it go away. How? You're gonna have to trust me. that was a nice save the other day, gossett. Remind me. The jumper on the dam. Ah. Karen. "karen"? She must've left quite an impression. you know... I don't think she actually wanted to jump. Why do you say that? The way she reacted when I found her. She was... Disoriented, confused. Said she didn't know how she had gotten there. Yeah, but they just found a body in her shed. I don't think she was exactly, you know, in a healthy frame of mind. Yeah... You know who her husband is, right? No. Who? Otto croft, the psychotherapist. I know, right? Imagine what he's going through right now. You know, I don't believe it. What? That she killed anyone. Is that what you told the police? Well, they didn't ask for my opinion. Just the facts, huh? you're such a boy scout. So coffee later? Oh, if I'm still awake. I'm coming up on 12 hours. All right, I hear you. Well, have a good one. Yeah, you too. chandra. Homicide. Detective. Hi. It's hugh gossett, your witness from the dam. Dr. Gossett. How can I help you? Something's been bothering me ever since the other night. I should have said something right away, but I got this idea in my head that I should only stick to what I actually saw. Now I'm worried there's a more important context here that might be overlooked. Is this about karen croft? Yes. I don't think she was actually trying to kill herself. So you think she wanted to be caught? No, that's not what I mean. Do you want to change your statement? No! Yes. I mean... Amend it, I guess. Sorry, I-I don't know the protocols for something like this. Well, how about you just tell me what's on your mind? When I got to her, she wasn't showing any signs of suicidal ideation. She wasn't crying, she didn't seem manic or depressed. She was just confused. I don't think she had any idea where she was or what she was doing on that ledge. Well, if that's true, then how did she get there? I don't know. All I'm saying is that she wasn't acting like someone with a free will, if that makes any sense. So... You're suggesting that she was, what, brainwashed? I know how that sounds, but this wasn't sleepwalking or a fight-or-flight response to trauma. I can't explain it, but I got a strong feeling something else is going on here. I see. Look, why don't you come down to the station tomorrow and we can talk about it some more? In the meantime, if your feelings turn into anything more concrete, just-just let me know. I appreciate the call, doc. Okay. Sure. karen? I'm gonna get in the car. If you try anything, I'll fry you. -Okay. -'kay. H-how did you find me? I thought I was the one with the bad memory. I told you I was a doctor here, didn't I? Bingo. I'd just like to point out that I did save your life at the dam. You told them I tried to commit suicide. Actually, I just described what I saw, and trust me, it didn't look good. My husband hypnotized me. Hypnotized you? I know how that sounds, but it's kind of his thing. He provides therapy to people with addictions. You're an addict? No. He had an affair. I found out about it, and then he killed her. It's complicated, okay? Yeah, I'm getting that. Turn the car on. now drive. Mind if I ask where we're going? My daughter's school. She's in danger. From her father? No, from the easter bunny. Yes, from her father. Drive! next practice will be Wednesday after school. The climate action group meets in mr. Scott's room at lunch. Hope to see you there. One thing to note, the announcement box is not in the library, it's in the office. If you've got requests, they go to... Hey. Look, I'm 18, okay? I know what I'm doing. Your dad's a good guy, and he's hurting. I just want to be there for him. This thing with your mom is a total bummer, but I don't understand why everyone has to suffer just because she's a psycho. So, are we... are we gonna have a problem, or what? No problem. Good. what now? Wait until school's out? You're gonna exit the car slowly and we're gonna go inside. Oh, yeah, not suspicious at all. Shut up. Now move. You're hurt. I'm fine. Let's go. Which way? Excuse me. Do you know jordan croft? Do you know where I can find jordan croft? Thanks. I don't think that disguise is working that well. Why don't you put the taser away and let me help you? No offense, but I trust you about as far as I can throw you. jordan. Jordan! It's me. It's mom. I'm-I'm not supposed to talk to you. Jordan, wait. You have to come with me right now. No. No, no, no, no. - jordan! - help me. Let her go. Ma'am, I'm school security. I know who you are. Please don't let her take me. My daughter doesn't know what she's saying right now. She's not in her right mind. No one's going anywhere, okay? We're just gonna wait here for the police. Jordan! Jordan... all right, you asked for it. Oh, hell. Stay down! nothing personal. trust me now? Let's go. where are we going now? Jordan, I am so sorry about all of this. Are you all right? Do you need anything? I'm fine. We'll let you get back to your classes in a minute. I just need to ask you a few questions about what happened, okay? She wants to hurt me. Who does? Your mother? Has she ever tried to do that before? "before"? Before gina navarro. Before the murder. Um... Jordan? Jordan! Oh, you poor thing. Come on. Let's get you home, where you'll be safe. Dr. Croft, I still need to ask her some more questions. No, what you need to do is find my wife! How the hell did she get loose in the first place? We are looking into that, but your daughter may be able to help us with the investigation. Are you kidding? Look at her. She is in a state of shock, okay? She's not helping anyone in this condition. If you need something from us, contact my lawyer. Come on. hey! Hey, are you guys okay? Yeah, she's fine. I've just gotta take her home. So, am I gonna see you later? Don't be stupid. Remember where you are. boss, there's something you need to see. This was shot by one of the students we interviewed. This is the two of them arriving at the gym together. that's our dam witness, hugh gossett. Yeah. See the body language? At first, he looks like a hostage, right? Check this out. geez. We're talking about some serious stockholm syndrome here. 'kay, put out a b.O.L.O. On gossett and get me his address. your house is huge. ah, I inherited it from my parents. My ex-girlfriend lived here for a couple of years. She left these. Your ex must be petite. sure she's not gonna want all this back? No. It's done. But I don't think that's the real issue right now, do you? all right, here's what you need to know. I saw my husband kill gina. He tried to erase my memories, but when they started to come back, he planted a hypnotic suggestion for me to kill myself, and then he called the police, knowing that they'd find the body and I would be the prime suspect. And now you think he's hypnotized jordan? You saw her back there. She was acting like she was on auto-pilot. Why would he even risk that? I mean, she's walking around in public, interacting with people. She must have found out something about him. Well, if he went through the trouble to hypnotize her, it must mean he's not prepared to hurt her. Yet. Whoa. Speaking of hurt... Let me take a look at that. It's not deep. Yeah. Doesn't mean it can't get infected. When's the last time you changed the bandage? Never? Come on. I'll get you cleaned up. Okay. You're a real pro at this. Ah, four years in the e.R. You must have seen everything, huh? thought I had. There, all done. Thanks. I really appreciate everything. Listen, karen. No more barging into schools to kidnap girls, okay? We need to be smarter about this. You don't need to worry about it. I can handle things on my own from here on out. What do you mean? I mean, I've already gotten you too involved in this. Hey, if I didn't want to be here, I wouldn't have tackled the security guard. I wasn't intimidating enough, huh? Yeah, sorry to burst your bad-ass bubble, but yeah... I didn't actually think you were going to tase me. Sorry about that. forget about it. It's in the past. Well, I should go. Okay. What's the plan? Find out a way to prove that otto's lying. Any ideas? I'll figure out something. take the back. I got the front. Karen, "I'll figure something out" is not a plan. Well, it's all I've got. You've got me. Listen. When I talked you down off that ledge, that wasn't just being a good samaritan. The truth is, I thought you were one of the most beautiful women I'd ever seen and I... hey. I'm baring my soul here. Give me a break. Look... I like you, too. Really. I just can't think about this stuff right now. I totally understand. You have your daughter to worry about. And a murderer for a husband. Yeah. hugh gossett! It's the police! Open the door! now we're both fugitives on the run. -You need to give yourself up. -What? Just tell them that I made you to do it. It's the truth. After what I did to the guard? They'll never buy it. Damn it, hugh. I don't want you to ruin your life over this. Hey. You let me worry about that. You got enough on your plate. What happened to "we barely know each other"? I know enough. Come on. they must have just left. Spread out and find them. damn it. I left my keys in inside. Got any other ideas? Working in an e.R. Doesn't really prepare you for running from the cops. Yeah, neither does being a c.P.A. You're an accountant? I was. For a design firm. If we get out of this, you're doing my taxes. Sure, why not? Here. I have an idea. Come on. We're stealing cars now? That's worse than your last plan. What, do you want to take another hostage? this whole bonnie-and-clyde thing is definitely not as glamorous as it looks in the movies. Okay, what now? I don't know. This was your idea! I've never hot-wired anything before, okay? Neither have I! What are you doing? Well, back in high school, the shop kids used to do this all the time, and they weren't exactly honor-roll material. How hard can it be? ah! Harder than it looks? Nothing yet. Keep looking. They couldn't have gone far. I've got a visual on the suspect. Police! Get out of the car. Karen, this is crazy. We've got nowhere to go. Damn it! It's push start. karen! That's not the way to get your daughter back. If I give up now, it's over, otto wins. What are you talking about? There's no time. My daughter is in danger. Karen! suspect on the move! do you trust me, jordan? Yes. Good. I'm glad, because you're my daughter and I would never hurt you. I know. When we're done here, everything that's troubled you these last few days will be gone. We can start again with a clean slate. hold that thought in your mind. Cherish it. Honey, I... I never want you to doubt that I love you... And that I'll always have your best interests at heart. I know. Ruth, what the hell are you doing? What am I doing? What are you doing? My job! I'm a psychiatrist. My daughter needs treatment. With a gun? I knew something was up with her. Something is up with her. She's suffered a severe trauma. And hypnotizing her is gonna help? Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize that there were two doctors in the room. Turn it off. She's coming with me. Ruth, let's just down the... turn it off! Fine. Take it easy. jordan... Come on. Get up, jordan. Are you okay? Yes. See? I told you. She is here of her own free will. Isn't that right, jordan? You haven't really thought this through, have you, ruth? Tell me, what do you think is gonna happen next? Stay back. We're getting a second opinion. Good one. Jordan, honey? Get me the gun. Jordan... Jordan! You know, they might not admit it... But most people want to be told what to do. I simply implanted the suggestion that my voice and god's were one and the same. Is that what you did to your wife? Is is what you're gonna make me do? Jump off a bridge? I don't think so. Coincidences like that tend to make the police nervous. But then again, I can't just let you go, can I? Jordan, please, come on. You don't want to do this. You know, I never meant to hurt anyone. I really didn't. But, first, karen forced me into it, and now you. I guess I'm just attracted to the wrong women. You can go to hell, you creep! Jordan, grab her. No, jordan, don't... all right... Let's move her. hello? Dr. Bridges? This is detective chandra, metro pd. I'm calling about a dr. Otto croft. Now, I understand that you were the head of the psychiatric department at county general during his residency there. That's correct. Is this about what happened with his wife? Because I saw that on the news and that's terrible business. It is. Do you have time to answer some questions? Of course. But I should tell you, I've never met mrs. Croft. It's not her that I'm interested in. Oh? I see. Can you tell me what you know about dr. Croft's practice? I know that he is a very successful psychotherapist. That's right, and did you know that he uses hypnosis as a major component of his treatment? No, I didn't, but that is a very accepted part of cognitive behavioral therapy. Do you have any expertise in that area? Expertise? No. I've always felt hypnosis to be more of an art than a science. Hmm. So you think it's bunk? Not at all. It can be a very powerful tool, but the effects sometimes are... Unpredictable. Detective, what is this about? I'm just chasing down a hunch. Well, reading between the lines, it sounds like you believe that someone involved in this case was hypnotized. Hmm. You see right through me. Now, tell me, is it possible for a person to be hypnotized against their will? No. But a skilled hypnotist could make someone do things that would otherwise be outside of their nature? Well, that is the goal of guided hypnotherapy. Freeing a patient from bad habits, addictions, and so on. And what about self-harm? Could someone be hypnotized to commit suicide? As I said, I am no expert... But there have been cases where deaths have been attributed to bungled hypnosis, if not outright malfeasance. So the answer is "yes." a qualified one, sure. What about murder? Detective, are you suggesting that dr. Croft might be involved in the death of that poor woman? Well, like I said, I'm just pursuing a hunch to see where it leads. It sounds like you have all your answers. You know what? I think I do, too. Thank you for your time, doctor. I appreciate it. that's ruth's car. who's ruth? My daughter's best friend. I think she's having an affair with otto. Isn't that a bit of a leap? She's the same age as gina navarro. Ah. She was flirting with him right in front of me. Okay. So how do you want to do this? You distract him, I'll go get the girls out of there. How do you want me to distract him? I have an idea, but I'm not sure it will work. Why not? Because he has to believe that you'd sell me out. In senior year, I played iago in othello. Reviews said I was the best thing in it. Wow, that's dark. That's what I was hoping for. How good is the mic on your phone? Um... I don't know, I've never used it before. Why? Because you have to get him talking. We need him to incriminate himself. Right. Can you do this, hugh? Yeah. I think so. Thank you. get the door. come on. Help me get her in the chair. stay here. What do you want? Just a moment of your time, doc. Look, whatever you're selling, I'm not interested. Don't you remember me? I met your wife on the dam. Right! Yes. You're, uh, you're that witness. Uh, gosling or godfrey or... gossett. Hugh gossett. Yes. How can I help, mr. Gossett? It's not what you can do for me, doc. It's what I can do for you. After you. wow. Nice place. I didn't really get a chance to look around last time I was here. Yeah, listen, I'm a pretty busy man, mr. Gossett. I'd appreciate it if you just got to the point. I'm sure the cops told you your wife flew the coop. I'm aware, yeah. What do you know about it? Well, for a while there, I was her hostage. That was fun. Wow! Nice pool. I'll bet they charged an arm and a leg for all this, huh? Listen, if you know where my wife is, you should really tell the police. I could. Do the right thing, be a hero, all that stuff. But I don't think it'd be very good for you. For me? Oh, well, all I want is for karen to get the help that she needs. what's so funny? You. The "upstanding citizen" act. I'm have no idea what you mean. Your wife's had total recall, doc. She remembers everything. what exactly did she tell you? Oh, you know... About discovering the affair. About you killing gina to cover it up, and then juicing her to erase her memory. It's quite a story. If I were you, I wouldn't want her blabbing it to the cops. That is quite the story. But the police didn't believe her the first time, why would they believe her now? Yeah, maybe they'd believe her, maybe they wouldn't. Either way, I'd bet you'd sleep better at night if you could just get rid of her and blame it on someone else. Just like you did with gina. And it seems to me that being able to make that happen should be worth something. okay. Oh, let me see if I got this straight. You think that I killed gina navarro, and now you're here to, what? To blackmail me? Come on. It's not like you can't afford it. Look at this place. What's a million or so to a guy like you? Not much. Ooh. What is this? That's... Not what it looks like. Really? Pretty sure it is. jordan? Come out here, sweetie. jordan? Ruth? Ruth! Wake up. Ms. Croft! did my husband do this to you? Yeah. He made jordan help. Something's not right about her. She's not herself. You're telling me. Otto, he... he's crazy. I... I think he killed that woman. I know. I'm going to handle it. You need to get out of here and call the police. Can you do that? Yeah. I owe you a really big apology. I did something really stupid. I understand. I fell for him, too. Come on. -Get out of here. -Okay. does she really need to see this? See this? She's gonna do it. Jordan, honey, we're gonna play a little game. I'm gonna count down from five, and when I get to one, I want you to shoot this man. Now, don't worry... The bullets aren't real. No one's actually gonna get hurt. Take it. Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute. Five. Where's my wife? Mr. Gossett? You can't seriously expect to get away with this. four. I think I'm doing pretty good so far. Three. Where is she? As far away from you as possible. Two, one. Now. you did good, sweetheart. You did so, so good. The game is not over yet. Okay? In a minute, I want you go into my counseling room and I want you to shoot your friend, ruth. Okay, and then after that... I want you to shoot yourself. Now, again, remember, it's just a game. No one will get hurt. You understand? Yes. Good girl. I love you, sweetie. Now go. Now. jordan? It's me. Mom. can you hear me, jordan? Follow my voice, jordan. Jordan? Mom? -Mom! -Honey. What happened? Where am I? You're home, baby. You're home. I think I shot someone. jordan? Why don't I hear any gunshots? well, look at you go, mr. Gossett! impressive. please... Don't hurt them. Shut up. hi, honey. whoa, whoa. Just take it easy. "take it easy"? After everything you've done, you want me to take it easy? Think about your daughter. Our... our daughter. Do it, mom. Kill him. No. Honey, you don't... You don't mean that. You're confused, okay, sweetheart? You... -you son of a bitch! You made me shoot him! jordan, no! No, no. you're both crazy! ho! Thank god, you're here. Dr. Croft, I need you to stay where you are. My wife, she's inside. She's got my daughter and she's already shot a man. I don't even know what she's gonna do next! I said, stop moving! didn't you hear what I said? My daughter is a hostage. I heard you. What the hell are you doing? watch him. Watch me? Are you crazy? Karen! This is detective chandra. I need you to come out of the house with your hands where I can see them. What do we do? Exactly what she says. No, I'm not letting him get away with this! Jordan! Jordan, wait. On the ground, now! Hands behind your head. My mom didn't do anything. It was all my dad. Don't listen to her! My wife, she-she's working with that witness, gossett, they came here to extort me, and then we fought, and-and she tried to shoot me, and she shot him instead. Get rid of him. What? that's not what happened! Jordan, honey, it's okay, just get down. Do what they say. It's not right, we can't just let him get away with this. -It's okay. -Ms. Croft. Is there anyone else in the house? Hugh gossett. He's been shot. Search it. Did it happen like your husband said? No. Then who pulled the trigger? I did. No, no, no, no, no. She's lying. It was me. I-I... I was... I was hypnotized. I didn't... I didn't mean to. I swear. I didn't mean to kill him. We're all gonna head down to the station. we have an injured man here. We need an ambulance, stat. Did he just say injured? He's alive. hey. How are you? Healing. Still sore? Oh... No complaints. So how's my best buddy, otto? cooling his heels in jail. Nice view. Yeah. From this side. And to think this is where we first met. Crazy, huh? You took a bullet for jordan and I. Yeah... Guess I did, didn't I? So... Does that get me a date? Or a dinner, maybe? I'll take that a yes. I'm buying. oh! Okay.
