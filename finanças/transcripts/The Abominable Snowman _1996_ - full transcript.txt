(dramatic music) (gentle ambient music) - Move it, move it, come on, move it, move it. Let's go. (wind blowing) (dramatic music) (Linda yelps) - Linda's gone down. (suspenseful music) (Linda grunts) She went over here! (Linda grunting) - [Skully] Let's go. All right, we got her. She's okay. - [Bobby] Oh, okay, she's okay. I think she's okay. - The party's over. Let's move it. (fire crackles) (crickets chirping) - [Linda] This is crazy. - Relax, you're not that bad. Besides, you'll have me on your right and nature boy here on your left. Isn't that right, Vince? - Yeah, right. You ain't heavy. You're my mother. - Well, I sure as hell ain't gettin' heavy eatin' this crap. When I signed on for this here little old picnic, I thought I was in for some fun. Know what I'm sayin'? So far, all I've had is work, work, work and instant package shit. For the price I've paid for this here death march, I coulda bought me this skyline lodge overlookin' the Shenandoah Valley. Hey, you ever hiked the A.T.? Hello? Now that's the Appalachian Trail to all you Yankees. And I'll tell ya, I wish to hell I was there right now. Hey! How much further is it to the top of this thing? Or do you even know? - [Skully] You throw away food again and I'm gonna dropkick your ass off this mountain. (ominous screeching) - What was that? A wolf? (ominous screeching) (suspenseful music) - Hey. I don't need this. - You said you wanted excitement. All right, best we pack up in case a quick departure. We'll take shifts standing guard while the others sleep. Robert E Lee, you're on deck first. You see something, you holler. (dramatic suspenseful music) (tense ambient music) I'm gonna make some serious time, scout out the area ahead. You boys follow my footprints. Try to stay in line. - I'll tell ya'll one thing, when I get on back to Charlottesville, I'm gonna get me the biggest plate of honey baked ham you ever did see followed by one man-sized portion of blackberry pie a la mode. (chuckles) - I wish you were there too. - So do I. 'Cause, you see, it sure as hell beats tryin' to converse with some freako from New York who don't even eat meat. (laughs) (Bobby shouts) Hey, you boys oughta try this. (Bobby screams) - I trust this has no relationship to that thing we heard howling last night. - We'd just be crazier than a bitch in heat to stick around here and find out. I say we just get on back down to civilization pronto. (ominous screeching) - For once, I agree with you. - Come on, man, we just can't leave him here. - Why not? - Somebody somewhere wants to know where this person is. Besides, it's only gonna take a minute to dig him up and maybe get him down the mountain. - Well, fine, but let's just do this another time, like next Fourth of July. - Hey, lighten up, man, and besides, we have to wait for Skully. - He'll find his way back down. - Skully. Skully! - Oh, just give it up, man. He can't hear you, he's too far outta range. - Vince, want do you think? - Survival has always been one of my top priorities. I think we should talk to Skully. - Oh, bullshit. I am walkin'. - Hey, what's another 20 minutes? - (mumbles) in death. There's a blizzard coming. If we're not outta here soon, we'll wind up worse than that Popsicle. (tense ambient music) Come on. Let's be quick. (wind blowing) (plane rumbling) - [Linda] Hey, they found us! They found us! Oh, they found us! - Hey, hey, over here! - We're over here! - [Bobby] Over here, hey, hey! (explosion booms) - All right, move out. (wind blowing) (radio crackles) Hello, hello? Hello, can anyone hear me? Can anyone hear me? Damn thing's not working. - [Vince] Let me take a look. - Save your breath. We're not going anywhere for a while. - We gotta get help. We've gotta do something about that rescue plane. - That was no rescue plane. No one knows we're out here. You signed on for a course in outdoor survival, a course designed to test your skills to the limits. Now it wouldn't be much if we had a babysitter lookin' out for us. Besides, whatever that plane was, it went down. No one coulda survived that crash. - Well, maybe there's a radio on that plane that really works. Besides, somebody's gotta be lookin' for them, and if they find them, maybe they'll find us. - The blizzard will kill us first. - Maybe so, but there still could be people alive. I'm going. - [Vince] Let's go. - The three of us will go. The rest of you stay put. If we're not back by sundown... (wind blowing) - [Stave] This way, Skully! - [Vince] Hey, Skully! Where the hell you going? It's over here. - Over this way. - This way. - Come on. - Come on over here. (tense ambient music) Hey, it's over there. Over here, Skully! - [Vince] Come on, let's get 'em out, it's gonna blow. - [Skully] All right, watch it. (metal clanging) (glass tinkles) Pilot's dead. Okay, this one's alive. I got him, I got him. - What about the radio? - You check it out. I'm outta here. All right, let's go, let's move it. - No, no, my-- - [Stave] Come on, come on, it's too late. - [Skully] Come on, get him outta there! - [Stave] It's too late for that. - [Vince] You okay? - Yeah, yeah, I'm okay. (explosion booms) (Vince and Julie scream) (tense ambient music) - [Stave] Vince, are you all right? - [Skully] Is everybody all right? - [Stave] Vince! - I'll be okay. - [Terry] Hey, what happened? Is everything okay? - I thought you guys were never gonna make it back. - [Stave] Vince, are you gonna be okay? - [Vince] Nothing a couple Tylenols wouldn't cure. - This is no good. I've never seen anything like it. - What are we gonna do? - We gotta get outta here, that's what. This thing has shifted fast. - These people are hurt, man. - We got no choice. Now I want each of you to take a piece of this rope, tie it to yourself, then tie it to the guy behind ya. We're gonna make a chain and we're gonna march on outta here. I know a place over on the other side. - [Stave] I don't think they can make it. - [Skully] They make it if they can. You got a problem with that? - We can make it. Just give me some rope. - Well, then what's holdin' us back? (tense ambient music) (Julie grunts) - [Julie] I can't make it. - [Stave] Come on, come on! (wind blowing) - [Skully] Damn. (metal clanking) - [Vince] Come on, Skully, stop messin' around. (tense ambient music) (flare hisses) - [Skully] All right, let's go see what we got here. (wood clatters) - [Bobby] Hey, hey, lookie here. It's an old lantern, and there's still some kerosene in it too. - Sorry about the pilot. Was he a close friend of yours? - No. We didn't really know him. We just hired him to fly the plane. - Hey, where's Linda? Anyone know? She was tied to you. What happened? - I don't know. She was there when we all started running. Guess she must've broken off or something. - Way to go, bubba. - Hey, leave him alone, it's not his fault. We oughta go find her. - She ain't here now, she ain't gonna be later. - Hey, it's worth a try, Skully. I thought you were supposed to be taking care of us. - That's right. I'm also the one who makes the calls. Now you do as I say and everyone's gonna live a whole lot longer. - Well, I think we oughta go find her. - Go ahead. Just make sure you close the door on the way out. Anyone else wanna go? That's just what I thought. So be it. Now I want everybody to put all the food and supplies on the table so we can see just what we got. (foreboding ambient music) (wind blowing) - You okay? - I'm fine. I'm feeling much better now. - Damn. - Take it easy, man. Linda wasn't your responsibility. It coulda happened to anyone of us. - I'm sorry. I didn't know. - Here's some water. - Well, what are you people doing out here? - Well, my father and I were on-- - A study mission, an in depth study mission, gentlemen. I'm a professor at the University of Washington on a study for precious minerals in the north country. My name incidentally is Dr. William Peterson and this is my daughter and assistant Dr. Julie Peterson. - University of Washington. Say, isn't that where the Huskies play? (Skully snaps his fingers) What? - Shut up. All right, it's probably just the wind. But I'm gonna go check it out. Now it's best that you people just stay put. - (clears throat) Okay. I'm Thomas Stave, biology teacher, Seneca Valley High School, Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. The guy outside looking for Linda is Vince. This is Terry, and that's Bobby, one of the original descendants of the Battle of Bull Run. Believe it or not, we're on a two week survival outing. In case you haven't noticed, Skully's in charge here. - Somehow we did get that impression. (wind blowing) (grunting) (ominous screeching) (tense ambient music) (chuckles) - Hey, how long is this shit supposed to last? I'm so damn hungry I could even eat a hunk of Yankee pot roast. - Keep your grubby hands off. I'll tell you what you can eat and when. - I'm cold, man! Can't we build a fire? - [Skully] Yeah? And smoke us all out? - Yeah, well, maybe we should search the place. Who knows, maybe we'll find some food. - Yeah, maybe. So what kinda precious minerals you say you're looking for up here? - We didn't say, actually. But now that you ask, uranium. (Skully chuckles) - Uranium? Up here? - Yes, that's correct. - Well, everybody knows the only thing up here is rocks and snow. - Oh? Sounds like you spend a great deal of time up here, Mr. Skully. (metal clangs) - [Stave] Vince! Come on. Over here, over here. - Nothing. - Here, take a hit, man, you need it. - So how far out did you go? - No idea. I could've been walkin' around in circles for all I know. - That's strange. The last time I saw Linda, she wasn't 30 feet from this building. - If she was out there, I'd've found her. - Unless something found her first. (wrapper crinkling) - No! (tense ambient music) Son of a bitch. - No! - Hayseed, you're starting to wear my patience very thin. - Go ahead. Shoot me. I'm sick of this. I'm sick of all of you! (Julie screams) - [Julie] No, Scully! - No! - [Julie] Put it down. - Skully, put it down. - [Julie] Skully, no! - Put it down! - [Julie] No! - [Stave] Put it down, man, put it down. (Bobby shouts) (crashing) - [Skully] Fire! - [Stave] Watch out. (Skully grunting) (dramatic ambient music) - I'm sorry, man. He just... - Save it for later, Bobby. - Somebody get me some water. - You know, maybe that idea of looking for food isn't such a bad one right now. So, how long were you in the bush? 'Nam, man. I saw the scars on your back. Looks like you have a pretty rough go. - Ain't no rougher than anybody else. Besides, somebody had to go. (suspenseful ambient music) - Couldn't find a goddamn thing. - Yeah, well, things could get a lot worse. (rumbling) (Julie gasps) - Okay, everybody stay put. Make sure the shutter's secure. Come on. (suspenseful ambient music) (glass shatters) (Bobby screams) (rumbling) - It's getting closer to the door. - [Vince] Shoot, Skully, shoot. (gun fires) - No, no, no, don't shoot! (loud bang) (Linda screaming) - [Stave] Linda! Hold still. - Get a grip on her. - [Stave] Please, please. - Somebody help her. (Linda groans) - [Stave] Her tongue's been cut off. - [William] I think she's hallucinating. Get me a bandage, quickly. We need to apply pressure to the severed area. Bandage. Hold her head forward to keep-- - Who woulda done that? - Maybe she bit it off herself. Maybe she saw something so... She did it herself. Skully. What the hell is going on here? - You won't believe me if I told you. - Maybe you better try. Now what is out there? - Evil's out there. Incarnation of evil. I killed its mate and then I killed its baby. - No. - And it let out its rage and now is stalking us, waiting for the right time. - This is not happenin'. Somebody tell me this is not happenin'. - Skully, either you're completely out of your mind or this whole world has become totally screwed up. - Yes. It has. - Well, let's just get the hell outta here now, storm or not. It's better than sittin' around, waiting for the damn thing. - No, no, that's what it wants. It wants us to leave. We're easy targets that way. I mean, eventually, we're gonna have to leave, once the food runs out. - That's like saying damned if we do and damned if we don't. - Not if we get it first. - It, what the fuck is it? - All right, all right. Let's not get carried away here now. I mean, the storm'll be over soon, we'll get the radio to work, and then we can get some help. Tidy things up around here, bide our time. That oughta do the trick, huh, doc? That guy's really out there, isn't he? - Perhaps. But I'm afraid there is a little truth in his words. If this is something out there and it's a waiting game that we're to play, we just might not be the victors. - Bullshit! I say we charge down that mountain as fast as our legs will take us. - Go ahead. Be my guest. I'll kill the first guy who tries to stop you. - That's just what you want, isn't it? Me gettin' killed alone out there. - Come on, fighting among ourselves isn't gonna get us anywhere. Besides, it's gettin' dark. Let's barricade this place and get some sleep and talk about it in the morning. I know we got enough food to last 'til then. Why don't you go over and talk to her? - I'm going to, later. - Shy boy. (soft harmonica music) - Cut it out, Bobby. - Music hater. (soft harmonica music) (yawns) (ominous screeching) - This can't be happening to me. - [Skully] What the hell's goin' on? What are you doing? What the hell are you doing? - What's goin' on? - The food's missing. - [Vince] What do you mean the food's missing? - I didn't see anything. - You didn't see nothing, lightweight, 'cause you was too busy copping Zs. (tense ambient music) - I'm sorry. - Window's been played with. - What? - This has to be an explanation for this. - Nah, nah, nah, the only explanation here is that Sleepin' Beauty couldn't keep his damn eyes open. - Leave him alone. - Aw, well, lookie here. Little lady's maternal instincts are startin' to come out. - Watch it, Bobby. - [Stave] Come on out here quick! - [Bobby] Jesus H Christ, look at the size of them suckers. Oh my God. - Wait a second. There's none goin' back out. - [Julie] Oh, geez. - Hey, shut up. - That thing is in here. - [Skully] For God's sake. - Dad. Look at that. - Julie, it's what we've been searching for. (wind blowing) (soft tense ambient music) - Okay, folks, now listen up and listen up good. Time has come for us to go on a little huntin' party. We're gonna break into groups, scout this place out. Stave, you and Vince are together. I'll take Bobby. The rest of you people stay put. - A huntin' party? What are we huntin' for? - Anything that moves. - So what are we supposed to use for weapons? - Where'd you get those? - Found 'em in the back. You point this baby in the right direction, it'll do the trick. - No one saw 'em when we were lookin' for food. - Yeah? Well, you're lucky I did. - I'm coming. - Better stay put, Terry. - I'm coming. I'm coming. - Okay. But you stick with Stave and Vince. (gun clicks) (tense ambient music) - This is crazy. Are you really gonna use that thing? - For some reason, if something should happen, could you send this to the address inside? - I didn't know you were married. - I'm not. - So what are we supposed to do if there is some sort of superhuman beast in here? Shoot it? And then eat the monster meat? (both laugh) - Maybe you. I'm a vegetarian. (both laugh) - Mr. Skully, if what you say is true about this creature and all, perhaps you should try to capture it. - Not a chance, gramps. - Guns, Skully? Does it always have to be guns? - It's either him or us, and I'm countin' on us. - Well, maybe the thing is friendly. Did you ever think about that? - Yes, it might be able to help us. Sometimes things aren't always what they seem, Skully. Just think about it. This creature could be-- - [Julie] Hey! - This creature could be useful. - [Skully] (laughs) You gotta be out of your freakin' mind. - Father, are you all right? - Yeah, don't worry. - That was uncalled for, mister. - Well, it's best that you and gramps stay in the background there, sweetheart. - Don't call me sweetheart. And this happens to be Dr. William Peterson, an internationally acclaimed scientist. - Yeah? Well, sweetheart, right now that don't mean shit to a tree. Now you people stay put because I don't wanna have to bury anybody when I get back. (wind blowing) Stave. You, Vince, and Terry go that way. Talk to me with your headset and let me know what you see. Bobby, let's do it. (suspenseful ambient music) - [Julie] Oh, I don't like this. I wish we knew what was happening. - Sweetheart, we could probably listen in on that headset. Okay. - [Skully] It's dark down here. Keep your eyes open. Talk to me if you see something. Talk to me if you see something. - [Stave] Ah, it's dark down here. Gimme one of those flares. (flare hisses) God, you can't see anything here. (tense ambient music) Terry, are you all right? - [Vince] Hey, what's that? - [Stave] What? Hey, listen, if we ever get outta this alive, I'm sellin' this to CNN. - [Vince] I'll do the video, how to stalk Bigfoot in five easy lessons. If he doesn't get us first. - [Stave] Hey, not funny. - You go ahead, I'll cover ya. - No way. - You go ahead. - Okay. (suspenseful ambient music) - [Skully] Talk to me, what do you see? - Nothing yet. - [Skully] Okay, stay alert. Let's try the next one, come on. - [Bobby] Do we have to? - [Skully] We're going to the next level. - [Vince] What's up? - Methane gas. Better douse this flare. - Oh, Jesus! Did you hear that? Skully? Skully. Skully. Skully! Skully. Skully. Where the hell are you, man? Skull. Skully! You ain't nothing but a Yankee lowlife. Hey, guys, hello? Hello? Oh, Jesus. Damn it. Damn it. (deep growling) (Bobby screams) (flare hisses) (explosion booms) Oh! - Oh. - Hey, let's go this way. (tense ambient music) (Bobby whimpers) - You guys all right? (Bobby whimpers) - What's happening? - [William] Let me have a listen. (gun firing) - You bastard. You used me for bait! - [Skully] Yeah, well, I can't think of anything else you're good for. (creature growls) (wind blowing) - Hey. - Whatever it was, it's gone now. (tense ambient music) What is it, Jerry, what do you see? - Come on, Jerry, what's out there? - Wendy? I'm here! - Take it easy, man, you're seein' things. - Wait! - [Both] Terry! - [Vince] Come on back! - Terry! - Terry! - Wait, I'm here! (Terry gasps and pants) (creature growls) (Terry whimpers) - Terry! (Terry screams) - [William] My God. (heavy dramatic music) - Believe me now? - Senseless, it's just so senseless. - What are we gonna do? - We must talk to it, that's what. Now we must go on with our own plans at all costs. Not let anything stop us. Leeave everything to me, my dear. I think I can handle these people. (wind blowing) What is it about man that makes him want to destroy anything that he doesn't understand? Fear, ignorance, intolerance? Or just plain stupidity. - I'd say all of the above. - Precisely. Man's a flawed creature who wants his own way, regardless of the cost, regardless of the reward. - Better spit it out, gramps. I'm losing patience quickly. - And so am I, and don't call me gramps anymore. This whole thing's a sham, isn't it, Skully? This never was a real survival outing, was it? You just brought everyone up here to help you. - Well, that hardly matters now. - Enough of this ping-pong talk. Would somebody mind just tellin' me what the hell that thing was I saw out there? What was it, some sorta missing link or extraterrestrial or what? - I told ya, evil. - Yes, evil, but our evil, our sins. Maybe it's just some helpless species, just like us, trapped in the snow. - What exactly are you trying to say, doc? - What I'm saying is we must try to communicate with this creature. For the love of God, gentlemen, science and mankind demand to know. - Not if I have anything to say about it. I've seen what your mankind has become. Parasites, carrier of AIDS, children screaming for a bowl of milk. (gun clicks) This creature is a goner. - No, no, no, you can't do that. I won't allow it. (tense ambient music) - Stop it! Skully, you can't treat him like this. - You spoke your piece. Now shut up. That goes for all of ya. - I'm sorry, doc, but this time he may be right. Bobby, you got a look at it. Is it something we can communicate with? - Now that depends on if you speak monster or not. That sumbitch is definitely late night entertainment. - [William] Yes, but what we have to do is... - Thank you. - [Vince] How ya doing? - Fine. Considering. - Considering? - (laughs) I don't think I've ever been this hungry before. - Sometimes fasting's good. - [Julie] Oh? - Gives you something to do when you don't have anything to eat. (both chuckle) You really admire your father a lot. - Yeah. Oh, you don't know the half of it. He's dedicated his entire life to doing what's right. (light cheerful ambient music) - [Vince] I bet you have too. - Not really. (ominous screeching) It sounds like the loneliest thing in the world. - I wonder. I just want you to know I'm on your side. - Thank you. - [Skully] All right, let's get some shut-eye. - I'm really startin' to hate that guy. - We'll talk it, yes, but perhaps even better, we'll make a whole lot a money doing so. - I'm not with you, doc. - We'll bring the creature back. Can you imagine how much money the public would pay to see something like that? It'll be a goldmine, and we'll be partners all the way down the line. - Pardon me, but this doesn't sound like you. - Oh, I'm sick and tired of begging the government for grants. I wanna make some real money, and this way we can, if you'll trust me and help me. - What about Julie, does she agree with this? - She's young and naive and idealistic. What she doesn't know certainly won't hurt her. You like her, don't you, Vince? Help me on this, and I'll instruct her to be very nice to you. She'll do anything I say, I promise. Gentlemen, we can't let this opportunity slip away. - I'm gonna pretend I didn't hear that. - You know, you sound crazy. Desperate and crazy. Now I think you oughta get some sleep and forget all this crazy talk. - Just think about it, please. Just think about it. It's the only way when you think about it. (wind blowing) (tense ambient music) (wind blowing) - Father! Father! Father! Father! Father! Father, what are you doing? - [William] I must talk to it, Julie. - No. - [William] Before the others get to it. It's my opportunity. (creature growls) - Oh my God. - Please, please, don't hurt us. We're friends. Friends, friends. (tense ambient music) (gun fires) - Father! (creature growls) (Julie screams) (tense ambient music) - We gotta find Julie. - What do you think this is all about? Hand me that one in the corner. - You think that'll do it? - Don't worry, this baby'll do the damage. - Just remember, Julie can't get hurt. - Buddy, leave it to me. - That's what I'm worried about, buddy. - First light, we go, all of us. (light ambient music) (tense ambient music) (wind blowing) (tense ambient music) (creature growls) (creature growls) - Hey, I gotta eat, man. I'm starvin'. I'm really starvin'. Huh? Please. - Jesus went for 40 days without food or water. Now I think you can last one more day. I'm gonna take a look around the building. You guys hold down the fort. - Yeah. - [Bobby] Yeah, right. - Skully, he's tough. - I thought I told you to stay put. Want some? Hungry? Take some. But you can't tell anybody else. Okay. Don't take anything. But anybody should find out about this... (imitates gun firing) (wind blowing) (tense ambient music) (creature growls) (creature growls) (creature growls) (gentle ambient music) - It's over, the storm's over, we can go home. Huh? The storm's over. We can go home now. - We're not going anywhere 'til we get it. Besides, we need food, nourishment. We'll soon find some up above, after we take care of business. - Yeah, well, maybe the radio will work now and we can call for help. - Forget it, pal. - Hey, it's worth a try, Skully. Nice going, Skully. - Nothing can stop us now. - I say we go down anyway. - We can't leave Julie. - That's right. We can't leave Julie. (wind blowing) (tense ambient music) (creature growls) (Julie gasps) (Julie screams) (resolute ambient music) (ominous screeching) (birds twittering) (Skully laughs) Throw a strike between its eyes. Then you'll see some fireworks. (laughs) Let's move out. (tense ambient music) - There's not a mark on him. - The devil works in many strange ways. Let's go. We'll bury him later. These are fresh. He's out there. We're gettin' close. Let's go huntin', boys. Follow me and I'll take you to the Promised Land. (tense ambient music) Let us pray. Lord, please guide us in what we are about to do. Give us strength if we are to fight evil and help us to do Thy will. In Your name, amen. Okay, now listen up. We're gonna divide up into two groups, we're gonna circle behind him, then we're gonna drop in a couple of these babies. - Hey! You said Julie wouldn't get hurt. - Trust me, she won't. Stave, take Vince and Linda, go up the hill. Bobby, you're with me. - Not this time, bubba. - Fine. Have it your way. (tense ambient music) (gun clicks) (creature roars) (gun clicks) - Skully, you bastard! (creature grunts) Julie! (tense dramatic music) - It's okay, Vince! He won't hurt me. - Vince, outta the way! (creature roars) - Come on, baby, come on. Come on. - No, Stave, just go away! Just turn around and go away! (tense ambient music) (creature grunts) (Skully laughs) - I've waited 10 long years for this. (gun fires) (creature grunts) - [Stave] No. - [Julie] No, no! No, Skully, let him live. (tense dramatic music) (creature grunting) - The Lord giveth, and the Lord taketh away. (gun clicks) (creature grunts) (loud growling) (Julie grunts and shouts) (Skully screams) (creature grunting) (somber string music) (Julie sobs) (helicopter rumbling) (resolute ambient music) (helicopter rumbling) - Thank God. (dramatic orchestral music)
