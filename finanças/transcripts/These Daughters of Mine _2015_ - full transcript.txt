THESE DAUGHTERS OF MINE Don't you understand? Unlike you, I can't get anyone to sub for me! Don't you get that?! Take that argument and shove it. Bye. Hi. - Ready? - Yes. - Does our star know her lines? - I do. But I'm so upset! Nobody can piss you off like your own sister. No, I don't know if I remember my lines. - You're terribly shiny. Allow me. - I'll do it myself. I've had enough. And get me some menthol right before we shoot. - Okay. - Come closer to the set. Rehearsal! Places, everyone! - How do I look? - Fabulous. You're such a liar. But somehow it makes me feel better. Hold my phone, okay? Come join us. I'm Marta Makowska. Hello. Pawel. He's not exactly the Casanova type. But that could make the story more interesting. So, Pawel. This marks your first appearance on the show. But we're playing 'love' right off the bat. Hey. What's up? - I'm busy. - What are you doing? Don't you have stuff to do, Mum? I have piano lessons. I have to take Grandma to the hospital. You should eat out today. Bye. Nice and brown. Just as you like it. Eat, eat. Listen... Do we really need to go to the hospital? I feel fine. - There's no... - Mother! How about we just skip it! This is your last check-up. You'll be done soon! We're going. She was supposed to be here an hour ago. Now she's just swallowing her food whole. Why do you talk of me as if I wasn't here? I came, didn't I? Kasia was supposed to take Mum. You're older. You should be smarter. Come on! She's 40! Hi, Marta. Give me a kiss. You reek! It was my name day. Which you forgot. Best wishes. Mum, your towel. I'll sit down for a moment. Hello. Miss Grazyna! How nice. I brought my mother in for scheduled admission. Let's see her ID. Mum, your ID. I forgot where I put it. - This? - Yes... Please fill this out. - What is today's date? - The 13th. 13th, Mum. Not 30th. So, are you going to leave him? The dark-haired one is so handsome! I wouldn't think twice if I were you. Thank you. Fourth floor. One more thing. - An autograph for my daughter. - Mum, wait. - What's her name? - Asia. Thank you. Big TV star, my ass. I need to pee. So go. I'll wait here. Everything okay? Mum? Mum? Mum?! Do not enter! What's going on? Please stay out. Sorry, my phone was on silent. - Any news? - We're waiting. She could sense something was wrong! - Zuzia! - Leave it on, Grandpa. Let me help you. Does it hurt? I'll get you a chair. She was fine. She even called me! Have a seat. How is she, Doctor? I'm the husband. Tadeusz Makowski. Piotr Wolski. Broken spine. Fifth and sixth thoracic vertebra. Not now, Dad. The CT scan showed a massive stroke. We'll need you to sign a consent form. - Is that you? - Yes, and... Marta. Yes, me. May I have a word, Doctor. Is it dangerous? Yes, but without the surgery she will die for sure. She had a massive seizure, followed by a hemorrhagic stroke. The blood has nowhere to go. We need to operate. The brain is like a canister. But she has diabetes, hypertension, cancer. - When is my wife coming home? - How is he supposed to know? I won't make it without her. Let's go. - Sign here. - Of course. NO ENTRY - Any news? - No, they're still operating. I need to pee. Take the lift down to the lobby. The restroom is by the exit. I won't go by myself. I'm scared. Scared of the lift? At your age? No way. Then I'll hold it. Wash your hands. - Holy Mary, Mother of God... - Let's go. Maybe it's over. ...now and in the hour of our death. Amen. Her condition is serious. We were unable to locate the hemorrhage. We'll keep her in a medically induced coma. How long? No less than 24 hours. Possibly longer. But she's going to be okay? Please come back tomorrow. You don't care about my mother at all. Then fucking go live with yours! Kasia, not in front of the kid. He's not a kid anymore. It's about time. I'm so fucking fed up. Let's just get a divorce! Who else would put up with you? Could one of you give me cash for the field trip? Me, of course. Because your good-for-nothing father doesn't have a job! I'm looking. - How much? - 150. And some pocket money? I love you, son. - Have fun. - Thanks. And you! Do something. Get out of the house already! And now he's sulking. Sulking. Hello? This is she. I'm on my way. - Is it Grandma? - She has an aneurysm. - I'll go with you. - Don't you have an exam? - I do, but... - You need to pass your exams! - Maybe I should come... - I'll keep you posted. - It doesn't look good. - Doctor? Lunch for your son. Meatloaf and beet salad. Thanks, darling. So... An aneurysm is a ticking time bomb. If it had happened outside the hospital, your mother would be dead. - But the first surgery was successful! - Is she getting worse? Your mother's chances of recovery are slim. Especially due to her other illnesses. How can you say that? It's like you're killing her. Stop acting like a child. - Don't lecture me! - Shut up! Smartass. Is it bad, Doctor? I'm sorry. We have a therapist on the premises, if you want. I don't need one, thank you. I wouldn't mind. Motherfuckers! Go to work. I'll stay here. "I'm sitting at home, healthy little miss but, of this I'm certain, something is amiss heaps of toys and games, computers and books, ribbons, beads and hairpins in the cupboard nooks. All my friends are throwing jealous looks, it shows, because, unlike me, they don't have nice clothes. I may have art classes, swimming and ballet, but in spite of all that I'm still sad today. I'd give it all up down to the last crumb if only I could play with Dad or Mum. I talk to the echo, in this house so cold, I wish someone heard the... ...the sad tale I told." Now let's get chummy, donuts are yummy, Let's fill your tummy... - Is she awake? - No. - Drinking already? - Is that a problem? - I'll get some plates. - What kind of filling? Eggnog, raspberry, chocolate. No plain ones? You haven't finished your food. Sweetie... You're beautiful. Come home already. You hear me? This instant! - What else did the doctor say? - I don't know. Not now. Filip, come inside. What are you doing out here? How could you do this to me? - It's not what you think... - At a time like this? How could you? Makowski speaking. Almost done. Just a few more touch-ups. Yes, yes. See you then. I can't make it today. She forced me to come. Get this. To see a priest or something. Otherwise I'm screwed. I'll have it for you tomorrow. You want more? No problem. It will come with a blessing. - Want to go pee-pee? - No. - The toilet is clean! - I don't want to. She's absorbing it. She's absorbing it... She's absorbing it. Energy? Yes. The way she's absorbing it, means she's going to live! Elzbieta... Wake up. Wake up, Elzbieta! This means she's going to live! Call me next week, I'll pop by again. You know what? I'd rather pay you. I feel uncomfortable. I never charge for hospital visits. Then how about... Chocolates? I won't say no to chocolates. You should spend a lot of time here. Sitting, talking. The way she's absorbing it means she'll live. - She'll live. - Thank you. I'm sorry, Mum. You know. "She who understands - Mother, We're always in Her heart, She sees the good in us - Mother, at no time are we apart" Mafia? Are you with Mum? Filip and I are at Father Marek's. Everything will be fine, you'll see. Did the healer come? That's wonderful! Everything will be fine! Can I talk to Mum? Hold on. Talk now. Mummy? Wake up! Wake up, my baby! My sweetie-pie! Don't treat her like a child. Everything will be fine. I love you so much. I'm sending you a thousand hugs. Many kisses. You'll wake up, you'll see. Okay, enough. Bye. One of us is adopted. Grandpa! Sweetie? Now Grandpa will have to fill Grandma's shoes. I don't know if I'll manage. Stop it. The left hemisphere is flooded. It's not functioning. The aneurysm caused irreversible damage. Now what? What's the best-case scenario? In my opinion, your mother will remain in the vegetative state. What are you trying to say? I'm trying to say... There is no best-case scenario. Do you want the TV on? No. Maybe I'll give you an antidepressant. Come on. You think there's a pill for everything? Dad, did you know that I... I was in therapy for two years. What for? I couldn't deal with myself on my own. And now you can? Actually, no. But at least now I know why. And why is that? I have a problem with you. Who? Me? You would make every guy I was with look bad. As if you were jealous. As if you didn't want me to be with anyone. That's bullshit. I always wanted what's best for you. I took you to practice, didn't I? I know. But I'm talking about the subconscious. There was this one session, when the therapist told me to stand on a chair... and... imagine that you were standing in front of me. Dressed in rags. And I was supposed to talk to you. No. And you spent money on this? - Yes. A lot, actually. - Idiot. Idiot. You should have bought yourself something pretty instead. All you wear are track suits. Like a guy. Okay, look. Do I look like a guy to you? No man wants a woman who always wears pants! Stop it, Dad. I'm her fucking problem! Ready? Camera! Places! Action! I love you, but I don't think we should... - I think we're made for each other. - I can't get a divorce. - How about we just... - Stop! Marta, excellent. Pawel, a word. - Everything is great, but... - I have to take this. Hello? Is it Dad? Are you nuts? None of that shaman bullshit! No, no, no! I don't have time. I can't talk now! Bye. Daniel! - Thanks. - Darling! Listen, it really shows that you dislike him. If you keep this up, they'll kick you off the show! Fine, let them kill me off. I'll finally do some real acting. Besides, his breath stinks. You know what they say: Not everyone fans bubbles. And don't squint. Let people see your gorgeous eyes. Everyone, places! Get Pawel a breath mint! - I want to thank you so much... - Please lie down. Elzbieta... What the... Are you here, Elzbieta? Wow. Let's go already. We just got here! Let's stay a while. - Hello. - Hello, Doctor. Allow me to introduce myself. Tadeusz Makowski. The husband. Izabela Kwiecien. Nice to meet you. - You're Jewish! - Dad! I am from Wasilkow. And I guess you are, too? I must have seen you there. Excuse me, Doctor. This is for you. A little token... From me. Chocolates. Could you explain my mother's condition to my father in technical terms? Dad is an architect, so... Certainly. Come see me. What's wrong with you? So there is no blood flow in this brain hemisphere. Do you understand? It doesn't work. And do you think... that Mum can hear or feel anything? To be honest... I don't know. Let's go! Marta... Dad! What happened? I don't know. You passed out! How are you feeling? Like a bat in hell. Dad fainted at the hospital. He worries so much. No wonder. All those years together. - How was the shaman? - Fantastic. She was sorry you couldn't make it. You broke the full circle. Mum or the shaman? The shaman! I'm sorry... Did you chant mantras? Even Dad? I don't believe that. No, she chanted. - You're such an unbeliever! - I'm not! First you make a holy pilgrimage, then you connect with ghosts in Shamanic rituals? Make up your mind! - We should try everything. - No, you should think! Think! Why do you always insult me? You think you're better? You called a healer, too! - I think you're becoming an alcoholic. - Like you don't drink? Excuse me... I feel silly saying this at the gym... I just wanted to say that you're a great actress. - Thank you. - I mean it. Have a good day. Hello? Dad? Sweetie! Mum! - Do you recognize me? - Look at her look! Can you hear me? Tickle, tickle! - Hello! Hi. - You can hear me now, right? Zuzia is here. She can see us! Come home already. We're so happy. It's a miracle, isn't it? We call it 'sudden lucidity.' Your mother is suffering from quadriplegia. She's paralyzed. She doesn't know what happened. She needs to slowly adjust to reality. Mum, that looks awful. Let's just order a pizza. I made this meat according to Grandma's recipe. - How is the job hunt going, Grzes? - Fucking sucks. I'm going to England. - Don't talk like that in front of the kid! - I'm no kid. I know those words. You do? - Hurry up, it's hot! - Hold it! What's this? Let me see? A fly. No. Sorry. - You think you can cook like Grandma? - No. - Her cooking is the best. - Okay, so I can't cook! - Well, wasn't that a feast. - Here's to Dad! - I'm sorry. I've been awful to you lately. - No doubt about it. But I know you, you little minx. What are we going to do about Egypt? It's already paid for. Like rabbits. No restraint. Like rabbits! Lunch is ready. It's 3pm and you're not even dressed. I'm not getting dressed. Stop trying to train me. Go take care of that layabout of yours. - Why would you say that? - Because it's true. I cook, I clean, I do everything. Yet somehow it's always about Marta. Go ahead, have your beloved daughter come here. Marta, talk to Dad. He won't listen to me. He's refusing to eat and go to that computer thing you set up... Here he is. It's Marta. Hello? Listen. Tell me, what was the name of that... That boxer. In that book. That book! I don't give a crap about food! Tell me. I'm asking. What was the name of that boxer... I'm not going to that stupid... Dad! Are you crazy? Where is it? Tumor of the right frontal lobe. - Where? - Right there. Hemorrhaged. I'm not sure if it's operable. Is your father right-handed? Yes. Then we might say it's a fortunate location. Fortunate? The neurosurgeons will give you more details. Give me the other one. Wait, Dad. - Done? - Is it on? - That was fun. - Was it? Let me help you. Except it was windy. Very cold. Windy? Candy bar! You promised. Well, if I promised... Here it is! But you have to beg for it. Beg! Come on, don't get offended. We're coming. You sure have a sweet tooth, don't you? - Hi, Rafal. - Good evening. Mom, pull yourself together. Is my sex drive currently: A) same as before, B) lower, C) non-existent Am I: A) sad, B) cheerful, C) I feel nothing? Is this a joke? Why are you laughing? You're depressed. - We'll prescribe you some meds. - What kind of meds? Here. This one - twice a day. This one - only before bed. - And all the best to your mother! - Thank you. - You threw out the prescription? - I don't need antidepressants. Maybe I do. I'll have these ready tomorrow. Tomorrow morning. I'm going to the hospital later. Who knows what might happen then. - Going in for a check-up? - No, surgery. I have a brain tumor. Five by five centimetres. Need to get it out. What can I say. So what am I to do about that roof? I told you. Break it here. And raise it here. You see? I thought I was the one with brain damage! Why so glum? It makes you two look ugly. Okay. Put your pajama bottoms on. You don't want to parade around with your bare ass. - I will if I want to. - Then I hope you won't want to. Maybe I will. Go on, put them on. Wait. Now. Looking good. Goodbye! Where is Mum's room? On another floor. She's in intensive care. - Why can't I be there? - They don't take walk-ins. Tell them to put in a double bed. We'll just lie there together. I bet no one has thought of that. I was first! Hello. Look, the nice lady is there. Hello. One moment. Tadeusz Makowski. I'll need his medical history. Please stay behind the counter. Please fill this out. And you, sir. Follow me to Room 2. Toilet. This way. Right through here. Hello. He looks relieved to have something wrong with his brain, too. And that he'll be having surgery, just like Mum. You're talking out of your ass! Thank you. Hello! Hello. You forgot my pillow! Could it have been caused by stress? About Mum? No, it's just an unlucky coincidence. From our perspective, your parents are separate cases. If you want to help, you may donate blood. All right. What's going to happen to our Dad? After the surgery? That depends on the histopathology report. I'm sorry. That's all I can say at this point. Thank you. Goodbye. Excuse me! - You forgot something. - No, no. Please take it back. It's unnecessary. Really. Thank you. You're insane. Goodbye! This is me giving presents. Very original. No need, really. Are you sure? "...is having an affair with a married man, father of two. Our reporters spotted them necking at a trendy Warsaw club..." Mum never read that junk. - Of course she did! - She didn't. - "Since her public..." - Shit! What? I nicked her finger. What have you done! I'll fetch the nurse. Who needs the nurse! I'm sorry! They're like Romeo and Juliet, don't you think? Now Dad is following Mum. You could put it that way. Or you could say that we're about to lose both mother and father. Jesus Christ. How will I ever manage without them? Right. How will you manage? You are such a cold-hearted bitch. How could you be so heartless? You cow. You and your self-pity. Get a grip! But I'm not like you! Having a grip on everything. I'm not like you! I'm different. Maybe that's why you can't find a man. They don't like that. You, on the other hand, have a model husband. At least I have one! I won't sit here! Why all the shouting! - Fuck this! - You need to pee? Or more? Pee and poop! You're ripping out your catheter! You're in the hospital. Post-surgery. Calm down now. That's silly talk! I'm not in hospital! If you don't take it easy, I'll strap you down. I'm at home! Kasia! I have the right to pee! You cow! Go ahead and pee. I can do whatever I want! Easy, now. Hello? Marta? Come pick me up. Pick me up. I'm in the rift. In the rocks. They looked me in here. Come. In the rift! Marta! Come get me. What are you doing here? This is the gynecology ward! I am stuck in a rift, ma'am! Ah, a neurosurgery patient. Wait here, sir. Let me get your throne, and off we go. Looking for some fun, are we? After surgery? Come on, sit. Riding like a king! Yes, like a king. - I'm with Mum, you're with Dad? - Or the other way around. You should see him. Daddy's little girl. Fuck off, Miss Jealous. - Like it? - Merry-go-round. You're about to take a bow! The end! I'll choke! Come on. Something wrong? Head... You have a headache? Then we'll stop. - You want it up or down? - Good. Okay. - Let me... - What? I'll take the wrapper off. Like it? Isn't that refreshing? That's that. And this is the Holy Mary. From Father Marek. She'll be there for you. It's making a noise! Something is... It's making a noise. I don't know why. The pump needs to be replaced. Tell me, do you think Mum is doing better? Please ask the doctors. We're not allowed to answer questions from the family. Maybe there's something I could bring for Mum, or... Body lotion. Fortunately, she doesn't have any bedsores yet. You'll tell me everything when you wake up, right? Mum? I wanted to ask you something. We booked a trip to Egypt. A long time ago. And I don't know if I can go. You're here, Dad is... I mean, Dad is all right! But he needs me, too. Can I go? Can I? - Hi, Aunt Marta. - Hi. What's wrong? I need weed. How would I.. Cut the crap. Your mother won't find out. I need it for Grandpa. Keep the change. It's not a set-up! THC supposedly helps with brain tumors. In the States, you can buy it with a prescription. - Over there. - What? Where? - Are you with Sphinx Travel? - Yes. - You have your badges? - What badges? - First-timers? - No, I forgot to label the luggage. Follow me to the check-in line. This way. So many people! Will we make it? Easy. You're almost on holiday. What's the name of your hotel? Ali Baba. It'll do. What do you mean? It was supposed to be the best! You need to finish that here. I'm never going away with you again. You're so lame. Shut up and enjoy it. I know, Mum. You're uncomfortable. Is there some way I can help you? I don't know what you're saying. I don't know. What are you doing! Hang on. He broke it! Stop! Mow it! Just make it even! Moron! He fucks everything up! Don't touch it. I'm a corporal. He's a private. He sucks at mowing. - And he argues with me! - Let it go. I'm talking to a moron! It's good of you to come. Thank you, Uncle Roman. Don't touch it! Leave it alone. Thank you. You know what I remembered the other day? We went to Hungary together. Remember? I needed to have straight A's for you to take me. And I know you cheated on Dad there. I promised myself I'd tell him everything when we got back, but then... I got scared that he might hum you. You naughty girl! - Hello. - Yes? I'm here for my Dad's histopathology report. Tadeusz Makowski. - Makowski, is it? - Yes. - Here it is. - Thank you. I also need a... referral for radiotherapy. You don't need a referral... You don't know shit about what I do or do not need! Hello. What's going on? I'm sorry. The most malignant of gliomas. How dreadful. How much time does he have left? It's hard to say. Not long. Enjoy every moment. Where's my... - I can't blow smoke rings. - Hello? Hi, Zuzia. Smoking weed with Grandpa. Really! Okay, talk to him. Hi, Zuzia. The worst one. Stage four. Don't worry. Everything will be fine. Bye. Kisses. Give it. What are you doing here? - Smoking. - God, what is that? - Marta, have you lost your mind? - Take a hit. Aren't you cold, Daddy? Aren't you cold? - Aren't you cold? - Aren't you cold? Marta! Aren't you cold... - Aren't you cold? - Time for bed, Dad! Aren't you cold? I got a call from our aunt yesterday. - I don't know. I agree with her. - Could you be more specific? Glasses! Don't lose them. What? She says that in his current condition, Dad might give away all his money. The oar, the house... So I thought... Maybe we should have him incapacitated. Then I would be responsible. - Excuse me? - Don't get upset. It's just an idea. Just an idea?! It's his money. His house. Not yours. Understand? I know. - I wanted to talk... - I know what you wanted. Shame on you. - Tadeusz Makowski. - Here I am! - Here. - Come, Daddy. What would you like to eat? - Steak tartare and a shot of vodka. - You can't get vodka here! But maybe you can get steak tartare. - Anything to drink? - Beer. - They don't have beer. - Alcohol-free? Stop whining. Are you from Wasilkow? No. Do you know where I could buy liquor? - What are you eating? - Beans. - Baked? - Yes. They didn't have alcohol-free beer. You'll have to settle for fruit punch. Listen. We have to go and talk to the doctor. Do you want to see Mum? No, never mind. Then finish your food and wait for us here. - And don't go anywhere. - Where would I go? - Come on. - I'm coming! See you later. Wait! LIQUOR STORE What are you doing, Dad? Dad! - Leave me the fuck alone! - Dad, you pissed yourself! - Fuck off, you cow! - Are you crazy? Come. Okay, hop out. You're both cows. Dingbats. Come. Take this. - Can't you... - Just throw it out! Dad, wait. Wait for me! You're dying, you know? Your systems are shutting down. You can't even pee anymore. And I can't cry. It's hard to tell whether you're here or already there. What's it like over there? I remember how you told me that you didn't want to live anymore. That you were tired of it. I also wanted to tell you about Dad. Dad is very ill. I didn't tell you sooner because I didn't want you to worry. Dad has brain cancer. And I wanted to tell you that... I will take care of him. Maybe not as well as you would. But I'll do my best. I promise you that. I just wanted you to know. Your mother just passed away. I'm sorry. Would you like some valium? I just took one of yours. Now you got me! Look, you have one, two, three, four, five, six. I only have four. So you win! See? I haven't told him. She's gone. Mum, today is your name day. I wish you a beautiful journey to heaven. I always had trouble picking out a gift for you. Because you never liked anything. You were the belle of every ball. Anytime we went somewhere, I felt like the ugly child of that pretty lady. That's why today... I wore this. A headdress. I thought you'd like that. There are many things I didn't have time to tell you. And things I didn't have time to learn from you. Like how to make stuffed cabbage and jellied fish. See you later, Mum. This life is but a passing moment. You were not an ugly child. But otherwise, well said. Beautifully said, Mum. I'll pick you up tomorrow morning. Pack Dad's things. What? Screw you. - You have a bone to pick? - No. You only talked about yourself! At the church. You didn't mention me once! You could have had your own speech! - Nobody was stopping you! - I thought you would speak for all of us. I don't know, go see your friends or something. Cry on their shoulders. Poor you. Taking care of Daddy all by yourself. Do it! Then why don't you live here? Switch places with me! I can't watch you leeching money off him like that! - He can't do anything about it! - Excuse me?! Don't play dumb! What about the new garden furniture? - You're taking over the house. - That's not true! Grow up! I'm done taking care of you. You're taking care of me?! Get the fuck out of here! - What did you say to me? - Enough, Marta. - Don't you touch me. - Why not? - You think you can boss everyone around? - You simpleton! - Don't touch me! - Get out! - This isn't your... - Get out, now! - Grzes... - What?! Make up your minds already. Why am I going with you. Miserable cows. Sitting there all sad. - You were at each other's throats yesterday. - Who, us? No. - I need to take a dump. - Jesus! Pull over. He will shit himself. I'll stop at the nearest gas station. - Dad, can you hold it? - Maybe. Fuck. Hi, Piotr. You called. I'm away in the countryside with Kasia and our father. I'll call you later. Bye. No way, Dad. Sir, we need to return this. - You can't drink. - I can, too! - You can't. - Bullshit! Give it back. Why are you doing this? Excuse me, but this man is not incapacitated! - But he's sick! - They're idiots! - Please, Dad. - Look, a beer! One beer. We'll take it. If I was behind the wheel... I'd take you for a ride. Right through the fields. It would make your heads spin. Like this... I'd show you what it's like to drive in a rally. My life is a failure. Oh yeah? And mine is a success. Queen of the world. You always went after married men. If only Dad knew! I think he is the man of my life. None of your boyfriends was ever good enough for him. Come to think of it, he never really accepted Grzes either. Shocking. Perfect man that he is. Fuck off. Remember when we were kids... Dad would sometimes take a nap on the sofa after work. Oh, how I loved to snuggle up to him! Then Mum told me it wasn't proper for a big girl like me. I don't remember that. I only remember that you were the best at everything. The smartest. And I was the stupid one. Look. Your friends! Thanks. Everything will disappear And the world will not care Everything will disappear And the world will not care Whether we call it good or evil Then again looking back It might be useful to have TO MY PARENTS Someone to blame for my sins English subtitles by: Karolina Koltun
