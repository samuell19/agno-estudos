In 2012, they were talking about the world ending, but then nothing happened. Or we think nothing happened, but you know, maybe we're really all just dead. We've been dead since December 21, 2012, and we were transferred onto a server as we dreamed. We woke up on December 22 without even noticing. But we were no longer in the same world. The only problem is that there were glitches in the transfer. A good example is Nelson Mandela. Everyone remembered him dying in the 1980s in prison. Everyone was sure they'd seen his funeral on TV. And now they're telling us he died in 2013. Nothing is real. That's the big change that the Maya predicted for 2012. It wasn't the end of the world, just a change. So you know, you don't have to be someone. You don't have to have money. You don't have to worry about other people. Because no part of that is real. There's no other way to explain it. Since 2012, we've been living in a simulation. No! Fuck no! Hey, you motherfucker! Hey, you fucking arrogant little fucker! I got you a work permit, you're with me for two years! No! You shut your mouth, I ain't finished. You're with me for two years, you hear me? Next time, I'll break your fucking legs. I'll smash your kneecaps! Any idea how much I'm losing because of your stupidity? Listen, get your ass down here and we'll talk! Hey man. Hello. Big race? Old race. Oh yeah? Does he win? No, he loses. After seven laps, he makes a fucking stupid mistake. Two one-hundredths of a second. Anyways, when an athlete loses, he cries. Here's a new batch. Tell me what you think. Perfect. Thanks, bye. Bye. What's your fucking problem, asshole? You almost ran me over. I almost ran you over? You shouldn't even be on the street! -Check your blind spots! -Use the fucking bike path! I was in front of you. What's your fucking problem? Whoa, let him go! You're fucking deranged! Say you're sorry! Let him go! Come on! -I'm calling the cops. -I'm sorry. -You okay? -Yeah, fine. Hello everyone, welcome to episode 112 of Very Nice Day. Today I wanted to talk about coincidences. I don't personally believe in coincidences. Things always happen for a reason. It's part of the code. And we can read the code, but to do that, we can't rely on our instincts. Because they lie to us. Our instincts are the product of millions of years of evolution. But we've only been living in this new reality for ten years. And we've been given clues about this transition. Do you remember The Truman Show, that movie with Jim Carrey? I remember when I saw it as a kid, it really unsettled me. I started to see extras everywhere. Do you remember The Truman Show, that movie with Jim Carrey? I remember when I saw it as a kid, it really unsettled me. I started to see extras everywhere. I'd look into a mirror and start speaking to the audience, for practice. It doesn't matter. I don't care. I no longer feel interesting. Don't hesitate to leave a comment if you feel like this is your... This is your situation. Don't hesitate, it'd be a pleasure to hear from you. Marcel, come here! Come here. You're trouble, aren't you? Careful, careful. Hey, you little troublemaker. Hey, careful. I don't want any marks on the wall. It's hot in here! Let me tell you my favourite dream. It's in, like, a salt mine or a goldmine, something like that. We go down in the elevator with our gear and we walk through long tunnels. I don't know how long, but it seems like it takes forever. Suddenly, we get to the deposit. And then everything becomes clear. It's a mine of faces. With literally hundreds of thousands of faces. A bunch of people I know. People I don't talk to anymore, like my parents. The other workers start digging. Taking the faces from the walls and putting them in barrels. The foreman always pushes me towards the walls. He always yells at me, "What the hell are you waiting for?" He's super aggressive with me, I don't know why. Then I know I'm about to wake up. And I wake. If you have recurring dreams, write and share them with me. I'd be happy to analyze them and discuss them with you. Leave a comment below... I'm just coming out of a meeting and I'm dying to tell you, you'll be the first to know. Hi all! I'm having a yoga morning because it'll do me good. Today I'm dedicating my session to you! Mega crush on this handbag by Jacquemus. I love you! Meet-up at 3pm, come see me! I can't wait. All the beautiful people! Gonna be lit! How does plant intelligence work? In this lab at the University of Florence in Italy, researchers are trying to decode the signals emitted by plants. Their innovative approach is part of the European PLEASED project. Plants are able to sense gravity and electrical fields, magnetic fields, chemical gradients, etcetera. This huge amount of information that plants receive is there for the taking. We just have to find a way to decode it and make it usable. Plants are constantly on alert, gathering information about their environment in order to predict external aggression, for example. Over 700 different types of sensors have been observed in plants. Here they test plant reactions to external stimuli. By observing the plants' signals, we are able to precisely determine which stimuli cause which response. Once we can accurately read these signals, we'll be able to amplify and digitize them. In other words, an analog signal that varies over time... I want to eat a Poke Bowl. My favourite here is the Sunset Beach. And how do I like it, Ariane? With extra avocado. It's the best. Say the promo code. The promo code is AVOCADO. You'll get 10% off. 10% off for my followers. Where is that baby? There she is! It's Daddy! Yes, Daddy, that's me! Yes! Who's the pretty one? You're the pretty one! So babe, how are your breasts? Not so good. Painful as hell this morning. You can't give up, babe. It's full of antibodies, you know. Breast milk is important for her. I can't see, let me see her! Oh my, you're the pretty one! Yes, I said pretty! Oh yes, you're a princess! -Yes? -Hello! I have a delivery. A Poke Bowl. No, I didn't order any food. Well, we have this delivery for Élyane Boisjoli, is that right? -A Poke Bowl? -That's right. With extra avocado. I didn't order that. Sorry. Well, listen, if you want, this delivery is to your address, so take it, it's on the house. No thanks, I don't need it. You can eat it. Enjoy! This smells so good, man. Smell this! You didn't even catch it. Well, I didn't think you were gonna... Sorry. I'm happy to see you. Me too. But do you think you can sell me something? I put a muffin in the bag. Nice. A normal one. Made with carrots. Okay. I'm going to go now. Hey Jay. Cleaning job Tomorrow 5pm. Confirm ASAP Aw fuck. Hi guys! I can't talk about what's going on, but it's life-changing. Leaving for Toronto right away for a thing. I'll keep you posted. But I need you. Haven't been to Toronto for years, so I need your recommendations. I love you so much. Gotta go pack! Kisses! If you had to pick... Blue pill or red pill? Oh fuck! -Hello. -Yes? I wanted to ask, did anybody pick up the bag? What? The delivery. Did someone take it? I don't know what you're talking about. C'mon, you know what I mean... -Got no idea. -Help me out here. Go away, you're bothering me. Just answer yes or no! No idea what you mean! You have reached the voicemail of Jérémie. You arrogant shithead! When I tell you where to leave a bag, don't fucking leave it somewhere else. Any idea how much I'm losing because of your stupidity? Next time, I'll break your fucking legs. I'll smash your kneecaps! Hey! You can't just show up without warning! I know, it's just that... Come on, please? Can you... Can you just help me? I'm closed. It won't take long. I just need a fix. Please. It's late man. Have you seen the time? Have you seen my face? Can I tell you something? I guess you got no choice, eh? My mom must have been 40 or 42. So I was old enough to stay home alone. She was thinking of going back to school to become a nurse. But she thought she was too old, it wasn't worth it. Tonight was her birthday. She turned 66. She said, "Fuck! I'm still in shape, "I could have been a nurse for 20 years and helped people." Anyway, I guess what I mean is you don't know. Maybe your apartment will catch fire, maybe you'll die in the next 30 seconds. But probably not. You don't know. Take one every six hours. If you have trouble breathing, stop taking it. It's on the house. I'm going back to bed. Could you rinse your plate before you leave? -Sure. -Good night. Good night. Thanks, man. That was just a warning. You still owe me for what you lost. -Going up? -No, I'm not. Hello everyone. This isn't going to be a normal episode. Actually, I wanted to tell you that I'm taking a break from the podcast. More and more of you are writing to me, and that really warms my heart. I read every comment I get. But for personal reasons, I have to stop making the podcast. So... Thank you for listening, and I wish you a very nice day. Very Nice Day
