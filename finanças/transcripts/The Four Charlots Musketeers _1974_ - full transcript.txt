THE FOUR CHARLOTS MUSKETEERS We are the Musketeers, the musketeers of the King Masters in swordplay, honour is our law. To go to war, that is our mission. One for all, all for one. One for all, all for one, like the five fingers in the hand. We are the Three Musketeers plus One - Hello. - Hello. We'll tell you about the extraordinary adventures ... That happened to us. We're the squires of the four musketeers. - And thanks to our deeds ... - They are famous. But at the end of the battle, who raises his hand in triumph? It's always the General, and never the poor Soldier. - It's been always like that. - The little one stays in the shadows... ...and the big one in the sun. Even with the most honest king for the fairer he may be... With the poor people ... he gives them what he pleases. And who wins the battle in heavy combat? It's always the General and never the poor Soldier. And now thanks to us, ... ...folks, our musketeers for their great deeds ... ...are invited by the King. Who crowned them with laurels and we - unhappy servants .. ...only smell them in the kitchen. And who gets the medal after a heavy battle? It's always the General, and never the poor Soldier. Here are the four valiant nobleman, which I spoke about, Your Majesty. Monsieur d'Artagnan, ... Monsieur Porthos, ... Monsieur Athos ... ... Monsieur Aramis. Gentlemen, I'm very proud of you. Monsieur de Treville will assign you a rank and privileges ... ...for your dedication and bravery. D'Artagnan and Porthos, Athos and Aramis ... Reaping the benefits of our bravery and fearlessness. Friends, between us, We're just jammed. We are worthy of praise no less than they are, as well as the medals... ... always for the General, but never for the Soldier. If D'Artagnan, Porthos, Athos and Aramis ... Despite the efforts of the Cardinal are still alive and serve the king... ...to each one of us, they own their life. D'Artagnan to Planchet, Porthos to Mousqueton. Aramis to Bazin, Athos to Grimaud. What a joy to see you. We celebrate your victory, Monsieur d'Artagnan. And drank to your triumph, Monsieur Porthos. Are you happy with the words of His Majesty, Monsieur Athos? Was your courage enough rewarded, Monsieur Aramis? We're singing ... We continue to sing your glory. You sing? .. Very pleased. Now let's dance. " Now let's dance" not bad, let's write it down. You also sing their exploits? Then give them the sword, let them show what they are capable of, First I going to clean your horse, Monsieur Athos. I'll check if the harness in your horse is fine, Monsieur Porthos. I'll see if your boots are polished, Monsieur Aramis. Have you seen this? The royal praise, turned their heads, .. It happens, we are all humans. Threatening poor people, do you think it's human? How many times have we saved their lives. If I get into a fight with them, I could stab someone inadvertently. Yes, it happens frequently. You're right. By the way, everything I told, is true. Can you remember anything else? Sure. Even if it sounds implausible, it is true. Truth is sometimes implausible, well said, we need to write ... - I'm all ears. - And I - Planchet. No, the entire story. We writers are accustomed to communicate in a sophisticated manner. - "I'm all ears"...so I listen. - I listen to you ... Let's go, chief. Thus, a certain Dumas public scribe and chronicler .. ... to this day in July 1627 with an intolerable thirst ... ... that with no ideas coming to mind would wet his throat in a tavern... ...and got aquainted with our squires.. If he had not fall in love with their narrative... ... and if his manuscript had not come to us ... ... we could never tell you about these incredible adventures. At the beginning of our history Planchet was looking for work. Hi. I also did the barrel, I could help you a little. Are you crazy? Get out of here. Even then, to get a job was not so easy. Look. here. His father used to tell him only with perseverance he would reach a goal. What do you want? .. Can't you see I'm working. - I could help. - Leave me alone. Initially, our hero was not very lucky. - Do you want to take my place? - Not at all. Now I'll touch up your portrait. Shame on you to hit a man when he's down? Get off. Your Excellency, how can I thank you? Take a bath and come to the "Golden Sun " for a drink. The Providence sent him a good master... ... in the person of the Chevalier d'Artagnan. - Are you okay? - Yes, my Lord. - What you feel about the musketeers? - Average. I appointed three duels in Karm de Chaux. Three duels in Chaux de Karm, you're kidding? I never joke, when it comes to honor. If it is a matter of honor, then ... Yes, my dear Planchet, maybe tomorrow you ... ... lose your master, if I can not send ... to a better world ... one by one, Monsieur Athos, Porthos and Aramis. Athos, Porthos and Aramis, the famous musketeers? - Do you know them? - No, but I know their squires. Calm down, I'm still alive. Get me the best horse. D'Artagnan never beat neither his horse nor his squire. But was always ready to stick his sword on whoever would challenge him. Not wanting to lose his master... Planchet decided at any cost to stop him from these three duels. Sorry. "LIFE SHELLFISH" - As always inimitable. - Now is not the time. - This is serious. - What happened to you? My master D'Artagnan wants to fight with yours. With Athos, Porthos and Aramis? Why? If I knew. They'll cut him into pieces, like this. Rather, it is your masters who will be cut into pieces. Last week, Porthos pierced his two best friends. - And Athos made holes in three. - And Aramis in four. Well, his sword is longer. Are you finished? You do not understand? - What's the matter? - You think like chumps. Take it easy. Do not fight, my friends. Taste this new wine. Do not worry, let us calmly fight. Better not, and then get as last time. But seriously. When we finally were lucky with our masters. We need to take care ... about their safety. They 're not going to die all at once. Usually there is a winner, and a loser, in the duel. Yes. The loser is always buried in the ground. Why? Because he's dead. Now you understand? And the winner? And the winner, by order of the Cardinal. - What's this gesture? - The winner is hanged. Because is forbideen to kill in duel under death penalty. - What a joke!. - So what? If we do not prevent them, then we'll move on to the straw. - We must do something. - We have to do as in 14. - In 14? -In 1514 as the Battle of Morenero. Was not in 1515? Yes, I remember. - Mosqueton. - So, then?. - I have an idea. It's risky but... Tomorrow we will all four go to Karm de Chaux. PROHIBITED DUELS on Sundays, Holidays and other days of the week Here he is. Who among you will give me pleasure to kill him first? Fate chose me, to teach you a lesson. Your last fencing lesson. - Attention Musketeers. - Guards of the Cardinal. Sword in its sheath, gentlemen. - Staging a duel? Don't you know his Eminence order? The mustache is lose. That a duel is punished with death penalty? For your audacity clown, you also will pay with death.. Fold in your swords and please, follow us. This does not concern you, gentlemen, go your way. Careful, gentlemen, you are only three. Allow me gentlemen, we will be four. - One for all ... - All for one. - We must hide. - In the sheaves. That way. If D'Artagnan catches me, I will be killed. What the hell is happening there? Shut up! Something doesn't seem right. We need to intervene. Hide. What the hell... Shut up. Very strong this year. - What do we do? - We go help. - Here you go. - I'll take it. - Do you have everything? - Let's go. Hurry up! Hurry up! - I take this. - Are you ready? All ready? Let's go. We'll go this side, and you that side. Pruning time. Oh, a little carried away. You ... what are you doing? Are you crazy? .. What are you doing? What are you doing? Absolutely crazy. Retreating. Let's go. That way. There. Inside quickly. Look in the hay, maybe here? No, not here. Here it is. Straight ahead. Do not be afraid, I'm scared too. They want to kill me. Hide me. Hide me, please. - He should be here. - Search everything. - She should know? - Tell us where is he. I don't know. Now he will not escape. There he is. Come here. - Who, me? - Yes, you come here. As you say, there I go. Hold him. Grab him. Caught. I caught him. Where is he? Oh, shit. Where'd he go? This way. Oh, it's you? You again? What the hell. I nearly died. We'll chop you into pieces. Come here. I'm coming. He's here. Not here. He's there. No, he's there. I'm here. - We have to hide? - Under the cart. Better upstairs. Mosqueton, here, we have found shelter. Come. Quickly. Come up. You are trapped. In the king's name, you're under arrest. - Me? - Come up here. I repeat, in the name of the king, you're under arrest. - In the name of what? - Name of the King. Catch. To the cart. Thanks to their squires distraction... ...our valiant musketeers ... gained control of the situation. ...and in the end, won. My guards? You haven't taught them to fight, but luckily you have taught them to swim. 40 of my guardsmen beaten by four musketeers of the King. The Musketeers fought against the rules. You set out to definitively undermine my prestige? Forgive me, Your Excellency, His Majesty wants you to the Louvre. Affairs of state are calling Father Joseph. I give you all the authority over these river hares. Do not worry, Eminence, I have done the Jesuits, fanatics. Call these loafers. You two, since when you have ducky feet? Since you fell into the river? No, no, Father, it was a millstone. A millstone? - Yes. - Now we'll explain everything. - First there was the horse. - No, millstone. - No, there was a man on the millstone. - No, it was a bar. - Yes, the beam. - And the horse that was pulling it. - Yes, to crush grain. Horse pulling a millstone. - No, the beam. - What is the beam? Tied to a horse. - With a man? - Yes. - On the horse, but not on the beam. - Enough. Apparently this millstone drove through your heads. - Captain, I expect you to report. - Yes, Father. I can report that we are being attacked from within. - Inside? - Yes, they were traitors. Inside, outside, it does not matter. You all need to confess. On your knees, my son. What are you looking at? Quickly get on your knees. Forgive me, Father. It's my fault, my fault and my only fault. Well, my son your repentance seems sincere to me. I forgive your sins. Here is your redemption. - Did you like it? - Excellent. - Once more, Father. - No. This is not to get addicted. This is similar to lust. What is this wonderful thing, Father? This wonderful thing, my son, is called a baton. It is good to use in the head. Because you lose to the Musketeers in duels with swords, ... ... perhaps you will overcome them if you own these new weapons. Moreover, Monsieur Rochefort ... ... this baton unleashes the tongue during torture. With this weapon your army will be invincible. May God bless you all, and this sacred club. Blessed is the baton. In the Name of the Father the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. For the Guards of the Cardinal. That evening, D'Artagnan and his friends were celebrating the victory. Many times, men celebrate victories, friendship, love, with wine.. When men are happy, there is always celebrations. For us. - Long live the Normandy. - Long live the Poitou. - Long live the infusion. - Long live the Beaujolais. Long live the fun. The King sent for the musketeers, who defeated our guards. I wonder what punishment he has for them? His Majesty is going to punish them mercilessly. Yes, I hope His Majesty pleases heaven... ... and he does not come under adverse influence of Captain de Treville. Your Eminence, the King's office door is ajar. Why are you whispering, Father Joseph, speak louder. - The Kinkg's office door is ajar. - So close. Better not. We can overhear what is going on.. - Did you open it? - No, eminence, it is the providence. Well' if it is the holly providence. Forgive them, Your Majesty. This was a consequence of the inhuman fatigue after a hard battle. If it was a battle? Yes, gentlemen, if it was really a battle? Gentlemen, gentlemen, I am not happy with you. His Eminence expressed restraint and politeness... ... while speaking to me about your exploits. However, that's no excuse for those at the king's service. I have eyes and ears, to understand everything myself. - Why are they taking so long? - I do not know. And if they get arrested? Hope the King do not send them to the gallows. - What do you think, Planchet? - I don't know. You were four, they were about twenty. - Forty-two, sir. - Forty-two. And you think that you did right .. ... beating 42 of the Cardinal's Guardsman? They have just been spared you. If it wasn't for the respect that these worthy warriors ... ... have for their King by refusing to destroy ... ...four insolents like you, you wouldn't be standing now here, in front of me. You should thank them. And I'm not talking only about today... ... you should be apologizing to the cardinal. This time I forgive you. But in the future, I won't have any respect for M. de Treville, .. ... and my gratitude will not help you. You'll be hung without any arguments ... ... if you get in trouble again. I hope you understand me, gentlemen, as a sign of goodwill. You can leave now. He laughed at us. I will reserve one dog for him, from mine. - Everything went fine. - Treville did good. As usual. - Are you hurt? - No, not at all. Forgive my friends. What a girl. Yes, like a lightning love struck charming Constance ... and our handsome D'Artagnan. Come in. Oh, it's you Constance. What's the matter, you look worried. The Duke of Buckingham is in Paris, Madame. In Paris? Is that possible? I sent a message on behalf of Your Majesty ... ... and he come to respond to your request. My request? What request? What kind of secret? .. Maybe it's a trap? Why is it so hard to be stalked by... ... those who inspire my pure and sincere feelings... ... to find only despair, and possibly death. The Duke will come to see you tomorrow, if Your Majesty allow him. When it gets dark, go to him and tell ... ... that tomorrow the king should go hunting for two days. MILITARY AREA NO TRESPASSING. I follow all your instructions Father. I think you'll be happy. - Beware, the stairs. - Thank you, my son. Sorry. - Great, huh? - Yes, my son. - Look, what technique. - Yes. Next. Baton. LIGHT COMA. AVERAGE COMA. HEAVY COMA. DEATH. Well ... Well done. No, Rochefort, not the way they're doing. - I'm a little tired. - No, too much. - You too. - Give me ... I'll show you. Like this, ... with a reversal. No, not so much ... Look at me. No, not like that. Observe. Hand like this ... Look at me. Take here and beat like this ... Repeat. Repeat ... Rochefort. - No, Rochefort, all wrong. - But they are just learning. - Have you seen? - Incredible. - Terrible weapons. - This is terrible. With that new weapon they'll spoil our time. - Yes, we must find a way out. - I have an idea ... Come with me. Let's go, hammer. You want to kill me? You have to hit the nail. - Wait, what are you doing? - Concentrating. Yeah. Give it to me. So, a little bit better. Try it. Let them come with their batons. - It seems just right, you have to try. - I do not mind. You go. Good sound. Cardinal Richelieu appreciated pretty women ... ... specially those who helped him in carrying out his plans. Milady de Winter was one of such women. Yes, Your Eminence. I must tell you important news. - I hope so. - You be the judge. The Duke of Buckingham is in Paris. If the Duke in Paris, where is he hiding? Constance Bonacieux is a trustee of the Queen. If you do not lose track of her, especially tonight .. ... she will lead you directly to him. - What are you doing? - I'm calculating your master's expenses - How does it work? - Very simple. 42 Chicken ... Twist handles, pull over here. Then press the pedal. 44 crowns and 6 shillings. Fantastic machine. As it counts, it does not stop? - It's probably very difficult. - No. Need a little practice and all becomes clear. Very simple. 24 crowns and 2 is. - This account? - No, it's my cash. - Where's the bill? - Here is the bill. - The machine is just class. - Very clever. I hope they will finally pay me. Yes, yes. There they are. There they are. - Can you cut bread? - And you cry with onions. - We are hungry, innkeeper. - And dying of thirst. - What did you do for us? - I calculated a small account. No mistakes. write it down there, today dinner. - And the best wine we drink. - Well ... At least you acknowledge that you owe me this amount? Of course we recognize. Maybe you may sign me a receipt? No, because you owe us more. - How is it? Why? - Why? Because you house the best musketeers of the kingdom. - The king will pay you. - Excuse me, but I'm not the king. - On the contrary. - You're the king of chefs. - King of the winemakers. - King of the innkeepers. Long live the king. And now I'm feeling like the King. - Long live the king. - At ease. Meanwhile, Constance went to see Buckingham, .. ... obeying the Queen's orders. Oh, it's you? The providence has sent you down to me. Blessed be this providence. - Sir, if you only knew. - What, madam? I am being chased, and I ask you for protection. Seek protection elsewhere. Shut up, this woman has never asked for our help in vain. - Specially such a sweet woman. - For whom is worth dying for. The King and the Queen are in danger. The Cardinal Guardsmen are after me. Do not be afraid, madam. Gentlemen, for the King, for the Queen, and you, Madam. For you, Madam. One for all and all for one. It seems these swallows are not harbingers of good weather. Yes, we're going to have fun. Madam, if you please follow us by order of the Cardinal. Do not be afraid. This Lady is under our protection, gentlemen. That evening, our innkeeper experienced in his own skin, ... ...that housing the Musketeers doesn't always bring peace. They'll be all slaughtered, but will have to pay for everything. And for this, too. Here we go again. Let's maul them, squires. Wear helmets. Put the hat over. What do we do? You both go on that side, you come with me. - At your service, sir. - Glad to be. My favorite watch. Let us get a little closer. Packed. Dessert. I am ruined. Who will be next. What is it? Pour the broth into boots. Cool. What are you doing? Hot. - Where are you? - Here. - What have you got? - Baton. - Now what? - Mo...me, mo...you, moron. - She ran away. - To where. - No idea. We have to go after her. - There. A coach. - There's a coach. - What? - For kidnapping Constance. - For kidnapping Constance. - The coach rider is sleeping. - Let's take advantage of it. Wait Mosqueton. Where are you going? Come back. Help. Let me go. Stop. Take them at any price. Enter through the window, through the door... As you wish. It is finished for them. Grab them and send them to the Bastille. Do not be afraid... ... we have a few questions and just want you to answer them. It's them, Eminence. In this cold night, I wouldn't refuse a glass of wine to warm up. Come on, I'll keep you company. Who is the cuttie entertaining, Rochefort or the Cardinal? I think it's another reason. See the lights on, in the torture chamber. I think they're going to ask her some indiscreet questions. Come on. - All clear? - Let's get out. Help. I'm stuck. Help. -It's him we need to help. -Straighten me up! - Heard what they said? - We have to go after her. - No. - Is that the room's window? - Yes. - We must get around to the other side. - Yes, let's go. - It's the only window opened. - But how do we get there? - There is no choice, we must climb. - Come on, climb. - What are you waiting for? - Beware. - Come up, come up. - I'm trying. Careful. - You climb or not? - Yes, yes. I can't. I can not go. - Grab firmly so you don't fall. - Okay. - Okay. - A little bit more. Planchet. Come, Planchet, now it's your turn. Here I come. My ear ... I'm almost there, only a bit left. Hold on. I am done. - Climb up, I hold. - Are you sure? Mosqueton climb. Hurry up! My child, tell us everything about the Duke of Buckingham. I know that the Duke of Buckingham is a friend of France, Father. Of course, he is a friend of France. But maybe he is more friendly to the Queen? Climb. - You scratched me. - Serves you right. Help me. Everything went fine. stop. - Who ordered the torture? - Father Joseph. We're going to have fun. He likes to start by biting fingers. Do you remember? Lots of fun. The executioners. The torture chamber is at the end of this corridor. - Is it the only way? - Yes. - Only for the executioners? - Yes. I have an idea. Come with me. Wait. Now let's go. - Where to? - There. - What we do now? - Hide quickly. Understand, my child, the only way to avoid the worst... ... is to tell us where is the Duke of Buckingham? Only God knows where he is. Ask Him, and He will answer you. You're right, my child, I'm going to ask God ... ...and after a few minutes, He'll answer me through your mouth. Guards, Guards. Damned be you. Take her to the torture chamber. Eye to eye, will be more effective, Your Eminence. We will try. Guards, take her away. Not so rough. Easy, easy. - The bumps turned out great. - They look good on them. - Bazin. - Come on. Wait. There. - Can you keep it down. - Careful. Quiet, someone is coming. Take care of her. Go my child, go. Guards, I don't need your services anymore, you can go. Don't be afraid, it's us. Tie her to the table. To the table of torture hell. Hell, I said "hell" ... Damn it, I said "the devil". Lord, forgive me. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Tying her up to the table. You should tie her upside down, feet instead of the head, belly down. It is in the opposite way. This way, this place down God forgive me. I have sinned in thought. Lord, forgive me. I am guilty, I have sinned. My fault, everything my fault. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Sorry, sorry. Forgive me, forgive me. Do you forgive me? For this time? We are not going to hurt you, just scream out loud. What is it? Are you hurt? Stop. My daughter, don't make me dismember your sweet little body. Tell me everything you know. Do not be selfish. Tell me where is the Duke of Buckingham? - In England. - It can not be. She is lying, she is lying. Twist, no. No, let's go to the legs first. Tighten the legs. -You. Yes you. Pick up the tweezers, let's go fast. The large Tweezers. Yes, these. In the toes. That's it. Pull it. Oh, my foot. - Maybe this is better? - Not that. Better but not needed. Maybe we better saw? - No, we'll do this later. First, toes. Then we use the saw to cut and cut. Let's cut and cut, but the fingers first. This delicate little foot. Little cute little toes My daughter, tell me where is the Duke of Buckingham? - In London - It can't be, she lies. Pull, twist, break. More strength. Scream. Where is he? - In France. - He's already crossed the Channel. - Where in France? - I don't know, I don't know,... - You know. These small, beautiful, nice, soft... My daughter, where should the Duke meet with the Queen? Tell me, tell me. You do not want to talk? Pull, twist. No, stop. Want to say something? She will speak. Talk, my daughter, talk. The Duke of Buckingham is not the Queen's lover. - So who is the Queen's lover, who? - Cardinal Richelieu. Blasphemy and defamation. This woman is a demon. Is a witch. Let's burn her. Burn her like a witch. What are you waiting for? Lord, come to my rescue. - Give me a fire. - I forgot my lighter. My God, what a curse? Come to my aid. Maybe this will serve you now? What is this? - Large tweezers. - It hurts? - Very painful. Get up, get up! Take the clothes off. Take the clothes off quickly. What are you doing? - Don't be afraid. - I'm not afraid. Don't be afraid, don't be afraid. Well, Father, come on. Put this. Lie down, pull the legs, hands up. Maybe is not needed. What a beautiful foot. What? I can not hear. I think he likes it. Untie me, untie me. I think Father Joseph will not get anything from this girl. She will not tell him anything. Your Excellency can fully trust Father Joseph. He will make a mute talk. I am sure. I want the truth, Rochefort. And I don't care how we get it. Your Eminence, in this fight for the truth ... ... the means justify the end. Yes, it's true. Eventually we've got to have a confession from her. Certainly, she knows of something very useful for us. This interrogation has been going on for more than two hours. Let's see what's going on there. Eminence. What are you doing here, Father Joseph? - Where is she? - She ran away. - Where's your clothes? - They stole them. They attacked you and you didn't fight back? - I tried, but it was useless. - Oh my God. - You'll get a cold. - Yes. In this horrible torture chamber. You behaved like a boy, Father Joseph. I want an explanation right away. Your Eminence, I cannot deal with Satan. - This woman is possessed. - It's you that are, you should be rougher. This is unthinkable. Quick, quick, lift up this thing. Lift up, lift up! I need proof, but now everything is lost. The proof is still in Paris, the Duke of Buckingham. Very well, but where is he hiding? As the saying goes "looking for a woman." If we follow the queen, she will take us to the Duke. ...and who knows, with a little luck, they'll be alone. Our squires, together with Constance have found refuge ... ... in a small house inside the forest. It will take a while until you can return to the Louvre. Now it's our time to act. - We will serve the Queen for you. - Yes, but... - Come on, say it. - Don't you trust on us? You can say it now. Alright. Tomorrow night the Queen is going to see the Duke of Buckingham . You have to take him to her. You have to take him to the Louvre, through the main entrance. The password for the guards: Vendome and Carcassonne. Vendome and Carcassonne. But in the Queen's chambers, they only allow women. Do not worry about it. If all the troubles were that. - Here is the red curtain. - You are sure? Speak only in a soft voice. - Like this? - Yes, it's great. - Do you think she's there? - Sure, where else could she be. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Come in. Your Majesty. I'm a friend of Constance Bonacieux. She asked me to give a letter to Your Majesty. - Your name is Angela? - Yes, my Queen. - Majesty. - Your Majesty. Express my thanks to Constance. She was very wise by using your services... ... because here it is very dangerous for her. - Help me change. - I'm afraid. I can't do it. It's very simple. Open the zip on the back. Constance should have told you ... ... not to be afraid. I trust you, and you will have to carry out my orders. - There will be no problem. - Be careful, do not tighten so much. I can't hear anything... I should have gone, not him. Hurry up. You are very clumsy. Pour water from the pitcher into the basin, and wet the towel. Hurry up! What is up? You don't need to wash, it's me. Come here. Now, the other side. Put the braid ... ... behind the back. What are you doing? What is the problem? - It's hot here. Are you sick? I'm going to pass out, I'm dizzy. - You're not pregnant by accident? - No. Fortunately, it's impossible. You want to drink something? A little bit of water. My beautiful slender blonde. If I wasn't on duty. - You are improving. - I try, Your Majesty. Did you understand what I said? Everything must be done by the book. - You can fully trust me. - Great. Planchet and Grimaud took care of transportation. Oh, oh, stop. - What happened? - I can not anymore. This kind of torture. I can not stand. - We have to hurry. - I can't. What's it? .. Were we arrested? Excuse me, my Lord, look behind you. Oh God!. Time to charge batteries to proceed. Hurry up, please hurry up. Of course, talking is easy. We arrived. Please follow me my Lord. Certainly. No trespassing. - What about Vendome and Carcassonne! - That's another story. And if I add that I'm under the patronage of the Queen! It changes everything. Let them go. This way Sir. Come. Come. Quickly. This is Gertrude, the Queen's second maid. - She will lead you to her - Very well. Follow me, my Lord. Having at his disposal only tools of the time ... ... Father Joseph made holes on all walls and ceilings... ... to listen to what was happening in the Queen's chambers. - This is Angela, the first Queen's maid. - My lord. Yes? The door opened. Madam, I know that love is madness, and I lost my mind. But not everything is lost, as long as I see you. I agreed to see you ... ... just to beg you not to see me anymore. Promise me? Madam, I don't promise anything that I can't do. From the first day I saw you, my life was turned upside down. I lost my mind. If you could forget me. Never, Madam, never. I am ready to declare war on France, to see you again. Now we can arrest him. I'm not afraid of anything. There are thousands, millions of people, willing to die ... ... just to keep my happiness. I share these noble feelings, but please, leave now. Leave now. Very well, as a sign of your affection for me ... ... would you be able to give me something... ... to remind me that this meeting was not a dream. - And then you leave for England? - I swear I'll do it right away. Here you have it, my Lord. Keep this to remember me. Necklace of pendants, which is the sign of our first meeting. - I think it's time. - Without delay. For the Cardinal, let's go. For the King, for France. Majesty, Rochefort and the guards are coming. Lock the door with the bolt. We're lost. The guards are coming. What do we do? Help the Duke to escape. Majesty. Sir, remove your pants. - What should I do? - You have to take your pants off. Are you sure now is the right time? Yes, the right time. We have to exchange clothes. You put mine and I put yours. - Nobody. - Let's break the door down. Do not. This is the Queen's apartment. What's all this noise about?. What is going on? Your Majesty, your life is in danger. There is a man in your apartment. - You are crazy? - Not, in no way, Your Majesty. It's me, Father Joseph. I saw a man come in here. Sir, take off your pants. It is for the Queen's honor. I know, but not by the same degree. Oh my God! Put this clothes on as fast as you can. You are in danger, there's a man in there. Speak louder. A man entered your room, Majesty. Don't forget the hours. That's it, okay. - And you, who are you? - Father Joseph. Father Joseph is not here. Of course I'm not there, I am here. - Prove me. - I'm here with Count of Rochefort. - Yes it's me. - Who? - The Count of Rochefort. - Speak louder. - Count of Rochefort. - Rochefort, ... okay. I will distract the guards, disguised as you. - The hat. - Put on the hat. The Duke of Buckingham would never appear in public, without a hat. Lord, what will become of us. -Sir, for the Queen, may God protect you. - Good luck. Open your Majesty. There's a man in there. He is a spy. Look there. It's him. After him. Get him. - Cover the mustache. - The mustache? This is my dignity. God save the Queen. Let's go. Nobody. Come. Wait for me. - There he is. - After him. Through there or here? Thank you. - Rochefort. - Yes. We have to separate. Half goes with you that way the rest comes with me. Come with me. Not everybody, Rochefort, half comes with me. Come with me. You again, my cuttie. You bastard! How cheeky, we are decent ladies. They 're angry. When I touch them, they never complain. - The Musketeers are coming. - Not the musketeers, it's the Duke. Depressa, depressa. Hurry, hurry. Hurry up. - My God, what did you do? - This way will be faster. Buckingham left the Queen's room, Your Eminence. He looks anguished. I gave orders that nobody get out of the Louvre. My God, what happened again? We have to move fast. They're chasing us, we have to escape. - Let's go. - We have to put our shoes to run. - Wait. - Are you okay? Better than never. As you see, this way is easier. - When you're tired, tell me. - I'll let you know. - How are you? - I'm doing the job. The Duke will not take it much longer. If there is trouble, we'll help. - Father, we got him. - Hold him tight. This way, we'll take him to the Cardinal. - Follow me. - Let's go, let's go. Move! Leave me alone. Take your hands off. Finally, we catch him Eminence. Here is the Duke of Buckingham. This? The Duke of Buckingham? Are you crazy? How did this scoundrel trick you, posing as the Duke When he ran down the hall we thought it was the Duke. Certainly Father Joseph, the devil himself deceives you. Take this imposter to the Bastille. He will have the same end of the four Musketeers. But why? Well, that's what happened. I pretended to be the duke, we changed clothes ... He managed to escape and I came to keep you company. - A thing worth doing - A noble deed. Not to mention the Queen's honor. - Of course, she is a formidable woman. - Nobody here doubts. One thing that bothers me is ... ... when I get out of jail I will have to find another servant. - Why? - Because you will have been hanged. This can not happen. Meanwhile, hidden in the woods in a wooden hut ... ...our Constance, and her animals await the arrival of her friends. - So, what are the news? The Duke took the Queen's necklace and set out for England ... ... saying he will never forget of this adventure. - It's a good new. The Queen also will never forget what you did for her. Exactly for this reason, we need to see her urgently. Because our master Musketeers and our friend are in the Bastille. The Queen would never allow the execution of those who fought for her. - We have to help them escape. - From the Bastille? It's impossible. There is a way, but it is not easy. If the Queen lends us clothing and transportation, a coach ... ... a beautiful coach, the best coach. why are you so nervous? I'm not nervous, I'm perfectly calm. I feel uncomfortable with this outfit. This is very risky. It is impossible to escape the Bastille, without exposing yourself to risk. The Queen could help us more, for what we did for her. - She helps us ... this coach. - We arrived. Let's go. We need to see the person in charge, the boss, the foreman ... - The commander. - The commander. His Majesty, the King. We want to see the Musketeers... ... D'Artagnan, Athos, Porthos and Aramis. I am the temporary commander and I don't know the prisoners by heart. Here they are. All in the same cell. - Do you want me to bring them here? Yes. His Majesty wants to interrogate them personally. I see. I will tell the chief of the guards to bring them right away. - Did you see the chief of the guards? - Yes, he went down to the prison. Thank you. So far so good. Now he will bring them and everything will be fine. Don't light firecrackers before the party. Attention, halt! Right, turn! - Rochefort surrenders your guard. - Rochefort, it's yours. Left turn, ahead march! One ... two, one ... two. - Mathurin. - I'm here. what is it? Bring me the five prisoners from cell 27. - The 4 Musketeers and the other? - Yes and quickly. Yes sir. What is this noise? It seems the sound of a coach. We're screwed. That's what we needed! - Let's go. - That way, let's go that way. Take us to the commander. - Where are the stairs taking? - I think directly to the prison. Are you sure? Do you think they will take to the balcony? - I remember... - Then, let's move. His Majesty, the King. Is this always without anyone? Forgive me Your Majesty, I thought the Commander was here. - I'm going to look for him. - And fast. No way out. Go back. That way. - Not here either. - Back. They should advise the Cardinal to wear mini-skirts. They just passed by. If I get caught with this clothes I'll be hanged. Enough, no more whining. You're a cry-baby. Yes, I'm scared. So what? Sorry for the delay, Majesty, I spoke to the chief of the guards ... ... and soon he will be here with the prisoners. Where did I leave my glasses? Who is this lunatic? What a petulance, didn't they teach you that the King deserves respect? - His Majesty. - Here, His eminence. His Eminence. - This is Father Joseph. - Father Joseph. Are you the commander? No, Your Majesty. I'm temporarily performing the duties. Now, everything is clearer. - Do you like your work? - Yes, very much. Very well. You'll work here untill you die. The prisoners are out there, sir. Do I send them in? Why? The commander told me to bring them here. What a coincidence. For a moment I had a bad impression of you. You have a good intuition. Brother Joseph, remind me to reward this keen employee.. - Your Majesty is very kind. - Send them in. Come in. The fate of these four, we'll decide later. My Lord, they deserve a severe punishment. Everything has its time. Their crime is nothing compared to this scoundrel. If you tell me on whose behalf you entered the Queen's room ... ... you will have my mercy. Otherwise, you will throw up the truth, under torture ... ... and then you'll be hanged. Well, are you talking? I gave you a chance and you refused. Well... it's your choice. This silence will cost your life. Take them back to the cell. Let's go gentlemen. Majesty, we must prepare these men to death. Go Father, I don't want to deprive the last confession... ... even to those who don't deserve. Who knows, by their last words you may something interesting. Who knows, Majesty. Where did they take the prisoners? That way, Father. Thank you. It was Father Joseph. He went to give them the last confession before they are hanged. - Yes, our works are bad. - On the contrary, they are very good. - I have an idea. - what idea? It is an expression of "divide to rule". I have to go, see you later. What did he say? - I don;t know. - Because of him we end up hanged. - We'll see. At the Louvre, in the private apartment, a man in the Queen's room. - And this idiot refuses to speak. - Obviously, he's a spy, Majesty. He'll pay with his life for his action. Let me pray. I will ask God, to make this poor creature ... ... confess everything to Father Joseph, and that, in his infinite mercy ... ... God grant forgiveness to who ... ... will punish with human justice. Father Joseph. It was Father Joseph. No, Eminence, you probably fall by accident. I didn't fall by accident. I saw his face. - Father Joseph. - No, it's me. - Well? - I set the plan in motion. -I don't understand anything. - I kicked the Cardinal in the back. Do this to me. I trusted him completely. - What are you talking about? - Father Joseph, Majesty. - I think your mind is stunned. What are you saying? Yes, Your Majesty, Father Joseph just kicked me. - A kick? - Right in the place, Majesty. In the ass? It's not possible? This is a cause for concern. It never happened. We have to exorcise the demon out of him. But Father Joseph was not here. No one came in or went out. I assure you, Majesty, he ran away. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. He came here and ran. I'll look for him to explain this outrage to me. As you wish. Father Joseph, Father Joseph. It's Cardinal's voice. - Oh, no. - It worked! Father Joseph. Father Joseph. It's not that hard. - Are you sure? - Go. Father Joseph, where are you? Father Joseph, where are you? The King? Was the King. Something strange is going on. They're all crazy. This is impossible. It's impossible. Holy Virgin Mary. My God, the Blessed Virgin Mary, to the Apostles, this is impossible. This is impossible. It's impossible. - It was a torpedo? - It wasn't supposed to hurt. Did you see where the commander went? I saw him go down with the prisoners. Lord, make that ... ... the insanity of our King be fleeting. Give his sanity back. Father Joseph, where are you? Eminence? Father Joseph? I am going to give a torpedo on the king's ass. You always choose the best targets. Bazin, I don't. It's a question of luck. Father Joseph. Where are you? Eminence. The Cardinal? What game is this? Yes what? Eminence, this smells of betrayal. Where are you, Eminence? Eminence. It worked, it worked.... - Maybe we should get away with it? - No, my idea worked. The King, the King again. My God, if you can't grant my request ... ... about restoring his sanity tell me what I should do? The foundation of the throne of Louis XIII is shaken. It's your foundation that is shaken. I just did justice. - Now, we are even. - Of course we're even, Majesty. But could you explain to me what are we even of? And could you explain to me Eminence,... ... how dare you lift a leg against me? I never did such, Majesty. You insulted me by kicking me ... ... like Carlos sick in the hunt, like Carlos six in the hunt ... ... Carlos VI in the hunt. And what does Carlos VI have to do here? Your behaviour resembles that when Carlos VI lost his head. I know. So what? Misfortune struck France. Eminence, calm down. We don't need to dramatize. - None of us is crazy. - Majesty, it's all the devil's works. It seems the Prince of Darkness took the Bastille by storm. Yes, yes. What day is it? - Fourteenth of July. - Fourteenth of July, very well. He didn't talk. He did not say anything. He didn't talk. He didn't talk. Hi did not say anything. I'm going to the prison. Wait a little and follow me further. Let's. The King's orders must be strictly enforced. Yes, commander. No contact with anyone. I am responsible for them. Stop, stop. Release them. The King wants to take the five prisoners. Two minutes ago he said something quite different. Are you challenging the King for changing his mind every 2 minutes? Maybe you want the King himself, give you the order. No, no. I'm going to release you. If it's the King's order, release them. You are free, you can go. Rest, you will like this. Eminence, we aren't going to stay here the rest of our lives? We need to find the commander. Do not worry, I think it's him. No, it's father Joseph. He looks a little weird. I beg you, sir, do not pay attention to him. It's my last word. My Lord, my Lord. Let's not interfere with Father Joseph during prayer. Look for the commander, and ask him to prepare the trip back. It will be done Majesty. Father Joseph, Father Joseph, get up. - Was it your Majesty? - No, not me. Eminence, why did you do that? The temptation was very great. And then, didn't you, Majesty, do the same to me? - Ah, was you, Eminence? - Yes, it was me. Let's forget this. Now we're even. In what are we even, Eminence? That's because you submitted me to the same treatment. - Meu? - Yes. I was with the prisoners all the time. Ask the commander. You did the same to me in this same place. Never. God knows I didn't do that. - That was not me. - No, you kicked me. No, I didn't. - The key is in the door, lock it - Here, take it. This way, quickly. Let's go. Since you were not the author of such an outrage ... .. to my dignity, I implore you to accept my apologies, Father Joseph. And I would like our friendship not to end because of this. The Lord tells us to give the left cheek when they hit us on the right. Hurry, gentlemen Musketeers. In summary, each of us was kicked... ... but nobody remembers to do so. Yes sir. This is the work of the devil. Yes, it is the work of the devil, making fun of us. Come and see Father Joseph. Eminence, come and see. Do something. Father Joseph, what are you saying? But Majesty... We are locked Majesty. Open up. Open up. Open in the name of the King. We would love to, but we don't have the keys. Have patience. We have already called a locksmith. Majesty, they already sent for a locksmith. That's wonderful, Eminence. We are locked in the Bastille. - We barely got away. - But it's not over yet. This is just the biginning. Because the Queen is not very smart. What was the idea of giving the necklace to the Duke of Buckingham. And now let's go and relax a bit. We can't tell you everything now ... And if you want to know what happened next ... ... to all the characters. Watch the Second Part. Good bye. END Part One
