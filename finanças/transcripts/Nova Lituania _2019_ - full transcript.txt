Having been through so much, having witnessed so much, our Nation is still holding its head high. This year marks the 20th anniversary of Lithuania's Independence. As you bid farewell to the Military Academy, your alma mater, its image will forever remain in your memories. The skies of peace have been gloomy lately. Neither we nor anyone in the world can tell what tomorrow will bring. But a hard-working, united, and disciplined nation can survive even a global tide. You, the young Lieutenants, have been raised and educated by a free Lithuania. We, the elders, are counting on you, just as the Nation counted on us 20 years ago. Your determination to carry out your duty... Draw only when needed, sheathe only with honour. Algimantas Česnulevičius! - Remarkable. - Steponavičius. Was he killed or wounded? Wounded, but he died before the doctor arrived. What was he doing on our soil? We're not sure. Might be a provocation. He was shot in the bushes. Maybe he was just taking a leak. ...referendum that was going to be held on Sunday. The ultimatum for the Chancellor of Austria... The speech was excellent. Everyone said that the speech was excellent. Here's one for the Riflemen's Union. And for the Agriculture Summit. I also need one for the University. We're going there tomorrow, remember? I remember. I'll write it out. Why is Švėgžda so tense? I don't know. Is something up? Perhaps. Meaning...? What's the problem, Jonas? So the Pole fired first? Apparently, yes. We'll announce that they fired first, case closed. Mr. President, our border patrol shot a Polish border patrol. They have done this to us too. Have you heard what they chant in the streets? What? "Marshal, lead us to Kaunas." They'll give it up soon. Right? Alright, what do you suggest? To concede. Are you kidding me?! We've been saying "no Vilnius, no rest" for 20 years now, and now we'll give in because of a single soldier? Please find a solution and let me know. I don't want to hear about this anymore. - You're sure they'll issue an ultimatum? - Of course. Why else would they refuse to investigate the incident on the border? - What about the League of Nations? - It's useless. Nobody wants a war. They'll recommend we concede. The Army...? - Against eighty thousand? - You should've told him that. - Why didn't you? - I was always calling for talks! I offered negotiations, the Trilateral Council. Talking through the ambassadors, setting up a secret negotiation. He dismissed everything. And now what? We should have thought about our size and the size of our neighbours. "You come up with solution"... If we concede to the Poles, everyone will think that we're here for the taking. We'll be invaded by the Germans or Russians. Or the Russians invade Poland, And the Germans invade us. Or the Russians invade us, and the Germans invade Poland. Or... Both the Russians and Germans invade us... When did that pain return? The day before yesterday. Any other numbness, besides the hand? Yesterday it was my shoulder, and today it's my jaw as well. Any pain when you breath? A little bit. I'm afraid your blood's clotting. - We need to operate. - It's not a good time... When is a good time? It is either an operation, or a heart attack. Or a stroke. Could we postpone it somehow? I really can't take off work now. Would you prefer someone wiping up your spittle every day? I'll prescribe 150 mg of aspirin. Daily, to thin your blood. And lie down for at least 15 minutes every few hours. In complete relaxation. - Good bye. - Thank you, doctor. Good bye. Deprived of substance, a form becomes very susceptible to external forces. Just like a helium balloon. Poke it with a needle, and it's gone. Now, if you fill the balloon with sand, you can poke all you like, just a few tiny grains will fall out. The same goes for states. That's where the concepts of density and capacity become so important. The insufficiently populated areas are impossible to safeguard. Emptiness is our worst enemy. This is where our similarity to the Black Continent becomes apparent. The visual semblance goes without saying: Lithuania is mimicking an African outline, as if in a concave mirror. Except that, in the place of the island of Madagaskar, we have our Capital that has been drowned by a sea known as Poland. Just like vast under-populated areas of Africa once drew the white colonists, so are we in the same situation. When our demographic density is 3-4 times less than that of our neighbours, it makes us an easy target for either peaceful or aggressive colonisation. Pardon me. - I'm very sorry. Am I interrupting? - I've got a lecture. When do you finish? - Half an hour to go. - I must leave. - It's about the President's visit. - About what? Please, could you step outside, I'll be quick. I'll be back in a minute. This is it. The President comes in through here, greeted by students and professors, maybe me and the rector, if he joins us. Then we accompany him this way, towards the Great Lecture Hall. So you could set up right here. We can put a table. Or two, if you need. And you can arrange your things in any way you see fit. A banana tree, maybe? Or some of those exhibits of yours? You see, we need to make an instant impression on him. Why is he coming? To commemorate the Corporate anniversary. But I hope we might touch on the matter of funding. What do you say? What are you up to? Looking for something to bring to the University tomorrow. The Dean asked me to. What for? It's the Corporate Anniversary. The President's coming. How much did he ask you to bring? Why? I was thinking, maybe we could clear it out a bit. Clear what out? The room. What? We could take out the rugs... and these desks, too. The books you no longer need. What for? We could prepare it for Mother. The whole room for your Mother? Yes, why? No, I just... I thought your Mother could sleep in the dining room? My Mother, in the dining room? Right, maybe not. We could also repaint the walls, touch it up a bit. Get some new furniture, a new bed for example. And take out these plants. No way, the plants won't survive in this weather. They're tropical. Maybe put them in another room? Maybe she won't mind the plants... or will she? It's my Mother. Dinner's ready. Feliksas? - What's your name again? - Feliksas Gruodis. Gruodis... Gruodis... Ona, please send that man in. Feliksas Gruodis, Lithuanian University Faculty of Mathematics and Natural Sciences, Department of Geography. Pleased to meet you. Have a seat please. I'm here to ask for support from the Government. Support? What for? I know how it sounds, but... I've already been to the Ūkis Bank Manager, Ministries of Finance and Foreign Affairs. None of them took me seriously. So I thought, you... You're a man of great intellect. Hence me barging in like this... Go on, I'm listening. I believe that we... We're running out of time, as a state. What do you mean? One of our great neighbours will simply swallow us. What makes you think so? Don't take it the wrong way. I don't mean to criticize you. I do have a solution. Backup Lithuania. A Lithuanian colony overseas. Excuse me? A backup state in case something happens to this one. The hearing of the Energy Legislation... I've got it all outlined, with the potential costs of buying such land overseas. I understand, it's not the right time. You can find me at the Geography Department. It's Professor Gruodis. This will be your room, Mother. So you prepared it on my account? No, we've been planning the renovation for some time. Just that Feliksas started with this room. - So you did this yourself? - Yes. Dining room... There's the bathroom, when you need it. Kitchen. - What's over there? - Our bedroom. No, in the back. Oh, that's Julytė's room. Whose? Feliksas' cousin's daughter is staying with us. You never told me that. Could I get you anything to drink? Water, please. I'll get it. What is that bird? African grey parrot. Very rare species. How was your trip? Exhausting. Are you an only child or do you have siblings? I do, a brother and a sister. That's a big family. Younger or older? I'm the youngest. - Where are they now? - Helping our parents on the farm. - So your parents are farmers? - Yes. How did you end up here with your uncle and aunt? It was uncle's idea. It's her last year in the High School. Soon she'll enter the University so I figured she'll need a place in Kaunas anyway. What are your plans in Kaunas? I don't know yet. Depends on the situation. - I could help if... - Thank you. No need. Don't rush, child. Mind your manners. What's this word? Savants. Meaning students and teachers. I was trying to find an all-encompassing word. It's good. Pretty good. Just a little correction here, maybe? All good otherwise. I had to preside over the Council of Ministers this morning. Draw some guidelines for the next half year. I don't know... I don't know what to tell them. What can I say if we may be gone in six months? Jonas, don't you start panicking too. Should've given more to military, not education. We wouldn't have this ultimatum. What matters is that we stick together. It's all about unity now, Jonas. This way people won't need to look for culprits. I mean, whose fault is this? Nobody's fault. Things just happened. There's a storm over the country. And in a storm... What was it? "In a storm, you must trust the helmsman." Well, there you go. We will sail through. How, Juozas? We'll figure it out. The newspaper claims that after the fall of Shanghai, Nanjing and Adis-Abeba, Vienna is next in line. However, the German appetite might grow. And now for some sports news. Lithuania's basketball team, the current leader in Europe, had a second chance in Tallinn yesterday, where it played Estonia. The game that was so eagerly anticipated, especially in Lithuania, ended with a triumphant victory by Lithuania... - You must be joking. - Careful with this box. - I said just a few things. - You wanted to impress him. - Feliksas! - I'm only showing a few things. - Greetings, Your Excellency, - Pleased to meet you. Ilzė Noreikienė. - She just started a course on Genetics. - Pleased to meet you. Orestas Vaišnoras. Not only a mathematician, but also a choir leader. - Very pleased to meet you. - He runs our Student Choir. Pleased to meet you. This is Prof. Feliksas Gruodis. Pleased to meet you. One of the founders of the science of geography in Lithuania. Head of the Lithuanian Geographical Society. You probably know him as the author of numerous speeches ​​and texts, a visionary, full of eccentric, if sometimes odd ideas and fantasies. We're very proud to have him with us. Now, let us proceed. We have witnessed time and again, how universities become the think-tanks for libertine and even destructive ideas. It is therefore my wish that our corporate youth, loyal to the leader of the Nation, help curb the budding discontent amongst students. For the ideal of a Nation to be real, the Nation must be united, organised, tight-knit, avoiding slap-dash, and uniformly educated. After all, the education that you get at the university is dedicated to the life of the Nation. Thus a scientific thought must be cultivated not only in the lecture halls, but outside of them as well. By working this way, the idealism will not lose its perception of reality. It may not be always convenient for personal reasons to go where one doesn't feel like going, but you can't have gaps in life. Let us, therefore, leave no gaps in our studies. May our University be like a blooming flower, and our savants in it like those hard-working bees. And now please welcome our University's Pan Flute Band. Please. Sir? Mr. Prime Minister! The Lithuanian Government accepted the Polish request to restore the diplomatic relations that were cut almost two decades ago due to the Polish occupation of Vilnius. Opposing the conditions of the ultimatum and taking the responsibility for the Government's decision, PM Jonas Servus and his entire Cabinet have resigned. Retractor. Some sources claim that the acceptance of the Polish ultimatum might put an end to the Lithuanian aspirations to regain the country's historical capital. However, dark hours only strengthen... Forceps. The Nation's support for it's leader, President Juozapas Palionis. Has anyone else read it? No. Why didn't you tell me about this before? I was hoping we still had time. But now, after Czechoslovakia... I see. You're right. This is quite an idea, it's really something... - How long have you been working on it? - Five years. It's very well put, so convincing. Especially the part about our situation. The dead-end, the helplessness, the threats... - So you will run it? - Absolutely. This is just an abstract. I'll let you read the full text. - We can't be the first, though. - What? This should be published by one of the provincial papers. It will cause an uproar, no doubt about that. Then we will have to react, saying, this or that published Prof. Gruodis' controversial idea. Only then we can publish your idea, due to the uproar. Hold on, Stasys. It's all so complicated. - You're a news agency, aren't you? - But this isn't news. Even if I allow it... Distribute it in the evening to all the newspapers and the radio. It won't pass the censorship. The entire country will be talking about it in the morning. We have guidelines from above. Those above won't care who published it, Stasys! Trust me, Feliksas, if only it was up to me... The President's Office is impossible to deal with as it is. I'm already getting calls every day. “Why did you publish this or that?“ You're either with him or you're an enemy. And this is really dubious! Excuse me. "Backup Lithuania." How is one meant to take that? I don't even know how he might respond. - Hello, Feliksas. - Hi. London is digging trenches and distributing gas masks. - Do we run it? - Yes. And the one about Czechoslovakia? The Germans are in Prague. Sure, run it. The Osservatore Romano has a polemic about Germany annexing Klaipėda... Valius, that's all hypothetical. We're a news agency. We run facts. We deal with what happened, not with what might happen. We don't do predictions. What are you, a rookie? - No, I'm not. - Finished? - Yes, I am. Look, I guess I better try the regional press. That's what I'm talking about. They have less pressure on them, it'll be easier. Ask Šalkovskis to make more copies. Thank you. I would like to post these. - Where to? - All the regional periodicals. But that's a lot of addresses. It's fine. Could I also get 45 envelopes, please? Here you are. One, two, three, four... How's your heart? Like a rock. They say it feels like jelly after a heart attack. Oh, I feel much better now. Much better... Please understand, I... I never wanted to sack you. - I was forced by circumstances. - I know, it's my fault. My heart... I had to give the people at least some sign of change. On one hand, the President's staying, there's stability. But also the Government assumes responsibility for the Poles... I understand. Now the Germans... Threatening to take Klaipėda... We're trying to figure it out. Here... They've released an LP with my best speeches. Limited edition, for special occasions. - Thanks. - I wanted you to have it. Urbonas can't write them like you did. How's Urbonas? He's a priest. - And as a politician? - A zero. - Same as me. - No, Jonas. You were miles ahead of him. I'd like you back. What about Urbonas? Not in the Government. The Bank. The Bank? Government may be difficult considering your health. I think the Bank would be just right. It's your expertise. Urbonas can't get along with the Bank Manager about increasing the state's spending. We need our man in the Bank. But we were always saving rather than spending. We need to spend now. To show people that something's improving. We need to renovate, build things. So that everyone could see. Jonas, you're the best I have. Deprived of substance, the form becomes very susceptible to external forces. Just like a helium balloon. Poke it with a needle, and it's gone. Now, if you fill the balloon with sand, you can poke all you like, just a few tiny grains will fall out. The same goes for states. That's where the concepts of density and capacity become so evident. Insufficiently populated areas are impossible to safeguard. Emptiness is our worst enemy. See if you can spread this idea among the student organisations. Students should be interested in that sort of thing. - What sort of thing? - You'll get it once you've read it. I think we should set up a committee or something to support this idea. It requires a lot of money. I could give a series of lectures if anyone's interested. People would understand better what we're facing and why this is necessary. Perhaps we could do some charity events. Is your father in America now? Yes. Maybe he could help promote this among our diaspora. They're nostalgic about Lithuania and might contribute to its salvation. What salvation, Professor? Just read it, then we'll talk. Okay. Come to me as soon as you've read it. Okay. This is really important. We got that. - You're not leaving yet? - In a minute. I'll wait for you in the lobby. It's a sort of petition. I've written it all out. All I need is signatures. Let me quickly read it for you. "We, signed below, are deeply concerned "about the current state of affairs, "the security, the near future, and the existence of our country "which we see as being under the following threats." And then I list all the threats that we've talked about. "Backup Lithuania" would ensure the continuation of the state "in the event of occupation or invasion, "and present a great opportunity to re-launch some of the state-building works "that have taken a wrong direction in our country. "It is only natural for most people to have the desire to start anew." "Therefore, in the present circumstances, "when our country will soon have to choose between a costly resistance "and a tremendous shame of surrender, we propose a third option - "the "Backup Lithuania." Well? I don't know, it sounds... somewhat hysterical. I can tweak the wording. I'm not talking about the wording. Look, why don't we talk over a glass of beer? I can't, Feliksas. Birutė's school is having their Spring Festival. We have to make a mask. I'm just asking for your signature. I don't know, Feliksas. This idea of yours... The more intellectuals sign it, the more likely the Administration will take the petition seriously. You want to bring this to the President? I've already been everywhere else. Who's signed it? No one so far. So far... - Why did you give her that shirt? - What shirt? The patterned one she wore during dinner. What's wrong with it? Nothing. It's a nice shirt. The kid wanted to look pretty. What's wrong? I bought her a nice new shirt. Why did you need to take that one? I didn't take anything, she found it herself. How did she find it? It was in a drawer. We were looking for a towel for Mother. I opened a drawer and the shirt was lying on top, so she saw it. It's too big for her. That's exactly why she likes it. Let her have it, what's the big deal? Feliksas, you got it for me when I was pregnant. Why didn't you throw it away, like everything else? Because you got it for me. Elena, connect me to the President, please. Yes, sure. OK, I'll wait. Juozas, it's me. Hello. I have reviewed the budget plan. It's completely different from what we discussed. It's not Urbonas' decision, Juozas, it's yours. Juozas, it's just a waste of money! We need to do something substantial instead of wasting so much on... some sports hall. This may be the last championship in Europe, and we're just throwing money at it. I told you that... It's just an example. I see. Alright, I get it. OK, fine. Do you like it? - Very much. - Glad to hear it. So what did you want to talk about the other day? Diffusion. Beg your pardon? Diffusion is a fundamental law in natural sciences. The basis for everything. Yes? Emptiness attracts fullness. I'm not sure I follow you. Do you live in a private house? - In a flat. - How big is it? 250 square meters. With your wife and daughter? That's right. That makes three people in 250 square metres, correct? Correct. A bit too much. It's a governmental flat. Now imagine that next door, people are cramped in a one bedroom flat. Plus, they live with someone who tells them what to do, all day and all night. Your house is full of flats like this. And all dwellers are aware that in a spacious flat nearby there's only you, after a heart attack, your wife, daughter and a poor lock on the door. What do you think they would do? Diffusion. Emptiness attracts fullness. It's too crowded in here. Not here. I mean the Lithuanian neighbours. How's that? Do you know the density of Lithuanian population? One person per 20,000 square metres. Whereas our great neighbour states are 3 to 4 times denser than us. Unless the density of the Lithuanian population matches that of our neighbours, we'll always be at risk of colonisation, whether peaceful or not. You can stop anywhere around here. After you. Today empty spaces and unpopulated areas are much rarer than, say, 30-50 years ago. In our climate zone there is no free space at all. However, the so-called New World still contains some small fertile areas with decent climate. This is me in Central Quebec, 1924. Unfortunately, while I was raising funds for the expedition, it was rather densely populated by local Frenchmen. In 1927, we went to explore São Paulo State in Brazil. However they wouldn't give us the cultural autonomy. 1930, Angola. Peace River Valley in Alberta, Matanuska Valley in Alaska... So all this time you've been looking for...? Not all this time. Since 1933, give or take. I saw what was going on in Germany, I went to a geographers' congress in the Soviet Union. You see, to them, we were always insignificant. A glimpse of meteor in this area. And it's about to go out, unless we light it up elsewhere. East Africa, Tanganyika, Mozambique, Angola. Watch out, it's poisonous. I'm joking. I think it's best to stay away as far as possible from the big nations. Geographical isolation - economical communication. Sea as both a trade route and a natural border. I've set my eyes on nine islands now. It's all here. Comparative statistics, calculations. Here are some maps. This is all I've ever written on the subject. I already watered them, Mother. These plants need more water. Can't you tell? Did you redo the floorboards in the other room? We did. Right in the middle. It's very obvious. Needs to be fixed. And that spot needs waxing. - What spot? - Right here. Look at this and then the rest of the room. Just a minute! - Good morning. - Good morning. I've read it all. I've got a few questions. Most of these islands you are suggesting are in tropical climates. Like I said, no more vacant spots in our climate zone. I'm talking about distance, not climate. Look, 2,800,000 citizens... Let's say, one ship can take 500. That's 5600 ships. We've got two of our own, we'd rent 48 ships from the Danes and Swedes. We'd need roughly 112 trips. The return trip takes two weeks. That's more than two years to relocate all of Lithuania. - You've misunderstood. - Have I? I am not offering to relocate, I am offering to start anew. What do you mean, anew? Look... Teachers, doctors, engineers, agronomists, architects - people the state cannot function without - that's who we send to the newly acquired place. That would be a start. A single ship would suffice. I don't get it. We have a chance to build everything anew instead of fixing what's been poorly built. And what exactly has been poorly built? The same people would be working over there. All I'm saying is if we managed to do better than here, people would come on their own. - How? - What? What would that be like? I understand it technically and theoretically, but practically...? It's best to go there by ship. You get somewhat acclimatised on the way. It gets warmer, sunnier gradually. And then you see the shore. Plants on top of each other, as if they're anxious to meet you. - See what I mean? - Trying to. You feel like you're coming home. Even though the place is unfamiliar, you feel like home. The Talipot palm. It bears fruits and dies. But it lives for 60 years until then. We don't have that long. If we don't bear fruits now, we will perish. Everything is ready-made here: Agriculture, industry, language, culture, literature... Everything in this continent is determined by the sense of finitude. Sense of an end. But to be able to create, one must feel that nothing has been done before. Our people, scattered around the world, don't want to come back, because they know how it's going to end here. Our choices, political and military, as those dark clouds are nearing, have but one outcome and we're well aware of it. I, meanwhile, am proposing an option that's unpredictable. Therefore, unpreventable. It has never happened before so it's difficult to respond to. They won't be able to use their plans, doctrines, their perfected scenarios. We are going to take a completely new, untrodden path that no one has ever taken. And Backup Lithuania is going to be a state like no other. A state like never before. This is madness. Every madness began as a rational decision. And vice versa: every great decision started as madness. I always thought we were a poor country. My folks taught me to save for a rainy day. Do you know what they called you for saving during the crisis? I know. But look at this now. Money is not the problem. What is, then? - Mother's not home? - No. Where is she? Out to meet somebody. - Where were you two? - At the cinema. Why didn't you take me with you? It just... slipped my mind. Besides, your Mother... - What did you see? - A French film. - Did you like it? - Julytė did. Auntie? Have you seen that patterned shirt? What shirt? The one uncle gave me. I put it in the wash. Why don't you wear something else? What is it? Veronika? Mother waxed the floor with that shirt. She thought it was a rag. The things I went through to raise you... Why are you telling me this, Mother? I didn't ask for help. I told myself I'd do anything for my baby. For you. But since the day you were born I just wanted one thing in life: for you to have a normal family and not be like me. I do have a family, Mother. What are you talking about, Veronika? You call this a family? Taking care of someone else's child for a couple of months? You're still young, you can still have children. - Mother, I'm forty. - So what? Your doctor told you plain and simple. It's his problem, not yours. Has he been to a doctor? No. - Did you ask him to? - I did. And so?.. You'll see, when you're my age. I'll be long gone, but you'll understand. It's horrible to be alone when you're old. - You're not alone, Mother. - Am I not? You could sell everything and move here, with us. - Move where? - To Lithuania. To Lithuania? Now? Don't you hear the news? Can't you see what's going on in the world? Only a madman could move to Lithuania nowadays. You must leave this place as soon as possible. - Well, Feliksas is working on that. - On what? Has any of his plans ever come true? - Good morning. - Good morning. Good morning. The Manager is away. - What? - He left for Divinopolis. We agreed to meet here. Well, he didn't tell me anything. What happened? We lost Klaipėda. What? I phoned the Administration this morning to set up a meeting. They received an ultimatum from Germany yesterday. They didn't tell anyone about it. Accepted everything. This very morning Germans marched into the whole region. - And our army? - Withdrew. The Germans will let us use the port. That will be presented as a diplomatic victory. Then they'll dissolve the Government, appoint a new one. Same story as with Vilnius. Now we have neither capital nor the sea. I never saw it. - What? Klaipėda. You haven't been to Klaipėda? I've never been to the sea. A year ago, you'd be standing right there. Even the sea takes away 50 centimetres of our shore each year. - Is Klaipėda that way? - Yes. Kopgalis, the White Lighthouse. A little further - Bommelsvite. The Laukininkai Church. St. John's Church Tower. The Reformed Church. And the chimney of the cellulose factory. I can't see a thing. They are not visible. I just tell what I remember. - Is it nice? - Klaipėda? A fairy-tale. If I was given three wishes, it would be: Klaipėda. Victoria Hotel. Lunch and dinner at the Sanssouci. I was there with my wife once. I had to leave for an expedition. Veronika came to see me off. The sea got stormy and the ship couldn't enter the harbour, so... We had to wait. It was January. There's nothing to do in Klaipėda in January. You sleep till three, and then you sit at the Sanssouci. Coffee, brioche with jam... You listen to the sea wind scorching the forest. Lights go up in the harbour. And you just don't want to go anywhere anymore. Me, my wife and daughter, we nearly went to the sea twice. Why didn't you? The President did. What about you? Someone had to stay in Kaunas. You could be the President. - Who, me? - Yes. - No. - Yes, you could. - Stop it. - Why not? I've never even steered a car. Wait here, I'll be right back. At ease. - Good day, gentlemen. - Good day. Please excuse my interrupting. It's fine. You, sir, are the former Prime Minister of Lithuania, Jonas Servus? Former... You were present at the Lithuanian Military Academy graduation, exactly one year ago, weren't you? - That's right. Allow me to introduce myself. Lieutenant Česnulevičius. My pleasure. I was one of those graduates, who received a sabre from the President. We listened to the President's speech, and all. About duty. Our regiment was deployed in Klaipėda. Today we were withdrawn. We simply gave up our barracks to the Germans. Washed them, cleaned them and all. Well, it's not that simple. What do you mean? Fight or flight. Sounds simple enough to me. I'm not sure you understand what war is, young man. Is that so? How about we step outside and you show it to me? You think our military is completely powerless? Perhaps you'd like to see what our military is capable of? - A petition? - No. - Public letter? - No. What if we just talk to him? No, it's not so easy to persuade him. And what if... If there was a public address? If I propose the Backup Lithuania on a special occasion, like, his 70th anniversary? Backup Lithuania, the Leader's gift to his Nation. He'd have no other choice. Everybody would know. Everybody would learn how doomed we are. Everybody knows that anyway. He doesn't think so. - Hi. - Hi. - We're having guests? - It's Antanas. Antanas who? Mother brought him, Feliksas. I don't know how she found him. I haven't seen him in ages. I went to the grocery shop with Julytė. We got home, opened the door and there was Mother with Antanas. She said she asked him to drive her around to see some land plots. I told her you could do it. Good evening. Good evening. Please, help yourselves. Go on, take it, please. Great sandwiches. You won't get them at home, I'm sure. Please. My wife made them. Veronika is an excellent cook. - I'm Feliksas Gruodis. - I know. I know you know. Please, Mother, have some. You must be hungry. All day on your feet. Veronika tells me you've been driving Mother to check out some land. Let me pay for your trouble. How much for a kilometre these days? How far have you gone today? - Stop this circus. What? I just want to thank the man for taking care of our Mother the way we're unable to. Excuse me. No, sit. I'll go. I'm all dressed up anyway. Veronika will show you around later on. This here is our largest room. The floor's newly waxed. Here's the dining room, but you know that. The flat is pretty big for the two of us. There's the bedroom, children's room. We have no children but now that Mother is here, this will get sorted soon. Have a good night. At 2AM, an armoured vehicle enters the yard of the Army Headquarters, followed by 2nd and 5th infantry regiments. At the same time, the MP school staff takes over Kaunas Commandant's Headquarters. The tanks are deployed by the train station, 3rd police station, Panemunė Bridge and the Railway Bridge. The Hussar regiment takes over the central telephone station and automated telephone station at the Ministry of Justice, Šančiai military central telephone station and the military HQ central telephone station. Once the telephone network is paralysed, we go to the President to announce his relief of the presidential duties. This is announced by the radiophone and The News Service at 7 o'clock AM. Then I deliver the speech on the radio. How long do I have to think it over? Until 10AM, tomorrow. Alright. Kazys? This might be our last chance. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. It's almost finished, I'll bring some more. Thank you. I'll be back in a minute. We are too small and too weak to alone navigate the tumultuous vertigo that is likely to rise very soon. Therefore, I want to express my deepest gratitude on this historical day for Lithuania, that today, amidst the wars and calamities, our historical capital Vilnius and its Region has been returned to us. With this we also receive a common border with the comradely Soviet Russia. Our relationship with our great neighbour has always been friendly, because the neighbourly bond is keeping us as close as ever. What do you think? About what? Is this decent enough? It is. You see, I don't want to mention... It's uncomfortable to mention that we're letting in their army. Everyone's so happy about Vilnius. I hate to spoil the mood. There's a large crowd at the Presidential Palace. By the Train Station as well. They would have carried you on their hands. That's why we came to meet you here. How were things over there? Where? In Moscow. They're doing everything at night. All the sessions in those three days took place at night. The tone was always raised. Whenever I tried to speak, I was interrupted. We signed it at 1 AM, then we had a party: vodka, some sort of meat, salad... The photographers came over to take pictures. They were also given vodka. They even bowed for that. I never saw anyone bowing so much in front of the... By 3am it was over. I thought we were gonna go to the Embassy to sleep. But they brought us to some church back in the Kremlin. It had a screen put up instead of an altar, and a table of desserts. Everyone was given champagne. And then they showed films until 7 in the morning. Starting with some gymnastics parade, then a fiction film... There we were, sitting with champagne. And they were behind us. They weren't looking at the screen but checking if we were watching it. The tension was exhausting, I could barely stay awake. How many troops are we letting in? They agreed on 50 thousand with the Germans. "Let in"... I said, but that's occupation. They just smiled back. "That's what the Estonians said." We barely managed to negotiate it down to 20 thousand. But then they brought a document where the number had been increased again by hand. And what did you do? We asked them to rewrite it. Latvians will have to let 25,000 in. But that's the size of their army. Exactly. This is absurd. Total disregard. If they try anything funny here, we'll chase them out like we mean it. Without a doubt.
