The police haven't found it and don't know its destination... However, we now know that the hijacker is a young man... Bruno Fournier, who is only 22. The police have questionned his mother and brother They suggested that Bruno plans to join his girlfriend... ..who remains unknown. Hijacking a bus for love seems crazy but Bruno... ..isnt a delinquent according to his relatives. They say he's withdrawn and incapable of such an act. Another conflict in French politics... Police ahead ! Turn down there. The bus won't make it. Just fucking do it. It's not a 4WD. Jesus, don't push me ! We're stopping here. We'll sleep here. Here ?! We can't sleep here, Miss ! -Are they scared ? -What do you think ? The lighting'll hit us ! Calm down. There's nothing to be scared of. Look, am I scared ? You're big now. It's just a storm. It won't last. We'll burn under the trees ! Listen. Do you know the story of the stinking Martian ? Well, I tell you then. It's a true story Martians don't exist ! No way. you're wrong, there's loads of them. There's one up the front there. Well, this Martian lost an eye inthe war with the \enutians. They took him prisoner and tortured him to find his friends... But he didn't tell. He was really brave. So, the Venutians called a torture expert... who had a head like a tyre with a hole in it. He tore his eye out with his fingers... really slowly The Martian didn't talk. So, they took him to the woods to kill him... But he smashed them up and got away He was tough. They chased him but he hid in a swamp. The Black Swamp. Afilthy, nasty, slimy swamp. He caught something there and his skin became sticky like tape. Everything he touched stuck to him forever How did he managed to eat ? With a straw. He washed with a hoover ‘cos soap stuck to his hand... ..until it just rotted away Didn't the straw stick to him ? No, he wore gloves. Didn't they stick ? No, they didn't. Why ? They were biodegradable gloves that lasted a few minutes. Yeah, biodegradable gloves. As he couldn't touch things he was sad. So he came down to Earth. But those dumb scientists got it all wrong. They sent him to land in ahospital waste-bin... ..full of scabby bandages, bloody sheets... ..jars of eyes and buckets of sick... rotting organs and all sorts... When he got out, even his mother wouldn't have known him. And he stank like Hell. That's how he became the stinking Martian. When Armstrong woke from hibernation, he opened the glass lid... ...and pressed the computer keys... to wake his colleagues. When the lids opened, he smelled this stifling stench. He tumed round... and saw the stinking Martian in one of the pods. He was a stoweaway on the shuttle. Get some sleep. We've along way to go... I'm not tired. Why are you against me ? Don't count on me to fall asleep first, wiseguy ! Hey, asshole... Sleep back there and leave me the keys. 1 told you we'd make it, you old grouch. Right, I have to take two kids. Who should I take today ? Want to come ? Hey, that's cool, that's really cool ! Can I come too ? Sure you can come ! Your kids are fucking cool, Miss ! Thank the stinking Martian for that. Yeah, he's a good one. Don't try anything. Any bullshit and I'l plug one. The keys. Could I speak to Juliette Mangin, please ? - Who's calling ? - Afriend Afriend...I'll call het Hi, it's Bruno.

What if they fight back ? Don't worry about that. Will you fire ? No, I just scared them. It's something else, huh ? All these kids are coming to see you too now I'd have liked you to come by train. Don't you like being on radio ? No one knows it's us. Ever had a secret like that before ? - Dyour friends know ? - The cows... They'll die of jealousy.
