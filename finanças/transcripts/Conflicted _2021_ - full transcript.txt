And when he find out that bitch ass nigga raped you, he gonn' flip the fuck out. - You think so? - Yo, I know so. - You know what, shit. Valentine was the one that was telling me that Hunter was cheating and shit with the bitches in the first place. - See, perfect. Use all that against his ass. - You know what, you're right. And then maybe Hunter will understand the position that that nigga, Valentine put me in in the first place. I really didn't think about it like that. - What did I do now. - You didn't do anything. - So what we need to talk about? - Baby, we need to talk about us, the plans for our relationship. I can't just sit and wait on you to get your life together, baby. - Hey, we already talked about this. Ain't nothing to mention them all right now. So don't do that. - Well, that's not working for me. I need stability and you all over the place. - What do you want me to do? - I want you to make a choice. - Between what? - Oh, I need to spell it out for you. - Babe, I've been in the streets working my ass off trying to get my life back together and you already know what I've been going through. Everything that happened to Nick. - I don't wanna hear you say anything about what happened with Nick. You wanna keep using that shit as an excuse to go back out into these streets with this stupid shit. Instead of standing up and being a man, you being a coward. - Coward. - Yes, a coward. - I ain't no motherfucking coward. - You are a fucking coward. You care so much about what everybody else think. These streets don't give a fuck about you. - The streets, the people, the hustle is just who I am, baby. - So what about me, what about us? - What do you want me to do? - I can't do this. - You can't do what? - I can't do this. - You can't do what? - I'm pregnant, Hunter. I'm pregnant. Yeah, with your baby. And I'll be damned if I have a child without a father. You're not doing this to me. - You sure? - I'm positive. That's why you need to get your shit together. Do you understand what I'm saying to you? I'm not playing, babe. - Come here, come here. - You can't do this to me. You can't do this to me. - Hold on, let me call you back. Hey yo, so what's up. What's the fucking plan? - Man, that that bitch ass nigga, Valentine. Man, this raped my girl. Your girl, who? - Brianna. - What you mean he raped her. I thought they was fucking around or something. - I mean, yeah they was. But this nigga, this nigga get caught in his feelings 'cause he saw her talking to her ex at the bar, which happened to be his right-hand man, Hunter. - That was his man's girl.

Make sure you shoot me that fucking text. - Got you. - Have a seat. - Nice little spot here. - Thank you, thank you. - Look like life be treating you pretty good. - No, I'm trying, I'm trying. You want something to drink? - I'll do a shot with you. - Okay. - So what's up, what you wanna talk about? - Well, like I never stopped loving you. Like first of all, let me just say that, okay. But after you got locked up and went away, I felt confused and lonely. - Bree, we already traveled this road. We ain't gotta even go there again. We good. - I know, but I feel like I need to tell you the reason why I did what I did. - Okay. - But I need you to promise me that you're not gon to flip out and act crazy. - Say what you got to say, Bree. - Okay. Well, when you first got locked up and went away, your man Valentine, he would, you know, he would come by, give me money, make sure I was okay. - Okay, that's what he's supposed to do. - I know, right. But he started to come over maybe a little bit more than he should have. - What do you mean more than he should have? - Well, he would pop up late night unannounced, telling me how beautiful I was, how I deserved better. And at first I won't entertain it, but he started to tell me about all the bitches that you was fucking with. And at that point I felt lonely and betrayed and shit, I thought he was just trying to help me. - So if you're tryina tell me that you and V was out here around while I was locked up. - Listen, Hunter, listen. I know that this sound... - Yo, you this nigga while I'm fighting for my freedom. Is that what you're trying to tell me? - Listen Hunter, I'm so sorry. - Sorry, bitch, I should kick your motherfucking ass. Everything I did for you, I sacrificed for you. - It wasn't about you, what about me? - What about you? You left me out here. - Yo, that nigga raped me, Hunter. - No, no, don't even sound right. - He raped me, Hunter. - That don't even sound right. V wouldn't do that. - Yo, he raped me, he came to my house. He know I still love you. Yo, he is jealous of you and he always has been. - If I find like you fucking with me, you lying. - Yo, why would I lie? Why the fuck would I lie? - This would get real fucking ugly man.
