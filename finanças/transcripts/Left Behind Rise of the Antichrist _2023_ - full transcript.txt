"With God, all things are possible." Matthew 19:26 Over the years, I've shared that verse more times than I could ever count. But now for the first time, I know it's true. You see, six months ago, something impossible did happen down there. One instant of time, millions of people just disappeared without a trace. Poof, gone, just like that. Well, if that's not impossible, then I don't know what is. Its cleanup efforts continue in the aftermath of the vanishings. Single most catastrophic event in all of human history. And security forces work to stem worldwide violence. There's still more questions than answers. Today, people still say the vanishings came without a warning or any kind of explanation. But that's just not true. There were plenty of warnings and explanations. But there were also plenty of closed minds. While the President insists that the greatest threat to our country is those clinging to the conspiracy theory that somehow God had something to do with the vanishings. And we all know that a closed mind is not an easy thing to pry open. But even after watching all those people just vanished into thin air, most people still had no interest in the fact that all of it was written down thousands of years ago in that dusty old book on the shelf. It's been six months since tens of millions of people suddenly disappeared. And as far as we're concerned, none of them had been seen since. So, they hid from the truth mostly, dreaming up any answer they could think of, as long as it didn't involve God, of course. Solar flares, secret weapons, Little Green Men. Nothing was too crazy for a world determined not to see the truth. And, of course, one thing you can always count on when disaster strikes. There are those whose first thought is how to seize the opportunity. For Jonathan Stonagal, while he seemed to have his plan in place before those empty clothes that even hit the ground. Now you understand, Mr. Stonagal, if it were up to me, I wouldn't be questioning any of this. It is up to UN, all of it. The board can't interfere with what I'm doing without unanimous consent. You're not here to tell me that you're turning your back on me now. Are you, Ed? I've turned hundreds into thousands, thousands into millions, millions into billions. And still, the bean counters think that they know what's best. We're losing millions of dollars everyday now with all of your new projects and investments. And even the biggest social media platform in history buying up every media company you can get your hands on. You don't need to be the only source of news and information. And now, $400 million to build a temple in the Middle East? It's a nice temple. Sir, your two o'clock is here. I suggest you go and give serious thought as to what side of the table you wanna be sitting on. Something big is coming. Trust me. You wanna make sure you're on the right team. Does people grapple with a new reality Trying to accept the fact that they may never see those missing loved ones again. Faith in our leaders is gone. And frustration and anger is in an all-time high. Not only have violent crimes risen dramatically, but suicides are soaring out of control. But according to mental health experts, there is an explanation to what's going on. We're going to get into that with one of them right after the break. Tonight on GWN... I have to admit, I was never a big fan of Rayford Steele. His wife, Irene, had tried for years to get him to join us at New Hope. But I guess church just wasn't his thing. When she did manage to drag him there, he'd either read the sports news on his phone or grab a quick nap thinking everyone would believe he's praying. Irene had warned him about the Rapture over and over again. Or at least that's how it seemed to him. - I just can't control. - This is Pampam 257. We have an emergency. I repeat, we have an emergency. JFK Control, listen to me. We've lost passengers. People have literally disappeared from the plane at 30,000 feet. So, when half the passengers on his transatlantic flight vanished that night, he knew right away what had happened. He may not have fully understood what it meant, but Irene had told him what would happen. And it did. And so, at least Ray knew one thing for sure. He desperately wanted to believe that Irene was right. I miss you and Rayme so much. It's been hard. I just keep thinking about the things I said and did. Well, you know much I love you. I just wish I could see you one more time. But I know I can't. Yeah, I know I can't. The world's obsession with the vanishings is still in full force. And since we have no answers from our supposed leaders, that's not really a surprise. And while the immediate panic and acute terror may have passed, I don't think anyone can say that the world is not a completely different place now. In the past six months, we've seen a dramatic, even shocking increase in virtually every metric of human depravity. Compared to the same time last year? Murders are up by more than 300%, and suicides are up nearly 1,000%. The violent crime, assault, rape, robbery, vandalism, looting, rioting, they're all shattering records. And mental health experts are telling us that the worst is yet to come. I have with me tonight, Dr. Ruby Kincaid, who is leading the multinational investigation into what many are now calling, "a pandemic of evil." Doctor, thank you so much for being here with us tonight. So, I guess we should just get right to the heart of the matter. What's going on? In the case of the vanishings, there's simply no historical knowledge to draw on. So, people are triggered into a prolonged fight or flight reaction. Uh, there is anger, fear, mistrust, retaliation. Those are powerful emotions, and they need an outlet. So, do you think world leaders and our own government as well should be doing a better job at helping us understand exactly what's happening? I mean, I know we have no idea where those people went, but telling everyone to stay at home, stop asking so many questions. I mean, that can't likely be helping. Uh, I think the root cause is not the lack of clear information, but the abundance of misinformation. Our leaders need to do more to stop people from coming up with conspiracy theories. So, ignorance is bliss? Uh, protecting people from dangerous ideas isn't making them ignorant. We need to make it our priority to keep people safe. Keep them safe from what exactly? Another wave of vanishings. What? Hold on. A second wave of vanishings? Well, we have been feeding all of the data we've managed to gather about the vanishings into a database. We were then able to use sophisticated computer algorithms to create predictive models. And those models suggest that a second wave is not only possible, it's almost certain. So, computers figured this out. That's right. Do you yourself, personally, believe more people are gonna disappear? Or do you think that people are just better off scared right now, you know, to keep them more compliant? I mean, we have a problem, where people are so terrified and confused that they're becoming violent and self-destructive. And you think coming on here and scaring them even more is gonna somehow make things better? Are you saying that you know for a fact that it's not going to happen again? Not at all. Not at all. I have no idea. And I'm starting to suspect that... But at least I'm not sitting here pretending like I do. I am talking about science here. And some of the world's top scientists have studied the data very carefully. -And it suggests-- -Where did it come from? -I'm sorry? -The data? Where did it come from? All of the data has been verified by the United Nations. It's all publicly available in the UN's Vanishing Accountability Project. I'm asking you, where did they get their information from? I just told you all of the data has-- - Cut it now. - Buck, wrap it up. I'm sorry, but I guess that is all the time we have for tonight. Thank you for coming on. But I do want to encourage our viewers, keep demanding facts. Don't just blindly accept whatever the so-called experts are telling us. And I wouldn't be too quick to sign up for a vanishing's vaccine either. I'm Cameron Williams. Up next is Victoria Jordan. We'll see you in a minute. And we are out. Who killed that? We were not out of time. Wow, Captain Steele. It's good to see you. - Ooh. - Hmm? Captain, you're aware that we do not encourage unkempt hair for our pilots. Are you not? Unkempt? I just showered last week. And these pants, those aren't standard issue, are they? Oh, and the next time we meet, I want to see a shine on those feet. I'll see what I can do. You look great, Dad. Hey, and look, look, at least it still fit. -Mm-hmm. -Yeah. So, are you thinking of getting into the pilot seat? Yeah. Well, I was thinking maybe I could do a couple of runs for FedEx, you know? So, I'm going to be gone for days on end. You know, I was hated being away so much, you know, from you and Rayme and mom so... -Plus, no passengers. -Yeah. Plus, no passengers. Okay, Captain. I'm hungry. Did you make me breakfast? - Did you make me breakfast? - Well, no. What do you mean? You're the one who's up before me. All right. - Where's Ivy? - I'm right here. I can't believe you changed the B-roll without asking me first. I didn't touch it after you proved it. I thought you're in the control room. I was. No one came in. -Connor. -Connor. Don't get Connor fired. He's just a kid. You think I'm mad at Connor? What is he going to do? Say no to Plank? -I would have. -Yeah. Well, I'm sure that's why he didn't ask you. Well, maybe it's because there's only one guy here that knows how to swap the footage in a live broadcast without setting for the control room. Did you really think I would change your B-roll in a live show without your approval? Of course not. Buck's relentless reporting brought GWN its highest ratings ever. But it seemed the closer he got to the truth, the more his own network pushed back. Mr. Williams, I am so sorry. Ivy had no idea that the B-roll was gonna be charged. Connor, it's fine. I'm sure you weren't really in a position to argue with Mr. Plank, right? Thank you for understanding, sir. -Plank. -Be gentle. You know me better than that. Okay, Steve, I know you have shareholders to appease, but I have a contract. -And a pretty good one at that. -And. And it means I don't have to give primetime exposure to crackpot conspiracy theorists like her. You're a reporter, Buck. Sometimes that means going outside of your comfort zone and interviewing people that you don't always agree with. I'm happy to talk to anybody with a news or the story. It was fearmongering, Plank. Plain and simple. Computers. Computers say more people are gonna vanish. Well, maybe she should spend her time trying to find people who already disappeared. Are you done? What was up with that B-roll horror show? Oh, I thought you'd be pleased. I had our editors and the new kid dig up something a little more sensational. Sensational? Plank, you showed a video of terrified and desperate people jumping off of buildings. It's not sensational. It's just sick. And using Connor? I mean, the kid has only been here a few months. You're already teaching him the art of fake news? Come on, wake up, Buck! Our military and our police were decimated with the vanishings. Scared people stay in their homes. They lock themselves inside. And that's what we need right now. Don't you think that locking people in their homes is gonna add to the problem? We grieve by sharing. We have a lot of people that need to deal with the fact that they lost everything that matters. Their wives-- -Yes, Erica. -Did you see the UN story? They're pushing for the Romanian president to be the new Secretary General. -Carpathia? -So? So, it's just strange he didn't even ask to be appointed. Did they overtake the UN by force? No, he hasn't even made a statement. Oh, then it's not news. So, please, go and find me some news. Buck, the last thing we need right now are the streets overrun with unstable and potentially violent people. So, until the authorities can get their arms, their fat arms around this thing it is our duty to do what we can. If you think that somehow it's your civic duty to terrify people, I can't stop you. But it's the last time you're gonna do it on my show. Oh, well, then maybe it's time to think about cancelling your show. Yeah, I think we both know that's not gonna happen. Try me. It seems that Chloe Steele spent most of her time haunted, tortured by the memory of her little brother, vanishing right from her arms as she hugged him. How could she have done things differently? How could she have saved him from whatever it was? She was terrified that he was lost forever. And that somehow, it was her fault. It's always been my position that we should take advantage of every crisis to make the world a better place. With each disaster, storm, or war, comes the opportunity for all of us to do better. As our climate gets hotter, as we become more interconnected, as pandemics race across the globe, something is coming. Some crisis will strike all of us. And we should welcome whatever it is with open arms. Because only then will the world finally come together and create a truly global union. A single world government founded on peace and unity. Buck, what's going on? Hey, remember that guy, Davos, last year talking about opportunity and catastrophe? Well, that was almost all of them. True. Well, this guy's name is Cothran. He owns Dominator Analytics. And I think he may be-- Whoa, whoa, whoa, let's not do this over the phone. Let's just say it's a rabbit hole. I do love a good rabbit. I'm on my way. Please. Pleas no. Please let me go. Please let me in. Let me... No. Let me in! Chloe, wake up. Hey, hey, wake up. Are you... are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine. That must have been quite a dream. It was just really real. You know, like, it was like a nightmare, but it's like I was losing him all over again. We all have different ways of dealing with things that we don't understand. But I think it's time to focus on the future. As hard as it is, we have to stop looking back. Well, then where am I supposed to look? Because back is where we lost them. I know. I know. You're not the only one who needs to find a new approach. We have both been hiding for too long. Mom and Rayme, they're counting on us to do the right thing. What do you mean they were counting on us? No. No. I mean, they are counting on us. And what makes you so sure? Because mom told us. Okay. What, because mom said so? That didn't even work when I was 12. Besides, mom's Rapture theories are already been proven wrong. So, do you think Mom was stupid or just gullible? What? I never said that. Then don't you think that we owe her the courtesy of considering the fact that she told us it was going to happen? Sure, it was easy to dismiss it before it happened. But doesn't it seem strange that it's still so easy to dismiss it now? Even though we saw it with our own eyes? Enter. Unless you're gonna at least try to stop acting like a crazy conspiracy theorist. Well, who are you calling a conspiracy theorist? Oh, so you're just admitting to being crazy? Yes. I'm quite comfortable with that. Shut the door. Here. So Cothran, and his Dominator Analytics provides virtually all the raw data, the UN compiled all of it; surveys, research studies, polls. These guys do it all. And they've got the market cornered. So, you're saying they can just stand up and tell the world anything they want? And they'd be able to back it up with fake stats? -Yep. -What about the vanishings? All those reports about the year's total mass not changing that day, statistics about how many people disappeared, who they were, how they might have been different from the rest of us. -Those? -Yep. All of it came through Dominator. Wow. Well, at least we know what Cothran's agenda is. He's at crisis to get us to accept changes that we wouldn't have otherwise. When you have complete control over the narrative like that guy does, I mean, you can turn anything -into a crisis. -That's all true. But Cothran is not the guy calling the shots. -He's just another suit. -So, who's calling the shots? These are interconnected corporations. Fifteen television networks, 120 individual stations, almost 300 newspapers. Remember newspapers? Let's see, two Hollywood Film Studios, 14 of the top 20 magazines. Believe it or not, the two biggest pharmaceutical companies in the world. That's why we got rich of COVID. Look, here's one you might find interesting. -He's your boss. -GWN? No, that's not right. GWN is owned by the Dornan family. Oh, and have you ever met the Dornans? No. That's because there is no Dornan family, never was. Jack Dornan never married. He didn't have a family. He's been dead for 30 years. All of these companies are run directly or indirectly by one man. Jonathan Stonagal. -What? The Eden guy? -One in the same. He's been pushing something called the Great Reset for years, a true New World Order globalist. I've been having a hard time getting his message out. I mean what? Even though it already has five billion users. -No, it's 6.5 now. -Sheesh. What's amazing is that he tripled his wealth during the COVID pandemic. And he tripled it again in the aftermath of the vanishings. Let's go. -So? Where were you? -Sorry? Where were you when it happened? Oh, I was in a plane halfway across the Atlantic. Ah, I was right. -About what? That you would have a cooler story than I do. Best and worst day of my life. Way out of your league. Never let a crisis go to waste. -Right? -Yeah. - Hi. - Hey. So tell me, that her boyfriend disappeared? What? How depraved do you think I am? No, he didn't disappear. He was hit by a driverless bus. Hang on a second. Come here. Hold this and keep an eye out. Oh, it's heavy. Made of lead? Not made of. No. But coated with. The Fed's devices that can download your entire hard drive from ten feet away. -Ever heard of a safe? -Yeah. It's in the office filing cabinet bolted to the floor. Let's go. You know, one day, I'm gonna stumble into the wrong minefield and the Feds are gonna clean up my office, including the safe. What are they gonna find? A hard drive full of encrypted files. And if they keep out long enough, they'll crack the encryption and get the grand prize. Which is what? Thirty seasons of the Simpsons. That's gonna tick them off. Or maybe not. It's Blu-ray. Nice. Chloe couldn't help but wonder if her dad was right. What if mom and Rayme were lost because of something in that book? All she could do was wish her mom had never opened that stupid Bible in the first place. ♪ ...Somehow I can hear you ♪ You will take away my mind Buck and Chloe met on the day of the Rapture. Buck had been a passenger on that flight piloted by Ray. Many romantics would say it was fate that brought Buck and Chloe together. -Autograph. -Oh. Hey. But I now know that there was a far greater force at work. They needed to be together. God had a plan. I know it's not just about Plank, though. It's the whole network, the whole business, really. I honestly don't wanna do it anymore. Are you kidding? You have the biggest audience in cable news. Yeah. Well, that would be a good thing if I didn't have to put air quotes from the word "news." Hey, look at these people, right? They know who you are. They trust you. They trust you even if they've never met you. See, that's the problem. They trust me to tell them the truth. But news is no longer about truth. It's about a message and facts. It don't even matter anymore. I go on that show every single night and lie to them as if we're too afraid they can't handle the truth. -Hi. -Hey. Yeah. Great. I used to love my job. I was an investigative journalist for ten years. You know what I did? I investigated things that needed to be investigated. And then I actually told people about what I found. Poof. -And now? -Now, I'm more like an actor. I do my lines. And depending on whatever story we decide to report, I try to convince the world that things are way, way better or far, far worse than they actually are. I just feel like my audience is smarter than that, you know? They're not a bunch of religious wackos who are only looking for easy answers and don't require facts or two seconds of their own thought. Wackos like my mom? Chloe, no, I'm-- I didn't mean that. I just--I'm trying to process-- - Are you seeing this? - What is it? No, I can't believe it. Second wave? Here we go. I think I need to get to the studio. -Are you okay? -Yeah. Okay. I'll call you later. Let's go. Although there are plenty of rumors and internet chatter, tracking down eyewitnesses has actually been harder than we expected. One notable witness was apparently Senator, Arthur Brandon. But while he has issued a statement, he has so far been unwilling to speak to the media. In fact, we've been having a hard time tracking down anyone who's actually witnessed the new vanishing. It's like, everybody knows there was a second wave, but nobody's actually seen it happen. So, Anna, while we wait for our coverage of the UN press conference, what do you think about all this? I believe him. He's a senator, and he's a good man. Why would one of our own government officials make something like that up? Just to scare us? It's ridiculous. Well, just like last time. I mean, there weren't any reports of unusual activity in the skies around the Earth's orbit. So, are you still sticking with the UFO theory? Of course. What else could have done something like this? Many of the scientists I spoke to Seem to think that this is not the first time these vanishings have happened on this planet. Certainly, the first time any of us noticed. We're talking millions of years ago, long before people were recording history. In fact, it's probably why there are gaping holes in the fossil record showing the totality of human evolution. Well, maybe the UFOs have been here many times. But then why has nobody seen them? You just said there was no one here to report the visits millions of years ago. Okay. Reverend Pinkus, what do you think? I mean, you originally stated that the vanishings were the Christian Rapture. -I mean, is that so right? -That's true. It was actually a bit scary. But so many Christians are still here, and including hundreds from my own church. There's no way that it could have been the Rapture. Now, that doesn't mean that God didn't have his hand in it, though. The Bible does teach that God will send a powerful delusion in the last days. And I personally believe that this whole vanishing thing is part of that. Well, let's all try our best not to add to those delusions. What about you, Buck? What do you think? Well, the way I see it, there's only one explanation that doesn't require an appeal to an imaginary power, or unseen force. It's simply a new technology. I mean, you think we'd stop being so surprised at what the human race is capable of creating at this point. We all watched people disappear on "Star Trek" growing up, communicators, translators, Androids, robots, they're all realities now. So, why not the transporter beam? So, you're saying this is a man-made weapon? I never said it was a weapon. I said technology. Arthur C. Clarke once said that any sufficiently advanced technology is indistinguishable from magic. What I'd take away from that is we don't need to look for magic just because we don't understand how something works. I just got report that we are about to begin our coverage of the UN press conference. Less than a year ago, if someone had told me that millions of people were just gonna disappear, I, like you, would have said they were crazy. Fast forward to today, and the unimaginable has become real. And with the news that the vanishings were not simply a one-time event, we should all be reminded that we have no choice but to face this unprecedented threat together. Not as individual nation states divided by rivers or mountains or thousands of years of war, but as one people united at last. Fellow citizens of the world, welcome to the future. Welcome to a new reality. A great reset, where we move from a tribal mentality to united and unstoppable force ready to face any challenge because there is no greater power in the universe than a unified human race. As you already know, the second wave of vanishings, even though the extent is not yet known, has thrown the financial markets back into chaos. And while the major stock exchanges quickly closed, the losses were already catastrophic from panic selling in every country in the world. The World Monetary Fund has also issued a formal warning that more than 100 countries will likely be bankrupt within 60 days. And within a year, more than 90% of the world's citizens will be living in poverty. Fortunately, we have a solution. And there it was, surreal moment to say the least. One of the most powerful men on the planet Standing in front of the world and promising a one world economy, a one world currency, and a path to peace and prosperity. Exactly the system the Bible told this was coming. And unsurprisingly, the people, and especially the news media, just gobbled it up. Today, under emergency conditions and with a nearly unanimous consent, the United Nations has voted to approve and mandate the electronic payment technology known as OTM. Created by Israeli Nobel Prize winner, Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig. Now, the reason I'm part of this announcement is that Eden, the largest social media platform ever, has agreed to make all our resources available to the UN free of charge in order to ensure that we can implement Eden Pay worldwide in a matter of weeks. Let me introduce the inventor on The Mark Digital Technologies, Dr. Chaim Rosenzweig. Buck, you'll be the first interview. Stand by. Ready studio in three, two, one. Dr. Rosenzweig, so good to see you again. Mr. Stonagal, thank you so much for taking the time to be with us tonight. Now, this is a lot bigger news than I think most people actually realize. I mean, Mr. Stonagal, you must have jumped through a lot of hoops to get this to where it is at the UN, correct? Well, there are some very smart people and extremely powerful positions around the world. And they see the need and wisely recognize Eden Pay as the best solution. Now, you said that you had essentially unanimous support from the UN membership. Can I assume that essentially unanimous is different from unanimous? Well, a few of the members have questions. And that's to be expected. Fortunately, none that we can't answer. Do you mind telling us who the holdouts are? All nations have formally agreed with two exceptions; Romania and Israel. Interesting. Dr. Rosenzweig, I'm a little confused by that. Why would Israel be holding out? I mean, isn't Eden built on Israeli technology? Israel has not signed the agreement yet because there are deal terms to be negotiated. Are those financial terms? Oh, no, no, nothing of that sort. There are other issues involved, including ongoing peace talks. We want to ensure that Eden ushers in an era of peace for Israel, and indeed for the entire world. So, we actually have peace in the Middle East as a dealter. Wow. No. No. No way. Could you just get the victim to come on camera and-- No. All right, then we'll go with the fake Jesus guy and make sure you get him on camera taking credit for the new vanishings. Look, I got to go. I've got to walk the dog. What's it to you? Goodbye. Tough day at the ministry of truth? Can't you tell that I'm not in the mood? I hate to be the one to break it to you, Steve, but you always look like that. So... ...to recap, two days, after I have a guest come on my show and predict a second wave of vanishings, we have a second wave of vanishings. It wasn't a prediction. She was simply reporting what the model said. Computer spit out data, people make predictions. Anyways, long story short, I decided to look into her claims a little more carefully, like I would have done before the show had I actually known that you were gonna have her on. But thank you for that, by the way. She's an interesting lady. I'll give you that. She works closely with a man named Joshua Todd-Cothran, who have actually heard give his message on how he wants to introduce a new world order. These people are obsessed with the idea of having a one world government that somehow will solve all poverty and wars. How dare they? Road to hell is paved with good intentions, Steve. So, their plan for several years now has been to create an infrastructure for global order by it, and this is the important part, by waiting for a global catastrophe. And then they're gonna use all the fear and uncertainty in the world to get people to accept changes they never would have accepted before the crisis. There is nothing new there. And it certainly isn't news. Well, I'm not finished yet, either. And then I have Dr. Kincaid come on my show and said she has computer models that are pointing towards a second wave of vanishing. So, she was right. I guess you owe her an apology. Yeah. You think so. Except, I'm not entirely convinced anyone vanishes this time around. You see I was able to find the source of the data that was used to make that prediction. Ninety percent of it came from one firm, Dominator Analytics, owned by Joshua Todd-Cothran. So, we have a guy who thinks we need to scare the hell out of people now scaring the hell out of people. Buck, you don't have facts. You're spitballing. He's not alone. He's got a partner. Jonathan Stonagal. Yeah. So, these guys whose fundamental mandate is to terrify people not only announce a second wave in advance and then use their own stats to back it up, but are now telling us that they're gonna take over the World Bank. And we don't have a choice, except to just go with it. Bottom line. I think these new vanishing counts That we so proudly display on all the screens during every broadcast are probably fake. -Is that it? -No, definitely not. I haven't even started digging yet. You're not going to. Buck, I know. You've got your beloved fan base. Yeah, you give them something to chew on. But you say it every day of the week. We are not in the conspiracy business. Okay, Plank, this isn't a conspiracy. This is the biggest news story since the vanishings themselves. No, no, that is not the big news story. The big news story is that the world is suffering and we are teetering on the brink of mass insanity. You start questioning the facts, the only facts, the few facts that we actually have, and you just make everything worse. Okay Plank, listen to me. No, you know what, you listen to me. You drag this line of nonsense into the public eye. You and I, we're both finished in the news business forever. I don't wanna hear another word on this. You don't share any of it with the staff. This conversation is over. Are we clear? You're wrong about this one. Are we clear? Oh, finally. Oh, come on. This is crazy. I'm glad Ray didn't find what he was looking for on Irene's phone. God's hand was on him, and he ended up right where he needed to be. Jesus told us in the last days, the world would hate Christians. The first rocks through the window at New Hope came only about an hour after the Rapture. So, why do people who don't even believe in God suddenly hate him so much? Because they have no one else to blame it on. Hello? Sometimes the hate exploded into violence. And you know what? Maybe I deserved it. If Ray hadn't shown up that day, who knows if I would have found my way? Pastor Barnes? I may have given up on God, but I'm humbled to know that God hadn't given up on me. How is it going, Ray? -No! No! No! -Let go! But even in total darkness, God can find a way to light the path, even with the faintest glint. It's the only thing I could find. Thanks. -What happened here? -A bunch of hooligans. Who can blame them? They're scared. -So, are you okay? -Yes, just my jaw. Yeah. So, what do I owe this pleasure? It's not like you've ever been a big fan of this place. Shouldn't I be the one who's surprised -to see you here? -I supposed so. What is it, Ray? Was it the Rapture? Yes. Yes, it was. Are you sure? I mean, are you really sure? You know what finally convinced me? When I saw it happen. -So, Irene and Rayme? -They're fine, Ray. They're in heaven for eternity. -But then... -Go ahead, Ray. You can ask. Why are you still here? Because I asked God to leave me behind. I'm not done living my life down here. So, I didn't want to leave too soon. Is that good enough for you? It would be if it were true. -Chloe. -Hi, Dr. White. - Hi. - I just-- What? Oh my. Oh! Goodness, what happened to you? -Come inside. -Thank you. Come on upstairs. Well, this looks pretty angry. But it's fairly shallow. No stitches required. I'll just give it a good rinse and apply some topical antibiotic, which should also help with the pain. -Thanks, Dr. White. -Aw. Amanda. Oh. Hi, Fern. Chloe, this is Fern. Fern, this is Irene's daughter. Mmm. Honey, I'm on borrowed time. So, I'm just gonna say it. You messed up big. Ray wanted to talk about prophecy. And who could blame him? His wife told him the Rapture was going to happen. And it did. So, of course, he was curious. Me, on the other hand, I guess I was just still pouting and feeling sorry for myself. But Ray managed to drag me into his little Bible study with what he would later admit was an intentional mistake. -Seven. -Huh? It's not six years, it's seven. Oh. Tribulation doesn't start when the Rapture happens. The seven-year clock doesn't start counting down till there's a signing of a seven-year peace agreement between Israel and their enemies. And you know what else you find out on that day? What? Who the Antichrist is. He's the one that confirms the treaty. Until then, his identity is anybody's guess. So then, who is this Antichrist? I mean, is it Satan? Not exactly. The Antichrist is Satan's counterfeit, Jesus. He was sent here to lie and deceive. He'd say one thing and then he'll-- you know what, forget it. I can't do this. What do you mean? Who am I to tell you what to believe? You know this stuff. I never believed it. None of it. I talked about God all the time. I guess I was just one of those false teachers that the Bible says who show up in the last days. We both made mistakes. So, how about we unmake them? All right. Look, I think we both believe this now. We missed our chance. But so did everyone else who's still here. They need to know the truth. Look around, no one comes here. No one's been here in months. They don't want the truth. One of them might. That should be enough. You're right. Start with this. Hello. My name is Vernon Billings, and I'm the lead pastor at the New Hope Church. I'm recording this as a message for all those left behind after the return of Christ in the air to call his church home in the Rapture. For all of you who lost loved ones, among the millions that vanished, please, be assured, they are fine. You have my word on that. Are you trying to scare me? -Perhaps, Chloe-- -Perhaps, Chloe, what? Needs everything sugar-coated for her? I think that's what got her here in the first place. - I'm sorry? - You should be. Don't you act all tough with me, Chloe Steele. I had a mama who worshipped to drink and throw me out on the street at 12. - Okay, what exactly did I do? - Do? Oh, I'm so glad you asked that question. Your mom was a friend of mine. And she made it her mission to ensure that we all know the answer to the question that everybody is asking now. I just never thought I would see the daughter of Irene Steele left behind. I see. So, if you both listened to my mom, then why are you still here? Oh, child. You in it now. The Apostle Paul wrote to the church at Corinth, "Behold, I tell you a mystery. We shall not all sleep, but shall be changed in a moment in the twinkling of an eye." Unfortunately, if you are watching this after the Rapture, then you are either in or soon to be in. A seven-year period of darkness, tribulation, And terror like the world has never seen. Please, I beg you, abandon your self-centered ideals. No matter what you have to face on Earth, it's not too late. You can still spend eternity in heaven. Turn to the Bible. Turn to God, not because you have no other choice, but because this is the right choice. Turn to God. I beg you. Take this opportunity and embrace these words. Get on your knees and thank God for this second chance. Ray knew that studying Bible prophecy was not enough. Heck, I was living proof of that. I knew that stuff inside out. I could have written a book about the Rapture. And yet, there I was. The gift of salvation is free. You can't earn it. You can't deserve it. You just have to ask and receive. I'd have laughed if you told me that one day Rayford Steele would be leading me to the altar. Thank you, Jesus. I want you to repeat these words, and to think about each word as you say it. Lord Jesus, I know I am a sinner. Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner. But I also know that you have offered me the gift of your forgiveness. But I also know that you have offered me the gift of your forgiveness. You gave your life for me, and then rose from the dead on the third day. You gave your life for me, and then rose from the dead on the third day. I gratefully accept your offer of salvation. I gratefully accept your offer of salvation. Please, Lord, come into my heart as my Lord and Savior. Please, Lord, come into my heart as my Lord and Savior. Thank you, Jesus. Amen. Amen. Well, what about the main server? -Any luck? - No way. Not without password. Well, we'll keep trying anyway. Come on, come on, come on. Aha. Shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot, shoot. Hey, Chloe, where are you? I didn't even know your mother's place is still running. Oh, no, no, I'm fine. I'm fine. I just wanted to do a talk about something. I know you might not be ready for this. But I saw something today. And I really want you to see it too. Well, what if it is about God? I mean, what does-- Chloe, please. Okay, yeah, fine. I'll call you tomorrow. Yeah, I love you too. Don't you think your dad would wanna know you got hurt? I need a doctor. Not a priest. Girl, you need to honor thy Father. And what is this? What do you want? Yes. -Hi, Ray. -Hattie. How are you? I'm good. So, please-- I'm sorry, why don't you come on in inside? I'm so glad to see that you're all right. Oh, yeah. I mean, I'm better than all right. - It's been good. - Yeah. Oh. I just really wanted to see you. You know, I've been thinking so much about you and I've been thinking about us. Yeah. You know, I meant to call but-- It's okay. You don't owe me an apology. Can I get you a drink, or something? I would love one. Thanks. -What can I get you? -Whatever you have. I left the airline. Really? To do what? I got a job at the UN. I'm gonna be working with the Romanian Ambassador, Nicolae Carpathia. Wow. That sounds great. I mean, it could be great for both of us. You know, the UN is having trouble getting negotiators and diplomatic teams out fast enough, and they're short on pilots. Oh, I'm not looking for a job. -But thanks. -Seriously? I mean, they're paying so well. You'll help the world get back on its feet. Not to mention you'll have an amazing co-worker with a lot of benefits. Hattie... I can't. I've got to stop living in the past, Ray. You have to stop worrying about the vanishings Those weren't vanishings. It was a Rapture just like I told you. The plane the night that it happened. It wasn't the Rapture. The Rapture was debunked on the first day. And there's been more vanishing since then. Do you know anyone who's gone in the second wave? Not personally. It's because the Raptures weren't debunked. And someone on TV told you that they were debunked and you just accepted it. What almost happened between us, it doesn't-- it doesn't matter now. Well, did I ever matter? Okay, that's not what I meant. Hattie, I've accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior. And just trust me on this. You cannot find the truth without him. You know? I really should have suspected that you take the coward's way out. You know you didn't feel guilty when your wife was here. But now, you feel guilty that she's gone? And so, you're running to God for forgiveness? I mean, who cares who you hurt along the way, right? If I hurt you? And I'm sorry, I really am. But accepting Christ is not cowardly. It's far from it. What was cowardly was being too afraid of the truth to even want to hear it. -Hattie... -No. Goodbye, Ray. Hey. I got in. Seriously? Yeah, and it's insane. I mean, it's gonna take some time. But this thing is huge. I mean, the biggest single program I've ever seen maybe 100 million lines of code. So, what are you saying? I'm saying that this is more than some kind of electronic pay app. How'd you get in? Let's just say someone on the inside thinks the world needs to see this. And so do you. Well, Megan, as you can see, this place is going absolutely crazy as we anticipate the arrival of the United Nations peace phenom, Nikolai Carpathia. This is the kind of reception you might have expected for a movie star. But for a politician, I haven't seen anything like this since Obama. I mean, listen to that crowd. After all the incredible work he did in Romania after the vanishings, the world is looking for someone they can trust to get us all back on track. And I'm not sure there's been a world leader who has earned that trust more than this man. Nicolae! Nicolae! Nicolae! Anyone see you come in? I took the stairs. What did you find? I got a look inside the Eden Pay platform. And it's a whole lot more than a glorified bank card. In fact, the whole financial part is maybe ten percent. -What's the rest of it? -A combination of things. Surveillance, tracking, biometric reporting, social credit. I mean, they may be planning to start with the money. But whoever has control over this system has control over the whole world and everyone in it. When you said social credit, which means they're gonna force you to either conform or be kicked out of the system. Yeah. And if you lose access to Eden Pay, then you can't even buy food. They're gonna pretend like it's not mandatory. Act like we actually have a choice to download the app, or starve to death. Pretty powerful marketing campaign. Yeah. My guy on the inside, says he is the smoking gun that connects all this and a whole lot more directly to Stonagal. And he's willing to hand it over. Do you trust him? He says I have to agree to make the whole thing public. He even wants to do a media interview to document the evidence. So, it seems like he's on our team. He's our only lead. I say we go for it. I don't think you should go. Think about it. If this is the FBI or CIA, or whatever, If this is a setup for my hacking, then they've got both of us and the story dies right there. Let me go. I'll bring a camera man. We'll tape the interview and then you run it. What if you'd get arrested? Well, then you still have all this. Hopefully, there'll still be enough to blow the lid off to Eden hoax. Okay. Yeah, let's do it. Where is he? Closed-door meeting since I got in. I haven't heard him yell once. Something is up. Got the images with the one where I'm interviewing Carpathia. It's going global. I swear she's trying to take my job. Yeah, obviously. Okay. So, I found a treasure trove of evidence to bury this guy. And I mean, I'm talking atomic level bombshells here. Whoa. Gimme, gimme, gimme. Have Sam run and search through the archives, anything related to Dominator Analytics have a start back about two years or so. And then take a look at those file, and you see what I'm talking about. I'm on it. We have a couple over times... Okay. ...the world of nations and states. The divided world. But in the heart of it all, we're still the world. One world, one people, one future. That's not just a hopeful mantra. That is the only way forward. And the only way to ensure the survival, not only of our species, but of this incredible planet that grew and evolved against incredible odds in this marvelous place that we call home. Progress is not something that happens gradually. It becomes invisible starts, sometimes for the better, sometimes for the worse. So, it is absolutely critical that we utilize the opportunities that existential crisis offers. It's Erica Miller. Get me someone from Dominator Analytics. ...word crisis is represented by two characters taken separately. Those two characters mean danger and opportunity. I don't think I could be more clear, Buck. I said I was speculating. So, I brought you back proof this time. And this? This isn't proof. Well, there's a lot more. -Where? -It's coming. -And your source? -You know I can't do that. But I know him and I trust him. Oh, but you don't trust me. I know who it is. It's that crazy professor, huh, who thinks that 9/11 was a false flag operation? You know what, it's your choice, Steve. But I'm greenlighting this story with or without you. It's not that simple. This isn't just about me. So, then call corporate. Talk to the VP of censorship. See what they say. Let's see if they really care about the narrative. Or if they care more about having the biggest cable audience on news TV. It's what you said the numbers, right? I mean, ratings, advertisers. Come on, man. Hey, Dad. Hey, Chloe, are you still at the hospice? Yeah. I need you to come see me. There's something I want to show you. I can't come home right now, Dad. No, I'm not at home. I'm at New Hope. You're at the church right now. Why? Yeah. Well, I found something. It's the answers. Pastor Barnes is here. Well, maybe that should tell you something if the pastor is still here. No, no, it's not what you think. Look, if you could just give him a chance and he-- Look, I'm kind of tied up here right now. And I'm really not in the mood for church. So, I'll talk to you later. Say hi to Pastor Barnes from me. Yeah, but-- Amanda, get my chair and pull the band around. There's an emergency. Fern? What is it? What? I wanna be baptized at your church. I heard rumors Pastor Barnes is available. All right. All right. Okay. You know what, if you're too scared to find out what's actually going on, then I'll just do it without your help. No, you won't. What do you mean, "No, I won't"? What I mean is, you will not pursue it. Period. As in you're done. Your show has been cancelled effective immediately. Are you seriously threatening to cancel the number one rated news show at GWN because I want to cover a story. It's not a threat. It's already done. And believe me, like I said, this is way beyond me. This is corporate. We have had a surge of complaints about your divisiveness. Divisiveness? You've become a symbol of mistrust, of division for the people. And it's one conspiracy after the other. Conspiracy, conspiracy. Your buyout is being papered. It'll be delivered to you tomorrow. In the meantime, I suggest that you go home and get some rest. And these fine gentlemen will show you out. Oh. Hey, Ray. These flyers are great. There's boxes of them back there. Pastor Billings had those printed a while ago. -I had nothing to do with that. -Yeah. But it explained everything that's going on in the world right now. We should be handing these out to everyone. No, no. Then we'll do a service. No to a service. Yeah. You and I know what's going on, what's really going on here. We can't just sit here and do nothing. -Hi, Dad. -Hey, Chloe. It's good to see you. -Pastor Bruce Barnes? -Yes, I'm Bruce. Well, I hope you don't mind, Pastor. But we have some questions for you. Well, come on in. I hope I have some answers. I may have something. There are three dates and times in this line of code. Okay. The first is the day everyone vanished. The second is yesterday, the date of the new vanishing. And the third is two days from now. -So, what does that mean? -I don't know. But the code itself was written three days before the new vanishings. So, they knew beforehand. How's that... how's that even possible? Well, I don't know. Either they knew something that the rest of us didn't, or they were involved in the vanishings. Here's a third option. What if the new vanishings never happened? The numbers are pretty high for it to be rumors. No. I know it sounds crazy, but I don't know anybody who knows anybody who disappeared. Do you? Yeah, sure. It's all over the news. But it's always somewhere else. Let's try something more, right? -Go back into the Eden system. -Mm-hmm. Type these three names. Michael Parker, Josh Walker, and Aaron Hewitt. So, who are these? Uh, they disappeared in the second vanishing. Okay. There are several documents with all three names in them. This is an email that was part of an internal memo sent in the IT department. Wait, this memo was sent before the second vanishings were reported? Over a week ago. That's it. That's our answer. It was faked. My guess is these people never even existed. We need to see your guy, and I'm coming with you. This might be my last chance to talk to him before word gets out and I lost my show. Wait, you lost your show? My guy should be here. Connor. Thanks for doing this, man. Yeah, thanks for thinking of me. Of course. Hey, look, I want to make sure that we do a real-time upload of the interview to the cloud. Make sure we don't lose anything, okay? Okay. Dirk, Connor. Connor, Dirk. - Hi. - Hey, Connor. Nice to meet you, yeah. You have everything you need? Yeah, let me just double-check this box, make sure I have the right cable. I have eyes on the vehicle. Both targets confirmed. Yes, sir. We have a couple more bags. Would you mind putting the seats down? -You got it. -Thanks. -So, you're through? -Yeah. It's a bomb! Run! Run! No! What about all the evidence debunking the Rapture theory? Lots of Christians still here. Lots of non-Christians gone. And don't forget this, this didn't happen in the twinkling of an eye. In fact, it's still happening now. -They're lying. -Who's lying? Anyone who tells you this wasn't in the Rapture. That's who. When the disciples asked Jesus on the Mount of Olives what life would be like in the last days, his first words were, "Take heed that no man deceive you." So, how do we know who we can trust? Trust God. Trust Jesus. Trust the Bible. And for literally, everyone else, take what they're saying to you and weighed against the word. And then you pray, pray, pray for God's help not to be led astray. So, if this is the Rapture, then what happens to the rest of us who didn't make the cut? Well, hopefully, we survive tribulation. That's what the Rapture was all about. Jesus taken his church to heaven to protect them from what is to come. And what is that exactly? Well, we don't want to go into the gory details. -Let's just-- -No, I want to know. When it is all over, half the world will be dead. Wow. So, I don't know whether I'd be more afraid of God or the Antichrist. God, definitely. You can hide from the Antichrist. What about all the people who claim that the Rapture isn't even in the Bible? Can you show me where it is? First Thessalonians, Chapter Four. "For the Lord shall descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and the dead in Christ shall rise first. Then we, which are alive and remain, shall be gathered up with them in the clouds to meet our Lord in the air. And so shall ever be with the Lord." Sounds good to me. I can't wait to see my dearly departed, George, waiting for me. -I'll be back tonight. -Where are you going? Just have an old friend I need to check on. Well, I don't understand. Why wouldn't you support the Eden Project? First off, I love the technology. I mean, you've done a brilliant job. It's incredibly intuitive. Any man or woman almost anywhere in the world will master it almost from the first touch. Brilliant. Much appreciated, Nicolae. And you, Jonathan, for your foresight and financial backing to make it happen. Without you, none of this would have been possible. Chaim, if you could give us a minute, please. Of course. I know it all sounds a little scary. A little scary? Then what would a lot scary found like? So, when does all this happen? I mean, are stars gonna fall from the sky the moment the peace treaty is signed? No, we still have a little time. The judgment won't start until the midpoint Of the Seven Years of Tribulation, then the Antichrist will declare himself as God. I know these political fellas have pretty high opinions of themselves. But claiming to be God seemed like a stretch even for them. - You would think so. - Mm-hmm. But the entire world will buy into it. They will fall down and worship him. Really? Buck may have lost one of his oldest friends that day. But he knew there was no time to waste feeling bad about it. First of all, nobody gets in here. The stakes were much higher than one man's death. And Buck knew that he had to get Dirk's computer before the FBI found it and buried it in a warehouse somewhere. You know the one. When he arrived at the university, They were still cleaning out Dirk's office and probably trying to crack that safe. Had almost managed to give Buck a smile. Almost. Right now though, all that matters was getting that laptop and making sure Dirk's death was not going to be in vain. - Track his buddy. - He's in this building somewhere. Shit. - There he is. - We got him. Stairs. Out of the, Hercules. The dumpster? Just in case. Let's get out of here. Let him get away. Great. I love the platform. It's just too dangerous. But, Nicolae-- I trust you both and I'm completely convinced that the platform will provide the hope that you say it well. And you had me at a disadvantage, friend. Why the hesitation? You're a good man, Jonathan. I know this. And believe me, I'm a very good judge of character. And if I wasn't completely convinced that your motives were pure, I would have never considered any of this. Well, I appreciate the trust. But? What if this were to fall in the wrong hands? What do you mean? Something were to happen to you, do you have a successor in place? Now I understand. You'll be pleased to know that I've already chosen a successor. And no one can persuade me otherwise, not even you. My choice is final. And might I ask, who would that be? Well, you, of course. You have one new voice message. First message. Mr. Williams, there's something going on here. Erica Miller is dead. They say she OD'd or something had drowned her in her bathtub. But I know that's not true. This place is swarming with Feds. They're clearing out her office. The Feds don't investigate accidents. Ivy thinks Erica stole her files and was digging into Stonagal and Dominator Analytics. And now, Mr. Plank-- well, he has the whole team drumming up a story that Dr. Burton was a suicide bomber. Look, I'm guessing this is gonna get me fired. But I feel like I have to say something. Everything that's happening in the world right now was predicted in the Bible. That's where you'll find the answers. -Hey, Ray. -Hey. Could we talk for a minute? Yeah. Of course. So you and I, we're both married to true believers. Can I ask you, what stopped you from hearing it? Oh... Well, you know, I made a lot of mistakes in my life. But blaming Irene's faith for my own bad decisions is the biggest one because she was right. But you couldn't have known that then. I would have if I'd listened. It's easier to see that now. Well, you know, not for most people, it seems. So, Irene did her job. Yeah, she did. She did. I knew it was the Rapture. But I still didn't learn my lesson. And what lesson is that? Oh, trying to find someone else to blame, you know? It's never gonna lead you to find the truth. I spent once blaming her for not trying harder. But I know if she had tried harder, I would have just walked out. And you're absolutely right. Irene did do her job. And now, it's up to me to show her that her words weren't wasted on me. So, your turn. Oh... Same story. Different excuses. I was just never able to get there. Get there. To the cross. I just could never let go of my doubt. So, what was I supposed to do? Go up there and kneel before God and lie to him? And tell him that I believed when I knew deep in my heart that I wasn't sure? Well, far be it for me to lecture anybody about faith. But I do know this. Faith isn't about having no doubt. That's not faith. That's knowledge. Faith is about taking that walk to the cross in spite of it. So... do you no longer have any doubt? Well, I saw some flaws. I think that's human nature. You know, when I first got down on my knees and asked for forgiveness, I thought that I would, you know, I have to meet Jesus halfway. But I was scared that-- I'm scared that I couldn't even get there halfway. I'd say I remember that we had this picture of Jesus that we hung at home. It was up there forever. And it said, "Behold, I stand at the door, and knock." I never knew what it meant, but I do now. He's knocking at your door right now. You don't have to meet him halfway. You just have to open a door. Chloe? When you told me to meet you here, You didn't mentioned we'd be digging someone up. Are you sure you want to do this? I don't want to. I need to. I understand. I just-- digging up a grave like this is just a little-- What, crazy? I was gonna say extreme. Well, I can say the same thing about Stonagal. At least the grave I'm digging isn't my own. Chloe, I know what you hope to find in here. But what if it's just-- Then at least I'll know. Okay. Okay. Are you ready? Chloe got what she needed that night, proof. Not just proof of the Rapture, but something much bigger. Proof that the Bible was right, that God was real, that Jesus was real. It was undeniable. And she truly believed that she had been gifted with a miracle. That Buck was there to see it with her. Even you have to admit, this is getting pretty hard to deny. Those who are gone, they knew the truth. Brothers, sisters, we can no longer hide from the truth. We must commit here and now to accepting the truth, and accepting our role and sharing it with as many people as we can. We have lied to ourselves for too long. Join me. Join us. ♪ The road I travel is the road I chose ♪ ♪ That new ways I never find ♪ Hey, aren't you ready? Look, I can't get saved as a favor to you. This is the only way. You should go. I have to make a quick call. I'll be back. Let us pray. Lord, we thank You. We know that we are rebuilding our church, Lord, and we ask for Your guidance as we go forward. We accept You into our hearts, Lord. And we are graciously thankful for Your presence with us today. Hi. It's Cameron Williams. Buck, how are you my friend? Yeah. Look, I'm fine. I don't have a lot of time. -Are you alone? -Yes. I'm calling to warn you. I have clear evidence that Jonathan Stonagal is not who he appears to be. I'm doing some digging on the guy. He's been killing people for asking too many questions. What? He's taking the entire Eden Pay Project and piggyback all kinds of extras into it. Spyware, for lack of better terms. -But how? -Trust me. He's done it. And as far as the recent vanishings, all faked by Stonagal. I have proof that he's been using you and Nicolae for his own ends. I don't know what to say. Look, I'm gonna come to you now. I'll bring the evidence. But I need you to tell Nicolae and I need you to do it now. Nicolae, I just had a very disturbing call from Cameron Williams. He says he has proof that Stonagal is setting us up, and that he has killed people in the process. Do you trust him? Cameron Williams? I have known him for years. He's always been completely honest. Then we have to bring him in. I need to confront both of them in person. I'll call an emergency meeting of the Security Council tomorrow. Good. I'm sorry, I was so stubborn. I guess now we both know how mom has to fall. Yeah. I just got off the phone with Chaim Rosenzweig. We're going to confront Stonagal with everything Dirk found. Hopefully, stop him from turning the world into a dystopian nightmare. -I'll see you soon. -Wait, Buck, wait. You really should take a look at this first. All right, I've seen all this stuff before. It's just heads and horns and beasts could mean anything. No offense to the rest of you. I just don't happen to believe our future is preordained. So, please, let me just finish-- Just let you ignore it? Because it doesn't fit your narrative? No Chloe I-- 2THES2, that was the password Dirk used to get into Eden. Okay, I'm listening. Okay. So, according to this, we should be expecting a Jewish Temple, which would replace the Dome of the Rock, which would pretty much seem impossible if it wasn't for this peace treaty that gives Israel the UN's protection. And such a treaty would also seem highly unlikely if it wasn't for this guy. Right. So, you actually think Jonathan Stonagal is the Antichrist? Well, if I had to guess right now, I'd say yes. Or what if that's what he wants you to guess? But why? What if he's trying to get the entire world to think he's here to save it? I mean, you're the one who said everyone is gonna worship this guy. Well, what about Nicolae Carpathia? I mean, certainly, he gets good crowds behind him. No, Nicolae could care less about having people love him. So, why would he pretend to be the-- Buck, we're not talking about anyone pretending to be the Antichrist. We're talking about someone being the Antichrist. Now, I can't make you believe anything. No one can. But don't turn this into a conspiracy just because you want to avoid the truth. Okay. Okay, I have seen what's inside the Eden Pay Project. And believe me, it's not a pretty picture. If this guy gets in control of the entire world's money supply. I mean, think about what that would mean. Well, I can tell you exactly what that's going to mean. He causes all both small and great, rich and poor, free and slave to receive a mark on their right hand or in their foreheads. And that no one may buy or sell except one who has the mark. Chaim just talked to Nicolae. We're going to meet first thing in the morning. I have a lot of work to do. I got to go. Bye. Pray for me. That boy is gonna need a whole lot more than prayer. Buck! Are you even listening to a word they said? You can't go there. I heard the same thing you did. Well, it doesn't look that way to me. Chloe, you found what you're looking for. And I'm so happy that you did. But that was your answer. Not mine. I'm still looking. That wasn't my answer. That was the answer. -I understand. -No, I don't think you do. I know. I have to go. I'll be very careful. I promise. Okay. Just... at least take this. I love you, Chloe Steele. I love you, too. I'm sorry to drop all this on you at the last minute. I just-- These are high stakes, Buck. I understand that. And so does Nicolae. We have to do it properly. And we will. God is with Israel, remember? Yeah. I just hope the peace accord with Israel can still happen without Stonagal. If God wants it to happen now, it will happen now. But this is not just about the peace treaty. I have long dreamed of finally having the Temple rebuilt on the Temple Mount. And when Stonagal agreed to finance it, it was the happiest day of my life. Well, what about the Dome of the Rock? Are the Arabs really just gonna let you tear it down? No. Of course not. Stonagal's team located the foundations of the original temple. It's beside the dome, not under it. -So, we can have both. -Yes. And peace in the Middle East. Arabs and Jews worshiping side by side in harmony. And even though the initial peace treaty will only be seven years, I think-- what's wrong, Buck? -Did you just say seven years? -Yes. I just need a minute. It's all real. It's all real. I didn't want to believe in you, God. But I was wrong, and I'm so sorry. Please forgive me, Jesus. I just know that I need you. And I do believe... I love you, dear Jesus. Show me what to do. Jesus promised that where two or three gather in my name, there I am with them. We gathered and we prayed. And I felt his presence for the very first time. Hey, Connor, it's me, Buck. I got your message. I just wanted to let you know you were right. I found the truth in the only place -it can be found. -Oh thank you, Jesus. I'm gonna need your help with something. - Connor. - Good, you have my message. Buck still had his focus clearly on his journalistic duty to expose Stonagal's lies. But he also knew there was a very real chance that no matter what evidence he brought to the table, old Steve Plank would never let that news see the light of day. Connor was Buck's insurance policy against being censored. And he hoped their faith would be enough to keep them from being deceived by Stonagal, even if he was working for the devil himself. -Hi. I'm-- -Mr. Cameron Williams. Good morning. Please see a member of the security team on your way in. -They'll show you the way. -Thank you. Ephesians Chapter 6 tells us to put on the full armor of God so that you can take your stand against the devil schemes. Well, Buck may not have known it. But when he walked into the room that day, he was ready. Ready like he had never been before. He hit them with everything he and Dirk had uncovered, exposing beyond the shadow of a doubt Stonagal's evil plan to deceive the world. As soon as he was finished, he felt a huge flood of relief. He had managed to get the truth to the people who needed to hear it. To enslave... Or so it seemed. So as you can clearly see this diabolical plan, not only take over the money supply, but to enslave the world in a technocratic nightmare. It was all set up at the highest levels. - What is he talking about? - Thank you. Thankfully, Mr. Williams' investigation has put the pieces together showing all of us that Jonathan has plotted, lied, and murdered, not only to gain control of Eden currency, but the entire global financial network. That's ridiculous. What's going on here? That is the question. The question each of us has been asking. What is really going on? Mr. Williams, for example, he has employed his skills to draw certain conclusions about you. But in fact, if he thinks about it hard enough, he'll have to ask himself who was on the inside that gave him access to what exactly. A highly convenient file full of evidence implicating Jonathan of all he's been accused of here today. I half expected you to see right through that. And, Chaim, your fervent dream to bring peace to Israel has been granted, if only you understood the cost. And, Jonathan, this goes much deeper for you, doesn't it? Beyond your endless thirst for more control and material gain, you really see yourself as a great man rebuilding the world in your own image. You certainly needed no help for me to see that. You have paved the way. That is your contribution to history. This is preposterous. You can't just come in here make these baseless allegations. And think you can take what I built, what is mine? How do you think you're gonna do that, Nicolae? Let me tell you what is about to happen. An assassin masquerading as a security guard Will draw his gun intent on killing Mr. Stonagal and myself. And a hail of gunfire, Mr. Cothran and Stonagal will be fatally wounded. I'll barely escape with my life. Thanks to security guards who quickly returned fire. You're insane. What makes you think you can get away with this? By... simply killing you. You see, Jonathan, there will be peace. But not with you. Nicolae. Your time is over. But mine has just begun. And now, now I am devastated by the loss. Yet, forced... to take up the mantle of his leadership. Oh, my God! We need to get some help. Chaim, are you okay? It was awful. One of the security guards started firing. Hey, did you see what happened? Yes. Poor Nicolae. I mean, who want to kill him? Mr. Williams, this is crazy. Did you see it? I think I know what really happened. Come with me. Buck, are you okay? Hey, what's going on? Yeah, yeah, okay. Yes. Ladies and gentlemen, my name is Nicolae Carpathia. And I come to you tonight with a heavy heart. - Good afternoon. - My name is Cameron Williams. I'm here to tell you a story. Story about lies from the media, murder, story about the only truth that matters. Nicolae Carpathia is the new Secretary General of the UN. Right now, he's making a speech. Well, I'm here to tell you. It's all lies. Looks like Cameron Williams finally found the truth. Yes. He's gotta be on this floor. He told you that the vanishings came with no warning, with no explanation. That there was a second wave of vanishing. And worst of all, he told you that the Rapture had been debunked. Take a picture of your screen right now-- Turn it off! And no matter what you may hear, it's not too late to let Jesus Christ set you free. I'm proof of that. When Buck's broadcast went out to the world, it felt like a huge victory. But the Bible warned us it wouldn't be as easy as just telling everyone the truth. But I've always thought, and now I believe that even if a single soul is saved, then your efforts have not been in vain. Right now though, the impact of Buck's message would have to be analyzed later. He knew some people were bound to disagree with what he had to say. Get those there. Thanks. Buck! Buck! Run! - Are you guys okay? - Yeah. We made it just in time. You've got to stop doing this to me. - Everyone okay? - Yeah. All good. They were all so anxious and even excited to start sharing the word with the world. It was wonderful to see. But they'd only been studying prophecy for a few days. The reality of the final seven years before the return of Christ hadn't started sinking in just yet. Jesus told us these last years would be worse than anything the world had ever seen. Right, here's a good spot, all right? God gave us an exemption if we wanted it. But for those of us who chose not to take it, those of us who were left behind, well, we'll just have to see what happens. I know there's nothing we can do to stop what's been prophesied from happening. But that doesn't mean we just give up. Not even close. There are souls to be saved. And as long as there are, our mission is clear. Look what it says. - Are you reading this? - That's incredible.
