--== McEphie ==-- {\a6}[teacher speaking English] {\a6}Now, last but not the least. {\a6}[inhales] Good morning. My name is Fidel Lansangan. BA Psychology. I turned 17 last month. I hope to make friends while I'm here in PAC. Interests and hobbies? [in Tagalog] Stop looking at your cue cards. [in English] Just tell us your interests and hobbies. [students laughing] My... [stammering] My hobbies and interests are... Ma'am... [stammering in Tagalog] I'm always... I'm always at home. I love writing poetry. I always-- [school bell ringing] [teacher speaking English] Next meeting, 2x2 picture, please! Don't forget. Bye! -Bye, teacher. -Bye. -Don't forget 2x2 picture next meeting. -Yes, ma'am. Lansangan? Yes, ma'am? So you like writing poetry? Yes, ma'am. I haven't mentioned, I'm the faculty adviser of The Seedling. [in Tagalog] You might want to submit one of your poems. About what, ma'am? [in English] Anything that inspires you. [Fidel] Behold. Behold, this is a new life. Ugh... Phase. Start. Ah... Chapter? [man] Fidel? Pa! [man] Fidel? [in Tagalog] Son, bribe from your mother. So you won't hate her. She should have given you a shirt, too. Anyway, that's fine. Wear that on Freshie's Night. I think I won't attend, Pa. [stammering] Tomorrow, my first class is at 8:00. I might-- Fidel! Fidel! Remember what the therapist said? [in English] Three-word rule. [in Tagalog] Maximum of three words per sentence. Okay? I... Am... Fidel... Course... Is... Psych... [stammers] What... Is... Your... Section? What's... Your... Section? What's... Your... Block? [groans] [guitar music playing] You're blocking the way! Can we do the sound check? [in English] Excuse me. [in Tagalog] You dropped your... [stammers] You dropped your wallet! You're late again! I told you to come with me. [clicks tongue] Look at the time. [in English] Excuse me. Excuse me. [in Tagalog] Your-- That's mine! [students laughing] Chill. They never start on time. Start setting up. I'm almost there. [all chattering] [singing in distance] [singing stops] Are you the one singing? Are you the one singing? Am I being haunted now? Why don't you go inside? I'll just go... -Huh? -[stammering] I'll just go home. Why? My pants are... stained in the butt. Stand up. Stand up! Let me see. [chuckles] Hands up. There. Good to go. Thank God it didn't rain. They said it would rain. Haven't brought an umbrella for three years now. What do you like more, sunny or rainy? Sunny. What? I hate gloomy weather. Really? Listening to music is better when it's raining. Looking at the mountain, drinking beer. Do you drink beer? You don't talk much, do you? I have a speech defect. I don't stutter when I read. I do when I speak long sentences. That's why I limit myself to three words per sentence. Why limit to three? So I won't stutter. So what if you stutter? They'll laugh at me. [Stella chuckles] Then what? So what if they laugh? We're in college now. College is the time to know yourself. Once you do... be proud. All right. I'll see you around the campus. Finish this. Tastes good. Yo, Freshies! [all cheering] Thank you! Thank you for coming! Okay. Let me tell you a secret. [chuckles] Truth is, I'm the only freshie in this band. [all cheering] If you haven't noticed, these guys are oldies! [all cheering] See their eye circles? [all cheering] We are the... Tampururaught band! Special mention to my classmates in Psych. Where are you, guys? Here, here, here, here! Don't worry, once we graduate, we'll comprehend our insanity. Right? [all cheering] And also, special mention to my new friend, Fidel! Don't get too nervous. You can do it. One, two, one, two, three, four! [playing rock music] [all cheering] [singing] See these thousands of people Each with his own path to pave For sure we'll struggle and get scared And lose hope in dreaming They'll say you'll never reach the stars Just follow the beat of your heart We can do it La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la One day, we will doubt ourselves After tripping over countless times Let's cry over our miseries together And then together we stand tall They'll say you'll never reach the stars Just follow the beat of your heart We can do it La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la La la la la la la la la la [all cheering] [Fidel] Since then, I was inspired. Girl with Black lipstick... "Her lipstick is black But her heart is pure I was amazed By her allure" It's simple... but cute. [stammers] Will it get published? Well, [in English] that's up to the literary editor to decide. [in Tagalog] Let's just wait for the next issue, okay? [boy] Mr. Rasul is here! [Mr. Rasul speaking English] Good morning, class. [all] Good morning, sir. [Mr. Rasul] Walking, right? [all] Yes, sir. [Stella] Sir! [in Tagalog] Sorry, I'm late. Why is your lipstick black, miss? [all laughing] Why is the sky blue? [all laughing] Why is your blood red? Sir, why do we turn yellow with hepatitis? [all laughing] Ever thought about that? Figure it out, sir. [Stella] Shh... [Mr. Rasul speaking English] We do walking almost every day. [in Tagalog] Why is it in PE? What's up with your shorts? Why did you take walking for PE? It's easy. [panting] Are you all right? Yes. -[Fidel retching] -[Stella] Go. Just let it out. [Fidel gasping] [Fidel] Sorry, it's disgusting. Don't look. Disgusting? You should've seen me when I first got drunk. You practice race walking later. [both imitating stammering] Are you okay, Fidel? Pregnant, right? Is this how you throw up? [imitating retching] Want me to kick your balls? I guess I'll see my bandmates. -Stella? -Mmm? [stammers] I love to write... poems. Really? And then? [stammering] I can't talk properly. I also suck at an easy PE class like walking. You must think... I'm a wimp. Of course not. You're the only one who thinks so. [stammers] I submitted one of my poems to The Seedling. Mmm-hmm? Wait for it in the next issue. Okay. I'll wait for it. What's the title? Just wait. What is it? You'll see. Bummer. [Fidel] Poem number two: "Destiny." "I don't believe in destiny But now I think I do I am thrilled and happy I hope this pushes through" Poem number seven: "Bad Luck Magnet." "I am a bad luck magnet Failed by my pants and stomach I am amazed that sometimes Bad luck comes with surprises" [Stella] Have you been to the other side of Mt. Arayat? [Fidel] Not yet. [Stella] Come on, let's go! I have class. Jeez! Just this once. I can't. Next time, come with me. Ma'am... [stammering] Why wasn't it published? Is it bad? [in English] Fidel, it doesn't mean it's bad. I'm sorry, [in Tagalog] but the literary editor might be looking for something else. [in English] Let me guess. You wanted someone to see the poem. [in Tagalog] The girl with black lipstick? Is that why you're so affected? Fidel, just give it to her directly. It's for her anyway, right? Ma'am, I have written many poems for her. Uh-huh... Can you pick... Can you pick the best... for her? [chuckles] How many are there? Ten. [in English] How sweet. [in Tagalog] Give her all of them. [in English] I'm sure she'll be flattered. [Barrie in Tagalog] Skip class tomorrow. Let's just hang out. I might flunk. My sister will scold me. Won't it just be your first time skipping class? You got a point. Actually, tomorrow, I've only got NatSci and PE. I think we can hang out. [in English] Nice! [in Tagalog] I want to go AWOL. Why go AWOL? Stella, we're special. We were born to rock and roll. My socio prof said, [in English] "Formal education only seeks to manufacture workers for greedy capitalists." [in Tagalog] Shall we join the system or revolt against it? You're actually deep. But stubborn. [chuckles] Come here, you. Stop it! I'm ticklish. [both laughing] Fine! I'll skip class tomorrow. [Barrie] Really? [Stella] Yes. Son, let's eat. I'm not hungry. Are you okay? How's school? Fine. Know what, son? You must do well in school. Once you graduate, I'm sure companies will fight over you. [in English] Ten seconds more. The higher the pulse rate, the healthier you are. Okay, time's up! Excuse me. Lansangan, right? [in Tagalog] We're classmates in Comm. [in English] I'm Danica Sandico. [in Tagalog] I sit in the front. Anyway, we're going to study for the midterms. Want to come? [indistinct] Let's go? Okay. [in English] See? You made it through two semesters already. [in Tagalog] Time flies so fast, right? The other day you were just scolding us over our failed reporting. -Mmm-hmm. -Right? [all laughing] Ma'am. [in English] Yes? [stammers] Ma'am, when can we see our grades in Social Science 2? [in Tagalog] Don't worry. You all passed. [all cheering] [imitates stammering] Mr. Grade-conscious, let's eat first! Indeed. So, you brats, let's party! [all chattering] Don't worry, Mr. Lansangan. You got the highest grade. Are you planning on transferring to Manila? I don't know yet, ma'am. My sisters will kill me. I got horrible grades. All of my classes. Even Psych 101? Especially Psych 101. That class was very easy! It's because... It's because you're stubborn! [stammering] You waste your time on unimportant things! Why don't you just study hard? You're always late. You're always absent. You go... You go to class groggy. The band gets a lot gigs lately. I need time for-- Think about your future! You can't always live in the moment! [in English] Sorry. [in Tagalog] Don't be sorry. You're right. Can you... help me with my studies next school year? Please? If... If help is all you need... why not? But... help is all I can give. You have to do the actual work. Of course. So, see you in June. Take care. You too. Poem number 12, "Study Buddy." "In our Biology class next semester We will examine the frogs and tadpoles If ever we're classmates in Chemistry We will study... free electrons?" Poem number 20: "LPA." "Here comes typhoon season But I fear none Just one gaze at you And I have my sun" Fidel! -Stella! -What's up? Check out that hair! Why so nice? Let's fix it. Hey! Hey! What? I'm just not used to it. [stammers] I'm not used to seeing you without your makeup and lipstick. Does it look bad? No! What's your schedule? Here. I just got it. Let me see. Look. We're classmates in Hum 1 and Comm 3. So early! [in English] Hi, guys! Stella Puno. Psych. [in Tagalog] I love music. My favorite band is Rivermaya. I also love Barbie's Cradle. Of course, Sugarfree. -[boy] Go, Tampururaught! -[chuckles] We've disbanded. Studies first. [in English] Hi. My name is Fidel Lansangan. I am 18 years old-- What are you reading? This is Communication 3. You're supposed to learn how to speak spontaneously. [stammers in Tagalog] Sir, I can recite better when I use-- [in English] Put it down. [in Tagalog] Poem number 20: "Rose." "Under that black lipstick Are rose-colored lips She still looks cool Ever extraordinary" [singing in English] Somebody owns you now I'll try to live somehow [in Tagalog] Amazing how they came up with those lyrics. So sad! It's brilliant. Let's rewind. That's what I like about Filipino music today. They focus on the emotions. Not much sexy stuff. No corny digital instruments. [chuckles] -Right? -Mmm. Know what? I'll lend this to you. Which one? This. I want this back. Take care of it. It's my favorite. I'll lend you the others, too. Here. What? They're good. Listen to Sugarfree. Try track four. People are... People are using CDs now. Why all these tapes? I don't like CDs. They break easily. Besides, I don't have a player. Do you have... a recording of... that song you performed last Freshies' Night? No, I don't. We were supposed to record a demo last summer. But Barrie and I broke up. Career and love life never go well with each other. Broke up? Grab your stuff. Hurry! Hurry up! Come, I'll show something. -Come on. -Stella, wait! -What? Hurry! -This is the ladies' room! [stammers] They might think I'm peeping. Do you see anybody else? Hurry up. Close the door. Get in! Stella. Shh. Look at these. [giggles] [Fidel] "Who's your crush?" [Stella] This barely had any responses back then. Look at it now! [Fidel] Have you answered? [in English] Secret! [in Tagalog] Seriously. Where's your answer? -You wanna know? -Mmm. [Fidel] Hmm? [stammers] What? Our teacher in Walking? Yes. Seriously? [laughing] Of course not! That's foolish! I'm sure most of the answers here aren't serious. You really believed I had a crush on Mr. Rasul? Marker. Hand me a marker. FIDEL "HUGE" LANSANGAN [Fidel] What are you doing? What is that? Why? When girls who know you read this, and they encounter you on the campus, they will never look at you the same way again. Genius! -You are crazy. -[woman calling out] [knock on door] [woman] Is anybody in there? Open the door. Go in there! Hurry! [opening door] [conversing indistinctly] I still have class. So? I can't be late. [Stella] Keep it down! They'll leave at some point. Relax. [woman 1] Huge? [woman 2 laughing] [woman 2] Is he really? His name's familiar. He's our classmate in one subject! I remember now... What if we're in a relationship? What? We can pretend to be lovers. So even if they see us here together, they'd just say, "Look at those lovers, they had to do it in the bathroom 'cause they couldn't wait." You're such a goof. Why? Kiss me out there. Stop it. [both laughing] [chattering indistinctly] Just a sec. What happened to you? He joined a fraternity. Had their initiation. [Stella] You joined a fraternity? He thinks he's cool. Stella, you look different now. Where are you going? Hang out with us. No, thanks. We're going home. Let's go home. Is he your boyfriend? Fidel is my friend. That's a relief. -Thought you'd replace me with some loser. -[all laughing] Loser? Loser, eh? He's a nice kid. Helpful, hardworking, smart. And you? So full of yourself, yet your grades are pathetic. Wait. And that hat. You think it looks good on you? Feel cool with it? It's ridiculous. [Barrie] You! Are you courting Stella? [stammers] No, we're just friends. [imitating chicken clucking] Sounds like a hen! Come on, let's go home. Stella. Do you like him? If I tell you I do, what's it to you? Come on. Poem number 28: "Filthy." "Am I ambitious to believe That you like me, too? I'm just a filthy kid Asking the heavens for you" How many poems will you give her? [in English] Thirty. Thirty? Ma'am? [sniffling] [stammers in Tagalog] Are you all right? Damn it, Fidel! Why do you keep bothering me with your love life? Don't you have a mother? I don't. She's no... She's no longer with my father. -I'm sorry. -It's okay. [in English] I'm just... They brought my daughter to a rehab yesterday. [in Tagalog] I might resign from school so I can look after her. [in English] I don't know where I went wrong as a mother. [in Tagalog] I gave her everything she wanted. [in English] My husband and I thought she was going to take up Law. But people change. [in Tagalog] One day, she's a top student. [in English] The next day, she's an... She's... an addict! [crying] Ma'am. [in Tagalog] Maybe if the next day, she's an addict, the day after, she might change. Me, for instance. [stammers] They think I'm an addict with the way I speak. [chuckles] Fidel! [sighs] You're such a comedian. You know what my dream is? To perform for a large crowd. I want to see everyone doing this... singing along because they know my song's lyrics. Kick-ass, right? [stammering] Your dream is nice. Just don't neglect your studies. Yeah. So even if you don't reach your dream, you have a fallback. I know. Can you help with my Psych Stat? The midterm is coming. When are you free? Sunday night. I'll just go to your house. Our house is so-so. Did I say I'm buying it? We're just studying. Before I forget. My poems. I want you to read them. I don't have a PC. I'll read them on your computer on Sunday. What are they about? Hey! What about? Never mind. You'll see on Sunday. Hey, you! Didn't I tell you to quit your band? I saw on your classmate's Friendster you're performing in school. What? Our last performance was last year. Stop messing around. Messing around? Here. Shove my grades in your face. If only you studied this hard last school year, your transcript wouldn't look so bad. Companies take a look at these things. Wow. "Stella, your grades are high this semester. Congratulations. Keep it up." That sounds better, right? Damn this life. Can't do anything right. Stella, Mommy and Daddy are gone. You should fix your life. So I could follow Ulysses in Canada. I'm tired of looking after you. Go to him. Fly to Canada. Don't mind me. Give me that. [music on TVs playing] Here. This explains the cowboy hat. Biceps Boys! Damn corny, right? After we disbanded, an agent contacted me. At first, I wanted to decline, but I couldn't resist the pay. You never told me. I posted a bulletin on Friendster. You know I rarely go online. You could've texted me. Text? We weren't good. We broke up. Why would I tell you? Don't you love me anymore? Poem number 38: "Coffee." "It's past 11:00 already Still awake as the Boogeyman In bed, I toss and turn You're stronger than coffee" Poem number 50: "No Title." "This soldier is now ready To march without a crutch Here it goes, don't shoot me I like you very, very much" Son? Pa. What's the occasion? Our home is so tidy. [stammers] My friend and I are just going to review. Girl or guy? Pa, does it matter? Pa, we're just going to review! [in English] Just in case! [in Tagalog] Milk is pricey these days. -Good luck! -Good luck, guys, later. Who are you looking at? Who are you looking at? Is that guy the boss of Stratus Records? Yes, that's our boss. The one on stage is our road manager. Why? Maybe you can introduce me to them later? Of course. But they're busy now. I'll try. Why though? Nothing. Eat well. Guys, backstage. All right, all right. Good luck! Good luck! Break a leg! Stella, can I ask you a favor? Can you not watch our performance? What? Why? I'm feeling really shy. What a bummer! [crowd cheering] [in English] Horrible, right? [in Tagalog] One of them is my boyfriend. [chuckles] [in English] Yikes. Awkward. I'm Hunter, by the way. [in Tagalog] I'm directing their music video. You're a director? [in English] Wait, wait. Don't move. Sorry, [in Tagalog] it's just the way light hits your face. [in English] Anyway, I just came to meet with the, uh... talents I'll be working with soon. More like, working "on." [in Tagalog] If only I wasn't friends with those at Stratus. [in English] It's nice to meet you. [Barrie speaking Tagalog] Someone talked to me at the bar earlier. An old man. A clerk in a bank. My God, he gave me an indecent proposal! Crazy, right? You do look like a stripper. Really now? Really? Wow! -Male stripper, huh? -With matching prop! [laughs] Yuck! That's disgusting. Enough. Stop it. You look stupid. Disgusting. Sit down. You know what? I missed you. Well, I'll go home now. Whoa, whoa, whoa. It's getting late. I'll get scolded. It's still early. I really need to go. Come on, stay here first. Seriously. I'll go ahead. Stop. I'll go ahead. Old times' sake? [rooster crowing] What day is it? What? What day is it? Monday, why? Shit. No, why? Fidel and I were supposed to review together yesterday. It's almost midterm. Fidel? That stuttering nerd? Watch your language. He's nice. Where were you supposed to study? At his place. With other classmates? Just us. Careful. You never know what he might do. Like what you did to me? Danica, do you want a photocopy of this? Sure. Just tell the photocopier guy it's for Danica. He'll let you skip the line. How come? We're cousins. Fidel. I've been looking everywhere for you. Sorry. I was in Manila last night. You could've texted me. Hey. Are you mad? Could you just... Could you just bug me later? [shushing] Is that so? Later then! -Stella! -[clattering] [all shushing] Stella! Stella! What? What's your problem? Problem? Why are you doing this to me? I said I'm sorry. What did I do to you for you to treat me like that? I waited for you. [scoffs] There! Can't you study on your own? Are you serious with your... Your academics? [stammering] It's midterm next week. Why so complacent? You prioritized your thing with Barrie. I thought... [stammers] I thought you broke up? Fidel, Barrie joined a boy band in Manila. I went there with him to make connections. I want to be part of their recording company. If you were me, would you pass up the opportunity? Besides, I'm sick of school. What will I do with Psych? You know that music is my passion. Fidel, we're reforming Tampururaught. Barrie's no longer the bassist, but he's financing the demo recording. He's also endorsing us to Stratus. You need to choose. Studies... or band? [singing in English] I wanted to turn you on My favorite song Wanted to be near you but Somebody owns you now I'll try to live somehow Somebody owns you now Somebody owns you now [in Tagalog] Call me once you get to your dorm. I loaded you up with 300 phone credits. Don't forget. Yes, Pa. [in English] Three-word rule. [in Tagalog] Take care. [in English] Thank you, Pa. [in Tagalog] Take care. [beatboxing] It's your first time seeing a gay beatboxer, right? [in English] Hello, I'm Chuck. BA Philo. Fidel. BA Psych. [in Tagalog] Sing for me. I'll beatbox for you. I don't sing. I'm not good. I'm not expecting a Mark Bautista kind of performance. Come on. [beatboxing] [singing in English] I wanted to turn you on My favorite song Wanted to be near you but Of course, somebody owns you now I'll try to live somehow Somebody owns you now Somebody owns you now [Chuck stops beatboxing] You have to attend every single one, okay? Hello, guys! [in Tagalog] We have a new applicant! You need to hear him sing. You can do it. [in English] Young Performer's Guild! [in Tagalog] Refuse, and I'll burn your bed in the dorm. Show them your talent. Come on. He's good. [in English] Hi, I'm Mike, President of this guild. Now, tell me, [in Tagalog] what's your background in singing? [stammering] No background, sir. I really don't sing. Liar! Come on! Let us hear it, please. Are you gonna let us hear you sing or not? 'Cause you're wasting our freakin' time. [stammers] There's so many people in here. [imitates stammering] For Christ's sake! [all laughing] [in English] Come back when you're no longer a pussy. Okay? [scoffs] Chuck. [in Tagalog] You just found him cute, so you brought him here. [in English] I swear he's great! [in Tagalog] He could be an asset to the group. You're all just acting like bitches. We need talented and confident members. Not talented alone, not confident alone. [in English] Let's build his confidence! I promise, he'll be worth the patience. -[in Tagalog] Earlier in our dorm-- -[Fidel] This song is called "Balisong" [singing in English] Your face lights up the sky on the highway Someday You'll share your world with me, someday You mesmerized me with diamond eyes I try to fool myself to think I'll be all right But I am losing all control My mind, my heart, my body and my soul [man] One, two, three, four. [singing] Never in my life have I been more sure [beatboxing] So come on up to me and close the door Nobody's made me feel this way before You're everything I wanted and more You're everything I wanted You're everything I wanted You're everything I wanted and more [all cheering] [in Tagalog] Again, we are the Young Performer's Guild, the #1 performing arts group here in PRU. [in Tagalog] If you know how to play instruments, dance, act, or sing, [in English] our org... Rather, our family will be very happy to have you as a member. [all applauding] [in Tagalog] Surely, many will join our organization. Most of them are your fans. Our fans. Congrats. [cell phone ringing] [in English] Hello? [in Tagalog] Fidel? It's Danica. Danica who? Danica! Will you be back in Pampanga this semester break? Why? It's my birthday in November. The celebration will be in Fontana. I sent you the invitation to our Yahoo group. [stammers] I'm quite busy. Really? Even during the break? Don't you miss the block? Joeffer, Mads and Lester are going. How... How about Stella? I don't know. I sent her an invite, but she hasn't confirmed. [upbeat music playing] [people chattering] [in English] Excuse me. -Happy birthday! -Thank you! [in Tagalog] Why are you quiet? Don't mind me. [knocking] Fidel! -Fidel! -[in English] Happy birthday! Thank you! -[in Tagalog] Am I late? -Not really? -I brought pizza. -Thank you. [all cheering] [all chattering] Carry me, Fidel! It's my birthday. Where should I take you? Here? Farther! Farther! Come on. On the other side. Hurry! Stella? You're so slow. Just a sec. Stella! How are you? What? How are you? I'm fine. How about you? Why are you late? What? What? Why are you late? Oh, why am I late? I waited for my sister Shirley to come home first. Aren't you swimming? What's that? Aren't you swimming? Nah! I have no extra clothes. Wait for me. [stammers] I'll just change. You'll change. Okay. I'll join you in a bit. Remember our Freshies' Night? The first time we met? And? So weird. It was noisy at the gym entrance. But I clearly heard someone singing. Are you sure that wasn't you? [stammering] Let's say that was indeed me. The gym's entrance was far from my spot. How did my voice reach the entrance? [laughing] I was belting? I don't know. Come to think of it, the singer wasn't stuttering. It might not be you. Actually, when I sing... I don't. Don't what? I don't stutter. See? That was you! Magic? The universe conspired so we could meet that night. So the universe is a singer now? I also have... something to clarify. What is it? Why were you so nice to me back then? Back then? Not anymore? What I mean is... of all people you could be nice to... of all people you could befriend... why me? I don't know. You see, some relationships... don't require reasons. Some... just happen. [all cheering] Me again? Fine, bastards! Dare! Here's your dare. Give a dirty dance to your ultimate crush here. [all cheering] [boy] I'm pressured. [all exclaiming excitedly] Stop me! [in English] Truth or Dare? Dare! [in Tagalog] If you're still a virgin, walk like a Miss Universe. [all cheering] You thought I wouldn't do it? [all shouting] Stella! [in English] Truth or Dare? Truth or Dare? Dare or Truth? [in Tagalog] Fine. Truth. Gee, I don't know what to ask. We barely see you these days. Do you still go to class? That's the question? Joeffer, you're wasting it. Among our blockmates, who, for you, can pass as your boyfriend? The one with whom you can imagine yourself claiming... "Sure! Let's be a couple." Politically incorrect question! Why limit it to just "boyfriend"? Fine! Boyfriend or girlfriend or anything you like. Answer it! [in English] One, two, three, four-- [in Tagalog] No, actually, I already have a boyfriend. He'll pick me up tomorrow. [boy] Who's your boyfriend? Hunter. Who? -Where's he from? -He's a director from Manila. Why are there follow-up questions? Spin it. [in English] Wait! You didn't answer the question. The question is, [in Tagalog] who among our blockmates can pass as your boyfriend? Your relationship status is irrelevant. Answer it! [retching] [all screaming] [boy] What a party-pooper! I heard inside that you have a new boyfriend. Yet again. We were batchmates in high school. You had six boyfriends, right? Nice. [in English] Judgmental. [in Tagalog] I'm not judging you. Of all things, why bring that up? That was your reputation in high school. Don't worry. It's normal to look for people to cling to. Especially when you feel unloved. Why are you even here? Are you our blockmate? Von, Grandpa wants to talk to you. Find a quiet spot. Okay. Hello, Grandpa? Who's that? Oh, him? He's Von, my cousin. Library photocopier guy. I guess he's not familiar to you because... you barely go to the library. I was just asking. [in English] Hey, excuse me, bro! [in Tagalog] I'm looking for a villa occupied by a bunch of students from PAC. I forgot the number, but I know it's on this street. [in English] 3226. [in Tagalog] Right. Thanks! And you are? Oh, right. I'm Hunter. I'm picking up my girlfriend. Stella. [Chuck] This is so romantic, Fidel! [in English] Fifty poems! [in Tagalog] Why didn't you give these to her? She has a boyfriend. Hello! You could've done it way back. What's the point? [stammers] Stella wants her dreams to come true. These won't help her. I'm a bit nervous, sweetheart. [in English] You're perfect. You're gonna be a star. I promise you. Come here. -[in Tagalog] Wait. My lipstick... -[scoffs] [in English] Sorry. [sighs] It's almost 1:00 now. [in Tagalog] Let's go. [song playing on laptop] [in English] Catchy, right? [in Tagalog] Would be a great carrier single for an album. [in English] The market is already saturated with this brand of music. [in Tagalog] We have Kitchi Nadal, Barbie Almalbis, and dozens of others who try to emulate the same branding. How is yours different? [in Tagalog] Well, I was thinking of making Stella's image much darker. Sometimes drifting towards punk. -Something like-- -Avril Lavigne... sir. How old are you, Stella? Eighteen, sir. You're familiar with Lolligurlz, right? [Stella] I'm not a kid! Don't tell me what I can and cannot do! [in English] Are you fucking serious, Stella? Lolligurlz? [in Tagalog] Gyrating like a go-go dancer [in English] while singing awful songs about God-knows-what? [in Tagalog] If that's what it takes to get into the industry, then fine, I'll do it! We've been together for a year now. Nothing's happening! I haven't gone places. [car tires screeching] [in English] Is that what I am for you, Stella? [in Tagalog] So you'd achieve your ambitions? That's it? See this? See this? Fine. Watch this. What the hell? Stop! Enough already! Sweetheart, that's enough. Don't you ever call me "sweetheart"! You're a user! [in English] Get out! I said get the hell out of my car! [strumming chord loudly] Stella! Are you ever going back to school? Your professor told me you no longer go to class. What are you doing? Band stuff again? Please. If you plan to lecture me, not today. I'm not in the mood. Shine and I already spoke to you about this. I already told you. So what if this is what I wanted? We gave you a chance before. What happened? Nothing! When you need money, who do you pester? -Me! -Who else can I turn to? You're such a burden! -Why are you blaming me? -You're ruining my plans! Ulysses is getting impatient there in Canada. So this is about him. Then go! If you can't wait to fuck, by all means, go! I'm sick of this house. I'm sick of you! [in English] Oh, my God! Abnormal Psych is so haggard. Who's gonna report for our group? [stammers in Tagalog] Me, but ma'am might get annoyed with my speech. [all laugh] Fine, I volunteer! Just don't fail me in the peer evals. -[in English] Go, Erin! -Thank you! [cell phone ringing] Hello? Stella? Fidel? [in Tagalog] Are you in Manila? Yes, why? Nothing. I just wanted to see you. Is there a problem? Nothing, nothing! I just want to hang out. Actually, [stammers] I'm finishing a paper with my groupmates. I see. It's fine. Just focus. No, no, no. Wait. Uh... What time can you come here in Manila? Sir, your order. How's my hair? Looks good, sir! Fidel. Sorry, I got lost. It's fine. Choose your order. My treat. [stammers] Their bestseller here is pork tonkatsu. I'll just have a beer. How are you? It's been a while. You've been busy. Very! I'm also vying for honors. Busy with the rehearsals of the Performer's Guild. Really? You're performing? How about you? How's your... How's your... boyfriend? Hunter? We broke up. Thank you. That's good. What's good? The first time I saw him, I didn't like his aura. [chuckling] Aura. -[laughing] -You're psychic now? How about you? Do you have a girlfriend? Me? None. Why? [in English] Busy. [in Tagalog] How come you were able to squeeze me into your schedule? Of course. It's you. [crying] Back then... my big sisters used to sing, too. Whenever there was a fiesta, we were always called to perform. Now, it's over. They quit because... Mommy and Daddy had an accident. [in English] Sorry. [in Tagalog] My sister Sunshine left right away to work abroad. My sister Shirley transferred to Nursing. That's the popular course now, right? That's why they're doing this to me... Why they're forcing me to quit. It's unfair that they want me to quit just because they did. That's the practical thing to do. Maybe they're thinking, "We already gave up. So should you." Stella, it's all right. Fidel... I ran away from home. I'm begging you. Can I sleep in your dorm? [stammering] I don't think outsiders are allowed to sleep over. Is it okay if I bring you to a hotel? -No, it's fine. -I'll pay for it. No, it's fine. -Stella-- -Forget it. It's on me. No. That's expensive. I'm sorry. [stammering] This is all I can afford. Will you be okay here? Yeah. Well... You better rest now. Just text me your plan tomorrow. You're leaving me here alone? Hmm? You're leaving me here alone? Help me out. Would you like me... to stay for a while? I hope so. Hold on! I haven't brushed my teeth. I ate-- I don't mind. Hold on. What's the matter? I know you drank a lot. I'm not drunk! I don't know what you're going through. But I know you're confused. I don't want to take advantage of... your weakness. [crying] -Hey. -Hmm? I can't sleep. Just close your eyes. What? Close your eyes. Mmm. Want me to sing to you? [both laughing] I might have a nightmare. [clears throat] [singing in English] I wanted to turn you on My favorite song Wanted to be near you but Somebody owns you now I'll try to live somehow [in Tagalog] I knew it. You were the one singing back in Freshies' Night. Nope. That's you! What were you singing then? That's not me. It's you! I remember your voice. What were you singing? "Itsumo." Dice & K9. Want me to sing it? -No! Please don't! -I'm gonna sing it now. [laughing] It's annoying! I don't like it. Just continue what you were singing. Wait. What's this for? For... For what? Tell me! You have no idea? What? There's a bed. There's a mirror. In a motel. Yuck! Stop it! [Fidel reading in English] "Imagining it can seem disgusting But at the same time full of bliss I mean lips and spit go wrestling? That's the mystery of the kiss" [reading] "She's pretty when she tries To crush foes with her knuckles She's prettier when she cries But prettiest when she chuckles" [in Tagalog] Sit. Break a leg. Filipino time is a crime in YPG. Sorry, I had an emergency. You even brought a chick! That's Stella. I don't give a damn about-- Stella? As in your Stella? Come on. [in English] Let's go. [singing] I wanted to turn you on My favorite song Wanted to be near you but Somebody owns you now I'll try to live somehow Somebody owns you now Somebody owns you now [all cheering] [in Tagalog] We are the Young Performers Guild! [in English] Welcome to PRU! Thank you. Congrats, Fidel! Thank you. [in Tagalog] Hey. You okay? Yeah. So you're a rock star here, huh? Nah. Just a bit! Bro, congrats! -Thanks! -Congrats, Fidel! Excuse me. Someone wants to talk to you. Hello! -You're the vocalist from earlier, right? -Yes, sir. Terrific! Brilliant! I am Edmond Salvador. I own this small live music bar in Cubao called Tipsy Tarsier. [exclaiming excitedly] That's a very fun place! Anyway, I'll leave you to talk. -Bye, sir. -Bye. Yeah, I'd like to get you as a regular performer. Genre is acoustic. I have an in-house guitarist already. [stammering] Must be cool to perform in this kind of place. They'll even pay me. Maybe I should go tonight. Can I come? Refer me to Sir Edmond. Let's go together. Then... we'll jam so he could see you, too. Not right away. Once you become a regular, I'll go. I have an idea. I'll tell him... I have academic problems... so I can't come. Then I'll refer you. Take his card. This is your dream, right? Much more than it's mine. To perform for a crowd. You begin with covers. It's a good start. Who knows? Someone might discover you. No, it's okay. You're the one invited. Besides... I need to go. My sister's looking for me. I'll take you to the station. It's fine. I'll take a taxi. Thanks a lot. Thanks for everything. Bye. Stella! The semester ends in a month. Let's catch up when I go home. All right? [reading in English] "They say nobody's perfect But haven't they seen you? -Cubao, please. -Heard you? Experienced you? You are divine [in Tagalog] You were gone all night. Where have you been? You're not replying to my messages. Have you eaten? I'm just here for my guitar. [reading in English] Your perfection deserves nothing but perfection Let me trek up this mountain and meet you there at the top My regal star" [reading] The way she walks, the way she sings Give me a pair of magical wings That fly me straight to the stratosphere She is a miracle, that much is clear" Hey! [Fidel reading] "How many women Can inspire a lonely man To give birth to A whole museum of art? To me, there's only one" [in Tagalog] Hey! Thief! [Fidel reading in English] "Pardon me if I take too long When you see this peasant again I want to be worthy And worth it And worthwhile" Stella? Fidel? [in Tagalog] Pardon the mess. I'm the only one here. I rarely get visitors. One sec. Von, can I take a shower? Wait. I'll check for roaches. -No, it's fine. -Just sit down. I'll just check. I'll be back. All done! No more monsters in the shower. It's in English now. How many have you done? [in English] Ninety. What the fudge! [in Tagalog] You're getting obsessed! What's your plan? [stammering] I'll give Stella 100 poems when I return to Pampanga. For what? So... I will impress her. Then what? Then... she'll be my girlfriend. Are you sure? [chuckles] [rooster crows] I already washed your clothes. I know you're not used to men's wear. They're actually comfortable. Did you sleep well? I'm sorry. My room is worse. I smell a dead rat, but I haven't found it yet. I'll go ahead. Are you sure you're okay here? I can ask Danica to let you stay in their house. No need, no need. Uh... Can you not tell anyone I'm here? I'm really fine staying here. While you're away, do you want me to look for the dead rat? [Fidel reading in English] "I dream of you every single night Slam-dancing on a silver pedestal Dazzling the hall with your fiery light Growling at us, them lesser mortals" [crying] [in Tagalog] Hey, Stella! I can't take it anymore! I can't take it anymore! I want to be with Mommy and Daddy. Enough! -Stella! -[screaming] Let go of me! Stop! [screaming] Stop! [shouts] Stella! Where are your friends? I'll ask them to get you. [Stella] I have no friends. How about relatives? I don't know what to do with you anymore. Where are you going? Von, I've been freeloading here for two weeks now. I should go. But where will you go? I don't know. We'll see. Thanks. Thanks for everything. Don't go! -Hey! Let me out. -I said don't go! -I said let me out! -You're not going anywhere! [Fidel reading in English] "I can write a thousand novels Articulating your majesty But for now, 100 poems Are all I've got for thee" [indistinct chatter] Fidel! [in Tagalog] How are you? What are you doing here? [stammering] Have you seen Stella? Stella? We were supposed to meet, but I can't reach her phone. We no longer see her, right? Danica! Fidel! Wait... What are you doing here? Stella and I were... Were supposed to meet. Why? All right. We're friends anyway. One hundred poems. I've been writing these since first year. You're the first to know in our block. I plan to confess my feelings to Stella... through those. Cool, right? [in English] Oh, my God. [in Tagalog] Why? Oh, my God. Don't you know? She lied to me! She told me she'll tell you. Tell me what? Not here. Come with me. Danica? Are you mad? Yes! At me? No. At Stella! [in English] Okay. She should've told you! You, of all people, deserved to know! Okay, Fidel. Promise me you won't tell anyone. [in Tagalog] Even the people from PAC don't know about this. Not even Stella's former bandmates. [in English] Okay. [in Tagalog] Stella got married in front of a judge. With Von, my cousin. The photocopier guy? When? [in English] Last week. [laughing] [in Tagalog] Oh, Danica. You're a prankster now. What? Is there a hidden camera here? Is this MTV Punk'd? [in English] Fidel, I'm not joking! [in Tagalog] After their wedding, [in English] I had to confront Stella. [in Tagalog] I told her... [in English] "Fidel really likes you in a very meaningful way." [in Tagalog] So much that even I get jealous because I liked you. But that's in the past. I've accepted that it's Stella you like. [in English] I just don't want her to hurt you. Because you don't deserve that. And I told her to at least have the decency to tell you the truth. [breathing heavily] Fidel! How did that happen? When did they meet? How did... Give me... [stammers] Give me one good reason. Why Von? [in English] Because he was there. He was there for Stella, Fidel. [in Tagalog] Me too! [stammering] I was there for her before! I'm here for her even today! How... Try phoning him. Guys, what's the matter? What's up? [sighs] It's from Fidel. You're quitting, Fidel? Why? We're still performing at the Freshies' Orientation. Why quit now? What's the point? The point? [in English] We're all counting on you! You were fine even before, before I became a member. I'm still talking to you! Is this because of Stella? Fidel, your world doesn't have to stop... just because you didn't end up together! Son? Your mom sent you something. I mentioned to her that you graduated. And I got you this. It goes well with your Mom's gift. Wear these on your job interviews. Just leave it there. Not that I'm pressuring you, but since you graduated... It's been five months. When are you planning to look for a job? Hey, Fidel! You're Chuckie's roommate, right? This is Raffy, my boyfriend. What are you doing here? [in English] Job interview. Research firm. [in Tagalog] I'll get some smokes. I thought you quit? You swore on your mother's grave! I love him so much. How's your interview? You know what? I have a solution. Let's go to an audition for a nationwide competition. You sing, I beatbox, like before. I don't know. Come on, Fidel! [in English] You deserve to be heard. And I really think we should go for it. [in Tagalog] I've gotten rusty. Whatever. I'll wait for you. Be there. Ciao! [cell phone ringing] [in English] Hello? [Stella] Fidel? Yes, ma'am. Speaking. [in Tagalog] You haven't changed your number. You busy? I have your poems. [Fidel] I thought they were destroyed. How did you get them? Danica put it back together. Such a hardworking girl. No wonder she's summa cum laude. Have you read them? Yes. I'm amused. I can see the improvement in your writing. The first half is funny. Like you were forcing rhyme. It's wonderful, though. You got better and better. You even wrote in English. But honestly? I don't dig the latter half. Why? Uh... They no longer mirrored the actual events in my life. I used "mirror" in a sentence. Awesome. Look. [in English] Finally. [in Tagalog] We're on the other side of Mt. Arayat. [Fidel] Finally. Too bad the sky is gloomy. You told me back then [stammers] you liked rainy more than sunny days? Listening to music is better when it's raining. That was before. The hundredth poem... Have you read it? It's not here. It's faded. It is. What's the title? I forget. What's the content? What's it about? Can't you recall at least a verse? I really can't remember. Sorry. Time to go. What? I like you. I love you. [stammers] That's the point... of the final poem. Since when? [in English] First year. [in Tagalog] Why tell me now? Because you stutter? You think I wouldn't like you because you stutter? Or is this about your three-word rule? Why, Fidel? How many words do you even need? Huh? [in English] I... Like... You. I... Love... You. [in Tagalog] Why didn't you just say it? Did you love... Did you love me, too, Stella? I still do. Back in third year... when you were willing to let go of that offer, what bar was it again? Tipsy Tarsier. I realized... you were willing to sacrifice for me. What happened? Why did you leave? [stammers] Why did you replace me just like that? [in English] Sorry. [in Tagalog] Tell me. Because... [crying] Because I use every man who pursues me. Barrie, Hunter... You, almost. I don't want to use you. Not you. So I distanced myself. After that, I left home and wandered off. I remember... it was raining then. Von found me. I thought it was you. I wanted it to be you. But it was Von who found me. Don't go! -Hey! Let me out. -I said don't go! -I said let me out! -You're not going anywhere! Why leave? You don't have anywhere to go. Stay here. Let's live together. I know I don't have much. My house is small. My life's simple. But, Stella, I can take care of you. You have nothing. Me, too. Then let's stick together. Let's be partners. I'll drive you crazy. Great! Crazy is fun! [screams] [laughs] [Stella] Because of him... Because of him, I learned how to love without using people. [crying] [crying] Fidel, don't cry like that. Is it... no longer possible... [stammers] for us to end up together? Enough. That's enough. Von and I are married now, Fidel. We're having a baby. You and I are no longer possible. [in English] Sorry. [in Tagalog] Not anymore. This is for you. That's what we performed on Freshies' Night. Come on, it's almost dark. I need to go home. Stella, wait. Damn, it hurts so much. It does. [stammers] You became my world. Shit, I'm so corny. What will I do now? What will I do? Nothing. My world has crumbled. How do I... How do I move on from this? I know you. You can do it. You will move on. You will shine. Forget about me and you will shine bright. I don't deserve to be your world. You can do it. [Stella on tape] Fidel. Sorry it took this long. I'm recording this from my room. Don't expect studio quality. Anyway, this is for the nicest and the smartest person I know. Fine. Cute, too. [singing] See these thousands of people Each with his own path to pave For sure we'll struggle and get scared [phone ringing] [Fidel speaking English] Hello, Chuck? [in Tagalog] Ready to audition? The panelists were all smiles. I think we're in! [stammers] I hope so. I cracked on the last chorus. Yeah, but don't worry. What they're after is potential. [cell phone chiming] What's the matter? Hey! Don't kill yourself. We're not in? [sighs] Oh, well. [stammers] There will be other chances. Let's do better next time. [reading] "Behold, this is a new chapter For someone wiser and stronger Then, a pebble Now, a boulder This world he shall..." [in Tagalog] Sol, sweetie, get my coffee. [in English] I'll just go to the bank first-- Ma'am! Fidel? Fidel! [in Tagalog] How have you been? Sol, sweetheart, this is Fidel, my former student from PAC. Fidel? The one you were telling me about? Uh... Oh, no. What about me? You know, poems and stuff. Wait, the bank is closing. Sol, sweetheart, you go order. -Fidel, I'll leave you two. -Okay, ma'am. [in English] Okay, bye-bye. [in Tagalog] See you. What happened to you and the black lipstick girl? Wow. You know about her. Uh... [stammering] We didn't end up together. That's how it goes, right? You don't end up with the person you want. Is that so? [chuckles] Are you that daughter of Mrs. Barloza-- Who went to rehab? Yup, that's me. Don't worry. I'm fine now. I'm into swimming now. What are you doing? Writing. A poem? Can I see? It's... It's not yet finished. It's ugly. I'm still looking for-- Please? [in English] "Behold, this is a new chapter From someone wiser and stronger Then, a pebble Now, a boulder This world he shall..." [stammers] I haven't thought of a rhyme for "boulder." [in English] "Conquer"! [in Tagalog] Let's try it. [in English] "Then, a pebble Now, a boulder This world he shall conquer" [in Tagalog] I like it. [Fidel speaking English] "Behold, this is a new chapter From someone wiser and stronger Then, a pebble Now, a boulder This world he... We shall conquer"
