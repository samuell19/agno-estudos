Come in. Excuse us. NOVEMBER Please, take your seats. Please, tell me your name, age, and date of birth. I'm Nonomiya Keita. I'm six years old. My birthday is July 28th. Does Keita resemble his father or his mother? He takes after my wife in his calm nature and kindness to others. Does he have any faults? It's the same thing, actually, but he takes things slowly and doesn't seem to mind losing. As his father, it's a little dissatisfying. Keita, what is your favorite season? Summertime. What did you do last summer? I went camping with my father, and we flew kites. Is your father good at flying kites? He's very good. Oh... FUKUYAMA MASAHARU ONO MACHIKO MAKI YOKO RIRI FURANKI Written and Directed by: KORE-EDA HIROKAZU "LIKE FATHER, LIKE SON" Has it changed? They must be making money. New fancy lights on the playing field. Not so loud. I'm back! Did you work hard? Fathers and mothers, that's all for today. Please go home safely. Thank you. Keita... I never took you camping, did I? Why did you say so? My cram school teacher told me to. They sure teach you a lot in cram school. You answered, "An omelet my mother made," correctly, too. - You had fun? - Yes. You made balloons? A cute monster. You made a cute monster? You caught me in the act. You rarely work on Saturdays. I was hoping to leave before you came in. The computer graphics look good. I made them revise it three times. It's all yours. Time for me to get out of your way. I won't be long. We could grab a drink. Sorry, I'm catching a film with my wife. Your good work frees me up to look after my family. Counting on you. Thanks. This is south and this is north, right? Yes, the sun is here. Then, add some families to this park. Walking dogs? Sounds good. Make it feel user friendly. Everyone, our leader is buying us all takeout dinners. Let's see, there's pizza or hot-pot rice... I'm happy to send him to public school, but Ryota thinks he should work hard now, rather than struggle later. The phone's ringing. Bye-bye. It's Daddy. I'll talk to you about Auntie next time. Hello? Is it Daddy? Coming home for dinner? I thought you'd be later. Piano practice? He just finished his exams. I thought today... You've got to be disciplined. Take one day off... And it takes three days to catch up. Okay, Keita. Time for piano. Hang in there. You already ate, right? The bath is ready. Just a slice of pizza. You should have texted me. Got anything? I can make noodle soup. Mimura sent us fresh noodles. That sounds good. Cook the noodles al dente, please. I won't screw them up again. No eggs at night. The cholesterol is too high. Surely I can have one. Right, Keita? Wrong! Why is it wrong? Shall we try that again? I wonder how Mimura is doing on his new job? I'm sure he's fine. The countryside suits him better. You're so cold. You looked after him so much. I can't worry about quitters. I'm sorry I was a quitter. Is he asleep? He was tense and got tired. We've done what we could. The rest is up to Keita. He's working hard. He wants to be like you. Don't you think Keita's grown up recently? You think? Apparently he's been telling Daichi to stop it. I hope so. These days, kindness is a fault. In the interview, you said it was his strength. Please praise him more. We can't both spoil him. Knock, knock. Thanks for taking off work today. Keita was thrilled. I wish I could at least spend Sundays with him. I'll have more time after this project is done. You've been saying that for the last six years. Have I? Yes, you have. Oh, I forgot. Maebashi Hospital called today. Hospital? Where I had Keita. And? They said they wanted to talk to us. What? They'll tell us when they see us. I wonder. I hope it's nothing messy. Switched babies... That only happened back when we were born. Yes. Most of the cases occurred in the late 1960s. We learned from those cases and stopped writing babies' names in Magic Markers on the backs of their feet in 1969. How can this still happen now? So... How is the other couple's son... The blood test to qualify him for elementary school didn't match his parents. Our blood tests match, right? Are you certain? Is Keita really not our child? There were three baby boys in the hospital during that time period. So, after you have an official DNA test, then we will... Two more, two more. KEITA CONGRATULATIONS ON PASSING One more. Together now. Keita, congratulations on passing! Sure. Go ahead. - Great job. - Amazing. The tomato is good. It's good? What a good boy. Open wide. A fried shrimp. Did you get it? You're good, Keita. You're good. Here goes. Good. Want to see? You press this, right? If you push here, it goes back. You're right. You can take another one. If you push here... Very close. Very close. Very close. Very close. Can you open your mouth? "File #1 Nonomiya Ryota and File #2 Nonomiya Midori are not biologically related to File #3 Nonomiya Keita. That is our conclusion.‚Äù So that's how it turned out instead. That's why I asked you if that country hospital was safe. But that's where I was born and all my older siblings. But that's no- You were so busy. I was so lonely I wanted a hospital my mother could easily visit. Why didn't I see it? I'm his mother. Yes, this room please. We're late. I told you to fill the tank yesterday. They're here. I'm sorry to make you wait. She started telling me my sweater was wrong right before we left. Hello. These are the Saikis. Hello. I just don't- This whole thing is such a shock. I'm his wife, Yukari. This is... I'm Nonomiya and my wife, Midori. He's Ryusei. He's Keita. This is from last summer when we went to Sunpia. Don't we have a clearer picture of him? How's this? Where was this? Karasugawa. By Karasu River. You can still catch river salmon and river trout here. These are his- Ryusei's between his siblings, with the water pistol. His birthday? July 28th. The same day. I wonder if we'd met each other, here. After I gave birth, I was sick and had to stay in bed. He was born on such a clear and sunny day. We agreed it was like a sunny day in Okinawa. So we named him Ryusei, choosing the Chinese character for a sunny day. In any event, in these cases, ultimately, 100% of parents choose to exchange. Considering your children's future, you should decide quickly, before elementary school. But that's too sudden. April. That's less than six months away. They're not pets. I couldn't switch a pet either. You're right. No one could switch a pet either. Besides, before you bring that up, don't you have something else to offer? Yes, we're consulting with our lawyer, Orima, here. I can only imagine how horrible you feel, but right now, considering the boys' futures... Shall we meet without them? Yes, we'd like to meet Keita, too. Okay, we'll be in touch. You're late. I'm sorry. Oh, well. How did it go? What were they like? An appliance shopkeeper. A shopkeeper? Come in. Oh, Mother, I forgot to give you this, before. Oh, from the Tiger Sweet Shop. It feels like sweet bean cake. Bingo. Don't get so excited over sweet bean cake, Mom. Insult the sweet bean cake and you'll unleash the tiger. How's Keita? Asleep. We played so much Wii Tennis, I'll be sore tomorrow. I didn't want to say anything at the time, but... When Granny Yamashita, our neighbor, saw Keita, she said, "He doesn't look like either of them." That was... That was two years ago, I think. Ryota, your husband, must be so privileged compared to our family. There are people out there who don't bless your union. A lot of them. I wonder if all that bad energy- Stop it. It didn't happen because some people hate us. Poor you. This area will be redeveloped as Shinjuku Station's west exit. We confidently propose to you The Spiral Tower Shinjuku. What an awful tragedy. I'll make sure it doesn't affect my work. But what are you going to do? Switch back? No, we haven't gotten that far yet. While you're at it, why don't you raise them both? Raise both? Yeah, isn't it a good idea? What's wrong? Don't you want to meet our son? Of course I do. But, at this rate, things will turn out the way the hospital said. Everything will be fine. Leave it to me. I'm sorry, sorry. Right before we left, she found things to do. Hello. I'm Saiki Ryusei. I'm Yamato. I'm Miyu. Hey, introduce yourself. Hello. I'm Nonomiya Keita. Hello there. Thanks for waiting. Here are your drinks. Here's the ticket for your food. Hey, Ryu. I splurged a little. That will be 6,030 yen. Oh, no. - I'll get this. - Let me pay. A receipt. To Maebashi Central General Hospital. Oh, wait, add this too. Sure, thank you. You eat so much. You just ate 2 meters' worth of French fries. I'm finished. Want to go play? I want to play, too. Go ahead. Miyu, take Yamato with you. Ryu, watch them both. Children are so quick. I wonder how much they'll pay us in damages. What matters isn't the money but finding out how this happened. Of course it is. Of course, I'm-- But, you know, the only way they can show their good faith is with damages. That's right. That's how it is. Do you happen to know a lawyer? In that case, let me handle this issue. A former classmate is a lawyer. Please ask him, then. Hey! I'll go call him. My neck hurts. Oh, my God! He doesn't look like us. Just him. A blunt friend accused me of having an affair. I thought she was so cruel... But I never... Keita, bye-bye! See you again! What? From Yukari. She says, "You can count on me." Bye-bye! Bye-bye! "You can count on me"? How arrogant of her. Get it together. We may have to fight them. Fight them? Sorry, I had an emergency press conference. Thanks. I know you're busy. I've been negotiating as planned. It's not so much the money but how this happened. Their lawyer is a country bumpkin. He's probably used to bankruptcies. He doesn't understand. I really appreciate it. Do you mind? I'm not here to talk about the lawsuit. I'd like to find some way to take custody of both boys. That's a wild idea. Can you become the father of their boy? I'd like him to live with us. He's got my blood, after all. Your blood? That's an old-fashioned idea. It's not old or new. That's being a father. Now, that's old-fashioned. You always had a father issue. That's enough of that. Take a look at this. In England, if the state determines the parents unfit to raise their children, the children are raised in an institution. That's if they're drug addicts or the mother uses the house to prostitute herself. The mother's quick to scream, and the father lies around doing nothing. That's hardly enough. You can't call that neglect. Parental rights win out. But we can pay a lot of money to adopt, as long as they agree. They'll never agree. But I can propose the plan at the right moment. You're as pushy as ever. As your lawyer, I wish you'd join forces with them to fight the lawsuit. JANUARY What do you think? This is your fourth meeting. Can you take the step of sleeping over? Children adapt quickly to new things. We're willing to consider taking that step, but the settlement is a different matter. Yes, of course. What do you say, Saiki-san? Yes, well... Meeting like this is kind of fun, but-right? You say we should take steps. Is there a manual for this situation? That's a good point. I'm not sure I like this. It might work out fine. They have your blood, after all. Once you experience that, your current feelings will- We have to consider Yamato and Miyu. I don't want to rush things. That's right, we don't want to rush. And you, Nonomiya-san? I suggest we try it out on weekends. Spend one night on Saturdays. The grown-ups are talking. Go away. Keita, do you like playing piano? You don't have to if you don't want to. But Daddy said I'm good. Shall we keep at it? There's your recital, too. Keep at it! Oh, no, I'm hopeless. I did it! I did it! Keita can eat soba noodles. I don't feed him raw fish yet. Listen, Keita, tomorrow, we're leaving here at 10:00 in the morning. And then- It's white. And then, you stay over at Ryusei's house tomorrow. - Okay? - Yeah. It's like a mission for you to get stronger. You know a mission? Really? It's part of a strategy for you to get stronger and grow up. Oh, man, oh, man. This is pathetic. - Hello. - Hello. Please, look after him. Ryusei, get in the back, please. Oh, my God. "Chuji"? Say, did you know that Spider-Man is actually a spider? Hey, man, it's cold. Hey, how are you? I'm fine, fine. I came to replace the bathroom light. The bathroom? So, a 60-watt should do. Close the door. It's cold. You want an LED? I can't pee if it's that bright. In that case, a 40-watt. 190 yen. Are you free next Sunday? 6:00 am.? Still playing baseball? You've still got it at your age? We'll let you pitch. I'm over the hill. My shoulder's an old man, see? You're still so young. You can do it. Thanks. Dumplings? Yes, dumplings. Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten. Eleven, twelve. That sound smells good. Thirteen, fourteen, fifteen. That sound smells good. Here you go. Okay, let's all eat. I'm hungry. Good, good. Hurry up, or there won't be any left. Super hot and tasty. Only one egg for Daddy. Let me eat as many eggs with sukiyaki as I want. Is it tasty? The meat's still too hot to eat. Lower the heat. It's good. - Oh, good. - Tasty? Ryusei. About holding your chopsticks. Like this? You see... Watch how I hold them. You move it like this. Yes, try it. Keita. Will you put this on the altar? Wake up! Can I ring the bell? Sure. Good morning. You did that before, Keita? At Grandma's house. Grandma's? Okay, everybody. Good morning. Grandma, this is Keita. Please say hello to him. Stay back. It's hot. It's smoking. I think it's fixed. Batteries for the toy car. Wow! Which one? That's the Skytree. Oh, my God. That's it, that's right. What time is it? It's 2:45. Want to go home? Home? Yes, go home. I'm home. Welcome home. - Were you good? - Yeah. Sorry to make you come so far. Not at all. This is my hometown. Where's Ryota? He had an important meeting. He's sure to work. I wish my husband did. My motto is, "Put off to tomorrow whatever you can." Right, your life will be over before you know it. Trying to scare me. I've still got some life left to live. Say, what's this? That happened at the park. I ran, and I fell. He bled a little, but it stopped. You bled a little. Did it hurt? So everybody gets in the bath together? It's small. It's about half of ours. What's Ryusei's mommy like? I was scared at first, but she's kind. I see. Keita... Shall the two of us run away somewhere? Where's somewhere? Far away. Where's far away? Somewhere nobody knows. What about Daddy? Well, Daddy... Daddy has his work. Hey, Ryusei! Yamato! I caught you. It's still wet. Come this way. Over here to dry. It's not wet. Yes, it is. It's not wet. It's still wet in the back. Turn this way. Not my face. Over here. Okay, let's all sleep together. They get him hurt and can't even bother to apologize. Then you should have come with me. No point scolding me now. We'll Band-Aid it. At Ryusei's house, they call it a bandage. All done. Say good night to Daddy. Good night. Good night. Was the party a success? Yeah. Kaoru found a boyfriend at college. The manager was disappointed. Were they talking about me? Like I should have known better as a mother. Not really. Deep down, that's what you think. - No, I don't. - Liar. You think it's all my fault. When do I go back to Ryusei's house? Next Saturday. Can I take this? Sure. He's great. He can fix anything. That's great. Then let's ask him to fix that broken heater too. Mother, do you want to stay over? APRIL I've got knitting class tomorrow. I should go home. Besides, this place feels like a hotel. I can't feel at home. During the war, lots of children were adopted and fostered. It's who raises you that matters most. I haven't decided to, yet. But then, that's what meeting with them means. The two of us talk it over and make our own decisions. Oh, excuse me. An old woman butting into your business. Oh, not at all. Your opinion is precious. Thank you. All ready. You look as handsome as a prince. I'll take a picture. Good morning. I'm here. Saiki-san. Oh, hello. They said they'd pay for the bullet train fare. Come in. This is for you. Oh, thank you. This is your place. It is like a hotel, just like Ryusei said. Hey, hey, Keita. You're so good-looking. You must be the prince of some country. Nice to meet you. I'm Keita's... You're his grandmother. You're so young. Flattery will get you exactly nothing. Then I shouldn't have bothered. Shall 17?7? I'm fine. Say, what's that, Keita? Show me. A pretty flower petal. I'll film you. No, no, I'll just film myself like this. Tsuyuki Mao. - Tsuyuki Mao. - Yes. Nonomiya Keita. Yes. It's a real mystery. I saw Keita's face and named him Ryusei, right? But by now, his face looks like a Keita. Nonomiya-san. Ryota. Ryo, Ryo. It's your turn! Time for your turn! Ouch, ouch. Man, I've had it. Wiped out. I should have made it before I turned 40. I'm too old for it. You're younger than me, Ryota. You should make more time to be with your child. There's room for all kinds of families. You don't even bathe together? The policy in our house is for him to be independent. If that's your policy, that's the way it is. But it's worth investing the time. I've spent more time with Keita these past six months than you have. It's about a lot more than time. What are you saying? For children, it's all about time. There are certain jobs only I can do. But no one can take your place as your son's father. Hey, Ryusei. We're leaving. It's like they're brothers. An order of pork cutlet curry to take out, please. Please wait a moment. Her father's waiting at home, hungry. Make that five kids. I can't look after all of them. You mean me? In that case, can we take care of both of them? Both of them? Keita and Ryusei. Are you serious? Yes. Is it impossible? I can't believe it. You're insulting us. When you think about their future happiness- You mean ours are unhappy? I have plenty of money to offer. There are things money can buy and things you can't. You're trying to buy a child with money? You said before that good faith is about money. I'm sorry, he doesn't know what he's saying. And the children are watching. Your takeout order is ready. You've never lost at anything. You can't understand how other people feel. What are you going to do? You brought it up there, like it was a joke. I can't believe it. No wonder they're mad. Will you please shut up? I'm thinking. We were just getting friendly again. Why do I have to put up with that kind of talk from a shopkeeper? There you go again. Welcome back. - Caf√© au lait for you. - Thank you. Black for Daddy. Thanks. Your change, Mommy. Thank you. Now! Here it is! You hit it. Again. Good, good! You hit it outside the line, Keita. That's no good. You have to hit it in the middle. Do you remember a nurse named Miyazaki? No. Probably if I saw her face. What's she going to say? I assume the hospital wants to prove that their staff's working conditions were in order. She started ironing just before we left. Please, no stupid jokes now. I apologize about the other day. Right. Oh, no, it was our... I hereby swear to tell the truth, according to my conscience, without concealing anything and without deception. Saiki Yukari. Nonomiya Midori. Miyazaki Shoko. Even if the hospital did make an error, shouldn't you have been able to tell? You are his mother. Under healthy conditions, yes. But after giving birth, I lost a lot of blood. I was barely conscious for several days after. Will you be able to exchange the boys without any trouble? I don't know. Even if we do exchange them, there's no guarantee it will work out. The burden on our family is not temporary. Our suffering will continue long into the future. Please tell me about your working conditions then. Did you have to work the night shift consecutively? No. Compared to other hospitals, the shifts were easy. Then why do you think this accident happened? It wasn't an accident. "It wasn't an accident.‚Äù What do you mean by that? The Nonomiya family seemed so happy. I did it on purpose. I had just remarried and was struggling to raise his children. I took out my frustration on someone else's babies. The Nonomiyas were staying in the most expensive hospital room. I heard from his wife that her husband worked for a major firm. She had a loving family nearby. Compared to her... What were your feelings at the time? Honestly, at the time, I felt relieved, that I wasn't the only one miserable. Why now? What made you decide to confess? My husband's children love me now. And that makes what I did seem so monstrous now. I want to pay for my crime. I deeply apologize to you. I am so sorry. I can't believe she took out her parenting frustrations on us. She knew her new husband had kids when she remarried. She was relieved. She thinks it was like shoplifting. She doesn't understand the gravity of her crime. She says she's happy now. How selfish can she be? But, actually, the hospital will have to pay a lot more damages. Of course they will. Please ask Mr. Suzumoto about that. Yes. She is going to prison, right? Of course she is. For five or ten years? That's still too short. Actually, the statute of limitations expired. Expired? Suzumoto told me the crime would be "kidnapping a minor," but the statute expires after five years. After what she did, she apologizes and it's over? That's ridiculous! Not so loud. I can't possibly accept that. We will continue to suffer forever, but that woman gets off. That woman knew the statute had expired, so she confessed. I'm sure of it. I'll never forgive her. I'll never, ever. JUNE Like this? Oh, look. Megumi is making this thorn. Isn't she good? He'd been taking his blood pressure medication. Is this his second one? His third. Thank goodness Nobuko-san was there. Can't you call her "Mother," at least when you see her? Oh, I don't? Imagine, Dad so weakened he wants to see his sons. It's for the best. He needs to weaken a little. When he sees your roses, he'll burst into tears. Here's your change. Thank you for your order. Thank you. This is the only restaurant nearby. Are you all recovered from your illness? Otherwise, you wouldn't visit. I told you last time, I can't give you more money. I have money. I'm working as a building superintendent in Minowa. And she's working part-time. Can't you stop betting on stocks? Don't, Ryota. You love salmon caviar, right? Eat your fill. I'd love to eat my fill. But I've been told to hold back on purine-rich foods. But today's special. Why are eggs so tasty? How was the Derby race? Your face says you lost big. You bet on the wrong man, Mother, having to suffer so much. You bet on the wrong horse. I don't have gambling smarts either. Then I guess I took after you. Oh, well, that's a married life. Don't work so hard for him. It's like you're his home care nurse. If I'm your nurse, you should pay me 1,000 yen an hour. That's more than I get paid. She's been playing for three years, but all she plays is Gentle Flower. I can hardly take a nap. They can hear you. I want them to hear me. So did you meet him? Your son, your real son. Yes, we did. Did he look like you? I bet he did. That's what family is. They look like you, even if you live apart. Please spare us that, Dad. Right? Listen... It's in the blood. For humans and horses, it's all about bloodlines. Their boy is going to look more and more like you. And Keita will increasingly resemble the boy's father. Hurry up, exchange the kids, and never see that family again. It's not that simple. It's slippery, be careful. I can see that. Man, you're a pain. Are you my wife? I'm trying to be nice. Keep that up, and you'll lose friends. He already has. Despite what your father says, if you live together, you don't have to be related. You start to love each other and look like each other. It's true of married couples. And it's probably true for parents and their children. In any case, that's how I felt, raising you boys. Please come again. Tell Manami I'll come see her quilts again. Please come. See you. Next time, bring booze, not flowers. I'm glad your father's okay. He tricked me good. I had to take off for good. Did he say anything about Keita? Not really. Keita, Daddy's home. Welcome home. I'm home. For Father's Day, at school. Keita, thank you. I'm giving the other one to Ryusei's daddy because he fixed my robot. Oh, I see. You really are kind, aren't you? Can't we just keep things as they are? Pretend none of it ever happened. With every passing day, Keita will increasingly grow to resemble your family. And Ryusei... will grow to resemble us. Can you really love a child without your blood the way you did before? Of course I can. The only reason you care so much about whether he resembles you or not is because you're a man who feels no real connection to his child. The longer we postpone it, the more painful it will be. For us... and the boys. Keita, you look after them. Okay, I'm off now. Off you go! Your bento is ready. That's 400 yen. Keita, you get an extra piece of fried chicken. Take care, going home. When summer comes, we'll have fireworks here, swim in the pool, and crack watermelons open. You, too, Keita. That's funny. I'm home. Oh, he came home. Yeah, you were a big help. Thank you. Let's talk again. Welcome home. Where's Ryusei? Taking a bath. I didn't realize how late it is. Sorry I leave him up to you. I managed to free up tomorrow. It's always been this way. I'm fine. Who were you talking to? To Yukari. She said Yudai wants to open a surf shop after he turns 50. But actually he can't surf. You shouldn't get too close to her. As mothers, we need to share. Not that you would understand. She's amazing. Yes, she is. How can you stand it? If you don't have the will to play better, you should quit. Not everyone can work as hard as you. Sounds like working hard is bad. Some people can't work hard even if they want to. I think Keita takes after me. Is he asleep? I did what you told me to, but you're going to let Keita go. You told me you'd take care of it. Liar. I didn't expect it would turn out like this. You had your mind made up from the start. That you'd choose blood over our six years with Keita. That's not true. Do you... When we found out Keita wasn't our son, remember what you said? Yeah, I remember. Why couldn't you see it? I apologize about that. No! That's not it. This is what you said. "Now it all makes sense.‚Äù "Now it all makes sense.‚Äù What "makes sense" now? You never could believe that Keita isn't as gifted as you! I'll never, ever forget what you said that day. Here goes. You're doing great. Amazing. Ready? Here goes. Can I use it? From this side. I'll give you that camera. Why not? Don't you want it? No, I don't. I see. Listen, Keita. When you move into their house, you call Auntie and Uncle "Mommy" and "Daddy." If you get lonely, you can't call us. Promise. It's a mission? Yes, a mission. When will I reach my goal? It's not clear. Keita. You probably wonder why you have to do this mission. But in ten years, I'm sure you'll understand. Do I play piano at Ryusei's house? Whatever you want. If you want to keep playing, you should. I'll ask them for you. You can't fly kites here. They're protecting the Ayu fish. They have lines everywhere to keep the birds away. Hey! Stop it! Ryusei! Back in our day... Actually, I'm a little older than you, but... My dad made kites with bamboo sticks and thin white paper. And the kite streamers were made from strips of newspaper. These days kites fly so easily, it's no fun. Back then, it was hard to get them to fly. My father wasn't the type to fly kites with his children. But you don't have to be like your father. Please fly kites with Ryusei. Yes. A train is passing! A train is passing! He doesn't look it, but he scares easily. He was too scared to go to the bathroom at night. I always had to go with him. But after Yamato was born, he became his older brother. He promised that after Yamato is toilet trained, he'll take him to the bathroom. Keita always said he wanted a brother. But I can't have any more children. So I'm sure he'll be happy to get a brother and sister, even in this way. Keita... When you move to their house, you don't need to worry about anything. Ryusei's mommy and daddy both love you so much. More than you, Daddy? More than me. Shall we all take a picture together? Yes. Come. Are we ready? Stand still now. Smile. Let's all smile together. Hey! Here goes! One, two, and three! What's so funny? - Nothing's funny. - Nothing's funny. "I don't chew straws." "I study English every day." "I sit down when I go to the bathroom." "I take baths quietly, by myself." "Only 30 minutes of TV games a day." "Call you Daddy and Mommy." Why? You're not Daddy. You're not Daddy. From now on, I'm your Daddy. Why? Doesn't matter. Why? And... They... Let's do this. Daddy and Mommy live over there, like before. Can you call us Father and Mother? Why? It doesn't matter. Why doesn't it matter? You'll understand someday. Why? It doesn't matter. It doesn't matter? Why? I wonder why. Why? Let's brush your teeth. Here. Say, what's wrong? Is it broken? I'll fix it for you. Is it here? Is it here or here? Is it fixed? AUGUST Engineering department in Utsunomiya? Yes. Why me? Nohara can handle that. Yeah, well... But you've got your trial to deal with. Don't get me wrong. It's not like I'm being sued. Of course I know that. It's just, you've always kept your foot on the gas pedal, right? It's about time for you to brake. But you got this far because you kept going. That was a different time. Try spending a little time with your family. There are blue and red ramen lids. Which do you prefer? I prefer red. Red is soy sauce. No? I don't know. Hello? Daddy's not home yet, so this will be our secret. Why did you draw this picture? You made Mother cry. Did you tell her you're sorry? That's all. Go to sleep. Can you say good night? Good night. DADDY, MOMMY You're making noise. Be quiet. I said stop it! This... It doesn't work. Have your mother buy you a new one. When I go home again, I'll have Daddy fix it. Ryusei. You're not going back to that house. You're going to live here from now on. I'm your real daddy. Let me see that. I came to tell you, you won. But you don't look very happy. I am not winning. In lawsuits, no one ends up a clear winner. That's not what I'm talking about. It doesn't sound like you, but I could get around to liking you. I don't want you to love me. You want someone to love you? Sounds less and less like you. Oh, I almost forgot. This. From that nurse. In addition to the hospital's damages. It's all the good faith she can afford. Good evening. Good evening. I'm returning this, your good faith. I'm sorry. Because of you, my family is destroyed. Teru... You're not involved. I am involved. She's my mother. Hello, Nonomiya here. It's Ryota. Oh, Ryo. Thanks for the other day. Listen. Shall I get your father? No. I wanted to apologize. Oh, no, nothing serious. Back when-- I don't want to go back. I've forgotten it all. I want to talk with you about silly things, like who's wearing a wig and who's had plastic surgery. I agree. That's your father saying he's run out of his drink. Okay. I understand. We use much less water on the Green Roof project now that we repurpose rainwater. If you total all the water used to water the plants and the moat, it's about 42.6 cubic meters. I started out as an architect, just like you. This is a man-made forest, created for research. Was this... Born here? Yes. It's easy enough for insects to fly here from elsewhere. But for the cicadas to lay eggs here and their larva to crawl from the earth and emerge from a pupa, it took 15 years. That long? Is that long? Hello. Excuse me, Nonomiya here. Sorry I'm late. Oh, hello. Apparently he decided he wanted to fly a kite. Fly a kite? He made it through the station with some grown-up. He's awfully clever about that sort of thing. Don't praise him for that. You should discipline him. Should we have sent him away with an empty stomach? We could never do that. I can understand that. If it's not working out, you can send him back for a while. Yes, we're perfectly happy to take Keita and Ryusei, both. We'll be fine. I'll make sure of it. Ryusei! Ryusei, we're going home! You can take your time calling us Father and Mother. Take your bath and don't play. Keita. Touching him like this, he feels... Like you. I ran away from home, too. I wanted to see my mother. My father dragged me right back home. Next is Father! Oh, my God. Ryu! Ryu! Are you okay? Father! Are you okay? Father, are you okay? Cut it out. Watch out. You're still winning. I win. Find it? Okay? Here's the smallest one. Ready and... here goes. You caught your father. Cancer, Scorpio, Gemini. Sagittarius. Libra. Aquarius. Virgo. A falling star. Make a wish. What did you wish for? I want to go where Daddy and Mommy are. Ryu... I'm sorry. It's all right. It's all right. What is it? I've started loving Ryusei. Then, why... Because... I feel so bad for Keita. I feel like I'm betraying him. I wonder how Keita's... What about breakfast? Shall we eat? Welcome. Light bulbs? How many watts? - I'm home. - Welcome home. Ryu, what's up? Keita. - Keita! - Keita! Keita. I'm sorry. Daddy... Just had to see you. I broke my own rule to come see you. Daddy is not my daddy. You're right. But, you know, for six years... I was your daddy for six years. I wasn't a very good daddy, but I was your daddy. Your rose. I'm sorry I lost it. I'm sorry. The camera... You had taken so many pictures of me. The piano. I quit piano partway, too. You know... That mission is over now! They're back. Welcome home. Come in. Sure. Let's go in. Okay, let's go in. Did you know that Spider-Man is actually a spider? No, I never knew that.
