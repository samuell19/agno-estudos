[♪♪♪♪♪] THERESA: Yes, Jenny, this is how you can spell it, yes. Thank you. Hey, Daddy! Hey. How's my big girl, huh? [CHUCKLES] -Let me down, let me down. -All right, all right. Go get her. Sorry I'm late. -Mr. and Mrs. O'Meara. -Russo. I beg your pardon? I'm O'Meara, she's Russo. We're divorced. I know this is probably nothing but it sets a bad example for the other kids. Jenny was making some pretend cocktails for some of her classmates, and they were acting, you know, tipsy. I own a neighborhood bar. Jenny's precocious, but I can assure you... I asked her where she learned it. She said from her mother's friend, Bobby. [CAR HORN BLARES] -Hi. How you doing? -Yeah. -Thanks for stopping by. -Hey, man. -WOMAN: Hi, Jimmy. -MAN: Hey, Jimmy. John, how you doing? You okay? Yeah. Great. Congratulations, Lou. Inspector Louise Robbins. Who'da thunk it? I'm proud of you. -Mick? -MICK: Yup. -Lou's my guest tonight. -Oh, Jimmy, thanks. GINA: Jimmy, Jimmy, Jimmy. Uh, Vinnie wants to run another tab. He's already into you for, like, a C-note. Well, tell him he's gotta pay the old tab before starts a new one. -He's your lawyer, you tell him. -He handled my divorce, -that makes him my lawyer? -Thanks. Hey, Vinnie, what's the matter? Hey, Jimmy, things a little tied. You know, I was coming on a budget but I've got a check in next, I'll take care of everything. -I swear to God. -Aye, that's fine. Hey, Mick, it's fine. Don't worry about it. -Thank you, Jimmy. -Okay. Oh, did I tell ya? Saw Theresa in here last night. -When? -Oh, about 11:00. -She was looking good, man. -Was she looking for me? Didn't say, she cruised right through. Didn't stay long. She, uh, still living with that dirtbag, DeSantos? Hey, Mick, you got something you wanna tell me, tell me. -Word is, he dabbles, man. -What? He deals. No coke. Jimmy, what century are you living in? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Another night in the bar business. MAN: Come on, man, it's my turn now. MAN 2: Hey, look, let me tell you something. MAN: Hey, let me tell you something, pal, you've been on this machine all night. Ho-ho-ho-ho-ho-ho! Guys. GINA: There's no need for that. Everybody could have a turn. All right, all right, look, come on, here. Mick, some black coffee, okay? MICK: Coming up. Now you keep behaving like this, no more pinball for you. [BELL DINGING] Doesn't matter what the word on the street is, Jimmy, okay? You work in a bar. She works in a brokerage house. -She's a part-time secretary. -It doesn't matter. No judge is gonna reverse custody. I don't want my daughter growing up in that kind of environment, Vinnie. Uh, Jimmy, Vincent, okay? Vincent, we're not in your bar. Fine. Vincent. If she violates the agreement we hashed out, you've got a leg to standby. Otherwise, zippo. [♪♪♪♪♪] THERESA: You busy? Hi, Theresa. You're looking good. Thanks. [SIGHS] I need money. A loan. I heard your boyfriend's dealing. That's not true. Get it from him. It's for Jenny. I wanna get something special for her birthday. Bobby is not her father, you are! You don't know how hard it is for me to come to you. Oh, Theresa, hold on, hold on, hold on. Don't do that, come on. I'm sorry. Now, don't worry about the money. You know I wouldn't ask. Thanks, Jimmy. We're done cleaning up. You wanna join me and Mick for some breakfast? Like the old days? I'm buying. In the old days, I bought. No, you go ahead, I gotta see, uh, Jenny tomorrow. -So I'll lock up. -Mm-hmm. -JIMMY: Oh, Gina? -Change your mind? No. I wrote Theresa a check tonight. She said it was for Jenny. You think I did the right thing? Heart of gold. Yeah, yeah, you did the right thing. Ciao. She's got a slight ear infection. She's gonna need these drops. Come on, Jenny. You keepin' your father waiting. Give me a kiss. Come on, let's go. Did you go to church today? JENNY: Mommy took me. But Bobby didn't go. -He never goes anymore. -In the car, hotshot. Where are we going? Your favorite place. Buckle up. You like my new doll? Rose. You named her after Grandma. She'll like that. She's got a big butt like Grandma. What's the matter, Daddy? Oh, nothing, honey. Hey, don't say anything about grandma's big butt, okay? [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -Hey, Lou. -Hey. Is this kid a champ or what? I need to talk to you. Come on. Let's see what you can do. All I know is the feds are gonna bust your ex-wife's old man. Jimmy, he's goin' to jail. And what can I do? Well, it's none of my business, but friend to friend? When it does go down, if somebody gets a little crazy, your little girl could get hurt. Now if I were you, I would keep Jenny away from their house. -Thanks, Lou. -Okay. Oh, you didn't hear this from me. Lamb Stew for my favorite granddaughter. I'm your only granddaughter. You'd be my favorite even if I had a hundred. Okay, let's go. Time for ear drops and a bath. Aw. I don't wanna take a bath. -I'm staying? -Yup. I told your mother I'd take you to school in the morning. Jimmy.

What about Bobby? Do you like Bobby? He could live with us, too, he could be my uncle. Go to sleep, sweetheart. -Say it. Say it. -Say what? Sleep with angels. [BABY CRYING] Bastard. My boyfriend didn't come home last night. I told him the next time, -I will not be sleeping and-- -[TELEPHONE RINGING] Hello? -Hello? -Hi, honey. Where are you? I'm with some friends. Don't worry about me. I won't be coming home tonight. Just a second. Andrea, please. I gotta-- Okay, sure, I understand. Oh, and don't let him tell you he's out with the guys and forgot to call. Don't you give me friends. Where are you? I was so worried. -I got arrested. -THERESA: Oh, no. Theresa? Not a word. Bobby. JIMMY: Okay. All right, just sit her here, Mick. I'm still painting the bedroom. Oh, hard, I gotta go, I'm late. Thanks a lot. Look, Ma, what do you think? It's a garage sale special. A little paint. Voila, antique. You can't keep her here like this, Jimmy. You'll get in trouble with the courts. To hell with the courts. She's not in school. Where is she? It'll be all right, Mom. She's not here. -Where is she? -Safe. -Safe? -What are you doing? What are you... come here. Sit down, sit down. You want me to beg? -I'll beg. -He's a drug dealer. How could you put her in that kinda jeopardy? For the tenth time, I did not know. You have to believe me. Were you living off his inheritance? 'Cause he didn't have a job? He's in jail, okay? He's not coming back. Jimmy, I made a mistake. But I'm good to her, you know that. I swear to God, if you don't give her back, -I'll die. -[JENNY LAUGHING] I don't know about this kid here... Mommy! [♪♪♪♪♪] You guys see today's paper? Old DeSantos must be singing like a tenor. Now they nailed three more jamokes this week. Police sweep off local crime family, news at 11:00. Mick, hand me the phone, will you? Want me to dial it? I know Theresa's number by heart already. Cut her a break, Jimmy. You called her every night this week. She's up. Part of our deal. She wants Jenny back, she suffers my paranoia. Mick, what time do you have? It's almost 11:00. [BUZZING] Jimmy? -You're Theresa's ex? -Yeah. Right. Hi. I'm Andrea. -I'm her neighbor, 1C. -Oh, how you doing? -Okay. -Uh, listen, um, where is she? I don't know, try her job? Yeah, I did. -Wanna do me a favor? -Sure. Go. GINA: Jimmy? I've called every hospital, every emergency room. No Russo, no Jenny, nobody under DeSantos. You know, I started out mad, now I'm starting to get a feeling. My mother used to have with us kids before something bad was gonna happen. The day my brother got killed by that car, she knew. Oh, come on, Jimmy. You're getting morose. Now, look, there's probably some simple explanation for all of this. I had my little girl right in my hands, Gina, right in my hands, and I let her go. -So frustrating! -Hey, Jimmy! -MR. RUSSO: Who is it? -It's Jimmy, Mr. Russo. -I wanna talk to you. -MR. RUSSO: Go away. I'm not going away so open up! You know, some people like to sleep in this world. Yeah, I know, I'm sorry, Mr. Russo. Have you heard from Theresa? You know, not for nothing, Jimmy, but, uh, you two ain't together no more. She says it wasn't your fault, okay. But I'm from the old school. Mr. Russo, the quicker you answer my question, the quicker you're gonna get back to sleep. She went outta town, with Bobby. That's impossible, he's in jail. I don't think so. He's too smart for that. He, uh, had a chance for a job's, -what she said. -Where did they go? I don't know. When are they coming back? What do I look like? Some kind of a oracle? Huh? The weekend, she said, okay? Enough with twenty questions. [DOGS BARKING] When you ask a favor, you really ask it, don't you? All I know is DeSantos was popped. Charges long as my arm, the Feds turned him. Newspapers should have told you that. He didn't even spend the night in jail. I can't believe they let that bum out on the streets. Why not? There's nobody left for him to rat on. They picked up Rodriguez this morning after he wrapped his car around a telephone pole. Was... was that a Red two-door? Now you're messing with my pension, Jimmy. Uh-uh, that's the best I can do. Good luck. Thanks, Lou. You know, thinking like that calls for lubrication, my man. You know, I'm thinking about selling this place. Doing something more normal. Oh, yeah, and water runs uphill. Come on, Jimmy, this place is your dream, man. Another couple of years, you're over the hump. This place cost me my marriage, my family. Wasn't the bar that cost you Theresa. She had a roving eye. You know, Jimmy, what you need is a relationship, man. Your unused hormones are beginning to Pac-Man your brain cells. You wanna know what I want outta life? -To catch the brass ring. -To catch the brass ring. Hey, Jimmy, how's your kid? She's good, I'll see her tomorrow. Oh, great, come on, have a shot with me, Mick. I don't wanna do a shot with you, Vinnie. -Come on. -Nah. I don't wanna drink with lawyers. -I don't trust lawyers. -Come on. Come on, Theresa, don't do this to me now, be there. GINA: I know you, what, ten years, Jimmy. I don't mean to nag, but you're losing your grip. I mean, there are certain things I can't do for the club. -Like sign payroll-- -I pay you to nag me. That's what a manager does. Jimmy, listen to me. I got a friend, comes into the bar, -name's Liz Gallagher. -I've seen her. She's a private investigator. -Oh, I didn't know what she did. -I'll introduce. Listen to me she tracks down guys who don't pay child support. She's really good. She can help you find Jenny. -[♪♪♪♪♪♪] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] [PHONE RINGING] Dammit, Theresa! What's going on? MAN: Hey, fella, give it a rest! -Theresa! -MAN: I'm calling the cops! [INDISTINCT CHATTER] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Yeah. -JIMMY: It's Jimmy. Jenny and Theresa have gone, disappeared. Now, you gotta do something. Jimmy, you gotta call the cops. This is a missing persons matter. I'm a lawyer, Jimmy. Call the cops. Look, I, um, I don't mean to summarize such important events so casually, but I have to ask some tough questions if you want me to help get your daughter back. It's just hard to talk about it. We got married in college. First couple of years, I worked two jobs, made some investments, you know, enough to get my business. After that, I was married to it. Then, uh... well, she thought it was her fault. I thought it was mine. Does that make it an amicable divorce? Um, this Bobby DeSantos character, he the one she's having the affair with? Mm-hmm. LIZ: He ever violent with Theresa? I don't think so. And, uh, what was his line of work? Lately, I heard he's been dealing drugs. Did, uh, did Theresa use? No. No, she's a good mother. Listen, I want you to understand something. My daughter is the most important thing in the world to me. So I will be an active participant. So I hope you don't mind having a partner. As long as you understand I don't split fees. Right. Uh, do me a favor and just wait out here. We had an agreement. You know what I do for a living. I chase child support deadbeats. Now, the staff in there is all women. They sympathize with the people I usually represent, other women they, they let me see things I ordinarily have no right to. -So if you come in, then-- -All right. All right. -Do what you have to. -DeSantos' vitals. DeSantos is older than he says he is. His salary that he earned during one, two-year period averaged a dollar 32 an hour. a dollar 32 an hour? Prison wages. Also he hasn't paid FICA for three years. That's the time he's been with Theresa. Do you think she knew he was dealing? No, I don't think so. No. So, do you like what you do? I'm not, um, a radical feminist. If that's what you mean, I've... I've tracked a few women who reneged on their support payments, too. But, yeah, yeah, I do like it. I mean, somebody has to help these people. And don't make it obvious, but do you know those two men in suits sitting by the window? [INDISTINCT TV CHATTER] I've never seen them. -Hey, Mick. -MICK: Yeah? Those guys sitting by the window, what are they drinking? Club soda. Pam-pam-pam-pam. -Getting close. -Cops? Not local. The Feds? I'll pick you up in the morning. You're impressed with my friend, aren't you? Get out of here. [HORN HONKS] I figured since DeSantos got busted, he needed a lawyer. And if those suits in your bar weren't locals, and they weren't, can only mean one thing. Mr. O'Meara, FBI. We'd like you to come with us. We were going to see their boss, anyway. My attorney's name is Vincent Infante. Tell him what's going on. JIMMY: I think I should have my lawyer in here. You're not in any trouble, Jimmy. Then why was I dragged in front of a US attorney? -Look, Mr. Van Zandt-- -Jimmy. I apologize for the method I used to get you here. I hope I didn't cause you any embarrassment. No, I don't mean to be disrespectful. But can we cut to the chase? I'm afraid you walked into the middle of a very important case for us. Send in Mr. Scranton, please. DeSantos decided to work with us rather than be a stand-up guy and spend the rest of his life in prison. This is Darrell Scranton of the US Marshall's office. -Mr. O'Meara. -How you doing? Look, you see, I don't care about DeSantos. I just wanna find my daughter. This isn't easy, Jimmy. I have a child myself. Where is Jenny? -Unfortunately, we can't say. -What do you mean you can't say? It's true, Jimmy. At least for the time being. We can arrange for you to talk to her, by phone. Look, Jimmy. Work with us. Help us put those creeps away. We can't do it alone. I realize it's a sacrifice. But with the help of people like you, we can get the job done. I've been here for two hours. Jimmy, I got other clients. What's going on? You know where my daughter is? These federal guys on the top floor got her. They got her in the Witness Protection Program. I let them con me into keeping her. It's good to sacrifice, see the larger picture, the blah, blah, blah. -Come on. -Where? I can't go along with this. Jimmy, I don't know anything about this sort of case. Vinnie, you're an attorney, for God's sake, act like one. JIMMY: You're smooth, Mr. Van Zandt. I have to give you that. I thought we agreed to handle this in a friendly manner? No, deal's off. You know that old saying, keep your friends close, but you enemies closer? You guys hosed me. DeSantos is the lynchpin in our case against some very dangerous people. We have an obligation to his safety. To the safety of his wife, and your child. My ex-wife, they're not married. They were married two days before they entered the program. It's, um, easier for the service to relocate a family. What? You guys are worse than I thought. -Look, Jimmy. -Don't "look, Jimmy" me. As far as I'm concerned, you guys are no better than kidnappers. Now, look, Mr. Van Zandt, I want to see my daughter. -You'll see her. -When? -One weekend per month. -What? You can't call her either, Jimmy, she'll have to call you. Cases like this can drag on for years. Now, I want the same deal I got in the divorce, every weekend. What you ask is impossible, I'm sorry. I'm not the criminal here! Jimmy, take it easy, take it easy. I don't think we've fully explored, uh, my client's options. JIMMY: You were a big help. Did you see that Van Zandt guy? He's like dry ice. I want you to file for full custody. Are you crazy? Even by some stroke of luck I beat the guy. They don't have to comply with a court order. -You heard them. -Do it, Vinnie. -Congratulations. -What for? I've never had a case solve itself. What are you talking about? You hired me to find her, she's found. -What's this? -My bill. We're not through yet. Mr. Scranton? I believe this is yours. What's this? It's a court order to produce Jenny O'Meara for a hearing in seven days. I don't have to accept this. The law says you do. [♪♪♪♪♪] Hey, you. I missed you. JENNY: I missed you, too, Daddy. Come here. Can we have a couple of minutes alone? Absolutely not, I have to supervise. I wanna come visit you. They said I can't talk about where we live. How about school? Can I take a picture at least? VINCENT: Your Honor, by not notifying Mr. O'Meara the moment that they placed his child in the program, the government infringed on his relationship with his daughter. My client, therefore, is asking that full custody revert back to him. May I, Your Honor? The last thing the US Attorney's office wants is to stand between parent and child. We have offered Mr. O'Meara a concession. They've offered him one visit per month. The divorce agreement was loosely worded, as Mr. Infante knows. He negotiated it. We simply cannot afford to move Mr. O'Meara, his ex-wife and his daughter, and two Marshall escorts. In this particular situation, it would also impeach the security of the Witness Protection Program. I've heard about all I need to hear today. I am going to continue this case, pending home and psychiatric evaluations. The social worker was over my house. Went through my closets. Asked me if I watched adult tapes. That sounds like a social worker. I had the shrink on Wednesday. I keep seeing Jenny's face in that courtroom. She was frightened, you know. I hate to put her through that. It makes me sick. I told the shrink that. Piece of advice? Get a new lawyer. Vinnie's not very good, is he? I wanna see you win. JUDGE POWERS: I am going to take this case under advisement. The participants will be notified when I have reached my decision. All rise! JIMMY: This guy looks like he's got one foot -in the grave. -VINNIE: Don't say that, please. -Why not? -I'm superstitious. What does that mean under advisement? Now he's got the reports from the social worker and the psychiatrist. He'll make up his mind, that's it. -But how long? -I don't know, a week. I don't know, maybe longer, I don't know how long. JIMMY: You're killing me, Vinnie, it's taking forever. VINCENT: Look what I'm up against. Every two weeks, regular as clockwork, I get papered by Van Zandt. He's got a staff that thinks up ways to make my life miserable. New interrogatories, amended actions. He wants to depose your mother. Every stalling tactic in the book. So, he thinks I'm gonna win. No, that's not it at all. You're a pain in the butt. They want to exhaust us. Economically and emotionally. And you wanna know something, Jimmy? It's working, this case is killing me. My practice is significantly off. We gotta bite, come on. -ALL: Trick or treat! -Hey. There you go. Don't eat too much at once, all right? All right. All right, good night. ALL: Good night. Be careful, now. Take the deal, Jimmy. Go see Jenny. Once a month is better than what you got now. The longer he mixes it up with the feds, the more scrambled his brains become. Yeah, well, put yourself in his shoes. I have, but he has a business, too. He forgot to sign the check for the beer distributor and they put us on the list. I had to go to the grocery store to buy vodka for the bar. That's illegal, my butt, his license. He doesn't know where the quarterly tax forms are. I mean, if he loses this place... Why don't you just talk to me like you were here? JENNY: Okay. You got a boyfriend at that new school? JENNY: Dad! Come on. JENNY: Tommy Higgins said he loves me. Is he as handsome as you know who? JENNY: You're handsomer. He told two other girls he loved them, too. Well, stay away from fickle boys. THERESA: That's enough, Jenny. JENNY: Mom says I have to hang up. Okay, honey, um. Listen, I love you, I miss you. Call me again, soon, okay? Anytime. -JENNY: Bye, Dad. -Sleep with angels. [LINE DROPS] JIMMY: She said "Y'all" more than once on the telephone. So she's someplace in the South. Enough about me, let's talk about your daughter. Halloween, she dressed up like a ballerina. Little girls love to dress up, like, something pretty. Last year, she was an Indian princess. -Let's dance. -No. -Come on. -No, I forgot how. It's like falling off a bike. Only more fun, oh, come on. -[♪♪♪♪♪] -[INDISTINCT CHATTER] Is something happening between us? You're beautiful, Liz. The timing stinks. VAN ZANDT: I expect you've heard. Judge Powers has retired from the bench, his health. JIMMY: We could have settled this. I'm in a war here. And if my agenda means protecting a small fish like DeSantos in order to take hardcore criminals and their drugs off the streets, I'm going to do it. That's reality, Jimmy. My daughter's a casualty of your war. And so am I. -This is counterproductive. -Stay out of this, Vinnie. You're gonna do this to me again, aren't you? You're gonna find another judge. You're gonna bury me with a mountain of paperwork. Because you're bigger than me. Because you can. Because it's my job. Your job is gonna keep me from my daughter's first communion. From her confirmation. Your job stinks. The bastard is not going to lie down. Hey, Ma. What do you think? Wallet size. Oh, I love it. -Did Jenny call? -No, not yet. [TELEPHONE RINGING] -Hello? Hey, Jenny. -JENNY: Hi. Merry Christmas, Dad. Merry Christmas to you, I love you. JENNY: I love you, too. What's the matter? You sound kinda sad. -Did you get my presents? -JENNY: Huh? Did you like the cable car picture? JENNY: What cable car picture? Did you get the cable car picture? JENNY: I didn't get any presents from you. What do you mean you didn't get my presents? Let me talk to her. Hi, Jenny dear. JENNY: Merry Christmas. ROSE: Oh, Merry Christmas to you, too. Vinnie, what's going on? I wanna know what's going on. This Van Zandt, this machine. -I don't know what's going on. -Day after Christmas, Jimmy. Gimme a second to gather myself. This guy is messing with me and Jenny, directly. She didn't get any of my Christmas gifts. -It's probably the mails. -What do you mean, the mails? She didn't get my Halloween card or any of the letters, okay? The mails? Jimmy, what do you want me to do? What do you want me to do? Tell them I give up. I want to see my daughter. Once a month? Once a month. That's better than what I get now. [♪♪♪♪♪] Looks like your career could use a boost. What do you want? Steer some cases your way. How'd I get to be so lucky? Looks like you could use a new car. I bet your wife could use a vacation. You wanna lay off the furniture, please? All I'd have to do is screw up Jimmy's case, is that it? That's not exactly how I'd put it, councilor. How would you put it? Van Zandt's gonna eat you alive. The man doesn't lose. His staff is geared to take you to the mat. You won't have time for another client until 1995, and I don't think O'Meara's fees are gonna stretch that far. Don't sugarcoat it. Get to the point. The point is economics. You understand economics, don't you? You got your overnight pay? Well, it's important you came with me. Yeah, I know, but something came up. You'll be all right. It's the federal building. Drive into the underground marshal's garage. Go, you'll be all right. You got him down? No, I didn't. Do it. Gee. I could've sworn I was in America. I don't like this any more than you do. The hell's keeping my homing device in a body cavity? You want to take a peek? My daughter's got one just like that. You don't know how to play along, Jimmy. Let me clue you in. You make my life difficult, I make your life twice as difficult. Those papers, you read them and you sign them. What are they? It's a contract between us. They say you won't try to illicit any information from your daughter regarding location, surname, et cetera. You do, and the Marshall's Service will terminate your visit. [♪♪♪♪♪] WOMAN: Attention. Flight 9 for Seattle, -is now boarding at gate seven. -[BEEPS] -MAN: It's all right. -They think I'm under arrest. [♪♪♪♪♪♪] MAN: Tickets, please. MAN: Ticket, please. Thanks. Thank you. Come on. You're going to Denver. Be the last one off, you'll be met. -Enjoy, Jimmy. -Thanks. WOMAN: Flight 13 for El Paso is now boarding Gate 7A. Why don't you get a big sign that says US Marshall on it? You know the drill? Yeah, I know, last one on, last one off, I know. I know this is hard for you, but it's safe this way. For everyone. [♪♪♪♪♪] You scare any children lately? [♪♪♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] -[GARDEN SPRINKLER WHIRRING] -[SIGHS] I'll go get her. [TRAIN HORN BLARING] You're a hard woman. [BIRDS CHIRPING] Go on. Hey, how you doing, huh? You all right? Okay. Look who came to see you. I had to come, Jimmy. I couldn't let her fly alone. That's all right, Theresa. I understand. Listen, I don't have a lot of time and I'd like to spend it with my daughter. So, you know, excuse me, please. [♪♪♪♪♪] ROOSEVELT: Uh, one of us needs to be with you at all times. Take your pick. JENNY: Well, my teacher's okay. I like my old school better. They make fun of the way I talk, so I try to say ain't and y'all like they do, but then mom gets mad. Grandma Rose says to tell you that she loves you and misses you. Gina says the same thing. When you come to visit me, I got a brand new room all fixed up for you. That's where Rose has been sleeping. Excuse me. Can we go someplace or is this house arrest? Oh. Be my guest. Want to go again? -Yeah! -How about you, Roosevelt? I love my job.

It's okay. What do they call it? [PEOPLE SCREAMING] JIMMY: You ever think about having children, Roosevelt? I tell you, it's amazing. You know, sometimes, like today, you get to live through their eyes. That's the selfish part of parenting. And another times, like, in the middle of the night they-- When they have a fever, no matter what you do, you can't bring it down. I tell you, there's no more helpless or scary feeling in the world. Either way, I wouldn't trade it. You should think about it. -Give Daddy a kiss. -Daddy, please don't go. Come on, Roosevelt, let her spend the night. Come on. Theresa doesn't care. It's not gonna hurt anything. call her. Time's up, Jimmy. You're just making it hard on your child. And you know I can't authorize that. I'll see you in the morning, Jen. Sleep with angels. [♪♪♪♪♪] [CRICKETS CHIRPING] [WINDOW HINGE SQUEAKS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] -[CRICKETS CHIRPING] -[DOG BARKING] [LINE TRILLING] [DIAL TONE RINGING] -LIZ: Hello? -Liz. LIZ: Who is this? Jimmy? Yeah, it's me. Listen, I only have a couple of minutes. I saw Jenny alone. I know the city where they moved her. Now, I need you to get to the airport in Waco, Texas. [♪♪♪♪♪] [RINGING] LIZ: Hello? Jimmy? Who is this? JIMMY: How's my big girl? Huh? What's the matter? Do you feel all right? Sleep well? What are you talking about? That was a very dumb thing you did last night. If you wanna get down on me, wait until my daughter's gone. JENNY: She have to be with us next time? I'm gonna miss you. Here, you keep her. Hey, okay. I'll keep her until next time. Give me a kiss. All right, it's time to go. [♪♪♪♪♪] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] You crawled out your window. You made a phone call. I went for a run. I sent a man by Liz Gallagher's. She wasn't home. Where'd she go? I don't know what you're talking about. Phone records said it was a call placed to her number from Texas. Look, what do you want me to say? Come on, you're a father, put yourself in my place. You should have seen the look on my daughter's eyes. It was, like, I had done something wrong. You were not to leave that room except under supervision. You've violated the agreement you signed. I think you wanted to find out where she was so you could go back and kidnap her. Hey, listen, I have every right to know where my daughter lives. Where she goes to school. I have the right to know if she's healthy, because I'm her father. Now, you government guys, I think sometimes you forget your job is to serve. The agreement you signed gives me the right to terminate your visit. How's that for rights? You can forget about seeing that kid. Take your best shot. I want to remove DeSantos and his family from the program. I can't do that. Besides, I'm not through with them yet. You walk into a door? O'Meara? Who the hell does he think he is? Do they know you have Jenny's address? JIMMY: No. One of the marshals delivered this to the club. It's from Theresa. "They said they might move us, Jimmy. But I won't let them pull Jenny out of another school. She just made new friends. It was good for her to see you. I don't know when she can visit again. So I am writing to set some things straight." THERESA: Bobby did a bad thing, but he is not a bad man. I love him, and we are trying hard to be a family during a difficult time. He has turned his life around. We go to church as a family now. He has a trade. And Jenny is beginning to warm to him. "I had a choice to make. I know what I did broke your heart. Please don't hate me. Theresa." I can't hate her. I can't even hate DeSantos. It was just Van Zandt I was fighting at. What they're doing isn't working and I can't think straight. I can't sleep through the night. I kept wondering if what I'm doing isn't driving a wedge between Jenny and me instead of bringing us closer together. Second thoughts? Hell, yes, second and third thoughts. They're rattling you, Jimmy. That's what they want. You're David and they're Goliath. Yeah, but David had a weapon. He had a stone and a thing to throw it with. So, you really like him? He got me right here. I'm worried about him though. Ever since his got back from his trip, he's changed, he's distant. -GINA: Yeah, I know. -Hi, Liz. -LIZ: Hi. -Hey, Gina, has Vincent been in? Uh, not since you went away. Oh, he stopped by that Saturday, had a couple of pops, got sloppy-sentimental, and he paid off his tab. -Really? -GINA: Yeah. It's like he dropped off the face of the earth. I shoulda had some movement on my case by now. Uh, maybe he got busy. Oh, Mick said he saw him driving a new car down Broad. [SCOFFS] Do you believe that? Eight indicted. Eight gang members going to Camp Uncle Sam. I'm accepting their pleas. You saying we didn't need DeSantos after all? On the contrary, our leverage came from one scared worm with a lot to lose. We cut their little hearts right out. So let's put DeSantos and family out to pasture. We still need them. Who's going to touch them, they're all in jail. Don't either of you forget one thing, thank you. As long as O'Meara's... As long as O'Meara's case is on the docket, and it is on the docket, we've got a fight. He's making an assault on our ability to grant immunity. We can't function without that. I want O'Meara neutralized. I do not want a punk like that handcuffing me every time I try to do my job. JIMMY: Could you just check, please? It's Judge Powers' caseload. My name is Jimmy O'Meara it's a custody case. I want to find out if my case has been reassigned? Just a minute. Sir? I don't have all day. Sorry. Seems that your case has not been handed to over to a new judge yet. I don't know if this is against the rule or anything but, could you check Judge Powers other cases? It's not against the rules. Judge's other cases have all been assigned. Looks like yours is the only one that doesn't found a home. [TELEPHONE RINGING] Law offices of Vincent Infante. JIMMY: Is Vinny there? It's Jimmy. One moment. It's Jimmy. Tell him I'm with a client. JIMMY: One case of tequila. Yup. -JIMMY: Two cases of rye. -Okay. -Jimmy? -JIMMY: Yeah. Uh, we need to talk. JIMMY: Hi. That's it. Mick got a check for you at the cash register. Thanks, Jimmy. So, Liz? What's up? I know why your case hasn't found a judge. I ought to break your neck. You're in business with these guys, aren't you? -What are you talking about? -Don't lie to me. Liz pulled your cases at the federal court. All of a sudden you're the busiest lawyer in town. VINCENT: All right. All right. All right. You wanna hit me, huh? You wanna hit me? Go ahead, hit me, you'll feel better? Why did you do it, Vinny? Why did you do it? Money means so much to you? What do you know about what I feel, huh? What do you understand? You got it made, Jimmy. Me, I've been living like I'm a welfare case. I'm the only lawyer in North Beach they laugh at his car. Well, that new car parked down stairs, they don't laugh anymore, Jimmy. And my heart breaks for you. For three years, Marge has begging me to have a kid and I got to tell her, "I can't afford it Marge." What about your integrity, Vinny? "My integrity, Vinny?" Good one. That and a half a buck, I got a cup of coffee. I wasn't doing you no harm. So I'm playing both ends against the middle. What's the big deal? You knew, and I know I couldn't beat Van Zandt. So w-- what's the big deal? So he ask me to stall a little bit. What did I do? Something so harmful to you? [♪♪♪♪♪] You're pathetic. [DOOR CLOSES] This is it? It's nice. Yeah. Wait a sec. Hey, Jimmy, no. [TELEPHONE RINGING] WOMAN: Canyon Airline reservation? Yeah, what have you got going to Waco, Texas, tonight... [♪♪♪♪♪] THERESA: Come on, buckle up.

There's some people making me fight to see you. You're such a big girl. There, there, it's all right. I wish it could be like it used to be. JIMMY: I know. Jimmy. This is Kyle Gorman from the San Francisco Chronicle. He's going to do your story. -KYLE: Nice to meet you. -I don't want to hurt anybody. I just want to tell the truth. What those people are doing. KYLE: Go ahead. [DOOR OPENS] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] What the hell do you think you're doing? The guy can write, huh? You're in way over your head, O'Meara. You know, a mutual acquaintance told me that nobody's after DeSantos. That this was your power play to prove a point. You guys thought you could beat me, huh? -You're in way over your head. -Yeah. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] I want to crush him. Gloves off. Just do it. I'm sure the IRS can find a "“T"” not crossed, or an "“I"” not dotted? He's no rocket scientist. Come on, you guys. Listen to yourselves. We are a team. We will work as a team. Clear? Don't you have a friend that works in ATF? Wouldn't it be a shame if O'Meara got caught serving an under-aged drinker. He might lose his license. I stay up all night reading legal cases. I don't understand half of what they say. MAN: Give me another one. I got circles under my eyes. There you go. Ah, you'll always be beautiful to me. -WOMAN: Thank you. -Thanks. I'm tellin' you Gina, these guys I'm fighting are making me less the man I was. What doesn't kill you, makes you stronger. What doesn't kill you, doesn't kill you. Let me tell you something, Gina. These guys can do this to me, they can do it to you. To any Joe Schmoe on the street. MAN: Excuse me. Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms, Mr. O'Meara. We have a violation here. Is there any place we can talk. Now this guy, Cox, I'm taking you to see, he's the last trick in my bag. Why are you doing all this for me? Yeah, he used to be with the US Attorney's office. Nobody knows better how they operate. I tracked down his ne'er-do-well son-in-law for back support. Yeah? Send them in. Come on here, Liz, come in, sit down. I read the newspaper piece. I saw the segment on the TV. but that's not why I'll take your case, huh. I believe you're right in what you're doing. I believe you got a constitutional basis to support your position. And I believe you can win, with you, it's emotional. If I were in your shoes, I'd feel exactly the same way. I know where the chink in Van Zandt's armor is. You've got him and his policy backed into a corner, and I think you and me will finish him off. Yeah, we got a lot of work to do. So I hope you brought your lunch. You know, you never answered me before. -What? -Why are you doing this for me? I thought you knew. I have a thing for the good guys. And so far, with you, it's unrequited. I don't care about bad timing. [♪♪♪♪♪] You snore. -So do you. -[CHUCKLES] You okay? -Liz... -You don't have to say anything. No, I want to. I don't regret last night. Me neither. I hope I can say this right. I want a relationship. I want a normal life, you know, like anyone. But I can't go in two directions at one time. I see a lot in you that I like, you're beautiful. You're courageous. And I feel like you're my friend. But right now I'm so... [SHUSHES] [TELEPHONE RINGING] Remember that quarterly tax payment? You forgot, didn't you? Meet Mr. IRS. Treasury Agent Yonkouski. I've been ordered to audit your business records, Mr. O'Meara. This is harassment. You know what? Go ahead. Give him anything he wants. You want to use my office? Use my office. You tell Van Zandt if this is his best shot, -he's in trouble. -Yeah. That is good news, Harrison. You're going to have your day in court, Jimmy. Judge Manuel Ruiz will hear your case. Says here, you're going to subpoena Vincent Infante. Yeah, you got a problem with that? No. Okay. Let's get ready to rumble. It is not our intention to impede the relationship between a father and a daughter. No more than it is to deny due process or Constitutional rights. Simply put, this is not a simple case. The issue is the custody of Jenny O'Meara. What we asking Your Honor to answer for us is one of the oldest questions in law. Is the right of the citizen greater than the right of society? It is common in jurisdictions all over the country to grant immunity and protection in order to prosecute a greater menace. Mr. O'Meara's case makes a direct assault on that policy. In order to prosecute this war, society demands swift and reasoned action. My heart goes out to Mr. O'Meara. But it also goes out to all those other parents in this country, whose only hope is for us to put away the vermin who deal drugs to their children. Would you like to address the court, Mr. Cox? I thought I'd give the court time for the smoke to clear. [LAUGHS] The court will do the editorializing, Mr. Cox. Proceed. I'll be brief. Mr. Van Zandt said one thing that I agree with. This case is about the custody of Jenny O'Meara. We are not opposed to protective custody, but we are opposed to the abuse of authority. We want to fight drugs, and crime families, but we can do it without a callousness that isn't part of our value system. With Bobby DeSantos' help, we were able to arrest eight principles in a 60 million-dollar drug ring. He wore recording devices and provided important data at great personal risk. Thank you. These were some dangerous characters, sir, -weren't they? -BORELLI: Yes, sir. Our bail must have been set pretty high. Were any of these suspects able to meet it? No, sir. In fact, all eight plea bargained and are now serving time in federal penitentiaries, isn't that right? BORELLI: That's correct. So these dangerous criminals haven't seen the streets since their arrest, and have been no direct threat to DeSantos or his family. Yes. But that's not the point. Objection, Your Honor. I'm through with this witness. VAN ZANDT: When were you married? September 7th of last year. Do you love your husband? Yes. VAN ZANDT: No further questions. Go easy on her, huh. VAN ZANDT: Your witness, counselor. Mrs. DeSantos, when did you and your family enter the Witness Protection Program? September 9th. Two days after your arranged marriage to a known felon. Object, Your Honor. Sustained. COX: Mrs. DeSantos, did you believe you would not be allowed into the program unless you were married? That's what I was told. COX: Let me be perfectly clear about this. Are you saying that even if this court should rule in my client's favor, you would refuse to comply with that court order? Mr. Scranton? My office would not have to accept that court order. That's what I said. You can't be in here! Arrest me. Hi. -How you doing? -Fine. [♪♪♪♪♪] -You all right? -Yeah. I just came in here to tell you that I love you. You're gonna get in trouble, Daddy. Yeah. Give me a hug. COX: Mr. Infante. You are aware that your answers could cause you to be brought before the bar on disciplinary charges? Yeah. I was approached by Mr. Scranton who offered to send cases my way... if I would stall Jimmy's case. COX: To what end? They thought they could make Jimmy go away. And did you stall? Yeah. Mr. O'Meara's living arrangement is wholesome. More than adequate to raise his daughter. I was sent by the court in my capacity as a psychiatrist to evaluate Mr. O'Meara's fitness as a parent. COX: Would you tell the court the conclusion of your report? It's my opinion that the lifestyle created by the Witness Program could be extremely stressful for the daughter, and that she could not be raised normally in such an environment. I recommend that Mr. O'Meara be given custody. He never missed a visit with her. When they took her away, Jimmy changed. You could see it in everything he did. VAN ZANDT: You don't like me, do you, Mr. O'Meara? What do you think? And you've got quite a temper. If you're talking about why I hit your buddy over there, I think you know. Have you ever hit your daughter? You bastard. This court won't tolerate that language. Would you direct the witness, Your Honor? Your Honor, can I say something? Answer Mr. Van Zandt's question. Why should I have to answer a question like that? Because I can find you in contempt. I have never hit my daughter. Mr. Van Zandt's baiting my client. Your Honor, can I just tell you what happened? I'm not through with my questions. Mr. Van Zandt, the antagonism between you and the petitioner is counterproductive. And your contempt for the power of this lower court is evident as well. -Your Honor... -Don't "Your Honor" me. You know, I'm very disturbed by Mr. Scranton's testimony about not having to abide by my ruling, a position that you have made clear that you support. I am going to let Mr. O'Meara speak. Then I would ask that the record reflect my continues objection. I'll note your objections. Now sit down. Welfare of my daughter... I have this anger. Excuse me. The welfare of my daughter, and my relationship to her is the most important thing to me. A friend of mine once told me I could win this case. She said I could be David beat Goliath. And I said to her, I said I don't have any weapon. But I do, Your Honor. It's a document that's hanging in the corridor of this building. The Constitution. Mr. Van Zandt says he wants you to decide between the rights of society and the rights of the individual so do I, But the thing is... these guys don't play fair. He's harassed me with the IRS. He tried to shut down my bar, deprive me of my livelihood. Corrupted my attorney. I don't have to sit here and listen to my office -being assailed! -These are the facts. These are the facts. These men have treated me like I'm a criminal. Confused my daughter's affections. -All right, Mr. O'Meara. -For what? For what? To protect a system that destroys people's lives so that this man can put another notch on his gun? Are you going to allow this continue? That's enough, Mr. O'Meara. I want you to choose. I want you to choose. I want you to tell me to my face that what these people do is the American way! I gave you your chance. Now, if you go any further I'm gonna find you in contempt in this court. I don't care about contempt. I want you to choose! Choose! Why can't we live near my father? JUDGE RUIZ: That's what we're trying to work out, sweetheart. He did something bad, didn't he? No. No, not at all. He loves you very much. I love him, too. I know that. Would you like to live with him? But what about my mother? She'd be lonely without me. I was so stupid. I lost my temper, maybe, my daughter. The judge is a fair man. He rescinded the contempt charge. I think he was moved. I hope you're right about the good guys winning. MICK: Yo, Jimmy. -Hello? -COX: This is Cox. -Get over to my office. -I'm coming now. [TELEPHONE CLATTERS] You won. -[COX LAUGHS] -I don't get it. Full custody. You can pick Jenny up from the marshal tomorrow morning at 10:00. What? I'm stunned, that's all. Just like that? Just like that. I don't know how to thank you. And you. Well, I'll tell you how you can thank me. You could buy me a drink at that bar of yours. -Let's go. -Well, I got some paperwork to finish up, but, uh, I'll take a rain check. [COX LAUGHS] I know what time it is. I want my full staff in my office and organized in one hour. And while you're at it find me an appellate judge with a heart of stone. Just do it! Why don't you let it go? I can arrange for you to join Scranton, playing checkers while you baby-sit felons in cheap motels. I'm sorry. I had a rare attack of humanity. You fall into patterns. Take life for granted. Well, after today, I can't do that anymore. I wanna-- I wanna live my life. I wanna... What the hell is going on over there? Jimmy. Damn that Van Zandt. ALL: Surprise! [CHEERS AND APPLAUSE] [INDISTINCT CHATTER] Darling. -Hey. -GINA: So proud. Congratulations, Jimmy. [♪♪♪♪♪] Took a lot of guts to do what you did Vincent. You're a good friend. Thank you, Jimmy. LIZ: Come here, you. [INDISTINCT CHATTER] GINA: Can I have your attention everybody? Hey, hey, hey, attention. All right. Does everybody have a glass of bubbly? -ALL: Yes. -GINA: Okay. Okay, here's a toast to the best dad we know in the saloon business. [ALL LAUGH] Hear, hear. Hey, those are my glasses! -Oh, you can get some more. -Oh, you can get some more. [ALL LAUGH] [DOOR CLOSES] They want us out of the program now. Too much publicity. They say we've breached security. You're gonna be fine. Those guys can't touch you from jail. Yeah. [SIGHS] You know this wasn't about taking Jenny away from you. I only wanted her be back in my life like she used to be. I know. Oh, Jimmy, I don't know what I'm going to do without her. Theresa, please, don't do this, it's all right. I swear it'll be... it'll be all right. We'll work something out. You can see her whenever you want to. I, uh, gotta go. You take care. Excuse me, miss. Would you tell Mr. Scranton my daughter should have been here an hour ago. Mr. Scranton got transferred. Where is she? She's not coming, Jimmy, I'm sorry. Van Zandt has decided to appeal. [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪]
