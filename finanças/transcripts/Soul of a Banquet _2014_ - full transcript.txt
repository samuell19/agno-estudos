I was born in, uh, Wuxi. It's a small town near Shanghai. When I was four years old, from Wuxi we moved to Beijing. And I'm from a very big family. We have 12 children-- nine girls and three boys. And I'm number seven daughter in the family. We live in a big house, and also-- We have also a big kitchen. And when we were small, we're not allowed to go to the kitchen... to do the cooking. And my mother was the one... supervised all the food... and running the household. And my father was very-- had very modern mind. Kind of very open. So-- And very funny. Usually, in Chinese family, father is the strict one and the mother is the kind one. But in our family, just opposite. My mother is a tough one, but my father is very open and always discuss things with us. I feel like Cecilia is one of the last of an old school. She's one of the last people... who really grew up... in sort of Chinese splendor, in a very traditional family. Very fortunate that her mother's feet were bound, and for the great, good fortune, her father decided that none of those girls' feet were going to be bound. Think about how different her life would have been... if they had been traditional enough. She would not be alive. But she had this extraordinarily happy childhood, growing up in a very large family... with an extremely competent mother-- who ran the household with a fist of iron... but cared deeply about food, knew about food-- and, apparently, a very kind father... who educated all his daughters beautifully. Cecilia and all of her sisters went to college. So she grew up probably at a very rare moment... in Chinese history, where she spanned the old traditions... and the coming of the new. When we were little, we're not allowed to sit with my father to eat. My father usually always sit first, alone, on the table. Then my mother prepare... six or eight small dishes. And then let my father sit down there... and enjoy all these dishes... with a little champagne, maybe vermouth... or sometimes sherry, all the different French wine. They say, "Oh, we smelled it from outside the door." So we try to sneak in. So my father saw us, said, "Come on. Come right in." So he invite us in the dining room. Then we're going, "Papa, what are you having?" So my father said, "Here's a chopstick. Come here and taste this." And then even sometimes give us a little wine to taste. "Oh," we say, "that's just so wonderful." And then my mother asked my father, "Oh, what do you think about these dishes?" So my father explained. "Oh, this one, I think it needs a little bit more spice. Not enough flavor. That one, I think, a little bit salty." Always say that. "Oh, that's a very good dish maybe with wine." So when we were little, we learned this-- how to-- the flavor of-- the taste of the food. And also, that time I realize... not only the Chinese wine goes well with the Chinese food. And even the French wine and champagne. And pairing with Chinese food is excellent. I once asked her about an appetizer dish... that she was serving at the Mandarin. And she said, "Oh, this is something... that my mother used to make for my father." And I have this sort of memory of standing in the kitchen with Cecilia, watching her tasting things and shaking her head... and throwing in a little more salt or a little more ginger. Um, so one of the things that I think is extraordinary about her... is that she has this taste memory that's locked in, that goes back to a time-- There aren't a lot of people alive... who remember the food of that China. The great food of the great houses... when you had chefs who had been classically trained. And, um, somewhere deep inside of her is this memory... of what that food should taste like. And part of it comes from having sat at her mother's table, not being in the kitchen, not being allowed in the kitchen, but sitting there, tasting the food... and knowing that because it was on their table, it was right. She said that she had come from Japan, where she was living with her husband and her children. And her sister needed her. And so she had gotten a three-month visa to come here. And, um, while she was here, she met some people... who wanted to open a restaurant, and, um, they needed money. And with kind of typical Cecilia generosity, she lent them the money to start this and signed the lease. And then they all backed out. And she was left with a restaurant... in a country that she was going to have to leave any minute... 'cause she only had a three-month visa. And she was a little nervous about telling her husband what she had done. And she realized she had to make a success of it, that her honor was kind of in it. And she became a very accidental restaurateur. I opened a Chinese restaurant outside Chinatown. I got no choice, because first thing-- I'm not Cantonese. I doesn't speak any Cantonese. And I don't even understand Cantonese. And when I go to Chinatown-- Those days, if you don't speak Cantonese, they treat you like a foreigner. They fence you out. So even if I want to move to Chinatown, I cannot get in. I don't speak their language. They treat me like enemies. Mm-hmm. So finally, I-- I, uh, pick up this by-- pick up this place also by coincidence, by mistake. I didn't think about I'm going to open a restaurant. Because my friends asked me to deal with them for the lease. Then they back out. I got stuck. And maybe-- maybe that's because of my destiny. I think it was fated. So my-my-my life, whole life, it changed. It's very hard now... for any American to understand... what the state of Chinese food in America was at that point. Um, for a lot of reasons, mostly immigration laws, there were no Chinese cooks in America. And the restaurant-- There were many Chinatowns all over America. Chinatown New York. Chinatown L.A. Chinatown in San Francisco. But the food that-- for the most part-- that was served in those restaurants... was, um, food that was not cooked by chefs 'cause there were no chefs here. So it was food cooked by Chinese people... who were nostalgic for the food of China. But, um, most of the people here came out of a peasant tradition. They weren't cooks anyway. Um, the food became Americanized... as Americans went and discovered-- So it was not, um, in any respect... like great Chinese food. I want do something totally different from Chinatown. Whatever they serve the food on the menu, I'm not going to serve. Somehow-- Those days I was quite young. I don't have any experience running a restaurant. Somehow I just thought-- Anything-- the chop suey, egg foo yong-- I'm not going to serve. I want do something totally different. And I want to serve real Chinese food... and educate the American... how to eat real Chinese food. Just shortly after Chez Panisse opened in 1971, Marion Cunningham invited me... to come to a cooking class at the Mandarin. Now, Cecilia... not only sort of guided us through the cooking class, but she guided us through the whole menu... and how we were to experience Chinese food, not like any other cuisine that I had experienced before, and why certain courses came first... and, uh-- and what ones came next... and how you had to really prepare yourself for a real banquet. Uh, that everything had to do with textures and colors, how it had to do with the time of year, how it had to do with good health, how it had to do with lots of vegetables. It had to do with sort of cleansing of the palate. It had to do with portion size. And everything just came together. It made sense to me that they were close friends, because there's something similar about them. They're two very fierce women-- two women who were running restaurants who were not chefs. And two women... who had a notion of why they were running the restaurants... which did not correspond with anybody else, with what anybody else was doing. Um, they both had an idea that transcended just feeding people. Um, and neither of them did it to become rich or famous. Um, and I think for Cecilia, it was very much about giving her history... to an American public, about her enormous pride in her upbringing, her knowledge that the China that she had grown up in no longer existed... and her attempt to save it in some way, to show people what it was and how it tasted... and what that food meant. And Alice, in her own way, wanted to do the same thing. I know that I was sort of well trained in rebellion. Being part of the free speech movement and the antiwar movement... in the United States in the '60s. And-- And so it-- it just seemed reasonable for me, uh, to-- to open a place... and feel like people would come to it-- a different sort of restaurant. I didn't want that sort of very fancy stiff French restaurant. I wanted a kind of country place. And I had no idea that it would seem so unusual... at the time. I basically just-- May I say something? Wanted it for my friends. Yes. Remember when you would talk... about Chez Panisse and everything? You said, uh, "My restaurant is not-- I'm not going into it just to make money. I want to make my restaurant like a little club... for my friends to get together." Remember that? Mm-hmm. I do. So I said, "Well, you also probably like to make a little money too." Cecilia is, in many ways, the history of China... in almost the last hundred years. And she is very much a person who has never let fate push her around. I mean, she has controlled her own destiny. She walked out of China. She came to the United States. She worked incredibly hard, and she grabbed every opportunity. She never waited for anything to come for her. She went out and took it. And she has this very optimistic kind of American spirit. And when she went back to China in 1974, she discovered something really shocking to her... and discovered that for many people, life had been very different. Yeah, the last time I saw them, that was 1946. I went to Beijing. Then I went to see them. Like, 1974, during Cultural Revolution. So about 37 years I haven't seen them. And so a lot of things happened in-- We just lost contact, because that time we cannot write to them. And they can't-- They didn't even know where we were also. So 1970, '72-- Then we got a telegram-- actually is my sister Sophie. That time she was live in San Francisco. So she got a telegram... from my younger sister. Says my father is very sick, hope some of the girls go back to see him. During the Cultural Revolution, some of the famous chef, they change their profession. They've got no choice... because the government force them. And also they have no demand. They cannot find a good job for-- No more restaurants. In China, they're called No menu, nothing. Just four dishes and one soup. You have no-- no choice. A fixed price. So everybody eat the same thing. You have no demand. You say, "Oh, I want a banquet." Nobody can cook a banquet. Nobody knows how. What Mao did to Chinese food was a crime. He basically took this great legacy and destroyed it. And the great chefs of China either left... or they were sent out to be reeducated. And so you have this huge gap... when no great Chinese chefs are being trained. And what was eaten during the Cultural Revolution... was basically one big pot. It was a kind of subsistence stew. And Chinese food, as it has been known for thousands of years-- the great tradition-- had come screaming to a halt. In 1983, Cecilia invited our friend Marion Cunningham and myself... to go on a culinary tour of China. And we arrived in Beijing in the middle of the night. And they had to turn the lights on at the airport... so that our plane could come in. We were the only plane arriving at that airport in the night. We went to this, um, Peking duck restaurant... that Cecilia was so excited about... and discovered that it wasn't the same as she remembered. And people weren't attentive and the duck was very greasy. The most amazing lunch was presented... at, uh, the Summer Palace. But we were the only people there. Now, I can't say that the food was exceptional, but the place was exceptional. And, again, Cecilia was very disappointed with the service. People didn't seem to be paying attention. And I think, uh, the food had been brought from elsewhere. It wasn't until we went to Taiwan afterwards... that Cecilia explained that most of the chefs had left China... and were cooking in Taiwan at the time. We had some exceptional banquets-- in fact, stunning banquets in Taiwan. I learned so much about Chinese food there. There's this new generation of young Chinese-American chefs... who do very interesting food. But they've never tasted great classic Chinese cooking. And they're throwing out something... that they don't even know about. I mean, they're, um-- It's like they're starting in the middle... instead of starting from a baseline... of having learned all of the cla-- Once you know all the classics, you can throw them out. But you need to know them before you abandon them. You need to have them firmly rooted in your psyche... and in your cooking... before you say, "Okay, I don't want to do this anymore." And it's-- For me, it's like there's a generation of young Chinese chefs... who do interesting things, but would do so much more interesting things, would be such better chefs, if they had the grounding... in the kind of food that Cecilia makes. Chinese food, mostly, is really the prep work. Cuts a long time. For just a simple three dishes-- It's still beautiful. I just love it. This dish takes one hour just cutting. Just think how fine-- It's so amazing. Think on how small diced-- I do. This a big-- That's thick piece of So it's cut-- But if you don't cut that fine, it won't taste good. People don't understand it. Like, sometimes my daughter ask me, "Mama, do you really have to cut that fine?" I say, "Yeah, you don't have to." I have plenty. I say, "You don't have to cut that fine, but won't taste good." You can cut that-- It tastes really quite different. Just kind of marries in a different way. And it's something-- But now these days the kids just-- they don't want to spend that kind of time. They rather do something else. It's because they haven't learned about it. And I think we all have a kind of desire... to be connected with gardens and nature... and that we really do love the culture of the table. We do like to cook. But we haven't been given an opportunity to do it. I love to have a good soup. So I cook a good soup. I make my own chicken broth. I make my own beef stock. That takes forever. Slow, slow cook. But I-- It smells good. I also like the smell. So do I. Yeah, in the-- That look like a home. You walk in. "Oh, boy, this is a home." You know? One of the things that was great about it-- When she would give a banquet, she always knew what your favorite dishes were. So you would show up, and, um, you would realize that she had paid real attention... when you were eating. You thought you were just eating a dinner at the Mandarin. And she was paying attention to what you particularly liked. You know, I miss her restaurant so much. So much. I-I-I-- It was a taste of food... that really feels like... it rarely exists in San Francisco. Sometimes in people's homes, you know. Sometimes in restaurants... when somebody is doing something really intentional. But the quality of the food, the whole ambience of the place, the very precise dishes of northern China-- You know, the way that Cecilia-- the hospitality of the meal, uh, just doesn't exist anymore. And so I just thought... there are so many people who would like to experience that again. And I said, "Well, would you like to do a party for the 40th birthday of Chez Panisse?" You frying some rice? May I wash this? Okay. Thank you. The invitation says she's an icon-- The invitation says she's an icon in Mandarin and Chinese cuisine. Last minute the office called Cheng. Because at 6:30 will come. I still don't quite get it. So in other words, Alex and Joe will-- How-- They're gonna come and just go around... and put a little piece on? They're going to serve it? They're supposed to serve it, put it on your plate. I-- My suggestion is to put it on a cart, and we'll set it up. Because we're going to serve that first thing. That's going to be our first thing? Yeah, that first thing is clear. You can have that chair. Hmm? Okay. Yeah. Thank you. Bonsoir. I want to tell you about tonight's dinner. The dinner is family style banquet. It's nothing that fancy. It has shark fins and very nice soup. And this is-- Most dishes I cooked tonight... is, uh, from my mother's recipes. And, uh-- So it's very simple, but it is very tasty, I hope. The pork kidney-- usually somehow Cantonese don't use that much. I think first thing it's very hard to clean, very hard to prepare. So first thing you have to buy real fresh. Then you remove the white thing inside. And then slice very thin. Then you shred it. Cut it. Slice it. Then when you cook it, then they open up like a flower. You like that? What is this? Oh, this is pork. You want some spinach? This is the pork. Pork kidney. Yes. Then you put it on the top. The "bon bon" is just a little nickname. Maybe they kill this chicken by use the bon. Bon bon. The bon bon in China is just a stick-- a wooden stick. Kill the chicken. And, actually, the real name of this chicken, they call-- That means "very odd flavor." Odd-flavor chicken... have five-- five different flavors. Have a little-- little sweet, a little sour, a little, um, spicy, and also salty. Before you eat it, before you taste it, you try to figure out what is-- After you finish, there's an odd distant flavor... still linger around in your mouth. One of the great things about the Mandarin-- When you went there, she would come and do this. And so you weren't just eating food. She was giving you the context. Yep. Yes. She was making it kind of magic for you. This is fresh wood ear. And also this is wolfberry. This is imported from China. Goji. Goji. Goji. Goji. But somehow, this two-- Now, this two dishes in China is very popular. This goji very good for your eyes. And also lower-- lower your cholesterol. This is what a Chinese doctor told me. This fresh abalone. And Bill, he caught himself. Wow. And serve it and also slice it. It's a fresh and paper-thin slice. So this is a very unusual dish. This is-- This dish we change a little bit. In the menu, we said pick whole long Chinese string beans... and used to cook with pork. But today, since we have a whole abalone, we use only in the middle part. And peppercorns, add some more. So we cook this dish of rabbit. Celebrate the Year of Rabbit. But there is something very special. Rabbit only in Sichuan province. Yes, I remember that. They eat it-- You remember. Because all the other provinces, the people, they don't eat rabbit. All right. Let's transport it out. Yeah. Ha ha! The story behind this chicken is-- In China, in the old days, we have a lot of poor people. Everybody knows that. So they cannot afford it to buy a chicken. So they steal this chicken... in somebody's backyard somewhere. And they don't have a stove. They don't have anything to cook with. So they just kill the chicken... and then get some mud and the clay, put it on. And then started the wildfire outdoors and then bake it. So this is called "beggar's chicken." Hard. Hard! Okay. Ah! There we go. Thank you. Thank you. So good. Because I got a fresh plate. I must say one thing. Today all the dishes you're having here... I don't think you're getting anywhere else. Not in the restaurants. Not even in New York. This is red-cooked pork. That's my signature dish. This is what they call-- One of the most popular dish now is pork belly. Pork belly. Now even French Laundry serve this. Red-cooked in China we call hongshao. That's a typical Shanghai dish. And somehow the Shanghainese people love a little sweetness. This is my mother's favorite dish. And I remember when we were kids... we just use the juice-- Put a bowl of steamed rice, white rice. We finish a bowl of rice. Let me tell you my favorite Cecilia story, which is like right after I first met Cecilia. She and Marion and Alice went to China. And Marion, famously, doesn't drink. And Alice was pregnant. And Cecilia took them to banquet after banquet... where, you know, there would be 32 toasts. And Alice said, "Cecilia drank her toast. She drank Marion's toast. She drank my toast." Because she didn't want to be impolite. And she was still standing at the end of every banquet. That's great. And-- The unstoppable Cecilia Chiang. This is, uh-- Oh, fantastic. Wong have to say something. This is so great. Yeah, this was a pork belly with black sesame paste inside... and sticky rice under pork belly. Thick chili. Mmm. That looks good. Yes. Cecilia. Oh. Okay. This is something, um-- I have to say something about the fish. In China, the fish always come last, because this is-- Fish in China pronounced yu, Y-U. The Chinese would say-- And this is-- Because the sound "yu" means you're going to leave something... for next generation for tomorrow. So always have something left... for your kids for next year. So we don't eat-- We don't eat this all. A very memorable night I had at the Mandarin... with a group of wonderful friends of Cecilia's. And we were gathered at this big table in the corner of the restaurant. And Cecilia had brought in special dishes from home... that were very elegant. And, uh, she brought in the soup... in this beautiful bowl with a top on. And when she lifted the top, we saw the soup all covered with coriander. And exactly at that moment, there was an earthquake. And-- And we were startled. The soup just went up and back. And I just sort of thought it was part of the performance. It was like-- It's like part of the drama of eating at the Mandarin.
