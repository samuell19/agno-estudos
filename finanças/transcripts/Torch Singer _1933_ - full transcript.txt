$1.60, lady. Well? I've only got $1.55. Oh, yeah? All right, lady, give me the $1 and keep the change. But... Listen, lady, don't ever argue with a taxi driver. Some of us is hard eggs. I've had a couple of kids me-self. I know what it's like to be a mother. Thanks. Good luck! St. Anne's Hospital. Room 46? Yes, hold the line. Dr. Koenig sent me. St. Anne's Hospital. Mrs. O'Connor? Yes. An 11-pound baby boy. This way, please. St. Anne's Hospital. Be seated. Mother Angelica will see you in just a few minutes. Your name is Dora Nichols? Yes. And your address is 1014 Brooks Avenue, Bronx? Yes. And your husband, Mrs. Nichols? My husband was killed two months ago. I'm so sorry, my poor child. And now, if you'll wait outside a few minutes. Scared? Stiff. You and me both. Ain't women darned fools? Will you come in, please? Yes. Your name is Sally Trent? Yes. Your address is 816 East 97th Street? Yes. And your husband? I haven't any husband. You'll have to give me the name of the baby's father. No, I'd rather not. I'm afraid I must insist. I'm sorry, I'll have to go somewhere else. Sit down, my child. Good. And how are you feeling this morning? Swell! Think you'll care for a little breakfast? What have you got? What would you like? Have you got any cantaloupe? I think so. Some cantaloupe, ham and eggs, and some toast that should be buttered. And some gooseberry jam. We must have plenty to eat. I hope the Trent girl pulls through. It's such a nice baby. Don't leave me, Mike! Don't leave me, Mike! Don't go! Isn't there anything more you can do for her, Doctor? Mike! What she needs is a new body with some strength to it and Mike. Come closer. Mike. Mike. Mike. It isn't a Mike. It's a Sally. Why couldn't you have been a boy? This world's such a tough place for a girl to come to. Good morning, everybody! Good morning. Hello. Hello, Dora. And how are all the little mothers this morning? Just fine. That's good! And where is my son? I'll get him for you. Well, we are all set, kid. Did you find an apartment? Did I? Wait till you see it! It isn't so big, but it's a lovely neighborhood for the children, and the view as far as your eyes can see. The river? No, garbage cans. Dora, I hate to sponge off you like this. Don't be dumb. I got a job to go back to. Well, I'll have one before long. There'll be a lot of shows opening soon. Sure there will. Besides, honey, you know nothing about babies, and I know nothing about babies, so we got to stick together! He's all ready, Dora. Oh, no, he isn't! Not again! He's wonderful that way. What's the bow-wow doing? Sally's not going to cry. No, Sally's a big girl now. She loves to take her bath. Yes. There, it'll be all over in a minute. Yes, and it'll feel so good. There. Where's my soap? Bobby, where's my soap? Where's... Here it is! There's the soap. Yes, there. Did you see Bobby steal the soap? Did you see that naughty boy? There, there! Now, it's all over. It's all over. It's all over, honey. Up we go. Come on. There! It's all over. Look. You're not gonna cry. Look what a good boy Bobby is. He didn't cry one bit. When Mommy comes home, I'm going to tell her how good you've been. Yes. Look, and Sally's such a big girl. You lay off my daughter, you little flirt! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Oh, dear! Don't be a crybaby But the boogeyman will get you If you let him catch you Starting to sing the blues Don't be a crybaby Hello, Dora. What's eating you? The big stiff! Who? My boss, the dirty old coconut! What did he do? He has been creeping up on me for the past week. Well, today, just when I was getting ready to leave, he makes a pass at me. I says, "Take your hands off of me!" He says, "Don't act like that. "How would you like to come and see me tonight "and play hide and seek?" I says, "Listen, you, you snake in the bush, "if you and I was Adam and Eve, "I wouldn't go hide and go seek you!" Then I wallop him! Oh, Dora! When he open his eyes, he says, "How you like me to fire you?" I say, "You won't get a chance, you big bozo, for I'm leaving." So I slammed the door right in his nose. What day is this? Friday. Good. I got fish. Bobby! Here, let me. Oh, my goodness. Now listen, boy, you'd better hurry and grow up. You might have to support the whole family. Hey, wait for me. Come on! I never heard anything so preposterous! You don't know what you're asking. Yes, I do. I'm asking you to take care of Michael's baby, his and mine. I've tried to do it myself. I've tried like the devil. Don't mind me, Miss Alden. I'm liable to say much worse before I'm through. There's only one thing I care about now, to give my baby a chance. Is that asking too much? If my nephew is involved, as you say he is, why didn't you settle this matter with him before he left for China? I don't know. Maybe I had some pride then. How do I know, Miss... Trent, Trent. Sally Trent. How do I know, Miss Trent, that your claims are to be believed? Because... Because I'm telling you. Very true, Miss Trent, but a woman I've never seen before or even heard of! And you'll never see or hear of me again, I swear it! I'll give up all claim to my little girl. I'll sign any kind of a paper you like. I'll even promise never to see her again. How do you like that, Miss Alden? How would you like never to see your baby again? There's some mistake, Miss Trent. I've never had a baby. That's too bad. It might do you some good! It might soften you a bit! Oh, no, no! No, no, I'm sorry! I'm... That's not what I meant to say at all. Please forgive me! Please! And say you will take her. I'm sorry, Miss Trent, but I'm not interested. Have you exhausted every possibility? Yeah, I even did that. Well? She wasn't interested. Baby. What became of Dora? Baby. Dora was swell to me, but she lost her job, and she decided to marry a boy from out West. Dora's the kind of girl that some guy always wants to marry. I get a lot of proposals, too, but marriage isn't one of them. I'm sorry. Well, kid, I'll be a seeing you. Baby. Sally, you understand that if you give up your baby it will be completely and forever. Sure I do! Let's get it over with! I'll go and get the papers ready for you to sign. I haven't been much good to you, have I? Maybe you... Maybe you'll take a mother's advice before she goes. You might as well. That's all she's got to give you. Don't ever let any man make a sucker out of you. Make them know what you're worth. Anything they get for nothing is always cheap. There's just one thing, Mother. Would you fix it so her name will always be Sally? It's sort of... It's sort of silly not to know your own kid's name, isn't it? Of course, my dear. I promise. Is that all? That's all. Baby. Baby. I only know That I can't go on, darling And here Hes love Well, Miss Benton... You don't have to say it. I was terrible. No, no, no. Your voice is okay. What you need is experience. What kind of experience? Well, you know, see something of life, learn how to suffer. A woman must suffer much before she can sing a little. I see. Come back to me in about a year. All right. In the meantime, watch me suffer. It's a long dark night Come on home, Daddy 'Cause I'm lonely and blue You know I worry, Daddy Won't you hurry? Mama's waiting for you Now you know it ain't right To fool me, baby 'Cause I'm faithful and true And I won't struggle h' you want to snuggle Dear, I'm waiting for you Although you've kept me yearning I hope my yearning is through I've kept those home fires burning So give your devil her due Come and hold me tight You great big baddie And do, do like you do It's, oh, so cold out I can hardly hold out Still I'm waiting for you Miss Benton, you are marvelous! So you think I've suffered enough, do you? Waiter, bring me a telephone, please. I want you to be hostess in my night club. Are you tied up here with a contract? I'm not tied up anywhere. I'm as free as a bird on the wing. Splendid! Lend me your pencil, please. Thanks. This is Tony Cummings speaking. Cummings, of the American Radio Corporation. I wonder if you'd care to take luncheon with me tomorrow. No, no, I'll stop by for you. Why don't you ring me at noon and verify this? My number is Vanderbilt 39970. I look forward to it. And now about terms. Yes, terms. But I warn you, I'm going to cost you a lot of money. That'll be okay. I'm a slave to you Don't you want the heart I gave to you? You can have me if you want me But you must be mine alone Give me liberty or give me love You're so dear to me I wish I was like that. I'm in heaven If you were, I'd smack you down. When you're near to me You can have me if you want me Carlotti, she is superb. Yes. But you must be mine alone I give her her chance. Give me liberty or give me love I'm only a slave to you Now you can have me if you really want me Give me liberty or love You're so dear to me When you are near to me You can have me But you must be mine alone Give me liberty or give me love You've been kind of strange Why the sudden change? Do you want somebody new? I'd be glad to share... How do you like her? I don't care for any woman as notorious as Mimi Benton. What has her private life got to do with it? It isn't private. It's a public scandal. Well, Mrs. Judson, those stories are very much exaggerated. I want you both to meet her. Yours to have and hold and call your own, dear You can have me if you want me But you must be mine alone Give me liberty or give me love Give me liberty or love Of course you don't want to dance with me, my dear. Not with you, Andrew. You have no rhythm in your soul. However, if Tony would care to join me... Care? Why, Mrs. Judson, this is one of the big moments of my life. I'm Mimi Benton. How do you do? Miss Benton, I'm afraid I'm all right. I'm Andrew Judson of the Judson Pure Food Corporation. No! Yes. That's marvelous! I've heard Tony speak of you 100 times. Yes? Where is Tony? He's fighting... I mean, he's dancing with my wife. Tony's very fascinating. Aren't you afraid you'll lose her? I don't think there's a chance. I've been asking Tony for weeks to bring you up some evening. Yeah? Well, that's funny. He never said a word to me about it. No? Poor Tony! He's such a jealous boy. Jealous of me? That's nonsense. Look here, I'm giving a little party tonight. Tony'll be there. Don't you want to come over? I'd love to, but... Bring Mrs. Judson, of course, yes, if you think she'll be amused. She wouldn't. No, she wouldn't. I'm sure she wouldn't. You come up anyhow. I've so wanted to meet you. Say yes. Say yes? Yes. I want you to tell me all about Pure Foods. We'll talk until dawn. I don't stay up that late on account of my lumbago. Lumbago? I have something grand for lumbago. Yes? Yes. I'll fix you up. I am Edwardo Pasquale of the Baltimore Opera Company. I must see the big man from the radio, Mr. Cummings. Good afternoon, Miss Benton. Hello, Helen. I'm sorry, but Mr. Cummings is busy. Hello, Dorothy. Mr. Cummings is busy, Miss Benton. All right. Well, you just tell him I'm here, and I'll wander around. All right. I don't think he's telling me the truth. Excuse me. Yes? Who? My apologies to Miss... Tell the young lady I'll see her in just a moment. Thank you. I want to know everything that happened. Well, Mrs. Judson, Mimi spent the entire evening treating your husband's lumbago. I hope I never have the misfortune to encounter that wretched creature! Forget it, Julia. We came here to listen to our first Pure Foods' broadcast, not to talk about Miss Benton. Will you pardon me just a moment? Why, certainly. Thank you. Tony, darling! What's the matter? What brings you down here so early? The Judson Pure Food broadcast. Juddy told me all about it last night. You know me, anything for a laugh. He didn't ask you down here, did he? Well, yes and no. Is that so? Well, you'd better make yourself scarce around here. Mrs. Judson's in there with him. Oh, goodie! I want to meet her. No, you don't, Mimi. Come on now. Yes, I do. Hello, Miss Benton. Hello. What goes on here, a marathon race? She's an expert in child psychology. In a few seconds, she's facing the mike for the first time. It looks as if she's facing a firing squad. Hello. Miss Spaulding, time to go on. Now, now... That's not going to bite you. You go in there and knock them cold! If only I could knock them as cold as I am right now. Go on. Little boys and girls of Radioland, you are going to hear the first program we are sending you by Aunt Jenny. Now, Aunt Jenny is going to tell you all about lovely Oatina, made by the Judson Pure Foods Company. Aunt Jenny will sing you songs, tell you stories and play games with you, just like your own auntie. Here she is, kiddies. Good evening... little children. This is your Aunt... No, no. Here I am, darlings, your Aunt Jenny. You know what interrupted me just now? A big dragon sneaked up behind me and grabbed me by the shoulder. "Listen here, Aunt Jenny," he said, "you can't talk to all those boys and girls "because maybe some of them have been bad, "and the bad ones belong to me." So I said to him, "What do you mean, bad? ”Maybe some of them are naughty once in a while, but who isn't?" When I was a little girl, I was pretty naughty myself, but no bad dragon ever got me. And do you know why? Because I always ate Oatina, so you see... It makes everybody feel like singing, and there's nothing dragons hate so much as a song. So just to spite that old grouch, I'm going to sing. You're wanted in the control room immediately. Tell him I'll be there in a minute. Yes, sir. And now, good night, children. Be sure and tune in again tomorrow night and hear Aunt Jenny. This program has come to you through the courtesy of the Judson Pure Foods Company, sponsoring Oatina. That was marvelous! Congratulations, my dear Tony. The woman you picked for Aunt Jenny is a winner. Thanks. Such refinement and such charm. I always say you can tell a true gentlewoman by her voice. Have her in, Mr. Cummings. I must meet her. Yes, by all means. With this woman at the microphone, Oatina should be a sensation. A positive sensation! What's the matter, Andrew? Nothing. Yes, Tony, we must meet her, by all means, but some other time. Come, dear, I have a very, very important engagement. I'm sorry you have to go. So am I. Goodbye, Mrs. Judson. Can't you have dinner with us tonight? Sorry, I'm sponsoring a new program. I'm so sorry. Another night soon? I'll be very glad to. Goodbye. Goodbye, Tony. Goodbye, Juddy. "Such refinement! Such charm!" I suppose you know what you've done. Sure, I've been having the time of my life. I could kill you. You could? That's gratitude. Where would your Pure Foods hour be if it weren't for me? Mimi, dear, you were wonderful, but you've got to understand my position. What is it? Supposing word got around that the most notorious torch singer in town was broadcasting to kiddies. Well, who's going to tell them? That's not the point. Listen, boy, I only tell bedtime stories to grownups. Now, come on, I've wasted enough time around here. But, Mimi, listen, you've got to be reasonable. Take me to 21. Mimi, don't you understand? What's going to... No! Good morning, Carrie. Well, in the name of say, you can't come in here! I'm in, Carrie. No, sir, Mr. Cummings. I wouldn't take the responsibility of trying to get Miss Benton up out of bed at this hour of the morning. No, sir. I wouldn't have it on my conscience. See what you can do. Yes, sir, Mr. Cummings. I sure will. Miss Benton. Miss Benton, honey. Time you was getting up, sweetie lamb. What time is it? Land sakes, honey, it's going on 1:00. Why, you! Miss Benton, don't throw that clock at me. Mimi, it's Tony. So that's who it is! Waking up people in the middle of the night, who does he think he is, Paul Revere? I'll tell that one where to get off! Why, you big... Pure Foods! Listen, Mimi, we... I wouldn't listen to Gabriel's trumpet before I've had my coffee. Coffee? No, thanks. Juddy? No, thanks. I believe not. Carrie! What do you want, honey? Coffee before I murder you. Coming right in, sweetie lamb. Mimi, will you listen to me for just one second? Sure I will. Why don't you say something? It's about your broadcast. What about it? Mr. Judson and I want you to continue as Aunt Jenny. That's a panic, Tony! This is not a joking matter. Why, Mimi, you were a sensation. Telegrams, letters and the telephones we've received. Are you two boys trying to kid me? I was never more serious in my life. If the Judson Pure Food hour is to continue, Miss Benton, we simply must have you. Take a look at this contract, Mimi. I'm sure you'll be pleased with the terms, Miss Benton. Now, look, every day at 5:00 you broadcast in the studio for only 15 minutes. Not me! What? Studio's out. You have to bring the microphone to my apartment. Now, Mimi, be reasonable. You know that's impossible. What do you mean? It's not impossible for opera stars, is it? Anything that's good enough for a prima donna is good enough for this prima donna! Now, listen, Mimi dear. No. If I'm going to tell bedtime stories, I'll tell them from my own bed. Excuse me, Miss Benton, but the men have come about your radio. There's nothing the matter with my radio. They've got the wrong apartment. Send them away. Wait a minute. Send them in. Have you forgotten? You've got a broadcast. Broadcast? Well! What do you mean, broadcast? Yes! WOMAN: What are you trying to do, put one over on us? Well, what is this all about? Listen, children, I've got a surprise for you. You'd better hang around. I've got a new racket. I'm telling bedtime stories for the Judson Pure Foods Company. All right, boys, set it up in the other room. Look at her, she's dying. Come on, kids, out, out. You can't stay here while Mimi's broadcasting. Come on. Don't be like that! Come on, gather around, children. Your Aunt Jenny's going to tell you fairy tales. One, two, three, four. Okay. Everything all set, Harry? All right, Mr. Cummings. All right, Mimi. Here's your script, Miss Benton, and the lullaby. Lullaby? All ready. Listen, if you think I'm going to say this, you're nuts. Give me a drink, somebody, will you? I'm so nervous! Quiet, please! Little boys and girls of Radioland, here we are again, and here comes Aunt Jenny who's going to talk to you, sing to you and tell you some more about Oatina. Here she is, boys and girls. Good evening, my darlings. Your Aunt Jenny almost didn't get here to talk to you this afternoon. Do you remember that green dragon I was telling you about yesterday? Well, he followed me right up to the studio. He's here now, my darlings, and he brought along with him a lot of very naughty boys who are determined to spoil Aunt Jenny's program. But they won't. No, they won't. Naughty boys have often tried to tease your Aunt Jenny. Sometimes they've teased her till she had to give in, but she won't this afternoon. And do you know why? Because Aunt Jenny has a dish of lovely Oatina in her hand. I want you all to try it. You'll be surprised how it'll make you grow. And now, my darlings, it's bedtime for most of you, so Aunt Jenny is going to sing you a good night song. Baby's boat's the silver moon Sailing in the sky Sailing over the sea of sleep While the clouds float by Sail, baby, sail Out upon that sea Only don't forget to sail Back again to me Baby's boat's the silver moon Sailing in the sky I tell you, Mike, I've combed this old town. I've talked with every theatrical manager of my acquaintance, and I can't find a trace of her. Well, that may be, but a girl can't just disappear off the face of the Earth and not leave some trail behind her. You'd be surprised! I've employed hundreds of girls in my shows and all sorts of things happen to them. One out of 100 gets to the top. Some stick in the chorus and some get married and lose their identity that way. That's what I thought would be the fate of Sally Trent when she met you. At least, I hoped it would. She was a swell kid. One of the best. You know, every time I get near one of those radios, I have to listen to one of those confounded bedtime hours. Would you mind... Sure. Thanks. Mike, what happened? Well, I was just a plain fool, that's all. You see, I had to leave for China in a hurry. Instead of marrying her then and there and taking her with me, I went alone. Then, when I did write, asking her to join me, I got no reply. My letters were returned. No such person known living there. You know, I'd give anything if I could find her. I'll try again, old man. Mr. Cummings sent these letters over. All right, Dolly, that's swell. Thanks. Read them out. Sugar, looks to me like you've gotten to be famous. You bet your life. Known from coast to coast as "Everybody's Auntie!" "My dear Aunt Jenny. "My nephew and I are crazy about you on the radio. "Your voice comes over like a million dollars. "I would dearly love to meet you sometime. "Hopefully, Uncle Edgar." "Dear Aunt Jenny. Lam a little girl. "I am five years old. "I like you, Aunt Jenny. You sing pretty, too, Aunt Jenny. "Well, goodbye, Aunt Jenny. Sally." That one's kind of sweet, ain't it? Let me see. "Dear Aunt Jenny..." That's enough. Never mind. Never mind. Hello. Hello. I'm looking for a little girl named Sally. My name is Sally. What's your name? My name's Aunt Jenny. Did you get my letter, Aunt Jenny? Yes, darling. I used to have a little girl once whose name was Sally. Was she black like me, Aunt Jenny? Darling, it was so long ago, Aunt Jenny wouldn't remember. Guess what I've got here. Candy. That's right. Would you like some? Aunt Jenny, that's swell. Aunt Jenny, will you tell me a story? Yes, darling. You bet I will. Now, let's see. Once upon a time... Keep the party clean, whatever you do. Mimi! Hello! Boy, are we having fun! Listen, kids, listen. I've got to broadcast, and I'm so darned tired now. Be nice and clear out, would you? Come on, don't be like that. We want to stay! Yeah, we want to stay. All right, then stay. I don't want to seem inhospitable, but as long as you're here there'll be no broadcast. Well! Let's go down to 22. We've been put out of better places than this. That's a very good idea. Come on, everyone. Hello, Tony! Hi, Tony! Say, you'd better be careful. We just got thrown out. What's happened? What's the matter? Come on, kids. Say, how does she get that way? Where's Mimi? When they get famous, they all get that way. Never mind, forget it. We'll have a lot of fun before the day is over. Hello, Tony. What's the matter, dear? I had a shock this afternoon, Tony. One of those letters you sent over was from a little girl named Sally. Well, what about it? That was the name of my kid. All of a sudden you remember you're a mother. Well, strange as it may seem to you, I've never forgotten it. I gave her up four years ago completely and forever. Those were the conditions. I've lived up to them. But now I've got to do something about it. Tony, I didn't realize it at first, but every time I broadcast, maybe... Maybe I'm talking to my own kid. That letter today signed Sally, don't you see? I'm sorry, Mimi dear. If you're suggesting using the radio as a means of finding your child, it can't be done. It's out of the question. Well, what do you mean? Don't you understand? You're a torch singer. I'll give it up. Carlotti can find someone else to take my place. I'll tell him tonight. Even if you give it up, you're still Mimi Benton. I'm sorry, dear. I hate to be so blunt about it, but business is business. You understand that, Mimi? I see. All right, Miss Benton. That's what I am? Just a voice. All right, Tony, a contract's a contract. I'll never do anything to embarrass you, but I'm going to find my kid. And now I have a surprise for you. I don't know of anything that little girls and boys love so much as a birthday, so Aunt Jenny has plans for a birthday club. Right here on the table beside me there's a great big hat filled with hundreds of names. I'm going to close my eyes tight, and I'm going to draw the name for our first birthday club. Just a moment now. Here we are. And what name do you suppose Aunt Jenny has drawn? Sally! I want all the little girls named Sally to write in and tell me their birthdays. That's very important, and don't forget your addresses, because you're going to get a doll. Aunt Jenny's going to have a special doll made, just the loveliest doll you ever saw. And now, my darlings, I'm going to sing you a little song that I used to know a long time ago. Don't be a crybaby You've nothing to lose But the boogeyman will get you Hey, Mickey, let's go out and play. Starting to sing the blues Don't be a crybaby Whatever may be 'Cause I never will desert you Nothing's going to hurt you You can depend on me You can depend on me You can have me But you must be mine alone Give me liberty or give me love You've been kind of strange Why the sudden change? Do you want somebody new? I'd be glad to share All of your grief and care Sally! But never will lever share you I'll be all your own, dear Yours to have and hold and call your own, dear You can have me if you want me But you must be mine alone Give me liberty or give me love Mimi Benton! Give me liberty or love Where you going? Where do you think? Come in. Well, look who's here! I hear you've been away. The trip must have done you a world of good. You look simply swell. Sally. So you remember the name! Do tell me about China. It's a beautiful country, I hear. Is it so, or is it so and so? What's happened to Sally Trent? Sally Trent? Let me think. Please stop acting. You know I loved you. Oh, no! I can't believe that Michael Gardner, Boston's gift to China, could ever have loved that shabby little chorus girl. Well, I'll tell you what happened to her. While you were touring China, she went through hell! It's a nice place. You must go there someday. It's all right, Mike. I got along without you then, and I can get along without you now. Darling, listen to me. I love you a thousand times more than I ever did before. Does that mean anything to you? Yes, indeed! There's nothing this world needs so much as love, love, more love! What do we talk about now? I want to hear about you, Sally. Aren't you nice? There isn't anything a woman likes as well as talking about herself, especially when there's so much to tell. Let me see, now. Oh, yes, I changed my name. I got sick of being Sally Trent, so I switched to Mimi Benton. It's a nice name, don't you think? And then... Oh, yes, I almost forgot to tell you. I had a baby, not that you'd be interested. Yes, I had your child in a charity ward! I kept her with me until things got so bad I was afraid what might happen to her. Well, why didn't you go to my family? I thought of that, too. Miss Agatha Alden of Beacon Hill wasn't interested. So I took her back where we started, the charity ward, and signed her away just like that. Well, where is this place? You'd like to know, wouldn't you? I've got to know! Well, make the rounds. That's what I had to do before I found one that would take me in. I'm sorry, Sally. I've made a lot of rotten mistakes, but I'm trying to make up for them. The first thing I did when I got back was to try and find you. I didn't expect you to believe me, but I did hope that you'd meet me halfway. You've changed, all right. You're selfish, hard. Sure I am. Just like glass. So hard nothing will cut it but diamonds. Come around someday with a fistful, maybe we can get together. I don't see how you could have done it, Aunt Agatha. But this girl had no means of proving her claim. How was I to know... You could have taken a chance. That having failed, at least you could have cabled me. I'm glad I didn't. A girl like this Sally Trent would have ruined your life. I was in a position to save you, and I thank heaven for it. That's fine. The next time you go in for rescue work, pick out someone who wants to be saved. I don't. I love Sally Trent, and I'm going to win her back. And I'm sending you a Sally doll for your birthday. With love and best wishes, Aunt Jenny. Is that your last one? Yes, Miss Benton. Excuse me, Miss Benton, but Mr. Cummings is on the wire. Well, you take the message, Carrie. I'm busy. Did you call the express company? Yes, Miss Benton. They'll be here the first thing in the morning. Good. All right, girls, finish what you're doing and we'll call it a day. Excuse me. Mr. Seymour from the detective agency is here. Have him come in, please. All right. Hello, Mr. Seymour. How do you do? I've been waiting for you. Have you got some good news for me? Here's your check from the charity hospital. What's the matter with it? Mother Angelica won't take any more of your money. She says they're always glad to have freewill offerings, but she can't take bribes. I can't go on taking your money, either, Miss Benton. Why not? I'm not bribing you, am I? I'm not saying you are, but I can't help you anymore, see? You haven't tried very hard, I imagine. I don't lay down on any job, Miss Benton. I haven't got a ghost of a chance. What do you mean? I've turned this town upside down, and there's not a trace of your child. How do you know she's in New York? For all we know, she may be in another part of the world. For all you know, she may even be dead. Thanks for reminding me. I didn't mean it that way. I owe you a week's salary, don't I? You don't owe me anything. Yes, I do. Good night. I'm sorry. For all you know, she may be dead. Maybe he's right. Aunt Jenny! Bedtime stories! What a laugh! Carrie, give me a drink. No, no, get me my black velvet dress. What are you going to do, honey? I'm going places! Atta baby! Little boys and girls of Radioland, I have some bad news for you again. It isn't likely that Aunt Jenny will be here to talk to you tonight at 5:00 as she is still ill. However, we have every hope that tomorrow she will be with us once more. You don't seem to realize, my dear Julia, that if Miss Benton continues to hide herself we'll simply have to abandon the Oatina program. Well, I still think it's very strange, Mr. Cummings, that you can't find someone else to take this woman's place. My dear Mrs. Judson, I have had 100 women up here the last three days, each one worse than the one before. There's only one Mimi Benton. Well, that's something to be grateful for! Miss Benton needs us much worse than we need her. She's trying to make every effort to find her child. You know this Sally birthday doll idea? Why, only this morning, we received a letter from a child which... Well, it's too disgusting! To think of that disreputable woman talking every evening to America's dear little kiddies! Rats! She's an evil influence invading a million decent homes! More rats! How would you like to have such a creature in your home? I'd love nothing better! Yes? Speaking. What? They've found her. Where? 185 East. Certainly, I'll be right over. You stay right there. Okay. Come on, Juddy. Andrew Judson! Are you going in search of that dreadful woman? Yes! And if I thought you'd be of any earthly use, I'd drag you along. What? You don't know your luck. That new mink coat you have on, Mimi Benton. Those diamond earrings, Mimi Benton. And if you want to know the truth, that dreadful woman is all but keeping you! Hello, Mimi. Hi, Tony. Sit down and have a drink. Mimi, let's get out of here. No. What for? Well, I don't like this place. That's right. It's a terrible joint. I know a swell place over on... You know, over on... We'll ride around, we'll we find it. All right. Who's this guy that's got his arm around me? That's Mr. Judson. I think he's drunk. I want to sit down. Mimi, dear, we've got to get you home. What's the big idea? We've got all day, haven't we? What's the big idea? Listen, dear, I have a letter here. I know some letters. "A," "B," "cm" No, but listen. This letter is from a little girl named Sally. Sally who? Well, it's her birthday, September 2nd. It may be your little Sally. September 2nd. My Sally. Come on, Mimi dear. Pull yourself together. You've got a broadcast in less than an hour. Yeah. Yeah, I gotta. Yeah. Come on, Tony. Yeah. Taxi. Miss Benton, honey, Carrie's brought you some nice, hot, black coffee. Take just one little sip, won't you, honey? I don't want coffee. She'll never make it. Oh, yeah? What do you know about it? Good evening, little children of Radioland. Have you had your Oatina today? This evening your Aunt Elizabeth will... Miss Spaulding, just half a second, please. How much time have we got, Harry? About a minute. All right. Fine. Hold it. Give me that, Carrie. I'll take care of her. Mimi, listen to me, dear. Mimi, you're due on the air any minute. Come on, pull yourself together. Mimi, you said you'd never let me down. Now, come on. I'm trying. Mr. Cummings, we're due on the air. All right, Harry. Ready, Miss Spaulding. Little boys and girls of Radioland, I'm sorry to keep disappointing you about Aunt Jenny. She wanted us to bring the microphone to her bedside, but the doctor refused to allow it. However, I have a pleasant surprise for you. Your Aunt... Your... Your Aunt Jenny speaking. I couldn't bear to be away from you any longer, so as soon as the doctor left, I got out of bed, and here I am. Yes, darlings. I've been ill, so I can't talk to you very long, but before I say good night, I want to wish a happy, happy birthday to a little girl named Sally, whose birthday is September 2nd. I have her letter here, but there's no address. Won't Sally please call me on the telephone as soon as the broadcast is over? The number is Murray Hill, 29969. I have such a lovely doll to send, but I must have the address. Are you sure you have the number, darling? Murray Hill, 29969. And now, good night, my dears. Aunt Jenny is so glad to be back with you once more. That's all for tonight, boys and girls. I know that you are all glad to have Aunt Jenny back with you once more. So be sure, children, to tune in tomorrow at this hour for Aunt Jenny and her Oatina program. Take it easy, Mimi. Give me a cigarette, Tony. I wonder why she doesn't phone. She'll phone, dear. Maybe she won't. Maybe she's sick! Or she hasn't had time to call, dear. Hello? What? What number do you want? No, wrong number. Now, now... Tony, what if she wasn't listening in? No, I'm sure she was listening in. She was? Now, be patient, darling. Hello. Yeah? Hello? Yes, darling. Is this Sally? Now tell Aunt Jenny where you live. No, no, wait a minute, darling. I didn't hear you. Now, say it again, very slowly, will you? 85 East... Do you think you'll be all right? Sure. Good luck. Hello, Daddy. Isn't it time little girls were getting ready for bed? Not yet, Daddy. Do you know, the most wonderfulest thing happened to me today. You could never guess. Come on, tell me. Aunt Jenny's coming to this house specially to see me. Aunt Jenny? Beg pardon, sir, Aunt Jenny is here to see Miss Sally. Daddy, you can go bring her in while I fix my children. All right. Sally! Well, I guess the joke's on me. I don't know what miracle's brought you here or what all this Aunt Jenny business is, but now that you are here, I'm not going to let you go. It's no use, Mike. I didn't come here to see you. Forget me. There's a kid in there who's waiting to see you. Don't disappoint her. Mike! Yes. She's been here a week now. She belongs to me. I want to see her. Are you Aunt Jenny? Yes, darling. Hello, Aunt Jenny. I'm Sally. Hello, Sally. Don't cry, Aunt Jenny. This is my birthday. Aren't you going to kiss me? Yes, darling. Look, look at what Aunt Jenny brought you, darling. She's beautiful! Thank you, Aunt Jenny. Sally. Sally, dear! I'm coming. Miss Thomas! Look, Miss Thomas! Aunt Jenny brought me the most beautifulest doll! Isn't that nice? Come on, darling. We go to bed. Goodbye, Aunt Jenny. Goodbye, darling. Isn't she lovely? She's adorable, no thanks to me. No thanks to either of us. Don't go, darling. I've got so much to say to you. There's someone out there waiting for me. But I must talk to you. The maid says Michael Gardner lives there, sir. The club. Yes, sir. So you see, darling, she needs both of us. I'll be the best father to her I can, but I couldn't possibly be a mother to her. Could I?
