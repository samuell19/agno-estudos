For weeks, the mysterious disappearance of the Zulu diamond had baffled the authorities. With no leads and no suspects, it appeared to be the perfect crime. Throughout the city, museums and jewelers have heightened their security, as the culprits are still at large. Even the mayor's specially appointed task force has been unable to draw a deed on the masterminds behind the crime. However, in an amazing development, the case of the missing African Zulu diamond has been solved. Was it the Interpol? The FBI? No, the heroes in this mystery are "Undercover Kids." [crowd cheering] [police siren] [voice on radio] Unit One, move in. Move in! Unit Two, move to rendezvous point. Repeat,... move to rendezvous. -Did you see him? -Affirmative. -Where? That's Four Finger Freddy, allright. Wonder why they call him Four Finger Freddy? Lost a finger trying to crack a safe. He just wouldn't let go of the diamonds. Look out! That was close! Too close. I suspect he suspects. He'll wait a while to make his move. But how could he? He couldn't have seen us. Hold it right there! Hands in the air. Uh, oh. Looks like trouble. I was afraid of something like this. Nothing we can't handle. Hey, hey... I know you! You're that genius kid. Yeah, yeah... you're, ah... -George Booker. -Yeah, yeah, that's it. So what's going on? You on a case? Oh, sorry about that. Now, fill me in. We're tracking Freddy Willard. Four Finger Freddy. We almost had him tonight. Maybe you kids better leave police business to the police. Especially with Four Finger Freddy. He's on the most wanted list. -Dangerous... very dangerous. -But you see... You're right, officer. Absolutely. We're just on our way home. Yeah. Why don't you kids move along? Whoa! -George Booker? -The one and only. -Maggie Kline, For... -Fortune Made magazine. I know. Pleasure. What's she doing here? Yeah, what are you doing here? I've been following you for days. I was hoping for an interview? You've been following me for days? You bet! -Well -Well, she's gonna have to swear to secrecy if we're gonna let her in. What if she tells somebody? I... I won't tell. Cross your heart? Cross my heart. Let's go. -Clear! -Clear! Hey! I'll watch my post outside. We've had movement on the Sunshine school case. Go on, what happened? The basketball team discovered all the equipment missing. Assign agents 333 and 467 to this case. Done. I've got the security monitors up... so if Four Fingers goes anywhere near that building, we'll know about it. Kevin will radio if there's anything the camera doesn't get. So, what has this Four Fingers guy done? He hasn't done anything yet. The museum's restoring a very valuable painting in the warehouse across the street. We got a tip that Four Fingers might swipe the painting. If we catch him in the act, we can put him away. That's what I wanted to interview you about. How you started the Undercover Kids Detective Agency and all the details. Where should we start? The beginning is always good. Funny enough, a vandalism case started the whole agency. Grandpa!Grandpa! Hey guys, c'mon, let's get this stuff out of the car. Everybody grab a load. C'mon, move it. That's when I first spotted the twins and their sister Susan. So, you were spying? Well, I don't like to call it spying. Let's just say I was... investigating. That's when you realized the twins were telepathi? Amazing. When they started that first day of school... I'm sure they never knew how important reading each o ther's minds would be. What about Susan? She was doing her best to take care of the twins...but ... she also needed to find a job. [burping] Nelson! Sorry... You should know better. And don't egg him on, Nick. What did I do? You know very well what you did. Hey, why don't you guys go upstairs and get your rooms straightened out? I'm not finished yet. Well, then take it with you. -They're really something. -Yeah, they are. And Nelson is gonna eat you out of house and home. Don't worry. I'm just glad you're here. Thanks for having us, grandpa. We couldn't stay with all the memories... and Dad's pension would only last us so far. But as soon as I get a job, we'll get our own place. I'm proud of you, Susan. It can't be easy starting your own career as a big city reporter, then having to move home to take care of the twins after the accident. Not many young people would step up the way you have, Susie. Well, we're family. That's way more important than any career. And besides, I still have to win the Pulitzer. It's only a matter of time. You know, you can stay for as long as you like. You know, you might regret saying that. This isn't going to be easy. They're very close. I mean, there's times when even I feel left out. It's almost as if they have a language of their own. can you go any faster? You want me to get it right, don't you? All right, jacks or better to open. And no cheating. How many do you want? Three... no, two... No, three... Four! How many? Four. I want four. You don't have an ace, so you can't have four. Nelson! I told you, no cheating! Who says I'm cheating? You knew I didn't have an ace. You're not supposed to use your powers during a game. Lucky guess. Let's start over. No way! I have a good hand. I know. You're cheating too. C'mon, how many cards do you want? I wanna start over. I'm not giving up this hand. Let's just promise: no more cheating. Yeah, sure. I don't wanna play anymore. Okay, I promise. No more mind reading. It's just so hard to turn it off sometimes. Twin telepaths... awesome. What are the odds? Give it up, Nelson! Watch out, Nelson! You're gonna trip! These twins are really something! Goodnight, Nicole! Goodnight, Nelson! 'Night, Susie! Goodnight, Grandpa! Goodnight, Susie! Goodnight, Grandpa. Don't let the bedbugs bite. Goodnight, Susie! Goodnight, sweetie! Goodnight, turkey brain! Goodnight, frog face! Goodnight, sports fans! 'Night, Dad...'Night, Mom. Goodnight, everybody. Hi, I'm Susan Moore. I just moved here. Hi, I'm Ms. Moore. I'm here to apply for the job. Hi! I'm Susan Moore, but you can call me Susie. Ladies first. You're no lady, you're my sister. Okay, the perfect interview outfit. Look professional. Where'd you get that outfit? Something wrong with it? All right, checklist? Got it. Notebooks? -Nick?...Nicole? -Huh? -Will you take your headphones off and listen to me, please? Come on, Susie! It's Courtney Willow, and she's singing my favorite song. I don't care who it is. Take them off and listen to me. Do you have your notebooks? Yes. Pens and pencils? Checking. Lunch money? Checking. -Homeroom numbers? -Check. And anything else in the world you would possibly need for the first day of school? -Check. -Alrigh, when we get there you guys go to your homeroom and I'm gonna go to the principal's office to make sure eveything is a-ok. -Check. Now, you guys are going to be okay to walk home from school, right? Yes! Susie said things were going to be different here. Guess she was wrong. Janet, have you got the police on the phone? Tell them to get right over. -Excuse me, but...are you...? -Peter Vaughn! What are you doing here? I work here. Principal. Wow, what a surprise. It's been so long. Yes, I think you were about...this tall. Well, time flies. So, what brings you to Monroe? I'm actually enrolling my brother and sister. So, what's going on here? Why are the police coming over? Well, we've had a little disturbance. It's nothing. Sorry to hear about your parents, Susie. Your dad and I were really close in school. Thank you, Peter. It was a big shock to all of us. Look, I promise I'll keep an eye on the twins for you. Thank you, although...frankly, they're pretty good at keeping an eye on each other. So anyway, what was that disturbance you were talking about? Vandalism. Yeahh...probably just a prank, But we want to nip this in the bud before it snowballs. Well, I should be going. I've got a lot of pavement to pound. I'm job hunting. Good luck. Hey, if I hear of anything, I'll be sure to let you know. Great. Thank you. Susan was right. Things really were going to be different here. And Nelson found out what it's like to be the new kid on the block. Hey, moron. Watch where you're going. I'm sorry, I was just... Being a moron? -You know what I got here? -No. I got a ticket to an "A," my friend. Has all the answers to the test. I see you've found yourself a willing customer, Premo. -But...this isn't what it looks like. -Save it for the principal. I guess defiling school property wasn't enough for you, huh Premo? now, you boys all look like you could use a little exercise. I'll see you, all four of you losers in the gym at lunch time. Who is he? The gym teacher, Mr. Munson. But we call him munster, like the cheese. Don't be a hero, man. Beautiful work, eh? Yeah. You're a real artist. Not me, man. But I'd personally like to shake the dude's hand. You really didn't do it? No, but I might as well have. I get blamed for everything. But, you were trying to sell me that cheat sheet. No, we were just messing with you, man, 'cause you're the new kid. Truth is, that test isn't any good. No teacher is going to use the same test as last year. [blowing whistle] That bad? You're next! Get your behind into the principal's office! And the rest of you ladies, move it! And get that banner off the wall... so the custodian doesn't have to clean up everything. Let's move! [blowing whistle] Nelson realized that Tony was innocent. It was just a matter of how to prove it. [door bell] -Hi, I'm here to drop this off for Mr... -Michael? Susie? I didn't know you were back in town. I just moved in temporarily with my grandfather. My parents were, um... there was an accident and I had to move back from New Yorkto take care of the twins. Oh, I'm... I'm sorry to hear that. Thanks. We'll be okay. So, where are you headed? The Morning Star, actually. I heard they are hiring a junior reporter and... I really need a job! I know it's not much, but I was the editor of my school paper... and I did the Stanley Pierce You're hired!journalism... -Hired for what? -The reporter. I'm the editor-in-chief... Susie, I own the paper. Nelson, you were on the honor's list at your previous school. Why would you risk ruining it all by doing something stupid like this? I was just looking for my History classroom and I bumped into these guys. So you're saying you were at the wrong place at the wrong time? Exactly! All right, Nelson. I'm gonna to let it go this time because of your exemplary record and as a favor to your sister. Just make sure this doesn't happen again. Thank you, sir. So, how's uh... how's your sister Susan settling in? She's all right... I guess. Good... good. Uhm... If you ever need anything, my door's always open. Nelson, close the door behind you. I can't... I won't work like this! The costumes must be perfect! We can't work like this! No, we can't! Everything has to be right. Who was that? Stella Lawrence, the drama teacher. That's drama, all right. As in drama queen. So, what do you wanna do? I think those guys are getting blamed for something that they didn't do, just like I was. Premo's actually kinda cool. Well, you know, we don't really know what we're doing. Sure we do. We'll just do what Dad would've done. Well, that's three nothing. You have to remind me? Are you good at everything? It comes naturally. The twins needed a plan of action, so they made a pact to clear Tony's name. Water-based. Keep the can. Let's move on. Gotcha. I was just thinking the same thing. Meet you there. I found this in the bathroom. Our vandals didn't mean to do permanent damage. If they had, they would have used oil-based paint, not water-based paint. What's next on the list? Let's go check out where they broke in. See anything incriminating? No... wait a second... What's this? What? It's a... footprint. Take a picture! We need... a camera. Looks like a sneaker print. There's an impression on it, but I can't quite make it out. Maybe we can blow it up and then read it. What's next? Motive. Sorry, Sherlock. We've got to put this investigation on hold. Grandpa's not going to be happy if we're late for dinner. [undistinguished talk] It's Susie! You don't think he called her in about me, do you? Shh... I'm trying to hear what she's saying. Well, a lot of the kids are mad, Susan. These extracurricular activities are important to them. With the budget cuts, those activities are likely to disappear. So they're lashing out with vandalism. Well, it's just a theory. Any other theories? Well, there is the handful of obvious suspects. Such as? Well, Tony Premo, for one. Underneath the leather he's a good kid, but, ah... it's not unlikely he's behind the trouble. [coughing] What was that? It's not Tony. It has to be an inside job. You heard him say how mad the kids were. Their clubs might get cut from the school budget. Mad enough trash the school?to... But how do we find out which club did it? We go undercover... ...like Dad used to. And we'll join all the clubs and find out which one was mad enough to vandalize the school. I like the way you think. You're just saying that 'cause I can read your thoughts. And you think you're brilliant. You know, if Mr. Vaughn squealed... and told Susie what happened... she's gonna kill you. I'm innocent, totally innocent. I'll take a lie detector test! George! George, can you hear me? I want you here right now! Be down there in a second. Not your second, young man, my second. Now! Okay, okay! Nelson, Nelson, come here! What's wrong? Peeping Tom. Over there on the balcony. You wish. I'm serious. So what should we do? We're gonna go over there and talk to him. We? I want you to take this down the block for Dr. Moore's family. It's... not a pot roast, is it? What's wrong with my pot roast? Uhh... Wuh... well...Speechless, huh? We just thought we'd drop in on our new... Pervert. What? I'm not a pervert. Funny, but you look like one. I'm not. Really. What was that telescope on the balcony? That was you spying on me. Well, yes... but it wasn't spying. It was a... a scientific investigation. Right, so you're a scientist, huh? Well, you must be the twins from down the block. How nice of you to stop by. I was just going to send George over with a nice pot roast. Maybe we could use him. Yes Ma'am. We were just going to introduce ourselves to your son. Our grandfather told us all about him. Well, isn't that nice... George, why don't you show them your bedroom? -We'd love to see it. -Well then, come on in! Caught in the act. How embarrassing. I can't believe she thought I was a... a... well, you know. What was your first impression of the twins? Well... Nicole was cute. I mean for a girl. Anyway, they were working on this case. And they asked you to help. Nicole thought I could be their secret weapon. Awesome! I can't believe this place. Amazing. Are you really in college? Uh huh. So you're pretty smart... for a pervert. I'm not a pervert. I was just... curious. Curiosity killed the cat. I don't have a cat. So you're some kind of genius, huh? I guess... Soda anyone? Sure! It's a little invention of mine. And you won't need ice because Herbie here keeps the liquids at precisely 47 degrees Fahrenheit, or if you're on the Celsius scale... You know, if you're so smart, maybe you can help us with something. Well, there's this thing at school. We're conducting an investigation. Someone's been vandalizing the school with graffiti. And Nelson thinks the wrong people are being blamed. -I'll help. -We think it might have something to do with the school budget cuts and that one of the school clubs might be involved. You can be our secret weapon. Sure. And I'm... not a pervert. Okay, you're not a pervert but maybe you should aim that telescope in a different direction from now on. [knock on door] What's he doing here? I don't know. Don't worry. Hey kids. This is Mr. Vaughn. Actually, uh, Nelson and I have already met. Oh really? Yes, uh... I introduced myself to him just to welcome him to our school. Hmm, good. I thought you were going to say he was already in trouble. -Gotta go. -Good night. -Did you want to come in? -No, thanks. I don't have time. Uh, but I do have good news. Guess what reporter's going to be covering the school board meeting? Me? Really? Yes. I talked to the board this morning and they all agreed. Thank you so much. This is going to give such an edge to my article. Well, like I said, anything I can do. I'll see you there. Thank you so much. Trying to impress her new boss, Susan was hot on the trail of the vandals too. She just didn't know the twins were ahead of her. I've drawn up a list of the clubs than can potentially be cut from the school budget. We'll split up and join each club. Are you listening? How's this for Chess Club? Convincing? Photography Club ? Hey, uh, Courtney Willow. She's uh... quite a performer. You know I taught her that dance step? No way! No, huh... really. How can you possibly know Courtney Willow? Well, I met her in New York City when we were there with the CIA cracking the computer code. George, Courtney Willow cracking codes? She's...quite smart, really! Are you thinking what I'm thinking? I always do. He's too young looking for junior high. I'm afraid I have to agree. But he does have nice hair. Remember when Dad took us to work with him? Why couldn't George come to school with us? You know, in some cultures, people are married by our age. He could be our cousin visiting from New York. Okay, Brainiac, what subjects are you good at? Actually, all of them. Except sports. Oh, don't worry. I've got athletics covered. Of course, I'm fluent in all the Romance languages. What about DOW? What does that stand for? DOW. It could be someone's initials. Or an abbreviation for something like... the Dow Jones average. Could be the Investment Club. I'd hate to break up this brainstorming session... Or brainless session, as the casemay be... but I have to study my astronomy if I'mgoing to join their club. I've got a better idea. The plan was to go undercover? Yes. Pretending to be their cousin, visiting from New York. I heard Courtney Willow was involved. She's pretty famous. Nelson didn't believe me at first, but I really am friends with Courtney Willow. As her first CD was making it to the Top Ten... we were in Washington together helping crack a code for the FBI. How'd you meet? Well, we graduated college together when I was eight. I agreed to help, of course, and I had taken a real interest in Nicole. Uh, I..I mean for scientific reasons, of course. Wow...The sky in Chicago was never like this. It's so beautiful. So many stars. Breathtaking.. Cold? Is that the Big Dipper? No, Sirius. Yeah I'm serious. Is that the Big Dipper? Oh, I mean..it's the constellation Sirius. It's in the shape of a dog. and..there's its tail and... there's its head. Oh yeah! I see it now. George!...Bedtime! Oh yeah. I forgot. You're only ten. Well... when I'm eighteen, you'll be twenty-one. But that's years from now. I can wait. What's that? Oh, it's a... it's a special lock. It's also an alarm, see? If someone even touches it, it broadcasts a special signal to me. And this starts to vibrate and lets me know when something's wrong. Let's see. And if someone tries to steal the bike... there's a special camera in the lock and it'll take their picture... and it'll transmit it to a docking station in my room and onto my computer. Of course, there's a mini-camera in the pen. That's amazing. Oh, it's nothing. Does it write? Of course... It also contains a tiny digital microchip that has the capacity to record for five minutes. It also works like a pager, complete with silent vibration... Awesome! Nelson, give it back. I could provide one of these for both of you, if you'd like. We'd like. All right, boys, enough with the toys. Let's get down to business. First we'll go into Mr. Vaughn's office, get a note and then you'll go to classes with me. Now remember, you're our cousin from New York. Got it, chief. Don't call me chief. You can call me chief. Wow!... These are all your inventions? Yes. I've created a whole line: SPIES LIKE US. What's there? It's the drama club theater. I'm gonna go check it out. What are you doing? Hey guys: DOW strikes again. [alarm beeping] Excuse me. It's Courtney calling me back. As in Courtney Willow? Uh, hello? Hey, George! I got your message. I miss you. How are you? Oh, I'm in school.. Middle school. Middle school? What are you talking about? George, you're in college, remember? Long story. Where are you? I'm in New York... I'm cutting a new album and I'm getting ready for a performance right now. Oh, cool. Cutting a new CD? Uh, listen, I know someone who would really like a signed copy. Sure, no problem... Wait, this new friend... wouldn't be a girl, would it? Well, yes... yes she is. I'm jealous, George. Now, what's this about a new code? It's a new case we're working on. I'll e-mail you all the details. We really need your help. Sure, George. No problem... Uh, I've got to run. The show's starting. Um, but e-mail me all the details. I'd love to help if I can. We're in. She'll help if she can. Was that really Courtney Willow? C'mon, George. Quit fooling around. No, really. It was. Do you ever have a problem being a college graduate at eight years old? Actually, it's not always a good thing. I trust you all studied the world capitals we learned yesterday. Yes, Mr.... Mr.... Booker. I'm George Booker. I'm visiting. Okay, what do you do, Mr. Booker? Well, I wasn't here yesterday, so I didn't have the assignment. Just do the best you can. Okay, who can tell me what the capital of Belgium is? -Brussels! -Your hand, Mr. Booker, please, raise your hand and I will call on you. Okay, who can tell me what the capital of Japan is? -Mr. Booker? -Tokyo. Yes. Italy?... Mr. Booker. -Rome! -Yes. Peru? Mr. Booker? Lima. Very good. Spain? Mr. Booker Madrid. Yes. Greece? [applauding] Excuse me... Yeah. I'm here to try out for the team. Don't I know you? Well, sort of. Yeah, you're the kid that was hanging out with Premo. Son, if I were you, I'd find myself a new set of friends. well, I thought if maybe I joined the team... Well, you're a day late and a few inches too short, sonny. I'm not that short. Besides, have you ever heard of a player named Mugsy Bogues? Yeah, I used to play with him. Really? -Nah, I'm just kidding. So, how about it? Let's see what you can do. [laughing] Do you really think they're gonna cut the JV squad, Coach? Nobody's gonna cut one penny from my team. Not if I can help it. Did I make the team? Nelson, that's your name, right? Well Nelson, in all my years of coaching, I have never, ever, seen anybody... and believe me, I've seen a lot... who was a worse basketball player than you are. oh, you know, that leaves a lot of room for improvement. But, I like your spirit. So I'll tell you what I'm gonna do. I'm gonna give you a very important position. You are going to be my new team manager. Sorry. I got caught up at basketball tryouts. I had to fluff and fold. -What? -It's a long story. But I think the coach and some players might be involved. What makes you think that? Just a feeling. I heard them talking about the budget cuts. Where's George? Last call. Is any one of you N. Moore? That's me. Nicole. Let's go. Meet your opponent, Vladimir Bornikov. Excuse me, I have to go to the bathroom. Sit down. You don't suppose I can get a glass of... water? No. Get started. Oops! What took you so long? I had to go home and get my board. Well, hurry up. She can't stall much longer. You'll have fifteen minutes to play the game. Ms. Moore will take white, Mr.Bornikov, black. Shake hands and start the clock. She's white. Good. White opens. The Sicilian Defense opening. He'll never see it coming. Remember, she needs to think of the chessboard as a battlefield. First, bring out your troops. The pawns are your foot soldiers. Don't attack until your king is safe. Watch it, your queen's under attack. Force the black king to abandon the bishop. Bishop! Queen! Checkmate! Game to the new... member, Nicole Moore Don't be too hard on yourself, Bornikov. Brainiac, we did it! She's in! Excuse me... Are you... Yes?Stella Lawrence? Yes I am, dear. Stella Lawrence in the flesh. Now, what movie do you recognize me from? Or perhaps one of my Broadway plays. Don't be shy, dear, tell me your favorite. Actually, my name is Susan Moore and I'm a reporter for the Morning Star. I was wondering if I could talk to you about the budget cuts. I will not discuss it. I'm an artist! I mean, imagine having to adjust to these conditions. Well, do you think the recent rash in vandalism is somehow related to the potential budget cuts? I mean the vandalism is obviously the work of some kids with too much time on their hands. I have my ideas about that. And that would be... What? Um... your ideas. Oh, well... the sports team, of course!, I mean... who else has time to throw around some dumb ball trying to hit a basket? Now, are you worried that the Drama Club funding will somehow be cut back in order to fund the sports teams? Impossible! Our work is so much more important! I will tell you one thing... Okay....and that would be? They will never, never defeat us. Viva la art! Stella Lawrence, the Drama teacher, she really believes she's a star. Her drama club means everything. Susan was poking around determined to get to the bottom of the mystery. -Well? -Meet the first substitute on the Monroe Junior High Debate Team. May I remind you that you don't even go there. Oh, yeah. So, did you find out anything? well, there was some talk of the graffiti, but I took the liberty of bringing... this. What's that? It's a portable stress analyzer, otherwise known as a lie detector. It shows if anyone is under stress when they're speaking... and according to this, which never lies, no one in the whole group knows anything about who did it. Band practice next. Did you hear about the school cuts affecting band? I don't care. The only reason I'm even is because my mom said I had to do something after school. Who's that? That's Premo... They're awesome! * Uh, Uh, I'm like a junior, but I'm still in Junior High * * They call me Premo, 'cause I'm like Super Fly * * They wanna blame me every time the school gets trashed * * It's like insane beat hear me out, that's all I ask * * Me and my crew we 'aint into graffiti...* * We just throw down lyrics to fresh crazy beaties * * Some think that we be just nerds, jocks and geekies * * We've got the rhymes to make you all super freaky * * I'm just a kid, y'all, and they want to rough me up? * * It's totally wack, they want to bust me up? * * Talking 'bout what is art, and what is not * * What about justice? Hey, you all forgot * * We got a bad reputation we do not deserve * * So I'm making fresh rhymes that you never, ever heard * * I know, I know, I don't get good grades, But "Fs" don't make us all renegades. * Suspension. Detention. Verbal extensions * * Vandalous. Scandalous. Dishonorable mention * * We won't stop. 'Till you all hear us out, uhh * * That's what it's all about, school's out * Uh, oh... Hey, we got a spy here. What should we do with her? Isn't she one of those new kids? It's Nelson's sister. She's cool. Sorry to interrupt. Your group is awesome. Gotta go. Not so fast!... Everyone raps here. Oh no... I don't know how. C'mon, just be yourself. I'll start you off. * My name's Nicole, the new kid on the block... * * My name is Nicole, the new kid on the block * * But you still can't believe the kind of rhymes I drop * * Me and Nelson my twin, also known as my double * * Just whammin, trying, to stay out of trouble * Later! All right. Don't be a stranger. Dear George. Wish you were here. Got all the details... It could be any one of the clubs. Breaking the code is the key. Solve what DOW stands for and we've got our case. I just got a new code breaking program and I'm running the possibilities. The hard evidence leads to the jocks. But wait... why is it so obvious? I'm beginning to think that they're being framed. More later, Courtney. [knock on door] Twenty minute warning, Ms. Willow. Ha, thanks Jason. Wow, cocoa, Thanks. All comes with the territory. You know, stakeouts and all. We have to keep ourselves comfortable. Any sign of him? No, not yet. Should we call it a night? -He'll be back. -Back to my post. So Courtney was trying to break the code DOW. Yeah, it was so cool. Even though she was performing, she made time. Now, she started to feel that the jocks were being set up. Set up? Framed. Nelson went undercover and joined the basketball team Well, he tried. Hey. Hey, how was work? It's good. How was school? The usual. You know, I'm covering a story on vandalism. You don't know anything about that, do you? Who me? No, not a thing. Hey, where's Nicole? She's at school. Something with the photography club. Well, she better not be late. Jeez, sometimes you can be more strict than Mom was. Hey... I miss her too. You know my boss is coming over in a little bit, so, ah, behave. Okay? Do you like him? Yeah, I like him. What do you mean by that? Is he your boyfriend? Like I said, behave. "Stop investigating or you'll be sorry" Wasn't she scared? There's an element of danger in our line of work. The twins knew that and were wiling to take risks. I really liked the article. You know, we bumped you from the third page to the second. Yeah, I saw that. Thank you. So tell me, how's the school story coming? Good. The, ah, school board meeting is soon, and they'll decide the budget cuts. Poor kids. You know, that's a no-win situation. Someone's gonna lose out. Yeah, but I feel like there's something more. More? So you don't think it's just a few kids trying to cause trouble? I don't feel like that. It seems like someone is really trying to put a message through with this graffiti. I'm starting to think the vandalism is actually tied to the budget cuts. You know, it sounds like you're on to something. Maybe... Well, I guess I should be going. Uh... okay. Unless... Yeah? Would you like to grab a slice of pizza with me? Sure. What about the kids? Why don't we bring them along? Ah, actually, I already made them something here. And besides, they're up to something. Something secretive and I'm not sure what it is yet, but you can bet I will find out. Susan still didn't know the twins were working on the case? No way. She's a good reporter, though... She knew something fishy was going on. So we're pretty sure it's not Astronomy, Debate, or Photography. So, what's the verdict on Chess Club? Those chess geeks don't think about anything but checks and checkmates. First, most of the clues point to Sports. We've got the sneaker footprint and the sports-related graffiti. And messages like... FOUL PLAY...NO PAY, NO PLAY. Check this out. They're on to us. Oops. We won't be scared off that easy. We won't? Now I want to break this case more than ever. Take a look at this... It's a footprint. Looks like a sneaker. Probably belongs to some jock. Not that! It's a... Pin! Not just any pin. It's a JV Knights basketball pin. Wow!...looks like we've got our culprits. Wait! I received an e-mail from Courtney today. She's convinced someone is trying to frame the jocks. The evidence against them is purely circumstancial. Shouldn't we continue our investigation until we've eliminated all the possible suspects? He's right. We've got two more clubs left, Art and Drama. Nelson, you take Art. But I'm an athlete. I can't draw. -We'll just have to use... -The Power. Hi. My name is Nelson and I'd like to join the Art Club. Well, we aren't really taking any new members right now. But I just love art, and I'm new here. Well, you'll have to pass a drawing test. I could do that. What's happening? Shh. I'm trying to concentrate. Well, if you would have let me mike him, you wouldn't have to. That wouldn't have worked. A horse? That's right. How about a car? I can draw a really nice car. Then perhaps you ought to move to Detroit and get a job designing automobiles. But what I would like to see is a horse. Okay, Nelson. Here we go. Follow my hand. Very nice, Mr. Moore. Very nice. I must say I'm surprised. You're obviously gifted. So I'm in? -I don't see why not. -Cool! My sketch pad. Art's always the first to go. All that matters to these suits is reading, writing and arithmetic. It makes me crazy! I mean, these kids need to understand art. They need music, they need drama!... And the Drama Club has swiped all of our paint again. We're completely out! Forgot my sketch pad. We just got started, what happens if they cut the budget? Yeah, how are we gonna show coach that we're good enough to make the varsity? My dad's really angry. He says we ought to do something about it. Maybe get everyone to sign a petition. That's not gonna work. Joey says that if they cut the JV squad, he's gonna transfer to River View. Are you kidding me? He's our best player. I know. He doesn't want to. He told Eric that if... You'll never guess what I just heard. See you at the park. Four o'clock. -It's a date. -It's a date. You know the little dude's got a major crush on you. We're just gonna study for an English test. So, how do you think you did on your tests? I think I aced it. I wonder. I'd ace all my tests too if I had a cheat sheet. Uh, I didn't cheat. Cheater. Moore, did you take care of those towels yet? Uh, yes Mr. Munster... Munson. What's that, Mr. Moore? Uh, it's nothing. Just a class assignment. You're not smuggling contraband in the school, are you? No, sir. I certainly hope not. Oh, Tony...Hi! -Hi. -What's up? Just wanted to warn you... Someone's out to get you. Me? Why?... What's that? It's a note you wrote saying Mary Davis has been making out with me. She's not too happy about it. I didn't write any note. Let me see it. This isn't even my writing. I wouldn't spread rumors about anyone. That's what I thought. But I just wanted to warn you. Thanks. Why do you care? I know what it's like to be accused of something that you didn't do. Think I don't know about the whole school saying I'm the creep who's painted the graffiti? I don't. Really? Really. I know you didn't do it. And me and Nelson are trying to prove it. You are? You're doing that for me? Yeah. We're getting really close to breaking the case. Cool. Peter, hi. You look busy. -Yeah, school board meeting stuff. -Yeah. I know...that's actually why I'm here too... I wanna get the right angle on this article. Do you have any idea yet of what'll be cut? No... Off the record? Yeah, of course. I haven't come up with a solution yet. Something's going to have to go. It's just a matter of what. Do you have any idea of what yet? C'mon, off the record. Okay. Investigating the vandalis... it'sstarting to look like the basketball team had something to do with it. -And? -Ah, if that's the case, I really have no choice... They would be first in line for the cut. Well, I hope you're wrong. There's got to be some other solution here. Too conservative. Loser. You the man! Hey, George. Shall we? Coffee? Coffee? Don't you have any sodas? I'm having a test on this tomorrow. Shakespeare is so medieval. Um, you'll probably be quizzed on the basics, uh, character, plot, key phrases. Phrases? I'm dead. Here's a trick that'll help. First, write down the phrase. Then circle the first letter in each word and memorize the initials. "Beware the Ides of March." B.I.M - B, I, M BIM...see? Let me try. Dogs of War. D.O.W. DOW! So... DOW is... The Drama Club. They're more likely to get cut from the budget... than any of the sports teams. Didn't Nelson say that the Drama Club was raiding art supplies from the Art room? To use it to write their messages. What about the clues that lead to the basketball team? To make it look like the jocks did it. They couldn't resist leaving their signature. Courtney was right. Dogs of War. The jocks were framed. No one's gonna believe it unless we have proof. We have to tell Nelson fast. There's the school board meeting tonight. Someone tried to get me in trouble by planting a cheat sheet in my locker. Tony said someone's been trying to spread rumors about me. Ha, it's obvious, they know we're on the case. So... what've we got so far? It's either the Art Club, the Drama Club, or the jocks. And I vote drama. So what do we do now? We've gotta get home. Susie's expecting us. We've gotta go to the drama rehearsal. We can't. They're already on to us. We'll just gather up the evidence and bring it to the meeting. But...I could... See you later, George! See you later, George! Call it intuition... I had a feeling that all of our answers were around that drama club. I took a chance. Nicole and Nelson had to go home. Imagine their surprise seeing Courtney Willow in the flesh. It's Courtney Willow! Let's go! Courtney!Courtney! Hey, um, I was looking for George... but he's not home oh, He's gonna be be glad to see you. [laughing] You must be the friend George was telling me about. I can't believe it's really you. I have all your CDs. Thanks. Uh, have you seen George? I think I solved the case. It's... The Drama Club! We know. We just don't have the proof. So, when's the school board meeting? It's in a couple of hours. We were going to gather the evidence and bring it to the meeting. You can stay at our place. Okay. Thanks. Coast is clear... I'm moving in! Start the fight. Dreadful acting! Stop! Stop! Ohh! You're all giving me a headache. Twenty minute break! You, you...come with me. Did you take care of the twins? We did exactly like you said. First, we planted the cheat sheet in his locker. Then we started a rumor about the girl. No one will believe them even if they do talk. Good girls. You'll get what I promised: starring roles in next season's play. Remember, all the world's a stage and we're just players. Those ridiculous sports teams gobble up all the money we deserve. Artists always suffer. Not this time. Because this is what, girls? War. And what are we? The dogs of war! Show those jocks team spirit. [loud thump] Mr. Smith... You're working late? Hey, wait a minute... you're not the janitor. Uh, he's out sick. Gotta go. Bye! I told you little idiots to get rid of the evidence. I was tired. It's hard spraypainting all those walls. Hey! It's the genius kid! Child prodigy, actually. What are we going to do? My parents will find out. I'll go to jail. Shut up! No one's going to believe him! I'm head of the Monroe Jr. High Drama Department! Stella Lawrence is a legend here! Still, he does present a slight problem. At least until the school board meets tonight. Your performance as a janitor was very unconvincing. An actor needs to immerse himself in the role. Ow! What are you doing? Where... were's the light? Our little hero's not afraid of the dark, is he? Don't. Please... or I'll... I'll... Tell? So you figured out we're the dogs of war. No one'll believe you. Besides, I'm the big dog here. Woof! Help! Someone, please! Get me out of here! Help! C'mon, think, think... Yeah, let's see... ...C'mon, Nelson! [alarm beeping] George is in trouble. What's happening? George went under deep cover. He must have been busted. Let's go! C'mon! Hurry up! In our business, we have a saying: "the gig's up." That's how I felt. Fortunately, my pen worked perfectly as a homing device, leading Nicole straight to me. [beeping continues] This way. As you can see, we have no choice. Something has to be cut from the budget. Extracurricular activities, clubs, band, sports. Unfortunately, half of these have to go. Tonight we'll be voting on which clubs are going to be cut. -Nicole, Nelson, what are you doing here? -We know who the vandals are! Kids, we're having a big meeting here now. Let's talk after the meeting. Wait, listen. You have to listen to her. -Wait a minute, aren't you... -Susie, it's Courtney Willow! DOW stands for Dogs of War. "Cry havoc and let slip the dogs of war!" It's from Shakespeare. Don't you see? The Dogs of War, D.O.W. It's the Drama Club! It's their signature! Who's signature? Hers!...She's the big dog behind all this. So sorry to be late. Rehearsals, you know. Oh, Peter, you're looking handsome as ever. Dolores, what a lovely dress! Stella, these children are claiming that you're involved in the vandalism. ha ha ha! They're just mad 'cause they weren't cast in my play. No stage presence. Are we getting on with this meeting or not? I have some rather upsetting news regarding our athletic teams... Okay, kids. Let's go. Move it along. Wait! I've got proof. I taped her confessing to everything. -Let them talk. -Yeah, leave them alone. I'm a reporter for the Morning Star. This is news. I think the taxpaying citizens of Monroe have a right to hear both sides of the story. I agree. Let the kids speak. What could it hurt? We found these in the auditorium. They match the graffiti that's been painted around the school. See that signature? That's Miss Lawrence. That's ridiculous. Anyone could have copied those sketches from the wall. I understand your sister is an accomplished artist. I have to agree. It's all circumstancial evidence. There's no proof they were drawn by Miss Lawrence. -No, Wait, there's more. We really do have proof. -We taped her confessing to everything. C'mon, George. Everyone's waiting. It must have dropped it off somewhere. -Oh no, George! -Wait a minute. Didn't you say that your pen was connected to mine? So we must have a back-up copy, right? The battery's dead. So they didn't believe you? Of course not. After all, we're just kids, right? Except Susan. She stood up for us. Told them that they had to listen to us. And once again... my pen saved the day. All I needed to find... Excuse me, but is that the digital 305 Ultrasound Hearing Aid? Yeah. May I borrow it? A hearing aid? "Those ridiculous sports teams gobble up all the money we deserve. Artists always suffer" - Not this time! Because this is what, girls?" -War!" -"And what are we?" -"The Dogs of War!" Surely you don't believe these school children. I'm Stella Lawrence! I will not be dragged off like some hooligan. Stella Lawrence appeared on Broadway! Actually, it was off-Broadway. A bit part. [crowd laughing] Fine, cast me to the wolves... Not one of you cretins ever had one drop of talent anyway. I'm a victim of the time, Joan of Arc of the Arts. Burn me at the stake! Don't be such a drama queen, Stella. [laughing] All right, people. Show's over. Back to business. I guess that clears up the mystery behind the vandalism. Unfortunately, we still have the budget cuts to deal with. Some of the clubs will still have to go. I'm gonna need one of those. Done. So I guess the mystery was solved, but the budget problem wasn't? Actually... we had a plan for that too. [music video playing] It's so cool that you offered to share your proceeds from your new CD to help the school. Hey, I'm just glad I could help. Help? You saved us jocks. Yeah, sure... You're the super athlete. It was fun helping to solve the mystery. And don't forget George. Yeah. None of this could have happened without him. To George. You kids all right? -What's up? -Nothing. Sgt. Ferguson just called and mentioned that there was some... ancient artifact that was stolen from the museum, so... I'm gonna go try and cover the story. It's nothing for you kids to concern yourselves with, though. All's well that ends well. And the twins?... What happened to Nicole and Nelson? Agents 202 and 204. [siren alarm] Red alert, red alert. He's back Move out. Where are you going? With you, of course! No way. She's a girl. It's too dangerous. But we're wasting time. Fine but... stay back. So, are you gonna get him? No, we have to wait 'till he breaks in. What if he gets away? He won't. You'll see. Good job, guys... cool! So it was another successful case solved for the undercover kids.
