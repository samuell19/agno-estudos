CJ ENTERTAINMENT PRESENTS EXECUTIVE PRODUCER JEONG TAE-SUNG A CJ ENTERTAINMENT DASAEPO CLUB PRODUCTION PRODUCER SEO YOUNG-HEE Although based on a true story, some of the events and characters have been fictionalized for dramatic purposes. Jean Do-yeon Ko Soo Paris Orly Airport Ma'am. Ma'am. Ma'am. Way Back Home April, 2004 You made a wrong turn, mister. Honey, can you pass the scanner? Scanner? I crushed a spider. Can you hurry up? Maybe you should ask Mundo to come tomorrow instead. But why? They say killing a spider in the morning brings bad luck to your guests. He hasn't visited us in years. Besides, he's no guest to us. He's right. I'm no guest to you. Mundo! Hola! How've you been, man? It's been so long. Jeongyeon? Long time. This is the real stuff. So, Suriname's where you've been for the last 3 years? That's right. Did you really find gold? It's nothing big yet. A friggin' gold mine! That's incredible. Where exactly is Suriname? Between the US and South America. Once I'm settled down, I'll send you airline tickets. Get outta here. We finally get to travel abroad thanks to Mundo? That's the least I can do for you two. You need to get away from work from time to time. And you will let me tag along when you go, right? Hey, over here. What smells so good? Come and sit down, Sujae. Man, I thought you were dead. It's a long story. What happened to you? You look terrible. It would have been a long story, too, if it wasn't for Jongbae. I swear, until the day I die, I'll never forget... Just pour me a drink. What? Let's drink. Salud! Cheers. Help yourselves. 6 months later Ow! Keep still. I'm trying to make you pretty. But my skull hurts if you pull too hard. Skull? Where did you learn such a word? From daddy. Did you say your skull hurts in front of Hyerin? What are you talking about? You're acting funny. Don't be silly. Didn't Sujae call? No. Why? He's not returning my calls. See you later, honey. Bye bye Mommy. I'll come in right after I clean up. Is everything alright? You look as if you haven't eaten in days. I was in the neighborhood and had a sudden craving for your food. Sorry... I just stopped by for a bite. 22:40, a male body found hanging from a tree with a suicide note and a bag Request identification The private loan that the deceased owed amounted to $600,000. $200,000 of which you stood as a guarantor. 200 grand? That's bullshit. I stood surety for just 50,000. He said he needed it for 3 months. How was I supposed to say no? You stood surety for 200 grand? No, for 50,000 How can interest pile up so quickly? I hate you, mommy. Don't throw her stuff out. Where are we gonna put them? It's no use crying over it. There's nothing you can do. Hey. What's up? Hey, Mundo - Did you have trouble finding your way here? - No, the bus stopped right in front. This is the man I look up to like a big brother and his wife. And this is mi amor, my girlfriend. Hi, I'm Lee Suji. 4,000 bucks? So, all I gotta do is to bring in the rough stones you excavate. That's right. 4 grand for just 3 days going back and forth to Paris? What do you say? I'm in. All you gotta do is to bring back a bag. Mundo has great connections with the customs people. Something doesn't smell right. If you get caught, you just pay customs. If not, it's 'gracias'. Why do customs a favor? You just have to pay customs if you get caught? That's right. Honey. Can't you see that Mundo is trying to help us out? Don't. Don't you even think about it. I said I'd give it a thought not that I'd do it. What's the difference? Listening to your friends never did you any good. Just drop it, will you? Perfect. Are you home? Yes. You're really trying my patience. I'll pay you real soon. When? You've been living off your rent deposit for months. Just a few days more, I'm so sorry. It won't happen again. I've been sticking it out because I felt sorry for you. This house will find a new tenant in no time. Are you a little kid? Did you commit a crime? 'This'll never happen again?' It's not like we ran off with her money. We said we'd pay her. With what money? What money? Hey, Mundo! It's me. Honey. Let's do this. When do we start? What? You should've told me that it was a job for a woman. My wife? Forget it. She doesn't even have a passport. What's the matter with you? I said I'd take care of it, alright? If only you discussed things with me... Would you have said yes? God damn it. I'm such a fucking loser that I dragged you into this shit hole. I'm such a stupid fuck that lost everything you saved up and got you humiliated by the fucking landlady. I can't believe you're still trying to prove you're right. Sujae's dead. You think he wanted to do this to me? Where are you going? It's okay, honey. Mommy and daddy aren't fighting. Here. Mommy, how come daddy hasn't come home? He didn't come home yesterday and yesterday. I didn't get to see Seungah. You miss your friend and want to go back to kindergarten? Yeah. Okay. But only if you eat your breakfast. Mundo? It's me, Jongbae's wife. Mommy. This one's nice. Come here It's a pink bunny, your favorite. Hi. Here's 2 dollars. Hyerin. Mommy, when are you coming home? Just three nights and mommy will come home with a lot of money. I'll buy you the doll you wanted. Really? Yes! So, be a good girl and don't fight with Seungah. Promise? Princess, your hands are as cold as ice. Mommy, I'm cold. Why didn't you say so? I'll give a piggy back ride. Shall we sing the Tomato song? Wonderfully plump body. Dressed in red. Letting off a sweet and sour scent. Here comes the magnificent Mr. Tomato. I will turn myself into juice! Gulp! I will turn myself into ketchup! Squirt! I will dance all day long! Hey! Hyerin, dad's home. Going away for a few days. Don't look for me. I left Hyerin at Seungah's place. Going away? 30-Oct-04 Ma'am. Yes. From Guyana? We have a suspicious Asian female traveling from Guyana. Wait here. Ma'am? Thank you. Go ahead. I'll meet you outside. Excuse me, ma'am. May I see your passport? Your passport, please. Your passport, ma'am. Sangcheol. Give me the keys. I don't... know. Give me the key to open the luggage. It's not mine. No... No! What's this? Cocaine? Cocaine? No... No cocaine. You see? Cocaine. No. There are people waiting for me outside. Also in Guyana. People... Guyana... No, please! People... Outside the airport... Suji! What happened to Mundo? He ran off on his own. Did you give us up? I had no choice. They said it was all cocaine. So, she was carrying 120 million dollar worth of cocaine on your behalf? You've got it all wrong. It was supposed to be rough stones. Seo Mundo said it was just stones. So we just gotta catch this Seo Mundo and he'll testify that your wife was just an accessory. But I can't get hold of him. Where the hell is my wife now? You should inquire at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. We need a urine sample. Sorry? A housewife from Korea was caught trafficking drugs for the international 'Cali Cartel' drug ring. And you're the husband. Daddy's going to the toilet real quick. Hey! Do it here. Excuse me? Do it here where we can see. It's no use if you put water in it. But how can I...? Use that corner over there. A sample of your hair, too. Daddy, what are you doing? Get back to your seat. - What are you doing? - Go away. But why? I said go away. Mommy. Mommy. Ms. Lee must leave France immediately. What about me? As a suspect in flagrante delicto, you'll face trial. Sorry for leaving without you. Suji. Please... I had no idea it was drugs. I'm just a housewife and I have a little girl. Can I make a call to Korea? My husband doesn't know that I'm here. Narcotics offenders are prohibited from making calls. Then, can you call my husband for me? I gotta at least let him know that I'm here. As a fellow Korean, I am begging you. I work for the French Public Prosecutors' Office. Write a letter when you get to prison. What a disgrace! Hyerin. What's mommy gonna do? Honey, what am I gonna do? What a national disgrace! How can she not have known? Alright... Ciao. What do they say? The Embassy is looking into it as we speak. Give them a call after a few days. These ignorant fools who know nothing about diplomacy. Korean Embassy in Paris. Babble away as they please and expect us to pick up their shit. Absolutely right. About the woman arrested at Orly for smuggling drugs... Drugs? At Orly? When did that happen? I thought you might like to pay her a visit. Can't you deal with that sort of stuff? Yes, sir. Fresnes Prison, Paris - Ms Song Jeongyeon? - Yes. My name is Chu Daeyun. I'm from the Korean Embassy. Thank you so much for coming. This is a document confirming you've been lawfully arrested and there was no wrongful treatment. Sign here, please. What's going to happen to me now? How long will I be held here? You see, I don't know any French... Shameful as I am to say this but I am innocent. If I knew it was drugs, I never would've done it. Yes, I'm sure. This is from the Embassy. Alright then. I'm so sorry but can you let me make a call? I've been here more than twenty days now. Drug offenders aren't allowed calls. It's the rule here. Please, I beg you I'll be quick. Just one minute. Please! The number you have called is currently engaged... I'll pay the rest in installments. Hyerin? I know but I'm all that she's got. I guess he's not available. I'm sorry. The number you have dialed is switched off Please try again later Hey, Mundo. Call me. I can't believe this is happening. Please call back. - Hello? - What took you so long to answer? Is that... you? Where are you? What the hell happened? You're asking me? How can you have gone there without telling me? Where's Hyerin? Is she asking for me? Is she with you? Hold on. She's in the car. How can you leave a 4-year-old alone in the car? What's wrong with you? Honey, please hurry. I'm almost there. Suji is deported to Korea. What? She's released? Yeah... and I have to wait 4 months to get trial. Why the hell did you go there without telling me? Why did you guarantee a loan without telling me? Honey? Ma'am, your 3 minute's up. I'm here, I'm here. - Please! Just 10 seconds more - I'm almost there Hyerin! It's mommy. - Hyerin? Please just a second. - Your time's up. It's mommy, baby. Mommy? Honey? Wait! Honey? Please help me! Hello? Are you there? Song Jeongyeon! You have Lee Suji? Look at me. You know me, don't you? How come you're here when my wife's still held in France? We're in the middle of interrogation. Please step outside. Where is Mundo? That fucking bastard. Hey, I said we're in the middle of interrogation. Get out of here. You gotta catch that bastard to clear my wife of her charges. He tricked her into committing a felony. Can't you see that, damn it? Kim Jongbae! Who do you think you are to run amok here? You're married to a felon. Fly your ass over to Suriname and nab the bastard yourself. If you have a goddamn problem with the judicial system. I'm terribly sorry. I'm just so frustrated... I'll wait for you to finish. Then, have a chat with her. Seo Mundo is wanted for pulling a pyramid scam. The detectives told me. I thought you've been friends for years. Shouldn't you have known better? I know. Do you know a guy called Ha Taegwang? Ha Taegwang? They're like best buddies. Think they were in pyramid scam, too. Yes, I met Ms. Song in person. She seemed to be doing okay. This is an advanced country. Prison facility is as good as hotel. But it takes 4 months to be tried in court? You know how slow the French are. Or don't you? What should I be doing here? Get a lawyer. That'll definitely speed things up... ...and affect the decision positively. We'll continue our communication with the prison Focus on getting the money for the lawyer. How much should I be looking at? Perhaps around 10,000 - 20,000? It could be more if the trial drags on if you can't afford one, France has an excellent public defense system. I'll call you back. Was that her husband? He must be pretty agitated with the wife locked up in prison. Why did he make her do such a thing? What a loser! If we present a petition and the ambassador gets involved, we may be able to get her indictment without detention. Shouldn't we report this to the ambassador? To the ambassador? If she gets indictment without detention, she becomes our responsibility. We mustn't waste taxpayers' money like that. She did carry drugs for a fact. I guess she's in for a rough ride. Hey! Excuse me. Hey! Come out here for a second. Is this a fucking joke? - The number you have dialed... - Damn you Sweetie. 3 months later Hi honey, hope you're well. I'm doing okay It must be pretty cold in Seoul by now. Didn't Hyerin catch a cold? Please write me, honey. And don't worry about me. Get up. You're being transferred. I... go home? Korea? You're not going back to Korea. You're going to another prison. I... go home? Korea? Korea... No? Where? Where? Stop asking. You don't understand anything I say anyway. 31-Jan-05 Where...? Where... I? Martinique. Don't worry. This is also French territory. Ducos Prison Bonjour. My name is Hellboy. I'm the chief guard. Take off your clothes. Move it, yellow face. Hurry up. Come on. Top, bottom, everything comes off. This, too. Cough. Cough. What are you doing? I'm pregnant. You're pregnant? I'm telling you the truth. Pregnant, eh? The cocaine must have burst inside. Call an ambulance. Don't you know how to say hello? Come here, Momo. Swallow it. Now. Open her mouth. Swallow it and go to sleep. Hyerin... Why are you doing this? Where is Seo Mundo? Answer me. Should I believe you or not? Fucking morons! Why go beat up a civilian... ...instead of nabbing Mundo? Sorry. I'm not the kind to bash people up for no reason. I hear your wife's in prison. Why don't you treat yourself to a bowl of hot soup? Why is your gang looking for Mundo? Your gang? Everything else I can tolerate. That motherfucker fucked around with my account book. My business is cash so, I'm sharp on numbers. Then, maybe we should work together. Work together? Yeah. You're hilarious. Go wipe your own ass. Where did you find this joker? For crying out loud! She's only a kid. I can't let them not smoke here or they'll do something worse. I stopped by your house and picked up your mail. You must've written the address wrong. Just tell her the truth and give her my address here. She'll find out sooner or later. And wash your kid. She's been scratching all day. I'm not going with you. I wanna go with mommy. You've been here with mommy and daddy before, remember? Hyerin. Hyerin. Sweetheart. Mommy. Send her through the women's. I'll take her in. Hyerin, will you go with this nice lady, then?

What's your name? - Choi Byeonggu. - Okay, Byeonggu. The number you have dialed is not in service You've got the wrong number. Stop calling, psycho! Vincent's Watches Hello? Is this Vincent's Watches? You're looking for Vincent? Are you a member? I'm a friend of Seo Mundo's. Mr. Seo, I see. I'll call you right back Hello? I'm back. Good job. Are you looking for Vincent? Yes. You're a friend of Mundo's? Made in Suriname? 5, 7, 9... Difference is the weight in grams. Pardon me? Lighter watches are more expensive. Which one do you want? Do you know a man called Ha Taegwang? You're looking for Mr. Ha? He's out of office. Why don't you wait here? I'm telling you, he said 'Seo Mundo, made in Suriname'. And I saw the same brand of cigars that Mundo gave me. Bring in Ha Taegwang and you'll get a lead. Just hear me out. They watch too many movies. What's the matter? He wants to tip me off about... ...some Ha Taegwang character playing detective. Did you say Ha Taegwang? He's on the wanted list. What? That's right. For fraud. Get away from me, damn niggers! You called me a nigger, bitch? I said fuck you! You, Hellboy-cunt-licking whore. What's going on? Move along. Yalka... Thank you. You out of your fucking mind, bitch? What have we got here? Give it back. I'll kill you. Help... Please... - Yalka. - Don't touch me. Yalka... This. Mama! It's my mom. Sorry, mama. I'm sorry... The picture got wet. I'm a mommy, too. My baby... She's far away. I miss my daughter, too. So, don't cry. If you cry, you mama will be sad. Thank you, Song. Something does smell fishy. It does, right? And the place was shut down? I checked it myself. - Put out the word on him. - Yes, boss. Let's go. You're coming with us? Of course, I am. Hello? I haven't heard from you in a while. You said these were important. Hi, darling. How is everything? How is my little girl? I've been transferred to an island called Martinique. They said I would get my trial in 4 months. I don't understand how I ended up here. It was so cold in Paris but this is a tropical island. It's so hot and humid that I can't sleep or eat. All I can do is think about you and Hyerin. Aren't you on night shift tonight? Hey, can you find this Martin... place? Martinique... Ducos? This is from your wife? So, find it. The Embassy people came once and haven't replied to my letters. In Paris, they gave me work to do, but there is nothing to do here. And the days go terribly slowly. You need money for everything here even for some salt. I have to buy stamps to send letters I feel terrible asking you this, but I really need some money I know you're struggling as you are. Can you send me a picture of Hyerin? Some summer clothes and underwear, too? Don't forget the French dictionary. And please show Hyerin my pictures... ...so she won't forget my face. Show her the video from our wedding. Please do, honey. It's on the opposite side of the planet from us. It's an island in the middle of the Caribbean. It's far. Super express, please. Martinique... Ducos Prison? Yes. International postal money order take more than 20 days. If you go through the Embassy, they can process it directly. Thank you for calling the Korean Embassy. The office is now closed. Operating hours are from 9 am to 5 pm... Who called in that joker? He was begging so badly and I felt sorry. I'm more sorry for your sorry ass. Chief? Is that... Kim Jongbae? Where is Mundo? Calm down, man. Who the hell are you, motherfuckers? Motherfuckers? Did you call me a motherfucker? How dare you, you fucking bastard! Don't move. Get out of there. Who the hell are you? Get him out of here. Where is Mundo? How did you know this was Seo Mundo's hideout? You told me to bring in Seo. It was me that gave you information about Ha Taegwang. We've been keeping a tap on it all along. Who the hell are you? I'm a friend of his from hometown. I tagged along to give him support. Civilians shouldn't interfere with police business like this. Since this is classified information, bear with us for a while longer. Classified Information, my ass. That's fucking classic. Go fuck yourself. I guess this is it for us. I wish you wealth and happiness. It always rains when the Indians perform a rain dance. You know why? Because they don't fucking stop until the rain falls. Like fucking bullheads. Martinique How did she end up there? I have no idea. She doesn't understand either. I'll look into it and get back to you. Wait! Shouldn't you know about it before anyone? How are we supposed to know details like that? Fine... Can I at least ask you to process a money wire to the prison? They tell me it's faster if I go through the Embassy. You think our job is to provide convenience for criminals? What would taxpayers say if they found out? She can't do anything without money. Please show leniency. You think a public servant is there to run personal errands? Still on the phone? Where's assemblymen's schedule? How many Michelin stars is this place rated by? Oh, that one? It's a popular place. What if they ask? They might think it's a restaurant with no Michelin stars. I'll check right away, sir. This could be a big break for you and I, you know? Given that the principal offender Seo Mundo has yet to be arrested for this court to be able to proceed with the trial of the defendant I hereby extend the provisional detention of Song Jeongyeon by another 4 months. Does the Korean Embassy have any intention to provide an interpreter? Apologies, your honor. I placed a request but they haven't responded. Excuse me. Hello? Yes? Why... I, here? I... Paris... now, Martinique... Why? It's because the jurisdiction is in Martinique. Before we are able to have a proper trial, we'll receive a review of legality of confinement every 4 months. Drug-related offenses can get up to 24 months without trial. Kim, we got Seo Mundo. How can you do this to me and call yourself a human being? Get off me for Christ's sake! What's your problem? She asked me to give her the job. What? She's in deep shit because of you. Do right by her. Come here, you fucking bastard. - Kim Jongbae! - You, son of a bitch! Calm down. This is obstruction of justice. Don't mess with him until the trial ends. You need a favorable testimony from him to get your wife off the hook. I'm so sorry, Mundo. Please help me save Jeongyeon. My daughter hasn't seen her mom in 6 months. Just tell them that she had no knowledge of the drugs. I beg you, please. Please, Mundo. Dear Mr. Consul. I finally met the judge after getting transferred to Martinique, but I couldn't understand anything because there was no interpreter. I know this is a far and remote place... ...but is there any way you can find an interpreter? Yellow face. I thought your Embassy didn't have anyone who spoke your language. You wrote them again? This is against the rules. I'm confiscating them. I have no panties. Give me please. Confiscated. Hello, baby? My darling, Jeongyeon. Hyerin and I are doing great. She is well, too. Things are going well. You have nothing to worry about but yourself. You go through so much for meeting a foolish husband. I blame myself for everything that happened. It's all my fault. Let's not give up and believe that it'll work out. You trust me, don't you? I couldn't find your underwear so, I bought some new ones. I suppose Hyerin has grown a lot. I can't ever pay her back for what I've done to her and you. Please send me some recent pictures of Hyerin. Get moving, will ya? If I... don't make it back for her birthday. Please take care of it for me. Take her to an amusement park if you can afford it. Daddy. My baby. Hyerin, it's me, mommy. Are you being a good girl? Mommy is studying hard so that she can come home sooner. Can you promise to be a good girl? Be happy and strong for me. I'm so sorry, I had to come so far. I'm really sorry. One, two... Come on, give me a smile. I'm the drug-trafficker's husband. Martinique! I looked into it. Your wife loaded the drugs at Guyana. That's why the jurisdiction is in Martinique. I already know that. Can you provide an interpreter? An interpreter? There isn't a single Korean living there. Should we send one from Paris? It's 9 hours away. And who's gonna cover the expenses? Is there any way that the Embassy can cover it? It's your responsibility. We don't have the budget for that. What is it that the Embassy does, then? It's not my job to explain that to you. I've really got to go. What did he say? He says there isn't a single Korean living there. How the hell did she end up in a place like that? Shall I look up on the internet? The Embassy already said there's no Korean living there. Do you know about a Korean housewife locked away in prison... ...in a remote island in the middle of the Atlantic? The lives of her family are ruined. July29, 2005. Seoul District Court. Park Sangcheol, Lee Suji and Song Jeongyeon have all denied connection to the drugs at the time of their arrest. Were they aware of the drugs when departing from Guyana? Sangcheol knew about it, your honor. What about Song Jeongyeon and Lee Suji? They had no idea. Mr. Prosecutor. I'm Song Jeongyeon's husband. What is going to happen to my wife now? Ask the Korean Embassy in France. But they don't make a habit of explaining things. Mr. Prosecutor. The trial records will be sent over to the Korean Embassy in France. Once they translate and notarize it and submit it to the French court... ...your wife will be able to get an official trial. I see... Thank you. Since Seo testified that it was a simple participation... ...her sentence won't be that long Thank you so much. Yalka! Yalka! 9 months in detention I'm finally getting my trial. Trial. Trial? Yes, trial. Hello, Mr. Chu? This is Kim Jongbae. My wife is finally able to get her trial. Seo's trial records will be sent over to you shortly. Please have them well translated and notarized... ...and submit them safely to the court. I'll be calling you again. Thank you so much for telling me how to do my job. 2 months later French translation of Seo Mundo trial records What do you think you're doing? Just sorting the outgoing mail, sir. The assembly men will arrive in any moment. And look at this mess we have here. We'll clean it up right away. Put these away, too. Come on. Smile for the camera, please. One more. Lunch will be served at a three Michelin starred restaurant. Only three? It should be at least seven. Three is the highest rating. I was only joking. You have such a great sense of humor. What's this? That's the pile from earlier. These shouldn't be lying around here. Documents to be shredded from this quarter, please. Given that the principal offender Seo Mundo has yet to be arrested... ...and neither the government of Republic of Korea nor the Embassy... ...submitted any relevant documents for this court to be able to... ...proceed with the trial of the defendant, I hereby extend the provisional detention of the defendant, Song Jeongyeon... by another 4 months. Trial... My trial... My trial is possible. Because... Seo Mundo is arrested. My trial... Please sit down, ma'am. We are doing our best. Your Embassy is bad. Your Embassy has no responsibility. Ask for a translator to your Embassy, okay? Guard. 11 months in detention Dear Honorable Consul, my husband tells me that Seo Mundo has been arrested, and yet, I still can't get my trial, I plead you to provide Seo's trial records and an interpreter in the next 4 months. I beg you desperately. As ashamed I am, I, too, am a citizen of the Republic of Korea. It's the drug housewife again. Will we have to move? Hey sis, what's up? You're coming tomorrow, aren't you? Don't be alarmed but Hyerin had a little accident. How are you going to get back at this hour? I already bought the tickets for the last bus. Bye bye, auntie. We need to get the wound disinfected. I'll take care of it. You talk as if I did a sloppy job taking care of your daughter. She wanted help to make her birthday soup for you. I know, I hear ya. I'm not mad at you. I'm grateful. Neither of us knew this would drag so long. I can't burden you any longer. We'll be on our way. Donggeun, uncle's leaving. And she doesn't look back once. Look, a deer. Where? There it is. Come here, pretty deer. It's coming. Daddy, you have this. Auntie gave it to me. I don't need a birthday present. I just want you. To temporary amusement park. Let's go, sweetie. I'm so happy that Hyerin had a good birthday. She says she doesn't need a present, and doesn't cry in front of you, because she promised? My trial has been postponed again. I wonder how much longer I'll have to wait. Why you look so depressed? You want this? Put them on. Put'em on now. Come on. Yalka won't listen to me any more because of you. You're gonna have to please me instead, then. Get off of me. Go away. Help me. Get off of me. Help. Hurry! Someone's coming. Just close the damn door. Shut the door. Be quiet. Is this the right direction to get to Mount Pelee? Yes, just go straight ahead. Is everything alright there? Sure, go right ahead. Help me. What's going on? Everything alright? All is in order. Help me! Help. Help me. Call the police. What are you doing with that phone? We were just... Show me your papers. She's getting away. Get back here. Stop. Stop, you bitch! Go after her.

Did you give chocolates to your loved ones? 16 months in detention I hope all our listeners are with their loved ones now and wish you a happy Valentine's Day. Honey, it's me. Hey, I'm here. How did you manage to call? I'm out of prison. What? Where are you? Are you out on parole? I think so. From now on, you will be awaiting your trial under my supervision... ...in a non-detainment capacity There are a few very important rules to bear in mind. You must be back at your apartment by no later than 7 pm... ...and may not stray away from your living quarters. You must always respond to the convocations... ...and come into this office once a week to sign in. Sorry. It's not great. This is for you. See you next week. Okay? She's out on parole. Congratulations. It's worse than being in prison. Now she has to pay the rent and food? You should ask the French court. How can I when I don't speak French? We advised you to get an interpreter. Complain to the French court directly instead of bothering us. French Embassy in Korea. My child's mother is being held in French prison without trial. Let my wife come home from prison in Martinique. Who is that man? One moment. Everyone is logged in on 'Supporters of Song Jeongyeon'? You may not understand the significance of your work now. Take pride in what you're doing and keep posting comments. By doing this, you're saving a family and eventually the world. Add more exclamation points. Use four! Where did you learn to do that? Great job. Look at this, Mr. Ambassador. It's on our website, too. This is the public reaction? Yes, sir. We're doing the best we can. But as you know, the French are slow with everything. Yes, it's our duty to protect the interests of Korean citizens overseas. Okay... Bye. The problem is the French who take forever to do anything. When did we send off those documents? Everything's a mess because they didn't proceed with the trial. What's with all this fuss on the net? Mr. Consul. How about taking a trip to Martinique? In case they hold you responsible for not following the procedure. Besides, it's the Caribbean. People go there for vacation. Vacation? I have nothing else to offer you. Please contain yourself in front of the Consul. Everything else is fine but because of the language problem... ...it's hard to understand what's going on.... ...and no one is explaining things to me... It must be hard being incarcerated far from home. But they say 'An evil may turn out a blessing in disguise'. People spend a lot of money to come here for vacation. Consider yourself lucky. Positive thinking, you know? When will I get my trial? It's no good feeling so anxious. You won't be leaving any time soon anyway. Excuse me? Didn't you know? Drug offenses are taken very seriously. Simple carrying can get you up to 10 years in prison. And that's getting it easy. 10 years? But I didn't know it was drugs. That's the law here Any way Ms. Song... It's Song Jeongyeon. It's important to find peace of mind, Ms. Song. Have you ever tried meditation? These walls are perfect. Sit facing the wall with your legs crossed. Try it. It'll do wonders. You can't just leave like this. I am sorry, I committed a terrible crime. I'll repent till the day I die for bringing disgrace to my country. So, please. Mr. Consul, please send me to a prison in Korea. I'm not asking to be released. You should try to find inner peace. That way your husband can focus on paying off his debt... ...and getting a place to live. What do you mean 'a place to live?' Your husband told me... that he got kicked out of the house. Why don't you get yourself something to drink? Please let me meet the judge. Please one question! What does she want? Trial... Trial... Ten years? Really ten years? This is the court house. You are only permitted to see me in presence of a parole officer. Am I really getting ten years? Is it true? Tell me, please. Please! Dear Mr. Consul, thank you for coming all the way to meet me, but I cannot accept the money you gave me, FA 0: Korean Embassy in France FA 0: Mn Kim Jongbae My beloved Mr. Kim Jongbae, It's your wife, Song Jeongyeon. I remember the day we first met. Our first night together, and the moment we held Hyerin in our arms for the first time. These were the most brilliant moments of my life. I can clearly remember the entire 8 years we spent together. Yalka. Yalka. Song? Song! Are you okay? Are you okay? Yes, I'm okay. Are you? I'm okay. I'm okay. I only realized after I got released on parole, that this was the Caribbean, the place we promised to come for our tenth wedding anniversary. And I realized, that I've been living in my nightmare, I don't want you to struggle in my nightmare any more. You deserve to be happy. As long as I endure this, it'll only make you suffer more. And that's the worst nightmare I can imagine. Jeongyeon. Open the door, Jeongyeon. If it wasn't for you, I couldn't have survived the year and a half in this deserted place, So, I thank you, and I regret, I could have loved you more. I truly could have. Please tell Hyerin that I love her, that I'm so sorry. It's my wife. Something's not right, and I can't reach the Embassy. Please look at this letter. Can you come back later? Please check if she's alive. Come back later. Later? When? A woman who carried drugs deserves to die? She's not a Korean citizen? Is it so damn hard to check if she's alive or dead? What are you doing? Put that down. Get off of me. Is it so hard to find out if she's alive or dead? Hang in there, Jeongyeon. Jeongyeon. Wait for me, Jeongyeon. Kim Jongbae. Come out! Jeez, look at you. Not now, let's go. This is a producer from KBC. He wants to do a story on Jeongyeon. My name is Shin Cheolho. You must've been through a lot. I have good news for you. Netizens have found a Korean living in Martinique. But the Embassy told me there were no Koreans living there. Did this person meet Jeongyeon? Is she okay? She's stable now but she's suffering from a severe malnutrition. We are planning to fly over to Martinique. Are you coming with us? Pardon? Pardon? I see... Okay. We'll go straight to her parole house. What do they say? She was discharged this morning. She is really fragile. I don't know how she managed until now. This is it. Honey. Jeongyeon, are you there? Jeongyeon. Honey. It's me. Open the door. Jeongyeon. Why are you crying? Don't cry. Open this door. Open the door. Look at you. What happened to you? Is that really you? You came all this way here? Look at you. Let me show you Hyerin. Hyerin, do you have something you want to tell mommy? I do. What is it? Mommy, I can't remember your face. My skull hurts because of that. Hurry back home, mommy. I love you. Anything else? I will... Mommy is coming home soon. I love you and miss you, too. Are you sure you never received the documents? Tell them to send the documents right away, if they have them. Ms. Song's case is pretty straightforward. Was she deceived or not? Without evidence to contrary, we have no choice but to assume criminal intent. If such documents exist, that assumption can be changed. But where are the documents? What challenges did you encounter while defending Ms Song? Listen! What can I do when I can't even communicate with my client? There was nothing I could do. Stop filming. How come the Embassy didn't know that you were here? I'm puzzled myself. I sent my documents to Paris last year to have my passport renewed. Here we are in the Carribean after all. How come they're still up? I guess they can't sleep either. Honey. Can I go home instead of you? I want to go. Okay, let's do that. Let's do that, Jeongyeon. Your wife isn't coming? She can't come to the airport. She's afraid she couldn't bear to come back here. I understand. Let's go. Our hearts go out to her regarding the situation. It must be so hard being away from her child, and face loneliness and hardship. It seemed that your hearts didn't go out that far. You told her there were no Koreans living there, but there was a Korean woman who's been studying there for 3 years. We did the best we could with the given manpower and budget. We absolutely regret the situation. What about the trial records? According to the judge and prosecutor... That's what I wanted to talk about. We put a lot of time and effort into translating and notarizing it, and sent it out by registered mail. This is the outgoing mail book. As you can see, the documents were posted on November 24. We also have a copy. France may seem like an advanced country but there's always strikes, and they're not as precise as we are. You said you sent them out by registered mail? It's mandatory for official documents. Then, you must have the receipt. Are you being serious? We're civil servants hired by the Korean government. Are you accusing us of lying? Mr. Chu, bring them the receipt. Excuse me for a moment. Is this all? Wait. This is from last year, too? Just a minute. How well did you hide it? - Move over. - I'm still looking, sir. Here it is. No, this isn't it. It's not some old receipt that's important. We have sent the documents. That's what matters, right? How many times did I ask you to check it? Do you know who you're talking to? Get that camera off my face. Stop filming. What's the matter with him? Somebody stop him. You talked to me on the phone. Why get all violent? - Calm down. - Stop him. You got my calls, didn't you? Didn't you? Do you have any idea what an awkward situation you put us in? Your husband barged in with a TV camera. We're not criminals. What ungrateful people you are! Calm down. You're acting as if we did something wrong. Explain it kindly. I don't understand. I'll be honest with you. You are making a huge mistake. You think these television people can help solve your problem? You are currently on parole. Pulling something like this is breaking French law. What are you telling me? You could be going to back to jail. You keep poking around at the French judicial system. How would that make them feel? And the trial records... they're not as important as you think. They can't expedite the process either. Stop being so stubborn about something that's of little importance. We're acting stubborn? Take what I just said to heart and tell your husband, that he'll ruin everything if he continues like that. Wait. Let's go. Wait! Please. What now? Let's go. This is from France. Here. ...recommend that you hold off the broadcast? What the fuck is wrong with these people? This won't affect us broadcasting the program, but since this concerns you also, I thought I should let you know. It's just blackmail. There is nothing they can do. Excuse me. Hello, Jihye. What? How can it not be important? How can they say we're being stubborn? Don't believe a word they say. It's just blackmail. I never said I wouldn't pay for what I've done. All I wanted was a little attention. I know... Stop crying. It'll make you weaker. This isn't over yet. Jongbae, it's on. Martinique, a remote Caribbean island 22 hours away by plane. There is a Korean woman locked away in prison here for over a year. I never imagined it could be drugs. I thought it was rough gemstones. Ms. Song's case is pretty straightforward. Was she deceived or not? Jeongyeon. Take a look at this. "How much she must miss her daughter?" "It's not just the Embassy but a problem of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs." "Be strong, Jeongyeon." This is creating a huge stir on the net. If America has nuclear bombs we have netizens. We're an Internet nation. "Scandalous! Waste of taxpayer money" "I'm sending you support as a mother Never give up hope." "Hang in there, Song's family We have your backs!" "How can the lost time be compensated?" I'm Song Jeongyeon's husband. My wife has been held in prison in Martinique without trial. But, no one cared to listen to my story. I blamed the man who put my wife in this situation, I blamed my country that did nothing for her, and I blamed my wife for getting herself in this mess. But, I'm the one that drove her to go so far away. It was me. I failed to keep my promise to always keep her happy, and keep the smile on my daughter's face. But' this new hope you have given me, I will never let it go. "Ministry of Foreign Affairs, we'll be watching how you deal with this" What if Song was from a powerful family? "Citizens are watching you" "Do not delete this post again!" "Please share this post so that more people can see" "We're sending Song a parcel" "Raising funds to help Song's family" Give Song your hope. I knew it would lead to this. "Ministry of Foreign Affairs, do you really work for this country?" It's all over the TV and the Internet. I heard they've been reassigned somewhere in Central Asia. Uzebekistan? Kazakhstan? 08-Nov-06 24 months in detention This is Bekhor. Your new lawyer. Bonjour, Olivier Bekhor. Bonjour, nice to meet you. He says not to worry. Everything will be fine. Feel free to doze off, it usually gets boring in the court. And someone's come from the Embassy. Shall we? Please sit here. The 37 kilos of cocaine, the defendant tried to smuggle into the country... ...is an enormous quantity worth over 85 million Euro. This fact alone makes it impossible to avoid severe punishment. Your Honor, I believe you have examined Seo Mundo's trial records. He testified in court that in order to to get the defendant involved... ...in his cocaine smuggling scheme... ...he tricked her into believing that she was carrying gemstones. Until now, the defendant, Song Jeongyeon, has never been involved in any crime, including drug-related offenses or faced criminal indictment. Despite this, she was forced to spend 2 years in prison, in a country she is completely unfamiliar with. Does the defendant... ...have any last words to say? In that case, sentencing will be delivered after 10 minutes... I... I committed a crime. I committed a crime because of my foolish desire to earn money. I'm a criminal. And for the past 2 years, I've been repenting for my sin But there are others I must beg for forgiveness, My family, My husband who lost his wife, My daughter who grew up without her mother. She's six years old now. She was barely four when I left. She has turned five and then six. I have caused her so much pain that cannot be undone. I want to go back home pay for the wrong I've done. Please let my family have... ...the wife and mother back. I want to go back home. I... ...want to go back home. I want to go back home. The court sentences the defendant, Song Jeongyeon for the charges of violation of Drug Control Law, the Customs Act and the Aviation Act one year of imprisonment. He said one year. You've already served two years in prison. That means you can go home now. Wait, you have already served 2 years. What about the year already spent? If you file a lawsuit, you'll be able to claim compensation. You can claim compensation for the extra year you served. No... I just want to go home. Welcome home - Song Jeongyeon supporters The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade of the Republic of Korea requests ...efficient entry and necessary convenience to the holder of this passport. We'll be landing at Incheon International Airport shortly. We hope you had a pleasant flight and wish you a very good journey. Jeongyeon. There she is. Look, there is mommy. Can you see her? Mommy's here. Hyerin, are you being shy? It's mommy. Go to your mommy. Mommy hasn't forgotten your face. Have you forgotten mine? Come to mommy. Is it really you, mommy? From when I was little? It's me, baby. It's mommy. It is your mommy. It's mommy, baby. I missed you, mommy. I'm so sorry it took so long. Ow. Does it hurt? No. I think it does. No it doesn't. You're trying to make me pretty. Let me braid your hair. Honey! Hyerin! Daddy's home. - Daddy! - Wait. Come on out here. What? My queen and princess, it's the first snow of the year. Let's take a picture together. Lean in a little more. That's perfect. Hello? Hello, is this Mr. Kim Jongbae? This is the Ministry of Foreign Affairs We have good news for you. Your wife, Song Jeongyeon, had a trial and was sentenced to a year in prison. I believe she'll be able to come home soon. Mr. Kim? I'm coming. Come on, dad. Smile for the camera. Smile. - Let's have a look. - Let's see. Hyerin looks pretty. Whose daughter is that? Jang Mijeong returned home after spending 765 days in detention. She has since had another daughter and is living with her family. A 2013 film by Pang Eun Jin
