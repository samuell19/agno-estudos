Get out of here! Leave me alone! Go away! Leave me alone! Get out of my head! You don't belong here! - Who is it? - God. I told him to leave me alone. If he's everywhere... ...I'm not free even a second. - Free? - Free to be alone. To think alone. He always knows. May I? Yes. - Mr Ernesto Picciafuoco? - Yes, it's me. I'm Cardinal Piumini's secretary. He chairs the sacred committee... ...for the canonization process. - My hands are dirty. - Don't worry about that. His Eminence would like to see you. It's a mistake. Someone else with my name. It's you I'm looking for. It's to do with your mother's canonization... ...now in its second hearing. Why are you surprised? I'm surprised. You don't think it's surprising? My surprise is... ...absolute. And justified, I think. My mother, a saint. I admit I never considered it. The process was launched three years ago... ...by your brother, Monsignor Eugenio Picciafuoco. - Isn't he in Togo? - He directs and coordinates from there. And here in Rome, there's a very active group. - I had no idea. - The process has already reached the Vatican... ...hence the committee... - Three years. The hearing is now dealing... ...with your mother's supposed martyrdom... ...and her heroic virtues. Make my mother a saint? This is a fact... - It isn't a joke? - No, it isn't. I assure you it's not. Do you feel all right? You've just told me something incredible... ...totally unrelated to my life. His Eminence will see you tomorrow at the Vatican. A car will be sent for you. - Why? - His Eminence will probably have some questions. In this process... ...we listen to everyone's point of view. Tell me, do you know Filippo Argenti? He's a character in Dante's "Inferno". Maybe, but this one is real. He works for the Aquino Cooperative. I knew him. "Argenti" is a pseudonym. - So? - He's disappeared. He was due on the 2:52. - He's not at his hotel... - What does Filippo Argenti... ...have to do with my mother's canonization? I can't say any more. I'll see you tomorrow. - Hi. - Hi. You're pale. ...the politicians' jubilee. The Pope to politicians: "Be moral and competent". State of emergency in Valtellina. An avalanche. One man drowned in Friuli. A car-free Sunday in 150 cities. Amato stated: "Other measures are needed too". On the Fight Against Cancer Day Ciampi asked for patients'... ...waiting time to be cut. Veronesi: "It's possible". - Daddy! Daddy! ...many are still undecided. To win their vote, Gore and Bush are using the Internet. My dear aunts. Aunt Mariuccia! Why are you here? We're here at your wife's invitation. - And the painting? - We brought it with us. Your wife asked us to bring it. - First period. - Clearly. - Of course. - Will you eat with us? - Thank you, we already have. - We'll talk after dinner. - See you. - Evening, Ania. - Good evening. - Why are they here? - They're keeping me company. - Guido and Lucia arrive tomorrow. - With Erminio? - Aren't you meeting at the clinic? - Ah, yes. That's right. He says it's very important. He'll call. - Why are they bringing their kids? - I don't know. - They're at aunt Maria's. - Ah! No one knows why? They should know. - What's that? - Our teacher does it before eating. Ah! - What's wrong? - What? - You're angry? - Why? Not the left hand. You do it with the right. In the name of the Father... Right hand. In the name of the Father... Right hand! In the name of the Father, the Son... ...and... Wait. In the name of the Father... - Ghost? - Well done! The Holy Ghost. Amen. Eat. That's Mamma. And that's me. I don't see much resemblance. Your mother's smile was so gentle. Do you prefer this painting... ...or the work I'm doing now? That one, that one, that one. Actually, I don't know much about modern art... ...and I really don't know what to think. - Could you put him to bed? - What's wrong? That's true, but... - What's wrong? - I don't know. We have to be patient. You have to be patient. If you don't go to sleep... You already kissed me. There's something I can't figure out. - What? - There's six billion of us? More even. How can God control... ...six billion people at once? - You don't know. Good night. - Yes, I do. I don't believe in God. So when you die you end up alone... ...in the cemetery and we never see each other again. Who tells you this rubbish? The religion teacher. She says that... ...heaven is our life insurance. You tell your teacher that we're through with dying... ...that we're not going to get any older. Everybody's going to choose his age and stay there forever. And that's scientific. - We're not going to die anymore? - No. What age have you chosen? My own. I'm even a little bit behind. - And me? - You've got time. - Until when? You've got to grow up. Become a man. What's the best age to become immortal? The age of your first love. Remember it... ...and you'll be immortal. - And those who are dead? Those who are already dead... Get to sleep now, Leonardo. - Goodnight, dad. - Goodnight, Leonardo. I surprised Leonardo this afternoon. As his father, you ought to know. He was talking alone. I'd never seen him like it before. I asked him who he was talking to. "To God. Our teacher says he's everywhere..." "...so that means I'm not free." - So? - What do you mean? He told me too. Does he need to learn religion? He wanted to. It's gone all right until now. - Remember all the trouble it caused. - Yes, the arguments. - He was the only one... - So he should... ...believe in the beyond... ...because he can't accept death? - Are lies better? - Sh! You knew about my mother? Everyone knew but me. Does Leonardo know? - Answer me. - No. - Known long? - Since September, I think. After I left. So? What's the connection? We enrolled Leonardo in religious class then. You're paranoid. - I've got to go. - Where? I'm sorry. - I'll drive him to school. - He's ready at eight. Be on time. (Bloody... ) (Bloody... ) (Egidio, don't blaspheme.) (- It hurts me, and besides... - Bloody hell!) (... blaspheming doesn't help.) (- Bloody Hell! - Think of what... ) (... the Capuchin said. - Bloody Hell!) ("A lay brother who blasphemes." Think about it, Egidio.) Eminence, we owe a great deal... ...to the African missions and those in South America. And so I bow down to your authority. Thank you. Ernesto! Ernesto! - What are you doing? Running off? - I don't have much time. You don't do shit all day. Come with me. Eminence, this is Ernesto Picciafuoco... ...a great artist who remains unknown. Where are you going? Excuse-me, Eminence. - What's wrong? - I saw your comments on my drawings. About some details... - Are you going to sing or not? - Yes, I am. I was saying, about details... Are you listening? I got your comments, and I more or less agree. The problem is artistic freedom... ...in the face of a child's imagination. - It's out of date. - What's out of date? The Pied Piper. Keep your drawings. It was your idea. And you haven't paid me. We'll work it out, as usual. That's the hidden treasure. Eternity is a sound investment, as the word implies. A safe bet whose value increases with time... ...and resists change. - Like banks. - What's the connection? Questions and answers are a waste of time. Let's go beyond that. Beyond words! I was thinking of you for something extraordinary. Maria. Ma-ri-a. The life of Saint Maria Goretti. An animated film, drawn by you. - Fame, success... - Why me? You want to make money, so make movies. Haven't you always dreamt of that? You haven't answered my question. Why me? Go to hell. No one cries at patriotic anthems anymore. What we need is a king. I don't trust Mazzinians... ...mere lay priests more dangerous than real ones. A monarchy, that would be the focus... ...of this feeling, the sense of being Italian. We need a monarchy, an absolute one. Absolute in its self-defence against the Pope... ...who, in actual fact, reigns as an absolute monarch... ...over the minds of all Italians. The real king. Everyone kneels down to a man... ...who rules without majority consent. So I imagine a despotic king of Italy, a real tyrant. A Carlo Alberto with more character... ...who'd return land and convents to the Church... ...but remove crosses from schools and courtrooms. Count, I too like paradoxes. - That isn't one. - Okay. But the past can't repeat itself. We must travel back... ...far back, not fearing the dark. - Back to where? - Where the rock begins... ...and the mud ends. To the first babbling... It's funny? - You don't agree? - Sorry? You smiled. Are you talking to me? Don't act stupid. You smiled. I haven't come here to play your fool. What you said, like it or not, is comical. Because it's absurd. - He's still smiling! - Incredible! - Who are you? - Ernesto Picciafuoco. That's not enough. You know who Count Bulla is? No, who? Being funny is a divine gift. - Actually, I agree in a way... - No. You're with "that" party, here as an agitator. - What party? - You know. - I don't know at all. - The party... ...of mothers' saint-makers. Not soap-makers, right? What are you talking about? Serious matters. Hawking noble feelings... ...is ignoble. Are you a buffoon by profession orjust raving? Buffoon? If you're not a coward, we'll meet... ...on the field of honour... ...the sole virtue worth dying for. The honour of Rigoletto and Radames. My seconds will announce the site and weapons. - You were wrong to provoke the Count. - Who? Count Bulla. You were wrong to play the wise guy. They're all mad here. Marta Giostrai, wife of Picciafuoco. Mother of five... ...killed by her son Egidio. Killed by her son. Egidio Picciafuoco, guilty of murder. Judged mentally ill. Ettore, accused of associating with armed groups... ...converted to Catholicism. Filippo Argenti. A miracle. Inexplicably cured. ...Refugium peccatorum... ...Consolatrix afflictorum... ...Auxilium Christianorum... ...Regina Pacis... ...Regina Virginum... ...Regina Apostolorum... ...Regina Martirum... Don't look so grim! Keep still! Keep still a minute! - See you, killer. - See you, dad. - See you. Excuse me. I'd like to see... ...a religion teacher. - My son's. - Good morning! - Does she see parents today? - I think so. - Try the reception hall... ...the third on the right. Otherwise, ask in the office. - Thank you. - Come on, boys! Hurry up! Yes, that one. - Looking for me? - Yes. You are... - You're Ernesto Picciafuoco. - Yes. Leonardo's father? I'm Diana Sereni. How do you do? How do you do. His mother... She's worried he's a little obsessed. Last year, he didn't take religion. But this year, we thought... He's a normal, intelligent child. He works hard... ...he gets angry, reacts. He's normal. You're smiling. I imagined you differently, conventional. - How so? - Ugly. Pure prejudice. Like we think of nuns as ugly. You're very beautiful. "And yet that's not enough." It's a Russian poem that seems written for me. - Shall I recite it? - Yes. It's short. "Summer's fled and nothing's left." "We're happy in the sun and yet that's not enough." "A five-pointed leaf..." "...rests on my hand. And yet that's not enough." - It goes on. - It goes on? How? - Shall I go on? - Yes. "Good and evil haven't passed in vain." "All was limpid and bright and yet that's not enough." "Life takes me under its wing and carries me off." "I have been lucky and yet that's not enough." "Leaves and twigs aren't dead." "The day is as clear as crystal." "And yet that's not enough." That's it. Very beautiful. I'm touched. - Thank you. - You're welcome. I'm familiar with your work. It's beautiful. Full of colour and movement. You're a great painter. You exploit the background of a subject. Like the Renaissance masters... ...in the limited space... ...behind Jesus and the Saints. You work like they did. In unused space, you unleash your talent. A talent I lack. - You paint? - I dabble in painting, writing and music. All averagely. - Mr Picciafuoco? - Yes? His Eminence is waiting. - Who told you... - Your wife. Wait for me outside. - I have to go. - Will you look at my work? Okay. Here's my number. Phone and fax. - You won't laugh? - No, I won't. Mr Picciafuoco. Good morning. Come with me. - Am I late? - You're forgiven. Come on! Come on! Come on! Eminence, this is Ernesto Picciafuoco. Thank you for replying so kindly to our invitation. I'm delighted to meet you. Come. - Good morning. - Good morning. My dear brothers, we have a very special guest. - No... - The great painter Ernesto Picciafuoco. Where shall we sit? - Where you like. - Among our brothers in Christ. Poor among the poor. Do you want a chair? Could you make some room? Thank you. - In nomine Patris et Filii et Spiritus Sancti. - Amen. - Enjoy your meal. - Thank you. - Something to drink? - A coffee. Sister. A coffee and my water. - Your son isn't baptized. - A bad start... For pity's sake, no preconceived ideas. Your testimony has as much worth... ...as that of believers. If not more. - Supposing that I testify. - Of course. Thank you. After the crime, your brother Egidio... ...said he killed your mother in her sleep... ...in a sort of frenzy, under the effect... Do you mind speaking here? - No. - Fine. In his sleep, under the effect of psychotropics. Erminio and Ettore, in a more recent testimony... ...for the ecclesiastical authority, affirm, on the contrary... ...that Egidio killed her for begging him not to blaspheme. - Ettore testified? - The pentito? - Yes. - Yes. This discrepancy can be decisive... ...in the case of canonization. Martyrdom only occurred in the second case. Especially, as Ettore and Erminio claim, your mother died... ...forgiving her murderer. Without her pardon, no sainthood. Alas, Egidio neither confirms nor denies... ...his first account. As you know... ...he refuses to speak. Which is why we've called you... ...hoping to establish the truth, whatever it might be. I wasn't living at home then. I can't help. Why did your brother hate your mother so much? - Any theories? - I hated her as well... ...but never dreamt of killing her. You hated your mother. - Why? - Because she was stupid. I say that with no contempt. She was stupid. She understood nothing. - She'd always ask: "What do you want?" - Is that strange? You don't ask a child, "What's wrong with you? Don't do this..." "...don't do that". Not if there's no conviction behind your words. "Don't blaspheme." Fine but what else do you do? Did you see your mother... ...plead with him... ...sobbing on her knees at his door? I didn't see her kneeling or crying. Complaining, yes. But never crying. Did she manage to calm him, to stop him? Far from it. He'd howl louder. Bloodcurdling howls. My mother would plead, even threaten. Like all mothers. What else could she do? I don't want to remember. My brother's mad. He was and still is. And the blows? The daily martyrdom defined by a witness. You're smiling? - Laughing? - I'm not smiling. Okay, I smiled. I won't speak ill of my mother. - That's not the case. - I won't talk to you... ...about her. I reject you as judge. I don't want to testify. I don't believe in God. You say that with some fear. Your voice trembled. Imperceptibly. As if lightning could strike you. I told my son that yesterday. - But? - But what? Words aren't enough. You have to back them up with deeds. - As Christ did. - Other deeds. - For example? - Falling in love, for example. Loving someone is the best way... ...for me to declare my atheism. Not loving my neighbour... ...but falling in love with someone. A woman. My mother had no passion. Her passiveness, her lack of rebellion... ...against Egidio's illness, enduring it like an expiation... ...poisoned all of us. But I can't speak ill of her. I'm struck by your reserve. - I'm touched. - I have to go. - There's hope. - I have to go. - Wait. - Filippo Argenti. - You found him? - Yes, I did. He says his incurable disease was cured... ...by praying to your mother. His medical files confirm... ...that he is cured. Totally and permanently cured according to the patterns... ...defining miracles. - Lucky man. Can we trust him? On the train... ...a Romanian prostitute drugged and robbed him... ...leaving him almost naked at the station. You're smiling. I don't want to testify... ...orjeopardize his career as someone saved. I really have to go. Where is he? In Rome with our driver. He had nothing left. He needed a suit... ...for tomorrow's Papal audience. You'll need a suit and tie too. - You didn't know? - Not at all. I must go. - Hello? - When's school out? - At one thirty. - Right. Thank you. - You're welcome. - Hi, Ernesto. - Carlo, how are you? Leonardo will be glad to see us both. How did it go? You knew I saw the cardinal? The religion teacher? Didn't you see her? I did. You know the cardinal? Irene, who's side are you on? - I'm thinking of Leonardo. - I don't understand. Couldn't it be useful in the future... ...to have a saint for grandmother? - You thought of that? Take off your rucksack. - Coming to lunch? - I'm going to my studio. Aunt Maria wants to see you. It's urgent. - Will you be at the fencing class? - And aunt Maria? - Don't forget dinner tonight. - I won't. - Hello? - Good morning. - I have to take you to Mrs Picciafuoco's. - I'm coming. - Good morning. - Good morning, Ernesto. How are you? Renata, I'm sorry. Did you have your hair cut? - I'll tell your aunt you're here. - Thank you. Good morning. Your aunt woke up. Your aunt's waiting for you. - Hello. How are you? - Fine. We have to invent the life of a nonexistent saint. I checked out your web-site last night. It's very complete. Tell me. Did you get Irene into all this? She's desperate. You're not going to leave her? - That would be so stupid. - Why? For Leonardo's sake. It'd be more hypocritical than being together... ...since you're good people, incapable of cruelty. Hear me out. - Want something to drink? - No, thank you. The Picciafuoco family no longer has any social standing. It has no protector. It needs one? Without a protector, a father, a godfather... ...or a patron saint, you're nothing. You need a father figure. Masons, Opus Dei, the Gramsci Institute... ...the Marches Association, Hunters Society... ...lay brothers, War Veterans... ...and Orphans. To find a father figure... ...the family has to obtain a title. A title that will offer dignity, prestige and identity. You're risking anonymity. The void. This title is your mother's canonization. This state of social isolation has to end. Your children must return to the privileged position... ...that your disastrous ideals reduced to ashes. Stop sacrificing your children. For you... St Anthony's chain letter. - The same as ever? - Why not? Why don't we tell parents to fuck off? Definitively, absolutely... Shame on you, still talking like that! You're so wrong! I won't discuss it anymore. Let's get personal. Three years of plotting... ...before telling me. Why? Tell me why. You have to convert. Erminio's sure. Ettore has given in. The three of you have to convince Egidio to talk. - To tell the truth. - To lie. What does it matter... ...if he killed her in her sleep or not? You're an artist. Can't you see... ...the advantages of having a saint for a mother? Don't you feel enthusiastic? Doesn't it inspire you? A sainted mother. Manna for your poor imagination. Egidio worships you. For him, you're pure. Persuade him to talk. If he wants, he'll understand. At least if he changed character... Savonarola, for example. A religious fanatic. But not a blasphemer. - You're smiling? - No, I'm not. I'll never smile again! No need to raise your voice. I can see your smile... ...you know, mocking everyone. Your mother's smile. But she was obedient and you're not. You act superior, play the rebel. But you're nothing. You're never on TV... ...and they invite any horse's ass! - Forget it. Tell me, though. You despised my mother. You never set foot in church. Why are you doing all this? More than five billion people... ...out of six billion, believe in heaven. Are they all wrong? I don't believe but I'm fallible. So just in case, like many others, I'm taking out insurance. It doesn't cost anything. If God exists, he'll forgive. - I've got to go. - Where? - You dare to ask me that? - You dare to ask me that? - Which suit are you wearing? It's not a joke. Have one of my husband's. Almost new. Not a dead man's suit. What if I don't come? - You'd be crazy, criminal. - Why? Because you're not even sure. Leonardo would be lost. Enjoy life a little more instead of being a moralist. Get a mistress. Let your conscience go hang... ...and you won't have time to complain. Leave Leonardo out of this. Add more blood. Get ready! Raise your arm... Francesco, stab her. Try to look violent, aggressive. And you smile, like a saint. Okay. Do you mind giving me a little more room? Hands apart, Ada. Stab her again. Again. Get close with the dagger. Stab her. Fine, like that. Stay still. Both of you. Well done! Stop! Go and sit down. - It's your turn. - Hi, dad. Starting position. On guard. Forehand guard. - Hello? - It's Ettore. Hi. Too bad. Erminio wants us to meet first. - Let him cool off. - Even only for 10 minutes. We'll meet at the clinic. Mamma cried, prayed, and you killed her. She begged you not to blaspheme. I swear, Ettore as well. Do it for the family... ...to bring us back together. Trust us. We're brothers. We wouldn't go against you. - Thirsty, Egidio? - It's just a few words. You only have to say yes or no. Not even. A nod will do. You'll die angry, then? Heaven for Mamma and hell for you? It costs nothing to believe. It's insurance. - Life insurance. - What? - An insurance policy? You all say the same thing. Stop pissing us off, okay. If Mamma's a saint... ...down here life will change. Wealth, women, cars, everything. You'll be somebody, you'll have an image. You won't be some obscure killer but a famous penitent. You'll never be alone. People come up to me... ...asking me to intercede. Young women, beautiful. You'll be a celebrity. You have the stature for it. You'll guard your own sanctuary. Millions! A brilliant ending! The modern catharsis to a ruined life! But it has to be official. Recognized by the Church. Mamma has to enter the list of saints. What do I need to tell him? What'll it change? Your nonsense is beating him senseless. You're driving him over the top. Is that so? Go fuck yourself! You're only making things worse. Since the Church, the Pope... ...and my wife... Let me have my say. You decided on her canonization... ...why do you give a shit about his confession? - It's necessary! - What is necessary? - It's strategic! - Strategic? What the fuck! What a farce! For you. For me? For everyone. For me, it's different. I'm just starting to breathe. I'm just ridding myself of the stench of death. You've converted, I hear. I had to, to survive. Here, I've got work. I'm even back in the Medical Association. I can't find the strength to start a new life. I cling to the little things. Newspaper, coffee, cigarettes. Just to get up in the morning. Here I'm doing okay. No sermons. They're all beaten rebels like me. You're more pessimistic than ever. Thank you. - I smoke too much. - I quit. You still fuck? - Of course. Why? - With Irene? We've separated. - I'm in love. - And still as wild? Loving doesn't mean you're dumb. Really in love or imagining it? - They say... - I'm not "they". I envy you. - Since when? - This morning. - Who is it? - Leonardo's religion teacher. She's so beautiful. A beautiful religion teacher... That's what I thought too. Well, she's either frigid or a nympho. Curzio Sandali, architect. My brother. - Gaspare Gambardella. - It's an honour to meet you. - Aren't you Sisini? - I was yesterday. In love with a beautiful woman? Beauty. They say it drives you mad. Personally, ugliness does. - May I? - Yes, of course. - Ernesto? - Have a seat. A mad genius. When I passed the National Monument... ...I'd lose control. They thought I was a nihilist, an anarchist. No one saw the Monument's ugliness sickened me. And not what it stood for. I couldn't stand it. I felt its ugliness had inhibited... ...the world's architects... ...that it had frightened and terrorized them. - I have to go. - I decided... ...to blow it up. - The Monument? - Yes, the Monument. So it would vanish. But it was way too much for me. I fell ill. Bloody hell! God be damned! Stop. Pull up here. I'll meet you later. Since our mother was devoted to Padre Pio... ...she wrote him a letter... ...asking him to pray to ask God for a cure. I remember. There was a slight improvement. But alas, quite soon... Miracles, alas, don't happen every day. - Are you ready, Irene? - Yes, let's begin. Aunties, Erminio, Ettore. - How'd you get in? - The door was open. I saw you looking at my paintings. Why were you hiding? I didn't want to influence you. Tell me the truth. I'm not afraid. Of what? Your opinion. You don't like them? You expect me to talk about this now? Talking about painting would be grotesque. I have to go. I promised Leonardo I'd say goodnight. Wait for me. I'll be back. We should have expected Egidio not to say anything. That was no surprise. It was Ernesto's attitude that bothered me. Not only me, I think. He was completely uninvolved... ...and didn't cooperate at all. - At last! - Leonardo? - Ernesto! Ernesto! - Later. - Here I am. Give me a kiss. - Hi, dad. - Give me a kiss. What's wrong? Don't go. Ernesto's here. He's with Leonardo. Trust him. We're going to see the Pope. Who told you? Guido and Lucia. They're going. Aren't we invited? Yes, we're invited too. Remember what I said yesterday. - I don't believe in God. - And the Pope? He's God's representative on earth. - Coherence... - What's coherence? Doing what you say you will. Saying one thing and doing another... ...isn't coherent. So I can only go if I believe? You've got nothing to do with all this. One day you might ask: "Why did papa say one thing..." "...and do another?" That's all. So I can go? - Do you want to? - My cousins are going. I met your religion teacher. Now I know why you're so interested. - Ah, you know? - She's beautiful. - Beautiful?! Not beautiful. Very beautiful. - But daddy... - More beautiful than that. She's ugly. Everyone says so. - What's her name? - Ida Lappi. - Diana Sereni. - No, dad. Ida Lappi. - Diana Sereni is her name. - Who's Diana Sereni? - She knows you. She thinks a lot of you. - Are you upset? - No. Don't be afraid. I'm not afraid. No-one ever tells me: "You're the one who's right, papa". No-one ever tells me I'm right. Go to sleep, now. Go to sleep, it's late! Go to sleep. Go to sleep. ...guilty. Hi. Diana! Diana! It's Ettore. Are you here? Ernesto! Ernesto! It's Filippo! Don't you remember me? I took you on church outings. You're hiding? Ernesto, it's me, Filippo. Why are you running away? - What's up? - Something wrong? Need something? What's on your mind? I'm thinking about a woman, who fooled me. Before you were even together? Maybe she's part of the plan. - What plan? - The plan. Aunt Maria said something... ...I paid no attention to. "Take a mistress and stop playing the moralist." - So? - They planted her at my place. - She's at your place? - She's gone. They landed me with the religion teacher. - To convert me. - Like St Thomas's father. St Thomas's father sent... ...a prostitute to his son in secret. I don't understand. A woman. - How could that convert you? - Filippo understood. So I'd be a sinner, a hypocrite. - Like you. - And you're not happy? A beautiful woman in love and you complain. You could have a beautiful mistress... ...without paying a cent, and you complain. I paid, I didn't even get inside her... ...I ended up stark naked. And you complain! Go sin and make it snappy. Why is it always the rich who get richer? Show some sympathy! You cross yourselves too. Giovanni, stop. I have to get out. Our country's heroes. Get out. We have to take a photo. Giovanni, come. Let's take a photo. A big smile. A big smile. Come on! That's it. - Let's go. - Thank you. - The door's open. - Yes. - Did thieves get in? - Get the champagne and glasses. Come and have a seat. - Where's the TV? - It's there. I want to catch the news. - The door was open? - What? It was open. - Get the champagne and the glasses. - Good idea! Let's drink. ...a few yards farther over. - Come into my studio. ...and leads towards... Come. Let's drink a toast. Just one. I've got a few words that'll make a good toast. Just a few words. More or less the following: Convert as soon as you can. And all the best to Ernesto! Cheers! Cheers! - You like that? - How much did they pay you? - How much? - Don't mix sacred and profane. You're healed. Now they can cancel your pension. You realize that? No. You're wrong. A miracle cure can be a goldmine. Visual rights, TV appearances, gifts. Revenge... ...after a lifetime as a pathetic buffoon. I'm Filippo Argenti... ...no more, no less. Certainly, not the famous painter... ...Ernesto Picciafuoco. - Go to hell. I was poor and still am. I'm not ashamed. One plus one makes zero. What is it? Excuse me. Count Ludovico Bulla. Your behaviour... ...has stained my honour. The code of chivalry deems you the offender. We'll settle this disagreement with arms. Is this a joke? - A smile... - Did you really offend him? Three people caught me smiling. Cardinal Piumini, Count Bulla... ...and aunt Maria. My smile, yours, Erminio's. Even Eugenio's. My mother's smile. The indifferent, lethal smile... ...saying she owns you because she gave birth to you. A smile I could never rip off my face. - The smile of a smart ass, of a failure. - What?! My mother's a murderer. In fact, she killed Egidio... - What are you talking about? ...who never smiles. - You're crazy! - Forget it. He's raving. - I don't want to smile. - Your mother's a saint! I was healed by invoking her. Me, a poor sinner. She healed me... ...shielded me through life... ...and I'm covered in heaven. She's a star. An angel! I don't have money... ...talent, skills or a family. Stop it, Filippo. Holy Mother, protect him. I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son... ...and the Holy Ghost. Amen. Knowing there was a revolutionary process... ...created a dramatic misunderstanding. The student movement believed... ...that it was a revolution dictated by the orders... - It's five o'clock. - Let's get to bed. - What time's the audience? - At eight thirty. - I'll drive you home. You need to rest. - Just a moment. I need seconds. - Are you serious? - Yes, I am. - I have to go. - Are you sure? - Yes. - What are you talking about? - The duel. - The duel? - You can be a second. - Without papers? No need. Will there be a doctor? I think so. If the duel takes place. - What? - There won't be anyone there. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. Take your positions. Let's check the weapons. - What do I do? - This protects your carotid. Count Bulla. - I'm cold. - You want yourjacket? - He took his off. - He has... ...warm underwear. Don't worry. Stay on the defensive, keep your distance... ...with a tree between you. There are no trees. Try to wear him down. He's old, he won't last long. Like the Horaces and Curiaces. There's still time for a friendly agreement. - It's the last chance. - Too late for apologies. I'm not here to apologize. Since there's no agreement... ...we'll let the weapons decide. Greeting! Good. Just distance. Weapon arm extended. Lower arms. On guard, gentlemen. Begin! Enough. - What? It's not enough! - Enough. - I want to fight. - No. - Hi, guys. - Hi, Leo! - How are you? - Fine. - Fine. Genuflection. Levate. So? Are you afraid? We're seeing the Holy Father. His Holiness is waiting. Go. - Go on, killer. - See you, dad. - See you.
