- Kilian, time to go. - Coming. Always remember me as I am now. I shall do the same with you. Good luck. My luck runs out here and now. Goodbye. Farewell. Eternal rest grant unto Jacobo de Rabaltué, O Lord And let perpetual light shine upon him. May his soul and the souls of all the faithful departed, through the mercy of God, rest in peace. Come on, it's a bit quieter in here. We had so many things left to say. Dad... I should have come earlier. How's your father? He has good days when he seems to be alright... and others when he isn't. He seems to lose it, saying things I don't understand about Bioko, the plantation... It's as if the past is more real than the present. Sometimes he looks at me like he doesn't even know me. And sometimes I'm not sure I know him either. I know exactly what you mean. Last week the lawyers from the ski resort were here again. They want to finalise the purchase of our land as soon as possible so they can start building in the spring. And, well, we need your signature to finalise the sale. I think I put the contract over here. Clarence, I know this isn't the best time, but the sooner we get this over with, the better. Here... - What's this? - My father's diary. - Sorry. - It's OK. - Daniela. - What? Kilian. Coming. Dad, hey. Hi. Again? My daughter, I'm so sorry. I'm sorry. - Could you help me, Clarence? - Yes. OK, done. I don't understand you, Dad... but it sounds very pretty. Daniela, stay with me. Yes, Dad. Julia. - You really didn't have to. - It's no bother. Would you like a cup of hot chocolate? The day I say no to that is the day you can start worrying! While I was sorting through some papers in the office... I found part of a letter that looks like it was sent from Africa. Forgive me. An old woman's sentimental nonsense. It's my husband's handwriting. Do you know who he's talking about? He mentions a woman and some children they used to send money to... I can read, Clarence. I had a look at the accounts... and it looks like regular payments were sent from here. - Maybe you should ask your uncle. - He's in no condition to talk. I wouldn't want anyone important to be forgotten about. Julia, what's wrong? If we hadn't had to leave the way we did... I don't think I would've moved back to Pasolobino. And my father? Would he have liked to have stayed too? Your father was never one to show his feelings. I know that better than anyone. Well, perhaps my mother, but she didn't seem to be a particularly happy woman. I've decided to go to Bioko. It's been almost forty years since we left. You won't like what you find. - It doesn't matter. - The Fernando Poo we knew is gone. Also, it's a very dangerous trip for a woman travelling on her own. There's no way I'm going to be able to talk you out of it, is there? You know, Clarence, to the Bubis, nothing is as important as honoring your ancestors. Remember that. When you get to Sampaka ask for Simón. He was Kilian's houseboy for all those years and he was also Manuel's contact for the money that was being sent to Guinea this whole time. He might put you in touch with someone just a little older than you called Fernando. It shouldn't be too hard, that place is as small as this valley. I will make sure she gets your money. She and her children are fine thanks to what you send. January 18th, 1954. Dear Catalina... I stared at our house's façade as if I was trying to memorise every detail. Kilian! Hurry up! You've still got time. Don't worry about me, I'm fine. Come on. There are no men left in our house. If only it wasn't so far away. Six thousand kilometers is nothing, Mum. We should continue on skis. We'd better say goodbye now. Just in case you get hungry. I'm really going to miss you. Write in this when you think of me. That way I can read everything when you get back. Thank you. - Take care of your brother. - Yes. Come back soon. Goodbye, Mum. I don't understand why this language is written one way and pronounced another. You won't have to write to the Nigerians. I've underlined everything you need to know. Jacobo, what do you know about life in this country? Nothing. I can't wait to see the sea. February 2, 1954. Dear Catalina, there's not long left until we reach Guinea. We ran into Manuel Ruiz on board. I already knew him from Santa Isabel Hospital. He's going to be the new doctor on the estate. I can't wait to get to my birthplace and discover indigenous Guinea. The real Guinea. If anything is left of it. What do you think? He's speechless! See all those black people? They're all the same. Just like sheep, you won't be able to tell them apart until a few months from now. Father. Jacobo. - Welcome to your birthplace, Son. - Thank you. How are you? Are you alright? Yes, I'm fine. This last campaign was harder than we expected. This suitcase is full of things Mum packed for you. I am sure you'll be feeling better in no time. Good afternoon. This is my son Kilian and that's Manuel, the estate's new doctor. Welcome. And thank you for the package. First lesson, Kilian, you have to keep the guards happy. Every now and again give them cigarettes, whisky, eggs, whatever. The happier you keep them, the faster they'll come when you need them. Enough lessons. And let Osë drive. I don't think the boss would like to see you driving his car. Garuz won't know, will he, Osë? Come on. Everything appears to be in order. How is it that a young man with a promising future like you prefers the colony to Madrid? Thank you. Well, my second vocation is Botany. I'd like to study the local plant species and their medical applications. I'm not sure you'll have time for that. And you, young man? We need energetic and decisive people around here. You'll spend the first two weeks focussed on learning. Observe your colleagues, do as they do. You'll be going to Obsay with Gregorio. But won't he with me at Yacato? Obsay is not working as well as it should. A new person will be good. Yes, sir. Treat the workers with authority but also justice. If you don't resolve issues properly, you'll lose their respect. Thank you, Mr Lorenzo. - Antón, who is his houseboy? - Simón, the new one. Don't let him get away with anything or he will come and go as he wishes. That will be all. - Good morning. - Thank you very much. Obey. I order you. Come here. I am the boss. I am the boss. Work. You get to work! - Massa the drum is sounding, wake up. - I'm coming. One moment. I'm coming! One moment! Simón, Massa. At your service. It's still night time. When the work starts it will be daytime. In 10 minutes everybody will have to be standing outside. - I'll help you get dressed. - Thanks, I can do it alone. - I'll help. - I'll do it! Give me that. Come on. Another minute and you won't get paid. - Good luck. - That man who's coming with dad... - is Gregorio. - Good morning. You'd better behave with my boy. Another Rabaltué. The whole family will be here soon. Let's go, father. Bye. 20 men per brigade. Start counting. I am sick, Massa. Every day the same old story! Get to work. Lies. They always lie. Come on. Excuses and superstitions. What do you think your brother is carrying around that melongo rod for? The owner wants his profits and it's our job to see that he gets them. You're in charge of those... What the...? - Snake! Snake! - What's the hell's wrong? Snake! Get up there and kill it. Get up there! Is this what you're afraid of? This? Send the injured to hospital. The rest go back to work. Come on, work harder! How is your first day going? What are these songs about? About work. Working and not thinking. What's wrong? You like watching? I'm sorry. You left me halfway. None of that. This time doesn't count. Don't veer off the path. You wouldn't last more than a couple of hours in the jungle. Kilian! Don't you remember me? - Julia. - Yes. Forgive me, you look so... - You've grown a lot too. We were... - I don't know. Ten years old? Has it been that long since we last saw each other? - How are you? - Very well, come in. - How are your parents? - They're doing really well. I keep promising myself I'll go back to Pasolobino, but for one reason or another I end up not going. I always ask Jacobo about the mountains. - By the way, is he back? - Yes, but... Here he is. Hi, Julia. How are you? How are you doing? - Very well, you? - Very good. - Did you enjoy your vacations? - Fantastic. Didn't you miss us even a little? Well, we're in a big hurry today. Let me see... My parents are organizing a farewell dinner for Dámaso, the doctor. You could come over too, it's going to be fun. Kilian looks like he needs a break from the forest. We'd be happy to. You idiot. Marvelous. - What's wrong? - Nothing. I'm going to put this in too for the mosquito bites. - OK. - It works wonders. - Thank you. - Let me see. Jacobo. Look at how happy they are. Just dying to spend their wages in Santa Isabel. Look. And we have to go to a stupid dinner because you can't say "no". - Julia is a charming girl. - They're all charming, Kilian. Until they tie you down. Come on, cheer up. Father! Wow... Are we late? No, no. I was on the balcony and when I saw you I came down. - You look great. - Thank you. Well... You've chosen a good time to leave, Dámaso. New found independence from Kenya to Belgian Congo won't take long to reach Guinea. You're getting to know this country in troubling times. I read on the boat about the Mau Mau movement. Can you leave the conversation of politics for another day, please? Tell me, Kilian, how are Mariana and Catalina? - They miss us. - Sure. I need you to help me convince my father to take a holiday. Listen to your son, Antón. I can't even think how lonely they must feel on their own. When the season is over. Stop making excuses and decide on a date. You are a father and a husband to them. It's not only about sending money home. Looks like the food is going down well, Jacobo. - Congratulations to the cook. - Don't look at me. You've got her sitting in front of you. Julia. Excuse me for a second. Well... Excuse me. Julita. Mr Dámaso, have you said goodbye to everyone? I believe so. But to everyone though? Because I know someone who'll be very sad tonight. Like the rest of them will be too. You leave a footprint wherever you tread. They mean Regina, a friend of Dámaso's for many years. Doesn't he have a wife and children in Spain? Spain is very far away. Let the man who is free of sin cast the first stone, right, Father? If you stayed away from women and drink, your health and wallet would appreciate it. Not to mention your spirits. Mind whose company you keep, young man. Thanks, Julia. If we haven't known each other since we were children, I might think I was making you nervous. No, it's my father. I think he feels a bit down. Yes, I think so too. Massa Jacobo. Massa Jacobo. What happens? Some men were having a party in the barrack huts and suddenly a fight broke out with machetes and all. We need someone to handle the situation. There are injured people. As it's Saturday there are no white people to put things in order, not even the doctor. Damn! Mr. Emilio, Generosa... Come on, Kilian. I'm really sorry. - We were having a great night. - First things first. There will be other occasions. - Of course. Come on, Kilian. - Hurry up. - Emilio will drive your father. - Don't worry, I'll take care of him. - You take care. - Take care, please. Wait. Thank you! Good evening! Come on, Kilian. - Good job, Nelson. - You're shameless. Welcome to Santa Isabel's nights. We're on our way, Anita Guau! - Good evening, Jacobo! - Hey! - Hello! - Well look who's here. - We've missed you, Jacobo. - Me too, darling. - This is my brother Kilian. - Welcome. Enjoy! That's what we came for! You already drunk? Look, look. Black label. The best whisky and cheaper than beer. Advantages of being a free port. The rest is nonsense. Come on, follow me. - Jacobo - Anita Guau! Kilian, come on. Where are they from? Corisquenians, Nigerians, Fang and Ndowé from the Muni river. - A bit of everything. - And Bubis? Bubis no way. If they lose their virginity they're punished. You mean...? Look, look, who's coming our way. Oba, Sade. Come sit at our table. Hello, guys! Where have you been? I was missing you. Today we were told that some natives have eaten a bishop. A sect or something. Did you hear anything? You whites are so scared of being eaten by us. But then you come here to spend your money. The bishop is a monkey. Pao, any luck? She went off someone younger. I give up. I'll just have to have another drink. Drink with us. Let's dance. Look at them. Don't mind them. Just go with the flow. What's wrong? Are you afraid that I'll eat you up? You want to join us? April 24, 1954. Mother, Catalina, we are working from dusk till dawn. The land here is so fertile that we have to weed the fields every day so that the vegetation doesn't invade the cocoa. Manuel always comes over when he has some free time to study the local plant life. And on our days off, we tend to escape to Santa Isabel with Dick and Pau, Jacobo's friends. I still haven't been able to make friends with the natives. Even though I was born here, I feel that they see me as just another outsider. Maybe this could change in time. Your son and brother who misses you, Kilian de Rabaltué. - Emilio. - Kilian, how are you? - Gustavo? - Kilian? Would you excuse me a second? Sorry. Thank you. Are you expecting someone? Actually, I am. - Nelson. - Nelson? I suppose he won't be long in rescuing you from this boring party. What you're talking about? There was no fight at the estate. I can imagine where you went off to in such a hurry. As far as I know, you're not my girlfriend, you can't control me. Julia. Let's dance. Forgive me for what happened the other day and for stepping on your toes. Don't worry. I'm not the most gifted dancer either. And not as skilled as the miningas, at least this dance is free. Julia, don't compare yourself with them. You guys can do as you please and no one dares to judge you. We girls have to wait until you get tired of flings and come back to get a good, loyal wife, at home, locked up. Because you have a name for women who behave as you do, right? All this is new to me. What would you think of me if I gave myself to anyone I felt like every weekend? This conversation is not appropriate for... For a woman. Julia. Wait a second, please. - Manuel. - Yes? He's the estate's doctor. Julia is the daughter of my parents' friends. A pleasure. Have we seen each other before? I often come here to swim and on Sundays I'll play cards. That must be it, I usually come too. Do you want something to drink? - Thanks. - No, thanks. I wasn't expecting this, Gustavo! Enough! Emilio! I've sacrificed my whole life on this land so that my family could have a better life. I won't put up with being threatened! You've exploited us long enough! Sooner or later you'll have to go! - Enough, Dad. - Ungrateful, that's what you are! Enough! Look at me. Enough. Please. Gustavo, forgive him. He loves this island so much that he gets very upset when they call him a foreigner. I hope you can see that. Forgive him, please. Dad, don't allow politics to damage so many years of friendship. Come on. Listen to her. Please. Let's go home. Come on. Come on, Emilio. Dad, let's go home. She's a special girl. Not now, Simón. - Come on, wake up. - What's wrong, Dad? The casino, Santa Isabel... You've been here for more than a month and that's all you've seen. I won't let you waste your time as your brother does. Get up. Come on, get up. Osë is waiting for us. - Too much party last night? - Not really. It's just... I feel out of place. I miss my home. This is your home, Massa Kilian. It looks like we have arrived in time. It's a male. Once it leaves for the sea, it will never again set foot on land. When the times comes, the female turtles come back to this beach - to lay their eggs. - How do they find their way back? One never forgets where one was born. Massa Antón, Massa Antón, we want sweets! I don't have any. Hi, hi. Your father comes here from time to time for our special oils. They're good for exhaustion. Come, I'll introduce you to my friends. I have a message for Massa Jacobo, I have a message for Massa Jacobo. I have a message for Massa Jacobo. Hello, I have a message for Massa Jacobo. - Can I help you, miss? - Yes, I have a message... Why is everything so dark? An electricity problem. Park just before you reach the house. The Nigerians have filled the main courtyard. Thank you. - Remember the other day when... - Wait. Marcial. Julia. Manuel, what's all this about? The laborers have organized a forest rat hunt. - Hunting grompis? In the dark? - There's a party in the courtyards. The jungle at night is full of mystery. Do you want to have a look? Well, well. What are you doing here this late? I was going to the cinema and... To the cinema? You took a pretty big detour then? Yes, but I remembered on my way that Manuel had invited me to the hunt. Shall we? - You want some? - Thank you. - Cheers, Father. - Hello. Kilian. Be careful! It's delicious. This is no place for a woman. Oh, Jacobo, don't be so old-fashioned. You remind me of Mariana when she was young. How's my daughter doing at hospital? Does she give you much trouble? No, no! She's a fast learner. I think it'll be easy to persuade Garuz to hire her. How did this get into my bedroom? Who paid you to do it? Tell me! Who paid you, Simón? - I'm talking to you. - Umaru! I saw Umaru coming down the stairs. That's why I came to see you. Clean my bedroom! Now! Jacobo, Jacobo! - Umaru? - He's there. Don't let him move! Don't move. What were you doing in my room? What is he saying? What is he saying? He says he's been at the party the whole time. Bring me the rod. Bring me the rod! Father, let him do it. Hold him. You too, hold him. Hold him! Turn him around. That's enough, Massa. Stop. The boy will tell you everything. He found a nest of bitis in the cocoa trees. He called Massa Gregor so that he could kill it but Massa Gregor... Congratulations. You're now almost like me. You'll do well on the island. Kilian. Kilian. Father! Look at me. Look at me. Manuel! Open your eyes, Kilian! Where am I? - Kilian, I didn't think you'd make it. - What happened? What could it be? The bitis bit you. But if you're awake that means you're out of danger. You really scared us. Come on, men! Come on! Mother, Catalina, I can't believe it, but my first season has ended. Apparently it's one of the best harvests they've had in years. Julia has become very good friends with Manuel, the estate's doctor. I wouldn't be surprised if we hear wedding bells any day now. By the way, Osë is taking father and I to his daughter's wedding. I'll try to convince father to take some vacation because I know he really misses you two. - What's your son-in-law called, Osë? - Mosi. How did they fall in love? What did I say? He's telling her she must always be faithful to her husband, like sand on the beach that may only be washed by one sea. He wishes them happiness and strength on their new journey. She's asking Mosi to never abandon his wife in spite of the many other wives he may have. How can you understand their language, Father? I spend a lot of time with them. I've witnessed many weddings like this one. May the spirits bless your marriage with many children. - What should I say? - Whatever you want. Something sweet. She's been very kind to me, and to you. I hope you'll both be very happy. Let's go. Massa Kilian! What's wrong? What's wrong, Simón? It's Massa Antón. They found him passed out in the office. He's sedated now. I've given him a higher dose of morphine. Higher? For months now he's been taking morphine to ease the pain. Kilian, your dad has an illness that can't be cured. We can't operate. He only has a matter of days. I'm sorry. Did you know about this? Osë. He made me swear not to say anything. It's in God's hands now. God does not send the illness. God is the creator of beautiful things. Illness is sent by the spirits of our ancestors when we don't honor them as we should. I don't know what the hell you're doing in a hospital instead of in the jungle invoking your spirits. Jacobo. What cannot be avoided, cannot be avoided. Here, at least we can help him with the pain. I feel useless. You take care of my father in a way that I've never been taught. I don't even dare touch him. If it were your father on that bed, what would you do? I'd let the doctor who has always taken care of him come and visit him. Father. It's Kilian. I was walking in the snow with my father. Soon I'll be back with my loved ones. If you were so ill, why didn't you go home? - Do you remember the turtles? - Yes. Once they leave for the sea, they never again set foot on land. I have also chosen where I want to die. But mother... I didn't want her to see my lifeless body. God has chosen me to go first. And I'm grateful. Is there anything you want me to tell her? There's nothing she doesn't already know. Well, yes. Tell her I'll be waiting for her in the place where I'm going. I've seen that place in my dreams, Kilian. That witch doctor opened my eyes. Life is a tornado. Peace, fury... and then peace again. Father. Jacobo. Jacobo. Jacobo, I know... I know nothing I say could ever console you, but I want you to know that I'm here if you need anything. Don't you ever do that again! I'm engaged to Manuel. But you don't love him. I spent half my life chasing you down and you had to wait until Manuel showed up to realise that I was here. You're going to ruin your life, Julia. I waited so long for you, Jacobo. It's time I started living. And you should do the same. Julia! I'm afraid I can't help you. My uncle has Alzheimer's and he's no longer able to manage by himself. And my father passed away a few days ago. I don't know... If someone important to them were having problems, I couldn't forgive myself. If you could put me in contact with Simón, I might be able to find them. He was my uncle's houseboy and the contact between my family... And the woman mentioned in the letter. Concerning the dates you mentioned, I don't think he works here anymore. If you have a look at the files that my father kept you might find what you're looking for. - Are you the new secretary? - No. I'm looking for documents from when my father worked here. You're the daughter of a colonist. Employee of the estate, it's not the same thing. I see you haven't wasted any time. Did you find anything interesting? Not much really. I have to close up now, but if you can come back another day. Iniko can take you back to the hotel, right? I'd always imagined this place under a blazing sun. That is because you know nothing about this land. And the little I've heard is all lies. I heard Bubis were charming and hospitable people. My hotel is that way. I have to pick someone up from the airport. I'm late. I'll leave you at the hotel afterwards. - Hi. - Man, what's up? - How are you? - Good. Good? - How's everything? - Good. - Hi, I'm Laha. - Clarence. Nice to meet you. Do you want me to sit in the back? Don't worry, I'll go sit there. What are you doing in Malabo? Let me guess... - Volunteer for some NGO? - No. - UN envoy sent to write up a report? - No. Businesswoman, engineer... Iniko, give me a hint. Researcher. No, I'm a professor of Linguistics. I'm here to look at the level of Spanish spoken in Guinea. And how is it? I don't know yet, I've just arrived. - Are you on holiday? - Yes and no. Let's see. I study Engineering in Madrid. We have a lot of oil and gas here but it is extracted by foreign companies. Yeah. If more people had the same opportunities as me... Excuse my brother's manners. Is he your brother? - Didn't he tell you? - No. He's not a big conversationalist. Right, Iniko? What are you up to tonight? Nothing. Would you accept some Bubi hospitality to welcome you to Malabo? I'd be happy to. Well... - You'll see, you're going to have fun. - OK. You're going to like it. I'm sorry. - Is there a problem? - No. - No, I'm sorry. - What? Let's go, Clarence. You remind me of somebody. Someone I knew a long time ago. Be careful, you might find what you have come here for. Who's that woman? Mama Sade. The man with her is her son. They say his father is a white man she fell in love with, and then he left her. - What is his son's name? - What are you, a gossip? They're dangerous people. Don't get in trouble with them. Let's go. Come on! We will have a good time anyway. - Are you OK? - Yes, thanks. No, really. Come on. This is better than being in the hotel room. - Thanks for inviting me. - I didn't invite you. Don't look so much. Listen. Feel the music... here. Here. And here. See? It's not that difficult. What are you doing, Clarence? What are you thinking about? I'm running out of time and I haven't made any progress. Why did you come here? Tell me the truth. My dad passed away a few days ago. I think he kept in touch with someone here. My grandfather died here. I visited his grave and there were fresh flowers. Do you know a man called Simón - who is now around 65 years old? - No. Do you know his African name? No. Is that the Basile Peak? It's actually a volcano. In Bubi it's called Owässa. The Nigerian called it Big Pico and the British called it Clarence Peak. Did you know you were named after an African volcano? An extinguished volcano. It's dormant. Only it knows how alive it is inside. Where are we going? It's a surprise. What are you waiting for? Get out. Come, it's this way. What do you think? Every December thousands of sea turtles cross the Ocean Atlantic to come here and lay their eggs, the place where they were born. Look. That is the guardian of the island. It looks after the inhabitants of Ureka. An offering for the guardian. Come over here! I was in prison, Black Beach. What got you arrested? Being Bubi. They arrested hundreds. I was lucky and was released from prison. Others didn't survive. There are still so many things I don't understand about this place... My dad and uncle probably saw these palm trees grow. One day there'll be nobody to tell stories of palm trees in the snow. Look. Hold this. - You're not allowed to take photos. - Garuz told me I can. Just a second. Taking pictures is forbidden! We're leaving now. We're leaving now. Put the camera away. Let's leave before we get into trouble. That man saw you taking pictures. See? - Maybe one of them knows Simón. - Enough questions for today. I should have started there. - Wait. - Let me... Excuse me. Excuse me, I'll put it away. - I just want to ask something. - White girl! Go back to your country, we don't want white people here. Keep walking. Keep walking. - Now you have foreigner friends? - Fuck! Come on. Enough. Let me talk to him. He says you have the eyes of the people of your land. Everything is fine! Everything is fine! Let me deal with them. Who is he? He worked at the estate when this was a Spanish colony. Ask him if he's Simón. Do you understand me? You speak my language. He swore to never speak your language again, but yes, he understands you. Sometimes I'd prefer not to, though. What's he saying? He's asking, what brings you here. My grandfather Antón, my father Jacobo and my uncle Kilian worked on this land for many years. My dad passed away a few days ago and I came to visit my grandfather's grave, Antón de Rabaltué. Did you know him? He says my grandfather and yours were good friends. He asks you to send his regards to Massa Kilian and to tell him that life hasn't been as cruel as it could have been, in spite of everything. He says he will be glad to hear it. Yes, he will be glad to hear it. What blood divided, blood will unite. - Simón... - Let's go. - I need to find Fernando. - Let's go now! I need... Who's that Fernando you're looking for? My dad or my uncle used to send money to a woman here in Bioko for years. One of them had a son with her. I just know he is called Fernando. In those days, children were baptized with a Spanish name and an African name. Fernando is a very common name, but it's Laha's second name. Look. - Where did you get that picture? - I found it among my uncle's letters. That woman is my mother. I knew this day would come. Kilian... We lived really hard times. Thanks to him, we could get by. Surely, we wouldn't be here without his help. Mum. Kilian is my father? The spirits have decided that the time has come for my sons to know their story. The... The spirits? Didn't you heard their voice, Clarence? Why, if not, have you come to Bioko? My uncle stopped writing... as soon as my grandfather passed. This is my story, too. Please. Kilian went home and stayed there for almost three years. In that time, many things changed. The gods blessed me with a child and my life with Mosi became easier thanks to that gift. I missed you, Grandfather. Come meet him. Look! But when Kilian came back and we saw each other again... it was like all that time that we had been apart... Congratulations. Had never existed. What's his name? Iniko. Where you come from it means "born in difficult times". May I? I don't know your name yet. My name is Daniela Bisila. Congratulations, Mosi. Kilian! And to think that I have the son of a Bubi chief - as my houseboy. Don't I, Simón? - We'll see for how long. And what do you say, Osë? Do you want independence as well, like Simón and Gustavo? When two elephants fight, the one that suffers is the grass. That is all I know about politics. Let's go? - Let's go. - Let's go, Simón. What's wrong? Aren't you happy to see me? Where is my brother? Your brother is around, looking. He likes all of them. On the other hand, you are a one-woman man. I've shared you with other men; I owe you nothing. That I make a living the way I do doesn't mean I don't have feelings. Oi! Show some respect! Another round on me, damn it. Another round, my treat. Money's not a problem. Kilian. What are you doing here? What's wrong? Catalina? Mother? No, they're good. They send their love. Aren't you going to give me a hug? Of course I bloody will. Hey, I'm all right, yeah? I'm all right, it's just that this season is turning out to be a bit harder than expected. Stay where you are! Anybody gets close, I'm gonna blow his brains out! You better put the gun down. Put it down. Since when do we argue over a woman here? Don't you understand that you're not going to decide for us ever again? This is the real face of Whites! As long as you obey, everything will be all right. Stand up! You don't have enough bullets for everybody. There's a lot more of us. Gregorio. Gregorio, put the gun down. Put the gun down. We'll let you go. Nobody wants this to end badly. Hand it over. No ships come on Fridays. I came by plane at midday. And why didn't I see you? When I got here, I was told you were still at the cocoa fields. So I went to pay Osë a visit. When I came back, you had already gone and they told me... I've talked to Garuz. Now that I'm back, you'll be able to go home for a few months. It won't hurt you to get a bit of rest and fresh air, Jacobo. I'm glad to see you too, Kilian. Very glad. That's it. They're leaving us on our own. On our own! I was starting to think you weren't around any more. No, dear. With things the way they are, I thought you have left with Jacobo. He doesn't care about us. He's been in Pasolobino almost nine months. Isn't he coming back? I don't know. - Goodbye. - Bye. - Hey, ma'am! - Well! Not a single article about what is happening here. Nobody cares about the colonies back in Spain? To tell you the truth, I don't think they do. Dad, France and England have freed their colonies; Spain wasn't going to be any different. Nobody knows their place any more. Here, give it to me. Thank you, Generosa. And Manuel, how is he doing? - Good, he's really doing well. - Yeah? When he finishes at the plantation, he goes to visit the villages, so we don't get to relax. But he's good. Julia? Julia! Julia. What's wrong? It's Father Rafael. He called the hospital; he was really nervous. He says that a badly injured man came to the church, says he's a friend of yours. His name is Gustavo. Gustavo? But he was arrested months ago. We need to help him. But Garuz can't find out. Kilian, could you take us? Let's go. Good afternoon. Where are you coming from? We were visiting Father Rafael. We're headed to Sampaka. Is there a problem? And her? She is the farm nurse. There's a very ill man who we think will die. That's why we went to tell Father Rafael, to see if he could give him his last rites. It'd be best if you didn't leave Sampaka. Who did this to him? Truth is, could have been anyone. Spanish soldiers looking to set an example or... Or some local leader who considers him a dangerous opponent. Nobody is safe here any more. More bandages, please. What did you say to him? That he looks so ugly the spirits won't want to take him like this. When I'm finished with him, he will be the one to decide if he wants to go or not. Julia, go back home. I'll stay, don't worry. Are you sure? I'll be awake. Let me know when Bisila has finished, please. Kilian. He will be safer here. You did a good job. Thank you. You helped, too. Anybody would have done the same. No. Not anybody. Come. You should get back. It is probably Manuel. It's late. Good evening. I'm sorry you had to take care of this. How is he? Fine, he is resting now. Well, you can go then, I'll take it from here. Thank very much, Bisila. I knew it the very first time I heard your voice. As if you talked to a part of me I didn't know it existed. Like a spell. What have you done to me, Bisila? My body is not untouched. But my heart is. I give it to you. What is that song about? The one you were singing by the river. About springs that emerge from the earth unexpectedly to become rivers. About streams that split to rejoin again. About the sea that, in the end, welcomes us all. It talks about life's path. About destiny. Why where you crying, then? Well... Because I couldn't choose mine. As a child, they told me horrific stories about punishing adulterous women. They were strung up on trees, stones tied to their feet. Or they were buried up to their necks for the vermin to devour. I won't let anything bad happen to you. We will have to be very careful, Kilian. It will be our secret. We can't hope for anything more. I will always be with you. Always. See you later! I'm running out of excuses to come. Yesterday, Simón asked me rudely what was hurting me this time. Oh, yeah? And what did you tell him was hurting you? It's not there that hurts. - No? - No. You said it really well. - Really? - Yes. Now it's my turn. Not even half as bad as I can be. Yeah, Fernando Poo voted against independence, but it's a minimal margin. It's just a matter of time, Kilian. Sooner or later, we'll need to leave. Manuel, don't be a pessimist, please. With Gustavo in the council, we have a friend in the new party. - Don't we? - I wouldn't be so sure about that. What do you think, Kilian? I don't care who's in power. I only hope things stay as they are. Right, Ismael? Aren't we OK here? Massa Kilian. What's the matter, Simón? A telegram arrived. It's not good news. What's wrong, Kilian? Is it Jacobo? It's Catalina. She's very ill. They don't think she'll get better. They are asking me to go home, to say goodbye. Dear Catalina... I stared at our house as if I was trying to memorise every detail. Amá came close to me and strongly grabbed my arm. We struggled to walk forward, arm-in-arm, with our suitcase and skies. The snow was up to our knees. It didn't take us long to reach Jacobo. You were very cold. I warmed you up. We walked along the snowy streets. The mountain was full of snow. You were very sad. We were all fighting to hold back our tears and control our emotions. It was then that you gave me this diary. Kilian! You have mail! From Africa! Have you gone crazy? This is a hospital! A hospital for workers of this plantation! Don't stick your nose into other people's business! - What happened? - This was a warning! - How are you? - Fine. How is your mother? I won't tell you that she's fine, to be honest. But, since they saw it coming, she had time to come to terms with it. At least Kilian is going to stay with her for a while. And when will he come back? What, aren't you happy to see me? Don't be silly, Jacobo, of course I'm happy. What? Nothing, it's just... It's just that it doesn't seem like you to let others see you... vulnerable. I might be changing. You can't fool me, Jacobo. I'm sorry, but you can't fool me. You will never change. I've met someone special. Her name is Carmen. You don't know her, she's not from Pasolobino. Then I'm very happy for you. Truly. Although I can't say the same for her, huh? She's got a lot in store for her, poor girl. And how is it going with Manuel? Really well. He is a good husband. And look at me now, with two little ones. Who would have said that a couple of years ago, huh? I am very happy. It's OK, it's OK. It's OK, it's OK. It's OK, baby. Well, I'd better leave you alone. It seems like the little one is hungry. You can't fool me either, Julia. Leave. A young lady alone at this time? She's looking for something. Let me pass. I'm a nurse, they're waiting for me at the hospital. Stop, please. I'm sorry, I... It's not your fault, Clarence. Nothing of what happened is your fault. No one helped you? Bisila. Nobody can know. Do you hear me? Do you hear me? It can't come to light. A strong tug. I'm afraid I'll hurt you. Don't be afraid. You'll do it right. Stop, stop, stop. Kilian. Jacobo! Syphilis. How could he have caught syphilis, Manuel? He will stay with us for three weeks, that's if he responds well to the treatment. But he will need to be on medication for at least three months. Now, if you will excuse me, I have more things to do. Come on! Quick! Come on! Quick. We don't have all day. What happened to you? I was mowed down by a pick-up truck. My brother is very ill, you've got to help him. I know perfectly well what your brother has. I hope he dies. Bisila... Do you know them? Two white men murdered the old-fashioned way. Now they'll say that it's the spirits who don't want whites on the island. As if things weren't chaotic enough. Kilian. Tell your brother to be very careful. Is anybody going to tell me what's going on? Simón. I thought we were friends. I don't understand anything. Truly. I know something happened when I was in Pasolobino. Something that has to do with Dick and Pao. My brother? Bisila...? Osë, tell me it's not true. Mosi knows. I told him I saw Dick, Pao and Jacobo hanging around that night. Let Mosi do what he has to do. If you try to stop him, he'll know about you and Bisila. And then you both will end up hanging from a tree, too. If you really love her, stay out of it. Well then! How are you doing? It's not contagious, give me a hug, man. Haven't you heard? Dick and Pao. What, they caught the same thing I did? They were found hanging from a tree. Because of something they did. Because of something you did, too. I drank so much I don't even know how I woke up in my bed. Well, maybe I went too far with the iboga as well... - What happened the other night? - I'm trying to tell you, I can't remember, Kilian. And it's none of your business. Do you even know who she was? What does it matter which one she was? What's the problem, that I left without paying? You raped a woman. You raped her! Osë's daughter, my woman. Jacobo, my woman! I should kill you myself. It'd be much less painful than what Mosi can do to you. Kilian! Kilian! I need to speak to your father. What were you thinking, crossing the forest at night on your own? You're my only friend here, you need to help me. What is this? It's something I need to say. I know everything. I'm sorry. I'm asking you for forgiveness and from your ancestors in the name of my brother and my ancestors. I'm asking for forgiveness from all women who have been humiliated by men such as myself. I promised to never abandon you. And I won't unless you ask me to. I need time, Kilian. We don't have it. Bisila. Tomorrow is Friday. Everybody will be at Santa Isabel at night. This place will be empty. Want to go to Santa Isabel later? Well, well, well, what's with this banger? Stop, pull over there. What's wrong? I don't know anything about engines. Tell Maximiliano to send Waldo; tell him to hurry up, come on. Let's go! Come on. Jacobo, it's me, Kilian. - Kilian! - Calm down. Mosi is here, Kilian. Mosi... Kilian... Kilian. Whose is that? The gun. Gregorio. Get off my island. Hurry up. You're not going to come with me? Go. Hurry up. Kilian, look at me. Go back home. You've still got time to start your life anew. Your hair. I've still got the images in my mind, Kilian. I can't erase them. Mosi didn't have a family. Nobody's going to claim Iniko. I'm going to leave him with my mother and I'll move to a cabin in the outskirts of town. I'll need to be unseen for a while. Then I'll be able to come out and I'll be free to go and do whatever I want to. I need you to promise that you won't try to see me. How long? A year. The time it takes a cocoa tree to bloom. We don't have that much time, you know that as well as I do. Kilian... I've said this once and I say it again. I will always be by your side. Even though you can't see me, I'll be there. A low shot that just sneaks by the post. Coming up next, the president gives his first speech to the people. I declare formally constituted the Republic of Equatorial Guinea of which I become its first constitutional president. - Long live the Republic of Equatorial Guinea! - Long live the Republic! Kilian, any news on Gregorio? No. I thought maybe he'd gone back to Spain without saying anything, but all of his things are still in his bedroom. Including his passport. I don't know anything about him. I don't have the power to protect the Spaniards any more. Be careful, Kilian. Hey, friend! You look tired, why don't you hop in? I prefer walking. Get in. I think that will be enough. You can rest now. That grave should be for your brother. So you're going to pay for him. Why didn't you leave as well? I should return this to you. You white people are nothing without them. Have you all gone crazy? This man is innocent. He didn't respect our laws. That's not true. You know he didn't rape Bisila. She loves him. She is mourning to be able to reunite with him. Jacobo snatched Bisila's "ribalá rèötö". And now you will take his "ribalá rè rihólè"? I'll give you time until Bisila's has finished mourning. Then, you both will have to leave. If not, you know what to expect. Simón, please, fetch me that paper over there. You know what that is? It's an "elëbó". It keeps bad spirits away. Bisila sent it to me when I was away. I'd like to ask you a favour. There's no need for you to do the natives' work. I sleep better if I'm tired. First time I saw you at the cocoa plantations you looked lost, not really knowing what to do. You asked: "What are the songs about?", and I told you... "About work". Work to keep you from thinking. Now I understand. Some of these men spend years without seeing their wives. Now I'm just one more among them. I was just a girl when I arrived here. This is my home. It's the only one I've ever known. If you don't see me cry, it's because Iran out of tears a long time ago. On the other hand... I understand why you don't want to come back, but it's dangerous here. Father Rafael is leaving too. Even Nelson and Oba have realised that this isn't a safe place to live. You're not going to change my mind. I made a promise, Julia. I know, I know... Honestly, I didn't call you to persuade you. I called to ask you a question. Would you change your mind if she would be willing to come with us? Ma'am. They are here. Wait a minute. Iniko! He's precious. Hello, Bisila. How are you? His name is Fernando Laha. May I? It'll be our secret. His future siblings won't notice the difference. I won't be able to have more children. Two is enough. If you want, nothing can stop us from being a family. I want that. Wait a moment. Sorry. Sorry. Excuse me. Bisila. Julia! Kilian. I'll see you in a minute. Thank you very much. What's the matter? You are Guinean, you cannot leave. This woman is my wife. - Show me the papers. - Father! The papers. I'm Father Rafael, the priest of St. Isabel. Their papers were lost in a fire during the riots. I married them, she's as Spanish as we are. Children of a Spaniard and a Guinean are Guinean, not Spanish. They cannot travel. This woman is Spanish, not Guinean. She's free to go aboard, but this child is Guinean, and so is the mulatto. They don't leave. You decide whether you leave or you stay. You'd better get on the ship. When we get to Spain, we'll fix it at the embassy. They're my family, I'm not leaving without them. Then clear the way! Get out of here! Get out! You, pass. Go, come on! Get up, get up. Are you OK? Bisila, are you OK? Don't move! Get back! - Close the doors. - Let's go! - Come on, let's go! - Close! Get back! Get back! Come on! Come on! Go, go, go, go! Kilian! Kilian! Kilian! - Kilian! - Sit down! Oba! Kilian! Nelson... Help! Please! Nelson! Let's go. Kilian! Kilian! Sooner or later, they'll come back for us. They won't allow us to live together. Maybe they won't let us live together... But they won't be able to separate us, either. Can I now? No, not yet. Now you can. Your turn, undress yourself. We have two kinds of marriage. "Ribalá rèötö", the kind that buys virginity. It's the one that bonded me to Mosi. But we also have "ribalá rè rihólè". Marriage based on love. It's not valid before the law. But it is between us. We don't have a priestess, but the keeper of island can be our witness. If that's what you want. It's what I want. Then I must talk first. I promise that I will always be faithful to you in my heart. What should I say? You need to say that you won't abandon this wife. Despite the many others that you may have. I won't leave you, no matter what. In my heart, at least. All around us, the world was falling apart... But in Bisappoo, we could finally live our love freely. And that was the only thing that mattered. We didn't know how long happiness could last. It wasn't long. Bisappoo would burn soon. All the Spaniards had to leave the island... due to Macías' decree and not be able to return. Nevertheless, those were the happiest days of my life. Enough to give meaning to an entire lifetime. Bisila... She gave me another present for you, Uncle Kilian. I hope I can do it right. I learnt it just like she taught me.
