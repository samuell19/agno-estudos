Your tooth is cracked. The pain will go if the burn it. - How are you going to burn it? - Our Barber Elim. He knows what to do. First you have to heat up a piece of wire until it gets red. Then we'll stick it into the crack and burn your tooth. - Can you stand the pain? - I don't know. Is it possible? - Are you ready? -Yes I am. Don't you shut your mouth or shake your head to le ft or right. Hold him tight. Don't let him move. Hold him tight. We'll marry as soon as I get released. As the head of the family... ...my word counts. You'll have to accept everything I say. If I say it's black, you'll know it is black. You won't talk to men or joke with them. I'll get mad. You won't talk with other men except for you brothers and closed relatives. You'll do what I say. You won't go against my word. No talk of like let me put on these and that. I'll get angry, very angry. I will determine what you will do and put on. Got it? Alright. How nice you've put it. Did you learn all these, in jail? Who knows when we'll meet again. Write me letters. Long. Long letters. Send them to your new house's address. Don't send them to us... ...or my dad gets mad. - He's an old fashioned man. What age do we live in? I just don't get it. Who's Meral, ha? Who? She's my fianc?. I mean, she's going to be my wife. Is there anything worse than this? This is our custom. Don't you know how people gossip? Who cares about them? Do I interfere in their business? - Don't drink, you'll get drunk. - What's it to you? Call those two detectives too. Let them also interfere in my raki. Two detectives, to watchman, moving right behind us. Why? Just in case something happens? What could have happened, I'm asking you? Damn you, your two detectives too. Come in. Come in. Don't look. Come. Isn't that ours? Come baby. - What's today? - Friday. Come in! - Go to number 4. - Number 4! I won't go to number 4. - What's your number? - Are you crazy or what? He's obsessed with numbers. Piss off. Anything but number 4. - I'm waiting at number 11 . - 11 is okay. Don't be late. Don't come late, come early. Don't come late, come early. I'm just wondering, why did you not go to number 4? 4 is the number of my dorm at jail. You know what? I don't like neither the dorm, nor the detectives. Got it? No I didn't. I didn't enjoy this leave at all. How could you flee? - What happened dad? - Emine has run away. Cinde. - Father, Seyit is here. - Let me kiss your hand. How did you get here in this snow and weather? - It was pretty hard. - How are your parents? Fine. They've sent their regards. - Did you talk to Sevket? - I did. What do you think? The same. Tell me... when? I'd like to take away my wife and son tonight if you please. - Where? -To Sancak. To Sevket's place. You have something on your mind? I have. Did she see you? She did. 8 month... She's tied up there like a dog. Her leg is chained up. She didn't see day light for 8 month. It's forbidden. She's forbidden anything but bread and water. No water touched her skin since 8 month. That's what she deserves. Are you happy to see me? She wants to arouse pity for herself. Seyit Ali, don't you grow soft on her. Don't let your hands shake. She's blackened the name of our family. Don't you pity her. I'm going to take you to your uncle. We'll take your mom too. - We shouldn't take her? - Why? She's Filthy. Your uncle said ''Take Zine and my nephew. '' he said. - Are you going to talk to Zine? - I will. Well. Talk. But be aware. She's devil. Don't be taken in by her. Be brave. Use your hatred and anger. I'm ashamed of you Seyit. I told you I would wait but couldn't. What shall I say? What's done is done. What shall I say? I became thinner and thinner. What could I do? What good would it do if I'd say I'm sorry? What should I weep for, why should I complain? What's gone is gone. I've deserved it all. I'm in this barn for 8 month. Don't resemble a human anymore. I just have bread and water. But you behaved to me like a human. You know what I think. I have no more bread to eat, water to drink... ...in this world. They were waiting for you, and here you are. Don't kill me like this. Let me take a bath, put clean clothes on, comb my hair... ...purify my self and do my prayer. What else? - I'd like to embrace my son. - What son? You know. I came here to take you to Sancak to your big brother Sevket. I'm not going to shoot you. May God punish you. Whatever you say. I know how I'll end up. I ask from you not to hand me over to somebody else. Give me what I deserve. We've shared the same bed. My Seyit. We have a right on each other. A marital right. Please don't deny me my last wish. I'm not the Seyit Ali you used to know. I'm not the old Seyit Ali. I used to proud and honorable. But now... I don't have the nerve to go out in public anymore. I'm burning inside. I asked you. You said you could wait. Is this how you were supposed to wait? But I swore not to harm you. God will punish you. Open the door! What the hell?! Goodness gracious. Things have gone dogs. You rotten shits. Excuse me. Get out of the way! Mommy, Daddy! God damn you. You infidels. Beat them up! Mommy! Daddy! Beat them! Some things are hard to tell. They're hard to tell and to understand. So what? Are you going to understand it and we're not? That's not what I meant? What do you mean then? You've been busted in the look. Isn't this shameful? It's a shame for you. For me it's necessity. Cut it short. What necessity? Do you have any marriage papers? We're not officially married. But we have kids. How shall I know if the kids are someone else'. Let's hand them over to the security forces at the first station... ...with our report. There are rules and regulations in this country. Let them be punished. - Are the kids really yours? -They are. You should be ashamed of your children. Take the kids inside. Come. How are you going to go out in public now? God damn you all. You wretch! You should thank your children. Otherwise I wouldn't let you go. Don't you go out. They will tear you to pieces. Stay where you are. You better talk to the people at the door. Okay people. Return to your places. It's just a hastily couple. Immorals! You evil! You should have dressed down. Alright. Evil, immoral, this and that. Break it up! It's their own trouble. Break it up! Seyit said ''I will take you to Sevket. '' That's what he said to us too. ''Let Zine have a bath... ...give her clean cloth and a comb for her hair. We'll set off when the moon rises. So he had pity on me. He thought it over and... ...pitied on me. I'm afraid. I'm afraid. I accustomed my self to death. But Seyit said such things, I don't know how to put it. A hope grew inside me. I wasn't Afraid of death in the past. I wanted it. But now... now I'm scared. Sefer. Don't shoot. Seyit, wake up! The moon has risen. Be brave my son. If you get soft on her and your hands shake... ...I will hound you even in the next world. Don't forget, these two hands won't leave you in peace. Remove this stain from our faces. Clean our honor. Farewell sister. Maybe we won't see each other again. - You have so much right on me. - Nobody has. May God forgive you. I kept this for bad day s. I don't need this anymore. -Take it. - I won't. Why? That gold has the thing of your flesh and bone? What thing? You sold your flesh for that gold. - Forgive your rights on me. - What's there to forgive? May you have a good journey. Zine is weak and ill. She can't endure this journey in winter. Does she have the strength for the way? She's ill, her clothes are thin. She'll freeze and cause them trouble. Let her freeze and die. You can't cross the Cobantasi Pass like this. - If you go like this, you'll freeze. - I'll freeze? You'll freeze. The pass is pretty windy. It will freeze a man instantly. Saliho's bride froze two day s ago. And two of her kids. You have a long way ahead. At least Five hours. Oh my God. Give me strength. Don't leave me here. Give me strength. That's the Syrian border. The border is stuffed up with barb wires, mines. Those mines have blew apart my fathers and hundreds of villagers... ...limbs and heads. The borders which are the grave of hundreds of villagers. The Syrian territory is just But you can't go. Because you can't explain your situation. Nobody wants to understand you. They say go, finish your sentence. Abuzer is a fugitive, you're a fugitive. They say, what are we going to do. I wish I knew. I can't accept it anymore. I'm fed up being depressed. They want to wed you. They say you'd be docile when you get married. But they got no money. I won't marry. I don't want to leave a widow behind me. Halil, I saw a girl when I came here. I know her but I'm not sure. Her nose... That's M?sl?m's daughter. Her name is G?lbahar. She's a strong girl. She was a kid when you were put in jail. - What's that father? - A horse carcass. I'm worn out. Oh God, give me strength. Seyit! Seyit! Don't leave me here. Seyit! Daddy! What? - My mom lags behind. - She'll catch up. But she can't. She's shouting. Seyit! Save me! You wished she wouldn't have come with us. You brought her. Then you shouldn't have. I don't feel my legs! I can't walk. My legs don't move! Saliho's bride froze in two hours distance. They sweat. They got excited and sweat. Then they were exposed to the cold, got stuck in the snow and fell asleep. My legs... My legs... They don't carry me anymore. I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Forgive me. I can't look you in the face. Forgive me. Forgive me. Don't let the beasts feed on me here. I'm willing to be your slave. My hands... My hands... I don't feel my hands. My hands! My hands! I'm dying Seyit. I'm dying. Forgive me. Forgive me. I'm ashamed of you. Forgive your rights on me. You were a very good man. You used to play the pipe so nice. I wept when you played. Zine! Zine! Wake up! Wake up! Don't fall asleep Zine. If you sleep, you'll freeze. Don't sleep. Zine! Wake up. Zine wake up. Don't fall asleep. Zine wake up. Don't sleep. Zine. Get up Zine. Get up. Zine, don't sleep. Don't sleep. Zine don't sleep! Get up! Mirza. Hit your mom so she won't sleep. Hit her! Hit her! What's up? Are you Sevket? - Your sister? - My sister. She froze to death. My condolences. - My father? - Heaven forbid! I hope it's not him. My father? My father? God knows. We can't know. I hope it's not him. Friends, this country is our country. We have no differences. Yesterday night there was a clash at the border. You must have heard the shots. Yet we were not able to find any papers for identification. Look at the dead, whether you know them or not. We're going to give the corpses to their relatives. Look and tell us if you know them. The corpses are in the truck. Look at them. We're sorry too. But law is law. That's what happens to those who break the laws. Cooperate. Look at the corpses and tell us whether you know them. You'll be punished if you know them and don't tell us. Do you know them? No. I don't know any one. - Is there anyone you know? - No. - Is there anyone you know? - No. Get out. My condolences. You know, I'm your husband know. That's the code. Seyit! Don't let the beasts feed on me. Save me! Seyit! After all those years there's Diyarbakir. My poor children, my wife. Those who love me despite everything. The ones who'll feel happy to see me. My father-in-law, mother-in-law and brothers-in-law. My father-in-law, mother-in-law and brothers-in-law. Those who hate me. That's weird. This is Diyarbakir.
