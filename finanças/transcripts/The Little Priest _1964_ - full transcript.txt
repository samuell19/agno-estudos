What's up Damien? What does Uncle have? A letter from the bishopric. They notify me that given my advanced age ... They're going to send me a priest to be ... my co-tutor and medium in the parish ministries. Old. Saint Alphonsus Maria reached the age of 91 years ... without ceasing to exercise his apostolate. Resign yourself brother. The man propose and God dispose. God is fair. You cannot order an injustice. Well man, but probably or they will make you rest a little. I have never rest. I never miss Monday. This is the only saint who is not of my devotion. Very good, but there is never a little help. I do not need help. The Lord's is enough for me. Right now I am going to write to this prelate saying that I cannot be old. But not tempted to the devil. You have always said that the first obligation of a good priest is obedience. If your superiors ordered you must obey. Yes Sara, well done! I think I owe an apology. I'm going to the parish for a moment. Poor thing, it's too hard for him. He has no choice but to obey. But I am neither a cure nor a colon healer . What are you thinking mom? I think it is better to let this new band-aid arrive. And make life impossible to force him to leave. Mother. But that is not being a good Christian. But yes, a good sister. Forgive my bad thoughts and my outbursts. Send me you want thousands of priests, to help me, but do not remove me from my parish. I know I'm too old to be in front of her. But leave me here until you want me to stiffen. It is almost forty years of being in this church serving you. I wouldn't know how to be anywhere else, Lord. In another place it may be necessary, not here. I will not allow a new priest to meddle in the affairs of the people. With one we already have enough. You run all over the place that nobody is going to receive that band-aid when they arrive tomorrow. - It is understood. - It's okay, boss. And you, son, would like for others that when this Band-Aid arrives you will receive him at the truck terminal. And make him see that here he will not be well received. And let him go where he came from. Hey Dad, why do you think this Band-Aid will be so picky? What a stupid boy. For all priests they are the same. They love to get into the lives of evil. And it is not in my interest for anyone to get into my life and my business. That they are not very Catholic, let's say. Father Damián is very old and it is not dangerous. Because he thinks I'm on his side. This new band-aid, who knows. I assure you that a great reception with rockets and the whole thing awaits me . I don't know if I am so interested in my personal courses. But I don't love it like whoever says it, I relax. And I bet everyone notable in town will be waiting for me. Bet me Well, more than that, because priests are not allowed to bet. But you will see it is natural. Whenever a new priest arrives, there are celebrations, there is movement. As the saying goes, heal new, new life. Why so happy Father? Does a little like to change parish? Well, here between us, I will tell you one thing. This is my first parish. Since he wanted to serve God and leave the seminary. Well these are the first steps. I am fresh from the shell, like who says I am a priest, support it. But it is on the right track. At the most, as you say , my kidneys already hurt ... From so much jumping. Didn't I tell you that there are already rockets? I will be all this. I had never seen rockets on horseback. Hey, there's nobody here. Why haven't you received notice of your arrival, Father? Hey, the population is few or who knows it's quarantined. Either way this is sadder than winter. Thanks guys for coming to meet me I was already surprised that ... Look, little father. Better than retache where it came from. Because this town is quite sanctified with a priest. Well, notice that with two priests you would be doubly sanctified. So better, I stay. It is a tip. And why do I want a son rabbit? A tip I said. Advice. With all my pleasure, I'm supposed to come here to give them, right? I want to do well. Don't look for trouble. Note that it is funny, but it is precisely what I am looking for, difficulties. I do not understand you. Because easy things don't need help from anyone. Saint Peter said, so the difficult becomes easy. And how easy seems difficult. Because of how difficult I like to be soon. And the impossible always takes me a little bit longer. To you and him. But don't look for him, because fear doesn't ride the donkey. No, because here I already saw that he is riding a horse. Sorry father. When did Saint Peter say that? Never son, I just made up to show it Because he thinks he will leave me. -Who is this guy? -He is the son of Don Silvestre. Ah yes, Don Silvestre. And who is Don Silvestre? I think it won't take him long to know. Good luck father. That he is going to miss it! Anyway you don't go very far ... If we have to go back. I told you not to leave ... Did you read the letter you brought me? Hey, who are you taking me for? I am unable to violate correspondence. Also, the leftover is too thick ... For much struggle to read that nothing is translated! Here he tells me that his superior at the seminary ... That you are quite nervous and have a very weak memory. But how can I expect to eat well here because he already looked at me getting fat, right? He also says that you are very responsive. Well, thank you very much for finding so many qualities, and I miss you because I am not answered. What happens is that I am very left there are cases, for example. Look at you, let's go sleep, let's go sleep ... If a person in good faith comes, because very well one is not obliged ... Because also sincerely a similar no? But there are also times when Father thinks well, then. Is this the crucial moment of the individual? So not to leave one up the best one falls. For under the logo as it goes up. Not these things father, because certainly an individual, I understand ... ... It is better to be at an observational point like it says neither too high nor too low. But if you can coexist and this unanimous coexistence with people, let us say. Very well man, well, pray, if also ... That one consolidates, this good, as someone says, is loaded with love, loaded with love. And man, because there is so little that abuse, There is one thing that he does not say in the letter, but that I am going to tell him. I don't understand a single word. Well that is very strange, as who says it is a matter of recruitment. Hear that I will confess that I do not understand either. But I synced what I say. There is something else the letter says! That you are very apt to make personal comments on ecclesiastical matters. Well, yes, little Father, so I deny them, right. It encourages me to do things out of conviction. Not because the sixth tells me the others as the saint Felipe Torres Montes says. Oh, to analyze the matter and if it suits me, well I'm done. Because if it doesn't suit me ... I am indisposed. How does Father see it? Is he a mustache? No Father, rather a sketch. Because it's from my family! We have everything at home. My mother was called "the horn". Why don't you shave? Well yes, Father, you hold on tighter because it is like pruning, look well as well as moss, no. If to live with us. My sister will lead you to her room. The house is small, but it is her house. And won't it be frowned upon that a Father has a small house? How do you say I said that the best presence bothers you that you are not very happy that I would have come. To Saint Jerome Chico, right father Danube? Look at you, first of all this is not San Jerónimo Chico ... It is Saint Jerome Alto ... Well, it has grown! Yes sir! Secondly, I will thank you for calling me Father Damián, that is my name. Thirdly, my sincerity obliges me to inform you that I consider your coming to this parish absolutely unnecessary! Now, Father, speaking clearly , people understand each other and become friends! Yes sir, and it's getting a little late, don't you think it's better to retire. Tomorrow I will teach you the parish operation. Yes father, until tomorrow. See you tomorrow! Father, do you know a certain Don Silvestre? - Of course I know him! - Who? He is a man with a heart of gold. Despite its abrupt and violent nature. He is an atheist. God help me get that derailed sheep back to my flock. What are you also a rancher? No sir, I am a pastor of souls! I am concerned about my disbelief! It is good on the farm. He gave the organ to the parish. Did he give the organ away? Completito. And it is also made infinite works of charity. It's good. I promised myself a lot to Build the dispensary. What a barbarian! Why are you talking about Silvestre? Do you know something about him? Not for nothing, just explained to me what the driver had said. Why was I here before I asked him. Well, see you Father this morning. - Good evening, father! - Good night, daughter! I'm glad you came. Because it is the first to rejoice. I hope it is very useful to my uncle. Of course, why I do not expect to be like the sword of Santa Catarina. That no longer shines but does not cut. And I thank you for all your phrases in all that is worth. It is worth very little. So much the better, because I have to pay somehow. And here in between I confess that I was already needing to see a friendly face in this town. Everyone has treated me as if they knew I was sick of it. Except Señor Cura, who must be sick with the gallbladder. It is that they have a great affection for my uncle. And they contradict him because they think that he came to remove his post. But there is a right. I do not come to take anything from anyone. I am a priest, I am not a banker. Have you already had dinner? Well the truth, not yet. Well we do. So hold on until breakfast tomorrow. Show him his room. - Goodnight! - Good evening, father! Sebastián, to serve God and you. And since it beats me that we are going to be very good friends. You can call me Father "Sebas" Come on Father "Sebas". For you Don Sebastián I would like, a little. Oh, how smooth. I, as a kid, loved to slide down the railing, didn't you? We never had a railing at home. It makes me never was a kid. There had to be a candle around here. This room has no light. We always use it for useless rails. Ah, here it is. And do they get bats, and don't make them present here? Yes, there is, but it is not season. But you have to be careful with tarantulas. Do not worry, I will take care of you as the family. E try not to walk barefoot. That chao is very cold? No, for the scorpions. Ah Father. I will be careful not to crush them. I guess I also make roaches, right? Yes. Those little blondes What a pity, I would like them to fuse so tight and fat that they look like cassock train. Yes, a little hard. It does not matter how I say. They are stone interference. The stone bed. The burial. Please do not keep the candle burning too long, because it is spent. Oh yeah. Home Sweet Home. "Polvicete polvetis return." Good Morning! It should now be soaped. Don't be bad, mom. Bad? Why? The sabotage began, the choro is over. Is Father Damien here? He is not son, what happened? You know, I come to confess, but if it isn't, I'll be back tomorrow. No, why tomorrow? The confession of the sinner that is needed and the priest. We are both. Why do you wait It is what I am used to Damián Padre. You already know me. How do you say, you already know his tricks. Well, do not be afraid here between us these things ... I don't think I have very great sins. A parent is important, of course. Get out of here past you with what that guy. Here among us, have you attended a Christian? - No father. Have you taken away their envidos come out? - No, I'm not a thief. Have you got into politics? - No Father. I see that your sins are not so serious. So what kind of sins do you have? You know Father, I have to do with two women. - With two? - No, three. Why do I go out with the little sister of the postmaster and the niece of a druggist. And I am also committed to the daughter of the Municipal President. And that's it? The most I'm married and ... - Okay, son. That it seems to me that you do not come to confess that you boast me. You better come tomorrow. Because for these things I am very tender and you will not pervert me. Take Father Damien. God be with you. Ah, barbarian! What are you doing here? Why do you ask if you already saw me. He was nailing the candles. And I know can I know why he sticks the candles in you? When are you selling that there is no Madeira here that holds the key? For sell them And who is this sacrificial renegade buying stolen stuff? Damien father. Damien father? He does not know that they are his. And since I give them to you cheaper than the store. Tell me, why are you stealing? Is that what they teach at school? I don't even go to school. Has the rock already appeared? That yes I do not steal it. Tell me son, why don't you go to school? Well, because there is no People there is none. Once a teacher came but Don Silvestre ran him. Well, even though that guy from Don Silvestre says so. It is preparing you that very soon we will have a school in Pueblo. Now go to your house and you will communicate. I don't like to confess. Well, if you don't like it, don't confess. So it is not a sin? Well, look, you still don't know what sin is. You do these things, because you have nothing to entertain with. I would not call it sin. More mischief. And God is so good that He loves all the children, and also the naughty ones. Pull, go home. Did you send for Dad? Yes, you know that nothing can happen in this town without my finding out. They will already inform me that he is making the wedding to the Lord Cura's niece, Don Damián. That I will not allow Marcos. No, sir, dad. You don't have to worry. Look, Suzana is the only town girl I didn't date. And the canteen I bet with the boys who would conquer it and that it would not be very difficult no matter how niece the priest is. No? This is my son! As macho as his father! Well I'm calm because I look scared. Imagine me related to a priest. On the subject of cures, I am preparing a little Father that. Who will never forget San Jerónimo del Alto. - What do you think dad? - Well, look ... You forgive boss. That after? Well, there's someone out here who wants to see you. Why does he say that with that face? Who the hell is he? This! It is not the devil precisely because if not it would begin to smell sulfur. I am the new parish curate of the parish. Man, speaking of the king of Rome ... Please do me. Because I am not a king, if not the son of a peasant. And I, who was not born in Rome, was born in Chorula. Which is not that big, but we make sweet potatoes thicker than spaghetti. Come in, come in. This is my son Marcos. Yes, I already dyed the taste of knowing it when I was throwing. Throwing, throwing what? Well, first you shot, logo threw bravado and then he wanted to kick me out of town. Look, if this doesn't have a good mood. What did you think that priests are sad? I don't know how their God was crucified. Yes, but notice that he has already risen and we are very happy. Well, what am I good for? At first glance, not at all. Christianly speaking. But more come I have come here to see if Poe you to create a school in the Town. Well, because first of all education only brings discontent. It makes men unhappy because they always end up craving or that they don't have. And in this town, that's why we are all happy. Why are you satisfied with what God gives you! Yes, the peasant does not need to know how to read and write. Simply plowing and cultivating their land is enough. - Her land? - Yes, your land! I say your land from you. Because here is what the land belongs to who works it is a story, right Don Florido? - Silvestre! It is the same, they are all herbs. So, secondly, you peasants should not know how to read or write. So that they realize their rights. Nor that the time that settled you had slaves is over. Do you realize son, because I did not want this Band-Aid to stay in the Town? I like living people. Me too, because the dead are very serious. Notice that we can agree. It can go well for both of us. That is going very well for me, thank God. But it could do better. What do you think I could get to the bishop? Don't do it, you know where I'm going. But you don't know where I'm coming from. How much would your collaboration be? Is he proposing to me, like who says, a bite? With silver people are understood. Would a miracle suffice? Well take it off you a thousand pesos is How to remove a hair from an ox. Not offending the present. Look Don Gladiolo, what happens is that you brought the sleeping father Damien. You bring it shielded, but here I am to do the remove. If you want to give your money I will be happy to accept it. But not here, but in the Church And to dedicate it to works of charity. And as one who warns is not a traitor, and On warning there is no deception. I inform you that this Town will have its little girl very soon. And if you want to attend classes, you have no problem. And I will notify Father Danube. A horn. And who will this Father Danube be? A little apart from us they want to tie another. - Good afternoon father! - Good afternoon, son! What is on offer? We want to bathe chi paiate parasiton. Very well, I am going by my roquete e my stole And already returned. It is that we would like the holy water to be poured by Father Damien. Well, it can't. Because Father Damiano is as well as I am. And this child, or I soak OR remains anonymous. Let's see what nickname he puts? That decides? In this case what your mercé says. Well I don't know what your mercé says. I say is that who is going to appeal to continue ajemujando. How are you going to put the interfect? Well, as I call myself, Nepomuceno. How do you say he said? Nepomucene. Oh, yes, no. This little name I do not put this child. Even though he is going to be the first Christian that I am going to wow. But that's what my name is. And you are not ashamed? Nepomucene. Poor little creature. That lies with Father Damián. That grabs everything. I want to have a very clear conscience. - Nepomucene. This is for Father Sebastián. What did mom put on them? Nothing daughter, but this is for him. How does a priest refuse to baptize a child? Father Danubio would have refused an altistic Reason. Damien father that is my name. That is so that a sacrament is never denied. Well, God forgive me. But a boy with this name. I do not baptize, not in the name of the father In the name of the son and holy spirit. Nepomucene. Innocent little creature. Why do things second Your own opinion? First of all because I have it Father. And secondly, because I consider that it is necessary to be sincere and loyal to oneself in order to become a good priest. Because you will need a lot of consistency. Because you are very stubborn and very slow to learn things. No, sir, because I have asterason. Because I agree as a child until I was fifteen and with a lot of work. I learned to say mom and dad. And it surely took a lot of work for him to leave the pacifier. Look no, I still suck. And how did you decide to become a priest? Well, to follow a call from God, Father. Are you sure you didn't get confused by voice? Not sure Father. Although I tell you one thing, that as a kid I was very fat. He was a wallet, a wastepaper basket, a bolero. Car cleaner, leader, it was up to bullfighter notice. I don't think that in this profession you have come very far. Well you were wrong, because I got to the first row of the ventud barrier that I saw the bull. Good because this race was not followed? So much so that I stopped at my house. It was when mom told me. Look doll, you don't have flamenco blood, and you don't feel like a bullfighter ... Well, why is he a clown? e is right cut my ponytail. And then I left gypsy for life from here to here, from here to here ... Well, stirring, until one day accidentally, look, I read the life of Saint Thomas Aquinas. And it says Here-no, Here yes! And here you have me. Serving the Lord and trying to serve my fellow men. That you can't, There is something to do Always in a challenging way. And people feel the love and warmth that one can give. And little, but enough. Very commendable. But you cannot go out into the street looking for someone to do good. No, because I was saying I can't sit in the confessional either, waiting for one to come and tell about their problems. That later troublesotas. And they don't solve anything. What you need to go out to find your problems, and try to solve them. In other words, think like a missionary. Have you never heard of or who says "You do good and don't look at whom?" Well that's my motto. do who and don't look at me well because you look closely, because you don't even know who. let me think about it because it gives me again I have not understood a word. I forgot, from tomorrow I will beg you to go up to the bell tower. To ring the bells. I can't do everything. Yes, of course, you cannot ring and walk in the procession. The first call is six. -In the morning? -Sure! Well you are my toothpicks. I would say Father, a suggestion will be possible, right? What to change our itinerary. That instead of giving six o'clock masses, we could give rooster mass at twelve o'clock at night. Which is when bad intentions begin . Better not follow. I'm very tired, I'm going to sleep. Please, Sara, take my glass to my room. -Good night, Suzana !. -Goodnight uncle! Good evening, Father Sebastián. Good evening, Father Damien, And may you dream of the little angels. You have to win. No, I know what happens, everything goes wrong, man. No one about my brilliant ideas. As one said, because in a way the best that I do not even serve to be a sacristan. For something I did not know , everyone knows me. I already think it works. Look, put a candle to Santa Rita, the impossible lawyer. Well, a lawyer does not help me, she takes a better shelter from me. What you have to do is make yourself understood, insist. Okay As Napoleon says, we will insist. - Is Dona Sarah Cognac? - Cognac. They say that a glass of this after each meal tones the soul and fortifies the spirit. And besides, I'm going to sleep, right? - Yes, very true, yes! But this is exclusively for my brother. As it is very old to see we strengthen it a little. You are young and you don't need it. Of course, Dona Sara, one day I will also be , it is very vitaminic. Now that I remember what do you know about tiles? "Lands", since they are on the border of the other side that is ours. And that Pancho Villa crossed very follow. What are you talking about? Well, land. I mean roof tiles. Ah, I know you had said. The tiles are pieces made of clay in the form of tiles. It is used to put on the roofs so that the water does not pass. Well I'm glad you knew. Because the roof of the parish must be fixed every year. Who does it is my brother. But as they say the poor thing is this old tao. And you will be sent to help you. I don't know anything as a bricklayer Courage, as the Lord says the words. What is free from sin that throws the first "tile". The first "tile". it was not "tile". But in any case, it was a disaster. I still don't think he should talk to his mom and your uncle. I will first tell my father. I have not found the opportunity. We will wait Marcos. I also don't know how it will take my family. Now you better go, it's late. Until tomorrow, I will go see my life! - Until tomorrow, Marcos. - See you tomorrow! Come on, peck it. Don't let him sleep. stick it sunny with me, melting the light, cutting off water ... and teasing the bad food I give him. You have a pump-proof stomach. It digests everything. Everything does not donate Sara. The pier from another night I really disliked. Clear as a bat chela. As a bat, rightly I felt something that made my stomach flutter. Look at Doña Sara since I got here. I feel unwell. Why is it brought? Well, look at Father Sebastián. You have broken into my brother's land. And to defend it. I am ready to declare war. But I am a priest, I am not a General. I would have preferred that you did not find out, but my way. He grabbed me red-handed. In chickens. Well, it is already warned that we are in the middle of the cold war. Yes, I had already noticed since the other night ... that you served me the soup that looked like lemon snow. What route hostilities ... And that you can finish with your patience I will be size size size. And I receive, receive no. Well, God forgive me. Well let's see how dona saraguata plays He is going to retaliate, do not forget that he is a priest. And you never heard of the Holy War? From the crusades? Well, you have crossed my path. And now, bloody chipote I don't answer if it's small or big. Good morning, Father Sebas. Good morning, Suzanita, how did your soul wake up? He slept well? Yes thanks. Was not a little revealed? Because what you say? No, for nothing that last night I opened the window to let me get some fresh air. And I saw her talking with Don Silvestre's son a lot. Please don't say anything. Is that because Suzanita? Because nobody knows that we love each other. And there are spark problems. Marcos has a bad reputation. They say he is a woman, a rancher, a player. any scratching. But none of that is true. What happens that they are envious for being rich. And because all the girls in town are after him. But, Marcos is not home. Overall, they are all stickers, but without Marcos. He only wants me. Sure, he already preferred you. Not a fool boy. And say one thing, Suzanita. You or want, right? Yes. You won't report me, will you? Hey, because you've taken me for a snitch. No Suzanita but I change my silence I am going to ask you for a favor. A favor, like who says, a cambalache. Your uncle has told me that you studied in Guadalajara. And he has very good instruction. Would you like to take care of a little school I'm training? - Teacher? - Well, so I parvo him? Haunted. Nothing more than we will need blackboards, pencils, notebooks. Yes, blackboards and everything I do to you don't worry. I take care of everything. Hey Father Sebas. Charros, to die on the coast. - That this Doña Sara? -Stew. Of bat? No, beef. We already started with direct. not only did I heat it up a lot so it gives you time to get to ring the bells. Thank you very much Doña Sara. What's wrong, Father Sebastian? Why cry? because my religion forbids me to hate my fellow men, Doña Sara. Well, I'm sorry, father, but it wo n't take long for it to cool down. It is already six o'clock. And you have to go up to the bell tower to call the first mass. By no means, ay fasting May God help. You don't know about sayings. It is who gets up early, God helps him. Doña Sara is right. I don't know much about sayings. But calming mountains singing birds alicantes pintos and muleteers we are and on the way we walk. And ay reata do not burst that it is the last milestone. And now is when the green chili you have to flavor the broth. And open your ears wide to hear the bells. And there are people who do not bathe, just lick their faces, as Doña Sara saw her. And open it, I'm hurt, but I'm not going to splash. You shouldn't be mad mom. Father Sebastián is a good person. And it's a great help to uncle. I have no doubt that Little Father are good people. But that help is not true. It has not been sent is not for collaboration. But for everyone to learn what he has to learn. And then leave him in front of the parish. You know this would represent my brother's death. What are you going Jálese. Oh, I just saw someone just like you. I was the father. What I entered through the canteen. I have two businesses you know while I attend here and while I attend the other. Man, what a good thing he would have said because Sunday at Mass I will pass the alms tray twice. But the father. Well, I'm going to need a blackboard, chalk, notebooks and lots of pencils. Father right away. There is just going to be a little problem. That I have no money to pay. Sorry father, because here you don't trust. Very well done, we in the Church also do not trust. Let's see, Father. Well I do not pretend that you trust me the merchandise son. What do you think if we play it? But do you play? Why not? Saint Ignatius of Loyola bet thirty days of ascent. Now yes, father, I put merchandise, and you who give me change? Well, the indulgences and blessings, is that not enough? Damien father always gives me free. Why Father Damien is so wasted. Look, let's do one thing. If you win you do not give alms to the church for a year. Make it a year and a half. To see what I want as dealers, let it be one year and three months, what do you say? Done. And what do we play? to the tree. No, something more decent, alcobilete. Sir, it's for a good deed. Give me a little hand. - The best game in one run, okay? - Play. Your first child. Four kings. One moment. Sopledito. Sopledote. - Aces, are you okay? - But here are six aces. - Miracle. What about miracles you don't have to ask questions. Send me my things. It gives me great pleasure that they have come to school to study and learn. Why say that tomorrow they will be men of profit. And not some donkeys. Because in every town house there is always a donkey and an old man. The important thing is not that the old man is not such a donkey ... and the donkey is not that old. Children would understand me. Here is our teacher will take care of teaching them. I am going to give you catechism classes. To prepare little by little for your first communion. Now we are going to see if who knows the decorated Our Father . Decorrido to say, followed. Do not think that here I sing no ranchero style. Father Sebastian, I would like to speak with you for a minute. The town sources have come to tell me several things. Like the tupe in gossip. How is it possible for a priest to walk the streets ... robbing Balero. But this is not a sin, Father. - But you already in cassock. - Well, no way with mengana. A bishop dancing in the bell tower. And what's wrong with that? That you have never heard of "San Pascual Bailón"? Bailón, bailón, arrived at Santo. I've also been told that you saw him playing dice with the camper. Well, that's true because I deny it. Don't you know that a priest should not gamble or gamble? I do not know realize that it is a terrible vice? Well, I have a schizophrenic Father, I understand, but it has a natal origin. You inherited it from your family. No, my family inherited it from me. But you don't have the will power. I have willpower, is that the people are very sticky. as well as it attracts one itches. You have noticed that the children were marbles and itched. This is precisely what we should avoid. Children must be taught that man's enemies are the world, devil and flesh. Oh but what meat Father? If the poor people barely know the choche quesadillas. Oh, I would also like to thank you for facilitating the favor of facilitating the patio to give the classes. I hope that his teachings do not form a group of youth gang members. Oh Father, don't be sent. I hope by God it is not like that. Oh, Father Sebastian, do me a favor. Yes father. The sacristy has a couple who come to set a date to marry and ask for the warnings, attend. That I'm going to see Don Silvestre, who has sent me an urgent call. You can go calmly without being upset. Are you the ones who want to get married? Yes father. And will they think well? Isn't it turning out that you want your home apart? Our marriage is for love, Father. It's fine until the kids come, things change. Either way, a marriage is a very momentous step. That you have to think about it, you do n't have to do things quickly. Many times the bride and groom are very green. And the thing does not work. And other times they are very mature and it does not work , because they will not roast. Man has to be a worker To sustain the place. And you have a lazy face, and you can't handle it. And the woman must be very mistress of her house. What are you doing that you don't know how to cook? Yes father. Let's see how you make a "chilaquiles" Tortillas are cut, fried and sauce is added ... and when it is dry the cheese is put. And what happened to the garlic, the onion and the pasote? You already saw how you don't know. So you don't know how to make a "chilaquiles" And you are a lazy I said the father. I work from sunrise to sunset. What happened to the cloudy young days? No children, you are still not good for marriage. They are very cute, no sir, keep dating until you know how to cook. That he knows how to make chilaquiles, peneques, the chiles in the huaca that are very tasty. And you until you learn to work even when it's cloudy. But little Father, we just came to see the warnings. I've already bothered you. Do you want more? Let's see zonza. Ah what boys. Chilaquiles were already burning. Forgive me for being late I was killing the views. I can't see my room. Notice that I met Don Vincenzo Guerrero on the street , he was very drunk. He started me with his wife, I can't imagine how I ran. And did Mrs. Sara reach him? That I didn't know skip it This ham seems to be not very good. It can't be, I cured it myself. Well, he suffered a relapse, because he has a very bad face. You're ready for the autopsy. Good at least I fill my sorrows with bread . Not long before the festivities of the Patron Saint of the People. They are good days to take alms and go through money for the dispensary. And why don't we take care of the festivities. so fallen, fallen for the dispensary. Let's see explain more clearly. I said that we spoke with the authorities so that they do not grant the tax concession. And it is already a saving. We form the celebration board . And I take care of the music, the restaurants of the stalls and the dancing. The idea seems good. I'm going to think about it. Father Sebastián, I have learned something that deeply worries me. I understand that he has a good intention, but I see the need to attract his attention. Don Silvestre called me to make a complaint. This is the first lessons of catechism. You have put into children's minds certain ideas that I consider highly prejudicial. Like which Father? Well, he told the boys that Lander his parents that their work effort should be in proportional salary. Of course, because they charge more than they work, they charge less. But if they work more than they earn, they earn more. And do you know that these theories have already started to make trouble? And that several workers presented Don Silvestre asking him for a salary increase? - Well, how good! - Good because? remember that care must be taken that wealth is not accumulated in the hands of the wealthy. And they are distributed among the workers. But this is communism. No Doña Sarah. This is the encyclical of His Holiness Pius XI. And his holiness John twenty-three in his encyclical says ... that workers must earn enough to have a standard of living ... Truly human that allows them to support their family. But the way you approach it can bring problems. I don't think so, because His Holiness Leon thirteen for the year of 1891 ... He said in his encyclical that the State must help the proletarian class. Because of work and effort of the worker I came out of the wealth of the States. This said time has passed and nothing has happened. No, it is a mistake to want to end the rich, you have to first of all with the poor, Father. Does this not say it in the encyclical? That's what I said. Because ending poverty, there will be more equity in the world. How is it possible that you are so forgetful and so distracted ... are the encyclicals known by heart? Is that my novitiate put me as punishment learn them. One day in the presence of the Lord Archbishop. He says he expected great benefits from the current economic contest. Ecumenical. Well, economics ... well, that will punish me. Well, and what are the benefits that you expect Father Sebas? Well, little things that you want, more or less serious, less sad the Church. Why should the Church be sad? on the contrary, that there is joy. Why their wrinkled noses and their serious faces? Why should you speak in a low voice, almost secretly, as if hiding something? Well, I would like to see smiles and happy people at home. And then those penances of humble people. And those promises that make you go to pray to the virgin on your knees ... and they bleed. Well the Virgin is our Mother And what mother will like it ... see your children suffer? I had been warned that his fault was to make personal comments ... in ecclesiastical affairs. But I thought that you can not call default. Damn Sara! Well, I was wrong, get excited. That this ham does not taste like ham. It tastes like muffler. What did you do with car oil? Who will be these hours? Don't bother Suzanita, I'm going to open. - Goodnight! - Good night son! Excuse me, but are you the new Little Father? New, new, not much to say. What's on offer? My wife is dying and she wants you to go. Of course not, with pleasure. Wait here and let's go right now. This way Father. I am Father Sebastián, daughter. I come to help you. I'm dying little father. The body is what dies. The soul begins to live. A better life. Lord, have mercy on ... Jesus Christ prayed for her ... Holy Mary, have mercy on her. Saint Abel, pray for her. Choir of Cusco, pray for her. Bravo! Bravo, little father. With you until it is a pleasure to die. After this I am approved as a priest. And I approve of him as the son of Satan. Note that I do not fund, I am glad that you are so mean, so perverse. Why men like you is to make possible the Christian religion. Without Barabbas there would have been no comparison. And without cures there would have been no crucifix. Not even the miracle of resurrection. And as for you who want to mock God. Know that because at night the universal flood fell. Or died worth them no more dew. Or suffer the fate of the seven plagues. And you who didn't say so many No more than one will fall. The cough, which just gives the oxen yes. I'm sure you 're going to grab him. And your daughter, when I decide to really die. You can call me back. What I will be happy to help you die. Forgive us Lord, what do you know what you are doing. I know what he said. And now what happens Suzanita? Nothing. Are you sure nothing is wrong? Yes. Well, in case you offer something or you need a friend to talk to. You warn me. - Father Sebas. -Yes. - If I need it. - I already know it. I am very ashamed father. and very hurt. This afternoon I went out with Marcos. Get him accompanied to visit his tunca. To see the foal that had it to match. But he showed that he does not bring good intentions with me. What do you think I am like those other girls. With which he is used to going out. I never want to see him. Calm down, calm down, Suzanita, don't be hasty. If it hurts, it's because you want it. If you want it then because it hurts. But these things have fix. That yes better to find out to me if their intentions are good. No Father, please. Don't go talk to him. I would die of shame if he were to throw me on my side. If I go on behalf of anyone. I'm on my side like who says. Because these things are delicate and ay that agárralas. Do not worry. That very early tomorrow, I know where to find it. In the canteen. What are you doing here Father? You cannot enter. Well, trust that you can. In addition, outside the board, children, women, minors are prohibited ... uniformed military, but as a priest says nothing. I would like to speak to you, young man. With me? For what? Do you want to have a drink? For me, a curaçau. And you, Father? It gives me a chorreão ... But make it a pot. What do you want to talk to me about? From Suzana. I don't think you will be good to her, let's say. Look, father, these are the things of men and women. And better not get involved What ... I don't want difficulties with the clergy. What happens is that you are richer, you are used to making your whims. And don't you understand that Suzana wants it? But you want it, the right way and not the short hair you want to take. Look, Band-Aid, don't be nosy where it doesn't matter. But I do care, that you don't understand things. And I have to beg him to behave well with Susana, who likes man. A little girl with good feelings, from good families, Contrary hair, you will regret it. It threatens me? Well, the Priests cannot threaten. But I agree. Do I threaten who? Why don't you leave me and leave me alone. Because peace cannot leave with conscience ... as cochinota as it has. and to leave because I am right. So people don't see me chat with ... certain people. God accompany you. Better to stay with you, what else do you need. A almsgiving hair the love of God. Alms for the dispensary. Alms. The first day twice. Alms for the dispensary, thanks. A alms-haired love of God. Thank you. Just a certain Mr. Municipal President? It is all I have on me. Well look below. Does the best count taxes? Ah it looks good. A alms hair the love of God. Here, you have your change for what you gave me. Daddy gave you a weight. You don't come. I know my accounts. Thank you. Oh You are not. They are from the family. Father Sebas. Was it given to me because you don't say the sermon? Me? But a sermon never says so . Because it's time for you to start. Well, I'm very busy getting a few pennies from the heathens. Don't say it like that. Well, those who pay are not pagans? Go, go to the pulpit. Good Dear brothers of mine. Dear parishioners. Here you have me before you to divide the word. And this beautiful morning when the birds sled. And this time we will remember a passage from the Lord. The Last Supper. The Lord was surrounded by his disciples. Surrounded by his apostles. We could say, from their ministers. Daily the Lord undertook great walks ... to make their predicaments. Followed by his disciples, who advised him. But what advice should the Lord already know about everything? Because daily, the Lord followed by his apostles who loved him. Towards death in its small strips. that I had received by the crowds. These crowds of people. That they were paying. Because the Lord, in a way, was a revolutionary. A revolutionary who held the banner of truth. Who held the banner of goodness. Not like many I know who grab what they can and leave. Tonight... The Lord was sad. A Peña seized his soul and his disciples I have noticed. Then, Pedro, who lovingly asked Pedriño the boy. Lord, what is the matter with you? That you tend, that I see them sad. That I see you crestfallen. And the Lord raising his face and his sweet gaze said ... Yes A rock seizes me because tonight one of you will betray me. How? They all turn around and say. -Names! The Lord said nothing. The Lord was very discreet. And he did not want to know the tares among his disciples. But it was true. Unfortunately it was true. One of his ministers he had already sold. Well that's nothing. But would you know that he had still sold for thirty dollars. What perfidy. But this is worth a price. A minister would have done the business. If hanging on a tree. If they did, we would all lack trees. The forests would end. Yes, my dear brothers. They took the Lord on Calvary. Where they crucified him. where he died for us sinners. For us, who do not understand, who forget it. And so you hide that sacrifice from the Lord. They think they come here expensive churrias. The whole appears here to cross itself light- hearted . You are wrong. The Lord would be happier. If they knew fulfill their obligations. Mexicans and ecclesians. I just came to ask you, because most of you ... come to ask, the Lord who gives me this, Lord gives me another. Pure to ask, pure to ask, but nothing to give. Not that I say the alms tray will give me. So my dear brothers. So my dear parishioners. You have to think things over. It is very easy to distinguish good from evil. Thus, in the forests and fields. The humble murcia flowers are born with less color. And that you felt the morning breeze ... that the Lord sends us. those flowers that are humble old women , but that represent someone. He always has evil at his side. And who is evil? These "Wild" herbs. The 'Wild Herbs'. That the juice removes them, that exploits them and that bends them little by little. Until they lose even the colors, these flowers of the field. Good dear brothers. Now we go there message from our sponsor, I say. Sorry, we are going to see the Mass for Father Damien. Don't forget those words. It is time for us to meditate. It is time to reconsider. It is time for us to think. Ya ... Will alms blow me up? Oh no, here it is! Good brothers, good morning and may God be with you No, don't help me. I know little I will nail. We cannot surpass this. I do not think we should let another day go by. And send at once a letter to the bishopric of Mexico ... Explaining all the things that Band-Aid did. Yes, and the outrages he said in the pulpit. Do you know that the valero plays and another day it was the cantina ... and the data was put down by a Dominican. And he beat me. And he dances in the bell tower when calling to Mass, I saw him. Ay to see the ideas you instill in children at school. And what does he say when he asks for alms. He seems to be selling taco. And the personal part against me. What I said in the pulpit insulting me ... calling me grass. So I ask you to sign that document once ... I'm going to write myself explaining everything ... and that we ask him to take you out of town with roasts. According? I am full of doubts about Father Sebastián. I know they want to send a letter to the Bishopric asking him to take it away. Indeed I throw a lot of nonsense. But it was with good intention. You have not committed any serious fault. I am concerned that my resistance is due to how badly I do things. Or if perhaps my selfishness, the fear that comes to occupy my post ... It makes me exaggerate your mistakes. Do not worry so much. In the end it will be or God willing. Now let's go to dinner. Oh, but were they all here? Yes, we were in the next room. With me? Father Sebastián, my sister tells me that she found in her room ... A bottle of rum. Yes, he did not give me lemon caipineira because he did not have cash. And what do you think I should do? Well, some free ice cubes. Before dinner they fall very well. The novelty, yes Father, that the parties are going to leave at full throttle. Because there is a lot of enthusiasm. We throw some luxury castles from Bengal. This more than says what we are going to burn all the powder in hell. I already contacted Moreliano by phone . That he is the best bullfighter of the season. For this toree that day. Oh, there will be bulls. Yes Doña Sara. There will be two parents, so that everything is very religious. Look what work it took me to convince Moreliano. Because it was very metallic, I didn't want to accept what I offered. Well, how much did he offer you? Nothing. But I explained it and convinced him ... I said, look, it's a charity. It is a run that the parish organizes to collect funds. So you expose Case you hold the bull, case if you are sold, is in quites with divine providence. He was already so happy. Don't worry, Father, things are going to be very good. And we will have enough money. Good fish! There is no richer or better used food. Whenever it is past. To me, the greatest without spine, Doña Sara. Serenade? It seems to be on the doorstep of the house. Who was the rooster attracted to? There is no way that you are, because instead of a rooster you had attracted a cob. But it misses me, because today I don't comply. Anyway, I'm going to see who it is. And you? I'm doing great, thanks! I ask you why you are an astronaut. Which astronaut? Well, he is very happy with his little rocket. And since that is not a way to present yourself in a decent house. I wish you good luck and that you continue to cocaine with your straw. Mire story. To me, you, the clergy and the prelates. Stop there, you are the bare one. Because in my house, poor, but very decent. - Said prelate! - And I said bare! I want to see Suzana and I will leave until I leave. Well Suzana won't come out until you leave. Why you are not going to get away with, less when your supposed, not yours. Why are you so picky? Because the same that is in the bliche. And I advise you to leave or as soon as possible ... and be sooner better. And you think that you will run like that as Christians? Why not, Christ ran the Pharisees out of the temple . In ways that, good evening, Lord Don Pharisee. Either Suzana leaves or I enter. Don't get violent. Don't say, as the drunks vulgarly say . Don't jump on me. That neither Suzana leaves nor you enter. Do you know that I can't stand it? I'm not asking to be charged, Youngster. Too bad you are a priest. But don't forget that I'm also a man. Oh yeah. Play "The Sore". Forgive me, sir, but it was in self-defense. He was very big. This afternoon we will go to the square to hang them ... so that people realize from today that tomorrow ... is the fair. And I have chamba Suzanita. You are going to take care of the sugar bolts post. But I never made sugar dumplings. But it matters little. I never did fairs. And to you that everything is doing very well. - Father Sebas? - Yes Suzanita. I still haven't given much thanks for helping me. You're welcome. You were very good at making ... Mom and my uncle don't count about anything. Didn't they notice? Hum! The Danube is the. .. four times he asks me: who carried the serenade. untibed area. What happened between Marcos and you? Nothing, the past is over . But I would like to give advice, do you want to hear it? Yes Father Sebas. Well, then, regarding that boy. I know you want it, but ... you better leave him alone. I think it's like the measles that fortunately gives us once ... ... and that does not give us again. And that Marcos is a very heavy measles and a little song. This is how to say it, because it was born in a manger, it presumes baby Jesus. What happened little girl? It hurts right? But you have to have will power. There is no need to cry. Because there is no evil that lasts 100 years, and there is no body that resists. Here are their enchiladas, tacos and their Carnatias and also their pambazotes. The hunger is over with me. So tasty, right? You have a taco, I count, You already owe me eight. come on, come on. A little coffee Father? But, man of God, because you walk like crazy ... from side to side. Because this way we save employees and we have more money for the dispensary. But let's not exaggerate. The only thing missing is that you announced the bearded woman. Oh, how good he remembered, why the thong is going to start. Will is not lacking. You are deciding why the party is a success. I'd like to talk with you. It takes over. - Do you want to go up? - Not! Look Suzanita, I don't like saying these things ... but no way, I have missed you very much. I need to see you, talk to you. We have nothing to talk about Marcos. I've already shown what kind of people they are. And I have nothing to do with a ... man like you. Is that what advised the successful band-aid that? Yes! And thanks to him I have the strength to say that he left me ... and don't come looking for me again. He who bites with his tail ... Araclán. Until I overcome the rain ... Umbrella To the one who pulls twelve o'clock ... bells. The cage of the poor. Sun. Lottery. I won. Effectively. It was good and I'm leaving. Can you keep the beans my son? Well, what about the prize? The prize is to help God. Blessed are the meek of spirit ... ... For theirs will be the kingdom of heaven. Listen. Why don't you give me a carnita? Well, she's drowning. No, I know how to swim and I know how to keep clothes. You keep the clothes, the watch, the rings, the contracts and everything you have in your hands. What happened to this bullfight? What time will it start? At four o'clock, PM. The announced time. What to say the day after tomorrow or the day after the meridian? It means Moreliano past. It doesn't take long to arrive. Is nothing known about Moreliano? Nothing father. Will it have been composed in charge? Mr. Municipal President, how much do you charge for entry? 3000 pesos a little more or less. Oh, try to make it more than less. - Father Sebastián! - What's up Don Felipe? I bring you bad news. Possibly they won't be as bad as the old ones. An urgent telegram arrived from Moreliano. And what does it say? "Break my sacrum bone, impossible to fight this afternoon." "I'm on a crutch." But it is very natural, being a bullfighter. "I return your blessing in advance , greetings." Then the tickets will have to be returned . - All good? - Yes Dad! He called again and the bullfighter said he put in the telegram. Oh, you have to send him the money tomorrow. Very good son. You will see this band-aid or what it is to face Don Silvestre. Man of God, what are you going to do? But Father, we don't need this money in the dispensary. We will not return tickets. I have already entrusted myself to Santa Verónica and "San Cornelio". And who throws the torillo. God, hold me in your heights. It's not all bad. Torea ben that little father. This is how you fight. Much, Father Sebas, much. Fights like the angels themselves. Long live little father. Oh Father, if you don't make me take off , take off. But this hostel comes to buree. Bullfighter, bullfighter ... I have asked him to meet to show them what it would be ... It is an injustice to send this letter to Miter. Father Sebastián has many defects ... he is nervous, stubborn, he replied. But I ask you, which of us is perfect? Even some Saints who made mistakes. Father Sebastián with those little faults ... it has great virtues, and above all a magnificent intention. He wants there to be more love and understanding among men ... So that we live with more brotherhood. I know that Father Sebastián is sometimes somewhat stuck ... He is also very clever in teaching us many things. Thanks to him, his effort and dedication ... the dispensary will soon be a reality. And the children, our children, will already begin to study. And even myself, since he has come, I have learned to see ... things differently. We all try to make life impossible ... Because without reason or reason we forget the Christian spirit. We consider him our enemy. And he, in response, extended his hand. Father Damián is right, we have been a cost. And the document we sign must be burned immediately. Wait a moment, gentlemen, just that Don Silvestre sent that letter to the post. And I'm so sorry about the mail that's serious. Letter put, letter delivered. - Do not be like that! - Turn a blind eye! I swear I'm very sorry gentlemen, but I can not, no. It would be as much as sacrificing my career. And this letter will leave for your destination by truck this afternoon ... without there being anything preventing it. However, without ceasing to be the employee ... trusted by that government, there could be a solution. Loud standing there. Amoeba the truck, I mean, hands. Let's go! Low. Pass the mail bag. Come on, hurry up. Hurry up, it's too late. Thank you very much, little Father, what do you say about being kind ... There is no need to argue. I'm glad we made peace. Glory to God in the highest ... and peace on earth to the ladies of good will. I am also very happy Doña Sara that ... the war is over. Because I hope I have enough water to give a full bath and ... let there be light in my bedroom. The only thing it takes to be completely happy is ... a glass of brandy, after each of my six meals. - Six? - Well, make it three. Oh no, not even three Father Sebas! This cognac is my brother's privilege. Well, what does the official taster of the order not have? Sorry father, but that cognac is over 100 years old. And we take care of it as gold in cloth. Hard to peel the old one. Oh, sorry Suzanita. I did not remember that she is your mother. Don't worry, you're right, "Hard to peel." Well Father, now I am going to school, the children are not long in coming. Yes Suzanita, don't be late. And don't remove it from the griddle, until you know everything. A hundred years. Wait. Sue I have thought a lot about things and well , I realized that ... I love you I love you good. Hair straight way, As Father Sebastián says. And I have to apologize, for the bad ... that I carried with you. - Frames. With confidence children. Don't worry about me, what is right ... it doesn't bother me. How good that I see it, Little Father. I wanted to say that thanks to you I understood many things. And the most important of all ... that Suzana loved him good. I'm glad Marcos thinks that way. But it seems to me that his Father is going to fall very well. Don't worry, I'll talk to him today. - Are you crazy! I will not allow you Marcos. I'm sorry dad. But with your permission or not I will formalize relations ... with Suzana to marry her. Ah yes, I want to know how you earn your life. Because what is mine is not going to see a single penny. I do not care. I'm so sorry you put yourself like this. Because I would have liked that things were for the good. I'm sure the fault all this is ... of that curita convict. Indeed, thanks to him we all in the village do ... removed the blindfold. And we see clearly for the first time. - Matías! - Yes, boss. He happens to take an urgent message to Father Damián. Right now I'm going to write a letter. I'm sorry to tell you that you can forget it ... the promise I made to give away the land for the dispensary. But things have come up that keep me from keeping my word. But that someday I explain the reasons. Silvestre Manzano. What could have happened? Why this change? With people like Don Silvestre, you never know what's going to happen. You never know which leg the mule is going to kick with. How is it possible, Lord, if he had already promised to give you the land. A fact. Why is he refusing now? So big and so hard. Don't worry, father. Who gives and takes away with the devil takes revenge. And in La Puerta del Infierno you come out your corobita. That dispensary was the great ambition of my life. It hurts me that I ca n't do it. It was like the finishing touch of my ecclesiastical career. After I had built it, I could have safely retired. But now... Now it seems to me that my life was a failure. a resounding failure. I don't leave anything behind me. What do you mean, Father? Leave dear, leave many Christians ... and the best, a dispensary. - What does it say? I say that hope is the last thing that is lost Father. And we must wait until the last moment. Who removes some miracle happen. Now we have to do it to make him happy ... Well, I said, to raise your spirits, why not ... Shall we have a drink? A priest from the Archbishopric of Mexico has arrived. He says he wanted to speak to Father Sebastián alone. With me? That it seems to me that they were already with gossip from the bullfights. And do you suppose that you will get rid of it? What do you believe me? What will the silver ear bring me ? It is slowly waiting. Excuse me. That is all for today children, you can retire. I think the time has come when I was so afraid. What am I good at, excellence? Father Sebastian? To serve God and you Father. I am Father Juan José Romero. Visitor of the miter of Mexico Nice to meet you, Father. I have come to inform you that you are definitely staying ... in charge of this parish. We suppose that in these weeks you will already know what is current. And Father Danube, I say Damien? He should already withdraw. But why father? Due to his advanced age, he has been here for many years. You're already very old. Old man? Hey, sorry for my reverend contradicting you . But I believe that Father Damián still endures ... not long, but hold on. In addition I think that to be old to others. Well one is never an old man. Don't you remember the apostles. They all had beards and they were the ones who practiced religion all over the world. And aren't you going to tell me that San Pedro was a kid? For something San Ignacio de Loyola said, I do not know if he or San Juan de Tihuacán was ... That the old people's facts are small Gospels. Really, my reverend, believe me ... Father Damián Parish is taken away ... Well, it's going to kill him. And you agree that one of the commandments says ... You will not kill. Well, do you remember? I censor his passion and at the same time admire ... your loyalty. But things must be like this, father. Remember that one of our first obligations ... is knowing how to obey. Yes, Father, yes excellence. But there is one thing. You have one point of view and I have another. Like who says, we are counterpoint. As the time, we add A bollard, an aguilozol. And we come to the process who is right. Let's see serious, Father Sebastián. Yes excellence. If when I get out, I plan to play alms money ... stop to see if I can multiply them. Like the multiplication of fish. then there will be more money for charity. And I also plan to teach choir children ... modern music why not I don't want any sadness ... no organ, no sir, i will buy your electric guitars ... With its respective battery. How do you see it? Do you feel good Father Sebastián? I feel like an excellence rifle. And do you know what I'm going to do with the facade of the parish? I'm going to paint red and yellow stripes .... Yes sir, so that they can see from far away. And the calls to mass I will not make with bells ... No sir, how awful, I'm going to do it with Mariachis. For people to get up happy. And the Church is not sleepy ... and no more rocking nodding, no Lord. To the children, I am going to distribute parrots, and large colored parrots, to make them colorful. And the adults will distribute tacos, enchiladas, chalopitas ... a kind of devotee to endure. Because Father Damien's sermon, well, they are a little boring. We will be beautiful, Father. What happens is that you have to do propaganda, a lot of publicity. And I invite you to the inauguration, it will be beautiful. It will be beautiful. Yes... Look, Father, all those revolutionary theories ... That you have exposed me, indicate their lack of experience ... I think he still lacks a lot of preparation for ... take over a parish ... and of a parishioner. Yes excellence. I think you are quite right. What happens, rather, also, because I am a Father of the new wave, do you think? It is possible yes. But perhaps it is better that he still spend a few years in the diaconate. To finish training. So you can see things more clearly. We will leave Father Damián plus one season. This is fine for you to see. When I get to see them, they call me to give them a soak. No more Father Sebas was missing. Here we are waiting. Have a little father, it's the Cognac one. Have a glass after each meal. Just one. Just a Mrs. Sarah? Why are you limiting me? The ones you want, Little Father. And don't forget about us. Thank you very much Doña Sara. I'm going to miss your bat dock a lot . Thank you little girl. Very nice mole. Thank you, Father Sebas. Thank you. Thanks from what Father? I ran away from behind the door, his talk with the prelate. Oh yes, like who were you spying on. You already know that prying is a sin. So I am going to have to confess. Don't be shy Father, don't be shy. Which is very ugly than a show. You have to be strong. If you even cry, there is no one to stop me. Take good care of yourself, Father Danube. See you later Don Prospero. Goodbye Father, don't forget us. I do not forget them. And don't forget to lower your taxes a little. Because they are already very strong. See you later, Don Felipe. Write us Father. Wait for my bells. Goodbye Anica. Goodbye, little father, go on ... you cutting ears. And you poisoning people. See you later, apothecary. May God give us health. But as long as there wo n't be your recipes. Let me Father. Here is a gift. Thank you very much Ana María. Here I bring you these oranges father. Here is a porquito Father. Look how beautiful. They are already giving me the carnita. Thank you, my children. I thank you very much for loving me a little more ... than when I arrived. But that's life. One, suddenly at first glance fell fat but ... then one will identify with you. I hope to see you again someday ... May you be very well. In the meantime, I beg you ... strongly, that they take good care of Father Danube ... I say Damián ... Well, like San Injerêncio said. Well, I'm not going, but he will take me. But I hope you guys continue to behave like ... I have advised them in a good way. And that ... well, dear, like someone says ... The sidewalks will remove but the love, when? So keep ben with the children. And he agrees, from time to time, Father Sebastián. Goodbye, my children. Father. Father Sebas. You know, I've wanted to come fire him. And to tell him that I will miss him. And as they say, and thank you in front of everyone. But I also want you to know that I have still changed my mind. But that yes. Thanks to you I have understood ... That men need each other. Very good Don Silvestre. Because if I pit you, I will also remember. Because, although you fell very fat. Well, it will be very boring not to know who to fight with. Goodbye Don Silvestre. Goodbye. And God take care of him until he wants it. Don't cry Sara, I'm sure we'll see him again. Are we called a sip for two? Father Sebastián is no longer done . Or maybe he cheated on me by going crazy? Oh no? Father Damien stays here by my decision. But you are going to another parish. Where there is another very old priest . And you have already shown me that you know ... inject youth. Ah Now I find it to be like ralegión? Yes. Created by Kilo. Cantinflas - 100 years.
