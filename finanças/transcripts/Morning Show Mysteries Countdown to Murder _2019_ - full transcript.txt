Ahhhhhh!!! Please... don't... Just who I was looking for, Billie Blessings, my favourite chef. Hey, Phil. Can I ask you a question? Sure. Uh, any idea where Lucy put the ingredients? No, no, but speaking of Lucy, um... is she- is she seeing anybody or...? Our Lucy? You mean like dating? Just a question. Don't make it into a thing. Uh, hey Lucy. We have a problem. Fairweather Markets didn't make the delivery. What? I've been trying to call but I can't get anyone to answer the phone. I've gotta start making this pasta. I know, I'm so sorry, I'd go out right now but we just don't have time. Alright, people. No lallygagging, we have a show to do, tick-tock tick-tock. Alright, what kind of snacks do we have? Gummy bears? Chocolate drops? Do you ever have one of those days? Oh, you know the kind I mean. The kids have baseball, the boss kept you late, you're supposed to bring dessert to the pot luck and you haven't had time to buy groceries. That is exactly what my day was like yesterday. The question is can dessert be saved? I'll bet the answer is yes. Absolutely right, 'cause all you need are chocolate and eggs, and in 20 minutes you can serve this. Wow. Two ingredient emergency cake. She's supposed to be doing easy bake ziti. Mmm, tasty, too. Come back after the break and we'll show you small space storage ideas. Maurice Terrebone, you still standing there? What am I gonna do with two bushels of rutabaga? You saw Billie's show. Apparently you missed the message. Work with what you get. Hey, guys. Hi. Ok, what're we making with rutabaga? Oh, well, Fairweather Market missed the delivery and by the time I got to the farmer's market there wasn't much left. They missed the delivery at the studio, too. Time to find a new grocery store. Maurice! We're loyal customers. Something's wrong. I've been calling all day, they have not answered the phone. Well, why don't you go to the store? We can take care of the restaurant. You sure? Yeah. Thank you. This is a surprise. I thought we were getting together later tonight. What's going on? Is everything Ok? You know Art Fairweather, right? Yeah, that's like an understatement. I practically grew up here. He was my father's friend. Oh no. Art? I'm so sorry. Ok, I'm impressed. You scooped the story before the local news. Do his children know? Yeah, they're out back. He was a friend. Tell her I'm sorry, Ok? Yeah. I can't believe this. Jay, I'm so sorry. Tess is the one who found him. She's been here since the alarm company called. Do you think you could take her home? No. No, I can't leave. Not until we find out what happened. This could take a while. Your brother's right. Maybe you should get some rest. Yeah, don't worry. Hey. I'll stay. This whole thing feels like a bad dream. I keep trying to wake up. When the alarm company called I told them my father must have set the alarm off by mistake. I keep wanting to call him. It doesn't seem fair. He just got back to the store. The court case was settled, the stores were back in business. He didn't have time to enjoy it. This is all my fault. Tess... I never should have let him go to the store alone. Not after that fight with his partner. You can't blame yourself. Jay knew this would happen. That's why he made my father use the alarm. Ok, I'm sure there's an explanation for this. Why don't we just wait and see what the police have to say? Hey. Thank you for helping. I didn't think Tess could take much more. Did you find out anything? No. The police think it was an accident. The shelves fell. Tess said you don't think it's an accident. I know it sounds paranoid but they found something with my father's body. What is this? I think it's a message. From my father's partner, Edmond Stokes. The one that tried to take over the company? Yeah. And he hated the way my father ran the stores. You know the little toys that we give children at the cash register? It was one of the things they fought about. Edmond said my father was throwing money away. He wouldn't try to kill your father over a toy. He was crazy, Billie. When the judge gave the company back to my father Edmond said that he would destroy us. We had to hire security guards to get him out of the store and the expression on his face? I've never seen anything like it. It was pure hate. People say things when they're angry. It's what Tess said. I knew my father's life was in danger the moment that Edmond lost that fight. Could you send me that photo? I can't believe it. I just saw Art Fairweather last week. He was bragging about his fitness tracker. Jay thinks he was murdered. Murdered? By his former partner, Edmond Stokes. No, no. Let's not get carried away. Jay isn't himself. He just lost his father. And he and his wife have those two little girls, they adored their grandfather. Hey, does Fairweather Markets still give out those little children's toys? You know, at the checkout counter? Mmmhmm. A basket at every register. It stopped once Edmond took over but the first thing Art did when Edmond left was bring those baskets back. What kind of toys? Baby animals, mostly. Hedgehogs, frogs... Ducks? You're too old for toys. Why are you asking? The police found a toy duck with Art's body. Someone crossed the eyes out. Jay showed me. It all seems so creepy. Like I said, Jay is grieving. He's probably just trying to make sense out of all of this. And why wouldn't there be a toy? There's toys all over the place. Hmm. I have dinner with Emma and Ian tonight. I'm gonna ask Ian what he thinks. Oh, I suggest you don't. Well, it's not your job to figure out whether or not Art Fairweather was murdered. You and Ian just started seeing each other again. Don't muddy the waters. Muddy the waters? No shop talk. You focus on that relationship. If you don't it won't thrive. How is it that you always end up giving me relationship advice, no matter what we're talking about? Girl, I've been married three times. I'm an expert. I would- No. But that- Not another word! Chicken pot pie. I hope you don't mind. I had a sudden craving for comfort food. Well, I'm not surprised after what happened this morning. Oh, these are beautiful. For you. I thought they might help. Ian. Yeah. It's the least I could do. Plus, you were in charge of dinner. How did I get so lucky? You took the words right out of my mouth. How are you doing? Art was a good man. And I know you hear that about people but it was really true. The kids must be really taking it hard. Homework finished. Perfect timing. You hungry? Yeah, me too. So I said the dough isn't actually cake. The heat causes chemical reactions that turn it into cake. And then I showed how the heat changes the egg and the baking soda. And then we ate it. Spoken like a true baker. Which reminds me, there's a new exhibit at the science museum. We should go see it this weekend. That sounds like fun. Cassandra said she'd take me so you two could go to the salsa festival. Salsa festival? At the waterfront. It's grown-ups only. Since Saturday is Billie's half birthday she thought you should go. I don't really dance, as you know. I know, which is why we signed you up for a class. A class. It starts the day after tomorrow. Aunt Cassandra said she'd babysit. Aunt Cassandra. Thank you. The Fairweather Supermarket fed has ended on a sombre note with the unexpected death of the beloved founder, Art Fairweather. Art Fairweather recently regained control of the company after his partner, Edmond Stokes, made an unsuccessful bid to take it over. Hey. I'm so sorry about what happened. So am I. You know, my uncle used to work there. He started as a stock boy. He was always saying that Fairweather Market was kinda like his second family. Yeah, I think a lot of people felt that way. So I brought double of everything, two different stores just in case. But maybe you could check it? I didn't get a whole lot of sleep last night. Yeah. Hey, where'd he come from? Oh, I think they found it at the store. Well, I know that little guy. You do? He kind of reminds me of the ducks from the video I used to watch when I was a kid. Except without the weird x's on the eyes. We got the medical examiner's report. Time of death between 5 and 6am. Cause of death, blunt force trauma from the collapsing shelves. They ruled it an accident. It wasn't an accident. If it was an accident why'd the alarm go off? Tess Fairweather said her father hated technology and that they always made him set the alarm when he was alone in the store so maybe he set it off by accident. But why go inside? If the alarm was tripped why not call the alarm company? Or the police? Ok, but here's the thing. The medical examiner won't change their ruling without more evidence. More evidence? Maybe we should get another look at those shelves. I'd love to, but it looks like you've got a lunch date. I think I found something. Yeah. Ok. ♪ Five little ducks went out one day, ♪ ♪ Over the hill and far away, ♪ ♪ One little duck said "quack, quack, quack" ♪ ♪ And only four little ducks came... ♪ It's a countdown song. The red duck was first. Let's hope Art Fairweather was just adding a toy to the baskets at the registers. Because if someone left it, there could be four more victims. How's Jay doing? Oh... a little on edge, to be honest. I'm afraid he might do something crazy. He's convinced that Edmond was there that night. I wish I had never found that duck. You don't by any chance have surveillance cameras? Father was a trusting man. I guess we all were. I was thinking, maybe you could talk to Edmond. Me? You have a good sense of people. You could just see if you think Edmond's capable of something like this. If you don't then you might be able to calm Jay down. I'm sure the police will talk to Edmond if they have any concerns. But you have concerns, don't you? Isn't that why you're here? Is this a bad time? No, I was just leaving. We thought we'd just take another look at the store. Ok. The alarm company records show that the system was disarmed twice. The back door was disarmed at 5am and the front door was disarmed at 5:15. The system was re-armed both times, then it tripped at 5:30. So Art enters the store, sets the alarm like his kids tell him to, at 5:15. Yeah, but somebody was already here. The person that came in at 5. Maybe that person tripped the alarm on the way out after Art died. Yeah. These holes are clean. If it was an accident the screws would have stripped the wall. There's no screws. Not in this bracket... or in this one. Alright, let's get the crime tech out here. Alert the ME. It's about time. I knew it was Edmond. As soon as you found him. Let me guess. There was a sale. I presume Emma told you about the salsa festival? She did, and the class. Surprisingly, I didn't even realize it was my half birthday mainly because we never celebrate it. A terrible oversight which, thankfully, I have corrected. The secret to salsa is good shoes. These are professional. You're gonna have to take those back. Why? You're not going? Oh, we're going, thank you very much, but uh... Ian and I do not need your dating advice and I can buy my own shoes. Is that who I think it is? Edmond Stokes. Art Fairweather's partner. I was thinking about paying him a visit. Why would you do that? I have the perfect excuse. Both the restaurant and the morning show have accounts at the store. Did you or did you not tell me that that man might be a killer? That's what I'm trying to find out. We're meeting up this afternoon. Well, you're not going by yourself. Oh no. Look, Edmond Stokes hated our father. Right from the beginning I always knew that he was trouble. Ok, why don't you just start from the beginning? My father and Edmond's father were partners. My father started the store, then Edmond's father invested and they made it a chain. How many stores are there? Three. Edmond's father owned most of the company but he let my father run the stores the way he wanted because he respected my father. Said he wished Edmond was more like him, which drove Edmond crazy. As soon as Edmond's father died six months ago Edmond made plans to sell the company. Which he could do because he owned more shares. My father tried to block the sale so he fired him. And that's what started the fight. Yeah. And Edmond didn't know what he was getting into. The whole thing blew up. Workers went on strike, distributors stopped bringing food. The press had a field day. So your father came back. No. Edmond would have run this company right into the ground just to prove that he could do it. Buyer got cold feet. As soon as they backed out Edmond's wife took Edmond to court. His wife? Olivia Stokes. The judge said since they both inherited the shares she had a right to vote independently. So Edmond's wife turned against him? She could see what Edmond was doing. I mean, she didn't want him to destroy the stores any more than we did. I could understand why Edmond would get upset. Edmond Stokes never cared about this company. He was having a tantrum, like a little boy because his father liked my father better. And I thought this was a friendly family business. The wine bar? Let's see if we can get their footage. Mr. Stokes' boat is right this way. How did I not know that Edmond Stokes lived on a boat? Well, he's only been here the last three weeks. Moved out of his house when his wife took him to court. Hard to blame her. Doesn't seem like a very nice person. Trying to destroy a nice family business. Kind of ironic, right? Not a guy that likes to lose. You do know I get seasick, right? Come on. So, Billie Blessings, Fairweather Market's most loyal and high-profile customer. To what do I owe the pleasure? We're very sorry to hear about what happened to Art Fairweather and we wanted to offer our support. I find that hard to believe. As I'm sure you know I no longer have anything to do with Fairweather Markets. I was forcibly removed last month. True. That's a very good point. We should have thought of that. We did and we thought that possibly now that Art Fairweather is gone maybe things might change. Regrettably, no. While I still own a third of the company the board stripped me of all decision-making powers and perpetuity. Can I tell you why I think you came? Oh, I don't think you should bother yourself. I suspect Jay Fairweather showed you a little red duck and told you that I left the sinister message with the body of his poor, dead father. Absolutely not. Possibly. Well, I hate to spoil a good story but I was on this boat all night and there are plenty of people at the yacht club that will vouch for me. Well, it was lovely to chat. Consider a different perspective. I'm a scapegoat, and Tess and Jay Fairweather don't love their father the way they claim. This conversation is over. We need to go. I think your phone might be off. I called the restaurant. Cassandra said you were on your way home. Is everything Alright? I was thinking we could practise. Practise? For the salsa lesson. I mean I had some time before I get Emma. Or not. Ian, we need to talk. Why don't you come inside? You went to Edmond Stokes' boat and accused him of murder? No, he accused us of accusing him. Aunt Cassandra and I were just there to talk about the restaurant. Ok, I had my suspicions but I wasn't gonna say anything. Edmond was the one that brought it up. I thought he was playing with us. Maybe he thought you were playing with him. How did he know about that duck? Probably the same way you did. Tess or Jay Fairweather. Either one of them could have picked up a phone and accused him of leaving it. There is one more thing. I went back to the store after I dropped off Aunt Cassandra at the restaurant and noticed a surveillance camera at the wine bar next to the store. We're getting a warrant. You may not have to. The owner gave me this. That's Art going inside. 5:15, and look, 15 minutes later. Let's see if the tech department can zoom in on that license. See someone was there, Ian, and they could have gone inside. I talked to the dock master, he said that Stokes never left his boat yesterday and he drives a black sedan. Well, he knew about the duck so it's worth a conversation. Hey, how did Billie get the footage? She talked to the owner. I talked to the owner. He said he didn't want to get involved. I guess Billie changed his mind. Maybe I should start a cooking show. Cop in the Kitchen. What? It seems to open doors. Isn't that Stokes' boat? Yeah, the Victory. Looks like he's in a hurry. Looks like he knew we were coming. Call the Coast Guard, see if we can cut him off. Dive team's on their way. They said not to expect too much. The current's moving fast and the shelf drops off pretty quickly. Finding a body's gonna take some time. Hi. Hello. That's the dock master. Probably wasn't an accident, right? We can't comment. I'm just saying, I've seen engine fires before but nothing like that. So over here is Stokes' car. It's been parked here in the same spot for three weeks. He had me start it sometimes just to keep it going, but he never left the boat. That's pretty strange, right? I noticed the window was broken. I didn't touch anything. It wasn't like that yesterday, I'll tell you that. Have you noticed anything else unusual or suspicious? You know, two days ago I thought I saw someone climb out of the water under Stokes' boat. Me and Stokes searched the whole thing stem to stern, didn't find anything. But it could have been someone, right? They could have planted a bomb. Do me a favour. Don't tell anybody about this. No, I get it. Loose lips sink ships. Pun intended. Thank you. His boat blew up? And there was a message on his car. Where did you get that? My father belongs to the yacht club. One of the members is sending it around. That's another duck from the video that I showed you. The song? Wait, what song? Uh... I um... I forget what song. Art Fairweather just died two days ago. I have a feeling there might be a connection. I don't think we should jump to conclusions. This isn't even on the police blotter yet. We have an exclusive. Guys, we really should be careful here. We're already covering the story, Billie. Well, actually that would be me. Whoever left the picture of the duck is trying to spread fear. We don't wanna participate in that. We are not spreading fear. We are just sharing important information. Exactly. If there is a serial killer out there it is our civic duty to report it. Did I miss something? How did this become a serial killer? But the police haven't even released a statement yet. Ok, we gotta get going on this. The show airs in half an hour. Tiffany, let's get creative. Got it. Lucy, follow me. Thank you, Esmerelda. I'm sorry for your loss. I lost my husband a long time ago, Detective. Sometimes I wonder if I ever had him. The only person he really cared about was his father. It seems a little strange then, you siding with Art Fairweather in the supermarket fight. I tried not to get involved, believe me. But, contrary to my husband's accusations, I'm not made of ice. Edmond was driving the company to ruin over a childish vendetta. I could see what he was doing to that family. So are you close with the family? I wouldn't say close, but someone had to stop the madness. That was thoughtful of you. I'd like to think that Edmond's father left the company to both of us to make sure that there were certain protections in place. So now that Edmond has passed you control the company, don't you? Along with Tess and Jay Fairweather, yes. But you own two thirds of the shares. Let me save you some time, Detective. I have no idea how to blow up a boat. And I was home last night. Esmerelda was with me. She can give you a statement. Art Fairweather, owner of Fairweather Market, died two days ago and now a second owner, Edmond Stokes, is believed dead after an explosion on his boat this morning. ♪ One little duck said "quack, quack, quack" ♪ ♪ Only one little duck came back" ♪ ♪ One little duck went out one day... ♪ One of these ducks was found at each crime scene. Maybe you remember the song. I know I do. It was a countdown song. So ladies, what do we think? Art Fairweather got the first duck, a red duck. He's dead. And now Edmond Stokes, the second mysterious death, received an orange duck. Duck number two. Could this be a pattern? I think it's too early to speculate. Well, it seems clear to me. There are three ducks left. Yellow, blue, green. And Fairweather Markets has three more owners. Art Fairweather's two children, Tess and Jay, and Edmond Stokes' widow, Olivia. Could one of them get duck number three? Who's next? According to Edmond Stokes' lawyer, Edmond didn't have a will. But he served his wife divorce papers the day he moved onto the boat. If the divorce had gone through she would have lost a lot of money. And you'd think she would have tried harder to seem upset. You know, that maid wasn't convincing either when she said Olivia was home. The question is why would Olivia kill Art Fairweather? Check this out. A week after his father died Edmond Stokes wrote a cashier's check for $100,000 to Fairweather Markets. He hated Art Fairweather. So why would he give him so much money? What's the date on that cheque? April 15th. Edmond called Jay Fairweather that day. Actually, he called him a lot. It started six months ago, right after he inherited the company. How much would Jay have to say to the guy who was hijacking his father's store? Maybe Jay was a little too upset. You wanna bring him in? No. Let's put a tail on him and see what he does next. And see if you can find out where the money went and that cheque. So much for keeping the story quiet. ♪ Five little ducks went out one day. ♪ 75,000 hits. You do know how dangerous it was going out to that boat. I mean, what if it had exploded with us on board? I know. I'm so sorry I made you go. That's not the only reason you're worried though, is it? I guess the police won't be too happy with that story. And Ian's gonna think I'm responsible. But Lance did the story, not you. Yeah, but I'm the one who found the duck song. And Ian knows I went to see Edmond and I might have found some surveillance footage. Is this what you meant when you said "don't muddy the waters"? No, you get that thought right out of your head. That man is crazy about you, anybody can see that. Yeah, but I just keep making his life more complicated. You want my advice? You just put a big smile on that face and you salsa. Your first lesson is tonight. Oh, once you start to move all your cares will just fall away, trust me. Seven left foot, we go one, two, three, back five, six, seven, side one, two, three, five, six, seven. Good. You guys ready for music? Alright, music please. Five, six, seven, eight. This is fun. We're doing great. Is it a bad time? It's Ok. I'll take a rain cheque. Goodnight. Goodnight. Sorry to show up like this without calling. I found you in my father's address book. Who even uses those anymore? Well, I'm just glad you came. It's not the same anymore. Not since Edmond tried to take over. Everybody's on edge. It's hard to know who to trust. Is that why you're here? Because there's someone you can't trust? No... I just... I'm not sure what the police would think if they found out. Found out what? Three weeks ago, right after my father came back to the store, he and my brother had a fight. My father accused Jay of working with Edmond, trying to sell the store. Jay denied it. My father said Edmond showed him a contract. Edmond claimed he gave Jay money. Jay said Edmond was lying, trying to upset my father. Tess. Once my father calmed down he realized Edmond was trying to turn us against each other, but people in the store heard. I'm afraid somebody might say something to the police. You need to say something to the police. I need to find out if Jay's in trouble. He's all I have left. If I go to the police my relationship with him is over. Tess, I really wish I could help you here but I'm sorry. I just can't. Can I help you? Hi. Sorry, did I scare you? Don? I didn't think you'd recognize me out of context. Of course I recognize you. Uncle Don, where did you go? I got a little turned around coming back from the restroom. Wait, Don is your uncle? Do you guys know each other? Of course we do. Fairweather Market. Billie Blessings has been buying my tomatoes for 15 years? Cool. So what're you doing here? Oh, uh, Lance is interviewing him. Because I got fired. After Art Fairweather came back I guess he didn't like the fact that I kept working during the strike. Not taking sides, I just didn't want to abandon my customers. With all due respect it really upset me, you know? Them fighting like that? Not thinking about the people that they were hurting, you know, the workers, the distributors, the customers. Sorry, it's still... it still gets me riled up. Uncle Don still hasn't found another job. That's terrible. No, it's-it's Ok. It's only been a few weeks. So, this may sound weird, but would you ever consider working at a restaurant? Uh, really? Uh, yeah, sure. Why not? Why don't you stop by after the show? Uh, nice try. I see what you're trying to do here. Scooping my interview? Remember, you did walk away from this story, Billie. This... this story is mine. Uh, right this way please, Don. Um... nice to see you again. You know where he's taking him, right? My editing suite. Lance has been camped out in there since yesterday going over that footage. It's not even his story. I found it. By the way... Very funny. Where did you find that? Look at you. Butter wouldn't meltin your mouth. As if you didn't know. I found it earlier in my jacket pocket. Lance, I-I need- Billie, I am a seasoned reporter. If you thought you could scare me off that easily... You thought wrong. I hope this won't take long. I have no idea why Edmond wrote that cheque. But you must have known about it, right? A cheque that size, it must have been surprising. Nothing Edmond did surprised me. Did he ever have any meetings with Jay Fairweather? I suggest that you ask Jay Fairweather that question. You could have written that cheque yourself, correct? You have access to both accounts? Why would I do that? Maybe to get money out of your shared account. Hire a divorce lawyer. Sorry to chat and run but we're going to have to pick this up later. Enjoy your massage. Nobody saw anything unusual? No. Nobody other than studio employees signed in? Uh, just my Uncle Don. We don't have a security guard at the back door. We use a scanner. Lucy has the log here. Ok, looks like Phil Nardi signed in twice, once at 3:30, once at 5:00. No, I didn't come in at 3:30. Anyone else have a copy of your card? Just security. A wire cutter. It was on a timer. It could have been triggered by anyone. Is it possible this was a prank? Does this look like a prank? Obviously I am being targeted, Ok? The duck killer wants to stop me from uncovering their identity. Any idea who that could have been at 3:30? I don't-I don't know, sorry. Ok, you might wanna get some more security. Of course. And we'll canvass the area and if you notice anything unusual give us a call. Will do. Wait, you're going? Sir, we can't do our job if we stay. Thank you. Uh, I think we should take a break from doing this story. I could always do easy bake ziti. Don. Hi. I got here early so I thought I'd help out. I told him I like chopping. I was a produce manager for years. If I know anything I know carrots. Oh, hi. Hey. So, I hear you hired Don. True. I- I hope I didn't overstep. No. Um, maybe Don could update our inventory for us. We already did inventory. Oh... Oh, what am I saying? That was last week. Well, I will leave you guys to it. Was she carrying a bulletin board? What in the world... Before you say anything I already know you don't approve. Is that Lance? Yeah, I'm pretty sure he's been targeted. If I don't help, Aunt Cassandra, and someone gets hurt I won't be able to live with myself. Ok, before you go saving the world, would you mind asking Don to move his car? He's parked in the customer lot. Maurice already got me to stop him chopping vegetables by the bags full. I don't want to break his spirit. Is that the car from the surveillance tape? Is there a problem? No. No. I made you a snack. I thought you could use a little pick-me-up after that accident this morning. Phil, did you sleep here? Fun fact. Lance has a snoring problem. Lance? Yeah. He spent the night in my apartment. No jokes. I don't know how it happened. He spent all day in the editing room yesterday even though we dropped the duck story. And when I said I was leaving he came with me. He ate my pizza. Sat on my couch and played my video games, and then when I went to bed he was still there. He was scared. I know. I didn't have the heart to send him away. What're you doing here? This is way before your show. Remember the guy who came here yesterday? For Lance's story? Yeah, Lucy's uncle. Did you ever do an interview with him? People are saying all the workers will get laid off as soon as the sale goes through. Is that true? Who told you that? Art Fairweather, is he paying you, too? Do you blame Art Fairweather for causing this strike? No, I blame you, because if you weren't covering this story there wouldn't be a strike. So why are you working today when so many employees are protesting? I don't wanna take sides. You don't support Art Fairweather? I support my customers. That it? Yeah, pretty much. Hmm. You left without telling me? I hope you're not still working on that story. Need I remind you my life is at stake? Hey. What's everybody doing in here? That's the interview that got my Uncle Don fired. I'm sure it's not the only reason he got fired. Wait, that-that came out wrong. Does anyone else smell smoke? Get a fire extinguisher! Ok, I got it! It's not here! There's one in the hall! There's no handle! Help! Hey! It's soundproof! Can you come in the editing room, please? I can't breathe! What is going on in here?! Where's the fire extinguisher? Wait! No, no! The door! Jay Fairweather turned over the books from Fairweather Markets and his personal bank account and I can't find a deposit that size. I don't think it's Jay. So, Olivia Stokes drives a grey Mercedes. But the maid said she was home both nights. Right, but I double checked the security footage and there's a traffic cam at 10th and Main that they must have passed. So I contacted my buddy in traffic. That's not a grey Mercedes. No. That's Don Delaney. We saw him yesterday, at the studio after the light fell. Ok, listen up everyone. Maintenance found a wireless igniter behind the editing suite just like the one on the catwalk. I knew it. Have you called the police? Of course, they're on their way. Is that my sweatshirt? Yes, Philip, because I was cold. Because I don't have any clothing. Because I literally have no place to live. I am being targeted here, people! Actually, I think it's Phil that's being targeted. What, me? Where did you find the duck? Like I told you, it was in my coat pocket hanging on the back on my chair. In the editing suite. In Phil's editing suite. And Phil did those interviews on the strike. Edmond Stokes even accused Phil of making the strike successful. No. I don't think he was accusing me personally. Yes! I knew it didn't make sense. I only did one story and I was very fair. Hey, I was fair. You got a man fired. I doubt he would feel that way. In fact, he might be enraged. Ok, listen. My Uncle Don would never hurt anyone. He's too nice. He and Aunt Carol, they used to babysit me and we used to play all these games... the duck song. Billie, he taught me that song. I- I gotta go back to the restaurant. Take Phil. Clearly it's not safe having you here in the studio. Why did the tomato blush? Because it saw the salad dressing? Yeah. Hey, why did the potatoes argue? I have no idea. They couldn't see eye to eye. Don and Maurice just discovered that they both know a lot of jokes about vegetables. Uh, Don, you remember Phil? Oh, yeah, sure. Yeah, we're old friends. Why is Phil here? Phil's the target, not Lance. I'm pretty sure. So you brought him to the restaurant? Well, Gretchen doesn't want him at the studio. The police say he can't go home. Oh, I'm sorry. Is he sleeping at the restaurant? We can't leave him alone. Ok, I've gotta put my foot down. This has to stop. It is too dangerous. Well, if Don is the killer I don't think I should be here, anyway. You see the way he smiled at me? Did he just say Don? Our Don? We've been buying produce from Don for 15 years. Oh, guys. The police are here. This is a mistake. I don't know why this is happening. Ian. The missing duplicate. Do you recognize this? No. No, I've never seen that before. We're gonna need you to come down to the station. I am so sorry. Why was he working here? He needed a job. He got fired from Fairweather Markets. So you hired him? A murder suspect? Ian, I've known him for years. He was a produce manager. I didn't know he was a suspect. Ok. You know, it's hard not to tell you what to do, but you can't do this. Do what? Involve yourself. You're putting your life at risk. So are you. But I'm a trained police officer. You said you knew what you were getting into. Hey, uh, we should um, we should head back to the station. Nice work on the uh, surveillance footage, by the way. Don't get me wrong, I don't approve, but you know, it's uh, we'd still be waiting on that warrant if it weren't for you. Ok. I guess the D is for Don? Oh, he loved that grocery store. Lucy said it was like his family. You know, none of this would have happened if Edmond hadn't taken over. And then Don, if he hadn't done that interview with Phil, then Art wouldn't have fired him. I guess you really can't trust people, can you? Sometimes you can. Lucy. Oh. The police came to the studio and they remembered Uncle Don was here when the light fell so they asked me if I knew where he was and I had to tell them. This whole thing is my fault. Lucy- No, I brought Uncle Don here. I put everybody in danger. It's not your fault. I um, I found something this morning on the internet. ♪ ... said quack, quack, quack ♪ ♪ And only two little ducks came back, ♪ Should I quit? No, what're you talking about? Finally. I was beginning to wonder if anyone worked here. May I help you? I'm Olivia Stokes. I'm Edmond Stokes' widow, and I just received one of those ridiculous toy ducks. A blue one. When? Someone put it in my mailbox this morning. I gave it to the police, they took my statement, they suggested I go and spend the night in a hotel room. Apparently they don't have the resources to provide surveillance. I want to come on your show. I'm less likely to be killed if people are paying attention. I don't think we're covering the story. Well, you should be. People's lives are at stake. And apparently the police are useless. Excuse me. Lance Tuttle. I'm doing the story, and I know exactly how you feel. Why were you fired? I already told you. Because I kept on working during the strike. Yeah, but others worked. I made a statement on TV. I shouldn't have done it. It was a stupid thing to do. Yeah, we saw the interview. It was pretty harmless. Edmond saw the interview, as well. So he asked me to help him after he got forced out. He wanted me to spy on Art Fairweather. He offered me money. I said no. But Jay saw us talking and he told his father and then Art went to Edmond and Edmond, I guess, said that I was working for him. I don't know why. I mean, maybe to pay me back. Maybe... maybe to get Art upset... And Art fired you? Yes. I can't really say I blame him. So if you said no why were you at the store? The morning Art Fairweather was killed. Look, don't make this hard. Edmond asked me to go. He called me that night. He said there was a camera that he had installed in the store office when he took over. He wanted me to go get it. He said that there was something on it that could get him in trouble and he didn't want Art to find it. So you were working for him. No. No. I already told you. Edmond was a liar. Why would I work for somebody who got me fired? He said that he would tell the police that I planted the camera. That I could go to jail. I said I would take my chances. But then I started thinking, like maybe I could go to jail, you know? Edmond could tell the police anything that he wanted. I mean, he lied to Art and Art believed him over me. After 25 years. I got scared. I had a set of keys so I-I drove to the store but I never went in. As soon as I saw Art's car I drove away. Sounds like you're lying to me. I know how it sounds. That's why I never told you. Uh, we open next week. Something happened. Uh, we'd like to check the office. There's nothing in there. I- I've been cleaning all day. If there was anything strange I would have seen it. All the same, we'd still like to take a look. Yeah. Don't you need a warrant? Uh, would you like us to get a warrant? No, I just um... no. I'm sorry, you caught me off guard. Uh, yes. Of course you can see it. Any time. What was that about? Yeah, that was pretty strange. Probably about this. Just where Don said it would be. Jay, what're you doing here? Tess told me that you have a relationship with that detective. I know the police came to the store today. What were they looking for? You should ask them yourself. The police have been following me for three days. I just worked really hard to get rid of them. They think I killed him. They think I killed my own father! Why would they think that? What did Tess tell you? I'm sorry, you should go. Another twist in an already twisted tale. One of the owners of Fairweather Markets received a death threat yesterday in the form of a toy duck. Olivia Stokes, widow of Edmond Stokes, has generously agreed to share her harrowing experience with us. So Olivia, can you tell us what happened? It was on my step. I opened the door and there it was. A blue duck. How horrible. What went through your mind? Well, clearly the police are incompetent. There's been two owners of this company that have been killed already and I have just been targeted. And they still don't have a single suspect. Didn't you say it was in your mailbox? No. Well, I'm sure Olivia would know since she's the one who found it. Who controls the company now that your husband has passed away? I suppose I do. Thank you for pointing that out. Clearly that is why I received the duck. I suspect that I'll be next. You and your husband separated, didn't you? During the supermarket fight? Because you forced him off the board. My husband made a great many enemies during that fight. In fact, he wrote a large cheque just before he died. The police still have not determined who received the money. Possibly it's that person that's looking to get more money from me. And just two days ago a member of our own news crew received a duck in a failed attempt to keep us from covering the story. Four ducks, few answers. Let's hope the police are watching. These guys sell equipment and host a website. Once a camera is connected it streams to a server. Ok. That's where the recording stops, when you unplugged the camera. It gets better. That's the morning we found Art Fairweather. Is this the same day? Yeah. 5:15. Exactly when Art showed up. 5:00. Tess disarmed the system the first time. That's why she was so nervous when we came to the store. And this is all the footage? That's all they have left on the server. Don said Edmond planted the camera while he was working in the store. There has to be more. Well, the IT guys think that Edmond must have erased it. Maybe this is all he needed. As soon as Edmond saw this footage he must have realized Tess was in the store when her father died. You think he blackmailed her? He might have tried. Used the information to get control of the company again. And then his boat blows up. Let's check her bank account. I don't like to encourage this but shouldn't Olivia be a target? I'm pretty sure she sent herself that duck. I mean, first she said she got it in her mailbox and then it was on her front step. I mean, wouldn't you remember something like that? Why would Olivia send herself a duck? Maybe she thinks she's a suspect. And she wants to divert attention away from herself. I think she's worried. I think I know why. I know the woman who works for Olivia, Esmerelda Sanchez. We used to chat sometimes at the supermarket. She told me that Olivia is a terrible employer, never gives her any time off, no Christmas bonus- Cassandra. Ok, Ok. Esmerelda called me in a panic right after she saw your show. Apparently she told the police that Olivia was home when Edmond was killed but Olivia wasn't home. And she also told me that Edmond was planning to divorce Olivia and Olivia was very worried about losing all her money. What? Why didn't you tell me this? Why do you think? I told her to go straight to the police, which is the appropriate course of action. Maybe we shouldn't go to this funeral. Art Fairweather was our friend. Yeah, I know. I just don't want you to end up like him. My father used to say "life always comes bearing gifts, "even in the worst times we find happiness." Maybe our happiness is all of us here today, remembering how lucky we were to have known him. Ashes to ashes and dust to dust. Go in peace. I know you've been following me. But here? Why don't you just bring me in if you think I did it? Arrest me. Sir, please, just take a deep breath. But you can't arrest me, can you? So leave me alone. Yeah, I will sue. As soon as this is over I promise you will lose your jobs! It was a beautiful service. Poor Tess, losing her father like that, and surrounded by possible murderers. You made a very big mistake on the show yesterday. No one threatens me and gets away with it. I only see one person making threats. Who are you? Aunt Cassandra, you wanted to sign that guestbook, right? I'll meet you at the car. Ok. Listen, I'm really sorry if I've upset you. Don't waste your breath. I've watched you. I've seen your little crusades. You're a fool. You have no idea who you're dealing with. Hi. Everything Ok? Yeah, everything's fine. Are you sure? Positive. Well, it's good to see you again. It's good to see you, too. Are you two in a fight? Look, I know she oversteps but at the end of the day she's actually been pretty helpful. Plus, I think she's good for you. Truth be told you can be a little uptight. What're you doing here? I thought you were the duck killer. Isn't this your day off? I needed to think. Wow. This is how your mind works, huh? Olivia was standing by the grave and then she came up to me. She didn't have a chance to go to my car. I was watching her the whole time. Wait, why are we talking about Olivia? I think she might be the killer. Seriously? Edmond was divorcing her, she was about to lose a lot of money. Yeah, but why would she come after me? I didn't even interview her. Maybe she just wanted you to stay away from the story. But I'm having a hard time picturing her crawling around a catwalk or blowing up a boat. She probably hired somebody. People like that don't do their own dirty work. Phil. What-what-what-what did I say? When Olivia came on the show she said that Edmond made a lot of enemies during that supermarket fight, and that he just cut a big cheque to someone. A cheque police haven't been able to track yet. Maybe Edmond was being blackmailed. But a blackmailer wouldn't kill Edmond. Right. Right. Because then they would stop getting money. What if Edmond hired someone to kill Art, Olivia figured out who it was, and then she blackmailed the killer? And got them to kill Edmond. And then that's who left that duck in my car. Wait, wait. What? Is that what I think it is? You need to take this to the police. Oh, I will. As soon as I figure out who's working with Olivia. Why don't I like the sounds of that? Wait, what're you writing? Is that Olivia's address? Don't worry, I won't go inside. I'm coming with you. You can't. Why? There's only two of us and one killer. If we don't stay together we're harder to track. Hello? It's Billie Blessings. Don't hang up. I know you sent yourself that duck. It's just a matter of time before the police figure it out. You're already a suspect. They'll probably be a lot nicer to you and more understanding if you just tell them who's helping you. Are you trying to give me a heart attack? What're you doing here? Did you follow me? Actually, no. Watching Olivia. She was lying about that duck. Yeah, she's definitely lying. I just called her. I might have implied that I know she's the killer. Which is why you're out here. Waiting to see what she does next. You wanna wait with me? Why are you here? Olivia's maid came to us after you did the show. Nice work, by the way. She retracted her statement about Olivia's alibi. She lied because she was afraid of getting fired. Edmond filed for divorce. How do you do this? Well, I had planned on telling you but Don got arrested and then we kinda fell off track. Yeah. Do you think I'm uptight? No. Not at all. I just... I don't want anything to happen to you. I know. I used to wait up all night when my dad was on duty. I couldn't sleep until he got home. I used to cook to distract myself. I bet you came up with some helpful sayings. No, but I did learn how to make a mean pie crust. Maybe you should show me. I would love that. Jay? Get in. What? What do you know? Jay said you found something at the store. What? Tess was at the store the morning their father got killed. That's not possible. And Tess, too? I'm just gonna say it. This is making me a little uncomfortable. It's like Jack the Ripper. Except only two people have gotten killed. You're-you're right. That's true. Nobody's been killed, not since Edmond. Nobody's even gotten hurt. Why? Well, it hasn't exactly been a walk in the park. I don't think the person who did this is trying to kill people. I think they just wanna make people afraid. Why? I don't know. Maybe to cause a distraction. Wait, where are you going? To talk to Tess. Right here. Sit down. Who are all these people? It's the duck story. We've been getting calls all morning. People playing practical jokes, accusing each other... my kids can't stop singing the song, it's driving me crazy. Huh. This group was a lot more talkative last night. Tess? I thought you'd arrest me right after you found that camera. Why were you in the store, Tess, the morning your father died? Edmond called. He woke me up. He said that he left a picture at the office. He said as soon as my father saw it he'd know that we had been working together. So I went to get it, only there was no picture. Or, if there was, I never found it. My father came in while I was there. I left through the back door. He never saw me. He was alive when I left. I swear. Were you working with Edmond? We checked your bank account again this morning. We know you deposited the cheque. The stores weren't doing well. Our father had always given most of the profits to the workers and he kept prices low. That's why people loved him. But we didn't have any money to make improvements and over time that takes a toll. Tess and I were afraid the company might close. Right after Edmond inherited the company, said he wanted to sell, said he'd had enough of our family, which we knew was true, but he said the buyers wanted to keep everything the same. Our father could keep working. They just wanted to make the improvements. We believed him. Plus, he gave you $100,000. Tess told you. We didn't take it for ourselves we took it for the stores. We wanted to save the stores. As soon as Edmond fired our father we knew we'd been tricked. I gave the money back, I went straight to the buyers, I told them that Edmond was a cheat and a liar and they shouldn't be getting into business with him. Then what happened? Edmond got angry. He started calling. Threatening to tell our father that we had betrayed him. You must have been worried. Our father knew we loved him. It wouldn't have mattered what Edmond said. What about the money? We gave the money back. Then why is it still in your personal banking account? Edmond never- -cashed the cheque. Canard rouge, red duck. Here's what I think happened. You went to the store that morning. Your father surprised you. You guys had a fight. Maybe about you and Jay working for Edmond. No. Then something went wrong, maybe it was an accident. No. But you tried to cover it up, make it look like Edmond did it. No. But Edmond had a recording on you, tried to blackmail you, so you killed him. Or maybe Olivia knew about the recording and threatened to stay quiet if you and Jay took care of Edmond. That's not what happened. But you were working with her. Olivia called us last night. She said the police were starting to suspect her. She wanted us to tell you that Don Delaney threatened my father and then she would say that Edmond hired Don to kill my father and that way Don would go to jail, not us. Why would you work with her knowing that she might have killed your father? She found the cheque that we gave Edmond. She said if we didn't help she would give it to the police. Ian, it's me. I'm at the store. I just found a picture of Tess and Edmond on his boat. I checked and he bought the boat right after his father died. He changed the name. You're not gonna believe this. Edmond's boat used to be called the Red Duck. I think he might still be alive. There's no point in running, both doors are locked, and security being a high priority these days, keyed deadbolts. You shouldn't have come here. I tried to warn you. I gave you a duck to keep you away. What're you gonna do? I haven't decided yet. I never wanted to kill you. The only person I wanted to kill was Art. Don't do that! Do what? Sneak up on people! This isn't a game. I'm not trying to be funny in spite of what everyone thinks. What're you doing here? Hiding. That death threat? I need a place to stay. Where's Billie? She didn't come into work today. What do you mean, she didn't come into work today? We have a show that starts in half an hour. She's not even answering her phone. She got a duck. What? I think I might know where she is. Why are you doing this? Why don't you tell me? You want Tess and Jay to go to jail for their father's murder. I knew it. You were wasted on the cooking show. That's why you put that picture in the office, why you told Art about that cheque. You needed everyone to think that you were working with them so they would have motive. They were working with me. I don't believe that. Not the way you wanted. They loved their father. They would never betray him. Art Fairweather took everything away from me. My wife, my father, my life. So you're making them all pay? Tess and Jay and Olivia just for taking his side? So they'd know what it feels like when the world turns against you. Your father never loved you, did he? That's not gonna help you! You think they did it? No. I think they made a mistake trusting Edmond. They really loved their father. Why didn't Edmond take that money? They betrayed him. He wouldn't want them to keep it. Edmond was moving them all around like puppets. You know we never found Edmond Stokes' body. You think he's still alive? Hey, Cassandra. I'm on my way. Billie's missing. I need cars at Tess Fairweather's house. Anyone that's in the vicinity. It's the guy's your interviewing. All the alerts are from the same number. We just got a call from the alarm company. Someone tripped the panic-button at Fairweather Market. I could do this all day, I don't have any appointments. No one's coming for you. Your friends are all at the police station being interrogated. It's locked. No, no, no! No. No. He's in the freezer. You heard her, let's go! It's Ok. You're Ok. So what do you think? I think it looks perfect. Well, don't just stand there, we have fresh strawberries! I'll be right there. Trust me, they won't last long. Billie. Sorry I'm late. It was worth the wait. Edmond pleaded guilty. It seemed like he actually enjoyed telling us. Yeah, he wants people to know. That's why he sent those ducks. He originally planned to give those five ducks to the five owners of the company. Himself, Art, Olivia, Tess and Jay. That way he could terrorize them, make them all look guilty. Turn them against each other. Destroy the company just like Jay said. Yeah, Edmond moved most of his money into off-shore accounts so he could leave the country when somebody was arrested, whether it was Tess or Olivia or Jay. Best case scenario all three of them. Yeah, I can understand why Edmond would want to hurt Tess, Jay, or Olivia, but why Don? Well, Edmond needed us to find that spy camera so he sent Don to go get it, only Don never went inside. So Edmond had to make Don look like a suspect so he could tell you about the camera? That's why he gave Phil the duck. And he gave one to Olivia, too? Uh, no. He was planning on it but Olivia gave herself one before he had a chance to. I knew it. Edmond, he made that video with all of the faces on it, didn't he? Yeah, he had a lot of time on his hands on that boat alone watching that security camera. Said it was like playing chess. I bet his father never played chess with him. Ok, don't go feeling sorry for him. There's much better ways to get attention. Oh, really? I'm looking forward to a demonstration. Well, I was thinking we'd start with a picnic. I heard Fairweather Markets has some good wine. And then if we had some time we can go dancing. How about we start with the dancing? 'Cause you know what they say. Life is short. It is short, isn't it? Ian. What can I say? Sometimes you gotta take a risk. I couldn't agree more.
