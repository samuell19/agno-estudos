[heavy breathing] [laughter] MAN: Keep your eyes on the road. WOMAN: [inaudible] MAN: Oh. WOMAN: Oh. MAN: Hey, yes. WOMAN: [panting] REPORTER [RADIO]: And the city board says another girl has been found dead in the Hollywood Hills. The girl, the second in only one week, has been identified as a student from Holy Trinity College. No other information has been released. The police still have no leads and are advising all women to take extra precautions until the killer is found. WOMAN: [laughing] REPORTER [RADIO]: In other news, astronomers all over the world eagerly await the full lunar eclipse, the first in 66 years. The last eclipse occurred in 1928. [sirens] Jesus Christ, Garner. If you're sick, go to the hospital. It's that damn Mexican food. I can't do anything about it. Oh, man. I need a drink Here. We got a cause of death? No. They can't figure it out. Oh yeah, she's warm. Like a doughnut straight out of the oven, huh? Jesus Garner. Hey, we can still smell the perfume. Do we have an ID? Her name's Peggy Malone. Age, 27. Says she's got blue eyes. Not a bad looker, huh? Jesus Christ, Gardner. The poor girl is dead and you think she's worth a roll in the hay. You're fucking disgusting, you know that? Oh shit. I don't need this. GARNER: Hey, captain. How you doing? Looks like she's in a trance. Just like the other two, sir. No signs of penetration. No visible wounds. Coroner says she's been embalmed. This all you two morons can figure out? Jesus Christ. This makes number three, Lutz. If there's a number four, you're going to be picking your dick while you're directing traffic. So you better get your head out of your fat ass and solve this case. It's a goddamn miracle the press hasn't gone public with this. And you-- wipe that shit eating grin of your face. Captain, we are making progress. We're pursuing numerous leads and we believe that-- Leads? Arrest somebody. Don't give me this Marianne shit about, we've got numerous leads. Jesus, I can turn on the television and hear that bullshit. I wouldn't want to be a woman in this town with cops like you jerking off dropping doughnuts into your fat traps and doubling for an episode of "Laverne and Shirley" while some Psycho Sid son of a bitch is out there playing Russian Roulette with my mortality. If I get woken up in the middle of the night with another one of these calls, you are off the case. I don't get it. What? "Laverne and Shirley" was not a bad show. Shut up, Garner. Just shut up. Hey, you all right, man? Can I get yo anything else? What do you have in mind? That'll be $1.68. Keep the change. When was the last time you saw an optometrist. I don't see [inaudible] [inaudible] talking to you man. Hold up. I really like Country-Western. How about you? Me too. Can I buy you a shake or something? No thanks, I'm waiting for someone. Hm, lucky someone. My name's Jonathan. What's others? Mary. Like the virgin. Excuse me. This is starting to give me a headache. Nada. Four weeks of this and nothing to show for it. Betty? What? Where are those new files on cause of death unknown? Right here. Put them on my desk, will you? Anything else I can get for you? Anymore doughnuts? It's going to be a long night. What am I, your secretary? Thanks, hun. Garner. Look at this, from San Francisco. Victim found with no visible wounds. Cause of death unknown, time of death unknown. Body found embalmed, only a small gold cross found around her neck. We got a link here. Betty. BETTY: What? Give this cop from San Francisco a call. Mmm. We got a link here. Well, it's about time. Oh, and Betty. What? I think you should stop wearing that cross around your neck. It was my grandmother's. I never take it off. Hey, just looking out for you. I don't want to be sitting here looking at your picture next week. Wonder what that looks like, huh? Your date isn't very punctual. He must have forgot. How could someone forget a girl like you? I would never forget a girl like you. You wouldn't? No. I feel like a drink. What do you say? I have a drink. No, no, I mean a real drink-- something with a little more kick to it. Have you ever had a screaming orgasm? What? Well, it's a drink. Oh, I don't think alcohol. Who said it was a drink? Christ, if It's not some psycho that kills me, it'll be your cigarette smoke. Hey, I'm under a lot of pressure here, all right? Let's put out an APB. An APB? Hm. On who? Well, we have that description from that witness, no? You call this sorry piece of shit a description? Six foot, muscular, cute ass? That's half the guys in this city. All right, well, we have to do something to please the captain. Yeah, and blowing smoke up our asses ain't it. Some woman out there's going to be this guy's next victim. And what are we doing about it? Sorry. Ow! Sorry. I owe you one. Well, thanks for walking me home. Sure. You live here alone? Mm-hm. Must get kind of scary living here by yourself. Or at least lonely. Do you want to come in? Yeah. Why so nervous? Uh, look, Mister. What did you say your name was? Jonathan. Jonathan, I hardly know you. OK. You're right, I'm sorry. I just find myself very attracted to you. Your beauty and your charm. How sweet. Can I get you something to drink? Coffee? Tea? Maybe something cold. Cool me off. OK. OK, there's cranberry juice, ginger ale, chocolate milk, tomato juice? You have a beer? No. Of course you don't. I'll have tomato juice. Pretend it's a Bloody Mary. WOMAN: [moan] MARY: [moan] Jesus, Garner. Which side are you on? Man, you're like a bull in a china shop. Look at this. I think you found something, boy-o. And everybody thinks you're stupid. Betty! MARY: [moan] What? LUTZ: Go down to the morgue Tell the coroner we need tight shots on every inch of Peggy Malone's body, ASAP. The morgue? Go down to the newsstand. They got pictures of live ones. Hey, and pick us up some doughnuts on the way back-- fresh ones, huh? Oh, if you have time. You are both disgusting pigs. You know that. Just doing our jobs. Well, you don't have to enjoy it so much. We got ourselves a genuine psycho here. Jesus. Ritual killings, man. I think we need some professional help on this one. Well, it works for me, man. I'm open to anything at this point. Betty, come here. Yeah. You ever get a hold of that cop in San Francisco. No, but somebody else did. What do you mean? Killed. Murdered. Jesus. Yeah. Look, we need files on every single expert in the occult who's ever stepped foot in this place. That's a lot of files. Then you better get on it ASAP. Whatever happened to good old fashioned murder, huh? This supernatural mumbo jumbo gives me the creeps. Really. Reminds me of that scary TV series in the '60s. There's this pool hustler guy who runs into this wacko. They get this bet going on. He doesn't realize he's playing the devil in disguise. What's your point? It was a great episode. It was. I think she was a virgin. Was. You idiot. You screwed her? You know I can't touch any of them. Why do you think I need you so badly, Cat? More. [moaning] Jesus. Time to wake up and smell the coffee. If only you'd make it for us. Now, here's a list of all the most recent cases having to do with the occult and here's a list of people involved. Look at all these people. This is going to take forever. Well, if I were you, I'd start with this guy over here on the bottom-- Will Spanner. Will Spanner, divorce lawyer. Sounds like a bad TV series. What the hell's a divorce lawyer going to know about the occult? Don't you ever read the papers? This guy Spanner's helped the department out with the occult before. Word is his father was some kind of high ranking devil worshipper. Whoa. He sounds like our best bet. We find him, he finds our man, and we get all the credit. Get me everything you can on this guy. I'll pay him a visit. What? Please? Thank you? You're welcome. OK, look. I want you to round up all these loonies. Bring them to the blue room tomorrow. Why the blue room? Because I want this Spanner guy to watch the questioning from behind the mirror. Tell us what we don't see. And I suppose I have to pick him up too? No. You and I will pay him a visit tomorrow morning at his home. I love getting lawyers out of bed. Speaking of bed, where's Betty? I heard that. We're going home, out together. You want to join me? Stick with your hand tonight, Garner. Only if you do the same, baby. Come on, let's get out of here. [inaudible] [gasp] What's wrong? Nothing, I'm OK. [knocking] Who the hell is that? [knocking] It's going to be a great weekend. Mm-hm. First in the shower. [knocking] [knocking] [knocking] Garner. Uh, Mr. Spanner? SPANNER: Yeah. GARNER: Mr. Will Spanner. What do you want? LAPD, homicide. We'd like to ask you a few questions. I'd like to see your IDs. All right, come on in. Thanks. Thank. Sorry. So you want to tell me what this is all about? Well, we'd prefer to do this downtown, Mr. Spanner. You telling me me you're under arrest? Not at all. Just want to ask you some questions. About what? Well, you've heard about the murders, haven't you? The women? -Yeah? So what's that got to do with me? Our records show that you have some special knowledge of the occult. And we have reason to believe that our suspect is killing these women for some ritualistic purpose. And we think you might be able to help us find our suspect. Guys, I'm a divorce lawyer. I deal with dead marriages, not dead women. Ha, that's funny. It would mean a great deal to the department, Mr. Spanner. We have no leads, nothing. We're hanging at the end of a rope here. Innocent women are being murdered. You could help us save the next victim. Good book. Put that back. Lutz here. COP [RADIO]: Unit 238. Go ahead. COP [RADIO]: We just found another girl-- Whitely Heights. LUTZ: Jesus Christ. COP [RADIO]: We're going to need you down at the morgue immediately. We'll be right there. It's number four. You see what I mean? Why don't you come down with us? Maybe you'll see something we don't. All right, let me get dressed. So what do you think? About what? I was just asking. You're in a big hurry. Who is it? It's the police. Making house calls at 7 AM? They think I can help in their investigation, honey. What investigation? Will? -I don't know. I'll know more later. Will, we had plans for today. I know, sweetheart. I'm sorry. We'll do it next weekend. I promise. Now, I got to go. WOMAN: Will. SPANNER: Yeah. We can't go through this again. I know. Come here. [clears throat] Catch a look at her crotch? I haven't gotten that far yet, but I'm sure that what's down there won't surprise me, Garner. No, no, no. I'm not talking about that. Take a look at that. That mean anything to you, counselor? Counselor? Counselor, are you all right? [moaning] She's marked for sacrifice. Sacrifice to who? Satan. Satan. The Satan? Mr.-- Mr. Goober. That is pronounced joo-bear. Mr. Jew Bear, can you tell me the significance of these markings here? Does it mean anything supernatural? Well? [speaking french] What does it mean? Well, it reminds me of a necklace my mother used to wear before the [inaudible] marched into Vichy. What? --[speaking french] I'd given her this necklace. But then, the Germans, they came in and they took everything. they were [speaking french] Mister-- Mr. G? Stick to the subject, OK? We're not hear to discuss your family history, all right? So you getting anything from this guy? No, this guy's a fruit cakes. Get rid of him. --significance of these markings here. It is the symbol of our lord almighty's love for all those who think of him as the only savior. Mister-- Mr. G? This is a very important police investigation. And I must tell you that after listening to you now and all the other fruit cake I've listened to today, I think you're full of shit. You know, what gives you the authority to be spouting off this crap? It says here you own a small fortune telling shop at Silver Lake. Now, why the hell should I believe anything you have to say, pal? Because, monsieur, I am the collected for our lord almighty. Is that right? Oui. At this moment, I am preparing for the coming of our lord. Oh? Oh, when is that? A week from this Tuesday around dinner time. Around dinner time. He's going to be very hungry from his journey. [inaudible]. OK, pal. We have everything we need from you. Thanks Merci, officer. Our lord will look very favorably upon you. Yeah, whatever you say. How you like that one, counselor? You see this, counselor? Belongs to my wife. This belonged to the deceased. What can you tell us about her? She was a beautiful, beautiful, beautiful pretty girl. Blonde, blue eyes. Oh she always want to be a cheer leader. Oh, but she never make it to the first cut. That is when she became-- when she became oh lord, religious. Right. She died a painful death. Oh, I can feel her suffocating. No, she was stabbed in the heart. No, the throat. You sure about this? Fuck you. You asked me here. I'm doing you a favor. Don't you call me a liar. I'll break your fucking neck! Hey, watch your language, asshole. This is a police station. I'm kind of nervous. I've never been inside a police station before. So-- Uh huh. What can you tell us about the deceased? Oh, oh, uh, yes. She-- she was a fucking nympho, man. I mean, this girl enjoyed it very-- if you know what I mean. What do you mean? I mean, this girl came before she went if you get my drift. Hey, look. Do you think you can give me the panties? Because I can tell you a lot more if you give me the panties. You're disgusting. Get the hell out of here. Wait, just give me a few more minutes. She was a big girl. What do you mean big? Big boobs. Big boobies. She had big nipples. I think that's from having so many children. What can you tell us about the killer? --[speaking spanish] your killer-- your killer used to work at a taco stand in El Segundo. And before that-- before that, he worked at a service station in Paquime. Madre-- and before that-- LUTZ: Yeah, thanks for the job history. We just want to know what kind of criminal mind we're dealing with here. We're dealing with a bipolar affective personality-- a man who seeks pious women as a way to resolve his own religious repression dating as far back as early childhood Sunday school classes where he was forced to do things, awful things, which we must not speak of in this room. Well, that's why you're here, pal-- to speak. So can you help us out? Hello? Can you help us out? OK, that's about all for today. Thanks. Thank you. Thanks. Hey, sleeping beauty. This is a big fucking waste of time and it's really starting to piss me off. How many have we got left? Just one. Well, finally, we're coming to an end. How are you doing counselor? How much longer do I need to be here? What, you're not having a good time? Hey, Garner. Counselor here's not having a good time. Look, you've got me up early on a Sunday morning. Now you got me watching the cast of "One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest"? Hey, you got to do something better than this. Hey, relax. Just do your thing and feel that rhythm of yours and tell us which one of these crackpots is talking sense. We've got one more left. So stop complaining and cut us a little slack here, all right? All right, but I need to make a phone call. Pay phone in the hallway. Counselor, don't disappear on us, OK? Please, don't stare. That mean anything to you? Who does it belong to? Your wife? Don't be smart. Surely you're not suggesting that I sit here and lie to you. Are you, officer? Take a look at this photograph. Does that mean anything to you? Well? Does it mean anything to you? I regret to say that it does not. Mr. Savante-- [woman crying] --these markings mean nothing to you? I thought you were some kind of expert in the supernatural. I own a small curio shop. I deal in ancient artifacts. I hardly see how that qualifies me as some expert on the supernatural. Well, what the hell are you doing here wasting your time? You called me. Frankly, I have no idea. I apologize. You can-- you can leave. Thank you. Oh, and good luck. So what did you think of that wacko, counselor? Arrest him. Him? Yeah, he's your man. OK, Spanner. I tell you what we'll do. We'll check his alibi, OK? Why don't you go home and spend some time with that pretty little girl of yours and put your thinking cap on and look forward to seeing us tomorrow, OK? Great. Savante, eh? Yeah. WOMAN; I was just on the phone with the station. Thanks for calling. I'm sorry, honey. I couldn't get to a phone. Do you mind telling me what's going on? The police seem to think their serial killer is involved with the occult. They want me to help find him. Come on-- stay out of it, Will. I can't stay out of it. They won't let me stay out of it. Tell me something. Do you have some sort of crazy death wish? Nope, I don't. But innocent women are being murdered and I just can't stand by and watch it happen. Just forget it. I'll be all right. They can't give me this time. They can always get you, Will. You wanted to see me. Come here, my dear. I encountered a most interesting young man today-- Will Spanner. Because that name mean anything to you? Of course. He was once one of us. But he rejected the path of our lord. I believe that he could be a thorn in our side, so to speak. I want you to pluck him. So to speak? Yes. He could be a great service to us with his powers. I suspect that he is in contact with our virgin sacrifice. And he's protecting her from us. Bring him back. Bring him back to us the best way you know how. In some cultures, they consider the egg to symbolize the human soul. I think of Mr. Spanner as an egg, my dear. Drive. Danny, I can't. Of course I still love you. I got to call you back. Any messages? No. But there's somebody waiting for you. Who is it? Mrs. Rehnquist. Well, where is she? In your office. What is she doing in my office? Um, well, I didn't know when you were going to be back. And she was so insistent. I thought you knew her. [clears throat] Excuse me, Mrs. Rehnquist. What can I do for you? That's a loaded question. For me, a divorce. What can I do for you? Look, I'm very busy here. I know you are. That's why I've chosen you to represent me. My husband left me six months ago and I'd like to finalize the divorce as soon as possible so I can get on with my life. Of course. My husband thinks that I've been promiscuous. And he's trying to screw me out of my money. I simply want what's mine. Well, have you been promiscuous? Who wants to know? I do. I need to know the facts if I decide to represent you. If you decide to represent me? A lawyer who plays hard to get. That's a new one. Maybe we should test my promiscuity. No, I don't think so. Besides, it would be bad for your case. Well, you know what they say. There are some women whose fidelities are the only link they have with their husbands. If you put a tail on him, you'll see he's no different than me. If you can prove it, then I'll get the settlement I deserve. That's him, the bastard. He's a handsome man. I see better. Well, are you going to represent me? I'll make it worth your while, Will. All right, my fee is $300. An hour. Fine. You've made the right decision. OK, you can see my secretary on the way out, fill out the proper paperwork, Mrs. Rehnquist. My husband bar tends at The Black Cat. I think he's having an affair with one of the dancers there. I'll see you soon, Will. Good to see you. [inaudible]. Can I get you a drink? I'll have a scotch, please. Thanks. She's quite a looker, isn't she? You really think so? You don't? Well, I suppose. I've been fucking her for the last year. Oh? Guess by now I'm getting kind of bored, you know what I mean? Oh, sure. Oh, so you've been there too, I take it. No, no I haven't been there. But if you're interested, I'm sure I can introduce you. Might do you some good. Jesus Christ, Spanner. If you can't hold your alcohol, don't fucking drinking, huh? I should have your ass arrested. You're a lawyer, not an investigator. What the fuck you doing snooping around here, anyway? You're going to screw up this entire investigation. What are you talking about? I was paid by a client to tail her husband. LUTZ: What? Yeah. Oh, and he just so happened to be hanging at The Black Cat, right? -He's the bartender. Is there something strange about that? Strange? I'll tell you strange, pal. It just so happens that our friend Savante owns The Black Cat. A little too coincidental, don't you think? How easily the flesh is corrupted. Cat will enjoy this conquest. You got to arrest him. We can't. We've got nothing on him. Then why did you call me? You know what? Go fuck yourself. Don't say a word. Shit. REPORTER [RADIO]: Another chapter in this tragic tale-- a fourth woman has been murdered. The police are still baffled, as no leads have been found. Kelly? Sorry about yesterday. SPANNER: It's OK. Think I can make it up to you? I think you can. What the hell's wrong with you? SPANNER: I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. And now, my child, prepare your body for our lord Satan. [scream] You have failed me once again. Dispose of her. And if you fail me once more, I will dispose of yo. You morons seen the morning paper? What? What? Well, the mayor has seen the morning paper. And he has been on the phone to me to find out why this case hasn't been solved We're right on top of it. Right on top of it? It's been a month. You don't even have anybody under arrest. You don't even have any fucking suspects. We've been working hard on this case. It hasn't been an easy case, Captain. You're right. I mean, Well, I don't care about how hard you're working. I want to see results. Well, we have some results. We do have results. That's it, OK? You guys are off the case. Just take a look at our report. I don't want to look at your fucking report. Simon and Meikiwitz are taking over this case. Turn over your file to them ASAP. But Captain-- That is all. Who the fuck are you? Hey, wait a second. Hey, we're one step away from uncovering something her,e guys. You can't just drop it. Spanner, we're off the case. So are you, pal. Yeah, but we're so close. Close but no cigar. You ever hear that one? Next time, huh? Yeah. You think it's that nutso Savante, don't you? Yes, I do. Well, unfortunately, we can't go around locking people up just because they give you the creeps. All right, Lutz. I've tried to help. You're making a big mistake. How many more bodies have to show up before you realize what the hell's going on? Hey, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold on. Look, obviously I'm just desperate enough to go along with you on this one. I want to solve this thing just as bad as you do, Spanner. You can count on me. All right? You have been a great disappointment to me, my darling Cat. The eclipse draws near and yet you have failed to find the proper sacrifice. What am I to do with you? You must trust me. I only need more time. Time? There is no more time. Satan must have his virgin mistress before the eclipse. Only then will the forces of hell be unleashed to lead the way to the apocalypse. That only gives us until tomorrow night. Perhaps I have underestimated you, my dear. As I said before, Mr. Spanner holds the key to our sacrifice. And yet you have been most soft with him. Careless, too. Give me one more chance. I promise I won't disappoint you. What are you doing? Hi. Don't you make appointments? I was in the neighborhood. Oh, right. Dressed like that? Like what? I'm wearing a simple red dress. Yeah. Actually, I'm glad you dropped by, Mrs. Rehnquist. Oh? SPANNER: I paid a visit to your husband last night. And? And I feel there are some things you're not telling me. There's a lot I'm not telling you. It's a matter of asking the right questions. Here's a question. What's the connection between your husband and Charles Savante? Savante? Savante. I'm drawing a blank. Look, Mrs. Rehnquist. I've had one day to follow up on your case. I don't work at the speed of light. I bet you work extremely fast under the proper circumstances. Stop that, Mrs. Rehnquist. Stop what? This is not going to help your case. It helps more than you know. [laughing] Mr. Spanner-- Mr. Spanner, are you all right? How long have you been standing there? A few minutes. That must've been quite a day dream. You were telling me what you got on my husband. Right. You were right. He did admit to having an affair with a dancer. Well, move on it. That's what I'm paying you for I'm moving as fast as I can, Mrs. Rehnquist. I've just been a bit tied up. Hm, that's a thought. SECRETARY [INTERCOM]: Mr. Spanner, Kelly's on the line. Tell her I'll be right with her. You have to go. But we have more to talk about. Then make an appointment. Who's Kelly? That's none of your concern. But it is my concern. Hi, honey. KELLY [INTERCOM]: What's wrong? You OK? -No, nothing. KELLY [INTERCOM]: Will-- Nothing, I'm just tired. KELLY [INTERCOM]: Are we still on for a movie? No, I can't do that tonight. KELLY [INTERCOM]: Why not? No, I've got too much work to do. KELLY [INTERCOM]: I love you. All right, I love you too. Bye. -Diane. -Oh. What's wrong? Mr. Spanner, I'm sorry. I'll get to that letter immediately. I'm not worried about the letter. I'm worried about you. Oh Mr. Spanner, you're such a good person. Next to God, I think you're the nicest person in the whole world. I don't know about that. So you going to leave me in suspense or what? Oh, it's this guy. I mean, he's really kind. He's intelligent. He's honest. I think I really love him. So what's the problem? He's just going too fast, you know what I mean? I don't know, I just finished school. I just started this new job. I'm just not ready to go so fast. Diane, I think it'll work itself out. Thank you, Mr. Spanner. Thank you. [ringing] Mr. Spanner's office. REHNQUIST [PHONE]: This is John Rehnquist. One moment. It's Mr. Rehnquist. What? Yeah. Hello? REHNQUIST [PHONE]: Is this Will Spanner? Yes, this is he. REHNQUIST [PHONE]: So are you going to tell me what's going on? No, I'm not at liberty to talk about your wife's case, Mr. Rehnquist. REHNQUIST [PHONE]: Would you change your mind if I mentioned a settlement? What kind of settlement are you talking about? REHNQUIST [PHONE]: Not on the phone. I work at The Black Cat. All right, I'll see you there in an hour. Might I suggest an extremely dry vodka martini straight up with an olive? On the house, of course. Good evening, Mr. Spanner. So very nice to see the face from behind the glass. Charles Savante. What the hell are you doing here? I am the owner of this establishment. The question is, what are you doing here? I like an occasional drink after work. Oh, I didn't realize that you worked so late. Oh, I forget. You attorneys don't work regular set shifts, do you? That's right. We don't follow a time clock. Good for you. It's almost a rather barbaric notion, don't you think? Punch in, punch out-- almost inhuman. Almost. So tell me the truth, Mr. Spanner. What are you doing here? Looking for me? No. Actually, I'm here on business with a client. Why hear, of all places? It's confidential. I'd prefer not to talk about it anymore. Something tells me otherwise. Mmm? What's that? Oh, Let's just say that I'm psychic. Are you psychic, Mr. Spanner? Lights are on. She must be home. Wish me luck. Luck. Where's the syringe? You have it. It's not in here. God damn it. It's in my purse. I left it at Spanner's office. You what? You can be so stupid-- Shut up! Just go make sure she doesn't leave. I'll go get it. Go on! Well, I'm sorry. But if you can't respect the way I feel about this, then maybe we should break up. OK, fine. Then maybe we should break up. I forgot my purse. Oh, I have it, Mrs. Rehnquist. You never left your number. I would've called you. What an exquisite ring. Thank you. I don't believe I've ever seen one quite like it. Ah, yeah, it's my graduation ring. I just graduated from Sacred Heart. You don't say? Have you kept all of your vows? Excuse me. The vows of the church. There are so few of us who are strong enough not to break them. Yeah, well, my boyfriend sure wishes I would break one of those vows, if you know what I mean. I think I do, my dear. I think I do. You know, I don't believe in any of that shit. Psychic, supernatural, extraterrestrial, astrological, I don't believe any of it. Oh, but Will. That's so cynical and so untrue. Surely you realize that there are certain people who are chosen to possess such abilities. You know, I got to get going. Does this subject make you uncomfortable? No, you make me uncomfortable. Tell me, Mr. Spanner. Have you ever used any of your powers? I don't know what you're talking about. Come, come, Mr. Spanner. I am an informed citizen. I do read the papers. I seem to recall some articles from some time ago involving you with activities of the supernatural, so to speak. Surely you don't believe everything you read in the papers. Not everything. But some things-- I seem to recall these articles being buried in the back of the second section. I wonder how you managed that. You know, I'd say this was a pleasure if it were. If I were you, I'd hurry home, Mr. Spanner. REPORTER [RADIO]: In other news, a fifth girl has been found murdered in the Hollywood Hills. The police believe the killings are religiously motivated and are warning all women to lock their doors and stay inside. And tonight, astronomers all over the world will be out in full force as the lunar eclipse approaches. You all right, honey? All right. MAN: Shit. WOMAN: What happened to your hand? MAN: She stabbed me with a pair of fucking scissors. WOMAN: Ouch! MAN: Not funny. Guess what? That wasn't our girl. I've got our girl. She's in the trunk-- Spanner's secretary fresh out of convent school. You're kidding. Let's hope she kept her vows. Oh, my poor baby. What's wrong? Call Lutz and tell him to meet me at my office. Don't go. Lock these doors and don't let anybody in, all right? We have to get moving. There's no more time to waste. Well, I'm sorry. I just wanted to relieve some of this tension. Of course you did, and I rather enjoyed it. But we have to get going. I came as fast as I could. What the hell happened here? Well, let's just say the unfaithful husband I've been tailing is also the same psycho you're looking for. Jesus. And he works for a woman who calls herself Rehnquist. Yeah, my guess is they're both working for Savante. Are you sure about this? Lutz, they've taken my secretary. Christ. I bet they're at The Black Cat. No. They've got to be at the highest point of the city. They've-- they've got to be as close to the moon as possible. Then there's only one place they could be. She's rather sultry for a virgin. I've spent my miserable life with mortals. Tonight, I shall serve at the side of Satan. She is the one. Oh man, the only eclipse in my lifetime and I got to be on duty. [scream] You hear that? Let's separate. I'll go this way. You have been of great service to me. I no longer need your service. Our master will be so pleased. We'll finally have a mistress worthy of his esteem. Prepare the sacrifice. And do not disturb me. I really wouldn't do that if I were you, Mrs. Rehnquist. Besides, it may just hurt your case. Hello, William. It's a little late for heroics, don't you think? Get out of my way. Get out of my way. Oh, what are you going to do? Tear my pretty head off my pretty shoulders? That's a thought. Now you sound like one of us. You are one of us, Will. You can't fight the prince of darkness. It'll always be stronger than you. Let it in, darling. Let it in. You're getting excited, Mr. Spanner. The thought of killing you does that to me. I don't think so. I think your body's saying yes and your mind is saying no. I always listen to my body, Will. It makes for a much better time. Speak for yourself. I speak for both of us, Will. We're both the same. Our bodies belong to Satan forever. Freeze! I can't believe I got lost in the woods. I can. DIANE: Mr. Spanner? It's been great working for you, but I quit. Uh oh. Hey, don't look at me. Can't say as I blame her. So what do you say we do now, counselor? Feel like seeing a movie? Nah, too much violence. Yeah. Sure could go for some doughnuts, though. What am I going to do with you, Lutz? Let's get out of here. The thank you and then and the on and I did not die rest of you.
