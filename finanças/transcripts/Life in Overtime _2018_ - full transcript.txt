Senior Managing Director The time is now 5.00pm. Life in Overtime Mr Tashiro. Thank you for your many years of service. It's too bad I won't be able to learn from you anymore. Drop by anytime. We'll be always waiting. Thanks. If I take you seriously I bet you'll mock me later. This was left in your locker. We hereby bestow this honour to our best performing branch. Branch Manager Tashiro, congratulations. Thank you, sir. Mr Tashiro will be an executive soon. Can't compete with a Tokyo University graduate. Please step forward a little. I was on the executive track but lost out to a rival and was suddenly transferred to a subsidiary. I never got back on the promotion ladder and today, I retire. Mr Tashiro, your taxi is here. It is? At our company, regardless of status retirees are sent home in executive taxis. If all had gone as planned I would've been using them every day. Mr Tashiro, congratulations! Thank you for everything! Please have a good rest! Thanks. Retirement is like a premature funeral. Mr Tashiro, congratulations! Thank you for everything! Please have a good rest! Excuse me. Excuse me. Excuse me. Shall I go around the station? No, that's the long way around. Very well, we'll take your usual commuting route. For the last time. Last time? I'm not dying, you know. You may as well be. Not having a job is torture. I quit once, but went straight back. I see... I'll drive slowly. Tashiro —I'm back. —Welcome home! Well done. Let me take those. Hello. Congratulations, Dad! Sosuke, you've retired at last. Toshi, you came too? Grandpa, here! Oh, thanks! A gold medal for me? Grandpa, toss me! OK! One! Two! Three! Mai! Stop, it's dinner time. Wow, what a feast. Let's make a toast. I'll go get changed. No... you're the guest of honour. Sit down for a drink first. Come on, have a seat. Come on... Oh, thanks. Thank you. Thank you. OK. Mum, you start. Never mind me. Chigusa, you have to. For good luck. Really? All right then. Thank you for all your hard work, dear. You've always been busy so please get some rest now. Thanks. Well, I guess... Cheers! Cheers. —Yummy! —OK, I'll go get changed... Hey, wait. Sosuke, come and take a look. This way... that's it. Now sit. Good. Ready? Here we go. Delicious! Sosuke! Can you see us? Mum! Let's dance! Mum? Miyuki? Toshi went to Morioka to film this. Sorry. Chigusa's taking advantage of you being her cousin. It's fine. Being an illustrator means my schedule is flexible. (Festival chant) What are they doing? That's the Sansa dance from Grandpa's hometown. It's done to wish for happiness, right? To invite and welcome good fortune. (Festival chant) (Festival chant) (Festival chant) Sosuke. Today was your last day, huh? I don't know if that's a good thing or a bad thing... but anyway, you get to drink and that ain't bad. That ain't bad at all! "That ain't bad"? It sure isn't good. —Watch your step. —OK. Here. —Your mother? —Toshi did this too. Sosuke, thank you for your devotion to supporting your family. As the sole breadwinner you made sure they were happy and lived comfortably. Your unwavering dedication to them was more important than any job. Thank you for all you've done. Please bring everyone to see me. I lived for my family and now I'm done. Is that all there is? What a puny life. Sosuke, I hear time goes by differently when you're retired. You're free now. Yes, you've worked so hard for us till now. You can do whatever you like now. That's easy to say. Why not have a fling? A fling? Yes, why not? A fling. An old man with no job no energy and no income? Oh, please. You're still handsome. —Am I? —Some women have strange tastes. Like fossil hunters. Fossil hunter! You're poking fun at me. Chigusa... can we talk? Up till now, my life's been all about work with little time for just the two of us. Let's enjoy life together from now on. So... how about a hot spring trip next week? We could visit my mum in Morioka. Go to Hachimantai and Appi too... I can't take time off at such short notice. The beauty parlour's busy in April. It's the entrance ceremony season. Oh, right! I'll go along with you when I'm free. "Go along"? Summer should be better. OK, good night. Life In Overtime: Day One No job to go to anymore. Good morning. You should relax. You're free at last. Sorry, lunch is leftovers. In the fridge. I'm heading out now. Hikomaro's Lunch Master! Today, I'm at Oizumi Gakuen. Here's our destination. A Mio Agio! Check out this steam! Enter the veggies! So succulent! And so crunchy! Very crisp. Veggies, you're hired! It's like a gallery in here! A fresh Pizza Margherita with ham. A red carpet of ham! It's still that early? And now, enter the pizza! I'll have an early lunch. Coming! Coming! Yes? Hello! Package for Mr Tashiro Sosuke. All right. Seal or sign, please. Where? Here? Yes, there. —Done. —Thank you, sir! —Here you go. —That's it? Nothing else? Yes, that's all. I see. Sealed nude special! Darn it! What am I doing? Graduation from marriage? Yeah. It's all the rage now. Getting a divorce in old age is a hassle so couples just live apart. Without divorcing? Yeah. Maybe I'll give my husband a diploma and throw him out. How about tea? Good idea! There's a new café outside the station... Hi, honey. What are you doing here? I came to pick you up. See you tomorrow then. I'm sorry. See you. Let's go. This is... When Michiko was little we came to see the cherry blossoms. One, two... jump! One, two... jump! —Careful, Michiko! —OK! This place just came to mind. It's so pretty! Michiko. Daddy! Those were good times. "Cherry blossoms scatter." "Those that remain shall also scatter." Right? What's that? Ryokan's farewell poem. Blossoms in bloom feel no sympathy for those that have scattered but they'll scatter too someday. All blossoms are destined to scatter. I never thought about that in my forties. I always looked forward to tomorrow. But now... Shall we go? Thanks for picking me up. You don't have to do that tomorrow. Why not? It's not fair that I'm the only one with a chauffeur. Life in Overtime: Day Two Thank you very much! Hello, sir! That's one thin sliver... I said I'd eat out because I had something to do. She might find out. Hello, ma'am! No household garbage! But I bought this here a while ago... No household garbage! But look... the bag's from here. No household garbage! No more parks or libraries. I have to stay away from geriatric territory. That's the way. Hello. Oh, hello. Hello. Long time no see. Fantastic! —Excuse me. —Yes? Is he an instructor too? Mr Suzuki? He's a member. Apart from him everyone else is an old fogey. Well, people in their sixties usually lose their leg strength but our members walk over 10,000 steps daily. Life in Overtime: Day Three You use an exercise bike mostly? No, I don't just use the gym. —I do aerobics too. —Is that so? Mr Tashiro! You can ride with me. I'm fine. My car's here. Please. Mr Suzuki. Pardon me, but what do you do? Oh, I run an IT company. Then why are you hanging out with the old fogies? "Old fogies"? We're currently developing software targeted at seniors. This is part of my marketing research. Of course. You're a shrewd man. Praise from an ex-Tachibana Bank elite. I'm honoured. News spread fast within the gym. They all know you're a Tokyo University graduate. Well, I am... So much for privacy. Mr Tashiro. You've no intention of working again? I've worked enough for a lifetime. So, you have no regrets? None. Toshi? Oh, Sosuke! Come in. As always, you seem to be doing well with work and women. Women maybe, but work has waned since I turned 50. There's no retirement in my field but I do face getting phased out. Well, I won't fight it. I'll bow out gracefully. You know where you're headed. Not me, not yet. Really? It's as if from the moment I left my job society has no need for me anymore. I guess I still want to work. I'm home! —I'm home. —Welcome home. That's rare, you drinking with Toshi. Well... I wish I still had a job, like you. Why don't you do what you like? Lately, I've been wishing I could start over from the age of 15. Start over? If I could, I'd do everything differently. What about you? Ever wanted to start over? Never. I'll go take a bath. A Handful of Sand by Ishikawa Takuboku Whenever my father coughs in my hometown I cough too. Whenever I'm ill, it scares me. My father was an elementary school teacher. He went to school every day until he retired. My mother also worked so ironing was my father's duty. Dad. Dad, I got into Tokyo University. Sosuke, well done. Well done. What would he think of me now wasting time with nowhere to go and nothing to do? Will you buy that? I mean that. I will... What a dang shame. Oh, matsuri (festival). I know... You know... Kawaii... (cute) Kawaii! OK. Bye... —Take care... bye! —Bye. Rakan! It is you, Rakan! —You're... Ninomiya? —It's me! It must be 30 years! —Doing well? —You bet... How about a drink? Well... I guess I can spare some time. Let me do one thing, and then we'll go! I'll go wait somewhere. Why don't you come with me? Come on! Box! Stop! Break... Box! Stop! Referee! Don't stop them! He can still fight! Are you blind? —Please. —This six-round lightweight bout was stopped by referee Ninomiya Isami... —Delicious! —Make yourself at home. So, what did you say to him? I saw you whispering to the guy who won. "Think of how the guy who lost feels." You're really something. —What? —Giving up a stable career and becoming a great referee. You worked for a big trading company, right? That takes guts. I was in Human Resources. Firing and transferring people for crazy reasons. I wondered if I'd have any pride left by the time I died. You did far better than me. Working for a big bank till retirement, Rakan. Quit calling me that! Hey, ma'am. Isn't he the spitting image of that Buddhist statue of Rakan? Holy cow! You're right! He was our rugby team captain. A stand-up guy. Knock it off. Remember? Your fight with No.16. I remember! What was that about? Our team never won a single game and Rakan here blew his cool. Today, we're going to win. If we've got to play dirty, so be it. Rakan! I'm not going to do that. Why the hell not, No.16? "No.16"? His name was Kawakami. He had the same name and shirt number as that baseball player of Tokyo Giants. Oh, so that's why he was No.16. But in rugby the number 16 is for bench-warmers. He hated it. No.16, huh? That takes me back. So No.16 snapped at Rakan. Rugby is a gentlemen's game! Without rules, tackling and scrumming is thuggery! Enough of that goody-two-shoes crap. Winning is everything! How we play is more important! —What? —I'm right! —Stop it! —You idiots! You've got a game to play! —Coach! —But Dad... I'm not your dad here! If you want to fight, fight to win! Nambu High School! Let's go! Ninomiya! Rakan! Left! After that, we pulled together and won our first victory. —No.16! —Yeah! Yeah, that was how it went. Back then, all I had was hope. I thought I could make anything of my life. You still can, Rakan. I want to referee a world title bout someday. That's my dream right now. I'm beaten. I'm unemployed and idle and he's got a dream. A dream! I'm totally beaten. —You want egg? —Yeah. —So Ninomiya... —Sesame? A pinch. —Compared to him... —Japanese parsley? Are you listening? No. Not to you. All you do is whine. Why are you such a wimp? —I am not. —You are. Pulling a long face all day... talking about blossoms and starting over. Sighing. Complaining. Reminiscing. I don't want to... Then don't. You're my wife. Shouldn't you lend me a listening ear? Don't call me "wife" when it suits you. I've been working since morning and now you come home drunk, wanting noodles. Things are different now. It's about time you accepted that. That was scary. Time to eat. Excuse me. Please, sit down. What an impressive résumé. It's too impressive for an accounting job at a mum-and-pop outfit like ours. But, didn't you already know my background? Yes, the job centre said you're a Tokyo University graduate from Tachibana Bank. My wife said we should at least interview you. I've never met a Tokyo University graduate before. Mr Tashiro, I'm deeply sorry, but... Mr Yamashita, how about you hire me on trial for a few months? —We couldn't! —We couldn't! Having an elite like you work under us would tire us out! Rumours would spread. "A Tokyo University graduate" "working for Yamashita?" "He must be an ex-con!" Anyway, it's so unfair. A Tokyo University graduate and former corporate high-flyer but he can't find a job! Mr Tashiro! Hang in there! —Hang in there. —We're rooting for you! Don't give up! Employment Agency Sosuke! What are your plans after graduation? I'm not sure. Should I join a company or... That's right... then wet the sides. Like this? Good... I'm home. Hi there. I dropped by. Hello. No good, huh? No. I can tell from your face. My schooling torpedoed me. You mean being from Tokyo University? Non-specialist Tokyo University graduates make employers uneasy. I'm going to go to graduate school. Graduate school? What for? Literature. Chigusa, how about it? It's a great idea. Really? It's perfect for you. I'm all for it. Now then, pot stickers! Thanks for the food! Thanks! Thanks. Yummy! Graduate school's a great idea. But why literature? Maybe I was destined to find that Takuboku book. You'll have to pass an essay exam to get in, right? Why not study for the exam at the adults learning centre. The adults learning centre. Yes. I taught illustration there before. They offer a variety of courses. It's a good place to pick up the basics. Now Seeking Students They sure do offer a lot of courses. Ishikawa Takuboku Course I Ishikawa Takuboku Course II Excuse me. Yes? Yes? May I know the difference between these two? Well, in Course I, you study the meanings of Ishikawa's songs in depth. Course II is about Ishikawa himself and Meiji-era history. As well as Meiji-era literature... Sorry. Why not take both? There's a discount for that. I'd rather do one thoroughly... I see. What a dang shame. I knew it! Well... This. Well, I've been wanting this! Oh, so you're the guy from... You said "what a dang shame" then too. In Morioka dialect. Did I? So folks still use that phrase. Oh no, I'm so embarrassed... It's my dialect too. You shouldn't be embarrassed to use it. I'm from Morioka. Where are you from? I'm from Hanamaki. Hanamaki? Eradicate old age odours! —Sir. —Yes? Why did Takuboku write three-line tanka? Yes, about tanka, he wanted to revolutionise and perfect the three-line structure it seems... Tackle the graduate school entrance exam! Congratulations, Grandpa! A Handful of Sand by Ishikawa Takuboku I found another copy of this. That's great! How much is it? Consider it a present. From one Iwate native to another. Don't be shy. Oh my. Thank you kindly! You're all fired up, Mr Tashiro! I found somewhere I can be myself! Awesome! Nice! Kuri? Hello there. Going home? I am. My wife told me to eat out. If you have time... Delicious! What the heck is this? You've lived in Tokyo for quite a while now so why is your dialect still so thick? Maybe because I'm writing a children's book in Morioka dialect. You write for children? It's a goal of mine. I'm writing a story for a competition in dialect. An homage to Miyazawa Kenji. Miyazawa Kenji? The poet? He's known to many as a poet but he called himself a children's author. His masterpiece The Origin Of The Deer Dance is in dialect. He often utilised the Morioka dialect onomatopoeia... Sorry, I did it again. No, it's interesting. If you were my teacher I'd get into graduate school easily. Graduate school? You're applying? At my age. Silly, isn't it? No! Age doesn't matter. I admire you for setting your sights high. I'm home! Hi, dear. Good to see you. You dropped by? I came to see Mum, but Mai fell asleep. My husband's coming to pick us up soon. Where did you eat? It's a secret. A fling... A fling? I never thought I'd have a fling at this age. That's nice. Are you listening? She's 35... 35! So, a thirty-year age gap? Why not? Old male celebrities do it. Maybe, but old men rarely have flings. You two gave me the idea. We didn't think you'd really do it! As your daughter, I don't want to see you get the wrong idea. Pay for meals only for it to lead nowhere and get depressed over it. So please be careful. OK then, what would you two do if it got serious? Well, Mum? I'd be impressed. Miyazawa Kenji Exhibition Thanks for the other day. Miyazawa Kenji Exhibition Ticket You went already? No, I don't know when I can go. Today's the only day she's free. It's really you, Mr Tashiro! What a coincidence. I'm surprised you spotted me. Right away. May I join you? Of course. It suits you. —What? —Your sunglasses. Want some more? I'll take it slowly. Hey, that's too much! But I'm dang happy. A Takuboku fan like you understanding a Miyazawa fan like me. Kuri, you really love Miyazawa, don't you? Don't get the wrong idea though. I love Miyazawa's works but I prefer a different type of guy. Like, what type of guy? Older and broad-minded... Hey, don't make me say that! I've had a wee bit too much. This is totally unlike her. Maybe she's... Five, four... —Good thing I drank less. —Three, two... one, zero. Oh, a phone call. It's a text. But... Today's Mum's birthday! Did you forget? I forgot. Sorry. Get some sleep. I'll wake you when we're near your home. There's no turning back now. Mr Tashiro. Do you have time this week? I'd like to ask you something. This way. Come in. Thank you for making time. Have a seat. So, what's this about? Well, these are my firm Gold Tree's financial and account statements, tax returns, and everything else. Last year, our turnover exceeded 500 million. Mr Tashiro, would you join us as an advisor? What do you say? But, IT isn't my speciality. I'll be honest with you. I want you for your background. You went to Tokyo University and worked at Tachibana Bank. Our staff are all young so your presence would generate greater trust with our clients. We would be honoured to have you. I'm home. Yeah. Sorry I'm late! What's that? Could you dye my hair? You used to practise on me every week. What's this for? Your fling? No. I've been asked to be an advisor. Remember I told you? About that guy Suzuki at the gym. He gave me his financial documents. I took a good look. Everything seems to be in order. Pay's OK too. What do you think? What do you want to do? What I need is a job. I'm not finished yet. Then I'd better dye your hair once every two months. Thanks. Now, let's hear from our new advisor. I'm Tashiro. I'm 63 so I guess I'm twice or three times your age. But I have twice or three times your experience. I'm certain this will be useful for the company. I look forward to working with you. Takahashi, can you go to Myanmar next week? —Sure. Watanabe, arrange it. —Got it. I'll go to Tachibana Bank tomorrow. Please do. So, we'd be grateful if you could provide the financing. This is our project proposal. Let's see. Mr Tashiro... It's looking good. —Thank you! —Thank you! —I'll keep at it. —OK. Dear Kuri, how are you? I was offered a job to be an advisor at an IT company. I can't attend school for a while. Keep working towards your dream! Dear? —Heading home too? —Yeah. How was it? Tiring. I don't have the stamina anymore. But you look so much happier with a job. —I do? —Your suit's alive. Alive? Like it used to be. Your suit is breathing. The Myanmar deal's done. Thanks to you. —Don't say that. —Are you free to talk —About our next business trip? —Sure. Sir, by the way, about our software aimed at seniors... —Sir! —What's wrong? Hey! Somebody! Call an ambulance! —Sir! —Suzuki! —Suzuki! —Sir! Hey! Call an ambulance! Suzuki! —Hang in there! —Hurry, please! Suzuki! May I see him? Daddy, are you asleep? Daddy, are you asleep? Daddy's asleep right now. His son's still so little. It's so sad. So, what are you going to do now? It was Suzuki who hired me. The next president won't want me around. I'll ask about resigning tomorrow. Takahashi, I think this month... Mr Tashiro, please be our president. It's beyond me. Please take over! Please take over! Oh, you're home? You startled me. Hey, listen. We really need to talk... What's wrong? Could you dye my hair? But aren't you quitting? They asked me... to be the president. —I think I'll accept it. —What? I'm totally against this. —Why? —Because being president is a much heavier responsibility. Haven't you done enough? I can still work. I've made up my mind! By introducing a new system you can create many benefits. Such as optimising management resources. I hope you'll consider our proposal. President Tashiro. You're a trustworthy partner. I've taken the decision to approve your proposal. Thank you. —Thank you. —Thank you. Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir. Hello? Sorry to call you out of the blue. Is everything OK? Well, I was just wondering how you are. Kuri, are you drunk? Don't say that! I'm not drunk. Are you crying? Why would I be crying? I can tell you are. What happened? I want to see you. I really want to see you, Mr Tashiro. Sorry, I shouldn't have said that. This weekend... I have a conference at Hotel Gimpa in Atami. Want to come? But... you'd have to stay a night at the hotel... I'll be there. I can stay. Sorry about this. Why don't you take a shower? All system ready. What happened? I've come to hate myself so much I could die. What happened? I have a friend who dreams of being a children's author too. She won the competition. I can't be happy for her. In fact I wish she'd get into an accident. I really hate myself... for thinking that way. Kuri... Why not give up on your dream? Why's that? I don't think you have the talent for it. What an awful thing to say. But... you've been striving in vain for 10 years. That shows you have no talent. Try something different. But that means I'd have wasted 10 years of my life. Just 10 years. If you don't quit now you'll be wasting your whole life. You have a good many years left. I'm only saying this out of love. Love... I knew... coming here was the right thing to do. I'm glad. Then, I guess we should... We should. Yes, sir. Well, I booked a room at a hotel near the station. But you said you'd stay. I can't afford to stay here. You can stay with me. You're not a schoolgirl. You knew what you're getting into by coming here, right? Of course I knew. Then why? When we talked on the phone I was miserable, and I didn't care anymore, so I just... I'm sorry. I'll call you after I get back to Tokyo. Bloody hell! Bloody hell! Incoming call: Chigusa Hello? Dear? When will you be back? Well... What is it? Oh, nothing. We really need to talk. All right. Tell me tomorrow. OK, bye. "We really need to talk"? Don't tell me she knows I'm having an affair? Wait, scratch that! What affair? We didn't even hold hands! She wouldn't believe me though. I'm home! —Welcome home. —I'm home. A souvenir from Atami. Thanks. You must be tired. You want to talk? It can wait. Get changed first. Surely not divorce? I want to know. Tell me. Really? I need your seal on this. Wait! What papers are these? Why are you all worked up? I want to start my own business. Your own business? Yes. I found a great location. I want to open a hair salon there. —Oh! I thought... —You thought what? Well... what about... the start-up money? Ten million yen. I've been saving up. This is the layout. Have a look. What do you think? —Looks good. —Really? I'm so glad. Look at this too. There's a counter here. Yeah. Not bad, right? Sir! Excuse me. One moment, please. The deadline has already passed. You still haven't wired the three million dollars! My apologies. Our CEO is a prominent cabinet minister in Myanmar. But to our surprise he has been arrested for bribery. But that's not our problem. Once the software is installed we can no longer retrieve the product. I am aware of that, but... If... I understand the circumstances. However, I'd like to know how do you intend to pay? We're trying to gather the money... We're truly sorry. This is the one. Flowers on the other side. I see. All right. Call me if there are any updates. Hey, are you done? Mai's with my in-laws for once. I thought we could have dinner together. Sorry, I'm almost done here. Sosuke, you seem busy. Well, I guess. He has been flying to Myanmar a lot lately. Better that than heartbreak at his age. Toshi's almost the same age as me. Listen, illustrators like Toshi and other freelancers have a totally different vibe. So women go for them. I'm not so different. Toshi! I'm here! Everyone, this is Hamada Kuri. My girlfriend. Your girlfriend? —Well... —Remember I said I taught illustration at the adults centre? Kuri is a receptionist there. I'm Toshihiko's cousin, Chigusa. I'm her daughter Michiko. Oh, nice to meet you. And this is... Miss Hamada! Good to see you. Remember me? Oh, right! You go to her school. Your family's all here, so I'd better... I thought you're staying tonight. Staying? Miss Hamada, we're going off actually. No! I'm the one who's intruding. Sorry. I'll make it up to you in Atami. Atami? You're going together? Well... Have you heard of Hotel Gimpa in Atami? Kuri wants to go there. She went to their restaurant on some errand. Meeting me was an "errand"? She was your fling, wasn't she? That's ridiculous. You can't hide it. I knew instantly. You fell head over heels but it was unrequited, right? Come on, that's how it goes! Most old men are just meal tickets. They might get lucky once out of sympathy as meal payment. Meal payment? Hello? Sir, it's Takahashi. Our client in Myanmar went bankrupt. Can your company cope? If it can't repay its debts the president must act in accordance with our agreement. You'll have to take on the entire debt yourself. I'm fully aware of that. How do you like the flyer? I'll be home late today. Two more of our staff quit today. They were among our best. I think this is it for the company. But if we go down, you'll take on our debt... Don't worry. I have some savings. My wife's starting a business. I can sponge off of her. Suzuki Naoto What legacy can we leave behind? I'm sure you're all aware but this is the end of Gold Tree. As the president of Gold Tree this is entirely my responsibility. I'm truly sorry. Oh, man. This wouldn't have happened if Mr Suzuki were still here. Despite what's going on here your wife's starting her own business? Lucky her. I'm home. I'm home. Your company's bankrupt? One of your staff came to the shop. Oh. Bankruptcy means you're in debt, aren't you? How much? We tried to minimise it but it's around 90 million yen. What'll you do? As the president, I have to repay it. Liquidating my assets will pay off part of it, but... I'll still be 10 million yen in debt. 10 million yen? Not my business... Don't worry. It's in your name, like this home. The bank won't be able to touch you. But how will you repay it? Well... in the worst case, I could off myself and pay with life insurance. Don't joke about that! I told you I was against it but you went ahead with it anyway. —Yeah. —Why do you only think about yourself? You always have. Always deciding for yourself. You never spare a thought for me. —Calm down. —Liquidate your assets? That's our assets. I contributed to it too. You think you earned it all by yourself? Chigusa? Hey! You're leaving? I don't want to breathe the same air as you. Please get out! This is actually pretty relaxing. National High School Rugby Championship The 97th Iwate Prefecture preliminary final is about to begin. It's kick-off time. Rakan! Over here! Ninomiya! —Rakan... —How have you been? I'm surprised you came. Our alma mater's heading for Hanazono. I won't miss it for the world. Rakan! Do you remember me? I'm Kudo! Kudo! Kudo! How are you doing? —Oh, good! —You got younger. Get out of here! Pass... The score is 10 to 7. Nambu High School to kick off. Go for it! Go for it, Nambu! Pass... Pass it! Pass... Go... They did it! They did it. Three minutes left on the clock. The score is 14 to 10. Nambu leads by four points. Come on... Iwate turns it around! 15 to 14! Iwate High School with a stunning turnaround! The whistle blows! Full time! Nambu versus Iwate, 14 to 17 Well, they lost. Never mind. Good effort! Good play... Thank you very much! Lift your heads, lads! —Good job! —Good play! After the 2011 earthquake, Kudo quit his insurance job in Tokyo and came back. Oh, the tsunami... I saw my hometown in ruins and felt I had to do something. I've started an NPO. An NPO? Rakan, you're an ex-bank man. Tax returns and stuff confuse me. I'd appreciate some help. He's an IT company president! He doesn't have time for your NPO. That's cold. Even No.16 helps me out sometimes. No.16? Without rules tackling and scrumming is thuggery! —What? —I'm right! You idiots! You have a game to play! But Dad... I'm not your dad here! He's here now? Running his dad's photo studio. Didn't he go to Kyoto University to study astronomy? He lost his wife and son in an accident 10 years ago. After that... Kawakami Photo Studio Excuse me. Remember me, sir? I'm Tashiro. Is that you, Rakan? Yes. Good to see you, sir. Don't be so formal. It's me, No.16. I got old! You thought I was my dad? No... Actually, yeah. Dad, Rakan is here to visit. Coach... He has dementia. He wanders, so I can't take my eyes off him. I see. So Rakan, still winning like you always did? Oh yeah. Take a look at this. I found it myself. Amateur astronomer discovers star! That's amazing. Well, I only just got back into stargazing. Till a while back I didn't feel like doing anything. But I finally understand now. You can't fight memories and win. What really matters is how you go on living. —Over here... —Rakan. Did you see No.16? I saw Coach too. Yeah? Got work tomorrow? What time is your train? Ninomiya... I'm not a president anymore. The company went bankrupt and my wife threw me out. Plus, I'm 90 million yen in debt. Flat broke. I... didn't come back till now... because of my pride. I was the team captain. I attended Tokyo University. I joined Tachibana Bank. I impressed everybody. So, after I was transferred to a subsidiary and after I retired I was too embarrassed to come back. I'm ashamed of what I've become. I thought I'd keep winning and become powerful and important. Drink up, Rakan. All of us here thought the same. Even so, we all ended up... pretty much the same. Yeah. Rakan, look. We were... We were all young once. Now we're... just old geezers! But we're still alive. We're still alive! We aren't done with life! Rakan, let's dance... Kudo! Let's dance! Dance! We're going to dance... Let's dance! Hey, lady! Drums... Rakan! Get happy... (Festival chant) (Festival chant) No... (Festival chant) (Festival chant) If we'd known you were coming we would've cleaned it. I have some free time. OK. Thanks. Dear, your pride and joy, Sosuke, has come home. It's as beautiful as ever. That's how everyone feels when they see their hometown. You always have a place to come home to. To: Tashiro Chigusa Congratulations on your grand opening! Nice, right? It's cute. Sosuke? Let's go in. Dad! The opening's tomorrow. Where were you? I went to Morioka. Your mother... is she well? Yeah. How are the preparations coming along? Good. We should be able to open. Chigusa's been worried since she threw you out. Chigusa. I'm sorry. I've always ignored your concerns... and acted selfishly. I'm truly sorry. The longer I stay at our place the more I'll hurt you. Let's get a divorce. Dad... How will you live? An old classmate back in Morioka wants me to help with his NPO. I'm of little use but if I could contribute to my hometown I would like to do it. I won't agree to a divorce. Mum... You said you're not finished and gave us so much trouble. Now you want a divorce so you won't hurt me? How selfish can you get? Even if we did divorce you wouldn't be able to pay alimony and it'd only leave a nasty aftertaste. You're so spineless, Mum. Michiko... What do you mean? What Dad did was wrong. It wasn't your fault. After everything that has happened you ought to break up. So why don't you? To keep up appearances? If that's why you won't, you're pathetic! Michiko, that's too harsh. Michiko, calm down. And you're being naïve, Dad thinking you can start over back home. They only think you're special because you work in Tokyo! You won't be special if you go back! Anyway... talk it over and work it out. Michiko! Michiko! Michiko! Stop! Michiko. Never mind me. You shouldn't talk like that to your mother. But it's the truth! You don't know why Mum wants her own business. She thought of it when you were transferred. Companies don't always promote those who are competent or with potential. So she wants to use her skills to support you. She's doing it for me? But now, her business is her dream. Instead of staying together for form's sake free yourselves! You have a long life ahead of you. Is that what you want? Even if you break up you're still my parents, right? It's opening day at last. Take care. Thank you so much! Congratulations! Thanks! They're so pretty! Sara, look after her. Hello, ma'am. This way, please. Take these, would you? Just leave it there. You really came. I'm so glad. —Any requests? —Layer it a bit for me. A Handful of Sand by Ishikawa Takuboku Enough. Enough. Let's... graduate. Graduate? Yes. Graduate from our marriage. Mr Tashiro! Toshi told me you're leaving today. I really wanted to tell you how grateful I am. I gave up on becoming a children's author. You told me straight-up that I should give up. It was the impetus I needed. Really? Thank you so much. Anyway, take care. You take care too, OK? Hello, Iwate Recovery Network. Yes? 1,000 for Kuji City and Miyako City? Will do. Thank you. Mr Tashiro, could you? Of course. "Cherry blossoms scatter." "Those that remain shall also scatter." Sosuke! Chigusa? What brings you here? Your hair. I came to dye it. I'll come every two months. You seem younger. Maybe you just got older. Well, I sure can't help that.
