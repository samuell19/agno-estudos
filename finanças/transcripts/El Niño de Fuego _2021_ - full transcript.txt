Look! Look what's coming. Look at… …that cheeky face. Exactly a month before the accident. That cheeky face. The first letter he wrote. THE MARK OF THE HOSPITAL CLASSROOM OF VALL D'HEBRON "My name is Aleixo Paz. I am nine years old and I had an accident on 8th September 2009 with my father in his truck." "My whole body was burned. I've been in intensive care ever since." "I've had 13 operations and I still need more." "I want to go home. I'm tired of being here." "When I ask Mom why this had to happen to me, she tells me to look around at the children in the other beds." "Why them?" "They say I'm brave, a champ." "I feel like crying, but I hold it inside because otherwise Mom and Dad also cry." "I don't want them to cry." "They say that I give them strength to go on but it's them who give me strength." "Sometimes I get angry and rude and I yell at them, but then I ask them to forgive me." "My fingers have been cut but I can use them on the computer." "Mom says I will be able to do all the things I used to do, I'll have special gloves for my hands." "Now I believe her." "Aleixo Paz, nine years old." My boy. A traffic accident involving a diesel tanker caused a forest fire and forced the closure of the northbound AP7 motorway. The driver and his son in the tanker were both hurt. The nine-year-old boy suffered serious burns and was airlifted by helicopter to a hospital. The boy is in critical condition in intensive care with burns on 90% of his body and has suffered two cardiac arrests. Hey, come here! Come here. Furia, come here! Come, and sit. Come! Hey! Come, sit. There you go. Look what I've got. Look! There, off you go! Run! Come on, Furia, bring it here! I keep drinking while I watch the stars Waiting for their return, just like that Deceiving myself The lack of sleep oppresses me I lost track of time The clock is ticking The four elements are against me I keep going against the tide It's another day in the 'hood Daydreaming Blowing smoke in all directions I keep drinking while I watch the stars Waiting for their return, just like that Deceiving myself The lack of sleep oppresses me I lost track of time The clock is ticking I keep going against… I can't remember. That's what happens when I change the lyrics. Okay, okay, okay. - I don't remember that. - How could you remember? You were only one, Aleixiño. - Why am I watching this? - You were only one. Look at your sister, look. I don't want to see me as a baby, man. Your first Night of the Three Kings. - Look, you're dancing, Aleixo! - So what? I'm a baby. - You are so annoying. - Let me watch this a moment. Your brother yelled "Aleixo, stop," and you didn't listen. - You kept going around. - Yes, I remember. You said "one each," but you kept going. Afterwards you did let him. But your brother stood before you. You see! Your brother stood before you. I think it's here, when you crash. Yes, here. You were going so fast! Look, look, look! We all ran over to you. You drove her crazy. Come on, come on! - That's not me anymore, he's dead. - What?! - That's someone else. - No way. It's still you. Mom, you can say whatever you want. I'm not like I was before. And I know that much better than you all. You can say whatever you want. What the hell do you know? What the fuck do you know? You don't know shit. Well, you may feel different but to me… In order to feel different you don't have to be different. That's what I'm saying. You may feel different but… I don't need to feel it, I know it. - But to me you are still the same. - Here we go again. Look, I don't feel like talking and I don't give a shit about what people think, OK? - OK, fine. - I don't give a shit. About what you or what anyone else thinks, I don't care. How could you fucking know? You think you are so smart and you have no idea. Let me see your arms. We were planning to open. Stretch it as much as possible and do the back. We were thinking about opening up here in front. - Yes, and in the back. - And putting a skin graft here. That's what we agreed on. - Tell me when it hurts. - Here. - Here, where? - It hurts back there. - Up here? - Back there and below a bit. So, we will get skin from here and here, placing a total groin skin graft there, do the ectopic thing with a total skin graft from behind your right ear, okay? Then open also here, because this is where it pulls. - Yes, back here. - And an integra here and there. We will definitely do the eye, the elbows, the anti-cubital fossas, the gluteus, and the armpit, both the posterior pillar and here on the shoulder. Do you want it? Here. Where shall I put the pill? Here? Shall I lock you up or leave it open? Don't worry, I'll close. It's another day in the neighborhood Daydreaming Smoke billowing to the four winds I roll the dice, used to losing I don't play hoping to win I play till I faint Feeling like crying But my tears won't come out They remain imprisoned Sometimes I want to give up Suicidal impulses in a broken mind Cutting my arms so I don't cut my veins Drowning my cries in liquor Trying to communicate With myself through the paper I'd like to stop being a coward Stop running from death and run after it Grab her by the feet, and show her That she can't mess with this beast Let's go up there. Marta needs to be admitted again to the hospital for surgery. You can call her if you want. - When? - I think it'll be soon. She always asks for you, "I haven't seen Aleixo in a while." I just don't… You don't write anymore! I know, I'm missing from everywhere. Do you remember when it happened? I didn't lose consciousness in no time. And do you still dream about it? - All the time. - Really? Well, it's more like… daydreaming. The problem is not being asleep, the problem is… having weird dreams, man. I have, I don't know… I've never had normal dreams, I've always had nightmares, that's all. You're still young, you're not 50 years old. I know, that's what I've been telling myself for a long time. It would be different if you were 50 years old, but you have a life to live. You have to… Sure, but that's the problem, that I don't… …I don't want it, man, a life to live. What do you mean? I've never expected to turn 30, no way. Neither did I. I live from day to day, but live your best life, man. I just want to get to the end, you know? That's all. - And what's the end? To die? - Yeah. But I want to die in a… - Dignified way. - Sure. - I wanna die happy. - No, I don't care about how I die, but about my life. I haven't done anything. I haven't overcome anything. I'm stuck. How long ago did you get burned? - Eight or nine years ago. - Nine? I got burned 20 years ago. It was 20 years ago. I don't remember at which point I was after eight years burned. But I wasn't like you, because I found… …the motivation, like I said, I was far wrong. They took it from me. - Well. - When you let them… That was my problem, that I let them take it away from me. And when you let them tell you "you can't" … …it's over. It's your decision if you want it to change. Yeah, I know. You must motivate yourself. There'll be good and bad things. - At least you can try. - That's it. You have to try. I've accomplished a lot by changing my attitude. But not leaving the house is easier. Of course. Not socializing is easier. But obviously everyone has different interests. The only thing I like is writing. And I write songs, that's what I want to do. Great, set a goal. Music is a good idea, I like music. Even if I don't get anything out of it, at least I'd leave… …something behind. I mean, I put my feelings down on paper, so I'll never forget them. That's good. You want to leave something behind. It's the only way. That's great. Some people don't want to. That's a motivation, man. What's up, bro? Light, bro. Here, but I don't have much battery left. - Look at Aleixo, what a pro. - Will it hang in there or not? Salt City, like I say As if it were my neighborhood Every day, living the same movie I had nothing to eat Nor money for another joint You know, I used to have it all You know, I used to have money to spread And now look, I keep doing evil But I'm just doing my thing Come on, Aleixo, your turn. I'm an antisocial A growing danger A slum kid who was born crazy I don't say what I feel I feel what I say, I don't even… I don't even understand myself And look at me I'm still here playing chess with my life As if it was nothing As if I had nothing to do You know, you know It's dark now, but in the daytime you can see the mountains. What time is it? Just look at the light, bro. Hey, dude. I was setting things up. I'll be right over. I'll be there, okay? See you. Hello? You checked in on time, bastard. No, for one day. How's it going? What's up? How are you? - I'm on time. - You bastard! You know? - Glory… - Listen. - I want to fly and fly… - To glory - I don't want to go through… - Through ruin - I want to fly and find… - My victory - To leave something behind… - In life - I want to fly and fly… - To glory - I don't want to go… - Through ruin - I want to fly and find… - My victory - To leave something behind… - In life They'll say I don't value the air I breathe Forgetting this world is contaminated I walk without knowing where I stand I got to know you when I was locked up I got used to this pain, to bleeding To not sleeping Seeing my mother cry How many times do we move the path? And if we could, we'd change our destiny - You see, motherfucker? - Because you're here, bro. - What? 'Cause I'm here, bugger? - Yes, it turned out great. - It has another vibe, you know why? - 'Cause you've changed it. Because this time you wrote it keeping the beat, you know? I mean, one, two, three, four, one, two… The beat, you know? Music can bring you happiness, it can bring you sadness… There are people who sing because of anger, or pain… I'm one of them, man. I sing because of anger. Well, it's a way to let off steam. I feel better doing this than punching the wall, bro. And I obviously get hurt by punching the wall. I know, look at your hand, bugger. The good thing is that I can't feel it. Usually I barely feel my hand, but now I can't feel it. I can't feel it and I can't feel my fingers. - So, see you on Thursday? - On Thursday, bro. At around the same time as today, OK? Around five. That's at twelve o'clock for you. - No, come in early. - At one o'clock I'm here. Sure, show up early and we'll have lunch together. I won't be late, no way. - See you. - See you soon. Give me a hug, you asshole. It's been great. It'll be amazing, you'll see. - Let's go, I'll go with you. - Okay. What the hell is that noise? - What noise? - I don't know. I'm walking. It comes from motorbikes. But it's so quiet here, isn't it? Come this way. Let's see. What the fuck? - What's up, brother? - The usual. Thanks so much, everybody. What a thing. Happy birthday to you Happy birthday from all of us Happy birthday to you - Thanks, everybody. - Here's to Aleixo! - Thank you, sister. - You're welcome. Because my brother wouldn't organize this, I'm sure about that. Your brother would prepare something different. I knew… why would she ask what I want? - What's this? - It's for recording music. - Really? - Sure. - What's that? - Headphones for recording. - From where you bought… - Yes, where you bought that… - Where I bought the sound card. - Yes! Thanks! It's just what I needed. Now you have to dedicate a song to us with your new headphones. Hello, to give you my CV. - Your CV? Okay. - And where could I drop it off? - Hello there, tell me. - Hello, how are you? - I'm here to leave my CV. - Great. - What's your name? - Aleixo. - Aleixo? Okay. - I've recently got my license. - And where have you worked, Aleixo? - Nowhere, I have no experience. No experience, alright. But you've done a course in transporting boxes. - Yes, recently. - Good! I'd really like to work on that. If anything comes up we'll call you. - Perfect, thanks. - Well, take care. - Thanks. - Goodbye. It looks like there's only one left, though. - You have to clean my wound. - Yes, I'll clean it now, hold on. Complicated, it's been hard… Done. There you go, honey. - What's all that beeping? - A wedding or something. You're done. - You have a spare tablet right? - This one… - What are you missing? - Nothing. You have tablets of 40 or 20. There was one of 20 that I took with me. Aleixiño, are you going to see Dad today? - Yes, later. - Are you? Later? - Yes! - Okay. Why? Just asking, it's the weekend and he's never here during the week. He must be here already. Okay then. I'm going to get a coffee, smoke a cigarette and take five. Puriña, what are you doing? - I knock on both, just in case. - Fuck. - How are you, Dad? - How are you? - It's so hot. - Yes. - How are you? - Is it hot today? Yeah. - How was the test? - I passed. - Great! Congratulations! - Thanks. - So… all good? - Yes. - You didn't make any mistakes? - I don't know. They don't tell you. - Don't they? - No. - Did you get mad at the examiner? - No, it was fine. That's important. See? You have to be calm. - They didn't even make me park. - Damn! You got lucky then. On the highway. They told me "go where you like." When I saw the entrance I got onto it. I have something for you. - What do you have? - Something for you. What thing? Come on. Look. Where are you going? This way. This looks really good, doesn't it? - This looks really good. - Of course. But it's so hot in here, I'm getting out. This looks really good. - We'll go for a ride later, right? - Okay, sure. - Thank you. - You're welcome. You have to be careful, though. Without running. - Does it go fast? - But don't run. - But does it go fast? - Yes! Cool. You saw the photo I sent you, right? Did you see his nose? His face, his cheeks, all swollen. He has Dad's cheeks. I didn't look that closely. I just looked and was like… fuck. He has Dad's cheeks. It was noticeable… mind-blowing. - Because it is an ultrasound in 5D. - My goodness. - We had a 5D ultrasound. - I'm getting old, 3D is gone. It's so close. A month, are you ready? No. Don't tell us anything until he's born 'cause the wait, dude… No, I won't say anything because I want to be alone. The wait… I'm not good at waiting. - When he comes out… - Exactly. Then I'll send a photo. "Here he is." - And that's it. - Hey, I'm here. I'm making music with El Chaca. Who's El Chaca? You don't know El Chaca? The boxer? He's a boxer and also a rapper. All I've ever wanted is to write my own songs… …what I think, what I feel, stays there. I put everything in my songs, nothing else. I never thought about a stage or anything like that, you know? For me what is important is to get it all out, to write something good enough. As long as I do that nothing else matters. If we do something, it must be good. - One time I found… - A cassette tape? I found one from Estopa and said leave it there. - It works with a cassette tape? - Yes. - Nervous or what? - A little. Now you just relax, we'll sit down for a bit there, - We won't record it all in one go. - Well, if I can… We can sit down, you practice, and you're ready. I need to warm up my voice, or else I will lose my voice. - That's the doorbell, isn't it? - I hope so. - Buddy! - What's up, brother? How are you? Come here, come in. Man, I have a lump in my throat, for fuck's sake. When you need to fine up and you don't find the notes, and you need to be calmer while you're racing, do just like me. You breathe in, normally. Then you do this. He has a lot of air. I don't have those lungs, man. Breathe out. More, more, you have more, I'm telling you. - Now. - I definitely can't see like that. They'll say I don't value the air I breathe Forgetting this world is contaminated I walk without knowing where I stand I got to know you when I was locked up I got used to this pain, to bleeding To not sleeping, seeing my mother cry How many times do we move the path? And if we could, we'd change our destiny I'm still alive I feel more than I say I'm looking for the way out of this maze Self-destructive, it's my cycle I have wounds that won't heal, man - That's it! - So much anger. That's why you wanted this, right? Pure rage, man, that's fucking it. - That's it. - Now he can't complain. That was it, it was amazing. Fucking amazing, I could feel it a bit. Fuck, you even danced. - Come on, this is it! - Wait, wait! - I got up so early. - But you're late as usual. Yeah, that's true. What about you? Just here, getting bored. Bored? You have a swimming pool over there. - Yeah, but going alone is… - Now I go change. - Let's go for a swim, yeah? - Yeah. So cold, bro. I can feel around here how it cuts off my breathing, bro. Get in, you bastard, get in. You see? Now you feel it too. I'm already soaked. Get up there, see if you can. Let's see if it sinks. Look, it went flat, bro. Fuck. Fuck. They haven't called me. - From anywhere? - No, man. Wait a week, there's no rush. Not even the factory, bro. Don't rush. My brother is going to talk to ETT or something like that. Temporary Work Agencies, I think. - I just want a job. - And you'll get one, you'll see. I'll probably drop off more CVs. - Go for it. - But I don't know where. I've thought of Hostalric. They're looking for people in Ramon Noguera. - No idea. - For people with disabilities. - But what is that? - It's a foundation. - For what? - I don't know. I don't know, they have horticulture and stuff like that. Fuck! Take your pills, honey. - Leave them there. - Here? Okay. I'm not going like this. I'm going to the doctor so they give me a shot. I may leave and feel worse there… I don't fucking feel like it. No, man, I'm feeling cold all the time. But you don't feel like throwing up, or do you? I feel really full, man. - Take it easy, darling. - I have no other desire. I can't feel anything else. - I know, son. - If I do anything, I'll throw up. Go ahead, Aleixo. It's every week lately. He has a big episode every week. - Even two episodes. - Is the pain daily? - Every day again. - Every day gets worse. Was it less frequent at some time? - Yes, a while ago. - It was a while ago. Has it nothing to do with food or is it related to it? I don't know if I feel worse when I eat or when I don't. Another treatment option that we've discussed is a stent. Right? So we can see if there's a dilated area in the pancreas. And another much more aggressive option would be surgery. But I don't really want to offer this kind of treatment, especially surgery, which is a final decision, if I'm not sure. I can't send you to the O.R. without being sure of its origin. - It's not a good option. - It'd have been in vain. Exactly. Let's hope we finally solve it. - Sure. - See you soon. You know, the poor thing… …he has had enough. Haven't you, my boy? Yes, he has had enough. It was endless, dude… What've you been up to? Writing? Writing until five or six in the morning. That's great. What shall we buy? Something simple, right? - What are you going to give him? - This. But he's just a baby, when is he going to use that? This one. It says "six months." "Six months." - What's he going to do with that? - To play, man. Or… What about this? We could give him a rattle, right? It'd be nice. This one. We can take something, but… Look at this, bro. He's going to love it. Even I like it. It makes noise, bro. - He could hurt himself with that. - Well… - It can be dangerous. - Take it. Take it. It can't hurt him, you see? - Put it in here. - And the receipt, okay? - Thank you very much. - Thanks, bye. I've bought him something. Have you? A little something. What's up, man? Here you are, little man. How cool! They're nice, right? With that vivid color. There were other ones in black, which is more my style but… - Wait, how do I open this? - These are more vivid, you know? Look at this, sweetheart. What has your uncle brought you? - What about graduating from school? - No… From the adult school. That can also open doors for you. That's the nonsense they told me in the training course. I said "no." Of course not. I want to work, man. Yes, but in order to work, you need to have at least… You learn by working. I want to work, not mess around. I'm not up for classes and shit. You can do both. - Yes, if I wanted to. - The adult school also has… The adult school has night-time lessons. You'd like that. - You wouldn't get up at 7:00 a.m. - Yeah, that'd be nice, but no. No. It could help you to write your lyrics. It depends. If you look for trouble, it won't. I don't wanna take lessons with four assholes busting my balls. I'd feel worse. - No, man, don't worry about people. - I'd be worse. C'mon, you're not a kid. Exactly, I'm not a fucking kid, I could end up in jail. That's not a place for kids, just for people who need to work. Right. - And they need a certificate. - I need to work. - That's why people… - A certificate is useless. - Do you want sugar? - Yes, please. Fuck, that burns. Where's the sugar? - Are you going to the concert? - What? Sure. - Doors open at seven. - Okay, but… - Come any time. - I don't know when we're going. They said I'll be onstage around nine. Okay. - Or before then. - Are you ready? - Yes, so ready. - Not nervous? Today I am, tomorrow too. We'll see that day. You should be better that day. This is difficult. Who knows where everything is. For God's sake. - Look how ugly this is! - Let me see. - That's from my first communion. - Yes. - And what do you want? - Nothing. I'm not taking random things. I want what I want from years ago. That… - You remember it, don't you? - Sons of… - It's a photomontage, but good. - Yes, it is, but… it disgusts me. Okay. Sometimes you think about things, right? All the time. So what? But that has nothing to do with it. One thing is the accident and another thing is… whatever. It's not the same. - I don't know… - What? Was it your fault? - No, son. - Who got in the truck at 3:00 a.m.? - You. - That's it. It's just… No, but come on, I mean… If… If, as a result of that… - It was partly my fault, I think. - And so do I. Everyone does. But, I don't know, we have… …to make an effort… …to start over, for instance, to work. And to be okay, right? As much as possible. That's it, that's what you have to do. - That's what I do. - Fine. - I am on it. - That's it. I don't want you to feel bad, or… I don't have any problem with that. I know that from day one. I have no problem. - I'm trying to make a living. - Okay. That's it. It's natural to make a living, but… …you also have to think that, for instance… …this thing you're smoking every day… - …it's a problem. - It could be worse. - That's true. - There we go then. - That has nothing to do with it. - But to look for a job, for example, maybe now… I'll work first and then they'll see if… - Sure, but… - It's my belly, not what I smoke. I'm looking for a job. Not monthly classes or anything. A job. I don't want to beg from anyone. - Look, it's not about begging. - Yes, it's my fucking problem. I'm telling you, it's my life, it's my problem. - But your problem is also mine. - Yeah, it is… - Even if you don't think so. - And Mom's and everyone's problem. - Okay, Dad, one day I'll run off. - Don't say that, man. - You're talking nonsense. - It's not nonsense, it's reality. Who has the problem here? That's it, man. The problem is mine. The problem is yours and mine too. It's just mine. It's not even Mom's, and she lives with me, so just get a sense of it. It's five in the afternoon. I'm not good at singing, especially in public. But at home I go crazy, looking for a way out through the windows. Forgive me, I'm starting to be tempted to fall again, but this time I won't get up. It really hurts to be fighting for so long, to end up beating yourself up, without knowing the reason. I want it all to end tonight, to free my mind and everyone forgets me. But instead, I hold back when I think of how it would affect others. How the people I love would feel if they found my body… …lying on the ground. For a moment I convince myself that everything would be better. I clench my teeth, I try not to think, in order just to jump. I close my eyes in vain. I realize I can't leave without giving something in exchange, something that shows that all the suffering was worth it. When you go into surgery, remember… Well, they'll see. But if they don't, tell them that your flange is broken. - Well, see you in a few hours. - See you tomorrow. I love you so much. Everything will be fine, you'll see. Okay, honey? Let's go for surgery number 43. No, 44. This is number 44. I'm not sure if you have an appointment with the doctor. But we can go whenever you want. Okay? Alright, let's start at the elbow. How is it feeling? Is it okay? Stay in place, damn it. There's no way it can stay there. There we are. It's done. Good luck, sonny. Good luck, good luck… You'll do great. - Okay? - Enough, Mom. Do your best, sweetheart, okay? And stay calm, don't be nervous. Once you start, you got it made. - Look who's here. - Waiting for you, you bastard. - Well… - What's up? What do you think? - It's cool, isn't it? - Very cool. The concert is going to be here. Would you prefer the mic stand or to hold it yourself? - I don't know. I was doubting that. - I mean, there's a mic stand… You can either use a stand or you can hold it yourself. Yeah, I think it's better with the stand. - With the stand. - Yes. Make sure you're comfortable. Right there is fine, yeah. I'm here, okay? - If you skip the chorus… - No, I know… …if you skip the chorus, I can do it. And you keep going. Okay? And considering that you have a low rapping voice, get closer to the mic. - I think it's a bit low. - I'll bring it up a bit more. - How are you? - Here, working. Thank you. Hands up! All together! Now I'm going to do a very special track. It's a new one, you bastards. A track I know you all like. So I want to call on stage… a friend, a brother. I want you to welcome him with some noise. Good evening. Let's do this! I'd like you to turn on your cellphones, you bastards. I want everyone with your cellphone flashlight. The Boy from the Blaze The Boy from the Blaze I am… yeah… - I want to fly and fly - To glory -I don't want to go -Through ruin I want to fly and find -My victory To leave something behind -In life They'll say I don't value the air I breathe Forgetting this world is contaminated I walk without knowing where I stand I got to know you when I was locked up I got used to this pain, to bleeding To not sleeping, seeing my mother cry How many times do we move the path? And if we could, we'd change our destiny I'm still alive I feel more than I say I'm looking for the way out of this maze Self-destructive, it's my cycle I have wounds that won't heal, man Listen, brother, We'll fly when you say it That's life Difficulties motivate me Go on even if they say you can't Be like Chaca Killing rats with your hands It's Chaca's style, he guides you Leading his friends So they don't lose their way So many know this fight is crossed Beware who you give your hand to You can get dirty I fall down, I get up I lose and I win I spit out the pain and then I stab you Blood, sweat, rage, spartan I freaked out With my brother's battle about me Black lungs, broken teeth A childhood without wanting photos Girls look at me, I can tell They're probably thinking "Look, it's the bogeyman" I want to fly and fly -To glory -I don't want to go -Through ruin I want to fly and find -My victory To leave something behind -In life I want to fly and fly -To glory -I don't want to go -Through ruin I want to fly and find -My victory To leave something behind -In life The Boy from the Blaze The Boy from the Blaze The Boy from the Blaze The one who has grown blessed! Some noise for you all that went crazy! And some noise for my little brother, Skin Fire! You can wear them either way. Let's see, try them on. Like this? They look good like that. Where are the laces for this one? Those ones look really nice. I think they look great with those fatigue pants. As long as they fit… Yes, they fit you and they look great. How do you park? You do it with the forks on the ground, okay? You never do it with the forks in the front because otherwise, you'll force the staples. The first thing you do is put the forks down, okay? This first, and then… Let's repeat the order. You first, you second, you third, you fourth, you fifth and you sixth. I think it's this way. That's perfect. Alright? Foot on the brake, okay? - How's that? Are you okay? - Yes, I'm fine. Very good. Don't forget the key. - Thank you very much. - No, man, thanks to you for coming. So, in ten days you'll have your license. Holy shit man. It was going in, dude. Where's the goalkeeper? Look at that, he doesn't care, even when he's next to him. He's lame, man. I wasn't that bad. I don't know what happened now, though. My goodness, man. I knew you were going to do that. - See? Look. - Okay. - That's it, put your arm. - Yes, sure, but… Take it easy. Relax here, you don't need this one. - That's it. - Okay, then. What a nerve, man. What's up, man? Alright then. We have a gift for you from the three of us. It's from the three of us. - Great, but I can't open it. - No, I'll open it for you, okay? What you looking at? What you looking at, man? Really? Really? Are you serious? Of course. - Like I'm responsible. - Sure, you shall take care of him. Damn, but man I'm amazed, dammit. What? Nothing, man. How can I refuse? No way. Man, if you had said no, I'd have smacked your face. I can't say no. So I'm your godfather, right? What's up, man? Of course I accept. - Thank you so much. - You'll have to take care of him. We'll see. You raise him, and I'll just play football with him. Sure. Take a photo, honey. Let's take another of the two. The last one isn't good. What? He makes funny faces, man. He has hiccups. What's up, man? That's it. Take him, you know what to do. Jesus, man. I have a godson, right? Yes. My goodness. Nice. Stay calm, okay? That's it. I parked in the back. - How you doing, man? - What's up, bro? - What time are you singing? - Around 9:00 p.m. - Or earlier? - I don't know. At 9:00 p.m. or earlier. It depends on when El Chaca starts. Look. What's up? Now, now. What are you laughing at? Yes. What's up? - He's looking at his godfather. - What's up, dude? He's looking at his godfather. - Those are the shoes I bought him? - Yes. They are cool. They're even his size. He can wear them now. - Let's see. - What did you say…? Fuck off, man! I'm gonna kick your ass, dude. Look. I'm sorry, everybody I realized my pain is not the one I prolong, but yours After all the beating, shouting and crying I'm still that kid banging his head Dreaming of conquering the world The same guy That today is screwing himself I have an armor capable of breaking hearts To protect the heart of a devil I understand you care about me I don't want you to suffer either The cold ground Freezes the fire in my soul But good memories are my firewall Loneliness dwarfs the child Who made me great Anger consumes me An unstable mind is corrupted Wound after wound, blow after blow I've learned that running is useless But I can't stand still Don't give up, I fight against myself Without any sleep Falling down, out of breath That was beautiful, sweetheart. That was so beautiful. And you don't have to apologize for anything. You don't have to ask for forgiveness. You don't have to apologize, least of all to me. Can we leave now? - Of course we can. - Come on. - Let's go. - Come on, honey. He's growing up, and he's fine. He's very well. He is doing great actually. He's fine. You'll see, he'll get better and better, okay? - Okay. - You'll see. Before we go on with the concert I'd like to invite a very special person who has been a big motivation and I'm very fond of him. He's got a lot of feelings inside and he wants to get them out. Make some noise for my man, the Boy from the Blaze! BOY FROM THE BLAZE Subtitle translation by:
