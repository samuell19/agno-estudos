(dramatic music) (gun fires) - You need both keys to be locked in. (machine buzzing) (beeping) (dramatic music) - [Man] Status. - Silo number 36 reporting, all systems normal. No incidents to report. Get my shoes polished, I'm going to a party. (dramatic music) (gun fires) (classical music) (low chattering) - Hi, how are you? Good evening. (speaking in foreign language) - Ambassador Pierce, it's a great pleasure to welcome you. - The pleasure is all mine Mr. President. To finally see an honorable man in your position, I congratulate you. - You're too kind. It is the people, not me who must have the credit. - Willmont, Mr. President, may I introduce my new deputy and security attache, George Willmont. - Pleased to meet you, Mr. President. Good party. Great grub too. - Thank you. Enjoy the party, gentlemen. (man singing in foreign language) - It's song celebrating the freedom of my people, sung by the great idol, Ivan Koselovich. - Great. Why don't we leave it that way. - Okay. - Look, can't this thing go any faster? - No, sorry, I can do nothing. - Nothing? - Nothing, this is a ration taxi car, shit! (speaking in foreign language) Oh, hello Mr. Jackson, yes, now I am thinking, I can do something. (lively instrumental music) You are wanting to maybe buy Rolex? - They're fake. - No, no fake my friend. Genuine imitation Rolex. (smacks) You are needing Visa papers, money exchange? Female companion? I have cousin, Dmitri. - Dmitri's a guy's name. - No, no my silly American friend. Dmitri is cousin arranging everything for you. (lively instrumental music) You are wanting to buy furry dice for your American car. (tires crunch) - Invitation. - Gracy, security attache. - Gracy? - Yeah. - Security is Willmont. - Willmont? No, no, Willmont is my replacement. - You go now. - Look, I'm an American, I need to see the U.S. Ambassador right away. - Wife left me for American and I look to kick American buttocks ever since. You go now. (dramatic music) - Nice gun. Nice cold sore. Let's get outta here. - Invitation is no good. Why you are not tell me the invitation is no good? I have brother in law, Achmed, who for the right price, can in just four hours-- Three hours. Two hours. One hour. Okay, plan B. (lively instrumental music) Invitation guaranteed. (speaking in foreign language) (lively instrumental music) (engine revs) (tires squeal) - Okay we're in, stop the car. (screaming) - No, no, no. - What do you mean no? - I can't stop the brakes, they don't do! - Well take your foot off the gas. - But the gas is stuck! I don't know, I can't stop! This is ration shit car! - Turn it off. - What? - Turn it off. Turn it. (screams) (engine revs) (tires squeal) (foreboding music) - [Man] Hands on the car. - Gracy! What in the hell do you think you're doing? Why aren't you stateside? - What's this all about? - I'm sure it's nothing Mr. President. I apologize for this. Now, if you will excuse me. Send the bill to the embassy. Mr. Gracy, would you please come with me right now? (dramatic music) Jack, what the hell is this all about? - Whatever it is, it can surely be said in my presence. - But Mr. President, this is a private matter. - There's been a breach. According to our traces, the launch controls at silo 36, well they've been compromised this morning. - You'll to excuse Mr. Gracy sir. He's just recently been dismissed and I can assure you that we have disconnected all of our tracers according to international treaties. - A breech? Evan, get me the Defense Minister. - Stay where you are Evan. I don't know what this man is talking about. I personally oversaw the changing of the guards at silo number 36. This morning. - Thank you Sergei. Well then, I believe this mystery has been solved. Don't you Mr. Gracy? - Yes, I believe it has. - Oh, look at the time. Gentlemen, Mr. Gracy is late for his flight back to the United States. Say goodbye Jack. - My gun please. I apologize for the disruption, Mr. President. (ominous instrumental music) - There, now it's working! You two need anything else, call me or my cousin, Nikolai Nikolovich. My American friend. I will see you later, huh. Picking you up later. Let's go boys! (clattering) - Nice work Jack. Crash a party, create an international incident, not to mention committing a felony. - You got a big mouth for a little guy. - Jack. What felony? - Section 364, paragraph two, unauthorized use of government property. That tracing unit belongs to me now. You're gonna have to answer for this. - Willmont, this has nothing to do with you at all. - But sir! - Moron. - Jack, what are you doing? Breaking in, creating panic, unloading government secrets. Christ! - What secrets Harry? You think they don't know about our tracers, come on. They're still playing the same games. Fall of the Iron Curtain didn't change anything. You know that, I know that. Even my grandmother knows that. - Even you should know it's not your job anymore, Jack. - It'll always be my job. - It's shit like this that caused you to lose it in the first place. And another thing-- - Yes? - I sure as shit am gonna miss you. - Feeling are mutual, Mr. Ambassador. Ah, sorry about the door. (plucky instrumental music) Hey, I was just kidding about your lip. (thuds) (dramatic music) (groans) (dramatic music) (steps clattering) (thuds) Ow Katie! - How dare you leave without even saying goodbye. - That hurt. Katie! Calm down. - Am I some cheap conquest. - Katie calm down, you know what happens when you get mad. Now, it's not what you're thinking. - Oh no? - No. - And what exactly was I supposed to think, Jack? - Sweetheart, sweetheart, I was gonna make it up to you, I promise. - Really, let me guess, with flowers? - Yes. - And a note explaining everything. - Yeah, and a ticket to join me for two weeks in beautiful Bahamas sweetheart. Just you and me. - You told me you hate the Bahamas. - You know, sometimes people, they change their minds right? All right, I give up, I give up. (dramatic music) (sweet instrumental music) (soft laughing) (speaking in foreign language) - American bastard. State your business. - You don't read? Catering. - Well, the reception started two hours ago. - Relax, this is Soviet Union. - Bazrakhistan. Get out. I need to check the back. - Whatever you say. (thuds) (groans) (ominous music) (gun fires) (clapping) (dramatic music) (clapping) - Thank you, thank you. For much too long, many of us here today have been separated from each other. Be it the Iron Curtain, the bars of a prison cell, or the rigid confines of an ideology. I say the time is now that we come together to build a foundation of trust and cooperation. To reach out in peace and friendship. To set our sights on a better tomorrow. (gun fires) (groans) To establish a structure of civility and mutual understanding and wipe the shame from the souls of our people. (man groaning) We should find ourselves surrounded with friendship and love. It is my profound belief that from this day forward we should present ourselves to the world as kind and gentler, revealing our true intentions and ridding ourselves once and for all, of all pretense and disguise that prevents us from being honest and showing the world who we really are, that we may live together in peace and in tolerance in our new democratic republic of Bazrakhistan. (crowd clapping) - Kate? Where you going hon? - I'm missing my father's speech. - That's not the reason why you're leaving. - It was a nice goodbye. (sad instrumental music) I believe you know the way out. (audience clapping) - And now our esteemed Vice President, Vassily Krutov. (audience clapping) - President Mirovich has already spoken eloquently about our country's recent political changes. So let me not digress and simply add that our political changes continue. In fact, at this very moment, ladies and gentlemen, the leadership in this country will again be changing hands. (dramatic music) (yelling) - Krutov, how could you? (dramatic music) I trusted you both. - Take this criminal down to the mines. Take them all down there. - Krutov! I demand a word with you! - Oh, Mr. Ambassador, what do you want? - Mr. Krutov, do you realize you are in violation of your country's constitution and international law? - Is that so? - I demand-- (gun fires) (dramatic music) (crowd clattering) - Mr. Willmont. Do you have any demands? (dramatic music) (light instrumental music) (man screaming) - [Man] Shut up! (dramatic music) (thuds) (ominous instrumental music) - What's going on? (speaking in foreign language) (thuds) I know what that meant. (dramatic music) (people clattering) - [Man] Get going! (dramatic music) (people groaning and clambering) (dramatic music) (somber instrumental music) - Premature to be celebrating, don't you think? - You can relax now, Sergei, the coup went perfectly. - We're not finished yet. The access disc comes first. Without it you couldn't launch a single missile if you had to. - Take it easy, Sergei. We are taking care of it right now, come on. (thuds) (low ominous music) - This man's spent half his life in the gulag. He won't divulge a thing. - In the gulag he didn't have to answer to me. (ominous music) Tell me where it is. (smacks) - Put an end to this Krutov. - I'll put an end to you. (smacks) Okay. (dramatic music) (thuds) - What brawn won't solve, beauty will. (dramatic music) - [Branford] Special Services, Branford speaking. - This is agent Gracy. I have a level three emergency. - [Branford] Whoa, agent Gracy, you're not calling on an authorized line. - Yeah, well I don't have the choice right now. There's been a hostile coup in Bazrakhistan. Our ambassador's been killed. - [Branford] ID please. - 679346562 six. - [Branford] Mr. Gracy, your number is no longer valid. - Look, I'm telling you, I am in the middle of a hostile coup. I don't have time to explain right now. - [Branford] You're not authorized to report here to begin with, Mr. Gracy. - Screw your classifications. Get me Commander Kelly right now. - [Branford] I'm not going to do that. Now, you know better than to bother us. - Look, I'm not asking for donation dammit! I'm telling you there's been a coup! - [Branford] If you would like to report any irregularities in Bazrakhistan, you'll have to follow proper procedure. - What? - [Branford] File a report with the ambassador. - He's dead you moron! - [Branford] Not according to our intelligence. - I'm giving you intelligence now! - [Branford] You, Mr. Gracy, are not authorized to report intelligence. Good bye. - Wait, wait! (dial tone buzzing) (clattering) - Katherina. I will never betray our people. - Shameless cowards. - You must be very proud of your daughter. Young, intelligent, beautiful. Full of life. How quickly all that can change. (dramatic music) - Don't tell them anything, don't. - A wise man once wrote we can conquer violence with peace, overcome brutality with reason. Why don't you follow your own advice and be reasonable? - No, no! - Katherina's bedroom. In the floor. There is a safe. It is in there. - [Sergei] And the combination? - 61 26. - Ax, take her away but keep her separate. (crying) At least until we're sure the old man's told us the truth. (feet clattering) (suspenseful music) (plucky instrumental music) - [Woman] 61, 42, 26. (dramatic music) (laughing) - We've done it Sergei! - Control yourself, we've done nothing yet. Take this to the control center and have Nubo initiate the launch sequence. (ominous instrumental music) - Soon we will celebrate. (ball clattering) (man speaking in foreign language) - Ah, there it is. (man speaking in foreign language) Yeah, whatever. I'll just take the ball and leave, thank you. (thuds) (dramatic music) What's going on here? What's the target? (man speaking in foreign language) English! What's the target? - After don't know. I just run the system. (dramatic music) (grunting) - What's happening? (foreboding instrumental music) - Clear the compound and start a complete search. Kill the intruder and get me that disc. In the meantime, we proceed according to schedule. - Without the disc? - That's not important just yet. Krutov can still threaten without it. (dramatic music) (gun fires) (dramatic music) - He's in there! (gun fires) (dramatic music) - [Man] I'll stay here to get the disc when the body surfaces. (ominous instrumental music) - Where is the U.S. Ambassador? - You shot him. - Ah, right. You'll have to do. With the power invested in me, blah, blah, blah, blah. I promote you to U.S. Ambassador. Any objections? Good. Now, contact your government. Tell them we must negotiate. (ominous instrumental music) - [Branford] Special Services, Branford speaking. - This is Willmont, sector Bazrakhistan, give me Commander Kelly. - [Branford] Bazrakhistan not again, listen-- - This is Willmont, ID 679723203A/2. Now get me Kelly. (ominous instrumental music) - [Kelly] Kelly here. What the hell's going on over there, Willmont? - This is Vassily Krutov. Our former president's crimes against the people have forced me to take emergency control of democratic Bazrakhistan. - This is Willmont, I witnessed the transfer. - [Kelly] Where's Ambassador Pierce? - He's dead. During the confusion of the take over-- Of the liberation, he was accidentally killed by a palace guard. - [Kelly] I see. What exactly does Mr. Krutov want? - I want you to orchestrate swift and complete international recognition of my government. My country is currently unstable. These measures will help me bring prosperity to my people. - [Kelly] I understand your concerns, Mr. Krutov, but there are international rules to be considered and your request is rather complicated. - Commander Kelly, did I forget to mention that I'm in control of my country's nuclear weapons? Tell him, Willmont. - It's true, sir. - Of course, I would never use them Commander Kelly. But one never knows. - [Kelly] I understand completely Mr. Krutov. - President Krutov. And understand this, we also have a palace full of guests, I'm sure you wouldn't want any harm to come. - [Kelly] Of course, Mr. President. - Don't try anything stupid. You know, my country's a peace-loving nation. If my demands seem severe, it is only because my people desperately desire peace. - [Kelly] Of course sir. - Who knows, maybe someday your president and I can even share a drink. - [Kelly] Yes, I don't see why not. - You have six hours. Peace cannot wait. - [Kelly] We'll get on it immediately. - Good and I hope for your sake, you contact us again shortly. - [Kelly] We definitely will, Mr. President. - Vassily Ivonovitch Krutov. A compromised member of Mirovich's government. He spent time in the gulags. We suspect, not so much for his political views, as for legitimate concerns for his psychological state. - We can bomb the palace and wipe this bastard out in 15 minutes. - Are you nuts? Kill hundreds of innocent people, risk starting a war? - There won't be any war once we get rid of this wacko! - Fuck him, he's bluffing. - May I remind you that they have 30 nuclear missile installations? - You want to mess with that? - That's why we have to get rid of him! - Or use diplomacy to bring him inline. Krutov is displaying typical post-coup anxiety. This man is obviously just posturing. - You're fucking posturing. I say we blast this fruit to fucking smithereens! - [Ellen] Aren't you the voice of reason. - Why not use a ranger commando team. Conduct a surgical strike, wipe out Krutov, restore Mirovich and tomorrow this is all history. - And if it fails, the president's ratings are history. Remember Jimmy Carter in Iran. - Will you fuck politics for once. We're sitting around here with our thumbs up our asses while some psycho's got his finger on the button! - He's right. Keeping Krutov around is a huge risk! - Yeah, and what better way to bring him over the edge than a failed raid. Diplomacy, gentlemen. - No diplomacy for a terrorist! - This is an act of war! I say we nail him! - The President will not approve. Last week the President pressured Congress to clear 50 million dollars in financial aid to Bazrakhistan. Imagine how they'll react when they find out the president gave the money to a maniac dictator. - Can we at least authorize a stand by mobilization? - Well, I don't like it. These things always get out of hand. - Ellen, it's only a stand by. Our boys are two hours away in Turkey right now. We fly 'em in on a holding pattern, we buy the president some time for damage control. If anything changes, we go in. - If it came down to it, a late reaction would look bad but promise me it's only a stand by. No gung ho. (dramatic music) - All right gentlemen we are on stand by. - Did you kill the intruder? - He's dead, shot and drowned. - And the disc? - The body never surfaced. (dramatic music) - Willmont, get out but don't stray too far. We still may require your services. - I'll advise the president to approve our decision. - And the Kremlin, I'm sure they're as worried about this wacko as we are. - My gut still tells me that this whole thing is some sort of awkward bluff. - If it is, Krutov bluffed his way into a body bag. - They will not forget me, Sergei. - Indeed. (dramatic music) (gun fires) History will not forget you. Get this sorry waste of vodka out of here. (ominous music) - You got something to celebrate Willmont? - Gracy. What are you doing here? - Maybe I should be asking you the same question. Where's Katherina? - They're keeping her in a separate cell down below. - Why'd they let you go? - I'm up here negotiating. - These guys don't want to negotiate. They're assassins. Look, why don't you come with me. - Are you crazy! I'm in the middle of delicate talks, all right. - Talks? These guys don't want to talk. - So far I've kept them from launching the nuclear weapons. - They're not gonna launch jack, not without this. - Holy shit. Look Jack I-- I think it's best if you give that back Jack. - What? - If they have that, none of this would be happening right now. - If they had it they'd be nuclear right now. - I order you not to meddle in this, Jack. I'm in charge here-- - You order me? Your job was to protect Pierce, not take his place. You're pathetic. (dramatic music) - Where you going? Jack don't fuck this up! (ominous music) - Fine. (dramatic music) (screams) (dramatic music) - Jack! (dramatic music) (speaking in foreign language) - What did he say? - Drop the gun or he'll kill me. (speaking in foreign language) No? - Kate, don't argue with me now, just tell him I said no okay. Just tell him I said no! (thuds) (dramatic music) Kate get out. No, not the gun, you wanna kill me? (thuds) (dramatic music) (chains jangling) (thuds) (dramatic music) (clattering) (dramatic music) (thuds) (ominous music) (groans) (ominous music) - Jack. - Let's go. - [Branford] Special Services, Branford speaking. Hello? - Branford, I told you about him, ask for Commander Kelly. Tell him who you are. - May I speak to Commander Kelly? - [Branford] Who is this? - This is Katherina Mirova, daughter of the president of Bazrakhistan. - [Branford] Just a moment, Mr. Mirova. - [Kelly] This is Commander Kelly. - You're a hard man to get a hold of, Commander. - [Kelly] Gracy? - Speaking to you live from Bazrakhistan, sir. - [Kelly] I heard you called earlier. I thought you'd be out of there by now. What have you started this time? - Well, we have a hostile military coup, sir and I guarantee you I had nothing to do with it. - [Kelly] We know it. Willmont contacted us. - Willmont's in over his head, sir. These guys mean business, but they're not gonna be able to do anything. I've got the launch access disc. - [Kelly] Shit. They were bluffing? Are you sure that thing's not-- - He thinks I'm lying. 100% sir, the president's daughter's sitting right next to me. - [Kelly] You tell her that we have a commando force ready to move in to restore her father's government. Now since they can't launch, I think our rangers will have a great night. Exactly 30 minutes. Jack listen, your ass is not too popular around here, considering you just got canned. So let me assure you that your participation in this matter will not be welcome. - Yeah, well I hope you don't just expect me to sit around-- - [Kelly] Hold on. I didn't say I was of that popular opinion. - So anything I can do to screw them up you're all for it, sir? - [Kelly] Yes, but don't step on any toes. You copy? - I copy. - [Kelly] Good, now don't be surprised when the boys come knockin'. Oh and Jack? - Sir? - [Kelly] Welcome back. - Green light gentlemen, we are good to go. (dramatic music) (helicopters whooshing) - We need to talk. Where's President Krutov? - President's term has ended. What do you want? - I know that you don't have the disc. And I know where it is. - Where? - Okay look, I don't give a flying fuck who's in charge of this shit hole. Okay, no offense, I just want to get outta here alive. - Of course. - Okay. Here's the deal, I'll get you that disc but you gotta loosen up the purse strings a little bit, if you know what I mean. - You want money. (laughs) - Don't act so surprised, Serg. After all, isn't that what this is all about? Presidency is gonna make you awful rich. I just want a little piece of that. - Where is it? - It's around. Somewhere. (ominous music) Okay look, there's no need to get desperate here, all right. You've come this far, why kill your only chance of getting that disc? - Can you duck as fast as you talk? - Okay look, it's with a friend of mine, Jack Gracy. He trusts me. I'll find him and I'll get you that disc, okay? (dramatic music) - Here's the deal, find me that disc and you'll get your pot of gold. Fail me, I will kill you. (ominous music) - Look at me Katie, these rangers are the best that we have and if anybody can get us out of here it's them okay? You keep your chin up. - Jack? Why won't you tell me why you were really leaving. - Not right now. - But what if something happens? - Nothing's going to happen. - Don't walk away from me, I need to know. - No, you don't need to know! (somber instrumental music) Katie, Katie. Sorry, Katie. Look honey, a few months ago I was sent to track some new drug routes that were merging across the former Soviet Union. I discovered a processing station that was the last stop for the Asian drugs before they headed west. They were also using children as carriers. - Is this still going on? - No, because last week I tracked down the son of a bitch that was running the operation and I decided to put him out of business. Well, it turned out that this asshole was an arms smuggler who was working with a covert unit of ours, he was on our payroll. They decided that he was an integral member of our intelligence community. - Your superiors were angry. - Yeah, they were pissed off big time and to cover their asses they had me removed for insubordination and that's the end of the story. - So now you go back to Chicago to be a policeman. - I don't think so. They had a problem with my insubordination too. We got work to do. (ominous music) - Jack, through here. (gasps) (ominous music) Constantine, he wants to be president. - No, he's not the presidential type. He's got something else going on, Katie. - Mr. Gracy, Mr. Jack Gracy. We know you're here and we know what you have. I want it back. Now, you may want to play this little cat and mouse game but I haven't the time. I prefer to get right down to business. Surrender now. If you fail to comply, the other guests will be forced to bear the consequences with their lives. Don't allow these needless deaths to happen, Mr. Gracy. Executions begin in three minutes. President Mirovich will be first. - It's a trap. I better get down there. - But giving him the disc could cost millions of lives. - He's not gonna get the disc. - And my father? - Your father's gonna be okay. Everything's gonna work out. - He'll come, but not with the disc. He'll want to negotiate, demand that I free the hostages. Two minutes, Mr. Gracy. - Katie, I'm gonna go down. I'm gonna negotiate with him. I'm gonna demand that he frees all of the hostages. Now, he's gonna agree with me but he's gonna have something else up his sleeve. Constantine, he's not gonna know that I'm on to him, but he can't expect me to believe that he's gonna let all those people go. - On the other hand, Mr. Gracy will probably be expecting us to double cross him. Doesn't matter. Luring him here is a no-lose situation. Eventually he'll break. Time is on our side. - All I have to do is let him think that he's getting the upper hand, then stall him until the rangers get here. Time, it's on our side. - [Constantine] 30 seconds, Mr. Gracy. - Come on. (dramatic music) I want you to go into your room and stay there. Here's the disc, take care of it. - Be careful. - I'm afraid we'll have to kill the old sop after all. (dramatic music) - Don't move. Willmont, thank God it's you. - You don't know how good it is to see you, too. (dramatic music) - Not you too. - It's always better to be on the winning team, wouldn't you say? - You're really a bastard, you know that Willmont? - That's rich bastard to you. - Five seconds, four seconds, three seconds, two seconds. - [Jack] Hold your fire. - Mr. Gracy, so glad you could join us. (dramatic music) Did you bring the disc? - Release the hostages, all of them. Then you'll get your disc. - How do I know you'll give it to me if I release them? - How do I know you won't kill them all after I do? Free them first or we're done talking. - How cute, Mr. Gracy, a stand off. - No it's not. - Ah. - Father! - Excellent Willmont. - I aim to serve. - You aim to die. (dramatic music) (gun fires) I do hate traitors. Prepare the command center. Now, where was I? Ah yes, executions. - What the hell's this all about, Constantine? You don't give a shit about politics. - For money, Mr. Gracy. Even Willmont knew that. - That's why you killed Krutov? You used him as your pawn. - To enable daring heist. You see Mr. Gracy, when the U.S. decides to bomb this palace, I'll be quietly departing with the contents of our national treasury. 50 million dollars in foreign aid, provided so generously by your own country, I might add. - Everybody will be so relieved to have Krutov out of the way, nobody's even gonna suspect a heist. (dramatic music) - An ingenious plan, don't you think? - It's not bad, for a petty thief. - Greed is good. You Americans don't understand. Now I will teach you thing. - American troopers, drop your weapons! (thuds) Everybody on the ground! (gun fires) Go go! (dramatic music) (gun fires) - [Man] Come on, move, move, move! - [Man] We're on ground. Encountering limited resistance, over. - First wave is in. Second wave is on the way. - I'll inform the president and the Kremlin. (dramatic music) (helicopter whooshing) - Gentlemen, lock and load. (guns clacking) (dramatic music) (booming) - [Man] Dammit! (dramatic music) - Looks like the second wave didn't make it. - Guess not. - Jack, father's hurt. - All right, let's get to safe place, that way. (ominous music) (dramatic music) - Prepare a launch. - What? - If they think they can end it with a raid, they're wrong. Access a nuclear launch, now! (dramatic music) (gun fires) (grunts) (dramatic music) (thuds) - I'm an American, on the same side! - Hold it right there. - I'm special agent Gracy. Look, they're getting ready to launch. The command center's downstairs. I'm gonna take out the dish on the roof, okay. - Who do you report to? - Kelly! - Shit! Gracy, here. - Hooah. - [Man] Brooklyn, where the hell are you? - Off stage, Falcon. - [Man] What's the problem? - Just a little tango with a friendly agent man. - Dammit! - That's your man, Kelly. (dramatic music) (gun fires) - [Constantine] Yes. (dramatic music) (grunting) - Silo number. - 36. (thuds) (grunts) Set target coordinates at 38 degrees 55 minutes by 77 degrees. (dramatic music) Fabulous. Yes. (beeping) (thuds) (grunts) (dramatic music) (booming) (alarm beeping) What's the problem? (clacking) (ominous music) (alarm beeping) (gun fires) (dramatic music) (beeping) (static blares) - What the hell happened? - We've been cut off. - [Kelly] We'll receiving the homing signal from the helicopter. This interference is starting to signify a serious breech. - Could also mean they've been shot to hell. I'm operating option two to stand by. - Bomb the palace? - It's stand by dammit! (dramatic music) - This American intrusion is becoming an annoyance. It's time to commandeer the remaining helicopter and initiate our escape plan. - Should we go under guard? - Of course. (static blaring) (dramatic music) - [Woman] We have the American wings. - Good, fire it up, I'll be joining you shortly. (computer beeping) (dramatic music) (beeping) (ominous music) (boxes clacking) - This gold is heavy. We'll never be able to lift off. - Who said anything about we? (gun fires) (beeping) (dramatic music) - Constantine! (dramatic music) (gun fires) (helicopter whirring) - [Constantine] Come on, up! - Shit. (dramatic music) - What heading? - Navigate according to my instructions. We'll use the guidance system to transmit the launch command. - Nice, very nice. - Activate radar system. - Radar system activated. - Sir, we're detecting another launch attempt. - That does it, I'm implementing option two. - Dammit, we can't be-- - No. What we can't do is come out of this looking like fools. Now, I'm gonna do what I shoulda done in the first place, cream the fucking palace! We cannot put off first strike any longer. Launch the burst. (dramatic music) (booming) - Increase altitude seven meters. (whooshing) Coordinates five degrees south west. Rotate off the grid. Rotate five degrees. Hold. (dramatic music) (alarm blaring) (clattering) (helicopter whirring) (booms) (dramatic music) (ominous music) - I've got an incoming call from the palace in Bazrakhistan. - Must have more demands. - No, it's Gracy, I'll put him through. - Don't tell him anything. Gracy's a front. - Look, the rangers didn't make it, Gracy did so shut up and let me speak. Gracy. - It's all over, Commander. - Listen up Gracy, you got three cruise missiles honing in on you right now. Impact in 9.02. - Nine minutes. Get back down to the mine, make sure everyone gets out. Go on. (dramatic music) Let me guess Commander, you can't stop it. - Impossible, commands are locked. - Jack, get the hell outta there. (dramatic music) (beeping) (whooshing) (dramatic music) - Give it up, Constantine, it's over. - Problem is, I've never been a good loser. That palace is going to be destroyed. Why don't I take you with me? - Why not take me? (dramatic music) - Ah yes, the American intrusion, it never ends, does it? Drop your gun. - Okay, let them go. It's me you really want, isn't it? (speaking in foreign language) - Mr. President, kindly escort your lovely daughter to safety. - Go on, Kate, get out of here. (dramatic music) - But Jack. - Go on, go! - All right Mr. Gracy, upstairs. It's time for the fireworks. (thuds) (dramatic music) (grunts) (water splashing) (dramatic music) (water splashing) (grunting) (dramatic music) - Come on. (thuds) (dramatic music) (thuds) (grunting) (dramatic music) - This mine was built in the 1800s. It could never withstand the force of a modern weapon. We can't possibly stay here. Don't worry, don't worry, we'll manage somehow. Any ideas? (dramatic music) (water splashing) (gun fires) - The lower shafts, they'll lead up up, come! Through here, come, come! (water splashing) (grunting) (dramatic music) (clattering) (grunting) (dramatic music) - [Man] Come on, this way. (dark music) (beeping) (dramatic music) (booms) (beeping) (men cheering) - We just killed over a dozen innocent people. - We'll get the right spin on this. Call it a limited success. - Look, the important thing is we're all safe. Americans'll sleep better knowing there's one less maniac to worry about. - Thanks to Gracy. I'm gonna give him a medal. - Better make it posthumous. (singing in foreign language) - Is that the Imperial Palace? - I'm afraid it was. - And my American friend, did he? (sad instrumental music) I was supposed to deliver this for him. You see, I have cousin Yitzak in delivery business. - It's for you. - He never was a good liar. (cheering and clapping) (horn blaring) - American, American! (sweeping instrumental music) - I see you got my ticket to Acapulco. - You told me it was for the Bahamas. - Ah, never was a good liar, Kate. - You jerk! - Hey! - That's no way to treat a national hero. - Yeah, you listen to your father. - You saved our lives, Mr. Gracy, thank you. - Glad I could be of service, sir. - Too bad about the palace. You need new building? I have brother-in-law. (sweeping instrumental music)
