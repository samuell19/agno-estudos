- Mongolia is a drinking country. [guitar music] I was there for two years with the Peace Corp. ♪ Marry me, marry me, you will see ♪ I am born at the hand of a wise and foolish God ♪ Wish, wish, wish upon a star ♪ How far will we go - Hey. Hey. What's up, I didn't know it was you. Just reading, relaxing. I listened to all your CD's this morning. - I had been working in the city for over a year in a film school, the director of the school had been embezzling money, so it closed down and I needed to get another job. It was the end of the second summer I was there and I was about to head out to the countryside to an elementary school. - I'm really getting attached to your bed. Every time you, whenever you leave in the morning, I crawl off the couch and I come and I sleep in here until about noon. It's great, it's really nice except your dad loves to garden I think at like 8 in the morning or something. It's throwing me off. - When I was 16 years old, I met the woman I thought one day would be my wife. - So I was leaving my apartment couple days before I was to leave the city entirely, on my way over to some neighbor's house. And it was about 5 o'clock, 5:30. I was walking towards their house and a shortcut was in this alleyway between a very large building and an unfinished wrestling stadium. - So what? I know. Well, I thought you said til the end of the month. - So I'm at this retreat and the ratio of girls to guys there was probably seven girls to every guy. So there was a dance at the end of the week, and I'm thinking, once it came time for this dance that I was going to ask someone to dance. I was going to do something with that kind of ratio. The odds were in my favor. - A lot of people were milling about doing their shopping for the day. - Monique, I thought you said til the end of the month. Well, where do you expect me to go? - [speaking Mongolian] So over and over again, I'm sorry, I'm drunk. I just wanna talk, just listen to me for a little bit. And after about 50 of these kind of people, you've heard basically the script, I don't know. ♪ I'm not normal ♪ Dances are we won't go far ♪ Let's fall in love - Needless to say after the next few months, we started dating and it continued on and on for the next about 3 years into it. And we had lived together for a time, we're full expecting just to stay together and everything. We had a few problems here and there, in life a few things you have to deal with, it's normal in any relationship. But what was to come in the future was something that I wasn't expecting I'd ever have to deal with. And that I would never want anyone else to deal with. - I should put in context. You know, after dealing with these people for a whole year, and after the whole thing with the school and all the frustrations, you know, I put so much aside, I'd been so patient for so long. I'd been constantly understanding, okay, it's difficult. It's a third world country, they have a lot of problems, they're developing, blah blah blah. - I was at work one day and I got a phone call. And the manager just called me over and said, "Dave, line one." So I picked it up and all I heard was a voice that was kind of crackling and crying a little and it was her. And I just said, "What's wrong?" And she said, "I need you to come to the hospital." And I said, "I'm at work, I can't just get up and leave." - I got... I don't have any money. You know I'm looking for a job. What do you... That's bullshit. - Whole summer long, I've just been, just snapping, every now and then. Arguments, little problems, didn't have patience, blew up with some other foreigners in town, arguments and stuff. But I'd never been in a fight, never got in a fight my entire life. ♪ You said we had it out on me ♪ We taste the world, it tastes like meat ♪ And some day soon it will all end ♪ - And I didn't really know what to think, I just said, "What happened? What's wrong? Please tell me." And she said, "Dave, I've been raped." And I said, "By whom?" It was my first thought. I had never experienced that much instantaneous anger in my life. ♪ What the hell do you mean? ♪ Here it comes - I saw this drunk and I went [sighs] and I just walked away. Well, he saw this, I didn't realize he could. He was a ways off. And a moment later I felt this very large smack in my shoulder. And I look down, there's a big rock, it just hit me in the shoulder. I turned around, startled, and I saw the guy looking at me. [speaking Mongolian] - And she said, "Please just come to the hospital." And I yelled back, "By whom?" And she just said it was Joe. Well, Joe was her roommate's boyfriend. Now, I'd never met this guy before. I didn't know what he looked like or anything about him. But I just said, "Where is he?" And she wouldn't tell me. She wanted me to be with her. She didn't want me to do anything rash at the time. - I was furious, you know? This guy just wanted it so bad. And so I went toward him. I just marched across the field between us. And shouted out to him [speaking Mongolian]. What did you throw a rock at me for? I don't even know you. What is your problem? And this man is standing next to him like, you don't wanna do this, you don't wanna do this. But I did. - I mean, am I not clean enough for you? You know it's not easy... Coming from one coast to another. I just need two more weeks. What, is it the sign? Is it the sign? Because I can't take it out right now. - I still had that feeling inside of, I guess call it rage or whatever. But I wanted to get my hands on the guy who'd done this. I think anybody would've felt the same way. But she wouldn't even tell me his last name. I had no idea where to find him or what to do. But she was more interested in protecting me and making sure that I didn't do anything stupid than she was in her own health and safety at the time. - I got close to him, I did the little, you know, last minute evasive action, but he caught onto my sweater sleeve and I couldn't shake him off. And so I just blew and I started hitting him in the head. And when I'm hitting him, his head's popping back like I'm hitting him, well, like I was hitting him very hard. It looked like... I was surprised. I remember again that thought train in the background, sort of disconnected from reality. I remember thinking, "Hey, it looks just like a fight scene in a Hollywood movie, whoa." - Well... I was really really counting on you. And this is just fucked. - For a year or two afterwards, it was something that was always hanging over us and always hanging over me. Something I wanted to remedy, but I didn't know how. There was only one time that I actually came face to face with him. And it was when I was moving her out of her apartment. And she got out of there pretty much right away. As I was moving things out, I was carrying... It was an old antique television, 27 inch screen, but it had a huge wood box, thing must've weighted at least 100 pounds if not more. And I was so enraged at just being in her apartment where it happened. I was lifting this thing up by myself, and as I was walking out the door, he passed me going inside the door. And all I did was looked at him and I said, "You better run." And right then, she grabbed me, held me and said, forget it. Drug me into the car said, "We're leaving, we're getting out of here." And I never got a chance to go back in that apartment. - You're putting... Where do you think I'm gonna go? Where do you think I'm gonna go? I'm gonna walk down the street and not know where the fuck I'm gonna go. - I remember the sound that his head was making when I was hitting it. They really have it right in the movies. It makes this watermelon crunching sound. I think back and there's always mixed feelings. I could've tried to get away, maybe he could've thrown another rock at me. If he had hit me in the head with that rock to begin with, I could've been totally brained. But having never been in a fight before, and having always tried to avoid it, I still feel this tremendous satisfaction with finally striking out and finally telling someone "Fuck you." - So I pick it up with my foot, I look in, and I can see glass all over our living room floor. I'm just about to go through and investigate, and from the right hand side behind the door this big bloody fucking hand shoots out and says "Come and get me, come and get me." And I'm like, "No, I don't think so." And I jumped back and I bailed into the bathroom as quick as I could. And as I was turning, I saw the two people from downstairs, they didn't see the hand because it was right between my face and him. And so they're still standing there in terror, What's going on? Why has he ditched us? So I close the door to the bathroom. I don't know if this guy is armed, I don't know what's going on. There's just blood, there's somebody in my house. There's glass everywhere. So I scream at them through the door. "Get out of here, call 911, call 911, get out of here." And so I hear, they're slamming the door. Now I'm in this bathroom with nothing but a little rinky little lock things in the door. I'm in this little 6 foot by 8 foot space. There's one door, one door that leads to this guy with his bloody hand. And then there's another, there's this window that goes to this light wall, the same light wall that was that I share with my room. So I figure that it's better to bail out the window than to sit in here in this bathroom not knowing what's gonna happen. With only this little chain thing holding the door. So I open the window, and I clamber down this, down all these pipes and stuff to the floor down below. And the roommates, they see me knocking at the window. And their eyes are huge. Like what the hell is going on? Now there's this guy outside the window banging. So they open the window for me and let me through, and somebody's luckily on the phone calling the police. Well, the police showed up probably couple minutes later to five minutes later. And they go through, they kick down doors. They go up into my house and tear the whole place apart. Can't find the guy. So they go around the back of the house and find that he's passed out in a pool of blood back behind the house. And they tried and roused him and try and drag him out of the back and he puts up a fight. And the next thing I saw was, I'm out front of the house, there's all these cop cars, paddy wagons, all this stuff. They drag this guy out from the back. And these are big fucking SFPD guys and there's four of them dragging this one guy out. He's kicking and screaming, spitting at them. Just saying, "You're not my fucking father, get your hands off me." And I'm just like oh my god. And they throw him in the back of this truck and slammed the door shut. And this big cop, he's kind of laughing, "Jesus Christ." And I say, "Is he on drugs or something? What's up?" He goes, "Oh, man, he's definitely on something. Because it took four of us plus two cans of pepper spray just to get him to calm down." And that was the calmest they had gotten him. - Yeah, well. Yeah, well. I'm out of... You won't even see me when you come home, so don't worry about it, okay? [rhythmic music] [foreign music] - Well, I've been seeing this woman for about 2, 2 and a half years, and we had this mutual friend. - So I'm friends with this guy who's a roofer and he has a friend who is a roofer with him. And one night, he was like, "Let's go over to this guy Wa's house and see what's going on with Wa." [foreign music] - Dave came from the east coast. He's a artist and musician. Both of us thought he was the shit. - So we get there and this guy comes out on the porch and he's like really so tough. Just so tough that you can't even believe. So then I find out later that he's been banned from most of the local bars because he is, he gets into fights and nearly kills people. - In the meantime, my girlfriend of 2 and a half years decided that she was not into me any longer. And she broke up with me. But we're still sleeping in the bed together every night. [rhythmic music] - He comes out and he's got this scar on his face that is like, it goes all the way down his face. Like through his lip, down his face. And then later that night he tells me that when the chainsaw bumped back in his face, it tore through the sinus cavity and he's got a plate here and plate here. I mean, it was pretty crazy. He's really brutal. So anyway, I start realizing that this woman that is his girlfriend is a police officer. - Needless to say, she started seeing my friend Dave from the east coast. And they started fucking. I could do nothing about it. I knew they were doing it, but they wouldn't admit it to me. I asked him to his face, "Are you having sex with my ex-girlfriend? My pseudo ex-girlfriend?" - So I think to myself, "That's a little bit crazy." there's like some sort of illegal dealings, not too bad, but having to do with a pig. I'm like, I'm not normally friends with pigs. So this is a little bit uncomfortable for me. [rhythmic music] - I shouldn't have believed him. I didn't believe him. I should've just smacked him upside his head, but I didn't. I should've kicked them both out on their asses on the streets, but instead, I hung my head, put my tail between my legs and left. [rhythmic music] - What are you doing here? - [David] Hmm? - What are you doing here? - [David] I'm sleeping. - Why are you sleeping here? - [David] I don't have anywhere else to sleep. - All the other people that don't have a place to sleep sleep on our roof. - [David] On the roof? - Yeah. - [David] How do they get there? - The fire escape. - [David] Oh, okay. Thanks. - You're welcome. - Hi. - You must be David. - Yeah, yeah, I'm David. - Why did you come up the fire escape? - Why did... It's a good question, actually the front door was locked. - Oh. I have your keys downstairs. - You have the keys. - [Woman] Yeah. - Yeah, let me in. Can you take this? Cool. Thanks. - Hurry up. - Be cool. - Did you see the size of the sign on that guy? - He had a very large sign. - Dude, I think that's the Dave. - It's the Dave, dude. - I think the Daves are moving in. - That sign. That sign could be well hung. - The Dave is moving in. The Bill is out, dude. Ex-nay on the Bill. - The Bill was not cool. - The Bill was not cool, dude. He sucked ass. - Okay, dude, let's go. - [David] All right, yeah. Well, you know, it's just. I do that all the time. It's so hard to find a place to live. - [Shannon] 15? - Oh, yeah, 15. - You've seen it. - Yeah, I have seen this one. - Yeah, okay. - I've seen this one. - So I'm just gonna go into my apartment to get... - Okay, all right. Hi, who are you? - I'm Maya. - You're Maya? Maya with a Y? - Yeah. - You live here? - Yeah. - Okay, will I see you today or tomorrow? - Maybe today or tomorrow. - Maybe today or tomorrow, okay. All right. - [Maya] Bye. - Bye, Maya. She's cute. - Yeah. Oh, careful. - There we go. Yes, well. Yeah, that looks my place. Maya, can you open your door a little bit? There we go, thanks. Bye. - [Maya] Bye. - [David] All right. Thank you, bye. - Yeah, bye. Right here, next apartment down. - There? So if I need like flour or vanilla... - Whatever, just knock. - Okay, all right, bye. - Bye, bye. - Bye. - [Maya] Bye. [bass music playing] - Nice. - A couple of summers ago, must've been a junior in college. And I was on summer vacation with my good friend Ezra. And we were visiting my home in upstate New York. Spent about a week together, his girlfriend was working at a camp nearby, so we'd hang out there. And we decided one day to spend an afternoon in Woodstock, New York, which was old stomping grounds for me, it's a quaint little cultural town. And we figured we'd just go there for the afternoon, catch some dinner, have a good time. And so we get to the town, we park the car, and we go off into the woods a little ways behind this parking lot that I was familiar with. And we decided we'll get stoned, just wander around town for the afternoon. And we're in the midst of rolling a joint, and we light the end of it, I take a few drags, pass it to Ezra, Ezra takes a few hits. And suddenly he says to me to put it out. I thought he was joking so I just took another hit. He says, "Seriously, put it out. There's a cop behind you." I was like whatever. And I turn around and sure enough there's this mountain police Woodstock bike officer right behind me. And he's caught us red handed with a lit marijuana cigarette. And a small dime of weed. And we immediately are being taken downtown. He's calling another cop to have the cop car come, he's booking us, he's cuffing us, he's putting us in the back seat of the car. Ezra and I are pretty shocked by this. It's the first time we've ever been arrested, and don't have the mercy of the law. I made some attempts to talk my way out of the situation, saying that I was a regular around town. That I'd gone to high school with some people, just trying to get out of it and the cop wasn't hearing me. And next thing, we're driving through downtown Woodstock heading towards the police department. The cop's on the radio, he's oggling some tourist girl with big breasts. And the cop on the other car is turning around, making a u-turn to check out the girl he's talking about. Just some typical cop behavior. But I guess friendly. We get to the station and they begin to search our clothing. And they had me... they book me. They finger printed me and they had me stand in a cell. And then the cop, while he was putting rubber gloves on, asked me to undress. So I was getting pretty freaked out at this point. I've seen my movies and heard my stories. And heard stories about anal probes and what not. I was getting pretty terrified as he put these gloves on. He's asking me to undress. So I undress and he asked me to take off my pants, I take off my pants. He asked me to remove my underwear, so I remove my underwear and I'm standing there naked in front of him in this cell. And I said to him, "What do you want me to do? Bend over and cough?" He chuckled, he thought I was pretty funny. And he proceeded to look through all my clothing, leaving me standing naked in the cell and tells me I can get dressed and go sit down. He then proceeds to do the same thing to Ezra. And at this point, we knew that he wasn't going to actually probe us, but we felt so humiliated. And we're making some jokes as a resolve, which they were into. They were chuckling at what we had to say. It's worth noting that Ezra has got really really long red dreadlocks going down to his waist. And he's got white skin, and he's probably the biggest Bob Marley fanatic I've ever met in my life. And so near the end of the whole procedure, after we've been talking to the cops and they've been pretty light with us. One of the cops behind the desk says, "You guys all right. Most of the people we get arrested in here, they're telling us to fuck off, kicking at us, spitting at us, they're just being real dicks. And you guys are pretty good natured about this, I'm sure the judge will appreciate that." And Ezra, he does this look, he turns to me and kind of this quizzical look on his face. Then he turns to the officer and he says, "We're high." [light jazz music] - [Jared] Okay. There you go, you knew it was the last one. You wanted some, didn't you? You're spitting all over me. [knocking on door] - Hello? - [Voiceover] Hey. - Who is it? - [Voiceover] It's me. - It's you. - It's me. - It's you. - What's up? - How you doing? - I'm good, how are you? - I'm very good. - So he's here finally. - David. - That's the name, David? - Yeah, he arrived. - He cool? Have you talked to him? - I mean, I talked to him a little bit, but I... I didn't talk to him too much. I was just sunbathing up on the roof. - What was he doing on the roof? - Him? - Yeah. - He came up the fire escape. - He came up the fire escape? - Yeah, with all of his stuff. - Was the front door locked or something? - That's what he said. - [laughs] Really? - Yeah. - Wow, does he have a lot of stuff? How'd he get up the front? - He had a guitar, on his back. - Cool, a musician. - He had a backpack full of some shit, I don't know what. And a very large sign. Huge sign. Saying "David's Place." - I guess it is now. - Yeah, exactly, exactly. - Jesus. - He seems like a nice guy. But... - David's Place. - I don't know, you know. Coming up the fire escape with his sign. It's a little odd, but he seemed happy. - Were you sunbathing? - Yeah. - Geez. I hope he's cool. - He is. You should go talk to him. - Yeah, I'm sure. If he does some music, maybe I'll hook up with Chip or something. - Haven't heard a thing since I let him in. About a couple hours ago. - Like is there any furniture coming? - Nothing, nothing. Nothing. - Geez. - Not a thing. I just let him in, he seemed very grateful. Little, he seemed a little confused, which was funny. You know, he's kind of like "Oh, yeah. Oh, you have the key, oh yeah." You know, so... Then I let him and he was kind of... Didn't seem to, you know... I don't know, little off. But who am I to judge anyway? - Anything's better than that previous guy, too. - Oh, come on. - We don't wanna talk about that. - No. - So you doing all right? - Yeah, I was just taking a nap. - Well, I didn't mean to disturb. I just thought I'd come up and say hi. - Nice to see you. - Yeah, it's good to see you too. - You been hiding out in your apartment? - I've been working non stop. - Yeah, you're looking a little... - Morgan's got me running all over the place. - Does he? - But it's cool, I'm learning tons. - Good. - Get my foot in the door and everything. - It was nice to see you. - I'll see you soon. - Take care. - Bye. - Oh, hey, hey. - Hi. I'm getting all these visitors today. - Hey, yeah, well you know. I saw Jared, he was here. - Yeah. - I knew you were home. So I just thought... - Wanted to come say hi? - Yeah, hey. You know... Hey, you know, I'm sorry. That guy, that guy came in today? - Yeah, David. - Yeah, David came in today? - Yeah, Jared and I were just talking about that. - He didn't seem like a very cool guy. - When did you see him? - Oh, you know, on the roof. Just saw him on the roof. Like when he was climbing on roof. - Did you see me up there too? - No. No, no. - I was up there. I was sunbathing. - Oh, well. Hey. - Surprised you didn't see me there. - Yeah, well, me too. - Yeah. - I mean, I don't know, I wasn't up there. - So how you been? - You know, pretty... - Yeah? You're looking a little better. - Cool, yeah. Well, I'm sorry about that whole... - Yeah, don't, let's not talk... - That cafe thing, yeah. - That was little strange. Little strange. - Well, you know, it's just like a weird... Kind of like a... - Your time in your life... - You know the... - I know. - I was thinking maybe we could like go to a movie sometime or something like that? - That's an idea. - Yeah, you think so? - Who knows. - Yeah. - Maybe. - Yeah. You smell real nice today. - Thank you, you always say that. Is this for me? - That's yours, yeah. I gotta go. I gotta crap, sorry. - I was probably about 16 or 17. I had just gotten off of work, I was sitting at my house and there was a knock on the door. And I went to the door and it was my friend. Call him Jake. An his motorcycle had broken down on the freeway which was about four blocks from my house at the time. And he came in and we were talking and I just said, "I'll just give you a ride home." So as we were driving to his house, he said, "You wanna come in and have a beer?" I said sure, why not. So we stopped at the store and he went in. He came out, two 40 ounces of Rainier ale. And we proceeded to go to his house and we're drinking and talking. And he starts to get a little too deep on me. Reading me his poetry. About drinking red wine and swimming women. Next thing you know, I get up, I'm totally drunk. I sit back down on his bed and I'm passed out. I'm out. And next thing I know, I wake up and he's fucking me. And all I can think of and see when I close my eyes is demons and devils and scary shit and I felt like a little bug that had curled up into a ball. And I must've passed out again because I woke up, got out of bed and looked down at him and he was passed out on the bed. Condom still on. And I walked into the bathroom and I puked. And I puked for about three days straight. [guitar playing and singing] [door knocking] - Hey, welcome to David's place. I'm David. - Yeah, hi, you see the ceilings? - Yeah. - Those are real thin in this building, okay? I'm right above you. - Okay. - Could you keep it calmed down a little bit? - Yes. - I appreciate it. I sleep during the day, I work at night. That's really thin, okay? - Okay. - You got it? - Yeah. - Okay, thanks. - Okay. Bye. [playing guitar softly] Hey, Shannon. - [Voiceover] Hi. - Hey, what's up? - [Voiceover] Nothing, how you doing? - Good, how are you? - [Voiceover] Good. - I'm bored. Entertain me. - [Voiceover] Why don't you come over, we'll all go upstairs. - Okay. - [Voiceover] Bring your guitar. - Okay, sure. - Me and one of my best friends got this one together. It's a Celtic knot. And then I have this one up here that I got when I was 14. This one I got done over a long period of time. An ex-boyfriend of mine drew the picture. And I liked the idea of the sun, but the almost has, if you look up close, it almost has the face of a, it's like a Buddha face. He has a third eye. I don't know if it necessarily has all that much meaning to me. At that time I don't know, you know... If anything had that much meaning to me. But now it does. It has quite a bit of meaning to me. I feel very close to the sun, more so than to the moon. But this is definitely my favorite tattoo, and the one I feel closest to. [guitar playing] - What the hell is this anyway? - Don't you have the problem where you got your toast in the toaster and you don't wanna stick a knife in it to get the toast out, but it's too hot to grab with your hands? - I don't have a toaster. - Well, if you did. You put this in, you grab the toast. You pull it out. - I like that. - Yeah. That way you don't get electrocuted, and you don't get burned. - Oh. Maybe you should put thinner toast in there. - There you go. - All right. I got another one. Here you go, I think you'll like this one. - Sing away. - Okay. - Okay.

Like that? - [Shannon] Careful, careful. This stick, don't. The stick. The stick has tons of power in it. Okay? Now just drop it. Bring it forward, you feel it? Do you feel it? - Well, I feel from your fingers. - It goes... I study acupressure. - [David] With the stick? - With the stick. - Like, you do acupressure with the stick. - Yeah. That's what I do. Tons of clients. - [David] You wanna... I wanna sample. - Okay. Lay down. - [David] Let me take my shirt off. - [Shannon] So where are you from? - Where am I from? I'm from... I'm from... I don't know where I'm from. Does it matter? - [Shannon] Of course it matters. - Why does it matter? - Where somebody's from tells a lot about them. - [David] You don't need to know where I'm from. Oh wow. I feel the energy now. Are you seeing anybody? - Yeah, I do. I have a... I have a lover, you could say. - [David] A lover? - Yeah. - [David] Yeah? - Yeah. - [David] What's his name? - Michael. - [David] Michael. - Yeah. - [David] So Michael mind when you give massages to other guys in your bed? - No. - He must be great. - [Shannon] He is. - He have great hands? - [Shannon] Does he? - Yeah. - [Shannon] Oh yeah. Wonderful ones. You think I have energy in mine. - Yeah, he's got really good energy? - [Shannon] Oh my god. His energy is incredible. - Okay, how about mine? - [Shannon] No. - No? - [Shannon] I'd have to tell you when you're sober, though. Because intoxicated people, their energy tends to... - Go fucked up. - [Shannon] Yeah, it doesn't, moves to other places. - It's fucked up, it's fucked up. - [Shannon] Yeah. How long you here for? For good? - Will you cuddle with me? I don't know. - You're a lonely person, aren't you? - Sometimes. - You're reclusive. You like to stay to yourself? - I like people. I like you, you're pretty cool. - Hey. Wait til you meet the other people in this apartment. - Have met a few. - Have you? - I met the brothers. - They're quite a bunch. - Yeah [laughs], they're fun. - They ask you into their apartment? - How green are your eyes? - I don't know, tell me. - They're pretty green. - They're pretty green. - Yeah. - [Shannon] Yeah. - You have nice, I love long hair, it's really nice. - I used to have it short. But then I decided to grow it, Michael loves my long hair. - I bet he does. - Yeah. - How long have you been seeing Michael? - Oh, Michael... For, god now it's been about, 7 or 8 months? Because I met him right after I moved. - Is it love? - He's a very powerful man. - Big hands? - Just hands filled with energy. Lots and lots of energy. I like that in a man. Energy. - Yeah? - You have it. You have that energy. - Do I? - You do. But you're suppressing it. - In what way? - In a... Just like you said, you hate yourself. You know? As long as you hate yourself. - Well, I think you can know that you're kind of at the lowest of the low, but you can still feel powerful about it. - True. But as long as you hate yourself, the energy's not gonna have access to get out. Because you're filled with so much other crap. - I don't really wanna talk about that. - Okay. - What? What the fuck? - We could at least be on the bed. - All right, then. Let's move. Do you need the stick in the middle? - Stick is my protection. - [laughs] Well, let's put it right here on this side. - Okay. - I got it. - Okay, I got it. Just put it right there. Okay? - Do you want this or not? Because you're acting like you want it, and then you're acting like you don't want it. And I don't know which one. I mean I'm just... - I'm fickle. - You're fickle. Either you want it or you don't, I don't understand what... You don't like go half way. - How do you feel our energy is? - I think it's... Well, I don't know. - You don't know? - Because you're kissing me and then you're stopping kissing me. - But that's what it's all about. You give a little, you take a little, you feel it out. - Do I kiss you and then I'll go home, and then maybe tomorrow we'll kiss a little more. And then goes a little further and then tomorrow... Or you wanna just cut through the bullshit and just do it now? - You're a very angry person, aren't you? - I just don't think there's any reason to fuck around. If there's an attraction, you just... - This shows where your energy is. You felt my energy. - Look, I don't know anything about these energies. I just know what I know and that's when two people are looking at each other and they start kissing. It's like there's a reason and they want to go where they need to go. - Right. - Their lips are leading them where they wanna go. - Right. I like that. Their lips are leading them where they wanna go. - Exactly. So there's no reason to stop and think about it. - But what if their lips don't wanna lead them that way anymore? - Well then you... - Just for that split second. - And then two seconds later they wanna go? - Yeah. - Then I think you're a tease. - You think I'm a tease? - I think you are. - No one's ever called me a tease before. - Because they haven't had the balls to say it to you. - Is that it? - Yeah. No one likes a tease. - No one likes a tease. - No. - That's funny, a lot of people like me. - Hmm. They like... I have enough problems with myself to get sucked into somebody else's drama. - Are you insulting me? - I'm just telling it like I see it, that's all. Maybe other people like to get sucked into your drama, but I don't know if I do. - I don't feel like it's drama, really. - What do you want? - I know I don't want you holding me down, not letting me have my stick. So much for neighborly love. - [David] Yeah. - Okay. Oral sex. I remember when I was about 14. I started asking my mom questions. We had a pretty open relationship. About talking sexually about things. I asked my mom what was oral sex. And she of course explained it to me in detail. And I asked her if she liked it. And she said no. And she proceeded to tell me why. And she told me that her and my dad, it wasn't something that she liked to do. And she always felt cheated in the marriage. Because it was something that he really likes and there was this huge power struggle over it. And her reasons for that were that were when they first started going out together, apparently, he had had this girl in high school, his sweet heart. And because they decided they weren't gonna make love, they had this huge oral sex thing going on. And ever since he told her that, my mom felt like it was their thing and it turned her off. I guess she felt that when they were having oral sex, that he was thinking about her, not my mom, but the girlfriend. And first of all, I probably had no business hearing that story. But something that's interesting was that, I realized it affected me in my relationships. One, that I never really trusted a guy. When he was going down on me, I never trusted him. Because I had all these stories about my mom and how it didn't feel good. And how it's something that men do a lot with their girlfriends that they're not gonna marry. And it's just amazing looking back. How inhibited I was from receiving something and allowing myself a sexual pleasure because of conditioning. That my mom didn't even know she was giving me. But however, I said to myself that oral sex is one thing, but I will not cum on a guy's face until he's married to me. I hope it's soon. [laughs] - Hello? Hello? Mika. - David. How's it going? - Good, how are you? Come here. You look great. Oh my god, I have no friends out. When did you come out here? - I left. - It took me a while to get out here too. What are you doing here? - I have a friend named Shannon. - Yeah. Right next door? - Yeah. - Yeah, I met Shannon. She let me in, she let me in. - Something went down... - What did she say? What the fuck... What the fuck did she say? - She just... I don't know. - She say I raped her or something? - Well, did you? - No. Hell no, you know me. - Well, what the fuck, what's going on? - I mean, she invites me over for beer right? I bring my, she says bring your guitar. And then like she's moving over me as I'm playing all my songs. Totally into me. And then I go to the bathroom. - I need you to be really straight with me about this. - She's in a room. And she's like massaging me. - And then what? - I kissed her. I kissed her to see what was gonna happen. - And she told you no. - She told me no. And then I say what do you want? And then she kisses me again, she kissed me. - Yeah, well, that's not how I heard it. - Well, then you heard it wrong. Do you want... Do you wanna talk in my room or somewhere about this? - Can we just go for a walk or something? - Sure, sure. I mean... - It's really nice to see you though. - Yeah. - Surprised. - Yeah, it's weird. You look great. - Thanks. - Yeah, let's go. - I need to know what happened. I mean, I don't need to know, but... I'm involved. I don't wanna be involved at this point. Because I feel torn. But I need to know what happened. - We were hanging out and he... Yeah, I invited him over, yeah, we had a couple beers. Yeah, he was playing his guitar, we were having a great time. It was totally, just mellow, you know? Really really mellow. And it was fine until the point where he was holding me down. You know, forcing me to make some decision. After knowing this guy for maybe 4 hours. And you know what? I'm not even asking for your support anymore. - Hold on a fucking minute, all right? Just hold on. If this is about our friendship. Then you need to show that you trust me. Because maybe there's some things that I see about you. That you can't see about yourself. Maybe I know where you make yourself vulnerable. Maybe I know that you have issues. And don't for a second think that I haven't been in similar situations where I've had to make decisions, all right? It's not about... It's not about me and you here. It's about you. And it's about what you've created in your life. It's about you pawning shit off on other people. [rhythmic music] - Hey. - [Shannon] Hi. - I got it for you. - [Shannon] Thank you. - How are you? - [Shannon] Okay. You? - I'm doing all right. Listen, I wanted to talk to you about... [rhythmic music] - He's got my hat. You got my hat, dude. - Yeah. - I don't think... I think there's not much to talk about. I think what happened happened and right now I'm just... I don't feel right talking to you, okay? - Okay. I was 19. And I was visiting the west coast with my family. We have cousins out here. We'd come out every couple years and hang out for a few weeks and stuff. And it's cool because one of my cousins is my age. And we get along pretty well. We're kind of opposites but we get along pretty well. At the time, I was 19 and he was really into raves. And so we, one Saturday night, we went out to Santa Cruz. And a lot of times during the summer, they have raves out on the beach. Actually, this one was on top of a cliff overlooking the ocean. It was crazy. I'm not even really into techno and that stuff. But it was kind of fun to take a lot of drugs and dance. And there was a lot of beautiful people there. So I just had beer in one had and a nitrous blue in the other. Joint sticking out of my mouth and high on ecstacy and acid. I was out of it. Just dancing. At some point, there's like these red lights going off, and we all looked up to the highway, there's cops, there's like four or five cop cars there. It's kind like a raid, but not really. Everybody's just kind of has to disperse and take off. So we all start trudging across this meadow, kind of a back way to our car. Trudging through these weeds, and at some point I smile, I stumble or something. And there's this girl sitting there. She grabs me and she starts kissing me. Furiously kissing me. And I'm just going with it, because I don't know where I am at this point anyways. And next thing I know, she's undoing my pants. And I'm undoing her pants. And we just start fucking right there. I remember it vividly because the grass was kind of wet. And right off to the side, just like two feet away, was I think a purse, this silver glittery, little tiny purse. I don't know how long this thing lasted, whatever it was. But we finished, I finished, and I got up and I think I even said thank you. And I remember, as I was about to walk away, I look, and I don't see the purse. But whatever. It wasn't like... I just remember not seeing the purse. I remember seeing it, not seeing it. Big deal, whatever, her loss. So I'm walking back. I end up finding my friends and we all start making our way towards our car. And we're all like parked on the highway like cars on one side, cars on the other. They're kind of helping me to the car. And I remember I turned to my left, and across the street, I see the girl. And next to her is this guy. And he's kind of like, his body's kind of shaking like he's about to puke. But I kind of focus, and this guy actually has the purse. The silver glittery purse in his hand. And he's sobbing uncontrollably. Just sobbing. And I'm just like whoa. I just remember kind of falling into the car and passing out. - [Voiceover] Is this like musical chairs? - [Voiceover] I'll tell you what to do. Just keep going in circle. I gotta go three times. - [Voiceover] I'm getting dizzy. - [Voiceover] No, you have to be turned, to be perfect. On a side, you have to choose a side. - Some directionals. - [Voiceover] Right. - You are south. I am north. You are west. And you are east. [humming] - From the east, the sun rises, the source of light. Travels to the west, where the ocean is where which we are all born. - From the north comes the cold wind of winter, clarity and inspiration. To the south where the sun lies and lives and breeds. The he-hash-iza. - From the west the sun sets. - [Voiceover] Dude, the sun doesn't set from the west. - Sorry. In the west, the sun sets. And ending the day to start the cycle all over again. - [Voiceover] Life and the death. All right, next. - From the south, we get the deserts and... - [Voiceover] The dry heat. - The penguins and the dry... - [Voiceover] Penguins in the desert? - I mean they're far. They're not in the desert, but they're... - [Jared] Sounds good to me. - [Voiceover] It's fine. - [Voiceover] Everyone's brought desert [mumbles]. - [Voiceover] To the center of the circle. Which is the focus of our existence. - [Voiceover] Which is the point which brings us all together. - [Voiceover] The basis of reality. - [Voiceover] The earth beneath us and father sky above. - [Voiceover] From beyond which the moon travels. - [Jared] This isn't freaking you out, is it? - No, it's just different. - [Voiceover] Wait. It is 5:42 and 35 seconds. How long is it gonna take? Dude, you should've let the guest go first. - [Voiceover] Welcome, welcome to the neighborhood. - [Voiceover] We are at Dave's place. - [Voiceover] That's what the sign says. - That's pretty cool. - [Voiceover] So you guys know this thing is... - [Voiceover] Manic, as you were. - [Jared] Oh, I'm just getting started. - [Voiceover] I'm so stoned. - [Voiceover] How long have you guys lived down here? - Wait, when? When did it happen? - [Jared] I've only be here 6 months now? - [Voiceover] I have no idea. - [Voiceover] Six months, yeah? - Yeah, I moved from the east coast. - [David] Right, we were talking about it. I'm from the east coast too. - But you didn't know anybody in common right? It's funny though, I met a lot of people out here who know people in common or friend of friends. - [David] Yeah. Are you okay there? You want some water dude? - I'm cool, I'm cool. - [David] Hey, you guys know Shannon next door? - [Jared] Oh, yeah, she and I are good friends. - [David] What's she like? - She's hella fine, dude. Sometimes I spy on her. - Yeah [laughs] Spy on her? What? - I can't help it, dude. - [David] What do you... You're spying on her? - [Voiceover] Well, not always. Just once or twice. - [Voiceover] Does she have a boyfriend? - [Voiceover] Sometimes, I mean... I don't know. - What? - [Voiceover] You smell so good. - [Voiceover] You smell so good. - [Voiceover] I love the way you smell. She told me that every time she's here, it's how she smells. - [Voiceover] She smells good. - [David] Is this the kind of place... Is this like Melrose Place? Is this like where everybody sleeps with everybody in this building? You guys know, right? - [Voiceover] I don't sleep with him. - [Voiceover] Actually, yeah we don't sleep together, we're brothers, of course. - [Voiceover] I don't even... What are you talking about, dude? - But lots of people sleep with each other. The mailman is having an affair with [mumbles] - [Voiceover] The mailman? How do you know this? How do you know this? - She lives on the bottom floor, I just fucking go up peek through her window. [laughs] - Not the female man, mind you. Or the boy man. - [David] What are you talking about? - [Voiceover] It's the mail man. - Has he ever been caught? - No. - You guys see everything, don't you? - [Jared] Have you ever looked in my window? - [Voiceover] What? - Ever spy on my apartment? - Do we? - Do you? - We won't tell anyone. Your secret's my secret. - [Jared] What have you seen? - You don't know our secrets. - That's true, you don't know. - [Voiceover] We know you're burning in love with what's her face. - [Voiceover] That's not a secret. What about you? You dating somebody? - [Voiceover] When was the last time you had sex? - Dude, don't even go there, dude. - [Voiceover] [laughs] Why not? - I don't feel comfortable talking about it, I'm sorry. - He's very uncomfortable with his sexuality. - [Voiceover] I still wanna know what you guys have seen me do. - [Voiceover] Don't even talk about that. - [Voiceover] About what? - Relationships. People just always hurt each other's feelings. It seems like no one's ever making up their minds. And they tend to fuck each other over pretty hard. At least that's what I've experienced. I've done the same to other people. - [David] I just think it's... I think it's part of just, it's not like that's new. I think that's par for the course. Anything that makes it better than that is like exceptional. - [Voiceover] Yeah, I think that she shouldn't use the stick so much. The other day, on the bed in there... I'm losing the way. - You're making me sick, dude. - What? - [Voiceover] What are you fucking talking about? - Were you fucking looking? - Looking at what? - I don't know. - Were you fucking looking? - Looking at what? - Look at me, were you fucking watching in her room yesterday? You fucking snoop. - What's he talking, what are you talking about? What are you guys talking about? - You might wanna get the fuck out of here right now. - I don't know what we're talking about. - Dude, be cool, man. - You might wanna get... Were you looking? - What are you talking about? - You don't know me. - I don't, but it sounds like you guys know me very well all of a sudden. - We just know you're Dave and you just moved in here. It's cool. You don't want funk. You don't want funk with some fools from this building. - What are you guys talking about? - Where are you from? Where are you from, man? Where are you from? - I want you guys out of here right now. - What are you talking about? - You know, it's kind of... It's a good thing. - I want you guys out of my place right now. - This is getting heavy. - Take your shit. - This is getting heavy, hey. - Get your hands off me and get the fuck out of my house, you too, Jared. - What are you talking about? What did you see doing? - [Jared] You need to relax, brother. You need to explain what's been going on. You guys, you should probably... What are you talking about? - Get out of here, dude. - What are you talking about? - Get out of here. - No, I'm not gonna leave. What the fuck you talking about? - Get out of here. - We're all sitting here, we're mellowing out. - Get out of here! - Don't you fucking yell at me. Why you fucking yelling at me? - Get out of here. - You gotta chill the fuck out, man. This is not how you deal with people. - Look, you don't know me, we just met. Please, give me some space. All right? - [Jared] Fuck you, too, man. You're spying in my window, I don't trust you. I don't trust you. - Get outta here. Let's go. - Don't fucking touch me. Don't fucking touch me. This is not even to do with you. - [David] This is not... I have nothing, I have no problems with you, okay? I have no problems with you. - [Jared] Then why you kicking me out of the apartment? - [David] Because I want this space by myself right now. - [Jared] And it's the way you look at yourself. It's how you look at yourself. - [David] Whoa. You don't even know what's going on. You wanna know what's going on, you talk to them. - [Jared] That's fine with me. - [David] You talk to them. I don't care about you. [melancholy rhythmic music] - [David] You know any jokes? - No. - You always had a joke for me. It's not my apartment. Someone named David is supposed to be here but I guess he's not here yet. When I showed up they thought I was him. [laughs] So I'm just, I got this pretty place for a while. I don't know how long. That's the thing, I don't know how long. - David. Your dad's dead. You're never gonna be able to bring him back. You need to let go of him. You're dragging that sign all the way across country. David, you need to just let it go. - You know, I came out here. I came out here for you. - [Voiceover] I'm leaving in a week. If you wanna come with me, you know where I live. You have a week to figure it out. - Hey - [David] Hey. - This is 15, right? - Yeah, 15. Who are you? - I'm Dave. - [David] Dave. - Yeah. I'm moving in. You Rick? I think I talked to you on the phone about renting the place. - Yeah. Yeah, I'm Rick. - Cool. - Yeah, go out, your key's coming, you're sweating. - Yeah, I got a bunch of crap down in the truck waiting to come in. - Okay, well then... - Sorry I'm a little late. - Yeah, let me get your key. - Thanks. - Yeah, here you go. - Oh, cool, thanks. - Number 15, there you go. - Thanks a lot. You're a musician huh? - Oh, yeah. Adios. - Cool. - Have fun. - Thanks a lot, man.
