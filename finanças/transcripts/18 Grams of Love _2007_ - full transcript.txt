I suspect... my wife is having an affair. I also suspect my wife of adultery. You want to investigate? You investigate my wife, I'll investigate yours. How? With love letters. 18 GRAMS OF LOVE MY DEAREST, I LOVE YOU. BEST REGARDS, ME EIGHT GRAMS ADDRESS YOUR ADDRESS TEN GRAMS 18 GRAMS OF LOVE Write love letters to them? If they reply, they're thinking of cheating. Why do you suspect your wife? ONE MONTH AGO Your muscles are too hard. When she said my muscles were too hard, with that tone, that... And that feeling... that... It's very difficult to explain. Based on my male instincts, I know she's attracted to another man. Do you know what I'm saying? Your rationale is very abstract. But... I believe you. What about you? Why do you suspect your wife? ONE MONTH AGO Hey, where did you go? Mahjong. - Why are you dressed like that? - It was very hot. I played the whole night and sweat a lot, so I slipped into something more comfy. Where did you play mahjong? My friend's house. It's a man's shirt. My friend is a man. She used to play with girlfriends only, but lately, she comes back in men's shirts. Obviously something is wrong. Your suspicions are well-founded. I believe you. My wife is surrounded by models. Sooner or later, she'll fall in love with someone else. Your wife manages those models. It's likely she'll have affairs. But my wife? All her customers are... The type, their faces... are the kind that... she could still have affairs with. What a pity. Remember the days all the girls would flock to us? Remember the days we were princes of love? What girl didn't want to meet us? Remember the days when we captured so many hearts? When I liked a girl, one letter would win me her heart. When I stopped liking a girl, one letter would break her heart. - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember the days... - Remember... - Remember... - Remember the days... My wife is a university graduate. My wife quit school after Sec Two. My wife is a Scorpio, emotional. My wife is a Sagittarius, gossipy. My wife loves reading prose. My wife likes watching porn. I know what to do. I also know what to do. I'll write prose to your wife. SENSUAL I'll write something sexy to your wife. SEXY These are the most famous quotes about love. Napoleon said to Jos√©phine... "I will hold you tight and cover you with a million kisses." Hemingway wrote, "When I love you, I feel the earth move." Goethe said to Vulpius... "Nourish my body and soul with love." "My thoughts..." I'm done. "Don't ask who I am. I'm a man with dreams. My dream is to become your lover. I know you're married, but the person in your bed doesn't know you like I do. I want to share... a blink of your love. The wonders of love lie clearly in knowing the love that's hard to ignore. It is a burden willingly borne. As Wang Xiaobo said, 'The sweetness of love... FORBIDDEN FRUIT ...is like two children eyeing a jar of preserves, tasting it bit by bit, enjoying every moment of sweetness.' Yours sincerely, wishing you health and love, Naughty Boy." Sexy? Sexy. I don't feel inspired at all. You're not in the right mood. How can you feel inspired? Take it off. Hey. Just relax... Relax... Now write. I'm feeling it. What are you doing? "I've known you for a long time. I've loved you for a long time. I adore your face... I worship your hair... Your shoulders... Your back... Your slender waist... Your thighs... I love your body. You may already know me. You may have already fallen for me. Please let me continue to love you, Your Young Admirer." Why are you wearing a man's shirt again? We were playing mahjong and it was hot. - We played overnight... - And sweat a lot, so you changed into more comfy clothes? Exactly. Do you expect me to believe that? I'm telling the truth. It's your problem if you don't believe it. Hey. Are you crazy? If I came home dressed like this and said I went to play mahjong at my friend's house for the whole night and sweat too much, so I changed into this blouse, would you believe me? Go away. Don't spoil my blouse. Take it off. - I won't. - Take it off. - No. - Off. Take it off now. No. Unless you take off yours first. - Take it off now. - Don't be rash. Take it off right now. Wait. No touching! My dream is to become a writer, but I'm only writing love letters. Hey, sexy writer, running out of ideas? Take off your clothes. Have you found a return address? What if my wife replies? Are you hoping your wife replies? Maybe your wife wants to reply, too. We really need a return address. Don't worry. I've already found one. Our wives will not suspect it. - Really? - Really. My ex-girlfriend's boyfriend's cousin's aunt's daughter's husband's neighbor is overseas, and he barely ever returns home. He's got an empty mailbox. He'll let me use it. So you can write in peace. Thanks for arranging that. Don't mention it, we're buddies after all. Listen to what I wrote. "I'm alone in this vacant room and feeling a rare sentiment. I'm not imagining us being intimate... but imagining your lovely expression as you wonder about our intimacy... Love fills us with inspiration. I crave such inspiration. It fills me with passion. As I write this letter, I feel your presence on the page. As Marx said... 'I cannot kiss you. I can only use words to bring my lips to yours.' Yours sincerely, with satisfaction, Naughty Boy." The following contents may induce fainting, stomachache, vomiting, even loss of consciousness. Are you ready? Yes. Can you help me with directions? Where do you want to go? To your heart. Something's wrong with my eyes! What's wrong? My eyes... can't turn away from you. I hope you know CPR. Why? Because your beauty has taken my breath away. - There's more. - More? - Please return it to me. - What? My heart, because you've stolen it. - How do you find it? - Very trashy. But... my wife will love it. No reply? No reply. This proves our wives aren't promiscuous. This proves we've lost our touch. Let's go. We'll have to work harder. Hello. Is anyone home? Excuse me. Who wrote to me? Hey. It took me a long time to get here. Open up. "Infatuated Youth," come out now. Can't I even hug you for a while? - Your muscles are too hard. - Is that a problem? I don't like it. Why are you acting so weird lately? I don't want to fight... It's school vacation now. Why do you have to go back? I'm going to Zi Hua's bookstore. Why? He wants to show me his new book. I took the day off today. Then I'll stay home. I'll keep you company. No need. I'll go back to the office later. Hello? I can't stand them anymore, calling me so early with their problems. So infuriating. I've asked them to call you. Sort this out for me, okay? Bye. But I took the day off today... Hello? Michelle, I've decided I want to learn Japanese, not French. I'll call you back. - Hello? - Michelle... What should I do? My girlfriend is pregnant. I'll call you back. Hello? Michelle... I've thought about it all night. I don't think being a model suits me. I'll call you back. Hello? Hello? Michelle... For the boss' birthday party tomorrow, I'd like to sing him a song. What song should I sing? I'll call you back. Hello? Ryan. - You have to learn French. - Why? Because we're sending you to France. You'll be acting in French films. In Japan, you'll only be in adult films. That's all, bye. Hello. - Roy? - What should I do? You're in your thirties. If you got your girlfriend pregnant, then marry her. It's that simple. Bye. Hello. Ray... Listen to me. If you're not talented, we won't sign a contract with you, and I won't waste my time persuading you now. - Really? - Yes... I'm sorry. Modelling is what you're good at. You can't run away from it. - Really? - Yes. It's that simple. Bye. Hello! Rick. Sing "Forget Me Not" tomorrow. I don't know it. If you don't know it, go and learn it. If you don't like it, accept it. Sing it for me tomorrow. That's all, bye. Hello, boss. I've settled all your problems. You can go to work now. You're amazing! Mr. Wong, look at these. Someone wrote me love letters. Who writes love letters these days? Well, this person who likes me does. "Infatuated Youth"? - Don't read too much into it. - What do you mean? Based on my experience with letters and my instincts, this letter must be fake. Really? A fake? Yes. It's a malicious prank. Prank. And I thought someone liked me. Let me ask you. If someone sent you a love letter, what would you do? It's just a prank, what could I do? Let me ask you. How heavy is a piece of paper? - How would I know? - Eight grams. How heavy is an envelope? Ten grams. Together, they weigh 18 grams. This person picked up a pen and paper, bought a stamp and an envelope, and carried a letter weighing 18 grams to a post office to mail it to you. With today's modern technologies, why didn't he just press a button? Call, email or text you? But this person took the time to write it out. Maybe he's really interested in you. Then why did you say it was a prank? Based on my experience with letters, I might be wrong sometimes. And men's instincts are usually not accurate. That means... these are real! If these are real, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna be very happy. This proves I'm still desirable. He says he adores my hair, my shoulders, my back, everything about me. All right. Don't get so worked up. So if this person wants to date you, will you accept? Of course. Being desired is wonderful. Just so you know, anyone can snatch me away anytime. I can run away anytime. You'd better be nice to me. Hey. If I was younger, I'd slap you twice. Break your nose, push you against a wall and shove your head down the toilet. All right. - I'll go and wash your bra... - And underwear, too. I'm sorry, but I can't wait. I think my wife may have replied to you. I know I'm usually wrong, but I'm sure I'm right this time. Hang on... Hey... There's a letter. But it's from your wife to me. "Dear Naughty Boy... I thought you were a nuisance and I wanted you to stop writing. However, I admire your prose. And I have one request. Please be more direct. Yours sincerely, Great Mother." She replied to a stranger. She replied to someone she wants to know. All right. Let's be more direct. I'll ask her out. Dear Michelle, I'd like to meet you tomorrow at 8:00 a.m. Love, Naughty Boy Hey... Do you think she'll turn up? That's not important. The question is, why will she turn up? And if she doesn't turn up? That's not important either. The question is, why won't she turn up? So will she turn up? If she's meant to turn up, she will. If not... She's here. Although she's here, what matters is... Nothing matters now. Except for one thing... Have a drink with me. What's your problem? What's my problem? Don't come home if you're in a bad mood. Don't come home if I'm in a bad mood? You always come home in a bad mood. I'm under a lot of stress at work. And I'm not under any stress? If you're stressed, go to the gym. You think I like going to the gym? I go to the gym for you. Don't you blame me. You go because you feel inferior. Yes. I feel inferior, compared to the models in your office. Is that wrong? Are my models that intimidating? - Will you stop being ridiculous? - I'm being ridiculous? I want to be the best for you. Do you know I did it all for you? I stopped teaching math. I went to teach sports. I try to be more outgoing. When I'm with your friends, I try to participate. Am I wrong? Have I not done enough? I've already tried my best. What else do you want me to do? I'm also very stressed. I'm very tired. You love reading these, don't you? Of course, he writes better than you. Let me ask you. If he wants to meet you, would you go? Of course. I want to know what he looks like. If he's handsome, will you date him? Even if he isn't, I might still date him. I'm sorry, but I can't wait. I have a feeling she'll write back to ask why you didn't turn up. I seldom have these feelings. I must be right this time. Hang on... Hello, Zi Hua? There's no mail. Okay, bye-bye. "Dear Infatuated Youth... I'd like to meet you. Meet me on November 11th at 9:00 a.m. at the Aimei playground. My husband no longer yearns for me. I hope after we meet, we can fulfill each other's yearnings. Thanks. Yours sincerely, Infatuated Girl." Hi. Ah Hui? What a coincidence. Actually... not really. What are you doing here? Me? I... I... here... You're here... I... You were passing by? You weren't passing by? You're meeting someone here? Someone wrote to you to meet here? Infatuated Youth. So it's you. How silly of you. Wait. Let me explain. I was just joking with you. Joking with me? You wrote five letters to me as a joke? Don't joke. It's true. I haven't written these in a while. So I started writing them for fun. Then I thought of you. So I mailed them to you... just to see how you'd react. I was really joking with you. I wasn't serious. Do you know how much a piece of paper weighs? Eight grams. Do you know how much an envelope weighs? Ten grams. Together, they weigh 18 grams. You picked up a pen to write, stuck on a stamp and sealed the envelope, then walked to the post office to mail it. With today's modern technologies, if you want to joke, you could have called, emailed or texted. Why write a letter? Why the sincerity? I... Are you testing me to see if I have feelings for you? When Zi Hua first introduced you to me, I already felt that you were a good man and very handsome. I'm not good. I'm not handsome. Compared to Zi Hua, you are. Zi Hua is better. He's more handsome. Zi Hua's my best friend. I wouldn't do anything to hurt him. I'm not testing if you like me. I have no feelings for you. I will never yearn for you. Why are you so nervous? Hey. I have no idea why you wrote to me, but my gut tells me you're troubled. Do you and Michelle have problems? I don't believe you. We really don't. You weren't compatible from the start. Having problems is normal. Just look at me and Zi Hua. We used to get along so well, but now we have problems, too. What kind of problems? We're busy and don't see each other. But don't you see each other at home? He only wants to talk about his bookstore, and I only want to talk about my salon. He's not interested in my salon, and I'm not interested in his bookstore. Can't you try to be interested? That's the problem. The more he wants to talk, the less I want to listen. We feel more at ease apart. When we're not together, we don't miss each other either. I miss him less and less. It wasn't like this before. Isn't it sad? What about you? Do you miss Michelle? How often do you think of her? Honestly, I do miss her. It's just... I'm afraid of seeing her. Why? I'm afraid that when we meet, we'll have nothing to talk about. We actually have a lot to say. But there are things... we try to avoid talking about. We're not trying to avoid a fight. I'm just afraid of disagreements. I'm afraid we don't have chemistry anymore. Next time, you can confide in me. We can hang out and chat. No need to write letters. I think you've totally misunderstood. What? You think I like you? Look. You thought I liked you, and I thought you liked me. Aren't we alike? I... I have to go. I'm going back to school. Bye-bye. ZHANG TIANYI MASTERPIECES APPRECIATION Mr. Wong. I know who wrote those love letters. But I'm not telling you. Hello. You're working out, too? I just joined the gym. I'll be coming very often. Ah Hui... Do you know? I've been having financial difficulties. Financial difficulties? I've been very poor lately, but I'm really interested in fitness. I'd like to hire an instructor. But I have no money. Since you're a fitness expert, and we get along so well, could you... No problem. I can lend you the money. You can take your time to pay me back. No problem. Will you look at the time? I've been working out for six hours. A normal person... shouldn't train for more than six hours. How tiring. I'll leave first. Bye. Hello? Michelle, I have something to tell you. What is it? - I was at the gym... - Hang on. Hello? Michelle, I want to tell you something. What is it? I was at the gym... and I saw your husband. Hang on... Hello? Michelle, I have something to tell you. What is it now? I was at the gym and I saw your husband. But... he was with another woman. - They looked like... - Hang on. Speak. Michelle, I have something to tell you. You want to tell me you saw my husband with a woman at the gym? How did you know? They were very intimate. But don't worry, she's not as pretty. Okay. I got it. Bye-bye. A COLLECTION OF CONTEMPORARY WRITERS I'm furious. I can see that. Get out. Get out! Do you mean you or me? I'll go... I'll go... Are you asleep? Darling... It's been a while since you massaged me. Where were you today? I was at the gym. Alone? But my friends saw you with someone. Really? They said they saw you from afar. They think it's another man. I was with Zi Hua. Zi Hua goes to the gym? He... he's been acting strange lately. He got hooked on fitness. He even wanted me to be his instructor... Ouch! I'm stopping. I'm tired. Hello? Hi, Zi Hua, it's Michelle. Michelle? How are you? I'm good, thanks. What's up? Hello? This is Ah Hui. Now you're calling me? No letters? We need to talk. Why didn't you talk at the gym, then? I'm hoping that... you'll stop going to the gym. Are you afraid of seeing me? Nothing much. Hui said he was at your bookstore today. I wanted to know if it's true. Ah Hui... He was... Did he go to the gym first? He... was... Or did he go to the bookstore first? Why are you asking? No reason. I just want to know if he's lying to me. So... he really went to your bookstore? Yes! He wasn't lying. He was here. And... you weren't at the gym, correct? That's right. I wasn't at the gym. Okay. Thanks. Bye-bye. I think we shouldn't see each other. I see... Then I'll go to the gym every day. If you do... I'll tell Zi Hua tomorrow. I'll tell him... you're harassing me. I'll say you tried to seduce me. You heartless mongrel. Why do you play with my feelings? You used to say you liked my body... Why are you avoiding me now? You started this, and now you want to end it. Just what do you want? Please stop toying with me. I beg you, I beg you. Someone help me, please! Hello... Ah Hui? I was just about to call you. I have something important to tell you. Me, too. Wait. Is Michelle beside you? No, she's in the bedroom. I'm sleeping in the living room tonight. Me, too. What a coincidence. So... Your wife isn't beside you, either? No, she's not... How do you spell "mongrel"? M-O-N-G-R-E-L. Sorry... you can speak now. I... How about this, I'll look for you tomorrow. We'll talk then. All right. See you tomorrow. Bye. Who were you talking to? Was it Ah Hui? I heard you say his name. What does he want? Nothing... He wants to borrow a book. Zi Hua. Ah Hui? What did you want to talk about? It's like this... Hello! Ah Hui? It's been a while. What are you doing here? What are you doing here, too? Today's my day off, so I bought breakfast for my husband. Is this a private conversation? Am I interrupting? No, no, no... Oh, no! I only bought breakfast for two. Either I eat with my husband, or you eat with my husband... or you can eat with me! I've already eaten. I'll just borrow a book and leave. Come, come, come... What would you like to borrow? I'll take this. Love Letter of Mukoda Kuniko. Sure. Why lend it to him? You're a teacher. Your salary is very high. Can't you afford it? Why are you behaving like this? And you. Do you know how to earn money? How do you make money lending books? Is there a problem? He's my friend. This is a bookstore, not a library. That's the problem. Stop it. I'm not borrowing it. I'll buy it, okay? - How much? - How much? No need to pay. Fifteen dollars. Fifteen dollars. Thank you. Let me wrap this up. I'm sorry. She's... Mr. Ah Hui! Here's your... romance novel. Happy reading. Please come again. Bye-bye. Stop it. He really knows acupuncture? When I want him quiet, I do that. When he wants me quiet, he'll do that. This is our agreement. It's been 15 years. I don't think you understand. Go have breakfast... Breakfast. Where did you go so early? I went to Zi Hua's bookstore. Not to the gym? No. How's Zi Hua? I was looking for a book to read. Alone? Did your models see me again? I'm not trying to pick a fight. I just bought this book at Zi Hua's store. It's that simple. "You heartless mongrel. Why do you toy with my feelings? You used to like my hair, my shoulders..." Is something missing from this book? Yes, it is. What? It lacks passion. Kuniko's Love Letter lacks passion. Her style is implicit, but it is full of underlying emotions. What do you think about love letters? Why do you ask? There's a Love Letter fashion line. They approached our models. A Love Letter fashion line? Yuck. I just want to know what a man thinks. Love letters... Today... Not many people write them. - Is that so? - Think about it. A piece of paper weighs eight grams. An envelope weighs ten grams. Altogether, that's 18 grams. You still need to stamp and post it. Nowadays with texts, cell phones and email, why bother with a love letter? That's why writing shows sincerity. I used to write love letters in school, but now... I think it's pretty childish. No wonder you never sent me any. I'm going out. Michelle... Are you looking for Ah Hui? He left early. I'm not here to look for him. I'm here to look for trouble. Just kidding. My instincts tell me... you're afraid to see me. That's because my instinct tells me... you're not here to buy books. I came here for answers. For answers? Come, come. This way. Now this is the right way. Ask. Do you know how heavy a piece of paper is? - I have no idea. - Eight grams. Do you know how heavy an envelope is? - I have no idea. - Ten grams. Do you know who told me this? I have no idea. It was my husband. I don't know why he told me. Really? Did he mention love letters to you? No, he didn't. Who writes love letters these days? My husband said the same thing. Writing love letters is so boring and troublesome. Didn't you say they weigh 18 grams? Not every man can write them. Is Ah Hui having any problems? I don't think so. If he is, wouldn't you know first? Has he made any new friends? I think... No. If he had, you would know first. Michelle? Xiao Tong. Wow. It's been a long time. Yes, it's been a while. Why didn't you come to my salon? I've been very busy these past few months. - How are you? - Not well. Why? Love is not smooth... Marriage is not fulfilling. My husband has a problem. Hey... Let's not talk about unhappy things. I'll buy you some tea. Life is like that. You'll feel better after a cup of tea. Help me look after the store. You go ahead yourself. We women have things to discuss. Go, go, go. Don't come back till we close. Come... have a seat. Why don't I join you girls? I like to talk about women's issues. Just pretend I'm a woman. I'll chat with you both... Go. And don't come back. But I'm empathetic to women's problems. He drives me nuts. I found this in his book. It's written by a woman. Read it. This woman is so shameless. It's obvious Ah Hui doesn't like her. And she still writes to him? Do you know who sent this? So it's because of her... you're having marital problems? I'm not sure. My husband has been acting strange. He's always busy. Sometimes cold, sometimes affectionate. Say no more. This woman must be the cause. What should I do? What should you do? You have to confront him. I'm very good in these situations. Don't worry, I'll think of a solution. I've got it. What is it? We'll write as this woman and ask Ah Hui to meet her at a hotel. Then you hide and wait. If your husband appears, you'll catch him red-handed and force the truth out of him. Then... Then what? Then you have to decide whether to forgive him or leave him. Listen. You should write something like this. "If you don't want to have a fling with me, then we can stop, but I have one condition: one last fling. Friday morning, 9:00 a.m. Meet me at the Aimei Hotel. One last fling, and I'll never bother you again." If Ah Hui wants to break up with this woman, he'll show up. I... Well... Don't think too much. Come, write a letter. But we need this woman's handwriting to convince him. Let me help you. You're lucky. I'm an expert at imitating people's handwriting. And I'm super good. Okay, it's done. You heartless mongrel. Why are you toying with my feelings? It's too similar. I told you I'm an expert. You don't need to do anything. I'll write this letter and mail it. Go to bed early Thursday and go to the hotel on Friday to catch them. "One last fling, and I'll never bother you again." How many flings have they had? "One last fling and I'll never..." Stop playing with me! Why are you both so boorish? Yes, why try and test us? We weren't having any affairs. If we didn't try, how would we know? So what if you know? He's the one having an affair. I'm not. There's nothing between us. Nothing... She just likes you. Who says I like him? We were just playing. No, we weren't. Then why are you here to meet her? I wanted to explain that I'm not interested. What about you? You went to meet him. I only wanted to tell him to stop. You asked her out? You asked him out, too. I told you I wanted to know who he was. Then why arrange to meet him here? I didn't! Then why meet at a hotel? I didn't ask him out. I was helping her to test him. Stop pretending. You're the other woman. I was helping you to test him. I already suspected it was you. How else were you planning to fool me? I'm not playing with you. He's toying with me. I'm not toying with you. It's you who's toying with me. You're not toying with her? Then why not tell me she wrote to you? Because her letter was too scary. I didn't dare tell you. Then why meet her? I wanted to tell her to stop meeting me. If you'd have told me earlier, this wouldn't have happened. If you hadn't replied to him, things wouldn't be so complicated! Are you blaming me? No. I'm blaming her. This was both your idea. It's both of your faults. This was his idea. It's his fault. Fine. Blame it all on me. If it weren't for me... how would we know about our problems? He's right. We really have a problem. We already don't talk to each other. It's strange... Since we started suspecting each other, we've had so much to talk about. Isn't it funny? When you thought I was unfaithful... you finally started to care about what I do outside. When you thought I was unfaithful... you preferred to spend your time investigating instead of being with me. Before, when you cried... you would hug me. In the past... you wouldn't make me cry. I'm very disappointed in you. You're at fault... and you're blaming me? I was so oblivious to what you did. I'm very disappointed in myself, too. I've already told you about the letters. But you didn't seem to care. I'm disappointed in you, too. Stop defending yourself. You were interested in him. Yes! I was interested in him. You asked him to write to me. You gave me the chance to be close. You gave me the chance to like him. Enough! Stop making excuses. You're just a loose woman. Do you know how loose you are? A stranger writes to you... and you get close to him. Don't you think that's cheap? You're saying I'm cheap? You're married. Did you know... You were cheating on me! You wronged me. You are shameless. You're a slut! Do you always think of other men? Do you think of sleeping with them? Will you die without them? You're really loose. Really, really loose. You're cheap. You're a cheap person! This is not the first day you met me. I've always followed my heart. If anyone is nice to me, I'll be nice to them, too. But being nice is not the same as love. I can be nice to anyone. But the only one I love... is you. I'm sorry. I'm at your door. Will you let me in? I want to apologize. I'm sorry... I was looking for talent, for an ad. My client wanted a real teacher. During the audition... I saw him for the first time. He made me feel comfortable. I was very stressed. When I saw him... I couldn't help it. I cried. And I cried. And then, I don't know why... We were strangers, but I knew he would protect me. Although I was crying, I felt so relieved. Soon after, we dated. He'd hug me when I was stressed. When I'm with him, I don't need to be strong. I like that feeling. I liked how I felt with him back then. Things were simple... and comfortable. Then he changed. He became self-conscious. He became like the models I handled. He switched to teaching sports. He went to the gym. He trained until his muscles were hard and not nice to hug anymore. What about you? How did you fall for him? We were alike. He had ambition and talent. He set out to do what he wanted to do. He wanted to be a writer. When you see a man work hard to realize his dreams, that look in his eyes... his actions... his expressions... are so mesmerizing. Faced with harsh criticism, he continues to strive. Restarting from scratch... learning from his mistakes. He's really handsome. I know. If I should grow old, even if I die, I'll still remember the way he looks when he writes. He's so handsome. Back then, the girls I knew, they were smart... but fake. Except her. This is my latest work. Please let me know what you think. Forgive me for speaking frankly. I think the ideas you want to explore are old-fashioned. But the words fill me with numbness and comfort my soul. Your words fill my heart with warmth. It makes me realize that love without passion can still burn. In a life that's ordinary, it is no less stirring. This is crap. But... you will succeed. Why? Because you know me. I will encourage you... encourage you until you succeed. Which hand do you write with? This one, why? This is how she is. She always speaks her mind. I love her for her honesty. But now... why am I doubting her? What about you? Why do you love Michelle? Because... she makes me feel... that I'm a fantastic man. Back then, they were making a teaching ad. My school sent me. When I first saw her... she cried. She hugged me. I didn't know her, but I could feel that she needed my protection, she needed my love. I like this feeling. Then we fell in love with each other. She allows me to protect her, allows me to love her. She is tough in front of other people, but in front of me, she was... the person I loved. I like to hug her. I like to protect her. But lately... she's changed. She doesn't let me hug her. It's like... she prefers the old me. Why is it that when we have problems, we can't think back to the time when we first fell in love? Why doesn't he trust me? Why doesn't he believe me? My darling... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have doubted you. It was all my fault. It was the love letters' fault. From today onwards, I won't write love letters to others. I'll spend each day writing to you. I want to move you. I want you back beside me. My darling... I'm sorry. I shouldn't have scolded you. But I've already done that, and you've already cried. Now the only thing I can do is make you the second-happiest person. Why not the first? Because when I married you... I became... the happiest person in the world.
