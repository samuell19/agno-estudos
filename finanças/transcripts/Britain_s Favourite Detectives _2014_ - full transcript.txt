They're intelligent... They call me Fitz, what do they call you? ...but flawed. Determined... Only interested in one thing here, and that's bent coppers. ...and complex. What are we dealing with? Something new. Can be scruffy or stylish... ...but are always driven. You have no right to take the law into your own hands! And sometimes fierce. Drop the gun! From the mean streets of 1980s New York City... to the breath—taking scenery of modern day Northumberland. Well, you were right. Well, it's like I've done this before. From the peace and tranquility of Oxfordsmre... to the sprawling metropolis of 21st century London. Call him off. They've been gracing our TV screens for over 70 years... Are you up to something, Miss Marple? Am I? ...and have become some of the most beloved characters to appear on the box. My name is Columbo. Frost. Taggart. These are the top 25 crime—fighters the ITV audience voted for in their thousands as Britain's Favourite Detective. PHONE RINGS DCI Tennison. The fictional detective has been a feature in popular culture since Edgar Allen Poe's The Murders in the Rue Morgue was written in 1841. For nearly 200 years, writers have been creating these complex and fascinating characters. Firstly, on the page, before bringing them to screens, both big... You got a gun? No. What'd you do with it? I never had one. ...and eventually small. It wasn't long, though, before law enforcement officers became a regular fixture on TV screens. In the 1950s, shows like Dragnet became hugely popular in America, while in the UK, we had Dixon of Dock Green, followed a few years later by Z—Cars. It's these shows that paved the way for the many detectives that have graced our screens over the past 70 years, which is why we charged you, the ITV audience, with the task of uncovering the nation's favourite. Get on with it, then. So let's start the countdown by heading to Scandinavia for the detective duo that are first up at number 25. In 2005, Swedish novel The Girl With The Dragon Tattoo was published to huge international success. Two years later, a Danish TV series called The Killing was broadcast, and when it came to the UK in 2011, it became a break-out hit. Then the following year, BBC Four broadcast what it hoped would be the next great detective drama from Scandinavia. This one was set in both Sweden and Denmark, and the mystery starts when a body is found on the bridge. The bridge in question is the Oresund Bridge, which links Malmo, Sweden, with Copenhagen, Denmark. A body is found exactly in the centre of the bridge, so a joint investigation is required, with Saga Noren, played by Sofia Helin, leading the Swedish investigation, and Martin Rohde, played by Kim Bodnia, acting as her Danish counterpart. As well as being from different countries, the lead detectives had very different personalities. Saga was aloof, humourless, with no social skills. Whereas Martin was warm, friendly and likeable. Although very much a team, it was the brilliant and devoted police investigator Saga who emerged as an unlikely heroine with the audiences. As well as having a compelling lead character, the programme also had a labyrinth plot that twisted and turned throughout the first series, leaving viewers on the edge of their seats. Such was the success of The Bridge that it was remade in a number of territories, including America and the UK. Three more series followed the original, and its popularity saw it broadcast in over 100 countries. Our next detective had a rather unusual and fortuitous journey to the small screen. The setting for this particular police procedural was the north—east of England in the Swinging Sixties. And it was just as focused on offering viewers a gripping detective drama as it was a realistic snapshot of time and place. This is the world of Inspector George Gently. Screenwriter Peter Flannery discovered the George Gently stories in a dusty, old book shop and decided they were ripe for a television adaptation. The person chosen to play the leading man was Martin Shaw. I need all the facts, john, no more evasions. Like all good detectives, Gently needed a partner, and it was actor Lee lngleby who would take on the role of Detective Sergeant john Bacchus. You and Ronnie Chadwick went to Rakes and you picked a fight with Patrick Donovan. Why? Gently was a bit of a father figure to Bacchus, and they both had different approaches to the job. The old school inspector versus the modern man. You're just a kid, aren't you? You've got no self-discipline, you want sweeties all the time. I want a full account. Come and find me tomorrow. But... Sir... Look, I didn't bring my car. Well, walk! The show embraced its '60s setting and reflected real social issues of the time. There is a house in this city where abortion is performed on a weekly basis, and a blind eye is turned towards it. In England, in the 20th century. Why aren't you investigating those murders? More of a whydunnit than a whodunnit, the show proved to be more about the relationship between Gently and Bacchus that builds over 25 episodes and ten years. And the combination of detective drama, nostalgic history lesson, and character study is the reason why George Gently counts himself firmly amongst your favourites. In the past, female detective duos have been a bit thin on the ground. So actresses and friends Suranne jones and Sally Lindsay decided to do something about it. They came up with the idea of a Mancunian Cagney 81 Lacey, and with the help of writer Sally Wainwright, created a brand-new pair of police officers. Working in the Major Incident team, they went by the names of Scott 81 Bailey. You ready, mate? The show was first broadcast in May 2011... Yeah. ...and was an instant hit for ITV with over nine million viewers tuning in. Turkish girl, 18 years old, the husband found her at half six last night when he got in from work, rang for an ambulance at 6:37 saying his wife's killed herself. Writer Sally Wainwright was keen that the show move away from the idea of the woman against the boys club narrative that had been used in the past. She wanted to show that it was perfectly acceptable to be a woman in a high-powered job. I'm Detective Constable Janet Scott and this is Detective Constable Rachel Bailey. The cases they were working was only half the story, though, and the real appeal of the show came from the relationship between the two lead characters. He's finished with me. What? Nick dumped me. When? Day before yesterday. Why? I'm boring. They were friends as well as colleagues, and found time to catch up on each other's lives over a cuppa at home and on the go at work. He's got kids. What? Boys. Nick. You've been had. Haven't you? Yeah. Each episode found that perfect balance between the professional and personal stories, a trick that not many detective dramas have achieved either before or since. You all right? Yeah, I just never... ever charged anyone for murder before and felt sorry for 'em. She strangled and hanged an 18-year-old girl and then murdered her unborn baby. What's to feel sorry for? In April 2016, after five series and 33 episodes, Scott 81 Bailey solved their last crime. Coming UPI a grumpy Scotsman, a national treasure, and a straight-talking Geordie, but who have the ITV audience voted in at number one? Welcome back. For our next detective, you've voted for someone from the early 1980s that offered something a bit different. He didn't prowl the mean streets of New York or London, Hawaii was this character's playground. And he complemented the colourful location with his loud shirts, and even louder bright red Ferrari. REVS Welcome to the weird and wonderful world of Magnum Pl. Dan Cook was murdered, and I'm gonna prove it. The setup for the show was different, to say the least. Thomas Magnum, played by moustachioed heart—throb Tom Selleck, was a Vietnam veteran who lived in Robin's Nest, the palatial estate of elusive author Robin Masters, never seen, but voiced by Orson Welles, no less. In return for running the occasional security check on the property, Magnum got to live rent free and have access to Master's Ferrari. Oh, and he occasionally did a bit of private investigating on the side. Magnum wasn't just about the man himself, though. There was his love—hate relationship with Jonathan Higgins, the caretaker for Robin's Nest, who didn't always approve of Magnum's lifestyle. Argh! Higgins! Magnum also had two sidekicks who'd both served with him in Vietnam, Rick, who owned a local beach club, and TC, who conveniently ran a helicopter company. Magnum, of course, was more about the aesthetic than the plot, so each week you'd pretty much be guaranteed a car chase, a shootout, helicopter stunt, fist fight, and a little bit of romance for the star turn. But it was a formula that clearly worked. In America in 1988, the crime classic finale had well over 50 million viewers glued to their screens. It made a star of Tom Selleck, and of course, his moustache. In April 2013, a crime novel was published called The Cuckoo's Calling, written by newcomer Robert Galbraith. The book received good reviews, but didn't shift a huge number of copies. Then the Sunday Times newspaper did some detective work of its own and revealed that Robert Galbraith was the pseudonym of one jK Rowling. Sales of the book immediately soared, and before Rowling's secret was revealed, the BBC were already looking to bring Strike to our TV screens. The story featured a new private detective who went by the name of Cormoran Strike, a war veteran who lost part of his leg while serving in Afghanistan. Strike worked out of a tiny office on Denmark Street in London. Each story followed the structure of a classic whodunnit, with Strike, played by Tom Burke, being ably assisted by Holliday Grainger, playing Robin. I'm Robin. Robin Ellacott. Cormoran. Just popping out. Um... Where shall I say you are if anyone important calls? Down the boozer. Don't worry, they won't. Strike's personal life was a mess, but underneath the chaotic exterior was a brilliant mind that worked at its best when Robin was by his side. And then the next camera. That's after Lula fell. Yeah. Same guy walking quickly away, less agitated, more purposeful. Well, it's not the same guy. Why do you say that? Because his hoodie's got a thingy, a logo, on. Exactly, yeah. These are two different people. We can't see this guy's face, but look at his hands. Leather gloves. Guy Some dropped a hoodie and gloves off to the Deeby Macc flat. So he could have used the clothes as a disguise. Yeah. I need to speak to Guy Some. Tom Burke has said, as long as Rowling keeps writing the novels, Strike and Robin will be back for more. So for detective fans, there could be many more Strike mysteries to come. In the early 1980s, the TV detective genre was largely a male—dominated one. So, a producer in America, by the name of Barney Rosenzweig, came up with the idea of creating an all-female detective duo that would work the mean streets of New York City. Originally conceived as a film, the concept was rejected by all the major studios, so it was then reworked and turned into a TV series. A series that went by the name of Cagney 81 Lacey. However, the Cagney 81 Lacey we know and love weren't always portrayed by Sharon Gless and Tyne Daly. Christine Cagney was in fact played by two other actresses. In the pilot episode, Loretta Swit took the role, but wasn't available when the show was given a full season. Meg Foster was then cast in the part, but poor ratings meant the show was cancelled. However, CBS were eventually talked into making a second series, and in 1982, the show returned with Sharon Gless in the role of Cagney. This time, the programme was a hit. What did you want me to do this morning? Sign the form anyhow? Tell them I saw a gun I did not see? No, what I... Why don't we just forget it, huh? Why don't we just finish it? The show was unique, as it wasn't about two cops who happened to be women, it was about two women who happened to be cops. And it wasn't afraid to tackle some of the important issues of the day, like abortion, apartheid, officer-involved shootings, and alcoholism. Thrown into the mix were the characters' different political beliefs and backgrounds, which often led to conflict. All right, I did not come here because I needed some kind of work to help pay the orthodontist. This means something to me. What the hell are we talking about here? What we're talking about here is that our butts are on the line every time we go out that door. Now, that gun was there and you didn't see it. The show made stars of Daly and Gless, who shared the Emmy award for Best Actress six years in a row. It was hugely influential, and plays an important role in the history of both the female detective and television itself. In the early 1980s, ITV had a gap in their schedule. There wasn't a regular detective series on the channel. # All around me Are familiar faces... # Show producer Robert Love and writer Glenn Chandler put their heads together and came up with a whodunnit that featured a streetwise Glasgow detective. The three—part series was a murder mystery that went by the name of Killer and was first broadcast in 1983. The police officer who worked the case was Detective Chief lnspectorjim... Taggart. She knows something, I am convinced of it. Bring her in. Sir, I've put the wind up her. I don't want it to blow her away. Brought to life by actor Mark McManus, he was soon to become a household name, when, in 1985, the character appeared on our screens again in a show called Taggart. What's the connection between him and Telfer? Apart from the fact they both need an undertaker? This gritty slice of Glasgow's urban reality would go on to become one of the longest-running detective series in British television history. Get on with it, then. Take two. Action. In total, there were 110 episodes of Taggart produced over 27 years, and one of the main reasons for the programme's initial success was the man cast in the title role. For 11 years, Mark McManus played the role of Taggart... Going UP? ...and became one of the most recognisable faces on TV. I had Mark McManus in mind from the very first moment I started to write Killer. Get your skates on, Peter, we've got a severed leg near the Erskine Bridge. Human? No, the kind you put mint sauce on. He was the one Scottish face that I could... I could put behind these words. I'd seen him on television and thought, he's a great person to keep in mind. Robert Love gave the script to Mark, and the story, I believe, is that he read it on the train going to London, phoned Robert as soon as he got to London and said, "| want to do this." He imbued this old-fashioned, tough-talking, no-nonsense detective with a wicked sense of humour that was a hit with the audiences. The one-liner that everybody quotes that Taggart never spoke was, "There's been a murder." Because Taggart never said that, you see, it was always somebody else who said it to him. There's been another murder. Away from the cameras, though, McManus was going through a difficult time and battling some personal demons of his own. The first episode of series 11 saw the character of Taggart take a reduced role. I'm in no mood to be messed about! Where are the drugs? And sadly, in june 1994, aged 59, Mark McManus passed away. Off home? Aye. Off home. This episode would be the last to feature jim Taggart. I spent four years working with him until he died, and he was a unique person on and off-screen, and I think we always said that we learned from Mark. And that was on and off, because on screen, he knew exactly what he was doing. Before his death, Mark made it clear to producer Robert Love that he wanted the show to continue without him. Love was able to honour those wishes, firstly by giving the character of Taggart a funeral on screen, then with the original cast... Are you ready, sir? ...and some new faces joining them. Robbie Ross. Burke. Taggart continued on our screens for another 16 years, eventually airing its final episode in 2010. The character of Taggart might have appeared in fewer than half of the episodes of the series to which he lent his name, but his influence remained, and it was the popularity of the character that allowed the programme to endure even after he was gone. For our next detective, we're going back in time to one of the most turbulent periods in history. This detective operated on the streets of Hastings during World War ll, and was often called on to catch criminals taking advantage of the confusion created by the ongoing conflict. Kept out of the war, he devotes his time to solving homeland crimes, and his name is Detective Chief Superintendent Christopher Foyle. Foyle's War came from the mind of Anthony Horowitz, bestselling author of the Alex Rider novels. It seemed to me very interesting to come upon a situation where, just across the Channel, every day, hundreds of people are being killed, and yet a detective in England is being asked to solve one murder in an English library, somebody with a knife in their back, and it was the sort of dichotomy between those two that got me excited and that was the beginning of Foyle's War. Foyle's War was his passion project, and gave him the chance to tell a multi-layered detective story based on real events for a new detective series. The first episode hit screens in October 2002, and introduced audiences to Foyle, brought to life by the brilliant Michael Kitchen, a man frustrated by his lack of impact on the war effort. The answer's no, Foyle, and this time it's final. You know, if you weren't so damned obstinate, you'd see that I'm actually on your side. You do a good job. No telling where you might be once the war's over. It'll depend on who wins, I suppose. Michael Kitchen is a wonderful actor to work with, because he can do so much by saying so little, and that's fantastic for a writer like me to play with. Like all detectives, Foyle had a bit of help in the shape of Detective Sergeant Paul Milner, played by Anthony Howell. Morning, Sergeant. Sir. Thought you might like a lift. And most memorably, his driver, Samantha 'Sam' Stewart, played by Honeysuckle Weeks. I've been assigned to you as your new driver. Uh... Stewart? Samantha Stewart, sir. You can call me Sam. It's always a hoot on set. I loved the show. You know, I've kind of grown up with Foyle's War. I was but a mere girl of 21 when we did the pilot. It means the world to me, this show. The show prided itself on its historical attention to detail... Get undercover! SCREAMING Can't you hear?! ...with many of the plots incorporating actual wartime events and news stories. Get down! The way it's created, the artistry, the writing, it's immaculately done, you know. Everything is... The attention to detail that is paid in every area of the production is just... I mean, I don't think there's anything quite like it as a show. Dead body, knife in the back. Nice straightforward bit of detective work for you. Noticeable overuse of the word straightforward this morning, bearing in mind nothing in this place ever is. After eight series over 13 years, Foyle's War finally came to an end in 2015. And as Foyle ended his story employed by the mysterious world of Ml5, the door could always reopen for more cases. Don't go anywhere. There are lots more super sleuths still to come, including a female trailblazer, a mysterious police boss... Whoa! ..and a returning familiar face. Who did you vote for as Britain's Favourite Detective? Welcome back to our countdown to crown Britain's Favourite Detective, and welcome to Edinburgh, the capital of Scotland, and the location for crime writer Ian Rankin's uncompromising detective. Forget picturesque castles and stunning landscapes, this TV series was to show a dark underbelly of the Celtic city. Investigations led this senior officer through the city's ancient beauty and into its more sinister quarters, with poverty, corruption and social issues at the heart of the drama. The city is as much a central character as the protagonist himself. He was a world-weary, pessimistic detective who stalked the streets of Edinburgh on a mission to rid the city of crime and injustice, and went by the name of Rebus. A rebus is a picture puzzle. I was an English student at the time. I thought, what a great name, call him rebus. We've got Inspector Morse, which is a kind of code, and now we'll have Rebus, which is a kind of puzzle. The first Rebus story was published in 1987, but it took 13 years before the dark-souled detective made it to TV. Played originally by john Hannah in 2000, it was Ken Stott who took over the role in 2006 and embodied the character. PHONE RINGS Rebus. Stott, with his gravelly voice, gruff mannerisms, and aura of grumpiness, was born to play the hardened Scottish detective. Better? He's not a perfect human being, and I suppose we identify with that as well, because we know we're not perfect. He has his problems, you know, he drinks too much, his life's a mess. Fuelled by a potent mixture of booze, cigarettes and anger, the unkempt detective was at his happiest when watching football alone in his favourite pub. He was insubordinate and didn't play by the rules. He doesn't care about what people think of him. He's not afraid of authority. I think we all want to be unafraid of authority. The feeling is, you have to get yourself under control. They want you to have some counselling with a police therapist. This is a windup. You don't have any choice. This is the last chance saloon for you. Rebus was a complex character and the ultimate maverick cop. This hard drinking, hard smoking, and generally hard detective inspector established Ian Rankin as one of Britain's biggest crime writers, and the king of tartan noir. Ian Rankin's books are never out of the charts, are they? There must be something about the character of Rebus that captures the imagination that people... ...latch onto. From New Order and the Strangeways riots, to Happy Mondays and the Hacienda, Manchester clearly made its mark on the world in the 1990s. It was a time when forensic psychology was an emerging science, being used as a tool to catch criminals. Writer jimmy McGovern was tasked with creating a detective who wasn't actually a detective but a forensic psychologist, and so the character of Dr Edward 'Fitz' Fitzgerald was born. He first graced our screens in 1993, and working alongside a team of actual detectives, became one of the most iconic crime—fighters of the '90s in Cracker. Dr Fitzgerald is now ready to give us his lecture. The character of Fitz, brought to life brilliantly by Robbie Coltrane, was a walking contradiction. A chain-smoking, alcoholic, gambling addict with a foul mouth, who was also a cerebral and brilliant genius specialising in criminal psychology. It was a challenging part, and that's what you want to do if you do anything, do something that's very difficult as well as you can, don't you? Get a chance to show what you can do. More antihero than hero, Fitz worked to keep his demons at bay. What are you doing?! We're going for a walk right now. You and me. He's not a great role model as a dad or a husband, though, I have to say. But all great men have great faults, they say, and that's one of the things I liked about the character. I do not have to hide my booze, I am not an adolescent. All the evidence points to the contrary. It wasn't just the lead character that made Cracker unique. The show didn't follow the set formula of good versus bad. People will say, "He was a killer, he was a butcher, "but he did one decent thing... "He confessed so they could bury their daughter." It also wasn't afraid to stretch out its storylines across multiple episodes, with each one ending on a cliffhanger. It's the one last decent thing you can do. Also central to Cracker's success was the show's willingness to base episodes around real-life events. One such example was the chilling story To Be Somebody. If you're gonna do a TV drama, it's gonna be a TV drama warts and all, and I'm not going to toe the PC line, I'm going to have people who are racist, you know, who are sexist. It's gonna be full of real life, all the warts and all. McGovern used antagonist Albie as a way to bring to life his feelings about, and reaction to, the Hillsborough disaster. It's like all these things, if you do it right, it's not a problem, it's only bad if you're disrespectful to it or sensationalise it, or treat it in a shallow and sensational way, which jimmy never would. The three—part story was memorable for many reasons, but chief amongst them was a star-making turn from Robert Carlyle. # L—I—V # E—R—P # O-O-L, Liverpool FC Celtic! # L-I-V, E-R-P O-O-L, Liverpool FC... # And it's in the scenes between Robbie Coltrane and Robert Carlyle where Cracker showcases another of its calling cards, the superbly written staged and performed interrogation scenes. Peter Sutcliffe gets letters from women. He sends them signed photographs of himself with little kisses on the bottom. He's a somebody. Don't. Don't compare you with him? Yeah. Why not? You want to be a somebody, Albie, don't you? I really, really love the interviews, just cos of their intensity, and, you know, as an actor, you'd a chance to really show what you can do. Underneath, you're a good man. Dig deep and we'll find sensitivity. No, dig deep and we'll find sentimentality. It's been in every killer I've ever met. Sickening sentimentality. On a personal level, of course, I really enjoyed it. I really, really enjoyed it. You come in in the morning and think, "Oh, God, this is the bit where he breaks down. "Boy, this is gonna be good." He's buried on my father's allotment. Mind his runner beans when you're digging. It was a formula that clearly worked. The first episode pulled in an audience of nine million viewers, and at its peak, the series was attracting figures of 15 million plus. In 2006, after 13 years, three series, two specials, and six BAFTAs, Cracker came to an end. Oxford, one of the most iconic cities in England. Famous for its historic buildings, prestigious university, and as the backdrop for our next series. Popular both in the UK and internationally, it brought tourists flocking from around the world to tread in this detective's famous footsteps. As Watson is to Sherlock, it was the relationship between these two unlikely allies in Inspector Morse which lay at the heart of the series, and gave the show its popularity. Even the lead character's death could not end the saga. But the next detective you voted for proved that the sidekick is as important as the lead, when, in 2006, after a five-year absence, an old favourite came back to his former stomping ground, and over 11 million viewers tuned in to see the return of Lewis. Kevin Whately reprised the role of Robbie Lewis, Morse's sergeant in the original series. He'd now been promoted to the rank of detective inspector and was assisted by DS james Hathaway, played by Laurence Fox. This time round, it was Hathaway who had to earn his stripes. Has Oxford changed much since you've been away? Nope. It changed before I went. With murder and intrigue still at the heart of the drama, the series would continue to keep viewers gripped. GUNSHOT It's very important to have fairly complex plots in this, partly because it's two hours, partly because it's Oxford, so you expect it to be pretty cerebral, but I think audiences like to be a bit bamboozled as well. And the ghost of Morse was never far away. Whoa! TYRES SCREECH Morse. Can still see the stain from his gloss. In the first episode, we found Lewis struggling to fit back in, and new boss, Chief Superintendent jean Innocent, wasn't his biggest fan. You're never letting a sergeant run a murder investigation while I'm kicking my heels. At least let me earn my keep. You can head up the murder. Thank you, ma'am. But only until DI Grainger's available to take over. On hand to lend a friendly ear and some much-needed support was a familiar face from the old days, Dr Laura Hobson. So, what have we got? Sir. Scene suit, sir. Nah, I'll not bother, thanks. Uh... They're all the rage these clays. You'd better. Give it here, then. Romantic tensions simmered between the pair throughout the series. 0w! Well, I think I'll leave you guys to, um... get on with it. And theirs wasn't the only relationship that blossomed. It was Hathaway's logic and Morse-like deduction that made Lewis realise what really mattered to him. Do you love Laura? Then go. Show her that you love her. Don't assume that she knows. People make that assumption and it's a mistake. I think I've been a bit of a fool. Well... Actually, I've been a lot of a fool. All good things must come to an end, and after nine series, Whately was ready to call time on Lewis. The series was to finish as it had begun, with Lewis and Hathaway at the airport. You'll be missed. Better be. In 2015, with the ghost of Morse firmly laid to rest, Lewis flew off into the sunset with a new partner in crime. In 1997, a new kind of detective magically appeared on our screens. Living in a windmill in rural England, your regular everyday Mr Nice Guy lived quietly, engrossed in creating his magic tricks. His attention to detail provided him with the tools to become an unassuming amateur sleuth. A quietly reflective genius, he was a return to the old school cerebral detective that relied on his little grey cells to decipher a mystery with pinpoint precision. He was Jonathan Creek. Stand-up comedian Alan Davies landed the lead part in his first acting role which would turn him into a household name. Combining comedy, magic tricks, and elaborate murder mystery, Jonathan Creek transformed the whodunnit into the howdunnit. Finding a culprit would still be part of the detective's job, but the emphasis would be on discovering how the crime was committed. What happened? She's been stabbed. But how? No—one came in or out of the room. I would have seen. We all would have seen. There was nobody here. The whole thing is impossible. Every detective needs a sidekick. Pushy writer and journalist Maddy Magellan was written for and played by Caroline Quentin to solve crimes where others had failed. The sexual tension was there from the very beginning, and their will—they—won't—they relationship left viewers gripped. OK, get me down. Then I'll explain our next move. Just let me und... What do you mean our next move? The first three series saw Jonathan in the middle of some baffling cases after being duped into some grisly murder investigations by Maddy. Why was that rubber band on the bedroom floor? Why was the letter on the doormat? Why would someone fire bullets through the middle of a painting? Well, why would they? First, clear your mind of all preconceptions. This is more calculated and evil than we imagined. Good night. Night. Caroline Quentin was to leave the series in 2000, but would be followed by three further sidekicks. Firstly, Carla Borrego, played by julia Sawalha, then yours truly as joey Ross, until finally, Creek's wife Polly, played by Sarah Alexander, became his reluctant assistant. WHISPERS: You know what to do. I just need three minutes. WHISPERS: I can't. I can't do this sort of thing. How am I supposed to just suddenly pretend to scream in agony? I don't know. Remember when you got halfway through Piers Morgan's memoirs. Just call on some of that. In 2016, after five series and 32 episodes, the curly-haired investigator solved his last case. Whether he'll make a welcome return to our screens remains a mystery. Set in the 1990s on the metropolitan streets of London, an urban backdrop was to be the location for this trailblazing British TV detective. She was a character who was prickly, complicated, but deeply human, and was prime to take on the overtly male establishment. And for the creator Lynda LaPlante, there was only one woman for the job. Helen Mirren was cast as the no-nonsense DCI that is... DCI Tennison. ...in Prime Suspect. Prime Suspect was ground-breaking. It was rare to have a woman leading the drama. There was great fear in the television company of making something that had a female character driving the story. I don't think they were at all convinced that it was going to be successful. What do you think? About what, sir? My voice suddenly got lower, has it? Maybe my knickers are too tight. Listen, I like to be called Governor or the boss, I don't like ma'am, I'm not the bloody Queen, so take your pick. Yes, ma'am. SIGHS After the detective in charge of a gruesome murder investigation suffers a heart attack, Tennison seeks to prove her worth by taking charge of the case. I am not attempting to step into his shoes. No-one could. But as the first available DCI, all I ask of you is your undivided loyalty and attention. Does anyone have anything to say? I do. Look, I know you asked for this case specifically... You don't like it, put in for a transfer. From the very beginning, we witnessed her constant battles to prove herself in a male—dominated world. The first episode directly addressed the institutionalised sexism that exists within the police force. Make it your business to get on with her. That an order? Yes. DS Bill Otley was the constant thorn in Jane's side, undermining her authority at every opportunity. Any word on what the readers survey came up with, ma'am? But she always gave as good as she got. For or against female DCls on homicides. ALL: Ooh! Oh, you're a biased load of old chauvinists and there's thousands more like you. You could always get a job in pantomime. The show earned a reputation for its attention to detail and pulled no punches. I'd like to have a look, please. Are you sure? It's not a pretty sight. I want to see her face. A departure from her previous more glamorous roles, it took Helen Mirren's career in a new direction. It proved that she was not only an accomplished actress, but the series became iconic due to her performance. I did recognise it was a great role, and you know, I loved the script. I thought it was great, but you never know how it's gonna come out. Mirren won three BAFTA TV awards for Best Actress in the role, and jane Tennison was immortalised in wax at Madame Tussauds. After all those awards, it was inevitable that DCI Tennison would return, and after a seven-year gap, she did in 2003. But in 2006, the final series saw her slowly unravel as she increasingly relied upon alcohol to help her cope, making the difficult decision to retire from the police force. I can't believe you're really leaving. Well, I've had a good run. You know. Dozens of convictions, three commendations, two for bravery, one for excellence. More than most. First female DCI. First Jane Tennison DCI. Sorry, ma'am. Don't call me ma'am, I'm not the bloody Queen. After two decades, seven series, and a total of 30 hours prime—time detective drama, we said a fond farewell to DCI jane Tennison. SIRENS Next, we're off on our travels to Midsomer... GUNSHOT Ah! Danton, and Oxford, to meet some more crime—busting detectives. Have you solved the mystery of who you voted number one yet? Welcome back. The countdown to Britain's Favourite Detective continues, and we're off to Yorkshire and the fictional town of Denton, where this unconventional policeman resides. Sloppy, disorganised and disrespectful, he attracted trouble like a magnet. With a dislike for authority, he had a no-nonsense approach to crime-fighting. This role put David jason on the map as a dramatic actor, playing Detective Inspector jack Frost. This was a different side to David jason then we'd ever seen before. I thought that perhaps it was time for a change, and maybe something I haven't been involved in is drama, and they asked me, "Would you like to do a police series?" And so I thought, yeah, I wanna give it a go now. I'd like to be a policeman and arrest people, basically. And with a bark that was worse than his bite, he made this character his own. I'm Niamh Cusack and I'm playing Sally Burland. Bruce Alexander playing Mullett. I am Touch Of Frost. LAUGHTER He had many sidekicks over the years, but his most regarded and highly valued were Detective Sergeant George Toolan... Morning, George. How do you fancy a cup of coffee and a nice sticky bun? It's only three clays old, so eat it while it's fresh-ish. ...and DS Clive Barnard, who made a welcome return to his team. Clive. What the hell are you doing here? Waiting for you, Governor. Theirs was a partnership filled with respect, admiration, and banter. Hey, is that your George Cross? Yes, it is, but don't you lust after it, that's for heroes only. One of the most unexpected shocking moments came in series five when Frost and Barnard arrive at a house to make an arrest. A man doesn't have to be brave to pull the trigger. But he must be brave enough to face the consequences. GUNSHOT It was a moment of high drama when two gunshots were fired. GUNSHOT And we were left on the edge of our seats wondering who had survived. I said, I think he has to die. "You can't have him die." I said, "But it's going to be a shock to the audience." But it gave us somewhere to go, somewhere different, and somewhere we hadn't been before. It was a testament to Jason's acting skills during the heartbreaking scene when Frost gave Barnard his treasured George Cross and said goodbye to his colleague and friend. You deserve this. More than I ever did. That was a very emotional scene to have to play. Underneath the tough exterior, he's always had a twinkle in his eye, and over the years has not been short of female admirers. Although they've never seemed to last. That is until the final series when he met Christine Moorhead, played by Downton Abbey's Phyllis Logan. PHONE RINGS I'm sorry. Excuse me. Frost. Frost's happiness was short lived, when, on his wedding day, tragedy struck, and in the last ever episode, we were left on a cliffhanger once again, wondering who had made it out alive. Here we are, jack. Thank you. And George. After almost two decades, David jason decided that it was time for DCI jack Frost to retire. It was a great wrench to come to that decision, but the point was that time has caught up with us, really. As a real, um... policeman, if I were a real policeman, I would have retired probably about ten years ago. After 17 years and 47 clays, that's the end of A Touch Of Frost. APPLAUSE It's an end of an era in a way, it's not just the end of Frost, it's an end of... Well, sort of way of life in a way. Very sad. Very sad. In America in the mid—'80s, the CBS network were interested in creating a new mystery series, and they wanted that series to be led by a woman. William Link and Richard Levinson, two of the writers behind Columbo, were charged with the task of creating a female detective who wasn't gonna be bailed out by men. They came up with a widow who lived in a tranquil coastal community of Cabot Cove in Maine. First, she took up writing mystery novels, and then she took up solving crimes. Her name was Jessica Fletcher. Murder, She Wrote was first broadcast in America in 1984 and was an instant success, thanks in main to the iconic performance by Angela Lansbury in the lead role. CLEARS THROAT I beg your pardon, Chief Gunderson, I was just checking something out. I probably should have asked you first, but I didn't disturb any evidence, believe me. I read your book. Oh, you did? How nice. Didn't say I liked it, said I read it. In fact, such was the success of Murder, She Wrote that, for a series three episode, the producers decided to cross over with another CBS show, Magnum Pl, with Jessica trying to prove that Thomas Magnum is innocent of the crimes he's been imprisoned for. As a professional, if you were out, what would you do? Well, I'd talk to Arthur Houston and get some answers. Well, Mr Magnum, since you can't, I will. Angela Lansbury received ten Best Actress Golden Globe nominations for playing Jessica Fletcher, taking home the award on four occasions. And that's why you voted Jessica Fletcher as one of the best TV detectives in the business. We've reached the top ten, and we're off to the English countryside and the chocolate box villages and quaint market towns of Buckinghamshire and Oxfordshire. But looks can be deceptive, and behind this genteel setting, these stunning locations provide the picturesque but deadly backdrop for the fictional county of Midsomer. With a high body count in every episode, all is never quite as it seems in Midsomer Murders. When Midsomer Murders first hit our screens in 1997, Detective Chief Inspector Tom Barnaby, played by john Nettles, was already a familiar face to TV detective fans as the grumpy heart—throb Bergerac. But six years on, Nettles was playing a very different kind of detective. It's Delia Smith. A married police officer with a calm demeanour and dry caustic wit. You can't go wrong with Delia Smith. Yeah, that's what I'd always thought. Based in the force headquarters in Causton, it wasn't long before the couple discovered that life wasn't quite as tranquil as they'd anticipated. Behind the net curtains in the sleepy suburbs lurked suspicious, shady eccentrics with their noses in everyone's business. It was their grudges and anger that often result in the grisliest and occasionally wackiest of murders. Arghg Ah! GASPS With an average of 2.6 murders per episode, anyone, anywhere could become a murder victim in this county. You wouldn't think, would you, one small village would have so much trouble bubbling away under the surface? Midsomer, I don't know, we killed more people than you can shake a stick at, and it was thought at one time that it was getting a bit ludicrous, and therefore the murder count should be reduced somewhat. When we tried to do that, there were complaints. People didn't like it very much, and that's part of the joy, is the... the joke, if you like, is the sheer number of murders in Midsomer. After over 80 episodes and hundreds of murders, in 2011, john Nettles decided that it was time for a change. Conscious that Barnaby was becoming the oldest detective in the business, it was time to take a step back. We're going on a long holiday. But I've... Well, we've decided that that holiday... will be indefinite. I am retiring. Thankfully for the area's residents, another member of the Barnaby clan was ready and willing to pick up the mantle. Cue Tom's younger cousin, DCI john Barnaby, played by Neil Dudgeon. I do hope the residents can curb their murderous inclinations while he's here. I doubt it. LAUGHTER Nearly a decade and eight series on, john Barnaby is still solving murders in Midsomer and entertaining audiences in over 225 territories around the world. So, who was meant to die? The magician? Or the public? Still to come, we'll be counting down from nine to one with some of the toughest cops to hit our screens in recent times, along with a couple of senior sleuths. But will any of these be the one you voted Britain's Favourite Detective? Welcome back. In the spring of 2013, a new detecting duo made its way into viewers' living rooms courtesy of ITV. These two coppers didn't walk the mean streets of a major metropolitan area, though. Their beat was a much more quiet and tranquil location. This was the setting for a whodunnit that gripped the nation over the course of eight weeks. As DI Alec Hardy and DS Ellie Miller try to crack the case of who killed Danny Latimer in the sleepy West Country seaside village of Broadchurch. Hardy and Miller, brought to life by David Tennant and Olivia Colman, took centre stage in one of the most gripping and complex murder mysteries to grace our screens in recent times. Oh, God, don't do this to me. Arriving on ITV on 4th March 2013, what appeared at first to be a simple whodunnit turned into a sprawling mystery with a multitude of suspects that had viewers on the edge of their seats until the gripping final episode. Central to that mystery was the complicated relationship between the two detectives. Oh, God, no, no, no. Off the beach! Hey, this area's off-limits! No, I'm police! Oh, God. Hardy himself is haunted by his failure to solve another murder case, and his initial exchanges with Miller are frosty, to say the least. You can't make it better, don't try. You don't how I work. Watch them. Every move. Anything that doesn't make sense, you tell me. OK. Don't look at me like that. They're a slightly unconventional crime-fighting duo. They're not really Cagney 8; Lacey, are they? No. I can't actually think of a... of a similar duo. We don't like each other very much. Don't really get on. They come from slightly different worlds. Despite this, as the case builds, so does the relationship between the two detectives, and they are there for each other even in the most difficult moments. You're wrong. I'm not. SOBS Broadchurch got its casting spot on, pairing two actors at the precise moment they were about to be acknowledged as the leading male and female screen talents of their generation. With a stellar supporting cast, including rising stars Vicky McClure and jodie Whittaker. The series proved to be a ratings hit, with millions of viewers gripped over its eight-week run. This led to BAFTA awards for Olivia Colman, and for the show itself. Two more series followed, but it was the first, with its complex central mystery, and the relationship between the two dogged detectives, that cemented their place with the audience. The majority of detective dramas are pretty black-and-white. The cops are the good guys and the criminals are the bad guys. But in 2012, a new crime drama hit UK screens which dared to ask the question, who polices the police? Set in a fictional Midlands city, the show began life on BBC Two, but the word-of-mouth it generated and the popularity amongst viewers saw it quickly promoted to a prime—time BBC One slot. The detectives at the heart of the show were Steve Arnott and Kate Fleming, who work for the anti—corruption unit that goes by the name of AC—12. There's only one thing we're interested in here, son, and one thing only... ...and that's bent coppers. The job of AC—12 was to tackle corruption within the police, and Arnott and Fleming, played by Martin Compston and Vicky McClure, work under the watchful eye of Superintendent Ted Hastings, played by Adrian Dunbar, who's made it his duty to rid the force of... Bent coppers. Each series concentrates on a different case, with the chief antagonist often played by some of the biggest names in UK TV. However, in the case of Line Of Duty, the bigger the name, the more likely the character being played will meet with a sticky end. GUNSHOT Shot fired! This trend was set from series one when Tony Gates, played by Lennie James, exited the show in dramatic fashion. TYRES SCREECH Since then, actors including Stephen Graham, Keeley Hawes, and Daniel Mays, have all fallen foul of the Line Of Duty call. CHAINSAW BUZZES GUNSHOT But if there's one thing that sets Line Of Duty apart from other detective dramas, it's the lengthy, intense stand-offs in the interrogation room. Anti—corrupti0n Unit 12 interviewed by Superintendent Hastings. These tightly scripted and brilliantly acted moments are peppered throughout the show, and in series three, reached their peak, as Fleming used her skills to bring down fellow AC—12 officer Dot. Say that again. You just said you were in your flat. We have that on tape. Uh... It's a very simple matter, DI Cotton. DI Cotton has answered, haven't you, DI Cotton? You've mentioned when questioned something you later intend to rely on in court. And this episode offered further surprises, as, just as it looked like Dot had nowhere to run, the programme makers pulled out another superbly crafted twist. GUNSHOTS Of course, that didn't stop Fleming ultimately getting her man. As well as the individual cases, there was also an ongoing story arc that has sustained across all five series of Line Of Duty, the identity of the mysterious H, the copper at the top of the corruption tree. Literally anyone could be the big bad, with suspicion even falling on Hastings himself. There's a line, it's called right and wrong, and I know which side my duty lies. One thing's for certain, when Line Of Duty finally ends, it will be Fleming and Arnott who bring down H. In 2010, a new detective was introduced to TV viewers. His mission was to clean up the streets of London. Ostensibly a good guy, this maverick police officer did, however, operate on the very edges of the law, almost blurring the lines between good and evil. His cases were often grisly, and his quarry always dangerous. However, they'd quickly learn that they'd bitten off more than they could chew when they came face-to-face with DCI john Luther. Call him off. Brought to life by Idris Elba, it was clear from the off that Luther was a very different kind of detective... Right. You tell me where he is, or when they come for you, I'll let you just hang. Don't look at me, mate. Come on! ..who wasn't afraid to get his hands dirty if it meant getting a result. Where is he?! None of it... Tell me, now! As well as being a physical presence, he was a cerebral one too. Did I kill them? No. Can you prove that? I can't prove a negative. Can't be done. A trick that allowed Luther to show off his skills of deduction early. There. This is yawning. She didn't yawn. Yawning is contagious. Someone in the room yawns, you yawn too. See, even talking about it. It's to do with parts of the brain that deal with empathy. She didn't yawn. She did it. But it wasn't just Luther's intellect that defined the programme. It was his relationships with the other characters surrounding him. In particular, the complex interactions with killer and psychopath Alice, played by Ruth Wilson. You did it cos you needed to do it. And it's that compulsion that makes you weak in ways that you can't see or understand. And it's that compulsion that's gonna get you caught. And it will bring you down, Alice, it always does, just like clockwork. Are you threatening me? Because, honestly, I wouldn't. And why's that? Oh, come now, really? Across five series, they played out a will—they—won't—they storyline which saw Luther torn between bringing down or submitting to Alice. So go on. Kiss me. Kill me. Do something. Luther's relationship with his partner, however, proved much less complex. DCI john Luther, DS Justin Ripley. Morning, sir. Introduced in series one, justin Ripley at first seemed like an inconvenience to Luther. So, do we need to have the chat? A man who preferred to operate alone away from prying eyes. Want me to come with? No. Stay here. However, eventually, Ripley proved his worth, and their relationship went from one of colleagues to friends. He's my mate. I love him. But just as Luther accepted Ripley, he was taken away from him... ...in a heartbreaking scene during the third series of the show. Justin! Justin! Ripley! Hey! Hey! No! Not you. Not you. Hey! Get up! Justin! When a character exhibits such extreme methods for upholding the law, it was inevitable that DCI john Luther would eventually break it, and his last appearance on our screens in 2019 saw the character being led away in cuffs. Whether we'll see Luther fight crime again on the streets of London currently remains to be seen. Still to come, two of the smartest ladies in the business, and of course, we'll be revealing who won your vote for Britain's Favourite Detective. Welcome back. We're heading stateside next for a true detective icon. The backdrop for this crime-solving mastermind is the equally iconic City of Angels, Los Angeles. Behind the bumbling demeanour, scruffy raincoat and cigar lay a sharp mind and a brilliant investigator. He was a homicide detective with the Los Angeles Police Department. He is, of course... Columbo. Columbo was a crime drama starring Peter Falk, but he wasn't the first choice for the role. It was originally offered to crooner Bing Crosby, who, luckily for Falk, turned it down. Who are you? Uh... I'm just another cop. My name's Columbo, I'm a lieutenant. Falk said he loved the script as soon as he read it. The detective wasn't a cliche. He was compelling, eccentric and smart. In 1971, the first series episode was directed by a young unknown director called Steven Spielberg. He was the first director that had the camera across the street in the second store y window and he had a long lens on it. This is going back 40, 30 years ago. It's very common today. But it wasn't common on television, so I knew I was in the hands of somebody who was special. It wasn't just the shooting style that was different, Columbo bucked the TV trend at the time by crafting movie-length episodes, and pioneered a new technique in TV crime drama, by revealing the killer in the first act of the programme... GUNSHOT ...with Columbo then solving the plot. I must say I don't envy you. I don't envy myself. Now, look, I got a lot of phone calls to make, I'd better get on it. There were no car chases. Columbo had no gun, and no big action scenes. He appeared chaotic, but was always underestimated by his adversaries, and never failed to solve a crime. I kind of knew it right from the start. It was nothing definite, it was a lot of little things. Little things. Columbo's iconic raincoat was said to originally belong to Peter Falk, but that was a bit of a mystery in itself. I thought I read raincoat in the first script that I read, but the two guys who wrote the script said, "No, there was no raincoat in it," so I say that they put the raincoat in, they say I put the raincoat in, but at any rate, it is my coat. He was as famous for his dishevelled look as he was for his catchphrase, which would always mark the point when he'd found his prime suspect, and all that followed was getting the proof. One more thing, sir, it will only take a moment. The show made a star of Peter Falk, and he was the highest—paid actor in America. It was believed he earned $500,000 per episode by the final season, when, after 69 outings, he finally hung up the raincoat for good. Welcome to Northumberland. Best known for its sweeping sandy beaches, rolling dunes, high rocky cliffs, and our next TV detective. The female version of Columbo, with her dishevelled appearance and oversized raincoat, she has the ability to pick apart complex crimes. She's a stalwart, a problem solver, and with a no-nonsense attitude, she's the character that you immediately warm to. The stunning setting has become as much a star of the drama as the leading lady herself, Brenda Blethyn, playing DCI Vera Stanhope. This formidable detective, with a caustic wit, was the creation of acclaimed crime writer Ann Cleeves. Inspired by the resilient spinsters Ann remembers from her childhood, the straight-talking Vera was a hit with her readers from the off. Right, check eBay. Check the girl, check everyone. Check every drunk, every stag do, the lot. We've missed someone. Don't sit down. Come on. With no time for the trappings of make-up, fashion, romance or personal angst, solving a crime and seeing justice done are Vera's sole objectives. She's a dedicated police officer. It's her life, really, she's just totally dedicated to it. Someone climbs in the window, strangles our lad with a length of rope, and then places him in a warm tub like some poncy installation at the Baltic. And then there's his classmate, Tommy Sharp. Hilary's lad. Ooh, look! It woke up. THEY LAUGH Vera is absolutely a wonderful character. She's rather shambolic, she's not your normal, run-of-the-mill detective. If you saw her in the street, the last thing you'd think she was is a detective. She looks more like a bag lady, frankly. She's supremely intuitive. We love watching her deftly unpick complex mysteries whilst being intensely sympathetic to the victims of crime. Your son didn't take his own life. Right, come on, let's take ourselves off for a bit. She's so easy to talk to, and of course, it works very, very well for her when she's questioning somebody. You better arrest him, Joe! I could do with a decent meal. Brenda Blethyn embodies the character of Vera, and has kept us gripped with her portrayal for nearly ten years. Well, you were right. It is a bloodstain on the bat. Well, it's like I've done this before. This witty, salt of the earth, straight-talking Geordie is a firm favourite with audiences all over the world. At my time of life, it's wonderful when such a superb character lands in your lap. You know, I consider myself very, very fortunate. Across the years, the TV detective has taken on many different forms. Often, they're hard drinking, straight talking, physical and formidable presences, tasked with working the mean streets of a bustling metropolis. But one TV detective very much bucks that trend. She's small, unassuming, softly spoken, and almost genteel, much like the places she inhabits. But look a bit deeper underneath this unlikely exterior and you'll find one of the keenest criminologists to ever grace the screens. She lives in St Mary Mead and her name is Miss jane Marple. Marple first came to life in the pages of books rather than on our TV screens, courtesy of the pen of Agatha Christie. In total, 12 of Christie's novels feature the character of Marple, and her popularity meant that they were ripe for adaptation. Early versions of her character saw her appear on cinema screens with both Margaret Rutherford and Angela Lansbury taking on the role. In 1984, the first small screen adaptation launched on the BBC, and audiences were instantly hooked. Miss Marple! Miss Marple! Miss Marple! Telephone. Oh, thank you, Cherry. Joan Hickson perfectly captured the dainty, birdlike old lady who wasn't afraid to get involved in the very serious business of solving crime. Now, tell me, do you think Mrs Babcock was the intended victim? No, I thought she might not be. Well, who do you think it was, then? You are remarkable. In 2004, the character was revived again, this time on ITV... Are you up to something, Miss Marple? Am |? ...with Geraldine McEwan the next actress to inhabit the role. Would you mind strangling me, Elspeth? Not at all, Jane. Please don't mind us. And then in 2009, it was julia McKenzie's turn to breathe life into Miss Marple. There's so many ways to play Marple, and so many people have played it so many different ways, and everyone has their own idea of Marple, so I'm sure I won't please everyone, I just hope I please enough. It wasn't Lydia your brother forced himself on that night, was it? It wasn't Lydia who cried and begged him to stop. Do you mean that Honoria killed Florie? Amy? All the others? Yes. ITV approached the adaptations with great attention to detail, high production values, and a supporting cast made up of a who's who of British acting talent. While the actor portraying Marple has changed over the years, the character still remains one of the most popular fictional detectives, and it seems like only a matter of time before she graces our screens once more. Thank you, Miss Marple. Not at all. From Taggart to Tennison, Fletcher to Fitz, and Magnum to Marple, we've counted down some of the finest TV detectives that you, the ITV audience, has voted for, but there are still three more to go, so who's missing from the countdown so far? And who will be crowned Britain's Favourite Detective? Welcome back to Britain's Favourite Detective, and we've reached the home stretch, and another of Agatha Christie's creations. Although he shares Miss Marple's keen eye and skills of deduction, he's much more of a globetrotter. Murder follows him everywhere, be it on a trip up the Nile, or a journey on the Orient Express. He's short, Belgian, and sports a flamboyant little moustache. He is, of course, Hercule Poirot. The popularity of Christie's novels has meant there have been multiple versions of Hercule Poirot seen in both TV and film. Actors including Albert Finney, Peter Ustinov, Kenneth Branagh, and john Malkovich have all breathed life into the Belgian detective. There is one adaptation, however, that the ITV audience have voted for in their droves. He played the part on television for 24 years across 70 episodes, and David Suchet remains the only actor to film every single story that featured Hercule Poirot. The show premiered in 1989 with the story entitled The Adventure of the Clapham Cook, and it was clear Suchet had done his research when it came to bringing his version of Agatha Christie's creation to life. A file of paper, a pen, and I started reading every single story. So I wrote a list of 93 little notes about his character. For me, it's the voice. Poirot is not really connected with his emotions. He's connected with his head. And therefore, I decided to give him a head sound. So, I could be talking to you as David Suchet, my voice is coming out from my emotions. Now it is in my mouth and now it is going higher, higher in my brain and I will put on his Belgian French accent and then I will speak as Hercule Poirot. What?! What?! How does she dare?! In 2004, Death On The Nile was produced featuring acting royalty like james Fox... Had you fooled there, Poirot, you old dog. Oh! ...and Frances de la Tour, alongside then rising star Emily Blunt. Filmed on location in Egypt, this lavish adaptation showed Suchet at his best as Poirot attempts to solve the complex murder of Linett Ridgeway. It seems as if you had thought of everything, Monsieur Doyle, except for one thing. Hercule Poirot. Then, in 2010, perhaps Poirot's best-known case, Murder On The Orient Express, was broadcast on ITV. Again, an all—star cast was in place, and again, the period detail was second to none. And as always, it was Poirot's reveal of whodunnit that was the star of the show. Notable this time as it threw the detective into turmoil as he wrestled with right and wrong. You behave like this and we become just... savages in the street. The juries and executioners that they elect themselves. No, it is medieval! The rule of law, it must be held high, and if it falls, you pick it up and hold it even higher! 2013 saw Suchet bring the curtain down on his time as Poirot. But the character will forever endure. He may be Belgian, but that didn't stop you voting him into the number three spot in Britain's Favourite Detective. In the mid—'80s, Central TV was under pressure to commission programmes with a regional identity. Head of Central, Ted Childs, also believed that ITV would benefit from some quality crime drama. Working with producer Kenny McBain, the novels of Colin Dexter, set in the city of Oxford, was seen as the perfect material to adapt for the small screen. The protagonist of those novels was one Inspector Morse. First appearing on our screens in 1987, Morse was brought to life by the late, great john Thaw. Driving the iconic red jaguar, his first appearance as the character brought to mind one of his previous roles as an action man in another detective drama, The Sweeney. It soon became clear, though, that Morse was a very different detective, one who used his mind to bring down criminals and murderers. What's the estimated time of death? No, no, don't tell me. Between seven and eight this evening. Don't know yet. Max is up there now. What makes you think you know? Just a hunch. Like all great detectives, Morse was of course nothing without his partner, the long-suffering Detective Sergeant Lewis. We're trying to keep people out of here. There's a hell of a crowd in there! Initially, the relationship between the two was a little frosty and unsure... Let's have a look at your face! But Lewis soon grew to become Morse's loyal right-hand man, acting as his sounding board, and on occasion, coming to his aid when Morse found himself in a spot of bother. Hang on. However, Lewis was never far away from being on the end of Morse's sharp tongue. I'm sorry, hang on. A pen and a bit of paper. Morse, though, was very much the star of the show, working tirelessly to solve the crimes put in front of him. Is this a dagger that I see before me? Just an ordinary kitchen knife, I think, sir. Brand — new, too. Bought for the purpose, I would say, but what purpose? What purpose? Though he always found time for a good pint and a good woman, with the reputation of being quite the ladies man. You got me all in a fret, driving like that. Oh, I'm sorry, it's being a policeman. Always in a hurry, and we are late. Always on the side of good, Morse's extracurricular activities and unorthodox approach did sometimes find him at odds with his superiors, and even, on occasion, under suspicion himself. I did not kill her. Now, someone, I don't know who, and I don't know why, is trying to frame me. It was these ingredients that made the show so incredibly popular with viewers. And in total, 33 episodes of the programme were produced. Such was the appetite for the character and the world he inhabited, two spin-off series followed. The first, as we've already seen, was Lewis, and then, in 2012, ITV launched the prequel series, Endeavour... You are whom? Morse. Detective Constable. ...that follows a younger Morse, played by Shaun Evans, working as a police constable in the 1960s. Squeamish, are we? You won't make much of a detective if you're not prepared to look death in the eye. And john Thaw's version of the character finally looked death in the eye when Colin Dexter decided to kill off Morse on the page. The 33rd episode of Inspector Morse, The Remorseful Day, would be the last. Inspector Morse is dead! Over 12 million viewers tuned in to see Inspector Morse become the 82nd and final body to appear in the programme. John Thaw's award-winning performance as the character created a fiercely loyal following, and is the reason why he is almost, but not quite, your choice for Britain's Favourite Detective. We've counted down from 25 to 2, and totted up your thousands of votes. So who is Britain's Favourite Detective? Well, I'd like to tell you, but it's a bit of a mystery. But I think, by now, you'll have realised who is conspicuous by their absence. He resides at 221B Baker Street in London and was created by the author Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. He would probably describe himself as the greatest detective, and it seems that the ITV audience agree, because our number one is of course Mr Sherlock Holmes. Created by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle in 1886, the character appeared in a total of 56 short stories and four novels, often accompanied on his cases by his able assistant Dr john Watson, whose involvement was a deliberate inclusion, as explained by Conan Doyle himself in this rare footage. I used to occasionally to read detective stories, but what annoyed me in the old—fashioned detective story, the detective always seemed to get his results either by some sort of lucky chance or a fluke, or else, it was quite unexplained how he got there. Well, once I began to think about this, I began to think of turning scientific methods, as it were, onto the work of detection. Holmes's scientific detection has been portrayed on the big screen by a wealth of different actors. From 1939 to 1946, Basil Rathbone took on the role, appearing in a total of 14 Sherlock Holmes films, and more recently, Robert Downey jr brought Holmes to life, appearing in two Hollywood blockbusters alongside jude Law in the role of Dr Watson. On the small screen, though, the character has proven just as popular, and one of the most memorable betrayals was by actor jeremy Brett. Mr Sherlock Holmes, I believe. I am Mr Holmes. From 1984 to 1994, Granada TV produced 41 episodes featuring Brett in the title role. His performance as Holmes was rightly lauded. Aided by the period production design, Brett showed a brooding, unsympathetic side to the character, and a slight hint of menace that made his Holmes stand out from the previous version seen before. My mind rebels at stagnation. Give me problems, give me work. Give me the most abstruse cryptogram, the most intricate analysis, and I'm in my proper atmosphere. The representation of genius is practically impossible if you're a person, you know, just like me. But that is... In all my endeavours, to try and get the quickness of mind, and the only way to let the audience in through the camera, is to kind of show the cracks in the marble. And I think, probably, in that endeavour, there is certainly a darker side to Holmes. What are we dealing with? Something new. In 2010, writers Mark Gatiss and Stephen Moffat decided to bring Holmes back to our TV screens. But with a bit of a twist. Rather than setting their series in 19th century London, they opted to adapt Doyle's original stories and transplant them to the modern day. Rising star Benedict Cumberbatch was cast in the role of Holmes, with Martin Freeman appearing alongside him as his faithful, long-suffering assistant Watson. GUNSHOTS What the hell are you doing?! Bored. What? Bored! This modern spin meant that, much like in the novels, Holmes embraced modern technology and practices. Do you wanna take us through it? The trousers, they're heavy duty. Polyester, nasty, same as the shirt. Cheap. They're both too big for him. So some kind of standard issue uniform. Dressed for work. What kind of work? The watch helps too. The alarm shows he did regular night shifts. Why regular? Maybe he just set his alarm the night before he died. No, no, the buttons are stiff. Hardly touched. There was some kind of badge or insignia on the shirt front that he tore off, suggesting he works somewhere recognisable, some kind of institution. Did a quick check. The Hickman Gallery has reported one of its attendants as missing. Alex Wood bridge. Fantastic. The technology and setting might be modern, but one tradition couldn't be messed with. Holmes had to come up against his most famous adversary. Every fairy tale needs a good old—fashioned villain. Holmes' arch nemesis Moriarty was introduced in series one, and this time, was portrayed by Andrew Scott. Do you know what happens if you don't leave me alone, Sherlock? To you? Oh, let me guess, I get killed. Kill you? No, don't be obvious. I mean, I'm gonna kill you anyway some day. I don't wanna rush it, though. A cat and mouse game between the two played out, culminating in a shocking finale in The Reichenbach Fall, where Arthur Conan Doyle's original ending was given a new twist when Moriarty took his own life, and Sherlock seemed to do the same. Sherlock! Sherlock... But anyone who knows their Sherlock Holmes knows that you can't keep a good detective down, and Sherlock returned from the dead with almost 13 million viewers in 2014. The show has been a smash hit for the BBC over four series, and turned Cumberbatch into a superstar. Cumberbatch's Holmes has been absent from our screens for a while, but it is testament to his portrayal, and to Conan Doyle's character, that the violin-playing sleuth continues to resonate with the audience, and has landed him the title of Britain's Favourite Detective. ALARMS SOUND So, there you have it. We've travelled across continents and eras to bring you the top 25 super sleuths that you voted for as Britain's Favourite Detective. From the hard-boiled and gritty, to the almost genteel, from the friends, to the foes, the scruffy and unassuming, to the bold and brilliant, all unique, and all at the top of their game, but there could only be one winner, and it simply had to be the detective in the deerstalker, Mr Sherlock Holmes, Britain's Favourite Detective. Oh... Put the hat on! Yeah, Sherlock, put it on. Just get it over with. APPLAUSE Subtitles by ITV signpost
