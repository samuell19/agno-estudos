OUTLAW What do you think you're doing? As I please. I'm doing as I please. Outlaw. Do you need a bag? Good evening! That'll be 3,368 roubles, please. Paying by card? Any offers? Paying together. OK, babe? He called. He's waiting. No. Bosch's known works to date only number 33. 25 paintings and eight drawings. He never signed them and rarely dated them. There's an opinion that Bosch was a member of the Brethren of the Free Spirit, whose adherents were called Adamites. What's that? Sodomites? Adamites. It's a heretical sect that appeared in the 13th century. - If you look closely at the painting... - Excuse me, I have... Well, basically, a question relevant to the subject of the lesson. In the picture there's a flower sticking out of a man's arse. And what is the question? Why's he got a flower sticking out of his arse? Funny fucking man. However, by the 17th century, people had drastically changed attitude to him. They accused Bosch of heresy. And gayness. I'm sorry. Erm... the new General Secretary... That's what Gorbachev said, yes. - But I can assure you! - No, that's out of the question. Two vodkas, some oysters, he likes them, and white wine to go with them. Don't get it wrong! So, Vladislav, here's the deal: you can pick anyone here, a dancer, a waitress, whoever you like. But so that I know about it, and my daughter doesn't know a thing. You and Katya must live a long happy life together, die on the same day, as it should be. Here's to you and Katya. This is good shit. Alexander Osipovich. But I... I had no intention. You will. Gioconda! There, marked me straight away. I'm like Milady now. - Lisa, what are you going to have, wine? - Yes, please. Vladislav, sort out wine for Lisa. - So it's Vladislav. - Vladislav. He's my son-in-law. A handsome lad. I love him myself. - Vladislav! - What? - To women! - Yes, Alexander Osipovich. Lisa, the way we're sitting, if I get up you'Il fall down. To you!! What do you want? I want love. He's a little nervous. Kiss him. Don't be shy. You're one of us now, we've both got one on our right, understood? So, Lisa wants a car. And you, Vladislav, will give her that car. I'll give you the money. But our agreement... Do you remember our agreement, Vladislav? Lisa, go to Alexander Osipovich. He misses you already. Yes? You called me? No, no, it's nothing. Wait. Try to act like everybody else. Like everybody - is that like you? Well, aren't you a sight for sore eyes! Are you here on your own? No female admirers? There aren't any real men around anymore. How come some madam hasn't snatched you up? All they can think about is getting a ring on that finger as fast as they can. And here we've got you all to ourselves. You're flattering me. I liked you right away, Igor Vladislavovich. You are a man with taste, What's it to you, Irina Anatolyevna? You should look to the graveyard not the Registry Office. What was the chemistry homework? - You with a trainer now or by yourself? - By myself. Why do I need a trainer? - I know more than them anyway. - True that. - Got cigarettes? - No. Fuck, need to get some beer in, lads. Roasting like it's July! So, shall we go fetch some then? What, you want a cig? A cig? It's kind of dead here. Shut the fuck up, Gleb might hear. Come on man! You going to see Face? The fuck do I want to do that for? You a geek or what? Hi! Careful there! Careful, careful, man. Come on man why you fucking bitching? F-f-f-fucking wanker. Your first time, is it? Give me a couple. Oi, Jerry! Oi! Listen up! Go fetch some tinnies! No way! We got nabbed there last night. You're a little bitch. A little bitch. You transferred to us from 1114? I heard it's a crap school. - Yeah, fucking crap. - Yeah. Yeah? I'm picking up now. What you picking up? Weed, what else, and about the free yards... I told ya, there's a fourth one, where the freebies are. Fuck the freebies, a crowd of losers gonna turn up and what then? - Any blow? - No dough - no blow. Fuck. Oi, didn't Brain say what he was getting? Get some decent stuff, none of that cut shit. - OK. - And some drone with the change. Uhhh, where you headed, gents? Where we running to, lads? Stop, fucker! Gentlemen! Wait, let's talk! You know how to fucking run, alright! You're like motherfucking athletes, lads! Hold up for fuck's sake! Pretty please! Got cash on you? And what if I find it? For fuck's sake! Where's that nice little phone? Take that, bitch! Fucking here, you fucking piece of shit! Fucking moron! Where's that nice little wallet? Bitch! Oi you! You hear me? What's that you filmed there, fucker? Give me your phone. - Give me your phone! - Fucking piece of shit! Fucking Judas. - What's the password? - It's the number Pi. Number Pi! Fucking number poof. 314. And then? 159. 159. That's it. I always forget. Stop, fucker! For God's sake, fuck! Lads. Here, fuck! There, look at him running. Fuck, bro, my bad. Fuck, listen, I wasn't too hard on you? - No. - You alive? That's what I wanted... For it to go on your social media... Thank you, thank you. Listen, you'll come to the pad with me tomorrow and do a video for me, an exclusive one. - OK. - OK? - Sure you're OK? - I'm sure. Nice one. OK. So, let's go? Let's go. - Fucking leave this scum. - Got fucking banged. Enough, leave him. Yes, at the parade. I got it. Have you been dancing here long? A year already. Or more? A year. I wish I'd come here before! She's our little prude. Unlike you! This is for you. Her tailor isn't that great. Permit me to spirit you away. The girl is taken. Vladislav! Come here. Come back to the table, Vladislav. Come back to the table. Come here now. Let it go, understood? Me too. Breathe out. What you sitting there for? Can't you see the bird is bored? Get over here. Wow! Hey lad, d'you need a third in there? Lad! Aren't you bored having such conventional fun? Have you even read "The 120 Days of Sodom"? What, you want to feed me shit or spank me? Come here, take off your clothes. Come by, I'll spank you. Oi, you from our school? Fuck off, Brutal! Cut the fucking shit, will you? The fuck's wrong with you? That was my grandma's! Here, here, fuck! Not near me! Drink, drink! One more! You'll see it now! For fuck's sake, not near me. Here, have a drink, bruv. When will you pay me back? Oi! When will you pay me back. I'm asking you. What was that painting called with the flower in someone's arse? Listen! When will you pay me back? When will you pay me back? A lot can be said of a person by how they treat their word. What can be said of you, of how you perform your duties? The ones that you yourself have taken on? The ones that buy you your damn impunity? I did as I was told, Daddy. If you go on like this, you're going back to the same cell I sprang you from. And stop calling me Daddy. It ages one so. Nearly there. Let's shoot some video, too. Yeah, why not. Pass the ball! Here! What's going on between you and Stella? I'm curious, come on, spill it. Nikita's so annoying! What's he doing here? Yours at six today? - Yeah, OK. - Text me the address. Pass the ball! I wrote this yesterday. Fucking great, isn't it. Ask Dron. Oi, Dron! Pass it. Who's that chick with you? You know what... Looks like Sonya's been coming onto you since the party. - See how she wiggles her arse. - Yeah, looks like it. So, and what? In what sense? What you gonna do? Nothing, I guess. You an idiot or what? D'you fuck around with anything besides your iPhone? Fuck, bruv, just don't hold back this evening. Listen, maybe without the T-shirt? I'm saying, maybe without the T-shirt? I saw it... What? You've got everything OK. I've got everything fucking on point. OK, let's do it. Oh, anything but this! Get the children away! Lift your head up a little. That's good. - Fuck, it's not too gay? - No. Let me try something. So? Finished? Let me see. I'm def gonna need some fucking filters. Here, pretty cool. Fucking top. Send me. Shall I gather people for tonight? Or for tomorrow? Ultraviolence? Listen, wait, where are you running off to? I can't... You can't get it up for me, I get it. It kind of just happened... I'll explain everything! It just happened? Accidentally wanking over a guy? I hurt you. I'm sorry. How can I explain? That you're a fag? Thanks very much, no need, I got that already. Please don't tell anyone, OK? Anyone? What about him? I shouldn't tell him that you wank over him? And what if I do? How would you like that? - Sonya... - Sonya what? Sonya fucking what? You're fucking sick in the head. Careful there. Work the body. The fuck you doing? Come here, baby. Whoa, someone's in a fighting mood. Switch up! Switch up! Today's my day. Come on, fight, you fucker! Why'd you fucking bang him? Fucking ask him. Prick! Where're you going, mate? Fuck! Have you given your chauffeur the day off? I'm sure he's not complaining. You're so harsh with him. Is there any other way? They'll stop being afraid of you. And what then? They'll fear someone else and serve them, not you. We've built communism, lit up the Ilyich lamps and gone into space, but we've failed to change human nature. And have you read any Nabokov? Nabokov? I might have. I'm more into ballet, the classics, don't you know. With Nabokov there's poetry in every line, although everyone says 'scandalous "Lolita", ban it'. But it's about love. And love's always right. And impossible. And do you know that man who took me from you? He's asked me to dance before, too. Is he an acquaintance of yours? Could we drop the formality? You're the closest thing in the world to me and we're still not on a first-name basis. Then stop the car. Over there, in the alley, where the jasmine is flowering. On the curriculum today, it's supposed to be Plato's dialogue "On Justice". But I suggest we talk about "The Symposium". I'm so fucking hungry. "The Symposium" is dedicated to the problem of love. At a banquet, the playwright Agathon proposes that Socrates sits by him, to which Socrates remarks: "How fine it would be if wisdom were a sort of thing that could flow out of the one of us who is fuller into him who is emptier, by our mere contact with each other." Phaedrus says that Eros came before other gods. Only those who are in love will consent to die for others. A lover surpasses his beloved in divinity although he himself thinks otherwise. Pausanias says that there exist two Eroses - the Heavenly and the Common. Heavenly Love is a love for boys. May I leave? - Not now. - No, now. Those who are inspired by Heavenly Love possess a fondness for what has the robuster nature and larger share of mind. I'll just keep you for five minutes. Fuck him, bruv. - Do you need help? - No. - If you need me... - What? You'll go and fight? This is what your corps is about, then? While all of this goes on abroad, you decided... What exactly did you decide, comrade Colonel General? I didn't decide anything. I had no idea that my son-in-law and this girl, I mean... I thought... You clearly put a lot of thought into it. Will they make an example of him? I'm begging you, please don't. Who's going to marry Katya after such a disgrace? All of this is my life... It's a little too late now, Aleksandr Osipovich. You should have kept tabs on your personnel. I did! But what? What now? What? I beg you, speak to those upstairs. The word of a soldier. This will never happen again. The word of a soldier. Here you are. And your wife's. My wife is having hers replaced and forgot her certificate. I hope mine will be sufficient. Of course, quite sufficient. Your room is 314. Thank you. Let's go. Listen, I was just passing... I thought... then... about the boxing... things can be strange, right? I'm not some kind of weirdo. I thought, that time... at the boxing. It turned out funny, right? Fuck! What the fuck?! You out of your fucking mind? You're going to love it here. Look to your right. Who the hell's that? Don't you remember? That's our best friend! Fuck! Untie me, bitch! What do you want? You wouldn't understand. Quiero hacer contigo lo que la primavera hace con los cerezos. Fuck! You're talking fucking rubbish! What the fuck are you doing? Bitch! These cunting pranks! Fuck! Ouch, bitch! You fucking skank! What are you doing there? Me? Nothing. But you just dumped your dear Stella. Look, what do you want? Money? I have twenty grand in my pocket. Take it. I've spent so long thinking how to make everything beautiful and you're making it so common. Why're you fucking with my head? Can you speak normally? Wherein lies me and wherein lies normal? Listen... if you're in love, let me fuck you or whatever and I'll be off. OK then. - I've changed my mind. - Cunt! Did you order room service? My general. My boy. 9 messages from Stella... Heart... Gorgeous... Heart Seleznyeva... Hello, cunt. Why the fuck are you in my boyfriend's profile pic? Well, why the fuck shouldn't I be in my boyfriend's profile pic? Right, darling? She's so affectionate, so lady-like. Where did you take it, to get him to pull something like that, you cunt? Oh, she's unfriended you. So what, you won't even stay friends now? Why have you done this? Done what? Why've you kidnapped me? I got bored. I'm getting bored with you, too. They're not even talking about us on the news. What are they talking about? The bacchanalia in the supermarket. - What's that? - That is when you're happy and drunk. There are no taboos in nature; it's people themselves who make up the laws and this limits their freedom in the paltriest fashion. Immorality - that is the highest law of nature. How much did you say you had on you? No one really needs you, except your dog. What dog? I had a mutt. Half husky, half wolf. Father brought it as a pup from Kamchatka. I called him Durden, like in "Fight Club". I'd take him with me when I went to boxing training and leave him there for an hour, tied up somewhere outside the club. I came out this one time after the session. It was winter, getting dark at five in the evening. I came out and he was lying on the snow with a knife stuck under his ribs and blood on his fangs. If it hadn't been for the chain, he'd have killed whoever attacked him. Look what I found. And also... is she from our school? I need to know for sure. I don't know, I've never seen her before. What about other schools? Is there some database I can check? There's one on the internet. I think. OK, thank you. Wait! You forgot this! I yearn for spring to come I can hear it in the night As it's fluttering like sadness in a cold breeze. I yearn for sleep to come so I can meet you as I soar into the sky on a spring breeze. I yearn for sleep to come so I can meet you as I soar into the sky on a spring breeze. I will sing on and on. The blue and the brass of the sky will drown my lips with wondrous light. I will drink on and on From the ocean of miracles that exists somewhere beyond the end of the world. I will drink on and on From the ocean of miracles that exists somewhere beyond the end of the world. And I'll become the moon so I can hide the night in my arms. Joyful and jubilant, you'll touch me. And I'll become the dawn so we can whirl ourselves away from misfortune and despair. And I'll become the dawn so we can whirl ourselves away from misfortune and despair. I yearn for spring so much! Pay him no attention. Or do. He's pleasant to the touch, in case you're wondering. Can I at least eat all that? Deny yourself nothing, darling! It's venison. Try the Moet. Couldn't have got anything simpler? We can't go outside. Beyond the wall are plague and bonfires. Who will deny, that it's far more fitting to give comfort to gentle ladies rather than to men? Within their bosoms, 'twixt fear and shame, they hide secret fires of love, and how much of strength concealment adds, they know who have proved it. As they live a life of vacant ease, and, yearning and renouncing in the same moment, they meditate diverse matters which cannot all be cheerful. If thereby a melancholy make entrance into their minds, it is like to tarry there, unless it be dispelled by a change of ideas. Key to 314. Nina. Are you Nina? I... You know what I'm thinking? Like I give a fuck. We're all animals. The best thing that can happen to you in life is to be a beautiful animal. We live like immortal gods. And you're one too? One what too? A beautiful animal. Aren't I? You have no business here. You're not wanted here. How come I don't give a shit what you think? Outlaw! Outlaw! He's ringing. A lot can be said of a person by how they treat their word. How do you perform your duties, the ones that you yourself have taken on? The ones that buy you your damn impunity? Who have you dragged to your place after being told not to kidnap or murder in the next two weeks? What were you doing with him for so long after I'd said not more than an hour alone with other men? Come to me right now, the car's waiting and no tricks, is that clear? Yes, Daddy. Here again tomorrow? Grab my phone. Let me give you my trainers or hoodie. No, I'm OK, thanks. Quiero hacer, quiero... quiero hacer. What? Quiero... hacer. This chick here... Ulyana, or whatever her name is, the one you've got this photo with, the one you're sort of seeing. She's not on the school list, she's not on any database. I checked. Her account is fake, she's fake. Here again tomorrow? You're never going to see her again! Nikita, I... And about the boxing... I don't want anything from you, got it? I'm just like you. Like everybody else. I don't want anything at all. Where is she? The tracker and chip stopped working two hours ago. The phone's out of coverage, so is the driver's.
