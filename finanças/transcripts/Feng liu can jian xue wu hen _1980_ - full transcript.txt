(dramatic music) (overlapping voices) - Hey hey. Look I think that guy's a woman. - I don't believe it. - Yeah it's true I tell you. - I'll check it out then. (grunting) - What are you doing down there? You're pretty cheeky huh? - I guess so. - Okay let's see how you like this. (grunting) (dramatic music) - Hey look a really good fight. - [Woman] Alright you two break it up. (grunting) - Sorry sorry. Oh sorry so sorry. Oh here's my bush whacker look, see. (suspenseful music) - You're dressed like a man but I still found you. You know I utter a word you won't get in to the city. - You won't. - You know I will. Hey. (contemplative music) - Fuck you. - Only with me can you enter Piqua city safely. - You're next, what's your name? - No need to ask, she's my fiance. - Yeah right, what's you're name? - Wong Chun. - Here that, you're see she's certainly a woman isn't she? - Hey you bastard you talk too much. I'll give you a hard time it it keeps up. - Hey now I'm only trying to help out. I told you this guy's a girl. Don't believe it, I hope you don't regret it. You mark my words. - Yeah okay you still got a big mouth. Your background, family education? You may enter. - Okay. - Hey hey hey hey hey, wait a minute. Don't run away so fast. - Hey, what's you're name? - Tian Min Chu. - Occupation? - I'm a plaster salesman okay. Can I enter or not? - Where's your knife? - Knife? Oh I almost forgot. (dramatic music) - You call this thing a knife? - What do you mean? No one said it had to be a certain size or made of metal. It's a perfectly good blade. - [Official] Oh okay you're in. - Let's go. - [Official] Next. - I'm One Eyed Eagle. Hey what do you think of this blade? (laughing) (dramatic music) (grunting) - [Man] What's going on? - [Man] It's One Eyed Eagle. It's One Eyed Eagle. (somber music) Who did it? (somber music) - Please submit this to your master. - Wait right here. - Master says you may enter. This way. (dramatic music) - [Tian] Master. - [Red Guard] Kneel. Anyone who approaches our Master must first kneel down and give obedience, now kneel. - I only kneel down for God in Heaven. I won't kneel for just anyone. And that means you too. - How dare you? You must kneel down. Get him. (dramatic music) - Is this what you call courtesy? Is that who would treat a distinguished guest? - Stand back. (dramatic music) (punches landing) (grunting) - Stop. Stop for the sake of your own courage. I exempt you from kneeling down. - Thank you. My name is Tian Min Chu. - Tian Min Chu? How did you get that talisman? - 10 years ago an elder who called himself The Man of Sorrow gave it to me. - [Master] That's you're own business. But why do you come here? - I... Well it is my intent to come here to try and find that same elder. And I'm here to attend the knife skill contest. But I would ask you if you would agree to cancel this contest immediately. - For what reason? - The real intentions of many who have come here, if I may say so, are not as simple as just competition. Not all the people who are here to attend the meeting are honest and so I do believe that this Piqua City, the paradise will soon become a slaughterhouse. - Well this knife skill contest is failed completely. My original purpose was to get a man, one with whom I'd had a feud for many years. I've been trying to find him but I've failed. He has a weakness for knives. And so I organized this contest for the sole intention of attracting him but I failed. He hasn't come. - Oh is that so? Then. - Alright let me tell you the facts. The one whom you seek is one of my top 10 men. He'd returned to his home a year ago because of old age. - Oh you mean that he is not in Piqua City now? - That's correct. - Then can you tell me where is he now? - I know where he is. - Then can you tell me what his address is then? - Yes but on one condition. - And what is that? - Although you have the royal talisman I'm not obliged to tell you. Therefore you must do something for me in exchange. - Alright what is it you want me to do? - Well I want you to find a person for me. - You mean your foe? - You're very smart. - You assigned many men to try but you failed. To ask me to try on my own is absolute nonsense. - Warriors take him. (punches landing) (grunting) (dramatic music) - Stand back. Young man you think you're pretty good do you? Alright see if you can defeat me. - You're on. (punches landing) (grunting) (dramatic music) Alright then you win. Okay I'll go look for your foe. But first you must tell me his name. - He's changed his name many times. He's an old man and his face is full of scars. He's also blind, deaf, and crippled. - A man like that, how can he be dangerous? - You can't judge a book by it's cover. - I'm not sure about that. Let chance decide. Goodbye. Oh an as for the knife contest-- - It's alright. The power and fame of Piqua City are a match for any threat. I won't renegade on my promise. The winner, the First Knife, is already in my mind. And once the First Knife is selected the contest is then over. They'll be no worries from then on. - Good luck and congratulations, goodbye. - Wait. What about your weapon? - I never take a weapon. The jade knife is only used for protection. - You mean to say it's never touched any blood? Is that true? - That's right. - Good it's a good knife. The number one knife in the world. Come on. (dramatic music) - You? (dramatic music) - [Girls] Good fortune Master Tian. - A thousand tares of gold for a page of knife skills. It's just one page, it's extensive and profound. (dramatic music) - And if I refuse to take it what will you do then? - Well I hope you will not refuse it. Because if you do I will have to burn it in public to avoid it falling into evil hands. It would be a disaster and also my sin. My people would never forgive me. Please take it. - So I have to accept it? (dramatic music) - Good my will is done. Show him out. Follow me. Declare we have chosen the man on the first night and the reward has been presented. - [Red Guard] Yes sir. (dramatic music) - You're pretty good. - But we're complete strangers. - That's right however I have heard about you. You've been chosen as First Knife and you've got the knife skills page don't you? - So you're here for that. I'd like to know what you're name is then. - Lonqun Hai Tia. - Oh that's a very famous name. From a bandit family then? - Shut up. Now I'm gonna get that knife from you. Get him. (punches landing) (grunting) (swords clanging) (grunting) - My name is Tian Chou I'd like to thank you fair ladies. - You are most welcome. - May I know your names? (contemplative music) - My mistresses name is Chou. - Thank you for saving my life. After I complete my business I will return to find you. - Find me? But why? Do you perhaps want to teach me some of your knife skills? - Lady. I bid you goodbye. (dramatic music) - [Tian] Well lady, you're effort to get the knife skills will be in vane. - I don't understand what you mean. - You don't? His name is Tian Chou isn't it? - Do you know him? - Yes I do. And not only that but our relationship is very special. - What do you mean special relationship? Say it straight out, don't beat around the bush. - He's my younger sisters fiance. You mean that he didn't tell you that he's already engaged? - We met by accident. Do you think we could discuss these matters at further length? (contemplative music) What do you think? There's something very odd about that one. Or maybe you didn't notice it? I'm sure that that man is really a girl. - What? Do you really think so? (contemplative music) (laughing) - [Man] Hey where is he? - I'm up here. - [Man] Come down. - [Man] Hey come on. - Come on down. - Hey first you gotta call me grandad. Then I'll throw your clothes down one by one. - What? He wants us to call him grandad oh my God. I need my clothes though. - [Man] Okay grandad. - No no not like that. Say it one at a time. - One at a time? (all talking at once) - [Man] We need to get up there and kill him. Let's get him shall we? - [Man] I mean you gotta do it. - What did you say? Speak louder will you? - [All] We want you to give our clothes back. - Come on. - So you're the Elder Si? Elder Si, as a matter of honor you must return their clothes to them, they're naked. - Now way young fellow. They're all evil guys. Don't you see they'll kill me when they get their clothes. They'll kill me right in front of you, you just watch. - [Man] What did he say? - Promise him safety and he'll return the clothes. I promise you. - Once he returns our clothes and weapons we'll forget it alright men? (all talking at once) - Oh you hear that, they won't hurt you. - Okay okay okay. Here you are, here. Some for you. And your weapons. (gasping) (punch lands) - You almost hit me. That wasn't very nice was it now? - That's right and your kung fu is pretty good. (laughing) - Oh look the five flag men are here. Let's clear out of here come on. - Our master has been waiting for you at the Quen Yu Shrine for a long time now. (dramatic music) - What kind of invitation is that? - Looks like we'd better go. - This way. (dramatic music) - Sir. - I've heard a lot about you. (laughing) - You flatter me sir. This is Elder Si. - Oh the famous magic Si Si. Then we're all one happy family here aren't we? (laughing) - What an asshole. - What? What did he say? - Nothing at all, nothing. (laughing) - Sit down gentlemen. (suspenseful music) (upbeat music) (laughing) Bring it here. (contemplative music) As my gesture of respect please accept this gift. - There's no reason for me to accept it. But tell me your reason for inviting me here. That's what I really want to know. - I hope to transact some business with you. I want to make an exchange to acquire your knife skills with both you. - My knife skills? I can't accept that. Goodbye sir. - Take him. - Sorry but I gotta get the ever loving heck out of here. (dramatic music) (punches landing) (grunting) (dramatic music) - Hey Tien, take it. (punches landing) (grunting) What am I gonna do when it rains now? (punches landing) (grunting) (dramatic music) (groaning in pain) - You? - You stand back let me handle these ruffians. (groaning in pain) - Tu Lu Wein. Spare my life. - You don't have enough power to try to frighten others. You should be ashamed. - [Tian] There's no hatred between us. - You're like a woman. You're bound to lose because your sissified character. - Funny thing you answer kindness with scorn. (dramatic music) Hey hey hey what are you standing there for? Follow her, follow her. (contemplative music) Hey what are you doing? What are you looking for? You haven't said anything about food at all and I'm extremely hungry. Come on. Why don't we take a rest in the temple for a while? Say something. - [Tian] Alright. - Hey. Hey why don't you say anything? You want me to go out and get us something to eat then tell me if you do. (crickets chirping) - Elder. - Hey talk to me once I get back alright. (suspenseful music) - I've been waiting for you. (metal clangs) (contemplative music) - Give me the knife skills. (swords clanging) (grunting) - Hey stop fighting, stop fighting. Oh stop it stop. Oh stop stop, stop fighting. Hey hey stop please. Stop it, oh God. (groaning in pain) Stop, will you stop, ow. Stop. - Why are you doing this to me? - It is said you're the finest knife in the world. And you've got rewards for it too. - No I was given it in Piqua City. A page of Suen Yuen Knife Skills. I accepted no other reward. - [Mae] Enough talk. (swords clanging) (grunting) - What you again? - Yes, by the way my name is Tian Wu Hein. - [Elder] Stop it, stop fighting. - [Mae] Wu Hein? - That's right and you? - Mae Hin Tian. - What an ugly name. (crickets chirping) - Thank you Tian Wu Hein. - Year old think this guy's a girl? (groaning in pain) - You should be careful. Many will be after you you know. And you should handle them with great care. (groaning in pain) - Is that? (groaning in pain) - Elder. - Why did you kick me? Tell me why you-- - Elder where did you get this sword? - Okay I'll tell you. I found that sword lying outside a cave somewhere near Chipi. - Chipi? Tell me which Chipi? - Chipi in Chi Yu County, Hubay Province. (contemplative music) Right under the middle slope of this mountain. - How do we get down? (contemplative music) - I can do it. (contemplative music) Here's some rope. You take it but be careful now. (contemplative music) (wind blowing) Hey watch out. (wind blowing) I'll wait for you up here. - Don't worry about me Elder. (punches landing) (grunting) (contemplative music) - [Chi] Where did you get that sword? - Uncle Chi don't you know me? I'm Tian Min Chu. - Chou Chu, it's you? - Uncle Chi why are you here? - Chou Chu it's an unexpected surprise to see you here. How's your father? - My father's dead. He's been dead a long time. - What? - 10 years ago on the night of July the 15th, right near here, near this cave. He was set upon. He was killed and then he fell into a river. (somber music) His body is gone. - You say your father was set upon and he was killed, then fell into the river near this cave? - Yes. - But I know nothing of this. - Uncle, what did you say? - Chou Chu. There was this deep secret held between your father and myself but now I feel that it is quite strange. Tell me did you know about this first hand? - No I didn't. An Elder told me afterwards. - Did you know the elder or at least his name? - No I don't. He just said he was called Man of Sorrow. - [Chi] And what else did he tell you? - He gave me a talisman from Piqua City. He said I should meat him at the city 10 years later. But when I went to see him... He'd left Piqua City. - On the night of July 14th, 10 years ago your father did come to see me at midnight. - Brother you know I'm not afraid. But I just don't want to be misled and participate in the crippled party because of the present situation. I don't mind dying but think of my poor son. He'll grow up an orphan. - Get up my brother let's talk it over you are-- - No brother you must promise to grant my request or else I-- - We are close brothers. Your business is my business. - I don't care if I am to die. But I hope you will raise my son and see that he is cared for. From the depths of hell I will thank you for this favor you have done for me brother please. - Brother listen his mother died when he was young. How can he suffer the pain of losing his father now? - What are you saying to me? (somber music) (groaning in pain) - Brother. - Let me... (groaning in pain) Let me go to Chipi dead instead of you. (swords clanging) (grunting) - I can't believe that my father would let you die for him. No, but anyway I cannot let you stay here any longer. - My child you're being very opulent. - Come Uncle before dawn let's go. (fire roaring) - Child take care of yourself. (punch lands) (dramatic music) (grunting) - Uncle Chi, Uncle Chi. How could you do this to yourself? Uncle Chi. (somber music) What you again? - I've been waiting a long time for you here. Why didn't you come up? - Why are you following me? - Well at least you could say I am consistent. I always go for what I want. I'll throw a rope down to you. You tie the knife skills onto it or I'll cut that rope. Better make up your mind quickly. (somber music) - Tian Chou, take it. (dramatic music) (wind blowing) - Thank you. You have now saved me thrice. Tell me did you come up here on your own? - What do you think? Of course I came alone. - Well have you seen Elder Si then? - You only think of others. Do you really not see that I like you so much? - What did you say? (contemplative music) - Merciful Buddha. - Merciful Buddha. - I believe this is your first time here at the temple. - Yes. My father spoke many times about you. And I respect you because of him. - And who is your father? - Tu Lin Chiou. - Tu Lin Chiou? You're the son of Chivalry Chu. - Yes that is correct. Tell me do you know where my father is right now? We haven't seem him for awhile. - Oh he hasn't been here for 10 years now. - My father left home in the middle of the night July the 15th 10 years ago. And he never returned. And to this day he's still missing. We don't know where he is. - Merciful Buddha. May he bless your father. - Tell me Abbot can you remember the last time my father was here? - The last time he was here was on the seventh of July. He brought a picture to keep here. - What picture? Tell me what picture? - It was a picture of a lady. It was she who presented to your father I remember. - Where is it now? May I take a look at this picture that you're talking about? - Your father asked someone to take it away. - When was that? - I think it was the fifth of August the same year. - Did that person tell you the reason why my father didn't come himself? - He only said that he was asked by your father to get it. And I didn't ask him any more about it. Oh and I think that his family name is Yu. His nickname is Ping Ming Xo Lung. And he's well known in Yung Chou. You'll find him there. - Thank you Abbot. I will ask you to keep my visit a secret if you will. - Don't worry I will do that. - Thank you and farewell dear Abbot. - Buddha bless you. (suspenseful music) - Waiter! - Come on have some more. (overlapping voices) - Come on let's go. - Thank you, come again. - Thank you, see you. - Thanks for the drink. - Bye bye. - Tell me honestly sir. Where is Ping Ming Xo Lung of Wu Kai? - Well I... (groaning in pain) - Where is he? - Okay okay I'll tell you go East. Once you leave the North gate you'll come across him not far away but watch it he's not easy to deal with I tell you that. There a bunch of tough characters. (dramatic music) - [Hou] Welcome my friend please come in. - I am Tian Chou I greet you well. (suspenseful music) (desk falling) (grunting) (laughing) (swords clanging) (grunting) (suspenseful music) (laughing) - [Hou] Tian Chou give me the knife skills immediately. - May I know your name sir? - Hou Tou Kwai. - Oh Hou Tou Kwai? You're the second of the eight odd persons. That is good. I may give the knife skills but first I want to know someone. - Who is it? - Well his nickname is Ping Ming Xo Lung. - The eighth master. - Don't worry. I'm not here to fight a duel. I only want to ask him something. - I'm Yung Yu Kwai. - So you're here too. Well that saves me some trouble. I want to ask you one thing. 10 years ago on August the 15th I understand you went to Quen Yu Temple to get a ladies picture. - You're mistaken. I never went to Quen Yu Temple. That is your question. Hand over your knife skills right now. (swords clanging) (grunting) (eerie music) - Why won't you answer me? I want to know did you go to the temple? (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) (blades spinning) (groaning in pain) (crickets chirping) (grunting) Did you go to the temple or not? - Yes I did go to the temple. But I was asked to go. I was told to go. - Do you know the magic scholar Tu Lin Chiou? - [Yung] It was 10 years ago. The magic scholar came to me suddenly. He gave me 100 pearls and asked me to go to Quen Yu temple to get a drawing for Chivalry Chu. That's all I know. - What did he look like? - [Yung] His face was covered I couldn't see clearly. - Do you have any idea who it might have been? - Yes. He was generous. There's only one man in Yung Chou. - Do you mean it was Mae Lin Yien? Let me ask you again. Do you know who the lady in the picture was? - I really don't know. Please spare my life. - [Tian] Go on, be off with you. (contemplative music) (crickets chirping) (dramatic music) (crickets chirping) - You're clumsy. You almost broke my leg. - I'm surprised to see you. Why are you here? - Why am I here? It's all for you. - What? All for me? - That's right. - Follow you the whole day. To Quen Yu Temple, then into Yung Chou. - Oh then you know everything. - You're Chivalry Chu's son. It isn't a secret at all. - I know you're kind hearted. Only my father is still unknown that's all. I'm in no mood for anything else. - I don't blame you. After all I'm curious about this too. - But this matter is more complicated than you can imagine. It won't become clear soon. - Oh have you found any strong clues yet? - I haven't had the time. - I found something very interesting. Follow me. (contemplative music) (crickets chirping) The half candle was here when I came. See it there? Look. Was it left 10 years ago? (contemplative music) (crickets chirping) Come over here. Look over there. - [Tian] Red left hand. Yellow rat and wine. The garden is full of the scene of spring. - And what else do you see? - These words were scraped off by someone. - And can you see what those words are? - It looks like Chou Tou Feng-- - Yes. These words were scraped off very recently. What's that? What are you thinking? - I think you know that I'm not Tian Chou. I'm Chu Yung Chu. - To me it isn't important what your name is. - Thank you. One thing I can't figure out is who is the lady who gave the picture to my father? And why did Mae Lin Yien take the picture back? - Who do you think it was that composed the poem on the wall? Can you tell me? - [Tian] Well if it was composed by Mae Lin Yien himself that would figure. But if he did write it why would he scrape it off? - Right. It's a haunted house. Ordinary people wouldn't come here. Probably it's the murderer who came back here. That's it. - [Tian] What's it? - I just had a thought. But that's very peculiar, and besides... No. No it's impossible, it's impossible. - What are you thinking? Just say it. - It's only a guess. I hope you won't get angry. You think it's a stupid idea. - Okay. - Let's just say if a husband discovered that his wife was in love with another man in order to save his good name and face you see he would do just about anything. - Oh I see. You mean the lady who presented the picture is Mae Lin Yien's wife. - I'm only guessing. (dramatic music) - Who's that? (dramatic music) - What you again? - I was told he was here in Yung Chou. So I followed him. It is said that Mae mansion is very large. That it is. So I came to take a look. - [Tian] We're here to see it too. Do you know who lives in Mae mansion? - No I don't. - [Tian] Then I'll tell you. It's Mae Lin Yien's home. I'm sure you know it well. Everybody here was killed in a sudden accident about 10 years ago. They were even sadder than you. At least you and your wet nurse escaped. So where is your courage now that you showed at Piqua City? Tell me where is that courage? Show it again if you can. - What do you mean? - Standing in your own home facing everything familiar to you. Why don't you admit you're from the Mae clan? (laughing) - Yes I am that. But you are wrong. I'm not one of this family. (laughing) - I know for taking revenge. But you don't want to admit it. - Tian Chou your imagination is really profound. (laughing) This isn't the only family with the name of Mae you know. (laughing) - So it's just a coincidence that you're name is the same? - Oh stop it will you. I'll tell you for the last time. I'm not a member of this Mae family, goodbye. - Mae Hin Tian, if you are a member of this Mae family it would not only be helpful to him but it would also help you to get your foe. - A nice try but it's not enough. I really am not a member of this Mae family. - I wonder. Who knows he may be telling the truth. - Well I'm not convinced. I think he's lying. (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) - [Both] Princess. - Alright you two why do you come to see me at this time? Double Phoenix Order. - It's the Masters orders that you should return at once. - This must be some kind of a joke. - I'm sorry but you're out there alone. If you face any danger-- - [Princess] Enough. Don't speak any further. - Please return soon. (contemplative music) - [Servant] Princess let us go now. - [Servant] Yes let us go. (somber music) (crickets chirping) - She's quite a woman. (dramatic music) (calm music) - Princess let us continue quickly. - Oh we're all tired. Let's all take a rest here for awhile. - Bet well... - Can't I? - Sure you can. (calm music) (eerie music) - Hey excuse me someone's chasing me. I'm gonna hide inside there so don't expose me and I'll thank you later on alright. (dramatic music) - Sir did you see someone just go by here? - He's hiding in there. - He betrayed me, the nerve of that guy. (grunting) - I'm sorry but he belongs to me now. - Oh that's I'm finished. (swords clanging) (grunting) - So that's how it is. We shall meet again. - Thank you so much for your help. I'll never forget this favor so goodbye and thank you again. Goodbye, goodbye. - Hey wait a minute old man. Have you ever seen a crippled old man around here? - Well as a matter of fact a few minutes ago I did see someone like that. - Where did you see him? - Down there in that well. Hey wait I'm only kidding I didn't really. Wait a sec just listen to me. I'll tell you what's been happening. Now 10 years ago the massacre of the Mae family happened. It was a mystery to everybody. There was neither any warning nor any evidence before or after the massacre happened. But you see I am one of the worlds best detectives. So I went there to try and find out the truth. One night I snuck into the Mae's backyard. (contemplative music) Hey wait don't leave. (contemplative music) Wait a minute. (suspenseful music) Wait. (suspenseful music) Hey. - Oh sir, sir spare my life. That man he let me come here. (dramatic music) It was right here. - I'll go down and take a look. - You'd better not do that. His kung fu is very good. And once you go down there I can't fight him off if he comes up. So you wait up here and I'll go down. (air blasting) (groaning in pain) (suspenseful music) - Hold it. We have no evil intentions. I only want to ask you if you are Mae Lin Yien Master of this place. We have no evil intent. At Piqua City we... (punches landing) (grunting) - Well then did you see him? - But he ran away. - Tell me what are you looking for? Are a member of the Mae family? - No I'm not. Actually my name's Chu Yung Chu. - Do you mean to say you're a descendant of the magic scholar? - Yes. - That's very strange. Why did you change your name? Don't you want to take revenge for your father? - No, my father was too wild and cruel at that time. He even killed those who didn't deserve to die. Even if they did kill him I still don't want to take revenge. - I do respect your respect for latitude. Will you grant me one small favor? - A favor? Well that depends on what it is. - May I have a look at the knife skills page that was presented to you by the master of Piqua City? That is if you don't mind sir. Oh. So you really trust me? - Why shouldn't I? You risked your life for me. (dramatic music) - Have you practiced according to the instructions? - No I just looked at the pictures. - It's about you tried it don't you think? It looks like the left hand skills of crippled party. - Are you sure? (sword swooshing) - Why don't you try it with your left hand? (sword swooshing) Well that proves it. The left hand skills of the crippled party. - How did the master of Piqua City get his hands on these knife skills then? - It's simple. Probably he's the master of the crippled party himself. - I traveled the world with the purpose of finding the one who drew my father onto the wrong path. And now, well now I haven't lost the chance. Why did the master of Piqua City give me the knife skills then? Did he know that I'm the son of the magic scholar? - You know I do believe it was his ambition to exterminate all the top kung fu men. So he held a knife for the latest knife contest and he selected you as the top knife. And he gave you the left hand knife arts and so you became the target of all these kung fu men you see. And to protect the knife skills you had to kill them. So once the knife skills are stolen then he who practiced the left hand skills couldn't help but kill them then. (sword clangs on ground) So the master of Piqua got what he wanted? - Yes you're right, very right indeed. You're very clever sir. - What a cool guy he is. Well I'm going back to Piqua City to teach him a lesson. (dramatic music) - [Old Man] Good luck. - You won't die of hunger. The sword is behind me. - Don't worry. I won't attack you from behind. I'd like to see your painful expression. - You are a brutal woman. - In order to cope with a beast such as you I have to be. - To love you is no sin indeed. - What was that you said? - I don't care what I have to do to get you. - Why did you bring me here? - To take you to Piqua City. - What? - Talk, tell me where is Tian Chou. - He went to Piqua City that's where he went. - Good. So now it is you who wants to die. So don't blame me. - Hey wait why do you break your promise? What kind of men are you? (flute music) Lady, good lady save me. Lady please save me I ask you. - Tell me why do you want to kill an old man? - They asked me to tell them the truth. So I told them the truth and now they still want to kill me. - He's a liar. How can we trust you? - Be quiet. I'm Mae Hin Tian. May I know your name lady? - [Chu] My mistresses name is Chou. - She's the one who saved Tian Chou. - Mr. Lonqun you don't give up. - Well I... - Whatever happened here if the old man has offended you it's only for my sake, please let him go. And if you should meet him alone another time without my presence teach him whatever you like, alright? - I cannot but follow your request dear lady. He's free to go now. Well go. - [Chu] What are you waiting for? - Let's all go. - What are you doing? What don't you remember? We all agreed. I help you to get the old guy and you help me find Tian Chou. But when we meet a lady you forget everything. It's ridiculous. - Aren't you the same? When you saw her you dared not utter a word. - Right. - So then old fellow you're the Jack of all trades. I want to ask you one thing. - Well then lady please don't call me Jack of all trades. I don't know much at all about anything. - Perhaps but maybe you do know where Tian Chou is now. - You mean you and he? - We're friends. He is out looking for someone that's all. As he is carrying the knife skills with him I was just concerned that he may face trouble so-- - Oh yes he's facing trouble alright. He went to Piqua City. - Really? - Yes that's right. And believe it or not it's up to you. I just told them the same thing and they didn't believe it and so they wanted to kill me. - Oh thank you old fellow. Chu Chi let's go now. (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) - [Tu] Oh look at you. You're so cruel. You even injure your own classmate. - I see you failed your wish very soon. - What do you mean? - I have just killed five crippled party men. They won't forgive me now. I cannot rest. - You're not a member of their group. But your hand. - In order to find those who killed my family I cut off my right arm here so I could join them. - The you are of the Mae family. - One night 10 years ago all my family members were killed by them. I'm the only descendant of the Mae's left in the world right now. - Are you the son of Mae Lin Yien? Tell me did your father know a woman named Tian Hein? - Yes he knew her. That woman's my mother. Why do you ask me that? - I won't say anymore but someone keeps a picture that she drew herself. - Are you insulting my mother? I must kill you. (somber music) - Go ahead. Go ahead. - Here is an antidote it will help you to recover. - If I recover I'll kill you. Aren't you afraid of that? - Well if you don't kill me members of the crippled party will kill me later as I have said to you. If I can't win your heart I prefer that you do kill me now. (contemplative music) Do it go on, kill me, go on do it. - He really wants to sacrifice himself for the love of me? But don't you want to take revenge for your family? - They're all dead now they can't feel any pain whatsoever but if I am killed by your hand I would be a very happy man. - Don't say more. (suspenseful music) On the wall of your dead and deserted house I found a poem written there that proves that they're not all dead. Why didn't you return to take a look? Maybe you're father's still alive. (contemplative music) - He could be. - Hin Tian. Here's your sword. - Thank you. - I must return immediately and report to Master. (dramatic music) (laughing) - [Master] Tian Chou did you find the man you were looking for? - [Tian] If not how could I come back and return and face the master? - [Master] Where is he then? - Well I'd like to ask you first. Is this Suen Yuen Knife Skills or left hand skills of the crippled party? - Who told you that? - No matter who told me I found out anyway. I'll ask you again. Are you the master of the crippled party? - [Master] You answer your question first. The person I asked you to find is he dead or alive? - He's alive. Why didn't you kill him? - Because I have doubts about you. Until I make everything quite clear I don't want to kill him. - I see. So where is he now? - You haven't answered my question yet. I am the master of the crippled party. And now you may tell me just where he is. - Sorry until I make everything clear I won't tell you that, that is secret. - I can manage alone. Take him. (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) How dare you betray me? You're all finished now. - Miss Chou so you're here as well are you? - Don't ask me that now. This is all just one big plot. - Get her. (swords clanging) (grunting) Jail here now. - Yes sir. (swords clanging) (grunting) - [Tian] The spring thunder at midnight awakened me. The traces of tears are still wet. Where can I assign my soul hoping to be pitied by you? Hein Yen. Hein Yen? (coughing) You, are you Chivalry Chu? - You know me? - Dad. Don't you know me? I'm your son. - Chou Chu? - Dad take a look at me carefully. - Chou Chu. - Dad I searched, I looked everywhere for you. - I was cheated by the crippled party. After leaving home that year they got together and jailed me. I thought I would never see you again. Chou Chu. Chou Chu just tell me one thing. How can you be here? - The master of Piqua City ordered me out so that I could finish his mortal foe. - Did you find him? - Yes I did. - Did you bring him in? - How can I bring in somebody only on the word of another man? That's not fair. - Good. I'm glad you know the difference between right and wrong. Did you tell the master where he is now? - No I didn't. He's at the Mae's deserted house at Yung Chou. Say let's break out and see him together. What do you say? - This place is too well guarded. It would be very difficult to escape. - Let's give it a go though. - No you leave alone. I'm too old for all of this. - Father I'm sticking with you from now on I really am. We'll break out together. What do you say? (swords clanging) (grunting) (bomb exploding) (dramatic music) Dad! (dramatic music) - Father I've been waiting here for three days and three nights. Are you really that cruel to deny me seeing you? Father? Father? (contemplative music) Father it's me Chou Hu. Don't you recognize me? Father it's your son. I'm Chou Hu, father. You're right there is a red mole on the back of my neck. Father take a look at it. Father, Father touch my mole Father. Father, Father, Father I'll prove it to you. Father. (contemplative music) Father. I am your son. Why won't you accept me? Who won't you Father? Tell me. Who did this to you? How'd you become this way? Father who did it tell me, I'll take revenge. (dramatic music) (bombs exploding) Father. Father. Father. (groaning in pain) Father! (somber music) Father, Father. Dad. Father. (suspenseful music) - Lian. Lian. Why oh why did I have to come so late? - Mistress. - Hin Tian this lady is your blood mother. - What did you say? - Isn't your nickname Chou Hu? There's a red mole on the back of your neck isn't there? - Yes. - Chou Hu! - Mother! Mother. - Chou Hu. Chou Hu my poor child. (sobbing) - See Mother there lies Father. (sobbing) Look, look. (swords clanging) (grunting) - Miss Chou. Miss Chou. (metal clangs) (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) (water splashes) (swords clanging) (grunting) - [Tian] How do you know my family name? - I told him that. - I came here to tell you I've located my foe. - Who is it? - You. You were the one who killed my father. (swords clanging) (grunting) - No wait. Let's see what happens. - It's reasonable for you to take your revenge. But I have a suggestion. - What is it? - The master of Piqua City is the boss of the cripple party. He is the one we want. - So what are you getting at? - Let's work together and kill them before settling our own dispute. - Yes. Tian Chou is right. We must maintain the lives of the kung fu men. - Alright we'll fight our duel after we exterminate them. - That's a deal. (dramatic music) (swords clanging) (grunting) - [Hein] This is bad, very bad. - Oh no they're just playing around. - We're very late. (swords clanging) (grunting) If this is the famous top 10 kung fu men why are they all here I want to know just tell me. (swords clanging) (grunting) - Now let's see you're a well known famous man you see. If you can somehow manage to steal all their weapons then I'll respect you in a great way. - Why you. - Now that's precisely the reason I asked you three to come here did you realize? - [Elder] You're a famous seer Elder Moe. Can you make all these kung fu men quit and lie down their weapons? - Now matter what anybody does today we should be sure of one thing. I daresay their vital points are closed. They have enormous disorder. - It's really isn't anything, anyone can see that. There's no need to bet. - Now listen to me you don't dare bet with me. If the kung fu men's vital points are closed no one here is able to open them again. - Nonsense I'd dare to bet with you. I can open their vital points easily. - Oh I don't believe it no. - What are you doing? - What is it? - Let me tell you a fortune now. Stand back now, I'll show you. (high pitch zapping) - Elder Cho. (high pitched zapping) How is this possible? You are here too. - You've all been cheated. (swords clanging) (grunting) (high pitched zappings) You see they've all been opened. (grunting) - [All] Thank you Elder Cho. - Now that you're all awakened you should know one simple fact. (laughing) - But it's too late for you to know. If you can help me defeat them. The kung fu men world will belong to you. Otherwise no one can escape from Piqua City. - [Lonqun] If you give us the Suen Yuen Knife Skills we swear we will be loyal to the master. - So you tell us but you still adhere to the wrong beliefs. You may be cheated by him again. - Once we get the Suen Yuen Knife Arts we can lead the kung fu men can't we? (laughing) - Tian Min Chu, Mae Hin Tian you waste your intelligence. (laughing) (blade whirs) (grunting) - Mistress. - I'll beat her to death if you take one more step forward. - Who are you? - Who am I? Can't you guess who I am? Alright make it clear before going to hell. (laughing) - Tu Lin Chiou. - Dad. - My God it's you. (dramatic music) - You never expected it did you? That I could be still alive. (laughing) - Tu Lin Chiou. You ruined my faith and pushed me down the mountian. You're cruel, so cruel. - Me cruel? (laughing) For an unloyal wife such punishment is not too cruel for you. You married me with Mae's baby in your belly. Your heart never belonged to me. Everything is all your fault your responsible. It's you who are cruel not me. - It was you who killed Lian Yen isn't it so? - That's right. It was I who ordered them to murder the Mae family. It's me who allowed you to join the crippled party. - But why? Why did you do that? - Because I want revenge. - You had his wife it's even. - No, it can never become even. Yes I had you. But because you couldn't enjoy the difference, but in fact you couldn't really love me at all. Mae Lian Yen, may he rot in hell. I wanted him to become deaf and blind and disfigured. - Say no more. - I must take revenge upon you for the sake of my father. - Who would have expected that Mae would have two good sons? I wanted to let the two of you go ahead and kill each other so Mae Lian Yen wouldn't shut his eyes in hell. But you two are too clever. But I won't let you two leave here alive. Your dead. - Dad. Dad what are you doing? How can you do this? - Mom what's going on here? Come on tell me tell me. - Dad. - [Tu] Don't call me Dad. Mae Lian Yen's your father. Yes, ask your mother. (dramatic music) - Ma. - It's not true. (laughing) - Tu Lin Chiou you're an animal. - Mother! (dramatic music) Mother, Mother! - Chou Chu, son. (contemplative music) You're brothers but you have different mothers. (contemplative music) It's a long, very long story. Listen please. You must get along, you're brothers. You are... (babbling) - Mother! - Oh no! (dramatic music) - Mother. (dramatic music) - Chou Chu. - [Chou] Mother. - We were secretly engaged when I got pregnant. Your father dare not tell his father that he was a father. So I had to marry Tu Lin Chiou. I didn't have any choice. - Mother. Mother. (somber music) Mother. Mother, Mother. (somber music) No elders. This business is for us two alone. Please don't interfere. - Yes you're right. We won't interfere. - Thank you elders. - Thank you. (swords clanging) (grunting) (dramatic music) (laughing) (swords clanging) (grunting) (bones crunching) (punches landing) (swords clanging) (grunting) - Are you alright? Wake up. Are you alright? (punches landing) (grunting) (dramatic music) (groaning in pain) (dramatic music) (blades spinning) (groaning in pain) (laughing) (blades spinning) (bombs exploding) (maniacal laughter) (groaning in pain) (bombs exploding) (dramatic music)
