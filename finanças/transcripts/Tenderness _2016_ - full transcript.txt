There is a flight in three hours. Tomorrow evening we'll be back. We've got two days to the next rehearsal. Yes, I know. I can’t, my dad is coming. Put it off, In the evening you'll be sitting in a nice Italian cafe, eating real Italian pizza, and drinking local wine. Like in a commercial. I'm trying to cut down on alcohol. So maybe next time. Sorry. See, you wanted to go fishing... ...but fish flew to you. I’ve been transferred to Geneva. I’m leaving the day after tomorrow. My wife will get there two weeks later, Along with all our stuff. I never really thanked you. Account transfers come from Geneva, don't they? You know what I mean. Arsenal. It's season 2005/2006, but ... Wenger signed it. Dude! Look fish. Look what is happening. This is how it goes. Take it. How to control it? Simple. All right. It works. A toast to you. You did it yourself. You know... I know it sounds silly, but meetings with you really helped me. Cheers. It's a pity that we haven't straightened out things with your wife. It's getting better. We talk to each other. Only on the phone, but... We pass each other. I arrive, she leaves. This fish flies or what? Kick it. In the stomach. I can't imagine my life without her. Without a fish? Yes, without a fish. Of course, you could. It`s temporary state. It can last till 180 days after breakup. What kind of theory is this? It`s not a theory, it`s statistics. You talk bullshit sometimes. My friend has a premiere tonight at the theatre, there will be a party later. Come with your wife. I will meet her finally. Sure. We will see. Maybe you need to feed the fish. Come little fish. Drink, drink... Want to hear something? No. I need you to be happy about this. Ok. I lost my job. Hey, that's great. Isn’t it? Cutbacks, apparently... I'm a little sad, I was really trying hard. Maybe not enough? Seriously? Allright honey, I know that you were doing your best. But there's just nothing to worry about. Am I right? Is it? Come on. Cheer up! Cheers! You know… You'll find something else. I will take all the gigs, we'll get by. You won't find any gigs. I'll tell everyone how lame you are. We'll have to move. Sounds good to me. Yea, we can move...

All right, let's not get too sentimental over this. All right? All right. Let's just keep it in mind, for the future. I brought you those mushrooms in tomato sauce that you like. I asked you not to buy these plastic bag. I gave you a linen bag. Yes, sorry, you're right. Take it dear. I made them specially for you. You’re pale and this is healthy. It’s not good for my stomach, dad. How’s work? All right? I’ve read about you in the paper, You're a star. You looked beautiful in that picture. Remember what you told me when you’d returned from your first theater play when you were ten years old? That you’d do anything, even eat two-meal dinners, to have that sclaret curtain. I made one for you, of course... It was hanged up in the living room. You could shift it with a string. You cried when you saw it, I cried with you... ...but you didn’t eat the dinners anyway. I wasn`t good cook, i know it. But you had your curtain. You were happy. One of my plays will have its premiere soon. I can invite you if you want. Nah, this isn’t for me. How about you, How’s it going? Sweetie, what can I tell you, Old age didn’t turn out to be the best of God’s creations. And how are the affairs of the heart? No lucky guy has arrived yet? Stop it, dad. Neither do I have time for this, nor do I feel like it. Don’t listen to my jabbering. I just want you to be happy. I asked for one without alcohol. Martini is not alcohol. Why do you work here? You don't have to. Maybe that's why: beacause I don't have to. Why don't you answer your phone? You know where to find me. We were amused by your book. You read it? Are you kidding? Ok, so tell me sister, what do you need? You know that father is a candidate in the elections. So what? We don’t want you to attract attention to yourself for next six months. Attract attention? By what? Serving beers during happy hours? So why do you show off in TV? No names were mentioned. Ok, listen... ...you decided to abandon your family. Your call. We just don't want you to... …do something that would... ...disturb his campaign. Of course, not for free. After that you’ll get 50.000. Fuck me, you're just like him. So how’s it gonna be? Well...ok. Ok. 100.000. Honey, are you ready? Not yet. How loner do you think? Five minutes. So how do I look? Good enough to eat. And…? Oh, no… Excuse me, is this seat taken? I`m not sure... - Hi! - ...I`m sure. Hey. Have you seen the bar? See, sometimes it's better off without wife. Banquets at theatre are the best. If you don’t open up, Or else i will pretend to be a monkey. Hi. Hi. Special delivery. You know what they say, you can’t have a party without the pomelo. Thanks. So how was it? You know... ...it had its moments. But overall... ...everything was so forced and snobby. Thanks, man. And what the fuck was that pseudo-construction about? Guess who made it? Jeez, is it for real? Horrible. - Fuck, that was awful. - Great, great... I wanted to see if I could handle this challenge. But a lot of people liked it. What’s done is done. Your father called me. He wanted me to join his election committee. My father likes you very much, so you know... I know, but I refused. Knock knock. Happy birthday to you, may good luck go with you... Happy birthday to you, may good luck go with you... Once again, once again... Happy birthday to you... ...happy birthday to you. Thank you! Oh, thank you. Oh my! What are you doing here? God, it’s been ages since I last saw you. What's up? Not much. Everything’s perfect. You look like ... Rayan Gosling. You look awesome. Super-awesome. The best. Thank you. I was thinking about you recently. Oh. You were in my dream. Go on, go on. We were in Thailand, it was exactly the spot where we went together. We were sleeping in a bunga... ...bungalo... Bungalow. In a bungalow. Austrian chancellor was living with us. He was keeping an eye on us all the time, but we just kept looking for the occasion to sneak out and fuck. I really, really like that dream. What’s up? This is Artur, Artur this is Patrick. Cheers. I'll get another one. Where's Julia? She’s not here but we’ll get by. Pawel! Come here. Look what's happening. Julia told me you were together for almost two years. Why didn't it work out? Who told you it didn't work out? I don't know, you split up? Maybe that was the part of the plan. Hey guys, I got alcohol. Wait for me, boys. One more. For Polish theater industry. I'm gonna get another one. Hey! Everyone, everyboy! I would like to thank you! Thank you! You are all fantastic! Cheers! Cheers! You know who was in the audience? People from the Avignon festival. Do you know what that means? Excuse me, I have to make a call. Ok? They get on my nerves too. I just didn’t feel like listening to them anymore. You’re not listening to anything. It’s like you’re not there, ever. Aren't you supposed to go? Aren't you? Julia? Allright… -Paweł? -Yes? -Could you help me, please? -Yes. You know what? I needed to reboot. Run! Run, you fools! I can help you. Oh fuck… Ok, good, very good… It doesn’t work. Wiatrak. I don’t know what it is. Luke, I'm your father.. What do you need that for? I… …am… I had a bet… …with that girl I'm dating, Yes… …that she will…you know… ...wake me up with a blowjob, everyday... …for a week. For a week. A week…yes. And she forgot about it yesterday. And this is her punishment. I will bubble her pussy. Bubble, bubble, bubble, bubble. BubbleBlast. BubbleBlast... …into pussy chlast. Yes… This machine reminds me of my grandmother. She also had little circles on her body. Oh, nice story. Yes, because she was… …in a circle of life. Wait, wait….Ok, now!
