Somebody's got it stolen who could do things like that? Mr. gau some minister of the new government I'm sure you know something about him it's heard that he with his status can accept this secret but I wonder why he did that? He realized he was fooled he thought it was a meeting for seeking peace later he found it's nothing but a trap unlike what he thought so he stole the deal and left nanking he's in Shanghai right now he's a real man he wanted to be in chungching via Hong Kong he would open the secret to the whole world how could the nanking authority let him get away? I got it you want me to protect him leaving Shanghai safe that's it he knows many secrets and the deal is more important the nanking authority won't let him go only you, the rascal of Shanghai the mighty shen gan-fuh, Mr. shen can work out things like that sheau-shen such a person and such a matter I'll do everything I can it doesn't matter how much I'd sacrifice he will leave here safely for sure I am minister Hong from the interior ministry, wei shau-tien please yes, I'm wei shau-tien right now Mr. gau's heading for Shanghai tsau sheau-shen'll reach him with shen gan-fuh Mr. gau's carrying some top secret paper besides he knows a lot of other secrets we have to put him away before he leaves get the paper back go now I'm going to Shanghai immediately Mr. gau The place where the secret deal's stored only me and other two people know if the secret deal is gone and I've left nanking it means the nanking authority assures you're the man taking the paper away yes, so I want you to do me a favor I'm nothing, but the deal is important don't you worry I'll protect you and the deal definitely it'll be arranged okay the day after tomorrow you may go to Hong Kong by ship of a neutral state thanks, Mr. shen you're welcome, we're all for the country there's a man coming upstairs the opposite building It's sheau-Yang, the rifle?

I took the business from wei sheau-tien after I learn the story behind Mr. gau I kind of started to regret and then I saw your brothers on the dock they did everything just to protect Mr. gau they insist to fight even though they know they're not my equals okay. There are only you and me left this is our time since you're standing on our side why do you want to get tough? Thirteen rascals, coach and butcher my name is listed just behind yours everybody says you're the top of the thirteen rascals today we happen to be there.

Your kung fu is better than mine. Mine is just crafty the rule of assassin is you can choose not to kill unless you're killed by the opposite I can do it without regret in this Please!
