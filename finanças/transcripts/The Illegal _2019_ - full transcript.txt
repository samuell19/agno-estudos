What do you say? Say something nice, huh? Break the fourth wall, huh? Look right into the camera. It's okay. Okay. As you know, I'll be leaving for the U.S. in one week. I just wanted to take with me a few words of wisdom from the two people that matter the most to me, you know, for those times when I'm down and I'm ready to give up. Mahi, please tell me your parting words. Now just, you can't get out of this, - so just tell me. - Parting words already. I don't know What? I said I don't know. Okay think, Mahi, I'm leaving five days. Just improvise. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday. Time really flies, no? Wow. So Mahi, my any last words? I mean speak now or forever. Okay, last words. I don't know. Just do your thing, I guess. You can be very stupid and irritating at times, but its okay. Actually, you're a really talented boy. If anybody can make it happen, it's you. You're a fighter. Just believe in yourself. Next. Hello. Have you been to the United States of America before? No sir. Your I-20, please. Sir, your camera cannot stay on the counter. Put your four fingers on your right hand on the scanner, please. Do you intend to go back to your home country when you finish your studies here? - Yes. - How long is the program? Four years. Look into the camera please. 4:45 PM. Hassan grips his camera as he walks through LAX's bleak hallway, a world much different from home. Memories slip through his mind as he remembers the place of his childhood he walked just 24 hours ago, wondering how many days until he would return. If he would return. His virgin eyes sift through the sea of movement. His pursuit of the American dream had led him here. He wonders what makes us chase something so distant? What makes us risk everything and plunge into the unknown? Hassan.

Orientation on Thursday. How are you paying for the tuition? Took a loan. Who will repay it, your father? I'll repay it. Once I get a job. Why would you get into such a great school and choose to study something with no real chance of a job? You know your university has one of the best engineering programs in the world. I don't know, Hassan. I strongly recommend you rethink this You millennials and this business. I don't understand it. What about providing for your family, you know? It's tough, this life is expensive. Mamu, you sound like Papa right now. Then why did he agree to this? He didn't, Mummy did. That that's my sister. She has always lived in her la la land. Mamu, is everything okay? I mean financially. I know you expected me to live in a nice home and pick you up in a BMW. Mamu, you know that's not what I'm talking about. Things didn't turn out the way I expected. You can still stay here until you make some arrangement. Mamu, you know you could have been honest. I'm sorry, I couldn't. We were relying on you.

You look resplendent, - as always. - Thank you. What's the joke? You find my wall of fame funny? No sir. It's just. Relax, I'm fuckin' with you, man. Customers eat that shit up. So, you're a filmmaker, huh? Yes, sir. Your folks must love that, huh? Yeah, they're pretty supportive. So, what can I do for you? I was actually, I was looking for housing. Babaji must have spoken to you about it. You worked in a restaurant before? No sir. Most evening shifts, sometimes during the day, but be flexible, okay? And I want a good, no, I want a great attitude. And no more second chances, got it? - I can't work... - Two things you need to know. One, customer's always right. And two, even though my staff will train you, you take orders from no one but me. I'm the boss. You're on a student visa, right? Yes sir, that's the problem. I'll give you cash. That'll help, right? And I'll cover your housing expenses, but I keep all the tips. Got it? - Yeah. - Good. Okay. Well, welcome to the New Delhi Cafe. - Thank you. - Yeah. You're coming back. How is he going to pay the living expenses? Who is to blame? You tell me. He left my son out on the street. Yeah, Papa, okay. Firstly, he didn't leave me stranded. All right? Just put Mahi on the phone. Mahi's not home. How are you going to pay the rent, tell me? You know this is the biggest accomplishment of my life. I mean, you know that. You support that, so. Mahi, please. Please, Mahi, huh? Just one shot, please, by the window. Fine. Just improvise your lines. But your eye line is looking out, okay? I would like to know how you feel. Ready and action. Mahi! Mahi, you're actually quite amazing at this. All right, this is scene 41. See that? It's up, okay? You're the best sister on this planet. Future storytellers, welcome to the number one film school in the world. It isn't easy to get into this prestigious program, so congratulations on conquering that first step. You are embarking on the hardest four years of your life. So if you have a girlfriend or a boyfriend, just break up right now. If you have a job, quit. This is more than a full-time program. When you graduate, if you graduate, you will be forever changed and more than qualified to share your vision with the world. Good luck to you all. So let's dim the lights and take a look at your presentations. There's something about the streets of Delhi. Dreams, they get lost here. Ambitions don't. Sir, I'm so sorry. First day on the job and you're late? Sir, I can explain, I. Hospitality 101, never ever enter through the front door. You're not a guest. You're a fucking employee and you pull this shit? Aziz. Let me take our VIP here. Sarah, how do you look so beautiful every time I see you? You always look amazing as always. I mean, it's wonderful. What, do you wake up like this? Hassan. Go get her order, she's a special guest. Hello, Welcome to the New Delhi Cafe. Welcome to you, too. You're new. Yes. What would you like? Yes, I'd like to order something to drink. Okay. This is a wine list. I know your menu, sweetheart. I'll have a glass of your sauvignon blanc. Okay. This pops in here. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Halfway, halfway, halfway. Do it again. One second. You're working. Just don't tell Mummy where I work. No tip? No tip. No tip. Seriously? You can start with an MCU, kind of introduce the character slowly as he walks forward. You dolly back, dolly back, dolly back until you're on a master. You see everybody finally when you cut back to master, everybody's gone, he's alone. Then you can cut to the inside of the clock and it's still ticking. Do you remember her? She's in the red dress. It's kind of strange. She's got up and she's like. - Ready? - Mm hm. Okay, so Emmy, how long have you been working at the New Delhi Cafe? About three years. Gustavo, you know you realize you're, you're singing about wanting to go buy a golden earring. Right? I know what the words mean. Okay. You got a problem with that? Huh? I said do you have a problem with that? No, man. Sorry. Who's closing up tonight? I am. - Hassan? - Hm? - You're closing tomorrow. - Huh? No, but I have. Okay, Means fuck Khan and we're going to drink his fucking beer. Alexandro. Alexandro! Choose your partner and choose your partner wisely. You're going to be spending a lot of time with this person. Work on your relationship skills. It's going to be a lot like a marriage. Hopefully you'll do better than me. Anyway, that'll do it for today. And come on down if you have any questions before we start. Okay, - ready Dan? - Yeah. Get in more and more. That should be good. And action. - Looks good. - Yep. Nice. Do you wanna grab some coffee? - Got to go to work. - Work? I didn't order this. I'm sorry, sir. Let me fix this for you. Gustavo, this is not chicken balti, man. Says who? The Indian guyoutside says it, I say it. Oh, no problem. I say it is. Mexican people now in teaching Indians about their food, right? You giving me culinary lessons? Who do you think you are? Mr. Khan had a son, huh? Where does it say green peppers, man? Have you read the recipe for this? Look, it's garlic, ginger, chili powder, onion. Whoa. Gustavo, seriously, what is your problem, man? Okay, mira, attention. This is my balti. I can put whatever I want into it. Whatever I want. I'll fucking put that in there. Fuck it. This is my balti. What is funny? Go, take that to him. Hassan stands motionless, the bowl of balti his hand. He wants to throw it at Gustavo, but instead he turns, gripping the bowl tight as he passes Photoshopped pictures of Delhi, wondering if that's all the American dream is, just Photoshopped reality, A dream that felt so far away. Until, of course, she entered. Hey. Welcome to the New Delhi Cafe. - Hi, for four, please. - Sure. Thanks. Go take the order. Hey, go take the order. Hi. So, chicken Kori Gassi. Thank you. Sandige and rice. Enjoy yourselves. Oh my God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Where's the restroom? How do I know this shit isn't going to happen again? Cut this shit out, okay? Or you are fucking out in the streets. Get the fuck back to work. He doesn't own you, you know. We cannot be artists unless we are tradesmen and craftsmen first. Comes from craft. Craft gets elevated to artistry. This week you guys are gonna write your first screenplay for the film that you'll shoot next semester. The story should be about personal experience. I want to see you. Take a second, just turn around, I just have to focus on you first. Huh? Wait wait, hey. Okay. All right. You ready, huh? It's good. I like that one. Beach pizza party, I'm not gonna go. My eyes are watering a little bit. - I'm gonna stay. - Okay. Hi. Hi. I feel bad about being so rude to you last time. - I'm sorry. - No no, that was my fault. I'm sorry about that. It was really overwhelming. I'm new here. I'm actually studying film direction. - Getting my BFA. - Oh. Wow. Where are you from? I'm from Delhi, actually. Oh, it's in India. India. I've always wanted to go there. How you likin' LA? Yeah, I like it. You know, with school and work and everything, you don't get to see much. My friends are having a party on Saturday in Malibu. - Hassan. - Uh huh? Do you want to come? - Hassan. - Um. I don't know. Maybe, I got stuff to do. - 'Cause I have work. - Yeah. I'm gonna give you my card and just text me if you want to go. Okay. Okay. Okay, bye. Bye. Now with your right hand. Yeah. Yes. So here we go, okay? Put your hands up. Da da da. Oh yeah yeah. Really, realy love it. I love it. You know, some of my best memories are at this beach. I always feel like my truest self when I'm here. If that makes sense. You know, you're really brave. I mean, to just leave home and your parents and your family and start a completely new life. I mean, that takes real courage. I bet that was really hard. You miss them? The way I see it, they're right over there somewhere. I know their ocean bleeds into mine. All right. Mr. Director. - So unique. - Yep. Babaji. Huh? Papa? But doctor, can it be fixed? I mean, what is the next step? If it's serious, then he will need a pacemaker which will require heart surgery. But I think let's not think about that right now. We're on rest duty, you know, stay away from any arduous activity and you know, we will monitor the progress from there. Do you think it'll be an expensive affair? I think you shouldn't think about that right now. And let's check your BP. No. - Nobody talks to Hassan. - Come on, what is this? - Where's the rest? - Next month. No no, that's what you said last month. You are welcome to find other opportunities. Same fucking story every time. You, what about you, Spielberg? Am I forcing you to be here? No. You see this? Yup. So what are we going to do about it? It's Aziz's turn to clean this. That's what's on the slip, so. I sent Aziz home. Wait, I'm closing today? I can't. I have to write a script, I can't close. What a great place to find inspiration for your shitty story, huh? Get to fucking work. Sally. - All right, Patrick. - Thank you. Hassan, here you go. Thank you. Here you go. Good job on that. - Hello? - Hey, Mahi. I just really miss you guys. You're just homesick, okay? You're stronger than this. Aye, come on. This is what we trained for from all those videos. But did you give up? No. Okay? Okay. That's like my brother. And always remember I love you and I'm always there for you. Yep. You're right. Bye, Mahi. Bye. How is everything, good? Thank you for coming. Babaji. Where is Hassan? Where were you? I was just cleaning up the storage room because Babaji told me to do it. You good? Yeah. Ah ha. You made the deadline. It's a new script. Okay, very good. Thank you. Yeah. Okay, do you have your shot yet? Move to your right a little bit. Your other right. - That's left. - Sorry. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Yep, perfect. Okay. So I just want you to talk about how you feel right now. How I'm feeling? Yeah. I don't know. Come on, improvise. I don't know what to say. I'm at the beach, right? Right. What do I say? Talk about the sunset. The sunset? Okay. The sunset reminds me of my mom. I used to ask her why is the sun leaving us and what if it doesn't come back tomorrow? And she would tell me because the sun has to go light up someone else's sky. We can't have the sun all to ourselves. - What? - You hungry? Right now. Right now. I know this dhaba, I'll buy your dinner. What's dhaba? The real stuff. Try the chai, try the chai. What? This is the best chai I've ever had. I mean, all of this is so good. I have to have another cup like this. Hey, let's go in here. - Where? - Come on. Jessica, where are you going? No thanks. We can go. Hassan briskly round street corners on his way back home. The glow of the evening with Jessica now fading from his face. He looks up at the sky and only one star peeks back at him through the city smog. Many of the stars we see are in fact dead, but they're so, so far away their light will only fade from our view thousands of years from now. Maybe that was Jessica. Maybe that was just a dream. - Get up! - Hey man. Where's the tip? There was $30 in there. So where is it? I don't know, man. That was a huge fuckin' party. I'll bet it was over 200 bucks. You think I stole it? There are other, there are 10 other people work here, man. Hassan, don't fucking mess with me. Seriously, I can't stand that asshole anymore. What am I supposed to do? Petty fucking politics. Sir, honestly, don't worry. Sit down. Sorry. What's going on, huh? This is not their order. Well, that is what I was given. - Where's the ticket. - What? Where's the ticket? I threw it. He threw it out. I can't believe he's in my kitchen. Cut it out! Hey! What are you doing here? - Hey! - You work here? Both of you, stop this! Is this my fucking ticket? What the fuck are you doing? What the hell? Hey! Get him outta here! Get him outta here. Get out! You come here again, I'm calling the cops. Easy, Zayen, easy. Easy? I gave this ungrateful fuck a job, somewhere to stay, and this is how you repay me? Fuck you, man. - Fuck you, Zayen. - Okay, okay. He speaks. You got a voicemail, Spielberg? Is that what your parents taught you in that shit hole of village you're from, huh? To come here and beg and steal. What do you know about me and my family, man? Huh? Speak English. Fuck you. Babaji, this guy, he steals from us and then he labels us thieves. - I steal from you? - Yeah. - I steal from you? - You steal from me. You're the biggest - thief of all, man. - Get the fuck outta here. All right, that's it for today. I'll see you next week. Hassan, can I have a word with you please? Okay, let's see. Hassan, why do you want to be a filmmaker? I think is the only medium where I feel I can express myself. You know, the six senses. I really like the take my emotions and my feelings and put them up on screen. And hopefully one day I'll be able to give to the audience at least a glimpse of the true human condition. And just the process of taking text and then transforming it onto cellulite, it's an absolute miracle for me. I read your script. It's very good. You have a technical understanding of character building, catharsis and plot structure. I can see in your exercises that you have a good understanding of cinematography and visual storytelling. You might be a fan of Fellini. - I love Fellini. - But you're not Fellini. You are Hassan, and I want to see Hassan. You have to have the courage to go into those dark and vulnerable places, and you're not there yet. Now the good news is you can develop it. That's what the school is for, to develop your voice. Comes from here. But you have to be honest. That's the human dilemma. Those are the stories we want to see. Sir, I've been going through some financial pressure. I've been working at this restaurant like late at night. - Hassan. - No, sir. - I quit. - Hassan. - I'm going to focus. - It's okay, all right? Timing is everything in life. Take some time off, go back to India maybe, sort out your financial things, and come back when you're ready. International tuition is very expensive and I'd hate to see you not do well. Because it's due for next semester in a month. I know, I know. There's a slight problem. Just wondering, Hassan, if you could just talk to the school and manage this semester somehow. Do you think that we can do that? Do you think that they can give us three more days? Or we can pay them in installments? Your grades aren't high enough, Hassan. I have stacks of applicants in your year with 4.0's, 4.3's. No, I know, sir, but I actually really need this job before next semester. I can't. Sir, I'm having loan problems - and I can't go back to India. - Hassan, look. I can't. Ah shit. - All right. - Do you have napkins? All right, look, y'know kid, I can pay you minimum wage, right? Huh? Would that work for you? Yes sir. Everything helps, sir. Okay. All right, all right. Thank you, thank you. Thank you, sir. ♪ You can run ♪ You can hide ♪ Try to avoid Hi.

I want to go see Paris and I want to go to India. Uh oh. My family will disown me. For traveling? No, for not getting a job after I graduate. If I graduate. You just need to take a deep breath and trust that everything is gonna work out. Everything always works out. Everything? Yeah, everything. It always does. I think it's time. He will require the surgery. I think we should start immediately. Ma'am, I'm sorry. Sorry, ma'am. We require full payment. - What? - It's our policy. Please understand. I totally understand that, but you need to understand my father, he needs surgery right now. Please, I mean, come on. Sorry. I'm sorry. Well how can you say that? Please help me. These are very expensive. Mahi. You have an insurance, ma'am? No. Yeah, yeah. Let's go, this is fine. Hey, Mahi, guess where I am. It's not good. I don't know what to do, I'm sorry. Hassan? If I give you this loan, how do you plan to pay it back? I'll come back full time. I'll work it off. He can. No second chances. Okay? Thank you. You're a good son, you know? You are. Don't lose hope. Come here. - Sally. - Here. - Elliot. - Here. Hassan. Yes. How do you say chandelier? Chandelier. The two in Farsi, pretty similar. I know, it's amazing. Hey Hassan, it's me calling again. Just wanted to make sure we're still on for Christmas dinner tomorrow. Call me back. Okay, bye. Merry Christmas. Hey Hassan, go take the order. How are you? Fine. So what can I get you guys? You decide. Sure. That's okay. I'll be fine. I waited for you all night. I've been calling you all week. I have to work, all right? - I'm sorry. - No, no, you could have found a way. You knew that this was important to me. Not all of us have that privilege, okay? What's gotten into you? Stop. Why are you being like this? Is everything okay? Jessica, you know nothing about me. You know nothing about my life. You don't know anything. All right? How's this gonna work? I mean, look at you and look at me. - Stop. - No. It's not gonna work. Stop thinking you can save me. Perhaps for some of us, it's just that, a dream you can only look at from a wide shot. Hassan was just infatuated with her, maybe because she reminded him of old Hollywood movies. Perhaps he knew he could never have her. Hope deferred makes the heart sick and can even kill a man, he remembers someone saying. I am so proud of you. Mummy, don't talk like that. Why would I be upset? Make me sound so heartless. You can't have everything you want, no? Remember, that's what Papa used to say. You mark my words. I love you, Hassan. ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh Hassan, can I just say that it takes a courageous man to follow a dream, but it takes a wise man to know when to walk away from it. ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh ♪ Ooh Babaji, not this again. No, you're going to have to push your trip back. I mean, money's tight. Damn refrigerator repairs took this month's profits. And I can't leave other people in charge here if you're not here. Okay okay. So how much you want. How much you want, how much? 200? 500? Babaji, you're man of principal now? Where were your principals when I was paying your daughter's school for years? Don't forget that. Take it. Get back to work, Babaji. Babaji. Surprise. Sorry. Sorry, Babaji. - Bye. - Thank you. Thanks. Thanks. Hey, Babaji, what happened? Babaji's not feeling well. He needs to rest. We'll Skype Geeta later, okay? What are you doing? You know, flaco, not everybody can get loans from Khan. Gustavo, put the money back. You think I'm scared of you? Man, look, I'm not gonna let you leave with the money, all right? So just put it down and I'll forget all about it. You're gonna stop me? Hmm, flaco? Fuck you, man, I'm not. Babaji. Babaji. Babaji, Gustavo stole the tips. Babaji? Hey Chandan. Chandan? Chandan, Babaji. He's not waking up. Chandan. Babaji. Babaji, don't go. Babaji. Babaji. Babaji. We need to call the ambulance, okay? What happened to Babaji? Babaji! Babaji, wake up! Wake up! Babaji. Thank you, bye. Thank you for all of this. I love you. Why don't you come visit LA sometime, you know? There's just a lot to see over here. Yeah. I know, but I can't leave this country until I get my green card and legal status and all that. You sound like a captive. Why? Do you think things will ever be the same again? Mahi, I promise you, okay. It's gonna be like I never left. Is this what I wanted? I just ended up being like everyone else. Hey, don't say that. I will always be living for somebody else, an arranged marriage. That's not true, okay? That's not true. That was an improv. Weirdo. I have to go. But I mean, you need anything, or anything, just call me, okay? The customer's always right, but you take orders only from me. No second chances, you understand? You got your student visa, right? I'll pay in cash. That'll help, right? Welcome to New Delhi Cafe. Thank you. He can take your things. Hassan watches the new bus boy as if staring into the mirror of his own past. And it's in this very moment he sees the vicious cycle. It's in every face of every restaurant worker. And though sometimes to an outsider, every one of those faces looks the same, every story is different. And now I have a story. And It's all mine to tell My husband, he have a visa to working in America. You know, the H1B visa. - Yeah. - Uh huh. And he have a job. It's a very good. And then we had a daughter. We left Iraq during the war. My father had enough. One night, a bomb hit our home and the window came down on my brother. So he got us out of there. Right now, he is back in Korea, but I cannot go. My daughter's, she is American. I cannot go back to Korea. I saw him about five years ago. Five years? Five years. And I don't have my papers so I can go back. Yeah, I am here working. You know, when we first come, we not illegal. No one wants to be illegal, but. Is this what you thought your life would be when you came to America?
