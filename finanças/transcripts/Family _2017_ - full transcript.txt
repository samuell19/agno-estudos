There's a split second between "I should" and "better not" which gives you time to think time to restrain yourself from doing what you want. Whether it's killing yourself or someone else, you have one moment to choose between reason and impulse or a cold shower to relax. But too many cold showers might make you cold enough to deliver and your reason and impulse become "lets go". What? I'm sorry about the time, is Carmela home? No. -Okay, no, wait. Yes? I think it's an emergency. Can I leave a note? You think it's an emergency? -I have to see her. Can I come in and write her a note? Do I look like a notebook with a pen stuck up my ass? What? Can't you text her? -No, wait, wait. I have to see her. Can I wait inside? Please, I'll write everything down. It's really important, can I? Thanks. -DR. ELKAYAM - PSYCHOLOGIST- Is it your birthday? Mom's Really? So what's your emergency? What's your diagnosis? Why do you see my mom? It's personal. You're not skinny enough to be anorexic, not pretty enough to be a narcissist, definitely not sexy enough to be a nymphomaniac. You don't look creative enough to be a pathological liar, so what are you? You look guilty. What did you do? Did you set your house on fire? Rob a bank? Run someone over? Rape? Get raped? Steal? Kill? I won't stay long, okay? Hey, give that back. Stop. Give that back, it's mine. Carmel you're the only person I owe an explanation to. No friends, huh? Give that back. Intriguing, what did you do? -Give it back! I wanted you-to know the fact . I don't expect you to visit me in jail. I know you told me to move out on time. I said I should stay to take care of them. Of whom? You were right. I stayed and now they're... You stopped there. They're what? What did you do? I just want to wait for your mom, okay? I don't know when she's coming back. We made birthday plans so you're not staying. What plans? -It's none of your business. I only need ten minutes with her. Tell me what you did. I might change my mind. Can I have some water, please? -FAMILY PORTRAIT CONTEST- Hello. Hi. But the lease ends on November. Can't we figure something out? But I work here. That's your emergency? No, it's not. So go on. The studio is the only place... that's mine. Well.. I went to my dad. I didn't want to see him. I knew he wouldn't help. He brings you down? Do you talk to my mom about him? Of course. I didn't have any other ideas. -FATHER- I don't get along with my dad. il^ly face represents everything he hates. I. see it every time he looks at me, pretending to listen. You're washing her? -I have to. She should know it's wrong. She knows, look at her. You let her do whatever she wants. I'm sick of you. Sick and tired of you. After Mom divorced him Dad started hating But he wanted to show his employees he was a good dad. I'd come to his office with receipts of medication I bought for mom and my sister. He would make sure it happened on prime time. so everyone coU(d see Give me the receipts. I didn't buy the pills yet. What do you mean? So why are you here? I have a problem. I need your help. I can't. You didn't hear the problem. Well? My studio rent went up. How is that my problem? My rent went up. I work as much I can, but I have to take care of Mom and Smadar. I can't pay my rent. I need your help. It would help me. So move back home. -I live at home. I work at the studio. I'm a photographer. I can't work at home. So take photos at home. Here are the tickets. Thanks, honey. Lily, do you need a ride? Yes, I do. -No, I'll drive her. It's on my way. It's fine, I'll take her. Are you sure? -Yes. I planned on taking her to lunch anyway. This conversation is over. I can't help you and stop looking for trouble. Where are you flying to? -China. Business or pleasure? Stay out of my wallet, honey. Our emotions, where do I start? It would be simple if we could control everything, but we cant IVe can't control the volume of our emotions. You're saying we're a sack of emotions that we can't predict. everything that happens, affects our perspective. Our goal throughout life is to feel good. Unbelievably stupid. Who gave her a car? I thought I took this. This is also mine. She doesn't even like Gauguin. Why don't you call a cleaner? We're saving up for a trip to China. No, no, no. Don't play with that. Give it back. How does it work? -It's none of your business. Show me. If you'd have gone to the army, you'd know. Show me. -I don't have time. Dad, come on. Please. Okay. Gun. Front sight. Rear sight. Slide. Barrel. Butt. Trigger. Trigger guard. Safety switch. The first thing you need is a target. Only aim it at things you want dead. Always treat it like it's loaded even if it isn't. Is it? -Of course. Spread your legs. Spread them. Shoulders back. Back. You need ear and eye protection because the noise is loud, and the hot bullet shell can hurt your eyes. Okay. Did you find a target? -Not yet. Straighten your arms. Shoulders Next up, disabling the safety. Switch it off only before you shoot. Don't do it now, but that's how it works. The most important thing is to breathe. You breathe to make people stop breathing? Breath and sight are the most important elements. Like in photography. Your target should be out of focus in front of you. Focus on the front, got it? Yes. Forget what you saw in the movies. Your target can't be too high or too low. Your target and sight should be on the same line or you lose your target. I found it. -Always wash your hands. The powder is dangerous for your skin. We all know you have enough skin problems as it is. There's a split second between "I should" and "better not" which gives you time to think time to restrain yourself from doing what you want. Whether it's killing yourself or someone else, you have to choose between reason and impulse or a cold shower to relax. I have to go. Give me the gun. But too many cold showers might make you cold enough to deliver. I want a blank check. Do I look like an ATM machine? Give me your wallet. Give me the gun. This isn't funny. You can't rob someone you know. Someone I know? I'm your daughter, remember? You're getting on my nerves. Give me the gun. -Why? Look at us. I don't have time to play this game with you. Shit, I'm sorry. Fuck, Lily, you shot me! What did you expect? That I'd never explode? That you'd treat me this way and I'll just swallow? And take care of you when you're old? You're so stupid. If we weren't related you'd be in jail. Related? It's called a daughterl Shut up and call an ambulance! What for? Can't you see we're finally talking? But you're right, we have nothing in common. Besides a lot of blood. Give me the gun. I need a hospital! When I saw the blood, it was beautiful. It was real. Maybe it was a mistake or years of delayed self defense. I finally stood up to him. e finally shared an honest moment. I felt that... yes. I really did want him dead. To feel free. I had done many things in my life, but killing my father felt like the first thing I ever did. I told myself that if I left the house, all this would erase itself by the time I go back. Hi, Lily. Hi, Freddy. Can you sell me a cigarette? Let's share? How are you? Fine. How's school? Great. Great. So thanks. You're welcome. Hours of cigarettes went by but nothing had changed. I still killed my father. I had to tell someone. Bullshit. What? You're lying. I'm not. You're not telling this to my mom on her birthday. Get out. I'm staying. You can go if you want. Don't you have any friends? No. Everybody has friends. She left the flashlight for me. What do you mean? Sisters have their "thing". This was ours. Do you have any siblings? No. Welcome to the best dance contest in the world ever of all times. And the nominee is.. And the winner is.. And the jury is... Me. Stay. -SISTER- Why did she do it? Mayibe she ran out of reasons to get up. Why do others get up? Maybe they love something. Did you get it? Yes, what are you doing? It's a secret surprise. What are you doing? Smadar. Smadar, no, no, no. No, no, no. Quiet. Why did you do that? Why? I hate you! I hate you too! Get out and leave me alone! Leave me alone already! Leave me alone, stop! I will! Stop, I don't want to. -What? Don't, Mama. Quiet! Quiet! Quiet! Quiet. Quiet! show you. Stop! Mama, let go! Stop! Quiet! I'm sorry. It's okay, Mama. Are you okay? Mama. What? I'm hungry. Make me a sandwich? Go to your room. No... No! I hate you! I'm sick of feeling bad because of you! You're my worst nightmare! You're a punishment! You're a punishment! -You're a punishment! You're a punishment! -You're a punishment! Why didn't you help her? I tried. Whose side are you on? I tried to be on both sides until it got rough. Smadi. You're not nice to me and now you'll need me. I hope you've learned your lesson, Mama. Smadi, what are you doing? No, it's cold, Smadi. Let me go. I'm cold, I'm cold. Smadi, you're not going. No, you can't go. Don't go. Smadi, let me go! Smadi! Are you crazy? Where are you going? Smadi! You're evil! You're evil! You're evil! Let me go, it hurts! I'll get you. You have no idea. It's locked. Open up! Smadar. This isn't funny. Smadar. Open the door. Smadar, please! Smadar! Why be a bitch? Why are you? I have my reasons. She had mom. I'm sick of this, Lily. I don't feel anything for her. I don't want to see her or hear her. Mama, quiet. I hope she didn't hear me. I shouldn't talk like this. She makes me. can't take it anymore, you know? I'm not a bad mother. I'm afraid of her, I'm afraid she might hurt herself. What, Mama? When they talk about her suicidal potential I pray for it but then I tell myself what kind of mother thinks like this? Maybe I deserve this. You think I deserve this. Maybe the new pills will help her. Even pills have their limits. Goodbye, girls. -Thank you. Door man. Door man. Do you have a light? Keep it. Good luck with the door, huh? Do you smell that? What is it? Is my room ready? So hard to say after years and years of days. Maybe I'm a big mistake to make probably the biggest one you've ever made. What if I don't count? I'm just time chewed in your mouth. I scream but you can't hear the sound of me break but I do and it aches. None of you can fix this mess without breaking your own necks. I'm a fatal accident in your way. I'm your hit and run every day Dig and bury what you need. I'm just a bag of blood and greed. Too heavy to float that's me. Too heavy to float at sea. What do you want? What do you want? I brought you food. I don't eat anymore. Aren't you hungry? You and your food don't exist. Being crazy doesn't mean you can talk like a psycho. Your existence is useless and you have no purpose so your food isn't real and if it were real I have* no purpose so I shouldn't be fed. Why don't you have a purpose? Because I'm not pretty anymore. You're beautiful. Then why am I locked up in a cage? You're crazy, not ugly. Leave your food and go. I love you. What did you say? I love you. Eat. Eat. Tell me.. How can you still believe me? What do you mean? -HOME- I always thought I'd be relieved. Were you? No. Who would feel relieved after a suicide? -Shut up. I'd kill myself if you were my sister. Why am I talking to you? You're just being mean. Okay. I'm sorry, okay? This is what happens when I'm myself, okay? My mom isn't the angel you think she is. She has time for everyone besides me. It pisses me off. My dad lives ih Germany. He's too busy to care. And my mom's idiot husband hates me. No one gives a fuck about me. So I'm angry. Everyone who comes close fucks me over. If not sexually, then in other ways. There are millions of ways to fuck people over. I don't have enough self esteem to be anorexic. I try and quit after five days tops. I hate myself too much to be a narcissist. I don't know... what it feels like to love myself. Just how it feels to hate people who do. The funny and ironic part is that I know I'm certain that my mom is an amazing shrink and if I were her patient and not her fucking daughter... Talia. Lily. I want to hear your story because your life is much worse than mine. I know it's sick and it's bad karma but it makes me so happy so go on. Smadi? Despite all my secret hopes I knew she couldn't deal with the heartache. I knew without experiencing it that this is the worst form of pain I could ever imagine. This amount of guilt would stay with her. Every breath she took until her final breath. These feelings are something a daughter shouldn't let a mother feel. Don't touch me. I'm a monster. No, you're not. I am. You don't know me. I'm a monster. That's what I am. I'm a monster. I'm a monster, understand? That's what I am. Don't. Let me go. Mama. Why didn't you pick me up? I don't want this anymore. I don't want to pick you up from school. I don't want to live with you. I want to be alone. -It's too late. We're not some shoe you can return to the store. I don't want to speak to you. You don't? No problem, I'm going. I'm going out tonight, Mama. I'll drink and do drugs and give blowjobs to strangers, okay? You don't want me here? Fine, bye. Maybe if you took your pills, you'd be less pathetic. Your fucking pills. Maybe you could even raise a family, you stupid bitch! You're disgusting! Pathetic! Don't. Don't. Adam, don't. Don't. Stop it! MOM: I'M ON MY WAY How did you tell your mom? In the least painful way I could think of. At that time there was no other way. I could only do what made sense to me. It's like I had a vision I couldn't fight off. I was like a machine you can't turn off. The only thing my head and my heart agreed on was that if I don't finish what I started the world would shatter into pieces of endless pain. After years of being told what's best for me I knew what's best for her. What? It's okay, Mama. I just want to talk. About what? The door is for your own good. My birthday is coming up. I thought it's a good time to apologize for everything. Smadi If this is an introduction to something awful I won't handle it. You don't lie in apologies. I mean it, Mama. Did you take your pills? I think so, Lily knows. But she's not here. Want to take them? No, you're lying. You want to hurt me. No, Mama. If something happens to me, no one will take care of you. You know that, right? I know, Mama. So no tricks. No tricks. You haven't been this nice in years. I know, I'm sorry. It's a shame you became the crazy one. It's too bad Lily didn't get your madness. What do you mean? It's a shame we can't switch your disorders. You still can, you know? Be a real dancer outside your room. Lily and Adam were more generous, but... I wanted the dream for you. I know, Mama. You're talented. It's too bad you became what you are. I think about it when I watch TV. On TV they take their kids to Europe. They eat together on weekends. They hug. They pretend mothers and daughters get along. It looks pretty to love out loud but I guess... You know... we're... different. We can try, Mama. We can dress up and go out. No way. Where would we go? There's a bar nearby with people our age. Maybe they'll buy us a drink and dance with us and tell us jokes we've never heard. Want to? Come. I'll help you with your cane. No, you're lying. You want to hurt me. Come on. Where is my cane? -Here. Come. Lets get dressed. Do you think the blue one still fits? Try it on, Mama. I'll crush the pills to make them easier to swallow. Okay, Mama? You look amazing. Really? -Yes. You're pale, why don't you drink something? I look pretty today, right? Drink, Mama. Drink up. What about this, Mama? We shouldn't mix. Here. -Okay. Cheers. -Cheers. It's good. It's beautiful, Mama. What? -What? I don't feel good. You're tired. Maybe you're excited. Yes. I should lie down. So come, Mama. Just for a minute. Just for a minute and then we'll go. I love you, Mama. Just for a minute. Can I hug you good night? It's for your own good. Let me. I thought I would feel something. Nausea guilt or regret. Anything. Nothing? Nothing. -MOTHER- Lily? Carmela, hi. Talia, what's going on? Who are you? -She's my patient. Happy Birthday, Mom. -Are you smoking pot? Great. Great birthday present, Talia. -My pleasure, jerk. What's going on? Lily, why are you here? I had to talk to you. You're Lily? Yes, hello. Avi, let me, okay? She doesn't work for free anymore, go home. Avi, you don't complain when you freeload. Lily, lets go to my office. Talia, we'll talk later. Later, of course. Baby. e've discussed this. It's none of your business. -Fuck that. Fuck that. -Talia! What did you want to talk about, Mom? Avi, you should go. What? I should be with her. What? I should be with her. Are you asleep? Hey. Smoke? Thanks. Is it okay if... What? I'm dying to pee. Sorry. No, stay. Okay. How are you feeling? I don't know. I can't describe it. When I don't know what I'm feeling, you know what I do? I take a shower. I look at the steam on the mirror and ask myself Talia, how do you feel? Then I paint a face on the mirror. If it's a happy face I know I'm fine and if it's sad I know nothing has changed. It makes me calm. I always wanted to piss on his grave but this is good enough. For calling me a retard. -Why are you home? For shutting me up. For ruining mom... -Adam, stop, he's dead. And Smadar. What are you doing here? -What do you mean? I missed my family. Really? They sent me home to erase some photos. Want to see? -No. Is anyone home? -They're asleep. Who killed dad? Dad. Here? Fucked up, isn' Are you lying? That's your lying face. Are you lying to me? What's with you? What did you do? You look guilty. I missed you. Why are you wearing Smadar's uniform? Is this a game? Should I look for clues? And Mom? She's asleep. Mom. Mom, I'm home. Mom. I'm hungry. Make me a sandwich? Want to hear a joke? No. Sure you do. Listen. Three frogs sit by a lake. One goes "quack". The second goes "quack, quack". The third one looks at them and goes "quack"... "quack"... "quack". The first frog notices. He takes out his gun aims... fuck! What's wrong with you? -"What's wrong with you"? That's exactly what the second frog says so the first frog says "I had to". "He knew too much". Not funny. At least the frog didn't kill his entire family. I'll do the dishes. Why her? She didn't deserve it. I don't want to talk about it. You don't know because you don't live here. I know you killed my mom. I don't have a mom anymore. Who will cook dinner? Is that what you'll miss? Who will do the laundry? Who will shine my shoes? Watch the news all day? Complain about Smadar? Who will spill coffee? Who won't ask me how I'm doing? Who won't give a uck about her kids? Or ask me what I do in the army? Who will do my fucking laundry? Stop it! I'll do your laundry, okay? Shouldn't you be dead too? Did you plan to kill yourself and leave me behind? No. I'm calling the police. Why would you do that? Because you broke the law and I am a law obedient citizen. Maybe I'll call them about you. And say what? You know what I'll say. I'm calling them. If you don't want to go to jail, kill yourself. No. No? But that's what I want, and that's what's going to happen. Those are the rules, remember? The world does as I say. Or else? -No "or else". The rules of the game are simple. Don't be difficult. Police? Yes. Someone killed me family without permission. Now I'm a sad orphan. Please come for the killer. She deserves to be punished. I believe execution is best for her future. What? I know Israel doesn't officially execute, but... Who are we kidding? I'm not doing it! Sure you are. Prison is much worse than this house. The clock’s ticking. Liar. I know what your weight sounds like when it falls. What are you doing? I'm your brother, sicko. You really want it, don't you? Nobody wants it from you. You do. -No way, that's sick. It doesn't look like it sickens you. We better hurry. They're on their way. When you're on trial, you better do some research. Prisons are like universities. You better find a good one you could get a decent job If you finish your degree. a few years you're out. It's only your first triple homicide. Lily, watch it. After three you're a serial killer. So this bunny goes to the woods, okay? He sees a Panda bear lying on the ground bleeding his ass off. What's up, man? The bear says "the polite donkey". The bunny keeps going. Suddenly he sees the lion. The king himself on the ground bleeding and crying his eyes out. Lion. Lion, what's up? The lion says "the polite donkey". So the bunny knows the woods aren't safe anymore. He takes a wine cork and sticks it up his anus. A moment later he hears a noise. He freezes and the woods are dark and scary. Then he hears "good evening, sir". I didn't really call the police. I find it beautiful that you can't shoot me. It makes me sad. It makes me happy- I'm we ruined you. Okay. I know I could have prevented a lot of things but I'm certain that I loved you more than the others did. Even if I sucked at showing it. I want to help you. Help me? This could all be my fault. But it's not. -But it also is. You better go. I'll take care of it. Adam, maybe you should be quiet. You don't need this with me. I'm not like them. I'm like you. Just not as interesting. I need a shower. You don't belong here. Hi. Mom? I'm sorry about before. It's okay. -Are you crying? No, it's okay. Don't worry. Happy Birthday, Mom. Thanks, honey. Did you like the party? So hard to say after years and years of days. Maybe I'm a big mistake to make- Probably the biggest one you ever made. What if I don't count? If I'm just time chewed in a mouth? I scream but no one hears the sound of me break but I do and it aches. None of you can fix this mess without breaking your own necks. I'm a fatal accident on your way. I'm your hit and run every day. Dig and bury what you need. I'm just a bag of blood and greed. Too heavy to float at sea. Too heavy to float that's me. There's never a good time to leave. There's never a good time to leave. There's never a good time to leave. No, there's never a good time to leave. -BROTHER- Hi, Lily. Hi, Freddy. I wanted to make sure you're okay. Are you okay? Yes. -Then so am I. Are you sure? Yes, I'm just cleaning up. Why are you cleaning up? Why are you cleaning up? I'm not. Neither am I. Okay. -Okay. Are you wearing lipstick? Maybe. Why is your dad lying on the floor? He's asleep. He had a long day. You look pretty with the lipstick. Come here. -Where? Here. I'm close. Closer. Hey. Are you here? Yes. -Do you want coffee? I'll make coffee. Do you drink black? Why black? There's no milk. TO: THE FAMILY PORTRAIT CONTEST Where are you going? On vacation. Can I come visit? Maybe when you're eighteen. What if I miss you? Then you'll be sad for ten minutes. How do you know it's just for ten minutes? I don't. My brother always said the only thing that's certain is death and porn. Will you miss them for ten minutes? There are four of them. So forty. Here's my ride. Don't forget to submit that. I've never won anything. Here. Thanks. There's a home where I belong. Not made of stone but flesh and bone. It's got your name, your blood, your veins. It's got my heart all torn apart by your flames. I might look like I do. But if you want to know the truth you'd see I'm bits and pieces of your missing kisses. Red, oh pretty red turned blue- And if it's me you miss I'll run as fast as a kiss. As fast as a kiss turns to a fist. And if you need me nearby I'll come as fast as a hi. As fast as a hi turns to goodbye. -FATHER- I might sound out of tune. It's just the full moon. -MOTHER- -SISTER- And if it's me you miss I'll run as fast as a kiss. /Is fast as a kiss turns to a fist. -BROTHER- And if you need me nearby I'll come as fast as a hi. /Is fast as a hi turns to goodbye. There's a home where I belong. Not made of stone but flesh and bone. It's got your name, your blood, your veins. I want you here but you ain't near and that's a shame.
