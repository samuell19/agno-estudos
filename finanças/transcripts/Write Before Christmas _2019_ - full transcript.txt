♪ "La, la, la, la" Hey! I was just Photoshopping you. Wes. Oh, not that Christmas card thing again. Well, I could Photoshop you out. Can you? Look, I know you're not a big "holiday" guy, but it's just a picture. With a wreath... and some mistletoe. And maybe even a snow globe. - Jessica... - Okay, fine. No snow globe. You want to grab drinks tonight? Sure. I'll text you. Okay. Bye. Merry Christmas. You want the moon? Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down. Let me guess. It's a Wonderful Life? You caught me, Jess. "You want the moon?" "Just say the word and I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down." Never gets old. 'Cause you're a romantic. Not really. I mean, who's gonna give someone the moon, right? You never know. Yeah, I kinda do. Wow, Joe. I've never seen these before. I thought you were sending out photos this year. Oh, I am. But these are for the guy in the photos. Can I get a hot cocoa today, Joe? Extra marshmallows? You know it. - Coming right up. - Thank you. - Oh! Sorry. - It's okay. Morning, Mims. More decorations? You can never have enough Christmas. Speaking of "enough Christmas"-- how's Dr. Handsome? Still "Bah, humbug," and still not a doctor. He's an eye doctor. That's an optometrist. He's an optician. An optometrist goes to med school. He fits people for glasses, which is important if you can't see. Anyhow, yes, I have a few plans lined up. A "Jessica Christmas"? No. But... I bought him these five cards. I'm gonna send him one every day this week. I think that will get him into the spirit, right? I mean, who doesn't love opening a Christmas card? I approve. And then we're gonna go caroling on Wednesday. Followed by ice skating on Thursday, leading up to Christmas Eve at Aunt Lila's. Too much? How about you just stick with the cards? But aren't these cute? They're so cute. Oh, hey, Ruth. How's the recorder coming, Joshua? He wants to try a new instrument for Christmas. Guitar. Ahh... ladies love a guitar player. But I keep telling him the violin looks better on college apps. Well, there is always that, but sometimes the instrument picks the musician. What do you play? I play the cello. That's the really big one, right? Mm-hmm. That's actually why I picked it at first. I had a really mean bus driver and it took up two seats. But turns out, I ended up loving with it. Go ahead and look around. Seeing as we're on the subject of your love of the cello, did I mention my cousin at the Chicago Heritage Orchestra called? Or maybe I called him. Mimi. Turns out one of their cello players just left. What a shame. Just let me get you an audition. I am way out of practice. So, practice. I just... Maybe another time. That's a really great starter guitar. You like it? - Yeah. - Looks cool. Joshua? Thank you so much. He'll love it. Bye, guys. Merry Christmas. They'll be back for a guitar before the new year, trust me. Dr. Handsome? We're having drinks tonight, at Primo's. Primo's? "The Proposal Palace"? It's near his office. Do you know how many couples get engaged at Primo's? He's not proposing. It's only been three months. Remember him? Mm... mm! Cute. Mm. Very cute. Wake up, Sunshine. Hey, you didn't, uh, happen to bring me an espresso, did you? That's a little out of my job description. You're my manager. Also your brother. Get up. So, you ready for that Christmas gig? What Christmas gig? You know how hard I had to work to get you that spot? I'm opening for a 12-year-old. He should be at home with his parents. He's 17 and he has 50 million followers. When did "fans" become "followers"? Oh, let's see, about the time that you split up the band? I'm not sure I want people following me. I'm not sure I want to get up there and sing that song. People love that song again. You are that song. Unless, of course, you want to write a new one. "Luv U On Christmas" it is. I thought so. Oh, maybe that will inspire you. I like their candy canes, don't you? You know what I love? Crosswords. ♪ Christmas is here... No, not Jax, please. Hey, can someone urn that off? Hey, uh... Private Carter Winthrop? Oh, uh... Um, I thought you were... Just... Yeah, it's not that I don't like Christmas music. It's just not that. Uh, my sister, she-- Can you sign, please? Sure. Yeah. Uh... Sorry. Uh... Yeah, I'm-I'm making it... making it worse. Here's your alternators. Think I can alternate the last two minutes? Not unless you have a time machine. Merry Christmas. Smooth. You saw that? Just tell her you like her. What's the point? Shipping out in two weeks. She's here now, you're here now. Seize the moment! Pretty sure I just blew the moment. Good morning, CJ. Good morning, Jessica. Morning, Auntie Lila. Honey, you don't need to check in on me every day. Although I appreciate it. I know it's gonna be a quiet Christmas this year with Carter away, but I am bringing Wes. You asked him? Almost. Did you get your tree yet? I think I'm gonna skip it this year. But you are making your famous fruitcake, right? Working on it! Sure. Honey, don't worry about me. In fact, I'm just on my way out. 13 shopping days, right? - I love you. - I love you, too. Bye. Let's do the proposal. Ahem. Oh, honey, you were on the other knee. Who's gonna know? This is our place. I want to look back on this moment and remember exactly how you asked me. And now look into each other's eyes as if you are the only two people in the entire world on Christmas. Or at least in the restaurant. All right! I got it. They're perfect. All right. I'm glad you're happy. Oh, Luke... are you in a relationship? Uh, no. Great. I'd really love to introduce you to one of my bridesmaids. Uh, thanks. I just-- I don't like to mix work-- She's amazing. I'm sure she is, but... I mean, I want to be focused on your wedding-- You can meet her before the wedding. I have a really good feeling about this. So what is better for you, tomorrow or the day after? Do you know what? I'll just text you her info. You're gonna love her. I have a good feeling! - Thanks, Luke. - Thanks, Luke. What just happened? Hey, Luke. So, I, uh... Taking pictures of ornaments now? I, uh, need this room. Yeah, for the customers. Right. I'm on my way. I owe you, Primo. Yes. Yes, you do. You... get to be Santa. I'm Santa every year, Primo. That's at Saint Mary's, but you also get to be Santa at my nephew's birthday. 9:00 a.m. Sharp. I want you to take good care of these guys. They're here for their anniversary. Okay? Thanks again, Primo. - See you tomorrow. - See you tomorrow. 9:00 a.m.! Thank you. Make sure they have a great time and we'll get their next party. Sorry I'm late. Oh. It's "National Eye Exam" Day. Oh! Merry... C-H-R-I-S... I'm sorry. Am I'm making a "spectacle" of myself? Ahh. So, uh... Christmas shopping? Not exactly. Well, if you're wondering about what to get me... "You can just get me the moon, George Bailey." It's a Wonderful Life? - The movie? - Oh, I didn't see it. Would you like to see a menu, Dr. Dade? Can you give us a minute? Uh... Cheers. So... So. Holidays are closing in. Look, I know you think I'm overdoing it, with the traditions and the plans, but just... Christmas has always been so special to me. And this year, with my brother away and my aunt being alone, I just really want to keep that spirit alive. I know, which is kind of why I wanted to do this now. Jessica... we've been seeing each other for three months. - Mm-hmm. - And what do they say? It takes three months to get to know somebody. I've never heard that. The thing is... what, we've had 20, 25 dates? Not counting the phone calls, the texts, the emails... I think I know all I need to know for what I'm about to say. Jessica... No! I mean, maybe. It's too soon. We haven't even said "I love you" yet. I mean, not that I couldn't love you. In time, but... I mean, what if you are the one for me, and I just don't know it yet? Oh, God. I was gonna say I think we should stop seeing each other. What? I just-- I think we've run our course, and I really need to focus on my practice. You left these at my place. Oh. Are you ready to order, Dr. Dade? You know, he's not even a doctor. He makes bifocals. I am so... sorry. Who breaks up with someone at "the Proposal Palace"? I am so humiliated. And right before Christmas? I don't want to marry him. Of course you don't. I don't even think I liked him that much. I never liked him. Why didn't you say anything? Would you have listened? No. Sweetie... this is what you do-- you pick the same stuffed shirts that you're never gonna really fall for, and when it ends, well... you don't feel anything. I feel stupid. And tomorrow you're gonna feel relieved. You've been through a lot. Who hasn't? You lost your parents. Jess... you were so young. That changes everything. I know. But you can't keep picking the wrong guys just to avoid feeling hurt. One day, the right one's gonna come along and he's gonna be worth the risk. Or... I just stop. Stop what? All of it. Yeah, I-I'm taking a holiday from dating. And while I'm at it, I'm taking a holiday from the holidays. That's ridiculous. No. This year, Christmas will just be another day on the calendar, between Thanksgiving and New Year's. You'll spend Christmas with us and John's parents in Michigan. Auntie Lila, too. Thank you, but she doesn't want to celebrate this year either. We are fine right here-- just the two of us. I feel better already. It's open. Hi, honey. - Hi, Jess. - Hey. - Merry Christmas. - Is it? This was outside the door. Oh. Thanks. "Jessica, we're so proud of the amazing young woman you have become. Love Uncle CJ and Aunt Lila." "Dear Jessica, for always knowing how to put a smile on my face. We will be friends forever. Love Mimi." "You're the best sister a guy could ask for. Thanks for always being there for me. Love Carter." "Dearest Lug Nut... I bought these... for someone else... ...But now I think they were for me." ♪ Fa, la, la, la, la la, la, la, la ♪ Aww! Yeah. And Merry Christmas. Thanks. There's that look again. What look? The one you get every time you see a baby. Don't you think you should talk to John? We agreed we'd wait. You also agreed that you'd work out every day and only eat egg whites. Okay, that was unrealistic. Yeah! Are you really gonna wait another three years? 2.9 years. Okay. Did you get me a card? Maybe. It's so cute. "Merry Christmas to my best friend... who's always there, in good times and bad. And who always tells me the truth." And I always will. Me too. And right now the truth is I have something for you. What? We said no presents. It's not a present. It's an audition. I called my cousin. No. Day before Christmas. And since you were jilted, you're completely available. Mimi... no. No more excuses. I told you, I am out of practice. You have all week. What's the worst that could happen? Uh, I humiliate myself in front of the Heritage? And who hasn't done that once or twice? Change. Change. You're getting slow in your old age. So, blind date, huh? I thought you swore off those things. I got roped in. She's a bridesmaid at that wedding I'm shooting. Ah. What time? Coffee, 10:00. So, what, you'll be done at, uh... what, 10:05? I'm just saying. You haven't been in a real relationship in a while. And, uh, by "a while," I mean... years. Let's go, let's go! Well, maybe I'm waiting for the right one. Right one? How would you know? You never give anyone a chance. I gave someone a chance-- three years of my life. So you grew apart. It happens. She left me at the altar, Primo. Remember? Remind me again-- you still single? No, I'm not. I'm married to a restaurant. Remember? And we have a very good relationship! --Understood you. I loved you. How could you do this to me? - I loved you. - Leslie? Luke? Am I interrupting? No, I was just running lines. Phew. I have a really big audition later. - You're an actress? - Yeah. And you're a wedding photographer. Uh, more than just weddings. Headshots? Sometimes. Well, look at this... It's awful, right? No. I think you look great. But you could do better. I saw the proposal pictures. Amazing! Thank you. Maybe you could do my new headshots? Uh, sure. Yeah, uh... What can I get you? I'll have a latte, the Christmas Blend. That's a good choice. You know what? Make that two, please. Thank you. I love blind dates. Even if it's bad, something good can still come out of it, right? Uh, I've pretty much had the opposite experience. You on any dating apps? No! No, no, no, no. No. I like to think of myself as a man of fate. You mean, like, locking eyes across a crowded room? Something like that, yeah. Could you do me a big favor? Would you mind reading this with me before our drinks come? Oh, no, I'm not an actor. It's only one page. I'm just so nervous about this audition. Sure. You're Mike and I'm Claire. I'm Mike... "Mike." Okay. Uh... Claire, I can explain. How could you do this to me? I trusted you! I loved you! Uh-- It's not what you think. You make me sick! Do you want this to go? Yeah. "Dear Mrs. Miller-- Thank you for introducing me to the one lasting love of my life, music. Merry Christmas. Love Jessica." Excuse me. You dropped something. Thank you. Blitzen! Blitzen, come back here! Oh, I'm so sorry. It's all right. You can come in. Well, he's smart! He picked the best seat in the house. Blitzen... oh, boy. Blitzen, huh? You're a little small for a reindeer. How long have you had him? Oh, he's not mine. A friend of mine moved and couldn't take him with him, so I'm trying to find him his forever home. You know, I had a dog like you when I was growing up. You're very handsome. Well, thank you. I'm sorry. Just... I'm Tom. Lila. Pleasure. I'll get him some water. Can I get you a bowl of water, too? No, thank you. I had one earlier. I'm, um, gonna take an ad out after Christmas, but I haven't done a good photo yet. Is that even a dog? I know. He just wouldn't sit still. Blitzen, here's some water. Ah, "coffee for one." I got one of those last Christmas from my daughter. Mine's from my niece. Apparently, they don't think we can handle caffeine anymore. Who do they think they are? Even if they're right. So, do you live nearby? I'm over on Maple. Those new condos. I moved in after my wife passed. Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. When did she pass? Around three years now. My husband passed two years ago. I'm sorry, too, Lila. Well... it's been a pleasure meeting you. You too, Tom. Happy holidays. We will, um... We'll let ourselves out. - Come on. - Bye, Blitzen! I've got this for Private Winthrop. Merry Christmas, Jess. Let's see what we have for you today. Hey. You again. You, uh, come here often? Every day. Right. Yeah. Uh, me too. Um... Got any plans for the holidays? Waiting for my orders. I'm heading to Germany. Did you know that gingerbread is from Germany? Yeah, they call it, uh... lebkuchenplaetzchen. Anything for Private Angie Dawson? Let me have a look here. No, sorry, Angie. Maybe try again tomorrow. Hey! Look. - I wanted to apologize. - For what? Being a complete idiot around you. Normally, I am extremely charming. - Really? - Okay, I'm somewhat charming. Cute card. Ah, yes, the snowman-- perfect guy. Well-rounded and not afraid to carry a broom. - Who's it from? - My sister. She's pretty amazing. You must be close. Yeah, she's kind of been my rock-solid. Are you okay? Yeah. It's just my first Christmas away from home. Mine too. You're lucky to have family like that. Your social media manager says you should post three times a day. I have a social media manager? Yeah. Me. Whatever that is, I don't want it. What's that? It's from a fan. You mean a follower? No. I don't mean a follower. Well, what's it say? I was "the soundtrack" of her life. She says my music helped her get through the loss of her parents. Your music helped me get through a tough time, too. You never told me that. Should've. Merry Christmas, Daisy. Who's next? Billy... Oh, you're getting so big, Billy. Now, tell me, what do you want for Christmas? A giant Christmas tree! A giant Christmas tree, huh? Let me see what I can do. Deal? Deal. All right. Say "cheese." I've got pepper spray. Jessica Winthrop? Santa? Right... Uh, I'm coming from somewhere. The North Pole? North Side. Uh... You sent this to my mother. Your mother is Mrs. Miller? I usually just call her "Mom." She's in Kenya for a year, teaching. Oh, that is so wonderful! It must seem crazy, me writing to her, since I haven't seen her since I was 10. Why don't you come in? You know, I don't think sending a card is crazy at all. She did introduce you to the one lasting love of your life... You read it? Okay, in my defense, she asked me to open her mail. I read it to her over the phone. Apparently, you were my mother's most promising student. She remembered me? Even your nickname. Mm. "Messy Jessie." Should I ask? Nope. You should not. Anyway, I just thought you should know. It really touched her. Like what she did mattered, you know? - Okay! - Sorry. Let me give you a hand. Oh! Ow! Uh... I'm so sorry. That was my fault. I have a really hard head. You really do! Looks like you still play. Oh, uh... a little. I own, um, "Strings & Notes" on Wabash. - By the donut shop? - Yeah. Yeah, I've seen it. I've never been in. I'm not musically inclined. But your mom is a music teacher. Yeah, she made the mistake one Christmas of giving me a camera. That was it for me. Mm. - There you go. - Ahem. Thanks. It was a recital... In my Mom's living room. Where I first saw you. You were that girl hiding behind your cello. Anyway, uh... your apple. Thank you. It was great seeing you again, Jessica. You as well, Mrs. Miller's son. That's right. Call me Luke. Luke. Donut? No Santa pants? Clashed with my shirt. Nice place. Thanks. You probably wonder what I'm doing here. Yeah. Kinda. Oh... it's beautiful. May I? Please. Is this your mother's? One of her favorites. Wow. You're not selling it, are you? No. Actually... She has instructed me to give it to you. What? Christmas present. No. No, no, no, no. I-I-- I couldn't-- She insists. You can check the 15 emails she sent me, if you don't believe me. But all I did was send her a card. Well... that card brought me here. Wow. Okay, then, well, I should probably confess that I originally bought that card for my ex-boyfriend, but he dumped me before I could send it. - Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. Ouch. - No, no, no. I shouldn't be laughing. It's okay, it's all right. I actually bought five of 'em, so I sent them to the most important people in my life, so it actually turned out kind of perfectly. I'm not trying to be nosy, but who were the other four? My best friend, my brother, my aunt, and a guy in a boy band. Boy band? Mm-hmm. Jax. - Ohh... - Okay! Before you judge me... His music got me through a really tough time. Whatever you say. Just take the cello. How do I thank her? Well... I guess you can start by playing it. Don't stop. That was... beautiful. Thank you. She's auditioning for the Heritage. That's incredible. It's a long shot. Not from what I just heard. It was the cello, believe me. I've heard that cello before, and it has never sounded like that. But if you ever tell Mrs. Miller that, I will totally deny it. Mm-mm. Mum's the word. Uh... hi. Anyway... good luck. Thank you. You too. I mean... Merry Christmas. Oh! Uh... One more thing. Who did the tree? Jessica. You don't, by chance, have a free hour after work, do you? She can go right now. This place practically runs itself! You know, I-I'm actually taking a break from dating for a while, so... Okay. That's great. But, actually, I'm wondering if you could help me pick out a tree and ornaments, and whatever you did there. Oh. She'd love to. - Yeah? - Sure. Well, hello, you two. He pulled me the whole way here. Any luck finding his forever home? No. Not yet. Blitzen. Don't worry, boy. Well, maybe if you groom him and take a new photo. Yeah, dog grooming is not really my wheelhouse, but I'm game. I have some Christmas decorations in the house. We could spruce him up if you want to take a picture. Yeah! Yeah, let's. What do you say then? Blitzen! Come on. Let's clean you up. Your niece sounds great. She is. And Carter is in the military. Oh, you must be very proud. I am. Their parents died when he was a baby, but Jessica was 13... hit her really hard. And over the years, she's stopped taking chances. I can understand that. Let's put a bow in your hair! On behalf of dogs everywhere, let's not, especially if I'm gonna be walking him. Okay, just on his collar then. Oh, boy... Beautiful. Yeah. Hey, let's take one with all three of us? Okay. Oh! Oh, that's great. You know... He can stay with me until you find him a forever home. Are you sure? That could be a while. I'm sure. Hey. You okay? Because I practically cried over a Christmas card? I'm fine. - Just checking. - Thanks. I guess your card just reminded me that my family's... Actually, it's just two of us. Me and my Mom. She stopped talking to me when I enlisted. I'm sorry. She's afraid something will happen to me. She can't understand this is what I want. Guess it can be hard for some people. Yeah. Plus, Christmas and all, you know, it's a time people get homesick. Even when you're home. Where's home? Florida. Oh! Yeah, all the sun and oranges, that must be brutal. Can't build a snowman with orange peels. What? You've never built a snowman? No. You? From Chicago. We build, like, three a day. Come on. ♪ My way ♪ Find my way... ♪ Back home Yeah, I like that. That's good, that's good, that's good. You're up early. I'm writing. On a napkin? I wrote "Luv U On Christmas" on a paper towel. Speaking of which, shouldn't you be rehearsing? I'm gonna be doing a new song. Oh, pretty sure they don't want a new one. Convince them. Jax. Do you remember the band's first gig? Christmas Eve at that little dive near the El tracks? Remember? Yeah. I had to give the club owner my watch just to get you that spot. All of us together-- that was real music. Yeah. I gotta find that feeling again. Okay. ♪ Woke up Two weeks before Christmas ♪ ♪ Singing The same old song ♪ "Three weeks before Christmas"? Two weeks before Christmas. Ah. Norway Spruce-- it's pretty, but it drops needles kind of quickly. Good to know. Noble fir. Holds heavy ornaments. Hmm! Are you an arborist? No, I'm just someone who overdoes Christmas. Or at least I used to. I'm trying to cut down a little bit. Pretty sure there are worse habits. Christmas is about love. You can never have too much love, right? Where'd you hear that? - Wedding vows. - You married? No! No, I just go to a lot of weddings. I'm the guy behind the camera saying "Cheese." Yeah, I used to think I was gonna change the world with my photos. Turns out, that doesn't pay the bills, so... wedding dresses and "I Do's." Oh. You're giving people memories. That's true. Ah! Christmas fir-- the king of Christmas. Great needle retention and the best smell. Sold! It's a little big, don't you think? Nope. Do you live in a department store? Rockefeller Center. Ah! Perfect then. Now we just need a couple hundred feet of lights and 50 pounds of tinsel, we'll be good to go. Great. You skate? Uh... hockey. You? Figure-eights. Oh... You know, we play every Wednesday and Friday night at Lincoln Park rink, if you ever want to join us. - But I-- - Not a date. Just a... skate. - Oh... - No! It's a classic! So is "The Chipmunk Song." Oh, and I like that one, too! - Oh! - Uh-huh. "Grandma Got Run Over By a Reindeer"? On my top-10 list. Ohh! And you call yourself a music aficionado? Hey you mind if we drop this enormous Sequoia off on our way? I'm just not sure I'm man enough to carry it on my own. So, what, you give me one priceless cello and, all of a sudden, I'm your personal holiday assistant? Santa needs his Mrs. Claus. Technically, her name is Mrs. Kringle. And I suppose you know her first name, too. Oh, I do. It's actually "Jessica." Please tell me you were not named after Mrs. Kringle. No, I was not. "Jessica and Kris Kringle." It's got a ring to it. Yes. It does. We're here. I thought the tree was for you. No. I already have a tree. Is it Primo's? Please tell me this isn't some sort of "proposal tree." What? No. St. Mary's. Oh! Oh, that's so nice. I'm kind of attached to the place. Oh, you know someone there? Uh, yeah, just about everyone. I volunteer there a lot. Actually spent a few years there myself way back when, until Mrs. Miller found me. Oh. Yeah. You want a hat? I've got an extra. - Why not? - All right! Oh! So sorry. No worries. Wow, these are beautiful. Thank you. Oh! Wow. Keep it. What? No. I... "You want the moon? Just say the word, I'll throw a lasso around it, and I'll pull it down." Now come on. Grab the end of this tree. Santa! Santa! Ladies and gentlemen... Santa has entered the building! Ho, ho, ho! You remembered? Of course I remembered. Now, how could I forget you, hmm? And you and you... and you and you and you? And I'm going to help you decorate this tree, right after I take "Mrs. Kringle" here back to the North Pole. Now, wait a second, Santa. Do you remember what happened the last time I left the decorations up to you? Not off-hand. Well, let's just say it ended with a tipped-over tree and an electrical shortage. Oh, ho! Ho, ho, ho. Oh! It's all coming back to me now. Yeah. Ho, ho, ho. Well, Mrs. Kringle here listens to boy bands. Uh-huh! Well, did you know that Santa eats donuts for breakfast? - Mm! - Uh-huh. Who doesn't? Oh, ho, ho, ho! Ho, ho, ho... You're back! I got some things for Blitzen. Oh! Thank you. A '72 Scamp! She is beautiful! It's my husband's. The "Lug Nut" was crazy about this car. Must have taken it apart and put it back together 20 times. When was the last time you drove it? I haven't. He wanted me to, but I'll probably just sell it now. You know, cars are like us. It's not good for them to sit around. Have you finished your Christmas shopping yet? Actually, I haven't started. Neither have I. Ahem. You requisitioned a car for your supply run? That doesn't look regulation, Rudolph. You get your orders yet? No. Hopefully somewhere with snow. You really like snow. I've spent a lot of years hearing about these "white Christmases." Hang on. Electrical short. I got this. Just need to wait till the engine cools. You know... there's something I've been wanting to do. Okay. Make a snowman. Oh! What'd you think I was going to say? That's absolutely what I thought you were gonna say. Come on. When I was little, my mom and I used to make little snowmen with mashed potatoes. We'd use olives for eyes and a little carrot nose. Mashed potato snowmen... that's quite the tradition. I'd forgotten about it... until now. What are you doing with that? No, no. No. No! You'll be missing Florida. Okay... what is it? Uh... The gig fell through. Ahh. What, did the 12-year-old lose all his followers? No, no, he's still playing. You're just not opening for him. I told them that you wanted to play a new song, and they said no. So... I said no. You said no to a paying gig? Yeah. Well, like somebody said, it's... it's about the music. You're not mad, are you? Mad? Look... Thank you for believing in me. I've always believed in you. You're my brother. Hey, so, uh, let's hear that song. Yeah, it's a-- it's a Christmas song. Yeah, that's a good start. I've had this tune stuck in my head all week. Check it out. It's good, right? No... Relax! Relax. I've got this. I know you do. You know what I don't have, though? A band. I'll call the boys! No. I'll do it. I'll call Tim and Perry. The beginning of my "Apology Tour." Thanks, bro. ♪ ...One-horse open sleigh Hey! ♪ ♪ Jingle bells, jingle bells ♪ Jingle all the way ♪ Oh, what fun it is to ride In a one-horse open sleigh ♪ ♪ Oh! Wow, we were there for six hours. Yeah, that's like... six first dates. If this were a date, which it's not. Your dates only last an hour? About five minutes, tops. I spend the rest of my hour just being polite. Five minutes? Oh, come on, you know in the first five minutes, right? No. You're telling me it takes you three years to figure out if it's gonna work with somebody? Huh? Mm, I can't say, because I've never been in a three-year relationship. Mine usually end around the three-month point. - Three months? - Mm-hmm. It's like a 90-day warranty? Five minutes? Like the grace period in a parking lot? So who's more messed up, you or me? I'm gonna go with you. Then again, I'm alone, too, so I can't really talk. Touche. Oh, no! That's him. That's him. Who? Mm. The guy that just dumped me. - The fake doctor guy? - Yeah. I don't want to see him. Taller than I thought. Here. Ahem. What are you doing? You don't have to see him... but he can see you. Holding hands with Santa? Works for me. Or how about... Jessica kissing Kris Kringle? That works for me, too. Okay, but let's just be clear, this is not real. No. Fake kiss. Fake doctor, fake Santa. I got it. Did he see? Who cares? I-- uh, I'm-I'm gonna go... I'm gonna-- I'm gonna take a cab now-- - No. - ...And go. - I'll take you. - No. It's no problem. No. But thank you. Goodnight. You've never sounded better. And don't say it's the cello. It's you. I don't want to make an idiot of myself at the audition. You won't. I might. So? What if you do? It's the Heritage! I'm sure they've seen plenty of hacks before. Oh, that makes me feel so much better! Thank you. And I feel better, knowing you haven't given up... on romance and Christmas. Mimi. You bought a tree together, you decorated it, you went caroling... and... he gave you a cello, all in less than 24 hours. Not to mention, I like him. You don't even know him. I know he wears Santa pants. I told you that? By the way, your last boyfriend ironed his jeans. You know way too much information. Just tell me that you're gonna see him again. I don't know. I don't know. Well, how was it left? Did he ask you out? Did he shake your hand? You kissed! Okay. It wasn't real. Wes was there, that's why it happened-- it was purely tactical. What does that even mean? You know, I don't care. Who kissed who? I don't remember. Did he move in first, or did you? Well? What do you remember? Nothing. We kissed and... I forget the rest. That is so romantic. Oh! Hey, Ruth. Hey, Joshua. We were wondering if Joshua could switch to the guitar. Of course you can. You owe me dinner. Oh! That looks so cool. What a beautiful picture. Oh, yeah, it's the, um, it's the kids at St. Mary's. St. Mary's... that's downtown, right? Yeah. Uh, the photographer who took it, Luke Miller, he spends a lot of time with the kids down there. Does he have a website? Yeah, I think so. ♪ Woke up Two weeks before Christmas ♪ ♪ Singing the same old song ♪ Finding my way Through the season ♪ ♪ Four calling birds Three French hens ♪ ♪ Two turtle doves ♪ And a partridge ♪ In a pear tree How are you? - Good to see you, man. - Long time, brother. How long has it been? Nine years, two album flops, and a partridge in a pear tree. Oh, what a dump. I live in two rooms, I don't know what the rest are for. Remember our old apartment? One room for all of us. Taking turns sleeping in the hallway. Standing up! I don't even remember why we broke up. Uh, you wanted to go solo. Uh, didn't work out so well. Yeah, we know. We-- We know. Look, I'm sorry, guys. I don't... I was stupid. And selfish and... Young. Mm-hmm. We all were. We've all made mistakes. I'm just really glad you called. Me too. Me three. So, what's this I hear about a new Christmas song? I don't know if you guys are ready, but follow me. All right! Got it. Perfect. So? I heard you went out with Leslie? Uh, kind of. It was sweet of you to offer to take her headshots. - I did? - Hi, Luke! So, I was thinking. I brought a change of wardrobe. Maybe we could do some shots right now? Uh... The thing is, I have a hockey thing. It's my annual Christmas game. I'm already running late. - I love hockey. - She does! Okay. Now, Blitzen, this is my famous fruitcake. You may think you want some, but you don't, trust me. Let's get you your kibble for one. You're such a good boy. That's where that went! Oh! "Dear Aunt Lila, it wouldn't be Christmas without you, and I wouldn't be the person I am today..." "...if you and Uncle CJ hadn't been there for me." "You taught me to be kind, to be strong, and to always believe in myself." "I'm lucky. I'm blessed. Thank you." "Love Jessica." Hey-- Are you crying? I just read your Christmas card... and I wanted to thank you. Being in your life and Carter's life has been the greatest joy of my life. Oh! Now you're gonna make me cry! Are you watching a dog movie? No, I'm watching a real dog. Blitzen, this is Jessica. Aw! That's so sweet! He's with me until he gets adopted. But, honey, how are you? Are you getting out? Just because some fake doctor did you a favor and broke up with you doesn't mean you need to be sitting around. I'm not. Oh. Time for a walk. Love you! Mwah! Love you. Mwah. Bye. That's good. Like it. Chin up? There we go. Sorry to interrupt. Uh... We're, uh, we're dropping the puck. Uh, oh, uh, Leslie, Primo. - Primo, Leslie. - Hey. You did that toothpaste commercial! Yeah! You saw that? Saw it? Yeah! I even bought some. See? It works. You didn't tell me you were working with a celebrity. Look at this. - Stop. - Keeping secrets! You're coming, right? Yeah, give me a minute. You good? Can we just take one of me skating? It's the last one. I promise. I'll be there in a minute. Yeah, take your time. All right. Ready? Yeah. Okay! Whoa... You okay? They were ice skating together and she was gorgeous. Not more gorgeous than you. John, tell her she's more gorgeous than the ice skater. I'd have to see the ice skater. Of course you are. Plus, she could be his sister. Or his mother. Mm, definitely wasn't his mother. Grandmother? People don't skate with their grandmothers, Mimi. The point is, it's not gonna work out. Anyway, what was so important that you guys had to bring me here so early? This. What? You said, "my friend who always tells me the truth." Well, John read it and it turns out, we haven't been exactly honest with each other. You haven't? We made some promises when we got married, but things changed, and we were afraid to tell each other. But your card got us talking and... ...We made a decision. Oh, no. We're not waiting 2.9 years. What? We want to have a baby. A.S.A.P.! You guys are gonna be the best parents! And you're gonna be the best godmother. She can call me Auntie Jess. Unless it's a he. I'll teach him how to play the cello. Isn't that kind of big for a baby? He won't have time. He's playing football. Okay. Good morning. Hey, you two. You ready to walk? Let me get his leash. I couldn't resist. A Christmas leash. Well, we all could use a new "leash on life," right? Something smells good in here. Fruitcake. The famous fruitcake is a doorstop? Yep. Do I get to try it? Oh, we don't eat it. It's famous for being hard as a rock. It's a family tradition. Oh, Lila. I've got some news. Um... Someone I know, she and her husband are looking for a dog. I showed them a picture of Blitzen and they'd like to meet him. Oh. That's great. You okay? Of course. A forever home. I said that we'd bring him by tomorrow, if that's all right. Sure. Well, Blitzen, we should take an extra-long walk, shall we? After you. Jax, Tim, and Perry, it's three days before Christmas and you're all in the same room. So I'm gonna ask what the fans what to know. Are we talking reunion? Maybe! Yeah! I mean, we were friends before we were a band, so that's really the most important thing. Come on, Jax. More important than the music? Yeah! Yeah. It's what Christmas is all about. Being together with the people you love. All right, I feel that, I feel that. Now, last time you guys were in town, you played Horizon Center, right? Yes, we were! Great show, right? And the first time we played here was for about 20 people, half of whom were our parents. That's what I like to call a nice, cozy audience. - Nice way to put it! So where's it gonna be this time? Trying to get that exclusive. What do you think we're all doing here, man? Too easy! How much fun would that be? You heard it here first! Jax and his boys are back. You know the music, you know the band-- you love them both. I want to wish you guys a merry Christmas. Merry Christmas, guys! Hello, Luke. I write for the South Shore Daily newspaper. Jessica at Strings & Notes showed me your photo of St. Mary's. Could we talk? Thank you. Ruth Smith. Look who's having a pop-up concert. Oh, wow. I haven't seen Jax in concert since I was 14. And now you have your braces off. Yes, I do. Oh, no. Jerk alert. I'll get rid of him. No. I got this. I'll be in the back, sharpening a drumstick. So... how are you? I'm good. Thanks. You left this in my car. How thoughtful of you. Look, I really... I just wanted to talk to you in person. I was insensitive. I can think of another word. I got scared. All the holidays and family stuff and the traditions... I never had that, and it kind of freaked me out. It wasn't all you. I knew things weren't right between us. I just-- I couldn't admit it then, but you were right. Maybe I wasn't. Look, could we just forget the last few days and try again? Oh. Actually, I... I can't. What, because of that guy you were kissing? You saw that? That turned out to be a mistake, too. Sorry. No, it's okay. I'm actually taking a holiday from dating. And you know me and my holidays. Well... if you ever need glasses... Ex-girlfriend discount? Always. Merry Christmas, Jessica. Merry Christmas. Bye. If you're here to try to change her mind, I wouldn't bother. "...And this is my journey to becoming a foster parent. One I've been wanting to take for a very long time." This story's so good, I want to cry. Yeah. In fact, everything makes me want to cry. Come on, Mimi. Did you call him? No. - Just call him. - Mimi. But I had such a good feeling about him! Look, if it was meant to be, it would've been, right? Now, you two get outta here. We said no presents. We say a lot of things. Merry Christmas. Call us the second your audition's over. I will. Mm! Merry Christmas, Jess. Mimi, honey, we really gotta hit the road. Wait, wait, wait. One last thing. Ta-dah! Nice touch. - Merry Christmas, you two! - Merry Christmas. Mm. Love you. Drive safely! Okay, look. You've been doing this forever, right? Is there any way you can play this by yourself and I promise I will make it worth your while? New strings, new case, you name it. Thank you. Next cellist. Okay. My name is Jessica Winthrop and I've been avoiding this moment for way too long, but it's Christmas and this is my gift to myself. We're hoping it's your gift to us as well. Whenever you're ready. Right. Ahem. You put it on the mantle? Text me a picture. I miss you, too, Mom. Merry Christmas, Lug Nut! Merry, merry, Messy Jessie! How are you? I'm great. I got your card. I want you to know it meant a lot to me. I am so proud of you and I just-- I want you to be safe. Thanks, sis. I am. Hey, um, this is gonna sound weird, but your card kind of set off a chain of events for me. There was someone I wanted to get to know here and your card got us talking, so I wonder if I could cross a few things off and give it to her? Absolutely. Who is she? A private. And it's private. - Oh! - For now. Everything good at home? You are looking at the new substitute second chair of the Chicago Heritage Orchestra. Jess! That's amazing! When you come back, you'll come see me play, yeah? I can't wait. Okay, I love you. Merry Christmas! Mwah! This is it. Looks nice. And it's close by, so if they're walking him, we might see him. Yeah. Blitzen... I want you to have a happy life. But if you don't like them, you tell me, and we'll go right home. - Home. - What? Well, you said "home." Well, he knows what I meant. Yeah. Yeah, I think he does. I can't do this. I won't do this. He's found his forever home. With me. I was hoping you would say that. Really? Yeah. Come on, let's get outta here before they see us. Just-- Just call her. Let it go, Primo. It wasn't meant to be. All right. Are you sure? 'Cause it lasted a lot longer than five minutes. I get it. You're scared. It's okay. Of what? Of "what if she's the one?" You're going to have to stop hiding behind that camera of yours. You've spent so much time taking pictures of other people's lives. How about you start living your own? Come on. Let's go. Ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - Santa! Your picture made a story, and the story made people find us! Really? I love you, Santa. Oh, I love you, too, buddy. Merry Christmas, Santa. I wanted to come over and thank you. I'm Ruth Smith. Merry Christmas, Ruth. I'm glad you came. Seeing your photo with all those sweet faces made me realize... what am I waiting for? I'm glad to hear that. I know how much it means to these children. I don't think I've ever had a happier Christmas. Hey! Come and get it! Christmas pizza for everyone! Oh! Red and green peppers. Santa? Isn't Mrs. Kringle with you? Well, uh... ahem. Mrs. Kringle had to go back to the North Pole. When? Last night. But she was here this morning. She was? She brought us presents. Flutes. I opened one, but I rewrapped it. Oh. Shh. I won't tell. Go on. Go get some food. Okay. Can I have a piece of cheese pizza? I'll give you the moon, Mary. I'll take it! Then what? Well, then you could swallow it and it'd all dissolve, see? And the moonbeams would shoot out of your fingers and your toes and the ends of your hair. Am I talking too much? Yes! Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? How's that? Why don't you kiss her instead of talking her to death? You want me to kiss her, huh? Ah, youth is wasted on the wrong people! Merry Christmas. Grand fir. Strong. Unique. Perfect. Hey! I got something for you. You redacted your Christmas card. Got permission from the higher-ups. "Dear Private Dawson..." "I don't know when we'll see each other again or what the future will bring, but we have today, and we'll always have our snowman... even when he melts." Are you trying to make me cry again? Just the opposite. I have something for you, too. My orders. What was that word for gingerbread again? Leb-kitchen-platsen? Close enough. We might be spending a lot of holidays together. I think I'm okay with that. Me too. Merry Christmas, Angie. Merry Christmas, Carter. Ahem. Those are for you. Merry Christmas Eve! Hi, Aunt Lila! Jessica! Oh! - Hey! - Oh! What a beautiful tree. Trees are our thing, right? They are! I heard from Carter. Me too! You got the door? Yep. And guess what-- I think he has a girlfriend. He told you? He tells me everything. We'll set it here, and then you can help me with the yams. You get the marshmallows? Of course. Oh! Is this Blitzen? Welcome to the family, buddy. I have you to thank. Me? He came to the mailbox when I went to get your Christmas card. Oh! And that's Tom. He also came to the mailbox. I am so glad I sent you that card. I am, too. Merry Christmas! - Merry Christmas! - You must be Jessica. I am. It's such a pleasure to finally meet you. Thank you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. ♪ O come, all ye faithful ♪ Joyful and triumphant - Excuse me one second? - Of course. I'm just going to go check on Luke. - I'll save you a dance. - You going to be okay? - Hey! - Hey. Buddy, you all right? Yeah, man. Think I'm gonna take off. No! No. Stay. Stay a little longer. No, it's a great party, man, really, it is, but it is time for this "third wheel" to roll. Come on, man. Love you, buddy. I love you, too, Luke. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. Good luck. ♪ O come let us adore Him... Uh-uh-uh-uh! You cook, I clean. That's our deal. It's not necessary. - Yep. - You cook? Hey, Mimi! You're on speaker! Hey, you're not gonna believe it.

Look at you beautiful people! Sorry, sorry. Excuse me, excuse me. - Hi. I need to get in there. - Too late. You can listen out here. Oh, no. No, no. Please. It's not about the music. You see, I don't like his music. And that's supposed to get you in? Uh... What if I told you I think there's a woman in there that I'm meant to be with? That's better. - But it's still a no. - Come on, man. It's Christmas. Merry Christmas. Thanks. Anyway, I got a lot to be thankful for. Um, my brother and manager, Todd, who's stuck with me through the good times and the not-so-good times. You know what? Todd, come out here. Come on, man. This guy right here. I would not be here without you, brother. Yeah, don't I know it. And my oldest friends-- Perry and Tim-- who have been the backbone of this band, and who have remained patient while I... ...the magic that brought us here tonight. They have never lost the talent and purpose that began in my basement. We were just dumb kids when we first got up here and... I-I got off-track a little bit, but we found our way back here, right, guys? Okay. And tonight, we're gonna play a new song. This goes out to a very special lady named Jessica.
