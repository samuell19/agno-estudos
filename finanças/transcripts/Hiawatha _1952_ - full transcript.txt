(male narrator) Should you ask me, whence these stories? Whence these legends and traditions with the odors of the forest with the dew and damp of meadows with the curling smoke of wigwams with the rushing of great rivers with their frequent repetitions and their wild reverberations as of thunder in the mountains? I should answer, I should tell you from the forests and the prairies from the great lakes of the Northland from the land of the Ojibwes, from the land of the Dakotas there they sang of Hiawatha. Sang the song of Hiawatha. Sang his wondrous birth and being. How he prayed and how he fasted. How he lived and toiled and suffered that the tribes of men might prosper. That he might advance his people. Hiawatha, we found tracks already. Look at these. Deer tracks not more than two hours old. There'll be fresh venison in our lodges tonight. Not a very large one from the size of the hoofmark. Good. Then, he will be more tender. Here's another set, these are bigger. - Here are more. - It's a whole family of deer. Let's spread out. They're Illinois. Maybe a war party. They're Illinois alright, but they're not painted for war. They're just a peaceful hunting party like us. What are they doing in our territory? Maybe they're lost. What are you going to do? - Talk to them. - Be careful. They're Illinois. [dramatic music] Pau PukKeewis! You fool. They were willing to be friends. They're friends no longer. Put them to flight. Follow them. Wait. Step aside. Are you mad? Going into their territory? He's right. There are too few of us. Fine warriors all of you. We did not come here as warriors. We came here to hunt. And that's what they were doing until you lost your head. Lost my head? I saved your life. 'That Illinois was reaching for an arrow--' He was not. He was unslinging his quiver as I did so we could talk. An Illinois? Our enemy for years wanting to talk instead of kill? It's only a flesh wound. Can you make it with Kwasind's help or shall we build you a litter? I'll be alright. We better return to the village. If there were any deer nearby, they are long gone by now. We'll take the deer they killed. At least, we'll have something to show for our trip. And then the enemy turned and fled before our arrows. We did not follow them because we did not want to enter their territory. You acted wisely, Pau PukKeewis. He acted wisely! If we had listened to him, we'd still be pursuing them. Tell them, Hiawatha. Never mind, Chibiabos. Listen. My brothers, obviously the Illinois are planning another war against us. 'Scouting party so close to our borders can mean only one thing' they're looking for the best approach to our village. I say let us strike first. Before they can organize an attack against our people. I would speak, Megissogwon. The group of Illinois we encountered today was not a scouting party. They were hunting just as we were. The deer Pau PukKeewis brought was shot by them, not us. 'You saw the Illinois arrow in its breast.' (Megissogwon) 'If they were hunters, why did they attack?' I went to talk to their leader. He reached up to remove his quiver, and Pau PukKeewis 'thinking he meant harm, killed him.' That's how it started. Perhaps he saved my life. If so, I'm very grateful. Regardless of whether our young braves encountered a scouting party or merely a group of hunters we have learned one thing my brothers we have learned that shutting ourselves from our neighbors for so long has not been wise. I would speak, Megissogwon. My brothers, Megissogwon has put into words a fear that has long been in my own heart. That because our war drums have remained silent for so many moons we grow complacent and soft. While our enemies, the Illinois and the Dakotas make plans for war. We have no proof of this. Nor do we have assurance that it is not so. I would speak, Megissogwon. Fear of our neighbors or of things unknown and strange is understandable. There is but one way to conquer such doubts and fears. Through knowledge. I propose that we send our bravest young men to explore and scout the Illinois and the Dakota territories. I agree with Iagoo. We grow old, we Ojibwe chiefs and the young men who will succeed us how many of them have been outside our own tribal boundaries? [indistinct chattering] It is agreed then that the exploration as Iagoo wisely suggests will be undertaken immediately. [whispering indistinctly] For leader of an expedition into the land of our enemies the Illinois, we have selected Pau PukKeewis. 'And to accompany him, Chunung...and Hiawatha.' Are there any in the council who disapprove of this selection? Wait. - 'You object, Pau PukKeewis?' - I do. Since I have been selected to lead this party I must have full confidence in my men. 'Therefore, I ask for another in place of Hiawatha.' What is your reason, Pau PukKeewis? He isn't experienced in battle. I prefer Neyadji whose deeds I know and is of pure Ojibwe blood. [indistinct chattering] We are all Ojibwe here, my son. 'However, since you will be leader of the mission' 'it is right you be granted your choice of men.' Wait, Hiawatha. With the approval of the council I select you to lead a scouting party into the territory of the Dakotas. I need not ask if you're willing, my son. 'You may chose two companions.' I select Chibiabos and Kwasind. Pau PukKeewis, I wish to speak with you. Yes. I demand to know the meaning of the word you spoke in council? Demand is a strong word from one who claims to be so peaceful. What did you mean by pure Ojibwe blood? I was speaking of my friend, Neyadji. - I know, but you meant me. - Yes. That's exactly who I meant. - I'm warning you Pau-- - It is I who warn you. I say what I believe. If you think that you can stop me, you're free to try any place, any time. What is troubling you, Pau PukKeewis? What is the cause of this hatred you bear me? We have never seen things through the same eyes, Hiawatha. We never will. We will fight one day, Pau PukKeewis. I will be ready. I still would like to know what Pau PukKeewis meant by pure Ojibwe blood. He said it, and in open council too. Strange. Everybody seemed to know what he meant by it but nothing more was said about it. Grandmother, what did he mean? It grows late. You should rest for your journey tomorrow. Nokomis, I must know. I had hoped that time would erase certain memories but it has not. Yes, grandson.. ...I think the time has come when you should know. Wenonah, who was your mother and my daughter was the most beautiful and gentlest of our tribe. She could've chosen any young man for her husband any brave in the village. But there came into our midst a stranger from another tribe. And when she saw him Wenonah became as one bewitched. She married him. Were they happy? They seemed but to live and breathe for one another until a messenger from his tribe came one day to say that his father had died and he was now chief. He left Wenonah. Who was then carrying you and could not travel easily. He promised to return for her. Wenonah waited.. ...and waited. He never returned. Day and night, she yearned for him until finally she died of grief. He killed her. As if he'd done it with his own hands. Who is my father? Tell me. I'll find him and destroy him. I've often dreamed of such. Wenonah's son growing up to avenge her death. Tell me who is he? No. You might be killed, and this I could not have. Tell me where is he. He lives in a distant land. Forget your thoughts of vengeance. It is better now to prove yourself worthy of being called an Ojibwe. Be careful. I will not be with you this time to protect you. [instrumental music] You know, I don't think we will find much excitement. Don't be too sure. We still have a lot of ground to cover. Speaking of that, I think.. It's a Dakota. No, Kwasind. It's just a peaceful hunter. The Illinois planned a war against us. Why kill a Dakota and stir up more trouble? As I started to say before instead of traveling together we should separate and cover three times as much ground 'and we can meet here two dawns from now.' - You mean each one of us alone? - Why not? Are you afraid? There's nothing here, but Dakotas. They would only cut your throat. There are other things around here besides Dakotas. If you would use your eyes more instead of your mouth you would've seen the bear tracks. We will draw to decide our directions. The longest goes north the shortest, south and the next, west. - North. - South West. Remember. Two dawns from now. Here. [dramatic music] [growling] [growling] [growling] Father, what has happened? Who is he? 'An Ojibwe brave. A bear attacked him.' Ojibwe, our enemies. - We must send word. - First, we tend his wounds. Get ointments. Start making poultices. Bring water. Help me carry him inside. He's sleeping soundly. - His head feels cool. - He's a spy. Sooner you send word to Mudjekeewis of his capture. the safer Iwill feel. Perhaps he wandered into our lands accidently. We have no proof of his spying. That's for Mudjekeewis and his council to decide, not us. You know what would happen if we sent word to the chiefs. He'd be put to death. Seems wrong somehow. 'He's already been so close to death' and he's very young. And may be very evil. [water splashing] Oh! You're awake. What is this place? Who brought me here? You're a prisoner captured by my father. Your father? Where is your father? Lie still and open your mouth. - I'm not hungry. - Eat! [coughs] But I'm really not very hung-- Father said if you woke up, you were to be fed. I went through trouble to make this and now you're going to eat it. It's really very good. Father, he's waking up. You feeling better? Yes. You and your daughter have been very good to me. Your wounds heal quickly. You're healthy and strong but nobody is strong enough to wrestle a bear that size. The wrestling was not my idea. I owe you my life. I suppose that's true. 'You were unwise to hunt so far from your own lands.' 'My daughter believes that you were not hunting at all.' She thinks you're a spy. Your daughter's right. I am a spy. I see. Then your people are planning war upon the Dakotas? No. My mission was to learn what preparations for war you were making against us. And what did you learn? Not very much. I saw one Dakota hunter and one bear. That's as far as I got. What is your name? Hiawatha. I am Lakku, the arrow maker. Hiawatha, if I were to tell you we make no plans for war would you believe me? Yes. I would. Then, should you be allowed to return to your own people what would you tell them? I would tell them how Lakku, maker of arrows rescued me from certain death and how he and his lovely daughter cared for my wounds. And I'd tell them it would be impossible for people like that to want war. You think he speaks the truth, my daughter? He talks with a fast tongue but then captive spies always do. You, of course, have listened to a great many captive spies so you know what you're talking about. Alright. Do whatever you want with him but don't be surprised if he tells a completely different story when he gets home. What else could he tell? Why do you keep asking me questions? Who's the spy? He or I? You will learn if you haven't already that women, even when they know they're wrong seldom admit it. My daughter is no exception. It's a beautiful day. - It is. - 'Really a wonderful day.' There's just enough breeze to make it pleasant. You know, I think this is the most beautiful time of year and you're the most beautiful girl I've ever seen. Looks like this has been washed a little too long in one place Let us hope it is not going to be a cold winter. It's your fault. You should be inside recovering from your wounds instead of annoying busy women. You're not that busy. Talk to me for a while. That is unless you're still afraid of me. Hiawatha, are the other Ojibwe people like you? Of course. Why? I've always thought your people to be fierce and very evil. And for as long as I can remember I thought the same of the Dakotas. I know better now. I do too. I'm glad. Coming here and meeting you has been the most wonderful thing that ever happened to me. I wish I could find words to tell you. Please. Don't try. But we're friends now, you and I. I find that being friends with you isn't enough. I love you. No, you're just grateful to me for what I've done. You haven't known me long enough. Besides, I'm betrothed. Oh, who is he? His name is Ogeema. He's a very brave and kind man. I'm sure he is. Please ask your chief to accept these arrows as a gift from me. I've made them with great care. With the hope of peace in my heart. I will be very proud to, Lakku. There's nothing more to say except thank you and may the great spirit go with you always. And with you, Hiawatha. I tried not to see you again but I couldn't let you go without telling you. Without telling me what? I want you to stay. I can't do that, but I can come back. - When? - When the leaves fall. - Will you be waiting? - Yes. - What will you tell Ogeema? - The truth. That I love Hiawatha. [flute music] Why don't you stop making those foolish noises? Don't be so nervous. Hiawatha will be here. What makes you so sure? He's already a day late. I know. If he's not here by dark, we'll search for him. In the meantime, one of us better do a little hunting. You've eaten every bit of this huge beast of bear you killed. Well, he was a very fierce animal for its size. He probably chased you until he dropped from exhaustion. (Hiawatha) 'Chibiabos, Kwasind.' Hiawatha. What happened to you? A great deal. First, I encountered a bear. Look. Look at the size of those claw marks. That was a bear. Did you kill him? No. He almost killed me. If it hadn't been for Lakku, I wouldn't be here. Lakku? That's a strange name. - Who is he? - Maker of arrows. He gave me these to present to Megissogwon. Those are Dakota arrows. Right. But let us head for home. I'll tell you about it on the way. [flute music] I've come to a decision I ought to tell you about, my friends. I'm going to take a wife. Don't feel too bad about it. It happens to us all. Who is she? I've told you about the arrow-maker's daughter. A Dakota woman? Wait till you meet her. She's beautiful and good. Perhaps she is but you know what our people think of outsiders. Especially the Dakotas. All the more reason. When they know her, they'll realize the Dakotas are the same as we are. Did you see anything? No. Everything seems quiet. Yes. Too quite. I still don't trust them. - What did you find? - Nothing. I saw no preparations for war. It would be better if you had. Our people are growing soft. Let's start back. Illinois. They're just hunters. They're in their own territory. They are now, yes but they're coming from our country with all that game. Killed within our boundaries. Make ready, both of you. [dramatic music] That one will not go far. I'll report that we killed them within our own boundaries because that's where their bodies will be found. This might really start a war. It'll have to start sometime. We all know that. We can defeat the Illinois. And after we do, we'll move against Mudjekeewis and his Dakotas. I'm hungry. Why don't we camp for the night? With an early start, we can reach home by noon. To shore. We are heroes, my friends. Just as I said we would be. - Did the chiefs believe you? - Of course they did. Did you tell them of the Illinois who escaped? No, he didn't escape us. How far could he have gone? Maybe as far as his own village. If he did, you know what that means. I tell you he couldn't have. And even so, do we fear the Illinois? - No. - Well, then stop worrying. We all now there'll be war between us someday. The council of chiefs listened when I advised making preparations. There'll be a war council in the village tomorrow. [dramatic music] [whispering] Chibiabos, Kwasind. - What is it? - Illinois. A war party. The canoe will get us to the village first. [dramatic music] They will attack at dawn. We'll never reach the village before that. I might get there first if I cut across the river. - Yes. - You follow the Illinois. You may find a way to get past them. [dramatic music] Are you alright? [dramatic music] Megissogwon, Megissogwon. The Illinois have surrounded the village. They're waiting to attack at dawn. The Illinois have surrounded the village. Wake the others. [screaming] [dramatic music] [screaming] [dramatic music] Hiawatha. Iagoo, why didn't you stay where you'd be safe. - I had to do my part. - We'll take you home. No. No, while I still have breath, let me speak. I am a stubborn old man. I burdened you with my endless words even in the face of death. Do not speak such words, Iagoo. It is my time now, and I'm ready. In my youth, I was a great warrior. In battle, I was first. Always. And this was my pride. But I have seen the snows of many winters. And they have brought me a wisdom I.. ...did not have in my youth. I have learned to grieve at the suffering and waste of our wars. Perhaps if we did not make our tribe feared by others 'we in turn would not need to fear.' Now, you, Hiawatha, will lead our clan. Remember my...words. [women humming] Oh, Iagoo, your feet are now upon a different path. The old trail leading you homeward. For four days and four nights you will journey to the land of the hereafter where the spirits of our ancestors dwell. Here's food to sustain you on that journey. And here, a fire which shall light your night. When your spirit reaches that distant land speak to the great Manitou for us, his children. That our tribe may dwell in peace. And men may meet his friends. Speak with naked hearts together. Spirit of Iagoo, farewell. [humming continues] My brothers, we have honored the dead who gave their lives in our defense. The period of mourning is over. Tonight, we meet to honor the living whose courage and bravery won victory over the Illinois. Ajawac will speak. [indistinct murmuring] You know who saved our people. Who warned us in time to destroy the enemy who sought to destroy us. We owe much to Hiawatha. (Ajawac) 'Tonight, following after Iagoo as chief of his clan' we welcome him to his place among the chieftains. And to honor you for the great deed you have done for your people the council of chiefs give you the feather of Kaneu. A mighty eagle. You have the right to wear it as a mark of your courage and daring. My brothers, you've heard. Are there any who think this should not be? [indistinct chattering] Ajawac will continue. Another we honor is Pau PukKeewis. We have long known Pau PukKeewis bravery and daring. 'Always he's been among the tribes leading warriors.' He slew many of the Illinois and was foremost in pursuing those who sought to escape. It is thought good he'd take his place in the war council. You have heard. Are there anyone who think this should not be? Hold. I would speak. I would not have it so. That Pau PukKeewis has great courage, no one doubts. 'It is his judgment I question.' Had he not killed the Illinois hunters there would've been no attack on our people. 'And my son would not have been killed.' I fear you speak hastily out of grief. As you know I've been in many battles. I brought honor to my clan and to my tribe. What our brother said is true. Pau PukKeewis did not stop to think what was good for us all. He should've avoided killing the Illinois hunters. Since when among our people has it been wrong to slay one of an enemy tribe? Was I to run and hide from the Illinois? I come from burying Iagoo, best loved of our chiefs. He died in my arms. His last words were "He who does not want to fear must not live to be feared." Iagoo was an old man. With the wisdom of many winters. In his youth, he was always in the forefront of battle. In his age, he would've undone it all. He died praying to the great Manitou that Ojibwe might learn the wisdom of peace. And did he think he could ever tread a friendly trail to the campfire of the Illinois? - Or the Dakotas? - He did. - And you agree? - More than that. I've already done so. I've waited for this opportunity to announce something to the council. 'I intend marrying a Dakota maiden.' A Dakota maiden? The daughter of Lakku, the arrow maker. Are you not aware this may cause trouble between the tribes? Why should it? Megissogwon, a gift from Lakku, the arrow maker. 'He said he made them with peace in his heart.' Love has made fools out of men before. The council has the right to ban you from the tribe for this. I know. It is a decision not to be made in open council but among the chiefs alone. If you withhold your consent, I will still marry her. Even if we have to live alone in the woods. Outcasts. Without a tribe. [dramatic music] Oh, daughter, bring me the arrow heads. Your unhappiness grieves me. I do not like to see you clinging to a dream. He promised he would return, father. Promises are lightly made and soon forgotten. Do not waste your nights in tears. Would it not be better to accept the love of Ogeema rather then to yearn in vain? I do not love Ogeema, father. How long will you wait? Moons have passed and still you crave. For your own sake and mine will you name a time when you'll put away this hope? And make contentment for yourself. Hiawatha said he'd be back when the leaves began to fall. If he isn't, then I will marry Ogeema. [dramatic music] Chiefs haven't given their consent to my marriage. But they haven't withheld it either. Are there no women among us that you must seek this stranger? I love her. And promised her I'd return. I won't have her wait in vain as you for my father. The Dakotas keep no promises. Why should you? Then I don't have your consent either? You're a chief now. You don't need my consent. Once I agreed to such a marriage. It brought only heartbreak and despair. Like the Illinois Mudjekeewis and all his Dakotas are devils. I wish your heart were not so set against her. I shall accept her as your wife. But I can never give her love. [dramatic music] You sent for me, Megissogwon? Yes, my son. Seat yourself. The council of chiefs has given its consent your marriage. Thank you, Megissogwon. Thank you. The discussions have taken several moons, as you know and there was much disagreement. I can understand this. I am grateful to those that have decided in my favor. I have been one of those from the beginning. I believe in your dream of peace between us and the Dakotas. It need no longer be a dream. I've seen these people, and I know they're good. It was mentioned often in the council that the judgment of a young man in love was not to be trusted. But it was also mentioned.. ...perhaps the eyes of love see more clearly than do the eyes of hate. Go then, my son. To the land of the Dakotas with my blessings. And return here with your bride. [instrumental music] I think it'd be better if we went with you. In case of trouble, you wouldn't be alone. I wont' have any trouble. And I don't expect to be alone for long. [instrumental music] 'Good luck.' Come home soon. Come, let us start to build that.. [instrumental music] [dramatic music] [music continues] It's Hiawatha! 'Hiawatha!' 'It's Hiawatha!' This is Kwasind and Chibiabos. I've told you about them. And this is Nokomis, my grandmother. I'll take you to meet our chief, Megissogwon. [pleasant music] You're welcome, my daughter. When is the marriage feast? In two suns. If the hunting is good. [pleasant orchestral music] [music continues] [music continues] Good. Did Kwasind get his deer? I don't know. He was still trailing it when I left him. They will be enough. [tribal music] [music continues] [music continues] Why isn't Kwasind here? Not like him to miss a feast. [music continues] (PukKeewis) 'Megissogwon!' What is it? What happened? It is Kwasind, he's dead. Kwasind! He was found near the west boundaries. - Killed. - By the Dakotas. (Pau) 'By the cursed men of Mudjekeewis' 'An evil deed but no surprise' 'to those who do not forget Dakota treachery.' You're the chief of Kwasind's clan. When do you plan to lead a party in revenge? I love Kwasind as a brother. If I knew who killed him, I'd hunt him down. But to charge the entire Dakota nation with this crime would only fill both our lands with suffering and death. The Dakota woman makes you forget your duties. This is the way of weaklings. Not of men. This is a matter for my clan. [instrumental music] [music continues] You notice how much easy it is to feed me now than it was the first time? Remember the broth you forced me to eat when I was wounded? I remember. Those were happy days in my fathers lodge. Are not these happy days in your husband's lodge? Oh, you know I'm happy with you, Hiawatha. But during the day when you're not by my side.. I know. The women, the men, even the children turn from me when I approach them. What must I do, Hiawatha? You must be patient, my wife. And believe as I believe that one day my people will love you. For yourself, as I do. Hope that day comes soon. It will. I know it will. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Why do you fetch me water? Your basket was empty. Why are you always doing things for me? I have never asked it. I don't know. Maybe it's because we both love Hiawatha. (Nokomis) Wait here. - You like these? - They're beautiful. Wear them. - Oh, Nokomis-- - Go now. I have things to do. [pleasant music] [music continues] Did I spoil your fishing? I have plenty. Something's made you happy. Nokomis gave me these. - Nokomis? - Yes. She made this necklace for Wenonah, my mother but she died before it was finished. This means Nokomis thinks of you as her daughter. [slow-paced tribal drums] Another bad one. This one is bad too. - Crop is blighted. - What should we do? Summon the men. Call the chiefs. [faced-paced tribal drums] [drumming continues] [drumming stops] Not one ear in five is good. And winter's almost upon us. There will be hunger. Any luck? - What should we do? - I'll try again tomorrow. He's back. We had to beyond the swamp for this one. Cold is driving them south. It will not last long when divided with others who need. - Greetings. May I enter? - Welcome. Some deer meat. We had better luck today. A fine gift these days. Daughter, put this away. Bring tobacco for our guest. Evil days are upon us. Our people suffer much from the lack of grain. What else can we expect? Wasn't Kwasind slain why the Dakotas? Doesn't his death remain unavenged? And still some accept the Dakota woman among us. Too many listen to Hiawatha. Forget the ways of our fathers. We're guilty of many sins. 'This is our punishment.' Our fathers did not sit around and wait for starvation. I know the Dakotas have many buffalos in their territory. And keep much dried meat. We ought to raid their village. Not only avenge our dead we'd be acting as men and warriors. Once when I was young, there was hunger. We made such a raid, and our people ate well after that and won much glory. That's why I came to you, Wabeek. Since the trouble with the Illinois Megissogwon listens to Hiawatha. Not to me. But you're respected by everybody. 'If you spoke, it might do some good.' There is a better way. First, enlist the men who would follow you. Megissogwon will have to listen to you. Then my words will have weight. You are right, Wabeek. Why should we wait here until we're starving? Game is scarce now. It'll be scarce after the first big storm. I've spoken to many, and everyone agrees. By doing this, we avenge Kwasind's death. Spirits of our fathers will be appeased. There'll be no more hunger among us. So I speak to you as Ojibwes and warriors. Will you join me? - I'm for it. - I will join. Why should the Dakotas live in plenty while your child hungers? Hiawatha.. Pau PukKeewis is gathering men to make up a war party. Are you sure? He's going to see Megissogwon, to seek his consent. Is there any way to stop them? Our people are hungry. He's promised them that a raid would provide food. (Hiawatha) 'It's only an excuse.' It's war he wants and glory for himself. My people have always had plenty. I'm sure they'd give us food if they knew our need. I think so too. I know they would. If only we could meet together, not as tribes but as people.. 'Then we might understand each other.' Chibiabos, you must leave at once. - Go to the Dakotas. - Find Lakku, my father. He will take you to Mudjekeewis, our great chief. Tell them that my life with Hiawatha's been good. But tell them also of our need. And I ask that there be friendship between our tribes. Hurry, if you succeed, you'll stop Pau PukKeewis and the war. - I'll leave right now. - And I'll go to Megissogwon. Already more than a 100 warriors have agreed to follow me. With your consent, there'll be more. Many of our men will die. What do you think, Wabeek? I agree with those who prefer to die bravely than starve. (Hiawatha) 'I would speak, Megissogwon.' It's true there is not much food. But if our entire tribe hunted together we might get enough so no one would starve. That can only last a short while. After that, there'll be heavy snows. It'll be difficult, maybe impossible to raid the Dakotas. It would be too late, the sooner it's done the better. Can it be you're speaking for your Dakota wife? That you'd rather see your own people starve than make war against hers? I don't war for anybody. If we go to them as friends 'I know they'll give us food out of their stores.' - I'd rather die than beg. - It would not be begging. It'd be asking as friends.. ...willing to repay when we have plenty. I ask one thing. Chibiabos has gone to Lakku to speak for this. 'Please wait until he returns.' When will that be? Seven suns, no longer. If Chibiabos succeeds, there need be no war. If he fails, you have my consent to make the raid. Your mind is not in what we're doing. I'm impatient for Chibiabos' return. - You think he'll succeed? - He must. With Lakku's help, he will. You think of it too much. Let's finish with this honeycomb. Do not be so troubled, Hiawatha. Chibiabos will be successful, I know he will. You think I'm wrong to worry about him? Of course. Now eat.. ...or must I feed you again? With food as scarce as it is, no one can waste a morsel of it. I hope there will soon be plenty. Chanung, come, let's prepare our canoe. There's another day yet. There may not be a raid. Pau PukKeewis said to be ready. I'll be ready. Pau PukKeewis, I wish to talk with you. I have no words to say to a Dakota woman. I'm a Dakota woman no longer. I'm the wife of an Ojibwe brave, you know that. Besides, the Dakotas are not your enemies, you know that too. - We shall see. - Yes, we shall see. As soon as Chibiabos returns with provisions. Pau PukKeewis, I wanted to talk to you about my husband. - He sent you? - 'No, of course not.' I want to know what it is that makes you hate him so. Because he is weak.. ...traitor and a coward. [birds chirping] [dramatic music] - Any word of Chibiabos? - No. Don't be impatient, there's still time. This is the seventh sun. I see Pau PukKeewis' followers getting their canoes ready. They won't use them. I know my father prevailed upon Mudjekeewis to give us food. I would not put my trust in Mudjekeewis. [women singing softly] Chibiabos.. My son. The Dakotas have killed my son. [fast-paced drumming] [drumming continues] My son has been killed by the Dakotas. The men of all the clans are gathering to avenge his death. All the clans but his own. 'Still you have not given your consent.' When Kwasind died, what you said seemed fair. But how can we disregard the murder of Chibiabos who went to them on an errand of peace? By this, they challenge us to war. What you say is true. Those who wish to join may go. And you, Hiawatha? You were like brothers. 'In our lodge, you were like a second son.' 'It was on a journey for you that he gave his life.' 'Will you not seek to avenge his death?' Chibiabos and I both believed there could be peace. Not while Mudjekeewis is their chief. He has evil in his heart, a man of deceit and false promises. Long ago when I told you of who caused your mother's death 'I told you he lived in a distant land.' I thought you'd seek revenge and might be killed. But I withheld the truth. He is Mudjekeewis, chief of the Dakotas. He must have sanctioned Chibiabos' death. He must be what you say he is.. I know what I have to do now. I'm going, not to kill Dakotas but to bring death to Mudjekeewis. What did you find? Their village is beyond the next hill. Everything is quiet. We better rest here, move in just before dawn. Tell the men. Mudjekeewis! Who calls my name? One who has come to take your life. You are Ojibwe? Yes. [knife clatters] I'll kill you with my bare hands, Mudjekeewis. It's better that way. For Wenonah, my mother.. You are my son. No! I'm Wenonah's son. Wenonah whom you killed. My son.. [exhales sharply] You are still my son. When I came back here, they made me chief. I wanted to return to your village for Wenonah, my wife. But the council of my chiefs would not permit it. I was determined to find a way in spite of this. Then I learned that your mother was dead. Because of my love for her, I never had hatred for Ojibwe. I always fought to discourage warlike acts against them. Your people killed Kwasind, whom I loved and murdered Chibiabos who was like a brother to me and whom I sent as a friend. That is not true. I would've learned of Kwasind's death had the Dakotas killed him. As for Chibiabos, I heard his words and sent him back with a promise that we'd willingly give food if he would return with men to carry it away. If he was slain, it was not by Dakota hands. Then it must've been done by someone who'd like to see war between our tribes. We have little time. A big war party of my people are outside your village waiting for dawn. It's time we move up. Wake up. We move. (male #1) 'Wake up.' It's Hiawatha. Wait here. Megissogwon, there is no need for bloodshed. The Dakotas are willing to help us, give us the food we need. Can this be true? As proof of friendship, Mudjekeewis, their great chief and members of his council have come unarmed to welcome you. Wait. How can we forget the deaths of Kwasind and Chibiabos? Are we going to accept their gifts as bribe for their punishment? Time to strike is now. They're unarmed. 'Capture them, the village will be easy.' They're unarmed because they have no fear. Or no sense of guilt. Chibiabos and Kwasind were not killed by Dakotas. Chibiabos was returning home with promise of aid when he was killed. Murdered by one of our tribe. You're defending the Dakotas again. This time by accusing one of our own tribe. But you forget, in the bodies of Kwasind and Chibiabos were Dakota arrows. Megissogwon, as a gift I once brought three Dakota arrows. Where are they? Pau PukKeewis asked to try them. Where are the arrows? I lost two of them hunting. I still have one left. Useo, did you not say you have the arrow that killed Chibiabos? Yes, I saved it to return to the Dakotas myself. Lakku made only three of these as a gift for our chief. They are the same. Pau PukKeewis, our brother's blood is on your hands. [dramatic music] Go forth now to the Fox, the Ottoway, and the Illinois bearing the gifts we send them. Let them, with their own eyes behold that the Ojibwe and the Dakota come together in peace. And that they therefore too can meet in friendly council. And may the great spirit guide you on your way. [instrumental music] (male narrator) Thus departed Hiawatha, in the glory of the sunset in the purple mist of evening.. Summoning the tribes together saying.. "All your strength is in your union.. "...all your danger is in discord." "Therefore, be at peace hence forward.. "...and as brothers, live together." [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues]
