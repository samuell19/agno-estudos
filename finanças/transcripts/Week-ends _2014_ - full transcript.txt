Excuse me, sir. There... What's wrong? The lot's full. Lucky me! There we go! Hey, calm down! Why get mad? Who do you think you are? You nicked my spot. It's no one's spot. I didn't see you. Yes, you did. You did this. No. I didn't do that. - I did this. - So you saw me then. You saw me! - No. - Don't treat me like an idiot! - Excuse me. - I'll ask nicely. Move right now and give me my spot! No. What d'you mean, no? It's too late. Excuse me. Excuse me! What? What are you going to do? You want to hit me? Go on, then. Get out. - Budge! - Ow. Hey! She stood behind me at the till and carried on. How could I have? Said I'd treated her like a dog. Blah, blah, blah. She lost it. Your sort are responsible for the mess we're in. You're completely insane. Why are you following me? What have I done to you? Hey, Mum! Ow. There were 10 tills, but she stood behind me! What did she look like? I don't know. She was 30 to 35, normal. - Why d'you ask? - I don't know. Maybe she was in difficulty. In difficulty? Shall I put the mackerel on? Go on! She didn't look like she was in real difficulty. - Coming, Jean? - How d'you know? Eating with us, darling? Shall I get a plate? When you're waiting, you put on your indicator. Honestly, do you or don't you put it on? You put it on. A small one. No, well grilled. I'd prefer that one. Give that me, then. Are there any bones? There usually are in fish. Not in cod. You eat frozen cod fillets. Real fish has bones. Let's see. You've stopped wearing a brace? Show me. - He never wore a brace. - I thought he did. Show us your lovely teeth. You're so handsome, Tristan. It's true, isn't it? - Is there any rice? - Yesterday's, in the kitchen. Maybe her indicator didn't work. It's perfectly possible. If that's the case, you stick out your arm. Why are people so aggressive? Their problems make them aggressive. You think? You really think so? It ruined my morning. What? Well, that woman. What woman? The woman at the supermarket. They met in the 1980s. They were barely 20. The four dreamt of the country, a simple life, log fires. They found two houses facing each other by the sea. They were a promise of happiness. WEEKENDS 30 years had gone by. They hadn't realized they'd aged. - It's really nice. - Hey, give us a hand! - Sorry. - Here. There! - Have Théo's room. - What for? You'll be more comfortable in Théo's room. The walls are like paper! We can't fuck like mad. - Did you take a pill? - Half. I don't know how I'm going to sleep now. Did you hear that? It's nothing, just Guérand killing his wife. We can't even be in peace here. Oh, it's you. Isn't Ulrich here? Where's all your medicine? He's at the bakery. In the bathroom. - What do you want? - The sleeping pills I gave you. You gave me sleeping pills? Yes! Last year, when Charlotte got back from California. Really? OK. You're a life saver! I had a terrible night. Us too. We were woken up by an awful racket! One and a half is a lot. Jean has gone. Croissants, girls! And salted butter. He's gone away. Away? At night, he often gets up to pee. Ulrich too. That's rich! It's you who gets up three times a night. As he didn't come back to bed, I got up. He was downstairs. He looked so strange, I thought he was ill. Not at all. He told me he was fine, that I mustn't worry and, in any case, it'd be just the same for me and the children. He simply had something on his mind and wanted to talk. And? He told me he'd decided to go live elsewhere. What's that mean, 'elsewhere?' That's just what I said. We have homes in Poissy and Normandy, a mortgage, the kids' university fees and we're broke. We can't afford to live elsewhere! I told him to think it over, come back to bed and we'd discuss it. He refused. He said he had to leave at 6:00 am. - I'll just take a yoghurt. - You could say hello! I'm not joking! Coffee, Christine? It's just a mid-life crisis. He'll come back. - You think so? - Yes. Did he take the car? No, no... Not the car, come on! What about me? How would I manage without it? I drove him to the station. Jean had left Christine. He'd done it. That night, for the 1st time, Sylvette realized she'd spend the rest of her life with Ulrich, there'd be no after Ulrich. Ulrich wondered why he'd decided to stay in Paris 30 years previously. What had made him move in with a girl he barely knew? It goes so fast. You put on a kilo or 2, age 10 years without realizing it, and then your guy leaves you. Come on! After 29 years, a kilo or 2! 29 years? They've known each other for 46. They have. But us, it's 29 years. Us two? No, them... We've been friends with them for almost 29 years, no? They're our best friends. The Papichettes too, of course. Jean isn't like that. It isn't a kilo or 2. Really? What is it then? Each became aware of the fragility of their existence. It hung by a thread. The summer went by. Their 1st summer without Jean. Hey, Dad! Christine cried a lot. She thought about their life, herself and Jean. On waking each morning, she imagined he was on the boat or simply downstairs lighting the stove. At the end of autumn, she understood he'd gone for good. A new life began. There we go. It's Christine. Hello, Christine. Hi. Christine, you gave us a real fright. You came in the end. I wanted to light a fire but had no time. You should go to bed. It's late. - I could help you... - No. - I'll go. - I've got it. Have you noticed? I had my colour redone and decided to get a perm too. Yes. It suits you. How are the kids? I thought Tristan had a tummy bug. That's why you didn't come to the Papichettes. - They're with Jean. - Where? He turned up this morning to get his things. He figured he'd get out of looking after the kids. He disappears, washes his hands of them. I said to him, "You've had your fun. "This weekend, look after your kids." He's in a bad way. You should see him. He looks awful. He's lost at least 6 kilos, maybe more. Who? Jean? You've seen him? He's in Poissy. - He's come home? - To look after the kids. - He's lost at least 6 kilos. - The kids are in a bad way. And I'm in a bad way too. Everyone's in a bad way since he decided to leave. But I know what he's up to. He wants to sell up. - To sell Poissy? - No. Normandy. He wants to sell our house here. But he can think again! It's my house. It's his house too. His? He's never been interested in Poissy or Normandy. He's not interested in anything. - If you ask me, he's depressive. - No. Depressed. No. No. Depressive. And it isn't recent either. Has he called you? No. He rarely called anyway. I'm not surprised. He's in awe of Ulrich. It's true. You've always been an example for him. - Me? - Yes. Sylvette is Jean's friend. You met as kids. We met at high school. We weren't very close then, or later in fact. Us, apart from the boat... It's scary. I realized Jean had no friends. - It's time for bed. - Yes. Are you exhausted? Right, well, I'll be going then. - And dinner? - We'll have a snack. Yes. I'll have a snack too. Right. I'll be off then. - Bye. - Good night, Christine. Here. I saw you eyeing it. She's obviously in a bad way. What can we do to help her? You know... If it goes on, she'll have a breakdown. She's given us hot water bottles. Yes. Do you think... Jean has a mistress? - I've eaten donkey salami. - It doesn't exist! Hello! Ah! Hi, Christine. Hello. Flo. Marc-Antoine. Friends visiting the area. Christine, our neighbour. - And friend. - And friend, of course. Nice to meet you. - You too. - Hello. I bought you some bread. Thanks, that's sweet. Haven't we already met in Cormeilles? You're Pierre's wife, huh? No. Jean's. I'm Jean's wife. Right, well, I'll be going. Christine, do you have any plans? No? Um... No, I've no plans. Then come over later. Come have coffee with us. Yes, OK. Why not? Christine is a bit depressed at the moment. Yes. She's separating. She and Jean. Well, he's leaving her. I don't know why, but I thought as much. And the name of that town? Nuc. - Am I too late? - Not at all. Come in. - Have a seat. - Thanks. - It's freezing! - Coffee, Christine? Thank you, Ulrich. There you go. I really love this area. It's damp, but you get used to it. Don't exaggerate! It's always fine, at least once a day. We had a rotten summer last year. Flo is from the South. So she always need to be warm. I far prefer it her. I love the light in the North. Are you moving here? We're looking around. Aren't we, darling? Yes. In fact, if you know of a house for sale... Why are you asking me that? For no reason. For nothing. And you, Christine, what do you do? What do I do? We were colleagues at a primary school and she took early retirement 6 months ago to... To... To... - To... - To be able... To make the most of life As a result... Well, we know the result. - Do you know the result? - Yes. The result is... I'm getting divorced! Relationships between couples are kind of pathological. I sense that Marc-Antoine wants a debate. He always exaggerates! It's... - You always exaggerate, Marco. - But... We were happy here. Very happy. Honestly. Weren't we happy? Yes. Of course. I'm going to go. I've got cleaning to do. Christine! Christine... They're really stupid, especially him. - Jean! - Yes. - Hi. - Hi, Charlotte. Isn't Charlotte here? No. No. Hang on... - This is Pascale. - Hello. Charlotte, the best friend of my Charlotte. Ah right, two Charlottes. How amusing! Was it deliberate? Yes, actually. We're the same age. We were born 6 days apart. Are you divorced then? Yes. Actually, no, not yet, but soon. - Are your parents here? - They're out shopping. Have you been to see the sea? No? You have to. It'll be the turn soon. The turn? Yes. It's when the tides turn. The weather changes. The clouds are moving in. - See? - Yes. - Which way's the sea? - It's... I'll show you later. It's... It's there. Just to say hello, rather than avoiding them. No. I can't do it. It'd be like... Like stabbing Christine in the back. I'm surprised by your lack of open-mindedness. So you could come here, sleep in our bed with your new mistress and go for drinks with your old friends? I never said that. Between civilized people... Coming? We're playing a match. Huh? Hey, that's my water! Get some tap water. - Hello! Nice to meet you. - Hello. Ulrich. And you are...? Jean's partner, Pascale. - Sylvette. Nice to meet you. - Likewise. It's overcast now. It often is here, but it can change. No more badminton? With this wind... Besides, I'm a lousy player. I wanted to see the sea, but finding the path isn't easy. It's very easy. It's that way, 1st left then straight ahead. You can't go wrong. Walk along the edge of the cornfield. Then there's a path that slopes gently down to the sea. Just don't go right where it forks. Right, OK. It takes... What? Fifteen minutes tops. Plus it's low tide now. It's an extreme low tide so the beach will be clear. Yes. It's the turn soon. The turn? No, not yet, I think. - See you later. - See you. You creep! - Where are you going? - For a ride. Can't you wear a jumper? When will you be back? - What's the matter? - I spoke. Didn't you hear? I said something and it woke me up. Really? No, I didn't hear you. - What did you say? - I don't know. I said something very clearly. It's nothing, it happens. - It happens to me. - It does? Yes. Ulrich. Yes? Would you do that to me? Come here. Is that Jean? It's beautiful. Turn the light off. Are you OK? Take another sleeping pill. Say something. - What's the matter? - Nothing. You haven't worn that for ages. - Is it still OK? - Yes. What? Should I change? No. It's very nice. - Don't you have your ring? - Yes. I put some cream on earlier... - And the mussels! - Oh yes. No. You can call later. It's time to go. It's Christine. We'll call her later. Here. Thanks. - A fire at this time of year? - A fire is great any time. To us. To love and friendship. To being together. - To you. - Cheers! Cheers. Sorry! Sylvette, may I? That's a pretty ring. She isn't used to it. Sylvette can't stand jewellery. - It's her rebellious side. - No. I love this ring. A 29th-year anniversary gift. - 29 years? - 30 soon. When we met, Sylvette was into Latin Americans not German guys. That's mine. I didn't turn it off. Right, well... Let's eat. Would you like plates? - I think we need plates. - I'll get them. - Where are they? - The sideboard, at the top. Sorry. I'll call later. No. There aren't any plates. There aren't? Here they are. I'll go turn it off. You must be in demand. Got any concerts planned? Thanks. We haven't heard you for ages. Jean has a project in the area. Here? Yes, touring local abbeys. I'm planning it with Pascale. Excuse me. Yes? Look, we're not going to talk now. Would you like some oysters? Thank you. - Sylvette? - No thank you. Some mussels? What difference does it make? It makes none. It makes no difference! And I don't have to explain. Your house? It's mine too. I paid for the house. I've paid for everything for 30 years. It's indecent, is it? Give me a break! Stop hassling me! I don't want to talk. Is that clear? Did you like the sea? Yes, it's very beautiful. In my book, it's called bigamy! A married man who takes another woman, it's quite simply bigamy. Married for 25 years, three children, two homes... - I said it first. - Yeah, right! What a cheat! Who cares anyway? Go on, draw a card. Yes, honey, take a card. And look where we are now. After 25 years... No one does that, huh? I mean, who does that? A insane man, a madman! Your go! You want war, huh? Well, you'll have it, believe me. We'll spew our anger in your face. We'll never forgive you. Ever! Bringing... that woman here! Under my roof! In my bed, my sheets! Sheets that I bought. Proust! He reads Proust now. Phoney! Elsewhere! Elsewhere is just here, with another woman. Mum, can I get you anything? My baby. No. You're sweet, very sweet. You've reached Jean. Please leave a message. Jean, it's me. I'm below the cliffs. On the beach I love. That meant so much to us. I'm thinking about what you've done. It's despicable. You've destroyed my life and our kids'. You've destroyed everything. I'll never forgive you. By the way, you could've had the decency to bring your own sheets and towels. Anyone else would've thought of sheets and towels. But yet again, I can say tact isn't your strong point. For sure. There... That's all, Jean, that's all. You don't need to brake so suddenly. Yeah, but it was great. It was so cool! I loved it. You'll see, it's great on the bends. I worked out the pedals. - Take it easy though. - But she's making great progress. - Where are you going? - For a ride. What about your homework? OK. Just be careful! Oh, it doesn't matter. Oh dear! - Shall we have pigeon? - I don't like it. It's fatty. Hello! There we go! She's angry. No. She's going to Monique Guérand's. I don't see why. We've only seen Pascale three times. At most. What are you doing? It's the armchair we gave her. Maybe we could take it back. She must've redecorated. Ah, you here? I am pleased. - Come in! - It was just to say hi. We don't want to bother you. You're not bothering me. - I thought we'd fallen out. - No, not at all. We thought you needed to be alone. Ah yes, you're right. I was very alone. I'm getting rid of my furniture. Then it'll be the house. You've decided to sell it then? After all my times here, after all our times here with the children, it's time to move on. I've found a course. - What sort? - Gregorian chants. Really? My teacher says I have a real flair. But as no one ever encouraged me... Especially not Jean. That's for sure. I helped him so much. But anyway. I've decided to follow my own path now. Good! Make a clean break with the past. Precisely. Do you mind if we take back the armchair? Which armchair? - This wicker chair. - I think that's for me. We'll be off then. Nice to meet you. - And the two squat armchairs? - Yes, those too. They're not worth much. - They have sentimental value. - Yes, but... Yes, of course. I know. I think we're done. With the rest and what's outside, it's one load. Don't you want to know how much? Ah yes, of course. How much? It'll fetch about 300. 300? Well, 350 at a push, but no more. It's... OK, that's fine. Excellent. Would you like coffee? I've made some. Yes, why not? All right. Thank you. - Are you local? - No. From the Paris area. Can't you tell? - But you like the country? - Hardly! - I like it without sugar. - Oh sorry. No, no. I said it was fine. Do you mind if I smoke? Cigarette smoke doesn't bother me. There are fewer temptations here. - Temptations? - Yes. Well, I know what I mean. Are you going to sell your house? I don't know. - It depends. - Sure. Getting divorced? Ah no, not at all. I'm in a reflective frame of mind. - Sure. - Crises are inevitable. Sure. Every couple has crises. Sure. Sure... - Do you have children? - Four. - Four is a lot. - Yes. - And they live...? - With their mum. Or rather, with their mums. Because I'm no good as a dad. I'm a bastard apparently. You seem very nice though. When you've had enough, you've had enough. We gotta make the most of life. You obviously don't. You're not that bad for your age. When I saw you, I thought, She isn't bad. - You did? - Yes. I'm careful. I'm careful too. I go to the gym most days. Abs, press-ups, abs, press-ups. Look, it's rock hard. It's a matter of dignity. Shit! Your share of the sale Where are you going? I forgot my book in the car. I don't care. She'll give me a fake smile again. Hello. Christine's room Did you know about Charlotte? Yours. Did you know she was here? Yes. She's at Ulrich and Sylvette's this weekend. But I thought she couldn't come. Didn't you ask her to come with us? Yes. Yes. But she must've thought... it was simpler. She figured it was too complicated. The three of us. Here. They've invited us over for coffee. Nice of them, huh? - Hello. - Hi! - Jean won't be long. - All right. Come in. Go ahead. Jean won't be long. This is my mum. Speak loudly, she's as deaf as a post. Mum! - This is Pascale. - Hello. You know, Pascale. Yes. I'm Pascale, Jean's partner. Hello, madam. Charlotte and Théo have a surprise. Is it a show? Is the surprise a show? - I'll get the rest - No. Yes. I'll make the coffee then. You OK? Coffee, Françoise? Hello! - Hello, Sylvette. - Hello. - How are you? - Fine. Françoise, I'm pleased to see you. - You OK? - Yes. Very well. - Like a coffee? - I'd love one. That's great! Dad, an Easter egg for you. An egg for me! Grandma, an egg for you too, of course. Thank you. It's good. Don't cut such big slices! Thanks. Thank you. It's good. Good! Aren't you hungry? She was sick last night. Really? - Got a temperature? - It's just a tummy ache. You need some charcoal. I've got some... actually Want to go to Vouyaud's? - No, it's OK. - It's a good time to go. Right... We'll pop into the village. I'll come with you. Me too. Sorry. They've gone? To see Vouyaud. It's a good time. Charlotte is fragile right now. Obviously. Yes, obviously. Mum, would you like another coffee? - What? - Another coffee? Didn't I say I was going to the boat? Ah, no... Didn't you need the car? Why not wait for Jean? I'm going to call Monique Guérand. It's good. You're ever so young. Oh, not that young. Love, you know, is beautiful but rare. I used to have a friend when I was your age. A great friend. Her name was Clotilde. She died last year, my friend Clotilde. She had a great love affair. She left one day with the love of her life. They moved to Canada, to Vancouver. She'd come back almost every year. We'd write. But she'd come back and we'd meet up. Yes. Clotilde... I was never lucky in love though. Thank God, I had literature in my life. Especially poetry. "Here are fruits, flowers, leaves and branches, "and here is my heart which beats only for you, "Do not tear it with your two white hands, "And may my humble present be sweet in your beautiful eyes!" "I arrive, still all covered with dew. "Which the morning wind freezes on my forehead. "Permit my weariness, resting at your feet, "To dream of dear moments that will relax it." I'm very fond of Jean. He's such a nice boy. And he has his music. A year went by. Jean came to the country a few times, then less and less and finally not at all. Sylvette's mother died suddenly at the end of winter. Sylvette and Ulrich spent several weekends in the Poitou. They had to clear the house, sort the things, throw out the papers the meticulous old lady had stored in her drawers for the past 30 years. Among her six children's school reports, the bank statements and bills, Sylvette found, carefully tied with ribbons, her mother's correspondence with her friend Clotilde. There were many letters, some long, as well as cards sent for birthdays or for Christmas. They'd been filed by year, year after year since 1956. They all began with "My dearest friend" or "My dearest Françoise". Sylvette hesitated. As she disliked archives as well as mementoes, she threw them out too. It's all warm now. It's still good. Want some more? No thanks. It was delicious, but I've got indigestion. I burnt the sausages. It's the peppers. Leave that. Really? - Leave it. - OK. Hey, it's Christine. Hello! How are you? Very well! Yes? Gosh! They seem happy. - I'm pleased for them. - Me too. Let's invite them. - Great! - Go ask them. - Come with me. - No. I've got the dishes. - I'll wait for you then. - Are you afraid? It's just nicer to go together! To mark the occasion. Jean! Hi! We've really missed you. How about coffee? I don't drink it anymore. - You've lost more weight. - So everyone tells me. Come for dinner tonight. It's my job to invite you. - Why not come to ours? - There's a leg of lamb for you. I insist. Come. Granny had the same. I must've been 7 or 8. Granny Jeannie in Romorantin. Remember, Jean? We almost bought a big bistro mirror but it was speckled. That can be quite pretty. - How much? - 20 or 25 euros. You should've got it. Anyone want coffee with pudding? I'll give you a hand. It's great you've managed to overcome this. Isn't it? We're very strong. Charlotte, your mother will be furious. It's like Granny's! She's over the moon. Nothing can upset her. Thanks for the leg of lamb. It was delicious. Wasn't it shoulder? It's less fatty and tasty. - No, it was leg. - Ah, right. See you tomorrow. We've nothing planned. It's the holidays. - See you! - Good night. Come on, then. How about walking to the tennis court? Why not the chapel? When I'm in the fields, it makes me want to be a horse. - A horse? - Yes. No, actually, a pony. - It's a disaster! - What? Jean's trying to limit the damage. The ground floor's flooded. The hot water tank exploded. Shit! Sylvette, do you have a spare toothbrush? - Yes. - My mouth's all furry. Of course. Honestly, I really don't feel like going back. Huh, Jean? What a disaster! But it'll be better tomorrow, huh? Yes. Take the red. Charlotte won't mind.s All right. Don't you want to brush your teeth? You'll feel better. Or at least take a shower. No. I'm fine. Yes? Sleep well. You too. Good night. Just a sec. Jean! Can't you sleep either? What's wrong, pal? I had an awful nightmare. It's terrible, I... I feel totally... alone. Alone in the world. I have no friends. You're my only friend, Ulrich. Could you take me in your arms? Just 5 minutes, so I can feel someone. What's going to happen now? What do you mean? With the insurance? No. Not the insurance. Life. Come on. I'm scared, Ulrich. I'm scared. But... What are you scared of? It'll pass. Don't worry. - You think so? - Yes. Aren't you scared? Me? No. All this time... We've known each other all this time and you're still here. You haven't changed. Do you and Sylvette still make love? Of course. Without love, you're powerless. And is it strong? I mean do you really desire one another? Come on! What? Is he bothering you? Who? That boy. Not at all, Mum. Honestly! It was like any other summer really, with cold showers and sunny spells. Maybe it had a stronger taste. As if they realized the world had changed and nothing could ever stop it. - Good morning! - Hello. Who are you then? I was hungry. Want some coffee? She said not to make loads of noise. - Who? Shacha? - Shacha? My Shacha, the princess of the virgin forest. She's your daughter then? Yes. I'm the dad. You could say that. Sorry you found me like this. But it isn't what you think. I don't think anything at all. You do. You're thinking... "They met on the beach yesterday, and hey!" It isn't like that. You didn't meet yesterday? Yes. But I love Charlotte. How do you know? You know... You know when it's important. Really? Are you going to ask for her hand? I'd love to. Really. But it isn't mutual. She wants to leave it there. She does? Where are All my lovers? All those who loved me so Back when I was beautiful Adieu the unfaithful They are I don't know where At other rendezvous My heart is as young as ever Where are all my lovers? In my sadness and the night that is back I am alone, isolated, without support With no shackles but without love either Like a wreck, my heart is heavy I who once knew happiness Nights of partying and admirers I am a slave to my memories And that makes me suffer Where are all my lovers? All those who loved me so Back when I was beautiful Adieu the unfaithful They are I don't know where At other rendezvous My heart is as young as ever Where are all my lovers? Gone.
