You sure did pick a good time to be wondering in the middle of the night, lady. Hey, can you hear me? I can't help you. All I can do is get you to the nearest station, okay? Hey, what's your name? I'll call you Birdie. Spider Spider? What does that mean, spider? I don't know how to explain it. I mean, from the time I wake up until the time that I go to sleep. It's just the same thing day in and day out. I really feel like no matter how hard I try, nothing's gonna happen. Keep the calls short. The longer you speak, the more money we lose. We lose money, we lose the amount of workers we have. Worker means you. I don't want to see all loosey goosey with the clients. They're not your friends, they're your paycheck. I just, I feel like there's something missing. Have you ever just wanted to be someone else? With my job, I'm someone new every night. Last night, I was a nurse, a French maid, and a German housekeeper. There's a difference? There's a difference. Either way, you mentioned wanting to become someone else. Maybe it's time you try it. Okay. That's a great idea. How about, I just call up Angelina Jolie or, I don't know, Jennifer Lopez and see if they want to trade lives for a day. I'm serious. That right there is what scares me. The fact that you're serious. Look, do you want me to help you or not? Do I have much of a choice? Doesn't matter. Because I'm gonna help you whether you like it or not. Meet me in one hour. Okay. So this is just up your alley, man. You're gonna like it. Let me see. We have to do this gig. You took these pictures? I acquired them. Acquired them. I like it. You like it a lot. You like it a lot, and it's gonna be a big fish. So you got a driver for this? We need someone we can trust. I've got a driver. - Who? Jackie-D's crazy ass? Never again. So who you got? What the fuck, man? You gonna serenade me to death? Lucas fucking Parker. Long time, man. I'll say. You weren't so gray last time I saw you. It's my retired look. I've earned it. Yeah, I should have clocked you with that. I got a doorbell. You know that, right? Yeah well, with a shitty lock. Living upstate has made you soft. You got any pastrami? Man. Look, I was gonna one, but you don't have anything. What's up, man? Been back for three months and you can't stop by? I mean, I've got to find out that you're in town through our aunt? Been busy, you know? Yeah. Hey man, I know how it is. But I forgive you. Whatever. So, what's all this retirement stuff about? I hit a big one, whoo. I'm leaving this town, baby, starting over. I didn't think that there was any score big enough for you. Oh hell yeah, this one was. I hooked up with Biggie. Yeah, you used to be his boy. You know how it can get. Yeah. Well whatever, I'm glad you're getting out before it catches up to you. How's Billy doing? You know what? That's funny. I was getting ready to mention him. I spoke to him on the way over here. Yeah? How he's doing? Is he surviving? - He's doing good, man. You'd be surprised. He's come a long way from picking old ladies' purses. Yeah? Yeah, he's starting to do his own thing. Actually, he's got a thing coming up tonight. His own thing? Yeah, yeah. He's got his own thing. And uh he's got a couple of guys working with him. He's building his own crew now? Oh yeah, yeah. He's working with Biggie. See now why would he do a stupid thing like hook up with Biggie? 'Cause, we gotta eat. Not everybody got a ticket out of here like you did. Yeah well, look where I am now. You'll be on your feet in no time. Hey like, what are you doing for cash nowadays? Fuck you, Lucas. What? Don't you fucking look at me with that I'm not up to anything look, because that's the same fucking look you gave me the first time you offered me a job. I did? Really? All right man, I'm sorry man. You got me, man. My bad. So? Look man, it's a small job. Five guys, max. That's it. Five guys? Yeah. One guy is a small job. Five guys is a 10 year stretch. - Nah, I mean I get that. But look, it's for Billy. The guy who used to run his mouth off, and I'd have to beat guys up for him? Look, he's not the same guy. Things have changed since you've left. Billy's like a, like a mastermind. A mastermind? Now I'm definitely not doing it. And you shouldn't be doing it either. Look if you guys want to get back together like old times, we can go out to the bars, pick up some girls. But that heist shit, that got old for me a long time ago. Yeah well, you know what, man? I've looked in your refrigerator, and that's some sad shit. Ramen Noodle Soup? I mean the shit is not even in a can. Look man, just do this one small job, and then you can buy fucking, all the cans you fucking want. Lucky, I didn't spend the past few years slaving away to come back and end up in jail over some stupid shit. Look, it's not even about all that. What's it about? It's about Fred Potterfield. Who the fuck is Fred Potterfield? Fred Potterfield is a man that lives in a modest home, but not necessarily modest money. Old as fuck. I mean this dude doesn't even trust anybody. He doesn't even trust the bank with his money. The problem is that he doesn't trust anybody. He's got surveillance cameras, silent alarms, the works. Here's the kicker. His wife is dead. But, before his wife died, he used to buy her jewelry. Tons and tons of jewelry. And I'm not talking about that K-Mart blue light special bullshit. I mean I'm talking about shit that has only been touched by indigenous South African kid, shit. Look, it's a two man job. I need a two man team. Come in through the top, come in through the bottom basement. That's it, you're in and out, split the profits. It's like Christmas. And the good thing, you don't have to go in. All you have to do is drive. Just drive? No lifting, no sweeping, just drive? You're the fastest driver in the city. You're faster. I'm better. But like I said, I'm retired. What about Jackie-D? I just did a job with Jackie-D. He's moving on. Look, it'll be like a reunion. After the heist, we can go out to the club. We can hang out with some bitches. Man, I've got everything hooked up. What's with the bag? What else would I carry with me all the time? That's my retirement fund. Someone is gonna fucking shoot you for that. Look, we're gonna have a meeting at six, go over everything, okay? Just call me before then. I know that you're gonna say yes, just. I don't think I should do this. Well, once you get your grandmother librarian dress off, you'll actually look like a real girl. I like this dress. Because it keeps people out. Well yeah, sometimes that's a good thing. Sometimes. Look, I'm pulling out. I don't know how you convinced me to do this to begin with. Because you're trying to stop your slow and steady decline into becoming the old pigeon lady.

But I did have to make my grand exit. Did you see that guy in there? Guy? I was dress hunting. The only thing that I saw was silk. Why, was he hot? No. I mean yeah. I don't know, I just. There was something about him. Maybe you should have gotten his number. Please. I already humiliated myself already. I'm sure he didn't even notice. Birdie! You forgot your credit card. You know, you might have more luck with that if you put it in your pocket. Thanks. All right, guys. Come on. We're gonna be five guys, one car. I know, I know. We don't have two cars. We want to keep it low key. So we've got one car. We've got six minutes. Six minutes till the back up generator is gonna come up again, okay? Any questions? Is there any pets? Pets? Pets. You know, dogs, cats, birds, pets. Does the guy have any pets? Okay, as of now I don't know. I can find out within an hour, okay? Cool. Greg? I don't know. What do you mean, you don't know? You've got this one guy talking about pets. Doesn't seem like you've really covered all your bases here. We can do this. We've done jobs within three, what four minutes last time, right? This is possible. This is just to show you how professional we are. All right? Six minutes, that's all. You've got to be in the car six minutes by yourself, and then we get back and we're out of there. Well? What are you doing here? Well, things didn't work out up North, so I came back home. It happens. It shouldn't have. And who got you into this? It was fucking Lucky wasn't it? Lucky said he wanted to spread some money around. And I heard you was retired too. Man, who the fuck asked you? Look, I just thought if you know if- - You just can't get your hand out of the fucking cookie jar. That's it, right? I said you guys were gonna give me a hear attack, and you come back to finish the fucking job. Come here, you stupid little cock sucker. It's good to see you. You've been all right? It fucking pisses me off that I'm so happy to see you. Why don't you buy me a drink? Yeah, I'll buy you a drink. Hey old man, I've got him. Hey old man. You've got one more fucking old man in you before I rip your throat out of your head. So you could be "Pulp Fiction", or you could be blue sapphire. Or you could be the sexiest My Little Pony. Juliette, are you serious? Yes. Oh wait, oh my God, oh my God. Check these out. What the hell are those? Lets just say the client likes green eyes. Can you not look so gloomy? I'm just worried that- - No, that's just it, tonight is the night you're supposed to let that shit go. Just have fun. Can you do that for one night? And you're 100% certain that all I have to do is just show up, look pretty, chit chat a little bit. And then I can leave, right? Of course you can leave. You need to show up, chat, and have fun. That's the whole point. And yes, don't worry. I'm not a whore, I'm a call girl. We just make the party more fun. So what do you say? Okay, fine. Good. 'Cause trust me. Tonight is gonna be a night that you never forget. You going on a heist, or are you joining a blues band? He's saving eyes for the job. Yeah, and I'm saving my ears too. So shut the fuck up. Jimmy, if I'm late for my bingo game, you are gonna be really early for the unemployment line. Shit. Hey. Hey, hey excuse me. Hey lady. Hey miss, are you okay? Hey? Can you hear me? Hey, hey. Are you okay? Oh, Christ. Wait a second. You're the girl from that store, the one with the birdseed. Birdie. Spider. Spider? What does that mean, spider? What the fuck is going on? Oh shit. You got tagged? Yeah, no shit. Dude, what the fuck happened to our window, Billy? We were supposed to have a window. Same thing that happened to my arm. We got ambushed. I'm talking about the alarm. One thing I know, I'm the house looking for the loot, the next thing I'm standing in the middle of a bright ass room with my dick in my hand, and the fucking alarm blaring in my ear. I don't know. He might have had a backup generator or something. It should have shown up on my research. Yeah, research my ass. Who the fuck was in that black car? Could be people trying to bump us off. It happens. All right, they weren't after the money. They were after us. How are you so sure about that? They know what they were doing. They were after us, not the fucking loot. And more importantly, they knew that we were alone in the dark with no witnesses. This was an ambush. Jeez what are you guys, fucking stupid? Where's Lucky? I've been calling him ever since this shit hit the fan. Look. Lucky told us that when the heat comes down, he's gonna bail, right? So let's just lay down for a couple of days and wait until he contacts us. Until then, just, just, just watch your backs is all. All right, either way we gotta ditch this car and get the fuck out of here. We'll figure out the rest later. Hey, Birdie Birdie, you all right? Where am I? Hey, relax. It's all right, your safe now. It's all over. What's all over? Who are you? Am I being kidnapped? What? No. I'm taking you to a hospital. A hospital? Why? Am I badly hurt? What's wrong? Don't you remember? I don't know what the hell is going on, okay. I'm drenched. I'm wet. Why am I wet? That's kinda the million dollar question. You're the guy from that department store. Greg. Right. What happened tonight? What exactly happened? I can't fill in the blanks for you. I just came in when those guys in the black car started shooting at us. What? That's it, just take me home. Take me home now. I live in Boyle Heights. How far are we? - About 30 minutes away. - Okay. What happened? I don't remember. It's like most of the night is missing. Missing? Someone must have slipped you something. Do you think that you were raped? We've got to get you tested. No, it was nothing like that. How can you be sure? It's like I blanked out after. After what? I don't know. The next thing I remember is, Greg. And we're in the car driving and he's telling me people were shooting at us. What? Yeah, that's what I said. Who the fuck is Greg? And what do you mean people were shooting at you? Remember the guy at the department store? Oh, Mr. Sexy Bottom? Yeah, him. He said he found me wondering down the road half naked and, half way out of my mind. Sammy, I am so sorry. No I am so sorry. This is all my fault. I mean if I knew that it was dangerous, I would have never would have let you go in there. I know, I know you wouldn't have. It's okay. I am staying here with you. I think that it's better if I'm left alone a little bit. I just, yeah, I just need to be alone for a little bit. I'm sorry. It's okay. Come here. I'm gonna go talk to the agency, okay? And see what they can come up with. Who knows? I'll come check on you later, okay? Greg said he might stop by too. I mean, yeah. Really? Well, it's good that despite all of this, you can still get your groove on. Julie? Just make sure that he buys you dinner first, okay? It's not like that, he's just- - It doesn't matter, Sammy. It's okay. Just get out of here. Get some food. I'll do my best. You just take care of yourself, okay? Okay. Great. And after dinner, give him some. It'll brighten your day. So, you don't remember anything from that night? Not exactly. I mean, it comes in flashes. What about the faces of the guys that are after you? Do you remember any of that? Kinda. Kinda? I wasn't wearing my glasses. I have a hard time seeing without them, so. You said something that night that stood out to me. You said the word spider. Does that mean anything to you, spider? Spider. I think I remember someone wearing something that looked like a spider. I don't know. I mean, maybe it was my delirium. Yeah, I know it's crazy. I remember how I got wet. Yeah, how? I was in the shower. I mean that's all I remember, so. I was in the shower, I got wet. That's it? Yeah, I remember- - Okay, well hey at least it's something, right? Yeah. All right. Now I have a serious question for you. It's totally personal, so brace yourself. What in the world were you doing with what looked like a quart of birdseed in your purse the other day? Well, you really know how to ask the tough ones don't you? Hey. I told you, I can cut deep. Me and Oprah, baby. That's a little bit of a longer story than you'd think. You don't get pecked to death on your way to work, or nothing like that? No, not exactly. So what is it exactly that you do? I work with my hands, Mister Fix-it type stuff. People just call you up and you swish in like Superman or something? Yeah yeah, that's a good way of looking at it. Well, I think so. How else would you look at it? Glorified unemployed. Nah, I mean. I'm joking, it's all right. You know, it's just, it's not my passion, that's all. What is your passion? All right. Music. I want to make music. Music? What kind of music? That's a harder question to answer than you think. Well if you ask me, I think that's kind of neat. Neat? Okay. Well, what about you. What do you do? - I work in customer service. Telephone customer service. You like it? You hate it. I can tell you hate it. Well, like is definitely a strong word to use. Do I like the benefits, and a steady job, and a paycheck every two weeks? Yeah, of course. But do I like the micromanaging, and customers that act like little kids when they can't get their way, or told they have to have their veggies before their desert? I can't exactly say I like that part too much. Sounds more like wrangling cats than a service. Yeah, well it's honestly not that bad. So why do you hate it, then? How do you mean? - I don't know, I can just. I'm good at reading people. It's like the other day when I saw you in the department store, and was like. I don't know. It's just a feeling I couldn't shake. - Dang it, girl. Answer your phone. I checked into what happened that night, and no one is talking but they get all weird when you mention it. Something's not right. I'm getting a real bad feeling. Could you come over tonight? It doesn't feel safe. What the hell is with you people, breaking into my apartment? Well, if you didn't have such shitty fucking locks, that wouldn't be a problem, now would it? And you're out of pastrami. Yeah, I know. You're not gonna make me one? What, you don't know your way around your own kitchen? So, I did a little checking around. Yeah? And you know how it is. Nobody knows nothing. But there's one name that keeps coming up. Yeah? Biggie. Christ, how is he still alive? Because if anybody tries to get to him, they gotta contend with me. I may be retired, but nobody's got the balls to go toe to toe with me. And you're still protecting him why? I'd do the same for you. That's different. Why? Because you took a vacation? You make it sound like he's the devil. I remember when you guys were all tight. Anaheim. Anaheim? Jesus Christ, Greg. Really? For real? - He burnt us, Willie. He burnt us bad. People died just so he could get ahead. Not to mention Jamie A. You protected him for years. He was your boss. You retired, Biggie takes over, and two weeks later he ends up dead. Shot in his office. You think that's a coincidence? The kid was new. And there was a lot of people out after Jamie. Biggie just dropped the ball. That's all there is to it. That's not what I heard. I heard Biggie shot him in the middle of a conversation. Not even an argument, he just waited for Jamie to let his guard down. He wouldn't do that. Look, I know that you want to believe that. Biggie, he's not the same kid that Billie and I used to roll with. He's got dirt on his hands. But clean hands don't put food on the table in this city. That's really not the question here. The question here is what a fucking musician doing boosting houses? I thought I could talk Billy out of it if I came along. By driving the car? I just thought maybe if I came along, I could talk to him, get a second to- - You shouldn't have been there in the first place. Now look at the shit you're in. What happened upstate, anyway? Didn't work out like I thought it would. I know you're not planning on pulling jobs for the rest of your life. So, what exactly are you planning on doing? I'm still figuring it out. When I was your age, I was already married, I had a nice girlfriend, I had a couple of kids, I had a good profession boosting jewelry. I mean you're 30 years old, and you're still trying to put the pieces together? There could be something wrong with you. No offense but, things have changed a lot since you were my age. Then maybe there's something wrong with the times. Listen, kid. If you get a chance to get out of here, you take it. You don't let anyone hold you back next time, okay? And you don't have enough food in your refrigerator for a full conversation. I just want you as far away from this bullshit as you can go. Yeah, I know. - Of course you do. You're a good kid. It's not your fault you were brought up in this fucking city. Oh, so you finally decide to knock? What, did you get lost on the way out, Willie? She's dead. What? My friend, she wanted to talk. And I just saw her a few hours ago and she wanted- - Slow down, what are you talking? - I went over there and. - Come sit down. Come sit down. The girl you saw me with at the department store, I just saw her a few hours ago, she wanted to talk. I went over and I went inside. And everything looked thrown around. It was a mess. That's when I saw her. She was all bruised and broken. I didn't even recognize her. They didn't even take anything, they just. I kept telling her that what she was doing would catch up to her eventually. But I meant some kind of STD or- - Whoa whoa, whoa whoa whoa. What did you mean catch up to her? What are you talking about? Juliette was a call girl. She was talking about some big client that had a lot of money, and. I guess he came over. Okay, look. What did the police say? I don't know. I left. Why did you leave? Nevermind that. That's not important right now. What's important is that you're all right. It's my fault. That night you found me, Juliette had told me that she thought that if I went out, and remembered to have fun. So I went out as her. I was supposed to be her that night. She said that it wasn't gonna be anything with sex, or anything like that. I was just gonna go to the party, and flirt, and be pretty, that's it. I was supposed to be her. And now, now she's dead. They came after her. They thought that she was me. And now they are gonna come after me. Hey no, No. That's not gonna happen. I'm not gonna let that happen, okay? Greg, what are you gonna do about it? Okay, well first of all, we're gonna figure out who it is. Is there anything that you can remember about the place that you were at? A doorknob, a mailbox, anything? No. I mean, I still have this. I wrote down the address to the party. You sure that this is it? Yeah. You're positive? Why? What's going on? Okay, look. I gotta go take care of something, all right? It's probably not safe for you to go back to your house tonight, so you're gonna stay here. But I have to step out right now. You stay here, I'll be back in a few hours. I don't want to be left alone. I know. But you're not gonna be alone for that long, okay? I have to go. Hey Billy, it's Greg. Wake up. We've got a big fucking problem, man. Hey, it's me. I was right. They fucking killed him. They killed him and they made him disappear. Yeah, I don't know, but that's what it seems like to me. Look, I can't go into that right now. I gotta go take care of something. Watch your ass. They might be after us. Hey we have to get you a gun, man. It's not gonna work out with that flash light. Yeah, then I can just shoot you. Hey that's pretty sad. Yeah, whatever, all right. Come on, let's go. Hey hey, you wanted to meet. Lets talk. We need to talk. Yeah, lets get out of here. You said you wanted to talk. Nah nah, lets go get coffee or something. Coffee shop? We can talk here. I don't have anything to eat. Okay. Oh hello. No wonder you were in such a hurry, huh? Whose this? Just a friend. Well, I'm Greg's other friend. I'm Billy. You know not friends like you are, probably. - All right, stop. - Okay It was nice to meat you, Billy. Yeah, nice to meet you too. Oh, I'm sorry. No that's okay. I'll see you later, okay? - Bye. - Bye. Not a fucking word. Nice. So, what's up with the girl? Nothing. She just spent the night. That's bullshit, man. I saw the way you two looked at each other. What's up, huh? You're not gonna tell me who she is? Nope. No? Just have to see for myself. Where did you get that? Notary Public, fancy stuff. Samantha Flores. Five foot one, 110 pounds. That's awesome, man. That's like perfect bouncing weight. - You're fucked with my head. - Gregory! Gregory! Give me that. So she lives in Boyle Heights? That's perfect, man. That's just like right around the corner. Very convenient, man. Very convenient. Yep. Are you gonna ride your bike to her place, or what? - I don't know, Billy. I don't trust them. You don't trust who? Mikey and John. I mean where did you find these guys, anyway? - Don't start on them. They're my guys, okay? They had my back all those years when you were not here. - All right, I'm just saying. They give me a bad feeling. This whole thing is giving me a bad feeling, okay? Lets just deal with this. So, where are we going, anyway? Jackie-D's. Jackie-D? He's just a driver. No, he's the driver. Somebody chased me down a dark, winding road at almost 100 an hour. The only person that can do that is Jackie. We can find Jackie, we can start getting some answers. Okay, okay. I'm going in first. I can handle it. You can handle? When was the last time you even held a gun? And even when you did, you never shot anybody. And you have? I'm not letting you go in first. You need backup, man. I can call my guys. What? Who, Mikey and John? - Yeah. - No, look. Our objective is to get in there, and to get some answers from this guy, not to beat him to a pulp. But you're not getting in first. So you just want to get into the door, John Rambo style? No. We should knock on the door, and have a decent conversation about this. Stay here, man. Where'd he hit you, man? Where'd he hit you? He didn't get me. He didn't get me. He drew on me, man. Why the hell are you on the ground, then? Asthma. Fuck you, man. Come on, we gotta get out of here. You want to get his gun? No, come on. What's up, Mike? What's up? You look like you've seen a ghost. What's going on? We got a problem, man. We have to talk. Greg is gonna get us killed. What the hell are you talking about? I just have this weird feeling, dude. There's been a lot of stuff happening. You're like clockwork. Figured you were running late, so. What the hell was that about? I'll tell you later. Things are getting out of hand, man. Yeah, no shit. Greg is targeting Biggie. What do you mean Greg is targeting Biggie? Greg and I walk into Jackster's. Keep your voice down. - Do you remember Tokey? - Yeah. Biggie's drug mule? Keep your fucking voice down. But you know him, right? Yeah, I know Tokey. So check this out. Greg and I goes to Jackster's. Greg shakes down Tokey, takes Biggie's drugs from him. And then he tells him to tell Biggie that if he wants his stuff back, he has to come and get them. What the fuck would he do that for? Greg told me oh, it had something to do with Tokey's tattoo. You know that big tattoo, the spider tattoo he has? What does that have to do with anything? I have no idea. So I think Greg is holding something close to his chest that he's not telling me about. And it's driving me nuts. I know the feeling. I feel like I'm getting tailed. I'm telling you, I can feel the rope getting tighter. And now to make things more interesting. Well, guess what? This morning, I walk over to Greg's place. And he tells me about, you know Lucky. And, I see this woman there that I've never seen before. Woman? Who the hell is she? I don't know, but you just bought her a cup of coffee. Well that's something to think about, huh? I'm sure you're aware your attendance these past few days has been atrocious. Yes ma'am. I've had some issues but, I've got them worked out now. I'm glad to hear it. I'd hate to add unemployment to your list of problems. Just make sure that your call times are shorter. Hey. You got here faster than I thought. This isn't how I like to have a reunion. Hey, hey hey hey. I believe you've got something of mine. Man oh man. You're lucky the old man likes you so much. That should have been a bullet to your head. What? You mean like the same way you popped Lucky? Is that you trying to get a confession? Wow. It's nice to know that after all these years, your balls haven't shrunk any. So you wanted to see me? Yeah. You got me. Now why am I here? I don't want to be looking over my shoulder my whole life. I want to settle this. Well well, I can't say I had anything to do with anything. But I like this settling things bit. Well, what do you think? You popped Lucky. Lucky fucked me over. But you got to remember why he was called Lucky. He's got a lot of enemies, Gregy. Yeah, but not like you. That's right, not like me. So, if it wasn't you then who else would it have been? Sorry, wait. Is that you trying to get me to say something? I mean I don't get it. What is it? You wouldn't be here if you didn't want something. You know me too well. I'm here because you owe me a rather large sum of money. What the fuck are you talking about? That bag Lucky lifted. A large part of that money belongs to me. That's between you and Lucky. Lucky owes me. You're Lucky's boy, right? That means you owe me. And I want it back, with interest. I don't have that kind of money. Yeah. I saw your fridge. You're gonna redo the safe job. How the fuck do about- - You're all just fuck ups. You owe me that. Mother fucker. We were working for you. That's right. You're working for me now. Yeah, and what if I say no? I want that money at the end of the week. And what about Billy? What about Billy? We do this job and he's out. He's done. There's people out there trying to kill you. You understand? You don't have any leverage. Now take my advice, my friendly advice. What happened to you, man? I woke up. Maybe you should look into it. I like to nap. Whatever, man. It's a deal? I'm not gonna do it. You should stop trying to play hard ass, because we both know you're not. Oh by the way, I bought you pastrami. That's just sad. So let me understand this. You want us to rob the same place that we just got ambushed? Are you out of your ever fucking, loving mind? Hey, even I have to admit. Going to Mr. OCD Security's place in the middle of the night just with you, that's just stupid. Well you don't have a lot of fucking options, do you Billy? Besides, you guys said this a fucking pushover job. As long as no one tries to kill us, we're gonna be okay. That's a pretty big what if. Well, it's a what if that we would have to deal with anyway, right? Well, as long as you don't leave me in the dark, I guess I'm fine with it. I don't think that you're gonna have to worry about that too much. Why is that? Because we're gonna rob him in broad daylight. You gotta be shitting me. - That's not gonna work, man. Broad daylight? What the fuck? It's the only way that we can make sure that no one's trying to ambush us. Look, let me talk to Biggie. Maybe Biggie will do us a solid on this. Yeah. Willie no offense, but you know better than I do, Biggie's not in the favor business. All right, man. Hey, you want to heist a house for brunch. I'll call John and Mikey, and the rest of my crew, man. We can pull this off. No, no. No one else. Hey, I know I'm repeating myself here, but we need backup. Greg, Greg, I'm getting too old for this fucking showdown shit. There's not gonna be a showdown. We're gonna do this smart, two cars. You take the surveillance. Willy, you take the safe. You guys are gonna be in and out before this guy gets back. It's broad daylight. I'm gonna have the opportunity to survey the entire area. At the first sight of any trouble, we split. So, now you're talking two cars. That's right. Well, I'm filling the second one with my old crew. Because I'm not going in there and winding up with my thumb up my ass, and my hand full of fucking jewelry. Yeah hey jewelry, man. There's a lot of valuable shit besides cash we need to carry, we need fucking bags, we need- - Hey, Billy? - Yeah? Are you fucking paying attention? This is our one get out of death free card. - All right. - Okay? Lets not fuck it up by trying to get some jewelry. I'd rather stay off the bottom of the Pacific. - All right. - I don't swim good. So, I figure since he's forcing us to do this job. If something happens, we can give him a call, and he'll send over the calvary. Right? Willie? You can't reach Biggie during a heist. But what if it's an emergency? Look. You got fuck all. Biggie's not gonna pick up the phone in the middle of a heist. He sits in his office, he has a bottle of wine, and waits to the heat blows over. You got jack shit. Well, ain't this a fine fucking plate of bullshit. Yeah well, whatever it is, it's our only option, so we better get cracking. What are you doing here this time of night? Look, I have a lot of stuff going on right now. I don't want to get you caught up in it, so lets just. We've been coming to the same watering hole for months now, so we're practically family. I just had one of the best nights of my life tonight. That's a good thing. And after it was over, I had a momentary laps of memory and, I tried to call my friend Juliette to tell her all about it. Juliette's the one with the pants? Yeah. She's dead. I'm, I'm sorry. How, how are you taking it? As one would expect. And I know who killed her. What did the police say? There's nothing to talk about with this. You said you know who killed her. It's locked in my memory. I don't remember anything from that night. So I sit here and I jot, and jot, and jot trying to remember anything. But nothing comes up. It's just, it's like it belongs to a crazy person or something. Can I look at? Why? There's no point. Let me see it. You mind? What is the spider? That's the problem. I don't know. Everything just comes up in flashes. Black hat, green bag, blood. Wasn't your fault. Juliette was always there for me when I needed someone. And the one time that she needed me, I wasn't there. And if I could just remember this one thing in my life, she would probably still be alive right now. Sam, don't do that. I know. I've got to go. I'm sorry. I'll walk with you. Okay. So if you lost your memory, what's the last thing that you remember? Juliette hugging me. I don't want to talk about it, I'm sorry. It's all right. You said that tonight was a good night. What made it so special? You ever meet somebody, and without saying a word you felt something? Once. Tell me about him. You don't want to hear about him. I wouldn't have asked, if I didn't want to hear. Come on, tell me. Okay, fine. I'll tell you this one thing about him. He told me how he got this tattoo on his hand, and his friend has one too. When they were kids, his friend always got picked on a lot. And he would always come in and kick ass, and defend him I guess. Sounds like a good friend. Yeah. So before he left town, they got the same tattoo. This is my place. You know what the tattoo meant? What? Brother. Thanks for walking me home. I really appreciate it. Of course. I'm sorry I, I'm sorry I was a little bit melodramatic tonight. - Don't be silly. You kept me company. Good night, Mike. Good night. Hey, Sam? Sam? Hey look, I know we've only known each other for a couple of months now but, I want you to know that I'm here for you. Thanks Mike, but it's late. No wait, hey I just want to let you know that I'm lucky to have met you. You're a good person, and I do care. I don't want you to get hurt. Mike, I know you mean well. But I don't think that it's a good time right now. Then, when would be a good time? I don't know. Look, I'm not asking for you to fall in love with me or anything, all right. I'm just asking you to trust me. Can you do that? Can you do that? Yes. Are you good? - Are you okay? - Yeah. Come on, we're getting the fuck out of here. Get up. Are you okay? No, Mike. I'm far from okay. You looked like you knew who the guy was. He was following me. I thought that I was paranoid. I don't know! Was the guy with the tattoo with you the night that you witnessed the murder? Yes. He was the one who saved my life. Jesus fucking. I never told you anything. Mike, were you following me? - No, I wasn't following you. You looked like you were- - Don't like to me. What is going on? I have no idea what's going on. The fuck, I- - Yes you do. Sam. Where are you taking me? Somewhere safe. Greg. I need to see Greg. Take me to him. Are you sure that you can trust him right now? Right now, he's the only one I can trust. I'm fine. I'm fine. Are you okay? Tell me everything that happened, beginning to end. I remember walking in the house and, as soon as I got there, the guy got really frisky. And I just got really scared, and I pushed him off, and he got really angry. And the next thing I remember, I was in the bathroom, and there is blood everywhere and, I remember picking up a gun and shooting over and over again. There's gotta be something else, something that you overlooked. But that's all I remember. I mean, besides the spider and the green bag. The bag. What happened to the bag? What did you do with the bag? What are you talking about? You just said that there was a bag. What did you do with it? I just told you everything that I can remember, Greg. Why are you talking to me like this? I don't like your tone right now. Because it doesn't make any sense, Samantha. What doesn't make any sense? The whole thing! You, me, the whole fucking thing! Look, I told you everything that I can remember. And you, for all I know, I could have been raped by that guy. He didn't rape you. How do you even know that? Because I knew him. Because I knew him, that's how. He wouldn't do that. You knew this entire time? No wonder when I gave you that address, you ran out of there like a bat out of hell. I thought that you were trying to help me, Greg. Are you kidding? That's all that I've been trying to do. I don't want to hear it. How do I believe anything that comes out of your mouth at this point? What were you even doing there that night to begin with? If I can explain that- - No, I don't want to hear it. It will just be another line of bullshit from you at this point. Were those guys even after me? Birdie, look. My goddamned name is Samantha. Maybe if you'd step outside of your own self pity for five seconds, you'd see that not everybody's out to get you. All right? You're not the only one that's lost somebody. I mean I'm hurting here. I'm fucking. How did you get this? That's a long story. I've got time. A long time ago, my boys and I, we were stupid. Wanted to be big shots, you know kid shit. Trusted the wrong people, listened to this guy sell us on this job that was supposed to take us to the next level. Bit off more than we could chew. I got shot. A couple of guys didn't even make it back. I moved on after that but apparently no one else did. They're still doing the same stupid shit. I have money from my old job. We can leave here, me and you. No, that wouldn't work. Why not? Because I was the only one to leave last time. It can't be like that again. It just can't. It doesn't matter what happens, just as long as we're together, okay? I don't want you mixed up in this, Birdie. You already broke your promise with that one. I wonder what happened with that bag, anyway. Yeah. Who took it, do you think? Well it wasn't Biggie. And Jackie's dead so, he can't have it. And I have no idea who's after us. The people that killed Juliette, they had torn her place up, like they were looking for something. And messed my place up too. I don't know. Yeah. Holy shit, yeah. I gotta call Billy. Hey Billy, it's me. Hey look, we don't have to do the job. I know where the money is. Hey, hey hey. Slow down, slow down. Where are you? I can't explain that right now. Look, I need you to get down to the hotel on Fifth and Grand, okay? Samantha's here. I need you to look after her. I'll explain later. Greg? Let's go. Where are you going? I'm going to get that bag. Don't worry, okay? Billy's gonna be here. He'll take care of you, all right? I'll be back. Greg. I know what the symbol was. I've got more of my memory back. The spider symbol, it was a tattoo. It was a Chinese symbol just like yours. Billy was the one that was at the house that night. Billy is the one that killed your friend. Greg, he's here. Hey Sammy. How you doing? Greg sent me to check up on you. He was talking like a madman. Hey, you know where he is? Yeah, it's just like Greg to run around like a chicken with his head cut off. Yeah, just like him. Yeah, tell me about it. You should have seen him when we were kids. What's up with you? Why are you so nervous? Is everything okay? Yeah. So you remember? Fuck. Does he know? Does he know? I just need to know where he is. Where is he? Hey. Breathe, come on. Breathe. Hey hey, look at me, look at me. Don't make this harder on yourself, okay? Like what you did to Juliette? They just got carried away, okay? That's what happened. That doesn't mean that it has to happen to you. All I need to know is where to find him. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Okay? Look. Look at me, look at me. Just tell me the place, and save yourself. Just save yourself. Save yourself. I'm not a backstabbing snake like you. You don't know what you're fucking talking about! You don't know what you're fucking talking about! Okay. Hold on. Where is he? I asked you a question. Now, let's try that again. Where is he? It was Billy. I mean it was John on the phone, but it was Billy. Who would thought that that prick had it in him? You got the money? If you got the money, maybe I can spread it around. I could talk to a couple of people. No. The only reason why she's alive right now is because I have that bag. They need me. So what are you gonna do? Kill Biggie, and wipe our debts clean. Don't even fucking joke like that. Well, then I have to do the next best thing. I gotta get her back. And you expect me to believe that you're just gonna let Billy get away with all this? You know this is suicide, right? You know he's gonna have his best guys over there watching her? Well, you seem to have your mind all made up. So why and I here? Because I'm gonna need a favor. I hope you know what you're doing. You're on your own, kid. Jesus. I knew they were desperate, I didn't think that they'd go this far. Where is Greg? You shouldn't be worried about Greg, you should be worried about yourself. Don't hand me that. Where is he? He's tying up loose ends. What the hell is that supposed to mean? It means he's taking care of some shit we should have a long time ago. He's putting an end to this whole thing. Where are you going? To settle something on my own. And you won't let me have that same chance? Sam, come here. These are dangerous people. I mean look what they've done to you already. How do you think this is gonna end? This is enough money to get out of this shitty city and never look back, take it. I'm not leaving. I'm sticking through this till the end. Reality is, I don't know if any one of us is gonna make it out of this alive. You don't think I know that already? The past few days have been an absolute nightmare. But I've never felt more alive than I have now. And Greg is part of that reason. And not you or anybody is gonna take that from me. I'm going with you. All right. Let's go. What is this? Where's Greg? He couldn't make it. I'm filling in. Yeah? Well I hope that we don't run into trouble like last time. Someone got Samantha. Son of a bitch. Was it John? Yeah, I suppose since they didn't get in on the action, they're gonna try to take it all. What the hell is that? It wasn't John, Billy. It was you. What the fuck are you talking about? Before you grabbed her from the hotel, she made one last call. She remembered who killed Lucky. All right, you've got me, Mike. Does Greg know? Yeah, he knows. And he doesn't show up? What the fuck happened to you, Billy? My back was against the wall. I did what I had to do. You had to kill Lucky? So you fuck over your friends for some fucking money! So fuck you! I'm out! No you're not. You already have the money. This just covers what I owe Biggie. It's not enough. Take the bag, get the score, leave me the fuck alone. I'm going home. I can't let you do that, Mike. We need three guys to finish the job, not two. I need you on this. No you don't. You drive, and we'll let the girl go, okay? I'll get my money and we'll all go our separate ways. And if I don't? Then guess what. You'd shoot me in the back, Billy? I need that money, Mike. I can't help you. Well then I'm sorry that it has to end. Relax. You win. Fuck, Billy! This is not on me, Mike. This is not on me. Put your gun down. Or what, you're gonna shoot me? It wouldn't be the first time. It's over, Billy. Sam. What are you doing? I can't. Samantha, it's over. Let's go. How do you know he won't come back and kill us? - Mikey, tell her I wouldn't- - Shut the fuck up. Juliette! Look what he did to me! Sam, if you do this, there's no going back. All right, we're scum, our hands are already dirty. But you still have a chance to get the fuck out of this place. Sammy? Sam? We have to get you to a hospital. I'm okay, I'm all right. You weren't even close. Sammy, take the bag. Take the bag and get out of here. What about you? You want to know where he is? He left town with me. He's at my place. Go. Make it count. Hey, Billy. Fuck me. Well, aren't you risky? So I take it that you don't have my money. I take it no one heard a thing when you came in. You've got everyone on the other side of town, chasing their own ass. Nice. Maybe you're not that rusty after all. What's that? For revenge? So I'm supposed to believe now that, that stick up kid turned rocker, turned into a trigger man, is that it? So are you gonna nurse that gun, or shoot it? I thought so. I'll tell you what? Call me when you have something to say. Stop wasting my time. Sit down. My man. Tell me, tell me, tell me how. How long it took you in the hallway figuring you ain't got the balls to do that? How's your stomach? See most people, they throw up the first time. Now, I didn't. I'm special. Shut the fuck up. I don't get you, man. I didn't even kill Lucky. Yet, here we are. Tell me something. Is there a single person in this town that you haven't poisoned in one way or another? It wasn't my fucking fault that Billy didn't pay his bills. He knew the rules. Right. Right, right right, right right. He did know the rules. You're just a businessman. Just a businessman, you're right. You're innocent in all of this. - Killing Lucky? You're goddamned right. You are not in control here. I didn't put the rope around their neck. No, you just gave them enough rope to hang themselves with, right? So that's it, huh? That's the reason that you're bleeding all over my fucking expensive furniture? Is that it? It's like a seed in my mind. At first I was just happy to be out, to be alive. It just kept nagging at me, these questions. Question after question. Why? Why? Is it better to kill me, is that it? Is that it? If I let you go, then I have to look over my shoulder for the rest of my life. And Sam, that girl. She doesn't deserve that. I've already done enough damage. But I could let you go. You must be desperate. Besides, then I'd still have to live with the fact that you're still out there somewhere, feeding off of the souls of desperate people, people like Lucky, like Billy, like me. No. This ends today. Because the whole time I've been asking myself the wrong questions. This whole time I've been asking myself why when I should- Who? I should have asked myself who. It was always you. It was the only way. Greg. If you ever come back here again, I have to kill you. When I was a little girl, my grandmother used to take me to the beach almost every weekend. And she would feed the pigeons. And I remember I would always close my eyes and run through them as hard as I could, as fast as I could. I always thought that if I, if I tried hard enough, I could fly away with them. Come on, we're getting ready to have a good time. That's right. Move your feet.
