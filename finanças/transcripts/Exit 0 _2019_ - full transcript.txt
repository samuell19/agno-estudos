-=Sync&Corrected by Misiek666=- - Just pick, that one. What about now? Stop, go back two. No. - Okay, can you stop stressing? - Just pick one. I'm not the one stressing. - Pretty sure I see some gray hairs up in that bird's nest of yours. - You wanna see a picture? That's me when I was five. That's my mom and my dad. That's where we're going. It's nice, right? - How you feelin', baby? - I feel good. - How far are we? - About 20 miles. - Really? Come on, again with those things? No, we're not doing that. - Who's that? Who's that guy? - Stop. - Who's, what's his name? Sean? - Stop. - Oh is that Carly's boyfriend? How are they doin'? Is she still mad at him for what he did? - It's none of your business. - So who are these people? - God, just checking my messages, calm down. - How many messages do you have? Who's that guy? - Stop! - Who is that guy? - You're being an asshole, stop. - You know it was a good thing when I dropped my phone in the urinal that time. It was the universe telling me that no more phones. Should never got it fixed. - You know they do come in handy, right? - Oh yeah, they come in handy, so handy. - In case of emergencies, you know, if your car breaks down. - For you, there seems to be an emergency for like every 10 minutes, six minute blocks of 10. Did you text your mom I said hello? - Yes. - Text her right now, tell her I said hello. - She said hello back already. - I wanna see you text her. I wanna see. - No, I'll do it later. - Right, let me see. - Really. Let's just find a rest stop, go pee and get to the place. How about that? - Bathroom's that way. - Cool, I think I'm gonna go call my mom, okay? - Okay. - What's wrong? - Which way did that car go? The guy that came out like two, three seconds before me. This was his car. Where, they beam him up? What, this makes no sense. - Baby I didn't see a guy. I mean I was on my phone. So maybe I missed him, I don't know. - That is so weird. - Don't worry about it, let's go. Come back to the car. - Wait a minute. No, stop, stop. Well you were standing there. Which way did he go? - I don't know, what did he look like? - The black car, when we pulled in, there was a black car in here. - I didn't see a black car. I probably just missed it 'cause I was on my phone. Don't worry about it, let's go, come on. - Oh so you admit that you were on your phone. That's the problem. - Yes, I admit that I was on my phone, Billy. - Yeah, let's. Hi, my name's Lisa Text. - Wow, you're gonna do this again? - Got your head in the phone. - Seriously, let's go. - You're texting. You can't even see a car - Okay Billy. - that's two feet in front of you. 'Cause you're texting. I'm texting my mom, I'm texting my sister. I'm texting, texting, texting. Texting. That's why you don't drive, that's why. This is a big problem between the both of us right now. - It's supposed to rain all weekend. - It's sunny out now. Why don't you keep it upbeat? How about that? It's been here since I was six years old, exactly in the same spot. It's genuine cedar wood. See how smooth that second hand moves? - Come on now let's go check in, babe. Let's go, keep going. - Mhmm, uh huh. Mhmmm. - So are you winning? - Certainly not. So are you checking in? - Yes we are indeed. - Well that's great. For the weekend or for a week? - Weekend. - Uh huh. - This is Lisa. - Hi Lisa. - I'm Billy. Yeah I used to come here when I was a kid. - Is that right? - Yeah. - Do you have your driver's license with you? Ah. Billy Curtis, hmm. - Yeah. - Brooklyn, New York, yes. So that's quite a jog down here. What's the occasion? - Well, there's no occasion. You know, we're trying to get away from the city. - Uh huh. - Come here, breathe fresh air and, - And? - And here we are. - Well, great. And I'm Frederick, not Fred. I am the innkeeper and it's very nice to meet both of you. - Nice to meet you too. - Good to meet you too. - So how long have you been the innkeeper here, Frederick? - Hmm, wow. It's 30 years, maybe a little longer. Would you have a credit card with you? - Yes. - Oh, thank you. It will be encrypted, not to worry. Okay good. Now checkout will be 11 a.m. on Monday. And if you need anything, by all means just buzz down here to the front desk and usually be myself or Victor the night manager. - Victor, okay. - Yes, and I have you in room two. - Cool. - Two flights up, down the hall, you might remember from your youth. - No, I mean I wouldn't remember. I know that I came here when I was a kid. I just know that my parents took me here, here and the Elson Inn. - Ah, the Elson Inn. Yes, they tore it down a few years ago. It was in terrible condition. And it was the oldest inn on the island. - I hate it when they tear down those old places. - Yeah well that's the charm of this town, is it? They usually don't tear down old landmarks. They do the very best they can to restore them, but, time, it does take its toll. - Yeah. - So we don't have many guests this weekend. Not yet, you know, the weekend is young. But you never know, things might just pick up. You never know what tomorrow will bring. And I hope you have a very, very, - Hup, thank you. - Here it is. Ah, there you are, pleasant stay. - Thank you. - Thank you. - Two flights up, down the hall. - Wonderful. - Welcome to use the phone. - So wonderful to meet you. - Thanks. - That was weird. - Well it's weird, everything's weird. Everything. The rest stop's weird, car ride's weird. - No, the whole thing I guess, I just hope we have a nice stay. - What do you mean the whole thing? The whole thing? What's wrong, what do you mean? What happened to having a great time? - Are you sure we have the right place? - No, we got the wrong place, can't you see? It's shabby chic. You know, you're just high maintenance, see. It's 145 years old. You're just very used to what you're used to and anything that's out of the ordinary is a problem. Towels on the floor. Maybe the maid has off. - You think? - Are you mad at me because I told you that there'd be wifi? - No. - Is this all right? - Yeah. It's good to get out of town. It's a good change of scenery. And I really liked seeing all the trees on the drive down here. - And you gotta come with me in the fall so you can see all the pretty colors. - You know what I think? I think that you miss being down here. - City burns me out, man. City burns me out. You handle city better than I do. - I don't know about that. - Yeah? - Maybe just hide it better than you. - Yeah I'm more like plaid, stripes and wool. And you're more satin and silk, black. - That's me, you nailed it. - Okay, that was odd. - What? - I was just about to pack the drawer. It was open when we came in here. And now it's closed. I was emptying my suitcase, loading up the drawer and I turned around and it was closed. - You know what I think? I think that you need something to eat. - No, it has nothing to do with me needing something to eat. The drawer was open. I turn around, now it's closed. - Okay so you're saying that that thing just closed on its own? - Yeah, maybe. I'm going for a walk. - You want me to join you? - No. - Get out of here, Billy. - That happens all the time. It falls. - Oh. I'm Billy from down the hall. - Hey, Billy from down the hall. Wait, wait, wait, Billy, Billy, Billy. Come and have a drink with me. Come here. I hate drinking alone. - I'm just good, thank you. - No. What should we drink to? - Strangers. - I'll drink to strangers. - You a writer? - Yeah. I was. I suppose. I wrote this. 30 years ago in this room. It's an old book. Well I'm back here. Maybe I can write another one. Come here, give me. Give it back. You don't need. - You wrote that 30 years ago? - Yeah. Right in this room and with that typewriter. - That's 1986. - 1986, yeah. Probably when you were how old? - Six. - Long time ago, huh? - Yeah. - I think I'm back here so I could maybe tap in whatever that magic was. Hell, maybe you're part of the magic. What are you doing here? - I'm here with my girlfriend. - Yeah? What's her name? - Lisa. - Lisa? Are you in love? - I don't know. - You don't know? Love is a beautiful thing. Well you'll have to bring Lisa back up and have a drink with me. Will you do that? - That's a possibility. Wow, that just really hit me. - Are you okay? - Yeah. I just gotta get back to my girlfriend. I'm gonna head out. But thanks for inviting me into your place, appreciate that, and the drink. - Nice meeting you, Billy. - Nice meeting you too. - Come back, all right? With Lisa though. Only with Lisa. - Everything all right? - Yeah. It's good. That guy was weird. - What's weird? - This writer, I met this writer down the hallway. He's really strange. - Hmm. - He like invited me to his room. And he like made me a drink and he's talking. It's really strange. - Baby, is that what you're wearing to dinner? - Yes. - Well hey, I'm really, really hungry so let's go eat soon, okay? What are you doing, stop. Get ready. - I am ready. Did you leave the drawer open? - Ugh, again with the drawer? - Hey Frederick. - Evening, Billy. - Your grandfather clock is wrong. - What do you mean? It says 7:15. So it must be 7:15. Nah, it can't be 7:15. - But it's never been wrong in 20 years. My Rolex says 6:15. - Oh that may be a Rolex, Billy, but that's an Imperial and I have been watching it for, it's impossible. - Frederick. - They don't break. - Frederick, it's a Rolex. Rolexes are never wrong. - Well maybe it needs to be reset. - No, it doesn't. - Where are you going with this, Billy? - I'm not going anywhere with it. I'm just saying, this, my Rolex says 6:15. - Okay. - I was only there for two hours. - So what's the point? - The grandfather clock is wrong. Maybe you should reset it. - Hi Lisa, Billy and I were just talking about time. - Were we up there for two hours? No, of course not. He's trying to tell me that it's 7:15. But my Rolex says 6:15. Who's right? - No that says 7:15. - And Mr. Curtis? - No it's not. My watch also says 7:15. Yup, 7:15. Well thank you so much, Frederick. We appreciate that. Baby, let's go. - May I make a suggestion? - Absolutely. - There's a lovely restaurant just about two blocks from here, the Lambs Head. - What a name. - Yes. Good name, good food. - Thank you, Frederick. - Enjoy, night. - We will, thank you so much. - Hmm. - This is a nice place. What's going on in that head of yours? - I feel a little weird. - Okay. Why do you feel weird? - Ever since that incident, I just, well. - Billy what? - I feel weird. - Okay, okay. Which incident? - At the rest stop. With that guy and then at the hotel room with the drawer. And now this thing with the watch. Look. When you were getting ready, I came down the stairs and I was waiting for you so I admired the grandfather clock. And I noticed, oh look it says 7:15. And I noticed that my watch says 6:15. This is a fucking Rolex. That's what we were talking about, Frederick and I. And then you come down, and, I mean you know how much pride I have in this watch. And you contradicted me in front of the stranger. I couldn't believe it. You like totally threw me under the bus. I mean I didn't feel like you had my back. I just feel like that I've been telling you all these things that I feel like that are happening to me and you don't believe me and you think I'm crazy. I feel like I'm alone. I don't feel like we're a team, I don't feel like we're partners in crime. I feel alone. - You're not crazy. I don't think you're crazy. Listen, look at me. I know that's your father's watch and it means a lot to you. And Billy, I have your back, I promise. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for not having your back earlier. - No I mean, I get a little nutty. - No, no. - I get nutty too. I understand and I'm sorry. - Everybody gets nutty. I get nutty, you get nutty. Who cares, we all get nutty. We're human beings, we're crazy. Why don't we just have a really romantic weekend together? What, why are you laughing? - Where you going? I should just ask her. Ask her nicely. And if she gets defensive, then you know there's something up. Just ask her. Say, is that your mom you're talking to? Just ask her. - Yes? - What are you doing in there? - I'm taking my bath. - Yeah I know, but why, why did you bring the phone? - Because I need to check my text messages. - Sounds like my mother. Come on, man! What the fuck! - He's out for a nice Saturday night stroll. You throw like a girl. - What, he just fucking wave at me? - Looks like he gave you the bird. Take that shit? There's our little friend, come here. Such a cute little car. Come on. Move, motherfucker! Hand me a beer, man. Hand me another fucking beer, man. Ah yeah, there you go. - Yeah? Wait, wait, here we go, here we go, what we got? Is he gonna get out the car? See if he gets down the fucking car. What you do, come on, motherfucker. Is he gonna get out? - What's wrong, asshole? - He just made a bad mistake. - Fucking piece of shit! Fucking on me! - Oh, he's not gonna like that. - Come on, let's get him right now. Ready, come on. Oh we're gonna follow him. See that fucking girl he had in the car? See that fucking woman? Oh man! - Let's go get some. - Yeah! That fucking woman. I'm gonna fuck her and make him watch. - Come here! Come here! She likes it! She likes it. Yeah, yeah. Come here, come here. Like that? Get it! - The fuck is that?! The fuck is that? What the fuck is this? What the fuck? - Is everything all right out there? Is everything all right? - Yeah. What the fuck? - Miss me? What are you doing? - I have something in my eye. - You're acting weird again. - Okay, I'm a little tired. I can't do this right now. - It's okay, it's okay. It's okay baby, we got a whole weekend, okay? Did you hear that? Billy, can you go check on the sound? - Yeah. Lisa. Fucking phone! - Yes, yes, I know that, Mrs. Douglas. Yeah it's 135 for the night during the week and then the price changes on the weekend. And then you're coming... - I need to use the phone for a bit. I need to use the phone. - Just a minute, please. - I need to make a phone call. - Okay, yeah okay. Thank you and please, just let me know. Bye. It's not even 9:30 a.m. and the phone is ringing off - I need to use the phone. - and I can't seem to please anybody. Yeah you know what... - Can I use the phone? - Yes, I said you could. - Okay. Thank you. - Now who do you wanna call? - I'm calling the police. - What, what? My goodness, why are you calling the police? - 'Cause it's a personal matter, Frederick. - No I think I should know. Don't you think I should know what's going on here? Are you having them come here? - And I'm staying at the Doctor's Inn and I need a detective to come by. No, it's not an emergency but it's extremely important. I need a detective to come over to Doctor's Inn right away 'cause I have something that I need to show him. It's confidential. Okay, thank you. - Now is there something I do to help? - I'm gonna be out on the front porch. Detective? - Yeah, yeah, Detective Mueller. Billy Curtis? - Billy Curtis. I called you. - What can I help you with? - Well I found something that's very disturbing. - What is it? - It's a videotape and I just don't know what to make of it. I don't know if it's real or if it's not. It's very disturbing. - Okay, all right. Let me take a little information before we step inside, huh? - Sure. - You from this area, Billy? - No, I'm from New York. I'm just here for the weekend with my girlfriend. - She inside? - No, she's at a cafe. - And when did you find this tape? - Last night in my room, after dinner. - Okay. - What's on the tape? - I'd rather show you. - Sure. Let's take a look. - Okay. It's gone. No I don't understand. I put it right here, I put it in here before. I don't understand this. I put it right in there. - Billy, Billy, relax. Maybe you put it somewhere else. Another drawer maybe? - I put it here. - Okay, well listen. Tell me exactly what was on this tape. - A guy and a girl and there was men, two men that were chasing them. And they were videotaping them. And this altercation occurred and then it continued into this room with the couple, and they busted the door down and they killed them. They killed them. - They killed them, huh? - Yeah. - And you're sure about that? - Oh, yeah, I'm sure about it. Well they didn't kill them. It was the guy with the video camera just taped it. The other guy killed them. - Okay. How did he kill them? - With a knife. - And you're certain about that? - Detective, I wouldn't call you over here if I didn't see with my own eyes. I wouldn't waste your time. And believe me I'd much rather be over with my girlfriend having a coffee right now. Does this ring a bell? - No, not really. And you're sure it was here? - Oh yeah it was in this room. The door, the number on the door, you could see it. - These two guys in the videotape. What'd they look like? - The guy shooting it, I didn't see much of him. But the other guy, the guy who did the killing, he had this, he was in the shadows. - Okay, okay, okay. Where exactly did you find this tape? - Under the bed. - Under the bed? - Yeah, my girlfriend was taking a bath then I was gonna smoke a cigarette then I dropped the matches. And I went to pick them up and then there it was. Just under the bed. - Did you show your girlfriend? - No. - Why not? - Because it was horrific and I didn't want to scare her. - Look, Billy. There's not much more I can do until I see this tape. - No, I understand that but this doesn't ring a bell, or it's not familiar? A murdered couple, you've never heard that before? - I can't say that it does. I mean, this is a small resort town. We got three detectives, uniformed police. There's not a lot of crime, you know. I mean in the summers we got kids that are getting rowdy in the clubs, you know, breaking up fights, things like that. There's a car or a house that gets broken into but other than that it's a really quiet town. - So no murders? - No, no murders. I mean, not that I'm aware of. I've only been in this precinct a very short time. But anyhow. Here's my card. If you find the videotape, just let me know. - Okay. I'm sorry I had you come here and waste your time, Detective. I appreciate it. - You didn't waste my time. Try to enjoy the rest of your stay. - I'll try. - No, I'm happy to hold a reservation for 48 hours. No, the pleasure's always mine. Goodbye. Ah, Billy. I hope everything's all right. - No, it's not all right. - What's the problem? - Well. There's a tape that's missing from my room. - A tape? - A video tape. So what about it? - I found a video tape in my room. And now it's gone missing. - Missing? - Yes. - Well I don't know how to help you. It's barely 10 a.m. No one's been in your room. - No one has come in my room? - No. - No one? - No, of course it's... - Not even a maid? - We have a maid, it's Peggy, but she doesn't come too much later till after checkout time. And even after that, she changes the linen and brings fresh towels, yes, but she won't be over quite some time. Billy, I'm sorry, I don't think I can help you. - Am I late? It's 10:30, where were you? - Why don't you give me a break and let's have some fun? - Yay, I'm all for fun. - Let's have a good time, you know? What do you wanna do? - I don't know, Billy. You're the tour guide, you tell me. What are we gonna do? - I say we take a ride into town and then hot chocolate and then we'll go to the lighthouse. - Okay. - Where are you going? - We have just taken 228 steps to get up here. The lighthouse is a total of 171 feet. Now some of you may know of the SS Atlantis but if you look far enough to the south, you'll spot a piece of the hull from the obscure Sir Edmond James which fell victim to a shipwreck here in 1899. It was on its way to China carrying freight when it ran into a dense fog which ultimately led to its demise. - Wow. Were there any survivors? - As a matter of fact, yes. The Captain, Edward Louis was the only survivor. The rest of his crew, nine men total, met their fate that night. - Wow. What happened to the Captain? - Funny you mentioned. He swam ashore and was nursed back to health at the Doctor's Inn which was the first place he stumbled upon on that rainy night. A few years later, he became the innkeeper there. - Great, we're staying at the Doctor's Inn. - Well, it's a lovely place. But it certainly has a history. - What kind of history? - Some say there are some haunted areas in town, the Doctor's Inn being one of them. - Are there any others? - Oh there are several. There's a ghost tour if you're interested. - Oh god, I love ghost tours. - No, I don't wanna, no. I'm not gonna go on a ghost tour. - I'm gonna keep this. - I don't think so. I don't wanna go to a ghost tour. Thanks for showing us the lighthouse. - My pleasure. - You must really love it to walk up all those stairs. - Yeah. I'm a real people person. Plus the stairs give me a good workout. - So how long you've been doing this for? - Let's see. I've been here part time after I got out of the service in 1981. - What, the Navy? - That's right. I've had some odd jobs over the years but I've been here full time since 1995. - That's a long time. Let me ask you, did you really believe in this ghost stuff, like? Is the Doctor's Inn really haunted? - It's folklore. It's also part of the tour. Helps the economy. People like that sort of thing. - That makes sense. My parents used to bring me there when I was little. - So beautiful. Charles, are there any bathrooms up here? - Oh, sure, let me take you down there. - Okay. - Watch your step. So how long will you be staying at the Doctor's Inn? - Like three days. We just got here yesterday. Ooh, we got new towels, baby. - Oh, I love fresh towels. - I am going to take a bath. - No, no, take a shower. Take a bath later. Just rinse off, no ordeal. - Fine. Hey baby, where are we gonna go eat? - I feel like seafood. - Okay. - I'll be back. - Billy. - Detective, I got the tape! I got the tape. - Hey listen, Billy. I'm done for the day. I'm just about to leave, okay? - It's the tape. - It's after five. - Please. This is the tape, please. - All right, all right, come on in. So, where'd you find the tape? - It popped up. I'm telling you Detective, it popped up. - Popped up, huh? - Right in the dresser drawer. I'm telling you, there's a lot of weird stuff going on right now, Detective. - Okay, well let's have a look. What's going on, where's the picture? - Press forward. - I'm fast forwarding it. - Press play. - Look. I'm pressing rewind, fast forward. - I don't know. I'm not making it up, Detective. - I'm pressing play. This is crazy, Billy. - I know. I put it on there, I saw the tape, I saw with my own eyes. Why would I make it up? I don't know, I don't know. - Just take it easy, okay? Tell me again what happened. - I picked up my girlfriend at the cafe, we went down to, we walked around the town, we went to the lighthouse. We came back to the hotel. We talked about getting dinner, go for a drive. She went and took a bath, I opened up the drawer and there it was. The tape was just sitting right there. - Hmm. Are you suggesting that someone's playing tricks on you? - Personally, maybe, I don't know. It's the same tape. - Really? How do you know it's the same tape? Did you look at it before coming here? - No I didn't. - Hmm. Tell me something. Does your girlfriend know anything about this? - No, I'm the only one who knows about this. - Are you sure? - Yeah. - Is your girlfriend back at the inn? - Yes. - Jack? - Detective. - Hey, just hold on a second. Hey Jack, do me a favor. Could you go to the Doctor's Inn and pick up a Lisa, - Morris. - Lisa Morris. She's on the second floor, room two. Yeah, that's right. Yes, right away, thanks. Lisa? I'm Detective Mueller. - Nice to meet you. - Thanks for coming. - Is Billy okay? - Yeah, he's all right. Can I get you some coffee? - No, I'm good, thank you. - Okay. Yeah, he's fine, he's in the next room. - Okay. What's this about? - Well, your boyfriend called me this morning and he told me he found a videotape. You know anything about this? - No. - Okay, well, things he told me on this videotape are pretty gruesome. Evidently, a couple gets killed. And it's like a home movie, two guys filming it. I mean he was very detailed with what he told me and it sounded very believable. He's pretty shaken up. He brought the tape over just as I was about to leave for the day, and, when we popped the tape in, there was nothing on there. It's completely blank. - That's crazy. - Yeah, I'll say. Anyhow, that's why I asked you to come here. Lisa, how long have you been dating? - Like a little less than a year. - And how did you meet? - We had mutual friends that worked at a bar together in our neighborhood. - And then you started dating? - Yeah, pretty much. - Okay. Do you know anything about his background? - Not much. I just know that his parents died when he was really young. - Uh huh. - And he hadn't been back since. This meant a lot to him. It was rough. You know, we don't get out of the city much. - I see. Do you know how his parents died? - No, I don't. Again, he doesn't really say much. I just know that it was, I just know that it was really really painful for him. - Any idea who raised him? - I think his aunt. Again, he doesn't say much. Just bits and pieces, you know? - Hmm. Is he on medication? I have to ask. - Yes, he is. But I don't know the name of it, though. - Oh, man. This is a tough one, Lisa. I mean, He's convinced he saw people getting killed on this tape. And I mean, and I've got the tape right here and it's completely blank. And I don't know what to do. I don't know if he thinks he saw something or maybe somebody's trying to play tricks on him or something. Listen, I'm gonna release him to you. But at this point, there's nothing more I can do. - He's a good guy. - I know he's a good guy. But there's nothing more I can do here. I would suggest just maybe having him see a therapist. - Can I get you guys any dessert tonight? - I think we're good, thank you. - Get this out of your way. - Yeah. - Thank you. - I'm sorry you went through all that. - I'm sorry I put you through all that. - I just want you to open up to me. You scared the shit out of me. - I'm gonna go to the bathroom. I'm gonna get us another bottle of wine to go. - I'm gonna call my mom. - Okay. - I just wanted to say hi and see how you're doing. You're good? Okay, good. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Okay cool. Love you. Oh you scared the shit out of me. - How's your mom? - She's good. She said she says hi. - Some wine. - Good. Hey baby, I gotta pee. - Okay, go, go ahead, pee. - Be right back, okay? - I'll be in the car. - Okay, cool. Shit. I think I left my phone at the restaurant. - What? - I think I left my phone at the restaurant. - Did you find a cellphone? - I don't know, just have a look. Is this yours? - Oh thank you. - You're welcome. - Charles, right? - Hey there, yeah. - Billy, it was at the lighthouse. - You and your girlfriend, right? - Yeah. - Where's your gal? - She's back at the inn. - Well you enjoying your stay here? - It's been a bad day today. - Oh we all have bad days. - Yeah? - Look, why don't you join me for a drink? Come on. Sweetheart, a fresh one and one for my friend. - You bet. - So, tell me all about your bad day. Seemed like you two were having fun at the lighthouse. - Yeah that was the highlight of my whole stay. Great. Thank you. It's been, well, a lot of weird things going on. - Huh, what kind of weird? - Well, I just don't want you to think I'm crazy, but when I was putting clothes in my drawer, the drawer shut itself. I didn't touch it. And then this goofy thing happened with my watch, and I lost an hour of time. Like, I don't know where it went. And then a painting just falling on the floor. - I guess I shouldn't have told you that that place was haunted. - No, it's okay. I'm just learning the hard way, thanks. - The painting you're talking about, is it of the shipwreck? - It's a ship being tossed around by the sea, yeah. - The ship in that painting, it's the Sir Edmund James. Remember the shipwreck I told you about on the tour? - Ah yeah, of course, right. - Legend has it that old Captain Louis still roams those halls at night. It's all in that ghost tour that I told you about. I could tell you scare easily. - God, well, yeah, well it's like you say, it's just folklore. - And if you wish to believe that sort of thing you compound the problem. - What do you mean? - Well. I'm not the sort of person that really buys into all of the hocus pocus stuff. But I got people who swear to me they see things in this town. - Like what? - You know, supernatural, ghosts, sightings. Things not of this world. - Has anything ever happened in the hotel where I'm staying at? - I'm sure a lot of things have happened. It's over 150 years old, there's a lot of history. - No, I mean, is there anything in particular? - Where are you going with this, Billy? - I found this videocassette under my bed and I put it in the player. And this home video comes up and it's this couple, them driving around and then being followed by these two guys with a video camera. And they get into some sort of altercation. And then the video kind of fuzzes out and a picture comes back up. And these two guys were right in front of my hotel door. - Are you shitting me? - No, right where I'm staying. They break in and they murder that couple. They butcher them. - That's one hell of a story there. - Well does it sound familiar? Tell me. - Well, there have been a few murders over the years here. - How many is a few? - I don't know. I'd say, there's been about eight unsolved murders in the last 40 years. The one you mentioned, I remember it all right. It was damn grisly, those kids they butchered. They were just a young couple. No one ever mentions it. None of it. - Well what about the cops? - Cops? They're useless. This is a one horse town. - So they didn't do anything about it? They don't care? - Sure, they care about keeping things like that out of the paper. Hurts the economy. Tourism is this town's bread and butter. - When did it happen? The last one? How long ago? - Oh. I don't know, I'm bad with dates. Plus I've been drinking all night. - Are you sure? - Of course I'm sure. - What? Charles, what? - Be careful out there, Billy. - This guy following me? What do you want? What do you want? - Hello, can I assist you? - Where's the phone? - It's behind the desk. - I need you to make a call. - Okay. Who shall I phone? - There was an incident that happened. I need you to call the police. - What sort of an incident? - There was a car that was following me. - That's it? Maybe they were lost. - Are all you people in on this? - What do you mean you people? Look, I'll be happy to make the phone call, but you gotta realize one thing. It's past midnight and there's only one car to patrol the whole island. - I don't care if there's only one car that needs to go patrol the goddamn zoo! I don't care, call the fucking police! I need you to call the police! Get the phone, make the phone call! Call! - All right, all right! I'd be happy to do it. - Thank you! - You know, it may take a while for them to arrive, that's all. If you want me to call them, I'll call them. - No, no, no. No, I don't want you to call them. I don't want you to call them. Forget it. Just forget it. - Sir, I'll be happy to call them. It might take a while. Sir? Sir? - Baby, it's me. Let me in. - Coming. Hey. - Your battery's dead. - Is everything okay? Billy, is everything okay? - Black car ran me off the road. It was the same car that was at the rest stop. These are the same people that did this in the videotape. - Okay just relax. - These are the same people and they wanna kill us, that's what they wanna do. I went to go pick up your phone and you know that guy at the lighthouse? - Charles. - Charles, Charles. Charles was at the restaurant. He told me that there were murders in this town. - You're freaking me out. - Huh? They're gonna come and murder us, 'cause it's what they do. They pinpoint the couple that comes around this time of the year on the off season and they kill 'em. - Billy. The detective said there was nothing on the tape. - Well, of course there's nothing on the tape 'cause that's what they do, they erase the tape. Go charge your phone. - I feel sick, I wanna go. We're going, that's what we're doing. - We can't leave because the tire's blown. - What?! - The tire's blown. - What do you mean the tire? - I pulled into the parking lot, tire's blown. - Then what about the guy downstairs? - He's in on it too. - Well then we're gonna call triple A, that's what we're gonna do. - Nah, we can't call triple A. Triple A can't come, they're not gonna come now. We gotta wait till the morning. We gotta stay here. So make yourself comfy. Charge your phone, just lie down. Just relax tonight. - Help, Billy, help me! - Isn't she hot, look at her! Why do you fucking bleed so much? Oh, hello. You're just in time. Come here. Wake up, asshole. - Ah, Billy. How was your stay? - I'd rather not talk about it. - Mr. Curtis. I need you to sign this please. Victor tells me that there was a car chasing you and then you asked him to call the police. - Yeah, it was real fun. - Well maybe it's just a couple kids messing around, you know, with nothing better to do. - Yeah, maybe. - Let me give you a better pen, I'm sorry. Here, try this one. We hope to see you again and I'm sorry your stay wasn't everything you planned. - Yeah, things happen. - Of course, no. We look forward to seeing you as well. See you then, bye. What's this? - The couple in room two, they left this behind. Yeah, I guess they dropped it. Maybe you can give them a call. They'd surely want it back. - I don't think they'll need it. They won't be coming back. No. - Baby, baby. Call the police. - Huh? You're okay. - No. - Just pull over babe, pull over. - Come on. - Just pull over, you're okay. You're just gonna pull over right now, pull over. Just pull over. You got this. - There's the car, he's back. He's right behind us. - Oh my god. - Billy, pull over. Billy, pull over. Billy? No, no, no, seriously, pull over. Billy, you're okay. - No, no! - Pull over, babe. Please, please, slow down. Billy, slow down. Please pull over. Please pull over. Please over. Please pull over. - Oh shit. - Stay here. Come on, you're okay. You're okay, okay? - He's everywhere. I can't shake him. I can't shake him. I love you. - I love you. - I love you. - Okay. We're gonna get the fuck out of this place.
