I'm not saying I'm anti-feminist. What I'm saying is, some feminists take it way too far. Oh so, because you're uncomfortable with some of it, all women should just shut up and not say anything? When you say that men are the reason the world sucks? Yes, I think it's bullshit. Men have screwed up some history, sure, but Eve ate the apple first. Oh, my God. It's true. How do you live with this guy, Sarah? Sarah! Sorry, what? You hear your husband? Yeah, how dare I not just roll over and let you shit all over men. Sorry, if you can't comprehend someone actually standing up to you... Daniel. Hey, man, are you sure the forest doesn't close at night? How the hell are you gonna close a forest? Anyway, what was I saying? Shitting on women and continuing the patriarchy. See, that's what I'm talking about, Naomi. Any time... Daniel, I think we get your point. No, let him finish, Sarah. Overconfident mansplaining is my favorite dish to feed on. See! Right there! That's what I'm saying, anytime a man has an opinion... An opinion on something a man don't get an opinion on. I'd like to go on record and say that I, 100% support feminism. Oh, thank you, baby. That's all I need to hear. Now, mind ya' business. Right. All I am saying, is that no matter what some feminists wanna turn men into, y'all need us. Men are providers, men are protectors. It's in our DNA. Wow. You can wow all you want. You know it's true. Women want a man. James, you can have a woman run the whole world, if she's not satisfied... Sarah, I seriously hope your home life is not like a 1960s commercial, because I just... I would love if we could just move on. So, I'm not allowed to have an opinion on your shit, but you're allowed to have an opinion on mine? James, you didn't tell me your friend wanted all the smoke. Hey James, will you tell your girlfriend that if she's gonna serve it, she better be ready to take it. What? Sarah, it must be nice having such a dedicated provider take care of you. What is it that you do again for work, Daniel? You're funny. I think any relationship should be give and take. Sometimes one person supports the other and vice versa. And I don't think either of you are really shitting on anyone except each other. Hmm. What is that? Oh, it's the park ranger. See, I told you we're not supposed to be out here. Just chill, man. We're fine, alright? I got this. How are you, sir? Doing well, thank you. Where y'all headed? Bear Lake. Heard the catfish are really biting this season. Little late for that, don't you think? Oh, we're taking these two back for the weekend. Gonna hit the lake in the morning. Not many people know about Bear Lake. I do. Alright, well, we warning people not to venture out that far, especially this late. But if you know the area, just keep your heads up. We've had a busy season for IRs. IR's? Incident reports. Missing hikers, strange sightings, you name it. We'll keep our heads up. Good, 'cause you're be alone out there. Fine. That's how it should be. I've got a flare gun in here, just in case. You realize you can burn down an entire forest with that? It's... it's just for emergencies. Mhmm. Y'all be safe. Thank you, sir. The fuck, man, really? What? You're gonna talk to an officer like that with two black people in the back? Yeah. You said you were South American... Officers don't care. They see dark skin and they just... Okay, first, he's not an officer... He has a badge. That's all the power he needs! Second, he has to tell us to be safe. It's literally his job. That is not what I heard it. So, how are you going to conquer the world if you're too afraid to sleep in the woods? Well, look, at least we got a road trip out of this. Uh, we're still going. Babe, I know you were really looking forward to this weekend, but that ranger made it sound like... There is something out there killing people! That's what you took from that conversation? I can read between the lines. That's not what he said at all. Yeah, we're going, thank you. Oh, so now you speak for everyone? Not as good as you. Pendejo. Okay, you two, you've been going at it since we got on the road. Let's just take a vote. No, we're not taking a vote. I vote no. I'm with him. Are you serious? We came out here to relax. And so far, nothing about this trip has been relaxing. And who's fault is that? Naomi, what do you think? Well, do I want to come out here with the alligators and the rangers that are probably in the KKK? Not really. But I cannot spend another weekend cooped up in the apartment with him. No offense, babe. And I will literally murder your husband if he tries to call me scared. Plus, we've got a flare gun! What the hell could go wrong? Tied at two. Fine, let's go. Thank you. I have a bad feeling about this. Wow, look at that sunset. It's good-looking sunset. Alright, walk in from here. Walk in? Walk in where, Daniel? I thought we were already at... I don't have to walk forever or mosquitoes biting forever. Biting. It is pretty out here. Do one thing for me this weekend. Grow a pair. Oh, I'll grow a pair. Ooh. Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Get that bad boy, yes. Daniel! Daniel! Hurry. Well... well, can you wait? So, the truck driver asked the woman if she needed a ride. Now why wouldn't he, right? She's real hot, she's by herself, crying, all alone. She says, yes, she gets in, he keeps on going, just deep into the woods. Feeling pretty good about himself, right, thinks he's about to get laid. A few days later some hikers find his body. Two bullet holes from a .22 caliber handgun. When the hell will you men learn, when you see a woman walking in the woods, leave her the fuck alone. And that happened here? When? 1990. That story was cute, but I got one better. Eh, I'm not even done. And it involves a hot-ass chick, too So, before grandma moved to the States, she grew up in Colombia. South America. From childhood they were told stories about monsters that who lived in the Amazon. But one monster always stuck out to me, because it's one she says our ancestors actually saw. The woman who haunts the jungle on one leg. When she first appears, she's beautiful, that's how she lures you in. But when you seen her true form, it's way too late. Legend has it that she was a beautiful woman who cheated on her husband. When she got caught, he murdered their children in front of her, then chopped off her leg and left her to die. Now, centuries later she haunts dense forests, just like this one, looking for men who are unfaithful to their wives. And some families say, she's got fangs, and claws, and a hoof. But others say, just like a vampire she sucks your blood. One thing they all agree on is that once she's claimed her victim, she sings this hauntingly beautiful song you can hear it through the forest. Wait a minute. Women cheat, too. So what does she just let them go? 'Cause that is sexist. The women, she bewitches. That means she possesses their bodies. Ah. Apparently, the only people immune are those with legit purity in their hearts. No unfaithfulness, no ill will toward anyone So non-cheaters are safe? Like, she just doesn't come after them? Apparently, they don't even see her when she's around. Oh, okay, I'm good. That's lame. Babe, make out with Naomi. See if she shows up. Daniel! What? You wanna kiss James? You can kiss my ass. I just think my story's better, I'm sorry. In your story, if you're not a cheater, there's just nothing to be afraid of. That's according to one version of the legend. What's her name? Oh, no, I'm not saying. No. Legend says that if you say her name, it invites her presence. Just like a moment of weakness can invite unfaithfulness into your relationship. You really want me to bring all that on us? Oh, like Candyman. No, thank you. You guys are weak. I'm not saying it. I'm not stupid. I just... She tries to be so hard. You know, I just wouldn't imagine her being afraid of her grandmother's ghost story. She's called, "La Patasola". Anticlimactic. Seriously? La Pata-solo? Come on, it sounds like a Star Wars character. Ooh, it was me, I did it. Here. Yeah, I'd love to see something try me right now. Daniel. What? We need more firewood. Mmm. Seriously. You said her name. Just in case. That fire was weird, right? Guys? What's up? Nothing. It's just... What? You were harsh today. Harsh? You've been rude to Naomi all day. She doesn't care, babe. It's not personal with chicks like that. I've met a ton of them, okay. They live to argue. She probably wishes James would stand up to her like that. Well, you don't have to egg her on. So, when she belittles me for not having a job, because I'm trying to get my business off the ground, that's okay. But when I serve it back to her, I am harsh? Never mind. 'Cause you know I'm working my ass off. I know you are. Did you hear that? It's just the wind. I don't know if that's the wind. Then it's Naomi messing with us. You heard the ranger, we're alone out here. Fine. I'll go check. What are you doing? That doesn't sound like him. What he's not gonna do is make me think I'm crazy. How can he make that sound? You hear that? That wasn't you? I'm over here. Yeah, I knew it. It's just the wind. The hell kinda wind is that? Shouldn't tell ghost stories if you can't handle 'em. Yep. I'm so sorry. I didn't get any sleep last night. I'm just jumpy today. It was those ghost stories, wasn't it? No. Because you know they're not real. Mhmm. This ain't working. I'm so sorry. Girl, stop apologizing. I know, it's a habit. Sorry. You said, you wanted to relax, right? So, Naomi's a little different from your usual type, huh? Yeah, that's the point. To be a pushover? Okay, she... she does not push me over. It's cute when someone finishes your sentences, but it's borderline abuse when someone talks for, over, and at you. Okay, she's not all that bad. Oh, yeah? Yeah. How's the sex? Oh, my goodness. But wait, don't think you're gonna steal this one from me like you did in high school. I can fight now. Bro, I told you not to fall for Charlene. She hooked up with everybody on the baseball team. I was... I was just next in line. Yeah, well, na... Well, Naomi ain't Charlene. Oh. I'ma marry this one. You serious? - Hey! - Yeah. You really gonna do that? Do what? Marry Naomi. Yea... Dude, cut it out, you're creeping me out. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yes. Naomi is the one. She's the one. I brought the ring with me. I'ma do it while we're here. No, you're not. Yes, sir. What was that? Catfish. It's a big one. You were right, that helps a lot. I got you. How do you do it? Do what? I don't know. You're just so... ...blunt. I mean... I mean strong, like you know what you want and you just say it. Why wouldn't I say it? You should. And I do. It's that simple, babe. Um, not for me. Do you think you matter? Uh, yeah. Bullshit. If you really believed that, you would demand to be heard. You would demand that your voice meant just as much as everyone else on this planet. Daniel ain't shit. No offense. He's your guy. But, to everybody else in this world, he is no different than you or me. You just have to know what you want. I know what I want. Yeah, but it can't be like happiness or something... I want to quit my job. Oh, shit. I wanna go to nursing school. Good shit. Now, all you have to do is tell Daniel that. We can't afford it. I'm the only one with any income since Daniel's been trying to get the business going. No, and I've always believed that relationships are never 50-50. Sometimes they're 60-40, 70-30... How much longer are you gonna sacrifice your happiness? If he's your partner, that 60-40 has to swing the other way at some point. You got dreams, girl. And if you let Daniel keep you from them, you're gonna hate him. And worse, you're gonna' hate yourself. Can I give you a piece of advice, bro? If you think Naomi is the one, then you have got to stand up to her. Chicks like that, they just need somebody who can see 'em eye to eye, you know? I don't know, man. She's everything I'm not. Like, isn't your wife supposed to complete you? Complete you, yeah, not control you. She doesn't control me. I don't know, man. I just don't think you guys are ready for that. Damn. It's like that? It's truth. Your truth. I got ants in my beer. That's not gonna taste good. Not to pry, but you and James seem... I don't know... I thought if instead of my usual type, I dated the opposite. I met James and I thought we would yin and yang. But it's been more yin and yawn. He's a sweet guy, though. I don't dig sweet. I think I'm gonna break up with him when we get back. Oh, wow. He's gonna be heartbroken. He'll live. Hey! Check this bad boy out.'s Can you believe how big he is? Dinner time! It's not bad, man, first time, it's beginner's luck. Hey, well, I mean, I don't believe in luck. So, it's just something I can do every time we go. It's a Black River catfish. It's good stuff. Oh, thank you. You're welcome. Thanks, baby. Y'all have fun gutting 'em, too. Hmm. Mm-mm, you smell like outside. Well, we are outside. You really have to do that right here? You don't gotta eat it. We need more firewood. James will get it. Yeah, sure, I'll get it. Alone? I'll go with you. I've been sitting too long anyway. It's really nice how everyone is contributing to dinner. Fine, I'll cook it. No, you won't. Yes, I will. You probably didn't even bring any seasonings. You don't know anything about cooking. You're not cooking the fish. Why? Because you're so good at it? Yeah. But you can't... And I caught it and I'm cooking it. You clearly don't know what you're doing. Look... look at how ridiculous... Okay, you don't even know what I'm doing. Neither do you! I never seen anything like it. I mean, they can't go five minutes without going at each other's necks. It's like watching two lions fight over territory. I should've brought a first aid kit. Look, look, if Daniel gets anywhere near Naomi, he will end up in the lake. Didn't think I need it for her. Right. You know, I read that leaving markings for yourself in case you get lost can save your life. Nice. Fun fact. I caught the fish, I brought the pan! I'm cooking it! I brought the seasoning, and the sauce, and my people fry fish better than yours. Of course, this is a race thing! It's a taste thing! And you don't have any! Whatever. - Give me the fish. - No. I'm not playin', gringuito! - Give me the fish! - No! Give me the damn fish! So, Naomi? Thinking she could be the one or just a fling? I know she's the one. Were you checking me out last night? No. May... maybe we should... I'm already ahead of you. - Something in... - The woods behind. I tripped and fell. Nothing. So, who's cooking? He is. She'll season. That woman hates to compromise. Good. Okay. Mmm. Oh my God, guys. This is delicious. Hmm. You two could open a restaurant. Mhmm. What would we even call it? Duck. Oh, so now we're cooking duck, too? No, it's what we'd tell to all our guests so they'd know to dodge the pans we'd be throwing at each other. Dinner and entertainment. Bet. You can try and hide it, but I know what's going on here. You two are actually getting along. Well, I'ma go throw up now. Mhmm. Well, I think it's nice. We should celebrate. This should still have some left, right? I'm already high. Sarah? What? Give me that shit. Lighter? Oh. This is exactly what I wanted this weekend to feel like. Yeah, this is dope. And thank you, you guys. I knew you didn't really hate each other. Of course. Just what we needed. New beginnings. Speaking of new beginnings... What are you doing? I'm growing a pair. Naomi, I've never met anybody who pushes me the way that you do. Who makes me want to be the best version of myself that I can be. Oh, my God. I want to spend the rest of my life with you. No, you don't. Will you marry me? Daniel. Daniel! Babe, I'm still kinda' high and I'm horny as hell. How are you not angry right now? Oh, come on! You know they don't belong together. But his proposal was so sweet. No, it wasn't. It was stupid. Well, she didn't have to do that. Do what? If you don't want to marry someone you say, no. Not like that. She didn't have to humiliate him in front of us. That's your best friend. And I told him it was a dumb idea, and he didn't listen to me, so... You are unbelievable! You treat other people so savagely. I was just telling him the truth. I want to quit my job. You wanna hear the truth? You want to know how it feels? You're taking advantage of me. Come on. I'm killing myself to support both of us and honestly, you're not doing your part. I'm working my ass off. Are you? 'Cause I pay the bills. I take care of the house, laundry, dishes. Yeah, I'm... I'm starting a business. That doesn't take five years, Daniel! It's a failure. It's not happening. What do you want from me? I want you to support my decision to go to nursing school. We can't afford that. We can if you get a job. Are you serious? I've done my part. I've held us together, now it's your turn. This is bullshit! What are you doing here? Jogging. Anything left in that? Why would he propose? So stupid. I told him not to. Not surprised. The hell does that supposed to mean? You're a dick. Oh my God. Go screw yourself, okay? Big words coming from a spoiled man-child who thinks he's tough, but really he's just some puss living off his wife's salary. So, you're the reason why Sarah all of a sudden wants to blow up our entire life? Oh, I'm not the reason, I'm the realization. You think you're so smart. You think you're better than everyone 'cause you got a bigger mouth. Oh, I have a big mouth? Yeah, you do. When someone actually comes back at you, you don't know what to do, so you just yell louder. James is a good dude. He didn't deserve what you did. And you think you deserve Sarah? That woman would die for you, but your head's so far up your own ass that all you see is your own shit. Hmm, you know it, too. She is miserable, because of you. Get out of my face. You ain't shit. I said, get out of my face. Or what? The hell you gonna do? The hell you gonna do? Sarah? Hey, James. You okay? I thought I heard you crying. Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. Are you okay? Yeah. Hey, James? Yeah? Have you seen Daniel? Think I saw him walk by a minute ago. Sarah! Naomi! Help! Get off me, get off me! What happened? Your tent! Something's in your tent! You okay? Something bite you? I'm fine, I... I didn't see it. I saw it, okay. There was a shadow. Something's in there, man. Like an animal? Like a person. I think it was a woman, man. Hey! Come out! Come out now or we're gonna call the police! I swear to God something is in there. It's your last chance, come on! It was right behind her. Well, it's not there now, man. I... I... look, I swear, I saw something right behind her. It... it was a shadow... James, just chill! I'm not crazy, okay! I saw something in the tent! There's somebody out here with us... Where, dude? There's no one's out here! I know what I saw, okay! I know what I saw. Sarah, what's he talking about? I... I don't know. I never saw anything. Okay, I know what you guys are thinking, but this is not me being scared of shit, okay! James, there is no one here, man! What, you think I'm making this up? You've been afraid since before we got here! So kind of, yeah, I do. Fuck you, Daniel, alright? With all your macho-bro shit. We're leaving, right now. Oh, okay, oh, yeah, yeah. Where you gonna go uh, without these, huh? Daniel, please! Stop, he's terrified. No, he's not. He's pissed that he got dumped and now he's just throwing a fit! Will you please listen to someone else for once? No! I'm not driving home four hours in the middle of the night because he's scared! Whatever, okay. We leave first thing in the morning. I'm fishing. Daniel, please. I'm going to bed. I'm sleeping in the truck. Are you serious? I'm dead-ass serious. Oh, my God. It's pathetic. Daniel! Come on, Sarah. No. No? I'm not sleeping in a tent next to you. Naomi, do you mind? Sure. Oh my God! You have all lost your freaking minds! Okay, fine here, let me do a huge favor for all of us. And I will just bounce myself down all the way here with the alligators, and the turtles, and the frogs that way you never have to see me again, alright? That what you want? Son of a... Goddamn it! What if James did see something? That story you told us. About the woman with one leg. You said her name. She could be here. She's not real. But some people can't see her. And I swear I heard singing last night. She's not real, Sarah. It's a legend used to scare people. In the legend, how do people fight her off? Fire. Would you like me to re-light it? Thank you. She can't be real. Come here. Hmm? Hmm. Come, Daniel. Naomi? We're gonna get caught. Will you cut that shit out? Okay? I don't... ...understand what you're saying. This better? Are you lost? Are you okay? What the hell. Morning. Morning. How'd you sleep? I didn't. Yeah, that was some night. Yeah, I don't wanna talk about it. Just wanna get out of here. I'll get Daniel up. Hey, Daniel, I think that we should... could... Daniel? He's not there. Are you serious? Yeah. Damn. I just wanna get out of here. Maybe he's at the lake. He did say he was going fish. Right. I'll go get him. Oh, hey. Morning. Where is everybody? Uh, James went to get Daniel from the lake. Oh. Hear, let me help you... I got it. My bad. Naomi, I'm sorry that... Girl, stop. You are the last thing that needs to be appolog... What is it? Naomi. I need to pee. Daniel? Daniel, come on now, we don't have time for this. Daniel! I get the point, okay, let's go! Come on, Daniel, please. Hell. He wasn't there. Where... where's Naomi? This is unbelievable. Where the hell are they? What did you see last night? I don't know. But there was something out there. I thought I felt something. In the tent with me. You believe me? I don't know. But I keep thinking about that woman Naomi told us about. The Pata-something. She said, not everyone can see her. What if she was coming after me? You know what you're saying? She only appears when someone's cheating on their partner. Wait. Daniel and Naomi came back together last night. No, no, they'd never do that. But they did came back together. That's not what they were doing. Look, I saw something behind you. You couldn't see it. And they both were gone when it happened. Shouldn't have said anything. You think it's impossible? I'm not talking about this! But Sarah, so you're gonna act like you didn't see anything happening between them all weekend? Look, I know you're upset because Naomi humiliated you in front of us, and you're looking for any reason to get back at her, but I think it's really shitty of you to even remotely assume that that's what happened. Then, where are they? Hmm? It doesn't take an hour to pee. He may be brutish sometimes, but my husband would never cheat on me. I found Daniel, he's hurt badly. Hurt? Something attacked him! Oh, my God! Come on! Wait! Daniel's hatchet, did he take it? We don't have enough time! We need something to protect ourselves! How did he get all the way out here? Naomi? Naomi, this doesn't make any sense. How did you find him all the way out here? One thing makes sense. Oh. Oh, are you okay? Yeah, I'm okay, I'm good. I'm good. Okay. Oh my gosh. Do... do you have any idea where he could be? Isn't there some kind of an activity that you guys should know like where each other are, like... This is a goose chase. What type of game you and Daniel playing, huh? Or is this a joke? You guys working together to get us back or something? Or did you guys hook up last night, and you're trying to cover it up? So, now's the time that you say nothing? That sounds guilty to me. What's going on, Naomi? Where's Daniel? No, look, we're not doing this. They did something, Sarah, okay? And now they're playing games with us. They fucked up, now they're trying to hide it with all this bullshit, okay? Like, I don't care what you guys think, there is something out here chasing us, alright? Like so, I'm gonna take my keys and I'm gonna get the fuck outta here... Oh my God! That was uncalled... Where'd she go? Okay, to hell with this, I'm out. Wait, what about Daniel? I'm sorry, Sarah, but we have to go right now. You would just leave your best friend out here? We don't know where he is, we're lost! Okay, what if the story that she said is true, and the Patasola is out here with us. Then, according to her story, he's already dead. I can't believe that. Come on, we gotta get help. I have to find him. Daniel! Sarah! Daniel! Sarah. Daniel! Daniel! He's fine, he's... he's fine. We're all fine. Daniel? Babe! No! Hey! Sarah! Sarah? Daniel? Sarah? I'll be in the truck. Naomi? Naomi? Naomi! Screw you, screw you! Come find me. Stop... stop, please. Please stop, please. Stop, please! Stop! I said... I said stop! Stop! This is... what's going- It's... it's... Hello? Get away! What's going on? You have to stand up, we have to go right now. What's happening? - She's here, get your light. - Hmm? Get your light. James, James, James! Naomi? Naomi. - Naomi, say something. - Naomi, come on! Naomi? - Daniel! - Listen, Sarah! Wait. - No! No, Daniel! - Sarah, look at his... look his at eyes, look at his eyes! Look at his body. - What's wrong with him? - I don't know. I don't know, look at his body, look at him. What... what are they doing? What are they doing? Daniel, can you hear me? Daniel, wake up. - No! - Wait, Sarah. - No! - Sarah, come on. It's not true, no! That's what she's doing, Sarah. She's got them both. Daniel. Daniel. I'm so sorry, babe. I didn't mean it, I promise. It was just one moment, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, please forgive me. I'm so sorry, I... I love you. I love you, too. I'm so sorry, but I... I didn't mean it. It was just... it was just a moment. That is not your husband. No, that is not... that's is not... that's not your husband. Daniel I love you too. That's not him, that's not your husband! James! I love you, too. Don't listen to him. He's lying! - No! - Sarah, it's her! I'm so... Sarah, don't! It's what she wants. Sarah? Sarah? Can you see her now? Yes. Sarah! Come on, run! Let's go. What do we do? We gotta get back to the truck. That can't be good. Faster, come on! Come on! We're not gonna make it. We're gonna make it! We're too far. Is that... Her true form. James. Shit. Down here. Where is she? Why, Daniel, why? Naomi said, you can fight her with fire. Okay, I hear you. Got anything else? Yeah. Yeah. Let's get this bitch. The highway. We have to get to it. How? You can make it. What? You can make it. No! - Just run as fast as you can. - No, no! You know you can do it. Sarah, don't look back. What are you doing? I'm growing a pair. Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Hey, hey! Oh, no. Hey! I forgive you, Daniel. I forgive you. Mateo. James! Hey! Are you... are you okay? Yeah, I'm alive, you? Alive. I saw that flash. What the hell happened? We need to file an IR.
