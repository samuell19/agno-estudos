A Eurospace Production Written and Directed by Isao Yamada I've Heard the Ammonite Murmur These little rocks are all crystals. Inside, a small fire is burning. Big Brother KENZO SAEKI Little Sister HIROKO ISHIMARU Big Brother (Boy) TETSUYA FUJITA Little Sister (Girl) RENA OSHIBE Old Man ARINORI ICHIHARA Voice KOHEI MIYAUCHI Professor TAKEO KIMURA Mother ICHIKO HASHIMOTO I had gotten used to living alone. Only to think of going to see you now. I didn't forget about you or anything. Rather the opposite. But, what we promised back then, in the end, couldn't be found. You don't have to worry about time. I wanted to talk like we used to in the past. Please, come in. Excuse me. Yes. To your younger sister, this amethyst. Oh, yes. Thank you very much. Excuse me. The angle of the amethyst crystal lattice has some peculiar characteristics, doesn't it? Huh? Dreams melt away in such circumstances. I saw Saturn for the first time at the planetarium, and it had rings. At the park, my sister and I saw the real Saturn and it didn't have any rings. One day let's go somewhere we can see the rings, I said. Brother. I hate the moon. Because just like you, it changes its expression so quickly. Brother. I am here. Mom! When I was little, I would be locked in the attic for being naughty. Even if I ran away, my mother didn't come after me. My mother doted on my younger sister. I wanted to secretly invite my sister to play, but... It became awkward for some reason when we were alone together. You couldn't sleep? I wonder if we could have the same dream? Excuse me. Do you have a match? A match. Give me a light, please. Fire. Oh, a match? That's right. Just a little... By the way, how is Hiroko feeling? You're going to pay her a visit aren't you? Huh, why do you...? Oh, it's the same matches. This is the future. And this is the past. Huh? Why? I've been waiting for you. Huh? Be well. Take care of you body. Be careful. Give me a good life. That's nice. Well then. I dreamed of an older version of myself. My sister, who is in the hospital, sent me a letter with only a spiral pattern. When I was in my second year of middle school, I sent a letter to my sister without revealing the sender. It was my own love letter. It had been bothering me somewhere deep down in my heart for a long time. And today, I received a letter with a spiral pattern from my sister at the hospital. That it was me who had sent that letter that time. When I realized that my sister had come to understand. I thought I had disappeared in the dream. This is a river from the early Cretaceous period. If this is part of the geological formation called the Kameneshiri stratum, Then since the base is mature, it was in the base of the system connected to Honshu until the beginning of the Cretaceous. I see. What about the late period? In the late period, the classification of the system's foundation is remarkable. During this era, this type of ammonite was active in the system's foundation. Desmoceras, Anagaudryceras, Urakawites... - Professor All ammonites. How is your sister's condition? By the way, something that would make you happy is over there. Over that way? Inside of the marble of the department store's walls there is probably sometimes ammonite, right? Listen carefully to that ammonite. When I enter the dream with you, I feel very calm. When I wake up, it continues, and it changes reality for me. Without you as a hint, the world would only become bad. Whose dream am I? I'm sorry for waking you up. How are you feeling? It hasn't changed. I'll give you this. What? Can I open it? Yes, it's okay. Do you like it? The first time I struck a match, the phosphorus scattered and my sister's clothes caught on fire. I panicked, but there was nothing I could do. My sister extinguished it with a glass of water, looking calm. Wasn't it hot? Yeah. I only believed in the power of water. Hiroko, here. Brother... Brother! I had a dream during my journey. One, two, one, two, one, two, one, two, one, two. You wouldn't have a light, would you? Bring it. It's the king's button. Thank you. Where are you going? Good evening! I'm heading wherever! One, two, one, two! One, two, one, two! One, two, one, two! I will continue my journey. If I open my eyes, everyone will disappear, right? You're my brother, right? It's me. Grandpa? Who is grandpa? It's time. Brother. You just want to gaze at me. Even though I was in the midst of flames, you were just standing there bewildered. I was fine even though it was hot. I wanted someone to reach out their hand to me. I wanted you to reach out your hand. Plesiosaurus, Ankylosaurus, and uh.. Liopleurodon.
