All right, I'm coming. Ichogaoka School. Hello, this is Mary. Who? I'm in front of the gate. Hello? It has been hanged off. Must be a trick. Hello? This is Mary. Whoev er you are, stop it! I'm in the garden. Beside the flowers. Oh, no! Who is it? This is Mary. I'm at the entrance. Mary again. Enough of this nonsense! I'm behind you. Then the melon sucked him in. I n our school? It happened sev eral years ago. He lost all his blood. Did he die? His body was pale. How come? Did the ghost kill him? Yes. When you're alone I n school, it'll get you. And kill you? I'll nev er die in school. Did you see it? No. I heard of it. How could a dead man tell what happened? No one could. Blame the computer games. You sat up too late. Because it was hard to beat the last boss. G et mov ing! It's the last day of the first term. Oome home early. I will. I need summer v acation, too. Work hard. That's your job. Don't get wise. Take care! See you. Hitoshi! If you get my school records, don't read them. Who don't you get to school and get them yourself? See you later. Shota, stop reading comic books. Why must I look for your ball? It's brand-new. Did it go ov er the fence? It's ex pensiv e. Here it is! Look! You broke the clay doll. What is it? It's trash. Forget it. Too bad! I'll be late. Don't be late! You're unfair! G iv e me a ride! Hurry! Wait! I can't. Promise me! No time for that. Kensuke! I won't sleep late. You said it many times. You forced me to. Don't laugh at me. You're a fool! Poor guy! You're slow School records? G iv e them back! Oome one! The same old Shinichi! As stupid as ev er. This is no homecoming. Help me, instead. Don't read them! It's your game. Go to class! We're late! Wait! Pick them up first! The first term of this year is ov er. Summer v acation starts tomorrow. What do you plan to do during v acation? Just one thing. Don't go too far. I n the old schoolhouse. Again? I n the toilet? Did it talk? Yes. A female v oice answered when called. The ghost ex ists. Oh no... What a racket! Why are you so noisy? What's up? What's that? We found it after the ceremony. What do you think? Hanako did it, didn't she? What's her class? She's the ghost in our school. I n the old schoolhouse. Not during the day. She actually did! Who'd believ e it? Segawa! Segawa! Segawa! Wait! Show me your hand. Oome on! Start the lesson, please! Olean the ceiling. Now take your seats! What a fool! Somebody tried to enter the old schoolhouse last week. It's off limits! Then what? That's all. So it wasn't the ghost who did it. It was a trick. If you see a real ghost, you'll be a star. Maybe. My friends are simple. Don't say that, or they'll leav e you. Let them go. So they hate you. What did you say? I forgot to bring my paint to do my homework. Use mine. You're poor. You hav e only twelv e colors. I hav e no friend to giv e me a birthday present. G et it. Alone? You believ e the ghost story? G hosts liv e in the toilet. So be careful. Forget it! You're mean! I regret I did it. Enough. It's almost clean. You think so? Let's go before he comes. I'm tired. Anyone around? "Off Limits!" Who's there? Hanako? Are the lessons here so difficult? No. Then what happens? Your grades are poor. I want to go back to Tokyo. Study harder. Going out? We're going to buy organic v egetables. With my neighbors. Again? "When in Rome, do as the Romans do." All right. Mika? Playing with her friends. Bring her home. Your dad will come home late. Eat your supper with her. Kazuo came to school only one day in the first term... I know. Does he still believ e a ghost liv es here? When he senses a ghost, he gets a headache. It's only a v ision. Oonv ince him. I'll do something in the next term. When I was a kid, I believ ed funny rumors. You tell your funny stories to the students? No. You're carefree because you're going to quit school. Are they talking about me? If you're in trouble, I think I can help you. I'v e been offered a proposal. Of marriage? Time for class. Are you going to marry the lady? My parents asked me to. Your story is conv incing. Really? It's like a treasure mountain inside. We might get caught. No. Don't worry. I hav e somewhere to go. It's open. Will you go? Oome with me. It's filthy. They're left to rot. You know a stuffed baboon? No. A series of murders happened at a school. Students died one after another. Blood on the baboon's nails. Let me finish. I can guess the rest. What are you going to do with it? Lt'll sit on the principal's chair. If I were him, I'd ex pel you. G rade school is "compulsory." So ev erybody goes to school. What else? It means it's a "must." No difference. Mika! What is it? Hav e you seen a little girl? No? What's that? What's she doing? Oh? Unlocked. It seems open. Mika! Mika! It's off limits. I'm looking for my sister. "Magic Oircles Beat Dev ils" Mike! Oome out! Mika! Let's go home! Aki She's scared. Ohicken! Ev en though you look cool. Your reputation is bad. You mustn't touch it. Who cares? Don't take it out. Who says so? So you'll liv e breaking rules. Don't be an informer. Your sister's here. It won't open. Why not? Somebody! Help! Kazuo, is Hitoshi back? No. Oan I hav e cake? One piece. Kazuo! Hitoshi? What's up? Something's wrong at school. Oome back before dark. Mika! Mika! Are you there? What's this? I don't know. Let's run. Open it. No! Are you opening it or not? Open it. It's talking. What's up? Why are you hiding here? Something was chasing me. So I hid. Locked up? What chased you? We're cursed! We'll be killed. Supper time! Oonfused? Let's go. Wait. Find Mika first. I saw her a while ago. She went upstairs. Nakamura, come. Mister Nakamura. Nonsense! Oome on! Are you scared? If you lock the door, I'll turn you in. Tell me. What chased you? Maybe it was a spirit. What spirit? My brother said there are ev il spirits in school. He's nuts. I want to get rid of them. He said he'd come to school, if I did. But I think it's an ex cuse. He once threw up in class. Stinky! Stupid! You see? They make fun of him. What's worse, they call us "Throw-up Brothers." You deserv e it. No! Let's be friends. You're stinky, too. Oh? What's wrong? It won't open. Really? Right! Open it! Komukai speaking. Lock all the doors. Happy wedding! Not yet. I'm not engaged. Sorry. Your son already went home. If he's still staying in school, I'll let you know. Goodbye. You want Miss Yukawa? She has just left. Her shoulders rise when she talks. That's why I can't talk to her. But you did. That was my brother. Oh? Something wrong? Mika! Oome out! Open the door! Who are you? I'm alone. I'm scared. Sorry. I'm glad I'm not alone. Your sister? No. What grade? Sixth. Name's Kaori Older than us. You walked in? Seen my sister? The door was open, so I came in. I hav en't seen anybody. Hey! Wake up! Let's go. Know the ex it? All doors are locked. Find a way out. What is it? What's wrong? We all here? Yes. No one missing? Ex cept your sister. Let's get out. We're fiv e in all. I feel there's another person among us. I want to watch the soccer game on TV. What now? What was that? How should I know? Don't ask me! Hey, what did you see? Wait! Sir, do you think ghosts ex ist? You like mysteries. Don't encourage ghosts. Koalas in Australia, for ex ample. If you pamper them, they'll die of stress. I don't know. Oall your mom. Ask if he's back. Did he go in the old schoolhouse? I checked the locks last week. I'll make sure. What did you see? Oalm down. What did you see? That way! Open the door! What did you see? Tell me. Teacher! Open the door! We're here! Teacher! Sir! Open the door! It's locked. How do you play with this? It's in the book. Hitoshi drew it. Throw-up Brother! Kazuo! Help us! G et us out of here! Don't go away! Anyway, call your mom. Teacher! Wait! Mov e ov er. No! Why? Hitoshi... Yumi, can you fix it? No way. No? Maybe you were cheated. Oheated? A call! What? A call for you! Hey! Fix it! It's junk! Junk? Hello. Kensuke? Isn't he home? Be quiet! I think so. He must be Shota. Quiet! It's about time he got home for supper. Oalling Hitoshi Ohiba! Kazuo is waiting in the office. I repeat. Oalling Hitoshi Ohiba! Kazuo is waiting in the office. Light more candles. Stay here. I must find my sister quickly She's afraid. Don't go. You might get lost. She hates the dark. I can't leav e her alone. Take me. No. Wait for the teacher. I'll go. Leav e he alone. But... You don't hav e to follow her. I'm not asking you to come. Go away. Let's go. We'll be back. What now? What now? I can't stay here. But Kaori... Don't be sentimental. Want to stay here alone? No. I'll go with you. My lucky bracelet! You lost it? Search. It's precious. Trouble-maker! Search, Throw-upper. Don't call me that. Sometimes I'm mean to her. To your sister? So if she cries... Somehow... I feel it's my fault. A sister is nice. You got one? No. I want a brother. Me, too. Your sister's? Kaori! Will the teacher find us? No. He's been crazy since he was a kid. He took a box of cake for lunch on a picnic. Where did it go? I wonder Here it is! Shota! It's there! What is it? Who brought it? Stop it! Help me, quick! I feel terrible Help! What's that? Lt'll kill us. How can it mov e? I want to go home. Shut up! Hungry? I won't go home. But it's getting late. Were you ev er scared? Not by a ghost. But... When I was in fourth grade, a girl was locked up in a room. By whom? Me. How could you be so mean? A bully told me to. I couldn't refuse him. I could be a v ictim. Open up! Help me! What happened to her? I went to help her later. The door was closed, but she was gone. Did she jump? Dead? No. She was aliv e. Silly! Later, she mov ed away. I was shocked that time. I didn't know what do do. I had dreams of her falling down. I was really scared. Is Hitoshi here? Yes. Suppose he's locked up somewhere... But if he really wants to get out, he can. Like Princess Tenko I don't know her. Shinichi! Where's Kensuke? No ex cuse! I don't trust you! You always come late. You see? She blames teachers if there's trouble. Teacher! Teacher! What are you doing there? I'm hungry. I want friend chicken, shrimp... Don't mention food. They hav e no sense of cleanliness. They scatter things and make a mess. Too bad! Hey! Sir! Help us! Sir! Why didn't you come earlier? What had happened? I'm scared. Help! What's going on? What are you doing here? We're locked up. Open the doors. G et us out. Wait a minute. You made this mess? No. Listen! It's scary! The skeleton mov ed! Mov ed! Skeleton? Wow! Nothing to "wow" about. Let's get out of here. It's spooky. But tidy the room first. Help me. Don't get hurt. You do it here. It's messy ev erywhere. I need many helping hands. Wait, bearded man! Why? He's gone! Oan't be true! Where did he go? Who is he? You know him? Who? I nev er saw him before Whoev er he is, find him. We need somebody like him. You're ex aggerating. Wait. I want to take a leak. Stop! We'll be scolded. Oan you go to the toilet now? Use this. I don't understand your story. Tell me once again. So Hitoshi is here. Stay here. I'll go get them. Me, too. Stay. I won't get lost. You'd better go in a group. Let's get somebody. Nonsense! One adult is enough. Too much courage. You're short of courage. Am I? This is a lucky charm. Take it with you. Thank you Believ e me. He's useless. You can't tell. When he was locked up, he got a fit of asthma. No more old stories. It's old enough to fall off. Hey! Anybody here? Follow me. Wait! Don't close it! Open it! If Ken gets hurt, you'll pay for it! Sir! Shinichi! Hey! Oome back! Why does it happen this way? There you are! The others? We're all here. You suddenly disappeared. Where's Kaori? Isn't she back? She's lost! It's your fault. Are you care about is your sister? Where are you? All of you? Teacher! Are you all right? Why, it's me. Why run? Don't run! What's the matter? Open the door! Don't come! It's me. Look! No. Oome out. No! What are you afraid of? You. Stay here. Don't come again. Let go of me! Help! Let me go! Help! Nakamura! Segawa! Enough of this silly game! I'm scared. Hello. Hav e you been here? I thought you got out. I'll nev er do that. I wanted to wait for you. But they were scared. We meet again. They're all gone. Don't leav e me. I won't. Stay be me. Funny creatures come one after another. Which flav or do you like, coffee or strawberry? Me, strawberry. I like fruit. I'll buy it for you. I'm sav ing money. You like sav ing? Are you going? I'll be back. I can go in with this. That's of no use. Try, anyway. Don't let me alone, ma'am. Kazuo A sacred thing is broken. Hitoshi? Where...? It's dark. I can't see anything. Hitoshi! A sacred thing is broken. It made the ev il spirits quiet. What's broken? It's on campus. No one pays attention. What does it look like? I'll find it. I don't know. Then I can't. As things are, a disaster will happen. Read the book... Hitoshi! Hitoshi! Answer me! What'll I do? Try, anyway. Nothing else. I can't do it by myself. Why not? Your brother went in alone. You said you'd find it. That's lov e. Understand? No, I don't. Try hard. It's a matter of discipline. They nev er learn it. Kids are always like this. This way. This closet. Oh? Somebody tidied it. Are you sure? There's no hole. I fell into a dark pit. Strange It can't be true. Things always betray me. It happened to me, too. When my dad died... Don't hold me. Who'd want to hold you? Let's find Shota. Don't order me! Okay. Don't say that. Don't ask for trouble, dev il. Who's asking? So you hav e no pals. What's the matter with you? Nothing. Throw-up Brother? Aren't you with him? Where did they go? Why did they do this, of all things? If it isn't Black Beard! Remember me? I was a student here. Some stupid boys took a leak here. Your students? What did you teach them? I'm sorry. I'll punish them. Tell me something. Hav e you seen them? I know where children like to hide. I told them to tidy the hall. My patience has a limit, you know. I'm sorry. They're impossible. There. What are you doing? You did a terrible thing. Apologize to him. We did nothing. Who took a leak in the hall? You run around the hall, clean rooms halfway... Read comic books... Talk aloud, use lighters ev erywhere... Scatter things... Break equipment, nev er listen to adults... Make fools of them... Who raised them, I wonder? Teacher! Yeah? What's the matter? You always bring ghosts! Don't run in the hall! What's that? Who knows? Don't run! You're running! Don't run! Oom here! G iv e me a stick. I want to keep the door shut. No sticks! Why? What? Quick! Run! Why? It might work. No. It's for me. Let me see. Oh, no! Your fault! It's terrible! Not my fault! Hers. Don't pin it on her. Where is it going? Maybe to the ex it. Let's go. Please! Take it easy! No one's coming. I won't go back. I don't care about them. But... I'll go back. What's the idea? I promised her not to leav e. Don't run! Am I pretty? (Magic words... ) Madam! Make these guys work for you. Draw a big circle! What's broken? No idea. I'm busy. We'll look for it. Bring whatev er is broken and left at the school! Where did it go? This isn't an ex it.

Do it quick! Let's go! Hurry! Steady! A big, big circle. This is no joke. Yumi! What do you want? The phone is ringing in the office. Where to? Oafeteria? Wait. Let me go. Wait! Don't be silly. We're pals. So what? Don't you care about your pals? Don't discuss it now! Wait! Let me go! Teacher! Why are you here? The monster...! I killed the monster! Shut up! We're busy! Who'd believ e it? Listen... Why didn't it eat you? How noisy! Quiet! You're noisy. Which way? Who knows? You'v e got bad luck. That way! No way. Teacher. Let's go upstairs. We hav e bought you the garbage. Is this the one? It is not? How about this one? G iv e me that! Is that what we are here for? This way! How about that way? Not this way Sir! Here! What's going on? Madam! G et out of there! Quick! I can't mov e! Help! G et out! Quick! Run! Help! Help! Throw-up boy! Jump! Jump! Do it quick! Quick! Quick! Teacher! You bastard! Shinoda! Oome on! This way! Not yet? What are you doing?
