(lively instrumental music) (train whistle blows) (train whistle blows) - [Reporter] There she is! Madame Petrovna! - [Reporter] Madame Petrovna! Madame Petrovna! Welcome to Monte Carlo! - Thank you. - Are you here to perform? - No, no, I'm here on holiday. - Is it true that Lubitsch has asked you to do a film? - Oh, why don't you ask him? - Did you dine with Charles Boyer in Paris? - Mr. Boyer and I are very good friends. Look, I'm extremely exhausted, and I really would like to go. - Just one moment. - No, no, no, I don't want to any photos. - Yes, okay, like that. Beautiful, beautiful. One more, one more. - Right here, your eyes. Thank you! Wonderful, wonderful! (lively instrumental music) - I have to get through. I have priority. - Bonjour, Louis. - Bonjour, Monsieur Harry. - I think I'll have my breakfast. - Yes, monsieur. - I drove down to Cap-Ferrat to see the sunrise. It was magnificent. - Yeah, Butterfield 2-3-8-4. No, no (speaking in a foreign language) How do you say eight in French? (speaking in a foreign language) Yes, I'll hold. Thanks. Gus Palickian, World Telegraph and Sun. - Henry Price. Daily scribbler. - Henry Price. Wait a second, are you the Henry Price that used to be the writer? - That's what they say. - I read Tarnished Armor in high school. I thought it was great. - Thank you. - Trying to get through to my editor. You know all hell's about to break loose. - Well, if you've seen one war, you've seen 'em all. - Charlie, is that you?! It's Gus in Monte Carlo! Look, you gotta get a rewrite man out of bed, and hold the second edition. (speaking in a foreign language) Hold on Charlie, I think something's breaking. - [Radio Announcer] May the 10th, tanks from Germany's 7th and 21st panzer divisions crossed into Holland and Belgium where they encountered sparse resistance from the-- - Okay, Charlie get this now, I'm gonna talk fast. This just came over the radio. - It has finally begun, Monsieur Henry. - Well, I wouldn't worry, Louis. Long way to Monte Carlo. - But I have a sister in Saint-Maurice-de-Gourdans. - Where is that? - 15 kilometers from the Belgian border. - Well, maybe they'll leave France out of it this time. - I don't think so. - Neither do I. - Early this morning, German tanks of the 7th and 21st panzer division swiftly overwhelmed the forces of Belgium and Holland. (dramatic music) - [Michel] This is the back of the house, madame. This is the terrace. - [Katrina] Oh, it's lovely. - [Michel] And the garden. - [Katrina] What a beautiful view. - [Michel] You see the trees? The pines? - [Katrina] Yes. Who's this? - Jean-Philippe. (speaking in a foreign language) He is the neighbor's boy, madame. I make sure he will not disturb you. - Oh, that's all right. I like children. Tell me something, monsieur, when was this house built? - It was built the turn of the century by the Duke of Gascony, madame. - Really? And this ivy, do you trim that yourself? - Yes, madame. - [Maid] Oh boy, another baggage. (speaking in a foreign language) - Michel! - Yes, madame. - I'd rather you didn't trim this ivy while I'm here. - Not at all, madame? - Just leave it as it is. - But it will get overgrown, madame. - That's all right, I like it like that, it reminds me of England. (speaking in a foreign language) - And where are you rushing off to? Hmm? - My room, I thought I'd take a stab at the typewriter this morning. - You did? Typewriter? You haven't barely touched that thing for months. - Well, I've taken a lot of notes. - You have? - Mm-hm. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Well, you can at least stay and have some breakfast with me, can't you? - Darling, I'm not hungry right now. - Harry. - Mm-hm? - I'm scared. - What about? - All my friends have left Europe. It's going to hell over here, I wanna go home. Please. - Maybe you should go. - I wanted you to come with me. - I can't work back there. - You can't work here either. Look, maybe you don't have another book in you. It's nothing to be ashamed about that happens to a lot of people. - Maybe, maybe not. - Harry, let's be practical. You stay up drinking and gambling all night. You spent your advance at the roulette table. You're broke. You've got tabs all over town. If you just come back to New York with me, I can set you up in your own apartment. You'll be free of all these distractions. - Don't you think I'm a little old for a scholarship, Evelyn? You want me to go back to New York so you can take me around to all those New York cocktail parties where the society ladies bring their pet writers. - That's very unkind. - Well, it may be unkind, and I'm sorry. But it's not what I need right now. - What do you need right now, Harry? - I need to write a good book. I need some sort of stimulus. I don't think I could survive anymore help right now. I've got to deliver the goods now, or I'm out of the game. Maybe the reason you're going is the reason I'm staying. - If I leave, what will you live on? - You certainly know how to reduce this relationship to its basic ingredients, don't you? - Those aren't the basic ingredients to me. You've made me happy, and I care what happens to you. - I'll see you at six for dinner. What do you do Herr Pops? - I'm a representative for German industry. - Yes, you remember, darling, I told you. - You must travel abroad more than ever. - We Germans like to travel, Mr. Price. - Visit Germany before Germany visits you. - Your first novel was highly successful in Germany, Mr. Price. All those years ago. Were you pleased? - Delighted, all those years ago. Except the title in German was as long as the book was in English. - Writing is more difficult than one imagines. One success does not always lead to another, does it? - Well put. Why don't you tell that to your leader? - I was talking about books. - I can definitely supply it. I have a little man in Bordeaux. He's very discreet. - Quinn, why don't you come and join us?! - Harry! Hang on. I'll be over in a minute, okay! - Harry, I'm sure, Mr. Quinn has his own table. - Well, I'm sure he does, but why should he talk to a table when he can be talking to Herr Pops? - Pabst. - Pabst. You'll like Quinn, he's an Irishman, they're passionately neutral about the entire mess. - Harry, it's been a long time. Good to see you. Mrs. MacIntyre. - [Evelyn] Mr. Quinn. - [Christopher] Nice to see you again. - I'd like you to meet Herr Jurgen Pabst. He and my father were business associates 20 years ago. - Very nice to meet you, Herr Pabst. - It's a pleasure, Mr. Quinn. - Sit down, how was Paris? - Like any lady contemplating the series business of rape, very nervous. (laughs) - Now, we know why you're not in the diplomatic corps. - What brings you to Monte Carlo, Mr. Quinn? - A mixture of a little pleasure with a little business. - Everyone seems to be doing business in Monte Carlo these days. - Yes, I've heard that the little man with the mustache is on his way, is that correct? - Yes, and he may be here sooner than you think, Mr. Price. - I heard that Mussolini and Hitler had a bet on who could get to the casino first. (laughs) - [Man] Monsieur Quinn, telephone. - Harry, excuse me, I have a call. Mrs. MacIntyre. Gentlemen. Harry, enjoy your dinner. - Thanks. - Isn't that Katrina Petrovna? I thought she was taller. - I heard her in Munich last summer. She was wonderful! - Really? - I am, Madame Petrovna, the most fortunate man in Monte Carlo to have the honor to dine with you tonight. - It is a great honor for me too, general. After all, how many women have the opportunity to dine with a three-star general. Particularly one who distinguished himself so gloriously in the Ethiopian campaign. - You flatter me. No, no, no, it is your beauty and your fame that makes these jaded heads turn this direction tonight. - Don't be so modest, general. They're looking at both of us. The thing that fascinates most people is power, and that's what you possess. - You think so? - Oh yes. Beauty and fame on the arm of power is an irresistible combination. Between the two of us, I don't think we'll ever have any difficulty in getting a good table. - Beauty, wit, wisdom. It's almost too much in one woman, Madame Petrovna. - I think I'd better order something before I faint from flattery. - Mrs. MacIntyre. Mr. Price. General Propersi. - Herr Pabst. Herr Pabst, permit me to introduce Madame Katrina Petrovna. - It is a great honor to meet you, madame. I'm a devoted admirer of your singing. - I'm very happy to hear that, Herr Pabst. Would you like to join us? - Oh, thank you. Your concert in Munich last summer was the sensation of our season. - Thank you. - It was nearly impossible to get a ticket. I had to pay a speculator. - Oh, I do hope I was worth the price of admission. - You were worth five times the price of admission, madame. When will you return to Munich for another concert? - Well, I don't really know. I've had a rather exhausting concert tour this year. - Perhaps at the Fuhrer's invitation? - Well, that would be hard to resist. If you can guarantee me the Fuhrer, perhaps I can guarantee you a concert. (Big Ben chimes) - How are you getting on with placing your people? - Well, as well as can be expected Sir Stewart under the circumstances. - Well, we believe the enemy may try to transport supplies for the North African campaign out of the Riviera ports. In any event, we're working on that assumption. - What is it you need, specifically, sir? - We'd be interested in knowing what enemy shipping out of the Baia Genoa is carrying, if anything. I was wondering if you have anyone down there who could send back photographs, periodically, when they put into these Riviera ports here. We'd like to see how low the boats are lying in the water. - Yes, well we have a number of people in the south. - Anyone in Monte Carlo? - Actually, it's a woman, sir. - A woman? - Yes, she was married to one of our people who was gunned down in Paris three years ago by German Abwehr agents. She came to us shortly afterwards and asked for work. Well, we turned her down at first as too emotional. - Too emotional? - Well, it seems she was frightfully in love with the man, and she was, very nearly, killed herself in the attack. We thought it a bit risky at the time. - Well, yes. - Anyway, she persisted, and eventually, we gave in and decided to give her a few small jobs to do for us. - Really? - What have you got her doing in Monte Carlo? - Mostly background stuff. Social contacts, Italian and German military, that sort of thing. - Well, I hope it's all right. - What's that, sir? - I suppose she'll know how to operate a camera, won't she? (mellow piano music ) - No, no. Yeah, well if you I think I can get it on the S.S. York. Listen, if you want that many barrels in Athens on the 25th, you're gonna have to pay me in Swiss francs through the Webster Bank of Zurich. Mm-hm, sure. There's a war on. It's not that easy getting petrol across the Mediterranean. No. - Mademoiselle. - No, call me Maggie. - Oh, my name is Louis. What would you like to drink, Mademoiselle Maggie? - Louis, do you know what they call ginger ale and rye? - Yes, highball. - Oo, we're gonna get along so well. - Sure, sure I've got it. Yeah, well use the number two account. Yeah, well just as soon as I get confirmation of the deposit. - What brings you to Monte Carlo? - Well, my grandfather died, and he left me lots of money, and I decided I'd better do Europe while it's still here. - Yes, but you are not frightened? Germans are almost in Paris. - Oh no, not when I don't think about it. I mean, you only live once, right? What the hell? - The same way as you did it before. All right. Sure. - Louis. - [Louis] Yes? - Do you know the man at the end of the bar? - He's an old patron. - [Christopher] Okay, no that should do it. I'll be in touch. - I think I'm gonna meet him. - [Christopher] Hey listen, tell Leona I'll bring her a bag of sugar, all right? Yeah, say hi to Guy. Okay, bye bye. - Hello, I'm Maggie Egan. - Well, it's a great pleasure to meet you, Maggie Egan. Mitigated by the fact that we have never met before. Christopher Quinn. - Well, you have quite a way with words, Mr. Quinn. - I muddle through in English, my French perfectly dreadful. N'est-ce pas, Louis? - Atrocious, Monsieur Quinn. - Do you live in Monte Carlo? - Oh, one doesn't live in Monte Carlo, one visits. - What do you do, Mr. Quinn? - Little bit of this, little bit of that. Import export. - Oh, that's very interesting. - It's a fascinating life. Louis. Now, what's your pleasure? - What time is it, Louis? - It's nearly midnight, mademoiselle. - The witching hour. - Oh, what the hell, a scotch. - A double scotch for the lady, Louis. - [Louis] Oui, Monsieur Quinn. - You're trouble, aren't you Quinn? - Is that supposed to be a compliment? - I'll let you know. (suspenseful music) - Madame! Madame! (speaking in a foreign language) - I'm terribly sorry, but I don't speak French. (speaking in a foreign language) I'm sorry I don't understand you. (speaking in a foreign language) Officer, what is it that you want? (speaking in a foreign language) What? (speaking in a foreign language) Paray, what is a paray? (speaking in a foreign language) Officer, really I'm terribly sorry, but I don't understand a word you're saying. (yelling in a foreign language) I'm sorry, officer, I don't what a paray is. (yelling in a foreign language) - There you are, Frances. I've been looking all over for you. Excuse me, monsieur. (speaking in a foreign language) Frances, Frances, how many times do I have to tell you this is not Ohio. (speaking in a foreign language) Isn't that true? Weren't you? - Wasn't I what? - Weren't you taking pictures of that beautiful bay down there for Marilyn and Sam back in Cincinnati, weren't you? - Oh, yes, yes of course I was. Terribly sorry, aren't you? - I'm terribly, terribly sorry. - See, she's sorry. Give me the camera. - What? - Don't ask any questions, just give me the camera. (speaking in a foreign language) Take off your glasses. - Take off my glasses? - Yeah, take off your glasses. (speaking in a foreign language) Come along Frances, we have Peter and Joan at the hotel waiting for us for drinks. - [Katrina] Oh yes, of course. - Au revoir, monsieur. - Au revoir. Well, I certainly appreciate you rescuing me from that situation, mister...? - Price. Henry Price. My friends call me Harry. - I'm Katrina Petrovna. - I know who you are. I don't suppose it's any of my business asking why a famous singer was taking pictures of a restricted area. - For Sam and Marilyn in Cincinnati. That's what you said. - You're Russian, aren't you? - Yes. - Then why are you speaking with an English accent? - An English nanny in St. Petersburg, and boarding school in Dorset. - Oh, you lived in England then. - What is this the Inquisition? - Just an occupational hazard. - And what is your occupation, Mr. Price? - I'm a writer. People fascinate me. - I suppose like everybody else, you've come to Europe to write the great American novel. - I've already done that about 20 years ago. I'm trying to write another one. - In Monte Carlo? - Well, it worked the first time. Trouble is with Monte Carlo, you settle in here and you lose track of time. - It's one of the charms of the place. People come here to forget their troubles. - Do you have a lot of troubles to forget, Madame Petrovna? - Do you, Mr. Price? - No, I brought mine with me. You on vacation? - Yes. - How long? - As a writer, I'm sure you know what curiosity did to the cat. (laughs) - And you are alone. Listen, there's a wonderful little restaurant in the next village. Most divine escargot you've ever had. That is if you haven't had lunch? - Oh, I have. - How about a rain check? - A what? - Rain check. You know it's a colorful little American idiom for another time. - Another time? Perhaps. (speaking in a foreign language) - [Madame Tranchard] Oui. - Madame Tranchard? - [Madame Tranchard] Oui. - I have a roll of film that I'd like processed. - [Madame Tranchard] Very well, madame. - Monsieur Taillieu at the Cafe de la Gare says that you do the best processing in Monte Carlo. - Monsieur Philippe Taillieu? - Monsieur Jean-Claude Taillieu. - I see. - I'd like this sent to the laboratory tonight. - We've been having some difficulty with transportation. - What sort of difficulty? - The director of the laboratory has taken a trip east. - When do you expect him to return? - I don't know, madame. Perhaps not at all. - Look, I have some friends who are very, very anxious to see these photographs. - I understand, madame. I'll try my best to find another arrangement. - Thank you, good day. - Good morning, Madame Petrovna! Nice morning. - Yes, lovely. (dramatic music) (mellow piano music) (people talking) - Mr. Schimmel? - [Mr. Schimmel] Yes. - Ah, Christopher Quinn. So good of you to come. Sorry I'm a little late. Pedro, cafe au lait. - Oui. - Merci. - Mr. Quinn, my time is quite limited, so if you would excuse me, I would just as soon discuss our business. - Splendid, splendid, good. I think I can provide you with the service which you're looking for. - What service am I looking for, Mr. Quinn? - Transportation, isn't it? - Where did you here that I was looking for transportation? - Monte Carlo is a small town. - What, may I ask, would be the consideration for such services, Mr. Quinn? - A little bird told me that you had diamonds. Now, many of your customers are very well off. They would be prepared to exchange them for their freedom, I should think. - Who are you, Mr. Quinn? - I'm just a middle man, Mr. Schimmel. Just a middle man like yourself. - How do I know that you are to be relied upon? - Listen, my dear friend, nobody in my line of work comes with references. You're going to have to start trusting somebody. But believe you me, I'm not a friend to the Nazis. - Are you a friend of the Jews, Mr. Quinn? - Merci. I'm a great admirer of the Jewish people, Mr. Schimmel. - But are you a friend? ("Can Can" by Offenbach) - Bon soir, Mr. Price. - Henri. - Alone tonight? - Yes. Not to worry, it's the right side of midnight. - This way, please. ("Can Can" by Offenbach) Champagne? - Rose brut, the '28. - Madame Petrovna. - Good evening, Mr. Price. May I introduce, Gen. Propersi. Mr. Henry Price, the novelist. (speaking in a foreign language) Thank you, Mr. Price. Very good. - Mesdames and mesieurs. Ladies and gentlemen. (speaking in a foreign language) Katrina Petrovna. (clapping) Madame Petrovna, would you honor us with a song? - I don't have anything prepared. - Please, Madame Petrovna. It would be a great pleasure for us. - Thank you, but I have the most terrible laryngitis. - Do it for me, cara mia. Show them what a voice you have. For me. - You're so persuasive, Umberto. - Ah, good. - Thank you.

(speaking in a foreign language) - Michel, I'm expecting some people for dinner tonight. I'd like you to sweep the front terrace, please. - But I want to finish this now, madame. - Michel, I'd like you to do it now. (speaking in a foreign language) (beeping) (singing in a foreign language) (speaking in a foreign language) - Umberto, why do you insist on talking to me in Italian when you know I prefer to speak English? - Because certain things are said better in Italian. - Really, and what are they? - English is for cocktail parties and business, French is for restaurants and duplicity, but for matters of the heart, it is Italian. (clapping) - Bravo! - Madame Petrovna. - Oh, Herr Pabst, good evening. - Herr Pabst. - Please excuse me, general, but I wanted to deliver this personally to you, it is a list of our important guests for the Saturday occasion. - Yes, of course, thank you very much. - Pardon this intrusion, madame, but the business of war never ceases. - I didn't know you were involved in the business of war. - I'm what you say only a very small fish. - Well, you must be careful not to get caught. - I shall try my very best, madame. - Another bottle. (speaking in a foreign language) - Thank you, Umberto. Goodnight. - Oh, it's a beautiful building. It's Italian style. - Well, actually I think it was built by an Italian called Francesco Bruscha in the beginning of the century. - [Gen. Propersi] Really? - [Katrina] Mm-hm. - Goodnight, again, signora. - Umberto, wouldn't you like to have a nightcap, maybe some more champagne? - Certainly, signora. - [Katrina] Good. - Wait for me. - Here it is, Umberto. 200-year-old Napoleon brandy from the Duke of Gascony's cellar. (speaking in a foreign language) - What a glorious night it is tonight. It's almost a full moon. (speaking in a foreign language) Don't be so impatient, Umberto. We have plenty of time. Plenty of time. - Let me do that for you. - Ah! Your medals , you have so many of them, they're squashing me. Why don't you take off that hot, tight jacket. Get more comfortable, hmm? And I'll come back in a minute. Don't forget we have all night. - Mr. Schimmel? Well, sit down, sit down. Well, have you come to any conclusions? - Not yet. But I brought something you asked for. - Ah, thank you. Oh yeah, splendid. Well, shall we say one per person? - That's too high a price. - I suggest you take your business elsewhere. - Don't threaten me, Mr. Quinn. There is a limit to our resources. - Well, what do you suggest then? - One to a family. - Well, some of these people have pretty large families. - The total will not exceed 100 people, and 20 families. - I'm going to have to hire a fairly large boat. - You will have a fairly large bag of diamonds to hire one. - Let me ask you one thing, who are these people? - They are people like you and me. - Well, why is it that you're organization is ready to spend so much money to get them out? - I do not believe that is any concern of yours, Mr. Quinn. - All right, you'll be hearing from me. - Katarina, mia cara. What's taking you so long? - I'll be out in a minute, Umberto. - [Gen. Propersi] Katrina, I can't wait much longer. - Don't be so impatient, Umberto. It's frightfully chilly in here, Umberto, don't you think? I'm going to close the window. - I can warm you up. - I didn't realize you that you were so strong. - All Italians are strong. - I'm sure they're not all as manly as you. (speaking in a foreign language) What's wrong? (mumbling) - Dizziness. - Well, then maybe you should just lie down. Lie down next to me and rest. You probably had too much Napoleon brandy on top of that champagne. - [Gen. Propersi] Usually it's not like this. - Oh, I'm sure it's not. I'll get you a nice glass of water. Umberto? (groans) (groans) (dramatic music) (upbeat piano music) - Wait a minute, pal. How about this one? The last time I What's he doing, Louis? Why's he quitting on me? - Well, it's four in the morning, Monsieur Harry. - Louis, I know what time it is. All I'd like to have is a simple little song, and another drink. It's only 10 o'clock in New York. - Just one drink, huh? - Well, just one after another. Louis, we always think we're in control, but it's always the other way around. Women call the shots. Well, it's nice to know going in because it sure saves you time. - Who is it, Monsieur Harry? - Ah Louis, you always ask the right question. Louis, it makes no sense. She says she's Russian, but she speaks English like a duchess. She hangs around with spaghettis with three stars on their shoulder, spit-polished shoes, and she won't give me the time of day, Louis. - No, not you Monsieur Harry. - Well, she does have that little look out the corner of her eye that says I'm open for business. You know what I mean. - Yes, and what about Mrs. MacIntyre? - Louis, that's the end of a book. The sun is coming over the mountain, and I'm gonna write the end. Louis, when I heard that woman sing, God it was like, it was like the first time I'd ever been to the movies. And there were these two eyes burning holes in me, my God, it was like Hedy Lamar. To Hedy Lamar. To Hedy. - To Eddie. - No Louis, Hedy. Hedy Lamar, not Eddie. To women, may we always be in their arms, but never in their hands. Well, Louis I told you one drink. I am a man of my word. Bottoms up. (radio announcer speaking in a foreign language) - Philippe! Philippe! He's here. (speaking in a foreign language) - Wait a minute, what's happening? (speaking in a foreign language) - France has surrendered to Germany. - France has surrendered? - I'm afraid it's all over. - No Louis, it has just begun. (people yelling) - I've told you already, we don't have any rooms available now! - Can I have my key! My key! - Yes, just a moment! - Madame MacIntyre, is she in?! - Yeah, she is in! No, it's not a question of money, please. - Well, hello. - Harry, I've been laughing out loud. This is astounding. It's so good. - Well, I'm glad I finally astounded you. - Actually, I've come to say goodbye. - You're leaving. - I decided to take the flight to Lisbon this afternoon at two, and then go on from there on the Clipper to New York. - I see. - I see? Gee, Harry I was hoping for something a little more memorable. You are a writer, and we have been together, what, six months. - Well, we had a pretty good roll at the table, didn't we? - Here, keys to the Delage. - You didn't have to do that. - There are a lot more important things being shipped across the Atlantic these days than pleasure cars. And I took care of the room. - I wish you hadn't. - You consider it an investment in your novel. No, you consider it an investment in you. - Believe in me. I'm gonna pay it all back. - I do. I've had a hell of a time with you, and I'm gonna miss you. When you get to New York, call me. - I will. - Be careful. - So, Monsieur Le Commisaire, I have decided. I shall be setting up my headquarters in the old fortress in the port. - The fortress? That fortress is old and broken down. - That is so, but you will provide the necessary labor to renovate it. Eventually, it will be occupied by members of the Third Reich. It will become the most important building in Monaco. - [Commissioner] For what purpose are your members coming here, may I ask? - For the purpose of ensuring that spies and traitors are not operating here. - Maj. Pabst, the German Gestapo has no authority to operate in Monaco, which as you know, is neutral. - Perhaps the less said about your so-called neutrality, monsieur, the better. - Do you know that what you are planning to do is a violation of international law? This country is independent. We cannot accept this intrusion. - You think that you have any say at all in this matter? - Maj. Pabst, we are a neutral country. You have to show us some respect. You people are behaving like gangsters! - Let me tell you something, Monsieur Le Commisaire, you are nothing to us. Nothing at all, do you understand? We can crush you like so many ants! Anytime! Do you understand what I am saying? - Yes, I understand. - I am glad that you understand. There's no reason why you and I should not be able to coexist, n'est-ce pas Monsieur Le Commisaire? - What's the source of this intelligence? - Our agent in Monte Carlo. She got it from an Italian general. - What's the point of holding this meeting in Monte Carlo? - Well, ostensibly sir, it's a celebration. Both for the victory in France and for Italy coming into the war, but we think it's a front for some extremely important business to be transacted. All those top industrial in transport chaps, all gathered together in one place would be bound to attract attention. The fact that the information was classified, and that they're holding it in Monte Carlo, suggests that there's something very big on. - Yes. - We're pretty convinced, sir, that they intend pushing ahead with the invasion of England. - Operation Sea Lion. - If Hitler really does intend crossing the Channel, he's gonna have fairly long supply lines, and I think we should do everything we can to convince him not to try. - What are you suggesting? - I think we ought to send planes in. - To Monte Carlo? - It's the only thing we can do. At the very least we might be able to delay Sea Lion. Not to mention the damage we can do to their war effort in general by eliminating some of their top industrial and railway experts. - What about Monaco's neutrality? - Apparently, sir, the Beach Club is outside the territorial limits of the principality, so that technically, sir, the attack would be in France. - I see. What do you think, Lambert? - Strafing with small, light planes would be the most effective I should think, sir. - All right, I'll get on to Downing Street. When's your next scheduled transmission to Monte Carlo? - [Baldwin] Thursday night, sir. - And that woman, the radio contact, if she's infiltrated the Italian military, better be on the safe side. Tell her to stay clear of the Beach Club. Yes, it may get a bit messy. - Stop apologizing, Umberto, it could happen to anyone. Especially a man with as many responsibilities as you have. You've just been working too hard, that's all. And I probably shouldn't have given you that rare brandy. Don't give it another thought. No, I had a delightful time, delightful. The Beach Club on Saturday? Yes, I think I'm free. Yes, I'd like that. I'll see you tonight at dinner, Umberto. Ciao. - Bon soir, Etienne. - Bon soir, Monsieur Price. Scotch. - Don't waste the soda, it's wartime. (speaking in a foreign language) Good evening, Madame Petrovna. - Good evening, Mr. Price. - Price. Why do I get the feeling you're always trying to avoid me? - Whatever gave you that impression? - You like fascists? - I beg your pardon? - Well, you're always with the little spaghetti with the medals all over his chest. What's your story anyway? - I'm not a novel, Mr. Price. - Who the hell are you anyway? - You're extremely rude, and you're extremely drunk, excuse me. - Oh no, I'm not drunk yet, but I'm well on my way. - Excuse me! - Give my regards to Mussolini. - Lucky? You should've put your money on 12. - You've got the luck of the Irish, the luck of the Irish. - I'll buy you a present with my winnings. - Oh will you? What are you gonna buy me? - What do you want? - Let me whisper in your ear. (giggles) - Look, there's no one here. - Well, it's after midnight. Maybe they trust us to drive this thing ourselves. - I'm glad. - You think we need a license to drive it? - [Maggie] No, c'mon Quinn, let's go for a ride. - [Christopher] What floor would you like, madame? - [Maggie] Fifth, monsieur. - Is the ride satisfactory, madame? - It's terrific, can I try that? - Absolument. If you want to go up, you just pull towards you. - Like this? - Absolutely. - What if I wanna go down? - Push it to the middle, and then push it in the other direction. - You mean I can make it go up and down anytime I want? - Anytime you want. - Can I do it anywhere? - Anywhere you want. - What about here? - Perfect, three and a half. (doorbell rings) - Bonjour, is Madame Petrovna in? - She's resting, monsieur, and can't be disturbed. - I've not been able to reach her. She's not ill, is she? - She has not been feeling well, monsieur. - [Henry] Hello! - [Katrina] What are you doing here? - I brought you some roses, but I had to give 'em to the maid. - Well, that's very kind of you, but I have plenty of roses here, thank you. - These are special, I took the thorns off myself. (giggles) She said you were ill, but you're looking swell. - I'm better. - I can see that. Too much booze has a tendency to make me say some pretty rotten things. - [Katrina] Then maybe you shouldn't drink so much. - [Henry] Will you forgive me? - [Katrina] Yes, you are forgiven, Mr. Price. - Harry. - Harry, of course. - God, this villa is beautiful. You know, I've been here before with Gloria Swanson in a masked ball in 1920. God, it's a shame there's a war going on. - Tell me something, what do you Americans really think about the war? - There's a lot of sentiment to stay out of it. - And how do you feel? - Me? - Yes, you. - I don't get involved in politics. - Oh, I think that's a luxury nobody can afford these days, there's too much at stake. - I'm no fan of Hitler, if that's what you mean? - No, I don't mean that. I mean taking a stand. - Stand? Wait a minute, Katrina, where do you stand? Where do your sympathies lie? With the French, the Italians, the Germans, the English, who? - Where my sympathy lies is my business. - You intrigue me. - Let me offer you a word of advice. - Shoot. - Don't become intrigued by me. - Why not? - Just don't. - What if I do? - You'll be wasting your time. - [Henry] What if I wanna waste my time? - It's impossible. - [Henry] Is it? - You shouldn't have done that. - You look better with your lipstick smeared. - Please, go. - Rain check? (eerie music) (gun firing) - No! - Quinn! - [Christopher] Mm-hm! - What types of things do you ship? - [Christopher] What's that, love?! - What types of things do you ship? - What do I ship? - Yeah. You're in the import export business. What types of things do you import and export? - A little bit of this, little bit of that. Why do you wanna know? - Oh, because I know so little about you. - Well, I don't know much about you. That's what makes it so exciting. - You do excite me. - Your skin is trembling. You've got the most exquisite shoulders. They inspire me-- - To do what? - To do this. (laughs) - What are you doing? - Ah, you'll see. (knocking) - Who's that? - [Christopher] Who is it?! - Christopher Quinn?! - [Maggie] It's a man-- - He doesn't sound like the chambermaid. Come in. - Christopher Quinn? - Who the bloody hell are you?! - I'm here for Maj. Pabst. He would like to talk to you. - Well, can I put some shoes and socks on first? (dramatic music) - [Man] Mr. Quinn! - I have an appointment with Mr. Pabst. (speaking in a foreign language) - Be careful of your head, Mr. Quinn, it's very low. Take a seat if you want to. Maj. Pabst, Mr. Quinn is here. - Danke. Oh, I'd appreciate it if you didn't smoke, Mr. Quinn. - Ah, sorry. Well, I'd appreciate it if you'd tell me what I'm doing here, Mr. Pabst? - Oh, you are here, Mr. Quinn, because I have reason to believe that you have had business dealings with a known enemy of my government. - Really? And who might that be? - You have met on at least two occasions with a man named Abraham Schimmel, a Zionist provocateur and criminal. - Is that so? - Yes, that is so, Mr. Quinn. Let's talk frankly, shall we? You don't look like a Zionist to me. So, I must assume you are a mercenary. What service are you providing for Abraham Schimmel? Whatever it is concerns us, Mr. Quinn. Our intelligence people know that Schimmel is involved with aiding Jews to escape the racial laws that is a crime against the state. In your case, you could be punished by deportation. As you may imagine, there are certain Jews who we're quite anxious to keep in Germany. - I didn't think you much cared for Jews in the Third Reich, Mr. Pabst. - They have prominent positions in our universities and laboratories. Positions purchased by money and influence. They have benefited from our German educational and scientific progress, and we can't afford to let them peddle that knowledge to our enemies. - Well, perhaps if you didn't make them wear little yellow stars on their sleeves, they'd be inclined not to leave. - My sources in Berlin tell me you are a man without allegiances, with no ideological bent one way or the other. A true mercenary. That being the case, I thought I could make you a more attractive proposition that Abraham Schimmel has. - And what might that be? - A sizable payment for the details of the arrangement that you made with Schimmel, and your personal freedom. - Mr. Pabst, you are trying to threaten me. - I was just offering you some business advice. - You know, I don't particularly enjoy being brought down here to this medieval dungeon for business advice. And I would like a smoke. So, if you don't mind, I think I'll be on my way. - Oh, as you like. But if I were you I'd think about this chat. Monte Carlo is a very pleasant place to live, isn't it? Oh, by the way, there is a reception at the Beach Club on Saturday, perhaps you'd honor us with your presence. - Anything for a free drink. (laughs) - You'll be at south southwest 18 degrees until you pass Brest, then head 11 degrees south southeast passing just west of Bordeaux, maintaining radio silence over France. Your target is the Monte Carlo Beach Club just east of the city. You will approach in tight formation from the southwest at 15 degrees to the meridian using the sun glare as a shield. Now, as you can see from your maps there is an open area built into the rocks surrounded by water. Your target is German and Italian military personnel and industrialists who are meeting there. The place should be crawling with them. If you hit any flack at all, it will come from the naval base at Toulon, and there are two Italian destroyers presently in port at Nice. All right, that's it. Final weather check 0930, then off with you, lads. If you're in and out fast enough, they'll never know what hit them. Good luck! - [Men] Thank you, sir! - What do you think? - Peace of cake, Arch, just like the man says. - That's what he always says, and then when you get over the target, the flack's so thick you can't see the windscreen. - It's Monte Carlo, Arch, how bad could it be? I'll bet you we even have time to pick up some babes at the casino, play a little roulette. What do you say? - You're bonkers, old boy. Even for a Yank. (dramatic music) (knocking) (speaking in a foreign language) - Christopher Quinn. - Why did you come here? - I'll tell you why. 'Cause if you'd come to Monte Carlo as agreed we'd both be sitting in Drancy Prison waiting to be shipped off to Poland. We're being watched by the Gestapo. Well, they know we've met. And they have a fairly good idea why. Don't worry, I gave 'em the slip. Well, Mr. Schimmel. You forgot to tell me I was arranging transportation for such valuable cargo. - What are you talking about? - Jewish scientists getting out of Germany. - That is no concern of yours. - Au contraire, Mr. Schimmel, this is very dangerous stuff. If I'd have known this beforehand, my price would not have been so reasonable. - Your price is quite high enough, Mr. Quinn. - Here are the details of how to contact the shipper in Rotterdam. I suggest you pass this information on to your people immediately. Ah, well where's the stuff? - What about the boat? It's taken care of, it's coming from Lisbon. - Who is providing it? - There's no need for you to know that right now. - I'm not working for the Gestapo you know, Mr. Quinn. - You take your precautions, I take mine. Now, c'mon hand them over, I haven't got all day. - [Mr. Schimmel] Envelope. - Well, I think our business is concluded, don't you? - There is one more matter, Mr. Quinn. - What's that? - If, for any reason, you should betray us let me assure you that you will be hunted down and assassinated anywhere you may be, even in Ireland. - That's not a very cordial way of doing business, Mr. Schimmel. - I prefer candor to pleasantry in these kinds of matters, don't you? - What time to you make contact with Monte Carlo, Teddy? - Midnight, sir. Midnight on the dot. - Right. I'd better get the message encoded straight away. - Good evening, Mr. Price. Madame Petrovna is here tonight. - Well, if you keep this up, we're gonna have to call you Lucky Luciano. Umberto, I'm terribly tired. I have to go home. - Cara mia, I am winning. - Yes, I know, but I'm absolutely exhausted. - A few more hands and I will take you home. - No, no, no, don't bother. You're on a lucky streak, you stay. - My driver will take you home. - I don't want to interrupt his card game either. You stay, enjoy yourself, and I'll take a taxi. Ciao. - [Henry] You're leaving already. - Yes, I'm afraid I'm not very lucky tonight. - [Henry] Well, can I run you home? - No, no, no, I'll take a taxi. - You know, I'm really beginning to think you really don't like me. - It's not that. - What is it then? Is it Mussolini in there? - No, look I told you you were wasting your time with me, but you wouldn't listen. - I listened, Katrina, but it didn't make any sense. Katrina, that was no handshake you gave me the other day. - Look, there's a war going on in case you haven't noticed. - What the hell's that got to do with me? - Nothing, that's just the point. - What are you talking about? - You. You're not committed to anything or anyone except yourself. I've heard all about your relationships with women, you're just here for a good time, at their expense. Well, there are plenty of women in Monte Carlo that you can do that with, but I'm not one of them. Could you get me a taxi, please? - [Doorman] Taxi! - Do you know the Villa Paradis? - [Taxi Driver] Oui, madame. - There's 20 francs in it if you can get me there before midnight. Please, go as quickly as you can, thank you. - Bletchley to Monte Carlo, do you read? Text. Beach Club target for air raid Saturday 26th. Stay clear all costs. Got that? Stay clear all costs. - What's the problem up there? - Roadblock. - Why? - I don't know. - Sergeant. Teddy, Monte Carlo message from the encoding room. Nine minutes to go. - Can't you go around it? - I think we're going to stay here for a long time. - Who's in charge here? (speaking in a foreign language) Yes, sergeant please let me through. I have a sick child and I must get home immediately. (speaking in a foreign language) - Do you have a pen? Thank you. Thank you so much. (speaking in a foreign language) Thank you very much. They've given us permission to drive through. (speaking in a foreign language) (bell chiming) - I'm still not getting the response code at my call signal, sir. - Have you tried the alternative frequency? - They're not answering on any of the frequencies. - Is Monte Carlo ever late in responding? - Never, sir. I've never known it before. - I don't wanna stay on the air any longer than this, Teddy. Give it one more try and then break off. - Thank you. (dramatic music) (beeping) - Oh no. Oh no. - Madame. - [Katrina] Yes, Marie. - Gen. Propersi is on the phone to say he will send his car for you at noon to take you to the Beach Club. - Thank you, Marie. Tell him that I'll be ready. (speaking in a foreign language) (upbeat music) - [Maggie] Oh, what a swell place! - [Christopher] I'll say this for the fascists, they certainly know how to appreciate the finer things the French have to offer. - [Maggie] Who are all these people? - Their friends of Adolf Hitler. He's probably here himself. No, no, I'm joking. Wealthy industrialists. Arms dealers from Germany and Italy. Here for a little sun-guzzling before bombing poor old England into oblivion. - Oh Quinn, let's not think about that. I mean I can't believe it. Here I am, Maggie Egan, at a party in Monte Carlo. - Shall I let you into a little secret? - What? - The place is crawling with Gestapo agents. - No. - Mm-hm. Remember the man at the top greeting the big wigs? - Uh-huh. - He's a major in the Gestapo. - Really? - Mm-hm. - Mr. Price. - Pops. - Ah, so you came, Mr. Quinn. - Maj. Pabst. - [Maj. Pabst] Nice to see you again. - Nice to see you too. Oh, I don't think you know Maggie Egan. This is Maj. Pabst. - Miss Egan. - What a nice party. - It's a lovely day. The sky is so clear. You could say it's as clear as a diamond, huh, Mr. Quinn? - Thank you. Mr. Price. - Shouldn't be so familiar with me in public. People will talk. - Look, I'm not very good at apologizing, but I'll do my best. I think the other night at the casino I said some rather unflattering things to you. - No, not true. You said some extremely unflattering things to me. - Well then, I think I owe you an apology. - Do you know that's the first thing we've agreed on since we've met? - I hope I didn't hurt your feelings. - You did, but only because you might have said a couple of things that were true. - Come now, Harry. - Well, I don't believe that. - You don't believe what? - You actually called me Harry. That's better than an apology. - Is it? - You know something, I like a woman that shoots from the hip, and I'm gonna forgive you. But only under one condition. - Oh, and what condition is that? - You dance with me. - Hmm, you do drive a hard bargain. - Hard but fair. So, how am I doing? - Not bad for a dried up writer. - Why, thank you. Me Fred, you Ginger. - Wouldn't you just love to be able to dance like Fred Astaire and write like Scott Fitzgerald? - You mean you think I got it the other way around. You think I write like Fred Astaire and I dance like Scott Fitzgerald? - No, I didn't say that. - What makes you think I don't have rhythm? - I think you have other attributes. - Really? - Mm-hm. - What do you think they are? - When you grow up and I get to know you better maybe I'll tell you. - Can't wait. - Oh, I wish we could take a boat and sail away. - That's not a bad idea. - Don't tease. - Well, we can take a boat out in the morning, if you want. - Look, we're gonna have an air show. - Yeah, a bit low. Wait a minute, that's the R.A.F. They're English. - My God. - C'mon get out of here, quick! (guns firing) (people screaming) - [Maggie] Oh! - [Christopher] Maggie! [Man] Quick, over here, this way! - You bastards! (people screaming) - R.A.F. - What?! R.A.F. Oh God, Harry, no! Oh God no, no! (dramatic music) - It's all right, Maggie. Try not to talk. We'll have you patched up in no time. - I'm afraid. - [Christopher] No, it's all right. I'm coming with you. - He's dead. - Well, goodbye. - Katrina. Why are we always saying goodbye or I'm sorry to each other? - Look, I'm really not in the mood for conversation now. Please forgive me. - See, you said it again. - Goodbye Harry. (tapping) Answer me! Answer me! How could you do that? How could you do that to all those people? - Sir, sir. - What is it Teddy? - It's from fire command. Group 10 headquarters. One of the planes didn't return from Monte Carlo. - Poor blighter. (speaking in a foreign language) - What is your squadron number? Where is your base? In Britain? If so, you must've had a refueling stop, where was that? (speaking in a foreign language) Where's your base? Gibraltar, perhaps? Or some so-called neutral country, huh? - Look, Fritz I'm gonna give this to you one more time. Flight Lieutenant Robert Lewis Morgan. Serial number 4744942S. I'm a pilot with the Royal Air Force, Britain. You got that? (speaking in a foreign language) - Where is your base? Where have you come from? - The Geneva Convention specifically states that a man in uniform is only to give his name, rank, and serial number. - What is an American doing in the uniform of the Royal Air Force? - You really wanna know? It started when I was a kid, pal. We used to play army, and I never wanted to be the krauts, I didn't like your uniform. (speaking in a foreign language) - Didn't you realize there were noncombatants there? Americans among the guests. We're talking about civilians here. - Obviously, sir, if we had known-- - It's your business to know. - It's regrettable, sir. - It's a bloody mess that's what it is. I had Downing Street on the phone first thing this morning, they want to know just where in the hell we're getting our intelligence. And to make matters worse, apparently, we lost a bloody plane! And what was an American doing leading that mission anyway?! - Morgan is a crack pilot, sir. - Do you realize how embarrassing it is for the Americans to have one of their flyers go down in R.A.F. uniform? They're supposed to be neutral. - Yes, sir. - Just what are the odds against springing him? - Morgan, sir? - Yes, the PM would be very much obliged if we'd take a crack at it before they ship him off to Berlin to take pictures of him parading through the Brandenburg Gate. - Bit sticking getting someone out of a POW camp. - You don't suppose your man down there could get to him. - If you recall, Sir Stewart, it's a woman down there. - Go and have a chat with De Gaulle's people in Kensington. They'll set her up with some local people to work with. - Nurse. - How are you feeling? - I can't feel my legs. - [Nurse] I have to take your blood pressure. - [Maggie] What's this thing on my bed? - It's just to keep the sheet and the blanket off your legs. So, that you are more comfortable. - I can't feel my legs. I know you know what's wrong with them, please tell me. - The doctor will tell you. - Well, where is he? - He's having lunch right now. - Well, I have to talk to him. - As soon as he is finished. - No, I have to talk to him now! Tell him I have to talk to him now! - Please calm down, I have to take your blood pressure. - Please, tell him I have to talk to him now, please. - Listen, I have to do my job. - Please, tell him I have to talk to him now! Please, tell him I have to talk to him now. - All right. - Madame. (speaking in a foreign language) - No, I'd like a cup of coffee with brandy on the side. - Coffee with brandy. - Do you have any apricot brandy? - You want to come with me and choose it? (speaking in a foreign language) - I have a message for you from Yves Lanselle in London. - What is Yves relation to Catherine? - Uncle. - Who is Philip? - Philip? - Yes, who's Philip?! - London didn't give me that. (speaking in a foreign language) - What is your message? - There's a R.A.F. pilot being held prisoner by the Italians. London wants him out. - I don't take orders from London. - But it was your people who told me to get the message to you. - Why should we risk our lives for an English flyer? - Maybe because he risked his life for you. - Where are they keeping him? - In a prisoner of war camp in Menton. - In Menton? Okay, can you get a message to him? - I can try. - You must be sure. You tell him that there's a garbage truck which collects the pails on... - Thursday. - On Thursday night. If he's clever, he will find a way. - All right. How do I contact you in the future? - Same way you just did. Except that the next time, if you do not know who Philip is, you might end up dead. Do you understand? - Perfectly. Are you always this charming? - Excuse me, nurse, is Maggie Egan in this ward? The American. - Yes, straight ahead. - Quinn. - [Christopher] Hello. - What have you got? - I brought you a little surprise to brighten up your day. - For me, roses? Thanks. - Well, how are you Maggie Egan? - Not so hot, Quinn. Have you talked to the doctor? - Just now, I spoke to him. - Well, it could've been much worse. - Yeah. - [Maggie] You like my tent? - Yeah, lovely. I went to your room. I brought you a few things you might need. - [Maggie] Oh, thanks. Well, why don't you put them there. The nurse will take care of them. They're lovely. - Not half as lovely as you are. You look marvelous! - Christopher Quinn of the silver tongue. - One of the few things the Lord gave to the Irish. Voila! - Champagne. Oh, but I don't think they're any glasses. - Christopher Quinn travels prepared. Watch out. Oh! - [Patient] My God. - Sorry. There. Here's to you Maggie Egan. - To me, really? You know what's funny, Quinn, my legs look normal but they're numb. They just don't work anymore, and I don't know why they don't work anymore. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - All right, Maggie. It's all right now. - Don't go. Talk to me. Please, don't go. - I'm not going to go anywhere, Maggie. All right, just have a good cry. - I love you Quinn. - I love you too, Maggie. Now, it's all right. - Don't leave me. - I'm not going to leave you. I'm not going to leave you. - It is very kind of you to be concerned with the moral of our men, Madame Petrovna. - Thank you. I also feel a personal debt of gratitude to Gen. Propersi. - A great loss. - Yes, yes, indeed. He was a credit to the Italian Army. He had so many friends, he was a fine man, brave soldier. Never seen so many medals. (speaking in a foreign language) Yes. I had spoken with Gen. Propersi about perhaps one day giving a concert for his men. I think, perhaps, it would be a fitting tribute to his memory if you would permit me. - It would be... We would be honored, madame. - That's good. Then maybe I could telephone you tomorrow so that we could make the final arrangements. - Oh, it would be wonderful. - I understand that you have captured one of the pilots who made that terrible raid on the Beach Club. - Si, I can promise you that the war is over for him. The camp has been here for six months. It took two weeks to build. We are doing the best we can. With the war, it's difficult. - Which is the man who bombed the Beach Club? - Let me see. Oh, yes the one with the blue shirt over there. I think I'd like to meet him. - Are you sure? - Yes, I'm sure. (speaking in a foreign language) - Madame Petrovna. - Yes. (speaking in a foreign language) Is that all right? - Yes, thank you. - Do you have a pen? Thank you. - No, just one. - Thank you. (people talking over each other) You know, for the enemy, they seem like nice people. (speaking in a foreign language) Well, it's all right. - That's enough, that's enough. - [Katrina] Is this the man? - [Officer] Yes. - Well, so you're the great American hero who killed all those innocent people? - I beg your pardon, ma'am, but they were the enemy. - Enemy? - [Bobby] Yeah. - Don't you know that Monte Carlo is neutral? There were civilians there! - Those were my orders. - Your orders?! You killed my friends! You almost killed me! - Well, I'm sorry about that, ma'am, but I don't even know who you are. - You don't know who I am? - [Bobby] No. - I am Katrina Petrovna! I am known throughout Europe! - Look lady, I'm from Indiana, okay? - You bastard! - What are you doing?! Lady?! - [Katrina] How could you do that to all those people?! You bastard! (speaking in foreign language) (dramatic music) - This is getting a bit tiresome, wouldn't you say, Mr. Quinn? - Look, I told you the last time you carted me down here, I know nothing about the transportation of Jewish scientists. - The last time we spoke I made you a proposition. Now, I'm giving you an ultimatum. I shall put it to you quite simply. Either you furnish me with the names of the people involved in this illegal traffic, or I shall have you executed as a spy. - I'm an Irish citizen in a neutral country. - Is that so? Tell me something, Mr. Quinn, where is the nearest Irish consulate? I want to know the location of certain citizens of the Reich. - If I knew it I'd tell you. I don't have that information. - But you can get it, I'm sure. - You know, you're just a big bully in a fancy suit. You don't scare me. - I'm going to give you a few days to get me that information, and don't try anything stupid, Mr. Quinn. Germany controls the entrances and exits to Monte Carlo. - Thank you very much, mademoiselle. I just need you to open Miss Egan's room. I'll take her a few things to the hospital. - It was terrible what happened at the Beach Club. - It is terrible, yes, I know. We could've all been killed. - Yes, I hope Miss Egan will be better soon. - Thank you very much. Well, I'll pass those sentiments on to her. Thank you. I'll bring the key back to you. Thank you very much. - Thank you, sir. (dramatic music) (knocking) - C'mon, Mr. Schimmel. (knocking) Mr. Schimmel. (dramatic music) Thank you for coming. - Good morning. What can I do for you, Mr. Quinn? - Look, I'm in a little bit of a sticky situation. - People in your line of business often are. - I need to get out of Monte Carlo. - You have an Irish passport. You can go through Lisbon. - The Gestapo won't let me out. - Ah, well that is a sticky situation. - Can you get me a new passport? - New passports are very expensive these days. - I don't even want to bargain with you. I need a new passport, and I need it now. What's your price? - I don't like to take advantage of people in difficulty, Mr. Quinn. So, I'll get you your passport for a mere 50,000 francs. - That's double the price. - I believe you said you didn't want to bargain. - Here's a photograph. Let me know as soon as it's ready. - I look forward to it. - Thank you. - It's hard to say no to that kind of money. I mean my book sold rather well, but my royalties were nothing compared to the money Hollywood was offering me, so I went out to Hollywood and started writing scripts for three grand a week. They gave me a plush office, a couple of secretaries, an assistant. I rented a house, bought a couple of cars. 35 suits! The money went out just as fast as it came in, and I was broke as I'd been when I got there. But worse than that, I wasn't a writer anymore. I had all the passion gone. No stories left in me. So, I left. - Just like that? - Just like that. Month later, I sailed to Europe. Been here ever since. - So, when I was at boarding school I learned to drink tea from a cup, and talk like a proper English lady. Every summer we used to go back to Russia. We had a dacha on the Black Sea. They were such beautiful summers. I used to spend time swimming and playing games with my cousins, talking with my parents. There was a lot of talk about leaving Russia. My parents saw what was coming. Unfortunately, they didn't get out in time, and when I was 17 and away at school, they were executed by the Bolsheviks. - I was told that you're a princess. Now, is that true or just publicity? - No, it's true, but it's not anything special. There were a lot of princesses in czarist Russia. - If my Uncle Hubert could see me now, dining with royalty. There's a sirocco blowing, can you feel it? They say when a sirocco blows, you can smell the spices of Africa in the wind. - Do they? - Mm-hm. They say that men and women are no longer responsible for their actions. - Mmm, I think I've heard that. - If you commit a crime of passion, they often forgive you. - Oh, that's very civilized. - Turn you into a raving maniac. - And all this time I thought it was just the wine talking. - Wine helps. But I don't need the wine. (eerie music) - No, no. - What's wrong? - I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. - You really must've been sweet on that guy. - Oh, yes I was. We were very much in love. - You don't have to talk about it. - I want to tell you. I do. We were in Paris on holiday. He was killed in a car crash. I've been having nightmares about it ever since. I've tried to stop thinking about it, I really have, but I can't. - If you need me, let me know. - Thank you. Harry, there hasn't been anyone since him. - You didn't have to tell me that. - I know. I just wanted to. - Scribbling away as usual, Harry? - Well, I like working in bars, you meet interesting characters. Would you like a drink? - Not now Harry. Suppose I offered you a job? - I don't wanna job, they pay me to scribble. - No, this is right up your alley. Very easy. Very lucrative. - Keep talking. - Would it be possible for you to run a little errand for me? - What kind of errand? - I need you to carry about $100,000 worth of diamonds for me. - Carry where? - Lisbon. - Lisbon? - Hm-hm. All you have to do is check into the Iberia Hotel under my name next Wednesday. Somebody called Munoz will come and contact you. It's worth $10,000 to you Harry. - Why are you offering me $10,000 to take a plane to Lisbon? - Because those diamonds have to be there by next Wednesday. I'd take them myself, but I can't get out of Monte Carlo, because of this Gestapo thing. But Harry, you can. - What's this for? - Harry, you don't wanna know that. - Oh, yes I do. - It's to help finance to get certain people out of Germany. - Who? - Jews. Amongst them four eminent physicists. - I didn't know this was your line of work, Quinn. - It isn't, it isn't Harry. I'm just the middle man. - Why me? There are a lot of people in Monte Carlo with American passports, why me? - You'd look like the kind of bloke who's looking for a little adventure. I'm just here to supply it, and the $10,000 of course. Are you interested? - Cash? - Cash. - [Maggie] Oh, you don't know how glad I am to be out of here. - [Christopher] I can imagine, Maggie. - [Maggie] Another week and I would've gone batty. Hospitals give me the creeps. People dying all around you. Oh, I wanna have lunch and champagne. - [Christopher] I booked into your favorite restaurant already. - [Maggie] You did? - [Christopher] Mm-hm, you can have all the champagne you can drink. - Oh, and fresh strawberries for desert. (laughing) They were so stuck up at Bryn Mawr. Then the dean of students, Dean Stickney, oh God a dried up old prune if I'd ever seen one, said that Bryn Mawr ladies didn't do things of that nature, and threatened to throw me out. - Didn't do things of what nature? - Spend the night at the Psi U house at Cornell with the captain of the football team. - Quite shocking, Maggie, quite shocking. - Well, actually no, no, no, it was quite proper. He'd had too much punch and passed out on the floor of his room, and I merely took advantage of an empty bed. Quel scandale. - Have some more champagne. - God, I miss this stuff. And I miss good food, and people. And I missed you Quinn, a lot. It's not gonna be the same between us, is it? - Nonsense, Maggie, nonsense. - Well, do you have a weakness for women in wheelchairs that you never told me about? - Maggie, you'll be out of that thing in no time. I know you will. - Well, I'm not entirely out of commission, you know. I mean we'd be surprised what we could do with a little imagination. - Maggie, will you stop talking nonsense. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - [Bobby] (whispering) Hey, it really stinks in here. - [Man] Shh! (speaking in a foreign language) - [Madame Tranchard] Did you find everything you needed? - Yep, everything's fine, I was just trying to get the stink of that garbage out. - Yes, yes, but we've got to get you some new clothes. - [Bobby] I know. - All these are my late husband's. I think you're about the same size he was. - Really? - So, they should fit you. Now, look, look. This white suit? - White. No, I can't wear white. - Why not? - I'm trying to escape. It's night, you know. How about the tux? - Oh, you must be fooling. - I'm not fooling. What do you think? Look, the last thing they're gonna be looking for me in is a tuxedo. - Perhaps you're right. Okay, take it. Now, I made a map for you, so I want you to run over it. - Okay. - You remember what we said? - Yeah, yeah, the Place de Casino. - Yes, that's it. The bar across-- - Lounge blue, right? - Lounge blue, lounge blue. - Yep, okay. - Oh, but you just come in, you sit down, you take a drink, and you wait till it's time-- - Three o'clock. And then, I go down to the boat which is at what's the name of that place? - Fonvielle Beach. - Fonville Beach. - [Madame Tranchard] 3 a.m. - Yep. - And they will not wait for you, not even a minute. So, you must not be late. Do you understand? - Okay. - People are risking their lives for you. - I appreciate it. - Good. Here's 500 francs. - 500? - Yes. And a passport, just in case you get stopped. It's in the name of Etienne Brazare. - Etienne Brazare. - What a pity you don't speak any French. - Well, I got no use for it in South Bend, Indiana, you know what I mean. - Okay, finish dressing and get out of here before they come looking for you. - Yeah, you got a tie? What do I say again if I wanna play? - [Croupier] Banco, monsieur. - Banco, monsieur. Oh, okay? (speaking in a foreign language) And it's the closest to nine wins, right? Face cards don't count. - [Croupier] That is correct. - I'm keeping these. - [Croupier] No card. (speaking in a foreign language) Five for the bank. - Read 'em and weep. (speaking in a foreign language) I win, right? - Yes, monsieur. - What, it's my deal? - [Croupier] Yes, monsieur, it's your deal. - What time is it? - It's half past one. - Okay, let's go for it. (speaking in a foreign language) (knocking) (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) (glass breaking) (yelling in a foreign language) - You wish to continue? - I don't know, what time is it? (speaking in a foreign language) - Five past two. - Let it ride. - Okay. (speaking in a foreign language) - Yeah, cards? - Yeah. (speaking in a foreign language) - Where is he? - [Madame Tranchard] Where is who? - Where is he? - [Madame Tranchard] Who? - [Man] Where is he?! - Crowded tonight. So, you were lucky in the other room, I wonder if you'll be as lucky here. Looks like there's a lot happening. Now, you know this is a game that I've never been able to understand. Well, you were so lucky at Baccarat, do you wanna try roulette? - Well, roulette's a good game except it's a sucker's bet. The odds are against you. - I don't like roulette, actually, I've never known how to play it. - All you have to do is pick one lucky number. What's your lucky number? - 11. - You wanna sit? - No, no, I like to stand. - All right, 11. Red or black. - Red. - [Henry] You all right? - Yes, I'm fine. I'm fine. 17 and 23? - Yes, 23 is my lucky number. (dramatic music) - Excuse me a moment, I'll be right back. - What? You're kidding. - No, I'm serious. Look, he's an English pilot and he's a friend of someone I know. We've got to get him out of here. Pabst is here. If he sees him he's going to be shot. - Let me think. - Look, I've told him to meet you in the men's room I think there's a window there. Maybe you could get him out through there. - It's insane. - I know, I know Harry, but his life is in danger. Give me your car keys. - Car keys? - I'll meet you both out front in four minutes, all right? Please, try and do this for me, Harry. I'm depending on you. Depending on you. - Good evening, Mr. Price. What is your lucky number tonight? - Well, when you're on a winning streak, they're all lucky. Here, take my lucky seat. - Are you Harry? - There's Gestapo behind me. (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) (speaking in a foreign language) There's a fire escape around here somewhere. Here. It's down the side of the building over here. It's not here. Over here. - [Bobby] I hope you're right. I gotta be at Fonville Beach in 15 minutes. Think we can get there? - [Henry] Sure, provided we don't get killed getting out of here. - Hey, hey, here it is. (dramatic music) I didn't know we had Americans in the underground. - Underground, I'm not in the underground. - Neither of us is. We just don't like Herr Hitler very much. - No, he's an ugly little man with a bad mustache, has a tendency to shout. - So, what do you do? - Best I can. - Welcome to the war, mister. - [Henry] Not bad, one minute to spare. - Hey, I appreciate it. - [Katrina] Give my regards to Piccadilly. - Hey, if you ever make it to South Bend, Indiana. - I'll come and say hello. - Okay. - [Katrina] Good luck. - Thanks again. Hey, hold on a minute. Hold on a minute. I don't have any use for these. Take that one though. - What for? - I made a bet with a guy. 20 quid this is worth to me. - Good luck. (dramatic music) - For crying out loud, we've been going over this for hours, Pops. Now, this is beautiful. Where did you steal that from? - Being abusive will not facilitate matters. Now, let me repeat my question, where did you drive Capt. Morgan? - And let me repeat my answer, to his yacht. - And you don't remember the name of this yacht? - I told you, it was dark, and late, and I drove him to the corniche just about the yacht harbor. Now, this is really excellent. Where did you steal this one from? - And you maintain you had never met this man before in your life? - Look, I told you I met him at the casino. We were at the roulette table, he was standing next to me. He was fooling around with another man's wife, he'd had too much to drink, and he asked me to drive him home as a favor. So, I drove him home before the woman's husband tried to kill him. - Whom you mistook for my man when he entered the bathroom. - Look, Pops, if a man tells you there's a jealous husband after him, and someone comes in the bathroom and aims a gun at him, well, you gotta put two and two together, Pops. - Go back to sleep, Mr. Price! Bring Eimenhoff. (knocking) - Hello, darling. Sorry, I got held up. How are you feeling? - Lousy. I hate these exercises. I've been cooped up in this room since Saturday. Quinn, couldn't we take a drive down to Cap d'Antibes tomorrow? - I'd love to, unfortunately, I've gotta go to Paris tomorrow. - Paris, why? - Little bit of business. - Couldn't I go with you? - I'm only going for the day. - I don't care, I like trains. - Maggie, Paris is not a very amusing place right now. I think it's probably better if you stay here. - You not coming back, are you? - Whatever gave you that idea? - From the first day in the bar, I knew you were trouble. And you are, aren't you? - Maggie, I'm only going for the day. We'll have dinner as soon as I get back. - Don't lie to me! Look, if you're gonna leave me, just do it cleanly and don't steal out in the night! - I didn't want to worry you with all this. - With all what? - I'm in a bit of trouble with the Germans. It'd be better if I got out of Monte Carlo for a while. - Well, how long's a while? - Till all this has blown over. I'll get in touch with you as soon as I can. - Are you in big trouble? - Big trouble. Nothing I can't handle. - You do love me, don't you. Don't you. Don't you. - I love you. - I was awakened this morning by two gorillas roaring at me in German. I was invited down to the local Gestapo headquarters to explain to the amiable Herr Pabst just what I was doing helping a captured R.A.F. pilot escape. - [Katrina] That must've been rather unnerving. - Well, no, I found it very amusing. It's great stuff for a novel. - [Katrina] Really? - But there's a little question that's been nagging at me all day. - [Katrina] What's that? - How did you know who it was? - [Katrina] Curiosity killed-- - Yes, you already pointed out to me what curiosity did to the cat. - [Katrina] When? - When we first met. And while we're on the subject. - [Katrina] You're so inquisitive. - Okay, okay. No more questions. I promise. - [Katrina] Good. - Listen, how would you like to get away from all this? - [Katrina] Where do you have in mind? - Well, there's a little inn up in the hills near Vaas, about two hours drive from Monte Carlo. (dramatic music) (gun firing) (knocking) - [Police Officer] Mademoiselle, it's the police. I have to speak to you. - [Commissioner] Was there anybody else he knew in Monte Carlo? - Look, I told you I only knew him a couple of months. I mean, Quinn wasn't the type of guy who'd take me home to meet his mother. - I'm sorry to have to ask you all these questions, but I have a job to do. When did you last see him alive? - After dinner. He went to take a walk. He liked to stretch his legs after a meal. - Do you know where he went? - We have been over this a hundred times! And what difference does it make?! You're not gonna put the Gestapo on trial! You're not gonna stop them murdering people, are you?! Are you?! - You all right? Were they tough on you? - No, they're just trying to do their job. What are they supposed to do, fight the Gestapo? - I think there's something you should know. About a week ago, Quinn came to see me. He was upset, panicky, and he asked me to do him a favor. - Look, I know about the diamonds, and I know about Lisbon, and I know about what you were gonna do for him. I think it's really sweet. He told me. But you know what, I really wanna go to the hotel right now. - Mr. Price, I can see you now. - Thanks. - [Henry] You know where to reach me. - Yeah, thanks. (speaking in a foreign language) - I'm sorry, Maggie, but I didn't really know Quinn very well. - Nobody knew Quinn. Not even Quinn. You know, he only had a couple of clean shirts to his name, but they were the best money could buy, and he always had a roll, and he was never tight with it. He was a sport, all right, Quinn. Never left the party till it was over. - I'm sorry, Maggie. - Oh no, don't be. We had such good times. - [Henry] You're gonna be glad I talked you into this. - [Katrina] Harry, nobody ever talks me into anything I don't want to do. - [Henry] I thought I'd never get you out here alone. - [Katrina] Well, you did. Oh, what a gorgeous spot for an inn. Thank you. - Jean's father converted it to an inn in the 1920s. I came here to recover when I was wounded in 1918. - Wounded? You never told me you were in the last war. - There a few things you haven't told me. - Touche. - We couldn't get rations. Jean would bring me fish and great red wine from his cellar. Now, the theory is Jean's wine cellar is the real reason Hitler invaded France. - Well, places like this are the real reason that I invaded France. - There's a song about wine cellars, it goes (singing in a foreign language) You didn't tell me you spoke French. - Well, when you travel all over Europe singing for your supper, you have to sing and speak in at least three or four languages, Harry. - Jean! (speaking in a foreign language) - It is good to see you! - How long has it been? - Oh, who cares. You're in good shape anyway. - Well, you're not looking too bad yourself, old boy. (speaking in a foreign language) - Harry tells me that you're the greatest, undiscovered culinary miracle in the whole of the Cote d'Azur. - Well, actually I said in the whole world, Jean. - Be careful, ma'am. He has a way for words. - I do know that. - I happen to have one last bottle of that Puligny Montrachet 1928. - 1928. - It's somewhere. - Jean's had the last bottle for the last 10 years. - Then it looks like we got it just in time. (speaking in a foreign language) He's a good advertisement for his restaurant. (speaking in a foreign language) - Oh, it's absolutely divine here. It's so peaceful and remote. It looks like it hasn't changed in a hundred years. - How about a thousand? - [Katrina] Hard to believe there's a war going on. - [Henry] That's what a lot of people are saying in America. What are you gonna do when this is all over? - [Katrina] I try not to think about the future. - [Henry] Why? - [Katrina] Because right now the world doesn't make great deal of sense. Not for anyone. I think all we're trying to do is just survive. - [Henry] Who is Katrina Petrovna? - She's a singer, a princess. - [Henry] Mm-hm. - A woman. - I know that. You don't add up. Who are you really? That's my answer, Harry. - Oh, I like that answer. How about another question. - No more questions. What are you doing? - [Henry] I'm spying on you. - [Katrina] I hate spies. - Now, that's war. - I hate wars too. - I brought a change of clothes. - Did you? - [Henry] Mm-hm. - So did I. - Oh really? - Yep. - I hope they have an extra room. - I hope they have two extra rooms. Race you! - [Jean] Voila. - It looks sensational, Jean. - It is sensational, madame. (laughs) - I never said he was modest. - Great artists are never modest, are they? - Thank you, madame. Bon appetit. - Merci, Jean. Mmm. - Try the wine. - All right. Oh, superb. - Told you. - Everything about this place is superb. - First time I ever saw you you were having dinner with an Italian general. Fawning over you like Rudolf Valentino. And then, I ran into you taking pictures in a restricted area like Mata Hari. You avoided me, tried to get rid of me, then you kissed me as though I was the best thing since Clark Gable. - Harry-- - And then, one night in a casino you recognized a man in a dinner jacket as a downed R.A.F. pilot and you saved his life, why? - Can we please change the subject? Hmm? - It's getting wilder and wilder. How did it begin? Where's it gonna end? - You really do think like a writer, don't you? Look, I can understand your curiosity, but just stop interrogating me, please. Trust me. - I do trust you. - I know you care about me, and I'm beginning to care about you more and more. More than I ever... in a long, long time. But Harry, there are just things that I cannot talk to you about. I just can't. I want to, but I can't. So, trust me. - I don't have any choice. Shall I propose a toast? - All right. - Here's to a happy ending. - Happy ending. - [Michel] That's her bedroom. - [Maj. Pabst] And where is the wire? - [Michel] Near the window. I found it when I was looking for the kite. - And the aerial is up there? - [Michel] Yes. - [Maj. Pabst] Get me a ladder. (speaking in a foreign language) - [Katrina] Jean, thank you it was wonderful. - I suppose we should be going. - Yes, I suppose we should. Harry, it's an awfully long drive back to Monte Carlo. (romantic music) - Are you sure? - Oh yes. Oh yes, yes, yes. Oh Harry. Oh Harry, I feel so safe with you. So safe. - C'mon, c'mon, Katrina Petrovna where is she? - Yes, yes, I know. - Come on, give it to me! - I was going to tell you. - Where is number four? - Number four is the second floor. - Come on. (door bangs open) - What's that? What's that? (speaking in a foreign language) - Get dressed, Mr. Price. - Harry, Harry. Harry. - [Maj. Pabst] Do you want to be shot?! - [Katrina] Oh no. (yelling in a foreign language) - Katrina Petrovna you are under arrest for espionage. (dramatic music) You may go. - What? - I am releasing you. You're free to leave. - Well, thanks for a swell night. What about her? - That's no concern of yours. - I wanna know what you're gonna do with her. - Why? - You got no right to hold her. She's got a Russian passport. - She's a spy, Mr. Price. I have every right to detain her. She will be tried for espionage, and then dealt with accordingly. (laughs) - A spy? What are you talking about? - A clandestine radio transmitter has been found in her room. You should be more careful in future with the women you become involved with. - A radio transmitter? - Her gardener has shown me the location of an aerial on the roof of her villa installed by Madame Petrovna. We have his signed statement. - Look, what kind of proof do you have it's hers? - And now, I would suggest that you leave here before I change my mind, and have you charged as an accessory. Gunther. - Look, I'd like to see her. - What for? - I'd like to say goodbye. - Ah, the tearful farewell scene. Romeo and Juliet before she takes the poison. All right, Mr. Price, just to show you that I am not an insensitive man, you may have a few minutes with her. Gunther will take you down. (speaking in a foreign language) - Are you all right, princess? - Considering the decor, I'm fine. I warned you to stay away from me Harry, but you wouldn't listen. - Well, you didn't say anything I wanted to hear. - I know. I also know that it was wrong to get involved with you. - Why? - A lot of reasons. - Were you frightened? - No. - Uninterested? - Oh no. - Look, there's some pieces that don't fit here. - Yes, I lied to you when I told you that my husband was killed in a car crash. He was MI6 and he was murdered by the Gestapo. A part of me died too. He was my life, Harry, my whole life. - So, you did this for him? - Yes, in some way it kept me alive, him too, until I met you. - Trust me to fall for Mata Hari. - You should've stuck to roulette. At least the odds are better. - I like this game a lot more. - Yes, but it's a lot more dangerous. - The odds are against us. But somehow, I'm gonna get you outta here. - Harry, you can't. Please don't try, just go back to America. Forget about me. - If I told them that I've fallen for a Russian princess, who's a spy, they'd never believe me. I'm gonna have to deliver the goods. Or they'll think I made it up. - That's enough, come on. - Rain check? - Rain check. - How could you do this? The Fuhrer, himself, is one of your greatest admirers. - I wish I could say that the feeling was mutual. - What shall we do about this? How are we going to proceed? - Far be it from me, Herr Pabst, to tell you how to do your job. - The usual method is that I ask you questions, if you refuse to answer them to my satisfaction, I have it made very uncomfortable for you until you do. But I should like to avoid that. - You mean you actually have scruples about torturing women? - Beautiful women. I should truly dislike disfiguring you, madame. - Well, at least that's one thing the two of us have in common. - Don't make me destroy your beauty. Believe me, you will talk. Sooner or later everyone does. I've had harden Resistance men in here crying like babies, begging to tell me everything they know. It's only a matter of time. - I don't expect to be any braver than they are, but I won't make your work any easier for you. - Is that so? I am going to give you a few hours to think about your attitude. I trust you'll come to realize the hopelessness of the situation. Then, we shall begin to ask and answer questions, Madame Petrovna. (speaking in a foreign language) - What do you mean your hands are tied? - My agreement with the Germans does not include spies. - What agreement, this is a neutral country for God's sakes?! - In theory. - What if the gardener had a grudge against her? It's circumstantial evidence. - Do you know what that-- - I know what it is! Sorry, it's a radio transmitter. Pierre, you are the police commissioner here. Pabst has no right, no right to operate here, and you know that. - Who is going to stop him? You? There are two divisions of Wehrmacht within 50 kilometers of here. I have a police force of 25 men with bicycles. I am afraid we are surviving at the severance of the Germans. I do what I can, but with clear evidence of espionage, I can do nothing. Harry, I'm sorry. May I offer you some advice? Get out of Monte Carlo. As soon as possible. Matters will only get worse here, as they did for Mr. Quinn. - Merci. (laughing loudly) (speaking in a foreign language) - Miss Egan. Is there something I can do for you? Are you all right, Miss Egan? - Bastard. - I beg your pardon? - Why did you have to kill him? - What are you talking about? - Murderer! Murderer! Leave me alone! (sobbing) - Have you got that call in to the American consulate for me? What do you mean it's busy? Well, keep trying it, please? Thank you. (knocking) Yes, just a minute. Hi Maggie, I'm awfully sorry. It's an awfully bad time. - Well, I just came to say goodbye, and thank you. - Goodbye? Where are you going ? Come in, come in. - I had a run-in with Herr Pabst. - Pabst? - So, I think it's better if I leave town. Harry, you really oughta start thinking about getting out of town, too. He knows you were Quinn's friend. - I've got some business to take care of first, Maggie. - I have the diamonds, Harry. - You have? - Yeah. You know, it's funny I had Quinn figured all wrong. I mean I never would've guessed he was involved with getting people out of Europe. - Don't those diamonds have to be in Lisbon by Wednesday? - Yeah, and I'm gonna take 'em. - You are? - There's a flight leaving for Lisbon tonight. - Maggie, that could be very dangerous. - Something I gotta do. - Well, you think you know how to handle it? - I check into the Hotel Iberia under Quinn's name, and I wait for the phone to ring. - Be careful. - I'm glad you didn't ask me to be good. I couldn't promise that. (knocking) (speaking in a foreign language) - Come in. Would you not make up the room now, and just put towels in the bathroom. Thank you. Sorry, Maggie. - That's all right, I'm gonna have to go anyway. - I think you're very brave. - No, just determined. Wanna give a pretty girl a push? - Mm-hm. I'll see you around, Maggie. - See you around, Harry. - Yes, never mind just give me (speaking in a foreign language) That's right, thank you. (speaking in a foreign language) - There are some people who want to talk with you. (dramatic music) - You were arrested with her! - [Henry] Yes, I was! - And you talked with the Gestapo. - [Henry] Yes, of course. - Did you betray her for money? - No, of course not. - Or to save your own skin? - Well, you've guys have got it all wrong here. - Hey, listen do you want me to have you shot? - Shot? Now, wait a second I think there's been a sort of misunderstanding here. Her gardener found a radio antenna wire on the roof and he took it to Pabst. - Why should I believe you? - When your boys picked me up I was desperate I was trying to find a way to get her out. - All alone? - Yes, all alone, dammit! I didn't have your phone number! Well, don't you realize this is the best thing that could've happened to us. We need each other. I know where she is. I've been there. I know exactly where they're holding her. I know the layout of the place, and I think I know a way in! (speaking in a foreign language) - Can you draw us a map of the fortress? - Before or after I'm shot? - Why are you so stubborn?! Don't be such a stubborn fool! We shall begin again from the beginning. One question at a time. When you answer them, I shall have you untied, given something to eat, allowed to rest, but if you do not, madame, then you know what will happen. What is your radio code frequency? Oh come now. That is not so difficult. I'm not asking you to betray anyone. Just a number, that's all it is. I shall ask you once more. Katrina, what is your radio frequency? We shall start with your arm. Gunther. (screams) (dramatic music) (speaking in a foreign language) - First thing we need to find is the staircase. (speaking in a foreign language) - Easy, easy. (bottle clinking) Shh! All right, c'mon, c'mon. (yelling in a foreign language) (speaking in a foreign language) (dramatic music) (gun fires) (guns firing) - Harry! - There's a war going on. A bunch of your friends from Marseilles. - Can you get me out? - [Henry] Stand back. - [Katrina] Someone's coming. (gun fires) - C'mon! - [Katrina] Look out! - C'mon. Jeanot! I've got her! We're gonna have to jump. - Oh Harry, I hate to tell you this, but I have a terrible fear of heights. - That's okay, as long as you don't have a fear of jumping. - Drop that gun! (dramatic music) And you madame, move over there! - Do as he says. (gun fires) - Are you all right? - I'm not dead. Right, hold on now. Do you think you can make it? - [Katrina] Yes. - All right. There's a plane leaving for Lisbon in 40 minutes, and we could be on it. - Well, I obviously can't function in Monte Carlo anymore. - I'd say your career as a spy in Europe is kaput. - Yes, maybe my career in America could be kind of interesting. I've had lots of offers. - Well, they'd love you in the states. - Yeah? - Almost as much as I love you. Now look, we'll just take it a day at a time, Katrina. There'll be no commitments, no strings. - And no rain checks. - Right. - Harry, you know one of the things that I love about you best? - What? - You never take no for an answer. - Well, are you saying yes? - Yes, I never thought I'd say it again. - Well, do you mean it? - Oh yes. - Well, say it. - I mean it, I love you!
