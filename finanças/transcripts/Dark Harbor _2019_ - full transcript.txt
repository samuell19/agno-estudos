(suspenseful music) - [Child] APS Films. - [Man] Another glass? - [Woman] I had one. - [Man] Today? Just don't understand why you have to drink. - I'm not drinking. - You just had another glass! - [Woman] Why do you feel this need to control everything that I do? - I am concerned. - Oh, really? You're concerned? - Here we go. - Don't do that. - I have given you no reason not to trust me. - Really? Because I see the way that you talk to your co-workers. - They're my co-workers. - And your texts back and forth, what's her name again? - These are your own god damn issues that you have to get over. I have been faithful to you, Olivia! - Yeah. For now. - Okay, so you're gonna crucify me for something I have not done. Meanwhile, I come in here, and you're drinking! (glass smashes) I'm done. (door clacks) (muffled scream) (whiskey splashes) (phone vibrates) (Olivia sighs) - Happy birthday, Dad. - [Father] So I have to call you, huh? - I'm sorry. - No, no, I know you're busy. Too busy for your dad. - How was your day? - How was my day, well, your mother's taking me out to dinner. - Lucky you. - So how about you, kiddo? Are you doin' okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. - Are you sure about that? - Miss you. - I know, I miss you, too. Look, why don't you come home, huh? - [Olivia] You know I can't do that. Can't be around her. - Yeah, I know. (muffled footsteps clack) (knocks on glass) Hey, sweetheart, hold on one sec. (window whines) (suspenseful music) Yeah, can I help you? - Dad? (phone bleeps) Hello? (phone rings) (phone bleeps) - [Man] The search continues for famed children's book author, Stanley Prescott. - [Woman] We all love him so much. I pray to God that he's okay. - [Man] But how does somebody like Stanley Prescott just go missing? He's the most important person on the friggin' island. - [Man] I mean, he's definitely the wealthiest. (chuckles) - [Man] But him and his wife always give back to the community. - [Man] They do, they do. - [Woman] I spoke with Father James yesterday. He said "don't give up on Stanley." - [Man] I'll be honest with you, I don't think he's on the island. - [Man] You think he took off? - [Man] I'll be surprised if his body washes up on shore. (ominous orchestral music) (distant boat horn blows) (wings flap) (crickets chirp) (door creaks) - She's a good picture-taker. Olivia's in New York now and she is taking pictures, which is some sort of hobby. (coughs) There she finally is. - Hello. - Olivia. Look at you, you have that wonderful baby glow. - Beautiful. (Olivia chuckles) - I thought you would be here by three. - Any word? - Nothing, no. They're still searching. - They're going to find your father, I know it. - (laughs) Well, probably run off with some whore. - [Woman] Jesus, Susan, don't say such a thing! - [Susan] He's never home. (water splashes) (footsteps clack) - [Woman] Hey, you shouldn't be doing those. - It's fine. - You know, I remember when I was pregnant, I used to send Chris out in the middle of the night, because I was craving pineapples. He'd play music for Darren when he was still in my belly. He'd sing to him. - Thought about adoption. - Oh, well, you know, there's a lot of couples out there that can't have children. A baby is a blessing from God, and God gave him to us for a reason, so. - I have to go to the bathroom. (dark orchestral music) (footsteps clack) (bulb buzzes) (sniffles) - Yeah. I know. (knocks on glass) (window whines) (phone bleeps) - Do you really think he'd run off with someone else? (Susan chuckles) - We went out to dinner once and um, this fan of his, some fan, she was old enough, I mean, she was Olivia's age. The way they talked to each other. - Mom, you have no... (knocks) (suspenseful music) - (sighs) Okay. (knocks) (door creaks) Thank you so much, sweetie, you remember Olivia? - Thank you. (solemn piano music) (inhales sharply) - They used the wrong shade on his face, it's too dark. It's so sweet of you to come. - I'm so sorry. - Thank you, you know Olivia? - Thank you for coming. - Thank you. I can't bare to talk to anyone else, I... - Why don't you get some air? - Because I have to be a good host. Olivia, people came all this way to show their respects. - Okay. (door slams) - Who is that, Olivia, do you know, standing there? - Nope, I don't know her. - (scoffs) Were we not just talking about bad makeup? Caked on like a French hooker. - Don't do this. - It's offensive. Presenting herself that way at my husband's wake. (woman sobs) She was sleeping with him. - I can't believe you'd bring that up again. - She ignored us completely. (door slams) (Olivia scoffs) - He would never do that to us. - You didn't know him like I did. He became disinterested in me after I gave birth to you. (phone vibrates) (woman sobs) - Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation? Or persecution or famine? (camera snaps) Or nakedness or peril or sword? As it is written for thy sake, we are killed all day long. We are accounted as sheep for the slaughter. Nay, in all these things, we are more than conquerors, through him that loved us. For I am convinced that neither death, nor life, nor angels, nor demons, nor powers, nor things present, nor things things to come, nor height, nor depth, nor any other creature shall be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ, Jesus, our Lord. Amen. ("Moonlight Sonata") - Your father was such an extraordinary man, Olivia. He touched so many others with his work. I'll always remember him at the children's hospital, reading from his books. - (chuckles) Yeah, me too. - How long is it you stay home? - I'm actually leaving tomorrow. I'm having the baby in New York and I'm due in two days. - Two days? Gosh, that soon. (Olivia chuckles) Well, congratulations. A baby is a blessing from God. - So I've heard. - You know, I don't mean to be presumptuous, but, as you may or may not know, your father was a big contributor with our church. We'd be fortunate, fortunate and grateful, if that were to continue. - I'll talk to my mother. - She stopped coming a few years ago. - She didn't say. - I know the relationship that Stanley had with Christ. It's what he would've wanted. - Then I'm sure it'll be in the will, Father. Thank you for the service, it was beautiful. - I'm surprised you haven't poured yourself a glass of wine yet. - Don't worry, I won't embarrass you. - What did the priest want? - Tried to shake me down for money. Said Dad always made contributions. - Why didn't he ask me? - [Olivia] He said you don't go to the church anymore. - No, I do not. Did he tell you why? - Didn't ask. - Well... (footsteps clack) You know, I still care about all of these people, even if they want nothing to do with me. (chuckles) - Everyone's here to support you, Mom. - It's for your father, not for me. - Funerals are for the living, not the dead. (somber orchestral music) - That is the silliest thing I've ever heard. (Olivia chuckles) (phone vibrates) (Olivia sighs) (car approaches) (suspenseful music) (engine hums) (camera snaps) (engine roars) (distant boat horn blows) (gulls squawk) (background chatter) (distant music) - The town's getting zoning in place to put a statue up near the ferry terminal. You should be proud. - Listen, the last time I talked to him, our conversation was cut short. - Yeah, I saw that in your statement. Listen, his death was ruled a heart attack. There was no evidence of foul play. - It's just that it... It seems strange. - We both know how awful cell service is on this island. Right? - [Man] (chuckles) Hey, Chief! Good to see ya here. - Kellen. - Miss Prescott. I just wanna say, I'm so sorry. Anyone that goes through something like that, but especially you, I mean, Stanley was an inspiration to me. I grew up reading him books. - Thank you. - What brings you to this side of the bay? - Farmers' market. - Well, thank you, Kellen. - Yeah. All right. It's good seeing you, nice to meet you. (bell rings) - I imagine this kind of thing happens a lot these days. - Yeah. I like hearing from people who admired him. It's nice. (door creaks) (clock ticks) Mom, are you okay? - Olivia... (clears throat) How did the funeral pictures turn out? - I don't know, I haven't really gone through them. - I was thinking about what you said yesterday, about Father James shaking you down for money. What an awful thing to say, with everything he's done. - Okay? - I'm gonna make a sizeable donation to them, after we sell the sailboat. How much should we give them, do you think? - I don't know. How much is the sailboat worth? - Ah. (distant boat horn blows) I have no idea. We've got all these things now, Olivia, and I don't know how or who... Who'll have all that he's left to... What do you want for dinner? Wow. That was fast. Your father's barely cold in the ground. - I'm due any day, and I'm having the baby in New York. - Yes, well, you've cut your mother completely out of that process, haven't you? - God, Mom, not everything is about you. (somber orchestral music) - I am all alone. I'm all alone now. (Olivia sighs) - I'm taking Dad's car. (footsteps clack) (clock ticks) (water splashes) (distant boat horn blows) (background chatter) (faint string music) - Good evening, miss. Can I grab you a sparkling water to start? - Actually, could I grab a glass of Malbec? - Yeah, sure. - Hi! Kellen. We met earlier at the coffee shop. - Farmers' market? - Yeah, (chuckles) yeah. - Right. (chuckles) - Small world. You know, the ferry doesn't run after seven. You're about to be stuck on the mainland. Mind if I sit? - [Waiter] We have a Malbec for the lady. And will you be joining us this evening as well, sir? - Um... - [Waiter] All right, how about a drink? - I'll have what she's havin'. And an order of the ricotta and braised leek crostini. - [Waiter] Perfect. - How's that sound? (Olivia chuckles) Look at you, you are just glowing. (chuckles) And you have a lovely smile. God, I'm making it awkward, all right, tell me. You're not going back to the island, where are you goin'? - I live in New York. - New York? - Mm-hm. - I've never been there, how is it? Do you love it? - It's, uh, you know. - No, I don't know, (chuckles) what else? - I don't know, it's a big city. Lots of buildings and subways and... - You are so descriptive. (both laugh) - A Malbec for you. - Awesome. - And a menu. - Thank you. Well, what now? How about a toast? To men like your father, who've changed the lives of so many people around the world. Including me. Cheers. (glasses clink) - Thank you for saying that. - Well, it should be said. You're gonna have to forgive me when I say I really envy you. You're about to start this incredible journey. There's something about being a parent I've noticed, especially in mothers. They possess this unconditional love. It's really incredible to see. I hope to one day have that for someone. I'd do anything to be in your position. To be a... Father. - If you'll just excuse me, I'm gonna use the restroom really quickly. - Oh, right, baby bladder, yeah. (chuckles) I'll save your crostini. (Olivia chuckles) (ominous tones) (water splashes) (somber orchestral music) (Olivia sighs) (Olivia chuckles) (Olivia giggles) - You're crazy, that's funny. (laughs) I gotta say, you have lived a full life. (chuckles) And now you're gonna be a mother. - Yeah. - You're gonna be a great one. (Olivia chuckles) And your daughter is gonna get the best of everything. You know? Experiences and schools, and she's gonna travel the world and... - Not end up in Maine. - Yeah, that's what I was trying to say! (chuckles) - Oh, it's not a bad place to come back to, though. Yeah. - Sure. And she will go back to the city. As her... Gosh, it's strange to think about. Which, who knows, well, it's not what you had. (Olivia chuckles) And maybe better. - Yeah. What I had. I am bringing a baby into this world... And I don't wanna end up like my mom. (chuckles) And Greg. Greg is great, you know, he's a really good guy and he's gonna be a good dad. But, you know, it would just crush me if I broke him. Like my mom broke my dad. There's just a lot of unhappiness there. That's the first time I've ever said that out loud. - Well, it takes a lot of strength to say that. I've always believed that strength is something that... (heartbeat thuds) (muffled chatter) (Olivia breaths heavily) (tense music) You okay? - Yeah. Oh, Jesus. - You know, the Lord cries when you say that. (cutlery clinks) Oh, um, hey, can we get a check? It's okay. - [Manager] Is everything okay here, sir? - Yeah, everything's just fine, thank you. - [Manager] How much did she have to drink? - She had one glass of wine. - One glass? - All right, just relax, come on, honey. - Sir. - Oh, right. This should take care of everything. I think she's going into labor. - Labor? Should we call an ambulance? - [Keller] No, no, no, I have it, thank you. - I guess she's going into labor. She's gonna have a baby! (patrons applaud) - Okay, right through here, honey, let's go. Shh, shh. Sir? 24, please, thank you. Okay, honey, we're gonna get you home. You'll be fine. - Is she okay? - Yeah, a little pregnancy sickness, thank you. That's us. - Oh, no. - Come on. Right in there, honey. All right, watch your head. It's gonna be just fine. (tires screech) (engine roars) (tire bangs and hisses) No. (door creaks) (dark orchestral music) (keys clink) (door creaks) (grunts) (car approaches) (siren wails) (door clicks) (hushed chatter) - [Radio] Copy that, 10-four. - [Officer] How's it going over there? - It's going good. (bolt clunks) - You okay? (suspenseful music) - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, it's just, you know. - [Officer] You had anything to drink tonight? (tools clang) (Kellen sighs) - No, sir. - Who's this now? - I was just taking her home. We were having supper at the restaurant. She fell asleep, she's pregnant. - She's a friend of yours? - Yes, sir, family friend. - What restaurant? - [Kellen] What's that? - What restaurant? - Oh, de Lucio's, de Lucio's. - They make a mad chicken parm. - Yeah, yeah, I haven't had anything there that I didn't like, actually. (chuckles) - Hey, you know, I got a friend over there. Steve. - Yeah, Steve, yeah, oh man. He makes a Manhattan out of this world, I'm tellin' ya. Not that I had one tonight. (chuckles) (officer chuckles) - Hey, you mind if I wake her up? - No, I don't mind. Sure, go ahead. She might, though. (chuckles) - (grunts) I'll let the lady sleep. Save you some trouble, right? - Oh, appreciate it. (officer chuckles) - All right, you got it from here? - Yeah. I think so. - [Officer] All right, I'll wait over here till you're done. - Appreciate it, thank you. - You have a good night now. - You too, officer. (door thuds) (engine starts) (dark orchestral music) (door slams) (bulb crackles) (sighs) (laughs) (sighs) (wind blows) (muffled classical music) How you feelin'? There's a glass of water next to ya. - What happened? - You got sick. At the restaurant? - Sick? - Yeah. (distant clang) Oh, that's my mother. (distant scraping) I would've taken you home but I didn't know where you lived. You couldn't tell me. - I'm sorry, I don't remember what happened. - Tell ya what, we'll talk everything over breakfast. - Where's my purse? - [Kellen] Let's talk first. - I have to go. (Kellen sniffs) - Mm! You smell that? (eggs sizzle) (spatula scrapes) - Not there. (spatula scrapes) Not there, either. Back to the window. (spatula scrapes) - Thank you. - Uh, Regina? (pan thuds) - What? - Olivia said thank you. - Yeah, I heard her. (door creaks) - I apologize. - [Boy] Paper's on time. - Charlie, this is Olivia. - That chair's always empty. - [Kellen] It's okay, Charlie. She's gonna be joining us for breakfast. (sighs) - Is she your friend? - She is our friend. - Well, we know one thing, you didn't get her pregnant. (tense orchestral music) - That's not appropriate. - (groans) I'm sorry. - That's okay. (chuckles) (Regina pants) (chuckles) Let's pray. Dear Heavenly Father. - Why have you been following me? (Kellen sighs) - I haven't been completely honest with you and I apologize. That is to say, (chuckles) I knew your father. Regina knew your father. Charlie is your father's son. - I swear to God if you talk... - Please. Do not use the Lord's name in vain in this house. - Jesus, okay, I'm leaving. - Damn it, sit! Now! Sit. Now. I'm so sorry. Listen, I know this is hard to hear. Especially that Stanley's been paying us off to keep this quiet. As you can see, it hasn't been much. Though we're humble servants of God, we don't need much. Do we? But the fact remains, Charlie, has a legal right to what's been left for you. He is Stanley's flesh and blood. - Bullshit. - Okay, well, I'd say the same thing, if I was sittin' where you're sittin' but, imagine what the headlines would say, if we went to court. I didn't wanna do that, I came to you first, because I think that you deserve the courtesy of choosing to do what's right, and... The opportunity to meet your brother, face to face. One way or another, you're gonna give me half of that inheritance, so I can give Charlie the life he deserves. (thud) (door slams) Charlie? Charlie. - I told him it was a bad idea to bring you here. (chuckles) Soon you'll find out what it's like to bring a child into this world alone. The only difference is, you'll be able to afford it. - I'm truly sorry about the pain of your father's betrayal. I pray God gives you the strength to do what's right. Give place unto wrath, vengeance is mine to repay. Olivia? Your father was a monster. But he's given you an incredible gift. This opportunity. - I was 15 when I had Kellen. Did my best. (water splashes) - Any bruises? - No. And I checked the baby's heart rate, it's fine. - [Chief] Your ordered a blood and urine test? - Of course. - Okay. Listen, Olivia, I'm sorry. I gotta run through this one more time. When you woke up, you were fully clothed? - Yes. - [Chief] And then what happened? - And then his mom made me breakfast. - Regina? - Yes, Regina. - Why didn't you leave then? - Because he didn't give me back my purse yet. - And then what? - [Olivia] And then he threatened me. - How so? - (sighs) He said "vengeance is mine to repay." I think it's from the Bible. He wouldn't stop talking about it. - Why would he say that, "vengeance," "vengeance is mine?" - I don't know. - Hm. (sighs) Okay, look, I gotta be honest. I don't have enough to charge him with anything. (sighs) I'll do what I can to make sure he leaves you alone. (door slams) (lock clicks) - Olivia? What're you doing here? I thought you were going to New York to have your baby? Am I to simply expect to see you whirling in and out of my house whenever you feel like it? You know, I deserve some respect and a little consideration. I have just lost my husband. You have always been the most competitive, manipulative, you pitted your father and me against each other for years. - You did that. That was you, Mom. God, you even blame me for Dad cheating on you. - Your father hated me, because of you. - No, he didn't. - Yes, he did, because he wanted a son. And after you were born, I couldn't give him one. - Then why'd you stay? - Because it was my duty. I sacrificed everything for you. - Well, I didn't ask you to do that, so you don't get to hold that over my head for the rest of my life. - When you have your child, then you will know how I feel being your mother. (Olivia scoffs) (distant dog barks) (lobster shell cracks) (lobster meat squelches) (Kellen chuckles) - Hello, Chief. - Kellen. (clears throat) Thank you, Susie, and um, a beer for the young man. You need to leave Olivia Prescott alone. - I don't know what you're talkin' about. Did I do something wrong? (Chief clears his throat) - So what happened last night? - Oh, I ran into her at supper. - You just happened to run into her? (Kellen chuckles) - I go to de Lucia's all the time. Great chicken parm. You know Steve, the bartender? - Okay. - Well, okay, so let's get one thing clear. She, asked me, to join her. I didn't wanna be rude, I obliged. She's very pleasant. Couple laughs, she's really charming. Then she got sick. And I took her home. (lobster shell cracks) - She thinks you did more than just take her home, Kellen. (lobster meat squelches) - Chief. What could I possibly do? - Old habits die hard. - I've paid for my sins. I've changed. - She went to go see Dr. Baker this morning. They called me. You better pray to god those tests come back negative. You understand me? (tense orchestral music) Enjoy your beer. (phone rings) - [Greg] Hi, you've reached the law firm of Greg Barner and Associates. Please leave a message. (phone vibrates) - Hey. - [Greg] Hey, is it time? Hello? - No. - Is everything okay? (Olivia sighs) I've been trying to call you. - I know. - Do you need anything? - No, I'm fine. I'm sorry. - [Greg] Me too. - Goodnight. (Greg sighs) (clock ticks) (knocks) (footsteps clack) - Good mornin'! - Good morning, can I help you? - Yeah, uh, so sorry to bother you, Miss Prescott. We haven't actually formally been introduced, but I'm a friend of Olivia's. - Uh-huh. Hello. - I know it's early, again. - Yes, it's quite early. (Kellen laughs) - Again, I apologize. You see, there was this misunderstandin' the other day, and I wanted to come by, and I'd love to talk to your daughter, and just clear everything up. And those are some lovely earrings, might I add. Wow. - Oh, thank you, they were a gift. Olivia is asleep right now, so I will tell her that... - Kellen. - Kellen, I will tell her that Kellen stopped by. - Great. - Good to see you. - Oh, you know what, Miss Prescott? I got on the first ferry over this mornin'. (laughs) It is not easy gettin' on this island. - No, the ferry's the only way, yeah. - Yeah, so if you wouldn't mind, I'd prefer to just come inside and wait. I hadn't gotten in my prayers yet this mornin', and I won't be any trouble, I assure ya. - I'm sorry, you wanna come into my house to pray? - Yeah, I'm a member of the Mother of Mercy Church, right across the bay, perhaps you know Father James? - I do know Father James. (clears throat) (sighs) Yep. (lock clicks) (door creaks) - He's a mentor of mine. - Is he now? Well, please, come in. (door creaks) (chuckles) - So sorry to hear about Stanley, he was quite the man. - [Susan] Thank you. - I've heard this property is breathtaking, but the rumors don't do it justice, Miss Prescott. - Well, it was Stanley's dream, his design. (clears throat) Feels empty without him in it. - Oh. I'm sure the Lord will find a way to fill it with comfort. Yes, Stanley was the pride of Dark Harbor. (chuckles) Wasn't he? - Yes, he was. Did you know him? - Who didn't know Stanley? - And how do you know Olivia? - Long-time friends. - Really? She never mentioned you, but don't take it personally. She doesn't tell me much. (chuckles) - Oh, it's okay, I'm sure she's under a lot of stress with the baby soon to arrive. - Mm-hm. Well, I don't think a baby was much on her agenda, whatever she thought her agenda might be. I don't think she would've continued the pregnancy without the influence of the boyfriend who is now the ex-boyfriend. I think, I don't know, it's hard to keep track. (joyful piano music) (Kellen chuckles) It's nice to meet a young man who has such an appreciation for music. (Kellen chuckles) - Well, I'd love to play another, but, that's the only song I know. (chuckles) - It's a good start. You know, when I play, I try to imagine that each of the notes is my innermost feelings. (muffled chatter) (tense orchestral music) - Hello. - I'll make some coffee, I'll be back in a minute. (Kellen chuckles) - You went to the chief. Why? - What did you do to me? - I took care of you. I was concerned, about the baby. (music swells) (slap) - It'll just be another minute or two. - I'm afraid I have to go. I'll tell Father James you said hello. It's a pleasure meeting you, Miss Prescott. - I'll walk you out. - [Kellen] I didn't know what else to do, Father. I've never seen a sign so clearly. - I don't think you understand. - No, Father, I understand everything now. - If you have respect for the church and you have respect for me, then you'll do as I say and you'll leave the Prescotts alone. - How can you side with them? - I'm not siding with anyone. I'm protecting you. - [Kellen] From who? - From yourself. - Hah! You think you're my savior now? (Father James sighs) - Faith is something that takes a lifetime to understand. - I'm beginning to question your convictions, Father. Let me ask you somethin'. I was three months in. I had a bullseye on my back from day one. The woman I raped had a brother in my cellblock. What're the odds? On Sunday mornin', they cornered me in the showers. I figured I was gonna catch a beatin'. Maybe they'd teach me a lesson. Then they may even have their way with me. But instead, I saw a blade. It's funny, at first I couldn't feel a thing. I just watched the blood flood down my leg. Has anything like that ever happened to you, Father? - No. It hasn't. - So when you talk about understanding faith, no amount of time compares to an experience like that. You have a lot to learn, Father. (muffled door thuds) (door creaks) - [Chief] Hey, Regina. - Robert. - What happened? - I fell. - That so? - Yeah. What can I do for you? - I spoke with Kellen last night. I need to talk to him again. Is he here? - No. - You call me immediately if he stops by. - Is he in trouble again? - Call me, Regina. (door thuds) (engine starts) (gulls squawk) (distant boat horn blows) - I didn't wanna believe a single part of what he said, but when I looked into Charlie's eyes, I just, I, I saw this piece of myself. - What do you suppose it is that frightens you about the idea of Charlie being your brother? (Olivia chuckles) - My entire life has been a betrayal. And I never really knew the man that I loved most. - You know, Olivia, you... Your father was protecting you, he knew what having an illegitimate child would do to your mother, and in turn, how that would affect you. Your father wasn't perfect. He loved in ways he shouldn't have. He, um... He asked me to set up a trust for Charlie, and I did. You see, your father was concerned that Regina wouldn't be able to manage the money herself and... I kept your father's secret. That's why I approached you the way I did at the funeral. And I'm sorry. I'm sorry you had to find out the way you did. - It's not right, Father. - It's not always about how others define what's right. Humanity is choosing what's best for others. Now, if you want, if you're not comfortable with the situation, you can build your own trust. - It's not about the money. (chuckles) I have a brother. - Yeah. (chuckles) (phone vibrates) - Hello? - [Robert] Olivia, hi, it's Chief Sanders. Listen, Dr. Baker got the results back from your blood test. They did find traces of rohypnol in your system. I'm sorry. - Okay. (door creaks) - We need to talk about Charlie. (door creaks) - I need to make sure that Charlie is provided for. - I'm gonna do everything that I can for him. - The child support? (tense orchestral music) - It will continue. But I wanna do more for him. (sighs) We want Charlie safe. Just until Kellen is in custody. It's not safe here. (Regina sobs) - You know, I offered to have an abortion when I got pregnant with Charlie, but your father wouldn't let me. - Did he love you? - He loved you. Okay, you take Charlie. I'm gonna stay here and I'll call Chief Sanders as soon as Kellen gets home. - Okay. - Thank you. (door creaks) - Oh. (pants) - [Regina] Are you okay? - Yeah. Yeah, I'm fine. (tense orchestral music) (wind howls) (fire crackles) (classical piano music) - (scoffs) Where's Charlie? - Chief Sanders is looking for you. - Oh, okay. - He's gonna put you away for good, Kellen. - I'm tryin' to get this family what we deserve. - You're ruining everything for Charlie. - Charlie needs a father! - You're not his father! (Kellen chuckles) - [Kellen] Charlie! Charlie! (muffled clattering) - No, no, no! - Where's Charlie? - He's not here. - You gave him to the Prescotts, didn't you? - [Regina] Yeah, I did! - [Kellen] Why? - I'm not gonna let you ruin his life! - Olivia doesn't even want her own daughter. They're sinners! - Yeah, look at you, casting stones! (tense orchestral music) I wish I had aborted you when I had a... (Kellen grunts) (thud) (grunts) (slap) No, no! (oven clicks) (gasps and chokes) (fire crackles) (classical piano music) (door creaks) - [Olivia] Mom, this is... - Hello, Charlie. (sighs) I've known for years. About all the money and all the lies and all the women. And you two thought you were so clever, didn't you? That son of a bitch was never faithful. You knew. You knew and you covered it up for years. (scoffs) Shame on you. (somber music) He was brilliant and he meant so much to so many. He lit up every room that he walked into, and everybody loved him. And I loved him. So I kept it quiet, I didn't say anything. But it was my silence that started eating away at me, until it hurt you. As you grew up, I grew more and more distant, and you didn't deserve it. You didn't deserve it. I'm sorry. Oh, God, I'm... I, I'm sorry, I... (Olivia sighs) - I'm sorry, too. - You have nothing to be sorry about. Nothing. (chuckles) Well. I'm Susan. (phone vibrates) - [Olivia] Hello? - Charlie, why don't you come over here and look at these books? I think you'll find them very interesting. - [Robert] Olivia, where are you? - I'm home. - Listen, we found Regina almost beaten to death at her home. They're rushing her to the hospital right now. Kellen's still missing. - What? - [Robert] She has another son, Charlie, he's missing too. - [Olivia] He's here. - [Robert] Excuse me? - [Olivia] Charlie's here, I have him, he's safe. - [Robert] I'm on my way, don't move. Olivia. - Yeah. - Stay inside. Keep the doors locked, I'll be there as soon as I can. (Olivia sighs) (footsteps clack) - [Susan] What's happened? - They're taking Charlie's mom to the hospital. And they're still looking for Kellen. - Kellen? Who was here? - Yeah, he's Charlie's half-brother. Chief Sanders is on the way, so we should be ready to go when he gets here. - My mom used to read these to me when I was younger. I don't think we have any of them anymore. (suspenseful music) - [Kellen] Your father was a monster. - No, no, no. - Olivia! - Oh, no, no. - Come with me, come on. Come on, keep breathing. Breathe, sweetie. (Olivia groans) Breathe, breathe with me. Just breathe, sweetie, just breathe. It's okay, it's okay. (Olivia pants and groans) It's okay, it's okay, I'm here, I'm here. (door rattles) - Charlie. Come lock the door behind me. - It's okay, I've got you, I've got you, I've got you. (door creaks) (locks clicks) - [Father James] Kellen? Can we talk? (wind whistles) (Olivia groans) - I know, sweetie, I know. Just breathe, short, quick breaths. (both pant sharply) You're doing fine, Olivia, it's gonna be okay. Here it comes again, okay. Okay, hold my hand, hold my hand, now squeeze. (Olivia groans) Squeeze. - Kellen? Can we talk? - Hold my hand, I'm here, sweetie. Squeeze my hand, Olivia, it's gonna be okay. She's coming, she's coming. (Olivia groans) You're doing fine, you're doing fine. - [Father James] There's nothing to be afraid of. (wood creaks) - It's about time, it's about time. Look at me, I want you to bear down and I want you to push! I want you to push! Push, Olivia, push! (Olivia grunts) (siren wails) (Olivia groans) You're gonna be fine. (giggles) Here she comes! (Olivia pants) (Olivia groans) (giggles) (baby cries) (warm orchestral music) (baby cries) Say hi to momma. (baby cries) Oh, she's beautiful. (Olivia chuckles and pants) (door creaks) (chuckles) - Everyone okay? - She's fine. They're fine, everything's fine. (ominous orchestral music) Oh, oh! (Kellen grunts) No, God, no! (blood splashes) (Robert chokes) (body clunks) - Kellen. (Robert groans) (suspenseful music) What have you done? (Kellen pants) - [Kellen] Hey, Charlie. Why don't you come over here and stand with me? - Let's leave the boy out of this, hm? - I'm not talkin' to you. Charlie? Come over here. - No, no, I wanna go home. - I wanna show you somethin', buddy. - Leave the boy alone. - Father, you don't know what the boy needs. God knows what he needs. And I'm doing God's work. - Do you really believe that? - Once upon a time, there was a boy named Kellen, who took beatin' after beatin' after beatin'. Needless to say, his daddy was a real piece of shit. Then one day, along came a man named Stanley. Stanley had the opportunity and the means, to help Kellen, and he chose not to help him. Why not? What kind of sick prick immortalizes a kid as a worm? I ask you. (sighs) And the days rolled on until Kellen came to collect, and Stanley was eaten by worms, and breathed his last. That's a good one. - You killed him, you killed my husband. - Oh, I wanted to. The old coward had a heart attack. It was a let-down. But God knew what a man he was, and delivered him to me, as an offering. And all was made right. (Susan grunts) Uh-uh. (grunts) - No! (groans) - Listen, put it down. Just put it down. That's enough. I don't want to do this. - You're so weak. You're not gonna pull that trigger. - Kellen. Let's stop, hm? - I'll put it down, I'll put it down. (metal clangs) (Father James yelps) (metal thuds) This is God's plan. (chuckles) That baby has been delivered to me. I'm the father. - [Susan] Dear God, no, no. - Move, move. - Oh, dear God, no. - No, no. (guns cocks) (gasps) No! - Move! - No! God! (knife scrapes) - Let the children, come to me. (knife slices) Do not hinder them. For the kingdom of heaven belongs to such as these, shh. (baby cries) (chuckles) (baby cries) Charlie, can you go fetch us a bowl of water? Priest James, I'm gonna need you to get up. Olivia, you too. It's time for the baptism. (baby cries) Come on, come on, come on. Good boy. Olivia, I'm gonna need to stand, please. (baby cries) Come on up. Join the family. - Oh, no. - We're a family now. We're ready. Isn't she precious? (kiss) (chuckles) Bless my baby. - Yeah. And even as John the Baptist came forth from the water, they thought him mad. (music swells) (flesh squelches) (Kellen groans) (sharp thuds) (Kellen groans) Stay back, stay back. (Olivia grunts) (sharp rapid thuds) (flames roar) (sharp rapid thuds) (Olivia pants) (peaceful orchestral music) And so, in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit, I christen you, Charlotte McKinley Prescott. (door thuds) - Charlie. - She's a beautiful girl. So how are ya, are you okay? - Still having nightmares. - I think we always will. - Look after my mom for me. - Of course, of course I will. How about your father? - What about him? - You think you'll find it in your heart to forgive him? (distant boat horn blows) Forgiveness, Olivia. It's the best medicine for the heart. You be well now. You take care of yourself. - You take good pictures. - [Olivia] You all packed for the city? - Yeah. - Hey, Charlie, can I see that? (peaceful orchestral music) (camera snaps) (Charlotte babbles) (camera snaps) (somber orchestral music)
