* Narrator: In the early days of western america, the Indians first lived without fear of the white man. They had their villages, chiefs, medicine men, and family. They hunted, feasted, danced, and loved. In general, they were a happy lot. They had many superstitions, one of which was the firm belief that death and destruction would befall any one of them who forsook the land of his birth. For this reason, they loved, celebrated, and even worshiped the sun, hills, valleys, clouds, rains, and rivers that gave them their life, their piece on earth. * sun, wind, sky * wild bird waking * paling stars * day now breaking * from on high * small plume winging * soon you'll come * blue-red Willow singing * sweet love song * my flute calling * o'er the hills * sunlight calling * from on high * wild bird coming * heart, my heart * hush now thy welcoming How, chief eagle-feather. I have good news sent to you from Washington. And, oh, yes, many gifts sent to your people from father Sullivan, including this for you. Oh, the padre always remember. Him good to my people. Now, tell me news from Washington. Well, chief, it seems that your peacefulness and cooperation with the government has won you some favor, and it's been decided that you and your people may live here on the land of your forefathers forever-- or until you break your word and war against the white man. Then that is forever. We ask nothing more. Oh, but there is more, chief eagle-feather. Since Eddie here has become Indian agent, he's really been pitching for ya. Already he's arranged an increase of 200 head of cattle to be sent to you by spring. True? Yes, I convinced the government that, due to the shortage of buffalo, you needed more cattle. Good boy, Eddie. What father Sullivan send? Oh, the gifts-- I'll get 'em. He's got a gob of stuff for ya. White Fawn, I hear it won't be long before you'll be becoming a bride. Father Sullivan sent these to further adorn your pretty neck for the occasion. ( Speaks in tribal tongue ) Oh, and he didn't forget you, young bear. He didn't forget your weakness for a big hat. Here, try it on. See how it looks. Him truly our brother. Him understand Indian problems. Well, he should. He's practically an Indian himself. Why, you raised him from a kid, didn't you? Hello, Duke. Got your message about the meeting. What's on your mind? Chico's in town. He gave me a few ideas that might prove very interesting. Let's pick up Glen Matthews on the way. Right. Hello. Hello, chico. Glad you're here. Howdy. Sit down. What's so important we have to have a meeting in the middle of the week? I'll get to that in a minute. First I want to acquaint chico with our position. As you already know, Mr. Matthews, mr.Rockwood, and myself are the select men elected by the citizens to run the town and county affairs. They've invested in US the power to act as we see fit. However, we don't like to include the township in some of our more, uh... Profitable deals. So, you see, we still have to be very careful. Nobody's wise to US yet, boss. Nevertheless, I still want to impress on you why you're on the payroll. I get ya. I called you men together because I feel that our plan to run chief eagle-feather and his tribe out of the antelope valley is not working acc-- "not working"?! I just finished recording 60 acres in our names this morning. If you'd let me finish, Glen, you might learn something. When I said our plan was not working, I meant to say it was not working fast enough. We don't have the cooperation of the federal government of the states, so I don't see how else we're gonna rid those savages. That's where chico comes in. He tells me he knows a band of outlaw Indians who can be hired. "Outlaw Indians"?! Yeah. When Indians commit crimes, their tribes throw them out forever. They usually gang up and really go wild. They'll stop at nothing to throw bad light on their own people who banished them. What would you have them do? Plenty of things, and it'll all be blamed on the peaceful tribes in the antelope valley. That sounds like a perfect idea! When we as a select men of bow city report to Washington that they've broken their treaty, chief eagle-feather and his tribe will be driven 100 miles back into the wilderness. Then, we move in, stake our claims, the land becomes ours... That's all there is to it. Matthews: It'll work. I know it'll work. Say, boss, that land ain't worth much. What's so valuable in that valley? Silver. That valley is a veritable sea of silver. And we may as well get something for our honorary positions as select men-- besides glory. Where do I cut in, besides being on the payroll? You'll be taken care of, chico. In fact, we're recording the next claim in your name. Yeah. If you don't mind, I'll take mine in cash. Suit yourself, chico, but you know what to do. Yeah. I know what to do. Them Indians ain't moved out yet. You know the boss's orders. He said get rid of many where we see fit, and that means only one thing. ( Gasps ) ( Boy cries ) ( Speaks in native tongue ) Two Indians killed! Come on! ( Drums play ) Don't cry. Who dunnit? White men. Did you recognize 'em? No. I hate to see a kid left alone so young. It happened to me when I was about his size. What are we gonna do with him? We can't leave him here. Me take him. Some of US will care for him. If you don't mind, chief, we'll take him to the compound, to father Sullivan, where he'll be cared for right. I'll see to it that he is. Uh-oh, I see we're gonna have an adoption right now. He's a cute little tyke, though. Looks just like a little, brown jug. What's his name, chief? All I know, him Indian-Charlie's boy. Well, from now on he's little-brown-jug to me. And I give you my word, I'll find out who's responsible for what happened and see to it that whoever's guilty is punished. This is not the first time my people been killed or beaten for no cause. Me make peace with white man, but him no make peace with my people. Why? I assure you it isn't the government that's behind these outrages. Well, somebody's raising trouble with the Indians. Yeah... Some perp is behind these attacks, all right. I intend to find out who it is. If you'll give US a little time, we'll get to the bottom of it. That you will have, my boy, but I warn you, my people very uneasy, ready for war. I'll work as fast as I can. * my wife and I live all alone * * in a little brown hut we call our own * * she likes gin and I like rum * * I tell you boys, we sure have fun * * ha ha ha, you and me * * little-brown-jug I do love thee * I never did see a critter get so dirty in so few years. Don't you worry. When I get through with you, you'll shine like polished copper. Father Sullivan, you know what i'm gonna do with him? What? I'm gonna make a cowboy out of him. Yes, sir, that's just what I'm gonna do. A real-live cowboy. Eddie tells me he's gonna make a lawyer out of him so he can carry on the fight for his people, and I have a few ideas what I'm gonna make out of him. He'll probably wind up making something different out of all of US. Already you're his caretaker and his teacher, and I'm his nursemaid-- hey! ( Laughing ) Oh! Here. Where are ya? Here. ( Laughs ) Give it to me. You have it. Here. What did you do that for? A little refreshment, captain? Thank you, father. I sent for you, captain Hadley, because I felt that you, being in charge of the fort here, could see your way clear to station a few of your troops here at the compound in bow city. Well, the damn near presence would quiet things until we could complete an investigation. To be perfectly honest with you, Eddie, I see no reason for your alarm. If I were to do as you suggest, I'm afraid it would look like we were asking for trouble from the Indians. But those Indians have a treaty with Washington. Surely they deserve some kind of protection. My hands are tied on that score. There's nothing I can do for chief eagle-feather or any of his tribe without orders from the government. After all, my job is to protect US Americans. Them Indians is more American than you are! I appreciate that, but gentlemen, my situation here is rather difficult. While I'd like to help them, I can't make a move without orders from my superiors, and, by the way, um... While we're on the subject, that child-- according to rules, he has no right to be off his reservation. He's an Indian. Me no Indian. Me cowboy. I'm arranging to adopt him, captain Hadley. Besides, he's just a little boy. An Indian's an Indian. Good day, gentlemen. They're very few of US who really try to understand the Indians. Yes. They're a people who are being whipped by deeds far beyond their understanding. Men like US enjoy and appreciate their happy philosophy. Yet some men laugh at their suffering. Here, where English, Irish, Scotts, Italians-- men of every race, color, and creed meet. Why can't the Indian be one of US? We're all his children. I wouldn't take it so hard, father. But don't you see that these murderous attacks on these people are allowed to continue? The only natural course for them is to take up arms against US. That'll be the undoing of all I tried to teach them. My life's work will have gone for nothing. And yours, too, Eddie. You worked a long time to become Indian agent. ( Chuckles ) Well, you have. There are other ways of handling things. Good afternoon, gentlemen. The only time you visit US, father, is when you want something for your Indians. What is it this time? I've come to ask for your help. For what? For their protection against renegade white men. I know you run things here, and as the town's leaders, if you post a reward for whoever is molesting those unfortunates, you'll put a stop to it all. Where would we get the money for a reward? You know the town has no funds, and our position as select men is purely gratis. Maybe he'd like US to stick our hands down our own pockets. Maybe I would. Maybe I feel that you'd feel better if you had a chance to do some good in the world. You're barking up the wrong tree if you expect any help from US. But I thought if I explained that it's been-- you have explained enough! If it wasn't for your cajoling those cannibals, they'd have all been executed a long time ago. And another thing-- as far as that church of yours is concerned, I think the community could get along just as well without it. I wouldn't be too sure of that. I've been looking all over for you, father. We're ready to ride if you are. Thank you, my son, and thank you, gentlemen. For your kind understanding. What you said is true-- any community can do without a church, but think how much better a community can be with one, especially for those who want it... Let alone those who need it. I knew as soon as he got that appointment as Indian agent he'd make trouble for US. Listen, he's been aiming for US ever since we took office. He doesn't respect our position or our authority. He will before we get through with him. I've already sent a complaint on his management of the Indians to his superior commissioner rife. He's due here anytime now. We might even get him removed as Indian agent. ( Coughs ) Would you have a clove, father? No, thanks, Ezra. Oh, you don't want it. Those are the rifles I promised you, wild-horse. We'll start with the stage. Anything you get is yours, plus anything you want when the job is done. Savvy? Very savvy. There'll be plenty jobs comin' up. We'll watch for the stage over here. Care for a bite, melody? No, thanks. Well, take it anyway. You're not eating enough. When your parents engaged me to chaperone you, they warned me of your finicky appetite. If we're gonna make it all the way to Europe, to complete your education, you've got to eat something. Would you join US in a bite? Huh? Oh, no, thanks. How 'bout you? I haven't digested the last one you gave me yet. ( Gunshot ) Indians! Get going! ( Gunshots continue ) Look! It's Indians! Indians? Woman: They after US? What do you think? ( Ladies scream ) ( Gunshots continue ) I wonder what he-- what do you think he's gonna do? Whatever it is, he's gonna need some help. Well, come on. Whoa! Well, I wonder where we are now. Man: You all right, miss melody? Melody: I'll be all right. Man: I never heard of such a thing in this territory. Is anyone injured? The driver and the guard are hurt pretty bad. Are you folks all right? Luckily we are, thanks to you. They told US if we took the southern trail we wouldn't be bothered with Indians. This is unusual for this part of the territory, isn't it? Yeah, very... And it puzzles me. These men should be taken to the compound quickly. All right, father. Better get loaded. Look, mister, we can't go back to the compound. I've got to catch a boat for Europe. And boats don't wait. Is that more important than saving these men's lives? We'd better do as he says. Come on. Come on, let's go. What do you make of it, Eddie? Do you think chief eagle-feather broke his word? No, I'm sure he hasn't. It might be some of the tribe has taken it on themselves to avenge the death of Indian Charlie. If that's true, it involves the lives of hundreds of people, and the fate of that whole tribe. We must try and stop it. Well,the driver and the guard are gonna be all right. Then how soon can we leave? That's something I can't answer right now. Well, can't you order other drivers? It isn't the case of drivers, it's the safety of you passengers I'm thinking about. Well, we're willing to take the chance. We have passage on the queen Victoria from New Orleans, and it's my duty to see we make it. I'm a lawyer, Mr. Dean. I've got a case to defend back in Kansas City. I've been preparing for weeks, if I'm not there, my client will lose his shirt. ( Chuckles ) And if you try to get there, you're liable to lose your scalp. You'd look funny in court without any scalp, wouldn't you? ( Laughs ) Uh... If you can't control the Indians, they better get somebody in here who can. Man: I'm gonna take this up with higher authorities. I'm a whiskey salesman. Stopping this coach throws me off my whole schedule. A whiskey salesman, huh? You got any samples? Get away from that case, there's none for you. I was afraid of that. I'm sorry, folks. But as Indian agent, it's my duty to avoid trouble. This stage does not go through until I'm sure it's safe. Where are you going now? Going to do a little investigating. Well, must we wait until you get back? Looks that way. Well, I'm not waiting. I'm going with ya. I wanted to talk to you before I did anything about that raid. Eagle-feather made promise make no trouble. Eagle-feather keep promise. Then, none of the tribe is responsible? We keep peace. Well, it's got me stumped. They were Indians. I saw them myself. Maybe...outlaw Indians. Maybe wild-horse. Wild-horse? Is he back in the territory? Oh, him back. My brave see him. Then he's who caused all the trouble. I felt all along it wasn't any of the tribe... But I had to make sure. My people trust you, that we shall not be driven from our homes into the hills. I'll do everything in my power to prevent that. No, thank you. Dean: Better take it. But it's too valuable. Take it anyway. I'll explain later. Thank you, white Fawn. ( Speaks tribal language ) What did you say to her? I told her you would treasure it forever. You see, the Indians have many unusual customs. If they give you jewelry and you accept it, it means a sealing of lasting friendship. I'm so glad you told me. Another romantic notion they have-- if a boy and a girl look at a waterfall together, and he should sing to her, she falls in love. Of course, there's nothing to it... Unless you believe that way. * everything under the sun * has a love song * and someone or something to sing that love song to * * I've heard each one * to some loved one call * but the sweetest of all * is the song of the waterfall * * I hear through the dunes in the park * * the love song of the waterfall * * and there it mingles through the trees * * a love song born upon the breeze * * floating over rugged rocks * hear the water sigh * come to me where you are * * dear one, here am I * for this is heaven's waiting heart * * the love song of the water fall * You know, miss melody, some people forget that Indians are human beings just like anyone else, and that they need an education just as bad as any other people. Now, when you get yours, if you decide to take up school teaching, there'll be a fine job waiting for you here. Don't go getting any funny notions about me. The last kind of job I'd like to have, and the last place in the world I'd like to have it. There. Eddie, you have to admit he's the finest-looking cowboy that ever walked the plain. Here, son. My, my, but that hat is certainly becoming. It sure is. No, there's something wrong. Huh? Ezra, get me a bowl. A bowl? Uh-huh. Father, do you have a pair of scissors? Coming right up. There. I wonder why I didn't think of that. Maybe it's because you've been eating too many cloves. ( Laughs ) Here, jug, what do you think of it? Me look funny, me look like you. ( Laughter ) Here. Where's my horse? Oh, your horse? We'll get you a horse as soon as we find one that fits you. That's gonna be a job. I don't know how we're gonna find it, but we'll find it for ya, you bet your life. Occurs entirely too often, captain, and we feel it's our duty to see that something's done about it. We can't wait for commissioner rife to arrive. We sent word for Dean to meet you here. There he comes now. Howdy. You sent for me, captain Hadley? Yeah, sit down, Eddie. Thanks. These gentlemen sent for you because they felt, as Indian agent, you'd sign a report that eagle-feather and his tribe have broken their treaty. Well, that's not true. I've investigated every raid, and I'm sure it's wild-horse and his band of outlaws who are responsible. Wild-horse, eagle-feather, and the other Indians, they're all alike. They're not to be trusted. Chief eagle-feather swears that his tribe is not guilty. He's telling the truth. He could be lying. He wouldn't lie to me. I'm the same as a son to him. Tell you what I'll do, Eddie. I'll hold off doing anything against the Indians if you'll bring eagle-feather in for a little talk. If he can convince me as he has you of the innocence of his people, I'll give you some men and my full cooperation to capture wild-horse and whoever else is behind this trouble. Fair enough. I'll bring him in. Well, we got him just as you ordered. Yeah? He's gentle as a lamb. Got plenty of fire, though. Well, where is he? Father Sullivan is holding him down the street there. ( Ezra laughs ) Why, he's perfect, Ezra. This is gonna make brown-jug the happiest boy in the world. * I'm riding the trail to dreamland * * to meet the one I love * I'm riding the trail to dreamland * * guided by the stars above * ride along * ride along * on a range that's blooming with bluebirds * * ride away * ride away * oh, my journey soon will be over * * I'm heading where someone's waiting * * the one I'm dreaming of * I'm riding the trail to dreamland * * to meet the one I love * * ride along * ride along * on a range that's blooming with clovers * * ride away * ride away * oh, my journey soon will be over * * I'm heading where someone's waiting * * the one I'm dreaming of * I'm riding the trail to dreamland * * to meet the one I love hey, Eddie? Huh? Oh! You singing about that gal back at the compound? Well, I did have her in mind. Yeah, the way she feels about you, is the only dreamland you'll ever know is when she hits you over the head with a flat iron. ( All laugh ) You and your jokes. ( Laughs ) What are you laughin' about? Shut up. Come on, let's get goin'. Little-brown-jug, I think your waiting days are just about over. Look over there by the gate. Little-brown-jug: Whoopee! ( Melody laughs ) Not so fast now. Do you remember what we rehearsed? Yes, ma'am. Now, don't forget! Well, cowboy, here's that pony we've been promising you, and he's all yours. My humble words of gratitude can I convey in you, my sincere appreciation for your benevolent generosity. What kind of language has he been learning? ( Father Sullivan laughs ) Mount up. * one-little, two-little, three-little Indians, * * four-little, five-little, six-little Indians * * seven-little, eight-little, nine-little Indians * * ten little Indian boys * ooh, ten-little, nine-little, eight-little Indians * * seven-little, six-little, five-little Indians * * four-little, three-little, two-little Indians * * one little Indian boy * one-little, two-little, three-little cowboys, * * four-little, five-little, six-little cowboys * * seven-little, eight-little, nine-little cowboys * * ten great, big cowboys Ezra: * ten-little, nine-little, eight-little cowboys * * seven-little, six-little, nine-little cowboys * * six-little, three-little, four-little cowboys * * two little cowboys, one little cowboy * ( all laugh ) And that's the way it's been, commissioner, one raid after another. Why, there's hardly a citizen in the whole town who can venture outside of his own door without fear for his life. Commissioner rife, you've arrived just in time to avert a disaster to this entire community. We've tried to reason with your agent Eddie Dean but, having been raised by the Indians himself, we feel that he's prejudiced. Sounds very serious. It is! ( Footsteps approach ) Howdy, commissioner rife. Hello, Dean. This is a surprise. I didn't know you were coming to town. Why didn't you notify me things were in such a bad state? It was nothing captain Hadley and I couldn't straighten out. Didn't feel it was necessary to bother you. Merely a renegade situation. I've been informed differently. I've been convinced your Indians have broken their treaty, and for your failure in reporting it, I'm removing you as Indian agent. We got tired of complaining to you and seeing nothing done about it. But commissioner, captain Hadley agreed to let me bring the chief for a hearing. It's entirely out of your hands now, and until I can appoint a new man, I'll take charge. Captain Hadley, I'll accompany you to fort bend and get enough troops to drive that tribe clear out of this part of the country, back into the hills. As you say, Mr. Commissioner. Commissioner, I tell you you're wrong. Those people are innocent of the charges. A war on them now without reason would ruin the peace we've been trying to bring about. You'll lose civilization along this frontier back ten years. Don't listen to him. You're hearing an Indian talk. No, but you're gonna hear one talk whether you like it or not. I'm still bringing in chief eagle-feather to tell his side of the story. I'm sure, commissioner, you're interested only in facts-- the terrible facts which speak for themselves. This whole thing has boiled up to a dangerous point, and I'm not taking any chances here with no men. Captain Hadley, you and I are riding over to the fort to get the troops immediately. Hold eagle-feather here until we get back. At least we'll hear what he has to say. I'm taking this matter into my own hands. If they believe you, it'll be our only chance to avoid more suffering for your people. My people ready to make war. They believe you failed them. I haven't failed them yet. That's why you must come with me. Uh-huh, me go. Tell young-bird to keep them quiet. ( Speaks tribal language ) When commissioner rife and captain Hadley get back, they're to have a meeting with eagle-feather. You know what that would do to US. We've got to prevent that meeting. We've got to get rid of Eddie Dean, too. It's only a matter of time to get on to our plan to get the antelope valley in our possession. You've got to work fast, chico, and make no mistakes. Don't worry. Hyah! Eagle-feather and Eddie d. Will be along any minute now. There they are! ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshots ) Wild-horse! We're plenty outnumbered! Run for it! They'll try to make the compound. There they go! Renegade Indians! Indians? You got it. Here, chief. You'll be safer here. Stay down. What's going on out here? What's all the confusion? You ever use one of these? I can try. Well, you'd better. My pony! Jug! Jug! Come back! ( Gunshot ) ( Gunshot ) Let's go. Chico! Poor little-brown-jug. He'll ride no more. By his own people. They weren't all Indians out there, Eddie. I recognized chico. Dead? What are you gonna do? This time, I'm going hunting. I'm picking up their trail. Well, by George, I'm going with ya, then. Hey, Eddie! Go to your hideout, wild-horse. I'll get your money and bring it to ya. You follow wild-horse, see where he goes. I'll follow chico. I'll follow him, but I won't get close to him! You can drop that. It might be easier on you, chico, if you did a little explaining. You're not telling me what to do! Lock this man up, Marshall. What's the charge? Murder. I'll hunt up judge cummings and arrange a hearing. I hope you know what you're doing. I do, that's why I brought you along. I may need a witness. That Marshall's not a real lawman, he's just an appointee, and unless I miss my guess, he's just as crooked as the rest. How are you gonna prove it? If he lets chico out. What will that tell you? He'll run to whoever he's working for and tip them off. That's who I want. Get up the street and tell Marx what's happened. Hurry! Eddie, you certainly know your men. Yeah, there's one thing I don't know-- that's the why and wherefore-- but I have an idea how to find out. Where are you going? Into the recording office. Eddie, do you feel this is the proper procedure for US to take? The proper procedure is not the question when trying to prove the guilt of real criminals. I know he's somewhere in town 'cause he told the Marshall he'd look up judge cummings. This makes it perfect. He's played right into our hands. With the evidence of the Indian raid and his siding with them against US, we've got every right to kill him on sight. All I hope is I see him first. Here's something interesting, father. These are claims to every Indian's land in antelope valley, including Indian Charlie's. Now, they've been recorded under the names of Jim rockwood, Glen Matthews, and Duke Marx. Will this open commisioner rife's eyes? The answers to the who, but not as to the why. That land is very fertile, but not worth killing over. That's where you're wrong, father. That valley has vast deposits of silver. Whoever tries to cash-in on it, why, their returns would be fabulous. Silver? Are you sure? I've known it a long time. I was hoping no other white man would ever know it, because I realize the unhappiness a man's greed can cause the Indians. Now I understand. This is a showdown, father. Eddie, can't you settle this without further bloodshed? I can try. There's a lot to pay for. It'll be up to them. Wild-horse, I thought I told you to stay at the hideout till you heard from me. Me wait, you no come. Your job was to nail eagle-feather and Dean. You slipped up on both. You don't get paid off till you complete the job. They're here in town somewhere. ( Horses approaching ) Boy, have I had a merry chase. I located them renegade Indian's hideout, but they led me right back here into town. Then we can get them all together. Yeah, but you realize we're outnumbered? Ezra: Look, there's plenty of 'em. Can't you get any help in this town? No, the good ones are afraid of them, and the bad ones are with them. Father, you better go back to the compound. No. My place is here with you, but let me reason with them. All right. But they're plenty tough. I'll say they're tough. And there's only one way to get under their skin, and that's with lead. We can try my way first. We'll split up and get them. No... It's bad luck to kill a padre. Duke Marx, I'm asking you and your men to lay down your guns. Keep out of this and stay where you are, padre. It does not come within your right to take a life. Quit your preachin'! I advise you not to take another step. We haven't got a chance. I hope you don't run out of ammunition, Eddie! Gettin' mighty low! ( Cheering and yelling ) Ha! Ha! Eagle-feather! I'm harmless! I like Indians! ( Yells in tribal language ) Hey, Eddie. Whew! Yeah, eagle-feather and his braves sure saved the day for US! Yeah. Wonder how he knew we needed him. You can lay the blame of that on me. I tipped him off where to find wild-horse. My only worry was he wouldn't get here in time! Ezra... This time I'll have one. What?! Oh, why, sure, padre! Uh-uh-uh. I mean a clove. Oh, a clove! Oh, yeah, sure. I'm glad that's all you wanted. ( All laugh ) Here. Don't forget my lunch basket. Goodbye, father. Goodbye, my son. Thanks for your hospitality. I've enjoyed it even though it was forced on me. And I hope you win your lawsuit. Thanks, father. Can I help you with your case? Get away from my whiskey samples. You've sampled enough. All right. I'll have my own, then. Well, we're ready to leave now, and in addition to saying goodbye, I want you to know how happy we are that you've been restored as Indian agent. Thanks, miss twichle. And one more thing-- remember, whatever happens happens for the best. ( Chuckles ) Oh, yes, yes. I hope you and miss melody have a nice trip. Ezra: All aboard! Come on, miss twichle! Well, goodbye. Goodbye. Goodbye, father. Goodbye, miss twichle. All right, get rolling! Well, thanks to you, father Sullivan's gonna have a mighty fine school teacher to help him out with his work. What? Look who's sittin' right over there. * sweet love song * my tune calling * o'er the hills * sunlight falling * from on high * wild bird coming * hark, my heart * thou can have thy loving
