I know how much you've been looking forward to today's lessons of the mechanics of sexual intercourse. Too many people are embarrassed or ashamed about the very natural act of sexual intercourse. - Come right in. Uh, go right ahead with your class, Miss Copuletta. We'll just stand here for a tiny moment. - Yes, of course, Miss Dutchbok. Thank you. Now then, during sexual intercourse, the male undergoes certain biological changes which cause his organ to become erect. Now, after a short length of time, the male organ releases its fertile cargo... - Thank you very much, Miss Copuletta. That was very stimulating. Come, ladies, let's go to lunch. We have a lovely lunch in the cafeteria! We're having chicken! - Miss Copuletta? Uh, which do you think is the most important in a penis, length or width? - Well, I don't think that we have the time to get into that today. I mean, we don't have the time today to talk about that.

This is three dozen for 5.99. - I'll take them. - However, I don't know if I'd trust them. They've been on the shelf for quite some time. Now, we have this new product here. These are multicolored and ribbed. - Oh, that would be just fine. - No, I don't think so. I don't think you want anything that tawdry, do you? No, no. Or do you? - No. - No. No, what you want is something really reliable, huh? - Yeah. - Yep. Well, I have sold literally miles and miles of these and I've never had any complaints.

I love you. - And I love you, too, Jimbo. - What happened? - Jordan was on the extension! - Those scumbags! - I love you. - Hey, big boy. Think you're man enough to score with me? - I am if Bubba is. - Oops, sorry! Tonight I have to wash my hair. - What? - Oh, Jim! - Do you think I'm doing the right thing? With Jim, I mean. I guess I'm kinda scared. Bets, have you ever really done it? All the way? - Well, yes and no. - What do you mean, "Yes and no?" Don't you know? - Bubba says we did it once and that it was very good for both of us. But I was passed out. I don't remember a thing. - Well, it's not gonna be like that for me. What else does Bubba say? - He says that I had three orgasms, that I begged him for mercy and that I said I've never seen a man so well endowed. - Well, is he? - Is he what? - Is he well endowed? - I don't really know. I mean, not firsthand. Just from what Bubba tells me. - Jordan thinks that length is most important. What do you think? - I think width. - Why width? - Because Jordan thinks length. - All right, girls, let's get a move on. We're gonna be late for practice. Who slammed? - Hey, Jordan, how's it going? - Who slammed? Cut it out with the slamming! - Hut! - Only a floater, Jim. We go deep, make a play. Okay, all right! - Okay, let's see it! All right!

If you don't deserve punishment, I'm sure each of you will think of something you have done to deserve it in the past. Dismissed! - But Miss Dutchbok, I didn't do anything... - Now, now, now, now, now, now, now, Jordan, dear, I'm doing this for your own good. You'll thank me for it in future years. Run along, dear. - Ah! - Oh, Coach Whelan, pull yourself together. Oh, dear! Here, drink this, it'll do you good. - Oh, no. I couldn't possibly.

Where's the old pizzazz? - Oh, yeah. - Ah, come on, you've got the hottest girl here chasing after you and you're depressed? Why don't you just forget dumb old Chris and give Jordan a chance? - I don't ever wanna hear you say anything bad about Chris again! - Okay, okay. - What's wrong with him? - I don't know, something about Chris. - Why, Jim! I didn't expect to see you here today. How you doing, son? - Well, not too good, actually, Mr. Ramsay. It's Chris. We had a misunderstanding. It's all my fault, but Chris won't even talk to me now. - Well, Chris has a mind of her own, you know that. But I'll put in a good word for you, if you like. - Thanks a lot, Mr. Ramsay. Thank you very much. - Good morning, we're delighted to welcome you to Parents Day at Cherryvale. Refreshments are now being served at the pool, and a full schedule of activities has been planned for your enjoyment. - Here you go, Daddy. - Thank you, sweetheart. Mm, give me another one of these, would you? - Are you sure? Okay. - Oh! I don't have to tell you, Coach Whelan, how vital today's Parents Day is to the economic future of Cherryvale. - Yes, Miss Dutchbok, that's right. - Oh! Which reminds me, dear, excuse me. - Uh, Jordan. Jordan, dear. - Yes, Miss Dutchbok? - I'm so eager to meet your father, but it is getting rather late, dear. - Late? Miss Dutchbok, my father is always late. My father likes to be late so he can make an entrance. - Aha. Well, if he doesn't arrive soon, I'll just run up to the parking area to make sure he hasn't lost his way. - Whatever you say. - You look so nice, dear. - She's not gonna like me. I know it! - Nonsense. Jordan loves all her new mommies and you're no exception. Come on, what does little Bambi-wambi say to the great big growly bear? - I wuv you! - Mm-hmm! No more baby talk! - Chauncey is watching. - Chauncey, drive! - Stand aside, young man! Make way! - Dad, you remember my roommate, Jordan? - Very pleased to see you again, Mr. Flugel. - Jordan! Little Jordan! You and Rita have been so close, I just feel like a second daddy to you. Yes, ma'am, you just think of yourself as Frank Flugel's little girl anytime. Isn't that right, Rita? - Oh! Stop, Mr. Flugel! - Oh, what's going on here? - I'm giving Bubba another chance. - After what he did? - What the hell? Maybe you should give Jim a break, too. Come on, you didn't give up those hotel reservations, did you? See, look at it this way. I'm gonna forgive Bubba. Compared to Bubba, Jim's a saint. - Compared to Bubba, anybody's a saint. - Nice driving, Chauncey. - Oh, I'm so glad you enjoyed it, sir. - Come on, check it out! I got dubs. - Make way, gentlemen, please! We won't be needing any assistance this afternoon! Get out of the way! - Let me get it! - Don't touch the car, please. - Right. - Jordan. - Daddy! - You are as beautiful as ever! Oh, I uh, I want you to meet Bambi, your new stepmother. - How do you do? - What happened to the last one, Mrs. Lawrence Leigh-Jensen number seven? - Now, now, Jordan, let's not behave like a cross child. We're all here to have fun. We want to meet all your friends. Oh, where is that lovely Miss Dutchbok whom I've been corresponding with, hmm? Mm! - Have a little cherry tomato. - Mm! Yeah, good. Mm! - Hey, sweetheart! What class are you in? - I'm not in any class, I'm a teacher here. - Oh, so what do you teach? - Sex education. - What? - Sex education. - Sex education? That's my favorite subject! - All right. Here, right here, right here. Here you go. Well, back, back, back, back, I'll handle this now. My dear, I need to give you a little help here. Back up, back up. - Mm! - Hmm? - Mm! - I think she's gonna be all right. - I guess we should talk. - Nothing happened between me and Jordan. I love you. - Hello! Hello! Yoohoo! Hoo-hoo! Yoohoo! Welcome. Welcome to Cherryvale. I'm Miss Prudence Dutchbok. - Charmed. - Oh! And I've already guessed who you are. Oh, yes, Jordan speaks of you ceaselessly. She's so proud of her father. - Oh. - And your kind letters and continued support of Cherryvale. I think you're a remarkable man. - Mademoiselle, you are far too kind. - Oh, I hope you'll allow me to give you a personal tour of the school! - Well, I can think of nothing that I would like better. - Oh, I know you're interested in seeing the site for the new wing. Uh, unfortunately, we, it's been difficult raising funds for the construction beginning, but... - Well, now, let's not go another step further. Oh, dear, I seem to have left my checkbook in the car. Would you mind accompanying me back to the car, Miss Dutchbok? - Oh! Oh, I'd love it, and please call me Prudence. - Very well, Prudence. - Oh! Oh! I don't want to take up too much of your time, Mr. Leigh-Jensen. May I call you Mr. Leigh-Jensen? - If you wish. - I'm sure Jordan will be anxious to see you. She's probably wondering where you are. - Don't worry. No one is gonna find us in here. - Try this. Oh! - Oh, oh! What are you doing? - Does it displease you? - Dutchbok? - It doesn't displease me that much. But do you suppose while you're doing that, my darling, you could write that check? - Well, of course I could, darling. Here, here, let me help you with these buttons. - These buttons? - Yes, they're so binding. I wouldn't want anything to bind you. - I'll take care of the buttons, you take care of the check. - As you wish, dearest. Damn! - What is it? - I've dropped my pen. - Oh, I'll get it. Oh! Ooh! - Forgive me, Prudence. A rash impulse. I couldn't resist. - No need to apologize. The check, dearest? - Oh, yes, yes, of course. Damn! - The pen? - No, no, the check. I've dropped the check. - Well, let me. Oh! Oh, oh, stop that! Ooh, ah! Stop! Don't! Stop! Don't! Oh, my God, use both hands! - But I need one to write the check. - Oh, forget the goddamn check! Use both hands! - Do you like it like this? - Oh, yes! Yes! Don't be so gentle! - Well, then how about this? - Oh! Ah! Yes! Yes! - And this? - Yes! Yes, yes! Hey, wait a minute! Wait a minute! Wait a minute. Something strange is happening here. - There's nothing strange about two people trying to give each other pleasure, no matter how bizarre the means. - I know. - And by the way, if you're turned on to rubber garments, I happen to have... - Oh, shut up, you fool! Our voices! It's almost as if they're amplified! - You get off of him! - What are you doing? - Oh, you, miserable... You, you bit me! I didn't like you at first and I don't like you any better now! - Stop! - Let me go! Get off me! - You bad, bad, bad boy! Let me out! - Uh-oh! - What do you want me to do? - I don't care! - What do you want me to do? - You can't do a damn thing! - What do you want me to do? - Never, never, never, never, never! - Let the boy go! - I never liked you, either! - Will you please stop? - Holy shit! - Whose car is this? - Oh! - Hey, Bubba! - Bubba? - Home, take me home! - Was that my car? - What did I do? - I nearly died! - What did I do? - You hit the emergency brake! - Get your paws off my derriere! Mama said there would be men like you! - Hey, hey! - Hey. - How's it going? - It's going. - Okay, you two, have a really great time. Don't do anything I wouldn't do. - Right. - Blow in her ear. It really gets broads hot. - Thanks for the advice, Bubba. - Pinch her boobs. It'll drive her crazy. - Great. I don't know what I'd do without you. - Hey. - Bye. - Okay, read me the current spread. - Let's see. All right. The odds against you getting her into the dorm are two to one. Now, if you do get her there, the odds against you getting any of her clothes off are four to one. It's seven to one against you getting her top off. - Piece of cake, Roy, piece of cake. - But it's nine to one against you getting any actual bare tit! It's 12 to one against you getting down to her panties. And 15 to one against you getting her mother-ass naked. 22 to one against you scoring in any way, shape or form! - Yeehaw! I'm gonna be rich! Hello, can I speak to Jordan Leigh-Jensen, please? Hello, Jordan? This is Bubba. - Nice place. - Oh, yeah, nice. - How long ago did you say your parents stayed here? - Uh, 23 years ago, on their honeymoon. - May I help you? - I'm the graphic designer. - Excuse me? - I called you on the phone. I made a reservation on the phone. Do you remember? - And what name did you give? - Well, what name do you have? - Excuse me? - What I believe my wife is trying to say is that she telephoned about a week ago. The name is Green. - Green, Green. No, no, I'm afraid I have no Mr. Green. - It might be under Ramsay. - Ramsay, Ramsay, Ramsay. - Or possibly Jones. - Jones, Jones, ah, yes, here we are. Mr. and Mrs. Rams-Jones. The honeymoon suite. - There's late night entertainment in our piano bar. Of course, you have your world famous sunsets on the D'Amour beach. And for a slight additional charge, the Jacuzzi and the tennis courts. Well, here we are. - Is this the honeymoon suite? - They're all honeymoon suites since the remodeling. And I hope that you have a pleasant stay. - Thank you. - Oh! Thank you. Thank you very much, sir. You could tape them together. Well! So, what do you think? - It's nice. It's very nice. I wonder if this is anything like when Mom and Dad stayed here. Wow, look at this. - Hey, pretty fancy, huh? This tub looks like it could hold both of us. I mean, if we wanted it to. - Look at this view. - Yeah. - Someone's at the door. - So what? Uh, relax, will you? Who's there? - Some complimentary pink champagne, Mr. Rams-Jones. - Hey, thank you. - Well, okay! Okay, enjoy it. - Thank you. Wow, complimentary champagne. This must've cost a mint. - Uh-oh. - What's wrong? - Well, there aren't any glasses. - Well, we can drink out of the plastic ones in the bathroom. - Nah, don't be silly. I'll call room service. I'm dying to give that guy a tip again. ♪ Best years of our lives ♪ - Is that her? Woo! - I can't believe it!

How are we supposed to know how far you get, huh? - Yeah, you don't expect us to take his word for it, do you? - Good as gold. The man's word is as good as gold. Trust me. - Oh, trust him! - Bubba's told the truth every time! - Hold it! I'll tell you what, you get in the closet with Roy, the rest of you assholes, out. - Hey, how come he gets to watch and not us? - Are you in on this with Bubba and Roy? - Sam, every time we... - Hold up here!

Four to one clothes off. Seven to one top off. 12 to one panties down. 22 to one score city. Who's in? - 10 more down on panties! - Don't even mention it. I'd do anything for that guy. But I'll tell you, Jordan, if he weren't my best buddy, I'd have to put the old moves on you myself. - Really, now? But what about Betsy? - Betsy? Betsy's an amusing girl, but she and I are just good friends. - I got you both down. ♪ Makes me wanna dance oh ♪ ♪ It's a new romance ♪ - Well, that's Jim's side.

Welcome to the 86th Commencement Exercises of Cherryvale Academy. Well, the year is finally at an end. It has been a long, hard struggle, but, girls, we've pulled together, and now you have finally completed your studies. I see your teachers aglow with the satisfaction of a job well done. I see... I see... Never! Your parents, secure in the knowledge that their daughters have received the very best. And, you graduates, I see your joy. The justifiable pride in your accomplishments. The excitement as you go forward into your futures. You've blossomed from awkward adolescence into the full bloom of young womanhood. But with this joy comes a tug at the throat. A tiny sorrow. A tender nostalgia. - Look out! - Hey, watch it, Mack. - I can remember my own days here as a student. And certainly, a day like today comes a wide array of varied emotions. In future years, you'll reflect upon your years here and remember them, I am certain, as the happiest time of your life. What of my own feelings? Well, we have had our ups and downs, but I shall miss your shining faces, even as you go forth to fulfill your bright promise. And now I shall yield the floor to Miss Newhouse, who, for reasons I don't pretend to understand, has been elected to make the farewell remarks on behalf of the graduates. - Sunny days? - Sunny days. Thank you, Miss Dutchbok. On behalf of the entire graduating class, I'd like to thank you for all you've done for us. No, you won't be seeing our shining faces anymore. Here's something you can always remember us by. Ready, girls? - Graduation, Cherryvale! You won't forget us soon! Sunny days ahead of us! We leave behind this moon! - Way to go! - Woo!
