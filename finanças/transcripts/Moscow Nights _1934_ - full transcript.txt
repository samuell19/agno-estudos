# You, it's you... # #...that makes our land fertile, Volga... # Thirty! Thirty-one! Oh! - Thirty-two! Thirty-three! Thirty-four! Thirty-five! Thirty-six! Thirty-seven! Thirty-eight! We must get on with it, day and night! No breaks. The army needs bread day and night, you get me? I get you... - Form multiple teams, ...pay them double, it's worth it! This is war, we're not here for the fun of it. What's that? Forty-two! - Oh, the scum! Halt! Hey! Halt! Is this what you call work, you?! You call this work, you pussy? You're embarrassing the others! - You think it's so easy, you do it! Follow me, people! One! Two! Come on 219! 220! 221! 222! 223! I'm going to Iaroslav's bridge, if there's any news, let me know. The parcels have gone to Moscow? - Yes, chief. If my fiancée's gifts don't arrive, ...I'll crack your skull! - Don't worry, chief. They'll all be in Moscow tonight. - All the better for your skull. Allez hup! Day and night, eh? - Yes. Goodbye, chief. Bon voyage! Operating theatre! - Got it. Operating theatre. 211. Second floor. - 211, ...second floor. 109. Operating theatre. - 109, operating theatre. 211! 211, operated on in the train. Remake the dressings, get some rest. Battery! Fire! Charge! Fire! Fire! Fire! Who are you? Where am I? But... what happened to me? Who are you? - Shush. You don't yet have permission to speak. You're in hospital, in Moscow. I am nurse Natalie. You've been delirious for six days. But now, all is well. You're sure I'm not dreaming? Be sensible. Try to sleep. - I'm wide awake. Shush. It's late. If you want something, you can ring. Will it be you who comes? - No. I'm going home. When will you be back? - Tomorrow morning. Without fail? I'll try. Be sensible, you'll wake your neighbour. I'm not sleepy! People, please stop your chattering and you'll be asleep soon enough As you command. Good night! Good night. - Good night. Let me introduce myself: Captain Polonsky. Captain Ignatoff. Pleased to meet you. I hope that we get along. I'm sure we will. Tell me, before anything else, there's something I must know. Yeah! Who is nurse Natalie? Exactly. Well, she's the daughter of the late General Kovrine. While he was alive, such disgrace wouldn't have been possible. Never would the Kovrines have had to sell their daughters. Oh no! Never! You're the one who should be ashamed to talk like that. Your brother left us a mortgaged house, a legacy of misery and a surplus of debts! Nothing but debts. - Yes... Therefore my niece has to marry this gilded brute! He loves Natacha, he's crazy about her. There's a man here who's traveled by the Volga, sent by Mr. Brioukhoff. - Show him in. Piotr Petrovitch sends his greetings and gifts for Natalia Alexandrovna. He'll be in Moscow in three days. - Thank you, my good man. Make him some dinner. Don't forget a little drinkie. Thank you very much, madame. Well? What do you say about this? And it's like this all the time! What a man! Ah! Natacha... Good evening, uncle. - Good evening, my girl. Good evening, mummy. - Good evening. I'm dead tired. We have a hundred more wounded than we have staff. Yes, oh... it's lunacy. You're going to make yourself ill. Piotr Petrovitch doesn't approve of you straining yourself in the hospital. - He should leave me alone. Well, well, what a way to speak of your fiancé! Look at these gifts he's sent you. Open them soon. - Not tonight, mummy. I'm going to bed. Yes, off you go, girl. You cut a lamentable figure. Good night. Get a good rest. Good night! I've seen radiant fiancées. I swear to you they don't look like her. Madame rang? - Yes. You can start serving. - At once, madame. Come to dinner and stop grumbling. I'm as much concerned as you about my daughter's happiness. 9.15? This is inadmissible! Hello! Hello, nurse Natacha! Everyone sleep well? You think we can sleep well in here? Ignatoff asks the time every five minutes! Every night! At 6am, he calls a nurse and gets shaved. And then he waits. He waits for 9am. And you, captain? What's your complaint? My complaint is that it's 9.15. What about discipline, nurse Natacha? I am at fault, captain. - Stand at ease! Where? - In that chair! Very good, captain. Hello. - Hello. Captain Polonsky, time for your dressings. Ah, good. A hospital that has Brioukhoff's fiance as a nurse must not lack for money. I don't know how to thank you! Forget it, major. I simply have one small request. I'll be delighted to oblige. I've only just arrived, I haven't seen my fiancée. I'd like to give her a little surprise supper, tonight. Will you allow her to start a little later tomorrow? Naturally, kind sir. Would you like to visit the hospital? The hospital...? If you want to show me the room where nurse Natalie works, then I wouldn't say no! - Please, kind sir. Oh no, captain. Don't cut this sad figure. You're no longer sick, you're going to get better. You're going to recover! Well then? Well then, thank you. Because without you... - Oh... Oh yes. I owe all this to you. What, "all this"? - Well... Firstly, to be alive! And then, then, to find life beautiful again. Yes, this above all else, is thanks to you! Looks like your delirium is returning! A visit, nurse Natalie. Piotr Petrovitch! - Shush. Just for two minutes. A simple greeting. You had a good trip? - I came quickly to see you. Officer sir, I wish you a prompt recovery. Mr. Brioukhoff came to make a royal donation to the hospital. Let's say no more about that. You're too kind. Natacha, if there's anything I can do for you... Forgive me. I'll leave you, I'll see you this evening, there Wil be a surprise. The chief physician has agreed you can come in later tomorrow. Indeed. - Later tomorrow? Is this a military hospital or a nightclub?! Nurses arrive at 8am! Allow me to explain... - There's no point! Not too polite with the visitors! I didn't invite you! - Captain... Captain Ignatoff! Mr. Brioukhoff is my fiancé. What? There... You understand now? Yes. Yes, I understand. You'll forgive me, of course. Please excuse me, nurse Natalie. No offense, you weren't to know. Until tonight, Natacha. 10 o'clock, captain Ignatoff. Your medication. It's not me that needs curing, it's you! Forgive me, Natalie. I am a brute. Captain, I... Excuse me. Hey! What time is it? Leave me in peace, I'm not well! Natalia Alexandrovna. My little queen. To your happiness! To Natacha! # Who is the most beautiful woman in the world? # # Answer in unison, it's... # # ...Natacha! - NATACHA! # # Who is the woman with the sweetest face, with the most searching look? # # It's... # # ...Natacha! - NATACHA! # # Her laughter is clear, her cheek like a golden fruit. # # Everyone who sees her can only adore her. # # Who is the most beautiful woman in the world? Answer, # # in unison. It's Natacha! - NATACHA! # Thank you! Thank you. Thank you. Natacha! Hey... Ho? Natacha isn't happy? Why? Why the sad eyes? You need a drink! Natachenka! - Thank you. That's it! There, I'm happy when Natacha smiles. Eh? Still sad? What's up? What can I do? Don't pay it any heed. I'm a silly girl. Oh, your hands. Oh my God... What small hands! Mine are like paws. The paws of Brioukhoff! The paws of a bear! Hup! And the bear carries the little girl You must drink, sweetheart. You must drink. We both must drink. Drink to life. Here we go, chaps! Hey! Hello? Headquarters? This is General Stefanoff, commander of the 9th Army. Yes, bad news. 14 supply dumps destroyed by plane. Hello? The unused dumps weren't touched. What? Yes, intact. They attacked with definite knowledge. Unquestionably they had information. Here? Impossible. Who supplies us? Moscow, directly. The information must come from Moscow. From the general staff, yes. I'll send my report. Dispatch for the chief of counter-espionage. Secret. Thank you. Splendid! This is all we needed. HQ says that the enemy is kept informed of our supply dumps. Planes have destroyed them. Call Malev! Captain Malev? The colonel wants you. Colonel. Who, in the general staff, knows the allocation of dumps for the 9th Army? General Molochoff. - I know, but who else? The officer who knows every shipment is Lieutenant Petrovsky, the general's executive officer. The files are in his office. The secret locations are kept in his safe. Then, the matter is decided. Malev, tomorrow morning arrest Lieutenant Petrovsky. Good morning, Sidortchouk. - Good morning, Lieutenant Petrovsky. Nice day. Glorious. It's a shame to be locked up in an office in this weather! Urgent mail. Let's see. More claims on the quartermaster. Give me the file for deliveries from the armaments' factory in Tola. - Yes, lieutenant. The armaments' factory in Tola... Tola... Lieutenant! What's happened? The lieutenant has been killed. - Quick, a doctor! What's happened? Lieutenant Petrovsky is dead. - Petrovsky? How did this happen? - I was out looking for a file... Quick, doctor! It's over. Come in! What is it? I've come to arrest Lieutenant Petrovsky. Petrovsky... Here he is. It's done? It's done. He didn't talk? He didn't have the time. When they arrived to arrest him, he couldn't anymore. Any new orders? Nothing at the moment. As soon as Petrovsky's replacement is named, I'll advise. Here are your documents. - Thanks. Captain, my best wishes go with you. Look after yourself, follow my prescriptions closely. In six months, at the end of your leave, I think we'll be able to use your services. I intend to return to the front and not in 6 months. Goodbye, and thank you for your care. - Please. Well, Georges? Here, I have my documents, I can go. Everything's ready, captain. - Thanks. I'll call you. So, Vania, when's your turn? I don't know. 10, 15 days... They won't see me leading the charge again, I'm in no hurry. When I know what they're doing with me, I'll let you know. Have you said your goodbyes? - Yes. To everyone? To everyone, yes. Except... ...nurse Natalie. It's not easy, eh, my poor old thing? No. Not easy. Listen, Georges. - What? It's better you don't see Natacha. You'll only upset her. And yourself as well. It won't change anything, eh? So... I'll explain it to her. You're going to feel better. An injection in 15 minutes. And be very gentle. Captain Ignatoff isn't here? No. He just left. He's gone? Without saying goodbye to me? He didn't come find me? My dear poor Natacha... I thought it better this way. For him. And perhaps also for you. For me... Come on, captain, you have leave for six months. They are asses, Excellence. - Oh yes? Put down your cane. Take a few steps. Forgive me, Excellency. A ridiculous weakness. You're a youngster. I'm 32, Excellency! - 32, the Cross of St Georges. You're outraged to be on convalescent leave? Yes. - You're revolutionising the general staff, with your complaints about the medical commission. And then you barge in here, to the chief of staff, to complain about the general staff, about the medical commission and the whole world! Yes, Excellency. Well, this I find admirable! Yes, Excellency? Follow me. - As you command! The successor to Lieutenant Petrovsky is appointed. Who is it? Captain Ignatoff, 2nd regiment of artillery. Captain Ignatoff? Captain Ignatoff... Hello, captain. - Hello, lieutenant. Urgent mail. The general directs your attention to this letter. The 6th army are complaining that the flour arrives moldy. Whose are the next shipments? - Brioukhoff's. He supplies almost all provisions. - Brioukhoff? Brioukhoff... Contact the quartermaster. Tell him to send me an expert. - Very good, captain. Sidortchouk? - Captain? Bring me the file on Brioukhoff. The one dealing with the 6th army. - Yes, captain. Come in! I'm sorry to interrupt. Madame has an important statement to make. Yes, this is good. The window was open, I could see. See? See what, madame? Madame saw the death of Lieutenant Petrovsky. The death of... You want the witness statement collected? Yes, captain. Captain. Have a seat, madame. Is smoking permitted? - Of course. Thank you. Everything is so singular here, so totally military! It's a general staff, madame. Your name? - Anna Sabline. Domicile? - The hôtel National, opposite. I'm waiting for my apartment to be ready. Okay. I'm listening. - I live on the hôtel's second floor. We are neighbours. - Indeed. Well, the day... the famous day, my window was open. Yours too. Suddenly, I saw a man fire a revolver at another man, then he dropped his weapon. And then the room was full of people... - One moment, please. Then? That's all. I've been reflecting on it for a few days. I thought it might be of interest to you. Therefore I came. Have I done the right thing? You've rendered us a great service. What was the man like? The one who fired? Tall and thin, he seemed to me. But it all happened so quickly... Well, thank you, madame. I may need your testimony again. At your disposal. If you even want to collect my testimony at mine, we're neighbours, don't forget. I won't forget, madame. Ivan Ivanovitch! Everything must be done by noon. Get your men to pull their finger out. How many full wagons? - 57! And empty? - 68! Don't stand there like a pregnant woman! Ivan Ivanovitch! If it's all done by noon, the vodka's on Brioukhoff! I get you, Piotr Petrovitch. Officers are waiting for you! - Coming. The communication for the hospital, have you got it? Sokoloff is here. - Good. Captain Ignatoff. - Brioukhoff. Lieutenant Klimsky. - Brioukhoff. Sukotoff, from the quartermaster's. - We've met. You too, I've seen you somewhere before. In the hospital. Your fiancée looked after me. Yes, yes! By the way, you got the wrong impression of me. We can't always be bright and breezy. These things happen! What can I do for you? Natalia Alexandrovna is on the line. May I? - Go ahead. Hello? Hello? Yes, Natacha. Am I interrupting? It's to alert you that I've sent the carriage. The coachman will wait for you in front of the hospital. Yes. I'll be at the restaurant in a quarter of an hour. Of course, I'll be glad to see you. See you soon, Natachenka. Yes. Well then, gentlemen? We're here to check the flour you send to the front. Why the check? The merchandise has been accepted by the commission. Two acceptances are better than one. Bring us one of the sacks you're sending. If you like. A sack. Right away. - Pick one at random. I don't get what this is all about, but in the end... Put that there. Open it. What do you think, gentlemen? The flour is damp. It'll soon go moldy. - I haven't wetted it. They give it to me like this. - Be more stringent! Open about 20 sacks. And if the quality is sub-standard, you'll refuse the whole shipment! You want to oversee me like some child?! Because what you're doing is vile! Don't shout, I'm not one of your men. It's for them that I'm shouting! Okay, do as the captain says. Go tell Natalia Alexandrovna that I won't make our meal. I'll see her this evening. - Yes, Piotr Pietrovitch. Thank you, captain. - I salute you. I'm at your disposal, gentlemen. Nurse Natalie, they're asking for you downstairs. Thanks, I know. I'm coming. You? Here? I have to talk to you. It's you that was asking for me? Yes. Will you have lunch with me? I have an invitation. But otherwise, you would accept? I don't know. Excuse me. - Give me a minute. A quick stroll in the garden. If you like. Why did you leave without saying farewell? You wanted to see me? You've been looking for me? No. Ms. Natacha? Ms. Natacha? Please excuse me. Piotr Petrovitch sends you a thousand apologies. He won't be able to dine with you. He'll see you this evening. - Thank you. My respects, miss. Now, can you have lunch with me? Thank you, captain. No, I'll have lunch here. Natacha... You're determined to marry that man? Are you here for an interrogation? I wanted to know if you would truly be happy to be his wife. Natacha? Do you love Brioukhoff? Who?! What did you say?! Say it again, you son of a bitch! The captain who was just here... - You saw him with Natacha?! Yes, chief. You called, mummy? Yes. Sit down, I must talk to you. What's going on with your fiancé? You refuse to receive him. You make him wait days to exchange 3 sentences. I'm busy at the hospital. - Your husband comes first. You'll be married in 3 weeks. I don't understand you. That man worships you, he treats you like a queen. I haven't asked for anything. - Don't be silly. He's paid off all our debts. He's repaid the mortgage on the house. He's put it all in your name. This is how you thank him. - I'm going to my room. Wait. There's something else. What's this? - An officer I cared for. Where did you find these photos? In your room. Stashed away. - You have a nerve! Yes. These photos have no place with a fiancée. I forbid you... - What did you say? I'm glad I found you again. It was me that found you! Because you... - Don't. I've been fully occupied. Yes. And plus... Heartbreak... - Oh, heartbreak! So, to your heart! Three months I've been without a drink. - Yes? Ah! You know, it's only now that I can walk without a cane! Only now? - Yes. So then, to your health! I felt so good in the hospital. I would have stayed. But you wouldn't credit this... The commission arrived: 5 months of convalescence! You'll have a whale of a time - You think? I'm out of the frying pan into the fire. I'm in counter-espionnage. Funny how things turn out. - Counter-espionage? Well, let's drink to counter-espionage! You'll drink to almost anything, eh? More wine! I knocked them cold, a hand of 8 cards! I used up the whole deck. They play cards here? - It seems like it. Let's see this. Did you hear? An eight card hand! To you! 600 rubles to the bank. - Banco! 6. 7. 7. 1,200 rubles to the bank. 500. - 600. 1,100. There are 100 rubles left. 100 rubles! - Done. The cards. 9. - Good for the table. Bravo, Ignatoff! 1,500 rubles to the bank. - Banco! Deal. - 7. 3000 to the bank. 1000. - 800. 700. - 300. Another 200. - 200! It's done. 3000 to the bank. 9. 4. 4, 9. Good for the table. You're going to become a millionnaire! - It's my lucky day. Madame. Pardon. You forgot your flowers. - They aren't mine. Pity, because I like them. - These things will happen. You're not mine and I like you! Sir... Will you come to the restaurant? 6,800 rubles in banco. I give them. Banco. Card. 7. 4. Match me! The captain won't bet? Ah, lack of audacity! 9. 3. Good for the table. Leave it all. A banco of 13,600 rubles. Revenge, captain? No. Banco! You? 8! 9! Ah! You always were lucky. No, no, let it ride. A banco of 27,200 rubles. Captain? Thanks. I'm going back. Urgent business. Do you have any money? I've 300 rubles left. You want half? - No, thanks. Another 6000. - 2000. 4. - It's done. A fine! There are 54,400 rubles in banco! You give it, ...sir? I look like someone who's all played out? 54,400 rubles. Who says banco? Captain? This means nothing to you? Thank you. Usually, you are bold. Very bold. Here, it's more difficult, eh? Banco! 9. 3. The bank wins. Captain? I'll sign you... - Oh, sign... You're kidding me? An officer. Thank you, sir. - That's it. I have your word on your losings. I trust you. You have 72 hours. Good night. Captain Ignatoff? What? You, madame? Me. Excuse me. Aren't you ashamed? An officer of the general staff losing such a sum against an army supplier! And having to give your word, what's more. - Yes. Yes, I know. Cognac! They're watching you. Let's go somewhere else. Let's go. That was madness. What got into you? 72 hours to pay! Yes. 72 hours. And then... You are a child. A silly child. Yes, I know. You're good to me. And kind. But we hardly know each other! I remember your name. - So do I, Ms Sabline. Well I never! - One has a good memory at the moment of death. Here... Still 71 hours 18 minutes. And you don't know where to find the money? Ah, ah! 50,000 rubles! Unless I gain an inheritance from some unknown relative tomorrow... Stop drinking and listen to me. Only a complete fool would die for 50,000 rubles. You are not a fool. Oh, I am a fool! I was on 4 fronts. I fought for two years, I've lost count of the number of times I was wounded, I escape all that, and here, within 2 minutes, that brute has killed me! Come on, come on, you're not dead yet. Look, I know someone, ...not an honourable fellow, obviously. He will require you to pay the sum several times over in interest, but you'll gain some time. - Thank you. What's the point of gaining time? I'll never be able to pay it back, I only have my salary. And then you know, life... Natalia Alexandrovna. Welcome. Thank you, Piotr Petrovitch. - Natacha... Look at these fields. All these lands, all these forests, ...all this is yours. We'll call it "Natacha's estate". This is Brioukhoff's brainwave! Greetings, Fedor Ivanovitch! Greetings, Piotr Petrovitch! Fedor Ivanovitch, my best friend! Natalia Alexandrovna, my fiancée. The greatest beauty in all Russia! I no longer regret selling you my property, Piotr Petrovitch! You'll always be lucky. In business, in love and even in games! Yesterday you took a whole table to the cleaners! Myself, I lost 13,000 rubles. You never told me about this. - It was nothing. Nothing? Only 100,000 rubles, half won at the table, half owed by an officer, who couldn't pay! A rum business! There you weren't so lucky. - An officer? Yes, from the general staff, Ignatoff, I believe. Excuse me, I must rush. Here's the bill of sale. My congratulations, Natalia Alexandrovna. Now, all this is yours. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Bye! Piotr Petrovitch... You must send that officer a letter saying that you've been paid. Send such a letter to this officer... Why? Why? You would drive to despair a man returning from the front? He that was fighting while you were making money, ...and you would dishonour him? It's a crime! My little queen, don't be mad with Brioukhoff. I hadn't thought about all that. You tell me it's a crime, ...you're right about that. I'll send a receipt to this officer, and the affair will be over. I knew you were incapable of wrong-doing. This little officer... He won't have to worry about me anymore. 36 hours. Another 36 hours. The prettiest fiancée in Moscow! Natachenka, my darling! It needs a pleat, will you take care of this. - Yes, madame. In 4 days, the church! Will this take much longer? I'm tired. Not much longer. Make the train like this. Miss, an officer is asking for you. Natacha! - Natacha! Natacha! Captain! Natacha. I had to see you one last time. I tried to write to you, but it was too difficult. Natachenka! - Coming. Two minutes. - Your mother is impatient. Come to the palace ball tonight. - Me, come to the ball? But how can I? - Come. Why? - Come on! Natacha, come back this instant. I'm coming. Until tonight. Captain Ignatoff? Excellency? I've heard about your card game. I'm not going to lecture you. I'm giving you 24 hours to sort it out. As you command, Excellence. If you cannot pay, I hope that you will conduct yourself like an officer who respects his uniform. This is how I understand it. Of the 3 sorts with whom you were dancing, two, thanks to me, are our own men. The Deputy Governor of Moscow? - No, not quite. But the other two... Bravo. And what do your chaps do? One is a senior official on the railways. And the other? He's... director of the main prison. Uh huh. You think that might be useful? One never knows. You're right. One never knows! Ladies and gentlemen! A Neapolitan serenade in aid of the Red Cross: ...500 rubles! 5000! Mr. Brioukhoff, I believe? - The very same. Natacha, your fiancé is a man who's made his name. # A night of love # # from evening to daybreak # # offers us what everyone must grasp, pleasure. # # Forget tomorrow, we hold hands # # we exchange ardent # # promises. # # It's a ball where everything is clear, # # enchanted dreams # sparkling wine flowing from the necks of bottles. # # We're coming # # to dessert # # A night of love # # from evening until daybreak # # offers us what everyone must grasp, desire # # Let's join hands, forget tomorrow # # Our hearts promised # # forever. # I've come like you asked me to. I'll be married in a few days. I know. I have to tell you something. I owe you the truth. The first day I saw you, before you saw me, you were still delirious, I felt that... But it was already too late. Too late, I knew it. You understand me? Yes. But you're going to be married. You'll forget me. While I... Since I first saw you, nothing else existed. You became everything to me. But as you say, it's too late. So, I came to your house this morning to see you for the last time. The last time. Why do you say "the last time"? Because I don't have good fortune. Come. Come at once. - No. I'm instructing you to follow me. Sir... - Enough! I will not allow this... - Enough! I may be just a merchant, but I'm honest! I pay my debts! - What's this? Mr. Brioukhoff? What's this, Natacha? It's nothing. I am in the habit of settling my accounts. And I'll take care of yours! Uncle, let me introduce captain Ignatoff. Delighted, captain. See you tomorrow, captain. Yes? Until tomorrow. What just happened, my girl? Forgive me for removing you from your friends. I'm delighted to see you. - You could do me a great favour. - Nothing would please me more. You told me about a usurer. Um, I remember. I need money. On any conditions, and very quickly. - Come to mine tomorrow morning. He'll be there. - Before the office opens, is this possible? Yes, if it's urgent. - You are admirable. How can I thank you? - Don't look for a way. Sleep restfully. - Thank you. He's one of ours. Excuse me, colonel. It's nothing. I've just returned from the ball. Malev was there? - Yes, colonel. Hello, captain Malev? To the colonel's office. Any news? The operations continue. There have been searches. We're making progress. - Good. We've got them, colonel! We've discovered their drop-box. Where was it? - It was a beggar, a deaf-mute. We gave him a marked coin. A very nice cipher! It's not bad. Have you picked up the beggar? - Not yet. We're searching for where he is. We'll have him by tomorrow. Don't let him get away! You won't get any sleep, captain! I'll sleep tomorrow night. What's the time? 8.15. Oh, I must go. I'll be back this evening. Goodbye. - Goodbye, captain. Hôtel National! Pavlov? The postman for you. Hello! Mate, you don't have any luck. The captain's out again. This is the third time I've missed him. I can't keep registered mail more than three days. He'll have to collect it from the office. - This won't please him. It could be urgent... Give it to me. - It's against regulations. I've already signed in his name, for the parcels. Okay... take it. But you must promise me not to let on. Don't worry about that. There! Goodbye. - Goodbye. Come in. I'm sorry to disturb you so early, madame. I was waiting for you. I've put you out. - Oh no. This gentleman of whom you've spoken isn't here yet? He's not coming. He's not coming? Don't worry. We don't need him. - How's that, we don't need him? Listen, madame, you've been very good to me, but you haven't grasped the gravity of my situation. I grasp it very well. Sit down. Here's the money. You see? We don't need anyone. We can sort it out without any middleman. And above all, with no witnesses. What then? Is it a gift? You take me for... Don't be stupid, captain. I've found myself seductive enough not to need to offer money, even to a man I'm crazy about. It's a different matter. A very different matter. Have a cigarette. Listen to me. This is not a gift. I'm doing you a favour, you will do me one and we will be quits. - A favour? It's nothing much. Would you like a sweet? Thanks. I must have copies of the slips dealing with the movements of war goods. I said "copies", not the originals. Think about it. You will be saved. You will owe me nothing. And nobody will know, except you and me. Hello? Hello?! Captain, don't be a child! Get me the office... You are Anna Steinbach, called Anna Sabline? I am Anna Sabline. I arrest you. You? - Yes. What are you doing here? - I was about to alert you... I'm sorry. I have orders to arrest everyone I find here. Captain Ignatoff, I'm arresting you. Captain, give me your sword. I declare open the court martial trial of the military government. The Ignatoff case! Your first and last name? - Georges Alexandrovitch Ignatoff. Age? - 32. Rank? Captain in the 2nd Regiment of Artillery. 5 times wounded, seconded to the Moscow general staff. Cross of St George, of St Valdemar and of St Anne. Thank you. Captain Ignatoff, you are accused of treason. Do you plead guilty? No! Hrm... You can be seated. The floor belongs to the government commissioner. The accusation is based on 3 capital points. It has been proven that the spy Anna Steinbach, under the name Anna Sabline, had purchased the services of Lieutenant Petrovsky, murdered when he was about to be arrested. It is proven that the accused was in discussions with Anna Sabline about a developing relationship. Finally, during the interrogation, where Anna Steinbach and the accused was arrested, a sum of 60,000 rubles in banknotes was discovered on the table. It seems that after the death of Lieutenant Petrovsky, his successor, captain Ignatoff, contacted the spy Steinbach... Untrue! - Be quiet. I'm defending my life! - Wait. He cannot deny their relationship. - I saw her at the general staff. She came to give testimony. - Is that all? I'd met her again 2 or 3 time. She offered to get me a loan from a usurer to pay off a debt. You barely knew her? - Yes. This solicitude didn't seem abnormal to you? Yes. A little. You have accepted the principle of the loan. Anna Sabline was supposed to introduce me to a usurer. At 8am? General Molochoff had given me 24 hours. Right, you arrived at the Hôtel National. What happened? Anna Sabline told me that the man wasn't coming. She offered me the money and placed the notes on the table. She revealed to me what she expected in exchange. Information on the movements of troops?... Military equipment. - What did you do? I went to call counter-espionage... Yes, you held a telephone when you were arrested. Nothing proves that it was to counter-espionage. It could be a coincidence... I'm speaking the truth! Prove it. - I have only my word! Insufficient. - You insult me! I demand more than unsubstantiated assertions I've fought for you... Captain Ignatoff! I remind you to respect military magistrates! President sir, please excuse the defendant. He has not stopped claiming his innocence. There's no evidence. Excuse me! The 60,000 rubles! The money hadn't been touched by the captain. He was about to denounce the spy when the officers arrived. It's a coincidence, yes. But coincidences do exist. It will not suffice to deny them to convict a man. Anna Steinbach never acknowledged that the accused had sold her his services. I demand a confrontation. The court grants your demand. Bring in Anna Steinbach. As you command, Excellency. Did any relationship of an intimate character, you know what I mean, exist between you and the spy Anna Steinbach? Never. You affirm that you never said you'd supply her with information? I am a soldier. A military secret is more sacred to me than my life. Well, the Steinbach woman? - Escaped. What? When the court's car arrived to find her in the prison, she was no longer there. Accomplices of her's had been posing as the military. - You will give me a report. As you command, Excellence. Please continue. You also affirm that you received no money from the Steinbach woman. - Yes. Right. Do you have any personal wealth? No, I only have my salary. No other income? - None. How were you able to pay off your gambling debt? What? But I haven't paid it. You haven't paid the 54,000 rubles to Brioukhoff? No! - President sir? May we reveal the item found at the home of the accused? - Let's see. Captain Ignatoff, the day of your arrest, a registered letter was left at your home with your signature of acceptance. This letter contains a receipt signed by the merchant Brioukhoff, for the sum of 54,000 rubles. Commander? What do you have to say? I don't understand. I don't understand. - You don't understand? No, I don't understand! It's false! I never had that money! - This is inexplicable. I ask that Brioukhoff... give testimony. - Summon him here for tomorrow at 9am. As you command, Excellence. Court adjourned! # Who is the most beautiful woman in the world? # [etc] Where is she? - She's gone to the house. She said it was serious, I took her. Is she there? - Yes. Go get her Go on, out! Get out of my way! Come on, come on! Out! I'm drunk. I've been drinking. I drink all the time, because of you. I am... a poor messed-up creature. But no more, since you are here. Sit down. There. Drink some champagne. It's good, it's fresh. - No, thank you. Yes, you must drink... You've come... to see me... You've been summoned tomorrow to captain Ignatoff's trial. Your statement will decide his fate. You must tell me what you'll say. I want to know. This is why you've come? You old fool! I thought... It's for him. For your officer, your... Your captain Ignatoff! You can say goodbye to him. He's finished. Shoulder arms! Fire! They fire! No more captain. He's dead. He's dead! You understand?! I'm begging you. I'm begging you, have mercy. Listen to me. Save him, I'll do whatever you want! Give the order, I'll be your wife if you want. My wife? You'll be my wife? Who do you love? Who do you love? Him. He's dead! Get out! You can cry for him all night! He's dead! Come back! Come back! Music! Music! He's dead. He's dead! He's dead! Witness Brioukhoff! Take the oath. I swear before Almighty God. I swear before Almighty God. And on the Holy Cross. And on the Holy Cross. To tell the whole truth. To tell the whole truth. And nothing but the truth on the Ignatoff case. And nothing but the truth on the Ignatoff case. Not allowing myself to be influenced by any kinship Not allowing myself to be influenced by an kinship Nor any friendship. - Nor any friendship. In witness thereof, I kiss the Holy Crucifix. In witness thereof, I kiss the Holy Crucifix. Don't forget that you are testifying before a court martial. Your words may have serious consequences. - I kissed the Holy Cross. On 14th June, you found yourself at the merchants' club. You won 54,000 rubles from captain Ignatoff. Is this correct? - 54,000 rubles, exactly. Is this receipt in your handwriting? Yes, president sir. You wrote, signed and sent this receipt to captain Ignatoff? Yes. The case is made. There remains one question to ask. The response will determine the fate of the defendant. The witness actually received the 54,000 rubles? Received it? Yes, Brioukhoff! You've signed a receipt. But were you paid? Your honours, this man has taken everything from me! All that I hold dearest in this world! More than money or life! I hate him! I curse you! You hear? - I know! And I have no hope! Silence. Brioukhoff, did you receive that money? Well, did you receive that money?! I swore... I swore on the Holy Cross. I did not receive the money. So, why did you send the receipt? I was asked to. So that I did not commit an evil deed. There were moments where I thought all was lost. It's over. Over. You remember, at the hospital? After your delirium? Your waking? Yes, I remember. Close your eyes. All this that happened doesn't matter anymore. It was a nightmare. Now, open your eyes. Life begins! The two of us together.
