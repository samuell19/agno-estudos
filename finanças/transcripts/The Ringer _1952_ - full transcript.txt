"It was in Cairo that I first met Arthur Milton." "I only knew him a couple of days and we got married." "It was all a bit of a rush. You see, the police were after Arthur." "So we spent our honeymoon on the run." "Paris, Cape Town, Singapore, Hong Kong." "But it really wasn't much fun." "It seemed the police wanted Arthur everywhere." "We hid quite successfully in Australia for a while." "Almost got to know the neighbours." "Until one night Arthur committed suicide." "At least that's what the police thought until they found out he was in London." "My dear husband had quite calmly walked out on me." "He thought he could do a certain job in London better on his own." "Of all the stupid things to do." "In London, Arthur was wanted more than anywhere." "The police picked up petty crooks coming out of prison .." "Who might be able to help them find The Ringer." "For that is what they called Arthur." "The Ringer. I never quite knew why." "Anyway, the police thought this fellow Hackett here might know something." "They soon whistled him up to Scotland Yard." Mr Hackett, sir. - Alright. We won't keep you a moment. No. The Assistant Commissioner isn't here yet. This is Mr Hackett who .. - Listen .. Five or six years ago I got him 18 months at London sessions. A born liar. What does Hackett know about the Ringer? - Well, he says he'd recognise him. He'd say anything to create a sensation. What if Hackett doesn't know The Ringer, who else is going to identify him? You for one. That's why you are on the case. Me? Never set eyes on him. He had his back turned to me the day I tried to arrest him. The Ringer is clever. I hand it to him. - You don't seem very happy, Bliss. I wish to god I was back in Washington. I had a soft job there. Checking scientists for the FBI, eh? Now you're back to the dull routine. Too bad. If you'd been in America Wembury they would have kept you there. They wanted me back at The Yard. I like your manners. I hate your modesty. Come in, Sam. - Hello, Mr Wembury. You are looking bright and healthy. How is the family? There isn't any family, Sam. Policemen get about too, eh? Good morning, sir. You remember Mr Bliss? Bliss? Bliss. Yeah. You've changed a bit, haven't you. Where did you get all the moss from? But I wouldn't have recognised you. Straight up, I wouldn't recognise him. This is the man, sir. Morning, Mr Hackett. - Morning, sir. A nice little pitch you have got round here. All made out of thieving and murder. We had a letter from you when you were in prison. Where is it? Here it is, sir. Ah yes. Thank you. "Dear sir, this comes hoping to find you well." "An old, kind friend at Scotland Yard." Yes. But I didn't know Bliss was back. "There's a lot of talk about The Ringer here. He that was drowned in Australia." "Dear sir, I can tell you a lot about him now that he has departed this life." "RIP." "As I once saw him though only for a second and I knew where he lodged." Is that true? - Yes. We lodged in the same house. You know what he looks like? Well sir, what he did look like. I don't reckon I'd know now with his wings. Wings? - Yes, sir. Unfortunately, The Ringer is alive. The Ringer alive? Very much alive. Well, I'll say thanks very much. Good morning, all. - Just a minute, Hackett. What do you know about him? - Nothing, sir. Straight up and without any madam. - Any what? "Madam". Without telling a tale, sir. In this letter you expressed your willingness to act as an informer. Maybe sir, on a dead man. But not on a live Ringer. Not much. Not me. If you can help us we may be able to help you one day. Not if I was dead you couldn't. You or anybody else, and that's what I'd be if I went nosing on The Ringer. He is yellow like the rest of his kind. Always the same story when their own skins are in danger. Here. You have been closer to him than I have. He nearly done you once. What's keeping you back? Come on, Hackett. Tell us what you know. What are you afraid of? Well, the same as he is, sir. No. I am sorry. I've been brought up here on what is termed a misapprehension. I'll say good morning. Don't trouble. Won't be long before we see you again. Yes. It's the thing that would keep me straight, Bliss. The thought |I'd see you again. - Alright. That's enough. Who is this man The Ringer is supposed to be after? Meister. Maurice Meister. You better inform Meister The Ringer is back. Right sir. - What? The Ringer back? And Meister doesn't know it? That is half a laugh, isn't it, eh? Hey, you. What's up boy? Mr Meister in? A friend of his? We went to different schools together. - Well, he is busy. He won't be too busy to see me when he hears what I have to tell him. My dear Mr Bell. How can I give you advice as a lawyer on a matter which is outside the law? Please be logical. Is there anything ..? Hello, Hackett. How do, Guv. Can I have a word? Sit down, I shan't be a moment. Anything else you want to talk about? - No That's everything. No trouble with this job. You'll see how well organised we are. Please don't tell me anything about it. It's no concern of mine. Pretty concerned with the results though, aren't you. My dear fellow, I give you the benefit of my intelligence and that is all. Alright, Santa Claus. Have it your own way. I didn't know you were out. - Yes, I'm out. When are you going in? People like Mr Bell don't, do they. - Any jobs going? Not in your class, chum. - I see. Snob stuff, eh? Not got the right accent. By the way, there is one thing. There is a night watchman. In case of accidents we are counting on you. You will find it difficult to remove the absurd prejudice of a jury .. Against a defendant who killed an elderly night watchman. There is nothing amateur about the work of our organisation, Meister. Who should know that better than you? - Goodbye, Mr Bell. When did they turn you loose, Hackett? - Today. I came straight here. - Nice of you. Why? I've got a bit of information for you worth a couple of fivers at least. Don't tell me you've knocked off the chief warder's wife? No. I had a good butchers. Not worth pinching. But I tell you I've got something, a bit of information that will paralyse you. Yes, Lisa? There are two gentlemen to see you. - Who are they? They say they are from the police. Well show them in, my dear. I tell you what, Guv. I'll let you have that bit of info for a fiver. Not interested in your nonsense, Hackett. A couple of quid then. You will be sorry. Blimey, don't you bogeys move fast when there ain't no hurry. Good morning. - Morning. Would you take Mr Hackett next door my dear, while I speak to these gentlemen. Bearers of bad news used to have their heads cut off, Hackett. You are lucky. Lucky? I haven't had a chance to tell him anything yet. I can't give you much time. It's now ten past eleven. I have to defend at Greenwich Police Court. Things might go badly with my poor client if I am not there. The course of justice might go more smoothly. That's a matter of opinion. Would you care for a drink, gentlemen? Thank you, no. Have we met before? - I am sorry. Chief Inspector Bliss - Mr Meister. Mr Meister is a very successful lawyer with a large practice in Deptford. A funny district to choose. He is a kind of a squire. Mr Meister of Flanders Lane, and behaves like one. How so? He looks after his people, defends them if they're in trouble. And if they go to prison Mr Meister supports the relatives. Do I have to be suspect because I help these unfortunate people? Suspect, my dear Meister? Who would mention the word? As far as the police are concerned .. Mr Meister's actions are motivated purely by kindness. I have always had a very high regard for the intelligence of the police but .. Take a bow, Bliss. Gentlemen, what can I do for you? Excuse me. Why have you called? - We were just coming to that. There was a girl whom you took into your employment. Her name was Brenda Milton. The sister of The Ringer. She was found drowned. That is a tragedy I don't care to be reminded of. Neither should I if I were in your shoes. What does that mean? I shouldn't care to have The Ringer as an enemy. The Ringer died in Australia. - What makes you think that? Common knowledge, my dear chap. It was reported in the press months ago. Perhaps it hasn't reached the ears of the police. He left his sister in your care. Why did she end her life? My dear fellow, why do women end their lives? I don't know. There is one reason as old as the hills and you know it. Melodrama, Wembury. He had arranged for her to go into a nursing home. It didn't come out at the inquest. Nobody knew about it but Scotland Yard and Henry Arthur Milton. Scotland Yard couldn't do anything about it. And mister .. Milton .. is dead. I'm afraid we must disillusion you about that. Mr Milton is here. Has it come over the grapevine that The Ringer is back? It hasn't. And not a bird moves in Deptford but I know it. Somebody is fooling you, Inspector. The Ringer is here and he's alive. Get that into your head. We come here to warn you. Warn me? But why? Look. Get out will you. Do it later. Warn me? Why? Don't strike attitudes. You are not in the police court. We think he may have an idea he has an account to settle. With me? - Who else? His sister was my secretary and that was all. We'll, you'd better explain that pretty quickly to him when you meet him. My dear fellow, why should I meet him? I've never seen him my life. I don't know the man. If he is back here with a life sentence hanging over him why don't you get him? It is so easy to get The Ringer. Well, get his wife, Cora Ann. Wherever she is, he is. He is crazy about her. I mean, he was. You mean you're serious about all this? - Yes. She is the crazy one and she followed him to Australia. Well whoever follows who .. One is never very far from the other. Get her and you get him. We are not worried about her. You are our immediate worry. Yes. And Meister, you had better warn some of your clients we are around. The last person they want to see is a police officer. And don't admit anybody after dark. Never go out without a police escort. Have some shutters put on those windows. Shutters, Guv? No good now you know. Well, what do you advise? Nothing short of steel bars. And another thing, see that the rivets are on the inside. Straight up. The day you take him I will give a thousand pounds to the police orphanage. We don't need money so badly as that. Well give it to the Prisoner's Aid Association, Guv. I'll have a look round here for a bit, Wembury. Cover the garden and grounds. No objection I take it, Mr Meister? It must flatter you to have the police look after your interests. I am tickled pink, my dear fellow. Now Hackett here is supposed to know The Ringer. It might not be a bad idea to keep him on the premises. He could tip you off. What, me sit in the bullseye? And the ringer a dead shot. What do you mean, tip me off? But surely it is the responsibility of the police. The Ringer is a murderer. We can't prove it. - But you know it. Knowledge is not proof. No-one should know that better than you, Meister. The Ringer got rid of a few people the police were glad to be rid of. Yes. You're dead right there. They was. - So the police shut their eyes? You are an offensive character, Meister. Police never shut their eyes. Take my advice. Keep this fellow Hackett around. Do you want an honest job, Sam? - No, sir. No qualifications. Come on, take it. It's easy money for a change. Mr Meister would pay you well. Wouldn't you, Meister? This is all a very silly game, I must say. Maybe, but I'd take my advice if I were you. Still, if the police insist. If he makes himself useful around here I can pay him a few pounds and his keep. What, me live here? The house not comfortable enough for you, Mr Hackett? Ah no. Too unhealthy. Come on, Sam. What do you say? - Look here, Guvnor. The Ringer might bump him off before I get my pay-packet, see? Here, I tell you what I'll do though. Make it a daily rate and I'll chance it. Look, Hackett, I'm a busy man. Sam, the first thing you do is make this house burglar-proof. Yes. But you know that is impossible, Mr Wembury. Anyway, I'll do my best. Good, get a move on. Get everything done by tonight if you can. Good morning, Mr Meister. Sam. Bye, sir. Now don't worry, Guv. I don't want to see The Ringer any more than you do. The police. They asked for me and my papers. Hmm? Yes dear, but .. Don't worry. I dealt with them. But you told them I wait for Johnny. That wouldn't have been wise. - Why not? Why not? My dear Lisa. Because Johnny is serving his sentence. Whatever he is your eyes, in theirs he is a criminal. It wouldn't commend you to the police if I said you were waiting to marry Johnny. Oh well. Johnny was foolish. That's all. You don't get a 4-year sentence just for foolishness. He wanted money quickly to marry me. I know, I know. And those crooks promised him money. Well, if you associate yourself with crooks you have to be clever. And Johnny wasn't clever. He gets himself caught. He leaves his girl at the mercy of the world. What sort of a man is that to pin your faith to? Faithfulness my dear, can be carried too far. It becomes ridiculous. What did you tell the police? Do they ..? Do they want to send me out of England? No. No, they won't. Not as long as you are here under my wing, as it were. The police have a high regard for me you know. Yes, but .. but do they know I am not a criminal? You could explain to them how it happened. That I came in with Johnny on a visitor's permit. And we were going to get married. But I have done nothing wrong to stay in this country and wait for him. Nothing wrong? Remaining in a country after the expiration of your visa? Oh, my dear child. But I have seen to that. I give you protection here. I give you sanctuary. What is that? - Sanctuary? A roof over your head. Food. Clothes. And I hope, a little friendship. But of course. And I'm very grateful to you for letting me work here. You are very good at it too, my dear. I wish you weren't as good at .. waiting for Johnny. It's as if your only role in life was to wait for Johnny. I am afraid it is. The role many women like, huh? It gives them immunity. Untouchability. It is also full of tricks. I have no tricks. That would be very boring, Lisa dear. Are you sure you wouldn't rather I took a job somewhere else? But you couldn't get a job anywhere else, Lisa. You have no papers. But why argue. You like it here don't you? You can hardly call me a slave driver. No, no. You are kind. - Then what are we arguing about? Look. Run along now. Finish your work. I am busy this afternoon but I will see you at dinner. Oh, Lisa. Smile. I said smile. Smile a little. Mr Meister. I'm just going outside to have a look round, Guv. Here. I've got a job of work for you. I want bars .. bars everywhere. Right? And I don't mean the kind of bars where you get the old half-pint, see. I want flipping great bars on all them windows. Here. Who are you? The Ministry of Defence. Strictly pro-tem. See? Four men to guard a crook's house. And The Metropolitan Police two thousand under strength, sir. Never enquire into the mysteries of Scotland Yard, Carter. Morning, Miss. - Morning. My name is Cora Ann Milton. I am an American citizen. This is my passport. Attend to that right now, Carter. I've come to register my change of address. I am moving down to this district. - Right, Mrs. I wish I didn't know so much about criminology. I find other books on this subject remarkably unenlightening. Consequently, I never read them. But then that makes me wonder whether anybody will ever read mine. Wembury, will you have a wee nip? Carter. Never become too erudite, Wembury. Never become an expert. Life becomes too dull. Do you know the older I get the more I become convinced that .. Cross-examination remains the only art left the criminologist. Will I ever convince you of that? - No. Carter. Do you know anything about this report from "B" Division? "B" Division, sir? Keep that woman here. Find out something wrong with her papers. And send her in to me in a few minutes. - Right, sir. Who is she? - Cora Ann Milton. Cora Ann. Cora Ann. Ha. A pretty name. A pretty woman too. Wife of The Ringer. - The Ringer? A very dangerous customer. Yes, but why do you call him The Ringer? - He rings the changes. And his personal appearance. But then don't they all? I'd like this one. He is unique. In Deptford they say he can change the colour of his eyes. So they turned him into a legend, eh? What does he look like? Descriptions? Several descriptions. All poles apart. No photographs. We've got this drawing here made by a steward on a boat. That's all. And why this sudden interest in The Ringer? He is supposed to have died in Australia but The Yard weren't convinced. You see, people like The Ringer don't just die in Australia. The Yard had a report that he was here. We weren't convinced of that either. At least I wasn't. Not until now. What complex process of deduction .. Led you from the presence of Cora Ann Milton here .. To the suspicion that her husband is alive? That is just what I hope to find out in a minute. Wembury, why don't you let me try my hand on it? Heaven forbid. The powers of cross-examination scientifically applied .. Should never be underrated. What is it? - Excuse me, sir. There seems to be some errors in this permit. Alright. Ask Mrs Milton to come in. I was coming in, in any case. Where my passport goes, I go. It's one thing I don't like out of my sight. Quite right. Won't you sit down? This is Dr Lomond. He is quite harmless. Hmm. That's too bad. - How do you do? This isn't your first visit to London, is it Mrs Milton? No. It is all in the book there. - Ah yes. I see. Now, did you arrive alone? Except for a planeload of other people, yes. I mean essentially alone. You were not accompanied by your husband? No, sir. Nor my mother or any of my aunts. That was very careless of your husband. You allow that kind of remark? Dr Lomond is our police surgeon. They're not strictly on the force but we allow them some latitude, of course. But not too much. - Now, isn't that nice. And I am just dying to talk to somebody. What's the best show in London anyway? The best show in London Mrs Milton is Scotland |Yard. Melodrama without music. And you are the leading lady. Oh? What am I leading? Me, for the moment. Really? You know doctor that I haven't seen my husband in years? That I am not likely to see him again. I thought everybody read that in the newspapers. Poor Arthur drowned in Sidney Harbour. You didn't know, Inspector? - Should I know? There's nothing wrong with my passport. You just had to talk to me. Your husband left this country two years ago, or was it three? Three. When did you see him last? Two or was it three? Let's be accurate, my dear girl. You saw him in Australia? You arrived in Sidney about three months after he reached there. While you were there you were .. Well, shall we say, in communication with him? You seem to have it all there so why bother to ask me? I never saw him and that is the truth. - You never saw him? He was afraid that somebody might be trailing you? Afraid that you might lead the police to him. Afraid? You don't know what you're talking about. He wasn't afraid of anything or anyone. And now you say he is dead, huh? Come in. Henry Arthur Milton. Who recently left Australia. With another woman. Come in, please. He is not there. That's a dirty trick. I'm sorry, but I don't like the way he kids me along. Don't let him worry you. He has an unfortunate manner. I don't know anything and you have nothing on me. I certainly don't have to answer any of your fool questions. It is Mrs Milton, isn't it? What does that mean? I just thought it might be one of those happy natural liaisons. It was happy, it was natural and it was legal. Well, well. And you can get that bug out of your head about another woman. There was no other woman ever in Arthur Milton life. I would walk down Collins Street. With the police tailing me. Because he had rung me and asked me to. All because he wanted just to look at me. He risked everything to see me. I wouldn't recognise him but he would be there. Is that the kind of man who .. Goes off with some other woman? - No, no. No. But he sounds to me very much like a man who is alive and here in England. If he is, why don't you catch him? May I have my passport please? - I'm sorry you have been detained. Your papers are quite in order. You met him and you didn't recognise him? Love is blind. Do you think you would know him if you saw him? You want us to believe he was so well disguised .. That he could walk down Collins Street in broad daylight and not be recognised? I am sorry Cora, but it won't do. On Collins Street. He'd walk on Regent Street. If he felt that way, he'd come right to Scotland Yard. You laugh. Go on, laugh. He would do it. He would do what, Mrs Milton? I am sorry. What is it? Sorry, but I am rather nervous today. Anything makes me jump. Well, I guess that lets me out. You just try to get me back again. What's the matter, Mrs Milton? What are you frightened of? You're in a police station. Well, I tell you it was that drawing. I just caught a glimpse of it and .. It gave me a shock. You see, I rather liked Arthur. And don't be so darned sure there is nothing to fear in a police station. I say, you men. See that you get them rivets on the inside. And you, keep your dirty hands off the walls. You ordered brandy, sir? Put it there. - Here? There. How do you like my posh accent? All got up to match the tray. Have you called Miss Lisa? It's a nice bit of stuff too. Do you mean Miss Lisa or the brandy? No, the tray. I am under police protection, Hackett. That includes my property. Yeah. You know. Taking it all in all, Guv. It is a bit of a flipping laugh isn't it, eh? I feel like something out of Madam Tussaud's. I'm not cut out to be a gent's gentleman. Too flipping familiar. That's what you are. Draw the curtains, will you. Here. You've got them things far too far apart. I know plenty of gentlemen with rubber guts that can squeeze through that gap. Who is giving orders? - Me, that's who. That's why I am here. An expert, eh? Dead right, mate. On both sides of the fence. You watch me and keep your eyes and ears open and you will be alright. Hackett, please. Sorry, Guv. It's all this blooming clobber. The blokes won't take notice of me in this fancy dress. Tell them to get on with it and attend to things indoors. And fetch Miss Lisa's coffee. - Okay. It's on the hob. I like it very black. - Oh, it's as black as silk, Miss. Smells like it too. Afraid I'm not very good at this coffee-making lark though. Now if it was char .. - That's enough, Hackett. That moron gets on my nerves. - He makes me laugh. He's no good in the house and he talks too much. I can hardly understand what he says. A dialect? Cockney, dear. - Cockney? Yes. A gay little language all of its own. Only slightly connected with the King's English. Have you typed those things I gave you? Oh yes. - Good. A clever girl. I don't know what I should do without you. There are plenty of people who can type. They don't look like you. Or smile like you. Or walk like you. Why does it embarrass you? It cuts across your favourite act doesn't it. What act\|? Waiting for Johnny. It is not an act. No. Of course not, my dear. I was joking. I am sorry. No girl could have kept it up for so long if it were. No sensitive intelligent girl like you I mean. This house is going to look like a prison. I am sorry about all this, Lisa. Thank you. - Black enough, Miss? Oh yes. Hackett, I'll not stand for much more of this. Haven't they finished yet? They are just putting the alarms in. - Alarms? Yes. Burglary alarms. I hope you never hear none of them Miss, if you're on the wrong side of the door. Blimey, the scares I've had. After that, I'd say a trumpet sounded like a penny whistle. I didn't hire you as a raconteur, Hackett. Get me two more brandies, will you. If you haven't drunk it all. - What, me drink brandy? With all that bubbly lying about? Hark at him. You must be the best audience he's ever had. He knows it too. - I think he is very funny. Well, he is all yours, dear. Drink your coffee before it gets cold. Now what goes on? Are you going to make much more noise? I've got to connect up the alarm bell with that switch. Oh. Am I in your way? No, Miss. You are alright. Stay where you are. Do you understand those things? - I should do. Should do? Why isn't the electrician here himself? - The place is lousy with silver trays. Hackett, we don't want a running commentary on your duties. There you are, sir. Stiff ones. Lisa? - No thanks. Not for me. Come, take it. Good for the nerves. - No thanks. Take it. Let's have some light shall we. [ Burglar alarm bell. Loud! ] What have you done, you fools? Give us Scotland Yard. Hello, hello? Stop those bells, will you. Hello? Hello, hello. Hello. Ninety-nine. Well, there you are, Mr Meister. You will have a sore hand for a day or maybe two. But it could have been worse. And now I think we can all do with a drink. Hackett, a drink. Hackett. In future, if the alarm bells fuse send for electricians, not the police. How was I to know it wasn't The Ringer? By the simple process of looking, halfwit. You know Mr Wembury, one of these days I'll do him. Honest I will. I'll do him. - Sam, behave yourself. Here, Guv. That's a nice bit of stuff, eh. It Would sell well, wouldn't it? I wonder what I would get for it. - About three years. Is he alright, doctor? Sure. Aye, he is alright. What are you, the factotum? No, sir. English. What's your name? Samuel Cuthbert Hackett. That's a terrible name. Would you like to earn an honest five pounds? I pay on results. I am from Aberdeen. Can you tell me something about The Ringer? Something that I don't know already. Well, do you mind if I give you a bit of advice for nothing? Don't go nosing in on The Ringer. That's if you value your skin. They tell me that you are a friend of his. Well, I am not saying yes and I am not saying no. But I will tell you this much. He wouldn't half get a laugh if he could see all this how-do-you-do. Them bars. Blimey, they wouldn't keep me out, let alone The Ringer. Perhaps you are The Ringer? Please don't make jokes like that, sir. Please. It turned my stomach right over. Wembury, they are awful dangerous contraptions, these burglar alarms. By the way, I was fascinated by your friend Cora Ann. Yes, so I noticed. I would put that thing down if I were you. Would you say I had a good approach? - To women? On the elephantine side, I'd say. Oh, don't depress me, Wembury. I thought I had made an impression. Hardly the right one. You were trying too hard. Are you likely to see her again? Not while you are around. - Competition, eh? Not where The Ringer's wife's concerned, old boy. That would be curtains. Doesn't the risk appeal to you? The element of challenge, eh? What's happening to men nowadays. Look Dr Casanova, lay off The Ringer's wife. She is a very beautiful girl. Yes. You might look beautiful too laying on a marble slab, though I doubt it. Would you send me lilies? Good evening. - Yes? He wants to see Mr Meister. Is he in? Mr Meister is busy. - I won't keep him long. I tell you he is busy. He won't see anyone. I must see him. Well, give me a message. Him or you? Alright, constable. I will deal with this. Well? - My boy is in trouble, see. Been on a job and comes up before the beak tomorrow and .. I promised I'd get Meister there to defend him. Oh. You wait here. Samuel. Samuel Cuthbert Hackett. That's a terrible name. Have you seen this contraption? Ah, it is natty, isn't it. - It is very empty. I get you. Refill? - Aye. Come into the dispensary. Oh, is that where the fuse boxes are? They are awfully elaborate. I used to potter with electricity when I was a wee lad. Well? He says phone him tomorrow. Look, I don't want any nonsense. And nor do we. - He can't get away with this. He has to see me. It's his duty. - Now, now. What's the trouble? Who are you? No-one comes in here without me knowing it. He wants to see Meister but Meister won't see him. That's it isn't, mate. Phone him tomorrow. He'll talk to you then. You've got too many police around here. Do you know what I would do? - You might be wasting your time, pal. Someone has exactly the same idea. Don't you worry. I will be back. Excuse me, if you please. - Just a moment, madam. Now look here. My old man is in there. They just told me down at the station. So don't you try and gammon me. - Got any hidden weapons on you, eh? If I do they're my own private property. - What's your business anyway? I told you. I want to see Mr Hackett and it's very urgent. Hackett? What's he up to in there? How should I know? That's what I am here to find out. Sam Hackett. So here you are. Now, Bella. - I found you at last, you snake. Enjoying yourself while me and the kids can starve. Put a sock in it. You'll get me fired. You call yourself a man, hiding behind that dickey? Why don't you come home like you always does? Don't shout. I am not deaf. Give us a chance. We can wait, we can. While you strut around done up like a dog's dinner. You are acting above yourself, that's what you ware, Sam Hackett. Well, what do you think I am doing it for? You and the kids. You haven't gone straight, have you? - Don't talk daft. I'm making contacts, see. It might raise us up into the mahogany class. What about raising some housekeeping money? Because now you're out I'm giving up my job at Woolworths. Alright. Alright. As soon as I touch. - I know you, Sam Hackett. As soon as you touch you're a big noise in the pub until it's all blown. Hackett. Can't you conduct domestic arguments somewhere else? The kitchen perhaps? And who asked you to push your big ugly mug in? That's right, get me another six months. He's the chief dick from Flanders Lane. Oh! I am sorry, sir. But it's his fault you know. He is a lazy-good-for-nothing. Why put up with him? Why don't you leave him? Leave him? How can I leave him? I'm not married to him. Go on, hop it. Come home, Sam. Alright. As soon as the Guvnor is bumped off. Well, how long is that going to be? - Any moment now. But Sam .. Don't worry Bella. I'll be home soon. Look after yourself, darling. - Don't forget what I told you. Alright. Alright, Hackett. Did you ever know this man? Yes. - Alright, sir. I didn't expect to see you here, Johnny. What's up? What's all the fuss about? What are you all dressed up for? - I got a big bit of news for you. You'll die when I tell you. - You mean The Ringer being back? Where is Lisa? Here. How did you know? When did you get out? Gorblimey, you look well. Dartmoor must be a blooming holiday. Johnny. Johnny! Johnny. Johnny. But Jerry said .. I must be all mixed up. Listen. You're out too soon. - But I'm out. I'm free. Darling. Daring, you haven't escaped? I helped a warder when some damn fool attacked him. They remitted my sentence. Oh Johnny, helping a screw. Darling. Promise me one thing. Don't make any more trouble. No more trouble ever. No more police. Do you swear it? I swear it. Why didn't you write? - Didn't know myself until this morning. Well, well. Look who is here. Hello, Meister. Hello, Johnny. Let's have a look at you. How did you manage it? He saved a warder's life. One of your ex-clients attacked him, Meister. We must drink to our little hero. Shall we, Lisa? The boy who makes good. What will you have, Johnny? Not for me, Meister. - Lisa? No thank you. - Lisa and I are going to be married. I know, I know. Congratulations. I'm taking her to my people in Liverpool tonight. Tonight? I am sorry Johnny, but .. You forget she is my secretary. One can't let the secretary go at a moment's notice. She knows more about my affairs that I do. I'd be completely lost without her. Of course, in a few days I can make arrangements. That's too bad, but we are .. Taking the first train. I want her out of here. But why? She has been happy here. Haven't you, Lisa? Oh, yes. Yes, I like my work. He asked you Lisa, whether you had been happy. Yes darling, but .. I think it is reasonable that we should wait for a few days. Until I clear up my work. A few days? You talk as if days were nothing. I've been waiting two years. Now don't be hysterical, Johnny. I am trying to help you. Keep your advice for people who pay for it. My dear boy, you are hysterical. You'll have to try and adapt yourself to civilised life again. You should talk about civilised life. How about Gwenda Milton? I wonder why she committed suicide. Shut your filthy mouth. Who came out of the whole thing as innocent as a lamb? You can fool the law Meister because you know every move of the game. But there's someone around you that you can't fool. Who's just waiting for an opportunity to take the law into his own hands. And good luck to him. - Johnny. Why are you so frightened to speak the truth around here? He comes out of prison and he talks about truth. It's alright Johnny. I have .. I quite understand. Hello, doctor. Are you sure I am not butting in? No, no. Not at all. - I was just away. Excuse me, I'll egret my bag. This is a friend of mine, Mr Lemley. I have just been having a wee big chat with our friend there in the pantry. Lemley? Hmm. You are just back from the country, aren't you? I'm just out of prison if that's what you mean. Uhuh. Guv. Yes, what is it? There is a party outside wants to see you. Who is it? They asked me not to divulge the name This party said: Just say: "I am from The Ringer". A party from The Ringer? Show him in. Doctor, are you mad? - I know what I am doing. Show him in. Hello, Meister. Remember me? I am very sorry but just for the moment I am rather at a loss. Think hard. I will give you a clue. You knew my husband. That is a terrible opening to a conversation: "You knew my husband". Would you mind keeping out of this. My name is Cora Ann Milton. Yes, of course. My dear Mrs Milton, how do you do. Prettier than ever. - Oh, shut up. And how is your husband? Oh, he is fine. Just fine. You'll be pleased to hear that. Yes, indeed. I .. I brought you a message from him. - Oh? Can we talk alone somewhere? If you wish. This way. You will excuse us, won't you, Doctor? - Certainly. What is Mrs Milton doing here? Blimey, where have you two been, making the beds? Isn't that like a couple of coppers, eh? Never on the spot when you're wanted. Now listen. There isn't much time. Why don't you go away, out of the county? Arthur Milton is here in London for one purpose only. To get you, Meister. It is a mania with him. Whatever happened between you and his sister, he pinned her death on you. It's been burning up his mind for two years. He has one idea left and that is to get you. So he is in London? You have been listening to the police, Mrs Milton. I told the police. Trying to lead me to The Ringer? Very ingenious, I must say. I leave London where he'd never show himself and go, say, to the Argentine. And he would be waiting for me there, tipped off by you. What do you take me for, Mrs Milton? - You can cut that out. I wouldn't lift a finger to save you from hell. Get that into your head, Meister. Run fast while you still have breath to do it with. And run to The Ringer? - From The Ringer, you fool. It's here in this house you will meet him and not anywhere else. You are looking very beautiful today, Cora Ann. That's more than I can say for you, doctor. The merry widow, eh? You can cut out the widow stuff. It is too near home. The merry grass widow then? - Not so merry as all that. Still hankering after that husband of yours? Isn't it time you stopped worrying? You are dead right it is, doctor. You can't still be in love with him? Love? I don't know. What is love anyhow? I've forgotten. - Love? Well .. They say in the books it is where the heart is. Mine is in my mouth most of the time. - That is anatomically impossible. It was love that took you all the way to Australia after him wasn't it? Was it? A honeymoon alone in a single berth cabin. Not my idea of love. Why don't you forget him, Cora Ann? Do you think he wants me to forget him? - I don't know. He might. Is any man worth what you are suffering? Sooner or later he will be caught. If he is alive. - If he's alive. Aye. The long arm of the law will stretch out and seize him .. And the long leg of the law will boot him into prison. Will you please stop talking about my husband. Alright. Anything you wish. I am only trying to help you, Lassie. Do you mind helping me at a distance. But you attract me, Cora Ann. What am I supposed to do about that? Cheer? My dear, if only I was five years younger. Twenty-five you mean. Well, can I offer you a wee bit of advice? Medical advice? - No, no. Just friendly. It would be a good idea if you were to go right away .. Forget all about The Ringer. Find another interest. Cut him right out of your mind. I am thinking of all the time you are wasting waiting for something to happen. With that heart of yours in your mouth. Have you got some reason behind all this? Aye, I've got plenty of reasons. It is your one chance, Cora Ann. Who says so? Dr Lomond? - Aye. When Arthur Milton says: "I'm tired of you. I am sick of you. You are out". Then I will go. My way. Not your way. Goodnight. Goodnight. Excuse me, madam. But would you mind doing me a favour? The next time you see The Ringer, would you put in a good word for me? Samuel Hackett is the name. - A word in for what? I'm ambitious you see. I want to better myself and get out of the rut. There's no place like a rut, Sam. Then you know where you are. That's just it, madam. You see, a rut is a rut. I want to get out of it. A man with my experience ought to get out of the rut. Experience, did you say? - Yes. Have you seen my press cuttings? No. - Do you mind? There you are, look. That's me. With the bracelets on. I think I had better start a book on Cora Ann and forget about criminology. Where is my pencil? There is one on the desk. Oh. Thank you, Mr Meister. Tell me something. What is she doing here? You should know that. It was you she came to see. Not me. What reason have the police to think that the Ringer is here? I know they have a suspicion that he is here but .. Have they any real reason to think so? Why? Couldn't you get that out of Cora Ann? If she is here, he is not very far away. Is that what they have been telling you? They didn't tell me she was here. What kind of recommendations are those? In each one of them you've been pinched. Yes, I know. But why, why? I'll tell you why. Because I leave my trademark, see. Fingerprints? - No. That's the trouble. No fingerprints, no busted locks, no clues. So that when they see the perfect job. They know it is me. Sam Hackett. The trouble with me is that I am the victim of my own perfection. Excuse me. Alright, Samuel. I will put in a word for you. Goodnight. Tell em something, Wembury. - What? How the hell did you get landed with this Scotch comedian of yours? Dr Lomond? He's a nice old boy really. A bit irritating at time but .. After all he has precious little to do in Flanders Lane. I don't like amateurs. - He doesn't do anybody any harm. When exactly did he start this job? - About six months ago. Here to get the material for research for that book of his. He spent most of his life abroad. Somebody must have recommended him. It's a nice quiet job for an old boy in semi-retirement. Are you coming, doctor? Aye, in a minute. - Fine. It is warmer in here than out there in the garden. Don't you think so, Mr Bliss? I saw you out there. Setting a trap for The Ringer, weren't you. It's certainly a more practical way to catch criminals than writing books .. And that anthropological muck that you waste your time on. Well, that is a matter of opinion. By the way, Bliss. Have you ever noticed your ears? A typical criminal's ear. And the prognathic process of the jaw suggests a rabid homicide. Tell me. Did you ever commit a murder? Not yet. But I may any moment. How you must hate your ears. They are the most pointed I ever saw. I will be interested to see what happens to you. The last time I saw ears like that was in India. They belonged to a woman who murdered her husband. Mind, I'm not blaming her, poor soul. He was in the native cavalry. He used to go to bed in his spurs. Keep the flippancy for another time, Lomond. We've got a lot on our hands. The Ringer was a very clever criminal. There is no such thing as a clever criminal. That doctrine was inculcated into me when I was a bairn. Och aye. Toot-toot. - I resent that remark. Take care of hat hand of yours, Mr Meister. Goodnight. - Goodnight. There you are, Doc. Is it full, Samuel? - Is it full? Blimey, it's the first time I've ever measured it by the yard. I'll see you later. You will .. You'll have to put up with a lot of things, you know. People will .. Whisper behind your back. "Her husband was in prison." How will you feel about it then? Will you wish you'd never met me? But darling. If you had never met me you wouldn't have gone to prison. You wouldn't have needed that money if it hadn't been for me. All the things I planned to say. I don't know, I just couldn't. Tell me them now. Firstly, I wanted to ask you to forgive me for all the things I've promised. Never let it be said that I am not sympathetic with young love. No, no. Don't get up. I am sorry about my little outburst a moment ago, Johnny. But you see, when I expected thanks it was a little disconcerting to get abuse. I had been thinking too much shut away there. I understand. It's always a mistake. Are you still thinking of taking Lisa away tonight? Yes. - That's a pity. I shall miss you, Lisa dear. When is your train? Eleven o'clock. Look, give me two hours of her time to go over what is most urgent. Alright. - What about your packing? That's easy. I haven't got much to pack. - Go and pack now, Lisa. Then you'll have it all prepared and we can go through the work quickly. Oh, blast. What's the matter? There's a file in my office. It's vital she checks it with me. I'd get it myself but I I can't leave the house. I wonder if Lisa .. Lisa. Don't disturb her. Let her finish her packing. I'll get your file. That is very kind of you, Johnny. I'll get you the keys. It's on the top floor of 258 Piccadilly. Take a taxi and you'll be there in 20 minutes. Here's some money. - Don't worry. It is a thick green file. You will find it in the bottom drawer of my desk. Right. - 258 Piccadilly. Who's there? What's the matter? What are you doing here, Bliss? Looking after you like a father, Mr Meister. I thought your activities were confined to the outside of my house. I shan't trouble you again this evening. All my men are on duty. However, if you can't sleep, do give me a ring. I'll come and read you some bedtime stories. Goodnight. I see. 2-5-8. Piccadilly. Yes. In about twenty minutes. I see. May I have your name, please? No. No name. Hello? Hello Meister? "Hello." "Meister? Is anybody there?" Hello. "Meister." Don't move. What are you doing here anyway? Stay where you are and don't move. Right, Peters. Acting on information sir, I was at 258 Piccadilly. And I found the caretaker hurt and the office at the top entered into. Major, we arrested this man who resisted arrest. What is the charge? He is charged with being in enclosed premises for an unlawful purpose. What's your name? John Lemley, sir. Alright. Search him. I've seen you before tonight somewhere, haven't I? Well? Anything to say? Meister tipped you off, didn't he? What has Meister to do with it? He sent me to his office to get a file. He gave me those keys. It was a trap. If it is a trap as you say .. Why not stay and explain to the police? Because, can't you see, I realised I was walking into a trap. If you're innocent and the victim of a trick, why should the police hold you? Because I have got a record. I see. I .. I came out of prison this morning. Meister a friend of yours? So friendly I landed a 4-year sentence and look like landing with another one. That's how friendly we are. That's a pretty fantastic story, Lemley. Whatever it is to you, it is a real-life nightmare to me. Alright. You will be detained. Take him away. Alight. Put him in number 9. Can I call Lisa? I haven't done anything. I'm not a criminal. I want a chance to put things right with her. You're under arrest. Don't let's have any nonsense. Look, if anything happens to Lisa, I'll kill him. I warn you I'll kill him. Who is he going to kill? - Meister. It seems quite an epidemic. I want a gun. - I beg your pardon, sir? I want a revolver. - That's right, Sergeant. Inspector Bliss of Scotland Yard requires a revolver. What do you want it for, Bliss? Going wrecking? - Yes. But you don't have to worry, Wembury. - Thanks. What do you want the gun for? - What is to you? Quite a bit. This is my division you know. Any reason why I shouldn't have it? - None. I should sign for it though. What is the matter, Bliss? You seem to be forgetting the routine. I've been a long time away from this regulation-ridden country. Good evening, Mr Bliss. Evening, doctor. You seem to live here. Found The Ringer yet? Not yet. You ought to write another book, and perhaps you will. You know, sometimes I think it's folly to be wise. I wish you would ask me why. Why is it? When ignorance is bliss. Curious the Inspector doesn't know station routine isn't it, sir? Everything is curious about Mr Bliss, Sergeant. Bliss. I wonder where he got that name from. Perhaps it was his mother's. - What is Meister's phone number? 2-1-4-0 I think, sir. That's right, sir. Yes. I am worried about that boy's story. It is Mr Wembury. Tell him I am busy. Tell him there's no need for him to worry about me any longer. I am leaving the country tonight. He is leaving, He is pushing off. Yeah. For why? Well, I'll tell you for why, Mr Wembury. Cora Ann has seen him. Yeah. And for all I know I might have seen him too. Tell him I'll be over right away. I've got to see him before he goes. Draw me a gun Carter, will you. - Right, sir. What's the matter? Meister is moving out. I've got find out more about that boy Lemley before he goes. That girlfriend of yours has been up to her tricks again. You had better come along. You are the only friend she has got around here. She may need your help if I lay my hands on her. You are not going to shoot her? - Oh, come on. [ Doorbell ] Good evening. Mr Meister? He is packing. He is going away. Are your going away too? - Yes. I am waiting for my fianc?e. He is coming to fetch me any moment now. Who, Lemley? - Yes. Too bad. What's wrong? I'm afraid you must put that off for a bit. He is under arrest. What has he done? He broke in to what is known as enclosed premises, and he's charged with assault. But. But. Is he in a prison? For the time being he is just being detained. How serious is it? Very serious unless his story can be corroborated. Wembury, Doctor. How nice of you to come and see me off. Lisa dear, what is the matter? I'd like a word with you. What has happened? Where is Johnny? Where do you think he is? - He has been arrested. Is that so? - That is so. Acting on information received he was arrested this evening. I'm terribly sorry about this, Lisa dear. He was arrested in your office, oddly enough. In my office? What on earth was he doing in my office? We haven't quite cleared that up. Yet. Lisa, what stupidity have you been up to? Now of all times when .. Don't cry. I'll do everything humanly possible for him. I promise. What can you do? What can anybody do? Well, if there is a way out, you can rest assured that I will find it. Let me talk to Wembury. Look, you go up for a while, huh. Come. I've never let you down and I never will. If by any chance this matter can't be straightened out. You will come with me. You can't stay here alone and you know why. Why not let her make up her own mind? But, can't I go and see him? Not possible. Please go upstairs and wait. I can settle this matter much better on my own and time is short. That is, if you want me to help. Hackett. Have you seen Hackett? - No. Are you here again, Cora Ann? I might say the same to you. I just came to bid a fond farewell to Mr Meister but .. What is the matter? There is a queer vacant look in your eyes. The vacancy isn't in my eyes. I haven't eaten a thing since lunch. If you like, you can take me to supper. Och, I might miss some fun. If The Ringer knows that Meister is leaving. You have got some strange ideas of fun. Now, why don't you take me out to supper? Are there any restaurants around here? - Aye. But who would pay? I'll pay for it. You can come along as my Scotch gigolo. So you think I'm your type now? You'll do. I'm not feeling particular at the moment. You are very tempting, Cora Ann. It's such an economical proposition. But you nearly make me forget why I am here. Why are you here? In my professional capacity in case of accidents. Come on, I am hungry. - Now, Cora Ann. Don't lure a man away from his duty. What duty? The Ringer might feel he had something to say to Mr Meister before he left. With these police around? He wouldn't be such a madman. Not even The Ringer. I wonder how well you know him, Cora Ann. There is a look in your eyes I don't like, doctor. I'm not The Ringer's accomplice. You want to see him hang. Don't be hysterical. Your husband wouldn't like that. He might be somewhere around and it would worry him. I'll give you five minutes and no more. Doctor. - Yes? If you must make love to The Ringer's wife choose another moment and place. It would be more convenient if you went home. Why? Because I don't want two tragedies on my hands. Mr Meister. - I'm in a hurry, doctor. I think I know the reason for your burnt hand. Is that all? - Aye. There is an old transformer here. It must have worked the lift at some time. If the wires had been connected to that. It might have proved fatal. Now, are you listening to me? How about that anonymous phone call you made at the station tonight? Wembury, I am much too vain a man to impart information anonymously. You should know me better. You fixed Lemley, didn't you? For some purpose of your own. Don't let's argue, my dear fellow. Let's part friends, shall we. At least I am saving you the expense and trouble of guarding me any longer. Good evening. Mr Meister? What do you want? - I've got your tickets. I'll give them to him. - Sorry. I must get his signature for them. - Alright. Come this way. Your tickets. - Put them down, will you. Two. Can you sign this please, sir? Why two? Why two? Because Lisa is coming to America with me. Oh, so that's it. I haven't time to sift your obscure ideas, Wembury. The fact is that Lisa will decide to be realistic about this boy. There must be an end even to her patience. Thank you. Thank you, sir. So Lisa will decide, eh? There are moments Meister when I wish the police had wider powers. To carry arms perhaps, you mean? Nothing so dramatic. One fist would be enough. Give me the greater pleasure. Schoolboy stuff, Wembury. You don't know the world. Fetch Miss Lisa, will you. I'm taking this girl away from a petty small-time crook. To lift her into the big-time stuff? Strange snobberies you people have. She'll have a new life in America. - Not if she goes with you. She is going with me. Do you know something, Meister? I could cheerfully do The Ringer out of a job. It would make rather an ass of the law wouldn't it. Hackett. Hackett. Hackett! Here, you. It will only get me into trouble. Good evening, Sergeant. Look what they do to me. Why don't you stop hounding me? Trouble? I saw this man by Deptford Broadway and asked him what was in his bag. That's exceeding your duty, Constable. Go on Sergeant, tick him off. He refused to open the bag .. - Now that's a lie. Don't perjure yourself in front of witnesses. All I said was: if you want the bag, take it. Shut up, Hackett. - I then took him into custody. Yes. That's the first true words you have spoken. Look here. He came up to me and he gave me a lot of madam, see. So I said to him .. I don't want to be seen talking to a bogey at this hour of the night. And then he got the dead needle and pinched me. I ask you. I wouldn't take a liberty in your manor, now would I? What's in the bag? Ah, it's funny you should mention that. I was just going to speak about it. Well, the truth of the matter is I was walking down a dark street. It was very dark. I could hardly see, when all of a sudden .. I trod on something soft, see? I bent down to have a look. And there was the bag, so I said: "now what are you doing there"? And what did the bag say? If I am telling a lie may I be struck down this very minute. Go on. Nobody has heard you. Well, then I got my second breath, see. I thought I'd bring it up to the police station, when up comes this bogey. Alright. Let's have a look at it. What's that? A silver teapot. Well, bless my soul. If it ain't old Meister's teapot. Well, what a coincidence, eh? I was only rubbing it up this morning. Well, it doesn't matter. After all he doesn't drink tea. And Meister's cashbox. - Yeah. And a wad of money. Bad luck, Hackett. Rank bad luck. Here. It's good luck. That's what I'd call it. I should get a reward for this. Here, you count that lot will you. I know what coppers are. They'll turn up here next week in a brand-new suit. Alright, Hackett. You are charged with being in possession of property reasonably suspected .. Of being stolen or unlawfully obtained. In contravention of section 66 of the metropolitan police act .. 1839. Old, isn't it? Alright. It's a fair cop. Name? Samuel Cuthbert Hackett. Samuel. Cuthbert. Hackett. Address? Buckingham Palace. Buckingham .. No fixed abode. What was your last job? Chambermaid. Now let me pass. I know he is here and I must see my husband. I know my rights. Lord's truth. Here comes my biggest fan. Sam Hackett, it is true then. I could hardly believe my ears when they told me. Please, Mrs Hackett. It's no good, Sergeant. She never stops once she starts. Call yourself an expert? Being found with the goods son you. Why didn't you bury the stuff in the back garden and come back later for it? You're slipping, that's what you are, Sam Hackett. I told you I was out of training. - For a mouldy bit of silver like that. |Here. Haven't I seen this before? Didn't you thieve this the last time you were out and flogged it to Mr Meister? Well I like that. Flog it to Mr Meister and then pinch it back off him again. That is plain dishonest you know, Sam Hackett. Sorry Mrs Hackett. We have got to take him down now. Number 7. Quite a full house tonight. Oh .. Never mind, ducks. Perhaps I'll be home for Christmas. It will be a hard grind for me and the kids until you get back on the job, Sam. I mean, it's not as if we were married. I get no family allowance or anything. It's gone up three bob now you know. Look ducks, I'll tell you what. As soon as I get out of here, and I have done my first job. We'll make it legal, see. Slip me a bob, I'll marry you. Oh, Sam. Sarge. There is no-one in number 9. The door is open. Number 9? Lemley. Are you sure he got away? Yes, sir. The door in the station yard is open, sir. Well, get the duty car to go round and warn all the patrols. You can describe the man. When did this happen? When they took them their meals, sir. Get on to the night office of The Yard and circulate the description. Right, sir. Get on to The Yard and circulate Lemley's description right away. Right. He threatens to murder Meister and then he escapes. What am I supposed to think? Johnny doesn't think like you. He's been in prison for a long time. He thinks everybody is against him. There is a reasonable chance I might have been able to help him. But not now? - I don't know. He may have to go back. He may not. Please don't tell me one thing and then another. Please tell me. Where is he? I don't know. Probably on his way here to stop you going away with Meister. On his way here? But I'm not going away with Mr Meister. - Yeah? Well he seems to think you are. I am going to stay here even if I have to break every law there is. Ha. Like Johnny? Dear oh dear. I've never seen such a terrible mess as they've made of these burglar alarms. It is a mercy they have never been needed. Where is that electrician? He's gone home I suppose. I wish you'd gone home too. I will when I have tried to disconnect this .. Heath Robinson contraption. Well, ladies and gentlemen, this is where we say goodbye. I hope you have enjoyed my hospitality and that a good time was had by all. But now the silly game is over and I'm locking up. You'll be glad to be away. Thank you. Goodbye, Mrs Milton. Thanks for the timely warning. It is a little secret you will have to keep from your husband, I take it. Goodbye, Bliss. I shall watch the English papers for further news of your success. Goodbye, doctor. What are you doing there? - I'm just pottering. Well, stop pottering. I am locking up. Aye. I'm not coming with you. Johnny is out. He is on his way here. Out? Who said so? - He's escaped. It is a trick, Lisa. A police trick. No-one ever escapes. It's a very cruel thing Wembury to raise hope if you know the situation as I do. Better than you, shall we say? - What does that mean? You .. You say things but I don't understand what you mean. Where is Johnny? It's the old cat and mouse game, my dear. If he has escaped he'll be back under lock and key before the day is over. If he's free why not produce him, Bliss? Give us time. - Time? Not much to ask when we've a few minutes only. Can't you see it's nonsense, Lisa? Whom are you prepared to trust? Me, whom you've know for two years or the police? Who locked Johnny up and then tried to insinuate there may have been a mistake. Insinuate nothing. We haven't yet proved him guilty. That's all. You will. Get the luggage into the car. Don't be side-tracked by this nonsense, Lisa. Let's discuss it on the plane. If you feel strongly, you can always come back. There's nothing final about you coming with me. I should have no peace of mind If I left you here now, under the circumstances. Don't you see? Yes, of course you do. Now we must hurry. Where are the tickets? I think you left them on your desk. Oh yes, of course. I'm afraid there's nothing I can do. He can't just be dead like that, man. Do something quick. But he is dead. Keep your hands away from that, Bliss. Don't touch it. That's what it is. He has been electrocuted. I will go and switch off at the mains. Don't you touch that. Oh, what a terrible thing. Electrocuted, eh? The wires must have been touching the tray and acted as a conductor. And the tickets were on the tray. Yes. They took him further than he reckoned. Distilled in Australia, eh? Why the stethoscope? It was foolish of the old boy to .. Tamper with this thing, wasn't it. Someone who knows nothing about electricity. Over someone who knows a great deal about electricity. Mrs Milton. I would be grateful if you would stand just where you are. What a terrible thing. Still, you never know. Perhaps Meister was lucky to die like this. He might have met The Ringer one day and .. And then it probably wouldn't have been so painless. We think he has met The Ringer. Now what makes you say that, Bliss? Where? - You can drop the accent. Yes. It has been rather getting on our nerves. Doctor. Harry Lauder made a fortune out of it. - You won't. I don't have to. Get the police van, Wembury. Stop this nonsense. My dear chap, isn't that my whiskey? Good heavens, yes. Very special stuff. You can't get it in this country. Will you have one? You may never have another chance. I'll see to that, Doctor Lomond. So should I, but don't call me "doctor" please. It makes me feel such a fraud. You see, there was a real Doctor Lomond. A very nice old chap. He died in Australia while he was treating me for kangaroo bites. Kangaroos do bite, you know. He had very excellent credentials. Quite wonderful. Scotland Yard always insists on excellent credentials. So I borrowed them. Impersonation .. and murder. Murder? You mean this unfortunate accident to Meister? You will find it very hard to prove anything else. My dear Bliss, think again. Arthur. Oh my dear. I am so sorry. How are you? You let Lemley out of his cell tonight. Why? My dear Wembury, he had no business to be there. You know that as well as I do. Well, you won't find a good Samaritan ready to let you out once you are in. And you'll stay there for the rest of your life. I don't think Arthur would want to live as long as that. I think you had better look after the doctor. Take the car. Get some men down here quickly. Very good, sir. He is still in the house. That's certain. Did he go past here? - No, sir. Nobody passed me since I heard the shot and came in. We've a cordon round the house outside. They're sending men from the station to search inside. They arrive in minutes. Right. Do you realize where you stand, Mrs Milton? Obstructing the law. Helping a prisoner to escape. You are going to be out of circulation for quite some time. That will be a nice rest. I've done too much travelling lately. You'd better get her out of here. Come on, we'll start upstairs. Get a man to watch Mrs Milton. I'll take one off the guard outside. - No, don't do that. Listen to me, Johnny. I can come to you but we won't have a chance. Give me that. Hello? Lemley? This is Inspector Wembury speaking. Now listen to me. The sooner you realise you are in serious trouble the better. No, no. I don't want any excuses. Look. If I come round will you promise me .. And I am not making any promises. What? Well, where are you? Well come here immediately. No. No. We are going to have trouble with that young man. Who are you? - Terry, sir. "F" Division. I'm looking for a man called Lemley, here on these premises. Never mind about that now. Atkins. Bring Mrs Milton out here will you. I've seen you before somewhere, haven't I? Yes, sir. I used to be in your division, sir. 0h. Take Mrs Milton to Flanders Lane. You need another man but I can't spare one. Don't worry, sir. I can manage. I am glad to hear somebody has got so much confidence. Mr Wembury, sir. - What is it? I'd like to get back to your division if there should ever be a vacancy. I liked working with you, sir. - Did you? Goodnight, sir. - Goodnight. Where is the driver? - Searching the grounds I think, sir. Shall I take Mrs Milton to Flanders Lane and come straight back? Alright. - Right. Mr Wembury. Come here. What would happen if I kissed you? - Arthur, shut up. Tell me, what would happen? I'd only give you away like I nearly did at the police station. When Bliss came in? Poor old Bliss. They all thought it was him. Arthur, please. Where do you want to go to? Anywhere, so long as you can get us out of this. Peru? Is it warm in Peru? The sun shines all day and the moon shines all night. Let's go there then. Right. Go on, get into the house before anything more happens to you. Go and ask Lisa to keep an eye on you. Go on. Alright. On your way. Do you love me .. Cora Ann? -(t-g)-
