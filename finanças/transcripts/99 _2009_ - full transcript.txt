We're doomed! We're doomed! - We're doomed! - We're doomed, you idiot! I know we're doomed! I know! You fatso, not even the father of that baldy trusts him, - why did you trust him? - Yeah, yeah. So, I have an x-ray machine built inside me. - It's all my fault. - Keep running! Run! Wait! Wait, Sachin. Look, they're running over there. - Reverse! Reverse! - Reverse the vehicle. Do one thing. Call in the company. Drive that way. Hey, Zaramud. Can you fix up a car? How long will we keep running? Hold on, buddy. I can't zip it down. - Hurry up, pal. - One second, buddy. Damn it! - Hey. - Yes? Look over there, Sachin. By the way, Zaramud could have stolen any car. There was a Lancer. Accent. Toyota. There was also an ordinary Esteem. But the bozo chose to steal the Benz. If we want to run away, we will run away with swag. Careful. Careful. If you don't know driving, why are you driving it? - Forget it. - This isn't the time to learn driving. - Come on. - Hold it. What are you doing, Zaramud? Watch your left. You'll get us killed. - What are you doing? - I'm going, man. - Zaramud. - Where's the gear? It doesn't have gears. It's automatic, buddy. - How do I know it's automatic? - Stop. Stop. Stop. Drive ahead. Drive ahead. Hey, he'll slam into the car. Our business is very simple. People call us "line fraudsters." If you can buy a phone but can't pay its bill, then you can come to us. We don't pay bills, we make duplicate SIM cards. Our trick is very simple. Lamington Road, the place where we keep our raw materials. Also known as Mumbai's roadside Microsoft. You'll find all types of software here. Even the ones that haven't been made. Buy the software, take any SIM card and make a duplicate copy of it. We'll bring the card and the customer the cash. It's not the ISD, I'm calling from my mobile phone. Yes! It's fun, isn't it? Why wouldn't it be fun? As it's someone else's SIM card. Call as much you want. One month later, the card will be in the gutter. The real owner of the SIM card will be in deep trouble when he's slammed with an expensive bill. Chanu! We don't entertain people who we don't know. This is the rule of our business. Who told you about us? - Yes? - Yes. - Okay. - Yes? Yes. We broke this rule and closed a deal with baldy. Use it carefully. Thank you. Oh, yeah, Sachin. See what I've got. It's the latest model. Awesome. Do you want it? Keep it as a gift from me. We don't use mobile phones. It causes a lot of problems. Radiation causes cancer. If you use it up here, it will damage your brain. If you keep it here, it will damage your heart. - If you keep it there... - No chance of generation. I wonder what baldy did with the SIM card. Did he offer it to everyone, or did he chat with girls on a hotline? The company was slammed with a bill of 900,000 rupees. It spelled trouble for the phone company. They dialed 100 and spelled trouble for us, too. Run, Zaramud! We're doomed! We're doomed! You're sleeping. Wake up! Wake up, fatso! Run! Leave everything and run! - Get ahold of yourself. - Baldy squealed on us to the cops. He gave our address to them. Now we have to destroy everything. Run! Wake up. Wake up. Destroy everything. Take everything with you. - Take this photo, too. - Wait a minute. We'll be in deep trouble. Leave everything and run. Where did you find that baldy? Now we have to destroy everything. - Destroy everything. - Okay, okay. I shouldn't have trusted him. What are you doing? It has all the data. What if the cops find it? Son of a witch! - Run! Run! - Wait! Sachin! Bad judgment. Bad shot. It was an easy catch, but we dropped it. We were safe. Luckily, nothing happened to me. Well, nothing happened to fatso. These singles won't work. We need to hit a century in our life. We need to do something big. What will you do? Something exciting and big! - Something like... - Multiplex? We need to start with single screens. I was thinking of setting up a coffee shop. You want to be a coffee boy? I'm not setting up Madras Cafe. You know, like a cool joint - where friends will have fun. - Okay. - Lovers will meet. - Okay. And they can enjoy our coffee. Coffee boy, please bring me a cup of coffee. Mark my words, I will set up a cafe. Authorities from the phone company said incidents of duplicate SIM cards have occurred in the past, too. Sources reveal that the two goons who fled in the stolen car are safe. So, where are they? Let's see what a witness to the incident has to say. Two computers were thrown down onto the street. The computers shattered into pieces. The pieces of computer were everywhere. Yes. Did you see the goons? Yes, yes. They were two of them. They were like Laurel and Hardy. - What were you doing at that time? - I had to pee. My bladder was bursting. The cops were still looking for us. But the real problem was right in front of us. The man whose car we stole and demolished... Calling him a scoundrel was too polite. His name is AGM. He's a well-known bookie in Mumbai. He's going to break our bones, just like his car was broken. He's going to chop us up like minced meat. Chop them up like vegetables. Minced meat or vegetables, whatever. In the end, our fate was sealed. Are you waiting for me to get married? Go! Hey. Did he say anything about the money? - AGM. - Shut up! You scoundrels, I'm doing my work. What are you doing? Look. Where's my money? You don't have money? You don't have money? The doctor is performing surgery. And we would be next! Run! Run! Are they close? Drive fast. Run! Run! Run, Zaramud! Run! I'm going to nab him. Run! Run. Run! Nab them. Nab. Nab them. Sachin? Yes. You work together, right? You smashed my car into pieces. Look here. You left this. The key. What remains? What should I do with it? What should I put in? - Sir, it was a mistake. - Hey. Shut up, fatso. Answer what you've been asked about. Understood? Who was driving the car? - He. - Sir, he was driving. He. Me? Why? Shut up! Sir, we don't know what happened exactly. Let's do this, sir. We'll buy you a new car. - Which color do you want? - Hey. If you applied for a loan, the bank wouldn't even lend you money for a bicycle. And you'll buy me a new car? Anyway... you've caused me losses. Now you have to pay for them. - I'll give you a break. - Thank you, sir. - Three million. - What? Three. - Sir, it was a car, not a plane. - Hey. I'll slap you so hard, you'll see planes everywhere. Hey! That car was more precious than a plane to him. Did you know that he took it from a famous cricketer? You bonehead, did I ask you to say anything? Shut your mouth. So, where were we? Oh, yeah. You'll have to pay for the losses. - Four million. - What? - Sir. You just said 3 million. - Fifty. It will be 60 if you open your mouth again. - But... - Shut up, Zaramud. - What Zara? - Zaramud. - Where should I turn? - It's his name. It's a long story, sir. Childhood story, sir. It's my nickname, Zaramud. Actually, he used to call girls by this name. - Sir. - Hey, shut your mouth. Look, buddy. You guys look poor. How will you repay me? We don't have the money, sir. I have a plan for repayment. So, the plan is... you work for me now. You have to do everything for me. If you don't do what I say, I'll chop you up. This was a career shift. We had a good business. Now we'll have to wag our tail behind someone else. Since AGM is bowling, forget century, it would be better to stay on the pitch. What am I doing here? Creepy Y2K conference. Nothing's going to happen. I should be at home watching TV. Watching a cricket match. I would have placed a bet. Should I place a bet or not? Dear God, give me a signal. Please. Anything. Any sort of signal. Let's see. If I can pull this label off in one go. If the tea-seller doesn't trip on the wire... Or if this marker doesn't fall down... It didn't fall. That's great. Three signals! Now I'll have to place the bet. I have a theory based on luck. Everyone has luck. But every luck has its time. You just need to identify the time. For this, there's some signal. You just need to identify the signal. You get my point, don't you? Who...? Who are you? I told you... I came from Delhi. Rahul. I was here for a conference. - So, I wanted to bet. - Do you think this is a mall? You can just roam around? - I'm here to bet. - So? - Who told you about me? - Bhuval Ram Kuber. How much more dirt is left to ruin Delhi? Can't even buy a cigarette, but they want to bet. They like to place big bets, but once they lose, they hide in a corner like a rat. Kuber, please give me two more days. - Just two more days. - That's it? Are two days enough? No problem. As you wish. Till then, I will seize your wife, TV and everything else. If you lie, the crow will bite you. Understood? Just two more days. Two days. Dimple, shut his mouth. - Kuber, just two days. - Hello? Kuber, two... Hello, Bhuval Ram Kuber this side. Who's speaking? - I'm your godfather. - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello?! If you utter "hello" one more time, I'll wring your neck. Oh, AGM! Hail India. You've lived long. I was just thinking about you. Forget about long life. Cut to the chase. Do you know Rahul? Yes, I know. Not just one, I know six men named Rahul. All of them are... He's saying that you sent him to me for betting. Oh, that guy. He's the one who bores everyone with his theory. Yeah, he bored me, too. Tell me something, how's his credit? Around 2.5 million. He was begging me. He wants to go to Mumbai. He wants to place big bets. So, I suggested you. So? You want to place a bet? - Who do you want to bet on? - India. How much? - Four hundred thousand rupees. - How much? You cheapo! Here in Mumbai, you've to place a minimum bet of 2 million. Two million? Two million is a lot. You pissed me off with your nonsense theory. Now what happened to your signal? You have confidence in your theory, don't you? - So, why are you scared? - No, 2 million is too much. Look. Listen to me. What will you earn from 400,000 rupees? What will you have? You will earn billions if you place a bet of 2 million. Place a bet of 2 million on India. If you win, you'll make a quick mint. A quick mint. If you lose, you'll have to repay me in three months. I don't even give a week to others. But I'll give you three months, okay? - Bhiku. - Yes, boss. - Take down his details. - Okay. Who do you want to place your bet on? Taxi? And the last batsman is out. That was a great performance. New Zealand performed well with the bat and bowl. New Zealand kept the Indian team under pressure from the start. New Zealand won by 48 runs. The series has been leveled 2-2. Let's see which team wins the final match. The final match will be played at Feroz Shah Kotla stadium. Every cricket match is fixed. It's always fixed at a certain level. So, you mean to say the series was already fixed? Yes. India versus New Zealand. Five ODI's. India wins two matches. New Zealand wins two matches. The final match is going to played in Feroz Shah Kotla, Delhi. It was already decided. There are only two religions in this country. Cricket and films. It doesn't matter if the film script is done in time, but cricket is already scripted. The year 2000. Even the calendar struck a century. Thanks to AGM, we're still sitting at the pavilion. Now it's the time of the Internet. A new style of post office is everywhere. Zaramud thinks we can earn a lot of money in this field. But I think it's just like a fashion trend. It will die in a few years. Not like a coffee shop. Even AGM has set up his own cafe. Come here, Internet. Come here. But the Internet is just an excuse. All the illegal work takes place here. On the first floor. Betting. Loans. Fraudulent activities. Here, they don't check e-mails. They just keep tabs on fraudsters. Now, what's this new problem? It isn't a problem. It's an Excel sheet. Everything is organized. What have you done? According to the receivables, I have written the names of people in descending order. The list contains the names of people from whom we have to collect money. On the right is the principal amount and on the left is the interest. See what I mean? I warned you, start studying. Start studying. Are you really an engineer? I could have been. I took admission in the first year. - In the second year... - Hold on, hold on. Actually, I made this list. Okay, okay. - Is there any prize distribution here? - No. Do your work. Anyone who hasn't given us money, break off their legs. Break his leg first. What are you looking at? Call Cable Pandey. - Cable Pandey? - He's a Bhojpuri actor. But he thinks he's some Hollywood star. Boss, he disconnected. Rascal. He thinks he's Jack Nicholson. He disconnected my call. He disconnected my call! Does he think I'm some fool? I even met a fool from Delhi. Take it. Take it. It's the offering. No, thanks, sir. I'm on a diet. I can see why. So, where were we? A fool from Delhi came here with some calculation. "Boss, my calculation never goes wrong." So, why didn't his calculation work out with me? I cracked a joke, bozo. - Call him. Call him. - What's his number, boss? Here. You can ask me. Useless. Even he doesn't answer my calls. Every time, I hear some chick's voice. I'll stop lending money to people outside Mumbai. - Boss. - Yes. The person you're trying to call is unavailable. - Hello? - Please leave a message. Look. Here she is. Actually, sir, it's the answering machine. You will have to leave a message after the beep. - After what? - The beep. - What do I have to leave? - Message. Message. Message. AGM calling from Bombay city. - Mumbai. - Mumbai city. Yes. Back call. Number. Six-four-nine-seven-two-seven-two. Yes. Call back, okay? Good night. Take care. Hey, I will slap you. Scumbags. Look, engineer. I want my money. Do anything. Break hands or legs. Do whatever you want. But I want my money back with interest. - What's wrong? - You mean, I should go there? - Yes, you. - Why me? You have so many men. Send any one of them. All of you, boneheads. Try to act smart at work. Look, if you don't want to go alone, then... - Take him with you. - No, no. We can't adjust in Delhi. If I go in October, I'll die of heat. And during March, there's winter. - Winters in March? - I heard it's full of criminals. - Yes, everyone is a criminal, sir. - Yes. The moment you are not attentive, you lose your luggage. They even install a disco ball in a red car with the music system. The city is full of processions. They play "Bhangra" remix loudly by lowering the car's window. And what should I say about the women, sir? - There's no variety. - What was that DT? - DTM. - Dehati Turned Modern. There are just two names in Delhi. Pooja and Neha. We'll end up getting sick. Both of you go! All in. I'll match it. I'm adding... 100,000 rupees more. Really? You're bluffing. One hundred percent. You are not that good. Give me some signal. Anything. Stroke your hair. Clear your throat. Rick, I want 200,000 rupees. I will return you in five minutes. Look, after four months, I'm able to set this game. I will return it to you with double interest. Forget the interest, don't mess with JC. - You know what he can do, don't you? - Listen, Rahul. There's one more option in the game. You can fold. Fold. Learn to limit losses. Fine. My car is parked outside. Now it's yours. That crap? What are you saying? Do you have any idea of its mileage? It has vintage value. Five minutes. Let's take a bet. Show. Dear God, if I win, then 15 percent. Ten percent would be yours. Okay, 15 percent. Okay. We'll negotiate, okay? Twenty-five percent, okay? Thank you. He was lucky today. But remember, I will defeat you someday. One hundred percent. I have a theory based on luck. - Everyone has luck. - Large whiskey. Okay. Cheers. Sir. Sir. - Sir, are you from Mumbai? - Yes. Really? Then you must be from the film industry? Why? Because you're from Mumbai, sir. Is that so? So, all the people from Delhi must be politicians, right? Sir, I just asked because you have a very good personality. - Sir. - Hey, I saw this circle ten minutes ago. He's cheating us. Sir, what are you saying? Sir, there are many circles like this in Delhi. It doesn't have narrow roads like Mumbai. Sir, I would like to tell you one more thing. I'm not like the other drivers. As long as you're in Delhi, I will be at your service. Who said it's winter in Delhi during March? Hello, sir. How are you? You are here, too. - Do you want a VCD? - Get lost. I have all types of films, sir. Hollywood. Bollywood. I also have meeting-based films. Single, double, triple. Which one? Should I go to work or should I watch your blue films? What are you saying, sir? It's not mine, it's international. - Sir. - Now go away. Sir, please make my day. Please take something. Do this. Take this briefcase. Look, it's fading away. Take something, sir. Are you the only person who sells briefcase in Delhi? There are many outlets. Why should I buy it from you? What are you saying, sir? You can take such big risks while betting. - What's wrong with this? - Hey! Who told you about the betting? Stay away from the peon at my office. No, no, I was talking about the briefcase, sir. No problem. You can buy something else. I have many other things in my shop. The day I start buying from you, I'll stop betting. Sir, if not for you, buy it for someone else. I have gift items. Buy something for your wife. It's Jahnavi's. - Sir, should I pack something? - I'll slap you! Get lost! - How much? - Fifteen rupees. Here. - I don't have change. - You don't have change? How could I forget her birthday? Now she'll stay with her mom. - Sachin, let's go. Let's go. - What happened? Look at this hotel, buddy. A cuppa costs as much as a full-blown meal. You're a big man. Think big sometimes. I need money to think big. Do you have the money? I do. - Look at this. - What's this? I got AGM power. Now you go get it. Have you gone mad? It's AGM's card. He just gave it to us to buy the plane tickets. Don't mess with him. He's insane. Let's go, buddy. I'm not comfortable. It's the five-star hotel culture. Let's go. Come on. Why can't I? - Sir, I'll have to check the system. - What system? Have you heard about Laxman Dubey? I'm his nephew. I can buy the entire hotel. This is the system. If you've decided to die, then it's fine. But I have a lot of time. Let's go. Come on. Come on. Let go! Let's go over there. Is that the way you treat your customer? I was booked for the penthouse suite and you're giving me the normal one. Where is the manager? Manager? Sir, I'm the floor manager. Neha, you can go inside. I'll deal with this. Is there a problem? You people are the problem. When you don't know how to do the business, why don't you just stop it? - Sir, please. Mind your language. - You mind your language. You know who am I? Done? I need to check in. I can buy the hotel in a minute. Understood? Where is the owner? Owner? Please, calm down, sir. I can check the system if you want. What do you mean by calm down? You witch... - Take him out. He'll be fine. - Yes, let's go to India Gate. - What happened? - Careful. Nothing. Just an accident. - He's fine. Hi. Can I get a room? - Of course. I'll... I'll just check. Anyway, I'm sorry. Sorry? Maybe you lost an important customer because of me. Don't worry about it. - Is he okay? - Should be. Zaramud is with him. - Ma'am, should I? - Neha, you can take a break. - Okay. - I'll handle this. She is Neha and you're Pooja, right? - How'd you know? - I just guessed. - I mean, it's written on your name tag. - Right. Mr. Atmaram Gyanshekhar Maachwan. By the way, people call me Sachin. Right. Jahnavi. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Go in, Mom. Jahnavi. Jahnavi. Jahnavi. Go away. Go away. Why have you come here? Sweetheart. Sweetheart. Please, five minutes. Just five minutes, then I'll leave. Please. What? Why are you here? I told you not to come. I don't want to talk to you. I came to give you a surprise on your birthday. Really? You realize how late it is? I went to buy a gift. That's why I'm late. Happy birthday. What is this? Open it. Open it. Open it. Your first mobile phone. The smallest on the market. The antenna has been pushed inside. And there are many games. Snake games. The most important thing. I have installed a special ringtone for you. And this is for me. It was used in The Matrix. Hello, Mr. Anderson? So, you went to buy a new mobile phone for yourself and you bought this for me. No. I went to buy a mobile phone for you and I thought... of buying one for me. Fine. If you want, you can keep this. The only problem is, it has many features. It has "Snake 2" and yours has "Snake 1." So, I thought you can try your hands with "Snake 1," and later you can graduate to "Snake 2." Okay, I think you should have it. Come on, take it. No, no, I don't want. In fact, I don't even want this. - Keep this, too. Keep it. - Please. - Keep it. - Please. Please. Please. It must be very expensive. Your birthday isn't daily. Where did you get the money to buy it? Rahul, have you started again? When I said I've stopped, that means I've stopped. - I promise you. - You're not lying, are you? God promise. - Come back home. - No. - No. No way. - No, no. Okay, okay. How about... - if I stay over here? - No! Please? Sweetheart. - Sweetheart. - What? Sweetheart, can I come inside? I'll sleep on one side. You won't even feel that I'm sleeping there. I won't disturb you, sweetheart. Sweetheart, please. Please go to sleep. Mom will wake up. What dignity. The phone didn't change anything. Hi, Neha. Is Pooja here? There she is. - Thanks. - You're welcome. This is great. Ring the bell and a beautiful girl is at my service. I wish life was simple like that. Ring the bell and fulfill your fantasy. Had life been that simple, then why would I come at your service? I'd have rung the bell myself. Point. Anyway, it's my shift. Why are you up? I have a problem. My sleep is off-duty. Let's go for a ride. Maybe for a coffee? At this hour? This is Delhi, not your Mumbai. This city sleeps at night. And anyway, I can't leave the hotel. So, who's asking you to go out? So, this is your idea of a ride? What are you talking about? It's beautiful. Why? You didn't like it? No, I know. Is this your trick to get all the girls on a date? Well, not everyone. But I use this trick for special ones. Really? So, till now, what's your score for the special ones? Around 380 or... Just kidding. Not even one. Why? Because I have to hit a century in my life. What century? This coffee sucks. By the way, Pooja... the five-star rating of this hotel is just for the namesake. - It's fine. - Fine? Do you know, people's taste for coffee is ruined by having coffee like this. But remember, when I set up a coffee shop, people will realize what real coffee tastes like. Coffee shop? Like a tea stall? "Tea stall." No. A coffee parlor. A cool place to hangout. By the way, tell me something. How many places do you know in Delhi where I can get good coffee? Forget Delhi, any other place? Not even one. My coffee joint would be a place where you'll have varieties of coffee. People will go crazy for it. You can make a mint. - I think it's a really good idea. - Isn't it? Yeah. I want to do the same thing. Something on my own. You? I thought you're happy with your job. No at all. Owning something is better than working for someone else. Point. Hail India. - Welcome, Mr. Rahul. - Dubey. How are you? - I'm doing well. - I was thinking about you. Really? How should I repay you? I like it. So, the cash must be ready. Give it here. Of course. Gentleman. Will a check do? - What? - Do you have a pen? A check? You think I'm a bank or some ATM? - Dimple, take him. - No, no, no, wait! Give me one more week. I'll pay you, 100 percent. - Dimple. - Just a minute. Okay, fine. My car is yours, just for a week. - This crap? - It gives good mileage. We'll need to pull it with a rope. Checking. What is this? - What are you doing? - What are you hiding here? Mobile! You must've paid hard cash for this, right? You have money to buy this but no money to give me? Dimple? How is it? - It's a nice phone. - It's the same phone used in The Matrix. Hello, Mr. Anderson. I see, Hollywood? What are its features? - It has got memory, ringtones, WAP. - WAP? I don't know what WAP is. Maybe a new technology. - No problem. - Snakes. - Snake? - "Snake 2." - The game. - Oh, a game as well? Now this is mine. Kuber, I got that for my wife. Please. If you don't mind. Please. Look, if you don't pay my 700,000 within a week... then only God can help you. Oh, God! Shera! Hey, Dimple, will this snake come out of the phone? Ganguly is so strong through the off-side that bowlers are starting to bowl more at his pads. And as you find with a very good player, he's learning to play better and better... - We'll be polite with him. - Yes, you do it. You should talk to him. Is Rahul there? Hi, my name is Sachin and this is my friend, Zaramud. We both are from Mumbai. What is it? Can we come in for two minutes? Sorry, not interested. - Darn it! - He thinks I'm a salesman! Still you want to treat him well? - I didn't mean that. - Now I'll threaten him. You think you're smarter than me? I'm not new at this. - You think I can't handle it? - Let me talk. I said I'm not interested! See? Not interested? Have this! This is the correct method. Come, come, come. Did you understand? Bring us our money now. - I have nothing on me right now. Okay. - You rascal. - I have a solution. - Bring it on. But first... - Can I have a glass of water? - What? - Strange! - Is this your house or ours? Zaramud, get a glass of water. - Why should I go? Why it's always me? - Please. I hate doing all this! Thank you. - Give it to him. - Here, water. - You're going good. - Thank you. Drink it, quick! Come on. Shall we speak now? Look, I need a week more, I'll give you the money then. A week won't do. - Okay, Friday? - No, we got no time. - Saturday? - Are you bargaining? - He thinks he's smart. - Okay, Friday. - I'll bash him now. - Be quiet. I'll pay you by Friday, 100 percent. Tell me something, if you have nothing on you now, - then how can you arrange it by Friday? - He'll steal it. - I have a plan. - What plan? I have it. Hey! Are you fond of suspense? - Tell me or I'll bash you. - Speak! Give him a chance, please. Okay, I'll tell you. On Friday... there's this match that I'll bet on. I'll win it and return your money. - Clap for him, what a plan! - What if you lose? No chance. I know the system and I'm good with calculations. - I have full confidence. - Oh, I see! - Confidence? - Confidence! You left this confidence in Delhi to bet in Bombay? It doesn't happen every time. I fail sometimes but... this time, I'm sure. You, fortune teller! You know everything, right? Look at the match and tell me, what will happen at the next ball? - Tell us. - Go on. - Now? - Yes, now. He's gonna whip it away. Here again, through that extra cover area, might have to be a rethink for Hansie Cronje. Might have to go a little wider. Okay. But just a fraction of width. He's paid the penalty. Saurav Ganguly is playing shots. - We know that, what next? - I can see that. According to my calculations, he'll try to hit a shot, and probably in the next ball, - he'll be catch out. - Out? Directly out! Saurav Ganguly will probably be out. - Look here. - Yeah, we're watching. He's gone this time, he was looking to take the aerial route. - Strange. - So... Friday? Okay, done, but after that, I won't remind you again. What I was saying is, the match is on Friday, so is it okay if I pay you on Saturday? Hey! Friday, that's it. Lock it. - Friday. - Friday late night? - This jacket is nice. Whose is it? - My wife's. It fits me. It's too cold in Delhi. Shall I keep it? - I'll return it on Friday. - Okay. See you on Friday. Have the money ready. - Let's go. Do you have anything my size? - Come on. And his colleague's enjoying every moment of it. Okay, listen. Just listen. First of all, I'm sorry I over-reacted a bit. And thanks for the gift. It's very cute, thank you. Seriously, instead of giving me gifts, you could've told me wholeheartedly. Strange! You're quiet. I can't believe this. - Okay, I have to go now. Bye. - Bye. She hung up on me. It's her again? Hello, who's this? Mr. Bhuval Ram Kuber, this side. Talk to me. Who? Mr. Bhuval Ram Kuber, import-export business king. Where is Rahul? Rahul isn't my wife, he doesn't report to me. This is Rahul's phone, right? It was, but now it's mine. Are you a thief? Strange! Rahul took my money. And you're saying that I'm a thief? What is this? What nonsense? This is impossible. What are you talking? It is true. Okay, how much money did he take from you? I'll pay. Now, this is talking business. It's 700,000 rupees. - Seven hundred thousand? - Only. I'm not the only one he owes money to. There are more people as well. Is Rahul there? At this moment he's not here. But I'll tell him that you called. By the way, who are you? No one! She hung up again. - Hello? - Hello, Kuber, did anyone call you? I'm not your secretary. Kuber, please. Don't pick up anyone's call. Okay? Now he hung up. - Hello? - I told you not to pick anyone's call. But you called me! - How do you know that? - By your voice. Voice comes after, I just told you not to pick up anyone's call. I ask you not to pick up anyone's call from now. Please. But I picked up someone's call. What? Who was it? I don't know, I asked, but she didn't tell me. - She was angry. - She? Yes, yes, female. I saw her name flashing. January. It was Jahnavi! Kuber, you rascal. - Talk with respect! - Sorry, Kuber. All right. He hung up again. Let's call... - You lied to me. - No, Jahnavi, I didn't. Listen, I don't want to talk to you. Jahnavi, please listen to me. I can explain everything. I don't want to listen. I'm fed up with your explanations. You were giving me presents, right? This is what was left to gift? Liar. Oh, right, right. This matter came up long ago. Listen, the matter is... I apologized on your behalf. I was feeling guilty. Thank God, that stupid guy picked up the phone. Don't call me anymore. What is this, Jahnavi?! This is too much! Jahnavi? When are you paying me? Friday, right? Friday. How many days till Friday? What shall we do till then? Behold, everyone! Behold, everyone! Here comes the Delhi destiny. Pooja, hi, I'm ready. - You are looking ready. - Thank you. Where are you going? How would I know? I thought you're taking me. What? Some desires of my heart were bad Some were good. I followed the first lane And ended up here. I wrote your name on the streets I stopped midway And called out your name. This city is lucky With people like us living in it. Here comes the superior Here is the superior. The new superiors of here. Behold, everyone! Behold, everyone! Here comes the Delhi destiny. I never took anyone's advice I never lost my temper on anyone That's my nature. Whoever tried to test our patience We never spared them. Whatever we dreamt for We achieved it. We went on our own fun ride I forgave the one Who did me wrong. Here comes the superior Here is the superior. The new superiors of here. Behold, everyone! Behold, everyone! Here comes the Delhi destiny. One cigar, please. Not betting today? I came to bet, but I'm waiting for the signal. Didn't you go to London? No. I am where the cricket is. After all, that's the real game. Are you betting? Yeah, I'm thinking. Any tips? Tips are meant for waiters, not for people like you. I'll lose one bet today. I'm all messed up. With whom are you betting? There's this guy named Dev. He's been cleaning up. Do you know him? The tabla player? He's a kid. He keeps on tapping his fingers on the table. Watch his fingers carefully. When he's about to bluff... he taps fast. Really? If this is true, then it can be useful. So, you recognize people this way? Every player gives a sign. There's no player who doesn't. So, this is how you took all my money? What was my sign? That's not fair, if I tell you, then how will I win? You won't win every time. Someday, I'll beat you. Cheers. Rahul, really. All the taxi drivers here think they're smart. They're all the same. If I look somewhere for a second, they steal the belongings. Thank God, they don't steal clothes. Here, 50,000 dollars. I'll call you once I get the best trade in a couple of days. - A couple of days? - Maybe, three days. In this office, you're the one whom I trust the most. So, I've come to you. Okay. Hello? Shubu, this is Jamodia Das. Okay, just a minute, hold on please. Okay, Mr. Rahul, I'll be going. Do it as soon as possible. - Two to four days. - Okay, okay. Talk fast. Incoming is chargeable as well. Okay, tell me. Rahul Vidhyarti? Good morning, Mr. Student. - How come you're here? - I liked your office. Why don't you pull some scam with foreign exchanges? Directly from office accounts to your account. You've gone mad. Anyway, did you arrange for the money? Today? Today is not Friday. Friday will come soon enough. No time left. Look, we're sick of Delhi. So, we thought of troubling you. If you don't give me the money, I won't spare you. AGM is not related to us in anyway. - What shall we do till Friday? - Good question. - Till Friday. - Will you have tea? Tea? I'll have coffee. - Coffee. - Coffee? - Coffee. - Okay. Hey! We aren't here for tea or coffee! That's your problem. If we're sweet, you play us. - Sir? Did Jamodia go? - Come back after lunch. - But, sir... - Come later. - Sir, the dollar... - I said, come after lunch. Okay, sir. Friday! I want the money by Friday. That's it. I'll pay you 100 percent. - Money on Friday! - Okay, don't come here again. Hey, let's go, Zaramud. Come on! It wasn't that good. It wasn't that delicious. You should've bashed him. You were more of a decent guy and less of a bully. - Just a minute. - What? What? - Dollar convert. - Come later. Come! Come on! Hurry up! Enough fooling around, take out my money now. - What money? - Money? What is in this? No, no. There's only files in it. - If anyone sees us, I'll lose my job. - Open it! - Please. - Open it, open it. - Show me. - Please sit down. - Open it. - I'll show you, there's nothing. You want to see? It's just files, nothing else. See. There's nothing. - Okay? - Show me! Zaramud, check it out! - Let him see! - People are watching us. - Nobody's watching. - Get back, get back. - Check it properly. - Yeah, let me. There's nothing! What are you doing? What is this?! Smart guy! - This isn't mine. - Not yours? Great, now it's ours. This belongs to my customer. If... If I don't return it, I'll get into trouble. Hey, Rahul Vidhyarti! Paying AGM is your problem. And about paying your customers, that's your problem. We fool the people and you're fooling us? - Fooling us? - Listen, I have a plan! - Listen to me! - What? Listen! I'll give you three times more money. Guaranteed. - What? - Get away! Be it three times or five times, you won't get this bag. I'll get in trouble. You were already in trouble when you bet with AGM. Don't test my patience. We're going. My jacket! - My jacket. - Hey, Sachin. Please, please. - Easy, easy. - Get lost. - Zaramud, Zaramud. - Come on! Meet me in the evening for tea. - Come on. - Yeah, okay. Don't worry. I'll do it in no time. Hurry up! It's all done, get in. Hurry up! Come on. Drive fast! How far is the airport? Hey! Which route are you taking? Take the main road. The highway is jammed. There's some construction. Bill Clinton is coming, so there's a lot of traffic. See? They're cleaning the streets. I guess they're cleaning every little thing. Don't worry, this is a shortcut. - We're stuck, man! - Who put this here? - Where the heck are you? - Hey, Zaramud. Hey, you! At least, I should have said bye to Pooja. Just that? You could've said, "I love you." - You started hitting on her. - Shut up! - It's nothing like that. - You're definitely in love! - She's a nice girl. - Yes, she is. She's not like the others. - She's helped us a lot. - Us? How come? She just helped you, not us. You're the hero. Oh, you're blushing! Show me your face. Show me! Oh, so sweet. Your cheeks have turned red. So nice! - Shall I play a song? - Yeah, go on. Do you want a romantic setting? Hey! She meets me in my dreams. That's not good. It's too old. Hey, Zaramud, a bag like ours. It's our bag! Zaramud! Hey! Stop! Stop! Sachin! Sachin! Briefcase! Zaramud! There's money in the briefcase! Check in the car! AGM will kill us. Yeah. He'll kill us for sure. - I have an idea. - No, just drop it. - What if we borrow money from someone? - No use. - But can't we go to someone's house? - Do you want to die? - What if we go to his house? - We have no time. We're out of options. All except one. I can't believe it! I just can't believe it. Everyone in Delhi is a thief, that's not our fault. Are Bombay people all idiots? Can't you put up your own money? - This isn't your father's office! - Don't shout. - Let's talk outside. - What's left to talk about? Yeah, okay, but you were talking... about tripling the money, what was it? Yes, but we need money for that. - What is the triple of zero? - What? Idiot! It's zero! Okay, why are you worrying about the money? I'll arrange the money, you just tell me the idea. What? Your plan. Plan. Correct. My plan is... to bet on... To bet on the next match and win. Well, not exactly. But this time, if we had money, I could've tripled it. Guaranteed. One hundred percent! That means... - you know who's gonna win the match? - No! We're dead! Totally dead! But I know the person who knows who will win. Who? - JC. - Now who is he? He's a big businessman and a gambler, too. He knows cricket better than anyone else. I've heard he fixes matches. He bets millions, so why does he wait for the match results? - So? - So... he lives in London, but for this series, he's in Delhi and staying at your hotel. Okay, so? So, we'll bet on the same team he bets on. - What next? - Next? - And then? What? That's it? - Yes. Just a minute, where's the plan in this plan? But how will we know which team JC bets on? You're a goon, right? So, you find out. - We're in trouble. - Yes, we are. Sachin! Sachin! Sach! Sach-va! Sach-vindar! Sach-mola! Sachin-to! - Sachin-ta! Wake up! - Let me sleep! Zaramud, are you crazy?! - Go away! - Sachin! Sachin! I have a plan! - Hello? - Hello, Rahul, Jamodia Das speaking. Hello, Mr. Jamodia, how are you? I'm well. I still haven't had the dollars converted into Indian rupees. Really? I'll check and let you know, there should be no problem. - Please. - No problem, Mr. Jamodia, no problem. Okay. Hey, listen, your in-laws have come. You? Again? Did you get the money? But we have a plan. And we have to work hard for this plan to succeed. But first I have to beg. - No! No way! - But listen to me. Please, please, Pooja! Only you can help me! Aren't you ashamed? You've only just met me and you're asking for such a favor? "Just met me"? Look, Pooja, it didn't take much time to help you out with that rascal customer. Consider that and help me. Shame on you! Asking for a return favor? No, I'm not asking for a return favor. Now, you don't know me well, but later, you will, right? You'll help me when we're closer, right? - So, I want your help in advance! - What are you saying? You have no idea the trouble I'll face. Pooja, you'll be in trouble, that's the future. I'm already in trouble, that's the present. Nothing will happen. Don't worry. - Trust me, trust me. Nothing will happen. - Trust you? I don't know anything about you except your name, not even your profession. No, really! What do you do? I... I recoup money from people who don't pay. Only from the ones who don't pay. So, you're a goon, right? No, no, I'm not! I'm not, I mean, I'm not that kind. I work as an administrator. I hope you understand. I understand everything. I thought you were different from the others. Thanks. But now I realize that you're a moron. Me? Moron? What does that mean? Hello? Step 2, we'll have to steal JC's mobile. Just for two minutes. Please be careful. Don't beat him. - Why beat him? - I'll lose my job, okay? Careful. - I'm ready, I'm ready. - What? - Just a second. Are you going in? - Yes. Try to understand, your size has its limitations. I'll do it quickly. Why is it always you? I feel like a movie extra. You, Sachin, and I, Dravid. Today, I'll be Sachin and you wait. Zaramud, listen to me. Just a minute, step aside. It can get violent. What? If I could only get shoes my size... Perfect. So, Mr. Dravid, you've already reached the pavilion. - Shall I go? - Yes, yes, go on, be the hero. The shower has started. Take this tray with you. It'll look realistic. Did he order something? I knew it. It's not going to work. You're just crazy. Stupid! Stupid! Stupid! - That hurt. - Good. I suppose you were a hero, right? - Stupid! - It's not about being a hero, Pooja. I had to take a risk. We didn't get caught though. Why am I doing this? I don't even know you that well. I'm helping you for no reason. You think I'm a fool and you're taking advantage. - Advantage? - Yeah. You think I'm taking advantage? Really? I asked you to help because I thought there was something... - Something... - Something what? I thought there's some connection between us. Like partners in crime. Partners in crime, huh? - Can't offer a better partnership? - What else can I give? Why would I help you for charity? You have your own dreams, so do I. - I want partnership in the coffee shop. - Coffee shop? Coffee shop? So, you are using me? What? That's what you did! Okay, I'll think about it. First, get me his phone. Why don't you pick his pockets? It's easy. I mean, you people are good at it anyway. Crap! We're in trouble again. "It's a master plan. Sachin, Sachin!" You could've listened to me. - Give me my drink. Large. - Yes, sir. Hello, sir. Where's the men's room? It's right there, sir. - Just through there. - Okay, thanks, Pooja. Give it to me! Give it to me! Hey! What are you doing? You'll get me in trouble. Hurry up! Come on! - Note the number! Give me a pen. - Pen, pen! - I don't have a pen. - Crap! Don't forget the numbers. Keep these numbers in your mind, 8-9-9-1-9-2-0. - 8-9-9-1-9-2-0. - And you, 8-0-5-0-1-3. The rest, I'll remember. 1-7-7-4-5-3. - He's coming! Crap! - Don't forget the numbers! - Do it fast! - Hurry up! - Hurry up! - Hurry up! - I said this won't do. - Come on, do it fast! Hurry up! Wait! I'm doing it! Hold on! - All done! All done! - Hurry up! - Give me the phone! - Careful! Every mobile has a special number. That is, the IMSI number. If I get these numbers, I can make a duplicate one. And that duplicate SIM card can help us tap all of his conversations. You don't use a mobile phone, but you know everything. Sir, the problem with the mobile phones is, if you're on a call, it'll affect your brain. If you keep it here, it'll affect your heart. And if you keep it here. - Then it'll affect the next generation. - Yeah! His technology was mind blowing! Connect a recorder to the phone having the duplicate SIM card. Even if he breathes, it will be recorded. I agree that your plan is set, but there's still one problem left. We don't have the money. Nobody will give me money here in Delhi. I know that, Uncle Rahul. How much do I have to pay him? - Twenty for AGM. - Plus interest. - Then? - And we have to pay him 50. Twenty for the office and seven for Kuber. What's the total, Zaramud? I don't know. It's a big amount. I know that. How much for the bet? What's the point? We don't have any money. There's one option. - Our Excel sheet. - Are you crazy? I'm not gonna mess with him, or fall into this trap. Okay, I'll do it. I won't talk to him. Count me out. One, two, three, four. Cut, cut, cut. Music cut! This Bollywood, you know, it's forgotten its grass roots. It's forgotten its roots. You know, these producers, they're making movies for NRls. Who'll think about the people of this country then? Who's going to reach out to them? Tell me. So, what do you feel, sir? Will Bhojpuri movies reach them? Of course they will! Why won't it? And mark my words. We'll even bring in Amitabh for Bhojpuri movies. Why didn't you warn me? I would've picked you up myself had you just called. It's okay. But you're causing problems for us. What are you saying? Trouble and me? - No, no. - Of course you are! You don't even answer our calls. - So, the Mumbai number was AGM's? - Yes! I made a huge mistake. - I thought... - You thought that AGM would forget if you don't answer his call. That he would let you go. He won't come to Delhi to beat you up. But why think like that? We're here to beat you up. Okay, okay. Don't create a scene here. I'll arrange for your money. I'm really busy right now, though. You. Baby! I've given you enough respect! Act this way in front of the camera, not me, okay? - I'll punch you and break your teeth! - Mr. Kewal. Can you give me your autograph? Well, I'm a huge fan of yours. I've seen many of your movies. Especially Hindi. - Sir? - Rakhee? Why don't you put on some clothes, or you'll catch a cold. Go, I'll be there in five minutes. Go. The thing is, Sachin, I can't arrange for so much money on such short notice. If I could just get another month, I'll pay up. You won't be alive to pay up if we wait another month. Isn't there anything else you can do? Something in middle? Look, pal. How much do we need to make AGM happy? What drama is this? Three? - Are you sure? - Yes. Well, okay. Do this. Give us half the money now and the rest next month. I'll talk to AGM myself. Only because your problem is genuine. And also because my friend here is a genuine fan of yours. Mr. Kewal? Can you please give me your autograph right now? Because you may not give it to him later. I'll give you the money and the autograph. - Sure? - You'll surely get it! Mr. Kewal, your shot is ready. I have to go, but don't worry, I'll give you the money. - Go! - Okay, I'll leave now. I'm leaving, boss. Okay, then. - I'm coming, is the shot ready? - Learn something! Fat idiot, you were just sitting around, couldn't you talk? Just because Sachin found Dravid, he doesn't need Ganguly now. Does Rahul like dancing in movies now? Having fun, aren't you? Come on, now! - Where's the ketchup? - In the fridge. There's nothing in the fridge. Hello? Ketchup? Have you counted this? Hello? You've not counted this share. You'll mess up the count, have you counted this? - Rahul! - Sachin! What Sachin? What if the count gets messed up? What if Kewal calls AGM? He won't, did he call? By the way, Rahul? Why did you believe we were really AGM's men? We could've lied. I have to use the bathroom. Are you AGM's men? Do you have an ID card? Were we expecting anyone? They should've told us before. Go get it. What? - Kuber! Kuber. - Who? Who's this Kuber? He took my phone. Don't know what he'll take today. Is there anyone in Delhi who's not after you? Get rid of him! Don't tell him anything about us. Bag. Bag. - Kuber? - At your service! - Hello. - Who's this young fellow? Does he also owe you money? He's my cousin from Mumbai. Dimple. - You said Friday, Kuber. - You think I'm stupid? There's some big game you're playing if you only asked for time till Friday. - What game can I play? - What are you hiding? - What am I hiding? - Speak the truth! - What would I hide? Here, check! - Checking. Here, check me! You didn't buy the James Bond kind of phone this time? How do I buy a phone with coins in my pocket? - What's behind China, man? - What's there? Are you hiding drugs? How deep are you into filth? That's it! Get out of here, you chatterbox. You've fooled around enough. Now leave. Keep your threats in Mumbai, okay? Don't ever touch me, okay? You little Tom Thumb, pack this luggage with you and leave! What? Dimple, look, he's calling you luggage. Dimple! Dimple! Dimple! Dimple? - Dimple? - You little Kuber! If I see you here before Friday, I'll make sure no one ever sees you again in Delhi! You steal phones? Petty thief! His wife gifted him that phone for his birthday. - I know. - Come on, give it back! - Give it back! - Dimple has it. - Go, get it! Get it! - Wait! Get it. Can you talk to him about my money, too? That's okay, at least got my phone back. Give it to him. I forgive you for the joke. - You take care, okay? - Get lost! Jai Hind. Get up, Dimple! This is why I tell you not to have a phone, it gets messy. What happened? What happened? Is the fight over? Shit! Hey! What's he doing up there? I thought this would add a little extra effect! Do you want him to sleep with the fishes? Untie him, you nut! I'll untie him, boss. I've been nurturing monkeys. They would have lit him up had I not seen them. Did I crack a joke? Stop staring and go help them! Jackass. - Hello. - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? - Hello? I'll whack you through the phone! Hello, AGM, Jai Hind! How are you? Did you call to ask about my health, you weasel?! Stupid network! Can you please hold on, boss?! - Hello? Can you hear me now? - Will you tell me what it is?! Boss, have I ever called to ask you anything? I believe in giving. - You know the film star Kewal? - What happened to him? Oh, you know Rahul? - Who's Rahul? - The one I sent to you for gambling. Yes, so, what happened to him? He went to the film set along with both of his cousins. And I don't think he went there to get an autograph. Who are they? I don't really know, they say they're from Mumbai. - One of them is a fat guy. - He's what? Hello? Fat, boss. He's fat! - Hello? - Fat like an elephant. He looks like a tanker, boss. It's T-E-N-K-R. Tanker. What the hell?! This stupid network! Yes? Dimple! - Hello? - Hello, it's AGM here. AGM, sir, I hope you got the money. What money? - I sent half of it. - Half, you sent half? You think I'm a donkey? You idiot! I couldn't arrange for all of the money so soon, AGM, sir. You petty actor! You better get on a flight tomorrow and give me the rest of my money. AGM, sir, I'm on a shoot right now. Also, Sachin told me to do it. Shut up, wimp! Are you coming or should I come there with a gun? No, no, AGM, sir. You don't have to come here. I'll come to you myself, just hold on a little. Come here! Call Sachin! Call him! Sachin doesn't own a phone. He doesn't own a phone? No, well, he told us we'll get brain cancer if we had one. So, call the place he's staying at. Boss, he's not at Chandu's place. I think he's staying at some hotel. Boss, didn't he take your credit card, too? Idiot! Jahnavi, Jahnavi? Love, please open the door. You'll understand my situation if you just listen to me. Jahnavi? Just like yesterday You'll say you're leaving. You will smile softly Just like you did yesterday. Jahnavi? - Just like yesterday. - Jahnavi, are you there? I will see you while I leave. This is what I'll think Just like yesterday. - Nothing? - No, man! Are you sure he's involved? He's spoken about everything else in the world besides this. I'm sure he'll say something, don't worry. We have to place a bet before the match tomorrow. We're running out of time. - Isn't there any other idea? - I do have an idea, hold on. - Hello, Mr. JC. Come sit. - Hello. Go get the car, I'm not really in the mood for this today. - Hey, Rahul! - How are you, Mr. JC? Are you not playing today either? Why? Aren't you getting your signal yet? You're not playing as well, right? Pal, I'm done for today. However, I'm saving my luck for tomorrow. - For tomorrow? Oh, yeah, yeah. - There's a match. You're playing, right? A little, I'm still thinking about it. A little? And you're thinking about it? Well, friend, if you play a little, you'll make a little. If you want to make a lot, you have to think big. Well, every person has their own specialties. Like how you're good with cards, I'm good with cricket. I've heard it on the news. You can't believe the news, can you? - I've heard that, too. - But... everything is not wrong as well. - I'll see you, JC, sir. - Listen, pal. You gave me a tip the other day and helped me win a lot. I'll give you a tip today. You'll have it made. We've made a deal with our star batsman, understood? They're going to throw the match. Don't bet on India tomorrow. Place your bet on the foreigners, the foreigners. Thank you. Thank you. He's here. - Take a drink, Rahul. What? - I don't drink. Your calculations are right. Even if you commit 100 sins, one good deed makes things okay. What sort of man is this? He gambles and lies, but he doesn't drink. Cheers. Which award did you get for drinking, donkey? Watch it! Don't talk about my size. I'm sensitive. Have you ever done anything right in your life? You keep talking about centuries all day long. You're not fit to do anything else. Why did you drag me into this? I didn't tell you to drink. - Don't drink. - You can at least say cheers. - Cheers. - And tables. Cheers. - Hello. - What is it? Love, I'm really, really sorry. I know I should've told you everything. But I didn't know how to tell you. Of course. You know to make things up, right? No, no, no, never. One minute! What do you mean by that? - Don't act innocent. - See, that's your problem. You expect me to read your mind? Listen, just cut it! Okay, fine! Cut! - Rahul, listen, I don't want to. - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. It's my fault, I'm really sorry. Okay? But I don't think we should fight like this, Jahnavi. I think we should grow up. You grow up, Rahul! Okay, okay. I will grow up. You just realized it was your fault? What happened till now? Jahnavi, I called you the other day and you didn't answer. Did you call to justify yourself or to argue? So, I'm arguing now, Jahnavi? What...? - Why do you keep calling? - Hi, Jahnavi. - Jahnavi, I'm really sorry, I don't know. - Look! - I have to wake up early tomorrow. - Love... Just give me a minute. Please let me explain. Hello? Hello? - Hello? - I'm listening! Jahnavi, I do realize that you have given me so many chances. No else would've done that. I've also tried hard to get better. It's not like that. But I'm stuck with a bet in a bad way, Jahnavi. Jahnavi, can you give me one last chance? Well, I can understand. You have to pay the import-export guy 700,000, right? I'll give it to him from my savings and we'll manage. You are so sweet, Jahnavi. And here I am, a selfish person. I bought you a phone but kept it for myself. It's okay, I don't use all its features anyway. Jahnavi, there's another problem. Now what? Don't be upset with me again. I'm being honest here. There's a bookie in Mumbai, and I have to... give him 2 million. Now, where will we get so much from? - And... - What? I borrowed some money from a client. - I mean, without telling. - You stole money from the office? - But it was lost. - What? I didn't lose it. The bookie's henchmen lost it. - Henchmen? - Well, they're not so bad. They're stuck here, too. They're my friends now. You made friends with henchmen? Well, what can I say? Don't worry, I'll sort this out in a day or two. But... please, give me one last chance. Jahnavi? Hello? Hello? Jahnavi, say something. My phone still thinks it's my birthday. How do you change a ringtone? Don't even think about it! - What did I think about? - Whatever it is you thought. - I was just... - Not even that. - But I didn't even say anything. - Good. Don't say it, then. - Really? - Really. - I thought that even you... - Yes, me too. - So? - So? Let it go! Big day tomorrow, huh? Big day. I think it looks right, it looks very hard. Last time we played here it seemed to be playing all right, and it looks pretty good this time around. A game that prints millions in blink! It's all luck, just luck Everything else fails. While someone scores a six Another scores a four. Watch as the captain really sticks close... Don't think twice. - Don't let him go! - You scoundrel! You traitor! Hey, take care! Turn around! Learn something! Turn around! Turn around! Turn around! That's it! Enough! You tried acting like Bond! Shall we? Grab the chance That's in front of you! Think about yourself Before right and wrong. Trouble hovers Over your head like a fly. Tie destiny's path to a pillar. Don't think twice Be brave! Smarty pants? You have two options. One. It's what you like. And the other is what I like. First, memorize your dialogue, then talk to me. Prasad continuing and Gibbs has been dismissed here. Hello? Hello? Yes, AGM, sir, I can't hear you. Yes, AGM, sir. Where is everyone? I got a point here. But we couldn't find the fat guy. Hello? There's no network, sir. Yes, boss? Don't be tense, boss. Look at what I do to them once I get that fat guy. No, no, boss. Yes, I looked there. No, no, you don't have to come. I'm here, right? Didn't I tell you? That phone will get you in trouble. - My goodness! - Shut up! What are you doing here? Is someone with you? Then... Quick! Over there! That fellow! Hey, Satya! Satya? These guys! Where are you hiding? You, fat boy! You can hide, but not your body. Get out! The elephant's shaking his tail. Do you want some sugarcane? Come on, come on out. What the heck? It always rings at the wrong time. Sachin, I'm hurt. - Let's go? - Let's. Come on. Great display of batting after 50 over's. South Africa, 282-5. My God! - What happened? - Nothing. You should see what happened to the one who did this. Stop joking, it's not funny. Band-Aid? Thanks. Come here! Why do you go so many times and what do you do? There was a lot of butter in the chicken yesterday, so... Hello. Hello! Do you know what's going on with the match? Why? What happened in the match? What a shot! Another century by Sachin Tendulkar. Sachin! Sachin! Sachin! Sachin! Weren't they going to lose? And that idiot made a century. I think JC fooled us big-time! It goes off to that one and comes again. - Yes! - What are you doing? You know we're supporting South Africa, right? If India wins... It's a good shot. Looking at Sachin play it seems like a career best. He's showing the South African guys how to play. The South African players don't understand how to bowl and get him out. Looking at Sachin bat, India's destiny... with three boundaries. Bowled him. Clean bowled him. What a bowler. Right up there in the block hole. It's exactly what was required. And that's a blow for India, just when they threatened to take the game away from SA. They need 27 runs to win. It seems impossible. He's going after that and he's found the boundary. Kallis offered Azahruddin the width there. You think it's free? - You fatty! Don't you have money? - Let me watch the match. Look here! Not at the match! Once again, a direct hit. Such an idiot! Get lost! India needs 17 runs to win. The match is getting interesting after every ball. Let's see who wins. In the air! That's out. Caught behind. Yes! Mohammed Azharuddin. What are these guys doing? Neither catching or throwing properly. They're not even worth playing 50 over's, 20 is good enough. They'll be world champions in 20 over's. Rapped on the pad, up goes the finger. That one nipped back into Jadeja, the decision, the umpire... India is just 10 runs away from winning. Over at the point area. Ball in! That's an official ball in the air. Could be caught. I've never wanted India to win. Aside from today. Oh, my God, he dropped it! What a sinner! What a sinner! I've always supported India, but they always lost. The only time we wanted them to lose, we lost. We were defeated with the last ball of the match. We lost one run shy of a century. But what's the point? You only get a standing ovation after a run. That's why no one remembers what the 99th run was. Hey. Isn't this a taxi? - Where's the meter? - Not here, sir. Delhi's a strange city, there's no meter in the taxi. It's cold outside, too. Let's go! One whiskey. What? What? What? - What? - What, what? What happened, Rahul? I knew something would go wrong this morning. I was on my way to place the bet. All the signals were wrong, then the accident. Fights. According to my calculations, India was to win. But I listened to him. Should've never trusted JC. Why will he help me? I made him lose horribly! I caught his bluff at the table! Why would he help me? He kept saying... Bet on the foreigners. Bet on the foreigners. Bet everything on the foreigners. I caught his bluff this time, too. And I placed the bet on India. What? You mean... we won? We won 10 rupees? Go to this address and show the serial number of the note. You'll get the money. How much did we win? Even that's written. Show me, show me. Tens, hundreds, thousands, ten thousands. One million. So much money! One minute, how did we win so much? India won anyway, but I also placed a bet on Sachin. - And he scored a century! - Yeah! Yes! Then we made history. - Hello. - Hello, this is JC. What we had on the recorder would change the fate of the cricket world. JC, I had a look at it. The match was fixed but with the South Africans. Who all are playing? JC and his captain played the whole game. They both decided which batsmen would get out on what run. Even after how many balls they would get out. No, but I told you. They decided to lose. They gave up before playing. Don't forget you have to lose the match. But you have to score more than 270. Get your money Make a run for it. Let's go, it's a joke When the tables turn. Get your money Make a run for it. Let's go, it's a joke When the tables turn. The one who gets entangled in it Is a player. The one who's stuck in it Is a player. Eleven work for it But the bounty is yours. Tell me, will you play? Don't think twice. Get your money Make a run for it. Let's go, it's a joke When the tables turn. Get your money Make a run for it. It's a joke when the tables turn. There's betrayal here And traitors outside. Why are you afraid of the mire When you're in it, too? There's just one way left to live. Weigh it soon And don't think twice! Sir, so, all the information is on this tape. On side A as well as side B, but it's muffled. If you're joking... Why would I joke, sir? To tell you the truth, please don't involve me in this, if people know, then... it won't look good. Why are you doing this? Sir, you said yourself that cricket is a religion in India. I'm a devout cricket fan, too. When cricket is on, I don't even bathe. I'll be off, sir. - Listen. - Yes, sir. If you're connected to some bookie... No, there's nothing like that, sir. Stay away then, because I'll raid places today. I'm going to arrest a lot of guys. Yes, sir. Thank you, sir. He's taken Rahul's phone, but he's not answering. He's not used to a phone. Your phone is ringing. - Hello? Hello? - Hello. Hello? Hello? Hello, who's there? It's me, Zaramud, don't you recognize me? - Zara? How are you? - Yeah. Everything's good here. What's up with you? You're mad! Sachin, run! Come again? The cops are raiding bookies everywhere! Leave the money and run! Is there another way to exit? Thanks! Let's go in. Hey, where is he? Hey, hey, hey! A guy with a red bag, just left Palika Bazaar. Hey! - Hello. - Sachin, are you okay? Zaramud said there was a raid. Nothing is okay, the cops are after me. They're at the hotel. I have to get out of here! Why don't you go to your house? I'll go there. Zaramud is with you, right? What do you mean? Is he there or not? Shit. Sachin! Open the door! Get out! Get out! Where is it? Where is the money? Seems you've been outsmarted. - How'd he get in? - Hey. You know how I got in? Once upon a time... - Shut up or I'll shoot! - I told him. Where's the money? We gambled it at the match. What? You put my money on the match? - How dare you! - But we won! - What? - We won. Where's the money? Bloody hell. That's a lot of money. - What do you mean, no money? - Not there. You think I'm an idiot? I trusted you, but you got me beat up by boys from Mumbai. I won't let you go now. What can anyone do? What can you do? Wait! How will I get back? I've told you before, I'm changing, but you won't let me! - This is not a toy gun. - Where's the money? Shut up! - You'll shoot. - No, I won't! - Give it back, give it back. - No! I told you, nothing will happen! Sorry, that was an accident. You moron! I told you it was real! - Oh, goodness! I'm dying! - I'm really sorry. What are you sorry for? Even that guy left. Give me your car keys. Give them to me! Now you'll drive my broken car? Damn you! Give me the keys! - Give them here! - My house keys are on here! Take it. - Take care. - Get off! I'm so sorry, yeah? If they can't fix my hand, I'll kill you! Moron! My hand, my hand. There's a hospital in Vasant Kunj. I know! You're great! I don't earn money by raising cattle. You need smarts to earn. Which you have. You still owe me money. And you took money from Rahul. And the Bhojpuri actor, that was my money. Then you hit my man. Now I need to kill you for that. - So, this is what will happen. - I'll tell you what happens. Look. There's more money in this bag than your loss and our debt. A lot more! But you keep it all. However, after this, we're done with you. And... Rahul, too. Yeah, that's good. It's a fair deal. I'm tired of Delhi anyway. Everyone's a thief, even the taxi doesn't have a meter. And then there's the weather... I'm annoyed with how cold Delhi is. Why don't you take my jacket with you? And have a safe trip. - But what about you? - I'm used to it. - Shall I take it? - Go ahead. - Okay? - Thank you. Thanks for everything. No problem. I should go. Have a nice flight. Pooja... Can I ask you something? It's better if you didn't. Let me try at least. Okay. Can you...? No. Come with me to Mumbai. - What will I do there? - What do you mean? There's a coffee shop. We're partners, right? The coffee shop isn't ready yet. True, but it will be ready. It's all on paper. Why don't you go there and start building the coffee shop. I'll come soon. Okay, then. I'll go. Okay. Bye. - Okay, bye. - Bye. - Hello. - Hello, Rahul, what is happening? Look, I don't have my money yet. I went to your office yesterday, but you were on a holiday. I'm coming over there now. - Will a check do? - No, no! I need to settle this now. I want my money! I'm coming there now, yes! Come over. I'm right here. God, save me from this. I've never gamble again, 100 percent. Excuse me, sir. What are you doing here? - Your suitcase was lost, right? - Yeah. - Yes. - What was in it? There was... What do you want? You never respected me, never bought anything. You only abused me. I don't want anything, leave or I'll call security. Enough, leave! How much do you need this, sir? What was in it? Just some files. If there was anything else, someone must've already got it. It's not going to be cheap. I won't give it to you so easily. What do you want? You'll have to buy a briefcase, no discount. I'll take 1,000 rupees. Seven hundred? It's not your money. Yeah, I sent it. Let's go, lover boy, done with your romance? Airport now? Shut up. You're in a hurry to go to Mumbai, is there a meeting? I'll have to cancel the shoot. I was thinking about staying back for a day or so. - The weather's good. - AGM's gone, the money's gone. Is your father going to pay for the hotel? Don't talk about my father! - Stop being such a smart-ass! - Sachin? - You're here? - Who are you? Me? Kewal Pandey! Who? - Kewal Pandey! - Kewal Pandey? Kewal Pandey. Sorry, I didn't recognize you with your new hairstyle. - You've changed! - You're staying here? We were. We're heading back to Mumbai today. - Back to Mumbai? Me too. - Yeah? Well, AGM called me. He was quite upset. He told me to pay him the rest right now. So, I've arranged it. - Could you do me a favor? - What? Can you give this bag to AGM? Please. - What's in it? - The money. - Money? - Yes. Okay, so, here's what we'll do. We have to go to Sion from Chembur, then Churchgate. We'll do all that because his problem is genuine. Mr. Kewal, this is just for you. Thank you very much. - I'll go, then, Mr. Sachin. - Bye, win a National Film Award. I'll just get going. The game isn't about the century, it's about how well you play it. But you learn this only after scoring a century. However, scoring a century is fun in of itself. Recognize the game. Recognize your worth. Friends are bigger Than winning or losing. When you're determined To do something. Play the match of life And lose or make a century. How you play is vital Because that's what really counts. We meet every day Then why think about it? Why does she always ask me? Something happened in a short while. She always keeps asking me.
