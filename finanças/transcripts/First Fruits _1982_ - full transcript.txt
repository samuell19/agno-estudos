[ Music ] My name is Leonard Dober. I'm 25 years old, and I came here to Herrnhut with my family that we might practice our Christian faith in freedom and good conscience. I dwell with the single brothers, and every night we study medicine, geography and foreign languages for perhaps someday God will allow us to bring His Gospel to others, who have not heard or believed. I learned the craft of pottery from my father, and we introduced artistic pottery to the Herrnhut community as one of the trades that is practiced here. [ Music ] We came here as refugees beginning nine years ago and built this community entirely by ourselves. Most of us are from Moravia or Bohemia, and we trace our roots back to a servant of God, John Hus, who was burned at the stake for his faith in 1 4 1 5. For over 300 years, our history has been one of persecution and suffering for our Christian beliefs. Finally, here we have found refuge. [ Music ] Two men are largely responsible for this place, which is called Herrnhut. The first is Count Zinzendorf, now 3 1, a wealthy Saxon, who was born into nobility but who gave up his life in the royal court to follow Christ-- he has given a portion of his estate for us to build on. The second is Christian David, a courageous convert, who has made at least a dozen dangerous underground trips back into the homeland, to lead out groups of families to come here and make a new life. Leonard! Hello, Tobias. The Count and David are arriving back from Copenhagen. They'll be here by nightfall and we are all going to the Saal to hear of their journey. Thank you! I’ll be there. [ Carriage sounds ] [ Singing - Music ] It's so good to be back. We had a long journey back from Copenhagen. The horses are exhausted, and so are we. The coronation was a magnificent event, and we met so many people from all over Europe. The reputation of Herrnhut has spread far and wide. People just can't understand it. And Count Zinzendorf, was awarded the highest honor of the Danish court, the "Order of the Danebrog." Thank you, David. Of course attending the coronation was a splendid and unforgettable event. But, it was not the coronation of King Christian the sixth, which has preoccupied my thoughts on the long journey back from Copenhagen. What I have not been able to get out of my mind was a conversation that I had with a black man, named Anthony. Anthony is now a servant of my own personal friend, Count Laurwig, in Copenhagen. Laurwig purchased Anthony from slavery on the Island of St. Thomas in the West Indies and since coming to Europe, Anthony has become a believer in Christ. Anthony told me about his life and his people. It is a scandal beyond description. Brothers and sisters, your fathers endured the fires of persecution because of their faith, which they, themselves, chose to hold. But, Anthony's people were sold into slavery with no choice in the matter. The slaves are treated worse than beasts of burden. They are whipped constantly. I, myself, have seen the marks. For a minor offense, the hand or the foot is cut off. They are driven unmercifully to harvest the sugar cane. . . which I must say with shame, for years has sweetened my own table. There are churches, but the churches are for whites only. Once a slave was waiting in his master's wagon during a church service, and the slave merely slipped up to the door to listen to the service. He was observed, and his ear was cut off. There is no one to tell them of the Savior's love. They are captive in body to heartless masters and captive in mind and soul to superstition, voodooism and idol worship. But the words that pierced my soul, were when Anthony spoke to me and said, "How I wish my brother, Abraham and sister, Anna could know about Jesus--" I have invited Anthony to come and visit us, so that he might be able to tell us his story and he will be here in three days. [ slow music ] (Dober thinking) "There are churches but the churches are for whites only. " "There is no one to tell them of the Savior's love. " That very night, the Count's words raced through my mind, over and over. I couldn't sleep at all. Could I go to St. Thomas and tell Anthony's brother and sister and the other slaves about the Lord Jesus Christ? The very thought was foolishness, but the burden pressed upon my soul, so heavily, I could hardly breathe. I saw so clearly that God had carefully prepared our people to minister to the slaves. We have known persecution. Our people for generations have been jailed, beaten and killed,: the objects of hatred and scorn. Maybe what we know about suffering and oppression has prepared us to reach out to the slaves with compassion. I could not resist that stirring within. ln my heart I said, God if one other person will go with me, I shall go if You so direct. [ Music ] Life went on as usual the next day in Herrnhut, except for me. . . my mind was a world away-- in St. Thomas. I eagerly awaited the time to meet and pray with my friend Tobias, at the end of that day. [ Music ] [ leaves rustling ] I’ve really looked forward to our meeting together this evening, Tobias. So have I. I need your advice. Last night, after the Count told us about the slaves, I couldn't sleep. You couldn't sleep either? Not a wink! I struggled all night. It was as if the Lord, Himself, was saying, "Tobias, you must go to Anthony's people as my messenger." I found no peace within, until I got on my knees, beside my bed, and told the Lord I’d be willing to go. [ Music ] (Dober) The words of Tobias that night were both a surprise and a comfort to me. I had expected that he might admonish me not to get carried away with my thoughts. But instead, he too had wrestled all night with the very same sense of God's calling. We committed ourselves to God and each other to bring the Gospel to the slaves on St. Thomas. But what should we do next? We did not know. We decided to begin by writing to Count Zinzendorf, expressing our thoughts and intentions. He received our letter with joy and encouraged us. He only cautioned that we take the necessary time to have all of Herrnhut join with us and give us their full blessing. I thank Count Zinzendorf for all of his help. I’ve come a long way. . . (Dober) Anthony came as Count Zinzendorf had promised, and spoke about the needs of his people. lt was at this service that the Count announced that Tobias and I had volunteered to go to Anthony's people. He arranged for us to have a private meeting with Anthony after the service. We were ready to start making our plans to leave. Anthony, these are the two young men I spoke with you about, who want to minister to your people, I thought you should speak with them alone. Anthony, Leonard and I believe God has called us to be his messengers to your people. We want you to help us prepare, Anthony. I am sorry to tell you, but what you need, I cannot give. You don't want to help us? But we thought. . . we just assumed. . . What I said was. . . what you need, I cannot give. Why aren't you happy that we want to go, Anthony? Please. . . Do not think that I am not happy that you want to go. But, it may not be as easy as you think. We never thought it would be easy, but we will face any obstacle with God's help. And, was it not you Anthony, who told us how much you wished your brother and sister could hear about Jesus? And did you not say last night, that you thought that they would believe, if only they could hear of God's love? I did say that, and my heart does ache for my people. But, the problem would not be with the slaves-- the biggest problem would be with your own kind. Why? The white plantation owners may not even allow you on the island. You will be looked on as trouble-causers. The Gospel of our Lord would give the slaves too many ideas that the white man cannot allow. The tension on the island is so great, you would only make it worse. Anthony, if God has called us, He will show us what to do. Mr. Tobias Leopold. There are few things that you need to understand: the slaves are not allowed to hold any public meetings. They work from dawn till dark. And they're not allowed off the plantations at night. And you, Mr. Leonard Dober. What if you find that the only way to bring the Gospel to the slaves. . . is by becoming one yourself. You want my help? Yes, we. . . Then let me begin by showing you the mark of a slave. [ Music ] Are you still sure you want to go? [ Music ] [ Water splashing ] [ Water splashing ] I think it's unwise for you to go at this time. You must realize that these plantation owners view their slaves as a business investment. They will not tolerate your mixing with the blacks. They will probably run you off as soon as you arrive. It is very important for them to keep their slaves resigned to their fate, to grind to pieces-- every glimmer of hope they might have for a better life. They will be afraid of you. Afraid that you will give aspirations to the blacks that will, let us say, be bad for business. I am really surprised, Christian David, to hear that kind of reasoning coming from you. (Dober) Anthony was not the only one to raise grave doubts about the advisability of our plans. Everyone in Herrnhut seemed to have reasons why we should reconsider-- even those that we thought would support us-- like Christian David. I became frustrated. Yes, even angry. I was so sure, in my heart, that it was God's call for Tobias and me to go. But why couldn't the others see that? [ Music ] So we waited. The months passed. We waited through the winter, spring came and still no action. So, we appealed to Count Zinzendorf for a decision. He agreed and called a special meeting with the council. It has been almost a year since Tobias and Leonard first submitted their request to us to go to the West Indies to preach the Gospel. They have waited patiently for our decision, but we have not been able to reach any unanimity on this question. It is time now, that we recommend to the congregation a specific course of action, one way or the other. Leonard and I are eager to begin. We feel now, even more sure that God has called us to this work. We wait only for the approval and blessing of this congregation. I still say no. Your youthful exuberance is quite admirable but after a few years of maturity, you will soon realize that you cannot rush after every ill-conceived adventure and expect to receive the divine approval and the blessing of this congregation. Brother Linner, was not David but a youth, when he went out to meet Goliath? Did you not suspect me of youthful ambition when I established the single sisters last year, when I was not yet fifteen? When I was selected Chief Eldress among the women, earlier this year, you, and Count Zinzendorf too, if I recall correctly, again said, "Anna Nitschmann, you're too young, be patient. " Why do you always think that just because a young person is prepared to follow God in a step of faith, that it is vain ambition. Beside, they're not really that young. Well, look. . . they're grown men. St. Thomas is another world. It's a totally different climate. They have diseases there of which the two of you've never heard. Deadly diseases, that foreigners can easily catch. And furthermore, if God wants a ministry to the slaves at this time, would He not move among the established churches to accomplish it? Christian David, we cannot permit what happens in the established church be the index of God's will for us. ln every age, has not God had to move some to step ahead and follow the leading of the Holy Spirit? Even the earliest New Testament Church had to break through their own blindness to see that the Gospel was for the Gentiles, as well as the Jews. When our forefather, Comenius, led his decimated remnant of believers over the mountains from Moravia, he stopped and pled in prayer that God would preserve a hidden seed to glorify His name. Are not we all in this room and in this village the answer to that prayer? We are that hidden seed. But a seed has no value until it is planted in the ground to produce fruit. We are ready to be planted in a portion of the Lord's vineyard. Our most agonizing test came when we talked alone with Anthony. We realized then, that if we are to go and preach to the slaves, the only way that we may be able to do so, is if we are willing to become slaves ourselves. But is even that so unreasonable? Did not our Lord Jesus leave the Father's side and take upon Himself, the form of a servant and became obedient unto death? But, God raised Him up-- and we know that there is nothing that can separate us from the love of God. If need be, we are willing to become slaves because we know that Christ will always be with us. My brothers, I’ve been your teacher but you have so much to teach me. We have prayed, thought, talked, argued about this for months. Can we submit this decision to the drawing of lots and agree to be bound, thereby. I think that is best. Yes. And, I agree. We are willing. . . then that is what we shall do. Let us take it to the Savior in prayer. [ Music ] (Dober) Thus, we agreed to reach a decision through the drawing of lots, as was done at times in the Old and New Testament, such as in the first chapter of Acts when the lot was used to select a replacement for Judas. We do this acknowledging that we do not have not sufficient wisdom to know for sure the mind of the Lord, and we agree to accept and be bound by the results of the lot. The lot box has two compartments, each containing three different Scripture references-- one indicating "yea", one "nay" and one "wait". [ Music ] "Tarry here until we come to you." "Let the lad go, for the Lord is with him." [ Singing - Music ] (Dober) I have a few days work to finish up, before I could leave. I’ve received the most wonderful news-- David Nitschmann offered to go with me to St. Thomas for a short time, to help me get started. The elders gave complete approval. . . thank the Lord, I will not have to go alone. [ Singing - Music ] And so we departed and headed for Copenhagen, where we would seek a ship to St. Tomas. The Count gave us a ride as far as Balsom, as he was on his way to Dresden to deal with some legal problems concerning our community. His mind seemed more on us and our mission. And on the way, he summed up the guidance he had given to us over the past months. Live among the people, as one of them. Earn your own keep. You are there to serve. And, don't expect to convert masses of people, all at once. The Lord already knows whose hearts He has prepared to believe. Your job is to find them. Even if they are few in number. These will be the precious "first fruits". [ Music ] (Dober) The journey to Copenhagen was about 300 miles and we were eager to get there as fast as possible. Everyone we met along the way, that we told of our plans, thought we were foolish and could not understand. Many advised us to go back home. Only the Countess von Stollberg, Count Zinzendorf's friend, at Wernigrode, gave us encouragement. "Venture all for Christ, " she said. "He is worthy of giving even your life for the Gospel. " [ Music ] [ Seagulls squawking ] [ Crewmen conversing ] We have boarded a Dutch ship for passage to St. Thomas, but only after some discouraging events. For when we arrived in Copenhagen, the Danish West India Company, upon learning the purpose of our voyage, absolutely refused to allow us passage. But David, actually appealed directly to the Queen, who agreed to meet us. She and Princess Charlotte Amalie, listened to our plans with great interest. While in Copenhagen, we were able to find Anthony at Count Laurwig's house. He gave us a letter of introduction to his sister and brother, Anna and Abraham. Also, the Queen and the Princess Amalie gave us money, some medicine and even a Dutch Bible. And booked passage for us on this ship. The crew was hostile to us, at first. They derived great pleasure mocking and taunting us. But, gradually we seemed to gain their respect. They say our plans are utter foolishness. They warn we will die of malaria and that both blacks and whites will hate us. But this long voyage has served to strengthen our hearts, and we eagerly look forward to our arrival to begin our work, even though we do not know anyone in St. Thomas, or have any idea of what will await us there. [ Music ] [ Music ] The trip to St. Thomas normally took about six weeks, but our voyage has taken nearly three months. A series of storms drove us way off course, then we endured a period of stillness when there wasn't enough wind. But. . . St. Thomas is finally in view. We had begun to wonder if this day would ever come. I thought David and I would be leaping for joy upon sight of our destination. But, strangely, as soon as we saw the land, our stomachs turned heavy. Grave doubts came rushing in. Instead of enthusiasm, we felt apprehension. The Daily Text for the day, read.: "The Lord of hosts mustereth the hosts of the battle. " [ Music ] [ Music ] [ Slaves singing ] [ Music ] St. Thomas was the most beautiful place I had ever seen. lt was a different world, with a different way of life. But it didn't take long for us to come face-to-face with the horrible conditions that Anthony had spoken about. (Slave master) Hurry up you swine! You don't finish that field this evening, you don't eat. Ahh! Arr!. . . (Dober) If I was unsure about how to reach the slaves, I was even more at a loss as to how to reach the Masters. [ Music ] After we were given temporary lodging by a planter, we sought to locate Anthony's brother Abraham and his sister Anna. (Dober) Do you know Abraham? Abraham? Abraham? (Dober) Abraham? Do you know Abraham? Abraham? Are you Abraham? Hello, Abraham! (David) And, you are Anna? You new to this island. Yes, we just came from Europe. We came to be your friends. Anthony, your brother, is our friend. He gave us this letter and asked me to read it to you. You know Anthony? Yes, he came to the place where we live. He told us about you and we have come to bring you a wonderful message about a man named Jesus, who wants to be your friend, too. Been a long, long time since I seen Anthony. He thinks about you every day. Let me read you his letter. My dear brother and sister, Abraham and Anna. How glad I am to be able to talk to you through words on paper. The men who bring you this letter are David and Leonard. Don't be afraid. They will not hurt you. They have come to tell you about a story. . . (Dober) They received us kindly and recognized that the letter was indeed from Anthony, although they were very cautious. We could tell immediately that it would take much time and patience to explain about the Savior's love, but at least we had found these dear people, whom we had come so far to meet. [ Music ] The life of the slaves was one of monotonous drudgery, working long hours in the sugarcane fields. Their lives were never their own and they had no hope of ever aspiring to anything better. [ Music ] On those few occasions when they had time off, we would visit the slaves and tell them about the Savior's love and death on the cross. We did this for weeks but just did not seem to be getting through. They couldn't understand why we were telling them about the white man's God, when they were not even allowed near the white man's churches. [ Music ] Here come those white men that snoop around the village at night. Don't worry about them. They are harmless. They just want us to pray to their God. No white man is harmless. Did you ever meet a white man that didn't carry a whip, or have someone else carry it for him. The master doesn't like them. He warned us-- don't listen to them. You still don't understand the white man do you? This is another one of their tricks. They know we hear the drums from St. John's, so they sent two of their new boys to be nice. But they are only here to find out if we are making any plans at night. Just let them say their piece and they'll be on their way. Good day to you men! May we share our water with you? Why white man here? We came across the ocean to tell you about God's son. His name is Jesus and He's done many things. . . What color, this Jesus? I don't really know, you see, He lived long ago before we were born, but He was probably darker than we and lighter than you. But His love is for everyone. He died for our sins. He offers forgiveness, full forgiveness, and He brings us back to the God, Who made us all. You're new here, white-man. Nothing that happens on this island should be forgiven by the God or by me or by anyone. Thomas, watch your tongue or you might have it cut out of your big mouth. I tell you what, white man. You tell your God, or Jesus, to come live with us under the masters for a while, then we will begin to listen to what He has to say about love and forgiveness. Thomas. . . Thomas, He has come and He lived as a servant in another land, but He has sent us to you to be your servants. Oh-- He sent you to be our servants. Yes. You hear that-- they come to be our servants. [ Laughing ] [ Music ] [ Music ] (Dober) How quickly the time arrived for David to sail back home. How it pained me to see him have to leave. One strong consolation was the little orphan boy, Oby, who has become like my shadow. He has no home. His parents are dead. But he is a very bright and inquisitive child. [ Music ] Now I am left alone to share the Gospel. With David gone, I feel even more inadequate. And I know for certain that words alone are not sufficient. The counsel of count Zinzendorf keeps coming back to me. First you must live among the people as one of them and let the Holy Spirit show you the hearts, He has already prepared. What I found most difficult was tending to those stricken with malaria and the fever. The medicine that I brought, through the kindness of Princess Charlotte Amalie, helped some, but most of them died. At least I was able to give them some small comfort. I didn't know it, but helping the sick was really the most important thing I could do. The slaves understood this part of the Gospel first. [ Slaves moaning with illness ] [ Music ] [ horse galloping ] Dober! Leonard Dober-- Come out here! Come over here! You are going too far, you fool. You will catch that fever and you'll be dead in a week. I could get sick and die anywhere. I came to serve these people. Dober, they are animals. You have no business here. You can only cause trouble. I am here with the permission of the governor's office. . . You are coming with me. Why must I leave? Listen, Dober, are you deaf? Haven't you heard the drums, night after night? Don't you hear the trouble they convey? Things will get rather unpleasant around here. The slaves on St. John's have staged a revolt. They killed some whites. Three hundred of them black swine, killed themselves, rather than face the punishment they justly deserved. Troops had to be brought in from Martinique to squash them. For now, all whites will have to be isolated and protected, until we can get arms and reinforcements in here in case the slaves here get any ideas. Then, I think it is more important than ever that I stay right here. . . You are coming with me! No. Then, I shall report your refusal to the authorities. [ Music ] [ Music ] (Dober) Things did get worse for the slaves too; their slightest mistake brought about the most severe and cruel punishment from the Masters. One problem after another deepened my frustration. For I was having no success at all, when it came to finding clay to make my pottery and earn my living. Even though Oby and I had searched the entire island. I was beginning to think, that my ministry here might be a total failure. But in spite of these doubts, I kept praying. Praying that the Holy Spirit would work through me and God's word. [ Ocean wave sounds ] Mister Dober, I want to be a follower of Jesus and love God like you do. You do, Oby! Yes. Thank God for you, Oby, my precious little friend. Do you really believe that Jesus is God's Son and that He died for our sins? Yes, and like you told me, He didn't stay dead but lives with God now, and sees me and prays for me. You do believe! Little did I ever imagine that God would send me a child to be the first of the first fruits. First-fruits? Yes-- but not the last. We will pray together everyday, that the others would believe. Someday, maybe enough will believe, so we'll have a church with a big bell. And you can ring it everyday, so the people will know when to come to church. Oby, don't know how to ring bell. You will! You will! [ Music ] My heart was filled with joy for Oby. But at the same time, I felt my body growing weak, and then more weak. And then for days, I was confined to my bed. [ Coughing ] Mister Dober. . . please Mister Dober, it's me, Anna. . . please Mister Dober. Take this. Take this Mister Dober. It'll help you to feel better. This bush tea, it good for you. That's right, Mister Dober. Just take some bush tea. It will help you get over the fever, Mr. Dober. We'll come back in a little while. Please, Mr. Dober's God. Don't let Mr. Dober die. Help Mr. Dober get over fever. Mr. Dober, it's almost Christmas. Three more days and it's Christmas. I pray to the Lord that you be better by Christmas. Oh God, is this the hour that you have chosen to take me from this life? If so, dear Savior, I thank you for letting me come here and for giving me at least one believer. My Father, I pray that You will send others from Herrnhut to finish my work. [ Music ] Word of my illness spread across the plantation, and after their days work, the slaves showed great concern for my well being. Even though I had tended others with the fever, I had no idea of how utterly devastating the dread sickness could be. I was certain God was calling me home. But praise His name,: He used the compassion and kindness of this beaten, tired, and overworked people to bring me back to health. Christmas morning arrived and on that day, I had an unforgettable visit from Anna, Abraham, Gerd and Oby. You're looking better every day, Mr. Dober. Thank you, I feel better. Mr. Dober, this is the Christmas day you told us about. Yes. It will be cold, back in Herrnhut and there'll be snow on the ground. What snow, Mr. Dober? I’ll have to think how to explain that, Oby. Mr. Dober, I have some good news for you. Abraham, Gerd and me-- we will follow Jesus with you and Oby. Mr. Dober, I prayed to God, I asked His forgiveness because Jesus died for my sins, like you tell us. I know He hears. I know because I love you, Mr. Dober. Gerd no love any white man. Gerd hate, want to kill every white man he ever met. But you Mr. Dober. . . it's different. I carve this for you, Mr. Dober, for Christmas-- it's Jesus when He was baby. Thank you. Mister Dober, you must tell us again everything about Christmas. You must tell us again everything about Jesus. Our mighty Savior, thank you for opening the hearts of these beautiful people. There is joy in Heaven because of you and there will be joy in Herrnhut, when they hear. Mister Dober, I bring you Christmas gift, too. You don't need to find bell when you have a church. Oby don't need to ring bell to call people. We can use this to call the people, Mr. Dober. hoot You're right, that's what we'll use. hoot [ fire crackling ] [ fire crackling ] [ night creatures and insect sounds ] So, dear friends at Herrnhut, because I could find no clay suitable for pottery, I have found a job as a night watchman, which provides enough for my needs. I have time to meet with our little group of believers, each evening, before my watch begins. These new Christians are already far more effective than I am, in spreading the good news among the other slaves. Praise God with me that our prayers are being answered. While I am now so very encouraged, I must admit, that at the same time, I feel desperately lonely. How I miss you people at home. How I wish I could be with you right now and sing the songs of praise for this day. I heard a ship was arriving from Copenhagen this week, so I am writing this letter to send to you on its return voyage. [night creatures and insect sounds] Leonard? ls that you Leonard? Yes, it's me! It's me, Leonard! Tobias. . . my dear brother, Tobias. Am I dreaming. ls this really you? It's really me, Leonard. We arrived in Tappus Bay this afternoon and I hiked down here to find you, right away. Leonard, 1 8 of us have come from Herrnhut. Eighteen! ! Some of us will be settling on the neighboring island of St. Croix to begin work there. This is more than I can absorb. I am overwhelmed. Well, Leonard. . . there is more news you must hear, right away. What is it? Brother Linner, died last winter-- and you have been elected Chief Elder and are to return on the ship that carried us here to take up your duties. No, I can't leave. I am not fit to be Chief Elder, besides my work here has really just begun! I know how you feel, Leonard. But Leonard, for us back at Herrnhut your coming here with David, was just the beginning. Matthew Stack and Christian David have already gone to Greenland and have begun work there. Eighteen of us are here to follow in your trail. And, Leonard, the single brothers and the single sisters and the married couples, are all back at Herrnhut preparing to go forth to every continent. Your going forth, Leonard, gave expression to the years of prayer and searching for God's will for us. After you left, we learned about more and more places of desperate need. But there was no longer that doubt and that hesitation. Now there is eagerness. You opened the door, Leonard-- now you are needed. You are called back to help prepare our people to go forth, out into all the world, as the Savior commanded. I am filled with joy, Tobias. I was torn. Yes, I missed Herrnhut so much, but I found the call to leave here was even more difficult than the call to come. As I reflected, I realized that I had by now, become a part of this place. But I had submitted to my brethren in making my decision to come here. I would now submit to their decision and call for me to return. Arrangements were made for Oby to go home with me, redeemed and free. The first fruits of our mission. Within nine months, nine of the 1 8 who came with Tobias died, Tobias Leopold, himself, died within two years. But, their sacrifice prompted more and more from Herrnhut to volunteer for service. During the next 25 years of my life, I witnessed over 200 of our people go out as missionaries to fields of service, touching every continent. The influence of our small group of Moravian refugees became extraordinary. Our 2 4-hour a day prayer chain continued year after year, beseeching God that believers of all denominations and in all generations, will go forth proclaiming our Lamb has conquered. Let us follow Him.
