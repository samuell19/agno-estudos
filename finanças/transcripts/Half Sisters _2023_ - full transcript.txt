"The kind of small miracle that is always possible when we take charge of the first two seconds. They saw her for who she truly was." Hello. Hum... I have a Black boyfriend, uh, and now my dad is threatening to cut me off. I don't know what to do. Your father can take away material goods. But he can't take away... ...the essence... ...of you. Mm-hmm. If he wants to cut you off, cut him off first. - Yeah. - Yes. That's right. Never be afraid to love. That's what I did when my grandmother tried to get in between me and my love... ...my wife... ...Deonna. And I have never... ...looked back. I'll be talking about this in my newest book... ...Loving Black... ...A Sapphic Romance, dedicated to my wife, obviously. Thank you. If you're so good at loving Black, then why did your wife, my sister, leave you, Isabel? Carl, what are you doing here? Not recently, either. Three years ago. Carl, I don't think this is the place. - I think you need to leave. - -She told me what you did. About your sister. Oh, shit. Yeah. Okay. Yeah. No, no. That's fair. Yeah. Okay. Well? The book deal's off. They said they can't have whatever you've got going on going on. They can't. I worked so hard on that book. - My reputation-- - Isabel, they can't publish you. - The bad press alone. Not recently, either. Plus, you lied about being married. - Three years ago. - Who does that? Also, they want their advance back. Seven hundred thousand dollars? That money's gone. Well, you better get it. No, Julie, you better get it. You're my agent. I'm not getting that money for you, Isabel. Also, I'm not your agent. Not anymore. - If you're so good at loving Black, then why did your wife, my sister, leave you, Isabel? ...then why did your wife, my sister, leave you, Isabel? Carl, what are you doing here? Not recently, either. - Three years ago. - -Carl, I don't think this is the place. - I think you need to leave. - -She told me what you did. About your sister. "Dear Isabel, if you're reading this, I'm dead." Okay, ladies, we're going to do our breathing exercise. You know the drill. Inhale on three. Exhale on three. Okay? So I want you to inhale. One, two, three. Exhale. One, two, three. One more time. Inhale. One, two, three. Exhale. One, two, three. And just release any tension that you have of the day. And when you're ready, you can open your eyes and come back. Alright. I want, I want to start off with something that you said in the last session, Leeza. What do you mean by "unlovable"? After you keep getting rejected, you take what you can get. Even if it's not love, love. For Doctor Garcia. Ladies, I think we're going to postpone this today. Uh, um, could you take them back to their bunks, please? Uh, Leeza? Leeza, can you-- Um, hey. Uh, will you follow me for a second? Amber, all you social workers are the same. Rude. Every criminal has a sob story. Evans is no different. Hell, she's probably worse. -Didn't she attack a guard last year? -Yeah, she did. Those extenuating circumstances. Her grandmother-- Are you good, Evans? Hey, even the judge thought solitary was enough. -She didn't extend her sentence. -What's your point? My point is, I've been counseling Leeza for a while now, and she's a model prisoner. -Oh! -She does what she's told. Uh, she keeps to herself. You know, her grandmother was the one thing that was a trigger. Well, and her sister, I guess. Half sister. You got something to say, Evans? If what you're saying is true, if... ...why would I send her to some private funeral? In my opinion, if Leeza buries her grandmother literally, it can help her bury her metaphorically. And then she can confront her sister, -and-- -Okay, I get it. I get it. I get it. Evans, just hold it right there. Fine. She can go. Ah, ah, ah, I'm sending Resovsky with her. Hal, she's not a flight risk. Put a monitor on her. Look, it's just supposed to be the sisters. Half sisters. Don't get too excited, Evans. It's one day. Besides... - I'm missing you already, baby girl. Yeah. Okay. Okay. I've got her from here, thanks. Thank you. Isabel's still going to be there. How do you feel about that? I don't want to talk about it. Baby girl... ...get in this car. -Can we get the hell out of here, please? -Yeah. Bye. See you later! See you later! Thanks for letting RJ pick me up. - I had taken myself, but my weekend's booked. I don't trust that guy, but he'll get you where you need to go. Please tell me he's not selling anymore. Yeah, I think he stopped. What is that? -Are you-- -It's about the-- You know? No, you said you stopped. I ain't stopped making money. There's other ways to make money. You're gonna end up exactly where I am. We're supposed to be working on ourselves for each other. That, that just doesn't mean anything? -I'm working to keep the lights on. -Right. Yeah. You wouldn't know anything about that, would you? Listen, no matter what happens this weekend... ...you are not who your grandma says you were. Don't let the cabin win. Okay? I know it's just supposed to be me and Isabel, - but could you please come with me? I don't know if I can face Isabel alone. Baby girl, I may be a white boy... ...but I ain't "remote farmhouse in the middle of nowhere" white boy. Nah. You go in there and handle your shit. I'll be back to get you in a couple of hours. You'll be alright. -Alright. -Hey. Show me. I want to talk to Daddy! Keep playing. I want you to be the best. -I want to talk to Daddy. -Leeza, please-- Will you shut her up? -I cannot hear Isabel playing. -I'm trying. Leeza, baby, Daddy can't talk to us right now. -If you just-- -Daddy! -It's Leeza! Daddy! -That's it! If you're not going to do anything about it, -then I will! -She-- no! Mother! I had it with you. Get in there and learn your lesson! Please. Not again. Not to my little girl. Obviously, I didn't do it enough. Grandmother... ...she's my sister. She's your half sister. You really are a monster... ...Mother. Come on. Mom. -Mama. -No, Mom. No, Is-- Isabel. - No, no-- - Wake up, Mama. Wake up! Mommy! You sure let this place go, huh, Grandma? You want to go back to the crawl space? Turn off that ignorant noise. Leeza. Isabel. Those her ashes? Yeah. Well, let's get this over with. Someone's in a rush to get back to prison. I hate this lake. Made me afraid of water. Never did learn to swim. Isabel, Leeza, quit that sniffling. Your mother's gone... ...you're going to have to live with that. This world is a cruel, cruel place. Places some people at the top... ...and others... ...at the bottom. If you know your role... ...you got a good chance. With your mother gone, it's up to me to teach it to you. First one back to the house gets a prize. Go! Help! I can't swim! - I said, "Go!" - Izzy! Grandma! She would fucking know. I am just your f-- I'm just here. Can you just get over yourself, please? This woman raised us. Be respectful. Something I wrote to honor the woman who raised us. "Charlotte Lindman... ...wasn't a perfect woman... No! Open. Please. No, Grandma. No. - What lesson did you learn? - No. Open! ...but she did her best -in raising her two--" -Don't-- stop. Just stop! Leeza! Why would you do that? - I'm sorry. - What the fuck? You're a mess, you know that? -Leeza-- -What do you want? This came with the urn she sent me. I haven't watched it yet. I thought might-- we might be able to watch it together. I gave it up. You know forced prison sobriety doesn't count. We supposed to be watching something. If you're watching this... ...then I'm dead already. I lived my life how I wanted to. And now I'm floating in the lake... ...by my cabin. I see you followed my instructions... ...since I gave them to Isabel. Leeza would have just messed them up. There's something else you should know. I died worth eight hundred and ninety-eight thousand eight hundred and ninety-three dollars and seventy-six cents. I scrimped and saved to get that money. And I'm not just gonna let it be used... ...for drugs. I hid a cashier's check somewhere in the cabin. The first one to find it gets to keep it. And no cheating... ...for once in your life. No cheating. God. I can't do this again. -Can I borrow your phone? -What? I just want to call RJ. Please. My God, you can have the money. I'm leaving. Here. -Thank you. -Yeah. Can I have one of those too? Sure. The hell? It's RJ. My phone is probably dead. You know what to do. Hey, RJ, babe, can you come pick me up? I thought I could handle this, but I... If you're looking for Charlotte Lindman, she's dead. -See? Back where it belongs. -Mm. It's weird. There's some guys outside. And what are you gonna do if you find the money? I've got expenses. Unlike you, my room and board isn't provided by the state, so. Shut the fucking-- Bitch! I'm sorry. No, no. See? No fucking self-control. That's why you're in prison now. You're such a fucking-- Childhood bedroom? Really? Fucking dramatic. Why can't you just grow the fuck up? Hey, that's mine! - What the heck? -No, it isn't. -Yes, it is. -Give it back. Give it back. -Give it to me. No! -Give it back! -What in the hell is going on in here? Leeza tried to steal Mom's pearl necklace. She was my mom too. -What-- -Give me. L-- Look at you. All I see is your father. Get over here. Now! Get over here. Get in here right now. You know the routine. Go on. You act like an animal, you're gonna get treated like an animal. -Please, no! -Get in. -Please, no-- -Now! Just stop talking to me. - You're okay, Isabel? - Yes, Grandmother. I'm fine. Let's get you some ice cream. That girl's gonna be the death of me. I'm leaving. And I think your skeezy-ass boyfriend abandoned you. It's not a fucking fashion show. I couldn't find the money. I'm leaving before the roads close. What? I, I can't stay here. Can you take me back at least? I'm-- Yeah. After you pulled that stunt, you're lucky I woke you up. You know what? Maybe I do want to look for the money after all. It would be nice to leave prison with the little nest egg. Get your coat. Congrats on your new book, by the way. Thanks. How's Deonna feel about it? I don't know. We are not together anymore, so. Hmm. Hmm? What do you mean, "Hmm"? You know you're the reason she left, right? How, how am I the reason? Because you broke into my apartment. -Are you serious? -Yes, I'm serious. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. What the hell? I just bought these four. Isabel. Isabel. Back up! I have the police on speed dial. Run! Hurry up! Isabel, hurry up! Damn cigarettes. Hurry up! What is going on? -Who are those people? -I don't know. Did you get the police? No. One of them knocked my phone out of my hand. -What about your phone? -We can't have phones in prison. - What are we gonna do? - Oh, get them. Get them! Get the lights. Hello, ladies. -Who wants to play? -Fuck off! We'd hate to damage this nice, little cabin of yours. But if you don't come out, we'll have to come in. Leave us alone! Not until we get what we came for. What are we gonna do? Oh, my G-- in Grandma's old room. -The old ro-- -The old rotary phone! -Yes! -Yeah. Go! I can handle this. You stay here in case one of those thugs gets in. -We need to stick together. -I'm gonna find a jack. Hurry up. -Did you find it? -Not yet. It's here. It's here. It's here. - Isabel, help! - Leeza! Leez. Leeza. Leeza! Where's the money? What the fuck is he doing here? How do you know about the money? I can't believe he made that jump. God, it's not that hard. Come on. Fuck. What about the phone? Now we have no way of getting help, so. I mean, why not? -Won't the police come if you tamper with-- -Don't ask again. I'm not going to do it. Okay. I mean, it makes zero sense. Fuck. I need a cigarette. They wanted the money. They what? Whoever is out there, they said they wanted the money. They asked for it. But that-- h-- how did they find out about it? We only found out about it tonight. Only Grandmother knew. Oh, my God. Fuck you, old lady! She did this. This is-- this is a game. This is one of her games. She, she told us about the money, but she also told some goddamn hillbilly killers. It's one of her fucked-up life lessons from beyond the grave. That money is min-- Our inheritance. They can't just-- Leeza, take off the ankle monitor. -The police will come. We can split the money! -I told you not to ask again. Do you-- do you want to die? Do you want to be killed by some toothless, inbred hicks? Fine. Fine. Why are you such a bitch to me? I'm a bitch? I saved your life. -You should be thanking me! -You are the reas-- What? Are you seriously thinking about giving up and handing over the money? -Maybe. It's just money. -"It's just money." -What do you mean? You're the sel-- selfish-- -Calm down. Look. Why the barn? Do you remember my old CB radio? The one I used to call my dad on? The one Grandma took? Well, it's in there. -And I bet it still works. -You bet? You're willing to get stabbed to death by some maniacs over a hunch? Do you... Do you really think grandmother set this up? Obviously. I mean, don't you remember why you have been... ...left? Deonna. My first girlfriend. Grandmother didn't care for that. I remember being out in the woods. Cold. And those stupid buckets. "I want you to find mushrooms, as many as you can. The one with the most wins. Let the best girl win." And what lesson was she trying to teach anyway? I didn't care. They all ended the same for me. That's the one time I remember winning. But Grandma still-- All she had to say after that was, "Lesson learned." - Shh. - Izzy. Leeza, go back to bed. Where are you going? My dad's sister, okay? She said I can stay with her. Take me with you. Maybe I could call my dad. -I've been trying to contact him, but he doesn't answer. -Shh. -I think that-- -Leeza! Mom lied. Your dad was never a truck driver. He was just a deadbeat that didn't care about you. Grandmother told me so. I'm sorry. I can't stay here and don't have anywhere else to go. You're tough. You're gonna be alright. Don't leave me here. Bye, Leeza. Isabel, please. Isabel. Isabel. You left me with Grandma, knowing that she was... No, it doesn't matter. The point is that nothing is beyond Grandma when it comes to teaching a lesson. I-- I couldn't-- Let's go. I refuse to be blamed for anything-- Look, Isabel, be quiet. Be quiet. I'm refusing to believe you -because you were always making things up-- -Shut up-- -You were! Like imaginary fucking trucker dad-- -Be quiet! Well, you were. And grandmother, she took care of you. Of us! You should be grateful, to be honest. I mean, I just-- Fuck-- Run! Shit-- Come on! Get in! Get that! Oh, fuck! - My God. - Spider. -Where's the radio? -So... I don't know. What the fuck? Ouch. Grandma was a doomsday prepper? Here. -I guess so. -Oh! Okay. I'm gonna stay over here and look. You want to look in that corner? - What? - Go look in the corner. -Really? -Just-- Let me check. Oh, I just... Oh, fuck. -Oh. -Leeza, I found it. -What's going on? -What? What is it? -Yeah. -Okay. Okay. Hello. Hello. Please help us. Um, hello? Over? I'm-- It's Isabel Lindman. I'm at eleven, five, seventy-three North Cherry Road. I'm with my sister. Eleven, five, seventy-three. Is this a joke? 'Cause I'm not s'posed to be on my daddy's radio, -I'm not s'posed-- -No, no. -Is he tryna teach me a lesson? -Oh, fuck! No! This-- No! This is not a joke, kid. Please go get your dad. O-- okay. BRB. -No. -Oh, fuck! -No. -Fuck! -This was a waste of fucking time. -You don't know-- -Don't know what? -You don't know that he didn't remember. Kids don't remember shit, this was a fucking stupid idea. You know what? You don't fucking-- -Oww! Get off! -Give me that! You don't fucking-- Fuck! I fucking swear, if you do that -one more time-- -Oh, you swear what? You'll hurt me? Fucking kill me? -I wouldn't be surprised if you fucking try-- -You know what? Since we might die tonight, let's get some shit out in the open. I am tired of you treating me like shit, like I am less than you. -God. -Oh, what? You're not going to admit it? You can think whatever the fuck you want. I never fucking said that. And I'm not the one with a fucking ankle monitor-- You, you are the worst sister! Fuck off! I can't take it off. If I take it off, it makes me a real criminal and I am not. I'm not. RJ. -Isabel, do you see them? -No. Skeezy fucking boyfriend to the rescue. Got me coming out here in the boondocks, - in the middle-- - Wait-- run! Run, run. Run, RJ! Is he important to you? Huh? - No! - Money. In ten minutes. -Or he dies. -Leeza. - No. No! - Leeza! No! We're gonna give up Grandmother's money for that slimeball? He's a fucking loser. -Do you hear how he fucking talks to you? -I know. I know. But he is the only person who's ever been there for me? I need him. Fine. Fine. Let's split up. Fuck. It's not here! There is nothing here! Time's up, ladies! Fuck. Please help me. Stop! Let him go! -I'll fucking kill you! -Come on. Oh, my God. My God, no! -Leeza, get up. -My God, no. Get up! -Leeza, get up! -Oh, my God. -Everyone was right about me. -Oh, fuck! Get up. We don't have time for your pity party. I said, "Get up." Okay? RJ's dead. Okay? But we're not. He wouldn't want you to die too. Come on! -You don't fucking care. You don't care! -Come on! You left me here. I stayed with Grandma for so long because I was scared. I was scared I couldn't make it on my own, and I was-- I was scared you'd leave me again. And I was right. You're my sister. Okay? You're a Lindman. I-- now get the fuck up, Leeza! Come on. What are we gonna fucking do? Honestly... ...I've got nothing. Fuck. Fuck. Fuck. I have an idea. Will you trust me? Stop. Wait. I have the money. I'm coming out. Where's your sister? Well, you just killed her boyfriend, so maybe give her a minute. -If I give you this, will you let us go? -The money first. -What is this? -Now, Leeza! You killed RJ! You killed RJ! I give up! Isabel, stop! Leeza, stop! Leeza. - It's over! - Please, Isabel! Izzy! Stop! I'm sorry. What the fuck. I'm sorry. What the fuck? So you're the boyfriend, huh? Thanks for setting this up. Ms. Lindman. I'm, I'm Amber Garcia, Leeza's counselor. My hope with this meeting today is that it'll help Leeza deal with some things that we've been working on. She says she'll talk to you, but she will remove herself if the situation becomes overwhelming. -How are you-- -RJ Said you wanted to see me. Right to the chase. Okay. As soon as your sister gets here. - Isabel is coming? - She is coming. - I can't. I can't-- - Leeza, please. Well, we can always count on Leeza to disappoint my grandmother. Fucking bitch! Get the fuck out of here! - Leeza! - Get out! Well, this was clearly a mistake. Isabel, you shouldn't have-- But she's clearly not sorry enough for her crime, Grandmother. Izzy, she's your sister. Half sister. Remember? You wanna help Leeza? You wanna make some money? I'm gonna need you to do some things for me. I'm dying. But I want to do one right thing for my girls before I go. - Sorry. - -I need people who love my girls... - ...people that will go through anything to help them. Amber. Please. I need your help. Leeza needs your help. -Okay. -Okay. -Hey. -What? That's what you got. Since you don't know Isabel that well... ...I can suggest someone that loved her at one time. But... ...tell her that I'm sorry. I was wrong. Tell her Isabel needs her. If you're watching this, then... ...I'm dead already. It doesn't matter. I lived my life how I wanted to. And now I'm floating in the lake by my cabin. After I'm gone, I want you to drop off my remains and funeral instructions to Isabel. An invite to my funeral should be enough for Leeza, but you might have to be creative in getting her there. Watch. Wait. Until they're in the cabin alone. Don't let them leave until they learn... ...to work together. What? We thought we were going to die! Why would she do this? Don't fucking look at me like that. I just did what the old broad wanted. The way she was crying and carrying on. You're lying. Grandma never cried. On my life. Crying, apologizing about how she raised you, talking about how she hid your gifts and shit. What gifts? I don't know. She said something about that old barn. Leeza, why are we listening to them? I found them. When we were in the barn, I found the gifts. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? She cared? She tried to kill us! It wasn't real. There is no apology good enough to cover this. Oh, she wanted to apologize to you too. Me? I, I, I thought this was all about how racist she was to poor Leeza. No, no. She told me the way that she raised you made you hate Leeza. No. -That's bullshit. -Because it-- You had your sister fucking arrested. Hey, hey, hey. It's not bullshit. It's not. But that doesn't matter. Keep-- let's let that shit go. I forgive you. Let's just be sisters again. I'm-- I'm s-- I have to be alone. I'm sorry. Isabel. Come on. Isabel! Oh, Leeza, don't worry about it. Okay? Really, she'll come around. How do you feel about this? It's been-- I need to find out. - You're not coming? - Nope. I don't give two fucks about those gifts. I came here to get you, get the money, and get out. The money is real? You know what? Even if the money is real, you're not getting any of it. And after all of this, you're not getting me either. The only thing you can get is the fuck out. But that old bitch promised to pay me. Well, I don't know if you haven't heard, but my grandma is dead, along with her promises. Fuck. What about you? I think I'm gonna stay here. Me and your sister have some things we need to talk about. I was never abandoned. I was never unloved. I was never alone. I told you. Hey, Iz. So it turns out... ...the money thing is true. - I can help you look for it if you want. I said I wanted to be alone. I hope you know I didn't mean to hurt you. They basically called me a racist. And you did too when you signed up for this. Why? Because of Leeza? She broke into our apartment. Because of you! I remember that day clearly. I remember you'd forgot your pearl necklace. I also remember Leeza calling you that day. A lot. That night... ...you insisted that I check out the apartment while you called the police. Did you leave the lights on? No. This place is a mess. -What the hell? -What the fuck? -Someone's been here. -Everything looked fine. Except... Hang on, did you hear that? I'm calling the police. Go. Go! - I checked out the bedroom... - -9-1-1. -What's your emergency? -...and there she was... -...asleep. -Hey, Hey. She'd been celebrating... ...after seventeen years of hell, seventeen years of being made to feel like she was nothing. She'd finally found the courage to leave your grandmother, just like you did. She needed a place to stay. And she looked to you for help. She trusted you. But you never answered her. That's my sister, please. So she took matters into her own hands. Isabel, tell them. Please. Isabel, tell them. Tell him! You had the power to stop them. You didn't do anything. You probably didn't notice, but I was already unhappy. But after that... So... ...you think I'm a racist? I don't think you mean to. Look, I never stopped loving you. That's why I'm here. -I thought that maybe this might-- -No. No! I made a mistake coming here. -I just thought that if your grandmother could change... -Stop it. -...then maybe-- -Stop it. Enjoy your life, Isabel. I hope that your next token Black girlfriend doesn't see through your shit. Take that back. I am so sorry if the truth hurts. Take that back! Deonna? Deonna. What the fuck? -Calm down. -What the fuck? It was just an accident. Shut up! No shit! I'm calling the cops. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? I'm sorry. Accidental dial. Hey. You okay? Yeah. -Oh. -I'm fine. You know, even though I hate how she did it, that woman... ...this helped. I feel like we can finally be sisters again. Mm. Yeah. - Sisters. - Are you ready to go? -Deonna is gonna have to try to drive-- -No, um... Uh... Deonna told me about the money. Why don't we go look for it? For real this time. Together. Okay. Yeah, okay. Together. Yeah. As a team. Wait. No! Why? Why would you do that? Why? I'm your sister! Half sister. Get her in the house. No! No, no! Oh, my God! You killed them! You fucking killed them! God damn it! Why? Call the police. I left it in Deonna's truck. I'll be right back. Okay? Are you okay with all this, huh? I'll keep an eye on her. I'm not sorry. You fucking murdered people. I'm not sorry I had you arrested. You're a thief. What? You look just like Mom, you know? -Same colored hair. -I know what you're doing. -Same blue-gray eyes. Same nose. -Yeah. Yeah. Mm. I don't think I remember her, so. I remember her some. Her hugs. Her kisses. But that was before Grandma got her hooks into you, feeding you that racist bullshit. See? There you go again. Never taking responsibility. Okay. So tell me this, then. Did you ever actually love me? Yeah, that's what I thought. Doesn't matter. You'll be the cops' problem soon. Mm. What's funny? Dead bodies... ...a white woman tied to a chair... ...a convicted felon on the premises. Black convicted felon. Who do you think the police are gonna believe when they show up? Hey, did you call the cops yet? -Not yet. I couldn't find a good signal-- -Don't-- um... Let's get our story straight, so when the cops get here the right person is blamed. Sounds so smart, right, Amber? -I, I think RJ has a phone. -Mm. Okay. Okay. Okay. I got the phone. What are you doing? Gas... ...from the generator. See? I thought about what you said. Burning this place down. Not a bad idea. And you get a front-row view! You don't have to do this. You don't have to do this. What about the money? We never found it. Oh! Now you believe Grandmother? Mm. I don't know. I'll figure it out. Maybe I'll write another book. Isabel, please. Please. Let me go. Let me go! Mm. Let's see... ..."She just went crazy, officer. I don't know, I guess being in prison all those years turned her from a thief to a murderer." How's that? I was wrong. At least Grandma knew she was a racist. You are so much worse. I am not a racist! Do you know how many times I got thrown into that crawl space? No! Open! Please! No. I'm the good one! Me! Look around, Isabel! You're the felon! You're the thief! I'm the good one. Me! Me! No! No! I'm going to burn this place to the ground! No! Isabel, no! Isabel! I'm going to burn this place to the ground! Don't leave me in here! Goodbye, Leeza. No! Fuck it! Isabel! Crazy. Racist. Bitch. -Thieving. Whore. Cunt. -Get off! You found the money. Mm. Give it to me. Give it to me. Stop. Stop. Don't be stupid. I need that money! Leeza. Leeza. Sis... ...let's talk. -Let's talk. -Now we're sisters again? Here. Here. Here. Here. Let's talk. Come on. Let's just talk, please. Please! -You-- -I know I messed up. I know. But deep down I'm a good fucking person! You took everything from me. I made a mistake. Okay? I made a mistake. -I know I messed up. I'm a good person. -And you think -this will help you maintain your image? -Leeza-- Just fucking give it to me. -Fine. -No, Leeza. Leeza! Go get it. No! No! You sure this is the right spot? This is what the lady on the radio said. -Hey, stay close. -I know. - I need you to step back, son. - -Hey, hold up. Hold up, my buddy. Hey. Hey, how you doing, man? What's, uh, what's going on here? Uh, we're investigating an alert we received about a furloughed prisoner who tried to escape.
