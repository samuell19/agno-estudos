STRANGE PLACE FOR AN ENCOUNTER A film by Fran?ois Dupeyron - Get out. It's over between us. - No. Search for that girl. - I've told you it's over. - No. - You're crazy. Get lost. - No. Vincent! Vincent! Vincent. Vincent! - You smell like chicken. - Excuse me? I haven't smelled that in a while. A chicken. A luxury chicken. - I smell of chicken? - Yes. - A chicken. - That's ridiculous. - What's wrong with you? - I don't like chickens. The same goes for someone else. He paid for such a nice coat. You'll regret it. Let go of me. My husband will come back any minute. Perhaps you also noticed a woman on the road. My husband almost hit her with the car. I've been here for two days. Maybe she wanted to commit suicide. There are many good reasons for committing suicide. I was afraid my husband would hit her. I closed my eyes. But he remained very calm. We could have killed that woman. I wanted to get out of the car. I couldn't stand it anymore, it was stronger than me. Even the sound of the engine frightened me. I was really shocked. My husband suggested that I should rather wait here. Are you still under shock? Yes, I've had trouble breathing. My husband is trying to find her. You won't fool me with your stories. I've seen and understood everything. And I couldn't care less about it. But one thing is for sure. You can't stay here. It's not possible. Why that? Am I bothering you? - You can't. That's all. - I won't be here for long. I promise. You can't stay at all. You wouldn't understand anything with your small brain. I'm telling you that it's not possible. That's all. You get in the first car that stops. And you drive away. - To go where? - I don't know. Wherever you want. It doesn't matter as long as you won't stay here. It's not possible. I have to wait for my husband. - Otherwise he wouldn't understand. - In that case I'll explain it to him. No, you don't know my husband. I'll have to wait for him here. But I'm telling you it's not possible. Are you completely stupid? I saw it all. Your husband won't be coming back. He ditched you. It was great. I almost applauded him. He's quite someone, your husband. Maybe he's not even your husband, but that's none of my business. Why wait an hour, a day or ten days? Because he won't be coming back. It doesn't matter what you say. You don't know my husband. I'm sure he'll be coming back. Can you please tell me the time? Nine o'clock. Then believe that he'll come back, but if you want to wait, go somewhere else. Not here. I don't need a chicken here. I need to be alone. Do you understand? Why won't you look at me? What's it to you if I wait here? It really won't take long. I promise. - A nice night for a drive. - Yes. But even more so for stopping and taking a piss. - My car broke down. - That's bad luck. I hope it's nothing serious. No, the car is not a problem. I'm more worried about my wife. In fact, she's not really my wife. That's why I didn't want to talk in front of your wife. She's rather nervous and I'd like to see her get back to Paris. Would you mind dropping her off at the next station? She could drive on from there. With pleasure. We can arrange that. Well, the problem is that it's not going to be easy. Because she wants to stay here with me. That damned Catholic morality. She thinks that it's retribution for her sins. I don't get it. We may have to use force to make her get inside the car, all within the bounds of what is reasonable, of course. Once she's in the car, then there is no more problem. - Fine. - No, no. That's quite tricky. But if you think it must be done, there's no choice. I'm going to warn my wife, otherwise it will be too much of a surprise. I'm going with you. What were you doing? The lady asked if we had seen a woman on the road. - A woman was on the road? - Luckily, my husband could avoid her. - No, I haven't seen anyone. - Very close by. No. Maybe I dozed off for a while. It really shocked me. I hope somebody stopped, she must have had a problem. Well, let's hope somebody stopped. Get in the car, we still have a long way to go. The gentleman told me about your problem. I offered him my help to drop you off at the next station. Is that alright with you? That's really kind of you, but my husband wouldn't understand. He'll be here soon. - The gentleman has offered his help. - That's enough. Listen, we can't both stay here. Forget those ridiculous morals and come with us, my lady. - Why do you insist, Louis? - Don't interfere. This matter is complicated enough. How are we going to do it? - Open the door. - What are you doing? Let go of me. Let go of me. What are you doing? No. Have you gone mad, Louis? Don't get involved in this. Stay out of this! I'm scared, Louis. - I'll explain it to you. - Don't get involved in this matter. I'm sorry, I have to go. - Good luck. - Yes. It's no use hiding. Hey! Do you hear me? I know you're here. I can smell chicken. Are you perhaps up in the tree? With your bottom up in the air? Do you hear me? You haven't tricked me with your stories. I saw everything. I won't be fooled by you. Come out right now. I can smell girls like you from miles away. From miles away. I'll find you sooner or later. You'll come out on your own once it gets cold. The night is long out here. You have nothing to fear. Nothing. I'm trough with women. I've had enough of the tricks and lies. Do you understand? Does your small brain understand that? You're getting on my nerves. You're behaving like a child. I'm not blaming you. I just need to be alone and you're still there. It's not that complicated. Imagine nothing else. Do you hear me? There you are. Why didn't you answer me? You don't want to talk? That's fine with me. It's not warm, right? Good thing he left you that coat. Maybe he knew he was going to ditch you when he gave it you. Some men plan it in advance. You're still dismissive. But when it gets colder, your coat won't be enough. Your eyes will water. Your makeup will run. And then you get into the first car that stops. This is no place for a chicken. Any woman would understand that. You have cold feet. What do you want from me? Nothing. I just want you to leave. That's all. - Do you have the time, please? - Ten o'clock. I hope it won't take him too long. Otherwise, you'll catch a cold. - Are you waiting for someone? - Leave me alone. - Come on. - Leave me alone. This is no place for you. They smell your presence. It attracts them. Do you see this line? Do whatever you like, but don't cross it. Do you want to make yourself useful? Then look for firewood. Is it serious? - Is it a serious engine failure? - It don't know, it's possible. - Do you have experience as a mechanic? - No. That's too bad. I know I just asked, but could you tell me the time again? It's late. Almost midnight. The fire is a good idea. I almost put my boots on today. Aren't you cold? I'm never cold. It's really none of my business, but you behave like... You don't behave like an adult. Why wait stubbornly in the cold? It's obvious your husband won't be coming back. You don't know him. He'll come back. Don't get your hopes up. When a man ditches a woman like that, he won't come back. It's not like you think. Not at all. He's a man... He's an extraordinary man, capable of anything. One day, after we had a fight, he just disappeared. Nobody knew where he was. Not even his friends. Do you know what he said when he returned? He didn't pretend he hadn't left, but he didn't apologize either. He just said: "I love you". Just that. That was proof enough. I'd have done the same. Most men would return with a gift or flowers. But he gave me something of himself. I was really happy. He had given me a proof of his love. You know, I'm lucky. It's luck to experience a strong and passionate relationship. And that's why you wait here until you freeze to death? What's a few hours in the cold? That's a small price to pay. Why can't you wait for him at home or in a caf?? At least there you won't freeze to death. The next station is just a few miles away. He wouldn't be able to understand my love for him. Nor does one understand the love of others, right? He proved his love so often despite the difficulties we had. And now it's my turn to prove my love for him. And the best proof is that I'm waiting here where he left me behind. Doesn't that gesture make sense to you? I guess so. He expects me to wait for him right here. He wouldn't understand if I did otherwise. Do you want a blanket? Thank you. Don't I look ridiculous like that? I wouldn't want my husband to see me like that. - I annoy you with my story. - Not at all. I didn't plan on spending the evening with a woman. That's all. It's unexpected. Yes, it's unexpected. Just like accidents. I didn't expect that accident either. I'm wasting your time. Do you need to disassemble the entire engine? Yes, I have to if I want to understand what's wrong with it. - Can't you notify a car repair shop? - What for? To repair it. It's a breakdown, right? That's obvious. But it's not what matters most. What matters is... The breakdown is an excuse to disassemble the engine. I seized the opportunity. You understand? Yes, I think so. You have to become an adult someday. All those things you do without knowing why... One day you have to look for the motives. Otherwise you won't control any situation. You just do what others want you to do. That's all. And why not start with the engine? And then comes the rest. There are a lot of things I'd like to understand. A lot. Understanding gives certainty. But it's a search. And for this search one must be alone. I'm not saying that because of you. You're here by chance. But you're a presence. A presence is terrible. A female presence. With you around, it's hard for me to concentrate on that engine. That's how it is. Tomorrow you have to leave. - He'll come back tonight. - I know. But the next day you may see things differently. If you like, you can sit in the car. It's not much warmer, but it's more comfortable. I'd love to. I've got very cold feet. I would like to take off my shoes. Go around. You read a lot. So does my husband. - Are you a doctor? - A surgeon. Are you surprised? - No, but it's not what I imagined. - Here! Dry your feet! - And wear these. - Are you sure? You easily catch your death with cold feet. - They're very big. - You're not going to run tonight. It's been a long time since I ran, but I hang on to them. They're as beautiful as women's shoes, they are light and delicate. These contours reach into the track. They're as light as a woman seducing a man. Do you like music? We likely don't have the same taste. It has been a long time since I last spent an evening in a car with a woman. You do this at eighteen when you have just got your driver's license. Later on you want comfort. It's different. A car is not a bad place to get acquainted. - Are your feet warmer? - Yes. I feel very tense. It's the nerves. I need a tranquilizer. When I take one of them, it's quickly over. But I forgot them. That woman on the road looked so desperate. - Won't it make me sleepy? - No, it will just relax you. I mustn't fall asleep. Because he will never look for me in car. Do you like this music? I'm sorry. The first moment is so important. I just want to see him get out of the car and know that he loves me. It's beautiful. But it's still a bit sad, even though it's cheerful. - Do you think I'm crazy? - No, no. You're a dreamer. That's not an illness. Don't you like this music? At night I'm suspicious of music. It can depress you if it's too sad. You know what I mean? But I love this kind of music, especially at night. You must have been a real nuisance for him to abandon you like that. Did you see a man in a grey car looking for a woman? I fell asleep. He's a tall man. Haven't you seen him? - Keep your voice down. - I'm sorry. - Are you sure you haven't seen him? - No. - How long have you been here? - An hour or two. I don't know. Did something happen to you? Did you see a man in a grey car looking for a woman? - Have you seen him? - He's looking for a woman? - Yes, I'm his wife. I fell asleep. - I haven't seen anything. A man is looking for a woman. His wife has lost him. Did you see anything? He hasn't returned? I fell asleep. He couldn't find me. It's your fault. I shouldn't have been allowed to fall asleep. - Get in. - Why did you give me that pill? You knew that I would fall asleep. - He likely didn't return anyway. - Yes, he came back. I know it. But of course, everyone was asleep in their cars, so nobody saw him. He must have searched for me all night. How will I explain this to him? All right. Get in and close the door. Is that all you can propose? It stinks in here. - Don't approach me! - Listen! Do not approach me, I said. - I need to tell you something. - Do it from there. I can't. It's important. I have to look at you. There's nothing for you to see. I'm almost naked. Don't look at me. Wait. I have something important to tell you. - I don't want you to look at me. - I'll stay behind you. It's important. Last night I've been thinking. I've changed my mind. I can't say why, but my perspective has changed and I realized that I like you. I'll take the risk. You can either leave in the first available car or go together with me wherever you want. I can go anywhere. We have to wait a little. I'll first have to fix the car. But it won't take too long. Do you understand? Either we go together or you leave alone. There you go. I'll risk it. - I'm not a woman for you. - What do you mean? I'm not a woman for anyone. That doesn't make sense. You're still in shock. You need to calm down. You have to forget him. You have to forget this parking place, because you can't stay here. - Where would I go? - We can go anywhere. You just have to decide. I have said my part. I'll go for a walk while you think about it. - How's it going? - Fine. - Do you know where the doctor is? - He went there. Are you together? You weren't here yesterday. I arrived yesterday evening. Stop it. I haven't finished. What do you think you're doing? Calm down. You're not going to tow it, are you? I've lost enough time already. We're going to tow you to Saint-Gratien. What should I do in Saint-Gratien? Parking here is limited to 48 hours. I can't disassemble an engine in 48 hours. That's what we are saying. Do like everyone else. You should have your car repaired in Saint-Gratien. Be satisfied that we don't fine you. - What about all this? - Help me with it. - Be careful. - Yes. Put it there. Are you coming? Right here. - Be careful. - Yes. It's bad luck to have a breakdown on a Friday. That ruins the weekend. I can't get your car repaired before Monday. I warn you in case you're in a hurry. Here everyone is in a hurry. Could we make a stop? I would like to have a coffee. No problem. My cousin works at the petrol station over there. I'm sure he could repair the car before Monday if he wanted to. But because it's Saturday he can't be bothered. What do you think? Should we wait until Monday? This one is not good. By the way, my name is Charles. Charles Ribaut. And yours? - I'm France. - France. It makes no difference. But it's nice to know. Don't you mind staying here? This isn't good either. Don't you want to go far away? Where do you want to go? I don't know where I want to go. It was better over there. I'm going to Toulon to visit my brother. And to see the sea. How about you? We can go somewhere else. But the sea is beautiful. It changes all the time. The change of air is good for you. It's good for your health. What do you think? The sea. Yes, it's a nice idea. I can't wait to see the sea. Let's sit here. It's a good spot. Why are you laughing? Did I say something funny? No, sorry. It's unpleasant here. So unwelcoming. Can you smell that? Awful. I don't know what it is. Something like stale cabbage. - Is there cabbage for lunch? - Not before eleven o'clock. I see. I don't feel right here. Thank you. - Miss, did you work here last night? - Yes. Didn't you see a tall man here around nine o'clock? How would she remember? This place is so busy. He was wearing a dark suit. Yes, I saw him. - Are you sure? - Yes, he was sitting over there. - Did you talk to him? - Yes. What did he tell you? He said he was scared by a woman who had thrown herself in front of his car. A crazy woman who wanted to kill herself. Is that all he said? Tell me exactly what else he said. He also told me that he had done something that wasn't right and was waiting for a woman. Did he say that? How did he say that? - Try to remember exactly what he said. - I already told you. Tell me again. He said that he was waiting for a woman. How did he say it? He said that he was waiting for a woman. And that he had done something that wasn't right. - And then he left? - Yes. After a long while. - Sylvie. - I'm coming. - Did he wait long? - Almost the entire night. - Almost the entire night? - Yes, a very long time. - Sylvie! - Excuse me! What difference does it make? - He waited all night. - A part of the night. He left. That's what counts. He left. He thought I'd come here. He waited because he found a nice girl with whom he could talk. That's all. He waited because he thought that I'd come here. It's my fault. I should have come here. You couldn't know that he would wait here for you. - Shall we go? - Yes, come on. Let's go. - Leave without me. - Not that again. He waited here. I must wait here. I can't leave. Well, we'll wait for him then. We might be here for a long while. Take a seat. Thank you. But I can't stay here for a long while. Well? You have to make a decision. Just leave me here. If you can't make up your minds, I'll leave the car here. - Do as you like. - And who will pay me? - How much is it? - 600. 600 francs for 10 kilometers? No, to Saint-Gratien. - Such a woman is not easily satisfied. - You shut your mouth. - Good luck. - Yes, get lost now. No regrets? Why don't you leave? I'm in no hurry. And I like you. Where are you going? Excuse me. I need to repair last night's damage. I've got the same outfit. It's strange to see it on someone else. But it looks good on you. My husband likes it a lot. Men like these outfits, don't they? We had a problem. My husband left and I had to spend the night here. All I have is this wrinkled outfit and nothing to change into. Something like that bothers my husband. He's sensitive to such details. I want to look my best when he returns. I know it's asking a lot, but it's very important for me. What do you mean? - Could you lend me your outfit? - This one? Yes. You must be kidding. I'm wearing it. I can lend you something else. A pair of pants and a blouse. - No, I need this one. - I'm sorry, but I can't. - Don't be cruel. - Stop it! That's enough. You don't understand. I'm desperate, it's all my fault. I'm dreading my husband's return. This is a critical moment. I think he's having an affair with another woman. It's my fault. I'm losing him. I have to win him back. Don't insist. I said no. I'll pay you. Ask whatever you like. I said no. What's it to you? My outfit reminds me of what happened with my husband. I want to forget about it. She's crazy. She wants my outfit. She spent the night here without her husband and wants my outfit. She even offered to pay for it. I have the same outfit. It brings back memories. The first time I wore it was on an extraordinary weekend. It was before he'd met that woman. We were at the seaside and I felt at once that he liked the outfit on me. He looked at me differently. We hadn't seen each other for a while, and I also had a new hairstyle. Lots of little things brought us together again. Each time I wore that outfit, I felt something stir in him. I must try everything. Sometimes little things make a difference. I'm sorry, but I can't do it. What do you think? But I need it. You're happy, nothing will change for you. - What should I do? - I don't know. Let her have it if it's important. I need my bag. Are you not working on the engine? I can't concentrate and I don't feel like understanding it today. - Have you read this? - Yes. - May I borrow it? - It'll last you a week. - May I really? - Yes, of course. Have you seen a fifteen-year-old boy with brown hair? No. He disappeared while we were buying petrol. - What is it about? - Why don't you just read it? - I don't have time for that. - Come on, get in. It's cold. I can't read. I'm too nervous. Read it later. Such a book can't be summed up like that. It's not just a story. Yes, I know. But I'd like to tell my husband about it. I'd like to impress him, you know? I won't be able to read it. I'm not as smart as he is. However hard I tried, I wouldn't be able to do it. He says it doesn't matter, but it does. I'd like to show him that I tried my best. That I didn't just sit and wait. I'm sorry. You're cold. You're in love with me, aren't you? I mean, you're a sentimental person. It's a pity. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. - Stop apologizing. Yes, I know. My husband hates me kissing him. I can feel your heart beating. I've been married for fifteen years. I don't even know if I'm still desirable. This isn't a good place. It's too depressing - I'll call the repair shop. - Not now. I can't go yet. - But when? - I don't know. I don't want to think about it. I want you. What's wrong? I'm sorry. I'm a fool. Forgive me. What for? I don't know why I did that. Forgive me. This will hurt you, but you weren't the one I kissed. You sat next to me and I spoke about my husband. It was he I kissed when I closed my eyes. I had my eyes closed. You thought otherwise. Yes, I thought otherwise. You should call your husband. I was so stupid. Did you hear what I said? You should call him right now. - Not yet. He wouldn't like it. - Then when? I don't know. This evening if I'm still here. This evening or right now, what difference does it make? Why are you rushing me like that? I'm not. I just want us to leave this place. I won't go with you. Not today, not tomorrow. Because I need him, I love him. Even if... Even if he doesn't love you? Even if he hates you kissing him? Does he even still touch you? I'm fed up with him. Write that snot-nosed kid that we've had enough of his antics. I'm in charge, not him. Let him prove his worth. Let him work like everyone else. Then we'll see if he still gets these crazy ideas. Not so loud. Why didn't you order cabbage? The whole place smells like it. Write that he doesn't know anything at his age. He doesn't know anything about real life yet. He must wait and keep his mouth shut. - Write that we waited for two hours. - Calm down. Not so loud. Yes, I'm keeping calm. It's always me who has to calm down and shut up. It is I who look like a fool. Write that this was the last time. I wrote that he hurt us. And that we'll never shut the door in his face. But that there will be no more vacations with us. Give me a hundred francs. He won't be able to get by without money. You've changed your outfit. I prefer this one. It's less austere. You tend to wear austere clothes. It excites youngsters and puts husbands at ease. I tend to drink too much. When I like a woman, I drink because she dislikes me. On the other days I drink because I rarely meet a woman I like. Do you want to know why I like you? No, I can't tell you. Are you still thinking of him? You'll have to forget about him. You'll need me. We have to get out of here. It'll take time. I'll give you all the time you need. You'll have to change your habits. It's true that love isn't just love. It has to do with habits. You'll see. You'll get used to me. You'll change. You've changed already. A woman who has been ditched loses some of her arrogance. You haven't the same... You know what I mean. That's why I like you. I don't take too much risk. Even though I know that you're too good for me. I'm drunk. I'm talking too much. The more I drink, the more I talk. It's like with a cat. The more you pet it, the more it purrs. Good thing you avoided the cabbage. It's going to stick with me all day. I don't know how I'll make it back to the car. Listen, you have to call your husband. Hello! Hello! You searched my bag. Hello, Vincent. Is that you? Wait. Don't hang up. I'm sorry for calling you like that. Did you arrive safely? Weren't you too late? Is the mimosa frozen? I know you waited for me last night. The waitress told me. It's stupid. I didn't think you'd be waiting here. It's just like me to keep waiting there while you were here. That woman really scared me. I was anxious all night. And when I woke up... I didn't want to sleep. I wanted to wait for you, but I fell asleep. Do you understand me? I've been thinking a lot. I think I've changed. You'll see. You'll be surprised. This morning, I put on a dress you like. The one I wore in Bruges. Yes, I was lucky. Where am I? I don't know the name of this place. But it's the station near the highway where you waited for me. But I'm waiting for you, Vincent. Yes, I know that it's a long way, but I thought... But I love you. I'm waiting for you because I love you. Tell me what to do. Are you there? Say something, Vincent. Please. A day here is a long time. Vincent, I'll wait for you. I've read a book you'll like. It's a wonderful story. Do you hear me? Vincent? Vincent, tell me when you will come. I want to be ready. I want to see you arrive and get out of the car. You want me to stay one more day? I don't believe you. Don't say that. It hurts me. Don't hurt me, Vincent. I want to live with you and love you. No, don't ask me that. I can't. Vincent! Vincent? Vincent? Vincent? I'll wait for you. I'll wait. I know you'll come. You always do. Are you there, Vincent? Are you satisfied? No, but it was necessary. Now we can leave. I shouldn't have called. I know that it's difficult. Go away. How many times do I have to say it? - You can't stay here. - I told you to go away. You can't do anything for me. Get out of my sight. I can't stand your voice. You're like all men. You stick like a leech. You're like an animal waiting to pounce. You scare me. Your gaze scares me. Get it all off your chest. I hate sweaty men who eat cabbage and cling to me. Why are you so proud? You can't admit that he ditched you. You don't have a choice anymore. He got rid of you. He's the first of many. It'll happen again and again. History repeats itself. It's terrible. Leave me alone. I'll wait here as long as it takes. This is reserved for trucks. - I have a car breakdown. - That's no reason. This is reserved for trucks. - You don't care? - I do. Good. Then move your car. Can't you park further along? Don't be a pain in the ass. I'll park here if I want to. That's it. - Now get lost. - But I have a car breakdown. I've just done 800 kilometres and I'm parking here. Is that clear? - Do you understand it now? - No. That guy's a complete idiot. I'll make you move. I explained it nicely, but it's no use. - Are you not quite there? - He's a doctor. He's an idiot. Move or I'll wreck your car. Leave it. He'll go eventually. No, he says he has a car breakdown. All right. Let's go. Come on. - ?velyne is sending some girls. - I don't fuck strange women. Are they bothering you? You can go and sit in the car. It's quieter. I'll wait here. I don't need your car. If you do want to, it's not locked. Good evening. Let me apologize for what happened. I thought you were alone, but you're with a lady. That's different. I'm glad you parked your car in front of me. When I can't park, I enjoy having nice neighbors. You're not saying much. It's too bad getting stuck here with such a beautiful woman. You're not saying much. A pity. If you want, I can move the car. I don't want anything. I know what you want. I saw how you looked at him. Cabbage is too tame. You prefer beer. - Do you still have a breakdown? - Are you not in bed yet? - I don't like to sleep. - And your parents? Screw them. At your age, that's the only thing to say. - What are you still doing here so late? - Is it forbidden? - No. Are you on the pill? - No. - Why not? - I don't sleep with just anybody. Perhaps, but you should still take it so you don't need to marry anybody. Are you really a doctor? You don't talk like a doctor. Forget about me being a doctor. It puts me in a bad mood. Have you known the lady long? Since last night. She's crazy, isn't she? - Who said so? - Her husband. - What did he tell you? - That she's a bit crazy. - Stop telling stories. - It's true. You want to leave with her, that's why you don't believe me. Would you take me away? - Take you where? - It doesn't matter. - Don't you like it here? - I don't want to die in this dump. Do you think I'm too young? You want to be older? It's natural at your age. - You didn't answer. - You're not too young to leave. There'd be no lack of offers. - But would you take me? - No. - Because of her? - No, no, no. Because I'm too young? You're like the others. - I'm like the others? - Yes. If I said yes, you wouldn't know what to do. - You didn't answer. - You couldn't even pack your bags. - If I pack, you'll take me? - Tomorrow you'll have forgotten it. Answer me. Will you take me? Pack your bags and I'll take you. - Really? - Yes. - Great. You're really different. - Go to bed. See you tomorrow. - Where are we going? - Toulon. I've never been there. See you tomorrow. Where are the girls now? It's been two hours. ?velyne said they'd be right over. Maybe they went to the wrong parking lot, like in Germany. What did she say exactly? She said she was sending Agathe, Sophie, Catherine, and the others who I can't remember. We can't wait forever. It would be better if we were gay. I'm tired of it. Let's grab a truck. Thirty kilometres is not a big deal. It's sixty kilometres. And we have to turn around. We won't turn around. Driving in the opposite direction? Why not? There's nobody on the highway at this hour. Count me out. That's not like you. We'll take my truck. I'm not as drunk as you are. Come on. - Are you scared? - You're completely crazy. Do you like this music? Don't be silly, Georges. You must stop right now. Stop! Stop it. Slow down or let me drive. Slow down. That must be them. Yes, I recognize the car. Castanets and double step. A popular tune requested by Isabelle for Jos? who must now be on the way to the factory with his bicycle. I'm driving fast. Very fast. She likes it when I drive fast. She has fallen asleep. It's a very clear night. There's no one on the road. The trees are in bloom. I can smell mimosa. She loves mimosa. She talked about mimosa. I like its smell. I'm driving with the windows open. One can hear the sea. She wants to stop for a swim, but I like to drive at night. We'll swim the next day, when it's hot. The night is cool. I like it when the nights are cool. I also like the nights to be long. I don't know where I'm driving, but I don't care as long as the night is long. She said that she wanted this trip to last forever. I'm afraid of losing her. I told her and she said that I was silly. But I'm still afraid. Other women had said the same thing to me. But it's different with her. She's too beautiful. Like sharp steel that wounds. Loving someone always results in some kind of death. What's wrong with your engine? - Did you disassemble it? - No, I just... I've never seen anything like it. Do you want some help? No. It's just that we can't leave before tonight anyway. - Your wife is strange. - She's not my wife. She wanted to do something stupid last night. She just needed a man. - No, it's not that. - But she slept with a man, didn't she? So what? That woman shouldn't be left alone. - How much do you want for repairing it? - Nothing. I like doing this. All right. - What's the hurry - I was afraid you already left. - You're afraid? - Not of leaving. Just of staying. - Have you changed your mind? - No, it's not that. - Isn't that too much luggage? - I didn't know what to take. - I can leave a bag behind. - No, put them in the car. You're really taking me? Yes, let's go. What about your parents? Nothing, I haven't told them. If they knew, they'd kill me. My mother has a depression. I went straight to my room last night. Otherwise, she'd have noticed something. Anyone would have seen that I was unlike the other days. I waited for them to fall asleep in front of the TV. Then I came here with my bags. You were asleep in the car. Then I went back home. - He's repairing your car? - Yes. - We're not leaving right now? - No, this evening. Go and have a hot chocolate in the caf?. I've got something to do. Don't you like hot chocolate? Don't talk to me as if I were ten years old. Don't sulk. I won't do it again. Do you know her? We found her a few kilometres away. She had no papers. She can't even remember her name. Don't scold her. It's nothing. It's a nice day. It's nothing. That's her. I recognized her. Do you believe me know? She recognized me too. That's why she spat. What time is it? Nine o'clock. Already nine o'clock? This is a good day for me. What's today? - Sunday. - Ah, yes, Sunday. He won't be long now that she's here. He mustn't see us together. He always comes when you least expect him. He won't come back. Come on, we should leave now. - No, leave without me. - I'm not leaving you here. I need your smell. I can't get it out of my head. - You're crazy. - Yes, I know. But I need to look at you, to be close to you. Even though I know that it's crazy, since you're still thinking about him. You're beautiful this morning. Beautiful, no. Not for you. You know too much. That's what I like. - It's because I know. - Leave me. I need to be alone. I'll wait here. I want to see him get out of the car. It's fine here. Go away. Go away. - Are we going to leave this evening? - Yes. - It's like the Middle Ages here. - Yes. There's so much I want to do now. Will you help me find a job other than waitressing? You'll soon go back. You'll miss your parents. No, I'll never come back here. It's depressing here. There are only fields and old people. - Will you help me? - Yes, I'll help you. - Are you regretting it? - No, I'm really glad you're here. You'd rather go with her. No. Do you love her? Don't let yourself be confined. Loving someone is like being confined. Love lasts for a year at most. - After that things change. - How would you know? I know. After that, it's poisonous. That woman waiting for her husband, it's ghastly. Didn't you ever want to die because you got ditched? Yes, but I'm not dead. Now all I want is a genuine relationship with people. With you, it's easy. I shouldn't say it, but I'm as happy as if I were in love. If you get drunk, we won't be able to leave. It's your chatter that's making me drunk. I usually never talk much. It's as if I'd been asleep for years. I finally woke up last night. I've aged years overnight. It's crazy, right? Yes, it's crazy. Do you realize what you're making me do?
