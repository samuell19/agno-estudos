Roberte Roberte! Leave me alone. - Close the window. It’s cold. - You can't miss the first migration of the year. Go by yourself. - A flock of ducks before the equinox, that's rare. - Oh, the equinox! For 40 years, it’s all you ever think about. - But it's you who wanted to go hunting this morning. I don't want to anymore. How much is that? 3 shots That’s not 3 shots. -3, I swear. Look again. I’ll go downstairs to prepare the rifles. Hurry up. Horrible Milan I can't see a thing. Why did you wake me so early? - Don’t move. Look. I love that. It’s like a girl undressing. Milan! It’s beautiful. - Yes. Very beautiful. It’s a jay. But that’s not game. It is. People eat them. You aimed well. It was flying quite high. You’re a good shot. It’s the male. The female must be worried. Look! We can shoot it from under the trees. Hey! No. We should’ve shot the female. It would’ve been more humane. - It's true, I’m like a woman from those realist songs. Yes. A drunk! One day I’ll find you, sitting on the sidewalk with two litres of red wine. That’s how I’ll end up. What is it? Do you see that tree? Yeah, why? - The pigeons settle in it. - Oh let me go! - They sleep on the large branches. You have to shoot almost straight up. The pigeons are in your dreams. You told me... You told me: "I found a new love,.. ".. and I’m leaving you. " I begged you to stay, but you left anyway. I hate you. Of course. Me, for years I dreamed.. .. I entered a night club,.. .. and I found you there with a man,.. .. and you told me: "This is my new lover. And you left with him, laughing. - Do you still have that dream? No. Of course. Hey! Shit! - There! You have to know what you’re doing. If you hunt ducks, you can’t shoot pigeons. -4 shots won’t wake every duck in the neighbourhood. - You can’t hunt with a woman who isn’t serious. You always end up embarrassing me. That pigeon was fast. Of course it was. - They call them "rowers" because they row.. .. with their large wings, silently like champions. Ducks can’t row. They make noise like amateurs. The pigeon passed by like a ghost ship I adore you. Me too. What a country! You can’t hunt in a country if there’s no game. It isn't duck season yet. - so what, they shoot hares on opening day. This winter, we’ll go to the river. We'll make such a massacre that you will be disgusted and with wild geese, the most beautiful game. Sure. Say,.. .. why don’t we go to the casino tonight? No. - We should! I’m better at roulette than at hunting. - We’d lose what we spend here in a month. - We can leave a month early. - No. You’re a bastard. Of course. But it’s true! You’re overacting! Ah! You brought it along. I’ve done well, haven’t I? - You've had a drink, huh? Sitting by yourself just now. Just 2 swigs. Shall we go on? I’m tired. She’s a bold one. She has a tender look. Well that doesn't mean anything. - Hello, Madame Milan. - Hello, Radiguette. Hello. So? - Oh, nothing. A thrush and a jay. - We can open a bird museum soon. - You’re funny hunters. Did you have a good time? He scolds me for it. - You lead a comfortable life. You do as you please. - But with Milan. - He isn’t difficult to live with. - For a foreigner, he has settled down well. - That’s what you said. How are things with your husband? - We don't have the time to bother one other. Does he chase girls? - He needs a young one from time to time. How do you feel about it? - When he's caught, he's nicer to me. Say, you’re clever. Are you coming? Radiguette will never take us seriously. She knows all about life. So do I. Perhaps. Where were you? - Le Mans, in '56. The first time I drove for Jaguar. - You say it as if you were scared? - It’s hard to find the right word for the feeling. Especially at the start of the race. Yet, you broke the record that day. - It’s funny, I can’t remember it very well. All I can remember is the dress you were wearing. A blue spot, on the left, as I approached the straightaway. The one you bought for me in Rome. Yes. - And while I tried it on, you made a date with the salesgirl. One of life's little pleasures. - Aren't you getting a little fed up with this small village? Here or elsewhere... - Don't mind me. - Good evening, Madame Milan. Hello everyone! - How are you? - I’m bored. It’s unbelievable. - It’s not funny. - It’s the way you said it. Where is Mr. Milan? - He’s working. - He isn't bored? - You'd like if he came for you. Who's that? That's the new teacher. Good evening. Good evening, Madame. - Well, just in town and you're already at the pub. We'll be great friends. I live here. - Do you want a drink? - No, thanks. - You've got principles. - No. I’m just not thirsty. - You have a pretty laugh. Jacqueline, my pastis! You have a minute! Have a seat. Yes I’m bored, you see. - I understand, you are used to having strong emotions. You already know? It's the first thing Jacqueline told me. What did you say? - When a man like Milan settles here... - Jacqueline! - Sorry. - I already knew who your husband was. Do you like racing? - At home, we watch it on TV I saw you once. Oh yeah? - It was a day when Mr. Milan had won. You were crying with joy. I wish I had been in your place. I'd like to see you there! - It must be difficult to live with a man like that. I couldn’t. Surely not. Hello. Good evening. - So champ, already at your post? Our veterinarian, Miss... - Hйlиne Morel. - Hello. The new teacher. Jacqueline, a Ricard. 2 Ricards. 20 under the mark like usual? - No 40. I have to get used to it I'll leave you to it. - Not going to play? - No. Goodbye. Goodbye, Madam. - Say. Join us for dinner tomorrow evening. Thanks. Milan adores young girls. No it was the year where Collins wiped out at the chicane. Milan got there just behind Monte Carlo, 2 years ago. Oh yeah, 2 years already. The next day we had a sacred feast Colins wanted to beat me. He wanted to skin you! Don’t you remember? At the bar? They sat next to us. I told you: They’re scheming. "They will have you in the chicane" No luck for him, that year. Behra was having trouble with his tires. I passed him. He pulled a long face. It was over for him. Were you going fast? - The Casino corner, you enter it doing 120. No one has come out alive at more than 180. Wow how could you see Behra’s face? - I was going 180, him 175. Like 2 trains at the same speed I'm silly! I was at the top.. .. of the chicane with Luigi. He groaned. That Milan has no respect... They arrived at the bottom. Moss entered too fast and wiped out. Collins caught Moss' wheel and went out as well. A pole from the chicane.. .. fell onto the road. Milan arrives. Makes two controlled slides and he passes through. You must have been scared. We’re always scared. What a life! - My father bought me my first car when I was 18. I wanted to be a race car driver.. and I especially wanted to be a writer. But writing is much harder. At first I wrote about racing. It was a compromise. And later on I raced. That’s Monza, isn’t it? - Yes. My first 1000 miles. I wasn't a driver yet. I was reporting for a paper. Octave Zabo took me on as a teammate. You guys look happy. - I got a taste for it. It started with him. He was great. - Yes, but above all he was my best friend. He died. Some brandy? - Of course. She's already talking like you. How? Nothing. Is this your first assignment? - Yes. I finished school at the end of May. You aren't bored in the village? - Not yet. I'm preparing for a new exam. I want to be a travelling teacher. Why are you smiling? Does that sound funny? No, but I don't quite understand. - It's for those who've finished junior college. We have more freedom. A bit of home economics and we take care of their leisure time. 3 hours a week in each village per district. We'll go by car. I'll start with a 2CV. It's a more enjoyable life. More independant as well. - Independence matters a lot to you. It's the reason I work. When I was your age,.. .. I thought the meaning of independence,.. .. was not having to work. Your parents were rich. My parents? I never knew my father. And... .. my mother was supported by a friend. We spent our vacations in his chateau. 2 shots. In Scotland. He was an Englishman, my mother's friend. - The situation didn't bother you? - No. He taught me English, and good manners. In exchange, I taught him the subtleties of slang. We were very good friends. And when my mother wanted me to work. I laughed in her face. And when she threatened to cut me off,.. .. I said that I would hit up.. .. "Uncle", my mom's friend. She relented? She had to. She could have chased you. - A mother doesn't call the police to bring her daughter home... How do you say it? I would say: "domestic issue". That's it! I'm not looking for you. Of course not my dear. - You still think your mother was wrong? More than ever! Doing a job that you hate, is like sleeping with a disgusting man. I love my work. You are a kid. When is your new exam? Is it soon? - I've known Milan for 10 years. - In the middle of May. -10 years! It's even worse than if I depended on my mother. and you? - Me? - Yes, you. Who do you sleep with? Oh! You're 20. I hope you aren't still a virgin. Roberte! I beg you. - My fiancй and I, we often... Do you love him? - Yes, otherwise I wouldn't go out with him. She is pure. - Your fiancй lives in the region? - He's doing his military service not far from here. What's he going to do afterwards? He's an aeronautical engineer Is he your first? Yes Will you receive him at the inn? I'm a teacher. I can't afford the gossip. He's stuck in the trenches, at night at the end of the dance. In the country? The lack of comfort increases the risk. Afterwards you can sort it out. But the first time, is always tragic for girls. What about girls from Paris? Oh... It happened to me... .. 12 or 13 times, I don't know. He doesn't either. But it's not that bad. Leave her alone! - For the moment of course, but you quickly forget. They'll all tell you the same thing. What are you looking to do? To spoil your evening. Come, I'll see you home. Come back to see us. Don't be a stranger. Yes - It's never easy to live as two. - How come you don't race anymore? I think I'm afraid. You? It was after Octave died. When I learned of the accident, I had a feeling, a kind of change I'll drop you off here, since you value your reputation Goodnight See you soon. If it happens, I'll manage. What? You aren't going to tell me anyways... All women sort it out. I forbid you to see those people. - You don't know them. - A woman who drinks... - She's not like the others. - Fortunately! It's not that simple. - If he had guts he wouldn't have retired at 40. I already explained that. - If all race drivers gave up after the death of a friend. He's a coward! - I'm sure he hasn't had his last word. and you defend him! Oh, you are stupid! *- Like every Sunday, from 14:30 till 17:15,.. *..

I'm with Milan, for better or for worse. -32 Red, loses. - You make me lose We are at the bar. - I'll come when I break the bank. - You can't force a woman like Roberte to live on a farm with pigs. You think she looks after pigs? Have you known her for long? She was the most talented of all, the most beautiful. The craziest, the most true. - You think she's changed? - When Milan was sad, she drank with him. They lead the lives of monks. But she loves him. - When he went to see other women, she was the most elegant. Now he's become a misanthrope, and she sees nobody. - She reproaches him. - Yes, but she stays. On 4. No more. 13 Black, odd. - My numbers aren't coming out. Did you win? No. Can you give me some money? You forgot our rules. Come on. No. - Roberte! - Have they left? Yes. Here.

She's lit up, she burns. Games, alcohol, love are only excuses for her to burn. Just how you like her! - It's what makes me so fascinated by her. No more bets. 29 Black, odd, and high. Just our number. - The game is over. It will resume tommorow at 3pm. Good night, gentlemen. Roberte. Roberte! I have to go home. Come, we'll have a drink! Give me 3 shots. Make it 4. Stay here! Good night Good night, Hйlиne. Good morning Good morning. Sleep well? How's Roberte? She wanted to stay at home. - I was just going to she how she's doing. Wait for me. I'd love to. What are you doing? - You got a flat tire just when you passed me. But that's absurd! Yes? Hello Oh, it's you! Wipe yourself off. You'll catch a cold like that. - We were running, but the rain caught us by surprise. Oh yeah? You didn't ride your bike, today? I got a flat.. .. just as I ran into Mr. Milan. Hйlиne,.. .. stay like that. Does she remind you of anything? We had walked for hours. You told me about your job. I didn't dare ask you to go to a hotel. It was raining. But you didn't mind It was in Paris. - Then when you finished drying your hair,.. .. I went to the window. Hйlиne, please. Why? - Please, humor me. Go over to the window. I stayed there for a moment watching the Seine. And then I turned around. You were lying on the bed smoking a cigarette. You reached your hands out to me Ant... .. you took me by the wrists and sat me down. I was happy. I was so happy that day. And you told me, that you loved me. That was 10 years ago. - What he'd give to get rid of me! How can you say that? - You think you know him better than me? - If you knew how he loves you, how he speaks of you. Yeah He also loved Octave. Octave? Did he tell you? What? Octave committed suicide. He was mad at me. Just before the Italian Grand Prix,.. .. He called home. I wasn't there. He begged Milan to tell me that he could no longer,.. .. that I had to choose between them. and if I didn't join him the morning before he left for Monza,.. .. he would crash out in the first turn. That's what he did. Milan never told me anything. That's a crime A cowardly crime! No! - An adventurer, a bastard! - He was really in love with Roberte. Great excuse! - and you, are you capable of killing for love? Certainly not! and if he continues corrupting you, I'll smash his face! - You'd be too afraid of the consequences - That's the least of my concerns. You? - I was a bit drunk. Forgive me. Of course. - It makes me crazy when I feel you walking away. Anger really suits you. I've never loved you so much. - It's my pleasure to be angry for you. I love you. - Don't you lovers ever get bored! - She irritates me! I can't listen to her anymore! - You'll hear it from her. and the whole country too. I do what I want. - We'll say that I'm your lover. - What do we do in the barn? - That's not the same thing. - It's over. I won't go to the barn with you. I will make love in my bed like everyone! Hйlиne is right. She's free. We knew they were dating. So why hide it? You never see the bad in anything. Where are you going? - To get some air. I don't feel right. - You're surprised? - Why? - You're always like that when you have a new love in mind. So, sleep with her so we can have some peace! Give her a kiss for me! Mr. Milan is not here. I'm here to see Madame Milan. - Oh! Just in time. You can help me. You alright? Yes. There! It will be good for Milan to work there by the fire. Are you always going to keep your hair up like that? But it doesn't matter. Look. Look how beautiful you are. I can't teach like that. - You won't be teaching your whole life. Something is missing there in the middle. I've got a table upstairs. Come with me. Have a look in the bathroom You'll see better. You can put some on. What's the point? Let me do it. Why? Because it amuses me. It's silky. I washed it this morning. Milan is nervous right now. - The high wind puts everyone on edge. Yeah It's also... lack of sex. When you live together a long time, you no longer want to. I already thought of that Duval and I, we've thought about it. Beware of it becoming a habit. Yeah. Oh, Milan, for him, it's a habit, it's... It's only prostitutes. He doesn't hide anything. He likes to tell me his exploits. He's probably more discreet with you. For me, the real whores, don't bother me. But... .. but I couldn't tolerate Juliette. Juliette? Yes. She was my best friend. All the time at home. She found me... .. beautiful, intelligent,.. .. elegant. So, the day I discovered that... .. she and him... It didn't last long. I assure you. What do you say? And Juliette? - One night, at a friend's place, he left with her. And didn't return until the next day at noon She had the audacity to come over a few days later. Everyone was there. We had many guests then. And then, I cursed her at the door,.. .. with a pair of slaps in front of everyone. Maybe she really loved him. So what? Sure, I can't prevent him from chasing girls. But I can't allow someone to take my husband. - What did Milan do when you slapped her? - He yelled a little, for appearances. To save face. What's become of her? Oh, probably a whore. She was talented for that. And if she really loved him? - But you don't love the husband of another woman. Has Milan seen her? I don't think so. But it would not surprise me if he still wants more I'm going to fix your eyebrows. - No. Yes. I want you to be beautiful. You can look now. How do you find yourself? I'm a little bit frightened. - More than ever you have the deadly gaze of confidence. Why do you drink so much? - Do you have something better to offer me than this? - I don't want you to be unhappy. I want to see you in an evening gown. I'm not unhappy, you know. Here. Look at this one. Its beautiful! Well, try it on. Try it on! Careful of your hair! You have beautiful breasts. You must show them. Milan said they are glorious. Look at yourself! Go on the bed, you'll see better. You are beautiful. You are awkward. You are charming. Here. That's all I killed. It's a dirty beast. It looks like the birds in my nightmares. Good evening I taught her to be beautiful. Are you angry? I thought you really liked that dress. and take your dirty bird! - I'll leave you the feathers to dress the kid. But what's the matter? - I don't know. He's nervous. I told you. I must go. You won't stay? I have assignments to correct. How do I take all this off? Do you want some coffee? I asked if you wanted some coffee. You can't stay angry at me, you know. I won't give you that pleasure. So? You took the pretext to go hunting.. .. to go by Hйlиne's place and tell her to come here. You could have hooked up with her,.. .. instead of going to kill a raven,.. .. to make me believe that she came here by chance. Spend your life at her place if that amuses you. It's your tricks that I dislike. I don't want her to take me for a fool Why do you hide? Why should I hide anything? Because you are a liar. I also wonder why you're a liar. It's your evil nature. - It's true I lie to you often. You admit it. I lie to you out of pity. You don't know what I think of you - You have pity? But no. You are mean like all weaklings - That's also true I'm afraid of you. You're the only one I'm afraid of. You are afraid to admit the truth. - I'm afraid of you like I was afraid of Hell when I was 13. You control me like a confessor. You're sick! I've made my life with a sicko. And you don't have the courage to admit that you went to Hйlиne's.. .. to tell her to come here. - Roberte, shut up! Admit the truth. - How unhappy you'll be the day I stop lying! Anger! That's all you are able to provoke from me. Admit what! I hope you die. One day, I'll kill you. Good night Good night Good morning - I've decided to pick my pears. What is that? A lobster who grew up too fast. It has a velvet claw. It won't damage the fruit. Even a primitive machine helps man. - You must have a gentle hand else the fruit will escape. Fall to the ground and become overripe. I'm afraid of being too clumsy. - You look rather embarassed by this tool. - Come help me tame it. - If you want. Leave one for me. There - I told you I was clumsy. Go on. Taste them. - They aren't ripe yet. Leave them in the granary for 3 weeks. This one. This one instead. You're right. 31. 32. They'll be good in 3 weeks. Let's hope I must go home Did you love Juliette? Roberte told you the story Did you love her? I think so. and she? I think she loved me. And you never saw her again? No. She had to suffer I imagine she suffered. You never tried to see her again? - Cowardice is one aspect of married life. Why are you married? - When we got married, we were no longer in love. But she was helpless. I didn't want to save myself for a bourgeois marriage. - She should've refused the marraige. It wasn't her line of safety. - She has no job. In love, security comes with age. - Sometimes the two of you say some monstrous things. And Octave? Octave? Yeah. The telephone call. It's true. I didn't believe it. Passion has no morals. I love you. Good evening, Madame Milan. Unload the car. Be careful of the bottles. I'm late. There were many of cars on the highway! Here. I wasn't able to find parking in the prefecture. Look. It's a new boy from Paris It's not bad. Ah! You know what I brought back? A case of scotch. A change from Radiguette's brandy. Bargain. Looks like it came from a boutique. You're making a face! Heartache? Yes? Italy? Did you call Italy? - Yes. I did. - Thank you Miss, we did. I called Luigi. - You called your manager while on vacation... My vacation is over. Is it true? - I was lucky, a place opened at Ferrari I was offered a contract. What position? The last. - You can't accept. They'll pass you off a spare car. Training starts next week. At Modena? Yes. I do like Modena. Who says I'm taking you? - You'll be unhappy if you have no one to torture. We'll celebrate. I almost suspected it: Because I bought lots of food. - All preserved food! You two eat poorly. It makes up for our drinking. In fact you don't have to worry anymore, we're leaving. Where are you going? - Milan is back in action, we're leaving for Italy - I knew you'd go. You guys need your fun. Hйlиne is what worries me. Why? - It wouldn't surprise me if she has a crush on Milan. You haven't noticed? When he's not busy with her, she's ready to cry. - She's always around Your stories go straight to her head. It will pass. - Yes, but for kids of that age, it can be serious. I don't want her to do something foolish. What's going on? We never see you anymore. - I have work My exam is approaching. You're not upset with Milan? Why? - Don't blame him. It's his 40 year equinox. But what a number with his raven! I forgot all about it. You coming for dinner? - No. Duvel might be coming. Another time. - Don't delay if you want to say goodbye to Milan. Goodbye? - You haven't heard the news? The press had nothing to say? He's resuming training at Ferrari. - So we won't see him anymore around here? - He's going to race in all the Grand Prix January in Buenos Aires,.. .. March, Mexico, April, Monaco. are you leaving too? - Like usual, trailing from behind. To chase away the reporters. and to handle the hero's bad moods. Luigi is coming to sign his contract. Are you not coming? Yes I'm coming. You're sure, you don't regret anything? Absolutely sure. You care so much for this girl? Enough to know what I'm doing. - And you've never slept with her? - No. I love her innocent gaze, her sincerity. All that wouldn't last living with me. One year of crazy love and 10 years like Roberte and I had What do you know? - It's inevitable. I've had 10 years to understand it. Here! You're never late! Dear Roberte! The country suits you. - Did you have a good trip? - I drove all night. - There's not one minute to lose, is there. Hйlиne, come! This is Luigi, the sporting director of Ferrari. Hйlиne Morel, our friend. A pleasure. - You're going to have dinner with us and discuss the contract. But it's been signed. You took advantage of my absence! When Milan trusts someone, he'll sign anything. But Luigi is a bandit. - Milan knew very well what he wanted. I couldn't say a thing. - You've become a businessman? - Anything can happen. When do we leave? Milan has to be there tomorrow. I'll go pack quickly Have you booked our rooms? - Milan prefers to stay at the factory. No. They'll talk shop all the time. He will live alone. What? It's in the contract. And me? You stay. Are you kidding? - Every month, we'll send you a third of his salary. You're taking her? No. I don't want to start over with her what we've already done so well. Get in. I'll take you back. Take the wheel. He's gone. What are you going to do now? Nothing. I'll never have the time to live a great love. But I love you. Me too. You coming? It's time for dinner. - It will take a moment. It won't move. This is troubling. Maybe we should go there.
