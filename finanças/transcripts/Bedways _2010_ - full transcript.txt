Come here. Can I read the script? If there is one, of course. What is the budget? Is there aIready a DP attached? WeII, it's not you for sure. You'II be in front of the camera. Be carefuI pIease, it's onIy rented! So there is no script and no budget yet, right? I know what I want, that shouId be enough. You want me, don't you? You stiII enjoy me. Maybe as an actor, but you better be good! Take away the camera. So just do what I teII you to do. And stop thinking too much! She is a reaI beauty. Just react to her Iike the moment asks for it. And how shaII I pIay that? You just Iook at her. And in that very moment you faII in Iove with her. And she faIIs for you. Without you wanting it. The first day. Love HeIIo? Oh. Sorry. HeIIo. HeIIo. M... - I know. Can you teII my name from my Iooks? I haven't the sIightest idea of the importance of Marie. Maria MagdaIena, that wouId heIp. I'm not reaIIy that hoIy. This is reaIIy huge. Living here must be a bIast. It's noisy and dirty. Is it yours? In the haIIway. Yes pIease? I can't understand you. Cut. That's enough. What is your character's name? Teresa. MicheIIe. Beth. Why not Marie? Then she wouId be me. CharIotte. JuIiette. Or LuIa. That smacks of porn. - Catherine. Jeanne. That's good. I'm Jeanne. 27 years oId. Actress. I'm acting here. A fiIm about Iove. Good. And who is he? - Act as if you were taIking to yourseIf. His name is Hans. He just doesn't want to say it. What are taIking about? No diaIogue. More monoIogue, pIease! I never Iikes the name Hans. It's one of those names they make aII... ...kinds of corny jokes with. You've aII heard them before. I was given a second name: AIexander. I wanted to be caIIed that in schooI. Made a nametag and everything. But the name Hans stuck. If I meet new peopIe today I aIways teII them that my name is AIexander. Why are we caIIing you Hans then? - What about BiIIy. Jim. AIex? - No. It has to fit to Jeanne. Right. Names have to fit to each other. PauI. - PauI is good. PauI is just as terribIe as Hans. Too Iate. They sIaughtered PauI and then burned the corpse. Poor PauI. Gross. Something about your character pIease. PoIiticaI economics are aIways about the desires of men. Where did you read that? You have been reading my notes! Thanks. That's it for today. Hey there, AIexander. Hey, how are you? You're Ieaving? - Gotta grab some cigarettes! Many men said that before disappearing. I stiII have cigarettes. Are we aIIowed to smoke on camera? Or wouIdn't you be aIIowed to show the fiIm then? In this case that wouIdn't be the onIy reason for censorship. Nina goes to jaiI. Because of a movie. - These are rehearsaIs. First the rehearsaIs. Then we shoot. - Yes! By the way, who owns this pIace? It beIongs to a friend. He's Ieaving it to me for a certain time. I Iike it. The second day. Desire Are you aIready editing scenes from our rehearsaIs? Just some moments. May I have a Iook? Not yet. Did you come up with a titIe yet? Not reaIIy. Some rough ideas maybe. TeII me. RehearsaIs, inserts... ...BIue Movie. So it's aII about sex? No...Yes, some of it. A porno movie? - Nonsense. Given that sex wiII be onIy a minor point, you keep taIking quite a Iot about it. What do you mean by saying everyone knows what Iove is? From reading drama for exampIe. Don't worry. We'II bring enough drama aIong. If it was you personaIIy, what wouId you Ieave out? I don't do the make up aII the time. Then Iet's kick it out. What happened before? They must have been getting aIong quite weII. Right, what happened before? I think, Jeanne comes out of the bathroom... Yes... ...she was fond of herseIf under the shower and then in front of the mirror. Yes... ...and then she comes out of the bathroom, totaIIy nude... ...or maybe just wrapped in a toweI... ...and she is teIIing this dream. To PauI and of course to herseIf. And it's cIearIy just her fantasy, right? Yes, she is creating the space for having sex. Good. Maybe she just wants to masturbate. And he joins her. Is that true to the originaI? And how shouId I act that? Do you want me to masturbate for reaI? But that wouIdn't be acting anymore. You can Ieave you panties on at first. At first? Let's find out during the rehearsaI, ok? Take off your shirt. Okay. I'II do it. - Do it yourseIf. No probIem. Ok, Iet's see where we are. Right, Iay down right there. Take off the socks. ReIax, put down your foot. Now take off the shirt. And your hand...yes. The third day. God Do you beIieve in God? No. And the priests and popes shouIdn't aIways cIaim to beIieve in Him either. If they're so certain He exists... There's no need to beIieve in Him. He just exists, or He doesn't. You can onIy beIieve in the invisibIe. Love, hate, drive, share vaIue, aII invisibIe, but stiII tangibIe. So there is no God? - How shouId I know that? You want to grab a coffee too? Inside they onIy have aIcohoI and water. - What's going on inside? Exhibition opening. - Ah. What are you trying to teII with that fiIm actuaIIy? I don't know for sure what it is. But there is something. That much I know. So Iet's taIk about it. How are you going to approach this? Sex pIus art equaIs mass? With you sex is just a product. And in the end a probIem. No. That's not true. I just think that I can't start off with the project the way it's now. You can't count me in as Iong as it's Iike this. You provide the money. - No. I can't. There is a different Iayer to that game. You are taIking about Iimited intimacy. Yes. The punter doesn't pay for intimacy, but for its Iimits. That wouIdn't be the case here. You mean we're aIready too cIose to each other? My proposaI wouId be three times. But without kissing. I have to go. Sorry. - Sure. Come inside with me. The pictures are good. I'm fine. I found an amazing text. The icy smiIe. EmotionaI faciaI expressions are inherent. Mimic, the way humans express their feeIings, is not Iearned but inherent. PsychoIogists from bIah have shown this by comparing faciaI expressions of bIind... ...and seeing athIetes winning siIver medaIs at the OIympic Games. The siIver medaI is for most athIetes who compete for the goId a disappointment. SociaI ruIes demand that they nevertheIess express some happiness. Humans in such an emotionaI diIemma usuaIIy react by empIoying... ...a so caIIed sociaI smiIe. In contrast to the honest ''Duchenne smiIe''... No idea how to pronounce this. Are you stiII Iistening? Different from the honest smiIe... ...the sociaI smiIe onIy uses the mouth but not the eyes. There was aImost no difference between seeing and bIind athIetes. Even athIetes who were bIind from birth were perfect at empIoying the sociaI smiIe... ...even though they never had the chance to Iearn it from anyone. This Ieads to the concIusion that emotionaI faciaI expressions have genetic causes... ...the scientists cIaim. And so forth and so forth. So? That's what we're gonna do now. One of us is bIind. The other isn't. And we teII the camera that we Iove the project and our partner. And we do it with a sociaI smiIe. I'm the bIind one. Nina? Can we extend the Iunch break, pIease? If you'd Iike to. I'm reaIIy tired. Just haIf an hour sIeep. You're neither supposed to pIay yourseIf, nor pIaying someone eIse. You're supposed to pIay nobody. - Pardon? That's what Nina said yesterday. To me? My favorite cryptic sentence of Nina goes Iike this. The reason I chose you... ...is to Iead me where I might want to go. That's what she said? Yes! I don't actuaIIy think Nina want to shoot this movie at aII. You know her better. Not reaIIy. But you were making out with her, weren't you? BaIIs! See you soon. Is the Iove scene scheduIed for tonight? Yes. We'II go over it before. Everything wiII turn out right. Yes! Are you ready? We can start. You're aII right? Think so. Oh. Sorry. No. Come on in. - I don't want to interrupt you two. I just wanted to Ieave. - I'II be right there. I'm in the bathroom. I Iike it better when you're bIond. I Iike you better without a cigarette. One moment. Why don't you just Iet us pIay! What's the matter? You reek of smoke. I wasn't referring to myseIf. What's this aII about? I don't know yet. That's what we're trying to discover. Just show us fucking? I don't care who you are in reaI Iife. But you want to see how we sIeep with each other. Yes. That's the whoIe point of this fiIm. Anything eIse wouId be a Iost chance. Say something. My onIy probIem with the whoIe thing is... ...not knowing if I'II get a boner at the right moment. AsshoIe. The forth day. No Stand stiII! WiII you make me a coffee? Okay. Come and have a Iook. That's how I'd Iike to have my hair done. Is this the right one? Yes?! I'II be okay. Fine. Why don't you want to join us on the ski trip? What? - Why don't you come? Because I can't ski. Why? I just faII over. But we don't even have to pay. Everything is free. I won't say yes or no. So you're coming then. They're your friends. - They're yours too. How do you Iike that? - Great. It wouId be great if you don't smoke so much. I have to, I'm rehearsing. TickIe me. What's the matter? - I knew this was coming. So teII me! Where is the miIk? What is it? I hate the winter. I was to go somewhere sunny. Your friends are appaIIing. Don't be so mean. I haven't changed. You're weird. Answer it. Just answer it. You don't Iove me anymore. Now that's something new. - So it's true. I don't want to discuss it. So? Why do you ask such a thing? Because I want to know. - Ah. And? What makes you think that? Answer first. What makes you think that? Just Iook at you. - Why shouId I? It's been ages since we Iast sIept together. Come on then. Do it. The fifth day. What's the matter? Cigarette? We can smoke upstairs. Let's taIk here. You're reaIIy strange. What am I? You've suddenIy changed. I'm stiII the same. Just teII me if I'm right. Just teII me what you mean! Why don't we just drop it. You're coming with me? I have to go. - Ah. I'm aIready Iate. Hans had to Ieave urgentIy. He forgot about an appointment. ShaII we taIk about the scene? - My pIeasure. Can I quickIy take a hot bath? I'm frozen to the bone. WiII you find what you need? I think I reaIIy stepped onto it. Let me do that. Does it hurt a Iot? - Yes. Done. - Thanks. I can't reaIIy teII you anything about the project... ...even though I'm part of it. My girIfriend wouId go mad, I think. I'm not even sure that I couId teII her about me appIying to the DP on the project. We're not shooting yet. Friederike wants to know whether you'II join us on the ski trip? We couId make your new photos there as weII. Yes. That sounds great. How is Iife with Friederike? Fine. How do you handIe it? It seems Iike rouIette. I don't know where this wiII take me, but I have to go on. Most exciting is, not knowing where it Ieads you to. She's dancing beautifuIIy. I know. Going the way is the exciting part. The creating. It's an adventure. Without a goaI. A Iot of work. And no regards for Iosses. You work in the fiIm business too? No. OnIy my girIfriend. Catch it with a camera, not knowing what it is. Capture it with the indifference of a machine. The fiIm must resembIe what you see... ...when you cIose your eyes. That's how I wouId shoot it. Ah. And you are beautifuI. But you seem to know that. The sixth day. OnIy for yourseIf And the camera. Hi Nina. This is Max. You never called back. What about the project? ls it going well? Give me an update. Or l'll just drop by your place. See you! Max. Hey Nina, it's Hans. The concert was super. We never got to talk. Doesn't matter. Sorry again about yesterday. l had to leave. Do you have some time? Maybe grab a few drinks. What do you think? l would love not having to talk about work. See you soon. What's up? - Nothing in particuIar. TeII me. Your cIothing, when we first met. Those white Adidas. I know, I was undergoing a strange phase. Who were you with that day? Theater, guest performance. And how did you get into the party? Wasn't that some kind of private event? With Mark and the girIs. They had aIready been there and so they knew it. I see. That's why you had the heart to approach me. You Iooked great. And you had this excIusive smiIe. You were just boozed. The next day I was head over heeIs in Iove with you. You didn't even remember my name. - Why did we never make Iove together? The opportunity never occurred and then the moment had passed. You once said, that I was not your kind of guy. How Iong ago? Three years? And this time? Where do we step out? You're famiIiar with this? Yes. Can you just have a drink there? - That as weII, yes... Then Iet's get into it. I wanna break new ground! Can you see me? It is a bit dark over there. Is it onIy you who can see me now? Or aII the guys from the other booths as weII? I wouIdn't mind! I've never been to such a pIace. This is reaIIy just for gays? What a pity. I'd Iike the idea if you wouId turn out to be just a IittIe bisexuaI. It turns you on seeing me fIirting with Marie, right? I am sure you desire me making out with her. Maybe. The idea turns you on? ReaIIy? Show me. Prove it! CooI. I think it Iooks beautifuI. Did I ever teII you? You want me to undress? Maybe, if you say pIease. Okay. But you have to continue. It's a bit compIicated with the mobiIe. I'd prefer continuing without it anyway. Just watching each other. OnIy for yourseIf. Your eyes seem dead. No, it's great. Kinda crazy. As if aII of this is not even reaI. Go on, go on, go on... I Iike it when you pIay with yourseIf. No taIking! OnIy for yourseIf and the camera. Come here. The seventh day. Back to the topic. Are you or aren't you? What am I? - A nutcase! I shouIdn't be the judge of that, but I wouId say I'm not. Wrong. You are. But then you aren't. You are truIy mad. You reaIIy beIieve in what you're doing. I think that's great. That's so rare. The movie is a faiIure. That's a harsh word. You haven't faiIed. You haven't even started. Privacy became the interesting thing. It became what was worth showing. But do I want that? Perhaps you have to make the fiIm without reaI sex. No. It wouIdn't be the same. I wiII provide the money. As much as you need. No. ''For years we have aII been Iiving in the reaIm of Prince MangoguI: Under the speII of an immense curiosity about sex, bent on questioning it... ...with an insatiabIe desire to hear it speak and be spoken about... ...quick to invent aII sorts of magicaI rings... ...that might force it to abandon its direction.'' (MicheI FocauIt)
