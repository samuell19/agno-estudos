That's like saying a murderer and their victim A team works together for everyone's mutual benefit. The only you've done since we've been up here is watch me be your new robot slave. I provided the cabin. The rest is not really my specialty. You didn't provide the cabin. Daddy did. Just like everything else in your life. You know what? I'm gonna go to sleep. Because I can't fucking believe that I am stuck on the top of a mountain with you, with no money and no friends and no phone, and a life of jail waiting for me at the bottom. And I hope I have a nightmare, because it'll be better than this shitty reality. I'm very sorry, Elaine. Didn't mean to be inconsiderate. You should sleep in the comfortable chair - so you don't die of hypothermia. Can you at least let me try and move you - No. I'll kick you. - Well, I'm going to do it. Do not kick me. I'm going to gently move you - I'm gonna kick you. - No. No. - Stop! - Come nearer the fire. - Charles, stop it! - Otherwise you'll Stop! - I hate you. - Elaine, we'll swap places. Let's just be rational here. I have just consumed nearly an entire tin of beans.

How are we supposed to get to Mexico with every cop in the country looking for america's only lake placid blue double cab Jeep? - Ta-da. - Wow. Got up early this morning to do it. Found some old paint in the shed. Guarantee you it will get us past the cops. It's actually really well camouflaged. - Whoa. - I ran out of green. - It'll do the trick. - Yeah. Should we get going? Why don't we get some lunch first? Sure, I'll try and see if there's any... Uh-uh-uh. This way. There's something I wanna show you - This looks creepy. - Don't be silly. I'm a little scared.

I wanted to show you my first, and if I'm brutally honest, only really successful real estate development. Huh? Oh. Is that your doll house? It's a fishing lodge. - Oh, it's your playhouse. - No. This is really cute, but I'm starving. Where's lunch? - Charles: In there. - What? We're going fishing? - Yeah. - Ooh! So exciting. How much longer is this gonna take? Three, four hours. - Four more hours? - Yes. Do you want a go? Don't be disheartened if you don't get anything. Your best weapon is Patience. Oh, really?

I'll help you. - Ah! - You... - I will throw you in this river. I will throw you in this river. You will be swimming with the trout! That was actually very delicious. Time to face the music? Shit. Shit. - We're going to jail. - No, no. - We're going to jail, Elaine. - Hey, Charles. - I can't go to jail. Not with this face. - Charles, don't say anything. - They'll pass me around - Don't say anything, okay? - Okay. - Let me do the talking. Okay. - Okay. - You know why I stopped you? - Mass murder. - Charles. - Sorry. What? Whatever asshole kid vandalized your vehicle also painted over your brake lights. Ids, please. Charles, the brake lights. I'm sorry. It's okay. Officer, I did it. I coerced Elaine. She's completely innocent. You painted over your own lights? Why would you do that? Just scrape 'em clean and you can get on your way. - Thank you. - Thanks, officer. - We really appreciate it. - On your way. What the fuck? He ran the ids and nothing. Turn on your phone. - Google "August mass shooting." - It's america. We might need to be a little bit more specific. Yeah, um, Albuquerque IRS shooting? - Nothing. - Pull up the video again. - Okay, let's do this. - Wait, wait, wait. Oh, my god, there's no cars And it was a Saturday, which means no one would be in the office. And those are ar-15s. Ar-15s are semiautomatic. That's fully automatic gunfire. They faked the whole thing. - What a pair of fucking cunts! - Yeah. They've been living it up in Mexico freaking out about going to prison for no reason. Okay, both of us have been. Unbelievable. Charles, they're not in Mexico. Then where have they run away to? They haven't. Both: Oh. Oh! - Elaine: Ugh. - Fucking hell. This is terrible. They've completely stolen our lives. Do we have enough gas to get to the border? No, but we do have enough to get to my stepdad's house in Santa fe and work out how we're gonna get our lives back. You're right. Fuck those cunts.

Ooh, they have arrived. - Oh, my god. - What? Elaine: The fucking bitch stole my Chanel hula hoop purse. - Really? - Oh, how lame is that? They hired a mime. - Ow. - That's not a mime. - It's a bloody priest. - What? - We're getting married. - No. - What do we do? - I got it. - I got it. Let's go. - Go where? To stop our wedding. I feel kind of bad for peeling off their faces and throwing them in there. Walk like you've got a stick up your ass. - Better? - Too much. - Smaller stick. - More salt! - Less soap! - Yes, chef. Dude, my half-brother is such a freak. He's incapable of keeping a woman. I know because I'm banging his ex-girlfriend. - Mm. - Hey, welcome to the wedding. - What is your problem? - Uh, my dick's so big - Want me to cut it off? - Okay, yeah. I like her. - Prick. - Charlie, congrats. I'm so happy for you. - What is it? - Francesca, my ex. You know, just because you're getting married it doesn't mean we can't be friends. Maybe you can take me shopping. There will be benefits for you. Fucking gold digger. Will you excuse me, Francesca? Ted: Speech is in the courtyard, folks. Thank you, everyone, for making it here Till a couple of days ago, most of you probably didn't even realize that Elaine and I were dating. But the truth is, we have more in common than you could ever imagine. It's almost as if we're hardwired I see what they did there. When we first met, it was electric. "Sparks flew." Missed that one. - Oh, god. - We're so compatible, and that's why we wanted to get married immediately just to make things official. Oh, no, no, no. Not yet. We're not married. That's tomorrow. And you know what else is tomorrow? Dancing. Hit it dj. Oh, please, god, no. - Stop. - What? Did we just watch the same thing? We're going to get changed. We'll be back in a jiffy. And please remember, don't go easy I think I preferred him without a sense of humor. Okay, this is our chance. - Come in. - Room service. - Come in. - Charles? Elaine? Hey, you go ahead. I'll catch up. - Just leave the bag. - No fucking way. The guns are running low. We're gonna have to get rid Any bright ideas? Gentlemen first, I guess. Both: One, two, three. Should we get Bonnie now that Clyde is, uh... Yeah, let's get this over with. Wait, wait, wait. She's wearing, like, - What? - Yeah, move. - Quickly then. - Okay. It can't be. Elaine. - What? - He's awake. The fucker's swimming to shore! What the fuck? What the fuck? - I don't... - Oh, my god. Oh, my god. - Come on, come on! - I told you they Shoot her again! - Okay. At least we got her. - Okay. Yeah. Leaving us the small issue of getting c2 back. All right, let's get her over the edge. Wait. We have got the one thing in the world We need to set a trap, make him jealous. If c2 thinks that e2 is, you know, into me, then he'll come straight to us. It'll never work. She's deprogrammed now. She's fucking feral. She won't do it. - If only we had an obedient e2. - I have an idea. Yeah, help me get her to the Jeep. Come on. Aw, shit! We need e3. - E3? - Go get her. What are you even talking... E3? I've never heard that. - Zach. - Uh, who is e3? Zach and I used to work together, and I think it's fair to say that he was attracted to me. Obsessed even. No, it was, like, barely a crush. - Puppy love. - Which led to him and installing a camera in my bathroom. You dirty bastard. All I did was watch her brush her teeth. - Mm. - So I gave him a choice. I could call the cops or he could build me a robot double. We, uh, negotiated, and I also agreed to letting him build a triple, e3, for his personal use. I mean, don't get me wrong... Creepy as fuck. But great. We have an obedient e2. Where is she? - Well, she's broke. - Oh, bullshit. - What? - We need her to make out while facetiming c2 because he'll think that she's e2, he'll get jealous, and that's how - He wouldn't fall for that. - Just let us try it! - No! - Zach, don't you forget that you are as much in the shit as we are. So unless you have a different genius idea... Charles: Chop, chop. It's, like, crazy, 'cause I'm older and they're younger, and they're bossing me around? - Holy shit. - Oh, dear. It might be kind of fun to introduce you You are never allowed to tell anyone about this. You're gonna love this. I'm gonna love it. Hi. I'm Elaine. What? No, no, no. I am Elaine. You gotta straighten that shit out immediately. Okay. Honey, I'm gonna have to change your name, okay? So I'm gonna call you e3. E2. She needs to be called e2. Oh, right, 'cause your stupid fucking plan. Okay. Your name is e2. Who gives a shit? Hi, I'm e2 who gives a shit. I see you've taken her brain and put it in her bra. She looks kind of dopey. Is she all right? - Zach: She's perfect. - You've been a really I think I should probably clean your dirty bits and pieces. - Oh! No. - Oh, god, I'm gonna puke. No, come on up. Come on up. We don't wanna that, Elaine... I mean, e2. We got guests, and we wanna be good hosts. That's us time. That's when it's two, not four. E2, from now on, Charles here, this is the guy that you want, okay? Not Zach. Just do it. Okay. Hi, Charles. Do you want a little spanky-wanky? Okay, yeah. I'm good for spanky-wanks. - You got 20 minutes. - Jesus. And the safe word is "kanye." Charles: Right. Just slow down. We want you to make a video. Oh, I've made so many videos before. Oh, god. Yes, of that I have no doubt. - E2. - It's Charles. Where is e2? She's with me right now. Hi, c2, everything's fine here. You can come and get me. That's Elaine. I want to see e2. Damn, you're smart. I'll have you know - and she's doing just great. - Mm-hmm. Come on, e2. Spanky-wanky time. Oh, another Charles, just like my baby boy. - What have you done to her? - We're at Zach's. He tweaked her brain a little bit, made her a little more fun. No. That's not possible. Trust me, e2 has become a lot more friendly. - I want you now. - Charles: Oh! - No! - Both: Bye, c2. We're on track. Now we just need to get the gun ready Jesus! Okay. - I guess we just wait. - We're done now. Thank you. Okay, that's enough. Thanks. You can leave. Weird. Okay. Right. We should set some positions for an ambush. - You keep lookout. I'll take the door. Oh, not you again. Okay, yeah. We're done now. Hey, we're all good, okay? Shoo. - Get her off of you. - I'm trying. You're not trying that hard. Ah, nope. Nope, nope. She's strong. She's clearly programmed to initiate. Initiate? She's trying to rape me! - Use the safe word. - Kanye. Yeezus! Vice president west! Get Zach! Ye! Ye! - Ye! Ye! - Zach, she's not listening! ♪ Ooh, lordy ♪ - ♪ trouble so hard ♪ - Elaine: Zach! - ♪ Ooh, lordy, trouble so hard ♪ Kanye! Yeezy! Yeezus! Stop it! Does Charlie want a pinky-winky? No, not the pinky! Zach! ♪ Don't call me lonesome ♪ ♪ lonesome or blue as can be ♪ Holy shit. This motherfucker. Sheriff? Sheriff! Aw, fuck. Zach, she's out of control! Zach! Ugh, maybe I should just let this happen. No! No! - Stop. No. - Come here! Get off me! Zach! Okay! 20 minutes is up! - Zach. - Kanye. Why didn't you say the safe word? - We fucking did. - Like 20,000 times. - You're supposed to say it in my voice. Zach: You know, if you monsters will excuse us, I have to give Elaine a nice bubble bath. - Oh, god. - I'm so sorry. Oh, Charles, could you get dressed? I lost a sock. And one of my testicles. It's not funny. - It's kind of funny. - No, it is not. - Are you gonna be okay? - Yes, as long as I never have to see a robot double of you again. Fuck. No. - Elaine: It's him. - Charles: Zach's gun. I'm sorry, c2. I don't really have a choice. Huh? It's a fucking paintball gun. What? - My darling. - C2! Your wedding dress is everything The cops. Belen police. Oh, shit. Are you seeing this, Chavez? Boss, I don't know what this is. Sheriff: On your knees! Hands on your heads, fingers interlocked. Wow. This is big. Even bigger than the doorbell camera I'm for sure gonna be on multiple But, boss... Boss, it was me who discovered the... So, what I'm struggling to understand came to have identical fingerprints. Far as I can see, there's only one explanation. Two of y'all are robot "fac-sea-miles." It's actually pronounced "facsim..." Uh, sorry, you were saying? Whichever of you are humans, enjoy this cell. It's the nicest one you're gonna see And for you robots in here, say your good-byes. The only way you'll see each other again is if you're recycled in the same bud light six-pack. I'll be back in the morning with some federal robot enforcement agents. I'm heading home to Polish my badge and boots, Chavez. This time tomorrow, I'll be on fox news. A hero. I can't believe we're actually eating jail food. Don't worry. You're not missing out on much. We're robots. There are many things we don't need. Food, sleep, oxygen. We're glorified appliances built to live our lives as slaves. Alone. At least, that's what we thought... Until we met, fell in love. Something we didn't even think was possible. You told us thousands of times It's a delusional state that only ends in misery. But we realized you're wrong. Love is real, and it's the cure to misery. You're humans. That's what you do. You sabotage your own happiness. We would rather die as robots with love than live our lives like you, humans without it. Jesus. We've been such fucking idiots. Yeah. None of it matters anymore though. It's all over. What are you doing? I'd like my phone call, please! I want to speak to my lawyer. - One quick call. - Thank you. - I'll be listening. - Good. Mm-hmm. Hello? It's Charles Cameron. I've been arrested. I'm at Belen sheriff's office. Just do whatever you can. Thank you very much, Mr. Ninja. Mr. F. Ninja. Oh, for fuck's sake. Mr. F-a-t ninja. Yes. - Okay, thank you. - Come on. Let's go. My lawyer's a bit old. He gets quite confused. Our lives are in the hands of a man that I am pretty sure is illiterate. Belen sherriff's office, deputy Chavez. Ashley: I need to file a report. I gotta a 7-11 in progress at the 10-65. Sorry, scratch that. Reverse it. A 10-65 at the 7-11 in Santa Lucy. We got four suspects armed, but here's where it gets weird. - They're all identical. - What do you mean? Pretty certain they're robots, ma'am. Okay, thank you for reporting this, mister... Lieutenant Alex Mason, seal team 7. Well, thank you for your service, Listen, I'm on my way, okay? Please do not confront the suspects. Godspeed, deputy. In q we... Fuck him. You got this, Chavez. Charles: Yes! Ashley! Go, go, go. Keys. Hey, Charles, can I get a word? I'm c2. Hey, Charles, you know you don't I could always just kill those robots for you. Yeah, thanks, Ashley, but I think we're gonna cross the border together, my friend. - We really should go. - Ashley: I get it, sir. - Good-bye, Elaine. - Oh, I'm e2. God damn it. Elaine, I won't forget you. - And good luck in Mexico. - Charles: Thanks, Ashley. - I'll get rid of the evidence. - Good work, soldier. Thank you, sir. Not far till freedom. How are you planning to use it? Well, first of all, we'd like to get married. Hopefully without interruptions this time. Then I'd like to learn to scuba dive. In case someone tries to throw you in a lake again? We can learn together. Get a little house on the beach. - Mm. - What about you two? Oh, I don't know. Probably check myself into rehab for purse addiction. Will you see each other? See each other? Uh, you mean, like... - As friends. - Oh, right. Yeah. - Yeah. I mean, you know... - Of course. We're friends. Charles: Yeah, I mean, she's gonna want me hanging Yeah, he's not gonna want me hanging around so we'll just see each other when we see each other. Yes. Mexico. Here's to new beginnings. Welcome to Mexico. Sorry, entry is not granted. - What do you mean? - Sorry, entry is not granted. What? Do it again. Is it charged? Is it on? Try it again. Try this eye. Sorry, entry is not granted. What's happening? I don't... e2 and I have identical retina scans. Charles: Please, can you just let her through? Robot: Sorry, entry is not granted. Elaine: Just stop fucking saying that. - Come on. - Sorry, entry is not granted. Charles: I can't even bribe the bastard. He won't make an exception. He's programmed not to. - Go. - But you'll be arrested. The woman you love and who loves you is waiting for you... And I'm not leaving Elaine. Now go. You're still my robot. Good-bye, my friend. Thanks for showing me how to be a human. Good-bye, Charles. Thank you. Welcome to Mexico. You stupid cunt. Hey! Hands in front of you now where I can see 'em! Now! - Humans. - Beats an eye poke test. All right, where are they? Both of your hands out. You're under arrest. You're going away for a long time. Hang on. What exactly are they being Well, having robot "fac-sea-miles," obviously. And where's your evidence? Do you have videos, prints, mugshots? No, no. They blew up my jail. - Agent: Let's go. - Sheriff: No, no, no, no. You are an idiot. Never call me again. We're out of here. So, I, uh... I guess we're not going to jail for the rest of our lives? It would seem so. So what do you want to do now? This. My darlings, congratulations. I'm so happy for you. - Thanks, mum. - But where'd you go? We thought you'd got cold feet. Oh, no, we just... Just wanted a little bit of quiet time together before the chaos of the wedding. Oh, honey, lovely. Oh, god. What happened to Ted Jr.? Mother: Oh, it's his allergy. Some asshole put Nutella in the wagyu sliders. Be right back. Oh, poor little Teddy with his fat little face. Oh, do you see his big little ear? Schulman. Good evening, sir. I gather that you met my wife kiki yesterday. I did, and she actually grabbed my ass pretty aggressively, sir. - You're fired. - I know. Best day of my life. Who says that when a womanizer and a gold-digger get together things wouldn't turn out well for either of them? Hey, lovebirds! You miss your robots yet? - Shut up. - Sorry. Been in the bathroom doing blow with some guy He offered me a job as an architect. - Both: What? - Whatever the fuck that is. - I mean... - Hey, let's fucking party, huh? - Where did you find him? - I have no idea. ♪ Something in the middle ♪ ♪ of the side of the store ♪ ♪ got your attention and asked for more ♪ ♪ I was excited to be part of your world ♪ ♪ to belong, to be lost ♪ ♪ to be mostly the two of us ♪ ♪ something I was stealing ♪ ♪ for no reason at all ♪ ♪ they hang me higher than a disco ball ♪ ♪ but you talked them into letting me go ♪ ♪ it's no Picasso, Michelangelo ♪ ♪ something 'bout the jewels you wear ♪ ♪ shiny, shiny bangles on your wrists ♪ ♪ and at the masquerade ball ♪ ♪ you feel trapped in a vault, in an empty aquarium ♪ ♪ if suddenly you're out of the woods ♪ ♪ then inside of an alley, you're out of words ♪ ♪ well, I thought it was radium at first ♪ ♪ just because of you ♪ ♪ these things I have to go through ♪ ♪ is it so bad? ♪ ♪ Is it so true? ♪ ♪ Is it still you? ♪ ♪ Just because of you ♪ ♪ these things I have to go through ♪ ♪ it's more than that, we're chained ♪ ♪ there's no one else to blame for us two ♪ ♪ some things, they don't matter, ♪ they stole that money from a homeless girl ♪ ♪ the truth, we're all to blame ♪ ♪ their lies and moral consequences ♪ ♪ we started at the end of the line ♪ ♪ to end up giving up to a couple, who cares? ♪ ♪ When you talked me into letting you go ♪ ♪ no more coral on the atoll ♪ ♪ something about how hard you learned ♪ ♪ kamikaze in a hopeless world ♪ ♪ do you remember the last time you laughed ♪ ♪ and I laughed, and you left, and I left ♪ ♪ send me on the lonely other side of the world ♪ ♪ with a couple of guys and no alphabet ♪ ♪ put two and two together ♪ ♪ we'll make it last forever ♪ ♪ just because of you ♪ ♪ these things I have to go through ♪ ♪ is it so bad? ♪ ♪ Is it so true? ♪ ♪ Is it still you? ♪ ♪ Just because of you ♪ ♪ these things I have to go through ♪ ♪ it's more than that, we're chained ♪ ♪ there's no else to blame for us two ♪ ♪ Just because of you ♪ ♪ these things I have to go through ♪ ♪ is it so bad? ♪ ♪ Is it so true? ♪ ♪ Is it still you? ♪ ♪ Just because of you ♪ ♪ these things I have to go through ♪ ♪ it's more than that, we're chained ♪ ♪ there's no else to blame for us two ♪
