- Mommy? - What? Tell me a story. I already told you all the stories I know, Karen. Can you read to me from this book? Okay. "Lady Lydia Ashley woke up one morning and the bright sun was stroking her golden hair. It was a glorious day, but her heart was heavy because she had no one to love. She had no one to talk to in the morning, - in the night--" - Mommy? When can I come and live with you? Soon. As soon as I get my money together, Karen. Are you ever gonna get married again?

The stock keeps going down the way it's been going down, we're gonna get a margin call tomorrow we won't be able to meet. Buy some more. I don't want it to drop another eighth. I want you to support that stock and I will worry about tomorrow. You're crazy. I thought you went home. No, I'm here. We had a good day-- very good. Texan went up three points. We sold 200,000. Are you listening to me? Cheryl and I are splitting up. I know, Bob. This has been going on for a month. The woman wants to be free, wants to fuck around. Fuck her. I'm gonna be free myself. You gotta snap out of this. Things like this happen. How would you know? You want to know what really happened? A month ago... I couldn't find some of the papers I'd been working on over the weekend, so at lunchtime, I went home unexpectedly. Want to hear the rest? Do you want to tell me? Don't worry. This is where it gets good. It was the maid's day off. So I came home and I went in the door and there was Cheryl performing fellatio on some 20-year-old kid right there on the living room sofa. I'm sorry. Remember when we were kids out in Great Neck hustling our asses to make a few bucks? Yeah. I knew what life was all about then. It was about beating the system. And dreams. What do we dream about now? Bobby, don't drink any more. To you-- a great money machine, without whom I would never have all I have today. What do I have, Johnny? You don't get it, do you? It's not about money. What are we doing here? We're on the cutting edge. We're the ones who take the chances. Right. To capitalism-- greatest system in the world. The system in which somehow only a real scumbag makes it all the way to the top. All of this because your wife was going down on some 20-year-old kid? You low-life son of a bitch. No, don't-- leave me alone! Shit. Man: Get out, bitch! - Ow, ow! - You're over the hill. Jerk. Give me my shoes. Give me my eyeglasses. This is the last time, you hear me? The last time. That's it!

Hey, you dead? They already took the money. God, you scared me. Sorry. I was just looking for an ID. What are you doing here? I got mugged. I'll call an ambulance. - No. - Why, the police after you? No, no, I just don't want to go to a hospital. Why not? Looks like you could use it. Can I have a glass of water? Who are you? Just someone who needs a bit of help. Well, I gotta go. All I run into lately is weirdos. I'm not a weirdo, Christ! Christ, I'm not a weirdo! Doesn't anybody care about anybody anymore?! Christ. Ah. You just gonna lay there? I'm gonna call the cops. No, don't. Please. Look, I live in this building, see? I don't want any bodies on my front doorstep. A glass of water, wash my face. That's all I want. Why don't you want me to call the cops? I just want to go home quietly. So be quiet and go home. Look, while we've been talking here, I could have gone up to your apartment, I could have had a drink of water. I'll only take five minutes of your time. I'll-- I'll even pay you. With what? A check. They left my checkbook. Don't take checks. - That's a mistake. - In this neighborhood? All right, just let me lie here and die in peace. I want you to know I never let anybody come up here. Well, it's not very fancy, but welcome to my little sanctuary. Nice place. Thank you. I don't have much time to fix it up. Here. Thank you. Can I have some more? Sure. Thank you. Your daughter? Oh, yeah. That's Karen. She's eight. She's got my eyes and her father's hair. She's pretty. Thank you. Smart too. Look, the bathroom's in here. You can wash up and I'll get you a towel to wash up with. Here. Thanks. So you all right? Thanks for taking me in. It's okay. You're a kind person. How would you know? You're helping me out. May not mean I'm so kind. It probably means I'm stupid. No. No, it shows that you've got good instincts about people. But I don't. I have terrible instincts about people. I always pick the wrong ones. What do you do? I-- I'm... between jobs. Ah? What kind of jobs? Modeling mostly, but I'm thinking of getting into something more serious now. Like what? Real estate. Or interior design. You? Me? Ahem, I'm a businessman. Hard times? No. No, not at all. I just-- I had a long, miserable day. I-- I couldn't sleep and I took a walk. These guys jumped me. I used to be so sure of everything. Now I don't know. You divorced? I was married once. It's a sad story. Karen wasn't even-- why am I telling you this? I said five minutes. I'm telling you my life story. It's all right, it's all right. I was just curious. Okay. I was 26 years old. His name was Bobby. He was Italian. And we were both waiting on tables in Greenwich Village. And I was initially attracted to him because he was the only waiter in the restaurant who wasn't gay. And... he was the only man who ever proposed to me. You don't have to tell me this. Hmm. So one night we went to a party in Long Island and we drank too much. And I was thinking that we shouldn't be drinking and driving at the same time because my father was an alcoholic and that's the way he died. And sure enough, the next thing you know, I'm lying on this stretcher in the elevator at St. Vincent's, and my mother's looking down at me and she's saying, "Everything always happens to you." Bobby died like that. Windshield punctured his lung. So... how about you? Nothing like that ever happened to me. Do you want some more water? Listen, you don't have any coffee, do you? Coffee. Coffee? Yeah, any kind. Nope. Tea? Here. Don't you have a family? No. No wife? No. - Well, you must have friends. - Sure. That's important. Everybody should have somebody. I guess my five minutes are up. What's so funny? I have known a lot of married men, but you are definitely single. How'd you know? Something's sticking out. Really? I hadn't noticed. Here. Well, let's just clean your collar up a little bit and we'll have you looking good as new. I like you. You're pretty. You think I'm pretty? This is crazy. It is for me. I mean this is really crazy. Man: Bambi, open up! I said open up, bitch! No. Ah! I've been looking all over for you, Bambi. So you found me. Now what? So where is the fucking money? There is no money. Look, I was beaten up. The guy had a gun. He almost killed me-- - You're lying! - I am not lying! - And I'm gonna get another job. - Oh, yeah? Yes, I am getting a regular job. - Is that right? - That's right, I'm through with this. Oh, Slim's gonna love this shit. Well, I don't care. I tell you what, Bambi-- I've always liked you, so I'm gonna be real nice to you. And I'm gonna give you one more chance. Okay? Ow! No! Don't do that! Oh! Am I getting through to you, slut? You're getting through to me! Why don't you leave her alone? - Who the fuck is this? - Nobody. Nobody? He just came here for some water, okay? Yeah, okay. Who the fuck are you, Jack? - It's really irrelevant. - Is it? You been with my bitch, man. And you ain't going no-fucking-where till you give me my money. Leave him alone. He's not a trick. Well, if he ain't a trick, what is he? Your father? - I'm waiting, my man. - I haven't got any money. I already got mugged tonight. Hey, if he ain't got no fucking money, what is he doing in here, huh? I told you, I don't know. Look, the two of you got some very important things to discuss. I gotta-- Will you leave him alone?! Ah! Who the fuck is he? How many times do I have to tell you? I don't know! - He came here for some water. - Bitch. You touch me one more time and I will kill you! Do you understand me? Get his gun. It's in the jacket! Okay, Earl, you take the money belt off now! You're fucking dead. How many times have you told me that? Take it off now! Drop it on the floor! Hurry up! Drop it! Now! Get out of here! You're dead, bitch. Now! You're fucking dead. Now! Ah! Probably gonna come here and kill me. I wouldn't doubt it. 2,000. It's chicken feed to what they've taken from me. I worked for those guys for three years. Gave 'em all my money. Made $200 a night, dancing in the club, work, tips, clients, whatever else you want to imagine. Good night-- 500, seven nights a week. That means you've given them about a quarter of a million dollars. Ha. Is that what it comes to? Yeah, that's assuming, of course, that you had very few good nights. Don't count 'em. Without compounding interest, I'd say you're a lousy businesswoman. Yeah, well, I flunked math. Well, listen, thanks again. - What? - Thanks again. - Where you going? - Back to civilization. Ah, come to Mama, come to Mama, come to Mama. Yes, yes, yes, come on, come on. Bingo. Okay, okay, now, let's see. Wires, wires. Come here, come here! - Come on, can you move any slower? - Hey! What the fuck are you doing with my car? - What do you want now? - Bags-- please help me. - Please! - Man: Get outta the car! Give me my jacket! Come on, move your ass! What are you two doing with my car?! - Let's go. - Get out of there! Get out! Come back here with that car! That was my landlord. Damn it, he's still got my $500 deposit - and a month's security. - You've got his car. Don't worry about it. He'll get it back. He's ripped me off so many times, the creep. He and everybody else. A lot of men. Maybe it's the business you're in. Maybe. Maybe you'd like to be the one to save me. Looks like I'm the one who needs to be saved. Just drop me off over here, okay? Bambi: What's the matter? You scared of me? You're scared of me, are you? Shouldn't I be? - You are so weird. - Me? You're the one that's wearing sunglasses in the middle of the night. Is that what's bothering you? The fact that I'm wearing sunglasses? It happens to make the world look better. Do you mind? Does it offend you? You like music? I don't care. Bambi: I love music. Ha. Makes me happy. Mmm. And you are not a happy man. John: You're the expert. What's the matter? I'm not smart enough for you? Is that it? Maybe you're right. But I have fucked some of the best minds in this town. And just maybe it has rubbed off on me-- just maybe. Maybe this is the closest that you have come to knowing what a Nobel Prize scientist says just before he comes. I only sell my body. What do you sell? I don't sell anything. Are you sure you don't sell a little bit of your soul? - Shut up. - No. I touched a nerve. Good. Good, it shows that you're human. Good. You know, you have so much style. It comes with the territory. It's priceless. You couldn't afford me, mister. Hmm, I wouldn't touch you if you paid me, bimbo. My name is Bambi. Whatever. Just stop the car. Fuck. Look, I picked you up from the gutter, I took you into my home, I gave you warmth, I protected you like a child, I opened my heart to you. You even said you liked me, all right? Now you're dumping on me. This is why I don't trust men! Do you understand? This is why I don't trust men. Now get out of my car! Listen, um... everything you said about me is-- is true. I'm sorry about all of this. Good night. I need your help! What for? To pick up my daughter and get her things. - At 2:00 A.M.? - Yeah. We gotta leave town first thing in the morning and these people are gonna be coming after me. You're crazy. I'm not crazy, I just can't do it alone. Where is she? At my mother's-- Jamaica. Jamaica? I just thought I'd ask. The way you asked me for some water. Mother, you're up. - They took her! - Who? How should I know? These men you're whoring for! Karen? Did you call the police? They said they'd kill her if I called anybody. I called you. You weren't home. Who are you? Why didn't you look after her a little? She can't take care of herself. What are you doing? I thought you needed my help. I don't need your help and you can't help me. Now come on, get out. Wait, wait, what are you gonna do? I'm gonna do whatever I have to do. Please, just move. Listen, I have no money. Compliments of Earl. No. Why? What's the matter with you? Why are we wasting our time arguing? Okay, suit yourself. But don't say I didn't warn you. John: What the hell are you doing? Slow down and calm down, all right? - Could you just do that? - I can't calm down. It's my baby. She is eight years old. She probably feels very abandoned and desperate. Do you understand that? All right, let's go. No, you can't go in there with me. Look, hold this. If I'm not down in 10 minutes, call the cops. Come on, it's Bambi! Open the door. Come on, it's Bambi! Yeah? Uh, I'm looking for Bambi. - Who are you? - I'm a friend of hers. What do you want? To come in. Wait here. Step inside. Hands on the wall. Come with me. ♪ Mean streak ♪ You got a mean streak... Hey, you got a bill? I'll take you to heaven. Already been there. Hey. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. - You really want to quit me. Is that it? - Mm-hmm. This a friend of yours, Bambi? No. Well, that's what he says. I found him lying in the street. Who is he? I don't know. Didn't I tell you never to bring a stranger to this place? - John: She had no choice. - Shut up! Well, well, well, well, well. So you brought yourself a friend, huh? I didn't bring him. He's been clinging on to me all night like a leech. Go shut the door. Where's your daughter? I don't know. No! So that's your type? An elegant gentleman, eh? A pussy? A faggot? He's not a faggot. You're really dragging my ass up a wall, you know that, woman? You know it? Eh? Where is my daughter? Oh, God. She wants to know where her daughter is. - I don't even hear a "please." - Please. You know I saved this bitch's life after her husband got killed. She had nothing-- nothing at all. I got her a job. I got her off her feet and on her back. And how does she thank me? She comes in and tells me she's quitting. You know what? It's gonna cost me money. Who's gonna make it up to me? You? - I'll pay you back. - How? I'll get a job. She'll get a job! Doing what? A secretary? A waitress, maybe? Huh? I'm gonna work hard. I can work hard. Oh, yeah? Well, let's see just how hard you can work, - Bambi legs! Huh? Huh? - Oh! You'll get you a job, huh? Huh?! Here, men. Oh, yeah. - Yeah, this is what you like. - I want my daughter! - I-- give me Karen! - Take it off. Take it off, Bambi. This is what you really love. - Ah! Give me my daughter! - This is what you really love. - Please! - Yeah, this is what you love, eh? This is what it's about, huh, Bambi? - I want my daughter! - Yeah, baby! - No! - Quit on me, bitch, huh? Quit on me, will you?! Yeah! Well, this is your job. This is what you're about. This is your work. You want to work hard? I'll show you how to work hard. You son of a bitch! You son of a bitch! Well, well, well, well, well. Man's not a zombie after all, huh? You got something to say, mister? - This guy's got guts. - Bambi: My daughter. He deserves special treatment. You're a worthless pimp and pusher. - You're nothing. - No, no, no, no, no. My friend, no. No, I'm a businessman. I sell people exactly what they want and nothing else. And I always tell the truth, even when I'm gonna kill someone. You took a big chance coming in here, mister. So what? You like laying your life on the line, don't you, dude? I'm a gambler. What kind of gambling you do? Anything, as long as the stakes are high enough. Oh, really? What are you, a cop? No. Then how do you make your living? I already told you. I'm a gambler. Woman: He's a cop. He's a gambler. I like that. I like that-- a gambler. Well, how much you got on you, Mr. Gambler? 2,000 bucks. That's not a lot for a fancy gambler like you. How much is it for a pimp like you? Well, it's not a lot either. Except isn't your two grand my two grand? Earl got himself whupped by a pussy. Ain't that something? It's her money. I'm holding it for her. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, my man. You don't understand the way things are. She makes the bread, but I own it. So give it over. - I'm gonna waste him, Slim. - Waste him? Waste him? No, I like this dude. No, he's a gambler like me. Besides, we share the same woman, don't we? No, this man deserves a break. So you say you got two grand on you, huh? Okay. I wanna give you a bet. Six-to-one odds in your favor. If you win, you double your money. If you lose, you die. Take it or leave it. I'll take it. Let's see the money. Well, give it here. She'll hold it. Sure, why not? We're gonna get out of here with Karen and with the money. No. The only way we'll ever get out of here is if you've got a gun on him. You forgot something. Oh, yeah? What's that? Your money. Count it. I trust you. Everything okay? So far. No. Oh, no, chump. You don't get to hold the gun. Just in case. Veronica. I mean, if you're gonna die, you might as well die at the hands of a beautiful woman, that right? Is that good with you? I'll enjoy blowing this fucker away. Well, let's play. Bambi: No. Do you want a cigarette? I don't smoke. I love this dude. He even watches his health, huh? Men: Oh, dang. Aw! You're a lucky man, cop. Who are you, mister? I'm a man with $4,000. What do you say? Double or nothing? This freak's a flake. Now you got a death wish, mister. Maybe. Why don't we just blow him away?! Yeah, why not? What do you do, huh? I'm a speculator. I make money playing against the odds. What are we waiting for, pimp? Do it! - Oh! - Men: Dang it. - He's a fruitcake. - Shit. Man, you're crazy. Ready again? $8,000, double or nothing. What do you say? No! Stop this! I want you to pick up the money and I want you to be quiet. You understand? Pick up the money and be quiet. Okay? Good. All right. All right. What do you say we go all the way this time? Hmm? One last deal. $8,000 against the girl. What do you say? Ha. Against the girl? That's right. If I lose, you get the money. All of it. If I win, you let both of them go. The money against the girl, huh? That's right. Okay, you got yourself a deal. - Oh, man. - Bring her here. Wait, wait, wait. Wait, you're not going to bring an eight-year-old girl in here to see your brains splattered all over the wall, now, are you? Let her wait outside with her mother. Oh, no, that's not part of the deal, my friend. You have me, you have the money. What are you afraid of? I'm scared of nothing. Bring the girl down here. - Karen! - Mommy! - Oh, look what we got here! - Let her go! Oh, now, look at this little thing, huh? You got a kiss for Uncle Slim, huh? Come on, give me a kiss. Mommy! Oh, honey. Oh, love, it's gonna be okay. Get them the hell out of here. I believe we got a bet. What is your name, anyway? John. Ah. What kind of a speculator are you, really, mister? Hmm? I play the market. You mean Wall Street? Of course. I should have known. Money, power, sex. That's what it's all about, isn't it, huh? I really don't know. Where you from, John? Danbury, Connecticut? Westport? Princeton? You take a guy like me, see, at 19 years old, sticks up a lousy liquor store for a stinking $24, and they lay 10 years on him in a maximum security penitentiary. And then there's a guy like you, rips people off for hundreds of millions of dollars, and if he's unlucky enough to get caught, they send him up to one of them Pennsylvania country clubs where he can watch color TV and cook gourmet food. I guess life is unfair, huh? Some of us just get unlucky, huh? Veronica? Do it. Man. I'm walking away right now. You'll never get away with her, partner. To me, she's a woman. For you, she'll always be a whore. Wait, wait, wait. Let him go, let him go. Go, go! John: Listen, um... why don't we just stop for a few minutes? You okay? Yeah. Here. Put this on. Ha. Oh. You might catch a cold. - Cold. - Yes. Okay. You must think I'm dirt. No. All the men. Those kind of men. Doesn't matter. I feel like dirt. It's over. I just wanted to tell you something. Nobody ever... stood up for me the way you did last night. You-- you risked your life for me. You know sometimes I-- I wonder what we're all doing here. I look at my life from a distance and it seems like we're all ants going around in circles on the sand. And someone could just come along and just stamp you out. Last night I felt like that. It's all right. By the way, what is your name? My real name? Melanie Rose. Melanie Rose? Hmm. That's a real pretty name. Hmm. I like that. No! No! Bambi: Ah! Ah! Tell me you're okay. Slim: I should have never let you go. Well, well, well, it's just me and you now. Huh, partner? Huh? Let's see how lucky you are now. Go get her. We're going back. Funny, huh? How most women will betray you, huh, John? When you need them the most. - Go get her, Bambi. - No. - Go get her, God damn it! - It's over between us. - Don't you understand? - It's never over. Never! What do you want to shoot him for? Shoot me. - You're such a big man. Shoot me. - Mommy, I'm scared! No, come on, go ahead! Shoot me! Come on, you're a man! Shoot me if it makes you so happy! Happy? Happy? Shit. Mmm. Ha. Where am I? Brooklyn. Brooklyn? Private place. Nobody knows we're here. You just had surgery. Took a slug out of you. How you feel? Where's Karen? Other room. What day is it? Mmm. Monday. 6:00 A.M. Monday? You've been kind of out of it for 48 hours. Monday. - Did you deposit the money? - Nope. How-- The banks are closed. You can deposit money anytime. I don't have the money anymore. What happened? I spent it all. On what? On your surgery. On this place. These people risk a lot. They could lose their practice. - Hey. - What? I'm gonna get you something to eat. Come here a minute. What? Come here. Was I asleep all night? Out like a log. Where were you? I was here. Where? Sitting in this chair. Huh. I must have been dreaming. What? I must have been dreaming someone was lying next to me all night long. In the dream... she had her arms all around me. What'd she look like? She had long blonde hair, legs like a deer. And her body was warm. Bambi: I was cold. John: She had beautiful, sad eyes. That's so sad. Are you still cold? No. Come here. Well... This is good-bye. I have to go. I don't have to go. I do. John? Yes? Is that really your name? John? Yes. I like it. John. Am I ever gonna see you again? Guess not. What's the matter? I'm not the knight in shining armor you think I am. Yes, you are. You take care of yourself, okay? You too. I've been meaning to ask you something. What? What were you doing in Times Square? I was looking for a hooker. 50 bucks for 20 minutes. No questions. Well, you found one. No. That's not what I found. Thank you for saving my kid and getting her back to me. Hi. You sleep good? Where's John? John went home. - When's he coming back? - He isn't. He left his coat. Wait a minute. There's something in the pocket. Give it to me, sweetheart. Jill, I'm running late. Anything I should know? Harvey, how many P&C we got left? Harvey: 100,000. All right, sell 'em all. Jack, what's Prudent trading at? Jack: 7 1/4. All right, hold on to 'em. Betty? Betty, how we doing over at Pep Co? Harvey, Jack. Everybody on Spectra, Nutra, MNSP-- I want you to sell everything we've got. Sell everything we've got. - Want something to eat? - No, no. - Betty, talk to me. What's going on? - We're getting fucked here. The market keeps dropping. What do you want me to do? I want you to sell everything we've got. Got it? Sell everything we've got. Mommy, tell me a story. I told you all the stories I know, Karen. Man: Market's closed. Well, how'd we do? We made a killing on Sunrise. Risky but profitable. We're in the business of taking risks. That's why we're in the game. Woman: Who is it?! John. Shit. Who? John. Uh, I'm looking for the woman who used to live here, Melanie. I don't know any Melanie. Bambi. Bambi! Her name is Bambi. Bambi doesn't live here anymore. There are no pictures in this magazine. There aren't supposed to be. It's a business magazine. - Yuck. - Don't say that word. We are having dinner, young lady. What are we having? Well, it is the specialty of the house. I have been working six hours on it. Then why is it burnt? Oh, Karen. Oh, Karen. Oh. Oh. Oh! - Mom, look! - What? - It's him! - Oh. I'm having a crisis. Who? Mom, it's him. Listen, kid, I'm sorry, but this is all you're getting for dinner. Mom! Oh, my God. Wow. John: Hello? Hi. How are you? Well... I'm fine. How are you? Very well. So... Listen, why don't we-- how about dinner? I was hoping you'd say that. Um, how about Tuesday, 7:30? You got it. I know a nice little place. Well, another day, another million. You still here? I thought you had a dinner date. I'm still here. Huh. - You should get married, John. - Mmm. It'd give you a reason to get out of here at night, someone to cuddle up to, to discuss property settlement and alimony with. Hmm. Who would marry me? Who wouldn't? What's the matter, John? What happened? John: I blew it. Radical! You blew what? I thought I had more courage. You have a lot of courage. Are you kidding? Who else would gamble $20 million of their own money in one day? No, no, no, not where it counts. If you want my input on this, you're going to have to tell me what the hell you're talking about. Right. This person, someone I met recently... The dinner date? Right. Well, this person... I don't really know much about. And is this person a businessperson or is it-- It's a woman. Well, that's a step in the right direction. I don't know. She's not the kind of woman I should be seen with. Why not? Does she work for a competing firm? She comes from another planet. Worked for E.T.! A wonderful, strange character. She gets thrown from cars without her clothes on. What are her good points? Those are her good points. Bambi! Bambi with the long, lovely legs. How you-- Where you going? Hey, babe. Hello, Mother. It's Melanie. Melanie? Melanie, your daughter-- Melanie. Well, what did you do to yourself? Can I come in? Yeah. How you feeling, Mother? Tired, as always. I brought you some money. Ha. That kind of money I don't want. It's not that kind of money. I'm through with all of that, Mother, for good. I wish I could believe that. Well, ha... It's true. I'm-- I'm taking Karen to California. At last I feel ready to take care of her. California? Yeah. It seems like a good place to get a fresh start. So far away. Yeah. I think it'll do us good. Mother? Please look at me. I am well aware that I have not been what you've wanted me to be. But I'm trying to change. I really am. What do you think? I wish that I knew how to work it out between us. I wish I knew how to make you proud of me. Bambi: I'd like to see Mr. Stratton, please. - Woman: Do you have an appointment? - No. Mr. Stratton doesn't see anybody without an appointment. Here you go. Thank you. Tell him Melanie's here. Pardon me? Melanie Rose. I'm here to see him. No, I'm afraid that's impossible. Mr. Stratton is very busy. Can somebody else help you? No. Is there a telephone number you'd like to leave? No, no number. Hello, Stratton Inc. Can I help you? Man: John, what should I do about Sun Co-- John? What? Sun Co-- it's down... ...and it's still going south. Mm-hmm. We're stuck with half a million shares, John. What do you want me to do? Woman: The market is collapsing, John! The blue chips are getting killed. You've got to do something! Are you there? Yes. - I'm going to sell. - No, wait. John, come on, we gotta move, man! The Dow is down over 60. We've dropped $9 million in the past three hours. - Maybe more. - We're losing our pants. It's a fucking nightmare. Well, come on, John! You gotta decide. We can just sit and do nothing. Bambi. You stood me up. I couldn't make it. Oh, you two know each other. Anyway, I just came here to make sure that you could get this. And now if you'll excuse me, I have a plane to catch. Jill: Is that the girl who gets thrown out of cars - without her clothes on? - Right. I thought so. She just went out to the elevator. John! What do you want to do about the market? Harvey, you've been in the market longer than I have. I have complete confidence in you. You'll think of something. Now's the time to buy. Bambi! Bambi! - Bambi. - My name is Melanie. Wait. What do you want? I want to help you. You want to help me? How? Look, you need money. What for? To live. For you, for Karen, for her education. I can get a job in California. I've always taken care of myself. - Can I go now? - California? Melanie, look! I don't want your money, all right? What do you want? What I want, you don't have. What is it? It doesn't make any difference now. You're smart, you're tough, you're a beautiful woman. There's nothing in this world that you can't have. We'll find out. - Melanie. - What? You just can't walk away like this. Why can't I? You walked away from me. You never left an address, a phone number. You never even told me your name. You never called me. I called you. You made a date with me, you stood me up. Why can't I walk away from you?! Because I need you. Why? I don't know why. You wear oversized sunglasses, you wear a tight orange dress, you have a totally screwed-up sense of reality. That's not enough. I love you. You love me? Really? - Yes. - Are you positive? You love me? Me? Ah! We have to make love right now. - Now? - Right now! Everyone's got to get screwed on Wall Street sooner or later. - Will you marry me?! - I will. - Can we have babies? - Yes. - We'll live in New Jersey. - Okay, if you want to. Ah! Oh!
