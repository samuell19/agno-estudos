The two masters of the Ti Hu Fortress. We bring to the Lords of the great Lai palace... greetings from all our men at our fortress... today on your 60th birthday. Thank you. Very kind. Very kind. We hope you enjoy prosperity and a long life. Thank you. The palace maidens will pay their respects. Thank you. Thank you. All enjoy yourselves. Thank you. Off you go. Hey, I managed to get some wine from the kitchen. Let's have a drink. Plenty here. Come on. Have a seat. Chin-Chin. Chin-Chin. Where are you going to? Stay for a drink. She's a strange girl. So what? Let her go. She always thinks she's too good for us. So just forget her and have a drink. Here. I'll pour for you. Sau Lai! Nobody knows where you go, Young Master... except me. I knew he'd be waiting for me. Why so quiet? What's the matter? Why are you staring? Get out! Out of my sight. - You're angry because I'm late? - Who cares? I'm sorry. Don't be mad. Is this blood? Have you been fighting? I've had bloodstains before. There was even some of your blood there once. - You've slept with someone else? - So? Why do you care? You're only some maid. I can take you when I feel like, without asking. But you do know, though, I'm pregnant, and it's your child. Who says that it's mine? You? You any proof? Leave! Yes, I should leave. You're a beast! My Lord Lai, you're a righteous man. Everyone here has the greatest respect for the Lai Clan. Oh, look, your son's here. Sau Lai, where have you been? It is your father's birthday. Or have you forgotten? What? You still here? Still guzzling wine and free food? - Sau Lai, you mad? - No, I'm not. I'm just fed up with parasites. Gone. It's all right. Don't get angry. It's late. We'll go now. Listen. It's late now and it's time that we went. Our host needs his rest. Yes, that's right. Let's all get off to our homes now, shall we? All right. And what are you waiting for? Just get out. How dare you. Disgracing me. Out! Get out! You should go, not me. You're my only son. But I'd rather have none than one like you. Out! Out of this house! Everyone should get out of this house... except for me. And Why? Because if they don't, they'll all die. And why die with you, except in my case? And why will they die if they stay? Because someone is coming here. Who? Fifteen years. It's exactly fifteen years. Now they've come. Those Killer Bees are a deadly bunch. Where they go, no one survives. I got the word yesterday. - You didn't tell me? - I told Mother. We decided you should enjoy your 60th birthday feast. And I was certain that they'd wait until tonight. That's right. Fifteen years. It was on this very same date. That was when I destroyed them. I just regret I didn't wipe the lot out. And now I shall have to pay for that mistake. You have to leave. You can't stay. They will kill you. I'll stay. Dad, listen. I am your son. I'll stay. Dad, listen. I am your son. That's why you must go. We can't let them wipe out the Lai family name. Don't you worry about that. A girlfriend of mine is pregnant. - Who's that? - It's Chin-Chin. - Chin-Chin. Where is she? - She's left here. But bearing your child. She wouldn't leave. But I didn't give her any choice, though. My God. You thought of everything, including the family name. I hurt her terribly, though. But I'd no choice. But how will she take care of herself? I asked Chen Chun to help her. I know you regard him as a good friend... but you haven't known him long. But real friendship doesn't just depend on time. It depends on trust. Right. And I believe... Chen Chun is a real trustworthy friend. And I'm proud... that our only child is so filial, you're such a good son. Mother. I should have known. You should have told me. Let's get ready. Sau Lai and I are not going to leave you. You're willing to die? You remember... what we said at our wedding altar... thirty years ago? I do. We swore by the gods... that we would stay together till death do us part. And we now have to fulfill our promise. But even in the next life we'll still be joined. Good. With such a wife and a son as I have here... I am proud to die. Tell everyone, gather their things. Leave immediately. My Lord, we realize something bad is coming... or you wouldn't ask us to leave. You've always been most kind to us... so we don't want to leave you when you're in trouble. That would be wrong. You're right. There is trouble, and it will happen soon. But it's not your problem. My Lord, what is this? We're all your good friends. We'll help in any way that we can. Now, look, the people coming here... are a bunch of determined killers... and none of you would have a chance. Right. Listen to me. I'm grateful to you for offering. Please go now. My Lord, please allow us, your friends, to help you. My Lord, it'll be a great honor. - Please, my Lord. - Get up. Get up. Get up. Right. If a man does have to die, and with such friends, it's an honor. Look. Dad, look. - They're here. - My Lord, who are they? They're the Killer Bee Gang. - Return my hand! - Dad... Return my hand! Return my hand. Return my hand! It's mine. Dad, look. Return our lights! Hold it. We've got to keep calm. Ignore all the tricks. I never believed in witchcraft. Lai Tifone, a debt you've owed fifteen years. Tonight we'll be paid off. Sau Lai! Kill them all. So many... and they're all dead. But still, though, who will pay for them? You. I see you're alive, but your parents are both dead. Why don't you die? Because I have to kill you. Right. Push it in, then you'll have killed me. - That's what you want. - You're right. It is. Just to avenge my parents. You feel that way too? Well, then you know why I came here. But your parents deserved it. Deserved it? Why? Because they were bandits. You know that. Murderers. Oh, they were murderers? And your father? My father was a kind man. You can ask anyone. They'll all tell you. Someone who tries to kill a five-year-old girl... would you call him kind? If so, then that's a strange kindness. Five-year-old girl? Look here. That scar was a present from your kind father. If you still think your father was a good, kindly man... then you just push that sword in. Why are you staring at me? Kill me. I'm not Chin-Chin. Take a good look. It's me. It's you. Sure, it's me. Who do you think brought you here? - Why didn't you kill me? - Well, you didn't kill my family. You spared me. I spared you. - What do you want? - I want you to live... and suffer a long time. Because your parents are both dead, you'll want revenge... but can't get it because you can't match me. I could kill you anytime. So you can suffer all the time, awake, asleep... always afraid of me... worrying that I'll come. - You are vicious? - Vicious? You'd be too if you'd suffered like me. But now you're going to learn what it's like. Hey, miss. Well, now, where you going to? Let me go! Let's go! I'm not Sau Lai. I'm Chen Chun. What are you doing here? You must be his girlfriend, Chin-Chin. What's wrong? - Where's Sau Lai? - Please don't mention his name. Had a fight? Don't cry. Tell me about it. Come. I just don't understand it. How he could have treated you like this. I'd have never thought he could do that. I'm going to take you back, make him explain. I won't go. I'll never go back. Well, no matter what, you'll be taken care of. Now, get some rest. I shall go out and get you some new clothes and some food. I don't want to stay in this place. I want to forget the past. Please let's leave. Leave? But where to? I don't care where. Anywhere. Evening, sir. A room? We have very nice rooms. Very clean. - I'll need two rooms. - Yes, of course. This way. I'll take the horse. This way, sir. You may be planning to spend your life here? - If I am, so what? - You needn't. Your Chin-Chin has gone off with your good friend. - You lie. - You lost your home and your parents. So if I were you, I wouldn't waste time on a girl. Not worth it. You're not me. I'm a man. - Oh, no. You're no man. - What am I? You're a beast. - You're a beast. - I'm a beast? I'm a beast. Where have you been? I'll never let you go. All you think of is your Chin-Chin. I don't know you three men, so what do you want? We've been paid 500 gold bars. That's why we're here. BY Whom? By a very good friend of yours, but one whom you betrayed. Well, now, let's see you get away now. Well, you got him? Of course. When you hire the Bloody Rain Gang, the job gets done. I've never had to hire paid killers before. I still don't like the idea. This time I had no choice. You bastard, where's our goods you stole? I ought to cut your treacherous heart out. God, not him. Not him? My God, you got the wrong man. Wrong man? Who are you? Why are you in Chen Chun's house? Talk, or I'm going to kill you. You made the mistake, so why kill me? Let him go. Not his fault. Pay us. - Pay what? - Five hundred bars. For your mistake we should pay? But it wasn't our fault. You wanted the man in this house... and this man was the only one in there. You wanted him alive, we did just that. He's alive. Pay them. Hey, he's not the one you want? - Of course not. - Then we'll take him. But Why? Because he killed a Bloody Rain man. So by our rules, the man has to die and die slow. And I shall see that happens. Hold it. Well, I don't give a damn what your clan rules are... but you're not killing this man here. - Who says so? - Me. You mean to tell me that for some stranger... you'd oppose our clan? I won't have an innocent man killed through my fault. What if we insist on taking him? Well, then you'll have to get the permission of my spear first. It'll be our pleasure. Right. So you've opposed our clan. You'll have to pay for this with your life. Right. Let's go. Hey, Master Lu, they've left our gold behind. Brother, what about him? We'll take him. Your major hurts have been cured now... and your minor injuries, they'll soon clear up. I am the master of the Dragon Escorts. I've heard of you. The man that we wanted was Chen Chun, not you. - I know that. - Five months passed. We had a big order to escort some rare valuables... the property of the Governor here. Chen Chun was traveling with us. Suddenly he disappeared. And with him the valuables. And you assumed the obvious. Those valuables were quite priceless. If I sold everything that I have, I couldn't pay it. Maybe a coincidence. Maybe it was somebody else stole them. I treated him as a good friend. When a man has been betrayed by a good friend... you've no idea how it hurts you. - There's something you ought to know. - Right. Tell me. The wounds I had weren't by those men. So though I owe you a favor, we need have no further relations. We weren't friends before, and we aren't now. What about the future? I mean, do you think... No, I don't. I don't have any future. Even if we're not friends, you can still stay here for a few days, though. What's the point? I'll go now. Now, wait. You're leaving? Just like that? What do you want? You want to have these clothes back? Hold it. Let him go. Brother, that fella has really got a nerve talking like that. Some people are born stubborn. There's no way we can make him stay here. Sayonara then, my friend. I wronged you. I wronged you. I'm just a beast. Just a lousy beast! Well, now, so a beast can cry. - You again? - I am your shadow. - What do you want? - My God, you're really a coward. We'll bury your parents or look for your betrayer. All you do is sit around and say you're a beast. Well, you flatter yourself. You're lower than a beast. If I do, it's my business. You're supposed to be a man, so why not act like one? Learn to tell good from bad. I've always known that. Well, let me tell you. Your parents are buried. - A friend of yours did it? - Who? Someone whose friendship you've just refused. - Fourth Dragon? - The hand you spurned. Since you know everything, do you know where Chin-Chin is? Sure I know. But why should I tell you? - You... - Me what? You want me to beg? Try it. You just try it. I've never begged you before in my life. I tell you, no matter where she is now, I am going to find her. You only think of her, never look at me. I'm a girl! You don't ever ask my name! I'm Ting Chan Yen! Ting Chan Yen! Good ginseng. It's hard to find here. I cooked this myself. So you drink it up. I'm not hungry. You brood too much, and that isn't very good for your health. Right. Drink it up. Hey, Brother, what are you doing? This is going to be our last trip. May as well take the flag down now. There will be no more Dragon Escort Company. The Fourth Dragon is the last. Hey, don't give up hope. You never know. - Something may happen. - Sure. Look, Boss, there's time. It's two weeks before you have to see the Governor. We may find Chen Chun before that. Sooner than disgrace the Dragon name, I would rather die. Right. But there's still time. Come on. Let's have a drink. Hey, Master, look there. It's him. Brother Lai, we're here. Come on in. Come. Brother Lai, have a seat. I'm glad I found you. So am I, because I like you. Want to have you as a friend. I think we two can get on. I owed you one favor, but now I hear I owe you another. Ask what you want. I shall do it. - So what I ask you, you'll do? - Sure. Right. Sit down. Have a drink. Well done. Here. Drink again. What are you laughing at? - Oh, I just thought of something. - What's that? I just know wherever he is... he's drinking too. Good. Very good. Great. Hey, you can really drink, I must admit. Let's all have a few more. Hey, here's to you. Drink up then. Very good. Come on. Let's fill 'em again, right? Good day, sir. I'm sorry. We're full. - Sit outside, sir? - Yes. Now, sir, what would you like? - Bring some wine. - Oh, right away, sir. Hey, that's finished. Let's have some more. Hey, Brother, this one's finished too. Get some more. We must drink farewell to our friend here. No. I won't go. - You won't go? - I'm staying with you. You're staying with us? Really? Really. You're a strange fella. You refuse to stay when we ask you. Then when we say good-bye, you say you won't go. I guess that I'm just a mule. You mustn't compare yourself with that animal. What's wrong with them? At least mules are faithful. And when you're in trouble, even if you whip them, they won't leave. Fine. Stop there. Come on. Move it. Up. - Master, shall we rest here? - All right. Take care of them. All right, take a rest here. All right. Hey, Brother, look. Brother, that old man was outside the tea house when we left... and was still drinking. Now he's here. How'd he do it? Hey, I'll ask him. Hey, old man. You... Why are you here? Matter of fact, was waiting for you. Well, then, what do you want? I mean, you must want something. I've come to deliver a present to the Fourth Dragon. You've got a present for the boss, right? Come with me. Here. Come on. Well, Master, this old man has a gift for you. How did you know we'd be here? It's a good place to rest. I just assumed that you would. I was right too. What's this gift then? This scroll painting. What's this supposed to mean? You mean you don't know? It's the death of a dragon. - All by yourself? - Of course I've not come alone. I've never seen any of you men before. So in what way have I offended you? Cut out the talk. Give your life to me and the rest can go. Well, at least tell me who you are and in what way I've wronged you. Wronged us? Didn't I warn you opposing my clan would mean the death of you? That's right. Today we collect. So it's the Bloody Rain Clan. Right. - I could do with a bit of practice. - Hold it! As a favor, let me do this. It's my affair. You stay out of this. The reason I'm here is to repay my debts to you. - Just who are you? - The Fifth Dragon. Fifth Dragon? Good. Good. It seems that today we'll kill two Dragons. Here! Brother, take it! - I'll pull it out. - No, leave it. Brother. Brother! How is he? Brother. - Then I still owe you. - You owe me absolutely nothing. I do. I do! Even if you had owed me something once, it's repaid. That's good to know. Well, then, can we be friends now? Afraid we can't. Remember... I'm the Fifth Dragon. Right. We're not just friends. We are brothers. We are good brothers. Brother! Brother! He's only fainted. - I'm indebted to you. - Well, don't be. It wasn't for you. Even if it wasn't for me, you still have my gratitude. Well, now I want to take him with me. Master Lai was wounded on my account. And even though you may have saved his life... I cannot give him to a complete stranger. If I wanted to insist, do you think that you could stop me? All right. You'll regret this. Of that I promise you. - Who is that girl? - I have no idea. - Come on. Let's take him. - Right. - Yes? - It's Chen Chun. Come in. Have you still got a headache? I must've drunk too much. You're a true gentlemen. I wouldn't want to do anything that I'd regret. Besides, Sau Lai is my friend. Don't mention Sau Lai! I want to forget him! Well, I'm afraid that I have some bad news for you. The Lai palace is completely destroyed and Sau Lai's surely dead. I've an important appointment I must keep now. But still, I don't know what arrangements I should make for you. How can you leave me all by myself? If I take you, I'm afraid you'll regret it. No, I won't. Right. Come with me. When I see him lying there... dying on account of me, I can't stand it. Brother, now come on. He's not dead yet. We've had the best doctors in the region to see him. They can do nothing. - I know who can cure him. - Who? Chin-Chin. He keeps saying her name. We just have to find her, then he'll be saved. But who is she, and where? - I don't know. - We're no further then. Just forget Chin-Chin. Why don't you ask me to help him? Please, miss, just who are you? I'm the only one who can save him. Come on down. Come in. Listen, if you can save this boy's life, I'll give you anything that you want. And if you want my head as your price, I'll give it, and gladly too. Your head means nothing to me. Besides, it isn't yours to give. - What do you mean? - You forget. You haven't found Chin-Chin yet. And soon, then the Governor will kill you. How do you know about that? There is nothing that I don't know or won't do. That's why I could save his life. But on what condition? That he goes with me to my place. - After that? - It's my business and not yours. - No way. - You won't? Well, then you'd better get ready to bury him. - Why, you... - Now, wait. Now, miss, would you be willing to tell us just who you are? It's difficult for us just to hand him over to a complete stranger. Stranger? You don't know just what a stranger I am. Well, all right. Will you let me take him then? - I won't. - You won't? What, going? - No reason for me to stay. - Now, wait! You're staying here to heal him. Do you think that you can make me? Stop it! Please! You have no sense of what's right. He is the sickest of men, but you'd rather he died than I should take him. Why should I harm him? We know what's right or wrong, but we're just worried for him. But I do accept your argument, so I shall let you take him. Put him in. Gently. Listen, he's in your hands. I beg you, take good care of him. You are a good man, and you deserve to live. I just hope that you make it. Brother, what did she mean by that? Did you understand? No matter. It's all fated. But we have clean consciences, don't we? Mistress, can you save him? I don't know. I'm not sure. Then why did you take him away? If he dies, I want to be there. I want to be by his side. - Let's go. - Sure. Right. Go on. All right, come in. - Your Lordship, they're here. - Bring them in. Sir. Your Excellency, I pay my respects. Your humble servant, Lu Yang Chi. Good. I must say, you're very punctual. Have you been successful in getting back all my valuables? I have failed. You may take my life. So you think that life of yours is worth all that much? Two lives then! Although your lives are useless to me, I'll take them. - After all, we are friends. - We're friends? I've never seen you before, so how can we be friends? It's you. So you are the Governor? That's right. Guess you're surprised. You never suspected it. You used the Governor's name to hire us... then used Chen's name to rob us, but why? I am both persons. I'm the commoner Chen Chun, and I'm also Governor as well. But I'm someone else. A third person. Who do you think? - Who? - Who are you? You're the secret leader of the Bloody Rain Clan. - What? - Right. I want the Clan to rule this place. That's why I had to get rid of the Lais and your Dragon escorts. Now you know why you must die. Brother! I'm gonna catch you! I can hear you! Say, I caught you. - Your Lordship. - Your Lordship. - Get Chin-Chin. - Oh, sure. Oh, Miss Chin-Chin, His Lordship's here. Your Lordship. I'm sorry, but I have bad news. Sau Lai is definitely dead. I am very sorry. But still, these things do happen. So you must think very carefully about the future. You must know how I feel about you, don't you? I think that we should get married. I don't see any real harm in the idea now that Sau Lai is dead. You agree? Really? Chin-Chin, don't worry. I'll be good to you. Please announce that the Governor is to marry Miss Chin-Chin. Congratulations, sir. Sau Lai, forgive me. It's for the sake of our child I have no choice. - Tinna. - Oh, miss, you're back. It took me two whole days to find these herbs. So you haven't slept for two days? Sau Lai, how is he? Just look. You see? He doesn't talk and won't eat and just sits there. You know, even if you got the best herbs in the world, they wouldn't help him. - Why not? - Because he's lost the will to live. How do you know? He only thinks of his Chin-Chin. Nothing else exists. Tell me, who is Chin-Chin? Did you ever meet her? If you're not dead, then you're able to listen. I've got lots of bad news for you, and I feel you should know it. If you can hear, nod your head. Right. Firstly... First Dragon's dead, killed by the Bloody Rain leader. Chin-Chin's getting married to a high official, the Governor of Hunan. Something else. The Clan leader and the Governor are one and the same. - Who's that? - Your very good friend Chen Chun. With your poor skills, you'll get nowhere. You can't leave till you've beaten me. One day I will. I said that I'd beat you. - What happens if you lose? - Up to you. Right. You'll do what I say? Anything. Swallow this. You have improved, but still not good enough. You underestimate how good I am. This time I'm going to scar you. What do you want now? To try again? Right. For the last time. What happens now? Like before. Up to you. Tinna. The poisoned wine, bring it here. Right. Well, now, you're going to have to stay here forever... unless you now try to drink up that bowl of poisoned wine. What else can I say? Since you're not scared of death, right... I'll help you to get revenge. But you should know, all I've done had a motive. That wasn't poison in that bowl. It was my blood. I have these special skills... and anyone who drinks my blood acquires them. I'll give you a plan, and you just follow it. Mistress, why do you help him? I don't get it. Silly girl, don't you see? I love the man. Right now I can never pay you for all you've done... but I'll never forget you. Hold it. What do you want? Delivering rice. - Back way. Go on. - Right. - You there, who are you? - Delivering rice. What happened to the other feller? He got sick. Fever. In you go. - Hey, does this look all right? - A bit to the left. - Right. Is that better? - Yeah, that's good. That's good. - All ready? - Yes, my Lord, everything's ready now. - And Chin-Chin? - Oh, she's in the pavilion now. Well, tomorrow's the happy occasion. Are you happy as I am then? Oh, my Lord. What are you thinking? Nothing. What's past is much better forgotten. In future, I'll look after you. Don't worry. I'm sure you'll be happy. - What a good man. - Who are you? Where are you from? You've forgotten? We used to be good friends. I asked you to look after her... and explain to her why I had to send her away. I thought you were my friend, but you've betrayed me. Sau Lai, you shouldn't have come. She will be my wife in this house, and you won't leave alive. I knew that when I came here. But there's something I must do that's avenge Fourth Dragon. So that's it His head is his weak point. Take me! I know I can never repay you for all that you've done but I'll never forget you
