- Thank you. How do you do? How do you do? - I never thought that I'd live to see the day that a girl could get Drogo Gaines, with all his millions, to the altar. - My Helen has done it. - I'll believe it when I see it. - My Helen is a very smart girl. - My Agnes was in the running, but what chance did she have, when he never kept her out after 10 o'clock at night. - Well. - Psst. - What's the matter? - Well come and see. Look. - Young man, what is all this nonsense? Goodness, you better get a doctor quick. - Yes, yes, of course. Dr. Johnson, will you come in please? - Yes, certainly, excuse me a minute. - Listen to me, Drogo Gaines, what do you think you're doing? What's the matter with him? - I think he's nuts. - Here he is, Doctor. - My goodness, we'd better put him on the couch. - All right. - Lend me a hand. - Okay, here we go. - There appears to be no fever, and the pulse is normal. It must be a mental collapse. I'll phone for some assistance. - Hey, Drogo, come on, wake up outta this thing. - Well, what now? - Well of all things to happen to me. - Yeah, happen to you. If you had married the dope two weeks ago, we'd have had the 10 million and we wouldn't care whether he did go goofy. - Ma, it's all your fault. If you'd only let me marry Jerry Vassleven. He had plenty of dough, and besides I might have learned to love him. - How did I know? Look at all the money Drogo's got. What are we gonna do? We can't let those people eat all that food and stuff. Who's gonna pay for it? You go out there and tell them it's been postponed. - All right. - Are you all right? - Oh yes, I'm all right. - You mean to say that you heard everything we said? - Yes, but I didn't do this for that reason. I was afraid to go out there. I realized what a momentous step I was taking. But now that I know where your affections really are, it's probably all for the best. - All for the best, your making a monkey outta me, leaving me at the altar? - I'm very sorry. - Wait a minute. Everybody in this house thinks you're crazy. Now listen to me, Drogo Gaines, you're going to marry me or they're going to think you're crazy for the rest of your life. - Oh, I don't understand, Helen, how are you going to influence those people-- - Let me go, let me go, let me go! - Help, help, what are you doing? - Mother, somebody get him, he's crazy! Help, help! Help me, he's gone violent. Help! - What's the matter, dear? - My poor child. - Good morning, Mr. G. - Would you mind telling me where I am? - The Hopedale Club. - Hopedale Club? I can't stay in a place like this. - I'm sorry, Mr. G, I'll have to refer your complaint to Dr. Thorndike. Now eat your breakfast like a good boy. - I don't want any breakfast. - Please, Mr. G, you mustn't. - Dr. Thorndike? - Oh, pardon me, have you the time? - I'm sorry, I haven't a watch. - Here, take mine. - But listen, I-- I wanna see Dr. Thorndike. - Just have a seat. - Okay, you're progressing splendidly. Now drop in and see me anytime you like. We're always glad to have you. - Thank you, Doctor, thank you. - Mr. N, do you mind if I send Mr. G in ahead of you? Not at all. - Well, well, Mr. Gaines, glad you dropped in. We'll call you Mr. G here. Are you feeling better? - No I'm not. I mean, I never felt bad. - Now don't excite yourself. - I'm not exciting myself, I just wanna get out of here. - Of course, they all do at first, but you will soon learn to like us. We like you. - That's just dandy, Doc. And I'm sure that you and I and all the lads would be come great chums, but really, I've got to get back to New York. - What have you there, Mr. G? - Oh that? A man outside fastened a flower that he didn't have with a pin that isn't here. - Would you mind letting me have that again, please? - Well that is, he thought he had a pin that he put in a flower that I haven't got. Now look, I was just-- - I understand perfectly. - Wait a minute. A fellow simply gave me a flower. - And a very pretty flower it is, too. - Oh. Look, Doctor, there's nothing wrong with me. - Of course there's nothing wrong with you, Mr. G. - Now, Doctor. - Ooh. Cute. - Listen, Dr. Thorndike, I've had enough of this foolishness, you've got to let me go. - Mr. Gaines, I hope you'll appreciate my position in this matter. I have no alternative but to keep you here until your conduct improves. - But listen. - Now don't make it hard for yourself. Finish dressing and go out in the sun. We're allowing you the full run of the grounds. - Ah ah, ah ah. - Oh I'm sorry, I didn't know you were fishing. - What did you think I was doing? - Good fishing? - Excellent. - Caught many? - Nope, never catch any. - It's a sort of new idea when it comes to fishing. - Yes, you're brighter than I thought you were, Mr. Gaines. Sit down. - Oh, you know me? - Know all about you. Carroway's my name, Colonel Carleton Carroway. You've heard of Carroway Seeds. Well, I'm the whole corporation. I didn't like the business, so I came here on my own accord. I like it here. - I don't. I'm going to escape. - Oh not you're not. The walls are too high. Why'd you come here if you don't wanna stay? - I didn't come. I pulled a little stunt in self-defense. - Oh yes, that Newton girl. While you were looking at her eyes, she was looking at your checkbook. - Well I didn't know. And Agnes, she kissed you when you bought her a yacht. You'd have done better with a canoe. And that Argentine tomato, what was her name? - Conchita Montezuma. - You bought her bracelets and called her angel. And she said. Sounded sweet, didn't it? Just means sucker. - You certainly know a lot. - Yes, that's why I'm here. - Tell me, Colonel. How does a fellow know when he's found the right girl? - The signs. - Signs? - Yes. - I don't understand. - Now, supposing a girl, uh, crossed her fingers, and you crossed yours, at the same time, that's a sign. Oh, I've got it. - What's the matter? - Oh, I've caught a fish. Well I'll never be able to fish here anymore. Come on, young Drogo. - What are you gonna do now? - Gonna photograph the fish, everybody does that. - Are you leaving, Colonel? - Yes, this place is no good, there's too many fish. - Something I could do for you? - No. - Now this, Mr. G, is a Blooming Daisy. - The what? The Blooming Daisy, probably the finest camera ever invented by the human mind. Now, don't let her frighten you and don't ask how she works or you'll spoil all the fun. Now, take one step forward. Two backward. Just a mite forward. - Now what are you playing? - That's another invention of mine. I never focus the camera. Anyone can focus the camera, I focus you. Now, are you ready? Hold it, there you are. That merely takes the photograph. And now, we develop it. Come in. - Morning, Colonel. - Morning, Harry, meet Mr. G. - How do you do? - How do you do? - And now we shall see what we shall see. We release the gadget here. See what's in this thing. And at last, the photograph, and there you are. - It's blank. - Yes, that's the wonderful thing about the Blooming Daisy. You never can tell what's coming out. Sometimes I get the most amazing pictures, but not very often. - Uncle Carleton, you're gonna stay with me at the country place. Dr. Thorndike and I think you'll be much happier there. - Oh, well, Harry, I like it here. - I know, but you've got to leave here sometime. You've been here long enough. People are starting to ask embarrassing questions. - Aw, Harry. - Not another word, I know what's best for you. You get your things together, and I'll call for you in the morning, understand? - Yes. - Well, goodbye. Goodbye, Mr., uh. - G. - G. - I hope you have fun playing with your fish. - I'm embarrassing him, that crackpot. - He seemed all right to me. - Oh he did, did he? Come here. Look at that. - What's the matter with that? He's a member of the fire department. - That's just it, he isn't. Well, most likely, the whole thing's my fault anyway. When he was a little lad, I bought him a toy fire engine to play with, said he wanted to be a fireman. He never outgrew it. He's been playing fireman ever since. - Oh. - Go to his country place? Why the whole thing's nothing but a big fire department. He'll not get me up there. I'll run away. That's what I'll do, I'll escape. - You said you couldn't escape. - No I didn't, I said you couldn't. Didn't say I couldn't. If I had enough money to finance the Blooming Daisy, I'd escape tonight. - I have $120. - $120, say, say, that's enough to put the Blooming Daisy on a paying basis. - The Blooming Daisy won't even take a picture. - Sh, you know that, and I know that, but the people we photograph wouldn't know it. Now look, you meet me at the woods near the river at nine o'clock tonight. Boy, we'll hit the open road. We'll meet people, real people, not the money-grabbing kind. Don't forget to bring the money. - Yoo hoo. What kept you so long? - The fool guard didn't show up in time. Couldn't escape unless the guard was there, wouldn't be strategic. Here, take that pole and knock those rocks off. The equipment's there. - What for? - The boat of course, we've gotta launch her. I knew this life would be too good to last, so I plotted this escape years ago. - You call this thing a boat? - Stop all that fiddle faddle and get this stuff onboard. There you are. Here. Now, give me a hand. All ashore that's going ashore! - Sh. - Sh. - How far do you expect to get in this thing? - Who wants to get far? We just wanna get. Heave ho, hardy. Low bridge. - Have Mr. Gaines sent to my office right away. - Thank you, Dr. Thorndike. As Mr. Gaines' secretary, I can assure you, there's absolutely nothing wrong with him. - As his fiancee, I can assure you that there is. - This whole thing is preposterous. I demand that he be released at once. - And I demand that he be kept here. - Dr. Thorndike? - Yes. - Mr. Gaines has escaped. - Escaped? - Escaped? - Yes, and so has Colonel Carroway. - This is terrible. - Hello, Miss White? Miss White, notify the police. Mr. Gaines and the Colonel have escaped. - Fine night for sailing, the sea's as smooth as glass. - We're not at sea, we're in the middle of the river. And my feet are getting wet. - Well a little saltwater never hurt anybody. - That's not saltwater. - I never said it was. I made a statement, and I'll stick by it. A little saltwater never hurt anybody. - Oh, you're impossible. And this raft's impossible. It's probably sinking. It'd serve us right if we both drown. I never should have listened to you in the first place. - Oh, playing the coward, eh? Why, this silly river's so shallow you could wade ashore at any time. - It is? I'm going to wade. This must be the wrong river. Silly old river's shallow, huh? Well, you must have hit an air pocket. - What's that? Waterfall. - Waterfall? Give me that thing or we'll go over. - That's a silly statement. People don't go over falls in rafts. They only go over in barrels. - Oh stop that drivel and give me a hand! - Well, that was a snappy halt. - Yeah, I nearly broke my neck. - Well, all's well that ends well. - Say, what's the idea of throwing things and destroying people's property? - I'll have you know, Madame, that I have just perpetrated the most magnificent escape in my long and brilliant record of achievement. - Escape? So that's it, eh? I might have known. - Now that you know, would you mind telling me how to get to a telephone? - Listen, you're not going anywhere till you pay for what you broke. And a case of Kewpie dolls costs nine bucks. - Well, here's $20, keep the change. - I said nine bucks, no more and no less. - That's the smallest I've got. You mean you don't want the extra money? - No, why should I? - Oh what a girl. - Come on, come on, pay up or I'll call the police. I have nothing smaller than a 20. - Say, you're soaking wet. - Sure, I've been wading. - Here you are, my lad. Change into something of mine. I always carry extra equipment. - Aw no, I'm all right. - Now go ahead, we can't carry on with sick troops, you know, you can change behind the car. - Make it snappy. Say, uh, what's he done? - It isn't what he's done, gal, it's what he might do. His instincts, you know, are all bad. He's been a terrible trial to me, and I've done the best that I could. If he but had the love of a good woman, someone to bring out the finer things in him, to restore his self-respect, then again he could become a man among men. - Oh, ho! Moore's Carnival. - Yeah, Penguin Moore, that's me. - You own this? - Yeah, the whole works. - Bright lights, music, the gay, pleasure-mad throngs. - What throngs? - Merely a figure of speech, my girl, merely a figure of speech. - Ladies and gentlemen, right over this way. - Come on, fellas. Why hello, Penguin, glad to see you're back. - Hi, Alice. You got change for a 20? - Are they still making those things?

Right down that way, lady, to your left. As soon as we get change for the $20, we're on our way. - Now listen, young lady, I been waiting long enough. Either you give me $120 or this show is attached. - Now patience, Sheriff, patience. I do not like to be rushed while I am bathing. In fact, I like to soak. - After 47 minutes, you oughta be waterlogged. Oh, you come right out of there, young lady, or I'm going to come over there and pull you out. - Why, Sheriff, please, after a-- What's going on here? - I was waiting for the head of this here show to get out of the shower. - Well I'm the head of the show. - Oh, you are? You blew Brownsville last night owing money to several citizens of our community for use of the lot, gas, electricity, water. Matter of fact, you didn't pay for nothing. - Just a minute, Sheriff. What is the attachment on this show? - $120. - $120. Well there's your hundred, and here's your 20, now thank you very much, Sheriff. That fixes up everything. - Wait a minute, Mister. I never ask anyone to pay off anything on my show. - Who said I was paying off anything on the show? I merely wanna buy the photographic concession for the Colonel. - You mean you wanna pay 120 bucks so the Colonel can use that Blooming Daisy around here? - That's right. - Well let me tell you, Mister, it ain't worth it. - It's worth a lot more than that to me. Now goodbye, Miss Moore, and thank you very much. - Say, not a bad guy. And cute too. - Well, goodbye, Colonel. And lots of luck with the Blooming Daisy. - Where you going? - Back to New York, of course. - That's my suit you've got on. - Oh, it is, well I'll send it back to you. - Which one of you is Penguin Moore? - I am, why? - Well, I'm Clem Prouty, owner of this lot, and I want that 20 bucks rent money in advance that you promised me. - Well, say, can't you give us a little while? - Nothing doing, I'll give you just 10 minutes to get the money, and either you put up or pack up. And I'll be waiting right here. - Wait a minute. I'll get 20 bucks from these yokels for my Indian remedy if it's the last act of my life. - Now where do you think you're going? - Well with you, of course. Nowhere else to go now that my source of livelihood's been cut off. What a pity. And for the lack of only $20. - I never saw such a mess. There must be some way to make $20. - Say, I've got another attachment on the Blooming Daisy that I saved for just such an emergency. Now you put one here, one here and one here. - Well I'll try anything once. - Here you are, young lady, take care of my bag for me. - Sure, Bud. - Beg your pardon, Stranger. You look like an intelligent person, one who'd be interested in making a little easy money. - Sure, who's gonna learn me? - I am, but in order to accomplish this feet, I shall have to secure a portion of your chewing gum. - What good's gum gonna do you? - That's the secret, I've made hundreds of dollars that way. Now, we attach the little pea to the chewing gum, we attach both to the interior this shell, like so. Follow me, Stranger, I'll show you how it works. Well, well, well, the shell game, eh? The object of this game is to find out which shell the little pea is under. I've had a lot of experience along that line. Say, your shoelace is untied, young fella. Tell you what I'll do, young man. I'll bet you $20 that I can tell you where the little pea is. - I'll be you 20 too. - 20's all I want, 20's the limit. - Wait a minute, take your money back, it was my idea. - Oh no you don't, I had my money up first. - You are unfair, sir, no good in fact. - Just a minute, just a minute. Say, young fella, didn't I have my money down first? - Yes, I guess you did. That gives you the first chance to play, sorry, Mister. - Why it's an outrage! Money won that way'll do you no good. - Now, gentlemen, which shell hides the little pea? - That one. - That one. - It ain't there. - No. - Too bad, gentlemen, too bad. Better luck next time. - It's amazing, the man must be a wizard. I'm glad I didn't bet any of my own money. - And there you are, ladies and gentlemen, the great Indian Princess Yo-Yo in the flesh. She speaks not a word of anything but her native tongue. Now she brings this tonic to you from the sands of the desert, the rocks of the mountains, the land of the mighty red man. Now you've never seen a sick Indian. They're all big, strong, mighty men of nature, and why are they all big, strong, mighty men? Because they use Princess Yo-Yo's Indian tonic exclusively. And now, my good people, this wonderful remedy is worth $5 a bottle, but we're not going to charge you $5, oh no. Nor $2, nor $1, no sir. You're going to buy this wonderful tonic for just 25 cents. And because of the great affection the princess has for the people of this community, with every two-bit purchase, we're going to give you a bow, made by the princess' own brother, Eagle Beak. Now you say to yourself, what will I do with just a bow? Well, we'll tell you. With every 25-cent purchase of the Princess Yo-Yo's tonic, we're going to throw in an arrow, so that you have the tonic, and the bow and arrow, all for the trifling sum of 25 cents. Come on now, folks, step up and get that first bottle. Don't miss this amazing opportunity to buy this great tonic for 25 cents a bottle, or five bottles for $1. Let me just take one bottle and pass it down among you. Just pull the cork out of that, my friend, and take a smell. And don't forget, ladies and gentlemen, that you get a bow and an arrow free with this purchase. - Miss Jinx, here's the $20 you need. Would you mind keeping an eye on the Colonel's camera for me? - Why sure. - Thank you. - Okay. And now, folks, step right up and get your bottle. - Oh, Colonel, where's he going? - He thinks he's going to New York. - Here's the constable now. - I'm constable. - Constable, there's your man right there, and I'm as guilty as he is. - You come along with me too then. - You can't filch me outta money, you city slickers. - First, you make me look ridiculous with that fish. Then, you almost drown me on that silly raft of yours. Next, we become entangled with a broken-down carnival. And you get a bright idea on how to acquire $20 and we land in jail. If you'd kept your mouth shut, I woulda been on my way to New York right now. Are you sure you told that girl to take good care of the Blooming Daisy? - A couple of tough fellas, they put up a great struggle, but I took them, single-handed. Nobody ever gets away from me. Gee Hossafatts. I told you they was desperate. They musta dynamited. - This looks like an outside job. - Do you realize we've broken the law in leaving the jail in that manner? - Well, let's go back, maybe you can think of a better way. - Miss Moore's liable to get herself in serious trouble. If we're caught, she'll be as guilty as we are. - Don't think she doesn't know it. She's one of those regular people I've been telling you about. Let it go. - Ah, howdy, Colonel. Well hello, girls, how are you? - Jinx? - Yeah. - Take him in with you. The cops might be here any minute. You know what to do. - Right. - You come with me. - Miss Moore, don't you think-- - Don't argue, come on. - Miss Moore. If you get a chance to talk with him, keep your fingers crossed for me, will you? - Okay, Colonel. - She sure isn't giving herself the worst of the deal, is she? - Come on, Snapshot Willie, give me a hand. Welcome home. - Now, make yourself at home. - Oh, thanks. Miss Moore, I want you to know that I appreciate what you've done for us. - Oh, skip it. You got my show out of a jam, and I got you out of one. Have a piece of pie. - Thank you. Do you always put salt on your apple pie? - Sure, why? - I put salt on mine too. - So what? - Miss Moore, don't you think that could be sort of a sign? - Sure it is. It's a sign we both like salt on our apple pie. You know, you're not a bad-looking guy. You talk like you been to school and you're the kind of a fella that any girl might fall for. The only thing wrong, though, is your instincts are all bad. - My instincts? - Yeah, they're kinda crooked if you ask me. - Why, Miss Moore, I want you to know that my business integrity has never been questioned. - Aw, stop talking like a gentleman of circumstance. - You mean you don't like gentlemen of circumstance? - I should say not. Gentleman is just a polite word for loafer, if you ask me. Aw, why don't you get an honest job and go to work? You might make something outta yourself. I'll keep my fingers crossed for you. - You did it! - Did what? - You crossed your fingers. - So what? - Miss Moore, that is a sign. - Wait a minute, what is this sign language? - Well, when a boy and a girl both cr-- What's that? - It ain't the curfew. This is it, Moore's Carnival. - All right, Sheriff, you go that way, I'll go this way. We'll search every truck. - Right. - Get down. - What? - Get down. - Come in. What do you mean by breaking in on a lady's privacy? - I'm looking for a couple of jail breakers. There ain't no privacy when desperate criminals is at large. I have every reason to believe they're right with this carnival. - Well you don't think I'd have them in here, do you? - You never can tell. Pardon, ladies, but I'm looking for a couple of fugitives. - Fugitives? - Mm, only if you find anybody, save the prettiest one for me, will you? - Very funny. - Well, any success? - No, not a trace of them. - What do we do now? - I think we'd better get to a telephone and notify every sheriff in the state. - Good idea. - Excuse me, Sheriff, I'd like to suggest my remaining here and keeping an eye open, just in case. - That'd be all right with me. - Thank you, sir. - Boy, that was close. Okay, Colonel, how you feel? - Goodnight, he's stuck. - Oh don't worry, we can always use him for a camshaft. - Get me out of this. - Oh, don't let it get you down, Colonel. I had an uncle who was that way for years. He got it from looking through keyholes. Now relax! That's it, here, here, hold him. Relax, you're too tense, come on. That's it, there you are. Here, that's it, straighten up. Now, how you feel? - Oh, fine. - You sure? - Ooh, fine. - I have to get a phone right there. - Miss Moore, I've caused you a lot of trouble, and I'd like to be of some help. If there's anything I can do. - Sure you can be a help. As a roustabout for this show, you probably won't be worth your salt, but at least it's an honest job. Go back and tell the girls to come up here and you bunk with the Colonel. - A roustabout? - Yeah, a roustabout. - Thank you. - Hold it, tie it, swing it, hit it. Hold it, tie it, swing it, hit it.

The pay's been a little slow, but well, we'll get along all right. I'll send you back pay as soon as we have a few good days. - Oh, forget it, anytime. - Oh, troopers nothing, if I could ever get paid I'd quit this dump in a minute. - What are you crabbing about? - Crabbing? She hasn't paid me a dime in months. - Don't you ever think of anything else besides money? Why don't you try smiling once in a while? You know, ha ha ha, laugh and the world laughs with you. - Oh, baloney. - Oh, why don't you try being like me? - That's too much. - Very funny. But at least I like everybody and I'm a little happy.

You see, I'm really not an Indian. Only kidding with that Yo-Yo stuff, you know, just kidding. In fact, I was born in Brooklyn. You know Brooklyn? - Mr. Gaines? - Oh good morning, Stanhope. - Good morning to you, sir. I've been dreadfully worried about you. A man of your position in an environment of this kind. - Don't worry about me, I'm all right. - Well I'm glad to hear that. Is there something I can do for you, sir? - No, nothing at all. - Well if you're not too busy, you can try pounding some stakes for me. - No, Colonel, that would never do. Just stay around in the background, I'll see you later. - Yes, sir. - Come on, Colonel. - Oh ho, what an invigorating morning. I'm ready for an order of scrambled eggs, a ration of bacon and a huge pot of coffee. - All right, you guys, start pounding this row of stakes and that row of stakes over there, then you can eat. - I protest, I'm a concessionaire. - So am I a concessionaire, but we pound stakes around here before we eat. - I said that I would-- - I said pound that stake. - Yes, sir. - Say, just a minute. - What's on your mind? - How would you like to be the head man in the best carnival in the world? - Who wouldn't? - How much would it cost? - About 200 grand. - I'd like to have you pick one up for me. - Wouldn't you like a nice, new electric train set too? - No, wait a minute, you don't understand. Stanhope. - Where would a punk like you get 200 grand? - Yes, sir. - A blank check, please. - Yes, sir. - I want you to accompany this gentleman. You're going to buy a carnival. - A carnival, sir? - Yes, just fill this check in for any amount necessary. I want the very best, do you understand? Yes, Mr. Gaines. - Say, listen, if this check bounces back on me, I'm gonna bounce right back on you. - I beg your pardon, you're speaking about Mr. Gaines. We never have check trouble. Now if you'll just come with me, we'll attend to everything. - Hey, this is all over my head, I don't understand this. - Let me know when it's ready. Yes, sir. - Take care of your own stake. I'm having trouble enough with this one. You pound this row, I'll pound the other one. - Okay. That's good. Okay. Okay, boys. - Hey, Colonel, come on over and help with these. - You'll do no such thing. You're doing a fine job, Colonel, your stakes are all done. You go ahead and have breakfast. - Thank you, Miss Moore, thank you. - Good morning, Miss Moore. - You can't even pound a few stakes without hollering for help, huh? - I didn't mean-- - You notice the Colonel finished all of his, don't you? - Well, yes, but he-- - Don't interrupt. Look, you pound these stakes before breakfast, and if you can't do that, well, you just be right on your way. Hi, Officer, hope you like our show this year. - All right, can that. As sheriff of this town, I order you to pack up your troupe and get moving. And the sooner the better. - But why? - Well I got word from the last town that you hit that you're carrying a couple of crooks with you, so come on, get going. - On now look, Sheriff, there's-- - I said get going. - Okay. All right, boys, pack it up. - I beg your pardon, Sheriff, but I believe if you'll give me a moment I can straighten out this little misunderstanding. - Can that stuff. - Oh no no, I wanna present you with a portrait to take home to your wife. - Oh, well, that sounds all right. - There you are, just stand right there, not too far away here, while I extend the lens. Turn the little wheel and pull the bulb, are you ready? Hold it, that's it. I've had great success with these family portraits. If you'll bear with me just a moment as we go through the developing process here. And pull the little string here. I believe I'll show you something that your wife's going to be very happy about. - So you're a fresh guy, huh? Now you grab that thing and get outta town before I run you in. ♪ Swing it, hit it, pull it, tie it ♪ ♪ Swing it, hit it, pull it, tie it ♪ ♪ Swing it, hit it, pull it, tie it ♪ ♪ Bop bobba doop dop ♪ ♪ Calliope Jane put on your bonnet and bloop again ♪ - I hope the new carnival will be the finest thing on wheels.

Why, you're just a checkbook lover. Don't you know by this time that this girl is different? - All together now, push, that's it! That's gonna do you no good in the mud. Get up outta the mud there, young Drogo. We can't have this kind of thing. - Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. Ah. - Hey, you're getting to be an expert at this. - Oh, thanks. - Matter of fact, you've been doing so well lately that I've decided to promote you to a better job. - That's great. What's it going to be? - Here's your new outfit, put it on tonight and you'll understand. - Oh, no, you again. - How. - Listen, for the last time, I am not an Indian. Hey, what is this? Oh no, look, no comic valentines, now go away, I'm busy. - Colonel, I can't go out there like this. - Why not? You look beautiful. - That's just the trouble. - Now, ladies and gentlemen, the featured free attraction of the show. The world's greatest aerial artiste. The one and only Miss Penguin Moore, assisted by Gavin Cavalerro. - No, I, I can't. - Take off your robe. - Ladies and gentlemen, I-- Oh, okay, Officer, we'll be on our way. - But listen, girl, can't you see your way to give him another chance? - You saw what happened tonight, Colonel. I gave him a chance, and he just doesn't belong in show business. - Oh ho, that's funny. - What's funny about that? - Doesn't belong in show business. Well, I don't suppose you ever heard of the Great Drogo. - The Great Drogo? - The feature act of every show he ever played in. - Drogo? Drogo? Aerialist? - Hm-mm. - Drogo? Equestrian? - Hm-mm. - Well, there was a Rogo, Rogo's lion act. Or was it Drogo? Drogo's lions, was that it? - I didn't say it, girl, now remember I didn't tell you. - Why. Drogo's lions, that was the greatest act that ever played under the big top. - Well, I can see it now. London, Paris, Vienna, the applause of thousands. - What made him give it up? - What's that? Oh, there he stood, night after night, with guns in his hands. Then came a time when the animals weren't enough. Oh, forget the past. He'll come back, girl, he'll come back. - I feel like a fool, Colonel. Imagine me making him pound stakes in a silly two-by-four show like this. Making out like I was the big shot. I gotta talk to him, Colonel. - Drogo, come here. - Oh I'm very busy, Miss Moore. - I wanna talk to you. - Miss Moore, I want you to know that I'm sorry about what happened in your act. I'll try to make up for it in any way I can. - Oh forget about it, Drogo, and stop tiring yourself out with the stuff around here. - That's very nice of you, Miss Moore. I didn't ever expect you to speak to me again. - Don't talk like that, Drogo. You make me feel so foolish. To think I've been making you pound stakes and do things around here that any kid could do. - I wanna learn all I can and help. - You're going to. You're gonna go right back to the top where you belong. You won't get in with the wrong people this time, because I'll take the guns out of your hands every night. - Guns? That's certainly nice of you, Miss Moore, but I don't-- - Now you don't have to say anything. I know we're gonna get along swell together from now on. - Colonel, what do you think? - What? - Miss Moore just spoke to me and forgave me for what I did to her act. She was so sweet I can't get over it. She said we'd get along swell together. - Certainly, you'll get along swell together. Why shouldn't two great showmen get along swell together? - What do you mean? I don't know anything about the show business. - I know you don't and you know you don't, but, uh. - But what? - Well, I told her you were a great showman. - Oh, Colonel, why did you tell her a thing like that? - Well you're an imposter, aren't you? Better to be a good imposter than a bad one? - What kind of a showman did you tell her I was? - Well I told her you were a lion tamer. - A li--, a li-- Colonel, come back here. Why did you tell her that? - Well there are no lions with this show. - No. - Well what have you got to worry about? ♪ You bloop all my cares away. ♪ - Oh, boys, put this stuff in the truck over there. Willie, you come with me. - Yes, ma'am. ♪ Said he could tame a cat ♪ ♪ Just then along came a tiger ♪ ♪ The tiger now holds the guy's hat ♪ ♪ Calliope Jane ♪ - Now take that. Here, come here.

Still got them, haven't you? - Sure, there they are, come on. - I got the best lion trainer in the business. How about letting me take them and at the end of the season we'll split? - Well it's okay with me if it's okay with Moe. - It's okay with me, Joe. Matter of fact, I'm glad you came. We were just talking about turning them over to the zoo. Business has been so bad we can't even feed them. Take a peek. - They don't look underfed to me. - Me either. In fact, they look powerful healthy. - There's nothing to worry about. All you gotta do is follow the instructions in this book. Gives you their names, the tricks they do and everything. - That's swell. There you are, Willie, read it over carefully. From now on, you're taking care of them. Come on, let's go. - Okay, we'll give you a hand. - You mean? I guess she do. Nealo, Rollo. Nealo? Nealo? Nealo, Rollo. That did it. - Good morning, Miss Moore. - Good morning, Drogo. - I think you ought to know that what the Colonel said was-- - Aw, don't blame him. I'm happy to know that you're one of us. - Well I certainly do wanna be one of us. - There's something I want you to have. Belonged to my dad. He was a lion trainer, too. - Oh, thanks. - Drogo? I want you to know how I feel about you seeing as we're both showmen. I liked you from the start, but that was as far as it could ever go because, well, I had no idea you were my kind. - Miss Moore, I think you ought to know the truth. - Nevermind, it's what's going to happen that counts. - I'll certainly do my best. - You haven't any scratches on you. Didn't the lions ever claw you or jump you? - To tell the truth, they never did. - Gosh, you must have been great. Wouldn't you like to take up where you left off, cracking the whip and hearing the applause? Wouldn't you do it for me? - I guess I'd do just about anything for you. - Well, here they are. Not much after what you've had, but it's a beginning. - They're lions. - Don't expect too much of them, because they haven't been worked in quite a while. - Is you gonna train them lions? - Uh-uh. - Aw, it's no use, Colonel, I can't go through with it. - Now don't be silly. Now look, you're a millionaire, aren't you? - What's that got to do with it? - Everything, why you'd be the first millionaire lion tamer in the world. Think of the honor. Besides, I'm sure that nothing will happen to you. Those lions are easy to work with, aren't they, Willie? - That's what it says here. - There, you see? Now look, I'm going to show you once more. You need have no fear. Why, no lion has ever been known to pass a chair. Now, you advance boldly. Chair in one hand, and whip in the other. - Uh-oh. - All right, ladies and gentlemen, step up and buy yourself a ticket to the greatest thrill of your life. Thank you. Fearless Drogo, the one and only, the world's greatest lion tamer, is going to face one of the most ferocious-- - Jinx, how's it going? - Oh couldn't be better. Step right up, ladies and gentlemen, here you are. - Did you get the smelling salts? - Yes. - The bandages? - Yes. - The iodine? - Yes. - I forgot something. - What? - I forgot to feed them. - Sh. What's the matter, boy? - Colonel, I can't go through with it. - Well you love her, don't you? All you've got to do is to remember what I told you. When you get in that cage, keep jabbing with that chair and cross with your whip. Listen to them, boy, listen, what a crowd. - Can't hold them much longer, they're waiting for you. - The lions? - No, the people, silly. Gosh, you look wonderful. Now go on out there and knock them cold. Tell me, Colonel, is he thrilled? - Thrilled is not the word for it, girl. He's trembling, with anticipation. - You wanna go in there? - No, no, I've got a better idea. Hey, Hup, Texas, Hero, Cesar. Hup, Cesar. - What's he trying to do, Colonel? He's working the cats from the outside. - Yeah. Well, you wouldn't expect the Great Drogo to do the usual thing. Anybody can work lions from the inside of a cage. What a man, he's working them from the outside. - That may be swell, Colonel, but I don't think these yokels understand that. I'll tell him to do it the easy way. Drogo, I think you better do it the regular way. - I can do it fine from out here. - I know, but these people don't understand. I think you better work on the inside. Okay, folks, everything'll be fine in just a minute. Oh, this would have to happen to me. - What's going to happen to you? - Can't you see, the rain is gonna ruin the act? We can't put it on. Willie, put them away. - Yes, ma'am. - It's just a little shower, it's gonna be all right. All right, here. - How am I gonna get back to my trailer. - There you are. - That was sweet of you, JoJo. - Aw, don't mention it. Did you do that on purpose? - What do you think? Did you do that? - You figure it out. - Why you, you! - Now wait a minute, if you hadn't let your stupid instincts get the better of you, all this wouldn't have happened. - And after all I've done for you. Why, for two pence, I'd. - Aw, you poor kid, nevermind. Someday you'll have a fine new carnival. - I don't want a new carnival.

Oh yes, sir, Mr. Newton. - Oh, Mr. Whitman. - Yes, Bates, what is it? - Begging your pardon, sir, but I'm afraid we have gypsies on the grounds. - Gypsies? Well, Bates, do something.

Yes, Mr. Colonel. - And the chicken house is over there. - Chicken house? - Uh-huh. - What am I waiting for? - I don't know. - Me either, tally ho. - Say, Joe, what's the idea of pitching here? - Colonel's orders. - Colonel's orders? - Well what are we gonna get for customers here, field mice? - Quiet, quiet, ain't no use of squawking. We all gotta go someday. It's either gonna be you or me, and it ain't gonna be me. - Take your time, take your time, don't rush me. - The man's right. - Thank you. - You welcome, now will you fix the fowls please, first? - Say, Red, where'd you get these? - Well the Colonel told us we could pick anything we wanted to. - Oh he did, eh? Well I'm still giving orders around here, I think. - Okay, boys, you heard the boss, break it up. - Get this stuff outta here. - Yes'm, Miss Moore, but the Colonel said-- - I don't care what the Colonel said. We're not taking anything that doesn't belong to us. Now put it back where you got it. - Yeah, and make it snappy or we'll all be thrown in the clink. - Sound like we're practically in the clink. - All right, fellas, get rid of it quick. - All right, you heard the boss. Get rid of it, come on, put a move on. What's going on around here? That's it, get going, come on, get going. Well, well. - It's a shame to have to put back these tender birds. - Are they very tender? - Mm-hmm. - Hmm. It would be kind of a shame, wouldn't it? In that box, come on. Be careful, but hurry. Come on, get it going. Now sit down, right there, that's it. Now, act nonchalant. - What do you mean trespassing on private property? - Now, don't get excited, Mister, you've got us all wrong. - Oh have I? - Mm-hmm. - Well then, I'm very sorry. - You see, I'm Penguin Moore, and this is my carnival. We got lost last night and wound up here. We didn't know it was your property. But we didn't take anything. - Well if you didn't take anything, I guess there's no harm done. You've got quite a lot here. - Would you like to look around? - Oh, I'd love to, do you mind? - Oh not at all. There's a pin game over there. - I hate pins. - Here's a merry-go-round. - Oh, it makes me dizzy. - We've got a lot of other things here that-- - What's this contraption? - Oh, this is a taffy machine. Would you like to see it work? - Oh may I? - Okay, Bob, I'll take care of it. - Okay, Miss Moore. - Mechanical devices intrigue me. - Here's the switch here, you see, and you pull it down, the machine goes around with the taffy on it. - Uh-oh. - Hmm, what'll they think of next? - The most interesting part's down there where the motor is. - You're right, it's a dandy.

May I? - Why certainly. - An awful predicament. The new carnival's over at Portersville. What am I going to do? - New carnival? - Yes. - Good, good, now you run along with the rest of them and leave everything to me. - Yeah, but I've got-- - Go right ahead now, don't you worry.

Now wait a minute, I want you to wrap up this carnival and put it in that big barn down the road about half a mile. Then I want you to all go over to Portersville. There's a new carnival over there, bigger and better. I want you to help set it up.

You too ride on the chemical wagon. - By the way, Harry, what are you burning tonight? - The same old barn. - Oh, that's terrible. - What's the matter, Uncle Carleton. - How was I to know that you're still burning the same old barn. In order to save the carnival from the hoodlums, I had the boys hide it in the barn. - You mean the carnival's on fire? - I mean exactly that. - My carnival. - Don't you think I oughta be doing the driving? - Don't be silly, I been pushing trucks around all my life. - Tally ho. Certainly is exhilarating. - Where is the fire? - Nevermind the fire, we're not going there. - What do you mean? - Keep going straight ahead, and we'll lead them into Portersville and the new carnival. - What about the fire? - You told me to get rid of her carnival, didn't you? Maybe when she sees the new one she'll forget the old one. - Oh. - Low bridge! - Take it easy. Oh, stop it. Somebody's going to be hurt, and it'll be me. Hey. Move over. Hey! - Get off the road, that's not fair. - Ah! Oh! Hey, let's move it. Please, fellas, please. Oh now, what'll I do? Hey! - Pretty tricky. - Hey, get me outta here! - Do something, get her down. - Oh yes. - Hey! - Well, here we are. Gaze upon it, it's beautiful, wonderful and all for the love of a girl. The World's Fair on Wheels. I couldn't have picked a better one myself. - Aw, it's beautiful, Moore and Gaines. That's you and me. Do you really mean it? - Yes, for keeps. - Boy, a lollapalooza. Well, so long. Hey, maybe you got something there.
