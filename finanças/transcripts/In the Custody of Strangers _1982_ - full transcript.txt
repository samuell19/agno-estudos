NARRATOR: Each year, an estimated 479,000 juveniles are detained in 8,833 adult jails and lockups. The characters you are about to see are fictional. But the events are based on fact. KAREN: I'm going to Indiana. DANNY: No. They're going to Indiana. The only reason you're going is because they said so. That's dumb. Danny, they're my parents. Well, so what? We're 16, Karen. Heck, my mom married my dad when she was 17. But that was then. If you love me, you won't leave. [SNAPPING FINGERS] Danny, please don't do that. I can't think. Well, what's to think about, honey? Danny, please stop. Please. Well, stay. How? I mean, there's got to be a way. We got friends. We know people. We'll find a place. Where? We could rent a place. It doesn't have to be big, just a couple of rooms. Rent a place? Where are we gonna get the money, Danny? I'll get a job. There are no jobs. The mill closed up and there are no jobs. That's why my folks are moving. Danny! Danny! Sixteen stinking years and they close this place. Danny, you're gonna be the death of me. I know. I stayed over at Pick's last night. We left for school real early. If I tell your father... And you're late for picking up David. You know Mrs. Cooper's gonna have a fit. No, don't tell Dad. That'll be a quarter. You shouldn't smoke. Hey. Did Dad call? Hey, don't tell me. He got the job, right? He'll tell you himself when he gets home. Will you move? Darling, defrost some hamburger for me, will you? And peel some potatoes. Oh, and don't let David... David watch TV, right. Now, look, I want you guys to help me with dinner when we get inside, and no watching TV, okay, David? Hey, boys!Hey, lookit. Dad's home. Dad!Dad! Ho! And Ohio State intercepts on the 40 yard line. It's the 45, the 50, the 45 all the way down to the Michigan 40 yard line. Danny, you just getting home? Yeah. Now you're supposed to have the boys here at 3:00. You know the rules. Go and get my bag, will you? Here you go, Rusty. Come on, tiger, here we go. Daddy's home. Who's got the key to the house? So. How did the trip go? What? The trip. How'd it go? Not bad. Not bad at all. Well, uh, was it worth the drive? If you mean did I get the job? I ain't saying anything yet. Well, do you think you got a good shot at it? I ain't saying anything to anyone until they call me tonight. Oh, Rusty. Go grab the towel.How many times have I told you? You want something at the table, you're supposed to ask for it! It's just an accident.It's not an accident. Oh, for crying out loud! What is wrong with you people? [PHONE RINGING] Can't a man eat his supper in peace around here? Danny, get back, get that...Danny. Rusty, get back to the supper table! Danny! Hello! Oh, hi, Ted. No, no, it's just the kids. [CHUCKLING] You know. Sorry. Say what? Oh, yeah, I understand. No, no, that's all right. Hey, well, listen, Ted, I really do appreciate your trying to help me out on this. Okie-dokie, I'll talk to you later. All right, bye-bye. [HANGS UP RECEIVER] They ain't hiring over at the lumber yard. Frank, the mortgage payment is due. Don't talk to me about the mortgage payment! [DOOR SLAMS] Danny. What're you doing here? Why aren't you in school? Dad, I told you 100 times. School lets out at noon now. Why is that? They're having to let teachers go 'cause they're low on funds. You never listen to me. Wait a minute.What? You come inside with me. I don't want you hanging out on the streets. Come on. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Well, it's a shame about the Yorktown job, but it is a long drive, Mr. Caldwell. There may be some cannery work around. I know that doesn't interest you... But your extended benefits period only has one week to go. What's that mean? Twenty-six weeks maximum benefits, thirteen weeks extended benefits. Taking into consideration the odd work days you've got, last week was the 39th week. One more check. Well, what happens then? Well, you should start your welfare application right away. It's taking longer to go through now. I guess they're, uh, swamped. Now, about the cannery job. Welfare. [SIGHS] Seventeen years at the plant. Four years as foreman. Now, I got to think about welfare. Well, look. Maybe I can go along with you tomorrow. For the ride. Why? Well, if you want some company. What do you think? Yeah, that'll be fine. Come on, let's get out of here. DANNY: You're not going to be in Indiana long.Yeah, I got it. I tell you, you probably won't even like it there. KAREN: Danny, I'm gonna miss you so much. MAN: Watch it, a little to the left. Don't you worry, honey. I mean, uh... I'm gonna find us a place to live, okay? I'm not gonna give up on that. Mom said it's only a day's drive. I could take the bus. We could do it next week. Okay? I'll find me a ride up there and, uh, find a place to stay. KAREN'S MOM: Karen. Honey, we've got to get moving now. Will you please come and help? Promise you'll write me? I'll see you. Bye-bye. Lookie there, Son. Prettiest sight in the world, huh? What's that? People working. [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Alan, how are you doing? What are you doing here?I need a job. [ALL CHATTERING] You remember my boy, Danny, don't you? Yeah, I do. How's the family?Fine. FOREMAN: Welles, Theil, Smith. Ottoman. You, you. You, you! Ralph, Jackson. [ALL CLAMORING] You, you, Moreno... That's all folks. [ALL EXCLAIM] Wait just a second here, pal. What's going on? FRANK: Hey, Danny, come out of there. No, Dad. He's hiring the guys he knows, and that ain't fair at all. MEN: That's right. That's right. Hey, mister. Take that kid home and buy him a candy bar. [MEN LAUGH] Hey, that's my son... [ALL CLAMORING] If he ain't out of here in 15 seconds, I'm calling the police. Nah, he's just a kid. No hard feelings. I'm very sorry about that. He's my son. Sorry. Well, it's the truth!FRANK: Shut up. What's the matter with you? Trying to get us killed? You don't pick a fight with the man that's doing the hiring. He wouldn't have hired us if we stood there all day. How do you expect to hold a job if you can't even hold your temper? Don't you get it? All the fellows he hired are probably friends of his. They all live around here. They get drunk together. They go to church together. That's how it is, Son. Then why'd we bother to drive 60 miles, huh? You got a better idea? I wouldn't stand around here waiting for some idiot to hire me. [ALL CHATTERING] FRANK: I started in here as an apprentice right after I got out of the army. Me and Clyde Ware started together. You remember Clyde Ware, don't you? DANNY: Yeah. We started together in the foundry right over there. Seventeen years ago. Look, Dad, uh... Boy, this place was really jumping during the Vietnam War. Just hiring guys right off the street then. It seemed like everyone I knew worked here then. They was good people, Son, all of them, good people. Of course, even when things slacked off some, they still moved me up to foreman. You remember the first time I brought you here? The day I made foreman? Yeah, sure do. It was quite a day, wasn't it? Yeah. I don't understand what's happening to this country. Look, I got to go. Where're you going? I got some stuff to do. You're going downtown to hang out with them punk friends of yours, aren't you? You be home for supper! Hey, what do you think you're doing, buddy? Huh? [LAUGHS] Hey. [LAUGHING] This town's a pit. You can't blame the town, man. It's the mill's closing down. Things will get better when the mills open up... Yeah, right....again. Come on, come on. I got an idea. [TIRES SQUEALING] [CAR HORN HONKING] Hey! Hey! Man. [LAUGHING] [HONKING] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] Hope you enjoy that. Can I help you guys? Yeah. I need some, uh, record cleaner.Record cleaner. Cleaner?Yeah. Got it right here. STORE CLERK: There you go. PICK: I don't think this is right. You have the other one? STORE CLERK: Yeah, why?ROACH: For stereo records, right? Yeah. STORE CLERK: Yeah, here it is. 1.39. ROACH: Is the stuff good? Yeah. Sorry. I think I'll take this. This stuff is good. Hey!Real good. Hey, come back here! [ALL CLAMORING] Don't leave your store, man. Thanks, man. [LAUGHS] STORE CLERK: Damn. Whoo! [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] You see his face? Stealing a radio. You're a thief! And you're going to take it back first thing in the morning! And don't say it wasn't you. You were seen! Frank Caldwell's boy seen stealing a radio! You're headed for big trouble, Danny boy, and I'm gonna tell you something! Don't come running to me for help, 'cause you won't find it here. So what else is new? You think you got problems 'cause I had to take your record player back. Let me tell you something, Son. You don't know what problems are! Go on out in the real world and own your own way! 'Cause I've had it with you! All right! I will! I'll get a job! I'm not gonna stand around waiting for some bum to hire me neither! Get back here! I'm going out. You ain't going nowhere! As long as I'm paying the bills around here and feeding your face, you do like I tell you!Yeah, yeah. Don't you "yeah, yeah" me! You go out that door, Son, you ain't never coming back! You hear me? You hear me?I hear you! I don't hear nothing but you! Let me tell you something. Mom's the one that makes the payments around here. And Mom's the one that's feeding my face! Until you get around to doing it, maybe then you can tell me what to do. [DOOR SLAMS] [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] All right! Whoo!Give it here. DANNY: Go! Go! Ziggy-zige, ziggy-zige, ziggy-zige, ziggy-zige, ziggy-zige, ziggy-zige... Ah! [BOTH LAUGHING] Aw, Karen, where are you? Haven't got any more money. A hundred bottles of beer on the wall. Think the liquor store is closed? There is no money at the liquor... [LAUGHING] A hundred bottles of beer on the wall... A hundred bottles of beer...Okay. Take one down and pass it around...Wanna hold up a bank? A hundred bottles of beer on the wall. A hundred bottles of beer on the wall... Grenades. Take one down and pass it around...I always wanted to hold up a bank with some grenades. [LAUGHS] You're sick! You've got a sick mind, man. [BOTH LAUGHING] Whoo! [CONTINUES LAUGHING] Oh, man. [ROCK MUSIC PLAYING] [CONTINUES LAUGHING] [CAR HORN HONKING]DANNY: Whoo! [DANNY CONTINUES LAUGHING] No hands. Whoo! [LAUGHING] What kid on the bike, Officer? Whoa! [CONTINUES LAUGHING] What's... What's the problem? [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Who is this? Yeah, he's my son. Who is this? He was drunk? Is he all right? Where is he?[SIGHS] It's Danny. He got drunk and hit a police car. He's all right, thank God.[GASPS] When is that boy gonna learn? Yes, uh, Sergeant, I'm here. All right, sir. Listen, uh, if my boy breaks the law, he's gonna have to take the punishment. You keep him down there for the night. I'll pick him up in the morning.What? Yes, sir, that's what I said. No, Frank... Uh, maybe a night in jail will help straighten him out some. No, Frank, you... All right, I'll be down tomorrow. Thank you, Sergeant. Good night. Frank, you can't leave him in jail. He's better off there. If I saw him now, I'd kill him! Well, if you're not going to go, I am. No, you ain't. Now, listen to me, darling. He's got to get it through his thick skull. There are rules and he's gonna have to learn to live by them, just like everyone else. A night in jail might do him some good. [EXHALES] I can't believe you're letting this happen. All right, kid. Let's head for the tank. Not me, man. My dad's picking me up. [CHUCKLES] Listen, don't hold your breath. Your dad says that we keep you until he's good and ready to come and get you. Now, let's go. He said that? Come on. Let's go. Got a 16-year-old drunk driver. His father won't come and get him. Keep him separate from the others. Okay? [INMATES CHATTERING] INMATE: Can I make a phone call? Please, sir. [INMATE COUGHING] [CHATTERING CONTINUES] Hey, kid. You have a cigarette? Could sure use a smoke. First time in here? Mine too. Can't sleep. Thinking of what I'm gonna tell my wife tomorrow morning. What are you in here for? Ah, a dumb thing, you know. I stopped at this bar for a couple of drinks, you know, unwind. Got into it with this moron. I should've known better. Hey, uh, how old are you, anyway? Almost 17. Is that right? See, I would've thought you were older. Nineteen, 20. What's the matter? Ah. I don't know. I guess I pulled something. I got in an auto wreck. Hey, come here. Let me take a look. I got a boy that plays football. He's... He's always pulling a muscle or a tendon, or something like that. What does he play? Well, he's a defensive half back. How about yourself? Yeah, I play quarterback. Yeah, right in there, right in there. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I really can't get it proper here. Scoot over a bit here. Yeah, yeah, come on. Let me... Come, come on. Come on, come on, come on, come on. What're you doing? [SCREAMING] [ALL CLAMORING] CARUSO: Dupres, have them take young Caldwell to visiting. Sir, they told me I could take my son home today. The judge will decide when Danny goes home at the detention hearing tomorrow. Detention hearing? If the court feels that he's a menace to the community, or to himself, they'll keep him. If not, they'll send him home. Well, menace? No, no, he ain't that bad. [CHUCKLES] Mr. Caldwell, your son beat up a man so severely he's in county hospital with a suspected skull fracture. You can see him for 10 minutes upstairs. Then, uh, if I were you, I'd go home and get a lawyer. Why, he's just a boy. What's he need with a lawyer? Assault and battery is a serious charge. He'll need a lawyer. Um, sir, I know this sort of thing is routine for you people, but, see, I've never been in this sort of... [PHONE BUZZING]Excuse me a second. Caruso. [SIGHS] Hold on a moment. Mr. Caldwell, if you wouldn't mind stepping outside, Dupres will take you to visiting. No, you got to keep him separated from the adult prisoners. I know, but he'll be in a juvenile facility or home in a couple of days. Wait a minute. Okay. Hello, Son. Hi, Dad. Are you all right? Yeah. Yeah, I'm sorry. [STAMMERING] It was just weird. This guy grabbed me, and... How many times I got to tell you to control your temper? That man's in the hospital now with a busted skull, and you got to go to court tomorrow. You don't understand.I don't wanna. [SIGHS] How are you ever gonna get a decent job with a court record? Court! I've never been in a courtroom in my life. I said I was sorry. I don't know what to do with you, Son. I really don't. What? Can you get me out of here? [CLEARS THROAT] Now, here's the deal. [SIGHING] Tomorrow, uh, I'll bring you some clean clothes, I'll bring your suit for you to wear... [CLEARS THROAT] 'Cause I want you to look neat and clean for the courtroom. And then I will talk to the judge personally and we'll work everything out. Don't worry. Everything will be just fine. But you've got to behave yourself. [SIGHS] Well, I got to go now. See you tomorrow. Tell Mom I'm okay. Say what? Tell Mom that I'm all right. I will. Dad, I don't get it. Thought you said you were bringing him home. I know. But your brother hit a man in jail last night and put him in the hospital. [MIMICS GUN FIRING]Now, he has to go to court tomorrow. How come he was there last night? Will you stop that? What?How come he was there last night? Because, Son, he broke the rules. You gotta abide by the rules in life just like in football. So, when's he coming home?Hold this for me. He'll be home after I talk to the judge tomorrow. Now, wash up them dishes before you drop 'em. But that's Danny's job! Don't sass me. Just wash the dishes. [CHATTERING ON TV] RUSTY: Don't see why we can't get someone to fix that dishwasher. Shut up and wash the dishes. Get over here. Come on. Sit down. All right, get out of there. Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight. One, two, three, four, five, six. Two, three, four, five, six. [SOFTLY] Two, three... [KEYS RATTLING] Hey, Danny. How's it going? Good. Who're you? I'm Joe Corcoran and I'm your probation officer. Well, what do I need a probation officer for? Well, you tell me and I tell them, and we get you out of here. Just like that? As simple as that. You know as well as I do that selling dope is a violation of your probation. If it's up to his father, he'll put him back in the hospital, or leave him out on the streets... Basically, what we have here, are two counts of shoplifting and one of attempted forgery. Chris is upstairs now in detention for assaulting a police officer. Chris? Who're you talking about? Betjeman, right? You're Chris Betjeman's... No, no, sir. We're the Caldwells. Danny's our boy. Oh, right, Caldwell. Danny Caldwell. Okay, well, basically, this is not a trial. Has anybody explained this to you yet? No. Yes, but look, I want to ask you a question. Now, you're Danny's probation officer, aren't you? No, no, I just handle the courtroom stuff. Somebody else is assigned to Danny's case. He should be down here in an hour or so, maybe an hour and a half. Wait here. He'll be down. Excuse me, is Matthew here? Betjeman? Danny! Hi, Mom. Darling, how are you?Okay. You look good.Thanks. Hello, Son.Hi, Dad. How're you doing? Corky says I lucked out. I get, uh, Judge Halloran. Well, who's Corky? That's me, Mr. Caldwell. Joe Corcoran. How are you, sir?I'm Danny's case officer. I'm Frank. This is my wife, Sandy. Mrs. Caldwell.Hello, Mr. Corcoran. What Danny's saying is that Judge Halloran is the one who really tries to look out for the kids. Now, considering Danny has described self-defense, I don't think we've got a problem. Yeah, well, it shouldn't matter what judge he gets. The boy was in the wrong. What do you mean... You don't know what happened. You're not listening. No, you're not listening! Now, you've had your way long enough, Son. It's time you kept your mouth shut and paid some attention. Frank. Frank, please. All we got to remember now is to speak up, tell him what happened. Just tell him the truth. That's right. Yeah, you'll also tell him how sorry you are, and you're gonna stay out of trouble from now on. The man is talking to me. Shut up! This man is talking to you. Frank, Frank! Your Honor, this is the matter of the continued detention or release of one Danny Caldwell, a minor, case 4407B12. Ms. Blake? Your Honor, the charges against Danny Caldwell are driving while intoxicated, driving without a permit and assault and battery. The victim of the assault is still in the hospital. So, I'd like to request that detention be continued until our investigation of the incident is completed. Your Honor, this assault was provoked by homosexual advances. BLAKE: Oh, come on, Corky! They were in separate cells with bars between them. How much of a sexual advance could there have been? Well, how much of an assault could there have been? He put the man in the hospital! A man. This is a boy! That's enough, that's enough. Am I to understand this boy was placed in city lock-up? Your Honor, it was a Saturday night. Mr. Raines, the law specifically states that juveniles must not be incarcerated with adults. [SIGHING] Mr. Caldwell, it says here that you requested that Danny be detained after his initial run-in with the police? Yes, sir, and... [COUGHS] Excuse me. Yes, sir. I did. Uh... Because, you know, he hadn't been behaving himself lately, and I thought, uh... Well, a night in jail might help, uh, straighten him out some. [STUTTERING] But, sir, this, uh, deal here, with the homo... The advances thing is the first we ever heard of it. I tried to tell you, but you never listen to me, do you? Your Honor, drunk driving is an offense, a dangerous offense. Furthermore, whether or not the defendant overreacted in city jail, I'd like to point out that he seems to have very little respect for the law. Even his father agrees with that. Therefore, I'd like to request that his detention be continued. HALLORAN: Mr. Raines. I think the home situation is, uh, difficult. The father? It's not good, Bill. Danny, I have to decide whether to let you go home or keep you in detention until your arraignment, which is when you plead guilty or not guilty to the charge. Understand? Now, you don't seem to be getting along too well with your parents. While I'm not sure you're a menace to the community, I'm not sure you're not either. So I'm going to give you some time to think about that here. Mr. Raines, how's the calendar? Uh, your Honor, we have an opening Friday at 10:00. So be it. Danny, we'll see you on Friday morning, and I want you to give some serious thought to the way you've been behaving. Mr. Caldwell, do you have a lawyer? Um, no, sir. Can you afford one? No problem. The court will appoint an attorney for Danny. See to that, will you, Mike? Right. What's next? Now don't worry, honey. You heard what the judge said. He's gonna learn a lot from this. He's not gonna learn anything good in there, Frank. Let's open up. Open it up. Come on. Come on. Open the door. Come on. Let's go! Let's open the door. Come on! Guard! Well, it's about time. I been yelling to myself for hours. What is this? Solitary confinement? [SIGHS] This is a sight and sound operation, Caldwell. It's for your own protection. The law says the only adults you see in this jail are your parents, your attorney, your probation officer and my staff. That's the way I run it. Ain't nothing to do. My men have got better things to do than entertain you. You can stick your jail. Get a mop and pail. Clean it up! And do it right. Or I'll have you scrubbing this cell for the rest of the year. Now you got something to do. Lock it. DANNY: I just want someone to talk to! Open up! I just want somebody to talk to! Did you hear me? I want somebody to talk to! Caruso! Just someone to talk to! Just for a few minutes! Just let me talk to someone! I can't take it in here anymore! Just someone to talk to! Just for a few minutes! Let me talk to someone. Mr. Caruso! Guard, somebody! [PHONE RINGING] Hello. Yes, Mr. Raines. [POLICE CAR SIREN WAILING ON TV] He's seeing the lawyer today? No, my husband's in Aberdeen on a job interview. Well, yeah, I suppose I could if it's after 3:00. His brother could babysit then. David. Hold on a minute. [LOWERS VOLUME] Yeah, where? I'm sorry, I didn't hear you. [INCREASES VOLUME] David! Excuse me. All right. Yeah. I'll be there. You were certainly drunk, huh? And you don't have a license. And driving into a police car. [LAUGHING] That's funny. I always wanted to do that. Now, the assault... But Corky says I was defending myself on that one. Yeah, that's right and we're gonna use that. Listen, they shouldn't have put you in the tank in the first place. And whether they do that all the time or not doesn't matter because we're gonna make a lot of points on that. Well, I still don't get it. If I wasn't supposed to be there in the first place, and I hit the guy to get him away from me, how come I got to plead guilty? Danny, why don't you just let Mr. Barnes finish? Is it okay if I smoke? Oh, no, please, Mom. Mom, I wanna know why I got to plead guilty, okay? Look, there's no problem. I know it's tough to understand. Look, the prosecutor is in a tough spot. You beat up on a guy when he was in the state's custody. So what do you think I'll get? Well, you're a juvenile. You got no priors. Maybe 30 days detention, maybe less. Thirty days? You want me to plead guilty, you do the time, buddy. You spend the time in there! Danny. Mr. Barnes, we want Danny home. Now, if he, if he pleads not guilty... If he pleads not guilty, they're gonna set a trial date. Now, because he's a juvenile, you have no guarantee of bail. The trial should be in less than 30 days, but in reality... Hey, the courts are backed up this far. It's gonna be a month, or two months, maybe even three. You mean that if he pleads not guilty, he could be in here longer than if he pleads guilty. Exactly.Oh, my! Are you sure you got this right? I'm afraid so. That is just the way it is. Okay? No. Look, I have a custody hearing in 10 minutes. Mrs. Caldwell. Thank you for your help, Mr. Barnes. No problem. You and Danny talk this over, let me know what you decide. Okay? Danny, I'll be seeing you, huh? Mom... I know, darling. Look, your dad will be home tonight. I'll tell him first thing, and he'll decide what's best. I'm sorry. Oh, darling. It's all right. I'm real sorry. I know. I know. [BELL RINGS] Whoa, Alex, I can't believe it! No, don't tell me that! It can't be true! It's too good to be true! Tell me again! [LAUGHS] Yeah, I heard you. I just want to hear it again! Okie-dokie. Good deal. I'll be there. You can count on it. Hey, listen, big brother, thanks a lot. I owe you one. Okie-dokie. I'll see you next week. Bye-bye. Thanks again, brother. Guess what, darling. Alex says their supervisor's retiring at the end of the month. He's talked to Dan Graves in Personnel. They want me for the job. In Akron?Where's Akron? In Akron, Ohio! Ohio! Ohio State, right, Dad? That's right, tiger. Ohio State Buckeyes, the best football team there is! Oh, it's Caldwell on the 20 yard line. It's a fumble, a fumble! Ohio State recovers, first down. Yeah! [LAUGHING] Where is Akron? Go get the almanac. I'll show you. Darling, I can't believe it. I cannot believe it! This is, uh, definite? Well, you know, uh, we got to go through all the motions and all. I got to go over there next week for the appointment and everything, but don't worry about it. Alex says I'm in like Flynn. You remember Dan Graves, don't you? Big, tall, curly-haired fellow? We used to hang around together all the time? He and I were on the same bowling team. You remember him? Oh, yeah.Oh, praise be God. Yeah, bless him Almighty! I can't believe this good fortune. Best news I've had all year! What do you say, Momma? I don't know.Sure you do. I mean it's wonderful. I just... I just keep thinking about what the lawyer said about... Don't worry about what the lawyer said, darling. If he's innocent, that's the way he's gonna plead. Yeah, but the lawyer said that...Not the lawyer, nothing. We're going to the courthouse on Friday morning and Danny's coming back with us home on Friday afternoon. That's all there is to it. Let's see that, darling. Okay, Dad. This is where we are.That's right. Now, when this case is over, and it is definitely mine, you owe me lunch. Uh, well, actually I mean, if you think about it, you owe me. How come there's nobody else in the court? I don't think they allow them, honey. It's juvenile court. Oh. Your mom picked me up at the bus. Are you surprised?You bet. I don't want him seeing those boys when he's off here. We're gonna party, my house. We missed you, Danny. Yeah, I missed you guys. It's gonna be great to get out of here. We're gonna start all over with this boy. We're gonna do it right this time. None of that trashy company. Whatever happened to that Anderson kid? Oh, Bennett sent him to State. The kid's an incurable runaway. I said you'd be a runaway, too, if somebody beat you like that. Hey... All rise. Please be seated. Mr. Raines. Yes, your Honor, this is the matter of the arraignment of Daniel Caldwell, case number 4407B12. Danny, I have your advice and rights acknowledgment here signed by you and your mother. You read and understood it? Please give the court a verbal reply. This is being taped. Uh, yes, I understood it. Have you given any thought as to why you're in here in the past few days? Yes, sir. And I'm sorry about what I did. I'm glad to hear it. Mr. Barnes, how does your client plead? If it pleases the court, my client wishes to plead guilty on all three counts. However, we wish that the extenuating circumstances be considered, because... I don't want to do that. I don't want to plead guilty. Wait a minute, Danny. Look, I said I was drunk and that's it. No, no. We talked about this. No, Mr. Caldwell, I can take care of it. I can take care of it. I changed my mind. Danny, you want to plead not guilty to the assault and battery charge, is that right? Yes, sir. [SIGHS] Ms. Blake, I have witnesses' depositions here, but I can't seem to find the plaintiff's affidavit. Your Honor, uh, Mr. Quinn signed himself out of the hospital yesterday. And so far, we've been unable to locate him. Since I don't anticipate that taking long, I'd like to request that detention be continued. Request denied. No reason why the defendant should sit in jail because the prosecutor's office loses people. Mr. Raines, I want a trial date set within a 30-day period. Uh, your Honor... And, uh, Mr. Corcoran, I'm also missing Danny's evaluation. Oh, we're pretty backed up in probation right now, sir. Danny's been available to you for five days. Now, I want this resolved. Your Honor, November 12th would be good. Very well. Mr. Corcoran, I'm giving you 48 hours for the initial psychological work-up. Uh, Monday's a holiday, sir. The department's closed. And I have to check Dr. Forman's schedule for time. Have Dr. Forman make time. Excuse me, Your Honor, when can Danny come home? Mr. Caldwell, I'm sorry about this, but the court requires an evaluation of Danny and it hasn't been done. Now, he'll have to stay here until this is underway. After his release to you, he must continue to see his probation officer and the doctor. Is that understood? Yes, sir. First, it's one day. Then it's five. Now, it's another week.It's all right. I can't sit in this cell no more.It's all right. I just can't take it.Just take it easy. Everything's gonna be all right. I'm thinking of getting us another lawyer. Someone older, more experienced. Hmm, Mr. Caldwell, you can't do much better than Andy Barnes. Yeah, well, I'm sorry, Mr. Corcoran. I know you people are busy, but this just isn't good enough. First that lady losing her witness and you people not doing what you're supposed to and he's still here! We do the best we can, sir. We're understaffed. And there's always more kids coming. We'll see you later, Son. Danny, bye, darling. I'll see you soon. Bye, babe. FRANK: Can't you get him a radio or someone to talk to or something? It ain't right for a boy all alone in jail like that. Well, I don't know about a radio. But he's gonna be seeing plenty of me in the next few days if we're gonna get him out by next weekend. Well, he's learned his lesson. He ought to be coming home now. Hey, how long was it before you became a trustee anyway? Hey, wait a minute, wait a minute. Hey, pal, wait a minute. You know who plays football today? Huh? You know what day today is? Oh, who cares anyway? I'd like to have some sounds, Corky. Some music, you know? CORKY: Danny you got to get this done, eh? So, uh, Pick and Roach are your best buddies, right? Roach... He, uh, doper, huh? No, he used to eat cockroaches when he was a kid. What's the ping pong table for, huh? Juveniles in detention. But you can't play it unless there's a guard supervising and Caruso's short-staffed now, just the same as everybody else... Oh! Danny... [SIGHING] Okay, so, is that your, uh... Is that your girl in court? She's... Is that your girl in court? Yeah, that's Karen. Karen. Karen. You can handle Caruso. You can get me a radio, can't you? I told you I'd try. All right? This Karen's pretty cute, Danny. You guys have sex? That's none of your business. All right? How about dope? You smoke dope? Take pills? Drink liquor? Drink beer on a regular basis? You get me a radio, I'll tell you anything you want to know, okay, Corky? Listen, kid. I want you out of here as bad as you do. You think I like working 18-hour days? Come on. I got to go pick up my kids! You married? I used to be. Okay? Okay. Now let's get some answers. You got a shrink to see. A shrink, huh? Okay. I'm kind of wired, you know? You want to talk? Yeah. Yeah, I do. [SIGHING] Hello, Danny. How've you been doing? Okay. How about you? Great. Fine. I've never been better. I'm sorry. That was stupid. What I meant to say...Yeah, I know what you meant. You wanna give us five? I'll be outside the door. Danny, none of this is your fault. You'll be going home soon. Yeah. You're seeing some other guy, aren't you? No. What is he, the uh, the school jock? Senior, junior? What? Danny, stop it! Go home, Karen. Go on. Get out of here. I want Danny home. I want him out of that place. And I can't think about going to Ohio or anything else until he's home. Well, I have to think about it. I can't afford to lose this job. You think it feels good me knowing you're supporting us all? How can you leave when he's still in there? I have to, darling. Don't you understand? I don't have any other choice. Neither one of us do. We're gonna have to start all over again. Nothing left for us here. And don't worry. We'll get us another house. You know, maybe we can rent one near the family. It's your family, Frank. I want to stay here. And I want Danny home. You think I don't? DR. FORMAN: Danny Caldwell, juvenile. Eleven days in detention. I saw him yesterday and this morning. Look, Al. This kid's a time bomb sitting up there. He's got to be around some people. Something. Oh, Wendy, he'll be out in two days. No. Three days.Three days. Tomorrow I'm at Mar Vista State. I can't finish the work-up. Do you know what three days is to a child? Look, I know sight and sound separation require isolation. But if we don't find him something to do... I'm gonna have to file a report. How about if I put him in the kitchen with Faye? Would you like that? The kitchen'll be fine. Thanks, Al. You don't have to cook, okay? I'm the best cook in the entire state, so you won't do no cooking. You'll clean up the stove. You clean the counters, the faucet, the pans, the sinks, the utensils, but you don't cook. Got it? CARUSO: The law says I have to keep you separate from the adult inmates. The shrink says I have to give you something to do. And you're not allowed to talk to anybody. Understand? One word from you, and I hear about it from Faye, you're back in your cell. Any questions? None. He's all yours, Faye. [SIGHS] FAYE: You know how to wash dishes? Yeah. Thank God for small mercies. [LAUGHS] Go to it. [CLOCK WINDING] Hey.WOMAN 1: Hey, dishwasher. [ALL CHATTERING EXCITEDLY] [WOMEN WHOOPING] WOMAN 2: Hey, hey, hey, hey! Faye's got herself a new cutie! [ALL LAUGHING] [WHOOPING CONTINUES] Hey, cutie! WOMAN 3: What're you gonna do, Faye, have him for breakfast? He won't even make an appetizer. [CHATTERING CONTINUES] WOMAN 4: Faye, you're gonna have to feed him up a little if you want to, uh... Yeah, give him some of this good food. Hey, yeah! Let's have a front view. Hey, turn around! Whoo! He ain't even supposed to talk to you bums. Caruso's orders. So just lay off him, starting now. [ALL CHATTERING] Come on, give them a nice little look. ALL: [CHANTING] Turn around. Turn around. [PLATES BANGING] [ALL CHEERING] All right. Have your meals and get out. [CHEERING CONTINUES] [GRUNTS] [PANTING] How is she? I guess she's doing okay. She's going out for mat maid when wrestling starts. Oh! Yeah. Boy, being in the kitchen's a lot better than sitting up in that damn cell. Stop cursing, Danny. When did you start to smoke? Big Faye slips me one now and then. She's the cook. [SIGHS] So, Dad's leaving for Ohio tonight, huh? Mmm-hmm. You going with him? No, honey. I'll be right here. I'm not gonna leave. Danny, you know he'd be here if he could. The lumber yard just called this morning and... Days with pay is better than nothing. Two days left. Hey. Hello. I'm not supposed to tell you, but Rusty and David have a surprise party planned for you when you come home. And Davey made you the cutest gift. I don't know what it is. It's a dog or a cat or a hippo or something. He tore up strips of newspaper and he... He made a glue out of flour and water and... You remember how you used to do in kindergarten? What do you call that? Paper mache.That's it. Paper mache. [LAUGHS] The kitchen was such a mess. It looked like something out of those old-time movies. You remember how you used to love to watch those movies on TV? Mom, would you quit talking about me like I'm dead or something? [SIGHING] Danny... Here you go. There's some candy there and some gum. I mean, you got to get me out of here. I'm not just talking here. I'm going crazy. I will, darling. I promise. [DOOR CLOSING] He's so different. I mean, he doesn't even sound like Danny anymore. Yeah, well, maybe he's starting to grow up. Anyway, he'll be back tomorrow and everything'll settle down. Don't worry. All right, I know it's been longer than we thought, but, uh, I don't feel like it's my fault, you know? [LAUGHS] I've been making deals with myself like when I was a kid. You know? If Danny comes home tomorrow, I'll quit smoking and if you get the job in Akron, I'll... You'll what? [SIGHING] I will stop being afraid. Frank, I don't want to leave here. I've lived here my whole life. Hold me tight, please. I am so scared. [SOBS] Come on, honey. Oh, baby. Don't worry. Everything's gonna be all right. Oh, Mrs. Caldwell.SANDY: Oh, hello. We've had a slight change of plans. Judge Halloran's got the flu. We're gonna have to go with Judge Bennett. I just checked. What? Does this mean we have to wait longer? No, no, it's not a problem. Judge Bennett will sign the release papers. Just a formality. Is Mr. Caldwell joining us? Uh, no, sir. He, uh, had to go out of state, uh... For, uh, some business. Uh, he was waiting so long and then, 'cause the dates kept changing, finally he just had to leave. Mrs. Caldwell, I see from the background report that you're employed. Yes, sir, that's right. Well, just until Frank gets... That's my husband, Frank. Just until he gets things straightened out. And Mr. Caldwell is returning, uh... Uh, well, he thought on Thursday, or the weekend at the latest. And who will be supervising Danny and the other children? I will. I mean, uh, well, I'll take off from work. Uh, I mean, I just, I didn't think... You must understand, releasing Danny to your custody entails strict enforcement of the court's order. And judging from this evaluation, he requires both parents, particularly Mr. Caldwell, to supervise him at all times. No, Danny does what I tell him. Well, I'm sorry, Mrs. Caldwell, I... I can't take the responsibility for your son's release, until your husband comes home. Well, uh, you mean you think he's better off in jail? No, this is crazy! This is cruel! It's not my intention to be cruel. We're trying to help your son. And I feel the best thing for him is to be kept here for now. I'm sorry you don't agree. Now, if you'll excuse me, I... I'm due in court. So they figure they'll keep me away from all them bad influences at home, huh? Like Rusty. Or David! So when's Dad coming home? Oh, I'm calling him tonight, honey. I'm telling him to get back here right away. And Corky's gonna try to get in touch with... [SOBBING] With Judge Halloran. Oh, Danny, I'm really sorry, honey. I know I promised. I know you promised, Momma. Don't worry about it. It's only a couple more days. Okay? It's only a couple more days. I can handle it. Well... [CRYING] Come on, don't cry. Come here. Surprise!Surprise! Where's Danny? They wouldn't let him come home, Rusty. Not without your father here. They just wouldn't let him. Is Danny ever coming home? Who cares? DR. FORMAN: Danny. I'm never getting out of here. They're just gonna keep on figuring ways and make me stay. It's unfair. I'm not gonna tell you it isn't. About Karen... She already got herself another guy. She knew I was in here for good. Is that what she told you? What's the difference? Danny, you're not in here for good. It's a lousy, awful thing that's happened to you. But you will go home. You think? I do. No. [DOOR CLOSING] [PEOPLE CHATTERING] Gimme some of them eggs. Hey, watch out what you're doing. I'll take your face apart, punk. [EXCLAIMING] [ALL CLAMORING] [BELL RINGING] [CLAMORING CONTINUES] GUARD: Come on, give us some room. Break it up, there, guys. Come on! Let me get through! Break it up. Break it up, I said! Listen, kid. This has got nothing to do with me, you know. A man gives an order. I do what I'm told. I can handle it. [GAGGING] Come on, man. Get in there. I want to see Caruso. He's off for the weekend. You know that. Deputy Russell's in charge. Who's Russell? Come on, man. Don't throw me in there. Call Caruso at home, please. Please. [LATCH CLINKING] DANNY: Guard! I can't breathe in here! It stinks! [BANGING ON DOOR] Let me out of here, come on! Guard! I can't breathe! It stinks in here! [BANGING CONTINUES] Come on! Let me out of here. Come on! Guard! Come on, come on. Open up. He's only a kid! I tried telling Russell it was a kid. He said to do like I was told. I want Russell in my office in half an hour. And if he's at home, get him in here! [MUTTERING] Hey. Hey, Danny. DANNY: [SOBBING] I got arrested... Danny, come on. Get yourself up. Let's get out of here. Yeah, it's Caruso. Come on, you hear me? Come on, come on. Come on, let's get out of here! Come on, let's go. We haven't got all day. Come on. That's a boy. All right, come on. I'm okay.Yeah, you're okay. Okay...You're okay. Come on. Yeah, you're okay. You're okay. [GRUNTING] Dupres, get a medical kit and 100 gallons of hot soapy water. Go ahead. Get it! Go ahead! Let me get my shoes. Here, let me get my shoes. Forget it. Don't worry about your shoes. [GRUNTING] Don't worry about your shoes. [SOBBING] Oh, boy, you stink. Hey, there he is!Hey! Dad!Hi, give us a hug! How are you guys? Hi.Hi. Hey, I got something for you boys all the way from Ohio. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. It's not all for you. There we go. Go ahead. Share that up. [CHUCKLES] So?So what? So, so, so?I got the job! Oh! [LAUGHING] Great. When do you start? Ten days.Oh... Oh, don't worry. You can make it. So, what's it like there? Well, it's a lot more built-up than I remember, you know. But it's not bad. There's a lot of nice neighborhoods right around the factory. That's mine there. Thank you.Oh, isn't that great? And I bought this for Danny. Where's he at? I'm sure you're gonna be able to get terrific references for Steven and Ken. They're both good kids... FRANK: Mr. Corcoran. Excuse me. Mr. Corcoran. Listen, I want to tell you something. What you did, keeping my boy here because I was out of town was the worst thing you could have done. That judge ought to be shot!Hey, take it easy. Don't tell me to take it easy! I'm back now. Now, where's the judge? I want to talk to him! All right, Mr. Caldwell. I'm going to give it to you straight. There was some trouble over the weekend.What sort of trouble? Your boy, Danny, picked a fight with another inmate and... Oh, my God! Do you hear that? What is going on around here? Some other queer trying to make a pass at him? What do you people got going on here? The boy's in more trouble since he's arrested than he was back home! Will you listen to me?Now, you listen to me, Mister. I'll tell you something. I want my boy back and I want him back now! I understand, Mr. Caldwell. I'm sorry, but it just can't be done. Why is everyone telling us it cannot be done? We're talking about our son, here. Now I want to see that judge and I want to see him right now! I'm sure he'll be glad to talk to you. But you're gonna have to wait for lunch recess. That's gonna be, uh, about 20 minutes. Fine. We got two more kids waiting downstairs in the car right now. I don't know what to tell you. Nobody around here seems to know what to tell us. I understand exactly how you feel, Mr. Caldwell. FRANK: Well, I don't know if you do, Your Honor. I mean, it's been real hard on everyone. Well, please try to see it from our point of view. I mean, we're not perfect. We make mistakes too. Danny's a very angry boy. Which isn't to say that that's abnormal for his age. I mean, adolescence is a tough time for everybody. Especially parents. Danny has no control over his temper, Mr. Caldwell. Things don't go his way, he gets frustrated, disappointed. Blows up. He's already injured one man and attacked another. I know. I tried to tell him. He's got to learn to control that temper. I tell him all the time, don't I? HALLORAN: Well, that's exactly what we're trying to do. I mean, that's why I want him to stay here until the trial. Now he has a good relationship with Dr. Forman, our psychologist. I really think it's the best thing for him. Now if you want to talk to her about this, please go ahead. Judge Halloran, my husband has a new job, in another state, in Ohio and we're... We're moving. I mean, almost right away. Will Danny be able to... We're not trying to steal your son, Mrs. Caldwell. I just feel it's important that he stays in a structured environment. Especially if you're moving because... Well, until we can redirect his emotional patterns a little. Otherwise, I don't think this experience will be any worth to him. Can we see him now? Of course. I... I think you'd better leave it until tomorrow, because visiting hours are over for today. I appreciate your cooperation, Mr. Caldwell. Thank you, Your Honor. Mrs. Caldwell... Can't put him back in the kitchen. There's no way. Let him stay in the day room for now. He can have his meals in there and get Dr. Forman over. I want her to see him! I want that kid out of here. It's enough. This is Alfred Caruso. Would you have Mike Raines call me the minute he's out of court? Thank you very much. They taking care of this, Danny? Mmm. You know your uncle Alex says the schools are real good there. And Mike, your cousin, Mike's in the same grade as you, remember? You always used to like him. You'll have somebody to show you around. Danny, you have got to stay out of trouble in here. They told us you've got to talk to that doctor, what's her name?Forman. Dr. Forman. You got to work with her. Be as helpful as you can. Do you understand? Yeah. Danny, don't look that way. Darling, we'll be back for you. [CAR ENGINE STARTING] [WATER DRIPPING] Mike Raines call? Ten minutes ago. He's back in court until 5:00. [GRUNTING] [YELLS] I want Danny Caldwell out. I don't care how you do it. I want that kid out of my jail and put someplace else. [MAN CHATTERING] Well? He'll be okay. Uh, he'll be okay. I gave him five units. Stitched up the artery. You know, it's a good thing you got him when you did. What'd you do, beat him with a rubber hose? I need a cup of coffee. When can I see him? He's in recovery right now. He'll probably sleep a couple hours. What's he in for? [SIGHING] How the hell do I know? WOMAN ON RADIO: We're bringing in three kids. We've got a head injury. Looks bad. One internal and a girl with a steering wheel through her chest. Real messy, Doc. What's the pressure? We're getting it. You know, I think some nights, every kid in this town is on self-destruct. Here.Thanks. See you later. Ten days to move! Who would have believed it? But you know, I think I'm glad we're here. I'm glad to hear you say that, honey. [PHONE RINGING] That'll be Jen. She's the only one that's got the number. Can you get it? Yeah, I'll get it, honey. Hello, hi, Jenny. No, we just got in around 7:00. Hey, listen, thanks a lot for turning on the telephone. I really appreciate that. No, I hadn't had time. Why is that? What? [SIGHING] My God! Is he all right? I said, is he all right? [CLEARING THROAT] Yeah, I'll tell her. I'll tell her. Yeah. Thanks, thank you, Jenny. It's Danny. What? He's in the hospital. They say he tried to kill himself. Well, you can't blame the cops for putting him in the tank. Well, what were they going to do? Toss him out on the street at 1:00 in the morning? If his father had come down here and picked him up that night we wouldn't be sitting here talking about this right now. Exactly. With 80 kids, I don't make a great parent either. Well, will Danny be out of the hospital in time for the trial, or should we reschedule? He'll be out Friday. Three days enough time for the probation department to get its act together or do we have to keep this child waiting even longer? Wendy, do you understand that Danny Caldwell is potentially dangerous? He's assaultive! He's resistant to treatment! He doesn't need treatment. He needs to go home. He needs to be punished! He beat up two men in here! How many more did he beat up before we got a hold of him? What do you want to do? You want to toss him out on the street so he can beat up some more people? You think a 16-year-old kid can come in here and learn from isolation and brutalization? [SCOFFS] Impossible. Dr. Forman, I agree Danny's case hasn't been handled very well and I will even admit that very few juveniles are treated in their best interest, no matter how hard we try, but Danny broke the law. I've worked in prisons since I came out of the army. I've seen a lot of men come and go. But kids... The lady's right. Jail's no place for kids. And I'll tell you something. You people had better keep talking, because I'm damned if I'm gonna have any more kids come into my jail. I'll see you later, Wendy. [DOOR OPENING] What're you doing here? What're you doing here? Man... I don't know. I just wanted a way out, you know? I just had to get out. What do you care anyway? Hey, Caruso. Thanks for coming by. See you in jail. See you in jail. Behave yourself. You punk. RAINES: Your Honor, this is the matter of the trial of Daniel Richard Caldwell, charged with driving without a license, driving while intoxicated and two counts of assault and battery. Case number 4407B12. HALLORAN: [SIGHING] Ms. Blake? Your Honor, the state requests that the court rule only on the charges of drunk driving and driving without a permit. Reason? We've been unable to locate the victim of the first assault. We're willing to drop the charge. Mr. Raines, the second assault? Uh, Your Honor, the witnesses' account on this vary considerably. But, uh, Mr. Stremster returned to prison routine almost immediately. Your Honor, considering the drunk driving and driving without a permit charge, the defense requests the court consider time served. Certainly, Mr. Barnes. I feel that 40 days detention is more than reasonable punishment in this case. Court rules accordingly. Danny, you're free to go. [CLEARING THROAT] Mr. Caldwell. Uh, I've been sitting here, listening and... I'm sorry, Mr. Caldwell, I can't hear you. Could you speak up? [CLEARING THROAT] Yes, sir. Excuse me. I said, uh, I've been sitting here, listening and... And I'd just like to say that there's something wrong here, sir. Something awfully wrong. Uh... Danny was never a bad boy, he never liked rules. Of course, you've got to have rules, uh, for things to run right. And his, uh, getting drunk and running into a police car, of course, that's not like sassing his mother, or coming home late. That's a serious, uh, deal, and uh... And I figured there's time for him to straighten up, time to get his attention. And so, I thought a night in jail would do that, but, uh... I was wrong. Judge Halloran. You've got a lot of important people here, uh... We just don't figure Danny has learned a lot from being here, except that he doesn't want to go on living. Now you've had him six weeks now, almost, six weeks. You'd think in that time, that, uh, educated people like you could, have helped him some... With your psychologists and your evaluations and your probation officers and all. Uh, and what did he get out of it? Now Danny was never... Well, sometimes he was difficult to handle. But he never, uh, hurt anybody until he got in here. That's right. And he certainly never tried to hurt himself. I don't know what kind of hell you put our boy through. But I do know one thing. You got no right. [SOBBING] I mean, you got no right at all. And, uh, something is awful wrong when you take a child and you make him look like this. HALLORAN: Mrs. Caldwell, everybody here has done their best for Danny. Well, it's not good enough. No, sir, it's just not good enough. I'm his father. And I know I'm the one who put him here in the first place. And God knows I'm sorry I did that, Son. And all's I can do now is take my son home. But I want to tell you this... That you all ought to take a good, hard look at the way you're treating kids like this. You just ought to take a real good, hard look! Come on, Son. Good luck, Danny. Thanks. SANDY: Hi, guys. Isn't it lovely. We have a disposal and an icemaker and, oh, yes, the dishwasher works. [BOYS CHATTERING] [CLEARS THROAT] How about this carpet? Hey, we got a fire! Danny, marshmallows! That's nice. I... I quit. Come and see your room, darling. [BOYS CONTINUE CHATTERING] It's better than the one you had before. The man at the store said it even has a balance control to have, uh, Dolby sound, whatever that is. I'm sure you know more about it than I do, honey. [SIGHING] Well... You like your room? You can switch with David if you want. No, no, it's fine. It's real nice. Danny... It's so good to have you home again, honey. And we're gonna forget all of this ever happened. We're gonna just put it right behind us. I'll leave you alone. DAVID: This one's sticky. FRANK: What about your mother? Did you make one for your mother? RUSTY: Yeah, I made one. FRANK: All right, let's have it. Ooh, that is hot. I've got two coming up.Mine are getting burned. Yeah, this is Mama's. Ah, it's sticky. Here you go, honey. Open up. Say "Ah." [ALL CHATTERING] FRANK: Is this for Danny? [CHATTERING CONTINUES] [PRISON DOORS CLANGING] [BELL RINGING]
