Wait for me, will you. I won't be long. Is Mrs Mortimer in? And that's the third time. Why do people always drop in for tea when everything's upset and upside down. To say goodbye, Miss. Well, why don't we just write polite notes? Notes want answering. Maybe. But they don't want tea. Hurry up with that, Tibby. Hold the door for me, will you. Hold the other one too. My hat please. You'll find Roger a splendid chap. He'll be a great help to you in Rome, Mr Mortimer. Oh thanks, thanks. But we'll be mostly in Naples. Oh will you? Dellavita has done great work at Pompeii. Yes, I suppose the rewards of an archaeologist must be very satisfying. Unfortunately, the rewards are mostly spiritual. Yes, yes. Thank you, dear. Shirley, Shirley. - Yes? Will you put this in my cupboard. Certainly, father. - Thank you, dear. Thank you. Ah, you have another daughter? You haven't met Shirley? When Shirley returns, I must remind her to remind me to note .. Any material I might run across for her. I'll remember, dear. Dear? You don't always. I'm terribly busy with my own work. My newspaper column. Tuesdays. Do you know, this is the busiest family I've ever known. I hear your shop is booming. Oh it is, rather. Splendid. Managing the manager of a railroad must be quite a task too. Well, I managed to get him to Baden Baden. Really? How nice. Then you will be here alone, eh? - Oh no. I'm popping over to Paris. We're all travelling that far together. Paris. Sounds jolly. Yes, yes, yes. And then I suppose you two go off together? Almost a second honeymoon. Exactly. Don't be absurd. We're taking Shirley. Poor Shirley. - What does she do? Nothing. - Nothing? - Not a darned thing. I suppose it's good to have one of the family who isn't always in in a hurry. Of course. Wouldn't you rather have a whiskey and soda? Of course he would. Would you bring whiskey and soda here. - Certainly. Oh, Shirley. Miss Trent, Miss Trent. This is my other daughter. - Oh. So glad to meet you. - So am I. So glad. So you are Miss Shirley? - Yes. I'm Shirley. Don't forget Mr Trent's whiskey and soda, Shirley. No, of course. May I? - Thank you. You know, Trent. It will be rather nice to get away from London. Rather nice. Where is the soda? Tibby, give me the soda. Thanks. - There. See who it is. I could have swore I'd settled with all the tradesmen. More trouble. Who are you? The Gas Company to see the lady of the house. So you're the gas company? - I am. Well give us a new bill. The last one was wrong. Too late, my girl. My books is all balanced. Yes, well un-balance them. Don't make me laugh. I've got a split lip. I can see myself. Look at the trouble. Look at the time. Look at the meter. Eh? You're pretty free with my girl. That's the young lady of the house. What, her? Blimey, how was I to know that? - "How was I to know that?" But you do know now. Yes, I must say I like living in the temple. It's terribly central you know and quite quiet. Shirley dear, the door. - Oh yes. Yes, and full of illustrious ghosts? Yes. Oh yes, we had plenty of them. Dr Johnson, Boswell, Charles Lamb, etc. Daddy has known people who've been dead much longer. Forgive me for bursting in like this but I had to say goodbye. How is everybody? - Fine. Well .. upset of course. Oh .. Mr Trent .. Miss Fielding. Not Mr "Front Page Harrington murder case Trent"? Yes, I'm defending him. That was the artist whose wife got tight. Slashed his best picture and he came home and did her in? Served her jolly well right. Will they hang him? - Not if I can help it. Good for you. - Yes, it was a ghastly business. Well, thank heavens there were no children. How is your little boy? - Oh, he's fine thank you. Fine. I don't suppose you know of a nice kind nursery governess for him, do you? Wouldn't I do? Yes, you might do. In about twenty years? time. Thanks. I'm afraid she must be middle aged. Why? Well .. She will have to live in my flat. - Oh. [ Bell ] Answer it, Shirley. Oh yes. Well? Well I must be pushing off now. Oh sorry. - Goodbye. Goodbye. Is he married? I believe he was but you don't mention it to him. I must be going too, Daddy. - So must I. Goodbye, Pansy dear. Oh Trent. Trent, I wanted to ask you. By the way, I'm going Piccadilly way. Can't I drop somebody? That is frightfully sweet of you. So nice. - Not all. Delighted. Goodbye. What are you going to do in Rome, Shirley? Do you know, that's just what I was wondering. I shall be out all day and you'll be busy and .. And you'd be tickled to death if I weren't there. Well you needn't worry. Because I'm not going. Don't be ridiculous. Where else can you go? I am going .. I am staying with Marjorie. What? It was too sweet of you to ask me, dear. When did you say I could come? Well .. Will tomorrow be alright? Why, yes. Yes, of course. Why we'd be delighted. But if you don't stay here, where are you going? I'm off to apply for a job. A what? - A job. A place for myself in the world that is my very own for a change. Shirley, what is the matter with you? I am alive. You wouldn't suspect it, would you. The wallflowers can be alive, you know. And when they are, they get very, very sick of their own backyard. What is that revolting thing? This madam, is what the well-dressed governess will wear. The well-dressed ..? I'm going to be nursery governess for Mr Trent. Look at the shoes. Aren't they beautiful? Governess for Mr Trent? But Shirley .. you can't go and lock yourself alone with a man in his flat. No-one could. Oh my dear. You don't know nursery governesses. And you don't know men, do you. Well no. I can't say I've exactly had to brush them off the doorstep. But oh, what's that got to do with it? I want a job. - But why? - Oh .. It will be an adventure. Come on, help me off with this, will you. - Alright. But what do you know of him? Why you only met him for a second. And something happened. Oh, thank you, darling. Afraid? Oh no, dear. The only fear I have is of .. Staying on. At home. Oh, I couldn't. Oh, I wonder if I'll get away with it. Well, how do I look? Like a very old piece of fried bread. Oh thank you. Thank you my darling. Goodbye. Marjorie. - Yes? I think I will have three children. - Really? Oh, not me. No. Only an experienced nursery governess should have children of her own. And of course, she should be married. See, we live in Halifax Square. I think I'll be "Mrs Halifax". How was the cockney? Well .. - Oh. Goodbye to you, dearie. Morning, boys. - Good morning. You'll be careful not to fall in the water, won't you. - Oh, yes. We won't fall in. Good morning, officer. - Good morning, sir. What is it, missus? Is this the Inner Temple? That's right. What can I do for you? Not as though I has to ask. I can see you're another of them nursery governesses. How did you guess? It's written all over your face. Really? Just a minute, missus. I'll let you in. This way, missus. Now, this way. A bit parky, ain't it. There. Sit down by the fire. Mrs ..? - Halifax. The pleasure is mine, Mrs Halifax. Of course, I ain't saying the job ain't gone now. Yes. There was one after the place this morning. A nice bit of crackling, she was. A nice bit of ..? Oh, but that ain't at all what Mr Trent wants. It don't matter what he wants. He's under orders. Same as me. You wait until I call the Commander in Chief. Matilda. - What is it? There is someone come after the Trent job. - Young? Well? No, no. Well .. well, she ain't so very young. You might be signed. Look. The Commander in Chief. Mrs Halifax - Mrs Coggins. How do you do. - How do you do. I'm pleased to meet you. So you've come to look after young master Trent? Then the job ain't gone? Oh, I am glad. Well, I hope you'll suit. I do, really. With my own little brood another boy is more than I can bear. Don't you believe her. - Make the tea, Herbert. Tea? You heard what I said. Tea on the King's birthday? - Tea. Come and sit down, Mrs Halifax. Sit down my dear. Sit down. You're used to children, I suppose. Has some of her own perhaps. Four. Four? Did you begin late or finish early? She had three at one fell swoop. Yes, and five before them. I shan't forget my first in a hurry. I was only nineteen at the time. And believe me. You can't tell me that's a good sign. Oh .. how dreadful. Come away from the cupboard, Herbert. I don't even have to look round to know what he's doing. I suppose you can see what I'm thinking too? As clear as Gordon's Gin. Why don't you give me a trial? Well, if Mr Trent likes you .. I'll make him like me. That's what I'm here for. I mean to say, after all, if he doesn't like me I can't stay anyhow, can I. That's fair enough. Well I'll show you round the flat and then .. Sergeant. The soldiers. You'll see them better outside. - Come on. Don't you love the soldiers. Ain't they handsome. - Very fine. Look at them black ones there. So. So you didn't want to see the soldiers, you didn't? No. No, I'm not much interested. Well, I'm feeling all patriotic. Here, that's my cup, Matilda. You sure I loves you, Herbert? Attention! Here is health unto His Majesty. Come on, Mrs Halifax. [ Telephone ] Excuse me. Hello? Mrs Coggins? Oh yes. Yes, Mrs Coggins? Huh? Oh yes, yes. Yes, you've take a great load off my mind. I see. Yes. What's her name? Mrs .. Halifax? Mrs Halifax. I see. Thanks. What's she like? Oh, I say. Look here, I don't want a freak, you know. What? I see. Well, well. As long as she doesn't frighten the boy. Alright, Mrs Coggins. He agrees. Oh, splendid. And this is the sitting-room. It's a nice room, isn't it. Just like his .. What a lovely floor. I hope the King is enjoying his birthday. You're just dying to see that boy, ain't you? I'm sure I shall love him. - Elsie. Elsie! - Yes, mother? I'm bringing Mrs Halifax to see master Derek. But her room ain't done. Bring him down here in the sitting-room. - Yes, mother. I suppose you couldn't sit with him for half an hour and get your things after? Oh, I should like to. - It would be a great help. He's a nice kid he is. I want to stay here! Derek, you're going to be a good boy. Come on, darling. Come to Mrs Halifax. How do you do, Derek? Quite well, thank you. Don't stare at people. It's rude. Mrs Halifax is going to be your new governess. She doesn't look very new. Don't worry, Mrs Halifax. He's shy with strangers. Just like his father. We'll leave you two together. Don't stare, Elsie. It's rude. We are going to be great friends, you and I. Aren't we? Well, if Daddy likes you, I will. Well then, you've got to help him to like me. There. That looks better doesn't it. Yes. It looks better. Now what do you mean by that? Here is Daddy. Oh, I must go and wash my hands. You've washed your hands. - You .. Hello Daddy! Hello there. Hello. I'm awfully glad to see you. - And so am I. I say, you do look tired. Yes. You know, I feel tired. For two whole hours I've stood up in a stuffy courtroom and gassed and gassed. Did the judge like your speech? - No, he did not. And what sort of a .. Hello. What sort of a day have you had, eh? - She would put it there. She? Who? - Mrs Halifax. Oh, Mr Halifax. Your new governess, eh? From what Mrs Coggins said, she sounds a bit moth-eaten to me. Oh no, she can't be moth-eaten. - No? Her dress just reeks of camphor. Are you going to like her? - Uhuh. Well then, that is all that matters isn't it, eh. You tell her to come in at seven o'clock will you. I've got to work now. Daddy. No, no. Please run along old chap, will you. Alright, Daddy. - That's right. You run along. Ahem. Mr Trent. Oh, how do you do, Mrs Halifax. I say, would you mind coming in later. I'm pretty busy just now. Oh yes, sir. I'll just leave your tea. I'm dining early. I really don't need anything. Don't you think, just a cup? Alright. Leave it there will you. Milk, sir? Yes please. Milk, milk. And two lumps of camphor. Sugar. Sugar, I mean. Will that be all, sir? Yes, that will be all. Fine. Thank you. - Thank you, sir. Goodnight, Daddy. Goodnight old boy. Goodnight. Please bless me and Daddy. And Mrs Coggins. And Mr Coggins. And aunt Maude in Eastbourne. And Mrs Halifax. Thank you, dear. Don't mention it. And when we die may we all go to heaven. Splendid. No-one could possibly overlook that. - I know they couldn't either. Is the hot-water bottle too hot? Oh no. I like it. It will keep my feet warm - That's good. Didn't you leave one person out of your message? Who? Your Mummy. Oh, she is in heaven .. already. Ahem. Shush. Goodnight, Daddy. Goodnight, Derek. It's the toughest case I've known. We've got to work, David. We have indeed. I suppose there is no doubt that Harrington did kill his wife? Well, I wouldn't say that. Remember. She was a dipsomaniac. Yes, but I don't see that .. - Of course you don't. You've never been married to one. There is nothing they won't do once they get violent. You mean that .. If he hadn't done .. what he did .. She might have killed him? - Yes. Or more probably. Killed herself. Does it often take them that way? Oh yes, they hold it over you day and night. That's what makes it so hideous. You've got to give in to them in everything. Do what they want. Like whom they like. Hate whom they hate. Well, perhaps Harrington didn't give in. But do you think you can convince the jury of that? I ought to be able to. You see, I know what I'm talking about. Only too well. Do you mean .. your own wife? Yes. [ Clock chime ] [ Clock chime ] Mr Trent. Hello, Mrs Halifax. What are you doing up at this hour? I hope you won't mind, sir. But I thought you'd be needing a little something to keep you going. Bouillon. You would like some, wouldn't you. Well .. It's terribly kind of you, Mrs Halifax. But I really don't want it. Really. Don't you think it would be good for you? Oh, and you have been smoking too much. Possibly, possibly. Isn't there anything I could do? Do? You are terribly worn, aren't you. Look here. You get me some brandy, will you. But do you think that will be as good for you as bouillon? What's that got to do with it if I want brandy? But don't you think you should take the best things for yourself? Alright. I'll take the bouillon. Better go to bed now. Couldn't I just stay and see if you like it? Mrs Halifax. Isn't it sufficient that I drink the bouillon? Do I have to like it, too? Goodnight. Don't you think it would be better if you went to bed, Mr Trent? I've too much to do. But isn't that just the point? Wouldn't you get more done if you gave it a fresh go in the morning? Oh please go to bed, sir. Mr Trent. Ah well, I suppose it would be simpler. Indeed it would. And .. And please sleep well. Rest assured, Mrs Halifax. I'll do my very best. Goodnight, sir. Goodnight. All I've done is cheat you out of a good hanging. You can't possibly want my picture. You might look straight down into the camera, sir. I will see you later. Trent. I've been wanting to thank you very much. Can't you people quit rubber-necking just for one minute. Why don't you go quietly home now. Yes. It would be lovely if I could stop at your house. Of course I would be delighted. You know where I live: Tree Well Walk. Shall we say about 5 o'clock? - 5 o'clock. That's fine. See you at 5 o'clock then, Mr Trent. Thank you so much for getting me off. Always changing his mind. What is it? Telegrams for Mr Trent, Miss. - I'll take them. Any answer, Miss? - Not if I know it. One moment, I want to see Mr Trent. Who are you? - Daily Mail. He's gone down to the country. - You don't say so? But I am from the Daily Mail. - I'm sorry. [ Telephone ] Yes? Oh no, Mr Trent has gone down to the country. Yes. Why did you say that? He'll need his rest and I won't have him bothered. Here he is. Now mind you congratulate him nicely. You bet I will. Oh Daddy .. I'm so glad. Are you? Thanks, old chap. Thank you. How did you know? - Mrs Halifax. She guessed. Oh you did, did you? Well, you're always right. Well, we pulled it off, didn't we. - We, sir? - Yes. She's blushing. Why so you are. Go on, Mrs Halifax. You know, you look twenty years younger. That's funny. What is funny, Mr Trent? You know, just for a moment, you reminded me of someone. Why don't you just slip into this and relax now? Hmm .. yes, thank you. What on earth ..? Yes. Thank you. Your slippers, sir. I wish I could place that girl. Here. [ Telephone ] Hello? No. Mr Trent has gone down to the country. Here, what is the idea? Mrs Halifax won't have you bothered. Mrs Halifax? How do you do. - I'm afraid Mr Trent is not in. Now wait a minute. My name is Harrington. Mr Trent invited me. Oh. Come in, Mr Harrington. - Thank you. So sorry, not you. You will excuse me, Mr Harrington. He is dreadfully tired. You won't stay long, will you. Well, not if you think I shouldn't. Mr Harrington. Oh, hello Harrington. Come in. This is very nice. - Thank you. This is Derek, the son and heir. - Why, how do you do. Quite well thank you. With a father like yours, you've plenty coming. Mrs Halifax. - Yes, we met before. Come along, darling. Mr Harrington wants to talk to Daddy. Oh, that hour this morning I spent while the jury was out. I know. You know, I rather bent over backwards for you from the first. You see, I know what an unhappy marriage means. Well. Oh well, forget about it. Come on, sit down. - Thank you. You know, I think we ought to celebrate. How about it? I know I should. - Hmm. A good headache would be a pleasure. That's what we are celebrating. Look at this. Cocktails. Well, if they're real I'll know I'm alive. I thought it might make you feel a bit at home, Mr Harrington. Don't I get one? I've got you whiskey and soda. You see Harrington, she doesn't really approve of cocktails. Mr Trent needs concentration and a clear brain. No American drinks for you, sir. They're too full of surprises. There you are, Harrington. You see how we win our cases. Well, that clear brain certainly worked this morning, Mrs Halifax. There was one point, Mrs Halifax. It was swell. You know, when you appealed to the women on the jury? That is an idea I got from Mrs Halifax. You don't say. Do you think she would mind if I kissed her? I'll bring you another cocktail, sir. A quaint type, isn't she. - Yeah. You know, before you came I paid her a compliment. Something, I forget what. And would you believe it, she blushed like a girl. I'd like to paint her. What, Mrs Halifax? - Yes. My dear chap. I don't know. Maybe you're right. You know, there is more in that face than meets the eye. Yes. Yes .. I'll say there is. May I see it? Oh no. It's nothing. Just an idea I have. A rough sketch. I know. But a rough sketch by Harrington .. Well .. Thanks. Harrington. - Hmm? Did you ..? I say, who is this? Anyone in particular? No. Just a girl. Just a girl. Just a girl, huh? Your cocktail. - Thank you. Mrs Halifax, you know you've made a great hit. I have? - Hmm. Mr Harrington wants to paint your portrait. Oh. When do we start? Tomorrow afternoon? Tomorrow? Oh, I really couldn't tomorrow. Mr Trent. If you don't mind I was going to ask you for the evening off anyhow. If it's all the same to you, sir. - Might I ask why? To meet my father. He's come up to London for a day or two. Your father, eh? - Yes, sir. But of course you must meet your father. But that needn't prevent you from taking the afternoon. You see, Derek is to visit his aunt in the country. Nothing to stop you, Mrs Halifax. Thank you, sir. - Not at all. Well, I'll .. I'll leave you two to settle it between you. Excuse me, won't you. Tomorrow, hmm? - Well .. Well, if it really would be helping you, Mr Harrington. Just as I am? - Yes. Just as you are. Gerrard 9-9-3-4 please. Let me speak to Mr Mortimer please. Hello, Mr Mortimer. This is Trent. I'll be delighted to dine with you tomorrow. Yes. Eight o'clock. The Plaza. It will be an unusual pleasure. Yes, thanks. Right. Hmm. That's fine. You can step down, Mrs Halifax. May I help you? How .. how did you ever happen to marry a man by the name of Halifax? Why, I don't know just how to take you, Mr Harrington. Don't you? It's quite simple. You are the problem. Might I see the picture? Yes. I'm not satisfied with it yet. - It looks like me. It does not. After I finish with this study I should like to paint you as you really are. What? Will you take off that atrocious wig? Mr Harrington, what are you saying? That you are the most interesting girl I've met .. Since I got out of jail. You haven't been out of jail long. And I am not a girl. - You are. You're a swell girl. But you are a bum make-up artist. Mr Harrington, I .. You know .. I frighten you, don't I. Now don't let me. Because whoever you are. I am at your service. I suppose they are mighty particular in The Temple. You think that .. You think that Mr Trent and I .. That while I've been living in that flat. That Mr Trent has known what you've found out? Well, it's none of my business. - Answer me. So, to Mr Trent .. You are just "Mrs Halifax"? Just Mrs Halifax. I'm sorry. That's quite alright. It ain't your fault really. Listen. There is one thing I want you to know. This little secret of yours. - Well? Is just as safe with me as it has been with you. Thank you, Mr Harrington. There you are, darling. - Shirley, dear. How are you? - Just fine. How is Mummy? Oh, very flourishing. A little worried over this position that you have taken. Exactly what is it that you are doing? Oh let?s not talk about me, Daddy. I want to talk about you. Tell me .. tell me about this excavation of yours. Oh yes .. it was a tablet. Just a fragment, you know. But inscribed on it .. Was one of the laws of the first Roman Emperor. Pious Octavius Augustus. What sort of a law? - Well, well, well .. It was discarded as impractical in the year 63 BC. I never knew laws had to be practical. I have a distinguished colleague dining with us tonight. Who may be able to throw further light on the subject. Oh really. Who is it? - David Trent. Mr Trent? - Yes. He called at the house the day before we left. Were you there? I don't remember. Were you? There you are, Trent. How do you do, Mr Mortimer. This is awfully nice. Oh, not at all my dear fellow. I need your help really. Yes. An Augustan tablet. 63 BC. - You don't say. I do say my dear fellow, I do. Oh, I'm sorry. My daughter, Shirley. How do you do? - But of course. We met once before didn't we? Just for a second. Oh yes. I believe we did. Yes, I know we have. - Well, shall we go in? Shall we? - Yes, let's go in. I'm all for cocktails. Aren't you, Miss Shirley? Yes, I .. I think sometimes they are a necessity. Yes. I think so too. You know, I like these American drinks. They are so full of surprises. To our better acquaintance. It's a long time since I had three cocktails. Ah, but then you see, you're not hen-pecked at home. I must say that .. This Mrs Halifax of yours sounds a regular tartar. Well not that exactly, but when she puts her foot down. Something has got to go. Is it such a very big foot? - Colossal. Won't you? - Thank you, thank you. Shirley? - Thanks. You know. If she caught me smoking. Between courses .. - What would she do? Why are you so interested? Well you see, in a sort of a way I'm in service myself. Shirley. My daughter has some sort of a position. She looks after a .. What kind of a person do you look after, Shirley? A very old woman, Daddy. Fixed ideas and a fixed routine. Breakfast on the tick, tea on the tick. Etc, etc. You know. But when middle age comes, one can't much help being a bit fussy, can one. My dear child, how should Mr Trent know? No of course not. How could he. You know, I've a mind to fire myself from my job and come and look after you. Shirley! - I wish you would. What a pity they are so strict in The Temple, isn't it? Yes. - Yes. Well. Could she come to tea one day? I should think so. If Mrs Halifax is there. Oh yes .. she'll be there. You know, you dance like a dream. You are not so bad yourself. When shall I see you again? - Who knows. Tell me, where do you live? I'm not allowed any followers. Of course. Well, hasn't Mrs Halifax any followers? Who knows? What are you staring at? Nothing. Just that husband of mine. - What? Oh, don't be alarmed. I haven't even seen him for four years. Do you mind very much if I tell you I like you? Sounds a bit lukewarm to me. Suppose I show you how lukewarm I really am? Don't you think we'd better stop? Why? Well, the music has. What? Oh yes. So it has. How absurd. Why not? If I bring you here you must behave yourself. Will you sit down. Certainly. Let's have the next shall we. Oh, I am sorry .. I must be going. No, no. Please, please. Mr Mortimer, do try and persuade her. - No. You see, I really have to be in by eleven. But I'll drop you. - Oh no. I'm quite sure you'd much rather I saw her home. It's very kind of you, but our little talk? Of course. Meet me tomorrow at the Garrick? - The Garrick? - Yes. Excellent. I'd much rather go by myself. - No, no. No, no. Send someone to get me a taxi will you. Oh really, Mr Trent. - No. Don't be ridiculous. Of course I'll see you home. Well. Here you are, sir. 138 Brock Street. Wait for me. I won't be a minute. It was awfully good of you to bring me home, Mr Trent. Thanks so much. Goodnight. I'll see you in. Give me the key. I'll open the door. What's the matter? - The key? I'm not allowed any followers, you know. Not allowed any what? Followers. - Followers? Oh, alright. Alright. My door is down here. Goodnight. Down there? No, don't go. Wait. Wait. Shall we dine .. soon? I'll think it over. - Will you? Alright. - Goodnight. No, no. Don't. Not yet. Goodnight. Alright. Goodnight. Goodnight. Goodnight. Drop me at The Temple, will you. Very good, sir. You are very late, Mrs Halifax. Why aren't you asleep? Did you expect me to be? Have you ..? Have you known all evening that .. Mrs Halifax and I were .. Were me? I have. Then you've just been making fun of me? - No, no, no. No, I couldn't do that. Ever. Not even in that hat. Suppose we .. Ah, that's better. It never did suit you, really. What are you doing? Mrs Halifax. Is dead. Long live Shirley. There isn't very much I can say, is there. Oh, but there is. Come and sit down. I feel like such a fool. Of course, I've known all along that this was bound to happen. And I always imagined that when it did there would be the most perfect scene. And now it's here and I .. I just don't know what to do about it. Well. Perhaps I can help you? You really belong here, you know. It all seems very sensible. Sensible? Oh dear. I've never liked that word very much. I suppose tonight would be rather a good time for me to start remembering. Yes, it would. And the first thing to remember. Is always to look like you. And promise to stay here forever. Didn't you like Mrs Halifax? Oh yes. Oh, I liked Mrs Halifax. But I love Shirley. You don't have to say that, you know. Oh, but I do. It isn't very much to offer you Shirley, but .. Most of my life is before me. And I want you to take it. Will you? I just .. I just can't believe you care for me like that. I love you so much and I want you so much that .. Tonight I am going to say something I hate to say. What? 138 Brook Street. Now? Now. Good morning, Mr Coggins. - Aha. The morning after the night before, eh? You will have your little joke, Mr Coggins. Joke? You'll hear all about jokes from the Commander-in-Chief. Why, is anything wrong? She knows all. She knows ..? What does she know? You'd better come inside, dearie. Of course you know I ain't saying that I agreed with her absolutely. Oh, no. Now, what I says is .. If folks wants to have a bit of fun now and again why shouldn't they have it. What do you mean by "fun"? Come inside, ducky. Who was you with last night, dearie? Really, Mr Coggins. Well. Why didn't you tell me Mrs Halifax was here? I've only just come. High time too, I should say. Sit down, Mrs Halifax. You and I have got to have a heart to heart talk. And what about, Mrs Coggins? - About last night. Mrs Halifax, where did you spend last night? With my father. With her father. Of course. - Oh? Really, Mrs Coggins. And you and I such good friends too. I come back to ask Mr Trent if I might. And seeing as how the boy is away, he said I could. So he walks with me down to the gate and puts me into a taxi. Always the little gentleman. So. He sent you home to your father, I suppose? Of course he did. Come along, Mrs Coggins. Come up to the flat and I'll make you a nice cup of tea. I'm sorry Mrs Halifax, I can?t let you into that flat. Oh, and why not? Because Mr Trent said that he wasn't expecting you back. Oh, he can't have, Mrs Coggins. There must be some mistake. Oh, must there? Very well then, we'll see about that. You stick to that about your father, dearie. Why, that's awfully nice of you, Arthur. If I'm free I'd love to dine with you. When will you let me know? I should think about five. - Good. Just a minute. Hello? Yes, Mrs Coggins? Oh, she's back, is she? Oh, that's fine. What? Well, of course let her in. Why of course! What are you thinking about? Well, you are all wrong. Yes .. tell her I'll be .. Tell her I'll be over as quickly as I can. Goodbye. Arthur, I'm awfully sorry. I'm afraid I shan't be free. Oh. Yes. Hello Coggy. Missus. Come here. Here, I just seen him. He come home and went in. - Mr Trent? Mr Trent, yes. He came around this way. He's gone in there by his self, too. Good evening, Mrs Halifax. Oh it's you, Mr Trent. All so sudden like. You gave me quite a turn you did. I'm so sorry, Mrs Halifax. May I ask what you are doing in my kitchen? Just wishing it were your kitchen. Oh give over, Mr Trent. You surprise me. You are a liar, Mrs Halifax. - Oh, Mr Trent. Really, I don't take no liberties from my employers. Alright then. You're fired. And now that I am no longer your employer. I will go and pack my things. - Do. I'm expecting a lady to dinner. A beautiful lady. So beautiful that I don't want anybody to disturb us. I couldn't resist that. - Ah. Allow me. Well. What do you think of it? - Sweet. - Yes? All it needs is one deft little womanly touch. Look here, are you left-handed or am I? Why what ..? - Look. The knives on the right, forks on the left. Of course. Look what I've done. - That's nothing. Just the deft little womanly touch. Wretch. Sit down. You sit down. I am so used to waiting on you. But I want to get so used to waiting on you. Besides, that's not the only reason. Oh? - Oh, no. Lobster salad, Madame? - Please. Apparently, everything comes to him that waits. Don't be a fool. You think I am a fool? Another leading question. Well. No. So sorry. How careless of George. I beg your pardon, sir. Oh, wine on the right, George. - Beg your pardon, madam. Here is to the actor. Same to you, ma'am. You don't know very much about me, do you. All I want to know. I know, but not all. I should have told you really. You don't have to tell me anything. - Oh, but I do. Perhaps .. in two minutes. You won't .. think I'm quite so nice. Oh yes I will. Don't you be too sure of that. Would it help you if I kissed you first? I think it would. Oh. I suppose the polite thing to say would be "pardon me". How did you manage to get in? I woke up Coggins. It wasn't the first time I've had to. Why did you come? - For the same two reasons .. Probably, as your young friend here. A full heart and an empty purse. Don't be alarmed, my dear. I shan't make a scene. Supposing you tell your friend she can go. I've come back for good this time, darling. Look here. You don't understand. I suppose he's been telling you that I don't understand him. Did you ever meet a man who was understood .. By his wife? His wife? His ..? Shirley. Shirley. Oh what a dramatic young person. What do you want? Much more than I did when I came. After all, I suppose I have a certain right. Well, what do you want? That's better my sweet. How is it coming? Oh fine, fine. Like all of our work. For the week you've been sitting for me. Gosh, what a lucky break for me when you came along. And gosh, what a lucky break for me when you did. I've never earned so much money in my life. What good is money? None, I suppose. Unless you want to be free. And stay free. And sit still and earn some more money. How is Trent? I don't know. I haven't seen him lately. Still love him? I never said I loved him, did I? Do you? No. Do you know why I am so fond of you? Are you fond of me? Because you lie so beautifully. You are just terrible. No I'm not. No, I'm a regular guy. With an appreciation of all the arts. Lying included. After all, lying is an art. And a very important one. I think if you wrote all the liars out the history books .. There would only be Washington left. I hope. Well, when I was a very small child. Lying was punished by a mouthwash of soap. Are you in love with Trent? No. Darned if I don't believe you. Thank you. Will you mind saying that you're in love with me? And I won't use a soap no matter if you do earn it. What .. what do you want? Would an Ouija board be of any use to you? I want to get away from London. A long way away. Where? Just away. That's a nice place. I'll go with you. I always wanted to go there. No. Mr Trent, may I speak to you, sir? Yes, certainly. What is it? Well, what with one thing and another. I'm all of a flutter. Why? Why, Mrs Coggins? Well, I ain't your servant and I don't want to be hard. But I've all my own work to do so you'll have to get someone in. You will, really. - Alright. Alright. I'll take the next that applies. I am very glad to hear it, sir. - Yes. What is that you've got in your hand? - Oh that? Mrs Halifax left that behind, sir. Oh. She did, did she. But you don't want it, do you, sir? I do want it. Why don't you get her back? - Hmm? Oh, it's you, is it. Any more questions? Yes. Have you tried to find her? I have. Then why didn't you? - Because I .. Here, do you mind letting me get on with my work? Alright. Hello, what's the idea? You won't do much work until you get her back. What's the good? She won't even see me. I thought you were a great man. Yes. And so did I. Once. And now look at me. Oh well. I'll tell Mr Harrington you are here, sir. Thank you. Please. - Thank you. Well, well, Trent. How are you? How are you, Harrington? - Fine. You? Splendid. I was just passing on my way to dinner. - So you dropped in, huh? So I dropped in. Great. I'm glad you did. Sit down. - Thanks. Well, I .. I must congratulate you. Thank you, thank you. Cigarette? - Thank you. By the way. Where is she living these days? How should I know. You mean you won't tell me? Why don't you drop a line to .. Brook Street. I have. She hasn't answered. Yet. I know. Well if you know, why suggest I write? Because I don't mind if you .. write. Oh, you don't mind? - No. Where do you come in? Oh, Shirley and I have reached an understanding. What sort of an understanding? See here. Since you kept her in your flat .. for weeks. I see no point in you acting the noble big brother for me. I intended to marry her. Even a lawyer knows a man can't have two wives. I .. I am trying to arrange all that. I know. And Shirley can't have two husbands. Two? - Hmm. I might object. You? - Hmm. You mean Shirley is going to marry you? Uhuh. So it would seem. I've got to see her. Try. It wouldn't make any difference. In fact. There is one thing I'd like to hear you explain. If you can talk yourself out of that. You are a better lawyer than I think you are. And I think you're a good lawyer. You do? - Yes. Thank you. - You're welcome. Well, after all. You did convince the jury for me, didn't you. Yes, I did. Worse luck. Charming. Yes. A charming girl. Yes. Well, here. I'm sorry, old man. If she loved you .. I might think twice. But she doesn't. How do you know she doesn't? She told me so. I'm sorry to tell you this. That's very considerate of you. Goodnight. - Goodnight. Think of it, Shirley. Brittany. Algiers. The Italian lakes. Isn't that a beautiful picture? Just you and I. On our honeymoon. What do you say, huh? Oh, I don't know. But Shirley, I am so crazy about you. I know Norman, but .. I'm not kidding myself that you are that way over me. Well then .. Then how can you want me to marry you? Marry? Did I ask you to marry me? No. No you didn't. Goodbye. Shirley, now wait. Just a moment. Just a moment. Shirley. Well why? It is all very clear isn't it. You made me a most generous proposition and .. I'm greatly honoured, naturally. But I .. I just don't happen to feel that way. Goodbye. Shirley, you .. You will of course leave your address, hmm? No. I don't think I'll do that either. Shirley. Now .. As long as you must think. How would it be if you would think of me? You are a great temptation, Norman. But no. Spring hasn't been quite what it might have been this year. Well here we are, Miss Shirley. Back again. Yes. The same old cups. And the same old cupboards. I wonder you put up with it. What else can I do? - Do? Why, when I was a girl, what didn't I do. In love one day, out again the next. Why, when I was your age I was married to my Angus. Were you happy, Tibby? For ten whole years. He called me his bluebell. Did he? Well. It's better than being a wallflower isn't it, Tibby. A Mr Harrington, mum. - Harrington? Harrington? Harrington. You don't suppose it is the Harrington? What a thrill. Show him in. I say. My name is Mortimer. Mortimer? That's great. I came to see your daughter. Hmm? I am Mrs Mortimer. Which of my daughters did you come to see? How do you do, Mrs Mortimer. I came to see Shirley. You came to see Shirley? Yes. Sure. I could think of nothing but hot lips. Hot lips? That's what I said. The horse, you know. 50-1 on the Derby. - Oh .. Shirley. Hello there, Marjorie. Hello yourself. I've got a surprise for you. What is it? - Harrington is here. Is he? Well, how did he find my address? - You'd better go in and ask him. Shirley, he seems awfully nice. Oh does he? You must be .. Very grateful to our friend Trent. Oh, I'll say I am. Cute, isn't he. He can kill me any time he likes. Well hello, this is awfully nice. Gee, I'm certainly glad to see you. Sit down, Mr Harrington. Mr Harrington. Thank you. Thank you. Shirley, Shirley. Sit down, Shirley. Oh, thank you. And how did you meet my little daughter? Quite by chance. And a lucky chance for me. Do you see much of each other? Oh yes. Thank you. Yes .. I induced your daughter to sit for me. As a model? Yes, of course. - But my dear Harrington .. Don't worry, darlings. It was only for the head and shoulders. How do you feel about it, Emmet? Well, he's a well-known man. You .. You've been thinking? Uhuh. And what do you think? About our getting married, I mean. Mr Trent, Mum. - Trent? But how delightful. Show him in. Oh, my dear fellow. - How do you do. I dropped in to congratulate you. - Have you been seeing him? - No. Hello Mrs Mortimer. How do you do. How do you do. - How do you do. Hello, Harrington. - Hello. I didn't know you knew .. And how do you do? Quite well thank you. If you will excuse me. - Shirley, where are you going? I have to see the man about the furniture, mother. Well, tell Tibby to see him and come right back. And Shirley, bring a cup for Mr Trent. Wouldn't you rather have a cocktail? No. Tea, please. Really? Well Trent, I've dug up a thing that may interest you enormously. Oh yes? - Yes. It's what has frankly amounted to an early .. Your cup. - Oh, thank you. Shirley. I must see that man about the furniture, mother. I wish you to stay and entertain Mr Trent. Yes. Please do. Well. And how is Mrs Trent? Shirley! You must forgive her, Mr Trent. There is nothing to forgive. As a matter of fact, I'm very happy to supply the information. My wife called on me unexpectedly. Four weeks ago. That must have been rather a shock. Well it was, rather. Particularly as I hadn't seen her for .. Four years. You .. You hadn't seen her for four years? - No. No, I had not. And then to walk in suddenly like that, at midnight. What a time to call. You might have been seriously compromised by your own wife. Well, as a matter of fact I was. Extraordinary how people jump to conclusions. Isn't it. And isn't it a lucky thing for us that they do. If they didn't, there would be no trouble in the world. Think of that. And then nobody would want a lawyer. I suppose you will want one for your divorce? Oh, I hardly think so. She is not going to defend. It ought to go through pretty quickly. Then all of us girls will be wanting a lawyer. I wouldn't say that. Well, I .. Think I've said all that I wanted to. Goodbye, Mrs .. Goodbye. Shirley, what are you whispering to Marjorie? Oh. Would you like me to repeat it? - Yes. Well, what I said was .. If you are in love with ? man. And you've made a horrible mistake. And you hate him too much to adm?t it. What do you do? You .. You need a lawyer, don't you .. Mrs Halifax? Oh, give over, Mr Trent. * steve d *
