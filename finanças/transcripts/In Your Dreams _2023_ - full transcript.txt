Oh, Pelin! - The guy's married now too. - Calm down. You'll get married. I could explode. I'm sure they're doing it on purpose. I'm going. Call me, okay? This is my cousin's tenth wedding post in her bronze dress. Take a photo of me. I want to send her something pretentious. - What for? - She's too in love with herself. Take one of me standing up, okay? You're doing this every time on the ferry. Make it look like I'm flying. Go on, exaggerate it. I don't believe it! It's a sign! It's a sign! Merve, what are you doing? Give me that. You go crazy over flowers. You yell, "Say yes!" whenever someone kneels. How could I not? Mum hassles me, the neighbours nag, colleagues press me, - Mercury's in retrograde, so I freak out. - Okay, calm down. How can I calm down? I'm over 30, the clock is ticking. Merve! Here. Sorry. Excuse us. Merve, sit down. Did you have a fight with Eda? She said you were unreachable yesterday. I don't want to be reachable. Don't push it. She must be worried. She expects something else. What? She asked the forbidden question. - What question? - The question. - "Where..." - "...is this heading?" Oh no! Why do they all want to know where the relationship is going? All of Istanbul got married thanks to us, and we're left out. The cobbler's children have no shoes. - What happened there? - An accident. When you get on a bus, you don't ask the driver where he's going. It says "We're not headed to marriage" on this bus. I'm not a taxi. I have a fixed route. You can get on, or not bother. That's all. Oh, there's been a serious accident. Sometimes when I wake up I wish my husband was lying beside me. And that we'd grow old together. Manifesting it. That would be a nightmare for me. Why? "In sickness and in health, for better, for worse..." It's like a poem. He should be moderately rich. Manifesting it. You're out of your mind. Merve, slowly but surely, you're losing your mind. Go see a doctor. You constantly talk about marriage. Check out that guy. Then all the tears and wailing. As if I'd promised her something. I'm bailing out soon. What am I supposed to do? Don't obsess about it, and you'll be fine. Take a deep breath. Close your eyes. What do you see? - My wedding! - No, Merve. No. You see a woman standing strong and proud over this huge city. As big as the Statue of Liberty, bachelorette torch in hand. An army of men at your feet, looking at you with envy. She wanted to do couples therapy with me. Couples therapy? With you? What's next? I mean, you're right. But I don't know... - I think it's time. - Time for what? Out every night? That's no life. A warm home, a steady life... - Sounds good to me. - Ah, I get it. Give marriage a try. I have friends who are married. They're all happy. The institution of marriage is a mysterious thing. - They tell you nothing. And why? - Why? Why don't you give up? We're staying put! No progress without change. The building will be demolished. You have to vacate. We're offering you a luxury apartment in return. - My kids were born here. I won't let you. - Do what you like. We're not going anywhere! Imagine that you're on a trip with friends. You anchor your yacht in a beautiful cove. You want to swim and you jump in the water. Millions of needles prick your skin. It's ice-cold. You're this close to swearing out loud. At that moment, your friends ask what the water's like. You have two options. You can say, "Don't get in, it's freezing." Or, just as your married friends would do, you can say, "Hey, it's great. Jump in." This is what marriage is all about, Cihan. Seriously, forget about marriage. Remember tonight, Emre's new place with the girls. Honey, don't be so pessimistic. Everything will come in time. But we don't have time. The 24 hours in a day isn't enough. - How come? - Eight hours' work. Eight hours' sleep. The two-hour commute puts us on 20 hours. - How many does that leave? - Four. No. There's showering, make-up, manicure, shopping... By my count that leaves 2 minutes and 41 seconds. Eye contact, talking, falling in love. All in 2 minutes and 41 seconds? You're exactly 2 minutes and 41 seconds late. - It wasn't us, it was the bus. - Whatever. - A client complained about you. - Why? You argued with yet another groom about the car sign. Well, I was a bit harsh. But he wanted to put this sign on the car. How can anyone be okay with that? You have to have something romantic. We organize weddings. Our clients' wishes are our top priority. If they want it that way, keep your opinions to yourself. If I get another complaint, you'll be fired. Is that clear? - "Taking the bride". What the hell? - I think it's funny. Good morning. Glad you're here. Sadettin Akman wants to meet with you. - Put him off. - But it's important! The opening of the new sales office in Maslak is in two hours. Okay. - Mr Rauf wants to discuss the contract. - Not convenient. The last building comes down tomorrow in the regeneration project. - Have them do what's necessary. - Fine. And your girlfriend Eda has been trying for two days to reach you. No way! Tell her I'm in a meeting. She's waiting for you in your office. Darling. - Eda? - Sit down. Why aren't the menus inside? This looks ridiculous. What are you doing? Leave them on top! Guests want to see the menus when they arrive. That woman has it in for me. If this was my company, I'd have her serve tea. I've half a mind to quit, but I won't. Put the menus inside please. - I'll need your stamina tonight. - What's happening tonight? A new posh place opened recently. Maybe we'll find the love of our lives there. Shall we go? Me in a posh place? Why do you never listen to me? What are we doing here? We only have 2 minutes and 41 seconds. Be patient please. And now for the surprise of the evening. Oh, you lucky things. Chef Engin is cooking tonight in person. I'm manifesting. My message to the universe is sent. I wonder what surprise awaits me in the next 2 minutes and 41 seconds. Look to your left. You'll see. Come. The dreams we had, Engin. You wanted to open a restaurant. I wanted to be my own head chef. Everything at the right time. Right. Now you're a top boss. One has to get past seven secretaries to see you. You only came tonight for the girls. - Exactly 2 minutes and 41 seconds. - Very well. Whose lovely hands are these? - May I know your name? - Pelin. Pelin. What a meaningful name. Such grace. You're a Sagittarian, right? - What's your ascendant? - My blood pressure! You know, the idea still appeals to me. One day I'll have a restaurant. I'm in! Shall I tell you something? I found a great place. For rent, with a big garden. I've thought of everything. We'll start as soon as you agree. Your green necklace brings out the colour of your eyes. Your white shirt brings out the colour of your beard, old man. Two minutes have already passed. - We'll be stuck with them if we don't go. - Let's go. - What do we do now? - Come with me! Yes? We need to leave. Where is the exit? - You're so beautiful. - Who are you? - I don't remember you either. - How did I get here? - Since when have I had this on my finger? - Can we keep calm? How should I know how long you've had your wedding ring? Shit! Shit! What's this? - What is it? - Can we keep calm? Did we go to the jeweller's last night or what? What night? What jeweller? Where are my clothes? Why am I wearing this nightdress? What did you do to me? What did I do? You bring me to yours and ask me that? - I don't live here! - Neither do I. If you don't live here, why are we here? Who lives here? Why did we wake up in bed together? I don't understand any of this! Good morning. I brought what you ordered. The whole wheat bread for Ms Pelin. This is for her too. Soya milk and probiotic yoghurt. Blueberries and the kombucha. There you are. What is kombucha? Did we order these? Is there a mistake? Never mind, I'll take it back. Just a moment. Do we know each other? That was harsh, Mr Engin. It's the first time I've got the delivery wrong. One question... Is this house mine? For God's sake! I should hope so! What? - We're really married. - For two years. My mother. Mum? - Baby, I didn't wake you up, did I? No, no. It's fine. Mum, I need to ask you something. Ask me, my dear. Mum, am I married? Did I get married? Somebody really isn't awake yet. Have you been dreaming, my child? Of course you're married. How is my son-in-law, Engin? - Engin? Is that your name? - Engin. Is everything okay, darling? Don't let the taste of marriage go bad, sweetheart. May God give us the chance to see our grandchildren. Will you two be home this evening? Will we be home? - Mum, I'll call you back later. - Of course, honey. Yes, I'm hanging up. I almost let on about the party tonight! I'm surprised you didn't! - Good grief. - All right. It's meant to be a surprise. I never wear clothes like these. How embarrassing is this? Is your surname Taşkıran? Like "Stonecrusher"? - It's a nice name. What's yours? - Pelin Taşkıran. Pelin Taşkıran! I can't find anything in this kitchen. Where are the cups? Here they are. - What's the last thing you can remember? - Eh... We were in the restaurant kitchen wanting to leave. Two years ago. What about you? I was in the kitchen, I was cooking. Two years ago. Who are you? What do you do? Why would I have married you? And who are you? Why would I have married you? I didn't mean it like that. I didn't use that tone. Whatever. And by the way, until we get to the bottom of this, you stay away from me. So far away that a taxi would cost 200 lira. Got it? This time I do use that tone: Why would I have married you? Did a rock fall on my head? - Did you put a spell on me? - Now you listen! First, I get a heart attack when I even hear the word "marriage". Second, I'm not one of those girls who gives her number to every guy right away. Think twice before speculating about me. "Why would I have married you?" sounds dumb regardless of the tone you use, and that's three. I'll just say one thing. You can only have me in your dreams. No, you can only have me in your dreams! Merve, I'll be late! Make something up. Say... - To whom? - Say there was an accident on the bridge! - Where are you going? - I'm not losing my job because of you! - Let's get a divorce. - An immediate divorce. Ms Pelin, I washed your car. - My car? - Yes, your car. I have a car? - Where is my car? - What? My car. Where is it? What's that? A bike. Are you kidding me? No. This is a nightmare! It has to be done by Friday. Merve, did you tell the boss about the accident? She'll probably fire me this time. Ms Pelin, would you like some coffee? Why so formal? What coffee? Merve! What's wrong? I'm showing respect in front of the staff. Boss, I'm sorry I arrived late, but... But that's my desk! Why is someone else sitting there? Ms Pelin, I'll bring coffee to your office at once. My office? Please come with me. I think you're still half-asleep. What's up with you this morning? Merve, is this my office? Yes. Mr Engin? Nice to see you. - Likewise. What am I doing today? - I don't know. What are you doing here? - I just asked you that. - Well, that's up to you. - How come? Aren't you my assistant? - Not anymore, Mr Engin. I'm going mad. You don't look too great. You look tired. Have a seat. I'll bring water. I'm not doing great at all. I'll go rest in my office. Mr Engin. Just a moment. Wait! - You don't have an office here! - What's that supposed to mean? - You sold the company. - What? How did I become the boss? Honey, Engin invested. Great guy! You took over the company. What's up with you? Are you okay? I am now! Here you are. Hey? Are you happy with your new job? If you think it appropriate, how can I not be pleased? And how did you feel? When I took over the company? I was happy, very happy. Very happy, huh? You can go. Why would I sell it? - The boss doesn't wish to be disturbed. - Who is this boss? You? Er... What? My best friend stole my company? I'll call back. - I did what? Steal your company? - Yes! You stole it! What are you talking about? Are you okay? Darling? Eda, honey. I'm going crazy. Tell me what's going on. Tell you what? Eda, did you get married? Engin, stop it please. I really don't remember anything. Why? When? Who did you marry? My beloved Cihan. Wasn't the company enough for you? You stole my girlfriend too? You bastard. Engin, enough of this! You said you fell in love. "I'm changing my life. I'm quitting this. I'm not tearing any more buildings down, the neighbourhoods are full of memories. To hell with progress and change!" Pelin totally changed you. Have you forgotten? It's because of the accident. - What accident? - The accident with the car. Those were your choices. Did I tell you to open a restaurant? What did I open? You opened a restaurant. Is everything ready? The truffles? The soup? Yes, it's all ready. There's the boss. I'll serve the soup. Hey, boss! Where have you been? Emre... - Is this restaurant mine? - Isn't it beautiful? Let me tell you something. It was right to sell the firm to open here. - I opened it, didn't I? - Are you alright? No, I'm not. What I've been through since this morning, anyone would go crazy. - Did you argue with Pelin? - Who is Pelin? Your wife. Ah, Pelin. Thanks for the reminder. You're really not doing well. You're pale. Come. Sit down, I'll bring a glass of water. The doctor said the accident would have consequences. What accident? Here are the truffles you ordered from Italy for the party tonight! Did I order these? Tonight's creamy portobello mushroom soup with smoked garlic is ready. - Let me try it. - There you are. Creamy, infused with garlic. Some truffle. Right... Great. Pelin will love it. Pelin, yes. Guys, I have to go. Good luck. Your career star is shining, honey, you can rest at ease. Nice, nice. Pelin! There's fabulous news. Something small is coming, a baby, a baby. A baby? What baby? There's no baby. There, no baby. Pelin, why did you wipe it off? Don't you two want a baby? You started practicing with Engin, right? Practicing? Yeah, practicing. You know what I mean. Like a pendulum, back and forth. I get it, I get it. I understand, Merve. I feel sick. Morning sickness! I'm going to be an aunt. Yes, an aunt! I'm not pregnant. You're not going to be an aunt. I'm not pregnant. Stop. The new suppliers are here. Show them to the conference room. I'll be right there. Let's talk about it later. Something's up with you, I can tell. How am I meant to explain this to Merve? "I woke up this morning, and next to me was this guy out of a surprise egg!" Speak of the devil. - Yes? -We urgently need to talk. - What's so urgent then? - It's not an emergency. I exaggerated. - My life's ruined, that's all. - Oh really! That's interesting. Glad it didn't happen to me. So let's discuss your urgent issue. Pelin, turns out, I traded my car for a bicycle. My construction company, a top one in the country. I handed over to my friend, and I opened a restaurant! All this since I met you! Why? It must be your fault! You're right. What happened to you is worse. But I'm sure I didn't force you into anything. Such a quiet tone all of a sudden? You know, actually I ought to thank you about the company where I was working... for buying it. What? What company? We organize weddings. What? I sell a multi-million-dollar company to do what? Keep kids off the dancefloor? Ask the groom for a tip? - It's not like that. - This isn't right. We have to wake up. We should get professional help. - Immediately! - Where? I know a specialist. - As if I don't want to wake up. - Please come. You've been married for two years and don't know each other. You're both in the same dream and can't wake up from it? - Everyone around us thinks it's normal. - It's not a dream, it's a nightmare. - I want my life back. - Me too. Well, two people being in the same dream at the same time is scientifically not tenable. It's also not tenable that I sold my company and my car. - And then this... - Speak freely. As if I weren't here. I was going to say this marriage. I quite agree with the blockhead beside me on that matter. We cannot be married. "Blockhead"? What the hell? - Insults aren't helpful. - You started it, with your "this". I didn't mean it like that. Doesn't matter! What you mean is as meaningless as you! - Enough! - What? Doctor, I've stayed away from hysterical, nagging women all my life. - What's with the nagging? - You're the one doing that! Quiet! Be quiet! - He started it! - She started it! Please calm down. In psychology, what you're doing is called projection. You suppress your inner fears, and project your anger onto the other. - Let's get back to your problem. - Yes, please. We see this often in recently-married couples. The fear of losing one's individuality in married life. You're traumatized. Worrying if you made the right call affected your memory. That's not the point. I don't know this woman. Don't know me? I don't know you at all. Then get to know each other! You only get a chance like this in a dream. Fall in love again. Everyone wants that. Fall in love? With a stranger? Well, you are married. You fell in love once. You can again. Relive the moments you were first drawn to each other. Doctor, we can't remember them. Then create new moments, new memories. Hold hands, go for romantic dinners, on holiday... Discover each other, surprise each other! Have no fear of being together. As soon as you decide that you want to be together, this so-called nightmare will end. We want to wake up, get couples therapy instead. You suggested it. Clearly you've benefitted from it before. - I want out of this nightmare. - Me too. You got any ideas? - No. - I have one. We'll read my diary. - You keep a diary? - Go on, laugh. It's all in there. - Fine. If that's what it takes. - Watch out! What a lunatic. Are you okay? It's a blind corner here. Didn't see him. I'm okay. Stop it! - Cinema... You held my hand here. - Here? What are you doing? You think it's that simple? You didn't grab it right away. First you casually stretched and then slowly lowered your hand and took mine in your palm. No, I've never behaved like that. Are these your fantasies? I've never held hands like that. I'm not the type. - I see. So you've done it a lot? - Sure. And not just holding hands. - So what did you do? - Do you want to know? Look! Dream or not, hold any hand but mine, and I'll poke your eyes out. - Keep your voice down! - We're trying to watch the movie! Enough is enough! Holding hands didn't work out. It's not working. Let's give up. No. I learned my lesson. I'll play by the book now. What comes next? First dance, by the sea, at sunset. We're so romantic. Come. Are you always in such a rush? The first dance was by the sea. We're by the sea. Right. Shame on you. In front of everyone. This is a public place. Go home and play. Oh, but bleating in public is allowed? - And dancing is forbidden? Excuse me? - What did you say? Buddy, get your wife under control, or... - Or what? - Or we'll teach her a lesson. Here's your lesson, you fool. What are you doing? What's next? - That's enough for today. - But we have to wake up. Let's keep going. What's next? Our first kiss. Ah! And where? I was showing you the neighbourhood I grew up in. It happened there. Let's go. Hopefully there will be no mishaps. Come on. I don't believe it! What happened to my neighbourhood? - Why was everything destroyed? - No progress without change. Progress? This is progress? Where is the street we ran down as kids? The store that sold chewing gum? The bakery with sweet pastries, the orchard, the park for playing ball? All those bittersweet memories got bulldozed. And you call these changes progress? Yes, because... some of these buildings are mine. Well, they were until I sold the company. The neighbourhood I spent my childhood in. You tore it down? It's my job. No. It won't work with us. We don't suit each other. - I want a divorce! - Calm down. I quit the company. - Apparently you convinced me. - Good thing! What kind of a job is that? - I'm going. - You're not going anywhere. What are you going to do? Force me? Let's go home. To our home? I have nowhere else. Neither do I. Let's go. - Have you calmed down a bit? - No. I just want this day to be over. Did you hear that? No. But let's take a look. Happy anniversary! Welcome to hell. Let's get this over with. - Mum! - Happy anniversary! Son-in-law! I haven't seen you in ages. Congratulations. How are you, my girl? Taken by surprise, huh? You can say that again. My darling. I admit that it was the boss's plan. We've spent almost a week preparing. We even ordered truffles from Italy. It's the same menu as your first dinner together. See if you like it. Delicious. Really excellent. Thank you so much. Finally we check something off our list. Do you feel any different? Nope. What in heaven's name are you whispering about? Bring bowls so we can serve. The soup's getting cold. Go on, my child. Where are the plates again? - So you planned the party? - Yes, it looks like it. Where are your parents? I'm... not talking to my father. I mean, he won't speak to me. My mother died. My condolences. Thanks. Why don't you talk to him? Long story. Darling, come over to us. Say, have you lost weight again? Are you still on a diet? Listen, women with wide hips bear strapping sons. Isn't it about time? What are you talking about? Dear Engin, when will I hold our grandchild in my arms? When are we going to become grandparents? - Isn't that a little too soon? - Soon? Life passes in a flash! Your wedding feels like it was yesterday. How long has it been? Yes, what a day. Your dress was straight out of a picture book. So glamorous. I was enchanted when I saw it. And when he proposed? Yes. That had a certain... - What did it have? - How do you mean? You've never talked about it, you keep it a secret. We're just curious. How did you propose to her? Engin, tell us. Please! There isn't much to tell. - It was a normal proposal. - Right. "Normal" is relative. Some are more enthusiastic. Your story is different from the others. Wasn't there also a poem? Engin wrote one for you, one that even rhymed. His proposal to you was full of passionate verses. Yes, his poem. Did you write it yourself? Of course. You can't propose with someone else's poem. My son-in-law can even write poems! Ah, my lovely boy. I'm sure you can still remember your own poem. Go on, please recite it. We're curious. Well, as it's quite intimate, I have to ask my dear wife's permission first. If she agrees... We're not strangers! Or are you ashamed in front of us? No, why would I be? Recite it! So it's okay. Alright. Go on, my boy. Pelin, this is your day Oh, sweet! You'll be my bride, okay? Thanks to you, I found the right way I gave up my home, and my job, yay! It's probably for the best, though You love me as much as I love you, I know Great, way to go! Bravo, son-in-law. Don't be so hard on the boy. He doesn't want to recite the actual poem as it's private. - Good job, son-in-law. - Thank you. I'll get that. Son, it's nothing bad. Is it? It really isn't, right, Dad? You say you miss me and have me stand at the door? Are you crazy? - Ah, something's bothering you. - Dad. I've missed you so much. Son, this woman is your big break. Don't dare do anything stupid and scare her off. This time I wouldn't forgive you as long as I live. How so? Son, Pelin saved your life after the accident. Sometimes I still get... lapses of memory. What did she do? You were in a coma for weeks. When the doctors gave up on you... she said you could hear her. She said she saw tears in your eyes. Night after night, she sat by your side. She talked to you, cooked and brought your favourite food. The smell of the food woke you from your coma. Engin? Engin? Engin, are you conscious? Nurse! Pelin literally brought you back to life. Don't you remember any of that? You should get checked out again. I do, I remember... most of it. The doctor said it might happen. I'll go help Pelin. We could have cleared everything up tomorrow. It's okay. All done. Give me that. I'll do it. Then I'll load this one. Thanks. What for? For reconciling me with my father. Thank you too. I've never seen my father so happy. He kept on saying "my son-in-law". Why weren't you two speaking? My mother had cancer. It was discovered late. There was nothing they could do. I'd just graduated and was working like crazy on my start-up. I wanted her to see how successful I was before she went. I wanted her to be proud of me. Or I was afraid. I couldn't bear to see her wasting away day by day. I buried myself in work. Then came the news. I was away at a conference. I missed the funeral. My father deleted me from his life. I thought he'd never forgive me. I'll make up a bed for your father. - There you go. - Thanks for taking the trouble. It's no trouble at all. Well, good night then. Pelin? A present for your anniversary. I want you to have it. - That's really not necessary. - Please. - It's incredibly beautiful. - It was my late wife's. She inherited it from her mother. Thank you very much. I owe my thanks to you. You brought my useless son back to life and made a man of him. Many thanks. Good night. - Oh, spread out in the empty bed. - Yes, so what? - We're not sharing the bed. - But we woke up here? I'm not making that mistake again. My father is downstairs, so the living room is out. Yes, that doesn't work. Too scandalous. It would be nice if you took after him more. He's extremely courteous and very cultivated. I wish you were more like your mother. Although she is desperate for a grandchild. I can't think of anything scarier. Yes, total nightmare. Right, get up. Come on, come on. - What's the plan? - Get up! Here's what we'll do. The cover goes on the floor. - You can sleep on that, okay? - Why do I get the floor? You sleep there if you won't share. The bed's huge. What are you scared of? Should I be scared of something? Okay, then lend a hand. We'll put it back. Help me. But there must be at least three pillow lengths between us, okay? I can't believe I married a woman who wants pillows between us in bed. - Now what are you doing? - I'm getting changed. In my presence? Huh? You have no inhibition at all. Look away if you're embarrassed. Go on then. - Go on? - Get changed. No, I'll sleep in my clothes. Don't be scared, you can be sure that I won't touch you. But... if you can't resist, sleep in your clothes. All you ever say is nonsense. That I can't resist, I'm scared. What of? Turn off the light and let's go to sleep. I want this day to end. My hair has started going grey. In one night! Overnight! This marriage is turning me into a wreck. I hurt all over. Good morning to you too by the way. Pelin? What's that? What's that? - What did you do to me, Engin? - I never even touched you! - So how did this happen if you didn't? - Calm down. I'm sure there's a rational explanation. - Rational? - Don't cry. We'll find a solution. Hands off! Hands off! I said at least three pillow lengths. I told you that. You and your pillows. - Even if last night... - Aha! Tell me what you did last night! You must have done it then. Admit it! You can't have become nine months pregnant in one night. It's happened again. It's happened again. No. No, I can't. I can't become a mother. I'm not ready to become a father either. You should have thought of that beforehand. The worst thing about it is I never touched you. If you had done, would it be crawling with kids here? Let's go to the therapist. Okay. Plums! - Plums? - Yes. Juicy, green plums. At this time of year? You wake up one morning as a married couple. Next morning you wake up, Pelin is pregnant. You don't know how it happened. You're in a dream. - Yes. - I see. First of all, two people being in the same dream... - is not scientifically tenable. - You've told us that. You told us to repeat the first, key moments of our relationship, to connect with other again. Then the nightmare would end. And did you try that? - We attempted to. - But a lot went wrong. - We weren't very successful. - No, your success is visible. Keep trying. I'm glad we came to you. It's been productive for us. Helpful. Are there any other options? A pill or something? You're going through a recurring trauma. Two years ago, you were afraid of your relationship. Now you don't feel ready to become mother and father. The moment you overcome your fear, the dream, or nightmare, will end. But what about this? If you are dreaming, as you claim, you need a traumatic event to wake up. Birth is just such an event. One wakes from a dream just before what one fears takes place. So you don't need to worry. Look out! I forgot about this place. What a fright! Thank you. Look at me. If I swim in the Aegean, two countries will argue over a new island. Engin, after all those sour plums, I need some sweet nibbles. Someone has to stop me. I want something sweet! Excuse me? - Do you have desserts? - Unfortunately not. - We have tea, coffee... - What? Nothing sweet at all? Then I'll have to munch these sugar cubes. - I'll get something from the kiosk. - Thanks. - Thanks. - You're welcome. So, shall we continue? I'll wake up anyway just before giving birth. What if I don't wake up? We have to continue. We must. We need traumatic events. How about you proposing to me? - It was so romantic. - What did I do? No way! As if I would want that. Drop it. Let's see... - Asking for my parents' blessing? - No way. Oh, yes! - There's nothing more traumatic. - How do we do it? How's it done? I prepare it all at my mother's, you get flowers and chocolate. You bring your father and come to ours. I'd understand renewing your wedding vows, but asking for our blessing again is crazy. It's for Pelin. She's going nuts at home. And it's also the doctor's advice. - What's wrong with her? - Is it serious? No, it's to boost her morale. The doctor says it must be just like that day. Can I ask that we let Pelin experience it again? Engin's mouth will be on fire in a minute. These chillies are very hot. Put some salt in too. My rabbit wants some. Your rabbit wants some? He can't. The coffee will burn his mouth. She's so big. She's grown so much. What's all this for? Look at me. You now what? We'll talk about it later. Let's take the coffee and not keep them waiting. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Enjoy it. - Slowly, slowly. - Thanks, Dad. Well? How does it taste? So, these two young people have met and fallen in love. No, no. You were very nervous that day. So I told a joke to lighten up the atmosphere. Of course! Please go ahead. Good. So, it went like this. Temel walks down the road one day and sees a banana peel on the ground. What do you think he says? "Oh dear! I'm sure to fall. Again!" I mean... You know, Temel... Cengiz. No one laughed that day. Go on, Yusuf. - Dear in-laws, my son saw your daughter... - Rabbit! - What is it? Pelin? - Mum! What's wrong? It's coming! Breathe! - It's coming - What's coming? It is, what else? Dad, hurry. - By God's will and the... - You have my blessing! - Congratulations. Now hurry. - Come, quickly my child. Come. It's not far now. It's okay. Nearly there. - It's coming. It really is! - Hang on, honey. Hang on, we're nearly there! Breathe, breathe. Hurry, Engin! - Doctor! A stretcher! - Help! My wife is having a baby. Engin, hold my hand. - Engin! - My love? - We'll wake up, won't we? - Yes! You wait here. How are you? I'm fine. And you? A bit confused. How is our mother? - Fine. I'm just a bit tired. - So is the little lady. It's time you all got some rest. There. Slowly. Pelin. - You know what... - I know. I'm glad we didn't wake up. Yes, luckily we didn't. - We need a name. - Yes. I always thought if I had a daughter, I'd call her Zeynep. Well, I find that a bit boring. Let's choose a different one. Boring? As boring as "Engin"? My daughter, boring? - She's mine too! - She was in my belly for nine months. Nine months? One night! - One night? - It happened overnight. Our mother should rest now. Yes. It's happened again. Engin, it's happened again! My daughter! Where is my daughter? - Engin, nothing bad has happened, right? - Calm down, I'm sure nothing happened. It's like being in prison, this. How lovely. Like an angel. She looks like you. She has your nose. What did we call her? I think I called her Zeynep. I doubt if I let you do that. Zeynep? My daughter. My daughter. Daddy. She said Daddy. Did you hear? - Not so loud, you'll scare her. - Mummy. She called me Mummy! I can't believe it. You called me Mummy! - I'm your Mummy. Who is your Mummy? - Rabbit. - She said rabbit! - She said rabbit. Rabbit! Rabbit. - Rabbit. - Rabbit. You are our little rabbit. Rabbit. Was there a rabbit in our dream? Go and find one. - Shall I go and get a rabbit? - That sounds good. Come to Mummy. Rabbit... No rabbit here. - Hello. Can I help you? - Hello. Do you have stuffed rabbits? - I'm not sure, I'll have a look. - Great. There's only this defect one. You can have it half-price if you want. I'll take it. Swing, swing, swing you back Rabbit! Yes, a rabbit. Daddy found a rabbit for us. What a nice daddy. - They only had this. I bought him anyway. - Well done. Yes, you grab him. What are we going to do? I wish I knew. We can't go on like this. Or in a few days we'll be old and we'll die. We have to stop it. Any idea how? Let's live this one day. You, me and our daughter. Like a real family. I agree. That was the best day of my life. - To today. - To today. Regardless of whether this is real or a dream, whatever happens, I'll never let you go. It's the most beautiful dream I've ever had. What will we wake up to? I don't know. Merve! Merve? - What's up, Pelin? - Get up! Pelin, don't scare me. What's up? I've fallen in love. Merve, I've fallen in love. Okay, okay, okay, my love. How did that happen? In a dream. Man! It was only a dream, and now I'm awake again. You know, baby, I left you. For a two-wheel lump of aluminium with 18 gears. "Istanbul Playboy Engin Taşkıran was caught leaving a club with two girls. What will his long-standing girlfriend Eda Sever have to say about it?" - Him? Are you sure? - Yes, him. - Him, seriously? - Yes, I told you. What more do you want? - Well I find him a bit... - A bit what? Don't get me wrong, but we rarely meet his type in our lives. It's like with a bag of crisps. We usually get the crumbs at the bottom. - It only happens in fairy tales. - Or in dreams, you'll say. You're right. - I didn't mean that. - Fine, it was just a silly dream. The dream ended. The guy leads a life that would make Casanova jealous. What would I say? "Hello, Mr Engin, I dreamed of you. We were happily married and had a child." Who would believe that? I'm a mathematician and I'd like a funny line. "You're the loveliest prime number." How's that? It should be more romantic. "I'm flying with my angel to cloud nine," for example? Is it so important? - Do you love each other? - Yes. Then the line doesn't matter. Since when are weddings competitive? "I have the funniest line." "I'm the best groom." "I'm the cutest bride." You know what's really important? You two. What you feel when you look at each other. Weddings used to take place in neighbourhood tea gardens. Those weddings in the neighbourhood were more genuine, intimate and beautiful. - Believe me, I've seen them. - Pelin, can we have a word? You decide. We'll prepare your desired wording at once. Come. Do you want to scare our clients off? - I said keep your ideas to yourself! - Okay, enough! I quit! Seriously! Pelin! Pelin, what are you doing? I've had enough. I'm not working here anymore. I quit. Okay, I get it. I wanted to say, the universe is obviously trying to tell you something. If you want to change your life, don't stop. Keep going. What do you have to lose? - Please clear my desk. - Sure. Ms Eda wants to remind you about the couples therapy tonight. - The Fikirtepe building... - Is not getting demolished. Excuse me? Where are the streets that people ran down as kids? The chewing gum stores? The baker with sweet pastries, the park to play ball? The orchards. We bulldozed those memories. The least we can do is not take their homes. Are you serious? Absolutely. As you wish. I'll continue then... - The project in Bomonti... - Does your list include anything like "dance at sunset by the sea?" I don't quite understand. "Make it up with your father. Only do work that you like." Does it? "Today you will fall in love." Is that on the list? - No, Mr Engin. - No. - Please cancel everything. - But what shall I tell everyone? That I have awoken from my dream. - Please send Cihan in to see me. - Very well. You're transferring the company to me because you had a dream? It wasn't a dream. You're sacrificing everything for a woman? You? Who is this woman? I'm curious. She's called Pelin. What is it? Why have you come? Dad, we need to talk. So you're not weighed down with work? Like you were when you couldn't even come to your mother's funeral. People deal with pain differently. I buried myself in work. As soon as I even paused for a moment, my thoughts were with her. I couldn't bear seeing her like that. I ran away. Remember when I was little? Whenever I fell, you walked away. So I learned how to get up. I was just like you, Dad. But I've changed. I know this will mean nothing to you, you won't believe me. No, you've changed. You wouldn't have said this before. Just like me. What has changed you? A woman. Then you should hold on to this woman. What's her name? Pelin. We were married. What? When did you get married? - Long story. - We've got time. And raki. So tell me. Yesterday I had a dream. It was all so real. Whatever you have to do, find her. I will. Come here. Keep driving please. Yes? - Have fun. - Thanks. Great. I'll take it. - Good luck, Mr Engin. - Thank you very much. - Hello. - Hello. - Do you have stuffed rabbits? - Just a defect one, I'll get it. I'll take it. Yes? Something wrong? No, I was just lost in thought. It's nothing. Hey buddy, turn that down. - This is a public place. - Can you two swim? Have you got a problem? What's up? Yes, I have a problem. Good grief. Are there any people here who are normal? - Eda? -Engin. Don't forget our therapy is at seven. I think it will do our relationship good. -You are coming, aren't you? - I'm coming. Coming here to take your relationship to the next level is a brave step. I'm leaving you, Eda. - Excuse me? - I've fallen in love with another woman. - In what? - I saw her in a dream. This is credit to you. I came to thank you. Credit to me? What did I do? - You helped me to wake up. - How? I don't believe this! We come here and talk about a woman from your dream? Eda, I'm sorry. You'll be much happier with someone else. I'm speechless, Engin! I've fallen in love, Eda. Forgive me. - I don't believe this! - Eda! Eda, wait. Eda! You'll be much happier. I'll make you pay for this. Pelin! Engin? Engin! Engin, Engin, Engin! Engin, Engin, wake up! I won't leave you. I promise. - I know. - Please don't exert yourself. We'll get to the hospital soon. You'll recover, Engin. I'm here with you. May it stay that way. It will stay this way. We have our whole life ahead of us. Our story has just begun. Pelin and Engin. On this life path you have taken to write your own story, I wish you good luck. My dear daughter-in-law brought my son back to life. Dear Pelin, welcome to our family. - I'd like to tell you all a joke. - No, no. Sit down, my dear. -So, how did you two meet? -Us? In a dream.
