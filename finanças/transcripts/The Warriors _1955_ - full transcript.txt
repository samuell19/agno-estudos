[instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [dramatic music] [music continues] Stand to. St. George here. [music continues] We're ready, My Lords. Follow me, all of you. - Bring out the others. - Yes, sire. Bernard. [music continues] They're here. My Lords and Knights the most noble and powerful lord, Edward III King of England and France. On your knees, sirs. You may rise. Are there no more French noblemen, Sir Philip? A few more, sire, all badly wounded. The rest are dead. Or escaped. My Lords, this is a truce between England and France to which we have already put our hand. It will be ratified in London by your former king who is now our prisoner. The fighting is over between us. Is that a truce, sir, or a surrender? What is your name? I am Count Robert De Ville. Perhaps, you would like to read the terms of the truce, My Lord. They include an amnesty of yourself and for the other French knights, now our prisoners. In exchange for what? In exchange for your word as men of honor that you will lay down your arms and make no further attempt to seize from us what is our just heritage. I do not agree to such terms. I recognize no English overlord. My lands belong to me and I will defend my right to them. You are mistaken, My Lord. We hold absolute sovereignty over all Aquitaine. However, your states are not forfeit. Not yet. Not for so long as you live on them in peace and obey our laws. 'You are free to go.' I have given no promise...sir. We are no longer enemies, My Lord. But I would advice you to remember that you are our subjects. And while this truce is in effect any act of rebellion on your part will be dealt with... as treason. Leave us. - It seems to me, My Liege... - What am I to do, Philip? Execute every French noble who refuses to accept me as his overlord? [scoffs] It scares to do that. Nor can I imprison them indefinitely for bearing arms against us in honorable battle. [sighs] I don't know. Hm. But they're not all as dangerous as De Ville. He is a determined fighter, My Liege. I know. I broke a lance against him. And yet, I couldn't unhorse him. You fought valiantly, my young friend. Thank you, My Liege. Is there any word of my son? Well, not since nightfall, sir. The last I saw of the prince, he and Sir John were leading the attack against the French, right flank. [laughs] They chased them for miles. They'll be ours before they come back. - 'Stand to.' - Take a fresh horse, Philip a.. [instrumental music] Edward! Yes, father. [chuckles] Sir John, did you and Edward chase the French all the way to the sea? [laughs] No, sire. We stayed with Sir Philip's brother, Sir James.. ...until he died. I'm sorry, boy. When you have your armor off, I want to talk to you. [sighs] No man could be prouder of his son than I am of you, Edward. You've done great honor to me. - And to England. - Thank you, sire. Prepare some food for us. What's troubling you? Come, tell me. Victory. The victory was ours today. But many good men died French as well as English. Yes. Yes, Edward. You've convinced me that I have made the right decision. What decision? I must return to England with the army. Return? There are difficulties at home. But, father, if we withdraw now we forfeit everything we've been fighting for. I said I must return to England. You will remain in France. With such men as I can safely spare. I look to you to keep the peace in Aquitaine. And to govern it with wisdom.. ...and courage and compassion. Ruler of Aquitaine? Duke of Aquitaine. This is English soil, Edward. As English as that upon which Westminster Abbey stands. For almost two centuries, it has been our heritage and our responsibility. We cannot shake it. Some of the French nobles are still rebellious. They'll make trouble if they can but they are weak and scattered. Before they can reorganize their armies in sufficient strength I hope to be able to send you adequate reinforcements. - Until then.. - Father. I'll hold Aquitaine for you. I know you will. To England and St. George. To England and St. George. France and St. Denis (all) France and St. Denis. [instrumental music] They are fine words, My Lords of France. I heard you shout them yesterday in ringing tones as we arm for battle today, they should die in your throats. I never thought it'd cost you so little to bow to an English king. It cost us a great deal. Who are you to taunt us in our defeat? Well, now, I'm the only one it seems that'll not admit defeat. Captives at the foot of a conqueror have no choice but to admit it. You have tongues, you could have refused his terms. Refuse them? When King John had agreed to them? We have only the word of the English king. King John is a prisoner. Who knows under what jurors he was when he said he'll cede to that treaty. These are infamous terms. I, for one, will not be parted to them. You speak boldly, De Ville. But our army's been routed. We haven't the strength to break the truce. Very well, let us appear to keep it until we are strong enough to break it. That day may never come. How can we rebuild an army when we have no leader? King John is dead to us. - The Dauphin rules France. - The Dauphin, hah! And who rules the Dauphin? Du Guesclin. Du Guesclin? What assurance has he given that he'll continue the fight? None. Not yet. But, My Lord, unless we know... Now, hear me. Du Guesclin can be persuaded to declare himself Lord High Constable. That much I know. With him as our leader, nothing will stop us driving the English out of France. Nothing, that is except.. ...cowardice. Now, who will pledge himself with me to defend his land and his rights? Who will say as I do? We continue the war in our own way. I do. - I do. - And I. [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] Good. - Good. - Very good. Uh, here, John, your turn. My Lord, I haven't handled one of these things for 15 years. Only 15? Well, show us how good you used to be. - Here. - Very well. Now, I can hardly see that shield, much less hit it. Well, try shutting your eyes. [laughing] Um, if we have to defend this castle I'll do much better with a sword. Swords are all very well, John. Swords or Javelin. But for me.. [applause] (male #1) 'My Lords, My Lords!' Foot soldiers approaching, from the East. [dramatic music] They're not soldiers. (Sir John) 'Well, whoever they are' 'they are too many for us to meet unarmed.' - Hurl them a sword and knight... - Wait. This is no attack. They are not even armed. Lower the drawbridge. Lower the drawbridge! [instrumental music] What's your business? [music continues] - Sir John. - My Lord. Remove them. I am Gurd, My Lord, from the forest of Chatel. We come with the hope of speaking to the English ruler. I'm your ruler. I am Edward, Prince of Wales. - Your servant, My Liege. - Well, rise, Gurd. 'Say what you have to say.' We, we come to speak for the peasants, My Lord. None of us want anything more than to live out our lives in peace. Every man has a right to that. Thank you, sire. But our lords tell us this cannot be. Who are these lords? The-the nobles, on whose land we live and work. They say we are still at war. They force us to give two hours of everyday to practice of arms. Yes, with spears and with swords. Now we have to pay more taxes. And if we've got no money for the taxes they take our cows and our chickens. Or our daughters. Hm. These nobles, what are their names? Their leader is my master, Count Robert De Ville. Robert De Ville? Any of you know this man? I've heard of him. The biggest land owner in all Aquitaine. I know him, My Lord, one of the nobles released by King Edward under the truce. The one who would not swear to keep the peace. Hmm. Go back and tell your friends this. 'Have no more fear of these injustices.' 'There will be no more enforced practice at arms.' Nor any illegal taxes. Today, a proclamation to this effect will be made. [all cheering] [instrumental music] This will be read and posted in every village without delay. Yes, My Lord. [music continues] - Who is there? - Open your eyes, fellow. It's the banner of the Young Earl of Kent. And this is his sister, the Lady Joan Holland. - 'Lower the bridge!' - That moat looks so pretty. Look, John. - Are there any fishes in it? - Of course there are. Big ones with very sharp teeth. - How do you know? - Because I do. And do you know what they like to eat best? - No. - Little boys like you. - They do not. - That's enough, My Lord. Lady Joan, welcome. Welcome in the name of my master. - The Duke of Aquitaine. - Thank you, Philip. Don't kneel to me. Help me down. How amazing and wonderful to see you here in this forlorn place. I'd almost forgotten how beautiful English women are. [laughs] And I'd almost forgotten what a charming flatterer you are. - Take me to the prince. - Ha-ha, into the courtyard. [instrumental music] (Philip) 'Forgive me for disturbing you, My Lord.' But I thought you wouldn't mind. Joan? Can it be? Yes, My Lord. I'm Edward to you. I always have been. That was a long time ago, when I was a little girl. Oh, a little girl, and now I suppose you're a dear little white head veil. Joan, just to see you again.. Tell me, what are you doing here in France? I'm taking my brothers to their new home. - New home? - Yes. The house and lands my husband left me. Just beyond the river. Ah.. Hm. I think it'd be wiser if you stayed here at the castle. Oh, thank you. But it was my husband's wish that my brothers and I should go there to live. And why shouldn't we? Now that the war is over. We believe it's over. There are a number of French nobles who are still rebellious. I'd be much happier if you stayed here. We all would. I very much doubt, My Lord, if the French nobles would harm a widow and two small children. That's out of the question. It's very kind of you to worry about me, My Lord but I wish to live in my own home. That is, unless you forbid me to do so. Joan, you and your brothers are English subjects and therefore, our responsibility. Besides, I haven't the men here to spare from the castle to protect your home. Have I asked for soldiers, My Lord? I've been a widow for three years now. I'm perfectly capable of looking after my own household. Hm. In London perhaps, where you should have stayed. I would have done so, My Lord if I'd known I'd be unwelcome here. "Unwelcome?" Oh, Joan, you haven't changed since you were ten years old. Haven't I, My Lord? [laughs] Very well. As you wish. I'll not detain you. Thank you. I hope you will be able to visit us soon. I shall be pleased to. But I still believe you're taking a grave risk. My home will be honored to receive Edward, Prince of Wales. "No practice of arms. No military taxes." You say that this proclamation is posted in every village, D'Estell? Yes, My Lord. Libeau, it seems our English overlord has made the first move. And a bold one. By directly countermanding your orders Edward challenges your authority and asserts his own. But you're not so easily overruled. Eh, My Lord? If only we knew his real strength now that the English king has returned home. I warrant, he's scarcely half the army left. How can he enforce orders like these? We should go round the villages and tear them all down. Open treason. Not very clever, D'Estell. Besides, it serves no purpose. This order has the support of the peasants. We must woo them, not antagonize them. Since when do I, the Count of Aquitaine have to woo woodcutters? Since the Duke of Aquitaine began receiving them in audience. (D'Estell) 'Yes. No one is turned away.' They swarm to his castle like lepers to a shrine. They grovel and groan. And he pours forth promises as freely as a confessor giving absolution. He'll make loyal English subjects of them all. - Unless we can get rid of him. - Hah. Admittedly. - But how is it to be done? - I shall find a way. And what knows that those soft vitals of yours that you yield so easily? Only a milk shop throws down the glove at the first joust. D'Estell, you say Edward denies no one his presence, huh? He admits the lowliest. The very scum of Aquitaine. Provided they come unarmed, cap in hand. Fawning of speech and manner. [hammering] There's another group of peasants outside, My Lord. - Is there no end to them? - Shall I bring them in? Bring them in. Welcome, my friends. You may rise. What is it? Speak. If you have grievances, speak. We have grievances. Death to the English! [intense music] [screams] [swords clanking] [groans] [screams] [music continues] [grunts] [groans] [screams] [music continues] - Who are you? - Where are you from? Answer or I'll tear you apart. Aah. I am Francois Le Clerc from Poitiers. Who sent you? Count Robert De Ville. De Ville. Again. Where could they be? They should have been back hours ago. Do you think we sent enough men? If we sent any more, it would be suspicious. They should have been enough. They must have bungled. Cunning will avail us nothing. We must wait until we can build up an army. Do we need an army to kill one man? I tell you, Libeau, if we can rid ourselves of this Edward, Prince of Wales we can break the English hold on Aquitaine. The gall of these English. They're so confident of their position here that they are bringing their women folk to live in the chateaus they have stolen from us. - Ha-ha. Their women folk? - A friend of Prince Edward's. Setting up house with her brothers in the Villa d'Aville. - Almost under our noses. - Why not? According to the truce, they're our fellow countrymen. [laughs] You would have us play good neighbors. - Eh, Libeau? - Who is she? A young widow of Sir Thomas Holland. As the chief land owner of Aquitaine you should pay her a courtesy call. A courtesy call? By St. Denis, how can you talk of such foolery? - Are we not at war? - Just a minute, D'Estell. I think Libeau is right. Perhaps I should pay her a call. Perhaps we all should. [horses galloping] [instrumental music] - You're sure that's the house? - 'Yes, My Lord.' 'She's been there several weeks now with her brothers' 'and the mistress, Genevieve, who looks after the children.' Very well. I want them all unharmed. - Libeau and I will stay here. - Very well, My Lord. Follow me. Come on. Come on. I still think this is dangerous, My Lord. When Prince Edward hears of it, he'll attack us. And we are not yet strong enough to resist him. I think we are. And the only way to find out is to draw him out of his castle. Do you realize, this is a deliberate violation of the treaty King John has signed? Our brave sovereign is a captive of the English in London. Why should we be abound by the signature of a cringing prisoner? Don't dare lay your hands on me! - Where are you taking me? - We have our orders. Who gives orders in Aquitaine except Prince Edward? Let me go! Put me down! 'You put me down!' [music continues] My Lord, Lady Joan and her brothers have been taken by De Ville. - What? - Yes, My Lord. I was watching from the woods. - Were they harmed? - No, sire. The servant was killed, but the ladies and the children were just taken away. I want every lance to ride at once. Yes, My Lord. Philip, ready your bowmen. (Philip) 'My Lord.' Arm yourself. [instrumental music] [music continues] Open the gate! It's Dubois, call the guard. [horse galloping] - What is it, Dubois? - The English, My Lord. - They're attacking. - How many? Under a score of knights and some men at arms. You hear that? We'll surround them on the hills. Trumpet up! [trumpet blowing] [horses galloping] It seems the Prince feels he needs only a handful of brave knights to save the lady. As usual, the English underestimate us. Forward! For France and St. Denis! Guards! We'll keep going through them! [indistinct shouting] [instrumental music] [indistinct shouting] [swords clanking] [music continues] There he is. Don't let him get away. [horse neighs] The prince! [music continues] [music continues] [indistinct shouting] [music continues] [indistinct shouting] Sound the retreat. [trumpet blowing] - After them! - My horse! I told you not to let him escape. - Come, we'll hit him up. - Hey! Come on! [music continues] [frogs croaking] This poor animal can't carry us both much further, My Lord. You take him. I'll follow on foot. We'll both walk and stay together. [indistinct shouting] Listen. [horses approaching] They're between us and the castle. I'm sure we can get past them in the dark. No. We won't go back at all. Sir? Supposing we did get past them, John what good would that do? You'd be safe. And your safety is a concern of England. So is the Lady Joan's freedom. Besides, I must find out what this rebellious gentleman intends to do next. Get rid of your armor. Gladly. I suppose you, uh, have a reason. I suppose I have. One way or another, you and I are gonna get into De Ville's castle. [dramatic music] My Lord. You wish to speak to me, Lady Joan? I demand that you release me and my brothers. You are hardly in a position to make demands, ma'am. I saw you and your men ride in carrying this. Presumably, you've accomplished what you set out to accomplish. You could have no further reason to keep us in prison now. Forgive me, My Lady, that decision must be mine not yours. In the meantime, I will endeavor to make your visit to us as pleasant as possible. 'Your quarters, I trust, are comfortable.' Then you did not kill Prince Edward. You can't be certain. That is why you refused to release us. He's alive and still a threat to you. Your Prince will either be dead or a prisoner within a matter of hours. I can promise you that. You will not be able to keep that promise, My Lord. I'm so hungry, My Lord. If we had another horse, I'd eat it. Don't call me "My Lord." No, My Lord. Oh, My Liege. [horses galloping] [birds chirping] Here, come on, you two. Come on, you two. Both of you, come on, get along. - Wait. - Uh? uh-uh.. - Don't be frightened, man. - You're strangers. Yes, from Calais. What's happening here? The nobles are taking men from the village. That's what's happening. They're forcing them into the army. I know how to get into De Ville's castle. They can force us into his army. That's a good idea, John. But not good enough. As common soldiers, we'd never have the freedom of the castle we need. Well, I'm too hungry to think of anything better. Then let us eat, and perhaps you'll think of something better. [laughing] [indistinct chatter] Hey, Alan. Alan, I think we need some music. Alright, soldier. Wait. More wine here, you keeper. Soothing soldiers is dry work. (Alan) In a minute, soldier. In a minute! Welcome to my inn, gentlemen. What can I offer you? Food, mountains of food. [laughs] Yes, sir. You're new to this village. Who are you? Oh, we're just, uh, travelers from... From Toulouse. [indistinct chatter] You two, your duty is not over yet. Get to your feet. Bard, send your men up to the castle. 'Go on. And you too, Jorah.' - What's the matter? - Up there, over the fireplace. (Sir John) 'The Black Armor?' Well, what about it? Aren't you trying to think of a way to enter the castle? Knight. Squire. [crowd applauding] ♪ They put me in the cavalry ♪ ♪ Wherever the army goes ♪ ♪ I've all for hospitality ♪ ♪ Throughout the Principality ♪ ♪ For everybody knows ♪ ♪ I am the girl for ♪ [laughing] ♪ A long kiss a strong kiss ♪ ♪ And a kiss for rich or poor ♪ ♪ I caught him with his visor down ♪ ♪ But hadn't time to wait ♪ ♪ And so many had been and gone ♪ ♪ But still he had his helmet on ♪ ♪ For I can penetrate any amount of armor plate ♪ [indistinct chatter] ♪ A long kiss a strong kiss ♪ ♪ And a kiss for rich or poor ♪ [indistinct singing] [crowd laughing] You have enough girls already, captain. [laughs] You've got a happy smile. Have I? Well, what I see makes me happy. You're rich perhaps. Mm, perhaps. [indistinct chatter] Isn't it a little early in the day for such a celebration? It's always like that when the soldiers come here. They'd all be drunk by nightfall. Don't you like soldiers, Marie? Tell me, do many of them come here? Why do you ask so many questions? Who are you? What's your name? Oh, just call me, Edouard. (Marie) 'Edouard.' (Alan) Here you are, sirs. - Ah. - Can I get you anything else? Well, my friend and I are a little tired. We'd like two comfortable beds. We have the finest in all France. And clean too, I hope. [laughs] Of course, sir. Gold. Thank you, sir. Tell me, Edouard, where did you get so much gold? And how can Marie get hold of some of it? Easily. Oh, you're very charming, Edouard. Marie, perhaps I can be more charming if you'd do me a small favor. Anything, Edouard. [coughs] You eat too fast, my friend. Where can we speak privately? Come to my room. But, uh, Edouard, your food. I shall return before it's cold. Oh, you're shaving. Hm. Your moustache! Yes. Yes. And with a French razor which you, as my squire, should have provided. Not Marie. In any case, it won't change your appearance enough. No? Well, I can only do the best I can. - Marie? - 'Yes.' Everyone's asleep. Now, did you manage to get another horse? Yes, it's outside, tied up next to yours. Good. Marie, you're an angel. I never saw anyone in such a hurry. [groaning] [groans] [instrumental music] (male #2) 'What are you doing?' (Edward) 'Slept well, sir?' So, you turn out to be a pair of thieves, do you? Thieves? Why, no. We're just borrowing this. And besides stealing, you dare to impersonate a knight? You know what the punishment for that is, you dog? [intense music] [swords clanking] [music continues] [music continues] Maria, for you. You've more than earned it. But you haven't left any for yourself. Where I'm going, I won't need it. Goodbye. And bless you. [dramatic music] [horses galloping] Are you ready, my trustee squire? Ready, Sir Knight. Then follow me, friend. Who goes there? (Edward) Tell your master the Black Knight wishes to speak to him. If we should succeed in getting into the castle and Lady Joan recognizes you, what then? It's your duty as my squire to advise me. - Ah! - Shh! Who calls himself the Black Knight? What is your name? I've made a vow, My Lord never to reveal my name until the enemies of friends have been defeated. A noble vow, if true. And what do you want with me? I wish to join forces with you, My Lord. I hear you pay well for the services of good fighting men. [laughing] And you consider yourself one of the best? Certainly better than that fat knight 'who stands beside you.' Libeau, test him. Fetch my horse and armor! [whispering] This is dangerous. I've seen him unhorse Sir Ellys. Besides, that old armor of yours.. [laughs] Are you ready, Libeau? Ready, Black Knight? [grunts] 'Hold! Enough!' Perhaps this knight was right, Libeau. 'You are a little too fat.' Sir Knight, give me your hand. Well, you can sit a horse. Thank you, My Lord. Before I enlist you in my service I'd like to see your face, my friend. As you wish, My Lord. Tell me, why does a man of quality wish to become a mercenary? Because, money is as useful to a man of quality as to any other, My Lord. - Well, you're honest. - Is he? He'd fight for the English if they offered him more than we do. You heard my vow. Must I remind you of it with my sword? I've been unhorsed before. But no man has ever fought me with a sword and lived! Libeau! There'll be no fighting among my knights. Time enough for jousting when the English have been driven from this land. Come, sire, let us discuss the terms of your service to France. - My squire may attend me? - Of course. See to my horse. He carries an English longbow. How did he come by that? Uh, from a dead Englishman, My Lord. Not far from here. There were signs of a recent battle. - Who won? - We did, of course. And almost speared ourselves the English prince. Indeed. Edward? What did he look like? We don't know. We only saw his back as he fled. [laughter] [instrumental music] [indistinct chatter] (De Ville) Gentleman, our guest! Eat well. Ah, that's another thing the English can't do. Make wine. I never understood why Wilhelm of Normandy ever wanted to go to that damp little island. Let alone stay there. [laughter] - My Lord, you live well here. - Yes, we do. You'll not regret that you joined us. - I hope you're right. - Huh? I said, I'm sure you're right, sir. You will ride at my right hand, sire. 'I like the way you use a lance.' (Edward) 'Very honored, sir.' But also impatient. When do we ride against the English? In due time, my friend, in due time. I'm about to join forces with the most powerful man in all France. - Uh, you must mean.. - Bertrand Du Guesclin. He is about to proclaim himself Lord High Constable. This is the king's plan? King John? How could it be? King John of France is a prisoner in London. Captured by Young Edward of England. Of course, of course. And when the English are driven out, what then? To whom should the laurels go? Who will have saved France? Du Guesclin. And.. [chuckles] Ah, the English blokes are hungry again. No wonder. They get no food at all in England. [laughs] That is the English lady I told you of. Lady Joan Holland. - You know who she is? - No. A member of King Edward's own court. Mm. She takes her meals here with you? No, no, no, I allow her to come down twice a day to get her food. More wine! She can do with a bit of fat on her. I like her just as she is. Good evening, Lady Joan. I trust you are in good health. Thank you. And now, if you will allow me.. Certainly, certainly. But first, I wish you to meet uh, one of the newest of the many knights who are flocking to our banners. This one calls himself the Black Knight. I have no wish to meet any of your mercenaries. The children's food is getting cold. If you be kind enough... The English lady shouldn't speak thus of mercenaries. Hah! Her countrymen have no hesitation in using them. That is no concern of mine. Of course not. You'll forgive me, ma'am. I merely wish to prolong the conversation. You see, a simple soldier such as myself has seldom a chance to meet so fair a lady. Thank you. [chuckles] You have a way with woman, my friend. [dramatic music] The French knight sleeps soundly. Sounder the better. [music continues] [John groaning] No, it's not from in there. Perhaps one of the knights is drunk too much. [John grunts] Hey, he may have hurt himself. I better go and see. You wait here. [groaning] [grunts] [door opens] - Who is it? - Edward. [sobbing] Oh, Edward. Why does these men come here for? Don't be afraid, darling. These are our friends. - This is... - Black Knight. That's all they need to know before I get you safely out of here. - Quick. - We must leave here quickly. Get ready. Hurry. And no noise. [instrumental music] Oh. Now, follow me. And you, shh. Not a sound out of you. Come, Joan. [music continues] [yelling] - Who goes there? - A visitor! With news for My Lord, the Count! Who sends you? Bertrand Du Guesclin. Lord High Constable of France. Open the gate. (male #3) 'No, it can't wait till daylight.' (male #4) 'Then I'll wait for Count.' [music continues] You wait here. [knocking on door] My Lord. My lord! 'My Lord!' [knocking on door] [music continues] - Well, what is it? - There's a messenger here. From the Lord High Constable of France. Constable of France? Our waiting is over. - Send the messenger to... - Look here, My Lord! [clamoring] - What happened here? - I don't know, My Lord. Somebody throttled me. Came up from behind, there was a body lying.. [intense music] (De Ville) They're gone! Sound the alarm! Sound the alarm! [bell tolling] You there, tell them to bar the gates. Search the castle. D'Estell, double the guards. (D'Estell) 'Guards!' (Sir John) What now, My Lord? If they find out that we... (Edward) They won't find out. We'll join the search party. - They're not in there. - Search the long corridor. (male #5) 'Rouse the rear guards!' You there, guard the other steps! You, that way. [indistinct shouting] We must try another time, I'll discover you now so the Count won't suspect. My Lord! Here they are, My Lord. Who planned this attempt? I did. I am not a fool, Lady Joan. Who helped you, madam? Answer me! Guards, take them back. And see that they do not get out again. Now, where is the messenger from the Lord High Constable? I'll find him, My Lord. Constable? Yes, Du Guesclin rules us now. Together we will drive out every Englishman in France. [cheering] We'll teach these dogs of English one with the touch of cold steel. Ha-ha-ha. Gentlemen, hear this! "All is ready. Tomorrow, we march." [cheering] "Meet me with all your power in the Varrenes. "As you love France, fail me not. Du Guesclin." [all cheering] For France and St. Denis! Gentlemen, be ready to move at daylight. Well, my friends, soon you'll be able to reveal your identity. Tomorrow, you will meet our country's greatest soldier and Edward of England's greatest enemy. This, uh, Du Guesclin, he'll recognize you, won't he? Yes, if he sees my face. [instrumental music] Well, Gurd, what news for us? I'm sorry, My Lord, none. I've spent many days walking through the country side. I've searched deserted huts, empty barns every possible hiding place, but not a trace of the Prince or Sir John anywhere. I've talked with cottagers and passersby but no one set eyes of them. What of the nearby villages? They're overrun with Count De Ville's soldiers. Surely the Prince and Sir John would keep clear them. Who can say what that young daredevil would or would not do? He has Sir John to advise him. If the Price has one of those wild ideas of his then dozen of Johns will make no difference. You've done your best, Gurd, and we thank you. My Lord. But wait. Have you friends you can trust? Oh, yes, My Lord. And let them know, but under pledge of secrecy that Prince Edward and Sir John Chandos escaped De Ville's ambush. But that they've not returned to the castle. You must all be on the alert for any sign of them. And if you have news, bring it to us here with all speed. I will, My Lord. Well, now, we can do nothing but wait. Wait? Again, Sir Bruce, I beg you let some of us ride out and search for the Prince, ourselves. What good would it do for them? That man knows every peasant, every hut every inch of the ground. What can you do? Except provide a target for French arrow... We will take no risks. I promise you. There's always a chance we might be fortunate, Sir Bruce. We have scarce enough men to defend this castle as it is. And De Ville may decide to attack us. He's not strong enough on his own. In any case, what do we gain by defending this castle if we've lost the prince? He must be safe. He must be. If he is, God, he is, but I'm on the rack idling my time away here. Let me go, Sir Bruce, please! 'Let me go.' [horses galloping] Now, remember, whatever happens you must not engage the enemy. We can't risk an encounter until reinforcements arrive. We understand. And if you should learn anything of the prince or Sir John, send me word at once. [instrumental music] De Ville, and ready for war. Yes, it looks like a full-scale attack. We better get back to the castle and prepare for them. But they're taking the road to Varrenes. To a meeting with more rebels, perhaps. [horse neighing] [music continues] There he is. This is what we've waited for, my friend. Come. Welcome, My Lord De Ville. You have a goodly company. This is a great moment in the history of France My Lord High Constable. May I present, a noble companion at arms. One who has sworn not to reveal his identity until the day the English have been defeated. May that day come soon. This is my aid called the Duke of Brittany. We will make our camp in the fields of Valencour. And Lord De Ville, you will ride with me. [instrumental music] [horse nickering] Ah, thank you, John. We shan't be able to keep this up much longer. - De Ville asked for you again. - What did you tell him? Oh, that you are feeling better, but still far from well. We ought to get of here now, while we still can. No, no. Let's wait until the camp's asleep. - Are the horses ready? - All ready, My Lord. No more. You may go. So, you actually had Prince Edward in an ambush, My Lord? I unhorsed him. The English were outnumbered, and yet, the prince and his best knights got away unharmed. It was a cruel misfortune, sir. My plan to get him out of the castle worked like a charm. The surprise attack was perfectly timed yet he slipped through our fingers. A pity, My Lord. A great pity. I'm still in grief. If Edward had been disposed off easily you and I will not be sharing the battle honors tomorrow. You've instructed your men carefully on the manner of the attack? They'll be no more...misfortunes? You will be supported as planned. To the death. I speak not only for myself but for all my knights. This new comer, the man without a name.. ...is it wise to give him a pride of place over friends of longer standing, like Libeau? The Black Knight is worth ten Libeaus. That remains to be seen. Some more wine? I will. - To drown my sorrows. - Sorrows? It grieves you that we fight the English tomorrow? It's always amused you, D'Estell to make me out a coward. That's got nothing to do with it. It's the injustice that rankles. Ingratitude. Whose ingratitude? De Ville's. Give me more wine. - You've had enough, Libeau. - More, I say! Sir De Ville doesn't appreciate you anymore, Libeau. Hold your tongue, man. What makes you think he doesn't? Didn't I always ride at De Ville's right hand? Haven't I always advised him honestly instead of shouting "Yes," like the rest of you? And what do I get for my place? In my place, rides this Black Knight. Well, he unhorsed you once. Yes, he unhorsed me once! But he is yet to fight me sword to sword. Libeau, come back here. (D'Estell) 'Save your venom for the English.' It's Libeau and D'Estell, coming this way. (Libeau) 'France can have my sword tomorrow' 'or the Black Knight's, but not both.' Don't be a fool, Libeau. You know the Count won't tolerate any fighting especially at a time like this. Ah! What more can he do to me? He's already given this Black Knight my place by his side. - Libeau, listen to me... - I have listened enough! - You're drunk. - Take your hands from me! You can't take any more risks, My Lord. (Libeau) 'If your not a coward, come out with your sword!' They'll be one less Frenchman to attack us tomorrow. Now, we'll see who will ride to the Count's right hand. [swords clanking] Stop! Put out your sword, Libeau. - You know the orders. - I have my pride, My Lord. You can defend that against the English. A moment, My Lord. A little entertainment on the eve of battle is a good thing. And if these two gentlemen are so eager to fight let them do so in the proper style. With lances and swords, no quarter given. As you wish, My Lord. Arm yourselves. The horse. [indistinct chatter] De Ville, let them begin. Ready? [clanking] [dramatic music] [clanking] [clanking] Prince Edward! [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] [all clamoring] [dramatic music] [yelling] [instrumental music] It's the Black Knight. What news, sir? We attack the English castle today. - Bring out the hostages. - The hostages? Yes, at once! Bring out the English hostages! [dramatic music] Pardon me, sir, but doesn't the Count wish us to follow him in the attack against the English? He does not. You are charged for the defense of the castle. The English may attack with another force, hurry. Thank you. Thank you. Where are you taking us? To a battle. Why? To frighten the English. [all laughing] Hyah! [instrumental music] (all) Death to the enemies of France! Death to the enemies of France! [all cheering] [instrumental music] They haven't passed this way, My Lord. They will. Keep watching. There they are. Fall out! Come on. Fall out! Come on! Philip, Ellys! Do you recognize that knight? The one in black armor? No. He bares no coat of ours. But that is the Lady Joan's carriage. Stand to arms! Lower the bridge! [music continues] They're gaining! The bridge is down. Head straight for it. [music continues] [indistinct shouting] Sir John. The Black Knight is the prince. [instrumental music] [music continues] [music continues] Thank God, you're safe, My Lord. Can we go after them? No, we'll go back to the castle. Du Guesclin is leading an army against us. Du Guesclin? He's joined forces with De Ville. It'll take more than our forces to hold them at bay. Well, My Lord, at least some reinforcements have arrived. - How many? - A 150 men at arms. And a hundred bowmen, My Lord. With them are more. How strong are the French, My Lord? Look for yourself. It would appear, gentleman, our wars are not yet over. By tomorrow's sunrise it will be known who shall rule in Aquitaine. Du Guesclin or we. [instrumental music] If I judged Du Guesclin correctly he's not fool enough to think he can take us by storming the walls. He may attempt a scaling operation but only as a diversion. To cover his main attack, which will be a direct drive across the moat, to our main gate. In which case, Sir Philip you will be ready with a warm welcome. Oh, we shall be ready, My Lord. (Philip) Preparations are almost complete. John? How's the wound? Oh, much better, My Lord. Thank you. Good. Whoever dressed that did well. - Who was it? - Mistress Genevieve's work. - No, really? - It is. [all chuckle] And how's the Lady Joan? Well, My Lord, her quarters are in the west tower. I'd say we have less than an hour. Du Guesclin will probably demand my surrender before he attacks. Let me know when he comes. [dramatic music] He's coming, My Lady. Oh, Edward. What.. What can I say? I'm so deeply, deeply grateful. I-I'm very... Joan, please. Don't speak of gratitude. After all, I'm responsible for the lives of every man and woman in Aquitaine. - Oh, I see. - Wait, Joan. Don't you know that your personal safety is my very, very deep concern? - Oh. - And always will be. [music continues] But, now.. Now, perhaps, it's too late. It's not too late, believe that. We'll have our lives together. [trumpet blowing] Oh, Edward, please.. ...please come back to me. Edward, Prince of Wales. You who call yourself Duke of Aquitaine. 'Present yourself.' Du Guesclin, you who call yourself Lord High Constable of France here I am. Before we take this castle and your life.. ...I call for your surrender. Our surrender? Ha-ha-ha! I thought you'd come here to offer us yours. [all laughing] You see us here drawn up before you. Look well and consider. We are ten men to one of yours. Ten French to one English? We're fairly matched, My Lord. [all laughing] Jesting fool, you choose to die. No, rebel, we choose to live and fight! England and St. George! (all) England and St. George! [dramatic music] Move up into line. Take your post. For France and St. Denis! [all cheering] (male #6) 'For France and St. Denis!' [all clamoring] Fire, now. [all clamoring] (male #7) Fall out! [all clamoring] [groans] Stay strong. [screaming] [music continues] [groaning] [groans] [clanking] [clanking] [music continues] For France and St. Denis! [groaning] [screaming] [clanking] [dramatic music] Philip! Fire! [explosion] Follow! The castle is ours! [all clamoring] - Light your bran. - 'Light the bran.' [dramatic music] More men. [all clamoring] [clanking] [all clamoring] [clanking] Wait! Du Guesclin, yield! I yield. [clanking] [clanking] [clinking] [dramatic music] [screaming] [indistinct chatter] [instrumental music] (Lady Joan) 'Edward!' [music continues] [all cheering] [instrumental music]
