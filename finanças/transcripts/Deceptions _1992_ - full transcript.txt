And the pitch to Skowron. Swing and a ground ball up the third base side. Going hard to his right, groat has it, throws over to second and they force Mantle coming in for the final out. And the score, at the end of 8 and 1/2 innings of play... Come on, Pirates! - It's the New York Yankees 9, and the Pittsburgh Pirates 9. Come on, Pirates! And Ralph Terry, of course, on the mound will be facing Mazeroski. Here's a ball one. Yeah! And the Yankees have tied the game in the top of the ninth inning. Here's the swing. And a high fly ball going deep to left field. This may do it! Going back to the wall, way back! Back to the wall goes Berra! It is..Over the fence! Home run! And the Pirates win! Ladies and gentlemen, Mazeroski has hit a Ralph Terry pitch over the left field fence at Forbes Field to win the 1960 world series! It is all over, and the Pirates are the 1960 world champions of baseball. *oh * *oh * * private dreams I never told you * *come to hold me in the dark * * moonlit skies and long embraces * *eyes that shine from lovers' faces * *you'll never know the secrets of my heart * * I know that you'll never stay in love * *call to you, we'll sleep apart * *empty arms will wait so lonely * *I'll touch the night and let it hold me * ♪ you'll never show the secrets of your heart ♪ *oh * *ooh * *oh * *ooh, yeah * * private dreams are meant for living * * I trace them with a treasure chart * *tell you all my hidden wishes * *never fly from lovers' kisses * * if you could share the secrets of my heart * *the secrets of my heart?* *the secrets of my heart * *mmm-mmm * Hey.

Thanks. Oh, I see Mr. Faro's back, huh? Uh-huh. Bessie? It's the delta from Dallas. Bessie, something's happened. 10 minutes late. What are you doing here? Senora Faro. Why aren't you at work? He's trying to tell you something, honey. I don't want to know. About senor Johnny. The mail's certified from Veracruz. It's him. I said I don't want to know. Bessie, take it. Listen, you have to take it. Ok, I took it. Alexandria, don't hit your brother. I'll tell your daddy when he gets home. Mommy, I want a cookie. Give her a cookie, will you, Marge?? Sure, honey. I remember the day he lost his teeth. Some big old tool pusher flashed his works at me Johnny took a poke at him. It was a pretty brave thing to do, too. The guy was twice his size. Marge, Marge, where you at? That's Stanley. He don't know about any of this. I better stop him coming in here. You gonna be ok? I'll be right back. Ohh. *see the pyramids along the nile * *watch the sun rise on a tropic isle * *just remember, darling, all the while * *you belong to me * *see the marketplace in old Algiers... * hey! Ha ha ha! Scared you, didn't I? No, you didn't scare me. *send me photographs and souvenirs... * yeah, I did. No, you didn't! - Hey! - Ok, full count. - To the wall! - Ha ha ha! You look like a million, Ruby. *you belong to me * it's real pretty. *I'll be so alone... * take a walk? I don't mind. Come here. * maybe you'll be lonesome, too * you know what that is, don't you? That's the ball bill Mazeroski hit. Top of the ninth, 406 feet over the left field wall. That's the ball that beat the Yankees. That's daddy. Oh. What am I supposed to do now, Johnny? Drown the kids and shoot myself? Hello, Pluto. Ay!, carajo! Hermes? Ay! Senora Faro! What are you looking for? The bank phoned, say they come manana for the inventory. I'd like to see the books. Let me see the books. Where are his accounts due? Senora? Who owes him money? Hermes, somebody must owe him money. Bills. Oh, bills! He hasn't paid any of these? No, senora. None of them? Oh. Here you are. I'm gonna take these and I'll give you 65. 85. They're not worth it, Mrs. Faro. No Roger Maris, no Mickey Mantle. All the good ones are gone. 75. $70 cash. I'll take it. I'll be back in a couple of days. There's food in the house, and here's $40 more just in case. If there's any problem, you go to Marge swimmer's house, ok? Sì, sì, senora. I gotta go now. I gotta go see to it your daddy gets buried right because he'd do the same for me. Tia Lupe and uncle Jorge are gonna take real good care of you, ok? Oh, gosh, mom loves you. Hija, hija, la maleta! I love you. Bye, mommy! - Bessie, - I never thought twice about going down to Mexico. My friends said, "he was no good to you alive. He ain't gonna do you no good when he's dead." But they never did think a lot of Johnny. They said being married to Johnny Faro was like a ride in a car with no brakes. I said, "ladies, I like the ride." I was wild about Johnny. The day I met him I stopped looking for anyone else. Sure, he was a fool with his money. He was like a big kid. Couldn't go to sleep at night till he spent his last dime. But I married him anyway. Never thought twice about that. Que tal. Como estas? La senora quiere ver un cadaver. Por aca, senora. Senora? Por favor. Do I have to look? Sì, senora. Es necesario. Oh! Burnt very, very bad head to toe. The teeth, senorita. You got the teeth? Yes, I got the teeth. For you, with my whole sympathy. Lupe! Senora! Is everything all right? Sì hay bastante comida. What's that noise? I can't hear you. Ay, perdon. La radio. Lupe, how are my babies? Estan bien. Quiere hablar con ellos? What? Senora Bessie? Bueno? Oh! Oh! Shoot! Perdon, senorita. God, I'm really sorry about that. Me and my big feet. You speak English? Well, after a fashion, yeah. Um, looks like I owe you a new pair of sandals. Oh, no. These could be repaired. They're brand-new. Ok. Well, I know just the man who could fix it. Come on. We'd better pay for our calls. Feed the world. Pardon? It's a relief organization called feed the world. We send food, grain mostly, to Somalia, to Sudan. I arrange the shipments, help raise money, whatever I can. What about yourself? What are you doing down here? I need to find a place to stay. Well, I can help you do that. - Nothing fancy. - Sure. Ya esta. - Finito, - senor? - Cinco mil pesos. - Cinco. It's right here. Andale, apurate! This is the place. This place is old, but it's comfortable. You'll be ok here. I've stayed here a couple of times myself. All right. Una recamara chica, por favor. Uh-huh. Una buena recamara con vista a la Plaza, para senorita. Sì, sì. I don't need a view or anything. $20. So what's your name? For the register. Bessie Faro. One "r" or two? F-a-r-o. Um, Mrs. or Ms.? Mrs, I believe that's Dr. Lamb over there. What do you think? Take a look. It is! Thanks. - Fergus. - Fergus? It's Irish. Oh! Oh, my granddaddy was Irish on my mother's side. Yeah, he was a real big talker, too. Oh! It's ok. Um, I'm sorry for your trouble. My husband. Dr. Lamb? Oh, no. Is that you? Oh, it is you, isn't it? How are you? I was just saying to Ms. Halverson, "that's Dr. Lamb, I'm sure of it!" We were in the audience Saturday night at the fund raiser. If we can be of any help in any way we can... Listen, by being here, you are. How did it happen? She was gonna take off, senorita, but she got away from him. The gasolina, she... Poof! What are you doing? Why are you taking my picture? A recuerdo, senorita. For remembrance. For you. For me. Le pedimos, senor, que tu siervo, muerto para este mundo viva para ti y que tu amor misericordioso borre los pecados que cometido por... Por ti, nuestro senor, amen. He had an office here? Sì. Somebody break in. There must be something left somewhere. "Feed the world." Senor Faro... He always call me hermes. Hermes? It's a very nice name, sì hermes. Hermes? What are you doing? Ah, senora Faro! What are you looking for? The bank phoned. They say they come manana for inventory. Hermes. Uh! You find something, senorita? No. Maybe I help you. Why? Icarajo! Iesquincle! Me la van a pagar. Ivayense! "B.C." "B. Cortez." Onix concepcion. Hmm. Ok. Mirra, Cepeda, Pappas. Sanguillen, Thomson. Hadds, Nelson. Must be a code. B.C. Cortez. Cortez. Banco. - Bessie, - I recognized Johnny's way of marking his horses at the racetrack. Circle the first, draw a box around the second, put an "x" beside the third, and a double "x" by the fourth. 48, 48! Ok, 287, 726. Um... I'd like to make a withdrawal. Mmm... firmelo. What?

Then the box, 1448. 1448. First national bank of Panama. X followed by double x. Oh, god. What you need is called a durable power of attorney. Durable power of attorney. I got the forms right here. Good morning, Marge. Continental from Houston. Now, you tell me the names of all the baseball players, and once I put my notary seal on here, you shouldn't have any problem at all. Now, you give one of these forms here, plus your withdrawal notice, to the bank and they'll give you exactly what you want. I'm not gonna be gone long, but I gotta go, baby, on account of your daddy. I gotta run around the bases. When I get back everything's gonna be brand new, and we'll get ourselves a big ol' house on the hill. Mm, some place where the sky doesn't rain jet fuel on the roses. De Los Angeles, todo Mexico a la capital, centroamerica, y ahi llego a Panama. Manny Sanguillen. I'd like to close this account. Here's my power of attorney. Muy bien. Ya vas pa' arriba, ahorita mas lejos. Mira, aqui las Bahamas. You must sign here to close the account, frau Mueller. 750 marks. That's it? Wie bitte? $408? There's no more? These checks were recently paid. Cashier's checks paid out to EDK Technik in east Berlin. Could I have copies, please? I know what I should have done. I should have been riding to the airport instead of into east Berlin. I mean, I'd already sent home more money than I knew how to spend. But I wanted to know what Johnny had bought for his money. Do you speak English? Of course. I'd like to speak with a manager, please? What is your name, please? Mrs. Don Mueller. Ugh. Frau Mueller... Sorry. I believe you've done business with my husband? Oh, you must forgive me, frau Mueller, herr Mueller never said that... Have you seen much of him lately? Herr Mueller's a very good friend of EDK. A very, very good customer. And what kind of business would that be, Mr. Bruchner? Why, ink. Ink? Ink. We make ink for ballpoint pens. That's all? Just ink? 34,000 marks. 25,000 marks and look... Look here, here's another one for 15. That's a lot of ink. - Ink, - frau Mueller... Ink is the lifeblood of a civilization. Good point. Thanks. Oh, Athens, our sacred city built on a mighty rock. A column of stone above a fiery plain... Alexandria, I gotto go to bed. I love you. Bye-bye. Take a walk? I don't mind. Come on. ♪ Ooh ooh ♪ ♪ Bom bom bom bom ♪ ♪ See the pyramids along the nile ♪ ♪ Watch the sunrise on a tropic isle ♪ ♪ Just remember, darlin', all the while ♪ ♪ You belong to me ♪ We stand on this hillcrest... Far into the city's flesh. Fervent and free, the people of Athens... My last card. Milt Pappas, pitcher. Won his 20th game in 1972, and I'm about to close his bank account in Athens 20 years later. Madam Pappas? Yes? I'm afraid to tell you this account is no longer. It has been closed. Closed? Yes. Since when? The 14th. Last week? Last Friday. Friday? I'm afraid I can't help you. Well, who closed the account? Why, Mr. Pappas. 2 cashier's checks to Kolatos shipping, the rest in cash. He was here? Yes. That's impossible. I saw him myself. Well, how do you know it was him? What did he look like? Like Mr. Pappas. Like a movie star. I see. Mr. Pappas has told to us he will come back. But it is against regulation for the bank to hold the contents of the box when an account has been closed. I have to find my husband. He runs away? Looks that way. And when you find him, what will you do? You will fall in his arms and forgive him. No. So, forget him. I can't. I saw them put him in the ground, Melina. I saw his body. I saw his teeth. When was that? 3 weeks ago. Dead men do not write checks. No, they don't. We wired the rest of his money to Cairo. The checks to Kolatos shipping were cashed here. That's ok. So, there's still 3 more to come, yes? No, no, no, no. This on top of this, and then... Yeah, all right. Look, sign it anyway, will ya? Ok. That's great, thanks. Ok, take care, Kolatos. Thanks. I will see you again. Bye-bye! I got 6 ships that don't go nowhere. I got to pay the dock. I got to pay the crew. Mr. Pappas paid you over $100,000. I got insurance. 2 checks, I saw them this morning. Ah, Mr. Pappas, I love! He says, "nikos, do me a favor. He wants to feed the world." Ok, I got a big heart. I got a heart... Feed the world? So I'll lose money. It's easter. I lease his friends a slow boat to Cairo. Cairo? You like Cairo? You want to go to Cairo? I got a nice little cabin. The captain's Tomatis. It's my best ship. Mr. Pappas is shipping ink to Cairo? - Ink? - Ink. Who said ink? Not ink? Who eats ink? I'd like to talk to Mr. Pappas. I want to see Mr. Pappas. Well, everybody wants to see Mr. Pappas. No, this is important. You.. Pregnant? I'm his wife. From the moment I opened that safe deposit box and saw that last card, I knew you were alive and it went through me like a shot. And all along me thinking I knew you like a book, thinking you'd done all of this for me and the kids. Guess I was wrong, huh, Johnny? Or should I call you Mr. Mazeroski? But Kolatos is right. Nobody eats ink, especially with a shipload of grain coming their way. I'm sticking with the grain, Johnny, because I want to find you. I want to look you in the eye. I want to see if I still believe you when you lie to me. I'm in Alexandria. Alexandria, Egypt. Hello? Hello? Ugh. "Thionyl chloride. EDK technik." I didn't know what Thionyl chloride was, but I was sure it wouldn't feed the world. For most of the long ride to Cairo, the driver talked nonstop about how strange it was for a woman to be traveling alone, but he didn't know the half of it. Finally, we got to Al-Mugamma, the hall of records in Cairo where all foreign residents have to register. I was more determined than ever to find Mr. Mazeroski, no matter what it took. I'm looking for a foreign resident. You have come to the wrong place. Miss abou seif, you have to help me. I must find someone, a friend, an American. You need to find someone who has a reason to help you. Well, that's why I'm here. That's why I'm talking to you. In 2 days, is starting ramadan. You know what is ramadan? Ramadan is the holy month. You must come back in 30 days. I don't have that long. You see this skinny thing? This is miss Hakim. Miss Hakim goes to the university. She's much cleverer than me, but she's a timid creature. Her mother was frightened by an ostrich. If you could help with miss Hakim's education, we could ask her to help us. Oh... Ok. For miss Hakim. Where are you staying? The mena house hotel. Please, write the name of your friend. "Bill Mazeroski." And I'm also happy to say that thanks to the hard work and the generous support of the teachers against famine, another 17 tons from the e.E.C. That's been held up in Greece has finally arrived. Ed here has got his hands on 23 trucks? 24. I don't know how he does it, and he always tells me it's best not to ask, but he's done it again. Ed, come on, take a bow. Uh... So, things are on the move, and we're going to move heaven and earth to get this food to the people that need it. It's not going to be easy, but it never is. Thank you. Bessie! Bessie, it's great to see you. Bessie? I prefer Elizabeth. Don't you? Well, I don't knowv. I'll have to think about that. But, tell me, what are you doing here in Egypt? Johnny Faro, that name mean anything to you? He pays your bills, writes your checks. Oh, listen, Elizabeth. I just make the speeches. If you want to talk about bills, you have to speak to Ed. Ed. Ed. Ok, where's Ed? Look, what is all this? Why are you so angry? Excuse me. Angry? I'm not angry, Dr. Lamb. I'm desperate. I don't know who it was I buried in Mexico, but I know one thing, dead men don't write checks. I'm here to find my husband, and I think you know where he is. I'm tired, and I want to go home, and if I don't find him soon, I'm gonna start screaming. And you know what I'm gonna be screaming, Dr. Lamb? What? Thionyl chloride. Thionyl chloride from EDK Technik in east Berlin. A man named Bruchner, looks like Boris Karloff? Look, I don't understand this. That grain shipment my husband paid for from Greece, that shit was carrying Thionyl chloride. You're a doctor. You know what Thionyl chloride's for. How do you know? I looked it up. How do you know about the cargo? I was there. I was on the ship. One of your sacks sprung a leak in Alexandria. Number 2357. I saw it! I wrote it down on the back of my hand. Who is that woman? Come on. Come on. Right here. Get them to stuff, will you? Is this here the manifest for this load? Yeah? Jesus Christ. Ed! Would you wait over there? No. Bessie... Elizabeth, please? No. Hi. Problem, doc? It seems there's a couple of sacks missing here, Ed. Is that right? Yeah, well, well, look. 2348, 2349, 2400. That's 50 sacks, Ed. 50? That's nothing. The boys on the docks, drivers. I mean, a town like this, there's a thief born every minute. Shit, 50 sacks, it's cheap! Do you know Johnny Faro? Who's your friend? I'm his wife. John Faro? Yes. Never heard of him. Of course, I'm hopeless with names. Dr. Lamb'll tell you that. Any beer inside, Ed? I'd love a beer. You get a beer. I'll wait over here. Come on. 50 sacks, Ed. Wanna feed the world, doctor? Wanna get this dry desert red down south, where it'll do some good? You need transport. You need trucks. You need boats. You need barges. Trucks cost money. Trucks need diesel. Diesel costs money. That's my job. To get the job done. If I have to improvise, if I have to twist somebody's arm, if I have to make a deal with trash, then... Trash like who? This guy Faro? Trash like you don't wanna know about. That's my job, too, doc. Now, I've been doing that job in some of the lousiest countries in the world since you dreamt about the peace corps! Thionyl chloride, Ed! Just do you job, and I'll do mine! You get the food. I'll get the transport! Do you know what Thionyl chloride's used for? Let me tell you what it's used for. Yes, I know what it's used for. It's a fair-traded substance. You use it for ball point pens. Ink for ball point pens. Bollocks! It's used for making poison gas, Ed. Poison gas for chemical weapons. Is that a fact? For god's sake, Ed, what do you think we're doing here? We're here to try and do some good. We're here to try and make a difference. We're not in the job of running poison gas up and down the middle east. Now, this guy Faro... do you know where he is? No, I don't. I park the truck. I walk around the block. When I get back, the sacks are gone. Honest to god. There's a line, Ed. If you can't draw the line, if you don't know the difference, maybe you should go home. You gonna fire me? I don't know why I don't. No, Ed. It's up to you! I never had a chance. The way he looked at me, the things he said, the way he said them. Johnny Faro was the most beautiful man I'd ever seen. And I've seen a few. I was waiting on tables at the pyramid cafe in Cairo, Kentucky, and Johnny came into town with his airplane. He landed it right in the middle of the football field. Took me for a walk down by the river. Told me a bunch of lies. I believed him, too, every word. "You look like a million, Ruby," he'd say. "You belong to me." "Ruby"? Ruby Cairo, he called me. He liked to call me that. He gave me a ring. It turned my finger green. You're still in love with him. I am. I can't do anything about that. There's nothing anybody can do about it. It's worth a try. Faro. F-a-r-o. Yes. Ok, I'll wait. Sure. Sure, I'll wait. You ready to go? 10 minutes. Listen, uh... About that thing. The, uh... The ink. I'm sorry. Me, too. I'll see you outside. Get up, Joe. What's your secret, Dr. Lamb? Secret? What are you talking about? Everybody's got a secret. Everybody but me. Do you say your prayers? Come with me. I'd like to show you something. Most of these people have been here all night. They pray until they drop. You wonder where they get their strength to carry on, but... When you've been here long enough, you soon see where it comes from. They're all taking care of somebody poorer than themselves. There's real charity here. These people know about things the rest of the world has forgotten. They know how to pray, and they know how to look after each other. That's why they smile so much. I didn't come to the middle east to feed the poor. I was in the oil business in the Gulf. I had 2,000 people working for me. I had a million-dollar house that I didn't live in. I had cars that I didn't drive. I was drinking a bottle of brandy a day. I woke up one morning, dying of thirst, and... Well, these people saved my life. I wish... So do I. Thanks. Yes. Ohh. I'll come back. See you later. Wait for me! Please. May I? Help yourself. Ramadan has begun. I know. It is permitted to eat after sunset. For miss Hakim. Miss Hakim is very fond of Turkish delights. And we must be very nice to miss Hakim. Miss Hakim has found your Mr... Mazeroski. Where? Not far. I want to see him. We will go... tomorrow. Quick, quick. Come on. Hurry. Stay with me. Come! You must do as I say. Cover your head. Don't look at anyone. That you, Mr. Mazeroski? Bill Mazeroski? You lookin' for me? You the one's been stealing from me? The one threw away good money to find me? You were pretty cheap. Bessie. Why'd you do it, Johnny? Come on. Help with your bag. Mr. Bill. Mr. Bill. Come on. Please. Hey there. It's ramadan. I know. How'd you find the money? I had a little luck. You call that luck? What do you call it? I call it a home run. I found your baseball cards in Mexico. Onix conception, Manny Sanglillen. Sanguillen. Sanguillen. You took all the money? Hermes. You didn't tell him. You didn't. I didn't tell a soul. That's good. Smart. You think I'm stupid? How much did you get? $840,650.53. Nah, I don't think you're stupid. You always did have a head for figures, Bessie. I married a thief. I gotta have. "I pecked at the eyes of Jesus as he hanged upon the cross." "The book of the law." What's this? What law? It's... it's just a book. Close your eyes. Come on. Keep 'em closed. Now, this is something I was gonna give you... Something I've been keeping for a long time. You like it? It's kind of flashy, Johnny, isn't it? Even for you. You think I... You think I'm on vacation here? It's my business. It's a business! Shit! Ok, you wanna know the truth? I'll tell you the truth. I've been skimming a little from the guys I work for, and it ain't business. I figure I earned it. If it wasn't for hermes I would've got away with it, too. That son of a bitch was on to me. I know what's in the sacks, Johnny. I know it ain't ink. You don't understand. Life is different here. This ain't a city. It's an ant heap. Ants got it better than these people. And there's millions of 'em. World's full of 'em. They're all gonna die before they get old... Most of 'em. And that's all they have to look forward to. Half the people on earth would be better off dead. Nobody's better off dead. Except me, right? Where are you going? It's over, Johnny. I don't even know who you are anymore. Wait a minute! We got things to talk about. What are we gonna do, Bessie? We're not gonna do anything, Johnny. We did it. You can't do this. Oh, yes, I can. You're a dead man, remember?? You're the one came all this fucking way! For what? I wanted to get myself a good look at you. I've done that. I kind of like the beard. I like the teeth. I like the house. But I believe I can do better. I believe I deserve that. You think you can just walk out on me, Bessie? Is that what you think? I took the ride, Johnny. Now I'm getting off. Get out of my way. Let's go home. No. Ruby... You're my girl. You belong to me. Bessie. I can't let you go, Bessie. What are you gonna do, Johnny? Shoot me? Not if you come home with me... Unhh! Aaah! Unngh! Aaaah! Hermes! Unhh! Uhh! Stop it! Stop it! Hermes. Lo siento, senor Johnny. No! Aaah! We have entrusted our brother to follow Christ... I'll never forget you, Johnny. I'll try to remember the man you used to be. But I've got to let you go now. Father, son, and the holy spirit be with you and sustain you now and always. Amen. Amen. These people saved my life. I wish... So do I. Off the lawn! Off the lawn means off the lawn! I don't have to put up with this! Yeah! Come on! Bessie, come on! Isiguele! Come on, Bessie! Come on! Yeah, Bessie! Ok, Bessie, here it comes. I'll show you my mad Margarita pitch. Imuy bien, senora Marge! Come on, Bessie! Whoa! Ohh! Catch it, catch it, somebody! Catch it! Unhh!
