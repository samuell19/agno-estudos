I'm Fitipaldi' We got into a parking lot and saw one of those american cars I got inside, started the engine and began to drive Suddenly, I lost control and crashed a street lamp Yeah, my shoulder still hurts from that that was some crazy shit I got started in this when I was 12 I was on my way to school with another kid and I said to him 'I don't feel like going to school this afternoon' So we went to the park and We saw two kids with a bike A very fancy bike I said 'If he doesn't want to give it to me, I'll have to hit him' And my buddy said '?Didn't you want one? So there you have it' So I got on the bike and started to ride Now tell us what happened afterwards Well, later on I was riding down the street on the bike And then comes some guy who pushes me to the ground And starts to kick me around And I thought to myself 'Is this guy crazy, drunk or what?' and he said 'you bastard, you stole my son's bike' 'I'm gonna kill you' What a bastard The first time I went to do a job I felt very very afraid I was sweating There were three of us a guy with a Curro Gimenez razor I was carrying an axe and the other guy had the gun We went upstairs to the office I opened the door And found four suckers there who just looked at me and kept on working I hit the table with the axe and shouted This is an assault! I had to leave the axe there and go But we took the money with us The first time is the hardest one Look at those faces, all broken Bullet holes all around the child is armless Such a beatiful monument so important How it looks! Head of the Profanated Image of the Sacred Heart of Jesus What could have happened to this one? Ask one of those old ladies Madam, please, could you tell me whathever happened to this one? Yes son, that was the head of the Sacred Heart of Jesus Which was fusilated and dinamited by the reds during the war It must have been guilty of something Or at least I think so Which war are they talking about?

Can't she control herself? Let's see if you can come back fast this time Hurry up!

Are you getting married with Pablo? I don't think so that just ties you too much But if you're living with a man you're surely tied to him No, because at any point if you want to split, you split But you can split even after being married At the very end, what's marriage A priest, a blessing, a piece of paper Definitely not Do you want to smoke one? OK Look at them they're driving like crazy And then something goes wrong you cant leave them all alone They're driving like crazy Because they're desperate to get home So the wife opens the door Gives them little kiss And asks 'How was your day at work? and they say 'Fine, I'm just a little tired' Then she turns the TV on Start arguing with the son If a son dares to punch me I swear I'd kill him I'm going to the sea Who comes to the sea with me?
