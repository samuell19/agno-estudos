(wind blowing) (music and birds chirping) Susan! Get away from that, you little... Don't ever touch those nasty things again! (wind blowing) (music) See the Spider? It wants to be your friend. I found it under the bed. It came all the way from China just to see you. You wanna play with it? Susan! You nasty little girl! Ooh! How many times have I told you to leave those filthy things alone? Ow! - Ugh! - You killed my pet! I hate you! You killed my pet! (dripping noise) Daddy. Hey, there's my little girl. And you're not suppose to be in here. What's a matter, honey? She killed my pet... and it was a pretty spider. Don't worry, we'll find you another one. I love you, Daddy. Taking her side already! Run along - She was playing with those disgusting spiders again. - Now, Martha. - Don't you how Martha me. I've had it. What she needs is a good whipping. She's not going to be spanked. Oh, well, we'll see about that. Either you do something about it or I will. Aren't you being a little rough on her? - She's just a curious girl. - Curious? Oh. I am sick of her. I am sick of you and I am sick of living in this slimy mausoleum. (door screeching) (birds chirping) (door closes) You better hurry before the ice melts. You look lovely in black. Just practicing. How could two brothers be so different? Mmm. You know, you got guts. I could throw a rock and hit the mortuary from here. Oh, being with you is worth it. As long as your careful. Another week we won't have to be careful. Mmm. Mmm. (laughing) What are you laughing at? Just thinking, with him dead, what mortuary shall we use? (laughing) Mmm. I am sick of the whole mess. I refuse to discuss it. I can't control her. She belongs in a private school away from here. Absolutely not. Ugh, it's those filthy spiders. They give me the creeps! She actually loves them. Why not? Have you ever given her any love? Oh, don't you blame me! You've always taken her side. You love that... her more than you ever loved me. Martha... (sigh) That's not true and you know it. Oh! Don't touch me! You smell of chemicals and death. From now on, you stay out of my room. (clock chiming) (door slams) Walter, I can't take it anymore. I can't wait another week. I want him dead now. I know it won't be long. You're right, I will. I love you, darling. (eerie music) (humming) (eerie music) (suspenseful music) (terrified cries) (terrified gasps) (crashing noise) Mother? That he gave His only begotten Son, that whosoever believeth in Him should not perish, but have everlasting life. Thank you, Walter. I don't know what I would have done without you. That's what brothers are for. (music) Nice girl How did you like that fly? Ah, that a girl. Next time it will be a nice juicy cricket. Yeah. That a girl. Nice, Jennifer. Pretty girl. Nice, Jennifer. Good girl. That's my baby. Goon. That a girl, Jennifer. That a girl. That's my girl, Jennifer. That's my girl. I'm sorry to disturb you, hun, but the boys will be here soon and I need your help. Are they eating any better? They certainly are. It's going to be lonely without you. Well, a week isn't along time. And I know you can take care of yourself. Why don't you call Linda. Now, I'm sure her mother will let her stay over here while I'm gone. I don't think so. Oh, Dad. After all these years are they still giving you a rough time? They either just ignore me or they make fun of me. And all because I'm a mortician Too bad I'm not in a livelier profession. (laughter) Oh, Dad. Now, you don't worry about those punks. You're a very attractive young lady. You'll have plenty of friends. I hope you're right. Trust me, Susan. (doorbell ringing) I'll get it. Ah, the livelier member of the Bradley family. Hello. - Ha ha. - And the prettiest. Well, how are my two biggest fans? We too early? No, my father's been waiting for you, but Uncle Walter isn't here. Ah, but there's where you're wrong. Does anyone need a ticket fixed? I caught you. You're on my Ten Most Wanted list. Hello, Uncle Walter. Is this a convention out here? Ah, our next attorney general. - That's a tad premature, John. - Come on. Let's go to work, Walter. I'll be right with you, spoiled sport. You know, you're as lovely as your mother was. Remember, Susan, if you need anything when your dad's away, just give aloud... whistle. That's my girl. You can't be serious, Walter. You've done an outstanding job. The town's never had 2 better chief. Well, I appreciate your vote of confidence, Ralph. I'm gonna need all the help I can get. Well, you can count on us. Well, that means you'll be out campaigning most evenings. What about Susan? Susan's used to being alone. Well... I'm sure all of us here will, uh. Keep an eye on her. Now, be good. And if you need anything, Uncle Walter will be close by. I'll miss you. Have a good time. - Bye. - Bye. (music) (telephone ringing) Yes? "Hi, its me." Who? Me, Joe Penny. Hi, Joe. You still there?

We just wanna borrow a little coffin for a little ol' party we're gonna have. No! Just get out of here. Doesn't she look nice tonight, huh? - Ha ha ha! - She does, look at her I bet you got a hot date with ol' Joe Penny, hasn't she? Ha ha ha! You know, you don't look half bad when you get yourself all fixed up, Susan. Hey, I got an idea. Let's take Susan along with us, huh? That is a good idea. No!

(yelling and laughter) Hey, stop it! Will, you look out! Look out! Hey, he's afraid of the spiders, huh? I'm not afraid of the spiders. No! No! - No! - I'm not afraid of spiders. Ah, he is afraid of the spiders! Well, go ahead and take one then. No! No! I'm not afraid of it! He's afraid of it! - I'm not afraid of it. - Ha ha ha ha.

(screaming) Are you happy? Do you like killing, is that it? Yeah, let's get out of here. Wha- wha- what about the casket? Forget it, let's just get out of here. (eerie music) Susan, you all right? Why, Joe? I don't know. They just always gotta be proving something, I guess. They didn't have to kill em'... I wish there was some way I could pay em' back. What do you think will happen now? They'll brag about killing your spiders and... make fun of you. Just forget about it. I just wish there was... I wish I could think of some way to make them leave me alone. Talkin' to em' won't do any good. Besides, they'll all be at the drive-in getting drunk. I know. Come on, Susan, there's nothing we can do about it now. I guess not. (multiple voices speaking) (multiple voices speaking) Hey, you all hand me one of those. - Come on. - Here, I've got it. Here, honey. - We'll share this one, okay? - Okay. Can I share... I want to share with you. Okay, we'll share one. Thank you. Ha ha. Hey, great flick, you know? - Women. - Ha ha ha. I don't know, uh... - Mmm. - What, I am pretty cute. - Watch this. - Thank you.

Come over here. It's better over here, you know. Ha ha ha. Are you kidding? Come on, let's watch the film. (voice on drive-in speaker) (mumbling) That's very difficult. (ominous music) (voices on drive-in speaker) Watch your hands. - Why? - Ha ha ha. Stop it. Honey. Honey, don't be tickling me. Don't tickle me, stop. Ahh! (loud terrified screaming) (screams) Get off! (screams) Get off! (screams) Get off! (screams) Get off! (screams) Get off! (screams) Get this thing moving! - Get away! - Get away! Get away! (screams) Got to get out! (painful moaning) Oh, my god. (trembling sounds) (voices on drive-in speaker) (music) All right, out, out. This isn't a motel. Oh, my god. You'll have to talk to her later, Chief. Well, the hell with that. (voice paging doctor) You just bring her around. I don't care how you do it, just..do it. And I say you stay away from her. Look, I'm sorry. I just don't know what happened. Maybe, they freaked out. They didn't freak out. They didn't find anything. No drugs, no nothing. Well, she can't help you now. You've got to realize that she needs rest. Please! Joan. Joan, can you hear me? Can you tell me what happened? (loud screaming) Sorry you had to cut your trip short. I'm, still stunned. Everyone is. It's hit this town pretty hard. How could it happen? That's the hell of it. We just don't know. Anything like this ever happen? No. You know this town is pretty frightened. Did you find anything, anything the lab could have missed? Not a thing. Well, I'll see you tomorrow. What are you doing here? Just swinging. It was so... hot and stuffy in there. Would you like to take... a walk with me? No. I just want to sit and listen to the quiet. Are you all right? Fine. Sorry, about your friends. Eric and that girl, Tracy. Thank you. Susan. Goodnight, Susan. You better go in. It's getting cool. Eric. Eric. I brought you a present. Someone to keep you company. Forever. Treat him more gently this time. The Lord is my Shepherd; I shall not want. He maketh me to lie down in green pastures. He leadeth me beside the still waters. He restoreth my soul. He leadeth me in the paths of righteousness for His name's sake. Yea, though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil. For thou art with me; thy rod and thy staff... (paging doctor over speaker) I thought everyone was at the funeral. - , I think it's better 10 give comfort to the living. Well, I-I'm really not sure she's ready to have visitors yet. Well, the doctor said it was all right. Well, keep it short. I- I never wanted to hurt you, but... they made me do it. I had to do it. Believe me, I didn't want to hurt you. Please, forgive me. Forgive you for what, Susan? Forgive you for what? Nothing. Your lying. I am sorry about Joan and Tracy. Joan wasn't even 2 friend of hers. That's just it. And she was acting as if she knew all about what happened. What'd she say? She was telling Joan she was sorry. For what? That's what you got to find out. So you figure she had something to do with it, huh? I know she did. I know it! Susan. I'll take care of her myself. (music) Susan. Bo. Hi. Hello. Uh, hey... After what's happened and all, I... I want to apologize for what we did the other night. Okay. Uh, look, I'm no angel. I never have been. I never even pretended to be. I... I did want to say that I like you and... that I am sorry. Thank you, Bo. I better go. Well, - um Hey, uh... What's on your agenda tonight? Nothing, why? Well, why don't we two get together and, uh... You know, we can talk or something. Okay? Okay? - Okay. - Beautiful. Hey, I got 2 surprise for you. Hey, see, I told you I had 2 surprise for you. Hey, see, I told you I had 2 surprise for you. Please take me home. Hey, what's a matter? It's suppose to be a good movie. I don't like drive-ins. [ We got the best spot in the house, huh? Please take me home, please. Hey, we just got here. Hmm? Hey, what's a matter? I won't bite. Come on. Why'd you bring me here? I told you it's suppose to be a good film. No, I mean here. Hey, what's a matter, you superstitious or something? I just want to be alone with you. Is that the only reason? What other reason would I have? (sighs) All right, we'll just talk. About what? I don't know. I'll think of something. Sit and enjoy. Hey, you like mysteries? Huh? Do you know when the... the detective tracks down the clever killer? Not really. No, I don't. What do you like then? Well, you really want to know? Hey, I wouldn't ask if I didn't want to know. Well... I like... fun pictures, you know. Like comedies and musicals and. Happy endings. That's right. You know, everything just seems So... unhappy now. Everything is so... down. Terrible things are happening. That's why I like happy endings. I like everything... fresh and alive. How were my friends killed? What? How were my friends killed? I don't understand. I had some friends of mine who saw you out here the night that Tracy and Eric got it. That's a lie. Who told you those lies? Tell me! You told me you were sorry. What are you trying to prove? Why are you doing this to me? That you had something to do with it! Hey, you come back here! I'll find out! I'll find out then I'm gonna get you! He... He lied. He said he was... He was sorry. And now he's... He's trying to close in on me. They all want to close... in on me. They want to take me away from you. And... if they do that... there won't be anyone to take care of you. Don't you understand? You can't survive without me. Yeah, you were right, Nancy. Yeah. Well, she must of had something to do with it. No, I didn't, but I'm gonna keep after her fill I do. You can bet on that. Yeah. Right after work tomorrow. For sure. First floor is the only thing you got to worry about. Just got to make sure those joints won't leak. Well, if they'd put it in before they put the insulation in, we wouldn't be up here doing this. Well, we just got to be thankful that... this is the only place that's had any trouble, that's all. What a way to spend a Saturday. I don't like it either, but that inspector is gonna be here first thing Monday morning. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Look, I'd do it myself, but I can't get into - those place anymore. - Ha ha ha. You get up one of those ducts, I'd given up my Sunday and come down here and cut you out of the damn thing. - Ha ha ha. - Ha ha ha. I'm gonna go over to the Henderson job. I'll be back in a couple of hours. All right. (banging metal noise) (eerie music) (eerie music) (banging metal noise continues) Who's there? Who's out there? (terrified sound) Hel... Help me! Help! Help me! Help me! (loud terrified screaming) I cant... I can't get out of here. I gotta get out. I can't stay here. I gotta... I gotta get... I...! I can't get out! (crying and sobbing) God. I gotta get out! (fearful whimpers) (loud screaming) (dispatcher's voice on radio) He was perfectly all right an hour ago. How was he... (mumbling) Wes, take him to my car. I have a bottle in my glove compartment. Come on. (indistinct voice on the radio) Wes. Yes, chief. What do you think? I don't know, the way he was jammed in there. Suffocation? Sure was tough to get him out. Well, I guess it's up to the coroner. Look at the lovely flowers someone left for you at the desk. There. Come on, don't you want to get out of bed? It'll make you feel better. Get up and walking around, you'll be going home in a couple of days. There. You look a lot better. Don't you feel better? Get out of that nightgown and put on your clothes. It'd be good to get home, won't it? Yeah. Just a second (loud screaming) Doctor! Doctor! Doctor! I don't know what happened. Well, you had better come up with an answer. My first concern is for my patient. Now, look, Morgan, you have coddled that girl. You've prevented me from talking to her. Now, get off that and find 2 Way for her to talk. She's over the edge, for good. (voice paging over speaker) Maybe, you better to talk to Nurse Hamilton. Yeah, maybe, I better. She's quiet now. What happened? She was doing fine, walking around, seeing things. What was she doing? Well, she was walking around and and walked over to the window. She saw the flowers. Well, she saw the flowers and just went to pieces. Are trying to tell me that she flipped out over some flowers? Now, it had to be something else. Well, after I got her back in bed, I went and looked at the flowers and... It was just a harmless garden spider so I thought... Spider? Well, just a garden spider and I didn't want it in the room 0 I... killed it. Spider. Hello, Uncle Walter. How's my favorite gin? Okay, I guess. Hop in, I'll give you a ride home. Too bad about Bo Richards. You know it's strange the way Bo died. All wedged in there. Like the devil was after him. I take it he wasn't one of your all-time favorite guys. He didn't like me, I didn't like him. Is that why he was screaming at you in the drive-in? Where'd you hear that? Just a cop doing my job. So he was a creep. He was dirt. Remember, Susan, your my favorite girl. I don't want to see you unhappy. I suppose nothing has turned up about Bo. I suppose nothing has turned up about Bo. Not a clue. Thank you. I mean, could he have been scared to death? He backs in there, something frightens him, he panics. And maybe, he suffocates. Susan, what do you think could have caused it? I have no idea. Well, it's just a thought. Shake... Spider... They like dark places, don't they, Susan? I believe so. Well, there's a bright side to the story. The girl that was in shock in the hospital, well, she's feeling better. (sigh) And she'll be able to tell us exactly what happened in that drive-in. (exhales) That was a fine dinner, Susan. You'll make a fine wife for someone. She will indeed. Are you still seeing Joe Penny? Excuse me, I have some work to do. See you tomorrow, Susan. She's very upset about that boy's death. That's a shame. (phone ringing and typing noise) That's a serious charge, Nancy. I know she's your niece, but I know she killed Bo. - Look, if this is true... - It is true! I'll see that justice is carried out, relative or no relative. But these wild charges are meaningless. Please, listen to me. She killed him! What proof do you have? Hmm? Don't you see? Everyone who was at the mortuary that night is dead. That's not proof. That's just a strange and tragic coincidence. Hey, you're wrong! The night before Bo died he called me. What did he say? He was sure Susan had something to do with their deaths. Is that it? You don't believe me, do you? Look, my job is to find evidence. So far, you given me nothing. If you won't help me I'll find someone who will. I'll do it myself! Nancy! Nancy! (telephone ringing) (honking horn) (suspenseful music) Hello, Uncle Walter, dad's in back. I didn't come to see my brother. I came to talk to you. It's urgent. Okay. What is it? A girl came to my office and she made very wild and strange accusations about you. - About me? - Mmm hmm. Well, what did she say? Nancy, said that you were responsible for Bo's death. - That I'm... - Mmm hmm. And for the kids in the drive-in. Do you believe that? Susan, it's not what I think. I mean the girl's hysterical. But she can do a lot of damage in this town. And there's certain evidence that, uh... points directly to you. What are you going to do now? I can protect you. I can calm her down. I can convince the town people that she's wrong, but I need your cooperation. We're family. You're so lovely. No one will hurt you. No. We have to look out for each other. No, please, no. I'll take care of everything. Everything will be just... fine. Nancy! What are you doing here? You lied to me. I saw you through the window. Nancy, just wait a minute. Let's be reasonable. She's crazy. She killed them and you're protecting her. Do you know what that kind of talk can do to me? I mean to my career? I mean, do you? I've worked too hard. I've worked... too hard... to let anyone... (ominous music) ruin it. (whimpering) (crying) (yelling and struggling) (heaving breathing) RC was out huntin'. Found her lying here. Oh, lord. Did you find anything helpful? Nothing. Well... I guess I have to break the news to Mrs. Drury. I want an autopsy report as soon as... possible. Will do. Is that all? It's better than nothing. Great. At least we know that she wasn't sexually assaulted. Look, I know it ain't much to go on, - but... - Ain't much? It's down to zero. You did a fine job, Dad. She looks so peaceful. Once I get all the air out of her coffin, and she's hermetically sealed, she'll look this lovely for years. (clock chiming) You better get going. I should be back by eleven. You know, those campaign meetings last forever. Well, try and have a good time, okay? (suspenseful music) Susan. What are you doing in my room? Get out! I've come to talk about your future... and mine. Our future. What do you mean? I know how it feels. We're even closer now. - What are you talking about? - Listen, it's all right. Everything will be just fine. I've taken care of everything. What are you talking about? Listen, it's all right! Everything will be just fine. I've taken care of everything. You've taken care of what? No one, will ever know. It will be just like Bo and all the others. Others? What are you talking about? Nancy. Ah, yes. She wanted to put you away. So I had to stop her! We can be together now. You killed Nancy! I did it for you! I did it for you! Don't fight me, I've waited too long for this. - Too long. - No. No! (loud screaming) Ugh. Oh please! Susan. I... Can't move! Susan. Please, help me up. I can't move. I can't move! (panting) Please. Please. It hurts. Susan. Susan. Susan. Help me! Help me! No. (sigh) Why, Susan? Why? Why, Susan? You destroyed my family. You made me kill my mother. Susan. Yes. (painful yelling) Su...! Susan! (painful crying) Susan! Susan, please. Please! Susan. You're hurting me Susan. I never wanted to kill your father! (coughing) Okay, Susan. (painful struggling) What's that? Susan. Agh! Oh! Susan, please! Susan. (coughing and panting) Susan. Susan. Susan. Please! Help me. Susan. Please, what are you doing? Susan. Susan. Susan, I'm your uncle, Susan. I'm your uncle. Susan. (music and clock chiming) (coughing) Oh, don't. Susan. Susan. (coughing and choking) Susan. I really love you. We could make a life together. Susan. They'll find out! (eerie music) (eerie music) (background conversation) Oh. Oh, Susan. I won't touch you. I promise you. Please, stop! Don't freak out. Susan, what are you doing? Susan! Susan, please. Ugh! Ugh! Susan. Please! No, Susan! Please! I ca- can't, not like this. Susan. Listen, I-I'll never touch you again. Susan. No! No, Susan! No! No! No, Susan! Susan. Susan. Susan, let me out. Susan. Susan. No. No. Don't do this. I'm your uncle, Susan. Please, they'll find out. No. (moaning) Susan! Susan! (coughing) No, Susan. Please, no. Please, help your uncle. They'll find out. Wait! (suspenseful music) (muffled speaking) Susan. I can't breathe. (muffled pleading) Susan, I'll suffocate. I'll suffocate, Susan. I... I can't breathe! Susan! I can't breathe. Don't, leave me. Please! Please! Not like this, Susan. Please. Ugh... I cant... I cant... I can't breathe! Please, Susan! Please, get me out. (moaning) (faint coughing) No, Susan. No, help me, Susan. Help me. Help me. Don't leave me, Susan. Don't leave me. Please, don't leave me. - Help me. - Goodbye, Uncle Walter. Help me, Susan. Don't do this to me. Please, Susan. Please! I... I'll suff... I... I'll suffocate! Don't, Susan. Don't... Hi, Dad. Goodnight. (music) Sleep well.
