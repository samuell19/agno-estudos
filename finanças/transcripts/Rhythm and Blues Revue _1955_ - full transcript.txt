Well, ladies and gentlemen, we're about ready now to start the show rolling with some good music-- one of the greatest musical aggregations in the country, the entire world. They top everything, and they're going to have a good old-fashioned jam session. You ready for a jam session? All right, let's get back now. Get ready to clap your feet and your hands, because here is Lionel Hampton and the band. [MUSIC - LIONEL HAMPTON AND HIS BAND] [APPLAUSE] -Thank you very much. And now, ladies and gentlemen, it gives me great pleasure to present to you one of the country's biggest and most outstanding record artists. A young lady whose records have created quite a sensation all over this old country of ours. She's here with us tonight. Here she is, Miss Faye Adams. How are you, Faye? Nice to have you here, dear. What are you going to sing for us tonight. -Well, I guess it's "Every Day." -"Every Day." Nice work if you can get it. "Every Day," Faye Adams. [MUSIC - FAYE ADAMS, "EVERY DAY"] -(SINGING) Every day a heart somewhere is broken. I'm sorry that this time it's mine. I'm so in love with you every day. I know our love's dying.

[APPLAUSE] -And now, ladies and gentlemen, I'd like to introduce to you at this time one of the finest dances that you've ever seen. Now to stand here and make a long, long speech about him would really be keeping you away from a great treat. What with his many Broadway appearances, nightclubs, and theaters throughout the country, I bet you've seen him before. If you haven't you're in great treat right now. Freddie, open the curtains, and let's bring on Bill Bailey. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC PLAYING] -A little bit of Bojangles. Now [INAUDIBLE] Do that, buddy. Here's what Bojangles calls "skipping down Main Street." Used to love this one. That's one of my [INAUDIBLE] that he would do. [INAUDIBLE] step. Ain't it boys? Bring me on home! -I'm especially happy to present the next artist to you, because I've known him for many, many years. I've watched his rise to stardom and many various stages of his life. He started out as a nightclub singer in the theaters way back many years ago, when he first went on an amateur contest. Today he's one of the big names in the business. So here he is, Herb Jeffries. [MUSIC - HERB JEFFRIES, "IN MY HEART (THERE'S A SONG)"] -(SINGING) In my heart there's a song, and it all belongs to you. In my heart there's a thing and a dream that you made true. Now I know I must confess to you in this life I'll never find one who has such loveliness as you. In this world, in this mind, in my heart there's a song, and it speaks of your love, of your lips, of your arms, of a love I've never known. Then it sings to me like a symphony. Then it ends and begins in my heart. In my heart there's a voice and it speaks of your love, of your lips, of your arms, of a love I've never known. Then it sings to me like a symphony. Then it ends and begins in my heart. [APPLAUSE] -Just a minute. Wait a minute, honey. I want-- -(SCREAMING) No! What is this? What is this? -Now, you don't go hollering, what is this? What is this? What does it look like? This is me. That's what it is. -Well. -This ain't the flying saucer. This is the sailing dishpan, honey. -Well, sail on, honey. -Oh, I'm me, and I'm just sailing all around, all over the place-- here, there. I'm sailing all over. -What's all this sailing about? -Well, you see I was in to see my doctor this morning. -Oh yeah? -Yeah. He looked me over, examined me real good. -Uh-huh. -Then he put me out the office. He says, man, go ahead get out right quick. Go ahead, pick up and enjoy yourself while you've got time. -Uh-huh. -So I'm just sailing 'round and picking up here, there, and every-- -Wait a minute, fella. Cool down. What did you pick up in California? -Well they wasn't putting down nothing in California. -You're telling me. -Yeah, but I picked up and left from there in a hurry. -I know all about it. -Ah, but wasn't I glad to get back to good, old New York. -Well, who wouldn't be? -Yeah, good, old New York. No sooner than I stepped off the plane there-- right in the station. There was a man standing right in the station selling five dollar bills for fifty cents. -How about that? -Yeah. -Well how could that fella do that? -How could he do it? They can do anything in New York to make a living. -Oh, they can? -They don't ask you how you got it. -No? -All they want to know is have you got it? [LAUGHTER] -And they waiting for you. You better bring it with you when you come here, too. -There must have been something phony about those bills. -Oh no, I wouldn't say they was phony? -No? -No, they was just seconds, that's all. -Seconds? -Yeah, well you see they made a misprint on the bill. -Uh-huh. -Yeah, you see they had Lincoln's head printed upside down on there. -So what? -His mustache was where his eyebrows should be. -No kidding? -He looks just like John L. Lewis from the factory. -Oh, what? -Yeah, but I'm going to get me a whole basket of full of them bills, and I'm going on back out West, and I'm going to do like the Doctor said-- pick up and have a good time while I got time. Well, what's wrong with you, Freddie? -I can't keep up with those nice, beautiful girls like I used to. You know-- doing that mambo and all that. -Oh, Freddy, I'm surprised at you worrying about the girls. -Well, I don't see nothing else in the world be learning. Yeah, I'm-- -Well, I'm here. -Yeah, I see you. There's nothing wrong with me. -I should say not. I should say not. You are-- oh my! -Don't you remember that old saying? -What old saying? -You know. They say a woman is like a street car. You miss one here, another one along any minute. -Oh, just like street cars. Just like-- yeah, but I'm scared by the time I get there, they'll all be going back to the car barn for repairs. -Oh, no. -Oh yeah. -Well, don't let that worry you. -No, I won't I mean, after all, you know-- you're all right. -Well, I hope I am. -Yes, indeed. I'm telling you. I'm honest as I can be-- -Well, what about your doctor? What did he tell you to do? -Well, he told me to go head on and enjoy myself, but I can't get back there. -Oh, you can't? -No. Well, you poor fellow. I really feel sorry for you. -Yeah, don't worry about nothing no more, huh? -I should say not. -Yeah. -Well, why don't you try doing the mambo? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yeah. -See how easy it is? -Si, si, senorita. Look at that. -Just, uh, follow me. -Oh, yes. That's real nice. Oh, I'm into it. -You got it all right, Mac? -I don't know. I think I am. -Don't I send you? -You send me all right, honey. But I'm scared I'm too week to take a trip. [APPLAUSE] Ladies and gentlemen, the next artist is one of the great names in the blues and rhythm field, although the tune he's going to play now is a real bouncy one. But it carries a very important message. And I want to listen to it. Here he is-- Amos Milburn. [APPLAUSE] [MUSIC - AMOS MILBURN, "BAD, BAD WHISKEY"] (SINGING) Bad, bad whiskey-- bad, bad whiskey-- bad, bad whiskey made me lose my happy home. When I left my home this morning I promised I would think to stay real straight and sober. I swore I wouldn't drink. Bad, bad whiskey-- bad, bad whiskey-- bad, bad whiskey made me lose my happy home. I passed up all the pool halls gave the boys the slip. Before the night was over, I started into sip bad, bad whiskey. Bad, bad whiskey-- bad, bad whiskey made me lose my happy home.

I still think I got tricked into my marriage still, Willie. -Hey, that brings something back to my mind. I heard a fantastic story. I wish you would enlighten me on it. -What's that? -Is it true that your little brother, when Freddie was courting you, slipped the minister down to the house, and he got down behind the sofa? -That's right. -Then the little brother came through the living room with his baseball suit on and a bat. -That's right. -And he said who likes the Dodgers? -I said, I do. -Then little boy said, who likes the Giants? -I said, I do. -And is it true that the minister jumped up from behind the sofa and said, I now pronounce you man and wife? -That's right. -Wonderful life, huh? -I'll always remember that. And another thing-- it hits me all the time-- is that what is this saying about the English language, or something. -Oh, you mean the English language being the mother tongue? -Yeah, yeah, that's it. It must be right. -Why? -Because father never gets the chance to use it. [LAUGHTER] -Good luck to you. Thank you. [INAUDIBLE] Thank you.

How come you can't pay me? -The races-- a low-down hound. -Hound? What kind of races do you play? -Horse races. -What track you play at? -I play over here-- -That track's crooked. Why don't you play over here around-- -That's where I lost my money. -Mm-hm. How much did you lose? -I lost about-- -You didn't have that much. -No? -No, all you had was-- -I had more than that. I bet on a horse, and that rascal didn't come in-- -Was he that far behind? -Yeah. -Who was the jockey riding him? -A jockey by the name of-- -He can't ride. Now I thought he went out there to ride for -- -He did. But they bought him. He came on back. -Oh, yeah? -Yeah, and do you know what he did? -What? -Let me tell you.

You take it easy. -All right. -Au revoir. -Farewell. That's why I like to talk to a man. We always understand each other. But let me tell you, I did go to the race track. Went to the racetrack, I had a roll big enough to choke a horse. That's what I should have done was choke that rascal instead of betting on him. I bet $15 on a horse's nose, found after the race I could have bought him for $10. I didn't mind him getting left at the polls. That could happen to any horse. But when he stops in front of the grandstand and asked me, which way did they go, that's when I gave up. And I thought I had a good horse. He left the post twenty to one. Came in at quarter after five. The horse ran so slow that the jockey actually felt guilty. He felt guilty. When he got in his dress, the jockey started giving the whip, you know? The horse stopped, looked back at the jockey, said, man, what are you hitting me for, there's nobody behind us. I left and walked around to a little place where they were serving drinks. All of a sudden a guy walks into the bar he had his handkerchief up to his next like this. He raps on the bar. The bartender comes over, says, what can I do for you? The guy says-- Bartender says, do you want a drink? Bartender said, don't I know you? So where you been, over to the racetrack? So you-- did you win? You bet? You lose? How much you lose? Bartender says, $2? The bartender said, $2,000? Bartender said, gee whiz, if I lost $2,000 on the races my wife would cut my throat.
