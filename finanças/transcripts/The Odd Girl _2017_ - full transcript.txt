Stick to the sides. No. Go back to the corners. - Are you gonna use the tub? - Yes. The kids have their own. - Once will be enough. - Of course. Come on, Celine. And back there, too. Walk along the couch. I can't stand that noise. Can you make it stop? What if she's a little late? Say, 10 minutes? She must not be late. Do you have the hours set by the judge? Yes. From 7:30 pm to 5:00 pm, every day. You must absolutely stick to it. Where do the stairs lead to? We have a terrace. THE ODD GIRL I've prepared you a bag. Take a look. I put in the things that could be useful. - Still nothing? - No. It'll come back. It has to. We're almost there. I have a meeting at 9. I have to drive the other way round. Look. There it is. - Drop me at the square. - Are you sure? I don't know if I can. Come on, hurry up. See you tonight. The five floors are identical: 30 rooms each. Laundry in the carts. How many times do I have to say it? This way, please. You must have some good connections. Management demanded that I hire you without even meeting you. I usually do at least one interview. Maybe you're exceptional. You come from Lisbon, right? Yes. I lived there for seven years. Ever worked in this business? I was in charge of groups. We used to work a lot with hotels. Reservations. The agency shut down due to the crisis. How dreadful. We will assign you a locker. You can leave your things here for today. Go ahead. I'll get you a blazer. I recommend that you wear a skirt. Guests like it. Nadia will explain to you how the front desk works. Don't forget to tie up your hair. And smile. Holiday Inn, Porte de Clichy, how can I help you? Yes. Please, hold. - Did you have a nice stay? - Yes. - Room number, please? - 53. Heloise, can I have the bill of room 53, please? So, two beers, one Coke and three phone calls, right? That's correct. Yes? Your payment is ready. - Thank you. Goodbye. - Goodbye. Yes. What date? Are you Heloise Landon? - Hello. I started this morning. - You're not on Facebook. No, I'm not. We'll be working together. I'm on trial, too. And there's only one vacancy. It's gonna be dog eat dog. Come on! - Want some more? - No, thank you. Oh. Please, come. - It's you... - Come in, honey. Can you make some room for her? I don't want to... - Go ahead, take a seat. - Thank you. - Her hair looks nice, Michel. - Yes, it looks nice. You're leaving? Don't you want dessert? I made your favorite pie. Hey! Agnes is talking to you. Clement, do you have homework? I wanted to thank you for what you did. I'm gonna do fine at the hotel. Why, certainly! - It was important for your mom. - Dad! Daddy! - What's wrong? - Eat. It's gonna get cold. No! I don't want to! No! - I don't want to! - I'll be right back. Stop it, please. I can't believe this. Where did I put it? - You have another set of keys? - I do, but I'd like to find my bag. I got it! It's right here! We'll figure something out. - OK, Celine, let's go. - Heloise. Heloise. Sorry. CUSTOMER AREA SMILE - Good morning. - Morning. No breakfast after 10:30. Union's orders. You'll do anything, huh? Anything to please Ruiz. So, Mr. Lancret on the 26th. One room for two, two nights, breakfast included. Yes. Yes, absolutely. Do you have a customer card number? You don't? Can I have your credit card number then, please? Yes. Very well. Thank you. Goodbye. He had a good profile, but... He could be a tool. Well, I was wrong. He was a nice guy. Tall, big smile... And he was quite smart, too. And that body... a real stud. He'll do the trick for this week. What about you? You're married, right? What does your hubby do? - He's a History teacher. - Oh, he's a teacher? The nerdy kind, with a side part? You had a crumb. Come on, leave her alone now. We have the right to know. Tell us. Do you have a pic of him? Can we see him? You don't want to show me? Why isn't she answering? - Maybe we're not... - Shut up, OK? Both of you, that's enough now. We should go. Ruiz is gonna be pissed. Have a coffee, take your time. OK? Come on. Watch out, girls. She's upset. No one knows your real identity? No. The hotel management is covering me. You filed a petition to change your name? My lawyer submitted it at the gazette. The file is ready. But the deadlines are very long. And I doubt you'll get it. The philosophy of law never erases the criminal past. How is it going at work? A little tense. You have to earn your place. Just remember - no job, no parole. I'm doing fine. Getting used to your bracelet? I don't know if I'll hold out three months. You'll do just fine. Open the door. Thank you. I'm sorry, I was locked out. I hope I didn't wake you up. Goodnight. Hello? Yes. Sure she is. She's coming. Yeah, I know. I can see you. Well, hurry up. He's right there. Hi. - Heloise. - Idir. Here comes Bruno. Making a call while on crutches is quite a tough feat, let me tell you. - I'm Bruno. - Hello. Heloise. - Nice to meet you. - Are we going? I'll take the backseat. This leg of mine... OK, are you getting in? I got into carpooling because of my leg. It's just perfect. It's cheap, it's green. Sometimes it's even fun. A car is 12% of a household budget, and 70 % of all commuting trips, with only one passengers in 80 % of the cases. I mean, it's awful. We are the epitome of shared consumption. What do you do? You always want to know when you meet someone. I'm an IT engineer specializing in statistics. What about you? I'm a receptionist in a hotel. Lucky lady. God, I love hotels. There are funny stories in hotels, right? - How long have you done that? - A few days. I used to live in Lisbon. Lisboa? I've been there. It's beautiful. I cried listening to fado in a small bar in Barrio Alto. I really cried. It's heartbreaking, don't you think? Yeah, it's true. See you tomorrow. Room service. - Hello. - Hello. - Breakfast. - Certainly not this week. We do blood work and that's it. No need for more. Why? No. I discussed that with Marie. I'll see you next week, and we'll debrief with everyone later. Have a nice day. Of course. I'd like to pay. Was everything OK? My neighbors were quite loud. - I couldn't sleep. - We can always step in. Next time, sir, please let us know. And what will you tell them? "Please, stop fucking"? Goodbye. Hello... Heloise. Hello. - Heloise suites you really well. - Excuse me? You're as beautiful as ever. You haven't changed, Heloise. I'm happy to find you, at last. You're mistaking me for someone else. I'm Pierre Vitrac. Do you remember me? You wrote to me. - We corresponded. - I don't know you. Please, don't play that game. We both know, don't we? Would you like a room? No room, thank you. But I'll come back to see you. See you soon. You've got a fan. Who is he? I don't know. Some creep. Don't worry. They all get tired eventually. That's right, yes. So, two nights. Dear Celine Klein, I saw you on the newspapers and your face struck me. I've followed your trial. They say you're a criminal, but I know that your actions were necessary and inevitable. With courage and composure, you did justice to human dignity. And that noxious jury will not make me think otherwise. More than once did I surprise your silent tears. They overwhelmed me. If I can help you in any way, feel free to write me. I will always be there. Thinking about you every day, Pierre Vitrac. - When did you meet? - Ten years ago. Holy cow! Ten years with the same guy? - Don't you want to change? - For an IT guy? I mean, ten years in insane! It's rare, nowadays. - Where did you two meet? - In a car. He was in the backseat. He talked all the time. I thought he was irresistible. Give me a break, doc. Oh, no! Not that! Well, I like it. For Christ's sake, no! Slow dance was the only dance I knew. Classic or erotic? There're two schools, you know. Classic: you put your hands on your partner's shoulders. And then you go on. Classic style. Erotic: you place only one hand at first, and the second hand afterwards, so you can stroke her body. You are allowed to do that. Anyway, that was a long time ago. I'd be rather classic, then. Me too. Yeah, well, I was the king of erotic slow dance. God knows I hooked up! - Bye. - See you tomorrow. - I've just seen something crazy. - What? - She's wearing a bracelet. - Huh? It's in her ankle. I swear. She must have done something really bad. You're imagining things. Flore calls him "the owl". He was looking at me. Got a light, please? - Here. - Thank you. - You're preparing your exams, right? - Yeah. I think I'm gonna do fine. What will you do afterwards? I've no idea. My mother says you're a very good student. That's pushing it. Do you and my mother get along? - Does she nag you? - Not really. She's pretty cool. I like her a lot. Yeah, I know I woke you up. Well, as soon as you get there. Call me. OK, I love you. See you later. I didn't know you had a daughter. You don't know everything. You can never truly know a person, their secrets. Don't you think, Heloise? Surely. At the same time, it might be better like that. Sometimes it's better not to know. - Bye. - See you tomorrow. All that was uncalled for. - I found it. - What? Her name's not Heloise. That girl is Celine Klein. Remember her? She was a real night bird. Always high and screwing around. You know the type? She killed that banker, Luc Anriot. The guy was stabbed twice in the back. I mean, can you believe it? It's not her. You can see it is her. It's amazing we actually came across this girl. So, what do we do? We'll change them to room 324. So, it's two nights... - Room 104. Have a nice stay. - Thank you. The management called. They asked me how things were with you. I told them it was quite alright. Why keep the pants, though? I asked you to wear a skirt. - I have a hole in my leg. - You're making it up. Nadia, at your service. - Good morning. - Good morning. We won't wait for Bruno? He's not coming anymore. Actually, he got his splint off. - Wasn't it at the end of the month? - No idea. Will you come anyway? Sure, why wouldn't I? We'll go 50-50. I can change it. Whatever you want. I like it. How old is your daughter? Asma? She's 16. I'm quite lucky because... we both get along really well. Except when she was 13. Things got complicated. She was... Anyway, I had no idea what was going on. We didn't speak the same language. She gave me a hard time. But now we're doing better. Different problems. I see what you mean. - Do you have children? - Not yet. But I was that age, too. It's locked. Wait. Thank you. - See you tomorrow. - Bye. Minus expenses and reimbursements... there won't be much left. Only 450 euros a month. I don't spend any money. So the first transfer was made on the 4th of this month. The total amount you owe the widow of the victim and her two children... Ah, yes - 143,000 euros. Well, it's a start, isn't it? The hotel asked me if I could work nights. I don't think that'd be a problem. We'll adjust the timetable. Night shifts can be hard. Day shifts are hard, too. Yes. I guess it'll be quieter at night. Sign here, please. We're at Michel's sister. We'll be back at around 10. Your dinner's in the microwave. Mom - Did I scare you? - No, no. - Got a light? - Yeah. I'm sick to the back teeth. My father's a pain. "You need to graduate with honors..." He pushes me because he failed at school. I think you're lucky. My father didn't even know when I'd sit my exams. He forgot. Did he visit you when you were there? In jail? Yeah, a few times, at first. We were never really close. And then, after his accident, I asked for permission to go to his funeral. They didn't grant it. My poor father. We missed one another. That's the way it is. Is the bracelet uncomfortable? It's hell. I feel like I have a cop next to me all the time. By the way, I'll be working nights as of the 24th. So I won't be commuting with you anymore. Really? I'll pay you the rest of the month. No, you don't have to. I might stop, then. Carpooling is fine, but... you never know who you're gonna run into. I mean... Suppose it's a grumpy old man that whines all the time. No, it's for sure. After you... I'm done. There might be another way, though. I could do nights at the hospital. That way, we would... We would drive to Paris... in the evening. It'd be nice, but... There's my daughter. Celine. - What are you doing here? - Watching out for you. I miss you. I wanted to check in with you. How are you doing? - I can't talk. - You surely have a minute. I came here for you. I've come a long way. Wait there. I'll be back. - In the lounge? - Yes. - Be right back. - I'll be waiting. I'm taking up your working time. I'm sorry. But I wanted to see you. I can't help it. Look, I don't owe you anything. I replied to your first letter. I thanked you and asked you not to write me again. I didn't read the others. I'd like to forget my past. Do not interfere. I just want to help you. The outside world is dangerous. Men are beasts greedy for sex and money... Predators. That's their nature. They will hurt you again. What do you do for a living? No, no. Yes. Answer me. I know nothing about you, it's not fair. Do you have a job, a family? I don't talk about me. - You won't lack anything. - I don't need your help. I don't need you. Leave me alone! Very well. I won't come back. But I'll have to see you. From time to time. Wherever you like. Here's my card. Call me, OK? See you soon, Celine. Hello? Yes, I'm almost at the square. I'm right there. Yes. Well, I don't. Where? At the lights? I don't see you. I'm telling you, I don't see you. Good grief. No, I don't know where... Ah, there you are. I can see you now. Excuse me. Won't your boyfriend say hi? Now's not the time. Hello. Don't you ever do that again, do you hear me? It's OK, don't be dramatic. I'm here now. No, it is not OK, and yes, I'll be dramatic. Don't you realize? I was worried sick. "I won't be coming home tonight". It's not that hard! Phone ran out of power. His roommate gave me a charger. - Your friend has no phone? - I don't know your number. Well, you should. You're being such a pain. I'm sorry I put you through this. Don't worry, it's OK. Here you go. Your payment is ready. - Perfect. - See you soon. Bye. Ruiz asked me to stay near the conference. I didn't have time to check the 6th floor. She could go. Unless she's too busy. You're pushing it. You could've told me before. Can you go see if the rooms are ready? The group will be here in 30 minutes. Rush the girls. I have a briefing in 5 minutes. Go. I'll tell Ruiz. It won't take you long. Room service. I'm sorry, I fell asleep. Where are we? Actually, I decided to drive you to your hotel. Are you mad at me? You'll be late. Not at all. I'm not working today. Plus, this is our last trip, Miss. And it's my pleasure. Porte de Clichy, right? Can I call you Heloise? If you want. Wouldn't it be easier for you to live in Paris? I mean, wouldn't it be easier, Heloise? I would love that. I'd like to enjoy the city a little more. I had some bad habits in Portugal. I used to go out a lot. There're improvised bars at night. It's very cheerful. You feel free. Have you been to Lisbon? No. But I would like to go there. Do you have plans for tonight? I'm asking because... I'm invited to my birthday party, so... I would be really happy if you could come. I can't. I'm sorry. OK... At least I tried. It's alright. - Thank you very much. - My pleasure. See you soon, maybe. Yes. I mean, I hope so. Bye. - Can we talk? - Can't it wait? About my schedule, I was wondering if I could come at 8:30 on Saturday and leave 30 minutes later? You know, the bus. We'll talk about it tomorrow. But, in theory, would you be OK with it? I need to know right now because of the buses. Look, Heloise, we'll discuss this later, OK? It's a last-minute replacement. I didn't have a choice. Well, I would say I'll probably be home no later than half past midnight. Yes, exceptionally. What's the address for tonight? - Hi. - Is this Idir's party? That's right. Come on in. - This way, please. - Good evening. Idir. - Hi. - Hi. - Alright? - Yes. Want something to drink? Champagne, wine or something stronger? - Champagne. - Very well. Here. It's for you. You shouldn't have. People are given presents on their birthday. Yeah, it's true. Thank you. I'll open it, then. "Greatest Slow Songs Volume 1". Thank you. - We should play it. - You don't have to. It's nice that you're here. - Care for a dance? - No. Wait, wait. It's my birthday. You can't say no. Excuse me. Thank you. Can I kiss you again? - Are you alright? - Yes. I've had too much alcohol. You made a mistake? No, that's not what I meant. - Where's Idir? - Idir? Idir! They're such a pain. Are you coming? In a second. I'll be right back. Hello? Yes? - She's coming. - Yes, she's here. She's here, she's home. Yes, that's it. It stopped. Thank you, sir. Seen the time? It's been ringing. Where were you? - Do you have money? - What? Money. It's for the taxi. The guy's waiting outside. Quick. They'll report this. That's what they said. What can I do? I was at work. I'll tell them. I can't go. Mom? He's got my bag. Can you take it, please? I'll call you soon. I felt good in your arms. H. Why did you leave? Please, tell me. - You're not sleeping? - No. Is everything OK? Yeah. You were at a friend's, right? That's correct. How do you know? You've got lipstick in your mouth. Shit. - So? - What? - Well, what is she like? - What do you mean? - Come on, tell me about her. - Quiet. Well... She's wicked, you see? She's wicked. She goes super fast. Everything I think of, she's already thought about. Everything's going real fast. I love it. We'll see if it lasts. Everybody hits on her. It's hell. I have to fight. You're in love. It doesn't happen very often. Why? I think a person can be in love like 10 times. Even 20 times in a lifetime. Don't you think? I don't know. I don't think I've ever really been in love. Except maybe when I was 12. I never kissed the boy. We didn't even talk. Maybe you could find him. Yeah, but I don't know his name. Yes? Yes, no problem. - One night, isn't it? - Yes. Thank you. See you tonight. Bye. Will you come? I'll introduce you to my son. Alright. That'll be nice. Have a smoke, take your time. There's not a soul. Hi, this is Idir. I have a new passenger in my car. A real estate agent. He's always talking about properties. It's a nightmare. I miss you. I hope I see you soon. Yes? Where are you? OK, I'm on my way. Yes, don't worry. Yes. Yes, Mom. Alright, see you in a bit. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to go. She locked herself out. She's not all there. Maybe a neighbor can help her in. The neighbors are sick and tired of her. She's alone. I'm all she's got. Ethan, honey? Ethan, we're going to Grandma's. I don't want to. - Ethan! - No! I don't want to go. Where does she live? Twenty minutes from here. If you hurry, I'll stay with Ethan. No, that's OK. I can manage. I'm used to it. Go ahead. I can stay. Nadia, I'm sorry but I gotta go. Call me back as quickly as possible. Thanks. Here. Careful, it's hot. Listen, I have to go, OK? Be good. You stay right here. Alright? Hello? I'm sorry, I... I didn't have a choice. I told you I couldn't stay. I'm sorry, Nadia. Is Ethan OK? Nadia? Nadia? Heloise, it's me again. I... Idir here. Why are you ignoring my messages? You've been gone for weeks, and... I don't know what to do. Good evening. I hope you're OK. If want me to go away, let me know. - Hello. - Hello. Wait. There's something I have to tell you. I'm on parole. I have home detention schedules I must keep to. Or I'll be back in jail. Are you messing around with me? - What is it? - An ankle monitor. That's why I had to leave your son. What did you do? I killed a man. A man who raped me. My name is Celine, not Heloise. No one knows. So please, keep it to yourself. - Hi. - Hi. You are unusual. There you go. Your electronic surveillance is over. You will remain on parole for the next two months. Keep up the good behavior and everything will be fine. Thank you. Hi. Have a nice day, sir. Goodbye. See? Your legs are just fine. You're my daughter. I can accommodate you. Nadia works day shifts, I do nights. We'll share the room. It'll be easier for everyone. You just leave without warning. It wasn't that bad. I'm worried you might need something. I'm proud of you, you know? I wonder why you would. Hey... Mom. Idir? - Sorry I'm late. - It's OK. You're here. That's what matters. - How are you? - I'm fine. You? I'm alright. Would you like to go for a walk? I was surprised at your phone call. I was happy to hear you. I wish I'd called you sooner, but I was very busy. I understand. Children born in hard circumstances are given this name as encouragement. I've always needed encouragement. You're a Kabyle? My parents are. They grew up there before coming to France. After my father died, my mom went back to her mountains. But I was born here. I'm 100 % Parisian. Heloise is a German name. It means... Solid wood. It suits you. How's your daughter? She's fine. She's a little rough with her father, but.... That's OK. She asked me about you. She wanted to know more. What did you tell her? I told her... nothing at all. I mean, yeah, I... I said you got in my car quite a lot, and that I was your... I had been your official driver. I feel like traveling. Where to? I'd like to go to Lisbon. Or rather, go back there. My best friend lives there. You're leaving? I'm gonna be sad. I want to be with you. I want to take care of you. I'm gonna need some time for that. I know what happened. I know who you are. What're you talking about? I know. How long have you known? It doesn't change a thing. You have to trust me. How long have you known? Answer me. I don't care what you did or who you were. What matters is that you and I met. I don't care about the rest. Why say this now? You wanted to see how far this'd go? Is it exciting to screw a girl like me? - No. - You want to heal me? - No, I don't. Hey... - Get off me! I like you. I don't care about the rest, OK? I just want to be with you. - Alright? - Don't touch me. I don't want to see you again. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Front desk. Room service. Ah, there you are. I was waiting for you. You can come in. You will never change. Things were clear, though. I thought you would call. But you didn't. You didn't keep your promise. So I got worried. You still don't know how you feel about me. But I don't blame you. In due time, you will see. Would you like a drink? Scotch. Dry? Come and sit down. Here. Right next to me. How should I call you? Celine... Heloise? Celine. I like it better. That's a pretty skirt. It makes you look good. I didn't know you had such beautiful legs. How could I? There are so many things I don't know about you. And I want to know. You know how much I love you. - I like you. - No... - Be quiet! - No! You are mine. You belong to me. Hello, you have reached Agnes Klein. Leave a message and I'll get back to you. We're here. As you can see, there's nothing. Is this the room? Tell us what happened. There. I... I struggled. I pushed him back. He hit his head here, and he ended up on the floor. He wasn't moving. He wasn't moving. The room was made at 10:45 a. m., and the cleaning service had nothing to report. Did you see this man? No. I didn't check him out. But you can ask my workmate. Just a second. Yes? Yes, we're here. I'll call you back. Thanks. We have found Mr. Vitrac. He says he's never been to this hotel. I don't know what to say. What do you think? I don't know. Don't worry, I'll take care of Ruiz. I'm scared he'll come back. Who? That man? He'll have to deal with me. Mrs. Cruz? Your file is stored. You're gonna have to wait. What sort of dizziness? My head hurts, I feel sick. Has it happened before? Not like this. - Are you on treatment? - No. Vomiting? Are you pregnant? - No, no. - OK. A doctor will see you. I'm gonna need your name and your SS number. Ms. Klein? - Yes. - Follow me, please. - I'll see you tomorrow at 10. - 9 a. m. See you tomorrow. - Here. - Thank you. So, Ms. Klein... Hello. You... You've been feeling dizzy. Is that right? I lose balance. I pass out, I fall down. Does it happen often? Quite often. When I experience a shock or a strong emotion. What kind of shock? Like a... romantic shock for example. Sit down. We don't want you to faint. - Did that happen recently? - Yes. I thought I was being manipulated, but I was to blame. It wasn't his fault. Very well. Do you have a professional activity? I work in a hotel, but I'm not sure I'll stay. Next week, I'll be totally free. Can I make a confession? Go ahead. I thought I was weak. Maybe I'm stronger than I thought. But I don't know if I will make it. Everything's too big for me. I'm scared. I'm scared to death. I know someone who could help me. You know, the... Dizziness is often due to a disruption of the inner ear. It's harmless. No, it's not harmless. I think I'm in love. Subtitles: ECLAIR
