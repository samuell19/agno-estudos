Five minutes. Five minutes, yes. You're on tour, mostly with old songs. Haven't recorded for a while. Might you be recording new songs soon? I'd say yes. I've already made a new a-ha record. If we'd gone somewhere for three months to make a record. Locked up and released after three months, then I might have been a believer. -No. -You don't want to record anything new? -No. -Why not? Because it's a hornets nest. In the end we just wanna bash each other's brains out. After school there would be a few hours before my parents came from work, and it would be stereo on, absolutely cranked. Anything you liked, you liked it because you saw yourself in that part, that band. That was the big escape. My father was a musician and audio technician at NRK. Trumpets in the front was the big thing in Norway at the time. I remember how my father used to practice with his foot on a stool. There were always instruments around. So I'd sit down with an instrument. Try to find something. Combine sounds. It's probably the first image I have of something... Something I felt an attraction to. Four years old, I tried out the piano. Started making songs right away. Suddenly mom comes over to me with slightly forced enthusiasm. I could tell immediately. She thought it sounded "nice". Said I was going to get a piano teacher. That was a huge mistake. I remember riding in the car, five years old, leaning towards the driver's seat. Singing a typical Norwegian song about spring. A song with a very wide tonal range. Suddenly I discovered I had wings. I had wings on which to sing. It was just a wonderful feeling. Yes, sir. -Really? Do I need the jacket? -No. Alright. I've got it. I didn't listen to other people. I had my own, critical voice that drowned out everything else. That's still how I am. I listen to other people, but every time someone tries to give me advice... Nobody has ever offered me any sensible, practical advice about singing. I'm extremely hard on myself. It's absolutely devastating. But there's another concert the day after tomorrow. And so on. As long as there are concerts left, I can never let my guard down. Heading home from school I heard noise from a balcony. It was the first time I actually noticed Pal. His friend had an organ, and Pal played on drums made from cardboard rolls with some iffy plastic drumheads on. Playing a concert for whoever passed by. Even though Magne only lived literally 50 yards down the road, I didn't see him until we were 13. Only when I heard he had an amplifier, we got a bit curious about each other. Pal and I had a very parallel musical awakening. We started digging through music history. Discovered the 60's. A cousin of mine went to London. He returned with an album by Uriah Heep. The sound was awesome. Musical expression way beyond anything I'd heard before. I started singing Freddie Mercury stuff. So he's certainly been an important inspiration, something to strive for. Pal and I raced to get the most Jimi Hendrix records. Think I had 23. Certain bands can amaze you, but you can't copy them. You don't have the same skills. You can listen to the Beatles and so on. It's too perfect to be really inspired by. So when you get to Velvet Underground and Joy Division, "Ah, I can do that." I remember us lying on the grass, talking about the future. Our bikes lying on the ground beside us. I said, "When I grow up, I'm gonna be a musician." Pal later talked about it as a moment where he... To him it was a radical thought. His parents were more focused on education. I was lucky because everyone around me thought of music as something you took seriously. We were only fifteen. I noticed Magne from day one. He'd brought a huge Jimi Hendrix poster. Hung it up in the back of the classroom. He was very charming, funny and completely unafraid. He played in a band. Pretty soon he wanted everyone to hear it. This need to show and share has always been there. I think the very first show we did was me on drums, him on guitar. We played in his classroom. That was our big first opening. Which was great, cause every time I hit a drum solo, the girls screamed. I was like, "Yes, we've arrived!" I sang and played guitar more or less until my voice broke. We tried with two guitars for a while. But I felt that it didn't really gel. And then I came up with the great idea that he should change to keyboards. Well, it was traumatic. I was a guitar player. It felt... pretty lousy. But I was right. He took to it like fish to water. After a couple of rehearsals he came up with much more stuff than he had on the guitar. Well, it didn't feel like fish to water. I felt that I bent to his will. Because taking the fight would be painful on some level. And it didn't come easy. I had to change my mindset. Being a keyboard player was never my dream. But that was the result, and we made it work. Alright, shall we try playing it through? Magne sort of felt like Pal was his big brother. He wanted to impress Pal. He looked up to Pal, both because he was, and still is, a bit older. But also because of Pal's gift as a songwriter. Magne and Pal's relationship was always very competitive, but also very productive. We were very close at the time. Pal and I were very much in tune with each other, often. Bridges got started when Viggo Bondi and Qystein Jevanord became part of the story. We started to get ambitions. This would be the band. I was electrified the first time I heard Pal and Magne's band. Everything was there. They needed a singer. I knew they had to discover me. I had discovered them. I had to wait for them to discover me. They came to listen to me at Club 7. They just sat there. I remember how they sat there, just "attending". I'd heard about Morten Harket. Heard that he had a very good voice. We were impressed, contacted him. Magne and I were going the same way home. Pal was going to Manglerud. We got on a train, but for some reason we had to walk part of the way. -It was late in the evening. -It was a long walk. We talked a lot about music. Started to talk about our families. His biological father, his birth father, had died in a plane crash outside Drammen. "Outside Drammen? When was that? How old were you?" "I was there, saw that plane go down." The crash is now being investigated. The plane was heading for Link√©ping, where Bent Sglve's orchestra was to hold a concert. My brother was sitting by the window. He spotted the Cessna. "I think it's in trouble. They're going down!" My father sees it too. He turns the car around, follows the plane. We're close by when it happens. And Magne's father is among those killed in the crash. So there was like... A strong sense of destiny the first time we met. Then he walks home in the night. I go home. And I don't know if I'll ever talk to him again. We were really backward at the time. You had to be there to understand. Nothing had started yet. We were the outskirts. Norway has always been dominated by dancehall bands. It's time Norwegian pop and rock bands get the chance to shine. Nobody had had any significant international breakthrough. And it wasn't just pop music. Norway was still in a post-war state. Hadn't begun to export football players or anything else. How can we get out of Norway? How can we not have to compete with music that we didn't see any sort of relation to. There's nothing here that we listen to. We were only 15-16 years old when the local newspaper interviewed us. "We're gonna be international pop stars. Norway's too small for us." He just wanted to get through high school so he could go to London and make a living from music. Nobody believed him. Nobody had done it before. But Pal and I were the only ones who really believed in that dream. Magne called. "The two others are staying here, Pal and I are going to England." "You wanna come with us?" "No, I made a deal with Arild. We're going interrailing." I said I couldn't join them until after summer. They left, thinking I didn't wanna come. Don't know why they misunderstood me. To this day I still don't know what they thought I meant. We went over, were planning to start a band once we got there. We were serious. No turning back. We wouldn't return until we were stars. The first thing we did when we got there, was put in ads in Melody Maker and NME. We were looking for a harp player. There hadn't been a front harpist in pop before. But we actually found a guy who played electric harp. We went to a lot of the sort of Camden clubs, saw a lot of cool bands. We discovered Soft Cell, which I think was a big influence on us. Mainly the first six months, we were soaking in, like a learning process. Tried to ease my guilt from not doing any university that my parents wanted. We were in a bedsit in London, hoping to show others our songs. Pal whistling and playing guitar while I played synth. Everyone who had any sense could see that this was going nowhere. We had to do something. I said we should go home, get Morten to join the band. I convinced the band to not return to England at once, but stay in Norway. To use Norway for the rest of the year. We all had parents we could stay with. It was the first time I'd talked sense into someone. I was like the oldest. "This is how we have to do it." The only reason not to was Pal's huge embarrassment at coming home without having made it. Music is saying things that can't be said in a sentence. There's no way you can pinpoint that song, get that vibe in a couple of lines. I would get obsessed with one thing, it would be all about that, and nothing else matters. First it was all painting, but then I got sidetracked into music and it took over. My parents were very unhappy that I was dating this out-of-work musician. They thought that was terrible. I didn't think they'd make it. But Pal was so driven. He's like this horse. These horses where they put the blinders on so they can't see. He had those on. He could only see two things in his life. One of them, strongly, was music. And the other was me. It sounded like crap at first. It didn't sound promising, to be polite. It didn't have anything we wanted. Character. Individuality. Identity. Charm. Nada. But we held on to the dream about... That London was the place to be. We had to go there. We're listening to the radio, watching every pop show on TV. And got a bit scared. A lot of them were very together. They looked like stars. We could see that Morten looked great. He had what a lead singer needed. Had a great voice, was a poser with attitude. Morten constantly promoted the band. He'd refine his image. Changed his image almost from one day to the next. A lot of stash. I was the least stashed up, the most boring guy. Morten was way over the top. Used house paint in his hair when he ran out of hairspray. Played around with his own image a lot, ours too. He gave Pal a pretty dramatic makeover. He really dug in. Stripped him, dressed him and put on make-up. I was bowled over by their enthusiasm. I hadn't heard a note, hadn't heard a song, anything, but... They were very different to a lot of the clients that we'd been having from the punk era. We booked Rendezvous Studios from John Ratcliff with the money we had left. He was the first one who had enough faith in us to put his money where his mouth was. I really wanted to be involved. I could see the potential of the songwriting. The way Mags came up with so many great tunes and great melodies in addition to the songwriting of Pal. Morten's voice on the top was the icing on the cake. After a while John got in touch with Terry Slater, who'd been with EMI. He wanted to show him who we were. He'd signed up everyone from Queen to Sex Pistols, and he had a very sort of old-school ear for tunes, that I responded to. Back then getting a recording deal was the eye of the needle. And Terry only told us the good news. So we thought, "Why are we at this point?" Things were happening around the corner. "You'll be so busy you'll miss this time." So we were just sitting there hoping. "When are we gonna get busy?" You need real balls to get through it. To keep believing. Because most people don't. Don't want to believe. There were setbacks all the time. But in letters and phone calls to home, it was always about new opportunities opening up. If we landed a meeting with some completely insignificant person, it was painted as, "This is the big break!" We didn't have a plan B. Because plan B... You've already started doubting plan A. We must have spent at least two years thinking... "Okay, that didn't work. Remember that thing next week." "Meeting this person. He knows Elton John." We could see it in the way we lived. Started in Linden Gardens, in Notting Hill Gate, then it was Willesden Green. We took a step down each time we moved. Not because we didn't like the wallpaper. We needed a place without wallpaper! We lived below the poverty line for a while because we could, because we wanted to, because we felt we had to. I mean, we had our moments with porridge. I don't think we even thought about it. We couldn't ask for more money. So we lied. We went to Decca. They turned us down. And we celebrated since they'd turned down The Beatles too. I think it got sent to three, four or five record companies. Part of it was acting like more people were interested than was the case. I think Warner Brothers were the only ones who believed in it. The time after signing the contract was frustrating. We made little progress. The thing that took much longer than getting a deal, was getting that producer. You know, we had a hard enough time figuring out what a producer did. We ended up with Tony Mansfield. He changed everything. But he did really cool stuff. He was a genius with computers. Absolutely mind-blowing. It was cool. I wrote the riff on Take On Me at the age of 14-15 years. Pal responded negatively. It sounded "too commercial". Called it The Juicy Fruit Song because it reminded us of the commercial. It took many different shapes. We had a version of Take On Me with like rooster-crowing in the middle of it. We thought it was brilliant. In hindsight maybe it wasn't what put us on the map. Coming to London, that's when I really started to hate that chorus. I think Terry said it. He'd worked with Queen. "If you have a falsetto, it's a hit." And Morten had a wonderful falsetto. So I thought that could be a cool thing. Just to show off his range a bit. Every song you have a verse, then you want to hit that money note. I thought it would be cool to instead just start at the lowest note you can hit and build your way up from there. They mostly stay in England, the group that's become famous before releasing a single song. You think you can become superstars with some help from your record company and manager? -Yeah. Tony Mansfield changed much of what we were. I end up standing there all alone, hips, shoulders, blue eyes. I think they were worried we'd alienate the female members of the audience. They tried to make us look a little extra macho. Three terrified teenagers with loads of semi-naked women bouncing about. It came to a head with a version of Take On Me that we feel isn't there. Had we just wasted the opportunity, like? We'd used up all our money. Interest in the project was already waning. The record company was about to give up. But there was a strong feeling in the band that we could do it much better. And ended up in studio with Alan Tarney. A-ha's original demo of Take On Me was the right approach. So I just recreated that in the best way I possibly could. We finished Take On Me in one day. And cause I was so busy with other things, I didn't think what would happen to it. It was just another record. That was that. I was the one who fought for that song in the band. I was the one who really believed in it. "This is a worldwide hit." And I'd never thought like that. Never thought, "Do we have a hit?" I took the tape to the record company, all alone. Played it. "This is how it has to be." And our luck was that they'd just hired a guy called Jeff Ayeroff. I thought, "This isn't normal rock & roll or pop music. This is something else." A kind of synchronicity happens. I have this animator in the back of my head. "Here's this band. Kind of interesting. Who do I trust who's done videos for me," "has a fertile mind and can technologically deal with this?" "Steve Barron." I met the guys, sat down and talked about the concept. I remember they were put in some tiny little hostel. Even though massive amounts were being spent on the video. I remember thinking, even telling Morten, "You'll look back at this, and think..." "We were in that little place." "If it worked out, we'd never be in a place like that again." I remember one time we went to Venice Beach. Then you really got the feeling. You'd walk down that beach and hear the song. Like from one transistor radio to another. No matter what channel you went to, it would be there. Late yesterday evening, the Norwegian pop band a-ha reached the top of the pop chart in the US. First one of the top records in the world at the moment. No. 1 in five countries. No. 2 in Britain. A-ha, Take On Me! To the best of my knowledge, the first Norwegian group to make it big worldwide. We want a-ha! A-ha, Take On Me. A-ha! Manhattan, the heart of NYC. Their schedule is packed, but we get to meet two of them. -Today you're in New York. And tomorrow? -In Los Angeles. And then go on a world tour? We'll pop by Norway before going to England, then Australia and Japan. Suddenly we were going to Australia, with thousands of people at the airport at 3 a.m. We had no idea that would happen. In Japan, they had security on every floor. I was singled out from the band by the media. Flung out on my own. Had to stand in a cascade that never ended. That I had to relate to. We're not a band for the press. So I did very little band-related stuff for a long time. Because there was nothing but this eternal crescendo of noise. Glasses? Jacket? -Beautiful. -Thank you. Can I have a picture together? Okay, thank you. Danke schon. Danke sehr. Here comes Sebastian's... Remedy. One of the defences against... The flu for example. This is... My cocoon when we're on the road. I like it a lot better than flying. It's the only quiet place. It's vital to me. And all creatures, people and animals, spend a lot of time on restitution, finding a private corner where they can prepare to step out again. To be yourself. The way you feel you're composed. You don't have many sanctuaries when everyone knows who you are. They're gone. That's when a cocoon like this becomes essential. Yes. Here we go. -Four of them. -Four innocent victims. -Hello. -Hi. -Hello. -Hi. How are you? -My name... is Alexandra. -Alexandra? I wish you a pleasant stay in Berlin. Thank you. -I'm a huge fan of you guys. -Yeah. -Are you sure? -Yes! I have presents for you. From my home town, Potsdam. It's near Berlin. It's very near, Potsdam. -It's for you. -I got a heavier... -I wonder what that means. -Like with our hotel rooms. He gets the big one, I get the middle one, Pal gets the small one. The story of our life. I think they view me as the least intellectual. I get a big book to work on. In many ways it was comfy that Morten got the attention. Because Pal and I didn't really crave the sort of attention that Morten got. For me that was a heaven-send. Cause I was... Social angst up to eleven. So for me... The more they could take, that was a good thing for me. I didn't have a lot of ambitions in that direction. That wasn't my medium. That's not where I could show people what I could do. My first concert was Echo & the Bunnymen. And they stood the whole show with their back against the audience. I thought it was fantastic. I should've been in one of those bands. But I ended up in one of the most visible. Driven by videos and looks and everything. I got that part I never thought I would. I thought I'd be in the dark with a flashing light, doing moody songs. It took me about 25 years to figure out. "How do I handle all this stuff?" I'm very thinly skinned on a lot of things. I never feel I can sort of relax. It's almost like my brain... It's... I move myself out of the thing. If I'm doing an interview, I'm sitting there watching myself, wondering what stupid things I'm gonna do next. I can't be in the moment. It's tiring, you know. On Scoundrel Days, we had a unique production situation. We were on tour while demos and so on were being made. So we did a lot on our own in different studios around the world. Worked during soundchecks, in hotel rooms... We wanted a darker hue on this album. And also a bit more ambitious of what you put together. We had Manhattan Skyline, two songs put together. Same thing with Scoundrel Days. October, which was a different colour. There were a lot of ideas happening. Too many, in a way. So it wasn't so clear-cut who was in charge. It wasn't me. It wasn't them, necessarily. It was give and take. So it wasn't so easy musically to arrive at a finished recording. Uh... Just one thing. "You're hissing your s's like a snake." -Remember the tune? -No. Maybe it's better to leave that part until the next verse? That was a thing with Lauren. She was shocked when I took her to the studio. And I was the biggest pain in the ass, bossy guy, leaning over everybody's shoulder. If I hear something in my head that I'm trying to get, I have super-confidence. Especially Pal, he wanted to go down in the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, become a legend in the music business. And he was capable of it. Nothing would stop him. A-ha gave him the opportunity to make these records that he wanted to make. He was very powerful in the studio. Tremendous presence in the studio, musically. So he was, I suppose, dictating more than anyone else the direction of a-ha. The way we worked, you had to have a lot worked out beforehand. Because it wasn't like a band on the floor. You had to work it out before you started, or the whole thing would fall apart. That was my job. That's not how I saw the situation. We were all trying to take the wheel. He says I was never a band leader? I don't think that's accurate. Instead of "can't you see", try "plain for all to see". -"Plain..."? -"Plain for all to see". "Any or anyone can see". -Want a pen? -Isn't it easier with just "anyone"? "Anyone can see"? -Yay! Here we go again. -Going again? Where's my coach? Very close. I had a pretty neat tone there. Sounds a bit awkward. One of the main conflicts with the record company was that we insisted on releasing Manhattan Skyline as a single. We pointed to Bohemian Rhapsody. It had to be possible to try out songs in other formats. But for us it was important to release it as a single. It revealed musical ambitions of the band that we felt had been overlooked. That we weren't a cartoon band. The result was that we lost the US. And it haunted us for a long time. We wanted to win back the US. Yeah. Wait a minute here. -Okay, I'm ready. -Waste a couple of rounds. Are you ready? I'm ready. Let's just go. I gotta get this thing. That's good. Good. Okay, last ones. I'm gonna have you coming at my camera. Come towards me, Morten. Look at me, guys. This is the final one. Beautiful there. Go on. Can you just... You looked away from me. There, there, there! Beautiful that. I've gotta bring three guys together that sometimes don't want to. But sometimes they do wanna be together. Then they don't wanna be together. It's hard as a photographer when people don't wanna be together in a picture. Smile! Can you do it one more time? One more time! Come on. I guess that's it. Alright. Okay, I got it. Thank you! I can't do this. I'm just whining up there all the time. I can't do this. There's no fucking break. It's my voice at the same level all the way. Don't tell me it sounds good. We've been through this. This was the first song everyone was pleased with. That's bullshit, Lars. My point remains exactly the same. I can't sit here whining. I mean, that's why I don't want it. Because it's high-range, no breaks. My voice all the time. I'll drop out because I'm so sick of my own voice. -But... -Is it the key? It's just me, me. All the time. I don't think it sounds good. I've no impulse to sing it. -That's not a very constructive statement. -It is. No, Lars. Don't try to gloss over my main point. Which is that I don't want to sing that high throughout the song without a break. But the song hasn't changed for 30 years. -That's why I'm sceptical about doing it. -I didn't know that. I suggested lowering it an octave. Constructive input. If Pal and the girls sing "I don't wanna cry again..." -You come in at "Oh, but how..." -Yeah, that's a big difference. I think everyone who works with us ends up exhausted from working with us. And then there's a tug of war, grinding of teeth, dirty looks and plenty of reluctance. When we made the Bond song, John Barry was the producer. It turned out that he had to be included as songwriter. We hadn't been informed. There were a few chords in that song I was particularly fond of that he wiped out in the string arrangement. So we manipulated the 80-piece orchestra to play another note than what he put in. I think it pissed him off. In one interview he called them "Nazi Jugend". I'm afraid so, yes. That's what he said to me. So he felt it very strongly. Right. Must we get into it? He encountered a band that had a great deal of self-confidence. He was used to being the dictator, I think. Our general rule was that we simply ignored everything that was said. We nodded and smiled, and fundamentally disagreed about everything. With Stay On These Roads, I felt I'd written an important song for a-ha. I ran off to Pal to show it to him. But he was busy on the phone. By chance, Morten was sitting there. So I showed it to him first, which was unusual in a-ha at the time. He asked me, "What would you do here?" So I sang "sail on" or something. Then Pal comes in from the room next door, clapping his hands. I sat up all night alone, finishing the demo, with full instrumentation, which was used as it was when we recorded it. On the third album we tried to be more poppy. Thinking like we did in the start, with stuff that didn't end up on the first album, like Touchy. I think Pal convinced himself that for commercial reasons, we needed a smarter approach. That's what he thought, I suspect. We were told that we had "the disease". "They'll destroy everything they've created." "Because they're uncomfortable with their image or how people see them." The first nail in the coffin. We wanted to write new hits. But we didn't necessarily want to turn our backs on Scoundrel Days. We wanted to hold on to our success. The songs are nice. But the videos are horrible. People might have a different image of what a-ha really is than I do. -Hi! We're a-ha! -One more time. Hi there! We're a-ha! We ended up wrapped in packaging. "Don't worry. It'll pass." We were wrong. And we remained exposed in a way that none of us could identify with at all. Were very naive about what we had to protect, what was unique about us. We just went with the flow. And it's nobody else's fault that we became a teen band. We posed for all the shoots. No matter how cheesy we thought it was, we turned up. Let ourselves be photographed in the most humiliating settings. What would a-ha have been without Morten Harket's gorgeous body and handsome face? We would've avoided a lot of problems. I mean, I'm born like this. I've never worked out. It's not easy to accept that sort of attention. -Would you strip to the waist for me? -Sure, if you did the same. Anything else? If we're gonna make it clear to the record company, "Don't book us ever again to that fucking Popcorn Magazine." "This album will force you to think differently about the band." The pendulum swung way over in the opposite direction. We tried to become a band we weren't. I was against it all the time. We were flirting with U2-ish stuff. Were trying to show something different. But it comes from the wrong place, that's the problem. It's not honest enough. Because there's this dishonesty seeping in. Which is about what we shouldn't do. So a heavy hand guided everything in the choice of songs, in the development and recording of the songs. I remember a different vibe. We were sick of our teenybopper status at that point. Those albums challenged how the band was perceived, gave us a much richer history. The 80's way of making albums was on the way out. I really felt that that was not gonna work. Pal and I agreed on the direction for East Of The Sun. After touring live, we wanted to get back to our roots with a band in studio. So we settled into the largest studio in Abbey Road for several months. Lately I've learnt a lot I should've learned a decade ago. We were naive in the beginning. -We thought we could just be famous first. -It's given us lots of problems. We haven't steered our career where we wanted. Is it possible to be more successful? You even set a world record. -How many came to the concert in Rio? -It was packed. Wasn't it almost 200,000? How can you top that? -That's not what it's about. -No? We feel we're just at the starting line. We want to leave a body of work we can be proud of, that's worth something. I'm rarely satisfied or feel at ease with what I hear on stage. The playfulness that comes when you feel at ease is very special. It's something I often miss on stage, on tour, getting there. The guy who mixes what I hear... He gets two hours of discontent every evening. I use a wide register, and many acoustic criteria have to be met in order to actually stay in touch with what you're doing. And I'm extremely demanding in that sense. Could we... take a break with that? I need to focus here. He's got better at saying "this was good". It used to be impossible for him to be pleased with a concert. He was never happy. And of course this drains the energy from the people around him. I'm exhausted. Too many repetitions of the same stuff. I'm howling all the time. So it's making me a century older. That's when it starts to bite. It's not good for your mind or your voice. That's life for a singer. It's easy to say, "Relax, don't worry." It's like sending a downhill racer out on the slope blindfolded. If you don't have good sound, it can easily go wrong. We've never performed our songs like this. So it's all new. But people know the songs, and that's what creates a connection. We have some catalogue stuff we've rarely played. My worry is that it'll be too... That it's too nice and orderly, with lots of neat transitions, that kinda stuff. -Stuff that makes me fall asleep. -Like what? -It's a general problem. -The arrangements are all so elaborate. There's no... Yeah, I get the point. Know the feeling. But I think much of it sounds okay. Everything sounds okay. That's not it. But maybe iron out the details. Can we just add Sox Of The Fox there? -Your call. -Before Memorial, yeah. Pal has a knack of getting his way. That doesn't work the same way for Magne and me. And when I say "Magne and me", it's because I mostly agree with Magne's reactions, his understanding of things. That's how it's been through the years, and still is. But not always. Pal has a great deal of unused material that he wants me to try out for starters. But for that to happen, it really has to feel right for all of us. There won't be any a-ha album until all three agree on it. No matter how many songs you've written. None of us have the right to use a-ha as our personal playground. The conflict with Pal over the early songwriting credits. That's the main obstacle. I've done a lot without being credited based on how you define songwriting. If you say a song is what you sing and play on an acoustic guitar, then my riff on Take On Me doesn't count. There are different definitions. That's Pal's. People nowadays write songs in a different way. You have a guy saying, "I wrote the bassline on this song." "I wrote this part. I wrote that part. I added this. I'm a songwriter." That's not the type of song I feel I'm writing. Like building a table. You can decorate it with different cups, put a flower on it. But you still made a table. Yeah, sure... If you came up with the legs so it doesn't fall over, it's an important part of it. But if it's just decorating, you give it to someone who'll decorate it differently. My contribution is constantly underrated. It's not basslines or drum programming. It's about toplines, riffs, themes that are defining and that change the song's character. In the very beginning, Pal and Mags wrote the songs. Pal wrote more than Magne. And Pal was more forceful in getting his stuff across. That was a source of friction. Anything he played that I loved, I felt like I'd picked up and made happen. I can't think of one song that we didn't record. Maybe one. There was a song called Trees Never Grow On Sand. Morten didn't like the singing. He also wasn't writing sort of lyrics back then. So I depended on him doing that for my songs to be included. The result was always that all my songs were cowritten, of course. But where I contributed with musical themes and stuff on his songs, it wasn't always credited. I'm sure the story would've been different if all three were credited, like in U2. Which worked very well for that band. From day one they agreed to share it all equally. You're lucky to get the success you get. It's such a joy. You're playing music for thousands of people. Like, enjoy it! Kinda sinful not to really appreciate what you have when you have so very much. Those guys need a shrink all together. Each one individually, and then as a band. Are you okay? We ok too! Pal always has plenty of stuff going on musically, so I let go. Stopped caring. It ended like it often does with a-ha, in a tug of war, bad vibes. I started to feel ready to get out of a-ha altogether. I decided to move back to Norway. Our first son had arrived. My wife was unhappy in London. I told the others. "I'm moving back home. I've got 18 months of national service." "And that basically means no more a-ha for me." "We'll have to see what happens after that." I think I needed to get out of the group and get into my own creative stuff. Plus I've been an artist at heart from the beginning. Just basically expressing myself on napkins and envelopes on tour. And it started to raise its voice. When I started to take making paintings seriously, for real, it was basically a reaction to the machine a-ha had become. It was mainly very therapeutic for me to do something on my own. Working with music and painting pictures feels very similar. You want the same feeling, want your hair to stand on end. That mood... Mood is everything. It was a huge relief for me to get into the Wild Seed project. It's important to remember that in a-ha, our roles became fixed after a while. Pal and Magne had played in bands together since they were 10 or 12 years old. Carving out a place would demand a pushiness that I simply don't have. Wild Seed was a huge success. It sold well and won four Norwegian Grammy awards. That it never became a worldwide hit was mostly down to coincidence and bad luck. Some record company person said, "Yeah, that's good." "Then it's out before Morten's solo album. Oh, I wasn't supposed to say that." I was like, "What's up with that?" I don't know who told him, how it was communicated to him. It was news to me. I only found out ages later. Like, many years later. I was pretty pissed off. You've been recording for almost a year, preparing songs for the next album. Pal was very unhappy with my vocals. And I didn't feel at home on Memorial Beach, the previous album. Not at all. I felt I was the wrong guy for Pal. I thought like, "Feel free." "Find someone who does what you want." I felt it could've been handled better so I didn't waste time on stuff that isn't gonna happen. That's when I started sort of figuring out, "Time to do something else." It's never been my desire to be in a band. I'm in a band with him because I was submerged in music. I had to come out on the other side as a writer or die. I had to learn music or get divorced. Because it was just 24/7 with him. But it's weird to suddenly be in the middle. "What am I doing in the middle? I should be over there!" Give me a hug. You did great. Nice. We should do it again. It's four years since their last show, but now a-ha's back together. Even though we dropped out, we never settled it. It's always been there. Unfinished business, like. We never felt we were done. It would be natural to do it. The question is when. There's this feeling of a common destiny. There are some good signals in what we're working on now. There's a lot more potential, and as long as there is, it's interesting to go on. Before the release of the new album, Minor Earth Major Sky, there was a while where it felt like starting over. We went to New York, Magne and I, and knocked off all the demos. Spent one day on each. Morten's songs are cool on that one. Magne came up with the fantastic I Wish I Cared, and other things I liked. I thought that could be the first single. It felt like we found a common foothold. That we had the same musical ambitions. It felt like a functional band. For me, I was in my probably best period ever with Summer Moved On. That got like six out of six in the papers. People came out of the woodwork saying, "I always liked a-ha." It seemed like every a-ha fan had turned into a journalist, with a whole different appreciation. If you know anything about our band, one band in particular shaped our path and our future. And that band happens to be from Norway, and they're called a-ha. In the early 2000's, many major names came out as a-ha fans. Coldplay were hard-core fans. U2, who stole unashamed from The Sun Always Shines On TV on their Beautiful Day, said a-ha was an underrated band. Oasis knew their a-ha. Even Kanye West. They still have a huge influence. If you listen to Blinding Lights by The Weeknd, both the drum beat and the synths are clearly, without a shred of doubt, a tribute to Take On Me. From Terry Slater, our good old manager who opened everything up to us. "FAME, like a wayward girl, will still be coy" "To those who woo her with too slavish knees," This is by Keats. "But makes surrender to some thoughtless boy," "And dotes the more upon a heart at ease; She is a Gipsey," "will not speak to those who have not learnt to be content without her;" "Ye Artists lovelorn! madmen that ye are!" "Make your best bow to her and bid adieu," "Then, if she likes it, she will follow you." He's absolutely right. Fuck fame. If you thirst for fame, you can just forget it. Every album we make starts with a honeymoon period where we go into it thinking we should come together in the studio, see what happens. But pretty soon the problems begin to manifest themselves. Two things that made everything difficult was moving to different countries, and e-mail was invented. Magne would write ten pages. Morten would write one line. I would be four lines. Before that, you had to pick up the phone, and it got a bit harder to be... You know, as isolated, and sort of... We didn't dig trenches quite as easily. The Analogue album didn't sell. The record company was about to give up on a-ha. But the Analogue single was a hit, and reopened the UK market. And we were planning to retake the US. So we needed another real hit. We didn't have one. So Foot Of The Mountain ended up being a "maybe" song. It started out as two songs. One by me. And one song by Pal. In the old days we'd probably end up trying to knit them together somehow. That was often the process, a bit from me, a bit from him, see how it turned out. This time it was Harald Wiik who suggested it. He was the one who "interfered" and suggested we try to merge them. It's like physically amputating your song and putting something in. I'm writing a chorus about escaping the city. He's throwing shit about me in the verse. You know, I can't get behind that. Pal suddenly says, "This won't do. This is a private song." And we feel... We try to digest it. But we feel he's wrong. Primarily because... I don't really believe him. Pal wanted to remove his part. You know, "Write your own fucking chorus." Finally Morten and I told him, "If you do it, you've terminated a-ha." "Then you're fired." Is Pal still in the band? Pal's next comment was, "Why all the bad vibes in the band?" So he backed down. I let it slide. But I don't pay any attention to that song. I would never have suggested it today. I wouldn't have dared to. But what I've realised, what I'm really sorry for, is how important this is for Pal. Much more important than I realised. I like a poison pen song as good as anybody. I love them. But that's why you have solo albums to put that stuff on. One amazing thing about a-ha is that after 35 years, they're still among the world's greatest live bands. I don't think people realise how huge they still are. This is the last time I ask you. Has anything changed? Do you feel more like going to the studio to record something with the others? It's not that I wouldn't like to. It's just that I've done it before. And always ended up being disappointed. But this could be a big hit with a-ha. We should've gone to New Orleans. Rented a huge house somewhere. With voodoo and chicken feet, like. Stayed there, seen it through, sweated it out together. I've said so for ages. I know for certain that it's true. That could've brought back a-ha. They're not hungry enough. Like when they were dumpster diving in England. Morten ate mouldy cookies. They were hungry. They were bent on making it. I think they still haven't made their best record. If I can get one more song in there that's a good a-ha song, ten more, whatever, it's worth the hassle. I can go through a lot of stuff. If we can strengthen the legacy of the band, I don't mind going, you know, through the painful bit. Ten, twenty years from now, they'll go through our list. All our little quibbles about everything means absolutely nothing to anybody else. To me it doesn't feel like there's any upside. It just feels like... Going into a room where I've simply felt awful. AGAINST ANXIETY What we know about cardiac fibrillation, is it often affects young people who push themselves. My experience is that when I've had the most emotional pressure, that's when it rears its head. So in that sense it's obviously connected to the band and its history. Pal was extremely supportive then. As if in a way... That the way we'd treated each other had real consequences. So it was Pal at his most caring. He called me. "Magne, we have to do this so that it works for you, for all of us." "We have to try to... Can't have a situation that makes you sick." I thought it was really sweet. I was... So then it was like, a few moments of love, and it was... But I'm the difficult figure in Pal's life too, and everything I say about him does have a counterpoint in him. A-ha was never based on friendship. Of course there's friendship. But it's not the cornerstone, not what brought us together. We had a bond through music. That was our strength. We wouldn't have stuck together otherwise. I think we have a genuine respect for our talents. We still appreciate each other very much. No less than before. Maybe more.
