Arhangelskaya as the Girl Hi Crutch. Give me my balloon! Hey! The musician's going away! Catch him! Give us your balalaika! Why are you vexing him? Go on, don't be afraid. Hello. Don't cry. Don't cry. What's the matter, dear? "B" is a good mark. Don't get carried away, Sasha. And don't sway. From the top! This is uneven. What's wrong with you? One more time, from the top. Tempo. Tempo. Count time, Sasha. Once again. That's enough. What should I do with you? Too much imagination. Good-bye. Wait, Seryoga! Stop! Stop! - Come on down. Let's boogie. - What? Let's boogie. When you go to lunch, get me some ice-cream And get yourself an Eskimo pie. I know you. You'll get one for me and you'll go hungry. Sergei, need any help? Or do you want to do it yourself? Or I'll run into the building and bring 15 people down. Give me the wrench. Can't you see it? There it is. Look, the musician is there. Come over here. What? Want a ride? Come on. What's this handle for? It's not a handle, it's the reverse. Reverse? Where's the drive? - There isn't any. - What do you mean? - It disappeared. - That's impossible! - Everything3 possible. - Then how come we're driving forward? Aren't you smart? Here it is. Can't you get by without a helper? Want me to answer to her? - Forget her. - What? Do you want to drive? Let's Musician! - See that? - So what? Push on forward. Then pull back sharply. Get down, musician! All you are good for is fiddling. Look at him. Stop! Good job. - How about one more ride? - No, we'll be late for lunch. Move on kids. You're in the way. Alright worker. Let's go for lunch. I'm coming. - Leave me alone, Vic. - Are you gonna do it again? That's not fair. - Let's save him. - You save him. - And you? - Two against one? - But I have this. - I'll hold it. See you later. Why pick on someone who's smaller than you? Excuse me? Let go of him, or I'll hit you! Go ahead! Where are you going? Come on. Want me to hit you again? - Where are you? - Here. Let's go then. Your morn won't recognize you. But if she does... who beat up who? You'd better wash up. Don't be scared of anybody. I was beaten up a lot too. I'm not scared. I hit him so hard he just... - A real worker. - What kind of worker is he? He's a musician. - What did you say? - A musician. Oh, that got to you. Come back here now! What do you think you're doing? What, you get your bread free? Or do you think that loaves grow on trees? Pick it up! What if somebody threw your violin on the ground? - What's your name? - Sergei. Hey, where are you? Sergei! - Where were you? - I got lost. Everything came crashing down. Okay. Let's go. My mother always boils my milk. Why? She's afraid I'll get brucellosis. Don't drink it then. - You drink it and you're ok? - So far, so good. Come on, come on, don't be shy. Let me do that. Thank you. My music teacher smokes small cigarettes in orange packs. That's Dukat. I guess they're Dukat. - These have no filter. - Which ones are better? Dukat are the stronger ones, - but, hell, they're all bad. - Why do you smoke, then? - Do you bite your nails? - Yes I do. Isn't that a habit? What's good about it? - Have you ever been in a war? - What? - Have you ever been in a war? - I have. Was it scary? It must be scary to be in a war. I was about your age then. I knew you were in the war. You know everything, don't you? Get me the pliers from under the seat. We'll fix it. - These? - No, the other ones. Wow! This must cost a lot of money. It cost only 60 rubles. It's a half. Doesn't look like a half. That's what a child's size violin is called. When my fingers get as big as yours I'll get a real violin. A whole one, in about five years. - How long have you studied it? - Two years. - How old are you? - Seven. How long must you study to be a violinist? Long time. My teacher says all my life. I guess you have to start young to get used to it. Want to hold it? It's light. What are those zig zags? Sound holes. To improve the sound. They're resonators. From the word "resonance". If the resonance is good the sound is good. If it's bad, the sound is bad. Hear that? Not too good. Here it's better. Would you play something for me? Okay, brother. Back to work. How long will you be working here? We finish today. What's that? Put some iodine on it at home. It's always like that. It's from my violin. - Did you see "Chapayev"? - Yes. Why? Nothing special. There's a cinema across the street. - Wanna go? - Okay! I'll meet you by the gate at 7. Don't be late. - 7 o'clock? - 7 o'clock. - Sasha? - Mom? My goodness! What hands! What's that? Axle grease. - From what? - Like oil. - Did you practice? - For three hours. You mean you played with such dirty hands? Go wash them. You've upset me again. It won't come off: it's axle grease. Besides, I'm in a hurry. I have to go downstairs. - Go where? - Downstairs. I have a new friend. He drives a steamroller. You know, he paves... Stop the "you know". Why do you always say "you know"? Does your friend do that too? - What will you two do? - We'll go see "Chapayev". But we don't know him. Why didn't you invite him over? - He won't come. - Why not? - He just won't. - Why not? I asked you, why? Mom, he's waiting for me. I promised. Indeed. Have you forgotten that Natasha and her mother are visiting you today? You told them you'd be home. That was a promise too. That's no way to behave. Mom... Hey kid, do you know where Sasha lives? What bit hi m? Sasha! Come inside at once. IT'S NOT MY FAULT. MY MOTHER WON'T LET ME GO. SASHA. What are you doing here? Waiting for someone? I'm going to see "Chapayev". THE END
