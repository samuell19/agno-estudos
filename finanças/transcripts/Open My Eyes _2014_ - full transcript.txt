-Music- In the beginning God created the heavens and earth. My love... my child... my Paul. Who says that beauty is the eye of the beholder? Beauty is beauty. You know when you see it or not. Let’s be honest. Some people are beautiful, and some people aren’t. Plain and simple. Let me tell you what’s beautiful. Power is beautiful. Wealth is beautiful. Style is beautiful. As an artist, I have the responsibility... to search it, find it, and capture it with my camera. It has always been my dream To create something truly transcendent. Something pure and beautiful That goes beyond This ugly world we live in. C’mon doll face. Give me some attitude. Tony, move that key two steps to the right Guys... Okay okay okay. That’s good! Let’s go. What are you giving me indifference? This is the cover of vogue. This is your career. What does that mean to you? Get that stupid smile off your face. Human beings smile. You, are not a human being. Not right now. Human beings are sick. Ugly. Hateful. You... you’re are above all that. You’re untouched by sorrows. No cares, no worries. Why? Because you’re beautiful. Perfect. Yes... that’s the one. Download those files. Yes sir. We’re done here. -MUSIC- Aren’t you gonna look at the other pictures? Of course not. I know I got it. Have I ever told you how awesome you are? Yeah... Not often enough though. Are you gonna call the client? No... That’s your job. What if they don’t like them? Tony, remember that model shoot we did for Lancome? Real dog show, right? Yes, I remember. See, I have the ability To take a plain pretty girl And turn her into a goddess. So, you’ll be fine. Call the client and tell him what a genius I am. Send him the files? No... send them in the morning. Make ’em wait for it. Attaboy Tony. This calls for a night out in town. Good idea. Carmen? Why not. Yes please... I can use a drink Not so fast sugar. You still have work to do. So... I guess I’m not invited? Not tonight babe. Tonight is Carmen’s night. When’s it gonna be my night? When you have legs like hers. -MUSIC- Good night Whatever Umm... you got that stuff? Don’t I always? Get it out Here you go...

Paul Dan is coming for a meeting tomorrow Alright then... Famous Miami photographer Paul Sanders... suffers tragic accident Even though he survived... his career is over And God said: "Let there be light" And there was light. And God saw the light was good... and he separated the light from the darkness -MUSIC- Jesus paid it all... all to Him I owe Sin has left a crimson stain He washed it white as snow... Ooohh... Jesus paid it all... all to Him I owe Sin has left a crimson stain He washed it white as snow... Ooohh... My Jesus, my King, I wanna thank you Carla Coming here has changed my life It wasn’t us Abby... it was the Lord Now all I need is a steady job Well, we’re looking for people at the restaurant...

I understand how you feel Oh... you do... do you? So you were blind once? How did it work out for you Pam? Was it a life changing experience... or simply inconvenient? You’re lucky to still be alive... you know that? Oh yeah... Thank you Jesus for saving my life! So I can be blind You can try being nice to people What good would that do to me now? Truth is... you weren’t nice to people... even when you weren’t blind Have a seat Dan Hey Paul Dan, so lucky to have you as my agent? You’re the only person that can get a blind photopher some work So... how is it going? You wanna trade places? No... not particularly It has its advantages... you know?! I haven’t seen a bad movie ever since I’ve been blind Look Paul, we get it... you don’t need to keep reminding us Is there anyway we can get to the point of this meeting... gentleman? So... I’ve got an idea for a book... a picture book Like a coffee table... very high end... like Bruce Webber... Annie Leibovitz... that kind of thing Look... there’s already a lot of interest in this I talked to folks at Simon & Schuster and they’re on board... They’re thinking part picture book and the other part life story Except that there won’t be a happy ending... huh? Look Paul... you’re a very wealthy man... but, you still need to make a living and, with your collection of photography... I think we have enough for several volumes And, the fact that you are getting 15% of the bottom line... Has nothing to do with it? I’m doing this as a favor to you... not as your agent In fact, I’m not even sure that I’m still your agent I have to look at the contract I see... or should I say... I understand It would fall under one of those "Act of God" clauses Look... if you’re not interested... fine I just thought I’d throw it out there Let him think about it Dan You would think about it... won’t you Paul? I didn’t hear a yes You didn’t hear a no either Alright... well... I gotta go Call me when you’re ready to talk You think this is a good idea? You got a better one? You know its gotta be you who goes thru thousands of images And you’re gonna be doing that all by yourself Of course... it has to be me... Who else is gonna do this for you? That’s the spirit -MUSIC- How am I doing? Well, the carpets can be cleaned...

Really Well... at least he still is who he is Yea... unfortunately She is just a waitress... you know? Here you go Thank you You’re welcome I’ll be in the kitchen No, please... sit... everyone You sure? I... don’t like eating alone Very well... You know... This pie is actually pretty good Well... will wonders ever cease? Would you like a slice? I’ll pass You know... this is kind of embarrassing but... I never asked you your name It’s Abby... Abby? As an Westminster... Of course... I did a photoshoot there once It rained everyday... Were you with me Tony? I was with you Oh... that’s right Can I ask you a question? If it’s not too personal... Oh boy... Can you still see things... like... in your mind? Yea... it’s all frozen in time... as I remember it... Places... people... they’ll never get old... They’ll never change... They’ll stay the same... as I remember them Like a photograph Yea... funny... what burns me up though... The last thing I remember seeing What was that? Some stupid girl in the middle of the street... Holding up a sign that said "repent"... Can you imagine? Some people are really so ridiculous Maybe you should have... Should’ve what? Repented... Excuse me?! Well... I mean... I think it’s time for you to go I’m sorry... I didn’t mean to upset anyone Are you a Jesus freak?! I don’t know what that means... I... Surrendered my life to Jesus a Jesus freak... I guess I’ll go Was that your plan... to come and preach to me... I was... Trying to convert me... send me on the path of righteousness... I was just trying to be nice And look where that got you You people make me sick... Can’t hack it in the real world... You gotta go crying in the shoulder of some... Mythological god that doesn’t even exist... How pathetic... And why should I repent? God’s the one who made me blind... As far as I’m concerned... He should be apologizing to me C’mon Paul... she didn’t mean to hurt you I should’ve known better... I thought you were nice... ’Cause you’re nice... Not because you’re trying to score points with Jesus But everybody’s got their own agenda... don’t they?! I’ll go... Yea... Go... and on your way out... Tell Jesus you blew it for the team!!! Didn’t I just tell you... she’s not your type?! Enjoy your meal Hey Miss... Really? You got a second? No... I really don’t Two minutes... it’s important So... what’s so important? Paul sent me over to apologize He couldn’t do it himself? Big surprise You’re right... he never apologizes... But... I gotta say this is the first time... he’s ever shown any remorse He wanted me to give you this What is that? Look, one thing you need to know about Paul is... Underneath that gruff exterior... There’s a lot of anger and bitterness But... underneath that, he’s a good man Could’ve fooled me -MUSIC- Paul, I’ll be there in a minute I’ll get it... ’bout time I do something around for a change Hello... Hello... Hello... Who was it? I don’t know What is that? Can’t buy forgiveness What?! Somebody left a note that says... Can’t buy forgiveness What does it mean? -MUSIC- Abigail... here’s the order for Mr. Sanders Can somebody else take it today? I thought we agreed that you would take his food Not anymore He specifically requested you I find that hard to believe You’re telling me you’re not gonna do your job?! Yea... I am Time to eat How you doing today Abby? Abby isn’t here today Mr. Sanders I specifically requested her Yes... I know... Manny told you she had to serve you or leave So... she left She quit rather than serve me? Quit... Fired... It’s a fine line Was she happy there? Happier than me... She was coming out of dark place... you know... The job gave her a sense of... normalcy I know there’s a shadow lying underground but... I stand where light shines... That’s nice To the left Paul Stay here... I got this Who is it? It’s Paul... Paul Sanders What are you doing here? I came to apologize What? I came to apologize Really? Can I come in... or shall I do it here? Come in Do you wanna sit down? You’d have to help me... it’s not my house I’m sorry about your job I talked to Manny... and he said he’d take you back So you’re here to apologize for Manny No... I’m here to apologize cause I was a jerk I’m sorry but... the subject on God... is a rather sensitive one for me If he existed... I would have a serious problem with him But since he doesn’t... according to you... Than talking about it shouldn’t make you any angrier than... Talking about say... Elves I suppose... Am I forgiven? Being a christian you are obligated to forgive me... you know That is pretty bold coming from a man that is not religious It is true though Isn’t it? Yes... of course But I’m not gonna forgive you out of obligation... I appreciate you coming over... i really do... I know it’s not easy for you to admit you’re wrong There’s a first time for everything Forgiven? Yes... forgiven Great... So, you’ll go back to the restaurant? Yes... And bring me my meals everyday? Everyday I’m on shift Sounds like a deal By the way, was that you playing before? I... heard some guitar music down the hallway Yes.. that was me. Prettly awful huh? No... it was beautiful It was? Yes... I’d like it very much if you would play for me sometime I... I would like that very much -MUSIC- She’s a very nice girl Nice? Yea... nice... Why? I’ve never heard you call a girl nice before... Hot... yes... Sexy... yes... But never nice What are you my conscience all of a sudden? I’m just saying boss Hey... Hi...

I’m telling you... You know that Paul doesn’t have the best reputation? In a lot of ways... he’s exactly like Todd Oh... you’re wrong... you’re very wrong I hope I am Isn’t this what God wants me to do? I’m not judging... I just don’t wanna see you get hurt again Alright... I gotta go... bye... Paul... I have a rough layout of photos for the book...

She died with nothing... Alone But, she had you I don’t think I was of much comfort Her last years was very hard I couldn’t even look at her... unless through the lens of my camera I couldn’t bear to see her suffer like that... you know?! Couldn’t say I loved her... I couldn’t even say goodbye You’ll have your chance Where... In heaven?! Yes There’s no heaven... There’s no God... If there were... I would hate him for the life He gave my mother If this is the way God treats good people... Than He’s a monster You know what really makes me mad? If he could see her... He wouldn’t give her the time of day He has seen her When? You know... the night Paul had his accident ’Cmon... Paul wouldn’t pay attention to any of the waitresses She wasn’t a waitress... Not back then... She was with Todd Evans You’re kidding?! That little goodie goodie Not at all... she wasn’t a goodie goodie Not back then... What’s so funny? He doesn’t recognize her?

She’s the girl... you gave her a ride home that night You gave her a ride home instead of Paul Don’t guilt trip me Pam Poor Paul doesn’t even realize it And he should never Oh no... we wouldn’t want to hurt Paul’s feeling... And certainly we wouldn’t want to ruin an untainted reputation... After all... she has seen the light Why do you hate her so much? I don’t hate her...

She was my girlfriend... backup singer in my band... Remember... friends with benefits... You know... the night of the accident Would you consider me for a subject Do you have any experience? Oh... I’ve got plenty of experience That was you? That’s what I’ve been trying to tell you Paul I’m not as innocent as you thought I was Innocent?! What she didn’t know when she got to me... She picked up awfully fast I was innocent when I met you You only used me... you crushed my dreams You were only looking for a sugar daddy And appearantely still is Is that what you think? Honey, you may have fooled Paul... but you never fooled me I never asked him for a thing Did I Paul? Oh no... ambitious girl with dreams... Famous guy with money... Yes...

I just found out I didn’t want her making a fool of you I remember her now There was a darkness around her The same that’s around me And you... That’s not darkness Paul It’s reality Who was I to think that I could build a new life? My sins are going to haunt me forever That is not true Abby... Christ paid the price for all of our sins on the Cross I’m still asking for forgiveness for mine I’ve just never been so humiliated Who was that? I’m sure it was Paul who wants to talk Well... hello?! Aren’t you going to answer it? No... You should’ve seen the way he turned his back on me Like if I wasn’t there So... let me get this straight... You want forgiveness... but... You’re not willing to give it to him? What makes you think he wants forgiveness? Hello... why else would he be calling? Better to hurt than be hurt What? That’s his motto It’s no use She’s not gonna answer I think I may have been a little to hard on her Just let it go boss You think she and I could... There’s nothing there for you boss The way I see it... You guys are from totally different worlds My grandma use to say... There’s nothing wrong with the bird and fish to fall in love with each other the problem is... where are they going to build their nest? Well... I gotta go boss You gonna be okay? Alright... well...
