Your tickets, please. Your tickets, please. What about you? I'll never wear these again. No, come in. Come on in. I've already taken of my underwear. Even if it hurts more, make it quick. Give me some more. More. Or I'm going to scream. I could buy two like you one after the other. How dare you? Who gave you the right? - Very well, Miss. You've been my first man. Let me look you in the face for once. That's important to me. Tell someone else, Miss. Flowers, please. Which ones do you want? - How much? Give me a men's magazine. - Which one? The most explicit one. How much? - 12 marks. would you offer these flowers to me? Today is an important day for me. I'm celebrating and I'm all alone. Would you offer these flowers to me? Do you know why I'm celebrating? Because I became a slut today. What do you want? Would you like to buy this magazine? Careful, or I'll cut you. Don't move. I'm not in love with you. I'm selling myself. I won't undress completely. I'll only stay here for twenty minutes. Don't get that familiar with me. If something doesn't please me, I'll scream. Lift yourself up. Don't crush me like that. It really hurts. I haven't seen your ticket yet. I don't have one. Tell me what I have to pay. - Where are you going and when did you get on? - I can't remember. Well then, Miss? So tell me what I've to pay. Your tickets, please. The sun... Look, that's the pope's window. It's in the Vatican and there are more than one hundred rooms. More than one hundred rooms. One hundred rooms. All roads lead to Rome. See Rome and then die. No. See Naples and die. What a lot of people. Blondie. Will you get on? Get on. She's better. Come, I'll give you a ride. Give me some room. Who's that whistling blackbird? Is he after us? - No, he was after me. It's not a problem. I'm still trembling. - What did you say? That we don't care, we've got the Japanese men. These Japanese men are small, but... They get everywhere. - What? Why are you hooked? - Not at all, I'm pushing. They are small, yellow, but they're clean. Japanese men. I never liked those yellow faces. You're the one to talk, racialist. It's enough they stump up the H from their bags. What are these 'bags'? The bags? The ones where you put the potatoes in, right? Wake up. What's your name? - Ingrid. Hey, where are you from? - Finland. Well, that's not saying much. Nothing much at all. But I like you, lngrid. Do you know that you could be one of us? Do you know this Finnish girl? I'll present her to you. She'll join us now. Who are they? - Those? They are nothing. Who are these men who follow us around? What do I care, They're studying in order to become queer. lsn't that a horse pulling cows? Look at those little boys. Go home. Ingrid, where will you sleep tonight? What about you? - I sleep at... a friend's house. He's a painter. You know, one of those men who dirty canvases. One who makes contemporary art. We'll find another place before long. Anyway, we'll find it day by day. Give me that baton, I want to change the music. Claudia, you'll wake it up. Do you see how nice this sun is in autumn? It definitely doesn't look like November. You know, yesterday a man said to me: "How much do you want for my company?" And l told him: "I'd say 5,000 Lire". And he said: "Company, forward, march. "Left-right." What you laughing at, baby face? Don't pretend to have a Honda instead of that rubbish motorbike. They're all idiots. Where are you coming from? - I went to mass. Did she really go to mass? Yes, she ran the tests. She was admitted to become a slut at Tor di Quintol Make way. We're Romans. We're the best flowers in the garden. Flowers of sluts. To hell with you. Coachman, can you make this horse run faster? Give me the reins back because you got my horse drunk. Where are you running? Look, it thinks it's a racehorse. Quiet or they'll throw me out. Can I ask you a question? Who are we going to see? - One of those, what's the word? Abstract. He's mad but he's a fine fellow. A painter, in short. He doesn't live here. It's just his studio. He works here by day and lets me sleep at night. In exchange for his hospitality, he wants to make love sometimes. But not so often, poor chap, he's very discreet. He has a wife and sleeps with her most of the time. We never argue... but there will be trouble if I move a drawing, a brush or a painting. When you're up there, you're not allowed to touch anything. He's armed, you know. Once, because I put a pillow on one of his paintings... just for a moment, and he was about to shoot me. Wearing this miniskirt, guess where I have to hide the key'? In there, inevitably. What are you still doing here? You've usually left by now. Come in and close the door. And what does time have to do with it? When someone is inspired by an idea, he mustn't let it go until it matures. And this is still raw. Do what you like. Get undressed, eat. Make love, if you want. But don't say a word. I must finish. Then finish. We're going to bed. We're exhausted. Who's this gorgeous piece of Viking beauty? Please, I'm not a gorgeous piece of Viking beauty. My name is Ingrid. I didn't mean to offend. Let's forget about it. This is a barbaric job. Want it? You know, I decided to buy myself, as soon as I have enough money, a boutique for elegant children. I'll call it Papalino Do you like the name? Can you please speak louder? Otherwise I'll be listening to what you say. And I'm no interested in what you say. Go paint... I've been thinking about it for many years. You won't believe it, but I dream about it even at night. I'd also like to work in such a brand new boutique, to dress up and adorn children with all kinds of colours. Listen, why don't we become partners? We'd buy it together. Perhaps you'd put in a smaller share. Who knows how much it costs? We'd need lots of money. Well, We'll get it all. Let's have a drink. Would you hand me the bottle? I've finished. Will you make room for me? How boring. What do you want? Even tonight? You painted a masterpiece. lsn't that enough? That's precisely why. I painted a masterpiece and am happy. Alright, just because it's you. But do it fast. And don't touch my friend. But I... anyway, I don't like her. Don't let me hear you, at least. Wake up. You can't sleep forever. What time is it'? It's still night. - Yes, Saint Bartholomew's night. What do you care what time it is? It's time to go. Understand? Why? Where? For making money in order to buy our boutique. Why? Have you changed your mind already? How? Walking. Why? Do you mind? Let's walk. Then walk. Why not? Just to try it for once. If it's for keeping you company. I didn't want to get up. I wouldn't even come here, but Gina was very insistent. Pina, you really like singing, don't you? Mind your own business. Where are your manners? This has been my place for seven months now. It goes from the light third pillar to the left fifth one. Look at that wonder over there. My caves. Nobody ever goes in. If you say your name in there, the echo repeats it at least five or six times. But with a very different voice. Sometimes I feel like my mother is calling me by name. And I'm in there to shout: "Claudial". Lots of times. For as long as I want. Let me try it. I like caves too. There's some in my country. I became lost in the caves when I was a child. You know, if another girl takes my place, I'd kill her. What about me? Don't you mind if I stay here with you? That's your space after all, as you said. No, you're so different. And you're friendly. Look, those who go to bed with you... would never come with me, and vice versa. We're different, that's all. It's raining so hard. Who knows when they'll come. And they say that birds fly low when it's raining. I think I'll change jobs. I'm going to be a slut. We'll see what happens soon. And if they don't stop today... you won't have to say that it's all my fault. Look, what a shame. And those thighs. What's the price today? I'm coming. Open the door. Where are we going? - Straight on. Cutie? Would you have a chat with me? Shall we spend our free time together? No money? Looking for me? Too bad it has no brakes. Hurry up and make your mind. If you don't stop you're a queer. How much? He was white with fear so he took the black one. Do you see? They all go straight on. No one wants to stop. How do you explain this? - Because you're too beautiful. Nobody believes it. They must think you're making fun of them. If I were you, I'd put that leg down and sit further back What are you waiting for? Pull that skirt down. Don't show your thighs. You're not on exhibition. Take that doll back home You won't hit the nail today in any case. Keep Laughing. Just a little more and the two of us will show all of you. Poor things Go away Sometimes I wish I had a car. First time Palmira went to a petrol-station owner by night and said: "Fill me up". Let's go home. Then she went on for nine months. That son of a bitch. Did he leave her? - Got the picture? First you get a baby from a fellow and then he backs out. Couldn't he back out before? Where's he going? Good evening, ladies. If you've no other plans, would you be so kind as to get in my car? Which one? The blonde or the brunette? - No, please, both. Two numbers. Go, the both of us. Those were really lucky. They couldn't believe it. Look, what a truck. Where are we going? Where are you taking us? - To my home, of course. You know, it's an old, ancient and uncomfortable building on the Tiber, which is falling into ruin, but I don't have the heart to give it up. Can you tell me your names? - She's Ingrid, I'm Claudia. Nice to meet you. - What's your name? Sorry, I'm Urbano. - "Urbano" like an "urban" policeman? Where are you from? - I'm a genuine Roman. She's a foreigner and comes from the North. Where are you from? - No, I come from far away. From Siberia or Russia? - No, but I still have some relatives there. Yes. I've never felt so lonely... like these last few days, since my poor wife has left me. What a story. Yes, loneliness is really a great torture, you know. How much does this car cost? One can see that you're young. You've asked me how much this car costs. Very little. It's old. Like this city. Which has become like a cesspit all damp. It makes you lose your voice. In fact I no longer speak. I don't talk to anyone anymore. I don't have any friends anymore. If they write me letters, I don't answer anymore... and don't even answer the phone. There are more ghosts than people in this city. Yes, of course, Rome is full of lights... but even a cemetery is full of strange flames by night. Here, a woman perhaps, just a woman could be the only living thing. But it's so hard to find one. It's a city full of nothing. Here. Come in. This is my bedroom. It has been empty for a long time. Please, don't be afraid, have a seat. Come here, Miss. Like this. You too, sit down. May l? Yes, like that. That's it, excuse me, let your beauty flare up. These are times when virtue must bow before vice... and ask it for forgiveness just to be virtuous. The Book of Truth. "Treachery of mortal sin is huge... as well as also the infallibly produced in a soul being guilty for that. Which is this effect'? The death of the soul itself'. Please, you read now. How nice this dark stain is... on this slope... sloping towards the hidden... Come here. That's it. And now, give me your hand. Here. All three. I live here, surrounded by these shadows. Urbano. And you, lppolito... were a prince, you died at the age of six Bertrando. My ancestors. Cardinals, men of arms, thieves, killers, rapists. Mostly killers. Now my poor Clara has gone and joined them. She's no longer here. Now be like lambs and snakes at the same time. Who are those people? - My wife, Princess Clara, as I told you, has recently abandoned my life and my love. I need to see and hear her again. If not her as a living and true woman, at least her astral body. I still have to ask her many things, to be comforted by her, by her soothing words, by her deep eyes- But, as you see, not even the greatest mediums can evoke her. Prince and come back to me. Here. Wait. Prince. What do we have to do with what you were telling us? Like that. Here. You can already hear something. - Yes, me too. Quiet. A force is circulating. You see, I think the only way her sweet soul can come back and... visit me, talking to me again, if I well knew her thoughts, and her rages, is that I lie here... Prince, are you teasing us? And vent my marital lust with a woman like you. No, rather, to achieve a more certain result, with two women like you. You, who look so smart, will understand me better than your friend. Only an outraged soul can come back in anger... to where it was outraged. Nothing might use a bigger offence to a sweet soul than the fact that, let's say, I'm amusing myself here on her or rather on our with two streetwalkers like you. Two beautiful ones, I'd say. Quiet, I said. The force is increasing. The beats have started to mock. The séance table is lifting. You wear it, Miss. This is my poor Clara's nightgown. No garment was more dear to her. That's why there will be no fiercer offence to her ever. You won't lose anything. Come on, wear it. And then we'll see what happens. That's it. Let's see. That's perfect, yes. Clara, my sweet Clara. Your scent, your smoothness. Here, on the pillow where she's rested her head so many nights. Clara. Come. We're waiting for you. Where she has been talking to me many times... Clara. If you're here, make it clear. Clara. And has been loving me. Clara. Both of you come here, like that. Sweetie. Here she is. Who's she? - Quiet. Here she is, she's coming, like that. I feel like she's coming. Hold me. Yes, like this, again. Here, you see, she's coming back I feel she's already back She's here. She's here among us. She's real. More real than us. She's going to touch you now. She has come back to life again. That's it. She's touching you. You see, my child, my Clara has come back from her absence. She will speak to us now. She will tell us everything. It's her. It's not her at all. My pretty, if you wanted to take us here to do your special tricks, you'd have told us before. Good accounts make for good friends. Control yourself at least, Miss. Excuse me, my dear, but I'm not ready for your deviances. I know, my dear. I'm sorry. - We're really down in terms of quality. Even reaching the streets, I don't know... Yes, you're light. I thought... Next time all we have to do is to light a small fire instead of the candles. Anyway, I promise you that next time... - I find that indelicate. I'm not talking about my gratification, but your frustration. Let me get the picture, what were you going to do? A black mass just for you? - No. To have us die of fear? Her and me? And who believes in spirits? - It's just a game my wife and I play. The contact between living and dead. My wife loves approaching other women and playing dead. Don't you, my dear? That's it. - And what about those behind? They are the audience, the faithful, the mystic participants. The vovyeurs. - No, my dear. Don't be so gross. I'll introduce them to you now. Ambassador Gabboli. Next to him Countess Lambera. Marquis De Vinci. Countess Fraziota... and the one sitting over there is our dear Duke De Matteis. Baroness Branzini Poggi. Come. Come kiss the hands of these two beautiful girls. Madam Giuliani. Don't show your disappointment. And that one is Raniero de Vinci, a Plenipotentiary Minister. But because of you he's too sad... to get up and greet you. They've not been damaged. Why don't you come and play snooker with us? Everyone will gladly cross their cues with you. We're always sorry when the entertainment hasn't gone well. Things can't be expected to be perfect every time. Séance table and snooker. Séance table and snooker. Nice. - What's the stake? - It's up to you to decide. Anyway, we're really unlucky tonight. What are you doing standing there? Are you coming here or not? Come and play so we can save our evening. lngrid. Don't be surprised at anything. We're in Rome. I perfectly remember his review. "If impersonality may be an abstraction, personality sources its reality from a synallagma of polychromies and expanded emotivities... He's supporting you, in my opinion. Clotilde, is it those two women? I don't know. You tell me. Try to turn around, Alessandro. You'll see, you won't lose your inspiration. I've never met them. I'll have an exhibition. First at Munich. Then at Detroit. Then at New York. I have to work day and night. I need about thirty pictures at least. lsn't this great? What about us? Where are we going to sleep? He received the invitation for the exhibition just this morning. Today is our wedding anniversary. Isn't this wonderful? I say that it brings luck. Yes, of course. It will bring luck. When will the exhibition be? Alessandro won't rest until he has finished his thirty paintings. 'Who can stand up and can see God's face', as that Tibetan sage stated. Lofi. - That's right, Lofi. From the sixteenth century. I hadn't forgotten him. My friend asked you a question. How many days and nights are you going to occupy our home? What's the use of time when you're creating? What do I know. Two days. One year. So we won't make love for one year. Did you never guess? Have you heard this before? Is that yours? Well, so what have you decided to do? Will you manage to be without me for a whole year? Who has the time to think about making love when you have to prepare an exhibition? And then there's Clotilde. We got married for that. My dear, please get me another coffee. Is that yours too? If you don't need it, you can leave it here. Well, goodbye then, Alessandro. So much the worse for you. Keep in mind that, even if you come after me on the street, I'll always tell you no. That's unfortunate. Just now that my friend lngrid was falling in love with you. Weren't you, Ingrid? Married. Not bad, is it? What do you say? Do you see chance? Chance. Sometimes it can freely express your point of view. Yes, you're light. It's amazing. It looks like a doll in orbit. It looks like a stellar dance. It's part of your creation and of your painting by now. It's your thing. Thanks, you're a genius. I love you so much. We're fine with the Finnish girl. As long as she lets us do it. Have you finished? What do you have to do with the number 68? What a bedroom. Enough. This is it. Be careful, boss. Or she'll hit you again. Ingrid hits hard. Keep your guard up. There'll be trouble for her. Apologise to the boss. Invoke his clemency and ask for his magnanimous forgiveness. For his slapped face. Kiss my feet. Forward. March. One by one. Stop the gramophone and bring me the record. Right now. Are you getting up from this bed or not? It's mine and Claudia's. And how many others? It's our business that doesn't matter to you nor to your friends anyway. So what? Can you get up by yourself or do you want to upset me? Listen, Finnish girl, I'll grab you how and when I want to. And thank God for meeting a man who will teach you so many things. Because no one will teach them better than Me. Try to squeeze your fingers, if you dare. Let's see. Look at that... And remember, girls. Don't touch anything, It's all on loan. Hear no evil, see no evil and speak no evil. Your head is made of stone or you're on your own. Who will let you in here again? Ingrid, what are you doing? Where does this come from? Do you know anything about it'? And this? What are you doing? Where are you going? Where do you think they got it from? What do you think? Forget about it. What's this masquerade? Where does all this stuff come from? Ingrid. What are you doing? Can't you see? I'm making love with this one. Don't touch anything. Did you hear what he said? It's not ours. Have you joined the young explorers and are you looking for trouble now? Ingrid, where are you going? Stop. Look, it's full of mice over there. What do you say'? - Me? Nothing. It's all our stuff. It's all stolen stuff. And staying here, if someone comes, we'll end up in trouble too. Who'd come? Nobody. Renato wouldn't allow it. - Who's Renato? - Renato. That pig who wanted to fondle my breast earlier? Have you known him well for long? - Of course. He's my man. He protects me. I want nothing to do with him nor with those people. Nor with you, if you're with him. Understand? I don't want pimps at all. Listen, no one asked you for anything. He protects me, not you. Though he played with your tits, I can assure that he doesn't even like you. Trust me to know his tastes. Those pimps, as you ll them in Rome. I hate them. They repulse Mel lngrid. You work and want to work in his territory. That's also mine. Were you born yesterday? Don't you know if you only move to another tree or go ten meters from our stretch of road, you'll enter another pimp's area and get a stabbing at least? I really don't care. I'm free, I'll go with whom I want and I stay with whoever I want. I don't know you anymore. I'm just telling you that he controls everything. From one street to another, from one tree to another. We all belong to him. He's mine, he's my man. Don't you know that it's a privilege to work here? Because it's his kingdom here. It's not a privilege, it's disgusting. Agreed, it's disgusting. But, Ingrid, it's a great fortune. You know how much all this stuff is worth? Millions. And it's mine. That may be so, but I don't care. I'll go on ahead by myself. And if you want me to be with you, tell him to stay out of my face. I wasn't born in Rome indeed. If I'm a whore, it's because I like it. And when I don't like it anymore, I'll give it up. I know nothing about zones, about trees which are yours or not. OK, as you want then. I did that to warn you. For your sake. But how will you stay here? Let's get some rest, Ingrid. Ingrid. Do you hear? Can you hear how many men want and desire you? Can't you hear the echo? Your name sounds good. Why don't you answer: "l'm coming"? I'm coming. Do you mind if pay now Otherwise I'll feel bad. What a hurry. Will I be allowed in with no tie? He said: "Let there be the dark and the dark fell on the earth." Who are they? Nobody. Don't mind them. Do you know them? Pretend nothing happened, let's continue. Don't you know that you can't park here? Why don't you fuck off. - Can't you hear us? - Go away. - No, I won't leave. Don't provoke him, forget him. Right now or I'll kill you. What are you doing? Don't get out. Shut up. You've been warned. If you want to take romantic walks, you must go back to Finland. - Go away, you and your useless gang. - Go back to Finland. Do as he says, go back to Finland Leave me alone. I told you but you wouldn't listen. Listen, be smart. Find yourself another job, Renato is no joke. He takes things seriously. Next time, if you meet him on the street, it's worth making the sign of the cross. So I'll find myself another job. Anyway, with this or another job, I just don't want to go back home anymore. But I won't ever put up with any bullying from a man. like your Renato for the world. Renato has decided to become your friend and make peace. Just like all of us, alter all. He actually sends his apologies for the last time, it was only a joke. Renato will let you do what and where you want from now on. He doesn't need you. As he said, there are already too many slaves to his slippers. He just asks you to deliver this package to the owner of a night-club. You must know it, the Melchidesech. It includes fine lingerie which comes from Hong Kong. There's no softer silk than this. But it must be offered by a woman. I'm not anyone's courier. And tell that ugly shit-head that he can personally deliver his fine lingerie coming from Honk Kong, to the other ugly shit-heads like him. And what do you say about these shit-heads? You'd better accept. For your trouble. From now on he'll let you circulate freely anywhere in his area. Agree. Smuggled lingerie... is better taken around by a woman, isn't it? Well? Alright. It's a deal. We'll join you later at the Melchidesech, as soon as it's night. We have another job to do before. It's clear that he wants to test you. If you're useful to him at least this time and say yes, he could save his face. It's just an excuse. I swear that this is an excuse. A lot of starlets go to the Melchidesech. It must be a gift for one of them. But I won't reproach Renato for that, he gives the most beautiful things to me only. You go, what do you re? Me and Renato will join you later, when the time comes. The Melchidesech is a brand new night club. Very classy. And you've already done your day tonight. See you later, Ingrid. Please, make sure you don't smash it up completely. Claudia, don't be too late. I don't like to be without you for too long. Don't worry. Let's go. Get a move on. What's this? A car with no doors? Is that how you treat a lady? Claudia, why do you wear make-up? You're beautiful.. Claudia, don't worry. Everythinds fine. Claudia, don't come back home. We're busy. Don't move. Who squealed or was going to squeal, Who, when drinking too much, can no longer hold his tongue and sings and sings, he must pay for that, mustn't he? Answer, yes or no? And this will teach each of you a lesson. We're not joking here... nor playing child's games. Too many things, too many gentlemen worthy of respect are depending on us. We mustnt allow that their trust is betrayed. What do you have inside your skull? What did you think you were doing? You go tell everywhere that you know a place where lots of weapons are stored. You were hoping to get away with it, weren't you? All right then, let's start. That's top notch shit. The right sort to be offered to traitors and spies like you. Our menu features nothing but this tonight. Doesn't it, maltre? Eat. Stop now, greedy pig. You wouldn't want to get indigestion, now would you? It's not Christmas yet, you know. Have a smoke now... as you always like a good cigarette after a good lunch. Dr Davide and I will now give you a little necessary surgery. I hope you won't be afraid and will behave like a man. Think about what good health you'll acquire this way. You have to take care of your health Health, first of alll Nurse, give me the scalpel. I hope you'll trust me. I've a degree in medicine and surgery, seriously. I could do surgery in normal hospitals, if I wanted to. But they would have to pay me a lot. The patient is very shaken. This may happen sometimes with particularly sensitive people. Here, like this. Let's try to calm him down with music, Let's get him stitched up. A fat pig has a lot of blood... and loses it all. That's how all traitors pay for it and you still got lucky. Others will have to pay with their lives to make peace with us. It's easy for you, let's say that you've been lucky. The Red Force will be even more red thanks to this. And now let's go and enjoy the show. What a life. How nice. There will be more and more shit. The ambulance is coming. The stretcher. Take out the stretcher. Stop here. The first floor. Watch outl - Clear the way, let us throughl What are you doing? They have to come down. Rescue me. - Where are you going? - Looking for a friend of mine. I don't want to die. lngrid. Are you hurt? lngrid. What's wrong? You look like you've been embalmed. Are you in shock? The roof is going to collapse. You have to move. They had it in for us. They did it on purpose against workers and proletarians. Too bad for those who paid with their lives. Poor people who had nothing to do with it. We had already sent warnings and signs of threats, after all, but the police has never wanted to believe us. But to whom do you attribute moral and material responsibility for the attack? Let me know what you think, frankly. To Pope John XXIII, of course, the one whom they will make a saint sooner or later. To whom else? All the others are good and peaceful kind souls in Rome. They wouldn't hurt a fly. They are all home, church and family people. Let's take the money we hid, the little we've got, our poor rags and let's run away. Let's go away. I can't stand it anymore. I'll make them pay for this. They still have to learn who Claudia is. I'll show those scumbags and low-lives. I'll report them, one by one. I know them, after all, I know them by heart, your Renato and the others. I'll send them to jail and I promise each will stay there their whole life, until their beards grow white. Are you insane? You won't report anyone. I'll make them pay for that. I know who to turn to and what to make them do. So you'll speak to the police? He'll know right away. And so do you know what will happen to us? I don't care. You know, I'm not afraid of people like that. I'll stop at the first police station and give all their names Everything I saw and was aware of. You'll say nothing. Try to open your mouth if you can. I love my life and the other things too. lf you want to know what they'll do to you, stay here, I'll tell you. I'm not as afraid as you of those criminals and of people like them. They're disgusting. and we must get rid of them, no matter where they are. With no mercy and no fear. Forever. Ingrid, stay here. Don't be foolish. Don't do anything stupid. You've heard everything, haven't you? Will you tell Renato? Don't do it, he already hates Ingrid enough. Play some music. We're getting bored here. They've caught her. They have caught her. Come on, baby, wake up. I'll take care of it. That's it. Stop that bloody noise. Play something more cheerful. Why did you come to Italy? What are you doing? Keep in mind that I want a lot of close-ups. And don't use a zoom. It's amateur stuff. If you shoot a good film, we'll sell it for top price. Golia is in the lead so far. Ninety seconds more than the others. Relax, there are still sixteen men. Ingrid, please, don't die too soon. Don't leave them disappointed, they already love you. That girl is sleeping. She's on her way to dreamland by now. Pigs. Would you like a cup of tea, Miss? You're worse... than those filthy sluts, your mothers... your sisters... and your grandmothers. You're filthier, Than all the wormy dead. Pigs. Aren't you ashamed? Son of a bitch. Queer. King of queers. What a poor joke. Are you really going to die? Renato, it's nothing. Forgive her, Lord. Live by the sword, die by the sword. Everybody get out. It's your fault. She wasn't supposed to die. She's my woman. Claudia, l swear, I didn't do it on purpose. Claudia... are you really dead? Starting from right now... for the next seven days... I don't want to hear any one of you laugh. No more singing and no listening to any music. Take her away. Finally you realise that we exist and deign to approach us, don't you, princess? Feeling all alone, are we? So why didn't you come earlier? You really loved Claudia, didn't you? Maybe because you were always a steady duo? Who did kill her? You were there too when they murdered her. Why don't you speak? It's better, you know. We're not part of your circle, you know. Renato doesn't control us. And who would have ever allowed him? He actually killed her and made that special service to you, didn't he? Why don't you go report everything to the police and give evidence against Renato and his gang? Are you afraid? You don't live in the caves any more, so why not tell everything? Or did they give you such a hard time that you lost your voice? Why not go there? You're dying of fear, that's why. And those pigs will get away with it. Aren't you disgusted with yourself? I know nothing, I saw nothing. - Too easy. Leave me alone. Coward, clear off. I don't want to see you again. Coward. You're not here yet? What are you doing? Yes, mother, I'm coming now. Father is coming now. Mother. Yes, I'm coming now. Yes, mother, I'm coming now.
