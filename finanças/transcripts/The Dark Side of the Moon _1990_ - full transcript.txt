They lock in those coordinates? No, not yet they're still tryin' to pinpoint its location. Flynn, if it's drifted behind the moon, there's no way they can lock in the coordinates. Bullshit. A nuclear arms spy satellite roaming freely in space? Come on somebody down there doesn't have their shit together. Call Spacecore Central and find out what the delay is. We're way over due on that coordinate update. Houston, this is Spacecore One. Come in please. What the hell was that? Lock automatic boost control. Come in Houston this is Spacecore One. Not responding. This is Spacecore One come in Houston. Ooh, god dammit. Get Paxton. Paxton, it's Giles. What's up gents. We're having trouble with the R3s and the stackers. Even the fifth system everything is down. Have you tried adjusting the outlays? Yep. Paxton, just see if you can get an override through Lesli. Alright, give me a moment. Lesli, we need an over ride on the bridge. Lesli, what do you mean functional? According to the bridge, nothing is functional. Everything is working accordingly. Talk to me, Paxton. Lesli, can't over ride because everything is listed as functional. We can't go to backup until we discovered just what, if anything, is wrong. I'll be up in a second. What? Set inherent dynamic stability. Well, isn't this romantic? Time for candlelight and Courvoisier. Flynn, what's going on? Why don't you tell us? You said all systems were functional. No, Lesli said that. Well, at least we have auxiliary lighting. Yeah, but for how long? 300 and, uh... 336 hours that's two weeks, and not to worry we'll get her up and running. Y'all can forget about two weeks. We got 24 hours if we're lucky. 24 hours? Yeah. Sir, auxiliary systems were hit pretty bad. They appear normal, but there's no response. It's like suddenly they got a mind of their own. Up till now I don't have a clue what happened. In all the backups? Yep. I believe, we're gonna be cooked big time. We got 24 hours auxiliary, but that don't matter because the oxygen can't last, and it's gonna get cold. Temperatures will drop below zero. That's a mouthful of good news. What's happening? Go ahead tell her. We'll you see, Cookie, without power we can't replenish the air, and you better button up because it's gonna be colder than bluegrass in Alaska in here. Hi, Doc, glad you're here. What about solar? We can't lock into the sun. Why? Because we're drifting towards Centrus B-40. Centrus B-40? The dark side of the moon. We've lost engine power, life support. No shit. I thought you were supposed to be the authority on the system. What programs were you running? Listen, I've been flying too many years to start pushing the wrong buttons. Now clearly the problem is in Lesli. She doesn't run this ship, you do. Listen you guys, I think, we can be a little bit more constructive here. You're right. We can't waste time about it. Let's do a comp analysis. We'll check her out top to bottom. Status update, Jennings? Yeah, choppin' outsets okay. And running circuits are integrated. What about the interlocks? I got Alex workin' on that 'cause it's such a tight fit. Dammit, Jennings, can't you concentrate on this. We're in deep shit here. Cookie, with you around it gets harder and harder all the time. In fact, you know somethin' else it might be your last chance to get into my flight suit. Tell you what, why don't you make a pass at Lesli, huh? Just your type, 100% robotic. Hmm. Set giro flux gate. Flip that F switch it's the white one. The white one? God. Shit. Flynn, try the power feed on the syndicator. Anything? No, nothin'. Synapse are intact. No broken cables or feed lines. I don't know understand this, Flynn. Everything should be functional. This is Spacecore One mayday. Mayday! Mayday! This is Spacecore One please acknowledge. Mayday! Mayday! Vector 4-5-1, we're an approaching Centrus B-40. This is Spacecore One please come in. Is there anyone there? Mayday. Come in please. Mayday. Goddamn it's cold. Huh, I'm freezing, Jesus. Here you go guys. Oh, I could use a cup. Yeah. Now we're talkin'. Paxton, your tea is closest to you. Thank you, dear. Jesus! Christ! Hey, you knew it had to be hot. Christ, no. It has cream in it. He's allergic to it, Alex. I'm not just allergic. Fibrillation of the heart leading to a major cardiac arrest. Is that a problem? It's not a pretty sight. I'm sorry, I didn't know. You know, you could've told me. Activate tach cam nav beacon. Yeah, so Lesli's on automatic. It'll play throughout the night. Alex just ran the logs. There's not a livin' thing anywhere near us. Jennings, put the cigarette out. What the fuck for? Because we have to conserve air. Look the SOS is fail safe. Somebody'll pick it up. Pick this up. Put it out. Hey, something's out there. It's comin' right at us. This is Spacecore One come in please. This is Spacecore One come in please. We have a visual on you. Acknowledge please, over. Vector mission micrometry. There's no response. It doesn't really matter. They must know we're here. Christ, will y'all look at that? I'll be dammed. It looks like the Settler. Initiate darkening. Discovery from the old NASA program. Jesus, I didn't know those things still flew. Program docking beacon. It looks like it's been through hell. Giles, why don't you go down to airlock and greet our guests. Rate of closure steady. Unknown contact on final approach. Activate airlock thruster pods. I hope they know what they're doing. So far so good. Why don't they make contact? Warning: Mask secure. What the hell are they waitin' for? Giles, what's going on down there? Not a thing. Okay, Giles, I'm comin' down. Let's get suited up. If they won't come to us, we'll go to them. Here you go. Two RTCs. Rapid fire chambers, extended barrel, full chocks, heat sensor sized tracers included. Hey, it can't hurt. Wish I had me one of these babies when I was in Nicaragua. Look, you sure you don't want me to come with you? I mean, what if there are a couple of hostiles on that ship? I'm the only one that's trained to handle it. Jennings, if I can locate this other ship's resources, I need you here to set it up from our side. Okay, happy huntin'. Alex, you readin' me? You're comin' in great, Giles. Your suit is reading fine. Giles, be careful. Ships got an A-390. How do we open it? Well, there should be a C cylinder attached underneath. Alex, the code sequence is 7-W-8-2-4. Look it up. All right. See anything? Nah, it's too dark. It's the damnedest thing I've ever seen. Alright, we've got it for you. Punch 25-delta-76. It opened. Goin' in. I'm not sure it looks like we've got water damage. Alex, I want a molecular read out the moment we actually step inside. Please hurry, we're almost out of air. Oh, Christ look at this. Auxiliary lines. Alex, you got a reading yet? Yes, their oxygen level is fine. All other compounds are normal except for a high level of sulfur. The temperature is a 106. That's impossible they don't have any power. Okay. We're gonna go find the bridge now. Wait a minute. What is it? Check the monitor on your suit, Giles. I'm getting some interference. Atmospherics are goin' crazy! What the? This is weird. How's that? Wait a minute it's changing back. What did you do? Used a little high tech ingenuity. We're moving on. Flynn, over here. Flynn, don't touch anything yet. How do we know it's compatible? It's a U.S. ship, isn't it? I'm concerned about air quality. Flynn, we know nothing about that ship. Who knows what could've gotten into their air supply. Paxton, we don't have much choice. Alex said the air in here is fine. That was a crude atmospheric analysis at best. Well, we're gonna have to roll the dice on this one. It's in. Anything happenin' over there yet? We're all breathing a bit easier, thanks. The fuel tanks are empty. Then what was she flyin' on? Better yet who the hell was flying her? There was a NASA flight crew on this ship. It couldn't be. NASA hasn't been flying for 30 years. This is weirder than the Flying Dutchman. Alex, are you getting any imbalances around me? You alright? Everything checks out okay. I don't know I thought I saw something. Keep your eyes on the monitor, okay. Core samples from Centrus B-40? What the hell would they want with these? Giles, where are you? Cargo bay. Well, the molecular structure is changing again. Is there an air vent or a heating duct nearby? I don't know we're standing in the middle of the goddamn room. Well, look around you, Giles. Something is changing it. Jesus, Alex, are you sure there's not a damn thing in here except for us? Giles, if you're in cargo bay, you may be getting an exhaust feed from above. I took this mission because I wanted to relax, and I figured a bandage here or there. Jesus. A lot of good this did him. Alex, could you bring the tray over here please? Yeah. Oh. Looks like a knife cut him. Uh, no, a knife wouldn't cauterize. What about a laser? No. The cut would be deeper. Perhaps it was suicide? Well, I won't rule it out. You said he was hanging from the rafters. Perhaps he got caught up in the fall. Why would he dock the ship and then kill himself? I'm a doctor not a detective. Maybe there's someone else on the ship? Jennings, I want you to give me a hand. We're gonna seal off that airlock. I'm with you on that. What the? Well, looks like we'll be getting some heat. Let me know when you guys come up with somethin', huh? Mm-hmm. I'll be up in the computer room. What is it? I'm going to access Lesli. May I ask why? Let's just say I need to talk to her. Hello, Paxton. Hello, Lesli. Um, Lieutenant Giles is here to ask you a few questions. What is his clearance code please? B306. Paxton, Lieutenant Giles does not have security clearance to access my files. Why not? Well, it's a security override that I added to the system. Purely, a precaution. Paxton, nobody authorized you to do that. Get rid of it. I'll need Paxton's verification on that. She's seeing if I'm lying. How can I help you, Lieutenant? I need to ask you a few questions about Discovery. What would you like to know first? What's their objective? What are they doing up you in space? To collect core samples from Centrus B-40. Do you have a Michael C. Gotier as a registered employee of the space program? Negative. Well, we found him on the ship. That doesn't correlate with current data. List all current information on Lieutenant Colonel William T. Marks. William T. Marks has no profile in the current space program. You said the same about Lieutenant Gotier. How could they be up in space and you have not have a record of it, Lesli? They were never registered in the current space program. Alex, anything new? Workin' on it, Giles. I'm with Lesli if you need anything. Mm-hmm. Okay, let's get back to Discovery 18 for a moment. Who was the last company that owned her? NASA. What year was that? 1992. Did they sell the ship to another company? Negative. The ship was registered lost after an emergency splashdown. Can you explain? Discovery initiated an unscheduled maximum power decent from Centrus B-40. The crew was forced to make an emergency landing as a result of multiple malfunctions during reentry. Okay, where exactly was that splashdown? 126 miles from the Florida coast between Bermuda and Miami. Bermuda Triangle? Goddamn. All right. Anything wants to get through that door is gonna have to move around 5,000 pounds. Come on. What happened to her crew? Two of the three were recovered. What were the names of the two recovered? Captain Blake Schadwell, Lieutenant Colonel William T. Marks. What was the name of the astronaut not recovered? Michael C. Gotier. What'd you find out? Well, there's no foreign virus. C count appears normal. There's no plasma obstruction. For want of a better word, he checks out normal. Yeah, except for a huge hole in the middle of his stomach. This is the weirdest suicide I've ever seen. It was not a suicide. Every sharp instrument leaves some metallic residue. But the wound is absolutely sterile. And the shape of it it's a perfect triangle, and I mean perfect. There's no way it's self inflicted. Alright, can I see a graph of Centrus B-40, please? Now visualize the Bermuda Triangle. And give me an indicator light of Discovery splashdown. Now draw a line from Discovery's location on the moon to their splashdown area. Where is Spacecore One in relation to all this? Jesus. Shit. Alex! No! Somebody help me! No! Somebody help me! Help! Yell as loud as you want. No one can hear you. Who are you? What do you want? I have many names. And I've come to take what is mine. At last, the day of reckoning is upon you all. No, no! No! No! You belong to me now. Alex! Here's wisdom. Let him that hath understanding count the number of my name. Alex! Everyone to medical now! No, well, just wait a minute. What are you doing let go of me! She's hurt! Nobody is goin' in there. What is it? Gotier is not dead. What are you talking about? He got off the table, and he came after Alex. Bullshit, man, you're losin' it. Let me in there. You do that again and I'll kick your ass. I don't care what rank you are. Look take it easy, Jennings. I'm just tellin' you what I saw. Giles, we just can't keep standing around. Now what is it that you propose we do? Just wait a minute. Let me go in there first, okay? Let him go. He's flipped. He's completely flipped. Calm down. No, he's nuts. He looks pretty dead to me, Giles. He had his hands right around her throat. How's she doin'? She's unconscious. Maybe she took a fall? You know what, you guys aren't listenin' to me. She didn't take a goddamn fall! I saw him pull her face inside his stomach! He wouldn't let me out of the computer room. He was lookin' right at me? Who? Who was looking at you? Gotier. We'll let the doc handle this. Jennings, I need you to give me a hand with the body. We're gonna take him down to vaporization. Uh-uh, I ain't goin' in there. That guy's fuckin' crazy. Get your ass in here. Paxton, I want you to check the circuit tracers. All right. Hey, come on, come on. If we don't get those thrusters up, we're gonna be meeting the man on the moon in person. Listen, I'm gonna tell you this as a friend. What you've been saying is just a little hard to swallow. We've all suffered a sustained lack of oxygen, and we've all been under a bit of pressure. Gotier went into her. I saw it. Alright, then let me tell you something as your doctor. You take a breather. There's nothing you can do here. Now look I'll run some tests. See what I can find out. Okay? Okay. Just promise me one thing. Don't undo the straps. Alright, I promise. Dreyfuss, I know what I'm talkin' about. I said I promise. Okay, Lesli. Let's pick up where we left off. Give me a visual history of all the disappearances in the Triangle. Maybe we'll find a pattern. The year 1502 the vessel Gallipo lost, 16 men onboard. The year 1926 the Japanese tanker Maya lost, 100 men onboard. The year 1945. Okay, I get the point. Lesli, is there any logical explanation for Discovery's disappearance into the Bermuda Triangle? No logical explanation exists. Alright, forget about logic. How about speculation? That an undefined energy of massive proportion has the ability to seize as random any object and transport it without detection to an unknown destination. Could this be directed by an alien possibly from some different dimension or galaxy? There has never been any contact with alien life forms in the space program thus far. Giles, come on down here. Something's happening with Alex. Oh, god. Oh, my god. What is it? Oh, well a couple of minutes ago her heart started racing, so I gave her 200 milligrams of Verapamil. Here look at this. This is 280 beats a minute. I mean her blood pressure is so high, she could explode a tire. What's goin' on? I don't know look. No wait. This is wrong. Set position indicator. No, no, no, this is wrong. Tracking is true. She's back. She's back to normal. Well, what's wrong with that? It's medically impossible. The human anatomy is not meant to withstand the heartbeat of a hummingbird. She should be dead. She's still unconscious. Talk to me what just happened here? Well, possibly a severe seizure or a very bizarre cardiac arrest, a series of aneurysms. To tell you the truth I don't have a clue. Well, I do. There's somethin' inside of her. You still think I'll crazy! Keep the straps on her. Nobody comes in this room until we find out more. There's somethin' about Discovery you should know. Bullshit. Come on that ship splashed down the Bermuda Triangle.. 30 years ago. What's it doin' up in space? Look, there's no way that ship took a splash into the Atlantic. It's a typical computer error, Giles. Look we don't have time to be dickin' around with this. We got bigger programs. Thrusters are still malfunctioning. Then how do you explain Alex? I don't. But we're not gonna get any answers unless we get this baby moving. Okay, it has to be a relay block. They're not gettin' the message to fire up. I have Jennings checking on 'em now. Anyway I have to see what I can salvage from this other ship. If it's our relays that are nonfunctional, maybe we can use theirs. Wait a minute you're not goin' back on that ship? Will you cut it out with this sci-fi bullshit. We need the goddamn relays. But even if you find them, it might be completely outdated. We don't have much of a choice. Our orbit is getting tighter and tighter. We're less than a thousand miles from the surface. If we don't get this ship moving, we impact in 13 hours. Alright, then I'm going with you. No, I need you to stay here to run the compatibilities once I find them. It'll save us some time. Giles, are you reading me? Yeah, Flynn, go ahead. I'm going into their computer now. Anything? I'm still checking. Come on where are you guys? Bingo, I found the geo relay system. Giles, I'm headed for the third level. Roger. Hey, you wanna hear somethin' for real. I locked into the satellite, a little reprogramming to change its orbit, and so telephone home. Jennings we don't have three days for somebody to get up here. It's worth a try, Giles. Flynn, what is it? What is it, Flynn? Geez, it's like a goddamn fish tank in here. Salt water. Salt water. Seaweed, shit, everywhere. What the hell is salt water doin' on this ship? Flynn, get out of there! Everything's rusty. Hey, I see the relays. Flynn, get out of there now! What is it? What the hell are you doin' here? Flynn! Oh, Jesus, let me go! Flynn! Son of a bitch. What is it? Come with me. Something's in there. No shit. Giles, no wait! No. I can't get the hatch opened! There's gotta be another way inside. Find it! What happened? I felt something. What did you fire at? I don't know. I had this feeling. I just fired. You were in here first. Where were you all this time? Dreyfuss. Now don't get weird on me. Okay? Let's go find Flynn. What the hell does this? I knew you'd come. Come closer. I've always wanted you. You have what I desperately desire. There are things I can give you beyond your wildest dreams. My god. It's just like Gotier. Alex. Yes. Yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yeah. Yeah. Yes. At last, you have weakened. Now you belong to me. Forever. Get to medical. So much blood. Remember he had so much blood. Goddamn you, Jennings! You let it out didn't you? You fuckin' let it out! No, I just got here. I just came down to see how she was doin'. The door was opened. I went in and saw her. Triangle. What is it? What's goin' on? You opened the door and that's all it took. What in the hell are you talking about? Where the hell were you? Are you accusing me of this? I've had just about enough of your insanity. Alright, just hold it, Paxton. Flynn is dead too. Oh, my god. Captain? Yes. Where was he? On the other ship. Captain. The other ship? Ooh. Alright, everybody up to the bridge. Jennings. It's okay come on. Now. Ooh, ooh take it easy. Now! Whoa, whoa! Take it easy. Paxton, hand it over. Not on your life. And it very well may come to that. You know something, Giles, I've been thinking. While we were here, working very hard I might add, you were on that other ship. Yeah, where Flynn was killed. Hey, wait a minute this clip's empty. Figures. What happened on the other ship? I don't know. I don't, really. I just felt something so I fired. What was it? What was it? Goddamn it, Jennings. I don't know man. I don't know either just take it easy. That's right. Because he wasn't there we got separated. Separated? Long enough for him to double back and kill Alex? I don't know. I didn't kill Alex or anyone else. Do it, waste the motherfucker. Go ahead kill him! Go ahead he was there with Flynn when they found Gotier. That's why he wasted Flynn. Go ahead! Look just because I was there does not mean that I did it. Precisely, we can't be sure it was anyway of us. Any one of us could be innocent or guilty. Lieutenant Giles, say hello to your judge, jury, and executioner. Jesus, don't shoot him! Do it, whack the motherfucker. I didn't kill anybody. If you really think it was me, then you shoot me. Go ahead. Well, you might as well shoot us all. Okay, Lesli. Let's take another look at those lost ships. There must be over 500 vessels listed as lost. 665 to be exact. Lucky us. We would be 666. That is correct. Leave the triangle and remove all the numerals and graphics. Give me the longitude and latitude of each point on the triangle. Remove all numerals other than six. 6-6-6. The Holy Bible book of Revelations 13:18: 6-6-6 the mark of the beast. Mark of the beast. Transition avionics secure from file. Where have you been? I was with Lesli. Well, what'd you find out? We're on our own. So what are we gonna do now? We still have a couple of hours left before we impact. So, I'm gonna go on Discovery and get her relays. Say what? Jennings, we gotta get the ship moving. Now while I'm gone I want you guys to stay together. I don't want us to leave one another's sight. You gotta be kiddin' me now. Giles, I hate to bring this up. But with nobody watching you, how can we be sure that you won't disconnect and leave us stranded? If I'm not back in 30 minutes, disengage Discovery blow her up. Wait! Whoa, we can't do that. Yes, we can. The satellite. We lock in Discovery's coordinates. Then after a little drift she'll get a nice nuclear blast. No. I'll show you. Verify helix angle. Lock Polaris as in. Recon rotation complete. She's all ready. Now we just push this key here. The ships will disengage. Goodbye, Discovery. Give me 30 minutes. If I'm not back, seal off the airlock and disengage. Giles, these ships separate, they'll be no coming back. Give me a mark at 30. Three, two, one, mark. I just got this feeling that whatever it was got him. Let's just start the disengagement process now. Nobody's gonna do anything! He said 30 minutes god dammit, and he's gonna get it. He has five more minutes! Two minutes, Paxton, two minutes! We agreed on 30 minutes time is up. We're gonna give him five minutes more. You're out of your mind let's do it. Jennings, Jennings he's right. He gave me an order! I said five more minutes. No! Missile lock engaged Armed: All warheads. It's not gonna get in here, you understand? You all are gonna thank you for what I just did. You son of a bitch. Target acquisition designated activated. He should be letting that old dog know any moment now. You know Paxton you really surprised me. Back where I come from that would've been a legit court martial dishonorable discharge, bear press and the paper, the whole fuckin' deal. Believe me, gettin' rid of him and that ship is the best move we could've made. Paxton? What the fuck's wrong with you? The ship's airlock has been breached. What's happenin'? What the hell's happenin'? You don't have the guts to use that thing. Why don't you put it down? And kneel before me. Who the hell are you? What do you want from me? Fate it is in the hands of God. But I control your destiny. I'm losing my fuckin' mind. Oh, yes, to me, and I will take what is mine. Open the hatch! I can't! Open the hatch! I can't! Stay the fuck away from me. Put that down. Paxton, back off. I swear to God I'll use this! That's right swear to god. But he can't help you now. You belong to me, you weak spineless bastard. If you have the courage to shoot me, go ahead shoot. Pull the trigger. You can, you can do it. Pull the trigger. No! Yes! Shoot me. Shoot. Shoot! I told you I'd use it. I told you I'd use it you stupid son of a bitch. Jesus. What have I done? Synchronize target lock to TARS. What took you so long? Confidence is high. I don't know. Somethin' was trying to keep me from gettin' back on the ship. Eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. Zoom. Secondary target has been neutralized. Thanks, I owe you one. Jennings, Paxton? Jennings, Paxton? Shit. Poor bastard. Alright, listen to me. It was in Paxton. Now it's in Jennings. And we got one hour left. Let's put these relays in, and try to get home, alright? Damn. Get away from me, you motherfucker. What is it? It's what's left of the relay system. (Foreign language) Save the prayers, huh? What's your problem? Prayers don't mean jack shit. They do for me! Whoa! Get down! Alright, now there's only two choices. Either he gets us, or we get him. Don't be afraid to use this. Alright, let's go. Oh, my god. Discovery blew up you should be dead. Just do it, man. Just fuckin' do it. Shit. My god. You okay? He was gonna kill you. Thanks. What's going on? It stopped. Lesli, give me a status update. Lesli? Lesli? Lesli, it's Giles. Yes, Giles, how may I help you. Give me a status update. The ship has come to a complete stand still. Explain. Reason unknown. At least it gives us more time, huh, Giles? Something wrong? No, I was just thinking. About what? Well, I think, there's a way that we can still get home. Really? How's that? Jennings figured out a way to reprogram into the satellite, send a message to Houston. It's worth a shot, right? True. Lock Polaris as in. Recon rotation complete. You don't believe in God, do you Giles? That's strange. You believe in me. I should've known. Why the Bermuda Triangle? Let's just call it convenient. Heaven is a universe but so is hell. When God cast me from the heavens, I vowed one day I would become more powerful than he. Every soul I take strengthens me 100 fold. Every life I destroy lays claim to one more piece of heaven till heaven is nothing more than a crucible filled with dust which I will break in witness of your creator. You don't think I believe that shit, do you? What good is wisdom if it gives no power to the wise? The moment you questioned your faith your soul was mine. You will kneel before me! You had a choice. You all had a choice. No, I still have a choice. Missile lock engaged. Armed: All warheads. Maybe I can't destroy you. But if it's God's will, then so be it. Confidence is high. Time. And if not, then I'll see you in hell. Six, four, three, two, one, zoom. Mayday, Mayday. This is Captain Louis Ramser, of the spaceship Tiberius. Mayday, Mayday. We have lost all power. I'm transmitting on auxiliary. Mayday, Mayday. We are drifting towards Centrus B-40. Mayday, Mayday.
