Lie down there, there. Master, Master. What happened? Marco is dead. I want that lioness, I want her. Here she is. What's her name again? Caprice. I would like to shake hands with Caprice. Put her on the back stage. Bad time now Nikita, she's about to be fed. Well so much the better. She'll show more life, more fire. Put here on a stage. Alright you're own risk. Alright. Boys come on. Master, wait at least until she has been fed. Oh go and watch monkey. Caprice, she is beautiful, Caprice. Get me a chair. Nikita you know what you're doing? Sure I do, open the door. Stop, stop, don't go in. Don't go in she'll kill you. Who is she? Marco's daughter. Poor dear, don't be afraid darling. She wouldn't do anything to me. You must go now Lida and let Madam pack. I'd want to go to an orphanage. I told you yesterday I don't want to go. Marco leaves her. No, orphanage is not the place for Marco's daughter. You don't want to go to an orphanage do you? No Monsieur. Would you rather go with me to Paris? Yes Monsieur. Well go and pack your things. But master we... Shut up. Nikita, you're wonderful. Goodbye Marie, I will take good care of her. Bye. Lida I brought you your milk. What is the matter, you are crying? Look I brought you your milk. You must be a brave little girl. Remember your father used to give performance. Daddy, my poor daddy. It's very sad. But I'll take care of you. I'll take care of you as long as I live. That's going to be a long time. I will try to be a father to you. I cannot be more. Don't cry. Don't cry. Now have some milk. That's a good girl. Now drink, that's it. Now drink. More more more more more. That's it's, drink, that's it. More more more. More. That's a good girl, that's a good girl. Now, now sleep. Oh please don't take him. No no no, it's not a time to play. It's a time to sleep. Goodnight. Gerald, Gerald. This is Gerald, very funny monkey. Pietro, go get Caprice. Yes Master. Hello Nikita. Hello Katia. I hear you're a family man now. Yes, you see. Lida, this is Katia. Shake hands. There she is. Well Lida now I'm going into arena to do my act. You wait for me right here under this clock. Yes Monsieur. Then when I come back I'll know where to find you. And don't talk to anybody. If somebody will be talking to you, just answer for that. Nikita did a grand thing. He's got a good heart alright. How's Caprice? Alright. Now remember what I told you. Don't move from here, I'll be exactly 18 minutes. Yes Monsieur. Ladies and gentlemen tonight I will present for your entertainment one of the most staggering, one of the most sensational events in the history of animal training. How fresh in your memories must be the tragedy of last Wednesday night at the Circus Rambou where that magnificent Nubian lioness Caprice attacked and killed her keeper. This would be Caprice's first appearance since that gruesome tragedy. Now then ladies and gentlemen tonight in my own circus our own Nikita the Fearless will enter the cage and break down the spirit of this ferocious Queen of the Beasts. Ladies and gentlemen, Caprice. On your place. Too smart for Marco, now you've met your match. Hello. How are you? I'm alright thank you. Still the same. Same tender smile. Of course you're coming to my party tonight? I'm sorry but I can't come. And why not? I've arranged it specially for you. Don't you ever get tired of standing under this old clock? You know one of these nights I'm going to come along and put a bomb inside it and blow it to pieces. Then where will Nikita put you? Get it, get in. Why did you talk to this man? I couldn't help it Nikita he came over. I told you many times not to talk to these people. I know but... I don't want you to mix up with them. Did you hear that? Yes he makes me sick. Oh Nikita, I'd like to speak with your for a moment. Alright. Alone. Alone? Yes just for a moment. Alright Lida wait for me here. Lida. Why do you want to see me alone? Well Lida needn't know our private business. Alright shoot. I hardly know how to explain. It's like this Nikita. What we need in this Circus is an attraction that appeals to women. What do you mean? Don't I appeal to women? Of course you do, you don't understand. But you appeal to the gallery, to the men. What we really need is a matinee item. You talk about Trelawney? That cheap magician who pulls rabbits out of the hat. Where has he ever headlined outside of a tent show? Nevermind he packs them in. The women adore him. If I can play him here Lady Pilcott will buy a box for the season. Whatever that woman does, every woman in her set follows. Now listen Krone, let's understand one another. I am not headlining with Trelawney. I've got a contract with him. Well then cancel it alright. There is going to be only one star in this circus, and that is Nikita. Keep that in your mind. Awe come on now let's go, everybody's waiting for you. No I can't really. Oh now please. Now listen young man. I don't want you to talk to Lida anymore. Keep away from her. Why should I? Because I tell you to. You talk like a husband. She's not your wife. Hey what's the matter with you, you crazy? Get out of here. Stop you, go on out the building. Lida. I want you to fire him. Fire him, you're crazy. If I fired every man around the circus in love with Lida I wouldn't have any circus left. It's about time that you realize that Lida is a grown up woman. It's only natural that men should run after her. Oh I suppose Papa Krone is right. You don't realize Lida is a pretty girl now. So you really think she's really pretty? Who's there? It's me Lida. It's dark in here. Lida, I want to talk to you something very important. It's about that young gaucho that was annoying you. He wasn't annoying me. Well alright he wasn't annoying you but he was talking to you wasn't he? You like him? Oh no, he doesn't mean anything to me. But he's a nice boy and I'm sorry you hit him. Well perhaps I was little bit too rough with him but you see you've been with me all these years and I've got always to protect you. Especially now you're not a child any longer. That's what they say. You're a young beautiful woman. They say that too, and they are right, they are right. See I never noticed all these things before but I'm noticing them now, and I don't want anyone to take you away from me. Well who would take me away from you? Well you want to get married don't you? Married, I never thought of it. Well neither did I but supposing it happens. What should I do then? I can't imagine this house without you, only two plates at the table instead of three, coming into this room and not to find you. Is there anyone else you like besides the boy I hit? No, I mean only you and Pietro. Would you like to marry Pietro? No of course not. How you would like to marry me? You? Yes yes well I knew it would be a surprise for you. But I've decided it's the best thing for me and the best thing for you. I can't let you go Lida. I will make you happy I know. Why do you keep quiet? I don't know what to say. Well I've always been nice to you haven't I? And I will be even nicer after I am your husband. Husband. Yes yes but nothing will change. You'll be the mistress of this house and you'll have everything you want. I can't let you go Lida. I'll make you happy I know. You've never been unhappy all these years you've been here have you? No. I'm very very grateful to you. Well then it's settled, Lida, Lida. Well that's all I wanted to find out. Lida you're tired, well you go to bed. You got to bed like a nice little girl. Nikita do you take this woman to be your lawful wedded wife? I do. Lida do you take this man to be your lawful wedded husband? I do. My dear children of the circus world, for after all we are one great family, and I'm proud to be known to you as Father Krone. Many of you here tonight, now world famous, started your careers under me, and I love you all as a father. My friends we are congregated here tonight to celebrate the wedding of two of the most beloved of our family, Nikita the Fearless and Lida the Lovely. It's the climax of a glorious romance. Speech, speech. Oh no no no. Come on Master, just a few words. Come on speech, speech, speech. My dear friends I really never in my life spoken before so many people. I feel much more at home with my whip in my hands. The greatest pleasure an artist can have is to take a bow after his act. And that, that's the way I feel now. Even much more so when I look at my dear, beautiful wife Lida and when I realize that from now on I have full right to protect her. And there is no power in the whole world that can take that right away from me. Even Papa Krone. Wait a minute, wait a minute. My friends I am drinking this toast to my beautiful wife Lida and to a long life with... What's he doing there? He's here to congratulate you. I don't want his congratulations. Now just a moment please, just a moment. It's awful to be so late. So good of you to come. - Good evening. - How are you? Lord and Lady Pilcott may I present my great family of artists, of course most of you know Trelawney. Nikita you know Trelawney. Yes yes I know Trelawney. What about that promise you made me? Come on outside we'll talk about it. Wait a minute, you wait for me here. Oh he's so amazing. Now really that's quite perfect for a lovely bride. So lovely that I'd love to dance with you. Will you? Oh no, no thank you, my husband told me to wait here. Oh don't listen to that, you must train your husband the way he should go. Please. Come on. How beautifully you dance. I won't stand for it. Wait a minute wait. Now come here now, now come here Nikita. Come listen to reason. Now what difference can Trelawney a magician make to a lion tamer like you? You look lovely in that wedding dress. 'Til this moment I didn't know what envy was. I envy Nikita, what a lucky man he is. And you are to be envied too you know. Why? Isn't love the most wonderful thing in the world? Why did you run away? Have I said something to offend you? I'll never forgive myself if I have, tonight of all nights. Monsieur Trelawney, it's nothing you have said. But you're crying? You are the only one who has seen it. I don't want anyone to know, please forget. On my word of honor I'll never mention it to a soul. Thank you. And he won't star? Absolutely that is definitely so. When I come back it won't make any difference. Definitely not. Where is Lida? Where is she? Well Clyde you are a clever magician. Why? You seemed to make young women disappear, the happy bride too. I was only showing her one of my tricks. Well you come along and show me one of your tricks. Here you are. Where have you been? Shy little bride, waiting for her husband under the clock. Let's go home, let's give everybody the slip. The two I love best, you and Caprice. Welcome Monsieur Nikita. Hello. Master. Where is Krone? Please Monsieur if you don't prepare now you'll be late for the act. Don't worry dear, Krone will fix it. Get me Krone. Yes Master. Lida. If you see Krone stop him. Tell him I want to see him just as soon as I come back. I'll get that dressing room by tomorrow, you'll see. Hello. Hello. I'm so glad you're back. Yes. Safe under the clock again? How did you know? I asked about you. I wanted to find out everything about you I possibly could. Why? Because I've been thinking about you far more than's been good of my piece of mind. You wish me luck? Of course. Hey Trelawney while I was away you took my dressing room. Mister Krone gave me the dressing room, you'd better see him about it. Ladies and gentlemen the great Trelawney. Ladies and gentlemen observe these chains. They're the exact duplicates of those used on Devil's Island for dangerous criminals. I invite any lady or gentleman in the audience to come down and fetter me with these chains. And if it's a lady I'd prefer a blonde. Around the neck. And you lock it. All I need is a dog kennel and some biscuits and I'm alright, now this one here. Step round the body. Now pull it tight both of you, come on you're strong boys, come on take the end of it. That's alright now help me up on the horse come on. Lida, what a delight to see you back again. Now listen Krone, you double crossed me. You gave Trelawney my dressing room. Now this is not time or place to discuss these matters. I'll talk this over with your tomorrow. You'll talk over this with me today. I want my room back, my dressing room. Alright I'll speak to Trelawney about it. What do you mean you'll speak to Trelawney about it? The dressing room belongs to me. Trelawney's the star. He's entitled to the star dressing room. That's just it, you have made him the star. You had no right to do it, you gave me your word. I must look after my business. Don't worry about your business. Now that I am back we'll be packing them through the doors. You don't have to have Trelawney any longer. Kick him out. Oh take it easy, take it easy, sit down. Now you listen to me. I'm gonna be quite frank with you. When I engaged Trelawney I didn't tell you the real reason. What was the real reason? Well I didn't want to spoil your wedding and your honeymoon trip. What was the real reason? Business is bad, very bad. And it got worse at every performance. It was the weather. It wasn't the weather it was you. What? Me? Now we're not gonna mince matters any further. Your name on the bill doesn't draw them in more. Buster you been doing the same old trick for eight years. Public's tired of it, you gotta brush up your act. While you were away not one person inquired at the box office when you were coming back, not one. Don't talk loud. I don't want my wife to hear it. Well it's tough to tell you this old man but there it is. So they don't want me anymore? They are tired of my old tricks. Well life's like that. They want something new. Listen Krone years ago when I was a young fella I always dreamt of doing something new with a lion. Some new trick that had never been done before. You know what I'm going to do? What? You see, the lion is always afraid of a man's eyes. Yes I know about that. But more than this, more than this he's afraid of the man's hands. You know what I'm going to do? I will walk into the cage with Caprice without my hands. My hands will be tied behind my back. Handcuffed, huh? Well no one can do a trick like that. I'll do the trick. I'll do it, I'll get my dressing room back. What you care about a dressing room if you can do a trick like that? I live in the dressing room I'm talking about. Caprice, the stubborn beast, she sprang at me again. Well just be patient Nikita, you might get it tomorrow. I'll get it tomorrow, I'll get it. Master, I've been with you for a long time haven't I? Yeah. I have never asked you to do me a favor. You want one now, what is it? Master, please don't do that new trick with Caprice. What? Don't do it, I know Papa Krone told you to go ahead. But he's not risking his life. He doesn't know what we both know. That the trick is impossible. So you don't think I can do it? Of course of course you can. You can do anything. Just don't do it, I beg of you. But you promised me not to be angry. I'm sorry. Nikita, Pietro is right. He's always right. He says it's impossible to do the trick. I'm going to do it. Up, up, up you are. Caprice, Caprice, the stand, the stand. Attention. Attention Caprice. Look he's got it. Back, back, Caprice to your cage, to your cage. I got it, I got it, Lida did you see it? Yes sir where is Krone? Alright Lida you go home. I'll see you later I've got to find Krone. Oh Krone I've got the trick. What trick? I went handcuffed in the cage with Caprice and she did everything I told her. Not really? Yes. Well I congratulate you, I never though you'd do it. I know it but I told you I would. Now we can include the skit in our program. Wait a minute now, wait a minute. Trelawney's still packing them in. We don't want to include your act with his wonderful act. Oh forget about Trelawney. I'll tell you what I'll do. I'll introduce your act on the night Trelawney closes. But I'm ready to do it now, tonight. You'll do it on the night he closes understand. Besides I've got to see your act first. Get that into your head. Hello Varnia. Hello Mr. Nikita. How do you feel? Oh fine, I brought you a little wedding present. It's nice but it's too good. Oh you're crazy take it back. Oh please. Look. Very interesting. How do you like it dear? Lovely. Master you'll be late. Thanks old man, thanks. Lida put it in the dressing room. See you later. Thank you Varnia. Hello, we're off. Hello. What do you got there? A present. Oh what a nice little clock. Didn't I hear it chiming just now? Yes. Where are you taking it? To show it to Jack. Who is Jack? One of my doves, look they're in there, Jack and Jill. You met Jack at your wedding party. Wouldn't you like to go in and meet Jill? No I mustn't. Now what difference could eight little steps make in your life? Come on. And here we are. Oh how sweet. Jill I want you to meet Lida, an obedient little wife just like you are. How do you do? You see when Jack does his act in the arena, Jill waits for him under that lump of sugar. Tell me Jack, does she never fly away? She's never been tempted. Your eyes are beautiful when you smile like that. I should go. No not yet we must celebrate your first entrance into my dressing room. Oh but I've been here before. But while not I've been it. And here's hoping it won't be the last. I must go. Oh no, just a minute. I want to show you my magic blackboard. Is this something new? Yes, and you're going to be the first person who's going to see it, that's a great honor. Now you stay here and imagine that I'm the head master and you're the pupil. Now attention in class please. Watch the blackboard. That's wonderful. Look again. Why don't you get dressed Nikita? You've been through for 15 minutes you know. Get dressed and let's go home. Now I hear a finish. Who is it? Nikita. Come in. Trelawney I want to talk to you about your entrance music. Yes? It starts much too soon. Tonight I've could have taken two more calls but the orchestra started. My dear fellow I'll attend to it at once. I had no idea, I'm terribly sorry. It's been going for the whole week. I'll see to it right away I promise you. Well see that it doesn't happen again. How did that clock get here? I found it. Why is it yours? Where did you find it? On the drum at the bottom of the stairs just now when I came off from my act. Lida. Lida. Come in here. Come in please. Good evening. How did that clock get here? I don't know. Where did you leave it? I left it downstairs on the drum. Don't leave things downstairs on the drum anymore. Good evening. Is everything alright? Does Nikita suspect anything? No but you must be careful. If he knew about yesterday, he'd kill you. You shouldn't be talking to me here. But I must talk to you, Lida I know now you mean more to me then anything in the world. Do you know that? From the depths of my heart. Dearest I'm longing to hold you in my arms again. That can never happen. Lida don't say that, please don't. I'm afraid, afraid for you. See what the papers will say tomorrow. There are three photographers out front waiting for me. For me, not for Trelawney, Trelawney. Magician on a horse, wait 'til they see the real act. Did you see Papa Krone? Yes he's very busy in the box office. How's the house? Sold out. You see? And you both wanted to stop me. How's Caprice? When I fed her tonight she was very quiet. That's a good sign. How does this look? Fine. You'd better not Nikita. Why not? There is nothing wrong with one. Here is to Caprice. Good luck. Nikita are you nervous? Nervous why? Everything is great isn't it? I'll tell them, come on let's go. Pietro I don't need you for the beginning of the act. Go and watch Caprice. Yes Master. Nikita. Good luck my boy. Thank you Papa. I must see you alone. No. Lida it's my last night here. Please be careful. I've got to see you alone, I must. It is impossible. There's no such word as impossible when two people love each other. You mustn't stay here, Pietro suspects us. I know he does. I don't care who suspects us. I'll wait for you upstairs. I mustn't stay, I only came to say goodbye. Just a few minutes, please. Look I'm afraid Nikita might find out. But it's 18 minutes, an eternity. 18 minutes for me to look at you and listen to your voice. Quiet quiet, quiet quiet quiet, quiet Caprice. I think Nikita must be crazy to go handcuffed in a cage with her. I know. Lida I fell in love with you the first time I saw you, the first time I kissed you, you remember? Oh why did I let you go away from me then? Don't talk about it now. But Lida I can't live without you. Come away with me. Don't think about anything just think how happy you're gonna be with me. No, we'll never see each other again. But you love me, I know you do. I want to hear you say it, tell me. Tell me you love me, tell me. Yes. Go on boys. Have you seen Lida? Jacques have you seen Lida? Yeah. Oh please fetch her, tell her to come here. Oh you fetch here, I'm no killjoy. What do you mean? Trelawney? Ladies and gentlemen and now will follow the sensational sensation. Our own Nikita will enter the cage of Caprice unattended, unprotected by spear or pistol, manacled, Nikita. Master, please don't do it tonight. Awe you're crazy. I beg of you, don't do it tonight. Shut up. Bring her out. Quickly the handcuffs. Master you mustn't. Get on with your job, the handcuffs. Master you mustn't go on. Shut up. Master, Master. Your wife is in Trelawney's room. What? It's true, it's true. Your wife is in Trelawney's room. Stop, stop, stop it. Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up. What is all of this, are you crazy? Get back to the ring where you belong. Why'd you do it? Don't you hear them out there? You want to disgrace yourself and ruin me? They're tearing up my circus. Why did you do this? Listen Nikita you're an old trooper. They're waiting for you. Whatever else happens you can't let them down. Why did you do this? Nikita I can't help it, I love him. Lida, Lida I didn't know. Lida, Lida it's not true. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen for 40 years I have been you servant. Have I ever broken faith with you? No! Has Nikita ever disappointed you? Many tragedies occur in the lives of us in the circus out there in our private lives of which you know nothing. I'm not going to plead for Nikita. But I ask you if are sportswomen, if you are sportsmen, you will give Nikita a chance to continue, yes. Nikita, Nikita!
