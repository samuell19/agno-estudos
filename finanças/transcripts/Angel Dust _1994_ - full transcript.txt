Monday, September 19, 17:55 Next stop, Shibuya Station. How far are we going? Just a bit further. A bit further? What is there? Nothing. That's the great thing. Unlike with climbing a mountain, there is no destination. It's bottomless. The inside of Mt. Fuji is full of cavities formed by hardened lava. What's that sound? Is it the wind? It's the Siren. She's calling to those who are lost. People have been led astray by her since long ago. You're trembling? I'm okay. A suicide... Could be murder. Look at the ice-pick! - Whichever it may be, it's an unsolved case. - Let's go back! Can you find your way back? Tomoo? Tomoo? Tomoo? Excuse me... it seems urgent. A call for you. Ms. Suma, are you a fashion model? A rush job, perhaps?! Monday, September 26, 18:00 Hamamatsucho... Hamamatsucho... SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM FILE YAMANOTE LINE, MULTIPLE HOMICIDE CASE She's from our Science Department. She'll cooperate with us during our investigation. I'm Dr. Setsuko Suma, an expert on abnormal criminal personalities. Contrary to her looks she's extremely efficient. You must all be familiar with her contributions on Case 28. Those are your partners: Banba and Ashida. I dressed her as you requested. As you expected, there are no signs to show that the victim struggled. The stab mark on the left side of the chest is the only external wound. It was as fatal as the sting of a bee. Was it rhodotoxin again? Direct cause of death was respiratory failure, triggered by acute toxicosis. The murder weapon is an injection needle... or something similar to that, at least 2.5 cm by 1 mm in size. The perpetrator injected the poison with it: the same method as with the first victim. This type of rhodotoxin can be found in an Azalea you can buy in a gardening goods store. Difficult case, huh? Excuse me... Did you know that a dead person's retina... records the last image he or she saw before they died? I hate Dazai; he's too sentimental. If what he said is true, then who needs the police? That's pure fiction. Is she psychic or something? Not exactly. She analyses the evidence... and immerses herself in it... assimilating the thoughts and emotions of the perpetrator. The killer stood in front of her and quietly waiched her die. If you were the perpetrator... - Me? - Who would you kill here? Wha... what are you saying? There were other young women around, so she wasn't a random victim. Something made him choose her. Even if it was random, there must have been some reason. It's the chief's decision. If these are "pleasure killings", then we can't prevent them. Your ideas are useful. THE SYRINGE KILLER STRIKES AGAIN 6 PM, YAMANOTE LINE Every available officer will aid the investigation. - It'll be war tomorrow. - It is tomorrow! No, thanks. When he's on a case, he stops smoking and drinking. I'm the opposite. Is there a full moon tonight? Yes, look at it. See? It's not full. See? It's chipped a little. Inspector Banba... On a moonlit night... there's a wounded camel in a desert somewhere, quietly waiting to die. If you passed by this camel, what would you do? Are you analysing me? I hate that. With sad eyes the camel pleads, "kill me." With my detective's eyes I'd say "think twice," and would try to persuade it. YAMANOTE LINE - MURDER SITE This is Shibuya Station, crowded with commuters. This is Shibuya Station, crowded with commuters. At 6 pm two Mondays ago, the first victim was found at this station. Today is the third Monday... will the killer strike again today? The murderer seems to be targeting young women. All the young women look very tense today. If you're a young woman and you're going out... please be extra cautious on the Yamanote train today. The "Monday Killer" is a werewolf?! I knew it! In the English language, "Monday" comes from "Moonday". The urge to attack people on a full moon was proven in the latest moon-tide research. They say the werewolf legends originate from that. That sounds logical. Even I feel like killing people on Mondays! So the killer is a pissed-off office worker, huh? Oh, it's almost time. That's a serious topic. Don't annoy people. Sorry for that. But if you were to strike, which one would you choose? Let me see... I'd probably... choose her. MURDER VICTIM: KAZUKO ODAWARA (AGE 20) The victim was a student living in Yoyogi. Kazuko Odawara, age 20. The autopsy report shows that a toxic substance was injected into her breast, using a syringe-like object. Despite the police's efforts to place numerous officers at all Yamanote Line stations, the killer boldly struck again, amidst the commuters and with the police on guard. The police are becoming increasingly concerned about the killings, which have all taken place on Yamanote line trains. They are appealing to the public to come forward if they can shed any light on the killings. Please try to recall where you were at the time of the crimes. Thank you. Are you all ready? Please listen carefully! Everybody here in this room should be a witness from Monday this week. Nobody here from Monday last week, or the week before? I made a mistake. Three, two, one... To your positions, please! Imagine, the train is moving in this direction. He's the perpetrator. I'll play the victim. Hey, who's whistling? Be serious! I was only recreating the scene. Inspector Ashida... what's the 'Re-freezing Psychorium'? The first victim was treated there. It's a clinic of some kind... deprogramming of former cult members. The victim was a follower of the 'Ultimate Truth Church'. You often see them at train stations. Are you happy? Her family requested deprogramming, to free her from the cult. We've examined it. There was trouble between the church and the clinic - we examined it thoroughly. She was the first victim. And? Neither the second nor the third victims had anything to do with it. I've already told you everything about Yumiko. The killer didn't mind who it was, as long as it was a young woman. Maybe... maybe not... But if it had to be Yumiko, then this could be the key. I need the details of the deprogramming your daughter received. There are no people in these photos. Thus Spake Zarathustra - Nietzsche Oh, yes. This is it... The Re-Freezing Psychorium. There's a person on this one. Aku... Rei... Akuryo? (evil spirit) The second victim, Masumi Takagi, was an art student. The three victims didn't know each other. There is no link between them. Not in their pasts either. But you attempt to find a psychological link between them? Yes. The three victims may have had some kind of common consciousness. The signals they were sending out... attracted the killer. Only Yumiko Asahi was into religion... but I feel a strong sense of isolation and destruction in all of them. What do we know about Kazuko Odawara? She was studying to be a nursery teacher... because she studied autism, she decided to act like an autistic child... and didn't speak for six months. You call that normal?! What do you suggest? Announce that young women with a feeling of destruction and isolation... must not ride trains at 6 pm on Mondays? Then even old women won't ride trains at that time! The second and third victims were both stabbed from the front. Only the first victim was stabbed in the back. Are you trying to tell me that the first victim knew the killer? I don't know... But I feel... that the first murder is the key to it all. You managed to get away? Did I wake you? Don't worry. I was watching this. 'Sleeping Beauty'. At the hospital today, a patient asked me whether I prefer a blue or a pink dress. I wondered why she asked that. It was because of 'Sleeping Beauty... For Princess Aurora's 16th birthday, the three fairies made plans to give her a dress, but two of the fairies quarrelled over what colour the dress should be. One wanted it to be blue, the other wanted it to be pink. Ouch! All right? It's okay. Let me do it. The princess pricked her finger with the needle of the spinning wheel and fell asleep. When she woke up after a hundred years... she wasn't one year older. You remind me of her. Shall we make love? CLINICAL EXPERIMENT GOES WRONG - PATIENTS COMMIT SUICIDE?! PSYCHIATRY DEPT. - DR AKU & SETSUKO TAKAHARA QUESTIONED PSYCHIATRY DEPT. - DR AKU & SETSUKO TAKAHARA QUESTIONED Perhaps they had trouble outside of work? Everyone at the university thought they were an ideal couple. At the time, Aku was the black sheep of the psychiatry world. When he got into trouble because of his experiments, he left to study in the U.S. I heard that they separated after that. Then Setsuko married Tomoo Suma, who was working in the same lab. Was Aku experimenting in the field of deprogramming? The psychiatry world at that time considered it as an unscientific field of study. He probably used a drug like LSD, along with voluntary medication, to control personality disorders, suicidal drives, possession and schizophrenic paranoia. Whether this was effective... it's difficult to say. He seems to have directed his research towards mind control. Deprogramming and brainwashing are basically the same. I heard that anyone, without exception, can be brainwashed within 72 hours. Yes. The 'Ultimate Truth Church' has filed a faw suit. They say their followers were abducted by force, then confined and subjected to deprogramming. Although it's not directly related to our case, I have been investigating that Psychorium and... discovered that deprogramming is a big part of their business. Families of patients have been paying quite a lot for that treatment, but there's nothing illegal about the whole thing. Nonetheless, we asked one of their employees to come in today for an informal interview. It's over but, since we knew you were coming in, we asked him to wait. We're here. Please... What is this? AOKIGAHARA Aokigahara is beautiful. Mountains are boring. You just climb up and down. No matter what mountain I climb, I always see Mt. Fuji in the distance. That depresses me. I dreamed that I was in a cave. That's great. You remembered me. But you weren't in my dream. I dreamed that I slept with you. I didn't even know you were back in Japan. You are like an island, detached from the continent of reality. "No man is an island". So you remember the John Donne poem. You're not an island either. I'm here on business. An expert on abnormal criminal personalities. - You knew? - It doesn't suit you. I want to know about one of your patients. Her hobby is photography. She reads Nietzsche and Grof. Her name's Yumiko Asahi. You should know her. What about Nietzsche? It must be your influence. A tool for your deprogramming? Analysing the personality of the Yamanote Line Murderer? Or do you want me to do it for you? Or is this... part of the questioning? Isn't it ironic? Our reunion after eight years is once again linked to a series of killings. There is no such thing as random killing: that was your hypothesis. The current serial killings... can't be indiscriminate... there must be some common factor. I see. You think the victims were chosen because they had certain emotions in common, a strong tendency... towards self-destruction... which lured the killer to them. It synchronized with that of the killer. Yes. It's as strong a feeling as your feeling of isolation. Very interesting. The killer chose Yumiko for his first victim and stabbed her in the back... that's why I need the details of your analysis on her. Or shall I get a warrant? Impossible - as you well know, my practice as a therapist is legal. I can't pass on information regarding my patients. I was hoping you'd do it as a personal favour... for old times' sake. You mean in bed? Very funny. How does the mind become a camel? How then does the camel become a lion? And finally, how does the lion become a child? This never seems to have gotten through to Yumiko. Yumiko wasn't the only one who became a victim of Aku's deprogramming, but recently we have taken stronger measures to fight against... diabolical temptations... by crooks like Aku. The punishment she received has strengthened our follower's faith. Aku diagnoses our followers as mentally ill and hospitalizes them. He then brainwashes them. It is ethically unpardonable. It would help us if you can tell us about the people who were especially close to Yumiko. We consider all our members to be one family. Love is distributed equally... never more, never less. Excuse me. Are you Dr. Setsuko Suma? Sorry for the interruption, but there's an urgent call from the police. Dr. Suma speaking. Hello... It's me... Aku. Excuse me... There's something I remembered after we parted that I think you should know. Twas so long since we last met, that I must have been nervous. I feel like you're isolating yourseff with a barrier. I doubt whether you'll be able fo get close to the killer's mind. You wipe off your perspiration. I'm sure a change is occurring inside of you. What do you mean? Part of the killer's mind is already inside of you. I felt that... You probably don't notice it yet. Be honest. Like the time when we were together. 1am now in Tsurumaki-cho, Waseda where the killing took place. Although it has not yet been officially announced, there seems to be... little doubt that the killer is the same person responsible for the Yamanote Line murders. The killer has finally moved away from the Yamanote Line. Why did the killer chose a less crowded residential area for the site of this crime? Not only will the police now have to expand their sphere of investigation, but there is also an increased level of danger to the public. Concerning these bizarre murders of young women, the police still refrain from providing detailed information to the press. To help put an end to these murders, it is essential that the press keep the public informed and up to date. I, too, cannot help but pray that the case will be solved as soon as possible. ACCEPTANCE OF THE REALITY OF ONEIROID- PERSONALITY IN SHAMANISM -BY REI AKU SCHIZOPHRENIA OF METAMORPHOSIS CONTROL - BY SETSUKO TAKAHARA Sorry. I knocked, but there was no answer. I was just thinking... Small sprouts appear from the ground... and seven roses bloom, one after another. Tomoo... Have I changed since I began... working on this case? The way I talk... or the way I behave? Why? I... well... never mind. It's a bizarre case... Slow down a bit. Rushing will only confuse you. When I think that someone... might be killed again next Monday... It's not your fault. Guilt will only drive you mad. MONDAY, 15:30 CLEAR/RAIN SHOWERS RAIN PROBABILITY: 80% Special Investigation Headquarters to all stations... three hours till assumed time of next murder. Maintain a state of emergency throughout the city. Inspectors must detain and question all suspicious persons. The perpetrator is armed with an object resembling a syringe... and is assumed mentally unstable. Body searches must only be undertaken with extreme caution. That's enough. Stop! Is there any special meaning in 6 pm, Monday? First division to Command Room. Investigation Headquarters. This is Banba, first division. Any information from other divisions yet? There is no information of any importance yet. Roger. First division, Banba, to Superintendent 1-0-2-3. Report. We are undertaking intensive questioning around Shinanomachi Station of any dubious persons. We have not yet been able to identify any possible suspect. Roger. You're smoking more... and wearing sunglasses to hide the bags under your eyes. They don't suit you. The killer is inside me. SHIBUYA SUGAMO HAMAMATSU-CHO TSURUMAKI-CHO, WASEDA KORAKUEN Inspector, do all veteran inspectors assimilate with the perpetrator they are after? What are you trying to say? Are you taking Suma's theory seriously? If we don't, then what do you then suggest? Just do your job! She's the one in danger. ANOTHER MURDER! FIFTH VICTIM! POLICE BAFFLED! KILLER STRIKES AGAIN AMIDST STATE OF EMERGENCY! FEAR SPREADS IN THE CITY! FIVE WOMEN KILLED! I'd say it's cruel... If you only see this, then maybe... By the way you look, I assume this isn't a social visit? Unreasonable compensation and coercive treatment... are these the results of your research? I don't choose patients... nor their family situations. I have no security. I stake my life at times. The risk is immense. You're infamous. Amongst destructive cults... and hypocrites, I presume? Because I'm successful with what I'm expected to do. My clients are all grateful. I used to respect you as a psychiatrist... even when my father and Professor Souda criticized your radical methods. I really did. So? You came because you're convinced that I'm the serial killer. Right? But I don't have a motive. Your motive is beyond common logic. That I present secret codes and mock the world when they're not solved? What about my alibi? You can easily fabricate that. Why be so defensive towards your former lover? You didn't love me... you only needed me. What you wanted was not me as a woman, but... as the daughter of Professor Takahara, Dean of the University. And me as a competent assistant. You only think in terms of yourself and jump to the wrong conclusions. You've returned to your bad habits. I was scared; I couldn't grasp your heart. The more I tried to explore... the more darkness there was... and such enormous hollowness. How can such a man... love anyone? You don't even understand what love is. Not even half of it... I know. I'm happy now! I have a loving husband and a home. I can't believe how happy I am! I wonder... It's true! He's given me everything that you couldn't. He still makes an effort. You just want everything. The way you are now, his destruction is inevitable. You're wi ro ng' You ran away from me... and from your research. No, you ran away. My feelings for you haven't changed. For you... I'm ready to blow myself up. Stop it! I won't let you control me. Dr. Aku... Don't you have... acute colour blindness? You must know the meaning of these photos? I see... strong sense of isolation, colour blindness, and forming a letter with the crime sites. This is the thread leading to the killer. You may not directly be the murderer... Perhaps you are controlling someone... and that someone... may be acting under your direction to... Through mind control by brainwashing? Are you saying it's related to my deprogramming? What do you think? I'm afraid you're the one who's becoming deranged. Who'd believe such wild fantasies? 25 hours after giving a dosage of LP Though still rejecting, she has been calmed. For the purpose of improving rapport, we've administered two ampoules of haloperidol... and 12 hours later... a further ampoule of haloperidol was injected. You can't speak on your own. You're saying your prayers with this attitude. What is the truth? To believe in our high priest. Who is your high priest? He is the ultimate god of the universe, reborn. What do you mean, "reborn"? Resurrected. Resurrected? How do you know your high priest is God? Because the church says so? Is that the ultimate truth? With your attitude, missionary work is impossible. Try and convert me. You can't do anything on your own. That's right. You can't do anything all alone. Try and convert me. You can't do it. You can't do anything alone. Who in the church said that? Leave me alone. Is there such a thing as the only, the ultimate truth? Our high priest is God. He is the only one who can save this world. With your attitude, missionary work is impossible. Try and convert me. - Come to our training centre. - You can't do it? You can't do it on your own! Shut up! Is that the attitude of a follower of God? Your attitude is unfit for missionary work! Your church is phoney! You've been brainwashed. Are you happy? Are you happy? Why do you do that? You don't understand yourself. Someday the messiah will appear and redeem me. There is no messiah. Please save me! What you're saying is true. I was wrong. I'm basically... I have... a likeable personality. But... my senses are so acute... that people resent me. You can take it easy now. You've been brainwashed. It might take a bit of time... but to rediscover the real you, we'll work together. You're safe now. When I'm with other people... I feel that I'm so different from them. You only listen to what I say... yet seem to understand my pain. I feel that your thoughts... are similar to my thoughts... But... the more I think about it... I don't understand which is which. Vi. It's safe now. Go to sleep. I told you: I'm not hungry. Don't worry. I'm fully aware of myself. Stop it - they irritate me. The smell... the colours... I tried to save her... the pit was so deep and so dark... I was so scared... scared to death. I remember... that I gripped my mother's hand tightly. But... A bee appeared. It hurts! It stung me. The bee stung me. It's so swollen. I tried to save mother, but... a bee stung me. Ooow! It hurts! So you let go of her hand? I'm telling the truth! I didn't deliberately let go of her hand. It's the truth. Why don't you believe me? How many times do I have to say this? Well... I think we'd better go. Could... could the killer be after Setsuko? Do you have something on your mind? Not really. I think Dr. Suma should have a little bit of rest. She seems fatigued. Have you heard of Dr. Rei Aku? Yes. They worked together in the lab. Do they still keep in touch? I heard she met him, in relation to the investigation. Do you know about what kind of matters exactly? No... we don't really talk much about work. Is anything the matter with Dr. Aku? Let me know when she's feeling better. She might be holding back some crucial information. The doctor will not remain seated in the audience... but will be on stage with the patient. Do you follow me? Open up your mind. Like dust floating in the air... you disintegrate completely... and helplessly float on... searching for your mate. Like making love... assimilate with him. HAVE THE KILLINGS STOPPED? NO MURDER LAST NIGHT SERIAL MURDERS LIKELY TO REMAIN UNSOLVED? "I have to go to the hospital... dinner is in the fridge. "Please don't forget to take the DZR I'll be home by 5:30. "It's best to rest for the time being." Nothing is finished yet. Act two will soon begin... you are no longer able fo step down from the stage. Stop it! Why don't you come? Why don't you come and cafch me? I'm waiting for you. You dreamed about me again, didn't you? You know all about me, don't you? Isn't that so? If it is, then please hang up this moment! Why don't you hang up? Why don't you? You can't do it. You want to hear my voice. That's not true! Come right now... to my place. You need me. Be honest! What do you take me for? I love you' That door won't open. Unfortunately, I couldn't wait here for you to arrive. I can't tell you the reason now. Please wait for me in this room until I return. I know you're here. What is this, anyway? Are you trying to brainwash me? I was hoping you'd come here. I'm not forcing anything on you. Naturally, you can refuse to watch the video, if you don't want to. Block your ears if you don't want to hear my voice. You are acting of your own free will... isn't that right? Now let me begin my lecture. You decide what you think, how you feel and act. You use time as you wish. You believe that loving and hating people... is your own free choice. What is this? Are you playing with my mind? You killed them, didn't you? I've had enough! I've had enough of this! I've had enough! Is this my punishment for leaving you? Please repeat that. Are all the killings my fault? You want to be free, don't you? Let me out of here! Won't you give me the details? Please let me out of here! What did you mean? Please free me. Please! Please repeat that. You've made me your captive. You want to be free, don't you? Please let me out of here... Won't you give me the details? I... I love you. I love you even now. Please repeat that. I love you even now. You want to be free, don't you? Don't know how to control myself. Please repeat that! You want to be free, don't you? Won't you give me the details? What do you mean? Please repeat that. You want to be free, don't you? Won't you give me the details? What do you mean? I'm all right now. You want to be free, don't you? Won't you give me the details? What do you mean? Won't you give me the details? I killed him. I'm sorry. I know you're troubled. You want it all. You'll destroy him. You're wrong! Disintegration. Are you saying that Ms. Suma was the real target? Doctor! What is it? MORE BIZARRE THAN THE MURDER ITSELF - POLICE INSPECTOR'S HUSBAND WAS A WOMAN! Until yesterday, the murder victim was believed to be a man. The victim, Tomoo Suma, was the husband of Dr. Setsuko Suma, an analyst for the Metropolitan Police. The police discovered that Mr. Suma was equipped with female sex organs. Another layer of mystery is added fo the serial killings. The killer has managed to be consistent in killing people in the most unexpected of manners. Since the serial killings were wrongly thought to have ended, fear has now increased even more. If the killer knew about Mr. Suma and chose him as the target, police believe... the killer is even more twisted than was previously thought... and the mystery deepens. A month after the first murder, with the sixth victim being the inspector's husband, and with him in fact being a woman... Can you understand such a relationship? I certainly can, especially concerning them. Tomoo was basically androgynous. Androgynous? Yes, he was an androgyne, meaning he had the sexual organs of both sexes. As Selsuko's career became more established, Tomoo's male sex organs possibly became unnecessary. They were both excellent researchers, so... I'm sure it was a logical agreement on both parts. Only, I had no idea that Tomoo was emasculated... until now. Professor, I heard you disliked Aku. I detested him. In his opinion, insanity and death are stages on the way to higher levels of consciousness. His mysticism-orientated ideas seemed the result of desperation. The wrong attitude for a medical career. He's determined that everything in this world is mad. - What about her memory? - I don't know, only... she says Aku and herself are responsible for the killings; that their relationship lures the victims to them; and that all the victims are their alter-egos. That all sounds typical of a schizophrenic. For two years, one of my patients has continuously told me, "You're the one who's insane." Because he was so persistent, I was starting to show some of the symptoms. Naturally, I'm all cured now! My brain was melting and dripping out of my ears. Bodily sensory hallucination... the patient's insanity transferred. When you're low on morale and let your guard down, it can be dangerous in our line of business... just like with your job. Being trapped in the patient's paranoia... could at times result in death. I'm sorry about your husband. I'm sorry. Forgive me. We still haven't found Aku. He's been missing since your husband was found murdered. We got a warrant and searched the Psychorium. We're investigating his other patients. From now on... I'll personally guard you. I promise I'll catch Aku. Shall we go back in? - Tama 1, respond. - Tama 1 responding. During transportation from Jikei Medical University Hospital, Dr. Setsuko Suma disappeared. - Don't you know where she was? - She did return from the garden. - In the hospital robe? - Yes, of course. She was sedated. She couldn't have got far from the hospital. Calling emergency search team... - Characteristics? - 159cm tall... The murderer has killed six people for no reason. Now he's after her. Ms. Suma's in danger, unless we find her quickly. Aren't you afraid? I only have one question... Why are you doing this? Is this what you mean by love? Is it all my fault? I'm no longer... afraid of anything. There is not always only one answer... yet people always seek the one answer. I wonder why? I finally found you, Yuki. Doctor... you're a devil. The deprogramming was a fake. You turned me into a killer. You've awakened me, manipulated and laughed at me! You enjoy killing. You're a pleasure-seeking homicidal maniac. That's your hidden personality. V! Vi. It hurts. Father! Father? Why are you silent? A bee stung me. I tried to save mother. It's true. Don't you believe me... father? Why won't you believe me? If you don't believe me... then kill me. Please kill me. Kill me. Kill me. Kill me! It's all my fault. Kill me. Kill me now. Come on - kill me. Now. You said... Her death wish doesn't result from the frauma of the bee and matricide. That trauma is fictional, imprinted by me. Twas supposed to control the death wish deep inside of her mind. Location is 7-14-3, Hagoromo-Cho. Do you have confirmation of the identity of the person reporting in? Affirmative. The person reporting in is Rei Aku, age 45. From the circumstantial evidence, probability of a suicide is very high. We conclude that Yuki Takei, whose body was found at the scene, is the major suspect for the serial killings. We've already arranged to send the body for autopsy... and have informed the department in charge. She had this with her. She loved you.
