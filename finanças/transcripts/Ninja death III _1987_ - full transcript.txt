(dramatic music) - I'll tell you about your parents. - Who was my mother? - Your mother comes from a great family in Japan. Her name is Mariko. Tiger, don't forget. If you see the ninja with the mask, don't confront him! - Master. (grunts) Why not? - Because he is your father, Wai Chin Yi. (gasps) (grunting) (somber music) (suspenseful music) - Sakura! (upbeat music) Sakura. (grunts) (grunts) - Brother, where are you going? - To get Tiger a teacher. - So tell me, what am I? Why do you treat me so well? Tell me! - It's not the right time to tell you. - What do you mean it's not the right time? At least you can tell me what part you and Brother play in this matter. I always find out the truth so late. Come on, tell me! - I'm your servant. - [Tiger] What's the matter? - I hope you can teach Tiger the original ninja kung fu. - This Chinese kid must be White Tiger. - Man. - Huh, what White Tiger? I'm Tiger White. - That's right, he hasn't got the plum sign, so it can't be him. - Let me go. Please let me go. I'm innocent. (suspenseful music) (grunting) - I will finish planning to avenge him. (explodes) (grunting) (growling) - Best ninja. But why? Best ninja. Best ninja. Best ninja, best ninja, best ninja, best ninja. - Sorry, master, I failed. - It's not your fault. At least I know he's still alive. - I wish to die. - You fool! It's not even your fault. Even if it is your fault, I'll not let you kill yourself. Right now, I need people to help. Tiger is not ready yet. Revenge is still a hope. Who else can help me, if you die? From now on, you shouldn't think about that. Shaw, Demo. - Yes? - From now on, try to help. - Sakura. I'm sorry for all these troubles I've caused. - Please don't say that, I'm just fine. (serene music) - I don't know when I will finish the practicing of the royal style. All I want to do now is to get revenge! - No. You can't beat him yet. - Didn't you say that my mother's here? Do you think she can help? I'm sure she can. - She is here to see how your practices go. - Why doesn't she show herself? - She will come, sooner or later. - No other reasons? - Yes. Because her brother sent many killers after her and yourself. - I don't know what you mean. - Your mother is the sister of the Japanese Emperor, and due to the game of power, many people try to kill her and yourself, because you are partly Chinese, you are. Well, I don't know about the rest. - Hey, Sakura, where are you going? - Just to check the cooking. - Sakura, don't avoid me. Stay around here. - Hmm? Tiger, tell me the truth. You like Sakura? - I... No. - Right. (laughs) Forget it, just forget it. Come on. - Go? Go where? - Where else? To practice. - Practice? But when am I gonna get the chance to get my revenge? - It's about time. Tonight I'll show you a place to practice. - Okay, let's go. (suspenseful music) (growling) (laughing) - Master, see the way you walk, almost faster than me. - This is all because I go through this road almost for 10 years, that's why I know my way better than you do. - Master, how you gonna train me? I just can't wait. - Hmm. Very simple, you just go into that temple. And you'll win. (suspenseful music) - Is this a trap? - Lots of people go in every day, it can't be a trap. - Oh, so it's easy. You just watch me go in. Oh no, use your ears. This is so easy I can't believe it. Master! (grunts) Master. So who are you? - Thank you for the three of you. - Master, what's going on? - They are three of the four masters in this temple. Master Death, Kethosis, and Limper. (chuckling) - What about the other one? - That's me, I'm the fourth one. - Brother, don't be chicken. Come and have a go. - Hey kid, come over here, chicken? (chuckling) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) (grunting) (chuckling) - With that kung fu, if you fight with the Grand Master, he will kill you right away. - Son of a bitch. You guys are not gonna beat me. (grunting) - Hey boy. Have a good taste of it? - Master! (suspenseful music) - You think it'll work? - Three days later, we'll see. Come on, let's go. (suspenseful music) - That was sky hammering. - Yeah. - Right, buddy. You can come out now. - Huh? (suspenseful music) - I cover, you go first. (grunts) - Fujiko-san. Where are you going? - I'm going to see my sister, right now. - She's fine. I've sent someone to her place and asked her to come over. - Princess, where are you going? I'd like to guide you. - I have my own plan, nobody should follow. I want you to stay here and wait for Sakura. Mid-August is coming. I'm afraid we won't have enough power, and you and Sakura will need to help me. - Sakura and myself will try our best to cut down the strength of the Yi Ho Ling. - Hmm. - Hmm. - Hey, do you know, not too many people from this world can easily get away from a fight like that? - Then why don't you three of you use kung fu to take care of that ninja? - Oh Tiger, you just don't know his type of kung fu. (suspenseful music) Eh? - I'll go and check. - Hey, just wait. Before you go, remember, be careful. - I do know I will go to hell with all of you today. (grunting) - So you guys want to have some fun with me. (grunting) - Thank you very much, sir. Demo will not forget, you saved my life. - Oh, just forget it. I don't want you to give me this. I'm gonna see the princess now. - You know I'm the princess's servant? (chuckles) - So the princess's servants are powerful, very brave too. Now I know that it's all true. Now lead the way. (suspenseful music) - Wait, Tiger. - Oh, so you're a female. What do you want from me? - So you, you are White Tiger. - And you are? - Cut the crap. (suspenseful music) (grunting) Shameful. What else can you do? I won't harm you. Come and get me. - All right. I'll play with you slowly. - Right, please let me try your royal kung fu style technique. - How does she know about that? (grunts) Running fast in a strong wind. Little rain to cure the heart. All sadness gone with the wind. Slowly get to power our arm. - Try to get the power back in it. Turn over and hit the head. 1000 mountain wind, just go. Turn back, no way to hit the road. - How come you know my style? - Hey, you can learn it, so do I. Practice is better than theory. - Who did not start out from the basic theory? - Tiger, think about what I will do. - Who the hell knows it? (grunting) - Hey, I know all about those eight styles, you be careful. - Take it. - Why? - No way. - Try this one. - I don't care. - Coming up. I'm gonna beat you. - Very good. We'll see. Hey you boy. Just now, not even one hit can really worry me. What do you think you're really good at? - Forget it. This is a secret. The blind boxing. - Boxing originally is a secret. The royal style is known by many royal people. If you match with a good expert, it will be come useless, and what's the big deal? (suspenseful music) - From what Demo has told me, the Grand Master already became a super kung fu expert. - What if he's really good? - That's right. In the ninja tradition, double sky hammer is the highest kung fu that a ninja can reach. Well, we'll have to see how it goes, won't we? All right, let's go and have a look, then. - I know about that. But is there any way up? - From what I know, I'm afraid even the royal style couldn't match it. - Does that mean we're totally hopeless? The young master cannot beat him? Not at all? - It's too bad. I don't think Shaw's died for nothing. At least he gave the medicine to Master Wai Chin Yi, didn't he? Maybe three days later, Master Wai will become normal, and the rest, we'll just bet on our luck. - Well then, how about the action? - I already have a careful plan. We just wait for the master. But I need help from everybody here. (somber music) - Shit. What's wrong with me? Why do I make myself feel so bad because of a woman? I only lost a fight to that woman. What's the big deal? (serene music) - Master. - Where have you been? - Master, it seems you're not feeling well. I heard you talking about a woman. Is she making you feel bad? - Ha, what kind of a person do you think I am? How can I feel bad just for a woman? But then, I do feel a little bit shameful. That woman, well she looks down on me. It's hard. - Master, do you know that lady well? How can she have that kind of power to make you look like a fool? - I really don't know her. She wears a hat and has a piece of cloth to cover up her face, all of it. I think, well I've never met her. Hey, do you know who she is? - [Sakura] She must be the princess. - I don't know why she did it. I don't know why she did it. She said that she wants to try. She wanted to try my royal style, to see how good I am. You know I'm just a beginner, so of course. I'll start. - What did she say? - She said I'm a fool. If I fight with somebody that already knows about the royal style, if I just start, I'll be beaten by him. I won't have a chance to win. - What she says is correct. - I was so mad. When I think about it, I start fighting with her in my own creation, and we just make an even fight. So it's easy. - Own creation? What's that? - Oh, it's all bullshit. But she later told me, if I meet someone that can use a double sky hammer, I will be killed. She asked me to go again. I think that she will bring somebody who knows how to use a hammer. When I think about this, I start feeling bad. - Oh? - But I think of it in this way. Good men won't fight with girls, like a chicken wouldn't fight with a dog. Then I feel good again. - Master, the way you're thinking's wrong. You're really too chicken. You must practice well. It doesn't matter who you match, you have to win. Because only winning can save your life, losing can lead to death. - Sakura! What did you say? (birds chirping) - Sakura. What you said is very true. Loss can lead to death. - Master, I think Princess must be feeling very bad too, worrying if the plan isn't successful, all that effort will be wasted. That's why she comes over here to see how the master is doing. - Hmm, that's right. Seems to me, being the teacher of the young master, I should feel shameful. I didn't teach the young master well. - Master, is the double sky hammer that powerful? - Huh. The royal style almost cannot compete with it. - Then what should we do? What if the young master meets the Grand Master one day? Isn't it like an egg hitting a rock, one to one, one to go, two to come, goes in pairs, isn't that right? - Mhmm. - Master, then what should we do now? We can't just open our eyes to see the young master go and let himself killed. Master. You told me, although that you're blind, you're clever. Master, I know you must have a solution. I beg you. Please save the Tiger. - I'll have to go ask the princess. - Looking for me? - Princess, I'm no good. I want to die! - Blind Master. This is not your fault. This is not your fault. - Princess! - You already did your best. I'm thankful. With your help in such a short time, you have to teach Tiger well, he has improved. This is not an easy thing to do. - Thanks for your encouragement. - Too bad my power is so limited and we have to face the Grand Master. His kung fu is too good. Only use the royal style, is not enough to confront him. - Princess, I really can't do anything. - This is from Sha-Lin, Book of Kung Fu, written by the master. It is very powerful style. If we practice it well, and also if we practice the royal style well, we may be able to try and combine them together. This will be the only chance to overcome them. - Yes. (serene music) Tiger. We're very lucky to have gotten this Book of Kung Fu. I myself never tried it, so I can't really help you a lot. Luckily, your foundation is good. Just follow the pictures of this book to practice it. Shouldn't have any kind of problem. You have such a big load. Practice is important. - Guess there's no choice for me. I'll just try my best. - Hold it! (suspenseful music) - Tiger. Tiger! Hey Tiger, what are you practicing? How come I don't understand it? - It's nothing, I just practice for fun. Hey, last night, you were good. (light music) (chuckles) - You got a really good lover. Tiger, Sakura and I will start action. You just wait here and practice. - Master, what kind of action? - Well, concerning this matter-- - Master, take a rest, I'll tell him. - Oh. Hmm. - Don't you think it's too dangerous? - We're forced to do it. Our position isn't good. This is the only way. - We have to do it? - That's right. - Sakura, I owe you too much. - Don't say that. Maybe we're only a tool for someone. We don't have choices in our life. Besides, we're more than just friends now. (sighs) - What's the matter? I didn't complain. And you? - Oh my god, I'm not complaining to you about that, I'm done... - Yes, yes yes? - I'm afraid that we'll have to part. Sakura! Sakura! Sakura! (grunts) I've got an appointment now. (somber music) So, you've got a helper. I'm not afraid. - Very good. You talk just like a boy. Come on. Hmm. (grunts) (grunts) You can stop now. I must try to make you understand. Within two days, maybe you will meet with someone with a hammer. Compared with this, he's much better than you. Go. (suspenseful music) - Hmm. Not again. They're always covering something. I just want to find out who are you and what you are. - Is everybody ready now, then? You two guys will lead the way. - Huh? Who is it? - It's me. Are you surprised? - Huh? Tiger! - So, all you guys are here. Very well. Master, who's this woman? - Tiger, stop it right now. - Master, she-- - She is your mother. (gasps) - Mother? Fujiko. - Yes. - Sakura. Master, is she really my mother? (grunts) - Tiger, although I'm blind, my heart is clever. She is your real mother. Also the mother of the Emperor. You really are my mom? Mother. I finally found my mother! I've waited 18 years. I, White Tiger, have finally seen my mother. - Tiger. Come here. Let me see you. - No. - Tiger. - Why should I let you see me? - Tiger. - Tiger! (somber music) - I didn't see you all this year. Come close to your mother. Can't you even do it? - No! I don't want you. - But why? - Because, I haven't made up my mind if I'm going to take you as my mother or not. - Tiger. - Tiger! Go see your ma. Don't do this to her. - Why? Why can't I do it? Master. She is my mom. I know it. But, for 18 years, how did I get through all those days? Do you know it? Since the day I was born to this world, my heart was broken from day one, because I didn't have a dad, or a mother. Other children, if they were hungry, they had a good mother. They could make a good meal for them. They were always having a full stomach. What about me? I had to eat just like a beggar, asking for food. When it's cold, people have their mothers to make dresses for them, what about me? A whole year passed, I only got one suit. How about that? Mother. That's a word that's not known to me. I feel so sorry for my mother. I'm afraid to hear this word. When other children called their mother, I'd just turn away and pretend I didn't hear it! So listen to me. For 18 years you let me go. 18 years without a mother! No kisses, no caring. - Tiger. - I'll say it again. 18 years you let me go through, 18 years without a mother, no kisses, no care, no love, no days! Always without a mother. You never cared for me. You never came to see me, and give me any news. You didn't care whether I was dead. I guess you don't understand! 18 years, I lived by myself. Sometimes eating, sometimes not. But I've survived, and I've become a strong man. And you really think that I should call you mother?! All these bad feelings I have, and all this sadness! How can I call you mother? Tell me, how can I?! - Tiger. I know that you're suffering. Sadness, difficulty, I had to go through too. My heart is not made of stone. I cannot stand for you to be separate from me. - But why? Tell me how come all these years, you never came to see me! Maybe I'm disgusting and you don't love me! Is that right?! (crying) - Tiger! Please, forgive your mother. I was forced to do this! Tiger, please don't hate your mother. - Mother! (chuckles) Mother. I had a feeling that you were my mom. It doesn't matter. Tell me. What have we got to do now? Tell me how I can kill that bloody Grand Master! - No, his kung fu is very good. Right now we can do it by chance. Go, Sakura. - Sakura, what are you doing? - Go on. - This is also part of the plan. - Mhmm. (suspenseful music) (fire crackling) (laughing) - Good! Well done. Sakura, how about the White Tiger? - It is not easy to track him. He has fallen into my brother's hand, but we don't have enough people. I hope that-- - Okay. If you need me, I will appear. - Thank you, Master. (suspenseful music) (grunting) - I blinded you 18 years ago. Didn't you realize? You dare to confront me, the Grand Master, even though you cannot see a thing? How can you be such a fool! If I don't kill three of you and Mariko, how can I stand in China? (spits) (chuckles) Very well. You fool. You will see how cruel I am! (laughing) (suspenseful music) (shouts) (shouting) - Sakura, how are things going on so far? - It's half done now. - That's great. The rest of it will depend on Blind Master. - If you tell me the news about White Tiger, I will spare your life. What a fool. You blind old man. (chuckles) - That's right. I'm old and blind. White Tiger is just a beginner. And as far as that can go, I just don't believe that the Grand Master of Yi Ho Ling will be afraid of him. - What you say seems right. But don't think that I am a fool. I know that Mariko is also a ninja. Yi Ho Ling's ninja. - Hmm. Yi Ho Ling has disappeared for 200 years. Don't you know? Everybody knows. - Yi Ho Ling is still there. Although Yi Ho Ling is not a mainstream ninja. His kung fu is very deep and also powerful, don't you know? - Hmm? Stop wasting your time. Anyway, I've fallen into your hands at this time. Go ahead and kill me. I couldn't give a damn, personally. - Kill you? (laughing) Too bad you are already blind. You can't see the way I treat my enemies. I wonder, did you hear anything about bloody flower? - Huh? Bloody flower? That really hurts! - I need human skin. More than one year already. By using the bloody flower, I can let you die the worst way, the worst way possible. (laughing) - Stop playing games with me. If you're good, try to come with me. If I lose the game, well, I wouldn't care about the bloody flower. You can do what you want, and I won't say a thing. - You won't? - Ha. Well let's go to a place. I dare you to go. - Ha, I'll go for it. I'm the Grand Master, I'm not afraid to go anywhere. If I was, I would not be in China. - Good, then. - I know now. Mother. But if we do this, it's gonna be dangerous. - The Grand Master has too many people around him. Only in this way can we cut down his power. - What a plan. Grand Master is now falling into our calculations, and I think we've got a good chance. A good plan. - Sometimes kung fu is the same too, especially with the expats. - Sakura's back! Sakura's back! Sakura. - Smoothly, it's done. The Grand Master is now weaker than before. He can't get away. (suspenseful music) - Blind man, you bring me to this place. What do you want? (gasps) (chuckles) - We have a way of fighting that nobody's beaten yet. You didn't carry your hammer, Grand Master. It's your own fault. Get into formation, boys. (dramatic music) Go! - I heard about you. China has such a good style. But you guys know who it is that you're dealing with? Let me teach you. (suspenseful music) (explodes) (arrows whooshing) (grunting) - Mother. - [Mariko] Tiger. - [Sakura] Master. - It's so late, why don't you go to bed? - Tomorrow morning you will have a fight with the Grand Master, and tonight I bring Sakura to sleep with you. - How can this happen? Tomorrow's gonna be a big day. I can't waste my energy on something like that. It's stupid! - Sakura, you go in. - Hmm. - Mother. - A true master should keep his energy during practicing, both the spirit and energy are important, and so he should keep all kinds of rules in order to practice. But now you are ready. Before the fight, you need a female. - What does this mean? I don't know. I've never heard of it. - It is not something I made up. Tiger, have you heard about the Warlord kung fu style yet? - What does it mean? - Well, the Warlord is a famous master. He had the reach of the highest point of kung fu. He discovered that before the fight, he needed to relax his mind, so he can concentrate well. Make love before the fight, that's how he killed Kimotoba, famous kung fu fighter. - But did Kimotoba really... - Kimatoba, he believed in no sex, against the human will. At last he was not concentrating, and was killed by the Warlord. If I am not careful, then you could be killed as well, my son. - But Mother. - Tiger. You just go in. Go in. It's not early. You need some rest afterwards. - Sakura. Do you believe in my mother? - Yes I do. I love you. If it is for you, I'm willing to do anything. (serene music) - Sakura. - For your victory. - Sakura. - Sakura. - Master. After tomorrow, if you get your victory, then you have to go back to Japan, and you will become noble and rich. I'm afraid by that time you'll forget me. - I won't. Sakura. You're my first woman since I grew up. I won't forget you. I swear to god. Please believe me. I swear right now. - Hey, swearing is just like a show. By the time tomorrow comes, it will disappear. - Sakura, you're talking to me now. Not somebody else. You can believe me. - I know what you think, and I understand. But people change with their environment. Sometimes they forget their promises. - So what do you want me to do so you will believe in me? - Master, I'm not asking for anything. I just want god to bless you on the big fight tomorrow, and that you go peacefully and come back proudly. - Sakura. - Master, hold me tight. Master. - Wait for me. Just wait. I will return to you. I will come back tomorrow. - I'll wait for you. - What now? - Yours and Fujiko's action has totally failed! - Fujiko and I have brought shame to the organization. We'll kill ourselves later. But before we die, can we worship a little bit? - All right, you go ahead. (banging) - Stop! - Because we tried to get White Tiger, Yi Ho Ling ninja all came out, we didn't make it, many people got killed. For their spirits, I wish the master to give them a prayer. - Hmm. (suspenseful music) (explodes) Go! (grunting) - Demo! - Demo! - Demo! (suspenseful music) - Brother. - He's not the real one. (gasps) Let's go. - Yeah. (suspenseful music) (explodes) (shouts) (grunting) - Huh? (shouts) (grunting) (dramatic music) (shouts) (suspenseful music) (grunting) - Brother! Brother! Brother! Brother. Brother! Brother. Brother. - Take care... Take care of the master. - Yes Brother. Brother! Brother! Oh, Brother! Oh, Brother! (crying) Brother! (suspenseful music) (shouts) (shouts) (grunting) (shouts) (gasps) (gasps) (shouts) (gasping) - Sakura! (suspenseful music) (shouts) (suspenseful music) (shouts) (grunting) (shouts) (explodes) (gasps) - Chin Yi! (suspenseful music) (shouts) (grunts) (groaning) (crying) Chin Yi! Chin Yi! Have you forgotten? I'm Mariko! (crying) - Mariko? At last we're back together again. - Master. - Well. (crying) - [Tiger] Dad! - The blood revenge of plum. At last, it has been done. (somber music) (serene music) (somber music) (crying) - Goodbye. (serene music) (explodes) (suspenseful music)
