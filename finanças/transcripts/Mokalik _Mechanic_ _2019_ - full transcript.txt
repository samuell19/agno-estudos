You kept to your word [chuckles] -[Ogidan] How are you sir? -[in English] God bless you. We thank God. [man] Kamoru! Kamoru! Kamoru! You are senseless! How dare you disrespect me like that? Or you think we are mates right? That's your business. My boss instructs that you return his spanner unfailingly today. See your head like that of a gorilla. I have returned your spanner since yesterday. You are talking like a stupid person. I'm talking about the size 12 spanner. It seems someone has loosened your brain with a jack. I said i have returned your size 12 spanner. You have not returned it. It was the size 14 spanner you returned. My boss is asking for the size 12 spanner you borrowed. Look at your mouth like a menstruating dog. See, I returned all your spanners yesterday. Don't complicate my day with your issues. See, return it today unfailingly. I'm warning you. Look at your disgusting legs like a wheelbarrow in a pothole. You don't return it. We would see whose legs look like a wheelbarrow between us. Fool. [laughs] That is good one. We thank God. I'm happy. Ponmile! Get down. Hello, young man! He does not understand Yoruba? Are you not the one he is talking to? Can't you greet? Good morning sir. Now, that's how a responsible child behaves. I thought you didn't understand Yoruba But you actually do. A responsible child responds to an elder's greetings with respect. Now, prostrate and greet me properly. Now, that's how a responsible child behaves. Thank you. So, he will stay with you. Now, go and get your bag. You see, We need to teach our children values. [Ogidan] This particular one refuses home training. I teach him all the time. Where's the money I gave to you? I thought as much. Your mom also packed some food for you. She doesn't want him to eat here. Mr. Ogidan, even if he didn't bring food here he'll get good food here. He'll get used to it. [chuckles] There's no problem. -Thank you, Chairman. I will be on my way. - Thank you. You're here now. Stay with the Chairman [chairman] Come here. Thank you. Ogidan. Alright sir, Thank you. Ponle! Always respond whenever I call. As big as this environment is, I am the chairman. And everything I say becomes final! Hey, Kamoru! Kamoru! Come. -My chairman. -[chairman] It will be well with you. Kamoru, kamoru. Where is your boss? He will be here soon. Look, this is Ponle. He's starting an apprenticeship today. Now, you'll take him to your boss. And tell Ajentina to pay me a visit when he arrives. Ponle! You'll follow Kamoru. I will come and check you there. He will be at your workshop for a while. Brother Taofeek. -[Taofeek] Kamoru. -This boy wants to change. Kamoru, you are senseless! You've now turned my shop to a changing room Go ahead. I don't know what you're hiding that has not been seen before. Where did you get this boy from? He is an apprentice. It is a lie. Just don't bring him here. Why not? I can't call a cow my master just because i want to eat meat. I sent your crazy friend "No Trouble" to get me beans From mama Fatai's canteen since morning. He's not back yet. Brother Taofeek, don't eat too much this afternoon, or have you forgotten today is Goke's freedom party? Thank you. I will skip lunch. I will take little beans in the morning. Brother Taofeek! You won't eat amala? You are insane! I won't eat more than a wrap. Mama Simi's amala is so irresistible. - See who wants to be a mechanic apprentice. -Where did you get him from again? Oh, my goodness. -Wonders shall never cease -Let's go. Brother Taofeek, see you later. If you see your friend No Trouble, Tell him that i'm going to kill him if he comes late with my food. Max Air. You see that aircraft? I know every aircraft and the time they fly by. Arik is next in about 15 minutes, Followed by Dana Air in about 30 minutes. By evening, International airlines pass. Like Air France. But before Air France, KLM will pass. Latest by 6:00pm, Air France will pass. Why are they so close? Oh, so you can talk. That is because they will soon land. The airport is nearby. You see, this is a very big place. Almost everything exists here. You see that side? That is where the vulcanizers are. Do you understand? That other side is where you will find the re-wires and upholsterers. Do you understand? That other area is where you will find the brake and clutch masters. Where we left the other time is where the painters are. Do you understand? Mama Simi and mama Fatai's canteens are over there. Now, when i talk of trained, experienced and competent mechanics, The aspiration of other Mechanics, That is where i do my apprenticeship, under my boss, Ajentina. Argentina. You can also feel the weight of the name. Did he support Argentina during the World Cup? My boss is not even a football fan. Ajentina, is a simple long form of "Aje". Aje... As in "Witchcraft"? My boss is a mechanic witch. That's why we call him Ajentina! Look, it is rather too early. I need to go and eat beans at Mama Fatai's canteen. I have eaten. No problem. You are free to watch me as i eat. [man] Mama Fatai, add to the beans. I hope your bread is soft? [man 2] I hope you will be able to finish what you have in front of you. Obama! What is your point exactly? Everyone knows that France won the World Cup. Everybody keep quiet! Keep quiet, please. What nonsense are you saying? How would you say France won the World Cup? How many white players did you see on the pitch playing for them? Not more than three. Now, listen to me carefully. What I am trying to say... The French were represented by blacks at the World Cup. Now tell me. -who won the world cup? -France. You are suffering from ignorance. No Trouble, Brother Taofeek has been looking for you. Brother Taofeek? Wandering fellow, the food he bought since morning is already cold. Hold on. Everyone hold on. Obama has a point. If we take a look at the players that represented France at the world cup, They were mostly blacks. So, if we take a look at it, Africa won the World Cup. Look at what this Ibadan boy is saying. -Are you making any sense. -He's saying the truth. What rubbish truth! All French players were blacks. And they were not Africans, they were French. French! How is that possible? Let me fill you in. Mbappe is from Cameroon. Pogba is from Guinea. Dembele is from Senegal. Kimpembe is from Congo. Kante is from Mali. Tolisso is from Togo. I can keep counting on and on. Obama, please wait. Let me tell you something. All these players just have African backgrounds. They were born and bred in France. Hence, they are French. Adelabu! Adelabu! Adelabu! You are not smart. You are speaking jargons from both sides of the mouth like you have double exhaust. One minute, you are with me. Next minute, you are with him. What's wrong with you? Brother Obama, you're right. Thank you! Chop knuckle. Why do they call him Obama? He smuggled himself into America during Obama's tenure as president, but got deported during trump's tenure. Those players are Africans Regardless of where they were born or raised. The French players were black. Africa won the World Cup. That's it. The World Cup is over. Let's talk about who will win the premiership this season. You like arguing over unnecessary things. Very simple. Chelsea will win it -Up Chelsea. -Chelsea! What is wrong with this village man? Now tell me. How many players did Chelsea sign during the transfer window to win the premiership? - What of the players they have on ground? - Forget that! Don't be deceived! - Man City will win the cup - Man City can't win. Calm down! You are all suffering from ignorance! You are all discussing foreign leagues while you ignore the Nigerian football league! Be patriotic! Love your country! You are here debating foreign leagues. Obama, this is coming from you? You who bailed out of Nigeria to go wash plates abroad. You are now saying all these You must be stupid [chattering, laughter] He was out of the country for just a day, yet he won't stop acting like a foreigner. [Obama] You are all illiterates. You can never be granted visa You frightened me. What are you looking for here? What are you doing here? Did you miss your way? You missed your way, from where to where? I think I know you from somewhere. [giggles] You too? I was with Kamoru. Kamoru! You better not let him hear you call him by his name. Kamoru doesn't joke with his seniority. [woman] Simisola! Lord, save me from my mother. I'm almost 12. And i'm almost in trouble with my mother. Simisola! I'm coming, mother! Oh yes, you are coming indeed. You know what, when you get there, You will find Kamoru inside a bowl of beans. And try not to get lost. I'm coming, Mother. Arik. Well done. My mother said i should not sell on credit today. Bring it, can you drink it all? Mix it the way I like it. Don't touch me. Don't start with that today. Mix it well, My back aches. Please, hurry up, serve him his own. Shake it very well. I want to frighten my wife today. To the right. It's okay. To the left. Take it back. Stop! You are Ponmile. Chairman told me about you. The most important thing is... this mechanic apprenticeship you came here for... you need to pay attention to it very well. If there is anything you don't understand, come and ask me. I will explain to you. Is that clear? These are your superiors. Tiri. -Yeah. This is Ponmile. Ponmile, these are your superiors. Is that clear? Do not underrate them. They are going to be training you. Do you understand? Respect them so you can learn quickly. -Kamoru! -Boss. Check that Mazda. Remove the reservoir tank. Take it to Emeka at Lapido. Tell him that is the type of reservoir tank i want Okay, Boss. - Tiri. -Yes, Sir You and Ponle quickly remove this Mercedes wheels. And when you are done, drain the engine oil. I'll be going to where he sent me. Ponmile. Ponmile! -Answer me! Say yes. -Yes. Yes! Good! You are welcome. Ah! Hey! This is a Mercedes-Benz. You see this car? Among all the cars in the world This car is the most powerful. Extremely strong! Let me tell you something new. Of all brands of cars in the world, there is no car as fast as Benz. The car is a speed demon. Ponmile! Get a big stone over there and place them at the rear wheels of the car. Place them at the other side too, then come back. I'll loosen the bolts, then we'll jack the car together. Who tightened the bolt? I'm in trouble. I loosened it. Ponmile! Have you ever changed a car wheel? No, but I've seen vulcanizers do it. Okay, you are definitely going to learn that here. That is part of the things you'll learn here. As soon as I've finished removing the bolts we will both jack up the car. Mercedes-Benz is not the fastest car. Pardon? What did you just say? Benz. There are many faster cars than Benz. You are senseless. You have no brain, not even a tiny piece. I think you are suffering from ignorance. Do not say what you don't know. Have you heard anywhere that there is a faster car than Benz? You are suffering from ignorance, and this is where i'll teach you. Bugatti. What is "Butaggi"? The fastest car. The fastest car. Do you know cars more than I do? Do you know how long i've been a mechanic? There's no car I haven't tested. I've driven so many cars to know Benz is the fastest of all. You that can't even change a car wheel. Claiming Butaggi is faster than Benz. Let me unscrew the bolts so we can jack this car. An i clear? Mm-hmm, it is done. This is not the right way to fix this. What is it? You are not supposed to completely loosen the bolts before jacking the car. So I'm not supposed to completely remove the bolts from the wheels Until I have jacked the car. Are you sure? I was just testing you. [laughs] Thank God you are smart. I thought you wouldn't know it. I was trying to test you. God saved you. Good. Ponmile! Ponmile! Come here, Mr. Butaggi. Now that you know how to do it, put the bolts and screw them. Do you understand ? I'll go and loosen the other side. You're a smart boy. Screw it well. Can you see this? It's called a bushing. It joins the arm from the wheels to the axle. It stands as the kneecap for humans. It is the kneecap of a car. The body parts of a car are also similar to that of a human being. As you can see, this bushing is bad. We need to change it. Tiri. Have it. Boss, what would happen if a car is being driven with a bad bushing? Drive a car with a bad bushing. Good question. If I remove your kneecap, would you still be able to walk? -No, sir. -Exactly! That is also how the car works. The body parts of a car are also similar to that of humans. Tiri, come. Go to my shed and bring me the box of fairly used bushings they supplied us yesterday. [Ajentina] Take a look at this. This engine uses oil. This is where you pour the oil into. Ponmile! Pay attention. Look at this. This is the car's engine. It uses oil. Without the oil, the car won't work. It works just like your stomach. Humans can't survive on empty stomachs. That is exactly how a car functions. A car would not work without petrol. This is the radiator. It is water that you will pour in it. It acts as the throat. Just like your throat, that is how the radiator is. This is the oil gauge. It is used to determine the oil level in a car Look at this. It is called a filter. Filter. The filter can be called the kidney in humans. The kidney then absorbs all the dirt in the human system which won't allow the dirt to harm the body. Now can you see that the parts of a car match that of the human body? That is exactly how it is. Our cars will be in good shape if we frequently take them for a checkup. We humans also need to visit the doctor regularly for checkups. It marks the beginning of your apprenticeship. Make sure you clean all the dirt hiding in the crevices of the bolt. I've heard. Otherwise it won't screw tightly back onto.... -I said I've heard! Mind your language. Don't you know I am your superior in this work? Do you know how long I've spent in this job? Six years! Six years? People don't even spend that long in the university. But can learn what we learn here in the university? There is a university course called "Mechanical engineering" Mechanical engineering? I've heard of that course. Those that study it, do you know where they end up? In an office, wearing a suit and tie. Just to change a light bulb, they'll need a consultant. There is nobody in all of Nigeria who knows about cars more than my boss, Ajentina. There was a day, someone brought a car here from America. A mechanical engineer, trained overseas. It was an old car from America they had given up on So this man brought it to Nigeria to salvage. Ajentina spent just a day on that car and he fixed it. That's how he revived the car. That car has been driving perfectly well on Nigerian roads. for the past two years now. mechanical engineering ... Two more years of apprenticeship and i will become a mechanical engineer. Air Peace. Next one is Aero. Pass me the number 12 spanner. It's not here. How do you mean? Check well. It's still not here. . Ah Erukutu! Continue cleaning the bolts. I'll be right back. Erukutu must have stolen the spanner. Little one. - Where is your boss, Ajentina? - He went to the... Who am i looking at? Ponmile! What are you doing here? What are you wearing? Who gave you the jumpsuit? Were you kidnapped? What are you doing here? My dad brought me here. Your dad brought you here? It's alright. Remain where you are. I'm calling your mother. I'm taking you back home. A little boy like you What is a little boy like you doing here? Ajoke. I am not alright! Can you tell me where your child is right now? What is he doing here? Ajoke, I have told you that your husband is an irrational person. If he isn't crazy, why would he drop a little boy off at a mechanics' yard to be an apprentice? Rich people as yourselves take their children abroad for summer. You said? You said? Now I understand. All right, all right. Okay, we'll talk later. Sorry! Hope you are not too cold? Have you eaten? Hope you are not hungry? Do you have money with you? Whatever they do to you, please endure it. There's nothing i can do to help you. Keep your money safe and don't let anyone steal from you. -Do you understand? -Madam, how can we help you? Where is your boss, Ajentina? He's fixing a car down there. Go and call him! Tell him my battery keeps running down. That's not a mechanic's work. It's the job of a re-wirer. Who asked for your opinion on that? If you know so much, why are you still here? Ponmile, bye, dear. It was Erukutu who stole the spanner, so I stole it back! But it's just a spanner. Just a spanner? It's not just a spanner. Spanner number 12 is the most frequently used spanners amongst mechanics. If you go to any mechanic yard, mechanics always hoard their size 12 spanner. Give me a hand here. Aero. Right on time. Next one will be Imo. Now, com and assist me. I can see you are not here to learn. You like her? Every apprentice in this yard likes Simi. Especially Obama. You mean the fellow president Trump deported from America? Yes. If he sees any other person showing interest in simi.. he will arrange for a half engine to be dropped on the person. Oh, you think I'm joking? What do you think happened to him? Otunba! See your head like an unripe pineapple. Kamoru. May it not be well with your mother. Otunba, why are you abusing my mother? She is a whore. Otunba, why would you call my mother a whore? Because she asked me for money. Otunba! Don't you know that when you buy an item, you have to pay? I have to go. Rashidi is waiting for me. You're still fixing the Governor's car? The car will run. Can you see him? Otunba used to be one of the best hands at brakes and clutches Then he started developing interest in Simi. So Obama arranged for a half engine to be dropped on his head. So better be careful. Imo. Don't worry, it comes with experience. Come and assist me. That one is tight now. Pliers. Wrench. Twelve. Size 12 spanner. -Who gave this spanner to me? -Ponle. Tiri! Do you know that you are a fool? Is this a size 12 spanner? I was just handing you the size 12 ... Take this. Fool Big fool. Have it, sir. - I am the one who gave you that one. - Ignorant fool. Are you not meant to guide him? He is very stubborn. - Call me Kamoru at the workshop. -OK. IYA SIMI FOOD CANTEEN Simi, thank you very much. Are you not eating Amala? [Tiri] Amala? He would rather have a burger. I'll eat amala. -[Simi] How many? -[Kamoru] Give him three wraps. Rather, give him four. If he can't finish it, I will assist him. Two, please. With the soup on top or by the side? On top. - Meat or fish? -Two meats. Okay, let us even imagine that somehow she agrees to be yours. What would you do with her? Have you ever been with a girl before? Have you... Don't you understand? Kamoru! I hope you are not teaching him bad things. [Kamoru] Sooner or later he will learn. Pure water or bottled water? Bottled water. [Tiri] Ponmile! Why don't you ask for a spoon? I'm sure you've never eaten with your hands. Your head is like that of a cockroach's backside. How do you know he hasn't used his hands before? Do you doubt me? Or am I lying against you? He has never eaten with his hands. Take a look at him He has lied to me this morning. Did you lie earlier today or not? He said there is a car more powerful and faster than Mercedes-Benz Guess what he called it? What did he call it? Butaggi. It is Bugatti. You are suffering from Ignorance. Can you see your life? A boy teaching you. So you have never heard of Bugatti in your entire life? So if qualified mechanics are called for a gathering, your incompetent self would also show up. Foolish boy! When I was still in America ... I used to see almost 30 Bugatti every day. [In English] For real, man [chuckles] [Tiri] Hold on, Obama If you insist Butaggi is the most expensive car, That means it is more expensive than the G-wagon, right? You are suffering from ignorance! Just one Bugatti can buy six G-wagons. -[Tiri] Six? -Yeah! A whole six! One, two, three, four, five, six... A whole six. Okay, Obama. Let me ask you this. If truly this Butaggi you are talking about... can buy six G-wagons, that means the car is worth about a million dollars? Exactly! Now you understand. Not a million naira, one million dollars? [Obama] Now you understand. I want to eat. I can tell you were brought from the village to this mechanic yard. -Amala. - Okay, sit. How many wraps would you eat? Ten! If you eat ten, what would the rest of us eat? Otunba, I'm serving you your usual four wraps. Four is good. Simi, I will marry you. But Otunba, I'm already your wife. Okay, let me just say this right now. Somebody came to our workshop and stole our size 12 spanner. I'm sending a clear warning to that person right now. Return that spanner. Return it to me, or I swear by the gods, terrible things will happen to that person. Erukutu! What is the problem? Why did you choose to reign curses when we are all eating? I've spoken my mind. That person should return my spanner. Simi, please, three wraps of amala. Meat or fish? None! It's the amala that will fill me, not the meat or fish. [woman] Take me there. - What's wrong with you? -Please, ma. Take me there. Foolish girl, bastard. [mother] Keep walking. Where are the workers here? Where are the people working here? Where are the workers here? Where are you? - Iya Mulika, what happened? - Just leave me alone. Iya Mulika. - Please leave me alone. - Calm down. Don't tell me to calm down. -Point out the guilty person! -[sobbing] -What is the problem? -Thank you very much. For the last three days, Mulika has been sleeping and sneezing heavily. I kept asking her what the problem was, but she insisted nothing was wrong. As soon as she eats, she starts vomiting and sleeping. She kept denying it whenever I asked her if she was pregnant So I took her to the hospital and got her tested. And the results are with me as we speak. Now ask her who impregnated her, because Mulika is pregnant. Tell us who slept with you that resulted in pregnancy. Talk! You better talk. So you've suddenly become dumb? Don't mind my mother, she wants to kill him. I will kill whoever impregnated you. Is the person amongst us here? Just explain everything to me. There's no need for any explanation. Hear me out. She already told me it's one of these mechanics. All she needs to do now is to point him out. Point out the person. Point out whoever impregnated you. Mummy Simi, I need assurance. [mother] Point him out, why are you so daft? I've just assured you, your mother won't kill him. Just tell me, who amongst these mechanics impregnated you? Me? Not me. Can't be me. It's No Trouble. So all those times you took ages to return from errands, You were busy causing trouble out there with her. It's enough, people! Let's take things easy. This is one of the things I warned about. I have previously warned all traders to keep an eye on their children. You just want to sabotage my effort in this yard. Now listen. - How old is this girl in question? - She is 16 years old Can you imagine, a 16-year-old getting pregnant? You are the one destroying this girl's life. - For asking her to hawk? -Yes! I'm still talking to you. Train your child well so they can give you peace of mind. We will settle this. Mulika's mother, Mulika, No Trouble and Taofeek, Come with me. Ponmile, wait for me at mama Simi's shop. You got pregnant for a useless person. [in English] Lovely voice. How long have you been standing there watching me? Not long. You can stare for Africa. What is your name? Ponmile. What are you doing here? The chairman said I should wait here. No, I mean what are you doing here at the mechanic yard? My dad brought me here. Have a seat. So where do you live? Island. I'm sure you attend a private school, right. I attend Hallifield College. Hallifield College? Wow, that's a good school. So, how did a boy from a wealthy background end up an apprentice in a mechanic yard? My father said I wasn't doing well enough in school. So he brought me here to experience some vocational training. and then decide what i want. So, do you like it here? It is okay. Enough to give up regular school? Med-View. What is that? Brother Kamoru knows the name of every airplane flying without even looking up. [scoffs] Kamoru has too much free time on his hands. Is this your work place? It's my mother's canteen. I'm only helping out. I just finished my National Diploma. I studied catering, but I don't like it at all. Yet you work in a canteen. Why am I even discussing my life with you, a little boy? So tell me, why are you lagging behind in school? I ... I don't really like studying. I have always preferred doing things with my hands. Have you told your parents? They wouldn't understand. If your dad brought you here, then he understands. So if you hate catering, why did you study it? I love music, but I can't do it. But you have a lovely voice. If that's all it takes, I would have been famous. Does your mother know? My mother? She wouldn't understand. It seems we are in the same boat. Would you ever consider marrying a mechanic? Well... if the man is honest, loving, hardworking and has drive, then why not? Becoming successful in life isn't easy. But you must also be honest with yourself. Whether you choose to stay in school or become an apprentice, both are options of hard work. I have lots of songs saved on my tablet. Are you on Facebook or Twitter? Well done, Ponmile. Good afternoon, Sir. Simi Simi... Well done. To learn is to know. The more you learn, the smarter you become. Ajentina told me you performed well under his supervision. I was glad to hear that. [laughs] God will honor you too and make you become better. Let's get to my friend's place. NEPA! [laughs] NEPA! NEPA! Chairman! Well done. How is work going? It's been a busy morning. How do you hear what people say with this loud music? Erukutu, reduce the volume. Not to waste your time, This is the young ward I mentioned to you earlier. I want him to stay with you for a while. His name is Ponmile. He is my ward. I remember. I hope he's ready to work. Don't underestimate him. Everything you know - I want you to teach him everything you know. - Okay, fine. He's a very good boy and you will enjoy his company. Ponmile, this is your boss. - I'll be on my way. - Take care, Chairman. Ponmile. Do you know the kind of job i do? You are a mechanic. No, I'm not a mechanic. I'm an auto electrician. Do you know what that means? It means I specialize in all electrical aspects in a car. That's why they call me NEPA. This car has a faulty alternator. What is the function of an alternator? -Erukutu -Yes, sir. Tell him the function of an alternator in a car. An alternator keeps the battery power charged Even when the engine is off. Like a UPS? We use one at home. So that the computer and TV stay on when there is power outage before switching to generator. That UPS is similar to an alternator. Do you understand? Erukutu. Yes, sir. Loosen the alternator from above and hand me the size 12 spanner. - Size 12? -Do you understand? Yes, sir. What is it again? -What are you looking for? -Sir. I think I may have misplaced the size 12 spanner. But I'll check. -Erukutu! -Sir. Are you alright? Are you saying that the size 12 is not here right now? Before the close of work today, If you don't hand over that spanner, I'll deal with you. You won't know the difference between the spark plug and a light bulb. I'll find it, boss. Go and fetch the spare one in my toolbox! Careless boy! You keep acting like a foolish person. Why do they call you Erukutu? Do i know for their fathers? When I first started my apprenticeship five years ago, I used to get into a lot of fights with other apprentices. And the fights caused me to roll on the ground covered in dust. They've been calling me Erukutu since then. Now let me ask you something. Was it Kamoru who stole my size 12 spanner? I do not know. You don't know what? Have you not been working with Ajentina since morning? You must have seen my spanner with them. - I didn't see any spanner. -Hypocrite. I know it is Kamoru. My instincts tell me it is Kamoru. He's a thief! Without looking, can you tell me the airplane flying by? What concern is that of a mechanic? Brother Kamoru knows the name of every plane flying over without looking up. Kamoru has too much time on his hands. The people carrying coolers over there. What is happening there? Tiday is Goke's graduation. Is it a party? Are you kidding me? Graduation is a big deal here. After five to seven years of apprenticeship, graduating is a huge day we all dream of. When is your own graduation? Another couple of years, God willing. [man] Where's NEPA? Where's NEPA? Where's NEPA? I pushed it. Thank you, Otunba. Emeka, what is the problem? - Where's my money? - Just have this. NEPA, what's going on? I don't like what's going on here. [NEPA] please what is the problem. Are you asking me what the problem is, NEPA? [in English] You didn't see my car? Were you not the one that fixed this car? The car is malfunctioning. What's going on? Your car... Malfunctioning? [NEPA in English] How come? You've caused my car to malfunction. -Please wait, let me have a look. -Have I ever wronged you? -Not at all, Emeka. [in English] Let me check let me check. Okay, okay. Now turn on the indicator let me see. Now try the headlights let me see. Push the horn and let me see now. [NEPA] This is a big problem. - Can you see what I'm talking about? -Yeah. Can you see what I'm talking about? What kind of problem have i gotten myself in today, for God's sake? Emeka, it seems the brain box of your car is malfunctioning. How come? I also don't understand. [in English] Now listen to me NEPA, and listen real good. NEPA! You don't want to see the other side of me. . You don't want to see the other side of me, NEPA. [in English] I don't want to see. See. I want you to do something for me. Order Uber right now, so we don't keep the ladies waiting. Do you understand? NEPA! I'm not happy with what you're doing. - I've never wronged you. -I know. Do you know how much I bought this car? Of course, it's a Benz. I bought this car brand new. NEPA, I don't like this. -[in English] NEPA, fix my car for me. -I will fix it. you heared me? Fix my car for me. I will fix it, don't worry. I don't want to hear stories when i come back around 4:00 pm. I'll fix it, don't worry. What could have gone wrong with this car? Baba NEPA. I'm sure everything he said confused you. - Do you understand anything he said? - Do you That's how we talk in America. You see that guy? I knew him in America. - We both lived in Alabama. [in English] Yeah, for real. Come on, get out of here! That was why you were deported from America. You are suffering from ignorance. You're an illiterate. Get out! Look at this gorilla-looking idiot, that is supposed to be locked up in the zoo. You're an illiterate! Yo never be granted a visa to America. Boss, what are we going to do concerning this car? Bring my diagnostic machine. Let's run a test first. What does it mean for a car to gave a brain box malfunction? These latest models of cars have electrical settings that are unique. And once the wirestouch each other, The car's brain box starts malfunctioning. What causes that? That is what I am about to find out, so i can know what to do next. That looks like a Playstation device. A Computer game. This is also a computer but it's not a game. Do you understand? It will take a while, but it will explain where the problem lies in the car. What about the alternator I asked you to fix? Go and continue fixing it. In one way or another, I will get blamed for all these. Were you the one who tampered with the brain box? No, but NEPA will blame me anyway. That's the bad thing about being an apprentice. You'll be blamed for everything. What happens if you're found guilty? My boss can decide to add an extra year to my apprenticeship. That's like repeating a class. Exactly, that is how it is. It is the same as repeating a class. What do you think happened to Otunba? Brother Kamoru said Otunba was showing interest in Simi. Therefore, brother Obama arranged for a half engine to be dropped on his head. What a liar. What nonsense is that? That's a total fabrication. Do you know how long Otunba has been an apprentice? 12 years! - 12 years? -Yeah! As an apprentice? It's been 12 years. Can't you see how he misbehaves? It's enough to make anyone mad. But boss, can't we improvise? Maybe we should just change the coil. We would still have to take it to ladipo market for repairs. Even if we change it, it'll still get spoilt. Then the customers will, in turn, blame us for not doing a proper job. They would rather repair a damaged part than spend on a brand new part. -Erukutu. -Boss. When I instructed you to replace the fuse of this car, did you tamper with the brain box? No, I had no business with the brain box. -Are you sure? -I am very sure. You warned me never to touch the brain box of any car unless you are present. - Were you always by this car? - Yes, boss. Aside from when I went to purchase some fuse. Boss. What is a brain box? Good question. No human exists without a brain. Likewise, cars don't exist without a brain box. All other parts of the car depend on the brain box to function. And if anything goes wrong with the brain box of a car, other parts of the car will also become faulty. It works just like a human being. No human being exists without a brain. Cars don't exist without a brain box. -Ponmile. -Sir. Get me a 15-amp fuse. -NEPA! -Mr. Emeka. - NEPA! -Mr. Emeka. -NEPA! -Mr. Emeka. - I hope you have good news for me? -Yes. - I have run a full diagnosis on the car. -okay. And I have fixed it. It should now work properly. NEPA! NEPA! NEPA! How many times I call you now? Three times. Are you assuring me you've fixed the car? -Everything. So start the car now let's confirm. Hi boy. So handsome. -[Emeka exclaiming] -[NEPA laughing] NEPA! -I believe you. I believe you. -I know. NEPA, you're the man. You see NEPA ? - You deserve some accolades. -Yeah. NEPA, what did I say? You deserve some accolades. - Now you've got identity. -Yes, yes. -You get identity now. -Yes. - Not everybody get identity. - But this has proven you have identity -NEPA. -Ah, trust me. An adage says, "He who works must eat." NEPA, have this. -You know how I do my thing. -I know. -NEPA! -Mr. Emeka! - NEPA! -Mr. Emeka! -[Emeka] You correct. -[NEPA] I know. Oh, baby. How y'all like me now? How y'all like me now? Imagine if this car didn't start. How would we have had fun? Let's get going. Booty, booty. Booty, booty, booty. - NEPA! -Mr. Emeka! You've made me very happy. I will see you later. -Okay. Thank you very much. God bless you. -Alright. May your enemy be doomed. Enjoy yourself. Call me the amala seller. There's money now. Emeka! [laughs] Emeka! -How are you? -Good afternoon, Sir. NEPA. -NEPA! NEPA! NEPA! -My chairman! Well done. You eventually fixed that car. My chairman, It wasn't easy. Give me some of that. - How has ponmile fared so far? - He really tried. He has a sound mind. He catches on so fast. -Didn't I tell you? -Yes you said so. I told you not to judge a book by its cover. He's my ward, and I know how smart he is. Thank you so much. I've come to take him to another location. - Okay, no problem. - Ponmile, let's go. -Take care. - So you won't be giving me anything? Erukutu! Let's finish work on that RAV4. How has your experience been so far? It was okay. Are you sure it was okay? Your father called. He asked after your well being, and I told him you were okay. This morning I noticed this morning that you were angry with your father. When he dropped you off. But as a parent, It is our utmost desire that our children excel. Your father didn't bring you here to punish you. He wants you to grow in knowledge and experience. Do you understand now? Let's go to Taofeek's workshop. Taofeek. Chairman Well done, Taofeek. No, not today. Ah, I haven't said anything yet. Chairman, you don't have to say anything. I know why you're here. My answer is no. Let him stay here, even if it's for a while. My chairman! Look at what I have on my plate. I'm also the only one working. My apprentice, No Trouble is gone. [chairman] Taofeek. Forget about your apprentice. From now on, I must never see him in this vicinity again. Do you understand? Chairman, I have no time to teach anyone today. Ponmile. Let's go to Banji, the panel beater That part is not properly done. What did you say? That side of the car is not smooth. Let's go, Ponmile. Chairman, can I see you briefly? What is it? Just a moment. - You said there is no time to teach the boy? -I'm Sorry. The rough side you observed, Smoothen it yourself. Use your palm. Take this and sprinkle some water on it. Smoothen the rough side. Keep water away from that paper. This is a nose cover for protecting the nose when spraying. Look at this. It is for spraying. We mix the paint in here. Then you spray. Keep an eye on how it's done. Is it done? No. As you can see, we haven't touched the front part. After completing the sandpaper work, we will give it first coat. After it dries uo tomorrow, I will apply a second coat. Then it's ready. So, it will look like a new car? Chairman was right about you. You learn very fast. Well done. What about the car in the oven this morning? That work is done. That is KLM. Brothe Kamoru knows all the names of each airplane that passes by without looking. Kamoru is jobless. Get me fufu from Iya Simi's canteen. I made a mistake eating just a wrap of amala earlier. Buy fufu ... and Egusi soup with a meat. So what time will you be here? I'm not going anywhere. We are closing by 5:00 pm. I already told my mother I'd no longer be available after 5:00pm. I can not wait. I can't wait. My boss, Taofeek sent me to buy fufu. Is Brother Obama your boyfriend? Who told you that? Don't pay attention to the rumor mongers in this yard. What's your concern anyway? Are we dating? Not yet. Not yet. Don't let my fiancée hear you say that. Do you have a boyfriend? So, do you really think I have a good singing voice? You have the voice of an angel. You are such a sweet talker. . You're going to break many hearts in the future. After we spoke earlier, you got me thinking. Music may just be my calling. But I have not been paying attention to it. That's good. The people will like you. Just because you like me right? You should also consider what path you intend to take in life. Dont rule out any option until you are sure of what you want. What if I decide to become a mechanic? Then follow it through with all your heart. If you want to go back to school, focus on your studies. If you're going to be an apprentice, do your best. Some of the apprentices here were once in this phase. But with patience, they scaled through. When I grow up, I want to marry a woman just like you. You're such a sweet talker. Can I slide into your DM? Can you see what's written on it? It's these two again! That's enough. Are you both tired or are you just starting? Kamoru! You are senseless. I'm adding six more months to his apprenticeship. [NEPA] Erukutu. Erukutu. For also fighting in the workplace, I'm also adding six more months to your apprenticeship. Now what caused the fight? It's this thief. He stole this from our toolbox. I did not steal it. I only borrowed it. [Ajentina] with whose permission? Then that's stealing. Is that why you're fighting? Over a spanner? Not just that. He stole the spanner. Therefore he definitely tampered with the brain box. I swear by the god of iron, if i truly tampered with the brain bix, may thunder strike my parents. I admit I took the spanner. But I swear I didn't touch the brain box. Kamoru is my apprentice. And I've never seen him misbehave before. But if he swears he didn't do it, then he didn't do it. Everybody should get back to their duty post. . He said he didn't take it. Everybody back to your jobs! Everyone, back to your jobs! I can tell this fight is obviously not about the spanner. -Answer me! -[NEPA] Simi? A woman is the cause of your rift? -[Kamoru] I liked her first! -She liked me first! - She liked me first! - She liked me first! Shut up, both of you! The lady you both are fighting over, Do you know who she is courting? Good evening, sir. -Goke. -The celebrant. Congratulations! Erukutu! How are you? We're happy to see you. - What happened to both of you? - An engine just fell on their heads. -[Goke] And who is this little man here? - Our latest apprentice. I hope you are all waiting for the celebration? Of course we are. -Okay. Please excuse me, sir. -Alright. Boy, let's go. Let me also go with you. - Take it! -Bring it! Thief. You're also a thief. If you try this nonsense with me next time, i'm going to destroy you. As for me, next time I'il beat you till you split in two. Was that why you were screaming like a woman when I slammed you on the floor? You were also throwing punches like my grand mother. Your head is like the rear end of a carburetor. - Your head looks like the front of a bus. - Next time, you are finished! Keep quiet! Thank you. Goke! Today is your graduation. This is honey. It's sweet when you taste it. - Your life will be sweet like honey. -[all] Ameen. This is kola nut. It repels death and illness. - May it repel death from your household. -[all] Ameen. - May it repel illness from your household. -[all] Ameen. This is bitter kola Bitter kola births longevity. May it grant you longevity. Ameen This is the alligator pepper. The alligator pepper protects its own with the pod. - May you be protected from suffering. -Ameen. -May you not suffer in life. -Ameen. This is aadun. If you give a child aadun, how does it taste? [all] It's sweet. - May your life be sweet. -Ameen. - May your life be sweet. -Ameen. May you not encounter death in your quest. Ameen. May this new phase of your life be lifelong. Ameen - May you prosper. -Ameen. - May all I have said come to pass -Ameen. This is salt. How would a food taste without salt? It will be tasteless. - May your life not be bland. -Ameen. Ameen. This is sugar. It's also sweet. -May you also have sweetness. -Ameen. This is a mixed herb. Goke, listen carefully. Today you become a graduate. Now you're a boss. This is a warning: You don't covet your boss' apprentice. It's a curse! It's a curse! God will provide apprentices that will work under you. Ameen. -May you not be unfortunate. -Ameen. You've become a boss today. - [Ajentina] Goke! Goke! This is a spanner. Whatever you loosen with it, will come off with ease. Ameen. And whatever you fasten with it will stick. Ameen. May you not be unfortunate. -Can you all see? -We see. This is Goke's certificate. Goke! Can you now see that in perseverance there's success? Your success today will never turn to sorrow. Ameen. This is your certificate. - There's no time to waste here. -Baba Wole! Baba Wole! Wole. -How are you? -I'm fine. Did you eat? Did you see me dancing? Yeah, you danced beautifully. Everybody clapped for me. Yeah. I also clapped for you. I also fixed a car today. You fixed a car today? What type of car? Mercedes-Benz. Benz? So what exactly did you fix in the Benz? I fixed ... Brain... ? Brain bix! Yes. I fixed the brain box. Brain box! That was fine of you. That's my boy. That's good of you. I'm proud of you. I'm going back to dance now. No problem. Go and enjoy yourself. You called him Wole. I thought his name was Otunba? Ponmile! I named him Oluwole. I'm his father. But all the apprentices call him Otunba. Wole is his name. Ah, there's your dad. - Chairman! - Mr. Ogidan! -Welcome. -Ponmile! -Well done, sir. -How are you? - I'm fine, thank you, sir. -You're welcome. -How are you? Did you enjoy yourself? - Yes, sir. I hope he didn't trouble you? Not at all On the contrary, at every place of designation, be it the mechanic's workshop, NEPA's workshop, the panel beater's workshop, They all sang his praises that he's a smart boy. All right, sir. Thank you. Ponmile! So what do you want to do now? I want to continue my apprenticeship. Was that not why you brought him here? You thought bringing him here this morning would terrify him. But that's not the case. That was exactly what I thought when I brought my son, Wole, 12 years ago. You don't want to go to school again? I still want to go to school. But I want to spend my weekends and holidays at my apprenticeship. [chairman] There's no problem. There will always be a place for you here. -Thank you, sir. - Okay, Mr. Ogidan. -Thank you, sir. -Okay. Ponle! Have a nice time. Thank you, sir. Air France. How did you know? Experience. Experience.
