But before I go, can you tell everyone here how you could afford a four thousand dollar purse given your financial standing. Teni, get up and let's leave this place now. Did you buy a bag for four thousand... - Two million naira? - No baby, not here please. Is she telling the truth? Are you forty-six? Darling, let's step out. Why do you want to step out?

Bullying, who is bullying who? She's five years my senior I can't be bullying her. -Hey -[AYO CHUCKLES] Yes, you know what? This is proof that my husband bought your wife that purse that she's prancing around with. [IN PIDGIN] A purse that doesn't fit what you're wearing. - [BELS] Teni, Teni! - [TENI] Yes. And while we're at it he gave her two million naira on wednesday. I'm guessing it was for this party. ANd come to think of it, my husband is shagging your wife.

Did you tell your darling husband that you've had six abortions. - Eh... - [CHUBI IN IGBO] My God. Did you tell him you couldn't get rid of the seventh because the doctor was scared for your life? Stop it! Did you tell him that you carried the seventh one to term. And that child today is thirteen years old. - Stop it! - Take it easy. Did you tell him... that those six abortions were as a result of you being a pornstar. - Of you being a pornstar. - Shut up! -In Italy -Shut up! - Did you? - Shut up, you're lying. And as a stupid teenager you agreed to film without protection. - [ENEH] Hey! - Did you?

Trust me, you haven't heard the last of this. Oh really, go to hell Teni. - Go to hell, that's where you belong. - It's okay. - This is... - Leave me. - And you, you told her. - Hmmm... You're supposed to be my friend I trusted you. I'm sorry, I just said it light heartedly. I don't know why she will bring it up here now. why? Oh, since we're all being light hearted I guess I can tell Chubi now that you're sleeping with your chef. Hey... - [IN IGBO] What did you say? - Yes Chubi. Your sugar baby poporipopo as you fondly call her is sleeping with your chef, John. Yes. No... it's not true. She says you're an embarrasment to her. You humiliate her when you guys go out because of your lack of class. Yes. And even when you make love to her your moaning is very local. -Ah-ah -Me? My baby poporipopo, my baby poporipopo... My sugar, hey! Hey, poporipopo! And when you're done you sleep off and start snoring.

Is it a problem to come to your party? Wha... take it easy. Yes dear take it easy. - I'm sure this is all just temptation. - [OMOH] Eh-eh What kind of temptation? This seems like a set up to me, you planned to ruin my day. Ruin your day? Set up? why? Nobody is ruining your day or setting you up Omoh. So how do you explain the progression of events so far? How? It's just... coincidence. Oh... it's a coincidence right? So here's a big toast to coincidence. Ahh... this will go down in history as the best birthday party ever. Omoh, Omoh let me take you back...

She forced us into pornography and threatened to use it against us everytime we complained After my sixth abortion. Yes, my sixth abortion. The doctor who was also under my madams employ offered to help me escape. When I got to Nigeria and found out I was pregnant, I didn't have a choice Bels I had to keep him. And then I met you, I knew I had to have a fresh start. I'm sorry okay... I'm sorry that I did not have the courage to tell you about my past. But are we going to allow this to ruin everything we worked hard to build? Let's not forget Bels, this is not about me. All of this is certainly not about me. Bels. [DOOR OPENS] Honey. Bels. Ah!

I don't know whether to believe you or not. You... are brilliant at this. You lie well. Forty six. Why lie about that? Oh I'm sorry. When I met you I realized I was five years older than were. I didn't want to loose you. So I panicked and I lied. And I'm sorry. Listen, I know you hate me right now. No, no, no..I don't hate you. I can never do. You're my wife after all. Right? Right. -But you hate lies -Yes I do. And that's why I need you to come clean with me. If you tell the truth? This marriage can be saved. But if you don't... I'm sorry but we have to go our separate ways. Did you sleep with my friend Bels? Maro please, please don't make me do this. I said I'm sorry. I need you to think carefully. Before you answer because Bels was here and he told me everything. He did? And tell me the truth for once in your life. [EXHALES DEEPLY] If he told you everything then... Because! Because I need to hear it from you. I love you enough to want to salvage what's left of us. Okay. Okay. Alright. You know I love you. I just wanted to appreciate you for everything you've done. Everything you've done for me. Well... Just know. That I am here for you. Anything you need... Any help... Uhhh... Hmmm... Omoh. I see you came prepared. I do what I must. You're beautiful. ANd you're irressistable [KISSES] Please. Please I'm sorry. How long has this been going on? Just five months. Just five months? Of doing it over... over and again. My God. Why on earth will you shame me like this? What did I ever do to you? Nothing Maro, you did nothing, I was foolish. And I did it not because I love him. It was just to show gratitude for all he had done. Or for giving us assistance when we needed it. I mean of everyone I asked he was the only one who agreed to help. How many of my other friends did you approach? Almost all of them. And if all of them had given you money like Bels? Would you have shown the same gratitude to all of them right? No, no, no, I won't do it. I don't know what came over me Maro. Please. I see. Ah... thank you. Thank you for being truthful for once in your deceitful life. You're disgraceful I'm ashamed to even call you my wife! Maro please. Guess what? I lied to get you to tell the truth. Bels didn't tell me anything. If you like him enough you will go to him and tell him I'm coming for him! And as for you, I will encourage you to run for your dear life. Because what you have done may cause me to end it. Please Please Maro, please. - You think I'm playing? - No - I'll kill you. - No. -I'll kill you -No. -I'll kill you -No! [MARO SCREAMS] No. [MARO SCREAMS] [OMOH GASPS] [COUGHS] What if they had died from that seizure episode? Would you have been happy even? No Ayo. Why would I want my children dead? I don't know, you tell me. I could never hurt my children. But you did dear. You hurt them. Not intentionally. Do you know how many mothers have killed their children unintentionally? Is that how you look at me now? Do I look like I'm capable of murder? I don't know what to think. You went too far. All for sex? You just don't get it do you? If it were all about sex, I have my pick from the other men like my friends did. But I miss us. I miss the times we spend together. I miss the times we just used to talk about everything and nothing. That's it. I guess that's my sin and... that's where it all led me to. I'm sorry. Look I uhm... [CLEARS THROAT] I spoke to doctor Ben. And he said that you've not been attending the counselling sessions he set up for you. You need help rose. You're battling with a serious case of post-partum depression. I don't need help Ayo. I need you. It's so easy to judge people based on all of this but... you need to realise you have a part to play in all of this as well. Or didn't the doctor tell you that as well? [SNIFFLES ] [SIGHS] He did. And I apologise. I will make out more time for my family. For you. Hmm... Now... I can only imagine what you've been going through as a house wife. You give so much to the running of the house and I appreciate you for that. Hmm... We will make this work. I promise you. Sure about this? Yes my love. I'm very sure. [CHUCKLES] Now come here. Hold that thought. [DOOR CLOSES] - [ROSE] Ayo, love you. - [AYO] I love you too baby. [ROSE] After this we still have one more oh... [AYO EXCLAIMS] [IN YORUBA] I think you should take it easy.
