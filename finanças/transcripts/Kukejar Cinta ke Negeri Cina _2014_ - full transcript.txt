PT OGEN Congratulations Welcome. To all students and their families,... ... please proceed to the senate hall. Imam. Yes, I'm sorry. Come here. Where were you? What took you so long? You know that you have Mom and Dad's invitations. Why can't you ever... ... appreciate time a bit? Please change. Mature a little. Here's the invitation. We can enter now. Is Imam not graduating together? Dad, please. Let's go. Looks like someone will be lonely. Don't worry, I'll keep you company. So, you are only telling me that your girlfriend graduated? That's not it, Dad. I promise you, I'll finish this semester or the next, okay? It's been two years since you said so. Don't lie to me. You think I don't know? Just because I'm stupid, doesn't mean you can lie. I feel like pulling your hair. But, Dad, college takes time. Moreover, that professor has something against me. Who's the professor? I'll give him a piece of my mind. Excuse me, Widya is calling you and telling you to go inside. Yes, thank you. What's wrong, Dad? - What did Imam say? - Your brother is such a snob. He hung up on me! So annoying. I don't get why he won't learn. He's already in college! Have a drink, Honey. I'd like to talk to Imam. Please, let us talk for a moment. - Dad... - Go inside. Go to your room. Widya. Understood. You can attend college once your brother graduates. But study properly, don't follow his steps. It's not easy to earn money. Right, Honey? If God blesses us with some fortune, you can all go to college. Wherever you want, right? Come on, Honey, calm down. Have some more. You keep making me drink. What, am I a fish? I'd like to ask. You want to ask when I'm going to propose to Widya, right? What? Propose? You're jobless, you know. Are you crazy? What do you want to ask, then? When are you breaking up with her? Dad, I heard that. I'll excuse myself, then. Your name is Imam, correct? Become the imam then, lead the prayer. In the family praying room. Take your piercings off. I will go cleanse myself. I'll wait over there. Imam. Where are you going? Are you running away? What? - I... - What? I want to finish my thesis at the dorm. Alright. If you aren't yet able to lead the family prayer,... ... it's alright. Just, don't forget to pray. But don't tell your father. Kukejar Cinta ke Negeri Cina - Thank you. - You're welcome. This is yours. I'm sure you're out of money your father sent you from Jakarta. Honey, have a bite here. - But I eat her all the time. - This tastes different. It tastes better, right? So, how about your thesis? Going smoothly. You can even lie about your thesis, can't you? What about other things? Ouch! Where are you looking at? You don't have to show off. Are you preaching me? You, who can't even pray properly? Honey... Honey, wait. Listen to me. You know that already. Listen. If you don't change,... ... Dad will never approve of our relationship. Towards the next step. That, exactly. Because the red light is taking too long. Why won't you ever listen to me? - You're so mean! - Alright. I'm serious now. - Here, here. - Honey... Widya! Is your break over? Yes, I was just going to go back. Don't forget to pick me up at 18.30 sharp. Don't be late. Professor Room Sir, I'm coming for thesis councelling. Do you know what time it is? It's past 14.00. The schedule is over. Come again tomorrow. Who told you to come late? But still. Just because he's professor,... ... he's making a schedule as he pleases. We're consumers. Consumers are supposed to be kings. Damn, I died. Don't complain to me. Go to the dean's office. Widya Honey Damn. Hello? Yes, Honey. Yes, I'm about to leave now. I'm on my way, alright? Alright, see you. Go pick her up already. Hey, Imam! Hotel Chrome Widya, you're still here? Dimas? Actually, yes. Why don't I give you a ride? No, someone is picking me up, he should still be on the way. I just can't bear seeing such a pretty girl... ... waiting by herself this late. Let me give you a ride? No, it's okay. Sorry, I'm late. Okay. I'm leaving. Me too. Congratulations, then. Where were you? Why are you so late? - The usual. - What, usual? Who was that? Dimas. Looks like Dimas has a talent to teach religion. You're calling him more endearingly suddenly. He'd sometimes send me Quran quotes. Such nice words. Let me read the newest one. "And seek help to God through patience and prayer,... ... and indeed, it is difficult,... ... except for the humbly submissive." - What's wrong? - Nothing. Don't worry, I only consider him an older brother. He's more mature. Maybe this is what Widya tells her father,... ... "He's only someone who gives me a ride." What's wrong with you? You're making fun of me now? Making fun of you is my purpose in life. Widya seems farther now, doesn't she? What do you mean? I mean,... ... her "older brother" is mature, a manager, and religious. If that other guy goes to her place, he'd say to her father,... ... "Let's pray together, I'll lead." Unlike you. No way. She'll still choose me. "I only consider him an older brother." Do what you want. I'll just go home. You're such a kid, Imam! Are you leaving me to play by myself? Hey! Is this it? Not bad. Not bad? This is great. Take a look. I've been here a few times and I'm still impressed. - It's huge, isn't it? - Who is that? He's Admiral Zheng He, one of my ancestors. - Come on. - Am I allowed to go in, anyway? You aren't having your period, right? Of course you can. I get it now. You're here to ask for some blessing, right? So that your thesis can proceed smoothly? Admit it. - What, you're mad now? Such a coward. - Hey. This is God's home. I come so that everything is smooth sailing. Unlike you, never grateful. The moment you're in trouble,... ... "Why doesn't God love me?" Stop! Don't. Sorry. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam. Hi. Hi. Are you by yourself? Can I help you with pictures? Should I take of you? Let me introduce myself first. My name is Ridwan Imam Fadhil, just call me Imam. No worries, it's alright. Wait here, okay? Wait. - Billy, help me. - What is it? - Help me. Stand up, hurry. - What is it? Wait a second. Hurry up! - Wait a second. - Come on. - Imam, my shoes. - You can do that later. Hurry up, Billy. - This is her. - My shoes. Do that later, okay? She can't speak Indonesia. Since you're both Oriental,... ... I'm sure you understand her language. Do you think all Chinese people speak Chinese? But you keep watching those kugh fu movies. So, if I watch Animal Planet, I'll understand monkey language? - You're right. - What's with you? She's smiling. So pretty. Come on, step forward. Hi. We're back. My name is Jia Li. I'm from Beijing. I actually understand some Indonesian,... ... just a little bit, I can't speak fast. She speaks Indonesian! But she couldn't before, that's why I went to get you. Hi. So... I introduced myself already. My name is Imam. He's Billy. Since you're from Beijing... Yes. If you don't have a tour guide yet,... ... how about we take you around Semarang? - Do you agree? - I can't. I have counselling. Since he can't, then, it's just the two of us. - Touring Semarang? - Yes. Let's go. Come. This is Chinatown. I know. My grandfather used to live here. Really? Yes. Allahu akbar... Jia Li, what are you looking for? It's the call for prayer. Where's the nearest mosque? I know a good place to eat here. Why don't we eat? Let's go. Sorry, but thank you. What? Jia Li? Don't you want to eat? Hey? Hayya'alas-shalaah... Imam, let's pray together now. Then we go to the restaurant. Hayya 'alal-falaah... Where are you, Imam? Have you had your lunch? Don't forget to pray I'm sure you're reminding Imam to pray and have lunch. How do you know? Because you've told me. That you're often reminding him of little things,... ... as proof of your love. But Imam, how do I say it? If he needs to be reminded about God,... ... how about things with fellow humans? I didn't hear anything from you all day, you know? I'm doing research for my thesis. Is it okay for you to go home by yourself? I'm sorry. You aren't lying to me, are you? Of couse not. I won't lie to you. I need to get back. Talk to you later. Bye. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Do you still have relatives here? Relatives? No. I just wanted to see this place. Back when Admiral Zheng He's ship anchored here,... ... my great-grandfather, Chen Chiang Hong, was the able seaman. I heard from my grandfather, Semarang has it all. It has land, sea. Is that true? That's true. It's complete. Especially with you. What do you mean? - Forget it. - Okay. - Jia Li. - Yes? Do you have a boyfriend? What do you mean? How do I explain this? This is you, okay? Boyfriend. Relationship. I see. I don't date. She's single! Are you looking for trouble? That's like having an affair! Who is having an affair? Are you crazy? - I'll have one chicken noodles. - Okay. - Ms. Widya, I'll go ahead. - Okay. Widya. Always thinking positive calms you down, you know. But my boyfriend is too much. I can't get hold of him. Why is meeting my of boyfriend... ... harder than meeting my superior? But I'm your superior. You can call me, text me, meet me, whenever you want. Alright, why don't I take you home today? No, it's okay. I can go home by myself. I'll take the public transportation. Excuse me. Assalamu'alaikum. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Imam, the signs of an affair... ... is being able to lie without feeling guilty. Just like you now. Do you know what overreacting is? That's you. I'm just taking her around Semarang. Is that wrong? No, right? Although it was fun being with her. Who were you with, Imam? Hey, Billy... I won't intrude your internal bussiness. Billy... Internet Cafe Billy... No Smoking Honey... Are you ready to answer? Yes, I only was going out with Billy. Seriously. I only go with Billy or with you, right? There's no other, right? Are you not lying? No, Honey. I swear, I'm not lying. You're lying. I know. And now I'm even more convinced,... ... because you aren't even chasing to explain yourself. I'll pay you later. Peanuts, Mungbeans, Bread - What's with you? - There. Don't go so fast. I'm tired. Do you think I'm not? Chasing is wrong, but not chasing is even wronger. You're right. It's just like watching soap opera. This is interesting. I only go out with either you or Billy. There's no other. You're so annoying. Hey, Brother! Cut it out! Wedang Plampitan Some friend you are, Billy. - Come with me. - I'm not playing along. - I'm not playing along. - No. You have to. Now you're our witness. Tell her. What? - Hurry up, tell her. - Yes. So... What is it about, Imam? What should I say? You're the same. Liars. - Sir. - Now I'm a liar too? Me, this pure, white, kind man? You're looking for trouble. This is the end. Thank God. That's for you too, right? Thank you, Miss. My parents are good and healthy. Dimas? Assalamu'alaikum. Before greeting, say that first. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Were you here the whole time? Yes, because I couldn't bear seeing you take public transportation. So I followed you here... ... and used the opportunity to do the prayer. Widya, he led the prayer. His reading was smooth, with such a melodious voice. I'm impressed. Alright, I'll go inside. Feel free to chat. Or have a talk about your future, maybe? I trust you, Dimas. - Thank you. - Widya. Yes? Treat him right. Alright, have a seat. - Please. - Thank you. Please. I'd like to tell you something, Widya. What is it? So... I feel like we click. You're a good girl, I'm also a good man. So, hopefully, we match. Okay. - Can I excuse myself? I'm tired. - No problem. I had a long day. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. I'll give you a special chance. You may have three councellings this week. It's a three, right? Maybe you're lucky. Although I'm not too sure. Please revise. Imam, I've been approved! It's approved! It's a go! Here, this. I'm finally done with this damned thesis. Can't do. How come? We enrolled together, so we have to graduate together. What? Do you want to go to hell together too? No way. It's a go! - Hello, Miss. - Hello, Sir. - Can I help you? - Yes. Can you patch me through to room 348? - Excuse me, could you be Imam? - Yes. If you are, the guest at room 348 left this for you. Widya! Widya, where are you going? - I need to reload my phone. - Let me take you. No, I'll walk there. It's close by. But Widya, it's hot outside. You're a lady, too. It's not proper to walk alone. It's okay. I have no ulterior motive. I just want to keep my promise to your father. Come on. IN Imam - Hello, assalamu'alaikum. - Hey, Widya. Listen, I'd like to talk about last night. Where are you now? I'm not at the office right now. I see. How about you let me know when you're back? I'll be back in one or two hours. That's fine. Just let me know. Bye. In - Widya, I... - Yes? Just a moment. Hello. Alright, Sir. I'm going back now. Yes. Looks like we'll have to cancel our lunch. Mr. Sofyan asked me to return to the hotel. But I'll still take you to the phone shop over there. Please have a seat, Ms. Jia Li. Your room is being prepared. - Thank you. - You're welcome. Jia Li. Imam. Sorry, I had to notify you through a letter. That's alright. I was just confused. When I got there, you were gone. I thought you left me for China. - My heart hurts. - Broken heart? That's the word. Broken heart. I didn't know what to do... ... when I learned that you'd checked out there. I thought there was a tremor. Like an earthquake. It hurt here. - My heart sunk. - What do you mean? - I don't understand. - I mean,... ... I still want to see you. I enjoyed being with you. - We're both single, so... - Imam. Honey... - Why did you stop? - Nothing. We're both single, so we have to get together. That's what you want to tell her, right? Here I'm always defending you from my father. Honey, please don't. You're too much. You never use your brain. I have no more reason to keep you. Honey... Widya! Widya! Single? did you say you're single? Widya is already putting you ahead. You're two-timing her, you know? - What? Are you denying that? - I won't two-time... ... if Widya and her father make me comfortable like Jia Li does. So you do have affair in mind. - You... - Say what you want. Imam! Hey, you thick head! Allahu akbar... Allahu akbar... What? I will pray. But if I get my calling. - Relax, man. - I don't understand. That is your obligation as a Muslim. I know that. You know, you're starting to sound like Widya. Religion can't be forced. Widya shouldn't do that. Jia Li is right. What? You're only saying that as a justification. But it is right! - Imam, Billy, I'm done. - Oh... - Let's go. Let's eat. - Let's go. Jia Li. Like that. Damn. Billy, is Imam alright? What do you mean? I mean, I saw earlier, Imam had a fight... ... with a woman. - Widya? - Yes. Widya. You know, Imam and Widya were having lover's quarrel. It's normal. Don't worry. Try this. Tahu Petis. It's delicious. It's Semarang speciality. No! You can't! This is for you. - Thank you. - No! Don't give it to him. - Why? - He only gets this. That's for you. - Here, have half. - I know! - Do you understand? - Delicious. Thank you for giving me a ride. You're welcome. - I'm going in. Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Hey, you... Imam, this is a nice mosque. - I like it. - Yes. - It's big. - Yes. I always like to watch people's expressions coming out... ... after a prayer. What's the difference? Isn't it normal? I find it extraordinary. They're willing to stop activities only to pray. Assalamu'alaikum. Excuse me, Miss, Sir. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - I'd like to offer some books. Here you go. Please have a look. Complete Guide to Shalat, The History of Demak Mosque - Thank you. Assalamu'alaikum. - You're welcome. Wa'alaikumsalam. This is for you. Complete Guide to Shalat with Prayers This one is for me. - Thank you. - You're welcome. - Careful, it's hot. - Okay. It's delicious. By the way, Imam,... ... how is your thesis going? Thesis... It's going smoothly. Alhamdulillah. If God is good, I'll start chapter four. Always think positive of Allah. Jia Li. If... ... there is someone... ... asking for your hand,... ... is... ... one of the requirements... ... having finished the thesis first? Don't laugh. This is serious. Sorry. If anyone would propose to me,... ... I'd like to ask for a Quran,... ... as a reminder that I have to be on the right way. Amen. Complete Shalat Good! This... Good! Okay! Well... Accepted! Yes! Two chapters, man! This is crazy! Mr. Munawar really is most handsome. No K-pop artist can beat him. Thank you, Imam. Sure. Mr. Munawar smiled at me! A sexy smile, at that! Why are you happy being smiled at by a man? - Which chapter are you in? - Four. Four is an unlucky number. Change it to 3A. I don't care. Jia Li needs to know. This is all thanks to her. See you. - Where are you going? - My hero, Jia Li. - I'm going ahead. - It's close by. - Can I go to your place some time? - Okay. Widya, are we going lunch today? Yes. Okay. Let me get my car key, then. - Okay. - I need to tidy up too. That is from Room 550, Madame. - Yes. Her name is Jia Li, right? - Yes. Widya, let's go? Can I have a look after lunch? Please keep it for me. Looks like it will be tighter. Imam. - Hi. - Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam. Right. I heard your thesis is entering chapters four and five now? Congratulations. You must have heard from Billy. Isn't it okay to share good news? Imam, sorry. Widya and I will go pray together and have lunch. Alright. Please. Thank you. You're welcome. Give her up already, Imam. She's far now. Billy. No matter how far, if you're meant to be, you'll meet in the end. Sounds good. How about the money? Money can be obtained. Let's go. They're waiting. You should have invited Widya along. Come on, let's eat. - Alright. - Come on, Imam. - Good evening. - Yes. Stella, you sit here. So that you can get along better with Billy. Yes. Oh my, you just graduated but a bride is already awaiting you. And family business as well. That's perfect. I'm really prouf of you, Billy. I can relax now... ... because your mother and I can have our wishes come true... ... of having a grandchild, of course. Wedding comes first, Dad. Aside from a bride we have prepared for you,... ... I also have another present for you. What is it, Dad? Your will? You can enjoy this. Stella, please give him this present. China! I want to go with you! Of course, but after you're married. Is this true, Mom? Thank you, Dad. China! I'm really lucky to be born into this family. - Billy, can I ask you something? - What? Is everything included in this? - Are you sure? - Yes. Yes! Alhamdulillah! What? - What? - What is it? - Are you going to ruin my vacation? - No. - No way. - Chill. - What? - Your vacation is also mine. We're buddies. We're always together. What? It's my graduation present. What about yours? Mine will be sailing along after some vacation. - What nonsense is that? - Listen to me. Have you heard of an old Islamic saying,... ... "Pursue knowledge as far as China." Right? Me too. I'll pursue my love as far as China. Cool, right? Okay, Honey? - Shut up! - Come on. What should I do for you? - Come on, Honey. - Hey. - What? - Pay your own fare. Pay your own fare. Pay your own food. Do your business by yourself. Don't be a burden to me. Come here, that's okay. Okay, Billy? Thank you, Billy. What did you say? I said, if you want to go to China, I won't allow you. Finish school first! What are you doing in China, anyway? Simply going to China. - When will I have an opportunity... - Honey. - Are you opposing your parents? - Calm down... - China... - Breathe. - There's no need to shout. - Hey! Listen! I gave you a good name. I paid your school. What are you wearing there? Like a girl. - This isn't real, Dad. - That's not a piercing. - It doesn't even suit you. - Let's settle this way. Let me ask that house for rent you have. No. Finish school first. Don't be cheeky. There's no need to shout. Mom, help me. There's nothing wrong with Imam going to China, Honey. He must be stressed with school. Isn't he our only boy? - There's money, right? - Yes. - Is it enough? Or more than enough? - I have enough. - Will Imam get some? - Yes. You're sweating, Honey. Let me blow you. Here, there's a mosque. That means we're close. Hurry! Are you sure? I'm sure. Hurry, come here! - Come on, Billy. Show some spirit. - Will you wait? I want to see Jia Li. Is this it? - I think so. - Let's go in, then. No, wait. The last character is different. Then it's not it. - Is that it? - Yes. - Is it? - Yes, this is the one. - Are you sure? - Yes. Hi. Show some manners. Shake hands. - Shake his hands. - Hi, I'm Dao Ming Si. I'm Hua Ze Lei. - What? - I don't know. Can you speak English? Just ask about Jia Li. Jia Li? Yes, Jia Li. Come in. That was Jia Li's surname. Chen Jia Li Tepang Yoma. Jia Li. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Imam? Hi, Jia Li. Indonesia. Okay. I'm happy that you came today. We're holding an engagement ceremony today,... ... between Chen Jia Li and Ma Fu Hsien. Assalamu'alaikum. How are you? - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. What have I done wrong? Why is Allah never kind to me? - Why am I always like this? - Imam. You're still thinking negatively. It is natural that I think negatively about Allah. I came all the way from Indonesia to ask for you hand. To marry you. It's unfair. Imam... I get here and you're already engaged to another man. - Allah is not fair. - Astagfirullah. Forget not. I accept your good intention... ... to have a serious relationship with Widya. Why don't you answer, Sweetheart? I'm sorry, Mom. Dad. I can't accept Dimas' proposal. Sweetheart? Fu Hsien is a good man... I have no reason to say no... ... to him becoming my husband. I am the wrong one. I fell in love too quickly. Imam... ... this is all for the best. - For the best? - Yes. For the best? Bullshit! Astagfirullah aladzim, Imam... I'm sorry... I apologise if your coming here disappointed you. This is all Allah's will. Please don't forget, Imam. Assalamu'alaikum. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Jia Li, where is that friend of yours from Indonesia? Where is he staying? Guests have to be highly regarded, don't disappoint them. Yes, Grandpa, Grandma. Insya Allah, I'll bring them here. Let's go. What? I had it memorized. Memorize what? Jia Li... I love you. That will never work, especially if you don't do it right. Man, I came here to look around, to have fun,... ... to shop for souvenirs, all that. If you want to stay down, go back to Semarang. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Jia Li. - What is it? Imam? I need to meet Ma Fu Hsien. I must. They're engaged, man. What do you want to meet him for? That's fine, they are not married yet, anyway. I need to struggle for this love. I have to talk to him face to face. I have to tell him that I love Jia Li. But the problem is,... ... how can I meet Ma Fu Hsien? I've got an Idea. But let me finish this first. It's delicious. Wait! Give it to him already. I don't want to waste time. - It's a lot. - Thank you. - Go. - You first. Why me? You're the one who... Go in already. I'm scared too. You go in. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. Wa'alaikumsalam. He's Indonesian. Please come in. - He asked you in. - You first. I'm sure you're not here to learn Wing Chun. Or to learn about Islam. I love Jia Li. You're not surprised. You're not angry with me. - Why? - Why should I be angry? You're just following the will of Allah. Okay. Are you gonna leave Jia Li,... ... or are you gonna fight for her? I'm not keeping her with me, or letting her go. Let Jia Li decide what's best for her. Please, drink. Amen. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. - Jia Li? - Yes? Yes. - Assalamu'alaikum. - Wa'alaikumsalam. This is The Forbidden City. We can also call it the old castle... ... or museum castle. But old people say this place... As you can see, this place can hold 100.000 persons. - Billy, I got for a cheaper price. - I don't care. Imam, wait. Wait for Billy. - Come on, Billy. - Let's take pictures here. - Not here. We aren't there yet. - Where? There. Come on, Billy, you can! Come on! Did she say "Cahyo"? That's my friend's name. So, what do you think, Imam? What do you think about Beijing? Do you like it? It's fun, Jia Li. I went to Ma Fu Hsien's school yesterday. Did you meet Ma Fu Hsien? I told him... ... that I loved you. But he said to me,... ... "Imam, I'll never let Jia Li go or keep her with me,... ... because it's her life... ... and only she can choose." So, who are you choosing, Jia Li? Hey. Let's take a picture there. It's nice. Let's take a group picture. Let's go down. Okay, come on. Imam, hurry now. Thank you for bringing me home. I hope you had a good time here. I really had fun! I'm the one who's thankful. - Why? - Because I'm very happy today. I was able to go out with you. You're welcome. Assalamu'alaikum. Wa'alaikumsalam warahmatullahi wabarakatuh. Imam? Widya? What are you doing here? I had to come. For you. - For our sake. - For our sake? We're no longer together, There's no more "us". Imam... I love you. Don't you see who I'm making changes for? I did all this for you. I want to return to how it used to be. Widya... You'd better go back. I can give you no more hope. I have a new hope here. Widya? Astaghfirullah, Widya. Don't! I made all these changes for him. You're just making your intentions the wrong way. Do it all for Allah. Not for this world. Because this life is only temporary. But facing Allah is eternal. Excuse me. Stay here tonight. It's safer here. Did she think she'd be able to melt me? Only because she changed, to be like Jia Li? No way! That's your problem with Widya. I don't care. You don't care? What, where are all those comments of yours? You never listened anyway. I know. So, you think, just because you came all the way here,... ... Jia Li will melt? Look at yourself! Did you see her fiance? Jia Li is a good Moslem. She appreciates men. She respects men. Most importantly, she knows... ... what kind of man is best suited to be her spouse. Do you think I can't pray properly? That's where you're different from Fu Hsien. He does it from the heart, not for Jia Li or anyone. You and Widya are the same, you are both hypocrites! Wait. Billy, why don't we go to Xi'an? - Xi'an? - Yes, my hometown. Alright... Xi'an's Great Mosque. Let me take a picture. - Let me help. - Jia Li. - This one's for you, Widya. - Thank you. Imam, do you want a drink? Drink this. Here, have this. Don't be angry. I choose Ma Fu Hsien as my lifetime partner... ... in the future. I'm sorry. I want to be your friend, Imam. Widya... Imam. Imam. Why are you following me? Don't you understand? Do you think covering up would melt me? No way! You're such a hypocrite! You'd better go home. I'm not the one for you. Do you remember... - Do you remember... - Don't talk about the past! Listen to me! I want to talk. Do you remember how you once asked me to cover up? Just so you know, I no longer work in that hotel. Also, this... At first, I wore this because I love you. I want to be the best for you. After meeting Jia Li, she made me realise everything. Everything... Your parents gave you the name Imam,... ... because there's prayer in it. So that you can become leader.
