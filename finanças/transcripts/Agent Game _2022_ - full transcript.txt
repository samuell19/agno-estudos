We have a problem. How the hell did he find these guys? You know, Manson booked himself a date. You see that girl? Yeah, they're supposed to blend in. Come on, blend in? They're op names are Bundy and Manson. What is it, your first car ride? Please, I worked for Uber for six months before this. Almost got me there. Where are we at with Reese? Reese, you set? Got a 20 on the target. Southwest window. Calm as toilet water. No idea the shit storm about to come down on them. All right. Reese... give Manson and Bundy the goods, then circle back to your second position. Keep it clear back there. Camera check? Camera's on. Copy. Why would you go hide in a shithole? Because no one cares about a cockroach in a dumpster. Ah. Bonne chance. That guy's weird. All right, remember those weapons are for show. We have no legal backing here, so no shots fired. Grab the guy and get him out. Quiet, safe and fast. Copy? Motherfucker. Shots fired. - What was that? - We had an explosion. Bundy, Manson, status? Bundy, Manson, what's you status? Manson, report. We're blind here. Manson, report! Stand down and get the hell out of there. He tossed his feed. We just saw it. All right, meet me at the extraction point. Yeah. Shit! You and your traps. I know you got no friends anymore. But, man, it was easy to find you. We had to come. You knew that. Rookies outside weren't supposed to be around for the kill. She's going to be pissed about that. Second explosion! They didn't deserve to die. You do. I think that welcoming committee's us. We're not done here yet, man. Come on. Forty-five seconds, boys. Hey! Hands behind your back! Hands behind your back! Come on! - No, no, no, no. - Secure him. This is wrong, man. No, this is all wrong. Come on, come on, do it. Miller, we're heading down now. Let's go. Come on. Okay, yeah. Who are you? Omar, my name is Bill. And there's only one path that leads you out of this very, very uncomfortable situation. I dearly hope you'll take it. Where am I? What do you want? I just want you to answer questions honestly, that's it. That's all you have to do. That's all. So let's start with a simple one. Are you a member of the Crescent Democratic Front? Listen, I have asylum in the West. - Yeah. - Me and my wife both do. - Okay? - Yeah. I was on my way to London to meet her - when you kidnapped me. - I understand all that, but you didn't answer my question. Are you a member of the CDF? It's your group, your organization. You run it? - Yes! - Yes. Okay. See, the publicly stated goals of the CDF are to oust the dictator Bandar el-Mizdawi, which is great. I'm all for ousting dictators. Exactly, that... That is what we're trying to do. Good, I like that. Here's where you run into difficulty. So tell me something. Do you know these men? No! Because the CDF claims to be a charity. It's purely altruistic, all right? But we have Intel that shows that you received more than $2 million in donations recently from these... These extremists. That's what they are. They never uttered the word "charity" in their lives. - I don't know these men! - Well, I'll tell you about them. They only associate with terrorists. So you can understand our concern about you and your operation. You understand why I'd want to know why they got involved in the financing. They're not financing my operation. What are you talking about? You making up lies? We are funded by legitimate backers. Mm-hmm. People who want to bring peace. I understand that. That's absolutely true. Up until recently, but now, the bank statements say that things have changed. - No, no, no. - Omar... - That's not true. - I want to believe you, but you got to help me. You got to give me something. What are we supposed to think? The United States and its allies, we... Traditionally, we've granted asylum to individuals who've formed groups that are seemingly in line with our values. But sometimes... sometimes, Omar, those groups... well, they're taking advantage of the privilege that we offer them, and they change their motives. And sometimes they had different motives all along. Sometimes there are terrorists, and they wanted to work against the governments - that were trying to help them. - No, we are not terrorists. You're right. You know what? The word "terrorist," it's a... It's a label. - Maybe you are. - Maybe I am. It's a question of perspective, right? So from my perspective, my government's perspective, you must understand, we have to know... how these dangerous men came to be involved with your group. Why? What did they want? - I don't know these people! - When I walked in the room I said there's only one way out of this for you, and that's to help me. So far, you've given me nothing. I don't know them. How many times am I telling you this? Now you know why we're here. Understand what we have to talk about. - I have an asylum. - So you think about it. - Hey! - All right, Omar. Hey, come on, man. You can't... You cannot do this to me. I'm going to give you a little time to think about it. - Think about what? - To look at the pictures. See if maybe it triggers off some memories. What? I don't know these men! - I'll see you soon. - Hey! I don't know these men! Now what? Now we let him think. We don't have time to let him think. Our orders are to extract Intel that is time-sensitive to our people in the field today. They're my orders. Harris, what you got? Well, I checked him out. All his papers are the real deal. He's both U.S. and U.K. backed. This group comes over here telling us what we want to hear, and then they start working on undermining Western civilization. You could tone down the hyperbole. I'm just saying, like, we can make quick work of this. What are they teaching you nowadays? We're here to get the truth, not force faulty Intel. Bill's been doing this a long time. Yeah, I don't get it. You don't need to get it. We know what we're doing. Why don't you just sit back and learn. May I give it a go? I have an idea. Gentle, direct. A slightly different angle than yours. Now we're talking. - We got to ditch the car. - Negative. - Negative to what part? - Negative all around. Those cops clocked our faces and the vehicle. They may be French, but they can't be that stupid. I knew something was wrong. I knew it! That guy knew we were coming. I'm telling you we have to ditch the car. If the target knew we were coming, he might have friends. The best move is to move faster. Take us straight to the plane. You need to let control know that we're going to be early. You need to just drive. You see this? - Right here, 5:00. - Shit. There's a mark on your 5:00. All right, no communication until we get to the plane. We don't want to risk anything getting intercepted. If he knew we were coming, why did he stick around, then pick a fight, then surrender to us? We have the target, we're on course. One step at a time. Here, sit down. Make yourself comfortable. Is this your office? No, no, this is just where we meet the new recruits. My place, not nearly as cushy as this. Aren't there usually cameras in these meetings? Oh, yeah, but we have plenty of tape on you. Yeah, exactly. Hey, why'd you call me in now? You've denied my application five times in a row. You've... I haven't declined anything. Oh, my God. The Collective Agency, you. Oh, okay, well, I could see why that might be a little confusing for you, um... Your D.O.D. file says you really crashed and burned there, and that's why they've rejected you here. Look I didn't have time to crash and burn, all right? I was sent home immediately. I have no idea why. Yeah, I can see you're upset by that. I can't say it felt good. No, I can imagine I really don't get it. You're smart, ROTC, two tours. Completed your service. Only to wash out after a month at D.O.D. Right. Definitely not ideal. And since then, you've been working in the private sector. Why don't you tell me about that. Uh... it was a couple stints overseas, you know? And, yeah, mainly security. Looking after the fat kid, wondering what's under mama's yashmak. Well... You ever been team leader? Uh, what? What would you say if I told you to apply one more time? Lucky number six. It's okay. Here. Where am I? This is called a Black Site. Nobody knows it's here. Is my wife okay? I'm sorry. I'm just a foot soldier. They don't tell me anything. I'm not even supposed to be in here right now. I was worried about you. I don't have much to offer, but I'm not your enemy. Drink. You have to. Little more. You know the others here, they're not like me. Can you please find out about my wife? What's her name? Fatima. That's a lovely name. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. Well, not how I would have started. Not bad, right? You can't just waltz in through the front gate. I thought it was supposed to be our people on there. Supposed to be. Christ. Holy shit, who hired Nance and Rand to fly the plane? Wait, wait, hit the brights. Go, go! Hands behind your head. - What the...? - Behind your head! - Do it! Don't move! - Turn around! - Hey! - Don't move! All right, pat them down. - Clear. - All right, keep them covered. - Keep an eye out. - Copy. All right. Don't move. All right, we're clear. Let me see. What the hell is this, man? We're just the pilots. We pick you up and drop you off. That's it. Hey, just relax, Pops. It's for the Gramp. Right, turn around. It's all right. It's all right. Aren't there supposed to be more of you? Are we good? They're good. Get us prepped. We need to move fast. I'm grabbing our guy. Hey, wake up, sleepyhead. Let's go. Hey, get up. This way. Step. Hey, Miller, check your line. We're good! What about the wife? He gave me her name. We pick her up, we use her. We've just abducted one possibly innocent man. We're definitely not taking his wife. He's hitting a wall. Bill is not hitting a wall. We kidnap people and transport them to other countries willing to look the other way while we interrogate them. But we do that with the flag on our back. It's a dangerous grey area to do business in, but we have to be careful about drawing a moral line. Orders are the only line. All right, little buddy. Let's get you all strapped in here. That's nice. Now you can't move. Going to get your little feeties. There you go, there. If you need to go potty, just wiggle around. That's good. Now you can relax. Target's secure. All right, get us up and running. - I want updates in flight. - We're good to go. Estimate 11 hours until landing. This is all weird. Yeah, somebody is really aching for this guy. Yep. Call me crazy, but wouldn't this job be a hell of a lot easier if we actually had some information? Well, you know the drill. The more we know, the more we're accountable to. No, I don't know the drill, but the more I learn about it the more I don't like it. Well, you get too much back-story, and suddenly maybe we start deciding for ourselves. The difference between right and wrong. It makes it hard for us just to follow orders. Oh. I never met a pageant winner before. Who have you met? Oh, all kinds of people. Criminals, drug dealers, the odd despot. No... You're not the usual fish, are you? You're like a slice of American pie without the apples. What are you getting at? You go to a top college and you drop out. I don't get it. Mm-hmm. I went back. You went back? Magna cum laude is more than just going back. But then you drop out a second time, right at the end of law school. What gives? I think you already know the answer to that. Did it have something to do with that classmate's ass you kicked and put him in the hospital? You mean my professor? Professor? Ah, that's good. He must have really given you a bad grade. I gave him a black eye. He gave you a black mark. So pretty good. Hmm. I see that's sort of behavior as an advantage for you and me, quite frankly in us. Most people would hardly consider a temper and difficulty forming relationships an advantage. Well, we are big believers in practical application here. I don't know what practical application means. Good, keep it that way. You're a very well-tabernacled spirit. See, if I figure if we put you in the right place and the right circumstances, it could be advantageous to everyone, including your country. Hmm. Tell me more. The clock is ticking on Omar. Well, sir, he insists he's never met the targets, and he's adamant that the CDF exists only to resist el-Mizdawi. If there's no Intel to be gained... move on to the next phase. Well, where's the Intel come from, sir? It's... It's wafer thin. It's a couple of documents. You got to go in and bring home the bacon. I understand, but no... With respect, sir... - Do it. - I... Sounds like we're on the same page. Yeah, copy that, sir. Shut the door. They're pushing us. They're pushing us on this guy. And there's... There's something they're not telling us. Well, it's not the first time. I don't think Omar's met those men. I don't think even if they find us, then the CDF has any idea, do you? Well, what about the wife? Oh, shut the... Visser had surveillance on her? Yeah. Fine. Let's use the wife, let's amp up the dramatics. Hey, Harris... whatever they end up telling us on this, you help me keep my head straight. All right? Never seen you call one wrong. Funny. Hey, you stressed? No, no, no, no, it's pretty standard. Way to pop my cherry. Are you seriously telling me this is your first time? Yeah, man, we're getting to know each other here. Let me get in here. Kavinsky, you're a Marine, right? When I was behind you on that staircase, I thought: That's Kavinsky, he's got to be a Marine. Either that or, I don't know, Polish fitness influencer. Now look at you. - Yeah, what about you. - Huh? You're too dumb to be Air Force, you don't complain enough to be Navy, but you're too pretty to be Army. Maybe he's Coast Guard. Royal Canadian Coast Guard, actually. Just a boot rec. Well, spent some time in Warsaw. Hmm. Agency after? Yeah, I bounced around a little bit. What bounced around? Bounced around where? Typical shitbag stuff. Developed some bad habits in the stan countries. Yeah, I guess we all did. Yeah, but I guess the agency likes some of my bad habits, because here I am. It's good to be back in the game again. How about you? How long you been a company man? Well, come on now. Give me something. Be good to know something about a guy I'm in the shit with. It's a recent development. Really? I'd have pegged you for a salty dog. I always wanted into the agency, but I guess it took a minute or two to line things up and all. I hear that. It's a tough career choice. Oh, hi, Poindexter. Tell us about yourself, babe. How'd you end up here? When it comes to passing and failing a test, I'm a loose cannon. Give me life or death, and I'm surprisingly cool. But overall, I'm bored. She's a dream recruit. Well, look at us, knucklehead, jarhead, baghead, and a surprisingly cool head. We're a ragtag bunch. But this is good. Getting to know each other. I'm feeling safer already. Well, as long as you feel good, that's all that matters, right? You guys hungry? I saw some almonds back there. I'm going to get some almonds. You want some? What do you want? Omar, we've reached a point now where... we're going to have to escalate things. So I'm going to ask you one last time, why are these men involved with CDF? For the hundredth time, they are not! Okay. I'll kill you! These were taken about an hour ago. - What do you want from her? - Omar, she's terrified. She probably thinks you're dead. Just let her go, man. What do you want? To be honest, I don't know when you're going to see her again, - because we got to bring her in. - For what? She haven't done anything. She's the only lead we have apart from you. I told you everything. What do you want from me? Ghuma Nasuf. He was granted asylum in the West, just like you five years ago. He disappears, he reappears five years later spreading anti-American propaganda around mosques. He's radicalizing young kids to kill Jews, kill Christians. Then arrest him. What do you want from my wife? This guy... this guy could have worked for any of the big four. Instead he chooses to run finances for Al-Qaeda and Chechen rebels. And now he's got his fingers in the CDF. Why? These men and I may have a hundred things in common, but we're not the same. My goal is, and always will be, to rid of el-Mizdawi from our country. Just because you're American doesn't mean your colleagues share the same goal as you. I am a patriot. Are you? Shit. All right, look, Omar, I like what you say in public. I admire you. I watch your speeches. We both have. I think you're a brave man. Here's what I think happened. I think they tricked you. I think they lied to you... and I think that once they put that much money into your group, you don't think you can back out. But I'm telling you, you can't trust them. Then why you trust this bullshit? Maybe you are a patriot. Maybe, all you want is to topple a dictator's oppression of your people. But unless you can prove to me that these people are not involved with CDF or that you don't know what they're planning, then you're guilty by association. And so is your wife. It was the right move. He'll buckle. He's telling the truth. What? How do you know? Because I know. Because it's my job to know. Because I've been doing it for 30 years since you were in diapers. Yeah, and we don't do it like that anymore. We got to get him out of here, Harris. - I know, I know. - No, no, no, no. I... Are you actually...? Can you handle this? - Get her out. - Visser, give us the room please. What are we doing? What the fuck are we doing? Well, he will recover. Though it's done worse. Yeah. I want you to dig. Keep it all quiet, backdoor info. I want to know why they really want this guy. There's a reason info like that's compartmentalized. Once you know it, you're responsible for it. Yeah, well, I'm done. It's not working for me anymore. I know a few guys closer to the field. Spend a lot of time in the gray. They won't bullshit me. Thanks. Shit. - You get any updates? - No. It was just, uh... It's radio silence. Copy you. You guys seen any water around here? Sink in the back. Bill's a true believer. He's served his country well, and he'll continue to serve his country. It's what he signed up to do. Yes, sir. Our mission is to keep the wars small... the sacrifices meaningful... and the story out of the news. We're officially in clean-up mode. Clear? Clear, sir. You know what's required, yes? Yes, sir. You were right. It's a mess. There has been a major shift. We're getting in bed with el-Mizdawi. The guy we've been trying to get rid of for years? - Yeah. - Literally five years in shitholes like this? This is a letter from el-Mizdawi's intelligence chief sent to our station in Qatar. Intercepted by the French, got in the hands of my men on the ground who made friends in the Riviera. They're making a deal with this piece of shit. El-Mizdawi hates Al-Qaeda so much, he's allowing us access to his resources to help hunt him down. Nice guy. Yeah, and as a gesture of good faith, what do you think our new best friend is asking in return? Round up his enemies, people who've been trying to oust him. - Yeah. - We've been protecting, we send them back. And a week after the deal was made, we get orders to pick up Omar. He's a fucking sacrifice. And see if you can find a pillow for me. Power napping. Here you go, sweetheart. - Hey. - Here, keep yourself warm too. Look at this, first class. This ain't no blanket. What? This is a body bag. What the fuck? Kind of blanket you don't take off. It was folded in between the fucking pillows. - What's this doing out here? - How I was supposed to know they were body bags? They were neatly folded. - Thought you checked the plane. - Fuck you! What are you talking about, fuck me? I cleared the fucking plane! - Are you saying fuck me? - Yeah, fuck you! I'm asking you why you gave me... - What the fuck was that? - Oh, that's good. That's fucking great. Hey, guys, just give me five minutes with him. - For what? - He's worried about his wife. He thinks I'm sympathetic. I... I build on that story, it could be something that puts us over the edge. Sure. Uh, we got, what... Uh, clothes? T-shirt? Something, anything. Yeah. I need this guy to think that I'm going to let him walk out of here. I'll see what I can grab. Visser, just so you know, after your little chat, I'm pulling the plug. I'll take whatever Langley throws at me. Knock yourself out. Yes, sir. Why are we descending? - We're going down. - What's happening? Hey! Hey! Good news is we're coming down early. Bad news: it's definitely a trap. Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! Open the fucking door! Goddamn it! - Hey, bad idea. - Fuck! Are you getting any chatter? I got nothing. Badder news, I thought we were going to Thailand. I was going to get a massage and a tom gai soup. Nothing from Control. Shit, what do we do? You look awful. Right now she's got two minutes. Easy, easy. I'm going to lift you up now, okay? I get to sit down... so now I have to be your friend? My colleagues only want one thing. Give it to them, and you get out of here. You're done. Whether you beat me or not, the answer is the same. Okay, I believe you. I wish it didn't have to come to this, but... in that case it's the only way to get you out. To Fatima. Let's get you changed. Okay. Take it. It's the only way to get you out. You don't let anybody stop you. Go, come on. Take it. What is that? Jesus fuck! Stay here! Go. What the fuck did you do? I had to. He attacked me. Sit down. Sit the fuck down! Stay here. Fuck it. Hey, hey, wait, what are you doing? - Getting answers! - No! - Easy, easy. - What the fuck are you doing? Don't you fucking move. Hey, team, good news. I found a half a bottle of tequila. Why don't we have a drink and talk this over without the guns? What the fuck are you doing? You're not authorized to talk to him. I have to. I have to. - No, you don't. - He knew we were coming. He took down two of our guys, and Control's got no answers for us. Now we're stuck in fucking box with no idea where we're headed. You are not allowed to talk to him. Can we break down the walls here? I'm noticing a lot of defensiveness that's coming through somehow. Maybe it's the guns, I don't know what it is. But it's aggressive, and I don't think it's constructive. We need to break through, and get to the bottom of this. There's clearly something wrong here. We're about to land God knows fucking where. For all we know, this guy is controlling the whole goddamn thing. Put it down. How the fuck was there a weapon in that stack of clothes? Ask Harris. Don't try that shit. Those clothes were all I gave you. It's a convenient story. What are you trying to pull? You put my life in danger with your carelessness, and I had to defend myself. Guards. I'm detaining you. Lock her up. She doesn't get to talk to anybody, see anybody. She doesn't get released for any reason. Looks like we're not the good guys anymore. You don't think I put that gun in there, right? Don't be a fucking idiot. Come on, Bill. I think she just sees herself as a patriot. Took matters into her own hands. It's not that simple. What do you mean? This guy Omar, he was always going to leave here in a body bag. What does that have to do with her taking matters into her own hands? She's not going to do this by herself. There's some bigger picture we're not seeing. We got to think smart, buddy, or we're going to get run over here. What next? We get ready. Hey, Miller, I don't think he's the enemy here. You sure? Because somebody's been fucking with this op. Yeah, well, it could just as easily be you, could be me. Can we talk about it without shooting each other? Kavinsky has been getting unsecured messages. Really? Yeah. That's right. I saw them. I asked him, he denied it. And they're not from Control. - Is it true? - She's right. Well, that's interesting. I thought I saw you looking at your phone, you sneaky fuck. Who sent them? - I don't know. - Bullshit! I don't know. I don't fucking know. Control's been sending me messages too. They've detected incoming messages on your line. They said under no circumstances am I allowed to let you talk to the target. So now you're the one following orders? That's the whole point, isn't it? Follow orders. Keep it simple. You're the one who told me that, right? That is what you said. All right, all right. I did receive messages. I don't know who from. I told Control about it, they told me not to open them. Why didn't you tell us sooner? The same reason you're pointing a gun at me right now. All I know is Control and orders, and right now those two are fucked. When did the messages start? When we grabbed him. Everything says we're walking straight into a shit storm right now. Control cut us off. We have to fucking question him. Fine. You sit your ass back down, we let this bird land and we see what happens. Yeah, and we walk straight into an ambush with our pants around our ankles? No. No. We open up that message, rip his hood off and see what's what. Or you guys could just shoot each other. No. No, we open the message. You got it done in there. Ain't perfect, but it's done. Just clean enough to tell the story the bosses want to tell. All right, so we stick to the plan no matter how messy this gets. You sure you don't want us to do this? I'm sure. Okay. Let's move. Okay, wait one second. Let's talk about this, okay? You don't want to do it. Whoever's pulling your strings, you're as expendable to them as I am. No one is pulling my strings. Look, you shot a detainee. I get it. You're scared. I'm scared. But if you help me bring in whoever's running this show, we can get through this together. I promise you that goes away. You shoot a fellow officer... there's no getting back from that. All right. Very slowly, I'm just going to... - Hey. - Hey. Come in, please. It's nice in here. It's like a... It's like an episode of Homeland. You're free to take a load off, if you want. I'm all right. You're not too comfortable indoors, are you? Well... You like it out there. Get your hands dirty, you know? No restraints. - Yeah. - I was looking in your file, seems you went a little rogue for a while there in Afghanistan. Well, you know, it's hard to say no to that many goats. I didn't see that coming. Just like the goat, huh? I figured I brought in the right guy. - Yeah. - No restraints. Want a gig? Uh, you know what? I'm ready for you. I've been frying chicken for Colonel Sanders for the last two years. Even if they rip your nails out, right? You'd never divulge the secret 11 herbs and spices. Can't talk about that. There's somebody you need to meet. It's not Debbie from the Beirut desk, is it? Caroline, could you come in, please? Toss him the line. All right, all right. I'm putting it down. I know that shooter. Me too. Caroline Visser. Reese. Hey. Reese. Like the peanut butter cup. Nice to meet you. She'll be running point on this op. That's great. I'm real excited. Yeah. This is going to be fun. She recruited all three of us, all for this op. Yeah, and I guess she wasn't looking for the A-team either. No offense. So why? Why us? Yeah, why us? All right, I received an unsecured message on my secure line, right? Showing our common thread, Visser killing someone in her own team. This guy's the source of the messages. And I think I know how he's transmitting them. Jesus. We need to free his arms. That's the usual spot. Look, it's easier if I show you. Will you just trust me? All right. Come on. Struck out. Shit. It's the other one. - He'll live. - Okay. You take the main exit, I'll take the back. That's not going to open. Put it on the ground. This was all a sham. We play a complicated game. Allegiances change. You and Bill weren't playing along. What happens to me? I don't have to shoot you right here. You play along, maybe they don't burn you. Maybe you ought to stick to being a guard. Yeah, they're not letting you go. I'm surprised you picked the obvious exit. I'm surprised you fell for it. What? I'll go after him. Let him go. He's burned. What was he doing in the surveillance room? Shit. - What the hell? - That's it. - What? - Data hold. A thin drive encased by plastic. The Russians have been using a lot lately, even though it causes nasty infections. You know Russia. Oh, God. Get some penicillin, buddy. You can program it using a frequency in a specific range, and then set it to broadcast on repeat. All right, why was I the only one receiving the message? Because it picked up your device first, so it must have locked on. And that's why he let us catch him. He wanted us to see that video of Visser. Shit, I can't even pair my Bluetooth with my headphones. All right, okay, look, let's find out why. Cover him. Okay, you have two guns on you right now. You do anything mildly confusing, anything makes me feel uncomfortable, you will be shot dead, do you understand that? Do it. All right. We're descending. Assuming that's not part of the plan. We've been in the air for almost two hours, heading in the direction of Thailand. I knew it, I knew it. Yeah, it's always Thailand. Get away with anything in Thailand. That puts us over Eastern Europe. We're going to Kosovo. And why? Decommissioned black site. No oversight. No eyes. That's where Visser will be. - Shit. - She needs me dead. Actually, she needs all three of you dead. You're welcome for taking out Manson and Bundy, by the way. They were going to kill you in midair. I... Who are you, all right? And why are you carrying that video around in your arm? I'm just a loose end she needs to cut off. She murdered my friend. So I let her find me, took out Manson and Bundy before they could kill you. I can get your eyes on that video, then maybe you're down to help me out, so I have a team. Now here we are. Then we kill her. Aren't you glad we opened that message? You signed our death warrant. You were dead the minute you agreed to this. You're all military gypsies. There's no paperwork on you. Fuck! Her team brought you in, trained you. No, it wasn't her team. No. It was a guy. Either way, they will bury you without a trace. You're assets, not officers. And probably with back stories that make it easy to discredit you if need be. Coming in hot. Hey, what do we do? Buckle up. The facts that matter are, we kill her or she kills us. It's that simple. Is she going to be on the ground when we land? Without a doubt. All right. We need to make it look like we never figured it out. Good night. All right, guys. I don't know where the bullets are going to be coming in from, but I'm with you. That's all I got. Reese. Here we go. What's this? All right, let's gear up. Let's play this out. Reese, take your six. Hey, guys, you know "Kosovo" means "field of black birds" in Serbian? That's kind of cool, right? Just like Game of Thrones. Shut the fuck up, Reese. You sure you can sort this all out on your own? Yes, I'm certain they haven't even caught on. I should have this thing wrapped up in a few. If you don't deal with them quickly, you're going to find yourself with a very unpleasant liability on your hands. I have a backup team inbound to assist. No one knows how many hundreds or even thousands of boys' lives won't have to be lost in the desert because of your work. Considering this is the only thanks you'll probably ever get, I just wanted to make it personally. Thank you, sir. Thank you. Hey, Kavinsky, no matter what happens don't let Visser get a hold of your line. I copy you. This place is huge. Where's the welcome wagon? Now quiet. Eyes open. Easy. Easy guys. You're in the clear. We'll wait for visual confirmation. We're secured. You can holster your weapons. - Hold. - Okay. We'll come to you. Okay. This whole job's been a little hairy. Hairier than your mom's nipples. But you guys handled it. Nicely done. - Is it just you? - You know how it is. The fewer people, the better. Ex-fil team's on it's way to take him. Yeah, where are we? Just sit tight. They'll be here any second. Why'd you go radio silent on us? I couldn't risk communicating with you if your line was compromised, you know that. Speaking of your line, let's take care of that right now. - Who is he? - No clue. They keep us in the dark too. So, yeah, like I said, give me your line so my team can run a diagnostic on it. - Want this line? Yeah? - Yeah, that one. I can take care of it right now, no problem. Wait, stop! I mean, if it's compromised like you're saying, I should get rid of it right now. - I should destroy it, right? - Yeah, sure. - That's what I should do. - Go for it. So now does it matter to you? I mean, the dick pics probably already uploaded to the cloud, so, you know, damage done. What about those body bags on the plane? You are go for Operation Clean Sweep. No dust bunnies. Copy. Green light on Operation Clean Sweep. We need the floor completely clean. Roger that, sir. Good. Everyone on the ground is considered hostile. No exceptions. How about those body bags? You saw the video. You want to know who this guy is? This is a guy who turned his back on his duty. And now he is facing the consequences. Do not be like him! - Do your duty! - Move, move! I see this is going well. Inbound heavy. Past the target, 40 seconds. Thirty seconds. Damn it! Ah, shit. Hey, you okay? Yeah, it's nothing. Whoever's coming in that bird, I don't think they're here to help us. Touchdown, ten seconds. Move! Go, go, go! Move it, move it! Move! Move it, move it! It's time for Plan B. - Wait, what was Plan A? - Kill Visser. It was? But I don't think we even talked about that. So, what's Plan B? Kill them all. Okay, I get with that plan. Hockey puck! Oh, shit! Move it, move it! Move, move, move now! You, me, you, me, you, me. Okay, yeah! All right, move. Now! Got one. - Oh! - Reese! Son of a bitch. It's all right. It's okay. It's okay, man. You'll be all right. Okay, yeah. No. Get to Miller. - I'll cover you. - No, no, no, no. - We need to get you help. - Yeah. We just need to get you out of here. The devil's calling me home. All right. I'm gonna a take a few more sinners with me. Jesus. Shit! Reese! Reese is... Yeah, he's down. How many are there? Seven. Plus Visser. - And us? - Three. Including you. Miller! My first kill. - Good! - Yeah. We can't stay here. Cover my left. - What are you doing? - Flushing them out. Go. Fuck! Approaching the target building. Standing by for extraction. Copy that. Ah! Cover! I'm out! Cover. What's that mean? We're supposed to go to him? Run! You good? I'm good. You got to get out of here. What about Visser? She's the reason we're here. She's my problem. Get lost. Maybe you'll get lucky. She's the only one who knows about you, you can disappear. No, there's another guy who knows about us too. - Let me start with her. - Go. Go, we'll cover you. Come on. Come on. Please check the number or call directory assistance. Fuck. Fuck. Did you think that killing two innocent men makes you a patriot? At least Bill didn't hide! How did you go so astray? Same background as me, same résumé. Lined up for a long career in the service. Fuck you! But here you are killing innocent people. And here I am, forced to kill you. Head back, maintain your position. Ten seconds. We got three operators for XO. Let's get this over with. Shoes off. This is not how I saw this going. Nice. They're expecting five bodies. We're gonna give them a bunch of body parts with five pairs of shoes. Five? Visser was never getting out either. Are you sure this is going to work? Give me one of those thermite grenades, they'll be counting shoes to figure if we're dead. Sending. They're coming through! What's the verdict, soldier? We took seven KIAs, sir. Can confirm unknown number of enemy deceased. In English. There was an explosion. It's impossible to tell how many died. We count several types of shoes in the debris. My assessment is no survivors. Very well, stand by. I'll be back. Come in, sir. I have classified tests to run. Do you have assets with strike capability in Grid 4-5-8? Wait one second, sir. Affirmative. What are the orders? I'm going to remote enter via the command entry system. Please share the screen for my eyes only. Authorization code: 5-November-Juliet-Cobra. Color of the day is orange. Copy. You're all set, sir. Have a nice day. Thank you. Okay, son, we're good to wrap this up. Make sure all the elements have been placed. The bodies are placed, sir. Okay, boys, you get back safe, you hear? We got three operators for extract. Go, go, go, go! Alan, I want to issue a press release. Hey, Olsen. Mr. Deputy Director. You look hungry. How about some lunch? You know, I got a hankering for some barbecue. - Let's do it. - Let's do it. U.S. officials are attributing the attack to an organization called the Crescent Democratic Front, a resistance group formed in opposition to the regime of Bandar el-Mizdawi. U.S. intelligence sources say that CDF has recently aligned itself with Al-Qaeda, calling the West occupiers... Thank you. Would you like a fry? Alrighty, then. Thank you. Well... Tell me how it is. Here's to cardiac arrest. Tastes good. The bombing was carried out by political refugee, Omar Abadi. We are told that at least eight U.S. military contractors were killed, which also claimed the lives of several intelligence officers. Did it work? Oh, it worked. What's he doing? Drive! Yeah, what is it? We have a problem.
