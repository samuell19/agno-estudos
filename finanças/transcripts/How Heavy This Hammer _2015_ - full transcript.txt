Open the door, now, unlock the car, open it. Finally, what's the matter with you. Think it's funny? Go apologize to your mom now. - [Woman] What the hell? - Yeah. Just keep him away from me, please. Don't worry. Andrew, where are you? (opera music) [Woman] Irwin? You can start without me. [Woman] What? You can start without me. [Woman] Well, the soup is getting cold and I'd like you to come in here. Please have dinner with me and your sons. I'll be there in five. [Woman] No, you need to come now. Stop playing that game.

[Woman] Oh yeah? Dad, wake up, we're late for school. Here, go get your stuff please. Irwin, get up, morning. Here, coffee. Thanks. Did you get any sleep last night? Well, probably sleeping on the couch is not the best idea for your back. Maybe you should go upstairs, have a hot shower, make yourself feel better. Okay. Hi Gort, good morning, this is Irwin. I just got your post here in the office. Yeah, we have to set a date and time to get it to you because you have to sign a delivery receipt or you can pick it up here, I'm in my office the whole day. Just let me know, okay, have a nice day, Irwin, bye bye. [Computer] Vikings, enemy spotted. Come on, on the bed, come on, come on, man. Alfie, come on, come on Alfie, come here, yeah. (dog whimpers) - Hey Andrew. - [Andrew] Hey. Where's your backpack? Right there. Come on, man, stop kicking your ball. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, I just have to get his backpack. What's in here? Your shoes are there, where are your boots? Your mom told me they were here. [Andrew] I didn't bring them, dad. No, but your mom told me they were here. So, where are they, where's your cubby? Check your cubby. Sorry, excuse me. Not in here, not in here. Come on, check there. Do you know where his boots are? - I don't know. - [Irwin] No? Do you know where he could find his boots. In the lost and found. Lost and found, okay. I'm sorry, I'm trying to find his boots, but they're not in his cubby. Okay, I'll come help you in just one moment. Okay, so we should check a cubby again? [Woman] Yeah, that'd be great. No, they're not there. Okay, back to the teacher. Sorry Miss, can't find his boots. Okay. [Irwin] Could you give me a hand please? Yeah, yeah of course, no problem. So you can't find your boots, Andrew? [Andrew] No. What do they look like? [Irwin] That's the third time we come here, so they're not there. Okay. Is there any place they can be if they're not in there? [Teacher] Where, you wore them today? - [Andrew] Yesterday. - Yesterday? Yeah, I forgot them. Okay, well why don't we check the lost and found. Yeah well, I don't want to deal with this. Let his mom deal with this okay, I don't have time for this. Okay, alright, I'm sorry. [Irwin] One medium popcorn, please. What are you going to get? - [Boy] M&Ms. - [Boy] Wine gums. Yeah? [Boy] M&Ms. [Woman] I think we should get one. Let them have one each. Okay, one M&M and one wine gums please. [Cashier] Wine gums, there you go. It's going to be 13.50 altogether. There you go. [Cashier] Thank you very much. (upbeat music) (snores) Irwin, he falls asleep. Hey guys, what's up? I'm getting pinched on the side. Look at, I'm getting beat up, man. The ref can't see, he's on the other side. Maybe we should go talk to the ref? No, no, no, no, no, don't go talk to the ref. I'll sort it out, okay, I'll teach him a lesson. Barry, you're going to take my position, okay? [Man] Crouch, bind, set! [Man] Ready, ready, ready, ready? (men shout) (whistle blows) [Man] Come on, boys. Somebody is going to get hurt here. What the fuck was that? Guys, can you put the bags down and go get the stuff in the car, please? I found Andrew's boots. [Irwin] Oh yeah, where were they? In lost and found. This woman was so difficult to deal with. She didn't even want to go check lost and found. - [Woman] Cindy? - Yeah. Well, I think she was a little concerned that you got so upset. I wasn't upset. Anyway, I don't want to talk about it, it's ridiculous. [Woman] Okay. Mess him up, mess him up, mess him up. Get out, yes! Give it. Okay guys, come on. (dogs bark) Go on. Come on, Alfie, come on here. There you go, there you go, boy. [Woman] Lie down on the ground again. [Irwin] There you go. [Woman] Okay, relax. Good run, yeah. Good boy. You know I was thinking, one of the ladies was mentioning about getting a electric collar for the dog. That's supposed to help control him and his banging into other dogs and stopping and all that kind of stuff, but I think it's kind of mean doing that to the dog, but if it doesn't really hurt them, it might help. Yeah, you should try it. [Woman] You glad you came. [Irwin] Yeah, yeah, I'm just a little tired. Yeah, maybe you should go to the doctor. [Irwin] Oh, come on, there's nothing wrong with me. [Woman] Sometimes when I come home, you're asleep on the couch, other times, you're asleep in front of the television. I'm okay, I'm okay, I don't want to talk about it anymore, okay? [Woman] I don't know, I'm just concerned. Come on, boy, come on, boy, hey. [Woman] Like, if you're... Can we stop it, please? How many races are still left today? Like three maybe, it's probably like an hour. Why, you bored? [Irwin] No, no, no, no, not at all, just want to know. [Woman] Well, if there's anything you want to talk to me about or tell me or if I upset you in anyway, you just have to let me know. Kate, we're fine, I'm fine, all is fine. [Kate] Okay. I think I will get that collar though. Yeah, it's a good idea, I should do that. Hey guys, come on, hurry up, let's battle! Ready for destruction? Ready for war, bring down your laptop and let's battle. Come on, guys. Bring down you laptop now, come on. - You bring your laptop? - Yeah. Okay, let's make some space. Put the laptop here. Now, we got to turn this your way and I'm going to turn this my way and the one who wins chooses the movie this evening, okay? [Boy] But you always lose. - [Boy] I know. - Not this time. Not this time. Are you letting me win? [Boys] No. How do you know how to do that? I think I was a viking in a previous life. It's just natural. [Boy] It's not natural. Thanks guys, I love you too. Yeah, tonight is my night, I'll choose a movie tonight. I won, I won, yeah. (snores) [Boy] Really? [Kate] Irwin, please get up. [Andrew] Send him upstairs. [Kate] I'm trying, baby.

What's the matter with you, man? Irwin, just go upstairs. You look really uncomfortable. I think you should just go to bed, okay? Why can't you leave me alone, man? I'm just taking a nap. Why don't you watch your movie? [Andrew] Why don't you watch it with us? I'm trying to watch it with you. What's the matter with you, man? Come on, you don't do that. This is fucking ridiculous, you know this? Irwin. [Irwin] Fucking ridiculous. Irwin, stop talking to him like that! We were just trying to help you. [Irwin] I don't have to take this okay? Fucking ridiculous. I'll be fine. [Narrator] The spears are ready. [Andrew] Dad. [Narrator] The spears are ready. [Andrew] I didn't mean to hurt you. I just wanted to wake you up, so we can watch the new movie. Dad. [Narrator] The spears are ready. [Andrew] Dad, are you going to... Just go. [Narrator] The spears are ready. What's the matter with you? Why'd you get so upset? Irwin, we were just trying to watch a movie. Why is it okay for you to talk to me like this? I'm not talking to you like anything. I don't know what's the matter with you. You're just walking around here like a zombie, you're swearing at the kids. I'm an old man, I get tired, so I can have a nap. [Kate] Well Irwin, I get tired too, okay? There was no reason for you to act like that or swear at Andrew. [Irwin] Leave me in peace, okay? (opera music) [Man] If you just need a place to crash, Irwin, just crash on my couch. No, no, no, I don't want to be a burden for anyone. Just need a place of my own. I don't know how long I'll be here. Maybe a few nights, maybe a little bit longer. But by the time I leave, I guarantee you you can rent it out again.

Nothing, we had a nice lunch and had fun, but oh my God. I don't get it. [Liz] You don't get what? Common sense that we shouldn't be driving after drinking so much. What, you thought it was about getting laid? Well, we had a connection for sure and you said, yes, you want to come to a hotel, so what did you expect? Yeah, you know what I am leaving.

[Boy] We're making spaghetti. How was your job? [Kate] Oh, it was okay, very long, tiring, sorry I'm late. That's okay, no problem. Yeah, so we started to cook because they were hungry and I said, well, what do you want to cook and they told me spaghetti and then yeah, I hope you don't mind, but I went through your fridge and got some vegetables. I do not mind, when people want to make dinner. Have you taken the dogs out? No, no, not yet. Ben, Alfie, come on. Go on, Ben, come on. [Boy] Mom, how long does it usually take? It said seven to nine minutes, right? [Irwin] It doesn't take too long, the onions and the vegetables doesn't take too long. Okay Kate, food is on the fire, water's almost boiling, so think you can handle it from here and I'm going to go home. Why don't you stay for dinner? [Boy] Yeah. [Irwin] Are you sure about that? - [Boy] Yeah stay. - Yeah. I don't see why there should be a problem with staying for dinner. - [Boy] Dad stay. - [Irwin] Okay, thank you. [Boy] Yay. Yeah, I like cheese with spaghetti. [Kate] Did you guys have a good day with your dad? - [Boys] Yeah. - [Kate] Good. [Irwin] So how come you're eating here now? Not in the kitchen anymore. [Kate] I don't know we've just been sort of eating in here, kind of regularly, something different. [Irwin] Andrew had something interesting in school today. Something about persuasive writing. [Seth] That was me. [Irwin] Yeah, oh that's Seth, sorry. [Kate] What was that? We had to write about something that we wanted. [Kate] What did you write about? Getting a donkey. - [Kate] You want a donkey. - Yeah. [Kate] You guys like cooking? - [Andrew] Yeah. - Well, that's good. Cuz I'll let you do it a lot more. [Boy] Yes. Okay guys, you remember the song? - [Seth] That song? - [Irwin] Yeah. - [Andrew] What song? - [Seth] Oh no. You know that line? (speaks in foreign language) [Irwin] You know what means? I thought I could do without you. [Seth] I thought I could do it without you. [Irwin] Yeah. [Seth] How about the second part? [Irwin] (speaks in foreign language) means a new beginning. [Andrew] We can sing it. [Irwin] You guys have to go to bed, okay? Eat up, y'all. [Boy] Y'all. Can you put your plates in the sink, please? Okay. [Kate] And go up stairs and brush your teeth. - Okay. - [Kate] Thank you for dinner. [Boy] Dad, can you tuck is in to bed? Don't forget to brush your teeth. [Boy] Yeah. [Irwin] Well, I really should be going. - No, no, no, no, no. - Please? - Please? - [Seth] Please? If you promise to brush your teeth right now, I'll put you to bed, okay? Thank you. [Irwin] If that's okay with you. [Kate] Yes, of course it is. I think it was nice to sit down and have a good meal together, thank you. - [Irwin] How's it going? - [Seth] Good. Brushing your teeth well? Upside and down, yeah. I want to show you something. [Irwin] Why don't you finish brushing your teeth first? I can do both. You should not do that in your room. - [Seth] Why? - Okay, show me, show me. - Come on. - [Seth] It's over here. You know that game you couldn't beat? I figured out how to beat it. [Irwin] Give your toothbrush to Andrew now, come on. [Seth] Okay. Go to the bathroom. Just have to go follow those guys and you'll win. See? - Let me sit down. - [Seth] Okay. Go that way this time, so they won't follow you. What's that over there? Over there, those guys are trying to find you. [Irwin] Wow, and what's that over there? Oh, there's nothing over there. There are people that are going to come out of this. See they're coming out now. You need to make sure that they don't see you. [Kate] How are you guys doing? We're on the computer. [Kate] Well, it's bedtime. [Seth] But dad said it was okay. Well, mom says, it's time for bed and Andrew, would you please brush your teeth in the washroom, honey? - [Andrew] Okay. - Thank you. Come on, buddy, come on. [Seth] Okay. - [Kate] Got your teddy? - Yeah. Okay. I'm tired too. Go over there, see. - [Kate] Andrew. - Yeah. [Kate] Come on, buddy, it's time to go to bed. Are you going to sleep in your bed? Just for one minute. Okay. [Kate] What time is it? Irwin, what are you doing here? Help me put Andrew to bed. Want me to give you a hand with the plates? No, it's okay, thanks. [Irwin] Are you sure? Yeah, thanks for making dinner though, I appreciate it. Oh, you're welcome. Are you going to get a taxi? Can I sleep on the couch? Irwin, it's late, I'm very tired, come on. Okay. You're just ridiculous, at this point. Okay, just go home. [Irwin] But this is my home. It's not right now and we'll figure that out at a later date, but I want you to go now. Yeah, I regret all the things I did to you. I really do. I'm going to call you a taxi, I want you to go. [Irwin] I know I drove you crazy, but I'm taking my life in my hands, so I'm changing. - Yeah? - [Irwin] Yeah. How's the doctor going? [Irwin] It's good, it's just a start. - Are you going? - Yeah. She says that I should start communicating with you, as well. You didn't go see a doctor, Irwin, come on, give me a break. Yes I did, yes I did. - There's no way. - [Irwin] How do you know? You did not. Cuz you didn't, I know you didn't, I know you. I don't know what to do with you. I don't know how to help you. I don't know what's going on with you. [Irwin] Here we go again. It's not here we go again. I've put up with so much with you. I've tried to help you so many times and you don't. [Irwin] I don't need this, okay? I don't need it either. [Irwin] We had a good times this evening. I don't need this, this is ridiculous. It is ridiculous. I have to explain to the kids. They ask me all the time, where's dad, what's wrong with dad? You completely ignored the kids, you ignored me. Do you know how that felt for me? [Irwin] Stop talking about the kids, okay? Constantly having to tell the kids. They ask me, what's wrong with dad? [Irwin] The kids are very happy with me. They're very happy when they're with me. Just go Irwin, I've had it. I'm going to bed, I don't want to see you here tomorrow. Kate, wait. Don't come up here, go. [Irwin] I want to talk to you. - [Kate] I don't. - [Irwin] Please. [Kate] Go home. (opera music)
