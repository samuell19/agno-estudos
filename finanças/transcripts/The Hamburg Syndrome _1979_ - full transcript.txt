THE HAMBURG SYNDROME Are we slaves of time irrevocably? Why this resignation, this fatalism when it comes to the inevitability of the end of life? Nobody denies, that death is something natural, but mankind has proven more than once, that it controls nature. [PROLONGING LIFE - POSSIBILITY OR UTOPIA?] I pass over to Professor Ellerwein, the author of the well known book "On the cusp to eternal life". Professor Ellerwein, ... Er, did he arrive already? May I? May I have another look into your bag, please? You know what. I'll pick it up again later. Yes, sir! Hello! My friend Ellerwein! Eternal life awaits us! Professor Blaschek, I'm pleased to meet you here! Professor, you have to hurry. -Yes. Can you tell me, my dear, where I can find a pipe-cleaner? I just can't find one in this dump. Professor, I have to go in. I'll follow shortly, after I finished smoking. Ladies and gentlemen, today, whilst on my way to you, I found this article in a newspaper: At the beginning of the last long vacation in North Rhine-Westphalia, on various autobahn service areas alongside their routing to the south, 46 grandmothers and grandfathers were being abandoned. That are twelve grandma's and grandpa's more than last year. Ladies and gentlemen, we're not talking about dogs or cats, but about our older fellow citizens. The question is not, whether science will be able to stop the process of aging, that's a problem of investment, of time and money, Dr. Spengler, come quickly! the question is, whether a society, which only focuses on production capacity, and which thinks of their older fellow citizens as being dead weight, still wants to dream that dream. If it's true, that the primal presentiment of immortality is embedded in our subconscious, than we have to make it an conscious desire of mankind. Excuse me, Professor Blaschek suffered a seizure... Unfortunately I have to pause. I'm sorry. Where's Professor Blaschek? Who? The one who just collapsed! Ah yes, they carry him away right now. Professor Blaschek! And I was hoping to find here some formulae to eternal youth... What's with you? We have to pay for everything, sometimes even for dishes broken long ago. You will outlive us all! Problem is, I don't even know if I want to... [CONGRESS CENTER HAMBURG] Sebastian Ellerwein, can it be true? Ursula, what a surprise, I didn't know you're here! Yes, it's been ten years. Yes! Marburg, remember? Mhmm. It's been a long time... Quite a bit! Sebastian, you didn't change at all! ...it only seems so! Look Dr., my child! Please, we're waiting for an hour now. Wait a minute, ok? Come! Please Dr.! I have to go to work... I'm in Hamburg to attend a congress so I thought I'll ask after a colleague of mine. Doctor, doctor! Courage, sir, courage, everything will be fine! Oh, yes... Should I start Mr. Ritter's transfusion now? Yes, I'll come in five minutes. "Professor Blaschek", he must've been taken to this hospital today. He suddenly collapsed during my lecture. Erika? Yes, please? Please get me a coffee and some sandwiches. My pleasure, doctor. Brigitte, was a Professor Blaschek taken to us? Ah yes... Yes, okay. Thanks. You knew him well? Yes, why? He's dead. We have strict orders to not put out any statement, to prevent panic amongst the population. During the last eight days several mysterious fatal casualties happened in the city. It could as well be ten or fourteen days, as it took some time, until the cases were linked to each other. They had nothing in common, neither symptoms nor anything else. But the dead are present. We dissect them round the clock. [ISOLATION ZONE] Bring me the next one! Damn, what a mess. With all this blood this looks like a slaughterhouse! Clean it up! Refrigerator! Professor Strasser, this is Dr. Ellerwein. Pleased to meet you! This is Professor Strasser from the Tropical Institute, he arrived this afternoon. He's got a virus theory but seems to be stuck. How many fatal casualties do we have? Three days ago there were twelve, the day before yesterday 57, and today we already lack space. Come along! Come, come, come! If it really is a virus, and we can't get it under control, I look on the dark side, gentlemen! You noticed the posture? They often take up this weird posture. Take a look! I my opinion, those who avert their eyes are dangerous to public safety. Strasser feels confident that the virus has been introduced from outside the country. Not that he'd have a choice. Health police is raiding every ship. Yuck, lukewarm! I'll walk you out, I have to make my rounds. It's a pity I didn't have time, I'd have liked to visit the congress. What happened? Just a faint! Hey sausage seller, do you fry your stinky stuff again? The whole street is smoky! Bah! Nahaaaa! Hihi hihihi! Hah! Mustard splatters! Hu! Can't you plant yourself somewhere else? You're spoiling the appetite of the people! Yeah! Yeah! Get lost, half pint, or I'll stomp you into the ground! Piss off, dwarf! Fuck off you stinker, or I'll come out and stuff you into the trash can. Stinky plague-spot! Disgusting bug! Hello, Claudia! Give me a bread roll with fish. The fish melts on your tongue, and the bread roll is as fresh and firm as you! Ah, don't chat me up! Are you up for a quickie some day? All morning I made out with some wogs, don't bother me with it now, I'd rather do it with him, that way I'd do a good deed. Yes, you reek of french fries! Women sicken at you! Hahaha! Now what? You buyin' or not? Great, isn't it? Oh no, not that way! Hands off! Let go, you stinky wog! Fuck off, motherfuckers! Piss off! Come in, girl, let's drink a beer! I tell you, you won't see me here for much longer! In a few weeks I have something better. I have some connections, so I'll get the concession for sure. I'll open a small specialty restaurant, only six or seven tables, fairly comfortable. Where can I find Sonja? Sonja? What do you want from her? She told me I can work for her. -You're broke, girl, aren't you? Hey, girl, come over here. Yes, come here! Yes! These young girls all move into expensive apartments und when they no longer can afford the rent, -Come, I've to tell you something. they come to us to make big bucks. I've to tell you something personal, yes? Only to you. There are three things, which are mentionable about me: A bright mind, a strong hand and that thing between my legs that I'd like to show you. Come! Sonja? You have a visitor! [Turkish speaking] What happened with him? Maybe he jerked off? I did nothing. Nothing! -Those weirdos! Once they're finished they'll go postal. -Nothing! Then they'd fuck everything with a heartbeat! That swine! Sonja! Sonja!! Sonja!!! Come, let's vamoose. [Woman with megaphone gives instructions in Turkish.] Hey, there's the swine! -[Speaks Turkish.] [Woman with megaphone gives instructions in Turkish.] Halt, stand still! -What? You should stand still! Go back! You touched people, go to the car! People are not ill, only drinking! All are healthy. -[unintelligible] No sick persons here! All people are healthy! [Turkish speaking] Thanks! Cheers! Ah! Now, stick your tongue out everybody. Come over here. Open your mouth. Now open your mouth! Say: "Ah"! [Turkish speaking] Say "Ah"! Aaah. Aaaah! -Ah! -Yes, good. Next one! Aaah! -Good! Say "Ah"! -Aaaaah! Good! Say "Ah"! -Ah! -Good! Eyes! Good! Aaaaaaah!! -Oh! Should it prove true that your ship is a center of an epidemic I'd personally stay on board to share your fate with you. Tonight, 18 Turkish seamen were picked up while hanging out with 18 prostitutes. Assuming that every prostitute had 15 customers over night, well, let's say 10, that's easier to calculate. 2/3 of those customers are married... -Mhmm. ...and have to attend their marital business in the morning. That makes 120 wives. Half of those wives again have lovers. Can one say that half of Hamburg's wives have lovers? I hope so! We forgot the procurers! -Ahahah. 18 'ZU's. -That makes 396 contacts in 24h. Ladies and gentlemen, I'm pleased you could make it on short notice. You all know the state of affairs. I may add what the port health office just informed me of: The investigation showed no signs that the epidemic was introduced on the seaway. Before taking measures, I'd like to hear your opinions. Professor Clemens! Yes, as a doctor my first question is, how's the disease being transmitted? Through the air, through physical contact, through food intake? Apart from humans animals can act as a carrier as well. From flea, lice and flies to rats, parrots and budgies. You all know these cases. So the first thing we have to do is to find the carrier. It could be a synthetic virus out of a laboratory!? Unlikely. But they're doing such researches, under absolute secrecy! Gentlemen, please... Not so long ago, chemical warfare agents disappeared from a Federal Armed Forces repository in M?nster. Maybe we should try to find out the composition of the toxins. It could also be an intoxication of greater extent. Or it could be contaminated flour in a bakery, or the oxide of any tin. One even found viruses in space, so what if a space-capsule returned back to earth and... Where do we have space-capsules in Hamburg? Good afternoon. Please excuse my appearance, but it's a measure of precaution to your own safety. Professor Strasser, I'm pleased you could make it to us. Do you have any results? No results, but maybe you want to hear my opinion? Please. All signs indicate a virulent germ. Over the last years we found many germs. That's why the fact, that we've not yet had a positive finding, doesn't contradict with my thesis. But it doesn't prove your thesis either. Gentlemen, the public is alert, they demand immediate measures to fight the epidemic. Excuse me, but how do you want to fight it as long as you don't know what it is? It's not quite correct to say we can't fight a disease we don't know. I suggest we inject broad-spectrum virostatic agents to Hamburg's population. What you're saying is outrageous. The disease is outrageous, dear colleague. It's convenient to assume a viral disease, but woe betide us if it's not a virus! With this measure we'll lose the chance to find the cause of this phenomenon. But we can't wait weeks or months until you find the cause. I think, only Professor Strasser's suggestion gives us a concrete opportunity to do something. Well, if we've only been called to give our blessing to your decisions, then please excuse me. Ehehehehe. Pardon me. May I use your phone? Unit-fee call? No, out of town. Thanks. Keep away, you old germ spreader! What do you want, you old fart, you! I [unintelligible] kiss my own children on the mouth. You old sod! You could put a condom on your tongue. [unintelligible] Hello? Yes, Sebastian speaking. I have to speak with the Old Man. Yes, yes, I'm still in Hamburg. Did you hear what's going on here? Yes, good. Good, I wait. It's obvious to me that terrorists have poisoned our drinking water. So what, you got booze to brush your teeth. Yes, yes, it puzzles me, the symptoms can't be assigned to any known disease. All this... sounds somewhat weird to me. Hello? Hello? Professor Hammerschmidt, thank goodness, I could reach you. Aha, you're already in the know. No, no, death seems to occur all of a sudden. Till now I wasn't able to observe a dyin... Just a second, hold the line! Someone tumbled down! Hello! Come out! What's with you? Are you in pain? Do you understand me? I've got to call an ambulance. Wait, don't... Call the ambulance! You touched the man, why did you touch the man? Someone call the ambulance! You heard it in the radio, you shouldn't have touched the man! See! Now I touched you too! Police! Stay away! Stay away! Go back over there! I'm a doctor and I wanted to... [unintelligible] Hey, he touched him too! Hey, he touched him! But why...? -Don't touch him! Stay back! -Get on the ambulance! Stay back further! Futher back! Go in there! Go in there! Stay back! Sit down please! Am I sick now? Why couldn't I stay with the dead? Why do you hinder the work of the physicians instead of helping them? Am I really sick? We have to find out more about the past of these people, what situation they were in when they sickened. What they felt because of the disease. I'm not sick. I feel fine. Really. [unintelligible] You shouldn't walk around with bare feet! My father always said that, but at home I had slippers. You see, our exemplary health service didn't even think about something as simple as slippers. Do you write letters? Yes. I'm telling my wife where I am. As it's no longer possible to phone out of town. Our letters are being transmitted through telex. Everytime I want to write a letter I'm clueless about what to write. Besides I wouldn't even know whom I should write. I don't believe you. -Sure, sure, honestly! You surely must have an admirer. Well, hmm. Stay close to me, girl. You'll be amazed. I have a surprise for you. Now I'm curious. Why do you think I'm doing kitchen duty? You just have to stick with me! Really? Come, your friend Heribert always knows what to do. Listen, I'm not sick. And I don't want to get infected. I'm watching out. We have much to exhibit against the administration. [unintelligible] [tumult] Tomorrow they'll fall below 100! Of course the banker said "wait", obviously they don't want to pay out money right now. Move it, you rat! If you wait one more day we can hang it up! That's not important! Sell, right now! Never again I'll help other people! I did what I could! And I'll declare that in the presence of witnesses! This is a work place... I won't help any ships anymore! No ship, no human! What do you think happened? I came here to clean the toilets, and they didn't allow me to leave again. Don't take me at a disadvantage! You can't ask me to agree with that now, Hubert! Knight to E4. -Knight to E4. What's been good for 20 years can't suddenly... No, Hubert, no! -Here, I'll take you out if you want. Let the others go to seed here. We won't grow old here, girl. Well, what do you say? -That hurts me. This evening we vamoose, you and me! That's liberty! What should I do out there? Aaaaah! A dead, a dead! Ahhhhh! Ahhhhhh! Aaaaaaah! Aaaaaaaaah! We have to hold together now, professor! You won't get the disease under control this way! On the contrary! That's nothing of interest to us, give us a room where we can practice! Look at the people, they get... they virtually get prepared for the disease! I don't care, then let the priest preach somewhere else! If one has such a highly talented daughter, then one should give her training. Keep on playing, my dear. 20, 23. Ladies and gentlemen, the sermon starts in two minutes. [turmoil] -We want to go home! What's happening? Get out! Go back! Ulrike! This is our opportunity! Let's get out of here! C'mon professor! Don't daydream! [turmoil] -Therefore I take pleasure in illness, in reproaches, in necessities, in persecutions, in distresses for Christ?s sake. Please keep calm! Think about the charity commandment! -Let us out! Let us out! Hey! Hey! Please, keep calm! We must not endanger our neighbours! Hey, Heribert! I'm here! Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick! Open the hatch, professor, the wheelchair has to go in the back! But I want to sit in front! -For all I care, come on! Ah, my diary! Are you nuts? I want my diary immediately! Oh shut up now and sit down! Can you drive, professor? This car? I hope so! [unintelligible] 'Cause I ripped my whole arm open. We have to get out of Hamburg before they close off everything. I need to go to the hotel, all my luggage's there. Count me out. They'll lock us up right away again. That area sure is packed with cops. Hey, take care! These are all foods. You did a fantastic job. Without you I wouldn't have been able to escape. I've done what I could. Without me... you'd be totally helpless! Hm! There they are already! Damn! But I must drive left! Drive right, dude, we need to keep a low profile. Hamburg is sealed! I told you, but nobody listened to me. Now I'm curious about how you get out of this shit. I doubt they're as smart as myself. Drive to the free port, professor. Crap! That's a dead end too. Don't stop, professor, or we'll be stuck in the traffic jam! Well, what else should I do? Don't drive in there, we'd never be able to get out again. To the right! Drive! Step on it, dude! Accelerate! Go, go! Ulrike? May I touch your hair? Take care of your hand, don't let dirt enter the wound. I'll take a look at it later. What's your profession? Gerontologist. Kind of a physician, huh? Now, with a cripple and a physician we'll surely make it. Give me your health professional papers! Why? I know how to talk to people. Comes with experience. I transport a critically ill and a physician. Who's in charge? In these times everyone's reliant on everyone. Dude, I don't wish you to be in my shoes. Quite a lot going on here, huh? -What's that with your transport? Here, the papers. -Huh? A truly exceptional case. -Really? Hey, hey, stop pushing! I'll see what I can do for you. Wait a moment! Pull over! I'll check your papers. Let's get out of here! I'm coming! Step on it! Are you nuts? What's with my health professional certificate? They're feeding the computer with it. Go, drive, professor! That's just like a rat cage! Slow, Slow! Hey, you! Are you nuts? Stop the car! Stop the car! Ah, let him go, dude! -I can't believe this! He won't get far. So! Heh! Heh! Were you scared? You've got a nerve! -Satisfied, professor? I've never done that before. Aaah! There are worse things, professor. Let me out of here! Lend me a hand, professor! What a stench! What you palm off on people! Not even a dog would eat it! Thankfully those weren't food controls! Go pick some flowers, dwarf! Heribert! Herribeeeeert! Thank you so much, my friend! That's good! Ah, that's good! My wife always thought I'm a coward. I'm amazed of myself. It's true, you've got beautiful hair. It's about time to wash it. Over there's a road! There we can drive on! Ouch,.. Shi... You want to eat something too? The true 'Reinbeisser'! Cold they taste best. Say, professor... What kind of disease is this, that everyone fears? Well, if only I knew... Imagine the following: We take a rat, put it in a way too small cage, feed it unbalanced food, undercool it, the rat survives. Plate? Yes. Now we make the cage even smaller, lower the temperature, poison its food, with metal compounds, lead, mercury, the rat still doesn't die. Mustard? We poison it with bigger doses, lower the temperature even more, destroy its circadian rhythm, by permanently turning flashy lights on and off, stress the rat with a high continuous tone, and suddenly the rat's dead. What caused its death? Now the sausage tastes bad! To me it looks like a purification process: Nature helps itself, only the strong survive. How's it being called? Natural selection! Also has its good points: It makes room for the others! The healthy are evil, they mistreated the ill, the terror of the doctors, as well as of official persecutors, all anger of the healthy ones, directed at ill persons once, but now trombones sound, the values of society descend, justice unsheathes, sick now are the healthy. Haha!! Hahaha! Seems like everything here is fit as a fiddle. Sebastian! Damn! Can't be true! Now they kick the bucket here as well. There, there lies another one! -Don't go out, professor. Heribert! -Are you insane? Don't touch! Clearly the man's dead! Nobody can help him. C'mon, let's drive on, professor! I thought you wanted to drive to L?neburg? Why don't you stay in the car? Let me out of here! I want to get out! Let me out! -Don't be silly! Remain seated! -The dead, Heribert, I wanna see the dead! Please let me see the dead! Enough! You remain seated! Period! Stop it! You'll regret that! You healthy fatso! You bagful of shit! Brainless gorilla! I'll demolish everything! Ok, if you want to at all costs, then die, you idiot! Hello? Hello? Anyone here? Why did they all die at the same time? Hello? Hello? Do you think the disease is infectious? Hmm? What's the meaning of infectious? Not only viruses are transferable. Worms, radioactivity, and even climate can be infectious, feelings, passion. But here we're talking about the dead. Feelings and passion brought more death over humanity then Black Death. Be quiet! I thought I heard music. They went at each other. Or did they fear something? Doesn't this affect you at all? Say something! What should I say? Help!! Help!! Murderer!! Murderer!! Someone please help me! Come here! Help! Aaah! Ah! Jah! Someone help! Come here! Go away, go away! Murderer! Muah! Aaaaaah! Go back! Stop that! -Sebastian! Cannibals! Come here! Aah! Aah! Aah! Jah! Damn pigs, stop that! Quick! What are you doing? Hands off, you're getting yourself into trouble! That's disgusting! Disgusting! You make me wanna puke! I'll no longer let you into my car! Ottokar, I ask you one last time: Do you come with us? Yes or no? Fuck off, asshole! Heartless monster! When seeing you, you make us wanna puke! You pollute the air! -I'm driving away! Go! I'm driving away! Go! I'm driving away! I'm sick of caring about you! -I'm driving away! You huge brainless baby! I'm just as sensitive as you! But what you're doing is foolish! You're dumber then the pigs! You all belong into the nuthouse! For all I care you can drop dead, all of you, but without me! I... I proceed alone... With arrow, with bow, through mountain and valley, comes marching the archer, early in the morning rays. Ulrike! I wrote a poem for you! Huh? Where did you come from? Huh? What the... Ulrike? There! Don't we look fancy! Hehe! Ulrike!? Sebastian!? Look at that! You'll be amazed! Come over here! A living human! I found him! A splendid fellow, hm? What are you doing here? -I made you tea. You want some? Yes, thanks! No, what I mean is, How long have you been here? Did you witness what happened in this village? Yes... I was in every house. It's quite peaceful everywhere. Sugar? No, thanks. I like such trailers! A client from Giessen ordered it, custom-made. This thing is not easy to drive, as I'm in charge, substitutional for the factory, so to speak. Namely I'm in the business of delivering trailers. Till now I always delivered them in perfect condition. Never had a complaint. Aren't you afraid? I'm resistant to the disease. Why are you so sure? This is his message. There's someone who wants to talk to us. -Aha. Sebastian!? Second survivor sighted! Seems to be in rude health too! -Where? Up there, on the roof! Hey! Can we help you? What're you doing up there? Take care or you'll catch a cold! You are all infected! Nobody will survive! We won't do you any harm! Climb down! I don't want the blanket. It's surely full of germs! You can go into the trailer, there you'll be alone. Brand new model, luxury style. Nobody used it yet. I hope I can count on you! What happened here? Go back! You're way too close! We just want to know what happened. They splashed me! With blood and puke! On purpose! That's why I threw away everything. They took my car and drove away. I beg you, stay back! I threw away my undies too, it was dirty, but because of me, I was scared! What's your name? Why? Fritz! But that's nothing to you! The trailer's awaiting you. You can put on my Sunday suit. Tell me, at which stage did the sick turned agressive? Please, show some discretion! How did it begin? -Leave me alone! One of the first measures during the state of emergency are the restriction of individual freedom and the ban on private transport. Offenders are to be institutionalized in one of the central health camps. The Secretary of the Interior stresses: "Those who endanger common welfare cannot expect consideration from the community." "Only our strong combined will can create effective strength." Stop in front of the fence! -Let the people get out of the car! Drive closer! -Get out of the car! Closer! Hello!? What's up? I want to get out immediately. We're in front of L?neburg. L?neburg is worse than Hamburg for sure! Attention, attention! Please stay on the right lane and follow the detour signs. Attention, attention! Police speaking! Stay on the right lane! Where should we go now? -Please don't make any trouble. Can't you at least direct us to a hotel? Or tell us where to spend the night? Please drive on! We can't force anybody to keep his hotel open. We're living in a democracy! But I have to visit my institute. -Even if you're the Queen of England! You won't get in! What do you think how many people come down from Hamburg!? All down to the south, with bag and baggage! Although they weren't even allowed to leave! I think I'll take these. -One costs 2.50 Deutsche Mark (DM). I'll wear it, please. -Good, then take it. You have to buy what you touch. -Do you really think this helps? With the gloves that makes: 9.50 DM. -That's pure rip-off! Come closer! Come closer! Come closer! Give me that! -You won't find a single mask in L?neburg. All sold out! -Help! I need a doctor! Where's a doctor? Help! -Breathing protection with gloves, a complete set for 7.50 DM. -Don't touch him! Dude, are you crazy? Boy, go over there! -Here you pay for your survival! Drive closer! -Drive the car closer! Yes, yes, yes, I hear you! -Closer! [unintelligible] Medic! -Medic! Let us drive on! Please, now! Now they'll kill everyone! It starts, like at the village! Wait, wait, that's interesting, how did it start in your village? The vaccine, they're all vaccinated. Now they get aggressive! You've all been vaccinated? Who vaccinated you? The medics, who else? -The medics vaccinated you all? Well, not me! I went to the roof! -With what were you vaccinated? Sausages, people! Buy fresh sausages! Sausages, people! Buy fresh sausages! The true 'Hamburger Reinbeisser'! Fresh and firm! Firm and fresh! 5.50 DM, 50 pfennigs are for you. Here! -Sausages! How much do you take for the sausages? -5 DM for you! By the way, I have to try to enter L?neburg alone. Thanks for taking us with you! That's a rip-off! -You think it's a rip-off? This place teems with contaminated people. I risk my life. There, just look at them! Stay away from my sausages! I'm done with you, once and for all! This I tell you! Keep your hands off the goods. -He's from Hamburg! These are contaminated sausages! -Sausages from Hamburg! He's from Hamburg! All this stuff should be burned! -Yes, we should burn it! Police! Police! -Get fire and fuel! [turmoil] What's happening? Goddammit! Can't you tell them... [turmoil] Give me the fire! [turmoil] You dogs! You pigs! You'll pay for this! You have... [unintelligible] My living! Over there! [turmoil] What's taking you so long? Come! Quick! They shoot! -They shoot! Quick! Take care, they shoot! They shoot! They shoot! Dogs! Damn dogs! They shoot! Go! Attention, attention! Police speaking! Clear the field! Betake yourself to the accomodations immediately! [unintelligible] ...more information... [unintelligible] ...further instructions! Free entrance to L?neburg can't be anticipated within the next few days! There must be a way into the city. I must visit Hammerschmidt at all costs. Where do you want to go? -L?neburg! No problem, get on! -Come! Stop! Halt! Halt! Ulrike, I'm totally confused. Maybe we'll never find out the cause of the disease. Actually what's a disease? To be afraid of the disease? The aftermath of the treatment? Maybe we have to fundamentally... Sebastian? Sebastian? What's with you? I just thought about adrenalin, which gets unleashed by our body because of emotions, but can cause physical effects if not metabolized fast enough. It was wrong to search the dead for external symptoms. Where's your motorbike? Didn't you have a motorbike? No wind this evening. Pardon? As a boy I swam across the river. Back and forth. And you know what? Tomorrow I'll try it again. Where are we? Are we actually going in the right direction? Are we still moving at all? Ulrike, come over here! You hear that? Music! A strange tone. I sometimes hear that catchy tune, I don't even know what it is. Hello. Good evening. The old town has been cleaned up, next in line for tomorrow is Melbeck, right. They made an advance in Dahlem. If they don't pay us the commission, we just stay at home for once, then they can watch everything overflow. Well done, neat! Cool! -Exactly! [unintelligible] -I take a look. -Ouch. Give it to me! Give it to me! Yes, dude. Hmm. Hmmm! They come! Run! Aaaaaaah!!! Aaah!! Aaaaaaaah!!! Aaaaaahahahaha!! My sister lives over there, We can spend the night there. Aaaaaaaaahahaha! They were here already. "Mortal danger; Usage of this apartment is prohibited." "Infringements are being penalized with a 5000 DM fine." "?69, clause..." They screwed out the fuses. Do you think your sister's dead? Maybe they took her into quarantine. What's this smell? -Formaldehyde, disinfectants. Yuck, this stuff is all over the place. I lived here for two years, while I was working for Hammerschmidt. I have to call him. Back then we worked on a research contract which dealt with errors during cell division. Every day a chimp died, up to the point where they refused to give us more chimps. At the end 17 died, I think. The first dead I saw reminded me of that. And you know why? All 17 died in this fetal position. I'll call the institute, maybe they know where I can find him. Usually the reception is always manned, even at night! I must call Gerda, she's probably worried. I'll run you a bath. ...identify the broken mast and the overthrown loading crane. The capital itself is 70km away from the epicenter, but even here it's impossible to measure the whole degree of demolition. Consistantly we meet people fleeing in fear of a new earthquake. Others are searching for survivors, either with primitive equipment or with their bare hands. I'm out of words to even passably describe the humane tragedy that's happening here. The agony, the sorrow of thousand and thousands, who lost their immediate family in nothing more than eleven seconds, is undescribable. There's no water! In my 23 years as a reporter from all over the world, I've never seen something as harrowing as these horrifying pictures caused by nature. Now, 16 hours after the devastating earthquake, conditional on the scorching heat, the scent of decay already covers the city. Danger of epidemic is imminent. First estimations... Viruses are always present. ...talk about 80.000 to 100.000 dead, making it the biggest earthquake that mankind encountered in this century. Only under certain premises they get active, and take control over our body. The condition. In our evening program we're showing the documentary "The invisible army". It depends on our condition. At first we visit an exceptional amateur dramatic group, the "Garchinger Falken". It's sufficient that a virus infects a cell so that the cell divides itself indefinitely. The cancer cell sprawls continuously. A proof for immortality? I have a small cottage in the mountains. We'll be going there! Sebastian? Dear... You hurt me! Sebastian! Sebastian! On the L?neburg Heath In that beautiful land I go up and I go down All sorts on the way I find Valleri Vallera and yoohirassah Valleri Vallera and yoohirassah Dearest love, dearest love For you know, for you know it sure Brothers let our glasses clink For the Muscateller wine Will get sour from standing too long Every drop must be drunk up Valleri Vallera and yoohirassah Valleri Vallera and yoohirassah You can't simply back off, dude! -I didn't back off! I apllied the brakes! -Damn, you can't drive like that, dude! Here, take a look at my car! Yes, now take a look at mine! -Darling, call the police! We don't have to put up with this! -This ornamental ring cost me a fortune! I just got it back from the dealer's garage! But you drove against me! -Yeah, right! I didn't even see you! Better help me! -I call the police! Open the door! -Hurry up, darling! Look, a tank! Step back! -How rude. Step back, dude! Are they crazy? They're nuts! That's one of the Tommies, they go nuts because they can't leave. Look, police is already here! This is German Police! Stop immediately! Please go out of the tank! Please stop! This is German police! Stop immediately! Stop! Do as you are told now! You has to... [unintelligible] Please, this region is nature reserve! No for tanks! You must go out of the... Oh! Oh! Oh! No, no, no, no, no! Don't be silly! No, don't follow me! Stop immediately! Stay back, girl! -Come back! Watch out, the tank! Stop, stop immediately! Get lost! Are you nuts, you ugly mosquito? Get lost! Manage your dispute somewhere else! Not directly above me! I knew it! Hey, Ulrike, where's our cute little professor? Dead. He already looked a bit pale, I knew he won't make it much longer. Haha, told you! Hahahaha. Help, I'm jammed! They squash my foot! The branches! Beware! Caution! I come! Step back down there! Catch me! Let go! I got you, let go! -I beg you, be gentle to me! Oh, my foot, oh, my foot! Ulrike, I'd like to introduce you to our new traveling companion. This is Anna-Maria with her baby Giovanni. Hello! -They want to go to Genoa. And this is Luisa. -Buon Giorno. Hello. I hope we'll have a safe journey together. Into the garbage with the plate! I, I... [Italian swearing.] Unhygienic! My motto is: Throwaway items! Heeeey! What's up again? Ouch!! But autobahns are prohibited. Emergency Regulation. Infringements are being penalized with impoundment of the vehicle and imprisonment of 14 days and above! Ouch! "Swollen"! Alexander, you know you're driving on the wrong side? Yes, because I'm driving in the wrong direction. They drive on the right, that's the left from our viewpoint, hence you should drive on the right. Drive on the right lane! I thoroughly thought it over! To the right! Sebastian? What music do you like to listen to? I'll try to make contact with him. Morse from the other side. He's listening for sure. What are you telling us? He's here. I have contact. I'm feeling insanely good. [They sing an Italian song.] Wrong, you wind the wrong way! Wind the other way round, gently! Quick, quick, quick! Always quick, always everything quick! Can't stand it no longer! Me tired of you! Always nagging, always nagging, always nagging only! What's up now!? -People is ill because of that! Oh, oh, Alexander! -Luisa! Oh, ouch! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Alexander! Luisa attacked me! Now come! Take a look yourself! [unintelligible] [Speaks Italian and cries.] Here she died. On the German autobahn. [Speaks Italian] Nature spun its yarn, peaceful and with great pleasure The eternal wisdom set the earth' dimension, Pinned its feet and created the corner stone An azure horizon arose from the muddy streams of prehistoric rivers And warmed pulsating blood vessels with his light Prehistoric wisdom drove the ostrichs to bury their eggs into the sand, where they were hatched by the sun. Nothing more crosses my mind. I don't know how to continue. Amen. I'm pleased that she was Italian, it always was my dream to read Dante in its original language. So what, she's dead, someone has to take care about the baby. Anna-Maria! Pacifier!? [Talks Italian.] A toast to the disease! Disease! Haha! These times are magic moments, where trombones call out to humanity to redesign its fate. And thats the chance for felicity. When I was still very young, I once woke up early in the morning because a cock carked. The kitchen door was open, the valley beneath was full of fog. It smelled of freshly cut grass. My grandfather sang in the stable. I was very happy. You're nuts! Remembering is a symptom of the disease! That's what they found out. They know that from the infected. Before they die they remember their childhood. Their whole life plays back backwards. Then they grin, then they go into fetus position. When I had the accident, by a hair, the truck approached me, tremendous, tremendous, tremendous, tremendous. Everything happened so fast. My first day at the bank. My confirmation. Ms. Eberle beats me at the kindergarten. I'm wet. Go back even further. When you were in the womb. And then to your former lives. And further, when you were a fish. Plant, bacterium, primordial soup. Aether in the endless universe. I feel very good. [INFECTED AREA! BEWARE, RISK OF INFECTION!] [The national anthem of the Federal Republic of Germany is being played.] Dear fellow citizens, the Chancellor of the FRG is dead. Like so many of this country's citizens, he's a victim of this horrible disease which so unexpectedly attacked us. Let's prove ourselves as mature citizens in this hour. We won't let grief and despair control us. [Chantings: "We want water!"] With all respect due to the dead, first and foremost we have to remain calm and cool-headed. [WE WANT WATER!] [THE GOVERNMENT SLEEPS!] [QUARANTINE WINNERS OF THE CRISIS!] [EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO HEALTH!] [DOWN WITH THE PROFITEERS!] Only if we continue to face the threat, [unintelligible] we sense the attacks of corrosion, destruction and anarchy and nip them in the bud, we will keep our beautiful city from being destroyed by this plague! Folks, folks, folks, the good times are gone! You destroyed everything! Shut up fucker! [unintelligible] No, no, I'm terrified! We'll all gonna die! No, I'm terrified! [QUARANTINE WINNERS OF THE CRISIS] [Chantings: "We want water!"] In the face of the seriousness of the situation, I ask you to sing with me the last verse of the [unintelligible] song. Oh believe father [unintelligible] [unintelligible] Drive, drive. Fritz, Fritz, close the door! Down with the [unintelligible] Disperse! Disperse! The water supply will [unintelligible] Please be considerate! This is our only home! [EVERYONE HAS A RIGHT TO HEALTH!] -[Chantings: "We want water!"] Stop yelling! [THE RICH SPLURGE AND OUR BELLIES ARE EMPTY] Hey! I only want to deliver the trailer! Please! Don't touch! This is property of the factory! Don't do that! [turmoil] [Chantings: "We want water!"] It's not there, I'll take a look round the corner. ...please! Please step back! Step back! Corpse carrier, corpse carrier! Make way! Corpse carrier! Corpse carrier! Make way! Corpse carrier! Make way! Please make way! -Make way, dammit! Corpse carrier! Make way! Corpse carrier! Corpse carrier! Make way! Corpse carrier! Make way! Corpse carrier! Make way! Corpse carrier! Corpse carrier! -Corpse carrier! Corpse carrier! Someone must be there?! Maybe they are too scared to sell something. What's up? I bring you the trailer. What? -Yes, it's parked round the corner. The trailer is here! Mother, the trailer is here! Open the door! Mother, mother, the trailer is here! Come, there he is! Quick, open the door! Come! Wait, wait! We're not ready yet! Finally, there it is! What are they doin' in my trailer? Do they belong to you? Yes, they helped me. The new trailer... Well, father! -With this I'll easily drive over the Brenner pass! Look! The pane's broken. Didn't you notice that? No, I was overjoyed. Quiet down, Ottokar's sleeping. The dishes are dirty! And the table is broken! And the good blanket! Where's the blanket we ordered? Now, do you take the trailer or not? I can take it back as well. Where's the blanket we ordered? I immediately want to know where it is! Totally overcrowded! Private party! What kind of people are they? Hello! Where are you coming from? You know them? Hello, how are you doing? Cheers! [Spanish singing.] Come, eat and drink! Enjoy yourself! Hey, Alexander. Heribert is here, the sausage seller, look at him. He's dressed to the nines, he probably made a lot of money. Hi! Hello! Hello! Great vibes. Excuse me. What are you swallowing? -Sleeping pills. Don't you like it here? -One may not start dreaming. We have to enter the deep sleep phase directly or else we'll remember and all's over. You're a defeatist, huh? -He's [unintelligible] Dude, you oversleep the upswing. The future's looking rosy. At one stroke the crisis loosened the gordian knot that [unintelligible] the people with liberal views until yesterday. Co-determination, environmentalism, the whole rubbish, all went down the Rhine of the German soul! Soon everything will collapse. We'll have enough jobs again, an unimagined backlog demand for [unintelligible], right, Heinz? Limitless growth. Paradise. Ooooooh! Horrible! -[unintelligible] Leave the body, soul! Be happy! I wish you a safe journey! Aaaaaah! Hahahahaha! Music, music, music! Vibes! Give me that! Go out! Kick him out! Aaahhhhh! Henrich, my dear, what's with you? Drink, my friend! Drink! Anna-Maria!? What's with you? Anna-Maria!? Alexander! Alexander! If one shoots into chaos, order is inevitably being restored! Everyone to the side! Go out in groups of two! Women on the left, men on the right! Go, go! Hurry up! Everyone's infected, put them into quarantine! You can't put people... please! The quarantine would be our death! He wants to bribe us! Look at these sods! Hahaha! We only want your money and your valuables, then you can go! Is that clear!? And now everyone into the other room! You shitheads, at least leave our wives alone! Ouch! Outrageous! Bunch of sods! Move! Everyone into the other room! Didn't you hear him? [unintelligible] Chin up, chest out! Suck in your stomach! Hah!! You and me, we're a good team! We're the greatest! Haha, Heribert! Hah! Got to leave this town, leave this town And you, my dear, stay here When I'm back, when I'm back When I'm back again, back again, Back again, back again, On your doorstep I'll appear. What's this? Don't come any closer! Woe betide you! If you come any closer, you'll get a nasty surprise! Look, they all have clubs! Oh, that's you! What a pleasure to meet you here! How are you? -Fine, and you? All violets died off, she left me. I just can't water all the flowers alone! Most important to me is, er, the movement, so I stay healthy, I want to live a long, long time. Where are you going to? To the south, young lady! We're restless wanderers without a permanent home. In search for the Archimedean point so to speak. Got to leave this town, leave this town... Take care! -Now lets go, now lets get away To the south! But the south is... this way... When I'm back, when I'm back When I'm back again, back again, Back again, back again, On your doorstep I'll appear Lalalala lala lalala Lala... A boat, with it we can cross the river! Little seagull, fly to Helgoland I am lonesome and abandoned And I ache for her kiss Homeland... What do you want here!? This is my house! I locked myself in so they can't catch me. Who wants to catch you? The professors, they think there are too many humans on this world, and they're getting more and more. And they're all standing ass-to-ass and so they smeared poison everywhere. And that stuff stinks, horrible! Go, we have to hurry up! Every man for himself! Close your eyes, ears and nose! Alexander, help me! -Carola, how are you? I'm cold. -Try to relax. Don't resist, we're with you. We hear you. You're not ill. You are not Carola, others speak through you. Who are you? Speak to us! What do you want to tell us with this disease? We want to understand you. We need your knowledge. What shall we do? Whoever you are... help us! We are ready now! Alexander, stop it, please! I can't take it any longer! You won't see me again! You're nuts! Her clothes are totally wet. -We must rub her with alcohol. Look, it's amazing what's out there. Ahaha! Come, it's ok! The water's dirty anyway. We better clean it with ground and grass. Ground? Is that healthy? -Yes, sure, it's way cleaner. We'll search for a cow! We'll be back soon. -Don't stay away for long! [DECONTAMINATED ZONE III - Entering the area ist strictly prohibited.] [Admission only through the checkpoints. -The Provincial Government] In India I had a friend who lay in the bathtub for hours. He loved to completely submerge. One day he drowned in there. Maybe we all want to get back into the amnion sac? Back to a new beginning. We're no longer the rulers of the world. Ulrike? Did you ever asked yourself why I deliver trailers? One can't flee all the time. One has to survive the adventures in ones own country. Even when sometimes they are little, grey adventures. Hey, you! Stand up! Hands up! I just took milk for the baby. Doesn't matter, I'm not dying. You murderer. Hubertus Five, please report. HQ? -Yes, here headquarters. Found two persons at the lakeside. What shall we do with them? Take the arrested to the security gate. Then meet Hubertus Ten. Yes, we also need a hearse. The evader raised an object that looked like a bomb. We had to shoot him. -Here, take it! Take your shoes off. Please hand over your valuables. -[REGISTRATION] A necklace... made of silver. A jewellery ring. -In here, please. [SHOWERS] [OUTER CLOTHING -HAND OVER-] Take off your outer clothing here. Please take off the [unintelligible]. Go! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Ah! Aaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaaah! Aaaaaah! Aaaaah! Aaaaaah! Quit acting up! Mr. Feger, Mr. Feger. Here comes your uncle doctor and brings out the big guns. This weapon won't do wonders but we want to give the the disease as hard a time as possible. But I'm not ill. -How do you want to prove that, my dear? Nobody knows whether he's healthy or not. That's why we have to treat everyone in order to win this war. We all have to take part and we don't need someone who's awkward. Aaaaah!! Stop it! What's got into you? Dammit! Out of the way! -My coat! [unintelligible] What the heck is going on here? Catch her! Go, go, go, go, go! Once again I want to summarize, our range of products contains everything, like this simple, protective sheath, weighing just a couple of grams which, in combination with a respirator, can be used during the transport of infected people. For such cases we also have, as a more complete protection, this two-part PVC protective suit, which has to be worn in combination with a respirator. As you know, the viruses can enter our body through the mucous membranes of the eyes. But I can see you're experts, so lets talk serious. Only this heavy protective suit can give you a complete protection from your environment. Yes, I, oh, er, demonstrate it to you with these two models. Start the compressor! Er, this shapely and becoming model, T114, er, put this, ok, Like you can see on this model, they of course can also get the oxygen... Hey! Heribert! ...from a portable compressed air bottle... -Ulrike is here. What? Pardon me? Ulrike? I'm pleased. Come! Come! Hurry up! We must run, run! Plant him one on his kisser, Heribert! Yes, haha! We'll make it! Come! That's the liberty! Haha, haha! Up there. To the mountains. Gloria in excelsior! Praise God! Our prayers got answered! The disease has been defeated! Hallelujah! Friends! Brothers! I'm chuffed to bits! Hallelujah! We made it! -One beer short of a sixpack, huh? We made it! We made it! Praise God! Only thanks to the valuable help of the whole population was our country able to pass this terrible test. Thank you! Thanks to all the individuals! Bravo! But danger's not yet averted! We need your help to find those that have not yet been vaccinated. Hello! Did you hear the news? The disease is beaten! Be cautious! Look into every suspicion! I'm so glad! Finally I can work again! No more deaths! The disease is over! In this case carelessness can be a crime too. Lies! They fool you! Help! Let me go! I'll get you! I'll get you! I'll get you! See, first nobody wanted to help us. Now we should let them cope with it by themselves. "Whole Europe contaminated! Chancellor offers technical and organizational help." I wouldn't do that. Assholes! Don't you notice what game they're playing!? I can't believe it! You have to fight them tooth and nail! Shut up you cripple! The world is ill! This was only a first warning! The next catastrophe comes for sure! Heh! You can't beat up a cripple... [tumult] Stop! Stop! Ho, ho, ho! Tempo! Step on it, dude! Step on it! Up there! Grandfather! -Yes? Look! Beautiful girl. Does it still suit me? -Yes, wonderful! Ulrike! Ulrike! No, no, I don't want to! No! No! No! Grandfather! No! Grandfather, help me! So help me! Grandfather! No! Now that was a very short visit, huh? There she goes again. Huh. Yes, girl, I'll yodel for you. Or sing. Do you know where the blanket is?
