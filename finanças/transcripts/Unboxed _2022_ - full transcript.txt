Hey, guys. Hola, mi gentío! [whispers] Come on, man. You can do this. You're a star. You do this all the frickin' time. Hola, mi gente! [gently] Okay. [bright pop instrumental playing] Hey, guys! Hola, mi gente! I am so, so frickin' excited to be here -with you guys tonight. -[thunder crashes] I have a new look coming up, which, of course, will have you guys looking fuego as per usual. But I am feeling extra generous tonight because I'm the luckiest girl in the world. We just reached... a million followers! I can't believe it. All because of you guys. And in fact, some of you fantastic friends have marked the occasion by sending me some special gifts. You guys are the best, and I love you so much. I am so frickin' thankful for you guys. Thank you to Nikita278 for this facial roller! Oh, my goodness. I don't have one yet, surprisingly. And I cannot wait to use it. And of course, pink. My favorite color. You guys know me so frickin' well. Thank you to KuanaKitty for this lip plumper. My favorite brand. Of course, which you guys know. Can't wait to use it. I'll let you guys know how it goes. And thank you to my biggest fan, Casey16. She sent me my favorite, gummies. Oh, my goodness. You guys are the best. Oh, my gosh. There's a card, too? "You did it!" Let's see what it says. Ugh, "Congrats on the one million, to the girl who's one in a million." My heart. Oh, my gosh, I am so frickin' happy. I don't deserve you guys. You didn't have to do this. I should be the one thanking you guys, more than ever. In fact, to say "thank you," we're gonna do a very special million-versary giveaway! So, give me a second. I'm gonna eat some of these. I'll be right back. [music stops] [gags] Oh, my God. What the hell? [retches] Bleh. [thunder rumbling] Ugh. Okay. [clears throat, music resumes] All right, guys. Let's start with some fun. Who wants to look fab with this sugar scrub from Coco Cosmetics? All you have to do is wet your face, put some on your hands, rub it on your face. Wash it off, and you guys are gonna have glowing skin. I guarantee it. This is the brand I use. This is the scrub I use. A lot of you have asked me-- [clears throat] -- um, how I have great skin. [clears throat] Sorry, guys. [sighs] So, all you have to do is type in #Ria's-- [clears throat] [sighs] [thunder crackles loudly] Uh, some storm, huh? Anyway. [moans] Sorry, guys. Where was I? So, with this makeup look, you just apply it... [sighs] [loud thumping] What the-- 'Lo? I'll be right back, guys. [clears throat] [thunder crackles] [clears throat] [quietly] I think these storms just... have me a little... on edge. [music volume lowers] So... For the makeup look... [thunder rumbles] [ominous music] [sputtering] [choking] [gagging] [choking] [Kody] All right, last one and you'll be good -for the quiz tomorrow. -[Laura] 'Kay. [Kody] The endoplasmic reticulum is a network of...? [Laura] Membranous tubules within the cytoplasm of a-- Po-- Of a eukaryotic cell. And it usually has what attached to it? Um... Okay, I know this. Um, uh, ribosomes! That is correct. Nicely done. -So, it all makes sense now? -Yes. Finally, it does. Thanks, Kody. Saving me again, man. Funny how I've never been good at science, huh? Well, you know, your dad was a pretty big inspiration for me to go pre-med next year. [Laura] Oh, well, he'd be happy to hear that. He always loved showing you his science gadgets and stuff. Hey, remember that time you cut your leg and he showed me how to do the stitches? Oh, God, don't remind me. You know, I still act like such a baby around needles. Just-- Just blood and ugh! [Jess] Hey, guys. Check out this article on Ria Reeves going AWOL. What does it say? [Jess] "Missing or publicity stunt? Thirteen reasons why social media star, Ria Reeves, could be faking her own disappearance." Come on, Jess, that's probably just some clickbait article. I'm sure she's okay. And plus, honestly, it-- it probably is just a publicity stunt. I mean, you know those YouTube stars, they'll do anything for more subscribers, right? -Yeah. -[Kody] I don't know. I saw Ria Reeves' last live stream -and something was-- -Bah, bah, bah, bah! You were watching a cosmetics live streamer? -[chuckling nervously] -[Jess] Mm-hmm. -[phone ringing] -Oh, okay. -Oh. -[answering call] Hey, Dawn, I'll call you back in two minutes. Hey guys, I've got to take this. Um, happy Halloween. Have fun at Taylor's party tonight. Happy Halloween, babe. You text me if you can come by after work. Good luck, Laura. I know you'll be amazing. Break a leg. [snaps fingers] Relax, Kody. She's not making her debut on Broadway. Sometimes I forget you're my cousin. What are you talking about? If you want a chance with Laura, then maybe stop mentioning how you watch girly YouTube shows on your free time. She probably thinks you're gay. Whatever. [birds squawking] Hey, wait! You're my ride home! [FaceTime outgoing ringtone] Laura, what's the deal? You were supposed to put the first video out an hour ago. I know. I'm sorry. I just lost track of time. -I'll do it right now. -Please. Also, did you check if all the sponsor boxes got to you okay? Yeah, I think they did. You think so? We're this close to game time and you think so? I'm gonna need a solid "Yes" on that ASAP-- I know. I know. I'm on my way home right now to get you that solid "Yes." On another note, got some more potential sponsors tuning in tonight. They're looking for someone with pizzazz. And by that I mean some sex appeal, if you wouldn't mind putting on a tight little costume or something. Okay. You know my brand isn't that type. I'm simply considering how to get you more views. Yeah, consider something else, please. You put so much time into this. Maybe you should think of more risqué opportunities. All right, all right, all right. I'll think about it, okay. That's all I ask. Have a wonderful stream tonight. The world will be watching. Oh! Gotta run. I have a meeting. Bye, Dawn.

I was thinking of maybe checking it out, but without you, it's not gonna be as much fun. So, you know, I'll just stay in, watch some lame horror movie or something.

Good news for me, too. I think that after tonight, I might get Lala a new offer from Juicy Lips. [snickering] I mean. Okay.

There is one thing that I should mention. -Um... -[Jeff] Go on... They want to lock her up, keep her exclusive from the market. [chuckles] Yeah, I mean, I agree with him. But ever since we lost our, uh, last client that vanished into thin air, um, we've been bleeding money. So... Yeah, Dawn, I'll give you-- I'll give you a chance. I won't let you down.

Uh, yeah. -[sighs] -Let me guess. Laura. Uh, no. Jeez, Kody, you got to get over this. You're way to deep in the friend zone with her, man. Besides, there's plenty of other fish in the sea. And no better time than Halloween to cast your rod, -if you know what I mean. -[Kody] Ew. [laughs] Listen, you're tall, good-looking and really sweet. And you're gonna be in pre-med next year, which basically means you're the top 1% of all eligible bachelors. Well, apparently that's not good enough, because I'm not a stupid jock. Hmm, stupid jock with really nice eyes and gorgeous hair. Look, I'm just joking! I just popped molly. I'm not gonna waste it anymore on your sob story, okay? So, let's go. Nah... Come on, primo. Look, you may not have Laura tonight, but you have a chemically-induced, happy cousin who loves to be an excellent wing woman. And besides, your A's aren't too bad. They're just a B version of mine. [chuckles] Thanks. That's probably just the molly talking, but I'll take it. Probably. Hey, do you want some? No, I'm good. All right. Suit yourself. Now, come on. Let's go get wasted! That's what Halloween's all about! [sighs] [Laura] And that's the answer to my scariest Halloween ever. Let's see, who else has a fun question? Getting some really great questions from you guys.

Uh, I think you-- I think you need to let me be the one doing the talking here. Why didn't you answer the door immediately? Uh, because I'm doing a livestream. [officer] A livestream? There's serious crime out there and I'm dealing with a livestream? Wow. [scoffs] I don't really care what you're doing. When an officer of the law is at your door, you answer it right away. You understand? Yes. Sorry. How can I help you? Got a call about a suspicious package given to little girl in the neighborhood. You know anything about that? No, I don't think so. Anybody else home? Nope. It's just me. But I really do need to get back to this, um-- Look. What you did not only scared the little girl, but it's also illegal. Do you understand that? Yes, of course. I'm so-- I'm sorry. I-- It's a huge misunderstanding. Some viewers decided to mess around by pranking me and i-- it got out of hand. Nothing like this will ever happen again, I promise. What's in the box? Uh, it's just candy. No-- What? Uh, it-- it's expired. I'll take my chances.
