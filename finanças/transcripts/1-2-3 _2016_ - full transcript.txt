Luis! What are you laughing at? Luis! Ending up empty-handed again? I don't think you were able to get any. You're so lazy. Do you think this is just a game? This one is so big! What? This is a lot! - Shall we buy, Lulu? - I hope so. Used items are arriving tomorrow. - What are you going to sing, Lulu? - It's a surprise, Father! Surprise, surprise. Is your money enough for a new costume? - Where are you buying it? - At the flea market. Miss Eme, Nico just texted. - Nico? - I meant his wife. - What did she say? - She sent you money. That flirt. Stop pretending. She's sending you money. Does your father know? Lulu! Can you call your siblings? Hold on. Mom, we don't have rice anymore. Oh, right. Go get some. Were you able to sell anything today? I'm saving it for Lulu's dress. The contest is tomorrow. What is that again? Can that contest feed you? Ask your father. We need to buy rice. Why are you asking me? Do I look like I have money? And weren't you fishing earlier? Lulu is buying a new dress for the contest. Bullshit! Is that contest more important now? Well, she wants to join. Hey, Luis. Don't provoke me. We've already spent all her savings. The contest is tomorrow. Pidong, what are you doing? - Such a nerve to talk back. - That's enough. - Your son has no manners! - Don't hurt him. - He can't be rude. - Don't hurt him! No one's joining the contest, okay? Lulu! Get over here! You started it, didn't you? You want to live there, get out of here? And how? How many true friends do I have? The kind who'll never leave me At those times I need them And when? When will I ever be heard? One day I hope to have the chance For me to serve them - Luis! - Hey! We have a contest to catch. It's too early for fishing. What now? These are still loose on you. Time check. How about this one? What about your usual attire? It's Luis' fault! Hey, I heard that! Let's go Lulu! Dad's here! No one's joining any contest. Cut it out! - Get out of here. - Let's go. Wear this one. - What will you wear? - Get out! Go away! Get out! I'll wear the usual one. Hey! Get off. Get off. Are you joining? What's your name? Lulu, sir. Lulu? She's number 5. Oh, my god. So, you're number 5. Didn't you bring a CD or accompaniment? I usually borrow from others. Oh, my lord. Where can we get one now? Good evening again, Santa Fe! I can't feel the energy! Louder this time! A round of applause, everyone! Number 5, your seat is over there. Our first contestant is none other than... April from Zone 7. A round of applause! We have one more surprise for you. Lulu! She's a small-but-terrible lady from Silag Island! A round of applause for Lulu! Who's that? - Do you know her? - No. I live my life alone Don't know where I belong So different from the people You used to know I live a lonely life Waiting for so long To meet someone who can spend their life With me Continue, it's nice. You're doing great. - You can do it, Lulu! - Go, Lulu! That's my sister! So where? Where are the friends of mine? Those who won't leave me When I'm in need And when? I wish you'd heard the person behind us. The old lady was so impressed. She said, "The girl is really talented." "Where does she live?" It's true. You think I'm kidding? And this noisy gay guy. She said, "Oh, gee, she's so fabulous!" - How did he say it? - "Oh gee, she's so fabulous." - Come now, little princess. - Fine. - Wait a minute. Isn't she number 5? - Yes, it's her. Right, it is you. You were so fantastic up there. Of course she was, that's why she lost. I send a lot of talents to audition for TV. Do you want me to manage you? You have so much potential. You just need to get more training. Develop a little more. How about I talk to your parents for you? No need. They're not gonna buy the idea anyway. Why even worry about that? Let's just try. Let me talk to them. I'll visit you. Which island are you from again? Silag. Tomorrow. Before I leave for Manila. No need, thanks anyway. Are you sure? All right. Just think about it, okay? - Do you have a telephone number? - Yes, we do. - Just save my number, okay? - Okay. 0927... 568... 0309. All set. - Take care. - Sure. Wow! You can be on TV. Oh my gosh, was that for real? I can't believe it. She was just joking. How could you even tolerate your sister? Your turn Lulu! Step closer. I told you not to join, didn't I? You don't really learn from beating? Dad! Dad, stop! - That's enough! - Pidong, that's enough! - Dad, stop! - Enough! - Enough! - You too. Get out of my way. Dad, that's enough! - Dad, that's enough! - Stop it! - Lulu! - Yes? Please bring this coal to Maricar's. Hold on. Ezekiel, look after Trisha. Are you all right? Has Ma'am Ditas texted you yet? No. Why? Do you want to text her something? When is she returning to Manila? We can ask. - Okay, let's text her. - Okay. Let me help you. Just the two of you? Mom said you can just call her. She might get worried. No, she won't. She has to take care of our siblings. Are you sure? Fine, as long as you know your local address. And... Hold on. Here's our address and phone number in Manila. Give these to your parents, okay? This is the contract that I signed. Looks like your girl got some luck. Is she famous already? Thanks heavens. She was just a nuisance in here. Didn't want to study. Didn't want to do anything but sing. Tell her to send some picture next time. Sure, thanks. Another letter just came in. It's with your mom. Let me know about the letter, okay? I want to write her too. Mom? This is not Lulu's handwriting. Huh? Can I see? It's from her manager. Lulu's busy now and can't write. But she wants to send you money. Where's the money? Here. Good for her. She's a big help already. I'll be sleeping now. Give me a second. Where is she going? Luis. Drop by the house later. We have a small get-together. I don't think I can. Mom will look for me. You can tell them. Your dad's going anyway. Did he hurt you again? Don't you really want to finish your studies? You can take remedial classes. I'll help you. Has Lulu written back? The one last month. I've been trying to call her, but she never answers. Must be busy training. So I'll see you later? Whatever. We rented a karaoke. And it's your turn to sing. Maricar. Does Nico still text you? Not recently. Why? No. Forget it. Do we have a problem? Can I... Can I send a text message instead? Hey. Come on in. Hon... Oh no, I haven't cooked yet. Luis, this is Mara. I've heard a lot about you. - How's that? - From Maricar. - Maricar? - The chieftain's daughter. The one you text when we send money. How did you know our messages? The whole island knows. What kind of island is this, Nico? - No privacy! - Privacy? What's that? So are you guys hungry? Actually, I'm not sure what to cook. I'm sorry. I just finished packaging some stuff. We're going home to the province. Has Nico told you? By the way, where is your sister? She's just in Sampaloc. We are finishing our studies in Ilocos. Are you hungry? - Have you eaten during your trip? - Yes. Can I see the address again? What's the name? Ditas. - Here in 23? - Yes, 23A. I don't know of anyone named Ditas. If you want, leave me your number. I'll let you know if she comes. - All right! - Let me get a pen. Hey! - Are you looking for Ditas? - Yes. Oh, no. Try San Pedro street. - San Pedro? - Yes. Behind Angel's Pad. She has another place there. Sure, thank you! Where are the letters coming from? Wait for me tomorrow. - Huh? - We'll go to San Pedro. Oh, dear. Why would she ends up there? How long is she gone now? More than two months. How about your parents? Don't they get worried? She sends money anyway. It's just around the corner. We can walk there. You can eat first. Don't worry, we'll go there first thing tomorrow. - Excuse me, sir. Do you know Ditas? - No, I don't. Is Ditas here? - Ditas? - Yes. There is no Ditas here. This is San Pedro, right? Yes, but there is no Ditas here. Try over there. But those are mostly hotels. This side has more houses. When you reach the corner, make a turn. Okay, thank you. Hurry! Let's go, girls! Let's go! Let's go! - You'd be better be a good boy. - Sure. Don't forget to share your blessings. Why did you just tell us know? This was yesterday? I wasn't sure. It was dark and far. It's good for the police to know why kids are going there. I hope they check it. Are you talking about the house with barbed wire? Yes. A missionary lives there. Mr. Arthur. You must have just seen his orphans. That's the point. Why would his sister be there? She wasn't sent to the missionary. Chief. - Okay. - All right, we'll give it a look. But for now, leave your number here. What is your sister's name? Girls, come in now. You're late. You're all so naughty. You're all over the place. Lulu. - What the... - Lulu! What are you doing here? Let's get out of here! I'm not Lulu. Rosie? Who's there? Get in here now. I'm not Lulu. Is something bothering you? Who was that boy you were talking to? Oh, no one. Just a random guy who suddenly approaches me. - Are you singing or dancing tonight? - She can't dance anymore. Otherwise we will be reported to NBI again. - That's crazy. - The NBI's looking for you. - Girls, are you ready? - Yes! Come on now. Juliet, you have a visitor. - Fix your face. - There you go again. That's what they like about you. Rosie, stay here first. Girls, get out of here. - Yes! - You look good already. Let's go. What happened here? - Dinah, let's go! - But my hair's still straight. Rosie, Let's go. Let's go, baby doll. Hey, girls. Get dolled up. Don't forget your perfume. - Yes. - Yes. Luis. We left our numbers with the police. They'll call if there are updates. I'll call Maricar as well. I also left her number. - Can you get home by yourself? - Of course! He came here by himself. No, I meant to the pier. I will send him off. What are you wrapping? It's okay, it's just one tricycle ride. No, Nico will take you there. Don't worry about us, we can take a bus anytime. - Did you leave him some money? - Yes, I gave him some. Here's some food. Food is expensive on the road. And please tell Maricar to stop broadcasting our texts! Bro? Over there. Hey! Get the hell out of here! That's my client! Get out! He's saying something. Where are you from? Go away! You're not even from here. Come here! Hurry up! You surely have a talent, don't you? Come in. You have a talent. How could you convince with that untidy look? Where did you come from anyway? If you want, you can live here. Everything's free. Your food, shelter. But of course, we'll have to see first. You should not disappoint James. - Reyna! - Yes? Hurry up. Give that kid some decent clothes. James is a very kind person. He's one of my regulars. Don't embarrass me, okay? Take care of him. Will you just take a quick shower? Hey! What? You want me to throw you into the washing machine? Oh, you have clothes after all. Can I see? You're too fussy. You'd better start moving. What now? Someone is waiting for you. He is asking which one do you want. Try it on. Mr. James, let me in! Mr. James, open the door! Open the door. Open the door! What are you looking at? Nothing. Where did you come from? Are you new? That explains it. He looks really young. He reminds me of you Rey. I was much younger. How old are you, bro? Fourteen. You were older. I was 12 then. Another day to be bored. What's up with these clients? - Too early to be like that. - This one's luckier. Luis. Did you get taken out last night? By Mr. James? Your baptism, right? - That explains it. - That's it. That must have cost a lot. How much did he tip, bro? Shanang surely made a good cut. I want to go out. - I want a new watch. - There you go again. You keep sweet-talking your way through everything. Sweet talk? It's fun to flatter the clients. You're full of crap. Crap? It's called strategy. Bring them to the shoe section. Pretend to be hesitant at first, but he'll buy you out. But don't give in yet. Say, "I am just looking." Then, they'll feel bad and buy it for you. It's too early to make love. Bastard, that's what you call early blessings. Hurry, give me the powder! Stupid, that's too much. Wait. Come on down. He's calling us, Luis. Make money downstairs. Remove your shirt. Cocoi. Take that off. Oh, well. - What the hell, Jonas. - It stinks! Have you eaten a rotten egg? Can I borrow? Someone might get it. Come on. Any will do. - Black or white? - The black one. Hey, Luis! Get something to eat already. Hurry, they might run out of food again. - This one or this one? - Yeah, that one. Thanks! Hey, get some breakfast! While Reyna's still there. - That looks new. - Of course. Hey! Can't you speak? What took you so long? We've got nothing left. We can share if you want. No? You don't want to? Don't be shy! Don't you want to accompany a pretty girl? How do you like it here? Why do you eat here? Sorry am I bothering you? Okay, I'm leaving. No, just kidding. Aren't the girls supposed to be on the other side? Well, they are. Not me. It's too crowded and rowdy there. How is it here? I'm okay. Have some meat. You'll lose weight. It's okay. You can have it. Eat some more. You might lose weight. You're mean! I've always been skinny. These girls... Sometimes I see them going... There. The pad? Sometimes. We're prohibited to go there. There are spies. What? They report to the police. So sometimes, we're told not to go there. - Police? - Crazy, right? They inform the police. Then the police send us warnings to Mrs. Kim and Mr. Arthur. Once the coast is clear, the group just goes back. I mean we, we go back. Here, take some more of the burnt rice. Is this your favorite? You're really mean. You ruined my appetite. You have to eat, you're too thin. - It might... - Might what? Might starve the butterfly on your head. Why keep making those things? Miss, my friend wants some action. - What's this perfect place called? - Angel's Pad. Usher him in. Here we go. Welcome to Angel's Pad. - This place looks fun. - Of course. Your bling-blings look very pretty. I made them myself. - Really? - Yes. This bracelet took me hours to make. - And these earrings as well. - This girl could be an artist. - You know a fashion designer, right? - Excuse me for a second. Go to Nota bar. Okay then. Bye sir. - How are you tonight? - We're good. - Have you ordered anything yet? - Yes. - How are they? - Perfectly fine. Excuse me, I'm going in. You're too young to be there. - Cut the crap. - Let me in. - One moment, Reyna. - Why? My customer wants to meet Luis. Hey! Hold on. I'll be back in a minute. Fine. My turn. Quickly! Come here! Check this out. - Wow, that's a lot! - How could you get this much? I told you just keep smiling. - Can I borrow that smile? - We can buy some make-up now! What's that now? Do you think we have a faucet running money? Fix that. I'll make it up to you soon. You sound like you are not taken care of. Fine. Fine. Settle this problem right away. Lulu! Let's get away from here. Let me go! Otherwise, I will call Sir Arthur. That man can have you killed. - Lulu, let's get out of here. - I'm not Lulu! You leave. Get out of here! Get out of my life! I'm not leaving here without you. Where have you been? Someone's been waiting. Are you okay? He's asking you how old are you are. Let's drink some more. Look at that. Someone ordered to-go. Not there in bed. To the bathroom. Wait. Smile. Drop! And turn. Girl, don't step on the fabric! - Girl, there you go again! - Don't you come back here, okay? What's with the rush? But Divine, you told me to end on that spot. Fine. It's too crowded here. Let's go downstairs. Bring the radio. Teach it to me please, Divine! Rica! Why aren't you rehearsing? What's the matter? Just because you're all made up, you're good? Have you proven anything? You're all teeth. All smiles. Get your ass down here! You know, I'm okay with this. Why should I leave? It's you who always leaves then keeps coming back. Rose! Come here! Try this on. And stop opening that window. We don't want peeping toms harassing us. Let's go! Let's go! - What did I say? - So pretty. You know I really do prefer it here. On the streets, it's hard looking for a place to sleep. And the most of our clients are penniless taxi drivers. - How about this one? - Give me a second. I am just bearing it. I'm almost losing my temper. On the other hand, who knows we meet a foreigner. Then take us to America. We can do whatever we want then. Isn't that fabulous? Just like our dance. - I heard Europe is better. - True. Don't be shy, okay? What if they get tired of you? Find someone in the audience who is looking at you. If you can't look them in the eye, look at their nose. Here, and... Would you remember everything I tell you? Reyna. What's up? Could you send this money for me? Rose, what's up? She wants to send money. Oh? Didn't we just send some? You're getting more clients these days. Actually, I want to get some CDs as well. Oh, you want to sing? Sure! Reyna will do it. - Buy one for her later, okay? - Sure. Luis! Are you ready for breakfast? I have set aside some for you. I had a feeling you'd wake up late. You know what, I was so impressed by you. You're good. Why can't you get over with burnt rice? It's really your favorite, isn't it? Burnt rice? This isn't burnt rice. You should thank me for ha saving you some. - What are your plans today? - Why? Are you gonna help me out? Sure. Are you sure? I am going to get drunk. Help me quick. Help me get drunk, you little macho man. Cheers! Sounds corny, right? Please choose, ma'am. A lot of great songs are in there. - Who is that for? - For Rose. That girl loves to sing. She sometimes sings at the bar. She's an amazing singer. Here, she'll love this one. Sarah? How can you say that? This is popular with kids nowadays. - Can I pay for this? - No, it's fine, she gave some money. Give it back to her. Tell her it's a gift from me. Just tell her. I get in for free at one of her concerts. - You don't even know her, do you? - We once spoke at the bar. Just for a while. But she did say she wanted to be a singer. Your change. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Quick! - You're annoying. Why are you so excited? Dirty! What a trash. You can't be picky. Is this your favorite place? Yeah. - Why? - You're so weird. - What do you mean? - You prefer burnt rice. Your favorite place in trash. That's too much. When you visit our island, you'll never wanna leave. Clean and fresh air. And no litter on the ground. When are you going home? What? Why would I go home? I mean... Of course, your parents. They were the ones who sold me away. Why would I go back? If I do, they'll just sell me again. What am I, recycled trash? How did they sell you? They just did! How is it done? You're given away, and they pay the one responsible. - Your parents? - Yes. I was young then. About four. Are you kidding me? Why would I? I didn't know people are sold nowadays. We only sold fish. Well, I'm not a mermaid for nothing. Si-reyna. It's in my name! Si-rey... Never mind. Si-rey... Corny. Finally, he laughs. You're too serious. So, you're a mermaid, huh? - Go home! - No, Luis, stop it! - Come on, take her! - Dirty. It stinks! You're cornier, so noisy. Reyna, please! You knew Allan was coming. Where have you been? - I just went to the market. - For three hours? You had to take Luis with you. What if he did something crazy? Go finish that. I'll call you to help me at the bar, okay? You don't even have muscles. - Where's my perfume? - Wait! Who's Allan? No one. Sir Arthur's friend. Sir Arthur owns the bar. Is this phone yours? Can I make a call? Do you know how to use it? Yes. - You soak it in the water, right? - Hey! You're so harsh on me. We have also got a phone in the island. You're so annoying. - What happened? - Nothing. Who was that anyway? Your girlfriend? No. Our neighbor. Here. - Where did you pick this up? - Pick? I bought it, of course. When? At the market. How come I didn't see you? You're irritating! You really are. I have nothing for you now. Wait a moment. It's not done yet, but I made it for you. It has a cross on it, for safety. It's my dream to have my own shop. Or supply stuff like this. You can be my model. Someone might discover you. Can I give it to you later? I'll just fix the lock really quick. You can wear it at the bar. You could attract more customers. Too quick. I'm not ready yet. Hello? Hello? No one's answering... Whose number is this? Hello? Hello? Luis? - Luis? - Maricar, it's Luis. Nico called up. He thought you were already here. I am gonna go home. I already told your parents. Your mom is very worried. Hello. Your father keeps coming back here. Asking if I got any word from you. Tell dad to wait. - Maricar, hello? - Okay, I will tell him. Who was that? Our neighbor. Sounds like a girlfriend. Stop pestering me! You're leaving? No. Well, not now. How about you? If you want, you can come with us. Us? Yes, with us. With my sister. Leave this place. Come with us. Cool shades, aren't they, Luis? Hey, Luis! Yeah, cool! It's too much, Luis. Your energy is too much. It's cool. No, I don't think so. No I didn't. Your brown-nosing worked again. No, I didn't. It doesn't suit you. Luis, come here check this one out. Try it on. I don't use it anymore. Thanks. This will fit just fine. We've got some more. Awesome! - Where have you been? - From Angel's Pad. You want to eat. - You wanna say something? - Huh? None. Thank you for the CD. I'll give you your money back. Don't worry about it. I remember at a contest. We didn't get to bring any CD. - Tell it straight to me. - You know... I'm not leaving this place. Lulu. I told you I'm not Lulu. You are Lulu! Even if you turn the world inside out, you are Lulu! And not here. This is not what you want. I'm happy here. Everything I want to do is here. I have nothing to go back for. Lulu. I send money. That's enough. At least I get to help, right? And at least, I... I know what I want. What I want to do for myself. Like what? To dance? In front of those old men? You believe they come here to hear your voice? Stop distracting me. Do whatever you want. But do it without hurting anyone. I'm not hurting anyone. Me! Do I look pleased seeing you with these foreigners? Lulu! If this bothers you, feel free to leave. Feel free to go home. But I never will. What for? To be hurt again? Beaten? Starved? Is that what you want for me? Lulu? That was the past. They have changed now. Before, they used to hurt us. Everyone can change. Lulu, everyone changes. Everyone changes. - Shanang! - Just a second. What's going on? Oh, my god! What happened? Bah! Jonas! Hurry! Who among them? Looks like the one who gave a CD to Rose? Someone's been beaten to death before by a fucking sadist. That's scary, Rose. Someone died in the same manner. He wasn't taken to the hospital, because Mrs. Kim might get busted. Stop tattling, you gossipmongers! How long should I tolerate this? - This is all so horrible! - Let's get out of here! Stop that! Get in. Open up, we wanna see! - Get in! Hurry! - Open up! Let us out of here! - Tighter. A little more. - Perfume? Breathe. Inhale. - Inhale! - Hey! Inhale. You're driving me nuts. There we go! Perfect! Let me see your bangs? Is everything all right? Divine, are you there already? Girl, you better get down there. Your brains are in curls already. Come on. Let's go. - Divine, wait up. - Hurry up! Reyna? Reyna? Reyna? Reyna? Rose! - How's Luis? - What are you doing here? - How's Luis? - You are performing tonight, aren't you? How is Luis? He hasn't woken up yet. What happened to him? Here. What is this? He must be brought to the hospital. Rose, you know we can't. Please, Reyna? It's all my fault. Rose, we can't. The only reason he's here is... He wants to take me home. Rose. Come on, Reyna. Please. Something might happen to him. Something might happen to my brother. Please, Reyna. Get back there. Please. I'll take care of him. Go now. Please. Luis? Luis? Anybody home? Anybody home? Go, Lulu! That's my sister right there! Go, Lulu. You can do it! - Rosie! - Rosie! What? The NBI? Wait, where are you anyway? Where is everyone? Why isn't anyone here? They are surrounding the area. I've got to leave. - Get the kids out now! - Yes. Luis? - Rosie! - Rosie! Let's all be quiet! Everyone, relax! Don't panic! All the girls, please move to the center. - Take care of this. - Sure. I'm not really into this. I was just doing a favor for my friend, please sir. - Ms. Kim! Come with us! Let's go. - What do you want? What happened to him? He was beaten up. He's been motionless the whole day. Can we bring him to the hospital? They're all very nice. They never abuse us or anything. They even feed us and let us live in a house. Sir, our friend! - Just a moment. - Stay here. Brother! - Brother! - Enough. We'll take care of it. Stop it. Just stay here. Whenever I remember my brother, I regain strength. He didn't fail me. Though he is gone now, I know he wants me to be happy. To be free. It wasn't easy to accept all these. But I need to move on, and be happy with my new life. I am going back to my family. Take care of my siblings. I will love them, Like how I was loved by my brother, Luis. - One more? - Stay there. - Nice car! - He must tip well. Hurry!
