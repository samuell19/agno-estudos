The judges have reached a decision. I request the Chief Guest to distribute the prizes. When the winner's name is announced... ...I request her to come forward and take the prize. The winner is... Reema Mathur! The runner-up is... ...Reema's own elder sister, Roma Mathur. I won't accept a second prize! It is the judges' decision! - It is incorrect. I should be the winner. Don't be stubborn. I'm not being stubborn. I win the contest every year. And my dress is better than hers. Take your prize. I have never been defeated and never will be. I will take this trophy and not the second prize! Reema, it's your turn now. Give me this for a minute. - Why? Give it to her. - I won't share my things. But I won the prize! What? You defeated me?! What nonsense is this? Teach your older daughter to accept defeat. ...and your younger one to win. Or they will always be at loggerheads. Give me a minute more... I've been hearing that for the past two hours. Go out and see if it's bright now or still cloudy. Why do you want to know that? Because if it's sunny, I'll wear this bright dress. I hope it's not sunny, or she'll take two more hours. First she'll change her dress, then her make-up. Then she will wear matching jewellery! It's not sunny. I think it will remain cloudy. Don't make any assumptions, Reema. Alright. Take your time. I'll take an auto. Are there any new books? - Yes. Are you Ravi Saxena? - So far I am. I have read a lot about you. Am I part of your course? - No. It was incredible! Guess whom I met! Ravi Saxena. - Who told you? The glow on your face says it all. You have been harping on the name for three months now. You are all praises for Ravi Saxena. In fact, I'm a little jealous of Ravi Saxena. How does he look? Well, what do I say? Greetings, Sir. - Greetings. You took a long time. - I apologise. Your exhibition seems to be a hit. It will be, when rich people like you spend money. Go ahead! I have to leave in half-an-hour. This is good. It's already sold out. - How do you know? There is a red dot marked on it. This is spectacular! It's sold. It's a strange coincidence! Who is this man who has similar tastes? It is a lady. - I see... Who is she? - There she is. Put a red dot on the painting she is intently looking at. I have bought it. - Won't you look at it? I don't need to. Her choice will be mine, too. I should buy this. - It's already sold. Not really, though there is a hitch. Madam wants to buy the painting you've bought. You may take it. You needn't worry now. Taking a second look, it doesn't seem so impressive. It's for you. She is right. The painting indeed isn't impressive. Didn't you buy this painting? - No. Then, I'll buy it. You should always buy what you like. ...and not what others like. Tell me something. - Yes. Do you always get what you like? I wonder if a red dot has been marked on her. Her name is Roma Mathur. She had given me her card when she came. Are you watching TV? - No, I am not watching TV. Then you'd better switch it on immediately. Why? - Gosh... The longer you continue talking to me, the more you'll be at a loss. All right. Who told you that business and romance do not mix? So, why is there no romance in your life? Because it is essential to have a girl in romance. Is there no girl in your life? I have met that girl only once. Tell our audience, who the fortunate girl is. It's too personal a matter. But if she's watching this programme... ...she will certainly know that I'm hinting at her. What if she isn't watching this programme? Then I will have to meet her personally. Did you watch my programme? I was hinting at you. Feeling shy won't do. I have told you what I feel. Don't you have anything to say? "What does my heart have to say to your heart?" "Listen to it..." "What punishment does it decree..." "Listen to it..." "What does my heart have to say to your heart..." "Listen to it..." "What punishment does it decree..." "Listen to it..." "It is the season of spring..." "Come near." "I lost my heart to you, the first time I met you." "I was lost in your thoughts, my love." "I feel like pouring my heart out today." "I want to say everything unsaid today" "...that what my gestures say..." "Come near..." "I want to make you a bride and adorn your tresses." "And love you to your heart's content." "Let a new world be created from our love." "With an abode of desire and a world of dreams." "And a path made of stars..." "Come near." Reema dear, what are you so engrossed in? I was watching Ravi Saxena's interview. You like Ravi so much? If that piece of paper is more delicious than this... ...then let me have little of it too. Should I apply some butter on it? To phone her or not, is what I was wondering? Don't wonder. Here's the phone. Go ahead! What happened? - It was a man's voice. Try again. Now what? - It was a woman this time. Atleast you know that animals don't answer calls there. Being a business tycoon... ...and calling a girl are two different things. When the person answers, then you should politely say... Could I speak to Roma? - She has gone out. Where has she gone? - To the auction at Dariya Mahal. I called up to remind her... ...about the auction at Dariya Mahal. She was admiring her beauty in the mirror. When she thought about me, she felt bashful. This isn't an ordinary mirror. It's a piece of history. Take a look at its expensive frame. Rs.3,000 - What? Just Rs.3,000? Just the historical dust on the frame is worth Rs.10,000. I'm only interested in this mirror. You may take away the historical dust for your own self. Rs.3,000. - Rs.3,001. Rs.4,000 - Rs.4,001. Rs.5,000 - Rs.5,001. Did I hear you say Rs.6,000? No. This piece of history is yours. Now, it's lot number five... Lady Curzon had imported these to Tibet from France. Rs.10,000 - Rs.10,001. Rs.15,000 - Rs.15,001. Rs.20,000 - Rs.20,001. He must be mad. Rs.30,000 - Rs.30,001. Madam, it is your turn now. These things of the Royal family are now yours. Enough of it now. Welcome! Have your breakfast. You purchased a lot yesterday. You will be impressed to know that I didn't buy a thing. You didn't buy anything? - No, I didn't. Then what is all this? Have your breakfast. Foolish girl! She gets all useless things. She spends my hard-earned money on this junk. We badly needed a tub. ...and an antique tub is the pride of a home. No. What we really needed was that commode. Antique commodes are very special. This is too much. You seem to have really liked my gift. Yes. People at home liked it more than I did. So now, it's important that I meet. Tomorrow evening at the Taj Coffee Shop. You look beautiful. - I am angry. Then I should say, you look beautiful when angry. Please be seated. Why are you after my life? What is it that you want? I love you. So, you've fallen in love with me in only 2 meetings? A single meeting suffices to fall in love. And we have met twice. But how did you decide... ...that I too have fallen in love with you? I am a businessman. I make a deal only when the opposite party is interested. If you weren't interested in me then you wouldn't be here. Don't you know of any other way to profess your love? Like? You could have sent me flowers. Or written a love-letter. You could have praised me and... - And...? Let me fulfill this wish of yours. "You live in my breath." "You live in my heartbeats." "You live in my thoughts." "Darling, you're wonderful." "There is so much to praise about you." "Your open locks of hair... ...are like a stream of fragrance in the atmosphere". "The gleaming flower buds... ...are like a festival of flowers in the garden." "Your veil fluttered in such a manner... ...that it made the mischievous breeze go bonkers about you." "You live in my promises." "You live in my memories." "You live in my desires." "The weather is so wet." "The clouds are feeling youthful." "You walk with such vigour..." "...that even the breeze changes its course." "Don't gaze at me like this." "I feel scared." "My heart begins to beat faster." How much sugar? - Two spoonfuls. I've brought something for you. Is it? But...? - But what? How can I take this ring? There's only one way to take the ring. The thing is... My name is Sunil Bhatnagar. I'm the photographer of 'Society' magazine. You have an interesting face. I was searching for a face like yours for the next cover page. Can I click some of your pictures? What do you feel about it? Let's go. - Yes. I managed to get a cover photograph. Do you know what Sunil said? He said... So what were you saying? I was saying that... I want to marry you. Marriage? I haven't even thought about marriage till date. Then think it over. - It's not just about thinking. I mean... about marriage... the family members... I will speak to your Daddy today itself. No, it's turned cold. I am Ravi Saxena. Good morning, sir. I want to discuss something personal. Certainly. Come to the office. I'd like to come home. - You are welcome. Will seven in the evening tomorrow be fine? Yes. I will be there. Just a minute... How wonderful! She is looking so pretty today! - Yes. Whom are we waiting for, decked up this way? If I say, we are waiting for happiness... ...then will you believe me? Welcome, Ravi. This is my brother, Vinay. Greetings. - Please come. This is my mother, my wife... ...and you already know Reema. Yes. She is very fond of dropping books. Please be seated. - Please... You should be seated too, Uncle. Reema, get us some tea. - Yes. You had said that you had something important to say. Go ahead. Elders ought to speak about such matters. But we have no elders in our home. So, I... So... So... So, I have been temporarily promoted. So, I will talk to you, right? - Yes, of course. Sir, I seek an alliance for my elder brother... with your elder daughter, Roma. Come, Roma, be seated. You never mentioned Ravi to us. I knew, you would really approve of Ravi. You haven't answered me. Nothing could make us happier. Mohini, get some sweets. - Of course. I'll go in. - No. I will. Reema, dear. I am sorry, dear. Did you hear? - Yes. Mr. Mathur, I have a request to make. Get them married quickly... So, that I can follow suit! Yes. But there will be an engagement first. I knew it. So, we have come fully prepared. Let's start with it. Congratulations! The sweets... Mother. You should also eat it. You recognise Sunil, don't you? You had photographed Roma at the restaurant, right? Yes. Shake hands with Sunil once more. He has printed my photo on the cover of "Society". The photograph is good. It has to be good. It is my photograph. Sunil wants to talk to you about it. - Go ahead. Roma's photograph has created a sensation in the ad. World. My phone has been constantly ringing the whole day. There was not a minute's rest from the phone. So, I thought... - Just a second. Roma should take up modelling, right? So you want my opinion? I don't want you to take up modelling. Why not? I gave my opinion, since you asked for it. It's your wish. But there should be a reason behind your opinion. I have given my opinion, Roma. I will not model. Stop here. How much is it? My friend met with an accident. I went to the hospital. What a bomb! She's the 'society' girl. - Let go of her. Let me warm my hands. What's wrong? Then stop staring. - I'm staring at her, not you. Do I have to pay to stare at her? Don't show off, bloody pimp! What were you saying? Sit in the car. I can't believe, I can fight on the streets. Do you realise now, why I don't want you to model? If I had come on time, then all this... I made you wait for long. I'll make amends and wait for you tomorrow. I'll reach an hour before time. We will then go for the movie. I hate to wait and to make others wait. Be ready tomorrow. I'll pick you up. Grandma... - Yes? Is my face really that bad? Is moon looked upon as ugly? You are saying this only to console me. Dear, you've a moon within your heart too! Tell me... which rascal told you that you are ugly? My mirror tells me so. Then throw such a mirror. If you don't believe me, ask your husband after you're married. Greetings, Grandma. - Bless you. Bless you. Sit down. - Thanks, I've come to take Roma. I hope she's ready. - She must be ready by now. Isn't Mr. Bhalla an ace film producer? I won't let you sign with an ordinary producer. Do you know what his reaction was when he saw your pictures? He was floored. He said that he'd call me at around five... I've been waiting for his call. I hope, you aren't going out. Out...? No. I wasn't going out. This is not the time to go out. I'll call you back as soon as he rings me up. What's wrong? Reema, I have a splitting headache. Ravi must be on his way. Make him understand. I've got a terrible pain... You can do the explaining now. I was waiting for you, all dressed up... ...when I suddenly got a headache. We can't miss the movie today. Have some tablets. Everything'II be fine. I don't take tablets unnecessarily. A couple of hours of sleep will do me good. Please leave me alone for a while. You take rest. I'll go for the film with Reema. No. I won't come. Come on... - Not me... You look terrible when you're angry. Shall we go for the movie? No. Let's return home. No. We won't return. - Then? I'll tell you. So, this is the honeymoon cottage you were telling me about. It is a beautiful place. Whenever I'm worried or depressed... ...I come here. So, one has to be depressed or worried to come here? Let me show you the room which I've made for Roma. Wow! You know my sister's choice too well. What a gift to think about! What will be your wedding gift to Roma? Me? Gift her with a little of your understanding and tolerance... ...and the ability to forgive. We will need these qualities after marriage. As per your wishes, if I do gift sister with them... ...what will you give me in return? Whatever you wish. - Then let's go home. Patch-up with sister. You're welcome. But you were supposed to come tomorrow! All right, I'll go away. I'll come tomorrow. Be seated. How about breakfast? - No, thank you. Only coffee. Here it is. Two tea spoonfuls. I knew. I was teasing Ravi deliberately. Your parcel, Sir. What is it, Ravi? This is for you. Take it. What does it contain? - A saree for Reema. A saree for Reema? And nothing for me? How can it be? This is for you. Why didn't you give me my present first? I was only teasing you. It's very pretty. - I will take that saree. But, sister, green is Ravi's favourite colour! Maybe. But it doesn't suit me. I will take that one only. All right. You may take this one. You have become the son-in-law of this family now. It's your duty to find a good suitor for Reema. Grandma, why do you have to insist on a good suitor? For Reema, even some ordinary suitor would do. Did you have to say this? You made her weep. I was only joking. Moreover, Reema has got used to weeping. I'll be back. You are weeping? No. I am not weeping. Is this the same Reema who used to make me understand that... ...your sister is a nice girl, she speaks ill sometimes. And that she doesn't keep anything at heart? What's happened today? Today you have felt hurt at your sister's statement? I am asking for pardon on your sister's behalf. Forgive her. Roma is such a lucky girl. - Why? When I get angry at her, you make me understand. And when you get angry at her, I make you understand. In this way, she escapes scotfree. Tell me something... If we get angry at each other, who will make us understand? But why would we become angry at each other? If such a thing happens, I would be the loser. I'm normal now. - After all, what are friends for? I needed a friend yesterday. Today, you're needing one. Congratulations. - Why? Bhalla has signed you as the heroine of his next film. What! - And do you know... The film's shooting will start from the 9th, i.e. next week. The 9th? Yes and then a month's outdoor shooting. Why are you quiet? You should be ecstatic! I am getting married on the 9th. Why did you do all this if you were getting married? Married women have no place in films. And this is an opportunity of a lifetime. What do I... You can opt for marriage or films. The choice is yours. I am very scared. - That I'll defeat you? No. How can you defeat me? - Then? Everything is happing so quickly. I got engaged yesterday. I'll be married the day after tomorrow. You will be getting married after a month. Your turn first. But there should be time to think, too. You're amazing! Everything is happening according to your wishes. And everything will continue to happen likewise. Everything seems so monotonous. I mean, it will be the same music... ...the same nuptial pyre, the priest... ...the same 1,000-year old customs and traditions. Sometimes, these boring things can be interesting. And you love Ravi. That's fine. I have reached a dead-end now. And I haven't been born to be only Mrs. Ravi Saxena. Why else were you born? I didn't get time to think about that either. That's wrong! The knight doesn't move in that direction. Keep this aside! Chess is boring. And it isn't necessary... ...that the knight should follow a set pattern. "The procession of the groom will arrive..." "So play the drum." "I will dance all night long." "So, beat the drums!" "You will go to your beloved's home..." "We will miss you." "Don't forget us, once you go to your dear one's home." "Why do the eyes of a father fill with tears?" "A daughter has to leave home some day..." "She will remain with her loved one now." "So, play the drums." "Flowers bloom in your heart, with your cheeks flushed pink." "A trinket shines on your forehead, kohl adorns your eyes." "Bedecked are you, with jewels so many." "O Sister, you look so beautiful." "With lips so red..." "And earrings hanging from your ears." "Filled are the bride's hands with henna." "So, beat the drums." "Let all your troubles be mine, and my happiness be yours." "I pray to God, to keep you happy forever." "May none of your desires be unfulfilled." "May all your wishes come true." "I wanted to say what I wanted to say." Your bridal dress is here. You will have to go around the sacred fire in this. Be quick. You are still here? This is all due to my follies. I had always defended her misdeeds. I have to bear the consequences today. It's no use crying over spilt milk. She has brought us disgrace and gone away. "Don't get angry on reading this letter." "Instead, try to understand why I did it." "I have got an offer of a lead role in a film." "Opportunity knocks only once." "Marriage can wait." "We can get married after some days" "I'll return after the shooting is over" "...and we'll get married the next day" "I know you love me a lot and will wait for me." "Yours, Roma." I will go down and tell the people with folded hands... ...that my useless daughter has run away. The procession can return. - Wait. The procession will not return. Roma will never return here after this incident. She cannot return to me either. I won't marry her. If you give me the permission and if she's willing... ...then I want to marry Reema. No! Reema will refuse. - If she does that... ...then I'll take the procession back. But I... Will you listen to me without asking any questions? Marry me... "You will go to your beloved's home..." "We will miss you." "Don't forget us, once you go to your dear one's home." "Why do the eyes of a father fill with tears?" "A daughter has to leave home some day..." "She will remain with her loved one now." Looking at you in these clothes I feel... ...I have been unfair to you. I don't want to make you unhappy. But... what do I do? I have always worn clothes which sister discarded. But I can't shoulder the burden of the bridal dress. I understand your plight. And I know, you can understand my plight. Darkness engulfed me when I read the letter... You were the only ray of hope for me. You saved my life. And a saviour is considered to be great. A person who can forgive is also considered to be great. Then why couldn't you forgive sister and wait for her? I have forgiven her. I hold no grudge against her. But why should I have waited? You loved each other. Yet, in no time... ...that love became a thing of the past. What will happen to a marriage that took place so fast? I have immense faith in you. You should also reciprocate that faith. Or we would not have got married today. And you would not have had a 'mangalsutra' around your neck. Will you listen to me, without asking any questions? In our marital relationship... ...as long as Roma remains a barrier... ...we will be only good friends. Marriage is a union of two hearts and then of bodies. My sister is not present here... But her shadow's omnipresent... You may be right, Reema. I need a friend more than a wife right now. The day... ...you consider me to be more than a friend... ...extend your hand to me on that day. I'll wait for that day. Can I take a book? Of course! Bring the book here. Do read it. It's a very good book. I didn't know you had such long and lovely hair. How would you know? She applies a lot of oil and hides them. Do you know, what Bahadur said? He said, that if there was no oil for frying, then... ...you could use the oil in her hair for the purpose! Now, comb your hair properly. It's your first day in office. Don't go fooling around. It's time for my brother to fool around. Let your hair loose for a while. Then watch him get poetic. He will be inspired and recite poem after poem. Go and have your bath. We'll talk later. I like you with your hair left open. You should be in the Guiness Book. Why? - Because... you must be the first beautiful woman who is hell bent on looking ugly! You take so much care decorating your house. Take that much care of yourself too. You don't look a newly-married bride in these clothes. Wear beautiful sarees... And kindly don't hide those lovely eyes... ...behind these spectacles. To enhance your beauty, wear jewellery too... Wear earrings, a nose-ring... ...a necklace and have a bunch of keys hanging around from your waist. Put anklets on your feet. And wear bangles, too. Your love will be smitten by you. Vinay is your responsibility henceforth. Be seated. What is the problem? - Your suspicions were true. Mr. Rastogi has joined Bombay Textiles. He didn't give me a month's notice, but only his resignation. Give him a month's salary and a cheque of Rs.50,000. Because we were saved the ordeal of dismissing him. The 5 O'Clock... - There is a meeting. All right, then. Why are you smiling? - For no reason. In business, you are blessed with a vision of keen acumen. If you exhibited a little of these in your personal life... ...then it would be good. Go and work. This painting is beautiful. When did you come? When you were about to fall. I'll get some tea. Leave me. On one condition. Promise me that you will stand on the stool... ...and fall once again. I am creating a disturbance in your romantic scene. It's your mother's call. Attend to it. - But put me down first. You never picked me up in your arms. Is it? - Shall I come? You're a rascal, really! Yes, Mother. I remember it's your birthday tomorrow. Just a minute. I will ask and tell you. We will surely go. - We will be coming. How are you, dear? - I am very fine. You were always fine. But I hope you are happy. If she weren't happy, she wouldn't be glowing like this. She's looking beautiful. I hope nobody casts an evil eye on her. Come, Ravi. Be seated. She will surely be eyed. But by my brother. After all, he always keeps looking at her round the clock. Ever since she has come, my demand has diminished. You should be the focus of attention now, since you can get married. Tell me something... Are you really Reema's mother or her elder sister? What did you say? - In fact... ...I was praising Uncle's choice. You've flattered Aunty a lot. Now you should eat something now. Of course I will eat. I'm flattering Aunty so that she finds a good girl for me too. So that I would also be to hold the girl's hand. What say, brother? Right? - You are right. You should find a girl for him. I have plenty of girlfriends at the college. But they are not suitable for marriage. Many college girls are crazy about him. Do you remember, brother... Dear, why are you eating with your left hand? Why are eating with your left hand? Eat with your right hand. It so happened that she forgot to bring her right hand from home. What say? It doesn't matter. Such things happen after one gets married. What is it? - Sew this button I'll get it. Will you come out with me this evening? Yes. I hope, you won't be scared to come alone. I'll pick you up in the evening. What're you thinking? I feel, this is all a dream. It is a dream. It is a dream come true. May I say something? You had once said... ...that the day I consider you to be more than a friend... ...I should extend my hand to you. "O maiden so fair, take my heart away." "O my beloved, take my sleep away." "You have made me restless." "You too have taken away my peace." "The sound of you walking makes my bangles jingle..." "In my dreams all night, your trinket shines so bright." "All I ask of God is you, my love." "I have been restless for so long." "You are my world." "Why do you lower your kohl-filled eyes and blush?" "Whenever at me you gaze, a glow appears on my face." "My heart yearns for you." "Your love is everywhere." "We will be together in life and in death." "May this bond of love never break." "Seasons may come and go, but you, I will never let go." "Be a song on my lips." "Come into my arms, my love." "Hold me in your arms forever and ever." Happy? Wonderful! What a perfect match! An unfaithful lover... ...and a sister who betrayed me. One had promised to be my life-partner. And the other was a witness to all those promises. You have set an example in infidelity and betrayal. Sister, please... Stop calling me your sister! You did a noble deed by protecting your parents' dignity. You must have been praised for it. Your drama has ended! What is your status? A mere substitute of a wife! Don't you dare say anything about my wife! Wife? Do you call a woman you used... ...to take revenge on me, as your wife? I thought, you'd be ashamed to even show your face. How dare you come here! You are the betrayer and you are the infidel. You ran away from the wedding altar. And you have the audacity to accuse us! Anyway, why should I have waited for you? I am tolerating your nonsense for Reema's sake, or... Or what will you do? Kill me? That would have been a better way to seek revenge. You have stabbed me in the back by marrying Reema. You can remove me from your heart and from your house. But how can you do away with the guilt in your conscience? ...that you wronged me? But the two of you can't build your love on my tears. Because I will never let you be happy. She swallowed a whole bottle of sleeping pills. See what this foolish girl has done! Isn't father here? Roma had come home, but your father turned her away. She called at 4, saying she was going. Then... There is no need to worry. She has regained consciousness. You may take her home in a couple of days. But remember, she is mentally disturbed. Such patients could keep showing suicidal tendencies. So don't leave her alone and try to keep her happy. The patient wants to see Mrs.Reema. What have you done and why? Why are you crying? I should be the one crying. I spoke very rudely, the other day. I have hurt everyone. But the only thing I know is to hurt others. I thought of killing myself, but the attempt was futile. Enough! One doesn't kill oneself... ...because of what happens in the heat of the moment. I have already forgotten everything you had said. But I haven't forgotten it. Till you forgive me, I will not be able to forget a thing. It's not advisable for the patient to talk too much. I'll come again tomorrow. I want to say something. Yes? Father will not keep sister at home. So? Where will she go all alone? - What are you implying? Can we keep her at our place? This is your home... You can do as you please. If you think it is right, I have no objection. Why are you standing outside? Come in. I feel as if I had come home. These flowers are beautiful. - I knew you'd like them. Who can know my likes and dislikes better than you do? Come... be seated. Rest here. I'll get some juice for you. No. Sit with me. Here... Ravi must have disapproved of me coming here? No. He himself wanted you to come here. After what I did to him... he must be... Forget the past... Even I want to forget it. Because it is not worth remembering... ...that I ruined my own life... I am my biggest Enemy. I pursued a shadow... ...and the sun set on it. ...putting an end to the shadow. Do you know what happened to the film? For which I had left everything? After shooting for 15 days... ...the producer threw me out of the film. He signed a renowned actress instead. You start living life afresh. You'll forget all this as if it were a terrible nightmare. Is Roma staying at Reema's as house? What could I do, Grandma? I was awaiting your return. Your son is not willing to hear the mention of Roma's name. It was nice that Reema and Ravi took her with them. Have you gone mad? She will ruin Reema's marital happiness. Why are you in the study at this time of the night? Why are you still awake? That is not an answer to my question. Actually, I wanted to apologise for misbehaving the other night. Where is the need to apologise? There is a need. I have hurt you deeply... You may have, but I have no hard feelings now. I know that you still love me. You are under the wrong impression. I feel nothing for you now. I feel no love, or hatred or anger. It is a nice way to console your heart. If I haven't said the truth... ...then this pillow would not have been here. I'll prepare the tea today. - No. I will... You relax. I'll get some exercise, too. How much of sugar, Vinay? - Two-and-a-half spoons. And you, Reema? - One spoon. Here... Ravi, two spoons for you, right? I remember... That was in the past. Now I take only one spoon. My tastes have changed. Reema, make the tea for me. Come, sister. I wanted to talk to you. - Yes? I am a bit worried. - Why? I hope there is no tension between Ravi and you... because of me? - Why do you think so? Then why does he sleep in the study instead of the bedroom? It was my decision. The circumstances under which we got married... ...were difficult to fully accept. You did the right thing, Reema. It would have been the most humiliating thing... ...if Ravi married you out of anger and compulsion. In your place, I would never have picked up such left-overs! Anyway, what had to happen has happened. The two of you can't continue to live like this. I mean... if, by my going away... ...this distance can be made up for... What are you saying? Where will you go now? I haven't got my things here. May I borrow your sari? Certainly. Pick any one you like. Which do you like? But you don't like this sari. That was in the past. My tastes have changed. Be seated, sister. This is your favourite colour, isn't it, Ravi? How do I look? You were right. This colour doesn't suit you at all. This colour suits more on Reema. Where are you going? - Sister didn't eat food. Be seated. She's not a kid. She will eat if she feels hungry. You heard me. - But you don't understand... Which magazine have you brought today? I got an offer of a film for Roma and not a magazine. But Roma has declined it. You've refused? I won't act because you don't like it. Leave my choice aside. The country needs good actresses. Mr. Sunil, ask her to do the role. When she can act so beautifully at home... ...she will surely create a sensation on the screen. What is it that you want? What's wrong? You don't waste an opportunity to put me down. Why? What's the reason for that? I'm even willing to change myself to please you... As I 'had' pleased. For how long and how much will you lie to yourself? I know that you can't live without me. And listen to something now. I can't live without you either. Get one thing clear. You are only Reema's elder sister to me. And you have no place in my heart. - Nobody can take my place. Aren't you ashamed to speak... ...to your younger sister's husband in this manner? Don't talk about these middle-class values to me. I am not Reema. I'm Roma! Love is stronger than all these farcical relationships. You know it too well... ...that you didn't get me and so married Reema. To keep your male ego intact. You can get married any number of times... ...but you will aways love me. Did you hear that? You will always love me.. ...because you have always loved me. Please forgive me. We will start our lives afresh. Divorce Reema... Enough! Get out before I say something nasty... Wait! Don't open the door. Don't reject me. I can't bear that. Why don't you understand? I can't live without you. Look... look... Take me in your arms and embrace me. I love you very much! Don't leave me. I can't bear it. Embrace me... Don't force me to call the security guards... It'll be better if you leave! You are crazy! How did you like this style of committing suicide? I have something important to say. Isn't she the same girl who tried to kill herself... ...by swallowing some pills? - Yes. I have her report. Yes... and no! Please come. Why are you so late? What happened to her? - It was a minor accident. I took her to the doctor. - Let me... No. I'll take her. "You live in my breath." "You live in my heartbeats." "You live in my thoughts." "This night is fortunate that..." "...it is sleeping with its moon in close embrace." "Here, on a bed of sorrow..." "...my desires are sobbing in solitude." "Friend, I lost you after winning you over." "What to say of my fortune?" "I have been distanced from you." "Only your memories are close to me." "You live in my love." "You live in my speeches." "You live in my wishes." "My nights seem so long." "My days seem so long." "My dreams are unfulfilled." "My life is unfulfilled without you." "Envelop me in your dreams." "Envelop me in your eyes." "Envelop me in your embrace." No, Roma, this is not right. Has Roma had her breakfast? - No. She's not in the mood. 5 kilograms of rice. Don't listen to what he says. Order everything extra. I think your sister has become a permanent member here. What nonsense is this? I was only joking. - It was a cruel joke. Apologise to her. Didn't you hear me? I heard. Let him go. He must not have meant anything bad. I apologise on behalf of Vinay. Alright. Let's go. Shall I come to leave you at the airport in the morning? There's no need. I'm only going to Delhi. I'm taking the suitcase now. As I may disturb you in the morning. Check-mate. You can never defeat me. Just a minute. Now I know how to protect my King. This is called check-and-mate. You've defeated me for the first time. - I have learnt from my mistakes. I won't get defeated now. One minute... Where is Reema? - She is sleeping. Tell her I'll be back home at 10.30 tomorrow. Whose phone was it? It was Sunil. Are you going to the bazaar tomorrow? - Yes. At ten O'clock. I'll give you a list of the things I want. Please get them for me. I want to talk to you about Roma. Who's Roma? - Don't you want to know... ...how and where she is? I think it's been quite some days since she died. Where's Madam? - She's gone to the bazaar. I'm in my room. Make a cup of tea for me. The shower in my bathroom wasn't working. So, I came here. Why are you angry? You didn't inform me about coming here. I had called. Didn't Roma tell you? Listen, Roma... You knew Ravi would return at this time, right? No. Oh, yes! I forgot to tell you. He had called up last night. What's wrong with me these days? Why is Roma living with us a problem to you? It will be a problem for 'you' pretty soon. Why are you interfering in matters not concerning you? How long will you stay in your sister's house? Come home and apologise to father. Me? Apologise? Never! ...not in this life, at least! In any case, I can't stay in that house now. What are you saying, dear? - Please stay here, granny. No. How can I live in your husband's place? Anyway, my staying here is not going to help matters. But listen to one thing carefully. Ravi is your husband. And not some trophy you've won... ...which Roma can snatch and which you can give. Dear, hold the reins of your home tightly. But... - No, dear. This is your battle and you will have to fight it alone. Please, stop displaying your hysterics. I admit... ...that you can get anything from anyone you want... ...you can conquer the world if you want to. But leave Ravi for me. Because Ravi means the world to me. Don't make your world so small. To be after a man who is beyond your reach... ...is foolishness. Stop this madness. Wear your spectacles and look around... You will find a world beyond Ravi. But this is my world. ...Ravi and this home. Only an Indian wife can know this. You can't. You didn't go around the sacred fire or apply the vermillion. ...Or wear a 'mangalsutra' around your neck. By draping a towel, you can't compare yourself with me. You're used to my left-over things. You dare to compare yourself with me now! Forget all the marital rites and throw away this 'mangalsutra'. Your 'Indian' husband also wants that. It's not so easy to separate this from a married woman. It is easy. You wear this 'mangalsutra' because of me. ...let me throw it away! Your love didn't have the strength even then... ...or this 'mangulsutra' would not have been around my neck. And your love lacks the strength even now... ...to break this sacred bond! You have no idea about its strength. Distribute the rest. Is this any way to wish him on his birthday? Someone who is most near and dear and loved... ...should be wished this way. Should we have a party for your birthday in the evening? No. I want to give Ravi a fiesta today. Will you come out with me in the evening? We'll go out in the evening. You won't come. Only Ravi and I will go. You will come, won't you? You won't get scared to come alone with me? Fear? No. Why should someone who is most near and dear be feared? My brother is blushing, as if he had a date with you. We will go out in the evening... only the two of us. Where do you want to go? - Anywhere. Congratulations! You looked so surprised as if you were unaware that it is your birthday. I was not aware of this party. Did you...? - Didn't Roma tell you? Where is she? Celebrate the party. We're going out. We will join you later. Let's go. - Yes. "My face is like a mirror." "Look at your reflection in it." "Lift your eyelids, my love" "...and see your fate." "I will reveal my beauty to the world." "In the wonderful game of love, I shall win some day." "The beautiful dream you had once dreamt." "Stands there in reality in front of you." "A man cannot be like a mirror." "Time knows no restrictions." "The life of a lie lasts..." "...only till such time as truth surfaces." "The bond of love will never break, I promise." "None will share your love other than me." "The bond that is the union of body and soul." "Look at the chain that binds us together." "No secrets are withheld" "I know a mirror speaks nothing but the truth." "But mirrors often break." "Into small fragments are they shattered..." "My love, my dear, at his juncture, you're here" "...because of your dreams." What are you doing? - Packing your suitcase. I think you like my room a lot. Are you going to shift me to your room? I am going to shift you from this house. Good! I am glad to see my younger sister grow up. I won't become a 'big' shameless woman like you. I am ashamed to call you my elder sister. Then call me your husband's mistress. I'll cut your tongue off if you say that again! You have taken my place and even started talking like me. You are the ideal, sacrificing, Indian woman. Then, what are you doing in this new disguise? An ideal Indian woman will sacrifice anything... ...for her husband's well-being. And can take any form to save her husband from damnation. Before accusing me... ...learn to make your home a happy place. Are you exercising your authority on the house... ...of a man whose bed you could not share? No! I'm exercising authority on the house... ...of a man who places me in his heart. You will find many beds to share outside. Reema won't get slapped and accept defeat today. I have always been the dutiful younger sister... But you always considered that to be your victory. I should not accept defeat. And Ravi has made me realise this. If only my parents had me realise it... ...then I would have been Ravi's first love. Reema, don't fool yourself. I am Ravi's first and last love. You mean nothing to him. And if you don't believe me then ask Ravi. ...what I mean to him. What does she mean to you? I got your answer. I can't live here any longer. - No, Reema. This is your house and will remain so. You won't leave. The two of us will. Let's go. Wait, Ravi. I want to tell you something. But it's too late now. "Let all your troubles be mine." "May my happiness be yours." "All I pray to God..." "...is for your happiness." "May none of your desires be unfulfilled." "May all your wishes come true." "I have said what I wanted to say." I am very happy today. I knew, I'd win you someday. True love always wins. If you hadn't accepted me in front of Reema, then I would have killed myself. You have proved it twice that you can die for me. I will also die for you now. Drive slowly, Ravi. What have you done? Why are you driving so fast? Please drive slowly! We have passed my home. Stop the car! I'm scared! What are you doing? Look ahead! See where we're going! Stop the car! What are you doing? Leave my hand! Leave my hand! Leave me! Have you gone crazy? Leave my hand! I don't want to die! Leave my hand! I don't want to die! You can die alone, if you wish. Did you hear me? Leave my hand. Stop the car! I knew you'd never leave me alone. And I knew you'd leave me alone and escape. To commit suicide is a crime. What about committing suicide as a gimmick? So, this was all a gimmick? - Yes, it was. To prove that you never wanted to kill yourself for me. Are you saying this? - No! The doctor said it. His report says that you had only 2 or 3 sleeping pills. Then you slashed your wrists in front me. You knew nobody could have saved you if you were alone. I did all this to get your love. You don't love me. By having me, you wanted to defeat Reema again. And I didn't want to see Reema defeated again. So, I pretended to be in love with you... ...to see how much you could stoop. The Roma whom I had truly loved... ...has been long dead. The one before me now is a selfish, self-centred and arrogant Roma... ...whom I immensely hate. - Then go back to Reema! ...who isn't selfish, arrogant or beautiful like me... Beautiful? You can see many of your flaws in this mirror... Look deep into yourself. You will see a very ugly woman. And you call yourself beautiful? You ran away from the marriage altar. You couldn't be my wife... ...and you call yourself beautiful? You put your parent's honour at stake. You couldn't be a... ...dutiful daughter and you call yourself beautiful? You want to ruin the happiness of your sister who sheltered you... You couldn't be a good sister. And you call yourself beautiful? You are a narcissist. You can't give others happiness, but you can only steal it. You are a disgrace to the race of womanhood. And you call yourself beautiful? Beauty is not what is reflected in the mirror. ...Beauty is what is invisible in the mirror. I saw such beauty in Reema. I love her from the bottom of my heart. Today, Reema has proved how much she loves me. These shattered pieces of the mirror are your life. Maybe you will realise your mistakes when they prick you. Do you think you've defeated me? No, sister. - Do you think... ...you've stolen Ravi from me? - No. Do you think that Ravi loves you now? No. You think you're more beautiful and intelligent than I am? No. Then, what is it about you... ...that has made Ravi fall in love with you and not me? Why are you so good? Why am I not like you? I've been defeated! I've been defeated! Forgive me. Forgive me, Reema. No, sister. Shall I tell you something? You look terrible when you cry. Ravi, I... Will you listen to me without asking any questions? I love you very much. I love you from the bottom of my heart. "To you I could give every happiness." "Your happiness, I seek from God." "May none of your desires remain unfulfilled..." "may every wish of yours be fulfilled." "I have told you what's in my heart..." "The bridegroom shall arrive for our bride..." "beat the drums." "O maiden so fair, take my heart away." "O my beloved, take my sleep away"
