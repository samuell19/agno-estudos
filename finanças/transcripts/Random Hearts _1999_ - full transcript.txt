555-01-36. In case you check in, I'm heading for the airport early. Meet me for coffee. They're gonna mark you tardy. I've got court today. You working late? I can if you are. Thought I'd take you to The Palm. I wanna get my dad one of those weather radios. The nothing but weather ones? Now that he's on the water. Get him a book. Let him dope it out for himself. He'd like that. You'd like that. He doesn't think the weatherman's gonna lie to him. He wants to know if a hurricane's coming. What's wrong with The Palm? It's Friday night. It'll be crowded. You like it crowded. Okay, let's go to The Palm. If you're just killing time... Help. Did he talk about God? Ask him if God said anything bad. If we get him to say God speaks to him, then... That thing's cordless. What else did he say? Oh, baloney. Tru, she's on the phone. She'll be right down. What does he know about the democratic process? I got to go. Got any cash? Sure. I need about a half a million. Harold Cornelius is gonna run against me as a write-in. He's a nutcase. With a chain of drugstores and a lot of money. - Where are you going? - New York. New Hampshire won't stand for him buying a seat in Congress. This guy is Elmer Fudd. Yeah, sure. Jessie's birthday's Wednesday. I said we'd both be home. Sure. Attention all aircraft. Convective Sigma 3 Echo in effect for Washington-Baltimore area. A line of thunderstorms approximately 60 miles wide... moving from 260 degrees at 15 knots with tops to flight level 350. Wind gusts to 60 knots and possible cloud-to-cloud lightning. Visibility occasionally one mile... I said I wouldn't take PAC money. - That's when we didn't need it. - What do I say now? Do you swear to tell the truth, so help you God? I do. Name and occupation for the jury, please. William Van Den Broeck. I'm a Sergeant in Internal Affairs... Division of the District of Columbia Police Department. And what's your job, Sergeant? Internal Affairs is responsible for investigating incidents or allegations of misconduct... involving sworn officers and civilian employees of the District of Columbia. Plane to Miami now boarding at gate 33. Does he think we'll let him get away with that? Depose Henry. Sure. I'll see you. Sergeant... Van Den Broeck... you had to take a test to make Sergeant, didn't you? It was a written exam. If I put into evidence records that show... 56 officers took the test same time as you... and you did better than 54 of them, would that be about right? - We could look it up. - The point is... you're a smart guy. Number two on the written, 11 years a Sergeant. How come you're not a Lieutenant? Where are we going with this? Is it because you're white? Get out. She cannot do that. Your Honour. From 11 News, this is a special report. May I help you? I'm looking for a gift for my wife. Is there a radio just for weather? It's for my father-in-law in Florida. I got a couple back here. I'll show you. From a Southern Airline spokesperson... a normal crew is two pilots and three cabin attendants. The aircraft involved was a 737... which normally is configured for seats for 96 to 138 passengers. - Where's this? - Down in the Bay. National Safety Board officials were en route to the site... over Chesapeake Bay, 20 miles south... of the city limits, where Southern Airlines flight... 437 to Miami went down about an hour ago... with 103 passengers... Anything happening? School cops at King took a nine out of this girl's locker. Same gun got logged into evidence six weeks ago. Drive-by weapon. At an altitude of reportedly 8,000 feet when it veered off-course and began a steep descent... The only thing he isn't short on is cash. He'll buy a million dollars worth of TV time... and hide behind the best advertising money can buy. I can beat him if I can get on television myself. The issue here is whether someone totally unsuited for public office... can buy his way into the United States Congress. I hope your answer's no. I said "buy" too many times, right? Let's eat. You got no lunchroom here? Here's what we got. We got a gun that was used in a homicide and killed someone. Then it got stolen out of the property room. Maybe some cop sold it right out. Then we got you in possession of that gun. We ain't got no lunchroom. Some school fool say he found some gun in my locker. I wouldn't know. I wasn't there. I ain't possessing nothing. How did it get in your locker, Shyla? Don't use my Christian name like we gonna be friends. It's my impression you weren't in the market for corporate support. I hate making these calls. I thought I wouldn't have to. But now I need the money. We had a good relationship with your father. He understood the communications business. We appreciated that. Who's doing your media? I guess I was. Never needed much till Cornelius came out of left field. Make that right field. What do you think of Carl Broman? Offshore breeze and clearing this afternoon. Low tonight in the mid-70s. So? Juvenile's got her brother for knocking over gas stations. I guess she's holding for him... but she won't talk to us. We can get her a week in detention. Oh, yeah? How? I'll lose her paperwork. You'd do that? Hold her without a charge? For a week? Sure. If she wants to go home, maybe we get a name. Dutch, line three. Van Den Broeck. Clayton and George Beaufort? Well, Friday's payday, I guess. Stick with them until Alcee and I catch up with you. I want this son of a bitch. Alcee, we're on the roll. Janice... I didn't do anything. We were just talking. Don't even think that way. Shit like that makes people hate cops. Grab a radio. Cassie? You got a car for me? Not the pimpmobile. It's surveillance, not narcotics. This is it. Your wife called when you were in court. Things came up at work. She can't eat with you. Call before you go home. The tail section of the Southern Airliner is sticking out of the water. You can hear choppers above me. News choppers are getting a better look. Search and rescue operations... about an hour ago, with a reported 103 passengers on board... That aeroplane, a 12-year-old 737... There's Clayton. What the hell's he doing? - What's this clown doing? - I don't know. And where's George? Wait a minute. Get Elton and Tommy back here quick. Tommy, we need you guys back here. Something's going down. Clayton? How you doing? What's going on? Where's George, your partner? In the basement. The basement? What's he doing in the basement? A guy named Marvin is pouring booze without a licence. We're getting ready to write him. He comes up with a shotgun. He says he wants money. He tells me to go get it. He's got George down there. Somebody's holding George Beaufort hostage. Can he send us an ear? What's the plan, officer? We could call the police. Is that what you're getting ready to do? Call the police? There's a lot here already. He's got a gun on George. We got to do something. Oh, no. See, we're Internal Affairs. You got a policeman that screws up. You got a policeman that abuses his position, steals. That's us. What do you think is going on here? You think we just happened by? We've been on you all day. All week. We've been on you all month. You know what I think's going on? Somebody got sick and tired of paying you off. You wanna corroborate that, gives us a reason... to drag George's sorry ass out of the basement. Otherwise, we'll talk to the guy with the shotgun, see what his version is. You're asking me to turn George in? Just push me and push me... Marvin? Marvin? Marvin? I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck. Hello, asshole. You're under arrest. Who is the real Kay Chandler? What's she stand for? Do you know? What's she doing in Congress anyway? Harold Cornelius for Congress. Shirley Magnuson did it. - Pretty good. - You think so? She knows you're running as Arthur Spencer's daughter. She can't go after him. He's dead. And when he wasn't, he got a lot of votes. All she does is ask a couple of questions. And the subtext is: She only got elected because of her daddy. She didn't earn it. This is America, and that ain't fair. I'm not running as Arthur Spencer's daughter. What will you run as? Nice person? I have my own record. City attorney? National committeewoman? A record's when somebody who votes remembers what you did for them. I beat Harvey Galin five to three. My, my. Five to three. How'd those three vote Democratic in a district that hadn't... voted for a Democrat since Roosevelt? They're trying to send you a message. This won't be a nice election. Folks talking about the amber waves of grain. This is about the man with the money against the woman with the name. Can't beat you on your record. You haven't got one. He won't beat you on the issues. On the issues, I'll kick his ass. The real question is: Can you beat Shirley Magnuson? I'm not running against Shirley Magnuson. Whatever you don't want to see in the papers... whatever you and your husband haven't told each other, Shirley will find it. Shirley's wasting her time. How's your marriage? Swell. How's yours? If I was running for office, I'd be in trouble. You fool around, Mrs Chandler? A little slap and tickle? Any special friends? Not at the moment, but I'll keep you posted. What's the worst thing you've done? You need a life, Mr Broman. For a moment, I thought we wouldn't have any fun at all. Got to grease all them people, else they shut you down. I didn't take a dime from you, you crazy old bastard. Hey. Marvin... We don't come up soon, they'll come and get us. What you think they'd do about me? You'll pay a fine for pouring liquor without a licence... but I need you to testify against George. You got some leverage. Wanna make your situation worse? Just keep thinking what you're thinking. You pay a little fine, plead to disorderly. But you got to promise me you'll show up against George. I got to have that shotgun. Now. Good man. Go on up. Alcee, Marvin's coming up. Get him downtown. Take real good care of him, okay? Were you really gonna shoot that old man? He had that shotgun pointed right at me. What were you thinking you'd do about me? I figured he'd shoot you. And I'd shoot him, get myself a medal. You'd be dead, of course. You got a right to remain silent, officer. Use it. 95 passengers and crew members are now feared lost. Navy divers were expected to work throughout the night. Will Thomas, are you there? They already have a crane trying to hoist the plane out of the water. We've got divers. Where's Peyton? Working late. You gonna eat? We've got bay scallops. I'll see if I can find her. The plane struck the surface at a shallow angle... and bounced at least one time before ploughing into the water nose first. I'm at Billy's. I'll call you at home. If we don't catch up, I'll eat here. He's got bay scallops. Love you. Bye. It's the Van Den Broecks. Leave a message and we'll call you back. To play back your messages, press one. Hi, I'm at the airport. The first time I send a catalogue to Miami without me, and it's falling apart. A new stylist, locations don't work, bugs biting the girls... and you don't wanna know what else. Therefore, I'm on the plane to kill critters and counsel careers. I'll try to get back tomorrow, but it may not be till Sunday. God knows where I'll sleep. They're in the Keys some place. I'll call you when I can. I had fun this morning. I love you. You find her? No. That plane was going to Miami, wasn't it? - Yeah. - Give me some quarters. I once got laid in Miami. My name's Van Den Broeck. I'm a Washington DC police officer if that makes any difference. I know you get a lot of crazies when something like this happens. I think it's possible my wife may have been on your aeroplane. Peyton Van Den Broeck. Great. Boy. She must be on another flight. Boy, that'll wake you up. What are the other flights to Miami? Check the 1:15, but it doesn't make sense. She left for the airport after 9:00. Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck, Peyton's husband. She went to Miami today. I need to know what plane she was on. I can be with you in just one moment. We don't have this in a six, but I can order it for you. I can try it in an eight. Excuse me. I'm Bill Van Den Broeck, Peyton's husband. She went to Miami today. I need to know what plane she was on. - You're the policeman? - That's right. Mary Claire Clark books the travel, but she goes home at 5:30. Can you reach her at home? Oh, my God. The plane that crashed. I don't know. She was going to Miami, but they don't have her listed. Molly, how do we get a hold of Mary Claire Clark? Excuse me. Do we have to shout? Peyton went to Miami. She might be on the plane that crashed. We have to find out what flight she was on. Does anyone know what Mary Claire Clark was doing tonight? Call the switchboard. Get her number at home. The airline won't tell you? She's not listed, but she's not listed on any flight. I know she was going. She left messages at work and home. They can't give out home numbers. This is Molly Roll. Who's this? Hi, Carla. I need your help. I'm the supervisor in Designer Wear... and you'll confirm that when you call me back at extension 293, okay? I need the home telephone number of Mary Claire Clark. She's the department secretary. We are managing an emergency. Do you understand? Thank you. You must be Dutch. I'm Molly. What was she doing in Miami? It sounded like some kind of crisis. You're shooting a catalogue in the Keys that was falling apart? What would we be shooting in the Keys? Did she say which catalogue? Molly Roll. Thank you. Sarah, would you get her for me? I'm going to get my boss. What catalogue are we shooting? What happened to Peyton? I didn't know we were doing a catalogue. Susan, are you working? Peyton didn't know she was going. We had a dinner date. There's no answer. She went directly to the airport. Somebody must've called her. Would she call Mary Claire for a reservation or would she... use a travel agent? This is Mr Driker, vice president of Designer Wear. He's our boss. - Would you excuse us, please? - Sure. Molly says Peyton may be on the plane that crashed. - Is Peyton on that plane? - We don't know. - Either way, she's toast. - Can you zip it? We don't have a catalogue shooting in Florida or anywhere else. The next catalogue's not till Christmas. Maybe it's not a catalogue. Something involving models. The girls were bit by bugs. No, there's nothing like that. If Peyton's travelling, I don't think it's for the store. I know when people are out of town. I approve it, and we're stingy on travel. Are you saying she lied to me? I'm saying I don't know where she is. I'm thinking of something I can do. I'd like to be helpful. There was this judge who had... two whole entire families, kids, dogs, everything. A judge. We think we know. We don't know. Nobody knows. You just don't know. Oh, my God. Maybe she travelled as someone's wife. If anyone knows what his name is... I could check that way. I don't know. Honestly. Beats me. She seemed... I mean, she never looked like she was looking. Like girls look if they're looking, okay? Mr Van Den Broeck... I think I know Peyton as well as anyone here. I've got no idea. Are you surprised? The important thing is we don't know if she was on the plane or not. I think she was on the plane. Jessie, tell me the truth. Are kids drinking at these parties? I invented some of the excuses you're giving me. I've been 15. You've never been 35. Okay, okay, 37. I'll see for myself Wednesday. Identification is the responsibility of the County Coroner. 5'6." 120. Blue eyes. A wedding band, just plain. A diamond ring, emerald-cut, about a carat. I'm telling you, she was on your plane. If I'm wrong, great. If I'm right, you know who to call, okay? Got some empty boxes? Ask the guy out back. Excuse me. Are you Mr Van Den Broeck? I'm David Dotson. This is Phyllis Bonaparte. Southern Airlines. Do you have a minute to talk to us? Sure. Mr Van Den Broeck... we don't show your wife as anybody's passenger on any flight to Miami. Hi, I'm at the airport. The first time I send a catalogue to Miami without me, and it's falling apart: A new stylist, locations don't work, bugs biting the girls... and you don't wanna know what else. Therefore, I'm on the plane to kill... No one named Van Den Broeck reserved or bought a ticket to Miami. There is no catalogue shoot. She works for Saks. They don't know where she is. I think she was gonna spend the weekend in Miami with another guy. If she was, would she tell the truth about her destination? Trick is not to lie more than you have to. Got a passenger list? I can't let you see it. I figure he bought the tickets "Mr and Mrs." I think he's married. Be interesting when you call his house. - I'm not allowed... - Let him see the list. - I need that back. - They'll give you another one. A Royal Regency Hotel is near where the plane went down. We have rooms there for family members. Why don't you drive down with us? You'll have to identify... To make the identification. Sit around with the next of kin? I got a lot of things to do. I don't think you should be alone right now. Oh, yeah? I was alone before you got here. Everybody, listen up. Listen up. A guy thinks his wife was on 737... travelling with a man on Mr and Mrs tickets. He's a DC cop, so as far as we know, he's not nuts. Who the wife's boyfriend is, he hasn't got a clue. We got nine Mr and Mrs on the manifest. Another two pair sitting together, same last name. Married, cousins, who knows? Be careful. Don't assume a deceased Mrs is for real. We don't wanna be the ones telling some widow her husband died happy. And we don't wanna tell kids that Mum's gone when Mum's asleep in Bethesda. What does your sex life have to do with saving social security? Tell me that. According to Shirley Magnuson, everything. What is the worst thing you've ever done? If I've already done it, it'll be a dull life. You're gonna be a big disappointment to old Shirley. You think Cullen's the last man you'll ever sleep with? Wendy. College was best. All that stuff going on. "When's he gonna call? When's he gonna kiss me?" At night, when I bring it back... I get that ache all over again. I'm gonna tell Richard we'd better host a fund-raiser. Come over tonight, both of you. We can make a guest list. He's in New York. What the hell you doing here on Saturday? George and Clayton made bond. You know this ain't the best case we ever made. We got Clayton's statement. Did you read him his rights? He'll say I didn't. We got Marvin. Something wrong with you? What's wrong, Dutch? Dick? Dick? Sorry. Three A and B, Mr and Mrs Cullen Chandler. No one's called. There's an unlisted number for a Cullen Chandler at the Metropolitan. Doorman says Mrs Chandler is a congresswoman. And he saw her today. She was going jogging. When I was small, I knew my father was in politics. I didn't know what that was, or why he went to Washington. Let's make it "dad." "My dad." Instead of "father." Warms it up a little. "Dad." All right. Kay Chandler, take three. Hello. I'm Kay Chandler and I'm running for Congress. When I was small, I knew my dad was in politics... Maybe it should be "kid." "When I was a kid"... "When I was just a kid." How about that? "When I was a kid." Help you? We need to speak to Mrs Chandler. - We're taping. - It's all right. What is it? Mrs Chandler, I'm Dick Montoya. This is Phyllis Bonaparte. We're with Southern Airlines. Is there somewhere we can talk? Well, about what? I'm very sorry to have to tell you. Your husband was on our flight... to Miami yesterday. What? The one that... No, no, no. Cullen's in New York. I wish that were so, madam. You do fly to New York, don't you? Not from Washington, no, madam. No. I'm afraid the identification is correct. I'm awfully sorry. He said he was going to New York. Why would he go to Miami? The identification is correct. We have his wallet. I'm very sorry. Mrs Chandler, if something did happen to your husband... it'll lead the news tonight in New Hampshire. Where's your daughter? We have a daughter. She's 15. We won't release the casualty list till all families are notified. But we need your help identifying your husband. Where is he? Patuxent Naval Air Station. - I have to get home. - I understand. Let us help. Call Dick Taradisian at the White House. Tell him what the deal is. Ask him if there's any possible way to get a plane to meet us at Patuxent. If the Air Force can't do it, call GM or anybody with a jet. He did say Miami. Usually it's New York, but this time he said Miami. Mr Van Den Broeck, we have a car for you. Ma, what are you doing home? Where's Dad? Thou anointest my head with oil. My cup runneth over. Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me... all the days of my life... and I will dwell in the house of the Lord forever. Let us pray. Almighty God, Father of mercies and giver of all comfort... I met this guy because he was smart enough to get out of the rain. I was too. So we waited under the arch in the Law quad till it was over. And then he asked me... if I knew where the bookshop was. And I said... I happened to be going there myself, which was a lie, of course. We had so many great days. Just not enough years. But we had his love. Maybe I'll call you. Let's go. Excuse me. Excuse me. Are you Mary Claire Clark? Yes. I am so sorry. The name Cullen Chandler mean anything to you? No. If I'd called my wife that morning, what would you have said? That she called in and said she was taking the day off. But you wouldn't have gotten me. She sent me to Tyson's Corners... and said I could go home. So I'd have gotten her voice mail? - Yeah. - Thank you. - Mr Van Den Broeck? - Yes? I have some of her... personal things. I could drop them off... I'll take them now. I know. I got to get out of here. I'll take Jess with me. Kay, it's gonna look like... I don't care. Just get us back to Washington. I can't see all these people. It's like going through... Don't make a mistake now, Mrs Chandler. Everybody's watching. Just one more day. How can I find out if a guy was on a flight to Miami in May? My name is Bill Van Den Broeck. - They said you're a policeman. - Yeah, I am. But I'm not working right now. Then what is this about? My wife was on that plane that your husband was on. I'm sorry. I wonder if I could have a few minutes. I just got home. This isn't a good time for me. For me either. So you're visiting survivors. You're the only one. I'd ask you to sit... I don't understand. My daughter's due back any minute. Do you have kids? Jessica. She's 15. Is there something you wanna know, Mr...? I'm sorry, I forgot your name. It's Van Den Broeck. I just thought that... I'm so sorry. It's really... It's unspeakable. Unspeakable. But you seem okay. Do I? Paper said your husband was a lawyer in New Hampshire. He has an office here. Most of his work was here. I'm in Congress. Yeah, I know. So why was he going to Miami? Business. He had business there. Are you investigating something? They were sitting together on the plane. Your husband. My wife. Do you know that? Three A and B. First class. First class isn't what it used to be. It's not worth the money. Is there anything else? You mad at me? I don't know you, Lieutenant. Why would I be mad? I'm a Sergeant. What are you? A sophisticator? That's my daughter. Sorry. An airline guy left Dad's things downstairs... so I brought them up. This is my daughter, Jessica. This is Sergeant... Van Den Broeck. They call me Dutch. It's easier. He lost his wife on the plane. I'm sorry. Never been to New Hampshire. You go to school there or here? I go to Andover. It's a prep school. I won't take any more of your time. - I'm sorry about your dad. - Thanks. Nice to meet you. I need an hour. It's not a lot to ask. Don't come around here again. They must've cleaned them. It must... I'm sure it's for your birthday. Dad said he was gonna get you something great. Expensive. He knew I'd say no. Mum... I know you're worried about me... but I still want you to run. I'll be fine. I don't want us to sit around here all day and be depressed. I'm gonna go back to school tomorrow. All my friends are there. And it's only 40 miles. I can come home on weekends if I want. Somebody popped Marvin. Jesus Christ. Shit. George Beaufort did this. What else did you find in here? Anything? Is this a bad time? I don't need to go through all that garbage. My case'll get kicked because somebody killed my only witness. - You get in there and do it. - Easy, easy. The last pickup was a week ago. It hasn't been that long. It sure smells long. Sheila, what are you doing here? That ain't even my name. Let's talk to these people. You take that side, I'll take this side. It's Homicide's. - We're off it. - The hell we are. I will not allow you to... I don't have any choice. I need your help. Before you dropped by to tell me my husband was screwing your wife... did it occur to you that that might be hurtful thing to do? You knew already. Suppose I didn't. How did you know? He told me he was going to New York. He was on the wrong plane, so it must be another woman? Just like that? Well, it could've been amnesia. My wife was in Miami in February and in May. - Do you think your husband was? - What difference does it make? It's over. It's entirely over. They're through with each other. We are through with them. We can't even get a divorce. You can do that. I have a child. I try and go back... in my head. What's the last thing you remember... about you and your husband that you know is true? I got to find out how far back I have to go to do that. This is where they were gonna stay. I've got work to do. Don't you wanna know how it started? How long it was going on? You don't wanna know their plans? You don't wanna know anything? What she thought when she thought about me. I'd like to know that. I thought you might like to know what she looked like. You leave me alone. I mean it. Thirty. Take a number and have a seat. Alice Beaufort? George Beaufort's wife? Is he all right? He's fine. I'm Sergeant Van Den Broeck. I'd like to ask a few questions. He was with me. What time was that? Any time you're talking about. Thirty-one. You've got an envelope. February was swimsuits and May was fall fashion. And you saw those catalogues? I saw the catalogues. I told you twice. I'll get them for you. How do we know she shot them in Miami? What if...? There were palm trees. There was a beach and a very big ocean. If she doesn't run, she's crazy. Tell him. It's a sympathy bounce, but she's up 14 points since the funeral. I think she'll stay in, but she'll need some time. She's this brave widow with this kid. They're eating it up. You're hard. She knows. I know she knows. Maybe he was buying a boat. Maybe it was drugs or government work. Why are you so determined it's another woman? Why are you protecting him? If you know who it is, I swear... You think I lied the first five times, but now I'll cave? Why is this so important to you? I caught Sam with a woman once. I spilled a milkshake on my skirt, so I ran home from lunch. I heard them in the shower. And at first, I thought it was the radio. But what she was saying you don't hear on the radio. I ran. I couldn't go back to work. For hours, literally... I didn't remember... that I was involved with someone else. I had been for months. And I liked my life with Sam. Things were fine. What'd you do? I kept my mouth shut. And I never went home again without calling first. To say that involvement... and I don't mean casual sex, I mean romance. To say that that whole part of life... half the fun of life has to end... If you told me that had to be over... I'd feel old. If you had known about Peyton... would you tell me? Now, I mean. No. I'm gonna run to the ladies' room. Get me another one. Broman's over there dreaming up ways to remind you of my loss. A detective came by the office today... asking about Cullen. I wasn't there. Barry said he asked how much Cullen travelled. He seemed particularly interested in Miami. Asked who our Miami clients were. Said he was going there tomorrow. Is this anything I should know about? I have no idea. I'm sorry. It's too soon. - I'm sorry. - I wanna go home. Wait for Wendy. I'll get a cab. Tell Wendy I'm sorry. Leave a message. I'll call you back. Mr Van Den Broeck? Hi. I'm so sorry about Peyton. Come. Have a coffee. February, we shoot in the studios... May, the Keys, to get away from tourists. Why come to Miami twice in a row? Why not go somewhere else? I would like to think it was my work... but I suspect so she can walk the city and sketch. She loved the streets, the markets... the Latin music. Was there a man? I don't think there is a man, no. What did she do after work? More walking. But sometimes the clubs, for music and to watch the dancing. You know who she went with? If I can say... If you wanna be with a woman, these shoots are not so good for that. Did you ever sleep with Peyton? Your situation is very difficult. I excuse the question. Could I talk to somebody in your security department? It looks like she did. Can we talk some place? Stoli, please, on the rocks. I'm from a little town in a little state. And unfortunately, I'm in Congress. So when you interview people, it's easy to start talk. They might stumble on the truth. You can't possibly want that. You're the only one I wanna talk to. I don't know anything. What do you wanna know? - How long it went on. - So we know how stupid to feel? How they met, their plans. I can't help you. At least you tried. You trying to be funny? No. Not any more. Don't you fuck with me. If you don't like that word, don't use it. Do you know what happens when a member of Congress accuses you of harassment? We'd get our names in the newspapers. That's close to blackmail. I'm not a lawyer. I'm not some investigation. You can't rummage through my life. Who's next on your list? My neighbours, staff, friends? Then talk to me. So you can paw through my marriage? Make me confess to something? My life is mine to judge, not yours. You're not the only one involved. Look, if they find out about your wife, it's gossip. If they find out about my husband, it's in the papers. I have a daughter who adores her father, who doesn't know. What do I tell her? I don't know. Come on. Let me show you something. Nice, huh? I figure they would've had drinks here. - Want to see their room? - No. - They never got here. - Not this time, anyway. She stayed here February 19th. Also May 14th, on business. If he was with her, he didn't register. Did your husband like Latin stuff? Music, dancing? Why? The concierge booked them a table at a place called La Roca. Cullen liked classical music. You sure? - What? - Nothing. Do you know what I do for a living? I get paid to notice stuff. I get paid to know who's lying. I didn't have a clue. I missed it. I thought we were happy. Not giddy... not ecstatic. We weren't unhappy. I wasn't. I was pretty happy. I don't wanna be here. I don't wanna be here. That's Kay Chandler. Hi. Peter Suchet. East Concord. Voted for your dad. Do you mind? Honey, take another picture. - They took our picture. - You know them? They're from Concord. They took our picture. I bury my husband and go nightclubbing in Miami. - Stay here. - Where are you going? To get the film. God, no. You can't just mug some guy. It'll just make things worse. You are a cop. Is that gonna be trouble for you? What'd we look like? We looked like... You had your hand on my shoulder. You don't care who knows, do you? About her and him, I mean. I care. They know anyway. Sooner or later, everybody knows everything. What time is it? My plane's at 9:30. A little after 8:00. Sure you don't wanna stay over? Yes. Maybe we should split up. We should've stayed. I'm in restricted parking. I took the metro. It's not running now. I'll get a cab. Where do you live? Northwest. It's out of your way. Do you want me to drop you or not? You know where we're going. Why? Stayed? Why? Why? Because they were going to? God. Easy. Goddamn it. Stop it. Stop it now. Well, that was fun. Don't. Just drive. Unbelievable. - You want to come in, or...? - Don't be ridiculous. Pick up the phone, you son of a bitch. You like scaring women? You come around my wife one more time and... No, no. You come and try to scare me, asshole. Chickenshit. 10:52 p.m. End of messages. Last number called: 555-4421. Press one to connect. Parkway Lanes. Is George Beaufort still there? Dutch, hold on, man. What the hell you... Whoa. Back it up. Knock it off. Take it outside. Take it outside. Son of a bitch. Get off me. Get off me. Back off. Son of a bitch. Come on. Somebody call the police. I have your badge now, baby. You'd better get a lawyer. George killed that man. Goddamn it. You can't go around beating up suspects. You're suspended. There will be a trial board. You assaulted a man. You can lose your job. How tough would it be if somebody swore they saw George at that dumpster? How tough would that be? I was thinking. If you went to see the shrink... Wouldn't cost nothing. Talk about Peyton. It could help. I don't need to talk about Peyton. I could tell them you got stressed out on the job. It wouldn't be a lie. Honk if you're screwing him. Save a plane ticket. Where'd you get that? Shirley Magnuson. Says she thinks it's phoney. Says I'm setting her up. Setting her up? I take the picture, make sure it gets slipped to her, she uses it. I provide a perfectly innocent explanation. Ta-da. - Her candidate's a mudslinger. - My God, you people. Pretty good idea. I wish I'd had it. If you have to explain that picture, can you do it? Yes. Jessie. - Where's your bracelet? - It's around. You didn't lose it? It's around. What's the matter? It's not my bracelet. What? Dad didn't have any clients in Miami, did he? He was with that cop's wife, huh? What was going on? Something. I'm not sure what. Were they serious? That'd be my guess. Do a lot of people know? Leave a message. I'll call you back. It's me. Remember? From restricted parking? So you picked Peyton. And Cullen picked Peyton. That's two-zip against the home team. "Have we been introduced?"... she says, straightening her clothes. I thought I should introduce myself and fill you in on my plans. I'm packing it in. No. That sounds like suicide. All I mean is, like you said, sooner or later... everybody knows everything... and this'll be in the papers... and I can't handle that. I can't let Jessica be mowed down... by gossip she had nothing to do with. But if I'm not in Congress, if I'm out... it's not news any more. She's safe. You know? You do know, don't you? You're the only one who does. And I miss that. Hey, do me a favour. Erase this. God, I'm glad you're not there. Kay? She's getting a lot of points for showing up. - How are you guys doing? - Fine, how are you? Excuse me for just a minute. My contribution. If you quit, they win. And the crash got us all. Don't let them do that. I'm not the only one involved. She should know her mum's no quitter. Wanna say how impressed I am that you're staying in. I have to say a few things. The name of this group is "Friends of Kay Chandler." I'm sorry about that phone call. We're not getting much sleep, are we? - I'm afraid of what's playing. - Me too. Might give it a try. Turn in around 3. Cullen would be proud of you. I know you know. I don't know how many times I've introduced Kay Chandler. There's a lot between 3:00 and 5:00 Australian football. May I present your friend... your congresswoman... Don't go away. Your next representative for the 2nd district of New Hampshire... Kay Spencer-Chandler. Thank you. Thank you, Richard. Thank you, all. It's good to be home. I wanted to say just a word. Just a few words. You're all being very nice to me. I don't wanna disappoint you. But I just don't wanna talk politics tonight. I'm just glad to be home. Richard and Wendy, thank you so much. Thanks, all of you, for your friendship, for your support... for showing up here tonight. Thanks. I mean it. Don't leave without me getting a chance to talk to you, okay? We love you, Kay. Well done, Kay. Very nice. I want a chance to talk to you. Be back first thing. - Do you have the number? - You told me 15 times already. Sorry. I wish I could get out of the party. No way, missy. Some of these are $1,000 folks. I just wish I didn't have to go. It was good of you to come. It was our party. Kind of had to. I appreciate it, that's all. Thank you. You get a ticket? It's a road map. Maybe someone thought it fell out of my car. Listen, Kay. Time to commit. All the way in or not. If you're not running, we need to return that fundraiser money quick. Maybe I'll take a day. Do some thinking. I'll be around. I wondered if you'd come. Guy like you, girl like me. What reason could there be not to? Sorry I'm late. I had to change a few times and pack. I thought... if I packed light, it'd look like I knew what I was doing. But I didn't know what I was doing, so I didn't know what to pack. Where are we exactly? Chesapeake Bay's a couple miles that way. I won't make small talk. I don't want there to be any junk between us. No littering. There's so many reasons I might be doing this. I kept thinking, I'll go one more mile... then I'll turn around and... I was thinking about your mouth. Nobody knows who I am any more. Nobody knows how easily I can do this. I know who you are. I have to know something. Are you a Democrat? What if I am? We talk. I give you books to read. I like it when there's just the two of us. Are you hungry? I'm hungry. No TV? Is there a phone? Not so far. What's that like? Quiet. What is this? Do you know? Heineken. The start of something? Yeah. That's what I thought. I want to know who is this woman who's wearing my clothes... and using my body? Is she permanent? Or is she only around when you are? Let's hide out here for a couple of years and make a run for the border. I always thought when I had my time in... I'd like to live down here. Start a little security service. The raccoons are knocking over the garbage cans? A lot of Washington, Baltimore people have places on the water here. They always think they're gonna get robbed. You had plans. I don't think we had any plans. I always wanted a boat. One you could sleep on. We've got a boat. Defence Rests. Get it? I've got a boat. I'll give it to you. I don't trust this any more than you do. But you're the only thing that's real. Let me ask you something tough. Are you sorry the plane went down? What are you doing? Just think about it. You can have it all back the way it was. But you got to take it all. He's lying. He's screwing another woman. They laugh at how easy we are to fool. Stop. Don't do that. I'm done with them. Done with them. - The thing is... - Stop. Come on. Let's go home. You know those drugstore kits that tell you when you're pregnant? They should have one that tells you when you're sane. I think they had a place they'd meet. An apartment just makes sense. How could it make sense? No driving, no motels. If they did, they did. They're on their own. This was in her desk at work. Is that why you drew the map? - Is that why you came to Concord? - I didn't want you to quit. - People have keys. - Did you see one like this? - No. - In his luggage maybe? So they had a place. They're not there any more. And I don't care. I just don't care. Maybe you didn't lose that much. Or you're lying to yourself. The sun's going down. It's time to go. When will you be back? The roof's got a leak. I've got time. So I thought I'd make it worse. Maybe we'll never get clear of how we met. Maybe we'll never be alone. But I don't want us to lose this chance because... if it's just gonna be about them, if it'll always be four of us... You be careful driving home. Thanks for driving all the way to Concord. And for the contribution. And I don't even live in your district. You have one message. It's me, Wendy. Where've you been? I have $50,000 from your friends and neighbours, and nobody to give it to. What do you wanna do? Lunch tomorrow? Give me a call. Come on, Alcee. Just get me a picture of him. Headshot's okay. Give me the photo from his ID. All right. I'll call you when I get back. I want Jessica out there, smiling like Chelsea and keeping her mouth shut. Her job is good kid. No opinions. She can wear jeans. No short shorts, no bra tops. No Jessica. She's in school. School? We're trying to win an election here. No Jessica. I don't want her... I think I may be losing what it takes to lie. - This may become a problem. - Let's take a break. - I don't like this. - Just asking. We're telling the whole south-east side an officer's a murder suspect. You think George ain't gonna hear hear about this? You're not supposed to be working. That's why you're here. Shyla? You in there? Hello? Anybody home? Hey, Shyla, we need to talk. Can we come in? No, you can't come in. You wanna come out then? You get out of here. Folks see me talk to you, get my ass in trouble. Goddamn it, Dutch. Come on, man. Come on. - You got no right in here. - I ain't gonna hurt you. Let's go. You got no warrant. She said "no." If my brother faced 15 months in detention... it wouldn't hurt to look at one picture. You seen this man before? That's Big George. I see him all over. Did you see him in the alley the night we found the body? No. You didn't maybe see him dump that man in the dumpster? Maybe with somebody else? No. Look again. Maybe it'll come back to you. Any chance your brother'll get out? Okay, that's it. You didn't see him. Sorry to have disturbed you. I want you out right now. Out now. What's the hell's matter with you? Look, Dutch, I'm sorry about your wife. You want George to come after you? Is that it? So you can shoot him? - You got tired of working cheap? - What? You know goddamn well he's guilty. Why are you protecting him? Is he paying you now? Oh, man. Here. I feel like a bagman. There's cash in there, so be careful. Well, guess what? Cullen was having an affair. Tru says Ahi tuna's incredible here. That's why he went to Miami. How long? What's the difference? You think being deaf, dumb and blind is a liability for a congresswoman? I think he kept an apartment that I don't know about. Would you like to hear our specials? Give us a minute, please. And I thought maybe... Cullen had told Richard... and Richard had said something. Hey, come on. It's only adultery. Nobody gives a damn except the people it happens to. It's not happening to... My God. Please give me a chance to explain. Shut up. Kay, it didn't mean... I was always gonna tell you. Where is it? It's been over a year. I haven't been there... Where is it? The Colton Building on Rhode Island. It was just stupid. I'm not hungry. If you could get the check, please. Stop, please, Kay. Just listen to me, okay, because... if we don't see you, Richard'll know. I can't keep seeing you so your husband won't know you've been screwing mine. Kay. Kay, please. I need to tell you... how rotten I feel. Let me go, punkin. - Hello? - Hello. It's me. Bad time? How's the roof? Lousy. Is something wrong? Wanna get something to eat? Sure. I'm not that hungry, but I wanna see you. Everything all right? Weren't you ever tempted to cheat on Peyton? Tempted? Yeah. Sure. Why didn't you? Maybe I did. I don't think so. I wonder how they got their laundry done, if they had a place. You think this... everything that happened... You think it's... made you different? Different how? More suspicious. Maybe. But here I am. I'm leaving you tomorrow. I knew we should've gone to McDonald's. I have to try to get elected. I lost a friend today... being suspicious. What if you don't get elected? Country goes to hell... and I go home. For keeps. But you're gonna beat this guy, right? When I get back... I'll be here. I'll nail his ass. Here you go, Clara. Back Friday. Wait up a second. You got some dry cleaning. Sorry. Saks Fifth Avenue. Employees' entrance. I'll get him. Sorry, Dutch. Ladies' room. Mary Claire. You wouldn't believe all the keys I've got. I got a key to the Vic Tanny's in Rochester. I've got keys to the ones in Westchester. I don't think there was an apartment. She was always here. There wasn't time. No, wait. You know, she gave me a phone number once. She was on her way to a meeting... Just a minute. Yeah, this is it. Yeah. In the bottom, in pencil. Go right ahead. Can I have the 911 supervisor, please? This is Sergeant Van Den Broeck, DC Internal Affairs. 9114. I need an address please for a telephone number. How long did you know? Did you know when you came to Miami? No. How could you ever think...? When you came to my cabin, did you know then? I found out yesterday. So you knew last night. When were you gonna tell me? I thought... I thought maybe... years from now... when it's behind us. What did you find? Nothing. Dutch, you weren't... We had a pact. Then what the hell are you doing here? I wanna finish it. I want it over. That your purse? What'd you find? What did you find? There's nothing here. Oh, Christ. I can smell her perfume. Stop it, Dutch. There's nothing here. There's got to be something left... some sign of... Stop it. You'll never find what you're looking for. Never. You wanna know why. And there is no why. Don't. If you check in, I'm heading for the airport early. Meet me for coffee. Hi, it's me. I'm running late. There was something I needed to do. If I'm not there, go without me. I'll get the next plane and meet you at the hotel. What are we doing? Do you know? We made love that morning. That's why she was late. Shit. Get an ambulance. I'm okay. Get out of the car. Get out. Help. Kay Chandler. Congresswoman from New Hampshire. Police report said her husband got it on with Van Den Broeck's wife. He kept a love shack in the building. You all right? The press is out there and they know you're here. They could get hungry and go somewhere for a hamburger. How we gonna handle this? Handle it. "Handle" is when you've got a client who'll tell you what's going on. We can assume they'll wanna know just how well the congresswoman knows the cop. - How are we gonna handle this? - I don't know. If we can get back to New Hampshire and let this age a day... A back elevator will get us out through the basement. He's right, Kay. What time is it? - It's almost midnight. - Somebody stole my watch. Where's Alcee? He said he'd come by tomorrow. I was trying to catch up with you. What were you going to say? I don't know what I was gonna say. I just... I just didn't want you to leave. Not like that, anyway. Welcome back. Hungry? Where's my watch? They need you in X-ray. Listen... I probably never would've told you about the place either. All I wanted... What I want, really... is just to find some way... to let her go... and move on. I don't know how you do that. Neither do I. It's not a crime, Dutch. You loved your wife. And you still do. All set. Let me see if I can find a couple of orderlies. Will you hang around? I can't. You're supposed to be nice to me. I've been shot. We did okay, Dutch. We did the best we could... under the circumstances. Ready, Sergeant? It's time for you to go. Me too. Will that be all right? So long, Kay. Here she comes. Can you tell us what you were doing...? What's the Sergeant's condition? I've got to catch a plane, but if you can make it short... We've been told your husband was having an affair with Van Den Broeck's wife. They had an apartment, and that's where you were. Is that correct? Yes, it is. Could you characterise your relationship with the Sergeant. Sergeant Van Den Broeck's wife was killed on the plane that went down with my husband. I met the Sergeant a few days after that day. He was a friend when I needed a friend. I hope he feels the same way. So you're just friends? Just friends. We are surely friends. We've seen each other through something... We're more than friends. We're survivors. You'll have to excuse me. I have to get home. Can you tell us more about the Sergeant's condition? Is he responsive? - See you Friday, sweetie. - Bye, Mum. Bye, Mrs Chandler. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. Do I know you? I'm Tad Baker. I work for Mr Cornelius. You said we could... Yeah, sure. Make yourselves at home. Hello, Kay. Hi, Sergeant. Lieutenant. They made me a Lieutenant. All I had to do was get shot. Can I get you something? Stoli on the rocks. I haven't had one of those in a while. I got a plane. I don't have time. What's with those New Hampshire voters? Are they crazy or what? I think they could tell I didn't want the job. Or maybe I wanted the job, I just didn't wanna do what you have to do to get it. So you're out of work. Guess I am. Are you as well as you look? Leg's a little stiff. But I think I'm gonna be okay. You? How's that football in Australia? I tune in once in a while. Not like before. I was a real fan. I got to tell you, I thought I might run into you here. Where are you going? That's the thing. Nowhere. I called your office, and they said that you were... headed home, so... My flight's overbooked and I... Go later. Take another plane. It's my Christmas present, running into you. What'd you get me? How about... I call you up sometime in New Hampshire? And say what? Say... "You wanna go to a movie?" What do you say? Wouldn't that be something?
