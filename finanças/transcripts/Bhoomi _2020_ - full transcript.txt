This is a universe with no boundaries. That consists of numerous astounding facts. Just like the earth we live on, scientists have discovered 4000 planets. Except for earth, humans or animals can't live on any other planets. These planets that don't favor living habitat... can be developed into a living habitat, was the question posed. All the scientists in the world said, it's impossible. But there was one scientist who said it is possible. The name of that scientist is, Bhoominathan. Surprised that it's a Tamil name? Bhoominathan hails from a small village called Paradhu in Tamilnadu. While the other kids were busy studying A for Apple... he was busy studying about the aperture of radar. That zeal of his, made him discover a satellite at the age of fourteen. And that discovery led him to NASA. Bhoominathan, studied under NASA's scholarship... and has grown to be a scientist that NASA is really proud of. Just like the earth we live on... Bhoominathan said he will change Mars into a living habitat like earth. Bhoominathan said he will change Mars into a living habitat like earth. Is it possible? Can it be done naturally by science? Millions have raised questions about it. World leading journalists are waiting with those questions. Let's meet Mr. Bhoominathan. Thank you. Sir, is it possible for humans to live on Mars? Six years ago, we sent a Rover to Mars from NASA. Through that Rover, we got Mars' atmospheric conditions, the percentage of gases, and the sample of Martian soil. From the details we collected at our space station... we re-created the exact atmospheric conditions of Mars. Everyone is aware that Mars comprises of 96% Carbon dioxide. In order for our team to survive, I've invented a medicine. If we take this tablet, you can inhale the carbon dioxide... and live for a few days. After we successfully re-created the Martian soil... we started farming on that soil. The results astonished our team. Sir, when will you take us to Mars? First, we'll throw atom bombs on the glaciers... and bring out the water and oxygen it contains. The next step is, our team of eleven, will be sent by NASA to Mars to do farming. Once we've successfully grown plants and trees... we'll send the birds as guests to Mars. Sir, why do you have to take birds to Mars? That's a good question. Birds are the first-farmers of the world. We humans didn't create these forests. It's a huge task. If birds start to create forests... we'll have enough oxygen for humans to live on the planet. So, just like earth, Mars will become our new world. CBFC COPY All I need is one seed. I can create a whole new world. Sir, who is your inspiration and role model? As you may think, it's not Albert Einstein or Nikolo Tesla. My village is a small hamlet situated in Tirunelveli. There lives a farmer called Velusamy. It's him who taught me everything about agriculture. Vanakkam, sir! What is it? We had filed a petition requesting compensation for damaged crops. Just because you filed a petition, does that mean government will compensate? Sir, despite taking a loan for irrigation.. still the crops ended up charred. You people do one thing. Go and meet the Collector and file a petition. He might feel sorry, and find a solution for it. Sir, we've tried a lot to meet the collector. -But he doesn't take time to meet us. -Obviously! As if his job description is to serve you people. Do you think, I'm sitting idle out here, jobless? You guys come over for no reason. Get lost. Listen, if they return, please ask to not let them inside. They don't even let a man eat in peace. Hi! Hey! The entire world is in awe with my son. I should ward off evil of you. Mom, forget about that. I've been granted a month's holiday. What are you going to do for a month? Mom, it'll take three to four years to complete the Mars mission. So, let us go to our village and celebrate this success. To our village? Are you serious? -Let's go, son! -Shall we? Say you're a proud Thamizhan Hold your head high with pride Go on and conquer the world Say you're a proud Thamizhan Hold your head high with pride Go on and conquer the world I wandered around the world I even touched the sky But there is something about this land...

Uncle, how are your children? Look, Meenakshi is right over here. -I wasn't asking about Meenakshi. -Obviously, we know her. I'm talking about the crops you consider more than your life. They're well and good. Auntie has made special meal for you. Let's go and eat. Hey, our village has changed a lot. If that surprises you, look at our school that has changed drastically. He's the reason why co-ed-school turned into boys school. And you're telling him about it. How is Shakti? You still haven't forgotten her? She's still that scary chicken you kissed during our time in school. Why are you so scared? -One second. Muruga! Muruga! -Don't be scared. It's simple. -All is well. All is well. -Don't shake, hold tight. -Muruga! Muruga! -Oh, god! You go ahead and take it. That's how I am. Oh, no, I'm really scared. Muruga! -Hey! -It's impossible if you keep shaking. Hey. You haven't changed a bit in all these years. Looks your phobia for everything hasn't changed. Hello, I'm not scared. Even the mighty body-builder Arnold is scared of needles. Last week she was walking alone on the street. The dog on the street just stared at her. The way she screamed looking at the dog... made all the dogs in that area migrate to another place. -Hey, stop it, damn it. -Let go of my hand. Wait, let him see it. Do you know why she keeps it with her? According to her all the ghosts and spirits are behind her. And it seems they'll attack her. So, she carries this with her 24/7. Get lost, fatso. Don't lie about my fear. Last week at 02:00am... I was alone on the terrace looking at the lunar eclipse. Oh, no! Muruga! So, is this how you looked at the lunar eclipse? -Devils! -Stop picking on her. Carry on buddy, we know about your antics pretending to console her. Shakti, why are you getting pissed? It was just friends pulling your leg. I can understand they did, but you joined them and laughed at me. During childhood, I always came to defend you when someone made fun of you. Okay, I'll apologize to you. Sorry! Okay? Sorry won't cut it. Right thing to do is to support me, when someone is mocking me. Instead you joined them in mocking me. You're my beautiful angel. Dear, you're my only love. To sink into your mesmerizing eyes... I've come beyond the skies. You're my beautiful angel. You're my beautiful angel. I thought you said you're not scared. But you're shivering. Hey, what are you doing? Why did you pluck my hair? This strand of hair is enough. I'll come to know about all your feelings from it. Wait and watch. I'll come with the report tomorrow. Hair is that part of the body, that collects all details about our body. If you may ask to what extent, when forensics, run chemical tests on one's hair, it will tell who they are and what they've done. It'll extract entire information. In simple terms, one's horoscope will be known. You heard it, right. What were you feeling at that moment? I had mixed feelings at that moment. You had mixed feelings? Awesome! So, the test will show your estrogen, and dopamine levels. Does that mean, my love won't be shown? Only these things will show up? I highly doubt about love. It will only show that you were turned on. Oh, no, if that reflects on the test... it'll be embarrassing. You should've thought about it when you closed your eyes. -Hello, -Mr. Astronaut. What have you done to Shakti? She was blabbering your name in sleep throughout the night. I've sent you a video. Have a look. I like Bhoomi a lot since childhood. We both will get married. I'll take pride in calling, Bhoomi my husband. I'll have three cute children just like him. But we will stay like children to one another. Hey, why did you ask me to come? What are you looking at? Do you remember the report? The report is out. I'm looking at it. Take a look. I like Bhoomi a lot since childhood. We both will get married. I'll take pride in calling, Bhoomi my husband. Hey, wai-- Hey, I'll be gone for three years. Will you still love me? These three years that I'm going to be away from you... I'll be loving you from Mars! Will you love me from here? You're going to be here for a month, right. So, give me all the love for three years in just this one month. He looked at her She also looked at him That second ran into ages Will wake up shuddering Suffering from inability to bear He threw a glance at me... from the corner of his eye Relish looking at you from the corner of my eye My dear wallflower! Was waiting till date for the rains To dance under the umbrella Relish looking at you from the corner of my eye My dear wallflower! Was waiting till date for the rains To dance under the umbrella With two legs that wouldn’t stand on the ground With water that wouldn’t care to stop at the bank Your thoughts do not stop to sleep Your blooming face interrupts my search for life Darling, oh, my dearling! My heart is with you! Relish looking at you from the corner of my eye My dear wallflower! He looked at her She also looked at him I hid myself; I vanished From everything I saw my fear leave me after I met you I unfurled and I wandered Like a creeper, on your chest though, I will be like a flower Lashes unfurl and embraces you to the palace of love Poem I penned nervously, is finally reciting on my lips Hey, this moment is all I wanted honey I became a droplet and froze The soul and the body would melt as a candle Darling, oh, my dearling! My heart is with you! Relish looking at you from the corner of my eye Palani, why are you standing outside? Please come inside the house. We'll have coffee. It's been three years since you took a loan and you've been dodging me. Just give me some time. I will return the money. You live in a rented house. Your crops are charred. Your land is drowning in pawned debt. How will you return the money? We've filed a petition at the collector's office requesting for compensation. I will get the money. I'll return it next week. You mean, "Respected, sir... as the crops in our fields have been charred, we request you to immediately grant us compensation." Did I read that right? A couple of days ago when I visited the collector's office... I was served fritters on that paper. And you still believe you'll get your compensation. Palani, you were very respectful of me. It will be embarrassing, if the neighbors hear it. Please be respectful. You can't bloody return the money, you don't deserve any respect. I should get my money back in four days. If that doesn't happen, my men will reside in your house. They won't leave your house, until you pay off your dues. You have only four days. Everyone please disassemble and leave. The collector has an important meeting to attend. He has asked to come to the office and file a petition tomorrow. We filed many petitions to date. For past three seasons, we're left with charred crops. Despite taking loans on interest to do agriculture... we're not even blessed with one course meal. That doesn't mean you can stage protest blocking the roads. Please visit the collector tomorrow at the office. If he had met us at the office, we wouldn't be staging a protest. Take a look at this crop. Not only is it charred... protesting for it has destroyed us too. Please ask him to meet us. How is Devi madam? She's doing well. Shall I introduce you to, Lal, sir? Sir, my family is in hardship. I'm doing all this to pursue my studies. -Sir! -I'm there for you. -What is it? -I tried a lot, they don't seem to budge. If you meet them, they might listen to you. Aren't you ashamed? If you had sent them away, I could've promoted you. Get lost. Sir, there are pregnant woman and old people in the crowd. You didn't join the force to show empathy. People are getting too used to protesting. They should never ever think of protesting... do something on that degree. Go. Brother, what seems to be the problem? They're jobless people. Farmers are protesting. You're pregnant, you shouldn't be here. -Go home, dear. -It's okay, I'll stay right here. Assemble! Charge! Hey! Brother. Oh, god. Oh, no! Oh, my god. Uncle! Uncle. Uncle. Do you want to know why I blocked the collector's car? -Why I blocked? -Oh, no. Look at this. I grew these crops by taking a loan on interest. It's all charred! They gave us the seeds. They also provided the fertilizers. But I should bear the burden of the debt. We went asking for compensation... but they got us beaten up by the police. Why do you want to get humiliated as a farmer... rather work as a watchman, says my wife. I can't do it, son. I worship farming as god. I wonder what plan god has for me. -I'll take care of everything -Majority of Thamizans venture into... -Listen! -agriculture. -If the god can't save it... -Don't lose hope. I don't know who we turn to for help. Sir, these hybrid seeds are given by private companies. He has fertilized to the extent that the earth has turned hot. This will demand too much water supply. The well is all dried up. How is Velusamy managing to get water? We buy water from Chettiar's farm and water our fields. Why didn't he install a borewell. He can't afford to install a 800ft borewell that costs five lacs. Brother, how deep have you dug? We drilled 240ft, but there's not even one drop of water. In this entire district, no matter how much we drill in... you can't find water, until we dig 800ft. If you dig in 800ft, won't you hit sea water? We hit that level long back. We're happy that at least we got sea water. Whereas in Madurai and Tutucorin, the groundwater has totally dried up. -Welcome, buddy. -Hi! Why are so many left-hand-drive cars parked out here? Obviously, we've been exporting cars right from this facility. Why are cars being exported from here? If they manufacture in their own country, they can save on transportation. That's not possible. Their country has banned manufacturing cars. They banned it? In order to manufacture one car, it'll take five lac litres of water. On an average you'll need two crore litres of water per day. Two crore litres for a day? Don't be too surprised. The jeans manufacturing company uses three crore litres of water per day. The copper company at Korapallam, uses five crore litres of water. In fact these companies are way better. There's a cola company... no one knows how many litres of water that company consumes. South Africa has run out of water. So he's been selling them bottled water in dollars. If all the companies suck all the water dry... poor farmers are left in despair, with water scarcity and have been protesting for compensation. I think you're talking about Velusamy. He has no sense. Next election is not until three years. To win votes from farmers... they'll waive off loans and offer compensations. If you protest now, they won't even bother. No one forced him to take up agriculture. People should change according to time. I own thirteen acres of land. But I didn't take up agriculture. If I had, then I would've been in debt just like Velusamy. The employees at this company have quit agriculture and joined here. Only now we're leading a peaceful life. Eight hours shift. We're given uniforms. And salary gets credited on time every month. We're living a great life. Why did you ask me to get farmers' survey report? I got it because my father works at the VAO office. Take a look... until 2010, there were 7,498 farmers who took up agriculture. But now there are only 1,350 farmers left. Everyone got fed up and quit agriculture. It's not only here, the entire Tamilnadu is going through this wave. It was a huge mistake, that I never bothered to know what's happening out here. A decade ago water was available if we dig ten feet into the ground. What's the reason that it has gone to 800ft now? It's because farmers are quitting agriculture. If this streak continues... in the next thirty years India will turn drought like Somalia. What is the connection between farmers quitting agriculture... and water level going down? Hey-- The proof for groundwater are these roots. Roots are the medium for water seepage into earth. Every year we get 22,00,000 crores litres of water from Western Ghats. From which 80% of the water... gets wasted by mixing into the sea due to negligent agriculture. The rest of 20% is being used up by corporate companies. I wonder if the government is aware of these things. If they're not aware, then we should let them know. Sir, the Collector is busy in an important meeting. It'll take some time. Not an issue, I'll wait for him. Shall we play with the bell? Ring it! What is that noise? Sir, our screams didn't reach you right? You never gave an answer to our charred crops. I believe you'll answer when I'm charred to ashes. Uncle! Uncle! Whenever I saw a withered crop, I withered tired of hunger. Whenever I saw a withered crop, I withered tired of hunger. My heart aches for the poor, who are tired of hunger and not able to feed. Those who are in chronic pain, I fell asleep and was heartbroken. Poor souls as a measure of compensation... I was shaken to see the loss it incurred. Uncle. Son. Please let me die. Don't save my life. Why the hell did you do this? Don't save me and kill me again. I had no other option left to save my honor. My death will fetch my family a compensation of two lacs. To hell with money. You could've asked me for it. Taking a loan from you won't change the situation. I had enough. That doesn't mean you had to kill yourself. Your wife and your daughter are dependent on you. Did you ever think about their situation? She got married to this useless farmer. That's her sin to bear. Son, let agriculture end with me. Please make sure Meenakshi pursues her education. Please help her succeed in life. Please help her succeed in life. Uncle! Uncle. I worship farming as god. I wonder what plan god has for me. Hey, I can see the opposition party logo out there. Move our Chief's banner to that side. Come to the right. Come on, keep coming. Ask those old hags to move. Keep moving further. Fine, place it out there. Hey, move the dead body to the right. Sir, we have arrived. Where are we? At the funeral. Funeral? Turn that mirror. Move! Sir, too bad that you had to depart. Give me the garland. Vanakkam, ma! Oh, god! When I heard farmer Velusamy committed suicide... I was shocked and heartbroken. Despite the government has done a lot for the farmers... it's not fair that they commit suicide due to petty family issues. I'm saying this to all the farmers who are watching... a coward's last weapon is suicide. Don't be scared of problems. I'm here for you people. The government will always be there for you people. Be strong! Hey, where is the check? -Madam, here you go. -Ma'am come over here. Come over here and collect your check. Sister, you please leave. Why are you giving this check to her? Rather give it directly to your brother-in-law. He committed suicide only because he could not repay him. Is he the guy who is from NASA? That's right, he's from NASA. -The guy from the TV? -Exactly, that's him. Son, I can feel your pain. But you don't have to get angry. You've taken them for granted, because no one cares to get angry. Bhoomi, stop talking. Mom, I have to talk. So, let me talk. Sir, aren't you the Minister of Agriculture? You have nine additional directors of agriculture for various divisions... along with thirty one joint directors and 125 deputy directors. Moreover, you have a husbandry for each district... and a joint director for it. And 200-300 officers working under him. In total there are 12,000 officers working. I wonder why you people don't do your job? Are you there just to give compensation to the dead farmers? Mister, you're going overboard. You have no idea about anything. I believe you might even say that we killed him. That's right, you killed him! When the farmers were protesting demanding compensation... you remained inside the car, never stepped out for even a second, but you chased and got them beaten up by the Police. If at all you had just stepped out and heard their woes... he would've been alive today. Son, you're making wrong assumptions. To all the farmers... seeds, fertilizers, subsidy, -what else did we offer? -Crop insurance. Loan waivers. Crops insurance and loan waivers. The government is doing so many good things for them. Understood? Where's he going? Who gave approval for these seeds? The company requested for an approval in the morning... you've approved it the same evening. These are hybrid seeds. It's a shame that you don't know these demand huge water supply. The groundwater has sunk to 800ft. Are you not aware of that either? Son, just because you're informed, doesn't mean you can accuse the government. They migrated to these hybrid seeds, because it yielded more crops. That means, you don't care if the crops are charred and farmers die. I thought you pursued your education in America, don't you know this? If it doesn't rain, the lands will go dry. It's not a wet cloth in the laundry bucket. For it to drip water when wringing. Or am I Lord of rains? Amongst so many issues, we fought with and govt. and brought water to all the villages. There's no need for us to fight with them. Tamilnadu has received more TMC rainfall... than Karnataka and Kerala in these past ten years. What happened to that water? It got mixed into the ocean. It did not get mixed up in ocean, sir. It's being supplied to corporates. -Cut the feed, damn it. -Don't cut the feed! Isn't this a Farmer's Nation? You're the Minister of Agriculture, right? You are obligated to answer. Tell me. Hey, are you trying to grab attention? You're screaming because this farmer has died. Do you know the history? During the year, 1973... India was plagued with unemployment. Many youngsters committed suicide. Only after corporate entered, the problem of unemployment was resolved. Just because they're working in a corporate company, even an ordinary graduate... is earning handsomely up to 50,000 rupees a month. They buy car, house, phone... they can afford to eat out at the hotel They pay tax for everything. And in the name of taxes, government makes money. We use that tax money to provide subsidy to farmers. Also we can afford to compensate their death. These farmers bring loss to this country. Corporate companies bring profits to the country. Now tell me, should we or not supply water to the corporate companies? I don't know what you mean by profits. Do you think they can't manufacture cars in their own country? Or they can't manufacture the jeans in their own country? They can do it. But if they do, their groundwater will sink to 1000ft. Their rivers will turn into puddles. Their soil will get destroyed. Their people will get cancer, that's the reason they banned it. These kind of international companies just pay a rent of 3000 rupees per year, electricity on subsidized rates and gets allotted acres of land... and you give them a red carpet welcome. They come down and destroy all our natural resources. After destroying all our natural resources... they end up paying a meager amount as taxes. And you're proud of it. But farmers' problems are unimportant to you. Sir, let me tell me you a history... before independence there was no industrial culture. Just because farmers paid their taxes, the government sustained its position. Sir, India is still a nation of farmers. A farmer that owns two acres of land can make profits. I can prove that they can pay more taxes than an IT professional. Hey, let him be the last farmer who died under the pressure of debt. Let's take him. I worship farming as god. Just because you filed a petition, does that mean Govt. will compensate? I believe you might even say that we killed him. Farmers bring loss to this country. What the hell have you done, Bhoomi? NASA filed a case against you. You have to be in the United States, immediately. They're awaiting you. They're awaiting you. Mr. Bhoominathan, there's an accusation filed on you. You have exposed the secret of this project. Also, you have violated the rules of NASA. Do you accept these accusations laid on you? I agree! As he has agreed to his mistakes... please, cancel Bhoominathan's leave. Mr. Bhoominathan, you're a property of NASA. Since, you have committed the mistake first time. NASA is ready to pardon you. So, NASA has put forward a request. hereafter, you should not talk anything about farming in your country. And should not involve in any activity related to agriculture. Also, you should join NASA's mission right away. Do you accept these requests? No! He does not understand the seriousness. Mr. Bhoominathan, you don't understand the seriousness of this problem. If you refuse, you'll have to pay a hefty penalty of $20M to NASA. Moreover, you'll lose your American citizenship. Your Honor, with your permission, can I speak? Yes. When I worked at the space station... it takes 92 hours for me to get a glimpse of my country from space. My country looked beautiful from space. But that beauty remained only from afar. Only when I got closer, I understood everything. That my country is leading towards a destructive path. Your Honor, if I agree to NASA's Mars mission... I'll be the first person to set foot on Mars. I'll make my mark in history too. The entire world would've celebrate me. My dreams would've come true. But when I return from this mission... I won't have my country to live in. I don't want to lose the reality to fulfill my dreams. If this is the price I have to pay... I'm ready to go ahead with it. Thank you for the opportunity. Hey, where are you taking me? We're going to Mudumalai forest to get organic seeds. If you wanted organic seeds, I would've got it for you from our village. They're organic for namesake. It's full of chemicals and pesticides. I'm looking for seeds before the green revolution... that are potent. Do they exist now? -They exist. -Where? At a place where agriculture has not turned into business. Oh, mighty farmer! Come and cultivate the universe! To create a new world, Wake up leader, wake up! You can earn one lac per month. I have a golden idea that'll require just one acre of land. If it's one lac per month, my son will quit his job in Dubai. Let your gene be smeared with farming Show our enemies who we are Don't be afraid of becoming the sowing seed Fertilizer is the strength of your heart, please come To pour your blood as water, please come with me To strengthen the soil, let your fingers be the plough. Please come. The drought that spreads like disease, curb that with your intelligence To begin a new green revolution this moment please do come Oh, mighty farmer! Come and cultivate the universe! To create a new world, Wake up leader, wake up! Oh, mighty farmer! Come and cultivate the universe! If a youngster puts his mind, he can, decide leader, decide leader! Oh, aren’t you the greatest mind of the world? Please come. Aren’t you the angel who keeps its feet on the ground? Please do come. Aren’t you the friend who is accompanied by the five elements? Please come. Aren’t you the mother who finds happiness in feeding? Please come. Transpose the green on your nerves into the soil! Come to create a new history on this soil filled with warping worms Oh, mighty farmer! Come and cultivate the universe! To create a new world, Wake up leader, wake up! Oh, mighty farmer! Come and cultivate the universe! If a youngster puts his mind, he can, decide leader, decide leader! Farming is not a pastime The growing crops and the farmer’s life may be your plaything Your politics is not what we need When youngsters join to farm. The produce will be high We would not allow one more life to be destroyed Like medicine, law, and engineering Agricultural technology will also change Honey bees! You can do it, brother! Who sold our water to sell liquor that destroys lives? Who sold our land for erecting smoke emitting factories? We do not want free electricity We don't! We will generate electricity from natural light We will! You do not have to write-off our loans Please don't! We will work hard to repay Shall pay! Come farmer, come to rule the land Come on, mighty farmer! You are the true Thamizhan True Thamizhan rise up! Tool that you carry on your shoulder is not just to plough the land Also join hands to tear the face of our enemy Oh, mighty farmer! Come and cultivate the universe! To create a new world, Wake up leader, wake up! Today in our program, High-Achieving Thamizhan... we're going to meet NASA scientist Bhoominathan, who made agriculture possible on one acre land and still managed to pay taxes. Vanakkam! -Welcome, sir. Congratulations! -Thank you. There are many unresolved issues in agriculture... but you've raised a huge challenge. Is this possible? Sir, if an individual earns 1,25,000 per month... -are they eligible to pay taxes? -Yes, they are eligible. In five months, on just two acres of land... I made 6,22,000/- Sir, I own five acres of land. Even if we fill it with bags of fertilizers... it's really hard to even make two lacs per year. -Sir, do you know accounts? -Yes, I do. Please come over here. Sir, this is my farm. It's only two acres of land. I'm growing three types of greens on 55 cents. It fetches me 138 bunches every day. I make 39,000 rupees per month as profit from the greens alone. Then calculate how much is it for four months? -It's 1,56,000 rupees. -Note it down. I make a profit of 18,000 rupees a month from country cows. I turn the cow dung into earthworm compost. Black gold! In five months I could make three tonnes of that compost. I earned 26,000 rupees from that compost. I grew paddy on the rest of the one acre land. The paddy alone fetched me a profit of 3,00,000 rupees. Now tally the numbers... you'll get the said account. Rs.6,22,000/- For nation's well-being both the economy and ecology should go together. It shouldn't bother the environment and should also fetch income. The only profession that'll make it happen, is agriculture. Don't think you're different from a farmer. If a farmer dies under the pressure of debt, we'll die due to scarcity of water. That's the only difference. He's absolutely right. Made in Germany, Made in France, Made in USA, we've been manufacturing for the other countries. Where is Made in India? Denmark is a country that has only cow as its resource... but offers free education, free toll plaza and free medicines. Why can't we do the same when we're an agricultural nation? One lac per month from an acre of land... as stated by the NASA scientist. He has proved his theory. What else do we need? Since childhood we've been misguided in regards to education. Despite having an Engineering degree, we're still looking for jobs. Agriculture is not a wrong profession. Are you ready to pay tax by making one lac per month, just like I did? Brother, he sounds like trouble. He has messed with the Satan. His bad time has started. Wait and watch. As a first step, this Friday I'm going to conduct a seed-carnival at my farm. I'll give seeds to the 1000 farmers who will trust me on this. In next four months, they can do the same for other farmers. If that happens, in a year all the farmers in Tamilnadu will convert to organic agriculture. This is an Agricultural Nation. Support farmers! I praise thee, Mother! -This farm looks great! -Yes, indeed. My son made this with utmost care. Hey! -Oh, no, what happened? -Mom, what happened? Hey, you go and get the tractor. Brother-- Brother! -Mom, you stay right here. -Bhoomi, be careful. Brother. Hey, be careful. Go! Oh, no! Don't worry, we've arrived. Someone please get the stretcher! Come on. Be careful. Be careful. Please someone help him. -Take him inside. -Oh, no! For reasons unknown, the people who visited Bhoominathan's farm... have been admitted at the hospital because their eyes started bleeding. My eyes are burning! -Oh, no, I'm not able to take it. -Take him inside. Brother, please bear with me. Sister, please take care. Doctor-- Doctor, what is happening? We're trying our best, but can't stop the bleeding. It doesn't stop. -They're slowly turning blind. -Blind? I think it's a new kind of virus. Virus? Brother, it's nothing. Don't worry. Doctor, can you... magnifying glass. Can I have a magnifying glass? Nurse give him a magnifying glass. Sir! Sir. Doctor, can you please check on this mark? -Please check on this mark. -I'm on it. Mom. Bhoomi, a lot of Police has arrived. I'm very scared! They're going to burn down the farm. Buddy, they're not letting us inside. Ask them what is the issue? Bhoomi, don't spare them. Who are you? You should've made a mark as the first man on Mars from India. What are you doing out here? Do I look like, the person who supplied the wrong seeds and fertilizers... and the one who destroyed the lands by inducing chemicals. Do I look like the owner of Consenta company? You stated, this car company, jeans company... also the cola company, are sucking the water dry from this land, and are destroying the resources of your country. Do I look like the owner of that company too? Yes, I own that company too. My name is Richard Child. Do you brush your teeth, once you wake up? What toothpaste do you use? The names may be different. Their colors may differ too. Even the company may differ. But everything belongs to us. Which soap? Do you need soft skin? Or do you need tradition and science? Or do you need utmost trust? Everything belongs to us. Both coffee and tea belongs to us. So does ice cream and noodles. And biscuits too. Right from the medicines you use... till the oxygen you breathe. Everything in your country belongs to us. Do you know, that it all belongs to just thirteen families? These thirteen families rule the entire world. Your soil is a slave to me. It should only germinate to my hybrid seeds. It should only grow to my chemicals. It should not germinate to your organic seeds. It should not grow to your cow dung. He won't speak. One moment. -Start the show. -Okay! People, you can shoot your questions. Question. Sir, twenty six people have lost their eye-sight... what are the measures taken by the government? Answer. It's not a mistake made by the government. Note down that scientist Bhoominathan is responsible for it. The virus was spread from the farm cultured by Bhoominathan... has led to loss of eye-sight in people. I'm not saying this. The investigation report states it. Am I right? How is it possible for a virus to spread from an organic farm? Take it for instance, if the vegetables go rotten... it forms bacteria. Similarly, with the rotten vegetables... and meat, Bhoominathan created a manure. The virus has spread from it. What action is the government going to take? We have arrested, Bhoominathan. In order to stop the virus spreading from his farm... we have sealed it. We have burned it down. Bhoominathan's farming techniques... should not be followed by the people. If they still go ahead, it will be considered a crime as per law. Strict action will be taken against them. Are you getting angry? You must be angry, because your elected government is speaking nonsense. It's because your government is also a slave to me. Who should reign in power... and who should man the position, is decided by me. People's vote doesn't decide. If everyone starts to make millions by taking up agriculture... then who will come and work at my factory. Moreover, they'll start paying their taxes. Then even your government won't dance to my tunes. If everyone is given healthy food... my medicines won't sell. You're trying to create a world without me in it. I won't let that happen. If this bullet enters your brain... your life will end in a second. But... I won't let you getaway with such a small punishment. You can predict the future of your nation, right? I hate that mind. Next fifty years of your life will be inside a prison. I'll ask them to give you a TV. I'll ask them to give you newspaper everyday. Watch your country turning into another Somalia. Each and every day that you're going to be alive... "Oh, no, I'm not able to do anything about it. I'm not able to change anything." You'll regret being alive and would wish to die. That's going to be your punishment. Bye! It's better you kill me right here. If not I'll chase you away from my country. What? It's better you kill me right here. If not I'll chase you away from my country. I'm talking with the arrogance that my nation is known for. You may rule any country in this world. But I won't let you rule my country. In just one year... I'll chase you away from my country. That's why I'm warning you, better kill me right now. Hey, take him away. You're trying to create a world without me in it. I won't let that happen. Watch your country turning into another Somalia. Hey, let go of me. Wow, that's a gorgeous country! It's beautiful. But it's poor. The resources that your country needs... I'm here to give in abundance. Your country has beautiful streams and rivers. We can build a chemical company out here. A jeans manufacturing company too. Obviously, a cola company too. And for sure a copper company. We can generate employment for three lac families. And your government can collect taxes from them. We should never forget the farmers, who are our backbone. I will supply you with hybrid seeds. That'll fetch you four times the produce. The groundwater is at ten feet deep. We'll build a car manufacturing company out here. The cars you manufacture out here... can be exported to my country directly. These mountains are astounding. You can demolish these mountains and supply the concrete to many countries. And you can make millions from that deal. Hey, what are you guys doing? Initially to all the patients we give oxygen to begin the treatment. But oxygen is not agreeing with him. It's reverse and his body is agreeing to carbon dioxide. We've consulted with world's leading doctors. No one has a clue in how to proceed with the treatment. Looking at the patient's reaction, they can only hold up to five more hours. Hello! Hey, baldie. if you wish for your uncle to live, he may have to go to Mars. If he wish to live on this Earth... he'll be at Bhoominathan's mercy. Come downstairs! Hey! Stop right there. Don't shoot him. Hey, don't come close. Please step away. Don't touch him. Step aside. Don't touch him. Sir, you please come with me. Good times are upon our country. They're going to invest millions to develop our nation. Every citizen will be presented with employment opportunity. Farmers are going make five times profit. Our nation is going to grow multi-fold in industrial culture. Hello. Hello, chief. It looks like you're selling Laos to someone. I got your whereabouts from Google. All this while your slaves recited the poetry written by you. It's like writing using a pencil... the mistakes can be edited and corrected. Hereafter, everything I'm going to write... will be imprinted just like a permanent marker. Even if someone wishes it can't be erased. Neither can it be changed. I hope that country has a strong mobile network. If possible catch the live telecast. And one more thing, chief. Are you free tomorrow? It's because, our Indian law is awaiting your precious presence. Please do come! Thousands of criminals can manage to escape. But an innocent person shouldn't be punished. Four days ago, at the seed carnival conducted by scientist Bhoominathan... twenty six people lost their eye-sight due to a spread of virus. Bhoominathan or the manure he made is not responsible for the incident. Constanta insecticide company is responsible for it. The virus had spread from their insecticides. The genetically modified tomato seeds manufactured by them... consists the genes of frogs, and the banana consists of locusts' genes in them. This could be the reason for the spread of the virus. Until the investigation is completed, Consenta company will be temporarily under seal. People responsible for this heinous crime... will be arrested right away. Bhoominathan will be released, as he has not committed any crime. Sir, what the hell are you doing? Just marking my territory. Every brick of this house... I was checking, if it reeks of my money. Take a seat. Can I have a coffee? Hey! What is it? -Get me a coffee. -Okay. Sir, you have no idea, the situation I was in when I took that decision. I literally came back from the dead. Sir, do you know why they have dogs as pets? To save the owner's life when they're in trouble. But the dog in order to save its own skin... shouldn't betray its owner. Nice! Vanakkam, sir. Sir, here's the petition. Hey, serve me boneless meat, damn it. Hey! Give me water Just because you brought me to the court... don't think you've won this battle. The thought that no one can beat you... is going to be the end of you, Chief! Wait and watch. Mr. Richard Child. The virus responsible for twenty six people losing their eye-sight... originated from your company, also you have wrongly accused Bhoominathan for it. These are the allegations against your company. Do you accept these? -Your Honor-- -Hey, lawyer! Sit down. The virus originating from my company... and is responsible for people losing their eye-sight, is all fake. But I don't want to argue about it. It's your wish to believe. This is not the way to behave in the court of law! It's a contempt of court, you know. If you continue this behaviour, I'll have to get you arrested. You can't arrest me. I'm just an investor. He's the authorized signatory of the company. If you wish to, you can arrest him. Will you get arrested? Anything for you, sir. Order! Order! Few people think that the law is under their opulent thumb. They should understand that no one is above law. Mr. Pandian, get that CEO arrested right away. The company which is under temporary seal... shut it down permanently. Judge! Without me, agriculture will hit a roadblock. You don't have the source for the seeds. What will you do for your livelihood? I'll give twenty four hours to you and the Indian Government. This same court should issue an order, to reopen my company. Did you just say, you're the only source for the seeds? We have ample resources. How much do you have? Do you have a kilo or two kilos of it? I have enough to supply entire Tamilnadu. I'll play a short film, watch it. Your Honor! It was Thamizhan who taught agriculture to this world. A country with such integrity... I'm ashamed to hear a foreigner challenging us... saying that we can't do agriculture without his help. If he had challenged any other country... they might have bowed down to him. But he shouldn't have challenged the land ruled by Cherans, Cholans and Pandians. Please watch this. This is the count of all the temples in Tamilnadu. These temples not only house the deities... there's science that benefits people. Kings of those days, while building temples, built tall towers... and fixed urns on top of it. Even if the villages get destroyed due to natural disasters... agriculture shouldn't get destroyed. So, they stored seeds inside those urns fixed on top of the towers. These are very potent seeds from our country. Temples that were not anoited for more than hundred years... still have the seeds stored inside them. To retrieve these seeds, we've filed a petition on behalf of Tamilnadu Farmers Association. If you permit us, in a way that'll break sir's arrogance... please issue a strong order. We request with utmost sincerity. Your Honor, my client has an agreement with our government. You shut up! Mr. Bhoomi, your petition has been accepted by the court. You can take as much seeds as you require from the temples... I'll issue an order to the Religious and Charitable Endowments Department. What say, Chief! I retrieved my land from you. Now it will listen only to our words. Our government and the people have understood your intentions. Just like I mentioned... in just a year, I'll chase you away from my country. You should've killed me back then. You made a mistake. If I put a bounty of hundred millions on your head... your own people will kill you for the money. If I decide, in just an hour... I can change the laws of your country and reopen my companies. But I'm not going to do either of it. You celebrate this as your victory. I'll take it that I updated the OS on my phone. You're under the impression that you brought change. Mark my words! You can't change anything out here. You locked horns with me for the sake of these farmers. I'll make sure to destroy the race of farmers. And you will be responsible for that. And then you'll commit suicide. You just got a court order. The towers are too tall. Give it a try. I wonder what's the farthest you've seen the world? May be 40,000 feet in the air inside a flight. I've seen this world from a distance of 7,00,000 kms. I'm not scared of heights! You couldn't dare to stop me, when I was all alone. Now I have my people's support. Let's wait and watch, how you surpass our power! Despite orders from the court... by transgressing the heritage of temples, the seeds can't be taken... the religious groups have come down protesting in opposition to it. What will be Bhoominathan's next move? Roots have risen, you too rise high. There's no indifference between us come on join hands with us. People have come together, and made it possible. Our ancestors have said it right. Sky will abide, and the earth will applaud. Rage with anger. Seer with pride. Pour your hearts. Knocking on the door. Let the god hear us. And wad off the evil. We trust in you. The rest is in gods' hands. Our ancestors have said it right. Unexpectedly, all the people gathered at the temple, joined shoulders with Bhoominathan, and built a human pyramid, and without hurting the holiness of the temple... successfully took out the seeds from the urns on the top of the temple. Sir, our plan failed. Bhoominathan, took away all the seeds from the urns on the temple tower. Following him all the farmers are taking seeds from all temples. Hey, people who have not registered yet, please register now. Tell me, brother. I'll make a note. Consenta shares are starting to get affected. The future investment, the expansion, everything-- Christopher, do you know something. Indians are brilliant. But they are cowards. Their lifetime ambition is to graduate and work for corporates. They prefer to work continuously. If they don't have a job, they'll die. But Richard, if they start agriculture, they'll be their own CEOs They'll never become CEOs. Stop it! I said, stop it! Stop it! Hey, Raghu, what is the problem? You people are our problem! This file contains the list of people who are going to do agriculture with Bhoomi. Their kith or kin, relatives, friends, doesn't matter who they are, fire them all. As you people have stepped into agriculture... they fired us all saying that we shouldn't step into corporate companies. Hey, why did they fire you people, because we're doing agriculture? "Stop water supply to corporate companies... shut down international companies," you people are his supporters. It's obvious that they'll fire us. Race. Religion. Language. And their caste! A corporate job to them is above all of it. Let them decide for themselves. Whether they select corporate. Or they plump for agriculture. There's no point in blaming you people. In the pretense of bringing revolution and innovation in agriculture... that person has lured you people out here. He should be blamed for it. -Where is he? -Hey! I haven't lured anyone out here. You're a stooge to corporates. Don't you dare say anything ill about my hard-working farmers. Why shouldn't I speak up? I have every right to speak. They fired each and everyone related to farmers who are in support of you. He has blacklisted us everywhere. No one will hire us now. Sir, I don't have a father. I'm earning, so that my sister can pursue education. Now what do you have to say about it? Sir, I worked for twenty three years in that company. It was because of you, I was kicked out of the company. Are you happy now? Now what do I tell my children? Should I say, that I'm not capable enough to pay their school fees? Sir, our family was always oppressed due to caste. I'm the first member of family who had graduated and had a job. Today, because of you, I've lost that job. Do you expect us to go back to being slaves? Dad needs a surgery and mom has asthma, I'm left in despair now. We've been abandoned. Now where do we go from here? I'll hire you people. Will you guys work with me? Are you mocking us? I was making 1,50,000 rupees per month. Do you think you can match that number? Get on the stage, I'll answer your question. He's calling you right? Get on the stage. Explain to them in layman terms, what you did in marketing? Your job and salary is confirmed. Explain it to them. I worked as the Head of Production team. I had a team working under me. My team had to go to every shop in the city... and prepare a report for the stock of confectioneries required. We will forward the report to the production department. And they'll start producing according to it. If we hire him right now... we can fix a price of our choice for our produce. I don't understand. Last week how many of you supplied tomatoes? We all did. How much did you sell it for? I sold it for an unfair price of five rupees per kilo. -Hello, sister. -Sir. What was the price you paid recently for a kilo of tomatoes? I bought it for thirty rupees a kilo. You sold your produce for five rupees a kilo. But when the consumer bought, it was thirty rupees a kilo. Then who has been reaping the benefits of twenty five rupees? It goes to the mediator. If we remove that mediator and just employ him. We can definitely fix the price of our choice for our produce. It all sounds good and dandy. The corporate companies spend millions... on infrastructure and technology, and have employed all of them. They can afford to do it. We don't have anything. How can we afford to do it? If we stay apart we can never achieve it. But if all the farmers of Tamilnadu unite, we can do it. We can make profits up to 1,00,000 crores a year. Ten percent from those profits... let us give it to them. We can generate employment to millions of youngsters like him. He will be our Sales Head from this moment. Brother, who do you usually report to? We report to the Human Resources team. Is there a HR team in this crowd? Sir! Come on, get on the stage. Go ahead. Is there anyone from Packaging department? We need Telemarketers too. Accountants? Buddy, aren't you a supervisor? Come on, join us. I believe you're from transportation. Come on, join us. We have all the departments required to become a corporate. Shall we turn it into a huge corporate of Tamilnadu? Let's do it! Corporate against Corporate! Brilliant man! But I don't understand one thing. It'll take minimum three months to start production. They have to penetrate the market. Now that he has become a corporate. And has employed so many people. How is he going to manage to pay their salaries? And how will his employees pay their EMIs next month? They're our Indian corporates! Do you know how much they've invested in us based on trust? Five hundred crores! This is Mr. Nithin, owner of Saraswathi Company, Tirupur. His company alone has a demand of 12,000 tonnes of cotton. -Can we meet his demands? -Sure we can! This is Mr. Vijay of Nandan Food Products. His company has consistent demand for all kinds of rice and pulses. -Can we meet his demands? -Sure we can! He is Mr. Sathyanarayana. His company has a demand of 7000 tonnes of sugar to produce soft drinks. -Can we meet his demands? -Sure we can! The corporates hold just 1% of the land. But is holding our country under their tyranny. We hold 60% of the land... shall we become the tyrants who trample their tyranny? We shall do it! I praise thee, Mother! I praise thee, Mother! I praise thee, Mother! -Richard. -Hey, Christopher. Don't underestimate him. I hope you realize why he's joining hands with Indian Corporates. He's trying to prove that foreign products are unhealthy and non-organic. Can't you see he's projecting Indian products are superior and organic? History has the proof, that no one has turned fair by using fairness creams. All of us are aware of that fact. But in the past fifty years, we've sold them in large numbers. Science states that drinking cola can make a person impotent. But a man drinks that cola when he's with his girlfriend sipping on double straws. They'll speak ill about my product. They'll also post on social media boycotting my products. But at the strike of dawn, they can't live without my products. I have them right where I want them. So, what I have in mind right now... let his idea grow a little further. Do you know what our brand is called? Thamizhan! Thamizhan! We have no fear over anything We have no fear over anything Even if the sky cracks on us, we have no fear over anything Sun will guard us Uniforms will shine Let's join hands to create a new world Rain should smile, when you switch on Our paths should be paved when we say ‘BOOM’ Come my dear friend let's pull out the weeds When our man walks with pride whistles blow on all the sides Agriculture 2.0! When the shovel is picked by the hands that've never touched it, It kindles fire Agriculture 2.0! In the farming land Bluetooth is beaming with folk songs It’s so thrilling. Agriculture 2.0! Say you are a Thamizhan! Say you are a Thamizhan! Say you are a Thamizhan! Say you are a Thamizhan! Say you are a Thamizhan! Say you are a Thamizhan! Say you are a Thamizhan! We're proud Thamizhans Our heads are held high with pride We're about to conquer the world We're proud Thamizhans Our heads are held high with pride We're about to conquer the world The person who enjoyed watching you cry The one who crushed me when I fell We should explode and grow for him to look up to us Field should overflow with vegetation When zoomed, worms should be seen warping The heart should understand that It's not soil, but gold Multi-storey buildings should be blown apart to expand the farming land Agriculture 2.0! Graduated minds walking into the field, farming will flourish Agriculture 2.0! In the farming land Bluetooth is beaming with folk songs It’s so thrilling. Agriculture 2.0! Seated in an IT Company Ordering food from Swiggy War on PUBG Has faded away! Youngsters looking up at the sky with a "wow" Celebrating and dancing near the lakes Work and workout put together Freshens up the body and the mind Passion and earning come together It turns your world into a beautiful place The brains that we lent to the foreign countries Have come together to save our motherland The crowd that called us fools Have been threatened by seeing us flourish We're proud Thamizhans Our heads are held high with pride We're about to conquer the world We're proud Thamizhans Our heads are held high with pride We're about to conquer the world We're proud Thamizhans Our heads are held high with pride We're about to conquer the world We're proud Thamizhans Our heads are held high with pride We're about to conquer the world Brother, our truck has departed from Coimbatore. Kathir has gone with them. And Ashok has gone to Trichy. Vehicles have departed from all our warehouses. Only the vehicle from Tirunelveli is yet to leave. It'll depart in five minutes, Vicky is with them. Everything is going according to plan. Bhoomi, this is okay, right? Yeah, okay. You guys carry on with the work. Okay, come with me. Hey, Bhoomi! You missed me? I'm back! And guess what? Your first customer is none other than me. Very nice. The best salad I've ever had. If your people get a taste of this produce... that's it, they'll celebrate you. But... I won't let it happen. You still don't get it? Long ago there used to be a cola company I won't let him sell his cola, when I have to sell mine. I did a simple thing. I paid and bought all the bottles from the market and broke them. The cola will enter the market only when the bottles are available. Poor thing, he ordered the bottles... and by the time it reached the market, people totally forgot about the brand itself. Moreover... the people forgot about the taste of India. Your produce which you care for more than your life. Do you know what is going to happen to it? -Brother, what happened? -Boss, the trucks are on strike. Hey, what are you doing over here? The vegetables have to reach the stores by tonight. Brother, this decision was taken by the association. There's nothing we can do about it. Hey. Hey! Buddy, it's a national truck strike, today. All the trucks are standstill. We're getting calls from Coimbatore and Madurai. All the trucks are stranded. Now what do we do? Buddy, Richard is behind the hike in diesel price and truck strike. He's preventing the produce from reaching the stores. Hey, if he's an obstacle, then break him. Ask everyone who owns a tricycle or goods carrier to come over here. My call is making you tremble right? I hope you realize now who you're up against. Bhoomi, I believe you're headed to the store on the high temple street. There's a store right next to it. Shall I send you the road map to it? In 100 meters take a left turn. In 200 meters take a right turn. Your destination is on the left. Hey, I'll get down over here. You two head to Annachi's store at high temple street. Sure brother, I'll take care of it. You carry on. -You guys go. -Sure, brother. Hey, why are you guys standing still? Unload the goods and take it inside the store. The shopkeeper refused to buy our stock. You go ahead and speak to him. Brother, what is the problem? Why are you refusing to buy the stock? We've got the stock you had ordered for. Brother, step aside with me. Every refrigerator is given by him. And he's paying the electricity bill for it. He pays a rent of 10,000 rupees per month for all the displays. It cost me two millions to set up this store. The entire range of products on display are from his companies. The stock is given on seven million credit for six months. If I buy from you, he's asking me to return everything at once. I agree that we're from the same clan. I can't lock horns with him when Pongal is around the corner. Please, understand my plight. The shop display board on the outside was given by him too. He pays the electricity bill for it too. What is he saying? Oh, just because he's making money... he decided to slave himself to the foreigners who were once chased away. Hey, baldie, come outside, damn it. -Are you coming out? Or shall I-- -Hey! It's not fair, buddy. Not just this store... all the stores in Tamilnadu are refusing to buy our produce. All our men are waiting outside the stores. We worked hard for the past five months... not to just stand outside the stores. Hey, he's doing this to provoke us. If we get provoked now... -he'll win this battle. -What do we do now? Get me a hot cup of tea. Hey, what are you doing? He's preventing our produce from entering the stores. Let's turn the goods carriers into stores. Make a call to all our friends. Ask everyone to go live on social media. And tell everyone to turn the vehicles into stores just like this. And tell everyone to turn the vehicles into stores just like this. Chief, I'm very tired! You gave me a good run around. But for some reason, I really enjoyed it. Who the hell are you? You've been doing wonders. I made a mistake by underestimating your brilliance. You're the same guy right, who said, give me a seed... I'll give you a new world. You turned the vehicles into stores. Necessity is the mother of all inventions. Chief! I believe you relished our produce. Just wait for my people to get a taste of our produce. Your dictatorship will be destroyed. And the omnipotence of the people will hold their heads high. You would've grown a teeny bit of overconfidence by now. Because you've come so far. Your brilliant mind by now would've gained enough confidence to defeat me. I'm going to break your arrogance now. Bhoomi. Bhoomi. Bhoomi! I've used my last draw of powerful weapon. Do you hear any noise? Can you hear your herd of monkeys charging with their tongues wagging? I can hear it clearly. It's coming, Bhoomi. It's coming. Just like the countdown before the rocket launch. I'm going to give you a countdown now. Five. Four. Three. Two. One! I dreamt to change the face of the earth, my friend If you end up betraying me... it's not fair, my friend. It's not saddening that I lost But when our people lose... the future is lost too. Sir, you're a little late to the store. The entire stock at the store has been wiped out. I'm sure you wouldn't have seen such an offer during Pongal. If you buy a soap, you get five kilos of tomatoes free. If you buy toothpaste, three kilos of onions are free. Just for a face cream, you get five kilos of rice free. You missed an amazing offer, sir. This year Pongal is extravagant! What do I say to these tears rolling down in despair? Hey, I've been observing you. Your arrogance and pride has been shattered.. I'am looking at your defeat and your face drowned in despair. The people of your country sell their votes for a mere five thousand rupees. You never realized that your people might betray you for free goods. I'm not scared to lose! But losing to our own people... is the epitome of failure. Bhoomi, we didn't lose. Let's continue our fight. Hey! Who should I fight for? If the enemy is a stranger, I would've fought endlessly. But it's my own people who are my enemies. Then who should I fight for? I wouldn't have bothered, even if I got defeated by him. I did everything with the hope for them to win... but my people... defeated my purpose. I have no will to live, Shakti. Hey, don't speak nonsense. Hey, Bhoomi, look at me. Hey, look at me. Hear me out! Go and look outside. Look at the respect the people have given you. Go! Go and take a look. Go! I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. Hey, why are you guys burning down his stock. It's not your sole responsibility to save this nation. We too care about our nation. We bought everything yesterday to burn it today during Boghi. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother! Just because they messed with our bulls during Jallikattu issue... hope you witnessed the protest staged at Marina. Now in the name of freebies, he has hurt our honor. We can't let him slide. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. All these years to celebrate Boghi... we used to burn useless things from the house. But this Boghi we're burning down things that are useless to our nation. It's the right thing to do. Come on, brother, let's burn it all. I praise thee, Mother. Brother, you sacrificed a lot for our well-being... the least we can do is sacrifice our one month's earnings. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. Brother, Tamilnadu welcomes the expats with open arms. But we won't let you down for the sake of a foreigner. Come on, brother. Let's burn it all. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. Brother, I could only afford this much with my piggy bank. Let's prove them we're united. Brother, please burn this yourself. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. Strong are our hearts to save the land We stood with non-violence and won, shaking the world Using the zest of our minds showed the possibility of sharpening the weapons Love? Attribute like waves of the shore? Friend, our India will take care of you with the grit of a mountain! Have you seen that honor is our life? And have you known the type of our valour? Have you ever seen such unity? I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. Strong are our hearts to save the land I praise thee, Mother. Brothers’ hands are joining together! I praise thee, Mother. Despite millions of differences among us, to save our land, we will stand united If the land which sought justice for a bull is snatched, we will become the burning fire Our capability equivalent to the shore’s waves And our anger burning like a volcano Even the breeze in India will talk about it Have you seen that honor is our life? And have you known the type of our valour? Have you ever seen such unity? I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. I praise thee, Mother. Strong are our hearts to save the land I praise thee, Mother. Brothers’ hands are joining together! What'd you like to drink, sir? -Black coffee. -Just a moment please. Hey, don't be fooled that I lost. This is not over yet. Freedom was attained after a struggle for 200 years... but your people sold it in just forty seven years. I've seen bigger protests than Jallikattu. Being forgetful is your nation's disease. Is agriculture important or hydrocarbon? Is methane important or lignite? I'll keep the people of your nation pondering. You still haven't learned about our nation. Leeches like you will exist until the people realize of them as slaves. Once they come to their senses... the entire nation will come together and chase you away. You won't change. Everyday when I wake up in the morning... I'll be worried about your new schemes, to break the unity of the people of my nation. If I keep thinking about how you're going to destroy their advancement... then my mind will become your slave. Our nation is already way behind. Our neighboring countries have advanced ahead. So, I'm going to use my brilliance... for the sake of my people's development. My people have come together. And you're trying to break their unity. We don't need this, chief. So, what do you have in mind? Do you like the coffee? Do you know what is in that coffee? The *** you used to destroy my soil. I've used the same under a different combination. Just like how you turned our children autistic with your chemicals. Similarly, you'll turn autistic in moments. You offered me TV and newspaper. Now, you just stay this course... and watch our country move forward for hundred years on the TV. I remember you mentioned that only thirteen families rule this world. If any one of those families even think of ruling or enslaving my country... I'll do the same what I did to you. I praise thee, Mother!
