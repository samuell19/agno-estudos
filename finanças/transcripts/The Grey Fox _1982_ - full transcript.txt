I'm telling you, bill, with electrification coming along, there's gonna be a revolution in the American kitchen. And our company's got designs for an electric toast-making machine. And I hear stories of a... Of a stove that heats up all by itself... Just flip of the switch. What do you think of that? Yessiree, the future of houseware sales is unlimited. I feel dang lucky to be part of it. That sounds mighty fine, Mr. sims. Al... you're darn tootin', it's fine. Of course, to a man my age, the future don't mean too much unless you're only thinking about next week. Just hang on a minute there, bill, I... I wanna show you something. I'm sure I got it. Now, what do you think of that? Now, see, this... this would hook on to this... To the side of the border on top of the table or something, but... Have you got that? Here, just let me see that apple... see, now watch this. You just put it on there. - That's really something. - Isn't that something? Look at that. Yeah, what do you think of that? Fine piece of workmanship. I'll tell you, bill, this is the type of thing of the future, this idea, these kind of products, that are just gonna make your head spin. - Why don't you try one? - Oh, I'd hate to break it. Oh, you can't break this. Made to last a lifetime. That's it. Are you a... are you a sea-faring man, bill? - Pardon? - Well, I just noticed - I've never been to sea. - What kind of work - do you do, bill? - Well, I'm between jobs right now. No kidding... well, what kind of work did you do? I robbed stagecoaches. Hello, Jenny. I brought you this little gizmo from San Francisco. I guess I have aged some. This little machine peels apples real good. Come on, let's... Let's go meet Tom. - What can ya do? - I'll find work. I hear they're hiring over at the oyster beds. It'll be easier than where I've been. I know about where you been, and what you done to get there. I frankly don't have much use for your kind. Well, I hope I have a chance to soften your opinion on that. What I think about you is neither here nor there. You're Jenny's brother. You can stay, if that's what she wants. Well, this... This isn't what I had in mind, sir. I'd... I'd prefer something with a little more heft to it. - May I look at that one? - The Colt? Hm. Hey, miner. You're bill miner, right? Have we met, sir? I'm Danny young... I was in San Quentin about four years back. You remember when you got knifed by Billy Hicks... You do remember that, right? I don't remember you. I thought that you died. Well, I haven't. You're in luck, bill. I'm putting together a gang. Like Jesse James? I figure we'd do some holdups... That's your line, right? No, I, uh... I just Rob stagecoaches. You try to find one nowadays? Besides, stagecoaches, banks, stores, it's all the same. No, it's not the same. A professional always specializes. Well, yours is gone, just like a buffalo. Well, maybe I can teach you something new. How do ya plan to Rob these banks? Well, simple, all I need is four or five guys with guns and guts. Well, that... That sounds simple enough. Right... so you wanna throw in with me, right? - No, thanks. - Why not? I don't work for anybody. You're getting a little old to be choosy, ain't ya? Well, that's exactly why I have to be. - I've gotta go, sir. - Wait, wait, miner, miner... Won't you lend me a couple of dollars, huh? I know you got at least $20, $30 in your release envelope. A professional never begs. I ain't begging ya, grandpa! You give me the money. Well, uh... Maybe I... I do have something for ya. You're not worth killing, but if you come at me again, I'll put a window through your head, so help me. I apologize for this disturbance, gentlemen. I'm no oyster picker. But, I thought things were going so well. You have work, and a place with us. What will you do? Oh, I'll... Head down Portland way, and... Maybe do some prospecting. The gold rush is over, bill. It seems like I missed out on all the good opportunities. Please stay. Since my release from prison, I've... I've realized something about myself. I've gotta act on it. I'm just no good at work that's planned by other heads, and I've ambitions in me that just won't quit. Keep the engine crew ahead of ya! Check him out. Dammit. Let's get out of here! Give us his name, son. Miner. Get this lad some water. - Morning. - Hello. Is this the road to Olympia? 10 more miles will get you there. - Chew tobacco? - Thank you, sir. I feel like you been wanting some. Not the best for a man your age. I haven't got any choice... I've got a brother dying there. Couldn't walk a mile on this leg of mine. Morning, Mr. lawton. Guess you're wanting your mail? Hey, George! Hey, raring to go? Sons of bitches... they deducted me for bed and board. They even took out for apron and gloves. Hey, they really, really shave you six ways to Sunday, George. Who do you think owns this factory? That railroad owns everything, both side of the track. Looks like rain. Have ya... have ya ever been to Montreal? Who, me? - Me? - Well, listen, you know, a man can afford those luxuries if he's willing to take a few chances. Well, sure, sure. Yeah. First thing we gotta do is we gotta get you a good horse. Like a horse? I never had a horse... I don't know how - to ride a horse. - You'll learn. No worries. He'll ride. Wait till my signal, then pull ahead. Hurry up, son, bust her loose. You tell him to open that door and throw out any weapons. Open up, herb. - Is that you, nat? - Yep. Well, what's going on? I think we're being robbed. You are being robbed. Now, open the damn door, or we'll blow it off with dynamite. Do they have dynamite, nat? Most certainly do, herb. I want the register pouch. Now! Thanks. Way back. Goodnight. - Goodnight, sir. - Now, you be careful backing up. There must be more than $1,000 of real money right here. Gold dust... must be worth $5,000, $10,000. Yeah, we can buy our own railroad. Well, for the time being, we're not gonna buy anything. - What do you mean? - We'll we'd just draw attention to ourselves. We'll take some of the cash, and... Hide the rest of it. Settle down, shorty. It'll be midday before they can get men or horses to the crossing. They won't know which way we went. What do we do with this stuff? We'll bury it. Good morning, sir. Can I help you? Does Mr. Jack budd manage this hotel, son? Yes, sir. Should I get him for you? I'd be grateful. Would you tell him, uh... George Edwards is here? Yes, sir. - Hello, Jack. - Oh, yes. George Edwards. It's been a long time, but I've been expecting you. Let's have some coffee. Do they know it was me? Yeah, pinkerton guys identified you to the cpr. Seems they're still chasing you for that messy business down in Oregon. Our men failed to use the engine crew for shields. It was bad. You didn't make the same mistake in silver, did you? No, uh... we used the Chapman method there. That's... that's the only reliable way. They say you got away with 7,000 in gold dust. Well, a fraction of that. They always stretch the truth, Jack. Shorty and I need a place to lay low for a while. And what's in it for me, bill? I'm sure you'll think of something. You bet I will. The law thinks you've gone south back into Washington. I'll have to invent a cover story to explain you and your partner. I appreciate this, Jack. I see you're still working with idiots. Don't Mark shorty down... he's... He's got plenty of spunk. Good. I've got work for both of you. So. - You own this? - Yeah. Won in a card game a couple of months ago. The assay office says there's gold traces. Yeah. Louis! I don't know a thing about mining, Jack. Well you do now, been telling a story around town that you're a couple of mining engineers - up from Idaho. - So, we have to work our butts off in your mine, huh? Well, would you rather be known as a couple of train robbers? I brought you some company, Louis. This is George Edwards, and uh... That's shorty dunne. Louis colquhoun, boys. That man works in your mine? Yeah, in return for room and board at the hotel, same as you. I know that cough, Jack. He's got the consumption. Yeah, well he used to be a schoolteacher in the east. Came out here for his health. He's a good worker. Well, the... the dampness will kill him. It's a tough, old world. So, uh, you better get to work, Mr. uh... Edwards. Do you like oranges, son? I must insist that you publish it. Well, your "letters to the editor" section is supposed to be a forum for public opinion. I am the member of that public. Ms. Flynn, as I have told you already, I reserve the right to publish such letters that I deem to be of interest to our readership. Now, your letters have no interest to people around here. Mr. wilkes, I refuse to allow your editorial stand against the national women's. Trade union lead to go unopposed. It's absolutely imperative... That your readership be informed that women working in factories in this very province are being paid one-third the wages being paid to men for the very same jobs. Your editorial failed to mention that. People around here don't seem to share your passion for trade unions. Mr. wilkes, kamloops is not the planet Mars. Well, we have a transcontinental railway on the edge of town, and it brings ideas here, Mr. wilkes, hot just goods and supplies. It is the purpose of your newspaper to lead public opinion, not simply to curry its favor. I will not be told my purpose in life by somebody who obviously does not understand her own. Ah. Mr. wilkes. You have the mentality of a... Grocery clerk. Thank you. I'd like to purchase some back copies from your newspaper. Certainly, sir. Nothing wrong with her a husband couldn't fix. "Law enforcement agencies in British Columbia and the states of Washington and Oregon confirm that the search for William miner and his accomplice is concentrated on the whatcom county, Washington area, where miner is known to have resided "following his release from San Quentin." They think it was that bill miner... it's just us. I don't believe miner could have planned it any better than I did. Well, don't get me wrong, George, you do great for a nobody. There's more here, shorty. "The identity of miner's accomplice remains unknown. The train crew described this man as short, dirty, nervous, and unintelligent." Hell, I never been nervous in my life. Hello there. It's a police officer. Relax... we aren't breaking any laws. - Hello there. - Good morning, sir. You must be the men working for Jack budd. Yes, we are... This is shorty dunne, and I'm George Edwards. Guess I gave you a bit of a start back there. I guess you... you're our local law enforcement officer? That's correct... I'm corporal fernie. Mhm. You, uh... You having any luck with this old mine? Well, a few traces of zinc and lead so far. Yeah, I told Jack budd this Ridge runs the wrong direction for gold veins. But, I guess there's no reasoning with a man and his hunches. Now, that's about right. Although they've been having some success with the same type of Ridge formation down Idaho way. Yeah, Jack told me you were up from Idaho. - Where exactly? - Kellogg. Well, I was just passing by and I thought I should meet you. You'll be careful with those explosives, I hope? Oh, ves, sir... Caution makes for a longer life. That it does. Well, good day, gentlemen. Good day. You two in some kind of trouble with the law? Nope. Shorty just don't like policemen. That's all. I know a man down in cass creek... He'll pay a nice price for good horses. Well, uh... Rustling isn't my line. I'm sure you'll enjoy it a lot more than working in that mine, bill. Are ya gonna help us steal 'em? I didn't think so. You're real good at figuring out the angles, but you don't have much stomach for the risky parts, do ya? Well, that's how come I spent more time outside of prison than in it. Three-way split. You, me, and shorty. 50/50. Three ways. Take her or leave her. All right, it's a deal. When will you do it? Well, t'll uh... I'll have to have a little time to plan it out. I'll see ya. Forel I was attracted by the sound of your music. I know who you are. You're the man in the newspaper office last week. My name's George Edwards. How long have you been lurking about in those trees? Well, I... I really wasn't lurking. Isn't that "an Aria for Martha"? Mhm. You know opera? Not well, but I did attend that one a long time ago in Chicago. My name is Katherine Flynn. Well, it's a real pleasure to meet ya. Thank you. Would I be intruding if I stayed to hear your record? I suppose not. I admired the way you handled that publisher, Ms. Flynn. A lot of good it did me, Mr. Edwards. In this country, you're not taken seriously unless you're Caucasian, protestant, and, most of all, male. Well sometimes, even that ain't enough. You have a point there, Mr. Edwards. So, you left Kentucky when you were 20. - Why? - Well, it was kinda dull on the farm, and I wanted adventure. I bet you found it. Yes, I did. I was with the U.S. cavalry in the Arizona Indian wars. On the side of the oppressors, Mr. Edwards? Well, I didn't see it quite like that at the time, but, of course, I was very young and not near as wise as you. So then you went into the mining business, yes? Mhm. Odd. You don't seem like a man who'd spend his life underground. Thank you. Of course, my parents were mortified when no one asked to marry me. But I, on the contrary, was ecstatic at such good fortune. - Ecstatic? - Of course. I never wanted to be like everybody else. Well, you're certainly not. Thank you. Tomato, Mr. Edwards? I never concurred with the idea that they're poisonous. I found my passion in the art of photography. And much to my father's dismay, elected to make my own way in this world. So five years ago, I boarded a train and came west. Well, there... There isn't much out here to take pictures of. Oh, you're quite wrong, Mr. Edwards. This is a country in transition, filled with beauty. And despair. You yourself might be shocked at some of the injustices I've recorded with my camera. Well, perhaps someday you'll be kind enough to let me see your pictures. Your face has fascinating planes, Mr. Edwards. - Hmm. - You'd photograph well. Well, I'm kind of superstitious about getting my picture taken. A man who likes opera? I'm much less worldly than you think. Are you indeed? Do you remember sweet Betsy from pike? Crossed the big mountain with her lover ike. Two yoke of oxen, a big yeller dog. A tall Shanghai rooster and one spotted hog. They reached the big desert and Betsy gave out. Down on the sand lay rollin' about. Ike in great terror looked on in surprise, saying, "Betsy get up, you'll get sand in your eyes." Long ike and sweet Betsy attended a dance. Ike wore a pair of his pike county pants. That's nice. Sweet Betsy was dressed up in ribbons and rings. "Oh, ike, you're an angel, but where are your wings?" A miner come up, said, "will you dance with me?" "I will, you old horse, if you don't make too free." And I'll tell you the reason, you want to know why. "Doggone you, I'm chock-full of strong alkali." Farewell, pike county, farewell for a while. We'll come back again when we've panned out our pile. Where did you get this scar? I got knifed in a saloon. Why? The men I worked with didn't really need a reason. Where did you get this ballerina? Denver. And this? San Francisco. It flies. I apologize for asking you to do this, Ms. Flynn, particularly on Christmas morning, but I'm afraid it's necessary. Are they all dead, corporal? They're dead all right, except for the husband, of course. He took off somewhere after he did it. They hate the cold weather. Every year, ohe or two will suicide. This is the first murder I've seen here. He used a knife. He must've taken it with him. I don't see it anywhere, do you? It's a sad sight, corporal. Damn chinamen, you can never understand what's going on in their heads. Well, I wouldn't be too harsh on him. You know, they're a world away from home. Look's like he's slowing down. Look. Must've cut his throat back there. Then he run till he hit the fence. At least he saved us the bother of a trial. - Afternoon, George. - Good afternoon. Congratulations on your promotion. Thank you. That's really quite an accomplishment for a man as young as you. Thank you, George. There! Yes, the detachment is being enlarged. Hmm. I'll have two men under me. I'm sure you'll measure up to your responsibility, sergeant. It's a fascinating process. Yes, it is. Move 'em along, shorty! There's a train coming! Work train. That's the reason she was running so close behind the other. Tell you one thing, robbing trains is a hell of a lot easier than rustling horses. - Why don't we get back to that? - In the spring. Gotta work for budd all winter? Well, it's safe here in kamloops. Besides, I'm getting to where I kinda like this place. Slaving away in that mine and rustling these horses. We got all we need buried under a rock down in mission. Well, we gotta think about the future, shorty. Let's get these horses. I'm afraid you're mistaken. If miner were in this area, I'd know about it. Not necessarily. He's clever at false identities, and this region is filled with people who like to think of him as some sort of hero. My opinion stands, sir. Indeed. I take it, then, you are experienced in dealing with major criminals. No, I am not. But this is my jurisdiction, Mr. seavey, and I'm not obliged to take your word for anything here. I don't mean to condescend, sergeant, but I have pursued this particular criminal for some time now, and I know how cunning and dangerous he can be. Dangerous? That's not what I've heard. Now you're beginning to sound like one of his admirers. Not at all. But I have more important things to do than cater to the whims of an American detective agency. Your superintendent in new westminster does not agree with you. Why didn't you simply show me that in the beginning? Cooperation is preferable to coercion, sergeant. What would you like me to do? This is an accurate description of miner provided by San Quentin. Very well, I will circulate it... No, sergeant. We don't want to set him running again. I simply want you to keep an eye out for anyone who matches that description and notify new westminster if you should spot him. What is it, sergeant? Nothing. He could be any number of older men around here then. I'll wager you he is the only one with a bluebird tattooed right here. Well, I don't recall seeing such a Mark on anyone, but I will keep my eyes open for you. Not for me, sergeant. For us. We are on the same side, are we not? Move a little this way so I can see the stripes. A little more. No. Ah. There! There, that's perfect. I apologize for the rush, Ms. Flynn... But I'd like to get it off to my parents. Of course, I understand. Not every day you become a sergeant. If I catch bill miner, I'll probably be kicked up to inspector before that photograph is ready. Are you quite comfortable, sergeant? I beg your pardon? Smilel I'll have a print for you the day after tomorrow, how's that? That's fine. The, um... The pinkertons are certain that he's hiding out in this area. Maybe even right here in kamloops. Well, I certainly hope you catch him, sergeant. Now, please don't move, not an inch. Sorry, Ms. Flynn. Do you really hope I catch him? For your sake, I most certainly do. Well, a lot of people like him. It's 'cause he only steals from the railway. There, just about ready. In a way, I hope I don't have to arrest him. Might make me unpopular around here with some people. Hold still. Give me a big smile. Well, he shouldn't be difficult to recognize, not with that ballet girl tattooed on his arm. Not another word, sergeant. So he checked out of the hotel and left town, huh? Yeah, he drove off just after meeting with fernie. Well, we can quit worrying now. You must be getting soft in the head, bill. That pinkerton man wouldn't be sniffing around kamloops unless he has your scent. That's a hasty conclusion. The hell it is. It's time you moved on. I never knew you were concerned about my safety. I'm just trying to protect my own situation. Well, I can assure you, I won't do anything to harm that. Kate? Can I talk to you? In two or three days, I'm gonna be leaving kamloops for good. When we made our plans, there was something I left out. I never intended to tell ya. I'm not the man you think I am. Have you lied about your feelings for me, too? Oh, no. You mean more to me than anything, and you've gotta believe that. Are you quite sure? No matter what else you think about me. I've been thinking about it all afternoon. I've decided I'm quite sure, too. So the rest of it's of little importance. Then you know. How, Kate? Fernie. I imagine he was giving you a chance to leave before he was forced to arrest you. I went to the station and I reserved two tickets on the eastbound limited. We disembark in winnipeg. And then we make our connections to Chicago. Or New York, if you prefer. I can't go with you. Not now. It would just make it easy for the police to find me. Kate, listen. I want you on that train. You go to Chicago. Why? I'll go some place, I'll throw 'em off my trail, and when it's safe, I'll join you. You will come? You bet I will. You do believe me? I believe in you. I was looking for you a little while ago. Aw, me and Louis were just sharing a bottle at the stable. What's all this here? And what's the point, George? You ain't never gonna use it no more. No? All you wanna do is cozy up with that picture taking lady! Since when did you become an expert on the affairs of the heart, shorty? The fact is, I'd say she just about made a gelding out of you! You moronic little son of a bitch. I told you I'd tell you when the time was right. And now the time's right. Train? - How much longer? - Hour 10. - What if it don't stop? - It'll stop. They have to take on water for the upgrade. I ought go down to the 118 milepost now. Before you go, there's something I have to tell both of you. It isn't safe for me any longer in kamloops. I'm not going back, and I advise that you don't go back either. You're bill miner, aren't ya? I am. What are you two doing in here? We're robbing this train! How do you plan to go about that? Just turn out your gold. What's up, the hose bust? This is no hose bust, it's a hold up! Throw down your guns! This is a baggage car! You cut the wrong car! They all look the same in the dark! Do you have any mail? Some. I want the box, son. What box? The express box. It's on the car you left behind. The frisco pouch. It doesn't come this way, sir. Well, which way does it come? By the mission junction, sir. Is that registered mail there? Yes, sir. Put it on the table. Is that the money package? I... I don't know, sir. What do you know? Now you open it. That may come in handy. Let's go. I'm done. What about this? We don't need it now. What is it? Dynamite! Hello there. Mounties. Good day! Good day, sir. We didn't hear you when you slipped in on us. I am sergeant Wilson, north-west mounted police. I must ask you to identify yourselves. You boys are kind of out of your territory, aren't you? I must ask you to identify yourselves. I'm George Edwards, that's shorty Dunn, and this is Louis colquhoun. What are you men doing out here? Prospectin... Prospecting? Where? Over there, just east of Douglas lake. Up north? No, sir. East. You answer the descriptions of the men we're hunting. Who might they be? The train robbers, the ones who robbed the cpr at ducks sighting. Do we really look like train robbers? Those gold pans, they don't look much used to me. We're not panning, we're surveying and staking. And this is the first we've heard of any train robbery. Nonetheless, I must take you for the train robbers. - It's all up, boys. - We're done! You do that and I'll blow your head off. That was stupid. You could've been shot in the head. I wish to god I had been shot through the head. George, will you step out, please? Are my men treating you well? Just fine. Thank you, sergeant. This is Mr. seavey. He's a pinkerton agent from Portland. Hello, bill. I've been looking forward to meeting you for a long time. The name's Edwards, sir. George Edwards. Is it indeed, sir? Louis colquhoun, William Dunn, and William miner, also known as George Edwards, you have been tried and found guilty of the crime of armed robbery, and this court sentences you as follows: Louis Calhoun, 15 years. William Dunn, 25 years. And William miner, also known as George Edwards, you are sentenced to 25 years. This court is now adjourned.
