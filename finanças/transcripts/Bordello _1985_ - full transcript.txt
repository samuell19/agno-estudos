In school, I was the worst student. I used to stay away and go and catch frogs from the pool. I poked their eyes out with a pin. Then I let them loose in the kitchen. My grandfather was a clergyman. When I was sixteen, my father said... "Either you become a clergyman or you go to work in your uncle Jonathan's factory." - Factory? - Yes! Uncle Jonathan has a tanning factory. The stink of raw leather gets into your clothes. I said"I'll be a clergyman." If you were a clergyman, you wouldn't be here, would you? I ran away from home. Joined the navy. And here I am. And now? Now? Nothing. And you? My name is Emily Harvey. Ibrahim Ezat... Of the Turkish Intelligence Service. We want to be friends with everyone' signor Ezat. With everyone? Our documents have been examined by the Turkish Consul in Marseilles. I know that you have friends everywhere. Isn't it so? They were kind enough... to find us a house. That's all. I know. But beware of your friends. Besides, we are your friends. Are we not? You have not seen me. You don't know me. Right? Tamara Samoylovna Sulitsch? Rosa Bonaparte... Monsieur! The allies play their game, gentlemen. And the Turks their own. - Right? - Right. Who's going to win? - The Greeks or the Turks? - The Cretans will win, sir... Yavassoglou! Prodromos Yavassoglou. Surveyor of the English navy... Omiros Stratakis, dragoman. We must not forget, Mr. Yavassoglou, Cretans deem this island as their own. - Or is it not? - Rightly said! Now we took the bull by the horns! In politics, gentlemen, what does "mine" and "yours" mean? The Cretans say "Our island!" The Turks also say "Our island!" Merhabalar (hello), Selim Bey! Go away... We've said goodbye for ever, our paths now separate I have no one to love, I want to forget All is finished, only shadows remain Risíng up like ghosts before me Go away and forget me Our paths now separate... I have grown tired, say farewell I have no one to love, I want to forget I've grown too old, my child. Too old... He doesn't want you. The bloody fool! Do you want me? And Rosa? Rosa is done for.

Down the harbour, tomorrow morning. Look, my poiseless young lady. I'm lieutenant commander of the British fleet. Be as bawdy as you like but respect my fucking condition! Calm down, darling. Ten pounds to do it straight... Fifteen for the other way... For twenty pounds, I'll love you more than your mother ever did. My mother died the moment she gave me birth. Lucky woman! How much will you give me? Ten pounds for a straight fuck. Pay it first. Take everything off. I like to see what I'm paying for. Halt! Forward March!

Let's not play with words- signore Ezat. My only interest is money. What's yours? My only interest is Turkey, Madame! And Turkey is interested in this island. The people who meet in your house every evening are also interested in this island. And they are talking a lot. Madame BonaParte, you are right. Let us not play with words.

Do you mean you'll pay me ten pounds' signor Stratakis? Not even ten. I shall pay you a penny. When I was fifteen, signor Stratakis... I had to make up my mind what I wanted to do. As you see, I became a whore. And you? If you ask around, they'll tell you that I work for the Italian consul but I'm an agent for the Russians. If you ask the Russians they'll tell you that I'm an agent for the British. And if you ask me... I'll tell you that Ibrahim Ezat is nothing but a dirty servant Of a corrupt, rotten and dying nest of snakes! "Rahim Ezat... the Turk! Yes' the Turk. I know what he wants of you.

It's not difficult. - I don't want to know you. - All the same. You'll come to know us just as later on you'll forget us. That will satisfy all sides. Have you finished? Monsieur? Ibrahim Ezat has to do his dirty work. Don't you interfere! - And you? - I was born here. - Won't that do? - No, it won't do. Who are you working for? I already told you I was born here. In Crete. I was born in Saint Petersburg. My father was a general of the Tsar! He died in Paris, when I was 12 years old. My mother died the following year. Goodbye, monsieur. The Cretans are fighting for their freedom! Good evening to the beautiful Polish wildcat! May ! have... the honour... Of fucking you, Madam? Listen to me... A Polish woman will never be fucked by a Russian pig! Wildcat! Poland never dies! Slut! I like you that way... Well, well! Look who's here! A Greek partisan! Your hands smell of incense. Sorrow dwells in your eyes Sergei Efremovich! Vodka! I want to speak to you, captain. Go ahead. I have enough vodka... to flood... a brigade of partisans! Partisan, welcome to Rosa's whorehouse! I came to talk to you' captain. Alone. We have no need of anything And we on't pity anyone We'll go far away Happy and singing Smile, brother. Life is too short. Listen, partisan... Greek women are the best fuck. The girls from Caucasus come next. Then the Circassian women... and the Turkish women. Those here do it only for money! They feel nothing! In love, my brother partisan... Forten roubles, you take any girl you want. You strip her... You beat her... - Move now. - You kick her... Slowly! Slowly! - You spit on her... - Slowly!

The last shall be the first... The veil of the temple will be torn in two... We'll chase the merchants of the nations away... and the poorwill sit at the table of the rich. Poor Greek! If the Russians love us, let them show it... now! Speak! What do you want? Tell Captain Korsakov... That the allies are signing the remaining treaties on paper while the Turks are killing us inside our houses. I like you... Vasilis... because you're young. You're not a peasant. You are educated. That's why your people sent you. I came on my own. My people are selling us out to the foreigners. I'm a Christian... and I can understand you. You have far too many medals to understand me, captain! Freedom is not given by anyone, Vasilis! Tell your people that we love them. The wild beautiful Greek! Wait! Captain Semionov can drink a litre of vodka alone. Is he a friend of yours? No. Get in. Our home in Saint Petersburg was always full of army officers. There was a young captain... His name was Piotr Danilenko... He looked like you... He was killed in Crimea. Poor boy... He wanted to marry me... I was fourteen then. Those were the days! - Do you hate me? - Yes, probably. Why? Just because. Because I am a foreigner? Because I am a woman? Or because I am a prostitute? Because you are beautiful! Come closer to me... I like you' you like me... What else do we need? Come closer to me... Are you looking for me? Welcome to our house! This is not their house. What's he saying? He says... That this... is not our house. - Tell him to get out! - Tell him yourself! Stay! Are you afraid of us? Well- did you see that? Exactly what I said. If there will be no solution soon, we'll see these gentlemen get into our own houses! You earn your living from thewar, Mr. Yavassoglou. From the English pounds. Money knows no fatherland but I do have one! I'm Greek! Just like you! And you! And you! - It's difficult to be Greek! - Difficult but beautiful. - Long live the revolution! - Long live the Greeks! Freedom or Death! The national anthem, gentlemen! I do know thee by the direful cutting edge of thy keen sword! Crazy people! Aha- I see the hunchback is not only a hunchback. My mother believes that I'm handsome. As handsome as the archangel Gabriel. - Is she alive? - And waiting! - For what? - For me. You know what, 0miros? Last night, I had a dream, I saw that everything was covered... by snow. So much snow... I had never seen so much snow. I tried to open the door. Butte snow was... up to here. I ran to the window. I opened it. From far off I could hear the jiggling bells of a troika that was passing... down the street. Merhabalar, Selim Bey! They say the purveyors of the army make millions. Take me as an example. I have to feed 2.O0O sailors of the English ships. Let us consider cod alone. 9OO kilos of cod a week multiplied by 12 weeks equals 1O tons and 80O kilos of Norwegian cod of lower quality, packed in barrels. That is, only the cost of transportation... Oslo, Marseilles, Piraeus, Crete... 12 pounds a barrel! Add to that shipping costs, spoilage, bribes... I charge the English 43 pounds a barrel and a barrel costs me 38! What's my gain? - You mean' you have a loss? - I'm not saying that! I'm just not making a profit. Homeland! Are you Greek? Bergamo? Ayvalik? Smyrna? Omiros? Omiros? You're right... The war is over. - For you, yes. For us, no. - For you, for us... For which "you"? Who are you, Omiros? A grain of sand... lost in the limitless desert of the world... Sarah, you're right. I'm finished. Do you want me? Oh, yes, madam! Let's go then. Don't worry. It's not your fault. It's my fault. Forgive me. I don't know what happened. To tell the truth. You could be my son. I'm sorry. Don't... talk like that! Turn around! I don't like people watching at me. Get dressed. Leave the money on the table. Ten pounds. Well, signora... The partisan they call Vasilis... Met the Russian captain called Semionov. They shut themselves up to a room and talked. - I don't know what they talked about. - Find out. I Will. They spoke in Russian. The Cretans speak Russian! Very interesting. I learnt that the British ate rotten cod. Do you know anything about it? Let's get our things together and leave. Leave! I'm not going anywhere! There is money here! That's all I want! There's death here! The bloody hell... I care! To Rosa! The best fuck in Marseilles! And where will we go to be fucked? I'm not going back to Marseilles. Where then? Beirut, Damascus, Cairo... Let's clean up here first. Why are you in such a hurry? Because it is so... I'm in a hurry. Where's Kerim? My sister and her husband were killed. Why are you telling me? It was your people who did that, Kerim. Learn who did it and tell me. Tomorrow, you'll tell me. Here. Same time. 22... 23... 25... In three months! I'll have 2,000 pounds. In three months we'll be dead... Here in this filthy house! I'm going to die in my bed! Nasty, bitter hag! Bugger you! In three months, I'll be in Liverpool, in Kelvin's house, with his sister and her husband. You're lying! I started lying when I was two! At two... I don't remember anything from when I was two. But when I was six... I remember my old man naked... Stark naked on his bed... The hot days... A huge, naked body... sound asleep... Holding his prick in his hand... I stared at him... I just couldn't stop staring! I went up to him, once... Kissed... His bare, dirty feet... For me my mother was my father. My mother was as white as snow. I could see right through her hands... I could see the blue veins under her skin. She never went out of the house. She was afraid of men. I never was afraid of men. I let them fuck me! No one has ever fucked me! No one! Every time it's the first man for me. So are they! Emma is a good girl. Emma will marry lieutenant. Emma will work in uncle Jonathan's tanning factory. Blood! I keep seeing a dream... I'm spitting up blood into a white handkerchief. Seeing my blood... Same dream every time... Same blood, half black, half red... Nobody else has this kind of blood. Thick black blood! A piece of my tongue in it... I had a dream too. My husband... He was pregnant... With a huge belly! Outside this very door! I was so scared. I nearly went crazy. Not for his monstrous, disgusting belly. But for his finding me here... The end of the world... We will all die here. On this fucking island! You are angry... because you are my husband. We are a couple, aren't we? You can't scare any more. Sarah! I've betrayed you! To Ibrahim the Turk. I told him you talked to Russians in Russian. All right. Go now. For the dead. Why did you come? - Go. - Why must I go? Please, go! Do you send me away? Are you afraid of me? Hey, Mister! Kerim is... Who did it? Mustafa... Maria, !'m leaving... Won't you say anything? Did you come for us? For Carol or for Emma? For Rosa, maybe? Or for me? You like it? Take it. You bitch! What are you? Are you a woman? Do you have a body? A cunt? Have you spread your legs to a man? You witch! Witch! Witch! You were right- teacher. The war is not over. Fair Greece! Sad relic of departed worth! Immortal, though no more Though falln, great. I weep for Adonaís -he ís dead! O, weep for Adonais! Thoug hour tears thaw not the frost which binds so dear ahead Faír Greece! Sad relic of departed worth! We gentlemen, we military men, no longer play... any role in history, We're pawns in the hands of the politicians! Tomorrow's war, gentlemen... will be waged by the diplomats, We are puppets without will! So to us! Gentlemen, we've been the makers of history. We are the last soldiers. Hello, handsome! Let's do it. Come on, let's do it! Everyone talks here. And you, Mr. Yavassoglou... you talk too much. Let's go! So I talk too much, Ibrahim Bey? Two sailors on an English ship died from rotten cod. Have you heard anything- Mr. Yavassoglou? Jesus Christ! My partisan friend! Vasilis... brother... Welcome! Drink! Thank you, captain. I never drink. Drink! Come on! To your health or mine... Now, you'll drink. Drink. You can't say no. To Tsar! To Tsar's death! Listen, partisan! Tsars never die! The one is born into the other. People like you... end up on the gallows. You'll die young. I can see that here... You've got the mark. Drink... Come with me You're alone? Where are your fellows? They left you on your own tonight? You're the best of all of us. Look at them! Just look at them! The perfect picture of despair! The partisan and the whore! !'m going to steal the Greek from you tonight. He pleases me. That stubborn mouth... Neck... The chest... That's a fine figure of a lad. Like flames of the fire. That's what revolution is- The flames of the fire! The flames of the fire... I'll bring up our son to be an officer. Just like you. May God protect Captain Mason! The fire that on my bosom preys is lone as some volcanic ísle Listen, Greeks. There are two kinds of freedom. Freedom of others and your own freedom. But the others', you can do something. But for your own freedom... nothing! Kill them! Captain Semionov, the monster! First offer! One hundred pounds! From the officers of the British fleet... to the beautiful lady who dares to make love to the monster! Come on, ladies! Be bold! Me! Come to me! More tightly! Hold more tightly! Don't speak! Don't say anything... Sergeant! I'm sorry, sir. But I'm afraid that you lost. Vasilis! My beloved! Please, don't die! Vasilis! I beg you! Captain Semionov? Look! The party is over! Fire and water... The beginning... Omiros? Omiros? Please... Find me a house by the harbour. I want to see the ships from my window. My house has a large window that looks unto the sea. I've got chickens... I have a dog... Thirteen whores! Bad luck! I knew it from the beginning. Sarah? Sarah? Where is Sarah? Sarah! Sarah? Sarah? Sarah! Rosa is finished! Let's go to Beirut! Who is coming with me? Me! Me... Me! Sunlight... About face! Fire! Ready! Aim! - Fire! - Freedom! You! Little shit! Fucking butcher! You know something, Omiros? I've never been in Saint Petersburg... I've never walked on the snow of Saint Petersburg... I've never heard the troika bells of Saint Petersburg... I was born in a small village near Odessa. My father was a poor tailor, a good tailor...
