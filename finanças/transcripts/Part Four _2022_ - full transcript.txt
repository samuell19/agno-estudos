Imran Aziz wasn't killed because of his relationship with Anjuli. We should look at his business dealings. Ma'am, it's her. I believe Imran Aziz and Anjuli Kapoor's deaths are linked. The man you are looking for is Magnus Tranter. How did you meet him? We got chatting in the pub. It was just sex. After that night, I never saw him again. ABC. Accept nothing. Believe nobody. Check everything. I was working late, so I thought it'd just be easier to stop at mine. You shouldn't be going back there, Rach, it's not safe. I worry about you being there alone. Me and his mum aren't together. She's a good kid. Life's short, you know, you only get one shot. OK, you were right, do it. GUNSHOTS HE EXHALES SHARPLY MUFFLED POLICE CHATTER Ma'am? Ma'am, can you hear me? It's Carly. They're moving PS Khatri's body now, ma'am. I'm really sorry, ma'am, I need to get your clothes for forensics. DOOR OPENS Hello, Rachita. Sir. DOOR CLOSES, HE SIGHS For the purposes of the tape, this is Superintendent Beardsmore interviewing DI Rachita Ray, on Monday 22nd November. Also present is DS Lewis Kay. Thank you for taking the time to speak to us, DI Ray. I'd like to begin by going through some of the basic details leading up to the incident. It was 20:30, I was about to have an early night, been a long day. Ah, in what way? We'd witnessed the hit-and-run of a significant witness, and I'd interviewed a trafficked teenager who had come out of a coma after just having lost his father. Why did PS Khatri come over? He brought food... fish and chips. Actually, it was veggie patty and chips. He knew I hadn't eaten all day. How long did he stay? We had a short conversation at the door, and then he came in briefly. In that time, I had put the food down and took a phone call. From who? DCI Hunter. You and he are engaged, I believe. Yeah, we are. Did you inform DCI Hunter that DS Khatri was at your house? No. He wasn't stopping. When PS Khatri left your house, can you tell me what you saw? He was, erm, saying goodbye. And after he was shot and fell on me... ..I saw two men passing by on a motorbike. One of the... The passenger was holding a firearm, it just all happened so quick. I believe one of the men was Tranter, it must've been. Would it be fair to say that Tranter was more likely to come to your house in search of yourself and not PS Khatri? Yeah, I think so. Officers are speaking to your neighbours and sourcing any CCTV they may have in addition to the street CCTV. They, of course, have the footage from your doorbell camera. Right, OK, interview terminated 10:05am. What concerns me, DI Ray, is that you seem totally oblivious to the fact that you were being watched, and as a result, we've lost an officer. DOOR CLOSES You know, I would've sat in. Oh, it's OK. What did he say, moving forward? They're putting me in a hotel. I'm supposed to keep a low profile. And I'm to use this from now on. Do you want me to come to the hotel with you? I'm not supposed to tell people where it is. Don't be daft, it's me. I thought we were supposed to keep things on the quiet at work? What were you doing back there, Rach? I said you could stay at mine indefinitely. I just wanted to be in my own bed for a couple of nights, you know, in my own space with my own stuff, check on my tomato plant. It's a bit late, though. Looked pretty knackered. CAR LOCK BEEPS How did he know you'd be there? Tranter? No, PS Khatri. He, erm, asked me if I wanted to go to his mate's chippy, and I told him I needed to go back home and pack more stuff. It's a bit weird, though, isn't it? Guy you hardly know suddenly turns up, unannounced, at the house you're not even supposed to be staying at. He was being kind. You know how hard this investigation's been. I've gotta get back. Be careful, Rach. Drive safe, yeah? I'll call you later. SHE SNIFFS This is DI Ray. I need to come in, it's urgent. I watched my colleague die, on my doorstep. SIGHS I know, I heard. I'm very sorry. I don't wanna compromise your investigation, but I believe the man responsible is Magnus Tranter. In fact, I'm pretty sure of it. DI Ray, I understand Tranter is your main focus. Unfortunately, for us, he's just a mere foot soldier, one of many. We're trying to crack one of the largest smuggling networks in the UK. We have the opportunity here to cut the supply of drugs to the Midlands by 50%. OK. But surely, if we obtain intelligence that affects your case, we can work together to bring him in. This man murdered a police officer. I want a meeting with the controller of Imran Aziz's handler. I believe they can help me without your investigation being jeopardised. OK. I'll speak to those higher up. Thank you. West Central Police were called to an address in Birmingham. CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICK That is where we found PS Khatri. Serious Crime have commenced a further investigation. We do not, at this stage, understand the motive for this attack. CONTINUES ON TV: 'I can assure you, 'whoever is responsible will be brought to justice, 'for the family of PS Khatri as well as his fellow officers.' I hope Major Crime through everything at it. Ma'am. How're you getting on? Ma'am, been doing background checks on Laura Milne and her link to Tranter. Right, and...? Managed to get hold of the kids' birth certificates. They've got different dads. One is a Neil Grant, and the other... Magnus Tranter. So he wasn't just a fuck buddy. Mm-hm. I wanna know why she lied to us. Me too, ma'am. Hello? Laura? Up here, ma'am! Shit. Looks like she left here in a hurry. Hold on. Get down to Greystone Junior School, the address is on some letters on the fridge. I wanna know if they have any other addresses on record for where Laura and the kids might be. I want a section nine. Cover all bases. Ma'am. What's happening? Head teacher reported they stayed at this address for a few weeks a while back. It was only temporary, but he saw a man matching Tranter's description at school pick-up. Armed police! There! DOOR CLANGS There's nobody here, ma'am. There's no-one here, ma'am. Control, entry gained. No persons found. Armed officers... Nothing yet, boss. Could you see how Liam's doing tracking Laura Milne's phone and card? Will do. In the meantime, if we keep looking. No sign of kids being here. No clothes, toys, kids' snacks. There's no sign of any personal items. What does he do here? Hm, that's not the comfiest. No, doesn't look it. Help me tip this over. HE WHISTLES Proper treasure chest. Sri Lanka? Well, that's definitely not him. Sumaira Kumara. What's he got this for? Let's get a search team in to itemise all the evidence. SIREN WAILS IN DISTANCE Ma'am, a mate of mine works at Elton Road Station. He's one of the DSs on the investigation into PS Khatri's murder. Right. The ballistics report came back. They don't match any registered weapon. Thought you should know, ma'am. Thank you. Here. Oh, oh, what about you? I have another two in the kitchen. RAAG MUSIC PLAYS PHONE BUZZES SHE SOBS PHONE BUZZES Clive. 'Laura Milne's card was used to withdraw Â£200 from a cashpoint 'at Grand Central Station 15 minutes ago.' I'm on my way. FAINT CHATTER, TANNOY ECHOES IN DISTANCE Police! Open the gate! 'Doors closing.' TANNOY: 'The 15:35 Cross Country service to Edinburgh 'will depart from platform number seven.' Can you get them to hold the train on platform seven? Police! Laura Milne, I'm arresting you on suspicion of assisting an offender. Where are my kids? They're fine. My colleague is with them while we wait for social services. Why did you lie to us about your involvement with Magnus Tranter? I don't wanna get involved with any of his business. I got pregnant by accident. I didn't think he'd want anything to do with Milo. I don't ask him for anything, he just drops cash round sometimes, or stuff. That's it. Where were you headed? My mum's in Edinburgh, I needed a break. Kids were riled up after you lot come round. Why the hurry? I got stressed. I don't wanna be dragged into anything. Laura, do you have a current phone number for Magnus? He only ever calls on withheld. Or doesn't call and just shows up. He's always got a different phone. That's just the way it is. VIDEO GAME BEEPS Your mummy won't be long. RINGTONE BEEPS Don't you wanna answer it? RINGTONE BEEPS Who's calling you, Milo? Why don't you wanna answer? All right, Milo, you're not in trouble, but I'm gonna have to take that from you, OK? Just pass it here. It's OK. Milo receives a lot of calls for a nine-year-old. That's only for games, nobody knows the number. Except his dad. SHE EXHALES We need to get this phone number traced asap. Boss. SHE EXHALES SHARPLY Carly? How're we getting on with tracking Tranter's phone? Liam's working on it, ma'am. OK, great. I wanna check the tape that we found with the passport at Tranter's address. Forensics checked it for fingerprints and DNA, they got nothing, ma'am. Tech has just got us a working copy of the original, it's in evidence. Has anyone watched it? Awaiting clearance from yourself, ma'am. Great. What's the date on it? Erm... March 2007, time 23:05. Ma'am. Thanks, Carly. D'you know what? PC Knott has got some evidence files for me that I completely forgot to pick up. You couldn't go and grab them for me, could you? Of course, ma'am. Thanks, Carly. SHE EXHALES SHARPLY SHE GASPS AND PANTS SHE SOBS PHONE BUZZES Shit. Yeah, hello, this is DI Ray from Homicide. Could I speak to someone from Vice regarding some historic investigations I'm doing? Yeah, great, thanks. I'm interested in cases from 2007 related to sex workers. Ray? I heard about Tranter's phone being IDed. Good work. Whatever you're doing, it can wait until tomorrow. Go home and get some rest. We're getting closer to bringing him in, ma'am. You should be working with your team. I'm going to insist, as Superintendent, you take some time off. Intelligence have passed information to me directly. It is vital to our case, ma'am. Good. I need to hear it. But you can brief the whole team in the morning. PHONE BUZZES Glass of wine? No, ta. Looks like you need it. I'm sorry I didn't pick up before. I needed some time. I think everything just hit me. It's OK. Sure you don't want a drink? Mm-mm. Can I, er... talk to you off the record? Of course. OK. So, I've hit a flag pursuing Tranter. What kind of flag? Intelligence have him under surveillance. Shit. Imran Aziz was informing. I believe that's what got him killed. I asked for a meeting with the controller, but it's a longstanding operation. So, it sounds like you should stay out of it, Rach. Yeah, but I don't want to. Well, no, of course you don't. But if there is a major intelligence operation going on here, then the last thing that you want is to screw it up. Then the shit'll really hit the fan. For you, I mean. I'm sorry, I know it's... it's not what you wanna hear. But I'm just trying to help you out here. I know. Er, you're right. Thank you. 'Thank you, all, for coming in.' I have important information to share with you all. I've been in contact with Intelligence. They've been watching our suspect, Magnus Tranter. They're actually the ones who positively identified him for me. I'm sorry I didn't brief you all properly before, but I've been avoiding a blue-on-blue incident. I'm sure you understand. What's Tranter's deal, then? He's the subject of an ongoing covert operation into a huge drug-smuggling outfit. More than just the fentanyl they were importing through Imran Aziz's cash-and-carry. Also, the largest quantities of cocaine and heroin they've seen in years. Their investigation is focused on drugs. I'm more concerned about the murders of PS Tony Khatri, Imran Aziz, Anjuli Kapoor and Karl Shaw, as well as the people-smuggling outfit. It's likely this group have been involved in this activity for a number of years, reaching beyond Vietnam into bordering countries. I've given DI Ray my backing to continue with relevant searches, including any premises relating to Tranter and any associates, so you can bring them in. But we need to ensure we don't end up trampling on the ongoing covert investigation. I've assured Intelligence that won't happen. And we're to report any significant findings to them. DI Ray's right. Everyone's looking for the same group of people here. Why haven't we managed to track down Tranter's phone yet? Ma'am, Tranter's phone's gone offline. We're analysing call data to see if we can track his location through his associates instead. Thank you. Please keep me informed, Liam. Ma'am. What about this Sri Lankan girl's passport and the tape that was found? It seems she may have been another trafficked worker. I've asked Carly to ID her. What I need from you now is to step up tracking down Tranter and bringing him in. Can you widen the distribution of CCTV images to include more constabularies, please, Clive? Ma'am. Ma'am. Sumaira Kumara is registered as paying council tax. She also has a full, clean driver's licence and is co-owner of a fully registered business. She and her husband run a mobile cleaning company called Clean Scour. So she didn't change her name, then? No, ma'am. Coffee? Er, yes, black, please, ma'am. Why would she, I suppose? She doesn't have a criminal record. I need to tell you why I kept the contents of the tape from you. You didn't say anything to the others, did you? No, ma'am. Good, cos I need your discretion, Carly. There's got to be a reason why her passport is with that tape. I believe there's a strong possibility that she is the woman in that... footage. I checked with Vice. A week before the date on the recording, there was an attempted armed robbery in a brothel in Digbeth. The police intercepted it. I believe the man in the footage is one of the investigating police officers, and that he may have links to Tranter's organised crime group. I haven't put the copy Tech got us into evidence yet, but, um... I think I may need to escalate it further up. But can I ask you to trust me with this, and not share anything with the others just yet? Sumaira was 15 at the time. SHE PRESSES DOOR BUZZER It's the police. Can you open the door, please? Hi, there. My name is Detective Inspector Rachita Ray. This is my colleague, Detective Constable Carly Lake. What's this about, please? We're looking for a Sumaira Kumara. That's you, I believe. Uh-huh. Is it OK if we come inside, Sumaira? Thank you. Sumaira, I was wondering if there was something you could help us with. I believe you worked in a brothel in Digbeth? That was a LONG time ago. I understand. But I'm sure you can remember the armed robbery that took place there. Must've been frightening. I have to get to work. I know you were trafficked. I want to make sure this stops happening to others. The police intercepted the robbery, didn't they? Can you remember anything about the police officers who helped you? No. DC Lake, the photos, please. That's you, isn't it, Sumaira? Did you have sex with one of the police officers who helped you? We know you were underage. Did he force himself on you? It's a criminal offence to have sex with a minor, and we can deal with it. It doesn't matter that he's a policeman. No. It wasn't like that. Then can you please tell me what happened? My bosses saw that he liked me. They told me if I had sex with him, I didn't have to work there again, and they would give me money and return my passport to me. I didn't want to be a prisoner any more. Do you recognise this man? Sumaira, please... help us. SHE EXHALES He was one of my bosses. Clive, it's Rachita. I need you to do something for me. Put out a call for any patrols in the Harborne area. I need them to swing past an address, but... make it look like an average patrol, no fuss, no getting out of the car. I'll text you the address and the postcode now. 'Ma'am.' Cheers, Clive. PHONE BUZZES Ma'am? Er... Sorry, Carly. Let's take her to the station while we arrange for a safe house. I have to head to a meeting. Ma'am. SHE SIGHS TRAIN PASSING OUTSIDE KNOCK ON DOOR Well... this is romantic. The fuck are you doing here, Martyn? Where's the controller? Where's the copy of the tape, Ray? What tape? I know you've seen it. It went into evidence. It did. So my copy isn't gonna stop it blowing your cover. You think I'm the only copper they've got in their pocket? They've already mopped up the original. They wanna protect their asset. It's their leverage over me. Yours is the only copy left. Now give it to me. Did you tell Tranter that Imran was informing about the drugs and people-smuggling? I'll ask again. Where is the copy of the tape? How did you know I'd be here? To be honest, it was easy to lure you here. You told me how desperate you were to look into a meeting with the controller as soon as you could. So, who's been watching me? You or Tranter? He reported everything back to me. Didn't think Tony was your type. You took advantage of a young, vulnerable woman. A child. They set me up. They told me she was 19. Then they showed me her passport. And they made it very clear that I had to make the investigation into the raid go away, or they would release that tape to my superiors. I didn't have a choice. I-I had to keep working with them. So you got Imran killed? HE EXHALES Why Anjuli? You know those bullets were meant for me and not Tony. I warned them Imran was informing against them so that they could scare him off, not kill him. Or her. And then, after that... ..it got complicated. Now I'm gonna need that tape. I suppose it was the easiest thing to do, though, right? People already have preconceived ideas and stereotypes about Asian crime, so it just... worked. I never banked on you becoming DI on the case. That fucked everything. I had no choice. I had to try to steer the investigation. You've known everything the whole time! They've been a step ahead because of you. You were prepared to let two innocent lads go down for murder. You can't prove any of this. Give me the tape. The quicker you hand over the tape, the quicker we'll get this over with. Martyn, please... You don't have to do this. Please. Come on. She's all yours. Hello, Rach. You can have the tape. I won't say anything. I don't believe you. You're too straight for that. Martyn, please! I'm sorry, Rach, but I know you. Get in the car. SIRENS APPROACH TYRES SCREECH Armed police! Armed police, show me your hands! Step away from the vehicle. On the ground, now! Hands above your head! All clear? Clear! Magnus Tranter. I am arresting you for the murders of PS Tony Khatri, Imran Aziz, Anjuli Kapoor and Karl Shaw. DCI Hunter. I'm arresting you for suspicion of perverting the course of justice, malfeasance in a public office, conspiracy to cause GBH... Let's go! Get off. ..conspiracy to attempt murder... and sexual activity with a minor. You do not have to say anything, but it may harm your defence if you do not mention, when questioned, something you later rely on in court. Anything you do say may be given in evidence. ABC. Accept nothing, believe nobody... ..check everything. BEARDSMORE: Are you willing to provide us with the names of the group you were working with? Those in possession of the footage? Is this the phone you've been using to communicate with Magnus Tranter? Is it also the phone you used to inform Magnus Tranter that DI Ray would be at the hotel with you? Your fiancee, DI Ray. She discovered your links to Magnus Tranter, didn't she? So, off the record, she expressed her frustration that Intelligence were refusing a meeting with the controller of Imran Aziz's handler. She had reason to believe that you would intercept her and find out what exactly she knew about Tranter, his associates, and their link to Imran Aziz. You've been obstructing our investigation at every stage, passing on information to organised crime. Am I right, DCI Hunter? I want protection. The backup team followed you and Tranter to the hotel, where you lured your fiancee. DI Ray set a trap. And you fell for it. Hello, Mrs Kapoor. I'm not here to ask any questions. I just wanted to pay my respects. And to apologise. For everything. The way you and your family were treated. And I'm... I'm so sorry about Anjuli. MRS KAPOOR SOBS This shouldn't happen. A gift, for your family. SHE SPEAKS IN PUNJABI The washing machine spin cycle was so loud you couldn't hear it! LAUGHTER What are you doing that for?! LAUGHTER You got the last one. I'll buy. You take the tray. Boss. You must be feeling relieved. You still going in to see Beardsmore tomorrow? Yep. Good. Cos when he makes you DCI... I can have your job. Keep dreaming, mate! LAUGHTER ALL CHATTING AND LAUGHING Hey, loving this boozer, boss. A friend of mine introduced me to it. Ah, to Tony. To PS Tony Khatri. We've arrested a major player and uncovered a corrupt officer, thanks to your efforts. However, you've been having a relationship with an officer who we now know to be deeply corrupt. On those grounds alone, you will need to be investigated. I fully understand, sir. I feel confident you'll find no wrongdoing on my part. My only regret is that I didn't immediately report the tape to Anti-corruption. However, in my defence, I needed to use it as bait to capture both DCI Hunter and Magnus Tranter. Once I had knowledge of DCI Hunter's corrupt connections, I wasn't sure who I should share it with. We haven't yet addressed your interpersonal issues with management, as well as the allegation of bullying. I admit at times I may have acted in haste, but it was always out of the need to ensure public safety, sir. As for the allegation, I'm sorry if PC Knott thought I was bullying her. That was absolutely not my intention. My concern now is that the big players are still out there. We appreciate that is a concern. We'll have a new team on it. But this is my investigation, sir. You tasked me to solve a murder. I did that. I found Imran and Anjuli's killer, I uncovered a corrupt officer, and in the process, my team have made a start in unravelling a modern slavery ring operating here. I have more than proven myself, and I still have work to do. Part of this is on us. I'm afraid we failed you, Ray. I was under pressure to appoint you, due to the ethnic needs of the case, but as a result, we put you in a position where you were out of your depth. You simply weren't ready. I know... and you know... what this is really about. I'm awaiting the authority of the ACC to suspend you, pending further investigation. I have to be at a meeting. DCI Henderson will brief you on the protocol leading up to your investigation. He never wanted me in the first place, did he? And neither did you. I disagree with him, though. You were ready.
