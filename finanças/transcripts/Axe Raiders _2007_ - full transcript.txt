(water splashes) (drum beats) (epic music) - [Eric] Sailed from shore. Ship from storms. I sought and slayed my kin's killer. Avenges in anger. Eric's axe. Sail fouly on Eric's force. Cruel cleft. Fengal's naked neck. Claimed his land, Woden's wart. (epic music) (swords clank) (warriors yell) (sword slices loudly) (Eric yells) (epic music) (dramatic music) (thundering footsteps) (dramatic music) (men yell) - I, hatch runes on me axe staff. Those fell, spelt with blood. Can they name notched next on the wild ox horn, I'll drink from. (men scream) (arrow thuds) Let your arrows cut the air. My axe has split Fengal's skull. Yeah! (men yell) It's a fair days' work. (men yell) - I swear to God, I will kill you with your own axe. (Eric laughs) - Hear that, lads? The Celts have only got wenches left to do their fighting for them. (men laugh) (dramatic music) (men laugh) (oars splash in water) (dramatic music) - You were my father's retainer, Domlin. Swear to me in the bonds of St. Andrew that you will help me avenge him. - You're a crazy girl, Ethne. - Swear. - Ah. I swear. - Thank God for that. - You're gonna get me hung. If you want to be a warrior, then you have to start eating meat. Come. (birds chirp) (dramatic music) - Aren't you gonna send a ship after them? - Fengal killed Eric's twin brother, Eida. By their law, he had the right to revenge. - We don't live by their laws, Tadwell. They're our sworn enemies. - Your father lives in the past, Ethne. We must make peace with the Angles. However, this is no land for a young woman to flourish. I'm sending you away. - I'm not going anywhere. - You know Roderick's agreed to marry King Emir's daughter. She won't want you in her household. - So you want rid of me? - No, Ethne. I just don't want you to grow up like your aunt, Melangal. (birds call) Garich has agreed to teach you in a school in Glendt. - What's wrong with Mongel's school In Glasgow? - He doesn't teach girls. - Shut up, Tadwell. Why won't you avenge my father? - Enough of this. Young King Meric will make a good husband for you. Defenwol will escort you there in the morning. - That witch and Yee's son. No way, I'm not marrying anyone. - He will make you a queen. You will bare Coulhen children, not common stock like your father. You know, he never cared for your mother (laughs). - This is a bad business. We're being lied to. (orchestral music) - I'm glad I've arranged for you to marry my second cousin. It will be good for appearances to have a woman on your arm. - I don't much care for appearances, Tadwell. I am what I am. - And I, Roderick, but the world is not so open yet. Oh come, Roderick, you're cold with me. Kiss me. - What are you so cheerful about? - In the name of peace, I've sold some of my land to those Anglo raiders. - You traitor! - This country, Roderick, has been made penniless by the civil war. Your own lands are ruined. Look at how you live. If we have to sell some land to make it whole again, then it is a price worth paying. - By trading with the Angles? - Yes. Otherwise, they will overrun us. - Perhaps having Fengal killed wasn't such a good idea after all. - We're rid of him. The time has come to move on. - You're right, Fengal was a thorn in my side. - Exactly. He had a hand in my father's death. So in law, I had some right to avenge just like Eric. - I can't deny that. - You're about to be made king. You need to think like a king. Besides, you had no love for Fengal. He deserted your daughter with a child and went off to war for how many years? - Eight. - Came back and brought another wife with him. There should be a law against that, Roderick. - Shut up, Tadwell. Thanks to you, we no longer have a champion. And this country lives in fear of Eric the Axe! - Perhaps. But if you hunt him down, you'll be the saviour of Strathglide. - I'm not going after that madman. - I'll organise it. With the help of that ox, Defenwol. That is, if the terms are right. - Are you bargaining with me? - Eric's made for the lands I sold him. Knowing where he is, that's got to be worth something. - What? (birds chirp) - Your daughter. - Melengal (laughs)? You must be mad. - Oh, she has a comely form despite her curses. - She's older than you. You find that attractive? - No, course not, but you are marrying and I feel that I should marry also. - She's a pain in the neck and she has her own Defenwol. Defenwol is a big ape. Can you really imagine him as your son-in-law? - He is loyal, Tadwell. - Loyalty comes at a price, Roderick. Mine is Eric's head in exchange for Melengal. - You don't know what she's like. At 12, we sent her to a house of virgins in Erin. She climbed up on the rampart walls and consorted with a thatcher. It was a scandal! Now no one wants her or will have her. - You leave her to me. Believe me, after a week on a serf's farm, she'll be grateful to marry me. (orchestral music) - Fengal was opposed to Roderick making himself king. Now Fengal's dead. - Are you saying Roderick had my father killed? - He had reason to. (laughs) Fengal would have challenged him. Now there's no one left to oppose Roderick except for Tadwell. - Tadwell's loyal to grandfather. - Not as loyal as you think. Tadwell plans to get rid of both of us by getting Roderick to marry his Irish cousin. - That's just plain silly. - Is it? We're the last of the great Conaris blood carried through the female line. Whoever marries one of us will become king of Strathglide. The old fool should relinquish power. Getting married at his age and to Langrith O'Neal (laughs) his last plot. - What's wrong with her? - What's right with her? She's capricious, selfish, she's an absolute trollope. Her father's glad to be rid of her. She tried to poison him. - Really? - Roderick intends to disinherit us by having a Malesian child to Langrith. - Malesian? - The royal land of the High Kings of Tara. We're Britons, not Irish. (laughs) Power's going to his head. I hope she gets captured by the Angles on her voyage from Erin. Where did you get that? - Found it. Do you know what it is? - (laughs) It's the bride of Christ. You better not let a priest catch you with that. You'll be denounced a pagan and walled up in some godforsaken chapel. (orchestral music) - Eric's camped. First ship appears on a loch two day's march from here. - What are you doing? - I'm not waiting to be sent off to Gwent tomorrow. - The Angles will kill you! - [Man] El's worth 10 Angles. - And a Celt's 10 times more treacherous. Do you think Roderick's going to just let you slip off? He's got guards posted everywhere. - I've taken care of that. (violin music) - Defenwol? (laughs) Oh, when he wakes up, I don't want to be the subject of a sore head. I'm coming with you. - Not dressed like that, you're not. - Oh. I'll meet you at Connedis Stone. - You have 'til dawn. (door shuts) - You're an imbecile, Defenwol! Ah. I want them found! - Roderick, I caught this shrew on the road. She tried to steal my sword. My ears are still burning with her curses. - You've been a vixen since the day you were born! - You're not my father. No father would treat his children as you do. - Don't you speak to the governor like that. - Ah! - You will learn humility. I'm having you bonded to one of my tenant farmers. - You can't bond me, I'm royal born. - [Roderick] That's what you think. - Go on, carry out the order, Defenwol. - Don't do it, Defenwol. He's trying to disinherit me. - Put her in rough cloth. I want her tenanted with the ugliest man you can find. She's to cook and wash for him. She's to be, in all matters, his bond servant. And find that runaway girl while you're at it. - Aye. - That Langrith O'Neal is a curse on us all. - Be quiet, Melengal. I've had enough trouble as it is. - (sighs) She's not coming. Let's go. - Can we not wait a while? I'm tired. - When warriors tyre, they usually die. (horn music) Defenwol! (dramatic music) - It's Angles we should be chasing, not Fengal's daughter. She doesn't want to marry Mulic. That should be the end of the matter. - Aye. - The old sod's gone mad. Now let's get back before Melengal trips from a rope. (dramatic music) - Where are we going, Domlin? - I know a few friendly Picts that might help make up our numbers. (dramatic music) - [Ethne] What is it? - I don't know. - Ah! - Hold there. Who are you? - (laughs) Some call me Lae Lokin, but I'm a Drin, bard of Gwindaloo. Oh now, one worth of his name. - The wizard Midrin. - Lower your arrow. We mean no harm. You look hungry. Let's eat. (chime music) - Hmm. I'm suffering in this forest. The dreadful fate to which I've been appointed on account of my sins. - [Woman] You're thought to be dead. - (laughs) Oh, do I look alive? - Don't try to spellbind us, druid. - It would not work. You have no imagination, shorty, unlike the lady. Listen to me carefully (laughs). Who cleft the devil's foot? When did the 50 Danaeds come with their saves to Britain? What secret was woven into the Gordian knot (laughs)? Why did Jehovah create the trees and grass before he created the sun, moon, and stars (laughs)? Where shall (mutters) be found? - Cover your ears, Ethne. - You'll have to find another to babble the answers. I'm no longer worthy to furnish the answers. Because of my injustices among men, I was the cause of the slaughter of that battle so infamously borne. Ah, (speaks foreign language). I hear a mighty voice calling, "Midren, Midren! "You alone are guilty for the blood of the 80,000 slain. "You have been condemned to the other world "to dwell among the beasts until the hour of your death!" (orchestral music) I am a stag of seven ruts! I am a flood that crossed the plain. I'm a wind on a deep lake. I'm a tear the sun lets fall. I'm a hawk above the cliff (laughs)! I'm a thorn beneath the nail. I'm a wonder among flowers. I'm a wizard of many powers! - Where's he gone? - Who cares? He's obviously mad. Let's get out of here. (bird chirps) - Is it true that Midren's the last master of the Drake order? - Those days are done. - But who knows the answers to the lost wisdom? - Don't ask me, Ethne. My skills are in the hand, not in my head. (dramatic music) - Go check the ship covers and not let any water. - Go and check it yourself. - So it's a decision by committee, is it? - Aye. (man laughs) - Is that so? - We paid you good money for land. When are we going to get it? - [Man] Right now. (man screams) (weapon slices loudly) Get your ass to the ship now! (men chant) - She's a hag! - Hag in a shawl. - Drunken old hag. (men laugh) - Sounds like, ship. - Sunk ship. - Monk! Monk. (men laugh) - But you're still an old hag. - Ship or I lay a curse on ya. (woman screams) Get off me, you big swine. You need a bath. Get off me. Get off me, get off me! (men laugh) - I'm sodding you, you little pig. - Get off me! - Come on! (men laugh) - Get off me, get off me! (woman screams) You animal! (woman screams) (water splashes) (woman screams) (man laughs) You animal! (men laugh) - Take care, Thorston. I warrant Aretha's had enough of your ways. (men laugh) (knife pounds loudly) You, my merchant friend, will remain there until your bones turn white in sun then I will take your skull and smash it to pieces before grinding it down into powder to chalk my axe end (laughs). (water splashes) - Gallum! Gallumor. It's Defenwol from Roderick's host. - I'm not leaving me with that brute. - Be quiet. He'll not harm you. He's mute. If he tries anything, slip him this. Dewberry poison, slow but deadly. - You're to have this woman cook and clean for you in return for providing for her. She'll do your cooking, clean your hut, and feed your animals. Listen, your Pictish brute. She'll sleep in her own bed. You lay one of your filthy paws and I'll personally come back and lob your head off. Got it? - Ah. (orchestral music) - Why are you going along with Tadwell Cathinson's plans? - I'm just following orders. Listen, one of these days, I'll tell you what I really think of your silly ideas about love. I'll tell Sir Roderick to change his mind. Good luck. We'll be back in a few days to fetch you home again. Use the dagger if he doesn't behave. He's been warned. (drum beats) - What are we waiting on? - Picts. - Do you not know where to find them? - They have found us. They've been watching us for the last hour. - Where? - You'll not see them, but there they are. - Are we not going to meet them? - No, all we have to do is stay on this road. (men chant in foreign language) - How much is it worth, Lewis? - Ooh, that thing gives me the heebie-jeebies. (woman laughs) (all laugh) - She looks familiar. - [Man] Aye, she does. - She's that Fengal's daughter. - No, Beth. Fengal's daughter is a little lassie. - Aye (mutters). Her teeth were all crooked. - Remember, she was a chickadee so-and-so. - Aye (laughs). Remember, she used to dress like a sheep? (all laugh) - That's right. - Shut off, the pair of you. I am Fengal's daughter. Let me free. - Why should we do that, man? - Aye. That Fengal still owes me a new dress. - Fengal's death. - Sir Roderick paid the Angles to kill Fengal. - That's what it looks like to me, Lewis. - How else would they have got away so easily? - With Fengal dead, that Roderick makes himself king and gives his land to any Tut, if, or (mutters). - Even Anglo settlers, man! - Grandfather wouldn't do that! - Ooh, sensative. - Goes with her age, Lewis. It's made of wood. - Is that a man, Beth? - No, she's wearing a dress. - I'm wearing a dress, man. So is Nian. - You're wearing skirts. How can I get a dress like this? - From a monk. - A monk? - You know, a Christian teacher. - Maybe we can help you avenge Fengal if you help us find a monk. - We'll have to work out some tactics before we go chasing Angles. - (speaks foreign language), those Picts are pure (mutters) when it comes to fighting. (speaks foreign language) (all yell in foreign language) (man screams) (man laughs) Go on, Beth. Show them how a Pict does it. (grass rustles) (man screams) - Do it again. I'm too old for this, Lewis. - [Man] No, Beth. We can still do it. (man screams) - We are marked men. Look what he's already done to you. Eric's already taken over your estate and calling it his own. - We won't give him the satisfaction of being challenged. - And how do we do that? - Steal the ship. - Take me with you. (man grunts) - What are you three crows looking at? And you. Get me some food! (dramatic music) (woman screams) (man yells) (water splashes) (men yell) (water splashes) (dramatic music) - They've taken the ship! - [Man] No! (dramatic music) (Axe slices loudly) (man yells) - Cut the anchor! Haul away. (men yell) (man and woman laugh) - Take the helm! (orchestral music) (goat bleats) - Come on. (orchestral music) (axe chops loudly) (orchestral music) Eat up, it's good for you. (man spits loudly) - You never asked for it to be hot. Keep your temper. No one else wants it. (orchestral music) (birds call) - Thorston! We are far from home and we cannot risk a winter in this hostile land. We must find a new ship. Yorick, you will be my second until Thorston regains our favour. Selwin, you will guard the rear. With our numbers, we'll put to fly any 20 who come against us. (men chant in foreign language) (orchestral music) - That was no way to treat a lady. - Said he couldn't bring the ship close to shore. - That's tripe, Orny. You know it. He just couldn't wait to get rid of me. - That's not true, mum. - And he hadn't even the decency to escort me to Roderick's court. - I don't think Roderick has a court in the sense we know, mum. - Oh! Orn. Please stop messing around me like an old woman. Orn! Wait! Go and ask that peasant and ask him the way to Roderick's castle. - Yes, mum, right away. - Oh! Oh, my God. What have I got myself into? (horn music) (man grunts) (orchestral music) (man grunts) (orchestral music) - It's time you learned how to act around a lady. Now dry yourself off and go and cut some wood. We need some kindling for the fire. (orchestral music) - Defenwol, what news? - We found the bride, governor. - Show it in. - She doesn't want to see you. - What? - She expected a maidservant to help present herself. This would be a good time to be mellow and go back to your house. - Where have you lodged her? - In the farm at Talbot. - Where? - Talbot. - You moron, Defenwol. Get a band of men to arms now. - [Man] For what purpose? - Do as your ordered, Defenwol. Eric had instructions for me to put ashore at Talbot and run the farmers off. If he discovers Melengal there, he'll hold her for ransom. - What a mess. You'll have to assemble a band of men and march there at first light. - Keep it down, Roderick. A small force should be adequate. Otherwise, you'll alarm everyone. - I am a (mutters). - I told you to keep it down. Now you leave this to me. Now, do you think you'll manage to woo your wife-to-be while I'm gone? - I will handle Langrith O'Neal. - I must warn you, that monk of hers is a loose arrow. - Take that bloody monk of hers with you. Call it spiritual guidance. The last thing I want is her lecturing me on how to run our affairs. (woman sighs) - Get up. Here. Rub my legs. Don't start any of that mother Jesus stuff. I've never walked so far in my life. This is a hell hole. These Britons or whatever they call themselves are a bunch of ignoramuses. That Roderick must be a right idiot. I mean, any man in his right mind would have come down to take me up by now. Behave yourself! Rub my haunches. They're sore from that stupid donkey. Oh, Orn. As soon as we get the change, we'll go to Rome and tell the pope about this sorry land. Oh! Mm, mm. (loud bellowing) - One-and-a-half fathoms! (loud bellowing) - There must be a way out of this fjord, Wilfred! - It was dark when we sailed up here. - I see rocks! - [Man] Starboard! - It's not rock, it's a monster! (loud bellowing) (loud crash) (dramatic music) - Wilfred! Where's Wilfred? I can't swim! - Well, you better learn quickly before the monster eats you! - You bitch. You're leaving me to die. I mean, I'm originally from Frisia and there we don't treat Christians well at all. We tie them to the stake on the beach and when the tide comes in, they drown. - Shut up! I should have let you drown. - Ah, I get your point. You'll hear no more from me until we reach land. - You've said too much already. - I apologise. I owe you my life. (all laugh) - The Angle ship will take them. They're arks of war. - Oh Beth, I told you not to say anything. There'll be no stopping her now until she finds them. - As long as I get my new dress, Lewis. (orchestral music) - What do you want? (loud slap) (dramatic music) (man grunts) (dramatic music) (woman breathes heavily) (dramatic music) (man laughs) - That's a fine axe, my friend. I'll fight you for it. If you beat me, you can have me sword. (man grunts) Eric Copperson. My fame precedes me. They set out a field, then do it right. If it please me, men, you will leave him and his wife alone in peace. If you lose, I win your farm and she becomes me bond servant. What's fairer than that? (loud spitting) (man grunts) (man laughs) - Go on, Eric. - Go on, Eric. Take it! - Come on, son. - [Man] Make it quick! (men yell) - Lop his head off! (Eric laughs) - Go on, son. - [Man] Lop his head off. (men laugh) - Fight, old man. Fight! (man grunts) Come on! (spear slices) - Ah! (men laugh) (man grunts) - Go on, take him Eric! - Go on, son. (man grunts) (men laugh) (man screams) - Oh! - Go on, son. Take him out! - Come on, Eric. Half him! Slit his throat. Make it quick, for God's sake. - [Man] Make it quick, Eric. Come on! (men yell and laugh) - [Man] Get up, old man. Come on! - Come on! - Come on, Eric! Half him, slit his throat. (men laugh) Finish it. (men yell) (men laugh) - Ooh! (men laugh) (man grunts) - Come on, Eric. This time, quickly Eric. - Come on, come on. - Finish him. (men yell) Take his head. (loud crunching) (men laugh) - Yeah! (men laugh) - You're not English, are you? - My father was a tailor from the Dane land. My mother, a cloth girl from Frisia. - So, you can sew? - Finest sewer this side of the Germanic Sea. Built my merchant business from nothing. - You got rich by sewing? - Flax farming. I own two dozen wetland farms that grow flax for cloth making. I employ 50 weavers in Northumbria and 20 stitchers in Yorick. Do you know anybody looking for work? - Are you for real? - I'm a businessman. Why else would I be in this beautiful land? - To rob it? - Come now, I'm here to invest, not to steal. - Same thing, isn't it? - Hey listen, I like you. How would you like to work for me full time? - I only do short contracts. Why? What have you got in mind? - Find that Eric and help me kill him. - The finding will cost you half that bag of gold. - And the killing? - I'll do that for free. (orchestral music) (men yell) (man grunts) - No matter how hard I hacked, my blade would not bite. Curse him. He blunted it and near smashed my shield. So, I used all my might on that axe hatching off. Bated his breath before breaking that whole cow's back. (men yell) - Braggarts. - Hear that, lads? She thinks I'm a braggart. - [Man] Aye, that you are! (man laughs) - I'm proud of it. (drum beats) Where did you learn English like that, girl? Well lads, these are not the hands of a Pictish farm wife, are they? - You all smell of fish. (men laugh) - We're men of the sea. Salty, but well cured. (men laugh) Now my bonny lass, who are you? - Who do you want me to be? - One little slip and I'll push this right through your skull. - Eric! We've a ship to find. - Pack the valuables and throw that farmer into the ditch. Be two men here and get the rest ready. She must know the way to Roderick's hall. Bring her with you. - What's that? - A map of all the farms sold to me. - I smell treachery here. - Don't be crazy. - You reap what you sew. - Hey, where are you going? I thought we had a bargain. - I'm a good liar. Got me freedom now and I intend to keep it. - Oh, suit yourself. - You still intend to find that Eric? - I think I'll stick to flax farming. (orchestral music) - So let's get down to it. Will you give me an heir? - No, I hate children. I don't want to marry you anymore than you want to marry me, but it is a solution to our problems. You need to legitimise your claim to be king of this godforsaken country and I need to get marriage out of the way before getting on with the rest of my life. - You want a sham of a marriage? - Isn't that what you want? Tadwell told me. I'm happy to go along with it on one condition. - I don't sleep with you? (woman laughs) - That's hardly even imaginable. No. Once we marry, I'm allowed to go on a long pilgrimage through Rome. - To Rome? How long for? - The rest of my life. (man sighs) - How much is that going to cost me? - 500 gold pieces. - What? You're robbing me blind. - Now you get it. Come, Roderick. Kingship comes with a price. You can legitimately steal from your subjects to pay me. I'm going to count to three, then I'm off back to Ulster. One, two. - I'll give you your money. - I'll have Orn draw up a charter. - What? - We'll have it in writing. If you stop the payments, I can get the pope to excommunicate you. Can I have my deposit now, please? - You want a deposit? - Mm-hmm. 100 coin should do for the moment. I'm sure you hide your money somewhere in this cow shed. (orchestral music) - Caethonton! - Well, well. Aldric Aethelson. I thought Eric would have drowned you by now. Eric must be getting soft. - You double-crosser! You never meant to sell me these lands. - Put him with the others! (dramatic music) - [Man] Hey, Angle! (woman gasps) - I'm not an Angle, I'm a druid's daughter. - Druids don't have daughters. They don't have wives. She's a goblin! - My name's Aretha Melgwin. I was captured by the Angles when I was a child. - That's Eric's axe. - You are an Angle! - I'm not an Angle! - If you're a druid's daughter, answer me this riddle. Who cleft the devil's foot? - The prophet Ezekiel. He's Jehovah. Charged archangel Michael to collect Adam's dust and create man. It was a Wednesday, Mercury's day, and he fought the devil, the serpent of the minora in the form of Nabu, the winged god. Hence, the cleft foot. - What secret was woven in the Gordian knot? - That learning, patience, and ingenuity are needed to perform a task decently. When Alexander cut the knot, he set a precedent for placing the sword above religion, justice, and honour. - Why did Jehovah create the grass and the trees before the sun, stars, and moon? - Jehovah's name hides the seven pillars of wisdom, wrapping the five vowels of knowledge. The tree for every letter of the alphabet. And for each pillar a tree makes each of the seven days one of the seven heavenly bodies. - She's not a goblin. She's a druid's witch. Let's burn her! - No! - I'm trying to learn about the tree of knowledge, here. One last question. Where shall the weston be found? - You'll find it in a virgin. - (laughs) A virgin, look here. What do you say to that, Beth? - Well, there's as much chance of finding a virgin around here as there is a monk, Lewis. - Beware the unicorn. If it snuggles you here, you lead it to its hunters! - That's enough of that, sorceress. Gag her! - [Man] Oh, it's not happening, man. - Bud's spoken, Domlin. She's to be spared. - Ah Lewis, that's not fair. I'll have a good burning. - Protect me from these heathens and I'll use my powers to lead you to Eric. - I've got fire! (men laugh) - We've got a job to do. (dramatic music) - Tell me, have you got anymore gold hidden away? - I wouldn't give it to you if I had. - (laughs) Well, that's a pity. It might have saved your life. - You didn't have to do that, Tadwell. - He's an Angle, Defenwol. Isn't that right, love? We all know how much you hate Angles. - I'm not the one who killed them. - I have a good mind to be getting on with this hanging. - So you can keep the gold for yourself? - I'm going to marry Roderick's daughter. - Over my dead body. - Is that so? Well, we've got a spare rope. String this big ape up with the others. - In the name of God, what are you doing? - You really should have a little more faith in my abilities, Defenwol. (dramatic music) Higher. (dramatic music) (axe slices) - Picts! Get after them! (Diffenwol coughs) - Ethne! (Defenwol coughs) (dramatic music) (man grunts) (dramatic music) - Come on then, big man. Let's see what you've got. (dramatic music) - Prepare to meet your maker. (men yell) (swords clang) (dramatic music) (swords clang) (men yell) - What's the matter? Getting tired, love? (dagger slices loudly) - Ow! (dramatic music) (men yell) (man gasps) (dramatic music) - Lay not a finger on me, my son. I'm appointed by God. - Hold yourselves. Make Tadwell a big cross, priest. All warriors deserve a decent burial. (flute music) Our duty is to rescue Melengal from the Angles. - This land is full of heathens! - It just seems that way. - Seems that way? The king's daughter has been kidnapped by Angle warder knights. Her granddaughter is in league with an outlaw and Pictish bandits. And your men, they're useless boys. - They don't have the heart for it, and nor do I, but we'll do our duty. - And I will do mine. In the name of God, I'm taking over this Christian mission. - You're not on a mission. This land's been Christian for 200 years. - I can't see it. God is our commander and I'm His lieutenant. You two, make me a cross. - We all love. - [Warriors] God! - Who do we love? - [Warriors] God! - [Orn] We all love. - [Warriors] God! - Who do we love? - [Warriors] God! - We all love. - [Warriors] God! (loud billowing) - Who do we all love? - [Warriors] God! (loud billowing) - [Orn] We all love. (dramatic music) Who do we love? We all love. We all love, we all love, we all love. (Melengal yells) (man laughs) - Ain't you gonna untie me? - Maybe, if you're nice to me. - I'm being as nice to you as I can given the situation. - I mean really nice to me. - Wouldn't it be better if I lead you to Roderick's hall? (man laughs) - I mean it! (man laughs) (man grunts) - Now we're talking, girl. - Would you kill him for me? - Kill the governor? Of course. But as for a ship I own first. (Melengal laughs) Do you think he'd give you one looking the way you do? - What, the hair? Well, that's just me being one of the boys. At home, I let it grow and everybody says I'm very attractive. - I think they're too frightened to tell you the truth. - You're probably right. They know what I'm capable of. I'm very good with my hands. - I believe you. I bet you've snapped a few necks with those. - I've lost count. - Don't you get tired of killing? - It's a job. Someone's got to do it. (Ethne laughs) - Why don't you settle down, get a wife? Have little Erics? (Eric laughs) My wife's fat and ugly. I was thinking about giving her to Thorston. - She is ugly. (men laugh) - She was my brother's wife until he was murdered by Fengal four Wednesdays ago. - Roderick's champion? - The nobles, they are rotten with jealousy. Fengal boot was betrayed without a single fight. You Celts, you're so single-minded. You're too fair to be a Pict's wife. Everything about you is noble born. The way you walk, hold your head, your manner. Who are you really, girl? - There's nine of them. - Too many for us. We'll pick them off at the High Pass tomorrow. - [Woman] What about Melengal? - She can fend for herself. She's survived up 'til now. (man speaks foreign language) (dramatic music) - You searched everywhere? - What is that thing? - The beastie. It's harmless. Forget the monk. In the morning, we pursue the Angles. Melengal's more important to me than Roderick or Eric the Axe. (fire crackles) (loud knocking) - Get out and shut the door! - Why are there no women in your house? - My wife, Munfield, died giving birth to my last child, Melengal. Morgana was my favourite child. She eloped and ran off with Fengal, who went off to war and left her pregnant. His brother married her and brought up my grandchild, Ethne, as his own. After eight years, Fengal returned with a Roman wife called Lilian. She brought the Yellow Plague with her. Morgana died of it. - Did the children die, too? - No. I love Ethne, but my own child, Melengal, she's a constant disappointment to me. - Well, there must be some good in her. You can't all be heathens. - She's a whining child. Nothing pleases her, nothing! - Well, maybe if you fixed the place up a bit she might like it. Where are they now? - Who knows? Women these days, they just don't want to stay at home. (woman laughs) (flute music) (bird calls) (dramatic music) (dramatic music) (man whines) (men laugh) - Bring him, warden. What's this? - The enemy! (men laugh) - What shall we do with him, Yorick? - [Yorick] Throw him over a cliff, Eric! - No, no, no, no, no. Too quick! Let's have some sport. (man groans) (dramatic music) - What's your name? - A name you dare not speak (laughs). What's your name, darling? - A name they must not hear. - Oh. - Let me spare you this end. It's dewberry poison. - I'd rather have mistletoe juice. - Ah! - You sweet daughter of Alban (laughs). How many, many months be in the year? There are 13, I say. A mid-summer moon is the merriest of all, next to the merry month of May. How many sacred trees be in the wood? There are 13, I say. Oh! One, I say. (men laugh) She's dressed in white, riding on a horse, queen of the merry month of May! How many merry months be in the year? There are 13, I say! The mid-summer moon is the merriest of all, next to the merry month of May. (man screams) (men laugh) (orchestral music) - [Beth] Where are you going? Ah, ah! Lewis! (orchestral music) - You Celts, still sending girls to do men's work? - That's all we think of you. - What do you want? The hostage? - Give yourself up. (Eric laughs) - What, so you can convene an assembly and I can plea for me men's lives before you hang me? I don't think so. Why don't I come over there and break your scrawny little neck? - Why don't you try it? - I'll fight you for that axe, girl. Let's set out in a field and duel. I'll tie one hand behind me back, wear a blindfold, hop on one leg, and I'll still kill you. - It's a Celt you seek. I'm here. (thunder rumbles) - What quarrel do you have with me, lad? - Bad poet that needs his tongue cut out. (Eric laughs) Thorston! This loudmouth says I'm a bad poet. - Aye Eric, that you are, but you're also a bone-crusher and a skull-smasher. - No Thors, you're a liar. I'm a blood-spurter and a throat-slicer. I cleave heads off. - No, this one's mine. I'm going to chop you like a rabbit1 (dramatic music) (men yell) (dramatic music) (men grunt) - [Eric] So then, get up! Kill this kelp! (men grunt) (man laughs) Come on, kill the Pict! (men yell) (man yells) (man grunts) (dramatic music) - Come on, kill him! (men laugh) Come on! (dramatic music) (man grunts) (water splashes) (thunder rumbles) (dramatic music) - Go back, Yorick. Eric's done wrong, Yorick. You're a good man. Quite this country now before Eric ruins you all. - I got Domlin killed. What do you say we finish this in the High Hills? (weapons clank) (orchestral music) - Whoever you are, it's you they want! Yorick, form a file. We're going to march over these hills 'til we come to Roderick's hall. Move out! - Eric's gone berserk, Yorick. - We have to follow orders, Alfred! Quit whinging. Get in line! (dramatic music) - We're being watched, lads. By Picts. - Picts. This madman will lead us to our deaths. - Aye. - Let's take the girl, trade her with the Celts for safe passage. - We could never have it. - Well, let's kill him. (dramatic music) - I want you to scour the pass. - Why me? - [Eric] I trust you not to run away. - This land has bewitched you. (dramatic music) - A band of Celts! - [Eric] How many? - Too many for us! Make her tell us who she is. (loud smack) (man laughs) - Hold your your barbary, you heathens! This is a Christian woman. You will not defile her with your dirty habits. Get on your knees and recant your sins. - You know nothing of our ways, priest. - Where do you come from, Eric? Guided by God and I haven't time to save the chastity of King Roderick's daughter. - This is Roderick's daughter, lads. She is our passage home. (man and woman grunt) (daramatic music) - This way! - Get her! (dramatic music) (Eric yells) (dramatic music) (Orn yells) - Ooh! (dramatic music) - Where are you, cowards? Come out and fight like men. (men yell) - Drop your sword and I'll spare you wounded. - I have the right to die like a warrior. - Let him run the arrow. - On your knees. Yonder, beyond that hill, lies the sanctuary stone where the priest went. If he reaches it before his pursuers catch him, he'll be granted free passage back to Northumbria. - Who are to be my pursuers? (Eric cries out) - Those you hae wronged the most. (Eric laughs) Women? (Eric laughs) - You've mocked us and ridiculed us, you've killed innocents, you have no respect for life, so we have no respect for you. (Eric yells) (dramatic music) - You too, Aretha? - You are destined to rot in the black ground of this mountain. - Fie the arrow short, Celt so I can break their scrawny little necks sooner rather than later (laughs). (dramatic music) (Eric yells) (thunder rumbles) (dramatic music) (Eric gasps) (woman cries out) (dramatic music) - Try not to set the last of the Angles free. - You're all heathens! I'll be back to teach you the ways of God. - Look Lewis, I've got a dress just like the statue. (dramatic music) - Come on, bitch. - Go! - What is it with you women? - Come on. (Eric grunts) - Who are you, girl? - Does it matter who we are? We're women. Our history is never written. - Then write it now! (axe slashes loudly) (dramatic music) - Five years upfront. I should have thought of that earlier. - Are you, Langrith O'Neal, free of all disease? - I should think so. - Are you with any other man's child? - Everyone knows I'm a virgin. (Roderick laughs) (all men laugh) - All right, let's just get a move on and away from these idiots. - Are you, Roderick Coulhen, free of all sickness of the mind? - I am. - Henceforth, Langrith O'Neal, daughter of Havanmile of Ulster, will be known as Queen of Roderick Coulhen, King of Strathglide, Prince of Briton, defender of the wall. In custom, all here assembled are bid to witness this declaration and say aye. - [Men] Aye! - Out of my way, Defenwol. - I'm sworn to save the king, Melengal. - (laughs) If he's a king, then I'm an angel. - You're bold, Melengal, to dare to disrupt my wedding. I could have you hung for this. - Go back to bed and rest your wounds. - You betrayed Fengal! You were the last to know. - The needs of the country came first. - I put a curse on this hall and on your kingship. You can rot in hell. - Melengal! - Your role has come to an end. One of these days, I'm going to tell you what I really think about your silly ideas of duty. - Ethne! (sword clatters to ground) (flute music) - Right, so, we'll be off. - You can't leave me like this! You're my wife. - Oh! We had a bargain and I fulfilled my part of it. It's not my fault if nobody likes you. Looks like you won't be able to afford my annual upkeep. Not to worry. When I see the pope, I'll kiss his ring and he'll send his archbishops, bishops, and monks to collect it for me. Come on, Orn. - You have any more trouble with them heathens, send for me! - [Woman] Come on, Orn! (orchestral music) - Did Lilian make it to Rome? - She could charm her way to China. - What happens now? - I could marry Defenwol, have children, continue the royal line of Connede. - No. - No? Nah. - What about grandfather? - Well, he needs to be retired. Do you remember that Cullde island? - Or the old castle where they walled the nun in? - Or the loch with the beastie. - I think we should send them to live with the Picts. - Oh (laughs)! That's an excellent idea. I can just see it now. (man mumbles) - Roderick, call yourself king (laughs) of Strathglide. (man mumbles) Roderick, Roderick! King of Strathglide, ah! Roderick! - One last thing. The black madonna, who was she? - Well, some people say she was Jesus's woman friend. - You mean Mrs. Jesus? - Yeah. - Really? - Mm-hmm. - [Ethne] Did he love her? - Jesus loves everybody. - Yeah, but did he love her with all his heart? - Yeah. There's no doubt about that. (orchestral music)
