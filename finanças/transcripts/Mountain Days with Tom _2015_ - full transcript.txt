Mr. Tom in the Mountains This way, right? Yes, this way. That's correct. Indeed. The bus just left. Thank you. How can you say just "thank you"? Thank you very much. Thank you very much. No need to thank me. If we walk faster, we'll arrive in an hour. Let's go. Did you achieve it? Which one? Is it not okay? Still not there? Look, it's right there. I'm back. - Welcome home. - I'm back. - i'm back. - welcome back. Come in. Unfortunately, the bus just left. We walked here from the station. Must be exhausted. Akira this is your room. Cabbages didn't grow well either. What's the reason? Cabbage moth, perhaps? The insects weren't completely eliminated. I see. Next, we have to plant eggplants. Yes. We can harvest spinach next month, right? Then it's turnips, pumpkins, and cucumbers. I really want to eat watermelon in the summer. But planting so much at once won't work. Is there any difficulty? There's not much difficulty. It's just that there's too much work to do. Yes. It'll get even busier from now on. But Akira is here too. It's Uncle Gen and Aunt Shiori. Is it alright? It's okay. Sister Hana, you're back! Yes. We brought some vegetables for you. Sorry, thank you. We've always been grateful for your care. We'll leave them on the veranda for you. Okay, thank you. Is this place alright? It's good. Um... Sorry, this is my nephew, Akira. He'll be staying here for a while. Please take care of him. We're always happy to help. This small matter is nothing to worry about. We both enjoy doing it. We harvested a lot of cabbages and wanted you to try some. Cabbages, huh? You brought so many. They look so shiny and delicious. We mostly make cabbage dishes at home. But if we can harvest leafy vegetables throughout the year, we'll end up eating vegetable rice all the time. Shiori taught me some dishes, and they've been very useful. I'm glad to hear that. What grade is Akira in? He graduated from junior high school this year. So, he's spending his spring break here? Yes, that's right. By the way, you have a face like a baseball player. Really? Hey, why do you suddenly mention baseball? You're talking nonsense again. Do you play baseball? I used to play until my second year of junior high. You actually figured that out? I was right, wasn't I? I'm sorry, he also played baseball and wanted to find a fellow player. We should be leaving now. If you need anything, feel free to ask. Don't hesitate. Thank you. Please take these with you. Shiori made some delicious snacks. Take them all. I tried making snacks too, but I could never get them right. Although it's a bit troublesome, if you use the right amount of ingredients, there won't be any problems. If there's anything you don't understand, please let me know anytime. Thank you. Then, we'll be leaving now. Goodbye, Akira. Okay, goodbye. Sorry for the disturbance. Where are the words Sorry to bother you all the time Where should we say this? Thank you. Be careful on the way. Thank you. Goodbye then. Goodbye. Thanks to those two, we can manage our life here. In the beginning, they taught us how to use farming tools. Spread the cabbage leaves. There's so much meat filling. Roll it up. Roll, roll, roll. Press it tightly inside. It's so long. Is this okay? Press it tightly, press it tightly. Let's dig in. It looks delicious. Can we cut it open? Have some lamb and celery. Akira, have some too. It's delicious. Cut it open quickly. Delicious. Is it sliced open? Looks fantastic. How is it? Delicious, this radish is tasty. The radish is delicious indeed. Oh no, is this...? Yes, it's a rat. It's been a while since they've come out. Isn't there an unused shack on the right side of that road? During the last rain, those guys moved into our house, didn't they? They're getting bolder. And it's unsanitary too. Mr. Gen said we can use rat poison. But we have kids at home; we can't do that. Using rat poison isn't an option. But we can't just let them be. Let's have Akira take care of the rats. What do you think? It's a good idea, isn't it? Is there a problem? Rats? mouse? There's a really big one running around. It scared me. Alright, let's eat. I'm starting Pardon the interruption... There are boots and hats in the storage room. And some work gloves. You did so much while I was away. I had to do it. Akira, pass me the support pole. Get rid of the cucumber without a yellow stem. And space them apart a bit more. What color are they? I can't figure it out. Didn't figure it out? You mean the big blue ones with the beak? The area around their eyes is red. is that so? How many are there? Four. Four. Four, here are two more. Yeah. Akira, you shouldn't rely solely on arm strength when hoeing. Hold it like this. Use your waist to apply force. And keep your body's center of gravity agile. If your footing isn't stable, you could get hurt if you lose focus. The beginning is crucial. Even young folks can injure their back if their posture is incorrect. Mom! There's a rat! where? It ran away. run away It appeared again? They've been particularly audacious lately. Every night, they hold sports events on our roof. Wandering around boldly right in front of us. Maybe we should get a cat. A cat is the only option for rat control. But Ah Shi seems to be a bit scared of cats. I just mentioned that if we want to get rid of the rats, we can only have a cat. Do you dislike cats? I don't dislike them, but I'm a bit afraid. Leave it to me. When I lived in Tokyo, outdoor cats often came to our house to play. got used to it. Since Mr. Gen suggested it... However, it's about keeping animals, so we still need to think it over. Here you go. Thank you. - I'm starting." - "I'm starting." Delicious. It's so warm today. Yeah. It feels great. Delicious. Hana, are you alright? Akira, you're still not using the hoe correctly. Use your waist. We've already taught you how to dig the soil. yes. You've worked hard today. You're welcome. How about raising chickens? We can have delicious eggs every day. That's a great idea. Then you can prepare a chicken dish. I'll get ready right away. I'm counting on you. We'll leave now. Be careful on the way. Goodbye. goodbye. Thank you. No problem. Is it delicious? Oh, she's really good at making stews. Do you like it? How is it? Delicious. Is it tasty? Have some cooked vegetables. Give me that plate. Alright. What book was you reading just now? Little home. Little home. Is it good? Have you finished reading it? Yes, finished reading it. You read really fast. Give me the plate. Okay. But recently, I've been working at my desk all the time. It's been a long time since I did physical labor; I'm really tired. Today's work is also quite heavy. Still, I have to work in the fields every day to get used to it. Me too. The mice had a party last night and disturbed my sleep. The mice are getting more and more audacious. I have to check carefully how much damage they caused. How's the watercress vegetable? Is it delicious? Mom, make me another good one. Alright. The losses are much more severe than expected. I can't bear it anymore. Get a cat. Really? Shiori, this is Toki. Please take care of the cat issue. I want a cat that can sweep the mice out of the house. Lately, you've been working hard. Take a good rest today. I'm really sorry. Don't worry; we have Akira here. I'll open the curtain a little. Can you eat now? Thank you. Hello. Welcome. It's born, it's born. Sorry for looking messy. Are you having a cold? A slight fever. Please don't push yourself too hard. You are the backbone of this family, after all. I'm really sorry. Its neck... So adorable. I brought four kittens, and this one is the naughtiest. They say if you want it to catch mice, you shouldn't cuddle it. So cute. Is it a male? Yes, it's a male. After one week, start feeding it supplementary food. So it's still drinking milk now? Hot milk. Cow's milk? Yes, cow's milk is fine. Feed it once every four hours, okay? Don't hold it. So adorable. What's wrong? It's trying to run out. Come in and have a seat. No, I have something to do, so I'll head back now. Oh, I see. Goodbye. Thank you so much. Look, it's full of energy. So cute. This is its tail. So cute. Although it's cute, you have to listen to Aunt Shiori and not hold it. Because this cat's mission is to catch mice. Got it. Boy, you have school tomorrow, right? Get ready, okay? Come on, hurry up. Here, take this. Thank you. I'm so excited. Hana, you said you wanted to raise thirty of them at first. But taking care of ten or thirty doesn't make much of a difference, right? It's different. Thirty are too many. Even ten seem too much for the first time. Is that so? Yes. This way, we'll have not only eggs but also fertilizer. Mr. Gen , goats can also eat weeds. How about raising goats? Is it okay? You're raising both chickens and goats now. Well, if you really want to raise them, I know a place where I can inquire for you. I'm counting on you. If they are female goats, you can make goat cheese with their milk. Hua-jie, I need to go shopping. Can you take care of the cat for me? No problem. The cat is so small; I feel like it might get caught by the mice instead. And we have to make sure it remembers where the litter box is. Remember, although it's cute, don't hold it. Got it. Well then, I'm off. Take care. Though I say that, I really can't resist. So cute. Eat quickly. Did it scare you? Are you full now? Over here, over here... It still doesn't know how to drink from the bowl. What should we do? Seems like it's not drinking. How about letting it drink from the plate instead? Yes, yes, sorry, sorry. This is the toilet, Tom. That's awesome, Tom tom Tom, you'll be called Tom from today. Why does it feel like a name from an English textbook? Why is it called Tom? Isn't it a male? He will become strong and catch lots and lots of mice. Alright, Tom, Tom. Tom, so cute. Hana, let's turn this into Tom's bed. It's so adorable! Tom, look! From today onwards, this will be your bed. It learned the location of the toilet and where to eat all in one day. So clever! With such a smart brain, it'll surely catch many mice. Everyone, keep an eye on it, don't let the mice take it away before it grows up. This one is impressive. - Yeah. - It's so chubby! Each grain is plump. If only it could lay many eggs. I come to collect eggs every morning. Every morning? That's amazing, can you really do it? Yes, I can. Really? Then when it's time to collect eggs, can Mom, Akira, or I help? Sure. What's wrong? It scratched me again. It's still a kid, it can't help it. It will learn not to do certain things as it makes mistakes. Some pain is inevitable. Toshi, want to go shopping together? Sure. Let it in the sheepfold at night. During the day, tie it in a place where it can graze. But remember to change the location often. However, there might be some escape attempts, so be careful. Alright. From the chicken coop to the sheepfold, you've done so much. It's no problem at all. There was nothing here for a long time. I'm happy to see you making it look nice. Alright, we'll be going now. No need to see us off. Sorry, really thank you. Take care on the way. Goodbye. We have more things to do now. But there are also more joyful things. See them off, they are leaving far away. Akira, let's give names to the goats. "Mie " and "Shiro." Which one is "Mie"? The mother is "Mie ," and the child is "Shiro." Why? Because the kid has a white face, although it's a small part. The mother is "Mie," and the child is "Shiro." Then please take care of them. Oh, Tom, What are you doing? A frog. Tom seems to have caught a frog. Tom, Tom well done! look here it's amazing! tom tom you're awesome! Tom you are awesome. live things can be caught If you keep up this momentum, you'll get rid of all the mice Eat quickly, Tom. Tom, Tom, good boy! Good morning. Good boy, good boy. Good morning. Good morning. Toshi gets up so early. Because I'm going to collect eggs now. Right, it's your job. Today, I'll help you. Okay. Let's go. We're taking them. Good morning. We'll take the eggs. Thank you. How are the goats doing? A bit difficult. I don't know why they are always so lively. Being lively is a good thing, right? They are a bit too lively. Maybe it's because of Xiao Bai. Mie might be a bit neurotic. After a while, it will understand your mood. Give me one. Alright. Mie. your belly seems to have gotten bigger. Maybe the greens have grown a bit. Tom, frog! Tom, here! There's a frog! Tom, there's a frog here! Hana, Tom has caught many frogs. That's true. Mmm delicious. What are you doing? You can't do that. If you spoil it, it won't catch mice. I'm sorry. Do you understand? Yes, I understand. Go ahead and eat. Its face seems smaller. You're right. A mouse? Thought they disappeared. Because Tom didn't react to the mice, they started causing trouble again. That's strange. No one has ever held it. Could it be because we fed it beef hot pot? Hurry up, Tom, there's a mouse! please Tom, do your best! Tom! Tom, Tom, there's a mouse! Tom is still asleep. You're quite laid-back. Then you should relax and take it easy. Alright, I'll take your kind words. It would be great if Shiori could come with us. It's okay, her cold never picks the right timing. At times like this, I still have to rely on you for our home affairs... It's alright, she's not seriously ill. It wouldn't be good if she spread it to everyone. Originally, the three of us decided to stay at home. I also want to go. It might be too early for you to join the ladies' meeting. (Women's Association, a social group organized by adult women in Japan for self-improvement, hobbies, etc.) Quick, say goodbye. Safe travels. We're leaving. Safe travels. Safe travels. We're leaving. Akira we'll count on you too. Goodbye. Safe travels. We're leaving. Quick, say "safe travels." - Safe travels. - We're leaving. Wait a moment. Want some color? Want some color? Place the colorful ones in the center. Impressive! Watch out, it's about to fall. Is it ready? Just wait a moment, it'll be ready soon. Great! Not bad, right? Look. Well done. Look! Amazing! Add some tomato sauce. Let's dig in! Looks delicious! Let's try it. How is it? It's delicious. Is it good? Yes, it's really tasty. Is it delicious? Is it tasty? We can already see the other side. really? Are you looking? I'm looking, I'm looking. We're back. Welcome home. Did you take good care of the house? Yes. Is Tom being good? this is a gift. Bean Bun! Bean Bun, oh! It's so delicious! Oh, Tom! Go away, Tom! Tom! It became rude while we were away. Because there are fish treats inside. Tom, Tom! tom Welcome Home! Thank you. You've really been helpful. I'm going to feed the chickens, didn't notice you've arrived. - Welcome back. - Thank you for everything Thank you very much. It's nothing. I've made some tea for you, please have some. - Please sit down and rest. - Okay, thank you. good Have some warm Bean Buns. They look delicious. I'll help myself. Here you go. This one is for you. I'm going to start eating. After Shiro arrived, we saved a lot of time on weeding. It's much easier now. Akira still can't deal with it. He'll get used to it slowly. What's wrong? It's Tom. Because Tom destroyed the fish treats we brought back. Toshi put it in the cabinet as a punishment. I see. But it's quite noisy. Let's go and check it out. Please eat, don't be shy. Okay, thank you, I'll dig in. Delicious! A mouse! Indeed, if a cat doesn't carry it, it will catch mice. But we don't have to kill the mouse, right? We got Tom precisely to deal with mice. Tom, you're amazing! The poor mouse. Let's make a grave for it. It's already dead. Yes. Akira you and Toshi can make the grave together. It's me again. Stop complaining. Just do it. Mom give me a small board good alright Hello, Teacher. Aren't you coming tomorrow? I finished work early, so I came here. This is Miss. Iguchi. She said he's very interested in our way of life. This is Toki. Nice to meet you. I'm Iguchi, Nice to meet you. If you had changed your schedule, you should have told me in advance. We just returned from a trip yesterday. Then I'm really lucky. Do you want to stay at our house? I checked at a nearby resort hotel before coming here. I didn't want to bother you. The air is so nice here. It's so beautiful, all green. It's great. The wooden structured house is fantastic, It gives you a sense of security, like having a grandmother by your side. This kind of place, I've always yearned for this kind of life. Having a villa in the countryside is great, Not a mansion, mind you, But it feels like home. Is that so? You must have been waiting for a while. - Thank you. - Please try it. - It looks delicious. - It's amazing. Hey, Kitty, come here! Don't come here, It looks so delicious. Give that big piece to Jingkou. Which one? This one? the biggest piece. The ingredients are so rich. - Enjoy your meal. - Enjoy your meal. Let's dig in. - Here you go. - Thanks. It looks really tasty. I'm starting now. It's delicious. I wish I could cook like this. My baby at home would love it the most. do you have kids? Yes, a four-year-old. He goes to kindergarten. It's delicious. Are you interested in farming? Growing vegetables on your own is so great. Being self-sufficient would be amazing. I also want to feed my children with such food. Exactly. Exactly. - Go clean the goat pen. - Okay. Goats... Are they chickens? Yes, they are chickens. They lay a lot of eggs. Chickens, huh? Do you still have to do this kind of work? yes. It's really hard work. - Can you handle it? - Yeah. Alright. Good. Welcome back. Welcome back. This is my nephew, Akira. This is Mimi, and the little one is Shiro. Aunty uses Mimi's milk to make cheese. Do you make it yourself? Yes. please let me help. Then... Could you help with washing the rice? Sure. - Please use this. - Thank you. please use this Thanks. Use this one. Alright. Where's the rice cooker? We don't have an electric rice cooker. We cook rice in a wood stove. A wood stove? This one. Want to give it a try? I can't let everyone go without a meal. I'll pass. then give it to me. - Here you go. - Okay. If it's cutting vegetables, no problem. I'll leave the cucumbers and tomatoes to you. Sure. I'll start eating. It's so tender. Very soft. It's delicious. The cat is here. Let it try some sweet potatoes too. What was that sound just now? A mouse. A mouse? Are there mice here? Of course, that's why we have the cat. need to make a call. I left my contact information at the hotel. I'll leave now. Something urgent came up, sorry. Thanks for the hospitality. Um... You seem to be in a hurry. Excuse me. i have to hurry up. Do you want to take some miso with you? Sure, I'll pack it right away. I'm sorry. Thank you. Call a taxi for you? Yeah, I can't use it. Right. Is this enough? That's a lot, thank you. The miso broth is really delicious. Please send a car over. okay. I'm going back now. Please, take care. It was really delicious. I'm heading back now. It will take about ten minutes. Ten minutes, thank you. Are you sure it's no trouble? Yeah, it's fine. It was really delicious. Here you go. Thank you. where can i buy this. We make it ourselves at home. We make it with harvested soybeans. Can miso be made at home? Do you know the phrase "Tenzen Miso"? (meaning homemade miso) "Tezen miso"? First time hearing about it. Butterfly. Here, it's for everyone. What's wrong? Tom just defecated anywhere. Seems like he has an upset stomach. After growing up, I've always been going to the toilet outside. I have a splitting headache. I have to go back to Tokyo tomorrow. Did I eat something strange? Tom on my shirt.. I'll buy you a new ones in Tokyo. Are you okay? Here. Thanks. Tom is here to take his medicine. Tom! It's alright, come. Take your medicine quickly. Take your medicine. Tom! Hana, here. Thanks. Take care of Tom for me. Sure. If you need anything, give me a call. Okay. Tom... Don't die, okay? I'm leaving. Be careful on the way. Hello, everyone. Hello. I tried making the dessert you taught me. I hope I did it right. Thank you. Is Hana out? She's got work in Tokyo. She's been away since yesterday. And she's been worried about Tom not feeling well. His stomach's upset. Really? I'm so worried. You better get better before Hana comes back. Can I open it? Sure, open it and take a look. I think the shape turned out pretty good at least. just don't know how it tastes. Looks beautiful. Right? It's really well-made. Isn't it? Hello. Hello. The weather's lovely today, isn't it? Yes. Let me take a seat for a moment. I've heard of women single-handedly farming, but you've done an impressive job with such a large piece of land. It's been a gradual process. Amazing, truly amazing. You even raise chickens and goats. Impressive, isn't it? Are you looking after the goats? While goats are adorable, they must be quite a hassle. What about a creature like a goat? well, their personalities are probably somewhere between dogs and cats. That's just my personal opinion. Um, let me pour you some tea. No need for the trouble. Um... that... Do you know Shiori? What is it? Yes, the lovely lady. i heard from her that her cat isn't doing well. Oh, not long ago, it seems the cat had stomach issues. Can I take a look? Are you a veterinarian? Yes, in simple terms, that's right. I see. What's the cat's name? Tom. A male, huh? Yes. Tom's bed is really beautiful. Let me do a quick examination of its body. Please. Good boy, good boy. Here, how does this feel? Let's take its temperature. Gently insert the thermometer. Gently remove it now. It seems reluctant to take the medicine from home. After all, it's meant for humans. Perhaps it's thinking, "This isn't the medicine I'm supposed to take." It's colitis. It's quite severe. The medicine is only for today. For the medicine after tomorrow... let's do this. I heard from Shiori that you have a child, right? Yes, she's in elementary school. Then, let my sixth-grade grandson give this to her. What's her name? Toshi. Toshi, right? Then leave it to Toshi. Okay, thank you. No need to thank me. It's my job. Excuse me. Next, I need to assist with a cow giving birth. Physician treatment fee... Include it with tomorrow's medicine. No, no. Anytime is fine. If there's any issue, I'll come over. Thank you. No need to thank me. Great news! Great news! I'm back! You're back! I brought the medicine. Thanks Tom, I'm back! They said there's a letter inside. Okay, thank you. So many! Give this medicine to Tom, and his stomach should get better. If it's not improved yet, mix some wood charcoal powder into Tom's food. I'm back! Welcome back. You've had a tough time. I can't stand the crowded tram. Did you walk back from the station? Yes. You're quite stubborn. I just wanted to get home quickly. That's right. Let me pour you some water. Don't kill Tom! He was already healed before you started farming. Just make a phone call if you need something. I want to convey my feelings through writing. Tom. His complexion has improved a lot. Let me take a look. So adorable. Akira, I bought a shirt for you. Here. Thank you. This one is for Toki. Thanks. heavy thinking for everyone I just tried my best This is for Toshi Thank you. You've been doing a lot of work in the field. Taking care of Tom must be tough for you. Tom. Here's a gift for Tom too. Come here, Tom. Look, Tom. Tom, over here, over here. Come on, Tom. Looks more energetic now. He's looking more energetic. Tom, Tom! Tom! How's that? Do you like it? it likes it. That's great. Tom. How's it going? Do you like it? It likes it. Great! Great! Come on, today you should sleep with the kitty. Here, sleep here. Mwah, hold tight. Tom suffered a lot. Doesn't your stomach hurt anymore? Incredible, incredible. How's Tokyo? Crowded with people and traffic, right? Not easy, huh? My stomach was a bit upset some time ago. But now it's completely fine. The weather here has been consistently good, feeling great. Please take good rest. There's a cat. The first time seeing one. It went into the room. Tom didn't get angry. They're having a friendly meal together. Is it Tom's friend? Then let's call it Chibi. Chibi. Such a big little one. Tom has made a friend, that's great. Sometimes, Tom wants to chat with his cat friends. In cat language, huh? Living on this land. Recently, I increasingly feel that the land is truly remarkable. When you sow a seed, it gives birth to new life, doesn't it? Surrounded by the concrete jungle all day long. Living there, we naturally think we'll stay there until the end of our lives. Dealing with the land is not an easy task either. I used to think that avoiding hard and troublesome things would make me feel better. Honestly, that probably made me more miserable instead. Regardless, life itself is both interesting and challenging, right? Yeah. The child is also living a difficult life. Tom is such a good boy. He's a good boy, indeed. Does it want to try it? Yes. Then you try this. This one is mixed up. Which one does it like? You're asking it which one it likes? It looks like it likes the mouse. Will it catch it? Seems like it wants to burrow under the blanket. Come back here. It's like it deliberately wants to get close. Tom is so adorable. Such a good boy, such a good boy. I'm going to spoil him. It's about time to sleep, right? It's about time to go to bed. Time to sleep. - Tom should go to sleep too. - Go on. Tom is going to sleep. Play a little longer. Go to sleep now. I'll leave it to you. Good night. What am I saying? I only eat this. What's this? That's right, Shiori, thank you so much for finding a veterinarian for us. You're welcome. I heard that Tom got sick that day, and there happened to be a child who was sick near the animal hospital. Don't be fooled by the vet's appearance; he's a top-notch doctor. He's Tom's savior. Can you help me taste it? Didn't you teach me before? Please, go ahead. you're welcome Then, I'll try it. Delicious. - Really? - Very tasty. That's great. It's really good, and his health has fully recovered. Okay, it's right over there. Alright, I'm going to open it. Here, taste this. - I want this one. - Okay. Do you want this one? It's 50 yen, here's your change. Thank you for visiting. Thanks. Um, that big kid... Help the kid get the one on the shelf; he said he wants that one. Sure. Yeah, let's all play together. I want this one. I heard you got 15 points on your math test last time. How did you know? I heard it from your mom. You should aim for 50 points next time Is this what you want? Here's your change. So, how much should I give you? Here you go. Thank you. how much is it It's 90 yen. That's right. Please give me this big one. Sure. Here you go. Thank you for visiting. Here you go. Thank you for visiting 80 yen, please. Okay. So much? Sorry. Here's 1000 yen. Alright. Thank you. is this your son? No, he's my nephew. I see, your nephew. Put those over there in the bag. do you have a bag? Yes, here. Thank you for shopping. Thank you. Auntie, where are you from? We came from a distant place. It takes about an hour on foot. Do you know Toshi? Toshi. We're staying at her place. Toshi runs very fast, you know. We're leaving. Goodbye. Goodbye. Auntie, are you leaving? Yes, I am. Goodbye. - Goodbye Can I come to your house to play next time? Sure, we'll be waiting for you. - Here you go. - Thank you. Toshi is quite a little celebrity. Speaking of which, you've been running fast since elementary school. That's why you became a substitute base runner. Being a substitute isn't bad. There's a chance to get on the field. But I didn't seize that opportunity. My life is over. Your life is still long ahead of you. It's so frustrating. What's so frustrating? Don't talk like a grown-up. Mie and Shiro listen to you more than before, don't they? Isn't that proof that you're gaining their trust? Is it? Hard to say. Though it's been slow, isn't it getting better? Not everything can go smoothly all at once. Even farming has many failures. not everything goes smoothly. But that's what makes it interesting, isn't it? Interesting? Yes. If you only focus on the present, you won't see anything. But by looking ahead, you sometimes see what's in front of you. Daydreaming is also allowed. We're back. Welcome back. Toshi, we met your friend at the grocery store. who is it? We didn't ask for a name, but everyone knows you. They said you run really fast. Tom. Tom, come here, Tom. Ever since Chibi came, we rarely see mice. One is definitely different from two. Tom made friends. Although he goes out more often now, he's still doing his job diligently. His voice is so pleasant. Yes, it's crisp. Here you go. It's delicious, crispy. Hana, you've worked hard. It's been quite challenging. Indeed, don't push yourself too hard. You need to put in more effort this time. Go for it! Thank you. This cheese is delicious. I feel energized again. It's made with Mie's milk. Do you want to try it? Akira is working hard too. It's really tasty, this cheese. Here you go. Spread it on the ham. put a slice of ham on it Akira have some too. Want some ham? Here you go. Is it delicious? We'll take these. Alright, thanks for shopping with us. Nephew, which school are you attending? Seems like you have a secret, huh? In total, it's this much. Here you go, take it. Thank you. Here, take this. Thank you. Thank you. You're welcome. Come again. What did you buy? Yeah, what did you buy? Lightbulbs and such. Your mom will be happy to see you wearing those glasses. Why? They suit you well. Not really. They look good on you. then you wear it No, thanks. Auntie, Auntie! What's wrong? Mie and Shiro are missing. Aren't they hiding nearby? Akira, take a look above. Ah-Shi, contact Uncle Gen. OK. I heard your goat is missing. Yes, they are. I didn't see them on my way here. f they go too far, it'll be troublesome. Let's take Akira with us and go find them by car. Thank you, I appreciate it. Akira, come with me. Where did they run off to? Thank you. I found them in the fields over there. There are many elderly people there, right? yes, they were caught eating vegetable seedlings and leaves. What's wrong with Akira. The elderly man and woman there scolded him severely. Although we brought the goats back, it's a matter of livelihood for those elderly folks. You're right, we should go and apologize to them immediately. Can you take me to their place? Sure. Toki, prepare a gift for the apology. Okay. Is everything alright? Everything's fine, don't worry. Please, it's my fault. Let's go. We're back. Welcome back. What happened? The new seedlings were all eaten by the goats. I'm getting old, but I still have to work hard with aching back. They must be upset that the seedlings were eaten. What about Akira? He hasn't come out of his room since we returned. Starting from today, we'll go there every day and help replant the fields. Then, I should also go back. - Thank you so much for your help. - It's nothing Goodbye. Okay, thank you. Akira how long do you plan to stay cooped up in there? It must be tough. The elderly man and woman were probably frightened, which is why they scolded you so loudly. Even so, there's no need to be so angry. The goats eating the vegetables had nothing to do with me. I was just looking for the goats. I don't want to take care of goats ever again. Mie and Shiro have also become familiar with you. You've received something in return for taking care of them, right? But... Yet, this is the result I got. Akira you know, even if your academic performance isn't good even if you lose a job early, but... when it comes to something you really want to do, you must see it through to the end. Won't you feel bored if you give up halfway? Akira didn't come. Yeah. Oh it's you. Where are you heading? Just wandering around. Are you interested in fishing with me? fishing? Let's go. Alright. I have tea. Take it. Oh, rice balls. They look delicious. Would you like one? Here, take one. I'm sorry It's delicious. This rice ball is really tasty. Is it? I feel great. Feeling? I'm talking about the feeling the person who made the rice ball gives. Feeling? Have you had enough of living in the countryside? Not yet. You're young; it's only natural to want to explore different places. That's for sure. Grandma, have you always lived here? No, actually, I've been to many places and met many people. I only came to live here when I was in my 60s. Fishing became an interest of mine when I was in my 60s too. Try this. Sure. An egg roll. Your life has just begun. The journey of life is still long. You'll encounter all kinds of things. Looking forward to it, aren't you? Hello. Here. Hello. Thank you for yesterday Please come in. Hana. How are the farmlands over there? I followed your advice and replanted the seedlings. During this period, we have to let the farmlands rest. There's no other way. Sorry, I couldn't help you. There's no need to apologize. It's our own responsibility. Let me pour you a cup of tea. I'll go to the farmlands over there. After taking care of the goats in the morning, I'll come to help you. Please pass on my words to Grandpa. Sure. I'm sorry. It's alright. Here's a lunchbox. Take it. Take care. Take care. Today, I need to go to the post office to mail the draft.

On sunny days, doing farm work makes me feel at ease. I'm going out. Tom. What's wrong? What are you doing here? You've never been here before, right? Wait... Hurry home. Tom.

"The Willow by the River" Chapter One The Riverside The mole was busy cleaning its small house the entire morning. First, it swept with a broom, then used a duster to remove the dust. After that, it climbed ladders, chairs, and steps, holding a brush and a bucket of plaster to paint the walls. It worked until the dust choked its throat and clouded its eyes. Its black fur was splattered with plaster Its waist was sore, and its arms were aching. The breath of spring blew over its head in the sky. swimming in the dirt beneath his feet The spirit of longing for spring even penetrated its small and gloomy house. No wonder it suddenly threw the brush to the ground and shouted, "So annoying! What is this spring cleaning nonsense? To hell with it!" While yelling, it rushed out of the house without even putting on its coat. It was as if some voice from above was commanding it, "Come out, come out quickly!" The mole suddenly ran towards a narrow tunnel. This tunnel belonged to the residence of animals who liked the wind and sun. It led directly to the gravel road on the ground. In the tunnel, the mole's two little paws worked tirelessly. It dug, scratched, climbed, and squeezed. In the midst of all this, it muttered to itself, "Go to the sky, go to the sky." Finally, with a "pop," its nose came out of the ground, extending into the sunlight. Then, its body rolled on a large patch of warm grass. It exclaimed, "This is so much better than painting walls! It's so enjoyable!" The warm sun shone on its fur, and a gentle breeze caressed its heated forehead. "Not bad. Nice shot Really? "Can't compliment you." "Okay, watch the ball." "Why do I look so bad?" "Okay, serve." "You're so serious." "Is Akira feeling troubled?" "I think with Uncle Yuan by Akira's side, he'll be encouraged." "I hope so, just as you said." "Serve." sorry sorry. "Okay, you be the pitcher." "Okay, you be the pitcher." "Alright, one more. Serve a good ball." "Hana." "Plum wine." "Thank you." "The stars are increasing." "Yeah." I remember a sentence I read in a book when I was young 'Having freedom, books, flowers, and the moon, is anyone who would not feel happy with these things?'" Also, optimists see the sweet donut itself, while pessimists see the hole in the sweet donut. I'll count on you tomorrow as well. Same here.
