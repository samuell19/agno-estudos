Merry Christmas. Rose? Debbie Carmichael? Rose Harrison? Oh my gosh. I have-- I haven't seen you since-- High school, I'm sure. Oh. Mm. How are you? Well, you know I married Bobby Gadecki. No. Oh my. Four amazing kids. Can you believe it? But enough about me. What about you? Tell me everything. I'm married. Hal, he's a lawyer down on Wall Street, two girls-- twins. Aw. Yeah. Brittany and Ashley. And, uh, in less than, oh my gosh, seven hours I've got to have Christmas Eve dinner for 35 friends and family. So I gotta go. Ugh, 35? Oh! Yeah. Yeah. Well, it was nice to see you. We should get together. Absolutely. We're listed. We're the only Gadecki in Hartford. I bet. Oh, incredible to see you. Oh yeah, incredible. All right. Well, gotta go. Would you like to share a cab? No, no, no, no. I'm just going down here. Well, merry Christmas. Same to you. Unbelievable. Hi, I was just wondering what time your party started. I beg your pardon. You know, your Christmas party. What time does that start? This is an emergency room, not Radio City Music Hall. But you usually have a Christmas party, don't you? Usually. Patients only though. You planning on being a patient? You never know. You look beautiful. You really do. Good morning. How you doing? Guess what I brought you. All your favorites-- smoked salmon with capers, and arugula salad, and, ah, mousse cake for dessert. Huh? And what's the occasion? You might ask yourself. Well, I'll tell you. Tomorrow's Christmas. And that means that we get to spend the whole day together, just the two of us. How about that? Huh, Mom? Hm? And you'll never guess who I ran into. Debbie Carmichael. Yeah-- oh, Debbie Gadecki now. She married Bobby, surprise surprise. They have four kids, a house in Connecticut just filled with oodles of joy and happiness. I could have smacked her. Here, let's try some salmon. Hm? You love salmon, remember? You know, you gotta keep you strength up, Mom. That means eating. You haven't eaten anything since yesterday. Let's give a little salmon and little bitty try. Come on. You don't get any dessert if you don't try your salmon. Come on. OK. All right, all right, all right. Well, you know what? We'll try again later, OK? Look at this. Look what I found. An angel, for your wreath. How beautiful, huh? Yep. Oh. Hello. Oh, hi. I didn't realize anybody else was here. Just me. I'm sorry. I just thought maybe I'd cheer things up a little bit. You know, I felt bad because he never gets any visitors. Yeah. It seems so sad. Except you, of course. But I've never seen you before. Not that you've never been here before. I'm sure you have. It's just that I've never seen you before. It's an angel. It's a very beautiful one-- Renaissance angel. Thank you. That's very kind. Oh, it's Christmas. You know? Merry Christmas. Op, gotta get going. Excuse me. Good morning, Rose. Ope, Dr. Baron. Good to see you. You too. Have you been in to see your mother? Oh, yes. We had a nice, long visit. And you? I was just on my way in. Feeling OK this morning, I hope. Oh, sure. I mean, I know it looks bad-- single woman over 40 at Christmastime. But I'll be fine. Just keep me away from the kitchen knives and open windows for the next few days. You meant my mother, didn't you? Yes. Oops. OK. Bye. Hey. Hey, listen. Hey, what do you say I give you a ride? Come on, I'm a cop. You can trust me. This is where I'm having lunch. Well, then let me take your around the block. I'll bring you right back here where I found you. I promise. Oh, I've been around the block. And nothing I haven't seen before. Well, then marry me. I'll take you anywhere you want to go. Don't tell me a man like you isn't already married. I've been holding out. Oh, yeah? For what? For you. Oh. OK. But let's make it fast. I get bored easily. And I only have an hour for lunch. Do you know how much I love you, Miss Nina Vasquez, about to be Mrs. Riley? Nope. How much? More than you'll ever know. Enough to learn how to dance with me? Not right now. Please? Not right now. Please? You're going to have to dance with me at the wedding. Morning. Morning. Or should I say, afternoon? Did you type up the silly Seth revisions? Yes. I put them on your desk. Great. And merry Christmas. Oh. If you hate it, you can return it. I'm sure I'll love it. I'm sure you'll return it. Your sister called. And she can't spend Christmas Eve with you after all. Ah. Seems it's too painful since your father died. Mhm. So she's spending the next week meditating with Buddhist monks in the Catskills. Good for her. Also, her ex-husband called. Wanted to know if you would like to spend tonight with him, and his beautiful wife, and their two perfect kids in Connecticut. And, oh, finally, your shrink called. She's got to cancel your session today because her husband surprised her with a fabulous trip to Paris for Christmas. That's all. It rang a couple more times. But I was scared for you. So I stopped answering it. What's so funny? Oh, I-- just struck me as being funny that a-- you know, a woman who's never had a child is editing a children's book, when maybe it would be more appropriate for me to work on "Cooking for One," or you know, "How to Survive the Holidays Alone." Don't look at me that way. I'm fine. Do you want my advice? No. You've been looking after your mother for nearly 10 years now, right? Yeah. And before that, you were looking after your father, and also your husband, who walked out on you the day your mother came to live with you. And let's not forget the home-- What is the point? It's time that you stop taking care of everybody else, and start thinking about yourself. As my nana used to say, what you need is-- I know, I know-- someone to take care of me for a change. Wrong. What need is sex-- good sex. Your nana said that. Yes, she did. And by the way, Marco has been looking for you again. Hm? He is so tenacious. Oh, that guy is sexy. He's too young for me. Every woman in the building wants him. Not me. I just want some coffee. Coffee it is. Please, Rose. Sleep with him for me. No. You can tell me all the details. I'll love it. No! Coffee-- just get me coffee. -Ugh. -Jeez. OK. OK. Nina, no. No, I gotta go. I can't be late. No, listen. Dennis is waiting for me, all right? I gotta go. I can't be late. I was beginning to worry. Absent from work yesterday, and apparent no-show today? I thought maybe you had run off to Tahiti and gotten married on me. Now, I'd never do a thing like that without checking with you first. Of Course. So when are we going to dinner? Don't you have deadlines or something? Hey, I got to eat. OK. When? Um, well-- Tonight? Tonight? It's Christmas Eve. So I figure you must have, uh-- No. No. No. No, nothing. OK. Let's do it. OK. Tonight? Yeah. After work. Yeah. It's a date. OK Ho, ho ho. Merry Christmas. Those earrings new? Yeah. Cute, huh? They were a gift. From who? Mr. Brenner. Mr. Brenner? Is that normal, lawyers giving gifts to paralegals? Uh-huh. Mhm? Don't start, Mike. What? What? Come on. Hey, you know, some women would be flattered. What? that the man they were about to marry was a jealous psycho? Yeah. See you at home tonight, OK? OK. Hey, I love you. Excuse me. Could I ask your for a Coke? -Sure thing. Great. So anyway. So my plan is to spend Christmas in the hospital. I know that sounds kind of strange, huh? I mean, the hospital's probably the last place anybody would want to be, especially this time year. Thanks. But see, the thing is, see, out of all the Christmases I've ever had, the only one that was halfway decent was the Christmas where I was 14. I busted my nose open in this sledding accident. They made me spend the whole day at the hospital. That's a shame. No, but it wasn't, see? That's what I'm trying to tell you. Because they threw this killer Christmas party, where the nurses were dressed as elves, and they were singing songs. And they were handing out eggnog with a little bit of booze in it. And they even made little presents, which was really cool. That was awesome. That was the best time I ever had. -I know. -What? I-- -I know. I'm sorry. You know what cup of coffee this is? Number four. Where the hell you been? Wedding plans. You know. Just one cup, I promise, and we're out of here. What can I get you? Uh, just coffee. Oh, hi. Hi. Yeah. Just coffee. And we're in a bit of a hurry. OK. What was that all about? I don't know. It beats me. Do you know the guy? No, I never laid eyes on him before. You sure? Yeah, I'm sure. Because he's looking at you with that-- you know, like-- it's, like, weird. You know what I'm saying. No. What are you saying? -OK. Here you go. Here's your coffee. I had a feeling you'd want it black. Right, black. And I got you almond butter cookies. Almond butter cookies? Those are my favorite. I know. Ah, he's got a thing for you. Come on, cut it out. Come on, his eyes are all over you. And that silly smile-- I know that smile. I've used it. -Nah, you're crazy. He's just-- he's just one of those really nice guys, you know? He's, like, Greek or something. Yeah. They're always hugging and kissing. Or maybe he's-- you know, it seemed like he's kind of slow. No, no. He's not slow, Mikey. I think the guy's just got a thing for two guys in uniform, you know what I'm saying? Two guys? Nah, he's looking at me, not you. No, he was looking at me too. Nah. He wasn't looking anywhere near you. What are you saying, Mikey? That guys don't notice me? Is that what you're saying? That-- that-- that I don't walk down the street and guys don't turn their head to take a look at me? No, I'm not saying that at all. I jus-- I just think the guy's interested in me and not you. Oh. What am I saying here? Just forget about it, all right? Fine. He's all yours. Come on, stop it. You two gonna go furniture shopping together? I said forget about it. You know, I'mma straighten this out right now. All right, Mikey. All right. All right. Calm down now. Come on. Come on. Now, you're a cop, for Christ sake. Cut it out. Easy with that famous temper. Come on, now. You're a cop. OK? Your turkey club's up, Artie. You got my money? Not yet. Oh, come on. Jules, look, if you wan to meet Arizona, I have to get paid first. Look, you know I'm good for it, right? I just gotta go do this one thing. So why don't you tell me where to meet you, and I'll bring you the money. All right, look. Meet me at the old theater on Avenue Way at about 10 o'clock, all right? And-- but don't go in without me. You wait for me. Why? Oh, you don't want to surprise a guy like Arizona, that's why. All right. Well, Glenn, you know I really appreciate this, right? It's Christmastime, man. Can we meet later? What? I get off at 9. Can we get together? I mean, it's been so long. So long since what? Since you and I-- -What? -Since you-- Now wait a minute. I don't know you. All right? Now, you better cut this out. -Mikey. Mikey. Mikey. Mikey, wait outside. Well, you better straighten this out. All right. All right. I'll handle it. We don't have time, OK? Hey, don't-- Hey, buddy. You want to get locked up? No. So stop hassling my friend. Will you, please? You don't understand. It's been such a long time. Hey, hey, hey. Enough, OK? You got the wrong guy. Stop it. OK? He never has any visitors, not even family. I mean-- well, except for this one guy that was there this morning. But I've never seen him before. And I just-- I don't-- I wish that there was something I could do, you know? To be sick and alone, and during the holidays-- it's awful. You know, that's what I like about you, Rose. What? That you care about other people. You know, I have to say that I-- I'm-- well, I just don't feel like I'm really your type. I think you should let me decide that. I'm a little uncomfortable with you, Marco, sometimes. Then let's just relax and have fun, Rose. OK. Good. Because that all I really want to do, is just have some fun. Hey, me too. Didn't I tell you? Best pizza in the city. Mm. Mm. It's very good. -Yeah. Well, this play has been here forever. On the weekends, there's a line around the block. Why don't you have a girlfriend? Or do you have a girlfriend? Well, I did. But, uh, we broke up a few months ago. Oh, I'm sorry to here that. No, dumpee. It was good that it happened. Why was it good that it happened? -Oh, hold it. -What? Wha-- What? -Cheese. Cheese? Yeah, on the side of your mouth. Oh, God. No, let me do it. So now that I've saved you from Tony's pizza, what shall we do now? Um, you want to see a movie? Well, not really. Want to, uh, walk some more ? Yeah, but it's getting cold. Don't you live around here? Yes. Well, we could go back to your place, maybe have a night cap Um, Marco, I-- I-- Rose, we work together in the same building. What's the big deal? You know me. And it's Christmas Eve. I don't have any real liquor. I just have eggnog. No, I love eggnog. Let's do it. OK. OK. -Do you have family in the city? -No. My family's all down in Florida. So it's just me here. Great place. You live here all by yourself? It's my mother's house. Well, here we are. I'll get the eggnog. You know, Rose, I find you very sexy. Thank you. I'm gonna get the nog. You're not attracted to me? No, um, t-- uh, I'm attracted to you. But it-- you know, it's going a little fast for me. OK. Let's just start with a kiss. All you have to do is say stop. And I promise I will. OK. OK. You promise? Yes. OK. Stop. -All right. That was a little quick. Yeah, I know it was-- but I'm-- I-- I-- How long has it been, Rose? What? How long it's been since you've been on a date. Um. You're a very beautiful woman. You should be with someone-- someone like me. You know, you work all the time. I never see you go out. You know? You got to live a little. Life ain't that bad, Rose. You just got to lighten up. Relax. Oh, gosh. I just-- oh. I-- it's just not working for me. What did I say? Someone tells me to lighten up and relax, I just tighten up and get tense. Hey, I just thought we could have a good time. Yeah, me too, but-- I was just trying to make you feel better. I know. I know. It-- it didn't though. I see. I guess I better go. Yeah. OK. -I'm sorry. -No, no, no. I'm sorry. I was-- I was too forward. I was wrong. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. It's not you. It's me. You're right, Rose. It is you. Merry Christmas, Rose. Merry Christmas. Yeah. Deck the halls with halls with balls of-- Da-da-da-- hey, you OK? Oh, my stomach's a little nauseous. I think I'm just stressed out. Nina, can you please just relax? Look, it's the glam rock look. Deck the halls with da-da-da-da. La-la-la-la. Hey! What are you doing home so early? You must be Mike. Surprise. What are you doing? This was a surprise for you, you idiot! I bit my lip. What's going on with this guy, Nina? You can clean up here. What the hell is he doing in the apartment? You have a serious problem, my friend. Oh, I got a problem. What's he doing in the apartment? Are you insane? Who is that guy, Nina? This guy's my friend. He was helping me to prepare a surprise for you. What kind of surprise? He's a tree decorator! All right. Look, I'm-- I'm sorry. All right? I made a-- I made a mistake. You know what? You always make a mistake. Last week, you started a fight on the street because you thought a guy was looking at me. He was looking at you. The world may look at me. Get over it. All right. Look, I'm sorry. All right? It was just a misunderstanding. It's just-- it's just driving me crazy. I saw-- I saw the two of you talking today- Talking when? When I dropped you off at work today. I dropped you off at the office, and I saw you guys. Do you spy on me? No, don't spy on you. Listen to me, I just-- I saw the two of your talking. OK? And the next thing I know, you're hugging and you're kissing on each other. You know what? Hugging and kissing my wife. Innocent, all right? Believe me. Completely. She was thanking me. Thanking you for what? This is insane. Look, I could clear everything up. All right? Oh, that's not the point, believe me. I'm gay. All right? Nina, look. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Come on. Mr. Calvert! Mr. Calvert! Mr. Calvert, your rent is due, Mr. Calvert. I evict you if I have to. I evict you. Yep. She told me was gonna stay with you. I don't know. Yeah, I don't know. Look, uh-- look, just tell her I called, OK? And tell her I love her. And, uh-- And, uh-- Tell her I'm sorry. Bye. What the hell you doing here? I need to see you. I have to talk to you. Look, pal. You picked a bad day to mess with me, all right? Now, you obviously got me mixed up with somebody else. No, I just need 10 minutes of your time. No, I'm not gonna give you 10 seconds. Now, you beat it. -10 minutes. That's all I ask. I'll explain everything to you. Then I won't bother you anymore. Look, it's Christmas Eve, all right? Don't you have some place to be? Family waiting for you or something? What do you want from me? 10 minutes. Please. All right, come on. 10 minutes. Let's go, quick. This is for you. It's not much. Just something I-- I wanted to-- it's a little, um-- Thanks. All right, take a seat. Could I have something warm to drink? Yeah. You want some coffee? -Yeah. That would be very kind of you. Thanks. Listen, I-- I-- I didn't mean to frighten you before. I hope I didn't. It's just-- I was afraid I was never going to see you again. Look, you know, it's obvious you got me mixed up with somebody else. You know, I'm just trying to figure out what's going on here. Nothing personal though, Mr.-- Artie. Mm. Almond butter cookies. Your favorite, right? Right. May I have one? Yeah, sure. So heavy. Hello, we're here. Thank you. Are you all right? Mm. I might be pregnant. Oh, congratulations. Thank you. But actually, I just left my fiance, who I'm supposed to marry in one week, and who I love very, very much, but who is a jealous psychopath who things that every guy wants to sleep with me, and who drives me crazy. You must think I'm some crazy person, blurting all of this out. Oh, no. No. Not at all. You know, because I'm a blurter myself. Sometimes, you know, you just have to get it out so that you can figure out what to do. Thank you. I'm Nina, by the way. Nice to meet you. Rose. Uncle Pedro's friend from Pittsburgh, right? Dinner's ready. Let's go inside. Do I look like I've been crying? No, no, no. You look beautiful. But I-- I-- I really. Let's go have some fun. I have to go. I really-- Nina, Nina, por favor. I could use a hand inside. Come on. No, no, no, no, no. Oh, please. Maria, come on. Everyone's at the table. Um, maybe there's somewhere I could use the bathroom. -Oh yeah, right behind you. -Thanks. Thank you. Why not? Yeah. OK. Yeah. Wait, Rose. Rose, wait. -Oh, I'm so sorry. -Wait. Really. That was so stupid. I-- I apologize. -Stay with us please. -I feel so stupid. Please stay with us. Please come back inside. Tell your-- No, tell your family I am so sorry. Sorry for what? For crashing your Christmas dinner, for trespassing, for breaking and entering, for being just crazy, for-- Please come back inside. We'll make room. I'm sorry. That is so sweet, but I'm-- I-- Please. I-- I don't-- I don't fit in. Me neither. Not tonight. I know a place around the corner. Maybe we can go there and talk. They're gonna miss you. Yeah. I'll come back. OK? You're crazier than I am. Come on. It's freezing. It's so cold. Once again it's Christmastime. I'm not feeling chipper. 'Cause my girlfriend just left me for a male stripper. She says I'm a total dweeb, and I have no money. I know he loves me. And he's a great guy with a huge heart. Otherwise, I wouldn't be with him. But he's just so-- Controlling? Yes, controlling. He doesn't have faith in what we have, how we feel. He wouldn't trust it. I mean, I find myself praying that he will change. But I don't know anymore. I mean, we are supposed to get married in one week. This is it. This is forever. And I can't live like this. But I can't picture my life without him either. You love him very much. Yeah. So much. We even decided that we were going to try to have a baby, since we just got the apartment. We both want a baby very badly, even though it's a long shot. I thought you were pregnant. Yeah. To tell you the truth, I'm not sure. Well, then you have to take a test and find out. Doctors have always told me that I have a very low chance of getting pregnant. And I thought I was a few times before, and then I wasn't. So I don't want to take another test and be disappointed again. Besides, I know I'm just nauseous from all the stress of everything going on. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. We're having a little impromptu contest. Winner takes home the stunning Christmas tree on my piano. Just step up to the mic and tell us why you hate Christmas. Best reason wins. All those interested, follow me. Look, all I know is that, um, nobody's perfect. And if you find love-- I mean, real love, you just don't throw it away without a hell of a fight. Yeah. Yes. My wife used to do that with her coffee. It was her one vice, if you can call it that. It was more like a simple pleasure, really, was to put a little brandy in her evening coffee-- and B&B, just the way you do it. Who are you? Look, you-- you've been very, very kind to me. And I-- I owe you an explanation. It's just very hard for me to get the words out of what I was like-- Oh, he's home. Ho, ho, ho. Merry Christmas, Mikey. What are you doing here? -Merry Christmas. -What am I doing here? I've come to cheer you up, man. Look, this is Holly and Merry. Hi. Mikey, Mikey, get it? Holly and Merry? Come on. Christmas? Dennis, I'm not sure this is such a good time right now. What's wrong? Oh, this is such a good idea. Yeah, the girls room is right around the corner here. Look, right there. Look. I'm not-- I'm not sure this is such a good time. Look what I brought you. Yeah, but-- but Dennis. Mikey, I get the redhead. OK? What's going on here, Mikey? That's the guy from the diner. What's he doing here. I'm-- I'm trying to get to the bottom of this thing. You invited him to your apartment, Mikey. What are you thinking? I don't know what I was thinking. He could be some sort of psycho. No, no. He's not a psycho. A little strange, maybe. But he's sweet. Sweet? Mike, it there something you want to tell me? What are you talking about? I'm just-- I'm just trying to figure out what's going on with this guy. Listen, I'm your partner. You can tell me anything. I can handle it. Girl, you are so-- We're back. Dennis, you gotta hear me out here. Look, girls, Dennis-- -Are you leaving? I really appreciate you coming by, and your concern and everything. -Yeah, yeah, yeah. But really, I gotta-- I gotta get to the bottom of this. Look, I don't trust this guy. OK? Oh, come on. He's not coming with us? -I'm on my cell if you need me. -Nah, I'll be all right. I'll be fine. -Mike, I'm on my cell. OK? I'll be fine. What? I find that I'm very attracted to you. Well, wait a minute. I'm not gay. I'm not gay either. I like women. I love women. No, I mean, I really like women. I love women too. And I'm getting married. I'm getting married really soon to a really great woman that I love very much. I was married once to a woman that I really loved. And that woman was you. Excuse me? Do you believe in reincarnation? How could you not? When I looked at you, when you looked at me, I knew it was she. I knew it was my Angeline-- my wife. All right, that's it. You're out of here. -No, no. No, you're out of here. No, my wife. Stay away from me. Please! Don't do this to me. Come on in, baby. The car's warm. It's freezing. What's the matter, Dennis? You're no fun tonight. -Yeah, just give me one second. OK? It's just I don't trust this guy with my partner. Something's wrong. What do you mean, "one sec"? Oh, nothing's wrong. He's a big boy. Something's wrong. I know it. Give me a minute. Just give me a minute. I don't trust this guy with my partner. Come on, Dennis. Is he serious? Son a bitch. I knew it. Come on. No, no, Dennis. My goodness, look at-- All right. Listen, I gotten straighten this guy out. I gotta. No, you have to say in here. I-- aye, aye, aye. Look what I do for my friends. My God. Oh, just-- I gotta. All right. Listen, I gotta straighten this guy out. You got some lipstick on you there. Just stay here. Stay in the car. I'll be right back. I'll be right back. Oh, come on. Dennis, wait in the car? Nina. What's the matter? I really love you. But your jealousy is killing me. You hold on so tight, I can't breathe. That's because I love you so much though. Too much. Come on, that's crazy. Come on. No, it's not. You have to let go, Mike. If we're gonna make it then you have to let go a little. I do have another life, a career, a job where I have to talk to men. There's nothing the matter with that. Yeah. But all these guys want is to take you to bed. So some of them try. So what? You have to trust me. Who? Who what? What guys try? -No. -No, are they friends of mine? Do I know these guys? I didn't say that. Are they guys from your work? Did I-- did I ever meet them? Mike, did you hear a word that I said? What guys? Who are they? Why the hell did I come here. Come on, listen to me. I don't want to talk to you. I'm not talking to you. You're gonna have to talk to me. I'm sorry, I wasn't listening. -Hey, Mikey. -Taxi! Mikey, your friend here is waiting in the doorway hiding. I wasn't hiding. I wanted to be near you. I thought you might come down again. Not now, Artie. I love you. I was married to him. Please, Nina. Please come on. Don't-- don't leave. Didn't I tell you to wait in the car? Get in the car. Please stay here, all right? This is all your fault. Why do you keep doing thing to me? You're my life. You stay away from me. You hear me? I'm warning you. Stay away from me. All right, all right. -Do you understand me? -It's OK. It's OK. Shit. Mikey, what'd you do? I didn't do anything. Get an ambulance. Get an ambulance. OK. And our last contestant is Miss Rose Harrison. All right. Let's see. I hate Christmas because, uh-- well, you know, actually, I don't completely hate Christmas. I-- I-- there's, quite frankly, a lot of things I love about Christmas-- those little dome things that you shake with the in it. -Boo. -Right. Right. OK, sorry. Um, OK. I got pregnant the summer that I turned 25. And it wasn't something that my husband and I really planned. But, you know, we always wanted kids. So we were thrilled. And we found that we were gonna have a little girl. And, um, we painted the room pink with little bunnies and all that. And we named her after our maternal grandparents, Olivia May. And, uh, the pregnancy was great. And the delivery was great. And when she came out of me, she looked perfect. She had just these little tiny, tiny little fingers-- all of them, and little toes, and she was blonde, and-- you know, I don't know what color eyes she had, because, um-- well, I never-- um, I never saw her eyes, because she, um-- well, she-- her heart stopped. It just stopped. And they told us that it was defective. And, um, I tried to get pregnant again after that. And it didn't happen. And so I guess that's why I hate Christmas sometimes, when I think of Olivia May. That's a sad story, lady. But what's that got to do with Christmas? Oh, right. She, um-- Olivia May was born and died on Christmas Day. Don't you die on me, Artie. A woman in the Bronx killed her husband, and then turned the gun on herself. The woman left a note by the scene saying just one line, "This is something I just wanted to do for myself." Coming up, drink all the eggnog, eat all the fruit cake you want, and still lose weight? On the house, lady. Sound too good to be true? We'll have details on this controversial new diet, coming up when we return. Time is obviously running out to buy that last minute Christmas present. There are only a few hours left to shop-- So where the hell does this guy live? Arizona? He lives wherever he can. He's a squatter-- moves around a lot. Don't worry, you'll see what I mean. I don't know if I like this, Glenn. You just gotta trust me on this one, all right ? This guy will take care of you. Well, what if I change my mind. You know, I don't give a shit what you do. I got my money. Who's that? It's Glenn. Glenn, welcome. Um, I got somebody here to see you. Well, come on down and bring him over. All right. You go. I'll wait here. You're not gonna go with me? It's cool. Don't worry about it. Hi. So what can I do for you, son? Well, Glenn said that-- Glenn said what? Glenn said that you break hands. Yes. That's absolutely right. And whose hands are we talking about? Mine. Oh, jeez. Oh, I'm so-- oh, oh. I'm sorry. No, I'm-- my fault. Everything OK? I'm fine. Just maybe a few too many Christmas parties. But-- you meant me, didn't you? Right. I was just checking. Um, so how's Helen? Well, her blood pressure is, uh, still a little high. But it's much improved since this morning. Good. Oh, good. But she's still not eating. And I'm very concerned about that. If she doesn't eat something tonight, we're going to have to insert a feeding tube. Oh don't worry about that. She's going to eat tonight, because we've got big plans, don't we? Mother And I, for Christmas Eve, we're going to sing some carols, and eat some cake, and sip some nog, and light the Christmas tree. Sounds fun. It does sound like fun, doesn't it? What do you think, Mom? Do you think it's going to be fun? I think so. Oh, look at her, how beautiful she was. Hm? She still is. Mm. And me, I was such timid little kid-- you would not beli-- the-- my first of kindergarten, I got one look at the nuns, and I just-- I would not go in. A Mom here, she took my hand, and she brought me inside. And she said she would stay. And sure, when I sat in my little desk and I looked out the window, I could see her waiting there for hours leaning against her car. And I was OK because I knew she was there for me. And now I'm going to be there for her. I just-- I-- I don't know that she knows that I am though, you know. She knows you're here, Rose. I know that's hard to see. But she knows. Your mother's lost her memory and her ability to recognize people. But one thing she'll never lose is her emotion. She can sense. And she can feel. I know that. That's why we tell the families to touch them, talk to them. I know I'm telling you things you already know. But, uh, you know, sometimes you forget. Thanks. You're welcome. I'm gonna come back a little later and, uh, check on her. All right. Let's start the celebration with some carrot cake, huh? Let's see. Here we go. Just a little nibble. Here you go, Mom. Come on. Please? Come on. Did you hear the doctor? It's really important that you eat, OK? Let's just try. Just a little nibble. Please? Come on. Why won't you eat anything? Oh, God. OK, let's do the tree. Look what I won, Mom? Huh? Nice tree. It'll cheer up the room. Uh, OK. Let's see. You like that, mom. Hm? Merry Christmas. Uh, hold on. I'll get it. I can fix it. Let's see. Just a little bit of-- what the hell's wrong with this thing? Ah. Just get this. I'm gonna fix it, don't worry. Dammit. I love you. Get him in room 2. What's going on in here? It's a pileup on the West Side Highway. Save him! He needs help. I got it, sir. I'll be right with you. I'm looking for my mother. Miss, would you just sit down? She was involved in an accident on the highway. Come over here. Her name is Evelynn Gent. I guess there's gonna be a party now. Not tonight, sweetie. Sorry. I'll try to scrounge up some leftover eggnog for you. All right? It sure wasn't like this when I was 14. That was the best Christmas I ever had. Yeah, that's great. Excuse me. Excuse me, but I've been for hours. Is there any news on Artie Venizelos yet? You're gonna have to talk to Nurse Stein. Excuse me, I was hoping you can give me some news on Artie Venizelos. Are you family? No, not really. I just, uh-- Either you are or you're not. I'm-- I'm a friend. Then I'm sorry. I can't give out any medical information. He's his friend. You know, like his friend-friend. I don't care if he's his priest. If he's not family. -OK. Thank you, Nurse Ratchet. Listen, I will find out what I can. OK? -Aw, man. I really appreciate it. But, you know, but the truth of it is, we're not even really friends. Really? It's OK. I figured that. Can't swim. Would love to learn. You're the guy from the hospital? Yeah, Charlie Boyd. You're the angel lady. What are you doing here? Did you follow me? No, not at all. Well then-- well, why are you here? I could ask you the same question. I just want you to leave me alone. Can't do that. I see a woman standing alone on a pier, looking over a ledge, I got to help. I don't want any help. Well, if you jump in, I'm gonna have to jump in right after you. Who said anything about jumping in? But if I did jump, you'd jump in after me, after you told me that you can't swim? Yeah. Because it's the right thing to do. And you always do the right thing? Yeah, I do. It's a bad habit. Do you want to tell me your sad story? I'm a really good listener. I'm all ears. Good. I'll tell you mine. It's Christmas Eve. And I'm all alone. That's it. You're all alone. That's the best you can do? There's more. I'm a priest. Really? Yeah, for 20 years. Then last year, I left the priesthood-- kicked the habit. Started my life over. Now, here I am. No more Catholic family, no personal family here-- no one. Wow. Now, you want me to guess yours? Take your best shot. You're an attractive lady who forgot her hat. And your ears are very cold. Bingo. Ha. Take anything off the top shelf. Want to get a cab, and get a cup of coffee? And I'll guess more of your story. After you. Still my turn to guess, Rose? You're this amazing person. But you're too busy helping others to see it. You take good care of your friends, right? Thanks. Is he a close friend? What's the matter? Just kind of a bad stomach. Oh, it hurts. Hope we get some place soon. I don't feel so good. Well, my place is actually not far from here. Do you want to go there? Oh, you sure? Yeah. Driver, three lights, take a left. Hey, you know, I really appreciate you doing this. Aw, man, I'm glad I could help. I know hospital policy isn't always on our side. They can be a little stuffy. I remember when my lover got sick. Hey, wait-- wait a minute. You made a mistake, uh, Randy. Yeah, you're making the wrong assumption about Artie and I. I mean, I app-- I appreciate you bringing me up here and all. But the truth of it is, we ain't a couple. And as a matter of fact, I just met the guy the other day. He-- he's a waiter. And I ordered some coffee. Oh my God, that's how my parents met. My mother waited on my father, only he ordered a tuna fish sandwich and a ginger ale. It was just-- No, now look. I just-- I want to-- I want to make it clear that-- Don't worry. Your secret's safe with me. Oh, he's stable now. Just thank God for small blessings, right? Let him know you're here. I don't care what the doctors say. Talk to him. Tell him how you feel. He'll hear you. Uh, Mike. We got to talk. Oh hey. My, my. Who's that? Nah, forget about it. What do you got? Uh, listen. I went to the station. I got some info on this guy. Did you know your friend here served four years on a 10-year sentence for manslaughter back in '79? This guy. Yeah, that's him. It was a domestic dispute. This, uh, Venizelos comes home, finds his wife with another guy, right? But, uh, it's no boyfriend or nothing , just an old friend. He goes into a rage, accuses her of being unfaithful. Right? Him and this guy get into some words. They start going at each other. He throws the guy down a flight of stairs. The guy's neck breaks. He died in the hospital a few hours later. Wait, it gets worse. The wife takes off before the cops show up, right? She jumps in a car and speeds away. She's doing, like, about 80 when she skids out on this icy curve and hits an oncoming car head on. She was killed instantly. Mike. Oh, Mikey. You all right? Yeah. Yeah. I'm OK. Well, at least we know who the nut is now, right? Nah, he's not nuts. Yeah, whatever. Come on. Let's get out of here. I'll take you home. Nah, I'm-- I'm-- I'm gonna stay around here for a while. For what? They can take care of him. Come on, let's get out of here. Dennis, listen to me. Something's going on here. I don't-- I'm n-- I don't know what it is. But I'm gonna find out. I appreciate you coming by, and everything. But I got-- I got to figure this one out. You gonna be all right? Yeah. I'm gonna be all right. All right. All right. Merry Christmas, partner. Huh? Merry Christmas. Whoa, I didn't see nothing. What is it with this guy? You don't even want to know. All right. Later. Take care. This is really hot. Be careful. It's tea with bitters. It's good for your stomach. Thanks for letting me come here. Oh, sure. Yeah, it's not right, you know. I should be the one helping you. Oh no, I'm the one that always takes care of everybody, remember? -Yeah. My thing. There must be something you need though. I mean-- What do you mean? Well, what do you want most in the whole world, Rose? I guess just to make it through the night would be nice. Now we're talking. I can definitely help with that. Did I just invite myself to spend the night? Sort of. Eh, maybe I should go. No. Stay. You sure? Yeah. On condition that you tell me what it is that you want. That's fair. I don't want to be alone when I die. Was that too much? No. No. No. OK. You sure that's him? Doctor, believe me. He was just here this morning. So you think that it was self-inflicted? Absolutely. Well, if that's the case, we can hold him for up to 24 hours for observation if we think he's a danger to himself. Have the residents psychiatrists have a talk to him before we decide to let him go. OK. Look, if there's not gonna be a party, I want to go now. You can't leave right now. Why? You have to speak to another doctor. For what? Those are the rules. Look, you can't just keep me here. I can't. But he can. Now, sit down. Charlie, I hope you don't mind my asking, but, um, why did you leave the priesthood after 20 years? I lost my faith. And I began to question the existence of God. If you're a priest, that's not good. So here I am. I'm sorry. It's all right. What about you? What about me? How's your faith? -Oh, it's pretty shaky. -Really? Why? Well, my mom's been sick for a long time with Alzheimer's. And she was always the glue that kind of kept the family together. Now, she can't even bathe herself. And I keep trying to reconnect with her. How do you do that with someone who's not there? Well, I put-- I put pictures of the family all around the room. And I bring her her favorite foods, I play her favorite music. You know, I'm just trying to find her, just even for, like, a second, just to have some kind of moment of clarity, you know? So that I know she's still there? Does it work? No. Do you pray? No. Not anymore. Yeah. I know how that is. Only five more hours to go. 'Til what? 'Til you make it through the night. This is mesmerizing. Not for five hours. No, nope. You should put another tape on. How you doing? Sorry, dude. Look, I want to go home now. All right? This is all wrong. This is not the way it's supposed to be. Calm down, Mr. Calvert. Oh, oh. You want me to calm down? -Calm down, Mr. Calvert. -All right. You want me to calm down? I can calm down. Is that calm enough for you? What about that? Sir. Get him on the other side. Hey, what are you doing? I got a broken hand. You-- I didn't-- I didn't do anything wrong. Let me go. You know, Artie, I got to tell you. You know, I feel really bad about what happened at the apartment today. And I want you to know that, you know, I wasn't mad at you. I wasn't mad at you. I was-- I was mad-- man, Artie, I really screwed things up between Nina and me. You have no idea. Actually, you probably do, don't you? Hey, Artie. I gotta know-- you know, that-- that stuff you were saying today about you and me, you know? About your wife. That was, uh-- that's just crazy, right? It's just some big-- some big misunderstanding, right? Who are you? I'm a friend. Uh, I've never met you before-- Paul Venizelos. Michael Riley. I'm the guy that took him here. I'm a cop. Oh, thank you. Yeah. So how's he doing? You know, he's stable. All right. Well, thanks for sitting with him. It was good to meet you. Yeah. Of course. Mike. Yeah? He didn't give you some cockamamie story about you being my reincarnated mother, did he? He did, didn't he? He's been doing that to some poor unsuspecting chump every Christmas since she died. Well, look, I promise I'll let him know that you were here when he wakes up. All right? Yeah. I appreciate it. I can't believe you're still here. So he likes to tell people they're your reincarnation mother, huh? Yeah. Always around Christmas. Look, I'm sorry about your mother, and all that happened. He told you what happened? Yeah, a little. You know, he mentioned it once. Wow. My father never talked about that. Yeah. Well, anyhow, I'm sorry. Pop, you know, he just can't seem to forget it. It's the past that holds onto him. We don't count. No matter what we do, no matter how much we try to be there for him, we just can't reach him. And I can't reach him. Do you know he still keeps that glass angel by his bed? I swear, he sees her face in it. Glass angel? Yeah. My mother had it blown of glass to put on top of the tree. Was surprise for Pop. Sounds like they loved each other very much. They did. All my father's looking for is a little forgiveness, huh? Where's the harm in that? Forgiveness from who? From her. He screwed up. And he's sorry. He just never got a chance to tell her. I gotta take a walk. I'll be right back. Keep an eye on him? Yeah. You got it. Morning. Morning. How you feeling? Rose-- Charlie, if you have to leave, I understand. Really, it's fine. I-- I-- look, I made it through the night, didn't I? Yes, you have. But is that you really wanted? Just to make it through the night, and that's all? Well, I suppose I'd like to think that my life matters. Oh, you life matters. You've touched other people's lives in ways you don't even realize. How do you know that? Because you touched my life. You're just being nice, Charlie. -No, Rose. I'm not. It's more than that. You saved me, Rose. I was wondering were God was. And then the next thing you know, there you are-- the bedside of a complete stranger, telling him you love him with such meaning. And then I knew, God was there in that room with you. You were there? Yeah. Why did you do that, Rose? I-- 'cause he was just so alone. And I guess I know what it feels like. I know. That's why your mother wants you to let go and live a life. What? Your mother wants you to live your life, Rose. You don't know my mother. She knows you love her and you're there for her. Why are you doing this? Because she told me to tell you. That's not funny. And you're scaring me. No, Rose. Listen, I don't have much time. This is scary. It's not-- no. Rose, please listen to me. Charlie, please. I don't want to listen. Please, you-- listen to what I have to say. I'm not gonna listen. Get out of the house. I don't want you here anymore. You don't know my mother. I want you to go. I'm not gonna leave 'til you hear what I have to say. She spoke to me last night. All right. I'm calling the police. I know it's hard to believe. Now is the time to live. I mean it, Charlie. Get out. That's what she wants. I know-- I'm dialing. I know that would make her happy. Happy? Happy? My mother doesn't even know she's my mother. She doesn't hear me. She doesn't see me. Do you understand what I'm saying? When you look in her eyes, you see absolutely nothing. She's not there. Do you understand what I'm saying? I'm watching my mother die bit by bit. So don't you tell me about my mother. Get out of here. Just go. I love you, Rose. Did you do that yourself, Jules? No. Well, there are some people here at the hospital that think you might have. -Hey, look. This is bullshit. I mean, do I have to go through with this? If you want to leave, yes. All right. Fine. I'll play this game. Um, well my dad died when I was real young. My mother married some guy with quick hands who didn't have time for me. So he hit you? Yes. A lot? When he felt like it. They still married? I heard he died years ago, which made be very happy. When was the last time you spoke to your mother. I told you, I don't have a mother. I want to help you, Jules. But unless you tell me the truth, I can't. So tell me, did you do that to your hand? Yes. Why? Look, by the time I was 14, I was taking a beating every day. And once, it got so bad, he even threw my mother halfway across the room. And that's when I told him to stop. That's all I said-- stop it. And you know what he did? He broke my nose in three places, and then threw me out of the house. And after they fixed me up, the hospital called my mother. And she never showed, never even picked me up. If she'd have just given me a little hint that she wanted me to stay, that she cared, something, I would've stayed. But you know what? I felt that she chose him over me. And I wasn't going to stick around for that. Maybe she was scared, Jules. Maybe she was just as scared as you when she allowed those things to happen to you. She might have been happy when you ran away, because she knew he couldn't hurt you anymore. Maybe she loved you that much. Why don't you call her? I'm sure she'd love to hear from you. I can't. It's just a phone call, Jules. No one should be stuck in an emergency room on Christmas if they don't want to be. Be back in a few minutes. I thought I was never gonna see you again. Hey. Long time no see. Yeah. Should I-- should I get the nurse? No. What are you still doing here? I was waiting for you to wake up. Thanks so much for helping me out. I-- I'm very, very grateful. You're welcome. Artie, listen to me. I want you to know something. I forgive you. You understand? It's over. I forgive you for everything. Looks like there's somebody here to see you. Hello, son. Hey, Pop. You OK? Nina, dear. I'll be right there. Aye, Nina, come and see what I see what I see. What are you doing here? Listen, I've been thinking about what you said last night, about being scared. I shouldn't have said it like that. No. I know what you meant. But you're wrong. I'm the one that's scared, not you. Because it's-- it's-- it's not that I don't trust you, Nina. I don't trust who I am, you know? What you see in me. You know, I'm just a cap. You know? You know, I-- I don't have a fancy suit, or a fancy degree on the wall. I don't-- I don't have the words to make all the things I did go away. I wish I did. But I don't. I just know I want to spend the rest of my life with you. Oh, Michael. Look, if you don't want to get married, that's fine. You don't want to see me anymore? All right. You don't even know if you love me anymore, well, I'll just have to accept that. Because you're more important to me than-- than us. But if you give me one more chance-- I know I've said this before, but this time, this is for life. I won't let you down. I wont-- I won't let you down. You have to believe me. I've changed. I'm not the same anymore. Mike. You don't have to say anything right now. I just-- I want you to think about what I just told you. You know, it's like you used to tell me. I mean, this is it. This is forever. And I want you to be sure. OK? All right. And you know what? One more thing. Whatever you decide, be happy. Because that's more important to me than anything. Excuse me, nurse. Have you seen the gentleman that visits this patient. No one comes to visit him. I've never seen anyone. His friend's name is Charlie Boyd. And I-- I saw him here myself yesterday morning. You're mistaken, ma'am. This is Charles Boyd. And no one has ever come to see him. Excuse me, I have rounds to make. Charlie? Oh my God. It is you. Hey, Charlie. Charlie, hi. It's OK. I'm here now, Charlie. You can leave now. It's OK to let go. Look what you forgot. Thank you, Charlie. Hi. Hi. Can I come in? Yeah. Come on in. I thought I'd come by and give you your gift. Where is it? It's right here. Merry Christmas, Mike. Really? Really? Yes. Yeah. Oh, I love you. I love you. So will you marry me now? Yeah. Let's get married. Oh my God, I missed you. I love you so much. So Helen, do you think your daughter would go out to dinner with me? You know, I was hoping you might put in a good word for me. What do you think? I'm a nice Jewish doctor, aren't I? She's eating. Rose! Mom! You're eating. That's so great. Congratulations. I was just-- we were just. You're talking. I know that. She's a great listener. Yeah, she is. I suppose I should continue my rounds. Oh, uh, doctor-- um, what's your first name? Matthew. Matthew. That's Matthew, Mom. Uh, I'm sorry about what you heard when I was talking to your mother. You know, as a doctor you say things to your patients that-- You don't really mean? No, no. It's just that sometimes-- You don't-- you don't want to take me to dinner? No. Oh. I mean, yes. I would like to take you to dinner. Oh, well good. Because, um, well, I-- I think-- I think that's a good idea. Really? Yes. That's great. I would really like that. Me too. Merry Christmas, Rose. Merry Christmas, Matthew. You too, Helen. Well, he seems like a-- a good guy. What do you think, mother? Do you like him? Merry Christmas, Mom.
