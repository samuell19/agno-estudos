Hey, excuse me for not wanting to get caught. Well, you're talking to this year's Tolo queen, Samantha. You really think I'm gonna get caught? We're all good here. Here. Yeah. All right. It is now time for all you Montagues to find your Capulets and mos on down to the dance floor for our very last slow dance. Hold your partner tight and squeeze them even closer, if you will. Have I ever told you how pretty you look? Only about 50 times tonight. That's 51, actually. Oh, well, I meant it every single time. Are you sure there's no way I can convince you to come out with us? I would if I could. Come on, sneak out. My dad would literally kill me. I know, but I wanna be alone with you. I know you do. How about we go somewhere a little bit more private? Like now? Where? ♪ Tell me funny stories You gotta be kidding me. You want to? Go make out in a mausoleum of dirty gem socks and god knows what else? Be still my beating heart. I can go and you follow. ♪ To keep anyone next to me - What's up, bitches? - Hey! Gotta get some before Mikki and Alana down at all. Like I believe you haven't been generously helping them down it yourself. So where's Carter? Oh, he is waiting for me. We're gonna hang out for a bit. - Damn, Ash. - Called it. Oh my God. I am not going to, you know, with, with him. We're just, we're just gonna be alone for a minute. Mm-hmm. All right. Well, I gotta say it. Stating the obvious here, Ash, but you were right about Carter Fisher and we were wrong. Yeah. I knew he would come over to the dark side eventually. They always do. Oh, Ash. Oh my Ash. Bye bye. Carter? Carter? Are you in here? Fuck! Don't do that! Why not? Because then it's gonna be lights out for you, buddy. Don't tell me that didn't get your blood pumpin'. - Hello, ladies. - Oh God. Excuse me. Thank you. Pardon? Freak. You know, I'm willing to bet that, underneath that Nancy Drew exterior, there's a leather studded corset just waiting to come out, all right? Beat it, jerk off. See, you're so good at bossing men around already. All you need is a little, little riding crop and- - She means piss off, get away, and lose it! Bye! Well, whenever you're ready. Why don't you play more of that Depeche Mode, Sigue Sigue Sputnik, whatever that garbage is. Never gonna be ready. Nice try. I love DJ. Wait, maybe I should... Oh, unless you don't want to. I mean, we don't have to. I just- Quickly. Wait, that was fast. Did you sprint through the dance? People are gonna notice that we're in here. April Fools! - Nice tits, Ash. - Holy shit. I'm sorry, Ash. I've been planning this for way too long. Oh, come on! Fuck, she's pissed. Ash? No, she'll be fine. Yeah. She's the queen of this kind of stuff. Ah, we just better watch out for her retaliation prank. However bad she got you that last time, Miles, I couldn't even imagine. You know, in a few weeks, she'll be showing people the video and laughing along with the rest of us. Wow. Ash really did go home, huh? Yeah. She must be super pissed. - No, she's fine. - Come on. How many pranks has she pulled on us over the years? Like so many. She's fine. All right, and for your last song of the night, this is a tune very near and dear to my heart. So I'm need every dance to get out there, get sweaty, get rockin', and get your bodies moving to this tune. - I gotta bleed the lizard. - Oh boy. There you go. Okay. All right, you're good. Damn champ. Ashley? This is a joke, right? Everybody get down! - Where is he? Where's he at? - I'm so sorry. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. He's, he's, he's been shot. - What? - He, he- - What happened? What happened? Mrs. Fisher, Mrs. Fisher. He's, he appears to have been shot. I'm sorry. He's on his way to the hospital. - What? No, no! - I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No! No! Yeah, I, I know Alana. I, I wanna see you, too. I just, I'm not sure it's a good time. I don't wanna be a drag. No, I know, I know it'll be fun. I just, I'm not sure. Because I can't give you a definite answer right now. Look, I, I just landed. Can I please just call you back later? Yes. Yes, yes. Alana, yes, I promise. Later, okay? Okay. Bye. I love you, too. Okay, bye. Joanne. Joanne! So you're gonna spend the whole summer stomping around Grandma's house? Fuck off. You wanna talk about it? Or that's a healthy coping mechanism, too. Well, where do you draw the line when the groove is this deep? And one. Oh, speaking of shitty existences, what's her name? Carter's mom, Mrs. Fisher. She, she says hi. She came by the other day. Felt kind of weird getting condolences from her. Jesus. I'm so glad I wasn't here. Did, did she seem okay? Yeah, she seemed fine. Just wanted to know how you girls were, what you were up to this summer, at school, you know, shit like that. God, it's just one thing after another. It never ends. Care to elaborate on that one? Like, my life hasn't had enough fucked up twists and turns for you to not pick up what I'm putting down? Oh, yeah, that's right. You oughta write a novel. Okay, like today. Even from beyond the grave, Mom has found a way to screw with my mental health. Your mother's a bitch. She'll pay for what she did to you. You know, I, I try to take some time. I'm spending my summers on campus. Per request from Dr. Mockley, I come home to try and put my shit behind me and bam. Yeah. Can't believe ma would keel over just despite you like that. Screw off. You asked. They all despised her, or at least they hated her enough to cut her out and let us deal with that bullshit. But no, now she's gone, and here they all are, saying all these nice things about her, saying how great she was, this performative fucking shit. Yeah, that's precisely the reason I didn't wanna have a wake. I knew that they would all come. And then right on cue, all the girls and Alana are blowing up my phone to go to fucking Burnt Bridge Lake like nothing. If there was just one goddamn thing I wish we would do is to talk about what is actually happening. I'm confused. Are you still complaining about Mom? All of it, everything. I don't know. Sometimes I do feel like I am completely alone, like I'm the only one standing there not pretending the world isn't turning. Is that gonna make it any better? What? Like, if you acknowledge it and, and wallow in this shit, is that gonna make you feel better? I think it would give us some closure by facing it. Filthy female cow. Make it laugh. You know, facing your problem doesn't always mean that you've conquered it. You know I love you, right? But I gotta tell ya, if you're gonna spend my summer fee fi foeing around Grandma's house, it's gonna send my brain into hyper drive mode, and the only way that I can purge that from myself is to blow it out with a bullet. You're such a dick. So unless you would like to go to another wake with all of our family members blathering on about how great and wonderful I am, I suggest that you just take a couple of deep breaths, right? You let out some woo saws, and you just go hang out with your fucking friends. I mean, for the first time in two years, just be a piece of shit like everybody else. It's gonna be really weird without Ashley there. Yeah, it probably will. How am I not supposed to imagine her in some padded room the minute we walk into that place? Not gonna lie to you. You probably will, all of you. But, I mean, isn't that what you want now? To have everybody face it? Not one of them will even mention it. Well, fuck, Sam. Do they have to? News flash, not everybody copes the same way you do, and odds are you're probably gonna end up having a good time. And even if you don't, right? Even if you get there and you feel shitty, maybe you can take some comfort in the fact that, by you being there, maybe they have less shitty of a time. It'll be your one good deed for the summer. Just, just go, Samantha. You're the strong one, remember? - Hello? - Hey! So are you still able to pick me up? - Are you gonna go? - Yeah. I think maybe getting away for a few days could be- - Oh my God, yes! Sam's coming. - Hey, you're gonna go? - Yes. Okay. I am beyond stoked. I am so excited. Yeah. Yeah, me, too. What? Oh, right, right. Do you wanna get a ride with us? Are you sure you still have room for me? Oh, yeah. Oh, Mikki's just gonna meet us there since she's coming up from Westerns.

Because it's tradition, Sam. Come on. Okay. All units be advised, there is a possible 1098, 10 niner eight issued for the greater Columbia County. All cars within broadcast range, please come back. 1098? From where? Probably Rainier Spring Psychiatric Hospital. It is the closest. Okay. - NPS car 2, 10-4. - Copy that. Aw, poor guy. I feel so bad for him. Yeah. What. he's like our dads' age? Probably his kids or something somewhere. One second. Excuse me. Hi, excuse me. I, I don't know if you maybe want something to eat, but I do have like Corn Nuts if, if you want them. I, I have like a dollar or two. Thank you. Th-th-th-thank you so much. Yeah, here you go. Thank you. God bless you young ladies. You, you wanna beer? Oh, no, no. I, I, I, I couldn't, I couldn't. - Yeah, yeah. - Here, please. Oh, God. Thanks again. This is very nice of you. You're very gracious, beautiful young ladies. This is the nicest thing I've seen in a long, long time. - Of course. - Our pleasure. The world is a better place with you all in it. Thank you. I hope you have a nice day. Here, here, w-wait a moment. I, I got this from a man in Rumaila. He was a member of the Iraqi Republican Guard, an older gentleman. He, he was injured by a mortar, and I pulled him to an American med unit, and he gave me this coin and said he got it from someone he'd given shelter to. Said next time someone does something generous for me to give 'em this coin, tell 'em to do the same, the idea of being, as long as the coin keeps moving, there's still some good in the world. I can't take this. Don't hang onto it too long. Don't let the coin stop circulating. Thank you. You girls have a wonderful day. Thank you. You, too. No, what does that mean? Okay, well, then what should we do? No, I mean, yes, yes. No, I'm glad you did too, Mom. I... No, we will, we will. If you could just keep me updated, that'd be great. Bye. Yeah, I love you. Bye. What's wrong? Well, this is fucking crazy. What? You know that emergency service announcement we got? Well, there was, there was a breakout at Rainier Springs. Wait, really? Yeah, I mean, nothing's confirmed, but my mom just wanted to see if we saw it, you know, and she just, she still thinks we should enjoy the weekend, not let it worry us too much. - Wow. - Yeah. Escaped prisoner, college girls, and a cabin in the woods? I've seen this movie before. Yeah, totally a horror movie. Yeah, great, but this isn't a horror movie. This is real life, so. And statistically, you know, a house up on Burnt Bridge Lake, it's, it's like the safest place you could be. A fucking army could roll through there and nobody would even find us. Come on. NPS car 2 to Everglade dispatch, over. Go ahead, NPS, over. Regarding the possible 1098, you've got about two officers on duty covering over 20 miles of forest road. Requesting additional information. - Shangri-La. - Hamunaptra. - Well, hello again. - Oh my God. I'm so glad my mom kept this house in the divorce! Huh. What? Goddamn key isn't here. Huh. Well, if that isn't sketchy. Oh, Ron, you moron. God. - How is your brother anyway? - Stupid. He's good. I guess they're buying a place. Still with Catherine Simmons? Yep. - How's she? - Still a cunt. Oh, yes! Oh my goodness, guys! Need another beer yet? - Come on. - What is this? What the, really? A cutting board? God, fucking Ronald. Damn brother. Stupid brother. - Here. - Hit me, too. All right. What is this to? Summer break! The answer is not on the board, Miles. Alana, you got a better one? Gettin' fucking trashed! - Yeah! - No, come on. We gotta have something better than that. Let me think. Panther squad. - Panther squad, bitches! - Ooh, Sam! - All right. - Panther squad, bitches! - Cheers. - Panther Squad. - Cheers. - Cheers. Cheer. I'm surprised Mikki isn't here. I know. I thought she'd beat us here by hours. Someone should call her. Let's see if you can find the spot, Alana. I mean, it's like right here. If Mikki's still Mikki, she's probably lost and we'll have to go find her. Remember that one 4th of July up here by ourselves and Mikki got lost at the lake when the sun was setting? Yeah, because you and her went for a walk completely shit faced, right? I wasn't. Oh, I remember you being drunk, like fucked kind of drunk. Oh, off that gross malt stuff Ron bought us. Oh God. - I was not drunk. - Found it! And then, and then we saw you guys, then we all hid, and then Ashley jumped out of the bushes at you. I knew you were there. I could hear you. And Mikki screamed so loud that she peed herself. We had to come back and put her in the bath. Fuck. God, was that the last time we were up here altogether? Yeah. Yeah, Mikki and Ashley didn't, didn't go for spring break our senior year, so- - Didn't answer. - She's probably close. Yeah, at a service range on the 101. - I call it, Miss Cleo. - Mikki! Oh, good afternoon, girls. Are your, your parents here or the owner of the residence, maybe? Well, yeah, it's my mom's house, so is there something wrong? Oh, no, ma'am. We're with the National Park Service, and we saw you guys headed up this way, and we thought we'd just, you know, stop in and, and let you guys know that there is in fact still a, a burn ban and effect in the area. So, you know, no campfires, no grilling. I don't know if you ladies or smokers, but, you know, just put your butts out before tossing 'em. Okay, thanks. Yeah, like I said, we're just, just doing a general welfare check of the area and- - You know, sorry to bother you, ladies. - Yeah. - Thank you for your time. Come on, Shawna. Okay, thanks. Oh, wait, wait. So we got that emergency service alert or whatever. - Okay. - Yeah. So do you know anything about it or? Nah, I wouldn't worry about that. Everything's okay. Was it really a prison break? Well, we don't have any concrete information right now, and nothing's been confirmed, so, again, nothing to worry about. Just have a great rest of your evening. Yeah, I mean, unless it's Bear Grylls that escaped, think you guys are in a pretty good spot. Anyway, have a great rest of your evening. Sorry to bother you ladies, and keep that drinking to a minimum, okay? - Okay. - Have, have fun. - Come on, Shawna. - Thank you. Yeah, Blue Lives Matter or whatever. Sh! Sh sh sh! What? Are you trying to get us in trouble? Oh, fuck them. You gotta be fucking kidding me. What? I've got four delicious little girls up in this cabin. I mean, what is this, the Washington Chainsaw Massacre? Well, that's what happens when you only have two peace officers covering 20 square miles of forest land. It'll be fine. What side of the bed do you want? Apologies in advance, but I just gotta say it. It's gonna be a little weird without Ashley here. I know, it's, it's... I just had to say it. No, I'm so glad you did. I've been thinking the exact same thing. It's, it's almost why I didn't come, if I'm being honest. I'm glad you decided to. I miss you, Sam. I miss you, too, and I am having fun. Me, too. Does it, does it ever make you feel guilty? You know, that you're happy? Does that even make sense? Sorta. I think I know what you mean. You know, it's like with my mom. You know, I, I feel guilty that I'm okay. Everyone keeps saying how bad they feel, and it's not that I feel good or that I'm not sad, but, you know. Yeah. Our relationship was not the best, but still, I don't know, I feel like karma is gonna come for me, and same with Ashley, you know? I mean, we, how do I say this? Nothing happened to us. You know, everyone felt bad for us. We were the victims. Everyone held our hand, and, I don't know, I feel guilty that I can come here and, and be happy, you know? And I need to know that I'm not the only one who, who sees it for what it is. I guess. But let's not let it ruin our time, you know? I don't wanna stew. It's not good for me. Of course, I wish things were different and Ashley were with us. She is. Ashley will always be with us. Hey, are you two assholes like going to bed or are you gonna come have a drink? - Yeah! - Come on! Oh, it's gonna be perfect for sunbathing. Oh, I'm fucking dying in there, dude. How do people do that? Easy peasy. No. That's not fun. - I know. - Nailed it. I don't know. It's been a long time. - You'll get used to it. - You know? or something. Hand me one of those, will ya? Ooh. This is great. - Yeah. - Yeah. Oh, I needed this. Hey, Alana. Yo. Truth or dare? Fuck. What are we, 12? Truth. Have you seen Chris since you've been back? I mean, you mean like seen, seen him? Like with your eyes. Have you talked to him? I mean, he came sulking around here when I first got back to my mom's. Really? Okay, and then what happened? - I told him to get lost. - Really? Truthfully now, Alana. Am I speaking Norwegian? I told him to never contact me again. Okay. I guess we must've heard wrong then. All right, your turn. Okay. Miles. Truth or dare? Truth. Okay, what's the craziest thing you've done since starting college? - Craziest? - Or, or big or unexpected? I mean, I came out to my dad. - Really? - No shit. How did it old Pastor Pat take that one? Pretty well, actually. He kind of knew. - That's good. Congrats. - Yeah. All right, Sam. Truth or dare? Dare. Oh shit, I don't really have a dare. Let me think. I, I dare you to- - Fuck it. Truth then. - Okay, good. In the case of an emergency, like let's say that escaped ex murderer comes around, who here do you trust the least? - Barb. - What? I'm sorry. I love you, but yeah, of everyone here, it's you. All right, thank you for that. Okay, well then, it's my turn, and Barb, truth or dare? Truth, truth. After all of this time, how do you feel about what happened? Honestly, I tried everything to not think about it at all. Can I ask why? I don't think it would help. Jesus Christ, you guys! Can't somebody like dare someone to go eat a worm and streak around the backyard? Okay, fuck Alana, go eat a worm or something. Don't fuck with me. I will do it. I will eat that worm. Fuck Sloan, marry Dr. Owen, kill Shepherd. Wow, okay. Marry Dr. Owen, huh? He seems like he'd be a good husband and father. He was in the military, so you'd always be safe. - Hey, you doing okay? - Yeah, yeah, sure. You just seem upset all of a sudden. I think I'm just having a moment. It's really weird being here. Just kind of sinking in. Yeah, but you can't let it ruin your time. How can it not? You know, I thought coming here after all this time, we'd get some kind of closure, but instead we're sitting here in, in this place, pretending like the whole world didn't just happen. Who's pretending? Sam, there's not gonna actually be any ever like real closure. I mean, once the door's open, it's open forever. Come on, you guys. I guess I'm just disappointed that we're not even gonna talk about it. Why? Because I think it would help. It's fucking morbid is what it is. Forget it. We'll just go back to pretending. Okay, I'm gonna get another drink. Who wants another drink? What is your problem? My problem? Everyone here is laughing and giggling and carrying on, and sure, that's been great, but I kind of hate that I am the only one who seems to feel weird and guilty for being here! You know, I really thought that we would at least talk about it. Okay, and what do you wanna talk about? How can we even talk about it? Like you want me to say that, yes, I feel like dog shit every day, Sam? - No, that's not exactly- - Do you feel better? Do you? Because I don't. Not everything is about you. No, not everything is about you. Not everyone copes the same way you do, Sam. Some of us just wanna feel normal. I just wanna feel normal again. After all these years of not seeing each other, maybe we shouldn't open old wounds. Excuse me for thinking that this trip could be therapeutic. Maybe then we could stop going around pitying ourselves. I go around pitying for myself? I gotta tell you, girl, that's fucking hilarious. You go around trying to fix everyone else's problems when guess what? Nobody asked you to. You know, whatever. Fuck it, Barb. Sam! You don't know me at all anymore! Actually, Sam, we know you better than anyone else, and that's why you're being such a bitch right now. Look, I'm really sorry that I reacted like that, so I don't- Hey Barb. I'm a bitch? That's fucking hilarious. You fucked up now. You fucked up now! - Barb, Barb, Barb! - Hold her back! Hold her the fuck back! Cut it out! - Oh my God. - Come on! I'll show you! Come on, Barb! I'll shut your fucking face! - Barb, come on! Come on now! - Knock it off! It's done!

My God! - I love you guys. - I love you guys, too. Yeah. I think we needed that. My whole life's become a cliche. Hey, someone should try Mikki again. I'm starting to get worried. Yeah, me, too. - What was that? - Sh. Listen. You guys, relax. It's probably nothing. Ugh. Don't even trip. Oh, wait. Seriously, you guys stop freaking me out. I'm just gonna go check. Just, just wait. Just wait for us. - Oh! - Oh my God! - Shit! - What the fuck? I'm sorry. - What you doing here? - I'm trying to scare you. No, Chris! Oh my God, you have to leave. - What? Don't be mad. - This is unbelievable. Oh, I was just trying to play a little prank. Hey! Wait. Alana. Wait. She told you to go. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Look, I just really wanted to see you again. - Again? - Hey, dude. I think we should just go. Just wait, okay? - All right. - Okay, look. Hey, you said you were coming up here. I thought that meant, you know, maybe you wanted me to stop by. You can't stay here, Chris. Okay, fine. I'll leave, but can I just see you for a second? I drove all the way out here. Look, Chris, you have to go. Can we at least just talk for a minute and then, look, okay? Fine. We will leave. Look, I'm not doing anything, Chris. Who said anything about that? I just wanna see you. Hey, look, I'll keep my hands in my pockets the whole time. I'll be a perfect, gentleman. Hi, I'm Adam. Wow, you really did a number on this place. Looks fun. - Yeah, it was. - Yeah. I'm sorry. You know, for us just showing up like this. I thought Chris was invited. That's at least what he told me. It's cool. And here I thought I was invited to this cool cabin with a house full of bunch of hot single girls. Yeah, I should've caught on that. Maybe it was too good to be true. Yeah, you probably should've. My bad. Jesus. How long is she gonna be? It's been almost 20 minutes already. Yeah, he's really hanging on tonight! - Ugh, this is boring. - You guys wanna smoke weed? I'm sorry, I just meant that I have a spliff. Do you guys wanna smoke? No. We grew up and developed real drug habits, so thanks. Right. My bad. Yeah, sorry. I'm just gonna go wait outside. Whenever they're done talking or whatever, just let Chris know I'll be out there waiting for him. Yeah, I'm just, just gonna go. Okay, now I feel bad. Hey. Hey. Yeah, sure. So how do you know Chris? We met at work, started hanging out. - Yeah? - Yeah. - Where do you work? - Classic Kitchen Buffet. We work in the back. - Cool. - Yeah. Hey, I'm sorry about crashing your party. I really didn't know that- No, no, it's fine. I'm sorry for how we reacted towards you. That really wasn't cool. It's all right. So you, you don't have to wait out here. Knowing those two, it's gonna be awhile. - Yeah. - So you can come back in and have a drink if you want. All right, cool. Thanks. I'm, I'm gonna just finish this, and then I'll come in for a minute. Okay. Sounds good. Looks like a really good talk. I don't know what you're talking about. - Hey, where's Adam? - He's outside smoking. Oh, okay. Is that a cue to exit? Adam? - I'm not cheating. - You gotta stop cheating. - I just- - Hey! Are you sure he didn't come back in here? Who? What, who? - Adam. - No, he was just right there. Well, I couldn't find him. Stay here. - Nothing, babe. - First Mikki then... You don't think- No fucking way. You guys lock the back door. Whoa. Whoa, what the fuck is wrong? Okay, there's been some really weird going on all day. Right? Where the hell is Mikki? - That's what I'm thinking. - I'm calling her right now. Okay. Hey, don't trip, all right? He's probably just out taking a piss somewhere. I didn't mean to freak you out. Okay, let's just be sure. Too many weird things have happened today to just be a coincidence, and, to be honest, I have had this kind of weird gut feeling about it all day. He's probably just down by the car taking a piss. She's still not answering. I'm, I'm gonna, just gonna call my mom. Guys, this is weird. Let's get outta here. Just wait. It's safer inside. - Hey, Mom. - Okay, can someone please tell me what the fuck is going on? Okay, you heard that emergency alert earlier? Well, Barb's mom called to tell us that somebody fucking escaped from prison, and then we get here, and now Mikki is missing. And she should've been here before we were. Okay, as always, you are overreacting, Alana. You, you and your friends, they always do this. Okay, this is serious, Chris. No one's been able to get ahold of her. Yeah, but plus these cops came by doing this weird welfare check or something. I'm trying to hear! Shh! You know, we would still be a thing if it weren't for shit like this. - Shh! - I'm just gonna- - Sh! - Wait, stop! What, Mom? No, I, I was... No, I was saying, are you sure? Okay, yeah, because she's just still answering her phone, so. Okay. I love you. Bye. What did she say? She, well, I feel like a fucking idiot now. That emergency service announcement, it's a false alarm. - Really? - Yeah, but she's gonna call Mikki's parents and see if they've heard. Thank god. Jesus Christ, I Great. Now can I go find my friend please? Yeah, go for it. Oh my God. My heart is still pounding. Yeah, yeah. I mean, we were all thinking the same thing, right? I suppose it is a little stupid. I wish my gut would agree with you. I just can't shake the... I really hope Mikki is okay. Hey, Adam! Freaking out the girls, man! I'm this close to threesome that blond girl. Where are you? Adam! Come on, man. Freaking out the girls. What's that? Shit. What's Adam's deal? I mean, I don't really know him. Why? He seemed like a nice guy. I mean, I really questioned his taste in friends, but- - Yeah, look, Sam. No. - Seriously. Yeah, we do not need another friend with a toxic boyfriend. - I'm laying right here. - Okay, calm down. It's just, I'm going to be here this summer, and he actually seemed like a nice guy. Yeah, everybody seems like a nice guy. Please, girl. Do not pull an Alana. Still right here! Oh my God. There they are. Good. Now they can leave. I thought I told you- Whoa! Call 911! - What? Stay away from the windows! Hello? Yes, I'm at 992- Run. Run! It's okay. It's okay, Miles. Miles, it's okay. Sh. I know, I know. No, no, no, no, Miles, no, sh! Miles! This is our only fucking chance. We have to run. We have to go. We have to go. Okay, okay? We're gonna make a run for it. Okay, make a run for it. Look. Okay, let's go, let's go. Track team, bitches. Ashley, we didn't mean to hurt you. Please! Please! Sam, Sam. We have to lock ourselves in here. Come on. No, we have to lock the front door. I heard him leave. Just, I'll be right back. Oh, fuck it then. Use the deadbolt. Do you have your phone? No, no. I, I don't, I don't know where it is. Jesus. Oh fuck, I thought we were all dead. We have to lock the back door and the windows. No, we need to call somebody. I know, I know. Oh my, oh my God. Sh sh sh sh sh, hey, hey, hey. Hey. Where is Miles and Alana? They made a run for it, I think. Whose is that? I dunno. It's Mikki's wallet. Ashley, is, is this because of Ashley? Or if it was a fucking coincidence, it wasn't! Okay, when I open this door, I need you to slam it behind me. I'm gonna go to the car. I'm gonna get in. I'm gonna bring it up to the front of the house as close as I get to the front door. And then whatever you do, whatever you do, do not lock this door because if they are out there, I'm gonna have to get in quick, but once I'm back, we can go into the car and get out. Okay, as soon as you pull up, I'll get right over to the car. Okay, but I'm gonna get this thing up there, no matter what is out there, so I don't want you to come out running into a buzz saw. I can take care of myself. Okay, all right. Are you ready? Wait. Do you hear something? Okay. Go. Oh God. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, Ashley. Ashley, please, please, please. Fuck you up! No! No! No! Stop! Stop! You're fucked up! Stop, stop! Fucking stop! Take off your mask! Take off your fucking mask now! I wanna see your face. Mrs. Fisher. You little bitch. - Why? How, how could you? - My son is dead. Do you know what it's like to lose the person that you love? The people that just laugh and they play? Well, everybody's like, "Oh, poor them, poor them." Yeah. They're so sad. That's why you didn't even have the decency to show up to the service of person that you killed. I buried my son, and you, you didn't say a fucking word. - Mrs. Fisher- - Think you can kill me? Hmm? Well, make your move. I'm afraid to die. I'm actually terrified.
