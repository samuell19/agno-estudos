I'm home, everyone. You must be tired. I'm glad to see you. Where's father? He went out with the madam. Chihiro! Mariko! Welcome home. Congratulations! Tomorrow at last, huh? Thank you. I've got something to prepare, so... See you later. Please come in. Welcome home, Miss. Hello, I'm here. Celebration on the eve of the wedding ceremony We're going to adopt Masahiko, 2nd son of Yuzo Sugiyama... ...as a husband for my daughter. Before the ceremony tomorrow, I want you to recognize it... ...and have asked your presence here tonight. I'm thinking of entrusting the two with management... ...of Amamiya's property and enterprises. Chihiro, you have no objection, do you? Of course not. As I told you before I went to Tokyo. All of you have no objection, I suppose. I hope they may receive further favors from you. Please encourage them, everyone. You must be tired. You're exceptionally pretty tonight. Thank you, Shige. Tomorrow at last. Masahiko. The strength of your house and ours will be superlative when combined. You had better run for election to the prefectural assembly. Cut out the business talk tonight, dear. You may talk anytime from tomorrow. That's true. How about a drink, Chihiro? I've had enough. You're setting up business on your own account, aren't you? I've made many acquaintances among manufacturers, so... You'll succeed in any business. I wish I could do the same. Your doll making is nothing more than a hobby. It isn't that easy to make money in Tokyo. I think I can follow herways. Come here, everyone! A terrible thing happened to Mariko. Hurry! What's up? Mariko was offered in sacrifice to the Devil-mask! Young lady! Young lady! Mariko! Where are you, Mariko? Mariko Amamiya was murdered cruelly. Her dead body was found fastened to a shutter in the river. A strange devil-mask was found near the dead body. Thank you. The Spirit of Mariko Amamiya The Amamiyas are an old family of this village. Lumbering is their main business. All the forests around here are theirs. They have firm grip on this village, right? But some have ill feeling toward them. Gozo was the late Amamiya's secretary. He's an upstart, see? Utae is his second wife, right? Yes, she is. The late Amamiya's daughter was killed by a phantom killer. Utae took her place. The 4th daughter Reiko alone is hers. Reiko is a half sister to the other three, huh? I feel sorry foryou. Mariko was a very gentle girl. I can't convince myself that she is dead. With the wedding ceremony just ahead she departed this life. How could a man kill her in that way. I can't hate him enough. Mr. Amamiya. The devil-mask which was fastened to her dead body... ...is a stolen article. Yes, it was one of the masks kept in our library. Please. Thank you. Mr. Tarao! What brings you here? Mr. Utagawa. You're a busy man as always. Who is this gentleman? He's a private eye from Tokyo. Tarao Bannai. A friend of mine. He likes to stand in my way. How come he is here? The dead Mariko was working in my office before. So I was invited to herwedding reception. Is that so? What a pity. The wedding proved fatal. But why? Amamiya's intention was to provide a husband for Mariko... ...and have him take charge of his property in time. Captain! A painter who has his face burned was there just before the crime. Painter? A man who look like him is staying in an inn. What's his name? Hinata according to the lodger list. Last name only? Yes. This was left in the inn. What's this? The water mill in an evening glow... I see. I think the crime to be an inside job. The insider made Hinata strangle Mariko and... Mr. Utagawa. But how come the offender took all the trouble of... ...fastening the mask to Mariko after painting it red? The culprit... ...used the mask and the threatening letter to cheat our eyes. A camouflage, see? Everything will be cleared up, if the painter is arrested. It's a matter of time. We don't need your help, Bannai. I'm sorry. Shall we go? See you later. Sugaike Sanatorium The Shinshu Girls High School Hey, Ikegami. Yes? Tell this man if you know something about the late Ozaki. I'm Bannai Tarao. Did Ozaki come to this village some time? I didn't see him since he quit school. Did he have any friends outside the school? He kept mum about his own affairs. Is that so? Mr. Ebata! Reiko is having a fit again. Reiko! Thank you, Doctor. How is she? Her usual sickness. Get some water. She's Mr. Amamiya's youngest daughter. She has a fit often in the summer. It's her chronic disease. Poor thing. Reiko! I'm sorry for giving you all this trouble. Reiko is all right now. Chihiro? She's all right. Thanks very much. Reiko, are you all right. Calm yourself. Chihiro. You come here often, don't you? My mother died here. She liked this place very much. I used to play here when I was a child. A painter named Hinata painted a picture of this water mill. Take a look. It's a beautiful picture. Don't you think? I can't think of him as a criminal. The setting sun is very red. Even then how could he draw the water mill as red as this? I can't fathom it. Chihiro, I'll take care of Reiko. You go to bed. Yes, mother. Good night. The doll is dying. The doll is dying. The doll... The doll is dying. Don't worry, Reiko. Calm yourself. Did I surprise you? Terribly, Kaoru. It's a tea serving doll. It is? How crafty it was made! Miss Akemi lent it to me. A puppet exhibition is going to be held soon. You made the clothes for it, huh? Yes. It's becoming, isn't it? I have to make another by tomorrow. It's an all-night job. Let's be off. Kaoru, you forgot this. Thank you. Good night. It'll be bad foryour health if you don't sleep. Thank you, Shige. If Hinata isn't caught early... ...we can't have a good sleep, can we? By the way, Miss. A long time ago... ...a painter named Yoichiro Hinata was living in this village. Yoichiro Hinata? It's a strange name so I remember. When was it? It was in 1952. He was living near the mill for about a half year. The water mill? A painter named Hinata, a suspect... ...drew a picture of this mill also. Really? And then...? Ask Kume, the former mill keeper. She knows better. Where's she now? She left this village unawares. Where could she be? What's up, Shige? What's up? Aw, Kaoru! Master! Shige! Kaoru! Kaoru! A doll is hanging down. Captain. Where's the victim? Right here. Captain. We won't tolerate the antics. The victim was strangled and was hung in midair. The incident seems to have occurred between 3:30 and 4 am. 3:30 to 4? Right after the incident... ...Shige saw Hinata who was peeping through the window. Hinata, the painter? Who discovered the victim first? Shige did. Where's she? She lost her legs and is lying m bed. I see. Hinata stole into the house led by some insider. He killed the victim and hung her from the ceiling. I see. Seize it. Let me ask you all. Does anyone recognize this? Whose necklace is this? It's young lady Chihiro's. Chihiro? The eldest daughter? Yes, sir. I see. How come it's here? Shut up. I'm thinking. Don't disturb me. Hello, Mr. Utagawa! The second tragedy occurred at last. Well, that's no wonder. A natural outcome. What do you mean? Kaoru was the successor after Mariko's death. Who would be the next successor? The 4th daughter Reiko will be counted out since she is sick. There's only one person who can be the successor. The eldest daughter Chihiro...? She has no intention I becoming the householder. Ostensively, yes. Who knows what's in her innermost heart? She and Hinata banded together to get the property. We'll dig up their relation and arrest them. Seize all evidence. Take pictures. Don't let the family members and employees get away. Place the area off limits. They'll be questioned later. Go around the entrance. Did you find anything? Look at this. Blood is incrusted on the tip of her nails. Blood? Kaoru must have resisted quite a bit. Thank you. Don't lose heart so much, Chihiro. Thank you. Please let me. Will you? Thanks. Are you all right? I'm all right. I'm sorry. See you later, then. Thank you. Are you all right? Mr. Ebata! Principal, this is Yamaguchi, a newjanitor. I'm glad to have you. Miss Akemi. You're doing fine. Goodbye, sir. Miss Akemi! Miss Akemi! Brother! The corpse has gone. I burned up the things. All right. Somebody is spying on us these days. We must be careful. Quite. Excuse me. This is my card. I want to make a picture of this village. Let me stay here. Not now. I'm disappointed. My friend, Hinata to told me this is a good village. You draw pictures? Let me see them. This is well done. You're flattering me. Let me see yours? Will you take a look at mine? Here's one. Here's another. Are they any good? They aren't much. You may have them if you like. Hey, mister! Don't bother. I'll be seeing you. Didn't you see a fellowwho looks like an artist? Yeah, he's gone that way. Not there! Over there. Damn fools! The Kigajo Police Station Don't just shut your mouth and remain silent. Come on. Inspector. That's too much. How could I kill Mariko? Mizutani sawyour meeting with Hinata. He was watching me from the garden then. That's very strange. You met Hinata near the Jizo in secret. A farm woman saw it. It's about time you owned up to it. You made Hinata kill your two sisters, didn't you? Come now. Mr. Utagawa. What should I kill my sisters for? The succession. You're eager to succeed to the property at heart. You're in debt tor starting business in Tokyo. That's too much. Excuse me. Tarao! What brings you here? You're going to far by treating her as a suspect. Are you throwing cold water on my work again? To disappoint you... Mr. Utagawa. Hinata whom you called into question... ...was already killed. What did you say? It's been 10 days or more since he was killed. So the man who burned his face and appeared alter that was a fake. The real culprit tried to make believe Hinata was guilty. Hinata is a poorvictim. Now, you don't mind if I take her over, do you? Let's go, Chihiro. Where's the corpse? Search around here. Everywhere! Search the other side! That silly old man might have made a fool of me. I found it, Captain. One and one is two. Two and two is four... Aha, this is the picture drawn by Yoichiro Hinata. It's serine and has a nice touch. Mr. Tarao. There must be some connection between the two Hinatas. The mill is the connection. Yoichiro Hinata was living near the mill. Another Hinata was there to draw a picture. Mr. Tarao. In my memories... ...a boy is playing with me near this mill. There always was my sweet mother near us. And there was a man in her shadow. Chihiro. Chihiro. Is it yours? My mother gave it to me May I borrow it just for a couple of hours? I have a great appreciation for pictures. This picture is done well. An artist named Yoichiro Hinata lived in this village. Did you see him? I've heard of such a man. But I was a priestling about that time, so... You don't know his whereabouts, do you? I'm afraid not. I've known the Amamiyas foryears. But I've seen this for the first time. There's no way but to locate Kume, the old mill keeper... She was deeply religious. What can she be doing now? How is your father lately? He doesn't stay in bed all day, but... ...he has a fit at times. You have my sympathy. Utae has no one but you to turn to for help. Doctor, is he all right? Let ham lie quietly without letting him get nervous. Give this medicine to him three times a day. Thank you, doctor. I have to talk to the doctor personally. Leave your seat. Hinata in question was killed. So I heard. Was it your plot? What makes you think that? You're one of the few who knows my secret. One among you killed my daughters and is now threatening me. Isn't that right? Kume is living near the Tsuzumi Bridge along the Mitsume River. It's a fine day isn't it, young lady? But it's very hot. Where are we going? The Mitsume River Lodge. That's an old cottage. The village is declining. There's a steep and narrow pass before we get there. Kume, I want to know something about my late mother. You knewYoichiro Hinata, the artist. What was there between the man and my mother? Please tell me. This is not a place foryou. Please go home, young lady. Tell me anything about my mother if you know. Young lady, please don't ask me. What secret is there? Can't you tell me? Well...er... Kume, pull yourself together! Huh? Why is it? If you want to know the truth... ...ask Mr. T...Tarao. T...Tarao. Tarao... A serious thing happened, Mr. Tarao. It's terrible. Miss Akemi was found killed at school. She was? Come in. Thank you. By the way, how is Mr. Amamiya doing? Thank you, but... This weather must be trying to him. Please. They fit exactly. What're you doing? Let go of me! Someone come and help me! Young lady... The Amamiyas are finished. So you are...? Pipe down! Why you! I'm here to fetch something I left 20 years ago. Chihiro! Kume! Chihiro! Chihiro. Mr. Tarao! Are you all right? Didn't you get hurt? I... I'm scared. It's all right now. Let's get out of here. Chihiro. Are you still anxious to know who killed your mother? Yes, I am. Please tell me. Chihiro. Man is a silly creature. I saw many a man spoiled by a desire. A man who was fated to be one... ...killed your mother. In 1949, your mother Kiyo... ...fell in love with Yoichiro Hinata who stopped at this town. That was the origin of the incident. Hinata had a child. So the late Amamiya separated them against theirwill... ...and tried to make Kiyo marry Gozo, but Kiyo was... ...already with child by Hinata then. Chihiro. It's you who was on the way. Yoichiro Hinata was my father...? Who killed my mother then? Kiyo used to meet Yoichiro in secret... ...even after she married Gozo. The boy who remains with you as a playmate... ...was Yoichiro's son, Toru oryour stepbrother. However... Gozo who learned of Kiyo's calling on Yoichiro secretly... ...fastened Kiyo's dead body to the mill... ...to make it look like a crime committed by a passerby. Then he made Hakoda and the other two call Yoichiro... ...to his detached room. Run away quick, Toru! Hurry! The evening sun is very red I see it nowwhy the mill was painted so red. Get me some water! Here you are. Gozo! You're on your last legs. What? The medicine Hakoda made up will get to your nerves. Everything went well just as we planned. You lorded over the Amamiyas for the last 20 years. But it's about time you retired. Ebata! Why you! Someone, come. There's no employee around. The Ebatas who were rich for generations... ...were done out of theirwhole property by the late Amamiya. My father committed suicide... ...and his family was scattered. I wish ill of the Amamiyas since then... ...and have thought of controlling the house someday. My prayers were answered at last. The Noh mask fastened to Mariko and Kaoru was... ...Iike a treasure to the Ebatas. From today, I'll manage Amamiya's whole property. This house, the forests orwhatever. Utae, give him the last pill and let him take his ease. Utae, you too...? Papa! Reiko, get away. No! Papa will be killed. What're you doing? Papa will be killed! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Reiko! Ah, Kiyo! Kiyo! Chihiro...? Father. What brings you here? Father. I want to hear the truth from your lips. The truth? What'd you mean by that? That you killed my mother and my fatherYoichiro Hinata. I don't know. I didn't kill them. You're a coward, father. Do you still pretend to be ignorant? That'll be enough, Chihiro. You two unlucky Amamiyas have come to an end. Genkai. The new Amamiyas will begin today. I want you to die, you two. Mother. Stop it, Utae! Who made you what you are today! You're dying hard. Everyone goes to the otherworld alone. Gozo. Damn you! Gozo! Aw, father! Chihiro. We won't keep you alive since you learned all this. I want you to die with him. Hey, what're you doing? I'm here to make arrangements for your funeral. I was sent here by the King of Hell. What're you going to do? Get him! Who the hell are you? I'm a janitor. I'm a poor artist. I'm a vagrant woodman. I'm a one-eyed driver. I'm Kume, the mill keeper. I'm Bannai Tarao, a private eye. But... ...in reality... ...a man of truth and justice... Daizo Fujimura. I'll make the incident clear. Ebata who curses the Amamiyas started the whole thing. You planned to take revenge on the Amamiyas. You are intimate with Utae. When you heard that Mariko would take a husband... ...you made your men kill her under the guidance of Utae... and left her dead body alone in the pond. Then you fastened a red mask to the corpse... ...to make believe Toru Hinata was the criminal. Don't move! That was the first crime. The second crime... You made Ozaki kill Toru at the mill... ...and buried the corpse under the floor of Akemi's lodge. But you felt danger because Ozaki had big mouth. You killed him also. Don't move! That was the third crime. Then you made Mizunuma and Akemi kill Kaoru... ...and cleverly let the police cast suspicion on Chihiro. You killed Akemi when she began trembling for the guilt. Furthermore, you killed even Kume who held Amamiya's secret. You committed another crime. You killed Gozo at last. You must have thought that you gained... ...Amamiya's whole property. There's, however, a man... ...who is trying to fish in troubled waters. He's a vice priest in a clerical rode. It's you, Genkai! Don't move! Stay where you are. The entrance is guarded. Stop your futile resistance. You're all under arrest on charges of murder... ...and aiding and abetting the murder. Take them? Chihiro, too. Hold her firm. Everything is over with this. The incident has reached a conclusion. Now I can snub that old private eye, Bannai. Thanks for coming, Mr. Fujimura. Mr. Fujimura! Mr. Fujimura! Don't be in a hurry to kill a man. There is a long way to go. Stand firm on the ground. Mr. Tarao! Mr. Tarao! Mr. Tarao! Chihiro. I'm going ahead of you to Tokyo. THE END
