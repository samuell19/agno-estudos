He used to be like her best friend a couple years ago. What happened? I mean I've heard bits and pieces of the story. Well, our senior year, he was just dating this chick that just wasn't good for him and everybody knew that Zay was gonna make it with football. So, when Portia tried to tell him, he thought she couldn't be happy for him. Calm down. Stop! I mean like he knew the chick wasn't right. And so, then like Portia just professed her love and that's when things kind of went left. But I mean how can Zay not like Portia? I think he just wants to keep his options open. So, it's complicated. Exactly. Hey. Oh, shit! Holy shit! Hey, I know you're new to the groove but I like you Casey. I like you too, Jackie. Get off me. Damn! Look at his face. How did that happen? Shut up. Damn! Alright. That feels great. Bruh, what about you? You need to close your mouth. I don't like the smell. Crazy. It's bullshit. Oh! I think eventually they're going to hook up.
