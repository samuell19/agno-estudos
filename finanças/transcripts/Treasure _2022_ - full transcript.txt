REPUBLIC OF TÜRKİYE DIRECTORATE GENERAL OF STATE SUPPLY OFFICE - Hey, Mom. - Yeah? - Thanks for the dinner. - Enjoy it, son. Have a home-cooked meal so your stomach can rejoice. Listen. Don't be late tomorrow. - Why? - We've talked about this, son. Nimet and her daughter, Gülnur, are going to visit us. Damn it, mom. Again? I'm 45 years old, damn it. Shame on you. There's no shame in it. Just meet her. What's so wrong with that? Weren't you supposed to go back, Mom? I didn't come all the way from our hometown for nothing. I just want to see you start a family before I die, son. I'm sure you will someday, Mom, but this isn't the right way of doing it. There was this old guy, Mustafa, who was our neighbor way back when. - You remember him? - I don't. Mustafa, huh? He never married. He withered away all by himself. And when he died, the neighbors only found him after two whole days. Because of the smell! Come on, Mom. Why would you bring that up? We're eating. People said Mustafa was a bit "different," if you catch my drift. What are you trying to say? I swear... For God's sake! For God's sake... Hey! Don't you be late tomorrow. What a bonehead. You're such a fine lady. Oh wow. She went to Marmaris. "Add friend," huh? Let's think... Just add her, Mesut. I don't care what happens. NURDAN HAS ACCEPTED YOUR REQUEST Yay! It's fine. It's okay. It's okay, Mom. It's just lightning. Thank you so much, God. NURDAN CANOĞUZ 1 NEW MESSAGE Good morning, Mr. Mesut. Are you into theater? I have two tickets to a very nice play on Saturday. You go, Mesut! Damn it, Mom. Hello? Hey, Musa. - Oh wow! Hey, older bro! What's up? - Listen, Musa. - What happened? - Listen, Musa. - Yeah? - Mom passed away. Are you serious? I am indeed. I found her dead in her bed this morning. They say it could be a heart attack. Is this a joke? Oh, my dear mother... My condolences, Musa. It's a big loss for all of us. Indeed. Don't waste time, then. Be here soon. - Be where? - Here. For the funeral, man. No way, man. You should bring her here. It's her hometown. Hello? Well... I thought we'd just have the funeral here. Are you insane, man? Our family cemetery is here. We can't bury her there all by herself. You think so? Of course. Just have them bring her here. You can take a bus yourself. I'll pick you up. Fine. All right, then. Let's do that. TREASURE YERGUZ TOURISM ÇIKMAZOLA BUS TERMINAL Get in, kid. You too, honey. Stop enabling them. Sit down. - Oh wow. - Hey, Musa. What's up? Welcome, big bro. Thanks... Thanks, Musa. Thank you. - Oh you. - My condolences, Musa. My condolences. Yeah, man. To you as well. I almost didn't recognize you. You've changed. I mean... Who knows? It's not a big deal. I don't know. - No luggage? - No. I'm... - I'm going back soon. - I see. Well, come on, then. Come on. Stop playing around, kid! Come on. Here you go, man. - Ahmet, come on! - Yeah? SCHOOL BUS - Who are these kids, Musa? - What? Who are they? The kids. Oh. Sorry, man. Your bus arrived just as I was dropping them off. I'll be quick. It won't take long. Bro, your... Your hair looks different. Different how? What do you mean? It's just hair. I don't know, man. Last time I saw you-- - For God's sake. - It's different. I remember it being a lot thinner. It's treatable nowadays, Musa. There's a solution, you know. - Do I have to answer to you? - Of course not. When is she getting here? They said they'll hit the road after the paperwork's done and be here by tomorrow morning. Hey, Semih! Sit down, kid. Bro... How did it happen, man? Tell me. I told you over the phone, Musa. We talked, remember? She went to bed last night, and then she died. In her sleep? Oh, my poor mother. I told her not to go. She wouldn't listen. What are you talking about, Musa? Am I not her son too? Come on, bro. That's not what I meant. She was old, and it was a long way. Let's just have the... Kid, sit down! Let's just have the funeral. But your nephews have grown. You should spend time with them. Right? - I need to go back, Musa. - No way, man. Just stay for a while. - You can't go back right away. - I'm busy, man. I have a lot on my plate, Musa. All right, bro. Come on. This is our bed. "Our" bed? We're bunking together? Shit. - What? - Are we bunking together? Yeah, man. Just like old times. We'll reminisce. That's ridiculous, Musa. Come on. Niğde and I... We've been having issues. That's why I've been sleeping here. Well, one of us can take the couch in the living room. No! That won't work. Niğde would kill us. No way. Well, I guess you can stay at Mom's place. No, man. She just passed away. Let's not do that. You said it'd be one night anyway. Isn't there a motel around here? I don't want to be a burden. A motel? No. I haven't seen you in ages. - Come on. Take a seat. - Don't rush me. - Sit. - Musa. Hang on. I need to make a call. I'll be right back, okay? Sorry about the mess. I'll tidy it up later. I'll be right back. Oh, come on. Look at this mess. God damn it. It's so dusty. Even the flies are dead. Even they couldn't survive in here. It's mine. - Let it go. Come on. - Knock it off. We have a funeral. Don't provoke him, Gürdal. Hey! What the hell? - So we're having just pasta and water? - We are. I haven't seen my brother in ages. This is no dinner. It's a dinner worthy of a thief. Does he know you're a thief? Come on now. He has a job. - The van-- - What are you saying? I said what I said, Musa. That's not your van. It's haram. This is not the time, Niğde. We have a guest. My brother. Why are you doing this? NURDAN CANOĞUZ 1 NEW MESSAGE I hope you die in that van. Stop pissing me off! Stop it already! Who cares if it's yours or mine? Did you ask me before you sold all my gold? Did you? What is it if not theft? Just fuck off, Niğde. My mother died today. You really have no shame. - My condolences, Mr. Mesut. - It was ours! - I heard you lost your mom. - It was mine! The van is mine too! - Thank you. - Scumbag. - I swear, Niğde... - Thanks for your kind words. Coming across a considerate person nowadays... - I swear we'll have another funeral. - What? You going to kill me? Do it, then. End it all. God damn you to hell! - You're something else. - God damn you! Enough! ...is like finding an oasis in a barren desert. - Piss off! - Thieving bastard. - What kind of husband are you? - You couldn't let me mourn in peace! Thanks for the food, sister. It's not the cig. I have water stuck in my throat. I'm sorry man. On your first night... I swear women start nagging the second you run out of money. You're lucky you're a bachelor. Don't take it for granted. Being single, I mean. It's fate. I still have a few tricks up my sleeve, though. Yeah? So there is someone? Is there? I have some business to take care of tonight, but... What business? Now? I need to leave. Just for a few hours. It's the night of the funeral. I know. I just need to drop someone off with the van. You could come too. I don't want Niğde nagging you. It's late, Musa. I already took the bus ride. I'm... You go to bed, then. I'll be back soon. I guess I'll go to bed, then. Don't be late, though. The funeral's tomorrow. Let's bury our mom properly. - You're right. - Let's do it. All right. I'll be right back. Good night, then. - Sleep well. - Thanks, Musa. - Don't be late. - All right. You go ahead. SCHOOL BUS What's up, bro? What? Oh, it's nothing. I figured I'd get some fresh air. You're coming? Couldn't sleep? Huh? Never mind. Just drive. ÇIKMAZOLA MUNICIPALITY Come on already. Finally. Here he is. Hey, Salih. Where have you been, man? We thought you weren't going to show up. That'd make you happy, wouldn't it? No, man. It's just-- - Hey! - Yeah? I hope this is not another small job. I've had enough. Small job? What are you talking about? We're making bank this time. I can feel it. Yeah, right. What's the treasure, man? Is it valuable? What's it worth? He kept saying it was very valuable. He said, "It'll get you an apartment in downtown," Salih. - Hey. Is that Musa? - Yeah. He's here. Let's go, Saffet. Come on, then. I don't think this opens. There you go. Yeah? - Welcome, guys. - Thanks. - Thanks, Salih. - What's up, Musa? Don't you remember my brother? It's Mesut. He's here for the funeral. Oh! It's Mesut? Of course I remember Mesut. I do, but we're not going to the funeral right now. We're after some treasure. Just so we're clear. You're so rude. We just wanted to be together the day our mother died. That's right. Treasures aren't my thing anyway. Didn't you use to be bald? No. It's treatable nowadays. There's a solution, you know. There's this shampoo. You just rub your hands together, put it on your head, and wait for two minutes. It'll make your hair grow. But the pH needs to be high. We've wasted enough time, guys. Get in. Let's not be late. Off we go, then. Come on, Musa. Treasure hunting on the day of the funeral? Don't be like that. We've made plans and arrangements. The time was set. You can't just start digging, you know. You know this stuff isn't easy. How would I know? How would I? Why would I know? Look at you. Our mother's dead, man. We'll be back in a couple of hours. You're serious. - Are you insane, man? - I said the plan was set. Do you have any idea how much trouble I'll be in if I quit now? I could be murdered, for God's sake. - I swear. - What the hell, Musa? Hang on. Where the fuck is it? Found it. Hello? Yeah? We're on our way, sir. Yes, we are. Sure. Who? You know, our usual squad. Of course, sir. No detours. We're on our way right now. I mean, we'll be done in four hours if luck is on our side. Yeah. Three, tops. We'll be waiting for your call before delivery, sir. Yeah. QURAN Treasure in the middle of nowhere? Of course. It's been abandoned for so long. Pour me some water. There's a protection spell on it. A foreign spell. Allah willing, we're going to break the spell. Allah willing, you'll succeed. Don't touch that. Want some? Sunflower seeds. - It gives me acne, but sure. - You'll be fine. What's your deal, Mesut? - Nothing. - I'm just saying. You can't just jump in at the last second and get a cut from it. That's ridiculous. He's here for our mom's funeral. You can't. Hey, guys! - Come here! Hurry up! - What's going on? - What is it? - Come on. Thank God. - Get over here. - Allah protect us from evil. - What did you find? - I see it. - Easy. - What is it? - I swear we found it. - Here we go. - Come on. - Come on. Push that aside. We found it. Oh God! It's a corpse! It's fine, man. He's already dead. Pull him out. The treasure is cursed. It has a dead guy with it. - Oh, come on. - It's fine. - Just go on. - It's not a Muslim treasure. Their curses don't work on Muslims. - There's no curse! Come on. - I'll banish anything evil through prayer. Leave it to me. Get the fuck out. - Take it. - We can't wait for you forever. - In Allah's name-- - Just take it, man! - Come on already. - Wait. I'm praying. - Pull it! - Calm down, man. What happened? You do it. - What? - Someone else do it. - What happened? - Just-- Cut it out. The guy's dead. It's fine, man. - Are you scared, you moron? - I'm not touching him. - You scared? - Help out. - Get out. - I'm not helping out. - Fuck you. - İlyas, just take it. - Just do it. - Don't fucking touch me. You were supposed to be the brawn. - Just take it. - That's why you're here. We found it, man. Stop fighting. - It's been hours. - Watch your mouth. Watch your mouth or else, man. I'm not just brawn. Enough already. Or else what? For God's sake... - Stop arguing, guys. - What are you doing, Musa? - Stop it, Saffet. - As if you can do anything. I swear you won't see a dime. Fuck off. - Easy! - You'll give me my cut. - You thug! - Hey! What did you do, man? Allah forgive us. Allah forgive us. Allah forgive us. Allah forgive us. İlyas? Is this a prank, İlyas? Just get up, man. - Is he dead? - Yeah. Oh no. Musa. We're murderers, Musa. We are. - Damn it, Saffet. - Now what? Well... The police. Let's call the police. No. No police. Not the police. No way. Musa, just get the treasure. He's already dead. Just take it. Go ahead. Come on. What are you saying, Salih? He's dead. This is not a movie, Salih. What do you want us to do? Fine. Fucking call the cops. We'll get at least ten years for illegal excavation. - We'll lose the treasure too. - He's right. Did you hear that, Musa? - He said ten years. - Shut up, bro. He was our friend, Salih. Oh, come on, for God's sake. As if İlyas would've cared if you died. - He wasn't your friend. - Right. Come on, Musa. - If you say so. - I do say so. We've been digging for a while now. I mean, we've been planning this for a long time. I mean, İlyas is already-- - Dead. We can't help it. - Yeah. Right? Right. - I'll just take it. - Go ahead. - Allah help us. - We found it, after all. - Okay. - Let's go. Musa... What are you doing, Musa? You... What have you become, Musa Hakkı? Cut it out, bro. See if there's anything else. Dig around a bit more. Yeah. Dig deeper. Don't touch it. Don't. Stop it, bro! Here. Here. Open it up. - Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. - Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. Here we go. I swear we found it. Here it is. Allah protect us. It's wood. Wood? Maybe there's-- There's nothing else, man. Dig around and check, Musa. How can you even touch that? - There's a skull. - Anything else? I mean, there are a few bones. - Come on, Musa. - Stop it, man! Don't touch the corpse! Let's not waste time, then. Who cares? It's what the client wanted. Let's go. Come on, Musa. - Saffet, come on. - Come on, Saffet. - But... What about İlyas? - We'll bury him. - What? We can't. - We sure can. - What? - We'll bury him here. Musa, they'll blame us. - No, bro. Come on. - He's dead! The guy's dead. - They'll blame us! - Calm down. - Take your brother, Musa. - Hush. - Get him out of here. - They'll blame us. - Saffet, Gani. You two bury him. - Let's do it. - We're murderers. - Cut it out! We're murderers, Musa. Hey, Musa! That phone... It won't do much without the treasure, you know. I know. And you know it's worth nothing without the phone. Yeah, I know. Hey. Listen up! We didn't hunt for treasure tonight, and nobody saw İlyas. We need to bring the two together once things calm down. - You know that, right? - I do, Salih. - You're still talking about the treasure? - We'll talk. Come on. This is no way for a Muslim to go. May... May Allah rest his soul! ÇIKMAZOLA COMMUNITY CLINIC SCHOOL BUS What if... What if they find me in Ankara? - Who, bro? - Who do you think? - Who, man? - The police, Musa. Oh, come on. They're not after us. But they will be. How, man? We buried him in the middle of nowhere. Who's going to even go there? You guys did. You did. Others can do it too. But we knew what was there. What if they find out too? Just stop, for God's sake. It's not like we killed İlyas. We didn't do anything. - You think so? - Of course I do. Just relax. No one's going to find him there. But they will. His client will notice he's gone. - Enough already! - They'll ask questions! His client only cares about the treasure. - They'll ask. - Why would they? We just need to deliver the treasure. That's how we'll save our skin. FUNERAL TRANSPORT VEHICLE - I hope so. - Oh, Mother... I hope you're right. Oh, Mother... My poor mother. Oh, brother... - May they rest in peace. - Thank you. - Sorry for your loss. - Thank you. Your father? - Father? - What? The deceased is our mother. İsmet Çataltepe. Yes. Your father. - "Çataltepe?" - Father? Our last name's Hakkı. Her name is İsmet Hakkı. Should be our mother. What's going on? What is it, man? I see. What? If... - If there's an issue, we can ID her. - What happened? - He's right. - No need. Let's go out for now. We can check. No need. Let's go to my office. I'll order you some tea. - Tea? What? - Please. There's some paperwork. We'll handle it. Please. - Just tell us what's going on. - Let's just go to my office. It's always the paperwork. I mean... I don't know what to say. This has never happened before. But, like... Come on, sir. How could they confuse her with a man? You're right. May Allah forgive them. You know, since her name is İsmet-- What's wrong with her name? Don't you guys check before moving them? You're right. - Look, sir. I'm... - Such a shame. I really need to be back in Ankara before the weekend. So please let's just end this today. I implore you. Please. First, we need to prove the deceased is not your relative. What? - But-- - What are you talking about? We lost our mother. You brought us a guy. - What's there to prove? - Musa. Listen, sir. I mean, come on, for God's sake. There's a man in that coffin. The deceased is a man. He... And the person we lost is a woman. Our mother, I mean. Please find our mother and bring her here so we can give her a proper funeral. Of course. You're absolutely right. How about this? Let me just hand you the forms you need to fill. - Forms? But why? - Please fill them. Here's a pen. Give it here. If you'll excuse me, I'll make a quick call about the mishap. - Just fix it, man. - Sure. - Please, sir. - Of course. Excuse me. - Where do we start? - Just hand it over, Musa. Come on, man. What a guy. Musa. Hey. What does he want? He called you over. You can come. It was the only room available. We have a few loose ends we didn't talk about yesterday. - İlyas didn't just vanish, you know. - Right. - See? - His family will ask about him. The police too. We'll tell them we don't know. That won't work. I'm sure someone knows he was with us. Damn it, Musa. I told you we had a funeral. - I told you not to go, Musa. - Stop, man. - What are we going to tell them, Gani? - That he got lost while hunting. "We got separated while we were hunting." "We thought he went back on his own, but it turns out, he didn't." - I see. - Let's say that. That's a solid plan. Let's use that. What do you think, bro? Are you insane, Musa? It was an accident. He fell during the argument. - We didn't do anything. - It's too late for that. They'll just think we killed him for the treasure. - He's right. They will. - Damn it, Musa. We became orphans yesterday, and you're trying to make me a murderer too. Look. It already happened. We all need to say the same thing about the hunt. You talk to Salih. I'll talk to Saffet. He'll listen to me. We'll all be on the same page. I'm going to the police. - What? - This won't work. - Come on. - This is ridiculous. - Come on. - Hunting? That's just ridiculous. - What will we tell them? - Just... We'll just fill the form and sign. Unfortunately, the situation is more complicated than expected. - What happened? - What do you mean? We don't exactly know where the deceased is. - What? - But don't worry. Our entire department is working hard so we can fix this as soon as possible. For God's sake... SALİH'S BIKE REPAIR SHOP Why's there no reception? - She's doing it on purpose. Niğde! - It's okay, Musa. I'm sorry, bro. - It's fine. - Niğde! Come here! Give me your plate, son. Why are you barking? This is not okay. How many times have I told you? My brother's here. It's perfectly fine. Spaghetti is the best. Right, kids? Come on, bro. We keep eating pasta. I'm sick of it. Since the van is mine, I'm selling it. I'm selling it online. Selling it online? What do you even know about the Internet? Right. You're the expert. I see you on your phone in the yard. - What phone? - You keep pointing it at the trees. What? Can't a guy use his phone? By all means, use it. Use it day and night. I'm sure someone will listen to your lies. What the hell? Watch your mouth. Musa Hakkı? That's me. You need visit the station. İlyas Yıldırım was reported missing. İlyas Yıldırım? Yes, İlyas Yıldırım. The construction worker, right? I hope nothing bad happened. We know who he is, sir. We'll know what happened once we find him. But, Officer, what does that have to do with us? - He was last seen with you. - What do you mean? You must be mistaken. Oh, you don't mean... We went hunting with him the other day. Is that it? - So he's still hunting? - He didn't come back? He obviously didn't. Come on. God damn you. Who knows what you did this time. Get up, Gürdal. If you're looking for a thief, it's him. It's always him. The scumbag keeps stealing stuff. You thief. Come, son. - I'll go change, then. - Go ahead. Hurry. And you? Hey, you. - Me? - You. - Do you need Musa? - No, man. You. Yes, I'm me. How can I help you? - Were you on the hunt too? - Hunt? What hunt? - The hunt. - Don't you remember? I told you on the phone. That's what he's talking about. Oh, that. Right. Sorry. I couldn't think properly when you asked me so abruptly. Yes, they went on a hunt together. What are you to the suspect? - Which suspect? - Musa. Musa Hakkı. - Did you call me a suspect? - Yes. Come on, Officer. Don't jump to conclusions. He's my older brother. We just lost our mother. He's here for the funeral. We're mourning, you know. - My condolences. - God bless. Thank you. Really. Well, then. You should come too. Just in case. No need, sir. He doesn't know anyone here. Yeah. Like he said, I don't know anyone. I'm a stranger. Sir, don't push it. Come on. - If you say so. - I do say so. We should go, then. Which station are we going, Officer? Come on, man. I asked him. He told us. It's the central station. Come on. Please, God. ÇIKMAZOLA POLICE STATION Go ahead. Come in. - Good evening. - Good evening. Musa Hakkı? That's him. I'm Mesut Hakkı. Let's not get the names confused. I see. You? - My older brother. - Yes. That's me. - I'm Mesut. He's Musa. - I see. Take a seat. Listen, guys. Someone has been reported missing. The name's İlyas Yıldırım. His wife gave us your names. She said you're his friends. As Salih here put it, you guys were on a hunt. - Yes. - Well, I'm listening. We went hunting the other day-- What did you guys do to İlyas? Where's my husband, Musa? You went out late at night. He's still not back. You can't do this, ma'am. Leave. - Zehra-- - I have a bad feeling, sir. Zehra... Please, honey. - But his phone's on. - You're mistaken. - But it is. - Just no. - Please, Zehra. - Musa! - Please. That's just wrong. - Right. We were talking about İlyas. Her husband's missing, so she's... - She's upset, of course. He's missing. - It's tough, sir. Zehra's not usually like this, you know. Anyway. We went hunting together, sir. Everyone here except my brother. - He wasn't here yet. - Yeah. - We were hunting. - That's right. Right? Yes, Saffet. Remember? He was dealing with the funeral stuff. He wasn't here back then. He arrived later. My condolences. - Thank you. God bless. - Thanks. I live in Ankara, sir. I work at the State Supply Office there. I see. - Thank you. - Yes. Where were you hunting? Where were you guys exactly? Where were you? What was the place called? I knew it. It's near the dam, sir. - The dam. - Yeah. There's a forest near the dam. That's where we were. - Near the dam. - Yeah. But who-- I'm really sorry, sir, but I swear they're lying. Come on, İbo! I swear they were after some treasure. Who would hunt in the middle of the night? Who would? Did you guys kill him? Why are you being a bitch, ma'am? Stop lying, for God's sake. - Zehra! - They were treasure hunting. - They're lying. - Just get out. - For God's sake! - Go sit. - Stay alert, İbo. - Yes, sir. For God's sake... We were there hunting partridge, sir. But we got separated. This is the best time to go partridge hunting. İlyas is a very impulsive guy, you know. He's always running around. - Ever since he was a kid. - Yes. - I remember his childhood. - Yeah? He's one of a kind, really. We call him the Acrobat. She mentioned treasure. She said it was late. Treasure, sir? Please, for God's sake. Maybe İlyas has other friends who do that kind of stuff because, I mean, I don't remember any treasure. Forget the treasure, guys. Didn't you look for him at all? Doesn't he have a phone? We tried calling, of course, but since it's such a remote area, there was no reception. - We couldn't reach him. - Yeah? - Yes, sir. - There's no reception near the dam. Sir, his wife says his phone is still on. That can't be, sir. I mean-- Just take his number and talk to the operator. I'm sure we can pinpoint its location. Yes, sir. So? He was missing. Why didn't you call his wife? What if he fell and hurt himself? We always hunt there, sir. He knows the area. We figured he'd find his way back. - You always hunt there? - Yes. - Near the dam. - Yes. You barely remembered where it was. Well, you know, we're a bit nervous. We just couldn't answer immediately. You look tense. I... I... I just... It's just too hot in here, with my coat and all. I'm starving too. My body must be-- There's the funeral. - He came from Ankara. - So I feel a bit under the weather. - You weren't with them? - He wasn't. I mean, I just can't point a gun at a living being - and pull the trigger anyway. - Damn it! Well, let's put your statements on the record. - İbo, call the search and rescue squad. - Yes, sir. You guys all should be there at dawn. Show up and help with the search. Are we clear? Of course. You know the saying. If you don't look... - You can't find. Right? - Right. Off you go, then. - We're letting them go? - Yes, İbo. Come on. - Should I be there too? - Every one of you. I'll help out, then handle the funeral-- - Do what needs to be done. - I see. - Good night. - Good night. - You too, İbo. - Yes, sir. - Call the squad. - Yes, sir. 13 MISSED CALLS İlyas? Damn it! Fuck. Hello? He hung up. - İlyas! - İlyas! - İlyas! - İlyas! İlyas! - İlyas! - İlyas! Listen, Musa. - Yeah? - İlyas! I heard you guys were at the station. Yes, we were. Look. I'll take you down with me. - I'm telling you. - Hush. - I swear I'll take you down. - What are you talking about? We just told them how İlyas went missing. - He's telling the truth, Gani. - İlyas! Why are you getting all riled up? The client still hasn't called, though. That's the shady part, Musa. How would I know what the client's thinking? I thought the treasure was important to them. We had to hurry and all. You should try calling them. They call from a private number. We don't have it. You're still not back, Mr. Mesut. Are you okay? We're worried about you. İlyas! The police are in contact with the operator. They'll find the phone soon. And then what? İlyas! İlyas! İlyas! Sorry for your loss. Thank you, sir. I didn't really know İlyas, though. İlyas? Not him. I was talking about your mother. Oh, that... Yes, our mother... Sorry. Thank you so much, Officer. İlyas! İlyas! İlyas is just missing anyway. He's not dead, right? İlyas! Yes. I mean, I hope he's alive. I hope he is. We're all here trying to find him. I hope to God we'll be able to find him. İlyas! Sorry to interrupt, Officer. Bro, it's... Someone's calling from Ankara. It's about the funeral. - I see. - İlyas! - Go ahead. - Sorry, Officer. - Hello? - Weird! There is reception, after all. I guess this immediate area has reception. - Here? - Yeah. - Our mother's missing. - Right. That's why they're calling. Sorry. İlyas! İlyas! HÜSO'S TAVERN Let's get a glass for you too, bro. My stomach hurts, Musa. I don't want to drink. Now, where was I? You gathered us all here. Whatever it is, just tell us. Spit it out, man. We're basically drunk. I remember now. I say we take the treasure from Salih. Come on, Saffet. We talked about this. Be patient. We'll see what happens. I don't have time. I don't care. We'll go grab the treasure tonight. - Is that so? - I'll kill him too if I have to. Dude... Shut up! Someone's going to hear. - Didn't I kill İlyas? - Just shut up, for God's sake. - Shut up. - Didn't I put him in the ground? You didn't! Just shut up. I keep thinking about you, Mr. Mesut. Do you want to cancel Saturday? Why do you even think you deserve a cut? We'll do it tonight. - Just shut up! - You guys can stay out of it if you want. Gentlemen, please calm down. I'm really sorry. He's a bit drunk, you know. Let's go freshen you up. - Go take a leak. - Yeah. We'll help. - Take a leak. - Come on. Thank you so much. I'll be there. Don't worry. Can I get a club soda, please? - Let me go! - Idiot. What a moron. Why should he get a cut anyway? - Let it go. - Why? - Don't attract attention. - Me? - He's drunk, Musa. - A cut, he says. For God's sake... I'm so happy to hear that. We should totally go. You should blow off some steam. Dude, look. Isn't that Saffet? What's he doing? Get up. He's going to Salih's. Hurry. Come on, Gani. Let's go. Cancel the club soda, please. Oh, we'll... I'll handle the tab tomorrow, my man. All right? Kick the clutch harder, bro. I swear you're going to break it. Stop it, Musa. I literally just took the wheel. Come on, man. I'd have caught him by now. You're drunk, Musa. I don't want us to have an accident, for God's sake. Here. Isn't that his car? Look at him swerve. Fucking hell. Just step on it, bro. Catch him. All right, Musa. Calm down. What the hell? What the hell, Saffet? Where are you going? To Salih's! - What did he say? - No idea. What did you say? I'm getting the treasure. - Oh God! - What the hell, man? Hey! You're wrecking the van! Leave me alone! I swear he's going to kill us too. - Hey! - Careful! - Hey! - You're rude! - Stop! - You're so rude! Just keep it under control, bro. I'm holding the wheel, aren't I? - Allah save us. - Hey! Fucking swerve into him! - Hit him! - What the hell? - Just hit him, man! - Hey! - Hit the motherfucker! - You're wrecking the van! - What the hell, guys? - It's all fucked up! - Oh no. - God! What did you do, bro? You... You guys told me to hit him. You did. Musa... - Oh, Musa... - We didn't tell you to kill him, though. Let's go check. - Allah help us. - I'm sure he's fine. - Look at me. Hey! It's fine. - Bismillahirrahmanirrahim. - Stop crying! - Is he okay? We'll see. Maybe he is. Let's check. - Go. - Did I hit him? - Get out. - He hit me! I didn't hit him. Is he fine? Is he okay? Musa. - Damn. - The car... Allah help us. Go check. Musa. Is he all right? He's not dead, right? Right, Musa? Where is he? Oh no. Come here, guys! Allah protect us. Oh no. Allah save us. Tell me he's not dead. He's not, right? - Oh no. - Is he okay? He's not dead, right? Right, Musa? Tell me he's not dead. Oh, Musa... - Allah save us. - What are you doing? - Enough! - This is not the time to pray, man. - Enough! - They'll blame us. Stop yelling, bro. - I've had-- - Just stop yelling. Stop. It's okay. Just stop. Come on, man. Didn't you hear me? - Saffet! - There's no time. - Saffet! - Let's go. - Bro, come on. - You... You hit me, Saffet. - Let's go, guys. - I was going straight, Musa. It's okay. It wasn't your fault. Let's go before someone sees. - Let's go, guys. - Let me go. Saffet. You... You didn't even know the guy, man! Right? Come on. - Saffet! - Let's go. - I was going straight, Musa. - Come on. They'll blame us. - I was, Musa! - Let's go. I know. - Musa... - He hit us first. He drove into us. ÇIKMAZOLA COMMUNITY CLINIC The bakery here makes the best buns. I bought cheese and meat buns. What's the plan, Musa? We'll come here every morning and ask about our mother like two normal guys who lost their mother until she gets here. - Want some? - "Normal guys"? What are you doing? That's what we should've been doing anyway. Look at us! Murders, plans, treasures... What is this, man? I was just here... - Please stop. - ...for our mom's funeral. Calm down, for God's sake. I almost had a heart attack. Look at you. You just blow up. You get so mad all of a sudden. - We can't help it, man. - What? We killed two men! - "We can't help it." - Hush. It's all so easy for you! We can't help it, huh? Nothing we can do, right? Amazing. Oh, Mother... - Hey, Musa. - Yeah? I'm... I want to talk about last night. I... I got scared. Look, brother. How were you supposed to know? You saw him. He was crazy. He was swerving into us. You just hit him back to protect us. That's all there is. He should've known better. Don't beat yourself up, okay? Love you, man. Yeah. It's Gani. - What is it? - He wants to meet at the coffeehouse. Is it about last night? I don't know. Let's go see. I was just looking for you. We found your mother. I'm arranging the transfer right now. No wonder they got confused. The first names were the same. When will she be here? She's on her way from Iğdır. There will be some paperwork too. It'll probably take about two to three days. - Two to three days? - Yes. It's all settled. It's settled. This is bizarre. A new death every day. - Sir. - What is it, İbo? You remember the totaled car from last night, sir? Another vehicle hit it. There's white paint all over it. The lab-- For God's sake, İbo. This could be important evidence, sir. There are footprints too. What evidence, İbo? He had an accident and died. Of course the car is scratched up. Just don't waste time. Don't let his body stink. He's one of the hunters, sir. What if they actually found some treasure and are fighting over it? They told us they were hunting. But Zehra said they were treasure hunting. What treasure, for God's sake? Those guys are useless. They can't organize a treasure hunt. - Sir-- - Come on. I bet he's gaming. Go ahead. What's up, Gani? Why did you invite us here? Welcome, I guess. It wasn't me, actually. Salih wanted to meet. Why didn't he call? I smell some trickery, Musa. Are you taking us down one by one? What are you talking about? I'm asking you. Did you kill him so you'd get a bigger cut? I don't even have the treasure. How would killing him benefit me? I'm the one who's responsible. - What do you mean? - It was my fault. What are you talking about? He's just being crazy. We couldn't convince Saffet yesterday, so he's still bummed about it. You told the police your brother wasn't here, but I keep seeing him. I did tell them that. So what? He doesn't get a cut. He's here for our funeral, not İlyas' funeral. I'm a murderer. - What is he talking about? - Come on, bro. Listen. We were at the tavern. I know that part. - Gani told me all about it. - He did? Did he also tell you how Saffet wanted to kill you and steal the treasure, how he was acting like a big man? Fucking drunk loser. You should've let him come. He was pretty open about it. "I'll go kill Salih," he said. I don't care! Look. If the police realize you caused the accident, you can't drag me into it, Musa. Me neither. What? You were already with us, man. You'd totally go down. He had a bottle of raki before he took off, man. They'll think he did it on his own. No one will suspect a thing. I hope so. For your sake. - Did the client call? - No. I check it all night every night. You need to watch that phone 24/7, man. There's no time. The police will find it. Today's your last chance. If you can't reach them, I'll follow my own plan. But if that happens, you know very well what will happen to your cut. - You heard him. - What's wrong with you? What are you doing, man? We're in public. Why did you confess? What the hell? I was the driver. - Get it together, for God's sake. - Just be careful. I'm... I... Damn it, Musa. ID CARD MESUT HAKKI ID CARD SAFFET ÇEVİK Good evening. - Were you looking for someone? - I'm Zehra. İlyas' wife. I know that, but I asked if you were looking for someone. I'm looking for Musa. What's up? I just have a few questions about İlyas. They say he's still missing. Yeah. They do say that. So I heard. All right. Go ahead, then. Ask him whatever you want to ask. Come on. Thanks, then. Easy, woman. Be careful. Come in. Good evening. Zehra? What's up? That's right, Musa. What is up? You invite her here too now? What? Shut up and get her some tea. She's our guest. Get her the damn tea yourself. I'll pour you some. Welcome. No, thanks. No need. Don't mind her. She's been on a mood lately. - Sorry to bother you. - It's okay. - You have a guest too. - My brother. He came from Ankara for our mother's funeral. My condolences. Thank you so much. Listen, Zehra. Remember this, okay? We're here to look after you while İlyas is missing. Okay? Don't ever hesitate to ask if you need anything. You've been saying he went missing while hunting. Yeah. That's what happened. - I don't believe you. - I'll pour you some tea. Take a seat. No, thanks. - What don't you believe? - He wasn't hunting. - What was he doing, then? - Digging up some treasure. My husband tells me everything, you know. That was the initial idea, but we changed our minds. It's partridge season, you know. It had been a while since we hunted. So you guys were hunting partridge with shovels and pickaxes? - İlyas didn't even have his rifle. - I told you we changed our minds. - Stop lying, Musa. - I'm not lying, Zehra. Please. I'm begging you. All right? Just tell me the truth about what happened. What do you want? He just went missing. İlyas is not missing. You went treasure hunting together. There's no treasure! Didn't you hear me? I told you. We went partridge hunting. You know, the bird! Hey, Musa. So this is the woman you've been calling in the yard, huh? Right? God damn you to hell. Are you seeing this, Mesut? Your brother is a thief and a scoundrel. - I'm sure-- - What are you talking about? Weren't you yelling "Hello?" in the yard the other night? You thought I was asleep but I wasn't, Musa. I'm always awake. - When was that? - I'm sure you know. Just fuck off, Niğde. I swear I'm going to hurt you. I won't allow this, Musa. You can't invite your lover here and blow up at me. I swear I'll take the kids and leave. Leave, then. Just leave. Go. Go to hell! See? Musa. God damn you. How can I go to hell? I live in it. Just leave, Zehra. Leave before things go sour. You guys didn't harm him, right? That's ridiculous, Zehra. Why would we harm him? - Come on, Musa. - You come on, man! Shame on you, Zehra! He said you'd find treasure and we'd be well off. He didn't mention birds. You guys took the treasure and killed my husband, right? You're lucky you're a woman, Zehra. - Musa. - Come on, man! I told you we'd look after you, and what did I get in return? - Calm down. - Your husband died, but... See? She got me thinking that too! Your husband went missing, but so did my friend. - Calm down. Have a seat. - Come on, man! - No one's as hurt as I am, Musa. - Sit down. Didn't you go treasure hunting? - Didn't you? - Just go home, sister. Stop fighting, you two. - Come on. - So be it, Musa. Call us if you need anything. I have a terrible feeling about this. We're here for you if you ever need anything, ma'am. God bless you. Do you know what happened? I just got here for Mom's funeral, you know. I have no idea. Swear on it. I mean, I swear... Mom's missing. My husband's missing too. - I hope we find them both. - I hope. Something must've happened. He wouldn't leave me like this. Oh, İlyas. My poor husband. Damn. What are you guys up to? Are you fucking plotting or something? Hey, Gani. Listen. This reminded me of you. LOVE IS THE MOST VALUABLE "TREASURE" - Give it back. - It's mine now. Stop fooling around, boys. Come on. Get the door, Gürdal. - Stop messing with your little brother. - Get in, son. Come on. Come on. I'll take those. To hell with this. Let's go. UNKNOWN NUMBER Hello? Hello? - Hello. - Hello? - İlyas? - Yes, that's me. Hello? Fucking hell. CHARGING PIN CODE Shit. What's the code, İlyas? One, one, one, one. INCORRECT CODE Shit. Fuck. I have one last chance. - Hello. - Welcome. - Good evening. - Thanks, sir. I was trying to turn this on, but I think I entered the PIN wrong. It's asking for a PUK code. Here. I see. The SIM card is locked, man. - How can I unlock it? - You need the PUK code. One of these. You can't unlock it without the PUK code. I don't have the info anymore. Can't you do something about it? I can't, man. It won't work unless you use its PUK code. Is that so? - Thanks, then. - Sure thing. - Good night. - Good night. Musa! Hello? The number you have called cannot be reached at the moment... Just what I needed. Let's see. Hello? Hello? Who is this? Hey, Niğde. It's Mesut. Oh. Well? What is it? I just got home, but the door's locked. I can't get in. - When will you be home? - We won't be, Mesut. What do you mean? What about Musa? God damn him to hell. I hope he rots there with the Devil. - Why are you saying stuff like that? - Ask you brother. Niğde! I swear... For God's sake... What are these people? I swear you're such a jackass, Musa. You really are. Damn it. Morning! Hey! What's up, sir? It's so early. Is Musa here? Why are you sleeping out here? - I couldn't get in. - I see. - So he's not home? - That's right. - Where is he? - I'm not sure. His phone's off too. He hasn't called. I don't know. Where are his wife and kids? - She went to her father's. - Why? How would I know, Officer? Just tell me what you want. Nothing. It's just that İlyas is missing, probably dead. Saffet died in a suspicious accident, maybe murdered. And now, Musa's missing. Don't you think something's fishy? - What? - What? Musa owns a J9 van, right? I mean, he has a van, but I'm not sure about the model. Yeah. J9 is a van model. Have you seen the state it's currently in? No. Why? What happened? It was obviously in an accident. It has different paint on it. See, Officer... I don't know. Like I said, he's not here, and his phone's off. I'll make sure he calls you once he's back. You do that. Make sure you do that. If he doesn't come back soon, visit the station so we can file him missing. It's all we do nowadays anyway. Am I right? Let me know. All right? He's not home, huh? Damn it, Musa. You jackass. You're irresponsible. So irresponsible. Fuck you, Musa. Fuck you, man. Fuck you. Allah forgive us for our sins. Excuse me. Allah forgive us for our sins. Allah... - What's up, Mesut? - Listen, Gani. Musa's missing since yesterday morning. - What do you mean? - He's missing, man. The door is locked too. The police are asking about him. I wonder if Salih did something to him. I would know if he did. - Sorry for your loss. - Sorry for your loss. - When did you last see him? - Yesterday morning. Have you visited İlyas' wife? You know, Zehra? Why would I visit her? Salih saw her leaving your place the other night. That's right. She paid us a visit. - So? - So, Zehra and Musa. Got it? Come on, Gani. He's married, and she's a widow. - That's not what I'm talking about. - What, then? İlyas was Zehra's husband, right? And what did we do to him? I'm just saying maybe Musa's talking. That's all, man. Why would he confess? Listen, Mesut! You should stay well away from that woman. Go tell your brother exactly that. We won't let him take us down. Hello? Yeah. Seriously? And when will they fix the cell tower? What? Can't they do it sooner? The culprit will be long gone. All right, then. Thanks. Just hang up. Have a good day. Just hang up! Mrs. Zehra? Take a seat. We're sorry to drag you all the way here. I got curious when you asked me to come. Ma'am, I think you were right about Musa. What? One of the alleged treasure hunters who were there that night was Saffet. He died the other day. He might be murdered. Look. These are photos of Saffet's and Musa's vehicles. They match. - I don't get it. - What don't you get, ma'am? Musa killed Saffet too. Just like he killed İlyas. Then he ran. He's hiding somewhere. So now you guys think İlyas was murdered too? - It's not like that, but-- - İlyas... We need to consider every possibility. I'm sure something happened to him. He would've been back otherwise. Please don't cry, ma'am. That's not what I said. We just need to find Musa to crack the case. Damn it, Musa. Who knows what hole you're in? - What about Gani and Salih? - What? Gani and Salih, sir. What if those two killed Musa? Would they? Maybe. Maybe they had a fight over the treasure. - It's possible. - Right? I'm sure. They told us they were good friends, ma'am. Who would do this to their friend, ma'am? - I just can't wrap my head around it. - Me neither. But it happens. We're human, after all. I see all sorts of messed-up stuff on TV. This is going to get complicated. I'll pay those two a visit. Let's stay in touch, all right? - What? - I'll call you. Oh, okay. What should I do, then? Can I go? Sure. You can go. - I can go? - Of course. Thank you so much. I'll go, then. - I'll call you. - All right. Sir. Hey. Hey. Sir. - Calm down. Don't be scared. - Oh God. You fell and hit your head. You have some swelling. Don't be scared. I... Are you okay? I'm Mesut. Musa's brother. I remember. What's up? Did Musa... - I was looking for you in the yard. - Looking for me? - Yes. - Don't cover it. Come on. - I'll get ice-- - It's fine. It's just a bump. - I'll go get some gauze and ice. - Thank you. Well, why were you looking for me? Like I said, Musa... Musa's missing. I'm looking for him. I thought you might've seen him. Maybe you know where he is. - I'll put this on your head. - Thanks. - There. Hold it there. - Thanks. So have you seen Musa? No, I haven't. You visited us the other night. I thought maybe he visited you back. - You know, to talk. - No. I haven't seen him at all. Look. Listen, Zehra. If... - Aren't you going to answer that? - No. I'll check later. Let's just put this on so it won't... Maybe it's about İlyas. I bet it's just the neighbors. They keep asking about İlyas. Thanks. It's still ringing. What are you, Mesut? The police? You keep pestering me about Musa and the phone. İlyas is missing, you know. Don't you have any respect? I'm all alone waiting for my husband. Where's Musa? Do you know where İlyas is? Do you? All right. I'll take my leave. Sorry to bother you. Thank you. I'll just... It's okay. Have a nice day, then. Take the ice to keep the swelling down. - No, thanks. It's fine. - All right. Well, take care, then. Everyone's down on their luck nowadays, so be careful. - Thanks. - Watch your step. Mr. Mesut, please don't get me wrong, but can I have your number? Of course. It's 0534 276 83 38. Let's add you, Ms. Nurdan. Here we go. Allah help us. Hey! Let me go! Let me go! Help! Stop yelling, you fuck. - Let me go! - Get in. Hey! Let go! - Let me go! - Stop yelling! Get in. Get in, you dick! Salih? Gani? What's going on? - You tell me what's going on. - Look, Mesut. Tell us what you guys are up to. - Gani, I'm-- - We don't want trouble, man. I don't know what you're talking about. I really don't, man. Where's Musa, Mesut? Where is Musa? Musa... He's missing. I called Niğde. His wife. I even asked Gani. You can ask him about it. I swear no one knows. Musa's missing. I swear. What are you and Zehra up to? Zehra? What does she have to do with this? MS. NURDAN Get up. Stop crying. Come on. Come on! Stop crying like a toddler. Get up! Why were you at Zehra's? I was just looking for Musa, Salih. Listen. What if your brother's in cahoots with her? - I don't know. - What if he is? So he'll get the money, leave his wife and kids, and run away with his lover? I don't know. What if he wanted İlyas to die in the first place? - What if he did? - I don't know. Please. I won't tell anyone. Let me go. Stop crying! Let you go? Where are you going to go? Where's Musa? He won't talk. Yeah. Listen, Salih. What if he really doesn't know? You were the one who told me they were up to something. Now you think he doesn't know? Are you toying with me, Gani? No, of course not. I'd never. I just think he would've talked after all the beating he had. We'll step up our game, then. Hitting him obviously doesn't work. - What are you going to do? - Wait and see. Listen, Salih. - Salih. - Move! - You're not a murderer, man. - Shut up! Everyone's a murderer anyway. I'll just become one too. - Don't. - I don't know anything! Where's the phone? - Zehra! Zehra has it! - She does? I thought you didn't know. Should I just cut you up? - Where's Musa, damn it? - I was looking for him. I heard the phone ringing in her place. It was that song! "Kuzu Kuzu!" - He's missing. - I'll cut you. - Stop, man. - Don't move! Put your hands up. Move aside. Move! - Who are you? - The police. I'm so sorry, sir. Without your uniform-- Don't make any mistakes. I won't hesitate. - Please help me, Officer. - Shut up, you murderer! He killed Saffet, sir. That's ridiculous! That's not true! They tortured me! - They did! - Okay. - What about İlyas? - İlyas? - Isn't he missing, sir? - Stop playing games already! Which one of you killed him? I have no idea, sir. I don't know either, sir. We found İlyas. Everything's clear now. How do we know you're not lying, sir? How would I know he's dead, then? - What the hell are you doing? - Hey! Hey! What the hell did you do? - What did you do? - Stop. - What did you do? - Don't. - This is your fault, Salih. - What did you do? Stop! - Hello? - Hello? - Mr. Mesut? - Ms. Nurdan? You didn't answer my calls. I hope everything's okay. Oh, of course it is. I'm okay. I'm just fine. It felt uncomfortable leaving you alone, so I'm here, Mr. Mesut. What? Where? Here. I'm at the bus terminal. I can't visit a funeral home this late, of course. Really? I mean... - Maybe a hotel-- - No. Of course not. No way. I'll be there. Please wait. Just hang on. I'll come pick you up from the terminal. - Okay. - I'm coming. - Thank you, Mr. Mesut. - Wait there. I'm coming. She's crazy, man. Ms. Nurdan. Ms. Nurdan. Hey. Oh! Mr. Mesut? - What happened to you, Mr. Mesut? - Welcome. - Thanks. - Just... Welcome, Ms. Nurdan. Thank you. You have no idea. I can't even begin to tell you about it. You wouldn't believe me anyway. They tied your hands too. Let me. - I couldn't untie it. - What the... How was your trip? I just hopped on a bus and came here on a whim. You're crazy. - I'll just... - Let me wipe your face. - Here. - Oh, thanks. If you'll allow me. - Let's hope it doesn't hurt. - It's okay. - Did it hurt? - No. It didn't hurt at all. - Perfect. - Thank you. You shouldn't have... - Your bag. - No. You're hurt. Please. I can't have you carrying it. You already had a long ride. Please. Welcome. I'm really sorry. I feel a bit woozy. This is not how I imagined this. - After you. Welcome. - Let's go, then. I'm... Welcome again. Mesut? Mr. Mesut? Let's just go inside first. Go ahead. Come on. What the... I'll explain, Zehra. Just let us in. - All right. Go ahead, then. - Come on. Let me introduce you. This is Zehra. - This is Ms. Nurdan. - Nice to meet you. Sorry for your loss. Are you Mr. Mesut's relative? - Well-- - Just a family friend. - That's nice. - Right. Well, that's... Can I use your bathroom? I need to freshen up a bit. Was it that way, Zehra? - Second door to your right. - All right. - There, sister. - Thanks, honey. Zehra, come here for a second. What happened to you, Mesut? Zehra, Salih's coming after you. He knows you have the phone. - What phone? - Your husband's phone. I know you have it. This is serious. Why would I have his phone? How do you know about it anyway? Musa had it. I just know. I recognized the ringtone. Everyone wants that phone. What did you do to İlyas? Tell me. What did you do to him? I... Tell me. İlyas was... I... Musa took me with them to look for the treasure. I just kind of joined them. They dug this big pit. About six feet deep. İlyas started arguing with Saffet while they were-- Is that right? So you're telling her everything, Mesut? - Salih? - Yeah, that's right. Salih. You think I didn't know you two were up to something from the beginning? - The phone. I don't have time. - Please don't. The phone! I don't have time! Don't, Salih. Listen. Look what we've been through because of the treasure. Enough is enough. Don't you agree? - The treasure? - Zehra, give him the phone. - Give him the phone, Zehra. - No. - Come on, Zehra. - No! Tell me what you did to İlyas. Tell her! You started anyway. Tell her how we killed everyone one by one. Tell her. Come on! Listen, Zehra. İlyas-- - Tell her! - While they were digging... Oh no. Move. - What? - Keep talking. - Move! - Okay. Zehra, listen.
