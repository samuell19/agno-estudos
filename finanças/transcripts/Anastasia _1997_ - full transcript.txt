♪ [Waltz] ♪ ♪ [Ends] ♪ Your Highness... [Woman Narrating] There was a time, not very long ago, when we lived in an enchanted world of elegant palaces and grand parties. The year was 1916 and my son Nicholas was the Czar of Imperial Russia. ♪ [Dance] ♪ [Dancers Clap] [Dancers Clap Twice] Hello, darling. We were celebrating the 300th anniversary of our family's rule. Papa! And that night, no star burned brighter than that of our sweet Anastasia, my youngest granddaughter. She begged me not to return to Paris, so I had a very special gift made for her to make the separation easier for both of us. For me? Is it a jewellery box? Dimitri, you belong in the kitchen. [Grunting] Look. ♪ [Waltz] ♪ [Gasps] It plays our lullaby.

"Together in Paris." [Gasps] Really? Grandmamma. [Laughing] [Grandmother Narrating] But we would never be together in Paris, for a dark shadow [Murmuring, Gasping] had descended upon the house [Glass Shatters] of the Romanovs. His name was Rasputin. We thought he was a holy man, but he was a fraud, power mad and dangerous. How dare you return to the palace? But I am your confidant. Confidant? You are a traitor. Get out! You think you can banish the great Rasputin? By the unholy powers vested in me, I banish you with a curse. Mark my words. You and your family will die within the fortnight. [Guests Gasping, Murmuring] I will not rest until I see the end of the Romanov line for ever! [Guests Screaming] Consumed by his hatred for Nicholas and his family, Rasputin sold his soul for the power to destroy them. [Groans] Go. Fulfil your dark purpose and seal the fate of the Czar and his family once and for all. From that moment on, the spark of unhappiness in our country was fanned into a flame that would soon destroy our lives for ever. [Gunshots] Help! Help! Hurry, children. My music box. Anastasia! Come back! Come back! Anastasia... [Explosion] Please, hurry! Come this way! Out the servants' quarters. Hurry, Anastasia. Rasputin, she's getting away. My music box. Go! Go! [Man] Comrades, in here! Where are they, boy? [Groans] Grandmamma... Keep up with me, darling. [Grunting] [Screams] Rasputin! Let me go. Please! You'll never escape me, child. Never! [Laughing] Let me go! Bartok! Master! [Gurgling] [Train Whistle Blows] Anastasia, hurry. Hurry. Grandmamma! Here, take my hand. Hold onto my hand. Don't let go! Anastasia! Anastasia! So many lives were destroyed that night. What had always been was now gone for ever.

Vlad, do you see what I see? No. Yes! Yes! A dog. Are you Dimitri? Cute. Perhaps that all depends on who's looking for him. My name is Anya. I need travel papers. They say you're the man to see even though I can't tell you who said that. Hey and wha..., why are you circling me? What, were you a vulture in another life? I'm sorry, "Enya." It's...It's Anya. Anya. Anya. It's just that... Anya. It's just that you look an awful lot like... Never mind. Now, you said something about travel papers. Yes. I'd like to go to Paris. You'd like to go to Paris? Who is this here? Look! He likes me! Nice dog. Now, let me ask you something... Anya, was it? There's a last name that goes with that? Well, actually... This is gonna sound crazy. I don't know my last name. I was found wandering around when I was 8 years old. And before that? Before you were 8? Look, I know it's strange but I don't remember. I have very few memories of my past. That's perfect. Well, I do have one clue, however. And that is Paris. Paris? Right. So, can... So, can you two help me or not? Vlad, Vlad, tickets. Sure would like to. In fact, oddly enough, we're going to Paris ourselves. And I've got 3. Well, this one is. But I've got 3 tickets here. Unfortunately the third one is for her, Anastasia. We are going to reunite the Grand Duchess Anastasia with her grandmother. You do kind of resemble her. The same blue eyes. The Romanov eyes. Nicholas' smile. Alexandra's chin. Look. She even has the grandmother's hands. She's the same age, the same physical type. Are you trying to tell me that you think that I am Anastasia? All I'm trying to tell you is that I've seen thousands of girls all over the country. And not one of them looks as much like the Grand Duchess as you. I mean look at the portrait. I knew you were crazy from the beginning. But now I think you are both mad. Why? You don't remember what happened to you. No one knows what happened to her. You're looking for family in Paris. And her only family is in Paris. Have you ever thought about the possibility? That I could be royalty? I don't know. It's kind of hard to think of yourself as a duchess when you're sleeping on a damp floor. But sure! Yeah I guess every lonely girl would hope she's a princess. And somewhere one little girl is. After all, the name "Anastasia" means "she will rise again". Really wish we could help but the third ticket is for the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Good luck. Why didn't you tell her about our brilliant plan? All she wants to do is go to Paris. Why give away a third of the reward money? I'm telling you, we're walking away too soon. Not to worry. I got it all under control. All right, walk a little slower. Three, two, one... Dimitri! Right in the palm of our hand. Dimitri, wait! Did you call me? If I don't remember who I am, then who is to say I'm not a princess or a duchess or whatever she is, right? Go on. Yeah and if I'm not Anastasia, the Empress will certainly know right away. And it's just an honest mistake. Sounds plausible. But if you are the princess, then you'll finally know who you are and have your family back. You know. You know, he's right. Either way, it gets you to Paris. Right! [Groans] May I present Her Royal Highness, the Grand Duchess Anastasia. Pooka, we are going to Paris. No, the dog stays. What are you talking about? The dog goes. No, the dog does not go. I say he's going. I'm allergic to dogs. Anastasia? You have just one problem there, fella. Anastasia's dead. All the Romanovs are dead. They're dead. Dead, dead. Am I right, my friend? I mean how could that be Ana. [Screams, Whimpers] Come on. Am I supposed to believe that thing woke up after all these years just because some guy claims she's a Romanov? Okay, I get the message. Enough already with the glowing and the smoke people. [Signs] If that thing's come back to life, it must mean Anastasia's alive. Just leave the dog. I am not leaving the dog. And that's her. We've got a train to catch. Wow! [Groans] Mayday! Mayday! Hey! [Screaming] Yech! [Groans] [Screams] Hot. It's hot! [Groans] Whoa! [Thud] Oh, boy. I tell you what... Ow! Who dares intrude on my solitude? Get out! Get out! Bartok? Is that you? [Groans] Master? You're alive? Yes. In a manner of speaking. Whoa, that fell right out there, sir. Something's happened? Yeah. Whoopsie. I knew it. I could feel the dark forces stirring. I'm not surprised, because I saw her. Anastasia. Anastasia? Alive? Sir, your lips. They're... That Romanov brat! Yeah, ain't that the kick in the head? I guess a curse just ain't what it used to be, sir? That's why I was stuck here in limbo. My curse is unfulfilled. [Groans] [Moaning, Sobbong] Look at me. I am falling apart. [Sobs] I'm a wreck! Actually considering how long you've been dead, You look pretty good. Bah. Sir, you do. You do. Really? Sir, is this the face of a bat who would lie to you? Come on! For a minute there, you had your old spark back. If only I hadn't lost the gift from the dark forces... The key to my powers. What? You mean this reliquary? Where did you get that? I found it. Give it to me! All right. Don't get so grabby. My old friend. Together again. [Chuckling] Now my dark purpose will be fulfilled. And the last of the Romanovs will die!

I hate that in a woman. [Whistle Blows] [Clears Throat] Look, I think we got off on the wrong foot. Well, I think we did too. Okay. But I appreciate your apology. Apology? Who said anything about an apology? I was just saying that we... Please, don't talk any more, okay? It's only gonna upset me. Fine. I'll be quiet, if you will. All right, I'll be quiet. Fine. Fine. You think you gonna miss it? Miss what, your talking? No. Russia. Nope. But it was your home. It was a place I once lived. End of the story. Then you must plan on making Paris your true home? What is it with you and homes? For one thing, it's something that every normal person wants. For another thing, it is a thing for...you know. What? Just forget it. Fine. Thank goodness it's you. Just please, remove him from my sight. What have you done to her? Me? It's her. An unspoken attraction. Attraction? That skinny little brat? Have you lost your mind? I was only asking a simple question. Attraction. Ridiculous. Last month, the travelling papers were blue. But now they are red. Papers. Papers, please. It's what I hate about this government. Everything's in red. Red? I propose we move to the baggage car quickly before the guards come. I propose we get off this train. [Barks] [Intimidates] Hey. Sorry. I thought you were someone else. It's you. Well, that's okay then. Come on! We got to go. Where are we going? You broke my nose. Men are such babies. [Yapping] Yes. This will do nicely. She'll freeze in here. She can thaw in Paris. The baggage car? There wouldn't be anything wrong with our papers now, would there, maestro? Of course not, Your Grace. It's just that I... I hate to see you forced to mingle with all those commoners. [Barking] [Chittering] [All Groan] What was that? I don't know. But there goes the dining car. Get off of me. I'm trying. Dimitri. What? I think someone has flambeed our engine. Something's not right. Wait here. I'll check it out. [Groaning] Anybody here? [Yells] We're going way too fast! Nobody's driving this train. We're gonna have to jump. Did you say jump? After you. Fine. Then we'll uncouple the car. [Groans] Come on! I need a wrench, an axe, anything. Here. [Yapping] [Grunting] Come on! There's gotta be something in there better than this. That'll work. Go, go, go! What did they teach you in the orphanages? [Chittering] The brakes are out! Turn harder! Don't worry. We've got plenty of track. We'll just coast to a stop. Whoa! [All Gasp] You were saying? I got an idea, Vlad. Gimme a hand with this. Hand me the chain. Not you! Vlad's busy at the moment. [Screeching] No! No! [Sharp Crack] And to think that could have been you. If we live through this, remind me to thank you. Here goes nothing. Brace yourselves. [Chain Clanking] Whoa! Well, this is our stop. [All Yelling] [Screeching] I hate trains. Remind me never to get on the train again. [Babbling] Wow. Take it easy there. You know sir, really you should watch your blood pressure. My nephew, Izzie, just keeled over one day, mid-mango. Stress it's a killer, sir. And he's a fruit bat. No meat. No blood even. How could they let her escape? You're right. It's very upsetting, sir. I guess this reliquary's broken. You idiot! [Growling] All right now, sir. Take it easy there. Just remember what I said to you about stress. I sold my soul for this. My life, my very existence depends on it. And you almost destroyed it. I get it. I get it. "You break it, you bought it." See that you remember, you miserable rodent! Sure. Blame the bat. What the heck. We're easy targets. What are you muttering about? Anastasia, sir. Just wishing I could do the job for you, sir. I'd give her a "hah!" Then a "hi-yah!" And then a "whooah!" And I'd kick her, sir. I have something else in mind. Something more enticing. Something really cruel. [Screeching] [Anastasia Groans] Are we gonna walk to Paris? We'll take a boat in Germany. Then we're walking to Germany? No, Your Grace, we're taking a bus. A bus. [Vlad Humming] That's nice. Sophie, my dear! Vlady's on his way! Who's Sophie? Who's Sophie? She's a tender little morsel. Vlad. A cup of hot chocolate. After a long walk in the snow. Vlad, ix-nay on the "Ophie-say." She's a decadent pastry filled with whipped cream and laughter. Is this a person or a cream puff? She is the Empress' ravishing first cousin. But I thought ♪ [Scatting] ♪ we were going to see the Empress herself. Why are we going to see her cousin? Dimitri? Well, nobody gets near the Dowager Empress without convincing Sophie first. Oh, no. Not me. No. No, nobody ever told me I had to prove I was the Grand Duchess. Look, I... Show up, yes. Look nice, fine. But lie? You don't know it's a lie. What if it's true? Okay, so it's one more stop on the road to finding out who you are. I just thought this was something you had to see through to the end, no mather what. Look at me, Dimitri.

I must say I'm so sorry. I thought that one surely was real. Well, she was real. I mean, she was human, of course, but not our real. But we won't be fooled next time. No, I am going to think of really hard questions. [Meows] No. My heart can't take it any more. I will see no more girls claiming to be Anastasia. Where is Uncle Boris from?

Well, this is unexpected. But look at me. Where are my manners? Come in! Come in, everyone. I am palpitating with amazement and shock and surprise All three. May I present Her Imperial Highness, the Grand Duchess Anastasia Nikolayevna. Oh, my heavens! She certainly does look like Anastasia. But so did many of the others. Where were you born? At the Peterhoff Palace. Correct. And how does Anastasia like her tea? I don't like tea. Just hot water and lemon. Good. Finally, you'll most likely find this an impertinent question, but indulge me. How did you escape during the siege of the palace? There was a boy... A boy who worked in the palace. He opened a wall. I'm sorry. That's crazy. Walls opening. So, is she a Romanov? Well, she answered every question. You hear that, child? You did it! So, when do we go and see the Empress? I'm afraid you don't. Come again, my pet. The Empress simply won't allow it. Now, Sophie, my bright diamond, surely you can think of some way to arrange a brief interview with the Dowager? I refuse to budge until an answer occurs to you. Please. Do you like the Russian Ballet? I believe they're performing in Paris tonight. The Dowager Empress and I love the Russian Ballet. We never miss it. We... did it! We're going to see the Imperial Highness tonight. We're going to get the 10 million roubles. We're going to be... But. Vlad, Vlad. Vlad, she is the princess. Anya was extraordinary! I almost believed her. And Sophie... Sophie wants to take us shopping for the ballet. Shopping in Paris.

She's the real thing, Vlad. That means our Anya has found her family. We have found the heir to the Russian throne. And you... Will walk out of her life for ever. But... Princesses don't marry kitchen boys. I know, but... We're going to go through with this as if nothing has changed. You've got to tell her. Tell me what? How beautiful you look. Well, thank you.

And I just wanted to... Yes? Well. Thank you, I guess. Yes. Thank you for everything. Anya, I... Yes? I'm... I... Yes? I wanted to wish you good luck, I guess. Good luck. Well, here goes. Please inform Her Majesty, the Dowager Empress, that I have found her granddaughter, the Grand Duchess Anastasia. She's waiting to see her just outside the door. I'm very sorry, young man, but the Dowager Empress, she will see no one. Tell that impertinent young man that I have seen enough Grand Duchess Anastasias to last me a lifetime. You'd better go. Please, let me just... Now, if you'll excuse me, I wish to live out the remainder of my lonely life in peace. I'll see you to the door. Come, come now. Come to the door. Your Majesty, I intend you no harm. My name is Dimitri. I used to work at the palace. Well, that's one I haven't heard. I must say. Wait. Don't go. Please. If you'll just hear me... I know what you're after. I've seen it before. Men who train young women in the royal ways. But if Your Highness will just listen... Haven't you been listening? I've had enough. I don't care how much you have fashioned this girl to look like her, sound like her or act like her. In the end, it never is her. This time it is her. Dimitri, I've heard of you. You're that con man from Saint Petersburg who was holding auditions to find an Anastasia lookalike. But, Your Grace, we've come all the way from Russia just to see... And others have come from Timbuktu. No. That's not what you think. How much pain will you inflict on an old woman for money? Remove him at once. But she is Anastasia. I'm telling you. She's the Grand Duchess. If you'll only speak to her, you'll see. [Groans] [Door Slams] It was all a lie, wasn't it? No. No. You used me? I was just part of your con to get her money? No. No. Look, it may have started out that way, but everything's different now because you really are Anastasia. You are. Stop it! From the very beginning, you lied! And I not only believed you, I actually... Anya, please! When you spoke of the hidden door of the wall opening and the little boy. Listen to me. That was... No! I don't want to hear about anything that I said or remembered. You just leave me alone! Anya, please! You have to know the truth! Your Majesty. [Engine Starts] Ilya, slow down. I'm not llya. And I won't slow down. Not until you listen. You! How dare you? Stop this car immediately. Stop this car! [Tires Squealing] [Horn Honks] You have to talk to her. Just look at her, please. I won't be badgered by you a moment longer. Do you recognise this? [Gasps] Where did you get this? I know you've been hurt but it's just possible that she's been as lost and alone as you. You'll stop at nothing, will you? I'm probably about as stubborn as you are. [Knocking] Go away, Dimitri. [Gasps] I'm sorry. I thought you were. I know very well who you thought I was. Who exactly are you? I was hoping you could tell me. My dear, I'm old and I'm tired of being conned and tricked. I don't want to trick you. And I suppose the money doesn't interest you either? I just want to know who I am. Whether or not I belong to a family. Your family. You're a very good actress. The best yet, in fact... but... I've had enough. Peppermint? An oil for my hands. Yes. I spilled a bottle. The carpet was soaked and it forever smelled of peppermint. Like you. I used to lie there on that rug and how I missed you when you went away. When you came here to Paris. What is that? This? Well, I've always had it ever since before I can remember. May I? It was our secret. My Anastasia's and mine. The music box. To sing me to sleep when you were in Paris. ♪ Hear this song and remember ♪ ♪ Soon you'll be ♪ ♪ Home with me ♪ ♪ Once upon a December ♪ Oh, Anastasia! My Anastasia. [Kiss] [Thunderclap] Bartok, get me a comb. Find some cologne. I want to look my best. That might take some work, sir. Then snap to it. We're going to a party. A party in Paris? That's right. I could teach you the latest dance step. It starts with like a whoo and then you get really crazy with the hips, sir. It's fun. We'll let the Grand Duchess Anastasia have her moment. Who cares? And then we'll kill her. Right. And then we'll kill her? Sir, what happened to the party idea? That's where we'll kill her. Crush her at the height of her glory. And we're back with the crushing. Sir, I'm begging you. Please, forget the girl and get a life. Oh, I'll get a life, Bartok. Hers! [Thunderclap] [Laughing] I remember now how much I loved them. They would not want us to live in the past. not now that we have found each other. Look here! The drawing you gave me. Remember? Yes. Olga made me so mad. She said it looked like a pig riding a donkey. She was right. In your laughter, once again I hear my Nicky, your dear father. [Gasps] But you have the beauty of your mother, Alexandra, Empress of all Russia. [No Audioble Diologue] You sent for me, Your Grace? 10 million roubles as promised with my gratitude. I accept your gratitude, Your Highness. But I don't want the money. What do you want then? Unfortunately, nothing you can give. Young man, where did you get that music box? You were the boy, weren't you? The servant boy who got us out. You saved her life and mine, then you restored her to me. Yet you want no reward? Not any more. Why the change of mind? It was more a change of heart. I must go. Hello, Dimitri. Hello. Did you collect your reward? My business is complete. Young man, you will bow and address the Princess as "Your Highness". No, that's not necessary. Please... Your Highness. I'm glad you found what you were looking for. Yes, I'm glad you did too. Well, then. Good bye, Your Highness. Good bye. ♪ [Scatting] ♪ [Whines] [Growling] You look fabulous! Do you mind? No, of course not. You're a wonderful dog. Well, if you're ever in St Petersburg again, look me up. So long, Vlad. Ah, my boy... You're making a mistake. Trust me. This is the one thing I'm doing right. [Whining] So long, mutt. I can't stay. I don't belong here. [Whines] ♪ [Waltz] ♪ He's not there. I know he's not. He... Who's not there, Grandmamma? A remarkable young man who found a music box. He's probably too busy spending his reward money as fast as he can. Look at them dance. You were born into this world of glittering jewels and fine titles. But I wonder if this is what you really want. Of course it is. I found what I was looking for. I found out who I am. I found you. Yes, you did find me and you'll always have me. But is it enough? My darling, he didn't take the money. He didn't? Knowing that you are alive, seeing the woman you have become, brings me joy I never thought I could feel again. [Kiss] Whatever you choose, we will always have each other. Grandmamma, can't you tell me the... [Pooka Barking] Pooka? Pooka? [Barking Continues] Pooka. [Train Whistle Blows] Voila. Merci. You're next. [Gasps] Pooka? Here boy. [Gasps] [Whining] There you are. Anastasia. [Growls] Anastasia... [Screams] Anastasia. Your Imperial Highness. Look what 10 years has done to us. You, a beautiful young flower. And me... A rotting corpse. That face. Last seen at a party like this one. A curse. Followed by a tragic night on the ice. Remember? Rasputin! [Mimicking] Rasputin. Destroyed by your despicable family! But what goes around comes around. And around and around and around and around! Stop! Oh, no, stop it! You're on your own, sir. This can only end in tears. I'm not afraid of you. I can fix that! Care for a little swim under the ice? Say your prayers, Anastasia! No one can save you! Wanna bet? [Groans] Dimitri... If we live through this, remind me to thank you. Thank me later. How enchanting. Together again for the last time! [Yells] You'll get a kick out of this. No! [Roaring] Dimitri! [Yelling] Watch out! Do svidaniya, Your Highness. Yeah! [Laughing] Hold on! Finally, the last Romanov death. [Screams] [Snarling] No! Anya! [Screeching] [Yelling] Long live the Romanovs! Right. I couldn't have said it better myself. [Groans] [Groans] This is for Dimitri.
