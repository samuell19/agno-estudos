CINDY (VOICEOVER): Remember there, the way you looked at me? TONY (VOICEOVER): Well, it didn't bother you. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Come on, you fool! TONY (VOICEOVER): When we took that picture, you still couldn't believe that you were on the famous Rialto Bridge in Venice, hmm? CINDY (VOICEOVER): No, I couldn't. It was nice being in Venice, just like in a play. Oh, look at this one. We were so funny. TONY (VOICEOVER): Here, we were really tired after we'd walked through the narrow streets all day long. CINDY (VOICEOVER): You know what? You deserve a kiss for being such a good and kind guide. TONY (VOICEOVER): OK. Anyway, in Italy, [INAUDIBLE] Venice. In a couple of days, we'll go on a short trip to the Alps. CINDY (VOICEOVER): Wow. TONY (VOICEOVER): And you'll see things you've never seen before. See? You couldn't stay away from me for long. You knew you had to come back. Now you'll stay with me under my power forever and ever. [SCREAMING] [LAUGHTER] I bet you never thought you'd visit the Alps on your Italian holidays. They really very nice, but rather weird. Reminds me of Snow White's woods. Snow White's woods? [HUMMING SNOW WHITE MUSIC] [HISSING] Watch out. Watch out! What's going on? In there. There was something in there. What's in there? He attacked me. He tried to jump on me. Who? I really don't know, but he should still be in there. Please, do something. OK. Calm down. I'll go and have a look, hmm? OK. Did you hurt yourself? Listen, stay calm. Don't worry. Don't worry. It's all over, OK? Everything's fine. We'll take care of everything. Just stay calm. That's the main thing. You're all dirty. Look at your hair. Thank god you arrived. Just stay calm. Don't worry, OK? Oh. There was no one in there, but I don't know how to put it. I got a feeling as if something or someone was really there. It's strange, very strange. Just take me away from here. -OK, jump on. -Yeah. We'll bring you to the village. OK, let's go. Mhm. Well, did you want us to drive you somewhere? No. No thanks. I can go on my own. Are you sure you're fine? I'm sure. Hey, where are you doing? Wait a minute! Do you know her? Uh-uh. We met her down at the cemetery. She said she was attacked. Because I'd like to see her aggressor face to face. Do you know that girl? She lives here. It doesn't take you that long to make friends. Usually, it's not so easy for outsiders. Doesn't seem so to me. We've already met two people. Yeah, that's true. You chose a very strange place for your vacation, a nice one but weird. I want to show you something. Come along. You don't look like a local. In fact, I wasn't. I wasn't born here, but arrived here just like you. So it's a permanent vacation. Not really. I retired up here after an operation to remove a third tumor that left me talking like a robot with this little machine. From here, I could continue my job in solitude and away from pity. What kind of work is it? I am a writer, and I write supernatural stories. Whoa. You got the right place to get inspiration. Everything here is so creepy. Don't joke about it too much. These mountains are really cursed. Many hundreds of years ago, the Simbers, a mysterious people, lived here, isolated from the rest of world. They practiced strange, evil rites, conjuring up demonic forms, which danced with the priestesses. Like the Sabbath witches. Unluckily, everybody thinks it was only a legend so nobody hunts them anymore. But now they are back. They force their victims to participate in repugnant rites after luring them to abandoned old holes where they finally sacrifice them. Hey, right. Now you're going too far with your imagination. You slave of your absurd reality. Do you think you're really so far from horror? He's crazy. Look at the beauty of all this, the waterfall and the stream, while I tell you a story. You love your friend, don't you? One day, you might find yourselves taking a romantic walk along the beach. You'd like to be as tender and in love as ever. But suddenly a diabolic fate possesses you, driving you to commit some inconceivable horrendous act. And your friend, she seemed so good and sweet. She might rise again to take a disgusting revenge! [SCREAMING] And you probably think you are so safe in the Alps you know so well. [LAUGHTER] You won't be able to avoid the evil there. Ugh. See what a terrible end you have come to, boy? Hey, writer, I don't like your stories. I don't like your little talking machine, and I don't like you. Please, Tony. Let's leave. OK, let's go. You know, friend? Your stories are really sick. In reality, they don't exist. Think about it before being so certain. Where are the people in this village? Maybe they hide in their houses so there's only the crazy guy with his nasty stories. He must be crazy, going around to all the tourists who arrive. Oh, Tony, I don't like this place. We're supposed to have a fun trip, but just-- I feel so strange. Let's go back to Venice. We decided we were going to have a trip to the Alps, and we'll have it. Are you sure you put the camp stove in your bag? I'm sure. And some first aid things. We could slip, fall, and hurt ourselves. Of course. I've brought everything we need. You shouldn't worry. We're only going for a walk in the woods, and not off to war. Yeah, but I feel so strange. It was that guy that scared you with his mad mystery tale. But now we are on our own together. [MOTORCYCLE ENGINE] Uh-uh. Look. There he is again. Hey, what do you want? Have you come back to give us some more disgusting details from your story? What a horrible guy. Well, what do you want? You see, there are things that are not the way they seem to be. The trouts, for example, blissfully swimming in the stream, see this little hook, and they think that it's a delicious small fish. So the trouts go after it. But of course they end up trapped. Is this is a tale about fishing? That's not your sort of story. You're missing all the zombies. I didn't want to tell you a new story, only to say that things are different and more dangerous than they seem. What do you mean? Is fishing forbidden here maybe? No. But when you're a stranger to a place, you should be careful. Because you don't know the risks you might go through. I told you it was better for us to leave. Well, thanks for the good advice. Maybe we're going to town right now, hmm? Anyhow, if you decide to stay, I hope you-- you have fun fishing. That guy's got the power to put me in a bad mood! Don't think about it. We're going to town before it gets dark, OK? OK. Let's go. [SCREAMING] What happened? What happened? Remember, there's a full moon tonight. Will you cut it out? [WHISTLING SNOW WHITE MUSIC] [SCREAMING] Did you hurt yourself? No, no, no. I'm fine. But let's just get out of this damned forest! Let's go down to the valley and find a peaceful spot to camp. Uh-huh. Come on. Enough though we've had some trouble, it's really very nice to be here with you. So you've finally freed yourselves from that guy. Oh, it's you. Do you know that guy? Why did you run away when we met him in the village? Everybody knows him 'round here. He's completely crazy. You'd better stay away when he's around. He brings bad luck. You know, since we met him, the weirdest things have been happening to us. Cindy nearly got killed by a great tree that fell down in the woods. Anyway, what do you wanna do now? I dunno. We're gonna to camp somewhere. We've got everything we need. You better not stay around here. Who knows what might fall on you next time. Anyway, I know a house not too far from here where you can spend the night safely. Why don't you come with me? Maybe it's better to go, huh? Yeah, I think so too. OK. Who is it? What's there? What's going on? Nothing. Don't worry. Come on. Let's go. We're almost there. In that small wood is the house where we can rest. These ruins belong to the house where we're going to sleep. Inside there is an old cellar that goes right underground. People say that somewhere at the very end there is a freshwater spring. I don't know whether it's better for us by staying here. Maybe it's better if we leave. No, come on. Don't be stupid. There's nothing to be afraid of. So where do you want us to go? It'll be dark soon. Everything's OK. You can sleep in here. Come on. Hey, I'm going outside. I don't miss a sunset. Your girlfriend's very cute. Where'd you get to know her? Come on. Let's snort some of this and we'll have a nice time. Hey. Well, you first. And you now. [BUBBLING] Look at that, look at this moldy stuff like snow. I want a little again. Yeah, try. Sure. Shit! I'm gonna throw this crap away! What's that? Ah, this gray stuff got me in the face. Hey, look what's here. These scratchings look like some kind of ancient script. Uh-huh. I don't understand anything. I think that perhaps they were left by those mysterious people that crazy nut told us about. I don't think so. This is recent. There's some inside. Look. Wait for me here. Hey, what's the matter? I don't know. What's going on? What's this stuff? Something great. No, don't throw that there. Not near the spring in the cellar. Now that's enough. Shit. I don't feel well. Since the filthy stuff splashed me, I feel strange. [COUGHING] You've probably just got a bit of fever. That's enough. I've had enough of your bullshit! Can't you see he's really sick? It's all your fault. You're the one that put him on that dangerous stuff. You knew it was dangerous, didn't you? Or did you even do it on purpose? Who the hell are you? What's going on in this damn valley? Don't get hysterical. You're the one who drives me up the wall! OK. If I bother you so much, I can leave. Yeah! Ah, if I find someone who can help you, I'll send them here. Listen. The main thing is just get out of my sight! [COUGHING] [NON-ENGLISH SPEECH] [SCREAMING] Oh, Tony! My girl, what's happening to me? Stay calm, please. Please, don't worry. It was a nightmare. You've only got a bad fever. No, I'm scared. No, no. Something terrible is going on here. No. Listen. I'll go find some medicine. This way, you'll feel much better, OK? OK? Do something, please. Do something. Listen. Let's go back to the ruins. If there's really a spring there, we'll find some water. This way, you'll feel better, OK? You'll feel much better. -OK. -Don't worry. -OK? OK. Come on. Come on. Wait, wait, wait, wait. Don't worry, OK? Everything will be OK. Huh? Yeah. [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] Cindy, get out of the way! Cindy! By the wheel! Wait, wait! I got him. I got him! I got him. I got him! We must find a way to escape from here. Where do you wanna go? We don't know the woods and we'll get lost with those creatures without anyone to help us! We must find a way. There's nothing left to do. It's the end! We'll never make it. We'll die here. It's over. You understand? No! Listen. You just can't give up like this. You can't give up! We must find a way! You just can't give up! This is gonna be our last night! well, let's have fun! [SCREAM] Let's make love! You're possessed! You're possessed! You're possessed! Are you possessed or something? [SCREAM] [GROWLING] Come here. Come to me. I'm the only one who can satisfy your desire. You want me, don't you? You've been looking for me all your life, even if you didn't know it. Now I'm here with you. Kiss me. Yeah. Kiss me. This is what I've been waiting for. You drive me crazy. I want you. Take me. Have me. [GROWLING] Have me! I have the witch. It's enough. You're done with your horrible crimes. Daddy, Daddy, we can finally settle our scores. You've never loved your little daughter, Daddy. You always treated her like a witch. But you can't leave without her. [HISSING] [SCREAMING] It's not all over. It'll never end. Someday, all of this will be destroyed! Destroyed. What's all this? I need help. Somebody help me! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna stay here, not in this forest. Cindy? Where are you, Cindy? Cindy! Cindy. Cindy, where are you, Cindy? Cindy! Where are you, Cindy? Cindy. Please, help me! I don't wanna die. I don't wanna die in this fucking place, Cindy. Cindy. Cindy. Cindy! Cindy! [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] Tony! Tony! Cindy! Tony! Tony! Stay calm, OK? I'll go down to the cellar to find some fresh water. No, come back. I beg you. Don't leave me alone. I'm scared. OK. All right. Please, I'll be back in a second, OK? [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] At the very end, do all of this! [LAUGHTER] [GROWLING] [SCREAMING] Oh, you fucking creatures! Don't think you'll get me so easily! [SCREAMING] [LAUGHTER] [SCREAMING] [SCREAMING] [CHAINSAW REVVING] Ugh! Shit. There's no more gasoline! [HEART BEATING] [SOBBING] Thanks. Father, thank you. Thank you, God of Light. [HISSING] [MUSIC ELISABETTA DE PALO, "EVIL CLUTCH"]
