Yes. A natural death case. Might have died in the toilet. Dunno. I'm still drunk. If I lose a client again,|it's your fault. Lipstick? No, I didn't rub it off. I gotta go. Rest peacefully. MAY YOU REST IN PEACE We have various grades of hemp shrouds. If money is an issue, there's also Chinese made. - I want the best. - Pardon? I want her last dress to be the best you can offer. I understand you, but don't you think a regular dress will be enough for a cremation? - Have you been drinking? - Eh? Just give her your prettiest dress. Sir...Here. Could you put it on for me? Sorry? They won't do as I say. My hands either. You don't have to. I'm only doing this because you're handsome. Must get a lot of customers. Sorry? You're good at what you do. LEE Ji-soo, from Geochun,|right? How did you know? The undertaker's only child. I wonder if your father is well. Do you know me? Do you like your makeup? You have such beautiful skin. May you go to heaven. Here. I can't seem to move my arms. Could you...? You're so cheeky. You shouldn't do that. You'll be punished for using your illness for personal gains. You used to hate being the daughter of an undertaker. - What changed? - I know. Amazing, isn't it? I doubt you would have married, or made a boyfriend. You're so prejudiced. I did get married. It just didn't last long. Single again? - Did you leave him or did he? - I let him leave. He said I scare him because I clean corpses. But that's not enough to file a legal divorce. - What about compensation? - I didn't get any. Civil law article 839, clause 2, the division of property. One has the right to claim the property of the other. When a settlement has not been reached, the court shall decide the property division procedure. Shall I get it for you? Just, that's what the law says. But anyway, you'll go to heaven for that. Not me. It's the people I dress that go to heaven. What happened to you? Lou Gehrig's. It's a lost cause. Once you get it, you gradually lose control of your muscles. In 3 to 4 years you die. I have about 2 years. Really? You scared? Everyone dies eventually. People just don't die in order. - So don't be scared. - I'm not scared at all. Because I refuse|to die this way. You know... Ji-soo, the way we met today... Don't you think we're meant to be? It's not fate. It's a coincidence. Then what's your definition of fate? Well... someone you stay with till the end? But I don't believe that kind of stuff. Okay! I'll make you believe. Let's go out. What is this? Put it away. I clean corpses for a living. And it's meant for the dead. Ji-soo. Could you stay with me? CLOSER TO HEAVEN Why haven't you charged him yet? Are you dating this guy? No, I'm not. How dare you say that? I despise men. Yeah, right! Why do you feel bad about collecting funeral fees? We're hardly thieves. If you don't collect it today I'll cut it from your salary. As you please. Hey! Ji-soo! - New socks? - Yup! 100% cotton. Amazing, isn't it? Whenever it rains, dad still scratches this saying it itches. They all do. It's been so long. Is everyone being driven out of this town? Is that why you're studying law? 'Cause it's unfair? When I first saw you, I recognized you straight away, but you couldn't. Life's been hard on me. Have you thought about it? About what? Don't mention it again. We'll make an odd pair. No, not that. About going to China. - Do you think it'll really work? - I just don't wanna give up. I can't just let life do this to me. - It's a way to fight back. - That's so noble of you. Alright, if you're better when you return, I'll go out with you. Really? Lou Gehrig's disease. Dies from breathing difficulties after showing symptoms of pneumonia. They really do die...? How have you been? I missed you, just a bit. Jong-woo! Wow, you look great in that suit! Could you wear this everyday from now on? So you called me to a hospital for a date? What have you got on your lips? I'm almost recovered. Wanna see? For real? - I'm better right? - You look great! I can go faster. Whenever you're ready. Put more strength into your left foot. Good job. That's all for today. Want some water? Thought we might be having Italian. So disappointing. Jong-woo. I have a serious question|I want to ask. Don't you think my hands are scary and disgusting? - Everyone says they're unlucky. - Those pretty hands? They're the prettiest hands in the world. I'm flattered. Do you want to spend the night with me? - I don't want to go home tonight. - You can't. Why not? I'm not going to pounce on you. You can have the bed. I'll sleep on the floor. - I thought you wanted to go out. - It's not that. You gotta go home, your father will worry. You're such a coward. Alright, wait one sec. What are you doing? Dad? I'm spending the night at the hospital. Love you. Bye. Happy? Ji-soo! Why do you have|to be so adorable? - Are you drunk? - I'm not. Not drunk at all. Damn, this is so embarrassing. I needed the drinks before I could ask you. Won't you regret it? I just wanted to chat, hold hands and sleep, that's all. Okay. Let's go then. I fooled you. I was joking. Fooled you. I'm so stupid sometimes. - They have a room? - Yes. I'm embarrassed. My crutches... It's worse for me, but I went to ask anyway. Get out of the car, right now! This is so nice. - You like it? - Yes. Come over here. Feels like you're in the water. It's my first time on a water bed. Jong-woo, promise we're only gonna hold hands? Don't worry, I can't get it up. Really? That's quite hurtful. Jong-woo. I was thinking... We do kinda suit each other. But I'm only going to stay as long as I want. Only until then, I'll stay with you. Also, to be honest... I was married|not once but twice. Wasn't your dad angry?|I miss you already. - Did something good happen? - Dad, I think I found the one. Should I get married again? He told me that my hands were the prettiest he's seen. Try to drink less. BAEK Jong-woo, do you take this infamous bride LEE Ji-soo to be your wife in sickness and in health to love and to cherish with your heart and soul? I do. LEE Ji-soo, do you take this handsome groom, BAEK Jong-woo, to love him until death do us part? Why aren't you answering? Depends on|how good you are. Then I'll be good. - You promise? - Of course, answer quick. I do. Hello, sea! Jong-woo. Jong-woo. Aren't you cold? I don't want you to catch cold. Ji-soo. - Shouldn't you be feeling sorry? - Why should I? Well, you may have been married twice. But it's my first time. I couldn't invite any guests or go on a honeymoon. Honeymoon? It's nothing special. It's tiring and far too expensive. - If you wait a little, later I'll... - Later? Listen carefully, mister. The moments we have now will amount to what we have later. The sky's so beautiful. Let's live like there's no tomorrow. Like a moth? Yes. It's just a different take on life. Let's go. Wait. - Could I have this dance? - You sound so creepy. - Are you happy? - Yeah, I think so. Jong-woo, lets sing that song. You start. There's one question I want to ask my love What is it about me you love so much. I saved a man with my heart's warm embrace. Why are you laughing? Now it's my turn to ask. Was it love at first sight? How did you feel? I just thought that you were the one for me. My love, sent down from heaven. There's no reason why we fall in love. Only that you were there for me to find. HOW TO KEEP MY MUNCHKIN HEALTHY There's no response. Could you raise both your arms? Is that the best you can do? Try to raise it more. You can put down|your right arm. Try and keep your left arm|raised. Keep it up. You've lost a lot of muscle. My nose turns into a waterfall. My stomach is full of butterflies. Because she wears her bewitching fragrance. Take a look at me Gui-soon!|Take a look at me right now. Take a look at me Chun-ja. You think I'll be here next year? What? Just, would like to live till this time next year. Didn't I tell you I'll take care|of you? Repeat after me. Live! - Live! - Every second! - Every second! - That's a boy. Here we go. Catch me if you can. - Rock, paper, scissors. - Yes! - Rock, paper, scissors. - Yeah. Well done. How could you screw up at the final interview? Hey, I don't wanna talk about it. - You should get hair implants? - C'mon man. Ji-soo, do you know we call him hypocrite? No, why? When we were in university, we all went to a brothel. At the end, he swore he hadn't done anything. He claims he just talked. He's one hell of a liar. - Seriously, we just talked. - Yeah right! You came out last. Did it twice, didn't you? Yeah, and he hates it when we call him a hypocrite. C'mon, guys. Ji-soo, you believe me right? Yeah. You can't get it up. Can't believe you guys! Coming through. - Love philter, shut up. - Why is he called love philter? - Thank you for coming. - Good bye. Dad! Have you been waiting long? - Here, give this to Jong-woo. - You didn't have to do this. I was listening out here, Jong-woo sounds happy... I am relieved. You look happy. I know you'll be okay but people like us who live on the dead, also survive on food. Take care of yourself. You're not going to see him? - Next time...|- Dad... Registered the marriage? Not yet. I didn't have time. I will soon, though. Take things slow, alright? - Ji-soo. What's up? - Huh? - You zoned out again. - Really? Did I? Do you want water? Want me to scratch your back? No, let's sleep. Come here. Did you not quit studying? There's no such word as|quitting in my books. - You're so admirable. You're the best. - Do I get a prize? Blood-pressure check. He could burst. - Thank you. - Let him rest. Oh, my... I don't think he's tired at all. He's all hard. Good boy. Smart, isn't he? - But are you really a hypocrite? - No, I'm not. - Should we? Aren't you tired? - Do you have a condom? It's ok, I took the pill. Give me a daughter. Please, let me be pregnant with a daughter. How is he? Is he still knitting? Yes. He must have a natural gift, he's better than me. He's trying so hard. Frequently using his hands will delay its effects. We should live each day like it is a year. Hundred times happier than other people. Isn't that how it should be? The thing about Lou Gehrig's is that every day is different. Are you rich? - No. - Then are your parents rich? No. Then you should be discharged. You can come in once a month for a check-up. It's a long term fight. People die because they have no money, not their illness. Wow, you've done so much! Let me read you a book. - Commercial law? - Alright. Article 64. Prescription of commercial products. If transaction claims is not employed for 5 years, the contract is ter... - Terminated. - Right. However, if a short term provision is given in another Act those provisions must apply. Article 65. I'M FALLING IN LOVE WlTH YOU MORE EACH DAY. LOU GEHRIG'S PATlENTS HOLD ON TO HOPE OF A CURE. It hurts... Yes, we're always on stand by 24/7 to see to your needs. I want to take a break. I never took a day off for three years. Find someone else. I can't do this anymore. You have a reputation. Clients ask for only you. - Don't even dream of quitting. - Don't lie. I'm not lying. It's true. Take this for now, alright? There's a man who loves me so much, A man called Jong-woo, who doesn't know how to say I love you. He's close enough to touch with my outstretched arms. Jong-woo. What are you doing outside? Aren't you cold? You're frozen like a snowman, you silly. - Have you been waiting for me? - You've been drinking again? - A tiny little bit. - Give me a push. Is this for me? You're so sweet. - Are we going on a picnic? - It's not for you. Sorry. Careful! - Aren't you cold? - I'm boiling. - How are you feeling? - Never been better. - Aren't you tired? - Nope, not at all. - Then why are you panting? - Huh? You're struggling. You shouldn't drink as much. I'm not struggling. I'm mighty Ji-soo. Go, mighty Ji-soo. Watch out for the mines! I plan to grow old with you. Yes, gramps. - Look, it's snowing. - Wow... I'm so happy. Jong-woo, have a go. Mom, it's been a long time. Father, mother. It's your son. You shouldn't drink. Mr. & Mrs. BAEK. Next time, I'll make sure he gets here on his own feet. I promise. Come in, you're the one who called right? Come inside. It's okay.|Come in. - Ji-soo, let's just go. - Don't be like this. Just listen to me. Young man, one dose of this and you'll be cured in no time. Come on in. Why so suspicious? Here, stand up and make your way into the recovery room. She looks like hell raiser. Try to keep still. Don't be a big baby. You're blood type B, right? - No, he's not. - Huh? I guess blood type isn't that important. He's been getting worse for the past few days. Also, he keeps getting a fever. - What else did you say was wrong? - Problems with digestion... It's because your muscles have lumped together. The TCM physician also said the same thing last year. That's all quasi medicine. We're the real thing. Please help him, doctor. Is it true that he'll get cured miraculously after this? Blood type A? I suggest praying. Miracles don't happen to anyone. It takes both faith and the patient's will to live. Do you even have a license? Are you aware that this is illegal? Medical law, chapter 2 article 3, paragraph 25. Physicians without a license cannot practice medicine. The bad energy has to be channeled out. I'm so sorry, sorry, doctor. He's become more irritable these days. Why are you being like this? He says you could have a miracle. Ji-soo... Ji-soo... I'm so sorry. Stick. How is he? He'll be okay after the fevers gone down, right? Don't you realize how serious a fever can be to him? What did he do? - Drink? - No. What are all these bruises? - Did he get acupuncture? - No. It seemed harmless... How bad is he? I understand your predicament. But do|you know you could have killed him? What? We have to wait for the test results. But he'll be bedridden from now on. No... Ms LEE. Yes? Go freshen up. He needs to be checked in. I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry... He's a real looker. Look at his nose. Looks like he's got stamina, don't you agree? You sick fool. With skin like that, it can't be the complexion of a man. He's my rival from now on. - Hey, he's smiling. - He's awake! I think yours is better than mine. Do you get skin treatment? I'm embarrassed but it's just my natural glow. - What are you filming? - Today's my wife's birthday so I thought a birthday message from the ward would be nice. Look, she's lying over there. Sexy as ever. For 4 years. Say a few words. Happy birthday. Would you like to say something? I hope you wake up soon. I'll pray for you. Thanks, but we're Buddhists. Jin-hee. Like a shot to the head. I'm losing my mind. Sorry to disturb you. Say something. Congratulations. But I'm not sure if long life is something to congratulate. It is something to congratulate. Now moving on to Gummy Gran. Just hurry up and wake up. Stop filming already. Alright, that was fantastic. Could you film me? How do I look today? Don't you get tired? Stop asking me that. You look better without the daily eye job. To my lovely wife, Chun-ja! Happy birthday honey. Sweetheart, I'll wait for you forever so take your time and come back to me... He's at it again. I have so much I've prepared for you. What are they? Come back to me if you're curious. I love you. One, two, three, four. Who was it? Who the hell stole my Chun-ja's ginseng? Was it you? It was you, wasn't it? Why do you have to steal it? - C'mon man. - Did you? I can't eat ginseng. I was in the marines. Got it? Hey! Give it back! We believe that family members|and patients should fully understand the reality of Lou Gehrig's disease. In the fight against the illness, certain complications can become a direct threat to their life. The lessons we give will not cure the illness. Rather, it will delay its progression. Take both your hands and massage the edges of the hands. And do the same to the back of each hand. Press the edge of each hand. INTENSIVE CARE UNIT Fuck. Ji-soo. Ji-soo. What's wrong? Want some water? - Could you sit me up? - Okay. My arm... And my legs... That's better. Ji-soo. What would I do without you? All I can do is talk. Did you register our marriage? Not yet. I was busy... why? I thought you might have. Don't, it's better this way. Jong-woo, let's have a child. Hey! I thought we agreed not to talk about it. Alright, I'm sorry. Hey, that tickles. It feels that good? It's amazing, all your senses are alive. But, aren't you feeling it a little too much? I should, while I can. You want more? What are you doing? - It could be fun! - What if someone comes in? We could torch them like moths to a flame. Your account balance is $110. Hey, slow down. You could choke. I feel much better. Don't you think this will agitate the old folks? - Must we do this? - Yup, we must. And often. It's down to us to change their perception to improve the funeral culture. A happy send off. Doesn't it sound great? Tada! You see? It's not at all morbid. - It's very comfortable. - What is it made of? Paulownia tree. Try it yourself. Won't you have a lie in it? - For me? - Yes. Hey! Are you telling me to die? You're trying to kill us and sell us these coffins? How much profit d'you get from selling these? Are you mocking us? You'll be damned for this! Please, calm down. Let's talk it through. Please, calm down. Really? Sold ten already? You're so talented. - Are you okay there, alone? - Me? I'm good. Gummy gran's here with me. So don't worry about me. Alright. - Jong-woo, I love you. - I love you too. Were you bored? You look more handsome today. What's that? You have an itch? Alright. Where? Here? - If they're done, tell 'em to fuck off. - A bit more... You know my nickname right? Want me to spit on you? Don't be like that, Jin-hee. - What the... - Jin-hee! I'm sorry. Okay. We'll go. Take care of yourself. What's wrong with her? Could you just kill me? The doctor suggested stem cell surgery. She said you could get better after the operation. - So stop saying such things. - Hey, KIM Sun-joo! You really believe that? Forget it. Just kill me now. Excuse me. I know it's none of my business, but you shouldn't talk to your mother that way. I know she's family but you shouldn't talk about dying - like it's no big deal. - What the fuck! Stay out of it! What's it to you? Could you just shut your mouth? Hey, kid. You should learn to listen to your elders. And I know your rebelling 'cause you don't have the guts to die. Think about your mom, she's... Do you get high from pissing people off? Hey! Are you really that nice? Or are you pretending? I'm dying to kill myself. Why? I know you want to put yourself out of this misery. You're a coward. - Don't be such a hypocrite. - What? Hypocrite? - You little brat! Come over here. - If I could, you'd be dead already. - What? - You come here. For Christ's sake. You think I don't know people like you? Twisted and narcissistic, with a broken personality. A complete egotistical brat. Are you happy being a brat? Do you know what everyone calls you? Proximity restriction. You want to die, huh? Don't kid yourself. You want to live. You're just lashing out 'cause you can't get it your way. Like a shot to the head. - Hey! Stop singing. - I'm losing my mind. Can't you see I'm talking to you? - Try to endure it... - Won't you shut up? Suppress my heart... - You think you can fool me around? - Between my fingers... Mr. BAEK! Calm down. It seems like you're getting breathing difficulties. Try not to be excited. Breathe slowly. Be quite,|you might wake up Chun-ja. You asleep? What? Me? - Is there someone else other than you? - You really want a beating? I'm sorry... about earlier. - You listening? I said I'm sorry. - Are you blood type A? I'm not that sensitive. Asshole. Also, I'm only saying this once, I'm not a hypocrite. I hate being called that. Whatever. I used to be really popular. Do you know what triple Axel is? I fell in the middle of a jump and passed out. When I opened my eyes my mom couldn't stop crying. When my dad ran off with some crazy ho, all she did was cry. Even when I damaged my spine and heard I was paralyzed, whenever she sees me|she starts crying. I'm sick of it. Skating was everything to me. I thought I was suffocating. Enough to want to die. Do you know that feeling? Of being crushed. A little. - C'mon, we should go. - You go ahead. I'm fine. If it were you, would you let your daughter live with a dying man? Look, they're exactly like Jong-woo's legs. - Did you order the tofu? - You told me to order the soup. By the way, you! Who said he's dying? Who? Alright, I apologize. He's never going to die. He's not going to die. I'm going to keep him alive, you hear? Without me, he's like a corpse... Oops! A big scarecrow. That ain't love. It's your selfish greed and pity. Don't you know? Love, my ass. Aren't I right? Shut the hell up! What do you know about love? Love is... suffering together until there's nothing left. Jong-woo, are you asleep? My handsome baby's sleeping. I had something to say... Careful. Are you comfortable? He's 56kg with a height of 180cm. ALS causes the joint and internal muscles to atrophies. When it gets difficult to swallow you have to encourage him to eat. His condition seems to be deteriorating faster than usual. He gets to cry and upset more frequently. The pseudo-medulla section of his brain is damaged. He'll find it hard controlling his emotions. Are you cleaning a corpse? - What? - Am I dead? - What are you talking about? - If you don't want to, don't bother. What's wrong? Did you dress a body today? - Yes. - Did you wash your hands? Doesn't it bother you|to touch me with those hands? What? You could at least wear gloves. Forget it, I'll do it myself from now on. What's gotten into you? There's nothing you can't do. After 9 years being here, I can do anything. Do you think it's time to let her go? It's not about letting go|or holding on. What about you, not get tired? Does love matter? I do it thinking that he and l have one body and soul. You know, Jong-woo. You've been a bit odd lately. Always getting angry at Ji-soo. Jin-hee, have you ever collected bugs? When you catch a dragon fly, you pin it when it's alive. At first, it flutters for a while but eventually it dies. I didn't think much of it then. But I feel like that dragon fly. Could you give me a smile? You look well. Ji-soo must be treating you well. You think so? Don't I deserve a congrats? I wouldn't have time to see you once I start working so I came by. Are you still reading? Silly of me to ask. Take good care. - What's wrong? - Gramps! - What's wrong? - Something's wrong. Gramps. Breathe. - Keep breathing. - Nurse! - Nurse! - Gramps, breathe. - Don't give up. - Gramps. That's the first time watching someone die. But you must see it all the time. It scared the crap out of me. Don't overwork yourself studying, okay? Take care, buddy. SOHN Jae-hyuk, male, 62. Time of death 1:45 p.m. April 16th 2009. Here, we have different grades of hemp shrouds. We're having a cremation so give us anything suitable. The cheapest. Any male employee here? You don't seem trustworthy. I'M HURT... Take those out and just give us the hood and the shroud. I'M HURT. COME QUICKLY. Sorry. Jong-woo. What happened to your face? Did you fight with Wook-Jung? - Does it hurt a lot? - Don't touch it. - How did this happen? - Water. Throw this book in the trash. - Jong-woo, what's wrong? - Throw it out. My back's itchy. Put on some gloves. Forget it. You can leave. Jong-woo, I'm here. What's wrong? Are you hungry? Thirsty? Want to lie down? - Itchy back? - Take it back out. What? The book? Jong-woo, you shouldn't frown. You'll spoil your handsome face. - Let me read to you. - Page 1307. - Governing Law. - I'll read, you hold the book. Okay. - This good? - Closer. It's too close. Higher. Has he lost it? There. No, it's shaking. He must be. - Hold it properly, I can't see. - Okay. Higher. Turn the page. - Your arms aching? - No, I'm okay. Then why's the book shaking?|Water. Jong-woo. By any chance... if you're doing this to push me away, then don't. I'm not going to leave you. And I... want to say... I don't think I can live without you anymore. Turn the page. Let's clean up and|change your nappy. Don't! What's wrong? You have to change nappy a lot to prevent a bedsore. Nappy? Do you think I'm your baby? Don't! Just stop it! I know it's hard. But you gotta stay strong... I want you to leave. - And go where? - I don't need you anymore. And... I feel sick every time you touch me. You're unlucky. So go and live your own life. I feel suffocated around you. Please, just let me be! Why are you doing this? We love each other. - We can tackle through this. - Love? Aren't you sick of using|that as an excuse? To you it may feel like love but for me everyday is hell. Can't you see that I'm dying? I'll be good.|Please, don't be like this. Do me this favor. Please just leave... please. Bastard. Look at your beautiful skin. Almost done. Look how clean you are. Look at all that sweat. Almost done. Chun-ja! What's wrong? Can you hear me? Look at me. Oh my... She can see. What in the heavens... Doctor, nurse, she's awake! - Ms. LEE Chun-ja. - Gun-sook! Blink if you can hear me. Gun-sook! Where are you? - Gun-sook? - Yes? - Hurry, Chun-ja's awake. - What? - She's awake? - Hurry! Chun-ja! - Gun-sook! - I thought she was awake. - Her pupils aren't responding. - What? No, I saw it with my own eyes. She blinked. If she did then it would have been a miracle. But she's not responding. Gun-sook... Don't be too disappointed. Keep watching over her. Let's go. Why that moment? God, why did she have to wake up while I was jerking off. I should have resisted. Chun-ja. Don't. Don't... no stop it! Stop, stop, stop it! Jong-woo... I... You crazy? What's gotten into you? How could you be so selfish? I just want you to be happy. If you were really thinking of me, you wouldn't be like this. I can't do anything anymore. I can't touch you like I did. Study law? I can't even turn the pages. Or hold a pen to take the exam.|Nothing... I can't do anything alone|except blink. I have nothing left, miracles or dreams. I don't want to die but I'm already the living dead. Did you ever think of that? At least once, did you? Love, you say? Stop treating me like a corpse and let me be. Please... You have inflammation in your lungs. Stop being so stubborn and let's get you another injection. Are you really not going to talk to me? Jong-woo, what's gotten into you? Listen to me carefully. I'm pregnant. Lou Gehrig's disease isn't genetic. I'm going to keep the baby. Get rid of it. - I'm having it. - Absolutely not! I won't allow it. It's my baby. I'm going to have it, and raise it. You! You're the devil himself. Do you know that? You disgust me. How could you think of only yourself? Because I'm dying, my thoughts don't count? You're not going to die. I'll save you. If you have that child... I'll kill myself. What? I'll bite my tongue. You've gone insane. I don't think I want to be with you anymore. It makes me sick to death. Remember what I said|in the beginning? I'll only stay as long as I want to. I'm not leaving because you told me to. I'm leaving you because I want to. Think hard, about who's being more selfish. Live or die, that's entirely up to you. Don't you think my hands are scary and disgusting? Those pretty hands? They're the prettiest hands in the world. Do you think she could wake up while we here? Nobody knows. Haven't you heard about next door? He was awake after 4 years and first thing he says to his wife, I heard everything and I'm torn up. His head was normal but she treated him like a vegetable. So watch what you say. I'm not surprised. His family always fought over medical bills. They seemed wealthy enough to me. I heard that stem cell injection is working. It must work. I heard even Jin-hee's moving out of the ICU. Why? Are you envious? - Mind if we come in?|- Come on in. - Let's get out. It's that guy. - You think he heard us? Jong-woo,|you first, one two three. There's one question I want to ask my love. What is it about me you love so much. I saved a man|with my heart's warm embrace. Why are you laughing? Now it's my turn to ask. Did you fall when you first laid your eyes on me? What was it like? I just thought that you were the one for me. My love, sent down|from heaven. Hello, Ji-soo. It's Jong-woo. Were you asleep? Where are you? I'm all better so come pick me up. It's true. Can't you tell from my phone call? It's time for our honeymoon. Are you crying? Why are you crying? Silly. CAN YOU REALLY DlE BY BITING YOUR TONGUE? Take him. Slowly. Turn him over. Slowly. Now, move your arm a little. Move this way, a little bit. One, two, three. Is everything okay? 51.6kg. The motor neurons that move your muscles are not working. That's causing the weight loss. The body is meant to move but since it can't, it becomes useless and gradually weak. For nine years, Ms. JOO has nursed her husband. People call her 'gummy gran' because she has never left his side and is stuck to him like glue. She had a dream last night. - Isn't that your hospital? - He appeared in my dream. That's gummy gran. He asked me to meet him on May 5th at 5 o'clock. Whether her devotion will be rewarded with this miracle, there will be a 3-day close observation. YOU'RE SO SPITEFUL. IT TURNS OUT l'M NOT PREGNANT SO DON'T WORRY AND TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF. - Dad. - What? The guy keeps asking to meet up. - Who? Jong-woo? - No, not him. The mama's boy. Eun-ho? Yeah, Eun-ho. Whatever. Dad. Do you have some cash? Ms. JOO, we're nearing the deadline. How do you think you will feel when he wakes up? I won't know until he's awake. But there must be something you want to hear from him. I'd like to hear him say 'I love you' just once. Die. Just die. How could you do this to me? How could you be so cruel? How could you... How could you... Hey, mama's boy! You ran away saying that I freak you out. Now what? Thanks for the money. But are you trying it on with me? Did your mama agree to this? Yeah, I'm trying to hook up with you. So what? - It's your mom's money, right?|- It is. Ji-soo. I'm sorry. Everything was really my mom's idea. I promise I'll be good from now. All the bad things I did, I'll make it all right again. Believe me. Make it all right? If I sleep with you? Forget it! Tie me up with this. Quick. I see you've picked up|an odd habit. - You are a weirdo now? - Shut up and just tie me up. Tighter! - What's wrong with you? - My feet too. - I still have the ring on. - Tighter. That's enough, now leave. - What? - Get out. - If you need me... - Get out!! Call me. Okay? Jong-woo, I'm sorry. I didn't realize it was this hard for you. Please forgive me. Ji-soo. Jong-woo! Open your eyes. He's awake. Thank goodness. Idiot, you should have bitten your tongue a little harder. Did it scare you to bite harder? It's gonna get more difficult to breathe and to swallow. This was going to happen anyways. It's just sooner than we'd hoped. Yes. But don't worry about his tongue, the cut isn't so deep. It must have hurt. He was also weak. It's kinda cute how he stopped. Damn, so embarrassing. Ms. LEE. Your husband won't be able to control his emotions. Most of his cerebral nerves are damaged. This is how it works. Lack of his ability to judge will mean he'll cry more. And his mind will become increasingly unfocused. Leave him to do and feel whatever's possible for him. Okay? - Alright.|- One more thing, you know that he'll die|if he gets pneumonia? Be careful. At this rate aren't I already dead? A vegetable. A stuffed doll. The living dead. I have the right to take him with me! Have you ever been in my position? Why can't you do this? You think I want this? Can't you see it's because I can't take anymore? - You call it murder? - Yes, it is murder. Euthanasia is illegal. There's nothing wrong with the brain and we must do everything in our power to preserve his life. - That's enough. - Take it easy. This is killing me. My brother and I, we both want the same thing. Look at him. You think that's how he should live a life? Just let him go in peace. He'll die if we release him. We'll be charged with accessory to murder. We're aware of your situation, so try and hold on. Hey! - Stop it! - Let me go! I even quit my job at Samsung! Spent all my retirement benefits on his bills. Now I have no money. Are you going to pay his bills? Are you? - Let me go! - Mr. BAE! - Calm down. - You're loaded right? You're paying for his bills? Let go. - Mr. BAE! - Let me go! Ouch. Not so hard. - Doesn't it feel good? Shall I rub harder? - Why don't you just skin me? - Jong-woo. Don't you feel guilty? - About what? - Don't you have anything to say to me? - Yes. I'm... not sorry. You can leave if you want. Me too. I love you too. That's not... Is she okay? Why is she spinning in broad daylight? - Your wheel chair's brand new. - Jong-woo, do you know what this is? - Triple Axel. - Stem cell must be working. You still haven't broken up with her? Of course not. Dammit. Thought I could go out with you. No thanks. Ji-soo, would you give us a moment? No. Good idea. I was thinking of taking a walk, you guys have fun. You're okay with that, right? Don't go. Stay with me. You like it that much? Are those tears of joy? Don't go. You always cry whenever you're alone. I don't want you to cry. Oh Lord, please save him... The sky's honest today. There's a good gentle breeze. I was confident I knew what I was getting myself into. But I keep wanting more. People can't control who lives or dies. Just have to be thankful they're alive. Every moment used to be so special. Now, I keep thinking about the future. There's no clear answer to life. The heart is the hardest thing to control. Greed is the hardest thing to give up. And the hardest thing you can learn is how to live a good life. Ji-soo. Ji-soo. Where has she gone? Ji-soo. What do you need? Are you itchy? Shall I scratch you? - Hungry? - No. Want a hug? Listen to the radio? Want a massage? Want me to change your nappy? What then? - You want a kiss? Alright, alright. - No, I want you to wipe my drool. I'll wipe this first, my prince. Desires and ambitions are the sources of misery. But reality continues to entice me to dream. Don't wake me from these dreams of mine. The Constitutional law, chapter 2, article 10. All citizens shall be assured of human dignity and worth and have the right to pursue happiness. It shall be the duty of the State to confirm and guarantee the fundamental and inviolable human rights of individuals. I'm done, Ji-soo. My body keeps telling me that it's over. That I'm dying. Let me die. Ji-soo. You have to help me. This isn't living. For me and for you, we need to end this. What's this? What have you got on your lips? Why are you being so corny? Be my lover. I want to depend on you. I trust that you'll protect me. Promise me your unchanging and eternal love. I know you're scared. But don't turn and hide your love. You shouldn't worry about the future yet to come. Always, stay with me. I want to share my dreams with you alone. Come into my heart. The one who has my love is only you, my love. Jong-woo. Could you sing me a song? I'll listen here. I'm tired... Please? Alright. I'll do it. There's one question I want to ask you. What is it about me that you love so much. I saved a man with my heart's warm embrace. Why are you laughing? Now it's my turn to ask. Did you fall when you first laid your eyes on me? I just thought that you were the one for me. My love, sent down from heaven. With all my heart and soul I'll make you happy. Even if you are born again I'll make you love me again. Ji-soo. You have to be happy even when I'm gone. It wouldn't be fair to be happy because of someone. It's not the way. True happiness comes when you can be happy on your own. Okay? I never had a chance to tell you... I'm thankful. And I'm sorry... I love you. There was so much I wanted to give you. I love you too. Jong-woo, I love you too. It kills me to leave you. But let me go now... The doctor says being brain dead means he's almost dead. What do you mean? Did he die? How can you say that like it's nothing? You can't keep him next to you like this forever. Let's just let him go comfortably. Let him go where? I said he's not dead! Let him go? So I can be comfortable? How? I can't. Who cares what the doctor said? You're not God! You wanted to leave that bad? You're really mean. You're so selfish. If I let you go, would you feel comfortable? I can't let you go. Can't you just stay with me? Wake up... Just for one second. Open your eyes for just one second. Please wake up! Baek Jong-woo! I have something to tell you! Are you listening to me? Jong-woo. REGISTRATION OF MARRIAGE You promised. You promised you'll stay by my side... You have to keep your promise! Open your eyes and look at this! Open your eyes! Jong-woo. You have to do this for me... Jong-woo... you have to do this for me... Jong-woo... Jong-woo... Jong-woo... Jong-woo... It's time to say goodbye to him. No! Don't go! Don't go, Jong-woo! Let's live together. Don't go! I know you don't want to go! I know you want to stay by my side. Right, Jong-woo? You don't want to leave, do you? Don't go! Don't go! Don't go... Don't go... I love you... I love you... Don't go... Please don't go... Alright. I'll keep my promise. Ji-soo, will you stay by my side? Are you proposing to me? With a chrysanthemum? Yeah. Stay by my side, and later... later... Send me off to heaven with your pretty hands. I have nobody... and when I die... You're really handsome. Do you like it? I'll let you go now.
