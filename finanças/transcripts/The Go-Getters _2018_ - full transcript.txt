What the fuck? What the fuck? Stop, stop, stop, stop, what the fuck you doing? Sorry, I thought you were garbage. - What the fuck, Kev? - You're late. You wanna tell me why I just woke up with all my shit in the street and my key missing? Sure, it's because you don't pay rent and I'm sick of finding you drunk and passed out on my floor. - I work to pay off that rent. - I'm sorry, you what? - I unclog the shitter. - I unclog the shitter. - I fixed this loose door thing over here. - Oh, yeah. This door? I sweep, I clean-- No, no, you pretend to sweep while you steal my fucking booze! I what? I've never stolen... Prove it, prove that I steal your booze. - All right, yeah. - I don't steal. No, not on fire. You know why because you drank my booze and you replaced it with water. I'm your fucking brother, man. No. No, you're a thief, and a liar, and a drunk, and a fucking embarrassment, Owen. Still. You can drag your mattress into the boiler room and live there. I can what? I can drag, into the...

I'm not dungeon garbage! You know, if the government of humane whatever came by here and I was a dog, they would arrest you. You got a better offer, take it. What if I just jumped over there and took my key back, how about that? - How about that? - Bet it's in your pocket right now. It is, it's right here in my pocket. OK, well I could just jump over this bar give you a little side to side, put you in one of these guys, I could go out, get my stuff, with my key, go back up and put my stuff in your apartment with the key. Yep, totally possible. - Yeah, it's totally possible. - Mm-hmm. Oh, shit. Hey, hey. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, you all right? Are you all right? Hey, do you know who this is? Oh, come on.

That's disrespectful to my face. Cerebral Paulie is an endearing name. No, no, calling me Cerebral Paulie is not endearing. I...

I fell in some gravel a while back, it got cut to shit. Are you bleeding? Relax, man. You're not gonna get AIDS from my hand. Oh, phew. Now I feel so much better. Thanks, Dr. Hooker. OK, your dick isn't going inside me stupid. How do you think you're gonna get AIDS, from a scab on my hand? Well, maybe from the cut on my dick. Yeah, I tripped down some steps last week, caught it on a nail. Now, who's a stupid? Well, I don't have AIDS. I don't have AIDS either. - Let me use my other hand. - Yeah, you should do that. OK.

Yeah, I'm telling you, what happened, it was so hot that it just like... - it turned into air. - You're fucking faking! You're such a fucking sissy! Yeah, you know what, I am faking, because you're the worst five-dollar hand job whore five dollars ever bought. That is why your pimp fired you 'cause you're bad at your job. All right, then five fuck you. Just give me my fucking, fucking five dollars and fuck off. What five bucks? What are you gonna do, hooker without a pimp? Frontier justice bitch. I have your money, I have your money, I have your money, I have your money, I have your money. - I don't have your money. - What?! Listen, this is why you need to get the money upfront, don't you know anything? Listen, listen, listen, listen. Wait, wait you need a place to stay, right? I might know a place. So... So, where you from? - Really? - Well, I don't know, fuck. I can't sleep, tell me a story, lie to me, something. OK. Once upon a time, there was an asshole douchebag named Fuckface. - OK, fuck you. - Oh, no, fuck you. Brockville. - What? - I am from Brockville. - So, I'm from here. - So, you wanted me to tell you something, - I'm telling you something. - I meant something good, - not something stupid. - You asked me, you fuck face. - You fuck face, you. - Oh, fuck you. So, how long you been a whore? About nine years, ever since I moved to the city. - How's that going for you? - Yeah, says the guy who's sleeping in the Freddy Kreuger room. - You should quit. - Oh, that's sweet. Being that you're the worst. Yeah, you're the worst John I ever had. You're like a little fucking baby. Ow, my penis, my little, little penis. Nine years, you'd be way better at hand jobs by now. - OK, dick scab. - Three months... If you said three months to me, I'd be like, "Oh, yeah, three months. - OK. - That's a three month hand job tops. - Fuck you! - Fuck you! Oh, what the... You smoked all my cigarettes? Oh, you mean the butts that you found outside and put into a can? Gee, if only there was a way we could find more. Jesus fuck! Quit whining and do something! Do you have family in Brockville or...? Yeah, just a grandma. She has this big house outside the city. What like a house-house? No, like a, like a fucking doll house. Yes, a house-house, it has a yard, two floors, it's all moldy and rotting. They're probably gonna tear it down, put her into a home, she's this crazy hoarding cat lady. You... you have no other family? No, my family was burned alive-- I'll fucking fix up that house. - You can't fix shit. - I can, too, I'm handy. I did this whole bar. Did what? Hit it with a hammer? Look, I can fix up your cat lady house and make it look livable. What can you do? Uh, things that are actually true in real life. Let me paint you a picture, OK. This city sucks and it blows and it's holding us up, and it's punching us in the face like this. - And? - And, it's turning you into a shitty junkie hooker who sucks, and me into, you know, like, a cool guy, who's hit a bit of a rough patch. A drunk, do nothing, shit for brains - who lives in a monster cave? - My point is that we can get the fuck of here. We can go Brockville, I can fix up your house and we can live in it. New start. I'm not living with you. I can barely stand looking at you. You said two floors, right? Lacie. Owen. Your plan's pretty stupid, Owen. - Your face is pretty stupid. - Eat a dick. - Eat a dick. - You eat a dick, you. So, how we getting there? ♪ I met you at the door ♪ Forty-nine bucks. OK.

You look like a serial killer. You look like a mental patient. You spelt Brockville wrong. Yeah, on purpose, it's a joke, it's a hilarious word joke. It's stupid and you're stupid and everyone thinks you're retarded. Well, everyone thinks you are a crazy whore, because you're a crazy whore. We are going to do this my way. I'm in charge, you are the drunk do nothing fuck up. I am the hustler, we're doing this my way. What is your way? We're gonna fuck the cars into stopping for us? No. No. You know that thing, Christians, they wanna help the needy. - Yeah. - We gotta take advantage of that. We gotta look more needy. What is more needy that no pants? Injured, no pants. Help me, my leg! I need to get to a hospital! - In Brockville. - In Brockville. Help this crazy whore who hurt her leg and needs to get to a hospital in Brockville. Oh, fuck, dude, say I'm your wife or something. Oh, come... that's... We're going for believable. Well, don't say whore. People don't stop for whores. People stop for whores all the time, that's the whole busi... Oh, my God, you've never fucked a John who had a car. Shut up, do your job. Help... Hey, hey!

Fuck that, I'll get hit by a car. No, no, no, they're gonna stop for you now - because I'm actually injured. - So what? Are you saying that I'm a shitty actor? OK, yeah, Brando, show me what you got? Subtle, I'm playing it very subtle. Hey, hey, hey! This ugly hobo got hit by a car. He got hit by a car. Ha! Are you all right miss? Yeah, yeah.

Vamoosh. I had to walk all the way back here by myself, asshole. First of all, you left me, you backwards country dick. Secondly, it's vamoose, not vamoosh. Vamoosh is not a thing. Thirdly, I'm glad your skin is chafey, now you know how my dick feels. It looks like you gave a hand job to your own face. What the fuck? Can we just, um, slow down for a minute here. Um... What the fuck, guys? My grandma's got a crazy, cat lady house in Brockville. Yeah, I'm gonna fix it up, we're both gonna live there. - I call top floor. - We're gonna get the fuck out - of this fucking city for good. - Fuck out of this, yes. - Fucking new start. - But, somebody, I don't wanna say who, but she smells like vomit and radishes, - bailed and fucked up the plan. - I didn't fuck up shit. You're the fuck up. I make shit happen. - You made me get hit by a car. - You made you get hit by a car. So, now we need 98 bucks for bus fare. - Yeah, can we borrow 98 bucks? - Ah, don't sit there. - Why, what's wrong? - You're not wearing pants. Oh, you noticed. OK, can I just say something? Um, you will never have $98. If you magically managed to make two dollars, you would immediately drink it away and be left with zero dollars. What kind of drink can you buy with two dollars. Grain, Ides, T-Bird, Night Train, Ripple, Two Buck Chuck. Ooh, yeah I'd probably get that Two Buck Chuck. But the most fucked up part of your whole stupid fucking plan, is in order for it to work, you would actually have to help somebody else. Be part of team. Be relied on for shit. And that, that's science fiction. In fact, I am so sure this isn't gonna happen, I'll you what. For every dollar you two mamo's make, I'll match it. What? Oh, that is a deal. That is a deal. Gentleman's agreement that I want in writing. Sorry, what's this bullshit? Now, we only have to make half as much. What? That makes it, like, twice as easy. Hey, Rummy, you heard this right? Yeah, Kevin's gonna build a house for all the cats to live in. - Witness. - Hmm, yeah. Oh, I'm gonna make you regret that napkin. I'm gonna make you fuck that napkin. - Prepare to get fucked, buddy. - OK, I will prepare for that. You do that 'cause we're gonna fuck you. Yeah, we're gonna fuck you right where you live, right in your bar. Maybe... Bicycle! You're just saying things you see, I can do that, too. Fire hydrant. Muffler. Awesome. Yeah, this is a flimsy one. OK. OK, you stay on lookout, all right? Mm-hmm. Excuse me! - Person. - Excuse me. I don't even know what you're talking about, so... Are you trying to steal a bike? Ah, I'm out for a Sunday stroll. - It's Tuesday. - Nerd. All right, you know what? I'm gonna have to ask you and your girlfriend to leave. I am not his girlfriend. Whatever, you're trespassing. How do you know that we're not students here? - Are you students? - Yes. What are you studying? - School finance repair. - Art. So, what's with the hack saw? I'm fixing my deck. - You have a deck? - I don't care for your tone. Yes, I have a deck. It is attached to my house on the beach, which is where we were strolling to, to the beach. You live in The Beeches and you're gonna walk there from here? The beach, actually. That's what you call it when you live there. You call it the beach, that's how I know you're not from there 'cause you just called it The Beeches, so, you wouldn't know, you wouldn't know where my deck is at. Is she supposed to go in there? - I gave you the cue. - You ran away! That was the cue! - Running away was the cue? - Person. You are the worst at everything. How's that bike lock coming? It's coming. - Person. - Ah, fuck this bike lock! Goddammit, it's like black kryptonite, it's impossible. Well, maybe if you didn't have booze muscles. They should make the whole bike out of this stuff and then that way bike theft would cease to exist. You'd still have to lock the bike. I know, I knew it when I said it that it was stupid... I'm just saying, you know, it'd be easier for me to actually saw through the bike than it would be for me to saw through the, the... Forty-nine bucks. First of all, you stole this. Forty-eight bucks. Second of all, it's useless. This shit is ten-speed man. Six bucks. Was a 10 speed, now it's just a bunch of metal and rubber. Oh, what, come on. No, look, this, there's still, like, six, seven speeds in here. Forty-nine bucks and a hand job. I'll give you a hand job, let's go. Please leave my store. Hey, Kev, can I have a drink, man? - It's been a long day. - Sure, five bucks. Come on, just one whiskey sour. One, one, one whiskey sour. Just one... just one... Just a rum and coke, rum and coke. Just give me one of whatever no one drinks around here. Just give me the Tia Maria and the vermouth with a melon liqueur, rocks. Do you have any Tylenol... threes? You know what I did today, while you two chuckle heads were out being stupid? I was here. Like I always am. That was my day. I don't get to run around having stinky fucking adventures. I can't even sit around playing guitar. Whoa, whoa, play guitar? I can't even go to the movies. I can't have a fucking second to live because my brother is a selfish, do nothing, piece of shit. You don't even know how to play guitar. Wow, exactly, Owen, exactly. You don't even own a guitar. Hey, whoa, hey, hey, hey. What you doing with that? - That's mine. - This is garbage. No, no, no. I've got plans for that. I'm gonna do... I'm gonna do stuff with it. You have plans for this? - Big plans. - Big plans. Fuck it! Oh, hey, look, I got a tip, whoo! What's with cranky? I don't know, he's mad 'cause he sucks at playing guitar or something? It's this fucking city. I'm telling you, it drives you crazy. I know, we gotta get out of here. Look, we gotta brainstorm. You know what that is? You know about brainstorming? It's when I say something, it gives you an idea and then you say something back to me that gives me an idea, and I give something to you, and then we just go back and forth and back and forth like that until we have a perfect master plan, OK? I'm gonna start. Dog-napping. Dumbass. No wait, prison. OK. Look, well, you think of something then. You're a hooker, I thought you guys were supposed to be crafty. Why don't I just fuck a guy and charge him 49 bucks? - I'm taking these. - Uh, no. Look, if we learned anything it's that no grown man wants to do anything to any part of you. No grown man. No, you can't do that, you can't just say what I say back at me, that's not, that's shitty brainstorming. Who needs to have sex worse than anyone else? Panda's. Yeah, I'm gonna fuck a panda, that's my plan. Come on, genius, let's go. You can brainstorm on the way. Stitching... Hey, dorks. What you doing, playing cards? Um, yeah, Mystic cards. This is Lady Saint Martha-- Cool, so you know how your dicks have never touched a real live woman before? Tucking your boners into your waistbands and what not? Well, Lacie here is a real live street whore. Yeah, I touch sad little dicks like yours for a living. Oh, I like the sound of this pause. Let's talk numbers. Wait, just start from the beginning. Twenty. Ten. - That's 30. Thirty-five, 40, 45, 46. Forty-nine. Forty-nine bucks! Dicks out, dweebs, let's get you all in a row. I'll leave it to you to decide who gets to go first. I don't know thumb war, rock-scissors-paper. Yeah, we wanna go at the same time. I hate to break it to you boys, I only got two paws. Yeah, don't look at me fellas. Yeah, no, we want a gang bang. - I'm sorry. - What? With the both of you. - I'm sorry? - What? I told you we'd be needing these someday. - Yes. - Are you guys shaved? - I prefer shaved. - Can I have mouths? I want her to look like she's 12. - Eh. - Jesus. - What? I'm only 13. - Are condoms compulsory? Are you guys cool with blindfolds? Not for the whole time. I like eye contact. What if I'm just doing mouths? Ah, OK, I can offer you like a crick of my elbow. - I think that we're straying from the original plan. - One of these guys... She's winterized right? We walk right now if she's not winterized. I'll pay you 20 more bucks if you take a Bluto pie. What the fuck is a Bluto pie? What the fuck is winterized? What is that? What is that? It's a musical chair. Like, musical chairs? No, musical chair. One of you lies face down on the ground and the four of us walk around you. - When the music stops. - Can I talk to you for a second? - Just a second kids. - Wait. Listen, I apologize for my friends. I know it's probably against the rules, but would it be terribly untoward if I kissed you on the mouth? What the hell? Is she backing out? No, no, I think she's... She's just, um, she's getting limber before the... You guys take gym class, right? We had a deal. Yeah, no, we still, I'm gonna, um... I'm gonna get you a few of those wizard cards you like, or I'm gonna hook you guys up with those. You guys wanna learn how to smoke some cigarettes? OK, hey, hey... You know what your problem is? I got a dick on my face? - Oh, wait. - This, this is the problem. See, that's why those kids disrespected you because they can see you. They see... they see this. But if we could find a way for you to touch the dicks of the people without the people seeing you, seeing this, then I think...

How does that sentence end? Just, you know... If he wants you to... I don't know. I'm behind a door, what do you want me to do? Just, if he would like you to talk or something then-- What? You want me to sing a church hymn? No, that's racist. OK, just like, maybe don't take any shit, or... - Don't make me do an impression. - I won't. Anyway, he doesn't wanna talk, OK. He wants to... Jesus Christ, do you even know - how glory holes work? - Yes, I know glory holes work. I'm the glory hole expert. I built the glory hole.
