Come on, dear. Wake up. Teacher. - Yes, honey ? - I can't do this question. OK, let's see what it says. Which one of the following statements is correct ? NOAH LAND Unlock it, son, will you ? - It's already unlocked. - Really ? It does that sometimes. There is a problem with the switch. Sit in the back for now. I'll fix it later. Here. Some chocolate. - What's that ? - Chocolate. No, thanks. Not now. Put it down there. - Who is it ? - It's me, son. What's going on ? What ? Are you in pain ? - Didn't you bring your pills ? - Can you take me for a drive ? A drive ? We can go to hospital if you like. No. Fresh air and a change of scene will help. Are you sure ? You don't look good. OK, fine. I'll be right out. What's going on ? Why the crowds ? Stop up ahead there. - You want me to stop ? - Yes. Stop, stop. Just here. Where are we ? I think I know. This is the road up to our land. What is this ? Why have we stopped ? What's going on ? - It's the road to our land. - What ? Yes, it's the road. Follow me. - Water ! Cold water ! - Cold water ! Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Who are you ? Come with me. Let's find you some food. He's some kind of purebred. Selam aleykum. - Aleykum selam. - Aleykum selam, Uncle. How are you, honey ? Turn that toaster off. Someone's left it on. How are we doing, lads ? How many pilgrims today ? 1896, Uncle. Praise God ! Clear up this lot. It looks bad for customers. - Hello. - Aleykum selam. I'll have these. It's Cevdet, isn't it ? - Yes. - I'm the son of Aziz Karamusa. My name's Ibrahim. Karamusa... Ah, yes. - What can I do for you ? - We arrived yesterday. I know. I heard. I'm a sick man. My days are numbered. No ! May God heal you ! Where there's God, there's hope. - How can I help ? - My son's here with me. I want to be buried under the tree I planted as a boy. That's why my son came. Take your pick. The trees belong to God. Those old feuds are history. - Well... - Forget the past. - The tree on the hill. - What, the poplar on Hoca Hill ? No. The one everyone visits. - The Noah Tree. - That's the one. - Yes ? - I planted that tree. - God forgive you ! - Someone's put up a prayer room there. A fence, too. Here's the title deed. You can keep it. I have the original. What are you talking about ? If you'd clean up all the stakes and ribbons there... That tree is 4 000 years old. - I'd appreciate it. - Wait a second. -What do you want with this Noah tree ? - It's OK, it's nothing. - Dad, I... Can we go outside ? - Do you mind ? - Dad, I... - Do you mind ? Now, that tree is 49 years old, not 4 000. If you don't believe me, count the age rings. The tree doesn't age. But what do you know about miracles ? - Uncle, let me get rid of them. - Take it easy. Sit down there. Young fellow. Take your father away. What you're doing is a sin. Shame on you. No, shame on you. I planted that tree. No ! The Prophet Noah planted it. - Sit down. - You have a nerve. Go fuck yourselves! - Sit down and stop swearing ! - Don't swear ! - Come on, Dad. - Wait, it's OK. First of all, don't drag the Prophet's name into your lies. We're country folk, but we're not stupid. You have another agenda. I don't. All I want is to be buried under the tree I planted as a boy. Second, this is the title deed for Parcel No 54 in Zone 2. - So what ? - The tree is in Zone 3. The back wall of the prayer room is the boundary. Can you let me past ? We own the whole of Parcel No 54. You've got mixed up. You planted the tree somewhere else. I know exactly where I planted the tree. My friend, take your father away before things get nasty. - Bring the title deed and we'll talk. - You have it ! Screw that ! He told you to get out, OK ? Fuck off ! Shit-for-brains ! Sit down there ! Asshole ! - Wait ! - Come on, Dad ! - The title deed's right here. - Go on, mister. Out of here. God give me strength ! Get me some tea, nephew. What are you trying to do ? What you did back there was shameful, Dad. You ask me to bring you to the village. I bring you. You say they won't bury you where you want. So I drop everything and come here with you. I think maybe you have regrets. But I see no fucking sign of regret. Why are you like this, Dad ? Why does the world have to revolve around you ? What makes you so great ? What makes you so great, Dad ? You don't give a fuck about anything ! Why go after the guys' holy place ? What the fuck is Noah Tree anyway ? What is Noah Tree ? We came all this way. Why didn't you tell me any of this ? What kind of a man are you, Dad ? Then you turn up with a title deed like you're tricking a kid. What's wrong with you, man ? OK, you're sick. Everyone's sick. Mum was sick, too. Everyone has stuff going on. Do you have any idea what I'm going through ? I'm going through a divorce. Motherfuckers ! Sons of bitches ! - What's wrong ? - What the fuck is this ? Motherfucking sons of bitches ! See what the fuckers have done. Selam aleykum. What's going on ? Look at this. Like you need to ask ! They've wrecked the fucking house. God damn them ! That's too bad. I'm the local imam. I came to wish you welcome. Thanks. They've wrecked the place, look. Forgive them. They don't know what they're doing. They know damn well. It was deliberate. This wasn't kids' doing. They left shit all over the place. It was totally deliberate. Who did it ? I don't know. God forbid ! But I've heard what you said about the tree. What ? It's willful ignorance. Why would the Ark be here, right ? I've said so, but they won't believe me either. In the end, someone must have planted that tree. Exactly. Is there a hose ? I'll help clean up. The water isn't connected yet. - I'll take care of that. - I'll stick that hose up their asses. - Anyway, I'm Ahmet. - Ibrahim. And Ömer, my son. This is my family's honey. From Kars. I hope you like it. Just look at this. His father was the village head, too. They'd stop at nothing for a little bit of land. We packed and left. How did you two meet ? Your wife. Where did you meet her ? On the cancer ward. She's a nurse ? - Her mum had cancer, too. - I see. What's her name ? - What's her name ? - Forget that. Just tell me this. The land that tree is on, are you sure your family owns it ? - Yes, of course. - Well, okay then. We'll clear this up in a day or two. It won't take long. Let's go. I understand, I've just been there, sir. But the gendarme commander sent me here saying it comes under police jurisdiction. And now you're saying the opposite. What do I do ? This is just a half-assed complaint. Don't do this to me, please ! These things happen a lot in the countryside. Villagers have their own way of life. - It's best not to interfere too much. - OK, I get it. Honey, careful. You'll fall. How did it go ? I just don't get it. They say it's a disputed land or something. - Let's have your ID. - What for ? The land registry will know who has jurisdiction. Forget the trespassing thing. What's done is done. What's going on ? The police were the same. Forget it ? Why ? Forget what ? They'll pay for what they did. Whatever you've done, you pay for it. For God's sake ! Great world we live in. Our inspectors will come to the village on the 23rd. The 23rd ? Can't they come earlier ? - I'm afraid not. - Oh no ! Mister, can you hear me ? Move back ! Breathe deeply. Deep breaths. Can you hear me ? Have you called an ambulance ? Sorry to hear about your old man. I hope he's recovering well. - Things sure get around fast here. - It's a small village. I'll pray for the old man after evening prayers, God willing. Amen. Selam aleykum. How are you ? - Just fine. - Praise be ! He looks good. We have to put on one of the patches the hospital gave you. What patches ? I'm not in pain. Come and have something to eat. - Have some braised meat, Ahmet. - Not for me, thanks. But it's very good. - I don't eat meat. - Really ? Why ? Long story. Hello ? Give me a second. Wait, Hülya. There's no signal here. I'll call you right back. I'm going somewhere I can get a signal. I'll be back soon. Go that way, towards the field. You'll get a signal there. - Here. - Thanks, that's great. Yes, sir. OK, I'll do that. The archive for that area was damaged in the flood. What flood ? No one told my dad anything about a flood. The building was apparently flooded. Before my time here. A big part of the archive was damaged. - Which part ? - The Noah Tree and surrounding area. The Noah Tree and surrounding area ? I'll get on your case, I warn you. Believe me, it won't be pretty. Are you fucking with me ? What is this ? Falsifying official documents, withholding, altering or damaging them. They're all crimes. You know that, don't you ? Don't go there. You'll be in serious shit, I warn you. Tell your manager I'll be back on Monday. You hear ? I'll be here on Monday. Fuckers ! Selam aleykum, fellows. Could I have a tea ? Thanks. Remember me ? Why do you want to be buried under that tree ? Sorry if I crossed the line here. You've never wanted anything so badly ? I mean, something you wanted badly without knowing why. I think rather than what we want, how we want it is more important. I'd be skeptical of anything that's not what both heart and mind desire. Skeptical, huh ? I trust my heart completely. In fact, I'd die if I stopped wanting. May God put off that day. - Have you fixed it ? - It was exhausting. I don't know if it'll work. You've practically let the fire go out. - Chestnuts ? - Haven't you put them on yet ? I've had an idea. If we gave that archive clerk some money, wouldn't he solve the title deed problem ? - Forget it. Bribery is a sin. - No, really ? Everyone does it. But does that legitimize it ? I'm not giving anyone money. You need to give money to get your own title deed ? What a bullshit ! Asshole crooks ! May God keep you from bad language. What's going on at the entrance to the village ? The digging there ? - He means on the roadside. - Right. What's that ? The village head's project. To stop winter snows closing the road. When the road's closed, pilgrims can't get to the tree. He builds a road because people can't get to the tree, but the diggers smash the roots of other trees. You think he cares ? Great ! - Who are we like ? - What ? Who do we want to be like when we're solving a problem ? That's what matters. "In times of chaos, it is better to sit than to stand and better to stand than to walk." OK, here's another quote from the Prophet. "He who is silent in the face of injustice is a voiceless devil." - Right ? - But that's not what I said. I'm saying make a stand, talk, explain yourself, convince one another. Persuading people and all that... Sorry, but it's bullshit. Persuasion doesn't work. Talking can't teach anyone anything. It's actions that matter, not words. Actions, what you do. Those actions define you. Have there never been times when you've thought... "Hell, I wish I hadn't done what I did there." How many people have you hurt, for example ? In what ways have you been selfish, for example ? I may not be talking about regrets, but is there nothing you thought you could've done differently ? - Have you never had times like that ? - Not me. Well, Dad. That's great. Aren't you the lucky one ! I'll go to the bathroom. Did I do something wrong without realizing ? I don't know. I don't know the man any better than you. I don't know what upsets him. I'm just getting to know him. Forget what he says about the tree. Let's find a spot in the cemetery and give him a normal burial. That can be arranged. Good. I'm cold. I'm going inside. No. You remember it wrong. We played somewhere else, not on Noah Hill. Remember lame Rüstem's field ? We played there. Can I get you another tea ? No. We'll resolve the few remaining issues with your help, God willing ! It's no big deal. Nothing's a big deal as long as you're around. Thank you. Why don't I take you to my place for some tea ? - No. I'm fine here. - But please. It'll be a break for everyone. - My wife's baked pastries especially. - We have to get to the next village. Mr. District Governor, can I say something ? Go ahead. I'm Ibrahim Bastürk. From this village. In fact it was me who planted their so-called Noah Tree. For goodness sake ! Years ago, there was a territorial dispute between the two families. We had to leave the village as a result. I say I planted the tree, but no one believes me. But never mind that. The land that the tree is on belongs to my family. We've asked the land registry for the title deed, but they say there was a flood in the archive. So, could I perhaps ask you... to give the word for that title deed to be found ? If something happens to me, I'll hold them responsible. Don't worry, sir. I won't let anything happen to you. Don't worry, they're good people. Write a petition for the title deed. And my people will take care of you. Actually, the thing is... Actually, we already filed a petition. He's upset about a bygone issue. I'm sorry, he's giving you a headache. This woman came by. And ? She said she was pregnant. And that it was thanks to the tree. I need lemon. - Lemon. - Lemon ? - Where are they ? - On top of the fridge. - How many do you want ? - One. Thanks. The woman's a teacher, though. The village teacher. Must've been a coincidence. She said people need hope. She said to leave the tree alone. What do you think we should do ? You're asking me ? Why's the tree so important to you ? Father, was it really you who planted it ? Why would I lie to you ? Did you plant it or not ? - Was that a yes ? - Yes. Were you alone ? Was there anyone with you ? My father was there. Ömer, it looks pretty full here. There should be more space over there. Shall we take a look ? Selim ! Yavuz ! Uncle Cevdet ! The Noah Tree ! - What the hell is going on ? - The Noah Tree ! - What's going on ? - Uncle, the Noah Tree ! Quick ! What the fuck are you doing ? This place has to be cleared ! You have to clear all these fences ! - Get off ! - I want the place spotless. Get off ! Fuck you ! You fucker ! What the fuck are you doing ? Fucking cunts ! - What the fuck are you doing ? - Ömer ! - Get off ! - Ömer ! What's going on ? Fucking cunts ! Who planted this tree ? - Who planted this tree ? - Go ! - Who planted this tree ? - Read the board. - Get these bastards out of here ! - Who ? I planted this tree ! I planted it ! Keep out of our village, godless bastards ! - To hell with your religion ! - Fuck off ! - Ömer ! - OK. Go ! If you touch a hair on my son's head, I'll fuck each and every one of you ! My days are numbered. I'll burn down the tree, then the village. Take your father away. You'll turn the tree against us. We don't even pick the fruit for fear of hurting it. Shame on you ! - Uncivilized bastards ! - Uncle, these men... I'll beat you up ! Enough ! Enough ! Come on, put them back ! Enough ! Enough already ! Come on, let's go ! Bastards ! Move ! I told you guys a thousand times not to curse in front of me ! Son. Do you blame me for your mother's death ? I didn't do anything bad by leaving. Maybe I even did a good thing. I spared your mum and you from the trouble of living with a man like me. You see what I mean ? You might even thank me for it one day. Sometimes parents have to wait for their kids to grow up, only then they can understand their parents. Cruel, isn't it ? I wasn't a good father. But if I'd stayed, I wouldn't have been a good father either. I'm not a bad person, son. But you can't be angry at a man who's aware of his inadequacy. All you can do is to pity him. You're so stuck in the past that you can't live the moment. You can't live the future. Look who's talking ! Aren't you here to avenge the past, Dad ? Revenge ? No. There's a very fine line between revenge and justice. I'm here for justice. - So you don't care about the tree. - That's not what I said. That's not what I said. What's going to happen with this hate of yours ? Why do we have to just love or hate ? Why do we have to be stuck in these two extremes ? Is it so hard to be somewhere in the middle ? Stop looking at me like I killed your mother. It has nothing to do with Mum. Everyone dies. We all will. It's not about that. It kills me that you made Mum and me crawl to those shitty uncles. It kills me that they'd sit in front of us swinging their dicks. They ruled my entire life just because they had more money. I was such a smart, sweet kid. I was so gifted. But those fuckers screwed it all up. Mum didn't even open her mouth. They've turned me into this rude, intolerant man. Still to this day those assholes invade my dreams. I yell, I scream, but no sound comes out, Dad. Then I wake up crying. I'm 41 ! Dad, I'm 41 years old. And I'm still dealing with this shit. Mum wasn't there, I was all alone and you'd already fucked off. I was so mean to Mum. All the resentment, the anger, the hate I had towards you... I threw it all in her face. Every day. I didn't say a single nice word to her. Right up until she died. Do you understand that, Dad ? Mum died in my arms. She died in my arms. Her body went cold in my arms. Her feet used to freeze so I'd massage them every night. And this woman was always looking me in the eye. She kept looking me in the eye so I'd say something nice, Dad. I didn't say one nice word to her. She always had a look that said, "Son, it's not my fault." I hurt her so badly, Dad Who am I supposed to apologize to now ? Who am I supposed to apologize to now ? And you stand there saying I'll thank you. I'll never thank you. Wait, what are you doing ? Stop ! I'm backing up the car. Go back ! Hey, I'm backing up the car ! Go back. Selam aleykum. What's going on ? Aleykum selam. It's a dead end. Drive by or let me back up the hill. If you take country roads you don't know you'll get stuck, God forbid. Everything happens for a reason. So now we're here, let's have a chat. - I can't. I'm in a hurry. - Come on. - Come on, it'll be fine. - Let me just... Come down here. Look, the Lord's blessed us with rain. Let's get wet in this holy rain. How are you ? Fine, thanks. How are you ? - I'm fine, too, thanks. - So, go ahead. I just wanted to apologize for what happened that morning. Hard to keep young men in line, you know. It's fine. I'm sorry, too. I lost it when I saw my father like that. Well, who wouldn't ? I won't drag this out in the rain. I'll get right to the point if that's OK. Let's say the land the tree is on belongs to your father's family. I haven't seen the title deed yet, but let's just say it does. We've looked after the land last 50 years. Who's plowed the soil, who's watered it ? We have. To put it another way, we're the father of the child. Now, a man turns up after 50 years saying he's the father of the child. I mean, if you're the father of the child, why haven't you been to see that child in 50 years ? If you planted the tree, why haven't you given it a drop of water in 50 years ? Look. Didn't this same man leave you and your mother and go chasing after another woman in Paris ? I don't think you should go there. That stuff is personal. We don't know what kind of life the man had there, or what he had to deal with. Do we ? Sorry, but we can't judge him on that. - And you, least of all. Sorry. - Sorry, it just slipped out. Forgive me. Anyway, my point is this. Your father could well pass away soon, though may God put off the day. You'll leave the village and never come back. I know it. You're having a child. I heard. I was also sorry to hear you're getting divorced. You'll have a lot of expenses. So let me give you half the money in the account we opened for the tree. It's a sizeable sum. Make a nice life for yourself. Buy nice things for your child. Go and buy yourself a nice house in Istanbul. Make a home. But just leave this village and the Noah Tree alone, my friend. Please ! You think it over, OK ? Goodbye and God bless ! Look. I planned to use this thing to cut a wedge from the tree. For the age rings. I wanted to show you the tree's age, but then I couldn't do it. - You couldn't do it ? - No. They say it can kill a tree. Dad, why bother with this stuff ? It doesn't matter anymore. It does. It does to me. Do you believe I planted the tree ? Look, Dad. Isn't the land yours ? Isn't it owned by your family ? The tree is yours, too. You can do what you like with it. Do you believe I planted it or not ? Shall I put some more wood on ? Hello ? Hello. I was looking for Ömer. They directed me to this house. Yes ? Are you his father ? Yes. He said such bad things about you. I always pictured you as a monster. Turns out I'm human, though, huh ? I always believe the opposite of anything Ömer says. I'm Elif. - Ömer's ex-wife. - Ibrahim. Nice to meet you. You, too. Of course, he didn't tell you he'd soon be a father either. He likes secrets. Elif ? You must have things to talk about. - It's OK by me. You can stay. - No, no. I was going to... I'll go and do that now. So, how are you doing ? - Fine. - Have a seat. Or we can... No need. Let's sit through there. It's warmer. OK. Is it warm enough ? - I can put more wood on. - No. - Have a seat. - No, I have someone waiting. Who's the someone ? My boyfriend. - Your boyfriend ? - Why not ? You're kidding. What boyfriend ? You know I'm slow at these things. Besides, what would anyone want with a woman so pregnant ? How did you get here ? - By car. - By car. But who told you I was here ? Ömer, isn't why I'm here more important ? No. That you're here is important. That you're standing here now. Have a seat. Water ? Tea ? Can I get you a tea ? 'The Idiot', huh ? Finally. Yes. I finished it. Good. - Ömer, why are you here ? - How do you mean ? Isn't this the man you conveniently blame for everything that's gone wrong in your life ? Didn't you even try to pin our failed relationship on him ? - It's those looks again. - What looks ? Those judging looks. I guess I miss them. Even them. My dad's dying, Elif. I'm here to bury him. There's a place he wants to be buried. It's a bit problematic. He can't handle it all alone. I have to be here for him. He needs me. Shall I tell you why you're really here ? Go on, tell me. You'd rather express your hate than come into an unimaginable fortune. You're only here to pity your dad, to enjoy pitying him, to express your hate, that's all. Doesn't that also explain your sudden surge of paternal feeling ? What explains it ? You know what ? You wouldn't do anything for anyone else unless there is something in it for you. You couldn't. Why are you being so hard ? Why are you so pushy ? Why are you always telling me what to do ? Why are you telling me how to act ? Can't you just let go ? Accept me as I am. Please ! Do you realize you're always telling me what to do ? Stop ! Sometimes I can't bring myself to do things you want me to do just because you've told me to do them. And I don't. Don't you realize that, Elif ? I always feel like I'm doing everything wrong I'm so tired of wondering what it is I'm doing wrong this time. I can't tell you how bad that feels, Elif. - OK, Ömer. Enough. - No ! - We're not done. I want to talk. - Really ? Then answer me this: Who's going to breastfeed the baby when it's born. You ? Did I say that, for God's sake ? Then tell your lawyer not to file for custody. - She will. - What ? She will ! This is the only thing in my life that's been mine. I won't let you snatch it away from me. This child will admire me. I want her to admire me. What are you talking about ? You're being truly ridiculous. Please talk to your lawyer. And by the way, that Hülya fancies you. Take it from me. What ? Hülya fancies... OK. Really, that's enough. Talk to your lawyer. These aren't things to be discussed in a hurry. Please, Elif. Sit down. I'm begging you. Let's make tea. Let's have tea. Let's talk. Let's look at one another. OK. - Great ! - There, I'm sitting down. So, let's talk. What about ? What's left to talk about ? Ömer, what's left to talk about ? Please. Don't do this. If you care at all, keep the baby out of your issues with the past. Surprise me just for once. Please ! - One day you'll apologize to me, Elif. - Why's that ? You'll apologize to me. I can see it in your eyes. You'll apologize to me. For everything you've done to me. You'll apologize for making me like this. I put you at the center of my life. You'll apologize for not staying there. Our relationship could've been in a very different place. You'll apologize for not allowing it. You'll apologize for making me a man you hate when you could've loved me. You'll apologize for taking that ring off your finger so fast, Elif. You know what I'll do then ? I'll accept all your apologies. Because that's the way I am. I told you something, remember ? My tolerance will save our relationship, Elif. Can I have a word with you ? Surely a grown man doesn't need permission to speak to me. - We can talk right there. - OK. Son of a... So stubborn... - I found this. - Good. It's stuck. Take these. - I guess that's enough. - Thanks. My back hurts anyway. - Dad. - Huh ? - What did you and Elif talk about ? - She just apologized. - She apologized ? - Yes. - Why ? - She called me a monster, remember ? - You didn't talk about anything else ? - No. You seemed to be talking for longer. Well, there was the before and after, nothing to speak of. Just the usual civilities, "How are you ?" and so on, that's all. Dad, leave it there. I'll take it in. - No, it's OK. - I have more to chop anyway. It's fine. OK. OK. I see. But who wants those documents ? No, I mean why do they want them ? Is it the court ? OK, I'll handle it. I'll take care of it. Hülya, can I call you back later ? The land registry guys are here. I'll call you back. OK, bye. What's going on ? What the hell is this ? Was it you who sent the officers away ? Fuck you ! Get out of here ! Fuck-faces ! Fuck you ! Ömer ! - Fuck ! - Son, are you OK ? Dad, what are you doing there ? Get out of the way ! Fuckers ! Break it all, fuckers ! Break it all, motherfuckers ! Sons of bitches ! Fucking bastards ! No, there's no one here. - Where are you going ? - To cut down the tree. No, don't ! Ömer ! Don't do it ! - No, this shit has to end tonight. - Don't do it. - Fuck that tree. - Don't. Don't touch their tree. Touch whose tree ? The tree's yours, Dad ! No, no. I don't want the tree anymore. That's over. I gave up. Ömer, don't. They'll do something to you. Don't cut it down, Ömer ! Son ! Don't ! You'll get in trouble because of me ! Don't ! Ömer ! Ömer, don't ! Dad ? Dad, are you OK ? What shall we do, Dad ? What shall I do ? It's OK. I'll be fine. This soup is looking good. Dad, it's freezing in here. I'm closing this, OK ? - OK. - That's enough air. You know what ? There was a rock by the tree I planted. I've looked, but can't see a rock there. I don't think it's the tree I planted. For God's sake, Dad ! No rock hangs around for 50 years. Anyway they put that prayer room there. The rock could be underneath. Relax. I'm not going to touch the tree. Bury me in the small cemetery. - Your soup will get cold. - Never mind the soup. - OK ? - Is what OK ? That you bury me in the small cemetery. Dad, OK. But do you have to pick now... Is that a real OK ? OK. When I was in Istanbul, I visited your mother's grave. Before coming to you. I'm putting a lot of lemon in here, OK ? I'll squeeze this one as well. It'll be quite sour, but the bread will counter that. I'll crumble the bread into it. You need to get this soup down. You'll be a good father. That's so weird. Mum said the same thing. She said the same thing in the same circumstances. She said I'd be a good father. I'll be a good father, huh ? I won't be anything. - Huh ? - I won't be anything. Why do you say that ? Eat your soup. Is he asleep or something ? - Selam aleykum. - Aleykum selam. I've brought the window-man from town. Let's get this lot fixed, my friend. - Thanks. There was no need, though. - No, it's fine. Nihat is from the village. Shame on you. Assholes ! Dad, are you OK ? Dad ? I had a car like this in France. Not quite the same, but... Are you happy with it ? - Sure, I guess I'm happy with it. - It's a good car. - Are you feeling any better ? - Fine, yes. Better. This helps. Look. Look over there. That's where we used to play as kids. See that button ? You can heat the seat. I've already switched it on. Look, they're both on. But there's no one to sit there. Seeing as you have the heat on, I'll come and get my ass warm. I thought about doing that, too, but I didn't dare. Look... Mr. Tahsin and Mrs. Bedriye used to live over there. It's a wreck now. Those were the days... - Are you hungry ? - No, I'm fine. We can go find some soup if you like. - There'll be somewhere open, Dad. - OK. We can have a look. Fuck ! - What's the matter ? - Something got into my eye. - The ceiling's falling down. - That'll do. - It won't hold, though. - It will. - Fine, give me that. - Here. She said you're helping me here to prove to me, to her and to yourself that you aren't a selfish person like me. That's why you've come to the village, she said. What ? And that's why you want the child so badly. According to her, that's totally selfish. She said you didn't even want the child at first. You wanted an abortion. - I didn't want the child ? - Uh-huh. - Did she really say that, Dad ? - Yes. She said I didn't want the child ? I never said anything like that. Did I ? I never said that. It can't be that complicated. This didn't plant it. That didn't plant it. So who the fuck did ? My Dad then. - That's what he says. - OK, but why do you believe him ? He's always contradicting himself. The other day he said he didn't care about the tree. Who knows ? Ibrahim is... an interesting man. A complex man. I think he's afraid. He's afraid of the villagers. He's afraid they'll do something to me. That's why he acts the way he does. Last summer I told the kids that Noah's Ark never came here. Then the parents didn't send their kids to Quran classes rest of the summer. I'm an imam. It's my duty to share the truth. I also told the village council when I first arrived. They told me to stop interpreting the Quran arbitrarily. They ignored me. I'll fix this. And I'm going to stick that title deed up their asses. May God keep you from bad language. Hey, you won't play with me ? They say everything was damaged in the flood. The entire archive. That's not true. There was hardly any damage. A couple of tons of coal were damaged, that's all. - Coal ? - Yes. - So the archive wasn't damaged ? - No, there was no damage. Not as far as I know. - How much do you get paid ? - Why do you want to know ? Thanks. You're a star. He's a great kid. - There you go, Dad. - Thanks. - How old is he ? - Ten. Don't worry, I work in the public sector too. Just tell me how much you earn. Enough to get by. - The minimum wage. - The minimum wage ? - Do you want to make some money ? - How ? No, don't. Don't. Take it. Go on. Don't leave me hanging here. Come on, take it. I'll explain in a second. So you know the archive ? Get me a copy of our title deed from the archive. OK ? Get the copy and I'll give you the same again. OK ? - You're back ? - What's up ? Tayfun called. He mentioned a new drug, some new procedure. He's used it on a few patients, says it works well, halts growth and so on. - I'll be kept in for a few nights. - Who's Tayfun ? My doctor. The one in Istanbul. - Isn't your doctor in France ? - No. That's Pierre's friend. Sure, he's in France, but Tayfun... - Didn't I tell you ? - No. They went to graduate school together. He said to see him when I was back in Turkey. Which I did before coming to you. He said I should give it a try, that it could help a lot. - He'll try out the new drug ? - Uh- huh. - That's great. - Isn't it ? That's fantastic news, Dad. - Let's go now. - Not on the country roads at night. There's no need. We'll go in the morning. OK, fine. I'll go and pack a bag. - OK. Let's have something to eat. - OK. I'm all done here anyway. Look after the dog, OK ? Let me give you this, too. You can give the meat to someone else. OK. I'll take care of it. Thanks. I'll be back in the morning to see you off. - Good night. - Good night. Hey, boy. What happened to you ? What happened to you, handsome ? Who tied you up here ? Wait, handsome. Let's untie you. Come on, Cemal ! Let's go ! Selam aleykum. Have you seen my father ? Hilmi ! Round everyone up ! Let's check The Deep Valley. Let's go ! I'm half-tempted not to bury Dad. To leave him to rot in the living room at home. And let the whole village reek of death. So that those assholes can't sleep because of the reek. So that they remember the outrage they committed. So that they feel guilty every time they smell it. Sons of bitches. Sons of bitches. I'm not burying my Dad. I'll toss his body into the living room, lock the doors and fuck off. That's justice. We must leave justice to God, Ömer. What you said isn't right. Let's just find Ibrahim first. Then we can give him a ritual burial, God willing. Maybe the villagers did something to Ibrahim. No, what would they do ? - He tied up the dog and left. - But why did he tie up the dog ? Why ? So it didn't follow him. Mr. Ömer, this is the last place we'll be looking on land. I hope we'll have success. Carry on in line ! - Yes ? - So... I couldn't do it. I'm sorry. Sorry. I'm kind of dizzy. Just a second. - It's OK. Keep it. - No, out of the question. - It's OK. Keep it. - No, I can't. - Hello. - Hello ? Elif ? What's up, Ömer ? You know what the time is ? Elif, Dad is dead. Come here, my dear. - It's okay. Come here, sweetie. - Shall I take the baby, ma'am ? No. I'm sorry for your loss. Would you like us to come over ? Ömer ? Can you hear me ? Ömer... NOAH LAND
