We have eight loads of kamar betel leaves, six loads of maatu betel leaves, and 16 loads of patta betel leaves. Let's get the auction started. Chinnadurai, I'll get a good price on these leaves only if there's a good number of dealers in the auction. Don't push me. What's the rush? My brother Chelliah is playing a kabaddi match at Kulathur Nayakarpatti. Mr. Bhaskar, the coach of the team Tamil Thalaivas is here from Pro-Kabaddi. We extend our warm welcome to him. -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Rider out.

He is the great Potthari's grandson. Mr. Bhaskar will now take your leave due to his work commitments. You call yourself a player. You know it's out, right? Play in the right spirit. Stop talking, you show off! Show some respect! How dare you hit Potthari's grandson? Stop singing praises of Potthari's grandson! Did Potthari represent India or Tamil Nadu? He was after all just a local kabaddi player! I played for the Tamil Nadu state team against two states! Hey! -Come on, guys! -Come on! Kill him! Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ You guys trained yourselves to play kabaddi. But it was my grandfather Potthari, who shaped the game. You can't even match the energy of the gear he wore while playing kabaddi! Who do you think Potthari is? He is the son of Kaveri Born in Kalaiyarkovil He has no matchâ€¦ When it comes to the Kabaddi field Like the might of the big temple Thunder strikes when his name is taken This is the dance of the tiger He belongs to the clan of Velpari He hails from the land of the Cholas He can never be defeated This is the dance of the tiger He belongs to the clan of Velpari He hails from the land of the Cholas He can never be defeated Potthari, you've received an mail with a call about a government job! You need to go to Madras on the 24th of this month for an interview. Potthari, since the Arasarkulam village has never been able to defeat us, they are recruiting great players like Kanyakumari Rajarathinam, Muhammed Ali and ICF Prabhakar. I strictly told themâ€¦ to not select players from outside and to give a chance to players from their own village. Peramaiyan, let them bring in players from anywhere. Let them play their game and we'll play ours. -Okay. -Potthari, the match between Arasarkulam and us has been fixed. It's scheduled for the 24th of this month. Potthari has an interview for a government job in Madras on the same day. I don't care about the government job. My village's pride and reputation is the only thing that matters to me. You don't have to worry when Potthari is playing! We'll win and go around on our cycles celebrating our victory! This is the dance of the tiger He belongs to the clan of Velpari He hails from the land of the Cholas He will never be defeated This is the dance of the tiger He belongs to the clan of Velpari He hails from the land of the Cholas He will never be defeated He is a raging bull He is the God of Kabaddi His horns will pound you He flies likes an arrow You are the face of this village You will never be forgotten VEERAN POTTHARI'S FLAG CONTINUES TO WAVE BY VILLAGERS OF KALAIYAR TEMPLE A statue was built in respect of my grandfather even while he is alive. Don't compare him to sellouts like you who are ready to play for any team. I bashed you guys just because you spoke ill of my grandfather. If anybody talks ill of my grandfather or any of my family member hereafterâ€¦ I'll chop you guys into pieces! This is Potthari's house. Do you wonder why his house is in a festive mode? Today is Potthari's 70th wedding anniversary. With no luxurious setup and not too many guestsâ€¦ he celebrates his anniversary only with his neighbors around. This is Potthari's eldest son, Thavamani. This is Thavamani's wife. That's Potthari's eldest granddaughter. They are looking for a groom for her. You already know his grandson. The Kabaddi player, Chelliah. This is his second son, Sachimuthu. That's Sachimuthu's wife. This is Potthari's grandson who is currently pursuing polytechnic. This is his youngest grandson. He's in the eighth grade. That's Potthari's daughter, his son-in-law and their daughter. Listen, you and your brothers may fall at his feet. I might live off your family but still, I'm the son-in-law! Don't expect me to fall at your dad's feet. If you want, I'll bless him from here and he will receive my blessings. How about that? -Son-in-law? -Yes, father-in-law. Bless me, dear father-in-law. Bless me abundantly. -Throw the entire thing on his head! -Shut up. Come on. The entire family works and depends only on betel leaf farming. Potthari has two wives. His second wife is no more. The son he had with his second wife is also no more. This is his daughter-in-law. After her husband died, she cut all ties with Potthari's family and moved here with her son. This is Chinnadurai. The only heir from Potthari's second wife. Stop! -Uncleâ€¦ -No one is your uncle here. How dare you show up at this doorstep?! I am your blood after all, right, Grandpa? Don't I deserve your blessings on this auspicious day? Your mother was the one who cut ties with us and considered us foes. So, you too are a foe. -Uncleâ€¦ -Get lost! Buddy! Let's leave, buddy. Stop right there! How dare you set foot in their home! Did I work hard all these years for you to go there and embarrass yourself? You are killing me alive! We do not have any relatives or an extended family! We only have each other. That's it! They humiliate you every time you go there. Why do you still keep going there? I'll keep going back no matter how many times they insult me. I'll do it until our family reunites. The opponent is charging Without taking a breath He moves his strong frame And dives like a fish He may break his legs And we may lose our hands But the spirit of Kabaddi lives It breeds masculinity in men This game has transcended our nation This game has fetched us gold Across the continent Kabaddi is the greatest game in the world Kabaddi is the greatest game in the world Hello? Who's this? I'm Bhaskar speaking from Tamil Thalaivas. Sir! Sorry, I didn't have your number saved. So, I didn't recognize you. -I'm gonna give you an email id. -Okay, sir. Email me your Aadhar card along with the rest of your documents and details. -I'll call you back once it's done. -Okay, sir. -Thanks a lot, sir. -Email quickly. Sure. Hey, what is with that smile? Who were you on the call with? Mr. Bhaskar, the coach of Tamil Thalaivas had called. -Mr. Bhaskar? -Yes, buddy. He's going to give me an email id and I have to send my details to him. I see, but why? I have no idea about that. Could it be for the Pro-Kabaddi camp? Yeah, it could be that. Just give me a minute. Hello, Dad. I got a call from the Tamil Thalaivas camp. They have asked me to send in my details. -Nothing is confirmed yet, Dad. -Get lost! PANCHAYAT OFFICE KALAYARKOIL PANCHAYAT VEERAN POTTHARI'S FLAG CONTINUES TO WAVE BY VILLAGERS OF KALAIYAR TEMPLE Potthari used to be a great kabaddi player back in the days. Our boss also played alongside him. But Potthari played like a professional! Later, Potthari son's Kanniahan grew up to be a great player. Our boss' son also played alongside Kanniahan. But again, Kanniahan turned out to be the better player. And now, history is repeating itself. Potthari's grandson, Chelliah, is a kabaddi player. Our boss' grandson also plays alongside him. But Chelliah has inherited his grandpa's kabaddi skills. I don't understand the logic behind this allâ€¦ but it looks like kabaddi is an asset that belongs to the Potthari family. -It's the villagers who are saying so. -Yes, that's true. Mom, where's Grandpa? What's wrong? Hey, what are you doing here? You should be warming up on the ground instead. What's the use of warming up? What's the use?! I'm trying my best to get you qualified for Pro-Kabaddi, -and you ask what's the use! -My foot! You said you put in a word for me atâ€¦ Patna Pirates, Tamil Thalaivas and U Mumba! But you were just showing off! Chelliah got a call from Tamil Thalaivas asking for his details. They might give him a call back any minute now. What are you talking about? Hold on, I'll call the minister. Put it on speaker. Chief, this is Peramaiyan from Kalayarkovil. Tell me, Peramaiyan. Wellâ€¦ is there any update about pushing my grandson into the Tamil Thalaivas team? Peramaiyan, I spoke to the Tamil Thalaivas coach Bhaskar. He said that Potthari's grandson Chelliah will be a better click for the game. I'll ensure that your grandson gets into a Pro-Kabaddi team next year. Okay? You're good for nothing! Father-in-law, forget about kabaddi. It's only you who sings praises of you and your family playing kabaddi. No one else in the village says the same. You're the so-called village president and hail from a royal family! But what respect do we have here? Who graces all the weddings here by handing the nuptial thread? Potthari does it, right? Who heads all the funerals here? Again, Potthari, right? What did the minister say over the call? He said that they are going to select Chelliah, right? So, just listen to me. Let's send him to Dubai. He can work with his dad and take care of the company. Hey! This war is going on for the past three generations. If my grandson doesn't get the opportunityâ€¦ I'll make sure Potthari's grandson doesn't get it either. I wonder who she might be Where is she from? She steals my heart, with no mercy at all Oh Lord Shiva! Oh Lord Muruga! She's like the lightning Striking through my veins She flutters like a butterfly She chirps like a sweet sparrow Her eyes are sparking a storm around me She is a slender beauty She is a fully grown flower Her scent takes my breath away What is it? A vehicle just crossed by. When the yellow light fell on you, you were shining like gold! When the red light fell on your face, you were shining like a gem. When the green light fell on you, you were shining like an emerald. Are you going to pawn me? I've already pawned my heart. I'll kill you! Hey, buddy! Our load was kept on the bus. What were you doing when I fell asleep? The betel leaf load we had on that bus is gone. -What? -I'm talking to you. Hey! I wonder who she might be Where is she from? She steals my heart with no mercy at all So, that's the girl you saw on the bus. I'm sure, it's her. Your coach hasn't arrived in this bus either. A coach? Buddy, how about I become their coach? You want to be their coach? Do you even know anything about kabaddi? I learned kabaddi when I was seven years old. But you're not seven anymore! My grandpa's blood runs in me. I'm sure it's there inside me. You can't coach them wearing this dhoti! What now? I can coach them wearing a boxer, right? That's the same guy! Coach, looks like your grandpa's blood is bleeding. Your coach is here. You fraud! -Can I get your phone number? -I'll kill you! -When? -Go away! -Hey, did you hear the news? -What news, uncle? The one about your sister's wedding. I hear they are selling one out of three acresâ€¦ of betel leaves farm, along with the reaps. Do you know anything about it? Uncle, I guess they must've found a rich alliance. They must have planned to sell off the reaps to conduct the wedding. The land belongs to President Peramaiyan. He said he would take it along with the pump set or he wouldn't. Just to get his granddaughter's marriage fixed, your grandpa is going to leave all his grandsons stranded on the streets. Stop here, buddy. He just won't listen! Watch me now! Why are you here? Are you here to fix things again? We cut off ties with each other, right? -So, why-- -Hey, stop it. If you sell off the betel leaf farm along with the pump set, how will your take care of the other farms? Are you going to install a new bore well? This is the grove land document. You can sell this and conduct the marriage. Hey! Are you giving us alms? Look, my dad will sell the whole farm for my daughter's wedding! Get lost! Hey! You heard him! What are you waiting for? Get lost! -So, I heard your daughter had a boy. -Yes. I was at the hospital since morning. I just got home and took a bath. Also, remember I had a sixth finger in childhood which I later lost? -Yes. -My grandson has a sixth finger too! Don't cry, sweetheart. We are home. What's that bandage? The Doctor suggested getting rid of the sixth finger to avoid complications in the future. Didn't I tell you to leave it alone? What did they do to my kid? Like the feather of a peacock Colors are raining down on us Throw in a splash of color Our dearest Chinnadurai. In the heart of the heart Bari Jatam blooms The sky that shelters the rain clouds Even that sky will feel at home here The sky that shelters the rain clouds Even that sky will feel at home here We are here to celebrate this life Our friends and family complete us Ask for food And hundred hands Will reach out to feed us We are here to celebrate this life Our friends and family complete us Ask for food And hundred hands Will reach out to feed us Feels like the soft rain during A summer noon The sky that shelters the rain clouds Even that sky will feel at home here -You may all offer your prayers now. -Like the feather of a peacock Colors are raining down on us Throw in a splash of color Like colorful butterflies They flutter across the house The heart is overwhelmed with joy Look at them Grandsons and grandfather dance together All these good times are so nostalgic Everyone is a kid here Everyone's a slave in front of Love and affection here The whole village looks at us with awe The sky that shelters the rain clouds Even that sky will feel at home here The sky that shelters the rain clouds Even that sky will feel at home here Welcome, father-in-law. How did the plowing go? It went pretty well. By law, you have rights to half of your dad's wealth. How long will you keep the family's sentiments? Claim your share and lead a luxurious life. Why do want to work unnecessarily? Father-in-lawâ€¦ you're welcome here. So, just eat, meet your daughter, exchange greetings and leave. Shall I arrange for some booze? Please don't interfere in our family matters. Not just you, nobody can even dare to separate our family. What are you doing here at this hour? Well, there's a final match between Tanjore and Pudhukottai districts. We lost to them twice. We must somehow win this time. If Kanniahan plays, we can win and bring the trophy to Tanjore. -Fine, wait. -Okay. -Yes, father-in-law? -Please call Kanniahan. What's the matter? Yes, Dad? People from the Amaichur Kabaddi Organization are here. There's an important match taking place. The Tanjore district's reputation is at stake. -Go and play for the team. -Okay, Dad. Yeah. Dearâ€¦ is this the hour to play kabaddi? I don't have a good feeling about you going to play now. Don't go. You shouldnâ€™t play. Hey, it's my father's wish. Let's not argue about it. I'll see you. The rider for the Tanjore team is the famous, Potthari's son. We are proud to announce it. Let's split up and play. If he gets to us, I'll take care. Team Tanjore registers its first point. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Team Tanjore is at five points. Team Pudhukottai is at three points. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ The Pudhukottai team has caught Potthari's son. Hey, wake up! -Hey, is he dead? -What has happened to him? Kanniahan. Hey, wake up! Kanniahan! Well, Potthari knows everything very well. A kid's share doesn't matter but a wife gets an equal share. His second wife might have only one kid but they get half of his wealth. I demand the share of my daughter and grandson. I am suffering here and still am not over Kanniahan's death. And you're talking about wealth shares right now? What do you want to split? The sin of giving birth to him or the sin of raising him? Or do you want to split the sin in his life? Look at all the kids in this family. Let them grow and become successful. Then we shall split the wealth. Why split it now? I have no interest in splitting this family up. There, I said it. Playing and sacrificing your life for kabaddi must be a proud factor for you. But it's not the same for me. You woke up the person who was about to sleep and sent him to play kabaddi. -You killed him. -Mind your words! I know the law! Split every inch of the wealth into two! What makes you think you can demand us to split the wealth? -Thavamani, no! -Come again! How dare you disrespect me? -What else do you expect? -Thavamani! How dare you raise your hands on me? Would you've done this if my husband was alive? You raised your hand because my son is still a kid, right? If he was a grown-up, he'd have broken your arms by now! -Hey! -Oh God! Okay, so, you've trained your son to do stuff at this level. What else is there to see now? No matter what, even if any of us dieâ€¦ promise you won't set foot on this doorstep. Take your share and leave! Arrange for the documents. I shall sign it right away! DOCUMENT REGISTRATION Your grandpa doesn't love you. He is trying to cleverly brainwash you, split our share of the wealth and distribute it among others. Don't go to play kabaddi, if your grandpa ever calls you. You don't have any extended family. We are the only ones who will be there for each other, okay? Kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddiâ€¦ -Chinnadurai! -Kabaddiâ€¦ Continue playing. Kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddiâ€¦ Why don't you come and get trained to play kabaddi? So that I too shall die playing kabaddi like my dad? You don't love us. You just want to brainwash us, split our share of the wealth and distribute it among others. Look at how your grandson just spoke! My daughter-in-law accuses me of killing my own son. My grandson tells me that I want to kill him. Although I made that mistake as an innocent childâ€¦ it scarred my grandpa for life. My grandpa doesn't care about wealth. When I finally understood that and went back to him, neither he nor our family was ready to accept me. But I'm still very hopeful. One day, our family will certainly unite. We will farm on this land together one day. That will be the day my grandpa will say, "Hey, Chinnadurai! It's time to plow the fields! Ride the tractor!" Until then, I won't farm on this land. If you farm on this land, you can earn millions. I was wondering why you buy and sell betel leaves for a cut. There's so much of a back story. -Let's go. -Excuse me, I need to go to Kalayarkovil. When will the bus arrive? There are only three buses that go through this route. The next bus will be here at 4:00 p.m. Until then there are no buses. Here, this guy lives in Kalayarkovil. Chinnadurai, she wants to go to your village. Please drop her. Don't think twice. Hop on his bike and leave. You won't find any other vehicle. -Please come. -You fraud! Well, I fell for a beautiful girl and hence I lied about being the coach. You talk as if it's a big crime. I got mesmerized by you and lost betel leaves worth one lakh rupees on that bus. So, don't you dare give me that stare. Where in Kalayarkovil do you want to go? To Potthari's house. Potthari's house? Let's go. Here we are, at Potthari's house. Looks like nobody is in there. Potthari! Potthari. Potthari. The rainwater is getting on you. Come closer. I wanted to tell you something while we were on our way here. I had a dream last night. We both got married at the Samy Malai Murugan temple. We got married and were returning happily in an Ambassador car. Suddenly we met with an accident with another car that came across. And thenâ€¦ If I got married to a guy like you meeting with an accident would be my fate. The car toppled and you got away with a small scratch on your hand. The next thing I see, we are in the hospital. Then, I heard you yell from the inside, "No, I can't!" The X-ray guy then says, "Why not?" When I get in to see what's going on, the X-ray guy saysâ€¦ "All the metal ornaments must be removed to take an X-ray. But she is refusing to do so." Then, I say, "Take it off. What's the big deal?" And your reply to that wasâ€¦ "How can I take off the nuptial thread you tied around my neck?" -I was soâ€¦ -Stop it! Did you really dream about this? Yes. Are you gonna take me to Potthari's house or not? Fine, forget it. Potthari lives elsewhere. Let's go there. I know that would be locked too. Why do you want to meet Potthari so badly? Potthari had a son named Kanniahan. Do you know him? He died while he was playing kabaddi. He died because of my dad. Today is his death anniversary. I tried to visit him a lot of times but I couldn't make it. And, I wanted to make it there at least today. Is that enough? Hey! What's wrong? The Kanniahan you spoke about, is my father. Your father? Hey, please hold on for a moment. You know only one part of the story where your dad passed away, right? Butâ€¦ do you know what happened after that? After your dad passed away, my dad returned home and never stepped out. He didn't talk to anybody. Not even to my mother or me. He starved himself. He didn't even drink a drop of water. He sat there for days as if he was possessed. He went into depression for being the reason behind someone's death. After a month, he passed away too. Who is that? -Uncle. -Uncle? Did your mother ask you to check ifâ€¦ our family lost everything and are on the streets? I came here to check if the cyclone affected the trees. Though we are many and each of us owns only a little of this land, this is still our property! Get out! -But the fallenâ€¦ -I said, get out! I never expected this to happen. Fine, forget whatever we lost due to the cyclone. To save the remaining, we must tie those leaves to sticks and let them grow. -Here, there are 50,000 rupees in this. -Brother, it'll become an issue if they find out at home. No need. If you don't act now, it'll all be ruined. Tell them you got the money from your friend. Brother, Grandpa is here. I believe our actions must follow our words. If you plan on meeting and sorting things out with him one more timeâ€¦ I'll disown you too. -Hello. -Greetings. I'm Bhaskar speaking from Tamil Thalaivas. -Good morning, sir. -There's good news for you. You are selected in Tamil Thalaivas. -Thanks a lot, sir. -There's one thing you'll have to do. -You must practice on a mat compulsorily. -Okay, sir. Only then you can come here and get used to it quickly. Okay, sir. Thank you. We'll call you at any moment. So, be ready. -Okay? -Okay, sir. Thank you, sir. It will cost me more than three lakh rupees to buy a mat. What's that? Fake gold? Looks like this cyclone formed to wreak havoc on our family alone. What is it, dear? -Nothing, Dad. -Chelliahâ€¦ hand this over to your uncle. You won't let me wear gold even for ten days straight! Dad asked me to hand this over to you. Sachi, don't pawn the jewels. Enough of paying all our hard-earned money in the name of interest. Sell the jewels. Welcome, sir. This is a proud moment for us because being Patna's coach you're here to train us. Sir, our team has never been able to defeat the Kalayarkovil team even once. Please train our boys and ensure they win this at least this year. Sir, we have no issues with them winning. But, the last time they won they took a victory procession on cycles, and now they'd do it on bikes. They come in huge numbers and go on victory processions on all our streets, mocking us yelling outâ€¦ "Are there any men in this village?" When they do that, our blood boils in anger. Sir, I don't know how much time I have left to live. Before I die, please help our village win over them at least once. Sir, now that I'm here, we shall win and go on a victory procession there! You will lead that procession! -What say, guys? We shall win, right? -Yes, sir. We will win! Look, that's the coach training the Arasarkulam team. Like every year, defeat them this year too. Uncle, we don't care who coaches them. We've been defeating every team in Tanjore district one by one! And you're worried about our match with the Arasarkulam team? We'll make the Arasarkulam team bite dust! Just wait and watch! -Buddy. -Yes? Mr. Bhaskar had called. I got selected for Pro-Kabaddi. But he has asked me to train on a mat compulsorily. I can't ask my family for money after knowing their current situation. Without the mat, it's useless telling my family about getting selected. Can you do me a favor? I need three lakh rupees, buddy. Buddy? Well, all the amounts related to the sugarcane loads were settled today. I'll ask a financier who can lend you the money on interest. -Are you okay with it? -Interest? Fine, I shall pay the interest for you until you start earning. Sounds good? But, listen. Make sure you keep this a secret. Sure, buddy. Definitely. I've got selected for Pro-Kabaddi in the Tamil Thalaivas team. God bless you. God bless you. All the Gods I pray toâ€¦ must help my child succeed. Our hearts are brimming with joy The moon shines brightly upon us As happiness breezes through our home How did you arrange the money for this? Grandpa, the coach of Tamil Thalaivas, Mr. Bhaskar? -He has sent this. -Okay, dear. The clouds are showering us with happiness The night sky becomes brighter And glows in the heart The clouds are showering us with happiness The night sky becomes brighter And glows in the heart The seeds of hard work we sowed Has grown ripe for harvest now It makes us want to strive more And to feel the sweet taste of success Hey, I saved something from the pocket money I got. I want to buy you new shoes for your first match at Pro-Kabaddi. Excuse me, could you get me a ticketâ€¦ Hey, come forward. Come on, please. You're such a great man. You've helped and nurtured a lot of players like Cheralathan. What you did was not an easy job. Mom said you'd been seen playing kabaddi on TV. Is it true? Yes, dear. You can't watch uncle play on local grounds. I'll be sporting a yellow jersey with the number seven printed on it on Pro-Kabaddi. You can watch my game only on TV. Our hearts are brimming with joy The moon shines brightly upon us As happiness breezes through our home The clouds are showering us with happiness The night sky becomes brighter And glows in the heart At our doorstep -Grandpa! -What? -Say something. -What should I say? The recording's in process. Speak. -Recording? -Enough, come in. -Hello. -What's up, Sadagopa? Boiled the cane juice? What are you doing now? -Who's over the call mimicking my voice? -Grandpa! That's not mimicry, that's technology. Hello, who's this? -Call from Tamil Thalaivas, Bhaskar. -Sorry, sir. It's a new number so I didn't recognize it. Tell me, sir. Leave tonight and get to the Tamil Thalaivas office tomorrow. Sir, please don't mistake me. There is a match against the neighboring village tonight and our village's reputation is at stake. Excuse me, I'm calling you to play a match for Tamil Thalaivasâ€¦ and this is how you respond? -Sir, sorry. -It's okay. Be there at the Tamil Thalaivas office tomorrow morning. Okay, sir. This is how your dad threw away a government job to play a kabaddi match for our village. Look what it resulted in. Our family is farming and struggling to meet ends. -You better go to Madras. -Wait. Well now, you have your kabaddi teammates here, right? Tell them that the match against Arasarkulam is importantâ€¦ but Pro-Kabaddi is equally important. Ask them what would be the best decision to make. Like I said, he'd call me. -Tell me, buddy. -Well, buddy. Mr. Bhaskar from Tamil Thalaivas had called. He has asked me to leave for Chennai tonight. I didn't get it, buddy. He wants me to come to the Tamil Thalaivas camp. That's awesome! But we have a match with Arasarkulam village, tomorrow. I'm really confused about what to do. Fine, listen to me. If you play for Tamil Thalaivas, won't our village's reputation become even stronger? We have defeated Arasarkulam many times. We'll handle that. You don't tell anyone about Mr. Bhaskar calling you. Everyone is envious here. They will force you to stay back and play for the village team. You just switch off your phone, head to Chennai and join the Tamil Thalaivas camp. -Okay? -Fine, I'll call you back. Okay, buddy. Congrats. See that? He said the same thing that I did. So book your tickets and head to Madras. ADHANAKOTTAI PANCHAYAT Chelliah, grandpa wanted to play for India but that didn't happen. Even my father wasn't lucky enough. You're going to make it on behalf of us all. I'm so proud of you. Call me when you reach there. Our village must lose tomorrow's match. Arasarkulam must win. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Tell me. -Buddy, our village lost the match. -Yeah? The entire village is mad because Chelliah didn't play. Why Chelliah? For years, my family has been winning matches for them. Can't they win once without my family's help? Hang up! -Tell me. -I'm here at Tamil Thalaiva's office. They're saying no one asked me to come here. -What? -Yes, brother. I told them Mr. Bhaskar asked me to come over. They say he is out of station and had set up no such appointment. -Didn't you get a call from them? -It was a new number though. What number did you get the call from? 8056136718â€¦ Are there any brave men left in this village? THANK YOU FOR VISITING WELCOME BACK There's a brave man there wearing a dhoti! They peed on the outskirts of our villageâ€¦ and shared a video of that on WhatsApp. That is insulting. I wonder what happened to Sadagoppan today. His attack and defense were very weak today. My defense without Chelliah's combination is very weak! -Only if Chelliah had been thereâ€¦ -Don't take his name! Tell me, sir. What do you mean? In our complex? Please send it. Who was it? The building owner of the Thiruvaiyaru Chola complex is my friend. He casually checked the CCTV camera of the complex bike stand. He said that he saw Chelliah taking money from someone. -It was all recorded-- -He took money from someone? Hold on. Doesn't this guy look familiar? Isn't he from Arasarkulam? -Let me see. -Here. Yes, buddy. Hey! So, Chelliah took money from Arasarkulamâ€¦ and lied to us saying that he had to go to Tamil Thalaivas camp? No! -I don't think so. -Why don't you think so? I doubt him. Is there any way we could get in touch with Mr. Bhaskar? Hey, I got it. Give me the phone. Let's clear out the doubt you have. Put it on speaker. -Hello, who is this? -Greetings, sir. This is Kalayarkovil's president Permaiyan's grandson speaking. Sir, I hope you're not busy. I called you up because I wanted to clear a doubt. Tell me. Sir, you know Chelliah from our village, right? Did he by any chance join the Tamil Thalaivas camp today? I'm in Delhi right now and the camp starts next month. There is no camp right now. What's the matter? Well, I called you up to clear this doubt. Thank you, sir. Sorry. We must not let go of this matter! Hey! The entire village should know about this. Share this video on WhatsApp. Share that video as well as Mr. Bhaskar's call recording on WhatsApp. Do it now! This is Sadagoppan. My throat chokes as I send this audio message. I never expected this to happen. You would've never expected this too. We all very well know thatâ€¦ Chelliah didn't play the match yesterday because he was called for Pro-Kabaddi. Like you, that's what I believed too. But that's not the truth. The building owner of the Thiruvaiyaru Chola complex saw Chelliah taking money from someone, through the CCTV footage. We assumed he took money from Arasarkulam and didn't play the match. Hence, we called up the Tamil Thalaivas coach, Bhaskarâ€¦ and asked him if Chelliah had joined the camp. He said there was no camp going on currently. We were shocked to hear that. We went numb hearing that. I'm sharing both, the video where he was seen taking money, as well as the call recording of Mr. Bhaskarâ€¦ on the WhatsApp group our village has. Please watch and listen to it. This means only one thing. The family that this village celebrated, has betrayed this village! The villagers from Arasarkulam came on a victory procession hereâ€¦ and yelled out, "Are there any brave men here?" We bowed our heads in shame! Chelliah and his family are the reason behind that insult! Our village must come together and do something about it. That's the reason I'm sending this video and the call recording. Can you swear on me? Didn't I take money from a financier for interest that you pointed me to? Hey! Interest money? Did I help you? When did you ask me for help? -You fraud! I'll kill you! -Move aside! We are not gathered here to solve your personal problems. Just give your justification. I asked him to lend me some money to buy a mat. He said he'd introduce me to a financier and that's whom I took the money from. Dude, stop it. Fine, you said that I introduced you to some financier. Call him up right now and we'll know the truth. -His phone is switched off. -Try now. Put it on speaker. Tell me, Chelliah. Didn't I take money from you on Sadagoppan's recommendation? Sadagoppan? Chelliah, is there any problem? Hey, didn't I borrow money from you on Sadagoppan's recommendation? Hey, you took money so that you wouldn't have to play the match. What's the issue? -You heard it! -Hey! We have a call recording where Mr. Bhaskar confirms he didn't call Chelliah. There's video evidence that shows he did take money. That financier said he gave him money to not play the match. What more evidence do we need, sir? Whatever it is, we should ask Potthari to give his opinion too. Whatever you see or read on Whatsapp is not always true. The emotions in our hearts can never be fake. He's my blood. He'll never err. Son of a gun! Uncle, I didn't expect this answer from you! I thought you'd slap Chelliah! So, you mean Chelliah is not at fault and it's the villagers who are at fault? Potthari, for 40 years this village saw you as our kabaddi hero. Didn't we even celebrate you by erecting your statue? And yet, you're here taking your grandson's side. Like always, let's form a 15 members panel. They will take a final decision, announce it and that will be it. VEERAN POTTHARI'S FLAG CONTINUES TO WAVE BY VILLAGERS OF KALAIYAR TEMPLE After all, their greed for money has led our village to lose its respect and reputation. There's one more thing. "This village is nothing without our family" And, "Without our family's help, this village will never win any kabaddi match" These are the illusions made by Potthari's family in this village. Kabaddi is not a one-man game. No one from Potthari's familyâ€¦ will ever be allowed to play for our village. This is the panel's final decision. Not just that. The village's kabaddi team name "Potthari Kabaddi Team"â€¦ will be replaced with the old nameâ€¦ and played under the name "Kalayarkovil Bulls" -Bang on point, president! -Superb! -These unfaithful people deserve it! -Hey! We don't need a statue for Potthari after all this. Let's break it! Just because people don't talk they're getting on everyone's nerves. POTTHARI Hey! Chelliah getting sold out is going viral on WhatsApp all over the village. Forward the same to the Tamil Thalaivas coach Bhaskar. Hey, go look for him. I've my eyes on him. He's standing on the road outside. Brotherâ€¦ That number you gave me saying it was Mr. Bhaskars'â€¦ I gave it to Vetri in cybercrime and asked him to track it. He says it belongs to some milk vendor in Kanyakumari. I'm also searching for the guy who lend you money. Forget that. Do you trust me? Who else would I trust? Remember this, one day the truth will come to light. We'll grab Sadagoppan by the collar, with evidence in hand! So what if you can't play for the village team? You'll play for India and Pro-Kabaddi teams! Who can stop that? Don't think about anything and sleep peacefully, brother. Chelliahâ€¦ why did you not tell me about borrowing money on interest? I'm not broke enough that I can't help you with a couple of lakh rupees. Fine. Forget whatever has been lost. Don't confuse yourself. Go and have food. He says he's tired and wants to sleep. Let him sleep now. I shall wake him up and serve him food later. This is Bhaskar speaking. This is not a good start. A lot of bad things about you have come to my knowledge. Being a good, talented player is important. But, honesty is even more important. I need you to forget Pro-Kabaddi for good. Chelliah! I was sleeping out on the veranda thinking my son was sleeping inside. I didn't see him walk out! But, God has deceived me! Dear! Our son is supposed to do your final rites but you're going to do his! Stop, right there! Chelliahâ€¦ You took all our wealth and our family went broke. My son didn't want to burden the family and borrowed moneyâ€¦ and that resulted in him taking his life! Get out! -Let me see his face just once. -I said, leave! My heart cannot endure this No heart can endure this A tragedy beyond our comprehension The flowers I collected Did not reach God They burnt to fumes On the wretched path The undying river Dried up before my eyes All my dreams and hopes have gone to dust In the absence of the sun The lamp shows the way Chelliah, in your absence I have no one When the river dries up The well provides water Chelliah you're all I had There is no grain without the seed Chelliah without you My life will cease The undying river Dried up before my eyes All my dreams and hopes, have gone to dust I agreed to this conspiracy only because I needed money. I didn't expect him to commit suicide. Chelliah's brother is hunting for me. So is the Arasarkulam village for tarnishing their reputation. And you both are threatening to kill my wife and kids. We should tell everybody the truth. It will be the right thing to do. He's right. Truth always triumphs. On the occasion -of our village deity's festival, -Stop here. a meeting will be held at 5:00 p.m. today. We request you all to join us and share your thoughts and ideas with us. We must attend that meeting today. The entire village despises us. Why should we attend it? The village might despise us but not our deity Mariamman. As discussed, every family must contribute 1000 rupees. We don't need contributions from one family though. Becauseâ€¦ we don't need money from the family that betrayed our village. We don't need their money to conduct our deity's festival. As usual, the cradle ritual will be in the afternoon for our deity Sudukaadu Mariamman. A kabaddi match between the married and unmarried guys will take place in the evening. -Okay? -How can you make that call? -Whom should we ask? -Our family! Because we are the first family to conduct this festival. Not only us, it's been conducted from our forefathers' time. Only after our family ties the cradleâ€¦ and kick starts the ritual by breaking the ashes pot for deity Sudukaadu Mariamman, the village can offer their prayers! You may change any rules, -but not the tradition of the temple! -He has a point. This temple festival was kick-started by the Potthari family. How can we conduct it if their family is expelled? How can we conduct the kabaddi match? A lot of people here have the same question too. Let's not expel them. Let them participate. What will they do even if they're a part of it? They can't offer prayers due to Chelliah's death. What else will they do? The only guy who could play kabaddi is no more. Do you think the married and the yet-to-be-married candidates from that family, can step into corresponding teams and play kabaddi? Let's do one thing. We'll have a "Break the pot" game. Let Potthari himself take part in it and try breaking the pot. Hey! I've been patient enough! How dare you target one family and blame them for betraying you? My brother is not alive to prove his innocence. He says let's conduct a "Break the pot" game for Potthariâ€¦ and the entire village is laughing at it! My grandpa has represented this village for 40 years, playing kabaddi. My father for ten years and my brother for five years. And that's the sin we committed. What else did we do? I heard the panel has decided that nobody from Potthari's family should play in the village team. I say this out of arrogance! Let's not have a match between married and yet-to-be-married guys this time. Let it be between the family you all banned from playing kabaddi, that is our family on one sideâ€¦ and the village on the other side! Let's face off! Bring it on! Hey! First of all, are you a part of that family? They didn't even let you do any ritual at Chelliah's funeral! And here he is supporting his family. Hold on! Potthari. Potthari's son Kanniahan. Kanniahan's son Chinnadurai. He is indeed my grandson. For 40 years I toiled hard and played kabaddi for this village. I made our village's name soar high in the sky! But, my family lost a lot because of that. Yet, this dear boy mocks at me sayingâ€¦ "Let's have a Break the pot game for them" I already broke the pot and did the final rites of my grandson Chelliah. You banned my family from playing kabaddi! Now, the first-generation player, Potthari, myselfâ€¦ will step into the kabaddi field at the age of 70. Along with my family, sons and grandsons. I shall play against this whole village, for the sake of my family! Look at this now, a family wants to play kabaddi against the whole village! Uncle, they walked right into a trap. They will suffer. Potthari just turn around and see. You called him your grandson and your eldest son left. You want to play as a family but do you have any players? This fatso? Or, your son-in-law who lives off you. Will you play with that son of yours? You study at a Polytechnic college, right? Do you know to play kabaddi? Forget all of them. This dummy next to you, does he know to play kabaddi? You'll find out if he's a dummy or a warrior that will stab you, on the day of the Sudukaadu Mariamman festival! This match is a fight for justice, to avenge my brother Chelliah's death! When Chelliah was born, we put him in a cradle and offered prayers to this deity. We did his last rites in front of this very deity Mariamman. This kabaddi match must take place in front of the same temple! Deity Mariamman witnessed everything and now let her witness this match too! If we lose by any chance, we'll consider it as a loss to the deity Sudukaadu Mariamman for my brother's sin. We'll give up rights as the family that does the initial rituals. If we win, then it's deity Mariamma's word that my brother was innocent. This will happen! Knock down anyone who dares to touch you Attack anyone who dares to oppose you -Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Knock down anyone who dares to touch you -Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Attack anyone who dares to oppose you There he is. Mom, take him inside and serve him a feast. He wanted to somehow make his way into this family, he got his opportunity and here he is! Uncle, it's true that I wanted us to reunite. But, those were not my intentions yesterday. It was my brother who was insulted and died. My grandfather stood there embarrassed. That's why I spoke. But you've misunderstood that and it'll never change. But I tell you this now, even if you invite me, I won't step inside this house. I won't even drink water from here. But in memory of our late Chelliah, we must form a team named the "Chelliah Memorial Team" and win against this village! Only then Chelliah's soul will rest in peace. We'll stay split. But let's stand together against the village. Don't you guys think he has a point? When the entire village insulted us, only his blood boiled in rage! What's with the newfound love for your grandson? Brother, it's between the village and our family. -Why are you holding on to old grudges? -Look at him! Hear me out all of you! Just mind your business! If anyone goes behind my back and decides otherwise, you'll have to face my wrath! Move! Buddy, the villagers warned me from talking to you and asked me to keep you away. I just asked them one question. "All these days I was an outsider but now you consider me one of you?" Nobody had an answer! Guess what, boss? Yesterday, in Thiruvaiyaruâ€¦ Potthari's family was performing final rites for their boy. Chinnadurai was there too but he did the rites separately. Yeah, right! By the time their family unites, the temple deity's festival will be over! Why would he wanna play kabaddi instead of doing his betel business for a cut? Why are you limping, buddy? Oh! So you learn to mark the kabaddi field? Good job with the court but now I'll be the rider, what are you going to do? Run away? -Let's see who runs away! Come on. -Really? -Here I come. -Come on. -Ready? -Come on! -Come on! -Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Out! You were challenging me? Now what? Uncle. Uncle! He caught me because I was standing alone. Will you play with me? So that they will throw me out of the family like they did you? -Sorry, I can't join you. -Uncle, got scared, right? -Go. -Shall I? -Come. -Come on. -Watch me now. -Now, come on! -I don't care how many of you are there. -Come on. Go and play with your cousin and uncle. -Grandpa? -Just go! Him too? Fine. Your grandma might come next. Save some space for her. -Awesome! -Make it fast, come on! I got work. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Why is he hitting instead of touching? Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Why did you hit the kid? Not just your kid, if you play, I'll hit you too. How dare you slap my son and now you say you'll slap me? Bring it on! Come on! -Come on! I'll face all of you. -Superb. Uncle, stand here. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ How was that beating? Tell him "Not just you, I'll hit your whole family" -Not just you, I'll hit your whole family -What? Hey! How dare you talk like that in front of us? Do you think you're better than Potthari? Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Sister-in-lawâ€¦ Mother-in-lawâ€¦ I'm suffering in pain after losing my son! Is your ego going to bring back my son? The least you could do is let my son's dignity and pride be upheld. Uncle, Chelliah died for no fault of his own. Like Chinnadurai said, let's play kabaddi in the name of Chelliahâ€¦ and win against this village. Knock down anyone who dares to touch you Attack anyone who dares to oppose you -Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Knock down anyone who dares to touch you -Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Attack anyone who dares to oppose you Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ We will come in charging We will score away the points We will sneak and peak We will stagger the field This is a roller coaster ride Unfolding before your eyes Keep a safe distance from us You might get hurt Fly like a bullet before Your opponent touches you Pounce like a tiger Even the toughest challenger must tremble In your fiercest game Our own people have abandoned us In our own land We must prove them wrong Give me your best I will not succumb We will not bow down to anyone Our valor will not fade away Just wait and watch We will rush like a wild river No barrier will stop us We have never seen someone like him here. -Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Knock down anyone who dares to touch you -Kabaddi, kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Knock down anyone who dares to touch you Pure gold will never lose its value True relations will not let you go The love we share will not fail It will shatter the enmity between us It will and this is my promise Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Kabaddi! Playing amongst ourselves doesn't mean we have learned kabaddi. We must play against other villages. Only then we will know our strengths and weakness. Tonight, we'll go to another village to play kabaddi. Mom, why did you come here? Mom, let's go. Please, listen to me. I lost my husband to kabaddi. I don't think my son's time is good either. He just won't obey my words. Please leave my son to me. I plead you. Mom, listen to me. Come with me. Back then, you said that I was the reason for my son's death. Those words are still killing me on the inside. You may take your son with you. -Grandpa, come onâ€¦ -I said, you may leave. One lakh rupees as the first prize. Defeated the police team in the semis and the military team in the finals! We rocked the playground! Momâ€¦ do people only die while playing kabaddi? Don't say that. I was the one who issued the challenge. Instead of living for 100 years without any shame, it's better to live for a day with pride and dignity and then die! Dear, what do you mean? Where are you going? Sonâ€¦ Wait, dearâ€¦ Oh God! Oh God! Oh God! My son! Oh God! My son might just die! -Somebody, please help! -Grandpa! Somebody, please help! Oh God! My son! Oh God! Somebody save him! Save him! Dear, please look here. Oh God! Don't I always say that only we are there for each other? But when you were in danger, an entire family was there to help you. You go with your family. Just go! Go and play! Play against the entire village! I paid the entry fee. -Where are the others? -They must have gone to school. School? Come, let's go. -I'm hungry, brother. -You're hungry? Where will you get food at this hour? The shops will be closed. I'm starving, brother. So am I. Let's do one thing. There will be a lot of houses on this street. We can easily find out houses loaded with food. We shall knock on the door of one such house. Somebody will answer the door. I'll tell them we are famous kabaddi players. And we're here to play a match. And ask them for some water. When they get me some water, I want to you cry out and ask for it in a way that you're starving. They will ask "Would you like to come inside and have some food?" We'll go inside, eat and then leave. Sounds good? Awesome idea, brother! Brother, this house? No, it smells like veg food. A house loaded with food. This one, right? Yes, I smell fish curry. Shall we? Come on. Hello? Hello! Hey! Here she comes. -Who is it? -Greetings, madam. We are famous kabaddi players. We are here to play a match. Weâ€¦ -Can I get some water to drink? -Brotherâ€¦ -What is it? -Water? -I'm starving, brother. -Oh God, you're starving? -Poor child, he's hungry. -I've made some fish curry. I already poured water into the leftover rice. Shall I filter the rice and serve it with the curry? -Okay. -My daughter is also a kabaddi player. -Really? -Yeah. Do you see the kabaddi bonding between our families? -Usuallyâ€¦ -Auntie, some curry, please. Usually, when I eat at somebody's house, I always think of gifting them something. If you want I can teach your daughter the nuances of offense and defense. Call her. She's getting ready to watch the match. -Dear! -Yes? -Dear! -Yes, Mom? A great kabaddi player has visited our house. What are you doing inside? He knows a lot about kabaddi. Just hear him out. Mom, the great kabaddi player you are talking aboutâ€¦ is that him? -Enough, let's go. -Wait, brother. Auntie, some more curry. -I said, enough. Let's go. -Wait. Please finish your meal, coach. I noticed you coming here and so I followed you here. What's this bad habit? How can you eat at a stranger's house? Haven't I warned you about eating anything before playing kabaddi? I left my phone inside. Let me get it. The person in this photo is my father. THANGARASU IN MEMORY: 06/10/2000 I've seen a lot of kabaddi matches, but I'm seeing a team like this for the first time. An old man and a kid who is still in middle school. What kind of a team is this? Team Chelliah Memorial has won the toss. Kalayarkovil, choice, ride. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Out? He didn't even cross 40 seconds. How can you give him out? Why are you here at this age without knowing the rules of the game? Damn it! Hey, how dare you raise your hand at the umpire?! Stop it! -What was that? -But, Grandpaâ€¦ He might be wrong, but someone who hits the umpire can never be a good player. Grandpaâ€¦ you have got the rules wrong. A 40-second ride doesn't exist anymore. It has been cut down to 30 seconds recently. Oh God! Doesn't the oldie know the new rules of kabaddi? I wonder when he's gonna learn the new rules, teach them to us, when will we learn them and when will we beat our team. Grandpa, why do you want to play kabaddi at this age? That too with your family? Nobody can teach you to play kabaddi better than Potthari. Butâ€¦ in order to teach and update you guys on the new kabaddi rulesâ€¦ can I become a part of your family's team? We owe this family big time. Help them, dear. Well, Grandpa, back then when you played kabaddi if three, two, or even one of the players caught the rider, -the team would earn a point, right? -Yes. It's not the same now. Now, the team gets two points for it. -That's called a Super tackle. -Okay, dear. You carry on. I'll be the rider -and you be the catcher, okay? -Okay. The catcher must approach, push the rider by his chestâ€¦ and rotate back to center court. That should be the catcher's focus. -Got it? -Yes. -You take over, dear. -Okay, ready. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Catch him! Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ She has striking eyes Who is this queen? She appeared before me like a spark She took my breath away with her look She makes me jump up and down To heaven and earth She has striking eyes She is the queen of Tanjore He spoke to me with his expressive eyes He stood before me, face-to-face When I show him some love He pleads for more She has striking eyes She is the queen of Tanjore Guys, look at them train! They're running as if they have stepped on cow dung! Her beautiful cheeks glow like the moon I wish to fondle them every time I see them My flowing hair longs for a rose Will you fulfill this young ladyâ€™s wish? A withered flower will not last long Take me before itâ€™s too late You are the brightest fish in the pond No star in the sky compares to you You are a lush flower You are a fair flower She makes her presence felt Here she comes As the drums begin to roll She will confess it herself She has striking eyes Who is this queen? She appeared before me like a spark She took my breath away with her look She makes me jump up and down To heaven and earth She has striking eyes She is the queen of Tanjore He spoke to me with his expressive eyes He stood before me face-to-face When I show him some love He pleads for more She has striking eyes She is the queen of Tanjore She has striking eyes She is the queen of Tanjore She has striking eyes She is the queen of Tanjoreâ€¦ Well, I asked Chinnaduraiâ€¦ "You were all riled up when Chelliah died, why have you mellowed down now?" Guess what his answer was? "Forget all that and focus on Kabaddi" Your husband was right. He just wants to make his way into this family with some intention. And I don't think he's doing it out of love or affection. He is fully involved with that girl Pavitra. I would've kicked him if this wasn't a government office. I'll do it some other day. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ ORATHANDU PANCHAYAT UNION VILLAGE ADMINISTRATION OFFICE KALAYARKOIL Your land is just lying there. Why don't you put it on a lease? A lot of people have been asking for it. Let it stay so, sir. It won't stay like that forever. Welcome, Mr. Kabaddi player. Hope you are doing well. Have a seat. While registering for UPR, his land survey number was mentioned in ours. Please get it out of there, so that we can apply for a loan. Let's not split it, sir. Let the family stay united at least on paper. -I shall sign the loan papers, sir. -Enough of what you've done already. Just split it, sir. -I shall take your leave. -Okay, see you. What's wrong? You look disheartened. Is it about the land documents? I'm here for you, right? Hey! Grandpaâ€¦ Grandpa, I've set up the ground. -No one has shown up yet. -I thought you both were smart kids. I'll learn the rules by myself. You may go back home. -Grandpa, pleaseâ€¦ -I said leave! We have a match at Adanakottai tonight. Drop her off at her house. Also, leave every intention of her behind. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Looks like Sadagoppan starts his game by kicking the opponent! That's him! He is known to do that to every player in that spot. Oh God! That oldie makes me play in that very spot! Sadagoppan has single-handedly scored 21 points for the team, and will be honored with the title "Player of the Match". Respected Union minister, Mr. Ponnusamy, will be presenting a watch to Sadagoppan as an award. Toss won by Prabhakar Memorial Team. Choice, ride. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ -Kabaddi! -Why did he swear on my head though? They are definitely winning. Two points to Prabhakar Memorial Team. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddiâ€¦ kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Ride! Move! Kabaddiâ€¦ Come on, catch him! -Kabaddiâ€¦ -Hold him! One plus one. Two points to Prabhakar Memorial Team. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Point to Prabhakar Memorial Team. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Two plus two. Four points to Prabhakar Memorial Team. Kabaddiâ€¦ All enter. Even the electricity couldn't stand their game. Kindly bear the pain. Does it hurt? Well, here we are after losing to another village. Tomorrow's match will be a matter of life or death for us. Our family is going to lose and get ashamed! At that momentâ€¦ the entire village will say, "Deity Mariamman punished this family for their mistakes" It feels like you are hurting my son Chelliah over and again! Why are you doing this? He is the sole reason for our current plight! Ask him to go out there, fall at every villager's feet and sayâ€¦ "We won't play because if we do, we'll lose." You'll see me in a yellow jersey with the number 7 on the back in Pro-Kabaddi. You can watch your uncle's game only on TV. Hey, it's Uncle Chelliah. Hey, Grandpa! Uncle Chelliah is on TV playing kabaddi. Uncle Chelliah is on TV. Please come. I remember him telling me. He said he'd be wearing a yellow jersey with the number 7 on his back and will be seen playing only on TV. Please, Grandpa. Let's go watch it together. It's not Uncle Chelliah playing kabaddi on TV. But, I promise we will win the kabaddi match played for his sake. Come on. It's time to bury Potthari's family! Buddy, there's news about our villager Cheralathan. What's that? Play it. In the Pro-Kabaddi player auction, Cheralathan from Tamil Nadu was the highest-sold player in India. The U Mumba team purchased him for a whopping price of five crore rupees. He hails from Kalayarkovil, in the Tanjore district. Awesome, right? It's been long since we spoke to him. Let's call him up and congratulate him. My dear buddyâ€¦ Buddy, this is Sadagoppan from Kalayarkovil. Tell me, buddy. Congrats! Well done! Thanks, buddy. I heard Potthari's family challenged the entire village for a match. They betrayed the village, -and they will pay for it now. -Right. When the match happens on the festival day, I will play too on behalf of the village. That's not required, buddy. They don't stand a chance of winning even if I play alone against them. I'm gonna be there for the festival anyways. Along with rituals for the temple, let's finish them off too. Let's do it. -Sir, did you hear the news? -What is it, Kannaiyaram? -Do you remember Velu's son Cheralathan? -Yes. The U Mumba team has purchased him for five crore rupees. That's good news. You're calling this good news? In the match that's gonna happen on our temple festival day, he's gonna play in the village team against you guys. -Is he really that good? -Oh, come on. They shared a video of his game on Whatsapp. He kicked an opponent and now that player is fighting for his life. Already, there's Sadagoppan. I wonder who will tackle him among us. Then, there's a player called Natarajan. His movements are unpredictable! Then, Sampath, he scores points like sowing seeds on a field. There's another player called Aiyyadurai. He doesn't even have to try hard. Our legs will find his hands and get stuck when he holds them. His game is so electrifying! And now, they're bringing in Cheralathan? Who do you think trained Cheralathan as a kid and made him a great player? It was Potthari. Cheralathan's dad couldn't even afford his hostel fee. He came to Potthari's doorstep. Potthari told him, "Don't ruin a good player's career". Who gave him two goats, told him to sell them, and use the money to pay the fee? It was Potthari. And now, Cheralathan wants to play against Potthari! What bad times are we living in? -Tell me. -Hey. I've sent some video clips. Check it out. I'm looking for more references. You watch these, by then I'll send more. We must defeat them without letting them score even a single point. I'm sure you'll win the match. But that won't suffice. You must give a fitting reply to the family who betrayed this village! A sacrifice! Dear! -Father-in-law! -Dad! -Father-in-law! -Dad! Grandpa! -Dad! -Father-in-law! What are you doing, Dad? Why are you standing here? What are you doing here at this hour, Dad? -Father-in-law? -Blame my fate! Why are you standing here bare chest in a thunderstorm like this? Oh God! I was sleeping. My grandson Chelliah woke me up. It was him. He brought me here. In tomorrow's match, if our family losesâ€¦ then I don't want to live anymore. I will take my life too and go to Chelliah. -I won't let you die, Grandpa. -We won't let that happen. We won't let it happen! I won't let it happen. I won't let it happen! I won't let it happen. I won't let it happen. I won't let it happen. You will be the captain of our team. You have the skills and talent to save your dad's reputation. You have all the power to make any decisions. The players of Kalayarkovil Bulls are entering the arena. Head. Toss won by the Chelliah Memorial Team. Side or ride? Ride. Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi, kabaddiâ€¦ Kabaddi!

Don't cry. Is it hurting a lot? The injury is not hurting me. What hurts me is that I couldn't even score a single point for this family. Forget that, go to the hospital first. -Lift him. -Dear, you need not do that. You guys play and win first. Throw me on the sides. Deity Mariaatha will help you all. Uncleâ€¦ Awesome buddy! Looks like his leg is fractured. KALAYARKOVIL 18 CHELLIAH MEMORIAL TEAM 0 All enter! Are you going to continue the game with just six players? Not six but seven! I'll be the seventh player. They challenged saying that only people from their family would play. Are you part of their family? Can you marry me right here and right now? Are you kidding me? -Don't talk like a fool! Leave! -Answer me! Will you marry me? Grandpa, I know you're upset with me. But, I have a duty towards your family. Please give me a chance to play, Grandpa. Please, Grandpa. Once the match is over, I shall remove the nuptial thread, hand it over and leave. So, the marriage took place.

Both of you killed my poor brother. The guy who was seen giving money to Chelliah on the Whatsapp video, Kannayiram saw him at your sugarcane factory. He found a skull one day while cleaning the sugarcane factory. He brought it to me. It sparked a doubt in my head. The DNA test reportsâ€¦ confirmed that it was indeed that financier who died. I'd have thrown both of them in prison. But, I didn't want it to look like a reason for us not to play this match. My brother Chelliah cried his heart out telling you guys thatâ€¦ he borrowed that money on interest! Did anyone of you believe him? Those two alone aren't the reason for Chelliah's death. The whole village is responsible. We wanted to punish this village. That's why my grandpa and I challenged to defeat the entire village in kabaddi. We won. We proved ourselves! I'd have told you all about this back then, but I chose not to so that it wouldn't divert your focus from kabaddi. Forgive me. -Forgive me tooâ€¦ -Hey! Who will plead for forgiveness to my late little brother? Chinnadurai, leave him! We need not punish anyone. Karma will get them. Go. Chinnadurai. Why are you headed in that direction? Our house is this way. Come on. Uncle! Let's go to our house. Come on, Uncle. Let's go home, Uncle. -Come on. -Sweetheart. My dearâ€¦ Come, let's go home. Let's go home. Chinnadurai, come on. Let's go home. How can you leave us after doing so many good things for us? My dad is no more. So what? I have two uncles. I don't have just one mother. Including two of my aunts, I have three mothers. I have my grandparents, and paternal aunt and uncle. I have so many cousins. I have a big joint family. Even if you ask me to go away, where would I go without my family, Uncle? Chinnadurai! My childâ€¦ THANKS TO THE GURUCHAR FAMILY FROM KANNANTHANGUDI VILLAGE OF TANJORE DISTRICT WHO STOOD AGAINST MANY VILLAGES AND WON KABADDI MATCHES Hey, Chinnadurai. It's time ride the tractor! THANKS
