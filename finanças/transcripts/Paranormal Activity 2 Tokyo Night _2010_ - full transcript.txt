Nice. Ah, that's the switch. And here we have... ...my sister, Ms. Haruka Yamano, about to emerge from her carriage... ...returning from her travels in America. - Welcome home! - Thanks. So what's with the camera? Huh? Oh, I just bought it. Hey Koichi, erm, can you bring the wheelchair over here? - The wheelchair? - Yeah. How should I get out of here, dad? - From the back? - Don't worry. Thanks. - Ow, my leg! That hurt! - Whoa! Sorry sweetheart. - Is the lock on? Thanks. - Yeah. - What are you doing? - Do you have to shoot this? - Oh, would you look at this. - Cut it out Koichi, you should be doing this! - Are your legs OK, dad? - The loving father carrying his daughter. Whew! We have just celebrated the homecoming of Ms. Haruka Yamano... ...so I think we should ask her how everything's going. - Ms. Haruka Yamano? - Yes? Tell us how you're feeling about your current physical condition? It sucks. So, while I was travelling, I got into an accident. - I get all the luck, huh? - Absolutely. - Anyway, I fractured both my legs. They're killing me! - Yeah, looks painful. - This sucks! - If you keep saying it sucks, it really will. - What? So I should pretend like I'm having fun? - That's right. OK, I'm gonna use this red sea bream for dinner tonight. Alright, this is the fine cuisine I've prepared. I know, I'm a masterchef. Looking good. Whoa, the lens is clouding up! Tasty! Sometimes I think cooking is all you're cut out for. Totally. What do you mean, "that's all I'm cut out for"? Yeah, well, you should quit studying for this test and become a chef. If I'm a good cook then that's because of you and that job of yours. What do you mean? You're always working so someone has to do the cooking. - Are you going back to Singapore, dad? - Uh-huh. - Tomorrow morning. - Huh? Tomorrow? - Hard-going right? - Yeah. - How long for this time? - About twenty days. - How long for this time? - About twenty days. - That long? - Well, it's my job. - Oh, and Koichi, make sure you look after your sister properly. - Are you serious? - Well, I guess since no-one else is here... - Right. - You'll get used to it. What was that sigh for? Well, I'd rather not do it but I guess I have no choice. Seriously, Koichi? You think I want you having to look after me? We just have to deal with it. - But I can't move around so that's just the way it's going to have to be. Try and see it from my point of view - Right, OK - So, how long will it take? Until you can walk again? - How long? Hmm, about six months. Really? Nightmare. I can't believe I have to be like this for another half a year. Can't even go out when I want. - Well, you don't have anyone to hang out with anyway! - Yes I do! - I totally do. - You have no friends 'cause you work all the time. Ah, man... - This is lame. - Why? 'Cause I'm just filming you. I've got to start filming some scenery or something. Can I give it a try? Yeah, OK. Give it here... Whoa, it's heavy! OK. Is this being filmed? Sure is. Say something. This is Koichi. Yay! So what are you thinking? It's hot. What? Aren't you gonna do something else for me? Nope. - Why not? - Because. What? Are you ignoring me? Hey, tell me what you just told me. - Do you have to film this? - Does it matter? So, your wheelchair moved by itself? Yeah, last night... ...before I went to sleep, I could've sworn it was next to the bed... ...but when I got up this morning, it was over by the window. Whoa. Creepy. - And you didn't move it? - No, I was sleeping. Then how did it move? Do you think someone broke in? - What? No, you checked the door was locked, right? - Yeah, but what if they came in through the window or something? What? No way, absolutely not. Hmm, not sure. Looks pretty difficult to get in through here. See, impossible, right? Hmm. - What about through here? - I doubt it. Hmm. I guess you're right. Eh? Then how did it move? No idea. Ah! Got it! What? I know how it moved. - How? - Hmm, maybe. What are you doing? - Putting sea salt down for good luck. - Sea salt? - Why? - Because it's in your room. - What is? - Something that can't be seen with the naked eye. Stop it! Why are you trying to scare me like that?! - There we go. - This feels weird. Can't you get rid of it? - Hey! Get rid of it! I hate all this! - It's to protect you. - It'll protect you from all this craziness. It's fine. - You frighten me when you talk like that. - It'll be OK. - Please can you take it away? - It's not causing any problems. - How is it not? I don't like it. It's just salt. What's wrong? Whoa. What the hell? - Please tell me you did this, Koichi. - Wasn't me. Wow. - Seems like there's definitely something in here. - Enough already! I'm already freaked out! Fuck. - I'm telling you, there's something in your room. - And I'm telling you there isn't. It was just an accident. Then how do you explain all this crap with the salt and the wheelchair? - The wind... - Nah, the wind couldn't have done that to the salt. - Listen, sis, If you could watch what happened to the salt, would you watch it? - What do you mean, "watch"? - Would you want to watch it? - How could I see it? I'll show you after dinner. - What are you doing? - It's alright. Hang on a second. Huh? Is that my room? - You've got to be kidding. You put the camera in my room? Are you serious? - Yeah. It was bothering me. - It's not that bad. - Why didn't you say anything? You hid it? - Alright, but if I'd have said something, you wouldn't have let me film it. - Of course I wouldn't have let you! - I'm only filming this part of the room. - You're unbelievable! You never told me... - Why are you getting so angry? I just want to check out what's happened. - You suck! - Well, now we can see what's causing this. - Yeah well, curiosity killed the cat. I don't believe you. Now... - Aren't you gonna say sorry for this? Anytime now would be good. - Later, watch this. Just watch it. Apologize! Whoa. - Huh? - What? Let me see that again. Here. Wow. What was that? Is that salt moving? Whoa. Crazy. What are you up to? - Setting up the camera. - The camera? For what? Why? - Alright, done. - Whoa, hang on a second. You're setting up the camera? In my room? What are you doing with this? - Whoa, awesome picture quality, hey? - What have you done? - I've connected the camera to the PC. - This is my room, right? So, what's this for? - Well, in the unlikely event that something happens, I can come and save you. And what is this "unlikely event"? OK, for example, if some angry ghost starts trying to attack you... - Alright Koichi, I'm tired of you fooling around. - I can come... - Quit it! Quit it! - ...straight away and... - Just for one night. - Just for one night? - Definitely just one night? You promise? Definitely? - Yes! - Alright, I'll trust you. - OK - Everything normal? Alright, sleep well. - Goodnight. Later. So, tonight, we're going to film Haruka's room and see if any weird things start to happen. If there are, it'll probably be the discovery of the century... ...and at the same time, it'll make awesome viewing. Looks like I'm in for an all-nighter. - Nothing, see. - Yeah, nothing. - I told you there was nothing. Well, that's the end of you filming me! - So, Koichi, how do you like being on the other side of the camera? - Eh? I don't really care. - How about we put the camera in your room tonight? - Why? There's no point. - Why? - Because it's happening in your room, not mine. - But you know I hate camera's. - When did you get so camera-shy? What are you talking like that for? Well, It's not like I'm going overboard about this. - So, how about we film one last time? It's only a camera... Please? - No way! We might get something. Could make you famous! C'mon... - No! You promised! - Please! - OK, OK, if we do this one more time, then that'll be the end of it, yeah? - DEFINITELY the last time! - DEFINITELY right?! - I swear! C'mon, what do you say? - Well, you know I don't like it, but fine, whatever. - Wahey! - Nothing again. - No, no, there was something, watch. It's coming. Here! Can you hear that? Listen. - You heard that, right? - And what? It was just a sound. It wasn't "just" a sound. - That didn't sound natural to me. Listen. - It's just background noise. - No, no, it's like someone's knocking. - A knocking? - Yeah, like if there's a poltergeist or evil spirit that wants to show that it's angry, they make sounds to express their presence. That does it. I want you to swear right now that you'll stop all this nonsense! - I think we need to do it again. - No, it's done. say it! - The final time... - Say it, that you're not gonna film anymore! - Once more and I swear I won't do it again. - Forget it, Koichi. You promised me that was it! - But we've got this far... - Say it! - We're seriously close to getting this! C'mon, a little longer... - No! - Once more... - Say it! - Wow, you really are angry about this. One more time? - No! Alright, fine, I won't. - Really? - Yeah. - Never again? - Uh-huh. I won't film your room again. - Promise you won't? - I promise I... - Say it properly! - I promise I won't. - I mean it! Say it properly! - OK, OK, OK, I won't, I promise. - Remember, you promised. I've got it on camera. - I know, got it. - Enough with the face. - Oh, pleeeeease, c'mon! - Last time! - I'm warning you, Koichi - Man... - (sigh) - Why are you still filming? - Not even once more? - I said no! - No more after this... - I've told you already, no! Ahh, I give up. - If you keep worrying about this, aren't you gonna fall behind with your college work? - That's got nothing to do with this. - I think it does. I haven't seen you studying once since I got back. - Hey, I'm studying hard. - I don't believe you. - Well I am, you aren't the only one who's been busy. - Huh? - I'm looking after you, right? Then I have to cook and do the cleaning, which I never had to do before. And that's my fault? Yeah, partly. You know it's been difficult for me. The sooner you get that, the better. - Well excuse me. - What the hell... You're acting like a school kid. - I'm like a school kid? I told you to quit it, but you keep going on at me, and you call me childish? - Chill out, Haruka. - But you know how I feel about this. - Whatever. You're just taking it out on me. - No, I'm not. It's you that's working me up! - I'm not doing anything that should freak you out this much. - Yes you are! You won't stop going on about all this supernatural rubbish. You're driving me crazy! You're the one who came to me saying that your wheelchair moved by itself, - and then started screaming when the salt went everywhere. - I said it on camera once when you were shoving your camera in my face having fun! - Whoa, I'm not enjoying this. - You are! - I did it to try and find out what was causing this. - You're being a jerk! You're doing this for me? More like for yourself. - No, I'm not. - From now on just leave me alone! - Do what you want. - Yeah, I'd rather be in hospital than... - What... the hell... - I dunno. Just exploded. - Hey, what do you think happened with that glass? - Hmm, no idea. - Some strange stuff is happening, huh... - Yeah. - Well, it's been going on for a while. - A while? - Mhmm. - Anyway... - You can film, if you want. - Huh? - With the camera. You sure? I wanna know what's happening when I'm sleeping. - Mmm, alright. - Wahey! Long time no see! - Hey! - What's this? You just bought this? - Yep, brand new. - Serious? - Hey! - Hey guys! Come on in! - Thank you so much! Wow! - How are your legs? Getting better, thanks for asking! These are so cute! - So, nice to meet you, I'm Jun. - Hey, Jun! And this is Jun's girlfriend... - Hi, I'm Mai! Nice to meet you! - Nice to meet you, too! - And this is... - ...this is my friend, Misuzu. - Hey! Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. - We forgot to introduce ourselves before, huh? - Haha, yeah. Hey Koichi, you're up next. - Nah, it's okay. - Who are you then, sonny? - I'm Koichi. - And you are... - I'm Haruka. Hey! She's pretty, isn't she? - Yeah, there was a rumor going round that Koichi's sister was hot, and it's true! - You never told me, Koichi! Everyone used to talk about it. - But Koichi's never had a girlfriend since High School! - Really? I thought so! - No wonder you don't have a girlfriend when you see your beautiful sister everyday! - You're kidding, right? - How can you say that? Look at her! Oh, thanks! - Hey Jun, I'm right here, you know! - Ah sorry, Mai is the number one cutie here! - Stop fooling around now. - I'm not, I'm filming. - Misuzu? Did you see something? - Oh, umm... - I thought so. Seriously? - She's kind of got a supernatural sixth sense. - Really? - Well kind of... - ...I don't usually tell anyone but... - So how do you see them? In some kind of form or as a person? - Um yeah, sometimes as people... I see them in different forms though. So, when it's not in a human form, it's almost as if it's a white mist, or some kind of magnetic force. - They can take on very different forms. - So, is there something here now? - Yeah... I think so. - You feel it? - Yeah. Hey, erm, I've got something I'd like you to take a look at, is that OK? - Yeah. - Alright, shall we go upstairs? What are you showing her? - Let's go. - OK. Wow. - Play it again. - What was that? What the hell? - Hey, where was this filmed? - In my sister's room. I put the camera under the bed. Well? - Is there something here? - Misuzu? Is there anything here? What is it? Sorry, I'm not quite sure but... When did this all start happening? - When? About four or five days ago, right? - Yeah, I think so... Does it happen often? Yeah, usually at night. Hey, are you OK? What are you doing? What is it? What's wrong? Misuzu? Are you alright? What's wrong?! Get her a towel! Are you OK?! Do you need some water? - Do you need a drink? - I'm sorry. I have to get out of here. Sorry. -Where are you going? - Wait! What did you see? I'm really sorry. I have to go. - Wait! - Sorry, buddy. Ah hello, my name is Koichi Yamano. I came across your site on the internet and decided to give you a call. Yes, erm, we'd like you to perform a purification ceremony at our home if possible. Yes, well, it started fairly recently but we've been having some strange things happening, for example glasses smashing by themselves. Was that from downstairs? Hello? Who's there? Is anybody there? Hey! What the... What's going on? Hello? Is anyone there? God damn it. No way. What the hell is this? Look at my photo frames. Now strange stuff's started happening in my room, too. It doesn't feel safe here. Maybe we should leave. - Are you gonna film your room too? - Yeah, I think I should. What happened? It touched me! It touched me! - What did? - I don't know, I don't know! It's alright. There's no-one there. There was nothing there, I promise. We can't keep doing this, dad. It's not just a case of seeing ghosts. You have to get back here. It isn't safe for us to be by ourselves. Yeah... OK... See ya. - What did he say? - He'll be back in a few days. He said he thinks it's crazy to leave the house over this. - But he's coming back, right? - Uh-huh. Alright. One second! We are now ready to be begin the purification of this house. Let us pray. Slowly close your eyes. Let your shoulders unwind... ...and let your body fall into a total state of relaxation. Great Sun Goddess, Gods of the Heavens, God of War, Great Dragon God Lend us your divine grace... ...and cast out all evil entities from this place. Evil spirit, be gone from this house. Evil spirit, be gone from this house. Well, we have completed the purification ceremony. What happened to the spirit? Be at peace. It will trouble you no longer. - Does that mean our house is safe? - Yes. The evil that once was, has now disappeared forever. Thank you. - Has he gone? - Yeah, I just saw him off. OK. I wonder whether he's got rid of it. Well, he said we'd be alright now. - So, Ms. Haruka Yamano. - Yes? - It's been four days since the purification ceremony. Anything to report? - Hmmm, nope. Nothing special. - Great. Congratulations! - Thank you very much! - OK, I think we should ask Mr. Koichi Yamano to share his thoughts. - Yes. - So, tell us. Has anything strange happened since the purification ceremony? - Nope. Same as you. Nothing special. - Congratulations! - Thank you very much! - I guess this means that it worked. - Yeah. - Congratulations! - Congratulations! You've had it rough recently, eh? You break your legs in America, only to come back to find that your house is haunted! Sucks, huh? The worst! How come this all happened to me?! - Hey, is it true that the girl you hit in America was a killer? - Who told you that? - Dad. - Yeah. She murdered her boyfriend and then tried to escape. Seriously? - It's not your fault, you know. - I guess not. She just ran straight out in front of the car. Well, aren't you mad for having broken your legs because of someone like that? I'm not angry, Koichi. I feel terrible. She died, you know. The girl I hit. Yeah, I know. - Welcome home! Sorry dad. - I'm home. - Sorry for disturbing you from your work. - No problem. - Come on then, let's get you back inside. - Thanks dad. Whoa, careful of my feet! - You must be tired. - Yeah, a little. It's been crazy here while you've been away. - Yeah, it really has been, huh! - We had to get a priest here. - Really? - But since then nothing's happened, so it worked out I guess. Really? Ah, that's good to hear. - Careful. - Uh-huh. - So how are... huh? Go on, what's up? - When are... - When do you have to go back? - Tomorrow morning. Tomorrow? - When do you come back home again? - As soon as I'm done with this deal. - As soon as your done? - Just a little longer. - Sorry dad, for tearing you away from work. - Don't worry. - It's really good to have you home. I'm happy to be here. - Here ya go. - Thanks. What about me? God damn it. - What's up? - Umm, where's dad? - He said he had to leave this morning so he has probably already left. - I see. - What's up? - Look at this. - Is this the video from yesterday? - Uh-huh. It's moving. It's still here. You mean it's not over? No. - Oh hello, we had a priest of yours come to our house the other day to perform a purification ceremony? My name's Koichi Yamano by the way. What? Yes. When did this happen? Yes. I understand. Yes, goodbye. What happened? The priest is dead. What? When? Five days ago. After he left us... ...he had a heart attack. No way. What the... What's happening? Koichi! My hair! It hurts, it hurts, it hurts! What the? It's locked! Please! No! Shit! Let go, let go, let me go! All right, I'm here! Haruka! Calm down, it's me! - It's under the bed! - Under the bed? - Get rid of it, please! - There's nothing here. No-one's here. It's gone! It's alright. Calm down. Sis? Haruka? Haruka! It's not safe here. We need to get out of here. Dad's not picking up his phone. Now's not the time to worry about dad! It's always "work, work, work" with him. Forget about dad. We'll call him later. - We should tell him what's going on... - I said you don't need to worry about that right now. Just get your things together. What's wrong? I need to tell you something. What? I should have told you earlier but... Told me what? Strange things were happening when I was in the hospital in America, too. Even though there was no-one there, I heard footsteps, and things started moving by themselves. But I thought it had something to do with the hospital, not because of my accident. But now it's happening here. You serious? Yeah. - Can I use your computer? - Yeah. When I got back, I started looking up stuff on the internet, about the girl I hit in America. Her name was Katie. Before she killed her boyfriend, there was strange stuff happening with her too. What're you trying to say? This evil spirit... ...it's not just in our house. It's coming for me. Same as it did for her. Knock it off. Sometimes...I don't feel myself, like I'm another person almost. I feel as if I can't control my own actions. Listen to me. If anything happens to me, leave me and get out of here. - You know I couldn't do that. - Please. Get yourself out of this house. I'm so sorry. What for? For everything. This isn't like you. I know. Anyway, go and pack your things. OK? Haruka? Where are you? Where the hell is she? Sis? Sis? Where are you? Haruka? Haruka? Where is she? Sis? What are you doing out here? Hey! Haruka! Hey! Wake up! - Sister! - It bit me. It bit you? Where? - It bit me! - Where? Show me! It bit me! What did? What bit you? - It's here. - What is? It's here! - Where? - Behind you! Haruka! Hey! Wake up! Haruka! I said wake up! What the fuck? Sis? Are you OK? Can I get you something? I want some of my brother's fantastic cooking. OK, no problem. Hang on a second. Shit! Sis? Haruka! Haruka, where are you? Haruka! Oh fuck. Haruka! Where the hell is she? Haruka! Haruka. What? Dad? Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop! - Go! Go! - Where to? - Doesn't matter! Go! My God. Haruka. Haruka. Come in. Take your time.
