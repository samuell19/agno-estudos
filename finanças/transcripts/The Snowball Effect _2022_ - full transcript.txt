Good morning, Winterport. Hello and good morning Winterport. My name is Sam Perrish and this is your weather today. I am Tara Washington, here on the eve of our favorite season around. That's right, tomorrow is the 21st day of the month, the shortest day of the year, and the absolute official start of winter. Now let's go ahead and get right to it, "cause it is about to get real. A high of 40 today will give way to a high of 28. Now although they do look good together, today is definitely not blazer or hoodie weather, and I'd say that we are actually flirting with winter coat territory. See we have this big low pressure system down here and of course, we've been dealing with this high pressure system over here. And you are gonna wanna swipe right on those parkas! When those combine, the barometer goes south and the snow levels go... phew. We're talking big fluffy flakes, white rolling hills and an absolute total body workout when you finally roll out of bed to shovel. We're talking 30 to 50 inches of snow, sub-zero temperatures. Hold onto your hats. It is twice in a century occurrence. Stock up on bread, milk, and eggs. Where two smaller systems collide just right, and churn, and spin... Get out those sleds, "cause we're gonna have a white Christmas style system that we like to call... - "“The Snowball Effect."” - "“The Snowball Effect."” And we're clear! Great job, guys! Thank you. Great work. Thank you. Thank you. Good morning, Mia. Hey, Tara. That temperature graphic still felt a little late, right? Ah, I'm sorry. I will hit up the switcher and make sure he has the right cues. You're a rockstar. It's just my job. Gotta be tighter if we're gonna make it to number one. I know. We'll get there. How was the weather king this morning by the way? "“Sam Perrish, and this is your weather today."” Hm. Handsome as always. But his numbers were way off. Let's take a look, shall we? Last week timing was wrong 50%, precipitation 70%. And his temperature was missed on average of 6 degrees. Hmph. Why do his readings keep going up though? Ours do, too. Not as fast. Not as fast as his, Mia. Uh, right. Sorry. What? It's just what if we start thinking outside the box? What box? Stan Winston quits mid segment, walks off air in now viral moment. Mmhmm. What? What? I am a professional! I'm on the air right now! Are you kidding me? I've had it! That is enough. Oh my! Coffee? Yup. This is crazy. This has never happened. I just... I can't believe this. This is it, isn't it? This is it. This is my chance to move up. Yup. I could bring you as my editor. You gotta call. - I gotta call. - You gotta call. Not here. - Okay. - Okay. - I'll be right back. - Alright. Okay. Tara, this is it. Okay! Here we go. Hello? Hi, this is Tara Washington from Winterport Action News. Uh, I was calling, because I heard you might be looking to fill a position. Yeah, the meteorologist. Okay, great. Yup, Washington and yes, the number I'm calling from is perfect. Okay, great. Thanks. I am looking forward to hearing from them. Bye. Phew! Hey! Oh no, it's... It is all good, it was a short hold. Yes, this is uh, Sam Perrish, calling about the recent meteorologist opening. Yup. Oh, not your first call, huh? I bet. Okay. Yup. Sam Perrish. As in like, the Sam Perrish? Yes! The Sam Perrish! Of course, he would. Of course. Are you worried? No. No. Good. Good. - Should I be? - No. No. Look at me, okay. Sam Perrish is like 100% Winterport, okay. He was born here, raised here and he's a weatherman here. You are going to be so much bigger. I've been battling him on his own turf for five years now. - But it's your turn now. - Absolutely. No one works as hard as you. And look at me, no one is as nearly as accurate. Okay? Okay. Yeah. That's what they want, right? Right. So what is it, like an interview or something? I don't know. They'll get back to me with the details. I hope soon. Okay. Well, we'll figure it out. Alright. So, Christmas... Now, is your flight still leaving on Christmas Eve? It is. Nice. Are you nervous? I am. I hope it goes okay. I haven't seen my parents in three years. Yeah. I have somehow convinced all of my nieces that I'm one of Santa's elves and that explains where I've been all these years. But at least we're loved. Oh wow, more? Yeah. I don't know any of these people. It's okay. They love you. Thanks, Norm. Alright, we're gonna take a short break. And when we get back, we'll have a look at that snowball effect system from our chief meteorologist, Tara Washington. Well, maybe for now, we just focus on the storm of the century barreling towards us. Merry Christmas. Hello? Miss Tara Washington? Yes. Ron Mitchum, Northeast News. Oh. Oh! I presume, I didn't wake you. Ah, no. Of course not. Every meteorologist is awake at... 2:40 in the morning. Great. I like to know I can get a hold of my potential hires any time of the day. Yes. Of course, Ron, uh, Mr. Mitchum. No, no, Ron is fine. I looked you up. And I like your style. We're holding interviews tomorrow. I know with the storm and all it could be tricky, but we need to know we can count on whoever we go with. Tomorrow? Wow. Uh, yeah. Of course, that makes sense. How's 6:00 p.m.? Can you be in Boston by 6:00? Uh, 6:00 p.m. I uh... Well, Tara, there's a big gap in my lineup I'm eager to fill as fast as possible. Definitely. Yes, um, absolutely. I'll be there. Great. Competition's stiff, but I have a good feeling about you. Great. Yes, sir. I... I won't let you down. I promise. Hello? Hello... 2:40 in the morning. Uh, what are you doing here? Mia, hey, glad you're here early. This is the time I start every day. Oh. So, what's up? I have to get to Boston, tonight. Okay. For the interview. Planes and trains are either booked or cancelled, because of the blizzard. So... So, I'm mapping out the trajectory of the storm, the likely start times for the heavy stuff, the likely road closures. You're driving. I'm gonna have to. Look, if I can take this road here north, then I can skirt right around the edge just before it all settles. You would use meteorology to solve this. Ah, I feel like it's a test. Pass it and the job is mine. I can feel it. Well, here. This will help. You're the best. Still my job. Joy to the world... Rerouting. Turn right ahead. Wait, what? Turn right ahead. What? Uh, a right? Shoot! Okay. Rerouting. Why are we rerouting? Road closed ahead. - What? - Road closed ahead. Why are you closing highways already? We've at least an hour before the storm. Come on! Rerouting. Road closed ahead. No. Road closed ahead. No! Stop! Take next left, then right onto country road 7. I don't care. I'm taking this road. Rerouting. You're not doing this to me. Well, what now? Signal lost. Please return to service area. Ahhh! What? No... Not now. Afternoon, ma'am. Governor closed the roads. Look, officer the storm won't be here for another 20 minutes. If you could just let me through, I promise I can make it. No, can't do. Please sir, I'm an expert. On driving? No, on storms. I'm a meteorologist. Okay. Alright, alright. Alright? There's an inn, a couple of miles down the road, Mistletoe. No, no, I... I really need to make it through. You can hold up there until this thing passes. Please? Sorry. Merry Christmas. Hi, excuse me... Hey. Oh, it's you. It is. Have we met before? "“Sam Perrish. And this is your weather today."” Oh, you're a fan. I like to keep my eye on the competition. Oh, I see it now. "“Tara Washington, Winterport Action News."” And you're trying to get to Boston? Eh. What, you going for the same gig, huh? Northeast News? I was. Well, isn't this somethin'? Stuck at an inn for the storm of the century. You think they're even open? Hi. Can I help you? Hi! Um, we're... Hey. We were um, looking for a place to stay. You know, just to ride out the storm. Okay. We were hoping that... That you had vacancy. Right now? Uh, yeah. I'm not really set up for guests right now. Um, this is my off season. Oh. Uh... Isn't this place called, "“Mistletoe" ”? It is. Okay. Well um, do you have any recommendations or... Hmm. Storm's supposed to be starting pretty soon. Any minute now. Well, you're in luck. I do always keep the loft set up. Just in case. A loft. That sounds great. It's quite cozy especially for a young couple such as yourselves. - Oh no, no! - Oh? Us? - We're not a couple. - No, we are not a couple. We came here in two different cars. We'd need two separate rooms. Well, it's only the one space with the one bed. I see. There's a couch. A couch. Yes. Separated by a door from the bedroom. That's not so bad. You could take the couch. No, it's fine. I... I can stay at another inn. There is not another inn for at least 20 miles out. That's... That's fine. I'll... I'll take my chances. Just one second. Uh, look. I don't like it either, but they've declared a state of emergency. It hasn't even started yet. But it's gonna start like... Right now. Alright. Let's go ahead and check out that loft. Okay. Okay. Here's everything you need. Make yourselves comfortable. I'll bring you dinner later and breakfast in the morning. Not sure what time yet, I was not expecting company. Oh, that's fine. We appreciate it. My name is Olivia. And I'm right next door if you need anything else. Thank you, Miss Olivia. Well, she's nice. Where are the decorations though? I don't know, but I 100% expect a visit from the ghosts of Christmas present, past, and future tonight. I don't know. I think it's very... What, rustic? Charming. I mean of course, you would say that. You getting the bed. It's a pretty comfy-looking couch. I mean, we can switch if you want. Oh no, I insist. Someone like you deserves the fine touch of polyester as they sleep. Oh, I cannot wait. Thank you. Oh, welcome back. You got service? Not yet. But if there is any, I will find it. And persistent. You could help. Ah, looks like you've got it handled. Do you not care about this job? Of course, I care about it but you know, you ain't got no service. What can you do? Try. Hey, hey, hey, I respect the hustle. I wonder if... Oh, I got something. What? Service. But it gets only up here. Hey there Tara, what... What's the story? Ron, hi! You on the road? Um, well, see that's the thing. Of course not. I saw that they closed it all down. That's unfortunate. Yeah, so I'm kinda trapped. Trapped? Where? In a town called, "“Mistletoe" ”. Mistletoe. Well, that's quite a predicament. I wonder if Sam Perrish will be so unfortunate. You... You were two of my top choices. Hey Mr. Mitchum, I'm actually stuck here, too. Sam Perrish! Well, I'll be. Yeah, we would have beat the storm if they would have let us through, but you know, very sorry about that. Well, you two can relax, you're still in the running. But with all the candidates I've interviewed, it wouldn't be fair to not judge you on a similar plain. We could do a video thing. Like a virtual interview? No, no. I need something bigger. How about... how about this? I'm... I'm not gonna be making my... Your own weather news package. Something that shows me that you both understand weather, but more importantly that you can make people care about it, too. Okay. What sort of format would you be looking for? An evergreen? A quick report? Four-minute slot? Two-minute slot? Uh... Mr. Mitchum? Hello? Ron? Sam, you got that, too? You have three days. Yes, sir. Absolutely. Three days. Okay, great. I... I won't let you down. Hello? Well, so much for Christmas. Three days. Wow. Write, shoot, and edit a package with, what, no crew? No equipment, no research? And we won't get out of here for what, another day or two? Which means Christmas Eve is the only day to put it together. You always just stare at people silently? I do. It's this habit I have called "“thinking" ”. Oh. Oh, okay. Yeah, yeah. No, yeah. I can do it somewhere else if you prefer. Oh no. Oh no, you good. You good. I mean you did find us service, so you know, props for that. Well, not everyone gives up so easily. Wow. Okay, I see how it is. Good. It's uh, getting pretty late. It's not even 6:00. Yeah, you know, long day. You going to bed for real? Wow. Great. Interesting. Okay. Alright, that could work. Sam? Hey. What are you doing? Nothing. Alright, look, check out all of this stuff. Okay. Do I look like the uh, the ghost of Christmas past? More like the nightmare of Christmas present. Okay, Scrooge. Is this really all Christmas stuff? Yeah, there's so much stuff in here. Like suspiciously so much stuff. But why? I don't know. Apparently, Miss Olivia is a closet Christmas-holic. Why closet? I mean, why not set all of this up? Right. And like you said, what is a place called the "“Mistletoe Inn"” doing not open during winter? I mean, I guess it's not easy to get to, but still... Anyway, do you mind keeping your Yuletide role play down to a minimum? Some of us actually care about this job and have a lot of work to do. You don't think I'm down here working? Goodnight. I'm working, Tara. I'm just saying. Goodnight. Okay. Oh, hey. Good morning. Morning. Hope you slept well. Definitely. The storm's not letting up. No, ma'am. Not for a while. Sometime this afternoon. Oh, is that a fact? 2:20 in the afternoon to be exact. Hmm. What are you some kind of weather person? Yeah. We both are actually. I'm Sam Perrish, News Channel 6. And she is Tara Washington. Winterport Action news. Okay. A couple of celebrities. Oh, no. Not really. I wouldn't say that. Well, here's your breakfast. Enjoy. Ah, I had a question. Yes, dear. We noticed in the basement last night that it's full of Christmas decorations. Uh, you were in my basement? Yeah. Sorry the stairs were open. Those... Those were the decorations for the old winter festival Mistletoe used to hold each year. In fact, my husband made most of those. That's why I keep them down there. Uh, Miss Olivia, is he... Hm. Yeah, about ten years now. Sorry to hear that. Well, no festival, no decorations. I just don't have the heart to throw "em out. What happened to the festival? It soured on us. How? Times change, I guess. Anyway... I mean we can help set some things up. You know, if you want a little Christmas flair around here. Or even just some lights inside? No. That's okay, thank you. Enjoy your breakfast. Hey, so I guess, don't mention Christmas around Miss Olivia. Yeah. Really. I wonder what the deal is. Uh, something wrong? Oh just... Just my favorite. Oh, um... Well... They're my favorite, too. Thank you. Tis' the season, I guess. Yup, just not in Mistletoe. Yeah. What? Nothing. I'm just gonna start working. What'd I say this time? It's nothing really. And there she goes, across the room again. I'd say there's about a 95% chance of a closed door in the next five seconds and... Um, there you have it. Mia, I need your help. Hey, Tara. What's up? Northeast News wants me to do a mock segment instead of the interview, but I'm stuck, so I gotta do it here. In Mistletoe. Uh, okay. Looking into Mistletoe now. And Sam is here, too. What? And he has to do a report, too, but I think he's waiting to get back to Winterport to do it, so we can get a jump on him. Okay. Um, what do we... What do we need? Information. Uh, something we can build both a weather and a human interest piece around. Okay. Um, do you have any starting points? Saving Christmas. Does it need saving? It does here. The inn keeper was saying that there used to be this huge festival every year and how it's nonexistent. I mean, she was getting all worked up when we asked her about it. And... Okay. Just, just... I am looking into the Mistletoe festival. Yes. My service is terrible. And I don't have Wi-FI, but I need to figure out what happened to Christmas and how I can use the storm to bring it back. Ah, will do. Thanks. Alright. Ah, keep me posted. Um, so how much time do we have? Oh, she's back. Snow's letting up. Yeah, it is. You exploring? Could use a change of venue. You know what? Sounds like a good idea. You doing the same? I hope that's okay. As long as you're not a distraction. It's true what they say. What? I just heard that you never really turn it off. Well, you don't become the most accurate meteorologist by accident. Oh, you know what you really need if you're going into town? What, company? Well, yeah. But no. A pair of these. Okay. Oh. No, it is never too late. See? What you gotta do is grease your speedy up. You see, go like this. Okay. Now, you kids have fun. Hey, and if you get hurt, it's not my fault. Hey. Hey, you get my text? Uh-huh. That's what I found out at the library, too. I don't suppose you're gonna be able to get that train service back in time for Christmas. Ha, yeah. No way. Any other ideas? You know, hear me out, I think the mayor might be our in. Huh, okay? Well, after the festival flopped, she asked everyone to take a pause on Christmas. They did that year and then, I guess every year since. Oh, that's really strange. Like why just stop celebrating altogether? I don't know. Let's um, let's dig deeper on the mayor and see if there's anything that we can use. Got it. Hey, I gotta go. Let me know what you find. Sure, but when do you need it by? As soon as you can. Hey miss, what can I get for you? Um, hi. Uh, water and a chicken Caesar? Decisive, I like it. Hey um, you seem pretty friendly with that guy over there? Who, Sam? You're not gonna believe this but he is actually a weatherman, down in Winterport. Wow, unbelievable. Really nice guy. Super relate-able for being so famous. Hm, is he that famous though? Well, he's the number one rated reporter in the whole town. I'm sure he told you that. Um so, what else did you talk about? Well, um, Christmas. Really, Christmas? What about it? Uh, hang on. Hey Sam! Oh, I... See we're on a first-name basis. Yeah, what were you saying about the Christmas and the report and everything? I think she might be a fan. Oh, Rueben, my man. This is Tara. Oh, so you two know each other. Oh yeah. She is apparently the most accurate meteorologist in all of Winterport. No. Mmhmm. You're... you're joking now. No. He's joking. No, no. Not at all. I mean, we got stuck heading for the same job interview. Oh my. So ah, Rueben was it? It was and is. So, tell me um, were you all talking about Christmas in Mistletoe? Or maybe the lack thereof. Yeah, I was telling about how I miss the lights, and the decorations, and stuff. Yeah. So, they had this train that would go through town. And everyone winter, they'd have this huge festival. Yup. And I used to run a micro-brew booth at it. But then the train stopped. So did the fes... The festival. I know, I heard that, too. It was really rough actually. I... I had to give away so much free beer that year, it flopped. But I was actually kinda lucky. Some businesses totally shut down. What so now people just don't celebrate? A little. And just a lot of raw feelings out there, so we keep it real low key. So, you don't put up any twinkle lights or anything? Yeah, I have a business to run. I mean, the last thing I need is to offend. Don't you think after three years... Ah well, let somebody else start that trend. I mean for now, even with the business being steady, we are barely hanging on. What about a party though? I'm serious like instead of outside, you do something inside, so no one has to see. Just the people that want to be there. So speakeasy Christmas. Sounds a little sketchy. I'd be in. Do you think a lot of people would be? Hard to tell. I mean most people, they don't really talk about it much. You know what, maybe they should. Yeah. Oh hey, you know, do you guys need anything else? I gotta go check on the other tables. Oh, of course. No, no, we're all good. Okay. Miss, here? Oh. Yeah, I'm fine. Good. Actually um, can you make that to go? Uh, sure thing. Thanks. - Rueben, my boy. - Man... Two reporters... This is great! Yeah, he's fun. Oh, something come up? Hm, just a lot of work ahead. Oh, of course. And I just promised... I just... I just said I wouldn't distract. Mmhmm. - And here I am. - Mmhmm. - Distract... I'm still... - Mmhmm. - Okay. - Alright. Ugh. Mia, hey. Hey Tara, did you see what I found? Yes, tell me more. Well, her name came up on the community directory. Looks like the mayor was the local choir teacher for 25 years. That's brilliant. It is? This is our in! How? Music, Mia. Music is powerful. Uh, okay. So, what are you gonna do? I have an idea. Good. So, that's all you need? For now, yes. I'm gonna start recording some stand-ups and can I send those over to you, so you can start editing the package? - Uh, you want... - You want me to edit it? Uh, sure. Sure. You're the best, right? Of course. The game is changing. I think he's gonna do his own report here now, too. Oh really? Yeah. He's so... I don't know, I can't... I can't figure him out. But either way, we just need to focus. Yes! And do not let his looks lure you in, alright? Mia! Anyway, I'll get you the story, you pump out something golden, and we'll ride this wave all the way to Boston. No distractions. Mia? Ah, yes. Absolutely. What are you doing anyways? Uh, uh, nothing. Um, just send me the videos when they're ready. Okay. They'll be there soon. Thanks. Hey do you have a printer I can use? Yeah, we do. We do. It's right over here. But you can actually print from your phone in here. Really? Yeah. Ooh, fancy. Can you show me how to... Sure. Should be all set now. Wow, that's good. - Alright. - Okay. - Be right back. - Yeah, sure. Thank you. Okay. - You all set? - Yes, ma'am. You should come. Okay. Thank you. - Yes, ma'am. - Have a good day. Thank you, too. This is Tara Washington reporting from the Inn at Mistletoe Massachusetts. Five years ago, this was a source of one of the state's favorite Christmas traditions; the winter express train. Which brought in throngs of tourists to the perfectly-named town to bask in its seasonal revelry, and more importantly, spend their year-end bonuses on a financially-strapped population. But eventually, the sun set on the train service, and in turn it dimmed the town's very financial survival. The question is, can a once in a lifetime blizzard create its own snowball effect on the locals, and inspire a new Christmas renaissance? I'm here to find out. Yeah, exactly, so you can understand why it's pressing. But don't you think Mistletoe is due... I agree. Of course. But just... Just give it a shot. Ask around, that's all I'm saying. Anyone willing, just have them meet me at the mayor's house. 7:00 p.m. Okay, yes, um, please, just see what you can do. Okay. Ah, thank you. Bye. This has been the most wonderful Christmas. Oh yes, you've given us enough already. How's it going? It's a cute town you know. Hmm. Good people. It is. You go shopping for new clothes? No, I packed these. It's not like I was gonna drive back after the interview with a blizzard coming through. Yeah. Yup, yup. Did you not pack anything? You know. I didn't think that far ahead, so... Winterport's number one forecaster here. Hmm? Nothing. Hm, email? Uh, yes. Just wait. Consider it my RSVP. I just thought the town could use it. Uh-huh. Also seems like it would make a great report. Hmm. Did you find a venue? Oh yeah. They got this... This big ballroom down at the square. Food, drinks, you got decorations? Yeah. It's coming. Music? Entertainment? - Activities? - Activities? Activities, this is good. This is good. Did you not think of any of these things? Seems like you keep doing the figuring out for me. Yeah. I gotta stop doing that. Maybe, you need a break. What I need is more time. We'll be fine. Are you watching a Christmas movie? It's a guilty pleasure, alright. Unbelievable. Look, why don't you just take a second. You know, just sit down, relax. Yeah, that sounds very nice, but like I said. Like you said, not enough time. But what can you do tonight? I can... And it's... It's not I'll be working ahead. Truce for now? Come on. Look, Olivia brought cookies. And they smell good. And I brought these. Half of them don't work, but yeah... Ah... Okay. Hey, stop, don't. Don't eat it all if you don't get some more. Looks like someone's out. Hey? Hm. Let's go to bed. Alright, come on. Time for bed, let's go, let's go. I want the bed. Come on. Come on. Watch your step. That's really nice. Thanks. Tara? Do you ever rest? What? Are you kidding me? - I'm a professional! - Unreal, wow. I'm on the air right now. - Well, hello there. - Rueben! Hey! My man, aren't we looking festive? We are. You like it? I love it. I mean, change of heart? Yeah. It's just all that talk about Christmas got me thinking, hey, you know, let's test the waters a little bit. Dude, this looks great. Oh, and I... I saw your flyers. Ooh, my flyers! Mmhmm. What you think? It's not very underground when everyone knows about it. But, you know what, I'm totally cool with it. So, you think you'll come? Oh yeah, man, of course. Yo, where you thinking about having it? Um, I was thinking the ballroom in the square. Okay. Once I figure out who to talk to about it. Oh. Well, you know, um, I'm actually the custodian there. Really? Yeah. Oh. You wanna check it out after the lunch rush. Absolutely. Alright. It's a date, man. What's that? I found my in for the ballroom. Oh. Congrats. Now you just gotta get some people. He's got at least one. Hey, pooh. Two, if I show up. - Ooh. - Oh. I mean, we are gonna go check it out after this, if you want to join. Yeah. I think I'm gonna be busy enough with my own report. Thank you. Open invite. Thanks. Just consider? Considering. What's the special? - Yeah. - Yeah. - Coming right up, bingo. - Yes. - Hi. - Hi. I'm doing a news report and I just wanted to know if you had any Christmas decorations that I can put up for a behind the video? Uh, I don't know if we have any. Just anything small. I could put it up on the door. I'll take it right down. Tell you what. I'll take a look and see if I can find something. Thank you. Christmas is only three days away. And while the town of Mistletoe is still decidedly underdressed for the occasion, there are signs that the blizzard may be creating its own snowball effect in town. Behind me, the local library, just yesterday without a hint of Christmas flavor, now sprouting the first signs of a renewed holiday spirit. All it took was a little push, and this little ball of yuletide is on the move. But can it collect enough energy along the way? We might have a few tricks up our sleeves to help it along. Okay. Christmas is only three days away. And while the town of Mistletoe is still decidedly under... Oh, come on! Really. Just in three minutes. Whoa, this is huge! Hell, we used to need it. You know, during the festivals and all. This is perfect. Yeah! I mean, although we're gonna need a lot of people if we want to fill this up. Well, there is a sound system over there. In case you want some seasonal tunes. Oh. Any decorations? Not really. Most people bring their own. Hmm. Have to figure that out. Hey, look who made it. Hey. What do you think? It's uh... It's gorgeous. Oh, and they got a sound system, too. So, how much is this going to cost you? You know, we actually haven't covered that yet. Cost? I don't really know. The owner hasn't been around for years, so we just use it how we want it and leave it how we found it. Oh, that's fortunate. You just make it look easy, don't you? Hey, so I gotta get back to my dinner rush. Do you two mind if you could lock up? Oh, no problem. Great. Enjoy and good seeing you again, miss. Nice to see you too, Rueben. I love you, Rueben. Thank you. Oh. It's nice, huh? It's nice. It's... it's really nice. You doing okay? Yeah, well. You know, not all of us can have solutions to our problems dropped into our laps. Some of us actually have to work for them. Okay. What? Here. Ah, what are you doing? What is your favorite Christmas song? What? They're way too many. You're right. Pick one. Sam, I'm fine. - I just... - Okay. We'll do a mix. Sam, I really should get back to work. I bet. Oh boy. I mean, you dance right? Nope. Everybody dances. Not me. My lady. Fine. You started it. Oh please. Ooh. Mmm, see there we go. - Okay. - Oh. The little neck and the mm, mm, mm. Okay. I don't figure how this helps. Oh, okay. So, now I do this with my crew when we're all feeling a little burnt out. Turn on some music. Ten minute dance break. Wait, so you have a soul-crushing deadline and you stop working and dance? We do. Does it help? Not always. Oh my goodness. So then what? Oh, I mean we take another ten. And ten more. Till we get our groove back. Oh boy. Hmph hmph. Here we go, give me some hip. That sounds like a lot of waste of time. No. I disagree. Of course, you do. Here we go. Hmm. What do you love most about Christmas? I... I don't know. Take your time. I mean, I love everything about Christmas. But... But? But I don't know, does it seem like every year it just gets a little less? Like something's missing. Like what? Like when I was a kid, Christmas used to be this huge deal. Wooh. Yeah, like that. And December felt like it lasted forever. And now the stores change even as early as September, and I still feel like I don't have enough time to fully get into it. Oh, you know, the amount of time that we have never changes. It's hust how you use it. Hmm. Oh. I just... I don't even... I don't even send Christmas cards anymore. And so that means I don't get any either. Just the ones at the station from a bunch of folks I don't know. It sounds like you need a lot more dance breaks. Or a life outside of work. Dance lessons? Oh. I'll teach you. No. Just feels like if I let up for just one second, I just fall behind. Well, you need support, you know, a team. I have a team. And I don't know that we can work any harder. Do you ever think that might be the problem? I'm sorry. Okay. Okay. I sound like a spoiled kid, right? I should just be happy. You're good. How do you feel? Still little stressed. Less stressed? Hm, a little bit. Okay. You know what, second favorite Christmas song. Ha. Nice try. Come on, what... What's the hurry? Trying to save Christmas. Don't wanna be late. Oh. Good luck. Thank you. Um, hi everyone. Thank you all for coming. This town has been without Christmas for the past two years now. And this is our chance to show the mayor that we're ready to celebrate again. So, get your candles turned on, which you already have. Some of you put on your game faces. And yeah, let's really hit those notes.

Nothing? Hey. Looking at all this Christmas that Reuben brought. Hey. What's up? Third favorite Christmas song? I think you won. Won? My story. It made perfect sense. It was perfect. I... I did all the research, I put it all together. She was just supposed to come out. Hey, hey. Alright, just take me back to the beginning. The mayor. It was supposed to be like the storm. She was the snowball. She puts up some decorations and then other people see her and follow her lead. And then pretty soon, the whole town is bursting with Christmas spirit. She's just a Grinch, no? Exactly! So, if you win over the Grinch, you win over the town. But you didn't win her over. That was my whole story. I have to... Have to figure this out. Hey, you just need to take a moment. Relax. Just breathe, regroup. No! Sam, no. I don't need to take a moment. I need to work. Harder than before. You ever think you might be working so hard, because you're working against yourself? What are you talking about? Everything I do is to push myself forward. Okay. But that doesn't mean you can't get in your own way. Okay. Alright, yeah. Maybe I could just sit around doing nothing and wait for someone to drop this into my lap. Sit around and do nothing? I worked for this. Now I just don't stress like you do. Okay, alright. Why don't you tell me about working too hard when you're the most accurate forecaster in Winterport. That's fine, but what has it gotten you? You're right. It got me number two, behind you. Hey Tara, wait! Hey, hey, hey, listen to me, listen to me. Look, I'm sorry. Don't want it. Look, I'm just worried that three years from now, that's gonna be you. Rage quitting in a viral video. Just like Stan, whatever his name is, who's job that you're trying to fill. Like that is what happens when you burn out. You don't know anything about me. Tara? We gotta start from scratch. What happened? I messed up. I was wrong. What do we gotta do? We can work through the night. We gotta... Did I wake you up? Uh, no. No, no, I'm good. Just let get to it, right. We gotta get this job, no matter what. Exactly. So uh, what now? I don't know, I... Tara? I... I... Hello? What is it? I think I did it. Did what? Mia. Don't lie. Did I wake you up? No. No, I was just... just getting a little bit of rest. Sleep. We'll do this tomorrow. Okay. Thank you. Sam? Oh, it's Rueben. It's looking really good in here, man. Um, don't wanna make this awkward, but do you need any change of clothes? Ah, no, it is just, poor planning. Ah. I guess me and the ballroom both running a little low on decorations, huh. Well, you know something, you're actually in luck, "cause... Good morning, hun. You weren't in the loft, and I didn't want this to go to waste. You made this just for me? Well, maybe I wanted to see what this event was all about, too. Yeah, I'm trying. Not a bad start. But you know, I have some things specifically made for this space. I know it must have been hard to think about putting those up after the festival bombed. Hard to think about? No! What was hard was when the mayor said that my husband's beautiful decorations would somehow upset people. I've wanted nothing more than another chance to show off his work. Tara? Hey. Well, okay, Rueben. Christmas is coming back! There's plenty more. Absolutely. So, what do I say? Um, you could start with... You're welcome. Umm... You're welcome? You're welcome. Yeah. You were right. I just literally slept 10 hours, and when I opened my eyes, it all made sense. That's great. But what made sense? Giving things time and space to fix themselves. I don't have to do everything. I'm pretty sure you could do everything. But that wouldn't be healthy. No one spends as much time on every predictive model and forecast as me. No one is as spot on with their reports as me. But people watch you, because you know how to make them understand it all. But you are a weather prodigy. Like I would give anything to have that. Do you know the kind of letters that I get when I miss a rain prediction? "I didn't bring my umbrella, because you said... " But you're still, hmm, pretty good. And people still kind of watch you. Well, see that's the point. That's what I realized this morning about both our reports. You have an event. And I still do not know... Know who is going to show up for it? But that's what I've been working on. Don't you see? The Mayor. She's a small, firm ball of snow. Oh. Yeah, you really lost me. You just get this space ready. Let me handle the guests. Okay. So, does this mean that we're not competing anymore? This is so much bigger than that now. We can still both do our own reports but in the end, working together is the better story and we get to save Christmas. Yeah. You know we make a pretty good team. Yeah. Just don't get too used to that. Right, Mia? Hey, what... What are you doing here? I found this. But... but the roads. State of emergency lifted. Okay, but why? Because you and I are a team. Wow. We really are, aren't we? And after trying to put together this massive surprise Christmas party for all of my nieces after being absent for the last four years. Oh no, Mia, I don't want to disrupt that. It's okay. I somehow convinced them that Mistletoe is actually a cover up for the north pole. They're coming tonight. That's good. I'm Sam, by the way. - Oh hi. - Hey. His. - By the way, this is Sam. - Yeah. It is. So, what are you guys doing? You two working together now? Yeah. Huh. Okay. Okay, great. We need to finish this report if you're gonna have a shot at this job. Right. Okay, uh, gotta go. Should we regroup in the afternoon? Yeah. Sounds good. Okay. Uh Tara, I will be right out. Okay. Okay. - Hey. - Hey. Who's editing your report? "Cause I have an idea. Don't be nervous. It's gotta be fine. Yeah. - You nervous? - I'm fine. Oh. Okay. I just have to convince the Mayor that the town is ready for Christmas again. Okay. I'll meet you back at the ballroom. Okay. But, you were spending this year with your nieces, because I was gonna be gone, right? Because you'd finally have a break at Christmas from all the work I give you. Look, if there's one thing that I've learned in this past year is that I can handle both at the same time. Okay. It's gonna be different, I promise. Okay. - Good luck. - Yeah. Ooh, hi. I saw you milling around outside. Oh. You brought the carolers? I did. Okay then. Come in. I'm going to tell you something that will probably come as a surprise to you, I don't hate Christmas. That's good. In fact, I love it. Always have. And as you correctly surmised, I love Christmas music most of all. You really got me with that, brought me back to Sunday lessons. Tears may have been shed. I... I'm so sorry. I was just... I know what you're doing, and I know what you're here for, so let's get to it. Well, the town could really use a Christmas boost. And I think they're ready to start celebrating again. And there's this party... And you're some sort of expert on our little town of Mistletoe, are you? No. No, I... You see these? They're beautiful. I used to get a new one every year at Christmas. See, Christmas is like a snow globe. A little different each year, yet still this perfect snapshot of how you dream it could be. That's beautiful. I'm sure you heard about the train service. Hmm. That left us in a real lurch. The town struggled every year and Christmas was the only bright spot. Nobody thought the festival was a good idea without the train, but I pushed because well, we needed it. What could we lose? Turns out everything. I just... You've seen the town. This snow has really brought out their holiday spirit. It has. I'll tell you what. I'll make an announcement. Tell the town about the party, and that it's a city sanctioned event. Is that what you want? That's... That's exactly what I want. We can see what people think. Will you come, too? It's an open invite. Hm, have fun tonight. And if I don't see you... Thank you. Ah... I uh, thank you. Thank you so much. Okay. Hey, it's all good. - I got your clothes, man. - My man. Can you actually move that way? Like two steps. - My way? - Yeah. - Your left, right? - Uh... that's cool. We'll... we'll live with it. Cool. Thank you, Rueben. Dude... Knock 'em dead. A white winter landscape, cooling a simmering tension that's been keeping a shared community Christmas spirit at bay. The gauge reads 33 inches, but it's hard for a number to really capture the emotions that come with it. Neighbors and friends, long divided, are now coming together for a sight unseen here in the past two years. Tonight, under a clear, brisk 15 degree sky, the winds will be calm, making for a perfectly still landscape like a snapshot, a memory of the way we want Christmas to be... Where old, young, and everything in between can come together and remember the joy that this time of year can bring. And with a little luck, and a lot of love... This week's historical blizzard will be the perfect storm, in the perfect season... For the perfect holiday town of Mistletoe. Hello, Ron. Hi, this is Mia from Winterport. I'm good, I'm good. Listen, I'm out in Mistletoe. I'm editing a package for Tara Washington and Sam Parrish. Yes, of course. Where would you like me to upload? Well? It's in. Thank you. Do you wanna see it? - No. - Really? I think you're gonna be impressed. Definitely not. I'm just gonna find all the things I hate about it, and that'll stress me out. Fine. Suit yourself. So, I take it you're not making your flight tonight? Oh no, my parents. Okay, it's okay. I let them know. I know you've been busy. I don't deserve you. I know. Oh. Okay. You taught me hard work pays, so... Okay. But we've paid our dues, right? Yeah. - You know, yeah, I think so. - Yeah. No more missed Christmases. No. No more. Starting today. Ah, I'll take this... It's okay. I gotta call my folks. I'm sure they're not happy. I think they'll understand. Especially if you get this job. Yeah. - You look great. - You too. - See you later. - Okay. Hello. - Hey. - Hi. How's it going? It's a start. People will come, I'm sure. Yeah. Ah, you heard from Northeast News? No. I've been trying not to think about that. Hmm. How about you? Feeling optimistic. Yeah. Hey, now we're talking! Rueben! Weather folks! Merry Christmas! Rueben, come here, man! Come here! Tara. - Merry Christmas, Rueben. - You look wow. Thank you. You brought people. You know my phone is just blowing up right now. Oh, I got kegs coming along the way. - What? - You're mad. Thank you two so much. I mean, it looks as good as it ever did. My husband would be so happy. Thank you. Thank you. This is... There's some... what's her name? Oh so, got something for you. What? I would have sent it, but I thought you wouldn't mind hand-delivered this year. Is this... Yup. Just for you. Oh. Well, you don't need to all stop on my account. This place have a mic set up? Yes, ma'am. Oh, me, okay. - Thank you. - Yes, ma'am. Ah, hi. Looks like we all have the same idea. Just needed someone to come out and say it. It's time for us to have Christmas back. After a two-year hiatus and some very real personal struggles. It's time for us to all come together and bring Mistletoe back. Okay. Um, let's see if this still works. ♪ I wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ I wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ I wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ ♪ Good tidings we bring ♪ ♪ To you and your kin ♪ ♪ Good tidings for Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ We wish you a merry Christmas ♪ ♪ And a happy new year ♪ Isn't that something?

Um, sir, if you don't mind me asking, what are you doing here? Well, I was floored by your report. Absolutely floored. I had to come see for myself. Yeah. I mean this is something special. Yes, it is. And you two have something special. You made my choice very difficult. So much talent we interviewed this week. Well, he really deserves it. And he pulled this whole party together. Oh no, no, no. Tara, she brought out the entire town, brought "em together. But Sam deserves so much credit and... Now wait a minute. I'm confused. - What? - Your report. The two of you did it together. Well, we both worked on bringing Christmas back to Mistletoe together, but we each had our own reports, didn't we? Mia? Didn't we? I only received one report. With the... with the two of you as a team. And let me tell you it was unbelievable. So much so that I'd like to lobby the board to hire you both. If that's okay. Both of us? Like as a team? Like together? - On the air? - At the same time? What do you think? I love it. I... I love it! - I love it. - We can... We can talk details soon, but right now you enjoy your evening. I need some hot-buttered rum. Mr. Ron, thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. - Congratulations. - Thank you. Don't be mad. You did a joint report? Look, I knew that you had to stand out, okay. And when I saw you guys working together, it was just perfect. Like nothing I've ever seen or anyone's ever seen or done before and Sam said it was okay, so... You knew about this? I mean, Mia is very convincing. And Ron did say he wanted to be blown away. Mia, wait, what? Yeah. So, we did it! Time to party. Come here. Hey, do you mind if we give this a spin? For you guys, anything. What are we doing? Okay. Just a wait... Okay, wait, wait, wait. Okay. What? Tara, look, just look at how happy everybody is. Yeah. You did this. We did this. Together. My, I'm so happy right now. Oh, did you read your card? No. You better read that. So, here's the thing, I was thinking... This wasn't part of the forecast. Mm-mm. Snowball effect, right? I guess so. The days when we were young And Christmas was the best day of the year The best day of the year Good morning, Sam. Good morning, Tara, and good morning New England. Today, we're looking at a low pressure system with a barometer reading of 29.8 with a sudden shift downwards towards 29.6. Which means that sunshine you all enjoyed yesterday is going to go sailing away with those umbrellas if you try to use one this afternoon. As thundershowers develop and fly in with gusts of 50 miles per hour. So, please hold onto those hats. High temps of 80, low of 60. Shorts and T-shirts, and maybe even a hoodie if you're out on an evening walk. And for you sports fans. Oh no, no, Tara, please don't tell me the Red Sox are getting rained out today. You're in luck. The system will give way to more sunshine after 6:20 p.m. just in time for... The opening pitch. Which I just so happen to have two lower level tickets to. Mm. So let's take a look at the rest of our week.
