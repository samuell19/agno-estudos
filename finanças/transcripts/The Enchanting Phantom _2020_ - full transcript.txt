What's going on? Nothing, Master. Hold on. What's the sound? Master. I think it came from there. Let's have a look. Roger that. Why is there a boat? Let's have a look. Come on. Come over here. Don't run. Pretty lady. Come on. Come over here. Come on. Don't run. Pretty lady. I have been waiting for you. Tianlang. Qisha. Xuanjing. Get ready. Plough of the sky. All stars in formation. Initiate. Master, you're great. It's unexpectedly easy. What's going on? What's happening? Second Junior. Master. Formation. Formation of the Five Elements. With the protection of Vajra, devils and demons shall be killed. The spirit of a demon hunter is indeed delicious. Old demon. You only know secret plots? Fight me if you dare. The two of you should practice more. Yes, Granny. Devils. I'm going to kill all of you. Hubby. You met such a tragic death. Go away. Get lost. Kind sir. Please spare me some change. Go away. What are you looking at? Please sympathise me. Kind sir. Please spare me some change. Please spare me some change. Kind sir. Kind sir. Here you go. Brother, lend me your bowl. What's wrong with you? Stand right there. Return my money. Don't move. It's him. It's him, brother. It's you. It isn't me, brother. Brother. It really isn't me. That fellow looks more similar. Brother. Don't run. I'm talking about you. Stand right there. The last strike of the Big Dipper. Protect Heaven. May devils be struck. Are you blind? Get lost. Sorry. How can I live in such a chaotic time? Sir. Buy a coffin from us. No need. A coffin is always needed. No need. Do you think you'll live eternally? Here. Let's drink. Cheers. Let's drink. Sir. What to drink? A bowl of water. Water? What a poor fellow. Let's get drunk. All of you must get hammered. Drink it. Poor fellow. Who did that? Secret weapon. Who was that? Who used the bun as a secret weapon? Laitou The Eight. Was that you? Was that all of you? Jinqian The Seven. Don't you slander us. Brothers. Kill them. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. Excuse me. Stop fighting. Stop fighting. The unfilial descendant of Ning family, Ning Caichen, can't go back to worship the ancestors. Here's some simple tribute. Please forgive me, my ancestors. Such a beautiful painting. It's a waste to leave it here. Bewitching energy. Yan Chixia. Don't run. Zhiqiu Yiye. You've been chasing me for three days. Are you done? There's no best scholar, nor second best warrior. That also applies in the magic world. Today we have to find out who's better. Stop blathering. Get here. Is it fun? Charm of Immobilisation. Brother. Do me a favour. You're being serious? This is not a joke. You haven't progressed, Zhiqiu Yiye. I'm going to stop playing along now. Yan Chixia. Don't go. Wind, thunder, rain, lightning, all come together. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Raise. Don't go. Please save me. You, don't go. Where's the painting? What a silly one. You're lucky. You forced me to do it. That child isn't mine. Surely not mine. Who's that? I saw you. Hello? Anybody there? Is there anyone? May I... Why are you here? Miss. Have we met before? Excuse me. My name is Ning Caichen. I pass by while heading to the capital for exams. May I please stay here for a night? Sorry for disturbing. Sir. If you don't mind, you may stay here for a night. Sorry for the disturbance. I'm sorry. Miss, you walk so fast. Please, come in. Miss. Your place is cold. You must have caught a cold. Have a cup of warm tea. Good idea. Good idea. What's that sound? Sir. Sir. Maybe something was knocked over. It's okay. No. It would be bad if it's something precious. Let me have a look. Sir. You're so naughty. You've torn my skirt. I... It wasn't intentional. It wasn't intentional. Sir. I'm so cold. I'm so hot. Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. No way. No way. No way. See nothing indecent. Hear nothing indecent. See nothing indecent. Hear nothing indecent. See nothing indecent. A gentleman is frank and poised. A gentleman is frank and poised. How could I do such a thing? Ning Caichen. You're a piece of rock. You're a piece of rock. Sorry. Who's that? Sorry. Was it you? Sorry. Do you want to die? Do you want to die? I'll kill you. Sorry. It's you. It isn't me. I've traveled miles to find you. Turns out I found you effortlessly. You've done me so much harm. Yet you didn't even apologize. Stop playing tricks. Are you going to say there's a demon? There's a demon. I knew you would say that. Magic of heaven and earth, trace! Is there really a demon? This demon isn't easy to deal with. Could it be just the wind? Is your device broken? Go away. Why is Granny here? What a fragrant vital energy. Horrible demon. I'll reveal your original form. The spirit of five elements. Transformation of condensed air. Punishment of the One. Use of Thunder Soldiers. Order of thunder and earthquake. Why did you strike me? Strike him. Forget about it. I'll do it myself. Little mage, you're too young. Let him go. Help! Help! Pure vital energy of Yang. You're the one. Horrible demon, let him go. Instant Boomerang Sword. Miss. It's you. Hey, no one needs your help. I can handle it myself. This is not the time to be arrogant. Miss. Be careful. It's dangerous here. Hide behind me. Miss, it's... Miss. Miss. Miss. What a fool. Miss. Keep your voice down. Miss. Where... Where did you go? Watch out. Swords of All Directions. Fire of Five Sins. You've saved me again. I don't know your name. My name is Nie Xiaoqian. Nie Xiaoqian. It sounds good. Rotter demon hunter. We don't concern each other. Why are you working against me? I don't care if you kill the villains. But look at this scholar. Although he has no mighty potential, he has good appearance, with laudable quality. Just like me. No matter what, he doesn't deserve to die. Busybody. I must have this scholar. You're not showing us respect. I'll take the two of you as well then. Whistle of Black Soul Bone. Black Mountain Demon is calling for me. You're lucky this time. She escaped so quickly. I'm not done fighting. Hey, fellow. How are you? You're really fortunate. The God of Death doesn't want to accept you. How is he? Don't worry. Some evil spirit got into him. I've chased it out. Why did you irritate that Old Demon again? All because of him. What are you doing here in the middle of the night? I came after the bewitching energy of that Old Demon. Since you're fine, I shall leave now. You can't leave. Why? Because our contest hasn't been over yet. Old Demon is here again. Where is she? You're cheating. Don't you go. Wait for me. The Whistle of Black Soul Bone called for me. What may I do for the Black Mountain Demon? Regarding the marriage, please tell him, three days later, just send someone to pick her up. Rotter demon hunters. They have injured my vital essence. Bring the useless creature here. Don't you think I don't know. Tell me. Why did you keep releasing the scholar? Don't be angry, Granny. If It weren't for the two demon hunters, Xiaoqian might have succeeded. I don't think so. Rotter demon hunters. I want you to die horribly. Granny. Don't be angry. The demon hunters can't protect the scholar forever. Why don't you let Xiaoqian try again? If she fails again, you may punish her then. Granny. Xiaoqian has failed once. Why don't you let me do it? Are you qualified to talk here? Xiaoqian. You're always my favourite girl. The pure vital energy of Yang on the scholar is very important to me. You have to get it back. Or else... Don't disappoint me. Roger that. Where am I? Oh, no. I have to hurry. Don't worry. Regarding Granny, I'll plead for you. In 3,000 miles of the shallow river, calmness is only found at the bottom. We're like a feather on the river. We don't float but sink. We're in eternal sorrow. You're not a feather. One day, you'll finally leave here. As long as we wear the Bell of Soul Constraint, we'll have to stay here. To Granny, I'm just her puppet. Such heavy rain. An abandoned temple. Great. [Aranya Temple] Aranya Temple? There's a demon. Demon! Do I really look like a demon? You... You... You are the guy with mustache. What guy with mustache? My name is Yan Chixia. Yan Chixia? Shhh. Keep it low. Many people are sleeping here. If you disturb their sleep, your life may be shortened. What are you doing here in the middle of the night? I'm here to spend a night. Spend a night? Why don't you look at those who're spending their night here? Could they be dead people? You're right. Here. Come with me. Forget about it. I... I'm not coming along. Not coming along. It's raining heavily now. In addition to the strong Yin energy, it's the best time for the demons to appear. Come on. I've prepared you a luxurious room. Don't worry. It's safe here. This is odd. How could such a big temple be abandoned? Back then, this was the residence of an aristocratic family. For unknown reasons, the entire family died tragically overnight. The local folks wanted to suppress the evil energy, hence, they collected funds to build this temple. On the day when it's completed, the abbot met his sudden death. The rest of them just left. Eventually, only these unclaimed bodies are left here. Why are you staying here then? Could you be homeless too? Don't ask unnecessary questions. Lest I'll pull your tongue out. This is your room. Am I staying here alone? What? Do you want me to sleep with you? No need. Take this. I'll lend you this Incantation of Exorcism, to ward off evil spirit. What does it mean? When you meet demons, just read accordingly. No matter what you hear, don't open the door. This thing can't be brought into nor out of this world. Why don't you leave it here for the sake of good karma? Bewitching energy. Where are you fleeing to? Escape? No way. Help. I'm not afraid of you. Help! Help! Help! Help! Lives are a priority. Help! Nie Xiaoqian. The reed flourishes, while dew freezes to snow. The one I miss, is across the river. What are you talking about? I mean I didn't expect to meet you here. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. What happened to you? My family is killed by the demons. If I hadn't been quick enough to escape here, I might have been... Xiaoqian. Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Xiaoqian. What are you doing? I'm doing what men like. Xiaoqian. You've changed too quickly. No way, Xiaoqian. No way. No way, Xiaoqian. You tore my clothes. Mind can be messed up, but not the clothes. No, no. Clothes can be messed up, but not the mind. Mind can't be messed up. Mind can't be messed up. Are you afraid of me? No. Why are you hiding then? I... There's a demon. I'm afraid. Demon? Where is it? Where is the demon? Don't be afraid. Don't be afraid. Demon. Xiaoqian. What's going on? What is that? This is the Incantation of Exorcism. Oh, right. Xiaoqian, take it. Yan Chixia said, only demons are afraid of this. Could you be a demon? That can't be. How can such a pretty lady be a demon? Only demons are so pretty. Xiaoqian. Just leave. You're willing to let me go? Leave, hurry. When Yan Chixia is here, you can't escape. I will not be grateful for you for letting me go. Don't you regret it. Xiaoqian. Sadly, she's a demon. It would be good if she's a human. The guy with mustache is rather good. Today, I was almost defeated by him. The one I miss, is across the river. You don't seem normal today. Nothing. Sooner or later, he'll be killed by Granny. Don't you ruin yourself because of him. I get it. Xiaoqian. All men are corrupted. They are nice to you because they have a purpose. Once their purpose is fulfilled, they'll just kick you off. Don't worry. When it's dark, I'll take action. How could such a good lady be a demon? Didn't you sleep well last night? I slept very well. It's a chaotic time. Why don't you learn some self-defence skill? What's the use of reading books? You don't understand. Exactly because it's a chaotic time, we should read the books of the sages. Yan Chixia. Since you're so mighty, why don't you get out there to do something great? Why are you so busybody? Mind your own studies. You don't look like a bad person. If You're willing to study, you'll surely be a good officer. A good officer? Yes. I'm too old for that. My book is on fire. Granny. Yes. Xiaoqian hasn't come back yet. Don't you care? All of you are useless. For my breakthrough this time, I must use the pure vital energy of Yang from this scholar. Angel and Devil. It's been 300 years. You must be lonely. It's time to go out and have a walk. Time for food. You were either killed by enemies or died in a foreign land. But it isn't too bad. It's a chaotic time now. Death is rather peaceful. Unlike me. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. There's bewitching energy again. It's so happening. We're closed. Go back. There's God in both heaven and earth. When celestial beings arrive, mortal beings should make way. You're full of bewitching energy. How dare you claim to be a celestial being? You're only a mortal being. How dare you misbehave in front of me? Kill without mercy. Stay right there. Seal. Have a good sleep. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian, why are you here? Oh, no. Xiaoqian. Go quickly. When Yan Chixia is here, you wouldn't escape. Hurry. Xiaoqian, what's wrong? Don't you know that I came to kill you the last time? Xiaoqian. If my life is so important to you, then... Then... Then you shall take it. Silly one. Go quickly. When Granny is here, you wouldn't escape. What about you? I'll have my way. Don't you worry. No. We should leave together. Yan Chixia. Xiaoqian, wait for me here. Don't ever go out. Yan Chixia. Yan Chixia. Yan Chixia. Stand right there. It's dangerous. Don't come here. Yan Chixia. Are you alright? Do you need help? Get me the sword. Sword? Okay. Sword. Xiaoqian. Why is there another demon? She's my friend. Should I introduce my two friends to you as well? No need. Throw the sword to me. Catch. It was very close. Hey! It's dangerous here. Let's go. The big one can't take it anymore. It's your turn, tiny one. Go quickly. The Angel and Devil are here. That means Granny is nearby. The Incantation of Exorcism. The Incantation of Exorcism. It's too late. My Incantation of Exorcism. Granny. Granny. I was right. She really fell for that man. If we hadn't followed her, we would be fooled for even longer. Why? You would rather trust a man, than listen to me. Shuangshuang, listen to me. Demons! Look. That's how man is. Xiaoqian. You're always my favourite girl. If you want to be married, I'll marry you to Black Mountain Demon. No. Granny, please. Please don't marry me to Black Mountain Demon. Please. Granny. Why did you do that? Because I like you. I can't leave you alone. I have to save... You traitor. How dare you betray me? From now on, I'll not be controlled by you. Xiaoqian. Unification of sword and heart. Unity of all directions. Rotter scholar. I told you not to run around. It's too late. Let's go. Hey. What about Yan Chixia? Rotter demon hunter. You have ruined my business. Stop blathering. Old Demon. I, Yan Chixia, am going to tear you apart. Burial with the sea of blood. The world is infinite. Power from the universe. Dance of fellow demons. Sword of infinity. Old Demon. I've destroyed your thousand-year-old practice. You can no longer do harm. Rotter demon hunter. I won't let you get away with this. Talk to the God of Death. When I reincarnate in a hundred years, I'll pursue you for lives. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. How are you? Are you injured? Where's the Old Demon? Did she hurt you? It's safe here. I'm glad that you're fine. It's good that you're fine. Where are we? My father was a first-class officer. He had great power. That's also why he offended many people. And then, the enemy came. Our family, with over 120 members, were all killed. Later on, Granny took me away, and turned me into a demon. I didn't expect your life to be such a tough one. It's okay, Xiaoqian. I'll not let you suffer anymore, nor force you to do what you don't want to. I'll flee with you as soon as the sun rises. The world is big. There will be a place that belongs to us. Stop it. Leave as soon as the sun rises. Don't see me again. Why, Xiaoqian? Are you still afraid of the Old Demon? I... He's here. Who is here? He's here for me. Who's here? Leave, hurry! Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Xiaoqian. Don't get near. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Just leave. Stop looking for me. Just leave. Leave. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian, where are you? Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Rotter scholar. Do you want to die? Please. Please save Xiaoqian. I beg you. Are you done? I'm a demon hunter. But you ask me to save a demon? Xiaoqian is a demon, but she's kinder than many men. If she is not spared, does justice even exist? Stop it. So what if there's no justice? The Black Mountain Demon had ten-thousand-year practice. He's much more powerful than the intersexual Old Demon. I beg you. You're the only person who can save her. The Black Mountain Demon is in the World of Black Mountains. Common folks can't get in there. If you want to get in, you'll have to die. Okay. Die. Are you not afraid of death? If I can save Xiaoqian, death would be nothing to me. Rotter scholar. Fate has no mercy. There are many things which you can't control. Exactly because I've understood this principle, I've been hiding in Aranya Temple. Escape, while you can. Escape while you can. Can you escape forever? There's no difference between escaping forever and death. What are you doing? I can't defeat Black Mountain Demon alone. Are you willing to help? You're really willing to help? I'm just unlucky. That's great. This journey is doomed. I'll ask you for the last time, have you thought it through? Yes. I have to save Xiaoqian. This sword is given to me by my master. I'll lend it to you. At crucial moments, it can help you. I have some friends over there. They'll take you there. Remember. No matter what, you must get back before sunrise. Or else, you'll be trapped in the World of Black Mountains forever. Path of Black Mountains, has no coming back. Soar to the skies, cross the shallow waters. If you take extra steps, only you may help yourself. The world is infinite. Power from the universe. Atmospheric transformation. Open the Door of Hundred Sins. Spirit, please guide the way. There's no way into hell. Shapeless and invisible. Held by hundreds of sins. Hello. May I know where the World of Black Mountains is? Get on. May I know... Why you are going to World of Black Mountains? Young man. I want to save Xiaoqian. She was caught by Black Mountain Demon. Do you know what kind of a place the World of Black Mountains is? I don't care what kind of a place it is, I must save her. Interesting. Interesting. Take this. You're looking for Xiaoqian? Let's go. Over here. Over here. Come over here. I'm here. Over here. From now on, you have to help yourself. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Is that you, Xiaoqian? Ning Caichen, I'm here. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Ning Caichen. Xiaoqian. I'm here. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Xiaoqian. I'm coming. Ning Caichen. Why are you here? I came to save you. Do you know what kind of a place this is? Do you want to die? No. I won't leave you here. Run quickly. I can't escape. When he's here, you can't escape either. Rotter scholar. If you don't come out now, you'll be trapped in World of Black Mountains forever. I'll never ever leave you here. Nie Xiaoqian. He's here. Let's go. Shuangshuang. Leave, hurry. Shuangshuang. Leave, hurry. Let's go. Shuangshuang. Rascal. Take this. Shuangshuang. Leave, hurry. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Why did you take so long? What overbearing bewitching energy. It stretches for 800 miles. Nie Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Nie Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Nie Xiaoqian. Why are you standing here? Run! Run! Yan Chixia. Yan Chixia. Black Mountain Demon. Fight me if you dare. Millions of Swords. What took you so long? I'm sorry. I was delayed on my way here. Why did you irritate such a big demon? It's a long story. Let's first get this done. Okay. Watch out. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Watch out. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Are you alright? Xiaoqian. This is the Demon Locking Formation of Black Mountain Demon. We can't get out of it. Let's go. Listen up. I'll be the main attacker. You'll assist me. I'll assist you? It's coming. What are you doing? Take actions. Okay. The spirit of five elements. Transformation of condensed air. Punishment of the One. Use of thunder soldiers. Order of thunderstorm and earthquake. Brother. Your skill isn't working. What do you know? I'm just assisting. What do we do now? We can't go on like this. Black Mountain Demon uses Black Mountain as basis to absorb millions of resentments. We can't damage his foundation this way. What do we do then? If we want to destroy his primordial spirit, we have to enter his body. Hold on. I'll get in. Why are you still here? We couldn't go out that way. Are you done? My sword can't damage his primordial spirit. Figure something out. Rotter scholar. Use the Incantation of Exorcism. Incantation of Exorcism. How to use it? Toss it. Okay. Ning Caichen. I can't hold on any longer. Xiaoqian. No. Your soul will be destroyed forever. Hurry. No. No, Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. The world is infinite. Power from the universe. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. What is that? The Black Mountain Demon has harmed many people. Now, the Wheel of Demon Reincarnation is initiated. Demons who enter the Wheel will reincarnate as a human. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. No. No, Xiaoqian. No, Xiaoqian. No. Let go. Her soul is wearing out. You have to let her enter the Wheel of Demon Reincarnation, so she'll have the hope to live. Or else, she'll be doomed forever. Let go. No. No. I don't know your name. My name is Nie Xiaoqian. Nie Xiaoqian. You tore my clothes. You're willing to let me go? When Yan Chixia is here, you wouldn't escape. I like you. I can't leave you alone. I have to save... Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Ning Caichen. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Xiaoqian. Yan Chixia. Yes? I'll never see Xiaoqian anymore, right? If she's a demon, what's the point of you seeing her? Do you think after years, will I meet her again in the crowd? I wonder if I can have the faint fate to meet her then. I hope by then, the world won't be so cruel anymore. Yan Chixia. It's been a tough time for you. Why don't you stay longer? Since we have so much in common. Are you really leaving now? No. I have to head to the capital for exams. Why get scholar-honour at such a chaotic time? I'd rather be a dog in peace, than be a human in chaos. Why don't you stay back to hunt demons with me? You'll be more unrestrained. Demons are endless. I want to be scholarly honoured, be a good officer. So no one would die unfairly. This will be the true justice. Rotter scholar. Have a look. How is this? You have an explicit taste. My master doesn't like it. Here you go. Okay.
