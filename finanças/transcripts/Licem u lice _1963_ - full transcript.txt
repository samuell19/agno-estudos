What will you do now? Wait... What happened? - Brka! What did they say? - They rejected the complaint. The director says the collective doesn't want him. FACE TO FACE Roles Today at 2:30 p.m. PARTY MEETING AGENDA 1. THE CASE OF MILUN KOPRIVICA 2. MISCELLANEOUS Čumić Voja... Here. Čubura Bora... Bratić Dušanka? Here. Koprivica Milun? I'm here. - Koprivica Kaća? - Yes. I'm here. Kosijer Slobodan? - Here. - Spasić Ilija? What about Ilija? He said he'd come. He stopped by the house for medicine. Good. Pravdić Stevan? Here, here, I'm here. I shaved quickly. Brkić Petar? Brka, come in. He's calling you. I'm here, bro. Bratić Miloš here... Antić Nada? - A woman looks after children. - No comment, Ranko! - Sremac? - Yeah, I'm here. Daskalović Mitke? - Mitke, speak up. - He saw me. I brought him with the director. Maletić Trajče? - I came. - Wait a minute, Radovan, let's see. Can Trajče be present at all if he's no longer in our Company? Why not, if he's a member of the Organization? I don't agree that he's a member or that he's present. Is it possible, comrades, that a communist goes too far and is kicked out of the Company but we do nothing? - We still list him as a member. - That's sad. They kick out a communist and the Party is silent. - Trajče's case should be discussed. - Right. Trajče's case was resolved, Milun, where it should be. And you, Jova, don't create problems. Someone is taking care of Trajče, don't worry. Can you call faster, Radovan? I have two more meetings today. Andrija Mačkić? He was just here. - Hey... - What is it, Andrija? Did a friend leave a package for me? Here it is. - Hasn't it started? - It started. - Why aren't you in the meeting? - Bah... I have an important job. 30,000 dinars, maybe more is at stake. - Eh... you didn't see me. - Fine. Bye. - Miko... - Hurry. Miko! Please... Come on... see what's wrong with it. Dača, what will happen to Milun? No idea. Be a friend and fix it right away. - Look at the spark plugs. - Yes... - Car Pera? - He's on the site too. - Sorry, Radovan, my motorcycle died. - All right. - Volodobija Marijan? - Here. And Sveta Malibrk? Svetislav Malibrk, Comrade Secretary. I'm here. Svetislav. I wasn't called! - How's that? - I don't know. Well, so it is. We forgot to write you in. - Who are you again? - Pavle Vrtelić, junior technician. I didn't receive a membership card either. Easy, Comrade Pajo, we just enrolled you. I waited seven months for a membership card. A Party membership card isn't a small thing. That was then. Let's get started, people. How can you start when half the people are absent?! Where is Stanimir, for example? He called. A man is moving in. Moving in how?! - Where is he moving in?! - I don't know exactly... Engineer Jović and Pera's group are on the site. All right, Radovan, why was the meeting convened so hastily, right from work? - We didn't even have lunch. - It was urgent. - Do we have a quorum? - Yes, Comrade Director. 19 present, 9 missing, so we have the required majority. Then you start, and give me the floor. Who will keep the minutes? Vera. Comrade Dušanka, she's secretary in the Directorate anyway. By God, Dača, I'm tired of those minutes. Who does what, all I do is take minutes!? Fine. All right. Vera, take the post. I open this meeting of the Basic Organization of the League of Communists of our Company... - Hello. - And please, comrades... Hello. - It's a meeting, Vuk. - That's why we came. What is this, Radovan? These are organizational issues. - It's out of order. - So what?! - Is the meeting open or not? - Yes. - How long will you moan, Jova?! - Easy, Brka... Easy. Come in, comrades. You just can't vote. We know we're not members. Let's sit down. - Sit somewhere, Vuk. - I can see better this way. Will you say something, or should I get to the point? I will. It's well known in relation to the first point... Comrade Milun Koprivnica was admitted to the Party in the partisans in 1943. And he's been in the Company almost since its foundation. Wait. And he is a member of our Workers' Council. His case is on the agenda at the request of the Directorate and Board. Comrade Director asked for it personally. Yes, but as a member of the Secretariat of the Organization, not as Director. - Here's the thing, comrades... - Easy, Comrade Čumić. - First of all, no agenda exists yet. - Who says? - How doesn't it exist?! - Nobody proposed or adopted it. Excuse me, Milun, the agenda stands nicely on the board. I wrote it myself. - And I personally erased it. - How can you erase the agenda? How can Comrade Čumić impose it? Just make up a case against Comrade Koprivica and now, fellow communists, hit Milun with it. - We won't do it. - I didn't impose the agenda, the Secretariat of the Organization adopted it. - Right. - The Secretariat can only suggest, we'll see if it will be adopted. Please, that's a formal question. No, Comrade Malibrk, it's essential. I asked for this meeting in writing due to the situation in the Company and specifically because of the treatment of Trajče. And I propose it be the first item on the agenda. Right. We should discuss the situation in the Company and Party. - What did you want, Pajo? - Well... that, about the agenda. - I think Comrade Milun is right. - OK, he's right and he proposed it. And I propose the first point be Milun Koprivica's case! Put it to a vote and let's count. That's right. To vote. Those for Milun Koprivica's proposal, raise your hand. Me. 2, 3... - What is that small faction, Brka? - We'll see who the faction is. - Let's see now. - Don't interrupt, Mitke. - Who is for Comrade Čumić's proposal? - Me. Did you vote, Kaća? I, uh, I'm very embarrassed... - It doesn't matter. - Why hold back, Kaća? You're a communist, vote as you think. Leave the woman alone. You hurt her a lot. That's our private business. Comrade Čumić's proposal is adopted. We move on to the first item on the agenda. The case of Comrade Koprivica. Čumić. Here's the thing, comrades, plain and simple. On Monday the ninth of this month, Milun Koprivica arbitrarily left work... and like a fury, without knocking, broke into my office. Without a good day or hello... just the eyes. "What's going on here, we're like this, we're like that..." He curses the Directorate, me, the Board of Directors... Just foaming. The office was full. There were people from outside too. I sank into the ground. Milun just kept pushing! He pounded his fist on the table, threatened by the Committee... by the Workers' Council... shouted... - Was that right, Milun? - The question is why I did it. - There's no reason for that. - Even if there is, is that the way, pounding your fist on the director's desk? Okay, I apologize if it's a question of the method. It's not about the method now. I'm already used to arguing and making peace with Milun. But lately there's been nothing but criticism here. The Directorate is attacked... the management staff's authority is undermined... and unfortunately, some communists are driving this. Especially Milun Koprivica. He consciously and deliberately agitates, upsets people, and ruins our collective unity! And that is a political problem. And that's not all, comrades. Here. This arrived the other day in the League of Communists Municipal Committee. An anonymous letter about alleged conditions in our Company and the Party Organization. Exactly all the same slanders that Milun utters. Now let me ask you: Can a man who works against his own collective be a member of the Party? And like this... behind your back? Like some spy and informant? Signed below... "A pal." I didn't write any letter to the Committee. Vera, please, on what machine was this typed? On this one here. Well, all of Milun's work reports were typed on this same machine and his letters to the Workers' Council. But wait, Čumić! I didn't write it, and I don't do such things. We know you won't admit it, otherwise you would have signed. After all, read it Vera. Even a madman would recognize Koprivica and his slanders. "When viewed from the outside, everything in our Company looks fine. Comrades in the Commune and the Committee must think so." Louder. "Because no one has come yet to see the real state of affairs here. First point: we have workers' self-management, but only on paper, because Comrade Director makes the decisions and the Workers' Council and Board of Directors just adopt and vote - not knowing what they voted for." - It won't be like that, Milun. "Second point: there are various irregularities and injustices and when someone criticizes, he is pushed from the Company as was the case with Comrade Trajče Maletić, a true Comrade and communist, whose job was terminated." Whose words are those, Milun? Read, read, Vera. "Third point: The company leaves unfinished objects since it takes other projects which it cannot do due to poor mechanization and capacity. We just get advance payments and share the surplus and no one asks how long it'll go on until we're finally bankrupt." - Pajo, what do you say? - That's right. If someone asked me... "Our party organization is asleep, especially since former Secretary Comrade Spasić Ilija stepped down, and it's not known how or why. The new Secretary dances to the Director's tune and the Union exists only for membership fees and distributing holiday tickets." - Milun, it's not true about the Union. - Don't interrupt! - Should I read everything? - Read. "It's all because here the communists are silent. No one wants to offend the Director and he doesn't tolerate anyone thinking on their own. So there is no choice but for the Committee to form a commission and examine everything so that one can speak freely and everyone can express their opinion without fear of being pushed from the Company. - Sincerely, 'Friend'." - Shame. - Writing such nonsense. - Yes. There it is, comrades. You heard the letter, you heard Milun threatened by the Committee, now judge for yourself who wrote this. - I sign that letter word for word. - There, you see... - So you admit it? - I have nothing to admit, and it doesn't matter who wrote it. What matters is it's all true, first word to the last. Now you'll prove it, falcon, that truth of yours. Everything! Point by point. That way, we'll know when we talk. - There are 20 witnesses! - The collective sees what's going on. We know how decisions are made. Don't beat around the bush ​​now, but prove it. Every word! When did I circumvent workers' self-management? Who did I impose my will on? The Board of Directors, when you fired Trajče! - It's not true. - It is! Ilija knows. He wouldn't lie. The meeting shouldn't have even started without Ilija! Radovan, you came here recently and don't know the situation, and Ilija was the Party Secretary and a member of the Board of Directors so he has something to say. I ask him to declare before the Organization why he stepped down. We know. He withdrew due to illness. He's had this stomach ulcer 10 years, why withdraw right now? If you're so interested, go and ask him. I'm not talking about Ilija or his ulcers now. It's about Trajče, and Ilija knows best... How long will you go on about Trajče? There is no Trajče case, it's about you, about your outbursts. If Ilija has anything to say, let him come here in person. He knew the agenda, and he'd come if he wanted, even sick. Who knows if you invited him? What are you talking about? I personally told him. Pass the phone, let's hear Ilija. And don't insult, Brka. What do you think we are? 2-0-7-5. 7... 5. - Phone, Ilija. - I hear, I'm not deaf. Why don't you answer? Maybe it's the godparents, about Sunday. Leave it! Don't touch it. Damn godparents and Sunday. Can I have lunch in peace in this house? Stop staring! Where are the kids? Why are you shouting? Žarka is at school and Svetlana at piano class. Yes, at piano class, and bad grades in school. The brat wants even high heels. - You bought them for her. - Yes. I buy and pay for everything, work like a slave. I work both overtime and part-time. You never have enough money for damn trinkets. Kids on the mulberry tree, growing up as snobs. Simpleton... How will I handle this if Ilija doesn't come? OK... Milun has strayed. That's clear. But why did Ilija step down? It got so tangled up. Why should I get into that mess? If only they'd given me time to prepare the meeting. Why isn't Ilija answering now? - He's not answering. - He must be coming here. - Excuse me, comrades. - Please. I'd like to ask Comrade Koprivnica about that letter, what do those insinuations mean about the situation in our Company? Sorry, Milun, but you you have no idea about that. As an economist and chief accountant, I can tell you that we are better off than ever. And when it comes to accounting, I think we have the most tidy situation in the Municipality. After all... let Comrade Kaća say what the Inspection told us about that. Say it, Kaća. Comrades, it's really awkward for me to talk, since it's about Milutin... You know we're getting divorced. Louder. And as for business, that's right... The inspection was satisfied. There, you see. All right, Kaća, sit down. OK, comrades. Did I really use the Workers' Council as a cover for my own decisions, as Milun says? And which of you communists is so scared that he can't say a word to criticize? As I recall, communists weren't afraid to speak their mind even when it meant their heads. Of course. If anyone else thinks like Milun and agrees with this letter, let him say so openly, and not chatter along the corridors. There's no individual or institution that cannot be criticized. Trajče and Milun criticized, and here they are. Who keeps grumbling there? After all, members of the Workers' Council are here, let them say: Sremac... Jova... Raka... When did I direct the decisions of the Workers' Council, as the letter said? When did you vote without knowing what for? What about reorganization and tariffs? Brka, you're not on the Workers' Council. I ask them. What is there to ask? Everyone votes by free will. Stevo, did I force you to vote against your conviction? Well... you didn't. And you, Raka? Did I impose my will on you, Milun? No, because you can't impose on me. Did you vote for what you don't understand? I didn't. I voted against. And what happened? Did I haunt you? And what did you do with Trajče?! He's been walking around three months without a job. He lost faith in the Party, justice and people. Allow me, Comrade Secretary, to ask: did we vote on the agenda, and why does Comrade Koprivica not respect Party discipline - but jumps on another subject again? - But he's not a subject! - He's a man. - That's right! Milun is right. Quiet, comrades. We can't do it like this. Ask for the floor. Go on. Why wasn't it read at the meeting, the complaint Trajče sent to this Party Organization? - Because Trajče withdrew the complaint. - Who says he withdrew it? - Why withdraw it? - You ask him. There is Trajče, let him explain himself. Come on, Trajče, recount how it all was. - I have nothing to say. - Tell them, to finally clear it up! What do I have to say? My case was taken off the agenda. It was resolved... I mean... Everything was by the book... Terminated job position and... - now I see myself I was wrong. - Well... I spoke in person with Comrade Director to get back to work, and he personally promised... Did you complain to the Municipality, the Union and the Organization? I complained, so what? - I withdraw the complaint. - But is that right, Trajče? Wait a minute, look me in the eye when I ask you. What did you tell us on the construction site? Nothing. There were no irregularities. I was wrong, what do you want from me now!? Really people, why are you attacking the man? Well, comrades, you heard Trajče... Milun's main proof. Neither man complains... or needs a lawyer. Now I suppose you all see what Milun's evidence looks like and where he went wrong. Excuse me, Radovan, it seems to me that Vera does not record at all what is said. Who is speaking, comrades? Come on, comrades. Shall we? Now we'll follow the good old custom of silencing the discussion. We'll raise our hands and vote for something, then go home. And tomorrow they'll chatter in the corners and write anonymous letters. It's weird with Trajče. He seemed to be saying one thing to Milun and another here. Which one is true? Is this really so clear and pure to Radovan? Dača! Dača! If you're more interested in the motorcycle than the meeting, leave. - Yes, Jova. - To close the window, - why is he listening? - Why not listen? The meeting is open and concerns the whole collective. Come on, by God... It's sad, there's a handful of people here, and you're silent. I really don't understand this silence, comrades. Such accusations are made here... anonymous letters are written... and you don't say a word. As if there is nothing to condemn! Now I will say. Just specifically, Raka, and no insults. Criticize if you must, Comrade, but constructively and in principle. Not like Milun. Come on, Raka, what now? I won't. While I figure out what constructively and in principle means to Dušanka... the train leaves. That Milun is a fool of God. What did he need this for? I told him nicely to give up useless work when he has no one to fight with or to fight for. Ilija got out of it nicely. He's smart. I should have found a reason not to come to the meeting too. Whatever I say, I'll offend either Čumić or Milun. If no one wants to, I'll speak. Comrades, we were discussing this morning, the Organization Secretariat and the Board of Directors, about Comrade Milun's actions... and in general about that anonymous letter and everything else. And so, since the case was proven and it's clear that unhealthy relations are being created, I can suggest... that is... I think that Comrade Milun, after this, can no longer be a member League of Communists. That's it. Wait, people, what is this? And why exactly, Radovan? Of course, expulsion, what else! You should be expelled as well. God, Mitke, who are you throwing out? Why are you interfering? Who asked you? Miko, what do those shouts from the window mean? Come in, Comrade, talk. I'll come in... but when ones like him come out! Are there any other suggestions? - Radovan... - Go ahead. I have a headache. May I? Do you want aspirin, Dača? If that's the case, put the proposal to a vote so we can move on to another item on the agenda. What else do we have? Miscellaneous. I'm putting Dušanka's proposal to a vote. Who is in favor of expelling Milun Koprivica? - Me! - Wait a minute, Radovan. Why do you need that vote when the decision was made this morning? Here, comrades, to save you the trouble of raising your hands. How does that look? Petty bourgeois business! You won't expel Milun Koprivica silently from the Party. And you won't break me or buy me, you know that, Čumić. Take this card, Milun. I'll take it, don't worry! You'll give it back to me yourself! But I won't participate in this! This has nothing to do with the Party! He should be punished for that too! Radovan, I don't agree and that's it! What don't you agree with? Nothing from the start! How do you run the Organization? That's right! It's not fair! Quiet, comrades. Silence. Silence, comrades! Quiet! - 10 minute break. - Why? Is this a meeting? Let people calm down a bit. - What do you say, Vuk? - You won't fight the director? Did I suggest it? You didn't suggest, but you weren't against it. - Let's hear it. - You know very well... Don't, Brka, these are the facts against Milun. What facts? The facts are in the letter. - Dad, I'm hungry! - What is it? I'm coming... What do you say to that? Milun confirmed it's all true. - Word for word. - Now you talk, there you were silent. - You still vote against Milun? - Is it my fault Trajče sold himself? He dragged Milun onto thin ice, now I bring him back? Some sell out for a job and salary, some for an apartment. What, should I stay in this hole for 100 years? It's easy for you, without even a dog or cat. I have three kids on my neck. Is it over? Here's your coat. It's a mess. Who knows when it'll end. And the cinema? Why did I pay 20 tens for the tickets? What can I do? Go alone when you're ready. I'm going, so you know. Whether I'll be alone, we will see. And you say something stupid there, God made you a fool. Forget those phrases, better to look at the dinar. Why do you keep going on about dinars, Malibrk? Jova, do you see these people around you now? Let me see my father when you stick money to me... Why didn't you take aspirin? I don't have a headache. I don't want to vote. - You don't know who drinks or who pays. - You're right. Where is Steva? I have no idea. - What for? - Nothing. I need him. Watch how you sit. Mitke is staring at your legs. Mitke, have you seen Steva? He was here a while ago. He's probably with Koprivica. What is it, General? You already peeled off the fender? By God, march! Listen, who are you harassing from the window all the time? You're sorry you were degraded from a Mercedes to a truck? And you can't wait to kiss the Director's ass? Watch what you say. - That's what your brother tells you. - Don't tell me! Have you started threatening too? - We'll talk more. - It just doesn't work for me. I'm not Trajče. 20 years of membership. He's getting old in the Party. Surely he gave something during that time. Did we make things a little too tight after all? But can a man return the card this way after 20 years? If you think you're right, prove it, Comrade! Fight. Hello. - Hello... Hello... - Dear listeners, now you'll hear... the broadcast of our quiz show "Show What You Know." The opponent was Denmark, the score was 3:1. Well done. The answer is correct. Are you moving on? I'm not going any further. So, you answered a question for 16,000 dinars. And now, dear listeners, for Comrade... Excuse me, what did you say your name is? Andrija... Andrija Mačkić. For Comrade Andrija Mačkić, a hearty round of applause. Ilija! Comrade Ilija! See... 16,000. - You know how? - I know, I was listening. - On the radio. - Why didn't you go further? I wanted to, but I was scared. I'm sorry now. I'm going. I went out for cigarettes. Listen, what happened at the meeting? Why you weren't there? Would that make sense? I prepared for that show 10 days, just to be left hanging. You know what, man... Let's have a drink. Come on. You'll buy cigarettes there. There's a cafe nearby. No... We weren't mistaken. Things need to be looked at in perspective. What Yesenin said... face to face... no face is visible. A lot can be seen from a distance. If we don't punish Milun now, the unity of the collective goes off. But... why don't people declare themselves? Why are they silent? What does that silence mean? Fear? Conformism? OK, Sremac is a nice guy, a peacemaker. But Steva? He always complains about something but he is silent at meetings. And Raka? He makes jokes but hides his thoughts like a snake's leg. Or that Dača? Why did he slip out when he should've voted? And this engineer? What does that Kosijer actually think? Radovan, this has gone beyond any measure. They openly call me a socialist gendarme here. Who calls you? That Raka, in front of everyone. - Why? - How should I know? Probably because I suggested expulsion for Milun. Just what I need. Whenever it's something awkward, - "Come on, Dušanka." - You offered yourself. I don't run away from tasks, Comrade. I don't know, Radovan, I'll present Raka's case at the meeting. I'm afraid there won't be too many of those cases. It's not good, Dušanka. There's something really wrong with us. That's why I interrupted the meeting. I was in other organizations, but I never saw communists pull out like this when they should take a stand. And look at them now. The Secretary dances to the Director's tune. But what does that Milun want!? For me to hit Čumić like we're on one side and Čumić on the other? Comrade Radovan, pass me that bag. That one on the bench. Where are you going? The meeting isn't over! To the train, it is already over. It will be as the Director decided. Let someone say what he wants... but guys like Čumić create a material base, without it there's no socialism. The goal is important. I have several fellow engineers in various companies. I could ask someone to hire you. It's not about the job, but honor. If it's about honor, why did you withdraw the appeal - and beg the Director? - Why? Can a man fight on his own? Who cares about some Trajče and his justice here!? Will there be any surplus again, Comrade Director? As you work, so it will be. - Is there any more powder? - No more. Do you have a headache? It's because you quit smoking. - Who said they had aspirin? - Vera. - I'll get it for you. - No... I can do it myself. You started going gray, Milutin. - I didn't even notice. - How long will you do that? Take care of yourself once. You can't go on forever like this. Everyone looks after themselves, only you care for someone else. - We've talked about this many times. - Yes... but in vain. Is there a glass? Here... Is it fresh? They just brought it. You have a headache? At least it's still on my shoulders. I can't wait for vacation, if some fuss doesn't stop me this year too. One needs to rest. I just said to Milutin... Kaća, did I pay you the membership fee for this month? I don't know. I'll check. You decorated this room well. You paid for next month too. Is this your ration from the war? From the Revolution. Eh, my Milun... I should put you over my knees and beat you until you come to your senses. If we had left our rifles like you left your Party card today... we would go far. Why did you... subvert me like that, Milun? Like we're not friends, by God? We were... when we ate that unsalted porridge from this same ration. And who is to blame for this today? Who hit the other behind his back? Who went to sue? If you came nicely, if something is wrong... "Voja, Comrade, such and such a thing..." we would manage somehow. Did you have someone to come to? That's what I told him. And another Milun would have gnashed his teeth and sought justice. Things look different from here and from your office. And that bothers you? Because I sit in a lousy armchair and ride in a limousine? Come sit in my place if you think it's easy for me. I don't sleep at night. It's harder than in the war! It’s about limousines and armchairs. - But you seem to have forgotten... - Forgot what? Did I betray the Revolution!? In the end, what are you really doing?! You fight for yourself, your position! I defend the collective's interests! And the community's. From whom do you defend them? Is it from me and Trajče? The community is not fog, they are people! And what do you make of them? - Just rags! - That's what you think! Many think so, they just don't dare to say! That's why people write anonymous letters. People said what they thought about both me and you. They'll say it now in a vote. And so you know... I'm sorry now about that bread that I ate with you. That's how you lose friends. The man gives you a hand and you... We've talked about that before. I know. Again in vain. I'll help you as much as I can. Thank you. I'll manage somehow. - Did you get the divorce summons too? - Yes, I think for the 20th. We could have lived so well... So let's not go there on the 20th? I don't know, Milutin. We're not for each other. Maybe I'm a petty bourgeois, as you say. But I couldn't reheat food all my life, to wait for you. To keep worrying about who you'll fight with again. You react abruptly. - It's not about the apartment. - I know it's not. The apartment was just the last straw. Call me sometime. I'm still with that old witch. Let's deal one more. Hey, Milun... Was that the Director a while ago? - It was. - Really? What did he want? And what do you want? You bastards play cards, and others break their neck for you. What's with him? He quarreled with the wife, so now it's our fault. Let's deal. There's Milun. Who will be our guarantor for that loan now? If they expel him from the Party, he'll surely be fired. - Should we ask Sremac? - What? Vera, aren't you listening to me? Who am I talking to? Baby, if we don't take out a loan, we can't go to the registrar. Dača, I have to tell you something about that letter at the meeting. - That's right, it's all true. - I typed it. Really!? Steva begged me to type it. - Are you crazy? - I didn't know he wouldn't sign! - Then Milun didn't write it! - No. I don't know what to do. It's not fair to blame someone innocent. - Why doesn't Steva say he sent it? - I don't know. It's awkward to ask him. Here we go, comrades! Let's go to the meeting! Come on, people! Let's go! Stevo, why are you silent about that letter! What should I do, Dača?! Admit it like a man and that's it! The Director would fire me right away. And let Milun suffer? It's not about the letter. He'd get fired anyway. - I'm a fool, I typed it for you! - It's not your fault. If you don't admit it, I'll say, you know. Don't, brother, I better say it myself. I'll admit it... - whatever happens. - Watch what you say. You know... - It's starting. - Come on! I'm coming, just to calm down a little. Do you have a cigarette? Let's go, Dača. C'mon, Vuk, we'll be late. I want to see what happens. We said just until the train. We don't have Jovica with the bread anyway. Why am I wasting time here and my cow is calving there? Milun... Could you answer now about giving me the apartment? Leave me alone about the apartment, Miko, please! Now we can shake it off and move on. I don't understand why we're here discussing this and that. By the way, there in the yard... - Did they have the vote? - No way. - They won't. - What are they waiting for? Let's go, comrades, be seated. I don't know where Jovica is with the bread! He isn't coming. Like he's gone to the end of the world. All right, comrades, where were we? If I'm not mistaken, the next item is miscellaneous. But people, we can't do it this way! It's time to say a good word about that Milun. He's our comrade. That is, he should be punished. But why expulsion? I feel sorry for the man. It's not a small thing. Write that down. Turn off that radio there! I already told Milutin himself that I disagree with his actions. But I should state something else. I've got to know him for these three years, and he is so much for our Party... His whole life is there. I don't know what he'll do and where he'll go if we... expel him. Excuse me, it's obviously a sentimental situation and I fully understand Comrade Kaća, but I don't understand why we are still holding back in the case of Comrade Koprivica. He returned the Party card himself. His action was condemned, - now we can move on to miscellaneous. - Wait, Malibrk. He returned the card, that's Milun's show. But I don't think the Party Organization condemned enough that criticism and intrigue. Here is... that letter. You heard it. I ask that this matter be clarified politically and to take a stand. Come on, comrades, who wants to speak? And not the same men again. What about the others? The others are thinking. Raka, I'll remove you from the meeting! Why? Is it forbidden now to think? You know very well why, and don't think I'll just skip over what you just told me in the yard. Well, sue me in court for comradely criticism. It's fashionable now. Is this a bunch of market vendors or a Party meeting? All right... Put Dušanka's proposal to a vote. Where is Steva now? All in favor of punishing Milun Koprivica by expulsion, raise your hand. Me! I am for punishment... but I'm not for expulsion. Six. - Who's against? - Me! Three. All right. Six for expulsion, three against and there are 19 of us. - 18 without Koprivica. - 17. - Steva's missing. - Yes, Steva's missing too! All right, 17. But only nine of us voted! What about the others? Did you vote, Comrade Kosijer? I didn't. I think I can abstain. You can... Only... It's just that you don't care at all, Comrade Engineer. That's what you wanted to say, Radovan. You see, Secretary, it may be clear to you, but not to me. And I won't vote just like that. But what isn't clear to me? Trajče... It's not about him now, but Koprivica. And do I agree with those outbursts and writing anonymous letters? Okay, what did we vote for now? Nothing. Nothing. I understand. It's difficult to raise your hand and expel a Comrade from the Party. It may be hardest for me. You all know that Milun and me fought together in the War. In the same company. When the Company was established, I personally brought him here. He is good as a worker. If he wants, he can work for two. But is that enough, comrades? We also elected him to the Workers' Council. And instead of constructively cooperating, he lectures everybody. Attacks the Company management, upsets our collective. Is that the political work of a communist? Here, let's put aside that... anonymous letter and all he's done to us lately. Let's see a bit what he's like as a human being. What did he do with this... Kaća? I'm sorry, Kaća. It's your private business. But I have to say it. It's not exactly private business. Both Milun and Kaća are communists. They lived separately for 3 years, and we gave them an apartment. But Milun acted like Milun... He pulled out and gave it to Mika, to act important. And what will happen to Kaća and with their marriage, that's Milun's last concern. Here they are, let's help! Take care of the kid! - They got here at last. - Where are you going? Give me that radio! Not this, the other one. Be a little careful! You'll break it, people! Don't do that. Leave it now. It's good. Hi, Mika. What happened? You're a bit gloomy. Did you move in? Like hell I moved in! And you, Milun, don't mention justice, socialism or God to me anymore, do you hear! Stop, Miko. What's the matter? Was I first on the list? Am I the most urgent case? - Come on, am I? - You are. Your Director gave the apartment to some Comrade Malibrk! An important person for the Company! A big expert! And what am I? A driver! - Nobody, nothing! - What Malibrk? From the Directorate! He came a month ago. I can be behind the steering wheel 14 hours a day, it doesn't matter. My children can die in that mess! That doesn't matter either! - Quiet, Mika, calm down, damn it! - I won't be quiet! I'll shout to God! Let me go! Comrades give apartments to themselves and let others die! Is that socialism then? What's that about socialism and communists!? Why didn't you give your apartment when you heard they were taking mine! Talking about justice and consciousness! Damn your justice! Here's the document, move into my apartment! - Milun! - Move in when I tell you, by God! And go to hell, you and those lousy apartments and that commission! There's something fishy with that apartment, by God. Who is crazy enough to give up an apartment? - Really, Mitke? - What? What are you trying to say? That he took money? If you weren't in the meeting, you'd see your God! - Who are you threatening? - OK, Mika, - how long will you heckle over there? - He got me started! Enough, you two! - He's always interfering... - And don't interrupt. I want to say about that apartment... Milun didn't hesitate to ruin even his marriage... and to make this woman unhappy. And why? To prove he is supposedly the only communist and comrade in the Company. And the rest of us? By God, what we are? About that apartment, I mean how Milutin acted... That's how he is. When he gets started, he doesn't see anything. Not himself, or me, his brother, nobody... But it's only fair to say, it's not, as the Director said, to prove that he is the only communist. I don't agree with that. I don't claim that he is a conscious enemy, Kaća. No. But when someone acts like this and creates anarchy to the detriment of the collective and the community, that's an enemy action for me. And no one has the right to petty- bourgeois sentimentality and restraint. Otherwise, you're just the same as him. Of course. Put it to a vote so we can see where everyone stands. Excuse me, I still stick to logic. Comrade Koprivica returned his Party card and that's enough. He expelled himself. I said I wouldn't stand on formalities. I agree with what Mitke said. Put the matter to a vote again, either-or. Where were you? Why are you late? - Comrades, I'm putting... - Comrade Steva has something to say. Go ahead, Steva. Just not about apartments again, please. No, uh... that's what I wanted to ask, uh... What are you up to? About that anonymous letter to the Committee... What? Nothing, I just wanted to ask: How did the Director get the letter if it was sent to the Committee? What do you mean how? The comrades gave us the letter to investigate and to condemn such an act. - Why are you sitting there? Speak. - Let it go. Steva, what is it? Come on, Radovan, let's vote. Time passes and we're not getting anything done. Comrades... This is not just about Milun and if we will punish him this way or that. In my opinion, that's beside the point. It's much more about us and our attitude. We've already become the problem. Here is a communist returning his Party card. He uses an anonymous letter and the Organization is silent! What does abstaining from voting mean? Opportunism? - Disinterest? - Steva... Those who aren't interested have no place in the Party! A communist must have a position! That's right! I'd record every abstention in the minutes. All for expelling Milun Koprivica from the League of Communists, raise your hand. Dača! Why are you fidgeting? Don't say you have a headache again! Did you vote, Comrade? - Ten. - What's wrong with you? - Who is against? - Me! - Me! - What are you doing? - What? I didn't even vote for him. - What are you voting for, Vera? - Against expulsion. Five. - What about you, Raka? - I abstain. - And you, Trajče? - Me too. Vuk, you can't vote. I know, but let them see I'm against. Just don't count me. All right. Vera, write down: 10 for expulsion... five against... and three abstentions. What's the matter, Mika? It's nothing... So... The majority decided to expel Comrade Milun Koprivica... from the League of Communists. Expel from the League of Communists... Expel from the League of Communists... Expel from the League of Communists... Expel... Expel... Expel from the League... And now Milun is bothering him. What did you say, old man? Milun. As soon as he opens his mouth, he talks about the war. A bore. Who is a bore? - Watch what you say! - Come on, OK, old man. It doesn't matter, Milun is a force. Well... should we go? By the way, do you know a cafe where there's good music? You're a louse, that's what you are! - Milun's expelled and you drink! - Wait, I'm just... A louse, that's what you are. Really... And what are you? Think I don't know why you're not in the meeting? You're afraid to cross Čumić! That's the point! Who did you tell that to? Listen... Old man, am I really a louse? I got drunk once and I just had to bump into you. Go home and get some sleep. - Where do you live? - In the barracks, with Milun. Listen old man... Tell me openly... if I'm really like that, - I'll say honestly at the meeting. - C'mon, let's go. Now it should be brought before the Workers' Council to decide whether a man who destroys what we've created with blood and sweat, so to speak, can remain in the Company. Just like that... Come on, Mitke. I have to go now, Radovan, but you continue. - It's miscellaneous business now. - May I? Wait a minute, Comrade Director. Comrades, I wrote that letter to the Committee... not Milun. What did you say, by God? How did you become so literate? Did you type it too? Not me, but Vera. She also corrected my grammar. Let her say it. Why not type it for him, when he asked me? I didn't know he wouldn't sign it. It's not Vera's fault, nor Milun's. No one is to blame. It's not true the letter is unsigned. It says clearly, "Pal". They called me that in the resistance. Why are you playing games? Signed-unsigned? Why didn't you say? We're kicking a man out! - Why don't you say? - There... I said it. All right, Steva... What is this, people? We'll talk more about this. I'm just sorry I don't have time now. Wait, Comrade Čumić, it's different now. - This must be annulled! - Annulled how? We won't vote again about Milun, by God! We'll vote 100 times if necessary until it's cleared up! This is not valid! I think the same, Comrade Čumić. Now things have fundamentally changed. We can't expel Milun for Steva's crime. Wait, Radovan, the letter wasn't the only reason. For some, it was the main reason. - That's right! Annul this vote! - Peace, comrades, please! Please... Half an hour ago, did Milun Koprivica say in front of everyone that he would sign this letter? That's right, he did. Did he say it doesn't matter who wrote it but what was written? - That's exactly what he said. - You shut up. Did he push Trajče... and you, Sremac... and Malibrk and the entire Party Organization to prove my arbitrariness? And what did people say? What did he prove? He proved he was behind lies and slander so he was expelled from the Party. For me, it's over. What else do you want? All right about Milun. What about Steva? All right, Steva... - Why did you do it? - Well, it came to me to write it that way, so I wrote it. Why didn't you speak up at the meeting, not like this? And why don't you speak? You all know it, but stay silent! So nothing can be proven. Hell, we won't prove it that way. Everything is true, word for word. Let the commissions come and let's see. I stand behind it. So kick me out. At least I said mine. Not like this Trajče here. Well, Steva, now you'll be on the agenda too! And Vera for typing for him. Then put me on too. Not for some personal reason, comrades, because it's about Vera. I agree with Steva's letter. I told her that a moment ago. I would write worse. So where is the real principle? We expelled Milun for that letter, he didn't write it, so what now? He's right. It'll still turn out that Čumić is right. Wait, Brka, I'm not done. Write that, Vera. A while ago I voted for Milun to be expelled and now I say it was a mistake. Radovan counted me quickly and I ask that it be entered in the minutes. - What is this, Radovan? - Wait. Kosijer... I'm afraid we've taken that anonymous letter a little formalistically here. I agree with Comrade Čumić that it doesn't matter who wrote the letter, but what it says. - Of course. - But now I don't know what's true. I talked to Comrade Trajče in the yard. The man acts like a victim and it's not clear to me now whether it's true what he said here in the meeting, or outside. And it seems to me everything revolves around that case. That's what Koprivica talks about, and also Steva in his letter. So, I suggest we read Trajče's complaint to the Party Organization. All right, Kosijer. But only he can decide that. Trajče... Come on, speak... Let it be read! You're sure, Trajče? - Yes! - All right. Let's hear that too. "To the Basic Organization of the League of Communists: Dear comrades, since I was fired from the Company, I've wandered three months without a job..." It's been four months now. "I declare the following complaint, and ask you to consider my case. When it came to the merger of the Company, I did not agree with Comrade Director on these issues, so the Board of Directors was convened." What's the point of competing if we work better together? - So I'm for the merger. - That's enough! I said one thing, Trajče another! We won't get anywhere this way. But wait, Čumić. Honestly, it's still not clear to me. I said my piece. I won't talk about that merger anymore, period! And why are we here? There can't be 100 directors in one company. You're not the Director here to command, but to carry out our decisions, man! I'm responsible for this Company and I cannot and will not do otherwise. Whoever doesn't agree, let him go. What do you mean by that? You heard me. If you don't agree, go! We can't do it this way. Let's be clear, comrades. Either I have my hands free, or you find someone else. Go ahead and decide. Now say how you decided, Sremac! Was it according to your opinion? Well, I... Tell him, Sremac, and you Malibrk... Did I force you to vote against the merger? No, brother, you just explained it to us. There's no talk of any coercion. I'm my own man and I voted according to my conviction. I guess we all did. "After that, I was not even invited to the sessions and then I received notice that my position is canceled. Because I think it's wrong, I ask to be considered at the Party meeting. Yours sincerely, Trajče Maletić, worker." All right, Sremac... How did you vote for my dismissal? Was it by conviction? I don't know... Tell me, can a member of the Workers' Council be fired? Is that legal? Excuse me, Trajče, but your term has expired and the Directorate and the Board have the right... And when did my term expire? - After being fired, Comrade! - Trajče... I personally demanded that you go from the collective. And... the law doesn't apply to you, Comrade Čumić? For me, the first law is the interest of the Company. After all, you filed a complaint. What did they tell you? Yes, I complained. But what's it worth? Wherever I go, they ask Čumić. The Trade Union Commission asked to annul the dismissal, but Čumić says the collective doesn't want me. OK, Trajče, didn't I invite you to fix that thing and get back to work? I see now why you called me. You called to shut me up because you needed to fire Milun! That's why you called! - Yes. - Here, comrades... Like you, I made my living honestly with these hands. If there is no more work for me, no justice, no law, I can rot! But I don't want pity! And I won't have people say I'm a rag and a whore! It's nice that you say the interest of the Company, Comrade Čumić, but I know it's no good if a person cannot look a person in the eye. And can you look Trajče and Milun in the eye? - That's what I'm asking you. - That's right. Is it also in the Company's interest to have 100 employees and 200 officials? To spit blood to make ends meet... When there's a surplus, they toss us 2-3 thousand and full envelopes to the Directorate! Who brings more, receives more! It's economics! Why does the one who signed some contracts and sold our work get more than us, who build those facilities? You don't understand anything, Brka! If you did, you wouldn't still be a bricklayer! How can you insult him? If I'm a bricklayer, at least I can see what I built! We wouldn't last long with you in the armchair! I asked them to speak, to take a stand. Well, they're finally speaking. So that's what people think. Today this, tomorrow that. Paper remains paper. If only you planted one tree! Sorry, I didn't study to plant trees! I theorize about some material base... but what about man? Do we confuse something here, Comrade? Yes, when I only listen to Čumić and Malibrk. Radovan, what is this?! - Is this how you run a meeting? - And who's running it? You or me? Who is giving orders here? Stop now, continue now, vote now, don't vote now! When you need it, you remember! Radovan, gather communists to implement the Directorate's decision! As if the Workers' Council and the Party are here just to execute your orders! - That's right! - Exactly! Well, here are the results! - You heard them! - It's easy to criticize. No one failed from criticism, but from lack of it, Comrade Čumić. Good morning, Radovan. Good thing you woke up now. Just be careful not to lose your job too. - I don't know, comrades... - I know you don't know, it's easiest to know nothing! It's clear now that the proceedings against Trajče were illegal... - But wait... - and inhumane. You'll have your say! Milun Koprivica rightly stood up against such arbitrariness. I'm not saying he chose the best way, but I'm afraid he had no choice with us as we are. Obviously the situation in the Company is not as it should be. Interesting how you change your mind, Comrade Secretary. And you come to meetings to keep your opinions at all costs? - But one must have one's own attitude. - What do we do now, Radovan? Now some are right, then others, and there's no directive! So now you decide? The directive is to think for yourself, Comrade Jova. Quiet, comrades! Silence! Quiet. We'll stay here until morning if necessary... but we will resolve what we met for. Call Milun Koprivica back. All right, comrades. Maybe I acted too fast sometimes. But I ask you: what would have happened if I listened to Trajče and agreed to that merger? There wouldn't be a Company today. I would always find work. But where would other people go? The question is, would there be a position for Vera... or Kaća, for example. Would you, Sremac, remain head of the warehouse and wait for your pension? I wouldn't. And they're not the only ones. Every day I get 20 of them. Give me this, solve that... The whole collective, 100 people, hangs around my neck. Yes, that's right. Everyone looks for salaries and surpluses and apartments. The commune wants us to be profitable. They need money. They also have 100 problems to solve. It's not easy for me either, comrades. I don't work for my own pocket, by God! Vuk, you and yours know how to receive salaries and surpluses and you leave us mid-season to finish your private affairs. You gather the harvest... and let me rub my head with unfinished objects and unfulfilled contracts. You throw sticks and stones at me and the Directorate but how do you work? People drag themselves around construction sites seeking sick leave. Where is the Party Organization to ask that question? It asks that question of you, Čumić. Why do these people, who worked hard once, drag themselves around the work site today? Why did Steva sink so low, who we all know as a good communist, to write anonymous letters? Why did Trajče debase himself at this meeting today? I no longer recognize Kaća or Dušanka! We are fighting for man... to lift him up and teach him to manage... but you press and obstruct and don't allow. First you must know how to manage. How can people learn when you won't shut your mouth while they talk? Voja, do you remember when I joined the partisans? I couldn't say two words. Or sign my name. What would've happened if you greeted me like you did Trajče when he spoke? Look at these people, not yet here or there, not in the village or the city. Search their bags and you'd find everything. Nails and clasps and tiles. Is that right, Vuk? Until they realize it's theirs... and until they sit with us to govern and decide as equals, we're far from the goal. It's well thought out, but now it's time to bring it to life. And you obstruct. Excuse me, for whom does Comrade Koprivica speak, when he returned his Party card? I speak as a communist, Comrade Malibrk. Sit down, Malibrk. Give me a cigarette. Here you go. Do you still have a headache? Hello, comrades. Hello. Sorry I'm late, comrades. But I'm here. What's on the agenda? It looks like Comrade Čumić. Voja, I told you nicely: be careful it's not Trajče today, someone else tomorrow, and one day you too. What time is it? Ah, 11. Listen, Voja, I don't think you can do that with Trajče. Let the fool go. He's obsessed with that merger, doesn't see where it would take us. All right. I'm not for the merger either. But I guess a man can have his opinion. Why have the Workers' Council, if we solve things like that? Listen Ilija, don't philosophize with me now. I work hard, struggle to make something out of the Company, and I won't waste time with Trajče! I know, Voja, but what will the Party Organization say about that? Are you the Secretary? Are you here to help me? But he'll complain. - It could go before the Committee. - Let him complain. I know I'm right, and I'll fight to the end. No one will ask us about some Trajče, but what we created. And you, if you're scared, back off. So I'm bothering you? Come on, by God, you're sick. Heal that ulcer. You have an excuse. All right, Voja, as you wish. Just watch what you do. I'm telling you as a friend. Be careful it's not Trajče today, tomorrow someone else, and one day maybe you too. Don't worry about me. I didn't know you'd get your turn this fast. But it's good. The sooner the better. Both for you and for us. Anyway, you'll give me the floor later, Radovan. Let me state here openly: if not for Comrade Čumić, I wouldn't stay three days in this Company. Of course! And what do you want? I'll die for this Comrade Director because he's a man! - But I wouldn't lift a finger for them. - Take it easy, bro! I will die if I have to, but not for any director, but... It's clear what one dies for. But people, wait. We can't hit our Comrade Čumić like this now. He did good for us, brother. Here, I'll go first. When I became unable to work, he appointed me storekeeper until I retire. I mean... it's not easy for him either. It's no small thing to manage the Company. It's a responsibility. The problems are the same at other companies, but it's not like here. That's right, I'm not saying. And all good about Milun too. He is an honest man. - Now, if it could be fixed somehow... - Really? So the wolves are full and the goats are counted? Well, you're good, Sremac. But it won't work that way. I think it would... My position is unchanged! We expelled Milun Koprivica from the Party today and I want it to remain so. But why, when it's proven the man was right? While I'm Director here, I won't allow anyone to undermine my authority. And... so here we are... So your authority is more important than justice and truth? If that's the case, Čumić, it's you who should leave. You didn't put me in this position, you have no right to decide. These people will decide, because it's their right. Without their backing, a person has no support. People said who they were with when they voted. I voted too. But we'll vote again. All in favor of putting Comrade Čumić's case on the agenda, raise your hand. Me! And me! All right, comrades. Turn on the light. Comrades, I'd like to say something. All right. Čumić really should go. I think that is clear to him after this vote. But we also created Čumić by our silence and opportunism. I don't know if I'm clear enough, comrades... I mean, we need to talk not only about Čumić, but about all of us. That's all. I think so too. It's about us. We'll start with me, comrades... where we stopped. I think that the question was rightly asked here why I didn't come to the meeting. Bye. Paja, wait! Let's go together. Milun... Bye. Bye, Kaća. Milun... take this card. - Come on. Ilija... - Here I am. Come on, let's go to bed. Look, it's dawn. What time is it? Do you have a light?
