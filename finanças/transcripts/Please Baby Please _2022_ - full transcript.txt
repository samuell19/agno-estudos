A good solid pound. That doesn't sound so bad. I'd be just terrific, I think. I wouldn't bash someone's brains in. I wanna punch and punch and punch and punch and punch until a woman's teeth are knocked high and her gums and her jaw's hanging down, detached from her chin. I wouldn't kick a man in the ribs until his chest is flat and his heart is a flapjack. I wouldn't do that. And neither would Arthur. That's because he refuses to fight. He refuses to be a man. I won't be terrorized into acting like a savage just because I was born male. And I don't want to be rewarded for it either. He doesn't want the reward, friends. Mr. Joe Louis doesn't want his prize. I'd ask you to give it to me, but you can't. It doesn't work that way, duck. You might as well keep the title. Well, I think Arthur has it right. Men want me. Not you, Baker, my precious love. But yeah, sometimes you. And women don't bore you? Most stupid women. Oh! American women. You, Ida, are an American woman, you know that? I hope you're not suggesting that women don't endorse the male identity. In fact, you reinforce masculinity inside me daily. You wouldn't allow me to let go of it any more than another fellow would. Oh, I'm oppressing you, am I? You aren't at all interested in dominating me? I mean, what can we do as men, really? Inside the male-dominated system, inside the supreme sex class, you know, it is from ancient times. But I'll tell you, I'd like someone to be my man for once so I can relax for the weekend. Oh, yes, that's the word for it, Les. - Relax. - I'll be your man. Sure you're interested in being a man, Suze. But are you interested in growing up a boy, dragooned until you act like a boy is supposed to act? "Dragooned!" My goodness. How frightening. No, all I'm saying is all of us want to be Stanley Kowalski. I wasn't saying that. Getting a woody from our own power. Oh, Suze, perhaps a bridge too far. You're a Jewish woman! - You love to fuck. - She loves to be fucked. I maintain that we are all fucked no matter what's in our dungarees. Anyway, is all of this punching talk, this brutal Stanley Kowalski talk really appropriate? I mean, two people have been terribly hurt. Oh, they're surely dead. No, can't be. Don't doubt that. They're dead. Not dead. Arthur? Dead as the doe in Bambi. You sound delighted. She sounds orgiastic. It's out of my control. My tone. Must be the lingering effects of panic, of shock because, I mean, these hustlers, these lunatics... they know where we live. The exact apartment, 2B. Arthur's barely slept. I'm all jitters. Keep checking the lock. I walk through the door, check the lock, I walk back to the bedroom and then suddenly, I see, not Brando himself, but a Brando type and aggressor and his gang of Brandos knocking down the door. And well... Well? Well, I don't know what happens when they get inside, but it's a wild image, really. And it's the only image in my whole head. Hey, Arthur, you want to play some sides? Yes, give us some sounds. Arthur's had his cage rattled. Look at the deer. Oh, he's just a slob of a wet rag tonight, aren't you, duck? Come on. Tell 'em. Some men are the kind of men other men fear. Some men are the kind of men other men want to hold tight in a friendly embrace, unafraid. Some are sissies for bullies. Some are real sports who play along. But the world of men is always one of comparison and measurement! I'm perceiving myself right now in contrast to the two men in this room and in contrast to the two women also. Am I enough of a man? Is my attempt to be more of a man pitiful and obvious? I feel threatened by all four of you, by, by both your sexes, your, your collective sexitness. Ow.

I admit it's amazing the things I don't know about you. Now, stand up. Come, kiss my neck. No. No. No, no, no. I want to worship you. I want to... I want to be beneath you. I want to be here on the floor at your feet, kissing your feet. Play along, Arthur. Play easy to get, won't you? I'm gonna... I'm gonna pull you up. Yes. Pull me up. Give me French kisses! Everyone thinks we're just great. Everyone loves us. The last of the greats. I want to eat a fuckin' hamburger. Hmm. Hey. I've decided to let you be the crybaby about all of this! Help me. Come on, help me. Come on. No doormat. I don't know how you live. I mean, of course, you are 2B, but I'm 10F. Help me, my goodness. Yes. So, come on, Susan. What, what do you want me to do? Help a neighbor. This must be what purgatory is like. Always a flight of stairs beneath a beautiful woman never able to catch up to her. But what would happen when you reach her? I mean, where would you be then? Heaven? Or someplace else? Join me. Come on. Are you famous? I ought to be famous. But I'm just married. Right. But I'm married, too. Yeah. I've seen your husband. Where have you seen him? You spy all that junk out there? I myself am not interested in all that junk. I want a piece of art. Fine art. Something big and messy, takes up the whole wall. Something abstract, you know? I was waiting at the artist studio all day today. Had a nice, sloppy one picked out. Then I started thinking, "Where's Daddy?" And do you know where he was at the last? He was at Gimbel's, buying me another cold plug-in box. Another stand-in for a man but more powerful, harder. Poor dope doesn't even realize that I'm surrounded by gigantic vibrators. Just doesn't fit this apartment, I'm sorry. These are the slums, and I'm a slum starlet, and it's as crummy and miserable as all that. I saw two people get murdered on our stoop last night. Yes, it's exactly like that. Ostentatious, showoff-y. I don't want this junk. I'm a wife. But I'm no wifey. You know, wifey with a smile across your face and a trick up your sleeve. Submissive, yet controlling. You know the type. I don't have a television. Babe. Billy, my love! Use the hidden key. Yes, but where's it hidden, Maureen? Try the plant. No... Try the rock. The big boy right there. Oh, those aren't for us girls. There's no key out here, Maureen. Your husband doesn't have his own key? Daddy doesn't need a key. He needs a map. That's Billy. He's taking me out. Your husband take you out? Sure. When we get there, he doesn't really want to talk to me. What am I thinking? Mel has the hidden key. Oh, poor Billy. Hold on! Hold on! Where's Arthur, I wonder? He's in bed. Oh. Who's bed, I wonder? Doesn't matter. Hand me my purse. Your husband's tender, right? He doesn't want to own you. He just wants to love you, right? You've done your best to find a sensitive type, an artistic soul. He'd never knock you around. That's exactly what you wanted, isn't it? Somebody gentle. Here. But, but men are the executors of history. They're the doers. The performers, you know? They instigate. They disrupt. They fuck. Now none of us want a goon. I mean, none of us want an oaf. But what if you just want to get a little choked? You know, just a little choked. Not too tight. Just, you know, for fun. Baby, please. Problem with pleasures. What do you do for leisure? Well, you can't have it both ways with men, can you? Can you? It's the wrong key, darling! The wrong key, you dummy! What did I give him, the key to my hope chest? Geez. Here. Just take the whole batch. You like all this junk? I've never even seen a dishwasher. I must have washed 20 dishes tonight. Maybe 25. Swell. All right. Here's the plan. You know when you're a kid and you have this idea of trouble? You know, like, thinking you're in trouble with your mama or pops? Well, it's the worst thing imaginable. And then you grow up, you become a woman. And who's left to get in trouble with? Somehow with all of that being true, I've still got myself in some trouble. But don't you worry about me because I'm gonna be in Europe. You're going to take the key from Billy on your way out. I'll jet, and you'll feed Taffeta. She's a Burmese, a very fussy little puss. Oh, I don't like cats. Arthur says because I'm basically a cat, like, I hate water and other cats and all dogs. Oh, well, she's a beast. She's a terror. And you are gonna hate her good. And you can use any of these clunky old sex toys. All right, you want one of those muscle rags? - Dummy. - Oh, no. Arthur isn't interested in physical fitness. Well, we'll just give them all to Billy. He'll love us forever. There you go. Harder, harder. Come on. Come dance with me. Thought you like bunnies. Sure do. How about puppies? Yeah, I do. And how about a little baby bear cub? Bears are just horrible. I hate bears. All right, well, there's no bears here. Look, see? There's no bears here. All right? Now go on. Take it. It's yours. You can have it. I like your pictures. All right, well, turn around so I can blow you a little kiss. Just one little kiss. Hey, blow me a kiss back. Come on, blow me a kiss back. Come on. Hey, blow him a kiss, you dumb tramp. Bring your tight ass back over here and buy him a drink. - Come on. - Let's go! - Let's go! - Come on, let's go! I know you. Clarinet Clyde, 2B. 2B. ♪ 2B, 2B, one, doo-doo, 2B one ♪ Where's baby tonight? Tell-tale nightingale. Nowhere? Hey, Beanie, you're gonna play dead? My, um, uh, c... clarinet's... It's broken now. Hmm. Shame. Enticing eyes, nimble fingers. It was my father's. Me, I'm fatherless. Create a certain weakness, some say. I'm like that Wheeler wasp, you know, an etiological non-entity. I don't want any... William Wheeler, man, the ethologist. He watched the male wasp forever and ever and found nothing, no behavior. I mean it. No way of being at all. Well, that's not you. Men get away with everything. But I'm not interested in getting away with anything. Well, murder. Quite, you with your brave mask. I broke the clarinet. Maybe I'll break the clarinet player. Suze is at home. Where she should be. I wouldn't say that. You didn't. I'm just saying I'm alone tonight. And you're with your band? Less of a band than a pack of hungry hound dogs ruled by a... How does a guy become a young gent? You know, you get born in the... symptom of a sickness in society. Hey, 2B. It's Arthur. Hey, Arthur. You a good sport? Sport? I meant, can you keep something like a secret? Which secret? It's all a secret. Ice it is what I'm saying. I don't want to get away with anything either. Well, marriage. You don't know Suze. What's to know? You're circle now, and that's Suze is trouble looking for trouble. And now my band's out there tuning up, and we're headed for a fight. It's just a battle you're fighting within yourselves. You put me in a real mood. So I'll, I'll see you again? Will you? ♪ 2B, 2B one... ♪ Please, baby, please. Now I will patiently wait for someone to pack me in a box and ship me to the past. They do things differently there. The past. Well, the problem of my personality can seem wondrous again. Meet me at the Heaven on Earth building near the Manhattan Bridge. Take the dirty taxicab with the chewing gum on the seat. Let it remind you that I'm not the only thing stuck inside something hard and unmoving. I only ever wanted to know what you were thinking and if you were thinking of... Shh! ...a plastic bag parked on a thorny rose bush, which is to say needs... No, stop playing. Stop playing. Stop playing. But you said there was going to be dancing, Dickie, I want to go. Let's just go. The girl wants to leave. She don't know what she wants. You said there was gonna be a band. Yeah, you're looking at a band. Bands play music. I know that, you chimpanzee. Okay, look, I'm the sensitive sort. I want to hear poetry being read to me. Well, maybe I don't want such a sensitive sort. Maybe I want a big old brute. I think you are the brute. Hey, hey, you gonna cause a real scene here, kids. Yeah, well, we're looking for a real scene. All right, come on, man, just read the poem. How about that... I like that heaven and earth business. Why don't... Why don't you just read it, okay? You're not hearing, my friend. He's telling you that you are agitators. He's saying you have no etiquette. Look, I don't know where you all come from, but you don't look so upper crust to me. Oh, we're poor like you. Just educated. I'm not poor, Dickie. We're not dumb. And why would a sensitive soul like you be looking to pick a fight? Because I'm misunderstood! Just read the poem, okay? But start from the beginning. I want to hear the stuff about... about the gum stuck on the yellow cab. Dickie, I want to dance. I wasn't gonna hit you. No, stop. Don't hide from me. Look at me. I'm sensitive. I'm a gentleman. Hey, how did you know about tonight? Who invited you? We're friends of Arthur's. Arthur, who's this kid? Yeah, Arthur, help us out here. I said we're friends. You don't got to push it. He's one of them street killers, ain't he? He's in that street gang. Yeah. Let's go back. Give the boys a while longer. Well, you just might end up with that sock in the eye you've been asking for. Maybe I want to be feared. Maybe I want to be imposing. Yeah. Impressive. Ida, tell me, how does a woman get respected? Easy. Just be very boring. Men respect anything that bores them. I've been having these fantasies. Fantasies where you smash open a guy's head with a bottle of Schlitz? See, this is where you're all backwards. We are the fantasy. We're smart. We like to get off. We don't got to mince or whimper or hop around in high-heeled shoes to get our way. We're choice. I sure want a more important job than making Arthur happy. Your importance to Arthur has far more to do with how much you can hurt him than how happy you can make him. What is our marriage then? A strange sort of friendship that started out with a few sexual privileges? Yeah. That's marriage. Well, I'm through being sexy. Ugh... How long can anyone be sexy for anyway? Even men. Although they'll always have debonair. Heh, I'm sorry... Never have debonair. If I was a man, I'd buy a leather jacket. Nice and tough. Well, I am definitely a woman, and I certainly enjoy it. I especially enjoy female friendships. All that flattery and flirting, gushes of lies, and lovely words that don't mean a thing. Thrilling sport. I mean what I say to you. When? Please, help! Give me a dime. I need a fucking dime for love. Street corner. Filled with fantasy. You want to bet she'll change his mind? No. Please, no. No. I'm sorry. I don't have plans and schemes.

I never told him I wanted to be alone. I only told him I wanted to be left alone. Isn't that different? That's probably just kids. Bunch of boys. What were you like as a boy? Um, same as now. Does anyone really ever change? Of course. I'm always changing. I'd like to be someone else entirely. It's a frightening thing to hear from one's wife. You'd rather me be anyone else in the whole entire world, never, ever? Well, um, that's, that's not the same thing. We're talking about you being you while also evolving, not about substituting you with another person. We're talking about Suze as she is, not about actual magic. Arthur, play the game, won't you? No, I don't feel like being put under extreme pressure tonight. You're angry with me. I told you I wasn't. Only you don't believe me. You love me then? I'm... I'm sensitive to atmosphere. No. You know I love you. That's implied. But we can't do something completely out of character and expect me to understand. So you good on me then? I love you for now, Suze. But I'm getting real nervous about the you that's coming. But you'll change, too. - Into what? - I don't know. We'll change into each other. Isn't that what happens? Oh, no. Suze! I'm walking downstairs. I don't care at all! You care that I'm asking you not to? All show and no go! They would have killed us already if they wanted. We know that. Thinking we're thicker than a Five Dollar Molly, but we're not. You're looking for a fist in the face, Suze. I'm the king around here, and don't you forget it. Suze? I'm the king around here, and don't you forget it! I'm the king around here, and don't you forget it. They've been... They gave us a real working over. Your pad just seemed like a hiding kind of pad. Can we hide in here with you for a while? They weren't even there. Must have... Time to split, Teddy. It's not such a palace. My keys... My keys! Arthur! I feel I should be invited to sit down. Billy. Ugh, I am surely on the make, and there is absolutely nothing doing. Seemed like maybe I was here on the wrong night, and then I run into you two. And, um, well, maybe that's not for nothing. You on a sweetheart date? Arthur brought me. Oh... Saw the address in the back of a matchbook, thought we'd like it. Call me old-fashioned, but I love when a man takes the lead. Oh, well, that's not Arthur. Well, then Arthur's a bum. You know, it might sound corny to you, but Arthur refuses to be a man. Well, Arthur, if you're not a man, what are you? I... I am a man. I just don't feel the need to act male. It's hard to believe I was even born male. Heh. I've never been enough of a genuine man to suggest I am one. So maybe I'm not one. Boy, what a kick. But you're not a woman. You're not a woman, Arthur. Of course he's not a woman. Gak. Here's a question for you, Billy. Hmm. What is a man, anyway? Ooh, ring a ding, ding, ding. Well, I suppose we could start with an inspection of the groin. No, I, I think that's baloney. It's not only expected that I identify with other men, but it's also implied I'm not allowed to identify with women. I can't share any of their feelings or interests because we're supposed to be opposites. Well, what about fucking? I mean, doesn't fucking make you feel like more of a fucking man? Sometimes it feels like Suze is inside of me. Mm. You know, I have a terrific theory on this. And some blue night, I'm gonna tell you all about it. No, tell us now. We want to hear the theory right now! No, you bossy little cow. We'll buy you a drink. Do I look like I want to spend my night teaching a dip and his dyke how to be cool? Good night, Billy. Oh, no, no, no, no. No. Let's have another gin rickey and Arthur will dance with you. Planet Manhattan to Saturn Suzy, your husband's here for someone else. I knew that. Well, if you know that, then... what are you two doing living the big lie? We love each other. Oh, boy. Oh, that is a tickle. Sit down, sister! I am not your sister, mister. And he doesn't act like a woman. He acts like a queer. Same for you. We put in our appearances! We put in our parts our whole lives. We are art, Arthur. I'd buy us and I'd hang us on a wall. Man and wife, 1956, Who would... Who would buy that? Listen, Joanne, you said you'd be our eye roll. All right, the only reason the Gents let you come along is 'cause this is your pop's car, so you got to can it. You got to take all your tears, and you got to throw 'em in the ash can. You hear me? You're degenerates! You're apes! Hey! If they're apes, then I'm an ape. Why did you even like me in the first place? You know, you know I was a tense young man. You know I was tough to get to the center of. But that's what a girl does, Dickie. She makes a pretty poodle out of a salty dog. I mean, you're around now, but you're gonna change. Either you're both deluded or everyone in the human race is deluded. You can't make a Mickey Mouse eat. If you did, you'd drop him. Sure thing. Dickie, stand up for me. Tell him. This is just like Bev. This is exactly, like, Swanky Bev in a real mansion. Yeah. Yeah, Bev kept saying there's no such thing as a real man. Like, guys all got together and made the whole thing of being guys up... Like, I was a goof wearing some man mask trying to outdo everyone. Like, we was all trying to outdo each other. Not just the Young Gents, but also all the men, all of them, everywhere. She wanted a father. Boy, did she ever. Well, what's feeling real, anyway? No, Teddy, you're a true blue. You're a sappy honeybee. You got a girl? Dickie, shut her up. How about this? You boys love a competition, right? You want to win a prize, isn't that so, and prove to each other who's best? How about we have a game, a do or die, and whoever wins get something even better from my pops than his car parts? How about... his wristwatch? How about his daughter? The watch is fine. What's the game already? Simple. You have to open yourself up. You have to say something honest. You have to be vulnerable and tender with your feelings. Whoever does it best wins. You got smog in your noggin'. How are you gonna judge a thing like that? We're not your damn girlfriends. I'll do it. I want to do it. Don't. Dickie will go first. Dickie, say that thing that you were saying the other night... about how all of you are fighting against the punishing world and about how none of you ever grew up really, instead, you just merged together like a pack of animals because, because you knew there was something about other men you had to protect yourselves from? I wasn't really saying that, Joanne. I'm going first. There's a scale I know you're all rating me on and now you got me rating myself on it, too. A scale for belonging. I'm... living based on where I stand on this fake fucking scale because I'm obsessed with a lot of you. I'm terrified of each of you. I'm in agony that I don't size up to any of you because you're all the standard of the kind of man I got to appear to be. Oh... No! You two are already done. Now you want to drop dead twice? Sweet Dickie. Sweet Dickie and lovely Joanne. - Get us our keys back. - Now, can't you see you're playing with the lowliest of the lot? They're gonna take everything you have and make it their own. Me? I don't want what I don't got. But you two aren't dealing with me. How about a deal though? We don't have anything worth anything, but I know someone who does, same building too. Sure you like right off the sales floor at Gimbel's. Plus, they're in Europe. Maybe even forever. How about their keys for ours? Swaps. She's lying, Teddy. The only thing we've got in the whole world is the person sitting across from us. And all we know in the whole world is whatever that person says. I'll see about your swap. Find you later. Don't you find me. Hmm. Okay... "Find you later. Don't you find me." Terrific. Maureen's not upstairs. I know where Maureen's not better than you. I like your get-up, stud. Well, look, you're not getting my red roses. Move. Just tell me your blue night's theory. Just tell me that blue night's theory of yours. That's all. That's it. We are living on a dying planet filled with impossible obstacles. Billy baby, get up here. ♪ Baby, please ♪ ♪ Please ♪ ♪ Baby, please ♪ ♪ Please ♪ ♪ Please ♪ No, don't come. Don't come.

Suze and I are in the middle of something here, and if I knew what it was, I'd tell you, but I don't. You are just moping around, sitting there like a pole. You remember what a happy boy you were? No. Son, it is our troubled minds that make us so good at playing the root on our licorice sticks. We're just the same that way. Arthur is an outsider. What's the matter with him? Is he... too wrapped up in himself? Should we just count him out for good from now on? Is it because he looks different? Is it some particular way he acts? If he can just make up his mind not to be an always outsider, then the gang will easily accept and invite him in. Sure. That sounds swell. I want to be a happy boy. I don't have to certify my sex to either sex. I want to feel comfortable in the company of men without having to prove that I'm a caveman and I've... I've done that job, haven't I? I got married, didn't I? I'm a... I'm a tenderhearted husband, aren't I? I, I love my wife, don't I? I'm gonna, I'm gonna die in her arms. Won't I? Won't I? Won't I, Dad? Dad? Will I? No, Arthur, I tell you, it's not so tragic as all of that. But of course, we're all walking tragedies, all us guys. "What a piece of work is man," huh? Hamlet. All right, you know the rest of it. I'm gonna go follow my wife. I wouldn't suggest it. And I won't tell your mother anything. 'Night, son. Man delights not me. No. Nor woman neither. I got a stub. Ticket for a show maybe?

Hey, can you just let me peek a head in? I want to see if there's someone in there that I know. Hmm... You look just like my husband Arthur. Hmm. Poor Arthur. Give me two dollars to peek your head in. Before, it was $1.15 before. Oh, you're in there to bite. Dollar fifteen for boys and two dollars for girls. Hey, do you mind telling me if you know a guy named Teddy? Usually wears a leather jacket with the words "Young Gents" on the back. Is that your husband? Yeah, he is. Does he know you're a boochie? Heh. I'm not though. Heh. Yeah. So what'd your husband do to have you chasing him down here? Unless down here is the reason why you're chasing him. This constant desire to couple. It's so strong. It's like constant companionship. And then you forget yourself, the self, you know? Couple up to forget about the condition of being human and all the pains, plus how damn difficult it is to survive. Hmm... My husband, uh, Teddy, he's been so gentle with me, even when I wanted to be rough with him. How am I ever gonna give it to him the way he wants to get it? I'm gonna ask him. Hey, are you writing a book here? Take a quick peep around, Warden. None of these Joe Does want to talk to you. They don't even like gals. They're not here to flirt. Hey, do you know a guy named Teddy? The Young Gents. You heard of that? I know those degenerates. You do? Do you know Teddy? Do you know if he's coming here tonight? I don't know Teddy from Freddy from Serengeti. But, boy, did I hand it to one of 'em just last month. Sure messed 'em up bad. Still makes me a little, you know, sick to think about it. You should really beat it. No fooling, miss. I'm just gonna wait here for Teddy, thank you. What's your bag, man? You're not hearing me. You're sitting in a room full of criminal queers. I'm gonna blow my whistle in five seconds. You're gonna want to cut out in three. Do I look like a bear? Or do I look like a pig? Run! Run! Run! Run! Caught you. I... um, I caught you following me. Following her. That bunny lives to hop. Yeah. She thinks she's the big dick solving some kind of great whatsit. Yeah, white hot thrills. Well, I don't got her keys, though I do have her man. Um... what y'all did to that girl was deranged. What's deranged? It's, it's like whacko. Like unzipped. Say, want to lose control? I'm, I'm, um... I'm, I'm not in control. You know, there's playing it cool and then there's just... being cool. Yeah. Um, I, I play the clarinet. Play me. Play with me. See how I wail. Who made you? Angel or devil? You got to draw a line. So you know where the line is... when you cross it. You ever crossed it, bean? Maybe for one of those boys in your band? No. Um... I never gave them a second thought. You ever given them a first thought? Teddy, angel, you don't have to be a killer. At least I'm not an artist, stiff. I am stiff. You could be my favorite. Favorite favorite? Oh, it'll pass. Said the crying man to his subway train. Geez, Teddy. Suze... you're my wife. And you're a wondrous thing. We're not squares, we're someone else. But I'm on the hook for you, and you're on the hook from me. And we can love, like, crazy, like wow! We just have to figure it out. We're gonna figure this all out together, and then it's gonna be unreal. Suze? Hey, Suze? I'm home, duck. Come to bed, will you? Did you lock the door? What's the fucking point in locking the fucking door? ♪ Please, baby, please ♪ Arthur! So, Arthur, how's that clarinet? Still broken? - Still broken. - Still broken. Tell your old man you broke his piece, get in loads of trouble. We're grownups. There's no such thing as trouble. Then stop punishing us. I'll do whatever I want 'cause I'm a wild one. Yeah, wild and free. Heart and ribs like bird and cage. When it flutters, set it free. No one's trying to lick you into shape, Susan dear. I think we're all just very lucky that the sharpest knife on the table's for spreading jam. Yeah, I think Ida's saying we don't need all the... the, the friction. Let her say what she's saying. I'm saying, screw. Suze, you deviant, answer that. Arthur, you sap, answer your door. Snobs, sit down. Don't you go showing off, for you're the big shot. Just give us the number of that hotsie apartment with all the fancy shit in it. I don't think you ought to. Ought to what? Bust your bitch wife in the nose? Ah, it's 10F. Get off it already. You two, with me upstairs. Watch 'em. I saw Liz Taylor at the Bijou 52. She was wearing a fur coat. I saw Monty Clift. They were on a date. I watched two boys wrestling underwater. There was a bust with the cops. I don't know what kind of mixed up you are, but whatever itch you got to scratch, do it on some other guy's ding some other the night. Hey! Zip it. Missus, take your heinie over here. Hi, Dickie. Hiya, Suze. Hiya, poets. Psst. They're gonna be up there a while, lots of stuff, lots of big, big old, heavy high-ticket items. We're in no... rush. Let me go to the restroom. No. You'd have done better if you headed to a national park and marrying a grizzly. There's no way she has a muffin in her pants. Scram! Aw, shh, Dickie. Shh. You're all right. You're a healthy, well-balanced, young gentleman. You're okay. He killed that darling Joanne, didn't he? You've been asking for it. We'll handle him later. Ice it. Keep it like a secret. Okay, bean? Hear me? Arthur, he just wanted us to be scared of his manhood so he wouldn't be scared of ours. Oh, hold me, Dad. Daddy, Daddy. Daddy. Dad... Daddy. Oh, Daddy.
