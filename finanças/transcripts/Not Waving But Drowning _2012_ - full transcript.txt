Jack "big guy" Fitch is trying to crack his teeth. Like in Antarctica... Where if you believe what big guy tells you... everybody has cracked teeth. They're out in the cold all day, and they get in and gulp down hot coffee to get warm. Big guy's been my best friend for as long as I can remember. And they crack pieces of their teeth right off. But this is a new big guy, a bafflement to us all. The old one collected stamps. He wore shorts. He ate sandwiches with a knife and fork. So, what do you say? Oh... I don't know. I don't know what I say. That was before his mother died. She died eight days ago. She did it herself. Come up here. This is from the rope. This is where she did it. Any place I hang myself is home. In the movie version, this is where his father would have slapped him. But he didn't. Didn't slap him. Didn't even hear him. But big guy's father has probably heard what big guy says about the cubs. It's the funniest thing he can imagine. It's what he doesn't have to imagine because his father really said it. In the silence after big guy heard the news, his father had added... And what's more, the cubs lost. So, you see, it's not as if the cubs lost. At my house, big guy is the man of the house. Tuna fish... your favorite, big guy. Thanks, Ann. There's pink lemonade and m-i-k. The phrase my mother uses. In school, we were forced to watch this sex-ed video called "the most girl part of you." I went directly home and told my mother that Jack and I weren't doing anything. And she responded with... More's the pity. In other words, it's all she can do to keep from dimming the lights for us. What do you need to learn to sew for? Uh... It's a surprise. All right. I'll show you. You know what I brought my mom to eat that day? A melted-cheese sandwich? Yeah. Do you want to know what the last thing I said to her was? What? I said, "mom, guess what all the" kids at school have." What do they have? Sunglasses. And... she said, "save your" money." The last thing I had said to. Mrs. Fitch was that I liked her hair. Close your eyes. No. You're gonna do something. Come on, come on, come on. Just close them. And... Open. Big guy, what did you do? Does that hurt? No. I bet I wouldn't have to glue my seamstress badge on. I reason that if he left it here, he wanted me to see it. Hey, Amy. Oh, god. You did it. No need to go to Antarctica. From ice water? Uh, no. My bike collided with a garbage truck. Actually, it wasn't an accident. You left these at my house. So, this girl from my school is throwing a party tomorrow, and I thought that you might want to go, too. With me. You're gonna go out in public like that? Uh, I wish. But my dad's making me get it fixed. Too bad. It's becoming. So, you'll come?

This is what it looks like now after a horrific chain-reaction crash starting at about 4:30 this morning. State troopers, firefighters, and paramedics are still combing through this tangled mass of cars and trucks and tractor trailers that continue to litter the interstate. Exceptionally heavy fog and smoke from a 500-acre controlled burn just off the interstate made for a deadly combination. 14 people are confirmed dead, as many as 50 vehicles were involved, including seven tractor trailers that caught on fire. 14 miles of i-4 are closed in both directions from U.S. 27 to the polk parkway. We're hearing 50 plus, 14 confirmed dead, several people were injured and transported by medical helicopters to hospitals in Orlando and tampa... [ The Cranberries' "dreams" [ plays ] So, I go out with some people from my work last night. You don't work there anymore. And we ended up at. St. Mike's, and of course I get, like super drunk, and long story short, I end up at. Brandon's house. Brandon. As in 20 years older than you with a wife and kids? I'm having a crisis of conscience. You did not make it with him? What?! No. Wait, what was the question? Yes. Well, halfway. Adele! Adele, that is horrible. Where was his wife? She was at a cheerleading competition. Oh, god. I know. It doesn't really get worse than that. But I think they're getting a divorce though, so that's good. Well, I'm glad that you could be a part of that. What? Jesus, Sara. I feel like shit already. I don't need you... I know. I know. I'm sorry. It's just... that sucks for his family, you know? Yeah. Yeah, of course I know. And that's why, somewhere in the middle of it, I did sober up and I-I took off, you know? I bolted. And I started walking, and I started thinking about what an idiot and a bitch and just, like, a terrible person and just a total slut I am. Stop. You're not a slut. I mean, I don't know. It's kind of like that part in "my best friend's wedding" when she is talking about the pond scum and it, you know, feeding on itself. You know that part? Oh. That's me... pond scum. Well, that's kind of what you look like too. Ha. Ha. God, I can't wait to get out of this place. We have to look at apartments tonight. We cannot stay with Andy. This is our revolution summer. It's gonna change everything. Give me your hand. I'm driving, Adele. Come on, give me your hand. Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me. Okay, look at me. No. Look at me, Sara! Jesus... Look at me! Jesus, okay! Close your eyes. No! This is going to change everything. Close your eyes. God! You are so weird. I will not have you hate on the revolution. I'm just trying to keep us alive here. Oh, we are young and invincible. I read that... In a magazine somewhere. It had something to do with insurance. I like those two words together. Oh! Oh. Oh, I love you girls. Mom... Mom, you've got something gooey hanging on the end of your nose. Oh! I'm sorry. Oh, I've just been so worried. I didn't know what else to do except sit here and pray that you were going to walk through that door. Worried about what? Oh, that accident. What accident? You mean you didn't see it? No. Surely you must have passed it. There were 15 cars involved. The announcer said it was mostly people going into work in Orlando. Oh, Sara, your father is a wreck. Wait, how did you know about it? I saw it on the news at the diner. And you failed to mention it the entire car ride home? I don't know. Wait, why? What does this have to do with dad? Well, they did a controlled burn up on 98 last night. The smoke got so bad they had to close the road. He and Keith road out there this morning to make sure they were safe, and he called in the clearance to open it up. And then a huge accident happened. Well, that's not his fault. Well, no, but he sure feels like it was. I talked to Matty. It's not good. Mom? Mom? Richard? Hey, hey. I put a goddamn dollar in the machine. Keith, Keith, calm down. Are you okay? All right. Settle down. It's just a dollar, okay? Okay. What did you do? Two! Thank you, Sara. Keith... oh, no. What's going on? I can't find Damon. Yeah, we just got done talking to the families. It's been pretty hard for him. He'll be all right. Dad? Dad? Daddy? Are you okay? I think my sister hates me. She doesn't hate you. She's just sad you're leaving. No, I really think she hates me, though. Last night, I was at my grandma's house and... okay, Adele, I have to tell you something. And I'm really sorry. It's really bad. Okay. What's up? Okay. I can't go to New York with you. Wait, seriously? Yes, seriously. But, wait. We have tickets and we're going this weekend. It's... it's done. I don't understand. What happened? My dad, isn't doing... what does this have to do with your dad? He doesn't want me to go anymore. What, like, not now or ever? Not for a while. You are ridiculous. You will find any excuse not to do something that makes you even the slightest bit scared. You know this affects me, too, right? So what? That's just it? I don't know. I should have known this was gonna happen. Oh, god. What are you doing here? I just came by to... Why are you smoking? I don't know. I was bored and mad, kind of. That's a good reason, I guess. Sucks, doesn't it? It's not so bad. Okay, so... I'm really sorry for being mean earlier and I overreacted and I know that I did that. It's okay. But it's not like you're never coming, you know? You just got to, like, sort out this family situation. Yeah. I mean, I don't feel like me staying is gonna make any difference. But my mom thinks it's too much at once, you know? Maggie... she's always cramping my style. It's what she does best. I can't believe you're not coming with me tomorrow. I know. I feel like I have been living my whole life like I'm waiting for the real thing to start. And now I feel like it's so far away, like it's never gonna happen. You got to make it happen, Sara. I know I do. Mm-hmm. I'm gonna save up and try to make it by the end of the summer. You mean by the end of the revolution? That, too. Let's go to the park!

Oh, actually, I need to talk to you about that, Sara. About what? Your dad doesn't think it's a great idea for you to be driving right now. What? What do you mean? Well, he's been meaning to take a look at your car. He's just a little nervous, you know, 'cause it's so old. Well, since when? Well, how am I supposed to get to work? It's my first day.

You asshole, I've been sitting here, waiting for you. Well, I'm here now. Okay. Can we go in, please? They're very similar looking keys, so... Oh. Wait, that one sort of worked. You'd think that, but you don't live here. Did you have a good night? You had a good night tonight, huh? Same as every night. What did you do? Um, I, uh, went with friends. Mm-hmm. And then I met this sort of stand off-ish girl. A big part of your job will be maintaining order in this hall. Maintaining order? Are there a lot of nursing-home brawls? Sara, I do hope you'll take this job seriously. By order, I mean balance. Keep tabs on the residents. Make sure that they have what they need. I'm sorry, but, um, does it smell a little bit like marijuana in here? That is Sylvia, one of our more... difficult residents. I'm just really frustrated. What? Why? Colin and Andy are never around and their apartment is horrible and I can't even take a shower and... I don't know. Mm, I think someone told you that would be the case. What's happenin'? I see you there, sexy girl. What's happenin'? Girl, girl, you're sexy. But, Sara, honestly, I didn't know people lived like this. I'm actually living in squalor. Squalor? Yes! Why don't you just clean it up? I know you want me to say it. Say what? Okay, fine. You were right. Oh, that! Yes, yes, I guess I was. Shut up. Well, if it makes you feel better, they're making me teach an art class at the old folks' home. What?! Why? You don't know anything about art. I know, I know. I-I do not get it either.

Do you want to come up for a little bit? Hi. Hi. Thank you so much for having me come up. I'm Adele. Kim. Nice to meet you. God, your apartment is a dream. Thanks. I like it. No, seriously, like, I dream about apartments, and I'm pretty sure I've dreamt of this one. Not happy with your current living situation? Um, You have no idea. Well, they should at least give you a key, right? Oh, yeah, you know what? Actually, like, right now, I don't really want one, because then it feels, like, permanent, and I like that it feels, like, really temporary, you know? No, I get it. I actually have to go. Oh. Yeah.

So today, we're gonna be doing free association. Just don't think too much, and let the brush take over the page. Bah! I don't want to paint. His chair is stuck. He's been there since bingo. Normally Sammy helps him out, but they got in a fight. Well, since you're here, I think you should paint. Uh, sometimes with free association, you can even close your eyes and just let the brush connect with the canvas. Can we make friendship bracelets? Um maybe next week, but not today. I'd like to bedazzle some jeans for my granddaughter. Do you have a bedazzler? Harold! Harold, you're painting. That's very good. It looks really... um, Harold. Please don't paint on... You're painting on the table, Harold. Harold, you're painting on the table. Please stop. Please stop painting on the table, Harold. Harold. Harold! Please stop! Thank you, har... Harold. It was horrible. Terrible. Horribly terrible. Ah, you're just being over-dramatic. That's my job, honey bee. Why won't you come, Sylvia? That's Eileen's territory. What? Who's Eileen? Well, don't tell her I said this, but she is the only other half classy babe in this joint. So, you two avoid each other? There can't be two queen bees, so we split the hive. But she didn't even come, so this could be your territory. Of course she didn't come to the class. It's a brand-new class. Oh, nursing-home politics. You're ridiculous. Although, I would enjoy an art class. I used to paint, you know. Big, sensual things. Well, good. You'll come next week, then. And now, a little something to make you feel a little better. Ah. A little music and... Tada! Sylvia, I can't smoke that. I'm working. Suit yourself. Uh, do you have retail experience? Yeah, I worked at an express for like six months. Um, no. No? No like you're not hiring right now? No, we're not hiring... You. This is all very "pretty woman" of you. So, who's the new friend? Should I be jealous? Yes. Jerk. It's this girl who lives in the building next to me. I am really awkward around her though, because I kind of have a girl crush on her. Oh, I hate that. I know. It's the worst. Well, I have a new friend too. Oh. Over or under 65? Over. Hello, everyone. Good afternoon. You must be Sammy. You heard it here first! Sammy... So today, we're gonna do something really fun. Art isn't always about creating something new. It's also about transformation. Transforming something that you already have... maybe it's something that you don't like but you want to. Can I paint my ex-wife? So, why don't you take a quick trip back to your rooms and get something that you want to transform. And Esther... Oh! Sammy, I need help. I know. Push, push, push. Yeah, that's all I mean to you... the guy that pushes you around. Push me around. Watch those corners, Sammy! Are you gonna come back with your ex-wife? I'd have to dig her up first. Whoo! Here we go! I thought there was supposed to be a class in here now. Uh, yeah, there is. They'll be back in a minute. Um, what are those for? You know, literature for the home, pamphlets, brochures, shit people throw away. Oh. Do you want to come back? No. Those will be fine. What? So, what was class today? Um, we painted things in our lives that we wanted to change. Ah. You know, I've always hated these walls. Why is everything so... Pastel? Yeah. Pastel. Ugh. Well, I think joy would kill you if you painted the walls. Well, then, uh, it's decided. Oh, my... oh, my god. Is this you in New York? Mm, indeed it is. Who is this, hmm? He's so handsome. It was the night we broke up. Really? I mean, you look happy, though. It's easy to look happy. You should take it. What? Yeah. No way. No. What do I need them for? You take them. What about posterity? What about your family? I mean, Sylvia, these are... These are you. Honey, I have no family to speak of. The minute I go, all those photos are going into the garbage, so take them. What? Oh, no. What in the world? Let's do all of them... your whole life. You want to put all the old pictures of me all over the walls? Mm-hmm. No. Hi, friend! It's like getting a hold of the pope. I know, I'm sorry. I've been meaning to call you back. Yeah, yeah. Adele, I taught an art class today, and they didn't revolt. Really? That's awesome! I know! Oh, my god. Oh, shit, Sara. Hey, actually, I have to go. I'm going out with that girl I was telling you about, and she's calling me right now. Oh, cool. Where are you guys going? Um... I'm not sure. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? Oh, yeah. Duh.

Have you? Uh, just the other day, but she got off kind of quick. What do you think she's doing right now? Something glamorous. You think? I don't know. I hope so. Mm. I thought you were mad at her. It's no fun to be mad. Dad? Why aren't you at work? I just decided to take the rest of the day off. What are you doing under there? Just making sure this old clunker's safe.

So, how was your big night? Oh, it was... it was great. We went to, like, a lot of really cool places. Great. I played scrabble with mom. She won. You should call your sister. Yeah, I know. I-I've just been avoiding that. She misses you. Yeah, right. Plus I think I'd rather her just imagine me here. I'm sure she thinks I'm doing something a lot cooler than I actually am. More glamorous? Hey, I think I have to go. Um, Adam? Hey, are you Adam? Yeah. Hi, I'm Adele. Oh, hey. It's nice to meet you! Yeah, nice to meet you. Uh, thanks for showing up! I know it's a weird time to have an interview, but, you know, working nights and... oh, no. No worries at all. Is this... this is the building? Yeah, all this could be yours to clean! Lucky for me. Uh, have a seat. Oh. Um, so, did you, uh, go to college? Um, yes. I did a little bit of school in Florida. I didn't go to like a big college or anything like that. Oh, no. That's fine. And now you moved to the city to be a... Assassin? Or maybe a circus performer? No? I'm kidding. Obviously not. I want to be a journalist. Wow. So, why do you want this job? I need the money. Okay. Yeah. Why do you do it? Oh, you know... Well, I ask myself that all the time. Well, they normally don't want me to hire women because, you know, working in an office alone for most of the time at late hours... But, you know, I think it'll be fine. Really?! I can... I get to have the job? Oh, yeah. Yeah. I guess you're hired. I mean, you showed up. Oh, my god. Thank god. And you don't smell like pee, so that's already a plus. Yes. Yay! This is great! Well, I have to warn you, the job sucks. That's okay. Let's... let's clean stuff! Okay. Normally, I get here around 12:00. Do I get a key card? Hey, Adam. Adam. Is somebody still here? Oh, that's this guy who always stays here late. He's here almost every night. What do you think he's working on? The next great American novel? Oh, no, he's probably just looking at porn. He doesn't look that interesting. You don't look that interesting. Oh. You're early. No one showed. Uh, can you be a doll and hand me my lipstick, please? Mm-hmm. Thank you. Always have lipstick on when you're entertaining guests. But it's just me. Don't sell yourself short. Let's talk about something else. Tell me about the big bad city. Still smoking? I blame you. Hmm. There's this man that works late all the time that I have kind of been stalking. Sounds about right. And then there's this guy Adam who is, like, mildly creepy and super dorky but I kind of love him. Only you could turn a night janitor job into a love triangle. It's not a love triangle. I don't love either of them. It's just... Interesting. Honestly, you won't hurt my pride. Just say you hate it. Say you hate it. I think it's actually not so bad, but I think that you complain a lot. That's because you got all the easy floors. You don't even want to know what goes down on the eighth floor. Do you know I've almost saved up enough money to move out of bed-stuy? Ooh, moving on up. Where do you live? Long island city. Do you like it there? No. Why do you live there, then? I guess it never occurred to me to move. You're an odd bird. Hey, there goes your guy. Oh, I didn't see him. I want to see his face. Why? I don't know. I'm just curious. Do you know what he looks like? Generic dude kind of look. You know, arms, legs, torso, feet. Okay. That's helpful. Is he handsome? Not more handsome than me. I got all the fluid changed, and I added a couple of safety features on the inside. Cool, dad. Thanks. I actually didn't know you knew this much about cars. Yeah, I know a thing or two. Dad, these mirrors are ridiculous. Ridiculous? Must you knock quite so loudly? How else can you hear me? I have a surprise for you. Can I come in? Tada! I think I got a little carried away. Oh, my gosh! Did you do this yourself? Uh, joy helped me. I don't know. I was feeling inspired. I-I think I'm coming around to this little project of yours. Ours. Mm. My favorite New York picture. Ugh. I don't know why you're so hell bent on New York. I never really cared for it myself. You said it was exciting. Yeah, at first, but then it's small and dirty with terrible weather and lonely people. And you want to be one of them, right? Oh, well, suit yourself, darling. I guess we all have to figure it out somehow. I can't believe I'm doing this. Oh! Well, you have to get your kicks some way. Yeah? So, do you want to hear my new favorite quote? Hmm. Where's it from? The Internet. Ooh. It's Carson mccullers. I don't know... I don't know where from, but I think it's cool. I'll be the judge of that. Okay. So she says, "it is a curious" emotion, this certain homesickness I have in mind. With Americans, it is a national trait, as native to us as the roller coaster or the jukebox. It is no simple longing for the home town or country of our birth. The emotion is janus-faced... We are torn between a nostalgia for the familiar and an urge for the foreign and strange. As often as not, we are homesick most for the places we have "never known." 7.5. Shut up. Shit. What are you doing down there? Adam! Jesus, you scared the shit out of me. Why did you do that? Because you're being a creep. Me? Why are you here?! Why are you here? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, zero. Cool. What's going on? Dude, it's not a big deal. It's no big deal, please. I just... I like to write here sometimes, okay? Oh. Well, can I read it? No way. Do you not have a computer? Yes, I have a computer. I just... I like to write here, about him, in his space. The guy who works here? Why? I just do, okay? Oh, I think I thought you guys were like, uh... I don't know. So, um... It's my friend's birthday party on Friday, and some people are getting together and I thought you might like to come. Oh, to a LAN party? You know, for someone who makes fun of mmo's so much, you seem to know a lot about them. Fine, I'll come. Okay. Bye-bye. Sylvia? [ Challenger's "how are my" [ "thoughts not my own?"

I really don't know what happened the other night, but, I mean, I know... really, I know it's not fine. You know, I-I didn't even really remember you being there. I... Do you think that maybe we could be friends again? Well, I-I don't... I don't really know that we ever really were. Okay. Um, well, do you think that we could start now? Yeah. Really? Yeah, really. Yes. Oh, my god. Okay. Good. Thank you. Um, you have to come with me tonight. Oh, Toni... oh, I can't. I really shouldn't, because I have these plans with my friend Adam, and he'll freak out. Okay, whatever you guys are doing is not gonna be half as much fun as this, I promise. Honestly. Really? Just stay. Yes, really. Just stay. Yo, yo, yo. Let's go in here. You guys got beer? What? In the back, sir. Hello. What's up, dude? Hey, how you doing, boss? Let me get some lights. I said reds. No problem. I said lights. These guys are assholes. They're just drunk. Yeah.

What, you seriously want to go with those guys? It's just a party. It'll be fun. I don't want to be with people like that. Are you guys coming? Yeah, just one minute. Let's just go somewhere else. Adam, please. I'm not going. Hello? I have to go. No, you don't. I want to go. Hey. Hey. What happened to Adam? He had somewhere he had to go. That's a shame. He seems nice.

Times Square. What? Why? You should just stay with me. Oh, you know my mom. She likes to show off her travel-agent status. Oh, okay. We can just stay there while we look for a new place. Mm. So, how's it going with Adam? Oh, everything's fine. We talked. I have to go on a date with him in exchange for making him miss this birthday party. Really? Where? Central park. A day date... adorable. Bam! Cool sheet. Why, thank you. You're pretty. Gross. So you think just because you live in New York and you don't have any friends that you're gonna turn into the wild child? No, but it's proven that social isolation has severe and long-term psychological effects. They're talking about kids that are locked in cages or raised by wolves or shit like that. You don't get it. Your brain's too small. Well, all I know is if you feel so lonely, than you should probably just hang out with me more often. Okay. What do you see? That looks like a bear, if you block out that part. Well, that's a cumulus, and that over there is a stratocumulus. I took meteorology in college. You're supposed to pick out shapes and animals. Oh, well, I'm not seven, and I happen to have a wicked knowledge of cloud formations. There's a lady with a cape. Look! Fucking shit. Oh, yeah, there really is. Hey, you know what game I used to play when I was little? What? Have you ever had someone give you cpr? No, 'cause I've never been choking. Well, it's really cool. You blow all your air out and someone blows in and you can watch your lungs inflate. You had weird friends. Here. I'll show you. Okay. Aaaaah! Okay, blow all your air out. Are you gonna kill me? Yes. Blow all the air out of your lungs. Keep going, keep going, keep going, keep going. Keep going. See? I don't like you. Okay. What's wrong with you? I don't know. Okay. You don't have to get all dramatic about it. It's no big deal. You know, you kissed me. I know. I want that to be on the record. Bold print, on the record. You know, to be fair, it was only because of your weirdly seductive cpr game. Yay! Hi! Hey, friend! Look at you. Look at you! How was your trip? My god, you're in freakin' New York. Can you believe it? Finally. It took you the whole summer, dork. I got here. It's happening. It's all happening. Wow. This is like a bank tube. They should give us free lollipops. What is this? Oh, Lila made it! Are those rosary beads? Yeah. I actually... she is a morbid little girl. It's just getting worse. I actually have one for you. Boop. That's for you. Thanks. I need it. You do. So fancy. Is this us? Yes ma'am. 'Cause I think you like him. Hmm, most certainly do not like Adam. Well, I like him. You haven't even met him. Doesn't matter. What neighborhood is this? This is greenwich village. No way. This is where Sylvia lived. Also where Bob Dylan lived. I don't believe you. You're a liar. Is this the Washington square diner? Um, yes, it is. I've actually never eaten here. Have you heard of it? Yeah. I have. You have to take a picture of me here. Why? I'll show you after. Okay. Wait, actually... Sir, can you take a picture of us? Yeah, sure. Thanks. Sara. It's good. Thanks, man. Have a good night. Can't believe we ended up here. Hey, Adele, do you... Do you mind if we just sit for a minute? Yeah. Sure. Come on. This is Sylvia. Mm-hmm. You know, I went through a lot when you decided not to come. I know. Sometimes I feel like I'm racing you... And you're ahead, and... You'll never stop running. So I'm just chasing after you. Maybe you're right. Hey. Hi. It's pretty, isn't it? Yeah. It's like a revolving rainbow of advertisements. It's funny how things happen like that, you know? When something really pretty happens out of something ugly. You're not gonna stay, are you? People put too much emphasis on escaping. You're right. I am? Yeah. This was supposed to be our revolution summer. Maybe it was. Yeah.
