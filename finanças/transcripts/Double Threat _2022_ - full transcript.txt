I'm not okay. - Okay, I'm gonna just take that from ya. Thank you. - It's just, you know, I was tryin' to get a snack and then these guys come in, and a sword, and a creepy old man. He's dead. And then suddenly there's a girl in my car and she's firing at a truck and it explodes. Oh, God! - Okay, um, why don't ya take a few deep breaths, you know, in, out. - I'm not breathing (panting). - Maybe take your foot off the gas pedal just a little bit. There ya go. Look, you're crashing, okay? We need to get your blood sugar up. There's a diner up there on the right. Why don't ya pull in and we'll, uh, we'll lay low for a little bit. - Yeah, that's what we should do. Whatever you, whatever you say (panting). Yeah (pants).

And that was in self-defense, right? Okay, I'm not going back there. You saw those guys, right? I mean, those are some bad guys. - Violent crimes these days. All that just to rob a convenience store. Wait a minute. Nobody sends a death squad to rob a cashier. What was in the till, 500, a grand, tops? You're not telling me the truth. - Okay, fine, fine. The store was a cover, a cover for a crime family who I was working for. But not like working, working for. I was just keeping up appearances and helping you know, distribute money. And maybe skimming some off the top. - You were stealing from those guys? That's why they're after you. - Yeah, why do ya think I had an inch bag ready? - Oh, so, that makes you a fugitive. And you have kidnapped me. - (chuckles) Okay, let's not be overdramatic about it. I had to get out of there somehow. - And I'm heading straight back. See, because I'm a witness, all right? So, it's the right thing to do. I'll just, I'll say I was, uh, I was scared and I needed to leave and, and calm down. It's very plausible. - What's in the bag, Jimmy? - Nothing, it's just a bag. I have a bag, big deal. I'm just a guy with a bag, wow. I'm not askin' what's in your bag. - You're holdin' onto it so tight I'm kinda startin' to think it's a dialysis machine. - Okay, fine. Fine. My brother's ashes. I'm take... I was taking them to the beach to scatter 'cause that's what he wanted me to do. - I'm sorry. - Drunk driver, took out the whole family just like that. (fingers snapping) I need to do this, okay? 'Cause a promise is, it's a promise. - Then you ditch your truck. You get a rental, a skateboard. The longest Uber ride, who cares? And you go to the coast. You'll avoid bad guys. You'll avoid the cops and you can do what ya need to do. - Appreciated, okay? But, uh, the truck, it's my brother's truck. And all I keep thinking is that if he'd taken that tank the night of the accident instead of the sedan, the entire family would probably still be alive. Besides, it's kinda sentimental to me now, you know? And you shot out the rear window. - Oh, I did, didn't I? - Mm hm. - Sorry about that. - I'm a straight shooter, all right? Guys like me don't go out and run. I gotta go back to the cops, end of story. - Okay. Well, um, that's your choice. But I am gonna pay for that window. I just need a minute. - You don't need to do that. Oh my God. (pensive music) (engine rumbling) (door closes) (crow cawing) - I was told 15 minutes tops. The cops have come and gone. Had to pay them off myself. (Ask sighs) - Do you know who I am? - I know you're late. - They call me Ask. Do you know why they call me that? - No. - Because everybody in the syndicate knows if they want anything, and I do mean anything, they come to me first and they ask. - Well, Ask, I'm the boss's son, so I don't care. (pensive music) - She owes us a nine millimeter. You can add it to your tab. Being that I'm the top fixer in this operation and I say that with remarkable modesty, I would rather be doing just about anything besides babysitting you. - Yo, maybe if your guys hadn't messed up the hit you wouldn't have to. - (chuckles) You think these are my goons? No, sweetheart, these are your father's goons. These are the goons that he hired to whack 100 pound girl behind the cash register. It's Ellis, right? - Yes. - Well, Ellis, I'm gonna tell you right now what you should be concerning yourself with. Legacy, family dynasty, your birthright. Except for it's not really a birthright now, is it? Because you know and I know that to clear up this little trouble you've got going on, with, uh, what's her name again? (sword tapping) - Natasha. - Natasha. To clear up this trouble that you've got going on with Natasha, and to do it with any honor at all, you're gonna have to hunt her down and kill her yourself. - [Waitress] You enjoy your meal? - More than I did the company. - Aw, having a bad day? - [Man] Thank you for your money. - I'm just trying not to get shot. - Okay. (TV chattering) - [Woman] So, then I'm seeing a lot of violence. I can afford it, I can afford it.

If you go on the road, you're an accessory to murder. If you go back to the cops, well, you're a snitch. - Accessory to murder? You're dropping the whole self-defense thing? - A nice clean-cut guy like you? Honey, this ain't your world. I mean, you saw how out of depth you were back there, how you handled it. Here's how it's gonna go with you and me. You can't ditch the truck. I get that. But I can offer you protection on the road. In exchange, you give me a ride. You get to pay your respects, I catch the slow boat over the horizon. That's the deal I'm offering. Take it or leave it. - So, we'd go all the way? All the way to the coast? - Until you're sippin' saltwater. ♪ Sorry I'm a junkie just like you ♪ - You certainly seem like you can handle yourself. - I was raised by a sheriff in a small town in Utah. You could say I learned a few things growin' up. - I could use the protection. - Oh, I insist you use protection. ♪ I'm just here for a ride ♪ - Oh. If you insist. - Hm, nice to ride with you, Rudolph. Call me Tasha. ♪ I'm just here for a ride ♪ ♪ I'm just here for a ride ♪ - Look, I still think we should check the local area. - [Ask] Ah ha. - Islands? - The Hawaiian Islands. She's gone to Hawaii. - Wait, you think just because she has a postcard of Hawaii that that's where she's going? It's that simple? - Yeah, it is that simple. She's not Jason Bourne. She's a grifter from the Midwest. She probably struggles to spell her own name. - Okay, so how does that help us? It's not like we can check every car on the way to the coast. Hello? (pensive music) (bag rustling) I thought we didn't have CCTV here? Be incriminating. - We have no official CCTV. This is a little somethin' we have as a backup in case of a situation like this. - Why is this news to me? - Oh, now you're talkin' like a mob boss (chuckles). Ah! Oo, right there. Whoa. Whew (chuckles). - She's done that before. - Mm, like it's routine. (keyboard keys clacking) Here we go. Mm hm. Okay, here we go. (Ask's tongue clicking) Whew. (sighs) Okay. There you go, dark green, late '90s 'Burb headed west with a feisty little brat, and a guy that looks like he still has to sleep with the bedroom light on. Oh, well, pack your lunch box, kiddo. This is gonna be a walk in the park. We'll send some goods ahead. (Ask inhales) (exhales) Animal cracker? (mellow music) - So, Einstein's general theory of relativity is based off of classic physics framework. But you can't use that understanding of gravity within quantum physics. You have to use quantum gravity in order to encompass the non-gravitational forces. - Yeah, would you be careful of that near the interior? - Yeah, I am being careful. So, that brings us to string theory. Well, actually to superstring theory which just brings us to straight M theory anyway, which gives us the flat dimensions. - You're gonna spill it. - Do I look like a five-year-old? The point that I'm trying to make is that space and time coexist and intertwine at the same time, which means right now, like literally, right now, we could be sharing the space we're in with dinosaurs who are alive and roaming the world and we wouldn't even know it. Oops. - See? Tasha! - (sighs) Please call me Nat. - Fine. Nat, are you on drugs? - Huh? - Because you are run hot and cold more than a cheap motel shower. - So, you've noticed? - If you're on drugs, I'm out, okay? There's a line I will not cross. - No, I'm not on drugs. I have dissociative identity disorder. A split personality. - Oh, so you're schizophrenic? - No, it's different. My brain is wired with two different personalities, each with their own skills, mannerisms, et cetera, except for shared memories. Minus the short-term stuff. I mean, that can get a little sketchy but it does all come back eventually. - So, you're Nat? - Yes. - And sometimes you're Tasha? - Exactly. - How do you even begin to fix that? - Well, maybe you don't fix it at all. Just because somebody is wired differently doesn't necessarily mean they're broken. - Sorry, I didn't mean to sound insensitive. - Oh, no, don't be. It's a weird thing to wrap your head around. It only happens when I get extremely stressed. - Well, Nat, I'm pleased to know I don't stress you out too much. So, what are you gonna do when you get to the coast and catch that boat? - I don't know. I guess I'll see where the universe takes me. What about you? What do you go back to after you scatter your brother's ashes? - Uh... - Oh my God, the car's on fire! - No, it's not on fire, it's overheating. - How is that any better? - Oh, I don't know. (groans) Okay, all right. I gotta handle this. - [Natasha] It doesn't like you. - (sighs) No, it doesn't. (engine knocking) (hood pops) (doors slamming) Yeah, it's just great. Just great. Car chase really pushed it right over the edge. My brother had this truck for 15 years. I've had it for two weeks and I break it. - I'll get some water. - No, no, don't waste it. (door slams) - (chuckles) Helps if you... Oh! - That was our last bottle, wasn't it? - Yes. - Because you drank all the other ones, didn't ya? - Also, yes. It's fine because we're in the countryside, so there's, you know, natural sources everywhere. - Or we could just find someone and ask for some help, you know? - No, no, no. Remember the whole like being on the run, thing? Because I shot someone? - You're right, right. Okay, so just make sure we get enough water so if it happens again, we're not screwed. You know what? There's a container in the back. Would you grab it? It's all the way in the back. (Jimmy sighs) God! (upbeat music) Yeah, that's it. - Why do you even have this? - It's my pee bottle. - Ugh. - It's clean. I didn't ever use this. It's brand new. - Bet ya tried it on for size. (Natasha gags) (music continues) Ew! - Maybe I did. It's the perfect size actually. - So, you never really told me what you did for work. - I'm a forensic accountant. - Whoa, you never said anything about forensics. I don't like getting involved in that stuff, and it never really goes in my favor. What are you, like CIA, FBI? - Family law. I sit in a small office all day combing through spreadsheets to assess the assets of couples in the process of a divorce. - So, that's what all the paperwork in your car is for? I mean, like you care about it enough to actually take it on the road with you? - It's very important work, all right? I was lucky to get this time off at all. Anyway, can be interesting from time to time. Wait a minute. Listen. Water. (soft music) (water splashing) (Jimmy grunts) - So, what's like, the most important case you've ever solved? - There's this couple in California. They owned a real estate business together. Millions of dollars was going into their business. Anyway, she caught him, you know, bangin' the secretary. Files for divorce, yada, yada, yada. Nothing unusual until she checks the business account and the balance is less than $100. - Where'd all the money go? - Well, the husband managed to open up a business with the exact same name but just in Arizona. - [Natasha] Oh, no. - Yeah, you know, a few changes here and there in the paperwork and she never noticed. And she wouldn't have either if it wasn't for yours truly combing through the past 10 years of public records, every sale that man had ever made. But it doesn't end there. When she confronts him about it, he's complaining of a migraine so bad he checks himself in the ER. They think he's just another you know, stressed out businessman dealing with a divorce. Give him a pain killer, send him on his way. Well, while he was out in front of the hospital waiting for the car, he gets an aneurysm, drops dead on the sidewalk. - So, you killed him with paperwork? That's the best murder ever. - No, no, I didn't kill him with paperwork. Okay? Karma. Karma killed that guy. Let's go.

Bueno. - That's it? - That's it. (Jimmy grunts) (Jimmy's throat clears) - Nice work. - What? (engine rumbling) (upbeat music) - You know, I just don't get why we have to kill her, you know? Doesn't that seem a bit strong to you? Couldn't we just punish her for disobedience? Killing's over the top, you know it. - No, no, no, no, no, no, there is an order to this world, Ellis. And I don't mean the outside world. I'm talkin' about our world, the criminal world. We have a duty to maintain that order or the whole thing falls apart. You went every single grunt in the syndicate taking a little bit off your bottom line? - No. - No, of course not. It's about sending a message so everybody knows who's in power. It's about never having any unfinished business so that everybody knows whether it's a few cents or it's a stack of papers. You will stop at nothing, and I do mean nothing, even if it's your own grandma, to get your pound of flesh and restore balance. - Okay, well, maybe that's not my style. Maybe as a leader, I don't want to waste my valuable time on things that I couldn't care less about. - Oh, you care. You care too much. It's written all over that pretty little face of yours. You just care for the wrong reasons. You think I can't see that? I've been doin' this for 20 years. - What are you talking about? - What I'm saying is that whatever you feel for this Natasha girl has gotta take a backseat to honor. - (scoffs) Whatever. She's nothing special. Do you have any idea the kind of access to women that a guy in my position has, and what those women will do to live my kind of lifestyle? - No, I, uh, I don't. - Yeah, it's ladies' night at Ellis Island and I'm beatin' 'em off with a stick. - You have an island? Oh. That's nice, discreet. Then what do you guys do when you're on that island? - I don't know, use your imagination. - Okay, like Ellis Island, Ellis Island? Or is this a club that we're making an analogy to? Or how, so I know exactly what you mean. - I'm Ellis, there's an island. Ellis Island, ladies getting on it. - Women there, right. - That's right. - That's right, okay. - Boom. - The, oh, okay. So, Ellis Island is like, it's like a joke on your name. Like, you are Ellis and you are an island unto yourself kinda thing? - Yes, if I had an island, it would be called Ellis Island. - That already exists. You couldn't probably name it that. - What do you mean it already exists? - Oo. - I didn't buy an island. - Okay. - God. Are these seat warmers not working? (buttons clicking) (Natasha sighs) - Half a mile up the highway in the middle of nowhere and you still can't go? - You're not helping. So, you're an accountant, right? - Yeah. - Well, I have some money that I've acquired over some time and I think it would be good if I could- - Make it look like it came from a legitimate source? - Yeah, seems like you'd know how. - Got a little saved up in your piggy bank there, mighty might, hm? - Mighty might? - Lookin' to start a new Roth IRA, invest a few funds? How much we talkin' about here? - Like, 650. - Yeah, nobody cares where you got $650 from, Nat. - 650 grand. - What? Are you serious? 650... That's over half a million dollars. - Wow, you really are an accountant. - Oh, shit. No, nope, nope, sorry. I can't get involved in anything like that. I'll lose my job. Lose my... I'd go to jail. I can't go to jail, okay? I'm sorry, I can't help you. - That's okay, I understand. (urine splashing) - (sighs) All right, you know, I can give you a few tips, though. You know, I'll help you out a little. But just a little. And if anybody asked, I didn't help you. What's going on? You trying to start a flash flood or what? - [Natasha] Chill out, I'm done. Oh! Ouch. - Oh, you know, for someone who offers protection, you sure are a liability. (Natasha scoffs) You okay? (Natasha grunts) You gotta go that way. Yeah, up the bank. - It's this way. - You got it. (pensive music) Bad guys. Bad guys. Hurry, come on, get up the bank! Let's go. (engine revving) (dramatic music) (men grunting) - [Man] Oh, shit. - [Man] There she is.

(shot firing) - Where the hell did you learn to fight like that? - I trained rigorously under the tutelage of a samurai master when I was traveling through East Asia. I can strangle a man to death with my bare thighs. - That's a helluva way to go. - Mm. (dramatic music) Go. - Okay. - Hey, Tasha. - Hello, baby. - Take the shot, Ellis. I can't be the one that does it. Take the shot, Ellis! (air hissing) - I thought you loved me! (engine rumbling) (music continues) (Ellis exhales) - You idiot! What do you think this is, a Hallmark movie? - Ow, jeez, my elbow. Ugh, and my hip. - Yeah, you got pretty rowdy back there. - I didn't do anything. - So, uh, who were they? Seemed like they were way more serious this time. - It was Ellis. Probably one of his cleaners. Not quite the boss but as high up the food chain as you're gonna get. - Great. And, um, a relationship seems to exist? - You could say that. I was engaged to Ellis. So, he probably feels a little jilted right now. - I can't imagine why. - Look, it's what I do. I get close to criminals, I screw 'em over and I move on. It's my own personal way of dishing out karma. You know, in that regard, you and I aren't so different. - So, were you gonna go through with it and actually marry that guy? I'm sorry. It's none of my business. - Truth is, I don't know. I never know what kinda trouble I'm gonna get into because I turn into another person, remember? I mean, Tasha doesn't just fix problems, she also creates them, too. Yet, she doesn't have to deal with the consequences. I'm the one that gets to wake up with a tattoo of a sword on my wrist, or an engagement ring on my finger. - She does seem pretty unfazed by everything. - Doesn't she just? - Yeah. - Yeah, it's fun to be me. - Hey, you know, I think I saw a medical kit in here. Here. - Thank you. - Yeah. - It's very kind. And for the record, I have no feelings for Ellis. - Oh, hey, it's, uh, it's got nothing to do with me. - I know, I just want you to know the situation logistically. - Logistically? - Yeah, logistically. - Logistically. Okay. (soft music) (Jimmy chuckles) - [Ask] Please tell me you found some keys. - No, she must've swiped 'em. We can't take the truck. (Ask sighs) - I can't believe you had the shot and you bailed. - I didn't bail, all right? I was just checking to see if she was running from the situation or running from me. - Oh my God, can you be any more pathetic? She's the worst. She's literally the worst choice you can make. You're never gonna know what she wants because that kinda girl, she doesn't know what she wants. (scoffs) It's the mystery combined with the hedonism, that's the allure. You need somebody more mature, like a woman that makes you appear smarter and more confident than you actually are, like a doctor or a chemist. - You know what? You don't even know her. Besides, I'm not into chicks who wear glasses. (Ask sighs) - Your entire future hinges on this right now, and you are willing to let it trickle through your fingers. Why? Have you thought about that? Because you found some tiny little human and you think she's cool because she's playing hard to get? This is where you take control of your mind. She is showing you zero loyalty right now. Your loyalty is with your family. - Oh, yeah? Do you know how hard it is to get over somebody? You probably don't because you're clearly unlovable. - Maybe I'm trying to be unlovable because maybe this right here attracts way too much attention, so I have to weed out the weak offers. I just let the strong swimmers through, if you catch my drift. - Wow. That's classy. Look, you don't need to prove anything to me and I don't need to prove anything to you. - But you know what you do need to do? You need to prove something to yourself. You need to prove that you can get over this Natasha whatever, move on and do the right thing, which is shoot her in the head. - Have you seen what she's capable of? Now imagine that in the bedroom. You try getting over it. - She just kicks a lot. Just get a little blowup doll or something. They're much easier to deal with. - Just change the tire. - I don't, I don't... I've stopped listening to you. - Lefty, Lucy. - I'm sorry, are you talking to me like that? - Yes, just change the tire already. Are you kidding me? - I'm done. Get in the truck. I will shoot you right in the balls. I don't care. - Okay, fix the tire. Righty tighty, okay? - I don't think your dad will mind if I bring him home a girl instead of a boy. (sullen music) (engine rumbling) - What was his name? I don't really like referring to him as the box. - Uh, Bobby. Well, Robert, but you know, they used to call us Bobby and Jimmy. We used to do a lotta fun stuff together. - (chuckles) Yeah? Like what? - Well, we got our pilots license together. We were actually thinking about buying a plane at one point. - You can fly? Get out of here. (Natasha chuckles) - I should do that again. Guess it might bring me closer to him. (anticipatory music) Jesus! What the heck?

That is living. - I know, okay. I want to be fun. I want to let loose to be wild at times. I just, I don't know. I just always play it safe. Maybe I'm scared. - Look, it's easy. Your turn. - Look, I... (Jimmy sighs) (Natasha chuckles) Oo. There we go. - [Natasha] How does that feel? - Oh, yeah, yeah, feeling good. Feeling good. - All right. Let's try something. - Good. - I want you to yell as loud as you can, "I'm not gonna be pushed around anymore." - Mm. I'm not gonna be pushed around anymore. - That was pathetic. Louder. Come on. I'm not gonna get pushed around anymore! (soft music) - I'm not gonna get pushed around anymore. - Oh, that was weak. - I'm not gonna get pushed around anymore! - I'm not gonna smile just because people tell me I need to look happy! - And I'm not gonna put my personal checking account information under $10 on my tax returns anymore! - And I'm not gonna deal with any more of Tasha's hang overs. - Yeah, and I'm not stoppin' for yellow lights anymore. That's it. You know what I'm not doin'? I'm not playin' fantasy football anymore. I'm not goin' on social media anymore. I'm not countin' my daily steps anymore. I'm not gonna go to the gym two times a day anymore. That's it! - And I'm not gonna deny that I freaking love Nickelback. - That's a great band. - Yeah, it is. - Great band. And you know what? I'm not gonna rotate my tires every six months anymore. I'm not gonna care what people think anymore. I'm not gonna live inside a little bubble anymore. I'm takin' my pants off. This feels great. Do you see this? I'm not gonna take life's shit anymore! And if anybody has any problem with it, you can just kiss my ass! (Natasha chuckles) Woo! (upbeat music) - (chuckles) Now, that is engaging. - Yeah, I'm gonna pull my pants back up now. - Okay. - Yeah. - [Radio DJ] Hey, it's 155 for your afternoon drive. You got Sugar Shade right here 102.7. This is Shock-A-Delic - Not. - [Radio DJ] with their latest release, "Baby Be Mine." - Yeah. - Yeah, but... No, I got it. Sorry.

Anything else you wanna tell me about? - Yeah, three years helping a Native American tribe fight against an illegal pipeline. They called me Ahotamik. - Ahotamik? - Yeah, it means restless beaver. (Natasha's hand patting) - Uh, we really should go. We gotta get goin', come on. (mellow techno music) (horse whinnies) (tailgate thuds) - Whoever said romance was dead? Now, I hate to be the one to say I told you so but I hope this is all the closure that you're gonna need. - You know what? I don't get it. Why do you care so much about me going through with this? - Honestly? - Yes, honestly. All the pressure that you're putting on me. What comes my dad paying you some sort of a bonus or something? What's the deal? - Listen to me right now. My father mentored your father. Your dad wasn't always such a big shot, Ellis. He had a little bit of help. So, this is it just a rite of passage for you. This is the rite of passage for both of us. (Ask sighs) (gentle music) - Really? - Really. - Okay, well, it doesn't matter because I'm done with Natasha. - Oh. - She had her chance and she blew it. We're gonna finish this for good. Your dad's gonna be proud of you. - Yeah, well, thank you for this sentiment, really, but my dad is dead. I have a trick up my sleeve. It's gonna raise our game and then we're gonna catch up to that cat piss, Evergreen. - I'm sorry I called you unlovable. It was out of order. - Thank you so much for that apology. It did hurt my feelings a little bit. - You, uh, you wanna hug it out? - No, Ellis. I never wanna hug it out. Get in the truck. (anticipatory music) (car beeps) (door slams) - What are you doing? - I'm taking control is what I'm doin'. Last time you were in control, you took us right into the lion's den. - I know. I'm sorry. (papers rustling) - Got it. (trunk slams) - Hey, this might be a bad time, and I'm almost too afraid to ask but what happened to my butt? Feels like I rode a cinder block down a staircase. - Yeah, this is a bad time. (engine rumbling) (car alarm blaring) (music continues) - What is this place? - It's a client of mine. She caught her husband cheating at the beach house when she herself went there to get frisky with the yoga instructor. Real nice couple. Anyway, this is a transcript of the deposition we took. "The f'ing key's by the f'ing door under the stupid f'ing raccoon statue, you self-righteous piece of..." Wow. Well, that's not very Christian. Let's see here. Okay. Bam, still there. (wreath bells jingling) Yeah, this'll do for the night. Hey, don't beat yourself up, all right? You protected us in ways I can't even imagine. - (sighs) Yeah, well, the truth is, we only got caught in the first place because of me. - You were trying to do the right thing, all right?

I don't know what it is, it's like they're some sort of power couple or something. - They're not a power couple. It's all her, I guarantee you. - That's good, use that petty frustration. Feel some anger. This is good. I'm gonna put in a call to a friend. He's a powerful friend. Works for one of those three letter organizations that we do our best to try to avoid. - Well, if they're a friend of yours, then they're a friend of mine. Look, I wanna start being looped in on all this stuff from now on. You need to start treating me like a boss. - Oh, yes, Sir, sounds good to me. Well, our friend will red-flag their license plate and then enter it into the Amfer database. If they drive past any traffic camera in the state, we'll get notified immediately when and where. - Why weren't we doing that already? - Because I didn't want to use one of my asks. - Hey listen, this isn't just simply a rite of passage for me anymore, okay?

He's here, speakerphone? (Ellis sighs) - Eli, my boy, how ya doin', Son? Please tell me you're okay. - He called me. - Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah. I'm doin' okay, Dad. I was just out, uh, checking the, uh, the perimeter. - Good, good, I'm glad you're safe. I was gettin' worried about you. So, you wanna tell me why I did bodies everywhere and a trail of destruction headin' all the way to the God damn Pacific coastline? - Yeah, I've been trying to warn people, Dad. This girl is easy to underestimate, all right? But they wouldn't listen to me. They wouldn't take me seriously. Plus, she's working with this guy who's clearly some kind of a badass. - Eli, I need you to take that big stick that's up your rear end and put it in drive, okay? I need you to get your ass in gear and I need you to get this job done. - I am getting it done, Dad! - I need you to find that tough guy that's buried deep down within yourself. - I am a tough guy! - Eli, Eli, Eli, I need you to understand that I'm not gonna be around forever. I need to know that my precious little boy is safe. For that, he must become a man on his own terms. - This is your badass. (anticipatory music) - Yeah, I know, Dad. I appreciate it. Look, I have this under control. Pretty sure I know where she is. - That's great to hear. Now, I'm gonna send you some more resources to help ensure you got everything you need. If you can finish this without getting pretty much every member of our syndicate killed in the process, and leading every authority in California right to our doorstep, that would be doin' me a huge favor. - I will have it done tomorrow, Dad. You have my word. - I'm confident it will be. Good chat, Son. Take care and be safe. And your mother sends her love. (pensive music) (Ellis whispering faintly) (receiver slams) (gentle music) (birds chirping) (dishes clattering) - Hey. (Jimmy grunts) I made some tea. We should get moving soon. - Yeah. Wow, thank you. - Look, I'm sorry I got upset last night. It's not you. It's her. You just, you need to understand what Tasha really is. - And what is she exactly? - Well, for starters, she's a superficial bitch. All she has to offer is shooting and hitting things because, no offense, that's what guys think strength is. And you know, she's not even into all the badass things that guys typically like because she likes them. No, it's because guys like them and she desperately wants to be adored. She's a Barbie doll with a G.I. Joe attitude, and a total liar. I mean, don't even get me started on all of her embellished back stories. - Wait, you were never raised by a small-town sheriff in Utah? - We had a temporary foster parent who was a security guard. - And the Army course? - Basic reserve training. And a summer job in Jiffy Lube. And no, we didn't help protect Native American reservations either. We rode horses for a summer and went through a major hippie phase. - So, you never traveled through Asia and studied with the legendary samurai warrior? - Oh, no, that's 100% true. We can rip a man's heart out of his chest still beating. - Oh, that's good to know. - I get why you guys fall for her sexy femme fatale act. - Yeah, look, Natasha said- - You're an average guy and you want to live a normal life, so, what is she to you? - She's chaos. - She's what you think you want. And I don't blame people for being tempted, but please don't fall for it without knowing what it is. Tasha's a part of me, Jimmy, and she's dangerous. That makes me dangerous, too. - Yeah, I think you got it all- (object thuds) (anticipatory music) (engine rumbling) - What was that? - I don't know. The truck, it's gone! No, no (panting)! - Where's Bobby's ashes? - I left them in the truck. - (sighs) What are we gonna do? (plane engine whirring) - Are you thinkin' what I'm thinkin'? - I fixed that truck, now I'm gonna get it back. Let's do this. (hand patting) (upbeat music) (plane engines whirring) (Jimmy grunting) - Oh, yeah. Okay. Oh. Oh, no, no keys. There's no keys. (keys jingling) (panting) Unbelievable. Here we go. Preflight inspection completed. Seats adjusted, secured. Seat belts fastened. Cabin door closed. - What are you doing? - I can't remember unless I do it in order. - Okay, well, if you could remember a little faster, that would be great. - Listen, I gotta reach out to traffic control. It's for our own safety. Big Bear 2-4- - This is why the other reindeer won't fly with you, Rudolph. Go. (engine whirring) (upbeat music) (dramatic music) - [Jimmy] We're doin' this. - [Natasha] Woo! - [Jimmy] We are doin' this. Welcome to Escape Airlines. I'm your pilot, Jimmy. (Natasha laughs) We've got clear skies all the way. (plane engine whirring) (music continues) This is pointless. We're never gonna find it. - Oh, ye of little faith. There she is. Right, I see a weak point. - Shouldn't we be coming up with a plan? - That's what they'll be expecting. - So, just more chaos then? - (laughs) Oh, you know me too well. - Yeah. (plane engine whirring) (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) (anticipatory music) - [Man On Radio] Hey, Dave, you comin' over for lunch? - Hey, that's what I've been waitin' for. (Dave grunts) (dramatic music) (Natasha grunting) - Nice to see you, sweetheart. (Dave grunting) (music intensifies) - Is he dead? (shot firing) Yeah, good shot. God! Sorry. - Ya done? - Yeah. My shoe lace. I'm sorry, I nearly tripped. (music continues) I think they know we're here. - Good. (music continues) (shots firing) (door bangs) (man grunts) (shot firing) (music intensifies) - Tasha! Oh! - What the hell are you doing? - Is aggression the only solution for you? - Yeah. - You know we hooked up, right? - Rudolph, I wouldn't hook up with you if you were the last man on the planet. Unless... Did she... Damn, Nat. Get in the car. - All right. (mellow music) - Where are the keys? (Jimmy whistles) (gun thuds) (pensive music) (Jimmy panting) (Jimmy grunting) (bucket thudding) - Nat? Nat? Hey? Hey, look at me. You okay? - What happened? - They got us. (rope creaking) (Ask speaking faintly) - [Ask] In stilettos. - What do ya think they're talkin' about out there? - They're gathering witnesses for an execution. - Oh (exhales). Look, I don't want to state the obvious here, but now would be a really great time if you could do the whole Wonder Woman thing. - Look, Jimmy, it's not like I can just go into a phone booth and change, okay? - Okay (panting). (rope creaking) (music continues) - Look, there's something I haven't told you. It's about how Tasha came to be. I was an orphan. But in the beginning, it wasn't just me. I had a twin sister. And we got passed around a lot. We were all each other had. And then one day, she was just gone. They took her from me. You know, it's really hard going through something like that by yourself. You know, I needed someone. So, I created an imaginary friend, Tasha. The kids would tease me about not having parents. Tasha told me everything was gonna be okay. She was always in my corner, you know? And as I got older and the world got more dangerous, Tasha helped me survive. She always did the things that I was too afraid to do. But with you, I have been more myself these past few days than I have been in a really long time. You don't make me feel like I have to act a certain way, or that I have to choose one side of my personality over the other. You just make me feel wanted as a whole. - That's what I've been tryin' to tell you, Nat. I know you got two personalities, but your one person to me. And when I told you that I fell for you, I fell for all of you, okay? (pensive music) Look at, there's no you and her to me, okay? There's just you. I love you, Nat, okay? Don't you ever doubt that. - Execution time. Oh, I do love the setting, dark, moody, ominous, this lingering atmosphere of complete dread. Mwah! Perfection. - You know what? I couldn't figure out why it was that you went back for that piece of crap truck, so I took a peek inside. So sorry for your loss. - Oh, I would also like to add that I am so happy that this nightmare is almost over. But if anything, the length that we went through to catch this problem child only added to the greatness of the rite of passage for our future heir to the throne. - I have a special request. I want all of you to put down your weapons. I want there to be no doubt that I did this on my own terms. I don't want anybody thinking that Ellis Lombardo needs anybody to do his dirty work. - Oo, it's a nice touch. You heard him, boys. Guns on the ground. (anticipatory music) - Hey? No. No! (knee thuds) (Jimmy grunts) (Natasha gasps) (Jimmy groaning) (pensive music) - Okay, final chance. You say you're sorry, we pretend this never happened and you come with me. - Ellis? - I'm not going with you. - There you go, she doesn't love you. Shoot her. - I'm just checking my options, all right? (music continues) All right, what if it's between him dying and you comin' with me? - Don't do it, Nat. Don't you do it. - Okay, okay. I'll go with you. If you let him go, I'll go with you. It's a deal. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. There is no deal. There is no deal. We have an agreement. She's obviously lying to you. Raise the gun and shoot her! - Why don't you get off my back? I don't answer to you, I don't answer to my father, I don't answer to anybody. What is your problem? - I'm just trying to be a good mentor. - Well, you suck. (music builds) - You know what? Screw you and your legacy. I'm gonna do this myself. - Oh, no you don't. - You're not gonna use that. - Keep your hands off your weapons or she gets it between the eyes. - This is what you awakened inside of yourself? A sniveling traitor? Oh my God, Ellis, it's tragic. - Maybe it's my rite of passage. - (laughs) I'm so sick of you. (shots firing) (men exclaiming) (shell casings clattering) (pensive music) (Ellis panting) - Taking this as an insurance policy. (knife clatters) Get over here. (Jimmy grunting) Get stuffed. (music continues) (Jimmy grunts) Take this. Get over here. Don't try anything. - Jesus. - Stop it. - Okay. - Get in the car. Get in. - [Natasha] Ow. (doors slamming) (engine rumbling) (energetic music) (Ask coughing) (Ask gasping) - Hey. You, uh, you okay? - (laughs) Do I look okay? Oh, he shot me (laughs). (Ask gasping) - Hey, look, I think we can work together here, okay? You know, my enemy's the enemy kinda thing, right? What do ya say? - Am I the only one that stays in my frickin' lane? - Yeah, see, I know where they're goin'. - Oh, yeah? - I do. - Where would that be? - Vegas, baby. - Oh, Vegas? Wow, that is, of course... Vegas. - (panting) They're gonna hitch that wagon. He loves her. - (gasps) Oh, love. - Yeah. (dramatic music) (Jimmy grunts) (shots firing) (Ask gasps) Holy shit. It worked. It worked (panting). (dramatic music) (engine rumbling) - You didn't let him go. That was the deal. - Shut up! Tasha will be fine with this. You're the one that's messing things up. Tasha wants to be with me. - You were always just her play toy, Ellis. - I said shut up! (music continues) - Ha! (tires squealing) - Get outta the car! Get the box. - What are we doin' here? - Shut up! - Ellis? - Hey! - Shut up! - Take your hands off her, man. Hey, look, let's just talk about this, okay? - You're not havin' her, bro. - Come on, man, what are you doin'? Come on! - Shut up! What's goin' on? Where's Tasha? - I don't know. She hasn't been around as much anymore, now that he's here. - You killed off Tasha? - What are you talkin' about? - Right, but she's gone, you're worth nothin' to me. Get down there. - Hey! - Get back! - Okay, all right. - Just shut up. Gimme the box. - No. - Gimme the box! - No. - Come on, man. - Gimme it! - No. - Gimme the box! - No. - Give it to me. - No, don't! Stop it! Put the box down. - I'm sorry about it. - Put the box down. - It's your choice. Her, or your brother. - Come on, man. (suspenseful music) - (panting) Looks like you made your choice. - [Jimmy and Natasha] No! - [Natasha] No, don't. - No! - [Ellis] Get back! - I swear to God, I swear to God, man. - Ellis, please, don't- - I cannot believe you chose that loser over me. (panting) On your knees! - Look at me. - Shut up! Get down. - All right, fine, fine. Look, I'm down on my knees, all right? - This what you want? (panting) Sucks to be you, bro. - Come on, man. Don't do that. Don't-(gun cocks) Just, come on, man. Come on! - You're a dick, Ellis. (fist thuds) (Ellis grunts) (Ellis yells) (water splashing) Oh! Oh my God. How does she do that? - I don't know. - I think I broke my hand. Oh my God, it really... (Jimmy panting) (Natasha panting) I'm sorry. - It's okay. (Jimmy panting) - What now? (Jimmy panting) - We're gonna finish this, you and me. That's what we're doin'. I'm gonna get you to that boat. (sullen music) (water splashing) I'm sorry, brother (panting). I tried, man. I tried. Let's go. (music continues) (doors slamming) (engine rumbling) (singer vocalizing) (waves splashing) - I can see why Bobby picked this place. It's beautiful. - Yeah, we used to come down here all the time his kids. See those rocks over there? The wind comes blowin' through, so we would run full speed side-by-side, arms back, towel outstretched, seeing if we could catch just enough lift to take off. So, where is the universe gonna take you this time? - The same place it always takes me. The Molokai Islands in Hawaii. Locals refer to it as the Twin Islands. - So, was Ellis right, what he said back there? You finally killed off Tasha? - Honestly, I don't know. I have a feeling she's only going to show up if I really need her. When she does, that girl is gonna be wilder than ever. (gentle music) - I'm gonna clean that money for you. You don't have to worry where it came from. - Thanks. You know, I'm startin' to think that two and half thousand miles is a long way to be on a boat by yourself. - Yeah? Thinkin' about puttin' down some roots? - Are you ready for a helluva lotta baggage? - Yeah. I can handle it. - Can you? - Yeah. (gentle music) - [Natasha] You did your brother justice, Jimmy. He's in the water now. And eventually, he'll visit every beach there is. - [Jimmy] You know what? I love the way you think. (Natasha laughs) (waves splashing) (pensive music) - Over two dozen men, multiple vehicles, countless weapons, my top fixer, all lost. Give me one good reason why you should ever inherit a single thing from me. - Because I found that person you wanted me to find inside myself. And I wanna get back out there and finish this once and for all.
