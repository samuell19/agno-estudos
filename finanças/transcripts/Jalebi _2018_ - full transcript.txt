Last night I just wanted to kill myself. Seemed like there's no point to all this. But then your face flashed before my eyes. What will you do without me? Ayesha dear, life is not like one of your books... ...where you can put a full stop whenever you want. No. No, dear. If you didn't want to get married, you could've just told me. It's been 7-years since that incident. 7-goddamn-years, Ayesha. What is wrong with you? How long can you live alone? I am growing old. - I can just... - Yesterday, when I was getting ready. Everyone around me was so happy. But to me, it was more like a commotion. Actually, I was feeling so suffocated, that it was getting difficult to breathe. My entire life revolves around this one question... - ...that why didn't he show up, papa? - Ayesha, no. No, dear. - Why didn't he show up, papa? - Enough, dear. Stop it. Nothing happened. Nothing happened. - Nothing happened. - I am sorry. - I am sorry. I am sorry, papa. - No, no. - I let you down. - No, no. - I couldn't go through with it. - No. I am so sorry. It doesn't matter to me what the people are going to think. Just tell me... Tell me what you want from life. Tell me. Papa... I... I want to go far away from this atmosphere, and this situation. - Can you give me 24 hours, please? - Of course, dear. Of course. Why not? Just tell me where you want to go. I'll book flight tickets right now. Just... Just cancel your book reading session in Delhi. No-no, papa. That's important. How long will I keep running from my past? Please. Please. Am I talking to the one-book wonder with a broken heart... ...who lived happily ever after. Yes, you are. I heard that you broke your engagement with Samir. Marriage is not for me. I cannot make the same mistake again. If you don't want to get married, then start your next book. I can't do it. Whenever I open my laptop, I find myself in the same situation again. That same question... The truth is Ayesha... he never loved you. He never loved you. She hung up on me. Yes, mom. Dear, dear... Yes, of course, mom. Okay, let's go then. Come on. Mom. Mom. Mom. Pulti, if you don't come now then I'll leave you on the station. - But mom, my shoe... - What shoe? The lace has come undone again. How do your laces come undone all the time? You must be fiddling around with it. I've told you a thousand times... And you're laughing. Come on, move. S*** Cigarettes, man. Pradhan. Mrs. Pradhan. Miss... Oh, sorry. Ms. Ayesha Pradhan. - Seat no. 15. - Is there a problem? No problem, madam. Just a small request. What request? - This is Mr. and Missus. Singh. - Hello. Newly married couple. Their problem is that they booked their tickets for a two-berth coup. And for some reason, they were allotted a four-sharing coup. Well, this can be a system error or maybe their agent. But their first journey's been spoiled. So we had a request if you could... Please, madam. Okay. Okay, madam. Thank you, madam. Very cooperative. Say thank you to her. Thank you. I kept the keys on the fridge. Please come, madam. Please. Yes, we've settled down. No, there's no problem. Yes, we're comfortable. Yes, of course. We'll leave as soon as the train departs. The same old, train special. - Potatoes and bread. - Mutton kebabs. And sweetmeat. She knows everything. No-no. Yeah... You keep it. Passenger no. 4? There he is. Great. Will he need a blanket? Right away. Devdas is laughing. - Congratulations. - Congratulations. Anu. Sorry. My name is Anu. I am Anu. Ayesha. Ayesha... Anu. A... A... What a coincidence. Isn't it, dear? And this is my daughter Pulti. Pulti, say hi to aunty. Hi, aunty. Hi. Actually, since the time we left home, from Malad... ...I need to go to the toilet. But you know, Pulti... Can you look after her for a minute, please? I'll be right back. Thanks. Do you know why my name is Pulti? Why? Because I am always up to some mischief. But my father always... Do you want to play a game? Which one? Can you kiss your elbow? Yes. Show. Mummy. - Mummy. - What happened? The train is leaving. Your mom's in the bathroom. Mummy... - Pulti. - Mummy... Pulti. - Mom, where were you? - Why are you so worried? - I was right here, dear. On the train. - Excuse me. Sorry. Dear, I am sorry, I am sorry. I hope she didn't trouble you too much. No. - Mom... - I am sorry. - Thank you so much. - No problem. - Shall we talk to papa? - No. Thank you. Are you okay? Yeah. You look sad. Takes one to know one. Keep it. Yes. Yes, the train has left. No, it's a lady. Pulti is getting along with her really well. Yes. We'll eat in a while. Just a second. Talk to Pulti. Say hello to papa. Mom, how much longer are you going to talk? I am hungry. Just two minutes, dear. I'll give you. Just two minutes. Please. Dev, can I call you after we've eaten, please. You know she will start lecturing me otherwise. Okay, bye. I'll serve your food, okay. You were talking to Arjun, weren't you What? Arjun. He looks fairer on TV. You know, I spent a lot of money to make him win the grand finale. I used to vote on every episode. Madness. Tell me something, shall I serve your food on a plate or will you help yourself? No lunch, but thank you. What happened, dear? Thank you. Wow... You know, kebabs are her favorite. She never shares it with anyone. I think she likes you. Actually, my sister-in-law can cook only three things. So whenever anyone is traveling by train... ...she makes all three dishes. Without even asking. Actually, her father-in-law just had a by-pass surgery. So she was in a lot of trouble. Her baby's just 8 months old. So I just stayed with her for a month. And, even my mother stayed with her for a month before this. Your mother stayed with your sister-in-law? Oh, no...my parents live in Roorki. My mother-in-law. Ohh... Honestly, she is very supportive. When she's around things become very easy for me. Where are you going? Are you from Delhi? Mumbai. I see...so why are you going to Delhi? I have a book-reading session. You're going to Delhi to read a book. I wrote that book. Ohh... So, you're a writer. Nice. Where in Delhi? Def-Col. Defense Colony. Yeah... I see... We stay in Old Delhi. Actually, my husband's family has been living there from the beginning. Our house is very famous in that area. In fact, now that area is known by our name. Netaji's Manor. Do come over someday. It's a great place... Pulti. What happened? - Mom... - It's just a tunnel, dear. It's okay. Mom's here. Don't be scared. And you're a brave kid. The heart of Old Delhi, this is Netaji's manor, and it's heart... ...still beats...with our breath. And these are one of those remaining manors... ...which wasn't deserted by the families living in it. Guys welcome to my home. Okay, guys, that's my younger sister Renu. India's Rising future star. FIne. Rising future superstar. Okay... whoa... More importantly. Do you see these walls? These bricks were laid in 1858. But... - He's so cute. - What are you doing? Each brick is still as young as before. Every... What's wrong with you? - Each stone... - What? Each stone has a story. - Can you hear it? - Yeah. Come on. Okay, guys, everyone follow me. And walk carefully. Somebody better ask a question. And, these railings are absolutely solid. They are carved. Walk carefully, one-by-one. And this is the first floor. And, everything on this floor is antique. And this particular painting behind you used to be my grandpa's favorite... ...because it belongs to 1857... When the war broke out. There was a huge revolution back there. - What? - A revolution at every level. I came here to write my book, and not to flirt around like you. Exactly - Exactly - Come on. That's it. So since that time, till today... So as promised friends, this tour had to end with a traditional Mathur family meal. So, I would like to introduce you guys to the chef. And my mom... Mrs. Kamla Mathur. Come on, guys. So this is our family's special mint chutney. Mint chutney. It's got coriander leaves, garlic, ginger. He's hot. ...there's a special way to eat it. I'll tell you how to eat it. So basically, you have to dip it into the chutney. He's not. He is hot. He's not. He is hot! Can I help you? Hot. It's very hot. The food. - Okay. Drink some water. Why Netaji's Manor? Was there a famous leader in your family? - So... - This house was earlier... ...called Mathur Niwas. But since Netaji came to live here, this name became permanent. - Netaji? - Yeah, you see... Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose. There he goes again. It was the night of 16th December. The aroma of sweet potatoes and Independence was in the air. Netaji had to travel to Afghanistan. He had to save himself from the enemies prying eyes for one night. And then... Baburam knocked on our door. No, he didn't come to sell his soft milk sweets. He brought Netaji Subhash Chandra Bose along. Brother, Flatbreads. Since then Mathur Niwas became Netaji's Manor. Are you some kind of a history buff? Brother is Ph.D. Within two years, he was promoted from asst. professor to senior professor of history. But you see, my brother loved the old relics more than his salary. Mom, what did brother used to say? - The walls of the Red Fort... - Reek of history. Silly boy. You see...a man's choices make him what he is. Isn't that what Papa used to say, Mrs. Mathur? And, if I hadn't chosen this, then I would've never met you guys. As I said, he's hot. And you guys would've never seen Netaji's Manor. Anaida. Anaida. Pick up the phone. Please, Anaida. He used to love her a lot. Arjun became a fan of Queen, Metallica, and AC DC later. Silly boy bowled her over singing Kumar Sanu's songs. Seriously, bro. Which song did he sing? "Just like one needs to breathe...to stay alive..." Oh, retro. "Just like one needs to breathe...to stay alive..." "All I need is a sweetheart, to fall in love." - Hi. - Hi. Hey. Oh, hi. What are you doing here? I want to talk to you. Ohh...but my walk's going to begin shortly, so... Right. I know. I booked it. Again. If you're so in love with Delhi, then I'll recommend you a book. Raza Rumi's Delhi by Heart. It will happen with Delhi as well. The others will be here soon. No one's coming. Sorry. It's just me. No. - There's Lara, Gaby, Sheila... - Setu, Tike, Ranu. All me. You're completely crazy. I mean not crazy, crazy. But I want to be a writer, so a little build up is necessary. Can we sit and talk? - Hello, uncle. - Hello, son. Do you like these cropped up lanes? A lot. See it from my point of view. Everything is close. Like they are asking about each other's well-being. Old homes, but connected roofs, over-grown parapets. And the commotion. Aroma of spices. - And... - And? And that boiling tea, the extra-sweet syrup... ...that aunty with the betel leaf and that balloon man. These are not cropped up lanes. This is my home. How do you make everything so beautiful? Well... It's because of my dad. He used to give me a tour of these lanes every day carrying me on his shoulder. And every Sunday... ...he would take me to these monuments and tell me about their history. And you know, even today when I conduct these tours... ...and try to indulge the people in my world, and tell them my story... ...I feel like my dad is with me. And that feeling makes me feel alive again. Come here, come here. Smile. Phones often get lost. - This will be with me forever. - Okay. You think I am crazy, right? No. - Just a little. - Why? Well, you're going sightseeing with a stranger. You got to be a little crazy to do that. Why stranger? Name; Dev Mathur. Address; Netaji's Manor. Okay. - Can we take that walk again? - Yeah, sure. Come on. "If you don't hold my hands..." "...where else will I go." "I am sure you know..." "...that I am all yours." "Our match...is made in Heaven." "That's why we met on Earth, isn't it?" "I'm seeking refuge in your arms." "Make me just like you are." "If I ever get lost..." "...find me and bring me back." "I'm seeking refuge in your arms." "Make me just like you are." "If I ever get lost..." "...find me and bring me back." "When you arrive..." "...I pray that you never leave again." "When you're not in front of me..." "...my heart gets restless." "Let's sit together...and time stands still." "The grace of love is visible...for you and me." "Our match...is made in Heaven." "That's why we met on Earth, isn't it?" "I'm seeking refuge in your arms." "Make me just like you are." "If I ever get lost..." "...find me and bring me back." "I'm seeking refuge in your arms." "Make me just like you are." "If I ever get lost..." "...find me and bring me back." "Oh yes, please do." "Destiny has...brought you to me." "But I hope our destiny doesn't take us on a separate journey." "Let's live an entire lifetime in this moment." "Two lines may become strangers again." "Our match...is made in Heaven." "That's why we met on Earth, isn't it?" "I'm seeking refuge in your arms." "Make me just like you are." "If I ever get lost..." "...find me and bring me back." "I'm seeking refuge in your arms." "Make me just like you are." "If I ever get lost..." "...find me and bring me back." "Oh yes, please do." I am good at keeping in touch, huh. So don't miss me. Fine, I won't...miss you. My Jalebi. Do I look like a Jalebi to you? No. But you're just as sweet. S*** S*** Anaida. Anaida, listen. You won't believe what happened to me? Dev... Dev... Dev's wife. I am sharing the cabin with Dev's wife. And listen Anaida, it's not just the wife but his 7-year-old daughter as well. 7-years. I don't know what to do. No, no, no. No! My heart doesn't accept it. How can I be so wrong? He loved me. He loved me, right. I need to know. I need to know, man. I need to know. I don't know. I don't know. I need to know. Anaida? Anaida? Anaida? Can you please change my cabin? Any problem, madam? But I want to change. Give me 10 minutes. We'll be arriving in Kalyan Station soon. I'll check and tell you. Thank you. "Your attention please passengers." - Hurry up. - Coming. It's not this one. My, God. - Is she your daughter? - Yes. - Pulti, say hi to aunty. - Hi. Hi. My Faizu. Faizal. My grandson. He's the same age. He lives with his mom and dad in America. Wow! American grandson. Uh, ho...what have you said, dear? That's her biggest fear. That her grandson might become an America. Whether we Delhiites go to America or Africa. But we stay remain Delhiites, aunty. Absolutely right. That's not my fear. I fear that he will forget us. Then dear, then you show some generosity... ...and you remember him on his behalf too. Then you both will be happy. Forget it. We're in the next cabin. Come over, okay. You're too much. - Always joking about everything. - Bless you. Tell me something, will you marry me next time? Huh? What kind of an answer was that? Was it a yes or...just a question? Stop. What is she doing? Who do you want so early in the morning? Hi. Hello. I had a question for you. What? I want to marry you. Huh? Was that a yes or a rhetorical question? Hurry up. I haven't unloaded my bags yet. Or else I'll head back to Mumbai. If you can't say yes can I say yes to her? This call for some sweets. Times are changing. Madam. Hello, madam. 2nd and 3rd Ac are completely full too. If you're having trouble adjusting with the kid in the cabin... ...then you can take my berth. If you stand here like this, then I won't feel nice. This is my home. I can lie down anywhere I want. Thank you. 'Last night I wanted to kill myself.' 'Why didn't he show up, papa?' 'He never loved me.' 'Last night I wanted to kill myself.' 'That two-timer was using you the whole time.' 'He never loved you.' Aren't they a really nice old couple? The happy-ever-after kind. And people always spread rumors that marriages don't last. Isn't it? By the way, if it wasn't for these marriages... ...then living alone in old-age would be so difficult, isn't it? It's difficult to stay alone at any age. And who told people don't feel lonely even after marriages? Right. Loneliness never leaves your side like your shadow. I will never let Pulti leave me ever. And your husband? He wouldn't even let her go to school. You know, he's been to Mumbai twice in one month. Only to see Pulti. - How sweet. - Yeah. Normally he's always talking about Old Delhi. But when he doesn't see Pulti, that same house feels like jail. His home is wherever I and Pulti are. Like they say... Home is Where your Heart is. "Moment..." "Everything stopped in a moment." "When you held my hand with yours." "You go wherever I go." "You're always by my side when I look. "I am the season and you're the breeze." "Sweetheart." "I laugh when you sing." "I cry when you wither away." "I get drenched in the shower of your love." "Sweetheart." "My shadow looks just like you." Come out, the guests are here. "My condition is such these days..." "If I am the dawn, you're the rays of the sun." "If I am the mirror, you're the image." "Your company is so loving, O companion." "You gave me the colors of love." Dev... - "And pulled me towards yourself." - Dev... "Let's get lost somewhere..." "...where this time stops forever." "And tomorrow never comes." "Sweetheart." I am getting very bored at home. - Let's go somewhere. - Where? Kashmir. Not this month, I have a lot of bookings. Next month. "If you want, I'll give you a million dreams." "If you're happy then so am I." "You're unique..." "You're one of a kind." "You don't feel different to me." Mom. Dev. Ayesha smokes cigarettes. I know, mom. - It's just sometimes... - You know. She keeps the doors to your room closed. The doors of this house never remained closed. This won't do in this house. But mom, she writes in there. Will she writes with the doors open? This is her house as well. Fine, I'll do something. I will tell her. "Moment..." "Everything stopped in a moment." "When you held my hand with yours." "You go wherever I go." "You're always by my side when I look. "I am the season and you're the breeze." "Sweetheart." "I laugh when you sing." "I cry when you wither away." "I get drenched in the shower of your love." "Sweetheart." Dev. Dev. Yeah... Do you think that every love story has a 'happily ever after' ending? Aunty, how is it? Is it your mom's birthday? Yes. Tomorrow. Yes, madam. Did you call? Yes, I did. When will this fourth passenger arrive? Do you know anything or not? Who will open the door for him? Oh yes, the fourth passenger, madam. He will board at Bhusawal station. You see, the train is running late. It will reach at 11:30. 11:30? So late. It will ruin our sleep, and what if it's some weird guy? It will be a surprise. Surprise! Ta-dah! What? Senior copy-writer and the youngest partner in their company ever. Wow...congrats my Jalebi. Even I have a good news. Hello. - Lonely Planet just... - All the perks, 25% salary raise. Plus just 5 days work week, meaning Saturday-Sunday holiday. They are even giving me a car for pickup and drop. - But... - I can finally get out. - But... - Maybe now I can write my book. But you were trying for freelance, weren't you? I am bored of running my laptop in the corners of this relic. And Samir said since it's a startup and I get to freelance... If Samir said it, then there's no problem. Meaning? Why do you have a problem with Samir? It's nothing. I am happy if you're happy. I can see that. Ayesh... Since the time we met, you kept saying that you hate regular life. You don't like routine. And now suddenly you take up this 9-5 job and without any discussion. I mean you'll work from Monday to Friday. I have a busy schedule on the weekends. So I am sorry if I am not jumping with joy about this. But okay, I am happy that you will get out of this old relic. - You know I didn't mean it that way. - It's fine. But yes, someday we'll live in our own house. In a normal house. With regular doors, windows, and a shower. Ayesh...this house, Old Delhi, the tours, it's not just a job for me. This is who I am. This is my life. My roots are connected with this house. When we migrated from Lahore with nothing in our hands... ...this old relic gave us refuge. Grandpa's dreams were... ...that the doors of this manor should never be closed for anyone. No... You might feel its melodrama or whatever... ...but, if I leave this house and family, then I can never be yours. Because I will no longer be me, Ayesh. So as backward as this sounds, that's my truth. And my truth? This is not my destination. It can be yours. And what did you say? Backward? Melodramatic? - Is that what you think about me? - What else should I think? You're the one who said that wow, this manor is so cool, so charming, I can spend my entire life here. Yes, I did. But even you said that sooner or later... ...you want to do something more with your life. Beyond Old Delhi. Like your travel company. Why don't you ever think about that? I will... But when the time's right, and on my own terms. And whether its old or whatever, I am going to keep them in my plans. If you can see this world, and understand me... ...only then can we be happy together, Ayesh? Otherwise? "I miss you so much... Excuse me. The train's been standing here for so long. How long is the halt here? We're trying to find out, sir. According to me, I think there's another train crossing, so the line's busy. Ohh... It started. It started. Madam, coffee? Sir, coffee. No, thank you. - So, what was I saying? - Come on. - What? - Come on, let's go. There's no network. Were you trying to find out the delay or trying to start the engine? Dear, you know...I am always late. Allah, there he goes again. Fine, I won't say it. Then...it should be just like the one you used to convince me. "If you want to say something important, or to keep a promise." "If you want to call him back, or just call out to him." "I am always...late." "If I want to save someone...from a sorrow." "The truth was something else..." "...and I had to tell her that." "I am always..." Excuse me. Sorry. "We'll never...part ways..." "Never." "What else can I say..." Ayesha. "To you..." "To you..." Why did you do it, Dev? You were cheating on me all this while. You have a wife. And a child. I was wrong. My body kept lying to me, my heart kept lying to me. You never loved me! I destroyed myself because of you. I destroyed myself because of you! Go! Celebrate your birthday party with your wife and your kid. I can't live anymore. I can't live anymore. No... Ayesha. Ayesha. Ayesha. Oh, God. Dev! I knew it. You can never forget to wish me first on my birthday. Thank you so much. Pulti, look who's here. Look, papa. Papa! How did you get on a moving train? - Happy birthday. - Thank you. Papa got on the train in Bhusawal station. But he was waiting for the date to change. To see this smile. Papa, you brought a cake for mom, but what did you get for me? For you? Jalebi. Happy Birthday to you. My grump. It's a Mathur family tradition. Come on. Really? I stay cooped up in my room all day. And now you've brought me here on my birthday... ...to treat me to some Jalebi. But there's no better Jalebi than the ones that you get in Parathe Wali Lane. I am pregnant. What? Yeah. - Boss... - Yeah... Pack twenty more boxes. I am going to be a father. Ayesh, you have no clue what this means to me. And mom... She's going to be a grandmother. - Don't look at me like this. - Like what. I don't want any child right now. We just got married, Dev. And there's much I want to do with my life. I am just 21. I want to write. I want to travel. See the world. I just started writing. And this pregnancy will ruin everything. It's too early for me, Dev, I can't do it. How is it early? And who says you can't do these things afterward? And anyway, we can't take a life... I can't do that, Ayesh. Sweety... We'll have a daughter. What are you doing here? Come in and meet my husband. - No, it's okay. - Why no? Come on. Come inside. This is Ayesha. She is a writer, of a best-seller novel. You know, she's basically based in Mumbai... ...but, she's going to Delhi for a book reading session. Okay. Ayesha, this is Dev. Your husband. Yes, my husband. Hi, Dev. Hi. He owns a big travel company. Most of our work is handled through the website. But I handle the accounts. I am an MBA after all, and it should come to some use. You know, we built our office right behind the manor. By renovating the place. - But I said... - Mom, cut the cake. Just two minutes, dear. Let us finish talking, then we'll cut the cake. Okay. But I made it clear. You can expand the business as much as you want. But one day a week is reserved for us. For me and Pulti. And we get that. Business has grown twin folds for Disha Travel Company. What? Actually, our daughter Pulti's real name is Disha. So we named our company Disha Travel Company after her. Isn't that nice? - Diya. - Nah... Kaya. Kaya? She's our daughter and not some skin care product. Tara. How is Devika? Tell mom, nice try. And what did your dad suggest? Devisha. Excuse me. He was just trying to come up with something nice but adding up our names. Don't say anything about my dad. Fine. Actually... That's not a bad idea. Dev. Ayesha. Disha! Dev. Ladies and Gentlemen. This announcement is being made in public interest... ...that Dev's Ayesha and Ayesha's Dev have found their 'Disha' (Direction) "The more I look at you... I can't get enough of you." "The more I think about you... I can't get enough of you." "Our love clearly reflects in your eyes and in mine." "It beats in mine your love and my love." "My love and your love." "The more I look at you... I can't get enough of you." "The more I think about you... I can't get enough of you." "It's little yours, and a little mine." "In fact, it's our dream together." "A sweet tune that I can hear these days." "All our sorrows will be alleviated with just a smile." "My love and your love." "My love and your love." What happened? Shall we go out? No. Please. No. "No lives forever..." "...but love stays forever and ever." "The sun, the moon, and the breeze..." "...will keep it alive." "Even after we're no more..." "...love will still prevail in this world." "My love and your love." "My love and your love." "The more I look at you... I can't get enough of you." "The more I think about you... I can't get enough of you." Isn't the cake nice, dear? One photo, please. Smile. Dev, smile. - What a happy family. - Ayesha, I... See. See. Dev, plus Ayesha...Disha. Disha. But my daughter could only be Disha. Couldn't you think of a different name? Disha. I am sorry that her non-existence changed everything. Everything. Why are you crying? I wasn't crying, I was sleeping. And you woke me up. I must go to the toilet. Where are your parents? Mom. Toilet. When did you get up, dear? Come, let's go. You didn't get married. What does it look like? Would it have made things easier for you? I am done. Done. So fast. There's one more thing that irritates me more than your anger. What? Your silence, what else. Well, so things look serious. Fine. I'll have to do something, like always. Greetings, dear. Bless you. No, everything is all right. I was saying that your mother wants to talk to Faizal. Oh my, God. I completely forgot. It's nighttime out there. No, I am sorry. No, the train's running a little late. We'll reach Gwalior in some time. No, dear. It's all right. Goodbye. Both, Father and son are sound asleep. Why did you have to disturb the children at this hour? I wasn't disturbing them. He's our son. I wanted to talk to him and called him. Wishes don't keep track of time. Faizu. My son. Mom, hiccups again. Hiccups gone. Even my mother-in-law does the same thing to cure hiccups. One of her relatives taught her this trick. Brother, some water. Careful Deva. You two just got married, and she already caught you by the nose. You know mom, there's no cure for hiccups. The least we can do is try to divert their attention... ...and hope the hiccups disappear. - I want Agra's sweet. - Where? I want Agra's sweet. First, comb your hair. No. Wait. Papa, I am going. Please look after her. - Pulti. - Disha. Statue. I am your father, my child. So Disha wants to taste Agra's sweets, huh. Release. Let's go. Where is he? Where is he? There he is. Arjun, I am Sunny Singh. You know my wife, Simar. She... Actually, we just got married yesterday. But she's a big fan of yours. She... You know your song "Tum Se". If you can sing that once for Simar, then it will make her really happy. And the train's delayed by two hours. This will help you pass your time too. And my Simar will be happy as well. Right? I am sorry. What? I have a sore throat. I am sorry. - That's okay, we'll get some medicines for... - I said I am sorry. We artists are not some public property. Now please, and I am saying this politely. I am sorry. You know, just to make Simar happy... Anyway... Sorry to disturb you. You know, I had a boyfriend before I got married. I really loved him. More than you can imagine. - Everyone has a past. - Correct. But Dev never asked me anything about my past. Who? When? Where? How? Nothing. When I met him in his house, I was assured about everything... ...that I had heard about the Manor. You know, he took one look at Pulti and took her in his arms. He never asked me for her father's name. He just had one request before the wedding. That we'll call her Disha. That's it. You're right. Everyone has a past. But only a few can see beyond it. Dev. I told you. I told you. Not to roam around on the bike. But you two are over smart. You think you know everything. But you never listen to that one person who bore two children. Please, mom. This is not the time for all this. I see... - So now you don't have time for me. - Mom. - Let's go inside. - You don't have time for me. Mom... God knows whom they think they are. We are not their enemys. I wish they had listened to me. - She thinks it's my fault. - No. She thinks it's my fault, Dev. No. And what about all the dinners, functions, venerations and prayers. Everyone knew it was a difficult pregnancy. You knew that I didn't even want the baby. I know. - I know. - But no. You and your mother cornered me. I told you it was too soon. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. I wasn't ready. My baby wasn't ready. I know. My baby wasn't ready. I lost the child. I am sorry. It's not your fault, Ayesh. It's no one's fault. These things happen. These things happen? These things happen! We lost our child, Dev. Not missed some insurance policy. These things happen! Do you have any idea what happened to me? Does your mother know what I lost? And she keeps telling absurd things to me. You think it doesn't make a difference to mom? That woman did every possible thing for us. And it wasn't just you and mom, even I lost that child. So why tell everyone in the neighborhood? Can't she keep it to herself? Everyone's gathered downstairs to watch this charade. Ayesha, stop dragging my mother into everything. Don't put me in a position where I'll have to choose between my mother and you. And as for me... Just because I wasn't carrying the child, wasn't she a part of me? She wasn't a part of me? I am not heart-broken? I am not in pain? Dev. Dev. "Nothing is like...it used to be." Dev. Dev. Dev. "Tears keep tricking...down my face." Hey, are you blind? I am talking to you. Look at me. Why you... Beat him. Hit him. "Nothing is like... it used to be." "Tears keep tricking... down my face." "The weather is no longer it used to be." "The clouds are here...but there's no rain." "What are this crossroads we've come to?" "The roads are still here... but not the companion." Have a sweet, brother Dev? Its a daughter. "Come let's walk down... the same lane..." "...where we experienced those sweet fragrances." "Maybe there's something left" "Where we started this journey together" "The one that we've lost, and is over." "Maybe we can rekindle that love again." "What is this place fate has brought us to." "Time's running its pace but we're standing still." "My dreams have breathed their last..." "...and are lost in the endless depths." "Not a single sound that gets to us." "We've alleviated from ourselves." "Silence has cropped up in our relationships." "And the heartbeats are missing." "Come back to me like before..." "I need you to hold me tight in your arms." "I can't live in this darkness..." "...let's bring back those dawns again." "...let's bring back those dawns again." Dev. Dev. Get up Dev, and come down. What happened, mom? Come down. Come on. What happened? Come on. What happened? I don't know what's wrong with her. What is this, Ayesh? What is it? Maybe not every love-story has a happily-ever-after ending. I am sorry, Dev. I couldn't do it. This marriage... This marriage was a mistake. I lost everything here. My self-respect. My child. I don't love you anymore. I am leaving your home, but not your life. I wish I knew how to live without you. But, I will try. No, mom. Deva. - Ayesha. - Let her go. Sister-in-law! You know I wrote that song for her. But I vented my frustration on that Sardar instead. Sorry. Why are you apologizing to me? Look, Arjun. You were in love. And you were completely devoted to her. I am not telling you to stop loving. But you must change its course. When it's not possible to reach your destination... ...it's better to let go at a beautiful turn. Hi. It's not right for me to stay here. If I stay, then I'll take your side... ...and that's not right. This is your family matter. You guys decide what to do. No problem. Just solve it here. It's all right. Look, dear. It takes only a moment to break ties... ...but takes an entire lifetime to build one. It's every woman's responsibility to save her marriage. That's not the point, mom. The point is that you guys love each other. Stop acting like you guys don't. Look, I know things are not going right. - But if... - Why don't you two go somewhere? Shimla. Manali, or maybe... Kashmir. Will you come? "You're the one that lights up my world." - "You make my nights and dawn." - Arjun! Yes! "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." "You're the one that lights up my world." "You make my nights and dawn." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "You're like a tale..." "You're like a sonnet." "I want to keep hearing you night and day." "You're my peace of mind..." "...the cure to every pain." "I can't live a moment without you." "You're the one that lights up my world." "You make my nights and dawn." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." "You're my journey and my caravan." "You're my destination and my path." "Your love's had this effect on me." "Your footsteps makes my heart beat." "You're the one that lights up my world." "You make my nights and dawn." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." You were amazing, Arjun. Thank you so much. Let's go, dear. Come on. Yeah. - Very nice, young man. - Thank you, sir. You sing from your heart. Can I say something young man, if you don't mind? Of course. Their love is out of the world. Those who are not destined to meet. Will you love me just like that? What the... - Music heals, bro. - Correct. That's a huge burden off my heart. - Thanks, guys. - Oh, come on. The journey comes to an end, but life goes on. ...Nizamuddin Express is arriving on Platform no. 17. Come on, papa. Let's go. Why are you walking so slow? Let's go. Sorry. Thank you. I should be saying thank you. I ate all your food. You were such a good company. You don't know what you gave me. My home. My family. Dev. Actually, I had a hunch when I saw you. But, when you caught Dev's nose, I... Anyway... Maybe you won't want to meet me again. But, I'll be happy to meet you. You do have our address. Do come over some day. I'll really like that. Thank you. Papa. Statue over. Mom, see what's wrong with papa. Papa, what happened? Papa. I did come. Kashmir. I was there, Ayesh. You were standing in front of the stream, Wearing a black color jacket. You were looking at the water. I can never forget that face. Made me feel like I have distanced you from yourself. I don't think I ever loved you more than at that moment. Because everything changed that moment. It seemed like the entire universe was trying to tell me something. And I am so stupid that I can't understand. Then I saw you. For the first time, I thought about you. Why should you make all the sacrifice in your life? Why can't I do something? Did you ever think... Why I started the divorce proceedings? Why did I become the bad guy in your view? Because you were complete even without me. My Ayesha's world was much bigger than Netaji's manor. It was longer and broader. I wonder what I was trying to do? How can anyone contain the sea in a well? And as for your novel. I read it. Over and over again. And after reading it, I knew...that I am not your destination. I was just happy that I could give you a small push in your flight. Don't let it go waste, Ayesha. Please. You know, I read a story when I was a kid. The story of two birds. Their worlds were different. One was made for the skies, and the other for the cage. But they fell in love. Even after many efforts, ...the bird couldn't live in the cage, ...nor could the other one soar in the skies. But their love never diminished. Maybe... Maybe we're like those birds, Dev. For years I carried this burden, this anger, that you never even loved me. I never stopped loving you. I had to let you go. You changed the meaning of love. Dev. Will you take care of yourself? I'll be eagerly waiting for your next book. Okay. Let's go. "You're the one that lights up my world." "You make my nights and dawn." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." Their love is out of the world. Those who are not destined to meet. "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." "You're the one that lights up my world." "You make my nights and dawn." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "You're like a tale..." "You're like a sonnet." "I want to keep hearing you night and day." "You're my peace of mind..." "...the cure to every pain." "I can't live a moment without you." "You're the one that lights up my world." "You make my nights and dawn." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." "We'll never part ways..." "Never... Never..." "What else can I say..." "To you..." "To you..."
