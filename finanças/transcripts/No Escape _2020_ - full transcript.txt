What up, kids? It's Cole. This is ERL. I just got out of the bathroom. And I am so high. 30,000-feet-in-the-air high! Sorry. Anyway, this month marks ten years of having doing this. Ten! What?! You better buckle those safety belts because ten years of filming is a ton of footage. And before we left on this trip, I went through all of it. Or most of it. Or some of it. There's just so much! Did you see that? It's hard to believe how many adventures we've been on together. Before any of that stuff, my parents were filming me. Cole, Cole, Cole. Watch out! Hold on. Hold on, buddy. All the time. - Hey, look. It's tiny me. - Happy birthday, Cole. Once I got my hands on a camera, I was filming everything. - Come on, Cole, you got it! - Oh! - Ouch. - Thomas, keep your eyes on the road. And when I got older, I started this channel and began sharing my videos with you and it blew up! Now I get to do this for a living! Which is nuts! I traveled all over the world, looking for the wildest experiences to entertain you guys. A 100,000... 250... Half a million followers. I'm in Brooklyn! Birmingham, Alabama. I'm in Detroit. ERL is in Nepal. You watched, commented... and told me what to do next. What up, kids, it's Cole. I challenge all of you to find something that scares me. I dare you! Come on! And I listened! Hey. Hi. OK, go, go. Shit. - Sir, you can't film here. - I'm not, it's not on. I'm in a coffin being buried alive. OK, it's not so bad. Hello? Oh, shit. Looking at all this crazy shit we've done together, and this escape from real life, none of this would've been possible - if it wasn't for this vlog and for all of you. - Shi... So thank you. Woo! All right, the nostalgia trip is over. So, if you remember back in August, we asked you to vote on where we should go to celebrate this amazing occasion. Over a million of you weighed in and... Moscow. My friends pulled all the stops and they hooked us up with first-class tickets! That's right! As usual, I'm taking you somewhere you've probably never been to show you something you've never seen. I know where we're going but I have no idea what we're doing because they won't tell me! - Dash! - Evening! - Samantha! - Yo. Yeah. Actually, Samantha wasn't supposed to be here because she's usually training for the X Games, But for the first time in forever, she didn't qualify. Ooh! Oh! - Ouch! - Fuck you, OK? Hey, hey, hey. Children are watching. - And... Erin is here! - Hi, guys! Yeah, it's her first time out of the states. - Are you serious? - Mm-hmm. Besides Mexico. Which does not count. But you can plan on seeing a lot more of her! Really? Yes, they will. So, we're almost there and then you kinda have to tell me, OK? I think I've waited long enough. OK. Not a chance. OK, fine. You know what? That's all for now. No, wait, wait, wait! - I'm turning this off. - Wait, wait. Get ready. Oh, my God! This is my best friend in the world, Thomas! Oh, yeah! First class. I see you, big dog. OK! Dude, wait, where were you this whole flight? Coach. I wanted it to be a surprise. Thank you so much. You guys are the best. Thanks, bro. Anything for you. - Here, let me get this. - OK. - All right. - Happy ten! - Happy ten years, buddy. - Love you, man! You guys are the best friends ever. Cheers! Oh, finally. He's finished. Oh, look who's done. All right. What the hell we doing? 'Cause, 'cause, like, come on. I've been waiting, so... you... you, like, tell me, like, for real. You gonna tell me, or...? All right. So... I have a buddy in Moscow named Alexei. This guy is next-level loaded. And when I told him you're coming, he watches ERL. Loves you, bro. He wants to take us everywhere. I'm talking the best clubs, the best restaurants, And when I mean "the best," this guy's so rich, that everything he does is legitimately the best. OK, OK. Clubs and restaurants, but like what are we actually doing there? - Are you done? - Yes, go ahead. Sorry. We are taking you to an escape room experience in Moscow. Seriously? You're serious? That's what it is? Yeah? We're flying all the way to Russia to go do an escape room? - I've been to escape rooms, man. Come on. - No, no. Yeah. Dude, I can't vlog an escape room. What are you, nuts? I get it, you been to an escape room but not one like this, bro. This one you have to be personally invited to. It's custom-made. It's scary as hell. And that means it's perfect for you. OK. No one else could do this. They built it for us. Swear to God. OK. OK! OK. OK. All right, say that one more time. You're taking me to an escape room? - We're... - For those of you who don't know what an escape room is, it's a game where they lock you and your friends in a room and you have to solve puzzles to try and get out. Why does that need to be explained? Oh, and they don't have the same rules we do, so... Exactly! Thank you. Which means, Cole, dear friend of mine, you can't be a pussy! Oh, dude! Come on, man! You know that I am up for anything! Oh! Give me that! You guys heard him, he said anything! Give it! All right. They're letting us tie into their cameras, which means, you guys are gonna be able to see it. OK. How do you know this Alexei guy? His dad is some politics or some shit, I don't even know. But the last time I met him, he was throwing around money like an idiot, bro. It was insane. We ended up on a yacht for, like, a fuckin' week. Oh, shit. Delete that last part. No, dude. This is live. Samantha's responsible for me. So there you go. Mystery revealed. A Russian escape room. What could possibly go wrong? This goin' be lit! Peace out, kids! "This 'gun be lit. Peace out, kids." Oh, yeah, you gonna have to delete that. Come on, bro. No, no, no. For real, though. How's that going over there? Mm-hmm. She's cool. - "She's cool"? - Yeah, dude. I see it all up in your face. You really care about her, don't you? Yeah, man. Like, you can tell? Like, right now? You can't hide that. White people do that. Ah, man. Yeah, no. She's... She's the first girl that I've been with who really sees me. You know? She's great. That's dope. I'm happy for you. Shit. Whoa! No, no, no, sir. Oh! You OK, babe? Hey, yo! We are in Russia, baby! And I have a quick question for my fellow friends. Have you ever wondered what's back there? No, not once ever. No. So, we all agree I should go back there? - No. - No, couldn't care less. OK, I'll be right back. - He plays too much. - Yo. Yo, Dash! Where'd he go? What is he doing? Dash, what are you doing? Oh, no. Oh, no. We lost Dash. OK. Cole? Cole? Whoa, hey. Whoa, whoa! Whoa, whoa, w-wait, wait. I swear to God, I wasn't gonna... Cole! W-wait, wait. Wait one second. Wh-what happened? Uh, sir. I... I... uh... I'm sorry, my friend's an idiot. One... one second. I... Hey, hey. Whoa. Oh. OK. Mm-hmm. Thank you. What's up, bud? Uh, I was throwing money around like, uh, like an idiot? Uh, no, no. Like, um, no, no, um... Come on! I'm fucking with you! But I do, huh? You're a legend, bro. This is Cole. - Cole. - Alexei. Welcome to Moscow. Thank you. Where's the rest? It's great to finally meet you, Cole, huh?

Personal driver and security. Now, they go everywhere that I go. - OK? It's very cool. - Now... Everybody, we go. Oh, yeah. That's it, Cole, you bringin' me on all those trips. This place is fucking amazing, huh? Come on. Who wants a drink? Only the best for you guys. Oh, what do we have here? - Dash... - France all over again. - Welcome. - Pleasure. Ooh, wow. Cole. OK. Everyone. Welcome to Russia. Huh? To Russia! What is this? Here we go. Yeah, this about to be dope! Oh, this doesn't look sketchy at all. Yo, Dash, this your scene, right? OK. OK. Erin, look. It's a real Russian club. Obviously. Oh! Whoa! Look at this! So much content! Whoa! Yo, Cole, you see that? Sam. How about this? Divide and conquer. Whoever gets the hottest girl wins. - Yes! - Oh, shit. We get our own table? H-hey, fire! Dude, this is sick! All right, so which one? - Her. The brunette. - That's easy. - Easy for what? - I could easily do that. So you're telling me, you could do that? Hell, not a chance in the world. You said it like I'm a joke. Oh, my God. We know each other very well. This is Mina. She's beautiful, isn't she? Yeah! What? Oh, shit. She's coming over. How you doin? Oh, a shot. We're gonna drink... Oh! Oh, this is happening. Samantha. All right, yup. I'm ready. Let's dance. Moscow! Whoo! Alexei, you drink like this every night? That's right! Hey... You party all the time, too. Come on! No, no. That's just for the camera, man. I remember the first time we got drunk. You remember that? - I do remember that. - Oh, shit! - Oh! - Sorry. OK, OK, OK. ERL is in the club! Hey, guys! So we came halfway around the world. What do you have planned for us? - You have never seen anything like it, OK? - OK. - Every experience is tailored to the player... - Hi, guys. Hi. Uh, we watch you all the time. Oh, you do? Oh, well, actually, we're live right now. Oh! All right, actually, hold on. It's... it's better, better by bar. Uh, I'm Alina. This is my sister, Alisa. It's nice to meet you. Hey, uh, Cole? Hold on one second, man. They watch my vlogs. All right. Where are you girls from? - St. Petersburg! - St. Petersburg! - I've never been there before. - You should come... Hey, uh, Cole. Well, maybe we should. Hey, Thomas, how far away is St. Petersburg from here? Cole, look! Cole! Hey, get your fucking hands off her! Oh, shit! Cole, Cole, stop! You don't know who these guys are. I don't give a fuck who they are... let go! Tell him stop! Motherfucker. You and your friends are fucked! I'm watching you, you bitch. - Hey, you OK? - Yeah. Who the fuck were those guys? Hey, you OK? - Yeah. Let's just go. - OK. Sorry about that. Let's get the fuck out of here. Let's go. Come on. Let's get the fuck out of here. Now. Go. - What was that? What the fuck? - Let it go. Come on. Ooh! I apologize for not coming sooner. I wouldn't know what would've happened if you didn't get there. I mean, like, who were those fuckin' guys? I feel like they knew Alexei or something. Those clubs are. How you say? A bad type. Mr. Koslov should know better. Well, thank you. For, you know... Thanks. Eh, I wonder if Alexei got any of that on camera. Sorry. I'm just glad that we're all... safe, you know? Cole. You've gotten used to all of these people following you and watching everything you do. And it's exciting. But I finally get to be a part of it with you. I'm not sure what these trips are normally like. But it looked like we were in real danger. And you were too busy with your fans to notice. That guy pulled a gun on us. And afterwards, I couldn't tell if you were more concerned about me or how many people were watching. I know there are two sides to you. The public Cole. And the real Cole. My Cole. They both have their place, but... I always thought you knew the difference. - Don't forget. At Dash. - OK. - Dash! Don't forget to call me back. Cool. - Mm-hmm. Good morning. - Morning! - Good morning. Morning, guys. Morning. How was last night? Now you know your boy can't drink. He's still in my room, asleep. Oh, he ended up in your room? I kicked him out of my place last night. You have no shame at all. No, no. Did you see her? Exactly. You would've done the same thing. Oh, I think Alexei's sending a car for us at two. Yeah. Oh, do you guys mind if I steal him for the day? - What?! No, I thought we were gonna go sight-seeing. - Absolutely. Thomas is not getting up no time soon. We can just do our own thing. Fine, whatever. Who needs you guys? We have a fireplace. We have a spa. We have room service. That's all paid for, yeah? Yeah, we don't need you guys. It's two o'clock. It's the only car here. I guess this ours? Obviously. Hi. Are you here for Cole...? Cole. Turner. Please, step inside. Um... Please, step inside. Thank you. That's so pretty. - Should we get out and walk? The Red Square's right up here. - Oh yeah. Mr. Alexei told me to stay with you. I wouldn't want to... Yeah, but that's OK. Stop right up here. Yeah, yeah, stop right up here. It's perfect. We'll meet you back here later. Uh, can you unlock the door, please? Can I just take you to the place I was told to take you? And then... She... she wants to see Red Square, and we're kinda tourists. So we'll meet back here later. OK. OK, I'll pick you up on the far side. Perfect. Baby, we haven't exchanged currency yet. Uh, do you know where we can get...? You don't have any rubles? How about 100 dollars? No worries. Most places will not take credit. Thanks, bro. I need to have you by eight! You... So it's 6:15 here, that means at home it's... 8:15 AM. I always keep the watch on LA time. Ha! You're so weird. I thought I'd have terrible jet lag and... Mm. Everything last night. Hm. Oh, that bed was so comfy. I slept like a rock. Me, too. I'm glad I get you almost to myself today. So am I. This was good. I'm glad we stumbled in here. Imagine that. Oh, my God. Not having to ask anyone. - I mean, I'm actually really proud of you. - Thank you. - How will anyone even know that we were here? - I don't know. I mean, that we had so much fun? And it was so beautiful. OK. OK. Oh. Thank you. Hey, uh, how much, uh... What's wrong? Well, it's not US dollars. Cole? Do you have cash? Uh,. Do I have enough cash? OK. Oops. Looks like it. You're really cool. Thanks. You get that a lot? I do. Yeah, you clearly like the lifestyle. I get it. I'm slowly picking up on that. I'm Russian-rich. Um, Mr. Koslov has taken care of your meal and the driver is waiting outside. Wait, Alexei? OK. Oh! This is yours. Huh? What is this? Mm. Hey. How did Alexei even know where we are? I don't know. Is that cool or creepy? Uh, yeah, A little, yeah. Excited for tonight? You know me, I'm gonna hype anything. But I hope that it is big enough. No, I wouldn't worry about that. Like, just wait. Oh, my... Cole. Yeah? What? This is all for you. So if tonight gets too intense, I hope you know... Too intense? We're going to an escape room. Come on. Stop. All right. What? OK. Do you remember who you're talking to right now? Oh, shut up. Come on, let's go. Actually, hold on. Wait, for real. Hey, kids. It's Cole. I just wanted to hop on really fast and thank everybody so much for their suggestions. AlisaV34, the Bolshoi was mmm... Amazing! Yes! And I don't know why everybody shit-talks Russia so much, besides all the guns and gangsters, actually not that bad. It's not! You know. OK? So anyway, in three hours, we will be going live from this mysterious escape room. See what happens 9 PM Moscow time. - Let's go. - And we out! - This is stupid. - OK, OK. Oh, actually... Hey, thank you so much. No, Mr. Cole. Uh, you keep it. I... I insist, please. You keep it. Please. Oh. Shit! You two ready? What? Hey. - Are you OK? - Yeah. He didn't give you any trouble, did he? 'Cause I will fucking fire him. No, no, no. It's no big deal. - Want to stay here? I should get changed before we go. Yeah, yeah, sounds good. OK, then. I am so happy for you. I wish I could go again. You can't go twice? No. This is all he could talk about for a month after we went. About how intense it was. And how it gave him life. Hey. OK? Yeah? Hey, man. What'd you get into today? Oh. Room service. Fire. I got a massage. I know you're jealous. I know. I'm on vacation, baby. About to get ready for tonight. - Hey. - Hm. Oh, this place is fire. Oh, yup, this has got me out. OK, now. Remember. As real as everything might seem, OK? You're safe. OK? That's dramatic. Let's do it. - Yeah? - Yeah. OK. OK. Not sketchy at all. Tonight! In true ERL fashion, we are taking you to the most intense, the most hyper-exclusive, escape room in Moscow. That's right! Just for you, they're letting us tie into their cameras so you all can watch what's happening live. And because every experience is completely different, You never know what's gonna happen! Oh, my God. Alexei, come here, come here. Is there any way they can find this place online Do you have a website? Do you have a profile? Do you have a hashtag? Do you have any... - No. - No, you don't! Because ERL is the only place you can get this content. That's right! Uh! You guys ready or what? - Not as much as you. Jesus Christ! - All right, let's do this. OK, Cole, they will begin streaming it - directly into your device. - Let's do it. OK. All right. Don't lose that. Don't lose that phone. They are good to go. My backup phone. Hope they don't find all my nudes. Just kidding, just kidding. Erin, stop. It's a joke. But how much fun would they be? - Scared? - No. So, what do you think they're doing? I don't got a clue. It's like that. Fuck. Who are these guys? They'll be taking you inside. But they only speak Russian. So I told them I'd give you instructions in English. You're being held in a Bolshevik prison. This is a facility where enemies of the state were tortured, questioned and killed. The last man executed is still inside. He stole the cell block key and hid it in the only place he could. They tortured him. Starved him. But he never gave it up. You must release your companions before the timer runs out. And they are executed. Fuck. What? This is crazy. Ugh. Yo, guys, this place is legit. Hey, Cole! Yeah? Is anybody else down here? Yeah, me. I'm... I'm strapped into some kind of... machine. OK. Ugh. Cole! OK, hang tight! OK. Oof. This guy real? Holy shit. I think I'm supposed to cut this guy open? This is really weird. Super creepy. I, uh, am feeling a little weird about it. No one's gonna stop me? Oh, my goodness. I got this. All right. This is so sketch. All right. I'm gonna do it. Oh, shit. Ugh. Ew, weird. Uh... I don't know what I'm looking for. OK, it's not there. Sorry, man, it's weird for me, too. This is so sick. Oh. Oh! Ugh. Erin! Erin! Are you OK? This is so fuckin' crazy. The key. The key. I don't know what to do. Hello! OK. I'll be right back. OK. Hey, Sam. How you doin'? Nice to see you doin' good. Man, this shit is uncomfortable. Hey, Alexei was not joking. Do you guys think this is a real prison? I think it's a real prison. Ha ha! I told you! Oh, so you guys are watching. Better get going, baby face. Your friends don't have much time left. Baby face. Hey, everybody. I'm gonna solve all these puzzles quick. Watch this. Hey, something's happening down here. 'Kay, coming. Hey, seriously. Get down here, man. This is starting to hurt. Finally. Wow. Look at you guys. Where's Erin and Sam? You guys are all in different torture devices. Sam's in an electric chair, and Erin is down there in some sort of a tank? Oh, OK. Yo, what happened to your hands? The key that I used to get in here, I had to cut out of a guy's stomach! This is blood! Like a real dude? Yes, Dash. Like a real dead Russian. From the war. No! I don't know, man! I don't know. - I don't know. - Crazy. I mean, look where we are. You had me, though. Not gonna lie. You had me. Guys. O-OK, serious, though. Uh, when that door opened, this started pulling. - This door? - Hey! This thing right here is starting to close. O-OK. Uh, each of the rooms across from you guys have puzzles and those are the only doors that are open. I guess I just need to solve them and... and I'll get you guys out. Just stay right there. Don't move. OK. I mean, we can't go anywhere but, yeah. - Hang tight. - Cole! - I know. - Jesus! Huh. So these probably connect to Dash's cell. And then there's more in that room. Huh. OK, please hurry. Hey... Yo, where are you going, bro? These things are sharp! You'll be fine. Hurry! Oh, yeah. What up, kids? I'm using gears to solve puzzles to save my friends' lives. - Lives are at stake. - Hey, Cole! Yeah, buddy. I don't mean to sound like a wimp but this is starting to get uncomfortable. Aww, Thomas. - Is this a little scawy for you? - Man, whatever, G. You sound like a wimp! I'm gonna need you to hang tight. Oh! Ah! Oh, boy. Hold on! This is gonna be a piece of cake. What was that? Sorry. Sorry. OK, all right. Dude, these things are coming close. I think now's a good time to let you guys know I'm claustrophobic. Yup! I think it's this one. Cole, it's tightening! Oh! Cole! I got it. Get me out of this shit! Oh! Uh, yeah, man. You probably should speed up for his sake. OK, whoa. Whoa. Yeah, hold on! Whatever you did, don't do it. It's getting faster! It's getting faster! Yes! Almost done! Yo, where are you going? Where are you running? I gotta do the other side! Seriously, this is starting to hurt! So heavy, dude. Hold on. OK, whoa. Whoa. Uh, this is not OK. Oh, dammit! Ah! Fix my shit first! OK, OK, OK... B-b-b-b-b-back! Ooh-ooh. Great. OK. This is starting to get a little fucking painful! Hey, Thomas, hold on! Hold on! B-b-b-b-b-b! Whoa-whoa-whoa! Last one! Oh! Ooh-oh. Oh! Oh, shit. Thank God. That was way too fucking close. Oh. It worked. Guys! I think I did it. Let me tell you how claustrophobic I was getting. All right! Thomasito, I'm coming for ya. Cole, get me out of this shit. I know Alexei said this was gonna hurt, but that shit was intense. Look, we're running out of time. Oh, you better get moving, guys. Even he saw that. Come on. Phantom Alexei. Get this shit over with. Oh, God. This is even kinky for you. - I'm not gonna lie. - Just get me out of here. - We can't hear you. - Get me out of here! Guys, I ain't fucking... Just come on, man. All right. We'll be back. Unless you don't want us to help you. Do you need help? Come on, man. Fuck you, man. - What? - Nothing. Get me out of here! You... you like the chair? You like... - You play too much, come on! - What? All right, this looks pretty straight-forward. Yeah. - It's just a maze. - Duh, it's a maze, Cole. This is pretty cool, though. OK, so... You gotta go this way, yeah? I guess it goes around? Damn! Whoa! Yo. I think you just shocked her. Hey, you should be more careful with that, huh? Oh, OK. Let me see this. Move, move, move. Yeah, but, hey. But did you hear what they said? - Yeah. - You got to be careful. - Be careful. - Guys, guys. Come on. Let's get out of here. All right. OK. All right, so what'd you do to shock her? You just... that? Oh ho. Whoops! Easy, easy, easy. This is crazy. Look. Dash! Dash, stop! Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa. - Stop, guys! Easy! - Thomas, relax. -Yo, what the fuck? Look! I think it's actually hurting her! Relax, bro! It's a game! Samantha, is this hurting you? Should we get them to stop this game? What the fuck? Here, give it to me. - Be easy! - Stop! No! Let go. - It goes this way. - I know where it goes. I'm just tryin' to tell you, I mapped it already. - Make a right! - It's all right, I got it. Be quick about it. Make a right. No! Come on, come on! Easy, there. You got a right. - Easy, easy! - Sorry, sorry, sorry. Left. OK! Make a right. Shit. You got a right, and then a left. You guys, how you doing in there? I'm trying, shut up! I'm trying to help you! Now you gotta make a right up here and then a left. Come on, you got it. You're close, you're close, you're close. - H-hey! - You got it! Let's go! Get this off me, man. What just happened? I'm so sorry, Sam. How bad was that? I feel sick. That shit wasn't right, man. That shit wasn't right at all. Well, Alexei said that this was gonna be pretty intense. - Fuckin' Alexei, man. - This place is pretty intense. Y'all think this is funny, huh? Yo, yo, Sam. It's a game. It's supposed to be... Fuck that, Cole! This shit don't feel like no game no more, man. Sam, if you want to leave, we can just leave right now. You know I want to leave, man. I don't wanna stay here no more, Dashell. I wanna go! Look, why is nobody answering us? I don't know. Alexei, hello?! Guys! Hello?! Hello?! What do you mean you don't know? This is your guy. - You were just talkin' to him. - yeah. Where's he at now? I don't know him all that well! - What do you mean you don't know him that well? - What? I don't know, I met him and he said he loved his vlogs. He's some rich guy. He said he did this before. There's no way this kid did this, man. I don't know what to tell you guys. All I know is just as much as you guys. They change it every single time. It's intense. But it's a game! Dash. We're in Russia with some guy that you barely know in some old prison? Or wherever we are. Are you fucking crazy? How could I be so stupid? - This is so like you. - What do you mean? Fuck... Fuck you! What do you mean "it's like" me? You came on this trip, too. Just fucking chill. He's probably laughing at you right now. He's messing with us. He's not messing with us, Dash. Guys? What?! Get over here. Oh, my God. Erin! - Shit! - Erin, are you OK? How long do you think it's gonna take to fill up? I don't know, if she's OK... Are you OK?! She doesn't know what's going on. She didn't even see what happened to me. - That's true. - I don't think she can even hear us. Erin! Can you hear us?! Cole. Can you hear her? Fuck! All right, where did you guys just start from? From down there. Our devices hurt but not as bad as that electric chair. I bet. Alexei, what gives, bro?! What's next? Are you even there? Hello?! Dash, they're not gonna help us. We're on our own. OK. This is just like the other rooms. We need to figure it out and get her out now! Now, now, now! We're gonna be right back! Uh... What the hell is this? Ugh. OK. Uh, three L, five L Well, it's like that thing from Die Hard. I mean, then we also did it at school once, too. What? Come on, man. We used to love that movie. It's an old puzzle. Well, just, get her out of there, OK? - Let's solve it and get her out. - All right. OK, I got this, guys. Use the three-liter jug and the five-liter jug to get precisely four liters of water. So first we need to fill up the five-liter jug. How she doing over there? She's not freaking out, so that's good. Great. Now we pour the five-liter jug into the three-liter jug. We need to fill that all the way up. Help me out here. That's in the three-liter. Try to help me, all right. Thank you. Careful, we can't waste any of this. All right, stop. Now. That leaves us with two liters of water in the five-liter jug. So now we need to empty out the entire three-liter jug. Um... Come on, Thomas. Great. Now quickly. Let's put the two liters in the three-liter jug. Help me out again? Great, keep going. Yup. - All right. - OK. Sweet! All right. Now two liters are in the three-liter jug, OK? Which gives us room for one more liter. Let's fill up the five-liter jug... All right. Now time to top off the three-liter jug. Last step, guys. Come on. Thank you. You remember all this from Die Hard? And perfect. Stop! All right, great. That should leave us with exactly four liters of water in the five liter jug. - Come on, Thomas. - How are we lookin'? How's Erin doing? You're really cuttin' it close. I know, I know. Hold on. There. - Oh, my God, Erin! - Shit! Erin! Are you OK? All right, we need to get her out of here. How are we supposed to do that?! This is the key! The key, the key, uh... Is there a latch or something? - I don't see anything. - I don't see any. Hey, there's a hatch on top! OK, uh... Here, grab one! - Dash! - She has the key. Hold on. It's rusted shut! What do you mean it's rusted shut? - It's rusted shut, man! - It's not rusted shut! - Just pull harder! - That's what I'm doing, man! Turn it! Turn it at the same time. Come on! God, fuck! Oh, my God. Come on! Ah, it should be fucking opening! What's going on? She's gonna fucking drown! Find something to break this open, Cole! Erin! Fuck. I don't know what to do. I don't know what to do. I know. Cole, she's gonna fucking drown! Alexei, what the fuck! That's enough! Stop the game! We can't get her out! Alexei! Victoria! Stop the game! We can't get her out! Fuck! Alexei! Anyone? Fuck! Alexei! Anyone! Erin! No, no, no, no! Alexei! Where the fuck are you?! Fuck, man. We're never gonna get this off! Shit. Shit. Move! Move! Fuck! Erin! Help me! Help me! Help me! Erin! Help me! Yeah. Oh, God. Erin! Erin! Erin! Slow, slow, slow. Watch her head. I don't know. Erin! Erin! Oh, my God. Erin! - Erin! - She's not breathing! What do we do? Give her mouth-to-mouth! Oh, my God! Oh! Oh, my God! Oh! Get her up, get her up, get her up. Thank God you're OK. Thank God, thank God. What the fuck is that? Is it over? Fuck that. Are you OK? I'm OK. - OK, OK. She... - I'm OK - You good? - Uh-huh. OK. Fuck! I don't get it. Why the fuck didn't they come? Why did they say? I tried to... I... We couldn't do anything! Because Alexei was helping us and then he was just gone! We was yellin' to them the whole entire time, Erin. We... we... Let's go. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Wait, hey, hey. That's... that's gotta be the key for the end of the hall. Yeah, let's go. Let's go. - Can you get up? - Mm-hmm. Fuck this place. Alexei, what the fuck? What the fuck? Whoa, shit! Alexei? Hello? What the hell is this? Alexei? Dash, the door, the door! - Fuck! - Fuck! No, no. What happened here? I... I don't know. But whatever it was, it was bad. - We were just talking to Alexei and then he stopped. - OK. What if this is still part of it? No, fuck, no. We lost. Look at the timer. It's over. Someone should be here. Someone should've been here a long time ago after what happened in there. Maybe the audience saw it on my feed and they're sending help or... I don't think so. I don't see any cameras. - There's blood on the wall. - What?! Fuck! - Cole! What do we do? What do we do? Uh, I don't know. Uh... It's jammed, the door's locked! This won't open either. OK, hold on. Let me try. - Shit! - OK, think. Maybe we can break the lock. OK, hold... Maybe we should stay here. If there's actual danger, this is the best place to be. We'll just wait for the security to come back. Yeah, he's right. That makes sense. What are you doing? Cole. Cole! Cole! Wait! No! Dude, what the fuck?! We're getting out of there now. Fuck that, I'm not going out there. None of us should. Everybody, listen. We don't have any identification. We are in a strange country. We don't have our phones, our wallets, our passports, anything. We need to leave now! We're gonna stick together and find help! Oh, what the fuck?! Oh, my God. No, no, no! Wait! Oh, my God! Erin? Thomas? What are you doing to us? What do you want? Where's Alexei? What do you want with us? Let go of me! Where are my friends? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Hello, Cole. Who... who is that? How do you know my name? Who are you? What is this? Oh, my God. Please, please, please. You fucking Americans. This is... this is a mistake. You think you're so safe? M-misunderstanding. Mm? I don't know... I don't know who you are. When a man is shot in the head, there's so much blood. Nothing can prepare you for it. It goes everywhere. Who am I? I'll show you who I am. Bam! Fuck! My friends and I were just visiting, having fun. We went to a club, I... I don't know what happened. We just want to go home. Please, please, please. What is this? Are you broadcasting this? Exclusive. American Huh? Celebrity! Celebrity. No. Gah! You know how much they pay to watch people like you get torn apart piece by piece? - They love to watch. - No! What are you doing? They love to decide how we do it. Oh, please. No! And first up, is the girl! No, don't you fucking... Don't you fucking touch her! No, no, please. We'll kill one of you every half hour. No! No! No, no, no, please! Please, please! Oh, my God. Fuck! Oh, my God. Oh, my God! What the fuck are you doing, man? Come on, man. We can work this out... Are you fuckin' filming this? I promise if you let me out of here, I'm gonna fuck you up, man! What is all that stuff you're sayin', man? Man, what are you doing, man? Huh? What's all of that? One of you guys gotta speak English. Talk to me! Fuck! Come on, man! Come on! No. Just chill... The fuck you gonna do with that? No, no, no! Please stop! No. Fuck you! My fuckin' eye! Now, come on. Come on, come on. Please stop! Goddamn it! Oh, shit. Ow! What do you want? Dash. What? What the fuck? What are you talking...? And you, been chosen. What if... what if we talk about this, man? What if I could do something? - Like you... - You know I have a lot of... ...you have audience, I have audience. OK. Mine is just a little more selective than yours. We can talk about this. You don't have to fuckin' do this. What the fuck are you doing? You know how much they pay for an American? Huh? They love to watch. You have any preferences? Fuck you! Fuck you! They've chosen. Still alive? Final words? I can't help it. I enjoy this. Fuck. Oh, my God. Mister Cole, I'm so glad you found... You! What the fuck is this? No! Please, no, no, no, no. I have been trying to help you. Help me? You're the fucking driver. What is this? Listen to me! I couldn't say nothing earlier because he is always watching. Who? Who is always watching? There's no time. Please. You need to go. Please! You need to go, right now! Go where? What the fuck? What about my friends? There is no help for your friends. You have the chance to escape. Take my car. Please, go. They are coming! - Who's coming? - They are coming! Go! Why are you helping me? Hide! Thomas. Holy shit. You're alive. Cole? I'm gonna get you out of here. You OK? - I'm so glad you're here. - What did they do to you? Oh, your face. I can't see shit, Cole. Wait, wait. Can you walk? Yeah, yeah. OK. Go, go over here. Go, go, go! Go, go, go, go! Cole, Cole, Cole. I can't see. Oh, yeah, OK. Shh. Sorry. Oh, my God. What are they doing to us? Torturing us. People are paying to watch. Sam and Dash are... Sam and Dash are what? They're gone. I couldn't do anything, Thomas. They died right in front of me. Have you seen Erin? No. How do you get these things off? They took mine off. I was put in rusty handcuffs. Broke mine off when I pulled this. OK, wait, stay here. I'm gonna find something to break those. Yeah. Shh! Well, where the hell do you think it goes? I don't know. I'll guide you. Just trust me. All right, let's go. - Up here. - Where are we going? I'll help you up. OK, OK. Stay here. Someone's coming. Someone's coming. Come on, Thomas. OK, OK. There's gotta be some way out of here. What do we do? Can we turn this on? Fuck! Cole! Oh, fuck. Hey! Erin? Stop! Stop! No further. No further. Let her go or I'll fucking shoot you. I don't think so. One more move and I kill her. Please let her go. I will do whatever you want. We... we didn't do anything to you. Please let her go. My men will come rushing through the door any second. No! I'm so sorry. What the fuck is this? What the fuck are you doing? What do you want? Do you want money? I will give you... I'll pay you. I'll give you all my money. Please, please, let her go. They pay me more. You think you're fast enough? Huh? Cole... Do it! Oy. Do it! I love you. Wait! Erin! No, no, no! Oh, my God. Fuck! Cole... How does it feel to lose everything, huh? Motherfucker! Come on. Hey, hey, hey, Cole. How could you do that to them? - Hey, hey, Cole, please! - Fuck you! Let me explain! Fuckin' piece of... I'll kill you! I'll fuckin' kill you! Fuckin' piece of shit. We trusted you, you motherfucker! It's not real! They're all... they're all... So in three months, my friends and I are gonna be doing something special. They promised me it's gonna be amazing. Thank you all so much for watching, for voting, and for following. Yeah, we got drinks, motherfucker! Every experience is tailored to the player. Oh, my God. Oh, my... I need to have you back by eight! This is yours. That's enough! Stop the game! We can't get her out! Oh, my God. Where are you! Help! Fuck! Erin, Samantha, Dash. We're taking you... So sick! Ah! What the fuck? Hey, babe. Where are you? Oh, great, you're almost here. We'll see you in a second. Bye. He just pulled in the driveway. You want anything? No, I'm good. FaceTime Thomas. - Hey, what up, Dash? - All right, so he still doesn't know. So just tell everybody to keep it on the low. Dude, this is gonna be crazy. He's not gonna even see it coming. When's the last time you guys even seen each other? Must've been some years, bro. OK, I'm gonna have to let you go. He's coming. OK, sounds good. I'll see you soon. All right, see you, bud. What's up, guys? Dash here. And check this out. - We just picked up Thomas! - Hey! He still has no idea. We got Alexei. Hey. See you soon. It'll be so crazy. Oh, my gosh. I can't believe he just has no idea. - You don't think he does? - What's up? He's gonna know that this is fake. He won't, trust me. I'm taking care of everything. Aren't we worried this isn't too much? He's always looking for something to actually scare him, right? If we pull this off, this is it. There's no turning back now. Remember, dude. We love you. This is crazy even for you. You'll love it, bro. - All right, man, good luck. - Peace. Peace.
