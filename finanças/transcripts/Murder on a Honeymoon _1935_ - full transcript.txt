- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes What are you scared of, girlie? Open your eyes. Not until we've left the ground. We've left it, lady, every inch of it. It's all right, really. Where'd you think you were? In an unexpected conversation with another stranger. My name's Forrest, sorry. Mine's Withers, Hildegarde Withers, and I'm not sorry. I've always been proud of it. Withers... Withers? Sounds familiar. Pride of a horse. I've always enjoyed that remark from my pupils. Just the sort of humor one can expect from a twelve-year-old mind. Mustn't be fresh with teacher, Mister, er... Mister, er... Beegle, Beegle! Beegle? Hm! A short-legged hound with long drooping ears. - Oh, Marvie! - Oh now, don't be afraid, darling. Your Marvie's right here with you. It's perfectly safe, sweetheart. Say, look, folks, the whole United States Navy's down there. Yes, look, Kay, here's a chance you may never have again. - Oh, I'm sorry. - Oh, no. If the ill wind doesn't blow us someone could. Call again. Say. Am I speaking to Joseph B. Tate the motion picture director? - You are, unfortunately. - Well, what do you think of that? - Have a cigarette, Mr. Tate. - No, thank you. - Rialto Clubs. - No, thank you. You know, I just flew in from New York and while there I saw your last picture. - I thought it was... - Well, I'm working on my next one now. Would you mind letting me continue? Why sure. Is that really Mr. Tate? I've never met a moving picture director before. I'm going to meet this one, that's why I'm here. He's going to give me a job in his next picture. Only he doesn't know it yet. - Well, then how are you going to... - Watch. Oh! I'm... so... sorry, Mr. Tate. That's quite all right. I'm afraid it's rather crowded in here. Yes, it is. Just like your office at the studio. Only here you can be seen. Oh, come, that's a little cruel. Are you in pictures? Yes, only I've never been in any of yours. And they're the ones that count, you know. Thank you. Perhaps someday you will be. Oh, thank you! - Get the guy that's smoking. - Okay. Sorry, sir, no smoking in the plane, I'll take that. Okay. When do we get in? Oh, in a little minute now. What's the matter, you a little airsick? Who me? Don't be silly. I took care of him. Here, have some gum. No, thanks. What you need is a drink. Here, have some of this. Oh... Oh... I'm dying! Let me out of here! - I'm dying! - Here, here, here. - Get me out of here! - Pull yourself together. We're landing shortly. You're alright. Here, try these smelling salts. Well, the water's smoother than the air. Oh, there's the cassino. - Here we go. - Let her down. - Hello, Don. - Hiya, Jack. - Hiya, Jake. - Boy, it was rough. - Good morning, Mr. Tate. - Good morning, Cox. I have a car waiting for you right out here. - See after my baggage, will you? - It'll be taken care of, goodbye. - It's all right. - Oh, is it? Did you enjoy the trip? Oh, the trip was all right, all except that Forrest person. That man! Forrest. He's dead! - Oh, how awful! - Don't cry, Kay. - But on our honeymoon! - It won't do any good to be upset. - I'd take her to a bus. - Come on, honey. Hey, Jack, get a car! - He's dead alright. - He must have died of heart failure. Nonsense, he flew all the way from New York without dying. Why should he have a heart attack on a short trip like this? If you want my opinion, it's very strange. We don't want your opinion, thank you. Come on, let's get him out of here. At least you ought to let the coroner and the police see him. The doctor'll see him. Poor child, it must have been a shock to you. Did you notice anything peculiar about the trip? No. Only a guy dropped dead, that's all. - Oh! I forgot something! - What is it? This! That's Mr. Jones. What an odd name for a dog. That was the name of the guy who gave him to me. It was all he had. - Are you ladies going to St. Catherine? - Yes. - The bus leaves right away. - Okay. Mr. Jones! - Drop me at the chief of police's office. - Huh? You heard me. Keep your tackle clean and dry and she'll last forever. How long does it take the police doctor to make an examination? Oh, he'll be out soon. I think it's a waste of time for you to wait, though. Hold it a little tighter, please. I thought I explained to you, Mr. Britt, just why I think this death demands an investigation. Well, I've been Chief of Police here for nine years... ...and I'm sure that it was just plain natural death. We never had a murder on the Island. In fact, people don't die here very often. Maybe they die and you don't know it. If you don't mind, I think I'll wait. Mind? Hey... You're being a big help to me. That's nice, I'm really glad. Here you are, Chief. Here are all of his effects. Not a sign of paralysis. You can just write it down to just plain heart failure. - You see? - Are you quite capable of judging? Well I ought to be, I am a doctor. Well... I took you for a lifeguard. I gave him a very thorough examination. I can imagine. I resent your attitude, madam! Don't try to be impressive in that rig, my man. You can't frighten me until you put on your trousers. At least there should be a post mortem. Do you mind telling me, madam, just why you seem so interested in this case? - Are you a relative? - I never saw the man before. But I do know signs of poison and murder. Ah, a reader of detective stories. I worked with a detective on two murder cases. Inspector Piper of the New York Police. He's no great shakes himself, but he's a giant compared to... ...some I've seen since. And now, Doctor, don't you really think that you'd better... - You mean... - I mean that the whole thing... will have a more professional angle if you... I am going to stay right where I am. I have my own dignity as a physician to defend. The name seems to be Roswell Forrest. This letter's addressed to him at Hotel Senator, Los Angeles. You didn't notice possibly that the letter is unopened? Why, sure, I noticed it. He probably was in such a rush to make the plane he didn't have time to read it. And if you don't mind reading other people's mail, don't you think would you might read it? Or don't you read? I'll read it... I'll read it, don't worry. "Roswell," "Graber and the whole ring are out to get you." "A guy named MacArthur is on the job." "Not sure he knows where you are." "But watch out if any of them show up." "We'll keep you posted. Regards." "Fishbein." So he died from heart failure. The man that died in the plane, is his body here? - Yes, what about it? - My name's Kelsey. I was expecting my employer on the plane, but he didn't show up. And when I found out that a man had died... - I wonder if I could see who it is. - Certainly. Right this way. That's Forrest all right. How did it happen? Didn't he know he was subject to paralytic strokes? Well, yes, now that you've mentioned it. The doctors told him if he had another one, he'd be dead. Well, he's dead. This doctor says there wasn't a trace of paralysis. He says it was heart failure. Mr. Forrest also suffered from heart failure, I suppose? - Of course there's always murder. - Murder? Well, yes, there is always murder. Sensible man, he faces facts. Possibly some of the other passengers may have ideas on the subject. - Or wouldn't you want to embarrass them? - It won't do any harm to talk to them. I'll have them brought to my office this afternoon. Any time will do, so long as it's before the cold weather sets in. - Where's the telegraph office? - It's just around the corner. Well, doctor, you can put on your trousers. And I feel that your unwarranted criticism... besmirches the fair name of the entire Police Department... ...of the city of New York. Yours truly, Oscar Piper. Inspector of Police and so forth, and so forth, and so forth. That ought to shut him up. Come in. Telegram for you, Inspector. Well, thanks! Fine way to deliver a telegram. They'll be hurdling vitriol in your face next. Hey, it's from Hildegarde Withers. Oh, is she still assisting you? Sure... What do you mean "assisting me"? She never assisted me. Nosy old dame, I laughed quite a lot around her, that's all. She's in business for herself, get this. "Dear friend, colon. Enjoying vacation, period." "Have murder case of my own to work on, period." "Please send all available information on, quote," "Roswell T. Forrest, comma, unquote," "the deceased, period." "Sincerely, comma, Hildegarde Martha Withers, period." "The deceased"! There's the schoolteacher for you. Forrest! Say, that's the guy the State's Attorney's been looking for. That's right, the key witness against the Graber mob. Sure, they've been gunning for him to keep him from testifying against them. They must have caught up with him. If she happens on any proof that they've done it, they'll bump her off like that. Give me the commissioner. Yeah. Hello, Commissioner? Inspector Piper speaking. I located Roswell T. Forrest in California. No, murdered. Yeah. Okay and thanks. Are you going to handle the case? You bet your life I am. He says to take the afternoon plane for the Coast. That'll put me in Catalina at noon tomorrow. And if I can only pin Forrest's murder on the Graber mob, we've got them. Gee, I hope Hildegarde is alright. Hey listen, you. Dig out a complete file on Forrest and airmail it to me. Yeah, but Forrest didn't have any criminal record, did he? Well, alright, get it from the State's Attorney. And wire the chief of police at Catalina... ...and give them all the dope. I'll wire Hildegarde, understand? Gee, I can't let her stick out her neck like this. I thought you didn't like her. What are you talking about? That battle-axe is the best friend I got in the world. D'you need any more chairs, Mr. Chief? I guess that's enough. The only one who isn't here is Mr. Tate. Um, Mr. Britt. Here is a list of all the people on the plane. Names, addresses and occupations. Well thanks for going to so much trouble. Yeah, meddling's a pleasure for some people. It says here, Mr. Beegle, that you're retired. - Did you ever do anything? - Well, if it's anybody's affair, I was the captain of a rum runner. When my business was repealed, I decided to settle down on my winnings. - I'm gonna do some fishing. - Swordfish? - Yeah. - Say! They're running swell off of San Diego now. I could show you... Pardon me! Could you spare a few moments with this investigation? Oh, yes! You're all under suspicion. Remember that. Forcible imposition, this. This is a great outrage, I tell you! Sorry, tell it to the chief. What's the idea of all this? You can't arrest me. You aren't under arrest, Mr. Tate. Then what's the idea of dragging me down here? I've got a company on location. Hundreds of people are waiting for me. Hundreds of thousands of dollars are tied up while I stand here. Sit down, Mr. Tate, we won't take more than ten thousand dollars of your time. Now. Madden, have you anything to report? No, sir. Nineteen minutes' flying time. Unusually bumpy air. I think that's what made him sick. And he was smoking too. I think it was something he ate before he got on the plane. - That's possible. - Oh... Well, um... did... did anyone give him anything during the trip? Or see anyone give him anything? I offered him some gum, but he wouldn't take it. Mr. Britt, I saw... That is, I mean, um... Mr. Tate, you gave him a drink from your flask, didn't you? Why... yes, I did. There could have been poisoned liquor in that flask, Mr. Tate. No, no... It... it wasn't. It was absolutely good liquor. He was taken violently ill after you gave him that drink, wasn't he? - I guess so. - Have you got that flask here? Well... no, I left it on location. Why, his liquor couldn't have been poisoned. He took a slug of it himself... ...after the other guy got through. And he wasn't poisoned. Yes, that's right. Thanks... thanks. Now that we're getting snoopy, nobody else took a whiff of those smelling salts that you gave him. You're quite right, Mr. Beegle. Yeah, you can take it too, huh? Here, Doctor. I regret to say it is not poisoned. You'd better well forget this murder idea, Miss Withers. - Your theory is a lot of nonsense. - Oh, is it? - You've overlooked one item, Mr. Britt. - What? If it wasn't the liquor, you'll find that those cigarettes he smoked are poisoned. Marvin, I smoked one of them! - I didn't know! - Hey, darling, calm down... Wait a minute! There's nothing wrong with this girl. You with your talk of poison cigarettes. There's not a sign of poison. It's all right, Kay darling, you'll be all right. - Then why did she say... - I'm sick and tired of all this insanity. So am I! Make out a certificate of natural death. And ship the body back to mainland. - I'll take charge of it. - Okay. The rest of you folks can go where you please. I'm sorry all this happened. Mr. Chief. Here's a couple of telegrams for y'all. - Mr. Tate! - For you, Miss Withers. Mr. Tate, could you drop me off at the hotel? I'm sorry, I'm going right back to location. I'm taking a taxi there, will you join me? Yes, I'd be glad to. Wait a minute! This telegram changes things. You can all go to your hotels, but you got to stay here right here on the island. Aw... Is your telegram from Inspector Piper? - Yes. - So is mine, listen. "Please hold body and all suspects." "Arriving tomorrow morning." "Case important to New York Police." "Have learned that crime ring offered $10,000 for Forrest's death." "Someone heard it. Inspector Piper." Does this faintly suggest murder to you now? Yes, it does. But still it's a mystery. You put things so clearly, Mr. Britt. Wait a minute! But how was he murdered? You keep in touch with me and I'll let you know. Anyone in that plane could have given him the poison. - Please! - I'm sorry, lady, I'm sorry. That's all right. You, um... You have much trouble with pests. Yes, I do, lady. But you go right ahead, that's what I'm here for. Just a minute, Mr. Tate, let me do some of the talking. Or would you rather I talked to them? Now listen, you're being unreasonable about all this. You wouldn't want that to happen, would you? No, honestly, I'll phone the studio and see what I can do. Forget it, I've heard that kind of stalling before. But you'd better make up your mind or I'll spill the works. - I'll tell the police. - Now, listen, I'm giving you the part. All you've got to do is to keep your mouth shut. Blackmail! Stay right where you are, Withers, or I'll shoot! Don't move. Put your hands over your head. What are you doing, playing squat tag? Oscar Piper. Little moments in the lives of great detectives. Hildegarde, you get screwier every day. Come all the way from New York just to be stupid in new surroundings? I came all that way to keep you from getting knocked off. You put yourself on a spot, you know that, don't you? That's no excuse for sneaking up on a lady from behind. Well, I'm sorry, Hildegarde. Well, just so long as you don't make a habit of it. Well, what were you hiding behind that bush for anyway? This is not a bush. It's a species of cocos plumosus. Palm tree to you. And I was not behind it, I was beside it. What ever I was trying to do, you spoiled it. Never give it a thought. After I look things over, I'll probably work the case all out for you as usual. Like that. Like that? You're really remarkable, Oscar. I mean, with your fingers. Oh, you're gonna start that, are you? Well, where's the corpse? Now let me see, what did they do with that corpse? Oh, the Police Station. - Come, Oscar. - Just a minute. - It'll keep till after lunch, won't it? - Well, I hope so. I never look at a corpse on an empty stomach. Come on. Well, I suppose you'll want me to make an autopsy. Soon as possible. Where'd that thing come from? I keep it in the closet. That body was here when I came in at one o'clock this morning. Someone must have stolen it. I meant to tell you, Hildegarde, one of the first things to remember about handling a murder case. Always keep in touch with your corpse. Did you lock the doors and the windows last night? - Did anyone else have the key? - No. I suppose this place is so healthy even the corpses don't lie still. Uh-huh, just as I thought. They used a sharp blade, or knife or something. So this is how they got the body out. Whoever it was didn't want you to perform an autopsy. I hope that's clear to you now, Doctor, now that you're fully dressed. Now the next thing to do is to find that body. - No! - Yeah! Oh... at it again, huh? - I'll report this to Chief Britt. - That'll be a great help. Look, Hildegarde, I think I've spotted something. Oh... Well, if you bend it a little, you'll get it through. What did you find, Oscar? A wheelbarrel track with a piece broken out of the wheel rim. Yeah, and it ends right up here at the cement. Well it's a cinch they couldn't get very far with that body without being seen. Oh, yes they could. There was a heavy fog last night. - Any footprints? - Not a one. No? Go easy, go easy! Oscar! Well I'll be. A nice clean heelmark with a K in it. Hmm. Have you got a list of the suspects? Which one of this bunch in your opinion is the most innocent looking? Now, Oscar, you're not going to tell me that you've been into those books again. - What books? - Those murder books. It's always the innocent-looking ones who are guilty and no one knows. No, this is a theory I worked out for myself. Hm. Which one of these is the most innocent-looking? Well, I suppose the honeymooners, the Devings. Okay, I'll give them the going-over first. Oscar, you're a wonderman. Just common sense, that's all. Common sense and inspiration. And a knowledge of human nature. - Anything else? - Well, that and... psychology. What, no genius? No, I don't see that it would take any genius to... Oh... will you please just mind your own business! I'll tackle this myself, this is a man's job. That's what I'm afraid of. You understand, don't you, Mr. Jones? Now run along and play. - Who is it? - Miss Withers. Come in. Oh, I'm sorry, I'll come back. That's all right, stick around a while. What's the matter, dear? Oh, I guess I was just feeling sorry for myself. Well, that's about the only pleasure we women have left. Anything in particular or just life in general? Well, I guess it was those newlyweds. Everytime I see newlyweds I balk. Oh, they won't always be like that, they'll settle down. It isn't them I'm thinking about, it's me. You know, I could have been like that once. Goofy and cockeyed with love. Well, can't you still be? What, a tramp like me? You're wrong, young lady, this isn't 1900. If I had your youth and looks. I'd pick out the nicest and nearest unattached man and marry him. - And then what? - Then I'd play fair with him. That's more than most men have any right to expect. I couldn't even get a tumble out of a decent guy now. Well, I don't know much about such things but... That Mr. Kelsey seems to be... what do you call it, tumbling? - He is nice, isn't he? - So are you. Oh yes, you are. Much to nice to be mixed up with a possible murderer just to get yourself a job. What do you mean? Well, you see, dear, I happened to overhear you talking with Mr. Tate... ...on the path this morning. Now, you know something about him... ...that you're willing to keep quiet if he'll get you a job. What is it? Well... You know, you've been pretty swell to me. I don't know why. And I suppose you're gonna find out anyway, so I'm going to tell you. It happened on the plane. You see, I saw... Alright, what did you do with the body? - What did you do with it? - We don't know anything about it. Oh, Marvie, what is he talking about? Listen here, you two! Well, Oscar! Alright, Hildegarde, come on in, come on... Close that door, will you! Here are your two innocent honeymooners. Body snatchers, the both of them. - Tell him we're not, Marvie. - We're not. Come along, come along here! - Here's your murderer, Inspector. - You haven't got anything on me. Shut up! What are you talking about? This guy Deving did it. And he stole the body. He's got heels marked with a K. And I saw tracks just outside the infirmary. That don't prove anything, I wear them myself. - You what? - Sure! So do most of the people on the island. They're good too. Made by the Kolt Shoe Hospital in Los Angeles. But here's the guy that did the murder in case you're interested. I caught him trying to make his escape in a rented motorboat. Oh, I've told you a dozen times... ...I was just going out a short ways to see if my schooner was coming. - Your what? - My schooner, she was to meet me here today. I told you I was planning a fishing expedition. Alright, I'll change your plans. Pretty thin story, Beegle. Schooner, bah! I doubt if he ever saw the deck of a schooner. - Come along! - Hey, you can't arrest me! Of course he can't arrest you. Don't arrest him, Britt, just lock him up. - Come along! - Oh, take your hands off me! I guess I owe you folks an apology... for the time being. - Come along here... - Excuse me, Mr. Chief. I just saw the harbor master passing by. Is the harbor master mixed up in this too? Yessir. He said to tell Cap'n Beegle his schooner's been sighted comin' 'cross. He be here 'most in a minute now. - Oh, thank you! - Yessir. - I guess I was wrong. - You bet you were! I told you I've been telling you the truth. Now I suppose I can go and meet my schooner. - Go ahead, get him out of here. - I'm awful sorry this happened, Captain. - That's all right, that's all right. - If you're really going swordfishing, I can show you where they run in swarms. Oscar! Well? Now if you that think you've arrested everybody that's available, I have a bit of information for you. Mr. Tate did not drink the same liquor that he offered Forrest. Thought you said it was out of the same flask. Tell him, dear? Yes, it was out of the same flask. But I saw him turn the flask around before he drank. It had two compartments. It did, eh? Where is this guy Tate, come on? - Inspector... - Well, what's on your mind? We're in a... Well, Mrs. Deving thinks we ought to discuss this with you but... we don't want to be drawn in on this murder thing. I'm not afraid myself but... Well, someone may take it out on Mrs. Deving if they find out we're giving information. All right, spill it. You'll have to promise to protect us. Sure, we'll protect you, come ahead. Well, Mrs. Deving was up about dawn this morning and... ..she happened to look out of the window. And then she woke me up. I saw it too. It... You tell them, honey. There was lots of fog and it was still pretty dark. We saw the two airplane pilots... ...take a body out of a side door of the hotel and put it in the car. It was all limp and covered with white. They drove off toward the airport. So that's where the body went. The pilots stole it. Got as far as the hotel in the fog and then lugged it over to the airport. Probably took it up in their plane and dumped it in the ocean. Alright, you three people can go, thanks very much. Give me the airport! Yeah! I'll have those guys over here and in a hurry too. Alright, I can stand it just as long as you two can. Aw, come on, once more. What did you do with Forrest's body after you smuggled it out of the hotel? Just a formality. Oh, you're crazy, we haven't seen that body since we dropped it off at the infirmary. What was that you brought to the airport this morning, your laundry? Alright, Britt, put some irons on them, maybe they'll remember better down in jail. Now wait a minute! Let's spill this. It's not worth the $25 to get mixed up in the mess. Alright, it wasn't the body that we took from the hotel. - It was Tate. - Tate? Well, I must say you boys have got imagination. Wait a minute, Oscar. If it was Mr. Tate, why did you have him covered up? He said he couldn't walk out of the hotel. He didn't want anyone to recognize him. Humph! Doesn't sound like the Mr. Tate I know. Well he said he got in a little mix-up last night and... he pretended to be drunk and we were to carry him out and... ...fly him down the isthmus where his company is working. What was the nature of this mix-up? I don't know, lady, but we didn't ask any questions. All we did was what we were paid to do. And you're trying to tell that to me. Go and ask Tate himself, he'll tell you. That's just what we're going to do. We'll all go down to the airport... ...and you'll fly us all down to the isthmus, come on. They're not there anymore. They moved in at noon to the bird farm. To the... Shoe hospitals and bird farms. Come on, you two. Hey, Tate, come here! What do you mean come here? I'm directing a picture. I'm directing this part of it. Piper's the name, New York Police. Come here. Did you hire these pilots to carry you out of the hotel... ...and fly you to the isthmus this morning? - What fantastic tale is this? - You double-crosser! This dick's accusing us of being body snatchers. Tell him it was your body we snatched or I'll box you ears off! Oh, come on now, cut it out, both of you. Hey, Britt, get these guys out of here. - Come on, boys. - Go on, get out of here. Well, Mr. Tate, did they or didn't they carry you out of the hotel? Well, I... I did think it advisable to have them... assist me. What was the mix-up you was in last night? That was only my excuse to the pilots. As a matter of fact I was so upset at being involved in this murder business... that I took a little more white wine last night than was... Well, shall we say, judicious. I see. What about your flask? - My flask? - You heard, the flask. Why do you got two compartments in it for? Why did you give Forrest the poisoned liquor... ...and pretend to drink the same liquor yourself? - It wasn't poisoned. - Let's see that flask. It's true that it has two bottles in it. The neck's crossed so that whichever way you drink from it... ...only one bottle pours out at a time. I use it because I have to give away so many drinks. I keep bonded stuff in one side for myself... ...and feed the other side with cheap bourbon for my friends. - That's the truth. - Yeah, why did you lie about it then? Why did you let Phyllis La Font blackmail you with it? Well, I... I was on the spot. I've got to get this picture finished. I was afraid of being arrested. I'll report to you every night. Well, alright. But I'll keep the flask. Thanks, you're welcome to. - Okay, Mr. Tate! - Yes, that will do nicely. Excuse me. All right, George! Let's go. Scene one forty. Let's get the lights on. Okay. - What lens you got on? - Two inch. Quiet, please! Now, just before we proceed. I want this shot to be magnificent. Keep it quiet, keep it quiet... And I want absolute silence. Somewhat of a critic. Hey, listen. This guy Tate did it alright. Give him enough rope and watch him hang himself. It begins to look as though the murderer would have to hang himself... ...if he ever expects to be hanged. I'm not so sure that Mr. Tate is the murderer, though. Oh, you're not so sure, oh, oh, oh, you're not so sure. This guy Tate just fascinates you because he's connected with the movies. You dames are all alike. Nobody in Hollywood can do any wrong. What a detective you'd make. I must admit I haven't made a very smart one out of you, Oscar. Listen, the only thing you'll ever make out of me is a raving lunatic. I'm gonna find out... if anybody up at that hotel saw this guy... ...take any drinks last night. Are you sure you drank out of the right compartment? Well, it's a fine time to be reminding me of it. Think you're funny, don't you? - Quiet, please. - What? Ah...! And you're sure you didn't see this guy Tate, huh? No, sir, I'm positive. And I was right here at the desk from midnight on. You didn't fall asleep at any time? - Not once. - Not once? Well, I may have dozed off for just a minute. Hm, I thought so. Look. Here, Mr. Jones, come on, come on. That La Font dame is at it again. First she blackmails Tate and now she's after Kelsey. - I imagine she has good reasons. - I'll bet she has. Whenever you see two suspects with their heads together, you can bet they're cooking up something. I'm gonna find out what. See you later. A guy named MacArthur is on the job. - Did Mr. Mack arrive on the noon boat? - Yes, do you know him? - No, no. - He's a very interesting man. And the swordfish and halibut are fresh too, er... - A specialty of the house. - Oh. - I'll take that envelope of mine. - You can leave it here safely, Mr. Mack. It's perfectly alright, the safe is burglarproof. Never mind the safe, I've changed my mind. Yes, sir. Oh! Dropped my purse. - Stupid. - Permit me. - Thank you. - Not at all, it's a pleasure. Thanks. He gave it to me just an hour ago, I wonder why he took it away. I'm inclined to wonder myself. Now you listen to me. If you think you're coming to my room, you're crazy. Things are hot enough now. There's nothing to be talked about and I don't want to be seen with you. You'll get it the way we planned it and like it! Now listen, it's P.O. box 275. The combination is right-4, left-9, right-seven, left three. Oh, I... I beg your pardon. You might have knocked. Having trouble? No, no, just practicing. - It's new to me. - Yes, pretty hard at first. Yes... yes. How'd you do, Miss Withers? Oh, hello... er... Come over here, I want to talk to you a minute. That's for something I want you to do for me. Now, if you do it right, I'll give you some more. - You see those mailboxes over there? - Yessum. I want you to stay here and watch mailbox 275. When someone comes to open it, see who it is. But don't let anyone know that you're watching it. Just pretend that you're waiting around for the next mail to arrive. Report to me as soon as you see who opens box 275. You mean you want me to be a detective dude like Mr. Piper? Ye... but not like Mr. Piper. 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28... Hello? Oscar? Well where have you been all day? I found you something of vital importance. So have I. I've got the wheelbarrow. It's hidden here in the basement of the cassino. And it's ten to one the body's around here somewheres too. Get down here as fast as you can. I'll meet you outside. Right away, right away! Oh, gee! Why, Mr. Jones, what are you doing here? Oscar! Oscar... Oscar... - Say! - Don't do that! Oh, alright, I'm sorry. Just saw Phyllis's dog. Oh, she's out wandering around at this time of night. And Tate pacing up and down the boardwalk, he didn't see me. He's up and about too, huh? Things are getting pretty hot for all of them. Something's gonna break wide open around here pretty soon. You think Forrest's body is in here somewhere? Certainly, and a swell place to hide it too. There's over a hundred rooms in there. Doors, corridors, it's a regular maze, passageways... Look! Someone's got a flashlight in there. Somebody else wants that body. Come on. - Oscar, don't... - Shh! Alright, stick'em up. What are you doing with me? Well, if it isn't Miss Withers. What are you doing here? Where? Here at the cassino, come on, quit stalling. Oh, am I still here? A fine bunch of pals to go away and leave me here alone. Someone go away and leave you here too? No. Well, don't worry, I'll leave you two alone. So long, folks. Is he always like that? He may be pretending to be drunk now. He heard us coming, he had time to hide the flashlight. If he's pretending to be drunk, he's had an alcohol rub. Come on, Hildegarde. Stop right where you are. What's the idea of coming up behind us like that? Well, people are not supposed to be in the building after the dance. It's my duty to see they're not. Oh, it is, eh? - Anybody else up here? - No, sir. Oh, so nobody else is up here, huh? I meant to tell you about that young couple, sir. They asked me if they could stay and watch the lights... ...and I told them they could, sir, for a little while. Oh, you did, eh? - Come on, Hildegarde. Hey, you out there, come in here! Alright, come here, come here. What are you two doing out here at this time of night? Well, we were just looking at the lights. The watchman said we could. Mrs. Deving thought that she... Well, you know, we're on our honeymoon. Alright, alright. Seen anybody else up here? Well, I... Well, come on, come on, make up your mind. Have you or have you not seen anybody? Well, there is something... Get down! Stay here, Hildegarde. Come on, you. Alright, get some light on. Hello, operator. Inspector Piper speaking. Get a hold of Chief Britt right away. Have him get over here with enough men to surround the cassino. Yeah. There's a murderer named Beegle running loose. Okay. Marvie! What's the matter? Did he come by here, did you see him? No, Oscar, but this boy has been killed. Oh, no! Marvie! He's dead... Let me go! You did this! This is your fault! You promised you'd protect him. He told you about the airplane pilots and now he's dead! Now, now, now, take it easy. Well, why don't you do something, Oscar? I've done it, Britt's on his way over here. Beegle pulled this job. He wasn't drunk tonight, he sneaked up the ramp after us. I'll get him if it's the last thing I do! I loved him! He was the only thing I had in the world. Oh, why did you let them do this to me? You killed him! Here you are, Inspector. Good work, Britt. Couldn't have done it faster myself. I can't take much credit. When the call came, my friend Capt. Beegle here was having a sandwich with me. So we just jumped a car with the rest of the men and came on over together. - How long has he been with you? - About twenty minutes. Nice work, Oscar. Oh, Marvie... You men help me with this girl. You've got to get her to the hotel. - She's in a serious condition. - Get her in a car. And send somebody up for that body. I'm going to search this place from ceiling to cellar. Yeah, humph! Come on! Come in. - Oh, Oscar! - Hello, Hildegarde. No luck, no murderer, no body. A freshly-dug grave is what we must find. And there's at least one person on this island who knows where that grave is. Either murder will solve the other, Oscar. That's what I think. How's the little girl this morning? The doctor reports a complete breakdown. He gave her a sedative, she's sleeping. I'm gonna make one of those mugs talk if I have to work on them with a rubber hose. A very original idea for a policeman. You might begin using it on Mr. Mack. Listen, Hildegarde, we've got six perfectly good suspects on out necks... ...without dragging in a guy that wasn't even in the island when Forrest was killed. When he did come, he brought $10,000 in cash. So I am to go around arresting everybody with 10,000 in cash. Well, you wouldn't have to arrest many people these days. How do you know he's got the ten grand? I took it out of his postbox. - You took it? - I've got it. Here it is. Well that's fine! Robbing the mails. I have enough on my mind without having to get you out of a federal jail. You'll get somebody into jail first, Oscar. I'll keep myself out. Too bad you weren't smart enough to let me watch that box. And arrest whoever opened it. So you could use a rubber hose on him and get nowhere? With my system, he'll give himself away when he finds the money gone. - I am having the postbox watched. - So that's your system. Can you suggest a better one? I suggest using your head a little. That would be nice work for you, Oscar, if you could get it. Oh... Oh, drawing pictures, huh? Whiling away the time between murders. Oh, I just made that sketch without thinking. It's that tree out there. Without looking too, I guess. What do you mean? Well, it's drawn backwards, that's all. You got it facing toward the ocean, look at that tree! I suppose it got restless during the night and turned over. Oscar! Someone's moved that tree. You can't beat a woman down! Of course she couldn't have drawn it wrong, no! No, someone moved it. They not only moved it but they dug a grave under it. He did it at night and put the tree in backwards. - Come on, Oscar. - Can you beat it? Look, Inspector! You're right, Hildegarde, it's a body. Yes, it's Forrest's. Alright, get a couple of men up here and have the body taken down to the infirmary. Now we'll prove some things. Inspector Piper wants a complete autopsy, Doctor. No slip-ups this time. You must find out how that man died. I intend to! Oh, Hildegarde. Well, the guards are all posted. There'll be no more flies in the ointment now. I got a little airmail communication from headquarters in New York. This'll prove very... - I've got to see him, it's very important. - Okay, Mike, let them in. Inspector, Miss La Font tells me you've found Forrest. Yeah. Well, as a friend of his, may I take charge of the body? - Sure, it's alright. - Oscar, what about the autopsy? Oh, we don't need no autopsy. It's a very good idea. Thanks very much, it'll help. You're under arrest. - Tommy! - You're crazy, what for? You would like to get hold of that body, wouldn't you? I thought so. You're under arrest for body-snatching. And for two murders, Mr. Forrest! - Forrest? - It isn't true, he would have told me. No? Here's his picture from New York, I was just gonna show it to you. Forrest, the only guy that can spill the beans on the Graber mob. And that means that the dead man in there is Kelsey. Come on, Forrest! You assumed his name, persuaded him to use yours and then killed him, didn't you? I did not! You expected Graber thinking you dead would lay off the hunting and let you escape. And you stole Kelsey's body to cover up how you killed him. No, no, he couldn't do that. Now wait a minute, Phyllis, he's partly right about me. I am Forrest. All that you said is true, Piper. With one exception, I didn't kill Kelsey. Of course not. Maybe you'll tell us who did. I don't know. But someone in the Graber mob hired to kill me. And why did he kill Kelsey instead? He thought Kelsey was me. We switched names before we got to Los Angeles. Kelsey was my bodyguard. He took my name so he'd be the one to run into any trouble. Evidently one of the Graber mob shadowed him to the hotel... ...and learned he had a plane reservation. - Then why did you steal his body? - To save my own life. I knew I was safe as long as the switch of names wasn't discovered. The fact that he killed Kelsey proved that he didn't know me by sight. - He thought his job was finished. - You've got all the answers, haven't you? - I'm telling you the truth! - And I don't believe it! Wait a minute, Oscar, why would he kill Deving? Because the kid found out who he was. - You're a little hasty, young man. - Hasty nothing! He's the killer. What do you want me to do, hand him a key to the city? He's going to jail! Come on! You can't arrest him, you can't do that! Yeah, and I think you're in this as deep as he is. I got a hunch you two planned this together. You always did have a vivid imagination, Oscar. I didn't do it, Piper, but if you must lock me up, leave Phyllis out of it, she had nothing to do with it. I never saw or heard of her before I came to Catalina. Alright. Is that all you got to say? No, there's something else. Please don't let it out that I'm Forrest. If the man that got Kelsey finds out I'm still alive, he'll go the limit to kill me. I'd grant his request, Oscar. Okay, get him out of here, Mike. Tommy... Tommy, wait a minute... - He's the murderer! - No, Oscar! Why, it's as plain as the nose on your face. The girl was left alone in the plane with the body. She killed Kelsey. And then tried to throw us off the scent with that story about Tate's flask. The guy's a partner. They planned to meet here at the island and make a getaway together. - Miss Withers, Miss Withers! - Yes, what is it? Excuse me. You know that post office box? Yes, did you see who opened it? Yessum, I sure did. Them two airplane gentlemen. Mr. Madden and Mr. French. They got a great big envelope out of it. And they acted awful queer about it too. Ah-ha, that changes things. - Oh, you've got some new theories? - You bet your life I have. And I've got to admit, Hildegarde, that you're okay. It was Kelsey's body that Madden and French carted out of the hotel that night. And they helped Forrest bury it. And then tried to fake up that story about Tate's drunkenness. I told you he was still mixed up in it. - Where are you going? - I'm gonna round up Tate and those pilots. That was good work, Willie, I'm proud of you. Here. Oh, it was just as easy as pie, Miss Withers. I just leaned my back against the wall and put my ol' eyes on 257. And I just watched it, and watched it... What number? - 257 like you told me. - I told you 275. Oh. 257... 72... The numbers seem the same to me, Miss Withers. Don't ever mention this to Mr. Piper. Oh, you little imp of Satan! You vandal! You four-legged vandal, I'll kill you! His name is Mr. Jones. I'm sorry, I didn't know he was a friend of yours. Will you warn your Mr. Jones if he kills any more... ...of our expensive imported fish, that I'll scalp him? Mr. Jones killed a fish? Impossible. There's your proof, Madam. And I saw your Mr. Watchamacallit standing right here. What did he do, shoot them? You'll notice he isn't wet. It's true. Well, then how is it, how could it... That's what I intend to find out. Dead fish? Well, I should think so. And it fits perfectly. - What is it? - A cigarette paper. And I think if we look closely, we'll find a package of cigarettes somewhere. Rialto Club cigarettes. Eureka! The cigarettes! And before they were destroyed too. Look! Are you going to tell me that cigarettes could kill those fish? If I'm not mistaken, these particular cigarettes could kill anything. If there's any justice in the world, you should have a kennel and a tree in the heart of Scotland Yard. - Oh, I'm so sorry. - Quite all right, quite all right. Come on in. Come on. Come on. - This is outrageous. - You make me ashamed of myself. What were you doing in my room? I'm more or less interested in discovering the murderer of Roswell Forrest. - What's that got to do with me? - It's got a lot to do with you, Mr. Mack. What about that envelope? What envelope? The one you put in the post box with $10,000 and a message. Oh... you know about that, eh? Yes. All right. In that case we'd better look up the chief of police. - I'll talk. - I thought you would. You're mistaken, you horse-faced old hen! I've been aching to plaster this on your puss! I ought to take the butt end of this gun... ...and pull those long ears of yours down around your neck. But I'm too tender-hearted. You'll kick, will you? Oh, you will kick, eh? You ought to wear adhesive tape all the time. You look better. Are you alright? Yes. What time is it? Half-past seven. I've been looking for you all afternoon. Second time I come back here I find you in the closet... ...all tressed up like King Tut's mammy. - The word is "mummy". - Alright, alright! What happened here? Who did it? Mack. He held me up in here. You've got to get him. - I'll get him alright. - If you can find him. - I'll find him! - I'm going with you. You're gonna stay right here out of danger. - I said I'm going with you! - I said your gonna stay right here! Hildegarde, will you listen? - See if he's taken his grips. - What a woman! What a man! Turn on the lights. Give me the jail. Forrest must have made his getaway. Hello, Inspector Piper speaking. How did that guy Forrest make his escape? Still there? Been there all the time? What? No. Better send somebody up here. You were right, Hildegarde, it wasn't Forrest. I should have gone after this guy before. Probably realized you had the goods on him, couldn't get off the island so he committed suicide. He didn't commit suicide. That isn't his gun. He held me up with an automatic and I found this extra magazine among his things. Automatic holster alright. And empty. That means that the murderer has Mack's gun. Certainly. For his own use. And he's carrying Mack's gun right now. Then that means he don't know that Mack held you up with it. That you can identify him. Precisely. That clears the whole mystery. Except for one missing link. What are you talking about? All we've got to go on is a gun. This proves that Mack was the center of the whole thing. He brought the $10,000 here to pay off the murderer. When the murderer found the phony envelope, he thought that Mack had double-crossed him. They quarrelled... - ...and Mack was killed. - And to think it's as simple as all that. Suppose you tell us why Deving was killed. That's the one missing link. It's the only thing I can't understand. The dizziest theory I ever heard in my life. I don't know. She may be right at that. - She's right about Kelsey's death. - What do you mean? The doctor says he had enough poison in his stomach to kill a horse. And says it didn't come from Tate's liquor. There wasn't a trace of it in the flask. It wasn't in the flask? - Did you know that? - Certainly! What's that got to do with this? Everything! I wonder if Mrs. Deving is strong enough to talk to us. She ought to be pretty well calmed down by now. Been in bed all this time. If she can remember one thing that happened in that plane, the whole mystery is solved. Come on, Oscar. Wait a minute. Take care of that body, Britt. - Feeling better now? - A little, thank you. Strong enough to talk to us? I want to help Marvie if I can. I know. I know, you just take your own time. Oh, excuse me. - Have a cigarette. - Thank you. - Hey... - Come, Oscar! Don't sit there with your face hanging out, give me a match. I know, but since when... I found these cigarettes. I found them in the queerest place. In the fish fountain downstairs, as though someone had thrown them away. Why did you change your mind about wanting those cigarettes, Mrs. Deving? Why... my throat, I just... I'll tell you why. Because you know those cigarettes are poisoned. They're the same cigarettes you slipped into that man's pocket... ...on the plane when you fell against him. Poisoned! Poisoned by Deving and you! You killed him! There's your murderer, Oscar! That's what you think. If you want more proof, you'll find Mack's gun in this room somewhere. That'll cinch it! If it's here, I'll find it! Stick'em up! Get back against that wall. Get back you! Look! Mack's gun, the automatic! Yes, it's Mack's gun, and I'll plug you both just like I plugged him. Don't think I'd miss! I got Mack for killing Marvie and double-crossing us... ...and I can do just as good a job to save myself. I'm in this so deep, I might as well go all the way. A couple more on my head won't make much difference now. Put down that gun, you can't get away with this. Get back, you! Get back! There are just two people in the world who even suspect the truth about me. And you're both right here. What good would it do you to kill us? Mr. Britt's right down the hall, he'd get you before you could leave this room. Oh, would he? He's going to hear three shots. He's gonna come running in here... ...and find me just conscious enough to tell him that the murderer is still at large. The guy I couldn't recognize who put a bullet through my shoulder... ...and murdered you both where you stood. That's my story. And you're stuck with it. And now, you first. Because you're a cop. You're not gonna make me burn for this. Let go! Let go! - Hildegarde, are you hurt? - No, certainly not! Didn't come anywhere near me. Oh, she didn't, huh? Oh, Oscar! She didn't come anywheres near you, oh, oh, oh... What's going on? What happened? What's the idea? Oh, nothing, only this dame here just tried to add me and Hildegarde to her list. Give me a hand. What list? I'll paint a picture of it for you. Deving and this dame killed that guy in the plane with poisoned cigarettes. She wasn't hurt when she smoked that cigarette in your office that time... ...because she'd switched packages again. And me sitting right there. I never would have thought it. So when they didn't get their money on time, Deving figured that Graber's payoff man was trying to double-cross them. - Payoff man? - Yeah, that was Mack. Deving tried to force Mack to come across. And Mack had to knock him off to save himself. And she shot Mack to revenge Deving. Pretty smart work on your part, Inspector. Oh, that was nothing. We had it figured out for some time. Mr. Britt, would you mind getting us an aspirin? Where's that guy Forrest? What do you mean by bailing him out? I was trying to help Phyllis, they're going to be married. I don't care if they're gonna have twins, I've got to take him back to New York with me. Where is he? Out there. - You mean in that boat? - Yes, that's Capt. Beegle's. He's taking them to Mexico. I arranged it. You made arrangements, are you crazy? - I'm going after him. - Wait a minute. Now wait a minute, Oscar. I had Forrest make out a sworn statement of his testimony for you. - Well, what... - He'll be safe now. He said you'd find all the other proof you need to convict Graber... ...in deposit box 223 at the Gordon Bank and Trust Company in New York. And, um... Here's the money too. You have your case against Graber. You don't need Forrest. W... well... Well, alright. Oh! Somebody left this at the desk for you. Oh, thanks. Oscar. Mr. Jones is in the closet. Who? Mr. Jones, Phyllis's dog. Ohhh! Mr. Jones, huh? Well, if that's Mr. Jones, where's Mrs. Jones? That's not in your department, Oscar. This is a case for the Court of Domestic Relations. - Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes
