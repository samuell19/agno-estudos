Isley might even agreed to admit it to them this farce has gone on long enough lieutenant you know damn well the inner court going to accept the personality test unless of course they throw out the doctor-patient relationship and then let everybody just testify against her cell counsel for the defense is right thank you for coming down dr. Isley I hope we have an intravenous do too much not at all there's any way i can i really would like to help thank you I take it the fingerprint analysis was inconclusive both their fingerprints were found in brought this apartment but the knife fan who was smudged iowa state doesn't have a case you're not gonna let them walk out of here the issue of reasonable doubt will continually undermine the case gentlemen 33 years I've been a cop I've ever see such a thing no one should be able to beat the system I like a professional trainer in books I especially oh I can't do that somebody could beat a better ride I'd say what you do I'll take a couple of weeks off I'll tell Stan are you working on special assignment see what you can dig up give me something concrete something I can use in court prosecute them to hell and back Oh you my keys anywhere thank you don't think you should go out me I'll go crazy if I have to sit around here it's a murder investigation Tracy and I don't pick the police that can give up so easily when you turn down that music I'll go crazy but they haven't got a case nothing you hope so you'd better hope so oh let's mess wouldn't have happened if it weren't

standing there myself see a plan tonight with my own eyes I still could make a thick unless unless I grabbed it by the wrist and held down to it until I hydron solitaire I don't know I thought by now you have an angle so I could do something anything like what I don't know i don't i don't know what what have you did give my series of personality tests but not anyone can commit murder my name is science fuck good turn up something that would hold up in court yeah suddenly would tell you categorically if when I'm is a killer that's it I don't think now besides identical twins are usually only of interest of science that they were raised apart nature versus nurture heredity versus environment that kind of thing you know it's funny you should mention that yes I brought you a little research that I did in my own those trials were orphaned at two months adapted to different families raised an entirely different environments Tracy she had her up the talented the God the lost his job and took the drinks the mother had some sort of a nervous mental break out and Tracy's out the house for good which was 15 years old a li li different upbringing all together nice caring family good rage at the state university by shiva spent the summer in europe and then she found out about the sister and it became an obsession to find her which she did now I don't know you're gonna say I'm crazy but

to say no and they're important didn't came up to meet all of his friends he invited me well I got so excited I I think I made myself sick so instead of turning him down I said Tracy instead um did he notice a difference yes at first he just thought I was Moody and then she began to drink oh she's not used to drinking so she made a complete fool of herself she was dancing on the piano home grabbing husbands and pharrell yanked her out of the party and took a back to his place he's bad Tracy just thought it was funny she apologized and then tried to calm him down he didn't care I said he was over and he never wanted to see her again he said it just like that not any feeling and he sat down the piano started to play Tracy decided to punish him she did the knife and stabbed him with it and she left him to die please he told you all about this that's right she was uh disturbed that way dr.
