IN ASSOCIATION WITH INSPRIRED BY A TRUE EVENT. THE SPIRITUAL STORYLINE IN THE MOVIE REFLECTS THE FILMMAKERS' OWN IMAGINATION YEAH1CMG and GALAXY M&E present [April 1999] I know, shut up! Just aim it right! That's the mute girl, shoot her! The mute girl can't talk! Boat! There's the boat! Follow him. Get out of my way! He has a crow. That's rad! Anyone wants to feed her? Hey Sap, where you going? - Sap! - Sap! Oh man! Is the crow for a circus, Mister? No, boss. I'm a shaman. Do you know what that is? Of course! A shaman is a healer. Just like Old Ba, Co Tu's mother! - Yeah. - Good! Is it alright if I park my boat here for a few days? How should I know? You need to ask Uncle Sang. Uncle Sang? Yes, he's the land owner. Hey. Can you take me to Uncle Sang? Sure. Follow me! What's your name? My name is Huynh. She is mute, just ignore her. Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! What happened, father? I have no idea. What are they up to? This land once belonged to the Champa. Be careful, Bap! I've got it. Why did you stop? What? B... B... Bo... Bone. Blissful… Hurry up! Jade! This is yours. I found it, it's mine. This is yours. You crazy? Give me that! - Give me. - It's mine! Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! Mr. Shaman! Come to Co Tu's house quick! Yen is possessed and unconscious. Come quick, Mr. Shaman! Bullshit! If ghost were real, we would have been possessed long time ago, right Tam? Tam… Tam... Tam…Tam…Tam... You're scared of ghost too? Why the hell not? Then why you still run your mouth? Eat this! She has been acting silly since she had miscarriage. She just said she saw a ghost then fainted. What are you spraying? Lavender and willow bark, all natural anesthesia. Why...? Mom! Before I begin, I must warn you that I must not be interrupted until I am done. Or it will harm Yen. Do you understand? Do you understand? Yes, we do, Master. Now I will need someone to assist me. Can I, Master? But he's retarded, he didn't know anything. Soi, come and assist me. Hah, not that crazy girl... First the retard, then the deaf mute. Don't worry. Come here and assist me. Don't let her sit up or look down, understand? Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya.♪ (♪Sanskrit: Keep me not in Unreality, but make me go toward Reality.) Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Stop this now! This magic is evil! No mother. Don't risk Yen's life! Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya. Oh my god! Look what's coming out. What are those? Yen? How are you feeling now? I'm fine. Master Huynh is the best! Thank you, Master. Master Huynh, I heard you wanted to open a clinic. I want to talk to you about that. Thank you. - What? - I can't sell this! No use for silver. Let me see your hand. Let's sell this bracelet. Never! This is my lucky bracelet. It's not for sale! We all found this together. But I saw it first, so it's mine! - Give me that! - Never. Ouch! What are you doing? - What the... - Whose crap is this? Girl, just focus on doing your job. Wow! Officer Ky! What brings you here so early? I heard we had a newcomer in town, Mr. Huynh? Yes, but what for? Don't tell me that he's a wanted criminal? Who told you that? Don't tell me he has something to do with the recent robberies in town. That's rad! He's mining gold for Sang. I know Granny, I was just kidding. But seriously, if I were Sang, I'd open a clinic for Huynh, get rich faster that way. No way Sang's land has gold in it. You're all idiots if you believe that Huynh is a healer. Better than you! Your magic couldn't heal Yen. May be you should take Yen to Huynh, he would make her... - Tam! - Pregnant again... Shut up! Healer or miner is all fine, please tell him to bring his ID to register at the station. Okay, I got it. I'll tell him when I see him. Drive safe, officer! To practice Kumanthong requires the rage of a woman who has just been killed. Soi is deaf, mute and dumb as well. Thanks to you she has a job now. Soi! Starting today you will work for Master Huynh. This girl... Please tell Soi to buy me groceries. Soi. What's that awful thing in your hair? Remember to pick up these items for me. And listen to Master Huynh. [MORNING GLORY, PORK, CHICKEN FEET, BALUT, LEMON AND CHILLI] When training to become a shaman, first, you need to learn how to distinguish one herb from another. Castor. The seeds are crushed to make healing oil for curing many illnesses. Datura. Grind the seeds into powder and it's a powerful anaesthetic. But it will likely cause epilepsy in children. Second, you need to distinguish one illness from another. Herbs and seeds make great medicine to heal a sickness of the body. For the sickness of the soul, the only way is to have some belief. This old shack would be good as new after some renovations. Thank you! Now that you and Master have a new house, when is the wedding? We haven't even held hands, yet. Maybe you're giving him the wrong signals. Too sour! I don't know what the right signals are. If you don't know the right way, then I'll show you. Men are simple, you have to feed love to feel love. Did you make this for me? Why did you choose to tattoo this? It reminds me of my mom. When I was eight... I saw a snake about to bite my mother. - I hugged my mom so it would bite me instead. - Mom... I began shaking, and then I died. Everyone thought I was dead... They buried me. Mama! Help me! But Kumanthong has chosen me to be Master's successor. Mama! After I was saved by Master, I returned home and saw my mom had hang herself out of sadness. If I master Kumanthong, I can meet her soul. Be a good boy. Give me your hand! Do you want to die? Master started to increase the amount of venom I injected so I could be immune with it. And get closer to my mom. What if you die? I won't die. After I inject the venom, if I start shaking, then I need you to stick the needle... into my thigh. I am fine. Please wait a moment! You've been experiencing headaches and faint spells, haven't you, Sao? Someone has put a hex on you. That's cause you're too pretty, the other girls must have been jealous. - I'll need to tattoo a protection spell for her. - Yes. - But this ceremony is not for outsiders. - Okay. Sorry Sang, but you'll have to wait outside. You'll need to change, otherwise your shirt will be inked. Soi, help Sao change while I make some tea. This will help to numb your skin. Please serve our guest some tea. No charge. You're Sang's friend. How can you make a living without charging? I'll come back and pay you another day then. I can make a love charm for you. It will put anyone you choose under your spell. As long as you're willing to endure a challenging ceremony. I'm sure it's worth the trouble. Come back at the end of the month, follow these instructions exactly as I've noted. Thank you, and goodbye, Master. Hey! Put that down! I've got proof that you've been stealing dirt from me, now! This time plus another time is only twice, no biggie! Don't let me catch you, punk! I'll get one more bag please! There are two of you? Can you help me look out for those two land robbers? They're always sneaking around late at night. Let's go, Sao. Don't do that. Wait! Don't open that! Why not? I brought it as a gift for us to celebrate. But that's XO. It's too expensive to drink! We can kill this instead. Soi, come here and have a drink! I'm sorry Master. She's never had a boyfriend, let alone a marriage proposal! - Would you mind if I take a look inside the box? - Not at all. It's a wedding gift for you. I hope Soi will accept. Of course she will. Who would she marry around here other than you? Cheers! Soi may be just another deaf-mute to most of you. But to me, Soi is very special. Congrats! Soi has helped me cure Yen and Sap. I have no doubt that some day she will save your lives as well. To my lovely wife, Thuy Ngan! I know you expected a big wedding. But at least your groom is handsome. Be honest. Are you getting married so soon because you're pregnant? The wedding is so sudden. Have you two done that? Why aren't you sure? So... Did you bleed? It felt like a cut. Like a cut? That's terrible! I thought it would hurt just a little bit. Have you done it? No! I don't even like boys! I just want to go to Saigon. Get out? Are you leaving me? No cousin, I would never leave you. But sometimes I sell lottery tickets to some people who are going to Saigon, I wonder what would happen if I just stayed on the bus. You know what always makes me get off that bus? It's you. Who will take care of my big sister if I leave? The ceremony must be held on the full moon... when the spiritual energy of Kumanthong is the strongest. Hong! Where are you? Where is my wife? How strange is he! Stilt houses have the underfloor for ventilation. Why does he have to cover all up? - He's not as weird as us. - Why? He's not as weird as us stalking him all day. Yeah right. The sacrifice must be offered in the cellar to make sure the body will be clean. When you succeed, the soul can not escape and will become your slave forever. A patient is coming. Go light the candles in the tunnel. Come on up! Good. Let's change for you and we'll proceed. Soi, help our guest change, then wait outside until I finish helping her. Soi! Soi! Soi! Soi! Calm down and listen to me! Soi! Calm down and listen to me! Soi! I'm sorry. You need to calm down and listen to me. No, I didn't kill her. Soi! Listen to me! She tried to kill me! Didn't you see the knife on the floor? She came here to rob and kill us! You have to believe me. I know what it looked like. She was naked because I was treating her for a woman's illness. But she took out her knife and tried to kill me, and rob us. You have to believe me. We have to tell the police. We... Soi! Calm down! We can't tell the police. Do you think they're going to believe me when they see her? Even you, my own wife, you didn't believe me! I can tell them it's not your fault. Soi! It doesn't matter, they will still send me to jail. Or even executed! I'll lose my job. We'll lose our home, everything we've built. Your name, your father's name... We will be considered murderers for lifetime. Just because that woman tried to rob us? She's the one that deserves to be punished, not us! You must believe me! Soi! You're my wife. You must believe me. Have you met this woman? No, we haven't. That's strange. Because Tam said that he saw Sang bringing her to your clinic about a month ago. Well.. I've seen so many patients this month, I can't remember their faces. Can you ask if she remembers seeing this woman? He wants to know if you've seen this woman. We'll lose our home, everything we've built. Your name, your father's name... We will be considered murderers for lifetime. - Can you translate what I say to her? - Yes. This woman is dangerous. She has robbed many people at knife point. So you must report if you see her. I told you. Hey! A Mui offered me $50 for this necklace, but I didn't take it. However, I'll let it go for $40 because you're buying it for Yen. It's too expensive! I'm happy that you came all the way from Can Tho for my birthday. Of course a present is better, what are you saying? Yen was right. We're neighbors, don't be so greedy. - $20 is fair. - What... Your offered price is dropping like my blood pressure. Since we're neighbors, I'll reduce $2. It's $38. $30. $37 and you have a deal. This guy, bargaining for chump change. $32! Last price or nothing! $36, deal? - Take this and pay him $30. - What... Good afternoon, Master. I thought you're a vegetarian. Why did you buy pig head? I'm making an offering. May I borrow your biggest pot to boil this? - Of course, it's in the back. - Thank you. - Nam, go help Master Huynh. - Ok. - Hey, Nam! - Yes? You should ask Master Huynh to heal Yen, he's good. Okay. A Mui! I'm glad that you're back to make the talisman. Actually, that's not the only reason why I came back. I saw them today… My lousy ex-husband and that tramp. They were sitting on their porch... where anyone who passed by could see them. He was rubbing coconut oil on her swollen belly. I will give you more. You can go to hell with your pennies. Honey! Honey! As if publicly mocking me with her baby. The potion you gave me the other day... - Can you just stop? - What? I told you I would give you more. I told you. I'm 8-month pregnant. I can't take care of my baby with your little money. Hang on. I'll go get the doctor. If you want more power, I'll show you Kumanthong. She's like a child, isn't she? Get inside and straighten the altar. Let's go. That's rad! What rad? Girl. - Does she really wear that dress to a clinic? - Yeah... No wonder she's sick all the time. Look at that ass. Will the fertility treatment be as public as last time? Not at all. Will be just you and me. Soi, eat this. Enough, or you wouldn't be able to fight. Why are you running? Ghost chasing you? Soi? Are you crazy? Come out and tell me what's going on. Come out. Soi. What happened, Soi? Come out and tell me. It's nothing, dad. I know exactly what to do whenever she gets like this. What's wrong with her? Soi, please tell me what happened? Just the typical husband and wife problem. What happened to her? It's nothing, dad. Thank you, dad. What did you tell your father? Before you decide to run again, or even think about telling anyone about what you saw, I want you to remember. The reason that I am able to make talisman and perform spiritual healing… Is because I practice Kumanthong. If you ever betray me, then it's your head... your father's head... will be in this basket. You know that I have the power to do this. Right? Understood? Understood? Good girl! Good girl! I want to ask you something. Do you know her? I heard that you met her right before she went missing. - Sao? - Yes. She showed me the talisman tattoo Master Huynh did for her. I find it very strange. Since he drifted into this town, the villagers are riled up with his hocus-pocus. Then suddenly a few girls went missing. Are you boiling the pig head for the ceremony? Go on inside and light an incense. I'll be inside in a minute! Okay. Light the fire. Stay here and keep the pot from boiling over. Damn, that's a big pot! It's feast time! You glutton! Smell good! - Delicious! Put it in, Bap! - Alrighty. Hey, don't close the lid! The meat would fall down to the bottom. Scoop out the foam! We can't eat with foam like that. Look at her scowl face, as if we want to eat her plate. You stupid! She's deaf-mute, how could she understand you? I forgot. Soi, what we meant is... This… e… a… eat. Delicious! Plus, we have... Duck eggs and corns. To contribute... Contribute into this pot. And one, two, three, four of us… e… a... eat. Delicious! The head won't be ready tonight, my friends! Tell Nam not to worry. Two more treatments and you will be pregnant. Thank you, Master. Tomorrow, I will bring my famous "gio thu" to the cafe for you! Want us to scoot. - It's only pork, not human meat delicacies. - Yes. Contribute. Save me some, okay? Let's go buy some beef, I'm fed up with pork. You're vegetarian but you can cook normal dishes. Marvelous! The ceremony must be held on the full moon... when the spiritual energy of Kumanthong is the strongest. Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya We offer blood of the innocents. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya The soul will leave Kumanthong in white smoke. You must inhale deeply and take the soul into your own body. It will become your slave forever. Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Only when you succeed can you bring back your mom's soul. Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya You seem sad today, Master. I have a present for you. Please open it. Soi! Why are you sitting in there? My husband is inside with a patient. I'm not allowed to disturb. Hey, come out here with me. Come out so we can eat and talk. Come on. The tramp got what she deserved don't you think? Yes. Now… You don't feel like a loser anymore. Right? Yes. If you ever want to feel... much more powerful... Do you want to learn Kumanthong? Your face is thinner. My face is thinner? You want me to take care of my health? I'm doing just fine. It's because of you. Who ran home and scared the crap out of me! Is it good between you and Huynh? I know it's none of my business, but… You can always come home if things ever get bad again. I'll take care of you. Is there something you want to tell me? Anything at all? Just the normal problems. Just the normal problems like any other married couples? If you want to learn more about Kumanthong, follow these instructions when you come back. There's someone outside. Motherfucker! Damn it! Dug a whole tunnel, didn't bother to put a light in it. So wet! Fuck! Ghost! Ghost! There's a ghost! The same exact thing happened to Phong Fishy in Coconut Canal. He said he was walking home late night when he saw a beautiful girl. She asked him to walk her home, so he did. She gave him water when he was thirsty and sticky rice was he was hungry. Three days later they found him with cow shit in his mouth. Looking just like Tam. I told you that land is very sacred! You robbed the graves of the dead, and this is how they get you back! You didn't listen to me! Tam! Tam! Tam! Are you okay? Look! He's still seeing ghosts! Jesus. Say a word and I'll kill you. If you want to learn more about Kumanthong, follow these instructions... when you come back. Since he drifted into this town, the villagers are riled up with his hocus-pocus. Then suddenly a few girls went missing. You'll need to change before we begin. Cat, come on up. Don't be scared. This is Cat. She wants to learn Kumanthong from you. Yes, Master. A Mui said I can repay you by doing the cooking and cleaning. Please teach me, Master. Let's do what Master says and get you out of your dirty clothes. Come closer and look into her eyes. You can actually see her life dimming like a flame. Undress her! Have you calmed down? Why do you shave her there? To cleanse her, purify her body. Girls like her who sell their bodies bring nothing but sin to this life. At least Kumanthong will bring meaning to her death. Three days from now, I will perform the ceremony with her skull. We make the blood offering to summon the soul. I'll say the chant to force her soul to become visible. Thus, master Kumanthong. Why do you practice Kumanthong? To make her soul become my slave forever. Everyone get on, let's go! Datura. Grind the seeds into powder and it's a powerful anaesthetic. But it will likely cause epilepsy in children. Sap! Sap! Keep fighting. Don't leave me. Thank you Master for helping my child. Yen! Yen! What are you doing here? - Please let me see Master Huynh. - Do you have an appointment? Master, I need to see you. I have a very urgent matter. Master is tired. Let him take a rest. Let him take a rest. Please Master, let me in. It's really urgent. I need to see you, Master! Please open the door. I need to see you. Yen! Yen is waiting outside. Should I let her in? But it's an urgent matter, I need to see Master. Please! I need an abortion. Abortion? Last time Nam came back to visit, he was so busy drinking that we didn't have time to do anything. Now that I'm pregnant. He will say that this is a demon child. Or worse, he will think that I was unfaithful to him. I've never been with anyone else but my husband. Master, I could never bring shame to him like that. Please ask the gods to let me return this child to them, Master. I'm sorry, I can't do that. What Master meant is that he cannot help you now. Your child is a gift from heaven. If you want to return it, you need to come back late tonight to perform a special ceremony. Don't you worry, Master will help you. Remember to follow these instructions exactly. Or else the spirits will deny your wish. Thank you. I warn you, do not overstep your boundary! Calm down Master. Everything I've done has been to serve you. Yen has agreed, so tonight we must kill her, before we leave. Why do I have to leave? Ky is growing suspicious on you. It's only a matter of time before he comes to search this house. The police! Killing Yen! These troubles are all from you! Yen's trouble is what you brought. Ky and those missing girls... Whose fault is that? You have given me purpose of my life. I even sacrifice my life to protect you. But I am not the one you need to kill. Don't you see? Kumanthong chose me to help you. I have money. We can be anywhere to continue your work of god. Take Soi with us. We'll need help to carry luggages and offerings. We will perform the ceremony tonight and leave right after. I don't understand. - Do you see Ky anywhere, Vien? - No. - Where do you want to go? - Saigon. $1. You want to register residency? - Vien, find me the residency log. - Okay. Ky is not here, I will let you know when he comes back. Hey miss! Hello? Yes. Ok. Let's go. Soi? Soi? Let's go! Soi! Have you seen Soi anywhere? What's wrong? Something happened to her? Looking for your husband? He left already. Did you pack, Master? I only bring the altar and the chest. We'll bring them to the boat after the ceremony. Have you brought all of your belongings? I brought only a few things. About the money, I've asked Aunt Hai to bring to us at the ferry. Since we still need to perform the ceremony tonight, it should be someone that no one will miss. Light the lamps in the tunnel! Gui, come on up. Soi's up here. Soi! Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya Mrtyor-Maa Amrtam Gamaya Asato Maa Sad-Gamaya This is your fault, you killed her! If she hadn't seen you at the police station... Never touch her again! Cut her off outside! Help! Help me! Help! Help! Help! Only when you succeed can you bring back your mom's soul. Mother. Mother, you've come home. You've come home! You've come home! You've come home! You've come home. If I die, please let my mother know where to find me. You're not going to die. Soi! Soi! Soi! Soi! Soi! Soi! Ghost! Ghost, mom, there's a ghost! - Yen... Yen... - Ghost, mom, there's a ghost! Yen's ghost! Mom it's Yen's ghost! Mom, it's Yen's ghost! Stop yelling! Or you'll wake the neighbors! There is no ghost whatsoever. Keep quiet and go to sleep. Hurry up! Go! Soi! Soi, why are you here? Soi, get up here with me. I've come to take my mother home. There's no mother here. Only my daughter and I. She is the mother of my child. Then... my grandchild and daughter are staying right here with me. I'll kill you. And take her home. You can kill me but can you kill everyone in this village? Thief! Everyone, please help! Thief and murderer! Help! Thief and murderer! Help! Thief and murderer! Help! Thief and murderer! Help! Bac is robbed! He needs our help! Thief and murderer! Soi might be a mute. But I'm not! I have a very big mouth. Thief! Thief and murderer! Thief! Thief, everyone! Someone broke into Bac's house. - Help! - What's wrong? Someone broke into Bac's house. Go help him. Where? Call Ky. Thief! Thief and murderer! What are you saying? He killed Gui? Take him to the police right away. Someone catches him! Get hold of him! Wait. It's Master Huynh. What are you doing? Why do you arrest master Huynh? Let him go! He came to my house and threatened to kill me and my daughter! Nonsense! Why would he kill his wife? It's Master Huynh. Oh my god. Let him go! What's up? Look! Tran Kim Mui was convicted for accessory to murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. Phan Luu Huynh was arrested on a full moon night. In his home, the police found 3 skulls, 1 necklace, 1 ring, 1 jade wristband and ID cards of his victims. Huynh was sentenced to death by the firing squad. Have you chosen a name for the baby?
