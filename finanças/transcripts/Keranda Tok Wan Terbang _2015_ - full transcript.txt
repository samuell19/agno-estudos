I refuse to get out, I refuse to get out, I refuse! To you the creature of Allah. I'm instructed to exorcise you out of this body. But you shall not claim anything from me in the hereafter. This is the agreement made between me and your master. Mael! Kila, it's alright, it's alright. It's nothing, everything's alright. Elder, what's the matter? It kept saying that it didn't want to get out, elder. It doesn't want to get out, there's no need to force it. Elder, if it doesn't want to get out, why don't we? Brother, don't say that. I felt the "saka" doesn't want to come out. I'm really afraid of looking at Ms. Betung. - Come out! - No, I don't want to! You refuse? Fine, wait a moment. Mael! Get me a bottle. My hand hurts. - Close it. - Close it, usin. Why me? Your hands are bigger, you do it. - Where's the cap, elder? - Where's the cap? There is none. Just close it with anything. Alright, elder, I'll try my best. - What is it? - It's ticklish, it licked me! Hey, don't mess around, I'm working right now. No one will die this month. Don't you tease me. You really like to joke at an unlikely time. Stop throwing dirt at me. You're filling it back up. I'm trying to work here. My patience is running thin. Don't make me throw this shovel at you instead of dirt. Now you're competing with me? You want to compete? Ms. Betung! - What's wrong with you? - usin! usin! Get in! What's wrong with you? Are you out of your mind? If you want to jump, wait until we reach Bukit Tagoh. Let your body shred to pieces and die there. What are you doing? It's like you're having seizures. - I had a nightmare. - A nightmare? A nightmare? - That hurt. - You're awake now, right? Don't sleep during daytime, you'll get nightmares. How can I stay awake? Look at how this uncle drives. I can go out and chase after it again, alright? Enough, don't sleep. Uncle, are we there yet? No answer. Maybe we'll get there in another three to four days. Enough, don't sleep, and don't cause a scene. You're such a troublemaker. Ms. Betung? Ms. Betung? Ms. Betung? Ms. Betung? Where is she? Ms. Betung? Ms. Betung, it's Epy! I'm here to collect the money for the cloth. Ms. Betung, where are you? I'm not sure she's even around. Where could she be? Miss Betung? Ms. Betung, it's Epy, Makcik Kundur's son. I'm here to collect the cloth money. Ms. Betung! Should I go inside? If I enter and get caught by JAIS, I'll be embarrased. Wan! Where are you off to? Head village! Just a moment, sir. - I'm from the house. - Yes, I know. - I want to go to the... - To the... prayer house? Yes, the prayer house! And this is the prayer house! So there's no need to look. You're already here. I was here when they built this prayer house. I really intended to come here. - So, maybe we should go inside? - If we're here, we have to go inside. Why are you still standing here? If you didn't stop me, I would've gone straight in. - Let's go. - Inside the prayer house, yes, yes. - After you. - Let's go. - I'm waiting for you. - Yes. The prayer house. Arrange the prayer mats together. usin, look at that, even a child can overtake the taxi. Look, even an elderly on foot can overtake the taxi. Uncle, when will we arrive? Relax, relax. Uncle, here's the fare. Thank you, uncle. If you happen to see your wife and kids... wish them a happy Eid from me, with my sincerest apologies, alright? Why did you say that? Based on his driving skills he won't get home until Eid. That's not nice, don't speak to an elderly in that manner. He might be in charge of this area. - Anyway, I'm hungry, let's eat. - Let's go. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you. Mr. Mael? Hey, Mr. Mael? Is anyone around? Mr. Mael? If the stall's closed, why is everything out, usin? usin, even if Mr. Mael's around, let's not look for him. He's clearly not here. This means free food. usin, eat up and I'll make you a drink. You'll make me a drink? I don't want much. - What do you want? - Just a coffee. Since the drinks are free, you're going for coffee? Let me make you a slushy. Eating for free? Don't even dream about it! I'm up here, look. What are you doing up there? Why were you creating a ruckus just now? - What's wrong? - What's wrong with you, Mr. Mael? Sitting there like a monkey, it looks ugly, Mr. Mael. Keep it down, I'm keeping an eye out for Epy. He came here the other day and stole ten packs of nasi lemak. - Epy's quite a naughty boy. - Seems so. What's with the large bags? I heard you went to Kuala Lumpur last week. Mr. Mael, let's not talk about Kuala Lumpur. My heart hurts whenever I hear "Kuala Lumpur", alright? That's right. Besides, it's such a long story. Okay, if it's long, shorten it. Mr. Mael, you're a stubborn man. If you want to know the story, watch this flashback. Enough, I no longer need your services. You can both go. What's this boss? We just started working today, boss. Don't tell me we're fired before Asar, usin? It's unfair, boss. Besides, what did I even do wrong? What did I do wrong, usin? What did I do? What you did? I gave you an easy job, alright? You can't even do a simple job? - What's this boss? - Cleaning glasses. How many glasses did you break today? Plenty, right? Sorry. Sorry. Sorry. - Sorry? - Sorry? This is for you. You can pick your feet and get out of here. usin! Boss, relax, it's our first day. Give us a chance. Furthermore, it's just some broken glasses. It's not like he broke your nose. Just forgive him. Just glasses? What about you? You, how many times did you eat? Six times! Let me repeat. Six times! Six times you ate the food. Six times. Let me repeat. Six times! Boss, can we just ask one thing? Get out of here right now! You really pushed your luck away, you know? When Mr. Dolah asked you to clean his orchard of weeds, you refused. You were being snobbish, you were more interested in Kuala Lumpur. Mr. Mael, it's not that we didn't want to. We did, but... - But what? - But unfortunately... I didn't ask you to sing, I wanted to know what your excuse was. Mr. Dolah, three black coffees. I'm not Mr. Dolah, he sold his shop. I'm Mr. Mael. Hold on. There's no need to be angry. She just got your name wrong. If you really want to know our excuse, watch this second flashback. Another flashback? "No cutting allowed" You're just lazy. You have so many excuses. Are you planning on eating this rice for free? It's not like we're broke. We usually pay. What's gotten into Foo Kok Keong this time? This is his latest craze. Because he's the only Chinese family in our village... he wanted to give out the red packet on a daily basis... and celebrate Chinese New Year every day. usin, what did you call him just now? - Foo Kok Keong. - I thought his name was Keong? - What's this? - Payment. "Please claim on Chinese New Years" Get out of the way! That's Tokwan. What's wrong with him? Tokwan! Hey, Tokwan? - Who are you? - It's Joyah, Tokwan. - What's wrong with the bike? - Joyah. I lost my keys. I was at the prayer house. I prayed at the prayer house. What else can I do, right? I think those kids at the prayer house took the keys. Did you see the keys? Be reasonable. When would we have seen them? Why are you smiling at me? Are you flirting with me? What's that thing hanging there? - Those are the keys. - The keys I see. They tricked me. They weren't there before. Where are you going? Since I have the keys, I can start the bike. So I'll head home now. The way home is that way, Tokwan. There's only woods that way. That's the problem with our villagers. You let outside contractors build the roads. They change the roads as they please. I used to go back this way! Turn around, turn around, there's no road that way. The bike needs to be overhauled, it keeps giving me trouble. Tokwan's really funny, and he forgets easily these days. Someone's jealous of my bike, it wasn't like this before. You need to report this. Why do we need to report it? Be careful, Tokwan. You might run into a pole. Ms. Betung? If I get caught, that'll be the end of me. What's that sound? This darkness is dangerous, if I get caught, I'm finished. Ms. Betung? Ms. Betung, why are you lying here? It's dangerous. Ms. Betung? Ms. Betung, what's wrong? Ms. Betung, where's the money? The money? Where's the money for the fabric? Mom asked me to collect it from you. Where do you keep it? Hurry up. Ms. Betung. Where's the fabric money, Ms. Betung? Let's finish everything here and here only, shall we? I didn't mean to shame my neighbour, but Ms. Betung keeps the "saka". Who knows what kind of magic she uses? She kept a lot of it. She said it's to help the villagers. Every Friday night, she'll burn the incense in her house. It looked like haze to me. I didn't mean anything. I just want to help the villagers if they seek help. I didn't even charge them. If they'd like to offer payment, I'll take it. The most important thing is that all villagers are safe, and in harmony. Aren't we all a family? Don't you know when to head home? It's already dawn. It the ghouls don't catch you, Ms. Betung's "saka" will. - I don't want to, mom. - Such a stubborn boy. - Hurry back home. - No. Let's go. Ms. Betung, we're just passing by. Thank you, brother. - I'm confused, usin. - Why? It feels like our village isn't as peaceful as it used to be. You know what? I agree. I'm really dissatisfied with our headman. How so? I suggested that we open up a disco here. In order to promote and nurture reading skills among the youth. He opposed to it. usin, do you know what a disco is? Why you, it's where you read books. That's called a "library", usin. No wonder he rejected it. usin, I'd like to talk about Ms. Betung. What about her? The villagers keep saying that Ms. Betung keeps the "saka", right? See, she agrees as well. Give me five. - Your hands are as cold as a corpse. - Whose hands? My mom called me home, usin. Where are you going? Who's going to accompany me? Luckily there's someone here. asan! Your mom called me too! Help me! I want to eat. Ms. Betung's ghost is looking for food! Ms. Betung! Ms. Betung! Who's going to settle the debt? Who's going to pay for the fabric? Ms. Betung! Ms. Betung! Don't die just yet. Please tell me where the money is first. Where is the money? Villagers! Ms. Betung is dead. Villagers! Ms. Betung is dead. Whose house is this? Why is there no one around? Address... This is my handwriting. Tokwan, it is me! Luckily no one saw it. Tokwan, found your way home? Timah, Fiona, what are you doing at my house? Have you forgotten where you live? You're here to steal my pandan leaves, aren't you? You were going to peep on me while I was sleeping! Dream on, I sleep with my boxers on. You have too good taste for your own good. We're going now, Tokwan. Poor Tokwan, his memory is getting worse. I feel sorry for him. I don't know about that. Kiah, do you know how Tokwan ended up with the nickname Tokwan Terbang? - I don't get it. - You don't know? I don't, tell me. If I remember correctly, when Tokwan was younger... Tokwan was famous for his expertise in flying the Roti Canai. While he was serving the Roti Canai. People loved his Roti Canai because of that. Since then he got the nickname Tokwan Terbang. It's because he's good at flying it. Roti Canai's ready! The bread, brother! The bread, brother! That makes no sense at all, Kiah. Hey, I'm wasting saliva telling you this story, and you say it makes no sense. Do you remember when Tokwan started working as the undertaker? Kiah, I think we're already late. Let's go home. You're afraid, aren't you? Me, scared? Nonsense. You're afraid that her "saka" will chase after you, right? Watch your mouth. RM50, RM100, RM150, I have a lot of money. Wow! It seems you have a lot of customers. Even this type can do well. The villagers can make do. Look, ladies and gentleman. Everyone misunderstands me. Just because I look like this, they think I'm selling my body. Darn it, now I lost count. Hold on, my turn's in another two months, right? Next month it's Mr. Leha's, then it's Tokwan Terbang. I need to talk to him. He's so problematic and hard to coax. I might get beaten as well. Tokwan Terbang, please. I need money. One, two three... can you say some greetings first? What if I had died! Relax, Anam. Ms. Betung's passed away. What do you mean, Epy? She passed away. She's dead. - She's passed away? - Yes, she's passed away. You have to be kidding. It's true, now I have to look for Tokwan Terbang. I want to ask him to dig the grave and bury Ms. Betung. Ms. Betung's passed away. - Who passed away? - Tokwan Terbang. No, not Tokwan Terbang, Ms. Betung! - Who passed away? - Tokwan. - Ms. Betung! - Ms. Betung. - Who passed away? - Ms. Betung. - Who passed away? - Tokwan! Tokwan Terbang's passed away! - Kila! - Brother asan! Wow Kila, you only see Brother asan, can't you see Brother usin at all? I see you too. Why are you here? Aren't you supposed to be in Kuala Lumpur? Honestly, while I was working there I kept thinking about you. That's why I came back. I couldn't live without you, Kila. Don't talk nonsense. Kila, actually we got... You got... you got what? What we got? Oh! Brother usin got haemorrhoids. In Kuala Lumpur there was no one who could treat his haemorrhoids. So we brought him back for traditional medication, right usin? Why you guys. Syakila! It's good that you're all here. I have to tell you, Ms. Bet... Tokwan Terbang has passed away! Tokwan Terbang passed away?! Yes, he passed away. Anyway, I have to tell the villagers. You guys got fired already, huh? You're already unemployed. Everyone knows. Peace be upon you. Anam, are you still doing the old work? Why you, even though you've been with him, don't let Kila know. - Brother. - Yes? You've been with Anam? That's old news. Enough, let's go. I'd like to go get ready before we visit the late Tokwan Terbang. Tokwan Terbang! Tokwan Terbang! Usually the Africans only sell watches in shops. Why come all the way out here? Go back! Don't get angry. Here. - Recognize me? - Who are you? It's Epy, I'm tired of always having to introduce myself. Epy? Who are your parents? I'm Makcik Kundur's son. I don't know you, your dad and each of your descendants. It doesn't matter, go change clothes we need to dig up a grave, hurry! A grave? Who died? Even if I told you, you wouldn't remember! Now hurry up so we can dig a grave! I'm a man of principles, I need to know who died first! - Ms. Betung! - Was that so hard? - Who's Ms. Betung? - See, you forgot anyway! Go change clothes, we're late! Hang on... hang on. Villagers, villagers! Auntie, Tokwan Terbang died! Auntie, Tokwan Terbang died! Listen to me villagers! Tokwan Terbang is dead! Villagers! Tokwan Terbang died! - Uncle. - What is it? What are you doing out at your age? Go home and pray! I wanted to tell you, Tokwan Terbang passed away. - Tokwan Terbang is dead. - What? - Tokwan Terbang is dead? - Yes, he's dead. I have to get going. Don't keep sitting around here again. I'm off, peace be upon you. Hey, Tokwan Terbang has passed away. What? Tokwan Terbang's dead? - We just saw him yesterday. - What did he die from? We don't know, we're going home now to get ready before we go to his house. We have to get going, alright? What's with the luggage? Don't tell me you got fired again? Uncle, watch your mouth. We intentionally brought these bags. It's alright, uncle. We'll get going. We'll meet you there later. Don't forget to update it in your "moment". Let's go. - Tokwan Terbang has passed away. - What? - What's the matter? - Do you need to scream out loud? Tokwan Terbang has passed away. I just saw him riding by the drains yesterday evening. Come, come, let's go, let's go. asan! Why did you stop here? What's the matter with you? I feel weird, usin. - Why? - This is his house. - Yes. - He's dead, right? Yes? So why is his house so silent? What were you expecting? Tokwan died, you want children to play with fireworks? Open up a fun fair? Do the dragon dance? That's not what I meant, usin. I feel weird, usin. Are you okay? Since when do you care about my feelings? Let it be. usin, when do you think his body will arrive? How should I know? You should, you know everything about this village. You wanted to become the headman. You said the current one's no good. - That you didn't like him. - What's wrong with you? You're my brother. I've been with you the past 24 hours. I got fired with you. My bag got thrown in front of you. I was with you in the slow taxi. How would I know when the body will arrive? - Why are you so dimwitted? - There's no need for foul words, usin. I overreacted. Enough, let's go to Kila's house. If the villagers arrive, we might have to clean the body, let's go. - Kila! - Kila! Brother asan's here and brought some biscuits, will you make us some drinks? Kila! Kila! Kila! Kila! There's no need to shout. She'll come out in no time. I'm puzzled, ever since I left Kila for Kuala Lumpur, she's been less affectionate. Previously I only wished for it and she'd appear. usin, I don't mean to gossip, but did you think about how Tokwan died? Even when he has a healthy diet? Bananas. Exactly. Why did Tokwan Terbang have the word Terbang (flying) in his name? You don't know? Do you want to know? Once upon a time... when Tokwan was still young, he was a Roti Canai server. When he was throwing the bread into the air... when it fell he couldn't catch it in time and it landed on his face. That's why his face is disfigured. - So he used to be handsome? - Yes, just like Karam Singh Wallia. - Do you know Shah Rukh Khan? - I do. He looked like his foot. - Look at her. - Kila! What are you doing? You might have a big body, but you're a wuss. This is the circle of life. Those who live shall die. Each will have their own part to play. It's the same with the deceased, understand? You're rambling, it's not like you know a dead person anyway. You never stop quizzing me. Don't think that I don't know. This. Who passed away? See, you don't even remember who died. You talk too much, focus on digging otherwise we won't be able to bury her. - What's wrong with you? - Like I don't know how to do it. You're even plate-tongued. Tokwan! Tokwan! - I'm busy. - What's that? What's wrong with you? I'm working here, don't disturb me. Tokwan! What's with the screaming? Why are you screaming in the middle of the night? Do you want to go to the stadium? You'll wake people up. Screaming out loud. What a troublemaker. I'm broke. What should I do? Who's there? Leave me alone, I'm already scared. Ms. Betung's "saka"! Ms. Betung's "saka"! If you want to get rid of your fears, you have to help me out. There's no need over there, come here. Tokwan, what's that? - Tokwan! - What? It's the living that are dangerous, why are you scared of those already buried? Tokwan! Tokwan! You peed your pants. Ghost, Tokwan Terbang! Saripuddin! Mael! Whatever your name is! Why is there a coffin here? Who passed away? Who passed away? I need to ask the villagers. Ms. Betung's "saka"! It's you! Where are you going? - I saw Tokwan Terbang's ghost. - Ghost? - What's wrong with you? - I think I saw a ghost, too. You saw a ghost too? How scary! - It's Ms. Betung's "saka". - Ms. Betung's "saka"? That's nothing, that's nothing. I just saw a ghost at the graveyard. - It's even scarier. - Tokwan Terbang's ghost? Did you pee your pants, Anam? It stinks, how nasty. I couldn't help it, Epy. It just came out. You're such a mess. Your pants are wet, Epy. Your pants are wet. - My pants are wet? - You peed as well. I'm scared as well, Anam! - What's that behind you? - Behind me? What's that? Who are you? Don't ask like that, it might strangle you. It's not even a ghost. - Who are you? - Chill. Kila, are you afraid of ghosts? No. Liar. Back when Ms. Betung's "saka" was after you, you wet yourself, didn't you? - Well? - That was ages ago. I'm not afraid anymore. I'm no longer scared. usin, what's wrong? Even if she's not afraid, there's no need to sulk like that. usin? - usin? - Brother. - What's wrong, usin? - What are you up to? - What? - Why, brother? It's nothing. Who passed away? It's even harder looking for the living than the dead. Stop, stop, stop. Kila, I think I just lost my heart. - Do you want me to check yours? - Why you! My heart hurts as well, Kila. What are you doing, usin? I thought you were Kila. Did both of you just see what I saw? - What did you see? - I saw something really tall. I saw something more scary. I was sitting with Kila and when I turned around, it wanted to kiss me, usin. - Really? - Really! Enough, don't make a fuss. I don't even know what that thing was. I think, what I saw, and you saw, were two different things. Yours was standing, but mine was sitting. I think this is all connected to Tokwan Terbang's spirit. - Tokwan Terbang's spirit? - Impossible. Spirits of the dead can't come back. - Unless... - Unless what? Unless the dead, the living, they can come back. - What are you saying, usin? - No, no. Unless... Slown down or you'll bump into me. - Did someone die? - Whose is this? Stop! It's Tokwan's ghost! Tokwan Terbang! - I'd like to ask you... - Speed up! Speed up! I just want... I'd like to ask something! usin. Our village's getting worse, usin. - Let's go to the Headman's house. - Let's go! Sir! Peace be upon you! Peace be upon you, Headman! Sir! Peace be upon you, sir! - Sir? - Sir! Sir! There's no point in yelling, I've been out here for a while now, but no sign of him. It's normal for him, he goes to bed early on Fridays. Sir, our village is no longer peaceful! That's right, sir. On my way here everyone were screaming and acting frantic for no good reason. This is all because of Tokwan Terbang's spirit. That's not right, sir. It's not, everyone knows Tokwan is dead. He's a ghost sir. I forget things, but I think I'd remember if I had died. This voice seems familiar. Where have I heard it? Tokwan Terbang's ghost! Run! Why are they screaming? Come back! Why are they screaming? That won't make them come back. Call them like this. They're still screaming. Tokwan, they were accusing you. I'm not even dead yet. - Why didn't you go with them? - I was about to leave. - Why are you still here? - I'm going now. - Send my regards when you see them. - Hey! Tokwan sends his regards! - I'm not dead yet. - Not yet? Mosquito. Can you still see it? Who's knocking in the middle of the night? - I'd like to ask you... - Tokwan's ghost! What's the matter? She fainted on the floor! Hi. Peace be upon you. What a relief, I finally met someone. All night, people have just been screaming and yelling at me. It's like they've seen a ghost. We don't have ghosts in our village, right? Even you have the guts to sit here by yourself at night. Since we're already sitting together, I'd like to ask... do you happen to know who passed away today? Okay, I get it, you were answering silently. But I can't hear it. I'm Tokwan, the undertaker. Perhaps you know me because you nodded a bit. I'd like to ask a question, alright? Just one. Do you know who passed away today in our village? No wonder you're so brave. Everyone's afraid of you since you're not human. I get cramps in these situations. Let's just relax here. My bike, if only it was near, but it's quite far from me. Now it's following me. So you're afraid, I only read a bit, you know? Do you think I'm empty-handed? Hold on tight, you might fall off... Did you see what was sitting behind Tokwan? I saw it, usin. There. Again. What's going on with this village, brother? I don't understand why Tokwan Terbang is so vengeful that he haunts everyone. That's what I don't get. Maybe if he was practicing black magic. I feel that somebody must have done something to cause Tokwan's unrest. That might be it. It's you, usin! Do you remember when you stole from his rambutan tree? At the back of his house. He even replaced it with cactuses. - It was you! - Yes, it's me. I stole them, but you ate them. You're even worse than I am. Remember when he came back from his Isyak prayers? You stole his shoes and replaced them with high heels. Your mom's heels, imagine that. He went back home in high heels. You're even worse. Kila, in this story both of us would like to apologize. It's because of us that you're being haunted. That's right, Kila. I'm sorry. That's not entirely true. Actually, I did something wrong to Tokwan Terbang as well. - I've... well, I k... - You kissed Tokwan? - No! - That's ridiculous. If that was true, Tokwan would tell the entire village about it. Why, you. One day, I saw his money fell out of his pocket and I kept it. - How much? - RM3.50. How did you... Brother! usin, I can't take it anymore. I'm wheezing, I'm asthmatic, usin. I'm exhausted, what's going on? I think Tokwan's looking for vengeance. What do we do now, usin? Kila? Okay, hold on, okay. I think... we should ask for Ms. Betung's help. Alright? Kila's right, usin. We need her help. Furthermore, Kila's the smartest one in our village... she has the certificate from Giat Mara. What's the connection between Syakila and Ms. Betung? usin, it's like this. We have to follow Kila to look for beats. I mean, to see Ms. Betung. If you don't want to come with, just stay here. Let's go, I don't mind. Ms. Betung it is. usin, what's wrong? usin, what's wrong? What's wrong, usin? - What? - Where's your bike? - I left it at the graveyard. - Can you talk with more sense. Why would you bury your bike in the graveyard? I wanted to call you stupid, but you're not, you're beyond that. Save some idiocy at home. Don't make me punch you. Then you'll be complaining in Facebook and Twitter. - What's with the stupidity? - Watch your mouth. Watch your mouth when you're with me, I get it! I wasn't scolding you, I was advising you. It's true I left my bike at the graveyard when I saw Tokwan's ghost. I was so scared so I left my bike and ran. I'm tired, Epy. Carry me. Don't be so ridiculous right now, okay? You're such a pain. Like the saying goes, you and my fist are never far apart, get it? Once I punch you, you'll be gone as well. Relax, Epy. I was just kidding. This is Nana's bicycle. Let him be. Hurry up. - Hurry up. - I don't know how to ride it. Get down, get down. You're only a man on the outside. What a useless man. Epy, let me go, don't hold me back. - Anam! - What? - There's a "saka" behind us? - What "saka"? The grim reaper. Help! Help! Someone's trying to steal my bike! Anam, push! Ghost! Help, ghost! - When will the body arrive? - I have no idea. - Which hospital? - I'm not sure. Who sent him to the hospital? He doesn't have any children. That's right, I didn't hear any ambulance driving into our village. Does anyone know when the body will arrive? - We don't know, sir. - I don't know, sir. Who's there? What are you doing there? Who is that? Right now, this is our only hope. Hold on. - Brother. - What, Kila? - Is Tokwan here? - No. Why does her house look so different tonight? That's right, the doors are open, as are the windows. Her house seems... to have undergone some kitchen renovations. - What's wrong? - You're talking nonsense. usin, come here. Why is the smell of incense so strong at her house? What's wrong with you? She's a shaman. Of course it'll smell of incense rather than durians. - Stop fooling around. - Let's go, get up. Who should I ask? The dead just passes away, regardless of the timing. A marriage has an invitation. I'm finished. Who's there? Wait, hold on, hold on. No! Wait! What's wrong with everyone? I only wanted to ask... Ms. Betung, peace be upon you. Peace be upon you, Ms. Betung. It's sinful if you don't reply. Go upstairs. Sit down. Where are they? Seems like we won't be getting any news anytime soon. We have no idea when they'll arrive. It's alright, let's just wait. They'll be here soon. Ms. Betung, why are you fogging our faces? We don't have sinusitis. Why don't we recite the Yasin while we wait? That seems good. Let's go. Friends, let's recite the Yasin. We have nothing to do anyway. Epy, why is everyone gathered at Tokwan's house? - What's up? - How should I know? Maybe there's a function? He looked just fine at the graveyard. As the village's reporter, I have to know what's going on. There's no need. Epy, try to be more sociable. Even though you're dark-skinned, black, shiny, don't waste your potential. How rude. You're talking about me, but you're the same. - My face is the only dark part. - Enough. If you want to go, just go. - Come with me, Epy. - You're so annoying, I don't want to. Epy, come with me before I embarrass you in public. How rude. Enough. Where are you going? Wait for me, I'm coming. You stole my bike and now you're trying to get away. Come here! Don't run! - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. - Peace be upon you. - You stole my bike. Wow, it seems there is a party, but we weren't invited. How could you not invite us? It's good that we're here, isn't that right, Epy? Yes, what a coincidence. What are you talking about, Epy? What party? What coincidence? Yes, it seems that everyone's gathered here, but you didn't invite us. - Didn't Tokwan Terbang pass away? - When did he pass away? - Just now. - Who told you? Anam told us. What's with the crowd? Oh, it's probably a surprise birthday party for me. But my birthday is still far away. Peace be upon you. - Wan, you're not dead? - Why would I be dead? The whole village told us you passed away, Wan. The whole village? I can't take it. Everywhere I go, people are screaming like they saw a K-pop idol. I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. I don't know how it ended up like this. Anam, you're really useless. You can't even do a simple task. I already told you, I didn't mean to. - Peace be upon you. - Peace be upon you too. What's with the ruckus? We're having a meeting just now. I heard that Tokwan Terbang passed away, is this true? Why did you leave the body with its eyes open, we need to close them. Then, we'll have to cover the body with this cloth. After this, should there be any more deaths in our village... at least we know that the body should be covered like this, don't forget. - How is he still alive? - He's not dead yet. - He's not dead? - He's not dead. Tell us what happened. The entire village thinks you're dead. Now, you're alive. Please tell me. I'll send an invitation first if I die. Don't worry, you'll get an invitation if I pass away. An invitation? I can't live like this anymore. I'd like to move out, sir. I'd like to move away. I'd like to end this suffering. He was the one who told me someone's dead. He asked me to dig the grave. After that, I forgot who passed away. So if you're not dead... who is? Brother, I don't feel good about this. Don't say that, what if she hears you. It's fine, as long as Tokwan's spirit stops haunting us. Kila. Get up! Get up! That's how it goes. That's why I went everywhere with the coffin. I was looking for the person who passed away. I'm still alive. Don't make me slap you. This is all because of Anam. Because of him, Ms. Betung was buried late. What's wrong with you, Epy? Didn't I tell you I was sorry? Enough, there's no need to argue here. Everything's settled. The three of us got the worst experience. Since the beginning we thought that it was Tokwan who passed away. Okay, so, if Tokwan's dead, Ms. Betung's dead as well. My question is, who died first? It must be Ms. Betung. Looking at the face, it has to be him. Ms. Betung died first! You're both wrong. Tokwan died first. What is all this? Right now, the body's here. Why don't we complete the process? That's what's important. The grave has already been dug. What are you waiting for? Don't quarrel, if you're wondering who died first, just keep quiet like me. You still want to talk. Let's go. - The rest as well. - Over there. The body's over there. Be careful. Who passed away?
