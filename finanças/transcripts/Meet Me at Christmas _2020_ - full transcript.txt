This program is rated G and is suitable for general audiences. Go, go, go, go! Quick! Quick! Oh, oh, the scarf! Scarf! - Yeah, good idea. - Okay. Excuse me. The only way we're gonna win this is if we standout. Okay. Yes. Let's see. I don't know. It still needs something. Look, look. Mind if I borrow your hat? I'll give it right back. Yeah, sure. Go for it. Thanks. That's very good. Yeah! Look at this. First place. Not too shabby. We make a good team. - So... - Uh, oh no, you go. Where to next? Uh, how about the Ferris wheel? Really? There might be a long line. Looks pretty short. But if you don't want to, we don't have to. I think I saw a reindeer ring toss somewhere. No, I would love to go on the Ferris wheel with you. Okay. Mom, the snowman competition winners. Hey, thanks for your help today. Our snowman wouldn't be complete without you. Are you coming to the Christmas tree lighting tonight? I, for one, am a huge fan of Christmas tree lightings. But you have to bring an ornament. The whole town decorates together. And legend has it, that if you make a wish right when the tree lights up, it will come true. Last year, I wished for an astronaut Barbie and I got her. Okay, ladies. I'm sold. Cool. See you guys tonight. Bye. Hi. Are you sure you're okay to do this? We could probably still get off. No. This is great. I just have a small fear of heights. - Ah! - It's okay. Okay, just don't look down. I won't look down. Yeah, this is great. See? Not that bad. I can definitely think of worse ways to spend an evening. So about tonight, would you do me the honor of being my date? I'd love to. Oh, do you have the time? Actually, my mom is probably wondering where I am. Almost six. Wow, I love that pocket watch. Thanks. Belonged to my gramps. Some people might say it's out of style, but I think timeless things are cool. Then you'll love tonight. The tree at Snowfall Lodge is the last to light up before Christmas. Then we're on for tonight? Yeah, but I think you're forgetting something. What's that? We still don't know each other's names. I suppose you're technically right, but we've only known each other for six hours. I don't usually get my name out till at least the seventh. Oh, well, that's great because I usually don't give mine out until at least the eighth. And I mean, I know it's the '90s, but I'm old school. I obviously like old school. I look forward to officially meeting you tonight. Well, then, I'll see you at seven. I'll be there waiting for you, ornament in hand. Our florist lost our bouquets order, and now they can't get white peonies in time. And our wedding's tomorrow morning. I'm so sorry. Just give me a moment. Not only do I not have a bouquet, I have no idea what we should do about my niece. I think I need your help. Eloise is the cutest flower girl imaginable. But she also refuses to walk down the aisle. I don't know. Maybe I'll just go flowerless for our wedding. What kind of wedding would it be with her flowers? This is Joan, our resident problem-solver at Paige's flowers. My son is also getting married this week. That's great. Congrats. Aw, thanks. Congratulations to you two. Now, I know white peonies are beautiful, but they aren't really the best for a Christmas bouquet, but I've got a different idea. So how about we do red and white roses? We can arrange them with other things to really bring out the season. It is almost Christmas after all. Um... And a few skimmia winter berries. What do you think? Wow. I love it! Even more than my original vision. Oh, I'm so glad. Seriously, you're a miracle worker. Your son's lucky to have your help. Where is he getting married? Oh, actually, at the Snowfall Lodge. We're having like a friends and family, small wedding. Up on the mountain? It's beautiful there. Yeah, my husband and I met there. What a gift for the two of you to see your son get married there. Yeah, it will be. Um, I'm gonna finish arranging in this and then I can ring you up. That'd be great. Allow me. Oh, what a festive arrangement. Beautiful work, Joan. Thanks, Paige. Joan literally just saved our wedding. That's why we love her. Thanks again. Sure. Oh, and use a stuffed animal for tomorrow. For your niece. If she's having trouble going down the aisle, have one of her parents hold her favorite stuffed animal at the altar and you'll be sure to get her there. I love it. - Merry Christmas. - You too. These'll be ready this afternoon. I don't know how you do it, girl. Hmm! That's very sweet. It's about time you have another look at starting your own company. That was a long time ago. When Morgan passed away, I just knew it would take too much time. It wouldn't be fair to Liam. Joan, I don't know how we're gonna get through the Christmas rush without you. You're gonna do just fine. Do you need anything before you head out? No, I'm all set. Thank you so much for loaning me the van, it's filled to the brim. Well, it's not Santa's sleigh, but it's amazing how much you can fit in that thing. - Okay. Duty calls. - Okay. Hey, how's it going? How am I ever gonna leave this place? Nothing would make her happier than to see you branch out on your own. Well, now's not the time Vanessa. Speaking of which I better get going. Gotta miss that traffic. Gotta avoid that Christmas shoppers rush. Last call to hang ornaments! Get ready to make those wishes. The lighting is about to begin. Um, excuse me. Oh, sorry. I didn't see you there. Guess I was taken in by this beautiful tree. Okay. But um, could you move? I'm trying to get a shot of that beautiful tree. Oh, of course. You know, it is Christmas. The season of good cheer and love and being polite to strangers, admiring trees. Okay. I'm sorry. Let me start over with that. Excuse me, madam, could you please move so I can get a shot of this beautiful tree? Better but not great. By the way, your lens cap is on. Yeah. I knew that. Lens cap is still on. Mom. - Hi. - Perfect timing. How are you? Yeah. Good. How are you? - Good, good. - Good. There you go. Ooh, hot chocolate upon arrival. No marshmallows. Just how you like it. You're so sweet. Where's Katie? Um, I think she's looking for our wedding coordinator. Anyway, we're all set up, beautiful suite upstairs, and got you the room with the best view. Wow. What service. - Yeah. - Hmm. Ahh! Okay, you gave me the good news. What aren't you telling me? What do you mean? I know my son and I know when you're nervous to tell me something. What did I always tell you growing up? Moms can read minds. Exactly. It's nothing, it's just I um- I haven't made my job decision yet. I need to tell them. Hmm. I know it can be stressful, Liam. But it's a good problem to have. How many kids graduate college, land an internship, and within a few months, they have offers from the top two consulting firms in New York? But I get it. Your decisions don't just affect you now. I don't know, Mom, what if my... my gut is telling me something isn't right? Then you need to listen to it. All of a sudden it's like everyone has all these expectations for you. I wish I could tell you that gets better. You know, you try to please everyone, you end up pleasing no one, including yourself. You're about to start a whole new chapter in your life, honey. Own it, and whatever job you choose, you'll have my support. Thanks, Mom. I needed to hear that. Yeah, of course. You're still my son, no matter what chapter you're in. Right. I don't know what to do. I can't believe she quit on us like that. Is Katie okay? Katie? You okay? The wedding coordinator quit! What? What happened? She apologized, but apparently got a last-minute celebrity elopement opportunity. She's on her way to Aspen as we speak. Okay. It's gonna be fine. We've got four days till Christmas Eve. A lot of the big things are already handled. Right, but the coordinator left a lot of small things not handled. Last-minute details can really add up. We'll just have to do it ourselves. Maybe we just need to scratch a few things. No, it's your wedding day, Katie. We're not scratching anything. Oh, sorry, Joan. This is my Uncle Beau. Oh, yeah. We actually met. Yeah. Hello, again. Hello. Why don't we get you some eggnog? Eggnog has a way of making everything better. Eggnog sounds like a perfect idea. Your parents are coming in this afternoon, right? Yeah. They should be taking off shortly. Good, well, between your parents and me, we'll get everything done. And I'll help too. Oh, thanks. But that won't be necessary. If you think it's gonna be easy for the three of you, just think of how much we'll get done with the four of us. Well, six of us. We're not letting you guys do this alone. We'll split the list between all of us. Yeah, well in that case, we'll be fine. And we don't wanna keep you from your photography. I hope you got that perfect shot of a tree, by the way? I did, actually. Thank you so much, Beau. - That was for you? - Yeah. Well, Beau offered to do the photography for the wedding. Have to get a shot of the special tree, right? Liam said his dad always talked about that magical night he had with you at the tree lighting. Yeah, magical's a good word. Yeah, he said, he fell in love with you before he even knew your name. He always made me feel like the luckiest girl in the world. That's my parents. One sec. So you uh, photograph professionally? I'm sorry. Mom, he's a very famous travel photographer. Beau Sullivan. Haven't you heard of him? You know, you do look familiar. Really? I mean, I tend to stick behind the camera. Yeah, honestly, I still can't believe you offered to shoot our wedding. Kind of feels like having Michelangelo offer to repaint your kitchen or something. No. Are you kidding me? Look, anything that makes Katie this happy is as good a project at the Sistine Chapel. I'm just saying. That's very sweet of you, Beau. You know, you're right. If we all work together, it'll be a breeze. Mom and Dad just called to see their flight is canceled. What? Canceled? Not delayed? Apparently, Vermont is getting a nor'easter. The earliest they expect to arrive is three days from now. Oh, boy. I'm gonna need another eggnog. Okay. Okay. It's gonna be okay. Um, alright, what if me and you took one half of the list and, Mom, you Beau took the other half? - Beau and me? - Yeah. Well, it's like you said... And I think the word she used was a breeze. - Yes. - Isn't that right? That's right. Come on. It'll be fun. All right. Which half of the list is ours, Katie? Oh, um, that is half. It's a two-page list. Oh, okay. I mean, just so, to confirm, nothing on here has been done yet? Oh, I'm sorry, I should have updated that. I already took care of the napkin rings. I picked them up in town on my way here. So you can cross that out. Great. Don't worry, Katie. We'll get it done. Are you sure? If it's too much, we understand. No, it's not too much. Honestly, we're so grateful for you two. So grateful. Liam, we should run to our fittings. Okay. Why don't we meet you guys for the cake tasting this afternoon? Perfect. Sounds great. Yeah, we should... - Yeah. - Yeah. Coordinator sure left a lot to the last minute. Yeah, more than I would've expected. But, you know, if we organize ourselves, we'll be fine. Right, and, well, we already know we have the napkin rings covered. Yeah. Oh, and the second item on the list. I've got flowers in my car and I'm arranging them on Thursday. Okay. We're on a roll. Yeah, we can get a lot done in town too, before the bakery. Okay, so let's bring in your flowers, and then we'll hit the road. Sounds good. - After you. - Okay. Are we decorating for a Christmas visit with Santa or a wedding? Do you have something against Christmas. No, it's not that. That's good because this is nothing compared to the wreaths and trees that we're gonna need it. Look, I realize that the wedding is on Christmas Eve, but do they really want it to be this Christmassy? "You can never have too many wreaths and trees. "I want it to feel like a Christmas winter wonderland." Are you really surprised? They fell in love at a Christmas party. I don't really do Christmas. You don't do Christmas? Do you also not do fun? No. It's just, I think, no matter how much you decorate an event room, you can't compete with the season's natural beauty. Well, you're right. You sure you don't have more of a love for Christmas than you're letting on? I'm a full-fledged Grinch. Okay, well we have about three hours before we need to meet the kids. Yeah, four days to coordinate the ultimate Christmas Eve wedding. Hmm. Well, come on Ebenezer. Let's check it out inside. Unless you have a planned visit with the Ghost of Christmas Past? Starting to wonder if that might be you. The ceremony is scheduled to take place here, in the Holly Room. Ooh. I love the name. We have Christmas events booked up in all our other event spaces throughout the week. However, this room is all yours to do as you wish, until the big day. The Snowflake Room is reserved for the reception. However, it will be in use at all other times. AKA, this space is off-limits until the morning of the reception. You'll have to do all your advanced preparation work in the Holly Room. Oh, that should be fine. It's beautiful. Thank you so much. Wedding coordination can be extremely stressful. Should you require any assistance, I'm afraid I won't be much help. Last-minute wedding issues aren't really my thing. You are a concierge, correct? Yes, of course. Merry Christmas. Isn't it perfect? I mean, just picture it with some garland and lights and plenty of poinsettia arrangements. Are we decorating for a wedding or for a production of the "Nutcracker"? How many more of those lines do you have up your sleeve? Got about three more ready to go. So, how do you do it? Do what? Stay so excited about Christmas? It's almost childlike. Are you call me childish? Childlike, not childish. Mm-hmm. Ah, you know, I've loved Christmas since I was a girl. - Hmm? - Yeah. And I always wanted to make the holidays extra special for Liam. My husband passed away right before Christmas when Liam was little. I'm sorry. Yeah. But, you know, I knew no matter what that I wanted Liam to feel that Christmas magic that I felt when I was little. Like the ones I spent at Snowfall Lodge growing up. Wait, wait, wait. You used to come here? Yeah, it was my family's Christmas tradition through college. And my husband and I used to bring Liam when he was little. Certainly, you must've felt some Christmas miracles growing up? Yeah. I'm not so sure I believe in Christmas miracles. Maybe you're just not looking hard enough maybe. Maybe. So why do they call you the Lone Wolf? Who calls me the Lone Wolf? Global Photography Magazine, apparently. I felt silly that I didn't know your name. So I did a little internet search. Well, no, I'm sorry. I never read that article. Why not? You don't like the headline? "Beau Sullivan, Lone Wolf Photographer "Continues to Innovate." I take photos. I don't write headlines. Mm-hmm. So innovative that he forgets to take the lens cap off. Come on. I was distracted. I guess they call me that because I do all my shoots on my own, in far off places. I'm kind of a one-man-band. Oh. What? No, it just seems a little lonely? - Not at all. - Hmm. Look, I made a vow years ago that I was gonna have a job where I'd travel the world and never have any two days be the same. But you didn't wanna do that with other people? If I had, I don't think I could have been as successful. I only rely on myself, less goes wrong that way. I've been able to live out the dream I had since college. It's actually paid off. I mean, how many people can say that? Yeah, true. I guess when I think of some of my dreams, I just always wanted to share them with other people. Yeah, well, I have not figured out a way to do that yet. Where did you say you went to college? Boston College. Go Eagles. Why? How about you? Oh, Elmstead University. Go Beavers. This is, right? Yeah. Aw. I used to come here every year growing up. You know, they have this delicious gingerbread doughnut but... They only make them one week a year? How'd you know that? I actually spent a Christmas here too, many, many years ago. Maybe our paths crossed. Yeah, you know, there is something familiar... Sorry. It's probably work. Yeah. I need to take this. Go right ahead. Merry Christmas. Please feel free to take a number, miss. Thank you. Number three. Number three, please. A gingerbread doughnut, please. It's your lucky day. Second to last one. They sold out fast today. Number four. Number four, please. Number four, please. She's number four. Oh, no, I think I'm number five. Pretty sure you're four. I'm five. Better get that last doughnut. Miss. Hi. Could I get a gingerbread doughnut, please? Thanks. My conscience won't let me eat this alone. And I won't sleep well tonight if you don't share it. No, really, it's yours. What about you? Me? I'm okay. I have a bunch of stuff I need to do that I forgot about. Well, maybe it can wait one minute. This really is unbelievable. The hype doesn't even do it justice. You know the only thing that could make it better? - What? - Is a cup of hot chocolate. Can I grab you one? Yes, please. Marshmallows? - Three. - Three? Well, any more and it's too sweet, and any less, you'd wish you had more. - Oh. - There's two hot chocolates. Thanks. Merry Christmas. Thanks so much. Well, I suppose I should let you get back to those big plans tonight. Oh, yeah. Lots of big stuff on the agenda. Okay. I'm a terrible liar. I have zero plans. Really? I only said that, so you wouldn't feel bad taking the doughnut. Truth is I'm on vacation with my family and was just planning on exploring for the day. No way? I'm in the exact same situation. Maybe it's fate. Excuse me. Do you two wanna be partners for the snowman building contest? Sure. We're in. Great. What are your names? She's number four. And he's number five. Number five? - Oh. Yeah. - Excellent. Thank you. What would you like? Two gingerbread doughnuts. Yep. That's right. Yeah. The wedding's on Christmas Eve. So I can take an assignment as early as the 26th. Yeah. What about New Year's? Somewhere new? Okay. All right. Thanks. Yeah. Let me know. See ya. All right, these are too good to not get you one. - Thanks - Oh, sure. You know, the kids are gonna be here, any minute now. That watch. You don't see those every day. Yeah. It was my grandfather's. This is gonna sound really strange... It's you. How are our favorite wedding coordinators? Good. We're great. Couldn't be better. So, you two ready to try some cake? Yeah. Yeah. - Okay. - Let's go. Can't wait. No, this is definitely the one. What flavor is this? This literally tastes like Christmas. Smooth white chocolate buttercream with just a hint of peppermint. It's really delicious. Thank you. Oh! It's gonna be amazing. Makes you wanna curl up by a crackling fire, doesn't it? - Mm-hmm. - Yeah. Oh, I almost forgot. It wouldn't be the perfect Christmas confection without a perfect Christmas wedding topper. Represents the tree at the Snowfall Lodge. Excuse me. I'll be right back. Wanna tell her now? Tell me what? Okay, well, we have a little surprise. After the reception, we're gonna have all the guests attend the tree lighting. A way to honor the love story that you and dad had. I don't know what to say. The way dad used to describe love at first sight, I didn't think something like that was possible. Then I met Katie. I knew exactly what he was talking about when he saw you at that tree. Your love story's part of our story, Joan. It's a really sweet gesture. I'm just so glad that the wedding guests will be able to take part in a town tradition. That way they'll be able to hang ornaments. And make wishes. It's really wonderful. Your dad would have loved it. Isn't it a great idea, Uncle Beau? Isn't Joan's love story's so romantic. Yeah. Very romantic. I had no idea. Yeah. Love at first sight is such a rare thing. It certainly is. I was starting to think you weren't coming. Oh, you were expecting me? Sorry, no. I thought you were somewhere else. Ah. No, I just noticed you're wearing a Elmstead U hat. I'm a sophomore there. Oh, cool. I'm actually starting in the fall. Well, my friends and I are over just over here. If you wanna join us? I'm actually kind of waiting for someone. But I don't know if he's still coming. Well, you're welcome to wait with us. Thanks. I'm Joan, by the way. I'm Morgan. Joan? You slipped out rather quickly after the cake tasting. Oh, sorry about that. I just wanted to change before dinner. So we're just gonna pretend? - Pretend? - Pretend we never met. Well, we actually didn't, technically. Come on, number four. Oh, shh, don't call me that. Look, I'm sorry I didn't show up for the tree lighting. - I should explain. - No, you really shouldn't. No, I owe you an explanation. Beau. Everything happened exactly as it should have. You standing me up that night was the best gift you could have ever given me. If things had been different, I never would've met my husband or had Liam. Okay. You're right. I'm still sorry. No. No apology necessary. But can we keep this between us? I never told Liam that the night I met his dad, I had spent a romantic day with someone else. I don't wanna tarnish his memory of that story. Yeah, you heard how he talked about it today, right? There you two are. - Hey. - Hi, honey. Hey, I know we said we'd do dinner tonight, but think it's cool if we actually did breakfast tomorrow morning, instead? Bunch of the wedding party just arrived and they wanted to head into town. Do some last-minute Christmas shopping. - Yeah. - Yeah, that's fine, sweetie. Actually, why don't you two join us? No, no. We have a lot of planning to do tomorrow. - Yeah, yeah. - Some Christmas wrapping to do. And gonna get some dinner, take it to my room. Really? You sure, Mom? Yeah, yeah. Have a good time. - I'll see you both tomorrow. - Okay, have a good night. Well, what about you, Beau? No, you know, I really need to track down my editor. You have fun though. All right. Have a good night. I'm assuming you want the tree over there. Oh, I was actually thinking over there. Really? Yeah. You don't think so? Well, no, you know, it's just I'm a photographer. I kind of have an eye for these things. You want it on the right? Well, that's where the Christmas roses and holly are going. I'm a florist, I kind of have an eye for these things too. The tree is going to look perfect right there in the middle. Are you guys coming for breakfast? Santa's gonna be there. Yep. Sounds great. We'll be right there. Joan, can we talk about this? I guess Katie settled where the tree's gonna go. Look, I completely respect that you don't want Liam and Katie to know about our past. But after seeing you all these years later, I wanna explain what happened with the tree lighting. The tree lighting that means so much to Liam, he custom made a model of it to go on his wedding cake? Yes. And I don't wanna take away from any of that. And I appreciate that because this isn't just about you and me. It's Liam's memory of his dad. And I don't mean to be insensitive, but can we just try to put that day behind us? You're a great guy, but look at who we've become. We couldn't be more different. So you think fate knew what it was doing? Ending our story at that Ferris wheel? Yeah, it did. Okay. So then why do you think it brought us back together now? So, how's your list going? - Fine. - Fine. That's good. Yeah, we still have three days till Christmas Eve and the room already looks incredible. So when are you guys moving to New York? Oh. Actually, Uncle Beau, we're not. You're not? Yeah. Thanks for your advice, Mom. But I turned down the job offers this morning. New York just wasn't the right fit. Oh. You don't have any other offers at the moment, do you? No, but he has a lot of prospects here in Colorado. In the meantime, Katie's been absolutely killing it with her job at Dr. Perkins. That's great. I have no doubt that you're gonna be an incredible vet one day. But Liam, you know, you stayed home and commuted during college to save money. And I just always thought that you wanted to go someplace new after graduation, you know? Someplace where you could spread your wings and live out your dreams. Yeah, who says you have to leave your roots to do that? Doesn't that seem a bit risky to turn down two jobs right before you get married? Yeah. I get how it can seem like that, but I've got a feeling everything's gonna work out exactly as it should. 'Kay. Something wrong, Beau? No, no. No. I don't know, it doesn't seem like the most responsible move to me. - Well, actually, I... - Responsible? Liam is incredibly responsible, Beau. I never questioned that. When Liam says he's gonna do something he follows through. Okay, Mom. Liam, that's our reminder. We should get going. Okay. I gotta work on my vows. And I need to finalize the dinner seating. I might need some help with the layout later. So play nice, you too. When he says he's gonna do something he follows through. Was that just about Liam? I was simply stating the facts. I'm sorry, but you were being rude. Rude? How was I being rude? You were judging my son. No, it seems to me I was just being protective of my niece. Finding the right job takes time. Weren't you just saying yesterday how happy you are that you followed your professional dreams? Sure, but everything changes when you bring someone else into the mix. So you're saying that you can't follow your dreams and allow yourself to be close to someone? It's the only way that it's worked for me. You know, why don't we split up the list today and work separately? Yeah? Fine. I do better working solo. So you keep saying. Fine. So does that cover seating for everyone? Don't think we figured out Dr. Perkins. Oh, your boss? Oh. Uh... Coulda sworn I wrote him down here. He's single. I don't want him to feel like he was thrown at a random table, you know? No, of course. Maybe we should get Joan's advice. Yeah, we kind of split up the work today. - Really? - Yeah. It's easier that way. Uh-huh. About this morning. You should know the New York decision was mutual. I thought Liam turned down those jobs 'cause it didn't feel like a good fit for him. Yeah. That was part of it, but that's what's so special about Liam. When he says good fit he isn't just talking about himself. He's factored in what's best for both of us. So you don't wanna go to New York? New York's great, but I love my life here and my job. And the main reason we wanted to stay is we don't have family in New York. I don't want my future children to be far from family, where they see relatives only once or twice a year. I'm really sorry that I wasn't around more when you were growing up. That's okay. I don't judge you, Uncle Beau, for being busy. I guess I just didn't understand at the time why my favorite uncle always seemed to be in such a rush to get away. But the important thing is that you're here now. There's nowhere I'd rather be. I'm really sorry about breakfast. Ah, your heart was in the right place. I know Liam will get a job soon. He's the best. So are you. You two have the right priorities. You know, I can't believe I'm saying this, but you think we should? Well, I'd love to, but that's my maid of honor. I've got so much left prep left to do at the inn, but you should. I don't think they're gonna let me be a one-man team. Oh, actually, I think I know the perfect person to take my place. Who? - Hey, Joan. - Oh, hi, Katie. - Beau. - Hey. Is there any way you could take my place at the snowman building competition? Oh, my snowman building days are over. You know, I thought mine were too, but I think we should go for it. What do you say? Are you two partners? We are. Great. Good luck. - Shall we? - Okay. - Okay. Yeah, yeah, yeah. - I'll get the sticks. Yes. Get 'em. All right, we need a nose. - We need a nose. - Oh, yeah, the nose! Oh, oh, oh! Check it out! Yeah, cool snowman. Okay. I'm gonna get a hat! Yeah. Good, good, good. Okay. Woo! - Yes! - Yes! - Yeah! - Woo! - I like it. - Okay. You know it's too bad they don't have snowman making in the Olympics. Oh, yeah. You think we'd make the team? We would win the gold. I owe you apology for this morning. I shouldn't have drawn such quick conclusions about Liam. He's a great kid. And you're right. I have nothing to worry about. I'm sorry for my rudeness. Thank you. I appreciate that. And, listen, I'm sorry if I had been a little strange, it's just been a lot to process being here and seeing you again. Ah, don't worry about it. And as long as we're making peace left and right, I wonder if maybe you'll consider bringing me back as your co-wedding coordinator. I realize you don't need me, but I'm definitely more effective when I'm working with you. Doesn't sound like something Beau Sullivan would say. Yeah, well, Beau Sullivan never had to finalize seating for a wedding. I have no idea what to do with Dr. Perkins. - The Vet? - One and only. Oh, table eight with my cousin, Kelsey. - Yeah? - Yeah. She runs a pet grooming company and she happens to be single. So at the very least they'll talk shop and maybe they'll be sparks too. I love it. Okay, so, a florist, a wedding coordinator, and now a matchmaker. I'm impressed. You know what? I think I'm gonna head into town later. Maybe get a bite to eat. Oh, yeah? You're welcome to join. Oh, just the two of us? Yeah. I guess. I'm sorry, Beau, but I- I'm happy to work together, but... Okay, so it'd be partly a working dinner. We could eat at the restaurant owned by the caterer. Oh, the Home Tavern? I'm doing the rehearsal dinner there. All the more reason for us to taste test the cuisine. You like how thorough I'm being with our wedding responsibilities? I appreciate your going above and beyond, but I don't wanna complicate things. Yeah. Okay, no problem. No worries. So, okay. So what's next on the list? Well, you know, all the wreaths that we brought in yesterday? How could I forget? Thought we could spruce them up a bit. I put the wedding party to work. I had them take them all down to the Snowflake Room, and I thought we could have a wreath-making party. The Snowflake Room? I thought our friendly concierge said that was off-limits? How'd you'd swing that? Sometimes people just need an invitation to open themselves up to some Christmas miracles. Joan, could I get going on this thing? I saw the decorations laid out on the table. I absolutely love wreath making. Thank you, Charlie, for opening up the Snowflake Room. Always happy to help. Who knew? Hmm! Shall we? Yeah-Um- You know what? Actually, I'll be right with you. I just have to make a stop first. Wow. How's everyone doing? Ah! I'm so excited! I haven't decorated a wreath in years. Aw. Liam's not here yet? I think he's still working on his vows. He probably just lost track of time. Mrs. Stinson? I haven't really done anything like this since middle school art class. Back then my teacher thought my painting of Santa looked more like the Kool-Aid Man. I have faith in you, Tommy. And just remember, there's no one right way to do this. How's this, Joan? Wow, incredible. Well, this obviously isn't your first time. Actually, it is. I've scheduled these kinds of events for years, but this is the first time that anyone has ever invited me to participate. Would you mind covering for me for a second? I'm just gonna run out and check on our groom. Absolutely. Don't worry about a thing. Okay, everyone, who needs help with their glue gun? I do. Hey, by the way, how those vows going? They are... They're going. Listen, I don't know how helpful I'd be, but if you need some feedback, I could take a look. - Really? - Hello, gentlemen. Hey, Mom. How's the wreath making going? You know, everyone's having a good time. Really? Well, then, we should probably head in there, huh? Yeah. Liam, can we just chat for a second? - Sure. - Yeah. I should probably get a head start on my wreath, anyway. I feel I'm gonna need some extra time. Beau. Thanks. Yeah, man. About this morning. Mom. It's okay. No, I was a little thrown, that's all. I meant what I said yesterday. I'm really glad you're trusting your gut. Thanks, Mom. I had a really great phone interview earlier. My commute would only be five minutes. That's great. Congratulations. Thanks. You and Beau had a nice talk? Yeah. Yeah, he seems like a nice guy. Apologized for this morning. - Really? - Mm-hmm. Well, he asked me to dinner as a peace offering too. Oh, that's great. Yeah. I said no. Why? Well, I don't want him to get the wrong idea. Wrong idea about what? You gotta eat? He did call it a working dinner. He wanted to try out the food at the restaurant owned by the caterer. What's wrong with that? Mom, go have fun. alright? I don't want this week to be all work for you. It's Christmas. No, it's okay, honey. This wedding planning thing's actually really fun. I woke up this morning and practically jumped out of bed. Ah, it's because you're a natural. Well, it's sweet of you to say. I'm not trying to be sweet. It's the truth. Mom, you do everything for everyone. When's it gonna be your turn to have a little bit of fun? Oh, hey. Hi. If the opportunity is still open, I would love to join for that working dinner tonight. Well, you know, technically, I did say it'd be partly a working dinner. Right. Partly working dinner. Yeah, but the thing is I already made a reservation for one. I guess I could check with the restaurant. Yeah, you do that then. Is that your work? Yeah. It's part of a new collection I'm working on. It's winter scenes. Starting on a shoot in Finland and then I started pulling all these old photos from over the years. Thought it might be cool if I put them all together. Winter or Christmas? A bit of both, I guess. Yeah. I think we're making progress here. You know, some of these are perfect candidates for ornaments to hang on the tree. Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna have time to hang any ornaments. There's always time for ornaments. Not when you're taking the photos. Even then. Oh, speaking of that, I was working on the schedule. Wanted to know how much time you wanted for the posed photos of her wedding party? You know, I'm not a big fan of traditional posed wedding photos. I should have seen that one coming. No, look, it's just unexpected candids are so much better. Then how do you get the perfect wedding picture? By catching people in real moments. You can't get more perfect than that. Look, do you recommend using fake flowers to your customers? No, of course not. Well, why? Perfect color. They're always in bloom. They'll never wilt. Yeah. You have a point. I mean, real flowers are more beautiful because of their imperfections. It's the same with my photos. I can see that. But I am the mother of the groom and I do want some posed photos. Okay. Okay. I guess about half an hour. Half hour it is. - Till then. - Okay. Hey um... What made you change your mind? Change my mind? About dinner. I decided I deserve a little fun. I'm glad you did. So should we take your car or maybe a luxurious florist van instead? Actually, I had somebody else in mind. Are you serious? Yeah. Come on. Where's your Christmas spirit? By the way, you look amazing. Thank you. Thank you. Grinch, huh? That was really beautiful. Thank you. Is that how you always try to apologize? Oh, no. Actually, I don't have that much practice. Thank you. Okay. I gotta ask. You never settled down? Jumping right in? No. I did not. Just never got around to it. Interesting. Suspicious, but interesting. What about you? Have you dated much since Morgan passed away? Oh, I had a relationship, but it didn't work out. Why do you suppose that is? You know, the idea of introducing a new man into Liam's life, when I wasn't sure if it would work out, just didn't feel right. He was a nice guy, but he wanted more than I could give at that time. Yeah. I get that. I was given one great true love and I've accepted that. All right, I went. What about you? Well, I did have one serious girlfriend. - That's about it. - That's about it? Come on, you gotta give me more than that. There's not more to give. We just weren't a match. What? did she like Christmas too much or what? Exactly? How'd you guess? She just... She wanted more than I was able to give at the time. Fair enough. So how come you don't usually spend Christmas with family? How'd you know that? Just a hunch. Well, my brother, he lives a life that's so different from mine. You know, great wife, amazing daughter, roots in a small town. As I got older it... You saw the appeal? It's just a lot easier to forget what you're missing when it's out of sight. I started avoiding going home. Focus more on what I'd set out to do instead. And then, you know, one year becomes five and so on. And yet, here you are. Yeah, well, maybe I'm switching things up. Hmm. I highly recommend it, by the way. - Switching things up? - Yeah. I mean, you were clearly born to plan weddings. Katie told me you were gonna start your own business. So why not take the leap? Oh, it's not really the right time now. Now Liam and Katie are staying here now and I just wanna be around to help them if they need it. Mm-hmm. And? And? Come on, you don't think there's some fear in there too? Why would you say that? 'Cause it's scary to take a jump. Yeah, it can be. Come on, isn't that what you admire about what Liam's doing? He's following his heart, even though everything's not fully lined up yet. Yeah. Change is hard. That's true. It's true. Spontaneity does not come as easily these days. You mean the spontaneity like spending the whole day with a total stranger when you're 18? Precisely. Well, you said that in your life, there are no two days the same. Yeah. And you know what? After a while, even that becomes predictable. Maybe we need to get back in touch with our spontaneity. Back in touch with who we were as those 18-year-olds. Care to dance? There's no one on the dance floor yet. Come on, number four. Let's be number one. Okay. You're every bit as beautiful as the day we met. I have a very extensive skin care routine. No, it's not that. It's just you. You know, I always wondered about you. - Really? - Yeah. I don't know if you've had enough Christmas yet, but I have an idea. Are you okay? Oh, yeah. I just haven't been on one of these in a long time. The Joan I knew wasn't afraid of heights. Thought the Beau I knew was. Yeah, you help me get over it. Ah, there she is. The fearless girl with the perfect smile. Come on. Okay. Guess spontaneity suits me. It definitely does. So, I should tell you, I never stopped wondering what happened to you either. You should know, I really wanted to be there that night. I don't know if you remem... Do you need to get that? It's my editor. Oh, wait. Weren't you trying to reach him? It's fine. Look, anyway. So what happened was... Go ahead. It might be important. Let me just text them really quickly so he leaves me alone. Okay. Hey, Liam? Liam! Do you wanna know how I met your mom? We met by the tree at the Snowfall Lodge. That's where we fell in love. In love? That was the night we met. We didn't even start dating till the fall. Oh, I knew before you even told me your name. It was love at first sight. I made a wish that night, right before the tree lit up to meet you. - You hear that, Liam. - Yeah. Yeah. I knew right before I met you, you're always gonna be the one for me. And you're the only one more me. I'm sorry about that. No, we should probably get back. Why? It's still early. Yeah, I have a lot to do tomorrow and probably should get a good night's sleep. I told Katie that we'd show her the Holly Room in the afternoon too, so. Yeah, you're right. We should probably call it night. Okay, are you ready to see it? I can't wait. I'm so excited. All right. One, two, three. It's perfect. It's everything I've ever dreamed of. Oh Katie, I'm so glad. We're just so lucky. You've been so supportive of us from the very beginning. I'm just really happy for you both. A lot of parents would have said we were too young, but you trusted us. That meant so much. Yeah, well, it's obvious how in love you two are. When your heart knows, why wait? Exactly. This idea that love only finds you at a certain age, never made sense to me. How can you put a timeline on love? You can't. Love finds you when it's supposed to. So what does the bride think? I love it! My parents are gonna be so impressed when they get in tomorrow. You and Joan turned out to be a great team. Yeah, we really are. Gram, Gramps, we're so happy you're here. So are we. It's been years since we've mentioned the Snowfall Lodge. The place hasn't changed at all. To be here for your wedding on Christmas Eve is so special for us. Only two days away. I'm so excited. Mom, Dad, you made it! - Hi. I'm Beau. - Pleased to meet, Beau. Nice to meet you too. - After you. - Thank you. Good evening. May I get you anything to drink? Oh, yeah. I would love some hot chocolate, please. I'll take one too. Two hot chocolates. With three marshmallows a piece, please. That sounds perfect. Coming right up. Three marshmallows? Any more and it's too sweet. Any less and you wish you had more. Wow, Mom, you're really branching out. She usually doesn't go for marshmallows. Not since she was a little girl, anyway. Isn't that exactly how you used to order it, Joan? Yeah, I must've mentioned it to Beau. Yeah. Interesting. I hear the Holly Room looks stunning. Joan, could we sneak a little peak before your hot chocolate arrives? Sure, Mom. Joan, what did I always tell you? Moms can read minds. Exactly. So spill it. Okay. You're not gonna believe this. You may not even remember. But Beau is the same guy who stood me up at the Christmas tree lighting the night I met Morgan. Number five? Not so loud. Yes, number five. Oh, my goodness. And now you're reunited. Oh, it doesn't get much more romantic than that. No, it's not romantic. He's very nice. It was a long time ago. Joan... Listen, Beau and I agreed to keep this to ourselves. I need you to promise not to tell anyone. Fine, but... No. Promise me, Mom. Of course, you have my word. But I'm just saying when I look at the two of you, there's something in the air. There's nothing in the air. Completely clear skies. Oh, no. What happened here? Unexpected storm last night. Tree fell on the roof. Now we've got a leak, and we're having trouble with the heat and power in here. But someone's coming to fix it, though, right? We can try, but it's the day before Christmas Eve. Soonest anyone can get out of here as the 26th. The 26th? My niece is getting married tomorrow. Yeah, pretty sure Charlie's trying to find you guys to break the bad news. He's got some options for us, right? Liam and Katie are on their way to the airport to pick up her parents. We've got a couple hours to fix this. To fix this? Follow me. I've got an idea. So, what's your idea? Actually, it's your idea. - Hmm? - Mm-hmm. You know you said you didn't know how an event room could compete with the season's natural beauty? Yeah. Well, maybe you were right. We have everything we need right here. How do you mean? All right, the ceremony is only 20 minutes long. - Okay? - Okay. So what have we lined heaters over here and over here. Okay? Now, imagine the altar right there. Flowers all around. And the chairs here with blankets draped over them so that the guests can stay cozy. Katie wanted a winter wonderland. Why don't we give her one? So we add warm milk and we have instant hot chocolate. The guests are gonna love it. Hey, you two! I hope we're not interrupting anything. - Hey. - So good to see you! - And you. - Oh, my God. You look great! Yeah, good to see you. We were picking up Mum and Dad when we got your message about the Holly Room. I couldn't believe it. But after seeing what you did outside, I couldn't be happier. Yeah, honestly, it was a major upgrade. I feel terrible about this. But I have a spa appointment in five minutes. Oh, well, every bride needs a pre-wedding pampering. Don't worry. We've got this. You guys are the best. Enjoy. Beau, I was wondering if you had- able to look at that thing? Yeah, I did. Listen, I made a few notes, but you did such a great job. Thanks, man. Means a lot. So they're in my room. Want me to grab them? You know what? I'll just come by, swing by later, pick them up. Still got two more items on my own checklist. Uh-huh. Everyone, see you at the rehearsal dinner. Mom. You're good. We were just saying you should go catch up with your brother, it's been so long. - You sure? - Absolutely. - All right. - Yeah. I'm so glad I can finally help. It was killing us being stuck in Vermont. Yeah, seriously. Thank you both for being here for Katie when we couldn't. It was truly our pleasure. It was. Shall we? Yeah. Yeah. It's good to see. - Okay - Right. Let's get started. Put your purse down here. Come, grab one of these. So, Nepal? Yeah, you gotta see these Sherpas. They're unbelievable. These guys they're carrying like three times their weight up the mountain, it's unbelievable. All right, well, you know, it is so great to hear about how you doing so well, but now I gotta ask. You and Joan? Huh? What's that look? Oh, you know exactly what that look is. Yeah, I do. It's the look of someone who has no idea what he's talking about. Okay. Maybe I'm wrong. But I could've sworn I saw a spark between you two. I think maybe that was just your jet lag. Maybe. You know what? This is so great. Yeah. It's so rare that we get to see each other. Having you here, is a real treat. Yeah, about that. Listen, I'm sorry, I haven't been around so much. And I wanna try to change that. Oh, hold on a second. Is everything okay? Yeah. It's just, it's my editor, about my next assignment. I Uh.. I Actually thought I was gonna get some time off, but he says it starts day after Christmas. Oh, wow. Well, where this time? Alaska. I don't wanna miss anything. If I go it's gonna be on Christmas Day. If? Beau, you don't have to feel guilt. Look, we all know what your job entails. And you look, you've already done so much. And whenever you have to leave, we'll all understand. Thanks. Excuse me a second. - Cheers. - Cheers. You really went above and beyond for those kids. There is no way the original planner could have done anything so special. Thanks, Beau. Appreciate that. Can I show you something? Yeah, of course. Wow. What? You're gonna do it? I am. You are gonna take the wedding world by storm. I can see it now. Thanks for encouraging me to take a risk. I just gave you a little push. I'm really excited about this next chapter of my life. Actually, you've got me thinking about mine too. - Yeah? - Yeah. I'm starting to think I might be getting tired of traveling all the time. I'm actually thinking about staying right here in the area. And that way it'd be close to Katie, Liam, and then, you know, you. Wow. What about your photography? How will that fit into the plan? Okay, so I've been thinking about that. Something you said. I don't have to go to all these far off places to pursue my passion. Really? I mean, there's as many beautiful, candid, day-to-day moments here as there are abroad. Yeah. I couldn't agree more. So in fact, I'm thinking about publishing a new collection of photos. Of what? Something that's been missing from my portfolio. Moments between families. I love that idea. I don't know, I guess I was so focused on the path that I've been on, I forgot to look up and see the beauty that was right in front of me. This week I looked up. Well, the truth is I am kind of like the idea of you being around here more. - Good. - Yeah. Beau? Sorry. Hi. - This looks amazing. - Thank you. You've outdone yourself, Joan. I'm so glad you and Beau have gotten to know each other. I knew you two would hit it off. It's been really nice. He's a great guy. Oh, it's too bad that his next assignment starts the day after Christmas. His next assignment? Peter said Alaska. I really wish we could have gotten here sooner. We were really hoping to spend more time with him. Yeah, I thought he might be here a bit longer. Did he tell you that? He always has the best of intentions, but a job always pops up. We're used to it and we love him anyway. Guess as much as we wish otherwise, some people never change. No, I made up my mind. I'm not taking this job. Look, I gotta run. What? No. No, I'm not saying this is a negotiation tactic. Listen, I'll talk to you later. Hey, Eddie. Merry Christmas. Hey, Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan. That's Sarah and Peter, Liam. Right. Of course. Do you mind if I talk to my mom for a second? Oh, yeah. Not at all. Sarah, we should go and build our gingerbread house. - Yes, we should. - Yes. I spotted some candy canes that would make beautiful French doors. Oh, mais oui. Mom, I gotta ask you something? Yeah. What is it, honey? Did you... Did you know Beau before this week? No. I mean kind of. Kind of? Barely. We met once. How did you know? Doesn't matter. Why didn't you tell me? I didn't tell you because there was so much else going on this week it just didn't seem important. The fact that you knew my fiance's uncle when you guys were younger, seems kind of important to me. It was a million years ago. How do you know him? We met here. Same night I met your father. You guys like dated? No, honey. It was never romantic between me and Beau. It was just a silly day, many years ago, and it meant nothing, I promise. Okay. Okay. Well, what about now? You guys have to spend a lot of time together? As friends. That's it. Listen, I believe that people get one shot at love. And for me, that love was your dad. We had a beautiful life together and I miss him every day. I miss him too, Mom. There was nothing between me and Beau and there never will be, okay? Okay. So, I got a call from my editor. He offered me an assignment. Starts the day after Christmas in Alaska. That's fantastic. Is it? Isn't it? Yeah, I suppose so. Did you know about the offer before you told me you were considering staying? - Yeah. - I think you should take it. Especially if you're already committed to it. I mean, you don't wanna tell someone you're gonna do something and then go back on your word. Yeah, no one likes it when someone says one thing, but it means something else. And there he is. You should answer that. It looks like things are wrapping up. I'm gonna head out. What time you wanna meet tomorrow? No, I think everything's already ready. So I'll see you at the wedding. Hey, Eddie. What's up? Liam and Katie have each prepared their own set of vows. Katie? Liam. That night of the Christmas party, you were talking to my friends and me, making us laugh, as you always do. And I looked up, and I knew in that moment you were the love of my life. That night you asked me if I believe in Christmas miracles? And, as I stand here, with you right now, I can say that I most definitely do. Katie. They say that the sign of a good relationship is that both people are getting the better end of the deal. But, I can say in my case, with 100% certainty, that I did. You taught me that it's about where you put down roots but who you put them down with. I fell in love with you the moment I met you. I can't wait to spend the rest of our lives together. I now pronounce you husband and wife. Liam, you may kiss the bride. Aren't they sweet together? They really are. Is everything okay? I was going to ask you the same. Me? Oh, I'm wonderful. This is one of the best days of my life. I've noticed you and Beau have barely said a word to each other all day. Oh, that. Mom. I've already told you there's nothing going on with me and Beau. Joan, I can tell there is. Why are you holding back? Because of Liam? He would want you to be happy. Yeah. Not if he knew the full truth. Mom, how am I supposed to tell Liam that I did have love at first sight, the day I met his dad, but not with Morgan with Beau. We were just coming to grab you for some photos. Yeah, I don't think it's a good time for that. Joan. It's really not a good time for this either. Honey, I am so sorry. I love you so much, and I just didn't wanna ruin the story you had of your father and me. It's okay, Mom. I just wish you would have told me the truth because there's nothing you could ever tell me that would ruin the love story that you and Dad shared. Overhearing that doesn't change anything for me. You're right. I should have just told you. I just want you to be happy. So would Dad. I do have feelings for Beau, but it was clear that it wasn't meant to be from the start. We were supposed to meet at the tree lighting the night I met your dad, but Beau never showed. And well, now, he's off to his next assignment in Alaska. So fate is intervening once again. I'm sorry, Mom. It's okay. Let's go celebrate you and Katie. Did you ever figure out why he didn't show? No. It's funny he would hold on to a picture of you for all those years. He did? Yeah. I saw up in his room. Thank you everyone for joining Liam and Katie on this special day. One thing they share is that they both believe in the value of family. So I'd like to thank our family, Joan, and Beau, especially, for putting together this beautiful wedding. And when we were kids, we spent a Christmas in this town, and well on Christmas Eve, I begged my big brother Beau to go and take me to see Santa. Well, he had plans already, probably with a girl, but well, regardless, he agreed to take me beforehand. Well, when we arrived, I caught a glimpse of Santa and I got so excited that I let go of Beau's hand and I ran out into the street. Well, the next thing I know, we both woke up in the hospital. A car at been coming right me and Beau, he just ran out in the street and he saved my life. Beau, if you hadn't been there for me I wouldn't have gotten the chance to walk my daughter down the aisle today. So thank you for making today possible. Liam, Katie, may every day together just be better than the last. Cheers. Everyone, cheers. Hey, everyone. Grab your ornaments. We're all gonna head down to the tree lighting soon. Yeah, do it. Congratulations. This has been the best day of my life. Thank you, Joan. So, Mom, got your ornament? You know, in the midst of everything, I forgot to make one. But I will find one. Have you guys seen Beau? I did. Joan. I have already had three inquiries from guests staying here. We would love to have you coordinate some more weddings here at Snowfall Lodge. I would love that. Thank you. Hi, there. You're here. I couldn't find you anywhere. I thought you'd left. I could never have left without saying goodbye to you. Beau, about what you're brother said, I had no idea. I turned down the assignment. You're not going to Alaska? No. Gonna try something risky and stick around Colorado. I spent months in that hospital, and when I finally got out I started going through life not wanting to waste a single moment. Didn't leave me time for love. I don't know, maybe I didn't make time. What about now? No, I don't wanna waste another moment without you. Last call to hang ornaments on the tree! Time to make those wishes! I didn't get a chance to make an ornament. Oh, you didn't have to. Printed this for you. It's the perfect wedding picture I wanted. Thank you. Did you make an ornament? Yeah. Can't believe you still have this after all these years. I can't believe you made an ornament. I made two, actually. Seems like proof of Christmas miracles. Hmm. You think so? Must've made a pretty hefty wish. Think it'll come true? Guess we'll just have to wait and see. You know, it's Christmas tomorrow. I already have everything I want.
