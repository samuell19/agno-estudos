And the right side of the meridian is called the Eastern hemisphere. Today we are going to learn how to create a text box. Use the text box tool to start writing the first paragraph of the essay. Make sure you put your name and the date at the top. Edward Middle School. Hi Ms. Annie, I'm sorry, but the principle stepped out of the office. Can I have him call you back? Thank you, bye bye. This is Mr. Barnaby your principle here at Edward Middle School. I have a special announcement for you. I don't know how to make this stop! Josh, I think you left this here. Josh, why would you do this? To celebrate Cinco De Mayo. Very funny. That was three weeks ago, and you don't even like that type of music. I can see here Josh that you're a bright student, except in history. And you're very strong in technology, except you're not doing anything with those talents. You're just wasting it on doing pranks. This is third time this year that you've tried to pull your little technology pranks. I'm going to have to call your father. Let's see what he has to say about this. Oh yes sir, I am planning to go in person to Michigan this Friday to see if he'll sign the deal. Well, with that kind of a bonus sir, I'm gonna do everything I can to make sure he agrees to it. Sorry sir, it looks like it's the principal of my sons school calling. Can I call you back? Sure. Alright. Vargas, go. Hello Mr. Vargas, this is Principle Barnaby. We have a little problem. We need to talk about Josh. Do you know how embarrassing it is to get a call from your principle? Since when did you care about what I do in school? All you care about is not looking bad. Watch your mouth Josh! Listen, that's what you think, but I need to be able to concentrate on doing my work. I can't be getting calls from your principle telling me about your little spy pranks. And besides that, he tells me that you're currently failing history? What do you have to say for yourself? What? I got an F, big deal. That is a big deal. And what about your little spy prank? What are you going to do with him? Okay, here's what's going to happen. First of all Joshua, no video games for two weeks. Mom! And, if you do not ace your history presentation, you will not have video games for the whole summer. And I'll take away all your little spy toys for the whole summer too. That's not fair! And playing disrespectful pranks on your principle is fair? That's final. Okay, it wasn't me. Well, since you're here now Jessy, this Friday I have a business meeting in a small town in Michigan, just a few hours away from here. But I figure since you have a long weekend, we can all go out together on Thursday and come back on Friday. - Dad! - Awe Dad! Come on buys, you're always complaining that I'm always too busy. This is a time that we can go and do something together. Dad, that usually means doing something fun. You heard your father, we are going with him. The country? Aren't there animals and bugs? And where are we gonna stay? Well, there's no hotels in this town, but I did find a nice vacation rental that we can rent for the night. A town with no hotels! That's my worst nightmare! Is everyone ready! And this one. Hun, we're just going for one day. True, I forgot a few more things. We need to be ready for anything. Two weeks of anything. Are you sure about this place you're renting? Hun, there is nothing else in this town. Don't worry, it looked great. In the pictures. That's what I'm worried about. Anyone can use Photoshop nowadays. Okay everyone, settle down. We'll know in a moment, we're almost there. Dad, I thought you said we were almost there? I'm not gonna be happy if a lion jumps out all of a sudden. That would be cool. Not bad dad. Way to go Pops. Are you sure you got the right address? I'm slightly impressed, but there is a lot of creatures in here. What happened? I think there was a squirrel. What? What's the matter? Dad, there's no signal here. There's not even wifi. Come on guys, it's like an adventure. We don't like adventure. Come on hun, this is a nice place. There's no critters in here. Well, we'll see. What? Stop tickling my feet. Hun, I'm not in bed yet. Mr. Thomas, when you bought the store we assumed you would run the store a little differently. We're hearing reports about some unusual practices here. As you know, we sent you an email last week. Our investors are a little bit worried, and basically, we either need you to pay back the loan, or you need to return the store to us. I can't pay back the loan Mr. Vargas. I don't have that kind of money just lying around. We are prepared to make you an offer. If you cooperate and sign the store over to us, we are prepared to offer you this check. That way you can get a little bit of money that you can walk away with and we can avoid a nasty legal mess. Mr. Vargas, thank you. But I believe the store is doing just fine. Mr. Thomas, I hear you closed the store on the busiest day of the week. And you even give things away. This is not good business. Look, I'm just trying to be a good manager. A good manager? Yes a good manager. It's called being a good steward. Steward? Like Martha Steward? Like the Steward of Gondor? No. The biblical guidelines on how to best manage your life. Especially the most important things. That's all very nice, but I'm not convinced that you are a good manager. And the store needs to be run like a business. I urge you to take this offer before I walk out that door. Mr. Vargas, I cannot accept your offer, but I'll tell you what. It's a long weekend coming up, maybe if you can stay til Monday, three o'clock. Look at how I run my store. And if you're not convinced, I will sign over the store to you without a fight. However, if I can change your mind, then I want you to go back to your investors and let them know there's nothing to worry about here. What do you think? Are you insane? I'm not staying here all weekend. Forget it, we'll see you in court. He wanted us to stay here for four days? Is he crazy? That's what I told him. Besides, I didn't bring enough clothes for four days. Four days without internet? Come on dad, you're killing my social life. I'm not gonna have any friends by the time I get back. Yeah dad, this place is boring. I don't need your opinion. Besides, if you were smart, you'd be worried about acing your history report. Hun, maybe it's just worth staying here for a few days. I thought you, I thought you didn't like it here? Maybe if we can stay here until Monday we can close the deal and get your bonus. Plus, you can spend some time helping Josh in his history project. A hardware store? Really dad? Could there be a more boring place? Come on Josh, maybe there's wifi here. I don't care about wifi. How could you? Alright guys, I have to go up and see Mr. Thomas. Stay out of trouble. That's my specialty. No. I'm glad you changed your mind Mr. Vargas. Please, just call me Tony. And the only thing that I've agreed to is to stay here til Monday. Nothing in my mind has changed about what I see going on here. Fair enough. I only ask for one other thing. You see, I really want you to understand what I mean about being a good steward. It's not just something that we do at a store. It's a way of living your life. You see, I've chosen to manage the details of my life God's way. While most people choose to do that their own way or the way society says they should. So, what are you saying? So I want you to compare the common way of managing your life and God's way of managing it. And then Monday at three p.m. You can decide for yourself how I run this store. Okay, fine. I'll go along with this. Just to make sure you fully understand some things, I might ask you to do some special tasks. Don't worry, it's nothing wild or illegal. And if you do, I'll sign the papers over to the investment company quick and painless. What exactly do you have in mind? Hey, what are you doing? What am I doing or what am I supposed to be doing? I guess they're not the same thing. I'm supposed to be working on my history project. Ooh, sorry. We finished school last week. Lucky. So what are those? I'm making my own pair of night vision goggles using this modified virtual reality headset. Well that's a mouth full. Well, I'm Cam and this is Faith. My mom works here in the store. And my Uncle James owns the store. I'm Josh, I'm stuck here for a few days because my dad has some meetings or something. And that's my brother Jessy. What's he doing? He's just trying to save his social life from being flushed down the toilet. So Josh, that's going to be an aphotic optical device? Night vision goggles. Yeah. What is that? It means you can supposedly see in the dark with those. Not supposedly, it will see in the dark. You want to test it in the store basement? It's dark down there. It's very dark down there. You think we could? Indubitably! Come on. Did you hear me? I said it's very dark down there. Did I mention it's a little scary down there? I believe you may have mentioned it. I don't like coming down here. But Cam's not scared. Wow. This building is old. Yeah, Mr. Thomas said the original part was built in 1912. Are you ready for delumination? Delumination? To turn off the lights. Oh yeah, just wait a second. Does he always talk like that? That's affirmative. Okay, turn off the lights. I don't like the dark, Cam. Come on Faith, try not to be scared. Well Josh, are they operational? Yeah! Cool! Can I look? Maybe I'll be less scared. Sure. Cool! These are neat! Can I see? You don't need them Cam, you're not afraid of the dark. I just wanna see how they work. They work just fine. Come on Faith. Oh, okay. Here. Whoa, these are pretty cool! How does he get anything done around here? He's been with that guy for 15 minutes! And, there's a dog walking around in the store, nice. Those are cool. What are you gonna do with them? I don't know, spying. There is not much of a populace for espionage. There's not much to spy here. Don't remind me. Hey what's that over there? Oh, that's the part of the basement that... Dark. We don't go there. I was gonna say tenebrous. But yeah, the light over there doesn't work. Lets check it out with these! You want to go back there? Yeah, come on! Hey, did you know there's hole in the wall here? A hole? Really? We never saw that before. I wish this place had lights back here. I have a flashlight if you want. Why didn't you say so! You never asked! Cool flashlight. That's pretty, effulgent. Hold on guys, I'm gonna be blind for a couple of seconds here. You go on without me. Come on, let's go in. You know, I think my mom is calling me. Come on Faith! Wow, this place is way too cool. I never knew this place existed. I wish I never knew this place existed. Hold on, let me see this. What is this? Maybe it's a secret treasure map! Don't be silly Faith. It's just an old piece of paper. Look, it's addressed to a place in Arizona. Maybe it's a spy document. Maybe it's a secret letter from the President! Maybe it's a "do not enter" sign that somebody forgot to put up. What does it say? "Dear sir, thank you for your help. "Per our agreement, you must now..." "You must now destroy all documents "that refer to 'the door' "in order to keep the location secret." A secret door? In Arizona? Look, it's dated 1958. Whoa! Cool! That thing is ancient. Maybe it's an important document. Maybe we should return it to the original owner? Are you serious? It looks like trash, but I wonder what it means? A secret door? Maybe we should give it back to the person who put it there. Dude, you guys are crazy. That's been sitting for about 50 years. No one's missing it. Besides, helping someone you don't even know, that's just whack. Well, my dad says you should help others before you help yourself. Helping someone that you don't even know exists? That just doesn't make sense. But then again, it is a mysterious note. And since I'm bored out of my mind, I guess I'll help you. Cool. Well your spy stuff already helped us find this paper. I have an idea. Let's show this to my Uncle James, maybe he'll know something about it. Hey guys, who's your friend? This is one of my boys. Josh this is Mr. Thomas, he's the owner of the store. Hi. Uncle James, we found this paper in the basement. Yeah, it's superannuated from 1958. It mentions a man named Jack Hawkins. You know anything about him? Superannuated? Yeah. If I'm not mistaken, Jack Hawkins used to own this store a long time ago. But that's a neat piece of store history though. Do you think it's important? Yeah, do you think we should return it to him? Oh no, I wouldn't worry about that, although it is a bit of a historical mystery! Okay, thanks. James, I was watching you earlier. I believe in customer service but you're spending way too much time with your customers. You spent like 20 minutes with this one guy. Maybe. He had some big questions. He's working on a project. But Tony, I think you forget something. Remember, this store is not just about making money, it's about serving my community and connecting with them. Well, your investors believe the purpose of this store to make money. I do well in my business because I focus on making money, like a business should. I'm sure you're a good businessman, and you're right, I probably don't spend enough time focusing on making money. Which is why I'm stuck here. Which reminds me, as part of our agreement, I mentioned to you that while you're here I might ask you to do a few tasks. That's true, I agreed to that. What are you gonna make me do? Are you going to make me sweep the floor? Nothing of the sort. I want you to make a list. A list of what? A list of things you're thankful for. I gotta run now for a few minutes, but you can work on that. Are you serious? This is ridiculous. I wish this note had more information. Maybe it does, maybe it's written in code! Or with invisible ink! What? What did I say? They used a lot of invisible ink in the 1950's. Maybe there's invisible ink on this note. Okay, take it easy. I like this spy playing a lot, but I think you're taking this a little bit too seriously. What if there is something? How could we read it? With this. This is an ultraviolet light. Do you always walk around with all this paraphernalia? Mm hm. Nothing. Good try. It would've been really cool. Can I see that? Uh, guys, what's this? Alrighty, here you go, one list. Oh, that's not for me, that's for you. What do you mean it's for me? What are you talking about? Actually, it's for your family. You see, the second part of this task is for you to share that list with your family over supper tonight. You're kidding, right? No, not at all. They're going to think I've gone off the deep end. Supper at six at home. No I'm not kidding. They're gonna think I've flipped. I got one bar! I got a message from Dad? Alright, I sent the message. I just hope they get my text because there's not much signal around here. Where you guys staying? It's a rental over on Garrenridge Road. Oh yeah, not much signal in some parts. Well, look at us sitting around the table. This is interesting! This is weird. What's going on dad? Well, there's something I need to tell you guys. Please tell me the man accepted your offer and we are going home tomorrow. No, no, no, nothing like that. You're getting me a car? You're sending Jessy to boarding school in Alaska? No guys. I kind of agreed to do a couple of things while I'm here observing. And this is Mr. Thomas's idea by the way. Dad, you're getting really weird. Well, today I wrote a list of things I'm thankful for and I need to share them with you. This should be interesting. We should do supper more often, this is better watching TV! Well, I probably don't say this very much guys, but the one thing that I'm most thankful for is you guys. Mom, I think dad has malaria or something. Well, thanks for coming out and checking up on us. Oh not a problem. You guys are guests in this town. I just wanted to stop by and see if needed anything. Listen, thanks for suggesting that task today. You know, the list. How'd it go? Actually, we had a nice time together. It was a kinda awkward, mostly for me. But I still don't know what you're getting at. Well Tony, I also stopped by to tell you something else. The store is closed tomorrow, so you don't have to go hang out there tomorrow morning. Right, you close on the busiest day. Yes, well, we'll be at church tomorrow morning, of course you are welcome to join is if you like. And, I also wanted to invite you and your family at three tomorrow for a little outing. So is this one of your required tasks? No, but I'd really like it if you and your family came. I think you'd have fun. Just meet me at the store at three if you decide to come. Well, have a good night Tony. This is crazy. Dad, did you really mean all that stuff you said at supper? Of course I did Josh. Listen, I probably don't say this enough, or ever, but you guys really do mean a lot to me. And you know what, I'm gonna get better at showing that okay. Hey you know what? Mr. Thomas invited us to go with him tomorrow at three p.m. to go do something with him. I'm not sure what he has in mind, but it sounds kind of mysterious. Do you wanna go? Yeah! Is Mr. Thomas still making you do weird things? I don't know, we'll see. Why don't you get some sleep now okay? Okay. Dad? Yeah. Do you think you'd have some time this weekend to help me on my history project? That sounds like a great idea. What part of history do you need to do your report about? Anything in the 1900's. I was thinking about doing something about spies. That sounds pretty cool. Why don't we plan on working on that together this weekend. Awesome, thanks Dad. Josh, I think I don't spend enough time with you. And if it's okay, I think it'd be great if we could maybe do more stuff together. That would be great Dad. Tony, I get the impression something is on on your mind this morning? Well, I had a talk with Josh last night and, I don't know, I'm just wondering if I'm being a good Dad. I mean, I'm at work all the time, and my kids are getting in trouble. Then it hit me, am I being a good dad? I mean, that's also part of my job. What did you tell him? Well, I told him he gets in trouble because he doesn't use his time and his energy to do good things, and then it hit me, what about me? Do I use my time and energy to guide the boys? To spend time with you guys? I felt awful. James, those were really beautiful flowers. Yes, they were gorgeous. Yup, they arrived yesterday. I thought Mrs, Henderson could use them. You know, her husband died a couple months ago? Wait a second, so that lady didn't pay you for those flowers? So you're taking your best flower pots and giving them away? No wonder your business is failing. You close on the busiest day, you give stuff away! It's true, you're gonna go bankrupt! Tony! That's okay. As I told you yesterday, we love serving the people of this town. It's not just a job for us. We love being generous and I'm not talking about sharing what we have leftover. What do you mean "leftover?" If I give what I have leftover, or stuff I don't need anymore, am I really being generous? I'm trying to do that in all the areas of my life. With my time, my money, my store, my family. Tony, there's actually a word for that, being a good steward. Thanks for helping me out on history Dad. I'm glad I can help. I actually used to like history a lot when I was in school. Really? Yeah, sure. So, you're interested in spies huh? That's pretty cool. So how are we gonna track this man down in the letter? Step aside, and let the professionals through. First of all, we have no idea what those invisible ink numbers mean. I'm guessing they're important. But I got another idea. Oh yeah, there's no wifi around here. If you need wifi, I can turn it on in my Uncles office. Turn it on? Yeah, go turn it on. You have to turn on the wifi? Yeah, it's byzantine. You should get be getting a wifi signal right about now. Oh, oh I have wifi! Yes! Nice. I say we start with the company at the top of the letter. I bet this Hawkins man is going to be very happy to get his letter back about the secret door. Hmm, dead end guys. It looks like the company on the letter went out of business since 1979. 1979? That's prehistoric! Now what? Well, it looks like the man in this letter, Mr. Hawkins, died in 1989. But check this out. He was living in this town when he died. Not in Arizona? Hm? Uh oh. What? That's the look he gets when he thinks he has a great idea but it's usually not. Guys, the cemetery's just down the street, maybe we can find his grave. His grave? Really? Isn't that kind of creepy? What are you, timorous? Me? No. What's timorous? He's used that one on me before. He's saying you're chicken. I'll admit it, I'm chicken. No you're not Faith. Come on guys, spies need to follow clues no matter where they lead. Yeah, he's right. Come on Faith. How do I get dragged into these things? I'm timorous, remember? Well, I guess we're here. Are you sure we have to go in there? If we wanna find more clues about Mr. Hawkins, we have to go in there. Seriously? I thought you guys weren't scared. Well just do us a favor and watch where you're going. That wasn't me. It wasn't me either. Hey kids, can I help you with something? I just need my heart to get started again. It's just you Mr. Becker. We didn't see you. Sorry kids I startled you. Been doing a little bit of raking. Can I help you find something? We are looking for the grave of Jack Hawkins. Jack Hawkins. Let me think, where is he? I believe he's right over there. Go that direction. Wow, you're pretty good. Yeah. Well, thanks Mr. Becker. Certainly, have a great day. You too. Maybe we should split up and search. Great idea. Me and Cam are gonna go over there. I thought we were gonna split... I don't think this is a good idea. Yeah, I've been in more delightful places. Hey guys! I found it! Already? Yeah, there it is. Died on August two, 1989. Guys, look what it says back here. "Dad, I'll see you on resurrection morning. "Bill." You guys know what that means? That he was a Christian? No. I mean yes, but look, he has a son, Bill. Maybe he still lives in town. Come on, let's go! Yeah, let's go! Why do we have to run everywhere? Guys! Wait up! Uncle James! Uncle James! Do you know a guy named Bill Hawkins? Bill Hawkins? Hmm, I don't think I know anybody by that name. I'm assuming he's related to that guy in your mystery letter? Excuse me Mr. Thomas, Mrs. Heinz wants to know when the kangaroo closure's gonna arrive. Oh Mrs. Heinz? I need to speak with her. I'll be right back guys. Hey there Mrs. Heinz. Hi. Good news, your enclosure arrived this morning. Sorry for the delay. Awe, no worries mate. But I tell you what, it's hard to keep those little Joeys from jumping all over the furniture. Look, I'll go get it for you. Thanks heaps. Kangaroo enclosure? Well so much for that Bill Hawkins clue. Yeah, we hit a dead end. Hold on! We can look up his name in the phone book! Whoa, put that away. There's technology for that. Phone book, what's next? What's wrong with a phone book? Okay, there is one person in town with the last name Hawkins. But his name is William. Wait a second! The gravestone said Bill, and Bill is short for William! That's right! There isn't a phone number, but there's an address! Let's go! Why do we have to run everywhere? I'm tired? Hey, this is the neighborhood I was at yesterday. Helping a lady bring flowers. Really? You came to help someone? I thought you said helping a total stranger was whack? Yeah, I know. I'm glad you're helping us figure out this mystery. Let's go. I guess this is it. I guess there's nobody home. Maybe we should leave a note? I have a notebook and a pen. What do you not have in there? Spies need to be prepared for anything. Okay guys, this is what I got. "Hello Mr. Hawkins, we are Faith, Josh, and Cam. "We found an old letter in the basement "of the hardware store. "I think it has your dads name on it. "It talks about a secret door. "We think it's in Arizona. "We wanted to just return it to you. "We'll come back later." What do you guys think? I like it. I can't believe we're doing so much work to help somebody. Yoo hoo! Yoo hoo! Yes? Didn't you come here yesterday to bring my flowers? Yeah, that was me. I thought so. You have no idea how much pleasure those flowers have given me. Is there anything else I could do for you? Yes, my son in Oregon gave me this the other day. And he said we can see each other when we call, but I have no idea how to use this. Can you make it work for her Josh? I think I can do it. I'll be right back okay? Here you go kids. - Alright! - Awesome! Wow, thank you! Excuse me ma'am, do you know the man that lives across the street there? Oh yes, I have known him since he was a boy. Billy Hawkins. Well, he's not a little boy anymore, but he travels a lot for work now. And when he's gone he lives his dog Jack with me. Hey, I think I got it! Ma? Hello Justin! I can see you! Kids, come see grandma! Grandma! Ooh it's grandma! Hi! Josh, why did you help that lady? I knew you were gonna ask that. I don't know. Wow, you really made her day when you fixed it so she can see her family. Did you see the look on her face? Plus we got cookies! So, do you give stuff away all the time? No of course not. But I do when I think it's needed or if I think it's the right thing to do. I mean, yesterday was nice with the lady, but I don't know. I work hard for the stuff that I have. It's mine, I just don't see why I need to be giving it away. Besides, being generous seems to be getting you in trouble. Excuse me. Sir, are you a new employee here? No, no, no. I'm just here helping Mr. Thomas for a couple of days. But, is it okay if I ask you a question? Sure, what? Why do you shop here? I mean there's one of those big giant discount superstore lumberyards up just a few miles away with more variety and cheaper prices. Why do you come here? I just like coming to this store. Mom, that's not why you come here. You should tell him mom. Tell me what? It's not a big deal. Yes it is. It's a miracle. Last year my mom lost her job. These things happen, but things got pretty bad and a man even came and took her phone away. That was not cool. And then something else happened. Like the worst thing you could possibly imagine. The plumbing in the basement broke. There was water gushing out everywhere. We cleaned up the water and a plumber came, but he told us it would cost like $400 to fix. We came here to see how much the materials would cost and it was 200 bucks. Which we still didn't have. The next you know, Mr. Thomas tells my mom he wants to give us the plumbing materials. Can you believe that? Who gives people plumbing materials? Plus, he closed his shop for like two hours just to come and help us fix the problem. Isn't that crazy? Crazy's not a nice thing to say sweetie. But Mr. Thomas is a kind and generous man. I try to do as much shopping as I can here because I like the way he runs his store. Plus, I told all my friends to come and shop here. Do you know how rare it is to find a store like this nowadays? Well, who knows when Mr. Hawkins is coming back. I wish we knew more about the secret door in Arizona. Yeah. Plus, I'm gonna be leaving tomorrow. I don't think we're gonna be able to solve the mystery by tomorrow. I wish the letter said more about the secret door. That's the whole point silly. It's a secret door. Don't worry Josh, we had fun with you being spies. Can you show me what other cool stuff you have in your backpack? You like my spy gear? This is my ultraviolet light, you already saw that. This is my GPS, it connects with a satellite, and gives directions, type in your address or the coordinates. What? What is it? Hmm? Let me see the letter. Look at these numbers on the back. What if... What if what? What if these numbers are coordinates? Read the numbers off to me. Okay, here's the first set. 42.009300. Slowly. Four, got it? Two, got it? Faster. 42.009300. Is that good? Yes, thank you. Okay, 86.158 154. Is it in Arizona? No, these aren't coordinates. If they are, the door's in the middle of China. At least we tried. Well Mr. Green, looks like you've got quite a project going on here. Yeah, just repainting the kitchen at home. You know, I really don't know much about painting. But I hope I got enough stuff here. Well, if you manage your portions right,
