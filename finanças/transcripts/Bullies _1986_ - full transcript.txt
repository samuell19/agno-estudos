[rooster crows] [sheep baa] [television] [heavy breathing] [guitar] Wait till I those bastards in court. Fred, please. Woo, hoo! I think it was a lovely party. [burp] Damn chili. I'll make you a nice bromo when we get home. Isn't it lovely? Damn dust collector. Oh, Fred, don't be such a bear. I'm trying to drive, Martha. [scream] Fred. Ah! [crash] My god. They're trying to kill us. Ah! Ah! [crash] [screams] [crashing] Hey, man, take a look at all this. Now, is this local color or what? It's pretty exciting, Clay. Come on, Matt, you promised. Yeah, I know. I'll give it a chance. He was supposed to meet us here. Maybe everybody's taking a nap. Are you sure he said today? Yeah, that's what I told him. Oh look. I'll ask over there. Ah. Maybe he'll be over here. We'll find him. Hello? Hello? Anybody here? Hello? Help you, Mister? Yeah, I'm looking for Will Crow. Hey, don't mess around there. Nice car. What is it, a 351? It's a 289. I just waxed it. Can't race it, chrome it. Clay, I'm going to go take a look around. OK, don't take too long, man. Yeah, I'll try not get lost. So can you tell me where I can find this Will Crow character? Depends on what you want with him. Hi, I'm Clay Morris. You're taking over Fred and Martha's store. That's right. You'll do. Thanks. [sound of motorcycle engine] Hi. Nice bike. Sure ain't civilization. Seems kind of dead around here now, but come November when the ski lodge opens up, you'll be too busy. You folks ski? Oh, no, not really. Good, skiers are crazy. Shooting down a mountain on a couple of sticks of wood. Breaking their damn fool heads. Mr. Crow this is my wife, Jenny. How do you do, Mr. Crow? Fine. Could you please tell me where they kept the books? Back here. Look, I'd like to thank you for looking after my aunt and uncle's place till I could get up here. Fred and Martha were friends. Are you their only kin? Last of the line. Oh, that's just old Fred's security system. Is it loaded? Tend to work better that way. Well, we don't agree with guns. Why would they keep a loaded gun anyway? This place doesn't look like it has a high crime rate. I guess they had their reasons. Uh, your college is just about a mile east on the Old Trunk Road. You can't miss it. You folks need any help getting settled, just give me a holler. Thank you. You uh, you a hunter? Nope. They come with the truck. You must be the Morris kid. That's right. Name's Will Crow. You can call me Mr. Crow. I'm Matt. You can call me Mr. Morris. We're going to get along fine, Mr. Morris. Just don't be a smartass. Come on, Matt. Let's go see our new home. Matt's just getting settled. God, it's beautiful here. You know, though, if we just moved those mountains out of the way we'd have ourselves one hell of a view. Clay. It is beautiful. It's just so overwhelming. I mean, if you'd just talked with Tom Perkins, he would have given you position on staff. He always said you could do that. We both know I wasn't cut out for that job. Office politics just isn't in my blood. Look, Jen, I'm going to make you happy here, and Matt too. That's a promise. Give him time, honey. The divorce was rough on him. Rough on both of you. I'm older. I bounce back more easily. Well, I'm just glad you bounced in my direction. Come on. Let's go see the house. [laughing] [country music playing] You go out and have a good time, honey. I'll get this. You sure? Yeah. OK. [applause] Thank you. Now I'd like to have a great big grand welcome to our brand new neighbors, the Morris family. So are there any decent looking girl around here? Around here? Are you kidding? Unless maybe you count Becky Cullen. Oh, yeah? She here tonight? They don't let her out much. Why not? Boys seem to be getting along fine. Say, Murray, this man's glass is empty. Now, you know that's against town rules. New York was turning into such a bummer, you know? All our friends in the Village moved away, died, or became stockbrokers. Was it hard to adjust? No, no. I love the mountain. It's like um, so clean and open, you know? Isn't it sort of isolated? Not when the skiers hit town. All those young, muscular men walking around in tight ski pants, hey, here's to snow 365 days a year. Set them up, Murray. Bourbon. Drinking on duty, Sam? Hell, no. Make it a double. Hey, Jonah. I'm glad you could make it. Somebody forgot to invite me. This is our new neighbor, Jonah. Hi, Clay Morris. Jonah Cullen. I brought a welcoming gift. Made it from my own corn squeezing. Isn't that stuff illegal? Yeah, but what's a little illegal hooch between friends? [coughing] Who's that? You're looking at the richest man in Grant. Hey, Vern. Hi, Ben. Was a hell of a job you did on the four-by-four's transmission. Rig's running like a real charm. There's just one problem with this bill you gave me. Problem? It's too high. So, how do you like our little heaven on earth? I think maybe you better take another look at it. Think about it. We've got a new bowling alley. It's got six lanes, you know. Wow. It's really fun. Hi, Arnie. Hi, Sylvia. This is Matt. Hello. How you doing? You haven't asked me to dance. Well, I've been saving the best for last. Maggie, I want to dance. Got an early day tomorrow morning. I'll see you folks later. Don't work too hard, son. Damn, I got to say it. You are the prettiest looking thing to drop into this town in a long time. Thank you. Name's Ben Cullen. I'd like to welcome you properly with a dance. Well, um. Just a friendly dance. No harm in that. Sure, why not? Excuse me. What do you want? I want to dance with my wife. That ain't polite. It's OK, Clay. Hey, we got-- You are asking for it, Mister. Stop. Maybe you better dance with him, ma'am. Looks like he could use somebody to hold him up. [laughing] [ferocious barking] [crash] Matt? What happened, Matt? I don't know. Lots of trucks around here could fit that description. Your boy didn't happen to get a license number, did he? No, it was too dark. There's some city kids camping up near Old Man Kelly's place. Sounds like the kind of stuff they'd pull. Mind if I use your phone, Vern? Go ahead. - It was the Cullens. - What? Just don't push it unless you want to get. Vern! Oh, wait a minute. What do you know about this? Don't pay no mind to Vern's nonsense. He's been jealous of the Cullens ever since the ski resort bought their land. I'll check out those city kids. Get back to you in a couple of days, Mr. Morris. [hammering] That looks like it's going to hold for a while. Thanks. No problem. Maggie's going to give me a ride to town. You want to come? No. If I just go check out the fish around here. Clay loves to fish. Why don't you take him with you sometime? Yeah, that sounds good. Would mean a lot to me, Matt. I know it's hard for you to see, but he's a wonderful man. I know. Mom, I just wish you wouldn't keep trying to take the place of Dad. Matt. I know you love your father. And I wouldn't do anything in the world to change that. But you just didn't see all of it. He had his faults. Yeah, well he would have stopped that guy putting his hands all over you. Matt. Come on, Mom. Dad would have taken care of that before it even started. He wouldn't have wimped out like Clay did. You stop that right now. It's true, isn't it? You just don't understand. [honking] No, I guess I don't. [honking] Hi, Jenny. Hi. Isn't it a beautiful day? Wow. Oh. Looks like you could use some help, ma'am. I guess I couldn't have moved that myself. - What are neighbors for? - Well, I-- Ah! [clears throat] Can I help you, son? He's with me. Come on. That'll be $21.40. Put it on our tab. We don't keep tabs here. This is strictly a cash business. That don't go for us. It applies to everyone, even you. You are pushing it, asshole. Ben. He says we ain't got any credit. I ain't-- Shut up. Is that true? Don't ever question Cullen again. Ben. Put these on our tab too, city boy. Great. Any fish gets caught in that tangled mess of lines is a goner for sure. Seriously, you're never going to catch anything with a hook and a line. Fish around here are too smart for that. And all this time I thought fish were stupid. OK. I'll make you a deal. You stay here and catch the stupid fish. I'm going over there and catch the smart ones, OK? OK, deal. Listen I got some extra tackle if you want. This is all I need. That's it? That's your tackle? Old ways. Hey there, Vern. Something can do for you? Car's coming along real nice, Vern, real nice. Hear you've been talking about us. Hey, Ben, you know I wouldn't do nothing to-- Chatter, Old Vern here is calling me a liar. No! Ah! [choking sounds] Ah [smashing] You take care now, Vern. [giggling] You really don't expect to catch a fish with that thing, do you? You talk too much, boy. Watch and learn. Old ways. Wow, we made it, boy. And we only had to get out and push her three times. That's a record. Mr. Morris. I heard about you little welcome party last night. Well, just kids having fun. Some fun, huh? Hi, Will. Matt, supper's almost ready. Sure. I'm just going to be a second with Will. Broken moon. What? That's old legend. The cloud passes across the face of the moon like that, busts it open, supposed to spill evil out onto the Earth. You believe in evil? Yeah, sure, I guess. Here. Why are you giving these to me? I hate fish. Yeah, but you caught them. So? You eat them. What are these? Sacred symbols of my ancestors. Here is a beaver, taught us how to build. Here is an eagle. He guards us during the day. Over there is hunter wolf. Jeez, Will. You're quite the artist. No, just a storyteller. All these people in your family? - Family, friends, people I like. My grandfather, great shaman, medicine man. Yeah, he looks tough. He was till the day he dies. My dad, before the booze took him. My mom. Who's that? Harpo, my favorite Marx brother. Will, I think if this truck was a horse, I'd shoot it. I don't know. I sort of admire it's personality. I bet you I could fix it. - Yeah? How? Old ways. Still a smartass. Hey, you've got a tape deck. That's great. Can get this party rolling. What the hell do you call that? What's the matter, Will? You don't like music? Yeah. Let's hear some. [music - beach boys] Aren't you kind of cold out here? No, I'm fine. Ah, let me see. That's a nice piece of work. Will showed me how to use it. Ah. He's an odd kind of guy, isn't he? He's different. What's wrong with that? Nothing. But why don't you try making friends your own age? You know, like Arnie for instance. Yeah, Arnie. But the whole point is, I don't like-- The whole point is, Clay, you're trying to tell me who I can and cannot hang around with. I don't know what your problem is. Are you jealous of Will because he doesn't take shit from other people? Matt. You apologize to Clay. - No, no. Come on. Matt, you get back here. No, let him go. Let him go. It's OK. He has no right to talk to you like that. Now, come on. Come on. As you said yourself, give him time. I heard you that time, Will. This is our river. Pa don't let people fish here. It's OK. I'll let you fish here if you want. Thanks. I'm Becky. I'm Matt. I know. How did you know my name? There ain't no such things as secrets around here. You're from the city, aren't you? That's right. Do you miss it? Huh? The city, do you miss it? Yeah, I guess, a little. What are you doing? Nothing. Just taking a swim. Why not? It's your river, right? You can stay if you want. [motorcycle engine] Uh! You were looking at my sister. I think you're a pervert. Jimmy, let him go! I'm going to teach you a lesson, asshole! Swim, faggot! Don't Jimmy! You're hurting him! You wait till Pa hears. Get on. It doesn't make sense, Matt. Listen, I'm telling you the truth. I was standing there, talking to his sister, and the guy went nuts. You were just talking to her? Look what he did to him. Well, maybe you said something to make this Cullen boy angry or maybe-- Forget it then, all right? Just forget it. I don't even care anymore. Now, Matt. You better go talk with Jonah Cullen. Jesus, Jenny, what am I supposed to say to the man? I don't know. But the least you can do is stand up for Matt. I want to speak to your father. Well, state your business. One of your kids attacked my son for no reason. If you're accusing my family of something, you better have your facts damn straight. Jimmy. Get your sister out here. Show him what he did to you. Now. Now you tell him who beat on you, girl. It was Matt Morris. Look, young lady, are you sure it was Matt. He's never attacked-- It was your boy. He beat up on me. He did. Look, he's never in his life attacked anyone. There's no need to say anything more. They were going to drop it right here and now. After all, that's the neighborly thing to do. Why don't you get your ass on my property before I decide to stop being so neighborly. Matt! Matt, if you'll just listen to me. Leave me alone, Clay. Now, don't you walk out on me, son. Let's get something straight. I'm not your son and you are not my father. My father wouldn't let jerks like that push him around. No, I'm not your father and I don't pretend to be. Now we're different kinds of people, Matt. That's something you have to deal with, not me. Family totem pole. Guards the entrance. Now it's a real home. Got it? Hold it steady. Yep. Hey, Will, who's that. A friend of mine. Saved my life in Korea. Got himself killed doing it. You never told me you in the Army before. Yeah. They even put me in for a DSE medal. Never went to the ceremony. Getting out of there alive, that's the only thing I wanted. You know what? I mean I wish Clay was more like that. I mean, that guy's probably never had a fight in his whole life. Fighting don't make you a man, son. You take Clay. He's got more guts than most people. Not more than you. He's raising a family, a kid who ain't his own. That's a real man. Here, ancient potion. Yeah, what's it called? Coke. Old Coke. Here's to the ladies. May they never learn to enjoy poker. Say, Vern, that looks pretty bad. I'll survive. So let's deal the cards. All right. How about this city slicker showing you country boys how to play poker? Watch it, Clay. The city's where pigeons come from. Well, hello, neighbor. I better be going. And break up the game? That's not being friendly. Course, if you're afraid of losing, Stick around, Clay. We don't mind if Jonah plays, do we, boys? No, I don't mind. Hi. What do you want? Just want to see you. Yeah. Where's your shadow? - Jimmy isn't here. - Yeah? Good. Why don't you go join him. They made me lie. And I suppose you do everything they tell you to? Yes. Hey, Becky. I didn't know. I love your house. Will you show me around? My parents are going to be back. Please. No, we'd better not. Becky. Come on. Raise ten. Well, the dealer takes two. Five. Raise 10. That's 15 to you, Clay. Yeah, I'll see that. [laughs] Well? What? Well, how do I look? Fantastic. Well, that's it for the pretzels. Oh, listen, I can run across the street and get some. Oh, no, no, don't bother. I'll give them the-- No, I need the air. Five. 50. Pass. Well, I call. How many? I'll take two. From the top. What the hell is that supposed to mean? He mean anything, Ben. It was just a joke. Tell him it was a joke, Clay. It's a joke, Ben. Let it go Ben. What you got? Well, well, a full house. I guess you win. Know, if I didn't know better, I'd swear you were cheating. It's just like the pictures in the magazines. Well, that may be so, but, Becky, me and you can't, I mean, you can't take my mother dress. I'll just put it back in the closet. Becky, you can't take that with you. Becky! Becky! Come on, let's go. Go? [horse whinnies] Haven't you ever ridden a horse before? Well, sure, yeah, but where we're going go to? It's a secret. Come on. Hang on. To what? Ah! What are you doing here? I thought you could use some company. We're closed. Please leave. I'm warning you, get out of here before I start yelling. You don't want me to go. This is where you want it. Stop it. Your old man can't give you what I can. Stop it. Come on. You want it. You know you do. [scream] [sounds of struggle and choking] That was a mistake, old man. How did a boat get way out here? It's been here as long I can remember. I come here to be alone. It's sort of creepy isn't it? No, it's not. It's magic. You'll see. Come on. You Wait. Sure. You can come in now. A Who's that? It's my ma. She died. That, that must hurt. I'm used to it. Shh. What? Can you hear it? The ocean. Becky, there's no ocean around here. Sure there is. We're sailing far away. Where are we sailing to? There. You ever been there? New York? Yeah, once. Tell me about it. I don't know. There's not a lot to say. It's dirty and noisy and crowded. Are the girls pretty there? I guess. Prettier than me? You're beautiful. How was the poker game? Fine. Look, we've got to talk. We've got to get out of this place. That asshole back there. [crash] What the fuck? [inaudible] Clay, he's coming again. Get away. Bastards! Come on, Clay, get outa here. Come on, Clay. Come on, come on. [screams] Lock the doors. Lock the doors. You all right? Dammit. Don't touch me. Please don't touch me. Oh, God. No! [groaning] [thuds] [screams] [giggling] Dammit, Hogan, I just want you to do your job. Don't go telling me my job. Look, you don't seem to understand. Those people almost killed us last night. You got proof? Witnesses? What do you mean witnesses? That's what I thought. Don't worry, Mr. Morris. I told you I'll look into it. This is useless. Tomorrow I'm going to Burnaby to get the police. I'm going to put those bastards in jail where they belong. I'm leaving, Clay. Jenny. Matt and I are going tomorrow. I don't care what you do, but I'm getting out of here. For God's sakes, let's talk about this. [screams] (YELLING) You god damn whore. I told you stay away from boys. [inaudible] this god damn Morris boy. Of all the god damn kids. (SCREAMING) Stop! Will? Will! Will, did you see your carvings? They are all. Shit. Will, what happened to you? Them Cullen boys. Will. Let it lay. Where are you going? Away. You mean you're running away. I've been running for years. Once more won't make any difference. Don't give me that. You've been nothing but a liar. What happened to all that stuff about settling down, Will? This is your home. I ain't got no home. Ain't nothing here no more. What are these for? Look after it for me, will you? Will, I can't take your truck. You're the only one that can keep the damn thing running. Now, will you get that pile of junk out of my sight. Go on. Get the hell out of here. Will. [scream] Mom? Don't hurt him. Take him downstairs. Leave her alone. You raped my sister, boy. That's a lie! Now you're going to see what happens to people that fuck with us. We got a law around here an eye for an eye. Leave her alone. [screaming] You stay away from me. [screaming] Get off her! Look, boy. You take her. I'll kill you right where you stand, you little fucker. Drop the gun. I said, drop the gun! Don't try it. Now, Becky. Don't come any closer. Get your mom out of here. Go! Stop, Judd. You're turning against family, girl. No more, Ben. I'm your brother, Becky. You wouldn't shoot me, would you? Give me the gun, Becky. [gunshot] Becky, get in the truck! Stay away from me. Becky! You don't think I'll do it, Judd? [gunshot] [inaudible] Matt! Becky, you bitch! [screaming] Shh. Shh. Shh. Shh. Oh, shh. It's all right. It's all right. Shh. Those animals. Look after your mother, Matt. Going somewhere, Mr. Morris? Stay away from me, Hogan. I'm going to go out there and get those bastards that raped my wife and not you nor anyone else is going to stop me. Clay. I told you to stay with your mother. You're being a damn fool. I've known Jonah Cullen all my life. Might listen to me. But he sure as shit won't listen to you. Now why should I trust you? I'm all the help you're going to get. I'm going with you. God damn it, Matt, for once in your life, will you do what I say? Clay, they made me watch. Please, son, look after your mother. We won't be long. - Clay, I'm not-- Please, Matt. Matt! Don't go up there. Becky, I have to go. You can't Listen, Becky, Clay might need my help. Matt, you don't know them. Jeez, Becky. They may be your family, Becky. They're not my family.
