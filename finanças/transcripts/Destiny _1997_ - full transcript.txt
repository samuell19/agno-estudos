She complains that l'm stingy but she feeds the whole neighborhood lf it weren't for me, you'd all look like him! Our eyes would turn blue? Don't take another bite.

Go get my date bread Just one bite and she'll turn green with envy - Take it to her - l'm no delivery boy! l'm the son of the Caliph! As modest as his father Tell on me then, Uncle! lf l were your father, l'd disown you! l'm going dancing! Unbelievable! The Caliph's son wants to be a dancer! We call this culture?

What's wrong? lt's my sons, Nasser and Abdallah They're failures You're finally thinking about them! They're vulnerable What do you expect of them? What do you want them to be: thinking men or lackeys? l've run circles around the Spaniards - We're talking about your sons - You're obsessed! You're the one who's worried! All that interests Nasser is horses and girls And Abdallah is beyond all hope lf l lock him in his room, he escapes l threaten him.. l even beat him, but it's hopeless He slips away Give him real responsibilities You treat him like a mere servant All he's good for.. is gypsy dancing lf you saw how he danced.. Dancing! My son, a dancer! And what if he's happy dancing? When my daughter disagrees with me, she just blurts out: "You're wrong!" lnstead of being our children's enemies, let's try to persuade them Childish soul-searching pales in comparison with the reality of Conquest! Checkmate All the better! You see? l'm unbeatable! Goodnight Stay and learn to play lf l don't get to bed, l'll collapse - You're like Abdallah! - We both love life!

Did you tell anyone? l want to tell the whole world! Abdallah loves Sarah. He's wild about her Too bad she doesn't .. No, l love you too Terribly Mere words lf Manuela finds out, she'll kill me - She trusts me - And you're betraying her lt's not my fault. lt's the Devil He's a naughty boy.. a dirty little rascal Every time we meet, l feel it's going to be the last The son of the Caliph and a poor gypsy girl.. You may think l'm strange but that's just the way l am Soad! At your service They're staring at Abdallah When you're a Caliph's son, people stare You're worried sick, as if he were your own son l'd take a son like him any day, faults and all! He's sulking He won't speak to anyone Get him to dance. He's dying to... The son of the Caliph? You're all out of your minds! He's had too much to drink Quiet, please! l have a poem Loving you is a slow death. My heart grieves And when my torment becomes unbearable, l invoke my woeful heart and shout: "Why pine away for someone who ignores you? "Why care for so uncaring a creature? "You, prisoner of pride and vanity" Such depth in so few words lt's by Abu Nawas lt's amazing! You're so young and already a genius! Stay with us a while Share your learning with us What does "prisoner of pride" mean? lt's sort of what happens when your heart is sort of... lt comes from deep inside. Sort of l'm overwhelmed l'll never attain your level of insight Only a true thinker can appreciate such verse You're a born poet Every word you say is like... A pearl! A string of pearls! A Caliph's son mixing with commoners! You're modesty itself! People like you are rare God keep you for your people lf only you could spend all night with us.. The night is still young We can wait #Hear me, lovers of life #Hearts are ablaze #in the bonfire of love #lf the moon hid itself, #a thousand other moons #would light up the night #They'd open the way #for a thousand paths to the impossible #Even if you're late, rosy sunrise, #source of life, we know you'll come back #You'll dazzle our eyes and brighten our souls, #and you'll make us masters of our destiny #We'll dance as we please #And our dreams will dance deep in our hearts #Jezebel! #We defy life with song #We defy life with song #Our hearts keep the beat #Our voices sing the tune #Our feet #stomp to the rhythm #Make haste #The road we must travel is long #and we have no other #Every step we take is a burning torch #guiding us on our way #We will not go astray #Dawn comes, lighting our way #to a shimmering day #Dawn comes, lighting our way #to a shimmering day #And if attacked, #our dreams fight back #Resist! Fight! #And vanquish! #We must remain masters of our destiny - Let's go - Not without him The Caliph's son? l have orders They said: "Don't come back without him" - He'll slip away - You think so? Here he comes Poet! - Will you join us? - Why not? You won't be disappointed Say you're sorry! Say it! How can l? You're gagging me!

Emir, bless us! ls anything wrong? No, l'm fine A lazy fool learns two verses of the Koran and passes himself off as a purveyor of divine truth. ls this man pious? A true understanding of these texts requires years of reflection, research and labor lf we believe these self-proclaimed geniuses, we disregard this Koranic verse: "ln the name of Allah the Merciful "The ignorant man, whose vain words lead astray from the way of God "and take it in mockery will be met by a humbling chastisement "True is the word of Almighty God" No one can claim to know the whole truth Not even Caliph Mansur? The lmam Malek said, pointing to the Prophet's tomb: "Every man can be questioned except for him who lies here" The lmam El-Chafei said: "A true opinion can seem false and a false opinion, true" Averroes outsmarted him Borhan is inept Be patient Borhan is craftier than you think. You'll see The Koran is clear. Are you inciting us to doubt it? The Prophet said: "lf your quest leads to truth, you will have two parts "lf it leads to error, one part. All quests are rewarded" "Lord, increase me in knowledge" Knowledge? What about faith? Are you contesting God? He outsmarted him again! Averroes said: "Revelation can be interpreted only by study" We should have answered: "The Text allows no interpretation" lf you're so clever, answer him yourself and get your own flock of admirers We have to silence Averroes We must coerce the Caliph into forbidding him to teach There's no use bickering We'll take the necessary measures "Be patient as the Messengers possessed of constancy" They leave the mosque one by one, pretending your lesson bores them lt's surely a ruse plotted by an invidious mind l should "plot" a little song for them Careful. Your song could cost you your life What happened? Not now Everyone, out! A pretty girl like you taking care of the laundry And not of you? l'm ready and willing to help you discover the pleasures of this world The nerve of you! Son of a Caliph or not, if you keep at it, l'll slap you! l'll throw you in jail and tickle you to death Brute! He'll be on his feet in a week or so For the time being, he needs to rest Good going, Nasser Removing the knife would have killed him Did you see who attacked him? He was about twenty.. with a crazed look in his eyes - Why didn't you catch him? - And leave Marwan? Smart thinking! My horse kicked one of them in the face l'd recognize the hoof-print Do something or every philosopher will perish Marwan, a philosopher? His songs belittle my father lt's your father's fault. He's giving the fanatics free rein lf l were in charge, l'd show you! l can just see you on the throne Over there. Get off my "throne" Marwan! Shut the gates l'm looking after my husband now! Understand? The security of the Almohad dynasty has never been so threatened Where have you been, High Judge Averroes? And you, governor of Cordoba? And you, the crown prince? The country is foundering After all we've done, who would dare protest? People are exploiting religion and you're letting them They're the only ones we hear in the mosques You'd be heard if you were as eloquent as these men of faith Merchants of faith, if you ask me Whether they rant on about Arab victories or about religion, they're only defending their interests Stop philosophizing. We're talking about one man - lt's not... - Nasser! Find the assailant and have him executed lt's not a man, but a movement gnawing away at your authority No movement in the world can shake my throne These barbarians are jeopardizing our culture What are you waiting for? Go execute my sentence Have the assailant interrogated He may tell us what's ailing our country The country isn't ailing. lt's in fine shape The danger is real They're a menace to the whole realm, not just Andalusia They've indoctrinated.. thousands of young people By magic? l think the assailant was manipulated by conspirators Let the law decide Show in the commander of the cavalry ln my opinion.. You have opinions now? Opinions, positions.. Convictions, too. A lot more than you think Why not take my throne from me? Turn my people into a dance troupe! lf my ideas bore you, l'll go elsewhere Find a mosque and speak your heart out! Why not? l have a mouth You do. lt's a brain you don't have God help you - What? - God bless you High Judge! Does he deserve to die? The Caliph's moods have replaced our laws Go kill the boy. Obey your father's orders! His Highness demands blind allegiance - Maybe l should... - You decide lf l were you, l'd think it over Think hard This is only the beginning! My son! My child! Why arrest him? Anyone could have done it! Where are you taking him? Did you attack Marwan because of his poems? - l've never read them - Why then? lf God lets me live, l'll stab him again He's the enemy of God - You didn't dress your wound - lt's a sin Who told you Marwan is an enemy of God? Good Muslims don't sing He's stark-raving mad He repeats like a parrot without understanding How do they kill all feelings in these boys and turn them into criminals? He has a brother who escaped from the sect He tried to kill him too l'd like to meet the brother l'll get him No.. let's go to his house They made my head spin with flattery. l believed them "You're so smart.. so unique.. "Every word you speak is a pearl. Show us the way.. "Let's go spend a few days in the desert "lf we meditate together, we'll be as one "Nothing will ever tear us apart" Then they began to wear us down Praying until dawn, marching through the desert.. endlessly.. in the burning sun Not knowing where we were going, or why.. Our feet burnt by the sand "lt purifies the soul and strengthens the will" ln fact, it shattered our wills We became slaves to the Emir's will l was instructed to tell people that they had become impious, that they had to regain the path to Truth Follow my advice and you'll see the way Just like our Emir, who sees all, past, present and future One day, he saw me steal from my mother and stick my finger in her eye He shouted: "You shall deliver the world from the enemies of God" He guides my weapon Every throat l cut takes me one step closer to Paradise Yesterday he had a vision: l was dressed in white, on my way to Paradise Everything l'd ever longed for was laid out before me That can only mean that l'm very close to being delivered How about me? We chose you, didn't we? l shouldn't tell you this The Emir had a vision of you ruling over Andalusia with all of us at your feet We are your true family Flee those who are in the clutches of the Devil Open your heart and tell me all about yourself All right? All right What does your son do? Nothing at all! Everyone says he's a good-for-nothing! He should find a job! You find him one! You know lots of people You're an important man What can he do? He never liked studying. He likes giving orders Make a soldier out of him! Someone told him: "Learn a few verses and you can order people around" Who wants to keep on being a good-for-nothing? Does murder make you good for something? - Answer me - Stop harassing him! Has he lost his tongue? He's been silent for a month. When he does talk, he says: "l'll make you rich, you and all the neighbors!" Then he goes back to bed and he sleeps. And sleeps! Once thoroughly exhausted, you're ready to obey any orders. lf they say "Kill your father," you do it And if you get caught, they're the first to turn on you What do you think, Sheik Riad? Can someone regain his dignity by stabbing a poet? The only right way is the way of the Lord Had Marwan lost his way? Marwan is old enough to know right from wrong "Evil is self-evident" Can these three children tell good from evil? lt's up to the High Judge to decide God says: "He who smites shall be smitten" lf they are executed, they'll say they're martyrs on the way to Paradise lt's better that they enjoy their lives on earth! "For this world, act as if you were eternal, for the next, as if you must die tomorrow" He's a child! What does he know about death and eternity? Quiet! Listen to the judgement Revelation is destined only to those endowed with Reason That is, mankind Divine law combines Revelation and Reason lt consists in determining causes and effects, mean and ends Revelation encompasses Reason and Reason encompasses Revelation Certain children confuse religion and ignorance Certain adults turn ignorance into a religion Our young defendants were led into perdition Without realizing it, they were forced astray ln its great equity, lslam refuses to condemn an unsound mind The High Court abstains from capital punishment and sentences the accused to five years in prison "God shall not be questioned, but they shall be questioned" He deserved to die ls our house so terrible? There's plenty to eat and drink We all help each other But no. He wants everyone to obey him and call him "Emir" My son, the frog, wants to be a prince What's the joy in giving orders? The judge won't change his mind, will he? l trust Averroes From your mouth to God's ears! Long live Averroes! May God illuminate your way with His heavenly light! You're madmen talking about reason! What more do you want? The boys confessed You flouted my authority by sparing him The country is going to the dogs! Didn't l order him to be killed? Listen to me, brother. The boy is only eighteen Fate saved Marwan by averting his knife Marwan has forgiven him Marwan? Since when is Marwan a judge? How can l protect you? They weren't responsible for their acts Sheik Riad says otherwise. So does the Council of Theologians l decide what's in the country's interest Not Sheik Riad. Not you. Me You refuse all advice? The Council agrees with me They're very unhappy with your verdict The Sheik is scheming.. The same old hallucinations Maybe As long as l'm Judge, my conscience will guide me Even if l lose face? Brother, your dignity is not in question You've always been merciful. Think of the lives at stake l won't go back on my word This time, tragedy struck the sons of your citizens Next time, it may strike your own sons - l can protect them - Lucky for them But don't forget: Your citizens are your sons too - Where is Saad? - The brother? l found him a job lf you can't hide him, l will How beautiful! Our city must be the envy of the whole world Why did that idiot Emir of yours send Borhan to my house? One more blunder and l'll cut off his funding Better yet.. his head - l have a request - l paid you Three " suicides" . l've had to shut some mouths l have a favor to ask. l can be of use to you Speak l want to become a judge again and regain my lost honor Averroes branded me a common thief You were stupid He caught you accepting bribes. He's alert l'm not after his position l just want to be a judge again You could take his place You have a pretty face Your beard is reason enough for me to give you his job By resigning, you accuse my father He's your best friend You refuse him the benefit of the doubt you give to criminals How can your father ignore what's going on? Those boys were bound hand and foot and hanged in nooses made of their clothes lt's their custom! When they're caught, they commit suicide! No, they were "suicided" so they can't talk! The sects are all over Not in my courts! That would be the death of Andalusia The Caliph is not above the law He too is accountable for his acts Decadence is gnawing away at kingdoms everywhere Lies and corruption have replaced justice and morality There's more at stake than a few dead boys Our culture, whose source is lslam, is threatened My father is protecting it! He built you a library! He had you analyze Aristotle! You wrote your commentaries thanks to him! And thanks to him, my mother had me! Say it! Here's my resignation You're not through with me yet l knew it. Averroes would never abandon us and leave Sheik Riad to do as he pleases He expected a death sentence from you lt was in his interest And you outfoxed him - Three boys were killed! - Every cloud has a silver lining What do you mean? Forget my father. Let's keep an eye on Sheik Riad Get up Get up and pray There's the east Get up! Die, but die pure Marwan asked you here because he loves you He's been waiting for you all week Why didn't you come? My only duty is to avoid the Demon Who is the Demon? Me? Marwan? Or his assailant? lf you were pure, you'd know who attacked him Thank God, there are serene people who see clearly What do these geniuses say? The true culprit is in the palace Your father? The Caliph doesn't need mercenaries Are you crazy? Your father! "Darkness swallows up stray souls" Your father? " Abandon all Evil and you shall be saved" God keep you Abdallah! Manuela, you're the only person l still love Don't make me hate you What's gotten into him? He's running away from me Because l'm pregnant With Abdallah's child? The Caliph's son? Woe betide us! Sarah's carrying Abdallah's child That explains his behavior When his father learns a gypsy will inherit the throne he'll slit the baby's throat! lf he came back, then he loves you. That's all that counts He's crazy. She'd best forget him l'll never be able to forget him! Neither will l. We're the ones to blame We brought them together. lt's not Sarah's fault Or Abdallah's l'll raise the child myself. No one will know a thing! Are you moving, Joseph? l'm looking for a safe hiding place. You never know.. This is his life's work The house of the High Judge isn't safe enough? You must have a special place where you keep your valuables You mean my jewels? l've never had any! Averroes is poor? He spends everything on his books and students Come here. Put them in the cellar Put them behind the sacks of flour Take this Aristotle! Even without gallows You're driving me crazy with your gallows! One more word about criminals and executioners and l'll send the lamb next door! - l'll let you starve! - Let's talk about happiness Come sit next to me Come here, my love What is happiness? At daybreak, after l prepare your tea, l go back to bed and the rest of the world can go to hell lt's pure bliss What else? When Salma was born, she didn't even cry. l thought l'd die! Then she started gurgling. l looked at her. She was so pretty Gorgeous! Salma, here we are! l've brought Marwan! lt's been ages! Marwan's back! l'm fine, thank God. lt's good to see you all again! You're back on your feet Manuela is grateful for all you've done How is my queen doing? Nasser, you behaved like a true hero Sing your song to your heart's content for we can still sing And we'll keep on singing day in, day out, for the rest of our lives No, come back! Come on What a catastrophe! - Take shelter! - All my books.. destroyed! All your books are here. None are missing They're all here "Commentary on Aristotle" A little messy, but intact My "Aristotle" .. l can't believe it You're the best! How did you guess? Son of a witch! All this for a bean-pole who saves some books! l save his life and what do l get? Nothing! A book is worth a hundred lives Maybe not for me.. but for Averroes - This is getting serious - Maybe Joseph forgot a lamp No, this is Sheik Riad's doing Before, he just wanted to distract us Now he'll use arson and murder to silence us How evil! A pure man like you cannot imagine that others can stood so low You're pure too Even l have a hard time believing it Sheik Riad craves power for power's sake lf my suspicions are founded, he should hang six times He's the richest man in the land. What more could he want? Power He'd do anything for it. He's driven by hunger Does my father know? l sincerely hope so Sheik Riad is loyal. Don't be ridiculous He has always stood by my side You gave him a lot of land in return Does he want all Andalusia? l need him People respect him. Let me rule my country And get rid of Averroes? Sheik Riad, the man you accuse, opposes the fatwa that the Council demands They want to burn all of Averroes' books This one above all "The lncoherence of lncoherence" l've read it You understand their dismay So that's why they set fire to his library They all seem to agree with Ghazali He's a great thinker and Averroes says he's wrong What if Averroes is right? He's too sure of himself He lacks modesty He insists on calling me "brother" Where did he get that from? Are we related now? l had no idea. Your uncle is his latest dupe My uncle loves him That may be our downfall Do you realize what a fatwa means? The annihilation of all of Averroes' works As if he never existed What are you making? A basket So Sheik Riad's protecting me? From which fatwa? The one he recommended to the Council - You knew about it? - Of course And you didn't tell us? lt's a sword hanging over our heads - My father will intervene - No, he won't This is all so sad The two of you were so close Sheik Riad has spoiled that now This is the logical consequence of my acts l have to accept it This fatwa threatens more than your books Your life is in danger We all have to die someday l'd rather die in bed, surrounded by weeping women Lots of flowers and a stately funeral But what's the difference if l die in a street? That's suicide! - What's wrong with him? - Nothing! He confronts hardships that would topple a mountain! Only l can understand him Get back to your work How many students has he had? He's educated at least one son in every family He's taught a lot and given much With one hundred students, we can recopy his work in two weeks Two copies of each book Nasser.. are there rumors in the palace? - Let's make... - Three copies of each! Manuela, Sarah and l will work day and night Namuela? This is supposed to be a secret! Manuela outrivals you and your ancestors! She's educated! She swears in 5 languages! l'll take a copy to France - lt's too dangerous! - lt's to save my uncle's work l was thinking that... ls Blue Eyes predicting the future again? Forget France! l'll take them to Marrakesh Everyone's a relative there Joseph wants to help and you give him a hard time! l'm starting now l know his work by heart. l'll dictate l'll do these with Manuela and Sarah lf you so much as blink, l'll hang you from the minaret Understood? Uncle, Averroes must know nothing of our voyages From me? My lips are sealed #Wisdom guides the virtuous theologian #in his study of what we call "syllogism" #And divine law guides the philosopher #in his study of what we call "reason" #Reason is the study of divine law. Philosophy is the study of wisdom #Everything that has been deduced #from divine law is subject to interpretation #No devout Muslim can doubt this #Reason is the sister of divine law #The supposed conflict between them #is a malicious invention Taste this Why are you wearing all that? Have you caught cold? Aunt Zeinab, l want you to know... you're like a mother to me Not now Taste this Your blue eyes tell me you're leaving You're going home? My heart tells me you'll soon be back l'll put aside a jar of dates for you l'll be back.. l promise lt's safer if you travel by night lt's best if l mix with the crowds lf my father had done that, he'd still be alive You're like a brother But.. l'm in love with someone else With Nasser My country is full of ignorance and misery, but l love it l have to go pass on to them what l've learned here Come what may? You really do love Averroes l'm not the only one.. This is a letter for him That's his most important book. Have a safe trip Tell your people that what we Arabs respect most is loyalty And tell your people that what we Christians respect most is honesty #The best moments of my life were those l spent with you #But what can be better #than saving books that will enlighten mankind? #Your benevolence and kindness have overwhelmed me #After everything l've learned, #l couldn't risk your forbidding me to go #This decision comes from deep within me. lt is entirely mine #lf you won't forgive me, #at least be indulgent #You said: "Wherever we are, knowledge is a homeland #and ignorance, a foreign place" #l promise to return to the land of humanism #and of love #Your son, Joseph Manuela thinks that Abdallah has joined a sect They've been stalking him They nabbed him at the inn He kept going to the desert and coming back covered with sand He told me to mind my own business. Now he's gone again Does Marwan know? Marwan was half-dead and Abdallah told him to pray He told me: "The real culprit is in the palace" l said: "Your father? You're crazy" And you kept quiet? l thought he was avoiding Sarah What for? What a bunch of idiots! Marwan, l need to see you Did you know about Joseph? Yes, l did He can save your books if he wants. We all can Stay seated What would a member of a sect be learning in his third week of training? How to handle arms Where would that happen? Wait for the water to settle! What are you doing? The more water, the more you see lf he knew you were improving his invention, Alhazen would roll over in his grave l'm here to find Abdallah That's all lt won't be easy to get in there lf you see him there, come tell me Get some rest. We'll keep watch Are you crazy? Here? lnstead of sitting around let's make a baby lf we were able to, Abdallah would worry us less So then, let's just make love Say yes and l'll get Abdallah back lt'll help me concentrate You filthy brute! Worse than the gypsies! You're obsessed Hands off or l'll scratch out your eyes And l'll pull out your hair Get it? Now you try Wait until you hear someone shout "His Grace!" Then get a good look He only shows his face once a year Marwan, get up! Abdallah's there! l saw him! His Grace! An angel.. There are a lot of them Protect the Emir! Have them move back! Get back! l want him on my horse Can't you hear? Get him on the horse! Abdallah! Tie his hands behind his back Go join the others You too Stand up! We're respecting our agreement with Sheik Riad We attack in two weeks. We expect Cordoba to be ready No fighting. No resistance Everything is in place Sheik Riad will seem the perfect patriot l trust him implicitly Why would he risk losing what he's strived for all these years? The battle will allow us to eliminate Mansur - And his heirs? - His sons? One babbles with the philosophers, the other eats out of our hands And the philosophers? By the time they're understood, we'll be in power - You're well-informed - With all due modesty.. Smuggling books.. what decadence! Where were you? The whole palace is looking for you! "The infidels and blasphemers will burn in Hell" Then to hell with all of us! Why were you with those fanatics? You've made a mess of your life - You have no right to question me - But l am Answer me! You want to kill Marwan? Why not kill me? Or our father? Kill him "They'll suffer shame in this world and a mighty chastisement in the next" Out of my house, you lout! - Madwoman! - Go away! He's the crown prince! Does that allow him to hit his brother? This is my house! l pay the tithe. So get out! Who is he? Just the crown prince Welcome to our humble home He's not welcome at all! Why not? He's a brute who hits his brother! Your brother hits you all the time He's a brute too! - Even your father. Look - Mother, not now Stay put or you're dead! He'll stay here until he's back in shape You may be a son to me, but none of your tricks Be a good boy. l'll make you some saffron rice We'll celebrate. He'll sing and dance like before Averroes was right Things are never as simple as they seem Your assailants were like him He's a criminal too He should be punished He's your brother Where was he hiding all this hate? Those lunatics unleashed it! They're experts at instilling hate Go ask Averroes He knows their methods now And he says to fight hate with hate? The Christians are pushing us into the sea You're busy playing with the gypsies while l'm here all by myself building the greatest fleet in history - This time, it's serious - No more than any other time! Your lack of foresight makes you an unworthy prince and an unworthy human being And you consider yourself a worthy father? l'll forgive you. They're not your words Averroes has managed to turn you against me They kidnapped Abdallah and shattered his will You told me he joined them willingly They'll make a man of him - They'll make a criminal of him - Keep him under guard What else can l do for you? Take us seriously l don't eat the food of sinners You've become too skinny - Your heart... - My heart is my business Stomp on it, if you want. But be careful.. l'm in it God alone is in my heart But God is love Our Emir eats only a date a day But you said he was an angel You and l are mortals. Or have you become an angel? Eat. You're skin and bones "To withstand God's ordeals is a virtue" Your brother is right They've hardened your heart Bon appetit! #Sing your song to your heart's content #for we can still sing #And we'll keep on singing #day in, day out, for the rest of our lives #And if ever one day #they try to break you, #stand up tall #like the proud palm tree #reaching up to the sky #Don't let them beat you. Don't let them break you #Don't let them scare you #Be like a dream, blossoming in the desert #Sing your song to your heart's content, #for we can still sing Only dancing can bring him back to us #Your song, resounding amongst mankind, #will make the night's heart beat with joy #and heal the wounds of the innocent #Will you dance? #l will too #Despite myself, l'll dance too #Despite myself.. despite myself.. l'll dance too #Until your dream is entwined with mine.. #despite myself, l'll dance too Soon enough, you'll be dancing in hell! Maybe. But look at you You've made your hell on earth! Get off your horse Kneel down and beg for mercy Perfect Marwan! All infidels will meet the same fate We shall purge society of the vile Mansur The country will now live according to the precepts of God, His Prophet, and his successor You're faced with the choice of a lifetime lf you want to, take my horse, follow them l wish it had been you who delivered the mortal blow To die by your hand He's dead! Murderer! l'm to blame for Marwan's death How presumptuous! He alone decided to die For him, saving you was a duty - l'd never have thought... - Thought? You let others do the thinking for you lf you want a shoulder to cry on, a word of warning: l'm neither Marwan, nor your father - Marwan wasn't my father - He chose to be That's far more noble than giving life He taught you to love life And he paid the price My real father never cared about me Every man has his limits Your father can't give what he hasn't got You're no longer a child You're responsible for your choices You're too old to whine: "Mother hit me, Father neglected me "and he preferred my brother "l hate the whole world so l'll accuse it of being impious" That's too easy Too easy to justify the laziness, hatred and jealousy you carry within yourself by blaming it on others Do you aspire to greatness? You'll reach it by doing something for others What's impious is reveling in your hatred That's heresy! - l want to spread God's word - Whose do l spread? The Devil's ? You? Spreading God's word? How presumptuous You're so hollow, you repeat whatever nonsense you're told Learn a poem and a Koranic verse and you're a poet and scholar? What do you know about medicine and astronomy, about mathematics and chemistry, about philosophy? Do you know enough about love, about truth, about justice to claim to be able to spread God's word? Answer me! Why do l keep on writing? My idea don't reach anyone anymore! Why should l wait for them to burn my books? l'll burn them myself! lt's every man for himself! Let them burn! Keep out of it! l'm not an animal! Animals have more heart than you and your sect! Do you understand? Zeinab! l was worse with him than they were God forgive me You kicked me out of your house And l'll do it again Do you want me to leave? Nasser was Marwan's best friend. He's come to console you You were all so handsome Three suns which merged into one Nasser Joseph and Marwan l've come to thank you for the joy you gave him Thanks to you, not only Marwan, but all of us learned about the joy of life Still here? You're not with your "friends" ? Marwan had to die? - Nasser! - How can you allow him here? Marwan always looked after Abdallah like a son Can't we forget? Can't we forgive? Console him. He's lost his father... Marwan Sing your song to your heart's content, for we can still sing Nasser! Don't let yourself be blinded by hate Saving this one book was worth all the risks Read me something from it l'm going back You're resigning, like a lowly employee? Go, if you want to No one is indispensable to me l'll find ten others like you lt's my father who appointed you l inherited you from him ln that case, l may go.. You may not! You're a commoner now. You're subject to my whims Dismissed! All this fuss over the death of a cockroach They claim responsibility for Marwan's death and menace their enemies with the same They undermine justice and your authority Riad rules the streets Are you sure it's Sheik Riad who rules the streets? Or is it you? Why not? l'm not interested in power But you're interested in glory. ln immortality Living on for posterity Don't worry. Sheik Riad knows his limits Let's hope so Show me a man who is not a slave to his pride His place is in my heart You hate me l hate ignorance and vanity - You think l'm vain? - l think Sheik Riad is No need to fear. l'm more clever than he is Sit down Such is politics Politics without morality is doomed to failure Don't you see? The political situation decides for us Our conscience should decide lf l didn't owe you some respect, l'd destroy you Destroy me rather than both yourself and the country l won't write anymore Then they've won. They've broken you and severed you from Mansur Had l stayed with him, l'd have ended up hating him or myself lf you could hate him, you wouldn't be grieving A friend who is spurned seeks revenge. He despises himself for the love he once gave lt's just me and you l esteem neither your politics nor your company l'm not thrilled about yours either Go console your friend in his fall - Providence is on his side - And not on mine? l thought no one was indispensable to you Can we really expect... Can we expect a man to be a great strategist, a great leader and a good, loving father? We ask nothing of your father He is what he is. We must make our own way My way is... to Egypt Tomorrow at dawn Now that's a decision! You better stick to it - You agree? - l agree if the decision is yours, if you put your father behind you, if you forgive Abdallah and if you say you love me as l love you You're in love with Joseph The day he left, you stared into his eyes from the roof My mother likes his blue eyes too l saw you kiss him! He's the one who kissed me When you leave, l'll go to the roof and stare at you Will you? Swear to God that you'll marry me - Another decision! - l'll tell your father - He knows l love you - You told him? - My mother did - She knows? Everyone knows but you Go. When you come back, my trousseau will be ready l'll go faster than my shadow Father will refuse your trip and our marriage - l demand both - Or nothing at all We'll stand up to him The two of us... together What are you waiting for? Someone's permission? Joseph would have... Let them burn my books! Someone else can write them! Great thinkers don't grow on trees! Too bad. Such is my destiny and that of the nation l'm scared, but l'm letting him go You write books to incite people, to rouse them, to make them think! We have a right to take a stand and share the risks! She sounds just like her father! Thank God she looks like her mother! Quiet! My husband is gorgeous! l have to take responsibility for my decisions Exactly Besides, l'm the Caliph's son l'll make myself respected No one will be able to stop me He's already proved his worth Salma and l are for He and l are against Are we? How about me? Salma and Nasser are for. You and Abu Yehia are against l've always played fair l'm with them. That makes three against two lsn't that right? You're always right, my love Go... No one can deprive the world of wisdom God keep you l'll do our children proud As soon as we have some Where are they? Here and there. They're approaching Guadalquivir They're a stone's throw away. Where did we go wrong? After Alarcos, we wasted our fighting forces in futile battles. Our army has suffered Nothing l do is futile Sire... The enemy is here and we jabber away How about the enemies within? They're undermining your power Your friend Averroes warned you lf you mention his name again, l'll throw you in jail! Go ahead. You're the Caliph People bow, even when you fart! lt's Averroes who divided the nation! He just happens to resign when the enemy attacks He just happens to send my son God knows where And the enemy happens to read his books! Do they contain military secrets? ldeas belong to all of mankind Our kingdom was born of an idea. ldeas will live on long after you and l fall into oblivion l'll win this battle. lt's his ideas that will perish ldeas have wings. No one can stop their flight l can! l'll have all his books burnt! l'll banish him! lt'll be the end of Almohad culture and all of Andalusia l am Andalusia! Not him! Open the doors! Show Sheik Riad in Can you rally the people? Of course How long will it take? A day... a moment... They're waiting for you Ever since our glorious Saladin - God bless his soul - set Jerusalem free, unifying Arab people the world over, Christians have sought revenge Their one wish is to destroy our empire which has enlightened the world for over six centuries They want Andalusia to sink back into misery and ignorance They'll burn our homes, kill our children. They want our blood Can we let the enemy take back the land which our forefathers turned into a paragon of civilization? Can we? God has given us a leader even more glorious than Saladin! Our mentor is pure. He is courageous and inspired Mansur the Victorious! Commander of the believers of Andalusia! We are your soldiers, Victorious One! Glorious believers.. The world will soon know that Paradise is for the pure of heart What happened, Sheik Riad? You left during my speech lt is you who inspires the people You and you alone Whatever you say arouses their enthusiasm They hung upon your every word There's no use talking about land and honor Just tell them it's God's will. Every one of them will obey You're a real saint. And a clever one at that For foundering in the ocean of illusion and obscuring the people's judgement, the Caliph forbids the following people from teaching in schools and mosques. Furthermore, the Caliph orders that their books be burnt in public and that they be banished lt's Averroes! Are you hurt? Al-Razi, only you can be entrusted with this l don't always agree with what Averroes says, but under such circumstances it is my duty to save these books My father has great respect for Averroes, but... He ordered these books burnt and their author banished lt will soon take effect l learned of this yesterday Sheik Riad has won Run back to Averroes lf he sees his books burn without knowing they've been saved, he'd die "Commentary on Aristotle by Averroes of Andalusia" "The lncoherence of lncoherence" #Subjective, conflicting interpretations of divine law #which assert their veracity above all others #have torn the country apart #We are all to be held responsible for these rifts, #for these schisms Tell her she's wrong! No, your mother is right Everything stays but the bench Take the cupboard while you're at it! Remember? Life is so cruel with us Leaving everything... We've been through worse. As long as we're together... we'll pull through Tell me Do you remember this bench? Of course l do. l thought you'd forgotten Our first night.. On the bench.. God forgive you! Thank God, you're safe Nasser's back l want him docile or l want him dead Meeting like this is a true blessing lndeed l'm going to betray one of Sheik Riad's secrets The Spaniards want peace Who wouldn't ? "lf they incline to peace, incline to it" They want us to reduce the army and give out some gifts to pacify the people and make them amenable Trade will thrive. We all stand to profit from it What does the Caliph of Andalusia think? My father is the Caliph of Andalusia Al-Mansur He's given enough. He deserves a long rest l've been trained to kill you From behind? Go ahead.. Won't your hand obey? Do it l could have if they'd reached my heart But they only played with my mind Who's "they" ? Those you wish to please by burning his books Justice is done! Too late l know your books are safe in Egypt Of course Abdallah almost killed me Sheik Riad has sided with the Spaniards l was offered your throne They lost l'm ready to fight now So am l Heaven has answered your prayers, Sheik Riad. Enter Not thwarting Averroes' plans would have been disastrous He can do us no more harm Now that we are unified, we can confront the enemy together You and your sects will go to the front line As a shield An example for those willing to die in the name of lslam Victory or death.. both lead to Paradise - l'm not a warrior - Come now! Your eloquence alone gets the masses marching! Have you nothing to say, Sheik Riad? Who'll run the country? No one. lt will run itself - The philosophers can do no more harm - l'm an old man Don't underestimate yourself! You're in fine health! l know my dream will come true l saw you leading the army, charging with the troops, dressed in white, a sword in hand - l've never held a weapon - Now's your chance! The mettle of a warrior is apparent only in battle - Sword against sword - Take mine We know that the enemy is gathering near Jaen Get your men ready. We attack at daybreak We're attacking them at Jaen? That's what our new "general" will tell them - We'll attack at Alarcos - Perfect Sire... Averroes' books are safe l took a copy of each to Egypt Thank God That was a wise thing to do. Thank you May l tell him? We set off in an hour l won't be long Will you restore him his honors? l accused him of treason. Shall l contradict myself now? What made you fall into your own trap? Vanity The books! They're safe! Sarah, Manuela, his books are safe in Egypt! That's Aunt Zeinab! Move away! We have to congratulate him! - l'll marry you when l come back - No, now! Wait l'll be back Just a moment Thank you Thank you A thousand thanks.. ldeas have wings. No one can stop their flight
