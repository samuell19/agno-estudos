[rain pattering] [tense music] [thunder rumbling] [tense electronic music] [birds chirping] ["Dissolution" by The Image of All] But you're not gonna believe what happens after that. LUKE: Come on, Max. No, I swear to God, it's totally true. Can I get you folks something with your coffee? Our famous pecan pie is on special at only $1.99. I think we're good, thanks. That pecan pie sure does sound good though. [Lauren laughing] So anyway, this guy thinks it's all over, but he never developed the picture. When he finally does, the ghost is right in there right next to her. It was in the house all along. That's bullshit. It's totally true, my cousin's neighbor knew the actual guy it happened to back in Jersey. Swear to God. I gotta go to the restroom. Do you need this? No, I don't. Do you have a restroom? Just down there to the left. You're scaring Holly with those stupid ghost stories. They're not stories, man. This kind of stuff happens all the time. You just don't hear about it. Ghosts, demons, possessions. Yeah, then how is it that you're the only one talking about it? Are you dumb? Government keep a lid on it to keep people in line. Anyway, your little sister's got worse things to be scared of than ghosts. If I'd have known how monumentally fucked up she was... What? Jesus Christ, she almost died last night. We're not equipped for that. Look, she'll be fine once we get to I.A. That's the plan, isn't it? Get her to California. Lauren's idea. My sister and her boyfriend moved out there last year. They got all the treatment you want, you don't even have to register or say your name or anything. They hand out that shit like candy in Cali. We'd get there quicker if we didn't keep stopping in all these stupid places. Hey, these places is what's gonna pay for our summer, Luke. Look, a couple more of these and we'll be fixed up till September. Come on, guys, it's gonna be lit, Cali sunshine instead of freezing our balls off back East, what's not to like? Okay, so we're good to go? Same as last time. Luke, you're on the door, nobody gets in or out until we're done. Lauren, register, Holly, you just do whatever. Okay? [loud rock music] Everybody be calm, this is a robbery! Nobody do anything stupid and this will all be over before you can say, make America great again. Open the register! MAX: Do it! I'm done. Right, we're outta here. You people better not even dream about calling the cops. We won't. That ain't the way we do things round here, honey. Go, go, go! [rock music continues] Jesus, come on! Holly, you okay? Just fucking drive, man! [gun fires] Was that a gunshot? Drive! [engine revs] What are you lookin' at? [birds chirping] Shit, I told you that was a gunshot. Look at that, it's gone right through the radiator. Okay, look, can you fix it? Are you kidding? On the side of the road? It took my dad years to find all the parts for this. It's a classic. So, what are you gonna do? 'Cause I'm not about to wait here and get my ass shot off by them hicks coming from the diner for their money. Look, if we had water, I can refill the radiator. It's just gonna leak out again, but if we start with it cool, we can make it a few more miles. Then we do it again, let it cool, fill it up, a few more miles. We could make the next town at least. Yeah, great plan. Except we don't have any water and we're in the middle of fucking nowhere. Unless you want to go back to the diner and ask them to use their faucet. I saw a house back there. Out here, you sure? I didn't see no house. It was kind of weird-looking. I saw it through the trees. Is she seeing things again? 'Cause I am not about to go searching the forest for some non-existent house your sister dreamed up. I saw it too. How far back was it? Not far, a couple of minutes. Okay, fine, let's move. [tense music] [phone ringing] Halsey family residence. Daddy? You are not gonna believe what just happened. [birds chirping] Oh, sweet Jesus, this is what you call a house? You kids must've had it harder than I thought. Well, we just need is a working faucet. Well, that'd be a miracle, whole place looks like it's about to fucking fall down. Lauren, go knock on the door. Why me? Because if there's some old grandma living there, she's sure as hell not gonna open the door for someone like me. You really think there's gonna be anyone in there? How the fuck should I know? Just trying to do things the smart way. [tense music] We need something to carry the water in. Bottles, cans, whatever you can find. I'll let you know if I see anything. [eerie music] [knocking on door] Hello? Okay, let's do this. You okay? Not bad, not a bad hideout, what do you say? I thought we were in a hurry to get to I.A.? Well, plans can change. I don't know, I kinda like the place. What about getting your ass shot off? No, we can defend the place, hole it up, fight 'em off like in the movies! [Max mimics gun firing] [Holly gasping] Shh, it's okay. Oh man, here we go again. Laurs, me and you go to the kitchen and find some water. I'm staying with Holly. Yeah, I figured as much. [tense music] I found a faucet! Open it up. [Max sighs] Tea pots, tea cups, more tea cups. Damn, you think the people who own this place are British? You okay? My arms hurt. Okay. And my legs hurt. Right. Everything fucking hurts. Okay. It used to feel good, when I would inject. Really fucking good. Made me forget about everything, all the shit we were going through. Now, I have to do it just to feel normal. It'll be fine once we get to I.A. That's a nice dream. It's not a dream, we'll make it. I don't trust Max. You shouldn't either. What about Lauren? She's okay. She likes you. What do you mean? What I say, a girl can tell. Do you like her? I don't know, I never met her before this. Thought she was into Max. No, he has a tiny dick, she told me. Must be why he's mad all the time. Rock and roll! We make a pretty good team, don't we? I guess. Hey, we could be like the next Bonnie and Clyde, you know? Who's that? You never heard of Bonnie and Clyde? You never seen the movie? Must've missed it. Hey, look I'm just saying, like, it would be pretty cool, like the two of us, we could just take off, do whatever we want. How many gas stations and diners do you think there are between here and I.A.? It doesn't take more than two of us to rip one of those places off. So, what are you saying? Look, I'm just saying, sometimes it feels like we're carrying a bit of extra weight. It's Luke's car. No, no, it's his dad's car. Whatever, can't make a road trip without a car. Shit, look at this. We could buy two fucking cars with this money if we didn't have to split it four ways. Four ways? You're splitting it with Holly? Luke wouldn't bring the car if I didn't. He wouldn't have come at all if you didn't spin him that bullshit about the rehab center. No, it's not bullshit. They got my sister's boyfriend off heroin out there, and he has been clean for six months now. Oh, whatever. [tense music] I really need some, Luke. Sure, okay. There's not much left after last night. That's okay, I'm trying to cut down anyway. [Holly groans] Where are you going? I'm gonna go find some place quiet. I'll go with you. I don't want you to. I'm not a kid anymore, Luke. [scoffs] I know, I just think someone should go with you in case something happens. There's not enough left in there to O.D. on, if that's what you mean? Look, I know you only look out for me because you feel guilty, but you don't have to. What happened, it wasn't your fault. Look, it's safer if I'm with you. We don't this place, what if someone... I don't want you there, don't you get it? I hate doing this in front of you. What? Why? Because I'm fucking ashamed of it, that's why. I'm such a fucking failure next to you. What do you mean, next to me? I haven't been through what you have, there's no comparison. You have, and you were hurt by it too. You just deal with it better than I do. Maybe. We're just different people I guess. I don't wanna lose you. I don't have anybody else. You won't. Not ever. I'm gonna go find somewhere quiet to do this. [dramatic music] Hey. You can see me? Sure, what's up? You been smoking something? What? What are you doing here? I noticed you had candles. Can I use one? You are welcome to make use of the candle, but please don't move it out of position. I must have a candle burning at each point of the pentagram. It protects the sanctity of the space. You're really into this stuff, huh? You could say that, yes. You sure you're not high? You're talking kinda weird. You mean my accent? Oh, is that what it is? I'm English. Thought you were high. MAN: What's your name? Holly. My name's Oliver. I'm very pleased to meet you, Holly. [Holly screams] Holly? [Holly whimpering] What are you doing? Don't struggle. LUKE: Holly? [tense music] I'm afraid you're cursed now, as am I. The symbol on your arm is to remind you. It's the price you pay for entering into the pentagram. But soon you'll be free of your pain. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. I offer this gift to you in the full knowledge of its cost which I bear with my heart and my mind from this day forward. Get away from her! I'm afraid that's not possible. Holly and I have to stay exactly where we are. What is this? A simple ritual. Some spoken words, the spilling of blood in a pentagram. You hurt her and you're dead! That's where you're wrong. I hurt her and I live. [footsteps rapidly approaching] You got ten seconds to drop the knife and back away from the girl. I take it you're the man in charge here. In this fucking room, I am, yes. Well, I like your spirit, but you're going about this all the wrong way, but I'm sure you know that. A girl like this? 10 a penny on any city street. What are you talking about? I'm talking about worth. I'm talking about value. To you, she's worth nothing. A drugged up whore. But to me, in here, she's priceless. And I'm willing to share the value with you. Don't listen to him. He's not making any sense. It makes perfect sense to those that are willing to listen. To those that know what they want in life and aren't afraid to reach out and take it. Am I right? What do you mean by value? It's quite simple. A ritual has begun, a ritual that requires a sacrifice. And what's in return? Ah, so you understand the concept? Yeah, yeah, I get it. I heard about this shit. You sacrifice someone, you get something in return. What is it? Power, the greatest power you can imagine. And it's all right here. The words, the ritual, the rewards. Let me see that. [Luke grunts] [Holly whimpering] [Lauren gasps] [sizzle sounds] [Luke, Max, and Lauren gasping] [Lauren whimpers] What is this, why do we all have it? It's the price you pay for stepping inside the pentagram. You should have listened to me when you had a chance. You're now all cursed, all of you, just like I am. Cursed with what? A ritual was started. A ritual requiring a sacrifice. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. I offer this gift to you in full knowledge of its cost, which I will bear with my heart and mind from this day forward. [thunder crashing] In exchange, I only seek enlightenment and the strength to carry out your work here on Earth. Give me power, great one, to use in your name. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. NATALIE: [gasps] What are you doing? Don't step outside the pentagram! [sizzle sound] - [Natalie cries] - [Oliver gasps] What the hell is this? Dear God, what have you done? You've cursed the both of us. Get back in there with me, it's the only safe place now. Screw you, Oliver! Come back! [rattling and clinking] [Natalie screams] [Oliver screams] Inside the perimeter, it cannot see you, it cannot hear you, but you step outside. How about we just sacrifice your punk ass now? Nice try, good thinking. I knew you were a kindred spirit. But it won't work, I'm afraid. My soul has long since been bargained away. Yo, my man. You better start talking some sense real quick. Go ahead, fire, at least I'll be at peace. What happens if you step outside the pentagram? Is it worse than getting your head shot off? Wait, let me explain. We're all in this together. It's watching. It's listening. You're telling me this thing can see us? Not inside the pentagram. But if we step out. So, we're trapped inside this fucking circle? Yes. Bullshit, prove it! Why don't you prove it? Take a walk. See what happens. No, no, no, no, you take a walk. [Oliver groans] [Oliver groans] [rattling and clinking] Dear God. What is it? What's happening? He's coming for me. What is? I told you, you didn't believe me, but I told you. Now, you'll see. Jesus Christ, what is that? Now, you'll see what happens when a soul is promised and not delivered! [Oliver screaming] [birds chirping] LAUREN: Ever hear of anything like this? Not exactly. [Holly whimpering] Knew a girl once, her creepy boyfriend was into it, but. What happened? She wound up dead. He's doing a 20 stretch. They found pieces of her body scattered across the neighborhood. Jesus, don't any of your stories have a happy ending? [Holly whimpering] Holly, you okay? I need it, Luke. Okay. [tense music] Shit! Look at me, you have to be strong, honey, okay? I'm gonna figure a way out of this. I mean, this is some seriously dark shit. If that guy couldn't figure a way out, how the hell are we gonna do it? We could call someone. Oh, call someone. If we had to. What, like 911? If we had to! No fucking way. I just mean if we had to! Are you dumb? That is the stupidest thing I ever heard. What are you gonna do, call and ask to speak to the black magic department? We're not calling 911 no matter what happens, you hear me? All right, forget it! Can you believe this guy? I'm stood here with $4,000 in stolen cash and an unregistered gun, and this asshat wants to call the cops! I said forget it, all right? Will you guys just stop fighting, huh? Maybe there is a way out. If you guys just stop yelling at each other. [tense music] Well, this is pretty cool. You know, I was gonna get some ink when we got to I.A., but, what's this thing called again, an Instagram? Pentagram. You know what, I think I'll keep it as a souvenir. Remind me how good this fucking lousy road trip was. He said it's a sign. To remind us we're all cursed. So if it's gone, it means the curse is gone? I don't know, I guess. I wonder how long it takes for something like this to fade? I have a lot of scars. They never really go away. Cold? [tense music] Me too. [glass clinking] Hey, do you hear that? Is it that thing? It's coming back. We didn't step out of the pentagram! We didn't fucking do anything, do you hear me? I must have a candle burning at each point of the pentagram. It protects the sanctity of the space. Candles, they have to be burning to make it safe. There, hey, anybody got a light? [Lauren panting] [ghostly whispers] Lighter's dead! I'm done! [rattling and clinking] [whispers intensify] It didn't work! Put it back! There has to be one at every point. [whispers and clinking stop] [Holly whimpers] Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. It's okay, it's okay, it's okay, it's okay. - It's okay. - [Holly sobbing] Hey, hey, you know it's a good thing you knew what to do just now. What? Anything else you want to share with us? Any other rules you know about that maybe we oughta hear? Leave her alone, Max. Can't you see she's sick? Oh, I know what she is. She's a... She's a what? Shh, it's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna think of something. Did he say step out of the pentagram? What? We can't step out, but do you think we can reach out? Like, if we didn't touch the ground? What are you talking about? Just thinking out loud. [tense music] [Luke grunting] Give me your hand. What? Just give me your hand! [Luke grunts] Yo, bro, I didn't sign up for this, man. I'm sorry. I'm almost there. Lauren, grab my arm! You're pulling my fucking arm out! I've almost got it! [Max shouts] Oh, fuck it, I can't pull me up! [Luke gasping] I almost had it. Hey, don't you ever pull a stunt like that again, huh? You wanna take your own life, fine, but don't fucking pull me out with you! But I was so close! She's not worth it. What? You heard what I said. Hmm, take a look at her. She'll be dead by the end of the night. And I'm not gonna risk my life for that. Fine. Don't. 911, emergency. Don't make me do this. Yeah, I need a medic. My sister's going into withdrawal. No! Give me the cell phone. [tense music] Sorry, false alarm. We're fine. Yeah, just like I thought. [somber music] Sorry. I was so close. Listen, maybe Max is right. Well, kinda. I mean, I get it, I got a sister too. I'd want to help her if I could. You don't understand. I'd risk my life for her every day if I had to. It's the least I can do. I was so close. The bag, give me the bag. What do you want it for? Jesus Christ, Max, I don't want the money, I just need the bag. Can I have the bag? Your funeral. [tense music] You almost had it. [Luke sighs] [Holly whimpers] It's coming, Holly, it's coming. [Luke panting] Yes! Laurs, look at this. These two, I'm telling you, dead weights. So what, you got a way out of here? Maybe, yeah, maybe I have. Congrats, bro. Holly lives to die another day. Just what is your problem, Max? Look around you, that's my fucking problem. We're all in this together. I mean, why are we even in this thing? You know, who went into the pentagram first? We spend half our time searching for drug dealers who aren't DEA agents and now this. It's not her fault. You're the one who said we should get to California. I thought that was the whole plan. Well, plans change. I guess so. Well, look, I'm just saying, some of us are looking at the odds of all of us getting out. And it ain't looking so good for some of us. Max. Max. I think we've got a problem. We're meant to have five burning candles, right? One on each point. So what? Well, look, look at these fucking candles. There's almost nothing left. Hey, hey, what are you doing? Jesus, Max, back off! I'm just using the flashlight. I knew it, there's more candles over there. MAX: Too far. We can use the bag. They're too fucking far. You're a genius! This is so retarded. You do it, I don't wanna screw it up. Which one am I going for? Uh, that one. Retarded. Nice going, that was the closest one. Just needs to be a little longer, that's all. Here, hold this. Hold that. [suspenseful music] LAUREN: I think that one's closest now. Yes! No, Lauren, give me the light. What happened? The candle, you blew it out you dick! [rattling and clinking] Come on, give me the light! Give me that! [ghostly whispers] [ghostly whispers and rattling stop] I think it's gonna work. Try that one. Max, you might want to shield that candle just in case. No shit, Einstein. [Luke grunts] [Luke groans] Jesus, we're gonna need five of these things. It's gonna take forever. Do you have some place you need to be? Yes! [Laughs] Come on, can we pace this up? It's not gonna reach any of them. I still don't think it's gonna reach. I will, if you will. Do you two have any idea how fucking ridiculous you look? We're all about to die and you're both busy playing "you show me yours." What's wrong, Max? Too shy to help out? Yeah, I got my own job to do. Use the flashlight again. There, there. I'm gonna go for the double hit, okay? Okay. [suspenseful music] [Luke and Lauren grunting] Yes! [Laughs] Get a move on, that candle's fucking dying. Let's bring 'em in. This one's not gonna last long. Okay, quick, just one more time. Do you think it's gonna be long enough? I think so. Hey, yo, yo, yo, yo. That is the last candle, dog, be careful. That's it, we're fucked. You've fucking killed us. [suspenseful music] [rattling and clinking] Look! It's coming! Your fucking retarded plan has fucking killed us! Shut up and let me think! [ghostly whispering] [whispering subsides] [Luke panting] Holly always carries one just in case. We did it, Lauren. We did all five. [tense music] Max, tell us about that guy. The devil-worshiper. You don't wanna hear that. Might as well talk about something. What is this, fucking campfire stories? Oh what, you want us to say please? [Max sighs] Well, look, I don't know all the details like I said, but I knew this girl, Sandy. She was mixed up with this guy, real creepy fucker, metal pole stuck through his face, serious Hellraiser stuff. So anyway, he and Shirley get a place together... I thought her name was Sandy. Shirley, I said Shirley. Anyway, they get a place together in Queens. I never saw it myself but my cousin went there, said it was real fucked up. How come it's always your cousin? My cousin knew the guy, my cousin went there once. I got a lot of cousins, so what? So anyway, pretty soon the neighbors started to give the landlord hell because of the stink, and this guy stopped answering his doorbell, so, after a while the cops busted down the door. Don't tell me, they found her body inside. No. It was chickens. What? This guy, he was only getting live fucking chickens. They were getting them from the Chinese restaurant down the block. And he was smuggling them in and cutting their fucking heads off in the apartment, like some kind of ritual shit, a sacrifice. And then, he was fucking them in the neck, can you believe that shit? While they were still running around alive with no head. Thought it was gonna boost his ying yang, you know, like a sex thing. So, the whole place was stinking of fucking chicken bones. You said he killed Sandy. See, I never said that. That was the guy from the Chinese restaurant, cut her up with a big meat cleaver from the kitchen. Turns out she was screwing him on the side, and then he found out she was also fucking the creepy dude and went mad crazy on her, but, well, that's a whole nother story. The point is, never fuck with a Chinaman who works with a meat cleaver. But I thought the creepy guy was doing 20 years? No, look, after they threw out all the dead chickens, they found a purse this guy stole from some old lady. Turns out, she died from shock two weeks after the robbery. They got him on second degree homicide. Crazy, huh? So... What did the devil-worshiping have to do with this? Nothing. They're just the only two people I knew who were into it, that's all. [insects chirping] [eerie music] Power, the greatest power you can imagine. And it's all right here. The words, the ritual, the rewards. [dramatic music] Bingo. [tense music] Hey bro, time to wake up, bro. Nah, you can have an extra hour. Shh. What is it? It's time. Time for what? Time to do what we gotta do to get out of here. LAUREN: Luke! No, no, he's okay. I just had to make sure he didn't wake up too soon. Too soon for what? I sat here and waited while he fixed up his sister and you two fooled around with candles. Where did it get us? We're right back to where we started. It bought us more time. Time? What use is time if we're sat here pissing it away? [solemn music] There's only one way to get out of this thing, and we both know what it is. That British guy, he told us right from the start. Say the words, spill the blood, make the sacrifice, complete the ritual. But we don't know anything about that. It's all in here, he said it, remember? He even marked the page. Everything we need to complete the ritual is right here. There is nothing stopping us from ending this thing right now and getting the fuck out of here. I mean, look at this. Look, she's half-dead anyway. I mean, how long do you think she's even got? You know, I don't like it any more than you do, but somebody's got to make the tough decisions. Somebody's got to have the balls to step to the plate and do what we gotta do to get out of here. Unless you want to spend the rest of your life stuck in this fucking circle? No. Good. Let's get started. You with me on this? [tense music] Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear... Wait, will you wait a second? Okay. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. I offer this gift to you in full knowledge of its cost, which I will bear with my heart and mind from this day forward. In exchange, I seek only enlightenment and the strength to carry out your work here on Earth. Give me power, oh great one, to use your name. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. What are you doing? I'm making a sacrifice. But I thought... What? This isn't what we said. I thought that you... I thought you were talking about Holly. What's the difference? I already told you these two are dead weights. We don't need 'em, either of 'em. - But I... - Jesus, Lauren, what do you care anyway? Unless you do care. Is that it? It matters, okay? You said that Holly was gonna die anyway. Well, plans change. If I took out Holly, what do you think would happen? What do you think big brother would do when he wakes up? He's gonna take out my head, either in here or outside. But you can't just kill him. This is the only way, Lauren. Don't you get it? This is our only chance. But... I... What do you want? That's what it all comes down to. What, you want? Me, money, freedom, or do you wanna stay in this circle with these fucking losers? [solemn music] Huh. You choose him. No, no, no. I, I would... Fine. Fuck you too. [gun fires] [Lauren chokes] [Lauren panting] Go on, take her motherfucker! Take her, I fucking killed her, take her! What the fuck, I said your words, I spilled her fucking blood, I sacrificed her, now why am I still fucking cursed? HOLLY: You did it wrong, Max. What did you say? You did it wrong. Say the words, spill with blood, all within the pentagram, that's what he said. It doesn't work if she dies outside the pentagram, Max. Yeah, that's right, I forgot. You know all the rules, don't you? Well, I'll bear that in mind, Holly. Do it. I don't care. I'll sit here and I'll let it happen. Just promise me one thing. And what's that? Don't fuck it up. And make sure Luke gets out too. Uh-uh. See, I can't make that promise 'cause you know as well as I do that your big brother will chase me down to the ends of the Earth. I got two bullets left in this bad boy, and I'm gonna give that old demon a "two for the price of one." [dramatic music] Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. I offer this gift to you in full knowledge of its cost, which I will bear with my heart and my mind from this day forward. In exchange, I seek only enlightenment and the strength to carry out your work here on Earth. Give me power, great one, to use in your name. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. [Max and Luke grunting] [gun firing] Take a walk, Max. [dramatic music] [rattling and clinking] No, no, no, no. Fuck. I won't give you the satisfaction, motherfucker! Fuck, fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck! Fuck, fuck. [ghostly whispering] [Max screaming] [birds chirping] Is this their car? Yup, recognize it anywhere. Ain't much around here. Where do you think they got to? Can't be far if they're on foot. [tense music] You know, I really thought we were gonna make it. To I.A., I mean. It doesn't matter where you go, New York, I.A. You take your problems with you. You were right. I should never have trusted Max. You were always too trusting. You trusted me every time I said I was gonna go out and buy cigarettes. I don't even smoke. I guess it was easier to lie to myself than to admit the truth. I did some really bad stuff, Luke. I know. I stole from people. And I screwed some, some really disgusting guys. I know. It's okay. I just need to let it out sometimes. And now I'm running out of time. We both are. At least we'll die together. Don't say that. There's a way out of this and you know it, you've always known it. What are you talking about? You do what Oliver wanted to do. What Max was trying to do. You finish the ritual, you make the sacrifice. No. - What if I wanted you to? - No. How long do you think I have? In here or anywhere? Don't say that. If not for you, I would have been dead in a dumpster a long time ago. Now, I can make it right. You don't owe me anything. After what my dad did to you, I owe you more than I can ever pay back. You don't. It wasn't your fault what happened. You can't blame yourself. I should have seen it. I could've stopped it. Luke, get real. Face it, my mom was a desperate slut just like your dad was an abusive asshole. It was their choice to get hitched and they deserved each other. Me and you, we just got caught up in the middle. She didn't deserve to die just 'cause he was too drunk to know when to stop hitting her. She made her own choices, same as I did. I should've seen it. I should have seen what he was doing to you. You know what I remember the most? The smell of smoke on his hands, and on his breath. The whole fucking house smelled of it once he moved in. That's why I never smoked cigarettes. Why think about it? Don't you? All the time. [solemn music] Remember that time, that time I got hit by that car, and you drove me to the hospital? Sure. It wasn't an accident. What? I just closed my eyes and stepped into the ongoing traffic. Why? He was already in jail by then. I thought, I thought everybody would be better off without me, especially you. That's not true. It is now. What are you saying? I've been killing myself for years, Luke. Now, maybe it's finally worth something. This is the knife he was gonna use. I don't want that. And you have to say the words, the words in the book. I don't want that, Holly. Then what? Think you're gonna be a hero? Dying here with me when you could've gotten out? You're not. It's fucking stupid. But I can't do it. You can, you have to. I'm in pain, Luke. I'm in pain every day of my life, and I can't take it anymore. Please, you have to say the words, the words in the book, that's what he said, say the words, spill the blood, all within the pentagram. - I... - I need you to do it. I want you to do it. [Luke panting] [tense music] Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. I offer this gift to you in full knowledge of its cost, which I will bear with my heart and mind from this day forward. In exchange, I seek only enlightenment, and the strength to carry out your work here on Earth. Give me power, oh great one, to use in your name. Asmodeus, lord of despair, prince of darkness, hear my prayer. Do it. Set us both free. [Luke panting] [gun fires] [dramatic music] What the holy hell has been going on here? [Holly panting] HOLLY: He's dead! Are you okay, Missy? He's dead! Well, I couldn't figure out any other way to stop him from doing what he was gonna do. [Holly whimpers] I'm free. What say? I'm free, I'm free! Well, I'm not too sure about that, Missy. You sure these are the two that did it? Yeah, that girl was one of 'em too. Well, ain't that a son of a bitch, Missy? You thought you were free, and you ain't free at all. You goddamn city punks. You think I haven't seen all this before, huh? You come into our nice little town with your drugs and your stealin'. Please, I'm sorry. You can call the cops. Like I told your friend, honey, that ain't how we do things round here. The cops? All the cops want to do is uphold the law. But the law? Well, that don't mean justice. What do you want? What do you think, Jayney? You think anybody on God's earth is gonna miss this scrawny little whore? I surely wouldn't miss her. I think that crime deserves a sentence, and, well, it just happens that we have a little cell that you could do your time in. How long do you think that should be, Jayney? For armed robbery? 10 years I reckon. Damn, I'm not sure she'd make it, especially considering all of the punishment drills that I've got in mind for her. Now, come on, miss. Let's go. Daddy, wait. Is that our money over there? Some of it's yours, I guess. Well, it's all ours, now. [Jayney and Mr. Halsey gasp] [sizzle sound] What in God's name is this? I guess you're just gonna have to figure that out, same as we did.
