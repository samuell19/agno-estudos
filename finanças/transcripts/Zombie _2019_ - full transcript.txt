Don't know what is he doing? He said about timing. Where is Philips? I'm Kanchana, coming to play. Where are you going like Kanchana 5 sequel? Somehow, save me. What are you doing? Go that way. Don't know where I'm going? It's heard. Hello, sir! He has given the signal. Heard the bell sound. Nothing. It's heard well. Didn't put anything inside. Is that sound? Put in silent mode and come. Hey, you... Even when disguised as Zombie, you go behind her. Is it fair? Be careful. Definitely, it's the signal of Philips. Let's follow the Zombies. Come on. Follow the Zombie walk. Hurry up, come on. Don't overtake the Zombie, in hurry. Hey, come soon. Oh, no! Philips is no more I think. Let him die. We'll escape. Are you sure he won't come out? It's confirmed, he is dead.

I too thought the same. Whom are you teasing? I'll ruin you. Sir! It'll be a big problem if we speak here. Let's go out and speak. Brother! It seems to be wrong when looking at this place and these people. I don't think so. If it's wrong to you, shut up and get lost. We're doing right. Okay, brother. -Go away. Leave it, brother. Sir, let's leave this place, immediately. Zombies are here. -Yes, sir. Zombie? What's that? That must be a name of the dog. Look here, 'Big Boss Babe'... Any dog will run away if heard my name 'Pistol Raj' This dog is nothing. Ask it to come before me, if dare enough. Get dry biscuits for the dog. -I don't have money. It's not lucky enough to eat the dry biscuits. Ask it to come. Sir, a Zombie is the mixing of a human and an animal. If it bites us, we too... Who has locked the door? Let me see, open the door. -Listen me, What? A Zombie is here. Run away. Who is he? Looking like a partially molested victim. You're scaring me saying as Zombie. Who is the Zombie? Ask him to come. Uninitiated fools. Do you know what a Zombie bite is? It'll make you half dead. You'll become parasites. You fools! You've no idea what blood sucking parasites are? Hey, you bulb faced... He is the only guy, yelled me in all the languages. I'll shoot him, first. Get it. Don't shoot high and be fooled. Shoot down. Thank you. First shot. Fire, gun, Zombie, bullet... -She is very much afraid. What to do? Yes. What is he? I don't have the mind to shoot him? Hey, why are you roaming with this attire? Philips, don't you have? Who is that knocking? Go and open the door. Brother, you're the don. Go and ask him. Why? If the zombie attacks me, you want to enjoy. Shut up and go... No, brother. As you're the don, It'll be great, if you go. Whatever I do, will be fun. I'll go, brother. -Dude, listen me. You shouldn't go. Be quiet. Snehan, go... Either you go... Brother, atleast you go and open the door. Brother, they won't do. I'll open it. Dude, listen me, you're the only son. -Hey, take off your hand. Is it a 'Chandramuki' door? Can't it be opened? I'm going. Hey, dear! -No! When they're hesitating to open it's better if you think. Brother, I'll open it. Hey, don't go... Come back. Don't knock. I'm coming. Brother, babes are inside. -Is it? All roaming with cake applied on their faces. Open it, let's see. Look now, the hunter is coming! Oh, no! Brother! Brother, save him. Shoot now. Don't I shoot If there is bullet? It's biting the neck. Is this the Zombie? Come, let's escape. I can't. Shoot with your pistol and save us. We can't bear. The pistol himself is trembling. Don't keep talking. Do something. He tracked the phone But didn't track the presence of the Zombie. They flipped him and bite all around. It's coming. Come on. Run away. Take me too. Oh,gosh! Isn't there anyone to save me? Boss! Come on! -Thanks! They've trapped me! Leave me! Hey, traitor! Half cooked idiot! Poisonous animal! Kattapa's backstabber! Get spoilt. Take your hands off. Do you've sense? You're opening the locked door. I'll bang him, now. Hey, you're talking disrespectfully. -Just irritating Hey, I'm the don! Don! You nut... Hey, If you've heed us, we'd have given respect to you. Hey? We're trapped by the Zombies. We were planning to escape, but you intruded... Speak respectly. I'm pitiful. Are you going to die for the sake of the phone? Either you by-heart or leave it. You can spit on my face. But save me from the Zombie. Philips, if you save me, I'll work for you. No need. No need. -No. Am I so cheap? Just shut up. We can't work out anything, now. Only the old plan can be implemented. Old plan? Yes. Yes, the old plan. Is this? I haven't played this role. Okay, to escape I've to do anything. I'm ready. Philips, will you dress me up with petticoat? Looks like Nayanthara's attire. How do you wear all these and go around? That's why, I'm wearing the shorts. The costume is okay. But why are you having a bag? That attire was the other hero's. If I don't return it. he will thrash me. Philips! You must save us at the exact time. You know the time, right? My time is exact. Check your's. -It's Baba mudra! He'll save all of us. Guys, Come, let's go. Let' be serious. Let's go, dear. -Go... Is this the zombie sound -Go away. Okay, why are you asking me to go forward? You're the reason for everything. It's you opened the door. Go... We'll get caught as a clan. -Go... Go away. I'll smash you. Our guy! Don't anyone know to escape? His teeth is full of blood wonder, what he bite? Pistol brother, -What? Don't mess up. -Where to go? Again the same performance. Won't they get tired? Normally, he will roam like a zombie Leave me.

They're chasing us. Oh, no! Run away. -Run. Don't know where Philips went. It's my assistant who is coming first. Come soon. Hide safely. Oh, god! Good! They didn' see us. Hey, why did you shout? He just dragged your attire. Just remove aside. You know it, right? I might've ashamed if he dragged my attire. Atleast, I screamed to save myself. Don't know for what he is screaming, crazily. You goof, don't know how to wear a petticoat? You're not a don. You're gone! I'm an IT employee, even I can't understand what you scold. How can he understand who studied fifth grade? I didn't write the exam. Is that more important now? Only he lost his attire. But it came to slit my windpipe(sangu). I want to know what's 'windpipe' (sangu)? Oh, god! Just shut up. Hey, where did you get him? It was missed at the right time. Because of you, the whole plan was flopped. Because of whom? You are blaming me for everything. The drunkard said he'll come at the right time to save us. Who knows, where is he now? Even zombie will not scream like this. What's this? Wait... wait... It's heard, here. Yes. -Come, let's go and see. Who is he? I won't work listening to mind. But, work listening tom heart. I'm speaking to you more for an hour. Do you hear me? Why is he creating ruckus with Buddha? Didn't you go from there? How can I come at the right time without boozing? Why are you speaking to him? Chase him away. Brain fire. Come here. What's this? Bloody. Cockroach smell. You're local!
