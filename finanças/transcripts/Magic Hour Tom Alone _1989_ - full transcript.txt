[music playing] Well, I guess that's it. If we just had one more week. A storm hits when it hits, Tom. No point getting mad at it. We'll never come back here! I love it, too. You know that. 15 year's a long time. I-- I don't want to live in town. Might not be so bad. You'll make some new friends. It's not forever. Plenty of prime farmland out west. That's where we're going. Yeah, I know, but when? Soon as we've saved enough. Couple of years at most. Two years! Now, we got a plan, Tom. That's the main thing. It's not going to be easy, but we'll do it as long as we all stick together. Leaving is the worst part of it. You've got to help me now, Son. All ready to go. [music playing] Coming, Tom? Yeah, I'm with you. [dog whines] Come on, Jake. Come on. Come on, Jake. Good boy. [horse snorts and wagon creaks] [theme music] Hyah! [hooves clopping] Whoa, whoa, whoa there, boy. Whoa. [horse snorts] [city sounds and chatter] Jake. Come on, Jake. McGee, your pay. [cash register clatter] Tom. Thank you, sir. [coins jingle] Get off home, two of you! [door jingles open] (WHISPERING) Quiet, Jake! Get out of here! Go, Jake! Down! Come on, let's go! [dog barks] Careful there, you young boys. [dog whines] Prime pork chops, my lord. Good job, Buggy, my good man. Grandpa Craig's come for supper. You're to fetch Pa home. He won't come, and I won't neither. That mean old geezer hates us both. (IMITATING GRANDPA) That boy's headed for jail, Clara. Here. [dog whining] Here, here, these'll make Ma happy. She'll know you scooped them. Get along, Sarah. Uh, tell her I'm working late. She won't believe it! Come on, Jake. Let's go home. [machinery whirring] McDougall nearly caught us that time. So what? You want to sweep his floors for the rest of your life? BOTH: Through light and dark, blood and fire, death and damnation, the day I break this oath of blood, I die a traitor's death. [whoosh of furnace] Tom! Pa ain't here. Ain't coming back, neither. Yeah, he said he was going to quit. Tom! Tom! He didn't quit. Boss Mordell wants more work for less money. Gordon mouthed off at him, got himself fired for it. Your pa's gone to the Black Bull, looking for Mordell. Figures his shift's owed back pay, which say are, but sometimes it's better to keep your mouth shut, you know. Hey, my pa can whip any man in this town. He's not scared of Mordell. Come on. [music playing] [chatter] Hmm. You're staring like a mad thing, Bradshaw. What's your problem? These men here got some back pay coming, Mordell. [laughs] Back pay, is it now? You know, why don't you look in your pocket there, Mordell? Willie Davis, who never did his own work, bought his own liquor, or fought his own fights. You'll take that back you will. Haha! There's four of us here, got a week's money owing. You pay up, and that's the end of it. It says here that you'll all paid up to date. That's a lie! That's right, that's a lie. CROWD: Yeah, that's right. Mordell's got [inaudible] Too hot, Bradshaw. Have a drink on me and, uh, run home to your wife. [liquor splashes] CROWD: Whoa! [crowd exclaims] Way to go, Gordy! CROWD: Come on, boys, let's get him! Come on! Yeehaw! Woo! [glass clatters and breaks] Leave my dad alone! CROWD: Where'd that kid come from? Watch it, watch it! [glass breaks] CROWD: Hold it! Hold it! Hit him again, Gordy! Finish him off! Whoo! [thud] [knife crunches into man] - Ah! Ugh. MAN: Hey! Oh! [music playing] Tom! Go on home, boy. Do you hear me! Get out! MAN: Let's get out here! [crowd murmurs] [footsteps and door closing] We got to get out of here, Gord. Come on! [crickets chirping] [dog barking in distance] [exclaims] What am I doing? [panting] I got to go back. What, are you crazy? There's a-- There's a man back there with your knife in his gut! [boys panting] Now, I didn't kill him. You were all there, you saw. I couldn't-- I couldn't see nothing, but I'll say what you want. Yeah, we all will. You listen. Listen to me! I'd never kill a man. I know, Pa. I know it. Still is like to hang for it. [music playing] So at the end of it, Boss Mordell is dead, and Gordy ran for it. Surely you can't think-- It seems Gordy provoked the fight, and Mordell was killed with his knife. Gordon stands up for himself and other people, too. But he is not the man to be mixed up in murder. I hope not. Boss Mordell has powerful friends in this town. I'll send him over as soon as he comes home. He'll want this cleared up. All right, ma'am. Good night, Mrs Bradshaw. He didn't do it, Ma. I was there. [sighs] Where is he, Tom? [sniffle] [crickets and frogs] Shh! A change of clothes, a few dollars. There's-- Sarah, I want to tell you. There's no time to-- I'm staying. I won't run like a rat. I'm innocent, what can they do to me? Hang you, Gordon. They can hang you. Exactly what I was telling him. Where will you go? Brother Boyd's in Winnipeg. He'll find me a job. I'll save some money. Then we can move out west, just like we always planned. We didn't plan it this way. I'll send for you. Clara, it's going to work out, I promise. Clara, I love you. [horse whinnies] Don't you worry about your pa, boy. I'll stick with him. Please, Pa, I want to come with you. Look after your mother and your sister. But you always said that we would stick together. We will, Tom. We will, but right now, you got a job and so do I. Your job's to stay here and take care of things. I'm counting on you, Son. OK? [sighs] [knocking on door] Good evening, Mr Craig. Can we please have a word with you in private, if you don't mind? Come in, please. Oh, Mrs Bradshaw not here, sir? She hasn't run off if that's what you mean? Oh? Well, I'm sorry. This business is very painful, I'm sure, sir. I don't suppose you have any idea where the man might be hiding, sir. Well, it's a pity, because I don't see Gordy Bradshaw as a murdering type, but when he runs off like this. Well, I can't pretend that I've ever approved of my daughter's husband-- or liked him much. Hmm. Very well, I'll tell you. [door creaks] Now, Winnipeg, sir? His brother's name is Boyd. I-- I don't know the address. That's all I can tell you. Now, it's a start. Thank you, sir. I don't believe for a moment that Gordon did this terrible thing. But running off is no solution, sir. Exactly! He must clear his name. In a court of law, quite right. I must think of my daughter. Well, there's no need for Mrs Bradshaw to know the source of this information, sir. Under normal circumstances, I-- the fact is, Clara's expecting another child. Tom, we're going to be staying with Grandpa for a while. No! You don't-- no. What? Nothing. We don't have any choice. He said we have to get rid of Jake! We'll find a good home for him. I'm not going without Jake. Sarah, you've never said one good word about that dog. He may be a bad dog, but he's our dog. Hmm? All right, I'll go, but I'll hate it. Bed. [music playing] Come here. Good night. Good night, Ma. Grandpa hates Pa, and he hates me, and I hate him, the old buzzard. I won't listen to that kind of talk. It is kind of him to offer. I know how you feel, but you can't support the three of us. I'm telling you I won't go! There are other people in the world besides you, Tom. So you're on his side now? I bet you think Pa did it? You're always blaming him for everything. It wasn't his fault the farm went under. It was the storm. You think I don't know that! He worked day and night to get the crop in. So did I! [slap] [music playing] [crying] Ma? Don't you understand, Tom? That fall was our best time. It-- it darn near killed us. Yes, yes, we lost, but we fought. And we fought together. We were a family. And we will be again. [sniffles] (VOICEOVER) Dear Ma and Sarah, gone to find Pa, will be back soon. Love, Tom. Bye Sarah. [rooster crowing] Buggy, over here. Listen, we're getting out of here. I'm going to find my father and-- Whoa, whoa, hold up there. Hey, I've got it all planned. Train leaves at 8:00, and we'll be on it. Not me, Tom. Think about it, Buggy. The two of us, out on the bush, sleeping rough, panning for gold, doing just what we want. I can't. I just can't. [spits] You're just scared. Maybe I am. So what! Tom, Boss Mordell is dead. He's dead. It ain't no game! Don't you see? All I see is a scared little rat. I thought you were my friend. You don't think of anybody but yourself, do you? Tom, my pa's out of work. They need me at home. I just have run off and leave them. Here. Take this. I picked it up off that floor. It's Mordell's. I guess it's what's owing your pa. Take it. Take it. Good luck, Tom. I'm sorry. [footsteps away] [dog growling] [train whistle] [train bell] [brakes squeaking] [dog barking] [chatter of passengers] Oh Hillary, is that you? Oh, lovely to see you. How are you? Fine, nice to see you. Yes, Edward's just three months old now. TRAIN CONDUCTOR: All aboard, Winnipeg! All aboard! All aboard! Taking the train today, boy? Ye-- yes, sir, I am. Ah, Ah, beautiful day for it. Going far? Quite a way. I'm, uh, got a-- I've got an uncle in [inaudible] Oh here, let me help you. Uh, let me just check your ticket first. [music playing] I was just going to buy one. All right, let's go. You don't have a red cent, do you? [dog whining] [passenger chatter] Hey, constable. [dog barking] Jake! What are you doing here? Jake! [dog whining] That your dog, boy? No sir, not bit of it, sir. Liar. I'm calling the guard. No sir, please. I'll-- I'll pay for the bacon. [steam hisses] TRAIN CONDUCTOR: All aboard! [music playing] [birds chirping] [train whistle] [chatter] [train horn and bell sounding] Hello? Hello, ma'am We have fresh rolls today. Oh, no thank you. Just this. How much? Two cents. Great with some mustard, try it yourself, why don't you. Why, I don't mind if I do. There's one. Hi there, boy. Good boy. They call me Grubber, because I like to eat. And they call him Mouse. Because he's small? No, it's my name. Henry Mouse. Tom. You staying around here, Tom? Um, nah, moving on. Well, looks like it's suppertime, eh, Mousey boy? There's your man, Grubber. So long, Tom. Hey, well, wait up a minute. [bar chatter] GRUBBER: Winnipeg, huh? Long way. Oh yeah, my dad's there. He's got a good business going. So, uh, what line of work? You know, this and that. Set the money up for your trip, huh? Well, hello, boys. Buy us a drink, love? Oh, you get out of here. Come on, get out of it. I'll find some other company. So, uh, having a soft, are you? Not me, boyo. Riding the rail, that's my style. Sure, if you got no cash. Hey, why waste money when you can ride for free? Haha, smart! So I guess you'll be jumping the cut tonight, then? Uh, yeah, yeah, that's right. Well, you know, it's the best place-- He knows that. Hello, boys. Time to pay up. Pay up, then, Mousey. Well, you're holding this date, Grubs. No, I didn't. All right, come on, come on. What's up? Looks like Mousey here left our cash back home. Look, we'll settle tomorrow. Oh no. I'm calling the police. Hey, it's no problem. I'll cover it. Well, you're a gentleman. [train whistle] The trains slowest right here. If you run like mad-- What about the hound? He's a good jumper. He can jump. If-- if he doesn't make it-- Look, he'll make it, all right. Now, you run like heck, and I'll throw your pack-- Shh! OK. OK. [music playing] All right, there it is! Move! [dog barks] Bye! See you! Come again! Nice kid, but real stupid nice. BOTH: Haha! [dog whines] What the heck? Oh! You could say we did him a favor-- took his pack without, uh, without slitting his throat. You hungry, boy? Yeah, me too. We have nothing. And now way of getting nothing. [train slowing] [train horn sounds] [train bell rings] [dog whines] Right on time. Hey, [inaudible] over here! [dog barks] Jake, OK go. [music playing] Spare a few cents? Spare a few cents? [horse whinnies] [dog whines] Spare a few cents? A few cents? Spare a few cents, ma'am, a lad ain't ate for two days? Spare a few cents? [purse clinks] A thief! I've caught a thief! MAN: Hey you! Hey! Murder! Murder! Thief! Round the back! WOMAN: Thief! Murder! Murder! Got you! You ought you fetch a nice reward. MAN: Settle down, you thief. You ain't going nowhere. Back off! Stand back, you hear! That's him! I thought he'd kill me, him and that brute of a dog! I'm telling you, Gordie. You can't go wrong. Well, at least think about it. For the last time, I said, no. We've been doing everything your way. Where has it got us? Sleeping rough, starving half to death. If only we'd met my brother here-- Your brother's left town. Now, look, just think about it. I got it all worked out. Had your cries for help not been answered, you're sure he would have killed you where you stood? Yes. Is that everything, Miss Gray? Yes. Proud of yourself, boy? It wasn't like that. You calling the lady a liar? No, no, sir, but-- No buts! Not another word. Thank you, Miss Gray. That'll be all. Will I be called to the trial, then? We've just gone through an uprising, Miss Gray. The courts are too busy with the Riel's people to take time for this little weasel. [door shuts] [crickets chirping] [guards keys clatter] [cell door opens] On your feet, you've dried out. Hey! Is that for me, miss? What's your name? Tom-- Davis. Tom Davis. Well, you're a nice piece of work, aren't you, Tom Davis? Hey, whatever they say, I wouldn't bash a woman. Not anymore you won't. And I never did. She said so herself. It was more like she bashed me. [tray clatters] Didn't your ma teach you any manners? Hey, my mother's got nothing to do with it. Yes, she'd be real happy to see you in here, wouldn't she? She'd give that ugly sergeant a piece of her mind. Shh, he's coming. Get about your business, gal. Yes, Father. And if you've finished stuffing your face, I got a job for you. [door creaks] You would have to pick on Lindy Gray. She owns the Wainwright Hotel, and she's a mean shot with a musket. Just my luck. You made your own luck, Tom. Finish up. I have work to do. Wait, Jassie, don't go. Stay awhile. I've-- I've got to get out of here and find my father. It's important. I don't think they'll keep you here long. I asked my father, but all he can think about was Sam Steele coming. Sam Steele! He's the toughest law man there is! He's-- I know who he is Tom. Sam Steele is coming here? Yes, with Chief Poundmaker. They caught Poundmaker? Her Don't you know anything? His trial's already over. Steele's taking him to Stony Mountain Prison and-- [footsteps approaching] Why did you put them there, boy? That's why you said, sir. Do I? My mistake. I meant over there. [door shuts and locks] [dog barking] [music playing] [gunshot] MAN: And take that, you ugly hound! Jassie, what were those shots last night? It was Jake, wasn't it? Your pa shot him! So what? That was my sister's dog. [clang] I'm going to get him for that. Stray dogs run wild, Tom. They're dangerous. Jake is not a stray! He's abandoned, isn't he? Don't worry, somebody got there first. Jake's fine. Jake's all right? But who? Who do you think Tom? Jassie! Thanks. [music playing] [door shuts] [non-english speech] My goodness, what a handsome man. Jassie, there's the man for you. Rebellion could be done. [horse neighs] Whoa. Long live Louis Riel. Long live Poundmaker! Long live Louis Riel! We'll bring him in the back. Sir. [music playing] [gravel crunches] Prisoner escaping! Stop that boy! Argh! Do you know who I am, boy? No, sir. You're hurting me, sir. Sam Steele, sir. Sam? You little worm. Sam, it calls me. Stay here. Take care of it. [keys jingling] [cell door squeaks] Haha, desperado. [footsteps away] [door shuts] They're going to hang Louis Riel. It's the law. He's a rebel. Against your queen a million miles away? She's your queen, too, right? I've seen Riel. I've seen Crowfoot. Now, I've seen Poundmaker. I never saw this queen. She hasn't done a thing for me. Rebellion, it's wrong. All I know is your railroad drives the buffalo away. We're starving. Babies dying. We have to eat gophers, frogs, our own dogs and horses. How's you get in here? I came to Chief Poundmaker, before they locked him up. It was just kind of an accident. I didn't mean to hurt her. You hurt Lindy Gray? As far as I'm concerned, you can spend the rest of your worthless life in jail, boy. Sit down. You're looking for your father, name of Davis, right? [clears throat] Would that be William Davis? Yes, sir. You know where he is? Well, choke it out. There's a William Davis in hospital, sir, shot, sir, in pursuance of armed robbery with an accomplice. Is he-- badly hurt? Pretty bad, sir. Very bad. What about the other, the accomplice? Also shot. How bad? As bad as it gets, sir. Dead as mutton. He's dead? No, the other man is dead. Your father's in the hospital. If it is your father, Tom. Davis is a common enough name. Better take the boy over there. He's over there. Can I talk to him alone? Sorry, I got to stick with you. Of course you can. You can ask Sam Steele. Never stops reading the Bible. Tommy, Tommy Bradshaw. Fix-- fixing on heaven now. Hmm. Well, what are you a Bible man now, Willie Davis? A bit late for that. Sister Julie thinks it'll help. Help the-- Well, you need to pray after what you've done to my father. Voice of conscious, voice of conscious speaks. Tell me what happened. [panting] Tell me what happened. Tommy, it is you, Tommy, in the flesh. Tommy. You got my pa killed. What? How? Oh, not Gord. Gordy, he wouldn't-- he wouldn't go along with it. He had too much sense. I talked some other poor fool into it. You mean Pa's alive? Yeah. Yeah. His br-- his brother Boyd went on to Victoria. Gordy went after him. Come away now. [gasp] Tom, You listen to me. I killed-- I killed Sam Mordell, Tommy. I killed him. What? I didn't mean to. Knife was in my hand, was-- You've got to tell them. It was in my hand. You've got to tell them, Willie Davis. He can't talk anymore. Come back tomorrow. [footsteps] I've got to see Steele. [church bells ringing] I, Will Davis, confess to the-- Is he coming? Jass, I told you. It's important. I have to speak to him. Tom, I'm sorry. Your father-- No! Just after we left. [YELLING OF MILITARY DRILLING OUTSIDE] Then it's hopeless. The sister thought you'd want this. I'm sorry, Tom. [cell door clangs shut] I'm very sorry, Tom. You wanted to talk to me. Don't matter now, sir. Don't-- don't you think Tom's paid for what he did? Isn't that for the law to decide, Jassie? Well, if Miss Gray dropped her complaint-- And why would she do that? Oh, Mr Steele, Lindy Gray would do anything for you. [music playing] If you have a witness at all, Sam, it's your sense of humor. I know it's unusual, Lindy. You want me to feed and house the brutal ruffian who attacked me? What's so unusual about that? The boy's father died this morning. He's alone in the world. Stupid idea now that I think about it. Jail for you, my lad. Don't fuss yourself, Inspector. Sit down and finish your port. What arrangement were you thinking of? His labor in exchange for room and board for a year. No wages. He'd not be expecting a four poster. I do not believe in pampering these rascals. They must be made to pay for their folly. But instead of idling their time away in prison, the lad can be of use. Now, don't be spoiling him, Lindy. A blanket in the stable, good plain food, that's more than he deserves. Thank you, sir. But-- Do you know the name of my sergeant, boy? Fury, sir. Sergeant Fury. [music playing] I am taking a very, very big chance with you. If you let me down, you will be hunted from coast to coast by Steele and Fury. Ma'am. I'll start you off easy, till you're settled in. [footsteps] [dog barking] Hiya, boy. Your dad's Bible, Tom? Morning, Jass. Not for sentimental, are you? It's all you've got to remember him by. How could you leave it behind? He wasn't my father. He wasn't my father. Are you ever going to tell me the truth, Tom Davis? Bradshaw. Tom Bradshaw. Oh, Bradshaw. Now it's Bradshaw. What next? Look, Jass, listen to me, please. I don't care who believes me, as long as you do. So why didn't you just tell Steele that Davis confessed? Because I've got no proof, now that he's dead. I mean, who'd believe-- who'd take my word? I'll speak up for you. You've done enough. But if you run off, Sam Steele's going to skin you alive. Yeah, I know, but all the police are looking all over for him. And I've-- I've gotta find him, warn him, before they can catch up to him. What then, are you just going to keep hiding your whole life? If I could just find him, I know even if I tell him that-- that Willie confessed, he'd just give himself up. I just want everything to be back the way it was. I want us to be together again. Ma's going to have a baby, and Pa doesn't even know it. She needs him. [train whistle] I just have to find him, Jassie. You're going now, aren't you? I think I have to. I must be crazy, but all right, I'll cover for you. Thanks, Jassie. You're a friend. Tell Lindy I'm sorry. You better take this, Tom. It may not be your father's, but I guess you'll need all the help you can get. Thanks. You'll find him. I know it. Easy Jake, good boy. Told you I'd find you a good home. Here, Jass. Goodbye! [dog barking] Oh no, you don't, I'm not that silly. [music playing] [bird calls] [train puffing] [train squeaks to a halt] Here it is. I found it. OK. [mallet clanks] [inaudible] the other side. [rain trickling] Come on, let's go. [forest noises] Quiet, Jake. I swore I heard something over here. Ain't nothing here. [train horn toots] Jake. Jake! Jake? Jake? [frogs and crickets] [twig snaps] [owl hoots] Ah! [dog barks and whines] [hawk screeches] [music playing] [non-english speech] It's medicine. Jake? Jai? Ah, Jai! What'd you call him? Jake. [non-english speech] Drink. Wise man in China, he teach English doctor at mission. So I guess it's a long way to China, huh. Very long. Many months sailing across sea. I saved money, go home mother, sister. Have sisters? Yeah. Her name is Sarah. What are you doing here? Where'd he come from? Sick. Well, I don't want none of your wicky-wacky [dish clatters] Gumbo. Now you buzz off! [dog growls] Lookee busy. How long you been here, boy? About three days. You eating their food, railrat? They gave me some food, yeah. Well, that's not theirs to give. That food is supplied by the railway. You better earn your keep. Now you work alongside these coolies, you understand? It's fine by me. [dog barking] MAN: Hyah! Get lost, mutt! [music playing] Railrat, now put these in there. [non-english speech] That place, Boss, too low. Don't you tell me my business! Too low, Boss, too low. [non-english speech] Too low, Boss. Boss, too low. Chinamen trying to tell me my business. Just do it, all right! Wait, they ain't clear! Didn't I tell you once, boy? Now stay out of my way. There are-- Hey-- People in there! [non-english speech] No, wait! You watch out! [explosion] Everybody get back to work. You killed them. What are you saying? Murderer! You did that deliberate! Hey, you! What's the matter with you, huh? Huh? You killed them! So say you. They all say it. The coolies? Who are they going to tell? Eh? Come to that, who are you going to tell? I have friends in the mounties. Oh, I bet you do. I do. Sam Steele. I know Sam Steele. Look, don't you get it, boy? Eh? Nobody cares what happens out here. I'll bet you're on the run yourself. Hey! Don't go in there. The rock's not settled! [music playing] Chan Li? Chan Li? [pained groaning] Chan Li? Tom, Tom, you go. No fall of-- go out. No. I'm not leaving. You're the only one that speaks English. Ah! You got to tell them what you saw. Remember what he did. No listen to Chinaman. Ah! [non-english speech] It's gonna be all right now. [non-english speech] Ow! [non-english speech] [music playing] [chanting] Now they'll always be far from home. Bye, Chan Li. I'm going to help you, I promise. [train whistle in distance] [train steam hissing] [brakes squeak] [dog barks and whines] [music playing] I'll be back, Jake. I promise. Just gotta find someplace dry. Holy moly. [strings plunk] LILY MANSE: Oh, you're teasing me. CORNELIUS VAN HORNE: Nonsense! Oh, Cornelius. Well, I'd like to make a toast. To the health of the architect, the engineer, the genius of the great Canadian railway. It doesn't take much to draw a line across the map. Others did the work. Oh, Cornelius. You did build this railway, and it's an amazing achievement. Why won't you take the credit due? I meant what I said. The credit goes to a lot of other people-- thousands. But enough talk of business, Miss Manse. You did agree to honor this great occasion with a dramatic recitation that you yourself have composed. Ha, I said nothing of the sort. Well, a little song perhaps? Little song? Stephen Foster at least? If you insist. [clears throat] (SINGING) Beautiful dreamer, wake unto me. Starlight and dewdrops waiting for thee. Sounds of the rude world heard in the day, lulled by the moonlight have all passed away. Beautiful dreamer, prince of my song. Oh, list while I woo thee with soft melody. Gone are the cares of life's busy throng. Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me. Beautiful dreamer, awake unto me. [giggles] [MUSIC PLAYING - STEPHEN FOSTER, "BEAUTIFUL DREAMER SERENADE"] Now, you're a very strange man, Cornelius. It's nice of you to notice. If you'll excuse me, I think it's-- [snoring] Who the Dickens are you? Nobody, sir, just getting try, sir. Did you touch that humidor? Didn't hurt it, sir. How did you get in here? The door. Well, that's just the way you are going to leave. Cornelius, don't. You'll kill him. So what? You built your railway for the people, didn't you? Yeah, people who buy tickets. What's your name? Tom, ma'am. You sing beautiful. Balderdash. Do you, um, have a ticket, Tom? I don't have any money, ma'am. Oh, I see. No ticket, no money. You're right. Kick him out. And me. I don't have a ticket either. And what do you suggest? [scoffs] The child's starving. I suggest you feed him. Good night. [music playing] Are you hungry? [silverware clatters on plate] You're looking for your father, huh? It's quite a job. It's a big country. I know it now, sir. And that's your excuse for riding my railway across the country without a ticket? No, sir. I'm sorry, sir. But I have to find him. It's real important. Yes, yes, and you can't tell me why. So what do you think of it? Oh! It's fine. Real tasty. Not your dinner. The railway! Ha. The mountains, so vast, they make you feel tiny, like an insect. But if you can push two rods-- two little rods-- from one side to the other, you have done something, made a mark. [train whistle outside] It's fine, sir. It is, but-- But-- do you have a complaint? Sir, I was at a Chinese work camp, and I was hurt. They helped me out. Could never have done it without those people. I've always said that. It right, the way they're treated. What are you trying to say? Some of them were killed, sir. For no reason, I saw it. And their boss, he talked like they weren't worth nothing. But they helped me out. Sir, now you can throw me out that door if you want to, but it still ain't right. [music playing] Not yet! You'll break your stupid neck. LILY MANSE: Good morning! And how are you this morning? Well, go ahead. What are you waiting for? Cornelius! That little troublemaker, kicked him out. Oh? [giggles] [crowd exclaiming] [music playing] Nasty dog! Get away, get away! [dog whines] Here, boy. Here, boy. This is my dog. This dog yours? You sure? Yes, sir. [dog whines] Sam, come in. I'm sure we'll sleep safer, knowing that you are here. Only a fool would offer you any trouble, Cornelius. You must be the famous Sam Steele. This is Lily Manse. Darn rude woman, take no notice of her. Is it really true you disarmed 5,000 drunken rioters single-handedly, Mr Steele. Nonsense! Well, there weren't more than 1,000, and Sergeant Fury was with me. Sergeant Fury? Oh, you're teasing me. Sam, a story has come to my ears concerning the mistreatment-- perhaps murder-- of some Chinese workers. [music playing] Soon be through this job. What you going to do there, boy? Get word to my wife, somehow. Hey, stop! Jake! Hey you, stop! Stop! That's our dog. Yeah, who says? Come here, boy. Come on, Jake. Come on, boy. Come on. The dog says, OK? Hey, Rex? Come on, Rex. I saw you take him. Yeah, well, I found him, and I took him. And around here, that makes him mine. Listen to me. That's my sister's dog! Nobody-- nobody is going to steal my sister's dog! You want him? Take him. [grunting] I don't even want your sister's dog. Haha, I don't even know why I'm fighting for this stupid thing. Hey, punches. Hey, that's not a dog. It's a curse. Dog's been trouble the whole way. But he's our dog, and I'm keeping him. I think your a soft touch, pal. Eddie Mallandaine. Tom Bradshaw. So, uh, what's so special about Eagle Pass? It's where they're joining up the line. It'll be right across the country, coast to coast. I never want to see another train for the rest of my life. This'll be something to remember for the rest of your life, Tom. Yeah. You dropped your Bible. [train whistling] [dog barks and whines] This is nuts. Shut up, boy. [music playing] Right, this is nuts. (READING) I, Will Davis, confess to the killing of Sam Mordell. What is it, Tom? [clunking of hammers, shovels] Come on, come on, come on. Put your backs into it, men! I've got to get out of here. What? All right, men, take a rest. Take a rest. Hey, Mr van Horne. Congratulations, good job. Good job there. Should've worn my Sunday best. Oh! All right, we've got to just place it. Mr. van Horne, you men, if you gather yourselves around, that's good. Very good, thank you. Thank you. Oh, Jake. Hey, Tom, you're going to miss it. Be right back. OK, here we go. All right, is everyone ready? Now hold very still. [shutter flashes] [applause] All I can say is the work has been done well every way. CROWD: Hear, hear! [dog barks] Jake? Hey, what are you doing here? [music playing] Excuse me. I believe that we have met before. Sir, I can explain. This better be good, boy. What are you doing here? Boy? It's my father! It's my Pa! Pa! Pa! Pa! Tom, can it be you? I was looking for you. Looking, I don't understand. Where's your mother? She's all right. She back home with Grandpa. I wrote, but I couldn't send you an address. You came all this way, why? To find you and tell you. I don't recognize you. You're all grown up. You're different. Tell me. You don't have to run anymore, Pa. I've got-- Willie Davis. But I left Willie in Winnipeg. I-- It's a long story, Dad. But your mother's all right? Last I heard, she's going to have a baby. Sam Steele. I believe you're looking for me, sir. I know why. I think I can prove my innocence, if you care to look at this. I do not know who you are, sir. Or what on earth is going on here. It is this young ruffian that I want to hear from. I can explain everything. Start talking. [theme music]
