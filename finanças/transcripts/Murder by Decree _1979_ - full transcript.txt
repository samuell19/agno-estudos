[Hooves Clattering, People Chattering, Bell Ringing] [Bell Tolling] [Dog Barking] [Knocking On Door] [Dog Barking] [Dog Whimpering] [Orchestra Tuning Up] There seems to be an excessive delay, Watson. Waiting for the prince. They can't begin until he arrives. You know that. - "Punctuality," my dear fellow. Punctuality. "The politeness of kings." Yes, yes, yes, yes. He seems to take a delight in keeping his subjects waiting. [Chuckles] I suppose, since after all he's only the prince of wales, we should not expect the same degree of courtesy. And since you're only the prince of detectives, Holmes, I don't think you should presume to criticize a man... Who one day will be the king of England. Well done, Watson. You've cut me to the quick. [Laughs] Only the prince of detectives, you say? Pray tell me, who is the king? Lestrade, of course. [Both Laughing] [Applauding] [Audience Cheering] [Booing, Whistling] [Booing Continues] Good god. Insulting the prince. More respect is wanted. - If the prince wants more respect, he should conduct his affairs with more discretion. [Boos, Catcalls Continue] It's a damned disgrace. On the contrary. I prefer bad manners in the theater... To acts of violence in the streets. Hmph. God save his royal highness! - God save his royal highness! -[Man Cursing, Indistinct] [Several Men] Save his royal highness! [Pro-Royal Shouting Increases] [♪ "God Save The King" ♪] [Booing, Cheering Fade] Well done, old fella. You saved the day. [Man Breathing Heavily] [Dog Barks] [Footsteps] [Heavy Breathing Continues] [Growls] Oh. Flower. [Screaming] [Choking] [Groaning, Gasping] Murder in Whitechapel! Murder in Whitechapel! Whitechapel butcher strikes again! Read all about it! Read all about it! There you are, sir. [Chattering] [Woman] What are the police doing about it? Cabby! I say, cabby! Whitechapel butcher strikes again! Brutal murder investigated! Baker Street. 221B. Don't you think we should hire a closed carriage from now on, Holmes? Oh, I don't know. It's quite invigorating. Stirs the blood. [Sniffs Deeply] Nobody uses an open carriage in October, at night. I do. - Spoken with the utmost humility, my dear Holmes. This makes three. - Three? These women murdered in Whitechapel. There was that Annie Chapman, you remember? And then there was Polly... - Nichols. Polly Nichols, that's right, and now here's a third, as yet unidentified. Well, there's not much chance to study the evidence, old man. Nobody's asked me. [Chuckles] Police don't know which way to turn. Normally, they come to you when they're in difficulties. Why haven't they done so in this case, yeah? Answer that and you'll resolve the question which I must confess... Does cause me some concern. Yes, I'm sure it does. [Neighing] Yes, I see them, Watson. - What the devil? Whoever they may be, they have us at a grave disadvantage here in the Street. Mm. [Door Closes] Not yet, Watson! Hmm? Let's just see what we can before we advertise our arrival. Who are they? What are they doing out there? Is this some new case of yours you haven't told me about? Regrettably, no. I'm singularly unemployed, as you can hardly fail to have noticed. [Watson] How many of them? Can you see? Five at least. More perhaps. [Doorbell Ringing] Well, well. We shall know soon enough. Shall I go, or will you? - No, no, you stay here. They can't possibly have any business with me. Not old friends of yours, Watson? - What? No outraged husbands, I hope? [Ringing Continues] Very funny. Well, hurry up old fellow, before they wake the house! Yes? - Beggin' your pardon, sir. Is it Mr. Holmes? No, it is not. - Oh. Might I have a word with Mr. Holmes? At this hour of the night? Ridiculous. - Show them up, old fellow. We can make an exception in an emergency. All right, come in. Come in. [Clock Chiming] [Church Bell Tolling] Ah. Well, how may I help you? We're all members of the citizen's committee, sir. The three of us. I'm Mr. Makins, this is Mr. Lanier, and Mr. Cowe. Oh. Shall the other gentlemen join us, or will they wait outside? [Laughs] Yeah. You're right, sir. There are others. Yes, I could hardly fail to notice. Oh, sorry, sir, if we give you a bit of a fright. Trouble is, we didn't know how to approach you, sir. You know, I mean, with you bein' a famous gentleman and suchlike. I see. I see. What is the purpose of your citizen's committee? Well, we want this bloke stopped with his killing. We want him stopped and brought to justice. If it was the West End, the police would have him shut away by now. If it was rich women took his fancy in their palaces, and not poor women forced on the streets... [Chuckles] Look. I'll be straight with you, Mr. Holmes. We've all got shops down in Whitechapel. It's all right if you're on the main road. But if you ain't, well, no one goes off the main road. Not day nor night, they don't. Well, to be honest with you, trade's fallin' off something terrible. Yes. I can well imagine that people may be a trifle discouraged. It's bloody awful, sir. We might as well shut up shop until this bloke's... caught and put away. - Which is never, if we wait for the police. It strikes me, sir, they'd be glad of all the help you could give 'em. - I'd have to agree with you, Mr. Makins. - Yes, well... um, I shall think it over. It's like you said yourself, sir. It is an emergency. Watson, umm... would you see the gentlemen out, please? [Sighs] Sir, when can we expect to hear? U-Uh, soon. Soon. Oh, i-in the meantime, would you leave an address where you can be reached with the good doctor? You will try to persuade him, won't you, sir? - I'll do my best. If anyone can put a stop to these atrocious crimes... [Mumbling] That man is Sherlock Holmes. [Sighs] It strikes me as rather odd that these merchant chaps... Seemed so reluctant to advertise themselves. You seem strangely disinterested, Holmes. Almost rude, if I may say so. - Oh, not rude, surely. Well, old chap... what shall we do? Shall we take up the chase? I don't see that we have any choice. They've put their trust in you. Good, honest fellows. Good, honest fellows? Hmm. That may be. The ground will yield little tonight. We'll make a start in the morning. [Sighs] Holmes. I wish you'd refrain from cleaning your pipe out with my hypodermic needles. Yes, thank you, Watson. [Cat Yowling] [Footsteps] 'Ello, dearie! - Hands off. What'd you do that for? - Whore. Girl's got to earn a living, ain't she? What'd you do that for, then? You rotten bleeder! I didn't do you no 'arm, did I? [Horse Whinnies] Whoa, there. Whoa. [Man] Are you alone? - Yes! Yes! Come. It's not safe on the streets. [Streetwalker] Oh, God bless ya! Giddap! [♪ Violin, Classical] [♪ Violin Continues] [Sighs] Wake up, old fellow. [Groans] There's a cab waiting. The game's afoot. No time to lose! [Yawning] What is it, Holmes? An anonymous message advising us of another murder. [Groans, Yawns] Watson. Stir yourself. There is indeed some urgency. [Groans, Sighs] Watson? [Grunting] What? Okay. Oh. Two in one night. This is getting ridiculous. [Softly] Sherlock Holmes is here. Sherlock Holmes. What, here? I was wondering when we'd see you on the case. - Full time. Oh, Mr. Holmes. Inspector Foxborough. Inspector. My associate, Dr. Watson. How do you do, sir. Well, Lestrade. It appears you are having some difficulty with this fellow? I might be inclined to believe some of the stories they're tellin' about this bloke. What stories? - People says he's in league with the devil. Appears, disappears at will. - Ah, when people are frightened, they turn to god. When they have no help from him, they look to the devil. - Oh, nothing I believe. You're a medical man, Dr. Watson, so I don't have to warn you. Just the same, perhaps you should prepare yourself... For something that you may not have seen before. When you found the body, it was in this posture, just as it is now? Yes, sir. And the internal organs? For god's sake, Holmes. In just this fashion? - Yes. - Must you dwell on the beastly matter? Lestrade, you saw the other body? - Yes, Mr. Holmes. Was she mutilated in the same way? Her throat was cut. - Is that all? - [Watson] Ugh, surely... It seems like he was disturbed, almost caught him at it. [Policeman] Stand by, men. Come on, now. Move along. [Policeman Continues] What the devil are you doing here, Holmes? Who asked you to come meddling in police matters? Who's responsible? Foxborough, did you ask this man? Lestrade? - No, sir. No, sir. I assumed Mr. Holmes was here at your invitation. He's not. I've no use for his sort of bloody amateur. "Consulting detective." Get him out of here! No need to disturb yourself further, sir Charles. I don't wish to cause dissension. Come along, Watson. Who is that fellow, Holmes? Sir Charles Warren. New head boy, Scotland yard. - Oh, yes, I remember. Damn fool. Last year, those riots in Trafalgar Square. Exactly. "Bloody sunday," the papers called it. He was every bit as responsible as the radicals, in my opinion. Why does he have to be so deliberately abusive? - At the moment, my dear fellow, there is something more important which concerns us, if you can restrain your indignation. Shan't say another word. [Cat Yowling] [Dog Barking] "The Juwes are not... The men that will be... blamed for nothing." [Dog Barking] "The Juwes"... bloody hell. [Warren] Very well then. Get a report out and see me back at the yard. [Foxborough] This is important evidence! - I'm telling you, no! In an hour from now, there'll be a hundred people passing through here. More! If those words are seen, I have a riot! [Objecting Simultaneously] Any Jew that the mob can get their hands on will be slaughtered in the streets. With respect, sir Charles. Why don't we cover up the words? - No. Just the first line... the one word "Juwes." Isn't that enough? I'm not standing here and arguing with you. I'll just rub this writing off! There! Right here! Now maybe I'm damned. - You've not left a word. The commissioner of police rubbing out bloody words in London! These damned newspapers. They have the whole city in a blind state of panic. Last night, when we were examining the body of the unfortunate Catherine Eddowes... Mm. Don't remind me of that, old chap. Did you notice a woman in the crowd? - I noticed dozens of women. Well, yes, I would expect that of you, Watson. But one particular woman. [Fork Hits Plate] - Watson? - [Sighs] Yes. Listen, Watson, - [Sighs] What are you doing? [Inhales Deeply] I'm trying to corner the last pea on my plate. - What's that object you're fooling around with? - Oh, nothing. Yet. - Oh. - [Clears Throat] But, uh, as I was saying... About the woman... - I don't know how you can worry about some woman in a crowd, when you're supposed to be conducting an investigation. [Fork Hitting Plate] Ye... but there was a singularly haunting quality about her. Like some wild creature, cornered. You squashed my pea. Now you've got it cornered. Yeah, but squashing your fellow's pea... well, just trying to help. I didn't want it squashed. I don't like it that way, squashed. I like it whole. So that you can feel it pop when you bite down on it. Well, I'm sorry. I wasn't thinking. [Knocking] I'll get the door, old fellow. A telegram for you, Mr. Holmes. The boy didn't wait for an answer. Ah, well, thank you, Mrs. Hudson. And good night. - Good night, sir. [Door Closes] Ah, more from our anonymous adviser. [Sighs] He invites us to meet him... - At the Elizabeth Wharf. - Oh, really? No good. No one here. Hmm. You see? Just some damn sort of hoax. [Holmes] Our informant seems strangely reluctant to reveal himself. [Man] I couldn't commit this to a telegraph, Mr. Holmes. [Watson] Where are you? [Man] It's too dangerous for the man involved. Ah, there. In the boat, underneath us. [Holmes] Dangerous for you, too, I surmise. If you want to know more about the Ripper murders, I refer you... To Robert James Lees. - Where can I find this Lees? He's pulling your leg, Holmes. Robert James Lees, the elms, riverside way. [Clattering] There's more, Mr. Holmes. Anyone there? Anybody there? [Holmes] Watson? Watson! Saw him, eh? Recognize the fellow? - No, but the voice was familiar. - Uh? There's a quality in it I seem to know. What about this fellow he mentioned, Lees? Know him? Yes, I believe I do. He has some reputation as a medium. Good god! - Difficult to see how he might be involved. And that's all he had to say. - No. - He said something extraordinary. -Oh? A fascinating piece of evidence has been discovered. We must not lose a moment, if we could take advantage of it. 'Ere, what are you doing? Who are you? I mean, you have no business bein' here. Sherlock Holmes, my good man. Oh, yeah? - And my associate, Dr. Watson. I don't give a custard. You may be on him and off him. Is this Sherlock Holmes? Just you get yourself off and out of here, Mr. Sherlock Holmes. This is private property. And you along with him, Dr. Bleedin' Watson! I see you two sulkin' about! [Watson, Indistinct] - I think I should call the police, you know? - Don't do that, old man. Well, get goin' then. Get off. [Continues, Indistinct] [Clattering] Why'd the fellow have to hide himself like that? And why pass a message in such a ridiculous manner? It would suggest he didn't wish to be seen talking to us. Nobody there to see him. Ah, but there was. Well, it's news to me. As a matter of fact, they've been watching us... ever since we took up the case. They're watching us at this very moment. - Really? [Fizzing] There's nobody out there. Oh, naturally, old man, he's not going to show himself. But, as a precaution, we will leave through the garden. If things are getting dangerous, I don't like you to go unarmed, Holmes. I know you don't like carrying pistols, but just for safety... well, I'm not entirely unarmed, old chap. It's, um, very effective. Ancient Indian device. Used by a cult of ferocious assassins. Oh, the thuggee. Yes, that is one of their tricks. I did serve in India, you know. Of course you did, old chum. [Clears Throat] [Glass Smashing] [Dog Barking] What is it you hope to find? Or shouldn't I ask? - Give me a moment, dear fellow. Someone has been here before us. Someone who doesn't want anyone to see the message. Ah yes, here, I think. - I don't see anything. Give me... give me the bottle, Watson. And the brush. Mm-hmm. And, uh, hold the lantern steady. What is it that we're supposed to... oh! Now, quickly, Watson. Take this down. Before the plaster absorbs the liquid. Uh-huh. "Blame for nothing." Uh-huh. Uh-huh. There. - "The... Juwes?" "Are not the men that will be blamed for nothing." - Very well. [Watson] Well, there's the words, exactly as written. And the spelling? - Yes, it's very odd, isn't it? What do you think it is? Hebrew, you think? - Oh, I think not. It means Jews. How are we to understand it, then? [Mumbling] "Jews are responsible for the crimes." And? - [Chuckling] And they're not gonna get caught. Written by whom? Not the murderer, surely. - Whoever wrote this message... may have seen the murderer. [Scoffs] You're invaluable to me, Watson, with your instinctive grasp for the obvious. - [Chuckles] But why didn't he go to the police? Why did he write this ridiculous message? Ah, because a man might use these crimes for his own purposes. Imagine a more malign influence at work. "For his own purposes?" I'm not with you. I shall smoke a pipe or two before I retire. [Bell Ringing] Very well. I'll keep you company. No, no. No, old chap. We are grappling with a dark intention, and I have a sense of some vague outline. No, thank you. I would prefer my own company tonight. Well, of course. If you feel it's not wanted. [Clock Chiming] E-Early in the morning, old fellow, we have a pressing need to meet with Robert Lees. I understand you know something of the Whitechapel murders. I have seen the man known as Jack the Ripper. Good god! [Scoffs] [Train Whistle Blowing] I was sitting here, reading, when I was overwhelmed with an intuition of a man... And a young woman. But did you not go to the police? - Yes. And they treated him as a raving lunatic. It is an experience outside their own, something they cannot allow themselves to accept. Do you accept it? I have been witness to much stranger events. Well, the following evening, just such a murder took place. - The woman's name was Annie Chapman. - [Sniffs] Stuff! I have seen him again, Mr. Holmes. Another vision? No. No, this time in person. [Chattering] [Street Vendor Hawking, Indistinct] [No Audible Dialogue] Strange story indeed. But you've seen more of this man, have you not? - Madam, I'm sorry. -[Footsteps] Excuse me, ma'am. Mr. Holmes, sir Charles would like to see you. He was most insistent. I apologize for the interruption, ma'am. I had no choice. Well, thank you both for your hospitality. I know we shall meet again. [Door Closes] Good lord. It's Makins! You recognize this man, Holmes? - Yes, I do. You won't deny you were in his employ. I'm in my own employ, sir. This man, and others, inquired after my services. I have given them no reply as yet. - Don't play games with me! You're running with the foxes. And you know their colors full well. If I take correctly the meaning of your colorful metaphor, sir Charles, yes, I am aware that Makins was a radical, or revolutionary, to be exact. - I say, Holmes. - So! You admit your part in their conspiracy. Their treason! That's damn nonsense. What do you mean, sir? Steady, old fellow. I believe sir Charles means to arrest me. Arrest you? Sherlock Holmes, guilty of treason? That's absurd! - Not treason, Watson. Murder. - Precisely. I don't know what falling-out you had with your slimy friends, but I can place you at the scene of the murder. And don't be too certain I won't discover your treasonous plotting. Sir Charles? - I'll have plenty of time while you're sitting in Newgate Jail. There's that fellow from the docks. He must have seen everything that happened. Yes, I think rescue is at hand, and I don't believe the commissioner likes it. Quickly, Watson. I want to examine the wound. Holmes, why would radicals hire you to catch a madman? Yes, why indeed? Food for thought. Why feed us information in such a bizarre fashion? More important still, who killed Makins, and why? How did you know they were radicals? Mm, sword-stick. Oh, no magic, Watson. I simply made inquiries at Whitechapel. - That made you suspicious? No, it was Makins. A bad actor, with his excessive civility. And then Lanier's resentment of rich ladies and their palaces. It is fortunate for you, Mr. Holmes, that the dock guard was so diligent. Oh, I take it then, we're free. - For the moment, yes. Sir Charles would like to see you in his office immediately. Don't provoke him. He is determined to have you off this case. He's a dangerous man. He has many secret friends. So go carefully. "Secret friends." [Inhales] Curious expression. [Door Opens] I warn you, Holmes! If you pursue this mat... So... what the... forgive the sleight of hand, sir Charles. In the pursuit of criminals, one learns their devices. I say, Holmes, what is this mumbo jumbo? The handshake and the ring, Watson, are archaic rituals... preserved by the 33rd degree members of The Secret Order of Freemasons. We are not a secret order. Your existence is no secret. You rituals and membership are secrets you guard as closely as you may. Which is why you removed the writing from the wall. I am responsible for the safety of the people of this city. And their right to go safely about their business. - Does that include the right to murder and mutilate? - You fool! Jews would have been slaughtered in the streets if I had not had those words removed. Do you know the theory given greatest credence among the common people? That this is a blood ritual. Carried out by some Jew whose religious fervor... Sends him out in search of prostitutes... To offer as a sacrifice to his god. If those words had been seen, not a Jew would have been safe! Their houses and their shops would be destroyed. Nonsense, Warren. The writing had nothing to do with the Jews... you know that as well as I do. You did not remove that writing to protect Jews against anti-semitic rage. The Jews... or "Juwes"... referred to are from your own secret society... Of the loyal order of Freemasons. We... well, "benevolent society." [Bell Pealing] We are no danger... This is not the kind of paltry, sordid episode... You're accustomed to meddling in, Holmes. And you do so at great risk to yourself. Good day. You see. I can't imagine what that peculiar gesture of yours was all about. I couldn't make head nor tail over it. - It gave sir Charles pause. You shut him up! Quite a good thing, too. [Chuckling] I don't know which caused him the greater anxiety... The fact the I knew the secret signs, - or the possibility that I, too, might be a Mason. - Meaning what, exactly? These are the signs which are employed by Freemasons. in their ceremonies. To establish each other's rank. But how are the masons involved? Ah. Whoever wrote that message... Is a Mason... or a man like myself, who has made a study of their practices. You mean he accuses the masons? He wants us to believe that Jack the Ripper is a Mason? Oh, come on, Holmes. - I know. I've formed no opinion either way, Watson. But the Jews... or "Juwes"... against whom the accusations are being made, were three men who murdered the grand master, builder of Solomon's temple. Oh, really? According to masonic ritual. "And their names were Jubela, Jubelo... And Jubelum." Hence, Jews or Juwes. The things you know, Holmes. [Chuckles] Oh, when they were brought before Solomon, They confessed to their guilt. And Jubela said, "O that my throat had been cut across." And, uh, Jubelo said, "O that my left breast had been torn open, "my heart and vitals taken, thrown over my left shoulder." And Jubelum said, "my body severed in the midst." Good god. That poor woman's body was mutilated in just that savage way. Now, assuming that there is, as you say, some connection between those... Ghastly murders and the masonic ritual, in what way were these wretched women involved? Well, ask them. Hmm? What? Well, their friends. We have to ask the living, of course. We could hardly ask the dead. That's a relief. I thought for a moment you were going the same way as Robert Lees. Talking to the dead. [Clears Throat] Well... while you're making yourself familiar with the dead woman's friends, I shall endeavor to... [Liquid Pouring] [Glass Clinks] ingratiate myself with said Robert Lees. Hmm, good luck, Holmes. [Children Chattering] [Coughs] [Coughing] [Coughing Continues] Morning, guv. [Coughs] [Coughing] Hello, love. Oh. Madam didn't tell me to expect no chimney sweep. You... you fetch her down and she'll tell you. - I'll do no such thing. Here I am and here I stay. I've come to sweep the chimney... - But we're not ready for you! You have to come back. - You fetch the missus. [Coughing] What's going on down there? Mrs. Lees, I do apologize for troubling you in this manner. Who are you? I... I adopted this disguise... To spare your husband any further inconvenience. How dare you try and trick your way in to see my husband. Well, I really wanted to see you, Mrs. Lees, and, if you would allow me, to speak briefly with your husband. You see the danger you have put him in. And he has nothing to do with this. Yes. And I will abide by your decision. - But I say one thing... - I will not be swayed, Mr. Holmes. If your husband can help me find this man... And prevent any more of these atrocious crimes, do you have the right to deny me? Hmm, we were... Dining at home, And suddenly... [Train Whistle Blows In Distance] I knew that he had killed again. [Train Passing] [Holmes] And again, you went to the police. - Yes. They were more inclined to listen this time. - I was able to... Give them... Details that no one could have known. They asked me to track him... From the scene of the crime. [Lees] I could find no image of him there. There, where he had committed this brutal murder. They gave me um... a piece of the murdered girl's dress. And I- I could find no sense of him. And then the inspector gave me something quite trivial, unconnected perhaps. The stem from a bunch of grapes. How do you know that? But you were then able to sense the man. Yes. He... he was there. I mean, it was as if he was there. I had merely to follow him. There. Impossible. [Holmes] Now did you go into the house? [Lees] We did. You confronted the man. How did he receive you? The inspector spoke with him. [Train Whistle Blows In Distance] He was not impressed by my intuition. He heard us out politely, Reminded us how late it was, [Train Passing] and then he suggested that it would be better if we left. You've been most careful not to mention the man's name, haven't you? I realize how persuasive sir Charles can be. He came here. He threatened my husband in his own home. No. I can't expect you to break your word. Mr. Holmes, I have the strongest intuition concerning you. I sense some danger, [Train Passing] close and threatening. [Train Whistle Blows In Distance] I have a sense of it myself. [Chattering] It ain't fair. Everybody's going on like it's our fault... like we're to blame. Like as if we'd go out and look for him, egg the bleeder on to cut her bloody throat. What do you want to go asking about Polly for? What's she got to do with you? Writing about her, don't you know? Writing for the newspapers. You don't want to write nothing bad about Polly. Don't intend to, no, but it seems to me that a deal more... Is written about the murderer than about his victims. That's true. It's true, isn't it? Like he's important and they ain't. - Precisely. If anybody thought about the likes of us, we wouldn't have come to this. Uh, one thing, uh, Polly Nichols, was she friends with any of the other women? [Watson] Hmm? Hmm? [Whistle Blows] Talk to Mary if you want to know anything about old Polly. Mary. Uh, what's her other name? Mary Kelly. Mary Kelly. Where could I find her? You won't find her round here no more. She thinks herself a cut above us. Toffee-nosed slut. Uh, you know where I could find Mary Kelly? Come over 'ere. I'll tell you all about her. Excuse me, ladies. Better keep your mouth closed, you little slut. Don't bother with her. She doesn't know Mary. Come on. Sit down. Cheap tarts. They're jealous 'cause I'm young, and I get all the blokes. Got all me own teeth. That's why. What do you want with Mary Kelly anyway? Her teeth's fallen out too. Not like mine. Have a feel. - Oh, no. Thank you very much, but... Oh, come on, love. I won't bite you. See? Firm as a rock. Yes, remarkable. Oh, god. Oh, bloody hell. Oh. Just one loose. Oh, bloody hell. - What are you staring at? - Oh, I... nothing. Are we gonna sit here all day? Well, there's no hurry actually. Not for me either. I just thought maybe, uh... yes, well, um... now, suppose I'm looking for this young woman, this particular young woman. There's plenty of others. Yes. And suppose I say... I'm looking for this particular young woman. Um, uh... come with me. We can't talk here, if you take my meaning. Oh, yes, yes. I see what you mean. [Clucking] Near here the Ripper committed his first murder. You've got him on the brain. Can't talk of nothing else. I'm bound to talk about him. In there? - Want Mary Kelly? I'm taking you to her. Yes, but, um... hmm. Come on. I reckon that's why you come down here, all you toffs. You want to talk about him... what he done. Get a lot of toffs coming down here, do you? - All kinds. Of course, talk's all them blokes is good for. Not like you. Come on. This way. Uh, she lives around here, does she, Mary Kelly? Look. I'll tell you straight. I don't know this Mary Kelly. You... but you promised. You said... [Whistles] What's that for? Aha. And what are you doing? That's my woman you got there. What are you doing with her? An old geezer like you, with a fine lady of your own at home... Waiting for ya, worrying about ya, and you down here, messing about with my woman. Now, you wouldn't like me to go and visit your wife, now, would you? I see. So it's that old game, is it? Well, you've chosen the wrong victim, my good man. We'll see what the police have to say about this. [Blows Whistle] [Grunts] Good old Danny. [Groaning] Stay there, you pimp. What's the trouble here? [Watson] Thank goodness. Just in time. He's Jack the Ripper. [Man Groaning] Who, him? Yes I tell you, he grabbed me, and he was gonna slit my bloody throat... When my mate pulled him off and then he attacked him. Just a minute. - That old fellow? He couldn't rip my grandmother. I resent that. He's the Ripper. You better arrest him, or I'll scream and bring our mob. - You'll do nothing of the sort. You trying to get him killed? Come along. We'll sort this out down the station. You're making a grave error. - Serves you right, you old fart. Thank you. - Hey. Get off! I haven't done anything! Leave me alone! [All Chattering] [Keys Jingling] [Key Clattering In Lock] Well, well. [Laughs] Here's a pretty mess you've gotten yourself into, old chap. For God's sake, Holmes. [Groans] What's taken you so long? - Well, I came with all speed as soon as I heard. Now, he'll be released into your custody, Mr. Holmes. You'll be responsible for his future good behavior. You understand now? "Good behavior." Thank you very much. - Yeah. Learned your lesson, doctor? - Don't play the silly with us, Lestrade. My blokes tell me you put up quite a struggle. - I gave a good account of myself. I'm certain he did. [Chuckles] Mr. Holmes, my advice to you is that you take him home... And you see that he's not let get into any more mischief. Eh? - Oh, come along, Watson. For god's sake. [Watson] Damn the fellow. Didn't it occur to you that something was amiss when I didn't come home last night? Calm yourself, old man. I wasn't home myself. I had some business to... they were ready to tear me to pieces. - Yes. All right. Come, Watson. All we need is to take you home and get you a good meal and rest. I'm perfectly fit. Ready for anything. [Laughs] [Laughing Continues] Now, I don't believe the woman who gave me all this trouble even knew Mary Kelly. Kelly. - Yes. Mary Kelly. Friend of Polly Nichols. The people who lived in the district didn't seem to want to talk about her. That's good, Watson. That's very good. Now, Polly Nichols. Victim number one. She was murdered here. Victim number two, Annie Chapman, was murdered here. A considerable distance apart. Those two and Mary Kelly... heaven knows where she lives... they knew each other. The three of them were very often seen in a tavern in Dorset Street. That's Annie Chapman, Mary Kelly and Polly Nichols. - That's right. Now we come to, uh, Elizabeth Stride. That's victim number three. Liz stride. Murdered there. She was, uh, called Liz, "Long Liz." A tall girl. Foreign. She was married to... or rather, she lived with a man... Whose name I don't know, but their address was Dorset Street. You surpassed yourself, Watson. Now, these few women, living within a few streets, all knowing each other, that's more than coincidence, surely. Excellent, Watson. You're an inspiration. But I have more work for you. Yeah? - I need your help to find the man Lees sought out. Didn't Lees tell you? - No. He wouldn't tell me his name. Sir Charles Warren has put him in fear for his life, but I have a notion of his address. Study the medical directory. We're looking for a doctor. More precisely, a physician. There's a list of streets which you must pay careful attention to on my table. - Don't dash off. Wait for me. - We're too conspicuous. We must take separate paths. At least tell me where you're going. I'm going to pay my last respects to Catherine Eddowes. I feel she will be more help to us now than when she was alive. All right. [Bell Tolling] [♪ Bagpipes] [Drums Beating] [Tolling Continues] [♪ Bagpipes Continue] [Drumbeats Continue] [Horse Whinnies] [Metal Clattering] [Metal Scraping] [Scraping Continues] Mary Kelly? Stay away. I got a knife. I'll stick ya. I want to help you. My name is Sherlock Holmes. Why, what do you want with me? I must talk to you. Where can we go? [Sobbing] The streets are safe as anywhere else. Other people come looking for me. Yesterday there was this old bloke askin' after me. You can trust me. I can't trust no one! [Gasps] Oh. Ow. [Gibbering] What have I done for this? [Sobbing] I know that something's frightening you. What is it? Tell me. I want to tell someone. [Panting] As long... as long as someone knows... someone else. Tellme. No. I told... I told Annie Chapman and they done for her. [Hoofbeats Approaching] [Whinnies] Did you tell Polly Nichols? Did you know poll? You told her, didn't you? No. [Sobs] Jesus. I... [Breathing Erratically] Yes. [Sobs] [Hoofbeats Approaching] She... she was with me often. [Horse Whinnies] They must have seen us. They? Who are they? Why are they looking for you? Whatever you've done, whatever you know, there's no reason to fear me. Aye, no. The baby. - Baby? She gave her to me. She said, "look after her." She? Who? Annie. Annie Chapman. Annie Crook. Well, they took her... [Cat Meowing] And shut her away. Uh... but they don't dare to kill her. They have to keep her shut away. Where have they taken her? - For all that, Eddy still loves her. Eddy? - He wouldn't let them kill her. Oh, sweet Jesus. I'm so frightened. [Hoofbeats Approaching] Where can I find this Annie Crook? I don't know. She was at St. Christopher's, but she's out of there now. They took her. [Horse Whinnies] [Whimpers] Help me. Won't you please help me? Come, Mary. I'll take you somewhere where it's safe. - I can't sleep no more, for fear they'll find me when I'm not watching. [Hoofbeats Approaching] [Gasps] [Bell Tolling In Distance] [Groans] Well, well. Thank God you're all right. I don't seem to be able to recall anything. I'm not surprised. You may have sustained a slight concussion. What the devil were you up to? [Chuckles] Well, There was a woman. [Watson] Mm-hmm. What happened to her? Well, Lestrade told me to expect something dramatic, but he didn't prepare me for something quite so downright stupid. Foxborough. Whoever it was was trying to murder you. It was no accident. Yeah. But there was a young woman. I remember. I want you to rest for a while, Holmes. I saw the cab, and I saw you, but I... I didn't see any woman. I'm sure there w... Watson discovered something, remember, that you might find useful. It's good of you to say so, Holmes. It was that three of the murdered women... [Watson] Holmes, please. - Had, uh, a common link. They all frequented a tavern in Dorset Street. Dorset Street. - The Black Horse? Yes, that's the one. Should you require further information about Polly Nichols, I was told one should speak to a Mary Kelly. - And that was the woman. - Yes? I was talking to her when the hansom ran me down. Yes. I had an intuition that... She might be at the center of this pattern of events. I'll set my men to look for her at once. Mary Kelly, you say? Yes. Oh, Foxborough. Oh, I'm sorry. Would you care for me to wait? Uh, no. On the contrary. With the assistance of the good doctor, I shall pursue my own line of inquiry. [Sighs] Holmes! - Yes? You're always dashing off without telling me where you're going or what our objective is. St. Christopher's hospital, old fellow, looking for a woman named Annie Crook. Oh. Now we know. Did you have much luck with the medical directory? Oh, yes. Uh, too much, I'm afraid. I found the names of no less than a dozen physicians in the general area. A mere dozen? I thought there would have been at least a hundred. Holmes, to me, it's inconceivable that any physician could be remotely connected... With these atrocious crimes. You must not allow loyalty to your profession... To prevent you discovering the truth, my dear fellow, no matter how unpalatable. Well. Illustrious names indeed. Thank you. I'm only too sorry, Dr. Watson, that I haven't been able to give you any more positive information. On the contrary, you've been most cooperative. Thank you very much, doctor. Doctor, Mr. Gregory. Annie Crook isn't here. - Oh, come, come, Watson. I told you that. But where is she? It's no easy matter persuading these johnnies to talk about their patients. I'm sure you did an excellent job. Told them she was a servant of the family who'd come to London. Promised my mother I'd look her up. - Yes. Yes. Well, I trust you weren't too inventive in your mendacity. But, come, Watson, a simple story, please. I'm doing my best. Where is Annie Crook? A broken neck and scapula. Yes, yes, Watson. [Clears Throat] Oh, yes. Annie Crook. Uh, they took her to a hospital near reading. According to what the doctor says, it's more like an asylum. - She's still there? In her physician's opinion, she'll be there for the rest of her life. It seems that the poor woman is, um, insane. Her physician is, by the way... - Yes. Sir Thomas Spivey. Good God. One of the court physicians. You knew already. - Well, the name is on your list, Watson. And I have been compiling another list of my own. I can't keep pace. - Yes, there is a particular variety of grape, Watson. Grape. Specially imported for those with the most discriminating of tastes. And among the people who place an order for them... sir Thomas Spivey. - The only name we find on both our lists. Are you suggesting it's a court physician? To be sure, Watson. To be sure. I've been exploited, old fellow, by the very people for whom we are searching. It's time we turned the tables. [Whistle Blows] [Watson] This woman we're about to visit, this Annie Crook, She had a dreadful accident, not unlike yours. It seemed like superficial injuries at first, and then things took a turn for the worse, and sir Thomas decided to have her committed. [Holmes] Yes. Odd. Very odd. Why is this woman so damned important to you, Holmes? At the moment, I'm as much in the dark as you, but I draw your attention to the peculiar circumstances of the man who is following us. There's nobody following us. It is to that peculiar circumstance that I draw your attention. Oh. [Chuckles] You mean, why not? Exactly. Ah. Ah, yes. [Man] Whoa there. Whoa there. [Whinnies] Drive on. - [Man] Come on. Giddap. Giddap. Giddap. [Neighing] [Hinges Squeak] [Whispers] Leave me alone to talk with the girl as long as you can. Uh-huh. [Key Clattering] [Door Squeaks] Please try not to disturb the others. [Moaning] [Moaning Continues] She hardly seems to know that we're here. Well, I'm quite sure that she doesn't, Dr. Watson. It's a strange phenomenon. She hasn't spoken a word in six months. Has her condition deteriorated, would you say? Since she first came here? Oh, yes. Yes. Markedly. [Watson] I'd very much appreciate a glance at her records. -Is that possible? - Yes. You'll find them interesting, I think. Yes. I'm sure I would. You'll excuse us. [Woman Moaning] [Door Hinges Squeaking] [Muttering] [Key Clattering] [Muttering Continues] Annie. I'm a friend. Mary sent me. Mary Kelly. Do you remember her? Mary's frightened, Annie. She's frightened for her life. I'd like to help her, but I can't... Till I know why she's frightened. [Pencil Scratching] [Women Murmuring] [Murmuring Continues] Eddy. Where? [Laughs] He sent you? Eddy sent you. You. I knew. I knew... He would send... he would come for me. Hmm. [Chuckles] No. Mary sent me. Mary. Mary. Mary... Yes. Sent you? How? They won't let me see. They? Mary doesn't know. Well. Nobody knows. Why? Why won't they let you see Mary? My baby. Is my baby safe? Mary, keep my baby safe. Don't... don't... Let... them hurt... now, why would they want to hurt your baby? - Ah. Why do they keep you here? Danger. For them. Eddy said... hate me. Angry with him. And the baby... he said, "when they know... kill." - They? He... - Who are "they"? Brought me here. I don't belong here. You can see. [Woman Moaning] Can't you see? [Moaning Continues] I'm not crazy. They are all crazy here. I won't stay here. I won't let them keep me. I will fight them, and I'll make them... help me. Why do they keep you here? Why does Eddy let them keep you here, if he loves you? - He loves me! [Women Murmuring] [Woman Whining] [Whining Continues] He loves me. Didn't he marry me? Didn't we have a baby? - He loves me! - Why does he let them keep you here? [Screams] I don't know! [Women Yelling, Whining] [Annie] Oh! [Yelling, Whining Continue] But I haven't seen him. They won't let me see him. They... he doesn't know where I am. Uh, they tell him I ran off, I took the baby, I don't love him. I'm going to make trouble for him. I love him. Then he must be told where you are. Don't let them hurt me anymore. I won't tell, and they hurt me. Yeah. They hurt me. Why do they want to hurt you? What do they want to know? They want my baby. And I know they'll hurt my baby if I tell. - Oh, God in heaven. But I can't tell. I don't know. I say that, and they hurt me. Please, don't let them hurt me. Annie, "they"... who are "they"? Tell me, please. I ca... I told them. [Gasps] I told them. Mary. I... gave my baby... To Mary for safekeeping. I told Mary to keep my baby safe. [Key Clattering] [Door Opens] I told them. [Annie] Told them. What the devil are you doing? Told them. There... you have no business keeping this woman in restraint. Holmes. Who are you? She needs care... desperately needs care. [Chuckles] [Man] She has every care. Watson, we must take this woman from this hellish place. [Watson] Holmes, you can't do that. Sherlock Holmes. Th-this woman came here of her own free will. She has no family to claim her. It is the opinion of her physician... And the board that she should stay here until such time... [Yells] Holmes, for God's sake. [Screaming] [Screaming Continues] [Screaming Continues] [Women Screaming, Yelling] [Woman Cackling] [Screaming, Yelling Continue] [Train Whistle Blows] Holmes. Are you all right? I know you don't want to talk, but it does help sometimes, you know. I hate to see you upset like this. [Holmes] The heir presumptive. - I beg your pardon? The Duke of Clarence. "Eddy," she said. Oh, god. I can't believe it. I now know why we were not followed. They thought Annie Crook was hopelessly insane. They never counted on her courage... And her extraordinary will to protect her child. It's too late for Annie now. And I fear it will be too late for Mary Kelly... If we don't find her this very night. We must save her. [Train Whistle Blows] Forgive me, Watson. I can spare no thought for any other matter. [Foghorn Blows] [Hoofbeats Passing] [Man Yelling In Distance] [Foghorn Blows] [Whinnies] [Man Yelling In Distance] Any news of the Kelly woman? - Not a word, sir. We've got every man we can walking the streets. If another woman's murdered tonight, I swear... - Where's Foxborough? I don't know, sir. He's gone off on his own somewhere. He's a funny bloke. Can't get him to stay in one place. - Come along, Watson. Oh, sir. Did you hear about sir Charles? He chucked in the sponge. Given up. Gone home. Would you believe it? - Yes, I believe it. His failure reflects as much on you as on him. Warren would never have been able to pervert justice... Had any one of you stood up against him. Absolutely. Sir Charles resigns? I find that baffling. Now Mary Kelly. They should know something at the Black Horse Tavern. That's precisely where we're going, Watson. - Oh. [Whinnies] [Heavy Breathing] [Footsteps] [Man Laughing] [Men Singing] No! [Whimpering, Moaning] [Screaming] [Dog Barking] [Clattering] [Moans] No. [Sobbing] [Screams] No! [Dog Barking] You're aware that we're being followed. - Yes. For some time now, I think. [Foghorn Blows In Distance] Yes. Of course. I suppose it would be foolish to offer you... [Clears Throat] Come. Ah. [Footsteps] [Dog Barking In Distance] Walk ahead of me. [Barking Continues] [Footsteps Approaching] [Scoffs] Mr. Holmes. Good. Where is Mary Kelly? We're all searching for her. I've got men in every house. You had her, Foxborough, and you lost her intentionally. [Footsteps Approaching] What on earth are you talking about? Why has he been following us? - Huh? It may surprise you to learn, Watson, [Bell Tolling] That this is our mysterious informant. Uh-huh? Using his agents Makins and Lanier... To deliver messages to steer us into whichever direction he chose. - You're insane. - No, inspector. [Bell Tolling] You are the head of a radical movement. I have proof. Rest assured. Your career at Scotland yard is finished. Do you want him to get away with it? Do you want Mary Kelly butchered like all the others? You don't care a damn about what happens to Mary Kelly, or any of the other pathetic women. Well, perhaps that's true. Perhaps they're not important. Except insofar as they show... This government's aristocratic contempt for the people and how they suffer. If you, Sherlock Holmes, can't see the corruption around you, then perhaps some people do have to die in order to expose it. Oh, you'd let them all die. You'd let Mary Kelly die. Yes, by god, I'll let her die. But if you find the killers, and it can be shown... that my superiors in the government have concealed evidence, if you can expose their lies, their abuse of power, then perhaps we can... we can bring this decadent monarchy to its knees. He's out of his senses. He doesn't know what he's saying. Yes, he does, Watson. He knows full well. He knows exactly what he's doing. A man devoid of conscience, as guilty as the murderer himself. She trusted you, Mr. Holmes. She came out of hiding because she trusted you. So, if they got her, it's because she trusted god-almighty Sherlock Holmes. - Foxborough, stay away from me. -They used you. We used you. You did exactly what we wanted you to do. If she dies, and you come under my hand, expect no mercy. You have my word on it. A radical in Scotland yard? Terrifying. Holmes, what did you mean when you said... oh. Holmes, what he said about the government being involved, that can't be. I'm afraid it is. [Horse Whinnies] How high up? [Whinnying Continues] Perhaps to the throne. What? [Metal Clatters] [Fire Crackling] [Squeaks] - [Sizzles] - Aahh! I'm so sorry, old man. After them. Go on. I'm all right. [Panting] May I suggest you take this? [Chuckles] [Horse Whinnies] Aah! [Footsteps] [Groans] [Groaning] [Blows Whistle] [Police Whistle Blowing] [Police Whistle Blows In Distance] [Gagging] [Gagging Continues] Hey! Hey! [Groans] [Panting] Watson. [Holmes] Help Watson. [Door Opens] - Gentlemen. Mr. Holmes. - Prime Minister. I thought it would be better we should meet here. We can be sure of privacy. "Secrecy" would perhaps be the more appropriate word. Shall we agree upon "discretion"? You have already spoken to the home secretary. I have indicated something of the matter to him, yes. I have summoned you here because you have made statements... Which affect the very existence of the social order of this country. Let me make it plain. What is at stake will not permit unconsidered actions, nor injudicious statements. We shall take action if we must. And I can assure you that action will be effective. The sequence of events, Prime Minister, convince me of your ability to take effective action. You have me at a disadvantage, Mr. Holmes. I think it might be better if you tell us your story in your own way... And permit me to be the judge of whether it is true or not. You may take it to be true, sir. The first link in my chain of circumstances... Is a woman by the name of Annie Crook. I see you recognize that name, home secretary. In other circumstances that would surprise me, since she is a woman of the lower classes, hardly likely to affect the life of anyone so powerful. Your irony is out of place. You would be wise, Mr. Holmes, to resist the temptation to condescend. Prime Minister. How does Annie Crook concern anyone here? I found her. She told me some fragments of her pathetic story. She met her lover... First at the household where she was employed. She fell in love with him. He was infatuated briefly with her. With her gentleness, her beauty and her innocence. [Man] And in the face of this congregation... He went through a form of marriage, and soon after, tired of her, he left. She bore him a child. This much was done without attracting notice. And then, when the existence of the child was discovered, and its religion... catholic... the government suddenly became concerned. [Prime Minister] You must forgive me, Mr. Holmes. I had expected an account of more significance. How can all this affect the government of England? You exaggerate, surely. Her lover, her husband, however you may call him... her seducer... was his grace, the Duke of Clarence and Avondale, Albert Victor Christian Edward, Earl of Athlone, the heir presumptive to the throne of England. Known as Eddy to his more intimate acquaintances. An indiscretion, Mr. Holmes. Hardly a crime. [Prime Minister] Certainly nothing so serious... as to warrant all this passion. Well, not a crime. Not yet, Prime Minister. An inconvenience. Yet you yourself made it known it would be preferable if the woman... indeed, the problem itself... did not exist. [Holmes Narrating] And one man among the many... who was privy to the prince's indiscretion... took on the filthy work. And that same man drew another into his hideous conspiracy, by persuading him they had the official sanction of the highest in the land. They sought out Annie, and they deceived her... By promising to take her to her beloved Eddy. It was a simple matter to arrange. She was taken to hospital. From that hospital she was removed to another place, more distant, more secure. Alone. Abandoned by her lover. Tormented and confused, they forced her to tell them that she had given her child to a friend for safekeeping. And the search for Mary Kelly and the plot for her disposal had begun. Ohh. They searched. Nothing would stop them. They searched for Mary. They searched for the child. [Holmes Narrating] In terror for her own life, Mary shared the secret of the royal indiscretion. And, in doing so, sealed the fate of her friends. They murdered anyone who might have known of the child. Thus was born the myth of Jack the Ripper. Polly Nichols, Annie Chapman, Liz Stride... And Catherine Eddowes... Were slaughtered and their deaths disguised as the work of a madman. And to my everlasting regret, I led the murderers... Straight to Mary, the one woman they had searched for so long and in vain. First, she escaped. [Holmes Narrating] Then... [Screams] No! - She died. But she died without revealing... the very thing they needed to discover. [Screams] No! - Where to find the child. [Man Yells] And so the victims and the crimes. What of the criminals? It remains for you to prove these allegations, Mr. Holmes. [Prime Minister] And I'm curious to know how far you will press your accusations. I don't begin with you. I begin with a man who is already dead. [Holmes] William Slade, prime mover in these atrocious crimes, who set them on from some misguided loyalty to the royal family he served, or as a hidden agent in their cause. [Holmes] I accuse sir Thomas Spivey, the celebrated physician, Whose hospital took Annie Crook and drove her into madness. A man who prescribes eternal incarceration for a woman... Simply because she was seduced, made pregnant and delivered of a child; who, according to archaic ritual, butchered his victims. I accuse a man who has no place in this world or the next. You accuse, but it is proof we need, Mr. Holmes. We've heard this tragic story now, but what is your link with Annie Crook? Where is your proof? You have no proof. Only surmise and wild conjecture. I have proof. I have proof that a woman was cynically taken in marriage. I have proof of the husband's name; that a child was born. I have proof that the woman was committed to an asylum by order of Spivey. I have proof of evidence suppressed by you, sir Charles. Evidence which seemed to accuse... a member of the sacred order to which you all belong. You are all Freemasons. You, Prime Minister. Home secretary. Sir Charles, you. And Spivey... all Masons. And in discovering the involvement of a fellow Mason, you were sworn to protect him in his criminal intent. Then you accuse us! Of complicity in murder? No, Prime Minister. Your suggestion was enough to prompt these men to action. What was done was all done in your name. I shall not debate that with you. There are larger issues here than you can understand. Don't presume to judge us, Holmes. I know where my duty lies: In the protection of the monarchy. There is not now, nor has there ever been, a danger to the monarchy. That thought existed only in the minds of the three men in this room! Your intrigue simply served the disaffected radicals, whom you fear. Very well, Mr. Holmes. Slade's dead. Spivey is insane. Sir Charles... his career is ruined. What sort of ruin does he face? Will the Masons punish or reward him? He kept faith with you. Your oath of fellowship binds you to support him. What shall I tell the Queen? You surely don't suggest that her majesty is in any way involved? I cannot easily believe that. - You have my word! - I would prefer some more reliable authority. In the circumstances, I shall ignore your offensive attitude. If I seem to be offensive, Prime Minister, you may take it I am offended! You offend me. Shall I resign? Would that satisfy you? Yes, resign. And if I had the means, I would compel you. You know what you risk, Mr. Holmes. The ruin of your own society... And the substitution of a radical, anarchist ideology. I care nothing about that. You're all the same to me. You, Prime Minister, Foxborough and the radicals... all of you equally to blame. God knows, if I could prove your complicity, I would not hesitate, but I was not a party to your secret councils. Only you know to what extent you are responsible. For the moment, however, as long as the child is safe, you have my word I shall keep silent. But in the event she is harmed in any way, I will make public everything I know. The whereabouts of this child are unknown to us. We are satisfied they should remain so. And Annie Crook... must be set free. Unhappily, she is already free. The night after her meeting with you, Mr. Holmes, she died. How? Died? [Prime Minister] She took her own life. Free? I wish I had some reason to believe you. How may I convince you? Even if you could convince me, it's too late. It's too late for Annie Crook. Separated from her child, driven to despair... And death. You create allegiance... Above your sworn allegiance to humanity. You will not feel for them... Or acknowledge their pain. There lies the madness. Well. Well, Mr. Holmes. Remember you have promised to keep your silence. Our business is finished. Finished. Perhaps for you, but not for me. I will always have the death of Mary Kelly on my conscience. And you, Prime Minister, will have the deaths of Annie... And all those tragic women... And their agony... On yours. ♪♪ ♪♪ [Paper Rustling] Come away, Holmes. Come and sit down. We've unmasked... madmen, Watson. Wielding scepters. Reason run riot. Justice howling at the moon. But, Holmes, you did much more than any other man could have attempted. And there's... still decency. Annie Crook and Mary Kelly... Dying to protect a child. You're right. There is decency. And if nowhere else, in that battered breast of yours. Hmm. I think, if you will allow me, I will play now for a while. "If you will allow me." Thanks for that. Yes, Holmes, play. [♪ Violin] [Inhales Deeply] [Exhales] [♪ Violin Continues] [Dog Barking] [Barking] [♪ Violin Ends] [No Audible Dialogue]
