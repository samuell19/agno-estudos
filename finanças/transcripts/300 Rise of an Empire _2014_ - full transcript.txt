[HORSE SNORTS] VVOIVIAN: The Orac:|e's words stand as a warning A prophecy Sparta will fall All of Greece will fall [YE|_|_|NG] And Persian fire will reduce Athens to Cinder For Athens is a pile of stone and wood and cloth and dust hangs on their every syllable Only the Athenians exist And only stout wooden ships can save them. Wooden ships and a tidal wave of heroes' blood Leonidas, my husband Leonidas, your king Leonidas and the brave 300 are dead The free men and women of Greece ...are not bound by a beautiful Spartan death \/\/ar is not their love Yet he lay down his life for them For the promise Greece holds Tis our enemies who forged our freedom in the fires of war. lt was King Darius who came to take our land Ten years ago, when youth still burned in our eyes before this bitter war forced our children to become men. Ten years ago, this war began as all wars begin With a grievance lVlarathon The Persian king, Darius annoyed by the notion of Greek freedom has come to Greece to bring us to heel He makes landfall at the field of lVlarathon with an invading force which outnumbers... the Greek defenders three-to-one And so at dawn, the hopeless Athenians do the unthinkable. They attack They attack the weary Persians as they disembark... ...their ships on shaky legs after a month at sea They attack before they can establish their war camp... and supply their soldiers And Who is the architect of this mad strategy? A little-known Athenian soldier His men call him Themistokles He gives the Persians a taste of Athenian shock combat. [THEIVIISTCKLES YELLS] [ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING] [HoRsEs NE|oH|No] [HoRsE NEIGHING] [ALL SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY] [vE|_|_s] [vE|_|_s] GORGO: All thoughts of glory are gone Thousands dead Hundreds of them their own All for an idea: A free Greece an Athenian experiment called "democracy." Could this idea be worth it? \/\/orth all this sacrifice? Themistokles would let the good King Darius decide For through the chaos a moment appeared And Themistokles would seize it A moment that would ring across the centuries A moment that would raise him from simple soldier to the height of Athenian political power O A moment that would make Themistokles a legend. Yet even as the praise and glory were heaped upon him Themistokles knew in his heart he had made a mistake. lt was Darius' son, Xerxes whose eyes had the stink of destiny about them. Themistokles knew he should have killed that boy That glorious mistake would forever haunt him And so it was Themistokles himself ...who sent a ripple across the Persian empire and set into motion forces that would bring fire to the heart of Greece. For as the good king lay dying all his greatest generals ...and advisors were summoned to his bedside None greater ...than his finest naval commander, Artemisia Her ferocity bested only by her beauty Her beauty matched only by her devotion to her king Darius favored Artemisia among his generals... for she had brought him victory on the battlefield. ln her he had the perfect warrior protegee that his son, Xerxes, would never be DARIUS [IN STRAINED VOICE] So sweet, my child. l\/ly sweet child XERXES Father. Xerxes Do not repeat your father's mistake Leave the ignoble Greeks to their ways Only the gods can defeat them Only the gods GORGO: For seven days, Xerxes mourned paralyzed by grief On the eighth day, Artemisia whispered the seed of madness that would consume him [WHISPERING] Your father's words were not a warning but a challenge Only the gods can defeat the Greeks? You will be a god-king GORGO: Artemisia gathered the priests, wizards ...and mystics from every corner of the empire They wrapped the young king in Cimmerian gauze dipped in ancient potions... and set him to wander the desert till in a delirium of heat and thirst he stumbled upon... a hermit's cave Xerxes passed the vacant eyes and empty souls ...of the hollow creatures that dwell in the dark corners of all men's hearts And in that darkness he surrendered himself completely to power so evil and perverse that, as he emerged ...no part of a human man that was Xerxes survived. His eyes blazed like scarlet coals He was stripped, cleansed, glabrous and smooth Xerxes was reborn a god Artemisia trusted no one So in the cover of night the palace was cleansed of all Xerxes' allies. All those he trusted all those who had raised him ...all those he had once looked to for counsel were quickly introduced to her wrath [CROWD CHEERING] And as the god-king stood before his people Artemisia watched her flawless manipulation take shape. -For glory's sake... ARTEIVIISIA [VVHlSPERS]: For glory's sake for vengeance's sake for vengeance's sake Wai' war! [CROWD CHEERING] GORGO: \/\/ar is coming to Greece in the visage of a monster army over a million strong. lt should be little more than a formality for Themistokles... the hero of lVlarathon to finish what he began Please! We must appeal to Xerxes' reason! MAN 1 : Coward! Athens is a city of cowards! Shut your cock hole! Shut your own! l'll kill you! Fuck the Spartans! Fuck those muscle-bound boy-lovers! Silence! MAN 2: Silence for the hero of lVlarathon! THEIVIISTOKLES: This is a democracy, not a street fight IVIAN 3: Quiet! lt's Themistokles The Persian attack will come from both the north and the south The city-states should negotiate a truce Yes, yes, we must negotiate THEIVIISTOKLES: Negotiate with tyranny? Give me one example of when that has ever profited a nation. MAN 4: You're right. We must unite. THEMISTOKLES: My fellow countrymen we can only judge the future from what we have suffered in the past Now, many of you here stood with me at Marathon And for those of you who served ...and faced the cut and thrust of battle.. you know how true peace is forged Do not be deceived Xerxes, the son of Darius is a wolf at our door Right here, right now we must choose Do we stand and fight for Greece or not? Argos Corinth Megara Athens Not even Sparta can match the Persians alone We must persevere as one nation Or we will perish clinging onto our own self-interests Send us the ships that we need to defend Greece. Themistokles will need more than our cities' ships. He will need our children to join the fight. [CROWD M URM URS] And what of Sparta? You send every ship that we have to the northern coast of Euboea I will go and seek the help of the great Spartans. [CROWD MURMURING] ARTEMISIA Still no word. .from the messenger you sent to Sparta. King Leonidas may have been insulted by your generous offer. Perhaps I need to march into Sparta myself and burn it to the ground. Remember when a king is loved as I am much can be accomplished They would be fools to resist my divine power Athens is attempting to assemble a coalition lt'll be nothing more than a patchwork of ships Once these waters have been traversed I will lead my force across the land. I will remind the cowards of Greece that we have not forgotten their insolence Rest and water the horses lt's best I go alone Spartans don't get along well with others [GRUNTING] [MEN GRUNTING IN UNISON] [GROANS] -Spartans. DILIOS: Themistokles You old snake What brings you this far south? -l've come to see Leonidas. To warn him the Persians are on the march -You're too late. Persian messenger already presented his terms to Leonidas. Symbolic offering of earth and water Spartans! Know this and know it well [couoHs] That any Spartan's finest moment the greatest fulfillment of all he holds dear is that moment when he has fought his heart out for the preservation of Sparta and lies dead on the battlefield victorious Now who is willing to die at our king's side? MEN [IN UNISON] Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh! Ah-ooh! GORGO: Themistokles You've come a long way to stroke your cock whilst watching real men train. THEMISTOKLES Queen Gorgo. Shouldn't he be training them to live at their king's side? THEMISTOKLES: A new age is dawning, Gorgo Won't be long before men rise up and shed the yoke of mysticism and tyranny That sounds like a threat -No. An opportunity to join the rest of free Greece and stand against a true tyrant. Unless, of course, you and Leonidas have already made a deal with Xerxes No terms were reached Xerxes' messenger was Well, he was rude and he lacked respect He didn't understand the same threats made in Thebes and Athens would not work here. This is the birthplace of the world's greatest warriors Men whose king would stand and fight and die for any one of them Xerxes' messenger ...did not understand this is no typical Greek city-state This is Sparta It was clear to the messenger there'd be no Spartan submission? It was clear Even now Leonidas is in counsel with the Oracle over his battle plan The Festival of the Carneia is all that stands in our way. Surely the Oracle will see we must fight Well, then my timing is perfect I am commanding a fleet of ships that will represent a united Greece I need Sparta to join me Give me your ships, Gorgo l'll make sure that Xerxes wishes he never crossed the Aegean. You'll receive no Spartan ships. We've no interest in a united Greece That is your dream, Themistokles, not ours All I am concerned with is the preservation... of Sparta My guards will see you out lt's funny that you mock freedom here in your selfish isolation Yet freedom, in her wisdom has chosen you to defend her My queen AESKYLOS: Will Sparta join our fight? Apparently the Persians have offered the Spartans something they cannot refuse And what is that? A beautiful death They say you are the bravest of our captives. They say you are a whore from the eastern seas. You're not the smartest Your commander is a Greek Just like me You Persian men take your orders from a Greek woman. Yes, my brother, I am Greek by birth ...and I have Greek blood running through my veins. But my heart is Persian [THUNDER CRASHING] ARTEMISIA Within hours. the Greek fleet will be shattered What of our master and the much-feared Spartans? ARTEMISIA: There's nothing to fear Only King Leonidas and his personal guard of 300 have marched to fight They'll collapse. Instantly You Do you agree? Many will perish Your confidence leaves me with a strong impression. lt's a curious thing for a simple ship guard ...to not lower his eyes when questioned by me That could've been just a lack of discipline But a man's hands do not lie They can reveal ...every imperfection and flaw in his character You see, your hands are not rough enough. to work the rigging of this ship I know every single man beneath my lash Can you explain to me how I don't know you? Forgive me, commander Let me introduce myself Seize the spy [GRUNTING] [vE|_|_s] Coward Storm is upon us lt's just some mad Greek weather [KNOCKING ON DooR] SCYLLIAS: Themistokles -Come. Calisto What is spoken here must not be repeated Anywhere My son has not earned the right to sit at the table of combat veterans -But you can trust him. THEMISTOKLES: Very well -Tell me. A Greek woman commands all of Xerxes' ships to the south. Artemisia I know of her Artemisia is murderous by trade with true skill on the sea... and she has thirst for vengeance Rumors are her entire family ...was murdered by a squad of Greek hoplites I have heard all the stories And the hoplites spared no one on that day [wo|\/IAN SCREAMING] THEMISTOKLES: The story goes that they raped and murdered... her entire family And then they turned their attention towards her. After years of being kept in the bowels of a Greek slave ship... she was discarded and left for dead where she was found near death by a Persian emissary. Artemisia vowed that day to return to Greece... only when she could watch it burn [GRUNTING] She was fed, clothed, trained by the finest warriors of the Persian empire until no match could be found for her skills and gift with the sword The great King Darius was impressed by her commitment. And she quickly rose to command at his side. AESKYLOS: She has sold her soul to Death himself Well, some could say that l've sold mine to Greece And what do you think? -Me? THEMISTOKLES: Yes You are the future of this country l'm ready to fight [THEMISTOKLES CHUCKLES] I like him. He reminds me of you AESKYLOS We will need. every last man He is still just a boy Much younger have defended our country -Enough! You are a dreamer and will speak of this no more Themistokles, l've set your plan in motion And my land force will be assembled by the second day You will be needed. I can assure you of that And there is bad news Leonidas has marched north to the Hot Gates. AESKYLOS: Bad news? With the Spartans .at the Hot Gates, our victory is assured SCYLLIAS: If the army were with him. But between the Oracle and the Carneia Leonidas has marched to Thermopylae with just 300 men. AESKYLOS: So the only thing standing between Athens and total annihilation is Leonidas and 300 Spartans AESKYLOS: I will search out the veterans among them Establish some order among the volunteers THEMISTOKLES: Good. There's little time to teach these farmhands strategy Just keep them well fed and sober AESKYLOS: Anything else? Wouldn't hurt if they could swing a sword. Well, l'll be damned Does your father know that you're here? -No, sir. And this shield and sword? My grandfather's My mother entrusted them to me this morning. When she gave you her blessing? CALISTO: Yes, sir. With a sharp blade, no less Your father is preparing a surprise for our enemy tomorrow. I choose to fight here. Now Come aboard my ship That is where you will fight Yes, sir COMMANDER 1: We've just over 50 ships Persian forces reported a number in the thousands. Those ships appear hardly seaworthy COMMANDER 1: Nothing like the monster ships -...of the Persian fleet. We have the advantage Speed, maneuverability The rest of the city-states have sent anywhere from a handful to a single ship Of course, Athens supplied the balance COMMANDER 2: We have report... _.a small advance force of Persian ships have taken refuge from the storm across the strait. If the weather breaks, we could hit them at dawn An early Greek victory COMMANDER 1: The gods have given us an opportunity ...to wound the Persians, strengthen Greek morale A tempting distraction But we'll stick to the battle plan Today at sundown, we will sail out to meet the main Persian fleet. We'll attack in the open water with no shore to narrow the battle COMMANDER 2: To attack a force of over 1000 ships with our meager force is suicide Such is my plan ARTAPHERN ES: Look at their excuse for a navy ARTEMISIA: Their ships are of little threat I need a second in command, Artaphernes And whoever proves their excellence will earn a place beside me. General Bandari has offered to lead the first attack. Bandan Commander If I let you lead our first offensive ...what guarantee do I have that you'll bring me a quick victory? BANDARI: My word and my life Good My rules of engagement? Humiliate the Greeks and lay waste to their tiny ships BAN DARI: They'll be dead to the last man THEMISTOKLES My brothers. Steady your hearts Look deep into your souls For your mettle is to be tested this day If in the heat of battle you need a reason to fight on an idea for which you will give up all that you will ever have you need only to look at the man who fights at your side. This is the "why" of battle This is the brotherhood of men-at-arms An unbreakable bond made stronger by the crucible of combat You will never be closer than with those who you shed your blood with. For there is no nobler cause ...than to fight for those who will lay down their life for you So you fight strong today You fight for your brothers Fight for your families Most of all, you fight for Greece! ALL: Greece! [ALL sHouT] Yeah! And there is only one thing to make sure of when the fighting starts. What's that? Don't get killed on the first day [MEN |_/-\uoH] That goes for the rest of you Persian ships are strong at the front But they are weak in the middle We attack them there Now! [GRUNTING] Attack! [YELLING] [SCREAMING] [YELLING] Ram them! COMMANDER: Archers, now! Now! [ALL YELL] Reverse! Now! Go through them! [MEN YELL] [MEN SCREAMING] ARTEMISIA: The enemy's tactics are creative The defensive circle leaves no front to assault We are losing No, you are losing Pull back Let them have this day l'm bored with your failures, Bandari l'll not let this wound slow me Heh. Somehow I believe you My blade will be sharp and ready by the morning. Good. Tomorrow you will fight alongside your father. Not bad -...for a bunch of farmers And poets and sculptors Who'd have known untrained men ...would do so well against such a considerable adversary? We're going to need all of our strength for tomorrow's fight. How long do you think we can hold them? If my plan is to work long enough for the Spartans to unite Greece. Men! Who will share their wine with me? [MEN sHouT] Report We are still tallying the losses But you must understand it is extremely difficult... given the sea and the darkness to get an accurate [GRUNTS] Report? ARTAPHERN ES: Seventy-five ships lost Thirty damaged beyond repair Twenty could return with a few weeks' work in a safe harbor. The commander of the Greek force is named Themistokles. Yes, he is an Athenian general He's rumored to have loosed the arrow that felled the great King Darius himself O This Themistokles has shown himself to be quite brilliant in battle. Which is more than I can say for any of you Do you gentlemen find my command unreasonable? ls it too much to ask for victory? Your disappointment in yesterday's losses is warranted My disappointment My disappointment is not with my losses The meager number of damaged ships and dead slaves means nothing to me. No, my disappointment is in these men For though I stand among 10,000 I am alone I long for a soul who would stand by my side Who I could trust Tell me, General Kashani Are you that man? You will taste your victory by the day's end I will make certain of it I hope so [/-\LL GRUNTING] Advance! Now! Don't lose sight of them The Greeks are retreating ARTEMISIA: He's got him right where he wants him Kashani is a fine tactician I was speaking of Themistokles Rocks! Stop, stop! Stop! Brace yourselves! [ALL YELLING] [YELLING] [vELLs] [ALL YELLING AND GRUNTING] [SIGHS] What are you doing here? A man's responsibility is to protect his family and his nation Who told you this? -My father. [GROANING] You see how Themistokles employs deception with such grace? Why is it so much to ask for victory? -How can I make amends? Silence You will carry a message for me MAN: Now they will fear us! Now they will fear the Greek men-at-arms! Hup! THEMISTOKLES He's right. Fear the Greek fighting man Fear his sword His shield Fear his love for Mother Greece But most of all fear his freedom! [/-\LL CHEERING] Don't be angry with the boy I took him under my command Anger is something I reserve for my enemies. Themistokles Artemisia's ship is being anchored in neutral waters. She'd like to meet with Themistokles How can you guarantee his safe return? ARTAPHERNES: Well, boy... the only honor for her now ...will be when she watches your crushed and broken fleet sinking to the bottom of the Aegean and is able to recognize you nailed to the mast of your ship with her sword... as you descend to a watery grave Why didn't you just say that to begin with? ARTEMISIA: Welcome to my humble barge We are honored by your presence Your barge and you are quite impressive Kind words Now come, Themistokles. We have much to discuss Do you believe the Greeks are descended from the gods? I have heard some say that And what of you? ls there a god in your lineage? My men say so, and based on the last two days' battle... l'd say there's a spark of the divine in you Now who's using kind words? My men also say that it was you who slayed the good King Darius at Marathon. Many heroic deeds occurred on that day But it was 10 years ago _.and the facts of battle are often embellished. This deed, you would remember I do what I must to defend Greece And I do what I must to defeat her For every one Greek killed, you must kill a thousand Persians For every ship I sink you must sink a hundred I can sustain losses for weeks Months, if need be My numbers will defeat you and I will take your precious boats with my sword. I will take your Greek freedom Are you asking me to negotiate a surrender? I offer you a chance to avoid such misery and join me l'm in need of a commander such as you Look at the defense you've mounted A handful of triremes Leonidas with 300 Spartans [CHUCKLES] lt's insulting, frankly that the mightiest empire the world has ever seen is met by this. I don't blame you, Themistokles You fought as if the blood of Poseidon himself... was coursing through your veins No, I blame Greece The squabbling bureaucrats protecting their political hides. by sending you here to die And yet you still fight So there must be What? Family back home in Athens that compels you... to battle with such passion? Truth is, l've had no time for family I have spent my entire adult life with my one true love the Greek fleet and my one passion readying it for you UAUGHS] Now, that brings me pleasure the thought of you pining away for me forsaking family and love for the promise of a deeper ecstasy The ecstasy of steel and flesh death and life of rage and sweat of muscle of pure joy and deepest sorrow Die with me each night and be born again with me each morning... ...as you plant your sword into the hearts of our enemies You fight for freedom I offer freedom without consequence or responsibility Join me at my side Breathe each breath with me as if it were your last. Join me [BOTH GRUNTING] You'll not have your death tonight Guards! Remove this filth from my ship [YELLS THEN SWORD CLANGS] AESKYLOS V\/e||’? What have you learned? [SIGHS] Can Artemisia be beaten? The next time that we face her she's going to bring all of hell with her [SIGHS] Hold! Hold! Send in my personal guard Pull back! Retreat! MAN: Retreat! SCYLLIAS: Retreat! MAN: Retreat! SCYLLIAS: Retreat! Themistokles! In the water! Archers on deck now! SCYLLIAS: Archers on deck now! Quickly! THEMISTOKLES Starboard side! Fire at Will!

Abandon ship! Abandon ship! [GRUNTS] GORGO: The dead have no guilt No responsibility Themistokles watches the bodies of his men... turn the Aegean red with blood Were they sacrificed for his ego? Or to relieve the guilt of the long-ago mistake at Marathon? How many men would have been saved if Themistokles had killed that boy? Not even his own soul can be sure My friend We faced the odds [IN STRAINED VOICE] Together. Listen to me Themistokles You will have to fight with twice as much strength in the morning. We will fight shoulder-to-shoulder SCYLUAS: No, my son You will carry on for both of us [SCYLLIAS VVHISPERING INDISTINCTLY] [SOBBING] What did he say? I will tell you in time, boy Quiet now You go and be with your father's spirit How many times do you think we will repeat such a tragedy? As many times as we must We are turning young men into memories Do you think I enjoy this? Witnessing my friend's final breath? Every widow that is made by my decision every child that will grow without a father... they are my choices This is the burden of my command [SQUAWKS] XERXES: How easy it is to silence the strong and self-disciplined Let my army witness the great warriors of Sparta March them past these corpses Let them see the cost of daring to challenge the god-king King Leonidas ...and his brave 300 were the finest Greece has to offer There will be no saviors to rise up and vanquish us Nothing will stop the march of my empire EPHIALTES: Your Majesty XERXES: You, take this dead king's sword to Athens Let them know that I am coming next for them Let them know Athens their prize jewel of a city will disappear from the histories Themistokles! I bring word ...from Thermopylae. Leonidas was betrayed by a hunchback The Spartans have been slaughtered The Hot Gates have fallen Such a sacrifice Now Greece has her martyrs Daxos, take that message from the Hot Gates to every city, every village Let every countryman hear your words But they are dead. All of them Sparta's sacrifice will be what unites us Now go oAxos Hyah! Move all of our ships and men back to the safety of Salamis. And you? I will take Daxos' message to Athens THEMISTOKLES: I was told a hunchback was accountable for the fall of the Hot Gates That he sold out his country _.pulled the crimson from his back and replaced it with Persian gold. What is your name, traitor? Ephialtes of Trachis I should wet this noble blade with your blood. You would be right to do so There is little beauty about me There is little beauty in what I have done Say what you must I beg of you and all of Athens! The god-king will burn this city to the ground! MAN: What does he mean? THEMISTOKLES Quiet yourselves! Leonidas' and Sparta's great sacrifice was no defeat. It was a beautiful victory This simple act of valor will allow us to rally each of our city-states... and unite Greece for one purpose against one enemy! And you You take this message to your god-king That we will take whatever ships we have left... and finish this in the Bay of Salamis But there will be death and destruction Yes, there will be [THUNDER RUMBLING] Themistokles l'm here to speak to your queen A warning, Athenian You may not receive a warm welcome May I offer my deepest sympathies I cannot change what has happened to Leonidas... but his sacrifice will not be forgotten Do not lecture me on sacrifice, and be quick with your words, Athenian I request of you the entire Spartan navy Every man, every ship -...that you can spare. Have I not given enough for your dream of a united Greece? Shall I put swords in the hands of my son? Our children? Would that please you? Have I not given enough for your ambitions, Themistokles? A king Husbands, fathers, brothers Sparta will give no more This belongs with you Avenge him GORGO: The Oracle's words stood as a warning All of Greece will fall as Persian fire reduces Athens to cinder For Athens is a pile of stone and wood and cloth and dust and, as dust, will vanish into the wind Only the Athenians themselves exist And the fate of the world hangs on their every syllable Only the Athenians exist XERXES: The Greeks were fools to stand against us Leonidas and his pride were no match for the will of a god Themistokles was a worthless coward And now ...this pathetic navy is barely worth our attention If that worthless coward had stood at my side... we would have laid the world at your feet EPHIALTES My king. Your humble servant brings you news The Greek fleet are defenseless within the Bay of Salamis You need only finish them Who commands their forces? Themistokles of Athens Themistokles is dead EPHIALTES: He is alive. I have seen him myself We will attack at once Wisdom would have us send a probing force to confirm it is not a trap. You would dare to advise me in matters of war? I am the god-king I am the one who triumphed over Leonidas I am the one who laid waste to this showpiece of Athens -I am your king. ARTEMISIA: Killing Leonidas and his men only made them martyrs And when you razed Athens you set fire to the only thing of value in this country I will attack the Greeks with my entire navy Artemisia Enough! Do not forget who put the crown on your childish head. My king Now sit on your golden throne ...and watch this battle from the safety I provide you THEMISTOKLES: There in the distance we witness the destruction of Athens Alone, we will face the monster that cast a shadow across our land I had prayed that the Spartans would come to lend a hand this morning Perhaps they feel they have given enough COMMANDER 1 You failed us all This is your fault, Themistokles Without Spartans, we're farmhands COMMANDER 2: We should've negotiated with the Persians when we had the chance. You are all right Yes, we are down to a handful of boats And, yes, we are just farmhands We are tradesmen We are boys turned to men through the sacrifice and forge of combat. I played a dangerous game andllosU If you choose to turn your back on me on your country I will not judge you You are free to leave You are still free men Very well Then let us ...put our shoulders to work and free those ships from the bosom of Greece Today is a privilege to call our own A story that will be told for a thousand years. Let our final stand be recorded to the histories And let it be shown that we chose to die on our feet rather than live on our knees! [/-\LL CHEERING] There is only one thing you need to know today Not to get killed No. Your father's last words He told me that you had earned the right to sit at the table. Well, my brother, I have no more tactics or tricks This will be the last battle that we share We have fought next to one other for as long as I can remember. Nothing would please me more than to rest this sword. The preparations that are required? -Below deck. -Good. Are you sure that you want to commit everything? Yes Without Artemisia's command the Persian navy is nothing. AESKYLOS: We will never be able to reach her THEMISTOKLES I will reach her... and put an end to this There will be no room for a retreat I know ARTEMISIA: Today the last Greek ships will be destroyed Show them no mercy Give them no quarter Today we will dance across the backs of dead Greeks.

No one could challenge your skill I would rather die a free man than as a slave. Even if the chain was attached to you GORGO: It begins as a whisper A promise The lightest of breezes dances through the rigging as it creaks above the death cries of 10,000 men. It moves through her hair as gently as a lover's hand That breeze ...that promise, became a wind, a wind that is blown across Greece ...carrying a message told again and again... ...of our Lady Freedom and how wise she was.. to charge Leonidas to lay all at her feet A wind, my brothers, of sacrifice A wind of freedom A wind ofjustice A wind of vengeance MEN [IN UNlSON]: Ah-ooh!
