BASED ON A TRUE STORY IN THE NAME OF THE LAND Pierre! The curtain... Where's the boss? Treating the sheep. He wants to show you the new house. Of course. How's it coming along? Not to his liking, as you might guess. Great to see you, son. You like it? Your father likes it. But do you like it? It's modern. Don't worry, you can bring your hens. - Like to help? - Sure. Here... What time did you rise on your ranch? 5 AM. Then continue. It's the jetlag. Hey, girls! The what? Jetlag. The time difference. All Greek to me. Lift her up. A herd of 500 must seem nothing to you now? No... Dad, I'm done with the US. You can't compare. How many head did your rancher have? 10,000. Bloody hell! 10,000! - No, you can't compare. - And this farm is a gem. It's my home, it's not the same. In annex are the financial conditions and the repayment schedule for the loan. 1,300,000 Francs... We agree on the amount? It is also agreed that you purchase all the equipment as is plus the animals? I also prepared the leasehold agreement. 1,000 Francs per hectare annually. That still stands? Well, if it's in writing. Hello... Sorry I'm late. Have a seat. Hello. So we'll move on to the signing. Initial the bottom of each page and sign the last. Thank you. You're now owner of Grands Bois farm! Mother, pour us a drink! Let me help. Stay where you are, I'll do it. Thank you. To Grands Bois farm! What matters, is that it stays in the family. Here, grab this. One more. I'll take the rest. - Here. - I pour it all in? Yeah, the whole lot. Okay... Hey, careful! That costs money. You're spilling the half of it. Are we good? Tilt it sideways, it'll splash less. Okay, go! Dare devil! 120... 121... 122... 123... 124.. 125... 126... Gotcha! 127... 128... Come here, you. 129... And 130! Are we good? Does it add up? 130, we're good Mr Jarjeau! That's the Lira exchange rate? Look... It's dropped again. The only ones who eat goat are the Italians. And the French? Eh, Medhi? They don't go for goat! - Well, until next time. - Bye. What a shot! See that? Look. - What? - Handlebar gear shift. So? That's what I need for racing. Everyone has it. That's why I lose. Oh, that's why. You think I'll buy you a pro bike? Yeah, for Christmas. I'm not Santa Claus. Go on! Pass! Yes! Goal! Double! Hat-trick! - What's so funny? - I'll teach you! Hey, mind the book! I saw your boyfriend. - Stop it! - Don't want your dessert? - Really? - Outside the school. Wow, that stinks! What is it? - Always the same old tricks. - Yeah. And you fall for it every time. Not forgetting something? Come on. And this... - The whole lot? - Yeah. Order the milk powder? No. - I told Medhi to tell you, 10 tons. - Yeah... But I didn't, as we've no cash in hand. How come? We're flat broke. How do I explain that to my goats? We've got to order some. We'll find a solution. But what I intend to do, Mr Martin is to renegotiate my prices with the abattoir and in a year, we can be one of the biggest goat breeders in the region. Fine, Mr Jarjeau, but in the meantime? Too many cash advances are not good on top of all the loans. It's just to tide me over the winter and feed my animals. And your leasehold is due soon. Am I wrong? 78,000 Francs. Mr Jarjeau... Can't you ask you father for a deferment? Or even a payment freeze until things pick up? I mean, you are family. And as your dad is not in need. No, you're right. I can work something out with him. But that aside, I reckon I can better amortize the buildings. In summer, with the goats gone we could fit in another activity, see? Something regular, that puts a cheque in the bank every month. Backed by the Co-op and the Chamber of Agriculture. That changes everything, Mr Jarjeau! Good, let's set up another meeting. - What's up? - Were you serious? - About what? - A new activity? Of course. The Co-op can't wait to green light it. - A turnkey chicken-breeding activity. - And new loans to go with it. You could've spoken to me first. I'm your wife, your accountant. Honestly, Pierre. With all the other loans and EU compliance... To hell with EU compliance, this is our project! - We've no other choice. - We always have a choice. The solution to our problems is not your chicken coop it's your father! Go ask him for help, like Mr Martin said. But we got the cash advance. That's what we came for. Live your life. Our life. There are two more here a hit sickly. Hope we lose fewer than last year. Or the old man will bore me again with his sheep. Well sheep are hardier than kid goats. But they're dumb as hell. - Well, see you tomorrow. - Yeah, goodnight. By the way, how's your wife? She's fine. So, tell me. She found a job in town. - That's great! - Yeah, secretary to a lawyer. Why didn't you tell me? I'm telling you now. - Goodnight. - See you. Off you go. There you go. If you could cash it at month end I'd appreciate it. - No problem. - Thanks, bye. Ready? I heard you're planning... to expand? What's all that about? You want to get deeper in debt? If you think I'm too deep in debt you know what to do. Me, I didn't inherit. Let me stop you right there. This farm was worthless! My father, he had... 3 cows and a pig... barely a hectare of land. Grands Bois farm was my doing. You want me to just gift you a lifetime of work? That female's given you big notions. - Don't you insult my wife... - Don't tell me what to do! As long as you're on my land, I'll have my say. Since you took over... nothing's right. If I'd listened to you, I'd be dead. As would Grand Bois. Your slavery days are over. I'm an entrepreneur, I invest. I adapt to the market, move ahead. Like it or not. An entrepreneur! That's the best yet. We're farmers! Want a drop? Do as you like. I just hope it works out. - Hello, is this Grand Bois farm? - Yes. I've come to see Mr Jarjeau. That's my husband, but he's out. He told me to drop by... I'll wait. - And you are? - Matthieu Sens, ChickenStar rep. Okay, he shouldn't be too long. - Thanks. - Have a good day. - You seem kind of... - Kind of what? Strange. Really? No, I'm fine. So, what's the matter? You and Pierre? No, we're fine, it's just... There's no end to what we have to deal with. Accounting here, accounting there... I don't know how you do it. Lucky I have this accounting job, it's how I fill the larder. Well, better get started. Here we are. Wow! - How many? - 2,000. From Easter on it's empty, so it's got potential. Indeed. Only it'd have to be fitted out. - Meaning? - It'd be hard to amortize 6-monthly. You should think bigger, do both at once. Chickens and goats. With a brand new building! What's behind there? There we have the sheds. - Want to see? - Sure. Otherwise, there's the plot below. Right. It's buildable? Yeah. It's perfect. See? You've got access. Water and power lines too. It's ideal. 300,000 Francs is a very different sum. But for that you have a 1,000 sq. metre building new, equipped, usable all year round, no comparison. Plus a Government modernization grant to cover a third of the outlay. That still leaves 200,000 to find. - The bank won't risk it. - With our backing they will. We ensure sale. And fast turnover. Right, then... My son, Thomas. Future farmer? - Studying agriculture. - At Rochefeuille? I went there too. Mr Sens, I have work to do. - Call you in a few days? - You have my number. Young man. Who's he? A guy to get us out of a hole. Jeez, a duck! 300,000 Francs... It's madness. But you don't want to hear. Well, it's either that... or we lose 15 years of investment. It's not just the money, it's 100,000 chickens a year! Plus the crops and the goats! You're already overworked. You think I can't handle it? No... - It means hiring more people. - Then we'll hire. It's we who bear the risks, not them. FRANCE FROM THE SKY - For your dad. - Yeah... He'll love it. "France From the Sky". Might change his views. Can you put your finger? Where? You can be so silly. - You have to talk to him. - To who? Who? Your father! About the leasehold. I will when the time is right. Meaning, never. First, we need new revenues. Yes... I'm not against it. But it needs serious thought. Look at Jean-Paul, or Roland, they're all expanding. I don't want to be the straggler. Champions of the world! Come on! What kept you? Nothing... I just let you win. - And my back tyre is soft. - Sure, Pacino! Pacino, look what I brought you. Yes... You're so pretty. Hey, I can see your new building... And that crane in your yard... has everybody talking. Some say your dad's too cocky. They'd just like to do the same. Even your dad. I doubt it. Well you will, when you take over. You have to modernize. Not eager to take over? No, I'll take my time. But why study agricultural engineering? All you need is a high-school diploma. Engineering interests me. You're just like your dad. Let's go. Ciao, Pacino. Wanna climb the Vidou? The Vidou! Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday to you... Happy birthday dear Emma... - Congratulations, my sweet. - Thanks, Dad. You're the prettiest. Who wants apple pie? Who made the apple pie? Suzanne? I sure want apple pie. It needs a little cinnamon. Watch out! - Granddad's not happy. - In France we add cinnamon. - I'm just saying... - But if you had done he'd have moaned just the same! Please... Please! Give it back, he'll get sunstroke. Okay, back to front. Rapper style! Cheers, Granddad! Drinking... at his age. For my blister's birthday! Can you believe it? Thirteen. 13 years of pestering! Come visit my building, the guided tour! Come and see! Come on in! The entire circuit is automated. The pellets are piped in... from the silos outside into the hoppers where a photoelectric cell triggers the delivery. From there, the rations are fed into the troughs. And the same for the water, via these droppers here. It's all adjustable. Yeah, you can adjust the trough height... Got your eye on Sarah? Careful, Mehdi's watching! You're such a dick! Just kidding! Those little plaits? Shut it. - How many chickens? - 20,000. - The chicks arrive Tuesday. - And the breeding time? 35 days, to reach over 2 kilos. What do they eat to grow so fast? Pellets, a mix of wheat, corn, soya, animal flours, vitamins, and so on. - The Co-op delivers, hassle free. - Well, fancy that. So, come see the control room. The nerve centre. Step over! Tipplers take care, eh Gran? There we go! Gran's not the only drunkard! So is the missus! Hey, guy! - How's it going? - Hey. - Wow! Nice job. - 5 hours of work. - I'm impressed. - Coming in? - No swim suit. - Come on, it's nice. I've no trunks. Stop! It's freezing! Come on, cycle man! First in! You run too fast! In the swim! Come on, Rémy! And now? No go! God dammit! And now? No, shut it off! - Shut off! - Yeah, hold on... Is it off? Yeah! Well? Try again. - First, take your fingers out. - Of course. Well? It's okay. It's okay? Yeah, I took my fingers out. - Think that's funny? - Yeah. - Are you stupid or what? - Yeah. - It's not fucking funny! - Yes it is. I don't care if it's the weekend, my chickens have to eat! Yes, I'm annoyed, because... I pay ChickenStar a fortune for a new installation that doesn't work! So, what do I do? When? Are you kidding me? Feed 20,000 chickens by hand! You're sorry? Yeah, sure... Asshole! Why not use our wheat? I've a contract with the Co-op. That bothers you? No. It must, you already asked me. - Heard you're in trouble? - From who? Common knowledge. I don't need help. A farmer never refuses a hand. That's not enough. Aren't they fat enough? You want to help me, fill the troughs. Okay? Look at that stuff. If I were a chicken I wouldn't touch it! If people only knew. People get their money's worth. How many per square metre? What's this? An inspection? 20, it's the norm. The norm now is to produce rubbish! "I'm expanding." If you'd only listened to me instead of falling for the system. Now they have you! What do you want? What are you after? Look at the state of this thing. Take a good look. Are you proud? Are you proud? How could you be proud? I was proud of my sheep. Your sheep full of antibiotics and your steroid veal! That's what paid your land and house! You were up to your neck in the system! So don't preach to me! I did what I decided to do. At least, I was free! What are you trying to prove? What do you want? Don't come fucking with me! Go! You hold your tongue! - Or I'll smack you one! - Beat it! - Get the hell out of here! - Easy. Get off my farm! Right, then go it alone! I never asked you for anything. I never asked, you hear? And you never gave! Just let him talk. Anyway, he'll always find fault. He has nothing better to do, all alone in his house, except plague me like he did my mom until the end. He can't wait till I fuck up. But I won't give him the pleasure. Don't let it get to you. You won't change him. Go wash. You stink! Just wait till we're rich and buy out his land. Imagine the look on his face. We're good, go ahead! Now, it's all yours! It drives itself, see? Don't do that! We'll pulling 10 tons, if we crash, I'll blame you. - I'm areal pro. - You're doing great. - Real good! - Hey, don't do that! Come on, sweetie, Step down... - Hi, Pierre. - Hi, Rémy. Hi. We work for nothing at 700 Francs a ton. Last year we were getting 800. Anyway, we'll always get shafted. Unless we set the price... - Your dad lets you out? - Sure, why? I'd be wary of this guy. He's a real skirt chaser. He's only kidding. But he's a whiz in math. Yeah, he's the best. He'll be giving you lessons. - Right, Mr Engineer? - Lay off... For now, it's tractor lessons. I see. Tractor lessons! What's keeping them? I've work to do. And a storm's brewing. It should hold. Yeah, like your glass eye! Jean-Louis, you're weighed. You can go. Better harvest a maximum today! So, when will it be signed? You don't know? Madam... I want that cheque by Friday latest. That's right. Thank you, goodbye. What a halfwit! Advance payment - wheat Weekend at the seaside cancelled Hey, guys! Time to eat! Thomas! Turn it down a bit. Go get your dad, supper's ready. Yeah, after the highlights. - Emma can go. - No, I'm tired. Pierre? Pierre! My love... Talk to me! It's al right... - Let me help you. - I'm fine. Let me... 30149... What's your usual? 120180. Mr Jarjeau, you need to rest. - Especially with this heat... - Rest? When does Dr Rousseau get back? Soon, but he'll tell you the same. No, he won't, he knows a farmer just can't down tools. What if you end up in hospital? I won't, just give me a booster. Mr Jarjeau, I'm saying this for your own good. I know you've work to do, but you can't even stand! I'm here to help, not to hinder. Listen to him. Please. So who'll run the farm? He will? Do you often get that? That trembling? These past few days. - Where are you going? - The hell out! I'm not sick, just give me some vitamins! I'm sorry. He needs rest... I'll prescribe some sleeping pills. And something else... but not vitamins. Hey, Thomas. It's been a while. Want a beer? Whisky and coke. Whisky and coke it is! There you go. Rémy, stop! What's up? It's the farm! Fucking hell! The farm! The goat shed is on fire... Dad! My husband is inside, with the goats and so is our farmhand. Come quickly, please! Mom! Did you call the fire brigade? - Where's Dad? - He's inside! Stay! Don't go in there! Stop! Calm down. Claire, here! - Thomas! - Pierre! Stop! Let go of me! Here, grab this! Thomas! Pierre, leave it! Dad, stop! Get out of there! Leave it! Get out! Thomas, get out! Get back! Stay back. Holy fuck! I don't believe it... - Hi, guys. - Hey. Hi, Pierre. Well? Didn't put you in jail? No... Are you okay? I'm okay. They restructured our debt, for another 12 years. It's tough for everyone, but we'll pull through. Right, Daniel? - I'll tell you after the hearing. - Sure, - I'm sick of it all. - Got a smoke? Mustn't let it get to you. - Smoking now? - Yeah, see. What're you doing? - Hey! - What? See you round. Take it easy, Pierre. Bankruptcy is no big deal. Okay, we've got 2 million Francs to repay but at least the judge deemed the farm viable so all our efforts weren't in vain. That's what matters. And 12 years will fly by... Friday 1st - Bank Holiday Didn't get up Didn't get up - A wreck Got up - Smoked - Didn't eat Got up to eat - A zombie Went back to bed Dad's still sleeping? Yes. He got up, smoked 3 cigarettes and went back to bed. Why? Mehdi and I are preparing the coop. The chicks are arriving early, so we're flat out. Okay, I made sandwiches, they're in the fridge. I'm going into town for the insurance and to get your sister. Need anything? - No, it's fine, thanks. - Okay. What are you doing? I'm out of smokes. And so you act like a bum? Look at you, Pierre. You stink, you're filthy. Don't touch me! You disgust me. I'm sick of it, I can't take any more. Neither can the kids. We do everything... And you do nothing. Please go and wash. I've never seen that photo. Take it if you like. When your mother died, he prescribed me God knows what. I said I never set foot in a pharmacy and wasn't about to. I never took that rubbish. That's what throws you. The key is not to give in to yourself, but to work. Work! Work is the only cure. I too had my share of blows. Falling prices, droughts... Foot and mouth disease in '52... Each time, it was back to work. - Because I don't work? - I didn't say that. You work badly. I've told you many times. And now you have the result. So now you'll do what the Jarjeaus have always done, you dust off, knuckle down and work twice as hard. Me, at thirteen when your grandfather died... I took his place. At the age of 13. There was no shirking it. Your problems can't compare. During the war... when your uncle and I used to smuggle "topines" to the resistance fighters... Know what "topines" are? rutabagas, topinambours. By night, 20 kms on foot... I know, you already told me. Yep... And once we hid out all night... in the snow. They were flushing out the woods up at... La Monnerie. My chicken's no good? No doubt better than mine. What did you want to ask me? Nothing. Eat up, it's going cold. What're you doing? Scoot! Go and do your homework. Mom! Where's Dad? Thomas! Seen Dad? He's not in his room. Dad! Pierre! Pierre! Dad! Dad! Speak to me! Dad! Are you okay? Look at me... For fuck's sake! Mom's worried. You're such a pain. Come on, let's go home. Let's go, it's cold. Come on, can you stand? Up you get! Fucking hell! Hold on... Take it easy... No, what're you doing? To hell with those! Hold on... Stay where you are... I got it. Let's go, nice and easy... That's right... I'm al right. No, you're not fucking al right. Come on... No, this way... Al right... I can do it myself, I'm not sick. Help me. You like this, huh? That he sees me like this? Like a loser, like a bum? I'm going sell this damn place and you can go. Do you hear? You'll go! - Come... - I won't bother you anymore! Let him calm down. Yeah, calm down... To hell with you all! He doesn't mean it, he loves us, you know that. Come. I'm afraid for the kids, afraid I'll snap... it's terrifying to see their father fallen so low! Where are you going? Taking the afternoon off. - Wow! Mr Good-looking! - Don't rub it in... Fell into the gel pot? - You look great! - And the tie? You're great... Right... - Off we go! - Where? Valérie's wedding, I told you. And me? You said you wanted to stay home, not see anyone. No, I'll come with you. But we're already late, we can't wait for you. No, I'm coming, I like Valérie. But Dad, you can't come in that state. You're not shaved, or washed. - Wait, I'll get dressed. - Dad, please! You're ashamed of me? No, just be reasonable, please. So you're all in league against me? You're totally stoned, in no state to come! Don't talk to your father like that! You're not leaving here without me. What are you doing? What's all this? - Give me that knife... - Back off! - Give me that damn knife! - Back off! Or I'll do myself in! You're crazy... Totally crazy! You scare us! Going without me? Shut the fuck up! Pierre! Open up! Open the door! They're going without me! No, they won't leave you. Mehdi, open the door! Let go of me! Thomas, let go! Let go! Drop that knife! Drop it! Pierre, stop! What the hell's got into you? Calm down! Stop! Fucking hell... They're leaving me. Don't worry, they won't leave you. Calm down. It'll be al right. Come... Come. I just want it to stop. He's exhausted. For months now, morally, physically, totally... demotivated. He... closes himself in a darkened room and gets up at night... I don't know what he does... He smokes. And... he can't work like he used to... When he tries to help on the farm... he messes up. He's even dangerous. The knife, was it the first time? Yes. Yes, the first time but he drinks on top of his medication and sometimes... he gets aggressive. But it's not... It's not him. He's not an aggressive man... He loves his children. But when he gets that way, it's scary. Any problems in your relationship? No. That's a load of crap! My mother's not to blame! Okay? She's not to blame! He's sick from work! Working for nothing! Let me speak. Farming means zero to you! Come on. I'm sorry. - He's a hit... - Normal. It's a normal reaction. How long will you keep him in? However long it takes. Once he stabilizes, we could envisage a 10-day release. But no visits before then. We need a total break. You look cool in that one. The cowboy! That's you on the right? Second from the right. Not your shorts, Emma? They're your shorts. I loved that pickup. That's my favourite. Tell me... When will you return? Tell me... Do you even know? That the time that slips away Can never be held on to That all the time we've lost Can never be made up for Though I'll love you, ever and always Love you and you alone If you do not see fit to return We shall become but a sweet memory I head out info a world of wonder Warm myself beneath another sun I am not one to die of heartbreak Nor have I the virtue of a sailor's wife You had a field day in my absence. What? To talk bullshit! Yeah. I warn you, if I hear any more rumours that I set fire to my shed to get the insurance money I'll be down banging on your door. I don't fucking care if you're the mayor! As if farms never catch fire. So take good care of your village, your farm and your wife, as I hear she needs it! Rest assured, we're not dead yet! Bloody yokel! When can we rebuild? What for? To make a living. For that... the only solution is to leave. And that's what you'll do. Work hard, finish your studies and leave this hole. But Dad, you can count on me to take over Grands Bois. No, I don't want you to take over. Understand? I don't want my son living the lousy life I did. Grands Bois is finished, it's in the past. Leave, there are far more interesting things to do. Believe me. I should've told the old man to stuff it and never returned. I'd be in Wyoming galloping across the plains far from this dung heap. And Mom? Your mom? Look at her life. Think I made her happy? And Emma? And me? Come on, help me. Grab the other end. He said, "Next week, I'll win!" Then he quit after two laps. Saying, "I'm beat!" "I've had enough!". - Like you. - I never quit. I'm not a quitter... I never give up. I'm a Jarjeau. Thomas! Dad, what is it? What's the matter? Dad! Thomas, I don't want to die... - I don't want to die. - What? What did you do? What? Out there... - What? - Out there... Out there? What the hell did you take? What was it? Mom! It hurts! It hurts. Easy does it, I'm here. Mom! Mom! What? What is it? Pierre! What did you do? What did he swallow? Thomas! - What did he do? - I don't know. What did you do, Pierre? Out there... Mom? Come... No, stay here. Okay, I understand... Forgive me... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Glyphosate... Fipronil... And... I don't know... I don't know... Look at me... Dad! Dad, come on... For fuck's sake, Dad, get up! Dad! Get up! Get up! Fuck! No! Can you come quickly? TO MY FATHER, CHRISTIAN it's strange to see so many folks in here today as this winter there was a lot more goats than the heads and hands I see before me. So, it's a real pleasure to have so many people sharing this moment of relaxation. So I hope you all enjoy yourselves welcome and come back soon. Thank you again to Christian...
