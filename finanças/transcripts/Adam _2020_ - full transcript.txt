Give me back my glove! Try it, fat ass! Adam! I will kill you if you do not give me back my glove! That is me, Adam. I was one fat, angry little fuck. Try it, fat ass! I will kill you! Adam! I just mopped this floor. Leave your brother alone! Jerry! Jerry, do something. That is my brother Ross. I think the little dance says it all. Ross, let your brother in the house. Adam! Hey, thank you for calling. Are you looking to purchase or refinance today? Will you be on the loan by yourself or with your wife? This is what the appraiser is going to look for and I want to make sure. Were you majorly renovating the house or it does it need any structural repairs. We need to look at income, assets and credit. Everything. Taking a look at your pay stubs, income. Everything looks great. Your credit score is going to get you a great rate. Visible water damage or like chipped and peeling paint? Let us see what we can approve you for. That is going to save you over sixty five hundred dollars over the next five years. You are in awesome hands. We will take fantastic care of you. No worries. Would you like the appraiser to come Thursday or come Saturday? May I fax or mail you the documents? As far as the deposit, do you want to use a credit card or a debit card? Congratulations on your new mortgage. It has been a pleasure and I look forward to seeing you through the process. It is a very good question. Um look, the money you save in the first two years will cover any raise the adjustable mortgage may undergo. It may not even go up. That is dependent on the market. In my experience it often stays right where it is. It could even go down. Yeah. Yes I have actually seen it go down. I have all the time in the world for you Mrs. Lennick. Shit. Mrs. Lennick, Mrs. Lennick. If I did not care I would not have given you my cell phone number. Right? And I would not have answered your call this morning or on any of the other mornings for the past one hundred and eighty days. Perfect. Ok. Go ahead. Perfect. Ok. Great. Talk soon. A mortgage, typically is the largest financial transaction of the clients life. Your correct handling of these things that freak them out will put the client at ease. Adam, glad to see you could make it. Sorry, I was just on the phone. Do not chase money. Become an expert. Trust me, the money will follow. If you just chase numbers and you chase money you will just end up you know spinning in circles and chasing your tail. And you will also end up late to sales meetings. Alright, that is ten thirty. The west coast leads will be queued up shortly. Be at your desks and dialed in. Adam. He just told me that you know there are just much higher expectations of me because I have the most potential. So I told him that I closed Mrs. Lennick. That is a shit lead, ok? I threw her name out six months ago. That is because Nick Kahn, everybody, sucks at selling mortgages. Right, Nick? Alright, I just do not waste my time. On completely viable clients? What the hell does Mickey care about some seventy thousand dollar mortgage? Because she may have only been seventy thousand dollars, her boss is looking at three million dollar homes in Bloomfield Hills. Shots! Can I get you a cranberry juice, Nick? Hey uh, shots of Chivas, please? So, guess who I saw at the Lark last night. Is this going anywhere or you just want me to know that you were at the Lark? It was my nanna's birthday, ok? But at the valet, I ran into Henry Schoeler. Two bit hack. Two bit or no, he was picking up his Lamborghini. What? Really? The guy left Fidelity with a list full of names stuffed in his pants and opened up his own shop. Wait, has Fidelity noticed that he is poaching their clients? Well it does not really matter. It would be too expensive to prosecute and what is a million a year to them, right? Well that takes some balls. Cheers. This is on you, Chief. Excuse me. Hi. Bathroom is over there. No, I was just You see, you caught my eye from across the bar. Did anyone check your ID? Is that a line? Excuse me? I mean if you wanted to know my name you could just ask.

What did you get? Cappuccino. Oooh, that sounds good. What is that, exactly? I am always confused by the cappuccino and the Americano with the macchiato and the other thing.

I brought you up here because I would like you to be Franks replacement. Director? It is more work but it is more rewarding. And on occasion people will disappoint you. The responsibillity will be to either improve their performance or let them go. Your friends, Adam. Stay focused. See the long view. I think I am gonna buy that building. Adam. Hey, Adam. Hey, check this. Plasma screen, pin ball machine, outdoor pizza oven. It is a lake house not a Shakeys. If anything, it would be a Chuck E. Cheese.

Oh, okay. Blah. Blah. Blah. What is point? I intend on becoming fully independent. I am having the entire house redone just for that purpose. But, being independent means I need you. Just come back.

Um, I did not know what to say. You know even if I did come back to work. My performance would be non- existent. No. I do not believe that. I do not need the money, if that is what this is about. I have no idea what it is you deal with on a daily basis. But, what I do know is that you bring a lot of valuable intangibles to the company. You can hang a zero for production for all I care, Adam. But, you have no idea of the impact that you make on the people arouund the office. Thank you. As unfortunate as your accident was, at least you are alive for the next opportunity. Your job will be waiting for you. When you are ready for it. I uh, did work pretty hard for that promotion. Oh, no. No. No. That is gone. Cannot have a team without a leader. If another director spot opens up eventually, and if you decide to come back, I have no doubt that it will be yours. Well, um. I will think about it. Hmm. No. No. I will get the door. Hey, uh. Thanks, Mickey. I mean it. Yevgeniya. Doorbell. Adam this is obvious. Hello, stranger. I get coat. Adam, I just did not... You do not need to apologize. I am ashamed about what I did. Will you forgive me? You know, I uh, I hated you for a long time. And I thought about it, and if, if this had happened to you, I would not have stuck around. Woah. How are we on time? Um. 23 minutes. And? You tell me. We have lift off. Really? Uh Hmm. Oh my god. Is it in? Yeah. How does it feel? Good. And you? I feel wonderful. Hey. Hey. I gotta run. Christine? Yeah? Um. It is not gonna work. Last night. It. It was the first time in a long time that I felt good about myself. Being with a quadriplegic is not going to make you a better person. I am sorry. Me too. You are late. Sorry. It will not happen again.
