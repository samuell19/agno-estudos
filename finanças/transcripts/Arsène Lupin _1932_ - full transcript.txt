DID YOU FIND ANYTHING DOWN THERE? SOME WELL-DEFINED FOOTPRINTS HERE, SIR. ALL RIGHT. DEVELOP THEM AND GIVE THEM TO ME AS SOON AS YOU CAN. YES, SIR. NOW THEN, WHAT HAPPENED? I GOT HIT OVER THE HEAD, AND WHEN I CAME TO, A MAN WAS JUST LEAVING THE ROOM. WAS THAT THE MAN? THIS IS IDIOTIC. I'M THE DUKE OF CHARMERACE. WAS THAT THE MAN? I DON'T THINK SO, SIR. HE LOOKED BIGGER, AND HE WALKED WITH A LIMP. YOU'D BETTER REMEMBER THAT, MR. POLICEMAN. HE LIMPS. NOW THEN, ARSENE LUPIN, I'LL TALK TO YOU. WHEN YOU DO, TAKE OFF YOUR HAT. CALL ME SIR. I BEG YOUR PARDON, SIR. DOES THAT SATISFY YOU? HMM? ARE YOU HAPPY AND CONTENTED NOW... ARSENE LUPIN? LOOK HERE... YOU'VE CHEATED ME AND TRICKED ME AND MADE A FOOL OF ME FOR YEARS. NOW I'VE GOT YOU RED-HANDED. HA HA! THE DUKE OF CHARMERACE. HA HA HA! "I'VE JUST RETURNED FROM THE OPERA." HA HA HA! WELL, CROOK, THIS IS THE END OF THE GAY LIFE FOR YOU.

MONSIEUR HENRI PIERRE DU CHARMERACE, DUKE DE LA BASTILLE. STOP MAKING SUCH A FOOL OF YOURSELF AND TAKE OFF THESE HANDCUFFS, OR TOMORROW, I'LL SEE THAT YOU LOSE YOUR BADGE. I'LL TAKE 'EM OFF WHEN I HAVE YOU SAFELY BEHIND BARS, AND NOT BEFORE. VERY WELL, MY FRIEND- ONLY REMEMBER THAT ANYTHING THAT HAPPENS TO YOU AFTER THIS, YOU ASKED FOR IT. WHAT'S HAPPENED? CHARMERACE! WELL, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? CH-CH-CHARMERACE? NOT TDUKE OF CHARMERACE? NOBODY BUT A DODDERING ASS WOULD THINK I WAS ARSENE LUPIN. HERE. ARSENE LUPIN? ARE YOU SURE THAT HE'S THE DUKE OF CHARMERACE? OF COURSE I'M SURE. YES, AND I DON'T LIMP. I- I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO SAY, YOUR GRACE. I DON'T KNOW HOW TO APOLOGIZE. OH, THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I PRESUME YOUR STUPIDITY ALL COMES UNDER THE HEAD OF DUTY. IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, YOUR GRACE. GLADLY. YOU KNOW, THE JOKE OF IT IS, I HAVEN'T BEEN ROBBED AT ALL. OH, REALLY? NO! ALL MY JEWELS AND BONDS ARE DOWN AT MY PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. OH. THAT SEEMS LIKE AN EXCELLENT PLACE TO KEEP THEM. WELL? THERE ARE NO FINGERPRINTS HERE, SIR. YOU KNOW, IF I WERE YOU, I'D GO DOWN THERE AND GUARD THOSE JEWELS, AND I'D TAKE SOMEONE WITH ME - SOMEONE I COULD TRUST. YOU WOULD? I WONDER YOU DON'T OFFER TO GO, YOUR GRACE. YOU'VE BEEN SO HELPFUL WITH YOUR SUGGESTIONS AND ADVICE. I CAN'T GO MYSELF. I'M GIVING A BALL TOMORROW NIGHT. OH, I WOULDN'T DREAM OF INTERFERING WITH YOUR DANCING. OH, I DON'T DANCE ALL THE TIME. BESIDES, IT SEEMS TO ME YOU'RE THE MAN ABOVE ALL OTHERS WHO SHOULD BE MOST INTERESTED IN GOING- THAT IS, IF IT ISN'T TOO FAR. OH, THERE IS THE LONG ARM OF THE LAW, YOUR GRACE. TRUE. THERE ARE ALSO THE NIMBLE FINGERS OF ARSENE LUPIN. AHH. HAVE YOU GOT THE DATA IN THE LUPIN CASE? I'LL HAVE IT FOR YOU IN A MOMENT, SIR. THE MAN WEIGHS BETWEEN 185 AND 195 POUNDS. HEIGHT 5' 9" TO 5' 11". HE WEARS BROAD-TOED SHOES, SIZE 101/2. THE FOOTPRINTS SHOW A DEEPER IMPRESSION ON THE RIGHT FOOT. THE MAN PROBABLY LIMPS. ANYTHING ELSE? YES. THE IMPRESSION SHOWS 5 HOBNAILS SET IN A SEMICIRCLE IN THE RIGHT HEEL. WHAT? NO. THAT'S ALL RIGHT. ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU. UH, CAN I LOOK AT THE CAST OF THAT SHOE, PLEASE? CERTAINLY. HERE IT IS. I THINK I'LL TAKE THE CAST OF THE IMPRESSION, TOO. PARDON ME. IT'S THIS ONE. THANK YOU. WELL, WHAT IS IT? NOTHING, SIR. GOOD MORNING, GUERCHARD. WHAT ABOUT LAST NIGHT? WELL, HE GOT AWAY AGAIN, AS USUAL. OH. BUT IT WON'T HAPPEN AGAIN. YES. SAME OLD STORY. NO. THIS TIME, I HAVE A VERY GOOD DESCRIPTION OF HIM. HE WEIGHS 190 POUNDS, WEARS A SIZE 101/2 SHOE WITH A BROAD SOLE, AND WALKS WITH A LIMP IN HIS RIGHT FOOT. IS THIS THE CAST OF HIS SHOE? YES. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. MM-HMM. LOOK HERE. LOOK AT THIS. SEE THOSE HOBNAILS? YES, I SAW THEM. IT OUGHT TO BE EASY TO FIND THAT MAN. YES. UNFORTUNATELY, THERE ARE A GREAT MANY MEN IN PARIS WHO ARE LAME. I KNOW. I KNOW. BUT LOOK AT THOSE MARKS ON THAT HEEL. I TELL YOU, GUERCHARD, ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO ARREST THE FIRST MAN YOU FIND WITH A HEEL LIKE THAT. OBVIOUSLY. BUT FIRST OF ALL, I HAVE TO FIND HIM. HOWEVER, THIS TIME, I HAVE A VERY DEFINITE CLUE. I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE. YEAH. LAST NIGHT, HE TRIED TO ROB GOURNEY-MARTIN'S HOUSE. HE WAS AFTER THE FAMOUS EMERALD NECKLACE, BUT HE DIDN'T GET IT BECAUSE THE NECKLACE WASN'T THERE. IT WAS DOWN AT GOURNEY-MARTIN'S PLACE IN THE COUNTRY. HMM. I SEE. AND THAT'S WHERE I'M GOING TO FIND HIM, BECAUSE THAT'S JUST WHERE HE'S GOING NEXT. OH... IS IT? WHAT ARE YOU GOING TO DO ABOUT THAT? YESTERDAY, THE PRESIDENT SENT FOR ME AND WANTED TO KNOW WHY I HAVEN'T CAPTURED ARSENE LUPIN, AND I'M PASSING IT ON TO YOU. WHY HAVEN'T YOU CAUGHT HIM? I WILL CATCH HIM. I'LL GIVE YOU A WEEK, GUERCHARD. A WEEK. OH, I COULDN'T PROMISE THAT. I DON'T WANT A PROMISE. I WANT ARSENE LUPIN HERE AS A PRISONER WITH HANDCUFFS ON HIM IN A WEEK. I'LL DO MY BEST. THAT ISN'T ENOUGH. IT'S A STRANGE THING, GUERCHARD. YOU CAN ALWAYS CAPTURE EVERY OTHER CROOK IN PARIS, BUT EACH TIME YOU GO AFTER ARSENE LUPIN, YOU FAIL. YOU'VE FAILED FOR THE LAST TIME. UNLESS THAT MAN IS HERE WITHIN A WEEK, I'LL BREAK YOU. AFTER ALL MY YEARS OF SERVICE? YES. IN A MONTH, I'LL HAVE SERVED 25 YEARS- A QUARTER OF A CENTURY. I WAS LOOKING FORWARD TO MY PENSION, GOING DOWN TO THE COUNTRY AND LIVING WITH MY DAUGHTER IN PEACE AND QUIET AWAY FROM ALL THIS- YOU CAN HAVE ALL OF THAT FOR ARSENE LUPIN. OH, GIVE ME A MONTH. IN A MONTH, HE COULD ROB ALL OF PARIS, TAKE MILLIONS OF FRANCS. I'LL GIVE YOU A WEEK, GUERCHARD. ONE WEEK. REMEMBER THAT. YOU LOOK ADORABLE TONIGHT. YOUR GRACE. WHERE ARE THEY? WELL? HAVE YOU BOYS REHEARSED THIS? WHAT HAVE YOU GOT THIS TIME? IT'S TOO BAD, YOUR GRACE. IT'S AN ATTACHMENT ON THE WHOLE HOUSE. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT? I GOT TO TAKE ALL YOUR PERSONAL EFFECTS. HMM. YOU'LL HAVE ME STRIPPED LIKE MAHATMA GANDHI. YOU COULDN'T WAIT TILL TOMORROW, COULD YOU? YOU SEE, I CAN'T VERY WELL GO OUT AND TELL MY FRIENDS THAT THE WHOLE HOUSE HAS BEEN ATTACHED BECAUSE I OWE A FEW FRANCS HERE AND THERE, NOW CAN I? BUT IT'S HALF A MILLION, YOUR GRACE. MY DEAR FELLOW, IF I CAN'T PAY IT, WHAT DIFFERENCE DOES IT MAKE WHETHER IT'S HALF A FRANC OR 10 MILLION? BUT I CAN PAY YOU TOMORROW. HOW CAN WE TELL? WHY DON'T YOU STAY RIGHT HERE TILL I DO PAY YOU? MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME. COME DOWN AND MEET THE LADIES. OH, BUT WE'RE NOT DRESSED FOR THAT. OH, YOU LOOK CHARMING. BY THE WAY, WHO IS YOUR TAILOR? WHY DON'T YOU STAY HERE AND HAVE SOME SUPPER, ANYWAY? PLENTY TO EAT. PLENTY TO DRINK. I'LL GIVE YOU A ROOM TO SLEEP IN, AND IN THE MORNING, I'LL PAY YOU. HOW'S THAT? OH, HE HASN'T GOT HIS NIGHTGOWN. HMM. I'VE GOT IT. YOU CAN SLEEP IN YOUR UNDERCLOTHES. EXCUSE ME. HOW DO YOU DO? BEAUTIFUL PARTY, ISN'T IT? YES. CHARMING. THE DECORATIONS ARE BEAUTIFUL, AREN'T THEY? YES. EVERYTHING READY? I HAVE ALL THE DOORS AND WINDOWS GUARDED AND 4 OF OUR BEST MEN HERE AS GUESTS. SPLENDID. THANK YOU. STAY OUT OF HERE! HOW DO YOU DO? CLOSE THAT DOOR. CERTAINLY. WON'T YOU PLEASE GO? CERTAINLY. BUT FIRST LET ME ASK, HOW DO YOU LIKE MY BED? WELL, I DIDN'T MEAN TO, REALLY. I WAS COLD. OH. YES, IT IS A COLD NIGHT FOR MAY. HOWEVER, DON'T YOU THINK PARIS IS CHARMING IN THE SPRING? WELL, I PREFER RUSSIA. YOU SEE, I COME FROM THERE. REALLY? HOW DELIGHTFUL. I HAVE A PASSION FOR CAVIAR. WAS YOUR FATHER THE GENERAL- I PRESUME YOUR FATHER WAS A GENERAL. OF THE IMPERIAL ARMY. YES. WAS YOUR FATHER THE GENERAL FOND OF CAVIAR? HE ATE IT ON PANCAKES FOR BREAKFAST. DID HE? STAY FOR BREAKFAST. WE'LL HAVE CAVIAR. SIR, AREN'T YOU OVERSTEPPING THE BOUNDS OF CONVENTION? BUT, DEAR LADY, DIDN'T YOU LEAVE THOSE BEHIND WHEN YOU STEPPED INTO MY BED? OH, I ASSURE YOU, BEING HERE IS NO PLEASURE. OH, BUT THE NIGHT IS STILL YOUNG. OH, SIR! PARDON ME. I, UH, I THINK YOUR DRESS HAS SLIPPED. I HAVEN'T ANY ON. OH. IS THAT A LITTLE RUSSIAN CUSTOM? HMM? WHO ARE YOU? HMM? WAIT A MINUTE. LET ME GUESS. YOU'RE, UH... YOU'RE THE BEAUTIFUL WIFE OF THAT RED-NOSED OLD GRAND DUKE ALEXIS. HMM? NO? YOU'RE THE STAR OF THAT NEW RUSSIAN REVUE WHERE THEY SING ALL THOSE CHEERFUL LITTLE DITTIES ABOUT THE FAMINE AND THE SNOW AND THE WOLVES. I KNOW- YOU'RE HERE TO HELP THE POLICE FIND ARSENE LUPIN. HMM? OH, NO, OF COURSE. THAT'S ABSURD. I'VE GOT IT. THE DOCTOR BROUGHT YOU IN A LITTLE BLACK BAG... AND PUT YOU UNDER A ROSEBUSH, AND YOUR MOTHER FOUND YOU AND CALLED YOU... SONIA. SONIA? SONIA, WHAT ARE YOU DOING IN MY BED? I BROKE THE STRAP ON MY EVENING GOWN. IT'S BEING FIXED IN THE NEXT ROOM, AND I WAS COLD. AWW. POOR SONIA. EXCUSE ME JUST A MINUTE. I HATE DANCING WITH MEN WITH DAMP HANDS. THEY RUB ALL THE POWDER OFF YOUR BACK. DARLING, WOULD YOU PLEASE HURRY? YES, MADAM. WELL, HERE WE ARE. IT'S VERY NICE. IT'S A LITTLE NAUGHTY. IT'S VERY NI- YOU THINK YOUR FATHER THE GENERAL WOULD APPROVE OF THIS? MY FATHER THE GENERAL ALWAYS SAID THAT A GENTLEMAN WAS A MAN WHO NEVER WENT TO BED WITH HIS SPURS ON. ISN'T THAT A PITY? I'M SO FOND OF HORSES. I COULD GIVE UP RIDING, I SUPPOSE. GIVE ME THAT DRESS. YOU CAN'T GET INTO IT ALONE. THE MAID WILL HELP ME. THE MAI... I KNOW MORE ABOUT UNHOOKING THAN ANY MAID IN PARIS. YES, BUT I WANT THIS ONE HOOKED. I'M GOING TO STAY RIGHT HERE IN THIS BED UNTIL YOU LEAVE THIS ROOM. WHAT ARE YOU DOING? WELL, IF YOU'RE GOING TO STAY IN BED, YOU WON'T NEED THE DRESS. WAIT! IF YOU'LL... PUT OUT THE LIGHTS. I THOUGHT RUSSIA WAS A COLD COUNTRY. PLEASE. PLEASE. I THINK WE'D BETTER GO AND DANCE. LATER. WELL, NOW, REALLY. HA HA! COME ON. WE DANCE. WELL, IF YOU INSIST... BUT IT WON'T BE HALF AS MUCH FUN. THERE'S THAT FASCINATING GOURNEY-MARTIN. I MUST MEET HIM. REALLY? HOW PECULIAR OF YOU. HOWEVER... GASTON! JUST A MINUTE. COUNTESS SONIA... KRISHNOV. HMM. PERMIT ME TO PRESENT THE HONORABLE GOURNEY-MARTIN. I'M DELIGHTED. I'M VERY HAPPY. SHE THINKS YOU'RE CHARMING. REALLY? AREN'T YOU GOING TO ASK ME TO DANCE? CERTAINLY. CERTAINLY. I DON'T DANCE VERY WELL, BUT I'M WILLING TO TRY. CHARMING FELLOW, ISN'T HE? HE'S A GREAT FRIEND OF MINE. DO YOU KNOW HIM WELL? INTIMATELY, BUT INNOCENTLY. YOU KNOW, HE'S COMING DOWN TO MY COUNTRY PLACE AFTER THE PARTY. OH, I'M SORRY. WE'D PLANNED A LITTLE EXCURSION TOGETHER. THIS IS A SECRET, BUT I'VE BEEN THREATENED BY THIS ARSENE LUPIN, AND CHARMERACE INSISTS ON COMING DOWN TO PROTECT ME. SO MY LITTLE EXCURSION WILL HAVE TO BE PUT OFF. NOW, THAT WON'T DO AT ALL. WHAT WERE YOU AND CHARMERACE INTENDING TO DO? WE WANTED TO GO AWAY AND HAVE A NICE, LONG TALK. OH, I SEE. I SEE. WELL, THEN WHY DON'T YOU COME DOWN TO MY CHATEAU? AND IF YOU RUN OUT OF WORDS, I'VE GOT A DICTIONARY. YOU'RE SO UNDERSTANDING. PARDON ME. I'M CUTTING IN. SONIA, AFTER ALL I'VE DONE FOR YOU. BUT I THINK HE'S CHARMING. GOURNEY-MARTIN, CHARMING? MY DEAR CHILD, YOU'RE MAD. WHY, HE'S BEER. STALE, COMMON, HEAVY BEER. OH, AND YOU? YOU'RE CHAMPAGNE, I SUPPOSE. HMM. WITH THE HEADACHE THAT COMES AFTER. NOT AT ALL, SONIA. I'M A SPECIAL KIND OF CHAMPAGNE FULL OF SPARKLE, WARMTH, GAIETY, AND INTOXICATION, THE KIND OF CHAMPAGNE YOU CAN DRINK ANY HOUR OF THE DAY OR NIGHT- EVEN BEFORE BREAKFAST. REALLY? SHALL WE DANCE? SONIA, YOU'RE ALWAYS SO RESTLESS. POOR LITTLE THING. YOU CAN'T RELAX, EVEN IN BED, CAN YOU? ARSENE LUPIN! ARSENE LUPIN? 50,000 FRANCS REWARD. COME ON. ARSENE LUPIN, IN THE NAME OF THE LAW, I ARREST YOU! OH, YOU FOOLS. GET OUT! DON'T YOU SEE I'M BUSY? SO WE SEE. SO WE SEE. PUT UP YOUR HANDS. PUT UP YOUR HANDS. WHY, YOU IDIOT. PUT UP YOUR HANDS. I'LL KILL YOU. I MEAN IT. WHAT DO WE DO NOW? WHAT DO WE DO? GET THE DUKE. GET HELP. THERE'S ONE OF HIM. THERE'S ONLY TWO OF US. DON'T MOVE. I'LL SHOOT. QUIVERING JACKASS. I'VE BEEN LOOKING EVERYWHERE FOR YOU. OH? WHY? WHY? BECAUSE I WANTED TO CUT IN AGAIN. HOW SWEET OF YOU. I'M SORRY YOU DIDN'T FIND US. SO AM I. UH... WILL YOU PARDON ME A MOMENT? I'M AFRAID I'M NEGLECTING SOME OF MY GUESTS. WHAT'S THE MATTER? WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? WE'VE GOT HIM, YOUR GRACE. WE CAUGHT HIM! WHO DO YOU MEAN? ARSENE LUPIN. WHAT? WE CAUGHT HIM IN YOUR LIBRARY. YOU MEAN, YOU- THERE HE IS. OH, MY GOOD MAN, YOU'RE CRAZY. THESE- GET BACK THERE! WHAT ARE YOU DOING, YOU FOOL? THIS MAN'S GUERCHARD, OF THE POLICE. WHAT? THESE TWO FOOLS THINK I'M ARSENE LUPIN. THAT YOU'RE ARSENE LUPIN? WELL, OF COURSE, MAYBE YOU ARE, AND I'M THE QUEEN OF RUMANIA. I'M SORRY, GENTLEMEN, AT YOUR DISAPPOINTMENT, BUT THIS MAN REALLY IS GUERCHARD, ONE OF THE HEADS OF THE SECRET SERVICE. ARE YOU SURE? OF COURSE I'M SURE. THAT IS... OF COURSE HE'S GUERCHARD. BUT WE CAUGHT HIM ROBBING YOUR DESK. HUH? WELL, LOOK HERE. "WANTED DEAD OR ALIVE, ARSENE LUPIN. "50,000 FRANCS REWARD FOR THE CAPTURE OF THIS NOTORIOUS THIEF. "6 FEET TALL, WEIGHS 190 POUNDS. LIMP IN HIS RIGHT FOOT." WELL, THAT IS FUNNY, ISN'T IT? I SAY, HOW TALL ARE YOU, GUERCHARD? I'M 6 FEET, AND I WEIGH 190 POUNDS, AND I LIMP WITH MY RIGHT FOOT, BUT I'M NOT ARSENE LUPIN. OF COURSE YOU'RE NOT. HOW COULD YOU BE, A MAN IN YOUR POSITION? YOU'RE SURE YARE GUERCHARD, AREN'T YOU? YES, I AM! THE ONLY REASON I ASK IS THAT, YOU SEE, YOU DIDN'T BELIEVE ME WHEN I TOLD YOU WHO I WAS. YOU REMEMBER? IF IT HADN'T BEEN FOR MY FRIENDS THERE, I DON'T KNOW WHAT WOULD HAVE HAPPENED. DO YOU THINK FOR A MOMENT THAT I'M SOMEBODY THAT I SAY I'M NOT? OH, NO, OLD MAN. NOT REALLY. OF COURSE, BUT, UH... WELL, AFTER ALL, YOU DO ANSWER THIS DESCRIPTION. YOU WERE FOUND RIFLING MY DESK. HAVE YOU ANY, UH, CREDENTIALS? CREDENTIALS? YES. YOU KNOW, A LITTLE BADGE OR A LITTLE LETTER. YOU MEAN YOU WANT ME TO BE IDENTIFIED? WELL, WHY NOT? I HAD TO BE. I CAN SETTLE IT QUICK. I'LL TAKE HIM TO HEADQUARTERS. I'LL NOT HAVE IT! I'M ON DUTY HERE, AND THIS PLACE IS THREATENED, AND I'M GOING TO STAY HERE. AFTER ALL, THAT'S RIGHT. YOU SEE, IF HE REALLY IS GUERCHARD AND ARSENE LUPIN IS TRYING TO ROB THIS HOUSE, WE REALLY NEED HIM HERE, DON'T WE? I'VE GOT IT. I'LL TELEPHONE OVER TO THE CHIEF OF POLICE AND HAVE HIM COME RIGHT TO THE HOUSE. YOU'LL TAKE HIS WORD, WON'T YOU? WELL, I GUESS SO. ISN'T THAT FAIR? YOU MEAN, I'M TO BE KEPT A PRISONER IN THIS ROOM WITH THESE TWO FOOLS WHEN I REALLY OUGHT TO BE DOWNSTAIRS? ONLY TILL WE FIND OUT WHO YOU REALLY ARE. I'M GUERCHARD! MY DEAR SIR, IF YOU ARE, I'LL APOLOGIZE TO YOU AS CHARMINGLY AS YOU DID TO ME. YOU BETTER WATCH HIM, GENTLEMEN. AND BY THE WAY, IF HE ATTEMPTS TO ESCAPE, PERHAPS YOU'LL HAVE TO SHOOT. TO KILL? WELL, THE REWARD SAID DEAD OR ALIVE, DIDN'T IT? WILL YOU EXCUSE ME, OLD MAN? I'LL SEE YOU LATER. GET BACK THERE! HE SAID TO SHOOT. NO. NO, HE HAS NO CREDENTIALS OF ANY KIND. IT WOULD BE A GREAT FAVOR TO ME IF YOU COULD COME OVER HERE RIGHT WAY. JUST A MOMENT, PLEASE. DID YOU RING, SIR? HAVE THAT SURPRISE CAKE SERVED RIGHT AWAY. IN ABOUT A HALF-HOUR, SIR? IN HALF A MINUTE. HURRY UP. HELLO. 10 MINUTES? YOU CAN'T DO IT ANY SOONER THAN THAT, EH? WELL, THAT'S ALL RIGHT, OLD MAN, IF YOU CAN'T MAKE IT ANY SOONER. THANKS. THANKS VERY MUCH. JUST A MOMENT, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN. DON'T BE ALARMED! THE LIGHTS WILL BE ON AGAIN IN A MOMENT. AS YOU KNOW, THIS IS MY BIRTHDAY. I HAVE A LITTLE SURPRISE FOR YOU. OH! OH!

GET BACK THERE. GET BACK! OH, YOU IDIOTS! WHEN THE LIGHTS WENT OUT, SOMEBODY TOOK IT. TOOK WHAT? MY TIARA. SOMEBODY PULLED IT OFF MY HEAD IN THE DARK. MY NECKLACE! SOMEONE STOLE IT FROM ME WHILE THE LIGHTS WERE OFF. WHAT ARE THEY YELLING ABOUT? WHAT HAS HAPPENED? MY BRACELET. I'VE BEEN ROBBED! ROBBED? MY DEAR CHILD, THAT'S TERRIBLE. ARE YOU SURE YOU HAD IT ON? I'M POSITIVE. I CAN'T UNDERSTAND IT. DID YOU FEEL ANYBODY TAKE IT? WHY, NO. I WAS STANDING- WELL, NO ONE'S BEEN NEAR ME BUT YOU. KEEP YOUR PLACES, PLEASE! KEEP YOUR PLACES. NO ONE WILL BE PERMITTED TO LEAVE THIS FLOOR. WHAT DO YOU THINK YOU'RE DOING? WHO THE DEVIL ARE YOU? ORDERS FROM HEADQUARTERS, SIR. SEE THAT NO ONE GETS OUT OF THE WINDOWS. OH, YOU'VE HAD YOUR MEN HERE ALL EVENING? YES, SIR. MY DEAR FELLOW, THAT'S VERY INTELLIGENT OF YOU. I CONGRATULATE YOU. THANK YOU. NOT AT ALL. EMILE. I'M GLAD YOU'RE HERE. WHAT HAPPENED? THERE'S BEEN SOME SORT OF A ROBBERY, APPARENTLY. WE TURNED OUT THE LIGHTS TO SHOW MY BIRTHDAY CAKE- WHERE'S GUERCHARD? OH, THEN HE REALLY IS GUERCHARD? I DON'T UNDERSTAND YOUR GRACE. GUERCHARD WAS SENT HERE TO SEE THAT NO ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED. WHERE IS HE? WELL, HE'S UP IN THE LIBRARY PRESENTLY. GET GUERCHARD. THE REST OF YOU GUARD THE DOORS AND WINDOWS. YOU SEE, THERE WAS SOME SORT OF DOUBT ABOUT HIS IDENTITY, AS I TELEPHONED YOU BEFORE, AND WE DETAINED HIM UPSTAIRS. HMM. I SEE. AND WHILE HE WAS DETAINED, A ROBBERY WAS COMMITTED? SO IT SEEMS. YOU'LL PARDON ME, YOUR GRACE. DID YOU SEE ANYTHING? DID YOU FIND OUT WHO IT WAS? NO, SIR. THE LIGHTS WENT OUT. I COULDN'T SEE A THING. OH, YOU BLIND FOOL! YOU COULDN'T SEE ANYTHING IF THE LIGHTS HAD STAYED ON. I'LL TAKE CHARGE OF THIS. VERY WELL. LADIES AND GENTLEMEN, I REGRET TO INFORM YOU THAT IT WILL BE NECESSARY FOR YOU ALL TO SUBMIT TO A SEARCH. THE GENTLEMEN WILL REMAIN IN THE BALLROOM, AND THE LADIES WILL GO UPSTAIRS. THE POLICE MATRONS ARE ON THE WAY NOW. MY DEAR GUERCHARD, I CAN'T APOLOGIZE SUFFICIENTLY. NOT NECESSARY AT ALL. NOT NECESSARY, YOUR GRACE. NOW IF YOU WILL KINDLY TAKE YOUR PLACE WITH THE OTHER MEN TO BE SEARCHED. WHAT? JUST AS A MATTER OF FORM. I HOPE THEY'LL BE GENTLE. I'M AWFULLY TICKLISH. WELL? PERFECT. HE FOUND ME IN HIS BED. I KNOW. IT WAS MY OWN IDEA. YOU TOLD ME TO GAIN HIS CONFIDENCE. SO DID YOU? I WAS VERY CHARMING. MM-HMM. WHAT ELSE DID YOU DO? I DID ENOUGH. I DON'T DOUBT THAT, BUT WHAT DID YOU FIND OUT? CHARMERACE LEAVES WITH GOURNEY-MARTIN FOR THE COUNTRY TONIGHT, AND I'M GOING WITH THEM. OH, SPLENDID. SPLENDID. NOW KEEP YOUR WITS ABOUT YOU AND WATCH CHARMERACE. YES. AND YOU? OH, I'LL LIMP A LITTLE AND SLOUCH A LITTLE AND LOOK MORE STUPID THAN EVER. I'M DOING VERY WELL. GO ON UPSTAIRS AND GET SEARCHED. I TELL YOU, I'VE SEARCHED EVERYTHING AND EVERYBODY. EVEN THE DOORS WERE LOCKED, BUT IN SPITE OF THAT, HE GOT AWAY AGAIN. OH, DARLING, I'M SO SORRY, BUT, FATHER, I KNOW YOU'LL CATCH HIM. NOBODY'S AS SMART AS YOU ARE. I KNOW I'M SMART, AND YOU KNOW I'M SMART, BUT ARSENE LUPIN, DOES HE KNOW IT? OH, COME ON NOW. LET'S GET OUR HEADS TOGETHER. MAYBE WE CAN THINK OF A WAY TO TRAP HIM. OH, I'VE GOT A PLAN, ALL RIGHT. OH, I KNEW IT. IT PROBABLY WON'T WORK. I BET IT WILL. WELL, ANYHOW, GIVE THE OLD MAN A KISS. WE'LL HAVE TO STOP AND GET MY THINGS. HOTEL D'ARBY ON RUE ST-ROCH. YES, SIR. BUT, YOUR GRACE... UH... I'M TERRIBLY SORRY. I'M AFRAID I CAN'T GO WITH YOU NOW. THERE ARE A COUPLE OF DISTINGUISHED GUESTS I'VE FORGOTTEN. BUT HOW ABOUT ARSENE LUPIN? THAT'S ALL RIGHT. I'LL TAKE THE ROADSTER AND BE DOWN IN A COUPLE OF HOURS. I'M SURE I'LL BE THERE BEFORE HE WILL. GOOD NIGHT. SEE YOU TOMORROW. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. I'M AWFULLY SORRY. I FORGOT ALL ABOUT YOU FELLOWS. NOW, LISTEN. I'VE GOT TO BE AWAY FOR 4 OR 5 DAYS- MAYBE ONLY TWO DAYS- THEN I'LL COME BACK AND PAY YOU EVERYTHING I OWE YOU. MEANWHILE, YOU CAN HAVE THE RUN OF THE HOUSE. PLENTY TO EAT, PLENTY TO DRINK, AND LOTS OF SLEEP. AND I'LL GIVE YOU A COUPLE OF GOOD TELEPHONE NUMBERS. TELEPHONE NUMBERS? HELLO. IS THIS MONSIEUR GUERCHARD OF THE POLICE? IT IS ALEXIS PETROVICH, SONIA'S COUSIN. HUH? YOU KNOW, SONIA, WHO WORK FOR YOU. SHE WANTED ME TO TELL YOU SHE JUST LEFT FOR THE COUNTRY WITH GOURNEY-MARTIN IN HIS CAR. HUH? OH, CHARMERACE. OH. HA HA! THE SILLY ASS. HE'S GOING TO FOLLOW HER DOWN THERE. YES. HA HA HA! IT'S WORKING. WHAT IS? A TRAP. I SET A TRAP AND BAITED IT WITH A PIECE OF CHEESE. CHEESE?

YOU SEE, I HAVE A LOT OF BONDS IN THERE, AND I WAS A BIT NERVOUS- BONDS THEY SAY I GOT ILLEGALLY, BUT NEVERTHELESS, YOU KNOW, I WANT TO KEEP THEM. I DON'T BLAME YOU. THAT'S A FUNNY-LOOKING SAFE YOU'VE GOT THERE. IT, UH, HAS NO COMBINATION. NO, IT HASN'T. OPEN IT. WHAT? GO ON. OPEN IT. OH, ALL RIGHT. OW! HA HA HA! THAT'S THE ELECTRIC CURRENT. TRY TO GET AWAY. DAMN IT, I CAN'T. THIS IS A GREAT IDEA. I CONGRATULATE YOU. OW! THAT HURTS! DOESN'T IT? YES. CAN'T YOU GET YOUR HAND AWAY? NO, I CAN'T. WAIT TILL I TURN OFF THE SWITCH. HA HA HA! WELL...

THAT'S ALL RIGHT, OLD MAN. I THINK IT'S ALL RATHER FUN. FUN? WELL, I'M GLAD YOU'RE ENJOYING IT. MY DEAR FELLOW, I WAS NOT ONLY AMUSED, BUT INSTRUCTED. WOULD YOU HAVE A DRINK BEFORE YOU GO TO BED? NO, THANKS, OLD MAN. WELL, GOOD NIGHT. SEE YOU AT BREAKFAST. GOOD NIGHT. GOOD NIGHT. SONIA- ASLEEP AND HELPLESS. NOT THAT WAY, DARLING. THIS WAY. WHOA. I MUSTN'T FRIGHTEN HER. I'LL WAKE HER VERY GENTLY. SHE'S NOT ASLEEP. SHE'S DEAD. IT BEATS. I THINK IT BEATS. DARLING... I HATE TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF YOU IN YOUR HELPLESS CONDITION, BUT, YOU KNOW, THERE'S ONE THING THAT'S NEVER FAILED YET, SOMETHING THAT'LL MAKE THE BLOOD RUN THROUGH YOUR VEINS AND LITTLE SHIVERS GO UP AND DOWN YOUR SPINE. IF YOU SLEEP THROUGH WHAT I'M GOING TO DO TO YOU, YOU'RE NOT THE WOMAN I THINK YOU ARE. OH! BUT, GUERCHARD, ARSENE LUPIN MUST BE HERE. WHEN I WOKE UP THIS MORNING, THERE WAS THIS BEAUTIFUL DIAMOND BRACELET IN MY ROOM AND THIS NOTE- EXCUSE ME. "MY DEAR COUNTESS, "LOVELY LADIES SHOULDN'T WEAR FALSE JEWELRY. "I TOOK FROM YOU LAST NIGHT WITH SOMETHING MORE WORTHY OF YOUR BEAUTY." AND IT'S SIGNED "ARSENE LUPIN." IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO? KEEP YOUR EYES OPEN AND KEEP IN TOUCH WITH ME HERE. ALL RIGHT. I WILL. WELL, WHAT DO YOU THINK OF MY ANCESTORS? HMM. ARE THESE ALL YOUR ANCESTORS? WELL, I BOUGHT THEM. THAT MAKES THEM MINE, DOESN'T IT? THAT'S ONE WAY OF GETTING THEM. THAT'S WHERE IT HUNG. WHY HAVEN'T YOU COVERED THAT UP? YOU KNOW, THE PAINTING THAT HUNG THERE WAS THE MOST VALUABLE PAINTING IN FRANCE, WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE MONA LISA. I LEFT THE NAME THERE TO REMIND ME. YOU KNOW, THAT FELLOW WROTE TO ME AND TOLD ME TO SHIP IT TO HIM, AND WHEN I DIDN'T, IT DISAPPEARED. HUH. THAT'S EXTRAORDINARY, ISN'T IT? I WAS STANDING RIGHT HERE LOOKING AT THAT PAINTING WHEN MY BUTLER HANDED ME A LETTER. UH, PARDON ME, SIR, BUT THE MESSENGER SAID THIS WAS IMPORTANT. STRANGE. THAT'S THE SAME PECULIAR TYPE OF ENVELOPE. HERE. YOU READ IT FOR ME, WILL YOU, PLEASE? I HAVEN'T MY GLASSES. WELL? WHAT'S IT ABOUT? IT ISN'T VERY POLITE. NEVER MIND THE POLITENESS. WHAT DOES HE SAY? "GOURNEY-MARTIN, "YOU MADE MILLIONS IN WAR PROFITS WHEN MEN WERE DYING. YOU'VE STOLEN FROM WIDOWS AND ORPHANS." OH, YOU COULDN'T HAVE DONE THAT. OF COURSE NOT. WHAT ELSE DOES HE SAY? "YOU'VE HAD ALL THIS MONEY LONG ENOUGH. "I'M GOING TO TAKE YOUR JEWELS AND YOUR PAINTINGS. "I'LL CALL FOR THEM AT MIDNIGHT. "PLEASE HAVE THEM PACKED. ARSENE LUPIN." HAVE THEM PACKED? HE'S GOING TO ROB ME AGAIN? YOU KNOW, I WOULDN'T TAKE THIS TOO LIGHTLY IF I WERE YOU. WHY DON'T YOU SEND FOR THE LOCAL POLICE? WE HAVE NO LOCAL POLICE. I'LL SEND FOR GUERCHARD. THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO. THAT'S A GOOD IDEA. TELL HIM TO SEND AN OFFICER AND 4 OR 5 MEN. YOU'LL WANT THE HOUSE, UH, PRACTICALLY SURROUNDED. IT'S GOOD OF YOU TO TAKE SUCH AN INTEREST IN THIS. WELL, MY DEAR CHILD, WE'RE ALL INTERESTED. PERSONALLY, I CAN'T THINK OF ANYTHING MORE AMUSING THAN CATCHING ARSENE LUPIN. WOULDN'T YOU LIKE TO CATCH HIM? YES. I THINK SO. YES, I WOULD. WELL, CAN'T YOU MAKE UP YOUR MIND? WELL, I- GESUNDHEIT. 12:00. MAYBE HE'S NOT COMING. I WOULDN'T BE TOO SURE OF THAT. I'VE ALWAYS HEARD ARSENE LUPIN KEPT HIS APPOINTMENTS. WHO SHALL I SAY WANTS TO SEE HIM? NEVER MIND. I'LL GO RIGHT IN. GOOD EVENING. I'M SORRY TO BE LATE. WELL, GUERCHARD, YOU SCARED US TO DEATH. WE THOUGHT YOU WERE ARSENE LUPIN. YOU'RE NOT, ARE YOU?

AREN'T YOU GOING TO STAY? NO, NO. NO NEED FOR IT AT ALL. MY MEN ARE ALL HERE. DO YOU, UH, WANT TO GO BACK TO YOUR SOLITAIRE, OR WOULD YOU PREFER SOMETHING THAT REQUIRES TWO PEOPLE? LET ME HAVE THE KEY OF THE FRONT DOOR, WILL YOU, PLEASE? WHAT FOR? DON'T QUESTION MY MOTIVES. JUST LET ME HAVE IT, PLEASE. THAT'S IT. NO ONE. I- I UNDERSTAND. CHARMERACE- ASLEEP AND HELPLESS. HE'S NOT ASLEEP. HE'S DEAD. POOR MAN. SOMETHING MUST BE DONE ABOUT THIS. THERE'S ONE THING THAT HAS NEVER FAILED. NEVER MIND THAT. IDIOT, WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE? SHH. Just a minute. What have you got? Loot. What? Why not? YOU DON'T EXPECT ME TO HIDE IT FOR YOU? WELL, NOT ALONE. WE'LL DO IT TOGETHER. I'VE BEEN ROBBING THE ICEBOX. I'M STARVING TO DEATH, AREN'T YOU? FAMISHED.

OH, I'D LOVE TO MEET HIM, BUT, YOU KNOW, I THINK I'D BE A LITTLE AFRAID. WHY? WELL, AFRAID THAT I MIGHT NOT BE ABLE TO RESIST HIM. WHAT MAKES YOU FEEL THAT WAY ABOUT IT? WELL, THERE'S-THERE'S SOMETHING EXCITING ABOUT ARSENE LUPIN, BUT OF COURSE A MAN LIKE YOU WOULDN'T UNDERSTAND THAT. OH, I DON'T KNOW. I THINK I COULD HAVE AN OPEN MIND ABOUT THAT. HE'S A PECULIAR CHARACTER. I SUPPOSE HE'D STEAL FROM ANYBODY. POSSIBLY. BUT I DON'T THINK HE'D EVER TAKE ANYTHING FROM A WOMAN THAT SHE WASN'T WILLING TO GIVE. NO. I THINK YOU'RE PROBABLY RIGHT ABOUT THAT. HMM. GOOD NIGHT, SONIA. YOU'RE GOING? GOOD NIGHT. WAIT. WHERE ARE YOU GOING? I'M GOING TO BED. WHERE DOES ONE USUALLY GO AT THIS TIME OF NIGHT? ARE-ARE YOU QUITE SURE YOU'RE GOING TO BED? WHY, OF COURSE. WHAT'S ON YOUR MIND? WHAT ARE YOU SHAKING ABOUT? I'M AFRAID FOR YOU. WELL, WHAT COULD HAPPEN TO ME? I'M AFRAID YOU MIGHT GO DOWNSTAIRS AND THEY'D MISTAKE YOU FOR ARSENE LUPIN. OH. SONIA, YOU'RE A DARLING. WHAT MAKES YOU THINK THERE ISN'T MORE DANGER HERE THAN ANYWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD? HERE? WHAT DO YOU MEAN? YOU KNOW, EVERYTHING ABOUT YOU IS A LITTLE BIT DANGEROUS, SONIA. I RECOGNIZED THAT THE FIRST TIME I SAW YOU, BUT I COULDN'T DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT AT ALL. I TRIED TO, BUT I COULDN'T. WHAT-WHAT POSSIBLE DANGER COULD YOU BE IN WITH ME? YOUR EYES, FOR INSTANCE. ARE YOU AFRAID THEY MIGHT SEE TOO MUCH? WE COULD CLOSE THEM, PERHAPS. AND YOUR MOUTH. ARE YOU AFRAID IT MIGHT TELL TOO MUCH? NO... BUT IT'S DANGEROUS. I WONDER IF ARSENE LUPIN WOULD BE AFRAID. YOU KNOW, I NEVER HEARD HE WAS A COWARD. HELP! HELP! POLICE! HELP! HELP! POLICE! WHERE ARE THOSE POLICE? LOOK! I'VE BEEN ROBBED! LOOK! THEY'VE TAKEN ALL THE GOOD ONES AND LEFT THE FAKES! WHERE WERE YOU? WHERE WERE THE POLICE? WE'LL FIND OUT. POLICE! POLICE!

WELL, OF COURSE IT COULDN'T HAPPEN. OF COURSE IT COULDN'T. THE SAFE OPENED ITSELF, AND ALL MY BONDS AND MY JEWELS JUST BLEW AWAY! STOP YELLING THAT WAY. HOW LONG HAVE YOU HAD THIS TRICK SAFE? ABOUT A MONTH. ANYBODY KNOW HOW TO OPEN IT? NO. NOBODY. JUST I, MYSELF. OH, WAIT A MINUTE. CHARMERACE. CHARMERACE? YEAH. HE SAW ME SWITCH OFF THE CURRENT AND OPEN THE SAFE. ODILLE! YES, SIR.

NOW LOOK HERE. SUPPOSE I HELP YOU OUT OF THIS MESS, GIVE YOU SOME MONEY AND SEND YOU TO AMERICA, WHERE THE STREETS ARE PAVED WITH GOLD AND EVERYBODY'S RICH AND HAPPY AND PROSPEROUS. HUH? NOW, I-I'LL DO THIS FOR YOU, AND ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS TO TELL ME WHO PAID YOU TO COME DOWN HERE. I COULDN'T, SIR. I'M AFRAID. THERE'S NO NEED FOR THAT. I'M GUERCHARD. I'M THE POLICE. I'M FRANCE. I'LL PROTECT YOU. BRAVO! THAT'S A BEAUTIFUL SPEECH! MAGNIFICENT! HA HA HA! NOW LOOK HERE. I'LL LET YOU GO, AND I'LL GIVE YOU 50,000 FRANCS IF YOU'LL TELL ME WHAT YOU KNOW ABOUT THIS MAN. IS THIS ARSENE LUPIN? GO AHEAD, YOUNG MAN. TELL THIS NICE, KIND GENTLEMAN WHAT HE WANTS TO KNOW. I NEVER SAW HIM BEFORE IN MY LIFE. YOU DIDN'T REALLY THINK I WAS ARSENE LUPIN, DID YOU, OLD MAN? NOW LOOK HERE, YOU MEN. I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A CHANCE. THERE'S FREEDOM FOR ANY MAN THAT TELLS THE TRUTH- FREEDOM AND A CLEAN SLATE. WELL, HAVE YOU GOT A TONGUE? DO YOU KNOW HIM? NO, SIR. YOU KNOW HIM? NO, SIR. YOU KNOW, GUERCHARD, I THINK I'D KEEP AN EYE ON THESE FELLOWS. I'M QUITE SURE ARSENE LUPIN WOULD NEVER LET SUCH LOYALTY GO UNREWARDED. I'LL BET YOU ANYTHING YOU LIKE HE GETS THEM OFF. AH, ENOUGH OF THIS. UH, WILL YOU GO IN THE LIBRARY, YOUR GRACE? TAKE THESE MEN BACK TO PARIS. WE'LL FIND A WAY OF MAKING THEM TALK. YOU KNOW, GUERCHARD, I DON'T UNDERSTAND ONE THING, AND THAT'S YOUR FIXED IDEA THAT I'M ARSENE LUPIN. REALLY, YOUR GRACE, YOU MUST FORGIVE ME. I'M VERY SORRY, BUT AS A MATTER OF FACT, I'M QUITE UPSET. UNDER MY VERY NOSE, SO TO SPEAK, THE SAFE WAS ROBBED. OH, I CAN'T BELIEVE IT. WELL, IT'S TRUE JUST THE SAME. HERE, YOU CAN SEE FOR YOURSELF. AAH! WAIT A MINUTE. WAIT A MINUTE. THERE. SO YOU DID KNOW HOW TO OPEN IT. WHY, YES, OF COURSE I KNEW HOW TO OPEN IT. I WAS CAUGHT THE SAME WAY MYSELF. GOURNEY-MARTIN SHOWED ME HOW TO GET FREE. OUTSIDE OF GOURNEY-MARTIN, YOU'RE THE ONLY MAN IN THE WORLD THAT KNOWS HOW TO OPEN THAT SAFE. HMM. WHERE WERE YOU WHEN IT WAS ROBBED? I DON'T KNOW. WHEN WAS IT ROBBED? LAST THAN HALF AN HOUR AGO. OH. LET ME SEE. WHERE THE DEV- OH, I REMEMBER. I REMEMBER WHERE I WAS. I WAS RIDING A PINK OCTOPUS IN A BAD HAILSTORM. WHAT? IN MY DREAMS. I WAS ASLEEP AND DREAMING. OH, THEN YOU WERE IN BED ALL NIGHT. I WAS. YOU HAVE NO WAY OF PROVING THAT, HAVE YOU? NO, MY DEAR SIR. I'M A BACHELOR. WELL, NOW WE'LL FIND OUT THE TRUTH. SONIA, WERE YOU ON DUTY LAST NIGHT AS PER INSTRUCTIONS? YES. IS SHE A POLICE AGENT? SHE CERTAINLY IS. NOW, YOU HEARD HIS GRACE SAY THAT HE SPENT THE NIGHT IN HIS OWN ROOM. IS THAT THE TRUTH? NO. NO, I DIDN'T THINK IT WAS. NOW, TELL US EXACTLY WHERE HE DID SPEND THE NIGHT. HE SPENT IT WITH ME. WITH YOU? YOU TOLD ME TO WATCH HIM. YES, I KNOW. HE CAME TO MY ROOM LAST NIGHT WITH CHAMPAGNE AND SUPPER. HOW LONG DID HE STAY? ALL NIGHT. EATING ALL THE TIME? OH, NO-TALKING. WE TALKED TILL MORNING, AND THEN I HEARD SOMEONE SCREAMING THAT HE'D BEEN ROBBED, AND WE RAN OUT INTO THE HALL. AND WHERE DID HE GO? I SAW HIM GO INTO HIS OWN ROOM, AND I STOOD THERE IN THE HALL FOR A FEW MINUTES UNTIL A POLICEMAN CAME UP THE STAIRS, AND THEN I WENT INTO MY OWN ROOM, AND THE MAN KNOCKED AT HIS DOOR. I SEE. YOU'RE IN LOVE WITH HIM. YOU TAKE MY PAY, MY PROMISES OF FREEDOM, BUT YOU'RE LIKE ALL CROOKS. YOU CAN'T PLAY SQUARE. YOU'RE LIKE ALL THE REST OF THEM. YOU'VE FALLEN FOR HIM. JUST BECAUSE I WOULDN'T LIE ABOUT HIM? OH, SONIA, WHY ARE YOU SO EASY? YOUR FREEDOM FOR A FEW CHEAP KISSES. WHY, HE'LL PASS YOU UP- WELL, THAT CONCERNS ME! NOW, JUST A MINUTE, GUERCHARD. THAT CONCERNS ME, TOO, A LITTLE. YOU SEE, THE COUNTESS KRISHNOV AND MYSELF- COUNTESS KRISHNOV? HA HA HA! SAY, THAT'S A GOOD ONE. SHE'S SOPHIE KRELBERG, A SWINDLER- A CONVICTED SWINDLER. A SWINDLER? CONVICTED? EXACTLY. I THOUGHT THAT WOULD GET YOU. YOU MEAN SHE'S BEEN IN PRISON? YEAH. WHAT HAVE YOU GOT TO SAY TO THAT? NOTHING MUCH... EXCEPT I THINK SHE'S QUITE THE MOST ADORABLE SWINDLER... I'VE EVER MET. 2 1/2 YEARS IN A STONE CELL WON'T HELP HER LOOKS ANY. 21/2 YEARS? YEAH, EXACTLY. SHE'S OUT ON PAROLE TO DO THIS LITTLE JOB FOR ME, AND IF SHE FAILS, BACK SHE GOES. WELL, SONIA, I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU ANOTHER CHANCE. WHERE WAS THIS MAN LAST NIGHT? WITH ME. OH, I'LL STOP THIS LYING. ODILLE! YES, SIR? TAKE THIS WOMAN BACK TO PRISON. YES, SIR.

YOU KNOW SHE'S LYING TO PROTECT ME, DON'T YOU? HA HA! OF COURSE SHE'S LYING, BUT SWILL TELL THE TRUTH, AND WHEN SHE DOES, YOU'LL BE ON YOUR WAY TO PRISON, MR. ARSENE LUPIN. WHAT'S THAT? "GUERCHARD-UNLESS MY MEN ARE RELEASED BY NOON TOMORROW, "YOU'LL BE DISGRACED FOREVER. "UNDER YOUR NOSE, I'LL STEAL THE MONA LISA OUT OF THE LOUVRE." AND IT'S SIGNED "ARSENE LUPIN."

THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY LUPIN COULD HAVE GOT TO LOOK SO MUCH LIKE YOU, AND THAT'S WITH YOUR HELP. NOW, WHERE IS HE? I- I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT. IF YOU WON'T TALK, YOUR HORSE WILL. DROP THOSE REINS. GIVE HIM HIS HEAD. I WAS SENT TO BRING YOU WITH ME RIGHT AWAY, MISS. YOUR FATHER'S BEEN HURT. HURT? IS HE BADLY HURT?

THAT MEANS SONIA GOES FREE, IS THAT RIGHT? YES. SHE'S DONE HER JOB. NOW, LISTEN, GUERCHARD, I'M THE ONLY PERSON IN THE WORLD THAT KNOWS WHERE THAT PICTURE IS. NOW, LET'S DO BUSINESS. I'LL TRADE YOU FOR THE PICTURE FIRST, AND I'LL TRADE YOU FOR MY FREEDOM AFTER THAT. I WON'T TRADE WITH YOU. I WON'T DEAL WITH YOU.

ALL RIGHT, EXPLAIN TO THE PEOPLE OF FRANCE JUST HOW YOU LET THAT PICTURE SLIP THROUGH YOUR FINGERS. THEN YOU TELL THEM WHERE IT IS. HOW MUCH DO YOU WANT? HOW MUCH MONEY HAVE I GOT TO GIVE YOU?

THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT YOUR DAUGHTER, GUERCHARD. MY DAUGHTER'S AT HOME. YOUR DAUGHTER'S BEEN KIDNAPPED. SHE'S OUT OF THE COUNTRY ACROSS THE BORDER.

NOW, IT'S PERFECTLY SIMPLE FOR YOU TO BLOW THAT WHISTLE. THIS WHOLE HOUSE IS SURROUNDED BY YOUR MEN. BUT IF YOU DO, IT MIGHT MAKE MY MEN TOO ANGRY TO CARE WHAT HAPPENED TO YOUR DAUGHTER. BUT YOU CAN BUY HER BACK. THINK WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN TO HER WHERE SHE'S GOING. YOU'D DO THAT TO AN INNOCENT CHILD? IF YOU SEND ME TO PRISON. SHE'S GOT EVERYTHING IN THE WORLD TO LIVE FOR. CHARMERACE, YOU CAN'T DO THAT. I'M FIGHTING FOR MY LIFE! I'LL USE ANY WEAPON I CAN LAY MY HAND ON. PLAY FAIR, CHARMERACE. I HAVE. SO HAVE YOU UP TO NOW, BUT THIS- THE DUKE OF CHARMERACE DESCENDING TO A BARGAIN LIKE THIS. THEN SET ME FREE. I'LL HELP YOU. I'LL ASK CLEMENCY FOR YOU. I'LL DO EVERYTHING I CAN FOR YOU, BUT SET YOU FREE? I CAN'T DO THAT. YOU KNOW I CAN'T DO THAT! GIVE HER BACK TO ME, CHARMERACE. SHE'S ALL I'VE GOT IN THE WORLD. WHY, I-I'VE TAKEN CARE OF HER EVER SINCE SHE WAS A BABY. I'VE DONE EVERYTHING FOR HER. I TAUGHT HER TO WALK. I... I WANTED HER TO WALK STRAIGHT AND BE HAPPY. GIVE HER BACK TO ME. THEN TAKE THESE OFF. ALL RIGHT. SONIA, GIVE ME THE KEY. I WON'T DO IT. CHARMERACE, I WON'T DO IT! IT'S MY JOB. I'M NO CROOK! I'M ON THE LEVEL. I WON'T DO IT. NOT EVEN FOR YOUR DAUGHTER? NOT FOR ANYBODY IN THE WORLD. I'VE GOT A JOB TO DO, AND I'M GOING TO DO IT. YOU KNOW, THERE OUGHT TO BE A LAW AGAINST FOOLS LIKE YOU. YOU MAKE FOOLS LIKE ME A LITTLE ASHAMED. HA HA HA! ALL RIGHT... SEND HER IN. DAD, ARE YOU ALL RIGHT? WELL, IT ALMOST WORKED. OH, I KNEW IT. YOU'RE A MUCH BETTER THIEF THAN YOU ARE A LIAR. I THOUGHT I WAS GOING PRETTY GOOD. I'M SORRY, CHARMERACE. I'VE GOT TO TAKE YOU WITH ME. I KNOW. AS FOR YOU, SOPHIE, THERE'S A FRENCH LINER LEAVING AT NOON TOMORROW FOR AMERICA. TAKE IT. COME ON, CHARMERACE. YOU KNOW, I'M AWFULLY LUCKY. IF THEY'D CAUGHT ME JUST ONE WEEK AGO... I'D NEVER HAVE KNOWN YOU. COME ON. CAN'T YOU SMILE AT A GUY? SO WHAT DID YOU DO WITH GOURNEY-MARTIN'S JEWELS? I HID THEM IN THE MATTRESS OF HIS OWN BED. SO WHERE DID YOU GET MY SHOES? YOU REMEMBER THAT OLD CLOTHES DEALER CAME TO YOUR HOUSE A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO? THAT WAS ME. YOU DON'T LIMP. I DO IN YOUR SHOES. HUH? I LOST A MAN AT THAT BRIDGE ONCE. HE DIVED OVER WITH HIS HANDCUFFS ON AND GOT AWAY. WHAT DID YOU DO? OH, I JUMPED OUT OF THE CAR AND FIRED 5 SHOTS AT HIM, BUT I MISSED HIM. I'M A BAD SHOT. CAN YOU SWIM? AND HOW. THAT LAST SHOT GOT HIM, SIR. YEAH. I FIRED 4 SHOTS AT HIM. HE SCREAMED AND FELL IN THE WATER. THAT'S THE END OF HIM. THAT'S FINE, GUERCHARD. YOU'LL BE A PUBLIC HERO. IT'S A GOOD TIME TO QUIT. MY RESIGNATION. I FEEL THAT I'VE FAILED. BUT HOW? HERE IS TMONA LISA. LUPIN IS DEAD. I KNOW, BUT I PROMISED TO BRING HIM TO JUSTICE, AND I DIDN'T. GUERCHARD, YOU CAN HAVE ANYTHING IN THE DEPARTMENT YOU LIKE. I'D LIKE A REST. I'D LIKE TO STAY HOME WITH MY DAUGHTER. I'M A LITTLE TIRED. THIS IS VERY LOVELY. IT IS NICE. BEAUTIFUL. MAY I SHOW YOU SOMETHING? NO, THANKS. I'LL PICK OUT WHAT I WANT. AHEM. YOU, UH... HAVEN'T ANY SOLID GOLD HANDCUFFS, HAVE YOU? GOLD HANDCUFFS? WELL, THAT'S NEAR ENOUGH. WE'LL TAKE IT. WOULDN'T OLD GUERCHARD LOVE TO SEE ME BUYIJEWELRY?
