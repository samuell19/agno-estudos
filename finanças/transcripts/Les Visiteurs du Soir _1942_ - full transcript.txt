THE DEVIL'S ENVOYS and so, in the lovely month of May, 1485, the Devil sent two of his envoys to this world to drive humans to despair There it is Tell me, my good man Would the lord of this castle welcome two minstrels who've traveled far to entertain him? - I believe so You're in luck Baron Hugues loves music and soon Miss Anne will be wed to Sir Renaud Since the engagement, it's been banquet after banquet In festive times, my skills aren't needed, so I fish to pass the time Thank you, good man No, let me thank you for calling me "good man"! In spite of everything, it's nice to hear! Come to me, pretty frogs! Make up your minds! Afraid of the executioner? Then come to the "good man"! My lords! Kind lords! How heavy is my heart! A beast who never hurt anyone, a beast who made the whole castle laugh! He was just crossing the courtyard and the guards shot him, just for sport This is all I have left! He's dead, kind lords He was my brother! What will I do? Woe is me! - Why bother, Gilles? - I enjoy doing good sometimes Why bother? These performers are putting me to sleep Let's hope this one is more entertaining You're hard to please I found the juggler quite amusing He has a sad face Father, isn't his face sad? - Shall I throw him out? - I don't wish to cause him harm It'd be a shame to lose such a face I agree! His hollow cheeks make me hungry! Stand up Show us what you can do Nothing myself, noble lord, but I can display three extremely rare creatures Few have ever seen them Commoners are naive and easily frightened Only the great can properly appreciate these oddities of nature You're too sensitive, Anne Take a look I assure you, they're very funny I don't want to Look, just to make me happy Then look back at me You'll only love me more I don't want to see them I feel sorry for them Take them away I don't want you to be sad, dear child These banquets are to make you happy Think you're pretty enough to mock them? I'm no beauty, but compared to them, I must seem pretty! I believe my daughter would like to hear sweet things that touch the heart Stories of romance, the yearnings of simple hearts Are there any singers in the hall? Demons and marvels Winds and waves Far away already The tide has gone out And you Like seaweed Caressed by the wind In the dunes of your bed You stir in your sleep Demons and marvels Winds and waves Far away already The tide has gone out But in your half-open eyes Two little waves Still remain Demons and marvels Winds and waves Two little waves To drown myself in You sing well, young man Who are you? My name is Gilles This is my brother, Dominique Sing us another song The tender and dangerous face of love Appeared to me one night after an endless day Perhaps it was an archer with his bow Perhaps a musician with his harp I know no more I know nothing All I know Is that he wounded me Perhaps with an arrow Perhaps with a song All I know Is that he wounded me His shot hit my heart wounded forever Burning Ardently burning This wound of love Love, always love! With its little sighs and big deceits! Before, at least we had songs about war, hunting, the urge to fight, to kill You're too harsh, Renaud I might not have loved Baroness Berthe like in the songs, but she meant so much to me So much But my wife is dead and times have changed Now everyone speaks of love Too much! I don't like it You look proud of yourself How dare you gaze into a lady's eyes while crooning such nonsense? Renaud, please! If I had you hung, would you sing as sweetly with a rope around your throat? I doubt it Then sing no more if you value the pitiful thing you call your life! Your mind is elsewhere, Anne Are you sad because of how I spoke of love? No, dear friend I'm not angry with you You know, I also used to dance when Berthe was still alive My creatures are tired Where may they sleep? I'll show you the room reserved for the performers - What are you thinking of? - Nothing Then who are you thinking of? Did I ever give you reason for jealousy? Fortunately, no I simply wish to remind you that soon you will be mine Did you hear me? - Yes, Renaud Your every pleasure, desire, even sorrow, if you have any, should be given to me May I at least dream? As little as possible! Dreams are dangerous and useless I never dream myself As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far I thanked Heaven for leading me to you As soon as I saw you, I knew you'd come for me I knew it I'm sure my life will change Do you regret it? No Will you regret it? Never Even if it makes me suffer Those who love never suffer Look at them Do they suffer? No They feel marvelously alone, the moonlight shines on their love And those two star-gazers, what are they thinking of? Nothing Not even the stars They are together, in love They are happy And that solitary man So sad, so hopeless Surely his beloved has left him, or he her, and so the moon, the stars, the birds, the very trees of this garden no longer exist for him He hears nothing, he sees nothing He's all alone His love is gone If you ever left me, I'd be in despair, like him My page Guillaume, with Agnès? I didn't know they were in love They're not For them, it's a game They toy with love That's the one who truly loves Guillaume Louison? She hides and watches them She wants to cry She's ugly, no one loves her If she loves him, why is she ugly? It's not fair It makes me sad, too I don't want you to be sad tonight She's so pretty now! It's nothing The devilish beauty of youth I don't believe in the Devil! You're lucky My name is Anne Anne you're the most marvelous creature I ever met I'm so happy I'll never forget you If this is just a dream, I hope I never wake up Why do you laugh? Isn't it funny? You just met me, and already, you say you love me Time is unimportant I love you That's just how it is How can I believe that? Before, you had nothing but scorn for love "Before" is already far away Now you're near me That's what matters I must be dreaming! Where did you come from? Who are you? Who am I? You just said it A woman who's near you, in your arms Come, Anne Renaud? With another woman? As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far I thanked Heaven for leading me to you Alas, I must leave soon I don't want you to leave Take this ring If we're ever apart, it will remind you of me Your mind is elsewhere Your thoughts also seem far away Who gave you that chain? Who gave you that ring? You're in a pitiful state Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles The Devil treats his children well If they obey him well Remember Remember What's written is written! You signed a pact with him! Gilles and Dominique Dominique and Gilles Who pretend to love Remember Remember You must continue It's your destiny: Seduction, Corruption, Villainy Then to leave in despair Those who believed your sweet whispers! Monsters Always monsters We won't sleep tonight Did you want to? - Don't laugh - Why not? If I find it amusing, what's wrong with that? You haven't given me much reason to laugh since we've lived together Be quiet! Why stir up long-dead things? Who killed them? Did I? Did you? Or both? Who nipped in the bud Our story of love? Enough! You know we never really loved each other We'd known too many before we met, played at love too many times - Be quiet! Why? Feeling remorseful? Remorse! Too bad I've heard it helps pass the time If I felt remorse, it might help, wouldn't it? But why would I? Men have loved me, as they like to whisper in my ear I let them Is it my fault if they wept, gave everything for me, even their lives? The young men were passionate, the old men crawled at my feet When did I ever cry or throw myself at your feet? You're different Greedy, stubborn, proud You just want to be loved, to take without giving, to keep it all and leave Like you! You hunted me like a cat hunts a mouse But we're both cats, there is no mouse It's not our fault We both thought we'd caught a tender new victim Two executioners, face to face and no one to torture! How sad! - Enough! If you'd truly loved me, I might have loved you If you'd truly loved me, I, too, might have loved you Go on Scare me Hit me Kill me Slit my throat My handsome love What's the point? What is signed, is signed Aren't we happy? Others love us, they suffer for us We watch them and we go away A lovely trip and the Devil picks up the bill Good night, Gilles Want to know where I'm going? I already know Where will you spend the night? Obviously! It'd be a shame to disturb her dreams Such tender creatures should be wooed in daylight Baron Hugues! What do you want at this hour, young man? How dare you knock at my door? I don't know, a sudden impulse Don't be angry, even if you can't understand I'm in grave danger I feel so alone, so helpless Touch my heart Feel how it pounds! Alas, it's true, I belong to the weaker sex So weak! You alone know my secret As soon as I saw you, I knew why I'd traveled so far I thanked Heaven for leading me to you Who are you? Where did you come from? I abandoned everything to escape a terrible fate, but I'm still so troubled I need help and advice How can I help you when I myself live in the past, in my memories? It's not good to live in the past I try to forget everything Alas, my brother is only my brother and I am so alone So am I, child When my wife died, I lost my desire to live How you must have loved her! Yes We loved each other Love is a beautiful thing It was long ago I'm old now Don't say that If one is young at heart, that's true youth Gilles She's in her bed She's in her bed She sleeps and dreams she is yours You must make her wait The more she waits The more she'll love you The more she loves you The more she'll suffer! What is your desire, now that I've confided in you? What is my desire? Why ask such a question? What do I desire? I desire you, totally, completely, and you know it! You're so blunt Sorry to offend Perhaps it's no way to woo women, but I speak my mind I said you were blunt, not that I didn't like it Too many who call themselves men tremble and sigh for their sweethearts Dominique And you said you don't know how to talk to women! The way you talk, who'd believe your wedding is so near? Leave the wedding out of it It's cruel of you to remind me Is it true that traditionally, the newlyweds' chamber is prepared and left open well in advance of the wedding? Yes, that's our custom A lovely tradition I'd love to see the chamber How commendable, this bedroom awaiting a young couple destined for each other Be quiet Everything about it expresses peace and happiness Peace happiness Since I met you, they don't matter Peace and happiness no longer matter to me It's a shame to rise so early when we're so happy in bed! Alone in bed, how can I be happy? Why alone? The castle's full of pretty girls Take a look And my heart is yours Will we have the pleasure of Anne's company? I doubt it My daughter doesn't enjoy hunting You seem troubled Did you sleep well? It's been years since that happened What a shame, for isn't night made for sleeping? Did you sleep well, my lady? I had a marvelous night Why so gloomy? It's a joyous day Why not invite those two minstrels whose songs you so appreciated? You didn't seem to appreciate them last night I can admit when I'm wrong Let's take them with us Agnès! Quickly, dress me! How kind of you to join us! It's a lovely surprise Should not all your pleasures become mine? I hope you also know hunting songs We have songs for every hour of the day — and night That minstrel has a peculiar voice, doesn't he? He's young He laughs like a child Hunting is so sad I love birds! Don't worry No bird shall be caught I promise The birds are my friends, too It's strange, you show no fear or surprise at things that surprise others, that frighten them Why be frightened? Life is full of mysteries, isn't it? A bird, an apple, a beast, the sun, the trees in these woods Even us: we don't know from whence we come or where we go Isn't that marvelous? The water is so sweet Your lips are sweet, too I love you, Anne Gilles! What's wrong? I don't know I was so happy, then suddenly, I thought of Renaud He also said, "I love you, Anne" But with the same hard voice in which he says: "I love my dogs I love hunting I love killing whatever flies or leaps" "I love you, Anne You'll be mine forever" Forever Is it possible for a person to totally belong to another? Some call that love Then is love like death? We no longer exist? It's all over? Why? If you love me, don't hurt me, don't lock me up, let me live! Love me as I love you — simply It's impossible! What would your daughter say? And Renaud? Nothing It is not their place to speak When I speak, people listen and remain silent! I want — Do you hear me? I want you to take off these men's clothes - Right now? - What are you saying? Nothing You speak, I remain silent Don't laugh I want them to bow to you in awe of your beauty when they see you in a dress See me in a dress? Is that all you desire? Why tempt a man whose life is over? Do you cling, like ivy, to your memories? I implore you How can you be so unfeeling? Do you wish to make me unhappy? Me? Make you unhappy? Since you're here, I feel 20 years younger I'm a different man Why do you blame me? I blame you for nothing, dear child Renaud! I'd lost my quarry, so I was looking for you Like you, undoubtedly Obviously, you wouldn't understand, but Dominique Dominique, here with us, is a woman Truly? Truly She's in grave danger She requested my protection Only you and I know her secret Truly? Truly I hear our friends We'd better join them What game are you playing? What do you mean? He kneeled, he kissed your hands Don't I deserve homage? Women like to please What's wrong with that? Dominique! I'm only teasing The baron was suspicious He questioned me and I answered - That's all - That's all? Are you jealous of an old man? Me, jealous? Now do you believe that a person can totally belong to another - Gilles - without being unhappy? I'm happy And you? Me? Why would I be happy? Because I'm here with you? Because I held you in my arms? To me, that's happiness Happiness! How boring! It's incredible, the only thought in such a pretty head, always the same thought: Happiness! It's all so terribly absurd, tragic, monotonous and banal! What "Gilles"? What do you want from "Gilles"? What does "Gilles" mean? Maybe my name isn't even Gilles! I beseech you don't laugh that way! Such a sad laugh! Why not? Would you rather I burst into tears or roll at your feet because you love me? I love you and I know you love me too Listen carefully Anne, my friend, I don't love you Be quiet It's not true! You don't know what you're saying! Please don't look at me that way It's heartrending! Is it my fault if I've never loved? - Be quiet - Hush! It isn't worth a single tear, it's nothing but a story invented to amuse the Devil Believe me, no one loves anyone Everyone pretends! They stalk their prey, set traps And happiness — Since you believe it exists... Might be, especially for you, to avoid those traps You're leaving? Yes If you knew how much I love you, you'd have no choice but to love me I now reveal this secret, which previously, only Renaud and I knew A woman? Remember, Baron? I noticed this minstrel's "peculiar" voice They aren't minstrels They are of noble birth and deserve to be honored They'll dine at my table, and at the tournament, I'll wear their colors! - Well said! - Yes, truly Well said Curious story, isn't it? Were you aware of it? - No The young man didn't tell you this afternoon in the woods? Did the young lady tell you last night in the garden? During their stay, it is your duty to amuse them An easy task, for they seem well-equipped to amuse us Why are you so ill-humored? Why have you suddenly recovered your desire to live? Is it possible that Dominique is truly your sister? Such an innocent question Answer me If Dominique were my sister, do you think I'd squander my time and pleasure to travel with her? You love her? To speak truly, she is my only love Why take such pleasure in seeing me suffer? Why? I knew you loved me! Alas! We are under a spell and once it dissipates, you'll see me as I truly am, miserable and alone I love you! I belong to the Devil I'm among his friends If you love me, it's probably thanks to him Why torture yourself like that? I believed myself utterly alone, yet since I've found you, I'm even more lost, more alone, more desperate To me, you are all the love in the world and all I can bring you is sorrow and despair Hold me in your arms Once more, tell me you love me You are so simple, so young, so sweet and so alive! Protect me Teach me to live Before I met you, I only pretended My heart was like ice My love, be happy and at peace My body is close to yours, your heart beats with mine, our bodies, our hearts are one Nothing can ever separate us! I love you And no one — Do you hear? No one can stop me from loving you! What strange weather! It's true! There wasn't a cloud in the sky You should've moved your knight! Too late I've made my move What is it? A lord caught in the storm requests hospitality for the night Excuse me, I must welcome this unexpected guest I'm honored to welcome you to my home Thank you - You come from afar? - Very far! I'm quite a traveler! Excuse me The storm caught me by surprise I don't fear lightning, but getting soaked to the skin is terribly unpleasant Such a lovely fire! I like fire It likes me too The flames are so attentive They lap at my fingers like a hound A pleasant sensation! Forgive me for not introducing myself, although, coming from afar, my name and title mean little to you Forgotten in my homeland, unknown abroad, such is the traveler's fate! But I'm delighted to find myself in such gallant company! - I hope you'll join us for dinner? - With pleasure! Did I interrupt your game? No matter I'd lost from the start You think so? Checkmate You win Chess is so simple! I didn't know your daughter will soon be wed! Forgive me for intruding on this family occasion! I hope your fiancé isn't vexed by my ill-timed visit Dominique is not my fiancé No? You'd make a lovely couple Don't you agree? You look astonishingly like one of my daughters I'm flattered - You have daughters? - Yes! I have many children, boys and girls, but I must admit, I prefer girls, especially ones like you I prefer girls Boys are ungrateful No sense of duty, disobedient I'm not a hard man, but I detest I detest being disobeyed! We all have our foibles, don't we? Tell me, Baron, where is your daughter? Shall we see her tonight? I doubt it She's already retired A slight illness I think it's a caprice Already? It's tragic to leave her all alone in her room with her "caprice" What a shame! I'd have loved to meet her Since you resemble my daughter, would you intervene in favor of someone fetching the sweet bride-to-be? Please, Baron? It'd make me so happy What wouldn't I do to make you happy? Come, Renaud You'll talk to her Why do you laugh? Why? How curious! You laugh, yet don't know why! Perhaps you laughed simply because it's good to laugh once in a while Surely you laughed because you sensed something will happen that's absolutely tragic! Alas, even the best of us rejoice in the troubles of others! It's only human But you wouldn't have dared to laugh if I hadn't laughed first Don't be surprised by my clairvoyance! I only use my talents for the good of all There's no need to peek through keyholes to know what happens in ladies' chambers and men's hearts! A lady is to wed a young man, but she loves another A banal story! He joins her in her room, but he gets caught! How sad If they are caught together, what happens? Her lover is beaten, arrested by the guards! They drag him to the stairs He stumbles, then gets up, only to fall under more blows! This man has odiously abused my hospitality He will be punished - You summoned me? - This man is a dog! Treat him as such! So be it Chain him up with the other dogs! Not a bad start! How can I ever forgive you for this? And you, sire, do you hold the sister responsible for her brother's crimes? My heart is in shreds Your suffering pains me Forgive me, we've just met, but it's sad to see you in such a state Let's stroll in the garden The fresh air will do you good I don't know why, but that man scares me I'm glad you don't blame this young woman for her brother's unfortunate conduct It's the mark of a generous soul and a chivalrous heart She's so fortunate to have found here all the affection she deserves - We care for her a lot - Quite right! She merits every respect And why not love? What a pretty ring! May I? I adore jewelry Marvelous craftsmanship Judge for yourself This initial, this D! It's so finely engraved, this D! Don't you agree? Who are you? How did you get in? I'm the Devil! I could care less What? Don't you understand? I'm the Devil! Yes, the Devil How else can I be here and elsewhere at once? Yes, elsewhere For example, in the garden If Dominique loves me, what can you do about it? Absolutely nothing! Please, there's no need for violence! What's so marvelous about that? I'm here, locked in my room, but am I not also at the fountain where my beloved held me in his arms? You speak like a child, for you don't know my power Just watch - You're jealous, that's all! - Me? It's written all over your face "Dominique, what wouldn't I do to make you happy?" You cling to her skirts, cater to her whims You smile like a kind father, but your eyes betray your desire! Wretch! What's wretched and laughable is an old man begging for love! You shouldn't have done that Gentlemen! Surely you won't kill each other in the garden, under your daughter's window? You're right - Tomorrow we shall duel as knights - To the death! Excellent idea! If something terrible should happen, everyone will consider it an unfortunate accident - It's awful! - Not at all! Nothing will befall your father I'll watch over him Leave me alone I'm not listening For me, you don't exist Maybe not for you, but for others Gilles, for example Poor, miserable Gilles Be quiet Gilles is no longer miserable He'll never be miserable because we love each other Rejoice, Gilles! It seems you're miserable no more! Here you are, chained up like a dog, waiting for the executioner to rip out your nails, gorge you with water, sew your eyelids shut, break a few bones! Naturally, none of this will trouble your happiness, the glorious happiness of love It's true I'm happy Poor fool! You won't get away with it That'd be too easy! Have you forgotten? If you possess someone even once, they belong to me forever! Do what you will with me, but Anne belongs to no one She is free You have no power over her You think she's all yours? For always? Poor Gilles, look what you're reduced to! A brilliant boy like you, caught in the pitiful traps of love You should know better Want an example? This place is full of them Listen, instead Can't you hear the Baron tiptoeing through the castle? Excuse me, I was simply passing by Returning to my room after a moonlight stroll Lovely night, isn't it? I couldn't sleep So I got up and went for a walk I understand completely I sleep like a baby, so I pity those who don't Excuse me, Baron, but I'm exhausted Good night I'm grateful you didn't hide this from me, but now I'm frantic with worry I'm afraid to lose you Death in a duel is simple and swift, with barely time to suffer and none to think I admire how you speak of death so lightly! I'm not talking of my own death Since I met you, I'm filled with a ferocious lust for life A life with you With me, close to me In your arms, forever When the Baron struck me, I lost all respect for him Tomorrow, after the duel, we'll run away together Truly? You'd abandon everything for me? Once the Baron is dead, do you think I'd stay here with Anne and your brother's lovesick wailing under our window each night? Please, don't talk about poor Gilles! Don't add to my pain I'm already so afraid for your life Have no fear My life's in no danger Look how fine the links are in this Italian chain mail! Here we can't make them this pretty or this strong With this and a bit of luck, even the worst blows can't harm me A fine proof of love, if you're in no danger! Don't you see? It's only to reassure you I'd fight bare-chested if you wished it I fear no man, nor the Devil, nor death! "Nor the Devil, nor death" You please me well, Renaud So confident, so dangerous! Tomorrow, wear this under your doublet You'll remember the warmth of my body as you fight to keep me Anne, my love, my true love! Anne, you are as beautiful as the day! I love you madly! Give me your lips! Leave me alone You aren't Gilles - What? You aren't Gilles You look like Gilles, you have his voice, but Gilles would never say such things If you say so Then who am I? It's easy to guess You're the one who came yesterday You called yourself the Devil, the Demon, the Deceiver Since you can't be fooled It's true, you are the Deceiver You may even deceive yourself There are some things that escape you Escape me? Poor idiot! Nothing escapes me No one can escape me, not even you! You don't know my powers! I hold the world in my hands! That's right! Storms, rain, hail, wind, shipwrecks: that's me! Sickness, war and all its pleasures, pestilence, famine, misery, murder, hatred, jealousy That's me, always me! And death Me, again! With such an existence, I can see why you're not happy! Me, not happy? I'm so easily amused! I find the troubles of this world most entertaining They warm my heart, make me laugh Yes, they make me laugh But I hate laughing by myself Do you hear me? Why don't you answer? What are you thinking of, wretch? A song my governess once sang, she said it was the fairies... I detest fairies! I detest stories like that! When the two lovers' hearts Beat as one Enough! If you ever sing that again, I'll turn you to stone! Even if you turned me into a hag, or a dead serpent, it wouldn't matter to me because my love would still live "Her love" She dares mention her love! Don't forget, treacherous creature, that you've done wrong You've sinned If it's a sin to give myself to the one I love, I don't regret it Truly? You should be ashamed! Ashamed? Why? I don't even know what shame is! Shame is what we hide If you're not ashamed of your love, why not shout it from the rooftops? Why not tell the whole town? Why not? Listen! I've been locked in this room to keep me from the one I love I've no wish to wound anyone, but I love Gilles Not only do I love him, I have but one desire: to be near him, to share his fate, for better or for worse "For worse" You can count on that, dear girl The sin of scandal is the greatest sin Your poor daughter must be possessed by a demon! Poor Anne It breaks my heart to treat her like this, but as the shame was public, so must be the punishment Sad lost children We wander through the night Where are day's blooms? Love's pleasures? Life's radiance? Sad lost children We wander through the night The Devil treacherously whisks us away The Devil whisks us away Far from our lovely ladies Our youth is dust And our loves too How beautiful! How beautiful to hear it sung with such sadness! It melts my heart It's true, and I enjoy it Sing some more, for me You don't want to? You don't want to hurt me, to make me cry, to make me as tender as a little lamb? Too bad! You're determined not to please me So be it! But take heed, I'll be back Renaud ordered me to modify your face and body so terribly that no woman will ever love you! Forget such things Close your eyes, like I close mine Forget your chains Take me to our fountain It's so like you to forget your chains, to take refuge in happy memories! Alas, I am here! I have no ill intentions Memories are lovely, but the past is gone forever! The present is what counts and right now, some surprising things are happening! Look how clear the water is, like a cloudless sky What silence! A deathly silence A grand tournament Lovely ladies, fine weather, noble lords There's your humble servant, seated on Dominique's right. What a show! Everyone is enjoying it Gilles, they'll fight to the death, I know it It's true, one of them must die Don't worry As a favor, I'll let you decide Give me a name Don't answer There's no point He's already decided Victory! You see? A little blood can ruin the clearest water! You should get some rest You're exhausted Renaud I already considered him as a son This is the hand that struck him These things happen It was just bad luck He died at my hand Bells, always bells! What an odd custom! Yes, a man is dead, but why make so much noise? Those bells are exasperating! And Baron Hugues! Poor Baron, isn't he exasperating with his empty words, his suffering, his remorse, his heavy sighs? Dominique, you should take him away Where? I don't know Anywhere To the Devil, as they say! Out of my sight, out of everyone's sight! It'd be pleasant to stay here for a while And Anne What do you think of her? She's a charming creature, isn't she? I've never seen anyone like her Do you think she really loves Gilles? If she loves him, she's capable of loving someone else Who? Are you jealous, my dear? I was a child when you met me You know I'm incapable of suffering I feel no pain, no joy, no pleasure Is it really necessary for me to take this old man away? Yes, his time has come He's lived long enough He's had his fill It's a shame I'd have preferred to take the other one At least he was young You shouldn't take these affairs so seriously They're as old as the world, and just as worn out Yes, it'd be very pleasant indeed Anne may your chains fall Appear in the garden, on this bench Anne? Anne! What's going on? Never happened before Anne? Finally! You kept me waiting, dear You know I'm not here of my own will I'm so terribly sorry, but do me the pleasure of sitting with me Please don't cry! It hurts to see such a pretty face twisted in sorrow Leave me alone My heart is sad, so sad I'm not used to unhappiness and now Gilles is in prison, threatened by the executioner, Renaud is dead, and my father is in despair Could you be the cause of all these troubles? What do you expect? No one loves me I amuse myself as best I can If you only knew how sensitive I am, how the slightest thing wounds me! Whenever there's a new joy in the world, or a new love shines, you can't imagine my suffering! I'd cry if only I had tears I assure you, if someone loved me, it'd help so much Life would be so easy and pleasant if only you tried to understand me Truly, the love Gilles offers is derisory! Whereas I But that's quite impossible, for I love Gilles Gilles! What use is he? Do you think he hears you? Yes, he hears me because I love him Anne … Gilles She's calling me I hear her Anne, have no fear I love you! Don't listen to him! He has no power over you! Anne, my love! My life! Alas, I fear my poor brother has lost his wits It's possible Sometimes I think I'm losing mine My guilty love for you made me kill Renaud Why are you dressed like that? I'm leaving I feel guilty, too And yet, my wrongdoing was involuntary Who can blame you for being beautiful and desirable? You don't know the whole truth Renaud fought without chain mail to please me That's why your blow killed him How horrible! Why did you do it? You have to ask? I believed Renaud quicker and stronger than you I feared the worst, I feared losing you Dominique Yes, my lord, I did it out of love for you You say you love me, yet you are leaving? I must go My life is yours now You know I can't allow you to go alone Wherever you go, I'll go Alas, my lord, how could I ask you to abandon everything for me? Dominique! Don't forget your promise, my lord "Wherever you go, I'll go" Dominique! You'll be mine because you love Gilles and it's the only way to save him If I wish, I can make him the most miserable creature in the world! Impossible! Surely, you couldn't? Yes! I can transform him into any horrible thing I choose! No, I beg you! I can also make him forget you and send him on his way, carefree, without memories or regrets Alive, like everyone else He can't forget me Everyone forgets! He'll forget immediately You'll forget later But I don't want to! If he forgets me, I'll never love another You prefer the company of a monster who remembers you? At heart, I'm not a bad devil I can make you happy, believe me Your every wish will be my command I have only one wish: to return to Gilles in the prison where he calls me - Be quiet! - I want to be with Gilles Anne … Can't you hear him calling? Anne! Anne! Gilles Anne She makes a fool of me! And yet, I love her! I was too sweet, too obliging That's no way to win a woman! All that will change! Why so sad, Anne? Look at me, think of me as if it were the last time What do you mean? Nothing I don't know I love you so much that I fear one day you'll forget me Forget you? But, Anne, I'd rather forget to breathe, forget to live I hope I'm not disturbing you! Excuse me I'm waiting for your answer I don't know the question, but don't answer It's a trap Nothing keeps you here, dear child, now that your father is gone - My father? - Don't worry about him! He left with Dominique All's well that ends well There is a slight age difference But what does it matter? They love one another Enough about them Let's talk about us And him Since he still interests you Be quiet! Leave her alone! I know my fate is in your hands, but what do I care? I love her and you have no power over her How do you know? Anne, let's talk seriously Gilles wrote this himself and signed it in his own hand with his blood It was wrong, but he did it It's too late now Give me your answer If I say yes to you, he'll be free forever? As free as a bird, like a fish in the water Don't listen to him! Please, Anne Will you accept to follow me, to try to love me? Yes Finally! What gorgeous sunshine! And what a lovely castle! What? I'm imprisoned? No, you're not You're free, totally free! That's much better! Can you tell me where we are, who this castle belongs to? Is it yours? It doesn't matter! I've no wish to know you I don't like how you smile at me Anyway, none of this matters I feel like laughing, for I'm alive! The sun is shining, what more could I want? You're so beautiful! One only sees such creatures in dreams You're the prettiest girl in the world Why are you so sad? - This is no place for you - Is she your daughter? No, she's not my daughter I understand, and I understand her sorrow Life can be unfair Youth should be spent with other youths Perhaps she loves you Anyway, it doesn't concern me Excuse me I kept my promise You're mine now Forever! No What do you mean, "No"? I can't believe it! You promised You swore I lied That's impossible You don't know how You couldn't lie! All the same, I lied That's the truth It's impossible! Anne, pure as snow, clearer than spring water, Anne, the only person in the world I trusted! Why did you do such a thing? How dare you! All's fair in love To save Gilles, I'd have done much worse I've lost him I'll never love again And yet, without recognizing me, he found me beautiful and told me so Be quiet! If you keep talking like that, there's no telling what I'll do! Do whatever you wish, but please, let me return once more to the fountain where I was happy So be it Is that you? What luck has led me here? Are you alone? Yes The old man with you is gone? Yes Now I'm even happier Are you thirsty? The water is so sweet! Your lips are sweet, too Gilles! Anne! My love I knew I couldn't lose you Anne! Get away from him! No Nothing can separate us now For the last time, get away from him! To stone, do you hear me? I'll turn you to stone! The silence I adore Deathly silence What's that? What's that noise? It's their hearts! Their hearts beating! Still beating! Beating!
