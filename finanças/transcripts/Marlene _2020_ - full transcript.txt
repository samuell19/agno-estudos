What!? Don't hurt me. Okay, okay, we can talk ... It's all there. Good. Then get it to Amon. Were there any difficulties? Not really. I know you need a break, but ... .. there's one last thing you need to do for me. No women, no children. You're not supposed to kill her, just bring her to me. Why? She's the daughter of someone who didn't stick to an agreement. With her help I can remind him ... .. how important it is to stick to agreements. If you're not up for it, I'll ask Amon. But I'd prefer it if you did this for me. You know how he is. Of course. No problem. Are you okay? - Why shouldn't I be? - I don't know, you seem ... .. tense. It's because of that job last week. What about it? Was that man innocent? Possibly. But you're in my employ long enough to know ... .. that I can't afford to appear weak. Or tolerate mistakes. Mistakes were made and I reacted accordingly. Mistakes call for punishment, as you well know, Frank. Hi Mom. How are you? I'm not doing so well. I've been crying a lot recently. A while ago ... I remembered how Dad left us. When I cried and couldn't sleep, remember? You came in, laid down with me ... .. took me in your arms. You said nothing, not a word. You just held me. All night. Until I stopped crying. I knew everything would be okay. I knew. Now I often lie in bed alone and I just have to cry. I'm not so sure now if everything's going to be okay. Hi. Hello. What can I get you? My friend over there would like to invite you to a drink. Thanks, but I don't have time. My friend would be really sad if you don't have a drink with him. Tell him I don't have time and if he wants something he should come over himself. I'll tell him. Well? Yes? What can I invite you to? I already told your friend I don't have time, so right now nothing. - I think you're pretty. - Thanks, that's sweet, but I'm not interested. Pick another girl, there are enough girls here. But I want to have a drink with you. But I don't want to, so please either order something or piss off. Don't be so unfriendly. Other girls would be happy. So go to one who digs your tired James Bond get up and leave me be! Shut up. - Okay, then. See you on Thursday. - Yes. Get home safely. - You too. - Sleep in tomorrow. - Yeah. Bye! - Ciao! Well, well! If it isn't the sassy waitress! So you didn't find a girl who digs you, huh? You see, the thing is that I dig you the most. Hey ... I just want to go home. I'm tired. Okay? I'm not up for this. - I'm totally up for this. - Come on, please let me go. You dirty bitch. Huh? What do you say now? What do you say now? Huh? Stop it now, you already showed her who's boss. Shut up, now I'm really going to show her ... - Leave the girl and piss off. - You piss off. Stop this shit, you idiot! Fuck off, you coward. - Is everything okay? - Yeah, I think so, yes. I don't think you should drive now. I can give you a lift. Makes more sense. Yes, yes. Yes please. Maybe you should have just had that drink with James Bond. Yes, maybe. - Left, right? - Left. Drive in here. Okay. Thanks for everything. No need to thank me. Your ... ... Your wound should be cleaned up. This is going to sting a little. Is everything okay? Thank you. Why is life like this? How is it? So ... so intense. Good morning. Good morning. Marlene. Frank. Coffee? Yes. Black? - M-hm. - Coming up. About yesterday ... I'm uncomfortable about what happened. No worries. It's okay. - How's your head? - Better. Thank you. So, what do you do? I mean, when you're not saving strange women from rapists and watching them cry all night. Actually, that's exactly what I do. - Really? - Yes, on weekends. During the week I help old people and children cross the street. Wow. Crazy. And does that pay well? I get by, yes. Frank? There's an old classic playing in the Opern cinema. And I'd like to see it again ... maybe you want to join me? I'd like that. Cool. Cool. Well, then ... it's on at five already. Then I'll pick you up at half past four. Yes, that's good. Well, then ... - See you later. - See you then. Hey. Hey. It's nice here, isn't it? M-hm. - Do you come here often? - M-hm. It's my favorite spot. - But that's top secret. - I see. I can think here. How did you like the film? Erm ... Exciting. It was exciting, but I'm not really a horror fan. - Not? - No. - So you were a little scared? - No. - A little? - A little. And you like that? - Getting creeped out? - M-hm. Yes, I do. At the movies. At the movies I like that. Once in a while. I can't remember the last time I was at the movies. Feels like forever. Same here. It's been ages. The last time I went was with my mom. - Really? - Yes. Do you meet your parents often? No. Not really. My mom died last year. I'm sorry. It's still tough for me. She was my best friend, you know. And, well, my father ran off when I was little. Turned his back on my mom and me. Just left. In the beginning he sent me cards and stuffed animals on birthdays, but that stopped when I turned twelve. Mom once said that he was involved with some shady business in Vienna, but she never said more about it. Thank God. I wasn't interested. I don't care for my father and he doesn't care for me. And you? - What? - What do your parents do? My parents are dead. Car accident. When I was little. Really? - That's horrible. - Yes. It all worked out anyway. That's true. You still became a superhero. - Thanks for everything. - For what? For the nice evening. And the driving. And I can't thank you enough for yesterday. I think everything will be okay. Go, Dad! Go! Hello, Frank. Where is she? Please. Put your gun down. - Where is Marlene? - She's gone. Lola took her. And now please put your gun down. He's here now. Frank! You were hard to reach in the last couple days. Seems like you forgot about your actual job. What happens to her now? You know what happens. I want to teach her father a lesson. And if that doesn't work? You know that too, Frank. She doesn't know him, you can't blackmail him with her. You're obviously overworked and can't think straight. I should have asked Amon. Be that as it may. I want to you to take some time off and relax. So you can see things clearly again. Use the time. And come back when your priorities are back in order. So you fell for this chick. Did you think that would work? The two of you? Have you told her what you do? How you earn your money? You forgot your job because of a girl, you forgot us because of a girl and what's worse is you forgot him because of a girl. Did you really think you could get away with that just because you're you? I know we never got along, Frank. However, you should take my advice. Forget this girl. Maybe ... .. go see a whore. Let off some steam. And once you're back on track ... .. you come back to us. I can't let you in. Let me through, I need to clear something up. - Strict orders from Amon. - Call him and tell him I'm here. It's important. Call him and tell him I'm here! If you insist. Boss, Frank's here. He wants to get into the club. Okay. Frank. How nice. Please, take a seat. How was your vacation? I want to see her. Sorry, no can do. She's with him. - Hey! Hey! - Let me through. I can't let you go up there, stop this shit. I think the boss told you not to show up here until the whole business with the girl and her father is cleared up. So what are you doing here? - I said let me through. - Who do you think you are? You asshole. You're not defying me, you're defying him. Show a little more respect! Oh, please. Really? Drop your fucking gun. Drop your fucking gun or Lola will give you a facelift. You're done here. Everyone knows you betrayed us - and he is devastated. Do you know what he said? He said that if you showed up about this bitch we should break all your bones. To make you more aware of your mistake. His words. Get this asshole out of here, Harry. And if he returns before the next full moon, then beat him to a pulp. Forget the fucking bitch! Or we will forget you! What was that? Oh God! What if it's my father? I will go and take a look. Outstanding. It's a masterpiece. So well done. Honey, can you get that? I'm cooking. - Sweetie, please! - I've got it! - Frank? - Is it Elfi? Felix ... - What's up with you? - I need your help. - Please. - It's not a good time right now ... Tell her I can't go to the mall, I gotta cook! It's not Elfi! This is really bad, this won't work ... Okay, go into the living room, fast. So Kathi doesn't see you. Go in so she doesn't see you. What is he doing here? - Hello Kathi. - Frank. Erm, he was in the neighborhood and just wanted to come borrow something. He really dressed up for us. He needs help. Why won't he go to the fucking hospital? Sweetie, he won't stay long. I'll just help him a little and then he's gone, okay? Please. Ten minutes. Then dinner's ready. Then he needs to leave. Great, thanks. Come on in. Sit down. You can't imagine what went on here when she burnt her first chili. Here. For your face. Thanks. So what's going on? I need an audience with the Empress. Dude, you know the Empress doesn't want to see me again! - Do you still have her number? - Of course I have her number. Not on the xenomorph, please. Of course I have her number, but I'm definitely not going to call her. I'm out. I don't hack any more servers, I don't listen in on people and I don't check them out. I don't want any trouble, okay? Felix, I wouldn't be here if this wasn't really important. Please. Then tell me what the hell is going on, Frank. What happened? It all started ... .. about a year ago. I can barely sleep. My hand shakes ... .. and I get panic attacks. I even know why. It's that castle. His fucking castle. And they never get enough, he never gets enough. It's all about getting more and more. And they'll never stop. He always ... .. told me we only kill the bad guys. And I actually believed him. But then I realized ... .. we were the bad guys. That I'm the bad guy. In the beginning it was human traffickers, murderers, dealers, pimps â€“ but then the jobs changed. He told me lies about the targets. He invented crimes that never happened. The only crime they committed is that they earned too little money to pay for his fucking protection. Or whatever else he wants from them. Felix, I think ... I think I have ... .. killed some good people. I didn't want that. I lived ... I lived my life the wrong way. Now I'm one of the bad guys. But Marlene ... .. is the first good thing in my life. To help her and to be with her just feels so right. Not to bring her to him, not to do the job, that was the first time I did the right thing. Now she's with him. Alone in his castle. Now I can either ... look away ... .. and let her die ... or I destroy his goddamn empire and get her out of there. But if I want to go in there, I need special equipment. So I'm asking you to get me an audience with the Empress. Please. Sweetie ... What are you looking at me for? Pick up your phone and call the Empress! Now! Come on, Frank. I'll take care of your wounds, they look bad. I have a great ointment. And a fresh shirt of Felix's that will fit you. Are you hungry? I made a good chili! Okay. Be there in an hour. - Thanks. - Pleasure. So what's your plan? Go through the front gate and shoot your way through to her? The front door is made of ten feet of solid steel, so no. I'll go through the cellar, the club and on to the west wing. That's madness, Frank. I know. But it's right. Thank you both. And Frank, if you don't die you're both invited to dinner. I'd love to meet Marlene. Hello, Frank. Hello, Frank. The last time I sold you something you eliminated six of my best customers. Why do you think I would help you now? I'm marching into battle. That's not my problem. I'm marching into battle against the lord of the castle. You and who else? Just me. Just you? Just you alone? You amuse me. So, what do you need? I need handguns, hand grenades and smokeballs, knives for close combat and something with great penetrating power. You know, I always knew this moment would come. The moment you turned against him. This was never your world. Come. I'll get you what you need. About the payment ... If you're really about to do what you said, then this is a gift. Bye, Frank. Bye, Frank. Ciao, Frank! Oh sorry! Sorry! Sorry! What? Sorry! Sorry! How dare you just come in here? I should ... - Frank's on his way into the club and he's heavily armed! What? Now you're getting a headache. You first. To everyone: Frank's on his way into the castle. I want you to stop him. If he resists then kill him. You bastard! You shot my friends! Now I kill you, you son of a bitch! Damn, empty again. The toilet, shit. The bastard's behind me. He's coming up and shooting everyone. What ... what's he doing? Where's he running to? I think he's running directly towards the back room. Oh fuck. Tanja. Tanja? Can you hear me? Tanja, Frank's on his way to you and he's heavily armed. Tanja! Fuck it. Frank is on ... Always the same thing ... What's your plan? I need to warn him. And I should tell him what Frank's doing here. Listen. Under no circumstances can we let Frank get into the west wing. If our men can't stop him ... .. then it's up to you and me. Do you understand? Good. Grenade! Shoot! Shoot! We don't have to do this. Just bring me to her and the battle's over. The battle hasn't even started yet. Where is Lola? Oh no. Oh fuck. Shit. I hope you can hear me. Yes. You hear me. Who would have thought that you'd actually do this tonight, huh? You crazy asshole. You know, I've been thinking. Do you remember the job we did in Warsaw? That warehouse? How many were there â€“ 30, 40 men? In my memory we killed them all in the blink of an eye. I must confess I still think about this job sometimes, with pride. But we missed someone, remember? That old Polish guy who hid in that fucking closet. He suddenly came out of hiding, his gun drawn. How far away was he â€“ 50, 60 feet? He shot at you and you shot at him. You needed three shots to hit him. Three shots. Was it after that that you asked him to only put you up for close combat? Be that as it may. In any case, I noticed something for the first time, in Warsaw. I saw your hand shaking. You may still be unrivaled in close combat. But in a duel ... .. you will lose. You're no longer a danger to me, Frank. I want to know if your hand is still shaking. I'm coming to get you now. See you soon. Tuck in that gun. I want to know if your hand is still shaking. Stand up! All of this ... .. just because of that ... .. Marlene? Frank. Father. I never thought it would come to this, between us. Yes? I kind of saw it coming. Possible. You always were your mother's son more than mine. You know, I was always angry at her. First I was angry that she took her own life. And left me alone with you. But the older I got the angrier I became that she didn't wait. That she didn't wait for me to get older and stronger and free her from you. To free us both from you. Your mother never loved us. She wouldn't have killed herself if she did. But I, Frank. I always gave you all my love. You don't love me. You use me. The same way you use everyone around you. You caused my mother's death. You stole my childhood. I was never able to do the things every other child normally does. No, I had to train, grow stronger, so that I could take care of your enemies. The only person you ever loved is yourself. I'm sorry to hear that. I admit I made mistakes. The way I see it ... .. my biggest mistake was ... .. that I didn't show you your limits. And you know mistakes call for punishment. I'm so sorry. - You don't have to be. - I'm so sorry. - Everything will be okay. - I know. subtitles: AUDIO2 &amp; Steve Furry
