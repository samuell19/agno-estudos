Bombardier, report. Target totally obscured, Colonel Brandon. Can't see a damn thing. Navigator, veer course to secondary target. -That strike report in? -Due any minute now, Art. -Coffee? -Yeah. Let's hope Colonel Brandon beat that storm front. Not likely. You just get the weather reports right and leave the flying to us, Jacoby. Anyway, there's always a secondary target. No, Sir. That'll be socked in, too. Well, that's bad luck. Major Varga? The strike report is coming in. -Oh, hell. -What did you expect? A little luck. Art, there any word yet? "Mission scrubbed. Heading home." Is that all? Gabby, Greg's luck is bound to get better. You think he should've asked for a stand-down today, don't you? I think he'll get them back safely. Pilot to Radio, Red Leader's number three wingman is out of position. -Signal him. -Shall I use the command radio, Colonel? Negative. We're still over enemy-occupied territory. Hey, the Hatchet Man's blinking at us, Eddie. Radioman, what's Colonel Brandon sayin' to us? MAN: [OVER RADIO] He says, our number three wingman is out of position, Captain Douglas. Archer. Damn! Why do I have to get stuck with all the boneheaded schoolboy replacements? You're over controlling the damn ship, Archer. I'm gonna take over, kid. The hell you are! Red Three from Red Leader. Close up. Red Three, this is Red Leader. Get that junk into formation! Red Leader, from Red Three, I hear you, Captain. Red flight, get off the air immediately. Resume radio silence. Pilot to Top Turret, keep your eye on that straggler. Report his position every five minutes. Bandits! Bandits! Where and how many? 3109, at 11 o'clock high, sir! There they are! There they are! Right down our throats! Look out! [MACHINE GUN FIRE] MAN: [OVER RADIO] I'm on it. Come on, you son of a bitch! Hey, I got me one hit! Hey, look, you guys! Lieutenant, Lieutenant! I see them, Albee! Do something! They're coming! Oh, God! Here comes a British Spitfire! -Eric... -What happened? The Spitfire got him. Creamed him on the first pass. [FIRING] The third Jerry chickened out. Yahoo! Well, I'll be damned! It's Archer, and he's got a Spitfire escort! Top Turret to Pilot, Lieutenant Archer's catching up, sir. Looks like he had some help. Top Turret, did you get the squadron markings on that Spitfire? No, sir. No, sir, I didn't, but he's corning back! Big Friend Leader from Little Friend, one of your lambs was set upon by wolves, or didn't you know? We knew. Thanks for your help, Little Red Riding Hood. Really, Commander, you ought to watch your flock a little more closely. I said, thanks. Now, move off my wing. Making you nervous, sir? Dear me! How's that? Comfy now? Waist Gunner, get a picture of that insolent bastard. Roger, Colonel. A splendid aircraft, the B-17. But you've no idea what lovely, huge targets they make, especially in daylight. Well, TTFN. Oh, that means, "Ta-ta for now." The minute we land, I want that film developed and that pilot identified. I'm logging a protest with the RAF. He saved one of our groups, sir. I'll mention it to his commanding officer. [PLANE WHIRRING] Have Wing Commander Howard report to me immediately when he lands. Seventeen, 18. The full group, Major. -[ALARM BLARING] -Wounded aboard. It's one of the new pilots. Lieutenant Archer. [SIREN WAILING] One of the Messerschmitts got it. Then a British Spitfire came out of nowhere. Knocked out one, chased the third. Those German fighters have guts. They were good. That crazy Spit saved us a lot of casualties. We took two wounded. One by flack, one by Jerry fighters. We couldn't even get in to him to help him. We just watched him, laying there, bleeding to death. You okay, Greg? -Where's Archer? -Hospital. Nothing serious, a few glass splinters in his scalp. The minute he's released, have him report to me. Sir? Could it wait till morning? He's pretty badly shaken up. Richman, if you want the chaplain's job, apply for it in a proper manner. He's all heart, that guy, all heart. You're only responsible for guessing the weather, Myron. You should've finish divinity school, Deacon! [KNOCKING ON DOOR] Come! Afternoon, Howard. Afternoon, groupie. You had us worried. Wireless not working? I thought it was. Didn't you get my report? No, we did not. However, the important thing is that you're back, and unscathed, apparently. Care for a spot? -Thank you. -Help yourself. How many Jerries you've got now, Howard? -Eighteen. -Any today? One, assuming it's confirmed. -Well, Bung-Ho. -Cheers. Uh, you consider yourself an experienced, skillful pilot, wise to all the enemies' tricks and tactics. Well, if I'm not, I doubt I ever will be. Good. I admire an officer who has confidence in what he knows. Look, if something's wrong... What makes you think something's wrong, Howard? Have you been up to some mischief you wanna get off your chest? No, nothing you'd care to hear about. I'm relieved to hear it. Because in spite of our past differences, I'd like your last fitness report to be a good one. -[COUGHING] -Your drink all right? -Oh, fine. Thank you. -Ah. You're leaving us, Howard. Leaving? Yes, leaving. Today. -May I ask where I'm being posted? -Bombers. But, I'm a fighter pilot! Yes, by your own modest admission, one of the best. That's why I chose you. And, you have a way with Americans, I'm told. Americans? Hmm. The 103rd Heavy Bombardment Group at Steeple Bassington, to be exact. -You'll fill them in on enemy fighter tactics. -But... You'll be interested to know that other RAF fighter pilots are being posted to American bomber groups. Sort of, uh, lend-lease in reverse. Oh, look, you can't do it! I've done it, Wing Commander Howard. Your orders. Oh, thank you. You know, a lot more will die before this ends. There was a time when you accepted that. I accepted the necessity. But watching them get knocked off day after day, I can't get used to that. Do they? No. No, they just get more scared and choked up. And nothing I do or say seems to make a damn bit of a difference. Be patient. You and Clay Richman. You'd have me warming their bottles. Mmm-hmm. [CHUCKLING] Planning to keep me waiting all day, Colonel Brandon? I'm sorry, General Palmer. I was just about to tell... You've been taking a lot of losses lately, Greg. Too many. German fighter pilots are getting better. So is their ack ack. Then you have to get better. General, I'll take any suggestions you have to offer. Cotten, I'm riding my flying crews as hard as I dare. They already think I'm a machine, dedicated to killing every one of 'em. It matters to you what they think? Yes, sir, it does. There's always the chance they may be right. I don't like that kind of talk, Colonel. Oh, isn't that my job? Taking them out, getting 'em killed? You better get a hold of yourself, Greg. Let Varga lead the next few missions. That's an order. If you think I'm cracking up, Cotten, why don't you just go ahead and relieve me? Oh, don't push me. We're old friends. It'd be simple to cut you down and pretend it was best for you and the service. But it happens, Colonel Brandon, that right now you may be the most essential commander in the Air Corps. Staff's agreed to listen to your plan. A 1000-plane raid over Germany in broad daylight. I thought that plan was buried, forgotten. Well, don't get your hopes up. It could be buried again. There's still a lot of opposition to long-range daylight bombing, especially from the British. Then why are they willing to listen? You'll know that this afternoon. You're coming to Pinetree with me. You'll present your entire plan. Rendezvous tables, in-flight defense strategy, bomber tactics, the works. And you damn well better be convincing. It's that important to the war effort. Get into your pinks while I'll have a look around your station. Everything all right, Greg? Greg? Everything is just handsome, Gabby. Now, your main opposition will come from Conway. He's just gotten another star. It made him a bit more cautious. But don't play to him directly. He knows all the conference-room tricks. And whatever they throw at you, Greg, for God's sake, keep cool. You'd make a rotten briefing officer, Cotten. You scare your men green. [SCOFFS] This is Colonel Greg Brandon, 103rd Bomb Group. Some of you know him already. I've known him since '34. We flew the mail together. He was a young Lieutenant with fresh ideas and strong opinions then. -He hasn't changed. -[AUDIENCE CHUCKLING] Colonel. With apologies to the British officers present, reconnaissance photographs show that on their nighttime bombing efforts, not one bomb in five fell within miles of its target. Now, look here. Now, I don't mean to downgrade the British contribution to the air war. You pioneered most of the combat techniques in use today. But, gentlemen, the Luftwaffe couldn't terrorize London into submission. What makes us think the same tactics will make the Germans quit? Get to your point, please, Colonel. It's just this, General Conway. Hit one of Germany's most important industrial targets. A massive daylight assault, a precision attack. Destroy it totally. To mount such an attack, will require every B-17 in England. To be exact, gentlemen, 1,000 planes. [AUDIENCE MURMURING] I know your plan, Brandon. Now, let's hear you defend it. I'll try, sir. Colonel, are you aware that the Luftwaffe is getting stronger every day? I've good reason to know that, sir. And you still suggest that we commit our entire frontline strength in one raid? Without the cover of darkness, 1000 planes would be a massive target for the Luftwaffe! We'll take losses, yes, sir. It would be mass suicide! And if Hitler launches his invasion across the Channel, your scheme could leave us helpless to stop him. I wonder if the Colonel realizes that the losses he wants us to risk could very well be the turning point in this war. Our casualties will be high, yes, sir. But if we're successful, it'll mean fewer men and planes lost in the future. We haven't enough anti-submarine bombers as it is, Colonel. Let up on the enemy's submarine pens, and his wolf packs will strangle this island. [ALL MURMURING AGREEMENT] We need bombers in the Pacific Theater also, Admiral. I hear Japan needs plastering badly. You find that fact amusing, Colonel? What I'm trying to say, sir, we'll never have enough bombers, or pilots to fly 'em. Not till the day this war is over. [ALL MURMURING AGREEMENT] General Palmer says you have this scheme of yours all worked out. All right. Let's hear it. Yes, sir. The only elements missing from these plans are the two you gentlemen must supply. The date of the raid and the target. A strike of this magnitude will require a minimum of 30 fully operational airfields. Plus an additional 30 airfields for the required British fighter support. [PEOPLE SHOUTING AND LAUGHING INDISTINCTLY] This is it. Get it, pal. Oh, he did it! Hey, the winner and our new champion here! [INDISTINCT CHATTER CONTINUES] -Oh, yes, sir? -Good evening. I'd like a pink gin and a nice, quiet room. I'm sorry. No rooms. I'll bet yours is nice and cozy. My husband thinks so. Did you ever have a day when all your luck was rotten? Honestly, I'm not hiding a girl in my kit bag, if that's what's worrying you. It's simply that I don't want to report to my new station before I've absolutely got to. Steeple Bassington. -That's a Yank air base. -That's right. I've been exiled by a jealous group commander. And simply because I was winning the air war singlehanded. [LAUGHING] Oh, all right. Upstairs, end of the hall. And mind your loose tongue. Those are your new mates. Confusion to our enemies, gentlemen. Particularly and primarily, to the Hatchet Man, to Brandon. Harvey, you have to drink to that. The Colonel is certainly no enemy of yours. DOUGLAS: All right, all right, leave the kid alone, Al. QUIMBY: What'd I say? What'd I say? You are disloyal, Quimby, and you are no gentleman. Now, personally, I purely admire a commanding officer who doesn't give a hoot in hell for the welfare of his men. QUIMBY: Yeah, well, the colonel stinks! I'll drink to that. No, not so fast, Quimby. It is ungentlemanly for an officer to guzzle his brew. Now, gentlemen, by the numbers. And a one, two, three and down! Ah! Let's do it again. Finish it off. One, and a two! -All the way down. -DOUGLAS: Three... [BOTH LAUGHING] Estimated bomb tonnage needed, 3500 tons. Total fuel, 1,850,000 gallons, minimum. Fifty-caliber ammunition, five million rounds. Oxygen... We'll study your logistics later, Colonel. Right now, I'd like to know how you plan to move 1000 planes over a small target without taking half a day to do it. Instead of a single aiming point, General, there'll be three. Three waves coming in on three separate approach routes at staggered altitudes. Time spread over the target, maximum 60 minutes. What about collision risk? BRANDON: At rendezvous, collisions due to pilot error will cost us 1% of our force. Navigational error, one-half of 1%. Over the target, with enemy ack-ack and fighter attacks, it's hard to tell. With staggered altitudes, what about the danger of the low waves running into your own bombs from above? If each wave crosses the target exactly on schedule, the risk would be infinitesimal. We're bound to have early crossings and late crossings. -And more losses. -[ALL MURMURING AGREEMENT] BRANDON: Gentlemen, gentlemen! This schedule is only a reference, not a bible. The strike commander will have to keep things sorted out over the target. That's a fearful responsibility, Colonel. Yes, sir, it is. Would you be prepared to take that responsibility? All right, leave your charts here, Colonel. Thank you for coming. Why didn't you answer Conway? You know the old army rule, Cotten. "Never volunteer for anything." Have you lost confidence in your plan? Is there a flaw in it somewhere? No. Good. Because what I'm about to tell you is top secret. Now, the Focke-Wulf fighter planes are made here. Marstenberg. Intelligence says that the enemy is preparing to disperse those factories to a half dozen different locations across Germany. We have got to destroy those plants before they can be scattered. Marstenberg? Well, it's too far. And too heavily fortified. You might as well send us to Berlin. Staff wants Marstenberg. They have a couple of other plans they'll hassle and stew over for a while. That's their job. But in the end, they'll decide on a single knockout punch. Then you don't believe they have another choice? I wish they had, Greg. Your plan scares the hell out of me. Thanks for the lift, lad. You broke the defense integrity of this squadron. You made a virtually helpless target out of your plane and your crew. Colonel, I admit I acted in panic but it won't happen again, sir. That's not good enough, Lieutenant. Oh, I beg your pardon, Colonel. I'll wait outside till you're finished. You're new to this group, Lieutenant. So just this once I'm going to listen to your excuse. It was an involuntary action, sir. I saw those enemy fighters coming straight... And you panicked! Hello! Uh, I wouldn't go in there, if I were you. Your CO is tearing a strip off some defenseless little Lieutenant. Is he always so iron-tailed? I'm sorry. We haven't been introduced, have we? Trafton Howard. My friends call me Traf. Wing Commander, Royal Air Force. Or I was until yesterday, when I got sentenced to this nursery school. There's no telling what further punishment old Hardwicke is going to surprise me with. Demote me, probably. I say, you're not very talkative, are you? You haven't stopped long enough to give me a chance. Confidentially, it's a tactic, designed to keep your attention while you recover from what is undoubtedly a remarkably bad first impression of me. You, uh, do take some getting used to. Marvelous! Truth and beauty, a rare combination! I didn't catch your name, love. -Lieutenant Ames, sir. -Lieutenant Ames. Imagine parents who'd choose a first name like "Lieutenant" for a pretty girl. I guess they knew a war was coming. Seriously, military titles must only be used to cadge drinks from civilians. Now, what's your first name? I'm bound to find out from somebody. [DOOR OPENING] Poor chap. I know exactly what he's going through. Getting ticked off is practically a daily ritual for me. Uh, wait for me! Excuse me, sir. Lieutenant Richman said you wanted to look at these photographs. Thank you, Gabby. This is Wing Commander Howard, Colonel Brandon. I hope I didn't put you off your stroke, barging in while you were ripping the tail off that lieutenant. Excuse me, sir. You should've seen her face when he came out. Motherly type, no doubt about it. Uh, tell me, is she somebody's personal preserve, or can anybody have a go? Your orders, Wing Commander. You've been briefed? I've been told only that I'm supposed to familiarize your group with enemy fighter tactics. Planning some sort of show, Colonel? Something big, no doubt. You Americans have a fondness for things that are big. You'll be told when you need to know. Fair enough. Reporting for duty, sir. Well, you can start by getting me the name of one of your associates. A Royal Air Force pilot? I intend to lodge a complaint. What on earth for? Insolence, stupid reckless insol..." I think it's really rather good of me, don't you? Report to my office in 10 minutes, Wing Commander. BRANDON: He probably doesn't know a thing -about enemy fighter tactics. -Colonel Brandon. -Nothing but a reckless pilot. -Colonel Brandon! If you'd permit me, I dare say Wing Commander Howard knows more about enemy fighter tactics than the combined allied chiefs. I think you'll find that his irritating attitude is a small price to pay for such a knowledgeable officer. Thank you. Wing Commander Howard out there? GABRIELLE: Yes, sir. Send him in. Check with Lieutenant Ames. She'll assign you quarters and once you're checked in, we'll discuss your new duties. Something wrong, Wing Commander? Uh, nothing, Colonel. I just thought my luck had finally changed. Shall we try for a new start, Howard? That's very sporting of you, Colonel Brandon, I'm sure. [WHISTLE BLOWING] All right, hit it! Up and at 'em, you heroes! Up! Up! Briefing at 0500! Everybody! Full flying gear! Flying gear! What the hell for? For fly inspection! What'd you think? [SCREAMING] Hup, hup, you mother hupper! Shut the door. It's freezing in here! Knock it off! Close the door! It's freezing in here! Hey, when you get there, tell'em I'll be late. Oh. Where are my shorts? Ten-hut! Be seated. I'll make this short. After the last mission, you all must realize how miserably sloppy you were. Had the primary target been clear, a lot more than three enemy fighters would have jumped us. And a lot of you wouldn't be here now. A simple fact, gentlemen, the Germans are out-flying us. Oh, I know what you're thinking. Every bomber group takes its losses, and 103rd is no exception. Well, I intend it to be an exception, gentlemen. After the last mission, it's obvious that, uh, pep talks don't inspire you. What you need is more training. You'll start with the basics, and go straight through the manual. Major Varga will be in charge of your re-education, and it will continue until I am completely sure that you can handle any combat situation. As a personal matter, gentlemen, I take no pleasure in having to reteach you something you should have already learned. But learn it you will. [ALARM BLARING] Crew from Pilot, bail out. Tail Gunner, bailing out! Left Waist, bailing out. Right Waist, out. Hey! Hey. How'd you miserable foul-ups do, huh? Well, no matter what this crew did, it wouldn't be good enough. Ah, don't let it bug you. Our time wasn't much better. I'll never be able to please that bastard! "Who is the happy warrior? Who is he "That every man in arms would wish to be?" You poor, abused colonials! Knock it off, you guys. If you've got the inside track, Howard, when's Brandon going to let up? Our leader hasn't seen fit to enlighten me. Until he does, your guess is as good as mine. Come on, Doug, let's have a pint. Worchek, come on. How many ships can we get in the air tomorrow, Kruger? The full group, sir, except this bird. If you can't do the job, Sergeant. Sir, she's got more lice in her than a blind chicken. I get the engines all fixed and the controls go sour. I get the controls all fixed, and the hydraulic system... Kruger! Yes, sir? Whatever it takes, get that ship operational. Okay? I'll do my best, Colonel. What's the matter now? Elevator's acting funny. Trim it. Well, do something! We're losing altitude. Nothing seems to work! Abort. Abort! Rainbow Leader, this is Red Three. Having control trouble. Do you read me? Having control trouble. Permission to return to base. VARGA: Rainbow Leader to Red Three, permission granted. Sergeant Kruger. Yes, sir. Lieutenant Archer's aborting. The minute he lands, I want you to check his controls and report to me. Yes, sir. De-briefing reports on yesterday's mission. Question to Blue Leader Navigator. Why'd you miss the IP by a full two minutes? Question to Green Three Leader. Why did your squadron fall behind over the target? -Question to Red Leader, Captain Douglas? -Yes, sir. The Air Corps provides hand extinguishers for cockpit fires, not flying jackets or blankets. I could go on, but you all know where you were sloppy and where you were negligent. Oh, you found the target. You even did some damage to it. But don't expect any congratulations. You were barely adequate. -Major? -Attention! Kruger? Yes, sir! I've been waiting for that report. Well, I wanted to recheck Lieutenant Archer's controls, sir. Well? There's nothing wrong with 'em. [JAZZ MUSIC PLAYING] Harvey, stop it! We're not even supposed to be dancing here. Oh, stop. You're hurting me even! Come on, Harvey. Come on, you're drunk! Yeah, but I'm out from under. No more gut aches for me. I'm free! Come on, let's go back to the base. No! No. I don't wanna go back to the base because I'm not going to be flying tomorrow. Or any other day, not ever again, not anywhere, not ever! Because I've been grounded, Deacon. Yes, siree! The Hatchet Man has clipped my wings and plucked out my tail feathers just for good measure. Hate him. Oh, God. I hate him. Hate him! [SOBBING] QUIMBY: Archer's had it this time. DOUGLAS: Well, Quimby, I guess that means you'll be flying Archer's plane. QUIMBY: Oh, hell. Let's have a drink to Archer. Yes, I'm riding Archer. He's a miserable pilot and a menace to his crew. You're destroying him. He's expendable! Everything I say or do to him makes an impression on the other pilots and crews. If they learn through his mistakes, at least he's served some purpose. Greg, what's happened to you? Just thinking what's ahead for a hell of a lot of men. Well, whatever it is, if you keep this up, they're not going to follow you. Gabby, I can't let up on 'em! I can't tell them what they're facing. I can't even tell you. You've told me. In the one way that counts. You haven't really looked at me for weeks. [SIGHING] I'm sorry. I just... It's just that we had something wonderful. [SIGHING] Maybe when this is over. Now is when you need me, Greg. I love you. I asked you to meet me here because of security, Greg. Is it on? Only Varga and that British liaison are cleared to know about this. Is it on, Cotten? Yes. They bought your 1000 plan. I've been given overall command, you'll be Strike Commander. Greg, if we can bring this off... I thought you'd be jumping out from under your hat. Do you realize what a success will do for the war effort? What's eating you? This is your brainchild. You sold me. You sold staff. Now you want out, is that it? There was a time when I was sure I wanted to lead 1000 planes. Greg, I need you on this raid. Nobody understands your bombing strategy as well as you do. Varga could. No. Like it or not, you're the key to our success. I don't like it. Are you sick, Greg? No, no. Are you refusing to accept the responsibility? It seems my men underestimated me. They didn't know how fast I could kill 'em off if I had a chance. Are you refusing? When do we hit Marstenberg? On the 19th. That's less than three weeks. Now, how the hell are you gonna get 1000 planes assembled, fitted, fueled, armed and ready to go in less than three weeks? By telescoping your time table, Colonel. No comment, Colonel. Even off the record? You don't want to hear it, believe me. The bars are down. Let's hear it, Traf. All right. It's murder. Deliberate, coldblooded... Criminal. I told the Colonel you wouldn't be too keen about his idea. Well, what sort of a reaction did he expect to a plan that's so desperate? The Royal Air Force has been to Marstenberg twice. Our losses were enormous! We know the history of British nighttime bombing. Well, then, if you've learned anything from it, at least make your raid a night operation! The decision's been made. A precision bombing attack in daylight, on a strategic target with 1000 planes. That's too big! You'll have no element of surprise. The Germans will get suspicious the minute you stop your regular bombing runs! We're not stopping our regular bombing runs. Why do you bother to tell me all this? Because you were sent here to teach my crews fighter defense. And I want your best guess on what fighter tactics the Luftwaffe will send at us. They'll come at you head on in waves of a dozen or more. Because that's where your airplane is the most vulnerable and the Germans damn well know it. Brandon, you can still stop this lunacy! As British liaison officer here, you're not required to accompany us on this mission, Wing Commander. Colonel, I'm going to wave goodbye to you from the ground. Take it easy, Traf. Well, taking risks is my business! But there's a hell of a difference between a calculated risk and certain disaster! Certainly doesn't pull his punches, does he? We asked for his opinion. More ordnance stuff, I'll bet. Well, you know what I think? I think somebody's flipped. I think the whole lousy quartermaster corps is dumping all their junk on us. No, it's the same at every airfield. One of the truck drivers told me. What do ya suppose it means? It means we gotta fatten you little piggies up before we send you over to Schicklgruber's market. -Now, get movin', soldiers. Come on! -Oh, oh, oh. Move it over there! Move it over there! Anyone at home? Hello, is the CO in? Colonel Brandon's on his way to Pinetree again today. I can reach him if it's important, Wing Commander. No. Let's not disturb our leader while he's at the summit. When, uh... When do you expect him back? Oh, tonight. Late, probably. Why? Wakey, wakey! Rise and shine, you tosspot. Get out of here. And not before you explain this. Your request for transfer, Lieutenant. How'd you get that? I must admit, it's one way of squeezing out of a cowardice charge. What should I do, hold still while Brandon hangs me? Just between us, was there really anything the matter with your controls the other day? Yes. At least, I mean, I... I thought so. You mean, you're not certain? Well, you're such a fireball. What do you do when you're a jinxed pilot? You can't be a jinxed pilot, Archer. Because you're not even a pilot. I'm as good as any man in this outfit. Would you care to prove that to me? How can I? I've been grounded. You Yanks! Always letting protocol stand in your way! There are bags of airplanes out there. Come on, let's borrow one! -Sergeant! -Sir! Who authorized that flight? I don't know, sir. They just took it. Who? Wing Commander Howard and Lieutenant Archer. [INDISTINCT RADIO CONVERSATION] [RADIO STOPS] Airplanes are a lot like women. They have to be handled very gently. Never correct too much. Let go. Let me have her. I've flown smaller aircrafts that weren't as maneuverable as this. Shall we see what she's really got? Jacoby, hand me that mike. Aircraft 85 from Control Tower, 85 from Control, do you read me? No, you damn fool, land! Land that plane. No use. He must've switched off the radio. Never mind. It's too late. It's about to hit the fan. Wait till he finds out it's his plane. Now, would you mind telling me what the devil you were afraid of? Hello, Colonel. I thought you were on your way somewhere. I saw that plane being stunted. Lieutenant Archer... You're restricted to quarters, pending a court martial for insubordination. Colonel! Colonel, if there was any insubordination, it was on my part and quite unintentional. Lieutenant Archer was my guest, so to speak. Your guest, Wing Commander, in my plane? Did you bother to remember that strike is less than a week away? No, I hadn't forgotten... And at a time when we need every plane that can... Colonel, what good are planes without men to fly them? I took up a scared washout and I brought back a pilot and a man. Isn't that what you need most, qualified pilots? If Archer were the last pilot on earth, I wouldn't let him fly again. Sir, about that parts list I gave you the other day... No parts available, Kruger. With respect, Colonel, just how am I supposed to keep this group up in the air? -You'll manage. -How? Every mission, they come back chewed up worse than before! There's no parts to be had, Kruger. Why? Why, all of a sudden, is everything I need out of supply? Are you finished, Sergeant? No, sir. Will the Colonel kindly tell me how I'm supposed to keep this group flying? All right. Cannibalize the Can Do. Strip everything you need out of her for the other aircraft. Birdie, I'm gonna pluck out your lousy feathers. [ALL CHUCKLING] Hey, what the hell is Brandon up to, Howard? Now, we've pulled eight missions without a foul-up. Now why is he still pushin' so hard? Because you need it. Listen, I think if the crud's starting to hit the wall, we got a right to know about it. Yeah, well, I know. The Hatchet Man's figured a way to totally demoralize the Luftwaffe. Yeah? How? By chopping off Hermann Goering's... -Oh, get lost. -[ALL DISAGREEING] I hear the ordinance section's preparing storage for 50 tons of incendiaries. MAN: Fifty? JACOBY: Fifty, count'em. I'd be very careful of that kind of loose talk if I were you, Jacoby. We have problems, gentlemen, in every phase of our preparations for Marstenberg. But there's one thing that stops us cold. Our losses on regular missions are going up, every day. The Luftwaffe's getting sharper. They're penetrating our formations head-on, almost at will. Does that mean you won't be able to put up 1000 planes for the big show, sir? No. It means that I can't accept the kind of losses that we can predict. Sir, Colonel Brandon and I have been working on something that just might make the difference. Greg? BRANDON: I want two ships in each squadron altered according to these specs. They'll carry extra guns and ammo. But sir, you... You're sacrificing their bomb load. That's right. The bomb load will vary from light to zero. The gun ships will be strategically located in each squadron. A flying gunship? Destroyer escort principle. We hope to discourage head-on fighter attacks. Any comments, Wing Commander? I think that ought to give them a very nasty surprise. What were your orders, Sergeant? To have the full group operational by the 19th, sir. That's the day after tomorrow. Yes, sir. If the Germans didn't chew us up so fast, I might keep ahead. With respect, Colonel, if the 19th is so important, we should have had a stand-down on that last mission. You're not my advisor, Sergeant. When you can handle your own job, I'll consider promoting you. Until then, keep your opinions to yourself. [WHISPERS] Yes, sir. Just get those ships ready. I'll try. BRANDON: That's not good enough! Do we understand each other, Sergeant? Yes, sir. He's the best maintenance chief in the Air Corps. Don't you think you rode him a bit hard? He had his orders. Kruger's one of the very few men left in this outfit who's on your side. I'm glad to know that, Lieutenant. Is there anything else, Lieutenant? Yes, sir. Colonel. You're a son of a bitch. Sir. [ENGINE STARTING] Well, I guess I never really believed they'd order it. Order a standby alert, Major. Restrict all personnel to base. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] MAN: [ON RADIO] Germany calling. Germany calling. This is Lord Haw-haw. I have some very disturbing news for you flyers of the American Heavy Bombardment Forces. While I'm speaking to you, the telegraph writers are grinding out your orders for tomorrow. It's a big one, gentlemen. The strike you've all been trained so hard for. You're going to take part in an experiment. A 1000-plane raid. Sounds full of glory, doesn't it? But what your officers won't tell you until the last moment tomorrow morning is your target. Of course, I could reveal it. But that would spoil the surprise and disappoint the Luftwaffe who are looking forward to the chance of shooting so many of you down. By the way, you men of the 103rd will be especially interested in this item. The author of this suicidal raid is your own commanding officer. What a pity none of you will be around to see him wearing the new star of a Brigadier General. But at least you will have the satisfaction of knowing you bought it for him with your lives. I repeat, gentlemen, with your lives. This is Radio Berlin returning you to our regular broadcast of music. [MUSIC PLAYING ON RADIO] Of course I heard him! An operation of this magnitude is almost certain to spring a security leak. Well, if they know that much about the plan, they must know the target. If Lord Haw-haw knew, he'd have named it. Berlin's bluffing. Can we afford the risk? This is a hell of a time to be talking about risks. Your plan's a bloody juggernaut, Colonel. It's too big. It's moving too fast to be stopped by a little detail like a breach of security. Then it's set? The 103rd leads the show tomorrow. Varga's your deputy strike commander. Wish us luck. I'm praying for more than that. So Brandon turns out to be the Judas goat, leading us to slaughter. Hey, Deacon, you're his buddy. Tell us why? I don't know. Traf, you must've known about this all along. We British have been listening to Haw-haw's muck for some time. We've learned to pay no attention to him. [ALL CHEERING] Major, we have work to do tomorrow. Close this place down. Gabby... Whatever I've done, I never meant to hurt you. I... Please, don't say any more. I'm here. [SIGHING] There's so much pain everywhere. Maybe we can shut it out for a little while. Gabby? Hmm? This'll be the worst raid we've ever had. [SIGHING] Will it be that bad? Yep. Knowing that, why didn't you try to stop the raid? Did you ever try stopping a nightmare once it starts? But if you don't believe in your plan anymore... That's the hell of it, Gabby. I do believe in it. [SIGHING] Sooner or later, we have to go to Marstenberg. But it's too soon and too far. At the briefing tomorrow, how do I face 'em? Oh, Greg, don't. Don't. [INDISTINCT CONVERSATION] Our target, gentlemen, Marstenberg, where their fighters are built. We're going to smash this facility with one massive blow. [ALL MURMURING] Pilots, navigators and bombardiers will stay behind for special briefing. The rest of you are dismissed. VARGA: Ten-hut! Good luck. MAN: [OVER RADIO] 392nd off from Ridgewell, 36 aircraft. MAN 2: 351st off from Great Ashfield. 28 aircraft. MAN 3: 100th, off from Thorpe Abbotts, 32 aircraft. MAN 1: 402nd, off from Kimbolton, 34 aircrafts. [METAL CLANKING] Pilot to Crew, crash landing! [ALARM BLARING] [SIRENS WAILING] Pilot to Tail, anybody get out of that crash? TAIL GUNNER: Hard to tell. But it looks like some of them did. Are you all right? I'm all right. Any other aborts? -No, sir. -What happened, Colonel? Looked like control trouble, Greg. If you hadn't been stunting that ship, I'd still be in the air. I'm prepared to answer for that. Well, I'm going to make damn certain you do! Fine! But in the meantime, if you want to catch up with your men, I suggest you get cracking! What the hell are you talking about? Every B-17 in England is in that raid! Correction, Colonel. Everyone but the Can Do. MAN 1: 103rd off from Steeple, Bassington, 34 aircraft. One abort. MAN 2: 391st, off from Polbrook, 36 aircraft. MAN 1: 384, off from Batten, 29 aircraft. General, Colonel Brandon crashed on takeoff. MAN 2: 92nd, off from... But she'll still fly, won't she, Sergeant? Yes, sir, but she's been gutted. No backup system, no bomb racks. Only her waist guns left. Excellent. The less weight, the faster we go. We? Well, you'll need somebody to drive the bus while you direct the traffic over the target. You'll need a copilot. And there's only me or Harvey Archer available. Forget it, sir. You haven't got a crew! And someone has to man those waist guns! Get in some flight gear, Kruger. Yes, sir. I said I'd never let Archer fly again. But if it's a choice between you or him... Captain. MAN 1: The yellow force has crossed the French coast. No German fighters as yet. MAN 2: The Blue Force has completed rendezvous over the North Sea and is heading for its approach... Rendezvous is right on the nose, sir. We had four collisions, about what Colonel Brandon estimated. Is he all right? Yes, sir. I've sent word for him to get right over here. Here's your intercept course, skipper. Well, I'm really quite a capable navigator. I think you can trust me to get you there, all right? I thought you said this mission was a suicide raid. Ah, yes! But that's no reason to miss all the fun, is it? MAN 1: And the Red Force is approaching the coast of... British fighter cover joined the armada precisely as scheduled, sir. It's a pity we haven't the flying range to cover the entire show. Daylight Leader, this is Brandon. Daylight Leader, acknowledge. Where are ya, Colonel? Closing from behind. Will resume command. -Worchek! -What? It's Brandon! Talk about damn fool guts. He's flying a skeleton. MAN 1: Fighter cover at maximum range. Breaking off to refuel. [EXPLOSIONS] Flack stopped. Watch out for Jerry fighters. Course correction, skipper. Bandits! Bandits! It's the whole damn Luftwaffe, Colonel! It's Varga's plane. Jump, you guys, jump! MAN 1: Breaking at 11:00! Breaking at 11:00! MAN 2: I got him. MAN 1: He's coming around underneath at 10 o'clock! [SCREAMING] MAN 2: I don't see him. MAN 1: 2 o'clock. Watch him, Scotty. I've got him in my sights. [SCREAMING] -Oh, God! Take over, Worchek! -I got it. Get him out of here! Daylight One, this is Daylight Leader, IP. Start your bomb run. Make it good. Pilot to Bombardier, PDI centered. She's all yours. BOMBARDIER: Target clear. Bombs away. [EXPLOSIONS] [CACKLING] Right down their throats, Colonel! Spit that up, you bums! Hey, look at that smoke! Oh, bloody good show, sir! MAN: The first wave has dropped on time. Results, excellent. -Splendid. -Congratulations. MAN: Second wave is six minutes late. Third wave coming in nine minutes early. Daylight Leader to Daylight Red Leader, you're off schedule. Move in. Daylight Blue Leader, turn to new course, 150 and hold. Acknowledge. RED LEADER: Daylight Red Leader, roger. BLUE LEADER: Daylight Blue Leader, roger. MAN: The second wave has dropped. Results are good to excellent. -We've done it! -[ALL CHEERING] -Isn't that marvelous? -Splendid. Brandon got them sorted out, General. KRUGER: Colonel! Archer, give them a hand. Kruger? Kruger? Howard's been wounded. Kruger's dead. Get Howard into a chute. You jump with him. Sir, in your hell hot hurry to leave, we forgot our chutes. Ship's losing altitude, fast. The Colonel's been hit and he's going down. Watch for chutes. Watch for parachutes. Come on, pull it out. Pull it out. MAN: The third wave is coming over the target. MAN: Gentlemen, gentlemen, we have a final strike report. Target totally destroyed. Signed, Greystone. Now commanding. Greystone? Second deputy. Nobody got out of Major Varga's plane. Nobody! I don't know about the Colonel... I... He just started to go down. I...didn't see him hit. We've been trying to raise him on the radio. No answer. The debriefing officers will be waiting, gentlemen. Let 'em wait. Lieutenant, you were given an order... Captain? May I borrow your glasses? Yes, sir. That's the Channel down there, Colonel. [METAL CLANKING] I'm takin' over, sir. Take your hands off, Archer. We got about seven minutes worth of fuel. And you're off course, Colonel. Right now, I could fly circles around you. Don't you let up on me, Brandon. Not even for a second! Oh, you bring this ship in even if it kills us. Brandon! [ALARM BLARING] You're 50 feet too low, Colonel. Lower the landing gear. They're jammed. Circle. I'll hand crank 'em down. That cuts it. The landing gear is shot to hell. You'll have to belly-land on the first pass, Colonel, because you got about zero fuel left. You'll never hit the runway! I can land this ship! One lesson from Howard and you're a flyer! Well, there's one quick way to find out, Colonel. [SIRENS WAILING] I'm okay. Get Howard. -You all right, Brandon? -Yeah. Excuse me. Coming through, please. Excuse me. -All right, Greg? -How'd we do, sir? Well, you were all wrong about your 1000-plane raid, Colonel. Thank God our losses fell far short of your predictions. Target completely demolished. MAN 1: We did it, we did it! MAN 2: We made it! And just what the hell are you guys gawking at? Come on, the debriefing officers are waiting for us. Come on. After you, Colonel.
