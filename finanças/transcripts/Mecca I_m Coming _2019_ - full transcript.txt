What is it? It's okay. It's fine. - Oh, Allah - Fasting and hajj... - Look, Haji Soleh has returned! - As we are holding this event... ...to welcome back Haji Soleh. Glad and happy to become "Haji" and "Hajjah" Welcome, Haji Soleh May your hajji be accepted by God Eddy! Get out of the way! Get out of the way! God is the greatest! Eddy! God is the greatest! Help! Get out of the way! One year later Almost one year later Wait a second. Be patient. Oh, my gosh. It's fine. If you're soulmates, she'll be with you. - Did your car break down, mister? - No. We're all... ...having a picnic. Your car broke down. See? I'm right. So, what are we going to do? Be patient! Relax, mister. - I'm a professional mechanic. - Yes. If I see something like this, my instincts come out immediately. - Yes. - Where are the pliers? - Scissors. - Scissors. - Tape. - Tape. This is what I like about Mrs. Hajjah's biscuits. - It's so good, right, miss? - Yes, miss! It's so good! It's so good, right? Thank you. I also need to go right now. Why are you in such a rush? I still have some orders for the biscuits. I need to deliver it to the neighboring village. - Yes. - I'll be going. Be careful, Mrs. Hajjah. Oh, my. Be careful on the road. Mrs. Hajjah, you're my idol. - There. It's done. - Will the car start now? - Of course it will. - Get in. - Yeah. - Okay, let's go. Next week, I want to order catering for my husband's birthday. When I like something, I'll stick to it. I'm loyal. Yeah. Thank you, mister. Let's go. Yes, the wedding is on! Oh, my God. What happened? - It broke down again! - What happened? Oh, my God! Haji Soleh's Salted Eggs We take orders Dad. Stop playing the PlayStation! Wait. I'm starting a new field. He's already old, but he plays like a little kid. My daughter. This isn't a game for little kids. This game teaches us to be good in time management. I thought you weren't able to listen... ...to the voice of your daughter's heart anymore, Dad. See? I failed to do the harvest again. - Got, me first! - Me first! - Got, me first! - No! Me first! - Why are you being so stubborn? - Income book Repair Shop It's definitely crowded It's Mrs. Hajjah! - What happened? - It's Mrs. Hajjah! Over here. Thank God. - Peace be upon you. - Hey! Where are you going? I'm going to deliver Mrs. Ramah's order. Tell Mrs. Ramah who's not that friendly, "If you ordered eggs,... ...come here yourself. Take it yourself." Tell her that. She's a customer, Dad. We have to give good services, right? "Customer"? Oh, please. Just say that you want to meet that damn jerk. A car exploded. Was it because of you? You don't deserve to open a repair shop. You have employees but they're playing around. But if I don't open a repair shop, what will I do? Open a store, sell prayer rugs and hijab. Oh, my gosh, Mom. A man selling hijab? His name is Eddy Arrasyid. Eddy Arrasyid the damn jerk. - Dad! - Eni! He caused trouble to all the residents here. It's true that Eddy doesn't do his job right. - But he's a good man! - There's a man better than Eddy! That's right! Mr. Pardijon. - How did you get here? - Now, that's it. This is what's called a good customer. He ordered the eggs and came here himself. Playing the PlayStation by himself. - Here, your eggs. - Dad! What's with you, Eni? Go on inside! - She does that when she's angry. - Relax, Mom. A blessing will come one day, Mom. There it is! A blessing has come! Mr. Tekun. Your car broke down, right? What do you mean "broke down"? I'm just exercising! See? Tomorrow, the boss will come here at 8 o'clock. This arranged marriage has to work out, right? - Of course it has to! Of course. - Don't let it be cancelled. You know what will happen if it's cancelled. The sign in front of your house, your eggs,... ...and everything in this house, you could lose them all, sir! This isn't a threat. - But why do I feel threatened? - No. But the point is,... ...tomorrow, everything will already be taken care of. There we go! It's great to hear that! - Okay, then. I'll be leaving. - Wait a second. You have your own eggs. So why are you taking other people's eggs? I thought that was mine. Send my regards to Pietoyo. Hey! Say his full name, sir. Boss Soon-to-be Haji Pietoyo Jarwokuncoro. Boss Soon-to-be Haji Pietoyo Jarwokursumo. - Kuncoro! - Kuncoro! There we go! Now that sounds good to hear. - Peace be upon you too. - Hey. Say the complete thing. Eni. Huh? Eni! Daughter, open the door! Listen... - Eni, don't close it! Listen to me! - No! I don't want to risk my future with Pietoyo! Hey! Don't speak carelessly! There's meaning in the name of "Pietoyo". "Pie" means "manly". "To" means "protecting". "Yo" means "to be trusted". The point is, no! You're so stubborn! I'm telling you. A proposal is like a fit and proper test. If that damn jerk of yours isn't proper and fit,... ...you have to gladly accept your dad's decisions. It's like that! Fine! I'm just going to leave. Your touch has missed twenty times. Just like your life! You always miss. Don't compare me to you, Mom. You were already skilled even before I was born. Too many excuses. Just like your dad. But he made accurate life decisions. Accurate! Back then, during the hard times, your dad only had one motorcycle... ...as his life investment. In the end, your dad's motorcycle was sold. For what? To go on hajj. - Was the money even enough, Mom? - No, it wasn't enough. But your dad joined the lottery for hajj. He sent coupons. He didn't send just one. He sent a thousand. That's not being accurate, Mom. - That's being dumb! - Hey! Don't speak nonsense. Being accurate is buying one and getting the prize right away. Because he got one coupon right, your dad and I could go on hajj. I changed. Now that's what we call "accurate". How is that accurate, Mom? Hajj, Ed! Hajj! Death can come anytime, anywhere. Dad died in the Mina Tunnel incident. If God's willing, he died in the name of God. My leg became crooked. But I accepted it. And I want you to change too. Do you understand? What was that? A cat, Mom. I thought a motorcycle just crashed. - So, change is... - Is your phone dead, Eddy? Thirty-three missed calls! Mrs. Hajjah. Are you here to deliver my order? Yes, Mrs. Hajjah. But... Eddy, do you still love me? Of course I do. If you still love me,... ...tomorrow, you have to marry me! It cracked! Why are you in such a rush? I'm being set up for an arranged marriage with someone else! This motorcycle is awesome! Oh, my gosh. Then, what should I do now? It's so fast! - Awesome! - Mom! Mom! Tomorrow is the only time you have left, Eddy. You have to convince my dad. Please, have some snacks. What do you think? It's a guarantee for happiness, sir. I'm sure 1,000 percent that Pietoyo is definitely... - Oh, my gosh. That was a mighty whiff. - Right? What do you think, Mr. Haji? As for me, I believe... ...that Pietoyo can make my kid happy. - His name is "Pietoyo", after all. - Pietoyo. "Pie" means "a blessing". "To" means "smoothly". "Yo" means... Clogged. Why are there five cups? Who's the other cup for? Someone. And then? Where are you going? Hey. Please understand. My kid is part off the "implusive millennials" generation. - You mean "impulsive millennials", sir. - That's it. - Wait a second. - Sure. What do you think? Yeah. Right, right, right. Listen, Mr. Haji Soleh. According to Boss Pietoyo's opinion,... ...it's fine that Eni is acting that way. - It's understandable. - Then that means... ...that they're right for each other! They are! Hey! Damn jerk! Don't turn off your motorcycle. And put up the kick stand again. Turn around right away. Hurry up! Come on, what are you waiting for? Hey! Eni! What are you doing? Eni! Here he is, Dad. The guest that I mentioned before. Wait. We already discussed the date, day, and time. We already agreed on it. So it's definitely going to happen, right? Yes, you're right. That's how it is. What do you mean "that's how it is"? As long as the day, date, and time is part of my future,... ...it has to be with my consent. What? Why is it like that? What? You said it yourself, Dad. The agenda for today is just the fit and proper test. So, my potential fiance, who are Pietoyo and Eddy... ...have to pass the fit and proper test first. Wait, wait. Wait a second, sir. Am I the one who got it wrong or it seems like... Why is it... - Another sign. - Yes. Okay. According to the signs of Boss Pietoyo's cough... - Yes? - He is ready... ...to have the fit and proper test first. There we go. Pietoyo can't be doubted anymore. How about this damn jerk? What do you have that can make my daughter, Eni, happy? I'll pray for Eni's future. Because of that, I'll go on hajj this year. Wait a second. It's impossible. Hajj isn't as simple as "if we have the money,... ...we can go next year." That's right. There are many things that have to be considered. If you're not the son of a minister or King Salman's son,... ...it's impossible to get in the quota for hajj! Boss Pietoyo has access to the first ring. And he even has to wait in line for that. Although next year, he'll be able to go on hajj with... ...Mrs. Pietoyo. "Baitullah" is Allah's home, sir. So the one with the right to invite others is Him. Not the president, the minister... Especially lackeys. Fine. We'll see if God up there wants to welcome you as His guest. What sign is that? Wait. - Oh, my gosh. - Is he really coughing? He's really coughing. It's not a sign. A cough as a sign wouldn't be this serious. Oh, my gosh. Eddy! Are you sure with your decision? If God is willing, Eni. Just relax. I'm not fooling around, Eni. But you're being dumb. There's someone dumber than me. Who? - Everything is taken care of. -Yeah? - Eddy talks big like that. - Yes, sir. - He's like that. - Yes. Someone from a lower level would talk with that intonation. - Help me out, sir. - I already am. Why are you crying? There, there. It's crowded here, sir, because this is a strategic place. Every three hours,... ...at least ten cars would pass by. The point is, it won't be a loss if you buy this place, sir. - I guarantee it. - Are you sure? You're going to sell it along with those cars? Wouldn't that be a waste? There's something I love even more. Sir. It's okay to love. But don't maximize your daydreaming. Minimize it. Why can't I do it, mister? Indonesia is given a quote of hajj visas from the Arab Saudi government. - That's only 221,000 every year. - 221,000 pilgrims/year From the total of all the Muslim citizens in Indonesia. Just imagine... ...how you have to wait in line to get into the quota for the hajj visa. Why is there a limit? One part of the hajj is the "wukuf" in the deserts of Arafah. And that's obligatory. Imagine if all the pilgrims from all over the world gathered there. And if one pilgrim leaves that place, it'll cancel that whole part of hajj. Fine. If I wait in line, how long will it take? You'll just wait for a bit. Just... ...ten years! Now, so that you don't delay it even more,... ...it's better if you open your savings account for hajj, right here. Or you can do it through our mobile application. You can do it anywhere. What do you think? You failed to go on hajj, right? - How did you know? - Of course, I know! It happens often! - You're the 183th person. - The 183rd person who failed to do hajj Ever since I started assisting people park here. Do you want me to help? I could help you to go on hajj this year. Hey, mister. Don't daydream too much. If you try to ask all of the travel agents in Indonesia,... ...they'll give you the same answer! But if you ask them,... ...I guarantee it. If you don't believe me, just try it. Ten years, man! The non-quota way is a special way. The way that is usually used by the royal family of Saudi Arabia. The president, government officials. They all use this! Do you understand? So, what are the conditions? Don't worry! We'll handle all of the administration procedures! Passports, visas, tickets, hotels. All of the things needed for your hajj,... ...leave it to me. You just need to bring money and sincere intentions. And how much is the cost to go there? Total Price of Special Hajj Rp. 800,000,000 Oh, my gosh. - Are you sure that's not wrong? - What? This is the lowest price. Here. A great discount. This is the first time that he gave such a great discount. Because he saw that you have a sincere heart. And sincere intentions. You'll be put in the group where you'll learn about hajj... ...straight from the royal family of Saudi Arabia. That's what he said. What do you think? He did it! Thank God! Indeed, to Allah we belong and to Allah we shall return. Power of Attorney Transfer of Title Hey. Is this real, Mr. Pardijon? - If my eyesight wasn't bad, sir. - What do you mean? It's definite. You'll lose everything, sir. Thank God. I'll go on hajj this year. Thank God! Hold onto this, okay? What is this, Eddy? Just open it. Oh, my gosh! I also took care of this ever since it was one centimeter long! Yes, Eni. I'm letting go of this for us. I'll be going. - Yes, Eddy. - Wait for me. Mom. Pray for me, Mom. Pray that it goes smoothly. I pray that God accepts your hajj. - Mr. Soleh. - Yes. I'm going. Pray for me. Guys. Mr. Jerk is going on hajj, guys! I didn't expect this to happen, guys! Be careful on the way, Eddy! The departure of 103 pilgrims for hajj who are given special treatment... ...from the staff of the hajj organizers. What are the facilities like for the soon-to-be pilgrims? There will be a group of pilgrims departing this evening there. Right now we're still waiting for the departure... ...of the third plane departing from Halim Airport. Sir. What agency are you from? Second Travel, mister. Second Travel? That's awesome, sir! Allow me to take you to your room. Come on, let's go. Let me take your luggage. So I can put it together with the other pilgrims' luggage. Please take care of it. Relax, sir. It'll be safe in our hands. - Okay? - Oh, yeah. What time will we be picked up to go to the airport tomorrow? Tomorrow at 9 o'clock. So, at 8 o'clock, you have to already be at the lobby. We'll have breakfast ready. Okay. Thank you. Have a great rest. Peace be upon you. Peace be upon you too. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Allah. There is no deity except Him. The Ever-Living, the Sustainer of all existence. Hey! Hey! Who are you? How could you get into this room? Who are you? - This is my room! - What do you mean "who"? I was the first person who came to this room, anyways. That means that this is my room. Wait. Hello? Please give this phone to the person next to you. It's for you. - Hello? - I just wanted to let you know, sir,... ...that the person next to you isn't a devil. That's your roommate. Why didn't you say so before? Sorry, sir. I forgot to tell you. Yeah. You thought I was a devil? Devils don't smell of jicama like me. Let's introduce ourselves. I'm Eddy. I'm Fajrul. Where are you from? I'm from Cempluk, Central Java. I'm from Fakfak, Papua. - What is that? - It's oil. It's really effective. It can get rid of all sorts of illnesses. - You have to try it. - Seriously? This oil is really effective. What is that? Pure coconut oil mixed together with the saliva of my dead ancestors. - What is it? - It's nothing. You caught a cold. - Use a bit of this, okay? - No. There's no need! Don't! There's no need! It's better than you throwing up here! - You'll get the room dirty! - No! I'm fine! The hospital is far away! Oh, my gosh. Help! For the Stoning of the Devil, it could be very far away. So, when you throw your stone, you have to throw it hard! What? What was that, Fajrul? This is how you should throw it. Like this. - It's far, right? - Really far. That's how you should throw it. Hey, Fajrul. By the way, how are you able to go on hajj? It's thanks to my grandma. She wants to give me her goat farm business. But the problem is that I have to go on hajj first! The biggest problem is that I like photography more! Goats are smelly! How about you? Why do you want to go on hajj? For Eni. Who's that? So, this is the story. At the beginning, I had a car repair shop. Then my mom told me to sell that repair shop... ...so that I can go on hajj. But it turns out... ...that Eni was going to be in an arranged marriage with Pietoyo. Hey. Is Eni your mom? What? No. Eni is my girlfriend. Eni's dad doesn't agree if I marry her. But I finally succeeded in persuading him... ...by going on hajj this year. After I come home from hajj, I'll propose to Eni. With Pietoyo, then? What? No, Fajrul. - Pietoyo is... - Stop. Your story is giving me a headache. You just want to get married, but it's so complicated. - You're completely wrong. - You should take me as an example! When it comes to romance, I can handle everything! I'm relaxed! The point is, if it's about me and romance, it's interesting. Look. I have a soon-to-be dream wife. We're so alike! We're like Habibie and Ainun! Is she your girlfriend? Not yet. You're just starting to get close to her? Not yet too. Do you know her? I know her, but she doesn't know me. Fajrul. Why are you daydreaming so much? It's okay to imagine it first. - Oh, my gosh. - Damn it! - It hit someone! - Use your eyes when you throw! Ouch! It hit my head! She's asking for a fight! I'll throw this! - I'll get her. - Throw rocks back at her, Fajrul! Give me some rocks! - Why is no one here, Fajrul? - Maybe the others haven't woken up yet. Or the chef hasn't cooked yet. Let's ask the receptionist. Really? It's already 9 o'clock. - He's already here. - Good morning. Good morning, Mr. Handsome! Listen. I wanted to ask. When are we going to have breakfast? We don't provide breakfast, sir. No breakfast? So, the catering order is only for yesterday... ...during the shooting. The shooting is already finished now. Shooting? What do you mean? The shooting that... Action! Cut! That kind of shooting, sir. You don't even know what a shooting is. - Sorry, mister. - Wait. Mister, isn't this the dorm for the hajj pilgrims? You want to go to the hajj dorms? That's in the big building over there, sir. This is... ...the small building. Oh, my gosh! Mister, I want to meet with the owner of this hotel. This is important, mister! Please wait, sir. I'm the owner of this hotel. Good morning. Let me introduce myself. My name is... ...Hotel Owner. Mister. Listen, mister. There were a lot of hajj pilgrims here. - Yes, that's right. - And there was the hajj staff too. Where are they now? That hajj staff took my belongings, mister! Those were all film extras. Is this your first time being extras? What "extras", mister? We're soon-to-be pilgrims! You want to pray together with others? You can do that at the mosque at the back. You have a sincere heart. We'll see. Eddy! I could help you go on hajj this year. Hajj, Ed! Hajj! Hey, Eddy! What's wrong? We were scammed, Fajrul. As an office boy who has a deep understanding of law,... ...I believe that this is a huge scam! I wish I could crush Amri's face! Me too. I'm angry too. If I meet him, I'd stab him with bamboo sticks. Amri went to your place too? We even took a photo together. Here's the photo. Which one is Amri? The one in the middle and right. That's Amri. That jerk! That means that Amri is a fake name, Fajrul! - Drink first so you'll relax. - Thank you. You just got scammed by the hajj travel agency, right? What? How did you know? Those! Those uniforms. They're the same as mine! I also have that uniform. But now, it has already been turned into a napkin. You were scammed by Second Travel too, ma'am? Over ten years ago. So, you've been here for ten years? Back then, I forced myself to go home. I pretended to be a Hajjah. When I got to the gates of the village,... ...I was happy and proud. My printed photo was so huge. Just like a billboard. It turns out that below that was the word "Wanted". I became a fugitive of society. Hey! What is it, sir? Help! Oh, my goodness. Hey, stop! It'd take too long to do that! Use this instead! Fajrul! That's... Just relax. This is effective! He's dead! If this happens, I need to have him drink it. Hey! I went through the exact same thing as what you're going through now. That's why I laughed. But now, I already became a real Haji. That woman. She was scammed in the same year as me. The same alma mater. But the difference is that I was honest with my family. I'm not like her! She's not returning home! What's important is that I'm still doing my worshipping! Amen! Excuse me! Don't listen to her. My suggestion is that you return home. Sorry, sir. I don't have the courage to return. Me too, sir. When my mom's angry, she gets extreme. She'd burn tires, burn the house. She even burned herself before. - Oh, my God. - I'm afraid of that. Let's just do this. Because both of you have helped me,... ...how about I offer help for the both of you? Do you want it? I'll give you a place to live at my house. But there are conditions. You have to help me out at my shop. Look. I'm sure that the deeper you get, you'll become more interested. If you're looking for souvenirs, everything's here. As far as I know, around here, there are about 12 people... ...who have been scammed from hajj travel agencies. But even until now,... ...they're still fighting hard to change their situation. Until they really go on hajj,... ...only then will they return home. Have you returned home? - I'm living here now. - With your family? My wife has already passed away. I'm living here with my daughter. Does your daughter also help around at the shop? I can't hope for my kid. Her life is strange. - Never mind helping her parent. - Looking for employees She can't even take care of herself. - Looking for employees - Fajrul! Come on! This is my shop. Dad! Where were you? You were supposed to help me. I have a lot of things to do. I can get money from this, Dad. How could you get money from your phone? That's why you should pay more attention to your kid. So that you know how kids are developing these days. I'm your huge fan, Miss! I'm Tutty TuLovers Fakfak! Oh, my gosh! Miss. We... - Dad! - Don't do that! You know my kid? - You don't know that your kid is... - Now who are these guys, Dad? People who were scammed by the hajj travel agency again? We can't even take good care of our own shop, Dad. And now you want to help these two people. That's why you should help me out at the shop. - So I don't bring people over! - No. I don't want to help. I'd rather vlog where it's certain that I'll get money. - Bye, Dad. - Hey! Have you fed Blacky yet? - He's already dead. - Oh, my God! Why is he dead? I only asked you to take care of him for a bit! I raised Blacky for three years! Did you know that? I'm sorry for your loss, sir. - In the depths of my heart... - Relax. It's okay. I can make another one. I'll make a dinosaur. What should I name you? I'll name you Tuti. I'll take care of you. You saw it yourself, right? How my kid behaves. That's why I hoped that you two could lend me a hand here. - I'm ready. - I'm ready too, sir. But I think that I'll just work somewhere else. Could I still live here? You can! - It's no problem. - Thank you so much, sir. Fajrul. Where are you going to work? Following the direction of the wind. My passion. Mister. Where is the owner of the studio? Do any pose! - Careful. - Yeah. Ready? One, two... Peace be upon you! Peace be upon you too. Do you also want to get your photo taken? No, sir. I saw the "accepting employees" sign outside. - Do you want to apply for the job? - Yes. Did you just get scammed by the hajj travel agency? How did you know? Of course, I know. I was scammed too. That's why I know how much it hurts to be scammed, kid. I did everything. I sold lamps. I sold cameras. I even sold carpets. But I got scammed. It hurt! It really does hurt a lot. I sacrificed a lot back at the village too. Sir, are we going to get our photo taken or not? Sorry! Wait a second. Sorry! That... Not on its neck! Do any pose! Okay. Ready? One, two... I have a lot of bags inside. But I forgot where I put them. Look for them yourself, okay? - Okay. - Thank you, Mr. Rojak. - Yeah. Peace be upon you! - Peace be upon you too! This is great, Fajrul. We'll be working a lot, huh, Eddy? Eddy, what is that? Eddy! - A rat! - Politics. Damn jerks. Stupid drama. They're over the top. Now this... A live broadcast. Eni. How is your Eddy at Mecca? You're typing like you're at the state office. Just tell him to send a photo. No picture, it's a hoax! Eddy, are you at Mecca yet? No picture, it's a hoax! She's so pretty. You keep smiling to yourself. What is it? I'm looking at Miss Tuti's Instagram. Just so you know, she has so many followers. She has 250K followers. When she uploads a photo, 100K people comment on it! 100K is 100 thousand? 100 thousand, of course! Not 100 kilograms! What's her Instagram? - She just changed it to tuttytutanty. - Oh, my gosh! You're starting to like Tuti? She's mine, not yours! What are you talking about? It's not that! It's Eni! She wants me to send her a photo, Fajrul. That's easy. Just take a photo. I know, Fajrul. But this isn't Mecca. Just hold the camera, take a photo, press the button, and send it. Problem solved. Where's Mecca? He's still at the hotel. Thank God. What's important is that he arrived there. Pretty Eni, have you eaten yet? Not yet. Eat here, okay? Accompany me. - Okay. - Are you hungry yet? - I am! - Let's go. Come in, ladies and gentlemen! We're selling hajj souvenirs. I'm already a regular at the nearby shop, mister. They happen to have discounts there. Fix it up quickly! So the result looks the same as my face! There we go! It's finished! Now you look like a Korean artist! There we go. That's my face! - I'm pretty, right? - Really pretty! Look at this. Awesome! It's only been a day! I can edit photos. I can even make a photo with an alien look real. Look at this. Awesome, right? Could you change the background to the Kaaba? I can! Fajrul. Fajrul! Do it for me, Fajrul! Fajrul! Help me out, Fajrul. Okay? Come on, Fajrul. Don't be so stingy. I know. You want your face to be in front of the Kaaba, right? I could, but it'd take a long time to edit! Come on, Fajrul. Come on. - Fajrul. - If I help you, what do I get? This game is still here. - Mister. - Where did you get it? I found it in the storage room. Oh, my gosh. Riding on a sailboat Out of tune On a tour Splash splash Won't get bored Happy birthday to you! Miss. You look amazing. When I look at you, you're so pretty! But I think you could add more of the orange color. Try to add more orange. You'd look so pretty like the dusk of Eastern Indonesia. Hey! What are you doing? You're interrupting me! Can't you see that I'm doing a makeup tutorial? Don't mess around! Why are you holding onto this? Put it down! You're terrible. Get over here, Fajrul! I'll pray that your eyes get sties! - Get over here! - Hey! Fajrul! What's going on? I was having fun vlogging, but Fajrul interrupted me! Look at my face, Dad! I can't accept this! That's enough. Listen. Listen, okay? Let's just play carambole together. What do you think? - We'll have a match. - Okay. Who's scared? Let's go against these two people, Dad. - This is good too. - You'll be in a team with Mr. Rojak. I'll be with Fajrul. What do you think? Yeah. We're going to have a match. Relax, Fajrul. Relax. If I hit it and it goes in, his face will be drawn on, right? - Come on, Dad. Go. - Yeah! - Do I draw, Dad? - Draw. Oh, my goodness. This is great. Oh, my gosh! - I'll go. - What is it? Ever since we started... - Got them both. - Yeah! Yeah! Oh, my... What is it? Oh, my goodness. - You look so ugly! - Lost again. I want to stop! I'd rather just eat bananas! Hey! Wait. Let's take a photo first, okay? - Come on. - Take a photo? One, two, three. Why are you so dark? Miss Tuti, could I ask for another photo? But with my phone! Sure. But you can't erase it, okay? Sure! Eddy. - Fajrul. - You look like Rambo! Why are you taking so long? Hurry up! I'm adding a bit more, so that it looks better. One, two, three. Okay. - It's bad, huh? - Really bad. What's missing? - Do you want me to help you with this? - Oh, my God! I'll smack you! Must be nice to climb on my table. Get down! Get down! I'll take the photo. - Do you have this size, sir? - Come in, come in. - This is 25. - Come in. - I was here first, ma'am. - I want one of these! Friday Mr. Somad. Do you have a background of the Kaaba? Stop bothering me! Look in the hajj folder! There's a lot! There's a lot. Hey, Mr. Somad. Whose photo is this? That's my friend. This! There's a camel! Oh, my God! Betawi soto! We're eating a fine dish! Remember, Dad. Don't eat too much. Think of your cholesterol! - I'll just have one spoonful! - Thank God. - But I'll use a sand shovel. - Dad, I already reminded you. - Peace be upon you. - And upon you too. And upon you too. Look at this. - That's amazing, Fajrul! - Hey. Eat first. Talk later! Yes, mister. Fajrul, send it to me. - Mrs. Hajjah. - Pretty Eni, have you eaten yet? I have. I ate with my dad. Eddy can't do video calls? I really want to. But he said that he wanted to focus on praying. - So that God will accept his hajj. - Right. So we can only chat, Mrs. Hajjah. Right again. What is it? The Kaaba looks big. It's different from when I went there. Maybe they renovated it. Hey, show it to him. - The problem is... - Dad! So... Your kid. - I'll be going, sir. Peace be upon you. - Yes. The house is over there. Yes, Daughter? It's Eddy, Dad. Thank God. They're getting along well. Hi, everyone! Welcome back! So, today, I'm at my Dad's shop. You can see it, right? Today, I want to show you the difference... ...between a real prayer rug and a locally made prayer rug. This one, guys, is a locally made prayer rug. If I'm not wrong, the real one... Eddy! Help me get the Arafah prayer rug from up there! - Sure. - But you don't need to worry. - This is still good. - Here's the prayer rug, Miss. Oh, yeah. Thank you. Could you also get some dates too? The good dates or just the normal ones? - Both of them. - The yellow ones or the chocolate ones? - Both of them. - Okay, please wait. The real one is like this, guys. The material is... The hard ones or the soft ones? - Both of them! - Okay. See? I definitely know that guy! Oh, my God! Next week is Eid, Fajrul. Are you ready to go home? Very ready! When you get to your village,... ...how do you think they'll welcome you back? I'm sure it's going to be really festive, Fajrul. Welcome, Haji Eddy! Hey. How do you think you'll be welcomed back? I don't want to go back home. I want to stay here, so I can see Miss Tuti every day. Miss Tuti, Miss Tuti. Eddy! My feet can touch you. Wash your feet and then go to sleep! Fajrul. Come on! - Get out of the way! - Hey! Get out of my way! Get out of the way! Mister! Do you have any prayer rugs from Mecca? Prayer rugs from Mecca. Please wait. I'll go check. Here you go, ma'am. Prayer rugs from Mecca. Hopefully there are some rugs left. There are. There are some rugs, ma'am. But these are the only choices we have. In your opinion,... ...since this is happening, what should I say? What you did... ...is more than bad! Eni! - Ouch! - You lied, Eddy! Hi, guys! Look behind me, guys! There's some drama happening, guys! Haji Hoax is getting caught! Miss Tuti Tutanti! - Huh? Aren't you Bagi... - Bagibagibagio, Miss! - That's me! - How did you get here? Aren't you from Java? - Calm down! - Who's that? Why? What are you doing out here? Are you possessed? - Bring him inside. - Let's bring him inside, Dad. Come on! My heart should be hurting The person that I loved has broken a promise Don't you remember that time? Full of flowers, a lovely scent in my chest Are you ready? Oh no, what should I do? This is my fate I have to bear all of this pain like this My heart is shattered when I remember that promise I didn't expect it to be just sweet words So, what should we do? I'm not involved. It's not my fault. I just accompanied Miss Eni to see Mr. Eddy. So whose fault is it, then? Really, what did I do wrong? That you broke the promise Is it because of the condition of my life? I don't have any treasure, not like you I'm suffering Because I already fell in love Oh, no! Never thought I'd be broken into pieces Never thought I'd be broken into pieces Mister, there's bad news. Oh, my God. Hey! Eddy, what's wrong with you? Hey! Oh, my God! Help! Oh, my gosh. - Eddy! - Don't fall, Eddy! Mom. Hey. What's wrong with you? You even tried to hang yourself. In my own house too, Eddy! It's better if you just go home. Don't you feel bad for your Mom? I also felt the same thing as you! I have! But I came back home! I remembered my kids! And I don't want my kids to carry the weight of my mistakes! Forgive me, God. Just go home, Eddy. Go to your mom. If you don't go home, who will take care of your mom? Eddy. Be strong, okay? - I'll be going, mister. - Yes. Thank you so much. Be very patient, okay? I definitely will, mister. Fajrul. I'll be going. Don't forget to tell me when you get there. Just relax. Your bag. - Thank you, Fajrul. - You're welcome. Miss Tuti. I'll be going. Take care, okay? - Peace be upon you. - And upon you too. Take care! What's with you? From city to city From province to province Hoax Haji! Hoax Haji! Hoax Haji! Hoax Haji! Sir? Oh, my God. sir! Wake up, sir! Oh, my gosh. - Thank you. - You're welcome, sir. Are you okay, sir? Huh? What's wrong, sir? I just want to lie down. I'm fine with the rain. It's refreshing. I already tried to poke her many times. But Mrs. Ramah is still in that static state. Did you take her to the doctor yet, Got? I already did. The doctor said that she's sick with... ...GRGRKM. (because of you) What is that, Got? Basically,... ...GRGRKM, Eddy! (because of you) Eddy, her medicine is on the table. I'll be excusing myself. - Thank you, Got. - You're welcome, Eddy. Huh? You said you were going. I'll be excusing myself. Okay, Got. Thank you. You're welcome, Eddy. Eddy. I'll be excusing myself. Oh. How much did the doctor cost, Got? Mom, I'm really not like Dad. I'm not accurate. Not accurate. I just wanted to prove to you that I could become better, Mom. But in reality... Mom. Mom. I want to introduce my friend who fought alongside me, okay? Hello, Mama? I'm Fajrul, Eddy's friend,... ...who got scammed by the hajj travel agency too. Please get well soon, okay, Mama? - Thank you, Fajrul. - You don't need to cry anymore. And especially don't try to hang yourself like last time. Hanging yourself won't make you die instantly! You'll be convulsing first. You'll experience asphyxiation first. If you want to die instantly, just put your head on the train tracks. When the train runs over you, you'll die instantly. But don't die. We still love and care about you here. - Let's do introductions. - Sure. Good evening, sir. Ma'am. Red. So pretty. - Thank you. - You're welcome. So... Anyways... What should I prepare for the wedding day? What is that? What sign is that? Saying that Mr. Soleh and Eni don't have to prepare anything. We already prepared everything. We only need healthy bodies and minds. And... Huh? Why is Eni being so quiet, sir? That means that they're a great match. A quiet person meets another quiet person. Quietly... Right. They already understand each other. They're a great match. Yes, they've got chemistry. - Chemistry. That's what I meant, sir. - Right. Huh? What's going on? The size was just right before. But why did it become loose? Tell her to eat a lot, sir. - This is... - She already ate a lot. - But after she eats, it comes out. - She's got good digestion. - Yeah, that's why she's skinny. - Oh, my gosh. So that it'll fit just right, so that you'll look pretty. I'm going to leave for a bit. Wait. Please be patient. Hey, you were asked something but you just stayed quiet. Rest. Go to sleep. Are you going to sleep while standing? If you can, that's fine. I'm also sleepy. Go sleep, okay? Close your eyes. Who is it? It's me, Eni. - Go away, Eddy! - If you're forcing me to forget you,... ...I can't, Eni. And I hope that everything isn't over. Eni. I sacrificed everything for you. I really am a reckless man whose hopes are too high. I wish you happiness, Eni. Mom. Mom. Mom. I miss your dad. Before your dad died,... ...I promised him that I would raise you to become a responsible man. But it seems that I wasn't able to. Mom! Mom, forgive me! I made a lot of mistakes to you! Don't die yet, Mom! Don't die! Hey! Who said I was going to die? I still have a lot of things to do. Crybaby. Hey. A real man... ...has to finish his business until the end. This is from Bagio. Eni? - Eni! En... - Just stay there! Eni? You idiot. You're careless! Impulsive! You don't take your time to think! And you even sent a photo of you in front of the Kaaba! Your editing sucks! It's not precise! It wasn't me who edited that, Eni. I was going to edit it myself. You'd go that far. You knew that you were scammed! Why didn't you say so in the beginning? Why did you wait to be exposed first? - Do you know what this is? - What is that, Eni? I can't see it. A needle... If you stab the body with it, it'll hurt, Eddy. You're like this needle. Eni. I never intended to hurt you. What? This is proof of it! You hurt my feelings, Eddy! - You're going to lose me. - Eni, don't be like that! Eni! Eni. - That's enough! Just stay there! - Eni! - Stop right there! - Eni! - I'm mad at you! - Okay! I'll stay right here. I want us to elope, Eddy. - No, Eni. - As soon as possible! Tonight! I want your dad to be the one who announces our marriage. - Your parent. - Fine! Then I'll leave this village by myself! I can go wherever I want! - Or I'll just die! - What? Okay! But not tonight, Eni. I haven't slept in two days. 12 o'clock at night! 12 o'clock in the afternoon! 4 o'clock in the morning! Fine, we'll choose a time between that. 9 o'clock in the morning! How about that? It's a deal. Eni! Eni. Eni. Where are you, Eni? Hey, Eddy. Why are you calling at this hour? Fajrul. I'm confused, Fajrul. Eni's going to marry Pietoyo tomorrow. And Eni asked me to elope with her tomorrow! But I'm hesitating, Fajrul. I don't want to cause anymore problems. But if I say "no",... ...she said that she'd rather die. Oh, brother. Why is your problem becoming even more complicated? Just sleep! I'm going to sleep, okay? - Bye! - What? Fajrul. Fajrul! Hello? Fajrul? Oh, my gosh. Eddy! - Eddy. - Oh, my God. - Mom. - There's a lot of people outside. Damn jerk! Come out, damn jerk! Come out! Where did you take my daughter, Eni? Don't tell me that she's inside. No, sir! There's no way she's inside! What do you mean "there's no way she's inside"? You're always causing trouble, you damn jerk. Last year, you ruined my event. You had a repair shop. You could dismantle vehicles. But you couldn't put them back together again. Hey. And now you claimed that you went to the holy land. But you actually went to Betawi land. - Now you took my daughter away! - Hey! That's nonsense! If you're going to talk,... ...don't speak nonsense! When it comes to the repair shop,... ...maybe it's true that my son isn't talented. And his blessing isn't there. But don't say that he fooled you. He's actually a victim of being fooled! - It's not your business, anyways. - Whose business, then? - It's God's business. - And then? He ran away from his responsibilities and commitments. What now? I apologize, sir. Save your apologies for Eid. - I apologize for... - Save your apologies for Eid. I apologize to all of you... ...if my presence here was a disturbance for you all. We know. But I'm at a low point right now. Why do I have to be judged like this? I sacrificed so many things to be able to go on hajj! It's true that I've gotten bad luck... ...because I was scammed by the hajj travel agency! - Nonsense. - Where's the proof? Where's the proof? Hey! This is the proof! - Something big is happening! - Come on, Bagio! Hurry up! What's going on? This is the proof! Look at this! - Mama. - Why does he look familiar? I was the one in the video call. Allow me to introduce myself. My name is Fajrul. I'm Eddy's friend. The point is, we're in the same alma mater, in the same year... ...when we were scammed by the hajj travel agency in Jakarta. And Mr. Soleh right here... He's the same as us. He was scammed by the hajj travel agency too. - Right, sir? - Hey! No! - Hey! - Stop fooling people, sir! Fooling? Who am I fooling? Burhan! Somad! Hey, Mr. Somad. Whose photo is this? That's my friend, Burhan. Last year, he failed to go on hajj. I gave him a place to stay here. He helped around here. There's a lot of photos that he made. It's all fake. Burhanudin Soleh! Oh, my gosh! Burhan! Burhan! - I missed you! - I don't. - Hey, how's your egg business? - Eggs? I miss playing PlayStation with you! What's with you! Everyone, I apologize in advance. Last year, Mr. Burhan was scammed by the hajj travel agency in Jakarta. - I gave him a place to stay in Jakarta. - No. At my photo studio. Everyone, calm down! Stop! Calm down, everyone! Calm down! Don't act like judges here! We're not criminals! We're just a handful of people who were scammed... ...by the hajj travel agency! There are a lot of people out there who have the same fate as us! And what happened to us could happen to all of you too! Eddy. - Eni? - You're always like this, Eddy. What is it, sir? - It's Eni's voice. - Eddy. - Eni? - Eddy. Where are you going? - Eddy. - There! - It's Eddy! - Eddy? - Eddy! - How are you? - Ma'am! - Watch out. Excuse us. Hey, over there! Oh, my gosh. - Eni! - What is she doing? Eni! She's going to kill herself! Don't kill yourself, Eni! I know how you're feeling! Eni, don't jump! What did you say? Stop! Give it here. Just trying to help. Eni, don't jump! What? Who's going to jump? I know that I did something wrong. But don't overreact like this. You've been acting weird, anyways. You promised that we'd go at 9 o'clock, but you disappeared first. You're the one overreacting! It's up to me! If I want to disappear first, or disappear and then come back,... ...it's my choice! But now we're already here. And my dad's right there. That means that we failed to elope, Eddy! Instead of getting married to someone who I don't love,... ...I'd rather just die! Eni, don't! Eni! Give it to me. Eni. Oh, yeah. Eni. Daughter, I know how you're feeling. However, suicide is a sin, Daughter. Come, now. You're using me to take care of your debts. Eddy's efforts for me are insignificant for you, Dad! I can't believe you, Dad! Daughter, I did what was best for you. You want to give me the best? You think that you're already a good parent? You... As a dad, you should be able to understand! Eni. Can you repeat that? You're embarrassed, right, Dad? You're embarrassed to have a possible son-in-law like Eddy. Eddy really does cause a lot of trouble. But Eddy knows how to apologize. As a guardian,... ...you should be wise! If you were wise, you shouldn't have asked me... ...to marry a loan shark who never made any sacrifices. That's actually ruining us from the inside. Why can't you see Eddy's sacrifices, Dad? - Pull! - Try pulling! Is it because you've been burdened by material things? Remember, Dad! Mom isn't here anymore! You don't have anyone else except me! You don't want to make your only child happy? Make it louder. Eddy. I want to ask you. What do you have that can make my daughter, Eni, happy? I don't have anything, sir. I only have... ...my mom. For me, the biggest happiness is being close to my parents. I allow my daughter to be married, Eni Arum Sekarwangi Jagatsofiorini... ...Wijayawati Joyohadikusumo... ...Binti Burhanudin Soleh,... ...to you, Eddy Arrasyid bin Ahmad, with the dowry of... What's the dowry? A golden ring. With the dowry of a golden ring, paid in cash. I accept this marriage with Eni Arum Sekarwangi... ...Jagatsofiorini Wijayawati Joyohadikusumo... ...Binti Burhanudin Soleh... ...with the dowry of a golden ring paid in cash! - Is it legitimate? - It's legitimate! It's legitimate! - Is it legitimate? - It's legitimate! Eni! Mr. Haji Soleh. Yes, Mr. Pardijon? Why are you still here? You should be preparing for the wedding. Yes, that's right. What a coincidence. The wedding is already finished. - What? The groom is still inside... - The wedding is finished. My daughter already... ...has a groom. Over there. - With that Eddy? - Yes. Ma'am. - Thank you very much! - You're very welcome. You disappointed me! Oh, my God! Ma'am. In memoriam Ria Irawan 1969-2020
