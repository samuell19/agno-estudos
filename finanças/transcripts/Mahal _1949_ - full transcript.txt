30 years back, on a stormy and rainy night close to Allahabad, 2 miles away from the railway station on the banks of Jamuna, there is a bungalow called Sangam Bhavan and is lying desolate and vacant since ages. It is said that on the nights of torrentia rainfall a boat appears from somewhere, stops near this bungalow which is situated on the banks of river Jamuna. And then someone is heard crying in the bungalow. People are scared of this place and consider it inauspicious. But in the quarters of this desolate bungalow, an old gardener still lives there But a strange story narrated by this old gardener is very famous about this mansion that a very painful love story had transpired here. Yes sir, a very woeful love story took place here. A 40-45 year old man would come here through the sea road to build this mansion and would return back the break of dawn. When the mansion was ready, a beautiful woman came with him and started living here. All day, she would anxiously wait for the nightfall and she would sit at the river bank waiting for her beloved. Be it a storm or hurricane, that man would come here at midnight. And would leave at the break of dawn. One night, it was raining very heavily there was a storm in the river Jamuna the boat of love was rowing towards it's destination when it got caught in a whirpool and drowned but while drowning, the last message that was heard was "Kamini, don't get disheartened." "Don't let our love fail with this blow of fate." "Our love has not failed and never will." "I will come back again". With this assurance, Kamini started searching for her peace and love in the waves of the river and finally one night, she got caught in the whirpool and drowned herself. And this beautiful mansion of their love became desolate. After 40 years, you are the first man who has come to live here again. -That's it? -Yes, that's it. The story is over. No, it's not over. It was left incomplete. You didn't tell me who was that couple. Who they were and where they came from is not known, they died with that secret. After their death, nobody came here asking for them. Since when have you been here? I have been here right from the beginning. The garden in this mansion has been grown by me. You bought this mansion, you should know their whereabouts. No, I don't know, I bought it in an auction. And in the documents the owners name is blank. That is why I could not find the original owners. You may not know anything but don't you even know the owner's name? The servants cannot know the name of their masters. He never told me and I never asked. Nobody mentioned his name that is why I never knew. Anyway, don't make this mistake again for information, you should know the name of your new employer. You never know when the need may arise. -My name is Hari Shankar. -What are you saying? The whole of Cawnpore and Allahabad know you. You are the son of a famous Judge. May you flourish in this place. You must be tired with the journey you please rest, your bedroom is there. Your bed has been laid out. Are there any other orders for me, sir? There is but you cannot carry out on this stormy night. You tell me sir, don't bother about my inconvenience. How far is this mansion from the city? Around four miles away. -Then you will have to walk. -I will go, sir. You tell me. -Do you know where Georgetown is? -Which town, sir? Georgetown, which house the bungalows of the barristers. It's close to the High Court. I know the place, where do I have to go there? Go to Barrister Shivnath's place. Tell him that his friend from Cawnpore has come. Alright, sir. I will take your leave.

What is the matter? What is the matter, Shankar? What happened? Wait, let me get back into senses I want to be silent for some time. Why is my portrait here? Shrinath, did I build this mansion in my last birth? And to complete my unfulfilled love story, I have come here? This is just a coincidence. If it's a coincidence then it's a very dangerous one. And if that is a coincidence then what did I see? Why did I see that ghost? The environment of this place has influenced you. It was nothing but a hallucination. No, I am not a hallucination, I am a reality. I am not a hallucination, I am a reality. Indeed, this place is very dangerous and inauspicious. No wonder your father is repenting buying this place. You did a very big mistake by coming here alone in the night. I came here alone because, the story which is famous about this place, I wanted to experience it myself. I didn't know this story would be connected with my last birth. No, this is not right. Come with me. You should not fall for this so soon. You are an educated man, use your intelligence. It would be better if you went back to Cawnpore. You did a very wise thing by agreeing to go back to Cawnpore. Here, in Allahabad, you wouldn't forget that unlucky mansion. And then there would be more problems. You are aware that your father has ordered me that several times. The unlucky property he has bought by mistake, I should sell it or auction it as soon as possible. And even you that going against your father's wishes is a very big mistake. You are right. Therefore, you should be away from such things. Because only your fiancee has a right over your life and thoughts. You belong to her. You're right. But don't sell that mansion. Tell father that it cannot be sold. I may get a shock if it is sold and I won't be able to bear. Okay, I am going now. Listen, few of my things are left back there. Please, get them. Okay, I will go there. ♪ O ye, my beloved will come back ♪ The lamps are lit ♪ without the flame ♪ the arrows are let out ♪ of the quiver on their own ♪ how long will anyone ache You are back? I was sure that you would come back. Why do you look so surprised? I am not your imagination. I am not a dream. Look at me closely. Don't touch me. Just look at me, talk to me. Who are you? In spite of explaining you, you have come back here? I didn't come, I was called back. You have been very unjust to me. I was seeing a beautiful dream and you startled me. No, you were intoxicated by that poison which you consumed thinking it was a cold drink, let's go. Slow poiosn often taste sweet. And deceit is always beautiful. And an intelligent man should know this. ♪ O ye, my beloved ♪ will come back ♪ O ye, my beloved ♪ will come back ♪ O ye, my beloved ♪ will come back Wait! Have you lost your senses completely? Don't you understand your death is playing tricks on you? Perhaps you are right. I am feeling very helpless. Wrong a human being has a heart and a mind too. Even when an animal is about to be trapped in a snare he tries to save himself. And you, being a human being don't get shocked? Sir, there is no scope of arguement in this case of love. You will never win come here. Come to me. Sir it's almost morning, I am leaving but I want to tell you that don't try to come between him and me or you shall regret. -What happened? -Nothing. -Who is it? -I am the gardener, sir. What happened sir, what was this explosion? Come inside. -Yes, sir? -The story you told me about this mansion you forgot to tell me the most important part of the story. -Which part? -The lady who was that man's lover her spirit roams around in this mansion. -No, sir. -But we have seen her many times. Perhaps you have hallucinated. I have been here for the last 40 years. I would have surely seen her once. It's strange! Okay, you go. Shall I send tea for you? I am asking you for the last time Your tea, master. Keep it here. Go. I am asking for the last time, won't you leave this evil house? No. So you have made up your mind to die here? If this is my fate then I have no objection to it. Then I will have to sell this mansion. Never. You cannot sell it. We will see about it later. I have come to meet you both because I need your help. I am surprised seeing you here. You never pass this way. Tell me, what brought you here? My very close friend has fallen in the snare of a woman who is deceiving him in the form of a spirit. The matter is getting very critical. That very soon, either he will become insane or will die. So? I want to divert his attention from her so that we get enough time to get him married. You both are famous for helping men who have strayed that is why I have come to you. But we are poison and you want to use us as medicine? Won't it be reverse? I know it but some deadly diseases are cured with poison. In pain, morphine injection is administered before medicine. Okay, you tell me the rates. Get the patient, money will be decided on seeing the sickness. I will get him here under some pretext. But he shouldn't think anything else after he comes here. Be careful that the snare you make should not be weak and loose. Let him come here. He will come. He has come here. Make him wait until midnight and see to it that he doesn't leave. I am sorry but you will have to wait. -How long? -For some time. Alright, I will wait. But do inform her that I am anxious to meet her. I will convey your message. Thank you. Will I have to wait more? -Are you bored? -No, but… Then wait for some more time. But for how long? I hope it's not for ages. I could be for ages but for you, the wait is for few hours. The wait differs from person to person. Please come, sir. Please come. Please, sit. I am sorry that you had to wait for so long. You look quite disturbed. I received your notice this evening. I have come here to discuss about it. Tell me. This notice says that the mansion called Sangam Bhavan has been bought by you. Therefore, I'll have to vacate that place as soon as possible. But I cannot leave it. That is why I have come here with a request that you have mercy on me and sell it back to me. I will pay the price you ask for. And all my life, I will be indebted by your favor. Please, tell me. If you would earnestly ask for us, we would not refuse you. I am glad that you didn't ask for our heart. We will return that mansion back to you. But on one condition. What? We've heard that you are a very good artist. Tell me. Make a portrait of us sisters in a way that it feels the magic is one but the chants are two. I did not understand. You didn't? One arrow and two bows. One view, two eyes. I still don't understand the meaning. Okay wait, let me explain.

You have ruined everything. Once the bird is out of the cage, he flies even higher. Anyway, I will think of some other way. Are you very restless for me? Yes. Do you know the consequences of your restlessness? My death. -Have you decided? -Look at me closely. Do you need an answer? Come if you are ready to die. -Where does this path lead? -Don't you remember? You don't remember anything. A human being forgets his last birth. That is why even you have forgotten that you were my lover in the last birth. This secret passageway leads to the center of the mansion. You used to come to meet me through this way. But I am not dead. That is why I remember the past so well. You loved me with utmost passion. You hid me here in this mansion, away from the eyes of the world. I anxiously passed the hours in the day to see you in the night. And you would come to meet me every night, at any cost. And one night, on your way here, you were enveloped by the river. And I died a torturous death thinking about you. I remember it vividly. You took another birth and were free from the woes of last birth But I have been wandering around, looking for you sometimes in the valley of death and sometimes on the road of life. And then you came and I recognized you. You may not remember me but my love nestles in your heart. And that has pulled you here. My love has compelled you to die for me because, this is the only way we both can unite. If you die, your physical being which is a barrier between us will fall and our souls will unite. Come to unite with me, you will have to jump in that river. Alright. But wait a minute I am afraid, what if again you disappear in the darkness of death? -Then? -I can come back to life. -How? -Come, let me explain. If my spirit enters the body of any such woman whom you like and can kill In that case, it is impossible to get you alive. You don't have to find such a woman, I'll tell you about her. A beautiful woman lives here, with a veil covering her face and she serves you everyday. -Who is she? -The gardener's daughter. -The gardener's daughter?. -Yes. You lift her veil, you may perhaps like her. And we may find a way of our union. Alright. But before I come in the form of that woman I want to be sure that you won't change seeing me in her body. Forget her, I am willing to accept you even as a serpent. -Then when should I come? -Right now. I will vacate that body for you right away. No, don't be in such a hurry. -Then when? -When she gets tea for you in the morning. You look at her closely and then decide. Now you go and wait for the beautiful morning of our union. -Open the door. -Who is it? Master?! What happened? Yes, master? Get the tea early in the morning. Alright, sir. -What is the matter, sir? -Nothing. -Send the tea early. -Shall I send it at 8 a. M? No, at 6 a.m. Asha, wake up. No, I will not go. Is he dead? No, he is alive. Then take him along. Wait. Shiv, you go inside. Didn't you listen to me? Come with me. Sit down. Do you want to die running after a shadow? Do you want to do injustice to your fiancee without a reason? Look at me. You want to kill living beings and bring the dead alive? Don't you want that? You can go if you want but only by moving me from your path. And it won't be easy to move me and walk towards your doom. I hope you know that? And yet, if you insist on going then take this. Come on, take it. Now move me from your path. I asked Shiv to go because, whatever would transpire between you and me there should be no witness to it. I have written a suicide note that I am responsible. Pick up the gun, what are you seeing? Shoot me, I am quite tough. And your aim is also not that bad. Pick up the gun. Shoot me. What did you gain by doing this? That picture signified, even I was happy once upon a time. I have ruined that today. My joys have been killed. I have yielded to my friends and well wishers advice. You have done the right thing. You will know later how happy and peaceful you are. Pain can be created with an incsion of an operation which is done to cure a person. One day, you will forget all the pain inflicted upon you. Yes, I will forget everything. I will stifle my feelings.

Sister in law, I was humiliated. He was about to lift my veil and left it as if he stopped himself from committing a sin. He went away outside leaving me stunned and baffled. Didn't he come back? It would be better if he would not come back. The fate of my future would have been decided that time itself. But he came back after some time and said that he would take me far away and there he would love me. But I didn't understand the meaning of his words. I fear that every night, at the strike of 2 a.m. some clock will carry her message that I shouldn't forget her. I got her message last night too and I became restless that is why I want to go to some desolate place where I cannot hear her. And I can do justice with my poor wife. Whose love has to survive amidst the storm in my life. -Whose letter is it? -Your sister's. Sister in law, it's been two years but the veil of the nuptial night still covers my face and I feel that this veil will never be uncovered because, even I have made up my mind that until he doesn't uncover my veil I will not show him my face I still have not understood what kind of a man he is but he is cast over my life like a deadly, deep secret and I fear him, since the time we left home. I want you to know what I have been going through Do you realize what a deadly experience that was? I can't walk anymore. Be bold Ranjana, you still have to travel a lot with me. -I am very tired. -Alright, rest for some time. No sir, it is very dangerous to stay here in the night. On that hillock is a famous rest house. By nightfall, we will reach there. Let's go. Be alert. -What happened? -What is down there? It looks like a sea of fire. It's not a sea of fire, the tribe of this area are taking a woman who has sinned to the temple of their deity, so that she can be put to trial. What trial? To see if her husband's accusation infidelty are right. How will they know it? She will dance in front of the deity and in the middle of the dance, the priest will aim four knives one by one, on her if she is not pierced by a single knife then she will be considered innocent. It's a strange custom Can we go there? No, we will not go there. Why not, if she doesn't die, she will be proven innocent. Men are very suspicious. Come with me.

Constable, take down her statement. -Your name? -Ranjana. Ms. Ranjana Devi your address? Okay, tell me more. He is my husband, he has been very cruel to me. He has been unfaithful to me. And today, for another woman, he has poisoned me. What? You've been poisoned? Abdul, get the doctor, quick. I will not live long now Put a thumb impression. -Tea, master. -Keep it. -Are you very beautiful? -Why do you ask? I want to see you. Lift your veil. -Who is it? -Police. -What do you want? -You are under arrest. Why? -You committed this murder? -No. Yes, you have. You hated your wife. And because of this hatred, you poisoned her. No. You surely despised your wife. You had never seen her face. -Did you ever see her? -Yes. If you have then identify her amongst these pictures. Tell me who the woman is who has spent so many months with you? Is she your wife? None of them is your wife. You surely cannot indentify her. You yourself said that you have never seen your wife. You hated her and commited atrocities on her. These are the letters written by her, you killed her and the proof is this testimony of your wife, which is in the police register along with her signature. Ashamalan, daughter of Krishna, please be present. She is the vile woman, that sorceress because of whom, this cruel man poisoned his innocent and feeble wife. She is the vicious woman who instigated him to commit this heinous offense. I object this accusation. The story of the accused with this woman on which the public prosecutor is stressing, is fabricated. And to prove my claim, I present this evidence. This beautiful and alluring face is of the woman who was killed for her sake. I would like to question the esteemed jury can you believe that an illiterate gardener's daughter this shabbily dressed woman could be the reason for a beautiful woman's murder? This ugly woman My real name is Asha. I am the daughter of Krisha, the gardener. The statement which I am about to make every word of my statement is worth pondering. That is why I request everyone to please listen to my testimony carefully. The love story which is famous connected with that mansion I too had heard that story from my father several times. When I grew up, a desire rose in my heart too. that I should also be loved in the same manner but who could love a gardener's daughter with so much passion? I could understand this truth. That is why I thought of a new plan to fulfill my desire. I would stealthily enter the house at midnight and pretend to be the woman who was loved in that palace. I would pretend to love the man who built that house. Gradually, I was obsessed with the idea that I am the woman. I fell in love with the picture of the man who built the house. And then one night, when I entered the mansion I saw him. First, I got scared and hid but then I saw his face clearly, I was stunned. He looked exactly like the man in the picture. He was the one for whom I waited so long. He was born again and had come to the same mansion. I was hiding and watching him. He saw his own picture. He had about me and started thinking I was his Kamini. I took advantage of the situation and decided that I would trap him in my love and to convince him that I am Kamini's spirit I took him along the secret ways of the mansion. I feared that before my love progressed, if he would know who I am then my beautiful dream would get shattered. And when I was sure that even if he would know I am the gardener's daughter he would not hate me I decided to reveal my true self to him. I told him that I could be alive if he would like to see me her body then he should kill her so that I could enter her body. What I meant was that when he opens that girl's veil he would recognize me. I intentionally played this dangerous game I could have even lost my life. But I was in love with him. I was even ready to die. But unfortunately neither did I die nor did I get him. And my beautiful dream was shattered. Your honor, members of the jury, the accused is innocent. He is not guilty. I start my defense with these words. The claim that for his debase reasons the accused murdered his wife. This is an allegation, there is no evidence to prove it. Making false accusations in a serious case of homicide and fabricating stories is like committing one more murder. Loving someone and not being able to forget that person, is it written in any book of law that it is a crime? The accused tried his best to forget his love but the so called innocent girl, raked his wounds which wanted to heal and provoked the fire which wanted to douse. Even she committed a sin which is proved by these letters. She tortured herself to death. If you want to punish an innocent man for the crime of this woman who is helpless himself then forget about the law and order that prevails. Members of the jury, look here Iook into these barren eyes which carries an image of a ruined life. Tell me, can you find a trace of blood in them? Tell me, can you see a spark in them which can be seen in the eyes of a murderer? People who can differentiate between good and bad you know that I have no written answer to these claims therefore, please don't decide on the basis of these letters don't forget that Jury, before you decide the fate of the accused try to judge and know very well that is this murder been an allegation or committed by him. Remember my words that the accused is innocent. He is innocent!. But the court and the jury thinks that the accused is guilty. Therefore, with deep regret we announce a capital punishment for the accused. I have called you here to tell you that I am going to die tomorrow. But you don't get disheartened and feel sad. We shall meet again. -Where? -In this world. I will come back. I will be born again. I have been born several times in search of my love I will endure one more death. I will be born again. My love, my thirst, the love for me in your eyes will pull me back here. But you don't die for me. Because if you die then in the barren land of death we will unite but I don't want to belong to you there. I want to get you here, where I have always loved you I have been unsuccessful and have gone back I am going to be hanged and I want to get you in this world. That is why I want a sacrifice from you. I want you to be snatched away from me in this birth so that you are born again for my sake I know it's a very big sacrifice. But Kamini, if you want that we should meet again then you will have to pass this trial. Tell me, what have you decided? For you and to get you I will pass any trial. You are very precious for me and I want you. The sacrifice you have asked for is far more difficult than dying thousand deaths. And for a woman, it is all the more difficult. But if I can get you back at this cost then it won't be an expensive deal for me. I am ready. -You heard our conversation? -Yes, I heard. I want a final favor from you in return of our friendship. Before I die, snatch away my Kamini from me You get married to her so that I feel the pain of this seperation in this very birth. And I don't have to endure any other pains in the next birth. What are you saying? Don't argue with me. I don't have more time. Answer me, yes or no? Shrinath, you have tried everything to save me. Make one more last attempt. Do it today so that tomorrow, I can see from the gallows that you snatched away my Kamini from me in my interest. And to get her in the next birth I have intimated my fate. Look at me for some time I want to look at you to my heart's content. We have recieved a letter and the contents are very dangerous. -What is it? -A woman has written that she is committing suicide and she holds her husband responsible for it. -Where is the letter from? -The address says Cawnpore. And it's sent from Allahabad. The address of the sender is not known. We are trying to locate her husband. -What is the name of the sender? -Ranjana. “Sister in law, after a great pain I have known his secret I know he is not mine and can never belong to me but I did not give up. If I cannot get him here, I will get him in another world and to get him, I am going towards my death and I am dying accusing him of poisoning me so that he gets death sentence for killing me and comes to me.” This letter proves that she committed suicide. And this is the police report regarding her signatures. Now you have look at them closely and decide that are wrong evidences taking an innocent man to the gallows? These are the orders from the Chief Justice. Who is it? I tried to run a lot but I am glad that my fate injured me again. Indeed after this final sacrifice, after this, nothing will be left to achieve. I am sorry that my last favor proved to be expensive for you. My friendship has caused you a great loss. But I shall make up for all the loses. Don't feel disheartened, the dilemma in which you are I have a solution for that problem. Look at me. Don't feel so sad. A human being should not feel so sad. You were in a great hurry. No man could have endured so much. You were in a great haste. And I was late in my sacrifice. But you will come back again.
