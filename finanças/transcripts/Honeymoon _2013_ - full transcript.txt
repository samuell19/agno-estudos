Co-produced by Starring Screenplay by Music by Costume designer Sound Production designer Edited by Produced by Director of photography Directed by How's the little one? Hi, Lubošek! - Dad... - Which one? Dang it... Great, the lens fell out. That's great. We have to find an optician. A lens fell out and broke. We'll be right back. - Go on, I'll wait. - You don't have to. I'll catch up. - Hi, can I help you? - It came loose and my lens fell out. Let me see. Leave them till tomorrow. I'll lend you a pair. - How many diopters? - Two. Try these. They'll be ready tomorrow. - Thanks. - Bye. - Goodbye. - Bye. ...so we may joyously celebrate the day they begin their new life together. Let us help them with our prayers, our friendship, and our love. Love is patient and kind, love does not envy or boast, it is not arrogant or rude. It does not insist on its own way, it is not irritable or resentful. It does not rejoice at wrongdoing, but rejoices with the truth. Love bears all things, believes and hopes all things, endures all things. Love never ends. As for prophecies, they will pass away, as for tongues, they will cease, as for knowledge, it will pass away. For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face. Here we go... That's better. Here we go... - Thanks. - No problem. - So, is it over? - I think it's just beginning. I'm the bride's sister. Who do you know? The groom or Tereza? - Kind of both. - And how do you know them? - Wanna go back in? I can hold the baby. - No, thanks. It's not worth it. Therefore, the man leaves his parents and joins his wife and they will be as one person. They are no longer two, but one. I, Radim, give myself to you, Tereza, and accept you as my wife. I promise to keep you in love, respect, and fidelity, to have and to hold for better or for worse till death do us part. With God's blessing. Amen. Hey, Daddy... Baby needed a change. We literally shit throughout your sister-in-law's wedding. How could you poop in church? Groom, bride, Mom, Dad! All together for a photo. Everyone smile... That's right! Perfect! I can't see the bride... Oh, my god! Now look this way... This way! Thank you. Bye! Bye! - Here? - Yes, there! Wait! Squeeze together! OK... - Great, I got it. Thanks! - Now everyone into the house. It's on its way! Gents, how about a digestive to start things off? - Cheers. - Cheers. - How do you like it? Huh? - Stop it! It hurts! OK, let's go outside! Everybody, let's go! All toasts in the garden. Let's go! Let's drink to the newlyweds' health and happiness. - Long live Tereza and Radim! Cheers! - Cheers! Yeah! That's it... It's excellent. Let me see... Good. Let's go. Just a sec. Jan, try our cookies. - They look great. - Knock it off! Thanks, Maruška, maybe later. They're really fantastic. - Ivana baked them. - They're just normal wedding cookies. - Are you a friend of Radim's? - Ivana, you obviously baked them with love. - You feel good about Radim, don't you? - You bet I do. Hard to imagine the Radim I knew as a father. - But today when I saw Dominik... How old is he? - 13. - I bet you're looking forward to more grandkids. - I sure am. - How are we doing here? Need any help? - Not at all. How did you get here? - What do you mean? - Who brought you? - Jirka and Dáša. - Jolanka, go play with the girls. - Jan, come play with us. - Well, okay. Is the baby asleep? - How's it going, Madam? - Good. So far so good. Radim? - He's here. - Who? - That guy at the church who took our picture. - What? - How'd he get here? - I don't know how or why, but he's sitting in the kitchen calling my mother by name. - Do you know him? Did you invite him? - No, of course not. - He's calling your mother by name? - Yep. - That's ridiculous. - Something wrong? - No. - Need help with anything? No, thanks. - How do you like the wine? - It's great. - Míla, zip up your fly! - The Pinot is okay but the Chardonnay is nice and dry. - I like dry wine. You chose well. - Míla, zip up your fly... - Sorry. - Well? Should I kick him out? - I don't want to make a scene. I just don't know what he wants. He says he knew you at school. - I don't remember him at all. - We fired up the grill. Maybe he's from a lower year. He's just a wedding crasher, let's let it go. - Need any help? - No, thanks. It's really something. What a haul! - What do you mean? - You, of course. - Where do the wedding presents go? - In the house. On the pool table. Dear friends, I'd like to welcome everyone. And even though I'm no poet I prepared a little something. Tereza and Radim, now you have fulfilled your dream. You now belong to one another, to love and cherish - but no other. Hands and hearts will intertwine as you help extend our line. A little girl would sure be swell but I hope his name's Karel. Tereza, you swan so white, care for Radim every night so he'll choose your garden spot and refuse to slip the knot. Although rainbows arch overhead sometimes life is full of dread. But if love is made to last your hearts are bound forever fast. May happiness always await our kids whom now we celebrate. And now, Mr. Maître D', serve the goose, your specialty. Dear Tereza, my doll, dear Tereza, my maid. They took your toys away and made you a lady today. Dear Tereza, dear maid, time to let down your braid. Cut it, Radim, cut the linden. Cut it, Radim, cut it down. Tereza said when she is wed she'd like a cradle bright and new a linden cradle made by you. - She's just like Nastassja Kinski! - What? Remember, Radim? Nastassja Kinski... - What's your name anyway? - Jan Benda. Remember? Wait, don't tell me you don't remember Jan Benda. - Sure, I do. - Well, Radim was our idol. We thought you were so awesome, and you loved Nastassja Kinski. Whenever we found her picture in a magazine, we'd bring it to you. How people change over the years, huh? I know why you don't recognize me, I look completely different now. But you haven't changed at all. It hit me as soon as you and Dominik came to fix his glasses. Is Dominik your son? No. I'm not the first but I will be the last. It was an amazing coincidence. After I saw you I just ran outside. You had such a beautiful ceremony. I'm sorry... I don't want to hold things up. You can't hold things up because I'm starving and the soup's getting cold. Well then, enjoy! Now we know he can 'cause Radim is the man. Now we know he can 'cause Radim is the man. Tereza is his new bride, she'll keep him always by her side. Now we know he can 'cause Radim is the man... Hi, Nastassja! Why's your head on backwards? That's great! I don't want it, I don't want it! Oh, you don't want it? I don't want it! That's really great! Give me all your forks! Ask please! Say thank you! We'll save you. You're doing it wrong! All wrong! Interesting person, your friend. And he's keeping the kids occupied. Here's to grandkids, Radim. We have high hopes for you, the whole family, not just Tereza. Me, Tereza's Mom, everyone. Cheers! My first son-in-law is a nice guy, but he's kind of a ninny. At least Renata is a practical woman. Renata is four years younger than Tereza but she was always a step ahead. She graduated first, got a job first, got married first, had kids first... Everything she touched turned to gold. Maybe that's why I have a soft spot for Tereza. It was hard after that mess with her first marriage. Right after the wedding, that jerk found another woman and got her pregnant. Tereza was in shock. They'd been together since 15. Well, she swallowed some pills and was unconscious for a day. I almost lost her. That was the hardest day of my life. I didn't know that. I knew they split up right after the wedding but she never mentioned this. How could we imagine she'd try to take her life because of some jerk? She became depressed and insisted she was bad luck. She said it was fate's judgment. We worked hard to snap her out of it. You can't imagine my joy at seeing her happy. You still may not think so but life is pretty damn long and lots of things can happen to a person. Be careful, Radim. If you hurt Tereza and I'm still alive I'll make sure you regret it. Just like the first guy. But I believe everything will be fine. Well, Radim, here's to trust. I hope I can still go to hookers. Sure, if I go along. - Cheers! - Cheers! I want a turn! - What are you doing? - Hey, you're fucking kidding me! - He got in my way. - Take care of him... - Jan, why aren't you playing soccer? - I'm not dressed for it. - Oh, come on. - Actually, I'd ruin the game. I'm terrible at sports. - See? He's dicking around again. - Come on! Play, Míla. Come on, let's go! - He's going after me! - Nice... You call this a game? Dammit, this isn't how to play! - Like a refill? - Yeah. You're not playing fair, man! - It's a deadly game. - That was a fucking obvious foul! Look at Míla. It's crazy how he gets so mad. - Get up! - Oh, man... You saw it. He got me here! It's a penalty! You act like it's something new. Ow! Goddamn-fucking-son-of-a-bitch! Maybe I shouldn't push my luck but we haven't been properly introduced. - No problem. I'm Renata. - Jan. Isn't it strange that Radim can't remember if you were friends at school? - I remember him very well. - So you were friends? - Ask him. - I'm asking you. Let's say we're old acquaintances. Acquaintances don't attend each other's weddings, do they? I think friends go to weddings, or people who share a connection. Connections, bonds... That's true. Like today in the church. The ceremony... Wasn't it a little ridiculous? All that conjuring, promising, oath taking... It's all such a risk. Sometimes I think marriage as an institution should be done away with. It's a relic. Maybe it should be renewable like a driver's license. Forcing two people who are actually strangers to live together forever is like putting two newborns in a box and letting them fuse together. You create a miserable monster... Siamese twins. And childhood: it's an absolute mystery. Everything is inside us at birth: evil, envy, cruelty... Is it innate or are we a blank slate? Are we predators or do we become predators? Maybe baby Hitler pulled a toy duck and was surrounded by love. Mengele was an educated man from a good family. Stalin... I really think that's all stupid crap. You reap what you raise. Murderers and sadists have adoring mothers, sisters, and wives. Where does all that love go? Or is it in our genes? Parents should know each other well, but how? Kids arrive before they reach such an understanding - then it's too late. Thinking about it gives you goose bumps, doesn't it? - I think we could talk about something else. - Why? Just because. I'd rather just get another bottle. - Not much fun, is it? - Let me go! Are you okay? Not very fun, is it? Uncle... Where is my Mom? - It hurts... - What's wrong? What? - Are you Filip's Mom? - Yeah. I'm really sorry. We were playing a dumb game - bagman - and I squeezed Filip a little hard. I'm sorry. Does it hurt? - It wasn't a game. - Don't be mad, kid. - He tortured me, Mom. - Why are you lying? - I'm not! - You're the adult, you should know better. - Sorry. - Filip, you need to knock it off. I've really had enough! - But... I told you to behave yourself. You're a guest. - But... - No, if you keep inventing... - Anything wrong? - I just don't know what to do with him. - That stranger put a bag on my head! I had a bag on my head too. - Actually, you promised to show me... - The pond. - Yep, let's go. - Are you coming with us? - He did squeeze me! - So? Are you a girl? - It hurt! - Stop arguing with me. Kids, we're going to see the pond. Hey, a cat! I took a picture of it! - He's just weird. - Relax. It's my wedding. - Someone must've invited him. - No one did. Radim doesn't remember him at all. He came on his own. I don't know what he wants and I don't want to know. I want him gone. He gives me the creeps, like he's some kind of threat. - Mainly for Radim. - Why? - Don't tell me you didn't notice. - What? His gestures, speech, movements... - He's queer. - Why does that matter? A former admirer - but not yours. - What are you doing here? - Looking. - At what? - Right now at you. This isn't funny anymore. No one knows you. Radim doesn't remember you at all. No one invited you, and I'd like you to leave, please. Did you hear me? Or should I call Radim? Something happened you should know about. Yes, a mistake happened: you showed up. Your departure will fix it. - Can we talk? - There's nothing to talk about. You have no idea. I'm not the one you don't know. You know what? Just get out of here! No, not till you open my present. OK? - Don't ruin it for her. You should leave if my sister asks you to. - Radim! - Anything wrong? - No, it's okay. Come on, kids, let's go inside. Jan Benda, huh? - What is all this? - Quite a coincidence. - What do you want from me? - Nothing from you. As far as I know it had nothing to do with you, and it was a long time ago. To me it seems like yesterday. - Hey, I'm sorry, but you should go. - You're not sorry, you're scared. Yeah? Of you? I haaaave an ideeeeaaaa! You should leave. - Goose! - Goose! Goose, goose! Come on, guys! Have you seen Tereza? Have you seen Tereza? Want a beer? Or will you switch to red wine like us? Have you seen that Jan Benda? Yeah, at the pond. - But he didn't swim. Must be on his period. - Yeah... - Cheers. - Cheers. - Seen Tereza? - No. Is he sleeping? I think so. Tereza? What's wrong? - What is it? - Why did he do it? - Why did who do what? - He gave us this as a present. - What is it? - What do you think? It has his name and date of death 15 years ago. I don't understand... What the hell is this? - Radim, what was between you? - What? - Tereza, you can't be serious. - I don't know... He's not here because of me. It's gone far enough! - What are you going to do? - I'm gonna take care of it. - Go join the others. - I can't. - Don't freak out. I said I'll take care of it and I will. - You don't know what he'll do. He's crazy. - Calm down, nothing's wrong. I'll be right back. Go on, get in! Your bus is coming. - Can I get in back? - No, just get in. I only have 1,000 crown bill... Auntie, where's Uncle Jan going? It's late, he had to go home. What's this about, Aleš? What's with the urn? - Who's urn was it? - Who's do you think? What happened to him? - You already know. - No, I don't. - Of course you do. - Who else but you and me? We know. - I don't know, goddammit! - What the hell happened? - You already know. No, I fucking don't! Where the hell are you going? - Yes, you do! - No, I fucking don't! Motherfucker! What're you doing, you shit! Where the hell are you going, Aleš? Hey, this is nice. Look how you're walking. - It's still shaking like crazy. - You're shaking! - You can't tell at all. - It's for long-distance. - What're you doing? Don't worry, it all looks good. And this is really beautiful. Like how they're throwing rice, it's fantastic. That's me! That's me! I was wondering what crap she had in her head, she had some... He actually likes it a lot! - Filip! - I can do that! - No, you can't... - Yes, I can! - Leave me alone! - They're going in the house. She's gotta stick out her tongue... Well? What? It's fine. - Is he gone? - Yeah. I drove him to the bus stop. Everything is okay. - Yeah? - Of course. Hey, isn't it our wedding? Should we celebrate? Youth never will return however hard we yearn, of all life's joys our greatest concern. Youth never will return, whatever we earn, one day it's gone and we never learn. Play on! Why aren't they playing? - We're playing! - Girls, run and play. - And you go drink some water. - Where? The pond? My little white wine from my love so fine. Your blessings give as long as I live, my little white wine. Girls! Girls, gimme that! Good night! Musicians! Guys! See you later, good night! - Bye! - See ya! - Bye! - See ya! - Drive safe! Goodbye! - Mom, have you seen Míla? - No. Radim? Yeah? - What's wrong? - Míla. Oh, god... Renata, he's here. Get up. Careful! What're you doing, Míla? Come on. Careful, careful... Hold on. God, this is terrible. Go on! Take Luboš and sleep in our room. You'll never get to sleep here. - That's ridiculous. It's your wedding night. - Well... You're just at the beginning and everything's flooded with light - until death do you part. - Just go to sleep. I don't want to sleep. Tereza is getting married today. How can you be so wrong about another person? - Stop talking crap, Míla. You'll sleep it off. - You can't sleep this off! See what you've done? - Peekaboo at Daddy! - Knock it off! You screwed up your sister-in-law's wedding! I'm smashed! Hello? Hello! I don't even recognize him. How could this happen? He'll be sorry in the morning and he won't even remember. We'll make him some coffee and won't say a word. It's no big deal. This is Dad's fault. It's like he's smothering him. Dad means well. Like that psycho said: marriage is like being locked in a box... - Don't remind me... - But that's exactly it. It's like Míla grew out of my head and together we're a monster. Come on, Míla is basically a kind and selfless person. His sweat is even different, I can smell it. - He never sweat like that before. - Come on... It's like he reeks of fear. "Anything happening?" Friday evening he crawls in bed and asks: Anything happening? What's he supposed to say? He shouldn't say anything. It's completely normal, you're both worn out. Just don't let him talk. I'll just lie on my back and let "something" happen. That's really gross. But he takes care of you, so... He studies wine handbooks because of Dad. God, how I hate that snobby crap about tannins, acidity, and bouquet. Who's he trying to kid? - Know what he bought? - No. - A decanter. He can barely tell red wine from white - and that's before he's sloshed. What else should he talk about with Dad? Picking mushrooms? And now he walks a meter behind me... He didn't used to. Why does he walk a meter behind me now? On some Tuesday, try asking him if "anything's happening". - It's time to go to Radim. - In the attic? - Yeah. - Night. - Night. Anything happening? - What's that? - What? - Did I do that? - I don't know. I probably scratched myself straightening up in here. - Come off it, you were fighting. - No... - I was just fulfilling your wish. - But I didn't tell you to fight him. He's gone, isn't he? So let it go. - Who was he? What did he want from you? - I don't know. He was always a jerk, always turning up where he wasn't wanted. Nobody wanted to talk to him. Such a sad case. - You didn't recognize him? - Not at all. He really changed but he was always a freak. Always drawing attention to himself, he even ate worms just for kicks. God, now I might start feeling sorry for him. - Why did he come to our wedding? - I can't imagine. I forgot to ask him. A crow came flying, landed on a limb. Another came flying, landed next to him. A third came flying, landed straight and strong. A fourth came flying and sang us a song. Come on, crow, fly to me, I am making something for tea. A little for the birdie, a little for the cat, crow bird, crow bird, come pit-a-pat. But it's not a crow, it's a blackbird - because it has a yellow... - Beak. A four-spot ladybug, a two-spot ladybug, a giant ladybug, a 14-spotted ladybug, and one with one, two, three... - Seven. - Seven spots. This blue one has 14. - Good morning. - Hi, auntie. What are you doing, Jolanka? - Looking at this book about animals. - Why aren't you sleeping? A bird woke me up and then I had to pee. Go back to bed, it's still really early. Jan knows all the animals in the whole world. Jolanka, go back to bed. We'll look at it later. Jolanka, be real quiet so you don't wake anyone. - What do you want? - I have to tell you something. But I don't want to hear it. How did you get in? It was unlocked. - I'm calling the police. - You can, but please don't. Give me ten minutes. Are we going to stand? I loved him like no one else in the world. Radim? No, Jan Benda. Jan Benda? But you're Jan Benda. That's what it was like... We were like one, Jan and I. One soul. He was the most beautiful, tender being - my other half. Together we made one person, we were complete. Understand? And what happened to him? They killed him. Who? Daněk, Pospíšil, and mainly Radim Werner. Radim... And I'm supposed to believe you? I don't even know who you are. It's enough that you know the victim and his killers: Daněk and Pospíšil, but mainly Werner, the others just went along. He always had some "great idea" for escaping the boredom. But you know that. My name is Aleš Klíma. What happened? When and where? Where: the boys boarding school in Bukovany. A selective school - as they kept reminding us. What others would have given to study there. The offspring of musicians and actors went to conservatories, filmmakers went to Bukovany. It might surprise you how the kids were marked by their parents' profession, standing, and ambitions. Or how the school was filled with conceited, self-centered, bored, and frustrated assholes raised with an absolutely undeserved feeling of exceptionalness. Of course, not everyone was like that. There were also sensitive, artistic souls, and those who'd inherited some talent or at least enthusiasm. But most didn't plan on fulfilling their famous parents' ambitions. - Fine, but can we... - Of course. Then there were those who were different. Maybe they didn't play soccer. That was a big mistake. Or maybe they read strange and difficult books - or read at all. Or maybe they went to mass at the nearby church. Or maybe they simply missed their parents. They arrived at age 14 when they were still children. Or maybe they were simply different. They didn't talk about girls. They didn't talk endlessly about women's pussies. Every scar on a tree trunk in the school park or crack between the mattresses had that one single significance. It was as if a huge cosmic cunt floated over the whole damned school. What's this got to do with Radim? He left the school as far as I know. Why did he leave? He didn't like it, he wanted to go somewhere else. And what you're describing happens wherever teenagers live together. You love him. You know who Radim loved then? Nastassja Kinski. Have you seen any of her movies? She made wonderful, famous films with Wenders and Polanski. But she was also in the ridiculous horror flick Cat People. In it, Nastassja changes into a panther who sometimes bites her lovers. Radim found a picture of her from the film, an artistic nude, and taped it above his bed. And in a funny way, he wanted us to share his "feelings" for her. He wanted us to worship her. He was creative about it - appropriate for an artistic school. From a makeup artist, he got a wig, lipstick, and eye shadow for Jan. From then on Jan had to become the feline goddess Nastassja Kinski. They called it "taming". What do cats live on? They lap up "milk". We don't cats like? Getting pulled by the "tail". What do cats love? Catching "cocks". So many wonderful and original ideas - where did they all come from? I guess they thought Nastassja the Cat had nine lives. Jan and I took refuge in each other. We went for walks in the empty park. Together we shared another world free of brutality and sexual innuendo, free of senseless bashing and bullying that everyone ignored. But he wouldn't even tell me what happened after lights out in the room he shared with Daněk, Pospíšil, and mainly the eternally laughing, jolly, playful, and resourceful Radim Werner. What did they do to him? Whatever you can imagine. Why did he put up with it? "Professor, yesterday I had to suck off the son of the film production boss. "And if I hesitate they make me chew up and swallow worms. "Or I can wipe shit on myself from the janitor's cat - "you see, they give me a choice. "I have to walk with my penis stuck behind my legs, "wearing a wig so I'll look like a girl, meowing and purring. "And if I refuse I get an ice cold shower "and my ass whipped with a rubber hose." They called it a grubbing. "Or I have to let them piss on me. "Don't be mad at me, Prof. Blind-As-a-Bat, "Mr. Chickenshit Teacher, Mr. Ever-Drunk Principal. "I'm terribly sorry. Good night." How did you find out? I didn't for a long time. I just thought he took the bullying harder than the other new kids. What would've happened if he told on them? He revealed it to me gradually as we got closer, a drop at a time. I discovered bruises and scars on his body. Finally he told me everything they made him do. We were like two people in a trap, condemned to death, holding each other like passengers in a falling airplane. We cried a lot. Our kisses always tasted salty. - Why didn't you do anything? - I did. I reported everything but I left him out of it. - In my version everything happened to me. - So you lied. Jan would've rather died than talk about it. - I didn't care what people thought. - But they must have investigated... They swept it under the carpet. They were expelled for repeated violation of school rules. All the parents were advised to transfer their sons to other schools. You said they killed him. That's true. We went back home - me to Beroun, Jan to Prague. He studied photography at graphic design school, he had talent. We wrote each other every week, visited each other. Finally he wrote me a letter asking me to forgive him. He said he loved me more than himself... And then he jumped from the 8th floor apartment he shared with his mother. It was less than a year after his final role as Nastassja Kinski. Hey, girls! Time for your grubbing. - Doesn't Tereza want breakfast? - She's not feeling well. - How's your exhumation going? - The mummy is on the move. I chilled some grand cru slivovitz. Like some, Míla? For your other leg... Forgive a pig if you can. - What did I do last night? - You really want to know? - Yeah. I'm sleeping and suddenly I feel some caressing under the comforter. Excellent, I think, life isn't over yet. I look and it's none other than Míla. - Do you always have to joke? - It's lovely to have such a keen son-in-law. - Míla, like some coffee? - Stick the coffee you know where. Up your ass. - Good morning. - Good morning. - Morning. - Are you pregnant? - Dad! - Mint tea? - No, thanks. Is there any beer? How do you feel? Fine. We need to go shopping for bread and coffee. - Dad, we also have to pick up my glasses. - Right. - Would you mind stopping by? - No problem. Got the receipt? Sure, I'll give you some money as well. - Tereza? - Good job, little Karel will learn to swim! Dad already took off the ribbons. He's a clever guy. - Your Highness... - Thank you, my son. - Drive carefully. - Sure thing. - Should I go with you? - I can handle it. OK, we'll meet back here. - Like the photos? - Yeah. - Did you take them? - No, a friend did long ago. I'm here for my glasses. They're ready. - Are you interested in photography? - Some. - What do you shoot? People? - Nature, animals... What kind of camera do you have? Just this digital one, but I'd like to learn to shoot film. I have lots of great shots upstairs. You can take a look if you have time. - Sure. - I'll just lock up so no one sneaks in. Why didn't you go with Dominik to pick up his glasses? Well, your parents offered. Wasn't that okay? They didn't offer, you asked. God, so I asked. They were going anyway, so what? - Right... - What do you mean "right"? What's wrong with that? - I'd have gone myself if you'd asked. And stop drinking, Tereza. - Or what? - Are you gonna hit me? Torture me? - What are you saying? - Should I rub shit on myself? - Don't be gross. Oh, right, you need an audience for that. Otherwise, it's just too boring. You saw how he behaved. He's a total psycho. I don't know what he was after, but is that how a normal person acts? - You knew immediately why he was here. - I didn't know at all! You're afraid of him and you didn't go with Dominik - because you don't want to see him. - Tereza, believe me, I barely knew him. I don't know why he was here. We hated each other - it happens. - Why? - He was a rat. - Who did he rat on? You? - Not just me. So he's the reason you left school. No one wanted anything to do with either of them, they were weird. He and Benda were two fucking outcasts. - What was so weird about them? - They thought they were better. They looked down on everyone. They said such clever things and acted like we were idiots. - And then things were missing. - They stole something from you? Not just from me, lots of things. Everyone was accusing each other till we found out it was those two fags. - What things? - Some valuable stuff. Camera filters, film cassettes... Can you blame the guys for getting even? - How? - With our hands. - Oh, right, they got a "grubbing". - A grubbing. Yep, a grubbing. I admit it wasn't right, even cowardly, but they deserved it. - What exactly did it entail? - A grubbing? - They just got a beating. - No, tell me exactly what it was. My god! Two guys grabbed him and he just got his ass beat. Just, huh? Just? A hose on his bare body in the shower - "just" that? Hey, we were kids. I know it stinks of bullying but... I suppose I should be ashamed now but they deserved it. They were a couple of thieves! And after we got even they went and squealed on us. Do you know the shit we were in? We all got expelled, dammit! Isn't that punishment enough? Why'd you tell me you left school because you thought it was stupid. Because it wasn't important. I haven't asked you about some things either. - Like what? - Like about your first marriage and taking all those pills. - So Daddy informed you? - Yes, he did. - You could've asked me! - Right... Stop fucking drinking! You're hurting our baby! Well, maybe I don't want a baby with someone I don't even know! Goddammit, Tereza! I did lots of stupid things, got in lots of shit! I had no instinct for self-preservation. I acted like an idiot, but I was 17! But I'm 35 now, someone completely different. You change during that time. That Radim is a complete stranger to me. I don't know him, I don't understand him. Fine, I'm ashamed of him if that's what you want to hear! But I won't answer for him anymore, you hear me? I won't. - You surprise me. - No, you surprise me! You don't trust me? You don't know me? Do you really think I'd torture someone? I just know what happened to that boy. What do you mean? He couldn't go on living. He wrote a letter then jumped out a window because of what you all did. - He jumped out a window? - Yes, because of you. - Nonsense! I say someone jumped out a window because of you, and you say nonsense? - How the fuck because of me? - He killed himself because of you. That just shows what a psycho he was. Gets whipped and jumps out a window? This one's a psycho, that one's a psycho... I must be one too! Yes, you are! You're blaming me for something I had nothing to do with. I wasn't even there, and I just found out about it from you. What should I do now? Apologize to his mother? Because her emotionally unstable faggot of a son went crazy 20 years ago? - You can't be serious. - You all killed him... - Bullshit, it's not fucking true! - You know it's the truth! What do you know about it? Were you there? Did you know those boys? No, you just let yourself be fooled by a fucking faggot freak who made it up. Tereza... - I also talked with Jan about... - Jan, huh? Jan's supposed to be fucking dead! Was it telepathy? Did you talk to his spirit? No, I'll tell you who you talked to. You talked to that prick Aleš Klíma - the goddamn dick-sucker who fed you all these lies! What has that asshole done to us? "I look at your picture. "You're wearing my shirt, sitting against an apple tree. "I took the picture on our first trip, the first time we got away from them. "This month I've looked at that picture more than ever before. "Anxiety comes with darkness, so I keep the lights on and keep looking. "Your face is so peaceful. "I desperately seek such peace in myself. "I call out for it, I pray for it, but I know I won't find it. "Remember when we finally got away? But the fear was always with us. "How often did you turn around even though we were long gone? "Have you learned to stop checking your shoes before putting them on, "to stop looking into your glass before you drink, "to stop checking your bed before you lie down? "Have you been able to forget? "We're gone from there, but I still sleep with a belt cinched so tightly "so that no one can pull off my pajamas in my sleep. "I keep looking at my hands, "scrubbing them over and over and smelling them, "but I can still smell that stench. I'll never get rid of it. "I'll never sleep in the dark. "I'll never swim. I'll never let anyone touch me. "I carry a knife but I'm always afraid. "I hate him and I hate myself. For my weakness. For my cold hands. "For sleeping with my eyes half open. For my cold sweats. "For the nausea I feel whenever I hear men talking together. "For retching at the smell of body odor. For not defending myself against them. "Aleš, I look at your face, I look at you, "at my only anchor in this world "and I beg that it's strong enough to hold me here. "Forgive me if I fail." Tereza, this is just a piece of paper. Is my name mentioned? Is Radim Werner written there? I can write you dozens of letters like this. I also wrote a letter like that once. Tereza, I'm not lying to you. I've never lied to you. And I'm not lying now. Please believe me. Is everything okay? Yeah? Let's go. If he went ahead we'll meet him on the way. - Is this you? - Yeah... - How old are these pictures? - Almost 20 years. I'd like to be a photographer too. - Does your friend still take pictures? - No, he's dead. - That's too bad. Hey, I just thought of something... - This is his camera. - Can I see it? It's a classic. He shot all these pictures with it. - It's great. - You can borrow it. - But we don't even know each other. What do you mean? I was just at your Dad's wedding. I'm Dominik. - I'll leave my camera as collateral. - OK, then we're even. Let me show you something. My enlarger... You can make pictures here whenever you want. Developer, fixer... That's for developing. This is for drying... That'd be great but I have to ask my Dad. No problem, Radim and I are old acquaintances. I have to go. Do you know how to load the film? How do you feel, Míla? 5% better. Hey, Grandma and Grandpa are back. - Hi. - Hi. - Is Dominik here? - What? He went with you to get his glasses. I sent him to the optical shop. - You let him go alone? - Come on, he's 13. After he didn't come back, I went to look and it was closed. I figured he headed home. Well, but he's not here. How was it closed? Are you calling him? Is it ringing? Come with me. - You think that homo would do something to him? - Let's go! Wait up! - What do you want? - Where's Dominik? - Dominik? Are you saying he wasn't here? - He took his glasses and left. - He didn't make it home. - Where is he? - That's what we're asking, you fag! - Back off! - Where's the boy? - Where's the boy? - I don't know. - Get out! Get out of there! - Where's the boy? - What're you going to do to me? - Where's Dominik? - I don't know. He took his glasses and left. He said his Grandpa was waiting. How do you know that? You talked about it? No... I don't know... We talked a little, then he had to go because his Grandpa was waiting. - His Grandpa waited but he never came! - Was he up here? No one's allowed. - What? What're you looking at? - Nothing. - What's in the closet? He's lying. I can see it in his eyes. - I can explain: he was here... - Hey! - What're you gonna explain? - We talked about photographs. - About these photographs? - No, about pictures of nature... - Where's my son? Answer me! - I don't know. - I don't know! - Where is he? Think you'll make fools of us, huh? Where's my son? - I'll tell you the truth! - Where's my son, you bastard? Son of a bitch! That's enough... - That's enough! - Where is he, you fucker? Here I am! Of course he's overjoyed the boy turned up. Hey, I can't really talk right now. I'll call you. Bye. Breathe! Breathe, goddammit! - Goddammit, breathe! - He's dead, man. - Shut up! - Please, breathe! - You killed him. - I was trying to stop you... - Come on, fucking come on! You killed him. This is fucked up... Sorry... Subtitle translation by John Brent
