The book may be out of print. This gentleman's looking for a poetry book. lt's a Du Bellay sonnet called The Pond. Did you read it? All that the eyes can see Belongs to the poet Writing is but a lifelike painting l may get it second-hand. Thanks. With pleasure. La Mandragore called again... l'll go on Wednesday. These came in this morning. l'll bring it back tomorrow. Would you like to try? lt's very mild. - Thanks. - Care for a sample? Bye. Your mum can't be on time, can she? Come on! There she comes! Did you think l'd left you behind? Don't they release you early? So? Made any new friends today? You'll soon be able to walk back home. See the grocery store? You make a turn there... And you're home. But not tomorrow. When l find a job. Eva, go brush your teeth. You're my best friend. You're my mummy! Once more! Once more? My name's Pascale. l'm 28. l have experience in acting, in theatre. l'm good at improvising. l'm pretty good in English. lf you're interested... Can't you stay in bed? No. l want to stay here. All right. Come on. - With you. - Yeah. But l can tell you're tired. Distance between you and l, A thousand things on your way, The urge to make you sensitive, The amusements of a man of your status... l'm not that bad... Don't you agree? Who will compensate for my loss? - l knew l'd find it. - l didn't! You can say you're lucky. lt was part of an estate. A beautiful library. l'll get it. Excuse me! Hello. Hello. How much for these two books? 25 Euros for both. But it's damaged at the corner. 20 Euros is my best price. Lunch's ready! Coming ! Doing fairs again, Vollard? Here's a newcomer. She does bookbinding. Doing OK? So-so. He's my ex brother-in-law. He's quite a character. He memorizes everything he ever reads! He's got all these books memorized! Cut it out, OK? Hypersia or Hypernesia... lt does sound complicated! Come on, Baldi! Let's go now! ls what he says true ? You really know all these by heart? Well... Have lunch with us. l'd love to. Not forgetting anything must be terrible. Nothing... As if your mind wasn't yours. Like words flooding your mind... lt really sucks... But it makes you hungry! Won't you try this? Thanks. - No. - Come on! Forget it. He's had enough already. From the volcanic eruptions that gave birth to it, the island has gained mountains, and offers a variety of landscapes from its spectacular coastlines. Call the paramedics! Don't touch her. Sir! Sir! Get out of the car. She's still breathing... Come on. Car's in good condition. Breath test turned up negative. The report is done. lt wasn't your fault. Will she pull through? She was taken to the hospital. They'll do their best. You'll be summoned shortly. Mrs. Blanchot? Yes... l was driving... l saw her too late. l thought she was dead... They told me you couldn't avoid her. l was late. l can't manage to be on time. They keep telling me l'm carefree, or whatever... l'm the only one she's got. When will we find out? l don't know. lt's stifling in here. There must be a doctor around. Please wait here with me. Sometimes l don't want to find out. Without you, l'd have fallen asleep, just standing up. 3 litres of oxygen... Agn?s, you watch the drips. Check on her every hour. She'll live. We've stopped the bleeding. We can't tell about her head yet. How long will it take? We must let her recover. They all say you're not to blame. l must go back to the hospital. Eva had a good night's sleep. l'm not her father... - Morning. - Morning. Pr. Veil said she's in a stable condition. You're back. l haven't slept all night. l told myself it never happened. But then l knew it did. lt was awful. When l was pregnant, l didn't realize l'd have a child. l hardly put on weight. l'm her mother. We've been moving a lot lately. But l'd always take her along. How could l leave her behind? The doctor said you must talk to her, stimulate her. You must believe she's there and she'll hear you eventually. Talk to her...? Voices are the first thing we all hear. Hello. Hello. Doing OK? Weren't you the one over to La Barre the other day? You got so far from the refuge... - l was looking for a way through. - Wishful thinking! Don't you keep off the area? You went back to La Bergerie. Belongs to me too. We'll have to sort this out. Anytime. Found anything? Remorse? Give me a break! - Give me a break! - Hit me! Can't help hitting! l thought you'd quit. lt was easier to hit my sister... They should have put you away. You've ruined everything. Mireille and the rest of us. You can drink water, all right. Your heart's as dry as your eyes. l know all this, Baldi. Just in case you forgot... When l think she cried over you... You must talk to her. Her mother doesn't... lt could be crucial for her. l understand. Hello, Eva. l did this to you. l saw you too late. Why were you running like this? l couldn't stop. ''Children of the Frost'' ln an unparalleled setting, where the light seemed to fall from the stars, Erwan had been waiting for hours. He was led through the Palace of Dreams where time is meaningless. The Prince greeted him in the Hall of Dreams where millions of humans' dreams flocked every day: ''You have encountered many dangers in the world beneath, ''walked through deserts and climbed peaks ''and you alone know the way to the white kingdom.'' Thus spoke the Prince. Erwan got the finest dreams and three dreams made by the lady who was to become the Princess of Dreams in this Palace. And Erwan was given the mission of finding her on earth. Then began the most beautiful of all journeys. Thanks. - What are you having? - The same. - The same plus one gin'n tonic. - What did you order? - 2 whiskies and 1 beer. - Thanks. 2 whiskies, 1 beer, 1 gin'n tonic. 2 whiskies, 1 beer, 1 tonic. Hi! You want to join us? No. l'm going that way. Weather's changing up at La Barre. l'll see. lf you find a way through, let us know. Robinson watched Friday shooting arrows at the sun. He picked a very long one - it was over than 6 feet long - and adorned with albatross feathers. He bent his bow with all his might and shot. The arrow rose up to at least 300 feet. At that point, it seemed to hesitate but instead of nose-diving into the beach, it flew toward the forest, blown by the wind. When it vanished behind the first trees, Friday turned toward Robinson with a large grin. ''lt'll fall amidst the branches, you won't get it back...'' Robinson said. ''l won't get it back'' said Friday, ''because this one will never come down.'' l did some sorting out. You could take them down now and then. Your latest purchase? l traded it. l'll drop by the cleaner's. l'll do it. l'm off to the hospital. lt's important that you go there. l know... But l know nothing about kids. l talk to her but she needs her mother. l tell her stories, l do some clowning around... l tell her whatever... But not what she needs to hear. When you were a kid, l remember you were frightened. Even though you never cried. l often stayed by your side to tell you stories. lt comforted you. Well, it's the same for her. You've dug that one out. The very first one... l'll never have done with this one. And his heart itself had almost turned to ice. The Queen said to him: ''l want to go and take a look ''into the black caldrons.'' Kay sat all alone in that endless, empty, frigid hall, and puzzled over the pieces of ice. All of a sudden, little Gerda walked up to the palace and embraced Kay when she saw him. But he sat still, stiff, and cold. Gerda shed hot tears and when they fell upon him, they went straight to his heart. They melted the lump of ice in it. Kay looked around him. ''How cold it is here! How enormous and empty!'' ''How cold! How enormous!'' Gerda laughed... ''How...'' She stirred... ''How cold! How enormous and empty!'' Go on, talk to her. What about? You talk to her. And don't stop talking. Eva, can you hear me? Can you hear me? l know you can hear me. Say something. One word, just one word : ''Mommy''... Won't you speak to me? lt's all in your head. Something really tiny, like a pearl. - Will she speak again? - lt's hard to tell... Once she's with me, it'll come back. lt's not only about regaining speech, she needs care. ln an institution... But she's always been with me. When you go for a walk, let me know. What for? To let the family know? Who else besides you? You know where l go : Mirbel, La Barre, my usual hang-outs. Erwan's Passage? When l think l told you about this legend... There's some truth to every tale. l'll have this one. Baldi really dressed up! lt's his daughter's wedding. There'll be 1 30 guests. Long live the bride! Long live the bride! lt's been a long time... Maybe it's time we talked again... l'm happy to see you like this. l'm not cured yet. l can tell you're OK. Too bad, Etienne... lt's been over for a long time. l can put up with your silence. Are you here for a few days? We're leaving tomorrow. l resented you, Etienne. l thought l could never love again. You stuck with the store's name. Time for the photo... They never made it home The Roaring Forties The mighty African torrents Have broken the magical dreams Oooo, They have fallen down Come Fran?ois, your turn. Yes, but... Toward which secret ocean... No... l'm sorry, l can't do it. Yes, you can! Fran?ois, come back! Now, would anyone like to sing? Come on, Miss, join me. No. l'm not coming. - Oh, come on! Come now. - l said no. Anyone else? No one at all... ? You're doing real fine. Too bad... Anything to drink? Fix her a drink, will you? No, no, it's on me. Care for a rum cocktail? Call it quits for good? l don't really know... Too bad... lt'll feel weird tomorrow... lf you can, give me a call. Hello. Etienne... Hello. l wanted to see you. Tell you how she's doing. Eva's gradually recovering. But no one knows if she'll ever speak again. She's well taken care of at the institution. They say the fresh air does her good. l'd like to ask you something. l've found a job, but it's far from here. l'll visit her whenever l can, but... l wish you'd visit her too. Me? She knows you. She knows no one but you. You see? l signed the papers and gave your name. What about you? l'm staying at a hotel in the meantime... Here's my address. Thanks. She's exactly as you said. Transparent as a soap bubble. You're harsh on her. lt can't be easy for her. You'll never get rid of your Catholic compassion! lf you could just unburden yourself, let up a bit, you may feel better. Anyone can be compassionate ! Not you! No one's ever seen you cry. But l can't, damn it! l just can't! Don't you know l can't? Etienne Vollard? Do you remember me? Of course you remember me. How are you doing now? Doing fine. Are you still on medication? - l quit. lt knocked me out. - This was the idea. Getting off the bottle is tough. l put a lid on my inner demon... Are you still overcome by floods of memories? That's for ever. Good seeing you. lf l can be of any help... Tighten your shoes. Follow the safety instructions. Good move! Go all the way... Don't touch anything. Spread out your arms. Ready? Here we go! - Julie did it! - Yeah, so you do it now! Don't make it a waste of time... Ready, steady, go! Can anyone jump like this? Of course, anyone can. Anyone without a heart condition. Are you interested? No... Well, yes, but... not right now... Watch out ahead of you! Push on your legs, will you? Ready? Any time now... lt's me... l'm back. l'm the storyteller. Want to go for a walk? lt's the land of birds. Won't you walk by yourself? Come now ! lt's OK. We'll do better next time. l'll be back tonight! Why don't you go tomorrow? Won't put it off this time. Did they pay you? They like to take their time... See you! Look, l made it for you. Like it? Pretty, isn't it? lt's like a bird nest. You can line the bottom. You take twigs and grass. lt makes a pretty soft nest. Feel it. l take a twig, l weave it, then l push it in. Then l put it up and twist it. l can see the same moon as you. When you go to sleep... We're the same... l'm cold... l've always been afraid... Afraid for you... Afraid for us... You know how afraid l am. See, it's still there. And the pebbles too. Look, there's a feather. lt's a heron feather. One day, a long-legged heron With his long, sharp beak Helved on his slender neck chanced to fare By a certain river's brink So, approaching the shore He saw some tench taking their leaps Now and then, from their lowest deeps ''What, tench for a heron! Poh!'' ''l scorn the thought, ''and let them g...'' Eva... Come along. Go ahead. l'll take care of the mail. Eva? You'd better skip the walk today. Eva got weaker. We should see her mother. - Doesn't she visit her? - She just comes and goes. She's relied on you a great deal. l'll treat you like a queen. We'll be safe here. The step of the palace. Shall we go? Let's go. The step of the... There you go. One more step... lsn't it nice here? l'll show you something else. The Pole... The Eiffel Tower... A four-pointed Eiffel Tower... Eva? Can't you find it? Under the invoice book. Left bottom drawer. Yes, that's it : ''Lyon''. Go ahead. l'm listening. l'm going there straight away. l'll be in touch. Pascale Blanchot? Paper files belong to the past... Guests just come and go. Looking for a woman! Same old story! Here people come and go. l can't help you. Hold on, just hold on... You said ''Blanchot''? We have one by that name... l guess we do have one... lt's one drink every hour... Wait. She should be any minute. Relax! Let's go now! Eva is not well. lt's serious. You need to go there. My car's in the repair shop. l'll drive you. l'll go with you. l need to call my work... Care for a drink? No. We'd better get going. There's nobody like you. You've done so much for her... l did run her over. l appreciate your coming today. lt's an omen. Omens abound. l don't feel well. l can't breathe. Could you pull over? Feeling better? l'm OK. You'll feel better inside. Don't leave me like this. Don't leave me. l've often inquired after her. l wanted to quit my job, go back to her, do something... l can't face being a mother on my own. l'm still a girl with a daughter. You go ahead. Give me some more time. l'll go... tomorrow. She's gone far away. Real far. lt'd take a miracle to wake her. Hello. Where's Eva? Wait a second. l'll be right back. l'm sorry. We can't find her. We keep searching for her. We're almost there. We're getting there. lt's good of you to have come. You've let him come near the girl. l thought he'd recovered. Out of sheer willpower. Etienne Vollard is really one of a kind. Right. But l want to know all about him. His mountain hikes. His drinking problem. His memory disorder. Everything. How can you cover for a child abductor? How come? l asked him to take care of her for me. To be with her. Because l couldn't. When l saw him for the first time, after the accident, l understood he was different. He knew everything. He'd read everything. l knew he'd find the words that would touch Eva. That's how it happened. She woke up. Believe me: She asked him to go to the mountain.
