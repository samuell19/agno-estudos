The devil has always involved himself in the affairs of man and those who turn from him in derision are his preferred victims. Better not laugh at him, because he may renew to your cost the regrettable madness whose former victims were the inhabitants of Pimprelune. They say the devil has never been able to penetrate the good city of Pimprelune thanks to the protection of a miraculous statue. Another curiosity of Pimprelune was the "Grey Tower", an old structure belonging to the parish. In this nest of rats and owls lived, supported by public charity, an old blighter named the Crank. The Crank had great credit in the city, as he made drugs better than the most able physicians. What's more, he predicted the future. This abstract science earned him much consideration and respect. Now, a certain year when tolls were few, the city found itself in debt and had to sell at auction communal properties among which was The Grey Tower. The mayor. But no one seems to want to buy the ramshackle tower. Already three candles had been lit without a single bid. Suddenly, a stranger. Let's see... A thousand pounds! Ten thousand! Whipped up by this intervention, the inhabitants... Three! Four! Five! Six! Six thousand pounds! Knocked down! My name is Marc Herner and I am a traveller. But your country pleases me and I wish to remain here. In a week I shall return to take possession of the Grey Tower. Marc Herner, but he's the famous alchemist... An alchemist! Provided that his gold isn't adulterated! The news spreads like wildfire. They regard the alchemist as an animal come from the moon. It wasn't a simple fancy that pushed Marc Herner to buy the Grey Tower. While travelling, he remembered the event which has shaken his life. Some time previously, passing through the city... He had entered the church during the hours of service. A celestial voice assailed his ears. And ever since, haunted by the elegant vision, Marc had decided to settle down in the city. The mayor who hated the Crank, prepared with perfidious joy his expulsion from the tower. Unfortunately the Crank hadn't the slightest respect for the authorities. Beside himself, the Crank then made the most singular prediction it was possible to hear. Hear me well: Marc Herner is a damned soul who has made a pact with the devil. He has only come to take your souls and render you MAD! You will become mad, STARK STARING MAD, one after the other! Remember my words when the hour has struck! In the city live two orphans... Blanche... and Rose... They were wards of the archivist Bonifacius, a man miserly and superstitious. Knight of swords You've come at the right time. Explain to me why this armed figure keeps coming up in my game. That figure represents a danger... Marc Herner! If the stranger's arrival menaces one man above all, it is certainly YOU! You know WHY! What secret unites these two men? The sinister prediction of the the Crank had made its mark. The city is in turmoil on the day fixed for the return of Mac Herner. Guided by curiosity, Blanche and Rose... The mayor, who never missed an occasion to show himself off does the honours at the Tower with Marc Herner. The good people of Pimprelune look distrustfully on the bizarre instruments contained in the cart. This smells of sorcery! Could the Crank be right? Old Patrice was a poor man who in order to survive accepted the hardest work. What is your work, my good fellow? Stay here! I'll take you into my service. Sire, you would honour me by attending a ball I am giving this evening! SHE! Who are those young girls? They are the wards of the archivist Bonifacius! That evening... Making his way to the ball, Marc wonders anxiously if he will met his beauty. It's here the archivist lives with his pretty wards! The dances begin. Would you believe me, charming Miss, if I told you I had come for your sake? It is a mean trick, Sire, to make fun so. In a neighbouring tavern... As every evening, old Patrice comes to empty a jug of wine, and with his arrival, the curious dash headlong to learn about the Stranger. He is a sorcerer. He surrounds himself with spells and evil objects. I won't stay in his service long! He terrifies me... Now that this man has arrived the hour of MADNESS approaches! Already the spirit of evil is on the prowl! It's only the night watchman... As if to redouble the terrors, a hurricane swoops down on the city. Ah! Ah! It's the devil entering the city! We must warn the mayor! Your lordship, my prediction has come true. The protecting statue is already broken! Drive out the damned magician before it is too late. The man suddenly appears to be the victim of a nightmare. But he is MAD! But this is amazing! Remember the prediction! Without being present at the scene, the archivist and his wards had returned home. Are you awake, little sister? I thought you had already gone to bed! End of Part One The Devil in the City Part Two That night the streets of Pimprelune were haunted by strange phantoms... This city is full of mysteries. You are in danger and must flee. It is the house of the archivist! I seemed to hear the sound of footsteps! A little later: A new and rowdy apparition... It is a piece of the statue! The next day was Sunday: FEAR hovered over the hallucinating city... The debris of the statue with the exception of the head had disappeared. Imagination hard at work. ... and it was then that the INEXPLICABLE began. But it's Mr Humbecque, the confectioner! He is MAD! Another madman! Another mad! It is said that those struck down by madness had received fragments of statue thrown by a mysterious hand the previous night. Remember! The man who became mad, last night... ...had, him too, touched the statue! The madmen were gathered before the mayor. Beware, Sire! They will accuse you of sorcery... Marc Herner, hoping that the nocturnal messenger would betray themself uses a strategy... But neither one nor the other showed the least confusion. In the Town Hall. These cases of madness are pure coincidence! Take these man away and talk no more of this matter! Didn't I predict it? If you don't chase the magician away you will lose your reason! The mayor plays the free thinker, avoiding the worry of making a decision. You are wrong, Sire! I, a doctor, believe there is devilry in it. One must visit the the sorcerer's lair! It is the best way to see clearly. That's it! Send the captain of the guard... Besides there is no danger! Your Lordship, the captain of the guard has gone mad! One must finally shine the light on this big man! It is you who must go to the tower, Your Lordship! That's right... I know the duties of my office! Oh, an attack of gout... One of the aldermen must agree to replace me... There is no danger! Since it concerns the visit to the Grey Tower, I will take control! That is to say take control of making a stretcher to carry you there! Night returns, ominously... At the tavern. The stone had accomplished its work. Marc Herner, far from the troubles... The hands of the statue! Good Lord, who has put them there? I'm going to the church to soak my hands in the holy water! Which malicious spirit works against me in the shadows? Blanche is seized by a strange anguish... The archivist seems violently annoyed by Blanche's flight. Enter! It is Satan's mass, the mass of the damned. There is the magician! Stone him! Stop! He is innocent! Respect the House of the Lord! It is a sacred asylum! A diversion takes place. The stretcher is ready, we can look for the mayor to visit the Tower. You! It was you who warned me yesterday! Provided she has said nothing! At the Grey Tower. Pieces of the statue! We must chase the evil one from the tower, expel him from the city! A new wonder: Since he has left the tower, the mayor finds himself free from his attack of gout. End of Part Two The Devil in the City Part Three Dawn, the many inhabitants take the safest course under the circumstances... Then you love this Marc Herner, to have so taken his defence? Love him? I don't know him, it is only two days! Marc wandered the city streets, ready for any recklessness in order to see Blanche again. Do not deny it! Your heart beat when you saw this handsome lord in danger! ...and you have almost ruined us! But your intervention will come to nothing! He will be killed! Confess that you love him! Your confusion is enough to betray you! I want to speak to you without delay. Go to the bottom of the little garden behind the house. You saved me yesterday... but you still have to tell me the truth! I know nothing! You know everything! You will be in danger... Until you leave the Grey Tower! Despite his efforts, the mayor would be obliged to make a decision... If you do not find a remedy to this danger, the population will turn against you. As for me, all my medical science is in vain against sorcery! Yet one more, and it's the doctor. Whatever next? Already the Crank fleeing at top speed across the countryside. I have unmasked the true sorcerer, the demon who cast a spell on the city. Why did you let him escape? Marc Herner has his reason for letting the Crank leave. He spent all day watching from the top of the Grey Tower. Have mercy! Let me live! I will deliver the others to you! Salt! Alcohol! Wool! Smugglers! They are the ones who have devised this scheme! But to what end? But I'm at home! They pass through this tower to enter the city! Your presence made the smuggling impossible! THEY wanted the Tower empty! Who are THEY? I would like to see my poor cousin the tavern keeper, who is among the mad! Leave me alone with them, guards! You can surely see how you frighten them! The city is in the height of fear. Marc Herner has to flee! Our trick has succeeded from start to finish, from the moment when we broke the statue... Everyone believed it was a matter of magic! Soon you will come to your senses... and we will continue with our contraband! Enough of your grimacing! You are rogues and malingerers! Ah! They weren't crazy! Ah! Ah! Not mad! The stones! We'll all go crazy! No, there is no madness! Alas, there was ONE... A sad return to things down below. I'm going to leave, leave the city! No, you can't leave like this. Blanche, my most ardent desire is to devote to you this life you have saved. My God, all this fuss over some salt! The leading citizens are compromised! The city is dishonoured. Be reassured, Sire. During my travels I have found that above all, one can lead men to the worst extremes, thanks to great words and phantasmagoria. Nevertheless I count on your discretion, because in such a case it is customary to keep silent. There is no more madness! The inhabitants are invited to rediscover their senses and return home. Thanks to the sang-froid of your municipal official the danger is avoided! Leaving the population full of joy to be so well governed, the young newly-weds make their departure... ...And they address an eternal farewell to Pimprelune, knowing they will never again there find happiness as, once the devil has entered, he will never leave.
