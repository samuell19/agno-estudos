(muffled laughter) I said I wanted you to have my baby. - [Masked Woman] I can't have your baby. - Darling, I want you to have my baby.

They turned it on - Get your hands off this. - and there was all these weird Satanic cults, chants on it. That's kinda, that's how it all started. - It's gettin' kinda hot in here.

Pirates continue to distribute thousands of copies of "Night of the Living Dead," while Romero continues to state his case in the courts. - That child wasn't mine. Dr. Lucas. - What the fuck you talkin' about? - Listen, we couldn't have a child. We both wanted to, but couldn't. - What's that got to do? - Listen, let me finish. We both needed money. You were going to college. We were gonna ask you for some, but you needed all that you had. And we both still wanted the baby. Dr. Lucas found a way to artificially impregnate her. Somethin' went wrong. - I'll say. - Shut up! You let this jerk experiment on Susan? (tense music) I read a story once about something weird like this. It was a sci-fi novel about a couple teenagers who had nothing better to do one summer than to kill the neighborhood boy named Harold. Along with everyone else in this Scottish town, the boys thought he was weird in his ways. A few times he was observed by the lake shore eating raw fish that he caught on his fishing rod. When he was young, they all bothered him because he was thin as a toothpick. And as he got older, they, they laughed at him because he was fatter than a fridge. One of the boys took a hammer to Harold's head, the claw of the hammer. And the other slashed his stomach open with a machete. Harold died from blows to the head. But it wasn't until the machete slashed him open that he smiled, the first time the boys had ever seen him smile. At that instant, out of the flames of hell, a large serpent-like beast burst out of Harold's bloody stomach and devoured both killers, and proceeded to consume everyone else in the town that it set its eyes upon. It had a hunger that couldn't be satisfied until it ate every torso in the town. - This is really no time for stories, Don. My wife's dead, and all you can do is sit there and tell about some weird story that you read in some sci-fi novel? - Doug, you're my brother, I didn't mean no harm by it. I was only trying to ease the tension. - Ease the tension, you damn bastard! Ease the tension, you dick! - I'm sorry, Doug, I really didn't mean it. - Why don't you and Fred help me to ease the tension right now by helping me find out what has exactly happened to Susan? - Okay, okay. - Why don't we do something about this, call the police or something? - Can't do too much, can't make it through those woods. The phone's out, can't do nothin'. Might get attacked by bears, rattlesnakes, this is a real creepy place, you know. - Besides, Grizzly Flats is the closest town to here. That's nine miles away. They'd be cratin' us away in pine boxes by morning. - I guess we'd all be dead, wouldn't we? What're we gonna do? - Great, so we're stuck. - What're we gonna do with Susan's body? I never thought I'd have to live with the dead. (gentle piano music) - Tomorrow we'll make the nine mile hike to Dr. Lucas'. And then I'll phone the cops. - [Don] That guy should be locked up for good. He's got a criminal mind, he's evil, should be dead. - Fuck, give me a beer. (scary swishing) - Hey, what happened? The lights went out. - Relax, listen man, the electric systems in this place are scuzoid anyway. Fuses get overloaded all the time. (tense music) - Ah, there's a lantern outside, but the gas is probably all used up, uh, it was pretty low when we were walkin' through the woods there. Is there a flashlight around? - 14 days have passed since Brooklyn residents Don Drake and Fred Lewis were last seen alive. Police are investigating a tip from a New Jersey woman who says she saw them murdered by a gang of bikers and dumped into the Atlantic Ocean. At the moment, it is only speculation. More details will follow soon, back to Johnny. - Tabloids report that bagel boy Rob Camilletti, Cher's boyfriend, has been seen around town with Traci Lords in some of the hottest Hollywood clubs. - Don't you mean ex-porn star, Traci Lords? (both laughing) - [Both] Are we still on air? (suspenseful music) - [Don] What the fuck? - [Doug] Where's Fred? - [Don] I think he went into the third, fourth, and fifth dimension. It looks like he got sucked into that mouse hole. - [Don] I think I know what happened. - [Doug] What? - [Don] Spontaneous combustion, I read about this crap. - Listen, spare me the stories, Don, we gotta get to the fuse box. There's blood on my face, there's blood all over my hands. (towels scraping) One thing I can't stand is blood all over me. (tense music) Yeh, ah. (scary music) Why in the world did you have to bring Fred? (water dribbling) (spooky music) - [Don] You never told me you were a kindergarten artist. - [Doug] Well you never told me that you were an asshole either, I had to find out for myself. - [Don] That's pretty disgusting stuff you nailed on your basement door. - [Doug] Our niece did that before we tortured and ate her. Wait. (rapid whirring) (gentle music) - [Don] Let's tackle this right now. - [Doug] No, we'll change the pictures later. It's too dangerous now. (gentle music) (Don sighing) - Grab me a couple of beers, make yourself useful. - There ain't no beers, dumbbell. Everyone alive in this house knows that there ain't no beers. - There's gotta be somethin' around here to drink. - Well I know that there's whiskey or rum around here somewhere. Take a look in those cupboards. (light, mellow music) - Well, pilgrim, and some paper cups. (laughing) What do you think about that? - Paper cups, eh? I got one for ya, how do you get paper children? - Paper children? - Yeah, how do you get 'em? You fuck a bag lady. (Don laughing) - Oh, (laughing) god. - Yeah, I'll drink to that. - Did you hear that? Fred? - Fred? - Fred! He must've went to get some help. Oh, god. - Fred? (hissing) He's dead, I know he's dead. (door clicking) I know he's dead. (laughing awkwardly) (groaning and crying) (Don laughing) - Oh, joke's on you. Hey, did you hear that, you hear that? - That? - I didn't hear nothin' at all. I just didn't want you to pour any whiskey on me. Lost your train of thought, didn't I? (Don laughing) - That's that fuckin' booze. - Oh, I think I'll have another drink. Oh, hey, there's a, there's a hair on your arm. - That is my fuckin' arm, man! (Don laughing) - Does the toilet flush in a blackout? - Why? - I gotta take a wicked piss. - What's stoppin' ya? - [Don] I really gotta go to the can bad. - Yeah well, go then. - There might be some of those ugly creature things in there. - That's right, you wouldn't want any of those things nibblin' on you when you get in there. - [Don] Why don't you go check it out then, you goofball? Ooh, what a reek. Huh, I think we're gonna have to go back to the kitchen and get a flashlight. Huh, yep, we'll have to get a flashlight.

(Don grunting) Ah, put you back down, you're so heavy. (groaning) Blood, ooh, gross. Ah, I should've hit you again for being in the way. (somber heavy rock music) Ah, stupid light. You fuck. It's hot. I better watch myself, I'm not very good at electricity things. (somber rock music) (Don muttering) Oh, I hope I get this right.

What is there to do? Great so we're stuck. What are we gonna do with Susan's body? Other than the fact we have to live with the dead. You, you're dead, you're dead! Doug, no way, no way am I gonna let the creatures eat you alive, you're comin' with me. Oh, you heavy puke, oh. (groaning) (saxophone music) Now stay in this closet so they don't eat ya.

So much for privacy in the good old U.S. of A. - They ate Susan, that ate her to the skull. (crying) There's worms and maggots everywhere, get it outta her face.

So, she called up a girlfriend of mine and says, "I'll get a bunch of my girlfriends "who really are porn stars to come down "and show up on the set and surprise Don Frankenheimer." So we came down there just as a joke, and he seen me, and he says, "Oh my god, Amber Lynn, "I'm a big fan of yours." He says, "You gotta be in my movie." So I was like, "Oh shit." So when I met Ann-Margaret, I was like speechless. I couldn't even talk around her. And he kept, he wanted me to do this one line about Cecil B. DeMille. And she walked over and stood next to the director, John Frankenheimer while he was, he says, "Run the line for me." And I was like. (man laughing) I says, "I can't." He says, "What do you mean, you can't?" I says, "I'm sorry, I can't do it," and I turned around and walked away. And he like, for some reason he followed me over and he says, "Listen," he says, "You know this is, "you're playing this stripper in this part," he says, "This is your part of the movie "and as far as I'm concerned, you're the star of this part." And so he made me feel real comfortable. - Was that the, - Oh, that's good. - I kinda missed it, but was still "52 Pick-up?" - Yeah, it was, it was "52 Pick-up."
