PART 2 The radiant Habsburg sun reached eastwards, to the border with the Russian Tsar. It was the same sun under which the Trotta dynasty had risen to nobility and distinction. The gratitude of Franz Joseph had a long memory, and his favour had a long arm. When one of his favourite children was about to do some folly, the ministers and imperial administrators intervened in a timely way, brought the foolish child to their senses. As thus, Carl Joseph, Baron Trotta and Sipolje, could not cross the southern border and only had the choice between a interior posting or one on the eastern border, and chose the Jäger Battalion, which was stationed no more than two miles from the Russian border. What a region... - Seventeen hours by train. - This is my home, sir. In Burdlaki, just over there. Well, then at least it’s not far for you. - Are you Trotta? - Yes. - Schnabel. Hello. - Hello. - I’m to bring you to your quarters. - It’s quite a long journey to arrive here. You can still change your mind, while you still can leave. You have no idea how dull it is, out here. But you get used to it, however difficult. - Do you want to go for a drink? - No-no, thanks. I don’t drink much. That’ll change. We drink “ninety-grade” here. If you get used to that, then slivovitz tastes like water. - And what else happens here? - Nothing. Local peasants come here to trade of sorts with the Polish. It’s so dull, here. But Count Chojnicki holds these parties, when he’s here. - Who’s that? - A landowner. Lots of money. He’s in Vienna in the Reichsrat and travels a lot. And when he’s here, he weekly holds a party. It livens up the place. We all stay in Hotel Brodnitzer, decent lodgings don’t exist here. The borderland is swampy, the poppies are in bloom; - nothing else blooms over here. - Must make beautiful views. We have a District Judge, a District Commissioner... My father is also a District Commissioner. Yes, I know. And your grandfather saved the Emperor’s life. We all know that. So rarely someone new joins us, so we want to know everything about him. So, we have a church, a cemetery, and all around us swamp and liquor. It’s so dull, here. The more the soldiers drink. The more boring it is, the more they drink. Poor show! I come back from my morning walk – no post, the breakfast looks all different; where is Jacques? Jacques is indisposed today. Indisposed? - He’s sick? - He has a fever. But Jacques has always been healthy. Like the post. Let someone else bring me the post. What’s wrong with Jacques? He has a fever. He must have caught a cold. In May? He’s not young anymore. Send for the doctor. - Your breakfast, milord. - Thank you, I’ll be in my office. And yesterday there has been another meeting of Czech workers – a so-called Sokol celebration has been announced. And the social democrats are acting up, as well. In the yarn factory, a worker was beaten up by his fellows, according to our spy for refusing to join the Reds. All these organisations need to be dissolved, immediately. Especially when they start thinking about writing “resolutions”. Of all the words that became modern, lately, that one I find the most disgraceful. Perhaps because it’s only one letter away to change “resolution” into “revolution”. All these elements threaten the existence of the monarchy! - Can’t you see? - Yes, Lord Commissioner. Shall we arrest those revolutionary agitators? “Suspicious individuals,” they should be called! Write it down! Remember it, Mr Leschetizky! So, suspicious individuals will be arrested. There are parts of our population that don’t feel Austrian. Something “nationalistic” went into their heads. The peace is disturbed, decency is blemished; now they even want to set up Czech schools in their “resolutions”. They want to introduce Czech as a classroom language. Perhaps there are revolutionaries somewhere in the Empire; in my district – remember that, Mr Leschetizky – they do not exist! Have the gendarmerie reinforced against these Sokolists, write a short report to the District Council, perhaps we need to liaise with the military authorities. The gendarmerie will be on high alert, from tomorrow. - Get me Slama. - Yes, Lord Commissioner. Has the doctor been in yet? I saw him after he had checked on Jacques. What did he say? He doesn’t have high hopes. He asked how old Jacques was. I didn’t know. He must be around seventy-eight or eighty. I haven’t noticed that before. As long as one walks around, one expects to live forever. Ah, Your Lordship! Well... You’re doing not too bad, the doctor just told me. - Probably a catarrh. - Yes, milord. Now I’m waiting for a priest. Yeah-yeah-yeah. He’ll be here. There’ll be plenty of time for that. When the late Baron died, none of us suspected anything. In the morning he got up and said, “Jacques, where are my boots?” Or was that a day before? No, no! It really was on that day. But the next morning he didn’t need them anymore. And then winter came – it was a cold winter. Until next winter I think I can manage to hang on. Yes. Around Christmas all can come to a halt. March off. Company! March! Do you know that one, milord? That’s a canary bird. Cute bird. Please, milord, the window. So he can smell the spring! Beautiful day, today. There he comes... There... there he comes! On a white horse... All dressed in white... He rides so slowly... That’s because he comes from yonder. Do you know how he used to look like? I’d like to see the painting. I want to know if he really changed. Bring it to me, please. The painting of Papa? Yes. Yes, that’s what he looked like. Say, just look how old I am. I forgot all about it. Well, where shall I put it? There. Down there. That is my army service book. Please read me a bit. “Franz Xaver Joseph Kromichl”... Is this your book? Yes, of course. Then why do you call yourself “Jacques”? Well, those were his orders. Right. Well, then you’ll be eighty-two in August. What day is it today? May 19. And how long before August? Three months. I won’t live to see that. Say, in that box lies the book of St. Anthony and St. George. You can get that for me. And a piece of snapdragon root, against fever, you will send it to your son, Carl Joseph. Give him my best. He’ll need it. It’s so swampy, over there. And... close the window, now. I want to sleep. Did you send a nurse to Jacques and gave him all he needs? - Of course, milord. - Did you receive instructions to root out these so-called Sokol-organisations? Yes, sir. The instructions are very clear, sir. Your Lordship, it seems that Jacques is now fully conscious and without fever. He came out of bed and could even dressed himself. But that’s impossible. Please don’t get up, Jacques. Don’t get up. I just realised I spoke so familiar to Your Lordship. Never mind that, Jacques. It was the fever. I babbled like a dead man. And you must arrest me for identity fraud, sergeant, for my real name is Franz Xaver Joseph! And under my army service book is my savings book, and in it is enough to pay for the funeral and Mass. And there I’m called “Jacques” again! Time trieth truth. We can wait. Look how they shine. It’s hot, for May. I don’t know, I feel a bit chilly, now. I’ll go in and put the canary bird in the sun. Strange. Right? Very strange. Your Lordship... Your Lordship, please come quickly. That’s how I’d like to die, one day, dear Slama. To die... My wife also died. Everyone dies. Lord Commissioner, Miss Hirschwitz says you haven’t had breakfast again. Mind your own business, Mr Leschetizky. I’ve decided to pay my son a visit. Make sure that Jacques’ canary bird is fed regularly. Don’t forget the water, and give it a lump of sugar once in a while. Yes, sir. But you cannot leave now. The Sokolists! I can. I want to see my son. Jacques was the last one to have known him – my father. The hero of Solferino. The Emperor knew him, too. The Emperor and I, we’re the only living persons who knew him. I want to go to my son. Well, Papa, here’s your room. All my mates live here and they make a lot of noise, but there is no other hotel. No problem. No problem. So... It’s not so wild out here. - Is there some entertainment? - Yes, at Count Chojnicki’s. You’ll meet him. I like him a lot. So he’s the first friend you ever had. The regimental surgeon Max Demant was also a friend. - Do you like it in the infantry? - Yes, very much, Papa. - And your horse? - It brought it with me, Papa. - Do you ride often? - Rarely, Papa. - Don’t you like it? - No, I never liked it, Papa. Stop calling me “Papa”. You’re old enough. And I’m on holiday. Something wrong? You don’t look at all like a young lieutenant should. Is it rough? Thank you, Papa. Ah, this is a root. It’s supposed to help against malaria. - Jacques sent you that. - How is he doing? He already passed on. He passed on... You say that like an old man. I’m sure you have a lot of secrets I don’t know. We are father and son, but between us lie the years like great mountains. I know no more about you than about any other lieutenant, perhaps anyone in this army. You enlisted in the cavalry and were transferred to the infantry. One doesn’t know any more about the other. Ah, well... Perhaps I’m getting old. Look at the root. I am inquisitive, gentlemen. No other passion than this sends me out into the world – to the tables of the great gaming halls, on the parliamentarians’ benches, but every spring I return to here and throw my parties. I’m so incorrigibly inquisitive. And additionally a friend of your son. I took the liberty of preparing a little snack for you. To your health. That’s some strong stuff. It’s what we drink at the frontier. Right, Carl Joseph? Indeed. People here drink it a lot. Strange things you eat here, at the frontier. Strange but good. Even to someone like me, with a spartan nature, these finer things in life are nothing to be scorned. Cheers! Since the farewell dinner of Prince Metterlich, who then was sent on a secret mission in Herzegovina, I never had such a feast. The Austrian is a man of senses after all, just like the writers of operettas suggest. - A carefree heart. - Cheers! I’ve invited you here, so we wouldn’t be disturbed in the New Castle. There my door is, so to speak, always open, and all my friends can come when they please. This is usually the place where I work. - You work? - Yes, just for fun, so to speak. I continue the tradition of my forefathers, I mean, not as seriously as my grandfather was about it, because the peasants of this region thought him to be a magician. Well, perhaps he was one. They think I’m one, as well. I’m not. Well, so far, I haven’t been able to make one single speck. A speck? Of what? Well, of gold, of course. I know a bit about chemistry. As you can see, I have here the oldest and newest equipment. Curious. Very curious. Oh, no more curious than whatever else I might try. Should I become Minister of Culture and Education? It’s been suggested to me. Should I be Head of Section at the Interior Ministry? That’s been suggested to me, too. Or should I go to court, become Comptroller of the Royal Household? I could do that, too. Franz Joseph knows me. “Franz Joseph”? Oh, beg your pardon. I meant, his Majesty knows me. By the way, you remind me of him. Yes. You remind me of Franz Joseph. And why – forgive me – would it be just as futile to serve the Fatherland as it would be to make gold? Because the Fatherland no longer exists. I don’t understand. I expected you wouldn’t understand. We all are no longer alive. I don’t understand. How could the monarchy no longer exist? Well, of course it technically still exists. We still have an army and officials, but it’s falling apart. It’s falling apart while still alive; it’s already fallen apart. An old man – with one foot in the grave, every sneeze could finish him – remains on the old throne, merely by the miracle that he still can sit. But for how long, gentlemen? I ask you, for how long? This age doesn’t want us anymore. This age wants to establish autonomous nation states. People no longer believe in God. The new religion is nationalism. People no longer go to church, they go to national associations. Our Emperor, his Apostolic Majesty, is like a secular brother of the Pope. Purely apostolic. No other monarch in Europe is as dependent on the grace of God as he is. The German Emperor still rules even if God would desert him; perhaps by the grace of the nation. The Emperor of Austria must not be abandoned by God. But now God has indeed abandoned him. Do you hear the rain? I’d never have believed there could exist such a person in this world who could claim that God had abandoned the Emperor. So you believe... So you believe that we’re... We’re doomed. You, your son, and I. We are the last ones of a time when God still extends His Grace to monarchs, and madmen like me create gold. You see, this is the age of electricity and chemistry. Not of alchemy, you understand? Do you know what that stuff is called? Nitro-glycerine. No more gold. In the palace of Franz Joseph they still use candles. Nitro-glycerine and electricity will be our downfall. It won’t be long. Not long at all. Come, we’re going out, there’s a little party. Only those who live the whole year here at the frontier, think it is a big one. Papa! One gets used to the “ninety-grade”. You know, it doesn’t go to the head but only to the feet. Then nothing is painful anymore – in office and out of office everything then goes so smoothly and fast, and you don’t think. The brain has a way out. - You should... - Yes? You should be careful with liquor. Well, you know, there comes a time in every man’s life when one has to drink. I’ve never drunk too much. What did you say, Papa? You should be careful with liquor. Why? Drinking will ruin you. The painter who painted grandpapa’s portrait also drank. Do you remember that painting? Have you forgotten about it? I haven’t forgotten anything. I also think about that portrait. I’m not strong enough for that portrait. I cannot forget the dead. I cannot forget anything. Father... If only I could help you... I myself came here to seek help. Jacques is dead... The world becomes more and more difficult. Before, everything seemed so much simpler. For every situation there was a certain approach, right? When your boy came home for vacation, you would put him to the test. When he became a lieutenant, you would congratulate him. I don’t know what I should do when you call me “Father”. There’s a telegram for you. The bellboy brought it over. I’m called back, I’m afraid. Yes, something to do with the Sokolists, I assume. - There will be disturbances. - Right. Yes, it isn’t easy to do anything about disturbances in this cursed monarchy. If you arrest a few ringleaders, the deputies and the newspapers will pounce on you, and they’re all set free again. Break up the Sokol Association, and you’ll be rebuked by the governor. Autonomy? Sure, just wait. Here, in my district, every disturbance ends with bullets. Yes, so long as I live, I’m the government candidate and I get elected. Fortunately this area is sufficiently remote from all the modern ideas that they spawn in their filthy editors’ offices. Hey... Hey! Your father has to leave. I’m sorry, Father... I’m a bit concerned about him. Well, rightfully so. He has to get away from here. When I’m on holiday, I’ll try to show him a bit of the world. And then he won’t feel any desire to come back. Who knows, perhaps he’ll even fall in love. I won’t fall in love. Come now. We have to go. I have to pack. Father... if only we could talk to each other... - Anything to eat? - No, the old man isn’t there. - Did your father leave? - Yes. Pity. If he’d have stayed a moment, he could’ve witnessed the opening our proper little casino, just like the ones in Monte Carlo. Really? Do you believe it’s true? Yes, finally. It’ll be a splendid gaming hall. A proper one. By God, how long has it been since I’ve played roulette? You know, the way the ball rolls, I love it so much! Brodnitzer won’t open a casino. Not him! I told you, Kapturak from the Ukraine he will lift the ban on gaming halls. He already creeps around in our hotel. - A shady figure. - Well, you see? Who cares, boys? As long as it gets us some fun. And maybe we’ll even win something. Just our luck! There’s one single factory here, and of all, that one had to go on strike. - Is this the first strike in the area? - Yes, the authorities were in panic. Well... For decades they’ve done nothing but organize a few censuses, celebrate the Emperor’s birthday, assist in the annual military recruitment, So this is quite another thing. We have officials who do nothing. They do something. They arrest a Ukrainian or an Orthodox priest, and certain people they catch smuggling tobacco. And don’t forget the spies, of course. The factory has been here for decades. I believe it produces brooms. My orderly says the workers get sick – tuberculosis, and die in hospital. But they never went on strike, right? Suddenly all the gendarmerie posts in the area had to be assembled. Guess what the gendarmerie do instead of assembling? They dispatch a report to the governor’s office. What does the governor’s office do? They send the report on the Army High Command. What does the Army High Command do? They come to me. So there we are. Of course, war is much more pleasant than such a thing. After all, we’re no constabularies or police officers. But there’s no war for now, unfortunately. And orders are orders. And what are the orders? Well, in certain circumstances we’ll have to advance with lowered bayonets and... well, command to open fire. Well, what to do? Nothing. Nothing can be done. But in the meantime nothing will stop us from going the casino, - and win a lot of money. - A lot of money? On the first evening Kapturak opened the baccarat, I won five hundred crowns from a Silesian landowner, but now, now I have more debts with him. Well, be glad that at least something’s going on. Finally something’s happening in this stinkhole. Faites vos jeux, messieurs. Rien ne va plus. - Trente-cinq, noir. - Passe. Officer, come here, we’re thirsty. Is everything gone again? How much, then? Two thousand crowns until now. No small sum for me, Captain. Just go to Chojnicki. I already owe him three hundred. Captain, you can use my name at will. Who’d loan me that much on your name? Mr Kapturak. So this is about two thousand crowns? Can you pay me back? No idea. - A lot of money, Captain. - I’ll... pay you back. How? In what instalments? You know that only a third of your wages can be garnisheed, and that all your mates’ salaries are already committed. So I don’t see any possibility. Mr Brodnitzer has been so kind... Brodnitzer... Mr Brodnitzer over there also owes me a lot of money. I could lend you the desired sum, provided one of your comrades, whose wages aren’t garnisheed yet, would step in. For instance lieutenant von Trotta. He used to be in the cavalry, he owns a horse; and a horse is a value-fixed object. Sign, quickly. He’s waiting over there. He sees that you’re reluctant. You haven’t yet been down in the gaming hall? - No. - Well, come on down. I’ll be expecting you. One sixty. Well, how is it going? Lost two hundred. That red is cursed. I have no luck with roulette anymore. It has to be done differently. Here. I want to try it over here. Did you win? Lost, lost. Too bad, too bad. Take me, for instance. I often win, I often lose, I’ve lost everything, won everything back. One mustn’t stick to the same game. Just don’t stick to the same game. That’s the main thing. You’ve never touched a card? No. And to think I first won so nicely. I only lost, the whole time. But Kapturak won five hundred crowns! Five hundred, yes. I have signed another IOU. When you mix cognac with “ninety-grade”, - that is a great recipe. - That recipe... needs to be tested. Those bloody military wages! It’s a bloody shame! It doesn’t even allow me to play as a human being! - Sell me your horse. - Oh, no. - You have to sell it to me. - Oh, just take it. I’ll pay. I’ll absolutely pay! - No, I don’t want you to! - I order you to sell it to me! Sir, yes, sir! But I don’t have any money. That doesn’t matter. - I’ll give it to you. - No, definitely not! I don’t wanna buy it anymore. Well, I could sell it to someone else. Isn’t that a good idea? Excellent. But to whom? Well, for instance to Chojnicki. Brilliant. I owe him five hundred crowns. I’ll take it over. You look like hell! I didn’t shave. You look like an alcoholic. - Do you want my horse? - I know, you don’t like riding. Right? No, that’s not it. I need money. I covered for a friend – a great sum. I cannot lend him that much. And the officer in question already owes you. But he’s no concern of yours. This whole matter is none of your business. You’ll pay me back, soon. It’s a trifle. You see, I’m rich. Yes, people call it rich. Money means nothing to me. If you’d ask me for a drink, it would be the same to me. My God, what a fuss. Look at this. All these forest belong to me. It’s quite unimportant – simply to spare you pangs of conscience. I’m grateful to anyone who takes a bit off my hands. Good morning. - Good morning. - Good morning. It’s settled, this afternoon. Thank you. Thank you. - Listen... - Good morning. I got it now... My luck will hold, now. You just proved it to me. Just now! This afternoon there will be 2,500 crowns. 1,500 I’ll immediately give back, and I’ll sit down at the baccarat table – perfectly calm, perfectly carefree, I’ll break the bank. He’ll shuffle the cards himself. And with his left hand. Well, perhaps I’ll pay back only a thousand for now, and play with 1,500 – five hundred for the roulette, and a thousand for bacc... Well, I’ll have to think about that. I’ll have to think about it. Where did you leave Trotta? Haven’t seen him. - Everything? - I gave you my word. Excellent, Captain. It’s about time. It is high time poor Trotta is relieved from his friendship with that crazy Wagner. We’ll send him a few days on furlough, and with you, in fact. With me? What does he look like? You’ll accompany him to Vienna. You’ll like him. I know your taste. Well, you know, my husband is not normal. Many would consider him insane. But he’s sweet, and easier to handle than a child. “Till a joyful reunion,” he always says when I visit him in the psychiatric ward. And I say, “until we see each other swiftly, dear Alfonse.” You’re a young man, but you look worn out and sad. Have you experienced sad things? And have you learned from them? Were you ever on leave? No, I rarely go on holiday. “Due to important family affairs,” I told them. Well, whatever Chojnicki sets his mind to, will happen. I’d like to smoke a cigarette. Oh, please, do you have to smoke discretely? On my account you can smoke in here. We’re on a bridge, now. I’m always afraid on a bridge that it will collapse. It won’t collapse. You say that as if you wanted to add “unfortunately”. Why are you so sad? I’m not sad. But I thought of kissing you. Then I put it off again. You shouldn’t put it off. My name is Valli. Yes. I have something unpleasant for you. Well, it’s about quite an everyday matter, namely that a Jäger platoon goes out tomorrow morning, and position themselves opposite the broom factory. No, thank you, sir. I don’t understand. You’ll command the platoon which will take action against possible “seditious disturbances”. You just need to keep a cool head and not intervene prematurely. And in the end the district officials will decide whether your Jäger will have to proceed or not. Oh, this certainly isn’t pleasant for any officer; how can you take your orders from a district commissioner, after all? But on the other hand, this delicate task is a sort of distinction for you, as the battalion’s junior lieutenant. And besides, the others haven’t had any furlough yet. You see? Platoon... halt! Let them fall out. Right turn! Rifle down! Halt! Right turn! Fall out! You’re a bit too early. The demonstration is expected in the afternoon. I’m going for a drink, in that pub. But that’s not possible, there are workers in there. So what? A “ninety-grade”. A double. Attention! My instructions are to have the rally broken up immediately. Are you ready, lieutenant? I’m going now. Company! Left turn! By the right, march! In the name of the law, I order this rally to be disbanded! Push back! Why don’t they shout, lieutenant? For God’s sake, let them shoot! First row, ready! First shot in the air! Fire! Shoot! Let them shoot, lieutenant! Shoot! For God’s sake, shoot! Fire! I have to learn from the papers that my son is wounded. You can imagine what the opposition makes out of this matter. So what? Do you think they’ll succeed? Carl Joseph might come under investigation, but it will be performed by Army officials. Well, you see? On the contrary, he might receive a medal for his exemplary behaviour. But there will be an investigation. If I hadn’t visited him recently, I would go there, right now. To him. Leave the army, Max Demant said. But instead of leaving, I was transferred to the frontier. I want to leave! Out of this army! It... It isn’t my profession! If only I knew where I am at home. You have to write me another sponsion – 1,500 crowns. Kapturak explicitly demanded your guarantee. But you mustn’t worry; I’m going to buy a race horse. I’ll run it in Baden, and make it win everything – a magnificent creature. You’ll see. Roulette... Roulette, roulette... Captain Wagner is dead. He shot himself in the border forest. He left a farewell letter for all his comrades; and a special greeting to you, Baron Trotta. He’s dead. Jacques is also dead, Max Demant as well, Wagner too, and the workers I had shot, too... They call for me. They call for me. We have to play roulette! Roulette! Roulette, roulette... What kind of story is this? Who put this on my desk? Where is Montenuovo? He’ll be here any moment. It’s almost eight o’clock, Your Majesty. Strange. Why do I suddenly have to think of the Battle of Solferino, while reading this deed? When will Montenuovo be here? At eight o’clock, Your Majesty. Yes, you already told me that. Solferino... What’s about Solferino? Tell me, do you know the name Trotta? Trotta? Trotta... Yes, I know! Trotta! He saved Your Majesty’s life. Oh, right... Oh, right! Yes! Is he still alive? - Well, I don’t know... - Well, we’ll have to write it down. To settle this favourably. People think I know less than they, because I’m so much older. But that’s not true. I might even know more than many would think. Trotta, Solferino... I remember it clearly. What’s planned for today? Prince Montenuovo comes for an audience. And then it’s off to the manoeuvres at the Russian frontier. That’s right! The manoeuvres! I have a cold. But don’t tell anyone, for God’s sake, otherwise I cannot join the manoeuvres. And I love to go to the manoeuvres. War is something terrible. But I love the military. I wished I could sleep in the barracks with the officers. But no, at manoeuvres I always have to sleep in a castle. Once, during that ill-fated Italian campaign, there was a flea in my bed – a real, genuine flea. But I never told anyone about it. An Emperor doesn’t talk of insects. I already knew that as a young man. How nice the air is. It’s wonderful. The land is flat and wide. The General said the windows are facing the north-east. That means I can look towards Russia. But I cannot make out the border. I would have liked to see the frontier of my empire. My country, in which the sun goes down. The beautiful stars – they are already fading, all of them. The throne and God Almighty. How nice the crickets chirp. Or are those the stars? Do they also chirp? I’ve been here before at manoeuvres. I think I also slept in this room before. But was that ten or thirty years ago? Or when was it? I’ve lost my sense of time. But now the day is about to start. Shave! I’ve outwitted them all, now. All day I haven’t a moment to myself. But I made up for that with fifteen minutes. Well, come on! Shave me! Bäumer always whistles this song. I’d like to know what it is. Do you know what it is? Well, don’t look so foolish. Oh, right! It’s... I forgot it again. Hand me the agenda. This will be a daunting day – three masses after another, with the Greek one. I’ll have to pull myself together before God as if facing a superior. And I’m already so old. He could have made many things a bit easier for me. But God is even older than I am, and His decisions seem as unfathomable to me as mine seem to the soldiers in the army. And where would we be, if every subordinate could criticize his superior? Don’t worry, colonel Lugatti, I found the parade already tiresome. I want to inspect the regiment, and see the army walk passed me. Aha, those are the new knapsacks and bread pouches. Let me take a look. What do you have in there? Canned goods, aha. Yes, yes. What’s your name? Well, tell the colonel. What’s your name? Where do you come from? Milutin Doroslovac. What kind of battalion is this? Your Majesty, I present to you the 16th Jäger Battalion with 387 men. Aha, very nice. Very nice. Let’s see. Is he ill? Lieutenant Baron Trotta has just regained his service for a few days, Majesty. He was wounded by revolutionary elements, while quashing an anti-state rally. Trotta? Trotta? I know that, right? There was something in the deeds, recently. It’s the grandson of the Hero of Solferino. Aha! Yes, yes. I have a great memory. I clearly remember your father. He was very modest – the Hero of Solferino. Your Majesty, that was my grandfather. Ah, so it was your grandfather? Well-well. And your father is an officer, right? Chief District Commissioner in Weißenkirchen. Well-well. I’ll make a note of it. Well, let’s continue. I think I caught a cold. But I know that already. We’ve been playing chess for years with each other, dear doctor. I notice the whole time that you have something on your mind. My son wrote to me, quite some time ago. He wants to leave the army. I don’t know how to respond. First I thought it obvious to simply forbid the boy leaving the army. But now I believe I don’t have the right to forbid anything. Your son doesn’t want to stay in the army, and I can understand that. You can understand that? Absolutely, Lord Commissioner. A young officer in our army cannot, in his right mind, be content with his profession. His yearning must be war. But he also knows that war means the ending of our monarchy. The ending of our monarchy? The ending, Lord Commissioner. Let your son do as he pleases. Perhaps he will be better at some other profession. Ah, I don’t know. I think everything loses its meaning, somehow. Anyway, I’ll write to my son that he can do what he wants. Yes. No person can take over the responsibility for another. My father did that for me. And my grandfather for my father. When your late father said you wouldn’t be a farmer but a public official, then he was right, for you’ve become an exemplary official. But when you told your son that he had to be a soldier, then you were wrong. For he is not an exemplary soldier. No. He’s not. And therefore we should let each go on their own path. Each on their own path. You often need money, Baron Trotta. Every fortnight you come, when you’re on furlough and go to Vienna. The baron often goes to Vienna. Yeah, the ladies... - Will you give it to me or not? - Of course I will. Of course. My accounting is in order. Truly in order. I believe it makes about 6,000 crowns, right? You believe? Don’t you make a note of it all? I’m not so good with numbers. Save journey, lieutenant Trotta. And come back in good health. Yes? A telegram, sir. Damnit, Valli has to see her husband. I’m not going, Onufrij. This time you won’t be going to Burdlaki. - I’m not leaving. - Very well, sir. - You’ll stay here! - Sir. - Well, don’t you mind? - No. I play harmonica on Sunday. God knows I don’t find it that easy, in this dump. Every fortnight I live only for the two days in Vienna. In this godforsaken dump! This idiot in the loony bin... I should’ve stayed in Vienna and not return in this army. Dismiss. How did you get in here? Good evening. What do you want? I see you haven’t left for Vienna. I’m not going. I just wanted to check. I’ve just been to see Captain Jedlicek. - He is not there. - So? Well, he is not there. What has happened to him? He’s been arrested and put on transport, on suspicion of... espionage. I don’t wish to hear anything about it from you. Go now. Unfortunately not possible. Not possible. I must insist on a partial repayment. Yes... - Tomorrow. - Tomorrow... Tomorrow might be impossible. You can see what surprises each day may bring. Captain Wagner was your friend. Captain Jedlicek is his successor. I’ve lost a fortune to Jedlicek. Who knows if we ever seen him again? You’re also his friend. What did you say? Nothing. Repeat what you just said. Nothing. Sit down. I have to sit down. Yes. I’m just staying for a moment. I need to recover. Next week, at the same time, at this exact hour, I’ll ask you for the entire sum. I don’t want to do any more business with you. It is 7,250 crowns in total. I must also inform you that Mr Brodnitzer is standing outside the door and has heard everything. Count Chojnicky is returning, as you know, maybe later than normal, this year, or perhaps not at all. I’d like to go now... lieutenant. - Did you hear everything? - Everything. - Was Brodnitzer here? - Yes, sir. A spy... Jedlicek is a spy. What will I do now? Very unpleasant. How much did you drink before attacking him? - Half a bottle. - But that’s... It’s a very awkward issue. In any case, I have to report it to a higher authority. Well, perhaps that can wait. Do you have the money? - No. - Then I don’t know, either. Why did you need all that money anyway? Well, never mind that. Well... Well... Write to your father, today. My savings amount to the sum of two thousand crowns. I shall put it at your disposal, Lord Commissioner, if you please. I thank you, doctor. I’ll accept it. I’ll have to. I’ll write you a promissory note. But where will I find the rest? The rest? It’s still 5,250 crowns. The boy awaits my reply. This age is to blame. Perhaps also the frontier garrison. Perhaps also I. Carl Joseph is sincere and decent, but unfortunately also weak. I cannot just throw him over. Not to speak of our name. Our name has been dishonoured. Please excuse that silly word. But what if the boy is kicked out of the army? In your position, I would go straight to him – straight to the old man, to the Emperor! Or perhaps that’s just a childish idea. But no! That is an excellent idea, doctor! The simplest thing in the world! No-no, it’s not that simple. You don’t have a lot of time. It’s not possible to request a private audience within two days. Whatever will be, will be. You will go to the mail office and telegraph my son. The content of the telegram, listen carefully: BEING TAKEN CARE OF. GREETINGS, FATHER. - Have you understood? - Yes, sir. Send Miss Hirschwitz up. I know people in Vienna! My schoolmates, who are all in influential offices, like me. Madam, I want my suitcase packed within half an hour. Uniform with top hat and medals. Half an hour. Of course, milord. This evening I’ll travel to Vienna. Well, I really would like to help you, dear Trotta, but you know, even the influence of a simple, senior state official has its limits. But I know who could do something for you – In the Comptroller’s office is that lucky devil, that Gustl, you know, that fool who made his career. That is, his career will soon be finished, namely with the death of the old man, even though he married a countess. You have to visit Gustl Hasselbrunner. Mr von Hasselbrunner is away, but councillor Putwinitz replaces him. Perhaps Lord Commissioner could go to him in the meantime? Yes, dear friend, I mean... You know how gladly I would like to help you. If it were something else, with pleasure. But this, dear Baron Trotta? Well, I cannot help you in the least in this matter, but Chief Municipal Councillor Busch? By the way, at this time he’s always at Demel’s and eats. Well, that’s out of the question. It’s absolutely impossible what you ask of me. It all takes time. Two or three weeks, at least. Besides, the Emperor is still in Bad Ischl. Come, have some petit fours and relax. But naturally you have the right to see the Emperor. Of course it is possible, but the timing, dear friend... The timing! I have to fix this matter! Do you understand? I have to fix it! I’m trying to find some way to break protocol. It’s just impossible. My father also broke protocol! With his hands, he grabbed his Majesty by the shoulder and pulled him down! - Understand? Like so! - I know! I know! I’m doing all I can, dear Trotta. You know that. We need to go back to Hasselbrunner. Can’t you call on him, tomorrow? I only have three days left, all in all. Three days. I cannot recall a similar case. It’s quite beyond all imagination. It’s impossible. Believe me, dear friend, it is really utterly impossible. Again another Trotta? Didn’t I recently speak to some pale lieutenant? It must be his father. And was it his grandfather who saved my life? But he couldn’t be a District Commissioner. He may enter. Well, dear Trotta? Your Majesty, I beg for the clemency for my son. What kind of son do you have? My son is lieutenant with the Jäger, Your Majesty. Well-well... That has to be the young man I saw at the last manoeuvres. Hasn’t it? But he’s a wonderful fellow. He almost saved my life. Or was that you? Your Majesty, that was my father – the Hero of Solferino. What? How old is he now? But at the Battle of Solferino... there was this lieutenant, wasn’t there? Yes, Your Majesty. Yes, he was recently with me. He then became a captain, when I gave him the Franz Joseph’s Order. Or was it some other? Please come closer. Your Majesty, I beg clemency for my son. Yes, it’s all right. It’s all right. Please stand up. Nice weather, today. Isn’t it? Wonderful weather, Your Majesty. Strange. These whiskers are completely out of fashion. Yes, it’s true! The officers nowadays, I saw a few with perfectly smooth faces! And in grey uniforms. They look like lumps of clay! Oh, yes, I have to go to Bad Ischl. I still have so much to do. Your issue will be solved. It will be done. It will... What has he... What has he done, anyway? Debts? Yes, Your Majesty. It will be settled. My regards to your father. My father is dead, Your Majesty. What? Dead? A pity. But back then, at Solferino, he was there... I remember very clearly. Well then, dear Trotta. These Trotta’s... I must write it down. “The Trotta... “Affair.” Yes, Franz Joseph’s arm has a long reach. The whole thing has been settled by the highest authorities. And Kapturak has been deported? Simply gone? And did you know that the gaming hall also has been prohibited? Yes, the grandson of the Hero of Solferino can rely on His Majesty. And again it will be dull. Just drinking. Nothing else. You all know what the dragoons have been up to. - Yeah. - What then? Well, next year will be their centennial celebration, and so they came with the brilliant idea – because they are just as bored as you are – to organize a dress rehearsal today. - That’s really great! - Great idea! - Who’s coming? - Oh, the reserve officers of the regiment, all the pensioners, all the officers’ friends and relatives, of course the regiment’s senior staff, the honorary colonel, in short, the guests will come from everywhere. Well, and of course they’ll have to invite us as well. - Hopefully Chojnicki will be there, too. - Well, he has to. If it rains, the whole thing will take place in his castle. Colonel Festetics expects at least a hundred guests. - How many? - At least 54 hussars. I was so much looking forward to such a garden party. Everyone thinks a thunderstorm will come, with this sultriness. We haven’t had rain for four weeks, this is the hottest June ever, and today, of all days, there’s supposed to be a thunderstorm? Well, bye. I’m going in. Hello. Give me some light. - Did you read that? - Yes, sir. - Keep it shut. - Yes, sir. Well, what is it? Are you scared of the thunderstorm? It’s not the thunderstorm. Well, what then? I shouldn’t tell you, but I cannot keep quiet. Colonel Festetics just received a terrible message. Well, what then? “HEIR TO THRONE RUMOURED KILLED IN SARAJEVO.” - Those were the exact words? - Those were the exact words. Have all the windows closed and draped. And have my carriage ready. I want to go to town. Yes, sir. Well, what’s wrong? It has just started to rain. Just now. Supposedly the heir to the throne has been murdered. What do you mean, supposedly? Guests, that arrived three hours ago, said so. They found a broken telegram in code in the governor’s office. The telegraphic traffic has probably been jammed due to the thunderstorm. We haven’t received any reply to our inquiry. Moreover, today is Sunday, and there is almost nobody in the offices. The agitation in town and in villages is rising steadily – despite the storm, people were out in the streets. What can we do? You’ll understand, gentlemen, that, in spite of all festivities, I needed to announce this news to you. It’s hot in here. I’ll open a window. We must break up the party. - That’s not possible. - Why not? The whole preparation, and I... We all... It will not do. The news isn’t true. It’s not true! We need prove that it’s true! “Rumoured” is just a fat lie. A mere rumour will suffice. When the heir to the throne really is killed, there still are other heirs. When the heir to the throne is killed – firstly, we know nothing for sure about it; secondly, it’s none of our business. It is our business, but he simply wasn’t killed. - It is a rumour. - But, gentlemen... Bosnia is far away from here. We don’t give a damn about rumours. I spit on rumours. We ask the gentlemen to continue the conversation in German. I’ll tell it in German. We are in agreement – my compatriots and I – that we can be glad when that pig is gone! What? I know... that His Imperial Highness has really been assassinated. My grandfather... saved the Emperor’s life. I am his grandson, and I will not allow anyone to insult the House of our Supreme Commander in Chief! The gentlemen are behaving scandalously! It is a scandal! A scandal! A scandal! If anyone says another word against the dead man, I’ll shoot him! Quiet! Be quiet! Order him to step down. Lieutenant... Leave us. The heir to the throne has been assassinated! The funeral march, please! The funeral march! The pig is gone! Sir, Major, sir. Tomorrow I’ll hand over my resignation. Perhaps you’re right. You’re young. What else should I’ve said to him? I’m scared. Scared, that’s what I feel. Father, I’m leaving the army. After the tragedy that hit us the day before yesterday, this decision looks like... - desertion. - The whole army has deserted. The monarchy is dead. Probably. Tell Miss Hirschwitz that dinner will be twenty minutes later. Come, let’s get some fresh air. Greetings, Lord Commissioner. Fresh air does wonders. Right? Yes, papa. - Would you like a soda? - No, thank you, papa. I’m tired. Let’s sit down. It’s the first time I sit here on a bench. Since my transfer to this town, I walked here daily... but never sat here. I saw the Emperor. I didn’t want to tell you, but the Emperor himself settled your matter. We won’t talk about it anymore. It’s hard to say it... But I love you very much, papa. I’m sure Hirschwitz will be wearing her grey silk. Tafelspitz, cherry dumplings will also be there. Everything is like before. Yes. Everything is like before. Well? How does it feel to be my administrator, lieutenant? I’m free. I’ve never been free. Don’t you regret the life you left? I’ve always been a soldier. But I now I start to understand a bit about life. That wasn’t really planned. At least, not by the imperial lieutenant. It finally happened – war has started. We’ve been long expecting it, and yet it took us by surprise. Well... Clearly a Trotta isn’t allowed to live in freedom for too long. My uniform lies ready. I think in a week or two, we’ll be sent to the front. Nature has never been so peaceful. You can look at the sun with your naked eyes. Do you know what that is, over there? Wild geese. They’re leaving us early, in midsummer. They already hear the shooting. They know what they’re doing. They’re leaving us. Fire! At ease! Right shoulder arms! Left turn! Forward march! War in the Austrian army begins with courts martials, to deter the living. Yes, but the living are fleeing. A war that begins with retreat, but not with an organized retreat. There is no such thing as an organized retreat. You think they’re all traitors? Well... Hasty court martial makes for hasty sentences. Some brass sends unverifiable messages about peasants, priests, teachers, officials. We have no time. We have to retreat. But also to punish the traitors hastily. Ah, well... - Water! - We’re so thirsty, lieutenant. There is no water. All wells are contaminated by corpses. We’ll have some water. On the last day they hanged the corpses over the wells. Bloody pigs! I think the Russians have caught up with us. The road is wider, over there. There are rails, over there. There’s the station, maybe we can be transported from there. The station is blown up. There are no trains there. Then we’ll fall back along the rain embankment. There must be trains, somewhere. Move! We’re safe, here. For a few kilometres we’re covered by the rail embankment. The Cossacks! The Cossacks, on that slope! Take cover! - Water! - Water! - Water! - Water! Water! Stay here! Stay here! We already have twelve casualties. They soldiers want to go to the well. Platoon halt! I’ll get you some water! Nobody moves! Get me some buckets! I got them from the machine-gun section. Praised be Jesus Christ. Praised be Jesus Christ. Praised be Jesus Christ. Madam, my son is dead. Mr Leschetizky, my son is dead. Mrs Rossmantel, my son is dead. My son is dead, Mr Witranik. My son is dead. My son is dead, waiter. Another one. I just received the message. The announcement must have been left on the carpet of my office. I have to... That night and many nights thereafter, old Mr von Trotta did not sleep. His head trembled and waggled on the pillows. Often the District Commissioner dreamt about his son. Lieutenant Trotta stood in front of his father, his officer’s cap filled with water, and he said, “Drink, Papa. You’re thirsty.” This dream kept recurring, more and more often. And gradually the District Commissioner managed to call his son every night, and on many nights Carl Joseph appeared several times. Mr von Trotta began to long for night and bed – daytime made him restless. When spring came and the days grew longer, the District Commissioner darkened the rooms, in the morning and the evening, prolonging his nights artificially. The war didn’t seem to trouble Mr von Trotta that much. He only picked up a newspaper to conceal his trembling skull. A long time had passed since the news of his son’s death. Seasons had replaced one another according to the ancient, steadfast laws of nature. barely perceptible under the red veil of war – least of all to the District Commissioner. His son was dead. His office was terminated. His world had gone down. I received a letter today from a certain Mrs von Taussig, unknown to me, currently a voluntary nurse at the Steinhof asylum in Vienna. She tells me that Count Chojnicki has returned from the front, insane, for a few months, and that he often speaks of me. “He keeps saying in his confused utterances “that he had something important to tell you.” And if I happen to be planning a trip to Vienna, my visit to the patient might unexpectedly restore his sanity, as had occurred in similar cases, now and then. Is that possible? Well, anything is possible. If you can bare it – I mean, bare it easily. I can bare anything. I knew your son. Since when have you known my son? Before the war. We were in love, Carl Joseph and I. Forgive me, but was that foolish history because of you? Also because of me. I see, also because of you. I wish Carl Joseph could still get into foolish histories... because of you. Let’s go to the patient. Leave us, Valli. We have something important to discuss. Welcome to my house. Please have a seat. I’ve called for you to tell you something important. Don’t tell anyone. Except for you and me, no one knows this. The old man is dying. How do you know? From higher up. Nurse Valli! The audience is over. - They say the old man is dying. - I know. I’d like to go to Schönbrunn. The Emperor is dying. The Emperor cannot survive the Trotta’s. He cannot survive them. They saved him, and he won’t survive the Trotta’s. And how is he doing, now? - I don’t know. - No news. He’s dying. I’ll pray for his soul. Are you the old postman of post office Schönbrunn? No. Have you known the old man? Yes, he spoke to me, once. Now he’s dying. So this is death. I wonder what that whispering is, around me. But they don’t hear me. I just cannot ask them. Strange, that they won’t answer me. But I forget the questions, and the answers, too. The priest will arrive soon. In contrition and humility I confess my sins. Why doesn’t anyone listen? There he is, the Capuchin! I have to confess my sins. So proud... So proud I’ve been. I’ve been Emperor for too long. Did I say that out loud? Everyone has to die. The Emperor also dies. War is also a sin. He doesn’t hear me. I have to wonder. Every day brings casualty lists. There’s war since 1914. Make it end. If only I fell at Solferino. They don’t hear me. Perhaps I’m already dead, and I speak as a dead man. That’s why they don’t hear me. I will sleep now. I’m going to bed, madam. I’m tired. Yes, but... You’ve never gone to bed during the day. Are you... Are you ill? I’m tired. Dear Dr Skovronnek! I’ve had Jacques’ canary bird brought in here. Give him a piece of sugar, please. A sweet bird. Right? Yeah-yeah. A sweet bird. He’ll survive us all. Yes, he can survive Austria. He can. Give me your hand, dear friend. Could you bring me the painting? Please? Was it a beautiful death? Yes, beautiful. Very beautiful. Leave it. I’ll play a game with myself. It’s raining. So much rain, this autumn. RADETZKY MARCH BASED ON A NOVEL BY JOSEPH ROTH DIRECTED BY MICHAEL KEHLMANN PART 2 Subtitles by Vahlto, 2018.
