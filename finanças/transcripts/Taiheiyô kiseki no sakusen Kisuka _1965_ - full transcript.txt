TOHO MOTION PICTURE CORP. - On some islands in the immense expanse of the Pacific Ocean, once gruesome battles were repeated by Japanese and American forces. The Japanese garrisons confined in isolated islands always followed the same fate of death in action. "Choosing an honorable death rather than surrender" was a cruel and heartless way of fighting a battle that resulted in total annihilation. GUADALCANAL Killed in Action: 24,000 MAKIN, TARAWA Killed in Action: 5,400 KWAJALEIN, ROI-NAMUR Killed in Action: 7,900 SAIPAN, TINIAN Killed in Action: 39,000 GUAM Killed in Action: 19,000 IWO JIMA Killed in Action: 20,100 And at the Aleutian Islands in the Northern Pacific Ocean, Attu island's garrison of 2,400 men chose to die rather than surrender on May 29th, 1943. Attu island's garrison of 2,400 men chose to die rather than surrender on May 29th, 1943. 120 nautical miles to the east, 5,200 soldiers confined on the island of Kiska were waiting for the same impending fate. THE RETREAT FROM KISKA Attention everyone! Attention everyone! The submarine I-7 will be arriving today the last scheduled transport vessel to our homeland, Japan. The passengers from each squad must prepare promptly and assemble at the main beach under the orders of the chief naval surgeon. The cutoff time for posting letters is 14:30. The cutoff time for posting letters is 14:30. Commander, I am going to go around the island to collect the letters to be posted. A senior staff officer is going in person? Yes, sir. This will be the last opportunity. Please take 720 pieces of mail for the North Hill anti-aircraft crews. That's a lot.. Each man wrote about three letters on average. Now we all have nothing to regret. Good. -Please wait! - Yes. Please take this. What is this? They are flower seeds. Will they grow in Japan? -Won't it? -We'll see. Thank you. Anything to post? -We have none. -Why? -They all started but then... There will not be another opportunity. There is still some time. Even if it is just a lock of hair or a fingernail that's still better than nothing. You men should send something to your close relatives. I will wait for it. So hurry. Thank you for your service. A submarine will arrive soon to pick you men up. After returning to Japan, get well as soon as possible. so you can return to the battle line in fine shape. -Kato??? -Yes. I am sorry that I had to amputate your leg. But I was happy that your life was saved. Chief surgeon... What? I am sorry that we are leaving the rest of you. Nonsense. There is a purpose in your return to Japan. The 5,200 of us that remain here in Kiska will choose to fight and die rather than surrender. And who would tell the true facts about Kiska to our homeland? You men will. Only you who are returning on the last boat can do that! A submarine is entering the bay! I wish each of you a safe trip home. Form lines! Dive! Dive! Get back! Get back, everyone! Evacuate! Hurry! This is headquarters. Kurosaki reporting from the observation post. There are about ten enemy ships on the south side. Ohama observation post. About 20 enemy ships to the southeast! Submarine I-7 submerging! Submarine I-7 submerging! Power generator number 1 switching over. The number two power generator is switching over! What happened to the submarine? I hope it is all right. But it may... Let's try sending a radio message. Tell them "It is too dangerous to stay. We wish you good luck". "Turn back." -Yes, sir. Course 080! -Course 080! Course 080! Captain, are we going? We didn't deliver even one bag of rice or a single bullet to Kiska. Radio message from Kiska: "Too dangerous to stay. Turn back." Captain, it is not possible to return now! What did you say? Damn! IMPERIAL HEADQUARTERS NAVAL DIVISION DEPARTMENT OF THE NAVY What is going to happen to Kiska? Attu has already been honorably annihilated. Now, we leave Kiska to the same fate? Kunitomo-kun. Consider the situation. Including two battleships, there is a 30 ship enemy fleet blockading the seas around the island. The enemy is rushing to build an air base on nearby Amchitka island. Soon, they will be flying from Attu as well. Kiska has no strategic value to us. What was the reason for taking Attu and Kiska to begin with? It was a diversion for the Midway operation. Then we should have canceled the Aleutian operation when the Midway operation failed. No. The Aleutian operation had its own justification. It was a big psychological blow to the Americans when we took some of their territory. It was very helpful in raising the morale of our own men as well. But we no longer hold Attu. If we leave Kiska to face its fate alone because we don't see any strategic value, 5,200 soldiers would never be able to rest in peace. It is very difficult emotionally, but our planes and ships are all needed for operations in the south. But Chief, sir... All right, I will tell your our conclusion. At this time of literal life-or-death, we cannot afford to waste any of our fighting strength for such a small island. Chief, we have no other choice. Kiska must become a fortress for the defense of Japan. We can only pray that our soldiers can hang on as long as possible. Kawashima, what do you think? Being in charge of the northern area, I am embarrassed. Since the annihilation of the Attu garrison, the Fifth Fleet's submarines have gone to Kiska a total of 13 times to transport 125 tons of military supplies and 100 tons of provisions. and brought back 820 soldiers. In doing that, we lost five boats and four more boats were damaged. Losses forced us to finally stop the transportation of supplies by submarine. Somehow rescuing the men on Kiska would be extremely difficult. But if nothing is done, our entire garrison will starve to death if the enemy doesn't invade first. Can we let that happen? No, absolutely not! If we leave Kiska to its fate after losing Attu, we will be shamed by future generations. Chief, please let us rescue the men on Kiska. We must use the entire fleet if necessary to rescue the men on Kiska. Please sit down. Kawashima-kun, I will let you do it. I will talk to the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet. Yes, sir. Director! I have taken the post of Chief of Operations for the Fifth Fleet today. So, Kunitomo-kun. I am counting on you. Yes, sir. By the way, send a telegram to Rabaul first. Director, Kiska is to our north. I have business to our south! So the liaison aircraft flew north from Rabaul immediately. The newly appointed commander of the First Torpedo Fleet traveled by changing planes several times from Saipan to Tateyama, through Ominato, then to Paramushiro. The northernmost point in the Kurile Islands - without even knowing his mission. The destiny of the 5,200 man garrison at Kiska had started to change. PARAMUSHIRO BASE IN THE KURILE ISLANDS CRUISER NACHI FLAGSHIP OF THE FIFTH FLEET Omura! Welcome. Come on in. Rear Admiral Shotaro Omura, commanding the First Torpedo Fleet, has arrived. That's enough formality. We were in the same class at the Naval Academy. It is cold. It is. You are an unlucky man to be teamed up with me having graduated the Naval Academy at the bottom of our class. Someone recommended you to command the First Torpedo Fleet. Who was that? It was me. What? You got me posted here? Yes, I wanted you to take a small trip. A small trip? From the southern front all the way up here to the northern front. This is not quite the north end. Will I have to travel further? To Kiska! Fire! Train right, fire! Get down! To the right, fire! The Matsugasaki air-raid shelter had a direct hit. Casualties unknown. An enemy plane was shot down. It crashed into the communications barracks which went up in flames. More enemy planes attacking from the direction of Kurosaki. This is headquarters. Report damage. This is headquarters. -Understood. Fighter planes! They are P-38s. Where did they come from? Either Adak or Amchitka... The enemy's base near Kiska must have been completed. The appearance of fighter planes indicate that they are on the final stages to invade the island of Kiska. We can't wait much longer. "On June 8th, a total of 120 planes..." "June 3rd...Severe naval gunfire." "On May 29th..." "At 7:20 PM that day, we received the last radio signal from the island of Attu." "We are praying for the security of our nation..." "as we order the entire force for the final attack. We will fight to the end with no surrender." I don't want to allow the circumstances where Kiska sends the same message. How about the enemy? They report more than 30 ships, including two battleships, are blockading Kiska. The odds are something like ten to one... And if they have extended their bases to Amchitka, they'll be able to keep watch on an area for 300 miles around Kiska. This make getting our ships there very difficult. Besides, Kiska is a part of American territory. This will not be easy. Have you made any plan yet? Fog.. -Fog? If we use it like a smoke screen to hide our movements, we may be able to sneak in to Kiska. I heard that not even a submarine can get in now. We must sneak in with surface vessels in a single swoop to rescue the men. That is the only way. Under cover of fog? -Yes. The fog is our only ally. But they have radar. Yes, that is a problem. We have experienced enemy bombs and shellfire several times despite the fog. I wonder what they are thinking on Kiska now. They are thinking we are not going to come. That makes it even harder to leave them to a certain death. It's is no good. He does not even understand the gravity of this operation. We have an outrageous man for a commander. And the Director too. Is he serious about this operation? Director, did you know? There is a rumor going around saying that the Fifth Fleet is an "inactive fleet". Yes, I know. Director, please lead the "Kego Operation". You don't feel you can trust Omura? He has no distinguished accomplishments on the battlefield. This operation's purpose is not to attack the enemy. We expressly want to avoid a battle. But when you are really fighting for your life. those men who want to perform great battlefield exploits don't handle it well. He is slow to act, but when he makes decisions, it's the right one. He has always been that way. LIGHT CRUISER ABUKUMA FLAGSHIP OF THE FIRST TORPEDO FLEET. What is your name? Petty Officer Third Class Heihachiro Yamashita! You have a nickname? It is "Commander"! Nice to meet you, "Senior Commander". Yes, sir! Commander, nice to see you, sir. You're here. I've been here three years, sir. I see... All ships of the First Torpedo Fleet are ready to leave port. They are all eager to remove the disgrace attached to our being called the "inactive fleet". There should be more captains here. No, sir. They're all here. Then we need more ships. We need five more destroyers. That is impossible. The entire Combined Fleet has no more than 40 destroyers left. And they are spread out all over this vast Pacific ocean. They don't have any extras to send us. I know this is true. Not enough strength? We have only two cruisers and four destroyers. I will talk to them, but five ships will be too hard to get. What about two ships? No, five ships. Three ships are probably the most I can get. No, five ships! You will accept three ships! You will never get any more than that. If our demands are not met, just raise a white flag up the flagpole. Idiot! That's enough! Men on watch, prepare for a watch change! Men on watch, prepare for a watch change. I see he got mad. He turned red and started to yell. It is good to get mad once in a while. Especially when you are at war. Commander, you've got a bite. Damn! You should be paying more attention. Maybe we should send a radio message to Kiska. Tell them to fight with 'grace' and never surrender... What? Those men on Kiska are not the only ones who would receive that radio message. The nearby soldiers with blue eyes should be listening in carefully as well. THE RESPONSIBILITY OF DEFENDING OUR NATION RESTS HEAVILY ON THE SHOULDERS OF THE GARRISON ON KISKA WE PRAY TO THE FORTUNES OF WAR FOR YOUR BRIGADE. So they are telling us to fight until the very end? Yes, they sent it in the clear with no cipher. So they are not coming for us at all. Praying to the fortunes of war? Of course they are! All right then. How should we respond? On the night of July 15th, the day of the "Bon Festival of the Dead," the entire garrison of Kiska will raid the Fifth Fleet in Paramushiro as ghosts. So be prepared for us. Finish up quickly! The meal will get cold. Ahhh, sorry. It tastes good. Yes! This is really the flavor of life. Squad leader, that is a very tasteful comment. We should eat now. When the fog clears, there will be a lot of bombardment again from the neighbor island. Hey, I will carry that for you. I'm all right. Don't strain yourself. This is the only thing I can do to be helpful to others. When the enemy invades, I will only be a burden to my comrades. Watch out! Get down! Chief Petty Officer Yano! Commander, is the Fifth Fleet really staying at Paramushiro? Why? Our communications engineers caught a message with the words "Operation Kego" from the Combined Fleet to the Fifth Fleet. And? If I remember correctly, for the withdrawal operation at Guadalcanal six months ago, the same words, "Operation Kego", were used. I see. You are right. Then... The fleet is coming to get us? Commander, you must tell this to everyone. No, I shouldn't. If the Combined Fleet were coming with their full strength, I would. But the Fifth Fleet alone won't be enough. Why should we give the men false hope? It would be demoralizing. And I think simply too cruel. Chief surgeon, please keep this to yourself. Then what did you do? In order to avoid enemy radar, we move toward the west side, staying close to the island. But it is too shallow there. We went through it submerged with no problem. It must be at least 20 meters deep. That was reckless. If you had scrapped the bottom, that would have been the end for you. There were a few times that I got scared. Nonetheless, it is amazing you got through such a shallow area. Commander, please let us try it again. We must save face. When the time comes, we will need you to do that again. So the fleet is... We have demanded five more destroyers. It may be impossible but we really need five more ships. We really need six ships! Please reinforce the northern area with these destroyers. What you are asking for is outrageous. This is a modest request. I just could not demand ten ships as Omura had. Please understand how hard it was to knock his demands down. Chief, this is just outrageous. Perhaps, but let's manage it somehow. Chief! But we have to take some of your ships. Big ships are useless for this operation. So will send the Fifth Fleet's cruisers Nachi and Maya to the southern area. Then what would happen to the fleet's headquarters? You'll have to move onto land. They're here; the destroyer reinforcements. Only three ships. No, there's another one. So, four ships... Wait! One more ship. Yes, indeed. Hey, another one. Six ships! This is great. Hurry up! We have to thank the Chief. WE ARE GRATEFUL FOR YOU EFFORTS FLEET HEADQUARTERS WAS MOVED ASHORE FIFTH FLEET HEADQUARTERS Sir, you are the first admiral in Japanese naval history to have ships taken away and having to rent a cannery as headquarters. Probably the first in the world. I can't stand this. Kawashima, you did great. You shouldn't have any complaints. But it was a bad business deal for you. How so? You used two large ships as pawns, so you could have gotten more. Commander, that is indiscreet! -But... -That's all right. Omura, I snatched an imported whiskey from the pawn ship in the red brick building. -Oh! -Let's drink it. That would be great. A crafty man! We shouldn't be silent about it. Captains of all ships are here, sir. Would you introduce yourselves? You can just say the name of your ship. Cruiser Abukuma Cruiser Kiso Destroyer Shimakaze Destroyer Asagumo Destroyer Kuroshio Destroyer Hayashio Destroyer Akigumo Destroyer Usugumo Destroyer Samidare Destroyer Naganami Destroyer Wakaba Destroyer Hatsushimo Escort ship Kunashiri You must have waited for a long time. Commander, you are rude! -Are you mad at me? -Of course, I am. Let's hear about it. You could have showed your appreciation for our Director's efforts to get you those destroyers. Staff officers denounce him as an incompetent Director. Even the officers and crew of the Nachi ridicule him. But he just puts up with them quietly. If you have no sense of gratitude, you are not qualified to command this operation. I think about it differently. If it was out of friendship, or if I try to repay a favor, we would make wrong decisions. We should not be acting on such trifling considerations. We will fail for sure. I will thank him later. But it must wait until we bring back the 5,200 men from Kiska. Commander... I am sorry. Listen everyone! Anyone with grenades, hand them in. I will keep them. Collect them. -Yes, sir -Wait! Don't hand them in! When the enemy invades, would you, sir, personally shoot us? If you refuse, we are not handing in our grenades. How about it? All right, I'll shoot you! But not until the very last minute. If any of you try to waste your life prematurely, you will be in deep trouble. So don't forget it! Understood? Yes. Okay everyone, hand in your grenades. Commander, please give the men some hope. You mean announce the planned withdrawal form Kiska? That is the only way to save them from themselves. As a doctor, it is very hard to see my patients kill themselves after my trying so hard to save them. Please! If there was any possibility of a successful withdrawal, I would. But the island is completely blockaded by enemy ships. How could our fleet get here? They cannot! If that's the case, it is better if the enemy invades the island soon. It would be more pitiful if that happens after we use up all our food and ammunition. Squad leader...? -Huh. Why did he kill himself? If each ship proceeds individually, it should be easy. We can deal with any heavy fog. But all our ships must go in and come out in a very short period of time. in order for us to have the best chance of success. All right, let's all go together then. Abukuma will go first. All the other ships follow in single file. That's the way to do it. We will have to steam for over 100 hours in heavy fog... This is going to be quite a trick. Like 13 blind men walking in a line. If one man stumbles, everyone behind stumbles too. Fleet Staff Officer, any opinions? Each captain must have superb ship-handling skills. Come in. Chief of Communications entering! Radio message from Kiska. Read it. -Yes, sir. "At 09:30 on June 18th, about 50 enemy ships were seen on the horizon." What? -50? That's more than when they invaded Attu. The enemy is getting close to invading. We may not get there in time. Please continue with the agenda. After leaving Paramushiro, the fleet will initially take a diversionary course toward the southeast. But we won't be able to avoid possible enemy submarines lurking in this area. So for three days after leaving port, we must be on guard against enemy submarines. Then, 200 miles southeast of Kiska, at the edge of the enemy's patrol zone, Point Z, we change course and head straight toward Kiska Bay. How much time is needed to embark the soldiers once we arrive? There are no piers there. We will need at least five hours. Fleet Staff Officer, what do you think? Maybe three hours? Impossible. 5,200 men spread all over the island... I think we will need 5-6 hours. Do it in one hour. Once they see us dropping anchors, we can expect enemy planes to be overhead in less than one hour. Nothing is impossible. In order to do that, we need to have a detailed plan worked out in advance with Kiska. Because this is a secret operation, we can't send long radio messages back and forth with each other. Commander. I will go into Kiska beforehand in a submarine. Please let me go. You'd go? -Yes. As soon as they are ready on the island, I will contact you. What would be the code? I will send "Sakura" three times in succession. We will send back "Saita" three times successively. That will be the code for the fleet to leave the port of Paramushiro. READY FOR DEPARTURE Everything thoroughly checked? I have every detail of the operation in my head. We can't have any communications once you leave here. Understood. You must reach Kiska. Yes, sir. Good luck! How are you doing? Submarines get colder than I expected. The water temperature here is close to zero Celsius even in the summertime. It is impossible to swim in it for very long. Once you go into the water, you won't last for more than five minutes. Don't try to scare me. Don't worry. Sixty-eight men and I will do our best to get you there. Captain! You came at just the right time. Chief gunner... -Yes. The success of the Kiska withdrawal falls entirely on Staff Officer Kunitomo's shoulders. Delivering the staff officer here to the island is the only priority for this boat. I am counting on you! -Yes, sir. I understand. You came at the right time. I am working out the strategy now. Would you help? The strategy for the chess game? Please excuse me. Did I make you mad? No, I just worried that you might be distressed. But now I am relieved to see that you're able to relax. Excuse me. Still no contact from Kunitomo? The submarine's expected arrival date at Kiska passed a while ago. Enemy destroyer closing in! Sir, please take a look at this. Today and tomorrow, this area and the route to the destination will have intermittent fog. But on the third day, the high atmospheric pressure will move from the southwest to the Aleutian area. Definite heavy fog. Fortunately for us, the line of discontinuity in the Alaska area will keep the Kiska area in heavy fog for at least a week. I see. This is the best fog forecast we could hope for. Commander, please order the departure. But we have not received any message from the submarine. I am sure we will get one on the way. Will the island be ready on time? They should be able to manage it by the time we get there. We may never have this chance again. If we miss this opportunity, we may never get another. Commander, please make the decision. We shall trust what the learned weatherman says. I am asking you to confirm it, weather chief. You're sure about the fog? Yes, absolutely confident about it! Staff officer, I am sorry for taking so on this journey. So we are delayed two days... The fleet must be waiting impatiently. The fleet will not move until I send the radio message from the island. July 7th However, Omura's fleet left Paramushiro without waiting for the radio message from the submarine. They started moving toward Kiska in the fog. At this rate, we should reach Point Z tomorrow. Then we will not be able to go any further unless we get the message from the submarine. Our fleet is like a mute, blind man now. But keep our ears open. We may get a message from the submarine at any time. July 12th It's Kiska! Are you sure? We're there? Care to? No, I will look at it later from the deck. I will prepare for the landing. Blow the main tank! -Blow the main tank! It seems we finally made it. Captain, the executive officer is down! What? Chief Gunner Ensign Tarawa taking command! The shore is near. Full speed ahead! Control room damaged. We can't pump out water. The boat is going to sink! What? Hurry! We can't go? We're already under water. Rescue party! Hurry! Hurry! Helmsman, go faster! Faster! Stand by for rescue! Go to the torpedo tube. Morse code! To the torpedo room... Open the hatch! Lower the rope. Staff officer, hurry! On my way. Pull! Chief, the engine room is flooded. Hurry! Close hatch number 2! Evacuation complete! Close the hatch! Commander, three successive signals of "Sakura"! So, they made it? That is good. Abukuma and the rest of the fleet are already nearing Kiska. But because this operation must be carried out in absolute secrecy, any direct radio communication is prohibited. Therefore, we can't contact them. And we can't know the day of arrival because it changes depending on the enemy situation and the weather. So it could be today? They sent the signal, "Saita", from Paramushiro five days ago. Then the fleet might arrive at any moment. I will order the brigade to gather immediately. No, only the time of the arrival of the fleet, 16:00, has been determined in advance. It wouldn't hurt to assemble in the men in advance, would it? If the enemy sees the brigade gathering, they will know something's up. The men cannot gather until five minutes before the specified time. It can't be any earlier or later. We must keep to that time. And what do we do if the fleet doesn't show up on time? We stand by for two hours then we would return to our posts. So we can have the hope of returning to Japan for two hours out of 24 hours a day. And for the remaining 22 hours we must keep fighting against the enemy. This may be very hard, but we have to do it this way. The fleet will be here for sure! The fog is thinning. The visibility of 1,000 meters is a little risky. Let's go around one more time and see. Starboard, 10 degrees. -Starboard, 10 degrees. How is our fuel? Nearing the limit. The fleet will anchor 1,000 meters offshore. Prepare 13 boats. If make use of all we have, there will be 15 available. Being too greedy may cause confusion. Keep it simple, one boat per ship. So each boat must repeat the trip three times to transport the 5,200 men. We will have to do it in one hour. One hour? Once the fleet anchors, the ships can't move. If they're seen, enemy planes will be here from Amchitka within one hour. Understood. The brigade clerks will be leaving the island on the cruiser Abukuma's first craft and the destroyer Naganami's second craft. You cannot bring any bulky baggage. At the time of withdrawal, you must be in your blue uniforms, because we don't want to look out of place in case of the worst. We, the anti-aircraft squad, will board the ships in three separate groups. You may forget the names of your wives and children, but you must not forget your number! Chief, what about Taro and Hanako? Only humans are allowed on board. No exceptions. So we're leaving them behind? You are even supposed to throw away your rifle once you get to the ship. There is only one exception - the ashes of our fellow soldiers who died in battle. All of those ashes will be received by us, the medical squad. It is 12 kilometers from here to the gathering place. But we can't leave our post earlier. We depart one hour before the specified time. So we will have to run. That is not a problem. If we are going home then I don't mind running at all. Good! Dismissed! This is great! To Japan! To Japan! It is an irresistible force! Hey...Don't get too optimistic yet. July 16th Radar officer! The fleet! It came? -Take a look. That must be them. Good, transmit the information to all squads. The fleet is 30 miles away, approaching Kiska Bay from the south-southwest. Wait! Wait! You must not leave your post until the specified time. Go back! Go back! Turn around! About face! About face! Stop! Don't move until headquarters gives you the order! Go back! Enemy ship! Take cover! Take cover! Report damage. Report damage. How about that. Rather intense, isn't it? Now you understand my feelings when I told the submarine to turn back. I wanted to tell the fleet not to come either. Don't be taken in by my little joke. The "two hours" out of 24 hours begins soon. The time for hope of returning home. Damn, the horizon is becoming visible! We've come this far. We can't turn back now. We are almost there. Kiska is right in front of us. Commander, let's go in. Wait. Slow ahead! -Slow ahead! -Slow ahead! Shimakaze's captain signals: "Recommend you proceed." Signal from Asagumo. Her captain signals "Recommend you proceed." Every ship is recommending we continue. Commander, all the men on Kiska are gathered and waiting for us. Commander, give us your decision. We are going back. Setting course for Paramushiro. Starboard 30 degrees. -Starboard 30 degrees. If we go back now, we can try again later. Send word to the men on the island? No. We are in the middle of an area controlled by the enemy. No radio signals. Starboard 30 degrees! Aye! Aye! Return. -Return! Return. Let's go back quietly. Omura's fleet turned back even though it was so close to Kiska. They headed back to Paramushiro. The men on Kiska will gather again tomorrow at the beach without knowing the fleet has turned back. They will do that again the day after tomorrow. Hurry! What's the matter? This is ridiculous. It is just a waste of time to go there. Shall we take a cigarette break? Do you have a cigarette? I have saved this one. Damnit! Soggy with sweat! What a waste! I told you. We should not be hoping for the phantom fleet. And we should not be sweating every day for nothing. Idiots! -Yes, sir! Did you forget what I told you? That the entire withdrawal operation may fail because of one goof-off? Prepare, straddle... and clench you teeth! Go! -Yes, sir! Hurry! -Yes, sir! This is an announcement from the commander. According to a radio message from Paramushiro, the fleet gave up on entering Kiska Bay and returned a few days ago. Stop gathering until further notice. I will tell them to return to their posts immediately. Leave them alone for a while. Fleet Staff Officer! What is it? We are sorry. That's all right. No, we realize now that all 5,200 of us are comrades who must share a common fate of life and death. We really regret what we have done. You striking us was not enough. The two of us will keep running to the beach for the gathering every day starting tomorrow. I see. I am glad. The First Torpedo Fleet, including the flagship Abukuma, returned to Paramushiro. Where they waited for another chance for departure. How is the fog? I think there will be more chances through July. We've refueled too. I am sure that there will be another chance to go. What if the enemy invades before we can try again? At my age, I have learned how to pray. Please, Kawashima, pray that the enemy won't invade before we get there. But an American force of 35,000 men had already planned to stage an invasion in just a few days after finishing assembling at their bases in the Aleutian Islands. Hey! Yes, sir. What is the fog outlook? No fogs are in the forecast. If we wait too long, the enemy will invade. But look at this. This next fog will stay for only three days at the most. Report that as five days instead of three. What? We have to push the commander. We can't stand that the First Torpedo Fleet is being ridiculed. We can carry this out. Half from the fog's help and the other half supplied by military spirit! But... That's enough scholar's selfishness. Why are you even wearing a military uniform? Go on! -End of watch in ten minutes. -End of watch in ten minutes. Come in. Ensign Fukumoto coming in. How is it? From 200 miles offshore from Paramushiro to the Aleutians, fog is forming. How long will it last? Well... It will last for three days. I see. You are sure? Yes, sir. Good. Please leave the ship. Your duty has ended. We will do the rest. What's wrong? Commander... The fog won't last for three days. I am sorry. Have you forgotten the scholar's conscience? Have courage. From now on, we will limit the number of artillery shells to three per day for each gun. When we use that up, that will be the end. They will never be replenished. So save as much ammunition as you can to be prepared for the enemy's invasion. That's all. Salute! Their ammunition and provisions are dwindling by the day, why did you turn back? The operation is still in progress. The fleet is in port. The operation is in progress whether they are at sea or in port. It does not matter. Sir! I want you to advise Commander Omura to retire from the service. What? He may have lost his nerve. Idiot! He was saying that he learned to pray for the first time. Go back and report that Omura's fleet is in great shape! I understand that you had a messenger from the General Staff. Yes, the man was quite understanding and said he trusts you. Look at this. A liaison plane delivered this from Tokyo yesterday. "Despite the failure of the Kiska withdrawal operation," "staying on as commander of the First Torpedo Fleet" "is without grace for a reasonable military person." "What do you think?" This is not good. It contradicts what I just said. Come in. Ensign Fukumoto coming in. Commander... This time is for sure. Is that so? According to our measurements, the fog has already formed 100 nautical miles from Paramushiro. July 22 All ahead slow! -All ahead slow! Visibility 300! Visibility 100! Aft lookout to bridge. I can't see the ship astern us. Signal light! -Slightly to right! -Slightly to right. -Starboard Starboard Shall we get closer? No, too dangerous. We'll hit Abukuma's stern. My stern feels endangered too. Shimakaze is following us, isn't she? Signal from the flagship, Abukuma. All ships keep in frequent contact with each other using signal lights. All ships are following us. Slow to six knots. Ahead slow. Ahead slow. After advancing carefully through the fog, the fleet reached Point Z, then it changed course north toward Kiska. Damn, they're really pounding us today! We should shoot all the ammo we have left. At that time, men on Kiska knew that the fleet had left port again. But their hopes for survival had not been renewed. The air raids by American forces intensified more and more each day. Making them believe that the day of invasion was nearing with certainty. July 26th How far away are the enemy ships? 10-20 miles. Attempting even a low-power radio signal would be too dangerous. We'll stop all radio transmissions including ship-to-ship communications. Signal light from Kiso! Position of the Kunashiri is not known. That's not good. It could lead to a collision. When did we lose them? Their last signal - "We are following." - was 15 minutes ago. They cannot be that far away. Try firing a gun. But enemy ships must be near us in this area. If they are within 10 miles, our gunfire may be heard. They have radar. If they can hear us, they would have already found us. This is a gamble. Either the enemy or Kunashiri will appear... Fire a gun. Shall we fire another round? Please stop. It's too dangerous. It's all right. Fire. 20 degrees to starboard, a black object approaching. -That's Kunashiri! -Hard a-port! Hard a-port! -Hard a-port! Watch out! All stop! Check for flooding! Kiso turning starboard. Passing down our right side. Shimakaze is on our left, following behind. Aft lookout to bridge. This is the bridge... Signal from Hatsushimo. "Have collided with Wakaba. Damage minor." "Can continue without difficulty." Commander, crew space in the stern has flooded. It will take one hour for emergency repairs. One hour... Commander! The fog is dense enough to cause us to collide with each other. We will get divine punishment if we complain. But we can't stay as we are. We have no other choice. Any damaged ships need to go back. This ship will stop here for emergency repairs meanwhile... have Kiso take our position and lead the fleet. The meeting point with this ship will be at Point Y, 30 miles south of the southern channel. Depart immediately. Wakaba and Hatsushimo left the fleet as escorts for the damaged Kunashiri and they returned to Paramushiro. The cruiser Kiso took the lead leaving the flagship Abukuma behind. and advanced toward the meeting point in the fog. 40 minutes have already passed. They're using radar. We should fire back blindly. No, that would hinder the repair work. Commander, you don't mind dying this way? Hurry the emergency repairs! Support the plate! How much longer will it take? About 15 minutes. Is there any other damage? No, there isn't! Hurry! Is the repair finished yet? Aft crew space repair finished? The repair is completed. Good. Let's get out of here and leave the enemy behind. Full ahead! Captain, how much longer do we wait for Abukuma? We've been waiting for three hours. If the fog clears, we will have failed again. We can't try again later. We will forever lose the chance to rescue the men of Kiska. Captain, please take command of the withdrawal operation! Very well. Proceed to Kiska Bay! Enemy ship 30 degrees port side. Prepare for gun and torpedo attack port side. Wait! It's Abukuma. TO ALL SHIPS FOLLOW US From this point on, we will follow the Abukuma. Full ahead! -Full ahead! Who is that? Ah, still awake? I've been feeling uneasy. This is a very heavy fog. The captains must be having a difficult time. Sir, please send a radio message. We can guide the fleet using our radar. Won't it invite enemy ships in? That is a danger. But it is impossible for our fleet to find us in this fog. The fleet may be searching for the entrance into Kiska. They could be just offshore, very close to here... Very well. July 28th Course 320 degrees, Kiska Bay. Understood. We received a radio signal from Kiska. Course 320 degrees. Kiska Bay. How far? About 20 miles. It will be easy if we just follow the radio signal. But sending radio signals means... Commander, please increase speed. Maintain current speed. But if we keep the same speed, we will not get in until night. 5,200 men will be waiting at the beach on Kiska today for sure. Please go straight in. If the enemy already knows we are in the area, they may be setting up an ambush... Kiska Bay is the only entry point. There is only one way to get there. We can go around to the west... What? If we proceed north, staying very close to the shore, enemy radar won't be able to detect us. That is too risky. Our charts for that channel are not very good. The tide is fast here and there are extensive shallows. No one has gone through there. Wrong, there is a man who went through it with only one eye watching through a periscope. The captain of submarine I-7. But it will be suicidal for our fleet to form one line. If we go around to the west, we will face the unknown dangers of that channel. But if we keep going straight, we may not encounter the enemy. All ships stand by at this position. What? Are we going to stop? Let's wait and see for a while. Commander, it is only two hours away. We're almost to Kiska Bay. Please go in. All stop. -All stop! 10 degrees to starboard, enemy ship! Execute torpedo attack starboard side. Island. Commander, it is an island. What was that? What was that sound? If the enemy heard that explosion, they may have determined our location. Commander, that is a distinct possibility. Men on the island will have to wait for one more day. The fleet will circle west. Commander, there must be a battle between the two fleets. Fleet Staff Officer, what do you think? It was a mistake to have forced your to send the radio signal. I am afraid that our fleet followed the radio signal to advance north and then were ambushed by an enemy fleet. Now we can't expect the withdrawal operation of Kiska anymore. We must give up any hope of returning home alive and renew our preparations for our final battle without surrendering. Please announce that to every man. The commander has an announcement! Right now, our fleet seems to be engaged in a gunnery battle against the enemy to the southwest. There no longer seems to be any hope of withdrawal. But despite the difficult war situation, a precious fleet was twice sent for us. We must deeply thank the homeland, Japan, and all those who engaged in the withdrawal operation. Sir, we have received a radio message from Kiska. Read it. "On July 28th, from 17:30 for three hours," "sounds of gunfire were heard on the sea southeast of Kiska." What? It seems that our fleet encountered an enemy fleet. Is that right... But around that time, Omura's undamaged fleet was advancing north through the uncharted waters west of Kiska. The sounds of gunfire were the enemy's blind attack on a misidentified, phantom fleet. It is strange that they heard gunfire for three hours at Kiska. The enemy must also be on edge. They may have misidentified the radar reflection of an island as a Japanese fleet. We misidentified an island as a ship ourselves. Commander, the decision to circle around west was brilliant. Well, it will get more difficult from here. Please steer away from the land a little. No, if they see us on radar that will be the end. The enemy would not make the same mistake again. We must get even closer. Over there! Closer! Starboard. -Starboard 18... 17... Too shallow! The distance to the rocks is 70! Port! -Port! Captain, the tide is fast. Don't let it push us over. Starboard, rocks near! Getting closer. Distancing 40... 35... Starboard helm! Port engine, half speed. -Starboard helm! -Port engine, half speed. We're clear. Steady! All ahead slow! Bow lookout to bridge. The fog is getting heavier. Visibility 100. Other ships all right? Watch Officer! Port engine, ahead slow! -Port engine, ahead slow -Starboard. Starboard! Helm, starboard! Captain, we can't control the rudder! What... I see. Steady! -Steady! Chief Engineer, what happened? Stern lookout to bridge. Tide is fast and unstable. Helm, don't swing the stern and steady the rudder. Captain, let me take over. All ahead full! Full speed, commander? It is the only way to get across. Starboard! -Starboard! Are the other ships following? Yes, they are. A patrol boat is leaving the mouth of the bay. That is odd. They may be joining with the fleet from last night. It is a new enemy fleet. What? They are going south from the northeast. How many? 8-10 ships. They are bringing in more ships. They may try bombarding our shore batteries. This is the present situation. The enemy fleet is going south toward the east. Each lookout post keep a close watch. Chief, isn't that an engine sound? This is the Matsugasaki lookout post. We can hear a ship's engine sound. Ah! Bugle! -Ah! Bugle That's the bugle call for entering port. The fleet! The fleet! End radio silence. Send this message... "Entering bay four hours early." Hurry! Hurry! We may not be there in time if we are too slow. You will have stomach problems if you eat this all at once. Eat sparingly so that it will last for a long time. Run away from any bombs. Ah...Ship! They are gathered! There is another one... Squad leader, there are four ships now. Is that right? Five ships! All stop! -All stop! Drop anchor. All boats! Start engines! Get on board! -Get on board! Keep a look out for aircraft and submarines. Throw away your rifles! Hurry and get on board! Pull them in! Hey! Anyone still here? Anyone still here? Salute! You're still here?! At the present time, 12:40, it seems there are no enemy ships near Kiska. Let's go! Let's go! Everyone accounted for! Good. Thank you. The last boat just left the island. Commander, the withdrawal has been completed. It has been only 55 minutes since dropping anchor. Good. Let's get out of here. Prepare to get underway! Start moving slowly. All ahead slow! -All ahead slow! Commander... Akitani-san, I appreciate you long service at the island. Thank you. Kiska's garrison, 5,183 men, are... That is all of them, right? Yes, sir. Plus the ashes of 115 are with us. Staff Officer Kunitomo... Thank you. Increase to standard speed two. Full ahead. -Full ahead. ON JULY 29th, 1943, THE FLEET INCLUDING ABUKUMA HEADED FOR PARAMUSHIRO AFTER RESCUING 5,200 MEN OF THE KISKA GARRISON ABOUT TWO WEEKS LATER, AMERICAN FORCES CARRIED OUT THEIR INVASION WITH 35,000 MEN AND THE SUPPORT OF 100 SHIPS. THEY FOUND NO JAPANESE FORCES EXCEPT FOR TWO DOGS AFTER BOMBARDING THE ISLAND FOR TWO DAYS AND NIGHTS. The End.
