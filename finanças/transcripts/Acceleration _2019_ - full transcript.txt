Let's do this. Let's see what we got here. The fuck is this? In this business, there is no room for mistakes. Any wrong turn, and innocent people can pay the price. These streets and five tasks stand between me and seeing my son again. Get the money and find the guns, or I'm a dead man. We're on it, Jimmie. Hey, you! Stop! David? We still good to meet? I can't talk right now. I'm, um... I'm busy. I'll meet you at our spot. Rhona. Can I get you anything? Water, coffee, and privacy. Sure thing. She's, uh... she's not eating? No, she's just taking up a table. Anything else? Privacy. That'll be 3.50. I was never here. Refills on me. Enjoying your coffee? I wanna speak to my son. Not the agreement. We made an agreement? Complete all your assignments, you not only get to speak to him, you'll have the pleasure of holding him. How do I know... How do I know you haven't already killed him? You don't. Fuck. This place is dangerous. Buck up. Where the hell is Richie? Well, Richie is... Richie's late, but he'll be here. If you two fuck this up, this won't end well. Understood? Yeah. Yeah, I understand. Good. I need this money to get Mika out of here. You must love your son. Yeah, I do. Imagine that. There's Richie right there. Told you. Stay in the fucking car. I'm serious, not a sound. Richie, you're late. Let's do this. He wants to see the money. Let's see the product first. What's wrong with you? Are you high? No! Let's do this. Just show it to him, okay? Look, just... just get the bag and show him the money. Richie! Tell him to get on the ground! What the hell is happening? Wait, what the hell are you doing? Get on the ground! No, what are you... I know you said you weren't here, but, uh, the coffee cup is. I'll probably regret asking this, but are you all right? Allergies. I don't know their names, but they're not worth it. You'd best go it alone, they give you any difficulty at all. They won't see the next sunrise. Evening, Betty. Well, it's a quiet one at that, isn't it? Your powers of observation are astounding. How's the yellow-white pie tonight, it's good? Yeah, the lemon meringue's fresh. Good. Gimme a slice? Actually, Betty, make it two, will ya? Kane. That's your car out front. Am I right? It is tonight. Here you go. Oh, Betty, you're a queen. - Beautiful, thank you, sweetie. - Thank you. You're gonna love this. This... this is another level. That's beautiful. You know, it always tastes exactly the same, too. They call that "integrity." It's like the recipe never wavers, not once, you know? It's always the same. It's the culinary equivalent of loyalty, I guess. It's like all the ingredients show up every single time they're called, in exactly the right amounts. That's what makes it so pure and perfect. You know what I mean? It's beautiful, right? What's the matter, Rhona, you don't... you don't eat pie? You know, if you don't take it, somebody will. Mm. Not even a taste, huh? Tiny little taste, tip of your tongue? Later. Well, then, you won't mind if I take it, will ya? Betty, can we get this, uh, to go, sweetie? - Okay. - Thank you, darlin'. You know what I could do for you... and I'd be willing... I can swing by your place and deliver that pie to you, any way you want it. Mm. Wherever you want it delivered, however many times you want it delivered. That's all right, thank you. You wouldn't wanna wreck that beautiful chassis of yours, would you? I don't imagine that delicious ass got that way by eating pie, am I right? You know what I like best about you, Rhona? You never once asked me to cuddle. It was just straight to business with you, all business, all day. And I fucking respect that. I don't like to cuddle. - Of course not. - Here you go. Thank you, Betty. You're a queen, darlin'. Listen to me, I want you to be careful out there, all right? There's a lot of machine under your right foot. - Don't get too heavy on it. - Mm. You don't want the back end stepping out, opposite lock. That's where the danger happens, right? Thank you. Mm. You be good, huh? Either one of you boys seen this guy? I'm fine, how are you? I don't care much how you are. Have you seen him or not? It's polite to say, "Excuse me, can you help me?" He's putting his phone away. What are you gonna do, try something? Get outta here, man. There's nothing here for you. Who you looking for? This guy. You know him? Oh, Richie. I know that guy. He hangs out with this other guy named Dominic. Usually they're at the diner this time of night. Thank you very much. Oh... sorry about the mess. Oh, shit! Hey! Hey... hey, hey, hey, hey, lady, lady. I'm just looking for a few extra bucks. You got something? What? Do you think you can alter the rules? Is that what I think? Don't at any time believe you have control of the situation, ever. I just stopped for a cup of coffee. You have four more envelopes, five hours, 21 minutes, and nine seconds to work with. Dominic, Dominic, Dominic. How you doing, buddy? - Pretty good? - Yeah. - Look at that. - Yeah, how you been? I been good. You? - Yeah, okay. - Have a seat. Hey, I'm all right. Yeah? Just talk to me. What have you been up to? I ain't been doing nothing. Do not lie, Dominic. You know, it's only gonna be worse for you. Dominic, Dominic. This must be some mistaken situation, because I ain't been doing nothing. I swear, Kane, nothing. So you, uh... you... you're saying I make mistakes? That what you're saying? I ain't saying that, I... You just fucking said it. You said I make mistakes. That's what you said. Well, I didn't mean to say that. No disrespect, Kane. I'm just... Where can I find Richie, Dominic? - Richie? - Richie, your boy. Oh, you hang out with Richie, swap needles. I don't know, maybe you touch fucking dongs, I don't know. Where the fuck can I find Richie? - Where can I find him? - Oh, Richie. - Oh, oh, oh... - Richie. - Richie. - Oh, yeah, Richie, oh... Yeah, fucking Richie, eh? Richie, I... I mean, I haven't seen Richie in a while. What's "a while?" What exactly is a while? Is that, like... is that like a week, a... a month, a fucking millennia? What's a... what... what... what's... what's a while? I don't know, Kane. I don't know, maybe four days? Four days! We're gonna go with four days for a while. I like that. I'm gonna go with four days for a while. Okay. - So four days ago, where'd you see Richie, exactly? Maybe the... the track, or... or the laundromat, the diner. You know, around, around, like you do, yeah. Around. Around, yeah, yeah. I'm gonna need a drink... a round. You know what we're gonna do? We're gonna play a game. You think we should do the cigar box? Yeah, grab me the cigar box. You like games? Yeah. You're gonna love this. Look at this. So you and I... We're gonna do a little bang-bang, okay? You go three clicks, and I go three clicks. You do three clicks, you fucking walk outta here, right? I mean, unless I fucking blow my brains out. Sound good to you, Dominic? Look, Kane... I swear to you I ain't seen Richie, okay? Now, I ain't been doing nothing, and I don't wanna do this. You know what, you know what, Dominic, okay, I'm gonna give you a choice here. You can play the game with me, or you could tell me where the fuck I can find Richie. I don't know where Richie is. Or you can do a dance with my boy here. But unfortunately, he's probably not gonna let you leave, and he loves to fucking grab ass. Kane, don't make me do this, man. You gotta believe me, I'm telling you. What's it gonna be, Dom? I don't know where Richie is. Don't make me do this. Don't make me do this. Oh, Dom, I swear to god I thought... Fuck you, Kane! Fuck you! I fucking believe you. I still believe you. Dom, I believe you. Dom, I believe you. Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Hey, hey... I believe you, buddy. I believe you, buddy. I believe you're gonna do it. You did, you pulled that trigger, didn't you? Fucking Dominic pulled that trigger. Have a seat. Have a seat. Sit down. Look at me. Look at me, look at me. - You think I'm fucking stupid? - Oh! Pick your fucking head up and look at me. Pick your fucking head up! Dom, look at me! This is when the game starts... right now. But here's the good news. That's one. Now it's my turn. Okay? It's my turn. You ready for this? It's my turn. Are you ready? Look at me. Open your eyes, Dom! Don't you fucking take your eyes off of me. Look at me! Dom! Goddamn it... - No, I can't. - ...you fucking open your eyes. - No! No! - Look! Look! You wanna see this, motherfucker. - No! - You wanna see it? Ah! You're up. Two more clicks, and you walk. - I can't. - Yeah, you can. - I can't! - Look at me, Dom. - You know what I'm gonna do? - I can't do it. Would you help him? Give him air, help him out. My girl is gonna help you out, Dom. - I can't. - It's okay, it's okay. I can't. It's gonna be all right. Atta boy. I don't want to. Maybe nobody believed in you when you were a kid. I fucking believe in you, Dom. You can do this. I believe in you, buddy. You're not a fucking... are you a fucking pussy? Not the Dom I know! I believe in you, buddy. Dom, pull it. Pull it, motherfucker. Do it. Do it. Fucking do it, Dom. Pull it! Oh, fucking shit! Is that blood on my pool table? Wipe that shit off, would you? I don't give a fuck. I don't want fucking loser DNA in my house. Are you going to let me go now? Soon. Why are you doing this? I have no choice. My mother says we always have a choice. Did she also tell you you have to live with the consequences? Yeah. A couple of years, this will be a story you'll tell your friends. Eat your sandwich. You'll see your mom soon. Bullshit. No, I'm not... I'm not doing this. Fuck you. Did you hear me? Fuck you. Fucking asshole! The kid's not here, Rhona. You know I still have to look. And you know I can't just let you do that. That would be a real shame. Tell you what. I'm gonna go take a smoke break. I'm gonna be back in 10 minutes exactly. Cigarettes are bad for you. Yeah. So is life. Hey. I hope you find him. Hey. Your kid ain't here. Then where? Even if I knew, I couldn't say. Look, you're going about this all wrong. I am not your enemy. Everyone is the enemy tonight. I understand that, but nothing positive will come from you aiming your weapon at me. - I'm willing to find out. - Well, I'd prefer we didn't. So if you will... Very kind of you. Hey, despite what you may believe, we have a code. Family is strictly off-limits. Vladik crossed that line, and he will be dealt with. Doubtful. I assure you, he will be. I know you have mutual business with Vladik. Hey, hey, that ain't none of your business. You lie. We've known one another for a very long time. Don't play me. I would never do such a thing. Do you know where my son is or not? I truly don't. And if you knew... would you tell me? That would be a question. That is the question. Like I said. If anything happens to Mika, if he dies... I know, I know: you'll come for me. Go in peace. What is it? You won't find answers in our safehouses. I suggest you use your time wisely. Well, I want proof of life. Do the job and you get your son back. Au revoir. Yeah, okay, I'll take care of it. Yes, I got her. Let me speak to my son. Must we have this conversation every time we speak? What, am I being annoying, hm? Because I want to talk to my son? Perhaps after your next assignment, as a sign of good faith I'll give you a moment with Mika. This is all just a game to you, isn't it? 3:31 a.m. Look... You got enough to eat? Why are you worried about my diet? I'm not worried. I just wanna make sure you get fed. Does he talk? - Ask him. - Do you talk? I guess not. He's a thinker. Where's my mom? She's running an errand for me. What kind of errand? Nothing for you to be concerned about. Why? Because it's illegal? What makes you think it's illegal? I'm pretty sure you guys don't have normal jobs. We work all the same. It's just our hours are a little different. Then why does he have a gun? It's for your safety. That's something a cop would say. You got a problem with cops? I guess they're okay. My mom says to never trust a cop or a lawyer. Says they're always looking for ways to take you down. Well, you can add priests to that list, too. And car salesmen. Just... just get some rest, okay? You really don't talk? Jimmie. We were wondering when you'd surface. Where are the guns? I, uh... I didn't know what to do, man. You were supposed to hijack Vladik's shipment, and yet, no guns. Listen, I gotta speak with Kane. I know he's back there, so sh-sh-sh-shush. Outta my way, I'm not afraid of you. Jimmie, why would you say that? That's a good question, and I'm glad you asked. Because you don't control me when I'm holding a gun. What are you gonna do with it, Jimmie? Whatever I want, man. Whatever I need to do. Whoa, hey! Okay, well, let's put our guns down, Jimmie, and we can talk about it. Yeah, let's talk about this. You hang out while I'm boots on the ground slaving, earning, so that Kane can have all this... this fancy shit. This, right here. This fancy... huh? You shouldn't do that, Jimmie. Why don't you back up? Okay, Jimmie. Why you keep saying my name, man? Stop saying my fucking name. Why, Jimmie? You don't like your name, Jimmie? It's messing with my head. I don't like that. I understand. Oh, you understand, Hannibal? You're one of those understanding... Hah! The Russian, he was fucking... he was stalling, man. And the whole deal, it went sideways. I didn't know it would go down like this. I mean, I like you, and I don't wanna have to shoot you in your fucking pretty face. I need to speak with Kane, because I just... I just need him to know. I just... Shit. Hey, Rhona. Tony. How's it going? Good. This a social visit? Up to her. All right. I'll follow you. I see you, a gun, a late-night visit, and I assume, with you, problems. Too many to count. Why are you here? The cash. I made a cash deal to keep the peace, and now he sends you to what, take it back? I'm asking, please. Then why the gun? Doesn't seem to me like asking. Insurance. Well, insurance has a price. I keep the cash. Now, off you go. She'll be back. Take care. - Yeah? - It's me. What's up? We found Richie. He's pushing snow to Santos' men tonight. Grab Hannibal and the boys, and go fetch him, huh? Alive. That'd be up to him A-live. He said he wants to see us at 4:00 p.m. - Is that good? - Let's do 5:00. It's too early. No, I don't wanna do 5:00, so we'll do 7:00 p.m. 7:00 p.m.'s fine. Do you wanna just go right now instead? No, I don't wanna do right now. We'll do 9:00 p.m. 9:00 p.m. it is, works for me. I'll do 9:00 p.m. Richie? Richie? - Richie. - What? Company. Oh, hey, fellas. What a surprise. For you, or for us, Richie? I was, uh, coincidentally, uh, just... just thinking about you guys. Sure you were. It's time to take a ride. Oh, you know, I appreciate it, but, uh, look, I got a lotta work to do here. So I'm... I'll catch up with you guys later, hm? It's not an invitation. Wait, no, hold on. Guys, guys. We've got company, Santos' men. No, no! Let me go! My son. We've been through this, you know the rules. Take out each target associated with the numbered envelope. Acquire my items, put the items in the bag. Then, and only then, will you see your son. I mean, what part of this doesn't register in your grey matter? I want to speak with my child, now. You wanna speak to your child? Yes. Start by giving me fire. I want to speak with Mika, that's all. You heard me. Fuck. This is Ling's. - Order for delivery. - Go ahead. Number 11, with two fortune cookies. And a hot tea. Any pie to go with that? No. We'll be there soon. What is it? Use your time wisely. You've barely begun. It's getting late. Tick-tock. Hello, Santos. And to what do I owe the pleasure of this visit? I want you to give me the drive. Hah. This should get interesting. And why would I do that? Because it's in everyone's best interest. Everyone's? Yours. Not my best angle. And not my choice. Whose, then? You know. Yes, I do. The easy way would be best. For you. For everyone. Yeah, perhaps, perhaps not. You and I go back a long way. Yeah, we do. - Eighteen years. - Sixteen. Are you correcting me? Reminding you. Hm. Word has it you're on a quest. I'd rather not be. You know, quests can be life-changing. This could be life-ending. We don't want that, now, do we? No, we don't. And, uh, you think I can help you? I could just take it. Honest... that's what I've always liked about you. I don't have time to play. Flaco. You and I have never had a problem. Not yet, we haven't. You always kept things on a professional level, never personal. When I could. You did it right. That's what people remember: that you can be relied on. I'm not here for you. That's good to hear. You know... I made copies. I know. You know, you could have just taken me out. Sixteen years. I can just finish her off. Nah. Sixteen years. Hm. Rain. Chiko. How was the pie with Kane? I try to avoid sugar. Number 11, just as you requested. - Happy? - Always. All right, let's do this. All right. So, how's it fit? Like a prom dress. You got the guns. Take this as a receipt. Good luck, Rhona. Ah! Well done. Where's Mika? Oh, how should I know? Last chance. Oh... Oh. You took a round. More than you can say. You should never take a round. I trained you better than that. It's getting late. Wakey, wakey, eggs and bacey. Where are my guns, Richie? Where they at? Hey, buddy. You don't think I'd forget about you, do you? Richie, stay with us. Now, see, I know you had a meeting with Jack the Flower, right? What'd you talk to Jack about? What are you talking about? I don't... I never met with Jack, not even one time. - Is that right? - Yeah. - Not one? - I'm telling the truth. I wouldn't lie to you, man. Yeah, you wouldn't... you wouldn't fucking lie to me. I'm telling the truth. I wouldn't lie to you, man. Yeah. I might be crazy, but I'm not stupid. Not at all? Not even a little fucking lie? No! No. All right. Show him, huh? Now see, Richie, do you really think you could do something like that and get away with it? I don't know when that... You really think you could pull off something like that, and me not find out about it? I don't know... I don't know when that... I don't know when that was. I... I don't know when that... You don't know what I'm talking about? - No. - Not at all? No. Give him one. Oh, shit! Richie, Richie! - You know now, buddy? - Yeah, I do. - You know now? - I do, I do, yes. Huh? You know what I'm talking about? Yes, yes. I ran into him at a bar. I just ran into him at a bar. - Is that right? - Yeah. So you don't know nothing, huh? I don't know anything. If I don't know anything, how could I tell him anything, right? I gotcha. So, ignorance, that's your defense? Yeah. It really was just happenstance, wasn't it? Yeah, yeah. It was just... it was just dumb luck. Fucking dumb luck, which is really fucking dumb luck. - Really... - Like, so fucking dumb. - Oh, fuck. - Really bad. Richie, I got... here's the only question I have. What the... what the fuck do I do with you? I'll do anything for you, Kane. Anything you need. Because I'm feeling fucking magnanimous. Magnanimous. Generous, Richie. Fuck, keep up. - Oh... okay. - Really generous, like... You'll let me go, then? Yeah. Yeah, Richie. I can do that, buddy. I guess I just need you to do me one favor. Anything. Anything, Kane. - Yeah? - Anything. Don't beg. - What? - That shit fucking disgusts me. Where you going? Where you going? Where you going? - Why are you here? - Please, can you help us? - Shh! - Can you help us? Shit! Shit, shit, shit. Here... have you seen this boy? Look. - Yes, yes. - What? - Yes, I have. - When? Where? Yesterday, in the office. Okay. Okay, okay, okay. Shh. Hold on. This will do. Okay. Be quiet. Go, go, go, go! Wait, wait, wait. Here, take this. - No, no, no. - Yes! Split it up and get outta here. There's a door right there, you... you... Get outside, and you run. - Thank you. - Go! Go! Oh! Apologies for the tardiness, but, uh, I did bring pie. So tell me, how's that reimbursement program coming along, good? I'm working on it. You're working on it, huh? Like, uh, in the practical, or more like the abstract? - Reality. - Reality. Yeah, because, see, my reality is I don't get my money by 7:00 a.m., I'm planning a poor man's funeral. You know what a poor man's funeral is? Yeah, I got my suspicions. It's your funeral. I mean, don't get me wrong. I mean, still gonna have some bells and whistles for you. You know, crying hookers, shit like that. But it's yours. So, you know, word on the street is you got Rhona making laundry runs for you. That right? Couple items needed cleaning up, yeah. Oh. So be honest with me. That why you took the kid? Some people need more motivating than others. Right. I don't imagine she's gonna be doing any laundry stops at my place. Am I right? Not unless you spill your milk. See, now you got me curious. Because I usually never spill milk. I'm sure. Well, I guess it's that time, right? - Bring him out. - Ricky. Hey, take it easy on him. What, are you going soft on me? Come on, it's like you said on the phone, this is just an insurance policy, nothing more. Just a kid. He's gonna be safe like he's in his mama's arms, sucking on that nice, perky tit. Isn't that right? Well, I appreciate the hospitality. Any time. Any time? Any time? I come here any time I want, right? Holy shit. Don't forget, I paid for this shit. Look at that. Nothing. Just like I thought. 7:00 a.m. Hello, Rhona. This look actually suits you. You interfere in my business. You free my product. You affect my income. I take exception on this. It was you that hijacked Vladik's deal, wasn't it? The gun deal, am I right? Well, it had to be. It couldn't be that imbecile, Richie. He can't even find his shoes when they're on his feet. That was you. Just give me the ledger, and we'll all go home tonight. Just give you the ledger. Sure, I'll just, I'll just give you my ledger. Andre, this, this woman is very funny, isn't she? Mm. Yeah, I'll just give you the ledger. You free my product, and you have the balls to make demands on me? You, you are something. I know exactly why you're here. I know who sent you. And you, you little Judas, you took that money, didn't you? Oh! I find that to be very audacious. You own a toothbrush? Games. Games, Andre, they always have to play games, right? You're risking your life, and you don't even understand the big picture. Here. Here's the ledger. It's all here. Oh, oh, let's... let's not tempt fate. Every deal I ever made is right in this ledger. What can I say? Call me old-school. And what really fascinates me is that he sent you to get this ledger, and you agreed without hesitation. And kill you. Oh, to kill me. Wow. So, here's what I'm gonna do. You cost me a lot of money when you freed my product. And, uh, you still look like you have a few good rides in you, right? So I'm gonna ply my boys up with Sildenafil, and I'm gonna give you to them, so they could have their way with you for as long as they want. And when they bore of you, in about a year, I'm gonna sell you at a very deep discount to the Eastern European mongrels, and maybe I'll get a little bit back of what I lost. Or, we make a deal, and you avoid a slow, painful death. You got nothing I want or need. He'll send someone else. Or better yet, come himself. Oh, Vladik. Vladik and I, suffice it to say, we've been doing this dance a long, long time, you know? He's my personal Sisyphus. You know who Sisyphus is? Do you? Good. You know, up and down, up and down. And of course, he absolutely despises my skin trade business. But the Rhodes Scholar Richie explained to me the only reason Vladik really wants to eliminate me and Kane is so he could expand his own empire. There's nothing new here. It's really cliché. You know, long live the king, that B.S. So, my love... You get some rest. You're gonna be wishing for it when my... when my boys get a hold of you. Mm. Andre. Oh, that's nice, that's nice. Turn around. Uh-huh. Now bend over, bend over. Put... put your butt more to me. Now look this way. Oh, that's great. Okay, arch your back, now. Arch your back. Come on, show me your tits, put them over here. Come on, stick your... Stick your boobs out. Take your arms and put them together. Make them look bigger. Yeah, arch your back, look right here... Oh, that's nice. Oh, they're gonna love you in Serbia. - Mm. - Yeah, smile. Come on, look like you're having a great time. That's nice. Yeah. Excellent. Okay, now look at me, look at me. Arch your... keep arching your back. Oh, that's good. Bitch! What is it? Open the glove box. Had I wanted to kill you, you would have been dead already. If you seek answers, open the glove box. Fine! More games? Now the envelope. Mika's at your place? Bring me my bag. Where is Mika? Gimme the case. Mika first. He's not here. You said he was here. No, I said bring me my things. - You lied? - And you stole. Where's my son? Where's Mika? He's with Kane. What? Why? Because I owe Kane a lot of money. More than you stole. He forced my hand. I had no choice but to manipulate you. So you let him take our son? A son I've never known. Because I didn't want him to be anywhere near this life. Because he is innocent. He's pure. He's the exact opposite of what we are, don't you understand that? He's the one thing that you gave me that I'm actually grateful for. So yes, I saw the opportunity, and I took the money and your guns, because I wanted him to be as far away from this place and... And me? Yes, and you. What we had was about us. - Now it's about Mika. - I know. And that's the only thing that matters. If I don't get that money to Kane by 7:00, our son is dead. Then help me get our son back. Vladik, for old times. Thank you. Let's do this. Oh, shit! Look at that. If it ain't the fucking king and queen of the prom, back together again, look at that. Well, I guess I know what side you've chosen, then, right? - Where's my son? - Where's my fucking bag? The kid first. Get the kid. You son of a bitch, get him out of the cage, now. Let him out. I gotta thank you, Rhona, for taking care of my dirty laundry. I appreciate it. Couldn't have done it myself. And you, you got something for me? Yeah. This is how it's gonna play out. She'll go get the bag. You give us the kid. Oh, that's how it's gonna play out. You fucking hear him, Rhona? Move! Go get the bag. You know, I gotta... I gotta be honest with you. Initially, I didn't see the resemblance at all. Now, I mean, it's there, clean as day, right? You squirted that outta your dick, didn't ya? I had no fucking idea. Hell of a mom, though, Jesus. Whew, good score on that. Lucky sperm club, that kid, huh? Is it gonna hurt your feelings if I tell you that I'd threw a leg over that? Would it? Yeah, buddy. Just know, I planted my flag on the fucking moon, and you're a cosmonaut. That feel good? So how was the pie? Oh, the pie, the pie was fucking Entenmann: creamy, delicious. Fucking Entenmann. Okay. Let's go. That's far enough. Right there on the table. Ricky. How we doing, Ricky? We're good. Right here. Let the kid go. Let's see what we got here. What the fuck is this? Shit! Get the kid! Oh! Ugh! Dad! Ah! Hey, kid... Why don't you go see your mom, huh? Atta boy. Baby, are you okay? Are you okay? Good. It's only ever been about you and me, right? Go, get outta here. Get outta here, take care of him. Go! So tell me, buddy, how you see this playing out, huh? I don't know. What do you think? I don't know. Maybe it's time for some of those crying hookers, though, eh? Maybe it's just a poor man's funeral. Come on. Your money's been deposited, Banco de Mexico, Calle Monte de Herales 602, Lomas de Chapultepec, Box 020232060832. Send me a postcard. David? Thank you. Be safe. Like I said, in this business, there is no room for mistakes. Aside from a few bumps in the road, my plan worked perfectly. I kept the money, sold the guns, and I got my son back. Now it's time to step on the gas and start a new life.
