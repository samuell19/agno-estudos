An emotion or something. anger, sadness... ...and then we would throw it into the ocean as this way of releasing things we didn't want I like that. Did you ever do it for things that you did want? Yes, occasionally we would... make a wish But it was really special because my mom is just so practical in so many ways So whenever we did that it was... ...it felt like something magical might happen. I didn't really have anything magical like that growing up. I did have this disappering mom though and this really cool key I wore around my neck If I used it... ...I could open my front door. Magic rocks sound a lot nicer. Yeah. I coulda' used some of those when I was a kid. Mommy! Hello How you doing? Good. Yeah?

But you gotta prepare an old woman before you drop something big off in her lap. You asked. And you're not old. Thank you. This is why you've been so secretive? 'Cuz I'm sleeping with a woman? Yeah it's just not something I ever saw myself doing. It's just... Just so much stuff that goes along with that, you know? Like now I, now I suddenly have a label. Black, white, straight, gay. There's nothing wrong with being gay. I know that. But you know, a lot of other people don't. Girl this is New York. Yeah Call my parents, they live in Brooklyn. Besides I'm not gay. I still, I still like men I do. I'm just... I don't know. Once upon a time what feels like a lifetime ago I was in love with a white man. And he loved me. I wanted to spend my every waking hour with him To spend my life with him. But back then where I was at it would have taken courage I didn't have support from family, friends, peers to walk down the street hand in hand without having insults hurled at us So what happened? I closed my heart to him. to that entire part of my life. I don't regret where I'm at, my family my choices for any second, but... that is one regret that still hangs over me and living with regret is only my doing. I feel like when I close my eyes I keep thinking that if the world didn't care I wouldn't care. If the world didn't care, I wouldn't care. Life is a series of choices Amber. Every second we choose our happiness or our bitter remorse. And we can only love who we love and stand by that choice Times are changin' baby. Times are changing. So... ...step into your life before it passes you by. Oww. Logan we are just so happy that Amber has found a friend like you during such a difficult time in her life. And we really appreciate you being there for her. It's my absolute pleasure. She's wonderful. Nice to finally meet you. Nice to put a pretty face to someone we've heard so much about. Thank you. Great to meet you both. I actually have to get going, I have a client to meet. I'm sorry. But please enjoy the rest of your day Um I have to go to the restroom so I'll just walk you out. So you met my parents I like them. Well that's because you don't know them. No... I like them and I love you. What is this? It's nothing. You were leaving? Yup, I'm leaving. Logan. Logan hey. Logan stop. I'm sorry. You're always sorry Amber. Hey look, I didn't expect you to waltz into the cafe and just announce your love for me. But when are you gonna be able to stand tall next to me? I told you I just need time. How much time Amber? I have never leapt like this before in my life and I keep leaping into you and I keep falling on my fucking face. I never asked you to do that. You just did it on your own. You jumped before I was ready I don't know how this is my fault Fault? Are you even listening? Is everything alright? Oh god. Mom everything is fine. Yeah everything's fine. Fuck. Amber. Shut up mom. What just happened? Please don't let me fuck this up. What'd you say? I said I love you. I love you too. Hey. Hi. Only got a couple of minutes so what'd you want to talk about? Hi sweetie. Hi. What are you guys doing here? Well Ethan called and uh... thought it was best that we sit down and try to figure this thing out. What's going on? Well we thought it best to convene. Convene? Yeah. Why? So... ...you and Logan. Are you kidding me? Okay, honey that's that's not why we're here. Wow. They... they didn't say anything You did right now. Really Amber? What? Just explains a lot. Okay I am not having this conversation. Okay, hold on. Woah woah woah hey. C'mon, c'mon. Ethan... Can we try to focus please? Yes, yeah okay. I'll... cut to the chase. Sit down. Great. Don't sit down. I got a job offer out of state. I'm leaving in three weeks. What? You're leaving? Yup. It's a two year comittment minimum. What about Emily? I took the job Amber. I'm not asking for your fucking permission. Ethan relax. Don't talk to her like that. What? Can you stay focused on Emily here? Hey, you have no idea Enough! Enough! Stop it! Enough. Mom, dad, I... Can we just... Alright c'mon. You're right. We'll be in the car honey. I don't know what to say. I think that went well. You know I really did love you Ethan. Part of that never goes away. I know that you think that I pushed you away a long time ago I - I - pushed you away but You didn't push me away Amber you burned my life to the ground. I know. Mine too. And I'm sorry about that. I'm... It's just that I still love you. And I don't know how to do this. I'm sorry that you're hurting. Look, I - I know I was an asshole to you a lot. I regret that. No - look at me. Amber. Tell me what to do. You tell me what to do and I'll do it. I was a kid Ethan. We were just kids. I - I - I - I... You need to be able to see that- I mean - Can you see that? Yeah. I didn't like the person I was becoming around you. I hated her and I don't want to be her anymore. I think that we both failed us and Emily. But Emily can't live without you You're an amazing mother. Yeah but you're her father. And she's gonna miss you so much. Why do you have to... I have to. He's leaving in three weeks. Wow. Just like that. Yup. It's just a lot of changes coming my way. I can help with Emily. I can help you. But I gotta figure out everything with work and - just everything is going to be really different. Amber... Amber... I don't think that you're listening to me. Hey I'm saying that I want to be a part of your life and Emily's life in a bigger way. I know and that's very sweet but... you're leaving for tour and Not forever. I'm here we can figure it... I know but it doesn't matter because it's not the right time. You're awfully quiet tonight. Yeah I guess. Anything you wanna talk about? There's just a lot going on right now. You know? With you taking Emily on and a lot of a lot of things. Yeah. I know it's gonna be a lot with work but I'm actually really excited. I miss her so much. Hey. What's going on? I think we need to talk. Okay. The owners of the apartment I'm taking care of are coming back early. And uh... You know I'm going on tour for a few months And I'm not sure where my home base is gonna be when I come back to New York. Okay. Is... that's all? I ju... What? I think we need to break up. What? I'm sorry. I just don't think this is working. What? We just can' keep doing this. What? I... I don't understand. Look okay I know that I said that this isn't the right time but I think maybe once Emily settles in a little, you know you can, you can move in with us. With me. Move in? Yes, I think that I'm ready for that. I'm... I mean it Logan I am ready for that. That's what I... You know if this is about my parents, you know I don't- I don't care what they think. Emily loves you. She loves you. I love you. I love you. I know that I keep letting you down but I never loved anybody like I love you. So why are you doing this? Because Amber I can't love you from such a vulnerable place. You say yes to me and my life is amazing you say no and I'm crushed and I can't love you from this place. I... I really... I really... I need you okay? I need you. I don't, I don't want to do this alone. I don't. You have all these things that you wanna do you know? And there's so much you have to focus on and it's not me. You gotta figure out what you want. I know what I want. I know what I want. I want you. I want you. Please don't do this. Don't do this okay? Come here. Please don't do this. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. So this is it then? That's all? I need you to go. Can I walk you home... at least? No. You should just go. Can... I can still walk you home... Please go. ♪ Summer in the green ♪ I love you.

I'm not sure what you want me to do with this information Amber. I don't think that lifestyle suits you or Emily. It's for the best. You don't think it suits me mom? It's not a dress that we're talking about. You asked my opinion. No, I didn't mom. You asked me how I was doing and I can't hide this I'm sorry, I'm a mess. Exactly why you need to turn the page. Nothing good can ever come of this darling. Why not. Because it's not who we are Amber. I'm your daughter mom, I'm not you. Of course not but you're... But what? I love her. Emily loves her. And she left you. It's for the best. Yeah maybe it is for you mom but it's not for me. She made me happy. She made me feel alive for the first time. And she loves me I know she still loves me. It's not love. It'll pass. It'll pass. It'll pass? Mom this is heartache. Okay? This is good old fashioned heartache. And if you can't see that if you can't see past your shame then I'm sorry but you don't get to be a part of this. You don't get to be a part of my life. You're gonna lose me. You're gonna lose her. You will lose us. C'mon We're going. C'mon. Grace. You just need to let her be. Okay? She'll ruin her reputation. This isn't easy for me either. Not in the same way as you but - Mostly because it's not easy for Amber. I mean, I can see that. She could just wait to meet the right man. She was happy. I mean, had you stopped to notice that? Happy? Put yourself in her shoes for a second. I would never be in her shoes Michael. Maybe being with Logan surprised her maybe it was there all along. In any case she's 30 years old going throug a divorce and coming out to the world As gay. I - I - just look -maybe maybe she is there's nothing we can do to change that. And I'm not sure I'd want to.

Aren't they all? Okay... Umm... Well when I first wrote the song it was kind of like I wrote it for someone I hadn't even met yet. But umm... when I played it for an audience for the first time a friend of mine was in the room and all of the sudden it was really clear... that somehow I had written it for her.
