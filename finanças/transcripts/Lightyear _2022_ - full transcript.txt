In 1995, a boy named Andy received a Buzz Lightyear toy for his birthday. The toy was from his favorite movie. This is the same movie. UNKNOWN SPACE 4.2 million light-years from Earth STAR COMMAND CRUISER SC-01 CREW: 1200 people. UNKNOWN PLANET THE WAKEUP IS INITIATED. CHANGE COURSE? NEW DEAL *CONFIRMED* Buzz Lightyear's Logbook From 3901 Sensors detect potential life on an uncharted planet. So we decided to change course. Space Ranger - begins assessing the planet to determine... whether to awaken the team of scientists from their long sleep. During core sampling, I will venture further exploration of this strange planet. The surface seems a little... ...unstable. So far, there are no signs that the air is harmless. Also, no sign of intelligent life. - Who are you talking to? - With no one. - You described what happened again - Not true. Just taking notes about the mission. - You know I'll never listen to them, right? - I know it. Description of what is happening - makes you focus on the mission. Sharpens the mind. Yes. If that bothers you, Commander Hawthorne. I will gladly return to turnips. Please don't call him "turnip" - But this airplane looks like a root crop. - Yes. This is obvious from the design. How long have you known that I love to describe things? Not enough. Ever since we were cadets. By the way, you forgot to bring a new one with you. Commander Hawthorne, you know how I feel about new kids. I feel like an autopilot. "How can I help you?" "Is there anything I can do, sir?" They don't help. They only make it harder. I would rather work alone. That's why I brought a new one with me. Hello. - Not. - Buzz, protocol requires us to take it with us. - He has sad eyes. - Buzz. You know I can't hold on seeing those pleading eyes. - Look at this new guy, Buzz. Look at him - No. - Look at him. Look at him - No. - I do not see him. Not! - Look. - Look. Look at the new one. - Not. Good! Good! You won. Listen, Fero... Fero... Feather... - Featheringhamstan, sir. - Listen, newbie. - First of all, you don't talk unless you're asked. You are still talking. - Yes, sir. Second, check out this suit. This suit means something. It protects not only the body, but also the Universe. This suit is the promise you made to the world. What you... You will do your best to complete the mission, no matter what the cost. You don't regret anything. Although the galaxy seems cruel, you... Can you please turn this off? - It is so simple. - You're laughing at me, right? -Yes. But in an innocent way. Look, what I'm saying is that the two of us have jobs. - Sir... - You're still talking. Every time, I understand what you are thinking and what you are doing. But this guy? I dont know. Where is he? See? That's exactly what I meant. They don't help. They are what they want to be. Watch out! Insects! - The ship is going down! - Back to turnips! Now you call him "turnip" Initiate stealth mode. I hope we have enough time. - We can't do it. - Nearly. Good. Plan b? Ready? Let's! I can change the route. Buy some time. - And where... - Help! -... brand new. - Help me! Buzz Lightyear's logbook. The planet is completely uninhabitable. Instead, I'm going to leave her immediately. Named cadet, Fero... Fero... the new one was caught, by some creature. So I strongly advise against joining... - Buzz! - Now! Hurry Ranger! We return back to the plane. Faster, Buzz! Hurry! - I'm in the engine room. - I will help. Do not do anything! I can handle. How can I help you? - Autopilot... - Is there anything I can do, sir? No and no again. This is not a simulation. - Commander, status? - Fuel is ready. You can go Carefully! The flight path is unsafe. Let's! Let's! A collision is inevitable. Cancel. Cancel. Captain Lighter, do you need my help? - Not. - Are you sure? I am Buzz Lightyear. I'm always sure. EVACUATION SLIDE It's bad, Buzz. Hyperspeed Crystal - Destroyed. Simply put, we are stuck here. I dont know. - What are you doing? - I'm resigning. - Not at all - Commander Hawthorne. I release myself from all responsibilities. It's my fault. These people deserve better. You can laugh at me. Finish the mission, Buzz. Here's what we do. We're not done until no one has gone home. - But we don't have fuel crystals. - We will extract minerals from this planet. - Let's create new crystals Crystal fusion is very unstable. - We'll try. - Not. It's too dangerous. Creating crystals for hyperspeed is like... throwing a lasso at the sun. Then you need someone to tie the sun to the plane. Then, you need someone who can fly a plane without fear of exploding. Who in their right mind wants... O... Buzz Lightyear's logbook. Start date: 3902. After a whole year on this planet... ...our team of specialists has gathered the planet's resources to establish a colony. Finally, the first test of hyperspeed crystals is ready. Are you ready, Captain Lighter? Always ready, Commander Hawthorne. To infinity and beyond. - Buzz! - We've breached the perimeter. - Come on... - Captain Lighter! Pilot Diaz. Today is a little ferocious, isn't it? - Are we ready for takeoff? - We'll be ready when you're ready, sir. A year of work, for a flight - 4 minutes. Amazing, right? - So it is - Let's find out if hypervelocity fuel is ready So that I can get us off this planet. I almost forgot. This is your IVAN, sir. - Fully charged. - Autopilot... And this is the XL-01 aircraft. Adorable, right? - Now let's move on to crystal fuel - Good morning, Captain Lighter This is a specially designed fuel mixture with a special composition. So, this is the fuel for hyperspeed. He has an 87.6% chance of success. I'll take this chance. Good luck captain. - We're all counting on you! - Readiness. - XL-01 - flight controller, how do you hear? - Excellent, XL-01. I will let you leave the planet for 4 minutes and you will immediately return home. - That's an order. - Received. Hyperspeed, I'm coming. Start in: ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one. LAUNCH. IVAN, show me the flight plan, please. Hello, I... Autopilot... Hello, I am your voice assistant. - Call me - IVAN. - Prepare a flight plan, IVAN. Of course. Your mission is to quickly navigate deep space around Alpha T'Kani, and then pass through the slow rings to return to T'Kani Prime. Estimated flight time: 4 minutes 28 seconds. XL-01, you're good to go. Received. Initiate the launch of hyperspeed Approaching 15% hyper speed. Fuel is ok Increase the speed to 0.6 C. 16% hyperspeed. Increase the speed to 0.7 C. 17% hyper speed. Fuel is ok. Approaching 0.8 C. We accelerate to hyperspeed. Malfunction in the first engine. Fuel is unstable. - IVAN, status! - Trajectory shift by 4 degrees. Failure to correct course, resulting in the inability to hit the deceleration rings. Soaring in space will lead to certain death. - Yes thank you. - Self-ejection is the only option. No no no. I can do it. Attention, you have 26 seconds to correct course. You now have 45 seconds to correct course. - Time for... - Please stop this. I'm sorry, my security protocol requires a backtrack. - Autopilot... - Mission failure is inevitable. Please write down your last words. - Not today, IVAN. - Not today, IVAN. If you are satisfied with this entry, click one. IVAN, stabilize engine power. Maximum power! Bad action. Not recommended. - You'll blow yourself up. - That's what I'm hoping for. Critical situation. Lack of fuel. Open fuel valve, IVAN. I'm sorry, I didn't hear. Please repeat. Open the fuel valve! Explosion in: five, four, three, two, one. Now! The course has been corrected. You failed to achieve hyperspeed. - I don't need to listen to this, IVAN. - Didn't you hear? Sorry, I'll repeat myself. - You failed to achieve hyperspeed. - I heard, but it's not necessary. Thanks IVAN. Commander, are you okay? Diaz. You are growing a beard. - Where did you get your beard from? - Umm... okay. First, welcome back. - Secondly... - Wait. What's this? How long have I been gone? 4 years, 2 months and 3 days. What? - We thought we lost you, Buzz. - Alisha. What happened? - Time slowdown. - What? Slowing down time is pretty simple. As you approach hyperspeed, your time slows down relative to Earth. So during your mission, you've grown a minute older, but we've grown a year older. Simply put, the faster you fly... The faster I fly, the further I move into the future. I understand. So what to do now? I dont know. But I think we need to postpone test flights until we find something else. Commander, we are determined to complete the mission. - That's what the Space Rangers do. - What will have to sacrifice, Buzz? Are you ready to lose another 4 years? So everyone is just stuck here? Because of me. Hey, are you okay? Yes, I'm fine. Wait, what is this? I'm engaged. Wow, that's great. - What is her name? - Kiko. - She is one of the team of scientists. It's funny. I wouldn't have met her if we hadn't been broke. Are you engaged to someone you just met? - Buzz. I met her three years ago. Exactly. Well, congratulations. I want to see her. There is enough time for this. Have a rest. That's an order. Welcome! -Alisha Hello Buzz. I am Sox, your personal robot companion. - My what? “I was created by Star Command. So that you can overcome the emotional transition after the trip. You're very conservative, robot cat. - But no, thanks. - I'm afraid it's protocol. The gauge shows you missed four birthdays. Do you want to celebrate a holiday? No. I don't want to ruin my food system. We can talk about your feelings. - I'm a good listener. - Not. Listen. I had a very long... day? - Which didn't go according to plan. - Mission failed? I confirm. Oh no. I'm sorry to hear this. Thanks, Sox. - Not at all, Buzz. - Can we play a game? You are sure? - No thanks. I can make a game especially for you. Based on your profile. Listen, Sox. I am very tired. So I'll go and sleep. Of course. I can provide sleep music if you like. I have a few options. Summer night? Ocean paradise? - Singing whales? - Not. - White noise is enough. - Good. - Good night, Sox. - Good night, Buzz. Raise up! Raise up! "Captain Lightyear, do you need my help?" - No, I can handle it. - Buzz, are you sure? - I'm afraid it's protocol. I can handle! - I'll manage... - The sensor shows that you had a nightmare. Do you want to talk about it? No. Good. But remember, my mission is to help you. And I will not give up on my mission. - Yes? Yes. You know what, Sox. I'm not going to abandon the mission either. Good. How can I be of service to you? Why don't you play with your mouse buddy? Anything more complex? Do you want something more difficult? Good. You can work on fuel stability. Fusion of crystals. Of course. When do you think you'll be back? In 4 years. Wait, you don't have to do this. Commander, it's my fault. I have to fix everything. Good. But perhaps we should think about it. Think about what? Come on, we're Space Rangers. We will complete the mission. Definitely fun to wear that costume again. People have begun to forget how important the Space Rangers are. Well, I'll fix it. Infinity... ...not the limit. UNSTABLE FAILURE UNSTABLE FAILURE UNSTABLE HAPPY FORTY YEARS. UNSTABLE UNSTABLE Hello Buzz. You'll be back in a year or two. But... ...I won't be here anymore. I don't know what happened, but... ... I seem to be very old. I always thought we'd be Space Rangers again. I miss flying among the stars. All these adventures. But that's not all, more than anything. I miss you. Hi grandma. Hello, honey. I'm leaving a message for my friend Buzz. - Space Ranger? - Yes exactly. Now he is in space. This is my granddaughter, Izzy. I'll be a Space Ranger too. Just like him? Just like you. Farewell, Buzz. I'm sorry I won't be able to see you complete this mission. infinity- Not the limit. Sorry to interrupt. I just moved to... Just look. THE REAL Buzz Lightyear. - Yes sir. - Commander Cal Burnside. I was your big fan when I was a kid. Well, then I'm looking forward to working with you to get everyone out of here. What? - Nobody told you? - Told me what? Yes. Hmm... - That was the last mission, Buzz. - What? - We decided to stay here. - Wait. Here? - No, this option is unacceptable. - Now it is. We are building it. Laser Shield. Capable of resisting all those beings. We will stay here and take what we have. Accept? Wait. You don't understand, Commander. I can still go on. I can get us out of here. Oh my god you still believe it. We'll be fine, Buzz. Thanks to the Laser Shield. Hello Buzz. Buzz? I have good news, Buzz. I solved the fuel problem. What? An interesting combination. With a small difference, a huge change is taking place. Sox, how could you do that? It took 62 years, 7 months and 5 days. - Is it stable? - In theory. I'm so interested to check. On your next mission. Yes. What? Good evening, captain. We'll confiscate your robot companion. - What are you speaking about? - For security. You must understand that. No. I do not understand. In order to complete the program. We'll have to deactivate your cat. This will take a second. Wait a minute. Let me do it. What? - Buzz, where are we going? What? - We're going into space. Buzz Lightyear's logbook. The date of the beginning... I dont know. Stable fuel formula test. I plan to achieve hyperspeed and finally complete this mission. - Who are you talking to? - Irrelevant. Buzz, I'm programmed to obey orders from Star Command. Star Command is going to incapacitate you. - What? - Erase you. No more Sox. Hey, you can't come here... I didn't know you could do that. Wait. Was it an ambush for me? - What if I have to fight? - I gave you 5 minutes. - All right, Sox. Enter your password. - Received Good. Let's try. - Just not the formula! - Shhh... Center, there's a security breach on the starting gate. Well. Hello, I am a navigator with internal voice activation. Did you hear it? Control Center, activity detected on XL-15. Check. Good. XL-15, that's control. - Is there anyone there? - Say something! XL-15 please reply. Understood you, Control. It's simple... ...the cleaning team. We are cleaning the cockpit. Shall we put things in order here? Commander, do you have permission to clear the cockpit of the XL-15? What? No. - Stop! Come back! - Wait! XL-15, you're violating Star Command protocol. Stop your activity immediately! Open it! Commander, this is Captain Lightyear! What? Lightyear? Get him out of there! Stop it now and put your hands up! - Support! We need support! - Send a ZAP patrol there! Okay, Tim, let's go! Block access to the hangar! He's not going anywhere. ACCESS DENIED. - We're an easy target here. - Let me. Wait. What happened? - He took control of me. - How? Lightyear! Lightyear! I know you can hear me. Get the plane back to base now, or... Sox, let's get over the hyperspeed line. And bring everyone home. Hyperspeed is close to 70%. Hyperspeed is close to 80%. Fuel-stabilized. 90% hyperspeed. 100% hyperspeed... Congratulations, Captain Lighter. You have reached hyperspeed. We did it. Sox, we did it! Congratulations Buzz. I was so scared I already regret that I went with you. Not... - What is it, Buzz? - Our speed is still very high. - What? Oh no! - Are we going to the bottom? No. Technically, yes. Just hold on! Finally, after so many years. Thanks Sox. Logbook. Additionally. After I borrowed a ship from Star Command. I've reached hyperspeed. And I can finally leave this planet forever. Buzz Lightyear calls Star Command. Answer me. Star Command, answer. Why don't they answer? Hey! Robot. - What? - Robot. What is he doing with the ship? - My ship! Where did he go? - Shut up! Up there. Where is the pilot? - What is it? What's happening? - Lie down! Behind me! They are also sure that they saw the plane land. - Who? - Robots. Why do robots exist? Where did they come from? - Where did you come from? From here? - I'm from here. Wait. Buzz? Alisha? No, this is my grandmother. - I-Izzy - Izzy? But you were so... Sox, how long did we fly? 22 years, 19 weeks and 4 days. Wait. Come on! Here. - I heard one. Yes. - A robot? - Impressive - I'm Hawthorne. Of course. Your grandmother and I could complete each other's sentences. If you can do it like she can, we'll be... ... great team. ...robots are crying. Good. Hmm... So... - Tell me about the ship. - Exactly. - The ship Zurg appeared about a week ago. - What does "Zurg" mean? This is the only thing the robot said. So let's call it a big ship. Zurg spaceship has arrived The robots found our base... T'kani Prime has been attacked. The robots are attacking. - Everyone inside, go to the fence! - Watch out! Activate the laser shield. Right now! This is the last we heard. All these people... They are counting on me. Now they are trapped. We tried to contact them, but there is no connection. Not outside, not inside. Sox? She is right. Have you verified the information through the cat? He's not just a cat. The truth is, Sox was a gift from your grandmother. - Hey, Izzy. - Hello, Sox. What is this noise? Don't break my cat. He snores. He likes it. Sox, do you like it? - Yes. I hope you are ready to take action. Because we need a pilot. - Why? I have a plan and I have a team. Faster! My team, get ready! I found the pilot. You can start Operation Surprise Party. I like it. We had an elite army. The best of the best. Your grandmother was one of the greatest Space Rangers. It will be my honor to work with you. Come on. Let's go team. Let's review the plan. - Kill robots - And try not to die. "Try not to die" sounds like you crave it every day. We have one goal. We have to put this crystal in the turnip and get out of here. To do this, we need to get to the base. To do this, we must destroy all the robots. To do this, we must destroy the Zurg ship. And to do all this, we must not die. Derik? Let me explain the plan for Operation Surprise Party. It was a variation on the name, reminiscent of Operation Lightning Spear. - You got a medal for that operation, right? - Actually two. But... - How did you know Operation Lightning Spear? I completely read my grandmother's book about space rangers. Twice. - Excuse me, robot cat. - Oh, I'm sorry. Sensors show that the Zurg- spacecraft is powering the robots on Earth. So we take off. Let's destroy the ship. And surprise the robots. They are ready. Then, we'll insert your crystal into the turnip. And we'll complete the mission. Good plan. Infinity- - Do you want me to pull your finger? - Do not do that. I didn't mean it. It's simple... - I'm sorry, this is a common thing for me and your grandmother. I didn't mean to do it... In any case, forget it. Let's move all this ammunition to the Battleship and prepare for battle. Operation Surprise Party begins. Buzz, can you hear that? I heard something... Do you think it's a robot? I've never seen a robot this far from the base. I didn't hear anything. Do not worry. We'll cover you! TRAINING AMMUNITION Children's patrol - ready for action! Children's what? Not! Airplane! - They got me? - Close enough. "Sorry, I'm unprepared for this weapon." I will recharge it. Unprepared? What does "you're not prepared" mean? - Give me the gun. Take him! - Take what? I'm not allowed to carry weapons. Violation of my conditional warranty! - A conditional guarantee? - Buzz! Izzy, come on! - Not. - Good. New plan. New plan? What was the old plan? I need... Has anyone seen the arrows? I can't reload without arrows. I found her! I found an arrow. Take a look at this. - They got me? - A little to the left! What? They got me? - You did it! - Yes! Boom. How exactly... Where does it come from... Who you are? We are "Children's Patrol" Ready for service. Good. I need more information. We are a team of volunteers and purposeful cadets. We train here a week a month. Moe, Darby and I were the first. Here's how we prepare for Operation Surprise Party. So you are new recruits? We love being new recruits. I still remember that day. Good. Have you received ammunition training? - Part of her. Tactical thinking? Combat experience? - Delayed. Yes! If that counts for that robot situation. - Good. Come on Sox. - What are you doing? You guys look like good people. I am very supportive of your educational initiative. But then I'll figure it out myself. We just saved you from a robot. - Sorry, what? - Mo managed to shoot him. - Mo was just lucky. - Highly. If you can show directions to other spacecraft... There are working spaceships in an abandoned warehouse. Good. Where is it? Adjacent storage warehouse with raw materials processing center... ... which is 4.2 km from your current location. Excellent. Where is it? In fact, everything is quite simple. Good. You are heading south towards the base. After passing 2 red lights... Wait a minute. This is a dead end. I saw. I'm in the wrong place. Sorry. I'll start over. You are heading south towards the base. After passing 2 traffic lights, you turn a little to the left from... Oops. I made a mistake again. We'll just show you. - Let me repeat. You're heading south towards the base. After passing 2 red traffic lights, you must turn sharply to the right... Buzz Lightyear's logbook. After reaching hyperspeed, I got a little problem. To escape this planet I have to destroy the giant alien ship. By oneself. Without any help. You know we can help you. - This is our plan. - I can't let that happen. Star Command Protocol Code 2709 Section 3... ...forbids me to attract unprepared people to especially dangerous places. Good. But I'm Hawthorne. It's more than just a name, Izzy. - You should know... - I know what you're going to say! -...how to deal with the situation. Good. - Confused. And you? Are you participating in a temporary experiment or something? Parole Program. I did this to shorten my term. But I learned a lot while I was there. Darby can make explosives from any 3 items. - Excellent. Well, what about you? - Me? I thought it was just a training camp, but apparently not. That's why I came here to collect my things and..... - He's lazy. - I just don't give up. - You gave up. - What are you talking about? - I'm just going in the other direction. - Yes. Direction towards surrender. - You know? I give up. - See? - To your right. Where did I stop? Here it is. Let me repeat. Keep improving your skills. - It's the only way to get back. - We can help you. And I appreciate it. Just go back to your training center. Be alert and be careful. I'll go on the battleship P-32 to blow up the Zurg spaceship. So this is just goodbye? Right. Bye. Sorry. I forgot my cat. - Discovered a life form. - Who are they? Sectoid organism. It could be some kind of "Nest". - Do they pose a threat? - Sensors show that they are in a sleeping state. Very well. Look. It's the XL-01. So much time has passed since then... What happened? Come on, I'll show you something. Finally. Sorry to interrupt. You look very cheerful. What are you guys doing here? It's not safe here. - You took the keys to our truck. - Here they are Turn it off! - Come on, come on. I'm trying! - Quiet! Made. - Someone... - Close the door! You were going to say "close the door" and I closed it. I will be frank. I didn't want this. As we are! Everyone take your weapons. - I wouldn't mind. But I'm a parole officer... Like Star Commander. I give you Extraordinary Powers. We have to get out of here. - Another thing. - Buzz, the survival rate is 13.2%. A little low. - What about stealth mode? - How do you know about stealth mode? My grandmother often told me about him. It's like playing hide and seek. - Actually, it's a good idea. I'll go there in stealth mode to outsmart them. Or, if I may say so.... We can all use stealth mode and get out of here. You mean you're going to put on the Space Ranger suit? This suit has my name on it. Good... Let's repeat. - I'm going... - This way - Are you going... - In this direction. Excellent. Very well. Just look at this. I am Fero... Fero.. F... Here is a pen. Cool. - Do you have a pen in your suit? - Attention! Stealth mode is very simple. Only 2 stages. You press a button. I'll tell you which button... - This one? - What about this button? - Sorry, but we don't have time to talk about every button. Good. But what about this one? No need! This is an escape pod. - Never pull on her. - There are no extra buttons for the Space Ranger. Excuse me, I didn’t hear which button is responsible for the hidden mode? - This button. - I understand! You press that button, then you leave through the front door. And I'll go to the Zurg spaceship. - Ready? - Ready! Wait! Now ready. I almost forgot. Good. Farewell again. Sox, you're blocking my view. Sorry. And so? - Not. - Good. What about this? How about this? Good. Here we are. Very well. Stealth mode works as intended. It's pretty cool. These stupid insects can't see us. Hello insect. I'm here, insect. You see? I cant. They don't see me. Time is over. Wait a minute. Timer. They don't know about the timer. You don't see me. I see you. I see you too. The bugs can see us! No, I give up! Insects! No. It won't work. You must keep walking! We must turn around! They are coming to us! No need! Don't get close to the plane! Well done! We are a great team! Why praise yourself? Because I'm just like Hawthorne at the moment. But you could succeed if... - If you would say about the timer in the hidden mode? - Yes... Okay, everyone follow me! Hello, I... Hold on! - Are we going to go into space? - Not. I want to shake them off. I'm so dizzy. I think I need a package. - Don't throw up on the plane. - I see the stars. This is space. - What's wrong with her? What? - She's afraid of space. - This is terrible. - Izzy, remember your workout. - I'm about to throw up. - No need! Now we will help you. - Buzz! There's a spaceship! - Izzy, I'm trying... - I do not see anything! - No, the dark side of the spaceship. There! At 10 o'clock! Hold on! It won't be easy! - Everything is fine? - I think yes. - Sox, report damage. - One second please. Phew. That's better. - That's better? - No, it's definitely worse. You know what I meant. - How can you be afraid of space? - It's simple. Imagine that you are lost in space, flying in the same direction... ...forever. Then how were you going to blow up the Zurg spaceship? I was ground support. I know. Grandma was not afraid of space. Yes, because she was a Space Ranger. Fear of space was automotically impossible. - What was that thing? - I dont know - He will return? - I dont know. But how is it? .. Good. You do not know. I finally got the Crystal. Everything had to end. Who am I kidding. I don't need a crystal. I need a time machine to get rid of this. Inspection completed. How bad is it? The explosion was absorbed by the heat-shielding fiber. Just because the lightning was small. Good. To be able to take off, you need to repair special capacitors. Electricity problems. - How do you know? - We studied it. Special capacitors? Do you remember? Did we put together a field radio station last month? - Yes, it was fun. - Yes. - But Darby screwed up. - I'm going to kick your ass. Please, I'm trying to think. I screwed up, but then I fixed it. Yes, but you messed up the computer console. I need small coils for... - What was it? - Special capacitors. There's a lot of space around here. If you want to make some noise, you can go there. Look! Nobody is trying to think. - We can go there. - Excellent. Just perfect. Yes. Good. New plan! - What? The mining object must have a console, right? This console should have a coil, right? - The coil must have... - Special capacitors. Exactly what we need to fix the starship. Right? She is right. Good job. Way of thinking, like Hawthorne. Let's grab the components and get out of here. Before the spaceship found us again. TERILLIUM MINE Altitude 1200 Over there! Good. Went. Buzz Lightyear's logbook. In order to fix our starship, we must find a way to infiltrate the command center and... Good job, ex-con. So. The coil should be here. Sox? Need a pen? Ready. Good. Maybe another time. Oh no. Security measures activated. Just not again. Not what? What's this? Cone trap. She will hold us until no one comes. Nobody heard us. - We can just leave, right? - We can't just leave. Of course we can. We can walk. See? Come on. I told you, didn't I? Be careful this thing... - Can melt with one touch! - Sorry... - But maybe we can disconnect back? - It won't work. We didn't even try. - It didn't work. - Buzz. - Wait. I can't help it if I get stuck too. Sox, can you run? I can't take control. Wait. There must be a weak point here This means we can... - To the side. - Wait! Here it is. This thing powers this thing. - Then let's hit again. - Wait a minute. You need to open the door first. When I open the door, you must hit the power source. - This thing will disappear, and we can get out. - Yes, sir. Ready? Keep trying. We are underweight. Buzz, we need you. Wait. There? What if it doesn't work? - I can't save you. - You don't have to save us. You must join us. Again! Again! Again! Not! Get up! Watch out! Catch! - Buzz, no! - We need this reel! We are holding you. Look, snack. Someone will something? MEAT SANDWICHES This will give you some strength. This is for you. What's this... What about him? Plain Sandwich. Why is the meat on the outside? Isn't that a sandwich? No. Bread must be outside. Do you like bread-meat-bread? Too much bread. But he's all... ..wet. Yes. The juiciest part is outside. When was the last time you ate a sandwich? I dont know. A hundred years ago? - More or less. - Just look at this guy. - Bread-meat-bread. - Too much bread. It absorbs all the moisture in the mouth. Oh no! Sox! Wake up Sox. Come on buddy. Come back to me. Sox, I'm so sorry. Sox. Hello. I need a reboot. Sorry guys. I almost killed Sox. I almost killed us all. Hey listen. It was a mistake. Really, Buzz? You know. Try to be a little better. Listen... I just... When I first entered the academy... You know. Great. I created problems. Every day. I am entangled in a field of obstacles. My hands were shaking so I missed the target. Not the main target. For all purposes. I gave up the first Sunday. Because obviously I don't deserve to be a Space Ranger. - Truth? - Yes. But her grandmother saw something in me. And I started all over again because of her. Recalibration. One corrupted file has been repaired. Hey, he's awake. Granny. Hey Sox. I need your help. I want you to take care of my best friend. His name is Buzz. Now he's gone. But he will be back soon. He is a Space Ranger. He will take us home. What happened? Didn't you hear it? She believed that I could correct my own mistake. And because of that belief, she lost everything. Everything? No. She has a grandmother, Kiko. My father and me. All her friends. She didn't want to live here. But she's had her whole life on this planet, Buzz. All of us. Except you. We wanted to be Space Rangers again. We wanted our lives to have meaning. Believe me. They mean a lot. It turns out pretty tasty. Yes. Bread-meat-bread. How long have you been eating like this? Is always. The battery is fully charged. Come on. Let's put this coil in our ship and get out of here. - Sox, can you guide us? - Of course. I see that you want to play catch up. I will get to you. - Sox? - Where are you going? Gotcha! - Sox? - Yes. Sorry. Operation Surprise Party. We are walking! What? No. I can't put you in danger. Are you going on a mission alone? - I can do it. Because you have Hawthorne. And I appreciate it. Here's what I'll tell you. I would say if I needed you. But for a while, return to the Armadillo without any problems. Buzz! Not! What? He's following me! Return to the starship! But Buzz! Buzz Lightyear's logbook. Chasing after us... ...just a huge robot. I escaped, and the others returned to the starship. Buzz? What? How do you know my name? - Come with me. - What? This is clearly a violation of my parole. Let's. Let's just get out of here. Get ready to fly. Operation Surprise Party is back. But Buzz? What? Should I go on a mission alone? We can't fly yet. It will take 5 minutes to prepare all the capacitors. We can't stay here for 5 minutes. - The ship is equipped with the ability to hover. - Let's use this. - We can outsmart them in a fiery geyser. - Show me the way. You guys destroy these robots! But we never had that kind of training. It's difficult? We have spikes. And it's likely to explode. - Just do what you think is right. - What? - What are you going to do? - I'm going to dance with Mr. Boom. It just gives pleasure. - 24% completed. - Out of 100%? They are after us. - Where is the fire geyser? - Straight ahead. Do not worry. I memorized every corner... Watch out! Hold on. Drop it. - Wait a minute. - Just drop it! Fire geysers ahead! 50% completed. Hey, there's a lot of explosives in here! Faster! Give me something! 90% completed! Izzy, do you know how to set up the power? I practiced with a simulator. It's time to try it out. - Do you need my help? - Absolutely not. 95% done! - Prepare engines. Middle button. - Ready! Remember workouts. Don't pull the trigger, but squeeze the trigger. I know. 99% completed. Made! 100% completed. Reboot. Good. - Get ready for launch, after refueling... No! - Press the button! - Oh no. - Buzz! Take the Crystal! I... Buzz... I am so sorry. Everything happened so fast and I... I just... I made a mistake. Yes. Good... But we haven't given up yet, have we? - We can still do something. - Izzy... Look around. Nothing canbe done. This mission... Its end. Buzz. Buzz! Where are you going? I just need... ... calm down. Not! Buzz! Buzz? What the... What's this? Where are we? Who are you? That's a good question. You look good, Buzz. Dad? Try again. Sox? Hello Buzz. I do not understand. I spoiled it all. Hey, it was just a mistake. Do you remember what you told me? - Now everything is different. - Why? Because it's my fault. I have to be as good as my grandmother. As expected by Hawthorne. But I am not. Buzz? Wait. You are not me. I am who you are now. But I am you, 50 years from now. There can't be two of me. But we are both here. Good. If you are me, then I thought about the numbers... - from 1 to 173. - Wow. Funny, right? The robots here don't say Buzz, for them I'm just "Zurg". How? I do not understand. Do not think about it. It does not matter. - Buzz! - Yes? - Yes? You must explain everything to him. You're right. I'm sorry. It's really unexpected. Finally you are here. You know, I also achieved hyper speed. How are you. But no one greeted me like a hero. The new commander arrests me for stealing an XL-15. I know how to send them home, but they didn't care. And I ran away. I went as far as I could. And as fast as he could. With such speed and range. I have flown for centuries. And I became you in the future. Feel the technology you never imagined. And it's all. If I used that crystal to travel to the future, why not use it just to turn back time? We cannot turn back time. - Now we can. Listen to me Buzz. - What? I managed to break time. What happened to you never happened to me. This is a new present that has never been lived. We can change everything, Buzz. If we could turn back time, we could prevent the landing on this planet. - Avoid collision with mountains. - Continue the mission upon returning home. And all this will never happen. - Good plan. - Good plan. And this crystal is the key to everything. - Wait, don't you already have it? - Like this. My crystal ended after checking the passage of time. Weakened by itself too. It took some time. Turns out it's not an exact science. It's time travel, all I could get. Let's tune this car. - You should know how. - Wait, it's like the one on the turnip? Pull up the lever. So we created all of this? No, everything just... appeared. I just manage everything. Alisha will be a Space Ranger again, Buzz. Yes. - Although... - What? Alisha will not have a family. - She won't have Izzy. - Who is Izzy? Look, she doesn't miss anyone... ...if you've never met her family to begin with. Right? The only thing people will know is that we are completing our mission. Here. Give me your crystal. Buzz? I do not know, maybe... “…maybe we should think again. - Think about what? Commander Hawthorne believes we can right the wrongs we've made. And because of that belief, she lost everything. No. Turns out we were wrong all along. She's had her whole life there. - What is this life? We should be Space Rangers. Our lives must have meaning. You don't want to live like this, Buzz. Wake up from the same nightmare. Because of your own mistakes. And you will finally be able to come to terms with them. Starting right now. You're right. I cant. Where are you going? You and me, we are different. I'm sorry. No Buzz. I'm sorry. Can you steer this ship? - But there's no fuel. - You see? - So don't act if you don't have the necessary skills. Then what do you want? Wait for the robots to find us? It's better than being stuck here where no one can find us. You are the last person I expected to see when I find myself in a situation where life and death are at stake. Lucky you. Because we are in a hopeless situation. We really miss Buzz. He's too far away to track. Go inside! What? Get on the ship! What is our plan now? We don't have any more weapons. - Good. We're getting out of here! - Where? We're going into space. Let me go! I don't understand what happened to you, Buzz. You have changed. And not for the better. Not! You can't do it. You will erase them all. Exactly. You're going to take it all from me. Someone's families. Their friends. My friends. I have friends on this planet. Everyone has them. Except us. I hardly know you, Buzz. All these new ideas. You know? We will erase it all. - I'll give you 5 minutes. - Why? I like the new you. We must destroy this ship. - Can you take me to the bridge? - Of course. Follow me. Zurg. Operation Surprise Party, here we go! We must protect our ship. Don't let any robot through this door. Do not worry. We will seal it. I'll make sure the chip on the token is with his name on it. - What? - I got 2 signals. I must have been wrong. I'm going to triangulate to close the distance with him. Behind me! Shortest way. - He teleports. Good. - We have to go! Excellent. I don't know all these settings. - Wait. IVAN? - Yes captain. I'm so glad to see you. Starting self-destruct sequence in 2 minutes. Good. The countdown to self-destruct begins. Buzz, you don't want to leave me here, do you? Just you, buddy. Come on. - Traitor! - Not! Just tell me where the crystal is! We must protect our ship. - How do we close this door? - I dont know. - You said don't worry. We'll seal it - Yes. Just turn off the power. And here we are. Just relax. You see? What? The signal gets stronger. He must be ahead. It's a huge space. Gather your spirit. Gather your spirit. No. I do not understand. The signal indicates that Buzz is 15 meters away from us. He is there. Do you think you're different, Buzz? You became me. You just didn't notice. - I'll never be you. If you are not me, you will not be anyone. Artificial gravity is disabled. No. - What are you doing? Cool. - Bomb. - Do you need a pen? - No, take this. Thank you. - Delicious - Give me the paper. This is amazing. Feeling a little weird when you suck on it. Give me the gum. Wait, I'm not done yet. The taste is still there. Faster! When they step on it, they will explode. What if they don't step on it? I don't want to step on her. And you? That's why we have to drop something heavier. Not! Buzz? Buzz! Alisha? Are you okay? No, I can't do this alone. - I need help. - Buzz. - I'm not my grandmother. - Izzy. I don't need your grandmother. I need you. Sox, how do we get there? Through the airlock. How? There's nothing there. Exactly. Nothing will stop you. Just stay straight ahead. Not! - Let me be clear. You made a bomb to make an explosion - Yes. - Which will seal the door. - Yes. - We must hurry. - I'm in hurry. Why don't you hurry up? Come on. You can. - Not. - Just don't look down. Or up. Space is everywhere here. Everywhere. Around you. I'm sorry, maybe I can't help. Just go ahead. As soon as you jump, this will become the direction in which you will move. What if I miss? Don't miss. No no! Sox! Sox! Not! Thanks, Izzy. There is no entrance here. Maybe I can help. You can't hide from me, Buzz. It's like you're running away from yourself. I can always find you. Manual scoring included. - Buzz! - Let's! - Hurry, let's get out of here! - We must destroy the ship. We have no time. Nothing will work. We'll manage. The self-destruct sequence will be completed in... Ten, nine, eight... - Darby, we have to give up. - Not! I will not Give Up. - Yes, me too. - Hold on! Five. Four. - Let's! - Everyone inside! Three. Two. One. Buzz Lightyear's logbook. We destroyed the Zurg spaceship, along with the Zurg. Now I have to fix my team's plane... Going somewhere? Warning. Engine failure. Buzz Lightyear's Logbook I have to take the Crystal. And finally, for the last time, complete the mission. I'll be back and be a Ranger again, Buzz. And you? You will feel like you have never been here. Prepare for death. Not today, Zurg. We are pulled by the gravitational pull of the planet. - Are we falling? - I'm afraid it is. Buzz! - I can not do it. - Buzz. Everything is fine. We can. Can you make sure the plane is stable? Yes, I think so. Good. Sox! Use emergency batteries to power your flight controls. Accepted. I need a second pilot. Good. But we never did it, only in the simulator. It's time to practice. Remember, pull the steering wheel towards you. When you're ready for... Sorry. From now on, it won't happen again. It didn't work. We're falling too fast. - IVAN! We're falling too fast! - Yes captain. Congratulations! We don't need confetti. We need a brake. - I know! On the floor! - Let's slow down! Darby! - He's stuck! - What? The lid is stuck. I need a screwdriver. To open the lid. Some small stick. I have a pen! - Buzz! - Everything is fine? - Yes. - I think yes. - Police! Everyone run! - Wait! It's just a rescue team. Right. Good. You look like a respectable citizen. - What brought you into custody? - I hijacked the plane. Who among us has never hijacked a plane during... ...relative despair? I am a resourceful person. My weapon. This is ingenuity. I can do anything! - Don't yell in my ear. - Yes. Sorry. Are you okay? I've been in space. Your grandmother would be proud of you. You should be too. She has always been proud of you. Wait, where's your crystal? Destroyed. But what is your mission? You really wanted to go home. You know, for the first time in so many years, I feel like I'm at home. - Zurg. - Watch out! What? Stop, now! Lightyear! Escape with Star Command property. The theft of an experimental spaceship. Ignoring direct orders from the commander. I should have thrown you in jail. But... I have other plans for you. We want you to form a new core team of Space Rangers. Department of Defense for the Protection of the Universe. You'll Become a Space Ranger Again, Buzz. You are free to choose a team from the Zap Patrol at its best... ... and train him as you wish. That's very kind of you, sir. But... Too bad I'll have to give it up. I already have my own team. This suit is armed, right? - Laser arm. Rocket Wings. - There should also be a pen. I can't believe he was allowed to add this. Too bad I don't have them. Your file has been cleared and you have been acquitted. Why are you still complaining? I'm free for good behavior, not for good attitude. I have never worn trousers. But suddenly it seemed strange to me to wear it otherwise. - Do I look weird without pants? - You look good. I wish I could. Grandmother. I am a Space Ranger. Just like you. Okay team. We're picking up a signal from the Gamma quadrant in sector 4. We don't know what it is. But I don't want them to invade our planet. Accepted, Commander, you can count on us. Buzz Lightyear's logbook. Start date 4071. As a member of the elite universe defense unit of the Space Rangers core team, we are in charge of protecting the galaxy from planetary invasion... ... from any sworn enemy of the Galactic Alliance. Everyone, make sure All is ready? - Ammunition? Supplies? -Ready - I brought sandwiches. - Will your stomach be all right? - Prepared. - Good. - Someone forgot something? - I think we're ready. Hello, I am your voice navigator. Glad you're back, IVAN. Ready to launch. Sox? IVAN, launch a hypervelocity launch. Of course. Okay, Space Rangers. Let's go. Infinity... ...not the limit. Laser Shield. If you prefer a different route, you head south past stunning views. That's what they told me. But if you hurry, this will be the fastest route. Have questions? Hi? Oh...
