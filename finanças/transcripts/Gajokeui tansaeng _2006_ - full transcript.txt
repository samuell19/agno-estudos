A Blue Storm production Lotte Entertainment presents additional production support by Korean Film Council (KOFIC) You're supposed to eat this on a train. - You're generous. - Yup. Some things go really well together. Boiled eggs and soda are a great combo. Boiled eggs without soda. Don't you get thirsty just imagining that? - Hold this for a second. - Yeah? Thanks. You must easily get friendly with guys you don't know. No, it's because you're nice. - Me? - Yes. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Hello! Sorry I'm late! - Who are you? - I'm Yoo Sun-kyung. We don't interview people who are late. Certainly, I know that. I don't like people who aren't punctual either. Please give me a minute. You must be the boss. Please help yourself with some drinks. My name is Yoo Sun-kyung. I believe a tour guide must be responsible with service, as well as have good judgment and carefulness. What? I've never had hair in my food. It's not the first time. We're regulars, you know. - Yeah! - This sucks! Look, my hair's straight. This hair is curly. Hyo-sun, it's your hair. Give us a new plate! - We're regulars! - Yeah! Okay, okay. I'll give you a new one. Great! - Why? Want another free dish? - Yes! - What? What? - Noodles! Noodles! Hey, that's too much. How about pickles? - Hey! - That's unfair!? Okay, you win. I'll give you noodles. Hello? Hello? Hyung-chul? FAMILY TIES It's me. I can't see you today. Yes? It's Hyung-chul. Didn't I tell you before? He's my little brother. He hasn't come home for five years. He said he's coming home today. Yes, I guess he's matured. No, please don't come. We need some time together. Yes. He's shy though he doesn't seem to be. Okay, then we could have dinner at your place some time. Cut neatly... In bite sizes... Sis, how've you been? The house is the same. But it needs a paint job. You! You rotten bastard! Mira! Flowers! What happened to you? I've been well. I'm here now so let's be happy. I'm starving. Cook anything good? You good-for-nothing. - Hurry and come in! - Hold on. Hurry and come in! What are you waiting for? You brought someone? I got married. Come in. Hello. Hurry and come in. What are you so shy for? Say hello. Mu-shin, this is my sister Mira. How do you do? You're married? You don't smoke? No. Oh, I'm sorry. I'll put it out. It's okay. You can smoke. - Isn't my sister nice? - Of course, she's your sister. She looks like a great person. So do you. Her name is Mu-shin? Yeah, Oh Mu-shin. I call her Mushy sometimes. Where did Hyung-chul go? Huh? Hyung-chul? He went to work. To make money. - Mrs. Mu-shin. - Yes? The ash is gonna fall. I didn't mean to put it out. I've had enough anyway. I bought the same bulbs, but... It doesn't work? I do this all the time. Do you mind if I try? Come down. I'll do it. Like this... Ah, it works. It fits well. Turn it on. Hey, it works. - It works! - Yeah You missed me, right? Well, I missed you. - I don't know. - Sure you do. Hey, I'm thinking about opening up a shop. I saw an empty spot nearby. Where? Going to Seoul is too crowded for me. And Mu-shin would fit in better here. But I don't have any money. Who said I need your money? You don't? But I really really don't have any. Hey, that hurts. I was gonna make money for your dowry. You'll really regret this later when you get married. I'd rather regret. You're so mean. I guess I'll regret it later. # Go and make a mung # bean-pancake and eat it. Just stuff your face. I'm gonna report to the cops you're selling rotten food to kids! How about we toast? Nice to meet you. So, Hyung-chul, will you live with Mira here? We should get our own place, of course. Okay. But he'll have to stay with me for a bit. He just got into town. Right? Hyung-chul, what kind of work do you do? Mu-shin makes Hanbok very well. - Traditional dresses. - Traditional dresses? Mu-shin has talented hands. That's why I thought of opening a small Hanbok shop. Is that so? - So she has a talent for making clothes. - I didn't know. Mira, when we get married, we could ask her to make one for us. But at night we should sell liquor at the shop. Right? What kind of dress shop sells liquor? Make clothes during the day, and sell drinks at night. You sometimes say things that make no sense. Hey, girls these days sell liquor dressed in Hanbok. You're just not up to the trend. No one serves in miniskirts anymore. - Right? - Sure. But we won't send girls out with clients. Oh, we were just joking. Would you like anything more? Help yourselves. How about Soju? Do you have Soju? Beer makes me full. I prefer Soju as well. But Mira doesn't. She prefers something more classy. Mu-shin, you're different, right? You seem to like Soju bars. You seem to like strong drinks. How much can you take? I can't drink much. I bet you'd drink five bottles easy. Let's get the party started. Mira doesn't drink so actually she's no fun. Mu-shin, did you bring your Hanbok? Let's have some fun tonight. What kind of fun? Well, I thought it'd be fun to drink with Mu-shin. What, you son of a bitch? Come outside, asshole. Your idea of fun is to mess with my wife? Come outside, you bastard. Hyung-chul! Mira... Am I supposed to follow him? What's wrong? He's not good enough for you. I couldn't stand watching that pig playing innocent. He's a bandit type, isn't he? He looks scary. Stop it. Have I ever talked bad about Mu-shin? What's that supposed to mean? Tell me. Whether you sell Hanbok or liquor, I don't care. Are you finished? Sell what? You have no sense of humor! It clogs the toilet! It didn't seem to clog it. Mu-shin. Hello? Mr. Kim. It's Lee Hyung-chul. Yes, sorry about the other day. I was out of line. Forgive me. It's just that I have a temper. It won't happen again. You know my sister's an angel. Give me another chance. I'll buy you a drink. When is a good time for you? Yes, I understand. I'm sorry. Take care. He's a real man. Mira. How'd you meet Mr. Kim? Come on, Mira. - Mira, you know how I am. - Let go. Come on, Mira. Should I just kill myself? I really want to straighten up my life. Right, Mu-shin? I really shouldn't do this to you. Mira. Mira! - Stop it. - My eyes! - What's wrong with you? - Where are you, Mira? - Mira. - Stop it! You're annoying me! Mira, cheer up. I'm really sorry? Stop it!? Mira. I'm sorry, Mira. Go away. Mu-shin! Grab my sister! Mu-shin! Grab my sister! # Every story is same. # When a day passes # I feel so tight. # Going away with nothing to say, # I feel so lonesome... Hyung-chul, buy some socks. You need some. Underwear, too. Come on. It's too flashy. It's weird. It's my choice, for my own wife. - How is it? - Pretty, real pretty. Choose this one for a blanket. It's a better design and color. This is for you Mira, and we would like this one. This is too thick. We already have winter blankets. Still, we need a new one for the new family member. - Like it? - Don't be silly! Is this your son and his wife? - Yeah? - You shouldn't speak that way. Honey, are you happy? One, two, three. Thank you. - Mira, take one, too. - I don't want to? - She's upset. - I don't want to? - Take one. - Come here! One more please. Come here. One, more naturally, one, two, three. Hyung-chul! Mommy. - What? - Mommy. You've gotten the wrong house. Your mom isn't here. Lee Hyung-chul, 138-43 Yaksadong, Chuncheon city Hey, look who's here! My princess! You came alone? You shouldn't travel so far alone. So good to see you. Mu-shin! Mu-shin! She came alone! I told you she's a genius. - Where's your daddy? - Dad's not here. Mommy! Go to your mommy. Come on, hold her. Oh no! Chae-hyun, get up. Chae-hyun, let's go. Where are you taking her this late in the night? Mom, let me sleep in the closet. Your mom isn't here. I'll take you home. Mu-shin. She has no place to go. Let her sleep here. It's okay. Mira, it's okay, right? She says it's okay. Let her sleep here. I'll take responsibility. You? Take responsibility? Why'd you give her the address? Come on, she's a good kid. I just told her to write me. Is that so bad? Who is she? Well, you see. Mu-shin's ex-husband's ex... Who was she again? She's Mu-shin's ex-husband's ex-wife's daughter, so to speak. Please stay out of this. Why wake up a sleeping child? You're crazy. Give her to me. Let it be. Take her home. She has no place to go! Why can't she live with us? She's so cute. We can afford to raise one kid, can't we? We would've had a baby anyway. This works out for us. Afford a kid? What can you do to afford anything? Aren't you out of hand to put me down in front of Mu-shin? I said I'll take care of everything. What have you taken care of so far? Always causing trouble and going to jail? That's enough. What do you want from me? Is that all my fault? I said, is it? Good-bye. Where the hell are you going? I won't let you! - Let me have her. - Why do you do this to me? After years without a word, why are you doing this to me again? Know why I couldn't come home? I feel suffocated looking at you. You know that? Mu-shin. Take him and the kid with you. You get out, too. This is no home. This isn't humane. Listen, ladies. Ladies, ladies. It's all my fault. I've done horrible things. But, what did the kid do? Just give me some time. I'll be responsible for everything. Lee Hyung-chul doesn't fall down that easy. I'm not easy to break. If I say I'd do it, I will. That's me! Mira, let's laugh it out. You're a good person. Laugh, Mu-shin. I need a drink very badly. I forgot to withdraw some money. Mu-shin, lend me some cash. Mira, I'm borrowing from you. I'll pay you back when I come back. Do you need anything? Mira, you like ice cream, right? I'll buy some. Mommy. Pretty Chae-hyun is awake. Good girl. You didn't even whine in your sleep. I'll bring back some candy. Wait one sec. Just count to a hundred. One. Two, Three, Four. Five, Six, Seven. I'll be on my way. Thank you for everything. If Hyung-chul comes back, let me know. If you hear from him, please let me know. Of course. Maybe if we wait... Sun-kyung, mommy needs to use your bathroom really bad. Get out. I really have to pee. - Get out. I mean it. - Where is it? You left home? And what's with this bag? Sun-kyung. You've got a nice place. How easy it is for you, mom. What? When I see you showing up like nothing happened, something snaps inside me. Sun-kyung. How strange. What suddenly made you think of me? He must've left you again. It's okay, you always find a new one soon. Get a new what? I think you've got a new one. Who is he? - Mom, I gotta go. I'm late. - Where are you going? - Let's go. - Where? - You go first, mom. - Oh goodness. Sun-kyung. Sun-kyung. It's used to decorate a building beautifully with geometrical lines and patterns in five colors. It also stands for a philosophy about the cosmos's five elements. What is it made of? Excuse me. Just a moment please. Joon-ho! How many years has it been? Almost a month. Only that much? Are you here to see me? No? Yes? What brings you here? - Sun-kyung. - Are you doing well? - Your girlfriend? - No. This is Yoo Sun-kyung. And this is my old schoolmate. - Nice to meet you. - Nice to meet you, too. She definitely seems like your girlfriend. Why are you being so shy? Darn, I thought you came to see me. How embarrassing. You got yourself a real pretty girl. I knew you were into looks. Congratulations! Yeah? Oops, I don't know why I'm congratulating. Sorry. Shall I take a picture of you? - Let's take one. All three of us. - No, no need. Excuse me, would you take a picture of us? Thank you. - What picture, drop it? - Come on. Now say Kimchi. Okay, smile. Kimchi! - Damn it, what is this? - Sun-kyung, please. Who are you? Do you know me? - Don't be like this. - Let go! Please. Your mother is ill. What? Your mom is very sick. So what? Sun-kyung. She got an incurable disease or something? How long she's got? A few months? So what did you come here for? Do you expect me to cry now? - So you've come for money. - Sun-kyung. Don't think about touching my share. Come with me. Go home to your family and stop wandering off. Stop harassing us. You'll pay for this, really. Well, that's it. You can go now. I have prepared for three years to get this job. I only eat Japanese food at home. Yes, I understand. Please excuse me. I really have to get out of this country. Is she in? I'm asking you where she is. You nuisance. Why don't you get what people say yet? Go home! Mommy! Did you have fun outside? Sun-kyung. Mom, I've been thinking all night. You owe me exactly 6,750,000 won. You'll pay me back, right? I don't have it. What are you talking about? You got plenty of money. I have to pay the hospital bills. Hey! Take off that watch. That's mine. Give me that. Come here. - You spoiled kid! Give it! - That's not yours. Stop it. This is mine. - I'm telling you it isn't. - You don't know. It's mine! Stop being so insistent. That's your problem, you know. Look who's talking. Dad gave this to me. Don't be insistent on what you don't know. What's gotten into you! Sun-kyung. Mind your own business, Mister. Stop it now! Isn't my Mom attractive? Think you're the only one who thinks that? My mom got men like you lined up. - What are you trying to say? - Don't you get it? Mom isn't the woman who'd settle for you. Mom will soon have another affair. You're old news now. - Stop it. - Let go! Please stop! - Stop! - Please stop! Are you alright? Yes. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Are you okay? Honey, I'm sorry. Sun-kyung, forgive me. You two are really disgusting. You deserve each other. - Ms. Yoo Sun-kyung. - Yes! Can you leave as soon as you're ready? Sure, I could go tomorrow if necessary. I'm always ready. Once you go abroad, you'll be gone a long time. Don't you have things to sort out? No, don't worry. I've already sorted everything out. Really? Fine then. Welcome aboard. Thank you, thank you. - Here, please fill this out. - Okay. My face looks puffy in this photo. I look better in person, don't you think? - Listen to me? - Let go of me. Stop. - Mae-ja, it's over now. - Forget it. Don't come here any more. Mae-ja. You bought this so you take it. You also bought this, but I'll keep it since I like it more. Take this, too. What else? Your girlfriend is very pretty. - She's not my girlfriend. - Of course she is. Did you sleep with her? I said she's not my girlfriend. That's your girlfriend. Nothing special. All done, you can go now. How could you be so selfish? What did I do? Why are you so cruel to me? So leave. Your girlfriend is nicer than this. I'm leaving. Take all of those. They're your collection. Sun-kyung. I really didn't come here to do this with you. Never mind, I'm going. Where to? You. Why do you treat me like this? Hey. - Hey! - Why are you doing this to me, then? Me? Why are you doing this to me? Me acting like this. You know this is how I am. Didn't you like me despite the fact that I'm cold and rude? What? You got sick of me? Stupid moron. Go. Just go! Go, go, go. Hey. Why have you changed like this? I didn't change. This is how I am. It's you who's changed. Admit it. Good-bye. Yeah, farewell, sons of bitches. It's been over a week. Where is it? What's going on? Are you playing with me? Mom. I guess we have no choice. We'll just have to die together. No need to say more. I got it. Just pay up tomorrow. No more delays. Five-dollar. - Special discount for you. - It's OK. - Four, four dollar, four. - No it's ok, It's ok. Bye. What a hard-working woman. Tell me. What? Whatever. You came to say something, didn't you? What makes you so smart? Think you're always right? I'm not. You're always like this. Always. What is that? Kyung-suk's homework. Don't just stand there. Help me color it. You do it alone. - How's your singing career going? - I quit singing. Why? You ran away from home to be a singer. I didn't leave for that. No? You really have no idea about me. I'm going far away. And I won't be back for long. Good for you. You always wanted that. Is it that you need money? I have money. Isn't it? He asked you, huh? Child, men don't come for money. Can't you see? Your mom is pretty. So how much does he want? What? Love? By any chance, is that guy waiting for you to die? You shouldn't say that. My goodness, I can't bear to look at you. Pathetic, really hopeless. You and him, too. And that poor kid, too. What is this? Live well off, at least. This is ridiculous, damn it. I won't die that soon. Sure, you'd say that. - Oh yeah, Sun-kyung. - What now? Tomorrow is Kyung-suk's field day at his kindergarten. Can you go to it? Why should I go there? Because I can't. That's something your Mister should be doing, isn't it? Why? He couldn't do that? Then why'd he let him be born? Never mind. Stop yelling. Don't go. Just forget it! Forget it! Right, forget it! I won't do this. Hey! What are you doing there? I can see you. Come out! Hey! - What's the matter? - Dizzy. - You feel dizzy? - Yeah. Let's see. Come out. Hey! Kid. I got you! Come out now. Open wider. Hey! You're so dead. You spit on me? You don't know how scary your sister is. Come here, you're dead. Kyung-suk! Faster! We won! Hurray! Hurray! I never thought you could run so fast! - Can I help you? - I've got something to tell you. Miss. What's going on? Oh, you. You got everything you need here. Honey, do you know her? Who are you? Mister, do you love my mom? I'm asking you. Do you love her? Yes, I love her. Dad? I love your mom. I mean it. Satisfied now? Sun-kyung, are you? Honey. What a couple. My mom and that man. Is love worth that much? To live cheating? Hey! Be quiet. He's like you. - Who? - Kyung-suk. What about him is like me? He's left-handed. And simple-minded. You don't know. I'm ambidextrous. It's been some time. He keeps asking me to sell everything, and travel together. I don't really want to. It's the same everywhere. Just more hardship away from home. Maybe it'll snow a lot this year. I like snow. Mom, she's leaving. What are you doing? - Sun-kyung. - What? - Will you go with me somewhere? - Mom, I don't have time. Please, come with me. I'm really busy! Stop it, kid. Sun-kyung. Go inside, will you? Damn it. Yes, of course. Smile! Kimchi! I had an urgent family matter. Yes, I have things to do here. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I don't know what else to say. I can't go. Yes, I just can't. Yeah, I'm a crazy bitch. So what? Yeah, I'm a crazy bitch. What? Ever done anything for me? I've got to talk to you. Why did you lend him the money? Not again! Yeah! Again! Don't be like that. We can help out people in need. Just drop it. I really can't communicate with you. All I want to say is that you're too good to people. You see, that's... Why are you looking at me that way? Think I'm being jealous right now? You know that I don't get jealous over stuff like that. What? Do you by any chance like Sang-geun? What's wrong with you? What's wrong with my attitude? - Asking me 'cause you don't know? - No, I don't. I don't mind if you go out to drink with Sang-yup. But why do you have to pay for it? Enough, no more! That's what's wrong with my attitude? That's the problem? Look! You're not even listening to me now. Then what? - Why do you... - Wait! You're stepping on a flower. What's gotten into you? What's more important now? Me or the flower? It's just that the flower was getting crushed. They don't like you. They're using you. You're too easy. Stop it. Hey! Hey! Hello? What? Tell me if you need anything else. Aren't you tired? I don't think he needs us anymore. Right, let's go. You're not leaving? Let's go. Shall we? - We'll leave now. - Thank you for coming. - Are you going to be fine? - I'm okay. What am I going to do now? Thanks for your help. You should go. I'm sorry. Go. Thanks for your help. Kyung-suk. I think I'll have to stay a little longer. Okay. Kyung-suk! Have you seen my pearl brooch? Don't you ever knock? How could you just barge in? Knocking for what between family? - Anyway, what are you doing? - Making something. - Wow, what is it? - I'll show you later. It's a secret. I can see through you. You're breaking something again. No, you'll be surprised when you see it later. My goodness, what a mess! Go get a girlfriend rather than being locked up in the room all day. Oh yeah, I'm gonna be on TV. - Why? - Because I'm pretty. - Sis. - What? - I'm seeing someone. - Really? That's a big surprise. - Who's the girl? - You don't know her. But I don't know. What? Whether she likes me or not. Of course she does. - How would you know? - Because you like her. So do others. Others like her? Or she likes others? Both ways. Is that so? I would have to see her. A woman can read another woman with one look. Hey, so you're gonna get married before me? Of course you should get married first. I like only dating. Is that good? You don't know anything, do you? Who would like a guy like this? You're sentimental, naive. And with a trashy room, girls will run away from you. I'm perfectly normal. It's you who's weird. - What about me? - You're just like Mom. What do you know about her? I know. She was pathetic. She wasn't pathetic. She had a big heart. Come in, there's a lot of food. - Something special about today? - Hyun-ah's birthday. Why does she have her birthday party here? Her place is under repair. - Let's go inside. - Happy birthday! - Come in, Kyung-suk! - Come inside! Join us. Chae-hyun is in danger. This guy's been flirting with her. His eyes changed since he got drunk. No, you're crazy! Don't believe her! - What happen? - Hey! Where have you been? Never answering my calls. Why did you come here? Shouldn't you take care of Hyun-ah since she got drunk? You reek of alcohol? - My head hurts? - You drink, you get a headache. Know how long I've waited for you here? You should take care of me today. - Alright. - It's cold. Let's have dinner at my place with my sister. Okay! When? - You can come? - Sure. Of course! Come on Sunday. You're giving me that look. Do I look that pretty? You stink. Your breath stinks of garlic. You! Can't you concentrate on me a little more? Concentrating. You should look pretty while drunk, but you stink of garlic. I love you, too. Very much. I'm embarrassed of you. Very very much. Really embarrassed. No, don't! Stop it! Come on, hurry. We have a good appetite, don't you think? This is beef. It's no good if it's overcooked. Here. It's hot. I'm sorry. - For what? - Everything. You dummy! - Why? - It's okay. Eat some vegetables, too. You're still not eating right. You just told me to eat the beef. This mushroom is expensive. Eat a lot of it. Here. What happened? Hello! I'm sorry for the trouble. Young-ho had suddenly disappeared. Hello. Young-ho, come to Daddy. I'll give you two a ride. Hop in. What happened was that I was on my way on a bus when... - Hurry, Chae-hyun! - Okay. Come on, Kyung-suk. Hey! What are you doing? - What are you doing? - I'm sorry. Chae-hyun, what's wrong with him? Why do you ask her about what I did? I'm the one who did this. So why are you asking Chae-hyun? What do you think you're doing? I think I've done it. Why do you have to ask Chae-hyun? - Why do you have to ask Chae-hyun? - What's wrong with you? What's the matter with you? What's wrong with you? How could you do this to me? Let's break up. You shouldn't say things like that easy. It's not an easy thing to say. Do you want to come in? I'm gonna go. - Stay over. - I'd rather go. But, why is it you who should look for his kid? I told you. I'm the only one who knows his hide-outs. Why is it you who only knows? Young-ho is a lonely kid. He's somebody else's lonely kid. Is Young-ho your kid? Huh? Don't be like this. - Are you his wife? - Stop. Why didn't you call? I think I lost my mobile running around looking for him. It means nothing to you that my sister is worried? - You know it's not like that. - I don't know. That's not true. You don't like me. You couldn't be so indifferent to someone you care about. I'm sorry. For what? For everything. You still don't know what you should be sorry about. When I'm with you, I'm dying of loneliness. It doesn't have to be me for you. Don't say that. I can understand why your ex-boyfriend left you. I'm fed up. Do you have a boyfriend? Sometimes yes, sometimes no. - How about now? - He ran away. He told me I was crazy. I rather find crazy girls attractive. Yes, Tae-shik. That? Don't worry so much. Yes, pay me back when you can. I don't need it so soon. Yes. Hello, Tae-shik. This is Kyung-suk. How do you feel? That's good. By the way, stop whining. You're not the only one suffering. Things are harder for us. And pay Chae-hyun back soon. - Just the money? - What? Money is all you gave him? It doesn't concern you anymore. Why? Why doesn't it concern me? Why? Kyung-suk. You know I'm easy. Please stop. Chae-hyun! Sure it's here? Hold on. Don't move from there. Hold still. - Why? - Answer me. Don't move. - Answer me. - Okay! My arms hurt. Three. Four. Five. Wow. I found it. The treasure. Where? Right here. Come on. - I'm serious. - Forget it. Look here. Wow. This watch. Its alarm has never rung. My sister said that the alarm would ring if it's near the treasure. You're the treasure. I'm gonna feel bad. Why you? I've waited my whole twenty years waiting for the treasure. Thank you. Thank you. Kyung-suk. Anyhow, is it so bad to be easy? Go inside. Bye. I'll tell my mom that I became a treasure. Can you give me a kiss? Never mind. Next time we meet... I'm really leaving now. Who are you? I'm late. I'm sorry. Who are you? Huh? It's not even a holiday. What brings you here? Stop joking. Let's go inside. Ah-ha! So this is the boy! Nice to meet you. He's just passing by. Who did you look after to be so shy? I'm so nervous because she brought such a nice boyfriend. Oh, goodness. You look so sophisticated. Stay for dinner. No, thank you. I should get going. Don't be shy. Come in. It's okay. Mom! Let him go. We broke up. We broke up. Good-bye. So what? You don't eat if you break up? People break up, but still eat and live well. It's okay, breaking up... No big deal. Everyone breaks up. But you still have to eat. I'm fine. You're still going to eat. Don't worry. - I'm just... - It's no big deal. Mu-shin! A man came to our house! What? A man? Tada! Who is he? How do you do? I'm Choi Kyung-suk. Chae-hyun is such a good girl. Where did she pick up this fine worker? Wow, he looks eccentric! This must be your birthday present. Anyhow, I brought her up well, my Chae-hyun. You brought her up? I did. What did you do? I brought her up. What have you done? You're getting senile. I brought you back every time you ran away! When did I ever run away? Not you. This old hag. Old hag? Who are you calling an old hag? Call me Sis. Call me Sis. Yes, Sister. Gosh, will you stop? I'm starving. Look, when did her butt get so firm and big? This young man would've seen it all already. That's why you broke up, isn't it? Yeah? No, we're not that kind of friends. - They broke up? - They said they broke up. Good. You'll stay for the night, won't you? Oh, no. You can sleep in my room with me. You're absolutely senile. Why would he sleep in your room when mine's bigger? You stay out of it. Not again, you old witches. I thought you two broke up. Don't pay attention to us. Go worry about your boyfriend. How perfect! I've been feeling rather bored. # Happy birthday to you. # Happy birthday to you. - # Happy birthday, Dear Mommy. - # Mushy. Don't call me that. # Happy birthday to you. Light put out a candle. Now for presents! Chae-hyun, hand them over. - Oh my! - It's knitted so well. - Look how pretty it is. - She's got talented hands, like me. Put it on. Right, right. This way, is it? This is right? It must've been quite a work for Chae-hyun. That's strange. - It barely covers my stomach. - The back is wide open. It shows? I'm sorry. I'll finish it tomorrow. Someone kept interrupting me, so I couldn't finish it. That's okay! I'm generous enough to wait longer. Still, it's the perfect color for me. - It's too stylish for your age. - Don't talk nonsense. A short sweater makes my legs look longer, no? Wow, this is the trend nowadays? Chae Yeon knitted this for me before, right? - Mine is knitted much better. - Excuse me. Can I give you a present, too? Present? This, here. What is this? What is this? - Oh, this is so unique. - How cute. These are arms and legs? - This one looks like me. - Let me see. I see no resemblance at all. Check me out. Oh no, three grandmas. One, two, three. - Mommies, give me some more rice. - Sure, sure. You're too lazy. Don't scold her for nothing. Bring her a big bowl. This is something special. Know someone on TV? There, she is my sister up there. That woman in the front? No, not her. Two rows away from her. And then, the second person behind. - Yeah, you look like her. - Don't we? Where? She sings very nice. Yes, she does. Yes, I brought it as a birthday present. No, I bought it! Mom, let me try a piece. - See if it needs more salt. - Yeah. It's perfect if I made it. My Kimchi is famous for its taste. - Mom, it's a bit salty. - What? She said it's salty. It's perfect! Feed this young man. - You have a big mouth. - How is it? Salty, huh? It's good, huh? Perfect? - Not salty? - Isn't it just right? Delicious, no? - It must be salty. - Tasty, huh? Perfectly seasoned. Mom! Mom! Mu-shin. You're all still here. Time sure has passed. These two pretty girls have gotten old. But you're still pretty. Hey, know who I am? Sis, I should've called you sooner. What are you waiting for? Come inside! Say hello. This is my sister Mira? That I mentioned. This is... Just Mu-shin. This is Mi-yeon. I felt sorry for her, so I brought her with me. Come here. - Say hello. - Hyung-chul! Nice to meet you, A moment... - What? - Hold on. Is something wrong? Careful. - Open the door. - Go inside. - Go inside. - Sis! Mu-shin! Stop joking. Unlock the gate! What's wrong? Oh, my... Sis, you can't do this. Hey, kid! Don't know you are, but open up and introduce yourself! - Hey! - Yeah!
