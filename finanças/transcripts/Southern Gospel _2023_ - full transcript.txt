I forgot. - Sister Abernathie, she's, uh, she's at her wit's end. Your behavior has been off. And you better do right in that classroom today, or I'll ground you for another week, you understand me? - Yes, sir. - Look, I was a preacher's kid, too. But you got to do right, son, 'cause if you don't, I'ma have to talk to my friend, Gary, the Goose. Oh, man, he's hungry. - Daddy, no! Please, no! - He's so hungry. - No, please! No! - He's hungry! (both laughing) (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - (Samuel) Daddy, who parked in your spot? - Go on in, son. - And things like cussing will get you there. The word of God says, "Let your conversation be holy." The word says, "Be ye holy as I am holy." (upbeat music) What, Samuel? - I know you said cussing will get you in, but what if you, like, just tried it once, and you didn't really mean it? What if Jesus came back right then? - Come here. (upbeat music continues) Come right here. Then, boy, you'd bust wide open. (congregation applauding) (bright music) - Ma'am. - (sighs) What, Samuel? - Can I go to the bathroom? - Hurry back. - The Lord looks on the heart. Now, the GCO guidebook says no swimming, no makeup, no worldly music, no going to the picture show. - That's right. - Yes. - And there's probably a million people in this organization who follow those rules to tee. - I do, Pastor. - I know you do, Zachary. I know you do. (congregation chuckling) But what about those people that are following those rules on the outside, but they're doing something different on the inside? Right, someone who wouldn't dare touch a bottle of whiskey, and yet they walk around drunk on their own pride. (congregation muttering) God looks on the heart. Someone who wouldn't even think about lighting up a single cigarette, but their heart is burnt up with jealousy. (congregation muttering) See, because God, he knows how to spot a fake. And if we don't tell him every single day how we fail, and we need his help, then our own hearts will go astray. - Oh yes. - Amen. - 'Cause where religion fails and where people fail, God will never, and I mean never fail.

That's quite a little show you put on there this morning. - It's our church state overseer. He tells everybody what to do. - (Joe) What do you need? - God's Church Organization is growing by the hour. Lord's returning any day. We just need to make sure that all of our pastors are preaching what they ought to be preaching. - I haven't gotten any complaints. - Mm. I have. Brother Wilburn let his whole family go swimming. Mixed bathing encourages lust. Well, God's Church, we show the way. - We can't just throw a rule book at 'em and tell 'em to change. See, you and I, um, we're different. - Like Cain and Abel. - You're a professional. I'm just a boy that God found out in a cotton field. When I was 14, your daddy asked me to come and tell my story. - Yeah. Small town nothing. - Maybe, but I got ambition. Raise my son. Lead my people. - Your people? They're my people. My daddy ain't gonna live forever. Remember that. - None of us do. (brooding music) - We'll see who's smiling in the end. (engine starting) (brooding music continues) - Watch out for that bush!

(paper rustling) (clock ticking) It's time. - Daddy, I've been thinking a lot. I think I know why Momma died with my little brother in her belly. - Hey. Remember, we don't question Lord in those matters. You know that. - Daddy, I cussed a few times. On purpose. - Samuel, stop. - It's my fault. - Samuel. Samuel, look at me. Now, what you said right there, that's not true. Your mother had complications with the baby. - But Sister Abernathie said I was going to because I cussed. - Well, you know what? I don't think Sister Abernathie knows what she's talking about. Oh! I just said it too, huh? (bright music) I'm gonna have to give her a little talking to.

Thank you. Uh... I've never met someone like you. (Samuel chuckles) - You drank two milkshakes. - Ah! You kept count? - I was just, I was nervous you were gonna try and get mine.

Can I get the, the check? (Julie laughs) I'll keep that sticker on my guitar 'cause it reminded me of the life I knew I was supposed to be living. I thought about you, and I was certain I lost the chance to love someone as special as you. Julie, I wanna build a life with you. And we, we could build a different kinda church, from scratch, our own. Not about a bunch of manmade rules. One that reaches people as lost as I was, built on grace. - That's a beautiful dream. But, um, I mean, did I, did I miss a question in there somewhere? - (Samuel) Yeah, maybe.

And that man will never touch you again. - He's violent, Samuel, and you're, you're so sweet, but you just, you don't know him. - I know myself. He'd have to kill me. - You're serious? - Do I look like I'm not? - Well, the answer is yes. (gentle music) (bright music) - (Samuel) I guess I owe you a ring, then. - You know, I always knew we'd get married someday. - I thought you were gonna marry Jody Barnes. - Well, yes. Him or you. (both laughing) (bright music continues) (congregation applauding) - Give the Lord a praise. It's good to be here in God's Church Sayre. - (Congregation) Amen. - Brother Joe has preached many fine messages from this pulpit. And I am sad that he has chosen to retire. But, uh, I do believe that Brother Malachi from Louisiana has done a fine job as a interim pastor, and I'm sure that he will do a fine job as a permanent pastor. - All Right. - Amen. - But not ever pastor is like Brother Joe Allen. He has remained faithful. Now, I understand that he doesn't want to come up here today. I understand that. But his son Samuel is here. And boy, have I been hearing some things about this young man and the call that's on his life. Samuel, would you come up here and share a little bit with us today? - All right, preacher man. (congregation applauding) - If I can't hear my favorite pastor, I wanna hear his son. - (Congregation) Yeah. - Thank you. (congregation applauding) Thanks. A little over a year ago, um, I was in a motel room in Charlotte after a show. I was high on cocaine. I was with a woman I had just met. $1,000 on the dresser. Just cut my first record. But I was dying inside. No, no, no, I know we don't, we don't talk about this kinda stuff in church. But I don't know why. I knew my life was broken. I just didn't know how to fix it. So I tried everything. The prodigal son. Now, prodigal doesn't mean wild and crazy. It means wasteful. - (Congregation) That's right. That's right. - But that was me, I was, I was on this far-off land just wasting every good thing that God gave me. I just need to remember that I got a real dad that loves me. - Yes. - Amen. - But I'm, I'm blessed because I have a Heavenly Father that loves me even more. - Amen. (congregation applauding) - That, that is still hard for me to comprehend. - Preach it. Preach it. (congregation applauding) - Don't waste the love that God has given you. Since he forgave me, I'm positive that he can forgive you. (congregation applauding) Just surrender to his love.

Now, I understand that what happened up there today is not what we expected. And Brother Malachi, I wanna thank you for your willingness to relocate from Shreveport. But I have made a decision. Samuel will be the new pastor of this church. - Dad, come on. - Now, I know he's a little young. - 1 Timothy says an elder should not be a recent convert. - And it says in the next chapter, "Let no man despise thy youth." (T.L. scoffs) Brother Malachi has a church. Now, I know he's your friend, but he'll be fine. - Daddy, the boy's got the devil in him. Always has, always will. - That young man has got something on his life. Now, what happened up there, shoot, I almost went up there and got saved myself. It's a little edgy. We might need a little edgy where we are in this world right now. How do you feel about this, Samuel? - If you believe in me, I'll do it. - This is the GCO Handbook. Memorize it. Learn the rules. Without rules, there's no order, and without order, there is chaos. Stick to the rules. - Yes, sir. (gentle music) - Well, I don't think anybody has left yet.

(brooding music) I can't. - What do you mean? - I, uh... I- I shouldn't have called you over here. This is the old me. I'm just, uh, I'm just lonely. (brooding music continues) - Here. - No, keep it. - Well. Don't change too much. You're one of the sweetest people I know. Next one's on me, Barry. - God. Get outta here. (brooding music continues) (Barry sighs) (brooding music continues) - (sighs) I'm trying. I'm trying. (brooding music continues) (camera shutter clicking) Hey! (camera shutter clicks) Why are you following me and taking pictures? What you trying to do, huh? - I got you now. Pictures of that going up to your room, huh? (groans) Oh, and now the liquor. Now a Black burnout assaulting an upstanding citizen. Samuel's going down. You too, Barry. - Get your stuff and get outta here, you redneck. Get outta here! (door creaking) (ominous music) (ominous music continues) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - It's me, brother. - Barry. Barry, what is it? Oh, you know. Same old story. - Um, hey, hold on. Where are you? Where are you at? - That's a deep question. At the bottom of a well. (sobs) I can see the light, but I just can't reach it. It's too far away T.L. Whittmore had a goon following me, taking pictures of me, drinking, and with a prostitute. But I ain't go through with it. I'm different now. But, uh, I messed it up for you. (ominous music continues) They said they're gonna take your church. - That doesn't matter right now, Barry. - When I get sad, I drink. (ominous music continues) I can't fix it, brother. I love you, brother. - I love you too, Barry. God loves you. Um... (ominous music continues) Look, um, we're just gonna get through this. I need you to tell me where you are, Barry. You have to tell me, please. - I'm sorry. I let you down. - You didn't let me down, Barry. Barry. Barry? (gun cocking) Barry? (gunshot bangs) (sirens wailing) (brooding music) (sirens wailing) (brooding music continues) (somber music) (thunder rumbling) (somber music continues) (somber music continues) - (Samuel) Mr. Whittmore. I thought that might be you when I saw that car. - (T.L.) Is that right? - Hey, you and those Cadillacs. - Is there some place we can talk? We got a problem. (thunder rumbling) I've been watching you over the years since your so-called conversion. - So-called? - Hmm. There ain't a thing sacred about the way you do church, son. (thunder rumbling) Worldly music. Weirdos. It seems like you think, just 'cause you run three services a Sunday, that somehow you're justified. - Everyone deserves a second chance. - Shame Barry didn't get one. Drunk usher one day, kills himself the next. - You don't get to bring him up. You don't know anything about Barry. - I know you refuse to preach sanctification. Hmm? (T.L. sniggers) Your daddy was a grace man. Look at him now. - You want me to preach that people lose the ability to make a mistake after they come to the Lord? - It's mighty close to the line, son. - Matter of fact, it's over the lie. - Oh, you made up the line. You're gonna try and tell me that, in 30 years of ministry, you've never made one mistake? - Not a one! Holiness. Look it up. - That's the problem. I have. - A sinner like you wouldn't understand. (thunder rumbling) - "I was shown mercy so that in me, the worst of sinners, Christ Jesus might display his immense patience." - "And these shall go away into everlasting punishment, but the righteous into life eternal." - "He has not punished us as we deserve for all our sins, for his mercy toward those who fear and honor him is as great as the height of the heavens above the earth." - "They that have done evil will come upon the resurrection of damnation, for the wages of sin is death." - It's sad. You've clearly memorized it, but you, you don't understand it. - You wanna hit me, boy? Prove what I already know about you. (thunder rumbling) You're out! I believe the Pope calls it excommunicated. Hmm. No one from the GCO will ever speak to you again. Brother Malachi will move into the parsonage and take over this Saturday, all right? You're finished. (brooding music) (thunder rumbling) - Barry's death is on you. - I wasn't his pastor. You were. (brooding music continues) (door slams) - Daddy will just be a minute, okay? He's saying goodbye to Poppa. - Mm-hmm. - Okay. - Hey, don't let 'em make you bitter. (melancholy music) - Yeah. - You can only love the Lord as much as the person you love least. - Dad, they took our legacy. - Your legacy? Your legacy's right here. It's right out there in that car. It's anywhere God leads you, as long as you keep your heart right. - We're, uh, we're gonna go to Florida. We like it down there. Disney World and everything. - Yeah. That'll be good. - So we'll just start over. (melancholy music continues) - Here's $5,000. - Dad. - Nope. Take it. - Dad. It's just been waiting on a rainy day. It's yours. - Dad. Thank you. Come with us. - Oh, I can't come with you. I belong here. Your mom and I built this place. It's your time. - I love you. - I love you too.

(laughs) - (Julie) Thanks. - (Waitron) Can I get you anything else? - No, thank you. - (Waitron) All right. (upbeat music continues) - So what was that about? - Dom Rivera there just offered us a job. - What? Who's Dom Rivera? Oh, he's a businessman. He wants to become the main act at his new nightclub, but, ah, he wants a one-year contract. - (chuckles) Oh, that's good news, right? - You want me to take the job? I mean, I- I- I- I- I thought this was temporary. W- we have to start the church to prove to all the T.L. Whittmores of the world that our way works, too. - I'm sorry, Okay? I just need a minute. - Hey! Julie. Julie! Hey, you are causing a scene. Julie. Julie, what's going on with you? (Julie sighs) - I saw my daddy at the grocery store today. - Oh, baby, you know that's not possible. - He was just standing there, (somber music) staring at me like a ghost. - Baby, there's no such thing as ghosts. (somber music continues) Look, I'm fighting for our dream. I still want our own church. - You... I don't know if I do. - Look, you might've had too much wine. - Don't do that. Our life was stolen from us. Oh, but th- th- th- this is easy. We're playing music, we get paid, we sing, we go home. Repeat, do it again, no one judging. - Well, maybe it is, but you knew who I was when you married me. - I know, I did, I did. I just didn't know who I was. Samuel, I... (somber music continues) (somber music continues) I was only five years old the first time that my daddy crawled into my bed. And I... (somber music continues) So don't tell me that there's no such thing as ghosts. (somber music continues) (birds twittering) (TV blaring) (TV blaring continues) (TV blaring continues) (gentle music) - (knocking) Julie? (knocking) Julie? (Julie sobbing) - Can you please shut the door? (somber music) - Baby, I'm worried about you. You've been in here a week, and you haven't eaten. I d- I don't know what to do. - I need some time. I just can't get everything out of my head. - Look, if you don't talk to me, then- - Samuel, I need you to just leave me alone. - Well, can you at least just tell me what I can do? (somber music continues) - Can you rewrite history? Can you undo what my daddy did to me? Or can you give us our old life back? (somber music continues) - No. (somber music continues) I can love you. I can pray for you. - Then just do that. (somber music continues) (telephone ringing) - Hello? - (Caller) Could I speak with Samuel, please? - Yeah, this is him. - (Dr. Emmett) This is Dr. Emmett from the hospital. I served in the war with your father. Son, your daddy had a heart attack. I'm sorry to tell you, he didn't make it. - Uh- - I'm sorry, son. He was a good man. (somber music continues) (somber music continues) (somber music continues) (somber music continues) (birds twittering) (somber music) - "Often I dream of your kindness. Daily I dream of your touch. Oceans won't quell my desire. My darling, I miss you so much." Dad, you were a poet? (somber music continues) (somber music continues) - (Joe) Today my boy got in trouble. I got a call this morning, not from the police department in Weems, where he was arrested, but from T.L. Whittmore. He told me my son was in a bit of trouble, and he wanted me to meet him in a coffee shop in Weems. I wanted to help my son. He wanted to cut a deal. (Samuel gasps) (somber music continues) (suspenseful music) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) - Read September 29th, 1969. You're right. I can't rewrite history, but I can change the future. - Wait. Samuel, please, where are you going? (suspenseful music continues) (engine starting) Sammy! Sam! (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) (suspenseful music continues) - I'm coming. (coughs) Lord Almighty, who... Samuel. - September 29th, 1969. You made a deal with my dad. Now you tell me what happened. I just wanna hear you say it. Say it! - I told your daddy that if he walked away from the GCO, I'd have your charges dropped. Judge in Weems is my brother-in-law. - Whats wrong with you? You took the one thing from my father that he loved more than anything in the world. - No. You got that wrong. - Is that right? - Yeah. He loved you more. (gentle music) Oh, uh... (gentle music continues) - Poppa, who is this? - Um, hey, I'm just here to talk to your grandpa for a, for a minute. - Yeah, run on. (gentle music continues) Go on back inside. (clears throat) He's my grandson. After Babsie died, I hadn't been doing so well. My daughter's been helping take care of me. I got a few months, I guess. I'm gonna pay for my debts, Samuel. (somber music) I will. I already am. I don't even... I don't, I don't deserve forgiveness. I know that. (somber music continues) - You never even asked for it. (Samuel sighs) (somber music continues) Look, no one deserves forgiveness. It's just something we receive, like a gift. T.L., I've been there. - (scoffs) No. No, I'm afraid not, son. You haven't been here. - Look, God forgave me at my lowest. My bitterness toward you is no better than the things you did to me. (gentle music) I forgive you. (gentle music continues) - I don't know what to say. (gentle music continues) (Samuel sniggers) - Well, that's a first. (gentle music continues) - Yeah, yeah, I reckon it is. (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) - (Samuel) (knocking) Julie? (somber music) (somber music continues) When I met you, you shone like a thousand stars. (somber music continues) But I never knew how much you've been hurt. (somber music continues) I'm not gonna like you get sucked under that current. I'm holding onto you. If you go, I go. (somber music continues) I don't have a dream without you in it. So I, I did take the, the job at the club, and, um, I also took a, took a side job working on the railroad with Reyna's brother to pay off our debt. (somber music continues) Just know I'm here for you. And I should've what you were going through. (somber music continues) I'm sorry. I'm still praying for you. I love you. (somber music continues) (Julie sobbing) (somber music continues) (somber music continues) - (Foreman) All right, guys. We're gonna take a long break. (gentle music) 45 minutes. (gentle music continues) - "For all the land which thou seest, to thee will I give it, and to thy seed forever." (gentle music continues) (gentle music continues) Everything I see, huh? Hey, boss! - Allen, can't you see I'm resting? - Yeah, sorry, uh... Hey, what if I told you that the Lord said he was gonna gimme everything I see right now? - Well, I say, as long as you ain't looking at me, you can have it. - Where are we? - (Foreman) St. Cloud. - St. Cloud. - Yeah. And you can have it. ♪ Sinking in the deep ♪ ♪ Standing on a ledge ♪ ♪ But you ♪ ♪ You still love me ♪ - It's beautiful. - Uh, you scared me. - Sorry. - It's okay. I shoulda come to bed. - No, it's okay. You worked really hard. - Yeah, it's, it's harder than I thought. - You know, my daddy, my daddy said that no one would ever love me once they found out what he'd done to me. And I wanted to tell you, but I loved you and I got scared. But you protected me. You believed in me. I, uh... I read your daddy's journals. (gentle music) He called your destiny his Promised Land. Okay, he knew what he was doing when he walked away. (sighs) I got lost somewhere along the way. But you kept loving me. And you said you prayed for me. And this morning I woke up and I, (sighs) I felt hope. And I prayed for us. Samuel Allen, It is time for me to believe in you. (rousing music) - I don't wanna do it without you. (rousing music continues) - You won't have to. (rousing music continues) (rousing music continues) (rousing music continues) (birds twittering) - Hey, Julie, did you get my guitar picks off the table? - Yeah, I got 'em. - (Samuel) All right, sorry, I'm just, um, I'm a little nervous. - Dad, are, are we moving? - Uh, well, son, we only got invited to minister. - If we move, can I get a bigger room? - Hey, I want a bigger room too! - Kids, I don't know that we're moving. - Aw! - What exactly did the man say? - He's part of the advisory board. Their pastor left, and they asked us to fill in till decisions are made on a new pastor. - A pastor like you. - We're the Allen family, and, uh, we're gonna sing a song for you. (birds twittering) My, my friend wrote this song. Uh, th- this wasn't planned, but I'm gonna sing it.

Please welcome Pastor Samuel Allen. (congregation applauding) - Thank you so much. Thank you. Well, thank you. Thank you. You have no idea what an honor it is for us to be here with you today. My wife, Julie, my kids, Jesse, Mia, We appreciate you having us. I just, I wanna tell you something. You may have been pushed around, beat up, run over, cheated on. - (Congregant) Amen. - Maybe you've done those things to someone else. I'm just here to say that there is always hope. And I'm not, I'm not sure what your story is, but today I am here to say that you never give up on the dream that God has given you. Trust in him. Could y'all look at your, look at your neighbor? Yeah, look at your neighbor, and just say, "It's time to dream again." (congregation chattering) God bless you. - Thank you. - (Samuel) Thank you. - (Julie) God bless. - Thank you. - Thanks for coming. - (Samuel) Yeah, thank you so much. God bless. - Thank you. Thank you again. - I'm so proud of you. - Thank you. Thanks. Thank you. God bless you. - Well, Pastor Samuel, it has been very nice to meet you. I'm sold. You have an incredible family. Everyone here obviously loves you. You are gonna build a great church here. - W- w- what do, what do you mean? - When the pastor of this church left, it was legally turned over to our advisory board, and someone of great influence, who wished to remain unnamed, paid the mortgage off on this place with the stipulation that you must become our new pastor. (gentle music) That's how we found you. Somebody thinks very highly of you, so I'm gonna be here at 9:00 AM to turn over all the paperwork. If you want it, this place is yours. - I can't believe it. Um, I mean yes. Yes, of course. I mean, of course we want it, more than anything in the world. - You just preached a wonderful sermon on dreams. I don't think you should be surprised by this, Pastor Samuel. (gentle music) Welcome. - Never surrender the dream. - Never. - Thank you. - Thank you. (gentle music continues) (both laughing) - (Julie) That's amazing! (laughs) (gentle music continues) - Kids! Come here! (gentle music continues) - Win the world, son. Win the world.
