Leo are tough people. My horoscope says I'll be fine. And my luck! Will shape UP! I hope you mean it. I'm worried about you. I'm fine...bye. Daisy, my cousin bought this beach. Last year he needed cash. And sold me half for HK$1 million. I helped him out of kindness. Now it's reward time. A developer wants it! There's always hope. Are you happy for me? Sure! No one answers, please call back. So you'll fly to Malaysia? Of course! Answer the phone, cousin. Malaysia, Airport Terengganu. It's so hot! MORE MORE TEA INN It's mine! Hello? Ready? Yes, fine. Damn! No problem! They're getting married! Any objections? Any objections, please say now. You're asked already. You're in a hurry? Different dialects for different guests.

Help! You're okay. Hi! You were reckless. I could sue you. You're so typical Hong Kong! I don't talk to hicks. Don't follow me. It's not your beach! It is too! Cousin! - Cousin! - Thank you! Your cousin lives here? My cousin is the owner. I don't have a cousin. You're the owner? Yes! So my cousin was broke. You gave him money to flee. In return. You got half the beach and the hut? Yes! He's my best friend. He fled months ago. He didn't tell you? Let's call the police. What for? I think you're conning me. But I'm not stupid. I'm calling you bluff. I'm not a conman. I have proof. No kidding! The deed's at my lawyer's. Let's go now. No problem! Let's go! How? That's my ride? It's a half-hour walk. Or 5 minutes by bike. What's wrong? This can't be right. You call this a deed? Yes! Your cousin was in huge debts. He asked me for help. So, I signed these papers. Lucky you! This deed says. Mr. More gave your cousin Rm 500,000. To settle his debts. So he gave More half of the beach. And half of the hut. You're joking, aren't you? Lawyers don't joke. These papers are legally valid. You each own half. No more arguments. This is a bad day. You're my partner. You're welcome to stay. What an ignorant hick. Wasting my time. Roger, was that fish 40 lb.? More like... 600! 60 lb., not 600. I'll buy your half for Rm 600,000. I'll have no place to swim. I'll buy your half. You're that rich? Call me when you go fishing. Tomorrow night? I got a boat; Peter and Robert will join. That place is full of fish. You can see them swimming. Absolutely amazing... Are you there? I told you in e-mail. My corporation wants to buy your beach. To build a large resort. See! Mr. Chan's idea is great. Will I get free suites? You sound interested. Yes, I'll sell you half the beach. It's a bargain. You said half the beach? Yes, you have a deal. A damn good one. Is it the left, or the right half? The front or the back? UP W you'.! You're insincere. All right! How about 3 million? Malaysian Ringgits? No... US dollars! US dollars? US dollars! Think it over, and call us. It's not the only beach around. We have other choices. Stop, I must talk to you. You still don't understand? Just say you love me. We can start over. There's another woman! Am I right? Who is she? Tell me! Honey, sorry I'm late, let's go! - Okay! _ Hey! You! He loves me, not you. - Okay, let's go. - Right! More! I really like you! Don't overact! You go to hell! We won't be going there. Sorry! You're more humorous than my ex. I'm a better man. Seriously, US$300,000. Okay? Not bad! You'll be rich. What's with this beach? None of your business. Just tell me, are you selling? Isn't it US$3 million? Mr. Chan talked to me, too! I like one thing about you. Calculating! All right! Since you know it all. $1.5 million each. Okay? That's a fortune. Let's swim! Be serious! I am! Heavens, what do you want? You're still here? Tell me why you won't sell. Look! If this becomes a private resort. They won't have a place to... To what? Play! Can't you buy another beach? Listen! I grew up on this beach. Learned to swim and dive here. Fist date, first kiss. First... All right! You have a lot of memories here. So what? It's not only the memories. It's a part of me. Someone dumped garbage here once. I was ill for 4 days. Really? Anyway, I love this beach. Unless it can be replaced by a deeper love. US $1.5 million should do. I don't need money. I just want to be happy. But I need money. What? You're happy and sensitive. Just a bit to stubborn. Anyway, I'll convince you. So, you're staying? Good. No hot showers? I'll freeze! R's 38'!) outside'.! The house is not air-conditioned. So you won't freeze! You're not wearing makeup? Scary, huh? You're beautiful! "It's over!" "Love is over!" "What's gone is gone." "No big deal!" "We're no happy!" "Not anymore!" At the last second. "We hugged, kissed, cried!" "Happy or not!" "Doesn't really matter!" "At the last second!" "We're together!" Daisy! Play that song again, I'll sing. It's so boring here. I can only remain sane by singing. - What? - What? No, not sold yet! My cousin sold his half to a hick! He says, unless there is a deeper love. Isn't that crazy? - What? - I said crazy! Talk louder! It's noisy here! Have you found that 3rd person? Who's George with? What? Hello? I'm so sorry! Miss! How dare you? A sun...beautiful! I saw a fly buzzing around you. It might fly into your throat. And affect your sing. So I drove it away. Snake! Elephant! Slap her until she can't speak. Sure! Help! Easy! You're protecting her? Can't let you bully a girl. Hercules! Zeneger! Yes! I'm Hercules, small but strong. I'm Zeneger. Schwarzeneger's...fan. We're talking you on. Be my guest! Zip UP! Aren't you in pain? Of course! It hurts! Go to hell! You'll regret this. I'll get you! We're invincible! Now you know! Hercules, hospital time! I can't see the way! I'll take you! More More Tea! You fight often? No! Only to help the weak! Usually, we only bluffed. For you, we did it. Thanks! You mean it? No! Your bandaging hasn't improved. Shut up! You're very brave. But please be gentle. Only if you sell the beach. Listen! The sound of waves is beautiful. Your family may be rich, your wealth... won't grow on renting buoys. Swimming time! There must be an angle. Hercules Cafe Are you only wearing this? No underpants? Don't be ridiculous. You're More's buddy. You know how to get to him. I don't want him to sell the beach. I won't help you. Hercules dear! Sure you don't mean that. Sweetness won't work on me. Only on More! I'm not like him. I won't help you. Period! I can't force you. I'm going, bye! Thanks! Daisy! What does a sweet woman do? You're a woman, ask yourself. "Sweet" is not in my dictionary. The basics, like cooking, massage, fanning. All work well! Am I sweet? Like being a maid? Like it? Am I sweet? Put on a sexy voice! Why are you asking? It's about the beach. Will you sell? Well! If Mr. Hick likes sweet women. I can adjust. You sound horny. Didn't you just break up with George? Our love had long faded. He just brought it up first. I wonder who the third person is. You said you'd find out. I'm working on it. I have to run. Bye! Come on... Lunch is ready? You smelled it? Are you hungry? You sound strange. Don't you find me sweet? Someone tipped you. I give in to sweet women? I can also massage, is this good? Let's talk seriously. Sorry, I can't take this. Don't throw... Please be yourself, but... Forget the beach. You wasted all my energy. Go to hell! Sorry! You're here. I'm staying here, then. Okay, kiddo? Your friend? Auntie, I'm Yau! I'm a tourist from England. You called me auntie, but him kiddo. But he's older. My boyfriend-to-be can't be old. No way! Pardon me! Wait a minute! I don't know you. I said I'm Yau! But this inn is closed. Please, bro.! I'm alone, and came so far. I beg you, let me stay. Begging won't work. I tried! I can cook for you. Not bad! I made that! And I do massages. That's my line! Okay! You're so sweet! I'll make an exception. There's a room upstairs. That's not fair. Her efforts are sweet! But mine choke! She's so natural. Fine, let her stay. Beats hearing your voice all day. Your cooking looks great, okay? Where did that beauty go? I'm Hercules. Small but strong. You look silly! Cheers!

You came and saved me. You have been my idol ever since. What about this drawing? Tell us! I drew this map from memory. Our boat sank here. You want to visit... your Daddy's and Mommy's boat! He agrees to anything when women cry? How did you find out? Strange! Thanks! Daisy! I may leave here soon. I came up with a plan. You look nice! It's our date! Handsome; let's go! Let's go! Thanks!

Wait for me. Here, Rm 500. Your acting was awful. Sorry! I'm a graduate of the Modeling School! My card; call me! You're so wooden. Get going! Call me! Get a better guy next time. Did he buy it? Hook, line and sinker! I'll go back and cry. Then make him sign the deal. You're such a mastermind. Thank you for coming over. And such nice acting. I'll go now. Did I look like I was acting? George, you're here! I told Daisy to help you. Now we're even. You're the woman? How could you? You made me lose my job. Seduced my best friend. We've been together... for 2 years. You're conceited and arrogant. Never cared... about us. You're friendless! Daisy! You didn't know how to be sweet. You had to ask me. We came to tell you one thing. He never loved you. He loves me. You're just the last to know. You haven't eaten; have some noodles. Come on!! Speak out if you're sad. Cry if you're hurt. They're not worth it. Am I that bad? I've known Daisy for so long. If I'm conceited and arrogant. And friendless. Why did she put up with me? She's wrong! You're brave, strong and independent. Just a bit over-confident. You're special! My ex-boyfriend! And my best friend! Telling me off together! I lost all self-respect! They cheated on me. Who can I trust? You can trust me! I haven't worked hard... at impressing you. But I've done little things.

W w' e m,“ “k , av,? Read this! I have to go! Summer! I'm an architect. I live in New York. I spend my summer vacations here. There's an interview here. Please read it! So you pulled... One more lie on me. I didn't mean to. I thought it wasn't important. We'll sell the beach if you want. If not, I can still help you. How much do you need? Save it! I don't want your help! You controlled the whole show. You promised not to be like my friends. And now? They didn't hurt me most. You did! No more teasing please! I didn't mean it! But you did it. Summer! Mr. More, I beg you! You swept my self-respect away. Please stop this besetment. Let me go with some dignity. Okay? You all right? You're comforting me? I thought you would cry; you didn't. Poor thing! Thank you! I meant that woman. I was in the restaurant that day. I watched you leave with her. Then she came back alone. And met her friends' betrayal. The real George showed up. Teamed up with her best friend. Told her they were together. And ridiculed her relentlessly. She was heartbroken. Then you hurt her. Isn't she pitiful? She'd never forgive you. Why didn't you tell me? If I did, you'd have gone after her. Now you can't get her back. Pity is one thing. Watching you break up. Is fun! And revenge on my put! You're wrong. I can still get her back. Anyhow, thanks. Hong Kong International Airport. "Let me sing you a song." "Sing out my heart for you." "Perhaps I'll never see you again." "That's not what I want."
