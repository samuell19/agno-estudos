A Toho Production Godzilla Daikoku Island, southern tip of the Izu Island Chain Three months after the Daikoku eruption Hey. You all right? Yes, I'm fine. It's no good, Captain. The helm won't budge. Something's strange about this tide. What? Don't be dumb. These waves aren't enough to... We're being pulled toward the island! This is the Yahata Maru No. 5. I repeat, the Yahata Maru No. 5. Our ship... Our ship is in danger of wrecking! We are currently due west of Daikoku Island. Concrete no mori wa The concrete forest Shizumu yuuhi o kakushi Hides the setting sun Kodomotachi dake ni nemuri no epilogue An epilogue to the sleep only of children And now the news. Turbulent waves from a low-pressure system last night caused several vessels to run aground, Hey! And an investigation by the Japan Coast Guard revealed that the number is expected to increase. Is anyone on board? And an investigation by the Japan Coast Guard revealed that the number is expected to increase. And an investigation by the Japan Coast Guard revealed that the number is expected to increase. One of the boats believed to have wrecked is the Yahata Maru No. 5, a 77-ton fishing ship Yahata Muru No. 5 based out of Misaki Harbor. It was traveling in the waters near Daikoku Island in the southern tip of the Izu Island Chain when it suddenly disappeared, and continues to remain missing. He's alive. He's alive! Student ID Dept. of Science Electrical Engineering Division Hiroshi Okumura It was... a monster. The island suddenly rose up... like some giant rock. It was alive. Hold on a minute. Was it a monster like that sea louse just now? Something completely different. Huh? It breathed out some bluish-white ray. With a giant roar... Did you get a good look at it? It was too big. I couldn't see all of it from the bridge. We're a rescue squad from the Japan Coast Guard. They're here. We're a rescue squad from the Japan Coast Guard. They're here. Repeat, a rescue squad from the Japan Coast Guard. Hey! We will now initiate rescue procedures. Hey! Hey! Please do as you are instructed by our crew. Please do as you are instructed by our crew. Oshima, Izu Times Tohto Now listen here: The sole surviving crewmember said he saw some kind of giant creature. And there's a monster sea louse on that ship, as well as nine mummified bodies. That's more than enough proof! Come on! This is a major scoop, I'm telling you! Okay? Please have more faith. Okay, fine. I'll be there with the negatives soon. Okay. I swear... They won't believe me. I wouldn't believe in some "giant creature" either. To tell the truth, neither would I. Okay, look after things while I'm gone. Kanto No. 2 Police Hospital Professor Hayashida! Okumura-kun. You say you saw some monster? Yes, I did. Sir... since being rescued, I've told the coast guard, the police, and the people here over and over again. Is it that hard to believe what I say? It's only natural they don't believe you. That's what I think. All my friends are dead... and look what happened to me! This "monster" that he saw is Godzilla. Godzilla? I know Okumura-kun well. He's a trustworthy man. Head of the Cabinet Research Office Noboru Watanabe I didn't want to believe it was true, but... Still, why were the bodies of those aboard in that state? A giant sea louse drained their bodies of all blood and moisture. As for why an insect that should only be a few centimeters was that big... it's because it fed on Godzilla. It probably reached that size by being continually bathed in the radiation that Godzilla emits from within. Why do you think Godzilla suddenly appeared? I believe the cause is the volcanic eruption on Daikoku Island three months ago. Violent tectonic activity caused the sleeping Godzilla to awaken, driving it to the surface. Official Residence of the Prime Minister Godzilla, huh? Cabinet Prime Minister Seiki Mitamura I was hoping to finish out my term without incident. But, Mr. Prime Minister, Chief Cabinet Secretary Hirotaka Takegami that's not to say it will immediately attack Japan. This is true, but... Takegami-kun. Sir? Sure enough, let's keep this under wraps for now. Tohto Times They say it's pretty popular now. Tohto Times Thanks as always! Sir. Thank you. Appreciate it. Huh? What gives, Maki-chan? This is unexpected. Maki-ch... Huh? Okay, Mr. Editor. Why was this story dropped? I want to hear a reason. Something's come up. Let's go see the Editor-in-Chief. Editor-in-Chief's Office We've already been given a gag order by the coast guard, the police, and other agencies involved. The Yahata Maru No. 5, the ship with Okumura-kun and nine other people aboard, is officially still missing. What does that mean? That even the government has acknowledged there was some giant creature. Isn't that all the more reason to publish this? This "giant creature" was Godzilla. Godzilla? Sure enough... Incidentally, Maki-kun, if news of this got out, it would plunge the whole country into uncontrollable panic. It would shake people to the core. Stocks would plunge, and there could even be a political uprising. For better or worse, this scoop has to stay with you. I get it. So we've just rolled onto our backs like dogs, huh? We may be reporters, but this is something we can't print. Chief Cabinet Secretary Takegami has given us permission to reach out to Makoto Hayashida, a professor of bioscience. Hayashida? Excuse me. Are you Professor Hayashida? Who are you? I'm Maki from the Tohto Times. You, huh? They told me about you. What are you researching? Genetic recombination of the common vinegar fly. Flies... Genetic combination... What does that have to do with Godzilla? I understand you lost your parents in Godzilla's attack thirty years ago. So then, your initial motive in studying Godzilla was out of hatred or revenge? At first. But not now. Professor, is Godzilla an animal? A beast created through radiation? A monster? That seems to be the general consensus. It was man that created that "monster." Mankind is far more monstrous. Godzilla could be said to be a nuclear weapon. Nuclear weapon? What's more, a living nuclear weapon. It does as it pleases and continually destroys. What's more, Godzilla is immortal. So then, we just give up? I didn't say that. Godzilla is an animal. That much is certain. Excuse me. Is there something about her? Um, yes. What is she to Okumura-kun? His younger sister. His sister? So then, she and Okumura-kun have...? No, she hasn't seen him. She hasn't even been told he's been rescued. Government's orders. By the way, Professor, you've seen Okumura-kun, haven't you? Is he still in the hospital? Ah, thank you for earlier. How do you happen to know Professor Hayashida? I take his seminars at college. That's how I got this job, working part time and organizing his data. I understand you're Okumura-kun's sister. Yes. Are you a friend of his? That's right. Sorry, but what's your name? Naoko. Naoko-san, you must be worried about your brother. Do you have family? My brother and I, just the two of us. Every year, he works a few months on a fishing boat, knowing it will set him back in school. He does it to pay for my tuition and part of my living expenses. All the more reason to hate how the government handles things, not letting his sole flesh and blood know that he's alive. My brother is alive? He's being hidden away somewhere. Hidden...? Why? Because he witnessed Godzilla. The government fears a panic, so they're keeping your brother confined. They've imposed a media blackout. They're ignoring a sibling's love in the name of protecting "state secrets," and that's wrong. That's why I, on the other hand, choose to talk. Maki-san! He's at No. 2 Police Hospital. Thank you. Please! Let me see him! No visitors allowed. I don't care! Hey, wait! Please! Wait there! Let go! You can't! Let go! Let go of me! Wait right there! Naoko! Wait! Brother! I'm sorry for making you worry. Thank goodness. Naoko. Hey! I missed it. This is a scoop! Just one more shot! It's a moving scene, right? Please smile! Stop it! It's a moving scene, right? Please smile! That hurts! Let go! We have permission from the chief of police. See? Jeez, come on! All right, that's good. Okay. Got it. We won't put this in an article. Not now, at least. Soviet Nuclear-Powered Ballistic Missile Submarine Depth: 300 meters. Distance: 3 nautical miles Course: 12 degrees. It's coming at increased speed! It's nearly to our depth and approaching from the starboard bow! This is an attack! Run an acoustic signature analysis, now! It's not one of ours, but not an enemy! There's no screw propeller noise. What is this? I don't understand! Distance: 2.5 nautical miles. Speed: 40 knots. The enemy is emitting active sonar! I don't get it. Is it a whale? Whales don't have active sonar. Then it must be an American nuclear attack submarine, a Los Angeles-class. Distance: 2 nautical miles. Course: 12 degrees. At this rate, we're going to collide! Prepare torpedoes for launch! Fire torpedo No. 1! Fire torpedo No. 2! Emergency dive! Take us down to 400 meters! Torpedo 1 was a direct hit! Torpedo 2 was a direct hit! The enemy isn't returning torpedo fire. If this enemy wants to sink our sub, he should be prepared for all-out nuclear conflict. Captain! The enemy is coming in closer! Distance: 100 meters. It's right above us! Keep diving! Depth The enemy... it's still above us. We've got a leak on the starboard side! Both propellers, full speed ahead! Full speed ahead! Foreign Minister Seiichi Emori The Soviet Foreign Embassy has announced that one of its nuclear subs was sunk in the Pacific Ocean, south of Hachijo Island and fifty kilometers north of Aogashima. They're asserting it was an attack by an American nuclear vessel. The Americans? Have they admitted to the attack? The State Department is denying it. We received an emergency message from the Japanese Embassy in Moscow saying that the Soviets have moved to Level 1 combat readiness against America and the NATO Armed Forces. According to Eastern European news sources, the entire Soviet military has already been ordered Takero Morimoto to a state of alertness alongside the Warsaw Pact armies, so that it can move to combat status at any time. Meanwhile, both the American military and the NATO Armed Forces have responded by moving to a clear state of high alert, with the situation becoming increasingly strained. This is... Those were taken by a P-3C anti-submarine patrol aircraft five minutes after the Soviets emitted an emergency signal and their nuclear sub went down. I couldn't believe it at first either. Mr. Chief Cabinet Secretary. Call the U.S. and Soviet ambassadors at once. Sir. Also... we're going to release everything we know about Godzilla. U.S.-Soviet relations were extremely tense for a while, but the results of our investigation show that America had no involvement at all with the sinking of the Soviet nuclear submarine. Thus, we've managed to avoid conflict between U.S. and Soviet armed forces. The Soviet nuclear sub was sunk after having been attacked by Godzilla. This fact was learned via a Japanese P-3C anti-submarine patrol aircraft... and confirmed through photos revealing beneath the ocean's surface. Hey, what the heck?! Godzilla is indeed still alive. This was also confirmed through the testimony of Hiroshi Okumura, who miraculously survived despite being aboard the fishing boat Yahata Maru No. 5, with which we unfortunately lost contact on the nineteenth of this month in the waters around Daikoku Island. As a survivor... the one thing I can do for my crewmates is... to continue to vent my rage and hatred toward Godzilla. There's no way I can forgive that creature for what it's done. It's unforgivable! Hey! Where are you going? Godzilla Lives! Godzilla Sinks Nuclear Submarine! Will Godzilla Attack Japan? Godzilla Has Returned! A Miraculous Return, A Tearful Reunion! I Always Believed my Brother was Alive! He Alone Escaped Godzilla Professor. Where's Naoko-san? Dammit! Godzilla's making everyone crazy! You're a splendid reporter, but... I... I misunderstood you. Godzilla Emergency Countermeasures HQ The Army, Navy, and Air Force will work together to come up with a plan for attacking Godzilla. This concludes the explanation. Mr. Chairman. Does the JSDF currently have enough firepower to beat that creature? We'll beat it, without a doubt. Still, is there a weapon that can stand up to Godzilla's heat ray? There is. It's called the Super X. "Super X"? It was developed in secret, for national defense. The exterior is a titanium alloy. Its integrated circuitry makes extensive use of rare platinum. It was designed to withstand extremely high temperatures. What's more, as part of our Godzilla countermeasures, we're rushing to equip it with cadmium cannons. Cadmium can control nuclear reactions within atomic reactors. We're certain it will be effective against Godzilla. Simply put, it's a flying fortress. This giant outline is Godzilla. It's probably eighty meters tall. Will it come to Japan? Well, that's the problem. Godzilla's eating habits make it seek out radioactive material as an energy source. Clearly, that's why it attacked the nuclear sub. This is the island where you spotted Godzilla... And this is where the sub was attacked. That's pretty far from the mainland, huh? But it will come. It will come for sure... because this is where its food is. In a collective effort, In a collective effort, the entire country prepares itself against Godzilla Godzilla... Go-Godzilla! Shizuoka Prefecture - Ihama Nuclear Power Plant It's Godzilla! Hurry! Ground Self-Defense Force Mr. Prime Minister. I'm very sorry, but dense fog prevented us from discovering Godzilla sooner. Keep filming. Okay! That's the heart of the nuclear reactor. Radioactivity Indicator Godzilla has absorbed it all. That monster! Godzilla Breaks through Defense Net, Attacks Ihama Nuclear Plant! Dark Terror within the Dense Fog!! Nuclear Facility Destroyed Godzilla Absorbs Radiation and Returns to the Sea Fears Mount of a Return to Japanese Soil Ah, thanks. Maki-kun. Okumura-kun. I've theorized that the ancient dinosaurs had a homing instinct... and now we finally have proof. So, Godzilla has that same instinct? This area is magnetic. Put simply, it's like a radar that responds to the Earth's axis. It's the same as with migratory birds. The birds! I'm sorry. It's just... I've been thinking about why Godzilla suddenly went back to the ocean after that incident at the nuclear plant. He drank up all that radiation till he'd had his fill, right? Sir. Migratory birds... It was right when that flock of birds got loud and headed for the ocean that Godzilla acted as if he was following them. That's how it seemed to me. I'm sure you're right. Godzilla was chasing after that flock. Godzilla's "magnetic area" reacted to those birds. All right... We might be able to use this somehow. Okumura-kun. Sir! I have an old friend, a geologist named Minami. Please meet with him and go to Mount Mihara. Sir. Mount Mihara, Oshima Hello, Hayashida Bioscience Institute. Oh, Okumura-kun? It's Maki. Yeah, okay. Sir! It's Okumura-kun. Thanks for all your work so far. So, what did Minami say? Really? Is that possible? In much the same way, it takes little force to cause an eruption. In theory, the principle is the same as with this liquid. Put simply, it is entirely possible to induce Mount Mihara to erupt. The problem is how to lure Godzilla to Mount Mihara. As has been made clear in the documents you've been handed, we're certain we can come up with an answer soon. I just don't get it... You're saying you'll use Godzilla's "homing instinct" and some "magnetic area" and come up with a synthetic soundwave that will lure it in? What's more, even if it were possible to make Mount Mihara erupt, what about the problem of what happens to the people of Oshima? There have been no incidents of magma crossing the volcano's mouth and extending to its base. I'm starting to think it'd be best to leave getting rid of Godzilla to the Self-Defense Forces, don't you? Let's ask the JSDF for help, but also move forward with Hayashida-san's plan. As for securing the people's safety, we will ask the local, related agencies for their utmost support. That's all, gentlemen. Still, using a volcanic eruption to bury Godzilla for good... I never would've thought of it. There's no way we can "bury" it. So, what do you plan to do with it? Didn't you sense it at the nuclear plant? When Godzilla was defeated at Oto Island thirty years ago, it became a monster of legend. We'll be leaving now. Excuse us. When the world becomes unbalanced, natural disasters occur, and even monsters appear. We've seen this the world over, in different mythologies. Godzilla is truly a sign of the end times for humanity. I would hope that, at the very least, we can send Godzilla back to where it came from. That's the extent of it. Tehski, Special Envoy for the USSR Rosenburg, Special Envoy for the USA Mr. Prime Minister... Our national security council has already made its decision. The only way we can be absolutely certain of destroying Godzilla is by using nuclear weapons. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet of the USSR is also resolved to using nuclear weapons to attack Godzilla. If Godzilla reappears in Japan, or in Japan's coastal waters, you must agree to let us use nuclear weapons! Sir, this is a direct request from Our President to the Prime Minister of Japan. Mr. Prime Minister, the only way to destroy Godzilla is through tactical nuclear weaponry. We ask for your nation's consent. He's right! Are we clear? The nuclear blast would be contained to a small area, and with the right inertial guidance, we could kill this monster. Are we in agreement? If Godzilla should attack Japan, its next target could be Vladivostok, where the Soviet Pacific Fleet is based. Your response please, Mr. Prime Minister! Mr. Secretary of Defense... to what degree are you considering these "nuclear measures" that the U.S. and the Soviets are suggesting? Well, they have ten kilograms combined between the two. I understand that's approximately half of what was used on Hiroshima. Mr. Director General, should Godzilla reach Tokyo, how extensive do you think the damage would be? It's impossible to estimate. As a scientist, what would you say if nuclear weapons were used? The area within three square kilometers would be obliterated. However, should the locals be successfully evacuated... Put simply, the use of nuclear weapons would result in fewer casualties. At this point, I don't think there's any other option. Prime Minister Okura, I'd ask that you not make this decision lightly. If we use nuclear weapons, what are your plans for those affected by radiation? What's more, do we have solid proof that nuclear weapons will even work against Godzilla? Should the capital be destroyed, Japan would fall into a state of semi-paralysis. It would seem you haven't grasped that fact, Minister. What I'm saying is, if we use nuclear weapons against Godzilla, would they really-? No one can know. Not until we try. If you don't mind, Sir. Please, go ahead. Nuclear weapons are the first to have proven useful in actual, small-scale conflict. Truth be told, the U.S. and the Soviets have missed multiple chances to use them in battle. Put simply- You're saying this is an experiment to them? Yes. I see. So that's why they've agreed to be a part of this? Mr. Prime Minister, should we refuse the U.S. and the Soviet's offer, Japan could find itself on its own, diplomatically... I thank you all for your input. Our country adheres to the Three Non-Nuclear Principles: the non-possession, non-production, and non-introduction of nuclear weaponry. It is my wish to preserve that policy in this situation as well. That shows the egotism of your country! WE are the ones who had one of our subs sunk by Godzilla. We have the right to seek vengeance. This is no time to be discussing principles! It is precisely because things have come to this that I am adamant regarding this. There is no such thing as "safe" nuclear weaponry. What's more, should we use them just once, it would destroy the balance of power that has made them a deterrent force. It would lead to the world's end. That is the nature of nuclear weapons. If you would call Japan's Three Non-Nuclear Principles "egotism," then so be it. However, is not the Soviets' and the Americans' desire to use nuclear weapons also egotism? Well, gentlemen? Then we're out of options. I will speak to both countries directly and serve as the final authority. Soviet Nuclear Space Weapon American Nuclear Space Weapon Mr. Prime Minister... How did you address the American and Soviet leaders? "Should Godzilla appear in your countries, either America or the Soviet Union, should it threaten the capitals of Washington or Moscow, would you have the courage to use nuclear weapons?" Both leaders saw my point. Colonel Kasirin, Soviet Political Operative Soviet Cargo Ship "Barashevo" Comrade Polkovnik, what are you doing? The higher-ups decided not to use a nuclear missile, so this is no longer needed. We've spotted Godzilla! It's travelling the ocean floor and headed toward Tokyo Bay! It is our belief that Godzilla will eventually... ...reach Tokyo's shores. The JSDF plans an all-or-nothing attack against Godzilla, huh? There's talk of trying to get Godzilla to absorb a liquid cadmium solution. Would that even do anything? I don't consider Godzilla a nuclear reactor. I have no interest in that line of thought. Pull up the new data. Sir. We're out of time. I have to hurry and figure out this pattern, no matter what. Ground Self-Defense Force This is Squadron 2. The mission is a go. How are things looking? Squadron 1 is a go. Nothing out of the norm so far. This is mobile command. Repeat, mobile command. Anti-sub choppers still have nothing on sonar, over. Mobile command to HQ. Repeat, mobile command to HQ. Godzilla still shows no sign of having entered Tokyo Bay. Colonel, we have to leave now! It's dangerous! You all go first! I have to transport the control device for the nuclear missiles. I have to hurry and stop it! Let me find the strength! Mr. Chief of Staff, what about the Super X?! Sir. It's currently being loaded with cadmium artillery. It will be airborne soon. Government Orders Emergency Evacuations of Shinjuku, Minato, and Shibuya Areas The areas along the way, being Nagata, Akasaka, and Aoyama, have been placed on strict protective guard. Godzilla is now headed toward the Shibuya and Shinjuku areas. Any nearby residents, please evacuate immediately! Sir, is it still not done yet? Ah, perfect timing. Grab that data there for me. Okay. Godzilla is directly above us! We have received word from the Godzilla Emergency Countermeasures group. Having reached land, Godzilla is currently in the Nagata area and headed toward Shinjuku. Residents, please evacuate per the instructions of your local authorities. This is Shinjuku mobile command unit calling HQ, over. This is HQ, over. We will now attempt to lure Godzilla per mission parameters, over. Mobile command, please transmit the location of your vehicles, over. Unit No. 1 is in front of the Sumitomo building. Unit No. 2 is to the rear of Chuo Park. Unit 1, roger. Unit 2, roger! Ground Self-Defense Force Well, I guess this'll do. So, no one's around, huh? Is this "I love Tokyo"? Or "Welcome, Godzilla"? Well, let's see... What's this like? The heck am I doing? This ain't some singles' party like back in my college days. If I'm gonna drink, nothing but Camus cognac will do. Don't go walkin' around like you own the place, you bastard! You out-of-towner! You think just 'cause you're walkin' around Shinjuku that you've made it to the big leagues, huh? Adjust it down minus one. All right. Yes. We've done it! Sir! A JSDF helicopter should be landing on the rooftop soon. Okay. Let's hurry. You okay? Yes. Naoko-san! You all right? Yes. It's no good. The elevator's not working. What? Let's take the stairs. Okay. Come on. Let's go. No Entry Hello? That tremor just now triggered the automatic locks. Dammit! Fine! Where's the Super X?! It's just launched. Municipal Air Defense Fighter - Super X Good. I'll help. Cadmium rounds are ready to fire. Roger that. Launch the flare. Launching! Fire a cadmium round! Firing! Fire! Launch another flare. Fire! Time Remaining Time Remaining Sec. Min. Hello, Foreign Minister Emori? This is bad! Sir! We just got an emergency call from Ambassador Zasimov! An unexpected incident caused one of their satellites to launch a nuclear warhead at Godzilla! At this rate, it will strike Godzilla in about thirty minutes. In other words, a nuclear explosion in the heart of Shinjuku! Thirty minutes... How did this happen? The warhead's control mechanism was aboard a Soviet cargo ship in Tokyo Bay. When Godzilla destroyed the vessel, it apparently went off automatically. They had something like that on board? So, the Soviets can't control it? They can't detonate it in space? They said that unless the trajectories are precisely aligned, their missiles can't strike it. That's not enough time! There's no way we can evacuate the entire Shinjuku area in thirty minutes! What are you talking about? We'll use the subways and underground complexes. Move as many people as you can! Sir! Mr. Foreign Minister. Sir? Ask the Americans to shoot down that warhead, right now. Understood. Mr. Prime Minister! I was able to plot the trajectory of the Soviet missile. This is the orbit of the Soviet nuclear attack satellite. The warhead was launched almost 200 kilometers above the Gulf of Mexico. Next, the warhead will make a half-orbit along its trajectory and enter the stratosphere, making a direct hit on the Japanese mainland, targeting the Shinjuku region where Godzilla is located. We did it. Yes sir, we did! You've all done well. Thank you. Please stay back! Stay back! It's dangerous! Please stay back! Please don't come near. It's dangerous. You're in danger! Please stay back! Stay back! Sir! Godzilla is...! It's not dead. It couldn't be. Now would be the perfect time to go to Mount Mihara... This is an emergency broadcast. According to an announcement by the Godzilla Emergency Countermeasures Headquarters, a Soviet satellite has accidentally launched a nuclear warhead that is expected to detonate in the airspace above Shinjuku. Sir. accidentally launched a nuclear warhead that is expected to detonate in the airspace above Shinjuku. accidentally launched a nuclear warhead that is expected to detonate in the airspace above Shinjuku. All residents, please follow the instructions of your local authorities and evacuate as directed. Time is of the essence! Please evacuate at once. Take shelter on the underground platform of the Marunouchi or the Shinjuku Lines, as well as the tracks themselves. I repeat: All residents... America has pledged to launch an intercept missile. Kadena Air Base, U.S. Air Force The intercept missile has just been launched! Six minutes until it reaches the nuclear warhead. It's expected to strike in the stratosphere, approximately seventy kilometers above Tokyo. You all right?! Yes. I'm fine. Dammit. There they are. Over there! It's Okumura! Brother! Brother! Brother! Okay! Brother! Naoko. Okumura-kun, is that nuclear warhead really going to detonate? The Americans launched an intercept missile to blow it up in the air. Don't worry. I'm sure they'll destroy it. The turbulence is really bad. Hurry! Go on, Naoko-kun. No sir, you first. Sir! Hurry, here. Sir! Sir! Sir! Are you alright? I'm fine. Naoko-san. You go, Brother. Give this to the professor. Okumura-kun, there's no time! Go! Maki-san, look after my sister. Brother! Okumura-kun! You okay?! We can't keep the chopper in position with this turbulence. It's too dangerous! Mr. Prime Minister. The evacuations are going well. Two minutes and counting. A missile has been launched to detonate the nuclear warhead in the stratosphere. However, there is still danger of a nuclear explosion occurring. Please continue with the evacuation. Professor Hayashida said we'd be alright, but... a nuclear warhead is flying right toward us. And I'm sure Godzilla will awaken soon. Who knows if the helicopter can even make it to Oshima? I bet we're going to die here. The warhead won't go off, and I'm sure the helicopter will make it. What's going on? This isn't like you! I'm scared. I won't let you die. Direct hit! Mr. Prime Minister! That outage just now was from the nuclear explosion going through space and the stratosphere, creating an electromagnetic shockwave. And THAT is the result. The rotors have stopped! Commander! The injector nozzles aren't working! Just keep us stable! Sir! Can we launch? Sir! Good. Commander! We're out of cadmium rounds. All we have is conventional weaponry. So be it! We take off at once. Take off! Hey! HEY! Excuse me! Could you please hold the end of this hose? Yeah, sure. Here we come! Go on. No! Do it! Hurry! And don't look down. You okay? Hold position! Hold position! You bastard! You just pretended to be dead, huh? Run! You okay? You all right? Don't think of this as a disaster. Think of it as a chance! This one's nice and light. Ow... Hey, big fella! You got any brains in your head? You dumb bastard! Dumb bastard... Ow. Ow... Get down! Professor. Do you think it's working? It's headed for Mount Mihara, isn't it? The professor did it! I have to go, too. Let's go together. Connections have been restored! Godzilla is heading toward Oshima. Mount Mihara - Base at the Crater's Outer Rim Professor. Godzilla is headed this way.
