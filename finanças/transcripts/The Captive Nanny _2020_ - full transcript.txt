I don't know how much time I have, but... I don't, I don't think I'm... I don't think I'm gonna survive. I think this is it. I'm so sorry. They, they're keeping me in here and they're getting more violent every time. I think they're gonna kill me. I'm so sorry. Hold on. No! No! No! Please, I can... I know I can help you. Please let me go. No, don't do this. No! No! Oh, my God! You've taken more than the required pre-adoption courses. Pre-interviews are complete. So, it's come to this. The dreaded home study. So, adoption. Why? I'm unable to have children of my own, medical complications. And beyond that, I grew up in foster care. So I know how many unwanted children there are out there. It just seems fated that this is what would work for us. And work life? What's that like? I've been working with children, nannying for 15 years. - Yeah, she's great. - And you? I just got promoted to manager at a music venue downtown. The Supercell. It's his dream job. Great benefits. I'm curious how with a beyond full-time day job for you, Chloe, and I imagine a full-time night job for Rob, how do you plan to raise a child together? Well, I plan on shifting away from nannying. I mean, with Rob's promotion, he can support us until I find my next thing. And, obviously, I'd be home with the baby. Did you ever live with your birth parents? Until I was eight years old. They were arrested and died in prison a few years ago. Look, I know my background doesn't look that great on paper. But losing my family, that source of unconditional love, I... I just know I'll be the most loving, dedicated mother to our future child. That connection, it's all I've ever wanted. I'm not sure that's a fair burden to place on a child, that your love depends on theirs'. Well, if they say no, we'll just... call the next agency and... and the next. I... What? Maybe it's not the right time. But they could say yes. Maybe they shouldn't say yes. What are you talking about? - I'm spread thin. I'm beat. - I know. I've... I've worked so hard to get you onboard with this. Look, I... I know you're probably feeling pretty hurt. - After whatever that was. - No, don't make this my problem. - I know what I want. - Do you? Do you know what you want? I mean... What was all that about never having love? What, I don't love you? What am I to you? I... Am I not enough for you? You're everything to me. That's why I want to have a family with you. And if I don't? Am I still everything to you if I don't want that anymore? Oh, honey. He doesn't deserve you. God, God, we loved that van and those shirts. I thought they were so professional. What... What did we use? Nail polish? - Everyone thought it was blood. - I still have mine. - No, you don't. - I do, yes. - Ooh! - What is it? Ah. Here, feel. Oh! You're busy in there. Are you a boy-band fanatic, too? Ooh, I do not have long before this thing rears its head. - Mm. - Oh. Where can you go? How can I help? I mean, I'd have to work another five years before I could do it alone. I relied too much on Rob, too much on his income. No, all I'm hearing is logistics. We can handle logistics. It's like in that photo. We had no money, no car. Cell phones were not a thing. We basically had to sneak out and get 50 miles away from home, still look good when we got there and then find someone to get us into that show for free. That's why I keep that picture around. I want this baby to see what's possible when nothing can stop you. Even for one night. I love you. I am not gonna leave you ever. I love you, too. All right, sleep tight. - You, too. - I'll try. Okay, here I go. - Do you need help? - No, no, I got it. - Are you sure? - Oh, yeah. Hi, Emily. It's great to hear from you. When will it be a good time to meet? - Hi. You must be Chloe. - Hi. - I am. - Welcome. I'm Emily. Come on in. - Nice to meet you. Thank you. - Of course. Did you have any trouble finding the place? - No, not at all. - Oh, good. Michael! Chloe's here. Oh. - Hi. I'm Michael. - Hey. Chloe. - Nice to meet you. - Do you like tea? - I would love some. - Great. - Can I take your jacket? - I'll put some water on. - Yeah, thank you. - Just... Yup. - Ow. There it is. - I'm stuck. All right. So, you've been doing this for a while? Mm, my whole life. Even when I was a kid I was raising kids. - Have you ever lived-in before? - No. But I'm in between places, so it's perfect. Um, what about you? Ever had a live-in? You would actually be our first nanny. Oh. Well, may I ask why now? My business is taking off. I own a fashion boutique. And I'm around a lot less than I would like to be. As Tommy gets older, it takes more and more time, especially with the homeschooling. Really, this is just a formality. You're clearly a pro. For us it comes down to how open you are to the rules that we insist upon. Tommy is not to be taken out. And we ask that you let us know when you do leave the house. I know it sounds crazy, but we insist. A-at least until a level of trust has been established. Privacy is essential. Oh, and we will give you a phone. Um, the last thing that we want is to rack up a bunch of data with our crazy check-ins. But if you're okay with all of that, um, we would love for you to meet Tommy. Um, I just wanna be upfront with you. Oh, I've had some changes going on in my life. My boyfriend of ten years and I have broken up and I'm going through the adoption process and I'm just really hoping to continue that, if that's okay. Well, hopefully, we can cross that bridge together when it comes. It's really wonderful, isn't it? - The offer still stands. - Oh, I accept. - Can I hug you? - Yes. - Welcome home. - Thank you so much. It seems so perfect. - I'll just sneak in a hug. - Oh, yeah. - Thank you. - Oh, good. Tommy! Bud. Tommy? - Yo, Tommy. - He's a bit of a hider. - Tom-Tom. - Hey, Tommy! Buddy. What's with all the keypads on the doors? Oh, they were there when we bought the house. Oh. Who lived here? The president? - Oh, what's up there? - Uh, the third floor. That's actually where your room is. We figured you'd want some privacy away from all of us. - Oh. Okay. - Tommy! Nope. So, are you up for a game of hide-and-seek? Oh, that's my specialty. Great. Um, you wanna take the basement? - Uh, same door? - Yeah. Sure. Hey, Tommy! Ready or not, here we come. Tommy. Hey, Tommy. Hm. A lot of stuff. - Hi. - Hi. You must be Tommy. That's a pretty good hiding spot. Mm-hmm. Your parents are looking you. Do you want to come out and I can take you upstairs and they know you're okay? Sure. I'll be out in one second. - How do you get out of there? - Well, I have secret tunnels. That's cool. - Don't tell them. - Tell them what? About my hiding spot, it's one of my better ones. - That is a good one. - And who are you? - Oh, I'm the new nanny. - Hi. It's nice to meet you. I'll keep your secret. - Please do. - I will. I think we're getting along great. - Oh. - This is it. Oh, this is cute. Wow, it's bigger than I expected. Well, that's good. Uh, well, I'll-I'll let you get settled in. D'you, do you want me to close the door? Uh, yeah, that would be great. Thank you. Okay. New home. Hey, guys. Oh! What? Bolted? "Thanks for keeping a secret. Tommy." Do not get attached. Bobby pins. Okay. Hm. It's a pretty color. Yes? I heard a lot of noise. Is everything okay? Yeah, I just, I noticed that this was bolted to the floor. Oh, yeah, left-over child-proofing from when Tommy was a kid. Oh, yeah. Are you getting settled in okay? Uh, yeah, I am. Oh, that is such a cute print. Prints never really worked on me. Steph. Oh! Stephanie! We were like 13. We used nail polish. Everyone thought it was blood. Well, I'll let you get finished. Just, um, give me a shout if you need anything. - I will. Thanks for everything. - Of course. Goodnight. Blank Slate. I gotta call her. Hm. - Someone, help! - Tommy. Tommy, it's okay. - I can't... - It's okay. I'm at the door. - No, no. I can't! - I'm at the door. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. He just gets night terrors. - It's okay, buddy, mom's here. - No. No. - Hm... - It's okay, buddy. It's okay. Oh, my sweet boy. It was just a bad dream. It was just a bad dream. You're okay. You're okay. You're okay. Oh. Climb back in bed, buddy. Climb back in bed. Oh, uh, that's my sweet boy. Okay. Hey, you're okay. Hey. Look. One, two, three... I'm sorry you had a bad dream, honey. Are you okay? Okay. Try to go back to sleep. My sweet, sweet, sweet boy. I love you. That song. - You know it? - Yeah, it's Blank Slate. - Baz Martin. - I'm surprised you know that. It's a deep cut. You must be a fan. Yeah, when I was 13 years old. I mean, you saw the shirt. Well, you never really stop being a fan though. Mom? I'll be right there, sweetie. Um, don't tell Michael about this. - About what? - The song. - It's kind of our little thing. - Okay. I'm coming, bud. Thanks. Ooh, boing. I'm gonna miss you today. - Please be nice. - I'm always nice. I know you are, my little B-boy. Oh, before I forget, that's the code for the front and the back and then that's the code for the side. - You need a code to get out? - Mm-hmm. All right, you two have fun. What are you doing today? Mm, hang out. - Ooh. - Oh, hey! Come on! - M-Michael. - Yeah, hm? Well, you don't mind, right? Chloe, please tell my husband that we can trust you. I totally get it. I mean, you've spent every day with Tommy. And here I am, a stranger, and you're supposed to trust me with him. I'd feel the same way if Tommy was my kid. That's why you can trust me. I've been doing this a long time. He's in good hands. Plus, you gave me this fancy phone and you can text us and video call us any time you want. It'll get easier. I promise. Yeah, dad. - Ah. Ooh! - Oh, come on! - Okay. Okay. All right. - All right, see you, kiddo. Bye, dad. Well, do you wanna finish your breakfast and then play another game of hide-and-go-seek? Why can't we just go play hide-and-seek? That's a funny hiding spot. What you lookin' at? Can we go? Go where? The playground. Your parents don't like it when you go out when they're not here. What if it can be our secret? I can't do that. Well, Sylvia used to let me. Who's Sylvia? Do you wanna play? Go. Are you the new nanny? What happened to the old one? Oh, they've never had a nanny before. So that's what they told you. Look, I've been around for a long time. I raised half this neighborhood. And all I'll say is, just be careful with them, okay? Especially Emily. My husband's a plumber. They hired him once. One of the few people they actually allowed in the house, so it must've been serious. After just a few days of work, Emily started berating him about being some sort of boy-band fanatic. Uh, my husband, beer gut and tattoo. She just decided he was something he isn't. Convinced herself. She even called the police on him, said that he was infiltrating her family, spying, or some nonsense. That's funny to you? I'm sorry. It just sounds a little ridiculous. That woman is crazy. Just be careful, okay? From one nanny to another. Hey, Josh. Come on, we gotta go. Where have you been? Tommy, go to your room. Now. What was rule number one? I'm sorry, it was just the playground. If Michael knew about this... - Maybe this is too much. - Wait, what's too much? - I like Chloe. - Tommy. Have a seat, please. Okay. Emily, I'm sorry. I... Oh, no, no, no. We haven't been totally transparent with you. It's not fair to expect you to follow the rules when you don't have all of the information, know all of the danger. Blank Slate. The band. Your shirt... I used to be in a relationship with Baz Martin. Baz Martin? The Baz Martin? I was a costume designer on a couple of shows. I met Baz and we were together for five intense years. I broke it off. I... I couldn't stay in that lifestyle. Baz took it hard. That's when he started stalking me. He would show up on dates that I was on. He found his way into every place I lived. I would wake up with him watching me. What? Oh, how was this not all over the news? No one wanted to accept Baz Martin as anything other than the man of their dreams. Even the cops. What? That's terrible. There was no other choice but to make our lives small. If Baz ever found out I have a kid... I can't... Uh, but... I mean, the song you sing with Tommy, it was a Baz song. I... I mean, why, why would you do that? I still get his songs stuck in my head all the time. I thought maybe I could change the context, make it into something good, I guess. Well, what does, what does Tommy know? We try to protect him. That's why we live the way we do. Oh, he-he mentioned a, a friend Sylvia who would take him out. Sylvia, yup. His imaginary friend. He makes up friends sometimes. I mean, I guess I would, too, if I was him. Yeah, makes sense. It is so hard... having someone be that obsessed with you. I wouldn't wish it on anybody. He couldn't get enough. Still can't. So, now that you're on the same page... are you still in? Of course. Thank you for telling me, trusting me. Hey, why don't you go check on him? Tell him that it's okay, this time. Hm. Thanks. Emily, one more thing. Um, would it be all right if I put you down as a reference? Uh, for the adoption. - Of course. - Thank you. Okay, I'm doing it right now. Oh, my gosh. This is insane. I can't believe it. I'm a single mom as long as Baz Martin doesn't kill me. - That is insane! - I know. I... They live their lives by it. It's the weirdest thing. I think they're lying about not having a nanny before, too. Why? I have no idea. I mean, you know they're watching you, right? Probably even have cameras in the bathroom. Oh, God, Stephanie, no! Are you sure about this? All that on your first day? If there's one thing I've learned from this job, it's that families are weird. And who am I to judge, you know? It'll be good. I'll make it good. Plus, this is the best thing that's happened to me in a while. Sorry. Sorry. What are you doing? You scared me. Something's happening. Oh, no. He's playing here, in town. Maybe you should get out of town for a week. Does Michael know? I can't tell Michael about this. Chloe, I need you to be honest with me. - Did you know about this? - How would I have... About what? The secret show. How would I have known about that? Because the article speculates that it's being held at The Supercell where your ex works. How do you know that? - You said it in your interview. - No, I didn't. Chloe, please don't change the subject. Did you know about this? I swear I didn't know. You realize how this looks, right? I promise, it's just by chance. Are you still close with your ex? No. I'm done with that. I need you to call him. Get whatever information you can. - Emily, I... - Chloe... You know how serious this is. Think about Tommy. This is a whole new level for Baz. Finding out where I live, making a big splash in the press, he's relentless. - How do you know that's... - What else could it be? Everything he does relates back to me. He's obsessed. I realize how hard that is to understand for someone who's never been loved like this. But look, if you're not willing to go the extra mile for Tommy, I'm gonna have to call the adoption agency and revise my reference. - Excuse me? - It's not a good look. That you would just put Tommy in danger like that. There's information out there to keep him safe and you have access to it. Okay. I'll do it. Thank you. Hm. Ready or not, here I come. Where are you? What? You're supposed to be hiding. You were just taking too long. - Whatever. Your turn. - Okay. One... two... three... four. Ready or not, here I come! Tommy? I got... you. Hm. Another bobby pin. It's got a lock. This family... Ready or not, here I come! Where are you? Hey! Now who's the one not hiding? There's someone in there. It's okay. There's no one down here. Okay. Quick, get upstairs. Let's go. It's okay. 9-1-1. What's your emergency? There's an intruder in the house. Yes, that's the address. Please send someone fast. Okay. Okay. - I think they're gone. - Shh. Okay, come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Hi. Whoa! What are... Oh, there was just someone in the basement. Can you please put that down? I didn't mean to scare you guys. That was me in the basement. That used to be my workshop before the boutique. I just keep it locked off to Tommy and Michael 'cause he can be such a mess sometimes. I just stopped by to pick up a few things. I didn't mean to scare you, but thank you for your concern. - We are okay, though, right? - I was so scared. - It's all right, honey. - How... We're fine. I appreciate you coming so quickly. - Thank you, officer. - Thank you. Have a good day. So, you heard anything about The Supercell? He hasn't texted me back yet. It wasn't a great breakup. I'm sure you'll find a way. Can I come over? Hm. Okay, this is... Ahem. I'm gonna head out to a friend's if that's okay. Oh, can, c-can we talk to you for a minute? In the future, please come to us first with any concerns. - What do you mean? - Well... Like today, with the police. They don't wanna help us, like I told you. And we don't really want them in our lives snooping around. I thought you wanted me on alert. No, we-we do, but we can take care of ourselves. Oh, okay, I'm, I'm sorry, it's just, if there was an-an emergency like a fire or Tommy got hurt, I mean, we can't even get out... We don't want anyone else here. Okay? It's a touchy situation. We apologize. But I think that we're all in agreement now? Yes. Where did you say you were going again? - A friend's. - Oh, Michael will drive you. That's okay. I'll drive myself. Oh, it'll be safer this way. Oh, let me get my coat. - Well, great. - Have fun. Thanks. Maybe she quit, and they didn't wanna seem bad to work for. - I mean, we know they're weird. - Yeah, but why lie about it? I mean, you could've just said that she left. You know, I looked everywhere, I couldn't find any nanny cams. - Who doesn't have a nanny cam? - Maybe they don't want evidence. - Of what? - Of you. Maybe they'd learned a lesson with her. Okay, well, I found these bobby pins everywhere. Maybe they're Emily's. What, you think Sylvia bent a bunch of bobby pins to pick a lock? All their locks are electronic. Okay, but maybe they changed them. Can you run DNA on this? I can't just walk into the lab without cause or case number. You really didn't find anything on the Browns? Nothing at all? Not even non-suspicious stuff? He bought that house 11 years ago. You said he. Yeah, Michael. Hm, that's weird. I guess I just always assumed it was Emily's money, you know, from her business. And Michael's kinda useless. I just don't get it. They talk about the police like they've dealt with them. I mean, enough to not trust them. Emily said that she changed their names. Maybe there's something under a different identity. A restraining order? Uh, uh, what about Baz? Is there one on Baz Martin? - Hold on. Wait. - Or vice-versa. There is this, Emily applied for a business license a few years back, it's tied to an address. - That is right near here. - Can we go? Yeah. All right, we're gonna go. I promise I'll be safe. Who's that? Oh, it's just Michael. He drove me. Oh. We're just gonna go for a walk. Okay. Why do you have to tell him that? Well... it's just they just like to know where I am. Okay. I think this is it. Yup. Are you sure? - That's what it says. - Really? Yeah. Ugh. Huh. What's the matter? - Damn. Damn. Don't look. - All right? Wait, is that Michael? - Did he follow us here? - It-it's fine. Do you want me to call Kevin? No, it's fine. It does not feel fine. Can we go? Yeah, let's get you home. It's just not what I expected, you know? Yeah. It's real, uh... bleak. It's creepy, Chlo. These people are creepy. It's okay. I'll be fine. - Oh. Welcome home. - Phew. Dinner's almost ready. Come on in. Yum, yum, that smells terrific. Hey, bud. Hey. Well... Where are you goin'? Hey. And you wonder why we can't have nice dinners. The casserole will be ready in a minute. Let's start with some salad. Hey. Tommy, what is that? Let me see that. Hey, give it... You two okay down there? Thank you. Yeah. Tommy found this. I don't even know what that is. Quiet. - I'll get it. - Don't move! Don't move. Please take Tommy to his room. Okay, come. Is everything okay... Just please go. - What did I do wrong? - I'm sure it's nothing. Just hang out here for a little bit, okay? - I don't want to. - You have to. Well, I'll come back. Don't worry. Okay. Can you explain this? No. We're gonna need you to stay in your room until we can figure out what's going on. Well, is there anything I can do? No. Okay, I'll just get my phone. Michael will bring it to you. Okay. Is this really necessary? Michael! Michael! It's from 2002. The year we met. Why would someone hold on to that? Because they're sick. Where did she go earlier? Some abandoned building. Did you see anything? Move her car off the street, cut the Wi-Fi. How do you know Baz, Chloe? - I don't know Baz. - How do you know him? I don't. This is going to be a lot easier if you're just honest with us. What will be easier? We know you've been digging around about us. Why? I'm sorry, okay? I shouldn't have. It doesn't mean anything, I swear. Why? Look, if you think I'm trying to hurt your family, I'll just go. I quit. Uh, just let me go. And just let you run back to Baz and tell him all about our lives, all about Tommy? I don't know Baz. - Search her things. - Mm-hmm. What? Is this a joke? - Okay, Emily, you knew about t... - Stop lying. Why are you doing this? We can talk about everything when you're ready to be honest. - What? - Grab her suitcase. Mm-hmm. No, you-you wanna talk about honesty? Do you know where she goes every day? We just can't have this. - You... - It's safer this way. You... You can't do this. Emily! Emily, you can't do this. Emily! Michael! You guys can't do this! Please, let me out! Emily! Can you hear me? How you doin', buddy? How you feelin'? I'm okay. What? "Mattress?" What's on your mind? Hm? Hey, remember how when Sylvia was here, how important it was to us as a family to keep her safe? That if people knew that she was here that it could hurt her, that it could hurt us? That's how it is with Chloe now. We don't wanna lose each other, right? - We wanna stick together. - I don't wanna lose you. You won't, you won't, you won't. But we need to be careful right now, and we need your help. You mean more to us than anything else in this whole world. And all of this, I know it may seem scary or feel bad sometimes, but no matter what, it's all for you because we love you and we're a family and we wanna stick together, right? I love you, too. So you understand that if you accidentally tell someone about Chloe being here or if you try to help her in some way... you will lose us, and we will not be a family anymore. Before I forget, Tommy likes string cheese. - So we have a chance. - Okay. What are you doing here? Just following me? I think you're recording me. Hide you back to where you belong. This is Sylvia Connor. I'm... I've been in this room for four weeks and I don't know, I don't know if anyone will ever see this, but I have to set the record straight in case something happens to me. - Oh. - I lied to them. I said that I know Baz Martin. God, it's like, it's like she wanted me to know him, but I... I lied in my interview to impress her because it seemed like... she wanted me to. And now every time I just have to give, I just have to give them... I have to give them information and make them believe that I know him and then, then they'll give me food and water. But it's, it's not true. I'm terrified that they're gonna find out I don't know anything. It's all her, in her head she thinks, she thinks that he still loves her and there's a chance for them to be together. There's no chance. She's completely delusional and she's made me... There's something in the vault in the basement that you have to... I think the code is 2-1-2-6. So just try to... Just try 2-1-2-6, 2-1-2-6. I know it's something... but I'm so sorry, I can't help you. - I wanted... - Huh? Please forgive me. Oh, God. No. No, no, please don't. No, no, no. Please I can do it. I know I can help you. Please let me help you... Can I help you? Chloe? Chloe, are you in there? There's, there's someone at the door. Tommy? Tommy? Tommy, is it Stephanie? I would like to see Chloe. - Is she here? - She's not. She's out and about with, uh, with Tommy. Tommy? Tommy? It's weird because I've been trying to call her, but it keeps going straight to voicemail. Stephanie! Mm-hmm, oh, yeah, she's, she's using our phone that we supply her while she's out and about. Okay, well, but I do get texts from her, just later on in the day, and they're random. A lot of texts. That's not like her. And none of them are about my baby that I just had, and that's definitely not like her. Stephanie, I'm in here! Stephanie! Can you hear me? Mm-hmm. I'm-I'm sorry, I, I don't know about... Okay, well, how about this? I know all about your wife. I know all about you, and you're not fooling me for a second. Ah! Stephanie! - Chloe. - Tommy. Tommy! Tommy! Tommy. Tommy. You have to be quiet. Tommy, is it Stephanie at the door? I think it's your friend, yeah. Tell her that I'm here, okay? I-I can't. I, I can't. Please. - I got to go. I got to go. - No, no, no, no, wait, wait. - I-I got to go. - No-no, hold on. Hold on. Don't. Take this now. What are you doing? I'm gonna give you a couple of days and then I'm gonna come back with my husband. He's a cop. I don't know if you knew that. What did we talk about? She's taking advantage of you. Do you want to spend more time in your room? No. Wait... I know Baz. Tommy, go downstairs to your room, right now. Here. I met him at a concert once. I told him I liked his songs. Wait. What do you know? I know... that you've been sent here by Baz to keep tabs on me and to get back into my life again. It's almost like he wanted me to find out. You don't wanna tell me about the show, do you? You're afraid of losing him to me. Oh. It's like withdrawal. I understand what it's like to be in Baz's light. It's the only thing you need, even after you've been choked off. I remember being on the road, every show... watching him from the catwalk, it was like my own little view. What does he want from me? He wants you to know that he still loves you. What does he know about Tommy? That he's a good kid and that you're an amazing mother. Did he send you here to take Tommy? No. I would never. Yes, you would. If he wanted you to, you would. What does he say about me? That you're the most... beautiful thing he's ever seen. And... that he's... sorry for not loving you better. He's sorry? It must be so hard for you to hear him say things like that about me. What hooked you to him? What's your favorite song? - Um... - Mine's Memory. Sing. - Does he want to see me? - Yeah. Why did he stay away for so long? You know him. He comes and goes. - Are you messing with me? - No. Oh, there's something so dark about your eyes. He must love that. That's what he said about mine, that was what he loved the most. Until he said it scared him. We're in a very dangerous situation, you and me. You understand that, right? That's why you need to be honest with me right now. The secret show is in two days. How do I get in? R-Rob is... - Does he know about Baz? - No. It's another thing you and I have in common. I need you to use that to get me in, to get me backstage. This could be my only chance. I think it would be a very good idea to make yourself useful right now. It's just a suggestion. Here we are. I'm not hungry. Okay, that's fine. - Here, let me help. - No, I got it. I got it. Stand right there. Don't, don't move. Michael, what are you doing? Be quiet. You don't have to do this. You don't have to listen to Emily. Shh! Michael... it's not you. You don't have to do this. Michael, I know it's not you. He didn't lock the door yet. Well... Tommy? Let's go wait for mommy downstairs. Let's wait for her down there. We are in danger having her here, having her know what we did. We killed someone. And she knows about it. Window. Okay. 2-1-2-6. 2-1-2-6. This is exactly what I was afraid of. We have to end this now. This is not worth it, Emily. Do you want to wait for this family to be terrorized again? Or for Tommy to get hurt, or for me to get hurt? Is that what it's gonna take for you to understand the situation we are in? Well, of course not. It just... And I, and I gotta say, it's like you're... It's like you're choosing him. Like you want it to be true. Oh, Michael. No, no, no. I just want our family to be safe. Okay? And we're gonna be done with her soon either way. Okay? We have to be cleaner about it this time, though, right? Right? Little bit less impulsive. Right? Right. How can we be sure? Let's go talk to her. Okay. Well, come on. Let's go, Chloe. 2-1-2-6. Okay. Come on, Chloe. Think. Think. Yes. Where is she? What did you do? We have to find her! Emily. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. She can't get out, not through a door. There's no windows open or broken. - She's gotta be here. - Tommy. The hell are you... - Hey. Guess what? - Huh? We're playing hide and seek. Chloe's already hiding. You wanna help find her? Yeah, I'll find her. Chloe? Tommy. Tommy. - Mom... - Please. Why are you crying? Tommy... you have to keep our secret, okay? Don't tell. - Tommy? - Uh-oh. Well? No. Not here. 2-1-2-6. Oh. Oh, my God. Oh. Uh-oh. Oh, my God. Don't you dare. Do not even think about making a sound. This can only end one of two ways. If you help me, no one has to get hurt. If you don't, it's gonna end very badly for you and Rob and Stephanie. And, yes, I know where they live. I know everything about you, Chloe. So if you help me, no one has to get hurt. I need you to be a very, very smart girl. You're smart, right, Chloe? Can I help you? Is Chloe here? She gave me this address. I'm sorry, she gave you this address? Yeah. Chloe? Yeah, Chloe. Wait right here. Let him in. Why don't you have a seat? - Come on in. - Okay. Can I take your jacket? I'm fine, thanks. Right this way. Honey, why don't we give them a second? - I'll meet you upstairs? - Sure. Sit. - Well, hey. - Hi. Hi. It's good to see you. - How are you? - I'm good. I'm just tired. - Just tired. - Yeah. Yeah. How-how's work? Are you sure you're okay? Uh-huh. Yeah. That's good. Yeah. I heard you got Baz Martin. - That's amazing. - It's exciting. He's insane about security, but... Hm. More than usual? Oh, vet all of our staff and all procedures. It was kind of a nightmare. I mean... It's probably a good thing, though. Why? Are you sure you're okay? Yeah. So it was more than usual? Apparently, he had a stalker several years ago. It's why he didn't get out much. Huh. It's crazy. Yeah. This is gonna sound weird. But could you get Emily in tomorrow? Like, backstage? I, uh... Even as the manager, I don't have that kind of pull on this gig. What about a staff credential? Um... What? What's... - What's going on? - We'll be together. It's just, Emily is a huge fan and when she found out that you work for The Supercell, she just, we thought that you could make it happen. And maybe it's just safer than being honest. I've been thinking about you all the time. I wanna work this out. I love you. Try my best. Thank you. You have no idea what this means. Well, come on. Are you so excited? It's almost over. You know, you should've made your bed. You did such a good job. See, nobody had to get hurt. We should go. We? Oh. Yeah. That was really clever last night. I give you credit. But no, honey, you're staying where you are. Emily... Baz gets to meet his son tonight. - Emily... - Mom? Baz and I tried for so long... It killed him. Really weighed on us. Oh, my God. Tommy's gonna bring this together. The perfect family. My little miracle. It's exactly what I've always dreamed of. He won't be able to resist. Emily... Emily, there has to be a part of you that knows this isn't real, that you made it up to have something to believe in. Please, you don't have to bring Tommy into this, you don't. Mom? I'm in Chloe's room. - Hey. - Hi. - Say bye to Chloe. - Bye, Chloe. Go give her a hug. Sweetheart, did you thank her for bringing your family back together? Thank you. Bye, Chloe. Look what I got! Hey, Rob. This is Tommy. He is Baz's biggest fan and he cannot wait to get an autograph. Hey, Tommy, I'm Rob. How you doin'? Hi. Uh, no one mentioned anything about a kid. Where's Chloe? Michael! Michael! Oh, she's just running a little bit behind. Okay, well, I think we should wait for her. For sure. Um, Tommy just has to use the bathroom. So if we can just pop inside for a sec... Okay, you gotta wear these at all times. Okay? And you can drop your coat off inside and wait right there, and when Chloe gets here, we can take you guys on a tour. But after that we gotta get you outta here, okay? Michael, Michael, she took Tommy. She took Tommy, she has a gun. She thinks Tommy is Baz's son. I know he's in danger. We have to go. I'm telling you the truth. Go to the vault room in the basement. 2-1-2-6. 2-1-2-6. Hi. How's it going? - Going good. How you doin'? - Good. Uh, Baz just requested some wardrobe changes. Al right. Baz! Wardrobe's here to see ya. All right, send them in. No! No! Oh, um, also, the guy at the front, I think his name is Rob, um, he said that he is having some trouble and he needs you to help him out. All right. Come on in. Come on in. Hey, Baz. Big boss wants to see me. You okay? - Uh, yeah. - Thank you. Very welcome. Oh. So can I get your opinion on something? Hi. You don't have to do this. How did you get in here? Tommy, buddy, come here. Baz, I have someone I want you to meet. This is your son. This is Tommy. What? Stop right there. Don't, don't come any closer. Come here. Tommy, come on, come here. You know how we all play hide and go seek, right? Mommy needs you to hide for her right now. I'm gonna come find you later, okay? But mommy and daddy need to have a conversation real quick, okay? He's gonna come... Just gonna take a second. I love you so much. Go, go hide, Tommy. - Go hide. Go hide. - Bye, mom. Hold, Chelsea, please. We tried to be a family for so long. Can you believe it came true? Please. Please put the gun down. Where's your tattoo? Why are you doing this? You wanted this. You sent her. You said that you were sorry and that you loved me. We have a son, Baz. I, I don't know, I don't know who that kid is. He's got nothing to do with me. Chelsea, please. Please just... Why can't you see this for what it is? The restraining orders, the fact that I won't go out in public anymore, the fact that... I fear for my life every day because of you. I design my life around avoiding you. You designed your life around me? - Rob! - What's going on? - You need to call the cops. - What? Emily. She has a gun. Are you gonna shoot me? I forgive you. I know. You were just scared. Did you not hear what I just said? You just were scared that you weren't enough. But, baby, you are, you are enough. We tried for so long, Baz. And we finally got it. Can you believe it? Just tell me that you love me. - No. - Say that you love me, Baz! - I'm sorry. - No. I do not love you. - You don't mean that. - Yes, I do. I want you out of my life. No, you don't. No! No, no. - Ow! - No, no, no, no. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Whoa, whoa, whoa. No, no, no. Oh, God. Oh, God. Back up, Baz. Back up. Why would you lie to me? No. Hey. Tommy. Tommy? Where are you, buddy? - I have to go. - No, no. - Stay here. - I have to go. Hey, wait. No. Are you okay? Tommy! Tommy? Tommy? You destroyed everything. Enough is enough, Emily. Tommy isn't safe. Don't you tell me what's safe for my son. He's my son! I'm trying to keep him safe from you. - Shut up! - Ah! Tommy? Tommy. No! No! No! No! Freeze! Do not move! Will he ever forgive me? Emily... No, no, no. No, no, no. No, no, no. - No, no, no. - Ow. No, no, no. Chloe, don't let him see me like this. Chloe. Wait. I'm so sorry. He is a completely different little creature than he was yesterday. Aren't ya? Hey, Maddie. Come here, sweetie. Hey, you okay? How's it been? Some ways I feel like I've never been more unprepared for anything in my life. And in other ways I feel like that I'm the only one that could do this. I'm just scared. Even though his parents did those terrible things, he's only gonna remember that they loved him. And I took that from him. I-I'm just scared he's gonna carry that resentment around his whole life. Sounds familiar. The last thing Emily said to me was, "Will he forgive me?" I ask myself the same thing. Hey, he has a huge advantage. Oh, yeah? What's that? You. We're not always who they want. That's not our job. He needs you more than anyone. You know how he feels. Now all you gotta do is love. So, what does the end look like? It looks like I got it! Come on, Tommy! Keep it away from Rob. Go!
