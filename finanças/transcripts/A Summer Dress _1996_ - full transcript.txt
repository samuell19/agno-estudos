Subtitle: Manvagtoo A Summer Dress Do you love me? Oh... Shut up! Back, when we were only ten. We played a game over and over again. Cops and robbers. Till it got dark. You always shot me in the heart. Bang, bang! You killed me. Bang, bang! I have fallen, bang,bang. And the sound of it, bang, bang. I never will forget. You and I grew up together. Seems to me we loved each other. But your only passions lay in those boyish games we played, bang, bang. You had your fun, bang, bang. It was you who shot, bang, bang. And you can bet on it, bang,bang. I never will forget. Why did you do like that? I need rest! I'm sick of your fag-songs! The neighbours are watching. Relax. We're on vacation. I become crazy of those neighbours! Ok.... you win. See you later. Someday when we were grown up. All along we should have known, love would replace the games from the past. But at one day, another came along. She stole your heart. No one's to blame. You never could have lied to me. You went with her I let your leave, bang, bang. You left me, bang, bang. I'm staying here behind, bang, bang. The sound of it, bang, bang. I will never forget. Teneis fuego? What? You got a light? Yes. Mind if I sit down here a minute? No, no. It's nice here, isn't it? Yeah, it's calm. How old are you? Eighteen. And you? Me too. Eighteen years. On vacation or so? Yeah. At the camping site? That's correct. Is it good? Yeah... it works. Wanna come with me to the woods? What for? I'm in the mood for love-making. You wanna? I don't know! Come. Let's go. Come! But my stuff... There is nobody else here! Come! It's nice here,no? Yes. Are you coming? Have you ever done something before? No. You'll see. It will be pleasurable. Want me to do it? Yeah. What's wrong? A guy is watching me. It is nothing. Close your eyes. A cigarette? Yeah, that's fine. Wait.I left my lighter on the beach. You had one all along! But I wanted to fire you up, my boy. You know, I lied to you too. Really? It wasn't my first time. Well, it was... with a girl. You're gay? No! I mean, I'm on vacation with a friend, and sometimes... For a gay boy you're a pretty good lay! I don't believe this. Where's my stuff? I think someone took it. How will I get home? I'm naked! I'll lend you something. Let's see... not that... All I've got is a dress. A dress! Listen. It's not a big deal. You got your bike. If you pedal fast, no one will know the difference. I can't go home in a dress! It's the dress or nothing! Hey, wait for me! Slow down... You make me fall! At least no one took the bike. Who would want this crappy bike? Return the dress tomorrow morning before I leave. Ok. You don't embrace me? Si. Ciao. What happened to you? I don't please you? Where did you get that dress? Don't you think I'm a pretty girl? Did the neighbours see you? Fuck the neighbours! Back, when we were only ten. We played one game again and again. Cops and robbers. Till it got dark. You always kissed... ...in the heart Fuck me. My boat's leaving. I came to return your dress. Oh, keep it. You might need it again. Thanks!
