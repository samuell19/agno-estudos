We are humans. We're just a boring couple from New Jersey, this was an idiotic idea. It was not an idiot idea. It was a dinner in Manhattan ... a night where we do not all night the children need to talk ... and what we do next week. - Look where it brought us. Should we call 112? - We are talking about Joe Miletto. And? - Those agents who wanted to murder us ... who has in his pocket. That guy owns agents. We can not trust agent. - What should we do? We can not go home, not to the police. Miletto, why does he Tripplehorn? Because they have the Flash Drive. If they return the flash drive now? - Why would they do that? Because we will find and we make sure they do. If they have the Flash Drive this is over. Fine, I stand behind you. I need you only one question. Condemn me. What is a Flash Drive? - Seriously? Phil, I can not. - That you put on the side of a laptop. This is such a computer memory stick thing? So we call in my office. We must stick thing that computer have to save our lives. How?

Can you look at the phone on the table? - Fine. This way. - I just wasted half my life. Look at the monitor. He left it there on the table, that was really a waste of time. The King of Siam is hellish. Thanks for your help, I'm sarcastic. Mother. Claw, you're welcome. We have a telephone. How to use we get behind a address to come? I think I know someone who can help us. What do you know this man again for? I saw him a few houses to show in the north. It is a few years ago, but I remember he was a security expert. He eventually bought a house here of an agent in this office. I forgot the address, but perhaps we can look into a file. Got a key? - No. May I have your coat? Yes, you cold?

I am curious to hear what happened here. While we sit drinking a beer, there are two people inside the bar ... The two people you've just let go. The Fosters? The Fosters. You have a good memory. But they come in and so on we know they will shoot at us. Mr. Foster? Tax lawyer was armed? That is strange. - That's weird. It is also dangerous, so we chased them. You know what, well done. Go home. If you want we can continue detect them. Nice evening. We have understood. - Say your prayers but. What was at computer stick that thing? What great books and photographs. Pictures of what? - Services rendered. And one of Joe's Milletto clubs Peppermint Hippo named. But that does not get out now, that computer Stick thing is at the bottom of river. And we will finish as agents find us. Explain to me one more time ... Honey! - If I get shot ... I would like to know why that is. What are you laughing at? - I think it's nice, but we are not really ... shot. - I think so. I do not think so. The strange thing is that Ledger had only but photographs and information from a customer. Crenshaw DA. - That guy with the broom? The Tripplehorn may have Flash Drive Miletto stolen ... but they pressed the DA off. Taste therefore reacted so strangely Miletto about when you started. I see. Does it have anything to do with Crenshaw? But there is definitely something to do Crenshaw with ... He is the key. And we must find a way to come to Crenshaw. The Tripplehorn have him at the Peppermint Hippo found. And we are Tripplehorn's? We are, yes. We could use some help. - Waxing, of course. Is that my tracksuit? Yes, that was in the trunk of your Audi ... and which is now parked at the East River ... and he can now use a beurtje ... which I do in the next decades programs will repay ... centuries old gun like that I've taken ... who is also proved useless. He just popped apart. - But for that reason we are not here. How unreal all this is may sound ... you after we have seen our evening only become stranger ... There were cars that were stuck together. One of those cars was yours ... I myself have a quite interesting evening and I am very tired ... how fun it is you again, would rather go to somebody else's door. I just wanted my wife to dinner ... I was hoping we could one evening with the feeling of yesteryear ... but now I only go home. Now that I have a plan to pull it off ... my plans are generally not so good, but now I have one ... and I need help. Although I would commit suicide if I muscle bundle to your look ... and your girlfriend is so beautiful that it seems like a glittering jet looks ... yet I know and believe I that a person in there is ... who understands exactly I now must make. So please, Holbrooke, can we come? Give us the chance to explain your what we want ... and want to fuck a shirt? Come on. Here it is, you know the plan yet? - Hardly. Let us inside. It is new, they must work tonight. I do not know what you're talking about. - I'm the new girl. Really? And who are you? I'm her pimp. - You're her pimp? Yeah asshole, he is my pimp, I can now work ... or should I call Joe Miletto to say that his later, Piccolo? I have no gum. The locker room is left. - Come on, pimp. Wait here. - Where are you going? That must be a monkey. Hey, I'm still down a man, do you think? Sorry I ... my God! I know, never mind. You look really great. Why is it so clear, it should still be dark and dim ... just love to take a 40 year old stripper / mother. Do your breasts once. - I had to attract opposite ... and then run. By I think I lost a nipple. No, you look great. - Really? Really. This was the only long enough was to cover my caesarean. I keep looking at your breasts. Let's go. I want you to buy. This is the end of days stuff. Honey, I think I can not. Of course you do this, you are a beautiful strong woman ... you are the mother of my children. I want you to go inside ... and let the Gucci pop. These Gucci pop it, and then we can go home. Come on you can do it. - I can. If you just want to look up. Fine, you can enter. No, you both. He likes you too nice. Someone pointed out by the pervert. - I can not. Yes, because you are a beautiful husband and the father of my children ... So you go in there and revolves around that pole as a refugee. There he is with those sunglasses. What happened to him by the hand that's dirty, that he do not need. Enough junk to clean. Can I help you? - We are here for Crenshaw. You can only join him in the neighborhood if he chooses you. Choose, for what? Carlton, go again to step aside. I think you avoid okay, honey. A wild western, lounge-like. Without syphilis. You have a big mouth, I think that's fine. And have your friend androgenouse included. Is he a man or a woman. I do not know. I'll let you guess.

Go ahead, if you spend time with me want, you deserve it. So go there but are. Women to one side please. Actually we are not ... we do not like dancing, We prefer to talk with you ... and then remain relatively quiet. We want to talk to you. - I am not here to talk ... whether you leave or go dancing. What is it? I do not feel it. Carlton, if you like ... their education as the door, please. We're just warming up, Now we will feel the heat. We are now going to happen. Now we go! - Count on that!

How much for a night? - $ 100,000. That's quite a bit. I know of no Women who are worth so much. How about a woman with a Flash Drive? How are you? We are Tripplehorn. They just keep coming with those weapons. Why do not we take a walk to talk about. Private. This was so beautiful can be. This is part of the plan right? I must go back into the underground for a refresher. Let's keep this simple ... you give me the Flash Drive or Collins breaks both arms of your wife. I have the flash drive hidden where nobody will find him ... Holbrooke if Grant is not the hour learn from us, until we are safe ... He will drive the content of that disclose. He is the ex-soldier We have interviewed the last night ... He is real. What's going on? Sorry, we seek a roof thing ' account, it only takes a minute. No, you get a minute. This is my roof, baby. It is good Claire, we they expect. We are really lost. They were just about Joe leave ... they have someone on hand with The flash drive is nothing to get here. Have you seen the flash drive? Do not worry, We will say nothing about those pictures. Shut up. - What kind of photos? Nothing. - Does he not? What I do not know? - I think I said too much. Sorry, but I can understand why you pornographic pictures of the DA have ... you never know when they come in handy. Close your mouth, Skippy. - Connect your vagina but you. No, if he says vagina, he means your face. You have said that what those Flash Drive stood with city contracts ... that way you wiped clean. All this time I keep the police away from you ... while you dirty pictures of me kept? - Very dirty pictures. You could sit in jail if not for me was. So watch your tone, Mr. DA. You have something to talk So my wife and I give you that room. Nobody move there because it is a piece easier if someone dies. As with "The Kill Shot". Put the gun down! - Come on, policeman. It's okay. - This is not good this is a bad idea. Now shoot me. - It will go on shooting anyone. Claire, look at me ... look at me! I have this under control ... I got this under control. Count to three. - What? Just count. - No, that does not work with adults with weapons. Trust me on this one. I've had enough ... my kids will have 90 minutes awake, so it stops here ... I count to three and then made everyone weapons. Does she seriously? A. - I think she thinks. Two. - They're kidding right? Three. This is the NYPD, let your arms fall and hands in the air.

Yes please, our children will is it bad frightened. No, we have sent somebody, They are wonderful to sleep with the babysitter. Thank God. What is your story? Just a boring married couple from New Jersey. So what about that elevator. I actually had my wife dinner in the city promised. I'm not sure but I think this the best pancake I've ever had. How did you come to that plan? It's like that book the book club ... Nasrin ensures that her brother and stepfather to squabble ... so they can be off to pulling through the desert ... and peace can menstruate. What? - You read the book? Of course. I have them all read. Why? - Because you care about. I only read the first 30 and the last page. Who has time to read. I love not even of those books. What? I sit here a little? I would do so again. Tonight, no, that was very dangerous. Not so much tonight. Just us. You and me, the kids, everything. I would do so again. I would choose you every time again. "Hope You've Liked & Enjoyed The Movie"
