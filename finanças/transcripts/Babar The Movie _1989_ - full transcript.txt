Ooh! Wow! BABAR: Ah, the perfect end to a glorious day. I think the parade was the best one ever! It was really glorious! All right, children. Time for bed. ALL: Bed? But Mama, we'’re not even tired yet! Now, children, mind your mother. Come on, Isabelle! We get to sleep on the top bunk tonight! Yippee! I thought it was our turn! Yeah, hurry! Good night, children. Good night, Papa! Good night, Father. Good night! Heh... [Sighing happily] ISABELLE: Papa? Aren'’t you coming to tuck us in? Of course, Isabelle. I wouldn'’t miss that for the world! Up you go! [Isabelle giggling] Can we have another parade tomorrow? I'’m afraid you'll have to wait until next year, Isabelle. The victory parade is an annual event. Vic-try parade? How come it'’s called a vic-try parade? Well, heh, heh. That'’s a long story, my dear. Good! Yeah, tell us! Yes! Please, Papa? Well... FLORA: Come on! ALEXANDER: Yeah, come on! But-- ISABELLE: Please? But-- How can you refuse? All right. CHILDREN: Yay! Just don'’t make it too long. Yeah, just long! Really long! Very well. This story begins a long time ago, when I was just a boy. [Trumpets sounding] I was still pretty new-- And Mama was just a little girl? Yes, that'’s right, Isabelle. Ahh! Now, where was I? Ah, yes, I was just a boy, and I was still very new at being king, and-- POM: Papa! What is it, son? Are there going to be any rhinoceros in this story? Yes, Pom, lots of rhinoceros. What about crocodiles? Well, yes, I believe there are. How about monkeys? Yeah, any monkeys, Papa? Children, please. Am I going to tell the story, or are you going to try and guess it? CHILDREN: Sorry, Papa. Now, as I was saying, this story begins when I was just a boy. I was still pretty new at being king, and it was to be my very first day in Royal Court. [Trumpets sounding] ♪ Presenting His Royal Majesty, Babar! King of the Elephants! ♪ BABAR: Was I nervous! Fortunately, my good friend The Old Lady was with me. Good luck, Babar. I'’m sure you'll do just fine. And of course, my two trusted advisors, Cornelius and Pompadour, were right by my side, as well. [Clearing throat] Sound the official horn! [Spritzing] Sound the official horn! [Feet scurrying] Sound the official horn! Ahem! Where is our official horn-blower? Here I am! Hi, Babar! Good luck today! [Panting] Sure hope you don'’t mess up or anything! Sound the official horn, please, Arthur! We'’re running a bit late, you know. But I didn'’t mean to be late, Cornelius! I would have been here on time, but I had to get dressed, and eat my breakfast, and-- The horn, Arthur. [Blowing horn] Like that? [Madame laughing] Yes, that will be fine. [Babar giggling] Ahem, right then. Uh, Troubadour, what monumental problem will we be looking at today? Ooh! This could prove to be most difficult. It seems we must choose a name for our annual parade! The annual parade? Oh, my tusks! Why, this could take years! How about the Elephantland Parade? The Elephantland Parade. I say, that'’s rather catchy! The Elephantland Parade! Oh, it'’s almost absolutely perfect, Your Majesty! [Clapping] Well done, Babar. Yay! Hooray for Babar! Of course, Your Majesty understands a delicate matter such as this should be given a great deal of thought. What? Pompadour is right, Babar. I mean, we can hardly come up with an entire name just like that. [Snapping fingers] I suggest we appoint a committee! A committee? A group of experts, Babar. Professional decision-makers. We'’ll have them look at every possible possibility. [Music playing] ♪ We set up a committee to discuss and interact ♪ ♪ Then authorize a study to investigate the facts ♪ ♪ Then summarize the data ♪ To find out what we have to do ♪ Get out all the files!

Celeste? Ugh, ah! Hey, you can'’t do that! Babar! Huh? Babar, I'’ve got to speak to you! Mademoiselle, you are interrupting an extremely important meeting! ARTHUR: Hey, Celeste! Ugh! I thought you were going with Mama to see Grandpa? Arthur, Grandpa'’s village is in terrible danger! Danger? Why? You'’ve got to get your army out there right away! Army? Army? Army?! Rataxes and his rhinos are on a rampage! Rataxes? Rhinos? Rampage? He'’s attacking all the villages, and snatching elephants! Oh, my! Grandpa'’s village could be next! Where'’s Mama, Celeste? Is Mama okay? I hope so, Arthur. She'’s still there. Oh! I ran back here as fast as I could to get help! Don'’t worry, Celeste. We'’ll do everything we can, won'’t we? Oh, uh, absolutely. There'’s certainly no harm in looking into the matter. We'’ll appoint a committee at once! A committee? Agreed! Make a note of that, Troubadour. We'’ll want a full report. BABAR: Wait a minute! We haven'’t got time for that. Let'’s just send the army out there, and have them set up some defences. Babar, please! A war is hardly something we want to rush into. But-- Cornelius is right, Your Majesty. After all, her story could be a complete exaggeration. Do you think I'’m making this up? Now, now, child. The point is that civilized animals simply don'’t go around snatching one another. I mean, it just isn'’t done. Oh, it most certainly isn'’t. [Laughing] The very idea, snatching elephants! Oh! Celeste! Celeste, wait! My word! Celeste! [Celeste crying] [Sniffling, crying] Celeste? My mama'’s in terrible danger! Why won'’t anyone believe me? I believe you, Celeste, and I really do want to help. [Crying] My mama means everything to me. I know how important a mother can be. If anything ever happened to her, I'’d just-- Don'’t worry, Celeste. Nothing'’s going to happen to her. I'’m going to go back up there and order them to get the army ready, and I'’ll lead them to your village myself! Oh, thank you, Babar! Hey, Celeste! Where are you going? I'’ve got to get back to my family. They need me! Come as fast as you can, Babar! We'’re counting on you! True to my word, I ordered Cornelius to call out the Elephant Army. I waited, and waited... and waited. Unfortunately, getting them ready to march was much more difficult than I had anticipated. Why does everything have to take so long? You may not think so, but you'’ve accomplished a lot today. But the army won'’t be ready for three more days! That does seem like a long time. The rhinos could be attacking right now! And Celeste is counting on me. [Owl hooting in distance] What should I do, Madame? That decision isn'’t mine to make. You have to do what you feel is right. But Cornelius and Pompadour said that we shouldn'’t rush into things. You are the king. In the end, the decision must be your own. Thank you, Madame. ♪ Be careful, Babar. ARTHUR: What are we doing? Hold this for me. Wouldn'’t it be better if we waited until tomorrow? Tomorrow could be too late, Arthur. But Babar, we can'’t stop Rataxes all by ourselves! Maybe not, but I have to try. What about Cornelius and Pompadour? They'’re going to be really worried! I know. I wish there was some other way, but... That'’s it! What?! Arthur, look! You look exactly like me! All us little elephants look the same. Yeah, but in my crown and robe, everyone will think you'’re me! Huh? It'’s perfect! They won'’t even know I'm gone. But I'’m going with you! I could be a big help-- oops. You can help me most by staying here, Arthur. Hold the fort till I get back. But Babar, what are-- I'’m depending on you now. [Sighing] Mm-hmm. Good luck, pal. Wait! I'’m not ready! What if Cornelius comes? CORNELIUS: Babar? Ah, there you are, Babar. Lovely night, isn'’t it? Just look at those stars. [Cornelius sighing] I could just stand here forever. [Gulping] I do hope you understand about all this army business. These things take time. It'’s not as if we can just go charging off into the jungle at night, you know. Heh, heh. Ah, well, good night, Babar. [Sighing with relief] Oh, and Babar! [Gasping] I think you'’re doing a fine job as king. Oh! So, with Arthur in my place, I was on my way... or so I thought. Hmm. Aha! [Whistling] Halt, who goes there? Why? Uh, I don'’t know. We'’re supposed to say that to anyone who tries to get in. But I'’m already in! Oh, uh... So, why don'’t you let me out, so I can try to come in, so you can say, "Halt, who goes there?" Oh, okay! [Whistling] [Grunting] Ugh! There you go! Thank you! [Whistling] [Grunting] Okay, now! BOTH: Halt, who goes there? Hmm? Halt, who goes there? Halt, who goes there? [Animal sounds] Huh? [Whistling] [Twig snapping] Rowr! [Babar laughing] [Snarling] Ahh! [Snarling] Meow! [Gulping] Suddenly, I was filled with an overwhelming feeling of foreboding. A fear that I might never see my home again. But I was determined to help Celeste and her mother. And with that as my guide, I marched off into the unknown. [Owl hooting] Hmm. According to this map, Celeste'’s village should be right about... here! [Gasping] Oh, no, Celeste! Whoa! Ugh! Roar! [Gasping] Celeste! Why did I let her go back alone? Ugh, ugh! Ahh! [Splashing] [Elephants crying] [Coughing] [Birds squawking] Ahhh! Run! [Gasping] [Laughing evilly] [Shouting, chaos] [Gasping] Mama! Go, go, run! Come on, you, let'’s go! No! Leave her alone! [Rhinos shouting] Ahh! [Screaming] [Young elephant crying] Huh? [Elephants trumpeting] [Trumpeting, shrieking] Stop it! Ugh! Ugh, oh! [Rhinos shouting] Get '’em, come on! Ah! Oh! [Elephants trumpeting] [Children crying] Heh, heh, rowr! [Children gasping] [Rhino snickering] Grrr! That'’s it! CELESTE: Mama! Huh? Mama! Celeste? Mama! What are you doing to my mother? Celeste! Run, Celeste! Save yourself! Not without you! I'’m coming! [Shouting, trumpeting] [Babar trumpeting weakly] We got her now! Ah! Babar! Ugh! Why, you little-- get him! Get him! Hold on, get him! Ugh! Huh? Oh! Grrrr! Ugh! [Moaning dizzily] Let go of me! Uggh! Oh, ugh! [Celeste screaming] Ha, ha, ha! BABAR: Celeste? CELESTE: Mama, Mama! I'’m... coming... ugh! Rataxes! Rataxes! RHINOS: Rataxes, Rataxes! CELESTE: Help! Help! Help! Somebody help me! What? Oh... Help! I'’m coming, Celeste. Ugh, oh! [Groaning] Help! Are you all right? Babar, thank goodness you'’re okay! Quick, help me out of here! Okay, hang on. [Sighing] Here, grab onto this. Ugh, got it! [Grunting] Babar, what happened? I thought you were bringing your army with you. Uh, I'’m afraid they won't be ready for a couple of days. A couple of days?! Ah! That'’s going to be too late! The rhinos will be miles away! No, Celeste, this time I'’m coming with you. We'’ll find your mother together. This way, young'’ins! Follow me. Grandpa! Oh, Grandpa, I'’m so glad you're all right! Eh? What'’s that? Uh, I said I'’m glad you're all right! Oh, yes, it was a terrible fight, but I took care of these young'’ins, hid them in the bushes. Babar and I have to go after the rhinos! Can you take the little ones to the palace? Uh, they'’re getting awfully hungry, though. Sir, go to the palace with the little ones! Oh, yes, some buttered buns would do fine! Uh, but don'’t you think I ought to get them to the palace first? It'’s much safer there, you know. Uh, you'’re absolutely right, Grandpa. Good luck! Heh, heh! Come on, little tykers! Old Tusk'’ll look after ya! [Thudding] Heh, heh! Phew! They'’ll be fine, Celeste. We'’d better get going. There'’s a long road ahead of us. [Birds squawking] CELESTE: I'’ve never gone this far into the jungle, have you? No, Cornelius says that no elephant has ever crossed into rhino territory. Babar, what exactly are we going to do when we find Rataxes? I don'’t know, but we'll think of something. I'’m sorry I let you down, Celeste. I am king, but I'’m also new at being in charge.

Ha, ha, ha! What did I tell you? A puny 1000. [Laughing] CELESTE: And 10,000 more on that side of the gate! 11,000, huh? Hmm, now that'’s something to think about. Yeah, and there'’s a million more guarding the palace! A million? And a zillion more waiting in reserve! BABAR: Zephir! Huh? Uh, give or take a dozen or so. Argh! Uh-oh. It was the voice, wasn'’t it? Stand back! Watch it! He'’s got a banana! And I'’m not afraid to use it! Ahh! Stand back, all of you! They'’re not standing back! Out of my way! En garde! Rrr! Ugh! Roarrr! Ahhh!

Oh! Now, that wasn'’t the least bit friendly. RATAXES: All right, elephants! You can make this easy for us, or hard for yourselves! What does he mean? Surrender completely, or be wiped off the map! Oh. You'’ve got one hour to decide! One hour? But this is unheard of! We should demand a complete apology! That'’s it! Demand an apology? We'’re going to take action! BOTH: We are? Citizens of Elephantland, they have us outnumbered, but I think I know how we can outsmart them. Are you with me? ELEPHANTS: Yes! Long live King Babar!
