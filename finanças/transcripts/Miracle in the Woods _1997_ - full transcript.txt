(bright music) (birds chirping) (pecans clattering) (birds chirping) - Enable us today, O' Lord, to reflect on the life of our beloved Emma Barnsdow. May her tradition of love and charity live on in the hearts of her two beautiful daughters, Sarah, who has joined us from Atlanta today, and our own dear Wanda. Bless and keep them both. Amen. - [People] Amen. - Thank you, Reverend. - Reverend. (people conversing softly) - Darling, if there's anything I can do. - Thank you, Reverend. (Ruby cooing) (people conversing in distance) (Sarah sighs) Thank you for coming. - It was very nice, Wanda. - What? - The ceremony. Mother would've been very proud. - Hi, Gina. - Hi, Aunt Wanda. - Edmond. - You're not staying? Everybody's coming over to the house. - Well, I'd love to, but I need to get back to Atlanta. - Jerry's very busy. Gina and I are gonna take him to the airport, and then we'll be back. I hope we don't miss too much. - No, anytime is fine. - [Sarah] Bye, dear. (somber music) (insects chirping) (mellow music) - Hey, there, baby, did you know that when I was a little girl, your grandma had a magic yellow rain bucket, and she used to use it whenever she wanted to make it stop raining. All she had to do was just set it outside, and before you knew it, we could go back out and play again. Yes. Just like this one. - Almost as pretty as her mama. You okay, honey? - Yes. - You need anything? - No, but thanks. (Rudy cooing) - I'll put Ruby to bed. Come on. - Come on, baby. (crickets chirping) - Gina, take off the headset. It won't hurt you to be sociable. Gina! (heavy metal music plays in headphone) Thank you. (soft knocking on door) Wanda! You up? Hi, sorry we're late. Jerry's flight was delayed. Gina. - Gina, sweetheart, I didn't see you out there. How you doing, sweetheart? Come on in. Why don't you go on inside. - Wanda, I wanted you to know how much I appreciate everything you did for mama, and I'm sorry I didn't come sooner. - I'm surprised you came at all. - That was quite a turn out you had. I'm sorry. Business has been so hectic these past few years. I hope you know it wasn't personal. I hardly see Jerry anymore. How you holding up, Wanda? (Wanda sighs in frustration) - Save it Sarah. - I was thinking of asking you to visit up in Atlanta, but I guess that's out of the question. - You can stay in the back room. Eddie had it fixed for mama when we moved her from the nursing home. - Oh, that's real nice, but I think we'll get a hotel room. - Well, there's no point in that because Mr. Hampton's coming at eight o'clock tomorrow morning to read the will. - Hi, Eddie I hope we didn't wake you. - No. (coughs) No, we're glad you're here. Can I help you with your bags? - They're in the car. - We're gonna be having breakfast before Mr. Hampton gets here in the morning. Gina can sleep on the pull out sofa. You'll wanna keep the fan on, so the room doesn't get too hot. When you use the bathroom, just jiggle the handle on the back of the toilet, okay? (birds chirping) - I'd also like Wanda to have my China tableware, my 19-inch Magnavox television set, shoes, clothing, and all remaining belongings not so designated in above mentioned exhibits one and two respectively. (attorney coughs) Moving on. Finally, to my daughter Sarah, I bequeath my leather reclining chair. - What that's it? I get the strata lounger lounger, and she gets everything else? - Maybe mama didn't think you needed anything, Sarah. - What that's it? - I'm afraid so. - Well, what about the property? - That's right the pecan grove. Mama didn't say anything? - I wasn't aware of any pecan groves. You see it's unfortunate, but my partner Mr. Lattimore, who prepared this for your mother, he died several years ago. - It's about a hundred acres up off Highway Seven. Surely, that's worth something. - Well, Benjamin he was real thorough. I just can't imagine how it slipped through. - Have you been out there? I mean do you know what kind of condition it's in? - The only time I saw it was when I was driving by. Mama used to go out there once in a while though until she got six. - (sighs) So what happens now? I mean how long can this take in probate? - Oh, well, I know Judge McNamara. I suppose I could speed it through. Of course, you know by default, you both would be named as beneficiaries. - So we split it equally 50/50? (gentle music) (birds chirping) - Mom, when are we going home? This place sucks. - Well, it is certainly not the way mother described it. - [Wanda] Well, of course not. Nobody took care of it after daddy died. (gentle music) - To make things really exciting, here's an old paint can. Perhaps left behind by some ancient civilization. Maybe there's a slug we can put on mom's head. - Oh, look. Look that must be the old tractor daddy had. Oh, he used to talk about this all the time. - Uh-huh. - Mom. Mom. Mom. - Gina. - There's a pathway. - Yeah. (Sarah sighs) Oh, don't go. Gina, you'll wreck your outfit. - The grove suddenly came alive. A secret passage leading deep into the nether regions. - [Sarah] Gina wait up. Gina. (cat mews) - Oh, look. It's a baby panther. Did you lose your mother? - [Sarah] Gina, don't touch that cat. What the? - Oh, it's daddy's old pecan shack. - I think someone's living in there. (door creaks) - Jasper. William, come on babies it's super time. Mama done made some okra and corn bread. Skeeter. Edda Mae, y'all come on now. - Oh, my gosh. (leaves rustling) (birds chirping) - Who in there? (gun firing) (women gasping) Y'all get off this land, you hear? This here is private property! No trespassing! (birds chirping) (insects chittering) I'm warning you. - Gina don't. - Who's that? Who is that? - (stammering) I'm. - Field Pea is that you? Praise the Lord that is you. You done come all the way from Clearwater to see me. - [Sarah] Gina. - I ain't seen you since the cotton farm. - Excuse me? - Back in Alabama. (Gina stammers) You do remember, don't you? Oh, Field Pea, did they hit you too? - Ma'am, I think you have the wrong person. - You're confusing my daughter with someone else? - Don't be silly. I's knowed Field Pea since she was knee high to a dog. - I'm sorry, I didn't quite get your name. - My name's Lilly, Lilly Cooper. Any friend of Field Pea's is a friend of mine. - Sarah Weatherby this is my sister Wanda. - Howdy do. - Hi. - This is our property. - I beg your pardon. - Well, our mother's. - Mrs. Cooper, by any chance, did you know our mama Mrs. Barnsdow? - Emma? - Yes. - Emma Barnsdow? Sure I know her. She about road up to Orangeburg. Stock up on some dry goods for the winter. Gone be a cold one, you know. - She let you live here? - Of course she do. If she ain't back in a few weeks, I'm gone be mess in a of hot water trying to get this crop in before the freeze. But why? Who's asking? - We was just wondering. - Well, wonder on your own time. I got a family to feed. William. Jenny. (cats mewing) Lulu Bell, y'all come on now because it's supper time. (birds chirping) (camera rolling) - I can't believe she's been living out there. - That's not right. It's our place now. - But mama let her live there. You know she was always helping people like that. - That doesn't mean we have to be responsible for her. A woman like that living by herself she could get hurt. She's a liability, Wanda. Besides there'd been property taxes and maintenance costs. We can't keep that place up. - So what are you gonna do? - I don't know. We can decide tomorrow. - [Jimmy] I can remember when you and your little sister were playing in the mud out behind Watson's Hog Farm. You used to pull her down there-- - [Sarah] Jimmy, I'm sorry to say, I have not been doing much of that lately. Based on the price of some of the other tracks out there, I'm guessing the place will go for about 150,000, if we don't parcel, is that correct? - Yes, well, but I can't guarantee the prices will hold up now. (laughs) - Well, then we'll have to move quickly, won't we? I'd like to put it on the market as soon as possible. - Yes, but you understand, I have to have Wanda's consent. I can't-- - You'll have Wanda's consent. I just didn't wanna go sticking any legal documents in her face right now. It's a very bad time, you understand. - Okay, yeah, sure. - All right, well, let me know the minute you have any interests. I'd like to have this wrapped up by the end of the week. - This week yes. This week. Yes, thanks. This week. (gentle music) (birds chirping) (insects chittering) - Hello. Hello anybody home? Hello anyone? It's Field Pea. (cats mewing) - Field Pea, you done missed your train. - Huh? - It left about a hour ago. - So you really live out here? - Course, I do, me and my family. - You know that was really cool how you shot that gun yesterday. You scared my mom to death. Oh, not that I wanted you to scare her. It's just cool how you got her attention that's all. - Mm. (cats mewing) What you got there, Field Pea? You taking pictures? - Making a movie. - You always was interested in pictures. - I was. You wanna be a movie star, Ms. Copper? - Oh, shh, what I need that for? - Well, you'll be famous. Get rich and stuff. - I had a lot of money once. More than I knew what to do with. - Really? How'd you get it? - You remember, silly. It all started that night that Skinny Babcock turned that old barn over by Stony Creek into a dance hall. (Lilly chuckles) You came all the way over to Ms. Handleman's just to help make me up pretty. Course, everybody was saying how funny it was that you was my friend. But you didn't pay them no mind. You said, "Best friends don't look "at each other for what's on the outside. "It's what's on the inside that counts." So when I decided to get me a husband, you wanted to help me. - Now remember act like you wanna have lots of babies. Farmers like that. - I don't want a farmer, Field Pea. Farmers smell funny. - (laughs) Don't be silly, and don't be too pushy neither. Men don't like a woman with a mind of her own. You just let them do all the talking, for a while anyway. (giggles) (lively music plays in hall) (people chattering loudly) (engine revs) - All right, y'all. (people chattering) - [Lilly] You told me don't be shy. You said, "Find me a good one and just go and get him. "Because if I didn't, somebody else would." (lively dance music plays) - Excuse me, Miss. Care to dance? - Hey, hey, now. Stay on over here, Henry. (soft jazzy music) Now, yeah. You coming over? - Well, young lady either you came over here to ask me for a cigarette, or you'd like to dance. Which is it? (soft jazzy music) - And my mama she worked on her daddy's farm. That's how Field Pea and me came to be friends. She did my hair for me, see? (horn honks on street) - Darling, be careful this is the only truck I got. But that still doesn't explain how a nice young lady like yourself learned to drive an automobile. - After mama died, I got a job driving cotton trucks to support myself. - Mm, you a truck driver, huh? Well, a skill like that could come in handy I suppose. I tell you what, pull on up to the house yonder, we'll stretch our legs a little bit what you say? Well, now, how do you like my house? - Oh, Mr. Cooper, it's beautiful. Where'd you get all your money? - Well, I'm a businessman, young lady. So how about a toast? To the most beautiful lady at the dance. (insects chirping) (frogs croaking) - So did you marry him? Was that how you got the cotton farm? - Well, Mr. Cooper was a little older than I had hoped for, but he had his charm. - Wow, what a way to meet a guy. I met Ray at the mall. He works at a juice bar. But don't tell mom that. She doesn't know about him yet. - No, no, no. You know, I almost forget. I been saving something for you. - [Gina] You have? - Yep. (birds chirping outside) (gentle music) - Oh, god. (dramatic music) Jerry. (engine revs) (birds chirping) - Hey, Aunt Wanda. - Hey, Gina. - Look what she gave me. I saw that lady again, and she said that this is the necklace that we bought together at Woolworths before she went to this big dance. - Wait, wait, wait, wait. You went all the way out there by yourself. - Yeah, don't tell mom. - Gina. - She kept on calling me Field Pea, and telling me about this guy that she met and used to live with on this cotton farm like a jillion years ago. - Now, Gina, wait a minute. You think that's a good idea to go out there again? - Oh, yeah, she's cool. She gave me some money to buy her some stuff like soup and stamps. - Postage stamps? - Yeah, it's like I'm some long-lost friend or something. It's really weird. - Wanda, I'm glad to see you. I got to talk to you about the property. Hi, darling. I talked to Jimmy White. He said if we move quickly, we could maybe get about a 150 for it. We'll split that of course. So that's 75 a piece. So I gave him the go ahead to find a buyer. - $75,000. - Pretty nice, huh? - Well, yeah, if I decide to sell. - What do you mean? Why wouldn't you? - I don't know. What if I like it? - [Sarah] Wanda, this is not a joke. We stand to make a lot of money here. - What about Mrs. Cooper? - She shouldn't be out there anyway. I was hoping to get this wrapped up by end of the week. - So you can get back to Atlanta is that it. You can't stand being here one more day. You know it's a big decision. An extra day or two to think about it isn't gonna hurt anything. So how long you been living here, Mrs. Cooper? - Well, since that old pecan tree fell. - Oh, I see. Have you ever thought about moving someplace a little bigger? You know, I'm sure the church could help you find something. - [Lilly] Oh, no I got a family here. Ain't that right, Jasper? (cats mewing) - [Wanda] How often did you see my mama? - Who? - Mrs. Barnsdow from the church. - Emma? - Mm-mm. - All the time. Matter of fact, she's supposed to be here tomorrow. We'll be hiring for the fall soon. - Mrs. Cooper. - Mm-hmm. - My mama, Mrs. Barnsdow. - Mm-hmm. - You know, she died last week. Oh, she was real sick. - No. Emma's in Orangeburg. That's just a rumor. Too much work to be done around here. - Why don't you tell her about the cotton farm, you know, like you were telling me. - It was the most wonderful place in the world. - Did you really have a cotton farm? - Yes, I did, first home I ever had. Being an orphan and all, I never had no proper place till I met Henry. - Henry was her husband. - I was planning on having lots of babies. That's why when I moved in, I tried to make sure they'd have a good home to grow up in. (dramatic music) But Mr. Cooper had other plans. With him, it was always work, work, work. - [Henry] Lily. (dramatic music) (engine revs) - [Wanda] So you were driving that truck for your husband's business, huh? - [Lilly] Mm-mm, and sometimes for days on end. Why he'd have me trucking cotton seed clear into Mississippi and sometimes to folks that didn't even look like farmers. I didn't know who my husband was doing business with, but we was doing okay, I suppose. - [Wanda] Mrs. Cooper it's been a pleasure talking to you. - And it's been a pleasure talking to you too. - Well, thank you. - Field Pea, don't forget to tell Emma about the hiring. We gone need 12 good workers this year. - Okay. - Okay. Oh, oh, oh, Field Pea. Field Pea, sit this bucket out there because we sure don't need no more rain come harvesting time. - But don't you see? It's the same thing. That's who mama got the story of the bucket from. Mrs. Cooper told her. - Yeah. So. - So, it's just neat that's all. - Darling, $75,000 would be neat. (birds chirping) (engine revving) - And then every year at Christmas, daddy would give hayrides to all the children in town. There're lots of memories out here. Oh, my goodness that must be my daddy's old tractor. - I think there's real investment potential here. Something special. Now if I was to buy this place, I'd think about clearing out some of those trees and putting a house right there. That way you'd have a view all the way to Shepherdton County. - [Boy] Hey, dad. - [Jimmy] Let me show you. - Oh, no dear not that way. Here let me show you this over here. (people chattering in distance) Hey. - Oh, you still here, huh? - Well, I have some good news. Found a buyer for the land. - You have? - The offer's not quite what we asked. But Jimmy thinks it's fair. So you wanna hear how much? - (coughs) Sarah, I'm not selling the land. You go head sell your half. - No one's gonna buy half a pecan grove, Wanda. - Look it's just not right. - What do you mean? - Well, Mrs. Cooper lives there. We can't just go and kick her off. She was mama's friend. - Look it is too bad that know one knew to look after her when mama got sick. But the truth is that woman should've been in a nursing home a long time ago. - We are not putting her in any nursing home, Sarah. - She could die out there, Wanda. Is that what you want? For crying out loud, she could waste away by herself in that shack! - And what would you care? You want me to believe you care more about her than you did about our own mother! - I cared about other mother. - You show up here after three years acting like, "Oh everything's just fine." - I had obligations you know that! - Mother needed you! - What happened was between mother and me! It had nothing to do with you! - Oh, like hell it didn't! You abandoned her, our own mother. I am not selling that land, Sarah. - Well, yeah, but just because you own it, doesn't mean that I can go out there and throw her off. She's got squatter's rights. - What are those exactly? - Well, if she's been out there as long as you think she has, she's got a right to stay. - That's ridiculous I own the property. - Well, now you may have the title, but that lady's got a homestead. Nothing either one of you can do about the other, unless she dies or just moves on. - But she's not well. She needs help. - Well, that may be. She got any family? - I don't know. - Well, unless she decides to go on her own, there's really nothing you can do about it, because by law it requires a family member to admit her to a nursing home. - Jerry she can stay out there as long as she wants. I'm telling you it is useless. (stammering) No, it's not possible. All right. I'll be home tomorrow. - Is daddy coming? - [Sarah] No, Gina. - Can we go out and see Mrs. Cooper? - Why would we go out and see her? - Because she's my friend. - How can she be your friend? You've only seen her once. Wait have you been going out there? With Wanda. Oh, terrific. (suitcase unzipping) - Well, what's wrong with that? Mrs. Cooper's neat. - That woman has made things very difficult for your father and me. We're going home tomorrow. - We can't. She needs me. I'm her only friend. - [Sarah] Gina. - Just one more visit, please mother, so I can say goodbye. We could take her some groceries, at least we could do that. (Sarah scoffs) Her whole family has a name every one of them right Mrs. Cooper. - Yeah. (door thuds) - Well, that's fine. - Thank you so much, honey. That's awful sweet of you, appreciate that. (birds chirping) - Say goodbye, Gina, we got to hit the road. - Mother. - Gina. - Bye, Mrs. Cooper. - Goodbye, darling. Good bless you. - Well, looks like I'm too late. What's going on here, hmm? - Gina and I were just about to leave. - Oh, you were? - Mm-hmm. - Well, why does Gina have to go? She could just stay with me and Eddie, you know, till school starts. - I don't think so. Besides, I don't appreciate your bringing her out here without my knowing it. Come on, Gina. - Goodbye, Aunt Wanda. - Bye, Gina. - (gasping) Oh, look at that. Look at that it's a baby. It's a baby. Oh, my it's a baby. - Are you okay, Mrs. Cooper? - Yes, darling. - You wanna hold her? - Can I hold her? - Sure. This is Ruby. Yeah, Ruby's my pride and joy, aren't you, darling? - I had a baby once. - You did? - A little boy. Upset his daddy though. I found out after we got married that me and Mr. Cooper had different ideas. Raising a family wasn't one of his. My baby, little baby. (sobs) I loved the babies. (somber music) (thunder rumbling) (wind blowing) (thunder rumbling) (dramatic music) - Lily. Lily. (thunder crashing) (heavy gasping) (heavy gasping) (car horn blaring) (tense music) (Lilly gasps) (suspenseful music) (Lilly gasping deeply) - Miss. Miss, you all right? Let me help you come here. Let's get around here. All right, ma'am, get up here. Lean on this. There you go. (Lilly gasping deeply) You running moonshine? Lucile, she needs help. Come on help me here. Get her. Get her to the car. Come on ma'am we got you. (baby crying) (dramatic music) - It's okay, ma'am. It's okay. (baby crying) - Here's you little boy, Miss. He's okay. (tender music) - My baby. God bless you. God bless you both. - So what happened? What did you do? - Yeah, Mrs. Cooper, about your son where is he? - Wherever he is I know he's all right. - Well, where is he? Is he still alive? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - It's okay you don't have to tell us. - [Wanda] We'll, see you tomorrow is that okay? (dramatic music) - Let's go. - Goodbye, Mrs. Cooper. I'll be back I promise. (Lilly sobs) - That woman is absolutely nuts. But thank heavens she has a son. - Why do you care? Oh, I gotta say goodbye to Aunt Wanda. - You don't have to. We're staying. You have a phone number for anyone named Cooper. Mm-mm, Cypress, Alabama. Yep, whatever you got. (door closing) Just one. Thanks. All right you keep calling these, and if you find anything, call me. - Wait, where are you going? - I'll be back in a couple of hours. There must be something. - No, the only Henry Cooper I can find from Alabama that matches your information he died in 1972. But he was born back in 1890, so that makes him a little old to be her son. - That must be her husband. From what she was saying, I'm guessing her son to be about 50. - No, there's no record Mr. or Mrs. ever had a child together. - There isn't? - No ma'am. Believe me, I looked at every database and every county down there. If a person had ever set foot in that state dead or alive, I'd find him for you. I am a tax assessor. Are you sure that woman ever really had a son? What else has she been telling you? - Now did you know I'm a nurse, Mrs. Cooper? I'm over at Fairview Hospital, and from what I can tell, you better watch this because it's getting infected. Now. - Nothing but a little scratch. - Yeah, well, you gotta be careful now. When is the last time you saw a doctor? - I don't need no doctor because I ain't sick. (cat mewing) (birds chirping) Everything gone look so pretty when he gets here. He'll have a good home to grow up in. - Your son? Well, I thought you said that-- - He'll be here any day now I know it. (door creaks) (cats mewing) - Mrs. Cooper, where is he? (thunder rumbling) Is he coming? - Did you really have a son, Mrs. Cooper? - He was the sweetest thing. He never caused me one bit of trouble, and that smile, that smile on his face, and it was brightest on Sunday morning when I was taking him to church. - [Wanda] What happened to him, Mrs. Cooper? (dramatic music) (Lilly hums softly) - Lily. (dog barking in distance) You got time to lounge around the house all day. You can make them deliveries over in Mississippi. Now the neighbor's gonna watch the baby while you're gone because I ain't got time to mess with him. - The neighbor? He can't take my baby. - Oh, come on now, woman, it's gone be all right. - No, I ain't gone leave him I won't. I know what you doing. I seen what you got in them bags, and it ain't legal. - Let me tell you something. How you think we got his house that you love so much, huh? Now you go do something stupid, we could lose everything we got. You wouldn't want that for little Henry now would you? So come on. (dramatic music) Come on you it's gone be all right now come on. I'll talk to you next week. (bird squawks in distance) (dramatic music) - Hi. Hi, baby. Hi. It's okay, honey. It's okay. Mama ain't gone leave you again. I promise. (dramatic music) (people chattering in distance) (typewriter keys clacking in office) Excuse me. Excuse me, sir. - Yes, ma'am. Mrs. Lily, what can I do for you? (ominous music) - Sir, my husband is a moonshiner. I know because he makes me deliver his liquor for him. He hides it in bags of cotton seed. - In cotton seed. Hm-mm, come here. (telephones ringing in station) (dramatic music) - He makes it in his barn at night time. I don't want my boy being raised around him. I'm ready to talk to whoever you want. I can tell them everything. - Now that won't be necessary, ma'am. I'll tell you what. You go on home and you act like nothing ever happened. I'll get my men together, and we'll come over there tonight. But don't you let on a word to nobody, you hear? - Yes, sir. - Don't wanna scare him now do we? Yeah, go on. (suspenseful music) (insects chittering) (dramatic music) (doors thudding) - It's gone be fine. (dramatic music) - Well, lookie here. (ominous music) Where you going so fast? Hold on now. Nobody gonna hurt you, Mrs. Cooper. Look at little Henry. (baby crying) Look how scared he is let me see that little baby. - What are you doing? No, my baby give me my son! - You ain't got no son. - Give me my son. Don't want him growing up with his daddy. I'll take care of that right now. - Henry! - Get that baby out of here. (Henry screaming) Hey. - Henry! - Get her. - Henry, give me my son! Give me my son! (Henry screaming) - Since you ain't got enough sense to keep her quiet then I sure will. You're damn lucky I got here when I did! Get her in the car. - Henry, Henry! - [Gina] What happened where did they take him? - I don't know. - [Wanda] Does your husband have him, or did they put him in a home? - (sobs) I don't know. - Oh, Mrs. Cooper. (dramatic music) - Do you think you could find him? Can you find him? - Yes. Field Pea will find him. - (sobs) Thank you, baby. - I'm telling you, sheriff, the woman is crazy. She said she had a son, but there's no birth certificate, no death certificate, nothing. You should see the place she's living. There's no running water. No electricity. - Mrs. Weatherby. - She could also be dangerous! She has a gun. I've seen it. - Now there's no law against that. - Unless she's used it on somebody or threatened someone. - She has, Sheriff. She has threatened my daughter and me. (telephone ringing) - Hello. Gina. She did. Oh, my gosh, I'll be right there. Okay, bye. - [Eddie] Baby, what's wrong. - I gotta go down to the grove. It's Mrs. Cooper. - She all right, do you me to do anything? - It's between me and Sarah. You just watch Ruby I'll be back shortly. - Now please ma'am we just want a few words with you. This is ridiculous. That thing probably won't even shoot. - Yes, it will. (car engine revving) - Mrs. Cooper. Don't make it any worse now put the gun down. Now Mrs. Cooper all we wanna do is talk to you. Mrs. Cooper. I gotta a social worker out there with me, and she just wants to make sure you're okay. - What's going on here? There is nothing wrong with her. - [Sheriff] She just wants to make sure you're okay. Now maybe she can help you with your living arrangement. - No, she wasn't need any help. - Put your your stuff down. Now you shouldn't be doing this. - [Sarah] Wanda. - It's okay. It's just me. I'm here. All right. Come on. Now listen nothing's gonna happen all right. I'm not gonna let it. Here just give me that. You're not gonna need that. That's it. There you go. - Now, ma'am I understand you have a son that might could help us out here. Now all we want-- - You ain't got no son! - Give me my son! - Stay with me, ma'am. - No, no, no, no. - No, no, no, no. - Come with us. - Let go of her. - Easy. - No! - Let go of her. - Easy now. (suspenseful music) - No, no let me go! - Stop that! - Let me go! No! Henry. No, let me go! - [Wanda] You're hurting her! - She's not well! - How dare you. - I am trying to help. - You have never helped anyone but yourself. (dramatic music) - No! - Where are you talking her? - No! Leave me alone! Leave me alone! - It's okay, it's okay. - Leave me alone! - Watch your head. (Henry screaming) - Get in there! - Oh, my baby! Give me my baby. Give me my baby. Give me my baby. Give me my baby! (police siren blaring) (birds chirping) - Gina. G, are you okay? - I hate her, I just hate her. - Oh, honey. - Why is she doing this? We used to be friends. Now it's like I don't exist. - I know she used to be my friend too, G. Oh, gosh I hope I didn't put you two at odds over this. But she still is your mother. You gotta respect that. - It's hard. - I know. - She acting so strange lately. She didn't tell me that she was leaving till this morning. - She went back to Atlanta? - She said she had to be with dad. How's Mrs. Cooper? She okay? - Oh, well, she just keeps talking about her friend Field Pea. "Where's Field Pea", she says. Yeah, she's at the hospital. They're doing some psychological tests on her. But so far they haven't found anything wrong with her. Of course, everybody thinks she's a little crazy. But there's no law against that, right? You know why don't we find something to take to her after supper tonight, huh, make her feel more at home? Come on let's do that. - How long will I have with him? - A few minutes. I've been with him all morning. He's not doing so great. - He's cooperated with the investigation in every way. There's no reason for this. - I'm sorry, Sarah. - Jail. Isn't it your job to keep him out? - We're doing what we can. Now if you come up with the bail, we'll arrange for him to go home tonight. Sarah, are you okay? - Don, you mind? - Sure. - Oh, Jerry. (door creaks) - Well, I guess we knew this was coming. - This is so... How did he let this happen? - He stalled as long as he could, Sarah. I had to turn myself in or risk being arrested somewhere. So how's it going? Have you talked to Wanda? Have you come up with anything? - No. - Nothing at all? - No. - Well, there has to be something that you can do. How long do you think I can sit in here? - Jerry, I'm doing everything I can. My sister will probably never speak to me again. And Gina god knows how I wanna tell her about this. She has no idea. I don't know what to do anymore. Tell me what's right. I wanna do what's right. (locks disengaging) - Jerry. (Sarah sighs) - You have to get me out of here. - How? How? (sobbing gently) - [Operator] Dr. Collins call urology lab B. Dr. Collins call urology lab B. - [Wanda] Hi. - Mrs. Cooper, looks like you have company. Just had her dinner. - [Wanda] How's she doing? - She still has periods of confusion. They gonna do some more blood work before they let her go. - Mrs. Cooper, we're here. We bought you some things. It's Field Pea, Mrs. Cooper. - Field Pea. Field Pea, you come to save me. - Save you from what? (Lilly gasps deeply) (somber music) (machines whirring) - Lily, Lily. We're going to try and relax you a bit. Everything will be okay. (Lilly mumbling) - Did you find him? Did you find my son? - Your son is with the neighbors, ma'am. He's okay. They're going to take care of him until you're well enough to go home. - But I'm better already. - No, sheriff says you've gotta say here a while. (dramatic music) Why don't you write your son a letter. (Lilly gasps) - Shh, shh, shh, shh. Mr. Cooper. (Lilly groans) You said they gave your son to a neighbor. Do you remember his name? (Lilly groans) - No. - All right. No, it's okay, shh. (dramatic music) There's gotta be a way we can find out who that neighbor was. - Maybe if she can remember where she lived. What street she was on. - Hi, Gina. Wanda, could I talk to you a minute? - No, I have nothing to say to you. You have no idea who you're dealing with here. She has made this whole thing up. - What are you talking about? - I didn't know how to break this to you earlier, but I talked to a guy at the tax assessor's office. He said there is no record that Mrs. Cooper ever had a son. I am so sorry. - Well, that's a lie. - She doesn't have a son. - Yes, she does. - Mrs. Cooper you don't have a son do you? - Sarah. - Mom. - Please tell the truth. You don't have a son. - [Sheriff] You ain't got no son. - Give me my little Henry! Henry! (suspenseful music) No, give me my baby. No, my baby, give me my baby! - It's all right little fella. (Henry crying) Mr. Boyd will take care of you. (Henry crying) The sheriff want you to stay with Mr. Boyd for a while. - Mr. Boyd. They gave my baby to Mr. D.W. Boyd. - She remembered. - What is she talking about? - Boyd you said? (Lilly panting) (Lilly sobbing) (gentle music) - How many Boyd's can there be in Alabama? - It's all right sweetheart. We'll try again tomorrow. - You know what if he doesn't live there anymore? What if he's somewhere else. - Hello. - Hi, my name is Gina. I got your number from information. I'm looking for someone named D.W. Boyd and I was wondering if by any chance you're related to him. - [Man] You got the wrong number. - Come on, I'll fix us a snack, huh? Let's see. What looks good? - [Man] Hello. - Hi, I'm looking for D.W. Boyd. You're not related to him are you? - Yeah. - You are? - [Man] Uh, yes, I am. He's my great uncle. - He is! - [Man] Why are you with the IRS? - No, no don't hang up please! I'm looking for somebody that he knew a long time ago. A little boy named Henry Cooper. - I know a Henry. My great uncle raised him. - Is he alive is he okay? - Well, I suppose, I hadn't seen him in a while. - Well, do you know where he is? - [Man] Last I heard he was working on a river barge here in Alabama somewhere. - He's in Alabama! We can find him y'all. Thank you so much! - See she has a son. - Do you know how I can reach him? - Good. Mrs. Cooper's gone need a place to live, because I sold the land. (ominous music) - Look, Sarah, I don't care who this buyer is or where you found him. Until you have my signature, there is no sale, you understand that? We gotta find Mrs. Cooper's son. She's been waiting for this her whole life. Can't you see how important this is? - So Mr. Boyd said that he would leave a message for your son at church. - Praise the Lord. He go to church. Is he coming? - Well, we hope so. We won't know for sure till he calls us back. - Well, why wouldn't he? I'm his mama. - Oh, he will. I know he will. - Field Pea. - How did you meet our mama? I mean how did you end up on that pecan grove? - Field Pea remember, don't you baby? (dramatic music) - Lilly Cooper. (bright music) - You've been here so long. How did you manage? I'm so sorry. We've been out of the country. I had no idea until I got your letter. I'm so sorry. - Field Pea. - So would you like to come and stay with Bob and me for a little while till you get your feet on the ground? - Huh? - My husband and I would like you to come and live with us in South Carolina. Hey, sweetie. You'd like that wanna you, Lilly? - I can't. I gotta go home. I gotta find my baby. (engines revving) (bus horn honking) - Now, bus 493 goes straight to Clearwater Alabama. But it doesn't leave till midnight. Are you sure you still wanna wait? I just hate that you won't let me drive you. - No, I'll be fine. You go on now. I got me a sandwich and I'm gone sit over here and wait. - Well, you don't have to be so darn stubborn about it. Here. If it doesn't work out down there, this is my address, and I want you to come and see me right away. I've missed you. Promise you'll write. Kiss Miss Lilly goodbye. (dramatic music) - Goodbye, Emma. (people chattering) (crickets chirping) (frogs croaking) (dramatic music) - [Operator] Bus leaving for Savannah and all points north. Bus for Savannah, Georgia is now leaving. - Henry. Henry. (dramatic music) (engine idles) (dramatic music) (birds chirping) (dramatic music) (bird squawking) (birds chirping) (cat meowing) (Lilly gasps) Hi, kitty. Hi. (dramatic music) (bird squawks in distance) (cat mews) (coins clanking) (gentle music) (bright music) (bird squawking) Thank you. I've been thinking. Thank you, but I can't stay here. That sheriff might find me and my husband. - Well, you can't just wander, from place to place all the time. It's not safe. - I'll be all right. - Well, I won't have it. If you're worried about that sheriff, you can stay in the pecan grove. There's a caretaker shack out there that you could have. No one could find you. (bright music) (workers chattering) Well, I'm afraid it's not much, but you stay here as long as you like. - (gasps) I'll take good care of it too. I can send for my son once I saved up. (bright music) - I wish I knew how to help you, Lilly. I'm so sorry I can't do more. - I'm fine. You done plenty already. - I promise not to tell a soul you're here. Right Emma. - A while back, Emma she come to me, and she say her mama can't come here because she got the cancer. But I know Field Pea never leave us. She always come back. So I told Emma we have to take care of this grove till you mama come home. And sure enough, here she is. A good friend never leaves you. - All right, wait. Emma. - Hmm? - Our Emma. Our mother Emma Barnsdow. - Mm-mm. - And Emma's mother was Field Pea. - Of course, that's only a nickname. Field Pea proper name Edith. - Edith. (laughs) Oh my gosh. That's Edith Simpkins. That's your great grandmother. - You saying our mother let you live out there without telling anyone. - Oh, I made her promise. I couldn't have that sheriff and my husband finding me. Then, a couple of years back, Emma she come to me and she say she tired of fooling with the place, and she want me to have it, while I'm waiting on Field Pea and my boy. That's when she give it to me. - What? - [Wanda] She gave it to you. - Sure did. She gave me the papers and everything. She's a sweet little thing. She still comes out every season help me with the harvesting. We're gonna have a good one this year, huh, Field Pea. - We sure are. - It's all gone be Henry's someday. This money I done saved from selling these pecans, and the land, I'm gone give it all to him when he get here. - So that's why it wasn't in the will. Mother had already given it away. - I still got them papers. We can go get them if you want me to. - It's okay just lay down. - Wanda. I just wanted to say goodbye. Gina and I will be leaving in the morning. - Oh. - I'm sorry I put you through all this. Jimmy White and that buyer aren't too happy with me either. I guess, I just wasted everybody's time. - Well, I wouldn't call it a waste of time, Sarah. I mean maybe you didn't notice but, for the first time your daughter has opened up to someone. Gina just loves Mrs. Cooper. Do you know why? Because Mrs. Cooper is the only person that will take the time to talk with her and share with her. You daughter needs you, Sarah. - Yeah, I know. I have missed out on a lot these last few years, haven't I? I meant to come home for mother. I really did. - Well, you should have. Goodnight, Sarah. - I couldn't. I couldn't because mother was right. - What are you talking about? She hated everything about my life when I left here, my career, my husband. - She was afraid that Jerry would take you away from her. She didn't hate him. - He's in terrible trouble. When mother was dying, Jerry was indicted on fraud charges. - Indicted. - Now he's in jail. One of his investors found evidence that he may have embezzled some money from one of his real estate deals a few years back. I have spent every last nickel trying to keep him out of jail. Now I can't even raise money for bail. (sobbing) That's why I wanted to sell the pecan grove. - Sarah, I had no idea. - I wanted to help mother. I wanted to send money. But everything we own is in the process of being repossess. I'm so scared, Wanda. I don't know what to do. - Why didn't you say something? (Sarah sighs) - I was too proud. I know that sounds stupid. It sounds so silly now. The worse part is how I let you down. (gentle music) (door thuds) (birds chirping) (rooster crowing in distance) Gina. I told you, you can stay. Your father's hearing doesn't start for two weeks, and Wanda said you could stay with her till school starts. You can be with Mrs. Cooper. - You could've told me. Did you think I couldn't handle it? (telephone ringing) - [Wanda] We're not home right now. But please leave a message. - [Henry] This is Henry Cooper Junior. I got a message that you were looking for me regarding my mother. I apologize for not getting back to you sooner. - Gina. - But, I've been working out on the river. So I'm home now. I should be home the next few days. - Don't hang up! - Hello. Hello. - [Sarah] Yeah, hello this is Sarah Weatherby. - Who? - I'm Wanda's sister. Oh, god, this is gonna sound crazy, but my sister and my daughter have been looking for you. They think they found your mother. - They did. - [Sarah] Lily Cooper from Alabama, is that right? - Yeah. - And, she started telling us all about you and how she's been looking for you. But she didn't know where to find you. - Well, I figured she was insane (dramatic music) or dead I didn't know which. - Oh, no, no, no, she's not crazy. She's just a very sweet woman, and you're all she talks about. She desperately would like to see you. You just mean everything to her really. - You kidding me, right? - No, she needs you. - Then she should have stuck around for me. - She couldn't find you. The sheriff took you away from her. She just-- - Ma'am. Ma'am, I appreciate the call. But... Thanks. Thanks anyway. (somber music) (sighs sharply) - Who was that? - Some woman from South Carolina. She says they found my mother. (people chattering) (telephone rings in distance) - Irma, where's Mrs. Cooper did they move her? - Yeah, they took her upstairs to CCU last night. - To coronary. - Yeah. - Any idea how long her blood pressure's gone untreated like this? - Oh, well, forever I guess. What's wrong? - Well, her confusions caused by hardening of the arteries in the brain. Her heart's so weak, we'll be lucky if she responds to medication. - If she responds? - Well, do the best we can, Wanda, all right? - Yeah, okay. (Wanda sighs) - (sighs) If only her son would come. Maybe he could help her. - Yeah, but we knew he might not sweetheart and we have to respect his decision. - Can we at least tell Mrs. Cooper that he's still alive? Maybe that'll help her just to know. - I think it would just break her heart if she couldn't see him. She's sad enough not being in the pecan grove. - She's right honey. Look maybe we should stop and see her on the way to Atlanta. Could you give us a call if anything happens? You know we could always drive back if we have to. - All right. - Bye, Aunt Wanda. - Bye, Gina. (people chattering) (elevator chimes) (telephone rings in distance) - Gina, would you mind if I, had a moment with Mrs. Cooper by myself? - No, go ahead. Go ahead. - Thanks. (machine beeping) (dramatic music) Mrs. Cooper. I just wanna say I'm sorry for the way I acted. I didn't mean anything against you. - I know sweetheart. You was fighting yourself not me. Did they find him? Did they find my Henry? - No, not yet. But he's okay. I know he is. - I was just too scared to go back and get him. - Well, you couldn't. That wasn't your fault. But I'm sure he would love you if he could only know you. - It wasn't meant to be I guess. - You have loved him so much for so long. You think he'd know. It's too bad we can't always feel the love around us. - You're a good girl. You a real good girl. (dramatic music) - Gina. Gina, come on, let's go. - What happened? - We got some business to take care of. Come on. (birds chirping) (dog barking) - Hi. - How you doing? Can we help you? - I hope so. We're the ones who called about your mother. My name's Sarah Weatherby, and this is my daughter Gina. - I mean I knew my dad, and the sheriff had some shady stuff going on. But, I never know what had become of my mama. - You got the same eyes and the same smile. All these cats there's so much you have in common. - I'm sorry. I just can't. - (sighs) She adores you Henry. Why don't you come up and see her? - I'm glad to know she's doing all right. But I spent so many years trying to forget about her. I don't know if I could make room for her now. - But she needs you, Henry, really she does. You could ride up with us. - Do you know what it's like growing up feeling like your mama doesn't love you? That she's abandoned you. I can remember as a little boy just hoping every day that my mama would come and find me. Then after a while you start to think, "Well, what is wrong with me? "I mean what did I do so terrible? "My own mama won't try and find me." - She did. She wrote you a letter every day after that sheriff put her in that hospital. She saved everything she had so she could send for you. She was afraid to go back. That's why she couldn't find you. Please come, Mr. Copper. - She really loves you, Henry. Don't miss a chance to let her know how much you love her too. - No, kidding. - Yeah, you should've seen her. She talked him into it. Mother talked him into it. Aunt Wanda he's got cats all over the place. Tell, Mrs. Cooper we're gonna be there okay. - Gina, wait. Listen. (Wanda sighs) I've been trying to call you. You know, she's not doing too well. - [Sarah] It's really too hot for coffee. Don't you think? - What? - Mrs. Cooper she just might not make it till tomorrow. - No. Wanda, you gotta tell her. You gotta make her wait. Tell her that Field Pea asked her too. - I'm gonna try, sweetheart. But listen you better just get here as fast as you can. All right we'll see you soon. (fax machine buzzing) (people chattering) (machine beeps) Hey, Irma. Mrs. Cooper. - Hmm? - Mrs. Cooper. - Mm. - Hey. I have some good news for you. - Hmm? (gentle music) - That is Henry? - Uh-huh. - You found my Henry. (gentle music) - He's coming to see you. You'd like that, wouldn't you? - Look at my baby. - (laughs) Yes. - All my life. My baby's all right. Look at him. Thank you. Thank you. (gentle music) To my darling Henry, I don't know if I'll still be here when you come to see me. (birds chirping) - Wanda. Sorry. - What's, what's happening. - She started having chest pains during the night, so we're taking her for an angiogram. It's possible she may need an emergency bypass. - And what are her chances? - We could lose her. - No, Bill you can't. - The heart teams ready, Wanda, we gotta move. - Can I just go see her? - For a minute. - Thank you. - Move your hand for me, dear. Let me take that okay. - Irma. Irma, let her keep it. It's all right. Hey, Mrs. Cooper. Now listen Henry's coming. You wanna see him don't you? - Mm-mm. - All right. - That little bitty baby made this great big man. I ain't going nowhere, baby. - Listen we gotta get her ready. - Okay. See you later. Billy, can't you wait a little longer? - We need to get her started, Wanda. (people chattering in distance) - Wanda. Wanda. He's here. (dramatic music) - Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. He's here. Mrs. Cooper, your son is here. - Henry. - Mm-hmm. Henry. Henry. Oh, praise the Lord. Henry. Henry. - Hey, mama. - Henry. - Hey, mama. - Henry. - Hey mama. (heavy sobbing) - Did he take care of you? - Yes, ma'am he sure did? - Did he feed you right? (heavy sobbing) (bright music) They got you working on the boat now. You know how to swim, don't you? - Yeah, mama, I can swim I can swim. - That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. That's good. - We gotta take her now, sir. - I better let you go, mama. I'll talk you in a little while you hear. I missed you, mama. (tender music) I missed you. (heavy sobbing) - [Lilly] That's my baby. That's my baby. That's my baby. That's my baby. That's my baby. That's my baby. (door creaks) (people chattering in distance) (door creaks) - Wanda, I'm sorry. She couldn't hang on. - No, no she can't. (dramatic music) - I'm very sorry. (dramatic music) (heavy sobbing) (insects chittering) (birds chirping) (somber music) - Should've known y'all would be with her. (gentle music) (cats mewing) - Gina. - Why couldn't she wait just a little longer? - Oh, honey. She waited almost 50 years. I wish I could've been a good friend to her like you were. You cared about her when no one else would. You believed in her. You know, wherever she is, she's never gonna forget that ever. We thought we were hearing about her story. She was really talking about all of us too. (gentle music) Things will be pretty tough for a while, honey. I'm gone need your help. - We can do it, mama. (tender music) (bird squawks) - Oh, baby. - While I couldn't hold you or touch you or lift your spirits with a smile, I can only hope that you will someday know how much I have loved you. With all my love your mother, Lilly Cooper. So, they were all for me, huh? - Every last one of them. - I can't thank you all enough for what you've done for me. You've given me something that, I never thought that I'd have. (Henry sighs) I wouldn't dream of taking this place away from you all. It's part of your family, and I want the both of you to have it. - Henry, are you sure? - Yes. - Thank you. - Thank you. (Wanda sighs) - We gone go for the last shot, huh? - Actually, I want you to have this. - [Henry] I couldn't do that. - [Gina] Maybe you'll get to know her now. (gentle music) - Thank you. I appreciate it. - Henry, don't wanna miss that plane. - Okay. - Henry, I hope we see you and Evelyn again sometime. Maybe Thanksgiving. - We'd like that. - All right. - [Henry] We'd like that very much. - Fly safely now, okay? - Okay. Thanks. (dramatic music) (pensive music) - I have an idea. Now that it's ours again, why don't we get the place running. - What are you kidding me? - No, really. Clean out this part over here and put in some storage sheds. Use this area over here for shelling of the pecans, and we'll use the money we make to fix up the place. (Wanda laughs) What do you think? - Would mother would be surprised at you. - Oh, I know. Papa too. (bright music) (birds chirping) (gentle music) (bright music)
