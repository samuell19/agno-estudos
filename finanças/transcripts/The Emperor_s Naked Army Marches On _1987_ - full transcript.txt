A Shisso Production To Kill Ex-Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka Kobe City, Hyogo Kenzo Okuzaki, 62 Shizumi, 64, his wife Yabu, Hyogo This is the wedding of Mr. Otagaki and Miss Sano. My name is Okuzaki and I'm delighted to act as go-between. Mr. Otagaki and Miss Sano, congratulations. After graduating from Kobe University... The groom fought the Establishment... He was subsequently arrested. I, the go-between, killed a broker... shot a sling at Emperor Hirohito... then scattered obscene flyers denouncing him. I served 13 years and 9 months in solitary confinement. Three convictions for accounts of murder, assault, and obscenity. This match was made possible because the groom and I... both fought against the Establishment. This is a rare wedding. For many of you, this country might mean a lot, but... judging from my experience, not only Japan but any other countries... Nation is a wall between men. It's a big wall that prevents us from joining together. I also consider family a wall. It isolates human beings from each other and cuts ties. In other words, it's against the divine law. So I intend to continue attacking it. Happy wedding! CONVICTIONS Murder of a real estate broker. 10 years at hard labor. Shooting of a sling at the Emperor in the palace. 1 year and 6 months at hard labor Scattering flyers with pornographic images of the Emperor 1 year and 2 months at hard labor Plotting to murder the former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka Not indicted THE EMPEROR'S NAKED ARMY MARCHES ON - Hyogo Police Station. - Kashimoto chief, please. Speaking. - This is Okuzaki calling. - Oh, hello. Thanks for calling again. I was out. Thank you for your visit. I dropped by the other day, but you were sick? I haven't recovered yet. And your wife had a cold, too. She still does. Take care. I'm thinking of going to Tokyo. For what? Chief of Surveillance, Hyogo police Taking medicine? Are you allergic? No medicine for me. It's tough. Well... am I clear to go? You're not planning to drive that van with a billboard? Not in Tokyo. Take a train. I'll do what I have to do. And you do what you have to do. - Is your van ready to go? - Yes. We'll accompany you halfway. You would've found out one way or the other. You wouldn't like that. I'm glad you called. I had to judge as a chief. Fukaya City, Saitama Excuse me. Mr. Kichitaro Yamada's room? Room 13? Ex-Sergeant Kichitaro Yamada, The 36th Regiment You don't look well. - When will you be released? - In three weeks. I must stay in bed for at least 10 days. Got an operation. The last one? They sewed me up. If it's not infected. This is the 6th time. No more operations? If nothing happens. I'm writing to the Indonesian president... requesting permission to visit West New Guinea. He can't read Japanese, so... I had it translated into Indonesian. When you get better... unless the doctor stops you... we should go if your physical condition allows you to. It's an important gesture that we go there for a memorial service... despite our financial and physical difficulties. When I was in prison, I heard you got hospitalized. I wrote to you saying that it was a divine punishment. What I really meant was... ...how shall I say? I think it was the result of your post-war life. You deserved hospitalization. You may be a perfectly good citizen. But look at the state you're in. People like you who experienced the war the way you did... shall not be allowed to live in peace like nothing happened. For me, that is unforgivable. April 29, 1982 Emperor's Birthday I, Kenzo Okuzaki, am conducting a memorial service here... to console the souls of the many victims who perished... for the Emperor Hirohito during the Pacific War. Officers! The police commissioners' henchmen! Under the name of law, you can destroy my wagon... or arrest me at your own accord. Now... Can you hear me? Kenzo Okuzaki is here on the Emperor's Birthday... to console the countless souls who were victimized by... the 81 year old Hirohito and his associates! I'm conducting a memorial service for their souls. I belonged to the 36th Regiment. In New Guinea, almost all of us starved to death. What kind of man is a great man? The rich? The emperor? The president? The pope? By my interpretation... A man who observes God's law, not man's law, and acts honorably and does the right thing... without fear of being punished. That's what I call a great man. A police officer is showing me a note. They're forcing me to obey their law. I may be powerless, but I believe with an absolute conviction... that I couldn't be more right than any officers and officials. All so called officials, the police officers and the judges... obey Communist laws... if Japan is ruled by the communists. The police officers and the judges all work for money. I don't get paid for doing this, like those right wing people. Not a penny. Sometimes people offered. But I've never asked. They just want to talk. We'll be back soon. So please stop. See you. Bar Association I've suffered from the law more than anybody else. The one who took the most advantage among Japanese... Makoto Endo A chief lawyer in 'Teigin Incident' is the Emperor Hirohito... who is a symbol of ignorance, irresponsibility, and impossibility. I shot 4 lead pellets at the Emperor with a sling, scattered pornographic flyers with images of the Emperor... in Ginza, Shibuya, and Shinjuku. I was indicted in both cases. There were two judges and eight prosecutors involved. I pissed and spat on them. Then I called them names. The building next door... is the Tokyo Supreme Court. There I yelled at the judge with handcuffs on, "you don't deserve to sit in the chair." "Get down on your knees!" I was removed from the court. Then in the afternoon... the trial resumed. This time I said... "Dig a hole and bury yourself!" I spent 13 years and 9 months in jail. I'm not afraid. I take responsibility. I want the chief. Says who? Get permission. No camera! No camera! Okuzaki visits Kobe Prison to take a measurement for a cell... so he can build it in his own house. - We're not threatening you. - I think you are! You stay behind. Keep out! Go away! Kobe Prison Make way! You want to stop me? I dare you to do something. Have anything to say? Well, do you? I dare you to do something. You guys are robots! You aren't human! None of you are! Just like the Emperor Hirohito! You just take orders and obey. Go ahead and do something. I dare you. Dogs. If you're human, get angry. You can't, can you? Get out of there! Get out! Damn you! Get out! Etajima, Hiroshima I'm Kenzo Okuzaki. Mr. Shimamoto and I were friends in New Guinea. We were the same rank, him and me. He died in West New Guinea. A place called Arso. Iseko Shimamoto, 77 We were in the same unit. So we dug a hole and buried his body. We picked green papayas and placed them on his grave. And we held a ceremony. Private Masayuki Shimamoto But he is the only one who got a proper burial. We didn't bury the other soldiers. Only Mr. Shimamoto got buried. In that sense, he was lucky. But the others... Thank you. Unfortunately he died, but he was the luckiest one. At least, I think so. So I came to console his soul in my way. That your house? - And the grave? - Here. This one? It's very nice. No graves like this in my town. It's a fine grave. None like this in my hometown. Your mother has Come to the pier Again today like any other day Expecting your return from the war Floating Clouds.... - Oh, I messed up. - It's OK. Sing again from the start. It's OK. Your mother has Come to the pier Again today like any other day Although I know you might be gone Somewhere on the faraway battleground, If you're alive, you might be alive, You may be on the ship to homeland Don't you want to go to New Guinea? But the money... Forget about money. It's not a matter of money. Do you want to go? I do, but I can't. Even if you have money, you can't go if you're sick. So I'll take care of you for your late son. Let's go to New Guinea. I'm glad. Hamasaka, Hyogo Private Yamazaki died of starvation in New Guinea. "Soldier of the God's Army" "In Consolation of Private Yamazaki's Soul" Nantan, Hyogo "In Consolation of Sergeant Tanaka's Soul" Tanaka was shot with a poisonous arrow and went mad. The 36th Regiment garrison leader shot some of his men. The 36th Regiment garrison leader shot some of his men. Yagake, Okayama To find out the truth, Okuzaki visits the man who led the unit. It's been a long time. I'm Okuzaki. Mr. Takami? It's been 38 years. It's hard to recognize you. How are you? Are you sick? I apologize for my sudden visit. When did you come home? In 1952? I'm sorry. I came abruptly. I'm sorry. Can we talk here? I understand. That's right. So I'll explain it. You should have let me know. Yes, I should have. I'm sorry. Really sorry. I know why you are here. Excuse me. Forgive me about this, Mr. Takami. We don't have any control over our fate. Ex-Sergeant Minoru Takami Our fate has brought us here together today. We have no control. It's not like we were accomplices. We were young and the war was on. Welcome. I'm sorry I came abruptly. You have a son. You still live with him? Please. - My compliments. - Please don't bother. I should have brought something nicer. Please take it. You once told me that Koshimizu shot his men. Can you tell me more? Ask the man in Kobe. Ask him. - The medic? - Yes. Were you present when Koshimizu shot Private Yoshizawa? Or you heard it from somebody else? I heard it from someone. You didn't see it with your own eyes? No. I don't know. I only heard it. I was a POW for a year. A year before the war ended, I beat up Sergeant Hashimoto. I beat up the lieutenant. Resistance helped me survive. I can beat up Koshimizu, no problem. Many men wanted to avenge their leaders after they came back. But they didn't because they would be arrested. Koshimizu can count on me to beat him up good. Hello. Welcome. Our grandchild. Nice to meet you. Make yourself at home. Thank you. To your health. - Take care. - You too. Thank you. Keep well. Kenzo Okuzaki promises, from here on in, to live life... in the way a man should. I have many more things to do. That's why I can stay healthy. I must do more. If not, I'd be finished. Hakuta, Shimane Excuse me. What I heard... is that you were present when Yoshizawa was executed... or murdered. Captain Koshimizu shot Private Yoshizawa. That's a fact. I need an eyewitness. I wasn't there. Wasn't he a deserter? Did Koshimizu shoot him in your presence? Did he? It was so long ago. Koshimizu didn't do it by himself. It was a military order. It was an order? Orders always came first. And reports were accepted without questions. - So there was an order. - I believe so. Whose order? His superiors. So there must be an official record of that order, correct? Ex-Sergeant Yukio Seo Did you see Koshimizu shoot Yoshizawa? With your own eyes? It wasn't his own doing. He had taken proper steps to execute him. Is that so? Koshimizu didn't do it out of a grudge or anything. That's not what I'm asking. - The order was given to him. - It was an order? We didn't know if we could survive. You're saying the execution occurred off the base? We were in a jungle and we could have died any day. I can't really tell you everything that happened. I'm busy today. I must go. I was a member of the 36th Regiment. I'm talking to you. Come here! Answer me! Damn you! How dare you! We were in the same Regiment! Shall I call the police? Don't! Stop! Please! Answer me! I don't know you. - I gave you my card. - Who cares! What are you talking about? Stop it! Call the cops! I even shot at the Emperor. - No violence. - You don't know violence! You deserve it! I called the police. Let the cops come! No violence! No violence! - Take a picture. - We're shooting this! You insulted me. Why hit me? No violence, please! Your attitude! Who the hell are you? I said my name. - What? - I told you my name! But I don't know you. There's more proper ways to introduce yourself. You wouldn't listen. It might be OK for you, but this is not the right way. I'm Kenzo Okuzaki. I still don't know you. Bring Koshimizu's letter or something. Get the cops! Don't hit him! Help! What's going on? I didn't hit so hard! This is unlawful entry! This is between me and him! - I told you I didn't hit so hard! - So what? Intruder! Stop it! I said, stop filming! I'm getting beat up. Please tell me how Private Yoshizawa died. He was executed. Yoshizawa's Sister, Rinko Sakimoto He was in their way. There's an obstacle here. Unless you remove it, the jaws won't shut tight. So you have to get rid of this. This hard thing... You must get rid of it. Then, the upper and lower jaws can shut properly like this. And everyone is happy. You see? I think all his buddies knew. They knew. Captain Koshimizu must know exactly what happened. I prayed at the altar yesterday... asking him to tell me how he died. Private Tetsunosuke Yoshizawa I chanted the sutra and prayed very hard. Then I thought his face moved. His face in the photo moved. Setagaya, Tokyo There was another soldier who was executed. - Private Jinpei Nomura - I should have contacted you first. - Jinpei's Brother, Toshiya Nomura - That would be the proper way. But if I had, you'd have refused to see us. That is why we decided to visit you like this. The execution ground couldn't have been very far. We couldn't go anywhere near it, you know. - Ex-Corporal Riichi Aikawa - We didn't know what was going on. - Was Hara among the executioners? - Yes. There were six of them. Who were they? The ones you can identify. All from the 36th Regiment? Hara, and who else? I don't know the two of them. Who are the others? They were... Hara, we know. Seo... What? Seo who? Yukio. The man you hit. Him? He said he had nothing to do with it. A man named Kojima... I don't know where he lives. - He came back? - Kojima shot, too? So the six are Kojima... Hara, Seo... Takami, Inaba, and Kojima. I'm suspecting my brother and Mr. Nomura... did something they didn't want other people to know. So they were executed under a false charge. No. When did it happen? Before the war ended? Yes, but I don't know exactly when. The units were separated. But it was a shocking incident. But we didn't know why or what happened at the time. Only the unit members knew where they went. But the army knew, so they were executed. Their desertion was discovered. So they got executed. If it hadn't been discovered, there would be no execution. At least Koshimizu knew. I suppose. He was a captain. I heard Nomura fell ill in a village. He became unconscious, but the enemy was coming. The doctor had to leave him behind. Then why was he executed later? I don't know why these two were executed together. Isawa, Yamanashi Insurance Center Ex-Sergeant Toshio Hara Well, let's see. Let's go to my room. Please. Were you one of the six executioners? Aikawa said so. That I can't tell you. Yes, you can. There is no way. Nomura and Yoshizawa were men I cared about the most. I can tell you that I have nothing to hide. But for the sake of these souls... We shouldn't dig up the past. We can't do that. My memories have faded after many years. You know what happened. Look at my eyes. I have nothing to hide. You're saying Aikawa lied? Listen. When we met at the funeral, I asked you about my brother. I thought it was strange that he died after the war was over. You said the news of the truce reached you three days later. Finally, you could build a fire. So you cremated my brother, and brought home his ashes. You were in tears and asked me to bury the ashes. That's how we parted. The execution took place 23 days after the war ended. You were one of the executioners, were you not? I don't know. You don't know? It's either "yes" or "no." What kind of an answer is that? Tell us. I can see that the incident still bothers your conscience. Look at this picture. But... Tell us the truth. I won't be surprised. I hit Yukio Seo, not knowing he was one of the six men. Hitting him wasn't my intention for the visit. But he refused to talk, so I hit him. Today, I came here prepared to beat you up. I mean it. No one else beat officers more than I did. You brought back my brother's ashes and cried. I'd rather not do this to you. So tell us the truth. I don't like to be violent. What was the charge? One thing I want to tell you... is that your siblings did nothing wrong. - My brother? - That's right. That I can tell you, but nothing else. So is it also true that you brought back his ashes? If you can say that much, please tell us everything. Tell us. Please, Mr. Hara. Be kind to us. You said Mr. Yoshizawa and Mr. Nomura... They did nothing wrong. Nothing at all. It's been 40 years since the war ended. Why do you want to disturb the dead by talking about this? Hell with that! We came here to console their souls. My brother appears in my dream. I see him at the altar, too. They are not in peace. - They visit every day. - Every night. Did Koshimizu order you to shoot two of your men? Are you one of the executioners? I can't say. You said they didn't do anything. - That's correct. - You sure? Believe me. I don't want you to think they did something wrong. You act as if they did. It's strange. - No. - Very odd. Did they know the war had ended when they were executed? I think so. They knew the war was over. You said you learned 3 days after it ended. You thought you could return to Japan. We found out on the 18th. Were you not present at the execution? By order of Koshimizu? Didn't you see them fall? I won't leave until you tell us. I'll follow you to your house. I won't let you leave this room, even if it's illegal. I don't give a damn. I shot at the Emperor whom we'd worshiped. It was impossible for us to shoot at him. But I did and my business tripled. People respected me for it. You may want to go home. But the two soldiers can never return home from New Guinea. Let them in. Do as I tell you. Not an order, but... Police? Come in. You too. Come in. Sit down here. You may arrest me. Come in. Who are you? You should learn more about life and war. This is a real story. How do you do? The police in this town? Please move for the camera. We came to shoot. I'm Ito. Prefectural police? Sugaue from Isawa Precinct. I'm sorry I came abruptly. Will you tell us your plan? That's not important. I came here concerning these people. His brother and hers - the two of them. Someone at this facility was concerned for Mr. Hara. That's why they called you. So they called you to arrest me for confining him. Am I confining him? My late father believed his son died in honor. He wants to know the truth, too. Please tell us the truth. Let's go. Will you come with me? - Where to? - OK with me. How about you? If you tell us the whole truth. Just you two. All the truth? Why can't you talk here? I'll explain later. You're only trying to fool them. These two are entitled to know the truth. You won't tell the truth. Let's go. Why tell them alone? If you aren't guilty, you can tell us. Let's go. I don't want to make you wait. - Tell us in front of the camera. - I won't. No way. We'll wait until you do. If you weren't guilty, you can tell anybody. I could tell these two, but no one else. My brother's here. His spirit. Consider he's here. And speak for him. They can't talk. They were innocent, but executed. What was the charge? - Desertion? - Yes. - That's it. - When? When? I don't remember. It was a serious matter. Did they leave to get food, and never returned? If people find out they were executed for desertion, you'd have to bear the shame as family members. The camera is rolling. How do you think people who see the film will interpret this? They'll think you're hiding the truth. No need to worry about that. I didn't want to tell you because you would suffer more. I don't want that to happen. I don't believe such charges. Your brothers were deserters. That is why they were shot. That's a shame. But you denied that they were deserters. People today don't consider it a shame. I don't feel guilty toward you two. I understand. Your late brothers know the truth. It was pure luck that my gun didn't go off. Was it loaded? The powder was wet. Usually 3 out of 10 shots were no good. - The gun didn't go off. - The bullet was no good? I thought God helped me. Did you pull the trigger? How many times? Once? I think so. We all fired once. Many of us. - With rifles? - That's right. I see. Thanks. That's enough. I didn't want you to be disappointed by this fact. I just don't want that. I'm not disappointed at all. His death is, but not the truth. It was well within their rights to run for their own lives. The Japanese Army had no right to execute them. Nagata, Kobe City Nagata, Kobe City I'll compensate for the loss of business, if necessary. This is important. Please! Not now! Are you the son-in-law? Not here. If we can talk to him, we can go somewhere else. - Yes. Please do that. - Grandpa. Business is important. But these people lost their brothers. Why can't you spare some time? - But we're busy. - Yes, I know. You can call the police if you want to arrest me. But business is important. Losing one's brother is more important. We need to earn a living. We'll talk somewhere else. His back is hurting. It's better than being dead. These people... what is his name? Hamaguchi? Ex-Medic Masaichi Hamaguchi You were a medic. If you want the police, I'll call them for you. I already told the police. I'm sorry about your back, but... Their brothers lost their lives. Get the dish. I thought his back was hurting. We're expecting customers any minute now. - We're important guests, too. - What? This is how we make a living. What a hassle! What hassle? You just want money. What hassle?! All you want is money! These people lost their brothers. Making money is more important? I don't make money doing this. While you travel around the world for fun... Let's go. What?! They're working here. Then go. You and Koshimizu committed a murder. There's no place big enough for all of us. We'll find it. - How about a park? - It's too cold. Just follow me. You didn't pull the trigger? No. - Do you remember you didn't? - Of course. You have a good memory, so you remember the ones who did. An incident like this doesn't happen often. But it happened 40 years ago. Even if you don't remember about yesterday, you can't forget murders. When we heard the war ended, we were so happy we wanted to clap, but the captain was near us. So we whispered to each other. We held hands and we were really glad it was over. A few days later, hearing the war was over, Yoshizawa and Nomura returned together. Nomura was suffering from malnutrition and malaria. He was unconscious and I tended to him every day. He was in critical condition. He went to the command post to locate his unit. He got lost. There he met Yoshizawa. They were the same rank, no? They stayed there for a few days. But they had no food. They knew they were going to die. They wanted to die with full stomachs at least, so they ran. We only had a few days to live. We were completely surrounded. There were thousands of us in an area within a 2km radius. We were ordered to fight till we died. So they wanted to eat plenty before they died. They left the command post. The two of them together. But the officers... wanted the deserters from the Regiment caught and executed. The order was given. If it was during the war... they would have been shot. For sure. But the war was over. Then the order came. The end of the war changed everything. But they carried out the order. Koshimizu must regret that. - The command staff ordered it? - Yes. Not Koshimizu? No. The command staff. Were they court-martialed? Not in that situation. Then it was obviously a murder. I heard they were reported as killed in action. I was told he died in the hospital. At the joint funeral, I said to Hara, "that's very strange." I was told he was wounded and died on September 8th. But the war was over then. It ended on August 15. They learned three days later. How could that have happened? Hara cried and said, "ask no more." But I wasn't convinced. Another possible reason for the execution... It's difficult to bring this up, but... It was a cover up for cannibalism. You had to shut their mouths. No. That's not the case. Privates were the first victims... to put it bluntly... They were eaten. Eaten? I mean cannibalized. For the others to survive. In fact, we all did it. I didn't hear Yoshizawa... in particular ate it. We all ate meat. White or black. We all did. If neither was available, privates were the first to go. No, not one of us. You think it's hard to talk about this in times of peace. But it was a time of war then. There were many deserters. But they couldn't find food. I heard they cannibalized each other and got caught later. They cut the flesh off shoulders and buttocks... and ate them? To the bone, then hung from trees. That was the lowest of human behavior. We didn't eat any Japanese soldiers. I'm sure. They called human flesh "pork?" - We called them "pigs." - Is that right? - "Black pigs" for... - Natives? "White pigs" for white men and Japanese soldiers? Not Japanese soldiers. I don't know. You ate them. And Koshimizu, too. If it was served as pork, anyone would eat it. If you bring an arm, anyone would know. There were no hogs. I heard they did. In the earlier days. - All the "pigs" were human? - I suppose. - I see. So you hunt for "pigs?" - We once did get a wild hog. But you had no strength. If we got the natives' hogs, they would kill us. There were so many bodies... left to rot along the road in rows, bloated and purple. - These are Japanese soldiers? - Yes. Our brothers jeopardized Koshimizu's safe return to Japan. They were in the way. - No, no... - They would talk. They ate human flesh. But my brother protested. He was against cannibalism. So Koshimizu and them wanted to get rid of him. That's what I was told. - Who said so? - My brother and God. How many times did they pull the trigger, once, twice? Once, I think. I was told you took care of the bodies and buried my brother. Can you describe the state of his corpse? I'm sure his body was covered with blood and everything. He was leaning forward? Was he riddled with bullets? There were six of them. I don't know who fired and who didn't. They did get shot and fell. That was enough. - How many bullets? - I don't know. We covered the wounds, but we had no bandage. Then, we buried them. How did you bury them? Two holes had been dug in front of them. You didn't pull the trigger? I didn't. You didn't? Some say you did. - Who? - Someone. If I did, I'd have suffered more. I wouldn't have been able to see you. Sumoto City, Hyogo You look like Nomura. He was a tall man. Taller than me. Yoshizawa... I don't remember. Ex-Doctor Taro Maruyama I don't remember too well. When I asked for their pardon, I think he said it had to be done. - He said it was an order. - Koshimizu? Col. Koizumi's order? If I remember correctly, he said he got the order. There's an ex-sergeant named Minoru Takami. I remember. He changed his name. He was my chief. We got transferred to New Guinea. Koshimizu ordered him to shoot. Disobedience meant death. So he shot, but to miss. After they shot the two men, Koshimizu drew his gun and shot them again. Like a samurai decapitating another who has committed harakiri... to release their pain. That's what Takami told me. It's difficult to say, but I think Koshimizu was to blame. He gave a signal to shoot? Yes. If he hadn't, no one would have shot. This is my brother's grave, but we don't know if the ashes were his. We didn't even open the urn. My father forbade me to open it. When I got the urn, I was told that it might be empty. So I shouldn't open it. They all say different things. Not the same story, so someone is lying. Our brothers were executed for something they didn't do. They were killed because... the officers wanted to cannibalize them to survive. I think so. Privates were the first to be sacrificed for officers. They had to stay within four square kilos. They didn't have any food. So the easiest way was to prey on low-ranking soldiers. The weakest fell victim first. And the officers survived that way. The two never accompanied Okuzaki again. Voice on the telephone Ex-Sergeant Shichiro Kojima Voice on the telephone Ex-Sergeant Shichiro Kojima You know Koshimizu executed two men in New Guinea. - He's still alive? - Oh, yes. Alive and well. I thought he was killed by now. Really? By whom? Because he... shot his men. He pulled the trigger. He killed his men? Since the war was over, no one should be punished for desertion. So no execution. That's what I thought. But Koshimizu insisted that it was an order. So he killed them. The victim's brother and sister, Mr. Nomura and Ms. Sakimoto... accompanied me so far. But if I may say so myself... they are not committed enough to see this through. I tried very hard to convince Mr. Nomura... but we couldn't see eye to eye. So I don't want to visit Koshimizu with them. So I asked you, Mr. Kuwata, to act as Hiroshi Nomura. A brother of the victim, Jinpei Nomura. Thank you. And, my dear... you'll be acting, not as my wife, but as Yoshizawa's sister. Do your best, but let me do the talking. Visiting Koshimizu's House Ohtake City, Hiroshima On March 28, 1944, we left Wewak, New Guinea. I was a member of the 36th Regiment. And you were the captain. My name is Kenzo Okuzaki. Here are the relatives of the two soldiers... who were executed and shot by your order. Mr. Yoshizawa's sister and Mr. Nomura's brother here. Masao Muramoto (former Koshimizu), Leader of Wewak Garrison Mr. Hiroshi Nomura and... Mrs. Shizuko Ishiji. I asked them to come here. A good friend of mine, Makoto Endo, is a lawyer in Tokyo. I inquired of him about your conduct. He confirms that if you had executed them without a trial... even by contemporary law... there is no question that your action was a murder. The six men who shot them by your order... should also be held responsible for an illegal execution. The contemporary law gives you the benefit of prescription. So you're free from penal responsibility or civil liabilities. But you can't escape God's judgment and I think... you're still guilty. I don't... The victims' relatives want your explanation. We reserved a place nearby so we can talk. That's not necessary. What was the colonel's order? He told you the reason for execution. They cannibalized the natives. That was the charge. So they were executed for an inhuman and unforgivable act. We couldn't eat white pigs, but black pigs were OK to eat. You mean the natives? White pigs were for white men, right? It was an order, so I heard. An official order? Yes. I heard there was an order like that. So you could eat black pigs, but not white pigs. The situation was that bad. When you executed your men, did you not ask them about the charges yourself? You didn't bother? No, I couldn't. I didn't see them. I didn't see the execution. I don't know. - You didn't? - No, I didn't. When I returned, I got the order from the colonel. We had to execute them. The men had not come back at the time. Neither of them. I didn't see them. Ex-Sergeant Takami said you ordered him to fire. And then afterwards... It was my order, so if you say I killed them, I can't deny it. I wouldn't say I had nothing to do with their death. But Takami is wrong and I must say he lied to you. He said you shot them with a gun. No. I had no hand gun then. You weren't there at the execution? No. I didn't know. I mean I didn't see it. You weren't there, but someone else ordered to shoot. Someone did obey your order and carried it out? That's correct. I confirmed that Dr. Maruyama and Medic Hamaguchi were there. Yes, I think Sergeant Hamaguchi was there. Did he pull the trigger? I don't know who shot them. I did order a few people to execute the two men. After the so called execution... did you see the bodies of Nomura and Yoshizawa? Before the men returned, the platoon moved. So I don't know where they buried the bodies. You used your men and didn't soil your own hands? "Used" is a wrong word. Otherwise Takami wouldn't have done it. Right. None of your men said good things about you. Maybe so, maybe so, but... It was my responsibility to take my men home and I did my best. Actually, some leaders escaped from the front. But I wasn't going to sacrifice others to save my own skin. When I had to do something for my men, I did it. Even if they hated me, I did what I had to do for them. You may blame me, but I'm not ashamed of myself. I still remember you very well during the war. We had a little rice for each meal. We were still getting supplies, but there was very little food. We were given very little rice. Before we ate, you made us sing Military songs. I felt very angry about that. You made us sing a silly song. What kind of a captain makes us sing song like that? I couldn't believe the nerve you had. Each time I sang, I felt a surging rage toward you. It wasn't my idea. I was ordered to. If you knew we were hungry, why did you make us sing? It was a matter of opinion. I thought it was a good thing. I understand if you blame me. Nobody likes to eat human flesh. If we have food, who wants that? But there was nothing to eat, and they were starving. They knew they were going to die. They had to resort to cannibalism. But I blame those who put them in that situation. Foreign soldiers would have never done it. They would surrender before they starve to death, right? Yes. You're right. It's unbelievable in a normal circumstance. It was a thoughtless act. When I committed a murder or when I shot at the Emperor... I didn't try to escape. I took responsibility. But you didn't. I hate irresponsible people. You didn't take responsibility for what you did. That's a matter of opinion. The most cowardly man in Japan is the Emperor Hirohito. You were one of the loyal officers. The following day, at five in the morning. The following day, at five in the morning. Hakuta, Shimane He was in charge of weapons... of the 36th Regiment, Wewak Garrison. His name is Yukio Seo. I came here in August last year... I asked you about the execution. You said you weren't there and didn't know anything. But in fact, you were one of the executioners. I'm really sorry about that. Ex-Sergeant Yukio Seo Koshimizu told me... Yoshizawa and Nomura cannibalized natives. Don't bother with tea. I can drink at home. I came to hear your story, not for tea. - The captain called me. - He asked for you. Yes. I asked what he wanted and he told me to bring guns. Five guns. Five guns? To use for execution. Five rifles? Did he say five? I think he had prepared them... by the time I was called in. And I asked why. The captain said they were deserters. Didn't he tell you they cannibalized natives? I don't know. I had just returned only a few days earlier. There you were, Yukio Seo, Minoru Takami... and a sergeant Hara... and then... Riichi Aikawa. Five men in all. Five guns, and one had a blank. You had blanks? I meant no bullet. One rifle was blank? Just one. So each could think he had the blank... to avoid feeling guilty. It was mixed with the others. One was blank. And four bullets? Four. When I arrived, it was ready. Everything had been arranged. We got the guns and we fired. - Did Koshimizu give the order? - Yes. - He was there? - Yes. How far were you from the victims? 4... 5 meters. - Blindfolded? - Yes. I aimed at the heart so he would die right away. But... they didn't die instantly. So Koshimizu shot them with his gun. That's how I remember it. Minoru Takami told me so, too. Minoru Takami, Yukio Seo, Masaichi Hamaguchi... Toshio Hara, Riichi Aikawa. I'm not sure about Aikawa. Five guns were prepared. Where was Koshimizu? Was he standing behind you? No. Beside us. Where was Dr. Maruyama? Was he there? He was beside him, I think. Beside him? Whose heart did you aim at? The middle. I was in the middle. Of the five, I mean. I aimed at the left one. Left one? - On your left? - Yes. You aimed at his heart to save him from pain? You're no longer Koshimizu's men. It was 37 years ago. During the war, you weren't his employee or anything. No. I know this is too early for a visit. This is my way of consoling the souls of the victims. I'm accusing the Emperor Hirohito for the same reason. He was in charge as the supreme commander of the lmperial Army. But he didn't assume responsibility. When I came here to see you last August, you blamed me... and said we lost the war because of soldiers like me. Everyone has a different opinion. I'm sorry. Sorry to bother you this early. Thanks for coming. 2:00 PM, the same day. Yagake, Okayama We visited Seo again... Ex-Sergeant Minoru Takami and he told us the truth this time. You must be cold. Please sit down. Your guests are waiting. Please give me a minute. He ordered you to call them. Then what? So all of us gathered for Koshimizu. With Seo... and what's his name? Hara... and others. And he made us do it. Koshimizu explained the order... and ordered you the execution in person? An order was an order. So we had to obey. Your wife seems to have a problem with us filming like this. I understand how she feels, but... Please forgive her. I understand, but does she know what this is all about? Shut up and go away! Please forgive us. With Koshimizu's order, you took a rifle... and aimed at them, correct? Right. That's how it happened. I didn't know why they had to be executed, but... we shot them. That's a fact. And you fired to miss? Are you sure? It was a short distance. Are you sure you didn't hit him? I think so. If I'd aimed, I wouldn't have missed. How far? 5 meters? The range? It was about from here to there. - Five? - Five meters. Yes. It was very close and easy to miss. So I deliberately missed. Then, they got hit and fell backward. Like this. Then Koshimizu shot them. How many times? Once each? Yes. I'm sorry for what happened. I'm sorry. I understand why Mr. Okuzaki is doing this. I'm ashamed of myself. I couldn't do anything for the victims or their families. I sincerely apologize. You were my squad leader. It's been 38 years, and now I come to you and I'm able to say... I'm a much better human being than you. I can say it to your face... because of the way I lived my life after the war. It wasn't just my own doing... but also divine will and nature's law. Many people understood and supported me, too. Please forgive our poor hospitality. My regards to your wife. Please forgive her. She showed no understanding. I'll talk some sense into her. Please forgive her. Take care of your wife. Fukaya City, Saitama Fukaya City, Saitama Eizaburo Oshima, An Anarchist Mr. Oshima here... shot a smoke bomb at the palace back in 1969... on the same day I shot a sling at Emperor Hirohito. That's how we met. Today we're going to find out the truth of the murder of a sergeant... named Giichi Hashimoto. The regiment was reduced to five men... then he was murdered by fellow soldiers. In order to find out the truth, I asked Mr. Oshima... to act as the victim's brother. A murder at Regiment Headquarters was also discovered. Happy New Year! Are you better? I'm OK. You remember Hashimoto, the officer you respected. Ex-Sergeant Kichitaro Yamada I was told that three of you drew lots and murdered him. I found out the truth about the murder at Wewak. I must find out the truth about this case, too. You said you drew lots. Doesn't that make you an accomplice to murder? Enough. I've cooperated with you before. But what is the point of digging that up again? Let me tell you something. I was the sole survivor. As you know, in New Guinea, they suffered horrible deaths. The public has to know the truth to prevent wars. A murder was committed... but it was reported that the soldier died from disease. The world doesn't know the real facts of war. I wrote the book to make that clear. This is Sergeant Hashimoto's brother. Even Koshimizu invited us in. He didn't talk to us standing. But Yukio Seo did. So I beat him up. I had an operation and can't sit down too long. I see. You can sit over there. I'll sit here. We came to hear your story. Most of the other men told us the truth... the ugly truth, exactly what happened. I know it's hard, but... I couldn't reveal that in the book. So how can I tell you? - But... - It was so miserable. Tell us the truth. You were an accomplice... Forget it. I don't care. You can't possibly understand how I survived. When I heard you got an operation... I said that it was divine punishment. So I heard. - What? - I was so mad. It was no punishment. You're wrong. It's a matter of opinion. We see things differently. You're not the only one being punished. I almost starved to death in New Guinea. My wife got injured in an accident. I killed someone I didn't want to kill. If a misfortune befalls you, it means you deserve it. You've done nothing wrong? If I say no, you'll blame my ancestors. You killed people in New Guinea. - We all did. - So we're all being punished. There is no punishment. I tried my best. Well, that's a problem. There is no punishment. You suffered enough during the war and survived. Yet after the war, you had many operations. That's because you don't realize you're being punished. That's your opinion. Not mine. So you've done nothing wrong as a human being? Everybody has. So God is punishing us all. Yet you deny it. It's no punishment. I owe my survival to myself. You had your way. And I had mine. We can't be born together and die together. But we all have something in common. We did something terrible. Talking about it could be harmful. Read my book, and you'll know. I wrote how we survived, eating grass and tree roots. Everyone knows what that means. Any surviving soldiers can say that much. New Guinea is different. It was no place for human beings. Everybody ate bugs and worms. I don't expect to hear that from you. - But I... - I want the facts. I decided not to say anything beyond that. So I built a shrine for my buddies. After all, we were swept by the tide, misled by military leaders. That's why I worry about the world today. If you mean it, why not share your experience? So they won't start another war. - You saw hell, didn't you? - Yes. How can you console your buddies without talking about it? You keep silent for the sake of your family. You think it might harm them. Sergeant Hashimoto's brother. Is here to ask what happened. You owe him the truth, or at least an apology. Why should I apologize? You killed the sergeant. I don't know. You said it yourself. You told me so. You don't understand how I survived. If it was understandable, we all would've survived. Tell the truth for the sake of the dead. I consoled them my way. And you do it your way. I'm doing it my way. When I went to the Yasukuni Shrine and prayed... You think praying at Yasukuni consoled them? Stop. No violence. He's sick! You just film it and do nothing? Tell us! You wouldn't understand, even if I did. Admit that you killed him. Stop! Call the police! I'll call them. Where's the phone? He attacked me. He's sick. He doesn't look it. We're all victims. My son would get mad. It's all your fault. I helped you before. Don't blame them. You should lie down. Yamada! You want the police? Not if you behave. You suffered and I suffered. Tell us how! Why not? I had operations. Otherwise, I'd beat him. My son will be home soon. I can sue you. Do you want the police? Speak up! Yamada! You want them? Just calm down. If you could tell us exactly what happened... That I can't do. It was so horrible. It would upset everyone. It's so sad and cruel. I always pray that it won't happen again. But young people don't feel that way. Through movies, they think a war is heroic. You're still pretty strong. I'm sick, but... You can fight all right. In the hospital, I was afraid you might die. I still want to live. If you tell the truth, the world will realize the horror of war and it can prevent it. I know. Then, why not talk? We're not here to blame... You got so violent. Because you refuse to tell us. So I had to. Why are you forcing me to talk? Because it can make the sacrifice meaningful. You can make a difference by telling the truth. Since you experienced hell, it would mean a lot. Out of the 2nd and 3rd companies of the 36th Regiment... you and I are the only survivors. Out of the 1 st company, six survived. You saw the agony of hell more than anybody else. I didn't have to cannibalize. But the Wewak Garrison had to. They couldn't survive otherwise. I don't blame them, but I blame those who put us in such a state. And they have not been punished. The most responsible is that ignorant Hirohito. But he never apologized. Since the war, you dedicated your whole life to your family. I'm a father. But if you hadn't returned alive, you wouldn't have had a family. I know. So family and children are important indeed. But you must remember the fact that you survived New Guinea. - I know. - Then you must tell the truth. Your experience is invaluable. You are a sole surviving witness of the company. Yet you lived your life as if you saw nothing... caring only about your family. I don't think God approves it. He didn't send you home to live like those... who had not experienced the agony of war. So he punished you and caused you to suffer for so long. I killed a man I didn't want to kill ten years after the war ended. It was my punishment. I'd been thinking of my business and my living for ten years. God sent me and you back from New Guinea. I was God's messenger, but I betrayed His trust. I used to go to brothels, but I stopped after I went to prison. I didn't want to kill him, and I didn't want to be in jail... But I ended up in solitary confinement for ten years. That's because I was chosen to return alive from the war... yet I wasted ten years thinking of self-interest like an ordinary man, living shamelessly, not realizing my duty. So God punished me. We did many things to survive. You were able to return alive at the cost of many other lives. Does it hurt? Of course. His shoe hit me here. I tried to protect him. You know that re-armament of the US Army is under way. If everyone had experienced the same thing, I wouldn't have come to you. I wouldn't be interested in stories everyone knows. But you had a rare experience no one else can tell. It's precious. You're the only survivor and thousands died. You're representing them to express their suffering. You were chosen out of thousands who died... and survived to tell the truth to the world. Your experience is too precious to keep silent. There are things I can say, and things I can't say. It worth so much because it is difficult to talk about. It's not for my own sake. It'd harm the honor of the dead. I'm not asking you about everyone. It's about Sergeant Hashimoto. Excuse me, Mr. Yamada. Can we talk right now? Anytime. We're free. Aren't we? Sure. What do you want? You called us. He wanted to call you. But he reconsidered. I want to hear it from Mr. Yamada. That can wait. Detectives are around. We're uniformed officers. No difference. We're busy now. You aren't invited. Tell me why you called us. Why did you call? During the war, he killed a soldier. I'm here to find out the truth. We had a fight and kicked each other. - Then you beat him, too? - No. He attacked me. So he attacked you, Mr. Yamada? He did something worse. He killed a man and cannibalized him. We'll be outside. Suit yourself. None of your business. Just understand there are things I can't disclose. You can't force me to. I can't. I'm sorry. I'm sorry, but... Everybody has the right to live in peace. If I tell the truth, it might harm them. I thought really hard. I understand how you feel. But only you know the truth of the murder of Sergeant Hashimoto. Not exactly a murder. According to law, it was murder. It was reported that they were all killed in action. The colonel was reported to have killed himself. Did he shoot himself with a gun? Yes. But they say he neglected his duty as a commander. If I speak of one, I have to tell all. It was pitiful. It started around July in 1944 in the AA unit. But only five of you were left. Right? Cannibalization was forbidden. Was it at the end of the war when you were five? - No. - Earlier? - Much earlier. - So early? I don't want to speak ill of the dead - There were five of us left. - Five? Mr. Hashimoto was well bred, wasn't he? So he stole food from another unit as well? Yes. He found opportunities. We took a rest after walking for three days. They demanded we settle it. - Kill him? - They said "settle." - And you three consulted? - No, all of us. - With the other unit? - Yes. But they wanted us to do it. So they demanded you kill him? - Or we would be killed. - Right. We were that desperate. It was either his life or yours. - Not only yours but the others'. - All of us. You had to eat the "white" and "black" pigs. We were just desperate to live. You knew it was human flesh except the colonel who killed himself? Nobody told him. So pitiful. You ate the natives, too? No. They moved fast and we couldn't catch them. So unpopular soldiers became victims? Troublemakers and selfish ones. They became victims, but they just wanted to survive. I don't blame them. Were you in danger, too? - Many times. - Is that so? The fewer the men... the greater the risk of getting killed. But I was protected. I was helpful to them. So I was saved. So you were the only survivor in the 36th regiment. I was the only one. But you were helpful to them, so you were safe? I could find water and guide them in the jungle. I was a good guide. So they needed me. Some wanted to kill me and eat me, but others protected me. - That's how I survived. - So they didn't eat you. I'm determined to do anything for the victims. I have a plan for this year. I spent a total of 13 years and 9 months in jail. I decided to spend another 10 years in prison. I decided to spend another 10 years in prison. After all, violence is my forte. Sometimes you can't do everything. - Please forgive my violence. - That's all right. I'm sorry. You need to go to the bathroom? I'm paralyzed. I can't control my bladder. Paralyzed? His legs? He needs to pee. Oh, I see. He can't feel anything? It just comes out. Can't control it? Maybe I hurt my legs. I'll be responsible if need be. It's Sunday, but an ambulance will come. Should I make a call? I think he got hurt. I kicked him. Oh, it hurts. What happened? We had a fight and I kicked him. Mom, call me when you get there. Mr. Yamada didn't get hurt badly. I think my wife injury is worse. He must have an X-ray. My wife's injury looks worse. - She was trying to protect him. - I went like this. So I think she did a good job. If I had hurt Mr. Yamada, as badly as I did my wife, I would have felt responsible and my conscience would've suffered. Mr. Yamada's son-in-law told me that I should not use violence. But violence is justified if the end result is good. As long as I live, I'll continue to use violence by my judgment... if it brings good results to me for the sake of mankind. That's what I told him. Your mother has Come Come to the pier Again today like any other day Although I know it's too muCh to hope I Can't stop myself from Coming to the pier, Hoping your return In March 1983, Okuzaki went to New Guinea. The footage was confiscated by the Indonesian government. Okuzaki opens fire Ex-Officer's Son Wounded Kenzo Okuzaki The victim is in serious condition A Criminal At Large Okuzaki's Superior Officer's Son Seriously wounded "His son will do!" Hunt for Kenzo Okuzaki Okuzaki Arrested in Kobe My husband is under arrest for attempted murder. He asked me to deliver a message to Ex-Captain Koshimizu. To prove divine punishment, he made a decision to kill Koshimizu. He told his plan to his close friends, including myself. On December 15 last year, he couldn't kill Koshimizu. Instead, he shot Koshimizu's son. Okuzaki understood that the fact his son didn't die was providence. He shed tears of gratitude three times in his prison cell. He wants Koshimizu to tell the court about the murder he committed. His testimony will console the dead, and help prevent another war. Hiroshima Prison He's doing very well. - Is he? - Yes. - Not cold? - No. It's warm in there. His appetite? He says food is much better than at home. And God is with him. He did what he could. So he's satisfied. September 18, 1986, Shizumi Okuzaki died at age 68. January 28, 1987, Okuzaki was sentenced to 12 years at hard labor.
