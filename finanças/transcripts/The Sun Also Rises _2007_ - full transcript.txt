Or a well, they'd do, An idiot stands by a well, stares in and mumbles: "13... 13... " The madman in the tree sees him, jumps down and asks, "What are you mumbling?" The idiot glares at him and says: "13... 13... " The madman, curious. peeks into the well. The idiot lifts up his foot.. Splash! Kicks the madman down the well. The idiot goes on: "14... 14...

She dug the pit? That's not like her. She wasn't like this before! One day. she bought a pair of new shoes, Said they came from a dream Finally, she hanged her shoes on the tree, Then she couldn't find them. She climbed the tree, yelling madly Then she fell down, When she came to, she recalled nothing. She began climbing trees, Now she's digging a pit, Just buy her another pair! I did! She didn't want them. Said they weren't the same, What's she doing now? Looking for her shoes. That's not like her. That year. she brought you home from far away, I just became a cop, She was amazing! What's so funny? Li Congxi! Ma'am Say hi to Uncle Li, Uncle Li. He's a good man, I'd never find this place without him. You were just a rookie, In the blustering storm, you almost wept from fear! They've brought me back after 10 years, You got transferred?

He looked like you. minus what I look like What exactly did he look like? Don't cry, I'll tell you a couple of things about him, You'll know more than if you'd met him, Your father was a Most Lovable Person. My father? Not your father his troop, Everyone in his troop was called a Most Lovable Person, My father was a soldier? My school had asked a Most Lovable Person to give a speech. Your father came My hometown is far away by the sea, This place is your father's hometown. He said there were a thousand people watching. but he saw only me, He only had eyes for me. giving his speech to no one but me, Then he came over and shook only my hand. The entire school surrounded us. He was that great? Bullshit! That was his story I don't remember anything like that. And then? At first your father was this long. then this long. then this long. And finally, this long, My father? Your father's gun, He had a gun? It was pouring that day, Your father came to see me with his gun. I said, "No. " He said: "I know, I know. " And I went with him I left the ocean, left my hometown. Have no fear of forgetting Rather, dread remembering Remembering breeds familiarity Familiarity makes you flee Who said that? Your father, His name was... Alyosha, My father's name was Alyosha? He wasn't from the Soviet Union. Now. you know what your father was like. Boy! Boy! Why do you run when you see me? Mom! Look at you. you're soaking wet, Where were you? I saw you. You see? I'm fine now. I haven't been myself recently. Like... like I almost went crazy. That's what some people said. Actually, you're okay. I think it was because of a fish? It was a pair of shoes, Shoes with fish embroidery? That's right. Actually.. Actually, I didn't lose them. See, aren't they right here? I'm fine now. They say that I've been acting crazy. And that everyday... I slapped you several times. Not everyday, Come here. let me see, I must have slapped you a thousand times, Not that many, I won't hit you anymore. Really. Never again, I promise. never again, You can hit me if you want. Really. it's okay. I won't keep you. you're busy, Mom. I'm not busy, You're not? Let's talk more. They make you bookkeeper, then group leader... because I'm crazy. It's not because of that. See? You think I'm crazy. I very nearly went crazy, You... Don't you have to pick up some people today? Someone's been sent to the countryside, Then go, Go pick them up. They don't know this place, go pick them up. It'd be bad if they got lost. I know, I know. I said: "I know, I know. " I'm not going anywhere today. Not climbing trees not digging pits. not hitting or cursing people Go pick them up, I'll wait for you here, I'll sit right here. We'll chat more when you're back, I'm off. Group leader! What's going on? Your mom! What about her? Beautiful Solo River I sing for you Your glorious history Is forever embedded in my heart In dry seasons You flow gently In rainy seasons you make waves And run off to distant shores Your crew comes from Solo The mountains send you on your way The waves running off to distant shores All the way to seas and oceans Your history is like a ship Carrying its crew on a long journey On the beautiful river Your crew comes from Solo The mountains send you on your way The waves running off to distant shores All the way to seas and oceans Beautiful Solo River I sing for you Your glorious history Is forever embedded in my heart Hello? Pervert! Who was that? What did he say? Come on, yell us, I can't repeat it. I'll get it. Pervert! I can't tell you. I can't say it. I'll get it. What did he say this time? Why didn't you tell me? Fuck your mother! Thank you, Hold on. Here. I don't mean to be a pain, but this is how Norman Bethune died, I'm just afraid of needles, even more than knives. Tetanus is serious matter. Thanks, You're welcome, Hang on one second. Can you give me a hand? What a pain... It's only noon. Try them on, Are your hands clean? Help me wring it, Is your hand okay? It's fine. It really is a size bigger! How did you do it? They were too small, They're big enough now, Aren't they nice. Teacher Liang? Catch the pervert! It's not him! Hurry! "Not him"? Teacher Liang. Dr Lin? It's grass underneath. You can let go, Let go. jump down, I'm off now. This way! Number 2. Number 1. End of test, Sorry, at the movie the other night I was standing, it felt different from when I'm sitting. Let's try again? We studied the case. and we consent to your request. so as not to wrong an innocent man. Dr Lin, you may try again, OK... This time. stand in the middle, away from the cloth. And don't move. Say stop when you think it's the one, I'll call the numbers. Each number represents a person. who will "do it". Please be precise. Alright. Let's begin. Number 1. Number 2. Number 3. Stop, We can stop now, Dr Lin? Did you say stop just now? Yes, Are you sure that's the hand? I'm sure. How can you be so sure? Because that evening, the hand brushed me, What? Let me explain. I'm not afraid of people touching me, but when that hand brushed me. I got really scared. Dr Lin, did you see the movie that evening? Of course, Were you in front or behind the screen? In front. Dr Lin, thank you for your cooperation. But I'm sorry... You've got the wrong man, Number 3 wasn't where you said, He was too far away and couldn't have touched you, Of course, it's also our fault. We didn't ask you where you were exactly that night, Thank you anyway, Where was number 3 standing? That I can't yell you, Is number 3 Liang? Yes, but he was too far away from you. Couldn't we try again? That won't be necessary. Someone shouted "catch the pervert". you ran ahead of everybody. and everybody mistook you for the pervert, It doesn't sound convincing. Say you run fast as you used to be an athlete. Still it's not convincing, Say you were scared of being beaten up, so you ran into my flat and jumped down, Even less convincing, I did some research. This is the situation: One. five women were touched. Two, none of them identified you as the culprit, But people caught you and beat you up, which made you suspect No, 1, Three. even though you are suspect No, 1, there's one very crucial point: No matter how. one hand can't touch five butts at the same time. So what does that mean? Other 4 or 5 persons will get caught, I suggest that we act fast. I write a confession and you sign it, Be first to confess and you may get off lightly! I'm not sure. Not sure? I'm not sure... If I did... or... did not. Teacher Liang... that you've got to ask yourself, Those were butts... If it wasn't a hand touching them, then it's those butts touching a hand. Catch the pervert! This hand! It's this hand! At that time all I saw were flashlights, I couldn't make out any of their faces. but they all saw mine, There were 42 flashlights, I was lying in a ditch... with a broken leg, Tell me... Did the woman in front of you shout "catch the pervert?" No. I'm absolutely sure she didn't shout "catch the pervert. " It's me, Lin. Sorry, I can't stay long, I only can stay a few minutes, I came by... to have a little chat with you, then I have to go, I know the doctors here well. I'm sorry... I couldn't save you, But don't be afraid, No matter what happens, I'm always with you You weren't even at the movie. Why did you identify me? You fell for it too, I needed to draw attention to myself... before making a revelation. I wanted to convince them that you touched me... And then I'd tell them that I have feelings for you. What feelings? Even if you mean what you say, why pick this time and occasion? It was the perfect moment I had it all planned out, When you touched me I'd start screaming, and wait for their final question, "Do you have anything else to say?" And if they did? That would be so perfect, It would be so great. I'd hold you, tell them I love you. and I want you to touch me. That I'm yours! I really can be yours, But they just didn't ask that crucial question, Wu is such a fool! I'm sorry. I couldn't help you, But I want to help you. Don't worry. I'll convince them that you touched me, I won't let them take you away. That day when you touched me. I could smell you, I made up all that about you groping me. It was your scent that I fell for, I could smell you every time you visited my clinic. When you're 10 metres away. I blush. When you're 2 metres away, my heart races, That day when I was bandaging your finger, can you imagine how hard that was? You were too close! Every time I smell you, I feel I'm fainting. Like I'd caught all of a sudden all kind of disease, But it didn't feel bad! That day you went up behind me, and got so close to me... When your hand touched me, I just totally lost it, I just wanted to fall into your arms. Dr Lin... You may be 36... Or 46? Sorry. this isn't what I want to talk about. What you're saying makes you sound like a 16-year-old. Teacher Liang, let me tell you: human feelings are not a formula, You're far too rational, Goodbye! I know you don't know what to do with me I'm too abrupt, You're nervous. you're shy, You feel embarrassed, But when I heard the door slam, my heart almost broke! How can I leave you all alone? How can I let you get hurt again? But as soon as I smell you, I'm too excited for words! I'm going to faint. Please let me go... Let me go... My heart is aching! I can't breathe! If I pass out, I'm as good as dead. If I die, it'd cause you even more trouble! I don't want to go but I must. I shall return. I shall return. Teacher Liang... I heard everything she said to you, Who? Dr Lin! Who are you? If I didn't steal this robe to come here, you'd never get to know me, I didn't want to come. But when I saw even someone like Dr Lin came, I couldn't stay away, What a slut! What's the big idea? That day at the movies, I was right behind you. You didn't see me, but I had my eye on you the whole time, When you reached out your hand, how I wished you'd touch me! But you touched someone else, Is your heart as blind as your eyes? Or why would you be lying here? Because I didn't want to shout "catch the pervert", The five punks in the cafeteria, each time I see them watching you, singing along with you, and kneading dough at the same time.. I hate it! Hate it! I hate it! So I called them up, Called them? Yes. Why did you call? I just wanted to hear your voice over the phone. I finally heard it! What did you hear? "Fuck your mother"! Don't think that I didn't understand. I did! But I heard more than the words. I heard your soul! Hearing your voice, hearing your voice speak to me. overnight. I grew up, I have the courage to stand before you, I understand what beauty is. what it's like to be loved, what happiness is, Go away, Go away, Easy. It'll be fine once it's off. It's not ready. It's okay, I'll get some rope to tie it up, Those are wires! Why do you hang laundry here? This will work, Don't use that, A gun? Where's the other half? I've seen this gun in Xinjiang. It's all here. It works! Take it if you want. just leave me the holster. That was a gift from my mom, Great. I take the gun. you keep the holster, Brother. cheer up, Let's go for a walk. You can't always stay at home, You'll go crazy, No one bothered you anymore since you confessed. I love I love The pure water of Wanquan River The Red Army once poached wild fruits with its water I love The big waves of Wanquan River It feels strange here, Strange, Liang! T ang! Director Wu is looking for you, Director Wu? Let's go, Five Fingers Mountain Protect our red rivers and mountains The Red Army is strong and mighty How was my singing? Tomorrow we'll show the same movie, in the same place. Before that we're having a variety show, And I'm going to sing this song, At the film tomorrow. 5 people will be absent. Because the cops have caught the 5 assailants. and found the 5 asses that they groped. They've even met, Among the ten, none are from our school, Have a seat. Thanks I kept rambling on about the movie. Did you come for this? I wanted to tear it up when I received it. Then I thought. better do it in front of you. We'll tear it up today. and we'll burn it, Liang! T ang! Thanks! I should be thanking you for reassuring me once again. that none of our teachers is that kind of man! But the struggle remains complicated. These are my first few months here, and no one's going to frame me or fool me. I won't stand for it! Our show tomorrow is the best answer to those plotters! Good news? I heard Wanquan River stop for a while. Do you need my help? I'll help you wring it out in a while. If we didn't go for a walk. could the good news come so soon? Let me treat you both to dinner. T reat us? Me and Director Wu? You and Dr Lin, Good! Did you tell her? Yes. You lied. you're so typical, She'll be over in a bit, How did you tell her? You went to blow your horn I blew my horn, and I called her. That'll do. Damn. I forgot to tell her, The code means "my place". Watch her knock. Come off it! Open the door. It's not locked. Come off it! Beautiful Solo River I sing for you Your glorious history Is forever embedded in my heart It feels strange here, What did you say? It feels strange. I said it feels strange here! Is something the matter? He said it feels strange here, Wild pheasants, Can we shoot them? They don't belong to anyone. A gun? Can't you learn to behave? You're here for labour reform, Got it, great shot! He wants to bribe you. It's still alive! T ake it. No! A mother knows her son best, Is she right? Right! What did she say? A mother knows her son best, What does that mean? I don't know. It means that no one knows a son better than his mother You're not her son. are you? That's her point, Pervert! I don't want a son like you, If I were your boss, I'd send you down too, Whatever. Group leader! What? Your mom! What about my mom? Sorry. We came at a bad time, didn't we? Let's go, This is your new home. Clean it up. I've got work. I won't come in, Young comrade Let me give you a hand. No, it's okay, Welcome to labour reform. No, I'm not here to be reformed. I just accompany him here. Young comrade take this with you, Alright, You sure know how to talk, Of course. You're the one who needs reform. Why does he say "you two"? You're right. This place feels strange, It's like somewhere else. Hello! Have you ever been away? No. Then how would you know? I wasn't born here, Strange, You've never been away but you were born elsewhere. Where were you born? On the tracks. On the tracks? You mean on a train. On the tracks, On the tracks. but not under the train. That's what my mom said, Have you ever seen a train? I think so but I don't recall. Have you found your mom? I'm still searching, Where's the gun? Why is it not on the wall? Go! What should I call you? Just call me "Uncle". Uncle Tang, Feels like we're related. Re-education by the peasants makes us close like family, What do I call her? Call her "Aunt Tang". That sounds weird, Then call her "Auntie". "Auntie" is weird too, Are you a teacher? Some kids won't go to school, Can you help? I studied petroleum, What can I teach them? T ake them hunting in the hills, You'll get work credits for it, Hunting? I like that, Okay, Look up there! You're crazy! The first shot scared me off the chair. The second made me spill water everywhere, You're totally crazy! On the tractor, I should've told you off, Auntie. I'm sorry, Never know when to stop. Why don't you come with us? Just go away! Got it! Who caught it? I did! Me! Uncle, why don't you shoot? Why don't you shoot? Old Dad! There are little birds and eggs! Get down! Put the bird down and get down! You little rascal!

Our catch of the day. I'll add them as work credits. Thank you. Auntie... She has a question for you, Who? Her. She says she's trusted you from the first time she saw you, What does she want to know? She says she likes the way you look. I don't look very good now. spending all my time with them. She says she's been watching you and likes your clothes. She wants to be like you. You're so young, what's the hurry? It'll take you 20 years to look like me, She asks you where the name Alyosha is from, Alyosha? Right! Alyosha, It sounds Soviet. What about Kachyosha? Soviet too, It's a woman's name, but also the name of a cannon. A cannon? Y es. A cannon with a woman's name. She doesn't understand anything, And you? Do you understand? Me neither, How old is she? I'm sixteen and I can sing "Li Tiemei". Uncle! What is it? Uncle, Where's the pheasant? Report. Our catch of the day. I'll add it as work credits. You're great! Two birds with one stone. No, 3 birds. Three? The first is the pheasants, the second is them. and you are the third, I'm giving you work credits. Isn't your home that way? I'm not going yet. The kids are waiting there, Your father's is a long story, Your grandfather drove him away, He enlisted and never came home. What was my father like? This is your father. I can tell from the hands. So my father... The enemy killed your grandfather the year after your father left, The village people buried him. He once gave me candy. The first candy of my life. Then my father... Enough. He's drunk. When I first came here. both your father and your grandfather were gone, On the same day. I brought you and your mom here. Now your mom's gone too. She's gone too. Here's the story, under government policy your father was not a martyr. But your grandfather, he was a martyr. I've never met my father nor my grandfather, I've only ever known my mother Great! Do you think that... when a person dies... he can still laugh? I'm off. Where did he go? I don't know. He said he's off. Uncle! Are you drunk? I'm not drunk. Then why did you leave without a word? Who made you angry? I'm not angry, Are you coming back? Y es. I'll be back in the morning, Quit following me. Go back! Go back! Your Uncle T ang says... my belly feels like velvet. Just call me Alyosha, Come here, I want to talk to you, No, Come here, No, Come here, No, Tang... just do whatever you want. You know. what you did might cost a man his life, You want to die. Maybe. But there's one thing I don't understand. Speak up. Uncle T ang. what is velvet? You're already dead. Stop inventing excuses. I'm not looking for excuses, You can kill me now, But I really don't know what velvet is, Okay, I'll tell you, It's a fucking piece of fabric. Fabric? How can it be fabric? You don't get it. do you? Alright, I'll find some for you, But remember the day you see velvet is the day you die, Beijing Station This is your wife, 40 years old. This is the group leader. 20 years old, What's your wife like? She lived in Shanghai for many years. She's a sophisticated woman, The group leader is a peasant boy. Never even seen a damn train. There's a 20-year age difference. If they get together. who is at fault? You even divorced your wife over this, You think it's her fault? I tell you, it's not, I'll draw it out for you, This is you. You've been married for 20 years. You two have lived apart for years, All your affairs over the years. I'll just ignore, Now, you're in the hills with a bunch of kids. hunting, drinking. blowing horns, And your wife's at home by herself, You act crazy and leave your wife at home, You tell me if that's your fault or not! Get out of the toilet if you don't need it, I can get you velvet if you want, But it'll take 5 or 6 days, I'm not the boss at our unit, There's no velvet there? You had to come to Beijing for it? Where are you going? 1... 2... 3... This is the trend in Beijing. I'll count to 3 again, 1... 2... 3... This is for you, Thank you for the present. Can we go and play? Yes you may, I'm leaving in a couple of days. Take care of yourself. Don't worry, This is for our brigade, And this too. I'll add them as work credits. Two extra credits. I went away too, You didn't find it. but I did. Is this it? It isn't like your wife's belly at all. First he cooked the shoes, so well you could eat them. then he put them on a bigger shoe mould. When the shoes dried. they got bigger! He said to me: "I can make your shoes big, I can also make your belly big!" Where I'm from in the south, there's a big bridge, He said to me there: "Marry me, or I'll jump!" I thought he was bluffing, When they rescued him his heart had stopped beating, But one evening we went there again, I knew what he wanted and I shook my head. And he jumped off the bridge again. but again he survived. You know. no one has ever jumped off that bridge and come back alive. I was touched. I wanted to say yes, But he disappeared, Where did he go? Guess! To the motherland. to help rebuild the country, He was gone for three years. He began writing to me from day 1, His letters were so obscene! So embarrassing... He wrote about our first time. I couldn't read it! I nearly fainted. But I was curious because it seemed so real, He wrote about having a son with me, and how I got pregnant again. He said... he was a good shot, See how awful he was? Comparing it to shooting a gun, What a sex maniac! Suddenly. one day. there were no more letters, Like when he jumped from bridge and was washed away by water. I started getting really worried, During those three years I had another man courting me, We even got engaged, Ten days ago. I got another letter from him, Only eleven words: "Come. marry me. September 10th, I'll wait for you here!" T day is September 10th, I come to here for wedding. And he said I must ride a white camel, so that he could see me at night. and that he'd be waiting at the end of the road. What nonsense! Is there an end to this road? End of the Road Not End of the Road I'm going this way. And you? Still not talking? Maybe you don't speak Chinese. Alright then, Goodbye, Alyosha is dead. What a surprise, They didn't expect anything like this to happen. But accident did happen. Natasha and Alyosha lie together forever on the border. Our investigation shows innocence and naivety were responsible for changing their fate, My child. you're here at last, Natasha and Alyosha were so unfortunate! But you are even more unfortunate. I am also a woman. I truly understand how you feel, You're pregnant with his child. How sad! But yesterday is already in the past. We have to go on with our lives. All of us have to go on with our lives, And there's a child, I believe that if Alyosha could see his own child. he would be so happy in heaven, Comrade Yekachylina Alexandrovna. her husband's name wasn't Alyosha. His name was Li Bukong, Li Bukong. She can't pronounce Chinese, So we called him Alyosha. Just like in those letters. We found some of his letters, I'd like to give them to you. Take them, they're yours, For investigation purposes. my Chinese comrades and I opened and read these letters, Please forgive me. My child. my poor child. please forgive me! That day. I was riding my bike, wobbling along the river bank, You came towards me, in a clean army uniform, Like a hero. I knew right away that these 3 shots could never have killed you. I know, I know. I know, I know. With these 3 holes in your jacket. and this pile of stuff, you want to tell me that you're dead, I don't believe you, You want to go with another woman. then go. Spare me these lies. On my way here I was thinking of what I should say to you, I didn't know. But now I know. Bukong... I used to be younger than you. From now on. I can be older than you, Most Loveable Bukong... Bukong... From now on. your name... shall be Alyosha. End of the Road End of the Road End of the Road Your belly is like velvet, Help! Alyosha! Don't be afraid! The train has stopped above, When the day breaks he will smile, Alyosha! Don't be afraid! The train has stopped above! When the day breaks he will smile! Alyosha! Don't be afraid! The train has stopped above! When the day breaks he will smile! Alyosha! Don't be afraid! The train has stopped above! When the day breaks he will smile!
