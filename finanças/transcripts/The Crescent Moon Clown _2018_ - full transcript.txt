- Why are there cameras everywhere? I don't know, mom, it's just weird. Is daddy gonna get rid of them? What? There are not raccoons in the attic. No, and I better not hear anything. I just got here about an hour ago. How about last night or this morning? Okay, you guys have a good time. I'll see you next week. I love you. That's some weird ass toys. I wonder what's in here. Oooh, what the hell is that smell? This better not be someone's ashes. What the hell? What is up with these people and these toys. Nope, mm-mm. Go right back, take it outside to your new home. Oooh, it stinks. You are going outside. It's cold. That's, that's from inside. What the... Hello? Hello? Hello? What? Hello? Who did this? Who did this? Reggie, if you're here, stop playing. You know damn well my dad will whoop your ass if he knew you were in here while he wasn't. Hello? Well, whoever it is wanna come and clean this up because I'm not cleaning this up. Who's doing this? Hello? Whoever made this mess, I swear, got me cleaning this damn mess. All this damn fake blood. This is freaking annoying. This is disgusting. Look at this. If this stains my, if this stains my mom's floor... Hello? Look at this. Are you serious? Fuck. This shit ain't funny. What the hell? Who's doing this? Fuck, fuck. Who's doing this? I'm tired of fucking cleaning. Look at this shit. What is this? Oh, this better not be blood. Look at it all on the counter. Hello? All right, stop playing around now. Hello? Hello? Hello? Hello? Oh shit, I got my own washer and dryer up here. That's dope. I don't have to go all the way downstairs. Just come right up here. Who's down there? You better get the hell out of here. How do I know someone's not watching me? Where's the light? I know it's not Reggie. I checked his Instagram and he's in North Carolina. I know it's not raccoons. I sent you the video of hello written all over the floor and raccoons wouldn't-- Mom, why is daddy yelling? Please tell daddy it's not one of my friends. I don't know who it is, but I'm scared and I'm not imagining things. What do you mean I might be doing it? Sleepwalking? I haven't done that since I was 10 years old, mom. I guess it's possible, but how would I know? Okay, momma, I will. Love you too. Hello? Hello? What is this doing in the dryer? Raccoons, it's no damn raccoons. These goddamn dolls. Shit. It's cold in here. And what is that smell? What are you still doing here? Uh-uh. You gotta go. Nope. Nope, nope, nope, nope. Mm-mm. Stupid. Who's doing this? It's not funny anymore. Please stop. Come on now. Hello? Please stop doing this. You're upsetting me. I should call the police. What the hell? What the heck? Hey, it's me, guys. And I am back. Um, I'm in our new house on Steelmanville Road and one of your fools think it's funny to sneak in here and scare me on my first night. If my dad finds out you're in here, he's gonna kill you. Momma, you need to get some of this shit cleaned out of here. All right, this my aunt Bebe's room. I just put a tape on it, so I can tell if someone's going in or out, but it's locked, so, yeah. If you're hiding in here, I'm gonna find you. Hello? You better not be hiding back here. I'm gonna find you if you're in here. Hello? And my parents' bedroom is locked. I don't think my parents trust me. Hello? This door was opened and now it's locked. I think it's so creepy that someone might be in here because what if it's somebody I don't know? Who's in there? Hello? Hello? I need a weapon. Who are you? Who are you? If you don't leave, I'm gonna call the police. You better get the fuck out of here. Hello? Dee, come pick me up. I just texted you my new address. Listen, I'll just explain it to you when you get here. Why not? Well, can you borrow your mom's car? Let me call you back. Are you coming to get me? You don't get off till six? What? Girl, there's some crazy shit happening here. You Googled the address? Here? And what popped up? Girl, there ain't no such thing as no haunted house. Oh shit. Hello? Shit. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. Nobody better not come in here. I swear. Oh fuck. Oh fuck. Fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck. - Don't come down here. - What the... My phone. I need my phone. Shit. Fuck. Hello? Shit. Shit, shit. Fuck. Oh fuck. What the fuck? Shit, fuck. Oh, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus. Ah. What's happening? Stop it. Stop it right now, goddammit. What do you want from me? Leave me alone! - Ah! Fuck. Oh. Hello? If anyone's watching this, please come save me. I'm on Steelmanville Road and I'm chained up right now. Please help. Someone help me! Help me! Please help me! Fuck. - Fuck. - Who the fuck are you? - I'm Tom Riley. Who the fuck are you? - This is my house. - Ow, shit. Well, it used to be my house. - So, are you the old man watching me on these damn cameras everywhere? - Look, get over yourself. I'm binge-watching 13 Reasons Why on the iPad I took from this house and in the middle of it, I keep getting these push notifications, 'cause the cameras are still on the iPad connected here. So, I don't give a shit what you're doing in this house. And here I see you running around-- - All right, well did you see the damn clown? - Clown? - Yes, the clown that chained me up down here. I bet you didn't see him. - I hate clowns. Let... Can we get you out of that? - Yes. - Can I have this here, Wonder Woman? - This hurts. Can you... - I think these should do it. Goddammit. - Here, let me do it. - If I can't do it, you can't. Here. Slow down, girl. Damn. I came in here, these lights were off. The front door was open. This door was open. - The door was unlocked? - Yeah, it was wide open. - I locked it. - Here, let's go. Well, where you going? - I'm getting out of here. - We don't know where he's at, so come, let's just figure this out, come on. Figure it out. There was a book here, used to be here. Where the hell is it? Oh wait, here it is, come on. Yeah, this is it. This is the book I was talking about. - I was checking that out earlier. - Does clown begin with a K or a C? - Are you for real? - Come on. - A C. - All right, here it is. Is that him? - Yep, that's him. - All right, that is the Crescent Moon Clown, which can only rise during a crescent moon. However, according to this, the previous owner had put it into a box, covered it with ashes, and sat a cross on top, and then locked the box and put it away. Did you find a box like this? - Yeah, I found it downstairs and it had this ugly doll in it and it was stinkin', so I threw it outside. - So you opened it. - Yep. - And you took the cross out. - Yep. - Well, that's how he got free. But, even though it's a crescent moon, and he's out of the box, he needs a witch to be able to convert him into a large form, like you say he is now. Have you seen anything that looks like a witch around? - That nasty lookin' thing with the robe on? - Yeah, that sounds like, that sounds like it. Well, we'll deal with her later. We gotta deal with him first. But you want the good news or the bad news? - I don't know. - There is no good news. Here's the bad news. According to this, the way the Crescent Moon Clown pays back his person that freed him is by digging a grave, killing them, throwing them in it, and burying them. So, right now, this clown is somewhere out back there, digging a hole for you. - Nope. - But I have an idea. I have an idea how we're gonna deal with this. Come on, follow me. All right, so here's what we're gonna do. He still thinks you're chained and locked in the basement. So, that means he's coming back to get you. So, what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna hide in this room right here and when he comes in that door, he's gonna come here to turn and go down the basement and I'm gonna run forward and just shove him down the steps, shove him as hard as I can. Hopefully he snaps his neck. But I'll slam the door shut. I'll push that chair over and you and I will get out of here and get as far away from this place as possible. - For real? - This is what we're gonna do. So, while you go hide out there, keep an eye. - All right. - I'm gonna hide here and we'll wait for him to come back. All right? - All right. - Fuck. - What the fuck? Give me my damn wig. You don't fuck with a black girl's hair. - Did we get him? Oh fuck, oh shit. - You want some of this too, bitch? Come on. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Stop it. - Ow. - Renee, our plan worked. Wait, where are you going? Hang on. Wait up. - Can you give me a ride to my friend's? - I would love to, but I don't own a car. - Of course you don't. - Hang on. So, you gonna stay here? - No, I'm getting out of here. I'm moving out of the south, fool. What the hell was that? - Ah, it's a long story.
