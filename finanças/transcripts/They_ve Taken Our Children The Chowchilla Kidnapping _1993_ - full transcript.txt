(Multicom Jingle) - [Narrator] The following is based on a true story. Some names have been changed. (slow paced music) (indistinct chatter) - Ouch, that hurt! I'm telling mom when we get home! - Alright, let's keep it down to a dull roar back there! - We're just having fun Edward. - Y'all acting like a barrel full of monkeys. (kid imitating monkey) (laughing) The monkey business gotta stop or we're staying right here! - You can't do that. (children laughing) - No more monkey business. I'm the monkey in charge here okay? Sit. Stay. You too. (children laughing) You too. Okay. (slow paced music) - How much did we pay for this one? - [Blonde] 350. - I put 180 in so far, what do you figure? I say we ask 1,000 firm. - Alright, that's what, $500 profit? - [Blonde] If we sell it. - Split three ways, that's nothing. - Your folks home? - I don't know, my grandma is though. Why? - I don't know. What you gonna do tonight? - I don't know, nothing I guess. - [Narrator] Your mom and dad want us home for dinner. - How much you figure we made this month? - Not enough. This isn't working too good. These things just aren't moving. - I need some money. I need some money bad. - What are you talking about? Your parents got more money than God. - Yeah, well my folks have had so much for so long that they don't think much of money. They live like dirt farmers. - Yeah. I guess 78 acres of dirt, richest suburb of San Francisco. This place is worth more than Rhode Island. - I can hit up my grandma though. I'd have to lie. I could do that. - Maybe if I got some money I could get my parents off my back. I'm supposed to be a podiatrist like dear old dad you know. - You gonna live for now man. Risk, daring, it all comes to the fast and the strong. That is who makes it in this world. The bold and the daring. - Like you and your old cars huh? You're very bold and daring. (grunting) - [Jim] What'd you do that for? You okay? - Okay, so the car thing ain't working out. There's got to be way to score some big money. (horn honking) - Talk about it later, I gotta go. - Yeah, go home to mommy and daddy. (slow paced music) - You know Odessa, sometimes I feel like I've got all a man could ever need. Take a look, it's not much, but it's ours. Come here my darling Hannah. We have a beautiful daughter, and a beautiful grandchild. Yes, and a beautiful wife. - Oh, I told the girls down at work that if you ever won the lottery, you'd probably just buy a new battery for that old tractor. - Maybe, and a new transmission for the old school bus. - Look, Lee's coming by for Hannah in an hour and they're gonna stay for dinner. Now Hannah, you tell grandpa be sure to get washed up and ready. - Hannah, you tell her that I'll be done in 20 minutes. - I think it's about time you started putting your nose to the grindstone Fred. Frankly, you're becoming an embarrassment and I won't have it. You've been given everything, now do something with it instead of squandering it away-- - You were giving everything too. What do you do? - What's that supposed to mean? - You inherited everything from Grandma, so why are you acting like you earned everything on your own? - Don't use that tone with me young man. I've worked. I run this quarry and I run this family. Fred enough. - You need to prove you're worthy of our family name. It's an old name, a proud name. We've been a part of the history of this state since the gold rush and I won't have my only son treat his heritage like the dole. You just seem to have one harebrained, worthless scheme after another. (slow paced music) (horse neighs) - You're leaving again dad? - Rodeo up at Calgary. - Can I go? - No, you got school and you gotta be man of the house while I'm gone. Well maybe I don't want to be the man of the house. - Times gonna come when you gotta measure up to being a man whether you're ready or not. Life doesn't always wait on ya. Here, why don't you load up that other horse for me while I say goodbye to your mom. Go on. (horse neighs) Whoa whoa Tim! Come on Tim, you gotta show that horse who's boss. - [Mom] Jack. - He's spooked some dad! - Spooked? Easy. - You're being a little hard on him aren't ya? - Yeah well maybe you're being a little too soft on him. - Come on mom. - Still think we could renovate this place? - Yeah we could. But we don't even have enough for the down payment. - Oh I think my grandma on cough up the dough. But think about how much work it is. I got a better idea. - What? Use grandma's money, make some big money. - [Jim] Yeah right, how? - A movie. We come up with a story, produce it. - What do we know about making movies? - Nothing, who does? I got a friend at film school says it's a breeze. You know what they make. People like stories about crime and violence. - I saw this Clint Eastwood movie last week. They hijacked this bunch of kids, it was great. - Kids. That's really smart. People would pay ransom right away for kids. - Yeah, but they blew it in the movie Fred. - Yeah, yeah, but if you did it right, really planned it. See that's where they always screw up. They're stupid, they don't plan it. You remember that busload of kids that crashed? How upset everyone was? For a bus full of kids you could get a million dollars. Easy. - What the heck, two million. - Three million huh? - Five million. Five million dollars from the state of California. Let's plan it. See if it can work. - That's crazy. - Yeah we are. But what else you got to do? It's just a game. See if we can come up with something. - Come up with what? A movie on a crime? (ominous music) - A crime. A perfect crime. (ominous music) (slow paced music) - [Brunette] Just like clockwork. - You did too! I'm telling mom! - I got your peanut butter fix for ya. Kisses. - Hey mom! - You better not. - No fighting. You have homework? - [Girl] I don't but Peter does! - How would you know anyway? - Mom, he hit me! He's been a pest all day! - She's lying! She's just trying to get me in trouble! - Stop it! I come home from work and you two start it up, the both of you, fight fight fight. Just cool it. - [Fred] All right Jim come on, you've got enough time. What do you got for me? - I've looked through hundreds of pages of County section Maps, I finally found the perfect place. Chowchilla. It's remote, it's got plenty of escape routes, far from the law, and just the right size. - Taking this a little bit serious for a game aren't you? - This is excellent work Jim. Attention to detail. I like it. How far is this place? - It's only three hours from here. - Let's go for a ride. (bell ringing) This is good. - This is ridiculous. Come on, let's go home. - Come on, relax, what's the big deal? Man can you believe this place is only three hours from Portola Valley? The kids though. - Too many kids. Too many people around here and way too much traffic. - Summer school starts in two weeks. There'll be a lot less kids then. - Can we get out of here? You guys are getting a little too serious. (ominous music) - We'd have to have him get pretty far from the school. - He turns on road 16. Map this on your chart there. When he goes down road 12, he's as far from anyone possible. (indistinct chatter) - Look at that guy, dumb is a post I bet. - This is the place. - Place for what? - What do you think we've been cruising this dump for? We got this thing all damn near planned out. Don't we? - Damn near. Damn near. - Are you in? 'Cause it's a go. (applauding) - [Narrator] Now shooting down the chute we've got Johnny Miller! (loud horn honking) Okay, Johnny takes his full eight seconds! Nice job cowboy! That's the way to go! All righty now, up next we got Tim Pearson out of chute number four. He's riding Bambino. And Tim's representing the Pearson Farms today! So good luck to you Timmy! - Okay son, make me proud. - Good to go. (loud ringing) - [Narrator] Ooh, tough luck there. Hang in next time there Timmy! (indistinct speaking) - Thanks. - You're never gonna win a buckle that way. - I think you did just fine. You get a buckle from me anytime. (slow paced music) - Okay, we'll wait to register these things until just before. - [Rick] Why? - In case anybody gets the license plates, the information will get lost in the bureaucracy. - Alright, we got to refit these interiors, and we got to install the CBs, and you guys have got to get a name out of the phone book that we can register these things to. - We're gonna do all this in a month? - We gotta finish before summer school's out. You got any better ideas? - Hey, is it safe to do the work here at your folks? - Let me worry about that. Also, I got an old x-ray machine. - An x-ray machine? - Yeah, and some parachutes and some mannequins too. - Hey Jim. We're gonna be late for dinner. - Watch your step squirt. - I will. - Hey, I didn't know you could talk. - Bye Tim. - [Children] Ooh! ♪ Tim and Cindy, sitting in a tree ♪ ♪ K-I-S-S-I-N-G ♪ ♪ First comes love ♪ ♪ Then comes marriage ♪ ♪ Then comes the baby in a baby carriage ♪ (gun firing) (glass shattering) - Alright, here's how I figure it. The kids, after we transfer 'em into the vans, we drive around till we get to the place where we're gonna hide 'em, and we do have to hide 'em. Where's Rick? - Mom made him stay at home, clean his room. - We're gonna do this Jim, is he in? (gun firing) (glass shattering) - He'll do anything I tell him. - Yeah? I'm telling you, he better. - He will. (loud gun firing) (glass shattering) So where could you hide them. I mean, where could you hold a bunch of kids until the ransoms delivered? How could you be sure that they're gonna stay put unless you're there yourself? - I am way ahead of you. (loud gun firing) (glass shattering) (slow paced music) - Come on back! Come on, come on back! Alright, watch your side. Watch it on the side! Alright good form, good form! Come on back! Come on back! - [Narrator] What's the matter darling? You've been blue. - It's nothing. - It's been nothing for three weeks now. Come on honey. - I hurt Tim's feelings. - [Mom] I thought you liked him? - I do, he asked me to the movies. - [Mom] That's nice. - I couldn't give him an answer. Bonnie and Wendy were there and they laughed at him. - Well you can still say yes if you want. - He's been avoiding me this whole time and summer school's almost over anyway. - You know, sometimes you feel like you'd never get another chance at anything. But you always do. Hey, I promise. - Thanks mom. (loud clanking) (creaking) - [Narrator] What's that? - The roof! - Come on Rick, let's get out of here! Get out! Hold on! Hold up, hold up! The dirt's gonna collapse the trailer! - What's the problem? - The dirt's gonna collapse the trailer. - Relax. - Relax? You go down there, I'm not going in there. - Get my toolbox. Go get some two-by-fours out of that lumber pile alright. Hurry up! (ominous music) Strong son of a gun for an old guy. I'll have to be on him. All the time. - You know, I'll be glad when summer school is out so that I can put a little more time in on this place. - You've been working it too hard on both ends. Maybe you should think about cutting back on the driving. - I hate to admit it but those kids are beginning to get on my nerves. They're getting sassier and louder every year. - Well you're getting older every year. - Older am I? Older? Come on, let's wrestle huh? - No Edward. (laughing) (ominous music) - [Little Boy] Oh you always get it! - Nuh uh, you got it yesterday! - Yeah, right after you took it from my hand. My turn! - No you got it yesterday! - Would you two stop it? - [Little Boy] Oh she started it! - I got it first! He's gonna take it away from me! - You know what? I have a good mind to take you both to the pound. I don't want to hear another peep out of either one of you. - Okay, shut the door. Perfect. Get those extra Jerry cans. We are three hours away. Man I can't taste the adrenaline. This is it! We can't miss! Come on, let's do it! We have planned it to perfection, it is foolproof. - Yes, we're really gonna do this aren't we? - Yes. - Yes! - Okay, he picks up those kids at the pool at 4 o'clock, let's move! You can't back out now. We're counting on you. You got your gun? - George Hill here we come. - Let's go. Don't bunch up. One at a time, one at a time, come on. Alright, here we go. Come on. Get up.

My Edward would never do anything to harm a child. Why he's driven you to school and your children. - Yeah, well you don't have a kid missing. You don't know how we feel. - Oh yes I do. I've got my husband missing. And he's as good and decent as any man alive. And you all better just pray to God how lucky you are that those children are with Edward. - [Jack] There he is. - Please, I have a statement. I've just been informed that the President of the United States has dispatched 50 FBI agents to Chowchilla. - What about you? What are you doing? - I know this is no ease to some of you, but we and the federal government are about to commence with the biggest manhunt in California history. - What have you found out? They've been gone for eight hours. Why? Why have they taken our children? Why? - We're working with everything we have. - [Narrator] They're doing nothing. - Why hasn't anything happening? - He'll be safe. He'll be fine.

Fred finds out he'll be mad. - You know, I never really dreamed we'd do this. Did you hear those kids screaming Jim? Did you? - They're kids. They'll get over it. They're probably-- - Jim, have you been watching the news! The whole federal government's involved! There's reporters from all over the world in Chowchilla! - Settle down damn it. It is perfect. It is perfect! It has been pulled off perfectly. - The hell it is. Perfect. - Okay. Alright, we'll take them some food later on. Not now. Not until it's after dark. It's too dangerous until then.

Little by little it's coming. - Here Edward. (creaking) - [Mrs. Rogers] Whoever is out there watching, please, please don't hurt my babies. - Ugh, turn off that TV. I can't hear anymore of that terrible news. Those poor children. Isn't that awful? - It's tragic.

Live from Chowchilla. - [Mom] You're not eating much Rick. - I'm just not hungry mom. - You look tired too dear. You get enough rest? - Probably too much rest. I want you boys to start doing more around here to help your mother. Is that understood? - Yes. Come on Rick, we gotta drive over to Fred's. - Fred, that young man. He's inherited everything from his family except their brains if you ask me. - Are you sure you're feeling all right darling? - Yeah, I'll be all right. I'm just feeling a little queasy. Can I be excused? - Excuse me. (faint whirring) - Get 'em on the ground. Be careful, be careful. It could still have some acid in it.

You get up Edward, don't you do this! - [Jim] Man, what if they can trace my handwriting? - They won't? We have to write a note. We can't get through on the phone's, all the phones are busy, we can't get through. - That's not how you spell ransom. R-A-N-S-O-M? - Yeah. - No, there's an E at the end. - No there isn't. - Sign the note Beelzebub. The name of the devil. That will really throw them off. - How you spell Beelzebub? - B-E-A-L-S-A bub okay? - Alright, "To whom it may concern, "your bus has been kidnapped. "We demand five million dollars in ransom "to be put into suitcases. "Use old bills, use a CHP plane, "drop off the... "We are Beelzebub." This is great. This is good. - That's good, and then what? - Okay, you guys will go up on top of the mountain. No wait, Jim you'll go up on top of the mountain and you'll hang out by those blinkers.
