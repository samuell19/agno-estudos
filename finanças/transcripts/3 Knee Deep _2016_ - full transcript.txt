So Ghost listen, I got it all set up. You name the price, we make the deal. - Who are the buyers? - They're offshore, way offshore. - Hm, that is a problem. How we know that these offshore entities will not come back to us trying to sell our own product with an elevated price? Wait a minute, first you told me you're getting out of the business. What the fuck is the matter with who's buying the shit? One ton of cocaine is a valuable commodity. 28 million dollars, one way too valuable to be sitting around in a steel vault. - Why not? - Woman, don't insult our friend Sammy. He's been a good friend for many years. And after all, Sammy would never double cross us, would you Sammy? - Ghost and Sammy, the fucking bull. You remember in Bangkok I caught a bullet for you, nothing has changed, never will. - That's very very true man, indeed. - I don't like this, Ghost. This is a deal you'll regret. Look woman, we're getting out of this business, both of us, this stupid cycle of kill and fight. We got better things to do with our lives. - Better than selling drugs and making money? I don't agree. - Quite enough of that. And I do agree. Sammy, you got yourself a deal man. - Thank you Ghost. Let's drink to a prosperous lucrative partnership. - If you'll excuse me, I think I'm going to get sick. - Victoria! - Jesus fucking Christ, what's her deal? - That girl, she got lots of ambition. That word will fuck up your game big time. At some point you got to realize it is time to fold up the tents and take the circus out of town. She still likes the circus. She'll get tired of it, trust me. ♪ Hey ♪ ♪ Hey ♪ - Victoria! You fucked up. - No, you did. Missing? What exactly does that mean missing? - What it means Mrs. Bradley is your client is gone and no one knows where he is. - Moses Jackson is not the type of man that just disappears unless someone wanted it to happen that way. - Um, what are you insinuating Mrs. Bradley? Mr. Jackson has been this department's number one profile target the last five years. - Your client is the number one target for every murder prosection that I could pin on his ass. Now if you'll excuse me, I have to track down this Ghost. That's so funny that now his condition matches his nickname. - Doesn't it strike you as strange that Victoria Constantine is missing as well? - Uh, you have your facts all wrong. The Russian police took her into custody. She's gone on a slow boat to Siberia. Now, show yourself out. - I'll be filing a complaint with the First Circuit court, the DA, and the US Attorney General, Chief Griffin. - Mrs. Bradley, pick a number and stand in line. And then go. Hey, get the freaking lock fixed! - You know, oh it's so nice to see you're peeing standing up now, Johnson. I need coffee! Oh, thank you. And who's messed with my Ric Flair action figure? If it was up your ass, you'd know it. - Fuck off. - Hey! Hey buddy, wake up! Hey buddy! Hey wake up! Get your ass up! - What the fuck is this? Fuck! - Bout time you get your black ass up. You know you smell like a god damn horse! - Hey, you watch that over there white man! - Look, we're in a world of shit buddy. And I don't have much time, so I wanna make this quick. I was in that club last night when that raid went down. - Who the fuck is this guy? - And here's the bad news, it wasn't the cops. - Okay then, who the fuck was it man? - I don't know who the hell it was! - Why the hell this fucking guy is right here? It wasn't the cops, god dammit! I gotta tell you how I know it wasn't the cops, you wanna know? Yeah! - 'Cause I'm Special Agent Neil Rogers FBI, that's how the fuck I know! - Oh, so you one of the pigs that put me away? And now you come and talk to me man about who fucking did this! Fuck you! - They took me when they took you and they brought us here! Where in the hell here is. I figure we're off the coast of Texas. That could be it, they're real. Hell I don't know, it may even be Kentucky, who the fuck knows? We're in a horse barn. Anyway, it doesn't matter. Here's the thing, they think I'm one of your gang bangers. - Bull shit! You, a fucking gang banger? Yeah, can you believe that shit? - Look at this guy here. That's funny white man. - Yeah, can you beat that? Yeah, they think I'm one of your gang bangers. And the other reason they're going through all this trouble is 'cause they know, and everybody in the world knows you got that ton of shit stashed away. - I don't have nothing, white man! Everybody in the world knows you got that ton of shit! - I'm just a poor black man in the world. - A ton of damn coke, and everybody wants it and they'll do any damn thing they can do to get it! You been set up buddy! You been set up big time. And they did a real good job, bro. - First of all, me not your bro. All right, you get that right white man. The name is Ghost, G-H-O-S-T. Get that right in your head man. - All right, you can play the tough guy now, sure. But I got a feeling you're not gonna be so tough, you're gonna be changing your tune whenever those assholes show back up here. - Fuck you mother fucker. - Yeah yeah, sure whatever. It's like this, the only way in hell we're ever gonna get out of here is we work together. Now, I don't wanna die. So here's what we're gonna do. I'm gonna help you and you're gonna cut me a slice of that coke money. And that's the deal, that's the deal there's no negotiating, you got it? - That's not a deal white man. I don't do that. For nobody. - Now look, I'm gonna tell these assholes when they come back that I'm your lawyer and I wanna cut a deal to get us out of here and when they agree you damn well be ready to give up that treasure map to that coke, you got it? You hear that? You hear that Mr. Ghost? They're coming man! Remember what I told you! God dammit! - What the fuck you looking at white man? Fuck you! Don't try it. What are you talking about man? What are you talking about? - Who do I have the pleasure of meeting? - I'm Neil Rogers. I am Mr. Ghost's attorney and I got a deal for you. I know what you want and I can get it for you if you'll listen to me. - Is that right? - Yes sir! - Horse shit. - No horse shit sir! I'm his lawyer, he'll do what I tell him! - Is that right? - You want the coke right? I can get you the coke. - Boys, I know who he is, he's a cop. - No, I'm not a cop! No! I'm not no damn cop, I'm a lawyer! I'm a lawyer dammit! I'm not a cop! I am not a god damn cop! Move your ass mother fucker! - It's a glorious day, isn't it Mr. Jackson? - What is this place, white man? - Oh, this is God's country sir. - Are you finished, or do you have a point? - You and I have matters to discuss. - I'm not discussing shit with you white man, now get me the fuck out of here! - This place could be an absolute paradise or it could be a living hell. I got two rules Mr. Jackson. Do as I say and don't piss me off. - I got two rules too. One, do not disrespect me. And number two, the name not Jackson, it's Ghost! - Horse shit. Looks like we got a failure to communicate here. Boys! Mr. Jackson, your ass is sitting on one ton of pure Columbian cocaine. I've got people interested in buying it. All you gotta do is cooperate. - I tell you little secret white man. You ain't getting shit! Let go of me you fuck! Put me down! That bitch! That fucking Russian bitch of his! I warned Ghost about her ass! Now look at him, sent away on a lifetime bid, this is bullshit! - Understood, but the fact is your ranting and raving isn't helping us. Look, there's one ton of cocaine out there somewhere and only Ghost knows where it is. - Is that the only fucking thing you can think about, Bercado? Money! Ghost is missing! That's priority number one fool, get your mind right! - I can round up some boys and track him down. - Yeah, and I could be reborn as a white Wall Street princess. Fucking Soup, act like you got a brain! Let sensible mother fuckers handle this conversation! Okay, Bercado we need plan. That is going to take some time. Time? Time? We don't have time! Ghost is missing! We got us a problem that needs a solution right the fuck now! - Did I hear somebody say solution? - Well look who it is, Nola Bradley our friendly neighborhood lawyer. The fuck you want? You here for your weekend payout? - Okay, nice to see you too Octavia. Okay, listen up children. I am betting the cops know where Ghost is but they won't say a damn thing. It's a set up. - No shit Sherlock. Why don't you come the fuck back when you have some useful information? - Okay Octavia, how about this? Our dear Russian friend, Victoria Constantine is missing. - That fucking white skank. I told Ghost we couldn't trust her ass! Look, one thing is apparent, whoever staged this shit, some sort of black box operations type. CIA, Secret Service, DEA, all those three letter pendejos who love to fuck with us hombres locos. Dirty mother fuckers. - Hm, but if it is the Feds, we're fucked and I mean times two. - Not if I'm on they asses. - You? Mrs. Nine to five, business suit, board meeting ass bitch? Child please. This gone take some grown mother fuckers to handle. - Uh, I don't care what grown people can do, Octavia. Fact is, we're going up against the government and last time I checked, very few mother fuckers have ever won that fight. Now I admit, you got your strong arm shit on lockdown. - Damn right. - But you gone need somebody working behind the scenes to find Ghost and getting through this shit alive. Now I've seen what the Feds have done to our people and it ain't pretty. So you want my help, or we just gone sit around debating who's the blackest mother fucker up in here? Oh, it's like that then? - Damn right. - Oh shit. Grown people just fell in love with your ass. Go on ahead and handle the business then. - Oh, I love when a plan can come together. So okay, I'll call when I find something. Oh, and good luck out there. Be careful out in those mean streets, they don't take prisoners. - You watch your back too, little mama. - Got it covered, chow. - Oh shit, time out. Hold on, hold the fuck on. Why didn't I think of this sooner? - What is it Bercado? - My cousin, Smiley might be able to help us. You know, little Smiley? Excuse me, how is that child going to help us? We need more muscle homes, not a pretty smile. No, we need brains to find out what the fuck is going on and Smiley graduated MIT at 16. Look, the Feds are sitting on a mountain of data out there in cyberspace, you know? And we need access to it. - Amigo, she's still wearing a training bra, bro. Are you fucking kidding me? Well, last year she made one million dollars manipulating the stock trades. Whoa, whoa, that little girl, the one that does all the cosplay and the comic conventions and shit, she made a million bucks last year? No, I only told you about the stock trades. I never mentioned the two million she made from investments. - Fuck me. I gotta get me a Bugs Bunny costume. And get with her. - Hello? Yes, yes I'm all right. No, what the fuck is going on? No, I can't wait! You listen, and listen good. Someone has been following me! You need to get me out of the country now! Now! - Freeze bitch, FBI. Put the phone down and get the fuck over here. Now! Come on bitch. You my dear, are under arrest. - Suggestions? - I understand this Ghost has a sister. Perhaps she can tell us where the cocaine is. - She is completely legitimate according to our information. She knows nothing. - Well, we won't know for sure until we talk to her. - Why don't we let this prick Cole, take care of Ghost? Did we not just have great discussion about plan A and plan B? The sister is plan C. - I think it will all turn out. - Yeah, I hope so because, - Right, because, - It's just always the same thing. - Right, a meeting, a meeting about a meeting. - I know right? Wasting time, I have so much other things to do. - Right, yeah I have a busy afternoon as well. - May we speak with you miss? - What is this about officers? - Is your name Ilene Jackson? Why, yes it is. - We have information about your brother, Moses. - You're gonna be okay girl? - Yeah, I'll be okay Mary. I'll meet you back at the office, okay? Okay. See ya later. Okay. - So you're saying this happened about half an hour ago? - Yes, I just know something is wrong about this. - Thank you very much for this, Mrs. Wilkes. - Call me Mary. Please, Officer Mason. - Why of course, Mary. - We're gonna need your cell phone for about an hour. Would you mind waiting in our waiting room? - Will do, not like I got anything going on, you know? Good old Mary Wilkes, work then home. Lots of free time, single. - Yes ma'am. - We'll see you shortly. - Okay, this is too weird. Look, word on the street has it that a couple of spooks from Laney have snatched Ghost. They're trying to get him to reveal the location of his legendary coke stash. - Great, just fucking great! Okay, what do you wanna do? - What I don't want is an all out gun war between the Feds and the Russians! - Look, if you wanna get paid then we have gotta do something, all right? That coke is our god damn ticket to the big time! Okay? And I am not going to give it up playing by the rules. - Well, well, well. The crime board is going through the roof and my two best cops are standing around fucking telling dirty jokes? Actually, we just solved the Kennedy assassination. You see, Lee Harvey Oswald was actually the pansy that he said he was. - Yep, three shooters, five bullets, one hit, one miss. - Boom. - Listen clowns, I just had my ass chewed out by the mayor. This Ghost thing is gonna blow up in my face. We have to do damage control, we have to find Ghost. Anyone think of checking the morgue? That's where low life's like Ghost usually end up. Very funny Riggs. - Hey, what about that high priced lawyer of his? - She's just as clueless as we are. She spent all morning yelling at me. "We have to find Ghost!" You know, she is going to sue half of Manhattan by the time she's done. - You ever think that that's the impression she's trying to give you? You know, she may know more than she's letting on. - You know? Now that I think about it, she was a too little over the top. Over the top usually indicates something beneath the bottom, Chief. - Mason, did you think that up all by yourself? Yes ma'am. - Well at least you're pretty. - Oh. Go talk to her and go find Ghost. And if I get another call from Internal Affairs about the two of you, you'll both be calling me to make duty. Fucking dismissed. - Yes ma'am. - Where's my fuck, all right. Mr. Jackson, where's the cocaine? I'm asking you where's the cocaine? I'm not playing games with you. I told you this would be a living hell. Where's the cocaine? - Fuck you! - That's not a good answer. One more. Stick it up your ass! - Fuck you. Fuck you! - You think the legals are fucking with your country, why don't you take a look at Wall Street. Sons of bitches fuck you while they're smiling in your face. Look Smiley, that's all very interesting but we really need your help, eh. - Hola, me llamo Smiley. Serena Sanchez to be exact. Look sister, we'd really like to stay and chat but can you help us? - Hm, my my. Ghost, legendary manifesto. Somewhere amongst all these scribblings Jackson holds directions to a shit ton of cocaine. Now that's exciting. I suppose you want me to try and decrypt it? Look sweet cheeks, we didn't come here to listen to all your geeky computer hacking stories! - No, I suppose not. When do you need it by? Right away Smiley. - Okay, it's gonna cost you. - How much? A Starbucks and a bagel with cream cheese. - Deal. - Oh my god, what is this place? This doesn't look like a police station to me. Where is Ghost? - I told you, I don't know. - We want to know where the Ghost is now! I told you, I don't know. - Victor, Victor. Too mean to her. I don't know. I don't know. I swear. - Where is the cocaine? Find it yourself! You fucker! - So it's an anagram? - I thought it was a pentagram. Well, whatever it is. A hologram or a mammogram. - What, do you even know what a mammogram is? Mammogram is for boobs, do that look like a boob-ogram? You're both wrong. This is a joke, it's a sick joke by one perverted Moses Jackson, the Ghost manifesto. The Ghost? Who? - No, you mean whom. The Ghost, Moses Jackson drug lord. Yes, Moses Jackson suspected in 16 murders, he's ordered dozens more. Born in Haiti, graduated with honors and got a Doctorate in Business from Stanford University. He has begun countless numbers of legitimate businesses, all of which were just a front for his cocaine operation which we have estimated is bringing in approximately five billion dollars a year. Yes, that's the Ghost and this god damn manifesto has been passed around the internet like a lottery ticket. But what does it mean? Maybe nothing, maybe everything. But word on the street that it contains, you know, the location of his hidden stash, one ton of cocaine. But why in the world would he do that? Because he's an over confident prick who wants people like us working on this shit while he perpetrates more crimes. Yeah, the first time we decoded it it was the directions to a McDonald's in Brooklyn. The second time we decoded it, it said, "You mother fuckers aren't very good at decoding are you?" And the third time we decoded it, it was a link to a website called "Fat Tits and Big Dicks." So we're not having too much success with this? No, not at all. This time we're gonna decode it, we're gonna get him. Yes? Yes. Thank you. The Russians are in town, ladies and gentleman and they have snatched Jackson's sister, Ilene. Bargaining chip, get Ghost to talk. No doubt, but I want you two out on the street. You get the girl, we will stay here and decode this mess. Good luck. Oh, I'm not gonna need good luck. I have the Russian cryptologist, Alexandria Kroznick coming to town. - The world's number one translator. And she's gonna be able to translate this? She better be, the CIA just spend two thousand dollars on a ticket from Siberia, as well as one damned expensive steak dinner. - Speaking of steak, I gotta go. I'll talk to you guys later. - What steak house did they take her to? - Dino's. - Can we go? - We sure can, let's put it on the expense account. I want you on it first thing this morning. We believe Ghost is being held by a ex military type by the name of Stanley Cole. He did three tours in Vietnam and he's pissed at the government. He owns a horse breeding farm he inherited from his uncle. He also has a small private military camp. - David Crash part two. - Don't take him lightly though. Don't take him lightly. His men are armed and dangerous and you're walking into a crab mine. Our goal is to get Ghost out, alive and untouched. Because all of the jurisdiction and red tape the Secretary of State told me if I send a team in, I'm fired. So I'm sending one person, you. - I'll do my best ma'am. - Do better and good luck. - Nice ass Riggs. - Clear. - Clear. - All right, now this is fucked up. Okay, Ghost doesn't operate like this. I didn't find an ounce of coke, only this petty weed shit. All right, and no guns either. Nothing! - Fuck, our sketch has never fucked us. - I guess there's a first time for everything. No shit. Hang on. Hey, what address did that fuck give us? 262 Monroe. Uh, okay. We just killed everyone at 626 Monroe! Do you mean, - Okay, just hang on. All right, we stage the guns, tip toe out of this bitch, and become each other's best alibi. We were off duty at Tommy's Pizzeria. You get me Riggs? - Yeah whatever. Come on look, let's just go. Come on. Dr. Kraznick. - I traveled here from Siberia and the steak at Dino's tasted like shit. Ugh, show me the document now! - Here they are. - I can't believe these mother fuckers still got Ghost, man. We don't even know who the fuck these mother fuckers are. I'm telling you, they're the fucking CIA man. I know it. This some mole man. Somebody's gotta know more than what the fuck they saying and I need to know who the fuck it is. - I hope you aren't pointing your finger at any of us. - Octavia, why are you always after us like that? Because it's a mole in the group man. Bercado, what about your fucking cousin? What if she's telling the mother fucking pigs our business? - She ain't got no fucking reason to do that. She got all the money she needs. No, no, it's not the pigs anyway. Look, they still been leaning on us. Leaning on the on's, you know? No, they don't know, they wanna know where Ghost is just as much as we do, eh? This is bigger than us man, this is bigger than us. - That's what it is. If it's someone dirty, then they wouldn't have them stashed somewhere official. No, we should get people out there looking at abandoned places, scouring the city for warehouses, foreclosures. Something, but all I know is we need to fucking find Ghost and we need to fucking find him now! That's the mother fucking priority. Comprende? We know this. We're racking our fucking brains here trying to think of something. You damn right. Ghost is important. We need to make sure we get these drugs and get this shit taken care of. Yeah Octavia, we're behind you. We know, we get it. - I don't think y'all understand. Oh. Hey, what the fuck? - Hey, watch your mouth young lady. - Yeah, or we might have to arrest you. - Where's your badges? We don't need any badges for you sweet chocolate. Oh, same old pig bullshit. I bet you love busting in protocol on black people, don't ya? That is a very unfair depiction of your police force. - Where's your ID? Bitch, whatever. - Bradley, Nola Bradley? Yeah, is something wrong? - Mason, you recognize that name? - Yes, yes I do Riggs. Nola Bradley, attorney for one Moses Jackson. Better known as the Ghost. Presently missing. And so what? - And you're gonna help us find him. Asshole owes us 10 dollars. - Uh, uh, uh, uh. I hope you guys get fired for this. - Yeah sure, move woman. - Hold on just a damn second. Hey, get out of here. You're both interfering with official police business. - Sir, I think you've got that backwards. You're interfering with official CIA business. Oh please, are those even real? We can do this the hard way or we can do it the easy way. CIA's calling the shots on this one. We're taking control of Mrs. Bradley as a matter of national security. - Oh, I'm so glad to see you. - Jurisdictional bullshit. Better luck next time. - Fuck, what now? - Mason, yeah. Yeah, okay thanks. - What is it? Please tell me it's good news. One of my people just saw two Russian types dragging Ilene Jackson into an old office building. - Ghost's sister? You gotta be fucking kidding me. - Nope, come on partner. - We have anything yet? - So Mrs. Cathy, you want this done quickly? - Yes I do. - You mean like right now, right? - That would be extremely helpful, yes. - Well, things done quickly are usually not done well. Patience is a virtue and in this case it is a requirement. Some advice, get me a coffee. It's going to be a long night. - Look, can I go now? I've told y'all everything that I know already. - I understand that, but we're not any closer to finding Ghost. - Look, save us the trouble of having you arrested and taken into custody. We're on the same side. - I have a client to protect, that has nothing to do with the same side. Now if you'll excuse me. - That wasn't very nice. - Hey, hey, hey. - Look, use my squad. Get your hands off me. - Don't think about it punta. - Bitch, you know what you're doing. - I know very well what the fuck I'm doing, pig. We ain't 5.0, we're the fucking CIA so you and your fellas might wanna think twice. Oh yeah? Jesus Octavia! You just shot more pigs? This is going to catch up to us one of these days. I know what the fuck I just did man, let's get out of here. - My name's Moses Jackson. My name's Moses Jackson. But they call me the Ghost. They call me the Ghost. Oh, I know why them call me the Ghost. Them call me the Ghost. Answer very simple. Answer simple, very simple. Now you see me, now you don't. - You're a slow learner. The fuck? The fuck? He's gone. Aw fuck. - Look, he's one man on foot, he's injured. You'll get him on foot. Get moving! Son of a bitch! Attention my boys. This is an all points bulletin from your number one super soul sister, White Chocolate. My fine white ass planted firmly in the command chair on top of mount hood. This just in, our dear neighbor this infamous Commander Cole has issued a 50 thousand dollar reward for the capture and return of the one Moses Jackson better known as Ghost. The suspect escaped from Commander Cole's compound early this morning, killing several of the Commander's men, just in general he's being a plain fucking nuisance. So since we're all quite familiar with his general description, I will not waste time with the specific details. You know who the Ghost is, what he represents, and how dangerous he can be. I will say this however, when he was last seen this 220 pound mountain of sin wheat African flesh was nearly nude, oh Jesus help me. Oh, my mouth and other orifices on my body are watering. Hm, hm, hm. My dear Mr. Ghost can it be that you are butt naked in the dark running around out there somewhere? Holy Jesus, come to mama. Oh, how I wish I was out there with you my brothers, searching for this wanted individual. I can think of nothing more exciting than chasing a naked black hunk with dreadlocks. Oh, that big black dick swinging into my mirror and darling even soul sister's every attention. I can't take it. Oh my, it's getting a little hot up in here. Now one last word my brothers. If you do catch him, remember one small thing. Bring that hot black ass mother fucker to me because one thing a mother like me loves is a mother fucker. Oh, yes I do. Now be proud my brothers, good hunting. This is your number one super soul sister on the pod, out. - Roger, Roger what the fuck's going on out there? Did you get him? Hello? Is anybody on this channel? Reggie, are you there Reggie? Reggie, you never could operate a fucking cell phone to save your life. Reggie! Anybody? Here comes Johnny J, I'm coming your way mother fucker. It takes more than one bullet to kill me. - And may me have the pleasure of knowing who you are? - Agent Donner, FBI. Get your hands up now. Where is Commander Cole? - Cole? Was that that fucking psycho that's been torturing me for two days now? - Yes, he wants that cocaine stash of yours, Jackson. - Not going to work for me. But I have an idea. How about I pay you to let me go, I get my coke, you get money. Everyone likes money Agent Donner. - What the fuck you talking about? - You are ranked 256 out of 257 in pay at your FBI field office. You see, while you have been keeping tabs on me, I have been researching you. They don't think very highly of you at the FBI. What about that daughter of yours, the one who needs the cancer operation? Oh, am I hitting home now, yeah. It's like this, you help me, your daughter lives. And that's a deal you can't say no to. But before we do anything else, me going take care of this white man and his boys up there and that is non negotiable. You wait here for me, I go deal with this situation then you fly back to New York. And we'll take care of that coke. - Shut the fuck up Jackson! - You could pastor all you want, you have no choice. Or you can shoot me in the back. And go save your daughter yourself. - I can't believe it. Yeah. Yeah we have a deal. - I'll be back. - Son of a bitch. - Okay mother fuckers. Look who's back. Come on, bring it on mother fucker! Yeah man, you got the debt and it's time to repay it. Say goodbye to the bad guy. - Ghost, you ready to handle business now? Uh, uh, uh. Not so fast Chief Griffin. Hand it over, nice and slow. - To tell you the truth, I thought I would've seen you a lot sooner than now Octavia. - Yeah well, guess I'm getting slow in my old age. I'm going to assume that this is about Ghost. - Right on target baby. Matter of fact, you got today's lottery numbers too? Jesus Christ Octavia, cut the shit. Yeah, let's. You and I both know what's on the line. - Yeah, your leader behind bars. Please, Diana. Stop all the goody two shoes shit. I think this Police Chief shit has gone to your head. You and I both fucking know Ghost ain't no criminal. Hell, you wanna see a criminal? Take yo ass to Washington DC. - No senator or congressman would sell dope and then shot someone just to make a fucking dollar. Oh, so you done got soft on me? Special Operatives Diana Barnes. Yeah, you know? Let's get something straight one fucking minute here. You know you and I done did a lot of shit back in the day together. I have no idea what you're talking about and that includes anybody listening to this fucking conversation. Look, you think I'm wearing a wire? Get a fucking clue. You and I got out of unit when we did because we figured that the government was fucking everybody for the almighty dollar, so while your boys in blue think Ghost is a criminal, I think he's a fucking revolutionary. And that's where you and I differ. What? So you gone side with these asshole pigs? You don't remember about Harry? You know they sent him over to Russia and when his cover got blown they left his ass fucking hanging. And those Russians gutted him like a fucking science experiment. Shut the fuck up, just shut up! This conversation is over. No the fuck it ain't, god dammit. I got a fucking favor and it's a big one. - Fuck that, you're going down just like Ghost when we catch him. See, you ungrateful ass bitch. You know, you know I'm the only reason your ass is alive when those black box bitches had your house fucking wired up like the Fourth of July? I was the one stopped them in they tracks before it went off. When you wanted to start your whole life over, who helped you get a brand new identity so you could come back to this tool bit ass town and be the honorable Police Chief Griffin? You fucking owe me and your bill is due. - All right. Tell me about it before I fucking change my mind. Call your boys off the street. Call them off for at least 48 hours so I can have enough time to find Ghost. And then that's it. - That's really it? Yeah, that's it. Then you could go back to your pretend life if you want to. You know, you got a lot of sins to pay for. Mine barely scratch the surface. - Octavia! I never did get to thank you for what you did for me. Thanks chica. - You can thank me by doing what the fuck I asked you. And you're welcome Diana. Oh now I see, yes! Yes! We got something? - You see Mrs. Cathy, the reason this document has been so hard to translate is because it is not a hidden message or a riddle or anything else. It is a mathematical formula and with just a few calculations. Oh she is done, success Mrs. Cathy. In 10 minutes, you will have your information. - Thank you! Hot damn you are worth every penny. - It was nothing. Now if you will excuse me, a bathroom break is long past due. - I understand, I understand. Hello? I think we've got him. Holy shit! The Ghost is ours. - What is it? - Kraznick just texted the information. She says she will take care of everything else. - We no longer need her. - Oh my god, somebody please. Please help me. Ghost, what have you done? What have you done Ghost? Somebody help me, please! Help me please! Please somebody help me! - Oh, oh fuck! Kraznick, how long before this thing wraps up? Well? What's that? You. - Okay, there it is. - The old Grigg's Warehouse? This can't be right. Why would he stash a ton of cocaine in such an obvious place? - Hiding in plain sight, that's my Ghost. - Si? Yeah sure. Octavia, it's for you. - Yeah? Yeah what? What? Where? Okay, get somebody on them. We're moving. - What is it? One of our snitches spotted Ghost. He was on a private roller at the airport. He had a female FBI agent with him. - It's party time. - Ghost baby! We got your back, step back pig. - It's okay Octavia. This okay, she helped me. In fact, she saved my life. - A Fed saved your life? I ain't heard about nothing. So what Ghost, you got this honey under your voodoo? - Nah, it ain't like that. I got a bigger goal in mind. - Senorita is here for the money. - You damn right. But for a reason you wouldn't understand. And we gonna do this or we gonna visit my whole life history? Oh snap. I like this sister. Real gangsta, okay then. Well Ghost says you're down then, so what's the play? The play is this, we got guests in there. We gotta make them welcome. - Shit dude, come on. Fucking monkey. Come on you little creep. Son of a, Fuck! - Mother fucker! Take your best shot! Fuck you! - Monkey, come on where the fuck? Mother! - I would say something clever, but me think I just shoot you. Hey Ghost, man one of them got away. No, me got that one. Okay, you two northeast corner under the floor there's a corner, you pop those locks, you find all the coke there. And hurry up, we need those trucks here we got about one hour before the cops show up even in this neighborhood. Move, move. - Got it boss. - I wanna thank you, you coulda killed me back at Cole's farm but you didn't. I appreciate it. That's all right baby girl. Even a cold heartless bastard like the Ghost will not let a child suffer. Besides, the FBI be owing you some money. - That's right. Let's go get some cash girl. - Yeah. - Yes sir. - Chief Griffin. - One second. Yes Mr. Mayor. We haven't heard anything, but we are on it. I promise we're gonna get this handled. I'll let you know as soon as I find something. Yes sir, yes sir absolutely, bye. Yeah? - Look, we got two dead Russians, Mason and Riggs shot dead. They found some cocaine on them, some small amounts so I'm guessing drug deal gone wrong. - Those two fucks. I figured they had started going down the path to being dirty. Uh, god dammit. What a media nightmare. Okay um, go back to the warehouse, case the joint, make sure everything's right and wrap it up while I try to stop this media nightmare and save my job from the mayor. - Chief, you really think this has nothing to do with the Ghost? - Well the Ghost has supposedly a ton of cocaine in a warehouse, but that warehouse, I don't think he'd keep something so uh, precious in something so close to the city. Honestly, I think he has that cocaine on some sweet island somewhere and if you ask me, he's on that same island drinking a bottle of Rum, counting his money, and laughing his ass off. - All right Chief, I'll wrap it up. All right, thanks. Dammit. Dammit. - Excuse me, Chief. What? - Can I get my money back from that god damn vending machine again? It keeps taking my money! - You know what? I've got two fucking nipples I will rub together for you 'cause I give a fuck. Get out! - You fucking kidding me? - Somebody come and get me some coffee! God dammit. And as they say that was that. We were able to get the drugs into a new warehouse in Jersey, get them cut up, distributed, and sold. So I can make my way out of this fucking business. Agent Donner's child recovered from her battle with cancer due to the money I was able to get to her. I'm a bad man, I've done many bad things in my life, but I also believe there is karma. And karma can be one mother fucking bitch. You do remember my dear, dear Victoria. The one who pledged me her allegiance and then tried to have me killed in order to get the coke. Victoria had a very unfortunate circumstance while waiting for trial in prison, she was found hung in her cell, an apparent suicide. At least that's what they say in the newspapers. Who am I to say otherwise? Then we come to the subject of me sister, Ilene. I had not seen Ilene for many years when she was killed by the Russians, but I also found out that she was a victim of a very conventional plot created by this man, a Russian Black Operative covered agent named Commander Kazorski. He is the one who hired Victoria and planted her in my crew as a mole. He is the one who contacted Commander Cole in order to torture me to try to get the information on the location of the coke. And he is the one who sent his agents, to kidnap Ilene in order to extort me, get me to talk, and eventually kill my sister. I have heard it said that revenge is a dish best served cold. Me don't believe that man. What me believe is, revenge should be fiery red hot like a nuclear reactor in a lake of gas fire. My anger is burning like fire, my vengeance shall be brutal. Just watch me work. Uh, you got a light? - Come on out now. - Yeah man, do you know what disrespect is? You killed my sister, that is the ultimate disrespect. On your way to hell, remember this. I am the Ghost, now you see me. Now you don't.
