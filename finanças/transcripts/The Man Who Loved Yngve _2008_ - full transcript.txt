Okay, everybody. Welcome. This is a wonderful area. Full of historical treasures. Imagine that people came over that mountain, saw the potential - - and thought: "Fishing opportunities, nice terrain, let's live here." Okay, come over here. Gather round in a circle. Stop, that's alright. Below here they cooked salmon in the middle ages. Yes! An underground oven. An underground oven! And over here there was a field, and there was a buzz of life. Okay. It's neither called EU or Russia. There's no war on terror. Nobody has an iPod. Cell phones, internet, that stuff is science fiction. You get me? No? Okay. It's 1989. It's called the EEC, and I'm fucking against it. It's called the Soviet Union, cold war and Thatcher. Norway has oil and yuppies, and people are walking around in pink down jackets - - with permanented mullets and they're listening to shitty music. - How many people lived here then? - Goddamnit. Now we'll make an experiment. Close your eyes. Imagine a sheep, a pig - - a farmer, walking around looking for food. - It's called self-supply - What did you say, Katrine? - Nothing. - It's called self supply. What did I do to deserve this? Everything's a joke. All the girls are going to the US as au pairs and they're gonna have a blast. Au pair? Goddamnit. I don't have any friends. I never had sex. I have no idea why I'm here. My name is Jarle Klepp, and I want a life. Shit. Fucking cunt trip. Sometimes life is so fucking meaningless. Where is the holy trinity? Cunt, rock and revolution? My name is Helge Ombo. Was your name Jarle? - Did you just start? - Two weeks ago. It's cool. - What are you listening to? - You probably don't know it. - The record's called "Psychocandy" - With The Jesus and Mary Chain. Do you know them? How about Raga Rockers? - My parent's plan was so convenient - Go to school and turn out like them But I'm a middle class boy who'll sacrifice himself for the scene. Now we have a lunch break. Get out your lunch boxes. She's pretty good looking, that Katrine. - I'd give my right arm for her. - And the left. Then what are you gonna jack off with? Your legs? You? Why don't we make a run for it? - A run for it? - Yes, damnit. Wait for me. To the future! Cunt, rock and revolution! THREE MONTHS LATER We're Mathias Rust Band. Eins, zwei, drei, satan! What's happening? Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando It's now, it's eleven o'clock Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando A true regime of terror Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando Now you know who we are Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando Get yourself a bullet and save your situation Cunt Satan Anarcho... Stop! - You're going too fast. - You're the one who's too slow! - Katrine? - It's just a childish song. - You should rise above that sort of thing. - But he's subversive. Katrine has a point. That cunt-shit is stupid. Should we rather be Sting-like and be called "Tea and Candles"? - You don't seem to get the point. - What do you mean? Me and Andreas think that it we are gonna get out of this practice room - - we need to stay away from the tacky love songs you hear on the boat to Denmark. - Does everything have to be so black and white? - Sorry, Katrine But no matter how feministic I am, you don't know the first thing about this. - The first thing? - What the fuck does that mean? - You're asking me what I think. - We've got a gig! If we want it. Supporting Mighty Dogfood. - At Folken. - Are you shitting us? - At Folken! - Supporting Mighty Dogfood! Damn. This band is going to rule the world. - We need posters now. - With a logo. - And badges. - And the coolest music video. Hop! - Fuck off, Rulle. - No. - Fuck off. I'm telling dad. - I have a right to be here as well. - You're not old enough. - Identification? Stop it, I'm 20. Come back when you get hair around the balls. - Come on... - He's been here before. - I had an inkling. - What? That no matter how much the Berlin Wall crumbles, we'll never get in. They can tell that we're not old enough. That Jarle bought his glasses for 2$. Fuck it. But soon the Mathias Rust Band is gonna take over this town. Yes. Cheers. - Can I join the band? - No. Look. The biggest cock in Stavanger! Rulle! Come have a look at your big brothers cock. You're so nice. Fuck... Wait a minute. Wait a minute, now. Okay... This is for you, Katrine I wrote a song. I was lost, so lost everything was tough and head winds I never thought anybody would tear down the wall Cause I was lost, so lost you weren't mine and I was nothing I never thought anybody could tear down the wall Cause there was a wall between happiness and me And then you tore down the wall Everlasting love Everlasting love There is going to be another verse. It's not quite done yet. - It was good. - Do you think so? Should I record it for you? It just needs to get it done first. It was a good song. I was lost, so lost everything was tough That's so good. - Are you spying on me? - Yeah. Play it again. - You can forget about that. - Come on. Is it for Katrine? She's nice. - You don't think I know? - You have to go to school. Wear your woolen socks. Have a nice day. MATHIAS RUST BAND AT FOLKEN THE 2. Just put it there. Well, folks. We have a new pupil in the class. Yngve Lima. - Hi. - Make him feel at home. Yes. If you'd asked any European at all - - if he thought the wall would crumble he'd have said: "never". "Not for a 100 years." But. But, but, but. Oops. - What did happen? Yes? - Fortunately the wall did fall. Communism failed, because the free markes is the healthiest system. - That's what Gorbachev is saying. - Communism never existed. - Communism is the goal. - The video channel is no. 9. - Unless it's been changed. - Okay... The TV-News last week. November 10. The world changed. There were so long lines that something had to be done. The East Berliners poured in... Hi. - For how long can you hold your breath? - Hold my breath? - Yes, I was holding my breath. - I have no idea. Should I time you? Okay. Are you ready? Now. 10. 20. 30. 40. 50. One minute. One minute two. Is that good? I'm just saying it's good they're organizing themselves. Are you gonna get som booze for the weekend? - Your dad doesn't keep track of his bottles - And now Helge is going to let loose? We could also have fun without drinking. You guys. It sounds like fun that you're going to play. You heard about my party, right? I did mention it, didn't I? - Are you already going out to practice? - No, I need to train first. Train? I just need to train. What's wrong with that? You're going to end up on the national squad. - Hi. - Hi. - Uh... - Can I help you with anything? Yes, I'm a friend of Yngve, and my chain came off. - Is this where Yngve lives? - You're not friends with Yngve. Come in. - Hi. - Hi. I was on my way to Helge but he wasn't home, so... My chain came off, so... I saw that you lived here and then I just wanted to say hi. What are you listening to? You probably don't know it. - Okay. Are you sure? - Don't you wanna wash up first? This is the best one. Come and sit down. - Who is it? - David Sylvian. Or, Japan. Tin Drum. Ghosts. - Japan? That's synthpop. - Listen to that. It's so cool. Look at this. I was on vacation in England. That's me and David Sylvian. - Really? - I met him in a mall. And then you said: "Hi, I'm Yngve from Norway." "Hello, I am Yngve." You're a good singer. You could sing in a band. I'm not... It's not for me, standing on a stage. But you know what? Did you ever see how the clouds look like things? There's all kinds of stuff up there. Dogs and cats. Humans. Everything. Look at that. What do you think it looks like? A rabbit, perhaps. Hi. - Are you bringing coffee? - I made tea. Tea sounds good. Are you having fun? Okay. We're downstairs. - Do you play? - Yeah, tennis. Cool. I mostly skate. I train quite a lot. - I train three times a week. - You do? - Do you wanna play some day? - Tennis? - Yeah? - Yeah... - You forgot it, Dad. - No way. Look. I have a soda here and... Call out for some food. I'll be back in a couple of hours. Now it's just you and me. How is Mom doing? - Fine. She's doing well. - Yeah, Sara always does well. I would have liked to see, how you live. But no. Yeah, yeah. - The rest of the weekend it's just the two of us. - I'm going out tonight anyway. - With some girls? - Girl singular. Katrine. Silent! Silent! Listen up. Silent! I wanna give a speech. Listen up. Now everything feels... Now everything feels very good. It's fucking cool. I'm so happy today. Rulle? Damn it. You're so wonderful. You? Did you ever regret? The two of us? I ran around after you for half a year. No, but... Sometimes it's like you're a pull-up-thingy. - A pull-up-thingy? - Yes... I'll give you pull-up-thingy. Do you think it'll be us for ever? Yes. - What is it? - Should we start playing tennis? Tennis?! In the name of our savior Jesus Christ, tennis? Did you get AIDS or something? I'm pretty sceptical. Are you going to the golf club? - You're afraid of being ridiculed. - Helge Ombo! How can you imagine that Helge Ombo wants to play tennis? It's mature. He dares change his opinion, you don't. Look. That looked pretty good. - That's so wack. - Hi. Are you in on the craziness? Are you going to be a judge? No... I just wanted to say that I'll be at the concert. Then you'll get a flyer. Is that the same kind of music as the Dire Straits? Yeah, Jarle is in many ways the Mark Knopfler of Stavanger. Are you going to be at the concert this saturday? Did you ever notice how the clouds look like things? It's true. There's all kinds of stuff up there. Dogs and cats and... Hi. Do you wanna borrow it? Japan! Cancer in the hands! Some bullshit synthesizer-pop. - How did it go with the bike? - Do you wanna stay and play tennis with us? I'd love to. Can anybody update me about the tennis opportunities here? Yngve is new at school, and I'm inviting him to tennis. What's the problem? We're just going to hit a ball around. Great. We'll see you. If you're staying we could play double. Double? "It's so strange, I think I landed on the wrong planet." The writer Obstfelder said that. And he damn sure didn't play tennis. Why didn't you say that? Yngve is the tennis guy. It was his idea. He's fucking good and fucking handsome. You're really good. - We have to do that again. - Yes. See you later. Do you have a crush on him or what? No, but when he plays tennis he looks like a Greek god. Maybe I should sleep with him. - Relax. Did I make you nervous? - No. Yeah, you did. I could see it in your face. Jarle? Helge is on the phone. I've gone to bed! ... but what the beast doesn't know ... - Jarle Klepp? - Yeah? Sit down. Cappuccino? Don't you know what that is? Coffee with a dash of AIDS. It was a joke. I meet quite a lot of people in this business. And honestly most of them just want to be filled with their own emptiness. What about you, Jarle? Are you empty? Sorry, I didn't see it till now. A divine light is emanating from you. Jarle is in love, right? Do you wanna be beautiful? Do you want Tom to make you beautiful? Yes. - You're so fucking conservative. - Damnit, George Michael. Do you think the singer of Mathias Rust Band can look like that? How cool. - It's pretty. - Stop it. As long as Katrine likes it. Are you going to sit with me on a Friday night? You don't have to go out every night. - There's lots of good things on TV. - Jarle? Is Derrick or Bergerac on today? Is Derrick on? Yes, Derrick's on. Is something wrong? What is it? I think I might be in love. I'm aware of that. But in two people at once. Two. I think, you should think twice before ... Katrine is someone really special. You know that, don't you? Yeah. I didn't see her in school today - - and it felt like she was gone. You've become more good-looking lately. Different. I'm happy you're mine. - Are you crying? - Yeah... What do you think? Tell me what you think. It's not tight or fresh. You're just playing for yourselves. You're not listening to each other - - and then it sounds like Kim Larsen on a binge. Maybe it's too early. Playing a gig. - I didn't want to create a bad mood. - Well, you're right, Katrine. But we're not giving up, are we? Are we? Adversity, right. If you get hit, what do you do? Lay down and cry like a brat? No. You get up. Every day after school it's out here. Every single day all week. Okay? Okay. Hi, beautiful. It was nice last time. - Is anything wrong? - I just wanted to make a tennis date. I can't before Wednesday. I have to go to Grandma's birthday. That's a shame. This band ... It could be fun to hear you some day. You sing, right? - Now? No. - Why not? - It's a bit hard without the band. - Come on. I was lost, so lost everything was tough and head winds I never thought anybody would tear down the wall - That's design. - It's really well made. - I'm glad you like it. - Mathias Rust Band! - You're 45 minutes late. - I had a flat tire. Sorry. I thought about something. We'll start with Cunt Satan. We have to show who we are. Mathias Rust Band. Now Jarle Klepp finally came to his senses. - Look what your girlfriend did. - Damn. That's good. I'm cold. Are you done with the song? I'm on it. It has to be good. Jarle? - Hi. - Good morning. Good morning. - You've had a new haircut. - Yes, Katrine did it. Is anything the matter? I lost my job. I was simply fired. - When? - Last week. - Why didn't you say anything? - You had a lot on your mind. They have to save money, do things more efficiently. So now I'm superfluous. But I got a good recommendation. It says I see all assignments as challenging - - that I'm a yes-person. - Mom! A recommendation? Would you like to stay home with me tonight? I'm so sorry. Office people ... Fucking capitalists. It's a tight business, isn't it? Lots of unemployed. I have to stay here with her tonight. - So I can't make practice. - That's alright. Lovely weather today. I have a parcel for Reidun Kristiansen. - Does she live here? - No, further up the street. - Up there? - 100 meters. You? Get a life. What are you doing Saturday? - We're playing a gig on Saturday. It'll be awesome. - What are you playing? - Take these and deliver them on your route. - I'lle see what I can do. Hi. What are you doing Saturday? Mathias Rust Band are playing a gig. Here you go. You'll be there on Saturday, right? Should I buy some chocolate for later? What's the name of that chocolate you like? I can't stay home all day. Well, we do have this gig coming up. We have to practice and I can't let down Helge and the others. - I think, you're getting better and better. - You do? Is that for me? Is it? It's one song I made and the rest is something I've taped. You can listen to it if you'd like. I often make mixtapes for people. Hi. - My mom went to bed. - She said you were at practice. - It's Dad... - Are you blaming him, now? I have to go. I'll see you at the concert on Saturday. Mixtape, huh? Do you make a lot of those at the moment? - Don't you think I see what's going on? - What do you mean? Mixtapes. Your father and mother. You only care about yourself. Don't you think I see? Why don't you just say it? - Say what? - That it's over, Jarle. Over? What are you talking about? The band! Mathias Rust Band. If you wanna let down the band and your mother and father - - and drink tea and listen to Sting, that's great, but at least tell me. - You're way off. - Everybody can see how you've changed. What's wrong with you? How did you know I was here? Are you following me or what? How many friends do you have, Jarle? And how many friends do I have? - Helge! - You're pushing it, Jarle. - Hi, it's Katrine. - It's me. - Did you talk with Helge? - Yeah. - What are you doing? - I'm playing tennis. - What about you mom? - Can I come see you? No. Helge's here. He's pretty upset. Christ. Well, it had to happen. Fucking efficiency. That job could never work out. You have to support her now. You're the one who's... Yeah. You and I. That was a great trip. Awesome trip. Do you remember? Do you remember how you cried to get that? I did? Now you're the man in the house. You have to support her. Yes. I am. There's just so much going on... I think I'm losing both the band and Katrine. In love with two ladies at once. That must be some kind of challenge. You have to think things through. The band isn't dissolved, and she hasn't left you yet. You have a lady to take care of. And you're going to lose your friends - - if you don't keep your appointments. I actually know what I'm talking about. Don't call Helge or Katrine to ask, when you should meet up. Say: "We have band practice tomorrow at seven. Tomorrow at seven." Then they'll be there. Look at this. - You don't have to. - I know. The weekend is coming up. And I am your dad. So say hello to mom, right? Tell her, that... It's good that we can help each other. What more can I do? Do you want me to clean the floor with my tongue? It's world domination or goodbye. Your choice. - Are you done goofing around? - Yes. Are you scared? Do you want dope or do you wanna die with no self respect? I sure as hell don't wanna die of drugs. - Did you write it down? - Yeah. - It's fucking evidence. - Relax. It's just the two of us here. - The two of us in jail. - Relax. Have a look at this. It's number 32. His name is Stegasen, and the mail box says S. Helgesen. - Hi? - Hi... Do you wanna buy a lottery ticket? - Do you even know his name? - Yeah, he's called Stegasen. I know that he lives near here in a white house. Christ, look around. Almost all the houses are white. Look, no. 42. You there. Come over here. - Is your dad at home? - Yes, he's in there. His name isn't Steinar or St?le or... - No, his name is Gustav. ... Stein or Svein, or? Let me take this. - You don't have a little 'shop' here? - No. - You don't sell plants or spices? - My dad's in construction. That's pretty much the same. 52, 32. 32, 52... Wait a minute. We could just drink beer. We don't have to become drug addicts this weekend. Do you want pot or do you want to die with no self respect? Stegas? Are you Stegasen? The Pot Man? Bingo Grass? Cirkus Greens? Weed? Magic Dust? Peter Pot? Are you a bit backwards? Are you yapping away by my door? Sorry about that. Do you have something to buy? Of course I do. But I need some help with something... - I'll just wait here. - No fucking way. Come out here. For fuck's sake. We smoked all of it. I'm Helge Ombo. You knew that that time on the trip. You spoke to me as if I were Helge Ombo. And I was. I still am. And you were Jarle Klepp. And you still are. Can I have some more bass in the monitor? I'd like some more of myself in the monitor. Hey, should we take Sloppy Joe? We'll take Sloppy Joe. What is this shit? - Do you think Mighty Dogfood liked us? - No. It's difficult, with the monitors and all. - Do you want to go for a walk or what? - I'll come along. Stay here and look after my bag. - Shall I just sit here and look after Jarle? - Yeah. MRB, MRB, MRB! COCK You guys smoked up. Damnit! - Fucking idiots. - We just tested it. - Testing, testing. - Cut it out, damnit. We're playing a gig! Don't be such a prick. Don't look at me. I just had a beer. We said we wouldn't smoke up. I fucking don't believe this. Jarle, damnit. Look at me. Do I look wasted? - Come on. Where are you going? - We had a deal. You're just upset that you didn't get to join in. Are you going to mope over that? We have a gig to play. - How many friends do you have, Helge? - With or without Rulle? Mea culpa, all the way to the bank. I fucked up, alright? I play drums from Heaven. I am the savior Helge Christ - - suffered under Pontius Pilate. Come on. Fucking... - Fucking kindergarten. - Me and you. What is going on? - What is it? - Nothing. Are you ready or what? It's crazy out there. It's totally full. Cool. - Okay, are you guys ready? - Yes, I am. Yeah, so am I. We're Mathias Rust Band, and this is Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando. Eins, zwei, drei, satan! What's happening? Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando It's now, it's eleven o'clock Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando A true regime of terror Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando Now you know who we are Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando Get yourself a bullet and save your situation Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando Radar Chaos Power Commando Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando Radar Chaos Power Commando How does it go? Are you reaping what you sow? Can you see what's going on when you're hanging upside down? Sloppy Joes up against the wall Sloppy Joes up against the wall How does it go... Give me my drumstick. Wait up, Jarle. That was the most embarrasing thing I ever was a part of. It was great, Jarle. You were fucking great. You were shining up there. - Do you think? - You were great. - What are you doing now? - I'm going home, I think. You're not going to that party everybody is talking about? - Are you? - Are you? Come and sit down, Andreas. Where did Rulle go? Damnit, what a bummer. Did you see how Dogfood looked? There's just one thing to do. Cheers. - Do you want a beer, Yngve? - No thanks. - You can have some red wine. - Yes, please. I thought the concert was great. Perhaps the other song didn't go too well, but the first was perfect. All the big bands had to fight for it. And you're cool. - It was great. - You're not too bad, Yngve. It was great you could come. There's drinks in the bar. And it was a great concert. - It's a really nice house. - Thank you. - And great music. - I'm glad you like it. Well, I have to go again. There's a party. Look here. - Hi. - Fucking great concert. We're fans. - Shut up! - Did you see them? They're probably shitting you. They're probably feminists. Come and dance, goddamnit. Come, Rulle! Birth-control pills. You can smoke them. - You wanna smoke birth-control pills? - Yeah. You just have to mix them in. Damnit. It says COCK on my forehead. Does it? Where? Damn you. Fuck it! Fucking idiots. Why didn't you say? - I thought it was on purpose. - On purpose? Like a kind of antidote to Cunt Satan. I thought it was kind of cool. CAPITALIST PIGS! MRB That's you, Jarle. I was lost, so lost everything was tough and head winds I never thought anybody could tear down the wall Cause there was a wall between happiness and me - What's that? - A tape, Jarle gave me. - You should have played it last night. - What are you trying to say? What is it you're saying? What the fuck's wrong with you? What is it you're trying to say? What's wrong with you? Say something! Or are you just going to look at clouds and play tennis? Do you think, I like playing tennis? Your pathetic white tennis socks. Japan. That fucking femi-synthpop shit. What the fuck's wrong with you? Are you gay or what? - I'm in love with you. - What? You heard me. I'm in love with you as well. Do you think I'm gay? For fuck's sake I have the best girlfriend in the world. - Yngve? - What's wrong with you? Do you know what you are? An arrogant, self-centred idiot. You're exactly like your dad. - What are you doing? - Fuck it! Shut up! Go to hell, all of you. - Katrine? - Yuck! Where are you going? Jarle? She's in the ninth grade. In the ninth grade? Fuck it. - What was Katrine doing here? - I don't know, Jarle. But Christ, Did I ...? Fuck. Oh, fuck. What did I do? - Mom! Go away. I'm in the bath. - You have a visitor. There ... There. My girl. What's happening here? Do you want to be alone? I've been so stupid. And that song... - Katrine. I don't think anything happened. - I don't know what I'm doing here. Katrine? You've been using me. You use big words, but you don't mean them. I believed in you. You said it was going to be the two of us. That's what you said... Did you see Yngve? You're incredible. You're fucking incredible! What's happening here, Jarle? I don't have a girlfriend anymore. Poor thing. What's happening? Is there someone else? Well, I'm in love, or... I think I was in love. In a... Jarle said you'd lost your job. That's horrible. I should never have... I bought flowers. Leave! We don't want you here! You're so fucking fake! Leave. Do you agree, Sara? That's what happens, when you smoke birth-control pills. - Shut up. - I think pot is overrated. Should I have called Katrine? It's probably a bit early. Did you see Yngve or speak to him? - Was he at school? - I think he was ill. Fuck it. I need to sleep for a year. Tell everybody that Jarle Klepp is an idiot. This is the homework for next week. Icelandic Sagas. But you... This is alright. Tomorrow you'll be alright again, right? Then we'll go out for a couple of beers. Then you'll be back on track again. That sounds good. See you. You're opening. - How is your mom doing? - She's doing well. She's tough, your mom. What about your dad? He pretends to be in charge of things. Like Rulle. Shouldn't you get a lady soon, Helge? You're not that ugly, after all. There's something I have to tell you. I'm quitting the band. Are you kidding me? We just got on the same page. - Are you kidding me? - No. And about Katrine... Just let it out. Do you think the same about me that she does? - I'm quitting the band, okay? - No. What is it? Tell me, what it is. Just tell me, what it is. Is it fucking difficult? - Actually, it is. - Well, I'm waiting. Well, you've been pretty absent lately. Right? And maybe Katrine needed somebody... And maybe that turned out to be me. What the fuck are you saying? Are you together or what? Cool down. Listen to what I'm telling you. - I'm so fucking fed up with you! - And I'm not fed up with you? All your political shit, that people believe you made up yourself. - You're just a copy of your mom and dad. - And what the hell are you? - You're just a bad copy of me! - Who the fuck do you think, you are? Look at yourself, Jarle! Don't you get it? You almost killed him! Listen! Don't you have a clue? Yngve is sick, Jarle. Hi. What a nice doll, you have. Next time I'm going to the big hoise, I'll get a new toy. Is Yngve home? Yngve is on the bridge. He's not allowed to. Mom says, Yngve is having headaches - - so he has to go on vacation in the big house. Are you Jarle? - Yes. - Mom says, you can't be here. - Is it okay for me to visit you? - Yes. It's nice here. - I didn't know... - It's great here. We go for a walk each friday. And there's bingo and football. And you can swim. - I should have know. - Do you want anything? - Lemonade? - Yeah. I was lost, so lost everything was tough and head winds I never thought anybody would tear down the wall Are you upset with me? Thanks a lot for the tape. I listen to it all the time. Do you wanna hear something? One day I saw a cloud over the town - - that looked like a dog running. It was barking and wagging its tail. But then all of the sky changed suddenly - - while the dog just jumped around up there. Jumped and jumped. But do you know what, Jarle? - It knows. - What? That it's over soon. It knows, that when the cloud dissolves, it's going to die. But you know what? While it's dying, it remembers that it used to be a dog. Look. That's me and David Sylvian. In England. - Don't you think I look stupid? - No. You look damn good. Do you want to play tennis on Wednesday? Yeah. I'm sorry. It didn't hurt. It didn't hurt. Hi. Do you think, there'll be a train or what? Of course there will. The Social Democrats are in power, right? - Shit. - Fuck! - What a lady, huh? - All the ladies of the world in one. We should start a band. Perhaps we could get Katrine to join. - In the band? - Yeah. But women in bands are often trouble. Yoko Ono. - Perhaps she could be our manager. - What should we call ourselves? I have a great name: Cunt Satan Anarcho Commando. I can't tell my mother that I play in Cunt... Of course you can. How about Mathias Rust Band? That's a great name. He was just a petit bourgeois West German with a pilot's certificate. I don't think, there'll be a train. There's a bus over there. Are you coming? Come on. It's leaving now. Come! Wait!
