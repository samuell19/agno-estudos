- Darkness and light. Evil and good. War and peace. Them and us. Everyone knows that one could not exist without the other. And between the two, there is a balance. Some say that before the lands disappeared, birds were able to migrate between the continents. They used a wind called uplift. You don't have to flap your wings to stay up, but you also don't fall. You stay in the middle effortlessly resting in the air. But there are no uplift winds anymore because we ruined the balance. The dinghy. - Here. - Hold on. Got it. Baines, up top. - Woo, look at 'em. - Status, Baines? - On winch. - It's a nine. 20 minutes to impact. Secure the genny. Cassidy? - Finishing on platform. - Did he say nine? - Hook it. Come on, Sully. Hook it. The net, the net. God damn it, Sully. - I got it. Get on the winch. - Five minutes to impact. Secure the doors. - Come on, Sully, leave it. - Fuck. - Sullivan, lets go. - We're fucked. - Thieving bastard. - It took two hours five from horizon to impact. - Doesn't leave much time to scavenge. If it gets any faster then- - If it gets faster, we get faster. - How about the fact that the storm was two days early? Any earlier and the relief boat won't have time to get out and back. - Assuming they see fit to send one. - We use the outboard. - We can't spare the diesel. Unless we cut our genny usage. Also, radiation levels are up so I suggest weekly iodine baths from today. - We're on our last barrel. If we go weekly, we'll be out of iodine in a month. What's that? Where's the fish? - We lost the catch. - It was right there on the platform. - Yeah, and then it wasn't. - You mean we have to eat this crap all month? - The good news is the storm cycle is getting shorter. - What happened, Sullivan? - I take full responsibility. - And that makes it better how? - Calm down, Baines. - We get one chance to get fresh food, real fucking food once a month, all he has to do is pull up a net. The storm pushes the fish into the net. There's no fishing required. I mean is it too much to ask? - You fucked my kitchen. All right? So how about you do your job before giving it all- - Do my job? Without my job you'd have no running water. I make the fucking water. Thank you, Baines. - You make the water. - Oh, what is it you do again? Fish? - Calm down, Baines. - I do my job, don't I? I row that deathtrap into a force nine to scavenge what I can to keep this shitcan from collapsing. - Enough. I'm still waiting on that damage report. - Ah, let me see. The desalinator? That's just blew. The genny is a crock. Erm, everything is rusted to shit. In other words, we're fucked. Do you want it in French? Fuckay. German? GeFookd. Spanish? I don't know it in Spanish. - I have every confidence you can fix it all, Baines. - Ah, okay, I'll put it this way. In case you haven't noticed, we're leaning at a 3.4 degree incline. And a massive chunk of the level one walkway is completely missing. How do you suggest I fix that? - Tape it off. - Tape it off. A warning ribbon, yes. Why didn't I think of that. - You have a better idea? - Yeah. We get the fuck out of here. When are we going to ask the Hub when the relief is coming? - The satellite- - Is for reporting events only. Yes, we get that. - They will inform us when they're ready. We all volunteered to be here. - For two years. Our shift was over three months ago. Establishing connection. Connection fully established. - So now, we're not even allowed to mention it? Thanks for sticking by me in the canteen. - Did I have a choice? - Oh, I fixed your mug. - Thanks. - What are they like, Sarge? I mean, you've been behind their lines, right? Before the great fuck up. - What's this? - Oh that? That's Peter. - Well, I don't like Peter. So whoever put him up can take him down. - Have a heart, Sarge, he was lost at sea. - It's a military outpost not a damn circus. - Yeah, once you get to know him- - Down. - He'll be on your conscience. If he has a conscience. Yo, Sarge. Right there. You see it? - Comms, check radar. Baines, to the roof. Cassidy, do you read? - I have it. Solid contact. Small, slow and steady. 1.9 Ks. - Yo, it's the boat. It's the relief. - Man the gun, Sullivan. Baines. - The gun? Sarge, that's the relief. - We don't know that. The gun. Baines, where are you? ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ ♪ And on that farm he had a dog ♪ - Sentinel calling vessel. Identify yourself. Sentinel to vessel. Identify yourself. - What's going on? - It's our boat. - Fuck, finally. So what are we doing? - His stupid protocol. - Contact. Radar bearing East 86, 1,800 metres. East 85. No engine reading. Still steady and slow. 1650 and closing. Sentinel calling. Respond. Sentinel to vessel, identify yourself. Sentinel to vessel. Respond. - Sullivan, get the dinghy. Go see. Use the outboard. - Alone? - If I say the word, don't you hesitate. He'll be as good as ready. - Hello. On deck. No sign of life. Anyone? - Sullivan, what's the score? Sullivan, report. Over. Ahoy. - Sullivan, status, come in? - Isn't that a bit premature? - Sullivan's not responding. - Sarge. - Key. - Oh brother. - Stand easy, Corporal. Sullivan? Sullivan, imperative you respond. Sullivan. Sullivan, we've gone live. Repeat, we've gone live. Imperative- - No one here. All clear. - Tow her back. - Sarge. My key. - Upon sighting unknown craft, the device will be armed. The protocol is explicit, Corporal. Hesitation not permissible. - What the hell's he thinking, waking Martha? - What do you expect? You stopped answering. - Fucking lunatic. - That engine's dead, kaput. - Okay. What about four kitbags, two years' supplies and five barrels of iodine, it's the relief. - Well I'm telling you, that engine hasn't worked in months. - What does that mean, huh? It's just been drifting? Is that even possible? And what about the crew? - Maybe it broke moorings before they boarded. - I guess we'll find out when we report it. - There'll be no report without more information. - What kind of information? - More. - More? We know nothing. Multiply that by 10 and it's still nothing. Other than blowing ourselves to kingdom come, our sole purpose is to report events, right? An empty boat turns up that's meant to be our relief is that not a fucking event? And if that's not a fucking event- - I'll let you know if there's a fucking event, Sullivan. After I've inspected the vessel and made my assessment. Baines, the boat. See if you can get some lights working on her. - What's he doing with both keys? How did that happen? You planning a trip? - Establishing connection. - Going to take that down? - Yeah, wouldn't want to miss that. - Connection fully established. Would not wanna miss that. Dropping connection. - What is it? - Beats me. - Well. Thanks for the mystery. - You ever think about the world down there? - What about it? - How it was. People, cities, life. Before the world was fucked up. - It's gone. Why lose sleep over it? - I don't know, to learn or- - Learn what? It's been one fuck up after another. One side fucked the climate, the other side fucked the sea. When there was nothing left to fuck up, we fucked each other up by fighting over the nothing that was left. And then, we inherit this shit. And what we do? Keep on fucking up. - There you go, you learn something. - The only way to unfuck the world is to wipe out the humans. The watch? - When we get back, you ever think about what you'll do? I was thinking that when we do get home- - Sully, come on. We don't even know when we're actually going. You know? - I did it. I sent a message. We'll find out tomorrow. - You angling to send a message? Establishing connection. - You did it already, didn't you? You did. Jesus. - Why is it still up there? What is this? A convention? You taken root, Baines? - Sullivan sent an inquiry about the relief. - Really? - He would've found out when the answer comes. - I told you I wanted more information first. - This is the only information that counts. - Connection fully established. - That can't be all. Hold on. - You sure you sent it? - Yeah, I'm sure, I'm not a fucking idiot. - Get to your posts. I'll deal with you all later. - Vessel arrived. Relief missing. Why are they telling us? Advise action. Isn't that what you asked them? - That's exactly what I asked them. That's my signal. Dropping connection. - How is that possible? - No one downloads it, so it comes back round. But why would no one download it? - Connection dropped. - It could be months, years since we lost contact. I mean what genius came up with this system? - It must be a faulty receiver at base. Maybe it went down yesterday and tomorrow they'll fix it. - How do we know there's been no attack? - You do know why this place was built here? Right here? - Yeah. Because back then it was the only place anyone could cross in time between the storms. But that shit was 40 years ago. I mean, you do realise that everything's changed? Tides, currents, jet streams. That boat just survived three months. If the boat can make it, maybe the enemy can. And who's to say they haven't? - Because they haven't. - I'm sorry. I'm sure they're fine. You're right, it went down yesterday and tomorrow they'll fix it. Fuck. Yo, Baines? Baines? - Out jumped a strange grinning creature with a concertina body and round bald head. Tin soldier. The tin soldier pretended not to hear but he blushed as red as his uniform Staring at our princess. Just you wait till tomorrow. Haaaaa And the jack disappeared back into his box with a squawking laugh. The next morning, the little boy set out his soldiers.... - Where've you been? - Taking a walk. - With your tools? - Well if I had a dog, I'd walk the dog. Stay. - Any plans to fix the galley sink? - Then I wouldn't get to watch you carrying buckets. - Fuck you. With bows on. Asshole. - Sullivan. - Okay, but what does your Elizabeth say? - The same. She never believed in all that stuff. About an enemy waiting to cross. It doesn't make much sense when you think about it. I mean we haven't seen them in 40 years. They're probably all gone. - Well why would they send us here if there's no one out there? - It's the threat, Liz says they use the threat of danger to keep us in line. - They used to be there. - Yeah, they did. She says we wiped them out years ago. Or the sea done it for us. - She says a lot your old lady. - Yeah. She's pretty smart. - What if they think we detonated? - They don't. - No, if the satellite is bust and they aint getting our messages- - Martha is 20 megatons. The tsunami she kicks up would hit both continents. More than hit. Smash. - Wait, wait. Martha's tiny compared to the first two- - It doesn't need to be big. The earth's a different place now. The axis has shifted, the sea's risen. It wouldn't take much. - So it could actually destroy us and horses, and dogs- - And cats. - Cats. And swallows? - Sully. - I mean, sweet swooping swallows. - Listen. - Man they don't deserve that. I mean haven't we screwed up enough already? - Sully. - And he got both keys. - Can we just stop talking about this now. - To the last device in the world. - Sully, listen to me. Listen to me. What if, hypothetically, that boat could work? - Jesus, Sully. - Ever heard of Mornington? - Who? - No, no, a place. They've still got electrics, running water, even a sewage plant. - Mornington. - Yeah. - Great. Let's talk about it in the morning. I need sleep. - What if I told you that the boat worked? I mean, the boat could still work. - Baines is fixing it? - Well, if he asks, I ain't tell you shit. - Has he done it or not? - I mean, it's a work in progress. We have to leave within the next three days. That'll give us 14 days to get home before the next storm hits. So all we need to do is convince Hendrichs. I mean we're going home, Cass. - Hendrichs will never go for this. - Hendrichs can come or stay, his call. But we are going. I mean, a couple of weeks from now we'll be sat in that great stinking port, eating goat steak. I mean, what do you say to that? - On my signal, not before, not after. Or you'll have my hand off, okay? You ready? Three. Two. Now. Again. Now. Hendrichs. - You just leave the talking to me. - Excellent work. - Well, what can we say. - Now, break it up. I want everything stripped by sundown. Electrics, engine, nuts and bolts, decking. Everything that's not hull. Start with the engine. - No fucking way. - Look, it's a working boat, Sarge. - We need the parts. - Sarge, that fuel injector is held together by quarter mil copper wire, if it's moved one inch- - The engine is not the point. We only have one chance. If we leave by tomorrow, we beat the storm. If not, then we lose the boat for good. - That's why we're dismantling her. - I vote we go. - You don't get to vote, Sullivan. - Baines? Cassidy? We're not dying for you. Not like the others. - New orders. Cassidy, Comms. Sullivan, winch. Baines, stow the salvage. - Or what? - Fuck. - You have the amazing ability of saying the wrong thing at the wrong time. What do you expect? - Fuck him, we'll take it anyway. - Sullivan, where are you? Man the winch. - That's our boat and we're not losing it. Not to that power-crazy- - It's not about power. - He took both keys. - What's taking so long? - I'll deal with it. - Did you know? - Hypothetically. - Your duty is to inform me of mutiny. - Come on, Sarge, it's not a mutiny. They need to understand their orders. Can you honestly say you stopped them for the right reason? - Our job is to protect the device, not run like rats. Right reason enough for you? Make yourself useful. Clear out the wheelhouse. - I'm sorry you lost your squad, Sergeant. - What's that got to do with anything? - Those other men aren't ever coming back. Don't lose two more. - We're not killing anyone. - Did I say kill? We jump. We jump him. We need to leave here by tomorrow. So unless you have something better to do, like talk or vote, he could just walk in here and shoot us. - Would you be able to disable Martha? - Jesus, he's not going to- - There's no telling what crazy shit he might do. - I don't know. It would take... What are we even talking about? Are you listening to me? We need to be out of here tomorrow. If we don't leave by tomorrow he... - Drinking on duty, Baines? - No, it's not even open. - In that case, at least you could share. Get some glasses. Corporal Cassidy deems it imperative to send a report home. By boat. I am minded to agree. That said, it goes without saying we can't abandon our post. So, we split up. Two go and one stays with me. - Who? - The boat will deliver our report to the Hub and send back the relief or else return with information and supplies. - Yeah, who? Who goes, who stays with you? - Corporal Cassidy volunteered to remain. You pack two weeks' supplies. You leave tomorrow if there's no new signal. - What was that? Cass? You said you'd talk to him. - I did. You got what you wanted. Take the boat, go home. - You can't stay here alone with him. - The rig needs at least two to keep it running. - I'm not leaving without you. What is it? You've been on edge for months. - We're soldiers. - Stop being a fucking soldier for one minute. - Why are you here, Sullivan? - What? - Here, on this post. You volunteered. - Oh come on. Don't make like this is some heroic national duty. Truth, loyalty, sacrifice. That shit belongs on the toilet wall. We didn't come here to die. We came for the cash. And we signed up to put our lives on the line for two years. Two. And we kept our side. I'll stay. You go. - You don't get a say. - I'm not leaving you here. - Sully, whatever you think you feel- - Whatever I think I feel? I won't let you- - Go pack. Jesus. - Don't you wanna go home? You. Don't you wanna see them? I know you wanna go back. You must. Then let's both stay. - I don't love you, Sullivan. If that's what you wanna hear. You were a human necessity. An easy lay. - They're like us. You asked me what they are like. They have families and children, they eat and shit, and they pray one day all this will end. The only difference between us and them is they're trying to kill us and we're trying to kill them. And that's not even a difference. - We could all go, Sarge. No one's coming. Not ours or theirs. - We can't know that. We have something they don't, Sullivan. Our duty is to keep it that way. I'm sorry you have to leave Cassidy. - You knew? - I know everything, Sullivan. Rest up, both of you. - Is everything okay, Sarge? - Oh sweet Jesus. - Action stations. Man the gun. - How far are they? Maybe we can outrun them in the boat. - Left four degrees, 600 metres, bearing 186. - 600. Shit, I can't see a thing. Cass, what you got? - Sentinel calling vessel. - How'd it get so near with no-one picking it up? - Right one, hold elevation. Elevation three. Ready. - Should we find out who they are before firing, Sarge? - Not this time. Fire. Miss. Reload. - Fuck. - Repeat. Sentinel calling vessel. Respond - Left two, up one. - Up? It's heading away? - Fuck. It's our boat. - Fire. - It's our boat. - Take your post. Fire Fire, Baines, fire. - Our boat? Quick, grab the tender. Hendrichs, are you fucking insane? - Sarge, the boat. - Time to choose sides, corporal. Right one, hold elevation. - Do it, Baines. - Don't you touch that, Sully. - Move away, Sullivan. Baines, take your post. Fire on my command. Step back. Last chance, Baines. Fire now, or I will. Baines. - Are you all right? - Where is he? - Store room. - I'm gonna kill him. - Wait, stop. No, hey, Baines, no no no. Hey, no. - Hey, hey. - You're okay, you're fine. Shit. Dropping connection. Connection dropped. - And we need to move from staggered six hour shifts to eight hours, with two on and one off. Until Hendrichs is- - We're not letting him out. - He needs the iodine bath. - We are not letting him out. - Okay. And- - And I quit. - I guess that means 12 hour shifts with one on and one off. We try to contact home. Maybe it's only 625 that's blocked. We'll give the other channels a go. One a day, starting at 001. - There's a thousand channels, we'll be at it three years. - We're not exactly going anywhere. - Sully, those things I said, I really wanted you to go on the boat. To get home safe. Don't punish me for that. - Why? Why change your mind about us going? - I'm here for the same reasons you are, Sullivan. - Cash? - We both know you won't be seeing any money. You traded four years in the can for two years in this place. That was your deal. And I'm here because it's the only command they would give me. We're both here to atone our sins, and earn a second chance. - Enjoy your meal. - The boat was here three months ago. I recreated the route from the e-log. They got to 10 miles due east, changed course, away from us. The engine stopped five miles north. After that, they were drifting. There are two questions now. Why didn't we see it, and why did the boat change course if all they had to do was follow our beacon. - What the fuck are you talking about? - Here we are, and here they come. 4.38 they start to change course and half an hour later they stop here. It's a curve. A curve, you understand? - No. - It means they didn't change course once, they kept changing. And then they stopped here. Why stop? Unless they thought they'd arrived. - Why didn't you tell us last night? Why blow up the boat? Why didn't you tell us? Unless this is what you wanted? To keep us here. Because you think one of us has something to do with it? - Whatever happens Sullivan we have to make sure that they won't get their hands on the device. You have to get me out, Sully. - That was a hell of a blow you took to the head, Sarge. - Sully, you have to get me out. Dropping connection. Connection dropped. - You look happy. - That's not me. I'm the grumpy girl there. That's my brother and those are my parents. One day a photographer was coming to our local pier. Taking photos for cash or exchange. It was raining. I wanted the bigger umbrella that my brother had and those little blue boots. So, here I am protesting the unfairness of it all. And this is the only photo of us ever taken. The next year I was sent away to school. And there was an enemy raid. And they were all killed. - All I remember from my childhood was the constant heat. Never rain. There are a lot of things I don't remember. - Jesus. Are you okay? - Together we seek better and more sustainable ways forward. - What? How much have you had to drink? - This is a promise we give to our future. - Baines, what are you... - Get off me. Get off. What the fuck. What the fuck, Baines. Sober up. Sully, it's Baines, he's lost it. - You all right? - We reach towards the summit of possibility to make the best for the most using the least. - He just needs to sober up, okay? - With purity of form and clarity of purpose being constant in our ideals and trustful in our mission. - No. - Were making elegance meet innovation and simplicity from this day until the last. This is our vision. Simple, stylish, comfortable, elegant, innovative. Teamwork is the essence of the BORG culture. Together, creative, hopeful, we share a common goal. - This is not a common goal, buddy. - Can you imagine how many shades of fabric they have? 27. Do you know who started it? Mart. In Estonia. It was a country. A small country. There were a lot of them. - Yeah. - Big and small. - That's good to know, pal. - Baines. - You don't care about history. - I do, Baines. Me and Cass, we were just talking about that earlier. But let's not make history today, hmm? Wait, wait wait. Listen, listen Baines. This is no way to go. What about Liz, hmm? Of all the dumb ways to go, what would Liz say to this? Let's leave Martha alone. Hey man, we all deserve better. - Baines. - Okay, man. Hey. Hey, it's okay. Hey, hey, Baines, man, it's all right. It's okay. - I forgot the last number. - It's okay. It's okay. I'm letting Hendrichs out. - He's gone. - What do you mean? - I wanted to kill him, but he was already gone. Did it to himself. Establishing connection. - Storm front incoming. ETA three hours to full contact. - It's two days early. - That's what it does. It changes. Possible salvage, due north west. - Alone? - We need the material. - You seen this? - He's back. Fixing things. - I'll drive. - It may do him some good. - She was pregnant. Liz. She was six months in when I left. I don't even know if it's a boy or a girl. Sully, I wanted to- - No, save it. Go. Go salvage some useful shit before I blow you up. And look after her, hmm? Oh, yeah. It's okay. Bring me something nice. - Sully, I did it. - You fixed the sink? - Sink? Fixed that a week ago. - Mother fucker. - Cats, horses, swallows. - Just in case. - I don't like it, Sarge, it should be right here. It must have gone. - If it'd gone, there'd be no signal. - Sarge. - Hello? Are you okay? Hello. Hello? Are you okay? - Sully. I begged him. He climbed off across the plastic and he wouldn't come back. I'm sorry. Sully? Sully? Sully, I'm sorry I slept in. Come in, are you there? That thing you gave me. The metal globe. I think I figured out what it is. It's funny, you'll like it. Sully? Sully? Sullivan? I'm here. It was his third tour out here. Hendrichs. He wanted to stay. Put that in his report. Asking for another shift. He didn't want to leave. - Sully, his mental state was so unpredictable. You saw what happened to him. - What did happen to him? He didn't kill himself. But you know that. Don't you? And the relief crew? I know it was you. I know why you're here. Sullivan. Sullivan, what do you mean? I don't understand. - I can't let you have it. - Let me have what? Sullivan. What are you doing? I don't understand. - Just stop. - Stop what? - It's over. You really played me. - Sully. - Hooked me like a big dumb fish. - No. - It never rained on our side. - I hated lying to you. Sully, listen to me. - Don't. - My homeland is sinking. My people will perish if I didn't get hold of that thing. All I want is to end their suffering. - So that someone else would suffer instead? No one should have it. Not your people, not mine. No one. Sully. - Like you said, Cass. We just keep on fucking up. - That's how it is. - It doesn't have to be. - What? - Baines. We're not leaning anymore. - No. And we're still here. - So what now? - Now it's up to us. - And if someone comes? - Yours? - Or yours. - Then we protect the swallows. Together. And with everything we have. - So, what is it?
