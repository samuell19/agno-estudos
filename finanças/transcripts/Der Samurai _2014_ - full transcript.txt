Did you see anything? I didn't dare come out. The dog was barking so. What did you see? Sorry, he doesn't usually do that. It's the wolf, isn't it? Could have been a raccoon. I hear it howling in the woods at night! Raffi, come here! Step it up! We're not at a gay parade! The butcher called. Why? He was wondering what you need all the meat for. It's part of my strategy. Be honest with me. Are you making friends with a wolf? Is that your strategy? I just keep it away from the houses. And what happens if you stop feeding it? Think it'll just leave? What's this? "To The Lonely Wolf c/o Jakob Wolski" Are you the post office now, too? Evening, officer. How's law and order? Fine if you all behave. Are you coming to the party later? I'm busy. Shame. Is it true that you have a gun? Yes. At the station. - Cool. Have you ever shot someone? - Jakob has never fired his pistol. Can you ride? Sure. Then I'd ask you to take a backseat. Are you sure you want that? It doesn't matter what I want. You have been drinking. You can't ride. Well, we don't want you pulling out your gun, do we? Ride carefully. - We'll swap seats, anyway. Not if I catch you! What do I do now? Play a seven. Or draw two. Wolski speaking. "Is that the police?" I'm not at the station anymore. What can I do for you? "Has the parcel arrived?" Yes, a parcel has arrived. "Have you opened it?" Was I supposed to? "No. It's for me." - Would you kindly tell me your name? -"It's on the parcel." I'll have to hear you say it. You could be anyone. Why did you have it sent to me, anyway? Hello? Listen, if you won't talk I'll have to end the conversation. Good night. -"Wait!" Yes? -"Do you hear that?" - Hear what? "That sound." "it's the wolf." Is it with you? Yes. It's out here. What's your address? Hello? Hello? Like what you see? Hello. Wolski. We spoke on the phone. Don't worry about the wolf. It's already gone. Were you planning on going out? I hear there's a party tonight. I'd think twice about that if I were you. - Why? I don't mean to be rude, but... you won't have it easy around here, looking like that. I've brought your parcel. You didn't answer me on the phone. Why didn't you have it sent directly to you? This isn't my house. Then what are you doing here? I was looking for something to wear. What's your name? You're trespassing! I'll have to ask you to leave the premises at once. Otherwise I will have to arrest you. - All right, then. - Shhhhh... Did you not understand me? Hello? Stay where you are! What the hell? Stay where you are! Is this your strategy? Hello? Are you hurt? That was fun, wasn't it? Who is it? Me again, Wolski. Police. Why has Raffi stopped barking? Wasn't your husband a hunter? Why? - Have you still got his riﬂe? Who is it? Stop it! Put down your weapon and come with me. Are you deaf? I said stop it! Stop or I'll shoot! Are you ready? - For what? The baptism. Crap. Come on, come on! Don't worry! Police. Hello! Looking for someone? Sorry. Do you need help? The tread was quite worn out. I thought it would do it. Get in the car. - What? Get in the car and lock the door! -Why? Stop hiding and show yourself! Do you need a lift when you're done here? Are you on duty? I've no idea. If that's so... I'd meant to be over the border already. There are still wolves in Eastern Europe, you know? Are you from around here? - I grew up here, yes. Wow. Must be terrible. Why? I don't know. The people? Everybody knows everybody. Everybody making sure no one steps out of line. Did you never want to leave? I like it here. Bet you live with your parents, too! - They're dead. Shit. I'm sorry. I care for my grandmother. You don't get out much, do you? There's plenty to do. And without you everything falls apart, right? Don't you need to get out? Good luck, Lonely Wolf! - Why do you call me that? I don't know. Because it fits. Hey, pal! This is my beat. If you don't stop or go away, you won't get rid of me. Simple as that. The problem is easily solved You could have had that earlier. All right. I'll stop. But you have to do something for me, too. What's that? The bird. What about it? It has to go. Why? What did it do? It's so damn ugly. Are you afraid of the people? Okay, Okay, I got it! See? They won't come out! It's the bird that bothers you, right? I hope you realise that this is madness. I think it's dead. -It's faking! And where are you headed now? We could still go dancing. No kidding. What? What is it? I pictured you differently. Pictured me? How? Different. Bolder. Isn't it about time you told me what your little crusade is all about? Imagine this scenario: You'd gotten off work today, like any other day. You'd wanted to go to bed early. But then you did go out again, after all... Without knowing why you'd gone to the party. You'd stood in a corner drinking Coke, watching... waiting for something without knowing what. Imagine you'd met me there. At first you'd only have seen me from afar, but even from a distance you'd have known me. You'd have bought me a drink, we would have stood facing each other, clumsily exchanging a few words, and then we would have danced to a tune no one else was dancing to. Can you imagine that? No. See? That's how narrow your prison is. What prison? Why would I want to imagine such a thing? See how powerful we could be together? Hello? "You aren't wearing a dress, are you?" No. Of course not. "I'm getting calls about a transvestite wreaking havoc in the streets." Yeah, I got it under control. I just arrested him. -"You did?" - Yes. He's right next to me. "Can I talk to him for a second?" Don't you trust me? Now for some answers. Firstly, what is your name? Lonely Wolf it is, then. Mr Wolf. Secondly, where do you come from? There are great facilities for special personalities like you. Maybe you're being missed already. And thirdly, what do you want from me? Maybe it's time you started asking other questions. Like what? Why did you feed the wolf? Why does Jakob deliver a sword to a complete stranger at the dead of night? Or, why did our chat get your juices ﬂowing so? Better now? Does that turn you on? Where do you think you're going? We're not done here! Jakob! Coming! Good evening. I wanted to see your grandson. He's not home yet. Would you like to wait for him? What do I have to do now? Draw two. And now? Draw four. And now? Draw eight. Hurry up. I can't! My hand! Do you want me to cut it off? Hurry... up! Who are you? What do you want from me? Such a good boy. Grandma! Gran, it's okay, it's me. Jakob. Are you okay? Go away! It's me! - Don't touch me! You're not my grandson. You're not Jakob! What's going on here? Halloween? Leave him alone! What is this crap? You are dogs. Stop! Leave him in peace! Jakob, dude! Easy! We won't hurt him, we just want to talk. Leave him and go home! He's dangerous! We've got this under control! Go home and sleep. You're done for the day. Let me through! Give him hell, boys! He's got a sword! "You are calling outside business hours. Leave a message, we will return your call." "In case of an emergency, please call 911." "it is now almost 4 am." "A time which finds most people peacefully asleep." "Not me." "You know why not?" "Here's why." "You hear that?" "And now tell me, why do I have to hear that?" Hello? Hello?!? What's going on? Jakob! Who is that guy? Wait! Stop it. Or do you want me to break my neck? Sorry. Kill him! - Where is he? - How the hell should I know? What are you waiting for? Backup is on the way. -I know how I can distract him. - What are you doing? I know what I'm doing. Have you lost your mind? I had to start without you. Easy, Jakob, easy. We've got everything under control. Look closely. These are the miscreants. They are like corks to our bodies, keep the spirit bottled in. It is our duty to get rid of the blockage once and for all. Enough! Empty cages, nothing more. They cannot hold us back any more. Shall this be the end? What do we do now? I still owe you a dance. What's wrong? Nothing. I left him for you. What's the matter? Can't you dance if he watches? It wouldn't have worked anyway. Come. Let's not wait any longer. What an ugly little cork you are. Take the sword! What is wrong? I can't. Why not? He is innocent. They are all innocent. How will you dance with me if you won't learn the steps? It's me you want. I fed the wolf. I summoned you. Sol will come with you. But you have to let him live. How do I know you're sincere? There. See? I'm yours. Jakob,Jakob,Jakob... You should've killed me when you could. Drop the weapon! Drop it! Don't shoot! I've got him! I've got it under control! You are a coward, Lonely Wolf. Why are you here? - What's up? What's going on? And the wolf... where did it come from? Does it hurt? What a nightmare! Who'd expects this when starting a shift? I've no idea how you got through all that alone. Careful! Everything all right? "Animal on the road." Freeze! Oh, shit! Stay right here.
