THE ORIYINALS Hi, baby. Do you want to take a little walk in my car? Wait a minute. You are Argentinian? No way! I love your accent! - Really? - I know! Besides, I love cars and adrenaline! What a coincidence! My name is Natalia. Hello Naty! Look at those legs! You know what... I think is better... if you go in the back seat. - Ok... - You can be more comfortable. Come in! What an idiot! Still dreaming! This is one of many examples to sketch a little, what this movie is about. From this moment not everything you see is what it is. And not everything that is is what you see. You got it? Alright, you already understand. For now prepare the popcorn, be comfortable, and enjoy. The situation are very bad... AN "EXCELLENT" BOY it's impossible to raise these kids, with the things they see on the streets. - Hi Raul. - Hi Raul. Too many thieves, mobsters, dealers poor kids! Besides, the streets are destroyed. They can't even play. Poor people, really! And what about drugs, drug addiction. Marijuana, crack, cocaine, not even cocaine, now, they scraping bricks. And snorting that. That annoys me! Annoys me and hurt me. Is a huge pain inside. Have to watch those poor people, support all that. Must be so hard. Yes. And what about public transport, that's a complicated subject. Most of those people work so far from home, almost no buses and don't have good frequencies. I agree with you. The public transport, that transport for poor people, is... the biggest problem of this city. You can imagine those poor people, have to wait sitting in a bus more than half life, if they can sit. When I drive my car by the highway, I have seen them, all together. Smelling... they don't smell like you, you smell different. That poor people smell very bad, they smell like wet, like rain, like resentment. Now you're talking about rain... I'm very sad. I know a girl... I know her since we're little. Her parents are very poor, but working people, honest people. They built a house with love and illusion, and the rain... the floods dragged everything. Don't tell me that. How painful... definitely we live, in a bubble, thank God. - You live here? - Yes. - Really? - No. I mean, I live over there. Close but not so close. I'm glad that we live close. I'm happy that we are so close. - Thanks to walk with me. - Thanks to you. - Goodbye. - Goodbye. Look that face! That girl drives him crazy! Look dude! If you want to sleep with that girl, the only thing that you have to do, is stop saying nonsense. What's that about poor people smells like misery and resentment. That you're annoyed about the people who live in a bubble. Here, the only one who lives in a bubble is he. You know from where that's bubble coming? From world's ass, that's where he lives. Do you want to sleep with her? Be yourself! Stop being a foolish! May be? Better go, because you afraid of being late to your neighborhood.

Because if you want, this weekend we can go to the club, and play a singles match. I trained in Bollettieri in Florida. - In the "Bolitieri"? - Do you know the club? Yes! No!

Probably is the same? - No. - "La Campiña"? No, no. - "Campogrande"? - No. Must be "Las Iguanas"? Give me more names... I don't know anymore. Is really easy to get there... at the right side, that side... at the right side, there are walls... and some bushes, pine trees greens... And in the entrance... the most important thing on my club is that, a huge sign, that say welcome. That public clubs, always have a huge sign for everyone get in there. Do you have any problem with my club, or what? No, no. So, we can make any plan together. No, I don't think so. My club is very exclusive, maybe they didn't give him permission to get in. Of course! For sure they don't let me get in. Cami is a little uncomfortable, maybe is better if we go just you and me. Another option, we can go to my place, an I'll make you an special cocktail. You don't know, all London is drinking that cocktail. Literally everybody, you gonna love it! Can we talk... We can chat! Tomorrow I pick you up. Bye! Bye! Can you call me? I'll make you a brownie too. Good. - Bye. - Bye. Dude... what are you gonna do? Don't worry, I stay here... in the neighborhood.

The electric light, the computer. Who pays for that? Us! Do you think that coffee and tea grow up in trees? No, sir, we pay for all that!

The human being, should stop worrying so much about changing others, and start changing himself. The human being inside... - Dude, give me money. - I'm working here. - Give me money. - Get out, I don't have money. - Get out! - Asshole! Stingy!

You told me that was you who crashed your car by dodging a dog. Yes! Wasn't a male dog, was a female dog. That's why I'm confused. What happens is that women confuse him. But, doesn't matter that's not the case, the point is, I send my driver to pick up my car, and the idiot crashed the car! What do you think? Is terrible. - But he's ok? - Yes, he's perfectly. Fortunately, because find trustworthy people it's difficult these days! Everyone wants to steal you betray you, envy you. That annoys me, you know? You haven't thought that your driver need his car to go to the doctor? Is not my fault! Is not my fault! He crashed my car! Besides, by general rule, if you damaged something, you have to pay it. You think if your maid broke something by accident, she have to pay it? - Yes, of course. - I don't want to talk to you. - Why not? - No! What a disappointment! You're an insensitive! - Give me a call? - No, I don't want to. Why not? Dad, this is my new school? This is not a school, this is a castle!

Please, please! - Ok, talk quickly, I have a rush. - Thank you. Following... what happened... about the car, the driver... about the way I treat the domestic service... I was thinking... and I noticed that I've been through bad times in life too. I have never lacked, some helping hand. For example, when I went backpacking to Europe... without money, because I wanted. Because I have money! But that poor vagabond, bring me a piece of hard bread. Or when I stole out of college, and I saw this poor kid running in the street without shoes, I gave him my shoes! Or when I crashed one of my dad's trucks, because he has five! And that poor farmer, with his two cows helped me to take out the truck of the ditch. All of that... made me think. And made me realize, that the material things, is just material. There's moments more valued and appreciated, that any richness in the world. That poor people... are above money. And this... the nature... planet earth, mother earth... are the most important things that we can have as humans beings. For that reason... for that reason I need... find my way again. Return to be one with the universe. Detox of all this garbage that I have inside, this demon inside of me. Unlock myself... letting go material things, back to be happy with... the little moments, the little things in life. I need to listen the silence. I need to smell the forest. I need to feel the mountains cold. I need to see the branches moving with the wind in the forest. And all of this, Laura, I want to share it with you. Just with you. What I want to say to you is... you wanna go to camping with me? I don't know. Come on, please, please! The truth is, you surprised me a lot. I don't expected see that sensibility. But what! Please! Please say yes! Do you want to go to camping with me? Ok, all right. - Do you want sweet cotton? - Yes. - A bigger one. - Wait here. Play! Hi, Luis, how are you? - Fine and you? - Fine. That guy who is buying a sugar cotton is your dad? No, he is my bodyguard, because my dad is a bank owner, he have many houses and cars, he travel around the world, in his private jet. But don't tell anyone, this is a secret between you and me. I have a secret too, behind me... nothing happened. But this is a secret between us. Lau... Lau, please forgive me. I tell you this with my heart in hand, forgive me! Everything was out of control... I had other plans with this, I planned it in other way. I planned it pretty, for you. For you, to have a good time. I'm an idiot! I'm so stupid! For example, about the food... that you hunting, our food. And the beans at night... I have a strong stomach, but you... with your princess stomach. Forgive me for the stomach ache. And the hammock... everyone loves sleep in a hammock, is a little uncomfortable but nice. Was not my idea directly, a friend told me about it, and he told me that was good. I didn't think in the rain and the insects... Lau, I know that... since I meet you, I've been behaving wrong with you. I've been rough, headstrong, one after another. But what can I do? This is who I am. I'm like this, what you see. There's nothing more. You surprised me a lot. Because... I loved what I saw this weekend... I loved the sensitivity that you have with nature... how you took care of me with my stomach ache. Even with everything that happened... was the best travel for me. I think that you're sincere. For all moments. Thank you. Do you want another kiss? MR. PRESIDENT Mr. President. - This is all information? - Yes. The comparative tables show that the oil well found are 2.5 times bigger than the Arabic countries. Did you speak with the Education Minister? Yes, I talked with her. She confirmed that the education will for free until postgraduate. Good. Did you met with Mr. Palomares? Yes, I talked with the Minister. And he said that the meeting between Health Minister and hospital owners was a success. We gonna have health insurance for free for everybody. Do you want that I answer for you? No, it's ok. What did you found? We found that the person who have the proofs against you, is your brother, Mr. President. We execute the plan? Yes, do it. Any problem, Mr. President? No, everything it's ok. - Must be I'm nervous. - Of course. Not every day a President can announce a life pension plan for all his citizens. Are the best news that a country can receive. Hey, pizza face! Chucho! Let him in. Chucho! Is good to see you. So, you remember me? Of course I remember you. You remember when we played at the club together? Remember we were partners? You remember that you left me on the street! You stole me and conned me! Chucho, why you don't continue with your psychiatric treatment? Any psychiatric treatment! You're clever and cunning! Mr. President, why you don't use that for people's service? I just wanted to say hello and to tell you... I can sleep peacefully. Can I walk by the street, without bodyguards. Please find this man, help him, give him everything he needs. A house, clothes, food. - Collaborate him. - Of course, Mr. President. Yes, help him... Buy him a house, clothes, food... whatever it takes to remain silent, and don't talk. Government largesse! You know where the money comes from to buy all that? From you, dude! From all your taxes! All your taxes... Wake up, dude! Stop being naive! Hi, my love. - What are you doing here? - Don't approach me. What is that? I accepted you everything. Everything! But this? You're despicable and disgusting. When I fall in love with you. - Let me explain to you. - No, I don't want to hear. All you want me to say send me an email. Get me out of these protocol events. I will attend strictly necessary. Mr. President, you need help? No, no, no. You swore me that you had finished everything with him! You swore me! Mr. President, everything is ready. In five minutes begins transmission. The comparative tables. And your speech. - Good luck, Mr. President. - Thank you. We are ready! Five... four... three... two... Tell me... with that face you going to leave these people, you're going to tell them that everything is fine, nothing happens. Or you'll invent one of those, smokescreens that you love, to divert attention, and they don't realize all you're living now? You're starting to promise them education, health, pension and food? And what about you, dude? Where you stay? My fellow citizens... I want to thank you for joining me, to the children foundation, I'm very happy for that. No, thank you for inviting me. You know... to me the situation of these people, It affects me very much. But have helped them, makes me feel good. It makes me feel like I collaborated, it makes me feel like happy. And not only I can collaborate, any person in this planet can do it, no matter what! Not even what, when, how or where! Doesn't matter the social "extracts", or if they are rich or poor, black or white. The important thing is help others. You know what is most important than that? How you do that. With that it is done. If you do it with this... with this beautiful heart... to give love to the word, that's all matters. That's beautiful. What are you doing! Kissing this boy in front of everyone! - You are so easy! - Mom! You remember I told you about Cami, my boyfriend? Camilito, of course, my daughter told me about you. Nice to meet you! How are you? My daughter told me that you're a very sensitive and emotional. That you're for everything. Can we get in? Of course, daughter, the bosses are very good people. Don't worry for that. Come in and drink some juice... Or may be some coffee... Some food... You know what is the problem here? We don't want to be ourselves. Because high class want to be European, French, English. Medium class want to be Americans. And low class want to be Mexicans. And intellectuals? You know what the intellectuals are? Argentinians! It's amazing, we only hear a message, if a foreigner tells us. That's a consideration. And to finish... with "The Oriyinals", I want to tell you, if you liked any story, or you felt something, or maybe you know someone like the story main character, recommend the movie. Word of mouth! And don't miss the second part because... this movie have second part. Right? Here's a title: To be continued. Ok, thanks for your attention. Hi, baby...
