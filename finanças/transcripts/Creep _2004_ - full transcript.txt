This is actually the fresh part. - Fresh? - Mm. - [George] It's like, how many different ways can shit stink? - [Arthur] It depends which area you're in. If you're in the sewers under Chinatown, there's a strange kind of seafood smell to it all. Whereas in Soho, you've got- - [George] Whoa, whoa, whoa. Stop right there. This ain't the fucking Discovery Channel. I only need to know the basics, man. - [Arthur] I'm just trying to educate you. - [George] Trust me, there's nothing I wanna know about shit. - Now, this is the kind of thing we're on the look for. You see, if this ain't cleared, the people upstairs are gonna be trading turds through their kitchen sinks. - [George] What is it? - It's shit. Uh, tampons, condoms, pretty much anything that'll fit down a toilet. And since you're the new boy- - Yeah, yeah, yeah, all right, all right, all right. I've got it. I swear to God, man, if it wasn't for my little girl I'd tell 'em to shove the parole up their arse. (waste gushes) (George yells) (Arthur laughs) Motherfucker! (Arthur snorts) What are you laughing at, man? I could catch the plague or something. - [Arthur] You just might. (creature screeches) - [George] What was that? What was that? - It's just echoes. - Echoes? From what, the zoo? (Arthur mimics creature screeching) - [George] Very funny. - [Arthur] So what did you get sent to prison for in the first place? - [George] What? - [Arthur] I said, "What did you get sent down for?" - A fucking travesty, that's what. I mean, I get sent down for dealing weed and that shit's legal now. If I got busted now for what I had on me then, they would have thrown it down the drain and not me. - [Arthur] Oh, you're a drug dealer. Chap I had last week was a pimp. (unsettling music) (footsteps sloshing) - [George] Now what? - I don't know. - What do you mean you don't know? - I don't know. Only, I haven't been down this tunnel for about a year, but this wasn't here. I'd have reported it. This is amazing. - [George] Am I missing something here? - [Arthur] I've got a new tunnel. - [George] So? - So, I've been walking these tunnels for 20 years and now I've got a new one. - [George] Well, if that's what does it for you, I'm scared. - Let's take a look. - [George] I ain't going down there! That shit's too deep. - What's the matter with you? - I can't swim. And I don't share your interest in pipes and tunnels. - All right. You stay there. - Yeah. You go for it, Sherlock. (chuckles) (unsettling music) (water trickles) (footsteps slosh) (suspenseful music) Arthur? Are you okay, Arthur? You'd better not be fucking with me. Shit. (unsettling music) (footsteps sloshing) Arthur? (something splashes) Oh, yeah. Okay, I get it, I get it.

I'm stuck down here. I got locked in. Someone's chasing me. - She's fucked. You'll not get any sense out of her. You'll be lucky to get any sense out of me. - Look, someone's been attacked, okay? - What are you going on about? - I got stuck on a train with this guy from work, right? And he was attacking me. - What, the guy from work? - Yeah, he went crazy and he, he was, he was trying to rape me and then the train doors opened and someone got him. - What do you mean they got him? - Pulled him off me! And I don't know, look- - Hey, hey, all right, all right. What's your name? - Kate. - Kate. All right, Kate. Well, look, I'm Jimmy, right? My wee beautiful wee lady here, this is Mandy. Have you got a cigarette? - Yeah, but- - No, no, nay buts, all right. Let's just have a cigarette, all right? Have a seat. - Okay. I'll have a seat. Okay. (lighter clicks) (Kate sighs) - First off, you can't get out of here at night. - What? - It's true. Once you're in, you're in. It's totally locked up. - But isn't there a guard? - There's one that works the control room, but we're not messing with him. - What do you mean? Why not? - 'Cause he don't mess with us. - Don't you listen? There's a maniac out there. - Nah, you don't know that. It sounds to me like some vigilante train driver's got a wee bit carried away. The way I see it, you should be thanking the man, not running away from him. - Oh no, no, no, no, no, no. You have no idea. You didn't see what he did to Guy. - The rapist? - [Mandy] You got a fag, Jim? - I'm telling you, something is not right down here. - There's a lot of things not right down here, sweetheart. - [Mandy] Can I have a fag, Jim? - You've got one in your fingers, babe. Now, if you don't mind I wanna get good and messy with my wee lady here. You're welcome to stay if you'll not mind my habit. - So, uh, you're just gonna do nothing? - Well, I wouldn't say that. Here, move. That's sleeping bag's not as damp as it looks. You can sit there. - All right, okay. I'm gonna pay you, all right? I'm gonna pay you if you get me to the control room, okay? - I've already told you, we're not messing with him. How much? - Uh, 50 pounds? - Well, uh, you know... I guess rules are made to be broken, eh? - [Kate] Thank you. - Babe. Mandy. Gonna go and help the wee lady here. - Who? - I'm gonna help our friend Kate, here. I'm gonna take her to see the guard. - Do you fancy her? - No, I fancy you. So, what are you, French? - [Kate] No, I'm German. - [Jimmy] German? I support Germany when they're playing against England at football. Come to think of it, I support anyone who's playing against England at football. - [Kate] How much further to the guard? - [Jimmy] Oh, it's quite a way yet. This place is a rabbit warren. Do you know, there's 400 miles of track down here? Plus loads more that ain't in use. - Really? - Aye, really. (unsettling music) (metal creaks) (suspenseful music) - Jim? - I think I might know what happened to your friend. - [Kate] What? - Well, a while back, some homeless people went missing. - What do you mean missing? - Disappearing. There was these rumors that something was creeping up on them at night and taking them. - Are you joking? - Course I'm fucking joking. Homeless people don't go missing. Homeless people are missing. - Jim? (suspenseful music) (something clatters) Jim? (dramatic music) Shit. Ray! (dog barks) Ray, come here! (rat squeaks) (dog snarls) Ray, come here! (suspenseful music builds) (rats squeak) (Mandy screams) (electricity buzzes) - I've been trying to get me and Mandy in a hostel 'cause the weather's getting cold. But the housing man, he's not been round for months. But he can't get in touch with me on the phone 'cause I've not got a phone. We were gonna stay at my mate Tommy's, but he got busted, he got done for dealing. - Okay listen, sweetie. I'm sorry. I really don't mean to be rude, but I don't care about your lifetime story right now, okay? We have to get to the security guard as soon as possible. - You're a cheeky fucking bitch. Do you know that? - [Guy] Kate. - Guy? Oh, my God, it's Guy. (Guy coughs) We're just gonna get help. We'll be right back, okay? - [Jimmy] What are you looking at me for? - I don't know. Can't we just get him off the rails? - He tried to rape you. Let him rot. - [Guy] Please, help me. - Fuck off. - Okay, listen. Listen. Will another 50 do it, huh? - You're lucky she's a soft touch, you know. If you tried to do that to my girl, I'd cut your fucking balls off. Fucking hell. (suspenseful music) All right, put your arms around my neck. (Jimmy groans) Fuck! - Jimmy, is that your dog? - Mandy? - Jimmy? We should stay together! Oh, Guy. (Guy whimpers) Who did this to you? - I'm sorry, Kate. I'm sorry. - Mandy! (suspenseful music) Mandy! Where is she? (Jimmy yells) Mandy! Mandy! Fuck! (Jimmy pants) - Guy, listen. I'm gonna go and get Jimmy, okay? And then I'm gonna go and get the security guard and then we'll get out of here, okay? Just stay here. You'll be fine. You'll be fine. Just stay awake and you'll be fine. - [Guy] Kate. - You'll be fine. You will... (electricity buzzing) (intercom buzzes) (classical music) (intercom buzzing) - Hello? - Hello? - [Security Supervisor] Who is that? - Hello. Are you the security guard? - [Security Supervisor] I'm the security supervisor. Now who are you? - Um well, I got locked in here and... Look, you have to help me. Somebody's really badly hurt down here and he's dying. - Are you part of the homeless crowd? - What? No, no. Well, yes, but no. - [Security Supervisor] Well, which is it? - [Kate] What difference does it make? Call an ambulance! - [Security Supervisor] Where is this person? I don't see him. - Where are you? Uh, is that you? Well, he's down here. - [Security Supervisor] Well, you'll have to pull him into view. - Are you kidding me? Just call an ambulance for God's sake. - I'm not calling anyone until I've established exactly what it is I'm dealing with here. For all I know there could be a gang of crackheads down there with you. - Do I look like a crackhead to you? Huh? - It's hard to tell. I'm watching you on a black-and-white monitor in a long shot. - [Kate] Listen, just call a fucking ambulance. The guy's bleeding to death. - And as soon as you confirm that, I will. - [Kate] Asshole. - I heard that. - Well, good. I'm going to get him, okay? Okay, Guy. I'm sorry. I'm gonna have to move you one more time. You'll be fine, okay? Guy? What are you... Guy? Guy? Okay, okay, okay, okay. Into shot so the fucker can see you. Look, asshole! Is this enough? He's dead! Now get me out of here! - Okay, uh, wait there. Get off! Go on, get out you filthy... (suspenseful music) Shoo! Get away. (dramatic music) (Security Supervisor gargles) (blood trickles) (classical music) - Oh, fuck. (dramatic music) (suspenseful music) (dramatic music) Jimmy. (suspenseful music) Jimmy. Where's Mandy? Did he get Mandy? The security guard's killed and Guy's dead. We have to leave right now. Jimmy. (pants) Oh no. No! Listen, can you hear me? Can you hear me? I'm making it very simple for you, okay? If, if I go through the next tunnel to the next station, is there gonna be another guard? Huh? Answer me, please. Fuck you, I'll do it by myself. - Are you finished? There's a torch over there. You'll need a pair of boots. (suspenseful music) (rat squeaks) (creature growls) (electricity buzzing) - Jimmy. How far is it to the next station? Huh? Jimmy, how far is it? - Uh, dunno. - What about the live track? - Uh, you'll be all right if you don't touch that one, that one. - Wai-wait. Whi-which one? - Um, don't touch any of them. - Ah, okay. Wait! Wait. (unsettling music) - I was gonna take her home. I was gonna take her back to Scotland and get her off the gear. I was gonna let my mam look after her. But I didn't. (metal creaks) - What was that? Jimmy, what was that? (suspenseful music) - A train. - Don't joke. - Don't joke on railway lines. - Come on then. Shit! (train brakes screeching) It's stopping. It's stopping! What if it's him? - [Jimmy] It'll just be a driver. - We don't know that, do we? - What are you going on about? They drive trains all night. They have to stop if they see someone on the line. Kate, are you not listening? The driver's gonna get us out of here. - No, I'm not listening to you 'cause you're not thinking straight. You're fucked out of your head. We have to assume it's him, do you understand? Maybe you're right, but we have to assume. Look, there's a passageway back here. Let's go. Do you think whosever driving the train killed Mandy? - I don't know, but I really don't wanna stay and find out. - I think I do. - [Kate] No, come on. (metal clatters) Seriously. Come on! - You don't understand. I wanna meet him. - Don't be stupid. Come with me. - Look, if it's the driver, I'll call for you, all right? If it's not, I won't. - No, I'm not leaving you here. - That's exactly what you're gonna do. Take Ray and go. Go! - Okay, okay. Fine, okay. (Kate panting) (water trickling) - [Jimmy] Here I am!

(Kate coughs) (Kate gasps) - What's your name? - George. - George, really? (laughs) - What's so funny? - I, I was supposed to meet a George tonight. This is not quite what I had in mind. (metal clangs) (dramatic music) (water gushes) (unsettling music) (girl screams) What was that? Huh? - [George] Ignore it. - What do you mean ignore it? Has the girl been here? Huh? - [George] I dunno. (suspenseful music) (George yells) - What? What? - [George] There's something in here. Something just touched my leg. There's something in here! - What is it? - It's just some blockage from the pipe. - How'd it get in your cage? - How should I know? - Maybe it floated underneath. - So? - Maybe the bars in between the cages don't touch the floor. - So? - So maybe we can swim underneath, pull ourselves out, and get out. You see, over there there's an open cage. Swim through, haul yourself out, then open mine. - I can't. - What? - I can't swim. - You don't need to swim. Just pull yourself under, okay? - I can't do that either. - Are you kidding me? - No, I can't hold my breath underwater. - Listen, you better learn now, 'cause if you don't, the only way you're gonna get out is if he pulls you out. - Sorry. This ain't no time for swimming lessons, all right, lady? (Kate gasps) (Kate gasps) - Just one more cage. Go on.

(unsettling music) - What? - Could you- - No. - [Kate] Can you please check if she's breathing? - Look at her. - Please. Please check. (unsettling music) - Are you okay? (somber unsettling music) She's dead. (Kate sobs) Come on, come on, come on. Ssh, ssh, ssh. - (sobs) It's my fault! - Listen, listen. - I paid Jimmy to come with me. - It's no one's fault. - All we've got to think about getting out of here. - He would have protected her. She would not be dead. - Listen, listen, I've got a daughter. And I really wanna see her again. All right? Ssh. Listen we're gonna get out, okay? Yeah? Come on. (Mandy rasps) - Please. (electricity buzzing) (fluorescent light clinking) - Hang on. Give me a torch. There's a tunnel behind this wall. (metal door clangs) The bricks are loose. Give me a hand. - Fuck the bricks.
