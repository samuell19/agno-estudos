♪♪ And we are going to comp your last two nights. I apologize for any inconvenience. Here at Wyndsor Hotels, your comfort is our priority. ‐ Thank you. ‐ Okay? Good morning. I see the Samuels are smiling, so that means you must have handled their complaint? Apparently, the maintenance workers putting up the lights made too much noise too early in the morning. Oh, my God. People will complain about everything. Yeah, but this time, I actually see their point. Not only is it too early in the day to be setting up, it is too early in general to be putting up all of this Christmas stuff. It's almost December. Yeah, but Thanksgiving just happened. If it were up to me, I wouldn't put any of this up until two weeks before actual Christmas. Mm, I forgot you're not a Christmas fan. You know, it's not that. It's just‐‐ Ugh, it's the most stressful time of year. There are a million things to do and not enough time to do it. It always feels like a chore. Well, then you're not doing Christmas right. Excuse me, I grew up in Garland Grove, a town so into Christmas, it was actually named Garland Grove. I know how to do Christmas. Garland Grove. Sounds like a magical place. Erin, can you sign off on this? There are Christmas stores open all year long. Well, sometimes you just need to buy a nutcracker in the middle of July. I get it. ‐ Thanks. ‐ You know... I used to love Christmas when I was younger. But with a job like this, it just means more work. Speaking of work, I have to check on the new linen delivery. Yes, that's right. Drinks later? Yes, please. Bianca, hello. Erin, darling, how goes things at my favorite hotel? Great, great. We're hosting a periodontist conference in the grand ballroom right now, we're on track with upgrading all of our linens, and Christmas decorations are going up. Wonderful. I can always rely on you. I'm calling because I'll be in tomorrow. Oh, I thought you were staying at the Wyndsor Miami for a few weeks. I'm leaving early. There's something I need to discuss with you in person. Oh, okay. Don't sound so worried. It's a good thing. Trust me. Great. I will make sure your suite is prepared. Thanks, dear. Talk soon. ♪♪ "It's a good thing. Trust me." Those were her exact words. That's so exciting. I mean, that's gotta be about Rome, right? That's what I'm thinking. I mean, the last time we talked, I asked her to consider me for the executive manager position at the Roman Wyndsor, and she did say she'd get back to me. You so deserve this. Thank you. I mean, Rome! I know. I would get to live in Rome and be in charge of my own hotel. You see? Christmas wishes do come true. You know what? This year, they just might. Ah! ‐ Cheers. ‐ Cheers. ‐ Good. ‐ Yep. Good morning, Miss Wyndsor. Erin, you look good. Tense, but when don't you? ‐ How was your flight? ‐ Dreadful. I had to fly commercial. Ugh! Let's go talk somewhere private, yes? When my grandfather opened up the first Wyndsor Hotel, I wonder if he knew a century later it would be the most popular luxury hotel chain on two continents. All thanks to me, of course. I'm sure he'd be impressed. Erin, you have done a wonderful job here, but I think it's time you're given moreresponsibility. You know, I couldn't agree more. That is why I want you to head up the opening of our newest hotel in... Yes! Garland Grove. Wait, what? We are opening a hotel in Garland Grove. And since it's your hometown, I thought you would be perfect to head up the launch team. Um, why Garland Grove? Wyndsor Hotels, it's a brand that exudes prestige. Garland Grove is just a small mountain town that people pass by on their way to go skiing. There's nothing wrong with that. It just doesn't seem like Wyndsor territory. Precisely. An untapped tourist destination. Yeah, I don't think I'm the best person for this job. I haven't been home in years, and it's very busy here. You are the perfect person for this because you are a problem solver, and we've been having some problems with it. Problems. The town doesn't seem too thrilled that we're there, so I need you to go there and calm everyone down and make them see that having a Wyndsor Hotel in their town is a good thing. And we need them to do it before the investors come to look at the property. When's that? Three weeks. I know it's a lot to ask, but you'll be home longer for Christmas. Oh, well, you know, my parents will be surprised. As soon as the investors are on board and the opening is set, I will find someone else to run it, and that leaves you open to take our executive manager position at our new hotel in Rome. What can I say? Garland Grove, I'm comin' home! ‐ So you have the schedules. ‐ Yes. And the vendor contact numbers? Yes, yes, I've got it all. Don't worry. You just focus on opening the best hotel that your town has ever seen, okay? And getting yourself to Rome. You know, it's funny how in less than 24 hours, my life got flipped on its head. And now I'm driving back to a place that actually has a store named "One Horse Open Sleigh." What do they sell? Sleighs. Oh, well, that makes sense. Look, this is gonna be great, okay? It's gonna be good for you. Just go with the flow. And for once, try to have a good time, okay? It's almost Christmas. That's not exactly my strong suit. Well, maybe not yet. All right. ‐ Bye, girl. ‐ Bye. ♪ Ooh ♪ ♪ Yeah ♪ ♪ Feel the love all around ♪ ♪ See the smiles across this town ♪ ♪ 'Cause the kids are counting down ♪ ♪ It's a Christmas state of mind ♪ You've reached Alice and Carl's.

I'm a slow coffee drinker, so it's pretty cool. ‐ Well, that's lucky. ‐ Yeah. Erin Roberts? Yes. I'm Connor, Penny's brother. Oh, my goodness, Connor, yeah. How are you? How's Penny? She's good, she's good. She's married, she has two kids. That's wonderful. What are you doing here? I am headed to the new Wyndsor Hotel. So am I. ‐ Wait, are you with that group? ‐ Oh, yes.

Um, not exactly. You work for Wyndsor. Yes. Yes, I do. Uh‐huh. ‐ Wow. ‐ Yeah. Okay. After you? ‐ Keep Garland local! ‐ Down with Wyndsor! Good news, everybody. I found the person in charge. Hi, it's nice to meet you all. Is there something I can help you all with? We've been out here day after day, trying to get some answers. Well, here I am. We don't want a Wyndsor Hotel in our town. So I've heard. Garland Grove has always been chain‐free, and we're proud of that. I'm here to address all of your concerns, I really am. In fact, part of my job is to start a dialogue with community members about how a Wyndsor property can benefit the town. Can you promise us nothing will change? Show her that flyer, Connor. Oh, I already did. I actually know her. Yes. I am from Garland Grove. I grew up with Connor, so I do understand your hesitance. Okay, what about my dad's grill? ‐ What about it? ‐ This hotel. It's gonna have a restaurant, right? ‐ Yes. ‐ How can you be sure it won't put my dad out of business? Because your dad's grill and this hotel's upscale restaurant are two very different things, covering all aspects of the dining spectrum. What about my B&B? Look, I'm gonna be honest with you all. This hotel is here, and it's going to open, so I really hope we can all get on the same page. How? I'm working on it. So if you'll excuse me, it's very nice to meet you all. Connor, it's good to see you again. Excuse me. ‐ So she's a friend of yours? ‐ Was. It's a different Erin from the one I used to know. ‐ You must be Erin. ‐ Oh! I'm Joe, the Wyndsor Hotel contractor. Nice to meet you. Yes, Bianca told me about you. ‐ Are we on schedule? ‐ Mostly. Just finishing updating a few of the east wing rooms and the dining space. Oh, and I'm restoring an old carousel I found around back. Quite the hidden gem. Oh, okay. Well, I would love to meet the rest of the staff. Marnie! Marnie, this is Erin, acting manager. ‐ Oh! ‐ Hello. Hello! Hi. Erin Roberts. It's nice to meet you. Good to meet you. I'm Marnie Hill. I used to supervise the front desk at Wyndsor Chicago. And our friend Bianca offered me a raise if I'd transfer out here with you, so here I am. Here we are. Well, I would love to meet the rest of the staff. I think it's just you and me. I'm sorry, what? I have to get this place ready for investors in three weeks. It's just us? Well, Bianca did hire a chef, world‐renown culinary artist Francois Klumier. Oh, okay, wonderful. Where is he? Well, he had a run‐in with the people outside. You know, the ones handing out the flyers. And he decided that he could not possibly work in a place where he was not appreciated, and so he's gone. Okay, um... All right, it's... it's okay. I will just hire some local staff, which shouldn't be a problem because they all don't like us. Well, every hotel has... Minor hiccups. Yes. Just give the people time to warm up to us. Trust and believe everything's gonna work out. It better. My future depends on it. ♪♪ ‐ ♪ Christmas is coming ♪ I can't believe you're here! Hey, Mom. It's pretty crazy, huh? Oh, it's so great to see you right here on our front porch versus, you know, having to visit you in Chaos Central. Most people just call it New York City. Oh, whatever. I'm just so glad you got assigned here! Come on in, baby. Daddy is waiting for you. ‐ Oh. ‐ God, you look so beautiful. Erin! Oh, welcome home! Oh, it's good to see you, Dad. Oh, it's so good to have you back. I fixed up your room. New mattress. Oh, thank you. Oh, and I cooked chicken parm in our new Ninja Air Fry Oven. You know how your daddy loves a good kitchen appliance. I do. It smells great. Oh, and did I mention? Chocolate chip cookies for dessert. Mm‐hmm. This all looks amazing, but I actually just wanted to drop off my bags. I gotta get back to the hotel and do some work. No, no, no, no. That can wait till tomorrow. It can't. I have to find a way for this town to embrace us. What? Baby, they do have a point. Honey, I mean, really, is having one of your company's hotels here really the best thing for Garland Grove? You know, I really think it would help bring jobs and more tourism to the town. Yeah, but that's just the best‐case scenario. Well, I need it to work because if it does, I get the job I actually want. Wyndsor in Rome. ‐ Rome. ‐ Rome. Well, that's really far. I know. Oh, my gosh, wouldn't it be amazing though? Oh, yes. Erin, you might not be so welcome when people find out who you really work for. Trust me, I felt it this morning. Penny's brother Connor was outside of the hotel, handing out anti‐Wyndsor flyers. Mm‐hmm, makes sense. He is one of the leaders of the movement. Well, hopefully, I can change his mind. Wait a minute. You used to have a huge crush on him, didn't you? ‐ Huh? Dad, I was like 13. And as I remember, he liked her too. Yep! ‐ No, he didn't. ‐ Oh, girl! Uh‐uh. I was just Penny's friend, just another annoying little sister. ‐ Well, you're both adults now. ‐ Leading very different lives. Like two ships passing in the wind. It's "night," Dad. ‐ Oh. You know what? It doesn't matter because what's important is that you are here, and we are all gonna sit down and have dinner together, just like old times. Yeah! I'm gonna get your bags. No, it's okay. I'll go get 'em. She still won't let people help her. That's your daughter. But you know what? Doesn't matter. She's here, and that makes Mama happy. Come here, Mama. ‐ Cookies! ‐ The chicken. Oh! So in addition to hiring a new chef, I have to hire a kitchen staff, a concierge, the housekeeping manager, and I need to make sure all the furniture is delivered on time, and just make sure everything is up to the Wyndsor standard of perfection. Good grief. That seems like a lot to put on you. Well, Bianca trusts me, and she knows I can do it. Well, if you ever need any help, just let me know. Handyman here. Thanks, Dad, but we have a contractor in charge of all that. What's going on with the hardware store? I drove by it on my way in and there weren't that many cars in the parking lot. Well, things have been a little slow lately. Little bit. Oh, but it's Christmastime. Doesn't the whole town get its lights from you? They used to. Now everybody orders them online. Leave it to this town to embrace Internet shopping, but get heated over a luxury hotel chain. Well, you know how we are. Well, you know, I'm gonna need a few lights for the hotel, it being December and all. You need it, we got it. Excuse me, a few lights? Girl, this is Christmas in Garland Grove. You gonna have to do a little more than that. As acting manager, I am going for a subtle decor. One less thing for me to worry about. Child, sometimes I wonder if you were really born and raised here. Mm! This is good, baby. You did good. ♪♪ So this is where we should hang the chandelier that's coming in from New York. And the couches will be here in a day or two, so, yeah, all of these floors have to be polished by then. Roger that. Marnie, how's it going with the list of applicants? Well, no one's submitted a resume as of yet, so I hung some flyers up downtown. ‐ Smart. ‐ Yeah. And then they got torn down. Keep at it. I'm sure someone in this town wants to work here. Yeah. I wish they would just wait, give this place a chance. Well, I'm sure they will. We just have to give them some time. That's the one thing I don't have a lot of. Do you see that guy out in front? Oh, yeah, the one that's easy on the eye? I see him. Well, I was best friends with his younger sister. Penny and I were inseparable growing up, so by default, I saw a lot of him. Maybe I can ask her to sway his opinion. Sooner the better. Looks like someone from the press is interviewing them. Erin, hey! Hi, Mr. Stevens! I heard you were in town. How is it that you look exactly the same? Oh, you're being too kind. But you can see the hair missing, right? I was hoping to see Penny. I wanted to say hi. You know, it's been so long. She would love that. She usually stops by in the afternoon, after she drops the kids off at choir. Shouldn't be too long. ‐ Do you mind if I wait? ‐ Of course not. Can I get you anything? Peppermint hot chocolate. Oh, that sounds absolutely perfect. Coming right up. Taking a break from talking to reporters? For the time being. You still work here? Why say it like that? Like that's a bad thing. I didn't mean any‐‐ I just thought‐‐ Thought what, that I'd be doing something else by now? Connor here is the best chef I know. And that's saying a lot, considering I taught him all that he knows. Thanks, Dad, but I think what Erin is trying to say is that compared to her super‐important job of ruining our town, that what I'm doing is not that impressive. Well, I wasn't saying that at all. You see? That's not at all what she was saying. I'm just surprised that you still work here. When we were younger, you said you wanted to travel and see the world. Well, actually‐‐ No, Dad. It's okay. Erin's already made up her mind about me. Haven't you made your mind up about me? That I work for some evil corporation trying to destroy this town? I never said evil. You know what? I've got to go. ‐ I have lots of work to do. ‐ Okay. Mr. Stevens, it was so nice seeing you. Tell Penny I'll call on her again. Erin? Oh, Penny! Oh, wow! It's been so long! I can't believe you're back here. Well, you know why I'm really in town, right? Yes, Connor filled me in. Yeah, I'm the one who's single‐handedly destroying this place. He didn't put it in such nice terms. Well, I think I just made it worse. Oh? I said I was surprised that he still works at your dad's grill. Well, it's not really still. More like again. What do you mean? Yeah, he's been traveling all over the place for like 10 years. ‐ Really? ‐ Yeah. Studying the culinary arts. He is an amazing chef. He's just working for my dad now to save up enough money so that he can open up his own high‐end restaurant here in town. Wow. Wow, I feel like an idiot. That's why he's against the hotel. It would mean a competing restaurant. Yeah, among other things. I mean, he kinda likes that everything here's one of a kind, and a Wyndsor Hotel wouldn't be. Wow, so he's a chef. Yeah. You know what? I have to get back to work. I have so much to do, and there's so little time. Can I just say how impressed I am at your amazing career and you following your dreams of living in the city? Thank you. I just miss pursuing my painting. Oh, I missed you. I missed you too. Mm. Well, I checked, and we are fully stocked. Honey, you can have any kinda Christmas light you want. Thanks, Mom. I'm sorry this place isn't that busy. Yeah, me too. But you never know. Like you said. Maybe your new hotel will turn this thing around. What's this? That's our Christmas collage. Just memories of different Christmases past. Look at what I'm wearing. You picked it. Look at Penny and Connor. Oh, you know, that was the Christmas the three of you thought if you didn't ask for any presents... We'd get bonus points with Santa, and he'd give us one big, huge present the next year. Oh, honey, you used to love Christmas. I know. So what happened? You know, I just‐‐ I was eager to move to the city and start my career and... I don't know, our town and Christmas itself just got put to the back burner. Well, I think it's fun that an entire town loves something so much that they wanna celebrate together for more than one day. Let's face it. We are the year‐long Christmas oasis for people who can't get enough of that holiday. Maybe you should put us back on the front burner. What? You're right. I am? This town does love anything having to do with Christmas. Maybe that's the key. Yeah, that chair goes right over there. No problem. Oh, this table, put it in the center of the rug, please. Thank you. Deliveries are right on schedule with a bed in every room, which is a must. ‐ Indeed. ‐ Mm‐hmm. Joe and his crew are installing the appliances in the kitchen right now, so all in all, I'd say we're ahead of schedule. Yes! Great. Oh, well, I hope that's Bianca calling to congratulate us. Oh, well, all right. Bianca, hey! Erin, what is going on over there? What do you mean? We're ahead of schedule, and the place is almost completely furnished. Some reporter caught wind of the town's objections to us. ‐ Oh, no. ‐ I'm sending you the links now. There's been a drop in reservations. Okay, let me look. Um... You know, it's a work in progress with the community. Wyndsor Hotels cannot afford this type of bad publicity. ‐ I know. ‐ I put you in charge because I thought you knew how to handle the people from your town. Well, I do have this one idea. I don't care how you do it. Just make that town excited that we're there. ‐ Of course. ‐ If the investors catch wind of this, that's a huge hit against us. Not to mention I'll need you back at your New York post because Rome will not happen then. Oh, no, I'm Rome or bust, so I promise you I will fix this. Do that. Everything okay? Uh, yeah, there's a change in plans. Okay. This town is about one thing, and that's Christmas. It's time I jump back on the tidings train. Hmm. Okay, everything is all set for tomorrow morning. Now, are you sure you wanna go through with this? It is my job to create the perfect hotel for Garland Grove, and that's what I'm gonna do. All right, well, Joe says he can have everything set up so that you can have your own version of a press conference. Thank you so much, Marnie. You're welcome. Just so you know, nothing that Wyndsor Court announces today is gonna change our minds. We'll see. ‐ Hi! ‐ Hi, babe. Ah! Good morning, Garland Grove. Good morning! Thank you all so much for being here. We at Wyndsor Hotels aim to please. Then leave. ‐ I have a better idea. ‐ Mm‐hmm. I will be rebranding the building you see behind me into Garland Grove's first‐ever... Christmas hotel. ‐ Whoo! ‐ Oh, my gosh! ‐ That's so sweet! That's my baby. Christmas Hotel will host Christmas activities all year long. It will be decorated for Christmas all year long, and it will be an oasis for all those who love Christmas and want to be immersed in the holiday all year long. We'll be hiring lots of you to help spread that Christmas joy. Garland Grove is the home of Christmas, and this hotel will be the heart of Christmas. Community of Garland Grove, I present to you your Christmas Hotel! Well, I got all the basics like holly, tinsel, and lights, but it doesn't feel like enough for a Christmas hotel. Well, why don't you try theme rooms? You know, like a Rudolph Room or a Santa Suite. Oh. How am I going to do all this in time? Oh, honey, come on, you're a hard worker, and we have nothing but faith in you. Yeah, but I'm rusty when it comes to all things Christmas. Well, here's a thought: Ask for help. Marnie is out there looking for staff. How 'bout Connor? Connor? Wait a minute. That's a good idea. He is the chairman of the town Christmas committee. And he's responsible for all the decorations on Main Street. We didn't exactly start off on the best foot. Well, but now that you've changed it to a Christmas hotel, I bet he'd be a lot more willing. All right, I guess I could try. Oh, while you're at it, why don't you bring him one of these? He's always in here buying them. He loves them. Okay. Connor? Uh, feel free to look around. Um, uh... Well, your dad said that you would be back here, so I just, um... Candy bar? Uh... Oh, thanks. I actually like these. What's all this? It's just some ideas I have for when I have enough money to open my own restaurant here in Garland Grove. My dad has all the casual fare covered, but I think the place needs something that's a little bit, you know, more upscale. Oh. Something you might find in, say, a nice hotel? That's why you're against it because the hotel will compete with your dream place. It's one of many reasons. Hmm. Christmas Cafe. Well, you know, as I'm sure you've discovered, Christmasifying a business around here is the best way to go. Well, it stopped you guys from passing out flyers. True, for the time being, until we see how this Christmas Hotel works out. Right. Actually, that's why I wanted to talk to you. I was hoping I could get your help. See, I'm a bit in over my head with turning something into a Christmas anything, and since you're Joe Christmas... I thought maybe you could share some ideas. You know, some tips. So let me make sure I have this right. You, who works for a hotel that came into this town uninvited, are asking me, the leader of the said anti‐hotel movement, for help? Yeah, because I actually wanna open a good hotel. Look at it as another way for you to spread some Christmas cheer. You know, I got a lot going on. When do you plan on opening up Christmas Cafe? Year or two, three tops. What if you could open it this month? How? I can't promise you anything, but the Christmas Hotel needs a chef for its restaurant. The kitchen is built, the dining room is built, the chef Wyndsor hired quit because of you and your friends. So what if we hired you and made the Christmas Cafe a part of the Christmas Hotel? Are you serious? Yeah. I mean, I'd have to run it up the chain of command, and I'm sure there'd be a tasting audition of some sort, but I don't see why it couldn't happen. You'd do that for me? Yeah. I mean, in return, you could help me make the Christmas Hotel an actual Christmas hotel. Uh... ‐ Yeah. ‐ Yeah? Yeah, you got a deal. Great. So the main tree should be right there, and each room should have its own tree, including the guest rooms. They should all be decorated a little bit differently. Ah. My dad suggested themes. Exactly. I love it. And more built‐in shelves right here for nutcrackers. Yes. I like it. And what you want is a variety of different Christmas lights all along here. And since it's a year‐long Christmas hotel, all the decorations should be permanent. Most of it should actually be built into the wall, so it doesn't seem seasonal. Yes. You got that, Joe? Copy that. What he said. And every fireplace needs stockings. And they need to be personalized stockings for the entire staff, so that people can get to know them better. Hmm. Yeah, that's great. All right, well, I'll just add learning to sew to my list of things to do. It's the best place to get personalized decorations that you can't find anywhere else. It's really special. ‐ Okay. ‐ So what about all the Christmas activities? Ah, I have an idea for that. A gingerbread baking class. It's something I've always wanted to teach. I mean, anybody can make a gingerbread house, but the dough, that's what's key. Oh, and one more thing. This is something the community's been asking about, and we haven't even organized it yet, but they're thinking about a Santa costume contest. Oh, Joe, you oughta enter that. But I don't look like Santa. Mm‐mm. You're in much better shape than Santa. I better get going on all these changes. Connor, bring it in. Oh, good to have you on our team. It's good to be here. Yes, well, gotta go. Okay. ‐ They're cute. ‐ Yeah. And see? You were trying to put them out of a job. Oh, give me a break. But honestly, those were some really great ideas. It's like your brain thinks in Christmas terms. Well, you could do it too. I do seem to remember that you used to like Christmas when we were young. You know, I was looking at the old pictures my mom has up, and I forgot how exciting Christmas used to be. How as a kid, it just feels bigger than anything else in the whole world. Well, it can be fun and exciting for adults too. I think as I got older, I saw the holiday as a task. Ah. I lost sight of the joy. Well, my hope for you is that you can find it again. The joy. 'Cause it's really great. That's what I keep hearing. Well, first things first. Yeah, what's that? Trees. Yeah, trees. Yeah. Yeah, the most important part of opening your Christmas hotel is making sure you always have excellent trees. Which could be a problem because we need trees all year long. That's why we're here. If anyone can help us find trees for all year long, it's Mr. Baker. Mr. Baker? Wait, our first grade teacher that made us do an entire production of A Christmas Carol at seven years old? Yeah, yeah. ‐ That Mr. Baker? ‐ Yeah. The one and only. Yeah, there he is. Yo, Mr. Baker! Connor! Here for more trees? I thought you already had one for your place and the grill. Well, actually, I'm here for the Christmas Hotel. You remember Erin Roberts? Yes, of course. ‐ Erin, wow! ‐ Oh, hi. Oh, look at you. Oh, it's been so long. You know, you were the best reader in my class. Thank you. It's because you're a great teacher. Oh, flattery will get you far at this Christmas tree farm. Well, then I love your sweater. Oh, I made it myself. Really? It's a passion project of mine. Oh, that's perfect. I don't know if you've heard, but I'm opening up a Christmas hotel. Oh, no, of course, yes! I think it's a wonderful idea. Oh, well, we have investors coming and then a grand opening. We are gonna need a lot of trees. Right, and we were hoping to have a tree in every single room. Well, the thing is, it's a year‐round Christmas hotel. Could you be our supplier all year long? Christmas trees year round, you say? Mm‐hmm, yeah. I think there's a way we could do it, provided you don't mind that your trees are a little bigger than normal. All right. Hmm, okay. So I will make all of the calculations. I'll let you know what it will take, but I think it's a marvelous idea. ‐ Great. ‐ That's great. In the meantime, we'll take a dozen or so now. Oh, fantastic! Look at that! The hotel's already helping local business. That, it is. Yeah, I see you giving me that I‐told‐you‐so look. I see it. I'll get your trees prepped. Thanks, Mr. Baker! You know, that's something else the hotel can do. What? Feature products from local businesses. ‐ I like that. ‐ Mm‐hmm. Oh, look. The line is not that long for the reindeer ring toss. How old are you again? I take my niece and nephew there all the time. It's fun. That's because they're small children. You don't have to be a child to enjoy it. Look, I have a lot of work to do, so let's get the trees and go. Weren't you the one that said you wanted to rediscover the joys of Christmas? No, I didn't say those words exactly. Yeah, you did. Come on, let's go. Okay, fine. ♪♪ You look ridiculous. That's the point. Just stand still and stop laughing, so I can put this thing on, all right? ‐ Chin up, chin up, chin up. ‐ Okay, okay. ‐ All right, there we go. ‐ You got it? Yes. Now, these are for you. Okay. These are mine. Now take a few steps back. All right, throw it at me, come on. ‐ Oh. ‐ Ooh. I'm sorry! That's why they're inflatable, okay? Now watch me. I'm gonna show you how it's done, all right? Okay. Oh! Ho ho! The crowd goes wild! Can you hit a moving target? That's not the rules. You gotta stay still. What, what? Try to catch me! Stay still so I can put it on, all right? ‐ Stay still? ‐ Yes! Stay still! Well, that would be easy. No! It's a good thing we didn't keep score. It's good for you 'cause otherwise you'd know that I won. Uh, excuse me, I pretty much dominated. How'd you get so good at this? What, the reindeer antler toss? No, at Christmas. I guess because our mother loved it so much. I was sorry to hear about her passing. Thanks. It's been rough, but I figured that one of the best ways to remember her is to do something that she loved, and she loved Christmas. It's one of the reasons I came back. Yeah, Penny said you were traveling for like 10 years. Yeah, but you know, one thing I realized after being in dozens of places is that my mom and dad had it right. Garland Grove, home of Christmas, is just plain home. Hmm. Were you ever in New York? Few times. I would've called, but you're horrible at keeping in touch, so I didn't‐‐ I know. I'm gonna be better at that. Good, 'cause I don't wanna wait another 10 years to hang out with you again. Yeah. Garland Grove is a pretty special place. It's the people that make it special. Okay, okay, okay, I got one. Remember the Christmas where Connor had his mind set on trapping Rudolph? Wait, I don't remember that. Look, "trap" has a very negative connotation. I just wanted to meet Rudolph and have him be my personal pet reindeer. Anyway, parents went to sleep, he woke me up and went upstairs to the attic, opened the window, let in all the cold air and dangled carrots, using his fishing pole. Oh, because obviously Rudolph couldn't resist your carrots. ‐ Obviously. What about you, Erin? You have any Christmas memories? When I got my kitten, Bundles. ‐ Oh! ‐ You guys were there, right? ‐ Mm‐hmm. ‐ Yes. You called with sheer excitement when you opened that box. We played with Bundles all day. Yes, Bundles was the best. Wait, do you remember that little tuxedo ‐ we made him in home ec? ‐ Yes! With the little fake boots? They were so cute! Poor cat. Oh, stop, it was cute. I liked it. Christmas memories are so special, and for some reason, I just locked all of mine up in a cabinet for no reason. Hmm. Hey, that's a good idea. What's that? For the hotel. We invite the town, and they put all their Christmas memories on decorations for the new trees. That's such a good idea. You are getting the hang of this. Don't be so surprised. Oh. Oh! It's snowing. ‐ It's a bit windy. ‐ Look at that. That's beautiful. Yep, it's that time of year. ♪♪ And here's some more. Thanks, Dad. I can't believe how many people showed up. Oh, I can. You know, decorating trees and sharing memories is a highlight of Christmas. This was great planning. Well, it wouldn't be the same without these wooden ornaments you made. I had some lumber, and I'm always happy to help. I'm happy to have your help. Oh, that's my baby. You know, people keep asking me where I got these. I told them they can only be purchased at the Garland Store. Well, look at you. Now, that's cross promotion. Hey, I better make some more. Yeah. Oh, my kids love the nutcrackers on the shelves. Oh, yeah, that's all Connor's doing. He's really good at this Christmas stuff. That, he is. Spending a lot of time together, hmm? Huh? You and my brother. Well, yeah, he's been a great help. Oh, come on, I‐‐ It's not like that. God, he's your older brother. I literally didn't say anything. ‐ I know your faces. ‐ Oh? Can I show you something? Sure. You wanted to show me a wall? A blank wall. Okay. I was hoping you'd do a mural. Something Garland Grove‐esque. Really? I mean, we'd pay you for it. I have never been commissioned to do anything before. So what do you say? I would love to! Okay, the only hard part is we have to have it done by the time the investors come. I can do that. Brad can take care of the kids. Thank you, Erin. You are such a talented artist, and people need to see it, so it's my pleasure. What's going on here? Erin has just commissioned me to paint a Garland Grove mural on this wall. Love it. Come on, now!

I'm sorry I misjudged you. I guess I did the same thing to you when I saw you get out of that car with that Wyndsor Hotel bag. Well, we both jumped to conclusions. Mm‐hmm. You know, I, uh... I had a crush on you back in the day. Really? Um, why didn't you ever say anything? I don't know. I was just... I was your best friend's dorky older brother, and I just figured you'd always see me that way. I don't know. I had a crush on you too. Really? And why didn't you say anything? For the same reasons. I was your little sister's friend. You know, I was scared. I guess everything turned out the way it was supposed to. Well, with cooking skills like this, I'm surprised you're still single. Oh, and with hotel management skills like that, I mean, same goes for you. Yeah, well, when you work as hard as I do, it's hard to find time to date. Is it worth it? Working so hard for Wyndsor. It will be when I get to Rome. Rome? Yeah. Depending on how all this goes, I'll have my dream job. Which is? Wyndsor in Rome. Ah! Well, I guess it's time for dessert. Oh, no, no, no, there's no room left. It's a cookie dough trifle. Okay, I'll see what I can do. All right. I'll be right back. ♪♪ There you are. Okay. Go ahead. There you go. ‐ Welcome to the Wyndsor. ‐ Thank you. Hey, there. How about you take a little break? Bianca and the investors are gonna be here in a few days, and I still feel like I have so much more to do. And you'll do it, but there is always time for you to have a cup of tea with your mama. You're right. You know, Daddy is so happy you asked him to make those wooden ornaments for the Christmas memories. I was thinking about doing more of that. ‐ Really? ‐ Mm‐hmm. Featuring things that hotel guests can buy around town. Mm‐hmm. Dad should make more of those to sell. People love them. Connor says we should probably add more trees because there's so many more memories. Mm‐hmm. Uh, what's that smile for? Oh, nothing. Your face just lights up when you mention Connor. He's been a really big help. Is that all? Childhood crushes, they fade, Mom. Yeah, well, what about adult crushes? What happens to them? Life usually gets in the way. Only if you let it, baby girl. It is with great pleasure that I officially unveil the newest addition to our Christmas hotel, a mural painted by a very talented artist and my close personal friend, Penny Stevens. ‐ Whoo! Oh, Penny! Penny, it's wonderful. You like it? I love it. You perfectly captured the town. Hey, look, there's our Garland Grill. Thank you so much. Thank you. My first commissioned painting. Ooh, it feels so good to say. And there's more to come. I'm sure guests are gonna want more of this, so maybe we can feature some of your other artwork in our gift shop. Really? Yeah, so get to work! So looks like everything came together. Not quite. We still have to make sure the investors are satisfied, so they continue to invest in Wyndsor Hotels. Well, I have some ideas I'd like to run by you before the investors arrive. ‐ Oh? ‐ Mm‐hmm. I don't think any other hotel has ever had a welcome like this. Go big or go home. I can't thank you enough. Not just for all of this, but for the last few weeks. I couldn't have done this without you. ‐ It was worth it. ‐ Yeah? Yeah. You helped me fulfill my dream of opening my own Christmas Cafe. ‐ Helping each other out. ‐ Mm‐hmm. That's what friends are for. Friends, yeah. ‐ Oh, look, there they are. ‐ All right. ♪ Fa la la la la La la la la ♪ Okay, good luck. Thank you. Hello. Nice to meet you. Erin Roberts. ‐ Erin Roberts. ‐ Pleasure, pleasure. ‐ Nice to meet you. ‐ Erin Roberts. Wow, Erin. This is quite a welcome. You certainly got the community on board. We cannot wait to see what else you have in store for us. I cannot wait to show you. Please, come on in. What we wanted to do with the Christmas Hotel is create a place where people could experience the magic of Christmas every day of the year. As you may know, this town has a unique history with Christmas. This town was founded by Thomas Garland, a man so in love with Christmas that he wanted to create a place that embodied the spirit of the holiday all year round. I'm sure as you were driving in, you saw that most of the businesses here in Garland Grove are Christmas oriented, yet there's never been a central hub with this many Christmas activities until now. Tell me about these ornaments. Oh, well, these are favorite Christmas memories from residents of Garland Grove. And when guests stay here, they can add their memories to the tree. What a fun idea. And this mural, tell us about that. Yes, this mural is by a local artist named Penny Stevens. Many of her prints can be found in our gift shop. In fact, a lot of the decorations and merchandise here in the lobby can be purchased right here in Garland Grove. Now, if you will follow me, I would love to show you our Christmas Cafe. Let me introduce you to our executive chef, Connor Stevens. Welcome to the Christmas Cafe. Please sample one of our desserts, the butterscotch eggnog cookie. ‐ Ooh. ‐ They smell delicious. Yeah. This place looks great. The ambiance here immediately fills me with joy. Oh, I'm glad, and you haven't even seen the rooms. Each one has its own Christmas theme. That's fun. Aside from the year‐round decorations and the ornaments, what is it that makes Christmas Hotel a Christmas hotel? Hmm, well, we have surprises and activities planned for you that will answer that question. That sounds wonderful. In fact, after you've settled into your rooms, we'll invite you back down for a gingerbread‐making class in our kitchen. Oh, marvelous. You're welcome. There you are. You're welcome. They're all so polite. And there you go. ‐ Thank you. ‐ You're welcome. No, no, no. I'm just going to watch. Come on, Erin, join in on the fun. If I, who have never cooked a day in my life, am doing this, so should you. Mm‐hmm. Thanks. Oh, thank you. Now, the key to making the perfect gingerbread dough is? Sugar. ‐ Bread? ‐ Flour. The correct ratio between cinnamon and ginger cloves. Now if you have the wrong recipe or if you make a few missteps, your dough could end up hard or bland. But here at the Christmas Hotel cooking class, we ain't gonna let that happen. ‐ Yeah. ‐ Nice. ♪♪ What? I'm... I followed the directions. You have flour on your face. Oh. I'm sorry. Is my dough supposed to be this sticky? Yes, it's supposed to be super sticky. That's perfect. You're doing great. Oh, thank you. Look at this place. I wonder if Connor's still in the kitchen. I would assume so. I kinda wanna wish him luck. I see the way you look at him. Connor? You would tell me if there's something going on. I don't know. We've been spending so much time together and getting to know each other again after all these years. I... Maybe. I totally could possibly be starting to care for him. Oh, I knew it! Did you tell him? ‐ No, I can't. ‐ Why not? Because if tonight goes well, I'm going to go to Rome very soon. I don't wanna start something I can't finish. Maybe you're right. I just get lost in the fantasy of it all, my brother and my best friend. I'm still your best friend? Of course you are. It doesn't matter, the time between visits. You are my best friend for life. Aww. I better start dinner soon. Just go ahead and take a seat. ‐ Okay. ‐ Okay. Hi. Hi. Oh, thanks. Good evening, everyone. As you all know, this is Christmas Cafe's very first service, and we are so happy to have you all with us. Bon appetit! ‐ There you are. ‐ Hey. What are you doing out here? It's freezing. I just needed some fresh air. Just pacing the kitchen, wondering if they're enjoying my food. It's nerve‐wracking. What are you talking about? Everybody's loving dinner. Yeah? Yeah. You're a hit. You look absolutely beautiful tonight. Thank you. You look beautiful every night. And day. And whatever happens next, what you're doing here's really special. What we're doing here is really special. Oh, oh, I'm so sorry. I... I really didn't mean to interrupt, but, uh, they're ready for the next course. So, uh, you two just... Carry on. Well, I, uh... guess I'd better serve dessert. Yeah, you don't wanna keep them waiting.

You know, we just got caught up in the moment and the festivities, and it's just better if we leave it at that. Yeah. Maybe you're right, you know? I guess there's a reason we never got together ‐ when we were younger. ‐ Yeah. It's just not in the cards. Looks like the judges made their pick. Oh! I'd better get to it. Yeah. ‐ What do you have? ‐ Here you are. Great. Yes. Oh! Our runner‐up... the dynamic duo, Mr. And Mrs. Claus! Oh! Yes! ‐ Here's your ribbon. ‐ Thank you. Hold it right there. ‐ Thanks. ‐ Thank you.

Is this good news? They said they have nothing but good feelings about Christmas Hotel and Wyndsor Hotels in general. They are going to invest in the Rome hotel and three others. Oh, that's great! This is all you. You did this. I had some help. I knew picking you for this project would work out. And you know what? I'm really happy you did. So I wanna officially offer you the executive manager position of our new Wyndsor Hotel in Rome. ‐ Really? ‐ Yes. I mean, look at what you did with this place. I can't wait to see what you'll do in Rome. Well, what about the Christmas Hotel? Who's gonna run it? You don't need to worry about that. You are going to Rome. I'm going to Rome. ‐ Oh. Wonderful news. Chef Bram is available. He is this incredible chef from the Netherlands. Oh, for the Rome hotel? No, Christmas Hotel. But the Christmas Hotel already has a chef‐‐ Connor. You said you loved his food. Don't get me wrong. His food was good, and he got our investors on board. But it's easier to market our restaurant here if we have a world‐renown chef. He's my friend. You know better than anyone this isn't personal. It's just business. ‐ Oh, I have to take this. But you did it. You got Rome. Whoa, there, son. That's enough dressing in that salad. I'm sorry. There something on your mind? Christmas Hotel. And the girl running it. ‐ I'm that transparent, am I? ‐ I'd say so. She's leaving soon. So give her a reason to stay. What do you mean? Tell her how you feel about her. She's not gonna stay for me. Then there's nothing to lose. She's leaving. At least this way you won't have to wonder what would have happened if you said something. I wish every day I could still tell your mother how much I love her. Take advantage of the moments that you have. ‐ Hey. ‐ Hi. Could you do a skinny soy caramel macchiato to go? I think I can make that happen. Thank you. And I hope there's no hard feelings about the Christmas Cafe. You know how it is. Our board wanted a known chef. What? Oh. I figured Erin would've told you by now. You two seem close. We're going with another chef for the restaurant. Oh, Connor, I was just headed to the grill. Look, we need to talk. Yeah, I'd say so. You used me. What? Bianca just told me she's going with another chef. I only found out a few hours ago, okay? I had no idea she would do that. Did you get Rome? So I helped you get everything that you wanted, and... I'm just a fool with no restaurant, chasing a boyhood crush. No. Connor, I'm so sorry! Me too. ‐ He hates me, Marnie. You should've seen his face. Trust me, he doesn't hate you. He's just upset. I can't imagine this hotel opening without him. Well, is there any way you can get Bianca to change her mind? No, I don't think so. It's her company. It's her choice. Yeah, but you're the one that came up with the idea of the Christmas Hotel, not her. Erin, there you are. Where else would I be? ‐ We need to head out right now. ‐ What's wrong? With the investment secured, we have to get to Rome for a meeting about the new hotel location. If we don't leave ASAP, we could lose the property. ‐ Right now? ‐ Yes. I've booked our flights for tonight. Tonight? What about Christmas Hotel? The grand opening is tomorrow. Marnie and her staff can handle everything. The hard work here is done. We've got the money, and the opening is just fluff. The most important thing is securing the Rome hotel. You of all people should know that. Be ready to leave in an hour. Hey. How you doing? You don't look so good. Um... I just found out I'm leaving. What? Yeah. I'm going to Rome. Oh. But I really need to speak to Connor. Oh, he's not around. Do you know where he is? He said he was running some errands like in Montpelier. Okay, well, when will he be back? I don't know. I can't believe I have to go after the way we left things. Just, um, tell him I said sorry, and that, uh, you know, I'll... I'll try and call. I will. Penny... Thank you... for everything, okay? Hey, you know where I'll be. Don't be a stranger. Yeah, I won't. Bye. Maybe once I get settled in, you guys can come and visit. ‐ Yeah. ‐ I'd like that. I do like pizza. You know, Italy. I'm sorry this is all so sudden. ‐ Oh. ‐ Oh, baby. I'm gonna miss you. It's okay, it's okay. Take care. Oh, and, honey... just remember this will always be your home. Yeah. ‐ Okay. ‐ I love you. ‐ Love you too. ‐ I love you too. Aw, it's okay. This isn't good. Apparently, winter storm Megan is blowing in, and it's grounding all the flights. Well, maybe we can stay. You know, we can still make the opening. Don't be silly. I'll see if I can't get us a charter flight. I'm not going. What? I don't wanna go to Rome. You're the executive manager. You have to. I can't accept the job. I wanna be in Garland Grove, and I wanna be the executive manager of the Christmas Hotel. Permanently. You are joking. I grew up in Garland Grove, and it wasn't until I came back that I truly learned to appreciate its magic. It's a part of who I am, and I'm proud of that. You can never have too much Christmas in your life because it's about more than just one day. It's about sharing love with your friends and your family every day. I... I don't know what to say. You could say that even though I'm turning down the Rome position, you'll still make me manager of the Christmas Hotel. Okay, yes. Uh... All right, um... As the manager of the Christmas Hotel, I'd like to hire Connor to be chef of the Christmas Cafe. He is the best person for the job. I stake my reputation on that. Okay. ‐ Okay? ‐ Mm‐hmm. Good! Bianca, I promise you... I will make this the best Christmas Hotel there ever was. I'm sorry, we're closed. Everybody's at the... Erin. I thought you left. I came back. Why? Because I'm now the executive manager of the Christmas Hotel. And as manager, my first order of business is rehiring you as head chef of the Christmas Cafe. What about Bianca? I told her the truth. That I wanna stay in Garland Grove. She was surprised, but she got on board. So... you in? I'm in. So this means you're technically my boss. You okay with that? As long as I can still do this. Yes, you can. Well, I guess that we have a hotel opening to get to. Um, can I have everyone's attention, please? I, uh... I had to leave this place twice to realize how much I never want to leave it again. Aw... The reason Garland Grove is special is not because it's so good at Christmas. It's because of all of you. You all embody what Christmas means each and every day, and you helped me rediscover my Christmas joy. So, um, I'm proud to say... that I am staying. And I will be manager here at the Christmas Hotel. ‐ Oh! ‐ Yeah! ‐ Oh, my... ‐ Yes! So it is my pleasure to announce that our Christmas Hotel is officially open for business! Oh, my God. Can you believe this? Oh, baby! Is this real? You're staying? Yes. Now, I'll probably be getting my own place. ‐ What? ‐ Well, yeah. But I'm here to stay. This is the best present ever! Well, I'm happy that you finally came to your senses. ‐ Me too. ‐ Oh. Well... What are you thinking about? I was thinking about my favorite Christmas memory. What's that? This.
