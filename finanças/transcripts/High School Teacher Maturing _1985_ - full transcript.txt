Saeko Kuga Toshiyuki Kitami Joji Nakata Saeko Kuga Toshiyuki Kitami Joji Nakata Kosuke Yoda Kunpei Sakamoto Shinpachi Mitani Directed by Shogoro Nishimura What do you want, Ms. Ishima? I forgot my chalk case, sorry. On purpose? Don't mind us, please. I want you, Ms. Ishima. Good morning. Hey, could you fuck me? I see, I'm bothering you. Alright, nevermind. Something happened? If you don't fuck me, I'm not telling you! Could you lower your voice? The students are constantly teasing me. They're teenagers. The only female teacher... What? This school is flooded with their sperm. You know how teenaged boys are. There are 624 of them and you're the only female. I don't want to be the whore they fantasize about! All these teenage boys idolize you, Kayoko. Ouch! Come visit me tonight. I heard you're engaged. I know about it. It's not like that. So she's just a lover... and I'm another one. Hello, Ms. Ishima speaking. Ms. Ishima, I wanna fuck you. I wanna fuck you so hard... Who is this? Ms. Ishima, I wanna fuck you. I wanna fuck you so hard... Please stop this! Yes, Ms. Asakura speaking. It's me, could you come over? What do you mean "be clear"? Stop playing with me like this. I'm not playing with you, Yumi! I'm a total mess. When I meet you, I get so confused. I'll be waiting. Hey. - Do you have a guest? - No. I want you to fuck me. Hurry up and do it. Do I smell of sperm? What? That weird smell. You're not wearing your stockings? They've been harassing me. You've been assaulted? They're all after me. If you don't take me, someone else will. Switch on the light. I'm afraid of the dark. I feel so lonely lately. Look at my face. Stick a finger in my ass. It's the same smell. Huh? All men have this same smell. Smells like chestnut flower. - Somebody is here. - I know. Were you expecting someone? - It's all your fault. - Why? Because I called you earlier and you didn't answer. So you called someone else instead? If you had a girl here... why did you ask me to come? Are you doing this to discourage me? I like you both. Who is she? She's a teacher. I'm not asking that. Who is she to you? I just told you. I like you both. That can't be. But it's the truth. Who was the first one? What do you want? Who did you sleep with first? I both met you recently anyway. So... what am I to you? I won't marry you. But I spoke about you... to my mother already. So what? You're everything I have. Why don't you want to marry me? How about her? You'll marry her? I'm not marrying anyone. I hate to be cornered. Idiot! You're supposed to run after her. Otherwise she'll kill herself? Of course, she will. If I go after her she wins and I'm trapped. Or she may come back with a kitchen knife. She moved me to tears. But you were cheating on her. You break people's hearts. Are you gonna cry too? Me? I don't cry. No man ever made me cry. I'm taking some days off starting tomorrow. Please tell everyone at school. What? You're fed up with me now? And with the students. Oh, you're rejecting the whole school now? Tell them it's a nervous breakdown. I heard female teachers quit all the time. What are you gonna do? You see, I have another boyfriend... but he's married. Yes, this is the Miharu Inn. Oh, Kayoko! It's been a while! My husband? Ever since the incident, he's living like a recluse. I'm not feeling too good either. It's my head. No, inside my head. I'm coming by your place. Do you have a room? Yes, I need a change of air. Sorry I didn't call ahead. See you! You have no other guests this week? Well, the season is over for now. Your tea. You're perfect as a young wife. Well, he inherited. It's a nice life. It suits you so well to be settled. But your visit here is unsettling me. What does Kunio do, now that he quit his school? You've come to ask him for professional advice? No. You need his comfort. You can't, he's mine now. Yours, right. He's in the garden. You might see him. What a cheerful recluse! Hey! A surprise visit? It's great, right? What is? You looked like a real gardener. I'm just pruning, nipping the young weeds in the bud. What? Like those young boys killed back then. Like I told the judge at the trial. There was an intent to kill. That's what they said in the newspapers. I wasn't up for the challenge posed by school gangs. - Kayoko. - Yes? You think you have a duty to guide them, right? - I'm not saying that. - But you believe it. That's why you're mentally exhausted. The younger you are, the stupider you are. Youth has to be quickly pruned. Kunio, you're drunk. It's great to see the woman who rejected me suffer like this. Excuse him. I wish we were back to college. We were so keen on grabbing the boys. Such passion. You see... I liked you more than I liked Shizuko. Why? Because you offered yourself to me. That's awful. And you were not talking about marriage. Unlike me. I'm full of regrets. So you want a divorce? I'm not the type who divorces. Idiot. What is this? Let's have a baby, OK? No, what are you doing? Kunio, what are you doing? Let me go. Stop. Your bed is ready in the next room. Enough, stop. You're hurting me. Let me go! Stop. - No. - Shizuko. No, don't! Stop it! Let's make a baby. Let's make a baby. No. Kunio. Are you sure you can't stay longer? Do you feel healed? Two days aren't enough to heal... How is Kunio? You know how he is. That's a painful condition. If only a bandage on your head could help. I couldn't sleep at night. Yes, you always had a light sleep. And you were quite vocal. That's embarrassing. I could have walked to the station. No, it's too far. See you. Come anytime. You have headaches, nausea and dizziness, right? Eh? Your symptoms. They come specifically when you think about school. - It was an excuse. - Huh? I came to see you. She was right. Huh? She allowed me to be with you for the day. Is that a joke? She knew and she was really nervous. And now what? I can't get her out of my mind. Does your wife keep your balls in her purse? It's something I hate to admit sometimes. Doesn't it feel strange? What? Doesn't it remind you of our teenage passion? This time you can't ask me to marry you. Do you have a boyfriend? A lover. You love him? I have no intention to marry him. Someone who thinks like you, then. Let's enjoy ourselves. No. Just like we used to be. Now you want to run quickly, right? Is that how he treats you? I have to share him with another woman. Goodbye, sir. So you're not with her? - Thank you. - Goodbye, sir. Don't make a scene here. Why are you following me? That's the way it is. Is she coming back today? Working overtime? She took a few days off. Why? She's sick. What's wrong? Female teachers tend to quit during their first days. Her private school grants her any freedom she desires. She's cheating on you already. You idiot! I'm not obsessed with marriage like you. She's with you all day anyway. You can make plans with her anytime. Yumi. Stop crying! You're so nice when you don't badger me. I'll never stop. Marry me! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me! Marry me! No! You have to marry me first. Then get out! No... This is one of her hairs, isn't it? I'll eat it. Don't be stupid. No... Marry me! From the Students at Toyo School Ms. Ishima we miss you so much! Let us gang-bang you... Now, I'm definitely sick. My stalker's moving in. Do you have to be so mean? If you call your mom, tell her I said hi. How about your responsibility? What responsibility? She's just borrowing a drawer. Now my sweet privacy is under siege. Is that how you see me? Poor thing! Don't talk to her like that. What about me? I'm the "poor thing" here. Stop crying! Go wash your face. I could fuck you right here and that wouldn't discourage her. Not too smart. Why is that? A scorned woman is unpredictable. We see the result here. What do you mean? - May I watch TV? - Yeah. A man fucks any ass he can grab. You'll be here with me all day. Great idea. She'll get fed up before I do. At least we'll put an end to this farce. You hate woman but you love sex. Huh? I'm talking about you. You're the same. You hate men and you love sex. Would you like to live with me? How about it? I don't mind. Sorry, I need my private world. You mean a married life? I hate the privacy of marriage. We came to visit you. That's so nice of you. Come. Does the doctor let you go out? Yes, I went to the hospital. Please come in. Please. Thank you. - Are you a smoker, Ms. Ishima? - I am. Could we have one? - You could get expelled. - If no one tells... - Please. - Thank you. You look like a fool. Ah, I wanted to ask. I received this letter. We didn't send it. That's right, we didn't. Who could it be? We didn't send it but... I guess all the boys feel the same. - Miss. - Yes. What's your illness exactly? It was a lie, right? I didn't lie. We don't trust female teachers. They always leave and they despise us. I'm not like that! The truth is, we'd like to have sex with you. We didn't write that letter, but we came looking for sex. Hurry UP! Leave now. What are we supposed to do? We'll be expelled. We don't care about that school. Don't worry, I won't have you expelled. That school is probably your last chance. Just go home now. Who is it? I can't sleep. I remember... a boy stabbed you when you were a teacher. Yes. Today, I nearly tried to kill myself with a knife. High school students are obsessed with sex. I can't blame them. I'm just like them. Fuck me. You should quit your job. What else would I do? Just find a husband. Please put it in. Forget it. Do you hate me? Don't! I'm unclean. What's wrong? You're bleeding. It's gross. It's fine. No big deal. Please go ahead. Please take me. You could have fucked me instead. You were awake? It's just that I can't sleep. You keep thinking about Shizuko, right? When I'm with her, I keep thinking about you. - You chose. - How about you? I lost my appetite lately. I see. How about a beef stew? Thank you, sir. There's something I'd like to ask. What? I'd like to keep seeing you even if I'm married. Are you sure? It's difficult. It's difficult indeed. I brought you a bream. It was still alive a while ago. It was thrashing around on the train. I got scared. Your beef stew just turned into a bream stew. It's not good when it's overcooked. Yeah. You looked great. You two, walking like a couple. I felt so redundant all of a sudden. Guys, if you don't eat, I have to switch it off. I thought... I'd wait at home. But, you see... Heated you'd never come back. It's the first time you don't sleep at home. I'm glad you broke out of your reclusion. I'm suffering. I thought that... with our marriage, I had won over Kayoko. - Kayoko. - Yes. Please, get married. Then it will be easier for me to accept your affair. You don't have to accept it. I'm not talking to you. Please don't patronize me. I'm going back. Wait! You can stay if you like. I don't like your tone! Stop it! I want to go back. - Go back and then what? - Get off me. You'll go back and wait for me. You'll wait for me all your life. Look at you, acting as a martyr. You're hurting me now. Are you guys done with your lover's spat? It was just a fuck. You're indecent. He can think what he wants, to me he's just a fuck... - ... like all the others. - Stop that. Don't air your dirty laundry here. Your domestic bickering is boring. I'm sorry. It doesn't suit you to apologize. How's your girlfriend? Don't bother me with her. How about I move in with you? You wanna cook for us? What? You wanna cook for us? What do you mean? I quit my teaching job. Huh? She decided I was her husband... and even secretly registered our marriage. Now she has a bun in the oven. She's tenacious, I'll grant her that. Give me a fucking break! Marriage... and now a kid? I'm dead. What's the next step? I can't even walk anymore. I feel you. It doesn't work anymore. I thought I'd get you drunk to go to your place. Won't happen. You're just too kind, Kayoko. No, I'm not. Won't work. Come on. I'm so wet... You can't miss this chance! Still, it ain't working. See? Your dick begs to differ. Hey, I'll walk you home. I like you. Ms. Ishima, I like you. Ms. Ishima, would you marry me? I can't do that! Wave many students to take care oi. Ms. Ishima! THE END
