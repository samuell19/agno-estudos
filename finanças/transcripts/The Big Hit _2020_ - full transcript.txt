Thank you. - Phone in a locker. - Ok. - Wait for the head warder. - Ok. Cells? No, offices. Keep the pass visible. - Your first time inside? - Yes. It'll go well. Based on a true story Hello. - Lieutenant. - Hello. Mr. Fortineau! - Coming? - Yes. Your hat. Take the hat off. - I have sinusitis. - Off! Good luck. Hand it over. 3 days. - I can't yet. - You promised. I promised? I did 3 days. Hello. Cut it out, man. I'm the new theatre guy. And the others? In their cells. - Are they coming? - No. Stéphane pissed us off with his fables. - We want to do comedy. - Stand-up. Hi, guys. Mr. Lazy! Hello, sir. Doing ok? - What's up? - High? Stoned. Look at his eyes. - Wasted? - Yeah. - I'm Etienne, an actor. - On TV? - Sometimes. - Never seen you. C'mon, a star wouldn't be here! - We're doing stand-up. - Yeah? I'm not into sketches, I do theatre. Comic theatre? That too. So you're a funny guy? Sometimes. - But you're tense now. - I'm not. - You are. - Good pay? No, look at his shoes! What brand's your bag? Oxfam? Alright, have you finished? Don't get upset, we joke a lot. Alright then... Show us your stand-up act. - Show him. - Go on, wise guy. I'm not warmed up. Give us a laugh. Drop it. So who's funny here? - Jojo's the best. - I'm not. You're the funny one. No one, then. The Hare and the Tortoise. Rushing is useless. One must leave on time, as the Hare and the Tortoise show. I wager that you won't reach... Sit down! Leave him. He made it all up! I wager that you won't reach... Sit down! Sit! He's trying. Your name? I'm Jordan. Learn anything? No, the other guy kept pissing me off. What fable? It was.... - Dickhead. - Shut up. The Lion and the Mouse. Can you recite it? No. You, then. Patrick. The Hare and the Tortoise. Worked in jail before? Yes, a little. - Where? - Vaulx-en-Velin. There's no jail there. It was a young offenders' center. Ok... It's not the same. I hope you'll do a good show. Five sessions aren't much. It's not easy, but be ready. There'll be sponsors, a foundation for projects... Make it good. - Try to lure the others back. - I'll try. Hopeless. They're like rocks and want to do stand-up. - Motivate them. - With fables? Fables are great, there's a moral. - It worked for me. - So you say. - Always moaning. - Not when I act. You said I'd be Lopakhine! Five years ago. Things change. I have auditions. Quit if you want. But don't come to me again. Hi, how is everyone? Welcome. How are you? Ok, Agathe? There's a lion. He's tangled up in a net, and there you go. - That's all? - There's more. He gets all worked up, it's busting his balls. Then he spots a tiny mouse. - A mouse passing by. - No, a rat. Screw you. A rat. "For pity's sake, can you help me get out of this fucking net?" The mouse says, "No, are you kidding? You're a lion, a warm-blooded reptile. You'll trick me." The mouse comes over, not totally at ease, like. She starts nibbling at the net. The lion gets out, really grateful. "Thanks a million!" He shakes her paw, hits the mouse and eats her, the fuck! Who says he eats her? Who says that? That's not how it ends. - The cat eats the weasel. - It's shit! I read the story, that's how it ends. One often needs someone smaller. Thanks, Yoda. I always learned big guys eat little guys, it's natural. - You're not wrong. - Yoda... Hello. Very good! Once again, more warrior-like. Think of the competition, ok! - Hello. - Hi, boss. You do the fables? - What's your name? - Traoré, Moussa. You're alone? Yes. - Know one? - The Milkmaid and the Pot of Milk. Alright. Perrette, a pot of milk on a cushion on her head, was on her way to town... I've been waiting half an hour. And me seven years, man! I'm not here to wait. Make that fuck come on time! - All we do is wait. - All the time. For visits, exercise, family... We wait for each day, then for that day to end. And we wait to get out. Got a fable about that? Your voice, deeper. I don't do deep. Deep blubber! It's breathing. Use the diaphragm, it's what helps you breathe. Put your hand here. I relax my belly... That's a gnu now! Try it. Relax. Now do a cow. Relax your belly. Relax it. Let out your breath. This is too weird! I look dumb. You suck! Breathing matters. When you're on stage, the diaphragm is at work. 2 WEEKS Ladies and gentlemen, The Hare and the Tortoise. Rushing is useless. One must leave on time as the Hare and the Tortoise show. Isis, what's in the bag? Madam Tortoise... This sucks! "Let's wager..." You will not reach the goal sooner than me. "You must be mad," quipped the light-footed one. Mr. Hare... Since he had time to nibble grass, to sleep, to listen to the wind, he let the tortoise advance at her steady pace. Not bad for such philistines. Bravo, you did well. I could invite them to my theatre. I'm kidding, of course. Hi, Dad, it's me. I thought you'd forgotten me. C'mon, I'm calling you. - What are you doing? - Eating. How about work-wise? Not a lot. Just stuff to pay the bills. And you? Great, I found a job in a restaurant. I'll be working weekends. That's good. You'll still visit your old dad? It's kind of tricky right now, but I'm seeing Mom in Partage de Midi. Want to come? I'm not keen on Claudel... Come, please. It'd make her so happy. Would Tuesday suit you? Earth to Dad... I don't know. I'll call you. Keep me posted. I'm counting on you to come. Ok. Love you. - Love you too. - Tuesday, ok? It's a pretty riverside spot. Just tidy it up. Raze these old buildings. Raze the old house and the cherry orchard. - The cherry orchard? - Turn. My dear, you don't realize. The most remarkable thing around here is our cherry orchard. It's only remarkable for its size. It only gives... cherries every two years. - What's next? - No idea. And when it does, we have a glut. Why're you here? Ask if you need help. I'm doing fine, thanks. - Here? - Where else? - The programme's full. - You close on Mondays. - I rest on Mondays. - Rest later. This could be huge. Waiting for Godot by prisoners discovering Beckett. They're not actors. And you don't direct. Give me six months. Six months for Godot? Really? Reread it, it was written for them. They know about waiting. They're tragic and burlesque too, the lot. But not talented. You said the other day how they surprised you! Not one of your actors surprises me! - Quiet... - You said, "We can't do what they do." - I didn't. - You did. With different words. You're too much. - Have you asked Ariane? - She's all for it. The judge too, everyone. - It depends on you. - What can I say? Maybe. I'm rehearsing! What'll it cost you? Give me one Monday! You're hurting me. Are you nuts? We'll talk about it. - Tomorrow then. - Not tomorrow. I agree in principle. But calm down. You never change. Your stage costume? Yeah, why? Good pockets for your lines. Ok, bye. Yeah, bye. - See you Monday. - Right. Agathe! Take how many out? Five, no more. In 6 months. So, six months of rehearsals? Exactly. 3 times a week. At first. - How many hours? - 338. For 5 prisoners? - How can I justify that? - Easy. They'll represent all the others. Fables are fine, but we can do better. Imagine the impact. - It'll be huge. - Stéphane agrees? He loves it. We can use his theatre. Exit permits are hard to get. The sentencing judge has to decide. She's no theatre fan. I'll talk to her. No. Let me handle it. So what do you want to stage? Samuel Beckett, the 20th century's greatest playwright. - He's dead? - 30 years ago. Waiting for Godot is the absurd masterpiece. It's been staged worldwide. In Arabic? Yes. Arabic, Chinese... - Sure. - It's true. - Freaky eyes. - The guy's a genius. - Those eyes... - What a face. He won the Nobel Prize. Wasn't it... What's the cocksucker's name? Einstein won the Nobel Prize. - He did too. - Screw the Nobel Prize. Nobel Prize, respect. - No Ballon d'Or. - I'll read. You said it's absurd. So we do something meaningless? It's a play about life's absurdity. When you wake up, don't you wonder what your life here means? I smoke a big spliff and chill. If you start thinking, you won't see the day out. You blow a fuse. Life isn't here, it's outside. This is an interlude. A shitty interlude. Life can be absurd outside. Yeah, it's absurd, but I'd rather be absurd outside than unabsurd inside. You understand. Hey, Etienne, I don't smoke. Let's work. Move the table. - Let's go. - We can't. Why not? We're waiting for Godot. You're sure it was here? What? Where we wait. He said by the tree. See any others? What is it? I don't know. A willow. Where are the leaves? Vladimir and Estragon go on. Estragon? That's a spice! - Can we change the name? - No. You now. I don't get it. The guy, Godot, does he turn up at the end? No, he sends a kid to say he can't come. - Why not? - It's a mystery. They wait in vain. Why don't they call him? No phones then. They're weird, staying. They stay because it's absurd. - Maybe he'll give them work. - That's hope. You wait. That's why I'm in France and want to stay. The day you get out, it's back to Ouagadougou. Hope is absurd. - It's absurd. - So what do they do? They talk and argue like you. Pozzo arrives with his servant Lucky on a rope. This is trippy. Are you high? You wanted a fable on guys who do nothing but wait. - Fables have animals. - We're all animals. Wild beasts, that's why they caged us. What's the moral of this fable? - There isn't one. - No moral, no action, no beginning, no end, nothing! Cos it's absurd. Yes, and it's a comedy. They're funny, they're clowns. Let's take a vote. No, no voting. If you don't like it, stay in your cell. Screw this. Listen to what he says. You have to try it. Etienne... - What's in it for us? - Nothing. It's absurd. Give us a break. Aren't you going? Do we get reduced sentences? Not my decision. You'll be proud of yourselves. Back out now or commit to 6 months straight. Are you in? Jordan? No? Yes. We'll be using a real theatre. You'll perform, with sets, lights, costumes... There'll be an audience: your friends and family. But you'll need to work, work hard, learn your lines, stay focused and never lose heart. Do you trust me? Susie sitting in a shoe shine shop. Where she sits... She shines. You be the tree. - A cherry tree? - Fine. Use your arms as branches. - Why move? - The wind. No, it's sunny, birds sing... The thirty-three thieves fought... thought... What the hell? Nice cook... Nice cook... Nice cock... Eddie edited it, Eddie edited it... A bough? I wouldn't trust it. - We can always try. - Go ahead. After you. No, you first. Peter Piper picked a peck of pickled peppers. - Try it slowly. - I just did. Eddie edited it! Etienne! No worries. The thirty-three thieves thrilled the tone... throne... Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, what shall I say of today? 1 MONTH It hurts? He asks if it hurts! Talk to us, not the paper! Talk to us. You know the lines. Start from "hurts". It hurts? He asks if it hurts! - Better, huh? - Yes, but don't stop. Shut up and listen. Go on. No one ever suffers but you. I don't count. I'd like to hear what you'd say if you had what I have. You're angry. Don't laugh. Angry, ok. Think of your life here. A pal comes to visit and complains. "It's tough..." You're in jail! How do you answer? I'd like to hear what you'd say in my shoes. - True. - So find the truth in your life. The truth is in your lives. Jordan, get it? Truth in your lives. I never get visits. Time's up, gents. Not until 6 pm. In cells by 6. Alright. Remember to learn your lines. I mean it, Nabil. Boss... Thanks for Vladimir. What did you do before? I sold books. Novels, literature... - In a bookstore? - No. Outside hotels. - Like a dealer. - Yes. Only I dealt in stories. - It's not why you're here? - No. I fought with an Afghan and it ended badly. Mr. Traoré, it's time. Off you go. - Good luck. - Goodbye. Excuse me, sir. Can I have a word? I wanted to say I saw your fable show. It was fantastic. Thanks. I really mean it. I hear you're putting on Waiting for Godot by Mr. Samuel Beckett. - You know it? I know everything here. Got a part for me? - No, I have my cast. - Try auditioning me. Let's not waste our time on vain speeches. Let us do something as the opportunity arises. It's not every day that we're needed. You've read it? - In one go. - Pity... It's too late now. Never mind. Things can change around here. You have my number. My prisoner number. I'm Kamel! Kamel Beckett! We finish at 6. But they come for them at 5:30. I did 45 minutes today! Things take time in prison. Tell the warders to be on time. They have a lot to deal with. Visits, exercise periods, sport... - Always on the move. - I'll start at 3. - No budget for that. - So what do I do? Have you picked the right play? I read it and you're aiming very high. After fables, tales? Puss in Boots, Red Riding Hood? Oh, please... - I don't want them to fail. - Me neither. I'll lift them up. I need an extra hour. I'll see what I can do. Thank you. - Ok? - Yeah, and you? Fine. Where's Jordan? Dunno. - Where is he? - No idea. Finished, sir? Yes. Let's get started. A drunken Englishman goes to a brothel. The bawd offers him a fair one, a dark one or a red- haired one. - Good! Exit. The wings. Follow but stay here. Come back, Moussa. Excuse me. Can you sit? Have you finished? That's better. The script. This is over. Speak louder, it's a big theatre. So project. Let's carry on. You wanted to talk? You had something to say? - I've nothing to say. - You're angry? A beat. You're angry? A beat... Forgive me. Another beat. Take your time. You know time here. Go on. - You're angry? - No. That's my line! The tone was right. Very real. Carry on. Forgive me. Come on, Didi. Your hand. Embrace me. Are they gay? Don't be ridiculous. - I say they're gay. - Etienne knows. - Go on. - There's no chicks. Here neither. There are pics of chicks in all the cells. - Your wife in the raw. - Asshole. Cut it out. Carry on. I don't do gay. What's this about? Two losers hoping for a brighter future. Get that? Who cares if they're gay? "I don't know who Godot is or if he exists." Beckett said that. Working with these guys, I feel I know more than him. Understand? I've played it. I thought I knew it. With them, it's full of meaning. It's enlightening. How many shows? One, in theory. That's all? It's a reintegration thing? No, it's theatre. You say you're directing. I am directing. So it lets you reintegrate in the profession too. That's mean. I'm kidding. Sorry. What did they do? No idea. - We don't mention it. - No one said? I don't want to know. When you go out, there'll be a police escort? - Just two warders. - That's all? What if they escape? They're at the end of their stretches. It'd be crazy. It's good for them. It's a trust thing. Ten to a cell and you're the safety valve. What do you mean? Long stretches get single cells. If bringing them culture makes me a safety valve, I'm proud to be one. - Why get mad? - It's ambitious. And useful too. Good. Forgive me. How do they act? They sound false. But there's a truth to them. You can perform right but be totally false. The opposite of true isn't always false. You can also be right by being true. I prefer true by being false rather than right... They will be. - What? - Right. And true as well. You'll see. Bread? Please. - When is it? - June. Shit, during my exams. Exams aren't at night. I revise at night. Want to do a mountain hike? With me? The lake route. It'll clear your mind. Sure, but when? A weekend, maybe. I work at weekends. Always working. We do nothing together. I'm funding my uni. You could have come to see Mom with me. Don't you revise at night? Ok, drop it. 2 MONTHS No, four times "qua". Quaquaquaqua with white beard... Yo, bitches! What's up, motherfucker? Learning to read? Fucking jokers. Forget them. ...quaqua with white beard, quaqua outside... outside time... Fuck. Of the divine... Go on. From the heights... Motherfucker! I can't understand it! Fuck this. C'mon... From the heights... Jordan, come back! ...who from the heights of divine... of divine athambia divine aphasia What the fuck's "aphasia"? Isn't it a country? It's theatre of the absurd. Carry on. - Jordan has his lawyer too? - No, his mom's sick. - So? - It bugs him. You'd come if yours was sick? - Sure. - It's your job, not ours. Brooding in his cell won't cure his mom! Shit! Thanks, warder. Hello. Sorry I'm late. Ok, man? - Why are you here? - To work. - Move over. - Ok. Work on what? I'm here for Estragon. The play. Remember Kamel Beckett? I don't understand. I worked it out with Nabil. It's all settled. - What do you mean? - I'm helping out. Where? The far end. Box A. Nabil! What is this shit? I quit, I'd rather work. - Why? - I just don't want to. You were loving it! Don't piss me off, ok. Kamel agreed. Screw Kamel. It's two months' work! Nabil! You'd rather peel onions? Right. Work on your part, Nabil. Louder. Where do we come in? Speak clearly. Come on. Speak clearly! - Again. - Where do we come in? Breathe, dammit! Can't you breathe? Show him how, Moussa. From your belly, like this. Alright. Take it from the top. I can't hear you! It's marked "anxious". Can't you read? Watch it, Etienne. - Start again! - Watch your tone. I'm the director here. You want to act? You do as I say. Start again. And we? Go on. And we? Pardon? - And we? - I don't understand. - Where do we come in? - Come in? - Take your time. - Come in? - On our knees. - As bad as that? Your Worship has his prerogatives? We've no rights? That's it, good! From the top again. Take it from the top. - And we? - Pardon? Louder, Kamel. I said, and we? - Why do you want to act? - I love Beckett. The real reason? - Asked the others? - They've been here all along. Ok... You call that the real reason? - Will you get an exit permit? - I'm a model prisoner. Listen, we're a company. And I'm in charge. We see this through? - Deal? - You'll take me on? Can you do a monkey? Afraid of ridicule? The lines suck, the rope sucks, the play sucks... So I replace you? I won't speak. I'll do it in mime. No way. Your monologue is the most powerful moment! Lucky opens his mouth for the first time in years. The words tumble out. - It's too long! - The others have more lines. Screw them. I try to learn but it won't register. Stop smoking. Screw you, ball-buster! Come back. I'm here for you. Piss off! Shit, sorry, Etienne. What's going on here? - We're rehearsing. - You're bleeding? I tripped up. - Let's go, Fortineau. - We have 10 minutes left. 10 minutes. Thank you. Sit down. - Row. - It's no use. Take this and row. It'll calm you. Row! Go on, row. Faster. Row! Faster. Come on, speed it up. Your lines: Given the existence... in the public works of Puncher and Wattmann of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard... Clearer! From the heights... From the heights of divine apathia divine athambia Speak clearly! Come on! Loves us dearly... Loves us dearly... Loves us dearly... for reasons unknown... for reasons unknown... but time will tell plunged in torment fire and flames will blast hell to heaven so blue! Good, Jordan. You wanker. Take it easy! There's no time to waste! Chicago gangsters! It's kind of old style. Like in that series. - The Joker! - Like this? Guys. - Wait for it... - Food? You're wild. A real crook! Forget the rope. Bring hash instead. - The rope's settled. - I won't use it. - Etienne! - Any other props? I have my character. Excellent! - Sébastien... - Stop drooling. The pipe works for Pozzo. Keep the hat. You look wonderful. Gentlemen, I am happy to have met you. Yes, yes, sincerely happy. Closer! Stop! Yes, the road seems long when one journeys alone for... yes, six hours, that's right, six hours on end, and never a soul in sight. Excellent, Patrick! They're good, huh? Like that. Put the bag down. Take the coat. Stand. Whip in your teeth. In the teeth. Coat. Take the coat. Put the coat on. And you, don't forget, he's the local landowner. Look impressed. Give me an impressed look. Very good. You too. That's impressed? Your eyes don't show it. Be impressed. Think of the judge. - Not impressed? - I like him. He likes him. Boiko here, doesn't he impress you? The cleaning lady? What? Say it in French. Talking to me, bitch? Bitch? Me? Ok, that's enough! Calm down. - Good looker. - Stop! No one impresses you. Truth is, someone does, my mom. She impresses me. Laugh and you die. Got that? Calm down. Enough, Kamel. Let's act. Start all over again. From the top. I don't remember what I said, but you may be sure there wasn't a word of truth in it. Do I look like a man that can be made to suffer? - Well? - You act really well, honey. He said I was brilliant. Brilliant, he said. I adore you. Nothing you can do about it. One is what one is. - No use wriggling. - Nothing changes. I have a rope around my neck and Pozzo pulls me. Like a mutt? No, don't piss me off. The character has a rope round his neck. Nothing to be done. Like to finish it? I give him the carrot. That's when you hear Pozzo's hideous cry ring out. Estragon freezes, turns back for the carrot... He pockets it. Vladimir waits. Estragon joins him. Come on, Patrick. How's Martine? You fucked her? Pozzo turns up with Lucky. Here you go. Lucky enters first. Jordan, hurry up. Lucky and Pozzo... I'm an Indian, not a cowboy? This is all I had, sorry. Just take it. Faster! Faster! Why that voice? It's the cowboy's voice. - So? - A cowboy. Basket! Stop it! Stop it! What is this? It's a rehearsal. Eat! Think, pig! Mr. Carboni, this isn't a theatre. It's a prison, with delinquents and criminals. Imagine the work it requires. You never watch the news? I fight to bring culture here, negotiating every inch of the way. - No one else believes in it. - I do. You're making my life hell! The chief warder's on my back! I have a new actor. Let's talk about him. Know why Mr. Jouhari quit? - He lost interest. - No, I'll tell you. Mr. Ramdane made him back out and give him the part. You don't refuse a boss here. Kamel may seem nice enough, but he's a hardened criminal! The visiting room was his idea? There, I knew it. - Replace him. - The guy who's read it? A guy like him has to be up to something. He's a manipulator, a problem. My problem is finding actors and he's good. He may not get an exit permit! You'll plead his case. Who says I will? I'm asking you to, for the show. You never give up. I warned you anyhow. The next problem, you come to me. I have one. I need to rehearse every day. - Is that all? - No. In the auditorium. Very good. Put the coat on. Up! Help! - Kamel. - I don't know. That's not what I said. Start again and focus! You're not focused. Help! No, it's Moussa now. Later, later... No, that's not it. No, you say it twice. It's Stéphane. Is everything going ok there? If it's too tough, tell me. I don't want a crap show. I'd rather cancel in that case. Call me. 4 MONTHS You skipped two pages, Moussa. You don't know it. - We do. - You only think you do. You trip over words, skip lines, miss marks. Jordan, you forgot it all. We can't understand his prompts. You shouldn't need prompts! I keep saying it. - It has to be fluid and rapid. - What's up? I've carried you for months. I won't be on stage. Work together. You've nothing else to do. - Saying that cos we're cons? - What? It's insulting. Insulting? Insulting? For me, you're actors. - I defend you. - That's easy. - What's up? - Manage alone! Etienne... 5 of you benefit from this project. 5 out of 500. Know how lucky you are? Ever thought how hard Mr. Carboni is working? What we had to do to set it up? You'll even be paid to act. That's a first. Etienne demanded it. I'm sick of this. Go back to your cells. - Ma'am... - The warders will love it. - We don't want to stop. - No? Where are you? Where were you when he left? We were here. - Come on, show me. - Here. Pity! Pity! What is it? Were you asleep? I must have been. That bastard Pozzo again. Let's let him sleep. He wants to know what happened. Leave him in peace! Etienne, it's Ariane. What do we do? Are you quitting or carrying on? Know what Jordan said? You're changing his life. There. So, please call me back. I don't know what to do. Good night. But, behind this veil of gentleness and peace, night is charging and will burst upon us. Like that! Just when we least expect it. That's how it is on this bitch of an earth! So long as one knows. One can bide one's time. One knows what to expect. No further need to worry. Simply wait. Go, the Godots! So, gentlemen, how did you find me? Good? Fair? Very good! Very good! Very, very good. Poor? Positively bad? Oh very good, very, very good. Clam up, Killian! I have such need of encouragement! I heard you, Ahmad, you trannie! I weakened a little towards the end. You didn't notice? Just a teeny bit. Fucking bastards! Go, Godots! Up! Pig! Raise him up! - He's doing it on purpose! - He always does. Up, scum! Help me! Let go of him, ok! Hey, what's up with you? Go on, piss them off. Cut it out now. - Pig! - Perhaps he's dead. Maybe he's dead, man! Raise him up. Leave us be, jerk. Don't push us. You like blowing kids! - What? - You blow kids! Fucking bitch! Mr. Carboni? Jordan's illiterate, but he learned a 3-page monologue. It's like Everest. Three pages impossible to perform. It took him months. Now, he's ready. He's immature, impulsive, but he's turning into a real actor. He'll surprise you. Ok, but this isn't the Conservatoire. I'd rather he surprised me with his conduct. Nothing better than the stage. That's hard to believe. When I mentioned Everest, they're all climbing it. Me too, roped up with them. It's dumb to stop with the summit in sight. And Patrick Le Garrec? How's his climb going? 6 MONTHS My head's spinning. The wind has a taste. The wind has a taste, sir. Ok, gentlemen, let's go. See all this? You're freaking out. I freak out too when I act, but it's ok, the audience will laugh. You'll love it. It's a drug. So let yourselves go. If you forget a line, don't panic. Stay focused and, above all, the diaphragm! The diaphragm. I think that's all. One other thing... I was happy to work with you. You're great guys. So shit, shit, shit. Shit? Shit means luck in French theatre. Motherfucker! Asshole! Fucking bastard! - How's that? - "Shit" is better. - Motherfucker! - Son of a bitch! Shit. Shit! Asshole! Nina, it's me, where are you? It's about to start. Aren't you coming? Call me. - An actor's missing. - Who? Kamel. Etienne, what's going on? Is he there? Kamel, what's up? Are you injured or what? Where's Kamel? We have to go on. Get lost! Leave me alone. - What's up? - I'm not doing it! You can't do this. My brother's here! Let me handle it. Go to the stage. I'll handle it. Go to the stage. His bitch of a mom didn't bring him. Four years since I saw him. I wanted him to see me. It sucks... How old is he? He's 7. Haven't I shown you Nono? He was 4 in this photo. Handsome, isn't he? Very. That's why... I did it so he'd see me act. You act for yourself, not for someone else. - You can't miss this. - Screw it. Act. Do something. You'd let me read your part for you? Want to tell your son that? Kamel... Good evening and welcome. The actor due to play Estragon has a slight problem. He will be replaced by the director who will read the part. Please give them the warmest possible welcome. Remember to turn off your phones. Have a good evening and let the show begin. Don't worry, you'll be fine. Shit. See you later. It's ok. I'll do it. Your shoe. Your shoe. Shoe. Nothing to be done. I'm starting to think that. All my life, I've tried to ignore it, saying, "Vladimir, be reasonable, you haven't tried everything." And I resumed the struggle. So there you are again. - Am I? - Speak up! Can't hear you. I'm glad you're back. I thought you were gone forever. Me too. We'll have to celebrate this. - Get up, let me embrace you. - Not now. C'mon, Kamel. - Where did you sleep? - In a ditch! - Shit... - That's good. - What are you doing? - Removing my boot. Don't you do that? - It hurts? - Hurts! He asks if it hurts! Shit... Only you suffer. I don't count. I'd like to hear you if you had what I have. It hurts? He asks if it hurts! Charming spot. Inspiring prospects. You're on the other side! - I don't know my lines. - You do! I yell, but then what? Yell and it'll come back. Your lines are waiting. It's magical. Hurry! Nothing changes. It's no use! Like to finish it? Faster! Back! Let go and calm down. Careful! He's wicked with strangers! It's him. - Who? - You know. - Godot? - Yes. I present myself: Pozzo. - No! - He said Godot! You're not Mr. Godot? Pozzo. Don't you know the name? Does that name mean nothing to you? Pozzo... Let me see... Are you nuts? Think, hog! Stop! Step forward! Wait! Think! On the other hand with regard to... Lucky! Lucky, here! Get back on stage. Lucky! Back! Get back out there. No one's laughing. Pull, pull! He's too strong! Help me! Think! Think, hog! Help me! Yes, we'll help you. Lucky, come here! Up! Come on, think... Given the existence in the works of Puncher and Wattmann... Given, given, given, given, given, given, the existence in the works of Puncher and Wattmann... of a personal God quaquaquaqua with white beard outside time who from the heights of divine apathia loves us dearly time will tell and suffers like the divine Miranda who for reasons unknown are plunged in flames to fire the firmament... and blast hell to heaven so blue still and so calm with intermittent but good calm as a result of the labors left unfinished by the Acacacacademy of Anthropopopometry of Testew and Cunnard! It is established as follows... We'll hang ourselves tomorrow. Unless Godot comes. - If he comes. - We'll be saved. - Pull on your trousers. - What? - Pull on your trousers. - Pull them off? Pull on your trousers! True. - Shall we go? - Let's go. That was huge, man. A bigger buzz than a hold-up. Glad to hear it. Well done, guys. Etienne, thanks. It was awesome, totally wild. Thank you, Etienne. See this jerk turn up like Darth Vador! You're too much. - You're nuts. - I'm Godot! Beckett never wrote that. Give us a break. He's dead, we're alive. Bravo, that was a really great performance. Thanks, Stéphane. Fantastic. I don't know you. Well done. Thank you, Stéphane. I should thank you. Three cheers for Etienne! They're soft toys. Nothing inside. That's not dangerous. Into socks now? When do we get our gifts? Warder, answer me. No idea. Colleague! What's this scent? Let's go. - Can I keep my wife's flowers? - No, perishable. That's not nice for Martine. Warder... 6C. Next. It was important for me. It went well. Why did you miss it? I was revising. You could have tried! Dad, know what a Master's is? You still went to see your mom! It was the role of her life. You didn't even go. Screw Claudel. I'm in the nitty-gritty. Give me a break. You didn't do it for them. So? Can't I exist? No one wants me! Of course not, Dad, you're so full of rage and rancor... You sound like your mom. She's right. You're self-centred. Self-centred? You didn't even ask how my exams went. "We witness live the apt and truthful prisoners’ catharsis..." Listen to this. "The audience is struck: great theatre!" What do we do now? Etienne, we chipped in to get you a present. Get lost, I'm the one giving it! Calm down. That's kind. What is it? Open it. - We have other sizes. - No, it's good. - Happy? - Yes, I am. Thanks, Godots. Mr. Carboni. You're wanted. Come in. Etienne... - What's up? - Busy in September? - Busy? - Are you free? - Why? - Godot in Villefranche. Lorenzi loved it. He wants to schedule it. Next year's out, so it's for September. The judge agrees. That's not all. Machado called. He wants it too. In Annecy? And Grenoble's interested. - A major stage. - You'll be doing a tour. Bravo, man. Thank you. 9 MONTHS - Not bad. - Think so? A bit effeminate. - He slobbers. - Inevitable. - He foams. - Perhaps he's a halfwit. A cretin. He's blowing bubbles! That's disgusting! Bubbles... Leave him in peace! Can't you see he wants to rest? Leave him in peace. Alex! Come back! Not on stage! Can't you see he wants to rest? Go on, act! Carry on! No one was with it tonight. Jordan, you weren't there. Alex, I couldn't hear you. Patrick, I told you, stop staring at Martine. And the laughter... It was pathetic. A pro keeps going. We're not pros. You're paid, so you're pros. They laughed. At cons clowning around. I don't do reintegration, I do theatre. The audience must forget who you are. Think we can forget? We can't even buy cigarettes here. I'll split anytime. - So split. - Calm down. Respect us. You don't get searched after. They take everything. All the presents and my wife's flowers. We play the game, but get treated like shit. - The judge didn't even come. - Good job! The way you performed. Annecy has to be better. A lot better or we all look like shit. It's the rule. I can't ask the chief warder to suspend searches. - It's humiliating. - I agree. I'll talk to him. I don't get it... Are you the warden or not? Warders are different. They have their habits, their unions. They can lock the guys in if they want. It's not an easy job. So what use are you? I change things. Like right now. And was prison warden a childhood dream? I was a lawyer. I got sick of the routine. Court-appointed work, divorces... Mine included. So you found a gloomier job. No, I could have done tax law. But I feel better here. You're surprised? They were good tonight. Right, Hugo? - What did you think? - They were cool. I don't agree. You really are a pain. I bet Stéphane said that. A good actor too, he said. He's got a nerve. You did Godot together? Long ago. After the Conservatoire, he wanted his own theatre. I just wanted to act. It's 3 years since I was on stage. The ball! What a save! Fucking awesome! Let's go. No time left. Patrick, come on! Let's go, guys. Guys, let's get moving. - How much? - Already paid. Thanks. Goodbye. Just chocolates. You can try one. You like fondling toys? I'm working. - You're not on stage. - I just said you're into soft toys, like. - What the hell? - Calm down. - A full search! - Murderer! You calmed him, Russky! Poor little soft toy. You fucked it up. What have I done with my spray? I can't find my pulverizer! Pooh! I'd do as well myself. What does he do? You hear me? - Yes, sir. - Well? He does nothing, sir. Was I sleeping, while the others suffered? Am I sleeping now? Tomorrow, when I wake, what shall I say of today? That with Estragon, my friend, until the fall of night, I waited for Godot? No need to stay here. They won't fly away. - You don't know them. - I do. They're actors here. Want their records? Drug trafficking, homicide, armed robbery... Not interested. Good job we do the dirty work while you shine. My men got attacked again. So take it easy. BE BAC SOON Miss, don't stop just yet. Thank you. Come with me, please. Look at that body! - Shit, she's so hot. - Alex... Alex, let's split. - Are you nuts? - Let's split. - Who does the play? - No one. Forget it. - And the audience. - What do they care? They have an easy life. Etienne? C'mon, he doesn't sleep in a cell. You can't do that to Etienne. We're performing tonight, ok. Etienne would say it too! "Make the most of it!" Fucking idiot. - Kamel! - What? Jordan wants to split! Now we'll see. We'll see who splits. You fucking snitch. - He wants to split. - Shithead. What's the idea? It's the last show. Don't you want to be free? Think it over. We have to split. - You won't act? - I said... - Stop stuttering! - I'm not. Let's split! That shut you up. No, I'm not going back. Get off me! Act tonight or I'll waste you. Shit, I'm not going back there! Shut up. Give me the trimmer. No, let go! What the fuck is this? Raise your hand, motherfucker. Fucking ball-buster! Fucking snitch! Cut it out! Fucking let go of me! Beautiful, huh? Bastards. Kamel, you're busting my balls. I leave a lock? Let go! - Nice parting! - Fuck you all! Come here! No, you're right, get lost. Where're you going? Jordan! You're crazy! You're on in 20 minutes... Jordan took us there. Go and get ready! What's that? What is this? Are you totally dumb? - Chill, bro. - What? No way! It could've been a lot worse! You're on in 20 minutes! I don't fucking believe this. Where's Alex? Ok, guys? Irresponsible! Let us not waste our time in idle discourse! Let us act while we can. We aren't needed every day. Not personally needed anyhow. Others could do as well, if not better. The call we just heard is addressed to the whole of mankind. But right now, in this place, mankind is us, whether we like it or not. My son! Take a bow with us? You're the best! Take a bow with us. Cut it out. What's that bottle? The last show party. I'll report you, smart ass! The last show party? No way. Give me the bottle. You won't get this one! Puccino, with us! Even stars get searched! - What was that? - The search. No search tonight! Fortineau, you'll go first. No way! Search us now, ok! Wanna see my body? Check my pockets! Come and search me! What's the problem? Search my ball sack! It's Stéphane. Can't you ever pick up? The Odéon in Paris called. The Odéon! Call me, ok. Get in touch! All your actors are in the disciplinary block. They'll be out in a month. They'll never get permits again. They stripped, they didn't kill anyone. Some did... It's the Odéon... The Odéon National Theatre! I realize that, but there's no more I can do. Talk to the judge. She'll never sign an exit permit. Can't you understand that? I'll talk to her. She won't see you. Refuse the Odéon? Such a huge break? A break for you above all. What are you implying? They've no idea what the Odéon is. When they see it, they'll be stunned! The answer's no. How else can I put it? Give them these. There's one for you too. You must have been a shit lawyer. Look at me. Don't ever count on me again. Are you ok? I'm rehearsing. I understand. After being treated like stars, they return to their cells. It's not easy for them. So it's best to stop. It's a pity you never saw them on stage.... Madam Warden... You plead well, but there are things I cannot let by. I'll vouch for them. I'll go with them to Paris myself. I've followed this far, but we've done enough. I'm thinking of their victims. Quite frankly, aren't there more urgent matters? Have you ever thought about running a cultural center? I'm trying to. I can't hear anything. Me neither. - You scared me! - I thought it was him. - Who? - Godot! - The wind in the reeds. - Like shouts. - Why would he shout? - At his horse. There's nothing more. Just the words of the play. Just the words. Just the words and people's looks. I wear a bum's outfit, but I feel good in it. Frankly, I feel like I'm flying. I'm like an angel. I feel really light, despite weighing 110 kilos. Seeing all these people who basically feel afraid of me or have ideas about me... Seeing them applaud us... For once, I'm not screwing up. Usually, the slightest step I take, I trigger a landmine. There you go. That's Godot. He repeats stuff and we have to repeat what he repeats. And that... The energy's so good. We're not used to it. I'm really proud. It was a real high point. My kid was there... We're all proud. You're proud too? Of course. You're right to be. 1 YEAR Are you ready? Here we go! Right... Absurd. Look at this. Awesome! It's totally wild. - It's the Champions League. - The final. Is all that real gold? Gold leaf, more like. - The chandeliers... - Shit. Act like in Croix-Rousse or Annecy. It's easy. Make the most of this as it's the last one, ok. Free yourselves. Surprise us. It's yours. No one can take it, even at the search. Isn't the judge coming? No idea. Forget her. What matters is... Excuse me, we leave for Fleury prison at 11pm. They're stressed! Come back at the end. Get out! C'mon, you're the one stressing us. Ok, warriors. Let's go! Etienne, the judge is here. Where is she? In the stalls, just beneath me. Ok, I see her. I'll let them know. Shit, as they say. Actors on stage, please. Moussa? 10 minutes to curtain up. Kamel! Alex! - Seen the actors? - Try the stage. - I was just there. - The other stairs... - Seen my actors? - Tried the wings? Ok, thanks. Olivier, can you do another call? Actors on stage, please. 10 minutes to curtain up. I don't believe it. Boiko! Where are the others? Checked the blue room? Actors on stage, please. - Everything ok? - Fine. See you later. 5 minutes to curtain up. - Have you seen the actors? - They went that way. Thank you. This is so beautiful. They'd follow your father anywhere. He must be freaking out too. It was hell at home when he acted. Look! The Justice Minister. Next train in 1 minute, the following one in 5 minutes. No reply. I'll check. Good evening. Excuse me. I'm the show's director. Something unusual has happened. I've lost my actors. They were in their dressing rooms, but now they've vanished. I know. I can't believe it either. It's not a joke. I don't see what I can do apart from wait for them. But they won't be back, so I won't suggest that. It would be like waiting for Godot. Some know the play. It's better to laugh, but it's a nightmare. I just feel like vanishing. Sorry. Wait a second before you go. Thank you. Maybe you don't realize, but this is totally crazy. It's pure Beckett. It's as if he wrote this, understand? Know what he said about writing for the stage? It is a "wonderful, liberating diversion". I think we're seeing that. Right, Samuel? So tell me. What happens now? Nothing. Nothing's happening. It really is a Beckett play. What a beautiful theatre. I dreamed of performing here. I'm an actor by trade. An actor in Lyon. Down in Lyon, the Odéon's just a dream. But anything can happen. Too bad I'm here to send you home. You know, from the beginning, nothing went as planned. Dim the house lights. Ever been in a prison? As a visitor, I mean. You line up. You hand over your ID. Someone behind smoked glass opens the door to reception. You get a pass. You leave your phone and pass a security gate. Like at an airport. It's a real journey. Checks, more gates... There's a long walkway and you hear the prisoners. "Son of a bitch!" "Asshole!" "Motherfucker!" "Fuck your granny!" At the end of a corridor, the cells. Three guys were waiting. None of us really knew why we were there. And I thought of Godot. I thought they'd understand. They know waiting. It's all they do. Waiting for meals, exercise, mail, visits, night, sleep... And, above all, to get out. Tonight, they'd had enough. They didn't get Beckett right away. Except for one. Moussa. He got it from the word go. He'd walked from Ouagadougou. He'd done Morocco, Gibraltar and Spain on foot. When he said, "Maybe we'll sleep well fed tonight," he truly meant it. Kamel, the boss... He wanted to impress his son. Jordan could barely read, but he was funny. Patrick... Always performing for his wife. Alex, the child, two meters, 100 kilos. A go-fast driver, without a license. Innocence itself. You'd have loved them. They slowly got into it. They tackled this peak, Godot. And it was a tough climb. It was totally different. Something actors have lost. They speak from a place, I don't know where. They're elsewhere. Especially tonight. They don't have our hang-ups. Beckett isn't sacred. They wanted to see Godot. At the première, he appeared on stage. At the end, like a vision, a ghost. He looked like a killer. He came from Siberia. Boiko, my assistant. It wasn't planned, but I kept it. I had to, for them. I think Beckett would have too. Right, Samuel? I put my cowboys and Indians on a chair. Estragon, Vladimir, Pozzo, Lucky... This big. We rehearsed in the visiting room. The look on the warder's face! Six guys playing with toy soldiers. She'd never seen the like. I nearly got fired. I pissed everyone off. Prisoners, warders, the judge... And the warden. Sorry, Madam Warden. You made it all possible. True, I am a pain. It's true but, Madam Warden, to set up something like this, you have to be a first-class pain. Thank you. But at this place, at this moment, all mankind is us, like it or not. Let's make the most of it while we can. Let us represent the foul brood to which fate consigned us! But that is not the question. What are we doing here, that is the question. And we happen to know the answer. In this immense confusion, one thing alone is clear. We are waiting for Godot to come. Soon, all will vanish and we'll be alone again, in the midst of nothingness. Safe travels, guys. I'll miss you. Thank you. Goodbye. Good evening. - Are you the director? - Yes. - May I go to the dressing room? - Lead the way. You were amazing. I couldn't do anything. Go back out there. Go on. They're waiting. - Hello? - It's Kamel. We're really sorry, but we couldn't take anymore. I wanted to thank you, man, for everything you did. We won't forget. - You're not in the shit? - Don't worry. Listen. What's that? That's for you? No, for you. On April 28 1986, prisoners escaped before the final performance of Waiting for Godot in Gothenburg. Jan Jönson, the director, went on stage to explain and related this theatrical adventure. He turned the story into a show that he performs all over Europe. On hearing about the escape, Samuel Beckett said, "This is the most beautiful thing that could happen to my play."
