When I first got here, When I came as a bride... Oh, I was 21. It was February. I was 21 'n' Yoshio was 18. People made fun of me 'cause he was just a kid. Could hardly take a pee without me. Way back when, they'd tie your hair at home. "Oh, you're going to be a bride!" they'd say! That's the way it was. Sure was. ...sixty years... ...twenty-one, you know... Cutting grass in the morning. Grass for horses. Never a break. Memories of Agano Is this where we shot? No. Over there? Below here? No, no. A bit further. A little that way? This was the best rice paddy. Ah, it's over there. Ah, over there. Here it is. Ah, this is where we took the first shot. Yoshio was harvesting over there. Look how big that tree is now. This rain is awful. It must be tough for you folks, too. It's ridiculous. It's miserable... harsh! It's certainly no trip to the hot springs. How're you doing? I, ah... Sorry to... You were napping. It's so nice to see you. It's been, what, ten years since we were neighbors? Ba-chan, I brought you some manju. This rain is awful. Isn't it though? Okay, I'll sit over here. Thanks for the sweets. You folks... You came here... You came to my home before noon. Yeah, we came in the morning. Yeah, ya ya ya ya. The lady next door said you ended up at her place, chatting, even in this rain. Yeah, that's right. Ah, if if were only sunny. (This seems to be a song about an old man, awful singing and selling a cute horse) That old man's grandpa... He drank away his money. Drank and got cheated. Everything. Nothing left. Not a single rice bowl. My dad cooked at a workers' dorm. Cooked for the workers. They say, "Once a merchant..." He was hopeless. He'd say, "I'm no farmer." Those Meiji men were like that. I don't know. My folks died in April and June. Mom always said, "I'm going first." When she was sick she'd say, "Send me first, "and then later you can come." That's what she'd say. In the end, it was backwards. Mom in June and Dad in April. I still can't sit there. It's as if he's still saying, "I've got to sit there." So I can't sit there. You took my place. Get out of here. Or you can go back to bed. I have to tend the fire. I have to look, you know. Yes, but Hatano is a very busy person. Hatano isn't too busy to drink? ...hydroelectric power plant... Everybody'd cross that bridge... (Something about carrying cement... a power plant...) Koreans came... ...Koreans... Take your medicine! ...power plant... - You took a trip? - Everyone did. Endo, too? Endo? I saw some photo of you guys with a statue of the Kokuzo Goddess. That's right, we took three cars. I went in Watanabe's car. It's here, it's here. Endo usually doesn't take overnight trips, but she went anyway. She was in the photo. She was getting a hug. Once upon a time, in a place far, far away... A father... ...two brothers... ...one was a little "slow"... Dad wasn't lookin' good... ...died... ...what to do? ...problem... temple... Went to the temple, and said, "My Dad died..." ...black kimono... And then... "Priest... my dad died..." ...retarded... ...found a crow... ...Dad died... priest came. (That must be the crow) Priest, priest, please come. Our Dad's died. But... Boy, that kid's stupid... crow. Yeah, I heard that one from some old guy. ...school... ...parents... happy... ...was gre... it was! My wife, you know... - My wife, you know... "The Old Man, ...a fellow like Kumakura... "The Old Man, ...a fellow like Kumakura... he died the other day." ...from the film crew... he died the other day." ...from the film crew... "What about that... Down at the Carpenter's... "What about that... Down at the Carpenter's... ...old woman?" ...they've got that big old... ...old woman?" ...they've got that big old... "Oh, she died." ...grandfather's clock... "Oh, she died." ...grandfather's clock... "Everybody's gone..." ...When that clock rang... "Everybody's gone..." ...When that clock rang... "They're off... ...I'd tell him... "They're off... ...I'd tell him... ...on vacation... ...that clock sounds like... ...on vacation... ...that clock sounds like... ...and won't come back." ...it's sayin'... ...and won't come back." ...it's sayin'... "Yup, everyone, ..."Poor-Poor"... "Yup, everyone, That carpenter, ...they're off on a trip... That carpenter, and they won't ...he'd laugh and laugh... and they won't ...and then tell me... ...come home." ...and then tell me... "Isn’t that the truth?" ..."Ah, cut it out... "Isn't that the truth?" ...and then tell me... "Isn't that the truth?" It was pretty funny. A little slower than before. Just a short pan. Pan a shortly, stop, and hold it there. Point the light here. A bit higher. - Here? - Right there. How's this? That's good right there. Hai! Okay, okay. How old are you now? I bet you forgot. I'm already 90. Already? You've lived long! When we shot "Aga" you were, what, 80? Yoshio was 78 or 9? Yeah, it was 10 years back. I worked hard, and we mad charcoal. Chopped all those trees. Made that charcoal. I worked so hard. Come stay with me. I've got miso, rice, pickles... You can stay with me. My door's open. '90 Winter Our Deadline Yup, only men 'n' women in this world... Yup, 'n' you gotta treat women right Women keep y' goin'. Sleep with a woman... ...'n' "skaaa" it gets you goin' ...don't use it... ...it'll stop movin'... No matter how young you are, if you aren't getting any, your eyes glaze over... yup. ...women 'n' men... ...better be nice... hai! ...make it fun. White birch Blue sky South wind Magnolias in bloom That hillock Of the North Country Ah, spring in the North Country In the cities They don't know What season They're in From my mother Arrives A small bundle Shall I go home? Shall I return? I like drawing it out. The last part. Everyone goes in that thing? When they talk... Right in here. When you talk, you go in there? No thanks. No, no. No thanks. Log? Throw that log on the fire. ...'cause the fire's out. Just stoke it, Kimi. Eh? You're going to shoot me? No, no, we're shooting the fire. I... No thanks. I don't want to be in it. You're playing with me, right? Stoke it. Stoke the fire. That looks great. Ah, you got me. Hold it like this? Instead, get the fire in the stove. Get it going good. Maybe stick it here. Which way should I go? I escaped. I escaped like a galloping horse. It's good, no? The fire coming out. Ah! You shot me didn't you? Look... completely deformed my finger. From the mercury. Aw, it was just rheumatism. Completely deformed. It hurt! The doctor cracked it... Kyuu!! Oh, it hurt. But it healed. And fast. (Something about peaches... flowers... ...and inconvenience) Even at Yasuda-machi There are famous places First, blowing wind Second, two pines Three, Sando Chestnut Four, morning smoke from Orechi On that plane in the sky That's the one I'll put you on Fly over Genkainada Sea Fly over the turbulent waves We're falling, the two of us We are holding each other Over the rough waves We're in love! Don Don! Okay. Clapboard please.
