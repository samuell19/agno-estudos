Fa Lung Yih! You traitor! Kishudo, I'll definitely be back for revenge! Now, there's only a few of you left with me. Sooner or later, Fa Lung Yih will expose your identities to Kishudo. Over the years, I've trained more than 30 expert assassins in Chinese kung fu and Japanese Ninjitsu, disregarding those who've died and those in league with Kishudo. The rest are scattered throughout the world. I have to find out their whereabouts before Kishudo does, otherwise it will be a disastrous calamity. So you want to destroy them all? Those I've trained may only die by my hand. We have a contact for all our 800 Dragons assassins. His name is Cheuk Kau. He was sent to the Heilongjiang and Manzhou regions. But I haven't heard from him in decades. He knows a lot of detail about all your backgrounds and capabilities. Then where did this Cheuk Kau go, then? There is a woman we must find if we are to find him. He had a daughter by this woman too. So he left because he broke our rules. - Let us go! - Don't... No! Assassins from 800 Dragons have neither loved ones nor relatives. There is only our organisation. I have to believe that each one of you treats 800 Dragons as your family. I, Juk Seung Chyun... I, Fu Fung Ling... I, Wong Dak Yuhn... I, Fu Gong Gwan... Swear by our lives to be loyal to 800 Dragons. Master Lui Chat Lung is our leader. May we be decapitated if we betray our master and ancestors. Let me go! Ji Yim Ju! How many times have I said a child shouldn't eavesdrop on adults' meetings? I'm going to be an assassin sooner or later. You dare talk back? - Yes. - Yes. Master... You don't have to be afraid. I was very good at the skill of camouflage. A skilled person dares much. After one camouflage, another disguise, another camouflage, another disguise. Now I can't get my face back to the way it was. Fu Fung Ling. Yes, master. Camouflage is your favourite skill. Be careful. Hey, sis, don't worry. You've a long way to go. You're chattering on! I swear to destroy Fa Lung Yih! Fa Lung Yih, you traitor. You're going to die. Sir, we're closing. Don't be afraid. This has got nothing to do with you. Go now. - Yes! - Yes! Mui, it's been a while. I want to ask you where Cheuk Kau is. - We've not been in touch in a long time. - The letter in your hand... Get your photo taken with him! Only ten roubles a photo! Get your photo taken! You want a photo? Of course. Somebody wants a photo. Here? Ready? We made a lot of money in a short time. It's enough to pay our school fees. It's because I told you all to come with Uncle Dung. - Roubles? Change for roubles? - No, we can't. Are you crazy? You're refusing US dollars? - Is it really okay? - No worries. Hey, what in the world? You're changing money on the black market? Hey, a cop's coming. Let's go! - Hurry up, Uncle Dung! - Hurry up! Hurry up! Get on the tram first. You go ahead. Don't mind me. Hey! Hurry up! - You get on first! I'll help him up. - I'm getting more clumsy with age. - Go! - Be careful, then! Hurry up! Yiu Lung, quick! - Come on! - Hurry up! Cheuk Gwan, why is Yiu Lung taking so long? The snow's heavy outside. Do you think the road has been closed? It won't be. Why don't you hold this? Why don't I make him appear as if by magic? Yiu Lung! - Yiu Lung! - It's you? - Let me give you a hug first! - Stop, stop, stop... I'm called Cheuk Kau and you can't chase girls in my home. Daughter... Bring out the nice coat that Dad wore in his youth for him to wear? - Yes. - Hey, hey, let me. It's my present from Yiu Lung? Yiu Lung! Keep it to yourself, okay? Wear the coat first. I know what to do, okay? It smells so good. You look almost as good as I looked in my youth. Well, 70% as good. This outfit helped me get your mother then! Let's go eat the turkey. Before we all eat, let's all make a wish. Let's all close our eyes, close our eyes. - Okay. - You can't open your eyes. I hope... - we'll always be together. - We'll always be together. I'm going to cut the turkey in half. I'll give you the coat. Consider it a Christmas present. Thank you, Uncle. Hey, are you angry that I don't have a Christmas present for you? It's enough that you give your heart to me. - You're really not angry? Really? - Hey! What are you doing? What about me, then? What has it got to do with you? Really! You're awful! - Bye-bye! - Bye-bye! Hello? Cheuk Kau, we haven't met in decades. Do you recognise the voice? Lui Chat Lung? Don't think that just because you were hiding in Russia that I wouldn't be able to find you. Hello? Hello? Hello? Lui Chat Lung! - I'm not Lui Chat Lung. - What? - Who are you? - I'm one of Kishudo's assassins, Heidao. Heidao. - I want the registry of the 800 Dragons. - What registry? Do you still remember this? You... how did you get a hold of it? She's already dead. What? You had better cooperate, or else you'll die too. How can I leave like this? Tell me quickly! Where is the registry? You're still playing games with me? No, no... it's just a little further away. Take me to it! Quickly get up! Let's go! If we can't find it today, then you're going to die. You've been trained by Lui Chat Lung? Your level of kung fu is nothing compared to mine! Hey, where's the cello? - Mei, look at this. - Have you seen...? Yiu Lung gave it to me. Now we don't have to borrow one again. Yiu Lung gave it to you? Come out! The old one has really got something... What drugs are you on, idiot? Cheuk Kau. Mr Lui Chat Lung. Please spare my family. If you have to kill someone, kill me. Lead the Kishudo assassin onto the train. Yes. I understand. There's one more person that I need you to bring with you. Huh? Who? Your daughter's friend Yiu Lung. You've been quiet today. Was someone nasty to you? If so, let me know. My father and I have to go to Japan. We may not come back. Going to Japan? You'd like it there. You can do a lot of shopping there. - That's it? - What else are you expecting? You really have to go to Japan? Why do you have to leave? Because the police are seriously looking into my father. That means the three of us can't be together. Can you do me a favour? We're going to act like we're going to take a train to Leningrad. Can you and Yiu Lung get on the train with us and act as our cover? When the train is halfway there, we're going to jump off. Yiu Lung and I will both help you. I'm going to miss you. I told you we should have left together. Perhaps they didn't evade the police? We have their luggage. I don't think they'll be under suspicion. Let's go inside first. Come on! - Let's go get the tickets first. - Okay. Hug me quick. What's wrong? I've seen that man on the subway. Who is he? I saw him kill someone there. Wait here, and don't go anywhere. I'm going to look for them on the platform. - Where did Yiu Lung go? - Yiu Lung? I don't know. You're both acting like it's a game of hide-and-seek. Get on the train. - We can't. - We can't. If we can't find him, I'm going to be in more trouble than you two. Hurry up and board the train! Board the train! Okay. Master Cheuk! I want to look for Yiu Lung. I'm afraid he might be waiting for us downstairs. I'll go with you. - Yiu Lung, hurry up! Hurry up! - Coming! Hurry up! Hurry UP! This ticket is yours. This ticket is yours. This ticket is yours. Why am I and Yiu Lung sitting so far apart? He and I are in the first and the last cars. You and Ah Gwan are in the middle cars. If all four of us sit together, it might raise suspicions. After Ah Gwan and I get off the train, then you two can sit together. Are you the Manchurian? Yes. Heidao, you can't escape. When I was training you, I had told you that the assassins that I train may only die by my hand. I only ask that my corpse remain in one piece. This is for you. Did you make this overnight for me? I said I would make you a new padded jacket for you to travel in. Did you know that I stole your material? I threw it away in the bin. Why did you still have to retrieve it and make clothing for me? Why are you so good to me? You and Yiu Lung are my closest family. Actually the reason why I asked you to come is... because... someone wants to capture Yiu Lung! I have to talk to my father. This is the registry of the assassins. You asked that I lead the young man Yiu Lung on the train. He's on the train. He's now sitting in the first car. He and Yip Mou Mei are both orphans. I've been caring for them since they were young. You're efficient and leave no trail. You've stated matters in a very clear manner. This is nothing. Last time I violated the rules, yet you let me go, so even if I had to walk through fire, I wouldn't hesitate. I was wondering why you wanted Yiu Lung on the train. I've seen him on the Red Square. He has a very special hidden talent. I want to train him to become the best assassin in 800 Dragons. But I don't want another person to know about this secret. Father, there's something I want to discuss with you. Yiu Lung isn't in love with me. He likes Yip Mou Mei. But I... am secretly in love with him. I... Father? Father? Father?! Father! Father! Ah Gwan? Gwan? What's wrong with you? Gwan! Yiu Lung! Yiu Lung! Uncle, why did you ask me to come here? Uncle, what's wrong? I came to take you away. Who are you? Why are you taking me away? Come on, come on. Go to sleep. You can't get away from me. Yiu Lung! Yiu Lung! Yiu Lung! Please, Yiu Lung! - Do you know the deceased? - No, I don't. - Can you recognise them? - No. Isn't your name Yip Mou Mei? Yip Mou Mei. Do you know a person called Yiu Lung? No. Well, we've been informed that... your friends were being pursued. And that you were trying to help them... to flee the USSR. Isn't this true? No, it isn't true. No! No! Hey! Who the hell are you? Why stick needles in my head? I'm your saviour, brother. You're sick. What, like a cold or flu? I've never been sick in my whole life. You remember it all so clearly? Then do you know who you are? Hey! I'm... I really can't remember who I am. Do you know who I am? Of course I know. You're sick and it's caused your brain to forget the past. See, I leeched a whole bowl of coagulated blood out of you. - You leeched out so much blood?! - You've got amnesia. I think that you're actually a demon. First you pierce my chest, then my head. Tell me who the hell you are! I've talked enough to you. Hey, you had better tell me who I am. You're a Vietnamese refugee. You don't have ID. I'm a Vietnamese refugee and I don't have ID. I don't believe you! Who in the world am I? You'd better tell me. Go to sleep, bro. You've woken up, brother. Yeah. Wow, that's a lot of sweet sesame soup. It's ink, idiot. - Who is it that's working this hard? - See, that's your other saviour. - Hey, help me grind it. - Okay. - It's so fatty. Perfect for a barbecue. - You can't grill it! You don't have to be so stingy. Ji Yim Ju, why aren't you making ink? Coming. You still haven't told me who I am. Your mother is an army prostitute. Your father is an unknown Viet Cong soldier. You have six brothers and sisters too. Wait! My mother is an army prostitute? My father is a Viet Cong soldier that no-one knows? I have six brothers and sisters? My mother is an army prostitute... but that means my father was a whore's customer? That means I'm a bastard! That's impossible! Hey! Hey what? Observe carefully. From tomorrow, you're practising with me. Why should I listen to you? You're not my dad. Look at your ugly face. Your ears are pointy, your nose is hooked. Your hairstyle is like a Manchu soldier's. You're dressed like a Japanese man. If you're not a mongrel, you're a demon. I can't be bothered to speak with you. I'm going back to Vietnam. Okay. If you're capable of leaving, leave. I'm leaving, then! Be careful, brother! These aren't humans. I'm getting out of here! Why did you put a lock on my leg? Because the other half is locked to my leg. If you have to lock me up, put me with the young girl. Count me out. The chain is so big, it'll be like being imprisoned. There's no difference! Have you ever seen such a big prison? Who cares? I'm going to go back to Vietnam. Vietnam isn't that way. I'm going! My mother is an army prostitute. My father's a whore's client. I have six brothers and sisters. I am a bastard. My mother is an army prostitute. My father is a whoring customer. I have six brothers and sisters. I am a bastard. My mother is an army prostitute. My father is a whore's client. I have six brothers and sisters. I'm going back to Vietnam! I want to get back to Vietnam. Be careful. There are a lot of traps. I have six brothers and sisters. My father is a bastard. My mother is a whore's client. I want to go back to Vietnam. My father is a bastard. My mother is a whore's client. I have six brothers and sisters. I want to go back to Vietnam. - My mother is a whore's client. - Be careful, brother. My father is an army prostitute. I have six brothers and sisters... Why is there electricity here? Why is there electricity there? It's an electric fence. How far does it go? It's the size of the forest. Did any other idiot get electrocuted in the past? No, only you. Why am I running backwards? It's the old man. He's pulling you back. Be careful, there are a lot of traps. Then I'm going to die? Try to be more careful! What are you looking for? My lungs! I've run so hard, they've fallen off! Your lungs are connected to each other. - What do you mean? - It means you've lost your marbles! Damn you, old man. When are you letting me go? You have feet. You can leave on your own. Brother, be patient for a while. Little Gwai, don't leave! You want to play hide-and-seek? Fine, I'll come and get you, then. That stupid girl is playing with the bird the whole night. I told you that you won't be able to leave, Little Gwai. The damn old man is pacing in his room the whole night. A stupid girl, a damned old man. They're always doing senseless things. This can't be hell, can it? I can't be dead, can I? What are you playing at? What are you doing? Let me down quickly! Damn you, old man! Why hang me upside down? To sleep. All the blood will rush to my brain! You can die from this! You won't. It's good for health. Good for health? Hey, you're going to bed just like that? - Don't you have beds? - No. - What did I sleep on yesterday? - It's been burnt. You're a strange one. - Why touch my feet? - To see if you're ticklish. Even if I were, I can't scratch them. You're all weirdos! Why are you staring? I want to see how long you last, brother. Hey! My back is going to break! Of all the students I have trained, you drool the most in your sleep! You're crazy! So I can't drool in my sleep now?! You cook with your feet? If my feet don't work, we'll have nothing to eat. In the beginning, I couldn't eat even if I'd wanted to. No wonder you're so short, then. For your bone structure, you should be around 5' 7". But now you're 5' 3". That old man is rather vicious. If he asks us to walk on our hands one day, then we might become beasts that crawl on four limbs. If you can't interchange your hands and feet, I'll chop them off! I'm not talking to you! Eat it while it's hot! Okay. It smells really good. It's really smelly... Let's run for it, brother! - Hey, you're even eating the skin? - You only have sweet potatoes? What do you want to eat? I had a difficult time stealing them. Aren't sweet potatoes too plain a meal? - Let's have pigeon. - Hey! Just try touching my Little Gwai! I said pigeon. I didn't mention anything about your Little Gwai! You care more about Little Gwai than you care about me. Of course! Carry on, and I won't steal food for you anymore. If I eat too many sweet potatoes, I might fart a lot. It's very embarrassing. Why don't you eat one too? If one has to fart, let's fart together. You're a real embarrassment! Wasn't that you that farted? If one person has farted, he'll know himself. If two people fart, they'll know who did what. - If three people have farted... - No-one will know! The fart is mine. The sweet potatoes are mine too. Darn! It's not his fault! I stole the sweet potatoes! - What did I do wrong this time? - You stole food. Put me down! I want to fight with you! Let's talk about it tomorrow. I want to fight with you! With your level of expertise, how do you expect to fight me? You coward, let me down quick! I want to fight with you! Wow, how come you're so energetic even after hanging there the whole night? Ji Yim Ju, hurry up and get that old fool out now! Okay. Old fool, I'm going to kill you! How do you want to fight? Catch this! You want to play with this? You're going to die with this. Show me a few of your moves. Okay. Don't blink. Are you possessed or performing? If I don't reduce you to a flattened piece of shit, then I won't eat tonight. Ji Yim Ju. At least you've compassion. You're going to feed me before we fight. Is that sweet red bean or sweet walnut soup? You can eat later. Are you choosing red or white? Red, of course! Red is my lucky colour! Regardless of whether you choose red or white, you're going to be in trouble. Come on, come on! Food's here. Pay attention. Hurray! A man-made paintball! I'm a paintball, so what! You're lucky you're not eating today only, or you wouldn't eat for the rest of your life! A man keeps his word. I won't eat! But my stomach's not at its best. Hurray! A beast on four limbs! A beast on four limbs! A beast on four limbs! Little girl, what do you think you're doing? I'm taking a bath, and I'm naked. Why are you still so close? Why are you still looking? Why are you still looking? I'm still made from flesh and blood! Don't think that I won't react! What is there to be afraid of? I often bathe with the old man. The old man's weird! He might have a man's face and a woman's body? - Eat some. The old man won't know. - No! If I say I won't eat, I won't eat. You've got guts. You want to know who you are? If you want out of this forest, then you must learn from me. Okay, I'll learn from you. I saw it all! - Why did you drag me in so quickly? - If we're late, we won't eat. - What's the old fool doing? - Roasting walnuts. He's using his hands to toss them? Here's one! It's really hot! I can't believe he's tossing the walnuts with his hands. It must be a trick with the hands or the wok. Why don't you have a go? Try! Fine, I'll have a go! Do your best to toss them! I told you not to! But you had to give it a go, didn't you? Are there special contraptions attached to his hands? Of course not. If so, I'd have worked it out myself. Hey, don't lie to me. Are we having these walnuts for dinner tonight? If you don't roast them well, we won't have anything to eat. Huh? Hey, wait! I can't believe that I can't do it! Do I look that stupid? I want you to be blindfolded, so that regardless of circumstances or light source, you'll always be at your best when facing the enemy. The heart is emptied of emotion and is tranquil. With a still heart, without shadow or trickery, we face the enemy. The heart is emptied of emotion and is tranquil. With a still heart, without shadow or trickery, we face the enemy. Your heart isn't calm, how do you expect to win? I have to defeat you. I must defeat you! Courage is gushing out Heated blood is boiling over I swear to break out of the darkness To fight against tyranny I shall do my best To uphold and maintain justice Full of vigour I swear to race to make my dreams come true A free man To be a free man A free man To be a free man To be a free man! It hurts, thus it proves I'm still human! What are you doing here? Good timing. Roast pigeon, it's really good. I had planned on sharing half of it with you. You've done it this time! Catching Little Gwai to eat him! Why would I roast your Little Gwai to eat? If I did that, don't you think I would be afraid that lightning would strike me down? What a coincidence! Hey, Ji Yim Ju! Little Gwai! Ji Yim Ju, I didn't roast your Little Gwai! Don't! There's an electric fence! Little Gwai! Be careful! There's an electric fence! Little Gwai! Ji Yim Ju, why are you crying? Is Little Gwai dead? Ji Yim Ju, guess what I have here. It's Little Gwai. It's not Little Gwai. Little Gwai isn't dark like an Indian. He was white, but you're grey! Go back down, don't mind me. I told you that pigeons are like humans, they aren't senseless. So Little Gwai flew back to you, huh? Hello, Little Gwai. - Help me hold this. - Okay. - You're releasing Little Gwai? - It's not Little Gwai. Little Gwai is here. Actually, animals and humans are alike because they all want freedom. Where are you going? I'm going where Little Gwai and I will both be in the future. Once I find the means, I'll release you. Lui Chat Lung has trained someone to deal specially with me and Kishudo. Have you heard about this? He and I have lost touch. I don't know anything. If there really is such a person under him, Lui Chat Lung will become super-strong, like a tiger with wings. We can't let this man succeed. In other words, you want to destroy him? We've taken so much money from Kishudo, that old man just won't give up. I think that whatever happens, he's going to try to destroy me. Don't forget that I also betrayed him. You think he's going to let me go free? I switched off the electric fence. Quickly change and leave! I'll take your place in the meantime. The old man won't find out. Why haven't you two gone to bed? Go! - If I leave, what will happen to you? - Don't worry about me! Go! Why are you still chatting? Go! - Ji Yim Ju! - Go! Brother, hurry up and leave! - Ji Yum Ju! - Remember! Once you figure out how to leave the forest, come back for me! I definitely will! Remember! Go! - I'll leave now! You take care! - Go! It really is you, traitor! Don't blame me, then! You know how to get help, so do I! Master! Old fool! You really do know how to get help! Ji Yim Ju! How did this happen? Ji Yim Ju, I came back especially to save you. Ji Yim Ju. Listen to me. In this world, besides Little Gwai, you have another loved one, and that's me. Your brother. You always call me "brother", right? Ji Yim Ju. Repeat after me. In this world, aside from Little Gwai... Ji Yim Ju. Ji Yim Ju! Master, are you okay? Your master is injured. You must lead Yiu Lung away. I'll contact you later. Okay. Who are you? Lui Chat Lung? Damn, who are you? As long as you come with me, you don't need to know who I am. Who are you? Where is Ji Yim Ju and Lui Chat Lung? The organisation asked me to prepare their graves. They must be dead because 800 Dragons never kill the wrong people. Ha! Your misguided organisation! Why are you so cruel to old ladies and women? An enemy's an enemy. Gender makes no difference. You still have no obedience. Through Lui Chat Lung's dedication and for the survival of 800 Dragons, you must forever obey the rules of the 800 Dragons. I just want to know who I am. After you become an assassin of 800 Dragons, the secret of your background will become your driving force for survival. From this day forth, you're now an assassin of the 800 Dragons. You'll be called Free Man. Your first job is to kill a Hong Kong Chinese called Li Fung. Yiu Lung? Outside of a hotel in Tsim Sha Tsui last night, the wealthy businessman Li Fung was attacked by a Chinese man with a sharp instrument. He died at the scene. His driver and bodyguard were also killed in the incident. The police have now transferred the case to the Organised Crime and Triad Bureau. In addition, the police are requesting witnesses to come forward. Who is it? Food Delivery. - Who are you? - Wong Dak Yuhn. Trying to run away?! Why are you staring at my upper body? Why are you staring at my lower body? Hey! Can you two stop staring at each other, and look at me, please? Who is he? He is your assistant, Wong Dak Yuhn. Normally, unless he can fight past three of my moves, I won't consent to be his assistant. Then how many moves did you exchange? So many that I can't remember! Why are you looking at me? Why are you looking at me? I'm looking at you to see if you're still as silly as you were. I'm looking at you to see if your face can still be peeled off. I've already changed, and you two are still staring into each other's eyes? I thought you were just an assistant. Sis, you're overdoing the staring part. The organisation is very pleased with your actions. Your next job will be to eliminate the head of the largest Yakuza gang in Japan. Kishudo. Take a look over here. The info is on this side. Mr Ki. How come Fa Lung Yih isn't present? Mr Ki. Who might you be? I'm Detective San Tin, sent to protect you. To protect me? Do you think that you're qualified? This is my duty. I have to try my best. These two are my subordinates. If so, then watch the door for me. Ms Fu. Sir, your cigarette. Beware of the ashes. There's an ashtray over there. Please feel free to use it. Here's an ashtray, boss. Mr Ki. Protect Gwannie! Hurry up! Let's go! - Move out of the way! - Be careful! Let me take care of this! Mr Ki! - Mr Ki! - Mr Ki! Don't! Yiu Lung! Do you know the person who was just here? Is this him? It's not him. What about this one? No. - This one? - Yes. Ms Yip, we're trying to find a person, not a mask! Officer, I don't have X-ray eyes. I can't see beneath the surface. Aside from the mask, I didn't see anything. Then who is Yiu Lung? Why did you repeatedly call out his name? Because his build is similar to an old friend of mine. - Then where is that person now? - He left. Left?! I hope you cooperate more with us! Don't think we don't know anything! You're Manchurian. You lived in Russia. One year ago, you fled to America. Why did you come to Hong Kong all of a sudden? I think your file will have clearly stated the facts, Officer. I came to Hong Kong to teach dance. As you've seen that person, he will definitely come back to kill you. I don't think he'll kill an innocent woman. Ms Yip. Do you always have such confidence in someone you've never seen? What did that woman say? Nothing. Do you know how much we invest in Hong Kong each year? If it weren't for us helping your government create another cross-harbour tunnel, I'm afraid that you would have had to walk over to the other side. Three hours ago, you were responsible for protecting Mr Ki. But your duty now... is to find the murderer! - I know. - I'm sorry. So, if we have any news, we'll contact you again. Ms Yip. I heard that you had seen the murderer. I didn't. That's for the best, then. If you saw the murderer, he'll definitely come back for you. If he sees you, he'll kill you. Anyhow, as a citizen, it's your duty to provide any leads. What I saw was a person wearing a mask. Every day, I was like a crazy woman, wearing clothing that had Yiu Lung's photo printed on it. I looked for him everywhere. Everyone thought I was out of my mind. I couldn't think of any other way of looking for him. I was arrested four or five times. Each time I was put in jail, and interrogated night and day. But I am not going to give up, because I know he wouldn't leave me behind, unless he was dead. I searched for him endlessly for a year. He's not dead. I feel that he and I are getting closer and closer together. Could the person I saw today be him? The Yiu Lung that I know would never kill someone. It's you. - It's me, Ms Yip. - Did you come here to kill me? I'm sorry, but if you hadn't seen my real face, I wouldn't have to kill you. Are you Yiu Lung? No. My name is Free Man. To have to wear a mask to assassinate people all the time, do you still feel free? I don't know. Anyhow, you're the first woman I have to kill. Can I see your face? I want to know if the person who wants to kill me is Yiu Lung or not. Okay. Look carefully, then. I'm Yip Mou Mei. Have you really never seen me before? I have. In front of the hotel. - Do you remember me? - I'll remember you forever. Then you have to die. Yiu Lung! Why do you always shoot in the back? Okay. I'll shoot in the front. I'll go and destroy the evidence. Tell me... would you really come back and take me away? I'm taking you to hospital now. - What about last time, then? - Oh, so you've met before? I told you it wasn't the first time you've seen this woman. Do you actually love me or not? I'm sure he likes you, but if you don't die, he'll be in big trouble. Can you promise me one thing? I'll do whatever you say. Don't talk. You're bleeding heavily. Close your eyes. Drive faster! - Hey! - I'm driving fast now. I hate having someone point a gun to my head. Then don't pretend to be heroic. Heroes usually have short lives. Why didn't you kill the Yip girl? He had the hots for her. The minute he saw her he couldn't stop staring at her. I got an innocent girl killed once before. I don't want there to be another victim. Then tell me... are you in love with her? I don't understand you two! Why are you always asking me if I'm in love? I don't care if you're in love with her or not! Because she's our only witness, I must kill her! Forget it. Fa Lung Yih will be going to Macau on Wednesday to pay respect to the dead. This is our only chance. Mr Fa Lung Yih. Hold my gun and wait for me outside. The dead and I both want some peace. MY gun. She couldn't catch my interest, so she became a nun! A book of prayers on tape, sir. To contribute to the repairs of the Church of Seven Virtues. Okay. As you're such a pretty nun... Put it away. Close the gates. Lie down! So you're who that old fool had trained to deal with me. Today I'm here to seek revenge for Ji Yim Ju. You were lucky enough to have a scapegoat last time. You won't be that lucky this time! We'll have to take a gamble on whose luck holds! I usually kill anyone who's seen me. Usually any man who's seen me can't bear to kill me. Next time you come to church, wear more clothing. Are you worried I might catch a cold? I'm afraid you're a whore, that's all! What the...? How are you doing? If I ask you to hold me, would you do that, San Tin? I would. I definitely would. You have me at a total advantage now. Why don't you hurry up and send me to the hospital? I don't want to die along with you while in each other's arms. Why don't you hurry up? First bow. Another bow. Third bow. A bow to the relatives. Ms Fu, there's something I want to say to you. You don't have to say anything. If you want to say anything, you can tell me. Fa Lung Yih was my husband. I shall make a decision on this matter. Mr San Tin, please. I'm sorry, this is my duty. Yes... we are Yakuza, but Mr Ki was very good to me, and although we didn't have feelings for each other, he was still my husband. If you need to investigate, go ahead. Thank you for your cooperation. Although we're bad people, I still don't want his coffin moved all over the place. If you really have to search, then search me. Because I am a bad woman. I am a bad woman. Aren't you afraid? Really? I'm not afraid. If you get involved with me, it'll mean trouble for you. What sort of trouble? You won't gain any advantage. I'm taking advantage now. Although I have wronged Fa Lung Yih, he's still my husband. For Mr Ki's sake too, you have to catch the killer. It's my duty to catch the killer. I don't want a living person, but a corpse. I'll definitely catch the killer, but... to ask me to bring a corpse back... is something I can't do. You'll definitely be able to do it. Because everything that we've just done has all been recorded. Why did you do that? I told you a long time ago, I am a bad woman. However... I am certainly not an unfeeling woman. I did what I did because I had no other options left to me. I don't have control over my destiny. Bye-bye! Bye-bye! Can you please lend me your shampoo? Okay, sure. Are you cold? Your complexion isn't looking good. Yes. It's only 10 degrees outside. - You have the cold water on. - I know. Anyway, I thought something was wrong with the taps. Thank you. You handed me your conditioner instead. Okay. - Gunshot wound? - No, it's a cyst. Do I have to kill you before I kill her? Yes. If you have to save her, then kill me first. Whatever you say, I'm enjoying this. Huh? You're showering together? I won't get in your way, then. Kill the woman next door! Yiu Lung? If anything happens to her, I'll blow out your brains! Then blow out my brains! Let's go! - Is it my turn to shower? - Shower this! Being with you now, it brings turbulence again... My feelings haven't changed It's surging ahead like before Both arms raised, looking at you At night the stars are twinkling To have a chance to be close to you again One can say that it's fate Due to my wearing this shirt, I don't know how many times I was arrested. Did they think you were a hooker? They thought I was a nuisance! I wore this day and night, looking for you everywhere. Plus, these roubles are yours. When you sold all the clothing to buy me a Christmas gift, this is what was left. You've been guarding the money and this clothing the whole time? Then you didn't remarry? - I haven't married you yet! - Then you're not my wife? Of course not! I don't understand. You're so silly. What do you think they're doing? They are burning rubbish to throw it into the sea, that's all. No way! They're sending their hopes to drift till someone picks them up. I wonder if it can float all the way to Russia. Ah, I remembered something. When I was a child, I used to send paper boats out to my mother too. You're lying! You're an orphan. We grew up together in Russia parentless. We don't even know what our parents look like. I forgot you already know all about my background. I'm giving you a wish as a gift. Did you use the Green Spot carton to make it? Yes. I think if one adds some money to it, it should reach Russia. I think you'd know better than I. - Wow! It's cool! - It's so beautiful! - I'm talking about the atmosphere. - I'm talking about the food. Wow! All this spinning in circles is making me dizzy! Lucky for us that even after so many turns, we're now back together again. It's so strange. I feel a sense of déjà vu. - You really remember?! - Remember what? Ladies and gentlemen, get ready. All together, 30... 29... 28... People say that if you make a wish on the stroke of midnight then it'll come true. - Really? - Close your eyes. - Okay. - 24... 23... 22... - I hope that we'll always be together. - I hope that we'll always be together. I hope it's possible for me to always be with you. Hey! Fine. I hope you two live peacefully through this Christmas Eve. Hey! Why did you come out here? I was just making a wish. Making a wish? Making what kind of wish? I hope that we'll always be together. Liar! You overheard what I said just now. Don't! Don't fool around! Ah Mei, if you hadn't been able to find me at all, what would you have done? Continue looking for you, until I became old. Even if my hair turned grey, I'd have continued searching. Wow! Then you'd have become very ugly. All wrinkled up. I wouldn't have recognised you. Hey, do you think that when we're old, we'll be spending Christmas together like those old men and women? - You must like me a lot. - It's you who likes me a lot. Listen. Inspector San Tin from Hong Kong. Do you recognise this person? Why are you crying? You! Drooling monster! You're going to say it's the same old me. Of course I hope you won't change. Hey! There's someone out there. I've often been an evil guy. For once, I'll be a good guy. - The car's over there. Go! - Thank you! - Yiu Lung! There's lots of guns. - Why haven't you left yet! Bye-bye. Ah Mei, I don't even know where to go. You still have time to consider whether you want to be with me or not. I'll follow you to death. Let's go! It's dangerous for you to be with me. They're trying to catch me. You still have time to reconsider. I'm not leaving. - Hong Kong police, San Tin. - Okay. This man has committed serious crimes and we have to arrest him now, okay? This is a Hong Kong police officer, Mr San Tin. This person has committed a serious crime. - I hope you'll cooperate with us. - Never seen him before! Go away, go away! Now! Ready the guns! Fire! Kill everyone in sight! Now what? Sit tight! Stop your car! Stop your car! Quickly jump over there! Ah Mei! Jump over there first! What about you? Don't worry! Jump first! Jump! Be careful! Yiu Lung! Quickly jump off! The dynamite warehouse is on fire! Jump off, quick! Where's the woman? Bring her out. Let's go! Go retrieve that woman! Yes! Why are you so cruel? I always do things without leaving a trail. Me, too. Those who have violated the law cannot escape my grasp. Then do you love me? It's not the time to discuss this. Then don't say anything. Drag her into the car! Come on! Come on! Let's go! - Where's Yiu Lung? - You'll see him soon. Master. I've brought Yip Mou Mei here. Good. So you're the woman that Yiu Lung is in love with. Gong Gwan. Master. I think that we should first get rid of her. The person that needs to be gotten rid of is you. Have you betrayed me? Don't worry. I won't kill you. I still have to wait for Yiu Lung. Why did you bring me here? You got out of here. If you want to save Yip Mou Mei, then you have to go back in. Wear this. Ms Yip, let's see if you're lucky or not. Either I'll come back or Yiu Lung comes back. WITHOUT SHADOW, KNOW HOW YOUR HEART CAN BE... USE A TRANQUIL HEART TO BE CALM... What? Why is it you? I once said that the assassins I have trained must die by my hand. This time is an exception. I'm dying by your hand. - Yiu Lung! - Ah Mei! Yiu Lung! Yiu Lung, you've finally recovered your memory? Don't mention that. I don't want to know anything. Regardless, we're free at last. Whether I recover my memories or not is unimportant. My heart is only wishing for one thing... I hope that you'll leave with me. Will you?
