(SCREAMS) (GUN FIRING) Now, in closing this trial, I want you to remember the dead. The gift of life is our most precious possession. And the greatest crime in our society is ruthlessly to destroy that gift. Gloria Benson was young, beautiful, hopeful. I fervently wish we could call her back. But it's too late. Far, far too late. She's gone. Her lovely spirit has left this earth. But her murderer remains. This man, Edward Clary, who destroyed her with six shots from a.45 revolver. Have you any idea of the fearful destructiveness of a.45 at close range? One shot would have been sufficient. But six. Six. Now a terrible doom has settled over this monster. And we who are here in the name of justice must listen to the command of the great Jehovah. "Whosoever sheddeth man's blood, by man shall his blood be shed." (CROWD MURMURING) JUDGE: Order in the court! Order in the court! - Have you reached a verdict? - We have, Your Honor. The defendant will rise. "We find the defendant guilty of murder in the first degree." Sorry, Tony, but you know I never give exclusives. Just say the accused was ably defended but you can't beat the evidence. That's all. They can't beat it when you present it. Well, that's very pretty, Tony, but it won't get you that exclusive. Besides, the real credit belongs to my assistant, Miss Miles. She really prepared the case. How about a story from you, Miss Miles? Well, you can quote me as saying, "All I did was hold his coat." It is true, isn't it, Mr. Scott, that you have the highest percentage of convictions - of any DA in the city's history? - I haven't been keeping score. Tell us, Mr. Scott, how does it feel to send a man to the chair? I don't send people to the chair, they send themselves. Just one more thing, Mr. Scott, is it true that you intend to run for governor? Now whatever gave you an idea like that? If you want facts, consult my chief investigator. He specializes in them. We're hungry. Thank you, André. That was dirty. Ray's hungry as a bear. No, he isn't. He just wants to be with you. Unfortunately for him, so do I. You say the nicest things, but never in writing. - Oh, that's my legal training. - Bachelor training, you mean. - Dry martini, Mr. Scott, very dry? - Yes, two of them. Double. - This is a big day. - No, one double and one single. This is your big day, not mine. It was a good case, but only you could have won it. It's all in selecting the jury. Twelve music lovers. My kind of music. Vic, do you really intend to run for governor? What do you think I've been doing all these years? I became a candidate when I opened my first law book. Well, you don't have to look so solemn about it. It's a solemn moment. I wish I were going along. You've wasted enough time on me. It's about time you began thinking about getting married. Yes, Mr. Cupid. Well, I beat off the newshounds. - Now, can we eat? - You're just in time for a toast. - To what? - To our next governor. Paper! Clary to die in chair tonight! Paper! Clary to die in chair tonight! Nice piece, Mr. Scott. Ought to raise a lot of funds for the club. And a lot of votes for you. You know, it's a wonder those kids didn't start running when they saw me coming. I put most of their old men in jail. But get this straight, I didn't sponsor this club for votes. I was born right there in the next block. - And that's pretty hard to forget. - Sure, I understand. But my paper's thinking of supporting you and we need to humanize you all we can. You know how it is, Mr. Scott. Well, I've been too busy to be human, and I'm not gonna start kissing babies or anybody else. BOY: Clary to die in chair tonight! What's wrong with a little kissing? A lot of people prefer it to killing. Don't you, Mr. Scott? Sometimes they go hand in hand, to the DA's Office. There must be a few kind words we can print about you, Mr. Scott. For instance, I understand that you practically brought up Ellen Miles after her father died. Even sent her through law school and gave her a job in your office. Now look, her father, Judge Miles, gave me my start, and I gave his daughter hers. They don't make you governor for that. If I run, I run on my public record and I'm proud of it. Excuse me. Scott speaking. This is Borden. I'm at General Hospital. The Clary case has come apart at the seams. What? Impossible. Well, I'll be right there, Ray. General Hospital. And use the siren. (SIREN BLARING) All right, give it to me fast. A guy by the name of Chavez, has a record in four states. Robbery detail caught up with him in an alley. He didn't stop shooting till they put three bullets into him. Did you hear this so-called confession yourself? Yes, it checked all the way. It proves that Clary couldn't possibly have done it. Well, a man with three bullets in him could be delirious, couldn't he? Sure. But Chavez sounded mighty clearheaded to me. You can talk to the doctor. - What shape is he in, Doctor? - No good. Here's his confession. He couldn't have possibly have known those details unless he'd been there. Do I have to take this as a deathbed testament, Doctor? Yes, he can't live until morning, and he knew it when he made that statement. Listen carefully, emergency. Put me through to the death house at the state prison. Fast. Long distance. Calling police emergency. I want state prison. I'm not guilty, I want you to know that. - I swear it. - Yes, yes. I know, I know. You don't believe me, do you? I didn't kill her. I loved her. State prison. WOMAN: Emergency. District Attorney Scott wants the death house. Hurry. MAN: It's through right away. Just a moment, Mr. Scott, I have the prison. (PHONE RINGING) Hello. District Attorney Scott speaking. You must stop the Clary execution. Stop it, you understand? (HEAVY DRONING) (STA TIC CRACKLING) MAN: Mr. Scott. Mr. Scott. Hello? Mr. Scott. Hello? Hello? Hello? Innocent man sent to death. Ed Clary dies in chair! Read all about it! Paper! Get your papers! Read all about it! Paper! MAN: What do you read? Innocent man sent to death. Ed Clary dies in chair! Read all about it! Here you are, Benson killer caught! - Hinkel, what's happening? - Everything. You look like you've been crying. Of course not. I always get hay fever when my boss resigns. - Resigns? He can't... - Then you tell him. He's been in there all night. Don't knock or you won't get in. Hinkel told me you were resigning. I don't believe her. You've looked at the morning papers, haven't you? You've been listening to the radio. You should have called me last night. I should have been with you. Nobody was with Ed Clary when they turned that juice on him. Vic, nobody's blaming you. Everybody knows you tried to stop it. Ed Clary doesn't know it. Oh, Vic. Don't talk like that, don't think like that. Anything you did, we all did. Ray collected the evidence. I put it together. Yes, but I killed Ed Clary. You said yourself nobody else could've gotten a conviction on that evidence. No one except me. Scott, Victor Scott, the Napoleon of the courtroom. You only did your duty. You thought he was guilty, you know you did. I thought they all were guilty. Were they? Try and answer that. Were they? Vic. Don't quit. Don't drink any more of this. (SIGHS) We'll just have to be more careful next time, all of us. Careful? I can't be careful. When I walk into a courtroom, I've gotta win. I've always had to win. What do you think got me out of that slimy little block where I was born? Sure, your father helped, but I'd have gotten out anyway, even if I had to crawl on my hands and knees. I was a fighter when I was a kid. And I never stopped fighting. I never will. I wouldn't know how! You want to know why I'm resigning? Because I know I'd fight just as hard for the next conviction as I fought for Ed Clary's. And on no better evidence. There has to be a DA. Somebody has to live with that responsibility. Well, then, let somebody. As for me, I'd rather see 100 guilty men go free than convict another innocent man. I thought you said you were a fighter. I am. But I'm not a killer. You're looking at Victor Scott, private citizen from here on out. I'm gonna set myself up a nice little civil practice. Get rich shuffling big corporation contracts from one drawer to another. I'm gonna have money in my hands, not people's lives. Oh, Vic, you don't know anything about civil law. I know all about all kinds of law. Please, Vic, you need some sleep. What I need is another bottle of Scotch. Well, good evening, Judge. How's the roast beef tonight? Hello, Scott. I'm sorry, Mr. Scott, but this table is reserved tonight. I bought and paid for this table long ago. WAITER: You know how it is, Mr. Scott. Some out-of-town people. Thank you, sir. Scotch, double. Hello, John. Hiya, Mamie. How are you, Victor? Here you are, sir. Told you to make it a double. I did, Mr. Scott. Haven't seen you around, John. You know me. I don't see any more of lawyers than I can help it. Afraid you won't be able to duck that patent suit. I understand the inventor refused the settlement. Oh, I'm not afraid of a suit. - Well, you needn't be if I handle it. - You? You're not serious, Vic. Of course I'm serious. I'm setting up a civil practice. I heard that, but I couldn't believe it. - You're a criminal lawyer. - You want to win that suit, don't you? That's why I'm going to retain Johnson & Reinhardt. I just can't take a chance, Vic. - John, we must hurry. - Yes. - MAMIE: Good night, Victor. - Good night. How's it going, Mr. Scott? Between ourselves or for publication? I don't think publication need worry you at the moment. Civil practice is no breeze, huh? These stuffed shirts act like I never read a law book, all I ever did was spellbind juries. Maybe it's just that a little bit of the magic has rubbed off the name of Scott. You mean maybe a little dirt has been rubbed on. They'll come running to me yet. I'll keep the presses oiled and waiting. And not for my obituary, either. You tell that to your editor. Good night, Mr. Scott. Now see if you know what double means. - What time did he come in? - Just before sun-up. That's regular with him now. - Can you bring some hot coffee, please? - Sure, ma'am. Vic? (SLURRING) We don't want you, Victor Scott. We're gonna retain Sloan & Pierce. - We're gonna retain... - Please, Vic. Goodbye, Mr. Scott. You stink, Mr. Scott. - Hello. - Hello, Vic. You shouldn't have come. Big mistake. There's some hot coffee coming. And then you're gonna have to get out of these wet clothes. Women are so practical. I always said women are practical. Now, Ellen, you be practical. Get out of here. Do you really want me to? When your old man died, I said I'd be a father to you. "Don't worry, " I said, "I'll take care of her." Now here you are, taking care of me. Maybe you shouldn't have tried to be a father. Maybe that wasn't the way. It was the only way. Now, you go ahead and marry Ray Borden. Father's orders. Yes, yes, there's plenty of time for that. No, maybe not plenty of time. Now you go do it. Father's orders. Now, go on. Do it. I don't want coffee. I don't want practical women. I just want to drink. Father's orders. Excuse me. - Here, that's mine. - Just want to look at it, chum. Hey, did you see this about Ed Clary's mother? - Ed Clary? - Yeah, the guy they fried by mistake. She died of a busted heart. No wonder. Says here, "The former district attorney couldn't be found for comment." That guy. Yeah, he probably can't talk for laughing. Rise and shine. Rise and shine. Greet the beautiful morning. A clean mind and a clean body. MAN: Do you solemnly swear the testimony you should give in this case should be the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? I do. You were present when the alleged crime was committed? I sure was, Your Honor. I saw him hit that man over the head with a lead pipe. JUDGE: Under what circumstances? It was a big fight, Your Honor, and everyone was in it. Thank you. You've heard the witness, Joseph Carter. You are not required to give evidence, but you may do so if you desire. I'm innocent, Your Honor, and I got something to say. Proceed. That guy was a pug, a professional prizefighter. What was I supposed to do when a guy like that swings on me? You say he attacked you? I say them jabs and right crosses, real professional stuff, was coming at me so fast I just couldn't see. But you struck the fatal blow. I'm innocent. I plead not guilty. It appearing to the court that the crime of manslaughter, a felony, has been committed, and that there is reasonable cause to believe that the defendant committed said crime, it is now ordered that the defendant be bound over to Superior Court for trial. Victor Scott. Victor Scott, you are charged with drunkenness and disorderly conduct. - How do you plead? - Guilty, Your Honor. Mr. Scott, I'm not going to pretend that I don't know you. Nor am I going to pretend that I am unmoved by the sight of a man of your caliber appearing before me under such circumstances. $50 or 10 days. Believe it or not, Your Honor, I can still pay the fine. You and your testimony. You didn't see a thing. - I did... - All right, break it up. Break it up! Listen, Adam, all I done was tell the truth. Okay, shove off. You, get over there and behave yourself. You ought to know this rough stuff won't help your case. I ain't got no case. Never say that out loud. Tell me, is it true that the deceased was a prizefighter still active in the ring? Well, he fought the semi-windup at Clancy's last week. Well, then, get yourself a lawyer. You could win the case. What'll I pay him with? Chips? No, I mean it. You know, in this state, a professional prizefighter's fists are considered deadly weapons. So is the lead pipe I smacked him with. But it was self-defense. You trying to sound like a lawyer? He is a lawyer. Him? I'm through with mouthpieces. They take the fee and I take the rap. Well, go on, take the rap. I forgot that free advice was never worth the money. Not even to fellows like him. Hey, you really think you could get him off? - Lead-pipe cinch. - Yeah? (CHUCKLING) Don't get up, Ray. I won't interrupt but a minute. I just had a thought on that Olsen case. Could you gather up everything you have on it and see me in the morning? Well, of course, but it's still quite incomplete. That's all right. I may have an idea for a shortcut. Might save Ray's boy some trouble, too. - That's the spirit I like to see, chief. - All right. How do you like our new boss by now? Oh, he's very considerate and a hard worker. But no Victor Scott, is that it? Still accusing me of hero-worship, eh? I admit I'm surprised that you didn't follow Scott instead of sticking with the new DA. Victor wouldn't have me. It's that simple. Oh, André, can I have a little more coffee, please? Well, maybe it's just as well. You don't sound very sympathetic. Oh, I am. It's just that when you and I are together I always feel like Victor Scott's the ghost at the feast. I'd just like to lay him away long enough to persuade you to marry me. That's funny. Victor told me the same thing. - What? - To marry you. Brilliant man. How about it? Don't rush me, Ray, please. - I have to go. - What's the hurry? I have to see my lawyer. Want to come along? Scott? Mmm-hmm. It's sort of an important occasion. Maybe very important. Okay, but I can see the old ghost rising up again, bigger and clammier than ever. Now, Mr. Taylor, you testify that you saw the defendant strike the deceased over the head with a lead pipe. TAYLOR: I don't know all about that. But I saw that guy there hit the guy that was killed. There was a general free-for-all fight, wasn't there, Mr. Taylor? Sure, everybody was swinging. - Did you take any part in it yourself? - Yeah, I was in it. Did you exchange any blows with this gentleman? (STAMMERING) I don't remember. Now, isn't it a fact, Mr. Taylor, that you were knocked unconscious by this man before the fatal blow was struck and that you couldn't possibly have seen the blow that caused the death of the victim? That little guy? Knock me out? (SCOFFS) Little? He's as big as I am. You? An old man like you couldn't knock me out. I got an iron jaw. Not even if you weren't expecting the blow? Not even if I held up my chin like this and let him hit it. That's all, Mr. Taylor. Thank you very much. (CROWD EXCLAIMS) (CROWD CHATTERING) (GAVEL POUNDING) Your Honor, I move to dismiss the case in the interest of justice. Motion granted. Ellen. What are you doing here? We came to lend you moral support and you didn't even notice us. Well, you know me in the courtroom, I never see anybody but the jury. - How are you, Ray? - Fine. That was a great performance, chief. Knock-out, wasn't it? And what a fee. Fistful of nickels. I don't know what made me think I wanted to fool around with civil law. - You sound like your old self, Vic. - Oh, better. A DA is just a big wheel in a lot of machinery. This way, you're on your own, and that's the way I like it. Vic, this sounds like a good time for a double celebration. Ray and I have something to tell you. We're going to be married. Then don't forget, I give the bride away. I knew you wouldn't have it any other way, Vic. Well, I think this calls for a drink. - Especially for me. - No, thanks. One thing you two don't need right now is legal advice. Besides, I have to look for an office. No room for clients in this one. But we will see you soon, won't we, Vic? Yes, of course. Now you two run along and have a good time. So long, chief. (PHONE RINGING) Mr. Scott's office. No, this is not the Safeway Cleaners and Dryers. Some idiot wants his pants pressed. Maybe we ought to get a new number. No, not so fast. We may be pressing pants yet. You should have stuck with that job you had with the transit company. If I have to count nickels and dimes, I'd rather do it here. That's your prettiest compliment yet. Have you bought that wedding present for me? No, you can't afford anything that expensive. Why not? Business is booming. Two pickpockets, one peeping Tom and one grand theft auto. - Now, go on, buy it. - It's crazy. Look, you can't make yourself feel any better by throwing money away. You know you should have married her years ago. I was too old. You weren't too old seven years ago. You were just too busy. And too scared of losing your precious independence. Hinkel, I'm always wrong about you. I thought I'd be glad to have you back. Go on, buy that present. I will, if I can find a jeweler who gives up to 10 years to pay for... I think we have a customer. Are you coming or going? I gotta see Mr. Scott right away. - Well, he's a very busy... - But I can't wait. - In a few minutes it may be too late. - The police? - Yeah. - Well, that's different, just a minute. This looks good. He's shaking all over. You can hear his teeth rattling. Never mind the teeth, can you hear any money rattling? Loose change, anything? - There's nothing on him but baying dogs. - Send him in. - I don't believe I've had the pleasure. - You don't know me, Mr. Scott. My name's Parker. I'm cashier for the E.A. Smith Company Securities House. - E.A. Smith and Company? - Yes, sir. Sit down. What have you done? I've taken $90,000. - So you're an embezzler. - I didn't mean to steal it. I only borrowed it. I was going to put it right back. Well, what have you done with it? Played the market? Me, play the market? Certainly not. - It was the horses. - All of it? - Well, there was a woman. - Yes, naturally. And you wanted to give her nice things. With embezzlers it's always women and racetracks. Occupational disease. Where have you got it? Right here. Let's see it. - What do you want me to do? - Keep me out of jail. Don't let them take me. You can beat anything. I read all about you in the papers. - Have you told anybody about this? - No. I wanted to confess, but Mr. Smith is a hard man, he'd send me to jail for $10. The state auditors are already there. They'll discover it any minute. Well, then, there isn't any time to lose. (BUZZING) Now, look, Parker, you're taking orders from me right now. - Remember that. - Yes, sir. Lock him in the empty office and keep him quiet. - What's the phone number? - What? E.A. Smith and Company, what's the number? Oh, Winslow 42-800. - Winslow 4... - No, 84-200. 84... Still juggling figures, eh, Parker? Leave that alone. Now, you do as I tell you or I'll throw you out for the first cop to pinch. - Parker. - Parker. Impossible. (STAMMERING) I don't believe it. Why, he's one of our most trusted employees. They usually are, Mr. Smith. It's rather a pity to wait and let the auditors convince you, but since you asked for it... - I realize that your time is limited... - Now, wait. You spoke of restitution. In part. If Parker is not prosecuted. I'll not consider it. It's an outrage. It's blackmail. How much? $50,000. Why, that's absurd. I won't think of it. Parker goes to jail. Which he richly deserves, but can you afford to think only of Parker? Why not? The unpleasant publicity of an embezzlement naturally will affect public confidence in your institution. How much confidence can you afford to lose today, Mr. Smith? You... You... You... You... - What's that? - $50,000. - I won't accept it! - Yes, of course not, but you might be interested in identifying the wrappers. - $50,000. - Precisely. Better than nothing. - What's this? - An agreement not to prosecute Parker. - And if I refuse to sign it? - Parker stands trial. And you gain nothing but a black eye for your firm. (SIGHING) Now, may I know the whereabouts of my former cashier? Well, yes. Yes, indeed. Of course. Oh, all right, Hinkel, now. He's here. I almost forgot to give you the pleasure of seeing him. You thief! You cheap little crook! To think I trusted you for 10 years. Why did you do it? - Mr. Smith, I... - Don't talk to me. Well? Well, haven't you anything to say? Go on, go on, Parker, speak up. - I'm sorry, Mr. Smith. You see... - Sorry? You steal $90,000 and you're sorry. - Well, I tried to make restitution. - Restitution, a paltry 50,000. I restored 60,000. Well, naturally, there was the attorney's fee. $10,000 for your part in this criminal affair? No, for the knowledge of a lifetime. Fine pair. A thief and a blackleg lawyer. Oh, by the way, Mr. Smith, how's Mr. Garland? - Who? - Frank Garland. The name's not familiar to me. Now, Mr. Smith, even the schoolchildren know about Frank Garland. Oil wells, breweries, trucking companies, hotels, investment companies, such as yours, to say nothing of vice... Sir, are you suggesting in any way that I am... Oh, no, no. Not at all, Mr. Smith. Then it's all settled? They won't prosecute me? No. You're not gonna keep all my 10,000... Your 10,000? You stole it. I earned it. But it's all I've got. You wouldn't take everything I have, would you? I can't get work now. What can I do? You can get out of town and keep going before you lose more than money. Then it's true about Garland? E.A. Smith and Company is one of his fronts. Better get a move on, Parker. - Hinkel? - Yes, sir. Hinkel, I think we can pay cash for that wedding present now. All things change except this office. - Hello, Ray. - Hello, Mr. Scott. Sorry I'm late, Mr. Ford, but I didn't get your message until a few minutes ago. I think you know Mr. Smith. Do you need me for anything else right now, chief? No, I'll catch you later, Ray. Mr. Scott, this gentleman accuses you of having committed a felony in the sum of $10,000. On the contrary, I saved his corporation $50,000. Mr. Smith is the one who has violated the law. Me? Me? In the penal law there's a crime known as compounding a felony. - Would you like a definition? - What does he mean? Compounding a felony is roughly defined as concealing a crime. But that's what he did. An attorney is not bound to make known to the authorities a crime confessed to him by his client. In fact, he's prohibited from doing so as a privileged communication. Is that correct, Mr. Ford? That's the law. When Parker made restitution through me a part of the funds, did you agree not to prosecute? - I... Well, I... - Did you, Mr. Smith? He did. And in writing. Mr. Smith, you should have taken legal advice. There's nothing I can do for you. Nothing. I'll take this up with the Mayor. I'll take this up... Mr. Scott, I'm not going to pretend that I approve of your procedure. It was legal and in my client's interest. What more can you ask of an attorney? - I'm sorry. - Ellen. I didn't know you were still here. I was hoping I'd see you. - How are you? - Fine. We miss you, Vic. You promised to drop over. And I will, but I've had my hands full. Too full, Mr. Ford seems to think. Mr. Scott seems to forget very quickly that he once sat at this desk. Well, you're wrong. I'll never forget it. However, if you want to lock horns with me, maybe you'll wish I could. Every time you sit there and have a thought, just remember I sat there and had it before you. Bye-bye. - Mr. Scott, my name is Andrew Garth. - Yes? I believe you know the gentleman I'm associated with, Mr. Frank Garland? Yes, I've heard the name. He wondered if you could drop by and see him. Now, why would Frank Garland want to see me right out of the blue? It's not exactly out of the blue, Mr. Scott. My office hours are from 9:00 to 5:00. Tell him to phone for an appointment. Mr. Garland would like you to come to his office, Mr. Scott. Now. What if I'm too busy to go? Nobody's that busy. - You may be right. - I am, Mr. Scott. Beautifully tailored suit, Mr. Garth. I suppose you wear suspenders. I mean braces. VICTOR: Yeah, just as I thought, braces. (PIANO PLAYING) Tell the boss we're here, will you please, Miss Worth? Mr. Garland asked me to remind you to take care of the errand he mentioned this morning. Oh, of course, right away. - Well, it was nice meeting you, Mr. Scott. - Thank you. Mr. Scott to see you. Tell him to wait a moment. Friend of yours, Ray. You better use the other door. So long, Mr. Garland. You're doing great. See you. Send Mr. Scott in. Play me another chorus. You stole $10,000 of my money. Bigtime for a cheap finagler like you. Sour note. Were you really stupid enough to think that you could knife Frank Garland? Get up that $10,000 or you won't be chasing ambulances anymore. They'll be chasing you. Go right on, honey. The name is Angel O'Hara. - Listen to me, Scott. - You know, Angel... Go to Ben Rice at the Club Continental. Tell him you're hired. Leave your private telephone number with my secretary. - Thank you, Mr. Garland. - Later. Interesting girl. Lives and breathes music. Well! I always knew that you were a man of far-flung interests... Degas. Isn't that a Gauguin? I've always had to content myself with reproductions. When you were District Attorney, how much did you know about me? Oh, quite a lot. I'd have indicted you in time. No, because 90% of my interests are as genuine and respectable as those paintings. Trucking companies, investment houses, canneries, credit jewelry, 38 stores. - Very impressive. - So's the way you took my man Smith. You have legal knowledge and nerve. I can use both. No, thanks. Could be very profitable. Make that 10,000 look like peanuts. You're like me, you gotta be on top. What do you say? You don't need a criminal lawyer for your legitimate interests. You want me for your rackets. For your gambling and vice that pays the freight. - Am I to believe you have scruples? - No, no, no, none whatever. - Then there's no problem. - And no deal. Know why I could never indict you? Because nobody would talk. Why wouldn't they? Because you own them, body and soul. Well, you're not gonna own me. Nobody is. (GUN FIRES) (WOMAN SCREAMING) - 15-2, 15-4. - 15-2, 15-4. Well, your game. This is your lucky day. I understand you won that oil rights case, too. One of the junior partners did most of the work. Nothing like having bright young men around the office. You weren't so lucky in that Carol thing. Who's Carol? Fellow named Al Carol and his business partner wanted to split up. We were handling the legal details. Right in the middle of it, his partner died. Suddenly. RAY: Too suddenly. We're indicting Carol for slipping his former associate a little poison. Well, that's one way of dissolving a partnership. You going to defend him, Steve? Well, he wants us to, but it's not our line. Say, how about you handling the trial work for us? - Is he guilty? - Our clients are never guilty. Especially with a kibitzer present. Oh, don't worry about me. I've got to get home to dinner. Say, do I! Ellen will murder me if I keep that roast waiting. - How's the cooking? - Why don't you come and find out? - One of these days. That's a promise. - Good. Well? How about it? Are you going to handle the trial for us? - If the fee is big enough. - Bigger than I can say out loud. Louis, another drink for Mr. Harper. Actually, ladies and gentlemen, this is a very, very simple case. The prosecution charges that the defendant committed murder by administering poison. The prosecution has tried to show you that Mr. Carol's business partner finally became a business rival, and for that reason he was, shall we say, eliminated. Now, the law provides much simpler and less risky ways of dissolving partnerships. Murder seems a little unnecessary. A little overemphatic. But the prosecution had to find some alleged motive. Also, the prosecution is trying to introduce evidence that the defendant was engaged in illegal enterprises. Well, let me say that I myself in preparing the case made every effort to uncover anything questionable in his activities, and I can honestly tell you that I found nothing. The prosecution is merely trying to prejudice your minds. And the court justly ruled that all such evidence be stricken out. Is this the bottle containing the so-called poison which was used to commit the murder? FORD: It is. You say it contains enough poison to kill a dozen men? It does. Ladies and gentlemen, here's my answer to the accusation. (CROWD EXCLAIMING) I have concluded, ladies and gentlemen. (CROWD CHATTERING) (GAVEL POUNDING) Are you all right? Never felt better. Well, what happens now? Ford asks for a recess. Yes, Mr. Prosecutor? I want to enter a firm protest against the sensational and deplorable antics of the attorney for the defense, Mr. Victor Scott. I will take the protest under advisement. Is the prosecution ready with its summation? Your Honor, in the light of this unexpected development, the People request a recess until tomorrow morning. Recess granted. Make a note to file this in the county clerk's office. Also, make a memorandum to look up the decision of the court of appeals in the case of The People v. Stacey. Vic. There was poison in that bottle. You don't think I'd deliberately take poison? But the analyst said there was... Well, let's say the analyst's report is incomplete. What do you mean? I mean your boss needs an analyst, a new one. Now, don't worry. Father's orders. I've never seen anything like it, Mr. Scott! Never! Oh, you're the greatest man I ever saw! Madam, you're not inferring my client is guilty? Hold it, Mr. Scott. Quite a stunt, Mr. Scott. Let's say I simply had the courage of my convictions. Sure, and something up your sleeve. Tell me, do you like this better than being governor? I'm afraid you're not one of my most ardent admirers, Mr. Knight. But I am. Or at least my editor is. He's interested in good copy, and you get more interesting every day. He'd like to do a whole series of articles on your new career. Some other time. Oh, now, Mr. Scott, don't tell me you're not interested in publicity. How else can a mouthpiece advertise his wares? If I had known you were coming, I'd have saved you some poison. Then it was poison. Don't believe everything you read in the papers. You seem nervous. Got an appointment? Yes, I have, and I'm in a hurry. Excuse me. Better hurry with that pump. Thanks, Scott. The defendant was one of my valued associates. But I hardly expected you to risk your life for him. You knew? Looks like we're all on the same team now, doesn't it, Vic? (SINGING) Sorry Mrs. Harper couldn't be here this evening. Shame, isn't it? Al, good to see you back in circulation. Make yourself at home. Thanks. Just don't offer me a chair. Miss Hathaway, Mr. Garland. I believe I have run into Miss Hathaway from time to time. Try this on for size, Ginnie. Isn't it gorgeous? You have such elegant taste, Mr. Garland. - And what's this? - Remembrances for the ladies. Such simply elegant taste. Our guest of honor. (PEOPLE CLAPPING) I think Mr. Carol should rate that. Yeah, thanks to you. - How you feeling? - I'm fine. I've discovered that I have a very strong stomach. How fortunate for all of us. I have a little souvenir for you. - You know, when you drank that stuff... - Yes? I nearly got a heart attack. Well, it's a good thing the DA's analyst forgot to state that that particular poison takes 45 minutes to work. Even so, if Ford hadn't asked for a recess, you'd have needed another lawyer. This is a rather rare variety. I selected it especially for you. Thank you. I'm sorry, but I don't know one carnation from another. The study of flowers can be very rewarding. Open it. (ANGEL SINGING) Hello. I see you got the job. I see you did, too. (ANGEL SINGING) Miss Hinkel, Mr. Goldman's on the phone. Says he must see Mr. Scott today. It's a matter of life or death. Fine, tell him 3:00 tomorrow. - Miss Hinkel, excuse me... - I know, I know. Now, be patient. Mr. Scott will see you as soon as he can. I'm sorry, Mr. Goldman, it'll have to be 3:00 tomorrow. Right away. Hello. Mr. Scott's office. You could be overdoing this, you know. All work and no play makes... Now, no finger-wagging today. I'm too busy. Here. File this, just in case. He may be back, and he may not. He looked a little upset. Yeah, they always look that way when they won't level with me. How can a lawyer help anyone who won't tell him the truth? Oh, here, the horse parlor case. In the permanent file. It's closed. $300,000 a month wire service take. Who gets all that money? How should I know? All my clients are innocent. (BUZZING) - Yes, Ruth? - RUTH: Mrs. Borden's here. Have her come in. Send her in, Ruth. Hello, Hinkel. It's wonderful to see you again, Ellen. Ellen, this is a pleasant surprise. It's nice to have at least one visitor who hasn't committed a felony. Same old Hinkel. Yes, but is it the same old Victor? - How's Ray? - He's fine. Victor, I must talk to you. - Don't tell me you need an attorney. - No, no. But perhaps you will. You mean, this is an official visit? No, the District Attorney doesn't know I'm here. This is on my own. I see. Victor, what's happened to you? Has winning become that important? It's always been important to me. What are you getting at? I want to know what's become of the Victor I once knew. Well, come on, Ellen, get to the point. What is all this? Victor, you're winning your cases by any crooked methods you can use. You mean, the horse parlor case? Well, it's not my fault that your boss couldn't get an indictment. Do you expect me to believe that? As former district attorney, you have a pipeline into our office. You must have. One of our people is in your pocket, and the DA knows it. Now, look, Ellen, Ford has a whole army of people working for him, including yourself. I have to buck all that alone. I'll use any weapon that's handy. Sure, I had certain information, but it didn't come to me from your office. I'm sorry I don't believe you. I can't. Did you ever know me to lie to you, Ellen? I'm not sure I ever knew you at all. Goodbye, Victor. She arrived at Scott's office at 4:03 and was admitted at once. She left at 4:09 and went back to her office. Did she seem nervous? Mr. Ford, we don't deal in conjectures. Like the District Attorney's Office, our business is facts only. Mrs. Borden has a fine record here. But she is an intimate friend of Victor Scott's. Perhaps more intimate than we know, much as I hate to say it. I shouldn't have to emphasize to you how serious this is. When I hire a private organization to spy on my own personnel... Phillips, if this constant leakage of information isn't stopped, we might as well close up shop. Every assistant district attorney, every special investigator is being watched. We're not miracle men, Mr. Ford. That's all we can do. I think I can do more. Miss Connolly, I'd like to see all the department chiefs in my office immediately. Also Mrs. Borden. Don't bother to call Mr. Graves. He's already here. CONNOLLY: Yes, sir. Thanks, Phillips. I'll let you know if anything comes of my idea. Okay, Mr. Ford. Mr. Graves. - What happens now? - You'll see. - You want me, chief? - Yes, but we'll wait for the others. Sit down, Ellen. This will just take a minute. I wanted you all to know that we haven't given up on that horse parlor case. We're convinced Harry Devine is guilty, and we won't give up until we get him and the men behind him. I'm instructing the police department to pick up Devine again. If they want to play rough, we can, too. That's all. I still don't get it. Is this some kind of a trap, or is it on the level? It's both. We want Harry Devine, and we want to find the leak. If Devine's warned, we'll at least know that someone who was in this office just now tipped him off. Oh, by the way, George, if you're the tipster, you'd better make your move, unless you want Scott and Garland on your neck when we bring Devine in. Hello, Ray. Say, I've been missing you the last few days. When are we going to take that fishing trip? Well, I'm afraid it'll have to be next summer. We're real busy. Now, don't you kid me. It's Ellen. You'd better start asserting yourself. Maybe you're right. Listen, why don't you drop in my office and we'll talk it over sometime? Okay. Say, I've got a new rod, and is it a honey. And if you want one like it, I can get it for you for 20% off. Well, that's fine. Well, listen, you call me up, and we'll talk it over. - Okay, Ray, will do. - Fine. Oh, Ray, here you are. Weren't we going to meet at the south entrance? No, here. At least, that's what I thought you said. Oh, well, it doesn't matter. Come on. It's nice to get home after that madhouse downtown. Well, what's that for? I'm agreeing with you. It's nice to be home. What's for dinner? Just as I thought. Dinner. - I'll fix a drink. - Good, I'll be right with you. Ellen, who's been drinking my Scotch? Well, the last time I saw the bottle, it was half full. Oh, dear. The building must have a new cleaning woman. Oh, well, I'll go over to Matt's and get another fifth. I'll be right back. No, Ray, I'll go. There are some things I want at the market anyway. Okay. But don't take the weekend. I'm hungry and I'm thirsty. I know about you. (RINGING) Mr. Garland's residence. Who is this? Well, of course it makes a difference. Mr. Garland doesn't speak to just anybody. Listen, you dumb broad, tell him it's Ray Borden, and it's very important. Mr. Garland, darling, sweetie... Will you please shut up? Can't you see I'm talking long distance? FRANK: Tell him we'll pay $240,000 down. No more. Hello, I'm extremely sorry, but Mr. Garland's talking long distance and cannot be disturbed. Well, tell him to call Ray Borden back right away. (PHONE RINGING) Ray? What's so important? Order from the DA to pick up Harry Devine. (GLASS SHATTERING) Looks like I'll have to go and get another bottle. We'd better clean it up first. They'll smell it way down the hall. They'll think we're running a saloon. You must be thirstier than ever now. I won't be a minute! Who are you trying to fool? I know you heard. Just can't wait to phone the DA, can you? Remember me? I'm your husband. How can I ever forget it after this? Who are you loyal to? The DA or me? I married you because I loved you. And you're mine. Aren't you? Answer me! Aren't you? Yes. Well, let's see you act like a wife instead of a flunky for the DA. Do you think I wanted to get into this spot? Ray, how can I talk about it? How can I even think about it? I got sucked into this. Could I help it that I like to gamble and couldn't pay off on the peanuts they paid me downtown? What did you want me to do? Let myself get found in an alley some morning? I had to play it smart. I had to go along. And what harm has it done? If it hadn't been me, they'd have found somebody else. You can't stop them. Nobody can. So you might as well climb on for the ride. Your precious friend Victor Scott did it. Why do you look down your nose at me? At least Victor Scott's not on the public payroll. Ellen, look at me. Look at me and tell me I come first, ahead of everything. Have I ever said you didn't? Prove to me you can keep that pretty little mouth shut. How could I prove it? That's just it. You can't. Too bad we didn't get married years ago, before you got DA written all over you. Now it's too late. Don't come any closer, Ray. Don't come any closer! Please, Ray, don't come any closer! You may come in now, Mr. Scott. Thank you. Victor, what are you doing here? Why didn't you tell me? I'll only be a minute. She in your pay, too? She told me it was my lawyer. My lawyer's name is Fraser, not Scott. Well, it's Scott now. Fraser welcomed me with open arms. You can't represent me without my consent. Besides, I don't need Victor Scott. I'm guilty of nothing, except defending myself. Was Ed Clary guilty? They haven't even charged you. You're a lawyer. Doesn't that mean something to you? It means they're doubtful about whether to charge me at all. Hardly. They're arguing whether to make it first or second-degree murder. - No, I don't believe it. - You'd better. You may be fighting for your life. Ellen, listen to me. Ray's dead. You shot him. There was no witness. It could have been a family row. It could have been jealousy. You could have been considering it for a long time. It could be first-degree. But it wasn't. It wasn't! Yes, I know. I know Ray Borden was the pipeline. Then I suppose it was you on the other end of the phone. Now, don't make me feel any guiltier than I already do. Ellen, we were together a long time. That's as far as it went, because I think we both knew I was the wrong man for you. But now, and only for now, I'm the right one. I can get you out of this. And I may be the only one who can. You've got to believe that. Oh, Ray! I feel so alone, so undecided about everything, so helpless. Courts and trials, they all seem so frightening when you're on the other side. I should have taken better care of you, Ellen. Just trust me. Well, Mr. Scott, you've been told I'm very busy. The police say you intend to resist this writ of habeas corpus. Yes, they checked with me. It was procured irregularly. We're getting tired of your methods, Mr. Scott. It was not procured irregularly, and it's signed by Judge Wick of the superior court. Yes, yes, I know. I don't believe Judge Wick can be corrupted, even by you. Well, thank you for that concession. You knew we were here, but you made sure we had no opportunity to oppose the issuance of this writ. Well, there it is, duly signed and legally procured. You will release the prisoner or charge her. Ellen Borden will be charged today. Then I'll arrange for bail. Mr. Scott, there'll be no bail. She's being charged with first-degree murder. You'll never get an indictment. That's for the grand jury to decide. The case puzzled me for a while. But no longer. The motive is quite clear now. And now, if you'll excuse me... (DOOR CLOSES) - Get Mr. Graves on the phone. - WOMAN: Yes, sir. No, George. Scott just left my office. From now on, he is to be considered a material witness and watched around the clock. I expect a full report of all his movements. Hello, Mr. Scott. Andy. What are you doing here? - Waiting for you, Mr. Scott. - Yeah? We've heard rumors, unpleasant rumors. Let's take a little stroll. I'm in no mood for you. Beat it. Come on, Mr. Scott. Get in. - Hello, Victor. - Hello, Frank. - Thought we'd better have a chat. - About what? They're saying that you're going to defend Ellen Borden in court. That's right. That might be embarrassing. Forget it. You're not going to be involved. I'm a worrier, Victor. Sometimes these things backfire. Well, every time you go into a courtroom, it's a gamble. I'm the house, Victor. I never gamble. Don't you realize why I took this case? I know Ray Borden was your man. Now, do you want some other lawyer poking into this thing, turning up all the evidence he can find, no matter whom it hurts? I know how to keep on safe ground. I'm not just defending Ellen Borden. I'm defending you. I want you to know, Victor, that you'll be very well paid for this case, whichever way it turns out. Or knocked it aside. I'm not sure which. And that's when you pulled the trigger? I never even knew I pulled the trigger. Thank you. Your witness. FORD: Mrs. Borden, not content with just killing your husband, you would dishonor him as well. Destroy his fine record and reputation by testifying to a mythical phone call. Tell us, who was the mythical person you ask us to believe was on the other end of the line? I don't know. You claim this phone call led to the killing of your husband, and you don't know? No. I see. This is a very harrowing picture you've painted for us, Mrs. Borden. A maddened killer in front of you, and a 10-story drop at your back. Classic picture. Defenseless womanhood with nothing but a.38 caliber revolver in her hand. But naturally, it was well-painted. You and Mr. Scott have made a very artistic team for a very long time. I object! VICTOR: The prosecutor's comments are not pertinent to the case. FORD: I intend to show that they are extremely pertinent. Objection overruled. Cross-examination will continue. Mrs. Borden, were you not indebted to Victor Scott for your education? Yes. I'm grateful to him. FORD: Were you not also indebted to him for your first job, your only job, that of legal assistant in the District Attorney's Office? Yes. Was not your relationship with Victor Scott, who is here in court defending you today, so close that it continued even after your marriage to Ray Borden? Why, yes. Wasn't that somewhat unusual for a married woman? Of course not! I don't know what you mean! Did you, or did you not, visit Victor Scott the day of the murder? Your Honor, I object! The prosecutor knows that self-defense is not murder. Objection sustained. Had not Victor Scott recently thwarted justice in the so-called horse parlor case, a case which you had helped to prepare? Mr. Scott did win the case. Mr. Scott's success in that case was obviously due to his having received prior information concerning our plans. Were you, as my assistant, in a position to give him that information? Your Honor, I object to Mr. Ford laying the blame for his own ineptitude at the door of my client. Mr. Scott, you're out of order. The question here is one of fact, not conjecture. Were you in such a position, Mrs. Borden? Yes. On the night in question, was there any discussion between you and your husband about this leakage of information? Why, yes, there was. And wasn't it your husband's duty as chief investigator to uncover the source of this betrayal of public trust? Yes, it was his... And wasn't it his duty, if he did uncover the pipeline, to report it to me immediately? Yes, but I'm trying... And as a point of fact, did he not uncover it that night? Did he not confront you with your guilt, and did you not murder him to keep him from reporting to me? - No! How can you twist the facts... - I'm twisting nothing. Did you, or did you not, kill your husband to prevent him from doing his duty? No! Answer this, and please answer it carefully. Wasn't this situation, this leakage of information, the direct cause of Ray Borden's death? - Yes, but you... - No further questions. Do you wish to reexamine your witness? Your Honor, I ask for an hour's recess. Has the prosecution any objection? No objection at all, Your Honor. As it is nearly noon, court will resume session at 2:00. I won't let you down. Well, here are the files. Now what do I do? Put them in an envelope and mail it to yourself, registered mail. That ought to keep them out of circulation long enough. It gives me the creeps, like it was your will or something. Hinkel, you're being morbid. Come on, let's go. - Mr. Garland in? - Why, yes, but he's busy at the moment. FRANK: Scratch that all out and take a new letter. This is to confirm our conversation of last Thursday. - We'll finish this later, Dorothy. - Yes, Mr. Garland. Well, Scott, I hear everything is going fine. Then Andy is more optimistic than I am. Why? They haven't smoked out a thing on us so far. - I'm losing the case. - Oh, be a sport. There's always got to be a first time. Sit down. Relax. I'll have some lunch sent in. You're not listening. You're going to be in the middle of this before you know it. There won't be any middle if you lose it fast enough. Impossible. I can't plead the defendant guilty without her consent. What have they got that I don't know about? Well, something they don't know about yet. Now, we've got to get a dismissal before this thing goes any further. How? We'll need some help from Andy. It may take a little of his time, about three years. You're ahead of me, Victor. The prosecution has based its whole case on Ellen being the pipeline. That's the only motive they can show. So I put Andy on as a defense witness. He admits he was the contact man and Ray Borden was the leak. What happens to Andy? They'll prosecute him for corruption of a public official. He'll plead guilty to cut off all embarrassing questions, and get three years at the most. Am I expected to sacrifice Andy just to save Ellen Borden? To save yourself. And by the way, how's your latest girlfriend, Angel O'Hara? How should I know? I threw her out a week ago. Why? I understand, on the day of the alleged murder, she took Ray Borden's phone call at your apartment. That's a direct link to you, Frank. - Who knows about this? - I do. - Anybody else? - Not yet. I don't want to see Ellen Borden take this rap, Frank. Three years isn't a long time, Andy. - You're young. - Not that young. I've done a lot for you. You always wanted to be a gentleman. I made you one. - We've been like a father and son. - Cut it. I'd love to cooperate with you and toss Andy to the wolves, but his character is so poor, he'd probably rat on me. - There's gotta be another way out. - No, there isn't any. Make Ellen Borden look so guilty the prosecution can just sit on its hands. - Well, I've got to go. - You heard me. Lose the case and lose it now. If the lid blows off, don't blame me. I don't blame people. I bury them. That reminds me, if you get trigger-happy, remember all my files relating to you will be on their way to the DA. He was bluffing. Sure, but why did he say it now? Andy, I think Mrs. Borden needs a new lawyer. He's coming out. Been with Garland. Too bad. He was a good DA. Best we ever had. He had a touch. - What happened? - No deal. Let's go. A tail if I ever saw one. Turn down the next street. It's shorter. - It's not much of a street. - It'll do. Right at the next corner. Speed her up a little. What is this? A driving lesson? Stop here. - Here, this is the address. - But I thought you were coming. Plans change. Go on. (WOMEN SCREAMING) Mr. Scott is delinquent. It's after 2:00. Your Honor, I've just been informed that Mr. Scott has been delayed for a reason of extreme seriousness. - Yes, Mr. Ford? - Within the past quarter hour an attempt has been made on Mr. Scott's life. (CROWD GASPING) (GAVEL POUNDING) Do you have any further details? My men killed his assailant and Mr. Scott left the scene in a taxi. They couldn't say whether or not he had sustained any injury. I beg the court's pardon for the delay, but it was unavoidable. So I understand, Mr. Scott. But are you all right? Are you able to continue? Yes, Your Honor. I would like to call my next witness. Miss Angel O'Hara. Is she present in the court? Well, Mr. Scott, is she? Yes. Yes, she is, Your Honor. (CROWD MURMURING) Would you please take the stand? Raise your right hand. Do you solemnly swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth, - so help you God? - Yes, sir. Miss O'Hara, were you in the apartment of Frank Garland at approximately 6:30 on the evening of March the 3rd? Yes, sir. Do you have personal knowledge of a phone call at that time and date? Yes, I have. - Who was the call for? - Mr. Garland. And who made the call? Ray Borden. (CROWD CHATTERING) - VICTOR: You sure of that? - Absolutely, he told me his name. Besides, he was very insulting. You'd heard Mr. Borden's voice on other occasions? Why, of course. I talked to him several times when he came to see Mr. Garland. Will you explain... Vic. Ellen, you're a lawyer. You ought to be able to take it from here. Vic, what's happened? What have they done to you? Don't let them call a recess. Gotta protect that witness. Worth her weight in gold. Mr. Ford, in view of the circumstances and the testimony we've just heard, do you care to proceed with the case? Your Honor, the People move that the case be dismissed in the interest of justice. So ordered. (GAVEL BANGS) Thank you, Vic. Vic, my men are on their way to pick up Frank Garland. And this time, thanks to you, I think the District Attorney's Office will get an indictment. Mr. Scott, the court trusts you will appear before us soon again, but in a less spectacular manner. Ellen, next time I tell you to marry somebody, don't listen to me. Father's orders. I guess this is one he really wanted to win.
