And now, dear friends, the S.S. Erotica proudly presents Suzette. And we ask that you maintain complete silence throughout the ship, thank you. My friend and I wish you two ladies would join us. Will you? Thank you. At our hotel? There's a limousine outside waiting. We'd love to join you. Let's drink a toast. To a beautiful evening. And then she said, "Ooh, you bad boy, you." This is highly irregular, Lieutenant. I'm not certain I have the right to just bust into one of our apartments. You have no search warrant. We'll take the responsibility. That's the door right here. Alright, open it. How do you do, Mr. Kiljen? How do you know my name? We know all about you, Mr. Kiljen. I'm sorry, but we have a job to do. I think we can come to some kind of an arrangement. Are you suggesting a bribe? No soap, and I'll do you a favor, I'll forget you said that. Look, I'll do anything you want. You know I have a lot of influence in this town and I can be of great help to you. Alright, let's go in the other room, we'll talk about it. Alright, you two. Turn around and put your hands on the back of your heads. Sergeant Richards and Walsh, Vice Squad. Your days of impersonating police and of blackmailing fags are over. This one's clean. No wallets, no identification? These bastards are pros. I'll be happy to meet with you in my office, you know where it is. If you'll just excuse us a little longer we- It's bad enough knowing these weirdos run free in this town without having to imitate one. Yeah. Lieutenant, will the name of the hotel be used? Yes, goddamn it, the name of the hotel will be used. You knew what the hell was going on here. I swear I didn't. Isn't there some way we can- Get the hell out of here, you make me sick! Go on, laugh. You dress up like a lousy fairy, risk your life to protect this corrupt town and all you can do is laugh. You want to be one of these new breed cops, huh? Well I'll tell you something, Sergeant Richards. That's just a term thought up by Madison Avenue. Your job is and always will be dealing with scum, depraved, degenerate scum! Like him right there in the other room. And I spit on scum! That new breed crap may be alright coming from a headshrinker or a priest, but me, I'm a cop! Lieutenant, may I have a word with you, please? What is it? Does my name and my indiscretion have to be a part of your police report? Now what do you think? Well, couldn't I somehow be left out? You know my position in this town. Are you gonna tell me all over again the powerful position you have in this town? You got yourself into this hot water, Kiljen. Just be grateful you're not being blackmailed for every cent you've got. You know, frankly, helping a pervert like you makes me sick to my stomach. Mr. Walsh? Do you have a little time to talk with me? What about? Well, a landlady likes to talk with her husband, tenant sometimes. Please, come in. Go on, sit down please, Mr. Walsh. Would you like a cold drink? Perhaps a beer from the refrigerator? No, thank you, I'm not thirsty. Oh, well, me neither on that. I thought you might be. Um, do you enjoy your job, Mr. Walsh? I bet it's exciting and glamorous, a job like that. Detective work, catching famous criminals and people like that. You don't like to talk much about it, do you, Mr. Walsh? I catch queers, Miss Howard. You talk very blunt, Mr. Walsh. Homosexuals, transvestites, child molesters, pimps, pushers, whores. Mr. Walsh, please. By the way, Miss Howard. Yes? My sink is stopped up. Would you mind fixing it, please? Don't stop, don't quit now. I had to take the laundry out. Really now, you can do better than that. Miss Howard, the sink is still stopped up. Oh well, I was going to fix it today. I bought a plunger. Well, it's your apartment house, they're your pipes. I don't care how you do it as long as the water goes down. And now, ladies and gentlemen, the one fortunate enough to inject this elixir of joy into the arm of this angel shall receive the blessed reward reserved usually for those entering the kingdom of paradise. And as her body relaxes she'll reach out to love the one who holds this. Thank you for what you did for me. Lactose. Yes. You put on a pretty good act, though. Almost like the real thing. You know, next time don't flutter your eyes so much, though. How old are you, 19, 20? I'm old enough. I still owe you something, though. What's the matter with you? I like you, I just want you to like me. They wind you up and you perform. Christ! What's the matter with you? I like you. I want you to like me. Tell me something. How many times have you done this? You mean my act? Not too many times, three or four. I've only worked here a week or so. Do you know what your last words to me are going to be when you leave here? What? You're going to say, Angel, you've made me very happy. I can make a man happy, you know. Really. Yeah, I guess you can. What about you and that Pyrano? I had no money and he gave me this job, that's all. He's been very kind to me. Haven't many people been kind to you? No. - Where you from? Salinas. Why did you leave, wasn't there a young man in Salinas that wanted to be kind to you? No. What were you doing there? My father lived there and with a different woman every few months. He didn't care whether I was around or not, so, I just decided to leave. Mr. Pyrano picked me up, but he told me I was different, not like the others. Please, won't you let me make love to you? Thanks, Angel, but I don't think so. I only want to make you happy. You, especially. Why me especially? I don't know. I only know I want to. Please, let me make love to you. Just lie down. There's not gonna be any lovemaking, Angel. Look, I'm a police officer, Vice Squad. In exactly two minutes this whole place is gonna be raided and everybody arrested on morals charges. You won't believe this, but I've never been busted in my life. I oughta have my head examined, but I believe you've only been in this racket for a week. Come on, let's get out of here! How? I don't know I just want to get you out of here. Why do you? I don't know. It's like it's blowing my mind. I want to get you out of here. Oh, I oughta have my head examined! Come on! You go around back, hold everyone. Hey there's somebody getting away on a bike. It's Walsh! I think there's somebody with him. Forget him, go around back! Hey, wait a minute, let me turn on the light. It's very cozy. It's a dirty, cluttered mess. Then let me clean it up for you. Now wait a minute, Angel. You do me a favor? Just leave everything the way it is, huh? I still don't know why I'm doing this. Do you always let things get like this? I'm not here that much and I never bring anybody else here. Please, I'd like to clean it up for you. Look, I didn't bring you up here to wash dishes. Then why did you bring me here? Not for that, either. Now, why don't you just relax, huh? Can't you believe there are guys in this world, even total strangers, who don't want to push you into bed? I'm letting you stay here because tomorrow morning, bright and early, I'm putting you on a bus right back to Salinas. I told you, Mr. Walsh, I'm not going back to Salinas. I'm of age, I'll look for another job here. I'll get myself my own apartment. I will, Mr. Walsh! Now- Are you in there, Mr. Walsh? I heard voices, Mr. Walsh. Are you there? What is it? Well, I thought if it wasn't too inconvenient I could fix your sink. Never mind, I'll take care of it. But I have a plunger. How long has this meat been in the refrigerator? I don't know. It's turning green. Well, then leave it alone. Why do you live like this? Because I'm a bachelor. Bachelors live like this. Some don't. How do you know? Because, Mr. Walsh, I'm not a child and I don't pretend to be one. I've seen quite a bit of life, you know. Yeah, seen quite a bit of bachelors, too, huh? Oh, you're such a Puritan. Where you going? To throw the meat out. Dressed like that? Well, I washed my clothes and hung them on the towel rack to dry. I'm only going to the trash can down the hallway. I have a good shape and I like showing it. Is that alright? Yeah, yeah, sure. I'm sorry I got angry. Maybe I could get a job modeling. I mean legitimate modeling, clothes and things. Look, I've practiced the walk. Mr. Walsh, don't look at me, please, I'm going to iron this shirt. Do you know what my name is? Your name is Angel. No, that's not my real name. My real name's Laurie. That's a nice name. Do you like it? Laurie's a very pretty name. Will you call me Laurie? I want you, just you, to call me Laurie. Mr. Walsh, make love to me, please. Don't, don't say that. Don't you ask me to, because I want to very much. I'm getting a job! Why didn't you use my phone upstairs? Well, I was out for a walk and I forgot the time. I had to call exactly at noon. What kind of job is it? Modeling, for a dress designer. You got the job? No, I just got an interview. Oh. Bob, don't be such a detective with me. Oh, I'm sorry. That's alright. Hey, I went by the health food store and got a bunch of that organic stuff you said was good for you. Look at this. Let's go upstairs and eat it. Yeah, well first I better take myself a shower. You know, I've been in some pretty crummy places today. Come on. You're beautiful. Am I? Yes. Tell me. What's my name? Oh, your name, uh, is Laurie. And you don't disapprove of Laurie, do you? No. Hold me tight. Oh, I like you holding me, Mr. Walsh. I thought we put an end to that Mr. Walsh business, huh? Bob. That's better. You know what my friends would say if they were here? No. They would say look at Bob and Laurie. See how beautiful they are? Will you meet my friends sometime? They live by the beach. I know you'd like them. Alright, I'll meet your friends. You'd have to understand them a little. I'll try. This weekend? Yes. Well, where the hell have you been? Relax, I'm here. I've been standing by this garbage for over an hour! Everybody ready? Yes, now let's go before we miss the floor show! OK. We were told by Mitch you have a good show here. Yeah. Where you guys from? New York City. Philadelphia. You guys with the convention? Well, I'm in kitchen appliances and Ben here, he's in hardware. Did Mitch tell you it was 20 bucks to get in? Boy, that's a lot, that's a lot of money. Hey, this is a lot of show. Here you go. Mind if I sit down next to you? I'm a masseuse, no kidding. For five dollars I'll give you a very special treatment, very relaxing. I just came here to look. Now go bother somebody else. Honey, you don't want to do it with your eyeballs. Screw off. Patrol cars coming up both ends of the alley. Take it easy! Are you alright? What the hell was that all about? Well, you didn't have to get so rough with the girl. Hey, one look and anyone could see what kind of a pig she was! I was only trying to do what you'd do. Bob? You're someone that I've worked for and admired. Now I don't know anymore. Tell me. How do you feel about these people? I'm not required to have feelings. Look, I didn't ask you to be clever with me, I ask as a friend. Some of them are lost, confused, I feel sorry for them. The others, they're criminals and for them I feel only contempt. Bob, you alright? Huh? Yeah, yeah, sure. Hey, let's go out and have a couple drinks, huh? No, no. Gotta file our report. Well, after the report. No. OK. I'll go get the car, bring it around the alley. Huh? I said I'll bring the car around to the alley. Yeah, sure. Come, live with me and be my love. And we will all the pleasures prove that hills and valleys, dales and fields or woods or steepy mountain yields. And we will sit upon the rocks and see the shepherds feed their flocks by shallow rivers. To whose falls melodious birds sing madrigals. And I will make thee beds of roses and a thousand fragrant posies. A cap of flowers and a kirtle embroidered all with leaves of myrtle. A gown made of the finest wool which from our pretty lambs we pull. Fur-lined slippers for the cold with buckles of the purest gold. A belt of straw and ivy buds with coral clasps and amber studs. And if these pleasures may thee move come live with me and be my love. The shepherd's swains shall dance and sing for thy delight each May morning. If these delights thy mind may move then live with me and be my love. Well, aren't you going to stop now, Angel? Leave us alone. Hello, Angel. Well, Sergeant, you've been had. You've been had good. You're a police sergeant on the Vice Squad and this whole setup, from the moment you met Angel to now has been carefully planned. All of it. All planned so that a group of witnesses could observe you assaulting Angel. Nobody was assaulted here. Angel is only 17. What do you want? I brought you here to meet someone, Sergeant Walsh. You're lucky this time. I only did the job for someone else. Who? It's beautiful, isn't it? Cut the crap, Kiljen. What do you want? You must make it perfectly clear, and to the newspapers especially, that I was working with you all the time. And that I knew very well that it was you and Sergeant Richards at the motel that night and that I was only your decoy. That's what I want, Sergeant, nothing more. To prove my intentions I'm going to give you the negatives and prints of the photos I had taken. What about the testimony of a 17 year old girl? Well, I'm afraid you'll have to talk that over with Mr. Pyrano, or maybe with the girl herself. Mr. Walsh, can I speak to you? It's Angel. Mr. Walsh? Mr. Walsh, please let me in. I know you're in there, I saw your car outside. What do you want? I have to talk to you. Mr. Walsh, I care about you. Out there, that's where you belong with the pimps and the whores. What did, what did Pyrano send you here for, huh? He didn't send me here. I came here by myself to tell you I'm sorry. Are you really 17? Yes, but I didn't want to hurt you. I wanted to quit everything I was doing. Mr. Pyrano scared me. You little tramp! Come on, get up. Go, get up off that goddamn floor. 17, huh? Angel face, huh? Don't! 17! I raped you, huh? I'm going to show you what rape looks like! What it's really like! I'm going to rape you good! I'm going to rape you good, Angel, baby! Walsh, this is Mr. Pyrano. Have you seen Angel? I want you and her to be at the main house tomorrow for lunch. You will wait outside near the telephone. I will call you when it's time to come in. Be there. Do my neck, here. Oh, this is yours. There is a thousand dollars in there. You'll get a payment like that every month, plus there's special bonuses, like tonight. What's tonight? I have to transport, personally, a very important package. I trust no one but myself to do it. I need an unmarked police car. I need you as I'll need Angel. What's in the package? None of your business. Since you're one of us now, I've instructed the girls to keep you satisfied, completely. What have you always dreamt of doing to a woman? It's amazing what can satisfy some people. I believe we can trust him now. Yes, I believe we can trust him just fine. You've been acting very carefully tonight, Sergeant Walsh. That's right, Pyrano. The least attention we attract the better I like it. Now you figure out why. That's what I always liked about you. You're smart enough to know how to protect yourself, thereby protecting me. There is a camper parked right around the corner. You go and park us right in back of it. Unit two, this is Sergeant Richards. The stuff you're after is in the camper. Pursue only the camper, close in. Police! You goddamn cop, you get me out of here now! Mr. Walsh, lose them! You fool, you'll kill us all! You idiot! You'll find this is a mistake, officer. Ask your own Sergeant Walsh over there whether you've got the right man. Walsh, damn it, you tell them! Listen to me, he's been making it with that chick. She's 17 years old! No, it isn't true. He never touched me. He never touched me. He raped her! She confessed it to me! Go on, you tell them, Angel! About this police sergeant and you, tell them everything he did to you! Look, I don't get it. How come? I love you, Mr. Walsh. She's dead. Walsh, tell them I was working for you! Why the hell don't you tell them? Your Sergeant Walsh was working for me, you hear? You cop bastard! You son of a bitch! If I go, then so do you! He raped a 17 year old girl, he raped her! Why aren't you arresting him? Why aren't you arresting him!
