How are we to live? The sun does not move! How truly are we to make people live? May the sun grow stronger through our sacrifice. Let us all die! SAHAGUN's INFORMANTS You're a damn pig. . . There will be around 64 families... The love I have inside... The school fees. . . I have waited for the same bus for five years. . . The same time of day at the same place. I wonder, just out of curiosity, if it will take a long time before I decide to stop doing that. And I told him, ''Do you need my answer?'' It's hard for me not to be sad. I don't care for promises of a better world. It's the only chance I've got to pass this test. If I fail I'm fucked for life. It's got to wear off, you'll see. Meanwhile, keep telling me. Fucking prick didn't want a commitment. He wanted me to still be a ''missy.'' ''Missy'' from there and ears only, because he damn well loved to do all those other disgusting things. They call the good things customs. I call them fear. . . Yeah, well, you should've dumped him a long time ago. It's better for you to stay like this than to play ball with that bunch of assholes. Fucking impotents. Asshole. . . But you've been very lucky. . . I'm shit-scared. . . Would you mind telling me where the damn advantage is. . .? That's it, when the days take hold of me, I concentrate and let my instincts do the walking. That way my spirit doesn't wane. . . If you don't pay me now, when will you? I'll give it to you in the afternoon. They owe me some money, too. But for sure, because it's been too much already. It's always the same thing. I shouldn't trust you anymore. . . Lost money, nothing lost. . . He asked me if I was happy, and I told him, ''Do you need my answer?'' Because I don't know, but I can't say that I am either. I'm sure there are others who will die and don't even imagine it. Her name is Emilia. Yeah right, like she's gonna talk to you! -she already did. -Really? Yeah, since yesterday. And I like her a lot. Wow! How cool is that. Come close to me. Kiss me. Hold me. Why won't you talk to me anymore? some call it a habit. I call it fear. . . Listen closely to what I am going to tell you before anything happens to you. surely there are others who will die and don't even imagine it. Oh, beautiful Ryo, the vigorous one. There will come a powerful mate for you. Like a slice of heaven, his vigor will be great. He is like that, perfect, magnificent. Impetuous current, go. Meet with him. It's in your hands. May your eyes be alert. Be careful. Do not fear. Go forth and free the world from this disgrace. Love will be your guide. Hello, good evening, this is Alejandra speaking.
