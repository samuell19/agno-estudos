1-206, calling Earth. - Reply, please. - Contact made. Kerian Berner. Killed in battle. Maleva Kerstein. Doctor of Biochemistry. Killed in a car accident. Both have the required characteristics... and have been reincarnated by our two envoys. Remember... the success of your mission depends on your ability... to take advantage of the superstitions that still prevail among humans. Attention. First task to carry out: Wurster Fairground. This is the world we must conquer. Its inhabitants are weak beings, undermined by their own passions. Wouldn't it be easier to destroy them? Of course. We could cause their nuclear weapons to explode... and disintegrate them... but we need the Earth intact. - How long do we have? - Not much. Our planet is about to die, and we still haven't create an artificial atmosphere. Life conditions on Earth are identical to the ones on Ummo. Our objective is to invade it. Destroy and dominate its habitants so our race can survive here. - Do you think we will succeed? - Indeed. But success or failure entirely depends on the work we do. We must be the most efficient ones. These are the mortal remains of Count Janos of Mialhoff... the fearsome vampire whose horrible crimes sowed panic and anguish... among the inhabitants of the fascinating lands of Transylvania. Legend has it that he could only be taken down... by plunging a wooden stake in his heart. From him, hypnotic power... has been passed on throughout the centuries and inherited... only by those like me who descend from people... who were dominated, attacked and corrupted by the vampire. For a few coins, I will hypnotize you... and I will read yourfuture in your sleepy eyes... as well as... how much love, passion and jealousy there are in them... Love, passion... Humans' biggest weakness. Feelings canceled and overcome on our planet. Don't be afraid. My beautiful assistant is an experienced nurse. Ask him to tell you your future. And promise him you'll reveal yours tonight. Who wants to be the first? If the girl comes, let me handle it. Don't fear. She will assist you if you faint... when hearing the terrible revelations of the unknown. FORTUNE TELLER Come up, please. Beautiful women are powerful magnets. We will use them to lure scientists, generals, statesmen... into revealing their vital secrets. We don't have a lot of material to base our research on. No fingerprints or known enemies. - It seems to be the doing of a ghost. - Let's discard ghosts. What about the gelatinous substance found on the stake? We sent it to the laboratory with the victim's clothes. - Right. - I haven't received the results yet. There is something that intrigues me. The disappearance of the skeleton. You know the legend. The only way... to bring a vampire back to life is by pulling the stake out of his heart. The skeleton is only a hawker's trick... but if there is a logical reason for both his and the girl's disappearance... What measures will you take? As usual, Henry, I have a lot of work. Have a look and try to find something out. All right. But don't bring any vampires to this office, will you? - Why? - I am a bit anemic. Yeah, that's obvious. We'll call her Ylonka. She will be the first one... of a group of beautiful women who will obey my orders blindly. The Prince of Darkness is fast asleep. An excellent material for our studies. Do you think human beings could be contaminated... if we injected them with vampire's blood? We'll find out soon. LIBRARY Good evening. Good evening. - Could you tell me... - l'm sorry, sir, but we're closing now. Detective Tobermann. Criminal investigation. How can I help you? Do you have a book about monsters by Professor Ulrich von Frankenstein? How strange. Nobody has inquired about it in all my years here... and today you are the second one to do it in a matter of seconds. - Who was the other person? - Actually, it was a couple. The woman was young and beautiful. Her skin was like made of wax. The man was tall... thin... and harsh, with cold eyes. - Thank you. Go up to the microfilm room. There you'll find Mr. Carl. - He'll give you the book. - Thanks again. MANUSCRIPT ARCHIVE LIBRARIAN STABBED HIS ATTRACTIVE ASSISTANT DISAPPEARED SUSPECTED ACCOMPLICE Come on in. Knife wound on endocardium and mitral valve damaged. I call that a stab in the heart. There is something else. Follow me. A sample of the gelatinous substance found on the victim's clothes. It's made up of living cells that I haven't been able to identify. We'll have to study them more thoroughly. All right. But do it quickly. It could be a lead. Don't jump to conclusions, Heinrich. Apart from the gelatin... is there any other evidence that connects this murder with the hawker's? Yes. Anthology of the Monsters. This book is an exhaustive study of monster legends created by men. The living mummy... which is said to be hidden somewhere in the Valley of Kings, Egypt. Nosferatu. The medieval vampire that roamed the Transylvania region. The Golem. A giant made of clay created in Prague's ghetto. The missing pages... Thank you. ...deal with the creation... of an artificial human being... - Thank you. ...by Frankenstein. However, listen to this. The end is intact. "I wanted to create a perfect human being by choosing the best organs... from different bodies. But, alas, God punished my arrogance. Fate decreed that I should graft the brain of a murderer... in a human being that I thought was perfect. Today, I will blow up the castle and I'll bury myself with this monster. God have mercy on my soul." - Am I boring you, Eva? - Not at all. It is very interesting. Well, there is more. The werewolf. The werewolf? Yes, that's right. Another nightmarish creature. The only way to free him from his curse... was by shooting him in his heart with a silver bullet. The werewolf... Does it remind you of anything? Yes, I think so. When I was little, my grandma or my nanny... I can't remember who, told me about that legend. It was about a man who turned into a wolf because of the influence of the moon. I think there is a word to describe it. - Lycanthropy. - Yes. Exactly. Lycanthropy. Those stories are mere superstitions. - Yes, but... - Please... The flowers are withered... but Waldemar's body, the werewolf, is uncorrupted... waiting for someone to revive it. MYSTERIOUS DISAPPEARANCE OF TWO NURSES POLICE SHOCKED AT BLOODSHED STARTING A THOROUGH INVESTIGATION The silver bullet in his heart only immobilizes him... so his death is only apparent. His death would be final only if the bullet was shot by a woman... who loved him enough to die with him. Ylonka. You'll give him the serum that will prevent him from becoming a beast. You will be responsible for him. No power will prevent the vampire from infecting human beings. Orthe mummy's. A blind assassin that only obeys Egyptian cabbalas. Or the monster of Frankenstein. We will release thousands of them... against the race that inhabits this planet. I had a strange feeling when I touched... Waldemar's skin. The same feeling I had when I was with Fersar. Is it a man or a monster? Both. The eternal dilemma of the human race. Good... or evil. It is beyond belief. Four women disappear... without any trace, and two murders take place... in a quiet town which wonders... who will be the next victim. Come in! - The laboratory report, sir. - Thank you. Unbelievable. Those useless people say they can't identify the gelatinous substance... that the molecular structure... is different to anything they've ever seen. I have certain suspicions. Let me investigate this matter for a few days. All right. But only for a few days. - Thank you. - Good luck. I'll need it. - Hilda's parties are real fun. - Yes, but get off me. Stop! Don't ruin it. I'm sorry. - Shall I take you home? - Oh, I forgot my shawl. It's blue. I'll go and get it. No, Detective. Truder was a good girl. All my clients liked her. Last night, we had full moon. - Pardon? - lt's nothing. - Anything else? - A strange client comes every night. They say he bought the old castle from Dr. Warnoff. That's him. OK. Thank you. - Whiskey and water. - Right away. It seems harmless, but it's not. It's used to make people confess. To extract secrets out of spies. Ultrasonic waves so high-pitched... they pierce the brain. But on this occasion, we will use it as a punishment. Ylonka, I told you to keep an eye on him. Waldemar's escape could have endangered our plans. I trust this should serve as an example. Stop! That's enough! Don't ever forget it. Compassion is a weakness. Contact made. The tomb of Tao-Tet's mummy has been located. It's is on the rocky hillside of Mount... hypogeum of King Amon Ra. Solid gold mirror. Its light reflections upon the mummy... transmit him the orders. Come in, Marta! I was waiting for a friend. I thought it was her. I'm Detective Tobermann. Criminal Investigation. I'd like to talk to you about last night. Come on up, please. Excuse me for a second. You don't remember me. Take a seat, please. No, you don't remember me, do you? - To be honest... - You graduated three years before me. Oh, yes. But back then you were... I know. You can say it. I was a skinny girl with freckles... and you were the captain of the rugby team. The truth is that you've changed a lot. But let's talk... about last night. I don't expect you to believe me. Your colleague didn't. Let's say I'm more aware of the issue. Do you have any other information? Not about last night, but my father, Judge Stember... had an extraordinary experience when he was young. Did he? He met the werewolf in person. In person? I need to talk to your father. - Come on in, please. - No, no. - Why not? Come on. - No, no. Dr. Warnoff is directing his movements. As you can see... this is only the official report of your daughter's attack. But that night there was a full moon. Your daughter told me you met the werewolf in person. Yes, it's true. I assure you it was an awful experience. Something that the human mind refuses to accept. But it did happen. My wife. She died seven years ago. Waldemar Daninsky was in love with her before I met her. He was an ordinary man. Like you... or like me. A man from a good family, cultured and intelligent... until, God knows how, a terrible curse fell upon him... by which he turned into a werewolf when there was full moon. It's unbelievable... that such horrors can be repeated. I'll do everything I can to help you. He was about to hypnotize you. I wonder if living on this planet... much younger than ours... where the air is much more vigorous and the sun rays more intense... taking up the bodies... of these weaker beings... will not end up turning us as well... into stupid and sentimental beings like them. It was a moment of weakness. On this planet that we're trying to take over... wars have been lost and empires have been destroyed... due to moments of weakness. The mummy is perfect for us. Its heart is dry. It doesn't beat, it's dead... ...it doesn't feel. A cadaver that obeys and destroys. Tomorrow, I'll go find the other perfect being. The Monster of Frankenstein. He doesn't have a heart, either. He can't feel anything. He only has a brain that obeys orders. His strength... is electrical power. But we will make him even more powerful. I will take Waldemar with me. Kerian and you, Maleva, will stay here to protect the castle. Maleva. Maleva! Kerian. Kerian! Any news? I have the lab report of the girl who was murdered in the street. The hair in her nails is not human. It's from an unknown animal. Good. This clears many things up. We will go to the cemetery. I want to check something out. But I don't want to leave Ilsa here alone. She can stay at the commissioner's. - Yes, she'll be safe there. - Of course. Untie him. It's a test. I want to make sure he obeys my orders. No! I said it was just a test. The result has been satisfactory. Ylonka, soon there will be a full moon. Inject the serum into Waldemar. Double the dose. - It was a cruel test. - Cruel? In our galaxy, which is decomposing and dying, nothing is cruel. We're fighting for our survival, and between dying and killing, it's clear. I'm afraid that the idea of using human bodies... will cause us problems. Why? Why do you help me? I don't know. I really don't know. Maybe... I do it because I'm a woman. But you are WarnofFs slave. You're wrong. I'm not his slave anymore. Let's run away from here. Don't be afraid. I'm not here to stop you. Go. Go! - What would you like, sir? - A brandy, please. There you go. Another one, please. The other night... when you were in my arms... I felt something strange. Something, I don't know... Something I cannot explain. - Like an obsession... - Yes, like the waking up... of something... that we lived a long time ago and we had forgotten. Like... a lost and distant dream... that one day, without knowing why... and fascinates us... They may be dormant passions... the weaknesses Dr. Warnoff... told us about. No! Kerian! Kerian! Hello? What? Where? When? Stay there. I'm on my way. What's the matter? Why aren't you at Gluke's? I'm tired of feeling like a prisoner. My dad won't tell me what's going on. Be reasonable, Ilsa. It's not safe to be here alone. I'm not alone now, am I? Why do you think I called you? You're a cheat. Don't take it as a punishment, although it could be. You let Ylonka and Waldemar escape. You let your emotions control you. We cannot achieve our goal like this. You need to kill your emotions... and forget everything. Do you understand why I have to do this? Yes. I'm a woman, and therefore I have intuition. You're doing this for the same reason you killed Kerian. Because you're jealous. That's why you want me to forget about him. You've been contaminated, too. You love, too. You can't deny it. You'd better get dressed. Commissioner Gluke. No, she's all right. Yes, sir. She's at her apartment now. How do I know? Well... Get dressed, will you? She's perfectly all right. Get dressed! I take full responsibility. Stop! No, commissioner, I wasn't talking to you. Listen, chief... there's something else. I think I have a lead. Stop! Stop doing that! A stranger has bought the old castle. Dr. Warnoff. OK, chief. I'll have a look. Good bye. Ilsa! Stop playing around and get dressed! Don't you like me without freckles? Ilsa, don't be childish. I'll take you to Gluke's house. I found out Stember's address. It's the district judge. Are you sure about this? You'll be arrested. You know that, don't you? Yes, I do. I am cursed. There is no hope for me. No. There isn't... for either of us. I will only find peace... -...if a silver bullet... -...is shot by a woman... who loves you enough to die for you. It's strange. Since I was a little girl... I always dreamed of... Dr. Warnoff? Please, come in. He's waiting for you. One of your kind is coming to see us. One of my kind? In a way, yes. The reincarnation system is failing. Something from the subjugated race prevails. A certain sensitivity... to physical contact. It might be an imperceptible nuance... in voice tones... in the expression of the eyes... something I can't quite define. Do you consider me to be your enemy? No. How can I consider you as my enemy... if you are under my total control? Come in. 287. Shall I speed up the preparation? Yes, please. Write this down. Two cubic centimeters. Good evening, Detective Tobermann. Good evening, Dr. Warnoff. - I think we've already met. - Yes, at the Golden Egg. I'm sorryl can't deal with you personally, but, as you can see, I'm very busy. You must be wondering about the reason of my visit. I already know. Your suspicions are well-founded... although you still don't understand what's going on. Am I right? Yes. You seem a bit confused, Detective. Those screens behind you... will explain some things. You'd be surprised if I told you I come from planet Ummo... about 14 light years from here. It would be very presumptuous to believe that Earth... is the only inhabited planet in the whole universe. And regarding the legends of vampires, mummies, werewolves... monsters of Frankenstein, what do you think? Many fantasies have come true, thanks to modern science. Heart, kidney and cornea transplants... Virtually everything can be replaced. I have no doubt the monsters of Frankenstein can be created. We've been performing those techniques for centuries. Our mission here is to study the creation... of monsters that will eventually destroy humanity... without exposing ourselves. Supposing you were telling the truth... why do you reveal your intentions? Because I know the future. Yours, even. Do you want to know what will happen to you tonight? Do you know her? Ilsa. You didn't expect to witness her abduction, did you? Tonight... she will be our guest. - What does this mean? - Positive factor. And now, the most interesting thing. Your own future. Pay attention. You are not the first human being that has tried to spoil our plans. Those bones you see are what is left of the other intruders. The bats will wake up... they will fly around you... and when they realize you are defenseless... they will attack your eyes... until they leave your sockets empty and bloody. Incredible, isn't it? Yes. Beyond belief. Commissioner Gluke. We're extremely worried about the fact that your department... hasn't solved any of the recent murders and disappearances. Besides, that Dr. Warnoff... Mayor, one of my best men, Detective Tobermann... has gone to the castle to see him. I'm waiting for his report. Gentlemen... I have some information that I've concealed until now... for special reasons. And I want to remind you that after my daughter's disappearance... my interest in this matter is more personal than yours. Judge Stember, we are trying to find your daughter. Her disappearance disturbs all of us, but tell me... what is this information, and why haven't you revealed it? Because I knew nobody would believe me. Gentlemen, do you remember Waldemar Daninsky? Well, then, we thought he was dead, but he is alive. I saw him, and I talked to him. He is somehow connected to the strange events at the castle. Commissioner Gluke... we can't waste our time with legal formalities. All right, go and see what's happening at the castle... but don't do anything until I get a search warrant. ls that clear? Hurry! Don't get distracted. Get out of here, now. Where is Ilsa? I don't know. She might be lost in the corridors. Ilsa? Ilsa? Ilsa! - Are you going to arrest Dr. Warnoff? - Move aside. I can't say anything. Ilsa! There is no point anymore. I lost control over them. The monster of Frankenstein. Take position around the castle. Dr. Warnoff... If you don't come out of the castle at once... we will enter. By force, if necessary. Back off, please! Watch all the exits! Back off. Do not get any closer. We are trapped. Let's get out of here before the two currents of gas join. There is no point in trying to escape, Dr. Warnoff. Failure has a price. Can you still tell us something useful? Yes, it won't be easy to destroy them. Their passions, which we saw as weaknesses... are what makes them strong. Much more so than their nuclear weapons. Do you think we can destroy those feelings? Without them, would it be worth living? There is no choice. It's about our survival. Anything else? I take full responsibility for this failure. Can she be saved? You forget Dr. Carstein... stopped living on Earth a long time ago. As long as there are men ready to sacrifice themselves for others... nobody will destroy us. THE END
