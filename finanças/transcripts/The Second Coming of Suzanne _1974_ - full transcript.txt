Alright, somebody give me somethin'. You actually believe that people are going to pay money to see this. It's time for your medicine, Percy. 'Dry up, huh?' Look, I think I can save you a lot of legwork by telling you that there is not 'a responsible financial establishment in the country' 'that would put up one dime in support of this property.' You bastards. [instrumental music] [male #1] 'Hey, Logan, here comes your banker.' Good morning. I'm Mr. Fenton with First Security. Beautiful day, isn't it? I haven't seen one of your pictures, Mr. Logan but I...I suspect that I will in the very near future. All of this, uh, this paper here is fairly standard. [Fenton] 'Here is where we spell out.' 'Uh, interest rates and a proportionate increase in the event of payment deferral. This gives us some leeway. I, uh.. A.. A-a margin, so to speak.. ...in the event of, uh, um.. Mr. Logan, why is he taking pictures of me? That's enough, Heath. This, this is.. Look, Fenton, all this bullshit's getting to be a bore. [Logan] 'Now, just give me your papers and let's cut it short.' I said give me your papers and give me the check and let's get out of here. Come on. Look...there are certain procedures. What do you do, Fenton? Do? I'm an executive vice president with First Security. No, I mean, what do you do? What, I, I do many things. I...I'm the banker. A bank officer has a vast array of responsibilities. What do you really do? What I do is a hell of a lot clearer than what you do. What the hell is this? You? You're a painter, you're a serious painter. You're an artist. You paint imaginary lines and divide up the universe and you don't know anything about it, do you? Go away. No, I'd like to talk to you about how I can see you're a serious artist and a troubled man. I can tell by your eyes-- I wanna talk to her alone, alright? Do you know who is she? Will you go away? [Logan] 'Boy, I've never seen you before.' 'Are you with him?' - Let's go. - No, don't go. I want to go, come on now. Do you like film? 'Of course you do.' ♪ Life is but a dream ♪ ♪ Row row row your boat ♪ ♪ Gently down the stream ♪ ♪ Merrily merrily ♪ ♪ Merrily merrily ♪♪ Do you know what I mean? That's black art. But that's pure art. But that's so inside. Art, I thought art's more of a communication thing. It's more out, outside, outgoing. Art is anything that is...that is uniquely ours. - 'Anything?' - 'Anything.' Well, it's, it's, it's all very interesting and, uh, it's funny. But you're not laughing. Well.. ...we have to go now because, uh, I've gotta go to work. [Logan thinking] I'll get you, I'll get you, Suzanne. 'He's crazy, you know that. He's really crazy.' I know. Is that what scares you? We're all crazy. [instrumental music] [Logan] 'In my last life, I was a carpenter.' 'Before that, I was a soldier in the Spanish Inquisition.' 'And before that, I was Caiaphas.' 'That's the one that really gets to me.' [Suzanne] 'Who's he?' [Logan] 'I was a legend of my own time.' 'I was the high priest' 'who conspired to destroy Christ and succeeded.' 'Who were you in your last life?' [Suzanne] 'I don't know.' [Logan] 'Oh, you know.' What're you doing? Oh, you mean where am I going? No, I mean, what you're doing when you roll your eyes up like this? Like that. I have this, this thing that happens to me sometimes. I have this pressure on my chest and on my face.. [instrumental music] It's around here somewhere. [Suzanne] 'Does it feel good?' [Logan] 'It's not a thing that feels, that feels good or bad.' 'It's just, it's just something I do.' Talk about good karma, Suzanne. You must have been a saint in your last life. [Logan] 'It's like looking through a-a magic window' 'or a child's window .' And I can see that life is infinite. And it goes...through space and time. We're god, Suzanne. [Logan] 'You and I are gods.' We're immortal, our spirits are immortal, I know it. I can feel it. I can feel it in my gut! It's like the feeling you get when you listen to a p-piece of great music. [Logan] 'Everything falls away.' 'And for a moment, just a moment..' ...you're at rest. And, you know at that moment that you can't turn back or change because that feeling goes on forever. [applauds] Bravo, bravo. [Suzanne] 'I'm just not comfortable' 'with all your talk about spirit' and the inner world, that's all.' You think it's a lie? [Suzanne] 'The words mean nothing. They don't even count.' You say you want me to know your soul. Well, alright, I'm here. I'm interested. But you can't know a man's soul by hearing him talk about it. That's the lie. What's the truth? It's not what you say, Logan.. ...it's what you are. [tires screeching] Are you alright? [airplane flying above] Can't...can't you see, I'm trying to work? I...just-- Will you leave me alone? I just have to tell you, would you please fasten your seat belt? Put the air conditioning on, will ya? Gotta make it to the office in 20 minutes.. ...and safely and swiftly. Alright, Suzanne. You're the Christ, Suzanne. This is how I see you and this is what you are. Sit down. [Logan] 'Suzanne.' I know you. Suzanne! You're no more Christ than I am. All your fuckin' goodness makes me wanna puke! Jesus Christ, who the hell do you think you are? Suzanne! [Logan] 'How dare you!' 'Suzanne!' 'I'll get you!' 'Suzanne!'

[eerie music] [male #2] 'The thing that makes me most mad' 'is when, when people who have powers of certain kinds..' ...uh, unfairly exercise it over other people. [male #3] 'What's bothering you?' 'I don't understand it unless it's just a strange' 'quirk in the American character that I've mentioned before.' The richest Caesar never had it as good as you. Simple arithmetic tells me that most of you're watching this broadcast on your color televisions. You're plugged into fantastic sources of information through radio and newspapers. I wanna tell you this. What more do you demand from your civilization in order to maintain belief in it? If you go to another war, kiss my black ass. Alright, maybe you don't count materialistic virtues but let me tell you, without them we could not indulge charity, liberality, and equality. And we do indulge these things. This nation is the most generous in history. We give away more wealth each year than most countries could produce in a century. Philosophically and politically we have been on a slow but definite swing toward the humanistic liberal ways of thinking. This trend shall continue. But only in direct proportion to our comfort. This cold but human fact is often forgotten. We are only generous when first we are secure and comfortable. We only develop ethics when we have a rich civilization that gives us the free time to ponder. It is clear to any student of history that this nation is a great one, even a noble one. Nowhere near perfect, yet, but heading for a long time now in a positive direction. And it is high time that these unfashionable concepts be voiced publicly once again. Know this, if you have no faith belief or trust in your society.. If you're embarrassed by its imperfections it's not because this is a bad society but simply because we have lost sight of our greatness. Thank you and good evening. Alright, how did it look? Did it work okay? Fine. It's wet. [instrumental music] [grunts] [music continues] [music continues] [music continues] [screaming] I! I! Am! A man! [male #4] 'She's not like the other autistic children.' 'She is deeply contented.' 'And there is something.' 'She's formed a new attachment.' 'A volunteer girl, Suzanne, it's good.' [female #1] Please save it, peaches. I know all about it. Three years and what the hell have you accomplished? Nothing. Where's the breakthrough we used to dream about? Where's just one inch of improvement? Where is just one word out of Dorothy's own mouth? Tell me that. I don't think you understand. I understand plenty, more than you think. It kills me to admit it but she's retarded, that's all. And none of your fancy psychological jargon is gonna change that. Nothing could be further from the truth. Tell me about the truth. The truth is you're right about the fancy jargon. None of it applies to Dorothy. She doesn't fit any of the pigeonholes. In other words, you haven't the slightest idea what's wrong with her. Look, that's just it. There's really nothing wrong with her. She's a wonderful girl. We know from her play that she's unbelievably bright. But she just won't communicate. No words. She has her own way. Matter of fact, she seems happy that way. There's no name for that condition. You make one up if you like. Dorothy is one of a kind. Do you understand that? She is absolutely unique. Helen, look. [Jackson] My youth.. Now, you don't really want to hear about my youth, do you? You ever read Tom Sawyer? Well, it wasn't anything like that at all. 'Ceptin' I grew up on the river. Pikes County, Missouri. And let me tell you, we were poor, hurtin' poor.. The kind of poor you can only understand if you went without real food for a couple of days at a time. God, I wanted so much more.. ...and I got it. Yes, I did. You think I set my goals impossibly high? I have a bachelor's secret. And it works. I put on those blinders. I tell you, you put 'em on. The tunnel vision, you see nothin' else. You work your tail off. You're push and you run. Even crawl if you have to. And then suddenly you take the time to turn around and look back. And you realize that you've come an incredibly long way. You've reached your goals. My columnists indicated 473 cities. I write my own editorials on network television. I own two newspapers and three three TV stations. But I must admit something confidentially. You know it's funny but I still don't feel any closer to that star than I did as a dumb kid in Pikes County. [helicopter whirrs] [helicopter whirrs] [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] I no longer.. [banging noise] [rock music blaring] [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [upbeat rock music] [snorts] [rock music] See, the banker paid off. What the fuck kind of a production meeting is this? [all laughing] This is where it's all gonna happen. And the sky is gonna be churning gray. And the clouds are gonna come up from the sea. And they're gonna cover the hillside and the wind is gonna be blowing. And then we're just gonna let it happen. And we're gonna crucify her. [Simon] 'Beginning is ending' 'Ending is the start.' 'A circle connecting..' 'Sum of it's parts.' 'This is like that.' 'That is like this.' 'and the same and the same and the same' 'But the journey..' 'The journey between' 'that may well be insane.' [police siren] [officer over megaphone] Look, sir, there's a crowd of people down here who could get hurt if something went wrong. 'Come on down.' 'Come on down now and help us break it up.' [indistinct] 'Let's keep everything cool, okay? Do you hear me?' Look, buddy, you've gotta come down off that pole! 'Don't make it hard on yourself.' Come on down. Come on down now, and help us break it up. [sirens wailing] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] [instrumental music] This is exactly the kind of crap I'm talking about. Why do you think he did it? Don't know, boss. I thought you wouldn't know. Simon, Lee. Lee Simon. 27 wonderland drive. Mill Valley Marin County. '’A couple of fights.' 'Hadn't had a fight in a long while.' [indistinct] Me and my two buddies, Louie and John. And, uh, went to advance in California. We stop waiting for a stop sign. All of a sudden, a guy comes outside and says "Hey, come on, you guys you gonna fight me right now or what?" I said what's wrong with this guy. Crazy or what? Big tall southpaw, about six foot five. He's gotta be nuts, this guy. So I go like, hey, sit down and go back to your car. So then the light changed. When the next block comes, Sacramento and Van Ness and, uh, he did the same thing, he stopped us. Says he wants to buy his car tires. You wanna get with that? He says yeah. You want to fight? So, I got mad, and took my jacket off and said I'll fight him. Lights off, boys. 'Then I says, "Hey, go take a hike, pal.' 'You're gonna get thumped."' Then he grabs me. Then three more come out of the back of that car. I says, "Whoa! You got a rat pack. Are you kiddin'?" I couldn't believe it. I says, "Now we gotta fight for good now." So while Louie's fighting one guy in the corner I'm fighting the guy in the middle of the street. Boom boom boom. Then all of a sudden, the guy I hit runs across the street. Runs behind the telephone and kicks Louie in the ribs. I hear him broke his ribs. I says, "Gee, I can't believe that." So I ran across the street to him with a left hook, boom. - I cut my hand-- - What time is it? - Right now, about 12:05. - Right. Well, you can't talk, I guess. No. Go ahead. This is it. [car tires screeching] What the hell's the matter with you. Why don't you watch where you're going? [knocking on door] You think you could open it? Yes, sir. No problem. [instrumental music] [female #2] Sunshine's real nice. You know matter of fact I wake up every morning with a great smile. You know, a lot of people say "What you smile for in the morning?" You know. But, you know. I say I feel good. 'Cause, you know, I'm living, you know. Wake up in the morning and say, "Wow," you know, whoa. [male #5] It's pretty sad. but I have hopes like the other guy that.. You know, like a baby everybody will wake up some time to reality and.. If you care about people you care about yourself. [female #3] It's hedonistic. I got-I.. Bet you know what I said? [female #4] And the pressures are fantastic. Even if they only come, you know, from in your head. I'm really getting tired of it, you know. I see everything happening and when I was younger I was more idealistic. Well, I talked to three different friends today and that was fun. No. No, nothing special about today. See, I'm an alcoholic and I used to be so terribly sick and terribly depressed all the time. I wouldn't like to go back there but anyway, I spent a week here. And then I went down to LA and on the way to LA I got busted and spent two weeks there. I know what's going on. I wanna know how you feel. Uh, that kind of lifestyle isn't worth it. It's a put-on. [male #6] Some people are high on like, by creating wars, you know. That gets them high, you know. Shooting other people. We all have uh, skulls and insides to our bodies. But we also have the spiritual outside. 'I think there is permanence, there's a psychic permanence.' 'Uh, between two people.' There's a permanence that goes on and on and, uh, you know. You can be separate from that. [pipe organ music] [pipe organ music] [pipe organ music] [male #7] 'You told me to remind you that the press is gonna be here.' Okay, I'm reminded. - Get the feathers. - Okay. 'Yadda yadda yadda..' Yadda yadda yadda.. - Jesus, it's about time. - Sorry. Yadda yadda yadda.. What's your line? Listen, honey, I gotta be outta here pretty soon. Where you been? What do you want, cutie? Okay, roll it. [giggling] [laughing] You nuts or something? [dramatic rock music] Please, stop it. [sobbing] Oh, please...just please.. Clavius. [sobbing] Don't forget that the press is gonna be here in a couple of minutes. [sobbing] I didn't.. Are you okay? As if you cared. I didn't really hurt you, did I? You did. You poked me too hard. Listen to me. You were really good. I-I wanna leave now. 'Now, Clavius, lets get ready for the press.' You sure you wanna go through with this? I have absolutely no reservations. Now, I hope you're ready for this. Why, what do you mean? [chuckles] Well, I've met this Logan before turned out to be quite a freak show. Good. [footsteps] [gunshots] [feedback from microphone] [Logan] 'Can you hear me?' 'Listen, it's wrong. It's all wrong.' It's not working. 'We've got ten minutes of this light left.' 'We've got to get this shot now.' Can you hear me? 'Stop it!' 'Listen, it's all wrong.' 'It's wrong. It is not working.' 'Don't you know what you're doing?' 'We have this light for ten more minutes.' We've got to get this shot now. Do you understand? You're the crucifiers. You're not out for a Sunday morning boat ride. 'You're crucifiers.' Don't you know what you're doing? You, and you're gonna nail her up on that black cross. 'For yourselves, for all mankind.' Do you understand? This is it. You're so terrified, you think you're gonna puke your guts out. That's all because you're wrong. You're so wrong and she's so right. You're gonna nail her up on that black cross and watch her die. And you're gonna be crazy, you're gonna dance around her. Howling, screaming, insanity. That's what I want. I want insanity. [feedback from microphone] Bo.. Boat.. Boat. Boat. Bo.. Boat.. 'Boat.' 'Boat.' 'Try, boat.' 'Boat.' 'Dorothy, try it.' 'Bo..' 'Boat.' Ba.. Ba.. 'You know what I want.' 'You must try.' You can do it. Please. [birds chirping] [birds chirping] [typewriter clacking] [cars revving] [engine revving] [tram bell ringing] [grunting] Are you alright, buddy? [engine revving] Alright, cut the radio and get me to the office. [engine revving] 'Slow down!' Slow down! [tires screeching] Eddie! Eddie! [dramatic music] [tires screeching] Slow down, damn it. What the hell is all this? [tires screeching] [dramatic music] Stop it, you damn fool! 'Eddie, listen to me!' [dramatic music] Why are you doing this? Slow down! Help me! Help me! Help me! Stop! [dramatic music] 'Stop this car.' 'Stop this car, stop.' 'Stop.' [tires screeching] [tires screeching] Why are you trying to kill me? Why are you trying to kill me? I should beat the crap out of you. You'll never catch me. You're crazy. You're crazy! I quit. [chuckling] Why do you hate me so? Why do you hate me so? [engine revving] [chuckling] I'll see you in jail for this, you son of a bitch. [chuckling] [engine revving] [birds chirping] 'Hello, Suzanne.' - 'What's that?' - 'I brought you a gift.' 'But, I don't have electricity.' 'You don't have electricity?' 'Oh.' 'Everybody's got electricity.' [giggling] What's the matter, Jackson? Something's happened to me Suzanne. - What? - I don't know. I called my minister, I didn't know how to explain and she didn't know how to answer. I read a column I wrote and I hated it I hated every word of it. My chauffer tried to kill me or at least tried to scare the hell out of me. 'I don't know which.' I'm confused, I don't like it. You know what I am? I'm a complex, civilized man who has heavy armor that is made of stone. 'I don't want to look in that mirror.' The reflection I see that splits me wide open, it hurts. I'm too old for this now, and too tired. Rocks don't change. 'Your innocence forces me to insight.' 'You are beauty, my dear.' Oh, Jackson. The answer to me is simple. I must stay away from extreme beauty. I must stay away from you and people like you if there are any more. Understand it's because you are so much more real than I. It's nothing that you did. It's just what I do with what you are. [engine revving] [panting] [telephone ringing] My friend Lee made it. I'm glad you like it. [birds chirping] Do you know what it's like out there? I don't know if you do or not. Its so different, from this and you. It's hard to explain. You found your way. The rest of us are still searching. I love this man Lee Simon. He's in pain. I've seen him though. He peeks through in moments.. ...and he's so beautiful. His face actually changes, it gets bright. And his eyes, beautiful and so full of everything. It's only in moments though. Only in moments. It's not fair to bring it all here, is it, Dorothy? You're so beautiful. I wish you could teach us all to smile like that. Tell me.. ...please teach us. [panting] [choking] [gunshot] [instrumental music] Logan. Listen, it's always crazy like this. It's okay, just trust me. [instrumental music] [Jackson] Several years ago I was.. I was driving from Los Angeles to a convention in Palm Springs and, uh I guess I made a wrong turn and I wound up in the middle of nowhere. When I realized that I was lost I stopped the car and got out and I was very angry at the inconvenience but I soon forgot about that. It was quite late and the moon was very bright. And there in every direction as far as my eyes could see the earth stretched out before me. Naked desert country. It made me feel excited and uplifted. Well, I went back into my car and I went back to the convention and left that feeling behind me. But, you know something? That is the exact same feeling I get when I'm with that girl. Now, I don't know why, don't ask me and I don't know how. [male #8] 'Jackson, I believe you sound infatuated.' Oh, come on now, its nothing like that, I told you. 'Well, I just don't understand. What is your problem?' I-I-I-I feel strange today. I am not myself. And I'm saying it to you the best way I know how. 'Instead of me, why don't you try the Lord.' 'He has much better understanding than I have.' 'Let Jesus help you with your problem.' 'Put yourself in his hands, you can't help, but be right. 'The Lord and me love you, Jackson, but we got to run now.' 'Goodbye, Jackson.' 'May god bless your path.'
