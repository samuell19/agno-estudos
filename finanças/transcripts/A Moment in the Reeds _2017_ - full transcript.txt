How was the trip? - Good. In Paris, the train went on strike, and I almost missed the flight. I was lucky. - When did you arrive? Friday I landed in Helsinki. - No call from you. I had work to do. I had to go to the library to pick up texts for the thesis. What texts? I write about this Finnish poet. It is a comparative work. About the gender performativity of Sarkia and Rimbaud. Do not you think you'd be better informed if you would meet the opposite sex? Yes, sure... When do you actually want to do your military service? First I finish my studies, then I will see. But you have to do it! Who knows, maybe I'll be French by then? Do not you think about it that they could send you to Syria? In France, there is no compulsory military service. And hardly any else. Finland is in good company with Russia and North Korea. How is the renovation going? Alone, I'm slow. What about the artisan? Yes, Tamer or Tarek... Some foreigner... From an agency? Where else? I needed someone. Let's get started? The lower ones should be good. For sure? - I think so. That's rotten. - I'll pack it over here. OK. The little one here? - That may work. Give it to me. That is too short. It's good. We need those. How is it in Paris? I think it's good there. Let's see how it goes on after graduation. This is stuck. Where exactly do you live there? - In the Latin Quarter. With a few friends. With a few friends? What... is that how it is for people? Fellow students. Are you... Where are you from? From France. From France... That would be enough. Is there a hammer? No. We'll get that later. Measure and mark. From the edge? - Exactly from edge. Long or short stroke? No matter, the main thing, you know where to saw. Do you recognize that later? And now... the next. You know that you lose a millimeter while sawing? One millimeter? That must be very accurate. - Yes. Did you find the hammer? Why is this taking so long? Why are they here? Does this really have to be now? Do you want to sell her with the house? No idea. These are all Mama's things... Your wedding photo. Leave that. I'll take you to the house afterwards. Yes... Do that. You have to go strong. I agree. Do you really miss mom? Slightly straighter. I'll get another one. Look! I said, over the old mark. You're an inch off. Oh, right. Take that off. - I'll fix it. It's good to be able to do such things as well. Maybe you'll have to renovate yourself someday. That's still good, right? - Yes, it seems so. Right on the mark. Do you see? Yes here. - I agree. Damn, they're sharp... Crap! - Oh no! My finger! - The whole board is over! My finger too. Damn it! We have to change the board. - Do it alone! It was clear that that would overwhelm you! Leevi! Hello. Tareq. Jouko. - I am glad. I'm sorry, I did not find it right away. Did you come here well? I'm sorry, but I can not speak Finnish. At least welcome him. Hello. Leevi. - Hello. Tareq. I am glad. - I am also pleased. Well then... Should we start? My dad definitely tells us what to do. Or? Yes... The here and the... - Okay. Rock. - stones. Stones... - Yes? Stones... - Yes, a kind of way. A way? - Yes, to the jetty. Yes. - Okay. Yes, and this one... All this here... Do you understand? - Everything, yes? OK. Not here. - Okay, just between those bars. The and the here... Petsiä. A kind of transparent paint... Yes, paint. - Yes No problem. Does he know what he should do? - Will we see. And here... The little trees have to... They have to go. - Okay. Not big... Not the big ones. - Okay, sure. And... New... sahapukki. Excuse me? New sahapukki! Does he understand... - You should make a new one. OK. - For sawing. He does not speak a single word Finnish! I can not teach him everything! Damn it... That was good! How can you send me someone like that? He does not speak Finnish! How should such a... He has no idea! Do not worry about my dad. He is always like that. Alright, nothing happened. It has nothing to do with you. He gets angry quickly. It's okay, really. It was nothing. Will you bring more? Yes. You are... Where are you from? From Syria. Bring some momentum! Were you... in Syria at school? I am an architect. You know, I... I built that... this house. All alone. Wow... The construction is very good. Leevi, do not you want to make us coffee? Clear. I'll go then. Timo has called me to come. Where to? - To the office. We should do this alone? Runs well. Sure, that's why I came here. I'll be back in a few hours. Bye. Bye. I found one more. Good. Then we are done faster. - Yes. Have you already repaired many holiday homes? No, that's my first. How long have you been in Finland? Not a year yet. OK. Not yet that long. No, this is my first summer here. Nice. Can you please give me one more? Thank you. And, do you like it here? Yes very. I have never done anything like this before. Look at this. Just do it again with... - Yes, hereby. Yes. OK. Now it is better. This is groundwater. - Yes. My dad loves it. He always says: "That's the best water in the world." From the pure soil of Finland. Yes, it is good. - Yes. Since when are you here? I arrived early today. - Oh. But I've been in Finland since Friday. I was still in Helsinki to get books for my thesis. And, were you successful? Yes, I found some. I write about... My work is about two poets. OK. - One is French, the other Finn. And who are these poets? The Finn is called Kaarlo Sarkia. You certainly do not know him. - No... I do not know him. But the Frenchman is pretty well known. Rimbaud? - Yes, sure. Yes. - Do you know him? Yes, but I have not had the opportunity to read it yet. Yes... Do you have a tip on what to do best? So... His most famous poem is called "The Drunken Ship". OK. - I know, that sounds weird, but... It's about this ship, which is increasingly filled with water. It's running full, as if it's getting drunk. I know it sounds weird, but the ship has that vision of total beauty and ugliness in the world. And do you see the world that way? It sounds like a cliché, but I believe that to be beautiful, also know the ugly. That's obvious. Maybe you can start with it. Do you use the boat for fishing? As you can see, we have not used it for a long time. It is in a really bad condition. When I was little, sometimes we were fishing with it. My dad tried to teach me to fish. I was not really good at it. - Aha. Once I caught a small fish. We threw it back into the lake. I have never been fishing OK. Never? - no. I come from a big city and hardly know the country life. That's like the drunken ship. It immediately gets visions. Do you like the view? Yes, it is beautiful here. It is really beautiful. Sometimes it feels like as if I can not appreciate that. And why is that? No idea. The last time I was here... I just wanted to be somewhere else and get away. But somehow it's different now. The weather is great. Yes, fortunately. I think the winter here is terrible. So terribly gray and dark... The darkness is the worst. The cold does not bother me, but this months-long darkness... I think that's terrible. - Yes. That was really hard. Sorry, I have to answer. - No problem. Yes? Over night? Yes, we did. Yes. Alright. Bye. Great. What? - My father is not coming today. He has a few problems in the company and has to take care of it on the spot. OK. I would like to have a shower. Have a shower? A shower, here? We dont have. There is no water connection here. Jump in the lake. You are joking! - No, jump in! It's not that cold. Definitely not. But fine, I can also turn on the sauna. Have you ever been in a sauna? - no. No? Then you should try this. Is Finland very different from your home country? Well... what should I do with it? At any rate, we do not pull each other out. Also... the people here are very different. They are usually a lot... more detached, not so sociable. It's pretty hard to make friends here. I also think that Finland is incredibly white. Oh yeah. There is virtually no diversity. Some think I do not drink alcohol because I come from the Middle East. The people here are not used to strangers. So you live in Lahti? Yes. Do you live alone? And the rest of your family is in Syria? Yes all. I hope you are doing well. Well... They somehow survive. Do you have the opportunity see you soon? I can not go back. Then I would have to do military service. - Okay. They would send me to the border. And the situation... for Syrians today, with the visa... It's not that easy for her... to travel. Do you think that it... any opportunity for her to come here? Well... I'm not sure if I want them to come here. - Ah okay. And why not? Of course I want to, that they come out there and are safe. But... my family is very conservative. I have not done my military service yet. He is suspended until I finish my studies. Let's see what comes next. But... that is of course something completely different. Yes, I know, but I understand it anyway. Even if there was no war in Syria, I would not go to the army. You have sent me a letter. With a bus ticket. - Really? With the date on which I am to begin my service. I have to write more applications. Yes, please. Of course, my dad wants me to go. He says: "Boys turn into real men." Oh man... Everywhere the same macho mentality. That's so silly. But do you know: If you do not go, you are either Swedish or gay. Let's go to the lake. - Yes. two three! It's warm, I told you! Look, the sky! Cheers. Cheers. I would prefer wine. But good... What else does not exist: father's beer. I'm sorry, monsieur. So you have... no girlfriend? No not true. What do you mean by "not really"? Well... I have only been here for a few months. And I'm focusing right now on my new life here and... that's what's coming. What do you think, How long will you work as a craftsman? You can do much more with your degree. Well... I've already tried to find something better. But... it's really hard because I do not speak the language. I sat around forever. I was really frustrated and just wanted to do something. So either waiters... or this. I just like this one much better. That's closer to my job. Yes, sure. It's nice to have a few projects. Maybe I will save a bit and travel. To travel? - See the world. I would love to go to Paris. Paris? - Yes. I always wanted to go there. That's not a bad choice. Paris is a great city. Yes, I always wanted to go there. If you go someday, say, I can... show you everything. Thank you. That's really nice of you. No problem. I am always happy about visiting friends. I like my neighborhood. Saint-Germain-des-Prés. - Yes I know that. Sartre and Beauvoir have also written there. I was really excited when it was clear that I could live there. I imagined: Just because I live there and walk through the streets... That there is something in the air, that makes me a great writer. Sounds good. Of course it's not that easy. Do we want to listen to music? I do not know if we have something here. I think there were a few records on the shelf. On the shelf? I do not know if we really want to hear that. That's from my parents. - Let's try it. Alright, if you want. - Yes. Oh god, that's what it is? And, do you like it? That sounds really funny. Oh God, that's awful. Oh, come on... Oh God... And what do you mean? - Well... Great Finnish musical. This is our Finnish moment. Do you like that? No. I still remember this song... My parents have in the car... always heard this song, over and over again. That was enough for me. Hey! Nice weather. You were diligent. Yes. Everything's OK with you? Yes everything allright. We have already started to paint here. Yes... Yes... it works... Good? - Yes. Have you got along well? Yes everything allright. So what. If everything is okay, then I'll get something to drink. You know... I have... a small company... A transport company. I drive... wood in the paper mill. But... things are not going so well because people do not read so much newspaper anymore. That's why the paper mill does not need that much paper anymore. Tukki... so wood. I have a truck... and a driver. I thought about it when we... these, these re... Renovation? - Yes, renovation. If we manage that well, I can sell it, this... mökki... Holiday home. - holiday home, and from the money I can new... Stuff... buy for the company, so I... can also transport something other than wood. Yes. Yes... Hopefully you can sell it soon. After the renovation you can take a good price for it. Hopefully. And? Is it good to work as an architect? Yes. Is not that something for you? Yes, sure... He appreciates your work more than mine. Oh no... Unfortunately, it is not so easy to find work as an architect. Especially here, where I can not speak the language. That's really difficult. But now you have a job here. Sure, but... I mean a job that is more of my education as an architect. Does not he like to work? - It's just a stupid job for him. But he will be paid for it. Can you give me the water? - Clear. Here you go. - Thank you. Thank you. Tomorrow will find a... Formula 1 race instead. Do you think Sebastian will win Vettel? I do not know who Sebastian is. - Oh yes? OK. Which sport do you like? Soccer? Sport does not interest me that way. What do you like? I am more interested in art. I really like theater. Alright. Back to work. Let's move on. - Yes. Here we go. Close the door! - Everything OK? Go on. Come here. Come over. Why does it take so long? I found him. - Then that's good. Where did Tareq sleep? On the couch. But there's no bedding there. It's back in the closet. - Oh. He does not seem to live by the Koran. Why? In the kitchen is a bag full of empty beer cans. We had a couple of beers in the sauna, after work. It's good that it's going ahead. The sauna is almost ready. I have to go back. - When will you be back? I do not know yet. - Not today, anyway? -No. Yes, I think we have this under control. Yes, watch. I have to go. - Bye. Sure he will not come back? Do not worry. He is gone. Your eyes are so incredibly deep. I just have to stare at you. And a deep voice. That's really nice. I like your eyes too. I like your beard. Yes? And the hair here too. You kiss very well. The call of death Rough and outrageous Hangs the white gallows rope Throbbing pulse A drop of sweat on his forehead And in the eyes. The look of screaming death The Hand on the Neck ties the rope In the belly the flames of hell The last breath spits red The sky is here A heavy body on the chest The funny hangman did it again At number 16 is the beast at home And I love it That sounds strange. I like the melody. But what does it mean? So... It's about this man. He spends the night with another man. And... he sleeps with him. And although he thinks it may not be good for him, he does it. Because he loves it. Fiction or experience? Experience. I had a pretty... wild time when I was in Paris for the first time. I'm so... freed and emancipated felt. I started, Use dating apps right after my arrival. You can imagine the rest. Yes... that seems familiar. Yes? I felt similar when I came here. OK. At home, I also used dating apps. But I have, for example... never put a photo of my face. Not even when I wanted to meet or tow someone. They always had to live very far away from me, so nobody notices something. Funny how different it is here. I feel so free here. It's good. And where is that? In Germany. And the? This is... Croatia, yes. That's really beautiful. Where is that? That was in Athens, I think. Did you come through all these countries? Yes. How was it on your journey? Well, exciting... But I was scared too. It was anything but easy. Sometimes we had to... dozens of kilometers run. The food was scarce. You feel unwanted, is constantly sent away. It was also... very often demeaning. Some people... take advantage of you. They try to earn from your predicament. That was... awful. I can not imagine how hard it must have been. Real hard. Nice that you're here. Thank you. That's what my mother painted. Yes? It used to always be at home, but... My father must have brought it here. Maybe he could... do not look at it anymore. She died. I'm sorry. Is already something here. I see that she had talent. Was she an artist? She should have been one. So... She was a teacher. But in her mind she was an artist. Sometimes, when I came home from school I listened to old French records. I knew she was painting. Sometimes I painted with her. Then she told me everything about her... favorite painter tells. They lived in Paris, 100 years ago or so. Now I know where the Bohemian comes from. Yes. I always thought that was unfair that I only get on a plane and fly to another place, to be myself, to be accepted and respected. I know this feeling. Have you ever loved? Yes I think so. Maybe twice. OK. Tell me. The first time I was 17. He was older. I probably worked with him on my father's complex. And the other... was as old as me. I first realized how much I loved him when he left me. OK. And what about you? Well, I had... a relationship in Paris. It started just before my mother died. That helped a lot to handle it. But I do not know if he loved me, or if he just wanted to be with somebody for a while. Such a beautiful sunrise. I can not remember that it was ever so beautiful here. What do you remember then? I hated it. I was so busy running away that I... only the ugly and not the beauty could see. That something like this happens here... Good Morning. Tomorrow. But you started early. It's not that early. Leevi, I'm trying to work. OK. What's wrong? No. For sure? Yes, Leevi, sure. We are really late and should give it a go. Oh, come on, do not worry. We have already achieved a lot. But I'm worried, it's my fault when it is not done. I am here to work here. Are you angry with me? No, what should be? I would just like to work here in peace. Okay good. Do you need something from the store? Cigarettes maybe. - Okay. I bring some with. He is too. Excuse me? - It does not exist for a while. OK. Are you... You're Jouko Korhonen's boy. Yes, Leevi. And you're... Pirjo. From the store. Yes... Are you in the summer house? - Yes. Do a little vacation. Father and I are renovating a bit. Renovate... Yes, we do a few... facade work. Father wants to sell it. Selling? - It will not be more... We barely use it for years. Right... You look like your father. Already a real man. As a child, you looked like your mother. Excuse me. Does not matter. Well... What are you doing? You work for sure... I am still studying. Literature. In Helsinki? No, in Paris. Paris? I've been there for almost five years. I should be ready by Christmas. If only I can finally finish my thesis, then I'm almost done. Thesis... Paris... Everyone walks away from here... I could not buy cigarettes. Everything has closed. It's okay, I still have some. Now listen... I'm sorry I was so mean just now. It's just like this: My family is considering coming to Finland with me. Maid mother said if their application for asylum is rejected, they want to get across the sea. You know how dangerous that is, and how many people die daily. At the end of the phone call my mother accused me that I did not take care of her and let her sit. I want you to be here and safe, but I can no longer bear this double life. I just can not do that anymore. I understand that. I just can not... I can not tell you. I do not have the strength for it. One of the reasons why I left, was my dad. If he ever showed up in Paris... I would not have done that. I am also afraid because I like you very much. I also you. I mean, you are beautiful and smart... and I really like being with you. But you live in Paris and I live here. You have your life there, your own dreams. I'm almost done with my studies. Me keeps nothing there. But Leevi... I see you do not belong here. In all respects. You hate this one. But... Maybe you can come to Paris with me? You said you always wanted to go there. Yes, to visit, for a weekend or something, but... that's not so easy for me. Only recently has it worked better for me. I do not have the strength always somewhere to start from zero. Yes but... Paris is not so far away. From time to time I could fly here. We could continue to see each other. Yes and then? You know what? Let's not talk about it now. Do not think about it anymore... Let us enjoy the moment. So... When do you fly back? Next Sunday. I have to start the thesis. I really wanted to do something here, but... it has happened differently. Did I stop you? And if so. What about you? What's up? I have a new project. It's a bit like this one. I can use the money well. I want to visit friends in Berlin. - Nice. I have not seen her forever. I hope to hear something soon about the language course. No idea why it takes forever. Then you can read what I wrote about you. So you wrote something about me? I knew it! Can I read it now? Come on. OK. Crap. - What is? My dad called about ten times. Is he back? I do not know. Let's go back. - Yes, go. This is a normal working day. We had to go to the store shortly. What did you do? Nothing is finished. It is not painted. There is still a lack of color and some boards are still loose. There were a few problems. I should not have hired someone like that. He has no idea about houses. What does that have to do with his origin? Why are you defending him? Incidentally, I'm not blind. And you... You will not get a dime! From an architect! You have no idea! Go back to Syria! We do not need you here. - You are crazy! You can not live here because of people like you! Oh, I'm to blame? How do I stand in the village when you two are having fun here? Are you worried about the villagers, right? You should have thought of Mother and me! Your mother has left! Hey, what are you doing? Do not go, I... I'm so sorry, that will be... I just have to... - You really want me to stay? Would you stay like that, let you put up with it? Just before that, I was always scared. Okay wait. I just pack and come with me. Hey, Leevi! I want to be alone now. You have a lot of problems with your dad. But... - finally get that done. He has problems, not me... I'll leave here and come with you. Hey, Leevi. I see this country differently than you. I have to believe it, I live here now. I'm sorry that this happened. Are you going to Syria now, yes? All you drive away. You blame me for the death of your mother. Do you think... I do not blame myself too?
