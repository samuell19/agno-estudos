Great Freedom No. 7 Jens! Man, where are you? I thought you're ready but you're sitting here looking at the moon? When that bloke plays La Paloma I always have to think of Hannes. You call that whining "play"? I play at least as good as he can whistle. Hannes could play. Jens, could he play? That was like an orchestra when he got going. Hannes' kind of a magical animal, I know... Whatever he does, he can do it in any case better than I... Of course he can, freshwater Harry! Only one thing he could not: stay on board as a sailor. Because he didn't want to, dimwit. 'Cause he didn't want! Hannes is the uncrowned king of the Great Freedom! Someone like that can't hold a candle to him! - Hannes can, if he wants! - He can kiss my... He's got a whole other prospects, eh! - Now how long do I have to wait for you? - Where do you want to go? You're asking questions...! - To the Great Freedom, mate! - To Hannes of course! - Without me then. - Ever heard a thing like that? Seven months he wasn't in Hamburg, and doesn't want to go ashore? You and your Hamburg... guess it's the same bang business as in any other port, be it Frisco, Valparaiso or Shanghai. You oughta come to Cologne! That's where the fun is! Cologne?... Jens - do you know Cologne? Cologne? No. Never heard of. What? Yep... ...think I'll come along and embosom your Hamburg. Speaking of bosoms... I hope you're morally steadfast? Mate, the Hamburg girls...! If any of your Hamburg girls appeals to me, you can call me Kasimir. Well if we were in Cologne now...! See you! Kasimir! Hey... that's Hannes! ...your blonde hair ...dyed black, or maybe red. And when a young stranger is greeting you when passing by and you don't know him, maybe you will remember again when he softly speaks to you: Come, my little darling, please be mine, don't say no! Until tomorrow morning at nine you shall be my only one. If you want I'll be true to you till the evening at half past nine! Link arms with me, we'll go strolling together now ...through the night! All now! On the Reeperbahn at half past midnight whether you've got a girl or not you enjoy yourself, it will sort itself out on the Reeperbahn at half past midnight! One who's never been in a cozy night strolling up and down the Reeperbahn, is a poor wretch, for he hasn't seen my St. Pauli, St. Pauli by night! Before the next riding tour starts a snappy triple fanfare for my friends Fiete Brinkmann, ship's cook - and Jens Peersen - able-bodied seaman of the Padua! And when we come to Hamburg, we know what we will do, - All sing along! we'll buy us one for fifteen pence at the corner of David Street. Hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray, hurray, and when our pay's all blown, we'll go to sea again. Riding is fun! Riding gives pleasure! Jens, Fiete! Come here, come here, girl! Mount! Let's have a drink! Wait a moment... Madam...? - I've spoken with the director of the Hansa Theater... - Fine. - See you later? - Sure. Without? - Sure. - All right. - I'll be waiting in the car outside. Anita! - I've known you for fifteen years! - At least! - And you're looking better each time! - You really think so? Get ready for the next tour! Say, what was that all about in the loge, with the lady? What could have been? Nothing! - Better watch it, chap! - Now don't make a fuss, will you? - Better come out with some good rum! - Some good? Yes, some good! You've gotta be kidding! For two scoundrels as you I spare no expenses! Hannes... Here... But that's... that's our Padua! Yes, I made it for you, Hannes! - We did, we! - We? - Here, read: "from Jens and Fiete". Now what did you do at it? I drank up the bottle! Otherwise you couldn't have put in the ship! Well, Jens? Well, Fiete? How was the trip? Record, eh! 68 days from Spencerport to Cape Lizard! Man alive, eh! That's quite something... Our old Padua went along like some sewing machine. The old man was pretty rough on the tub, eh! At each watch there was at least once "all hands on deck". At the Cape, we didn't get out of our wet rags for four days. Cooking? I couldn't even think of cooking... And the green water stood on deck all the time... Hannes... on this voyage you were missed, man. Where's the rum? Anita, I ordered three rum! Cheers all! Jens... Fiete... come 'ere... Cheers! All ready for the ride! On your mark... ready... Who says "ready"? No one's saying ready! If anyone here says ready, It's we saying ready! Fiete ready? Jens ready? All READY! Say, is that still the same old donkey? - Sure! - Eh, Hannes.... Who's she? - That's Margot. - Never saw her here before! You can't... She's been here for only six weeks. - Cute... - Looks damn feeble. - What, Margot? - No, the ass! Hannes! You're to come to the harbor hospital. - Say, what am I to do there? - It's about your brother... My brother? He can kiss my... He can go jump in a lake! The nurse says he is nearing his end... - Hannes... - What? In that case... Hannes... Well alright... Is the old issue between them still not straightened out? That will never be sorted out, man. Up next is the famous ride on the donkey Bimbo! The management will pay 10 mark to any person who succeeds in riding three times around the arena without bucking off. Kicking, hitting and biting on the part of the rider is not allowed! - I'll ride him. - Don't... - I'll ride him! - Fiete, don't! That 10 marks are for the son of the old Brinkmann! - Fiete, no...! Nice tiles...! Hannes... gotta help me, Hannes. Ah. Again. No. But it's... not for me. I'm finished. Gisa... the girl's... still waiting for me. I wrote... everything down. - ...Address... - No. I've always helped you... I gave you all my savings, so that you could go to naval school, and what did you do with the money? You blew it. And I had to slog on as a plain sailor. And keep on grindind my bones, and for whom? For you! Then I saved again, because I also wanted to go to naval school, yeah... and when I was in Australia with the Padua, you secretly went to my locker, guess you still remember, no? Second drawer bottom left, under the hankies. There you simply stole my money! Then mother fell ill, and you didn't even look after her. Then mother died while I was at sea, and when I came back home other people had buried her. I won't forget that for all my life, With a rascal as you I don't want to have anything to do any more! You ruined me! And because I didn't want to start from the beginning for the third time I did stay on land, where I do not belong at all... with Anita at the Great Freedom. No, man - as long as we're both alive... we no longer have anything... What's with him? I think he's afraid! Gisa H?uptlein... market garden Cashier, please! What do you say now? What's your name anyway? - Jens Peersen... - Jens? Oh, now that's a beautiful name, isn't it? Yes, true enough! Beautiful people have beautiful names! - God, you're so pretty! - When did you sign off, eh? This morning! Smokestack's burning, baby, eh! Jens Peersen's going mighty strong on his chest again! Oh Jens... I really like strong men! 6... 8... 10. Check! Say, Fiete... who told you the trick with Bimbo's tail? Trick? I seee...! That was a trick? Well, thank you very much! Anita... when will be the next ride? Evening, Hannes! Watch out, Admiral! The beautiful love in the harbor the beautiful love at sea just to sleep once in the harbor no one wants to say good-bye The beautiful girls in the harbor they're not true but they're new... Hey... give me a double aquavit. I think you should sing again, Hannes. That's the sixth round without intermission. What about Jan? Did anything happen? Hannes! Here... the sheet anchor at the foredeck is missing! Hannes... - Did anything happen? - Yes! One more... Hannes, you're not going back to sea...? 'Course not - I have to go away for a few days, because of my brother. - You'll come back, will you? - Where else can I go. Where are you going? Are you looking for me? Good morning...! Tcha... Actually, I came to see Miss Gisa H?uptlein. What do you want from my daughter? It's... I come from Hamburg. My name is Kr?ger. - Kr?ger... from Hamburg? - Yes. I see... ...that's you. So you're the one, who Gisa... and you still dare to come here? Now hold your horses... I don't even know your daughter. Oh really... but back then in Bremen when Gisa was on a visit with my sister, there you knew her quite well, no? Mrs. H?uptlein, the one who knew your daughter... After you had your pleasure you suddenly disappeared! and dumped the poor girl - you rascal! Now would you please calm down! The one who knew your daughter was my brother. And what's been wrong between them they better should have sorted out themselves! Jan! I'm just the elder brother. - Good morning. - What about Jan? He sends you his brother, because he's too cowardly to come. He probably needs money again. I dont want to hear or see anything about that whole Kr?ger rabble anymore! - You seem to have a screw loose, eh! - Forget it, it's useless. Now come on, really... What about Jan? My brother... well... he's dead. No... No! Yes. Two days ago... blackwater fever. And a rascal... my brother sure wasn't a rascal, don't you think that. After all everyone can have bad luck in life. Well, and the money, the money you gave him, he gave it to me to return it to you. Because I promised my brother that I will look after you. But I think that won't be necessary now, as you have such a nice home here... "Home", Mr. Kr?ger - - If you knew... - Yes? It's hell, from morning to night... once one had tough luck in a small town. But do you... have a child from my brother? - No, it's not that. - Ah, I already thought... Guess you've been lucky. But in any case, it would be fine if you'd get out of here for a while! Where can I go? Where you can go? I take you with me... to Hamburg! - To Hamburg? - Yeah, I know a lot of people there, we'll soon find an employment for you. Yes, girl - you can count on me! We Kr?gers, we sure ain't no rabble! Finally getting some peace... finally no more accusations! That would be fine... But I can't, Mr. Kr?ger. Can't do that to mother. She hasn't got it easy either, since father's dead. Fine - you can still think it over! I'm going back later this evening - if you want to find me sometime: Hannes Kr?ger, Hamburg, Great Freedom will do. Well then, cheers... Thank you, Mr. Kr?ger! And... Poor Girl! Does the affair with that rascal from Bremen never end? You shouldn't bad-mouth Jan, mother... He's dead and I once was very fond of him. Oh, I probably should be thankful that he got people gossiping over you. You should only hear what people are saying. Only good thing is that your father didn'd live to see this. Leave father out of this. He'd understand me. Your father? He would have chased you out of the house! Our daughter, a sailor sweetheart! - One has to be ashamed in front of the people! - You're ashamed of me? I see... I didn't know that, mother... I didn't believe that strangers are more important to you than your child. Gisa! Kid! Well, girl? Where's the journey going? - To Hamburg! - Bravo. So... now come on in, girl. Guess I first show you my mansion. Now this, that's my parlor. Over there, that's my parents, and beneath the banjo... there's a picture of captain J?rs of the Padua. - Ah! There's a parrot! Does he talk? He better not! And here's my bunk... It already has seen many a storm! And over there's the caboose! - Caboose? Is that... - No, girl, that's the kitchen. - What you mean, is half a floor downstairs. - I see! You're still standing there, kid - make yourself comfortable! I just have to wash my hands. So... - Are you going away again, Mr. Kr?ger? - Sure, I have to go to my joint! But tomorrow morning I'll be back. So... well. Gisa, what's the matter with you? - Nothing. - That's fine. I already thought, because it's all a bit unfamiliar to you... but I think you will get accustomed to me. - Yes. I first have to get acustomed to you, too... Gisa. But we'll have to find another name for you. Gisa... no Hamburger would know what that means. - Gisa... comes from Gisela. - Yes... Padua! Too bad it's no name for a girl. But it has to start with a 'P'. - Why? Everything that starts with a 'P' brings me good luck. Padua, Pinnersberg, St. Pauli, Police... How about... Paloma. La Paloma. La Paloma? If it sounds Greek to you: it's Spanish! It means "the white dove". Oh, but I'm no white dove! But you're some little birdie too, eh! And when a white dove has lost its way and comes on board, the sailors know they will soon be in the harbor. And such a small animal a sailor won't harm. Well then cheers... Paloma. Holy moly! We haven't got anything to eat! - Won't you get anything? - Well I do, but you! - Oh, it doesn't matter... - Now come here... Paloma. Here's five mark... go downstairs our house... there's a pub - Billbr?u... give my regards to Mrs. B?rgel, that's the innkeeper... tell her to give you something yummy for eats. Couldn't I eat a bite in your bar? At the Hippodrom? That's where the wicked pirates are! That's no place for small kids! My first, he was a sailor who was tattooed on his chest. He wore ocean blue trousers and I was so terribly shy. He took my hand and he promised to be faithful, and gave me his word to take no other for me... and next morning he went on board. The first time it still hurts you still think you will never get over it. But by and by, and bit by bit you get used to it! For parting he gave me two florins and he said to me so tenderly Love, you have to be a bit patient, I come back to you in a year. He wrote me one more letter from Hong Kong, how fine it is there, and that he would still love me... and I never saw him again. The first time it still hurts you still think you will never get over it. But by and by, and bit by bit you get used to it. - Another round, Mr. Scholz? - Think we can handle one more, Mrs. B?rgel. WHO DARES WINS There's something wrong with that box! You just haven't got the knack of it! - What will it be, Miss? - Mr. Kr?ger sends me... he'd like to have a little bit to eat. I see... Mr. Kr?ger wants something to eat again. So choose something... for Mr. Kr?ger. - Hey... dimwit... - Sorry... Owww! The box is fantastic! ... ...in order. You brought me good luck, little miss. May I, out of thankfulness... oops... invite you for a drink? - Thanks. - Don't say "Thanks" unless you enjoyed it! - But I didn't want any beer... - But I. Cheers! Better take it along, Miss, Mr. Kr?ger's used to it. - What do I owe you? - Nevermind. I put it on Kr?ger's tab. Good Evening. Good Evening...! See you! She's nice... ain't she? She's a floosie! Who knows where Kr?ger picked her up! Cashier! You cut quite a dash, eh! Want to ruin our little Anita's whole nightclub? - Have you been true to me? - As true as you've been to me! We'll have to talk about that later! Well, and you two lunatics? - Is it still the great love? - Guess it is, Hannes! Leave a little bit over of that skinny herring! Don't listen to Hannes... you're my one and only! Well then Anita - a round of k?mmel and beer! Is there someone? I already thought I came here for nothing again. I brought the sea chest and the stuff. If you'd sign here... I put everything inside. It's from the harbor hospital. Bye. - Today I'll go home with you. - But Jens... I already told you, it's impossible. - Today I'll go home with you... - No! Now hold still, will you!. Fine... all right... The issue is over, over and done. I'm not dependent on you?! Man... you're juiced! Or do you perhaps think I'm dependent on you? Jens - now be reasonable! One should have hair.... Whether you think that I'm dependent on you? If you don't keep quiet I'll go. Then I'll go with you. And he's... not dependent on her! - So send the girl to me tomorrow... - That's fine. - ...and if she's busy and proper... - Wellenkamp... I'd put my shirt on Lisa. Allow me to introduce - Kr?ger. Rosamunde... Riding is fun! Whether you think that I'm dependent on you... I'm not dependent on you. I thought you'll stay? Oh, well.. eh... I can't right now... - Still have an appointment later. - Tonight? Who is it? Well, with... with the... It's business. I know that kind of business. You know shit... babe! Rosamunde... give me your heart, be my dear... - They don't give me no more k?mmel! - Go home, you've got enough! Enough...? Enough!? Do you think I'm dependent on you? Closing time! The customer is liable to prosecution as well! Are you cold, eh? Jacko, quiet! Good morning! - Can I have a few tabs? - Work already over? "Already"...? I'm back from the night shift! I'm dog-tired, looking forward to my bed! - Morning... - What's this? Mr. Kr?ger? Up so early? I return the mug... and then I'd like to take a little bit upstairs for breakfast. Think I'll risk one more, eh? Wiseguy... - ...and a bar of raspberry chocolate. - I see...! Why "I see"? It's not what you think. The lady who brought the beer yesterday is in fact... a distant relative of mine, is this information enough? Does she also work at the Hippodrom? No, she does not work at the Hippodrom, but if you really want to know, she's working as a saleswoman for my friend Wellenkamp in his store, that's all there is! Many thanks! Good afternoon! - I want a buscherump, Miss. - Oh... yes. - Don't you understand me? - No. Don't you have a buscherump? - A what, please? - A buscherump, Miss! A b... Just a moment, yes? Mr. Wellenkamp? - How can I help you, please? - I don't want no buscherump. - I want a tie. - A tie? - Yes. Maybe you want to help yourself? Mr. Wellenkamp! What will it be, sailor? - Do you have a buscherump? - We have. - That's fine. How about that one perhaps? Well... looks really cute! - Don't you recognize me? - No. Or perhaps you take Pepita - matches with everything. But I need one who only matches me. Sorry, I'm afraid I can't help you with that - that's all we have in ties. - Who's talking of ties? - Me. Oh... well then... let's see... all right? - And how do you like that one? - Well... guess it's a matter of taste. What do you think... honestly? - Awful. - That's right! I take it. 3 mark 85? You're spending way too much money for knick-knacks. You better should put something away early enough. One has to put up with the loss. Don't make fun of an elderly woman who means well for you. "Elderly woman"? I didn't hear that, Mrs. Kaasbohm. With your figure? You're still crisp and as fresh as a daisy. You've got no ethical earnestness at all, Mr. Scholz. Earnestness I've got indeed, Mrs. Kaasbohm, but no time. It's pretty... but as you already have four ties? - I don't want to wear it. - Why then did you buy it? - To exchange it. - To exchange it? - Yes! No. No no no no. - That one doesn't fit either. - For what suit do you want the tie? For my good Sunday afternoon promenading suit of course. - How does it look like? - Great! Head to toe! - I mean, what color? Well, it hasn't got a real color... - it's more like... grey. - What kind of grey? Some... greyish grey. - Light or dark? - Me? Always light. - So, wine-red! - No, not wine... beer! Very funny. I meant the suit. Well, it isn't wine-red. It's light grey. Yes I know... But to a wine-red... To a light grey suit fits only a wine-red tie. That's a matter of taste. That's too dark. The suit ain't that light. 4 mark 20...! - And that? - That's too light! Then I have an excellent suggestion for you: - You best come by with the suit yourself. - No, that won't work! I'm wearing the suit only on Sunday, and on Sunday you're closed! But now let me make a suggestion: - On Sunday you come to me! - What?! Well, I meant we could meet on Sunday sometime! Together we could go to Sagebiel's, out at Blankenese, and then I could show you my new suit in motion, eh? - How about it? - I think you should better go home now. - But I've still got so much time! - But I don't. So, as agreed, next Sunday afternoon I'll be waiting before your house. That's typical Hamburg crap weather... and it won't get any better today. It doesn't matter, Hannes. Today of all days, when I wanted to show you the harbor... What happened to the curtains, eh? - Are they new? - Yes, they're new. Well I... And the tablecloth... haven't seen it before either! - That's new, too! - Say, did you buy all this? Yes - do you like it? - Paloma, where did you get the money? - I had saved a bit... You must be a bit batty, girl! Spending your little dough for me? No way! But you bought the bed for me. But that's a different matter! You couldn't sleep on the sofa huddled like a little doggie forever! - And the bed was dirt cheap. - The cloth was really cheap, too. - And I sewed it myself. - Downstairs at Mrs. B?rgel's? No, at the Wellenkamps, at the store. Mrs. Wellenkamp lent me her sewing machine, as we don't have one. You get along quite well with Carl and his wife, eh? - Oh yes. And how about the customers? How do you get on with the guys? Well, they're a bit fresh at times... but I can deal with them. Do your parents also live here? They're long dead.... Father remained on sea, and then mother also didn't live much longer. - Were you more children at home? - No. Except me only little Jan. You Kr?gers were all seamen, right? Tcha... guess it has to be... So you're actually the only one who didn't go to sea? What the... Now there's a thing! - What gave you that idea? - Well I thought you're a musician? - Musician? - Well, or an entertainer or something... I'm a sailor, dammit! - Yes I know... - I'm... ...you perform in a sailor costume, but I thought... A sailor's what I am, goddammit, I'm a sailor, all my rags are still here, over there! And if I wanted to sign up I could sign up tomorrow, but... I don't want to! But I couldn't have guessed that, Hannes! "Entertainer"... that's a fine taradiddle... For 18 years I've been to sea - I can prove it anytime! Where do you think I got that jacket, at the fish market? Here... here's all my papers! It's all in it, where I've been... Seamen's muster book. Here, Hannes Kr?ger. First voyage as deckhand, as ship's boy. Bark Elisabeth from Hamburg to Valparaiso, and back to Glasgow. And here, ordinary seaman. Full-rigged ship Borkholm, a Norwegian. From Rotterdamn to Seaguard and back to Bordeaux. And here from Bremen to... Frisco. And now all the trips as able-bodied seaman on the Padua. From Hamburg to Port Victorioa und back and so on and so on and so on... And all without any complaints - take away that crap! And here's still all my stuff, all the things I've... Well, here... last voyage... my sailing gear... here... my boots... a knife... - What's that, it's full of moths! - Too bad about the fine buscherump... - That's a buscherump? - And what's that... oh... - What's that? - Huh? - What is it? - Oh, that's, uh... - Let me see! - That's just... that's a few... that's... cartographic... postcards... specialties. Ohh... It's beautiful! - For what bride did you bring it along? - Oh... no particular... - Would you like to have it? - But I really cannot accept this! Are these real corals? Sure! Straight from the South Seas! No, I can't forget you, girl... brown girl from Samoa land! No, I can't forget you, girl... brown girl from Samoa land... Has already seen a good part of the world, the old accordion... - Is that difficult? - No... not if you can. Wanna try? Come here... So... In here, and here, leave the fingers and thumbs outside. Now just play... Bravo bravo! What's the name of the song? - Show me again correctly, Hannes... - Come here... So, let go... so, out, here, and over there... You dance quite well, girl! My longing carries me away into the blue distance... Why actually didn't you stay on sea, Hannes? You don't understand that, girl. I'm sorry, Hannes. I didn't want to hurt you. Please play something cheerful...! - No I can't - have to go to my joint! - But you've got another hour! Not today, today I have to be there earlier. - What are you doing tonight? - I still have to darn a lot... Yeah...? Say... do you sometimes listen to the radio? - Yes, on and off... - Well then do so today too. Why? Anything special today? Not really... It's just... tonight I will perform something on the radio. In our program "On the Reeperbahn at half past midnight, a tour of St. Pauli" we've now arrived at the Hippodrom at the Great Freedom, the venue known to all seafaring people around the world, where the sailor finds relaxation after a long journey and hard work. Now Hannes Kr?ger, the singing sailor, enters the podium above the arena. The noise fades, and now it resounds, the old tune, well-known on all seas, La Paloma. A wind from the south draws me out to the sea! My love, don't be sad even though parting hurts. My heart goes aboard and onward the journey goes. Your pain will go by and the reunion will be fine! My longing carries me away into the blue distance. Below me the sea and above me night and stars. Ahead of me the world, carried by the wind of life, don't cry my dear, those tears, they're all in vain. La Paloma ohe - once it has to be over! Only memories of hours of love will still remain on shore. My bride is the sea, only to her I can be faithful. When the storm wind sings its song I'm called by... At that weather you had to wear the good gray suit? Great Freedom's happiness! How blue is the sea, how big can be the skies! High up from the crow's nest I look far into the world. If I only knew what's the matter with Hannes! Yes... he sings so different today! Forward I set my view, So... entirely different! for no sailor must look back. Cape Horn is at lee side, we now have to put trust in God. Something's wrong! Sailor, take care, for even, as if a greeting of peace... Yes, that's your own fault... You just put up with far too much from him! Look at how I deal with Jens... he does what I want, not vice versa. For you that's something quite different ... you do not love Jens! Sooner or later the bell tolls for each of us. La Paloma ohe - once it all will be over! Once the sea will take us, and the sea returns none uf us. Sailor's bride is the sea, only to her he can be faithful When the storm wind sings its song I'm called by... Great Freedom's happiness! Come on sailors, ohe! La Paloma, farewell! - What are you looking for, Hannes? - Where did you hide away the Padua? - The Padua? - Yes, my gift from Jens and Fiete... the ship in a bottle! There it is... Why do you hide it, Anita? If I don't want to stay here, then I won't stay here anyway. What's the matter with you anyway, Hannes? For days you're so... different. In the long run this makes me crazy, every day the same racket in this dive, always acting the fool... Hannes Kr?ger, the singing sailor, yeah, shit... what actually am I here, I'm a better entertainer clown, that's what I am! Hannes, what makes you think like that all of a sudden? You always wanted to be your own master! - own... own master! - But that's what you are! - Ah, yeah? You no longer have to slave on sea in all weathers for others You have everything you need, your food, to drink, you have money... ...you've got me... There's still other things. I see... ...that other is probably an other! Ah... I tell you, once you drift rudderless you will soon be stranded. And no emergency tug will get you back on course. But what's that gloomy brooding, for a guy as you! The Great Freedom has worn me out, finished, I'm a wreck! You're crazy! Talking like that may be excusable for someone like me, for whom the Great Pilot can come on board every day now... but you, you still can sail clear! "Sail clear"... that's quite easy to say... I've become a stinkin' landlubber, I'm already tied up ashore far too close! Then cut the cables, kid, before it is too late! Or you will end up like me... Back to sea... just now... when I'm for the first time... Yeah - I am! But then you don't have to go back to sea! Buy yourselves a barge and do harbor tours! - A barge? - Yes! A barge... He's what? He is sick ? Yes, he's sick. - The ass is sick? - Now that's a fine joint... The guests get beaten up, the entertainer disappears, and the main attraction is sick. When I think of Cologne... Hi Werner! Willem, what about it? Come along to Vierlanden on Sunday? Sunday? No! For Sunday I have better plans! Mrs. B?rgel told me to come down to the barge stand to my friend Puhlmann. Even the weather plays along today! - Where are we going? - I'll show you the best place on the Elbe river. We'll travel down to Blankenese with the green steamer. For me and my girl is the best in the world when we're going up the Elbe on a green steamboat... - Maybe we could go to Sagebiel, go dancing? - How do you know Sagebiel? Lately some cheeky guy in the store said he wanted to take me there. Good that I wasn't around! Puhlmann! Where's the fire? Can't you help me out of the dilemma for a moment? Konrad let me down and now I don't have a barge guide for the Germania. Couldn't you do at least one tour? On this occasion I could show you the harbor - what do you think? That's fine by me, Hannes - Sagebiel won't run away! I'm coming! Me too! Ahead of us is the Kaiserspeicher... The clock you see up there is no clock... that's a water-level indicator... and the fat round ball you see on top of the tower, now that's the clock! That's the time ball, or as we say in Hamburg, the shit ball. That's the clock of the sailor. You can't carry it around in your pocket. Now ain't this something... Over there, ladies, is the biggest powder factory in all of Germany. So we better not get too close, eh? That's Dr. Oetker's baking powder factory! Damned critters... yeah... peep peep! Yes ladies and gentlemen, these are the perils of seafaring! It can't be helped... So how do you like my new suit? So entirely without a tie it doesn't look like much of course but... The steamer in front over there is just unloading. - Is it on fire? - Of course not, Miss... if it were on fire it couldn't unload! It unloads Jamaica rum... With me it's quite the opposite: I've got a terrible thirst and nothing to quench it! - Did you say something? - No. You said "No"! Terrific! I already thought you lost your voice! - Can you also say "Yes"? - You're pretty cheeky! Oh I know... my acquaintances always say that I'm as cheeky as the seagulls at Lombard Bridge. And now our enchanted glance goes to... ...the limit! That beats everything! I mean, this is the highlight of our harbor tour... What you will see now is the sailing ship harbour. Here a spectacular sight meets our eyes. This is the last sailing ship based in Hamburg, the four masted barque Padua of the shipping company F. Laeisz. On this proud ship I myself did travel for many a year, no, for many decades as a sailor! - He's lying! - Barmbeck landlubber, bugger off! The last trip from Australia to Hamburg, the Padua went in the record time of 68... days ... Will you next Sunday again have an appointment with your distant relative? Probably! In any case, next Sunday afternoon at 3 I'll be waiting at your door again. Without tie? Perhaps the gentlemen back there would also deign to listen? I don't want to blather my yap to frinches here for nothing! Hey hey hey hey hey...! Over there at Pinnersberg is the most important building of Hamburg... that's where I live. Over there's the wharf of Blohm & Voss! The biggest German ships are built there. Every real Hamburger knows the song of the workers of Blohm & Voss: We're Hamburg kettle beaters we're working over there at Blohm 'n Voss merry as larks and always proper we chew tobacco and have dreadful thirst. On Sunday dressed up in our glad rags with a true girl by our side as perfect gentleman in every hall you always find a swarm of us! A jacket and a... Hold your horses, we're no choral society, eh! Now wait, pal... Would you please change from starboard to portside for a moment? I'll do a little turn now and then... then you can have another look at the marvelous harbor panorama! - How do you know the song so well? - I'm working at Blohn & Voss! - What - you're not a sailor? - Me? No! That's not for me. Gisa! Come over here, eh! Next Sunday you're not going to wear the good grey suit again! Even more so! Next Sunday I'll go dancing, at Sagebiel's! - Do you have a new bride? - Not yet, Mrs. Kaasbohm, not yet! But next Sunday! Next Sunday for sure, but this Sunday it's impossible! I was so looking forward to Sagebiel - I wasn't out dancing for so long. Sagebiel won't run away. I have a meeting today, that's very important for me, and perhaps not only for me... for litte Paloma... Cheers! What's the matter? It's our last Sunday and you ask us to come to Puhlmann? I rather wanted to see what Margot's doing and if she has no other plans have a little farewell celebration with her! I'm doing a test drive and I want you to take a look at the barge - let's go! - Hey, where are you? - You want to buy the barge? Perhaps...! I don't believe it! He's going to stay ashore?! - You really dance terrific! - Always depends on the man, how he leads! - I think we go together just great. - You think so? Yes. When I have you in my arm your height is according to regulations. - Is that necessary? - Yes, that's necessary. What's that? What... Shall we make it cackle? Looks like you can't go past any slot machine... - It's a pity about the money. - Yes, Mrs. Kaasbohm says that too. Now come... - May I? - Thank you! - Who is Mrs. Kaasbohm? - Mrs. Kaasbohm, that's my landlady. Don't you want to get to know her? No? - He still hasn't brought the ice? - It's always mighty busy here on Sunday. I guess you're here every Sunday? No. Just once in a while. - Why don't we drink a glass together? - Better not. I get tipsy too easily. Don't worry... I'll take you (Du) home. - "You (Du)"? - Right... I knew it all the time, we forgot something... We have to catch up on this right away - to drink to close friendship. You (Sie) better stick with "Mrs. Gisa", and I with Mr... What's your (Du)... What's your (Sie) name, anyway? See?... that's what happens! So what's it to be? Du or Sie? You (Sie) can do as you (Du) please. Now... my name's Georg Wilhelm Scholz. And I'm Gisela Marie Sophie H?uptlein. Is that necessary? But that's the main point! Think about it calmly and let me know. About the price we will surely come to an agreement. All right, Fritz! Hello... well, guys? Day after tomorrow the Padua goes to sea again. Have you signed on already? - Tcha, it has to go on... - Well... now that the ass is sick... - Poor Margot. - When will you kick off? At 7. Say, Hannes... There's something the matter with you. It sticks out a mile! - What's the girl's name? - What girl? Oh, come on - when a fellow as you lets down his pal at the Hippodrom - and still doesn't go to sea... - and drives 'round the habor in a launch... There's for sure some long-haired female behind it! Oh now don't talk such muddled nonsense. Eh, Hannes - clear deck: You want to marry, right? Maybe... yes... if she wants me... - What... you didn't ask her yet? - No... This time it's all much different. Who... who is it? Do we know her? No, she's from out of town! When is she coming? "Coming"... she already lives with me! Man eh.... He's a sly old dog, eh? No, not what you think, wham-bam, thank you ma'am, free concert on the City Hall market... Paloma, she's much different... - What's the girl's name? - Well, Gisa! But you just said "Paloma"... You need something to wash your ears, Jens! How... does Gisa look like? - Is she pretty? - Sure...! And homely and busy and accurate and... and all... and a respectable girl, too. I didn't believe something like that still existed. Boy oh boy oh boy... - Tcha, in that case... - Pity, isn't it? Pity, that we now... won't get to know your Paloma! - Why? - Day after tomorrow we'll be already back at sea... - Wanna see her? - Sure! - Yes, man! - Here goes! Come along! - Yeah! Go ahead! But first wipe your kicks! Gisa! I bring visitors! Don't be shy! Gisa! Sit down! Gisa! Where are you, girl? Gisa! Aren't you here? Well... Oh... She's probably away for a moment... "Dear Hannes -" That's for you only... "The meal's in the caboose on the tray. Since you didn't come back I went for a walk with a friend." "How about Sagebiel? I'm waiting downstairs - Willem without tie" - What are you blabbering? - That's on the other side. White dove... gone! Sagebiel... Bill please! Shall we go? Yes. - Waiter, the bill please... - Colleague coming up! Bill please! Well... You...? Is it allowed...? Hannes...! No! Come sit down. - I didn't ask you! - Waiter, the bill please! - I was about to leave... - What did the gentlemen have? - Well we had... - What did you have? - One cake... What's at this table is on me! Perhaps the gentlemen settle this first. Hello, gentlemen, I still get 6 mark 20! Now come along... Gisa - if you need me: I live at Steckelh?rn 3. - How do you know that bloke anyway? - From the store. - Ah! - And he's not a bloke but a very decent person. - A windbag he is! Oh, you've already met more often? - No! - Yeah? And last Sunday at the barge it was just pure coincidence! As for my part for sure! - Don't tell me lies, girl! - Stop yelling! Not everybody needs to hear this! They're already talking about us anyway! They should better care about their own shit! What's between us is no one else's business! You didn' even turn off the radio! You seem to have been in a great hurry! What the... - There you are, Hannes! - What are you doing here? I was caught in the rain nearby... Luckily, I had the keys with me. G'day, Miss! God, you're drenched! Well that's Miss H?uptlein, a distant relative of mine. - And this is... - Anita Schr?der is my name. Yeah... that's my boss. One might also say so... And now get changed quickly! Or you'll catch a cold! Can't have that with my entertainer! - I'll make us a nice coffee. - But I can do that! Never mind, Miss, after all I'm here at home. Jens told me various things - for how long has this been going with her? Gisa? That was the bride of my brother! Ah, and now you took her over - stays in the family, eh? Get the hell out of here, babe, eh! The first time it still hurts... you still think you will never get over it... Where are my grey stockings? I darned them and put them in your wardrobe. ...you get used to it! - Put on stockings, honey! - Yes! Now, now! He's also one you have take as he is. - Are you with him for a long time? - I'm in Hamburg for only a month. In the beginning he's always very likable. Later it will sort itself out, unfortunately. You have a nice figure... But sailors are hard to keep. Hannes doesn't want to have anything more to do with the sea. Dogs, that bark a lot... one day he'll sign on again anyway. I know the guys. Or do you perhaps think he'll marry you? You think because he didn't marry you? Me, marrying such a bloke? Hannes is not a bloke. He's a decent person... a very decent person. He knows exactly what he's doing. Just like me. Your water's boiling... how much hotter do you want it? Earlier... on the stairs, I guess I was a bit... a bit loud towards you... Paloma? "A bit" is good... You have to understand this, girl... I have my reasons for it. And now all the more, since I know, that you... Help me with my buttons please, will you? Now I really have to say: The apartment is in immaculate good shape. New tableware, new curtains, and the tablecloth's also new to me. But as you now live here permanently. And I just dropped by for short chat. But it was nice anyway, Hannes, no? Now let's talk about something else! Just leave it to draw a little bit more. Have you ever heared our Hannes sing? - Yes, on the radio. - God, on the radio... that's nothing. You have to hear him at the Hippodrom, you will not recognize him! He does not want me to go there. But why not, Hannes, my venue is not a dive?! I also have very good guests, they all come because of Hannes. - Especially the ladies. - Now stop talking such rubbish! Oh come on, Hannes... the Consul's wife for example! She's there only because of you... in fact she's totally crazy about him. She wants to take him to the Hansa Theater by all means. Will we now have coffee or not? I don't want no coffee, Mrs. Kassbohm! You don't want any coffee, you don't want to eat, probably didn't work out with the new bride, eh? - Leave me alone! I have to go! - At that weather? Do you want to ruin the blue suit just as that one? - What are you up to? - Have to kick someone out of his suit! The first time it still hurts, you still think you will never get over it, but by and by, and bit by bit Gimme the trumpet! you get used to it! - Here he's in his element! - He looks totally changed. I tell you, Hannes belongs to the Great Freedom and nowhere else. Her first, he was a sailor who was tattooed on his chest. Over there, that's the Consul's wife. He wore ocean blue trousers and she was so terribly shy. - Evening! - Evening, Fiete! - Ah, a new one? - That's Miss Gisa. Oh, that's you? Brinkmann... Fiete Brinkmann is my name... Jens and me, we're old friends of Hannes! Jens - what do you think of her? Kill 'er... just kill 'er! - Whom? - Over there! - What's your name? - Hein Olsen. Hein? Oh, now that's a beautiful name, isn't it? Tcha! When did you sign off, eh? If he gets intimate I'll kill him! After Hannes has finished I will show you the ass ride! - Ass ride? Are here any asses? - More than enough. - Where's Bimbo? - In his stable. Can't walk. - Too bad, isn't it? - He still can't walk? He needs a kick in the ass! To be faithful, he said, I can try it, though I've never been faithful before. If it's a boy, call him Johnny, if it's a girl, call her Mary. He did not come to the wedding, at the baptism, he was not there so one day she took another - Oh, I see... and now Johnny calls the other Daddy... Don't laugh, it happens in the best families! All sing along! Ballet! The first time it still hurts Why don't you say hello? Could be inconvenient for your bloke. - What's the matter? - Leave me alone! Hannes! That does it! Excuse me, I didn't mean you! Get out of here, this is no place for you any more, okay? But what... what's that to you? I mean... Sorry, but I didn't mean you! Don't touch me, okay? That ape! Don't touch me! - We'll talk later! - You bet! Too bad you're mother will not recognize you! All mouth and no trousers! 'Cause your nose will sit on the back of your neck! And your nose... flies from your face! Police! Come along, gentlemen! Tearing off my bow-tie, eh? When did you sign off? Wait a minute! Allleeee... ...let them have it! What happened, Kr?ger? - Internal family celebration, officer... - Yeah... Tcha... better take care that it doesn't become a private function! Will you finally leave the girl alone? Your bitch can get lost, pal... who wants a floosie of the Great Feedom! Ah you... you bumpkin! Are you asleep, Gisa? No... If you just hadn't come to the Hippodrom tonight... I have no idea why suddenly there was such a wild clobbering under way. But perhaps it all had to be... now I know at least where I'm at with that guy. It's easy to drag a respectable girl through the mud... - What did he? - He thinks you're one of the streets! No...! "A floosie of the Great Freedom" he said. You don't have to be upset about what such an idiot says, it doesn't matter to you. What's that strange guy to you anyway, girl... you've got me! The last few days I already wanted to talk to you about it... I'm leaving the Great Freedom, in the long run that's no life. With Anita, that's not was it used to be, and the other women... it comes and goes, the way it is, after all ... after all one's a man. The Consul's wife... she wanted to get me to the Hansa Theater by all means, but... it's better that way. And if you hadn't come I would've gone back to sea anyway, it's still more powerful than one would think. Then comes the death of my brother... and then you... and then everything is different. "Sail clear" said the Admiral, Gisa... I will buy the barge, you can count on that... and then you will see how light and blue the sky will be... and then... we put my stuff and your stuff together and then getting married... There's a nice saying on merchant ships: Fine weather and a good trip... tomorrow again... [ Hannes Kr?ger Harbor Tours ] On the Reeperbahn at half past midnight... Hansa Theater! Hansa Theater! Hansa Theater! Hansa Theater! Hansa Theater! Hansa Theater! Come to sea again! Stay with me! You will not be a Mate! Sail clear! Come to sea again! Stay with me! You will be no Mate! Sail clear! - Come to sea...! - Stay...! - Sail clear...! Hannes! Hannes! Have no fear, Paloma... I'll stay with you! Paloma... 3...! Steckelh?rn 3! Paloma... Paloma! Steckelh?rn 3! Steckelh?rn 3! Paloma... Steckelh?rn 3! What's the matter, Hannes? Nothing... nothing at all... I was just dreaming... Go back to sleep, Gisa! Everything will be... all right... Eh, Jens... one thing I can tell you, man... Our Hannes is lost for seafaring. What love can do to an man... I'm glad we're at sea again tomorrow. Hey Jens, Fiete, it's almost 7 and you're not yet ready! - I'll stay on board. - You're both mad. I want to stay in Hamburg forever. Hamburg is the most beautiful city of the world, not even Cologne can compete. I'm sick and tired of Hamburg. Owww.... Come, go ahead, get in! and put it down there... so... You... you couldn't find any higher place to live? You better be glad that I'm no lighthouse keeper! What's going on here? Anyone's birthday? Don't be so inquisitive, Mrs. B?rgel... Come here... here's 50 mark... - There's nothing wrong in asking, no? - Now don't stand around here... better go to the kitchen, Gisa will be here any moment! Well good night, Mr. Wellenkamp, I will unpack the new buscherumps tomorrow, all right? It's all right, girl, there's no hurry. But you better go now - for sure he's already waiting! For me no one is waiting... Say, Mr. Wellenkamp... where's that... Steckelh?rnstreet? A young lady is here... she wants to see you. - What young lady? - I don't know her. She hasn't been here before. - Don't you want to put on at least a little bit? - Why? What are you doing here? I have to tell you something. Yes? Please? You're lucky with the ladies, Bel Ami... so lucky with the ladies, Bel Ami... you're not handsome, but you've got charme... you're not smart... you're no hero... So... just a man... who appeals... You fall in love every day anew you kiss them all and never remain faithful... but the woman who loves you... Huh? How can one marry in house with such narrow doors? Bel Ami, Bel Ami... Bel Ami... yep! Yes... And I really thought you had something going with him. Then I wouldn't have come - no? No. I guess you haven't had anything to eat yet, right? Then... then I'll... wait a moment. Mrs. Kaasbohm? Oh couldn't we have some more tea, please, Mother Kaasbohm? - Is this the new bride, from Sunday? - Do you like her? Beats me! Young man... Lil' one... Hello... hello, stay here, eh! Carl Wellenkamp, The House for the Sailor... No, Hannes, she left here at seven prompt. Now what could have happened. She's no small child anymore. She probably has to do some shopping... ...I'm sure! She asked me about the Steckelh?rn! What's the matter, Mr. Kr?ger? Nothing... Nothing at all... WHO DARES WINS When did it start for you? Well... wait... - Actually, already at the Bajazzo... - What Bajazzo? The gambling machine! - At Mrs. B?rgel, downstairs at your place! - Yes... Don't you remember... back then... when you shoved me? I couldn't stand you then... you were so cheeky! And when did it start for you? - Also at a slot machine... - But you just said... No - not at Mrs. B?rgel's... - At Blankenese... - I see... Never let it be said that slot machines were no good. Say that again...! But I can say it only once... - But I want to hear it once more... - But I won't say it! [ Your own peaceful home is a piece of paradise ] That's pretty! Where did you get the necklace? It's from... from the South Sea. Ah... - I'll find me a room tomorrow. - But nearby, okay? I'm afraid of tomorrow anyway. Why that? Do you think I don't know you anymore tomorrow? - No. No... it's just because of... Maybe it will hurt him. Why? You didn't have anything going with him! No, it's not that... But he was so different in the last few days... Sometimes I almost had the feeling... I had that feeling from the start. - He never said anything, but... - See? Then you don't need to have a bad conscience. - I just feel so ungrateful. - But why...? You looked after for him all those weeks! Seems to be mighty hard for you, eh? Don't talk such nonsense... Wait... I've got something for you! - You always wanted to exchange your tie! - Too late! That suit is ruined. Do you perhaps think I'm dependent on her? Whether you think that I'm dependent on her, eh? I'm not dependent on her! Bye. - Where do you want to go? - To Margot. - Come here! Come in! What use to me is a pretty girl when others take a walk in there Get out of here, you...! and kiss away all of her beauty and kiss away all of her... Get out! What's the matter with you? Leave me alone... - What's with Hannes? - Shut up! There... Engagement rings... Hannes... Never mind... You have to get out of here. Don't you want to join up with us again? But aren't you... already complete? - No, we're not! - No? - Well, Karl! from Cologne... He'd like to stay here, he likes Hamburg a lot, - if he finds a replacement. - All of a sudden? - How come? - Oh... ...old story. Ah... because of a woman. No... - No. - The captain has a telephone, I could get it straight quickly! Back to sea... At sea again... They celebrate a wedding... but I don't care at all... because I am a sailor... Good evening, dad! who does not... Jens! What's wrong with you? I cannot forget Margot. Have you lost your marbles, eh? You're crying... because of a woman? Let her go! 'Cause you are a sailor... who does not know of faith... Hey, tomorrow... you will be on sea again and then everything will look different! You... always keep sailing... under the heaven so hot... And when you're standing up there on the yard again, and the wind howls in your ears up there, eh! then you'll forget everything... Jens, don't you remember what our captain back then wrote into our fleet calendar for christmas? "One wouldn't believe what a man can forget... ...if he's a man"? My bride is the sea... And when you come home again after such a long voyage, then perhaps you no longer know how she looked like... or... ...you find another. If you want. What use is the crown to the emperor? What use is his money to the sailor? 'cause there can't be anything better than in Hamburg for the money a girl! Jens, sing along, eh! 'cause there can't be anything better than in Hamburg for the money a girl! Two, three - Hammonia... Hammonia! oh how glorious are you standing there. City of Hamburg, at the Elbe's meadows - how stately are you... - Hannes, here's the kitbag... - Mrs. B?rgel's got the keys to your place. - Fine. What the... - Hannes goes to sea again? - Sure, dude! On our Padua! - In place of Karl! The captain agreed! - Hannes! Sure, Anita... once it has to be again... now don't cry my girl, come... come, give me a kiss... you were... sure enough not too bad... Well... ...so let's go. ...and you my love will stay here... Fine weather... and a good trip, lad! Translation + subtitles: Kurosuke@Karagarga v1a - 2010-05-10
