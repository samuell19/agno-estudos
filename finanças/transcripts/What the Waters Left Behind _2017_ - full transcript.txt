It's 1:00 PM in Argentina. This is a live broadcast from our national Naval Observatory. 4:00 PM. According to the most recent information, slmost 700 people... ...and 264 homes have been evacuated. The water is expected to rise another 12 to 15 inches... ...which means the number of evacuees could exceed a thousand people. This has been the worst flood ever to hit Argentina. Who remembers Epecu?n? A huge disaster, forgotten by most. But they do. They remember. Once it was their home, but now there are only ruins left. Epecu?n looks like a scene from a movie. A horror movie. But that's nothing. Did you hear what happened to me? I was driving down Route 25 on my way from Columbia to Venezuela. It was blazing hot. Then, suddenly, I see two chicks hitch hiking. So I hit the brakes. They were your type, Vasco. Two backpackers, a blonde and a brunette. Real good looking. So I ask where they're going. 'Venezuela.' So I let them get in. The blonde's carrying this weird package. Anyway, I'm not backing out now. So off we go. Two miles later, I see them all over each other. So I'm like, 'this is looking good for me.' Then we reach the border... ...and they're like 'We're off to the bathroom.' They take their backpacks with them. And I'm just there. A long row of cars behind me. The line is moving, and they're not coming back. Near the border post I see right there where you're sitting, Vasco... ...that package. So I'm thinking I'm screwed. I look up, and see a guy with a dog. He asks for my papers. Then he's asking 'What's that? 'Not a clue, that ain't mine.' So he wants me to get out. And I see to dog going crazy. He's running towards this old lady ina skirt and he rips it off. There's 40 bags of coke under there. Amazing, right? So this other guy tells me to move on... ...and I'm in Venezuela. I got the hell out of there. Never saw those girls again. - And the package? That's reckless. I just don't know who I'm working with. Yeah, very funny. That's a good one. Can you turn down the music? We're trying to shoot a documentary. No shit... Okay, Carla... What do you remember from before the flood? Not much, I was very young. I just have some vague images. Like what? I remember the lakeside resort. I was there a lot with my mother. I never wanted to go into the lake because I couldn't swim... ...but then one day I did. And I stayed afloat. There was so much salt in the water that you couldn't sink. A salt water lake? Yes, that's what made Epecu?n so unique. Are you filiming this, Erica? - Don't worry, you look great on camera. I'm impressed. Beautiful. What do you remember of that night? I was in my room, I was asleep... ...and I woke to the sound of a siren... ...and I heard people screaming. There was a lot of screaming. When I got up, the water was up to my knees. My mother came in in a panic and took me into her arms. I remember she kept saying 'We need to go, we need to go'. When we left, she locked the door so nothing would get stolen. She really believed we'd be coming back. I'm sorry, are we nearly done? I need to go to the bathroom. Could you please not ask any stupid questions? Watch it, will you? We're filming. OPEN Thanks honey. Nice place you got here. Wanna join me in the bathroom, girls? - Okay. Look, I get this shot, and one like that... ...and then that ass in close-up. That's one fine ass. Too bad she only scissors. Scissoring, Vasco. Girl on girl. Go shoot the area. Birds, crickets... Let's go. Hello. Looks like no one's here. Hello? Coming. How are you? Hello, how are you? Can I help you? - Can I use your bathroom? Through that door. The one at the end of the hall. Over there. - Thank you. You're not from around here, are you? - We're from the capital. Ah, the capital... I thought as much. Nasty place. So, what can I do? No one's coming? Show me, Vasco. That's a nice watch. Is there a GPS in there? - Yes. It tracks idiots. Look, it's saying there's a huge idiot nearby. Good one. I have empanadas with meat. - No, thank you, madam. What? You don't want anything? You need to buy something, sweetie. I'm not here to just clean up a tourist's shit. So you better start thinking about how much you want to eat. From the capital, right? I had a cousin there, Olga. She came back here every summer. She had sex with Juancito once... ...and then Pedrito the other summer... ...and then some married guy. Do you know what happened to the poor child? They found her body in the lake. Poor Olga. Poor Olga. And here she thought she knew everything... Oh girl... ...you look so much like Olga. It's incredible. Really. She looks like Olga. Well, how much are you going to eat? What are you doing? What did you lose? What are you looking for? We're looking for the boss. - In the grease pit? No... Let's see. Boss? Boss? You know there's no one there. Do you think I'm stupid? What did you steal? - Nothing, sir. Honestly. I'm just joking with you. What are you looking for? - Gas. Gas? - We need gas. I'll fix you something and I'll be right with you. - Thank you. What are you doing here? Come on, they're waiting for us. Girls, that bathroom was so gross. Just wait until you see the empanadas... Can you clean the windshield? It's so dirty. If you have the time. What's your problem, asshole? Fine, it's over. Don't make a fuss. What is it? - Nothing. Vicky, you've got a new admirer. Gross. - Don't you get it, I don't like men. Fine, shall we? Yes, it's not far now. Don't you think you should pay me? Sorry, I forgot. How much? - For you... ...with that face - 100o pesos. - What? Listen, fatso. First you steal from my shop, then you want me to clean your windshield. Are you now going to tell me what I can charge you? Why don't you stay out of my workshop? I'll go out with the girls. Come on, just pay him. Pay him, Nachito. We'll work this out. And find some shadow. Here's your empenadas, you old hag. Check out this location. This will be one hell of a documentary. Not bad at all. Alright, let's start rolling. Get everything ready. We don't have much time. Let's get our stuff, Vasco. Relax, we're here. You alright? - Yes. You are? - That was my grandmother's house. Are we good to go? - Come on guys, let's get going. Set up the equipment and get started. This was my bedroom. Over there the dining room... ...and here was the kitchen. No, let's stop for a moment, Carla. I don't know, Diego, but this one doesn't feel right for me. Not enough dramatic pause, climax, tension... - You think? Maybe you're right. What do you think? - Maybe some more. Go for it. You know what, Carla? You seem tense... a bit stiff. Just relax, take it easy. Visualize your memories and let them speak. Shall we try again? Action. When the water came, ...there were people who refused to leave. Some stayed until the water... ...was up to their waist. Firefighters had to take them by force... ...because that was the only way. Good, very good. Great! Great, that's it, Carla. That's the right note. Brilliant. This documentary has begun. This is what I'm looking for, right. Let's take a break. - Way to go, Vasco. Sure, but let's stay on track. We got this, very good. Great, this is it. That was real good. Thanks. - Just let me know if you need something else. Alright. You're such an asshole. It turned out beautiful. It did? - Yes, you were fabulous. Where's Vicky? - Not sure, Vasco. She's your girl. Look, there she is. Come over here. Where were you? - I wanted to get some shots of the ruins. We could have gone together. - We'll go later. Oh, later. Later when? When? Hey, swetheart. What is it? Hi all. Hello, Vasco. What are you doing with my phone? Here's your phone. You were supposed to take some photos. You're so unprofessional. Unbelievable. And this? What's going on now? - What is this? What's wrong with this piece of crap? Nacho, didn't you say you took this thing across the whole of Central America? Knock it off with the negativity. What? I say something and just like that I'm all negative? You don';t know the meaning of teamwork. Great, now what the hell is this? Damnit, fuck this. - Nacho, great job, dumbass. Damnit... I didn't wanna use this thing to begin with. Stop whining and help me, man. Look where we are. Why are you just standing there? - Do you guys smell that? It's leaking gas. The fuel line must have ruptured. What? What fuel line? - The one with the gasoline in it, Vasco. I'm no mechanic, I'm a director. - Get out of here. Where am I supposed to go? - Out of my way. I don't believe this. Get over here, Nacho. I can fix the fuel line, but we'll need more gas. We need a tow truck. If we fix the fuel line, all we need is gas. Someone's coming. What are you folks doing here? - The van broke down. It just quit on us. I think it's the fuel line. Let's see... What did you say happened to this? - I don't know. This didn't break, it was cut. What do you mean? - Someone cut it. I can take you to a gas station, that thing needs to be replaced. We can go together, Vasco. No, not you. You come with me. - Fine, I'll go. Erica, you get some shots of the cemetery while we're away. Touch my girl and I'll rip your head off. Carla, how far is the cemetery? - About 20 minutes on foot. Shall we? - Yeah. let me grab the camera. Get me my bag? - I'm staying with the van. Diego, I'll wait for Vasco too. - Whatever you want. Do you still have any friends from Epecu?n? - Some. Not many. Do you still see them? - No, not really. If you're uncomfortable, just tell me. - I'm fine. Just let me know if I'm crossing a line. - I will. We'll just change the subject. - I'm alright. Yes? - It's strange being here... I can see it's doing something to you. A lot of memories coming back? Was it hard, moving somewhere new? Is your family alright? They're fine. And no, it wasn't that hard. Do you want some? - Yes please, it's very hot. Thanks. - You've got a moustache. What? Carla? Are we almost there? It's hot isn't it? Would you like some water? - Yes. I didn't know you could draw this well. - Thanks. It's not done yet. But it's turning out alright. What a heat. It's the humidity that gets to me. We're making a documentary about Epecu?n. We want to take it to Berlin next year. We've got a lot of work to do though. Don't touch. Leave it there. Watch your step. Carla, where are we? Did we start yet? - Yes. Whenever you're ready. This was the cemetery, the cemetery of Epecu?n... Can we do that again? Just relax, forget the camera. Tell your story. When the water reached the graves... ...people were desperately trying to save the remains of their loved ones. Others just saw an opportunity. Divers wre asking for money to find the bodies. And then they brought you the first thing they found. I remember a neighbour asking them to go find her three brothers... ...who had been buried together. They brought her four bodies. She had to bury them together. And so she brought flowers to someone she never even knew. Do you want me to go on? - No, I'm good. We're done. Take a break. How does she look? - Beautiful. Stunning. Yes, I know. What happened? Damnit. - I got bitten by a snake. Give me that scarf. It bit me... - Relax. Get the gear. We need to get back to the van. Christ, it hurts. Can you walk? Come on. - Yes. We'll go easy. That's good. Vicky, I don't want to insult you, but whatever did you see in Vasco? Why are you asking? - You could get any guy you want. But you ended up with him. I don't know. He buys me stuff. He takes me on trips... He's smart. I admire him. And he promised me a part in his next movie. He's a good guy. 'He's a good guy.' I'll be right back. Kiki? Kiki? Kiki? Where are you hiding? Come on, Kiki. Come on honey. Where are you? Nacho, have you seen Kiki? - No, not for awhile now. Dumb animal. What's that? Stay here. Come on, just hold on. Come on, Carla. There's the van. Hold on now. Erica, help me. Nacho? Vasco? Where the hell are they? - Hang on. Come on. Wait, careful. - Take her arm. Nacho? Vasco? Vasco, where are you? Vasco, where are you? God damnit, Nacho. No, we have to go now, Erica. Can you hear me, Erica? Look. - What? Easy, Carla. What is it? Hold this. Easy. it's going to be alright. What did you want to show me? Did you see that? Rewind that, will you. That must be the guys. It must be. Keep calm. - Did you hear that? Stay calm, Erica. It's nothing, nothing at all. Just calm down. Easy. Easy. I'll go take a look. - Diego. Don't. Stay here. Don't go. - Relax, it's going to be fine. You'll feel better. I'll go take a look. Get me out, Diego. - I can't, I can't do it. Don't leave me here, Diego. Come on kid, we have to get out of here. Let's go. A documentary, right? You wanted to do a documentary. Well... Let me introduce my family. This is my little brother. My older brother. I'm the oldest now. But he used to be the oldesat. A puppy. A cute puppy. This was his puppy... And this is my nephew. My little nephew. Look, this is... ...this is Tito's corner. It's where Tito plays. And this is my stuff. No one gets to touch it. The camera's getting this, right? No one touches my stuff. So, you wanted to make a documentary. Do you want to make a documentary? Do you want to make a documentary? Guess what it's going to be called? 'Chimango's lessons.' Don't scream. Be quiet. Lesson one: 'Metal wire. ' Lie still, you slut. Quiet. Listen to me, please. Just listen... Lesson two: 'Typical Argentinian cuts.' Please, listen... Do you know how many fuckboys like you... ...I've nailed in the ditch? Are you cold? Calm neighborhood from my past on a dreery evening I stand freezing on the corner I return, older, the years have changed me and they covered my head with grey snow I travelled with my pain and wandering as dreamers do I understood my life's malady each kiss drowned in a glass it's always the women that take away your dreams defeated I return home to the house of my parents everything here brings back memories to my mind I left when I was 20 the foolishness of youth and the lack of wise council in the house there's a cruel silence and when I knock the old servant greets me as a stranger how I have changed, that only when I spoke the old man saw who I was I found only my mother I called to her from the door and she looked at me with those eyes eyes that were clouded by tears as if saying 'where have you been?' never shall I leave again, I will live by her side in the warmth of this other life only a mother forgives, that's the only truth everything else is a lie defeated I return home to the house of my parents everything here brings back memories to my mind I left when I was 20 the foolishness of youth and the lack of wise council in the house there's a cruel silence and when I knock the old servant greets me as a stranger how I have changed, that only when I spoke the old man saw who I was The freak is in love.

Alright, no problem. What is it, sweetie? - Water... Water? You want water? Well, we'll give you water. We don't want any dissatisfied customers. We want you to come back again. We depend on you for our food. Give her some water, you idiot. Do you want some water too? Then you'll have some. You won't be left wanting. And do you know what we'll do next? We'll have an empanada, you look weak. You should eat something. here. Open wide, sweetie. Come one. Here comes the airplane... Come one, sweetie, open your mouth. Won't you have something to eat?

Leave him alone. Don't hurt him! He doesn't know what he's doing. He's just doing what my grandmother tells him to. Leave him alone. Your grandmother? Your grandmother? You let them kill us all. You don't understand. We lost everything. Everything was gone, and no one came to help us. Nobody came. They left us to die in oblivion. - And so you just kill us? There are things worse than death... Let him go. Let him go I said. Carla... Forgive me. Where are you going? Epecu?n. With this rocking boat, we pass over a cemetery... ...that has been buried itself under 12 feet of water... ...for the past seven years. The caskets were floating around and washed ashore here on the banks. What exactly happened in 1985? They water took us by surprise. We had no time to do anything. We're passing through the town of Epecu?n. Look at the state of it. It's been like this since 1985. The water will never go away. We see that the water keeps rising, and has already claimed a large number... ...of the buriel vaults of the cemetery... Or rather, of what once was the cemetery of Carhu?. There is a strong current. There's a strong wind from the south east blowing across the city of Carhu?.
