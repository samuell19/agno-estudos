Cenk! Come on! The team is waiting for you. Wear this. Bravo, guys! Go for it! Victory! One hundred and sixty, one hundred and eighty… Thanks. Victory! Fifty, one hundred… - One hundred and seventy… - One hundred and eighty… Good night! - You played great. - Thanks. Thanks, man. You saved us! - You're really good. - Thank you. PHARMACY Sub Zero! - Finally found you. - Excuse me? I haven't seen anyone play Galio like you do. The match that you just won… by replacing someone on the team. My name is Ada. Look, I'm not trying to stress you out, but if I could figure out you'd taken somebody's place, someone else could too. What do you want? A cut of my earnings? No. What about becoming a pro-gamer? Not interested. A player at your level will have to join a pro team eventually. I'm still not interested. Sub Zero! What did he say? So you finally find him after chasing him for so long and his answer is no? She fell asleep waiting for you. I did some overtime. Cenk, I don't want you to play games anymore. - Did you get the medicine? - I got it. - Your brother's here, baby. - Brother! My little peanut! Now that you've seen your brother, it's time for bed! - But, Mom, aren't we going to play LOL? - Ceren… Come on, off to bed. I promise I'll come home early tomorrow. I'll play and you can watch. - Promise? - Promise. CHAMPIONS THREE YEARS IN A ROW. KOZMOS IS READY FOR ANOTHER SEASON. SPECIAL REPORT: HOTTEST TRANSFER OF THE SEASON. Victory! - Thanks. - No, thank you. You saved our asses. We were going to be eliminated. Cheers. Hey, by the way, do you play… for a pro-team? GRAND TOURNAMENT PRIZE, ONE MILLION TURKISH LIRA - Good night, Mr. Arif. - Good night. Take care! Sub Zero! Do you have any idea how much we lost because of you? A lot of people were relying on that game. Do you understand? We lost a lot of money. You should have played better then. Hold his hands. What the hell's going on? If I catch you playing in someone else's place again, no one will save your fingers. Cenk. Are you okay? Who were they? I don't know, it was too dark. - Cenk! - It's okay. Cenk… I understand it's what you want to do, but you can't put yourself at risk because of it. It's just gaming. What's risky about it? Well, this is an exception. Let me see that cut. Mr. Arif called the other day. He's concerned. - It's none of his business. - He's just worried about you. What are you hiding there? What is it? Show me. Take off your t-shirt. Do it, Cenk! Cenk! Look, Cenk. You can't go on like this. You need to find a real job. What changed your mind? I think it's time that I became a pro. Okay. Don't expect to make that much at the start. If the team does well, you might start earning more. What is he saying? What is he saying? Ada might already think that you're a star, but you haven't proven yourself to me yet. We can go through your contract later - if you accept - I accept. Qualification matches are in two days. - Will you be ready? - I will. What's the name of the team? The Odd Five. You'll understand when you meet the others. - What a painting! A real work of art! - Yes. This is Aslan. Dozer. - Greetings, homie. - Hello. Come this way. JJ, this is Cenk. What? Didn't we talk about this? No music when you're talking to someone. - Okay, bro. Welcome. - Thank you. Come. He understands some Turkish, but barely. He's quite the shark though, so be careful. Right, this is Naz. - Hello. - Hello. Come on! Don't tell me you've never seen a girl gamer before. - No, I... - Don't worry. You're not the first. - Welcome to the team. - Thank you. There is one more person. Batu. Our team captain. Five kills! Wow! They've announced the new transfers. - Wait! - What? - Isn't that the Sub Zero we know? - Who's Sub Zero? The guy who works here. Cenk. The quiet kid. What? If that loser is in a team, we could play in the pro league too. You wish! Cenk's the best player around here. Say what? Who is the best player here? Can. Hello. You haven't answered my question. Cenk is. Sub Zero. Mid lane of The Odd Five. Is that so? - Didn't The Odd Five disband? - They were disbanded. Their mid lane ditched them. So they were stuffed. It wouldn't make any difference, even if they got Faker. Easy, boy. What's your name? İnanç. Hangar İnanç? Guess who we're playing against. An enemy has been slain! Good morning. - What? - Get up. That's my spot. That's yours. Sorry. I had no idea. I installed the game on your PC and did all the necessary updates. What you should have done in the first place. Nobody told me anything. So, are you going to move or what? Don't forget your coffee. Be careful. The mouse is on the left, the keyboard on the right. Double kill! Don't worry about him. He's actually not that bad. You're new, so… He's just behaving like a dog would, you know. He's marking his territory, I get it. Ace! You're really good! How come you've never played for a team before? We might have a chance in the Grand Tournament with you. Grand Tournament? Yes! One million in prize money. - One million? - Forget about the one million. Just focus on qualifying for now. Don't worry, young Padawan. I will teach you everything you need to know. Hey, Ada! Ada, you got to see Cenk play Galio. I need to see my brother, enjoy the game. All right. Sorry. Ceren. I'll be back soon. You're not upset with me, are you? The qualifier's tomorrow. It's my first professional match. Wish me luck. - You promised we could play together. - Next time we will. What's that? I promise. Crank it down a little will you? Focus on the match. I'll follow you down. Cenk, hold on a sec. - How are you? - I'm good. Do you remember what I told you when you first joined the team? About proving yourself? Here's your chance. Go get 'em. Go on. Rüzgar Uysal, who we know as RoyalFlush, and his team, The Odd Five, are about to play their first official match after their recent mid lane transfer. Will The Odd Five be able to overcome their long-term misfortunes? We shall see. But are they ready to face Kozmos? - Captain Janavar is still number one… - Here we go. …on all national LP rankings. He's also named among the best players in Europe. But my instincts are telling me that we should be open to surprises, too. I've learned not to trust those instincts of yours too much. Even after selection and bans, it's hard to confidently predict the result. - Speaking of selections and bans… - Zero-Six. …the first match is about to start. The first game between Kozmos and The Odd Five… - Guys! - …ls about to begin. Victory! No surprises here! Kozmos has once again shown that they're the best in Turkey. The Odd Five have a long way to go until they're ready to compete against an opponent of this standard. Batu! Why didn't anyone ask my opinion about who we recruited? - Batu! - I'm the captain, aren't I? You have to accept that you're responsible for this too. They weren't ready for that opponent. And you weren't ready to coach the team. - Is that so? - Yes. What are you suggesting, Ms. Ada? - Should you be the coach? - No. - But maybe your former teammates... - No way. Forget it. Özer? Rüzgar. You didn't answer any of my calls. Is everything okay? What do you want? Hey. Do you remember the first computer we built? ASUS Rampage X58 92. It's an antique now. Besides, I built that computer with Tufan, you didn't know jack shit about computers. We won our first tournament with that computer. - Arif took us to dinner. - Arif took us to din… - Tufan insisted we get some booze. - And Arda kept whining. Look, Özer… I've put a new team together. The players are good, but we need a coach. Someone who's been at the top before. - So why are you here? - Özer… I can't leave this place. I have work to do. Yeah, you're right. It must be hard to leave all this. - Look, you've got your answer - I didn't mean it like that. Look, if you accept the job, you'll get a salary. In addition, you'll get a cut from all the tournaments. It sounds nice, but… I don't need money. See you. How did I get stuck with him? I swear, he's driving me crazy. Dude, move your leg. Don't you have a home to go to? - Nope. - What is nope? - Batu! - What? His family is thousands of miles away. Don't upset him by talking like that. Okay, then he can stay with you for a bit. Yeah, yeah. My parents are liberal, but not that liberal. Stop looking in the cupboards. Stop making a mess. He's just a child. You're the child! Oh, God! He's talking back to me! I talked with Ada. She's going to arrange a place for all of us. I can't stand it anymore! Are you listening to Hey! Douglas? JJ was killing me with his stupid folk songs. - This was our compromise. - Nice. Let's hang up. I'll call you later. Dude, I've told you a million times! They aren't potato chips! You can't eat cornflakes like chips! Are you still angry with me? Come here. Come closer. I want to tell you something. Brother, stop! It's okay. Take a breath. Take a breath. It's okay. Okay. Are you all right? - Yes. - Look at me. - It's over now. Do you feel better? - I do. Brother… Are you going away again? Probably. I want to win the Grand Tournament. Don't you want to see me win? Come here. - I'll accept your offer on one condition. - Yeah. We follow our old team's routine. Exactly like it was before. Consider it done. And we'll need a big place where the team can live together. Five friends walk into an abandoned house and… The fat, funny one always survives, right? All right, guys… I don't know how much Rüzgar and Ada told you, but you are no longer the team that you were. I watched your game from last week. You sucked. If we didn't have a limited amount of time I would send you to train with bots. Or I would tell you to delete the game and start again with Tetris. However, since we have only a few months to prepare, the only thing that can save us is shock therapy. It's time to forget everything you know. Who does he think he is? If you don't like it, Batu, you can go back to the university league where you were found. When Rüzgar and I played together, this was our team house. We lived and practiced here. We're going to stick with tradition and follow the same program. That means we start the day early. You'll follow my orders. This is the strategy room. Game analysis and the discussion of tactics will happen in this room. Let's continue. - Batu, no! - That's my spot! Enough! I decide where you guys sit! It's cold. It is a bit colder than the rest of the house. Twenty degrees. Why 20? The arenas you will be playing in are kept at this temperature. It's important your body gets used to this temperature. If the body doesn't feel at home, it panics. Follow me. Breakfast, lunch and dinner will be served here. I don't want to see any food scraps anywhere else in the house. In particular, if I see any crumbs in your keyboards, or greasy mice, you will be punished. Madame Adile handled the housework around here during our team's time here and helped Rüzgar's family before that. You will not hear her or see her. But she will see and hear everything. The gym! You will work out using light weights, without straining yourself. If you injure yourself, you can't compete in the tournament. This is the green room. You could also call it the Vitamin D room. You will be inside most of the time so your vitamin D levels will go down. You'll come here every day and sunbathe for ten minutes. I should have brought my bikini. - Who would want to see you in a bikini? - Me! I'll put a bikini on for you if you want to see someone in one so bad! As you can see, this is the living room. Everything except the piano, bookshelf and chess set is off limits. Especially the TV! What's this room? You'll find out what that room is when you're ready. - Are you behaving while I'm not around? - I am. - Promise me you won't upset Mom. - I promise. - How much do you love me? - This much! I'm joking. This much! All right, I need to go now. Big kiss, my little peanut. - Okay. See you! - See you. Bye. I hope I'm not interrupting. - Were you talking to your girlfriend? - What? No. My sister. Cenk, I know everything is new for you. The mansion, team-mates, coach. - If you have trouble getting used to... - It's okay. I got this. Okay. See you around. See you around? Get up! Let's begin! Our main goal is to clear the way to the opposing team's Nexus. We will be neither too aggressive nor too passive. This is what I mean when I say, "becoming a team". Every move you make, you have to be in sync with each other. No one can act on their own. If one member can set the right tempo and we follow him or her, we will reach our goal. Challenging group matches lie ahead. You will go beyond your limits. Sometimes you'll have to play 14 or 15 matches a day. JJ? Would you like to put some sunscreen on my back? J… J… Throw it in the trash. All of it. Everybody leave the game. All of it goes in the trash. Gather around the table. Batu's gameplay is very aggressive. Naz cannot catch up with you. Aslan is too defensive. JJ is a loose cannon. The team is very disorganized. What we need is something in the middle. Let Cenk set the pace. There's no difference between a tournament match and any other match. Same champions, same strategies. The main difference is here. None of you have ever been on the big stage before. Trust me, it's not like watching tournament videos on YouTube. You'll understand what I mean once you get there. To play well under pressure, you must learn how to silence your mind. An empty mind is a free mind. If you let the chaos of the outside world disrupt your inner peace, you'll lose. If you receive bad news and you let it affect your game, you'll lose. If you get upset because you are behind by a few games, you'll lose. But if you can stick to the game plan, under the stage lights when 10,000 people are cheering your name… you'll win. - Great! Continue pushing on the mid lane. - Okay, got it! What are you doing? Get out! Out! You… - One! - Two! - Three! - Four! - Five! - The Odd Five! JJ… - They must be so tasty. - They look yummy… I've been waiting for this moment for so long. - I can't wait any longer. - Let's dig in, JJ! Cenk! What are you doing awake? - What are you doing here? - Nothing! Please don't say anything to Özer. I'm fed up of eating broccoli and cabbage all the time! I need to have meat, real meat. - So what are we eating then? - We? Well, we ordered a lot but I don't know if there's enough. - Thank you, JJ. - You're welcome. What are you doing? Never mind. It looks like there's enough for all of us. Come closer. I'm teaching JJ Turkish. SIMPLE PAST TENSE - Read it. - I'm eating. Good. Don't talk while you're eating. Mr. Özer. Don't you think you're a little too tough on the kids? Madame Adile. You were here with us back then. You know what we had to endure. I remember, of course I do. I remember how you all used to talk smack about the coach. I remember you sneaking out of the mansion with Mr. Rüzgar. - Also, with Mr. Arda... - Madame Adile. - Good night. - Good night. Brother. The groups have been picked. We're in Group A. Which group is Özer's team in? The Odd Five? I dunno. I didn't check. Then check. Why? Who cares about that team? Do not underestimate any opponent, Can. You saw what happened last month. We kicked their ass. That was before Özer. Rest assured that if you meet them again, and you will, you'll find them a completely different team. What was that loser's name? Six Zero or something? He worked at Hangar for a year and I still don't know his name. - What's your obsession with Özer any... - Can! Check those groups. Batu! - Sit down. - Bro... Sit down. Don't worry about Batu. He'll calm down after a while. The decision has been made. You're the captain now, whether you like it or not. I don't know if I'm ready. You have to be ready. For the team. You have the potential to take this team to the very top. If you can realize that potential, you can become the best. How do you know that? Because I used to be the best. I couldn't stay there long. But you could. You could do it. Why me and not you? Because I didn't have anyone around me telling me what to do and what not to do. THE ODD FIVE Hello, everyone! We're coming to you live from the Grand Tournament qualifiers. GRAND TOURNAMENT We're with Group A for the first game of the day. The tournament favorites Kozmos versus Sparta McRubes. McRubes will be one of the toughest teams to beat this year. You're right. But Kozmos have won three of the four finals they've played here. And the game has started! Kozmos haven't backed down and they've taken first blood. Kozmos have got the first inhibitor. They've got the second one, too. Their route to the Nexus is wide open! VICTORY - And Kozmos is victorious! - Yes! As expected, they've played an incredible game! What's going on? Are we at a funeral? Come here! Do we really have to do this? Cameras and... - Don't be grumpy now, come on. - Come on. - One! - Two! - Three! - Four! - Five! - The Odd Five! The second game we'll be watching is from Group B. The game between The Odd Five and Duality is about to start. The Odd Five will be playing their first game after their "reorganization." We were surprised to hear Özer's name. He's been away from gaming for a while. The Odd Five took complete control of the map with the sixth tower. An amazing "flash" from Sub Zero. Mikasa and Dozer are right behind him. Phenom is hitting Nexus. Duality has no chance of defending this! And The Odd Five are the winners! Looks like The Odd Five built their strategy around their mid lane, Sub Zero. This is reminiscent of the play style of Özer's old team. - The Odd Five are so good, man! - I agree. They really are good! - She skates better than I did at that age. - Of course she does! Mommy, let's stay a little longer. But, honey, what did we talk about? We don't want you to get tired. - Right, Cenk? - Yep. Mommy, can I do it by myself? Okay, okay. Here it is. - Be careful. - Okay. Be careful! How much did you spend on those blades? Not much. I got some money in advance. In advance… Are you coming home tonight? I don't think so. We're preparing for the Grand Tournament. Mom. I'm captain now. It's more than just being one of the team. Is more responsibility better? Mom, this tournament is really important. All of the big teams are taking part. By the way, the prize is huge. If we win, it could change our lives. The only thing that needs to change is you, Cenk. Ceren asks about you every day. But all you do is play games with your frie... I'm doing it for Ceren! Madame! - Ceren? - Ceren? - Ceren? - Ceren. Call an ambulance! Ceren! Ms. Özlem. It appears that the hole in the cardiac wall hasn't closed by itself. But, Doctor, you said there would be no need for surgical intervention. We never skipped a check-up and we kept giving her the pills. I see. But at this stage it does look like an operation will be required. If we leave her like this, the blood that goes to the right side of the heart can cause complications in the pulmonary artery over time. And that undermines the chances of further treatment being successful. That's why early intervention is so important. Enough with your bullshit, kid. The Odd Five this, Cenk that… Are you afraid that you'll lose the rematch? - Hey! - Look, kid, look… If you don't start acting smart... Greetings, boys. I'm looking for Sub Zero. Have you seen him? What, did your mid lane ditch you again? It's none of your business. Really? Let's go. İnanç, Cenk hasn't been here this week? He hasn't come by very often since he became the team captain. JJ, what should we do? How about a game? - You always say one game... - Stop whining. Come on. Consider yourselves my guests. Play as much as you want. How could we say no! Now we can play two or three more games! What's this Gamer Friday? There's a party this weekend. You can come if you want. Why would we go to a party? Don't say that. There'll be lots of pretty girls there. - Aslan! - JJ! - Aslan! - JJ! - Are you okay? - I'm fine. The team's gathered for a practice. They're waiting for you. Cenk, are you sure you're okay? Sorry. I guess I'm tired. Being the team captain, never-ending practice sessions… It'll all have been worth it when you win the tournament. Everyone is supporting you. The whole team. My brother… me… Cenk, say something. Come on, say something. Do we wait or attack? Defeat! Cenk, what the hell are you doing, dude? Cenk, are you okay? Sorry, I'm just tired. Don't do this to us a week before the tournament! You know how important it is to us. "Us"? It's important for you but not for me? I didn't mean it like that. Don't talk like an idiot. Enough! Take a break. Cenk. Cenk! Why didn't you tell me about this before? Look, I'm an only child. I could never fully understand what it means to have a sibling. But like you, I grew up without a father. I know what it's like to take on responsibilities at a young age. After my father died, I made a decision. I said, "Cenk, there's no one you can trust in this world other than yourself." I understand why you might be afraid of becoming a part of someone else's life. But you get used to it. You realize you're all alone. I used to think the same thing. But you don't have to get used to it anymore, Cenk. - None of that matters now. - Of course it does. Ceren might be ill, but she's alive. She has a long life ahead of her. No matter what others may say, when she looks back, she will know that her brother fought for her. Cenk. There is a reason for you to be here. You have a reason much deeper and purer than those… who are here only to prove that they are the best. What about you, Özer? Why are you here? What happened between you and Arda? A few years ago a rumor started that I'd cheated in that season's final. I never imagined one of my closest friends could have been responsible. So I ended up hurting someone else. Don't get me wrong, it was my fault. There's no need to blame anyone else. So, are you here to clear your name? Don't know. Maybe. I never really wanted to be part of the gaming world in the first place. But I do want to defeat Arda. Not because of my ego… but for the sake of justice. Cenk. You are a good kid. You know, whenever you need to make a tough decision, you must listen to the voice inside you. It'll never let you down. Check out the quality of my bow. Is your sword fake? - Does it look fake? - Sorry, but yes, it looks fake, bro. - What the hell? - What are these? What did you do to your eyes? - Seriously, which champion are you, dude? - Which champion? The most legendary soccer player ever to come from the Black Sea. Dozer. What's funny? Don't you guys know anything about soccer? Bro. This is a LOL-themed party. - Why didn't you tell me, JJ? - Don't you know which game we play? - What? - Nothing. - You kept us waiting forever, that's what. - What, Batu? I'd be amazed if you could say "You look beautiful" anyway. - She looks fantastic. - Say what? - Stop looking at her! - Come on. Cenk, all I want from you is for you to put aside these childish things. Why are you wasting your time playing games, when you could find a proper job and make a living from that? - Ceren! - Brother? Are you better, sweetie? - Did you win? - Not yet. The tournament is next week. - Will you win? - I will. - Do you promise? - I promise. Check this out! This is what I call a cosplay party! Cheer up. You were dying to come here. - I wish Cenk was here. - Exactly! How can we be The Odd Five without the fifth member? Okay, be party poopers if you want. Naz, come on. Come with us! Aslan. That's Lux! JJ! Come on, JJ! Come back! - Get lost. What's up, girls? - You get lost. You know Dozer? Excuse me? What do you drink? Who's Dozer, you midget? Don't get me started. Dozer. Let him go. What is it to you, girl? - What's your problem? - Batu! Stop! Let him go! Batu! What the hell is this? You keep turning up like cockroaches. Are more of you coming? - Stop! - Enough! Enough. Batu! You wouldn't expect anything else from a team coached by Özer. Why don't you say that to Özer's face? You think Özer is the shit. Don't you ever wonder why he stopped playing? Or… Nobody talks about Özer behind his back! Run, Batu! Run! Your nose is bleeding. Never mind! You should see the other guy. How are we all going to fit in the taxi? I can go separately. I want to stop by the hospital. There's another taxi stand ahead. We can walk there together if you want. Okay. Let's walk then. - Is the taxi stand really nearby? - Yes. We'll be there soon. - Shall we sit for a while? I'm very tired. - Sure. - They suit you. - What do? These wings. And those ears suit you. - Are you implying something? - Not at all. I'm glad you came tonight. I was happy to see you again. With the team, I mean. I promised my sister. We need to win that tournament. Ah! I still can't believe what you did. You stood up to Can. - No need to mention it. - It was a stupid thing to do. I was trying to help you. If I wanted your help I would've asked for it. Dad? You're home early. The committee moved the meeting to tomorrow. - Who is the young lady? - I'm Batu's team... This is Naz, my friend from school. Nice to meet you, Naz. Anyway, pretend I'm not here. All right, Dad. School? My dad doesn't know I play in a team. He doesn't understand it. Don't you think you need to tell him? How can I? He thinks I'm going to start working with him at his company. How are you going to manage a job and playing on the team at the same time? Batu, you can't hide what you're doing forever. First, I have to prove that I can do something on my own. That's why we need to win this tournament. Before the tournament you will watch all the games Özer played. The Odd Five's games too. There's only two days left. Are we going to spend them watching games? The secret to defeating Özer lies there. When you close your eyes, you should be able to see where The Odd Five's men are on the map and what they're doing. One of them is a woman. - What? - Four men and a woman. If you interrupt me again… I'll delete you. Are you tired? It will be dark soon. Take a flashlight with you. Are you going to tell us what this is about? When are we going to eat? Hand over your phones first. - You will spend a night in the woods. - What? You heard me. One night in the woods. To test your stamina and your survival skills. You know, a night in the woods… Anything can happen. Bears, wolves… I marked out a large area with pieces of red cloth like this one. A smaller area… with this color. And the smallest area… with this color. If you follow the trail correctly you will find a tent and a bag of supplies in the green area. But the tent is for one person only. There is just enough food and water in the bag for one person. The first one to find it will have a comfortable night. - The others, however... - Dude! I mean Coach! What's to stop me sneaking inside the van when you're asleep? - The van will be locked. - But the window won't be. If I see anyone outside the marked zone in the morning, they're off the team. Coach, isn't this a little much? To the green area, guys. To the green area. Your time starts now. Move! Does anyone see a yellow mark? - God help you. - No, you say, "God bless you." I hope I don't get sick. You idiots! Where are you going? Watch out, Batu! Watch out! You're going to fall, be careful! Don't force it! Batu! Cenk! Be careful! You're going to fall! Don't force it, Batu! - Aslan, throw me a stick! - Hang on! Grab this. Batu! Cenk! Guys! What the hell do you think you're doing? Batu, stop trying to pull the bag, push it instead! Push it to Cenk! Stop being so stubborn. You'll either get it together, or you won't get it at all. Come on! Good job! - Can you catch it if I throw it down? - Throw it! Cenk. Are you sick? - What's going on? - Maybe he's hungry? He has a fever. He should be the one who sleeps in the tent. I'm fine. I'm just tired. Wait. I have an idea. - Wake up. - What's going on? - Good morning. - Morning, Coach. This is what you planned right from the beginning, isn't it? Congratulations. You passed the test. Can we please go home now? You deserve a good breakfast. Give me some fruit, too! You are amazing, Madame Adile! You'll need all the energy you can get for the tournament tomorrow. Don't put those kids in danger ever again. You gave me full authority. And I'll take it back just like that if you keep abusing it. This was their last test. They're ready for the tour... To hell with your tests! This is not our old team! Cenk got sick. What if it was something serious? What if he couldn't play in the tournament? That kid would play no matter what. Look into his eyes and you'll know what I mean. What now? Is the old Özer back? Win or lose, you'll be gone after the tournament. Guys! Look what Ada has sent us! THE ODD FIVE - Whose is it? - Dozer's. JJ! JJ. SUB ZERO Ladies and gentlemen. You look great. I have a surprise for you. - A surprise? - A surprise. Coach? This room is empty. - Take a good look. - Please don't mess with us. This is the room we've never been allowed to come into, isn't it? Yeah. This is the most important room in the house, after all. This is the room where dreams turn into reality. We didn't talk about this before because our first goal was to become a team. Now that we are a team, we can focus on winning. This room is where your trophies will be displayed. Those trophies are only in here, for now. Now, look at the room… and imagine those trophies here. And tomorrow, bring your trophy and put it right here! DAY 1 GRAND TOURNAMENT Greetings, ladies and gentlemen. This year we are reunited at the seventh Grand Tournament, powered by Vodafone. The quarterfinals will be held on day one, the semifinals on day two, and on the third day, the grand final will be waiting for you. Here is some more information on how those matches will be decided. Quarterfinal and semifinal matches will be the best of three. But the final will be the best of five. We wish all teams the best of luck. You good? Let's go backstage. Being the best is not the hardest part, staying the best is. We've done the hard part, no one can stop us now. Ladies and gentlemen, today we have a very special guest with us. Murat, the famous YouTuber, will be here with us during the tournament. - Welcome, Murat. - Thank you. Murat, what do you think about Kozmos? Can they win the championship for a fourth time? I don't know about Kozmos. I think The Odd Five will win this time. This game was designed to be won by Kozmos. If you didn't understand that before, you'll understand it this year. Cenk. - Are you nervous? - A little. Don't forget… your reason for being here is more valid than anyone else's. Focus on that. The Odd Five are coming to the stage for the first game. The underdog no one took seriously is now the team everyone's talking about. Nobody gave us a chance. We're here to prove them wrong. We will win this tournament! Your only route to winning will be over my dead body. Go, go, go! Got ya. Phoenix versus The Odd Five is about to start. With consistent attacks, The Odd Five have reached Phoenix's base in the 18th minute. Phoenix have not yet got a tower. And The Odd Five are pressing on! They're starting to take the Nexus towers. Phoenix is falling one by one. Sub Zero made a triple kill. And one kill to Phenom! The Odd Five have gone 1-0 up in the first round of the tournament. The second game is almost an exact copy of the first. It's the 24th minute and The Odd Five are about to enter Phoenix's base. Sub Zero has leapt forward, Phoenix is trying to stop him but it's useless. One down! Two down! JJ is attacking the Nexus. The Odd Five have won the game! VICTORY The Odd Five! The Odd Five have won their quarterfinal match in their first tournament with an overwhelming victory. If you hadn't heard of them before, you'll certainly hear more about them now! The Odd Five are through to the semifinals. Here they are. That's it! Don't be shy, Cenk. I told Ada to record some backstage footage. Every team has a vlog, you know. Don't worry, I'll find a way to hide my camera. It's going great! Well done. THE ODD FIVE The teams are coming onstage for the second of our quarter finals. The winners of the third quarterfinal are Jey Wings! The TWU have just booked their ticket to the semifinals! The tournament favorites, Kozmos, are onstage for their first game! Some might feel the pressure playing on a stage as big as this, but this experienced team feels no pressure at all. Kozmos have caught 247 unprepared. 247 is retreating to recover. But Kozmos have no intention of stopping now! They have their towers and they are moving towards the Nexus. 247 is helpless. Kozmos is the winner of this round. Unbelievable! Kozmos have won without even losing a tower. Kozmos! It's best if we don't stay for too long. We wish your daughter a speedy recovery. No problem, thanks for coming, guys. I had no idea Cenk had such amazing friends. Thank you, guys. Ms. Özlem, you raised a wonderful kid. And a wonderful gamer. Thank you. - All the best. - All the best. DAY 2 After an exciting first day, we're here on day two for the semifinal matches! Samper used his "flash." Stark is right behind him. They're so far ahead they're not afraid of anything! And the winner is Kozmos! Kozmos will be playing in the grand final for a fourth time. The Odd Five are going hard on their opponent after that engagement. Last year's runner up, Jey Wings, tried to hold on three against five, but they failed. The Odd Five have booked their place in the final! That's it! THE ODD FIVE It's been seven years since we shared the same stage. Whoever would have thought we'd share it as rivals? Are you here to wish me luck for the final? No. I came here to declare my victory. You've been doing okay up to now. With that team… But it's time for you to stop now. You have changed. The old Özer would have said something, or let his fists do the talking. And the old Arda wouldn't be talking to my face… he'd be talking behind my back. He'd spread lies about me using an anonymous nickname. Come on, are you still living in the past? You were the one who brought up the past. Everyone smiles in the same language. But smiling is a choice. You can't choose to be tall or short, fat or skinny, smart or dumb. However… seven years ago you chose to end my career. The career that was bound to end ended! It's your ghost who has come here for a short visit. I hope we've acted hospitably. See you in the final. Come on, Sub Zero. You've kept me waiting for ages. I know I've been rough on you. - I acted like an ass... - No problem. No problem? Let's go. Don't you think we've got better at the Varus-Galio combo lately? How is it going with Ada? - How is what going with Ada? - Come on. I think you should invite her out for a drink. You can thank me later. Slow down! Tomorrow is the big final. It'll be an important day for both of us. Do you remember the promise I made you? Well, don't worry. After the operation, you'll open your eyes and see the trophy I won for you. I wish you could see me win. - How are you? - I'm fine. You know… when you said that you were talking to your sister that night, I didn't believe you. Anyway… I just wanted to wish you guys good luck with the operation. And of course for the final. - Thanks, but aren't you coming tomorrow? - No, I will be there. - It's just... - Do you… Do you want to grab a drink sometime? I can only invite you to the hospital cafeteria though. Cenk. I'd better check what she wants. - We can have coffee some other time? - Sure. - See you, then. - See you. I'll go now. The news on Reddit and Ada Uysal's private blog has already made headlines in the community. This photo was taken of Sub Zero, the mid lane of The Odd Five, visiting his sister in hospital. Makes me sad, man. But I have to congratulate Cenk. He's a real role model. He does everything for his sister. We've heard the prize money is to be used to fund Ceren's treatment. She's having an operation today. We wish a speedy recovery to little Ceren. Hi. Cenk. Why did you do it? I… I wanted people to see what kind of a person Cenk is. Don't, Ada. Let him be the one to show them. Let's see how long they can hold out against us. We will see. I wish them luck. They were badly defeated two months ago. We've been crowned champions three years running. We're the best at what we do. They are a new team. They don't have much of a chance. We'll wrap it up in minutes. It's going to be a very easy final for us. Come on, guys. Come on. It seems like the number of fans here has increased considerably since Ada revealed Sub Zero's story. Don't tell me you're an amateur who's going to be affected by this. - Brother. - Don't worry. If things don't go to plan, I still have my trump card. The Odd Five! The Odd Five! Neither team is in a hurry with their selections. The teams must take turns reading and countering each other's moves. It's almost like a chess game. As we can see, ladies and gentlemen, Kozmos has not banned Galio. If we consider Azir's superiority as mid lane, Galio wouldn't be a smart pick. However, it should be noted that Sub Zero hasn't lost any games with Galio so far. If we count the qualification matches, he is now 6-0 up. And yes, Galio's their last pick. And the final is underway! This is the first team fight of the round. Sub Zero has started the fight. Has Kozmos been caught? No! Stark and Jojo came from behind. Kozmos rebounded fast! The Odd Five are defeated. Victory! Kozmos is 1-0 up. The second match started very fast! Stark caught Phenom. Janavar is right behind him. Mikasa is trying to intercept. A great Ulti from Samper. Will Janavar be able to make the kill? A perfect leap from Hilti and Phenom is down. Kozmos have taken the second game! Why didn't you protect me? What? Kozmos have proved themselves once more, demonstrating overwhelming superiority. They are just one game away from a fourth championship win! Don't worry about the score. Each game is a new round. The only difference is that they need one game to win and we need three. Forget about them. Focus on your own game. Özer is right. We've made it this far. We can win. We're changing our draft. Come on! - One! - Two! - Three! - Four! - Five! - The Odd Five! Come on! I don't know what happened after the second game, but The Odd Five seem revitalized. They're much more in control. They're forcing Kozmos to play defensive. Let's see if The Odd Five can take the first inhibitor of this game. Gold difference is getting bigger. Four of The Odd Five are still alive and attacking the Nexus. Janavar wants to defend, but no, Mikasa is after him. They have Janavar, Samper is down. Janavar is almost down! Yes! The Odd Five have won their first match. We're also pretty pleased that we're going to see a few more games now! - Excuse me, ma'am, is the volume too high? - No, it's okay. We're emptying the atrial appendage. Kozmos is attempting a risky move here! They're trying to kill Baron Nashor to turn the situation in their favor. As you know, the team that kills the Baron receives a huge boost. But The Odd Five have no intention of allowing that. They've gathered behind Nashor. Let's see if their tactics work. Kozmos is ahead by a small amount. Stark has been caught outside. Sub Zero has burst in. Azir is stunned before throwing Ulti. The Odd Five have ambushed Kozmos! Unbelievable! Phenom made the last hit on Nashor. That was a clever attack on the Baron from The Odd Five! Janavar is helpless. He couldn't save the game. The Odd Five even the score! The score goes to 2-2. Kozmos has never had to play a fifth game in the tournament before. They're about to for the first time now. This really is an incredible final. An incredible fight, worthy of the grand finale! One game left, Cenk! Come on! Can, you just got a message. "If you care about your career, don't play in the next game." "If you play, I'll break your fingers myself." - Final game. - What's the plan? I will tell you, but first… - One. - Two. - Three. - Four. Five. - Excuse me! - What's going on? The match can't start. Mr. Özer sent a threatening message to Mr. Can. - What? - How come? What are you talking about? A threat was sent from his phone. There seems to be a problem. Some information is coming up on the screen. We'll have to wait for the last game. We apologize for the delay. Özer would never do anything like that! This is your phone number, isn't it? Unless you've changed it. If we check Özer's phone, I'm sure we can confirm it. I am not showing you my phone. Mr. Özer, handing your phone over to us would be a great help. I'm sorry, Mr. Özer, but taking your past actions into consideration, we will have to remove you from this area. Apparently "Bone-Breaker Özer" forgot to tell you why he was banned from previous tournaments. I can show them now if you want! Would you like that? Would you? Özer, why don't you tell your beloved students how you broke that kid's finger during that tournament in 2011? Özer! It's true that I've done things in the past that I now regret. But I didn't send that message. Mr. Özer, you should come with us. Okay, the event can continue. You should proceed to the stage now. Do you think… Let's go. The Odd Five are onstage without their coach. They will have to make their own decisions from now on. Ada! By the way, in the history of the tournament, no team has gone on to win the final without their coach. Kozmos has chosen not to ban Galio in this game either. I hope that decision won't let them down like it did in the third game. Don't hold back! Attack! Come on! The Odd Five have been caught off guard again. We're in the 22nd minute and Kozmos has a lead of 10,000 gold coins. Given Kozmos has Azir, when will they understand that it's a bad idea to allow Sub Zero to continue to pick Galio? Especially when we consider their defeats in the previous matches. In order to locate the VSD, we are making a small cut in the pulmonary artery. We have to wait. We have no other choice. - No. We initiate an attack. - What? The game plan went along with Özer. Aslan, you need to go first. Janavar tried to prevent Dozer from attacking them, but no. They're being slowed down by Mikasa's "Solar Flare." Come on, brother! Sub Zero has used his flash to get over the wall, Janavar is down! While Phenom clears Samper and Stark in the back, JJ And Dozer are chasing Jojo and Hilti. They're intercepted by Sub Zero and they're all dead! This is incredible. The Odd Five have really pulled this one out of the fire. - He's Sub Zero, right? - Yes, ma'am. - He's my son. - Really? The 10,000 gold coin lead is now down to 6,000 after The Odd Five won that fight. If The Odd Five can get the Baron, there will be a chance to equalize. But Kozmos has seen the danger. They're coming, all five of them. There's going to be a big team fight in front of the Baron. The Odd Five may try to bait them using Dozer. They went in now! The Odd Five are trying to kill the Baron but Kozmos have arrived just in time. Two of The Odd Five are caught outside. Mikasa is down, soon joined by Dozer! The Odd Five retreat, they can't fight five to three. Kozmos is trying to regain their position. Stick together. Only three of them left. No problem, Cap. We've got this game. Releasing the tourniquet. Excuse me. There's something you should see. Kozmos is hitting The Odd Five's base. Kozmos takes down the first inhibitor easily! The Odd Five have only three players alive and they don't want to do anything before the other two respawn. The Odd Five need another 20 seconds. Kozmos is playing safe. They're attacking the second inhibitor. Kozmos is about to take the third inhibitor. The Odd Five need a miracle if they're going to win this game! Five seconds before Mikasa and Dozer respawn. Come on! Three! Two! One! A critical moment. Everyone in The Odd Five has very low health. Kozmos has lost three players, though Janavar and Samper still have full health! The Odd Five are in trouble! The advantage they had earlier is about to disappear. Cenk is in trouble. Remember the night in the forest! The Odd Five have somehow managed to protect their mid lane! Only Janavar and Sub Zero are left alive. The clash between these two mid lanes will determine the final outcome! Victory! The Odd Five are the champions! Unbelievable. Nobody gave them a chance. And they defeated the three-time champions, Kozmos. That's it! Rüzgar built this team from scratch, and they defeated the strongest team in the arena in their first season. Look at this display of joy! The fans are going crazy! Nobody expected this win. Nobody would have bet on this outcome, especially when they were 2-0 down. But The Odd Five made the unbelievable happen and they're onstage now. No doubt delighted about winning the trophy, they're now shaking hands with the defeated Kozmos. Kozmos will be bitterly disappointed because they must have thought they had one hand on that trophy, especially after coming this far. But The Odd Five win the trophy, champions of the Grand Tournament, and winners of the one million Turkish lira prize. OPERATING THEATER Ms. Özlem. Ceren is doing well, the surgery was successful. - Thank you so much! - You're welcome. Our champions, The Odd Five, are lifting the trophy! Congratulations to The Odd Five! Özer! Call your mother. Cenk, the surgery was a success. Ceren is fine! They're moving her back to the ward. - Great! - Cenk… I'm proud of you. You played amazingly. Guys! Ceren's operation was a success! Mr. Arda. Özer. We can put this in our display room, huh? That room will have to wait a bit longer. There's another room more important than ours right now. The Odd Five! - Look who's here. - Surprise! Brother? Did you really win? Of course! All together. Did your brother tell you about us? - One! - Two! - Three! - Four! Five. Now it's your turn. The Odd Five! - Do you feel better? - Yes, brother. Thank you. Didn't we agree we'd go to Cenk's in your car? I told my father that I wanted to keep playing. He gave me a choice. He told me I had two options. On one hand I'd have my house and my car. On the other hand… the mansion, the game, you. So which did you choose? I chose you, of course! You know what? You are the man! I'll miss my car, I won't lie. Of course you'll miss it. That car was a keeper! - Now, go find us a cab! - Let's go. We should restart Turkish lessons, JJ. It's time for your medicine. No. Come on. Take it. You like this cartoon? There you go! Cenk! Darling, can you get it? Cenk, I'm so sorry. I hope you can forgive me. I wanted everyone to see the Cenk I knew. Maybe it was a mistake, but I will never forget that scene. You will always be Ceren's guardian angel. I've sent Ceren a gift. If you accept, I want you to put it by her side, so that it can watch over her and protect her. Like you've always done. Coffee? Mr. Özer. Wish the kids luck for the international tournament in April. CHAMPIONS LEAGUE What we're doing now is too risky. Managers can't talk to players from opposition teams. My contract with Kozmos has ended, as of today. I can speak to whoever I want. Nice.
