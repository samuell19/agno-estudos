Awesome. ANNIE: Shut up, Sam. Annie. I'm just worried he only knows one adjective. I mean, everything's awesome. Do you think we should have a tutor or something... Hey, hey, we're on vacation. It would be really nice if you and your father would try to get into the spirit of things. All right? John. John. Hang on a second. Let me finish this. Not you, my wife. JOHN: Sam was right. It was awesome and as usual I barely noticed. I had a department to run and patients to worry about. I really didn't have time for bearboating in the Caribbean. I guess missing our anniversary and being in surgery during Sam's birthday party finally put Grace over the edge. Hey, Dad. JOHN: So here I was psyching myself up for three weeks of sea sickness with my nearest and dearest. For God's sake I am a neurosurgeon. What was I doing here? Honey, this is Michael. He's our captain. Welcome aboard Dr. Everman. Well, Michael. Great day to be a sailor. JOHN: No, Michael, it was a great day to be at home in my study finishing my article for the New England Journal of medicine, but 20/20 hindsight is crystal clear. I didn't know any more than Grace and the kids that getting on that little boat would lead to an adventure so fantastic our lives would never ever be the same. I feel just Bluebeard closing in on one of Queen Isabella's galleons. Don't go out of control. Just do little adjustments to keep her on course. Like this? Yeah, like that. (TYPING) Even if I don't have your mind, at least I've got your body. Yes, every seminausated inch of it. Hmm. Are we supposed to be sailing? You sure this kid knows what he's doing? He is a grad student, isn't he? You know, I didn't read his resume, but his picture was so cute. Cute. Hi. Hi. MICHAEL: Oh, great. What's great? Broken fuel injector. Don't worry. (SIGHS) We'll just fix it at Saint Kitts. Not that cute. ANNIE: So what's the longest you sat around with no wind? MICHAEL: Longest? Hmm. Let me think. That would be 1989, Indian Ocean, four months. I had to eat the passengers. Really? Yeah. Were they good? Yep. Tasted just like chicken. You know, Michael, you don't make a half bad martini. Thank you Dr. Everman. We aim to please. So wife's a pediatrician, huh? What's it like having two doctors in the family? Terrific. Somebody's always diagnosing somebody. (BOTH LAUGHING) John, did Sam take his insulin? Oh, well, that would be a very good question for Sam. (CHUCKLES) You watch it, pal. You never know when your otherwise mild-manniered wife might sneak up and push you over board. (GASPS) Dad, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to. Congratulations, you almost killed your mother. Get in your cabin and stay there until I say you can come out. John, it was an accident. See, I told you there was life after video games. (LAUGHING) Hey, are you asleep? Annie, sweetie? Sweetie, come on. (BEEPS) Holy smoke. 103. You're a sick kid. Yeah, well, that's what I've been saying for years. (CHUCKLES) Very funny, Dad. Just let me work on her. I'll really fix her up. No more psychic tea. No more teenage antics. Right, right, Dad. Before we open up her skull, how about we try a couple aspirin and some fruit juice? Come on, Michael. Any moron can hold a compass course. Give me something hard to do. John, I don't think it's flu. Her pupils are dilated. She has mild tackicardia. I want a blood work up. Hold her steady, Admiral. I got to check something. Excuse me, folks. Michael, how long to Saint Kitts? Oh, a couple hours if the wind holds. Why? Annie's okay, isn't she? We don't want to take any chances. I'd like to get her to a medical facility. Radar out? Looks that way. You know, if you'd like, I could radio ahead to Saint Kitts and find out where to take her? Yeah, that would be great. Harbor master Saint Kitts this is the Tabula Rasa, Whiskey, Romeo, November, 3117. Over. (STATIC) Once again Harbor master Saint Kitts this is the Tabula Rasa, Whiskey Romeo, November 3117. Over. (STATIC) This is weird. Hey, somebody come up here. Look at that. Were we expecting this? No. Not at all. Mom, I don't feel so good. Okay, come on, honey. You probably got Annie's bug. I'll take you down to sick bay. I'm going to come back. Try to out run this stuff. Hold her steady, okay? I'll tell you when to turn. I don't know about you, Michael. Looks like a good old Manhattan mugging day. You and me both. That's not what I wanted to hear, pal. Mike, oh my God. (CRACKLING) JOHN: Grace! Grace! MICHAEL: John! John! (MICHAEL SCREAMS) (DOLPHINS CLICKING) (QUACKING) Grace? (COUGHING) John, what happened? ANNIE: Mom. Yeah. Yeah, come here. JOHN: Sammy, Sammy. You all right? Yeah. I feel fine. GRACE: Annie, let me feel your forehead, sweetheart. John, there's no more fever. John, help me out here. What exactly was it we hit that broke up the boat? Dad, look. GRACE: I didn't know there were active volcanoes in this part of the Caribbean. There aren't. If we had marshmallows and a guitar, we'd be in great shape. What are we going to do? I mean, is anybody going to look for us? Honey, I'm sure they've already started a search. I can guarantee my boss will be out looking for his boat. And just where will he look? Sea of the icebergs, land of the volcanoes? Sam, you have your insulin kit, don't you? Yeah, Mom. Give it here. Great now all we need is a pizza place that delivers. Michael, are you all right? MICHAEL: I can't find the North Star. I can't even find the Big Dipper. Well, if we were in the southern hemisphere, the stars would be different. Yeah, then we would see the southern cross. So where is it? Beats me. (GOLF CLUB SWINGING) (SWINGING CONTINUOUS) How come you hitting them into the ocean? It's the only way I can ever get them back. How's that? I have little friends out there that bring them to me. Are you senile? Probably a little. Hmm. I still have a heck of a swing, don't I? Do you know where we are? Yeah. Well, where? JOHN: Sam? Those your folks? Uh-huh. Well, time for me to give my welcome speech. Hop in, kiddo. Oh, by the way name's Slick. I'm, Sam. SLICK: Towns small, population 58. We have sort of a half bake town counsel. I'm the Mayor. I'd say we got about 60 inches of rainfall a year. Our temperature stays pretty much in the mid 70's, and don't mind that. GRACE: Oh! It's just a volcano belch. We get them all the time. (SQUAWKING) SAM: Look at those birds. We've the same birds in the zoo. We do not, not with those colors. Yeah, they do. You like the birds. Wait to you see our lizards. Did anybody bring a saddle? (LAUGHING) Well, there it is. Home sweet home. MICHAEL: What's it called? That is called Alien Oceanus. Hang on. JOHN: Like to get to a phone. SLICK: Sorry, can't help you there. No phone. JOHN: Okay, well, a radio. SLICK: Can't help you there either. Don't have a radio. JOHN: How can you not have a radio? Everyone's got a radio. GRACE: Look at this place. What kind of architecture is this? SLICK: You get a good argument going over that. There some say Babylonian some say Somian. But whoever it was he was the lowest bidder. Hello, Roberto. Slick. Roberto was trying to get to the States in a dingy but landed here by mistake. How are you, Ginnie? Hey, there, Mr. Mayor. Oh, well, hi. These must be our newbies. Folks, meet Ginnie-Mae Cooper. Ginnie-Mae, meet the Everman's. This is John, Grace... Hi. Annie, Sam and that's Michael. He drove the boat. Hi. Oh, well, you must feel like a real horses pattotie. (LAUGHING) Oh, that's all right. Now, don't let it bother you. We know it wasn't your fault. John and Grace are both doctors. Cut my legs off and call me shorty. Hey, we haven't had a doctor around here in ten years. That's great. Slick, you know what I'm going to do? I'm going to find them a house down there by the old clinic. Uh, excuse me. I don't think we're going to be needing a house. We're not staying. Mmm-mmm. Right, well, of course you aren't, darling. See you all later. Now look, Slim. Slick. We really appreciate you're picking us up, and I'm sure this is a fascinating town, but right now we're only concerned with one thing. How do we get transportation off this island? Okay. Fair enough. I usually save this part for later, but I can see you're an inpatient man. Go ahead. Open it up. Tell me which way you'd like to go. That's exactly what the compass on the boat was doing. So, tell me, Slick. How long have you been here? Since December 5, 1945 the day my torpedo bomber ran out of fuel and I had to ditch. Welcome to the Bermuda Triangle. The kids are asleep. (SIGHS) (RUMBLING) GRACE: Where does the electricity come from? They salvaged a generator from a shipwreck off shore. They stockpiled fuel. There's four hours of power every night. How civilized. Well, we're not staying. Really? You and Michael walked halfway around the island. This place exists, John. We're here. That's reality. I'll tell you what reality is. The reality is our son will die if we don't find a way out of here. He has five days of insulin left in his kit. He has a 90-day supply in the boat. We're going to have to get it. And assuming we find the boat, what then? We have three months to figure that out. (GENERATOR STOPS) (SIGHS) (DOLPHINS CLICKING) Look, you're not even remotely funny. You scared me to death. What are you looking at? (CLICKING) Trust me you don't want to know. Okay. Fine. My little brother is probably going to die, and I'm going to spend the rest of my life stuck here on some nonexistent island. Well, excuse me if I'm boring you. (LAUGHING) What the heck. Some people pay $200 to swim with a dolphin. (SIGHS) Hi. You must be one of the new guys. I'm Amanda Prager. Great. It's nice to meet you. I know, you can't believe any of this has happened to you. (CHUCKLES) No, I definitely plan on waking up. Wait a minute. Amanda Prager? You're that documentary film, you're dead. Well, I have felt better, but I'm definitely not dead. Yeah, but you disappeared or something, right? How did you get here? I was shooting off the coast of Puerto Rico. I was with myself, and I guess I got disoriented. When I finally figured out which way was up, I made it back to the surface and here I was. So what, where do you think we really are? Well, I have this theory that we landed in the same place where all those missing keys and sunglasses seem to wind up. (BOTH LAUGHING) Try to cheer up, okay? Believe it or not there is life after the world. Hey, Amanda... My name's Michael. Maybe we could, I don't know, catch a flick sometime? I would definitely consider a sunset. See you, Michael. Awesome. (FLUTE PLAYING) Who is there? Here, did you lose this? Wait, wait. I don't believe this. This place is a museum, not a medical facility. How could this have happened to us? I don't know. Sweetie, I wish I could tell you that everything is going to be all right. But I'm just as terrified as you are. What is it? GRACE: Insulin. A hundred ampules. ANNIE: It's all dried up. GINNIE: Hey, there in the clinic. I am so over her. Well, what do you think? I think most of this stuff would kill you, not cure you. Oh, well, well, of course. I mean, I know it's not what you're used to, but I was thinking, what if we just get a whole bunch of us, and we roll up our sleeves and clean the place up, huh? I don't think we've got enough sleeves. Oh, I really wanted you and your husband to run this clinic for us. You know everybody in this community has a job. Yeah? What's your job? Oh, well, I'm head of personal, honey. Tell you what I'm going to do. I'm simply going to report to the Mayor that you find these facilities unsatisfactory. Oh, we need more blankets for the house. The kids were cold last night. Hello, Ginnie-Mae Cooper, anybody home. Sorry. Sometimes I get so caught up in what I'm doing, I don't know if I'm putting them up wet or taking them down dry. Well, come on. Nora Bags, why aren't you in bed? Because I'm pregnant, Ginnie, not sick. I know, I know, but you have to get off your feet now. Hey, there, folks I'm Cal. Hi. Grace Everman. This is Annie. Hi. When are you do, Nora? April 12. Thank goodness for Ginnie-Mae or we'd never be able to keep things straight around here. That would be one way to look at it. Oh, my gosh, I just remembered I left the babies porridge in the kiln. Give these to your baby. All right now, Calvin, I'm telling you, you keep this women off her feet. Or you'll have to answer to me. CALVIN: Anything you say, Ginnie. Is this where we can get some blankets. You bet you and anything else you need. Hey, I got almost a whole bowling alley back there someplace. They don't want to go bowling, Calvin. They came for blankets. What is wrong with you? So I heard you're setting up the clinic? Any chance I can come by and get checked out. Sure. Does he bite? Only if you have wings and six legs. So, Nora, how did you get here? Like most of us. Wrong boat at the wrong time. We got a free vacation when Calvin got picked firefighter of the year back in Dearborn. It's funny. I remember watching the sunset from the deck of that ship, and saying, "Honey, I don't care if I ever see Dearborn again." (LAUGHING) How can you laugh about that? Honey, laughter is a shock absorber of life. (CLASSIC MUSIC PLAYING) (EXHALES) Nothing. No sign of the boat. You got to keep trying. We covered the whole lagoon. Besides, I'm out of air. Let's head back. What are you doing? I don't buy there's no way out of this place. How do we know the mainland isn't just over the horizon? No way. (GRUNTS) Great. We run out of gas. I hope you're ready for the long swim back. ♪ The bear went over the mountain ♪ The bear went over the mountain ♪ The bear went over the mountain ♪ To see what he could see ♪ Great. Now what? Look. MICHAEL: John, the island? It in front of us. How did it get in front of us? I don't believe this. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) GRACE: Hi. Where is Sammy? Exploring. I told him not to go too far. You didn't find the boat? That's not all. There is no way out of here. You try to leave. You just come back. (SOFTLY) What? Oh, my God. Annie? Let her go! John, this is a time for pulling together. Mom, guess what I found? (FLUTE PLAYING) Honey, listen to me. Until we find the rest of your insulin, we're going to have to conserve what we've got, okay? So we're going to have to adjust your dosage and your diet. Yeah, sure. Good. You remember where I showed you I'm keeping your kit? Go get it, okay? John, I know you're going to find it. I absolutely know it. Hey, honey, how's it going. Oh, that well, huh? Look. Just, please, leave me alone. But I hate to pull rank on you, but as Mayor of this berg, I'm obligated to see that everybody feels warm and fuzzy at all times. So arrest me. Well, that could be a problem. Never done that before. I don't know the procedure. Look, you're not funny. You like to read, huh? What's it to you? I read a book once. Really? Was it a comic book. I like you, Annie. You know, I like you so much, I'm going to have to give you a gift. Let's see... Ah! There play with this radio. You never know what you might hear. Anybody home. Over hear. Hi, there. Hi. Slick said you might have another regulator. This one's not cooperating. Absolutely. How's it going? Any sign of your boat? No. John and Grace are pretty wigged out. (CHUCKLES) You must really like vegetables. Yeah, I grow them for everybody. I'm garden girl. Queen of the carrots. I'll make you a salad some time. I'd like that. Hey. Where did you get that? Nowhere. ANNIE: Nowhere? You got it nowhere. Well, considering where we are, I guess that's a fair answer. Don't you have anything better to do? You know, when you were little, you were actually pretty cute. Argh! You were. You were crazy about me. When you were three, you told mom you wanted to marry me. Well, I don't anymore. I'd marry someone like you. I mean obviously older and not my brother. Do you want to borrow money or something? I'm just telling you that I like you, all right? Deal with it. Annie? Yeah? I found it in the jungle. Cool. MICHAEL: How's that? Okay, just slide the diaphragm towards me a little bit. Like that? Yeah, that's it. Okay, now let me tighten it. Listen, I've got my tights. It'll go a lot faster if you got another diver working with you. Really? You sure. Yeah, I'm sure. Well, I'm pregnant, aren't I? The baby's upside down. And I don't know if there's time or room enough to turn it around. Well, what are we going to do? Well, if I were back at New York General I would have recommended a C section. But we're not at New York General. Yeah, I know. I'm counting on you. Calvin and I already lost two babies. Nothing can happen to this one, Grace. Okay. Whoa. (GRUNTS) (COUGHING) (GROWLING) (GROWLING) (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) What? I don't know what you're saying? You mean, this? (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (FLUTE PLAYING) (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (FLUTE PLAYING) No way. No possible way. Ahhh. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) Thanks, but I don't think so. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) I can't. I have diabetes. It can make me very sick. SLICK: So the boats got a few rocks on her. We'll dynamite them. Slick, if you use explosives to move the rocks, how do you know you're not going to smash what's left of the boat or the insulin too? Because the insulin's too important to be smashed. I wouldn't let it happen. It's all so risky. Well, beating Hitler was risky too. We had to do it. Look, I was a mining engineer before I joined the service, and I know a thing or two about blowing stuff up. Maybe we can get the dolphins to help us move the rocks. Oh, they'd do it for us, honey if the rocks were a little smaller, or they were a little bigger. This is really wonderful, Slick. Yeah, wonderful. Well, you folks have a lot on your mind, and I thought the least I could do is bring you a big old fish. (CHUCKLES) Mom, if we don't get the rest of the insulin out of the boat, am I going to die? (THUNDER RUMBLING) Don't worry about those. I'll do them later. No way, you cooked. I'm cleaning. Okay, I give up. How do you turn it on? (WATER RUNNING) I see. I had a really nice time tonight. I'm glad you stopped by. What? Past tense? Aren't we still having fun? Yeah. What? Talk to me. I'm married. I can't do this. Where is he? In Chicago I think. We'd only been married six months when I left to do the shoot. He would have come with me, but the Cubs made it to the play-offs, and he just had to go. I always thought that grass growing was more exciting than baseball. (BOTH LAUGHING) And the only thing he loved more than his precious Cubs... ...was me. SAM: Where are we going anyway? Wow, let's get a closer look. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) This is a real doubloon. So this must be a treasure ship sunk around here. You're just leaving that. What? Okay. Okay. (KNOCKING ON DOOR) Come in. Hey, there. Hi. How's the homework coming? Listen, breach births are not a big deal under twenty century medical conditions, but here I... Calvin, I'm a pediatrician. I haven't done this since med school. I'm just not sure you really understand what the babies chances are. I'd have to say you are wrong about that, Doc. I know all about chances. I was a medic in Vietnam. Then I made my living fighting fires and pulling people from burning buildings. I almost drowned on my way to this crazy place. As far as I can tell, chances are just about the only thing we can depend on. Look, I'll be there with you. I believe in you. Nora believes in you. She knows you're going to bring us our miracle. (STATIC) (WATER SPLASHING) Hey, where you been? You're so smart, why don't you go down to the boat and get Sam's insulin, uh? All right. You're going to get it. (BREATHING HEAVILY) You get it? Sure, I got it. There is enough dynamite in that crate to blow us back to the real world. Of course, we wouldn't look to good. How old is this stuff? Who knows. It was here when I arrived. You're not exactly filling me with confidence. Careful. Oh! I don't have any idea how stable this stuff is. Okay. Now we're good to go. We'll blow the rocks at midday tomorrow as soon as the tide turns. (GRUNTS) I ran out of primer. Oh, God, I hope this works. Me too. Listen, about last night, I'm sorry. You don't have to be. And you don't have to explain. Michael, I haven't felt like this in a long time. It's pretty scary, but I know it makes me feel like I might lose the one thing I'm holding onto so tightly. The thing that gets me through every day. (SIGHS) And I just don't know if I'm ready to let go of him. I'm not here to make your life harder than it is. Let's just be friends, okay? Thanks. ANNIE: Slick, please stop. Look, I don't know why he did it. Hey, hey, hold on, kiddo, what are you talking about? The dolphin, I thought you told me they were friendly. Yeah. He took me down to this airplane. There was a skeleton. I almost had a heart attack. But those old guys don't have a mean bone in their body. Well, this one did. Annie, I've been around these creatures for a long time, and if one of them took you someplace, I'm inclined to think he had a very good reason. I'm going into town. You want a ride? No, thanks. I'm okay. I'll walk. Okay, honey. Take care. Roberto, what did you do in Cuba? What everybody does in a socialist country. I pretend to work, and they pretend to pay me. (GRUNTS) (EXHALES) The happiest day of my life was when I got in that little boat to go to America. Well, I'm sorry you didn't make it. I have a feeling you would have done well there. Things aren't so bad here. The trick is to think you're at this kind of resort that you can never check out of. I bring the rest of your stuff this afternoon. Hola, Doctor. Well, sweetie. Thank you. I can't remember the last time you brought me flowers. Yeah, well, you know you pick flowers in New York, you get arrested. God, this is so strange. It could be 20 years ago. You remember that apartment we had in med school? The one we shared with the lovely roach family. Well, it didn't matter. We were together. I was so happy. So was I. Oh, I don't know. Maybe we're getting another chance to start over again. All right. What will we be this time? A couple lawyers? No. No. (BOTH LAUGHING) Oh, hi. Hi. Almost done. Take your time. It's not like I got any pressing engagements. You know, I just realized this morning, I don't have to finish my master's thesis. Great. Now you can just work on your tan for the rest your life. Somehow I don't think the world's going to miss one less anthropologist. So what were you going to be? Well, I'm genetically program for medicine, but I always thought I'd be better at slouching around some Cafe in Prague writing bad poetry. (LAUGHING) You know, when I was your age, I wanted to ride a banana boat down the Amazon. You're not that much older than me, Michael. Yes, I am. Well, I'm going to go work on my tan. I'll see you later. Awesome. (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) (BOTH LAUGHING) (VEHICLE APPROACHING) Come on. I'll let you sit in it. Come on. It's not going to bite you. Come on. I'm going to get a jeep when I turn 16 or a Porshe. Come on. Hop in. I'll take you for a spin. (IMITATE ENGINE REVVING) Come on. You shift. No, not that one. (BOTH SCREAMING) (HONKING CONTINUOUSLY) Oh, great, great. Now we've done it. SLICK: Hey, what the heck's going on down there? Go, go, go, go, go. (STATIC) (MUSIC PLAYING INDISTINCTLY) (MAN SPEAKING) I don't get it. What did you think you were doing? I don't know. You could have killed yourself, not to mention somebody else. You got to think, Sammy. You got to think about the consequences before you act. Dinner's ready. Go wash your hands, sweetie. You take your medicine? I forgot. I'll take it now. You know, Dad, I'm sure you did some pretty dumb stuff when you were ten. I never had the chances. I was too busy walking ten miles to school in the snow. Ten? I thought it was five. No, no. That was the paper route. And don't forget he was the sole supporter of his dear widowed mother. That's right. Mom, I think I lost my kit. What do you mean lost your kit? I don't know. I had it in my pocket. I guess I dropped it someplace. What did we tell you about taking your kit out of this house? You don't lose the thing that keeps you alive. How could you be so stupid? I'm not stupid. You're stupid. All you ever do is put me down. You know he's right? You are stupid and so many am I. That is a ten year old kid. We are the ones responsible. Amanda. You okay? Yeah fine. Fine. Listen to this. (UNCLEAR MALE CONVERSATION) (BOTH LAUGHING) He might be at this ballpark right now. He's there. I know he's there. (SIGHS) Dollars to donuts, we uncover your boat today. The charges are laid and Michael is stringing the primer cord. Right. So my kid lives three months instead of three days. I can see you're a glass half full kind of guy. Sure, sure. Here I am stuck in the middle of the 27th dimension somewhere. At least you have your wife and kids. Most of us arrived here alone. You know, John, you don't just have to die in this place. We got some good folks here. You can make a life here. It's your choice. You know, it's strange. When I'm in an operating room, I'm like a little God. I mean, I can give somebody back their life. Out here I haven't a clue. I don't know where to start. I can give you some advice on what not to do. Yeah? Well, it probably wouldn't be a good idea to be dead drunk for a couple of years feeling sorry for yourself. (CHUCKLES) Don't look so surprised. I wasn't any different than you. We've all gone through it. The trick is to find something, anything that makes you want to get up in the morning. And once you found that, you got her licked. ANNIE: Dad, Dad. Dad, here. Sam's gone. He left. Mom's out looking for him. What are you talking about? He ran away, Daddy. Have you are ever noticed how grownups always seem mad? (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) No wonder they have heart attacks and ulcers and stuff. Have you ever seen a kid get a heart attack? I don't think so. Wait. Is that where you came from? (SPEAKING OTHER LANGUAGE) I don't understand. Oh, wow. SLICK: Okay. Everybody from here over, you beat the bushes this side of the river. All you people fan out and stretch the trail end of the interior. Let's move out, folks. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) Grace, Grace, now listen. I don't want you to worry. We'll leave no stone unturned. The people of this community, we'll find your boy. Thank you, Ginnie. Mom, I have to go check something. No, Annie. I'll be fine. Don't worry about it. Sam. MAN: Sam. Sam, hey where are you? GRACE: Sam. CALVIN: Doc. Doc, it started. She's in labor. Nora needs you now. Okay. Let's go. Please. I need you. Come on. Where are you? Hey. (CLICKING) All right. You want me to go in that plane? (CLICKING) Is Sam down there? Come on, people. Let's hustle. Tides turning. (NORA CRYING) Okay, don't push. Don't push. Okay, Calvin, we're almost there. You got to keep her breathing. You're okay. Please, Grace, don't let anything happen to my baby. It's going to take a lot more than this clinic or this island or an upside down baby to get the best of us. All right? (GRUNTS) I'm scared, Grace. I know, but you got to stay with me. Stay with me. It's miracle time, doc. All right. All right. All right. Don't push until I say. Then you give it everything you got okay. Okay here we go. (EXPLOSION) (DOLPHINS CLICKING) (GASPS) (THUNDER RUMBLING) (BABY COOING) GRACE: Good, it looks like you've got it all. Wait a minute. Where is the box of syringes? John, where are the syringes? We brought up everything we could find. We didn't see any syringes. Well, now we've got insulin, but no way to administer it. Yes, we do. Here. JOHN: Where'd you get this? ANNIE: The dolphins took me to it. GRACE: John, look. Oh! Thank God. All right, Annie. Hey. (SIGHS) It was in the shrine near the volcano. There was a gold coin with it. Well, that sounds like Maia kid is trying to teach him how to suck up to the volcano God, and I bet he took him into his village as soon as the storm broke. Who are these people? Are they dangerous? Well, they keep pretty much to themselves, but I've never known them to hurt anybody. The thing is we can't get up there until the storm let's up. (THUNDER RUMBLING) Visibility up there is about eight inches. You couldn't find your butt with a map. Listen to me, Slick. Sam will go into hypoglycemic shock without this. I'm going after my boy. That's all there is to it. (STUTTERING) I want my mom. (FLUTE PLAYING) Ah... (SCREAMING) (GRUNTS) (GROWLING) (BREATHING HEAVILY) (GRUNTS) (SCREAMING) (COUGHING) Believe in miracles. JOHN: Oh, God. Sammy? Hey, Sammy. Hi. Did you bring my insulin? No, I tried. I really did, but I lost it. Well, you came for me. That's the main thing. JOHN: Yes, Sam, was thriving even though he didn't have a single dose of insulin since he lost his kit, and for once I was content to accept the possibility of a miracle. But despite my efforts to make peace with our incredible situation, I still had to convince myself that I'd get us all back somehow. Someday. Oh, I forgot to tell you, I dreamt about the house again last night. Good. Hmm. It was strange. I woke up in our bedroom, and I reached over to turn off the clock radio, but it was on your side of the bed, not mine. Yeah, well, it's definitely on your side of the bed. I know. Don't let me forget those kinds of things, okay? You aren't going to have time to forget. We're going to find a way home. JOHN: Home. Even as I heard myself say it, I couldn't help but wonder maybe when all was said and done this extraordinarily, strange, and wonder filled place would turn out to be our home.
