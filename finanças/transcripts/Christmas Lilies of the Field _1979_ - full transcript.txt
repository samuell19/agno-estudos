Brian: No, it was built by the Jesuits and the Indians. Special bells were cast in Spain, shipped to Mexico, sent North by wagon. But somewhere between here and Hermosillo the wagon disappeared.

Now the normal procedure would be for me to supply you with a stack of application forms which you would fill out, four copies of each, and then submit to this office for processing. [speaking German] I'm sorry, what is processing? Oh... Well, the process is to make 20 or 30 copies of your copies, then distribute it to all employees above a certain grade. Then when enough time has passed, the director, me, if I'm still here, will stamp his copies funding refused. Now if the director wants to pass the buck to his successor, then he'll stamp his copy deferred. But the kindergarten must be finished December five-teen. Hmm? December five-teen, Herr Pruitt. Sister, compared to bureaucratic processing, the Chinese water torture is a joy. That's not very funny. I'm gonna be kind and tell you right here and now, your request is refused. Why? I asked you why! Well, Sister, there are many reasons. Here... Well, here. Right here. The location that you have chosen is-- It's isolated. It's impractical. What is wrong with my location? Well, now the staff. The staff. Yourself and four other nuns. You have no experience, - no training. - We have five nuns for nine children. That really should be enough! Ultimately, Sister, your kindergarten would be an expensive, unnecessary duplication of existing facilities! But the children have nowhere else to go. Now, Sister, that is not true. I have been assured that all of these children will be placed in excellent foster homes. But this separates them. They should be together as a family! Impossible. Nothing is impossible, Herr Pruitt! Nothing! Sister, as far as this agency is concerned, your request is refused! Sister, I'm sorry. I'm a Catholic. God bless you. ♪ [Dramatic music] ♪ Mother Maria, in the long run, isn't this for the best? [hammering] [roster crows] [goat bleating] [hammering] Looks nice, the kindergarten. Yeah, well.

Well this God-fearing Baptist kept his part of the deal, and you... Me? I fight to keep this place together, to keep the children here together, Not your American bureaucracy! No organization or charity, not you! Nothing will separate these children. Well, I'm cashing in my chips and taking my losses. I don't play against these kind of odds. Your kindergarten just isn't gonna make it, Mama, So stop lying to me, yourself, and these kids. Don't look at me like that. I did everything I could, didn't I? We all did. So we couldn't pull it off! You'll be okay, so... Homer, where are you going? El Paso. "The Mother General further directs the bishop to inform Mother Maria that since the kindergarten will not become a reality, she must prepare immediately for reassignment. She and Sister Gertrude will be returned here to Austria. Sisters Albertine, Agnes and Elizabeth will be given new assignments in the United States. Signed, Sister Magalina, Executive Secretary to the Mother General." I'm very sorry. All our work here... Nothing. We lose the children. Now we lose each other. [door closes] Thank you, Father Connor. I shall prepare to obey... The orders of the Mother General. [sobbing] Goodbye, children. All right everybody, off to your new homes! Onto the truck, and let's everyone be responsible for his own things. Where's your duffel, Homer? I'm not Homer! I haven't got a name! Let me help you up. No. Jane Doe, wanna sit up in front with me? No. There's room up in front with me. This is the last time we'll ever be together. Will you write me? I don't know how to write. [engine struggles] [engine continues to struggle] - Congratulations, you won. - I didn't write the law! But it makes you smug and secure to know somebody else did. Mr. Smith, you're being grossly unfair. Isn't it my turn? Why'd you come back? For one reason. I'm gonna take Pokey back to her own people, and no government agency or representatives thereof better get in my way. Come on, Josh. Get lost! What kind of foster home you got in mind for Pokey? I... I haven't been able to place her. It's difficult to place an Indian child. She'll have to go to an orphanage. Is that what you want? Pokey... Ask your folks if they could use a black Indian. You have no right to come back here and interfere! I have court orders for that child! Sue me. ♪ [Western music] ♪ You recognize this place? What's this? Come on. Come on. What is this about?

We agreed her place was with her sisters. Yeah, well you see... There isn't gonna be a kindergarten anymore. There isn't any money. And even if there was, the government wouldn't let them stay open. But the place is needed. A lot of people talk about how good it was, but nobody's raised a hand to keep it going. Nobody ask us. We would help. Yeah, how? We are good builders. We could also give food. But we'd still have to fight the whole government. [laughing] We have some experience there, too. You really meant what you said? You'd really help? You and the other men from the reservation? Why did this have to happen? We could walk. Long way to town. I planned it so carefully. I wanted it to go exactly right. [child] Car coming! [Josh] I'm a good hitchhiker. Hey, it looks like... - Pokey! - Hey, it's Pokey! Pokey! Pokey! Pokey! [cheering, laughter] [Josh] Pokey, so glad to see you! The engine just coughed and sputtered and died. I did everything I could. - Trang, get behind the wheel. - Yes, sir. Look, it's not gonna do any good. It won't work. If we could just all get into your camper... Trang! [engine starts up] Everybody in the truck! Are you going into town with us? Nobody's going into town. I'm not giving up! There's going to be a kindergarten! [cheering] I don't believe this. You've already made that clear. Tell me one place in your rules and regulations where it mentions L-O-V-E. Bring the camper back. You? Quitting? Look, I was wrong. - What about the children? - Let someone else worry. You think of yourself. Now I think of myself too. And that's what you want. Doesn't matter what I want. Mother Maria has her orders from the Mother General. Look, it matters to me. Mama, it seems to me you oughta count your blessings. You've got a good thing going. All right, so you can't use credit cards, but we got the labor. All we need is the materials like you promised. It will not be here! Sister Gertrude will go with me to Austria. The others are being sent where they are needed. Sister Agnes and Sister Albertine will to go New Jersey, Atlantic City. And Sister Elizabeth will go to Las Vegas. [sobbing] You're gonna blow this whole setup? You built a chapel! It is not finished! You made a home for a lot of kids! Mother Maria is being, as they say, kicked upstairs. Yeah, well I'd like to-- [sighs] Look, there's more than one way to skin a cat. [Brian] The bishop says unless the kindergarten is built, he will have to transfer everyone. Okay! Okay, not even a bishop is gonna separate Pokey from Josh and the others. So you will build the kindergarten? Yeah. I tell the bishops the kindergarten is going to be built. You do that. I will tell him. You get the labor? - I will get the labor. [Maria] - And the material! And the ma-- What? I go and see the bishop now! Where am I gonna get the materials? The bishop will bless you. - Cut that out. - And I... I will bless you. Where am I gonna get the materials? Remember the power of prayer! Where am I gonna get the materials? Where am I gonna get the materials? [sobbing] Where am I gonna get the materials? [laughing] I must see the bishop right away. He's leaving in an hour for the state capital for a memorial service. That old truck will never make it by then. All right, you bring the truck to the cathedral. You'll never make it on time. Oh, yes I will! But just get our things out of the way. Allow me ladies.

I thought you went back to town to alert the cops - about rules and regulations-- - Homer, I was wrong. Did you say... I said I was wrong. People do make mistakes and are sorry. Sometimes other people even forgive them. You mean we've made a believer out of you? I do believe Mother Maria now when she says that faith can move mountains or... build kindergartens. Now if you could stop the law from closing us down and taking those kids... There's a section in the code which seems to contradict the section about proximity to a school. I'll request a court ruling and that should delay any action for a while. Great! That'll give me enough time to start borrowing from within. All right. Welcome to the team.
