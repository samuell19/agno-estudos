Humans built villages to protect themselves from wild animals. But there are wild animals under the scarf of injustice in villages. To seek the justice, he walked back to the forest. And his every step turned out to be a cold-blooded path. And changed every village into a den of Warrior's clan. And one of them is Sriramagiri. The beginning of this story was happened there. I'm pissed off early in the morning. -One tea please. -What sir? -You're on duty early in the morning? -As it's cricket season... I'm getting calls regarding connectivity issues. Hello...

POLICE STATION PINAPAKA MANDAL, KHAMMAM Sir. Sir... Sir... Warning! You can't stop our revolution with these idiots. Those who oppose us will face the same punishment in our court. By, Singanna Team! -Sir. -Hmm? Mr. Chenna Reddy and Mr. Sesha Reddy came to meet you! -Ask them to, have a seat. -Okay, sir. Take your seat, uncle. What made you come here uncle? It's about the agriculture labors. Yes, uncle. We need to stop it here itself. Everyone want the same, Eshwar. They are demanding for hike at the peak moment. If they are asking for a small hike, we never mind about it. But they're demanding more than we offer. What will we save then? They say, "Leeches will become strong, once water enters the sea." These blockheads are behaving like this, because of those Naxalites. It shouldn't happen. You come to Police station after an hour. Will decide what to do later? Okay, let's go. MEGASTAR HOTEL -Hey server. -Yes, sir. -Send 10 teas to police station. -Okay, sir. Okay, sir. If we get laborers from another village, Our villagers will cause a riot! It'll be a law and order issue, for me. Are we knuckleheads, if they come to fight? Even we know what to do. The same will happen what happened in other places. Don't get furious, Mr. Reddy? Atleast, you convince him, Eswar Reddy. What should I say, Giridhar? They are demanding hike every year. This year it's 50, next year how much to everyone. Should we hike as per their demand? They won't ask every year. Tell them to draft it and we will think. -Veeraswamy, call Mr. Narasimhulu. -Sir. Narsimhulu, sir is calling. -Greetings. -Greetings, Please sit. -Sir, tea. -Yeah. -Greetings. -Hmm. -Greetings, sir. Tea. -Serve to, everyone. Look, Mr. Narsimhulu, they're ready to hike your wage. But promise them that you won't demand hike for next year. You promise us that daily needs prices won't increase and we will promise you. Our demand is reasonable but yours isn't. What is in our hands? Everything is in Naxal's hands. Sir, we don't know them. We aren't puppets in anyone's hands. This is the decision we all labor's took. These guys made us laborers in our own farms, as we took hand loan from them. It's our land. We're working. And we're farming! Speak all of them in your meetings, they'll listen! Wage isn't depended on your mercy. It's our right. If you won't pay us, your lands will be barren. You should throw away everything. It's waste of time, to discuss on this. We'll take your leave. Mr. Narsimhulu wait. Sir, you convince him. He's just blabbering. We know how to handle him. Let's go uncle. -Lal Salam, Comrade. -Lal Salam. Why did you wake up so early? This is the life of us. I'm living this life since 15 years. We don't know who will attack us. We won't have enough food and sleep in this forest. We won't even get water sometimes. It's just two books and a bag with two pairs of clothes. One pair on us and other will be washed. These are our assets. Sometimes, we won't have these too. A revolutionist in forest is just like a soldier in border. This is for the sake of people and their welfare. To bring Lights in their lives. Fine, what's the news? They're not willing to increase the pay for labors. But, our Narasimhulu didn't agree. They're angry in the meeting held. I'm suspicious about them. If they do any harm, They will loose more. But, I'm worried about the Farm labors. We shouldn't bother about death once we took a stand. Since ages they're working for peanuts. We shouldn't loose our grip for their sake. Okay, brother. -Swamy, how are everyone in the village? -All are doing good, ma'am. Why didn't they chop the fields? There's a fight happening about wages. Laborers are demanding more and farmers are not increasing the pay. It's not yet settled. Are the Naxals involved in this? How can these laborers be so stubborn, if they aren't backed by them? Did they ask about wages till date? They're able to ask atleast now. It's good to hear. Take the money and from now on, take care of yourself. Okay, sir. -Are you good? -I'm good brother. -How are you? -I'm good -Come let's go inside. -Come dear. Come and sit. So, is your journey good? Your favorite ghee poori. Come, I will serve this for you. No, I don't want brother. I want to drink good coffee. Oh God, None can prepare coffee as per your taste. My day will be blunt, if I don't drink good coffee. -Swamy... -Sir. Understood... Sirisha needs good coffee. I'll go and get it. To where? There's a Mega Star hotel in our village, Coffee is a masterpiece in that hotel. -I'll go and get. -Swamy... We need to drink coffee hot. I'll come with you. Even I drank coffee in that place. Go and drink. Thank you brother. MEGASTAR HOTEL -Is this for your son? -Yeah. -I'll try this. -Okay, try. Hell with your tactics. Will you kill me or what? Leave me. Everyday he will comes up like this, and eat our brains. It's me brother. What brother? will you kill me or what? Stop it brother. Hey, stop it. Hey, stop it. He saw Adivi Donga movie at night and is killing me as if I'm a tiger. Hey, go and prepare a coffee. -Madam? -Yes. -One special coffee for madam. -Okay. Dear, he is Chiranjeevi freak. -Freak? -I mean he's fan for him. Come, have a coffee. Have a seat, please. What's with this guy, Swamy? He's a nice guy, but will go crazy for his hero. -Swamy... -Madam. This coffee is too familiar to me. Special coffee to madam. To where now? Thank you. -Thank you. -Sit down. Coffee was fantastic. Who prepared this? Our brother Ravi. Ravi? Call him once. -Ravi. -Yeah. Madam is calling. He is Ravi. Sirisha, is this you? Ravi what are you doing here? Is coffee good? So good. Ravi, you and here? This is our hotel. Are our friends good? Good. Why are you here? What happened? -Brother, What happened? -Brother. -Swamy, start the car. -Okay. -Get up, brother. -Careful. Brother... Turn on the engine. Increase the Speed. Brother... Brother... -Hold him carefully. -Yeah. Move faster. -Doctor. -Doctor... Doctor... Doctor! -What happened? -Look after him, doctor. Take him inside. Oh God. Father... Father... Father... -How is he, doctor? -Doctor? He is dead. Oh God. Dear... What are those papers, Ravi? It belongs to his land, it seems. From past one year, He is roaming... to every office with this papers. And he's unable to clear his debt and that creditor... bribed to MRO and registered this land under his name! No one is reliable in this office. Should whack them all. Whack? What you mean by that, Ravi? You'll draw a picture on paper. If there's a small mistake, what will you do? Will you erase it or tear that paper? Then, why won't you think like that about people? If we kill the ones who did mistake... there will be corpses in the place of humans! Let's go Ravi.

I didn't sell it, sir. He took 2 Lakh rupees from me and he sold his land to me. 2 Lakh rupees? Why? Because of your son's acheivement. You send your son to study well, but he didn't, despite knowing he will fail so he leaked the question paper. What is this son? It turned out to be a case in Police station he came to me took 2 Lakh rupees, and got him out. Hey, am I on the correct timeline? This is unfair, sir. I didn't sell... I didn't sell.

Dad... Father? Father? Father? Dear... Father... Father... Wake up for once dad, please. Father. -Hey. -Hey Ravi, wait. After that, for our land, I approached the officers. But even they too... This news has to be printed in every news papers. Send this letter to the victim. -Lal Salam. -Lal Salam. To free ourselves from these ruthless landlords, we must fight. We have to make poor people walk towards the Welfare society. This team is inviting you. Come, let's fight together. Lal Salam. I joined this revolution that no one has to lose everything like me. Turned out to be an Informer. For that, we will kill or we may die. No matter what, we will bring that, Class less Society! We will install the, Communist Society. What you mean by 'Class less Society'? The society which was created by our communists in Russia, China and Vietnam. The peaceful society where doesn't consists of Caste, and Religion, by our... Lenin, Stalin, Mao, Che Guevara and Fidol Castro. That's what we dreamt of. That's what, our revolution motto was. As of my knowledge, In Nazi party, after Globals... none can match the propaganda in this world except your communist people. The Vigor man, Stalin. The Gem, Mao. Errajenda... Reading books like these... You don't know what's the death rate of these communist parties did, Ravi. Do you know, how many people were killed by, Stalin? 2 crore people. He even crossed Hitler, in killing the people. He sent people to Siberian camps and he tortured and killed them. Russian soldiers who took over the Berlin, at the time of Second World War... they molested the every women in public places. And it was took place, under the supervision of, your leader, Stalin. And your Communist God, China Chairman, Mao Zedong... by using the Great Leap Forward, Cultural revolutions... he killed approx. 14-20 million people. And This, is the history of blood written by your Communist Leaders. In their countries, there'll be no phones nor papers. They don't even have the Freedom. In 1962... China took over us and occupied the land no one dare to spit a word. Do you think, Naxalites are pretty good enough with scores? In a village called, Naxalbire located at West Bengal. In 1965, This revolution was formed because of Jothidar. A for Arms B for Bengal C for Charu Marjumdar. Do you remember the statement by, Charu Majumdar? Without killing the people from category, how he can be called as Freedom Fighter? And that's the beginning for your Naxals. From 1965 to till date, you guys killed around million people saying the revolution. K. S. Vyas, Pardesi Naidu, Umesh Chandra, Sripada Rao... Duggirala Venkata Rao, Hayagreeva Chary, Budda Vengal Reddy there were many in the list who were killed by your Naxals. What you have achieved, by killing all these? Did you brought up the Companies? Did you arranged for jobs for unemployed? Did you built houses or hospitals? What you guys did? You did nothing! If you built, it's development or else, it will be destruction. You guys did, Destruction. What the development, you guys did? You mean, don't we did any development in this long revolution? Yes, you did. Telangana Sahita Poratam, Srikakulam Sahita Poratam, is because of you guys. Landlords are decreased, and fares are increased. It's because of you. Namboodiripad, Jyoti Basu, Somnath Chatterjee, Puchalapalli Sundarayya... Tarimela Nagi Reddy, Chandra Rajeshwar Rao, Nalla Narasimhulu... everyone mentioned here are Legends. But, they are people leaders. They never hold a gun and walked into forests. They won in the election and look after the people's problems. But what about you... You guys are saying NO to elections? Instead of killing people with Gun you can save 10 people with Pen! Guys like you shouldn't under the revolutions. You have under the Country's welfare. If we goes by killing people, one day we will kill our loved one too, Ravi. Listen to me. Leave everything and come with me. There's a beautiful and bright future awaits for you. Come. Sign on it, Sirisha. Please try to understand me. Ravi? Sign, please. Sirisha... I want to stay alone for some days. Please understand me. Listen to me, once. Swamy, I'll let you know. Dear...

Sir, he's caught in Marijuana case. I don't have any connection with this, sir. -Police are framing me in this. -Shut up. What's that non-sense there? In our checking, his vehicle contains Marijuana.

Move aside. Brother... Brother... Brother, please don't blast it. -Brother. -Hey, wait man. Brother... Stop! Sirisha... Sirisha... Sirisha... Sirisha... As time passes by, the distance grows Time disappears, distances will increases And I'm left wondering What with this? What with this? The tales I heard, once seemed so true But now my dreams have turned to blue As the distance between us... Continues to rise! I feel like a statue, frozen in my demise -Take it Ravi. -I don't want. Have it, Ravi. How many days will you be like this? I don't want anything. -Leave it there. -Okay. Eat them. You will die, if you won't eat. It will be nice, if I die. Those words will be said by a Loser and a Failure. Don't prove that your a loser by crying. We're not Lord Krishna and Arjuna to preach, Bhagavadgita by stopping this war in the middle! We are revolutionists, Ravi. We work on duties, not on emotions. These hands are ones who has to wipe the peoples who lost everything. Not to look after us. No matter, how many times a soldier may face defeat, he have to return back to war. Be prepared. Sebastian. Greyhounds commander. You mean, if someone is recommended by DGP mean, he is so powerful. But, he is... There'll be strategy for everything. To catch a pigeon, we have throw a bait. To catch a fish, we have throw nets. There's a strategy for Singanna. We are tired to listen all that crap. Catch him and then start preaching these. Sir? Where you have been all these days? How are you brother? Would you get me a coffee? I will get for you. Here it is, brother. Brother. Sirisha madam, gave it to me to give you. Did Sirisha can to here for me? Yes, brother. She came here before her death. She is like an angel brother. They killed her Unnecessarily. Doctor! The patient is got up brother. Brother. Where to brother? Hey I have some work. -Brother! -Hey you stop. Brother. Leader of the Naxals, Singanna is surrendered. Revolutionist Singanna who agonized the cops around the Sri Ramagiri. He amalgamated into the stream of life in the presence of grey hound cops. He said he will say later about his next step. We still have to know the reason that changed him. I thought another thing when, you said about the strategy. The vulture which ate 100 buffalos died to a single cyclone. Do you know the cyclone's name? Sebastian! You are super Sebastian. Without spilling a single drop of our peoples blood. You caught a big Naxal. Your strategy in not normal. Don't forget the commitment that you given to me. I will do it. Take it. I will be back. You are super. Hey. Who are you? Where is our leader? Are you a member of Singanna? Answer those with only asked you. Do you die for Singanna? You spoken about future just now. Say it, if you had wish for your life. I don't have much time. -Hey. -I won't say. It is not a normal knife, It is poisoned. You will died in two minutes. Say it. I will tell. I will. In Srinivas lodge. Ravi, why are you here? Okay get in. Hey, what is this? Get up brother. Hey Ravi. Hey, Ravi. Hey come here. Hey Ravi. Untie me. Hey Ravi, what happened? Come and untie. What happened to you? Untie me. Do you think the press meet and surrounding to the cops are all real? It is all about the strategy, we shouldn't rush into the war when the enemy has the upper hand. We have to act like surrender. It is not real. It is tricking the enemy. I did the same thing, don't believe it. First untie me Ravi. The lose will come from all the side in revolution. You and I are still alive. we can build another army. And carry on the revolution, first untie me. What? I want to clap whenever you talk. And believe what you say. I almost believed you this time also. This was stopping me. Once Karl Marx said, 'Religion is a intoxication'. But Communism is more intoxication than that. I understood that, I need a strong evidence to bring you out from that Communism loop. I went to my friend Swapna's home, after I withdrawn from the election race. I need 25 million immediately. Thank you. Enough. Enough. I said, enough! Don't you get my point? Dear... What happened, Swapna? I have been observing it. I can sense that you guys are not peaceful. His business turned out like a hell, Sirisha. He invested in his business by taking loans. All the works are paused in between. They say, Contracts will earn more, right? He won't say me anything clearly. Can I try talking to him once? If it's money, I will help you out. -Brother? -Huh... Tell me, dear. I understood that, you are worrying about money. Yes, dear. That's how the Agency contractor life was. Nothing will go in smooth pace. Hurdles from everyside. We have to built the buildings for people's welfare. And have to bribe every idiotic creature. In addition of them, Now Naxals are also added into this list, for my life. They won't release the funds until the work completes. And these won't let work. I can't understand what to do. Naxals? How they are involved in this? That's where the problem is. They say, they will fight for people but they are habituated for extortion. None is correct, dear. Which group, Brother? Pinapaka Mandal Naxals. They have asked for 25 million. -Hello? -Dharma... I have to share an important news with you regarding that Singanna's Team. I want to talk to you personally, Hey, get out. Tell me. After brother's death, Singanna's team came and kidnapped me. But I saw a guy there, and he's the one who collected money from brother, too. That's the point where I start suspecting Singanna Team. I will take care. Don't panic. I am Chandranna's man. Don't do anything to me. Let him sit. What you need? What you need is in here. These are the money from contractor, right? There a looking anew. Hey... Hey. Will you confess or will you die in my hands? Spit it out, idiot. Tell me. His loyalty has won, before our stick's strength. Chandranna, will die in the encounter. But his wife Narasamma, Daughter Mamatha, son Naresh. Going to die in another encounter is the bad news here. Tell me, Sirisha. What's our next move? You won't listen to anyone, if you fixed for a decision, right. Das, ask to not bring the newspaper on tomorrow. Okay sir. Reading the article which was known is simply boring. Sir, I'll will tell you. I will tell you each and everything, sir. I will tell, sir. I am working at Singanna from past 20 years. We used to work hard, for the welfare of poor people. But one day... Say what I said to Eshwar Reddy, and bring 10 Lakh from him. For what, brother? What you mean by, 'For what'? Past day from that contractor, On yesterday, from the builder... and today, from Eswar Reddy. For power. If we have money, we will get the power. If we have power, we will get the money. I want both of them. Hitler want to become a painter, by joining at a academy. They rejected him. Do you know what Hitler did? He created a Nazi party, and started trembling the whole world. Mohammad Ali Zinna, wants to grow in National Congress Party. No one cared about him. He divided country into two, with his party. He turned out as a, Pakistan Chief Minister. In whole world, if we able to spark a fire between two different castes, religions or regions. The power will come to our feet. No matter, where the location was... this will only happen. Even I am the same. I joined as a normal revolutionist in the party. But now, one name is circulating everywhere. Singanna! Singanna! Singanna! And, I love that. We can only rule this forest by living as Naxals. We can rule the whole state if we into the politics. Chandra, do we have to die here for our education and our intelligence? Give a thought. By listening to them, I started thinking about it. I got to know that he is misleading the revolution because of his selfishness. But, I didn't find any other way. By following Singanna's order, we went and met, Mr. Eswar Reddy. Singanna asked 10 million as party fund. If you pay that money, he said us to say, there'll be no price hike issue. That much money? Why should I have to pay? You are in a trance, that you are going to win. People are not innocents, Reddy. You don't need to say what is happening here. What is the guarantee that, I'll be the winner in elections, if I pay you? For sure, you will be the winner. Think about it. You are smart. Okay. But one condition... I want to meet Singanna personally. I will look into it, But, one thing. This shouldn't be known to anyone. Be careful. As per Singanna's strategy, we got money from Eswar Reddy. Then he called Narasimhulu. You have to withdraw from the elections, Narasimhulu. Withdraw? It's a long 30 year wait, brother. You are making me out of this. Why brother? Committee has asked to stand you in this elections. And the same committee is asking now to withdraw. We have to follow the rules of Central Committee. We don't have any other option. There are many people who trusted me on this. I will stand independently by myself. I can understand your confidence, Narasimhulu. I will talk with Central Committee. Wait for sometime. Don't be so hasty. Lal Salam. Lal Salam. As Narasimulu opposed his word he killed him brutally. And framed that, this was done by Eswar Reddy. And then he killed the Eswar Reddy too. We are planned to meet. But not expected it will be like this, Mr. Eswar Reddy. Why are you so angry? You are going to die, as you killed, Narasimhulu. Why you want to meet me? There's no connection with Narasimhulu death to me. I want to discuss the Village problems... Lion is king to Forest. Either it may Forest or a Village, This Singanna is the King. I made a blunder mistake, sir. It's Singanna, who did this. Is there anything remained to confess? Sirisha, said the same on that day. What the hell was happened in this long-protest? Nothing. Because of Sirisha, her villagers got their lands back, brother. Because of you... Tyagi has silted his throat, brother. Narasimhulu, Eswar Reddy, and many more innocents. Because of your Power freak, they lost their lives. Veeraswami, Pallaniyappan, and many more cops are dead in your conspiracy. What brother? Because as they stand behind you, they were dead now. Those are innocents, brother. You pumped them with your words... they believed that you are going to change the society. They need is, A Society where there'll be no Corruption. Whether, it's forest or a town. She's a gem, brother. She is the one, who born for a cause, brother. You made me kill her with my own hands. You made me a devil. All these actions under this Flag. And underneath the mask of this violence, theft, cheating, everything has to be end. They have to! If you want to see the society which you dreamt for... you have to leave this world! In the fair of earnings And Naxals land mines Are many corpse of landlords And many Naxals are martyrs In the mind game of politicians And the sacrifice of many youth Did you find it in any of the scapegoats? Did you find it in any of the scapegoats? Sindhooram Sindhooram Darkness is Sindhooram Sindhooram Sindhooram Darkness is Sindhooram There are nearly 1.5 lakh Naxals and their democracy is ruling over there. The places like Adilabad, Khammam, Midnapor, Gachiroli and Jagadalpur... are still witnessing blood because of them. We hope that they stop these fights and survive in this human race and fight about their rights by following law. Team Sindhooram! OUR VOTE IS FOR OUR ZPTC CANDIDATE, SIRISHA REDDY
