Sir, congratulations on the district. I've heard that Tejpur is a rough district. But you won't have any problems. DIG Verma is there. Thanks. You may leave. It's time for the train and I've to make a call. Your attention please. Tarapur-Katihar Express... - Get the luggage... - Okay, sir. Will arrive at platform number 3. - What's the matter? - I want to make a call to Nalanda. Wait for two minutes. How are you, son? Why didn't you call yesterday? Anu was so worried. Here, talk to him. I don't want to talk. What's the matter? Tell me. I didn't get the time yesterday. It was 12 o'clock by the time I finished the office work. Yes. I know everything. You're smoking again, aren't you? You women have a telescope in your nose. I don't even touch cigarettes now. You are an expert liar. Tell me. Why did you call? Orders have been issued for my district posting. - Really? Where? - Tejpur. Tejpur? Have you gone mad? I am not going to that wild place. Fine. Stay with mother. And I will eat guesthouse meals for the rest of my life. For the district, just a gold medal from the academy is not enough. You need something else too. I was posted to Tejpur because nobody wanted to go there. Naturally. Who would like to go to such a violent place? What place is not violent these days, Anu? Don't worry. Try to come as soon as possible. Impossible. Amit, you know how much I fear bloodshed. I was against your IPS. And now this Tejpur. Anu, it is not what you think. It's just a job. And a person who works according to the law doesn't face any hurdle. And you know that even I don't like violence. - Anu. - Yes. Listen, if I refuse now, I don't know when I will get a district. And I can't live without you. There's a bungalow and a huge garden there. You are going to love it. - When are you leaving? - Now. The train is leaving in five minutes. I will reach the divisional headquarter at Motipur at 7o'clock tomorrow morning. I will take the charge from DIG Anup Verma and then depart for Tejpur. Get your reservation for the next week. - Fine. - What fine? Come on. Cheer up, Anu. Bid me farewell properly. Otherwise I will sit here and smoke all night long. And I will not get on the train either. What? You were smoking, weren't you? I knew it. Let me come there. I will teach you a lesson. Okay, bye. Bye. Bye. - Sir, want a drink? - No, thank you. - A small peg? - Thank you. As far as we know, this is your first posting in a district. Yes. Are you both businessmen? Yes. He is Nandkumar and I am Satyasheel. We have a sugar mill. By the way, can I ask you something private? What is the district rate of an SP? I don't understand. Tejpur is a lucrative district. There are so many mafias. The minister must have taken a hefty amount. Excuse me. You guys are misunderstanding. You too, SP. Just last year... that Lakhi SP... - B. Prasad. - B. Prasad. We financed his transfer. You see, we have a factory there. There is too much labor problem. Back then, the expense was Rs.50 lakh right from the local MLA to the Home Minister, Dwarka Rai. Yes. I didn't require any finance. ADDITIONAL DIRECTOR GENERAL OF POLICE - Good morning, sir. - Good morning, sir. - Hello, Amit. - Sir. - Come. Sit. Come. - Thank you, sir. Tejpur is the largest district in our Motipur division. It is a disturbed area. The last SP C.P. Gupta was treated badly. He was a nervous man. New IPS. He locked horns with the mafia of that place. He lost honor as well as the district. But you don't worry. The DSP of that place, Burelal, is my man. He is very efficient. He creates harmony between everybody. You just relax. If there is a problem, call me. I will settle the matter from here itself. Sir. You will get full advantage of my experience. I have 70 years of experience. 70 years. What? My father had joined the British police force as a head constable. In 40 years, he retired as a DSP. I was directly recruited as a DSP. 30 years ago. Progressing gradually, today, I have become a DIG. From the bottom to the top, I keep contact with everybody. You are very lucky that an officer like me is your DIG. Sir. - What happened? - Sir, I think the fuel pump is damaged. Check it. Sir, I think the fuel pump is damaged. Is there a garage nearby? Sir, Shikarpur station is nearby. We'll get it repaired there. The car will reach there if we drive slowly, sir. Fine. Sir, we have reached Shikarpur station... - Is this Shikarpur station? - Yes, sir. It is a vast area. This is the only station from Bholapur to Kosi banks. - Fine. Get the car repaired soon. - Okay, sir. This looks like the SP's car. - Sir. - Where is the in-charge of the station? Sir, he... Sir... Sir, the inspector is getting a massage. He has a backache, sir. Sir, yesterday he had gone for patrolling. The road by the river is very bad. So, on the motorcycle... Sir... - Who is it? - The big boss. Sir, the big boss has come. Bhola Chaudhary. In charge of the station. Shikarpur, sir. You are lying here this way? What if it were some dacoit instead of me? Sir, what will the dacoit find at the police station? Why? They can steal your weapons. Sir, they have the best automatic guns and rifles. Our 303s get jammed anyway, sir. - Come to the office. - Yes, sir. Go to the market. - Get the best tea and snacks for sir. - Okay. - Hurry up. Hurry. - Yes, sir. - Is this your FIR register? - The stationary got over three months ago. Sir, I have submitted the requirement to the headquarters. But nothing has been entered after the 12th of last month. But sir, I have noted everything. I have just not entered it. Do you file the FIR in this? Sir, there are only minor complaints here. This place is very peaceful. What do you know about this area? Do you even venture out? Sir, I would tour a lot. But my jeep has broken down. And for the past one month, there is no money in the diesel fund too. - Then how is the work done here? - We borrow Papu contractor's vehicle. And if there is an emergency, the car from the fuel pump arrives. Sir, I have maintained relationships with everybody. At the time of emergency, there is no problem of car or horse. Sir. - Sir, I have served the breakfast. - Okay. Sir, come. Sir. - Is it done? - No. It will take three more hours. Sir, accept Papu's greetings. You were saying there is no money for even diesel and fuel. Then where did you get such a grand breakfast from? Sir, Shikarpur is not so backward. Yes, sir. And sir, as long as we are here, you don't have to worry. You won't get any chance to complain. - Where is this bus going? - To Tejpur depot, sir. - Stop this. - What? - Go. - Yes, sir. Hey. - You guys repair the car and come. - Sir. Sir, take our car. Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop. Sir, have a piece. It's extremely fresh. I have made it especially for you. Sir. Sir. Sir. Had it been a night halt, we would have had the chance of serving you well. - Hey. It's sir. Be careful. - Yes, sir. Start the bus. One ticket for Tejpur. Sir, I am a family man. If I take money from you, sir will thrash me. If you won't take it, I will get down from the bus right now. Sir, you can thrash me if you want to. But don't make me commit this sin. Sir, I think they are checking. What for? Sir, it's the police party. I will cajole them in a jiffy. I am so silly. When sir is in the bus, who will dare stop it? Go ahead and pass the bus. Don't you dare utter a word. You guys will not say who I am. Get down. Get down. Go to sir. - Come on. Come on. Move. - What trouble is this? Come on. Get your bag, luggage, and briefcase. - There's checking going on. - What for? Don't ask too many questions. Remain seated. He has asked the right question. He has the right to know. Don't act smart just because you're wearing a pant and shirt. The police can check whenever they want to, understand? - Whose luggage is this? - Where is your officer? What's the matter? He is at the check-post. - Hurry up, Ram. - Whose luggage is this? - It's mine. - Open it. Excuse me, sub-inspector. Why is the checking going on? I am asking you, sir. Hey, Chaturbhuj. What is this gentleman's problem? Sir, he asks too many questions. - Where are you coming from? - From the vicinity. Where are you going? - Look, sub-inspector, I just... - Shut up. I will ask the question. And you will only answer. My name is sub-inspector Mangni Ram. I will teach you the law in two minutes. Understood? Do you know the power of an inspector? I will lock you up in a minute. You will rot without any charge. You will be in a bad state right here. I was just asking what you are checking for. It is very troublesome for the passengers. - Hey, Chaturbhuj. - Sir. Take him. I will teach him a lesson. He doesn't understand words. We'll show him some action. Hang on. Hang on. Are you arresting me? What else? Shall I honor you? What are you doing? Have you gone mad? Don't you recognize him? He is Tejpur's new SP. What... Sir, I made a grave mistake. It was a blunder. You're stupid. You don't even recognize sir. Sir, I made a mistake. You are God. Sir, forgive me. I will be ruined. - Forgive me. - Get them away. Sir, I made a mistake. Don't do this, sir. I made a mistake. I won't repeat it. Hang on. Stop this charade. - Give me a paper. A plain paper. - Sir, I have it. Take this. Here. - Sub-inspector Mangni Ram. - Yes. Write your statement as to why I shouldn't suspend you. Sir, forgive me. The more you cry, sub-inspector Mangni Ram, the more you will have to write. Sir, forgive me. Forgive me. I was stupid, sir. Contractors are running our police stations. Our cars run at the mercy of the fuel pump. We accept bribe openly. Our way of working is worse than the criminals. Can I ask why we are doing this job? Who are we serving? Why will the people have faith in us? I know that these speeches won't have any effect on you. But get one thing clear. This won't work with me. You all understand the rules and norms, police manuals, and your duty very well. I will not tolerate illegal and wrong deeds. You all will do your work honestly and diligently. And not I, but the people should know about this. Sir, I have heard your speech. I was just standing outside, sir. I have realized it, sir. Now, I will never follow the wrong path. - Fine. - Thank you, sir. You have forgiven me. Now, I will become an honest man. Sir, I will take the medal of the best sub-inspector from you. Hang on. Hang on. You are mistaken. I have still not forgiven you. I had asked you for justification in writing. You have still not given it to me. How can I do that, sir? I will lose my job. Give me one last chance. - My children will bless you. - You are wasting your time. If you don't give it in writing, then unwillingly, I will have to do it. Then do it, sir. Write my death warrant with your own hands. I am from a backward caste. That's why my plight is such today. I took a loan of Rs. 3 lakh to bribe a minister of my caste to get this job. Sir, I am still repaying it. And my friends here have become experts in corruption. Look at inspector R.K. Singh. In three years, he constructed a two-storied house. - Because I am from backward class... - Hey. - Don't talk rubbish without any proof. - Stop it. Stop it. - R.K. Singh, sit. - He's just spouting nonsense. - What nonsense am I spouting? - Mangni, come out. Sorry, sir. But you think about it. Thrash me black and blue if I have said anything wrong. - Mangni. - Sit. I will check it out. Sit. Come out with me. With the support of the powers-to-be, you're a lion. Ridiculous. - Don't talk rubbish. - Rubbish. I am talking rubbish. It's futile to talk to him. Mangni, what are you doing? Keep quiet. In front of sir... I will not tolerate this. I will not tolerate this indiscipline. You look just like a goon. - I am one. - Leave me. - Or else... - What will you do? I will call the police. I will lodge an FIR. Is that so? I am the SP of this place. You will be imprisoned without a charge. Get lost. Sir, this is yours. - It seems light today. Why? - There was less collection, sir. Less. Nonua told me something else. - Then go take it from him. - What do you mean? - Why are you guys creating a ruckus? - I am not, DSP. I have been suspended. Moreover, less share in this too. - You get it for free, that's why. - What do you mean? R.K., there is a confusion because Nonua is giving the wrong picture. Meet him and clear the matter. - Sir, everything is clear. - Clear. I think he got impatient. Greetings, Mr. Singh. Why did you take the trouble? You should have sent a message. I would have come. Stop your rubbish. Enough of your hypocrisy. Sir, have a seat. Why are you getting infuriated? How did the DSP come to know about the bribes? What are you saying, sub-inspector? I will behead myself if anybody can prove that Nonua has said anything. Don't fool me. This had to happen. It's not good to deceive each other, R.K. Singh. What you did was wrong. He's dead. You leave. And remain quiet for some time. I hope the new SP doesn't create a hubbub, DSP. I am here. Let him remain here. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Every year we have to come for Sadhu Yadav's feast on Mahashivratri. My wife is Shiva's devotee. Sadhu Yadav's arrangement is also very good. Have you met him? No, sir. I have been busy because of Nonua. What is the progress in Nonua's case? Home Minister Dwarka Rai had called. He was saying that a dacoit killed an inspector. How will I answer in the parliament? Amit, arrest a couple of people. And one or two... understood? Yadav will be famous as long as there are stars and moon. Yadav will be famous as long as there are stars and moon. Yadav will be famous as long as there are stars and moon. Hail Lord Shiva. Hail Lord Shiva. Greetings. Everything will be fine by God's grace. Don't worry. - Come, come, Bholenath. - Greetings. - Dear. - Greetings. - Come, Tiwari. God bless you. - Greetings. Come. God bless you. - Greetings. - Bless you. Take the blessings, SP. You have come to Shiva's temple for the first time. It's Mahashivratri today. You will get whatever you ask for. Do it. Lord Shiva is benevolent. He knows what you need the most during this time. Ask. What's the harm? Come on, Amit. Ask for something. You just might catch hold of Nonua. Sir, I will nab him anyway. Because no matter what guise Nonua and culprits like him are in, God will not protect them. Sir. On the night of the murder, Nonua had come here. He is Chandisao. Lala's trader. He traded goods with him, sir. - Did he say anything? - No, sir. He is not saying anything. Take the rest to the police station. - Leave him here. - Yes, sir. Take him. Sir, take me also to the police station. I will not remain here alone. Come on. Look, sir. This is not fair. Take me to the police station too. It is not my mistake, sir. - Did Nonua come here? - Yes. Where did he go from here? Sir, he didn't say anything. He left at night. Sir, I swear on my child. I don't have any relationship with him. In fact, he took all my cash, sir. Come to the station and record your statement. Sir. - Who are they? - People who were connected to his gang. - Did they say anything? - No. We've still not asked them properly. Note down everybody's name and address. - Name. - Sir, Laxman Pandey. - Where do you live? - In this village. What about you? Sir, I don't have anything to do with this. I put up Pansari's shop in the big market. Sir, he has a young daughter. She used to keep Nonua's company. What is this, Mr. Tiwari? My daughter got married a year ago. She has gone to her house. To Sultangarh. Now, how will she meet Nonua? He has been arrested on the basis of suspicion, sir. It was the DIG's command. The minister has called for a press conference tomorrow. I swear on my child, sir. Enough. Enough. POLICE STATION TEJPUR Sir, what do we do with these people? Leave them. Let them go. Okay, sir. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings. - Greetings. - God bless you. God bless you. How are you? How is your son? Everything is fine. I have called you this late in the night. I had to send a gift for your SP. He is here... With you? He murdered inspector R.K. Singh and came to me. For the past 12 days, I have given him shelter. Now, his time has come. You are dear to me. That's why I am giving you the chance. Use him in such a way that it is beneficial to everybody. SP as well as you. And me too. If I take him alive, the SP won't spare him. He will make him spill out everything. Everything will be ruined. Then kill him. It will be easier to carry him. What are you thinking? Look. He started peeing. Idiot. Idiot. Baba, tea. Have tea. It will get cold. - Hello. Control room. - Inspector Bachcha Yadav speaking. Sir, Nonua and some of his men attacked me suddenly near Saraiya bridge. I too fired. 12 rounds. Two culprits were killed and the others escaped. I am coming with the dead bodies. - Nonua got killed. - What? Killed? - People are saying that. - What? Nonua got killed. - Nonua got killed. - Yes. Look outside. Move everybody. - Move. Move. - Move. Yes. But you said Nonua has crossed the border. - Then how did this happen? - Sir, I had received this news. Find out how Bachcha Yadav got hold of him. Yes, sir. Keep him here. Move. Now move. Move. As soon as I crossed Saraiya bridge, he attacked me. - At what time did this happen? - Around 2:30 or 3:00. - Move. Move. - Move. Sir, we've kept them at the police station. I received the encounter news at night, sir. - Move. Move. - Give way. Move. Move. - Move. Move. Come, sir. - Move. Move. SP, great. Even the Mumbai police don't give such quick result. Really. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live the SP. Long live the SP. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live the SP. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live the SP. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live the SP. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live the SP. Welcome, sir. - Come, Mr. Mishra. - Greetings. - Greetings, sir. - How are you, Doctor? - Fine. - Greetings, Minister. - Is your business running smoothly? - It's your grace. This is what you call a result. Did you see that, DIG Verma? He is our man. You arrested fake people and informed me. Our officer killed the real culprit. That is true. Amit Kumar has become an encounter specialist. When I sent him here, I had given him just one duty. To liberate Tejpur from crime and corruption. And today he has kept my faith intact. On this platform, I want to declare that on 26th January, Amit Kumar will receive the President's gold medal. The success that Amit Kumar has achieved - in such a short span of time... - Found out anything? I am trying, sir. You only try. Here this new guy has become a hero. No, sir. I will find out very soon. Actually, Bachcha Yadav deserves the real credit. Yes. Yes. Soldiers fight. But the commander-in-chief gets the medal. Peepra robbery case. You got the case on 7th April. And by 13th May you arrested five culprits and solved the case. Raniganj double murder. You took both the relatives involved in the murder in custody within 72 hours. Saraitola rape case. Lathupur murder case. Naingarh conspiracy. And the remaining 18 cases. They were given to you. And you succeeded beyond expectation. Excellent. You solved majority of the cases with your intellect and hard work. There was progress in the investigation. And as far as I think, there was no corruption. Good. Seeing this, there is no doubt that you are a good, honest and brave officer. But when I glance at these files, my understanding betrays me. I don't understand how you didn't get transferred from this district in the past seven years. How all of Sadhu and Sunder Yadav's cases were handed over only to you. And there was no progress in their cases. I don't understand what happened... to your bravery and honesty in these cases. You got Nonua from Sadhu Yadav, right? Sir, I don't understand what you are saying. You won't even understand that I hate this the most, and today because of you, I was made a hero. And if you think that under the favor of your fake bravery I will ignore your deeds, then that's your mistake, Bachcha Yadav. Sir, you... Why do you work for Sadhu Yadav? How is he related to you? No, sir. It is not so. What did you give him in return of Nonua? Your conscience? Or did you try to sell me? Sir... I don't understand. But I understand very well. You work for the police. But you are loyal to Sadhu Yadav. Sir, you... Sir, I have not done anything like this. Bachcha Yadav, I appreciate honesty and bravery. But I am not blind. What you have done in Nonua's case is cowardice. And I won't tolerate such a character. I want to know the truth. And you will tell me that. Understand? What do you think? Just because you belong to his caste, he will protect you? Such people see neither caste, nor blood ties. They just see their benefit. When he betrayed Nonua, who had come to his shelter, what is the guarantee that he won't betray you after his needs are fulfilled? You may leave. How are things at home? - It's your grace, Baba. Everything is fine? Give it to him too. Thanks, Baba. You, take this. Baba, give me first. I have been suspended. Yes. Mangni Ram. You take two packets. Very good. Take this. What is going on? God has fulfilled your wish, SP. It's a thing of pride for Tejpur. You will get the medal. I am distributing these to celebrate that. Come, sir. Come. Stop all this immediately. And who gave you the permission to carry out this charade here? SP, I am the King of Tejpur. I don't take permission, I give permission. Learn the new rules as soon as possible, Sadhu Yadav. It will be good for you. I thought you were an intelligent man, SP. I've done a lot for your progress. I even sent a huge gift. But I was wrong. You are not worthy of my friendship. Everybody leave. I suspected this was Sadhu Yadav's doing. What is the SP doing? Sir, he has called Bachcha Yadav to his room. - Find out what is happening. - Sir. Sir. Didn't I tell you? Such people are not loyal to anybody. Sir... Inspector Bachcha Yadav. I want the full report and your statement. And until you give me that, you won't do any other work. - Hello. Yes. - Give the phone to Amit. Sir, it's the DIG. - Sir. - Amit, you did the right thing. This is what you should do with Sadhu Yadav. Bloody rogue. Sir, you... I just came to know about Sadhu Yadav's insult. Such things can't be hidden in the department. Anyway. What are you doing with Bachcha Yadav? Sir, it's difficult to say anything right now. I am conducting an inquiry. But be careful. The minister has praised you. If the truth of the Nonua case is exposed, then along with the department, his image will also be tarnished. - Sir. - Let Bachcha Yadav confess. Then I will tell you what to do. I will definitely talk if there is a need, sir. Sir, shall we give inspector Bachcha Yadav a memo from the office? - Do you want to give it? - No, sir. You prohibited him from working. DSP Burelal. I am doing whatever needs to be done with him. If I need you, I will tell you. - Sir, this... - I will see that. Sir. And listen. I don't like you giving DIG Verma the news of this place and coming into my cabin without my permission. - Keep that in mind. - Sir. - You may leave. - Sir. Greetings. - Greetings, Mr. Bachcha. - Greetings. Construction business is profitable. But this is not our cup of tea. Why don't you understand? Who is telling you to do it? You only finance it. I will have to do something about your SP. He interferes too much. - I wanted to talk to you, Brother Sunder. - What happened? Come. Sir is suspicious. He said it in front of Baba. My job will be in danger, Brother Sunder. So what? Baba was the one who got you the job, right? You don't worry. This SP won't stay here for long. Brother Sunder, what is he saying? I don't understand. He is right. Your money, my labor. It will be 50-50. - But Brother Sunder... - What he said is final. - Greetings, Sister-in-law. - Greetings, Sister-in-law. Come. He has been drinking since morning. Mangni. Why are you standing outside? Come inside. Why has he come? He has come with us. He wanted to talk to you. What will you say to me? I have lost my mind. I don't know whether my job is secure or not. No charge sheet. No duty. I have gone mad. What will you say? Now stop. How much will you drink? Don't lecture me. Bring three glasses. No, take away the glasses. Sister-in-law, make tea. What's the matter? The SP is not ready to listen. I will lose my job. Bachcha, only you can do something now. Stop this speech. Come to the point. Mangni Ram wants a transfer. Burelal had taken him to the DIG. - Mr. Verma has demanded Rs.2 lakh. - So? I have heard even you want a transfer. If you had told Sadhu Baba, then I too... That's why I don't talk to you. What do you think of me? Am I a pimp? I am a police officer. I am a police officer. If you are a police officer, then why do you work in fear? There is no peace of mind. Fear of the goons, fear of losing respect. Fear of the senior. There is danger in every task. Why do all of you do this kind of work? - Greetings. - Greetings, Brother Bachcha. - Where is Baba? - In the garden. Quickly do something. If this new SP stays here, he will create problems. - He is creating problems for our men. - Are you talking about Bachcha? Yes. Yesterday he had come to meet me. He was very angry. Let him die. He is my man. When will he come to my aid? You worry about your business. What about that PWD tender? Tomorrow at 4 o'clock. We will go. How are you, Bachcha Yadav? I have heard the SP sacked you. - Bachcha has come. - Come, Bachcha. How are you? Come. What happened? - Everything is fine, Baba. - What happened? - Why are you so tense? - Nothing will happen to you. I am there. Take this. If you need more, let me know. Take it. Enough, Baba. You have given me everything. Now, I don't want anything else. Greetings. Greetings, Sunder. I had kept it ready when I heard the car. Kesari, what's the tension in Bajaj Samiti Bhavan's tender? Nothing. The same old thing. Forming a union, they have filled the tender. To construct a building. Idiot. You have added so much limestone. You burned my tongue. Spit it, sir. I will get another one. Get lost. - You reach the PWD's office. - Okay. - It's time for the tender. - Okay. Silence. - Hey, quiet. Don't shout. - What are you saying? Why are you creating chaos? Listen. Remain seated. Open the tender. Tender. - Engineer. - Brother Munna, tell me. - Why are you screaming so much? - This engineer is talking about law. Union's tender is Rs. 27,56,500. And the other tender is... - And Sunder Construction... - Rs. 30,35,000. And the construction of the hall is given to Sunder Construction. Put the stamp. Look, this is not legal. Do what I have told you, Engineer. Otherwise I will not spare you. Understood? Look, I can't do this. You... Idiot. You can't do it. You can't do it. Tell me. Tell me. You can't do it. What were you saying? Tell me. Idiot. Come on. Since you have joined Tejpur, you have been acting smug. You talk about the law. You talk about the law. You talk about the law. Idiot. Can't you understand this simple thing? - You don't understand. - He is gone. You will give the tender to somebody else. You will rule Tejpur. Remember. Sunder Construction. Ravi Das. I had called you. I publish the newspaper. Tejpur Express. I have taken his x-ray. Left ribs are badly injured. Why did you refuse to give a statement to the police? It was an accident, SP. Now why file a complaint for that? Look, if you don't help the police, then... SP, nothing's wrong. I fell down from the stairs. Khan, arrange for his security. - And try to talk to him. - Sir. Look, whenever you want to talk or give a statement, come to me without hesitation. - Has the pain reduced? - Sir. These are not accident wounds. I want the right report. Sir. Editor, why are you working overtime? Let sir go. He has still not settled down properly. Burelal, he might not remain here for long. I want the report of all the cases against Sunder Yadav. Sir. I am Amit Kumar. The SP of this place. - Yes. - I have come to talk about your daughter. She is not here. - Where is she? - She has gone to our relative's house. My brothers are in Gujarat and Rajasthan. She has gone there. Do you know Sunder Yadav? No. I don't know any Sunder Yadav. I have not filed any complaint. - Why are you lying to sir? - I am not lying. I told you. I don't want to say anything. Please leave. - But... - Khan. There is no force. - Mother is lying. - Ravi! Mother is lying. I know, Ravi. But she is lying for you, not for herself. She is afraid that along with your sister, Sunder Yadav might... She is a mother. That's why she is scared. I have come to alleviate her fear. But she doesn't trust me. Will you bring my sister back? Surely. If your mother wants me to. You tell me what should I do? An alone and helpless woman. He took my daughter. He has threatened to kill him. What do I say about the police? Nobody from the community steps ahead. You just file the report. I will handle the rest. Fine. Hey, Bajrangi. Hey, Raghu. Lock the gate. Nobody should come in. Shut it. - Lock it. - Lock it. Lock the gate. Come on. Come on. - This Sharma will make things difficult. - I will inform sir. You call up the police station and tell Tiwari to send more force. Open the gate, Thakur. Don't create trouble. Sadhu Baba has not given us orders. Why is there so much drama at the gate? A new police officer has come. - What's the matter? - They are not opening the gate. What are you all doing? Arrest him. - Surround the place. - Go there. - Search and find Sunder Yadav. - Sir. I think you are in a hurry. - Look there. - Have a seat. Where is Sunder Yadav? You feign innocence. Will he sit here and wait for you? You gave the arrest order. And from your headquarters... I too received the news. Sir, he has escaped. Sorry. Your work couldn't be completed. But you have come to my house for the first time. At least, have tea. My wife makes nice tea. Who told you that I am leaving? My men will be here round the clock. Without their permission, you can't even move. Are you placing me under house-arrest? Now, you just wait and watch what I do to you. You won't be able to do anything, SP. Many people like you have come and gone. But they couldn't harm me. Don't be under that wrong impression, Sadhu Yadav. The day the need arises, I will drag you to the police station. And remember. Our tea is very bitter. We shall overcome We shall overcome We shall overcome some day Oh deep in my heart I do believe We shall overcome some day We shall overcome We shall overcome We shall overcome some day Oh deep in my heart I do believe We shall overcome some day We'll walk hand in hand We'll walk hand in hand We'll walk hand in hand Everyone, duck! Amit! - Nab him. He ran into that lane. - Amit! I'm okay. I'm fine. Close the shop. Close it. "TEJPUR SP WAS ATTACKED" - What will happen now, father? - I don't know, dear. Sir, please let me take action. My report is confirmed. The man was from outside the district. You are not on duty, Bachcha Yadav. Give your report to Tiwari. We will see that later. This is the matter of attack on sir. No need to get so impatient, Bachcha Yadav. Many able officers are working here. The department doesn't work just because of you. Understood? - Sir, then why don't you suspend me? - That is not in my power. Don't try to act smart. You are off duty. You may leave. Greetings. I had come to meet sir. He is asleep. Fine. Greetings. Come inside. - What's the matter? - I can't endure it anymore, sir. Sir, I can't live like this. Either court-martial me or give me a chance. Different people are asking me different questions. And I don't have a single answer, sir. I have made a mistake. But I am not a corrupt man, sir. I have always worked with pride. No one will be able to accuse me. Just give me one chance, sir. If you find any flaw in my duty, then sack me. Pick up the files. If you know that he is an corrupt man why don't you take any action? I'm taking a risk. I know that Bachcha Yadav is not bad from within. Can you trust him? I don't know. But I will surely give him a chance. Greetings. What's the matter, Bachcha? Is everything fine? The police have found out. Brother Sunder will have to leave immediately. Listen. You yourself go to Bhawanipur. - Take him across the border. - Okay, Baba. Greetings. - Is everything fine? - It's your grace. How long will you sit like this? Wear these clothes. Cheer up. Otherwise Sunder will not spare you. Wow, beautiful! Call her. I told you. I won't go! She says no. She says no? She won't agree like this! What's the matter? You are acting smart again. Look, I had organized such a grand feast for you! And if you don't come, it will be an insult. To Nonua and me. Tell me! Come! Come for some time. I told you... I won't go! Why? You foolish woman! You made me raise my hands. How many times have I told you that I love you? Live long. Leave me. Greetings. Inspector Bachcha Yadav has come. - Who else is with him? - He has come alone. Sir... Bachcha Yadav has come. I'll be back. You have come at the wrong time, Bachcha. You are right. The police have found out. The police can't do anything. Don't talk like a fool. The SP has been attacked. He himself has left with the special force from the division. Everybody will die a brutal death. We can't risk brother Sunder's life. Come. - How will we go? - We will take Peepra route from Bhairavan. - I will help you cross the border. - Are you mad? - No vehicle can travel on that route. - What is the need? My motorcycle is there. Hurry up! Don't worry. Bachcha is our man. You just take care of the girl. Fine? Come on! Stop! Stop! What is this? You said you will take the Peepra route. Dadua knows about that route. Can you trust him? He is a pimp. Anybody can bribe him. Anybody can be bribed. You can keep it with you. Today, I am finally being loyal. I don't care even if I die. Come on! Where have you brought me? I've arranged things at the mill. One of our men will leave in a truck. - They will help you cross the border. - Is that so? Idiot! Will you arrest me, SP? I will be released within 24 hours. It's my record. Understood? - You! Come here! - No! - Take him! - Come on! - Come on! - Come on! Bachcha! Well done! Sir, you gave me the chance. You trusted me. You risked your life. I am proud of you. Sir, you said this much... and I feel proud. - Where is that girl? - She is there. In Bhawanipur. Call her soon. Fine. But nothing should happen to my son. Calm down, Sadhu. And come to the point. Quote the price and send my son home safe and sound. Greetings. I am DIG Verma. I just came to ask you, do you have any problem? No. Everything is fine. Only my daughter is still missing. We will find her. You will just have to cooperate a bit. - I... - Those people are not good. Sadhu and Sunder Yadav. You withdraw your case. You will get your daughter. DIG, do you have any inkling of the hell that I have been through in these past three months? Now, even if my daughter returns... ...can you imagine what her future will be? I will never spare that monster! What will you do? Because of SP Amit Kumar, you are being so confident. But he will be transferred. And Sunder Yadav? He will get the bail soon. Then? You have lost your daughter. You will lose your son, too. Why are you talking like that to my mother? Son, don't say that! Tell them to leave, mother. If you want your daughter to be safe then change your statement. Keep a watch on her son. Yadav will be famous as long there are stars and moon! Hail brother Sunder! Yadav will be famous as long there are stars and moon! Have you written the application for remand? Yes. It has been submitted to the court. Everything is fine. Come. The one who will lock horns with us... - ...will be destroyed! - Come! Come! Hail Sunder! - Hail Sunder! - Come on! Move! Move! Hail Sunder! - What is this? - Your honor, already many charges are pressed against Sunder Yadav. In Bairoganj police station, CR number 37 by 98, 307, 147, 148 and in 149... Your honor, all this is baseless. Till now, the charge-sheet has not been filed in any of the cases. The police are investigating the matter. Your honor, 12 cases are pending against Sunder Yadav. And the investigation is still going on. When you have not completed the investigation in four-five years, then what will you do now? Under what charges has he been brought here today? Your honor, filed at the Tejpur police station is CR number 63 by 2002 case number 363, 376. This is a case of abduction of a minor girl, Apoorva and an attempt to rape her, Your honor. This is a lie, Your honor! In the police record, there is no mention of the date of the incident. The girl named Apoorva who is being mentioned lives in Gujarat with her relatives. Her mother herself has accepted this, Your honor. There might be a difference in the date of the incident and the FIR, Your honor. But Sunder Yadav is a criminal. Don't worry. Your daughter has come. Your son is in our safe custody. He has been threatening the girl's mother. Mother, where is Ravi? Whatever this woman is saying is a baseless accusation, Your honor. The police don't have any evidence or witness. And they are mentioning a date from three months ago. When was the FIR lodged? The girl's mother is here. Your honor, the FIR was lodged on 23rd May. And Apoorva's mother is here. - Sir, that girl is here too. - Who? Sir, Apoorva. Her daughter. She is right here. Have you lodged this FIR? Your Honor, ask her where her daughter is. Where is your daughter? Tell him where your daughter has gone. Where is she? My daughter has not gone anywhere, sir. She is here. Then this complaint? This FIR? Speak up! Look, you are wasting the court's time. Don't be scared. Your daughter has returned. Tell the truth. Even after enduring such humiliation, if you won't help the police, then the police will also lose faith in the people. - Look... - I don't want to say anything, SP. My daughter didn't go anywhere. I didn't file any complaint. Just let me go. Your Honor, stop SP Amit Kumar. He is provoking her to record the wrong statement. He has no right to misuse his power and position. Your Honor, I am not doing anything of that sort. If she turns hostile, then how will the police punish the culprit? I am only asking her to tell the truth. The truth is that since you have come to Tejpur, for some personal reasons you have been after my client Sunder Yadav. By filing a false report and FIR, you are harassing him. This is not true, Your Honor. The police are just doing their duty... I can see what is right and wrong, Amit Kumar. If you disturb the court's proceedings, I will charge you with contempt. - I apologize, Your Honor. - You better do! I warn the police for arresting people under false charges and for wasting the court's time. Please take note of that. Yes, Your Honor. The culprit is innocent. He is acquitted. Mother! Mother! Long live Sunder! Long live Sunder! Don't spare this traitor, son! I will give him a brutal death. Order me, Brother Sunder. I will kill him right here. Yadav will be famous as long as there are stars and moon! Hail Sunder! The one who locks horns with us will be destroyed! Everything is fine. Don't worry. Yadav will be famous as long as there are stars and moon! Hail Sunder! Yadav will be famous as long as there are stars and moon! Greetings, Mother-in-law! Brother Sunder! You have already started crying. You haven't even bid your daughter farewell yet. Look, take care of my darling. I will come soon. Bye. The police's job is to establish a peaceful atmosphere. If you all create a scene like this, it's not good. What was the need for this action? What did you achieve? The police's image was tarnished in the court. I am at the divisional headquarters. Ask me whom to arrest, what action to take. The minister praised you in front of everybody and you became smug. What about him? He just praised and went away. Here, we have to pay the price. Be careful in the future, Mr. Amit Kumar. Listen! Now do stop it, Amit. I have warmed the meal thrice, Amit. I'm not hungry. You eat. What is this, Amit? Why the enmity with food? Enmity. Whose enemy am I? You? This house? This society? That mother and daughter duo, or my department? Whose? Oh, no! I'm just doing my duty. The society is its own enemy. Criminals! All of them. All of them are cowards. That DIG Verma... He says work peacefully. Peacefully, my foot! My foot! He goes and threatens that old lady in the middle of the night. Sadhu Yadav's slave. He tells us to be practical. What enmity are you talking about? I'm not hungry. You have dinner. - Hello! Hello! Control room! - Yes! Over! Give me the report of patrol party number 357. Over. We have just received report that there is disturbance at Red Square area. Over. Control the patrol party. Over. Hello! Control room! Message for patrol party! Reach Red Square immediately. There is some disturbance. Over. Control room! Sub-inspector Pandey on the line. We have received the message. We are reaching Red Square. Over. Just now Munna Thakur, Kesari Dalal and Sadhu Yadav's men have left for Red Square. Over! - Finish him off! Don't spare him. - You speak against Sunder Yadav? What are you doing? What did I do? Don't spare him! Don't spare him! Get him down. Let's see who saves him. You idiot! You try to act smart! You idiot! You idiot! You... SP, what you are doing is not right. SP! SP, this is not right. This is not right. Sadhu Baba won't spare you. - Sir, shall we enter it in the diary? - No! Let them rot. We will see in the morning. Sir! What did you say in court, you idiot? What you heard, traitor. Bachcha Yadav, remember! Keep quiet, idiot! Idiot! Who are you abusing? - Who are you threatening? - Hey! Prashant! Open the lock-up! You idiot! - Open the door! - Open it! Open it! You! I won't spare you! Beat them! Hey, leave me. You... Beat him. Don't spare him. Catch him! Bachcha Yadav! You threaten me, idiot? What will you do? Kill him! It will end the problem! You threaten me, idiot! I will kill you! You threaten me? Open it! Open it! With acid! I will burn you! What is this? Gangajal! Today, I will purify Tejpur. Hold him! Hold him! Hold him! Hold him! Hold him! No! No! Help! Help! They both are so petrified that they can't speak. They won't be able to give any statement. Their eyes have been plucked with a sharp object and then burned with acid. - Who did this? - Nobody is saying anything, sir. I want names, not your silence. I am not going to tolerate this! I won't spare whoever has done this. I will take action! Understand? Which police officers are responsible for this? - Stop! - Stop! You can't go without saying anything, sir! It's your responsibility. You will have to answer. What answer do you want? Sir. the way you behaved with Munna Thakur and Kesari Dalal last night at Red Square, what can be the meaning... Don't guess anything. Investigation is still on-going. You will get the proper answer. This has happened in your police station, Tiwari. It's not good. Brother Sunder, I was off duty. Just tell me who all were involved in this. We didn't do this, Sadhu Baba. There were 12 other prisoners in the lock-up. They had a fight at night. The power supply went off too. - During that time... - Tiwari! Do you think I am a fool? Look! I am boiling with rage! Just tell me if Bachcha Yadav was there or not. What are you afraid of, Tiwari? I am here. None of us were there. How long will you remain safe, Tiwari? Only until Munna and Kesari record their statement after regaining consciousness. If you say anything, I will not spare you! I won't say anything, sir! Won't say anything! What did you see? What did you see? - Nothing, sir! - Nothing! And you? Don't utter anything! Understand! Understand! Don't utter anything! Why don't you speak, idiot? What happened? I will die but I will not say anything, sir! - "Won't say anything!" - Leave him, Tiwari! He is true to his words! If he won't say anything, somebody else will say. Hey, you! Nobody will say anything. If my job is ever at risk, I will deal with each one. Remember! Did you all notice one thing? Today, not a single FIR has been lodged at the Tejpur police station. No incidents. How will there be, sir? Everybody is scared of the acid. That's it. Don't open your mouth! Remember! Okay, sir. I will never forget last night's incident. Yes! I admit that the crime rate has reduced. But what justice is this that the police pierce people's eyes in the custody? Why? Many countries have the law of chopping off robbers' hands. What is happening in Tejpur is right. And now only this will happen here. INJUSTICE IN TEJPUR Did you see what is published? Tejpur's blind law. I think Ravi Das is determined to become a martyr. What are you all looking at? Give a betel leaf. Dear, I am going to interview the priest in Shahapur mosque. You look after... - Come out! - Come out, Tejpur Express! Editor! Open the door! I... - Stay here. - Don't spare him today. I will check it out! Open the door! What do you think of yourself? - You will get killed! - Come out! - This editor has gone mad! - Open the door! What rumors are you spreading, editor? - You will have to pay a huge price. - Rumor? - I am not... - Then are you writing the Ramayana? For the first time, the police have done the right thing. Still you have a problem. I publish the newspaper for you all. If you have any qualms about the news, then tell me. I will publish that too. But it is my duty and right to publish the right news. - How can you suppress it? - We will suppress it, editor! If you write anything against Amit Kumar again, then neither you, nor your newspaper will be spared! This is injustice. And publishing wrong news... Do you see what is going on? Why don't you tell your father to keep quiet? Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Beat him! Father! Stop! Now, we won't endure this charade. Remember! Your plight will also be the same. You will be in a bad state. So what if their eyes were plucked in the police station, Chaudhary? Robbery! Theft! Murder! They have ruined this area. You are unnecessarily thinking so much. Both of them are criminals. Law and order can't harm them. Take the decision here itself, Chaudhary. Why don't you people understand? Sir will fire me. How will he find out? Didn't you hear about Tejpur? Even Sadhu Yadav is scared. Now don't delay the matter, Chaudhary. Bring both of them outside. Why? Do it inside. - Beat them! - Come on! Beat them! Beat them! Beat them! - What are you guys doing? - Beat them! Beat them! Beat them! Let's go. Make me yours, darling! You will get what you want overnight! Hey, Neta! Leave her! - Leave me! - Did somebody say something? Neta! Neta! Hey! Nobody will come forward. Nab them! Don't spare them! Nab them! Nab them! Nab them! Stop! Hey! Neta! Beat them! I am sorry, sir. It was a mistake that your wife met with an accident. You can do anything you want to, sir. You can even chop me into pieces. But this is what will happen in Tejpur now. If anybody ogles at my sister, he will get only one answer. Acid! - Why are you taking the car down? - Sir, Shikarpur station is here. Don't stop here. Drive straight. Inspector! Inspector! Sir's jeep had passed. What are you saying? Why didn't he stop here? I don't know! But sir was in the jeep. I think there is some new problem. Shankar, bring the cap. Get the jeep out. Take the shortcut! Overtake sir. Nab them! Sir should not find them. - Okay! - Come on! Go there! His house is there. - Find out where their house is. - Yes, sir. - Where is it? - What? Who is it? Nab him! Hurry up! Bring him out. The police have arrived. What are you doing? Hey! - Sir, she is his wife. - We didn't do anything, sir. Tell her to stop crying. And ask her where they are. - Hurry up! - What are you doing? - What are you doing? Leave me. - Get up. There! Get rid of them! Chase them away. Come on! Hey! Nab them! Take them to sir. If you open your mouth, your entire family will be killed. - Understand! - Take them. Come on. Come on! Come on! Sir, you! What's the matter? - You people are not needed here. - Sir! Go to the police station! I will talk to you later. - Okay, sir! - Come on! What has happened? Sir, ask her. She is his wife. What will she say, SP? Ask me the deeds of these monsters. Do you see her? She is Pasuria. My daughter! Who are you? What are you saying? Keep quiet! Idiot! Hey! Talk respectfully in front of sir. Today, you are teaching me manners. Where were you when I got her married? Not a single policeman came. Sir, with great difficulty I got her married. And bid her farewell. I don't know how this sinner came to know. He stopped the procession on the route. And he killed seven people! He tied my son-in-law's hands and feet and stabbed him. And he raped my daughter in front of everybody. He drove the car on my son-in-law's body! She is lying, sir! - Keep quiet! Idiot! - Get lost! He deserved this, sir! This sinner won't get a place even in hell! Who did all this with you both? Why don't you both say anything? Nobody did anything, sir. He's been blind since a long time. Take them to Tejpur. We will talk there. - Okay, sir! - Come on! Come on! Sir, we didn't do anything. Sir! - Come on. - Don't take him. Why do you worry, Mr. Chaudhary? Everybody in Shikarpur is with you. Found out anything? Amit, found out anything? What? Who pierced their eyes and burnt them with acid? I am investigating the matter. Investigating? But how can they do this? Your police can do anything, is it? Even animals don't behave like this. Anuradha, try to understand. This was done with criminals. Their profession is murder, rape, robbery! Oh! So, people get the right to pierce the culprit's eyes! Wow! Stop it, Anuradha! I am not saying that this is right. What they did was wrong. And they will be punished for that. What action are you taking? I know what to do. I know my responsibility. You don't have to worry. The truth will be exposed. Munna Thakur and Kesari Dalal have given their statement. You all are accused of being responsible for the incident. I will take action! Do you have anything to say? Why don't you speak up? No, sir. We don't want to say anything. Chaudhary, this incident occurred in Shikarpur in your presence. No, sir. Check the FIR book. There is no entry about it. Sir, you had made the full inquiry. Sir, I am innocent. You are lying. No, sir! Record the statement of everybody living in Shikarpur. You too have written this in your statement. That Munna and Kesari were not in the police station that night. Sir, you had prohibited from making the entry in the dairy. So, you blinded all of them? Do you have any humanity? You all have committed a crime. And now you all are lying like cowards. I will make the inquiry myself. And on the basis of this, charges will be pressed against you all. Only God can help you now. It's a dog's life. Filled with shame and humiliation. If we don't do anything, the public rebukes us. If we do something, sir rebukes us. Criminals have more respect than us. They are not answerable to anybody. That is what I don't understand. An incident occurred in our police station. - We were... - What happened? Why are you getting nervous, Tiwari? You all back off. I will take sole responsibility. What will sir do? He will suspend me! Good! - Now, I can't endure this life anymore! - Wow! Great! We will erect a shrine for you in the police station. Martyr Bholanath Pandey! Why are you getting agitated? I have taken the decision. The statement is ready. I am going to give it to sir. But Bachcha, why you alone? Tiwari! I was the one who damaged their eyes. And I don't regret what I did. I have written everything. - Bachcha! - Bachcha, in haste... Enough, Khan! I have taken the decision! Now, I will handle whatever happens. - Hey! - He has gone mad! What's the matter? Why were you not answering the phone? What? Where is our son? Father! Your father has come! - Hey, shall I drop you from here? - Father! Mother! Son! Father! - Mother! - Why did you betray me? Idiot! Tell me! - Help! - Father! Idiot. - Help! - Tell me! - Help! - Father! Help! - Help! - Father! Stop! Help! Idiot, I considered you my brother! And you? Why did you do this with me? Tell me! I told you, idiot, I'd give you a brutal death! No! An eye for an eye. - Father! - No! Father! Father! Father! Let me see his face once! Leave me! Just once! Leave me! Let me see his face once! Leave me! What will I do now? What has happened? Send the body for post-mortem. Yes, sir! Use all the power. This time, he shouldn't escape. Nab him! Nab him! Hey! Come on! Come out! Come out! Put him in the jeep. Tell me, idiot. Where is Sunder? - I don't know. - Tell me. I don't know, sir. Tell me. Catch him. Nab him. Hey. What happened, sir? Idiot. Get up. Sir, I have searched everywhere. He has not come here. Where will he go? - Nab all his men. - Yes, sir. I want the... Sorry, I don't want it. And his four cronies too. Shut up, Burelal. What were you guys doing? Sir, we are searching everywhere. Sir, we are trying. - I mean... - What do you mean? There is still no news about Sunder Yadav and his four cronies. Go! And arrest Sadhu Yadav right now. - Now, he will tell us. - Actually... Didn't you hear? I want him at the headquarters right now. Sir! Don't come inside. It's full of smoke. What is going on, Amit? Leave. I have loads of work. Tell me! You all are sitting idly. Thrash them until they speak up. Thrash them black and blue. I want the whereabouts of Bachcha Yadav's murderers. Bring them back to consciousness and beat them again. Sir! You are not worthy of this light. - Bring him inside. - Sir! Where is Sunder? Where is Sunder? And where have you hidden these four? You people play hide and seek, SP. I do it openly. If you have the guts, arrest me. Sadhu is not afraid. You have still not seen fear, Sadhu. If Sunder is not found within 24 hours, then your condition is going to be miserable. What will you do? Damage my eyes? Kill me? You won't be liberated so easily, Sadhu Yadav. Remember, 24 hours. If anything happens to my son, there will be an explosion in Tejpur, DIG. Don't be immature, Sadhu! If Amit Kumar finds Sunder, then even I won't be able to do anything. Do as I have said. Surrender in court and then get bail. Send Rs.50 lakh to the district judge. Rs.50 lakh! He was demanding Rs.1 crore. I somehow managed to get it reduced by half. 50% should be delivered before 8 o'clock. Send the rest to me. I will send the money, DIG. But remember, there should be no problem in getting bail for my son. Let Sunder get bail. I will then tackle your crazy SP. Arrange for the money. Call me. What time did he say? He has left home. Must be reaching here. Idiot! He is acting smart. What's the matter, Sadhu Baba? Is everything okay? Forget that. There is not enough time. Quickly send Rs.25 lakh to the district judge. Rs.25 lakh! Sadhu Baba, at this time... Before 7 o'clock in the morning, it should be on his breakfast table. I am going to arrange for the rest. It's difficult, Sadhu Baba. I can't do it so quickly. What did you say? My son's life is at stake. I will do anything. Rs.25 lakh. District judge. Before 7 o'clock. Okay? Idiot! You? - Have you settled everything? - Yes. - Will everything be fine? - Yes. - It's getting late. - Yes. Where is he? Tea. Tea. Tea! Our turn is about to come. Where is Mr. Sunder? He will be here any moment now. Tea! Tea! Hot tea! Have some tea! Tea! Tea! Hot tea! Case number 107. Hey! Call after some time. Hey. Nab him. Nab him. Take him outside. Quickly. Leave me. Leave me. Leave me. Lawyer! Lawyer! Hey! Hey! Move. Everybody move. Hey, Lawyer. Move! Move! Stop them! What are you all looking at? Go! Lawyer, they took my son. Stop them. Now, nothing can be done until the police bring him here. That SP won't spare him! Why don't you understand? He will pierce his eyes. Mr. Yadav, the court can only do something when the matter is presented in the court. Scoundrel. Wake up. Scoundrel. Scoundrel. You will crave for slumber. This is Holi! The police have kept Sunder Yadav thrice under custody for 12 days, Your Honor. What kind of investigation is this? It never ends. No charge sheet has been filed. There is no evidence, no witness. The police have not even presented the list of things found at the crime scene in the court. Look at my client's plight, Your Honor. The police have taken his statement seven times. Now nothing is left for him to say. Nothing. Your Honor, our investigation is going on. Your Honor, my client's life is in danger in police custody. Anything can happen to him. Bail can't be granted under these sections. The culprit is sent for ten days in police custody. - And quickly file the charge sheet. - Sir. - Yes. - What is this? - It... - I will handle the matter. Greetings, sir. How are you? Forgive me. I had proved you a liar in this court. Every day I'd tell mother, "Let's go and meet the SP." What are you saying? Don't I understand your helplessness? Found a guy for her? Get her married soon. Sir, don't spare Sunder Yadav. Hail the SP. Hail Tejpur police. Hail the SP. Hail Tejpur police. Hail Tejpur police. Hail the SP. Hail Tejpur police. - Tell him to leave. - Hey. Come on. Hail the SP. What were you taught in school yesterday? - English. - Which lesson? Manasi. He has come. Manasi. Jai Hind. - Greetings, sir. - Greetings, SP. Have a betel leaf, sir. It's special. I don't chew betel leaf. Sir, it's cooling. It will refresh your mind. Have it. - Hurry up. Sir is leaving. - Yes. Hot tea. Sir, he is Mangni Ram's son. Sir, Honest tea vendor. Taste it, sir. I have made it with thick milk. And I sell it at the cheapest rate in the market, sir. He is my second son, sir. The first one comes at night. And the second one in the morning. It is our family business, sir. I do it diligently and honestly. Then when do they go to school? What will they do going to school, sir? If they study, they won't work. Sir, taste the tea. On one condition. Send both your children to school. And from tomorrow, you resume duty. Sir. It's good. Leave me. It is no longer in my hands. Quickly do something. Otherwise it will become difficult to even spend time in remand. I have heard that even Gangajal... DWARKA RAI HOME MINISTER Look, sir. DIG, you are great. You have made such a thick file and you didn't inform me. Sir. Sorry, sir. - But you had praised him, so... - That is what I regret. SP Amit Kumar. Who do you think you are? I recommended your name for the President's gold medal. And you have put my job at risk? I regret what happened in Tejpur, sir. But I am myself investigating each incident. Very soon... That is the problem. I don't understand. Why are you making this mistake repeatedly? Your formula of reducing crime. Moreover, this investigation. Why are you causing problems? Who will be humiliated? Tell me. What will you lose? You will get a transfer. I will be ruined. Minister, stop your speech. And do my work. I am doing it. Look, stop this investigation immediately. When people are not complaining, why are you raking up the past? Get Sunder Yadav's bail. - What? - His life is in danger. Every day they are threatening to damage his eyes. Why are you interfering? I am talking to him. Look, get him bail. And report to me. Didn't you hear? Sunder's hearing is tomorrow. He should get bail. Sorry, sir. Sunder Yadav can't get bail. Why? What's the problem? Because he killed inspector Bachcha Yadav. Then name a price. Tell me. What do you want? You don't have the ability to pay Bachcha Yadav, Sadhu Yadav. By the way what have you given to the minister? - Mr. Amit Kumar. - Sir, please. You can do whatever you want. But Sunder Yadav won't get bail as long as I am here. I won't spare you, SP. Sit. Sit. Sit. Please sit. Mr. Sharma, sit down. It's a blatant case of human rights violation, Minister. Sit down, gentleman. Let me explain. I know that injustice has been done with Tejpur public. But Amit Kumar was your favorite officer. You have even recommended his name for the President's medal. Look. I want peaceful ambience. But not at this price. But what action is the government taking? I will tell the High Court authorities to investigate this matter thoroughly. Until then, all the five dishonest policemen have been suspended. And Tejpur's SP has been sent on leave immediately. The commission report will be presented to the government within a month. What is the meaning of a leave? It means I can't go to the office. I can't work. I am off duty. What's going to happen now, Amit? Nothing. There will be a commission inquiry. My statement will be recorded and then, we will leave this place. Will you still be in the police force? Why? Are you afraid? No. Not anymore. Break the door. - Old lady. - Mother. Who is it? Forget the SP. Now let me see who saves you people. Hey. Break the door. Break the door. Break the door. - Hey, old lady. - Oh, God. Break the door. - What is going on? - Let's go and see. Hey. Hey. Move. Move. Break the door. Who are they, Sister? Move. Move. Move. Move. Causing a riot. Hurry up. Leave from here. Hey. Move. How long will you hide your daughter? Listen to me carefully, old lady. If you betray Sunder, you will be ruined. Move. Move. Move. Move. Come on. This had to happen. "The letter is written in blood. Don't think it's ink." "I swear if you get Apoorva married to anybody else" "I will ruin your family." "That Ghaziabad's old man will not descend" "on Tejpur platform alive." "Apoorva is mine. She will remain mine." "I will abduct her at all costs." "Remember my name, Sunder Yadav." I must have committed some sin. That's why I gave birth to this trouble. Even if she had died, I would have not mourned. Is this the way to rebuke your daughter? Please sit. What do I do, SP? With great difficulty this alliance has been fixed. If my daughter loses her honor, nobody here will care for her. I have found a man. So what if he has two children? He has his own shop in Ghaziabad. What can I do if she is destined for this? Did you go to the police station? Now who will listen to me there? If you are not there... It is not so. The police will do their duty. - Don't do anything. Understood? - Yes. - Tejpur police station. - Who is the duty officer? - Sub-inspector Mangni Ram, sir. - How are you, Mangni? How would I be without you, sir? Listen, I had called because Roopmati's daughter - Apoorva is getting married. - I know, sir. - This wedding should not be called off. - It won't, sir. Good night, sir. Good night. Don't get trapped in this maze, Tiwari. The Inquiry commission will be very powerful. That's why I have come to you. Erase my name from the report somehow. The DIG is handling the matter. Only he can do something. We won't let you do this, sir. There will be a rally. We will riot. The Government's decision is wrong. They will have to change it. The public has now awakened, sir. You will get full support. You too just support us. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. Long live Amit Kumar. TEJPUR EXPRESS ACCUSED IN EYE PIERCING CASE PRESENTED IN COURT Amit. Everything will be fine, Anu. Inspector Shahid Khan, do you accept the charges against you? No, Your Honor. I am innocent. Inspector Bholanath Pandey. I am innocent, sir. Inspector Neelkanth Tiwari. I am innocent, sir. Constable Ramrat Singh. Innocent. Constable Prajapati Mishra. Innocent. Superintendent of Police, Amit Kumar. Do you accept the charges against you? Yes, Your Honor. I accept the charges. Do you consider yourself the culprit? What's happening? Yes, Your Honor. As Tejpur's Superintendent of Police, I take responsibility of everything that has happened. Mr. Amit Kumar, do you want to appoint a lawyer for your defense? No, Your Honor. I don't need a lawyer. You all file your answers. The proceedings will continue. Sir, we want to talk to you. Sir! Sir, our lives are at stake. It's useless, Pandey. You all do what you think is fine. I won't change my mind. We all will be ruined. Why do you all worry? Just his accepting is futile. There won't be a single witness. Nothing will be proved. You have come. Son, today I will take you anyhow. What's the matter? Aren't you happy? She's getting married today. And Father, if I don't get bail today, I will break out of prison. Today nobody will stop your bail. Come on, dear. Sunder Yadav. You can't go inside as long as I am here. Keep quiet. Move. Or else I will get you suspended. Hey. I will shoot if anybody moves. Move. - Come. - Hey. What are you doing? - What are you doing? - Help. You couldn't wait. You were in haste to get her married. - Come. - Somebody help. Leave her. Leave my sister. - Leave me. - Ravi. Mother. Leave her. Leave her. Leave her. - Leave her. - Leave. Sir, this is Mangni Ram speaking. Sunder Yadav has come here. Sir, come here quickly. Hey, Mangni. What are you doing here? Sir, it's terrible. Sunder Yadav is abducting the girl. Come, sir. Why are you worrying? I had sent you on duty to Red Square. - Save her, DSP. - You don't worry. You leave. You will get your share. Nobody come forward. Don't be immature, Mangni. Don't be mad. Stop it, DSP. Even a witch is better than you. You... - Hey, Mangni. - Shut up! - Hey. - Hey. Come. Come on. Leave my daughter, you monster. Leave her. Old lady. Mother. Mother. Mother. Mother. - Mother. What happened to you? - Get up! - Get up. Come on. - Mother. - Mother. - Come. Have you gone mad? You will cut your hand. What are you doing? I should have done this a long time ago. Don't come ahead. Don't come ahead. - Having great fun. - Careful. In this drama. Quietly see my destruction. I am nobody's sister. I am nobody's daughter. - Wait! - I am just a stigma. A stigma. Stop this drama. You will cut your hand. Hey. Oh, God. Hey, you ruined everything. You ruined everything. Hey. Move. Move. Father. Dear, don't be stubborn. Let's leave. Come. I say come with me. Come with me. Come with me. - Father, I... - Come. Move! Take them. No need to take them anywhere, SP. The decision will be taken here itself. Yes. Yes. - Sir, leave it on us. - Yes. SP, you just don't interfere. - Today we will finish them here itself. - Yes. Yes. - We will pierce their eyes. - Yes. Yes. Beat them. Beat them. Beat them. Move. I say move back. Move. Move. Beat them. Beat them. Beat them. Hail Mother Ganga. Bring the acid. Stop. Stop all this. I say stop all this. Stop. Don't spare them. Beat them. Hail Mother Ganga. Now we won't spare them. Don't stop us. What are you all doing? Have you all gone mad? Yes, sir. We have gone mad. And today we will purify Tejpur with this Gangajal. You all are sick. Calling this acid Gangajal. You all tarnish its sacredness. You all have forsaken the norms of the society and your humanity. Because of this acid. What do you all think? It will liberate you all. Will Tejpur's land become pure? No matter what. Today we won't spare them. Yes. Yes. Come to your senses. Don't forget that it's our duty to hand over the culprits to the law safely. Sir, whose safety are you talking about? They murdered Bachcha Yadav. They are monsters. Will you save them? Khan, I am not saving them. I am saving the people from becoming monsters. Damaging the eyes with acid is not the norm of our society. But there is no power in our norms and rules, sir. They will go scot-free. The law is not weak, Bansi. We are weak. For our means we have made it corrupt. Otherwise you wouldn't make people who take bribes, practice illegal means and spread terror, your hero and your leader. And remember. As is the society, so will the police be. Even policemen are like you all. Selfish... And weak. We have to get rid of that weakness, SP sir. When the people of Tejpur have decided the fate of this father-son duo, why are you interfering? Because your decision is wrong. If, forgoing humanity and law, you all will take the decision on the basis of violence, then this will be dictatorship. The matter will not stop at making culprits blind. In the future, every right voice raised will be suppressed. Everything will be ruined. These culprits are in my custody. And what I do with them... will be within legal boundaries. If anybody stops me from doing my duty, I will take strict action against him. Move. Move. Move. Move. Take them. Amit. I will shoot. - Stop. - Amit. - Don't let them escape. - I will shoot. Nab them. Don't let them escape. This way. What are you doing? What are you doing? Let's leave. Lock it up, lock it. There. - Move. Move. - Move. Father! Hey. Stop. - Father. - Come on. Don't take a step ahead. Move. Otherwise I will kill her. Hey. No conclusion was drawn from the long commission inquiry and the testimony of many witnesses. In the end, all the accused policemen were acquitted. No matter what the truth of Tejpur was, Amit Kumar knew his truth. He never renounced that.
