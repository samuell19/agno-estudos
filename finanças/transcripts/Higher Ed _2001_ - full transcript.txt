Tell you about him later. Mr. Orange Jumpsuit, well, that's Sádico. His name means sadistic in Spanish. And they're both looking for me. - Did you message Angelito? - That's the word on the streets, Sádico. - Good. And what's the name of the university, Papi? - We don't know, but we're gonna find out. - (speaks in foreign language) You'll find out. Find out! (head thuds) Find out! Fine, find out!

Let's just say, I needed a change in scenery. (bus engine rumbles) Why? Well, here's what happened. I was low-level, a pharmaceuticals agent, working for Sádico, and like any good sales person, I had to try out the product before selling it to my customers. Well, one of those fools snitched on me, and Sádico threatened me with a banana. - You work for me, cojon, okay? - [Ed] But instead, he decided to transfer me to another position within the company, the Claims Department. (shuffling) - Don't you dare touch me! (female screams) - [Ed] As I rose through the ranks, others weren't so lucky. (speaks indistinctly and speaks in foreign language) (snaps fingers) - Banana. - Banana, brought it. (male whimpers) - Not the banana, Sádico? (male continues whimpering) - This'll teach you never to steal from Sádico.

(Yolanda sighs) Man, it was like love at first sight, like that movie "Sleepless in Seattle". - Hey, something wrong with your eyes, Moreno? - [Ed] Yeah, you guessed it. (Yolanda moans) Your boy was about to take a trip down the Love Canal. - Come on, take me. - No, come on, come on. And she was drivin' the boat. Come on, come on! Slow down, slow down, please. - Take me now. - Listen, listen. (Yolanda moans) No, no! (smooching) But it turned out to be the "Titanic". - Find him.

So I had to bounce. - Wake your ass up! You ain't gonna be nothing. All you hip-hop, hippy-hop, whatever you call yourself! Hell, all that education ain't gonna amount to be nothing! - What's wrong with you, man? - What the hell's wrong with... What the hell's wrong with you? I'm just an angry black bus driver, that's what the hell's wrong with me! Damn hip-hop hippety, get off my bus. (bus engine rumbles) (footsteps clomping) What the hell is that? (bus horn honks) (engine rumbles) - So I was ready to leave my past behind for good. Some place those gang bangers would never think to look. I enrolled in college. To tell you the truth, I wasn't even supposed to make it this far. See, I'm the first one in my family to go to college. (camera shutter clicks) I won a track scholarship.

Now, I hope that most of you have reviewed the Syllabus, and have gotten the 33 books needed for this course.

(phone rings) Your high school coach is a good friend of mine. We were in the Olympics together, and that is the only reason why you are within smellin' distance of this university. - But- - But nothin'! You shut your mouth, son. If I even get the feeling that you are messin' up, I am on your ass! Do I make myself clear? That question was rhetorical. (Coach farts) Now, our program is one of the best in the country. (Coach farts) Do you know why? (farting continues) Answer me, goddammit! - No, sir. - Then I'll tell you why. (Coach farts) It's because of discipline, Mr. Green. Now I hear that you have some talent for short sprints, but little discipline. Now, we wanna win at nationals this year, and with your help, I think we're gonna get there. Now, why don't you go out and meet the rest of your team?

He's either doin' this, - I'm just telling you. - or he's doing that. You are always hatin'. Why? - Hatin'? - That's right. - Oh, let's not. (Lisa scoffs) - Look, he's popular, okay? And half these girls out here would jump at the first chance to be with him, so I'm just... I don't wanna hear all this gossip. - You know what? You're just my girl, and I'm just looking out for you.

You know, learning about mating rituals in the wild, exploring exotic mammals, observing and appreciatin' their behavior. That's right. That's what my college experience was starting to look like.

And clean up this nasty room. - I was gonna eat that. - I know exactly what y'all thinking. (whimsical tones) - Do you, Ed Green, take Lisa Banner to be your lawful- - Yo, son, son, son, son, you gotta hurry up, man. This a fantasy. - Oh, well, then you may kiss the bride. (record scratching) ♪ I wanna touch your ass ♪ ♪ I wanna feel your g-string ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ ♪ I wanna touch you baby ♪ ♪ Oh ♪ - Yo, yo, you messin' up my fantasy, dude. You ain't even supposed to be here.

Y'all ain't from around here, are you? - No, sir, Italy (chuckles). - I see. (indistinct radio chatter) Well, I don't know what the speed limit is down in Italy, but us here in this state like to keep it at a respectable 60 miles per hour. Driver's license, please? (police radio chirps) (indistinct radio chatter) Italians too? - Yes, sir. - Sanchez, now that's a nice, respectable Italian name. - Yeah (laughs). (police radio chirps) (indistinct radio chatter) (police radio chirps) - Okay, put the guns under the seat.

Yeah, I got the chronic you sent me. Matter of fact, it's right here in front of me. (inhales deeply) Yeah, I smoked a little bit earlier, but yeah, my roommate, he had a whole blunt to himself. Why? What? Laced with angel dust? Man, how you gonna send me the wrong goddamn bag? Yo, that's some foul ass shit of you, man! - Mr. Green, leave (voice echoes). - Leave (voice echoes)? - Hey, bomboclaat, (voice echoes).

(intense dramatic music) (Ed yells) (quirky instrumental music) (Ed continues yelling) (quirky instrumental music continues) - You gave me some angel dust? - Look, man, what happened was, the guy that sold it to me, he told me- - I know what happened. I'm failing all my classes 'cause of you, man, My head is hurtin'. Yo, I played myself runnin' around the campus half butt-naked humpin' the ground. Man, what kinda crazy madness is that? - Look, I'm sorry, man (scoffs). - Look, I didn't come here for this kinda stuff. I'm trying to get my life together. - Look, I'm apologizin', Ed, man. It was a mix-up. - Look, you hittin' me with some jah breezy right now. You're mix-up. I can't mess with you no more. I don't want no more your weed. No more advice. I don't even know how I let you influence me like that. - I'm sorry, Ed. It was just a mix-up. (intense rock tones) (uptempo mellow music) - [Ed] So the square root of pi... Okay, so if we divide 49... Okay, okay, hold on. So 93 divided by 78, the calculus of the geometry... Ah, man, ah. Wait a minute. Hold up, hold up. (sighs) This is hard, man. School is hard, and all this smokin' ain't helpin' either. Okay, now, et me try this. Oh, 40... Okay, you know what? Let me just try to keep it simple. Three plus two... Damn. I really need to open up a math book. Hold on. Three plus one is six minus one. (whimsical tones) - What are you having tonight, cowboy? (upbeat hip-hop music) (dramatic slurping) (upbeat hip-hop music continues) (indistinct chattering) - What's up, y'all? My name is Pretty Ed. - [Both] We're just chilling, waiting on you. - Both of y'all? - [Both] Yeah, we're twins. - My name is Raven, and this is... - Ravena. - Raven, Ravena, this is my lucky night, huh? - [Both] You're even luckier, 'cause we're Siamese. - Whoa, Siamese? - [Both] And you wanna know where we're connected at? - Where? - We share the same- (alarm clock beeps) (button clicks) (upbeat hip-hop music) (indistinct chattering) - Yeah, yeah, yeah (laughs)! THat's that shit, boy! Damn, Ed! I gotta say, man, I'm pretty surprised by your sudden change in attitude, bro. - Yeah, man, you know, I'm a take your advice, and just withdraw from class early, so there won't be no penalty. - That's right. And, you know, if you do it before the deadline, won't even show up on your GPA. It'd be like startin' next semester fresh (laughs). - Yeah. - Give me a U. (both inhaling) - U! (both sighing) - [Team] P-S-U-U! - Your sister a virgin? - What? (whistle trills) - Yo, I didn't- - Look, man, I know what you meant, man! - I was just asking- - No, no, no, no, don't ask, all right? Look, man, she's a senior, so you know what that means. - What? - She's out your league, bruh. (whistle zipping) See that cat right there? That right there is my future brother-in-law. See, that's the black Superman. He don't drink. He don't smoke. I don't even think he curse. (object boings) - Pussy motherfuckin' shit! (Craig yells indistinctly) You cock motherfucker piece of... (spring boinging) Dumb fuckin' shit! Mother fuck you! - Better scratch that part out. You know what your problem is, man? You are a weedhead. My sister, she don't mess with no weedheads. (dramatic instrumental music) (indistinct chattering) (whimsical tones) (phone ringing) (whistle zipping) (footsteps shuffling) (indistinct chattering) (phone continues ringing) - Thanks a lot. - I'd like to register for school, please. - Register? - Yes, ma'am. - Would that be matric or non-matric? - I no try to trick you, lady. - And who might they be? - My tutors. - Well, of course. You have to give me a transcript of your high school diploma. (Angel laughs) - I didn't go to high school, lady. - You never attended high school but you wanna register for college classes? - Yes. (dinging) (indistinct chattering) - Oh, shit! - Hey, yo, what the hell's wrong with you? - Yo, that's my coach, yo. Don't move. - I thought you said you quit the track team? - I did, I just didn't tell him yet. So what he's doin'? (whistle trills) - Oh, shit. Yo, Ed, man, he's lookin' over this way. - Where exactly do you think we could put that new time clock comin' in next week? - I was thinkin' somewhere along the top up there. - Yo, yo, yo, son, he's startin' to point up here at you too. - A little to the left, perhaps? - Yeah, about there. That should be fine. - And you even got the other coach pointin' up here too. - Damn! - Why don't we ask some of these friends? They should have some idea. - That's a good idea. - Hey Craig, come over here for a minute. - Give me a T. - T! - Give me an S. - Where do think that new time clock should go? (Craig sniffs) (interposing voices) - [Craig] There would be nice. - They got the whole team pointin' at ya. If I was you, I'd just go face the music, but that's just me. - Yeah, what do you think? - All right. (bleachers clang) I am ready! Man, I'm sick and tired of you tryin' to bash me! I quit! I quit! - He quits! (whimsical tones) (uptempo sultry music) (bag clatters) - [Ed] Hi. - Oh, hi. You're my brother's roommate. - Ed. - Right, Ed. (Lisa giggles) - I don't mean to bother you, but I noticed we're taking the same class. - Oh, really, you're studying the classics too? - Oh, yeah, no doubt. - Oh. - Yeah. - Oh (giggles). Funny, I don't remember seeing your face in class? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no. I'm in the class after yours. - Oh. - See, I noticed you when you come out the class. - Oh, great. - Yeah, yeah. - Maybe you and I can study tomorrow? (scoffs) Dante's "Inferno" is kicking my butt. - Dante Informal? What a coincidence. That's my favorite book. (Lisa laughs) - (coughs) Inferno. - Oh, you readin' that one too? That's the one about the fire. The movie, (whistles) off the meat rack. (Lisa laughs) - Okay, Ed. - Yeah. - I'll see you tomorrow. Tomorrow, Ed. - Oh, yeah. - See you tomorrow. Okay? (uptempo sultry music) (dramatic tones) - Yo, she said she'd be here in half an hour. - So? - So I can't read this whole book in half an hour. - Oh, that definitely sounds like a problem, man. You need to try some of this chronic. - No, I'm cool, man. - You sure? - Shh, shh, shh, I'm straight, trust me. - That just means there's more for me. (Bud sniffs intensely) I'm going to get high as a motherfucker (laughs). Yo, man, this is just in case you change your mind later, and wanna think clearer. - Hey, yo, Bud? Let me ask you a question. - Yeah, go ahead. - What you doin' in here? - Talkin' to you, man. - Nah, I mean college. I mean, why are you not in the real world, you know, gettin' your hustle on? - This is my hustle, baby. (upbeat hip-hop plays over the radio) - You call this a hustle? - It is for me. Man, I register for class every year. You know what I'm sayin'? I got a place to sleep where I don't get charged no rent. I get all the food I want, three square meals a day. I got a beautiful view of the gardens and roses outside. I get all the girls I want. Plus, I meet new and exciting people every single day. What more do I need? - But what about the real world? - The real world is what you runnin' from, remember? - Well what about classes, you know? You know, I've actually been givin' that some thought. So I decided to join the Debate Team. - The Debate Team? (lighter flicks) (knocking at door) Oh, shit! (door clatters open) - Hi. Listen, Ed, I just found out the exam's not on Dante's "Inferno". Professor Hegg changed it to Plato's "Republic" at the last minute. - Damn. Sorry to hear that. - [Bud] I love you, little sis! - Love you too, Bud. Anyway, I was hoping maybe you had read that one too? - Nah, I'm sorry. But don't worry, classics happens to be my thing. (Lisa scoffs) - Okay, well, what the hell. I can use all the help I can get (chuckles). Okay, (giggles) great. So we'll meet by the Martin Building in a couple of hours? - I was just about to say that. Yeah. (Lisa giggles) - Okay. Bud, did you call mom? - Yeah, I tried to call her yesterday, but the line was busy. She ain't paid the bill. (Lisa scoffs) - I'll see you later. - [Ed] No, I'm not gonna do it. - It's a medical fact smoking chronic makes you smarter, and helps your memory (voice echoes). - Here goes nothin'. (lighter flicks) (upbeat hip-hop music) (uptempo hip-hop music) - I'm tired of all this cleaning, Papi. - Me too, man. Me too. (Angel speaks in Spanish) - Keep cleaning. (uptempo hip-hop music continues) (leaves rustling) (keys jingling) (intense dramatic music) (Sádico speaks in Spanish) - [Guard] Sanchez, phone call. - Ciento. (Sádico thuds) (Sádico grunts) (footsteps clomping) (intense dramatic music continues) - Yeah, this is Sádico. - We found him, Sádico, but there's a lot of people around. - What do you expect? It's a college! - Look, I know, I know, Sádico. But this is gonna take a little time to get him alone. - I don't care, just find him! - Shit! (Angel speaks in Spanish) Sorry- (door thuds) (Sádico speaks in Spanish) - [Sádico] Angel? - I've been lookin' for you new guys for the last 20 minutes. I didn't send you to this building. I said, the Webster Building. Oh, oh, y'all need it in Spanish. Webstero. Why you lookin' all confused and shit for? Come on. The third floor bathroom needs mopping, get to hoppin'! ¡Ándale! I've been to Mexico! ¡Ándale! (intense dramatic music) I'm gonna have to break my foot off in somebody's ass before the day is over. (Sádico speaks in Spanish) (Sádico grunts) (phone crunching) (groaning) (alarm blares) (phone clatters) - Get down! (Sádico mumbles indistinctly) - So what it seems Plato is trying to say here, is that Aristotle really isn't responsible for corrupting the minds of the youth. No more than we can be held responsible for other people's actions. - Right, right. Plato, minds of the youth, corruption, thrill her like Michael Jackson, look so lovely at Petty State Urban University. (Lisa laughs) Yeah. Yeah. - Let's see what's in this chapter. - [Ed] Yeah, yeah. (uptempo sultry music) (pages rustling) (uptempo sultry music continues) - Everything okay? - Oh, yeah, yeah. Everything's just groovy. (Lisa laughs) (uptempo sultry music continues) So what's up with Super Nigga? - Who? - You know, big man on campus hatin' on me? - First of all, he's my boyfriend. And second, he's good to me, so I'm not lookin' for anybody else, if that's what you're getting at? - I'm not hatin'. I'm just saying, you know, you can't judge a book by its cover. All that glitter isn't gold, you know? In other words, fuck the nigga. (Lisa gasps) Damn, did I say that? I'm sorry. - Have you been smoking weed, Ed? (Ed chuckles) Now that you say that, yeah, you know, I smoked a little just to kinda like help my memory. - Your memory? - Yeah. Little Bud said, it's scientific. (Lisa scoffs) - If that were the case, Bud would have the memory of a high-tech computer. - Hold on, wait, where you going? - In case you haven't noticed, I'm leaving. - Why? - You have a chance to do something with your life. Instead, you're choosing to smoke it all away? I hate to tell you this, Ed, but the real ghetto you're trying to get away from, it's in your head. (gentle instrumental music) (whimsical tones) - Yeah, I pretty much hit rock bottom. I mean, I'm failing all my classes. I lost a chance at the girl of my dreams. I mean, what else could go wrong? (audience applauds) - Our next debater is Mr. Bud? (Bud chuckles) (imitates howling) (clears throat) (smooching) (patting on back) - Excuse me. What's happenin', man? (Bud grunts) (paper rustling) (Bud chuckles nervously) (clears throat) (ethereal instrumental music) (clears throat) Before we begin this debate today, I'm going to let all of you know that I'll be saying some things that'll be changing the lives of every American in this room. Whether you're a black person or a white person or an old person or a young person, we find ourselves victim to the same type of hypocrisy here in America. - [Male Audience Member] Preach, brother! - Now, I'm telling you, brothers and sisters, this hypocrisy has told both you and I that it's not okay to smoke. Well, I smoke. I smoke every day. And I'm telling you, the people that say this to you are the media, the television. If you break down the word television, you can see the hypocrisy, tell lies and vision. Tell lie vision. Do you see the - Preach, brother! - hypocrisy that I am trying to get at? - Preach, brother! Preach, brother! - All right, brother (laughs). - Preach, brother. - All right. See, this is what I am talking about. This is the very thing that I am talking about. This brother's ragiosoty. If he had a blunt, and knew how to crack it open, put the weed down the middle, lick it, light it, smoke it, and pass it, he wouldn't have this type of ragiosity. - [Male Audience Member] Tell the truth! - That's right, brother. Puff, puff, and give, give. That's the rules to the game. And I am telling you, the only way to fight this system that is holding back our puffing enjoyment, the only way to fight this system, and I say again, - Yeah, brother! (Bud laughs) - is brothers listening. All right, any day. The only way to fight this type of rhetoric is to get yourself a blunt, lick it, light it, puff it, pass it by any means necessary. (audience applauds) - Asalamalakim. - And I love the Lakers. (buzzer buzzing) (cell door clatters) (feet squeaking) (indistinct chattering) (chains clanking) - Hi, Sádico. You sent for me? - That's right, little sis. Good news. We found him. - You found him? - Nobody does this to my little sister and lives. (intense dramatic music) I love you, mommy (voice echoes). (intense dramatic music continues) (audience applauds) - Therefore, (clears throat) legal scholars are expressing concern. (triumphant instrumental music) The applause is a bit premature. Thank you, but let me just finish, please. (door clatters) - Will you hurry up, Dean. I'm trying to win a journalism award, and you're just lagging behind. - I've got 200 pounds of equipment. (tapping at window) - [Brenda] Roll it down. Hey, Detective Dabias, I don't mean to bother you, but are you undercover? - Not anymore, honey. - [Male] Damn. - PSUU is a very prestigious university... - [Group] Puff, puff. - With an impeccable reputation for excellence. - [Group] Puff puff. - I can assure you, that there are no drugs on this campus. - Damn, this shit is blazin'. (female coughs) West Side! (upbeat hip-hop music) - Yo, man, you think we're addicted to this shit? I mean, do you think we should quit? - Addicted? Come on, man. Everybody know you can't get addicted from weed. This ain't like crack or nothin'. Besides, if I wanted to stop, I could right now, today even. - Really? (inhales sharply) - Or next week. (both laughing) (imitates dog barking) - [Brenda] So Mr. Withers, you've been working here on campus for how many years? - Let's see now. Since my sixth, no, fifth wife. That was Bernadine. I was married to Ola Mae, Ismae, Eliza Mae, Bertha Mae. (electronic static) - [Brenda] How many years have you worked here? - Oh. Oh, oh, oh, yeah. I've been probably working here since my last... What was that, number what? Number five, my fifth wife, Lula Mae. Yeah, yeah, she was some of that big girl too. A little big girl. Had a lot of dying problems. (electronic static) What was your question? - [Brenda] Have you seen anyone smoking marijuana? - No, no, I have no idea. In fact, I've never even touched... I've never, never touched the stuff at all (sniffing). So (sniffing) I don't even have any idea. I mean, (sniffing)... Really (laughs), I don't know (sniffs). - [Brenda] Right. Perhaps there's other drugs on campus that you would be more aware of? - Like what? (footsteps clomping) Detective Dabias, what exactly is going on here? - That's 100% marijuana. - Fabulous. Get this. - Yeah, that's what we've uncovered here right under the noses of the university. My, these have gotta be the biggest, old plants I ever busted. - [Brenda] Detective, do they know if it's faculty or students? - Oh, I can't give you any more information, dear, but I can tell you one thing, he's close. We're getting closer every day to solving this case, and we're gonna arrest this perpetrator. Ma'am I can't tell you too much right now, but I can tell you that those, these things are ready for harvestin'. Mm-hmm. - Well, do you have any idea of the amount of money they're worth? - You could pick these things right now. Whoever planted this stuff, he's close. He ain't gonna leave this campus, no. This old boy, - Hey! - he's runnin' this operation like it- (Bud laughs) - Hold this, man. - Ugh! - Oh, they found the drugs! Oh, party time! Everybody put your hands together for the cops. Party time! You better clap, dammit! I'm a bust your ass! Clap! (crowd applauds) How you doin'? My name is Gill Refa, and I'm with the Special Petty State Drug Task Force Coalition of America, and we've been working for like months, for months, on this particular case. And thanks to these two fine officers, we have got the drugs right here. I want to personally thank these guys. They did a wonderful job. This is Officer Pink Shirt. He's like a pimp. He used to be a pimp, but now, he's a cop. And this is Officer Dick. He's the big Dick. He look like he in charge of everything. Got the Columbo look, smell like, even smell like shit (laughs). So I'm gonna take this home, I'm gonna smoke it. No, I ain't gonna smoke it. I'm gonna put it home, put it in the room as Exhibit A. Y'all did a wonderful job. Y'all should go get you some donuts. It's donut time! Everybody, one more time for the cops, y'all! - Are you getting this? Get in there. - All this props, y'all. Y'all did a wonderful job. Excuse me. - Hey, hold tight. - Hold- (crowd applauds) - Just go now, Bud, but thank you. All right. Good. - The cops! (crowd continues applauding) - [Coach] What exactly were you hollerin' about up there in them bleachers, son? - Well- (phone rings) - What exactly were you screaming about quitting? (Coach farts) - I just had a little bit a smokin' problem, you know? So we- - Ended quitting? - Yeah, finally, yes. - Have you figured out how yet? - No, I just realized today. - Well, it takes a big man to realize that there's a somthin' (farts) causin' a problem in his life, you know? - You see what happened- - The question was rhetorical, son. I just wanna win. - Sorry, Coach. - Now, we're going to take 'em at nationals this year, and you're gonna help us get there. Go on, get the hell outta here. - Okay, Coach. (slurping) (water gurgling) - What's up, freshman? - Hey, listen, I've been wantin' to tell you somethin'. - Tell me what? (squeaking) (finger boinging) - I'm ready for your name right now. (Craig laughs) - You... You just... (continues laughing) And how do you figure you're gonna do that, hmm? - You like competition, right? (triumphant instrumental music) - Let me get this straight. You win, I get outta Lisa's life forever. I win, you quit the track team, and leave the university, and that's it. - That's it? - Remind me to give you some references to some junior colleges I know. (inhales sharply) (triumphant instrumental music continues) (Angel laughs) (whistle trills) (Craig sniffs) - [Coach] All right, let's go. On your marks. (triumphant instrumental music continues) (whistle trills) (footsteps clomping) (triumphant instrumental music continues) (Ed groans) - Ew! (Craig yells) - [Craig] Yeah! Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Oh, yeah! Yeah, boy! (triumphant music continues) (whistle trills) - What? You lied to me, Yolanda? - I didn't know how to tell you, Sádico. - Well, if he's not the father of that baby, then who is? Who? (Yolanda shakily sobs) - Please, please, I'm begging you. Please don't kill him. - Who? (Yolanda continues sobbing) Who? - Angel. - Angel? Angel who? - It's Angel. It's Angel. (dinging) - Who? (whistle trills) (dramatic orchestral music) - Okay, don't stop (gun clicks) until your clips are empty. (gun clicks) - Got you, Papi. - Alonza. - Keep up. - Okay now, on my count. One, two, three. (dramatic orchestral music continues) (feet shuffling) Hey, freeze! - Freeze! - Don't shoot. I got glaucoma. (gun clicks) - Glaucoma. - I got glaucoma. - [Dabias] Can you see that? - Yeah, (stammers) I can see that. - It was a student who tipped us off. That's how we found out who this perpetrator was runnin' a million dollar a year business right here in the campus. (Dabias coughs) - A million dollars, get it? - Yeah. - Custodian by day, drug kingpin all night. Yeah. - Detective, do you have any comments? - We caught the bad mother, baby. - [Brenda] Were there any others? - I mean, who'd have known it was the real dirt was the folks that was supposed to be cleanin' it up. We're rounding everybody up for interviews. He's not speaking with us. He's not giving us names, but we know there's others out there, that's for sure. Yeah. - We're gonna make that canary sing. Get it? - Yeah. This case ain't closed yet. (gunshots blasting) (heavy breathing) (dramatic orchestral music) (crowd gasps) (indistinct chattering) (dramatic orchestral music continues) (gunshots blasting in the distance) (gunshots firing) (objects clattering) - Culo! - Okay. - You don't fuck with Sádico's sister, maricón. - Yo, come on, man. Please, yo! (gun clicks) Please, I- (female screams) - Okay, say hello to my little friend! (gun clicks) - Freeze! (siren wails in the distance) - We got us some more bad mothers, baby. (siren continues wailing) - [Dabias] All right, boys, put your guns down slowly. Come on! Put your gun down! (indistinct police radio chatter) (Angel groans) (footsteps clomping) (police radio chirps) (footsteps continue clomping) (indistinct chattering) - I'm coming to you live from inside PSU University, where just moments ago police arrested several armed gang members involved in a violent campus shootout. The gang members are also being questioned in their possible role in running a million dollar a year drug operation through the school's custodial office. Details are still a bit sketchy. But so far, indicative of a changing educational environment, where drugs, gangs, and violence continue to work their way into our schools. I'm Brenda Foresight coming to you live from PSU University. Jake! Jake! Let's get the story. (footsteps clomping) (indistinct police radio chatter) (Brenda speaks indistinctly) (police radio chirps) (upbeat hip-hop music) - Hey, what up, baby? - [Ed] What's up, pimp? - Hey, yo, man, that was some crazy stuff that jumped off the other day. - Yeah, that was crazy, right? What happened to y'all, though? Y'all bounced. - Nah, man, it wasn't even like that. We had class. - (sucks teeth) Yeah, right. (upbeat hip-hop music continues) Yo, sorry about the dorm change, though. - Yo, don't even sweat it, man. Found out the coach made you do it. - Nah, man, I'm quittin'. Yo, Coach, you know, gave me a car for a clinic off campus for rehab. I think I'm a go. He says, I still have enough time to make the Collegiate Final. - A'ight! Yo, you know I'm a be there rootin' for you, man. - Word. Thanks, man. Yo, you can come if you want to. - No, I think I'm gonna just chill here for a minute. Besides, I've been thinking about re-registering for class, you know, before the deadline. - Seriously? - For real. - Yeah, man. That's hot. (Bud scoffs) (upbeat hip-hop music) Well, things worked out after all. Decided to clean up my act, and things started falling into place, classes, track, and you know, (chuckles) I got the girl of my dreams. The moral of the story is sometimes a simple life change can make a big difference in how things turn out for you. It certainly did in mine. Oh, wait a minute. One more thing. Angel, well, his decisions caught up with him too. - This is gonna be your home for the next seven years, my friend. (cell doors clanking) (intense dramatic music) (indistinct chattering) (alarm sounding) (door clangs) (cell door clatters) He was beggin' us to share your cell. (door slams shut) (Angel breathes heavily) (guard laughs) - It's been a long time, huh, Eddie? - No! (Angel yells indistinctly) (bite crunching) Please!
