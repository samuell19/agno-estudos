In a place a little way from our world, lived a young man called... Ovreneli Vreneligare. This is a story about his adventures. Every morning, Ovreneli Vreneligare brushed his teeth ate breakfast and read the newspaper. From Monday to Friday, Ovreneli Vreneligare went to the office. Commuting was not his strong point. A personality flaw always impeded smooth passage. On weekends Ovreneli Vreneligare had a lot of free time. He relaxed at home... relaxed at home... or relaxed at home. At times he picked at splinters and smoothed them out. Sometimes he went to the supermarket. His weekends were spent in unremarkable quiet. Ovreneli Vreneligare lived with Verandola Gongonzola He drew pictures of their dreams on the wall. Verandola Gongonzola was a wise soul. He was quiet, good-natured and adored people. It was a pleasant sunny Sunday "Something good might happen today"... thought Ovreneli Vreneligare. So after going to the supermarket he took a walk in the park. "But there's nothing to do in a park" thought Ovreneli Vreneligare. He opened a drinking yoghurt and began to drink it happily As he was on the verge of swallowing the first sip, he noticed a woman sitting next to him. She had beautiful, clear skin and looked very clever. Her name was "The Great Milocrorze." "Who is she?" thought Ovreneli Vreneligare. But he felt awkward about asking. So he blew and sucked air in and out of the empty pot. at that moment lost in thought Milocrorze looked up from her book. Awed by the divine Milocrorze, Ovreneli Vreneligare wept and sucked up the mucus flowing from his runny nose. He had become transfixed. Then something happened. Slowly turning towards him Milocrorze spoke... Do you come to the park often? The banality of the question put our hero at a loss. Thinking of clever replies he rehearsed them repeatedly in his mind. Finally, he settled for... His right hand tensed up and crushed his beloved yoghurt container. From that day, life changed for Ovreneli Vreneligare. He worked hard for Milocrorze day and night. For Milocrorze, he smiled like he had never smiled before. For Milocrorze, he bought a house beyond his means. Dreaming of their life together Ovreneli Vreneligare radiated new found contentment. Soon they were living together. Ovreneli Vreneligare couldn't help but enjoy life. The commute he once so hated was no longer a burden. He didn't even mind when his cat Verandola Gongonzola left him. He had Milocrorze and together they relaxed at home. Ovreneli Vreneligare loved Milocrorze so much that even watching her eat or seeing her elbow in the window made him think "Milocrorze you're gorgeous." Sometimes they sat by the sea and watched the sunset together. Sadly, happiness was not to last The couple's relationship changed. Milocrorze stopped coming to the park or to Ovreneli Vreneligare's house Mustering courage our hero invited Milocrorze to walk with him. "Has something happened? Is something bothering you?" He asked with difficulty. With similar difficulty The truth is, I don't like drinking yoghurt. "Then what do you like?" Ovreneli Vreneligare asked desperately. If anything, I am partial to Soda. But her manner was as indifferent as the expression on her face. From that day on Ovreneli Vreneligare started drinking Soda But the more he drank the thirstier he became. Upset by his love's behaviour our hero thought of a plan. It was not a good plan. Pretending to go to work, he spied on her. Milocrorze, the love of his life, was with another man! He was a big, sleazy man named Salamandala Quorenzolich. Don't worry too much about his name. His part in the story is very small From that day, Ovreneli Vreneligare stopped smiling. He covered the hole in his heart with the lid of a saucepan. And he waited for Milocrorze to come home. But Milocrorze would never return to Ovreneli Vreneligare's home again Confused about what had gone wrong Ovreneli Vreneligare continued to think of Milocrorze every day. His cat Verandola Gongonzola had vanished, too. Our hero developed the habit of sighing uncontrollably. He did very little with his time and with nothing to look forward to he led an extremely dull life The end. "Is that really the end?" You may be thinking. Yes, the adventures of Ovreneli Vreneligare... end right here. "5PM Evening Show" Assistant Arisa Urahama -- Host Yosuke Saito Hello, ladies and gentlemen. This is the 5PM Evening Show.

I can just imagine your troubled, wry smirk. So what s wrong, loser boy? My girlfriend and I have been together for 6 months. She seems happy when I call her but she has never once called me. Does she really like me? I'm so confused. So you're depressed. You're wondering what to do. Yes. You're an idiot. If that's your problem you're a bigger loser than I thought. Before you get depressed, go straight to the chick's apartment. Have you got that? Ring the chick's doorbell. As soon as she comes out, tweak her nipples. She'll swoon and kneel before you. Do you understand? But you have to do this with confidence. If you're hesitant she'll punch you in the face Your other option is to stay depressed and keep crying into your pillow. But that won't make the chick come to you and you'll have to keep paying high phone bills forever. So either way, isn't it smarter to do it that not, huh?! See ya, loser boy! Directory enquiries. Can I help you? Could you give me the number for youth counselor Besson Kumagai? Hold for one moment please. Here is the number. The number you requested is toll-free 0120-783 Youth Counseling Hotline. Besson Kumagai speaking. What d'ya want? What? You're crazy about a cute stewardess on the bullet train? - 2 beers, please. - One moment. Anything for you, sir? That's 2,000 yen. A charming, beautiful, stunning woman. Sexy too You ride the train once every 3 days just to see her. Same car, same seat... Hoping she'll notice you one day... I see. Now you're troubled because you're running out of money. You're an idiot If she's a stewardess on a bullet train, no matter how cute she is, she's definitely not from a wealthy family. One can assume she's been hard up since childhood. She's used to a humble lifestyle and has down-to-earth dreams about love and the future. And she already knows what you're up to. That's 300 yen. But she's furious about the way you waste your money She wears a friendly smile, inside she's saying... "Why is he grinning like an idiot?" "Moron." That's what she really thinks of you. Enough! Stop wasting your time and money riding the train. Got it? Then just watch the effect on the enemy. "I haven't seen him lately..." She'll start wondering about you. Then one sunny day, on a riverbed where you can see the bullet train make a cup of coffee on a small gas burner. The moment the bullet train crosses the bridge raise your cup to the sky as if you were making a toast. Sugar and Milk. Be careful. It's hot. Got it? The next time you ride the bullet train if the enemy doesn't throw herself into your arms you simply don't have what it takes. So give up. Hello? Youth Counseling Hotline. Besson Kumagai speaking. You want to become a guy who all the girls notice but you don't have the courage to do things to draw their attention. Is there a sure-fire way to succeed? Eh? You know, courage is what makes a man a man. For a cowardly wimp like yourself I suggest the following lesson. Go to the bank first thing in the morning. Politely wait your turn. Customer number 4... When your turn comes, the pretty clerk will say... Thank you for waiting. And she'll smile at you. Then put your elbow on the counter, cross your legs and say... You're welcome. I'm thinking about opening a time deposit account. Say it in a friendly manner. That'll give you confidence and perk up that dismal face of yours Then go to a high-class lounge. A dolled-up chick will say... First time here, right? Her smile will be half-friendly, half-scornful. Then you laugh in a cool yet approachable way. Soon after this a girl will ask... May I drink something too? She'll pout Then... Give an ambiguous reply, look the enemy in the eye and say I have some medicine that'll cure your haemorrhoids. Shocked, The enemy will throw water at you. The other hostesses will be taking notice of you, too. Finally, go to a supermarket, and say loudly... Give me some rubbers! Say it at least twice every other day. The chicks will think... "He's so butch!" They will look at you with longing. Give me some rubbers! After 2 weeks, your courage will be infallible and all the chicks will be enamoured by you. Give me some rubbers! Give me some rubbers! Give me... Rubbers... Hey! Hey! Don't die! Get up! Hey you! Get up! Where's Yuri?! Not yet! Don t die yet! Not yet! You know how long I've been looking for her?! Tell me where she is! Where's Yuri?! Tenzakuro. We sold her... Tenzakuro. Let me introduce myself. My name is Oryu, dealer of Tenzakuro's gambling parlor. It is my pleasure to be here with you. Allow me to warn you in advance. If you behave suspiciously and we suspect you of cheating no matter who you are you will not be shown mercy. I've seen many cheats shed their filthy blood here. I very much hope that today will be a pleasant day without bloodshed. What? It sounds like you're expecting us to cheat. No, I am not. I simply warn of the consequences, should you do so. You're getting above yourself, woman. And your whores are over-priced. By the way, Sister... How much do you cost? The gentleman would be wise to mind his manners. This hurts! Damn you! Ready? Is everyone ready? Let's begin. Going in. Your bets. Place your bets. - Even. - Odd. - Even The bets are closed. Open. 5 and 2, odd. All right! Ready? Is everyone ready? Going in. Your bets. Place your bets. - Even. - Odd. Not many evens! Anyone for even? Even. The bets are closed. Open. 5 and 2, odd. Can I check the dice? It seems that the gentleman doesn't trust me? Go ahead. Is the house allowed to cheat? You... are about to die. They're all going to die. Because of you. What of it? I've.. been risking my life to protect this house. Yours is not the only life at risk! Son of a bitch... You will not bring this house down! I walked past your flower stall by chance. When I first saw you I felt as thought I'd been struck by lightning. with me joy is always accompanied by misfortune. Um... Yes? These flowers... I'll take them all. Okay. The pitcher plants? No. I mean... These. Lilies? Yes. All of them. Will they be a gift? Yes, they will. Wow. So many. Her face was so gentle sweet and adorable Here you go. Never again would I find a woman who could match her. Thank you. How much? For you... 2 ryo. A little steep. In fact, expensive. But how could I haggle? Here. Just right. Thank you. They're... for you. What? My name is Tamon. They're from me to you. With her sweetest smile, she said... My name is Yuri. It was pure luck that her name meant "lily". I fell utterly in love. It must have been an illusion, but then love is an illusion. In any case, all I could think of was Yuri. I sent her love letters every day. That day, I was going to propose to her. Morning delivery, Miss. Good morning. Where are you going? He's gone... Shall I get him? It's okay. He'll be back. A capricious cat. He's a stray. Have I come too early? It's almost noon. For you. Thanks. Do you have any other animals? Sort of... Um... Sorry. Here. Bye. I still wanted to tell her how I felt so I went to see her the next day. Hello Something wrong? I lost my necklace. I might have thrown it away. Is it important? Yes. I'll be in trouble without it. I'll find it. - Forget it. - I'll be back. Forget it! Where's the necklace I gave you? You're hurting me. You're not wearing it. Yuri! Stop it! Who's he? He stinks You paranoid monster! What are you doing?! What's between you and the guy who reeks of garbage? Nothing. Yes there is! You bitch! Tell me the truth. I found someone to truly cherish. Yuri... Marry me! Released from the stench of terror so much part of my past, I encountered a new odor. An odor I had never encountered before. From then, Yuri and I spent a blissful time together. When I was with her, everything seemed to glow. I felt compassion for everything. Whenever I held you my spine felt numb with joy. It was sheer happiness. This was what they meant by happiness. I discovered that everything in life began with love. Yuri used to ask me... Will we always be together? I always used to answer... Yeah I'll even build us a tomb. A little early to be thinking of death! Once again profound joy had been accompanied by misfortune. I felt worthless. I couldn't protect the woman I love. A highball. Have you seen this girl? Looking for someone? Yeah. Her. You know her? No! I bet she has great tits. You... miss her pussy, huh? Leave it. You dissing me?! Just forget it. You think I'm ugly, eh?! No. I'll bet you do. Say you do dammit! Just shut it and get out of my face! You do think so. Anyone who thinks so is... a dead man. Her. Who's she? She's hot. Nobody had any useful information. Ever since I had lost an eye, I had become ill-tempered. Frustration and self-hatred didn't make it any better. Penniless, I ate off the streets. Sure enough, I got sick. Yuri... Where are you? I'd give my life to see you come back. But until I find you, I'm not going to die. I did anything to get information on Yuri's whereabouts. Good or bad, it didn't matter. It was kill or be killed. I became ferocious. And strong. Another year passed. I finally found out that Yuri was alive I heard the tattoo artist Gazen knew her whereabouts. Excuse me! Excuse me! What?! I have a question. Come in. Are you Gazen? What d'ya want? Has this girl ever been here? I don't know. Have you seen her? I never forget a customer's face She's not mine. Okay... Who's she?! I don't know! Don't lie! That's my old man's customer. Old man? My master, Gazen. He's in the back. Hey! You have a visitor! Go to the back. Oh... You're not Gazen. Excuse me. I said excuse me! Old man... Do you remember her? Really? When was she here? 10 years ago. That's not possible. Think hard. When? When did you see her last? It wasn't 10 years ago, right? Maybe 3 at most? Right, 3 years ago. Are you sure? 3 years? 3 years ago. Was she doing okay? She was fine. I see. Did you tattoo her? What kind of design? Butterflies? Spiders? Butterflies?! Spiders?! Spider. It was a spider. Do you really remember? Did you get her name? Did she tell you it was Yuri? Yuri? Yes, Yuri. Are you sure?! - Get serious! - Ouch! Come on! Answer me! Where is she?! Who? This girl! Senile fool! Forget it. Oi! Most of our customers are whores. There are thousands of whorehouses here. And even if your girl was our customer she'd be working under a different name. Finding one specific whore around here isn't easy. But I will find her. I continued looking for Yuri I finally found her captors Where'd you take Yuri?? Where's Yuri?! I can't lose them. They know where Yuri is I arrived in Taisho City. A lawless town. I built a grave on a hill. It was for Yuri and I. It was morbid but it strengthened my resolve to find Yuri. Yuri's alive. In that town... In Tenzakuro... Welcome to Tenzakuro My name is Yukine and I'm the guide. Here, we offer great pleasure to men. We're not like other bordellos. First of all, our women are of exceptional quality. We also offer experiences you can't find anywhere else in the world.

Is there a girl here called Yuri? Yuri? Let me think... No... We don't have a Yuri. I heard she was here. All the girls of Tenzakuro. See? A fine array, don't you think? A girl named Yuri... No, not here! Look... Forget about her and enjoy yourself. I want that one... Kumoi. I'm so sorry. Kumoi is very popular. If you want to sleep with her, you need 5 times more than that. That's too much! Don't be such a bully. You see... She's worth it. She gives men pleasure they've never experienced before. Your expression frightens me. Sir... Our business lies in the value of our women. We have no intention of selling them cheaply. Our women determined their own value. They will not sleep with men who can't afford them. These are the rules that govern Tenzakuro. We have many girls you can't even buy with money. I know your reputation. But I want to see Kumoi. Just let me see her. No, that's not how things work.

I've been searching for you. Finally I've found you. At last. It's me! - Come on. Let's go. - No! Who are you? It's me, Yuri! Stop! Come on. I built a grave for the two of us. Tamon? Tamon! They've got me! You didn't have to worry about me. No... I looked for you. You can't die! I missed you. Tamon... How I searched for you... Tamon, don't leave me. You can't die! I'm all right. The sun... The sun's rising. Let's escape together. Let's do that. Tamon! Tamon! Tamon! Do you remember the story of Ovreneli Vreneligare? 30 years on... After years of growth the hero is now 37 years old. "Ovreneli Vreneligare (37 at death)" The hole in his heart is still a hole in his heart. It remains covered with a lid from a saucepan. As an adult, Ovreneli Vreneligare enjoys hot springs. In the winter, he'd go on 3-day trips to remote hot springs. Exciting, adventurous trips. That day, he arrived at Nipple Spring in Autumn Field. "Nakyamura" Ovreneli Vreneligare entered Nakyamura Inn and said... Excuse me... I have a reservation... The hero's eyes widened in astonishment He dropped his bag and his legs began to tremble. His face contorted and his eyes filled with tears. This ugly situation is called "losing one's cool." The young proprietress of the Nakyamura Inn was the beautiful Milocrorze, whom Ovreneli Vreneligare loved heart and soul. She was as beautiful as she was 30 years ago. She recognized our hero the moment she saw him. Suddenly an unfamiliar man appeared. He was not Salamandala Quorenzolich. What happened to Salamandala Quorenzolich is a mystery. It was very important to Ovreneli Vreneligare but now he had other things on his mind. Why was Milocrorze here? This man was obviously very intimate with Milocrorze. Was he her husband? Was his name Nakyamura? (which was also the name of the inn) It's been a long time. How's the inn doing? Well... Not too good. There's nothing special about the scenery or our hot spring. We're just about getting by. But people seem to like the inn. Yes. It has a nice atmosphere. Really? You married him? Yes. This is our 12th year. Are you happy? Yes. I'm happy. Um...! I still love you even now. Come and live with me again. Let's get back together... Ovreneli Vreneligare cried out repeatedly in his heart. But if he really said that, she would think he was crazy. But he would never have a chance like this again. Mustering his courage, he fought the pain in his stomach. He straightened his back, and breathed deeply. Ovreneli Vreneligare had made up his mind. Um...! Why don't we have lunch together? I'll introduce you to my husband. You're our only guest today. Okay. Ovreneli Vreneligare couldn't refuse the unappealing invitation and completely lost his chance to say what he wanted. Listening to Nakyamura drone on Ovreneli Vreneligare tried hard not to barf during the meal. So you're... an old friend of hers? That's nice. She's happy and I'm happy. Living in the countryside, we rarely get to see our old friends. Really... What a great coincidence. Do you go often? To hot springs? This place isn't particularly famous. Not at all. What can I say? It has a homey atmosphere. Like you're returning to your own home in the countryside. Like you're returning to your childhood. The place has a nostalgic feel... There aren't many places like this. Most inns are just out to make money. I don't like that. I quit my job and we moved here from Tokyo. It hasn't been that long since we bought this place. The house is still the same. Your room is still there. Come back home! Please. What did you say?! The same to you! The 3-day trip ended in approximately 2 hours Are you okay? I'm... okay. Goodbye. Um... Take care. Sure. Ovreneli Vreneligare thought "The Great Milocrorze was, is, and always will be great." Milocrorze (55 at death) Ovreneli Vreneligare went to the sea and sunk his house. He sunk it in a place full of memories of Milocrorze. Suddenly he realised that the hole in his heart had closed. Ovreneli Vreneligare was delighted and felt very, very happy. After this, Ovreneli Vreneligare led a good life and died a good death.
