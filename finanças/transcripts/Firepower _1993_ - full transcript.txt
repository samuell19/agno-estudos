[electronic music] FEMALE REPORTER: NASA announced today that the first phase of construction of the orbiting space station will be completed next week and a joint American-Japanese manned mission to Mars is planned for early next year. A report today from the National Institute of Health has linked the sudden resurgence of AIDS cases thought to be nearly eradicated five years ago to a counterfeit AIDS vaccine, which is virtually indistinguishable from the real thing, but missing the very expensive enzyme discovered by a team of Swiss researchers in 1997. Hear what she said, Lenny? SLEDGE: You know how it is. So many women, so little time. Yeah, well it going to be back no glove, no love. That's the way it's got to be. FEMALE REPORTER: Authorities believe this counterfeit vaccine which has been flooding the health care system is being manufactured in the Los Angeles area by the growing underground crime rings that have centered in the city's zone of personal freedom, which is the subject of tonight's focus segment. MALE REPORTER: The views in this portion of the broadcast do not necessarily-- LENNY: Hey, man. I don't know why you have to settle yourself with a wife and kid anyway. You're still young enough to party. [chuckles] MALE REPORTER: When the city council, in an effort to reduce the burden on strained police budgets, created the zone of personal freedom in 1999 where police services would not be provided, it seemed like a good idea. So-called victimless crimes, prostitution, drug use, gang vendettas would no longer overtax the system. And for a while, it worked. Crime rates in the rest of the city were reduced dramatically. But in the seven years since its creation, it has become a lawless no man's land commonly referred to as the hell zone, ruled by underworld gangs most notoriously, The Hell Riders, who perpetrate their violent acts in the city at large and then escape into the dark shadows where our police now fear to follow. It is time the city council admitted its mistake and clean up this blot on our city of the future. And that's my perspective. [music playing] And who do you suppose they're going to get to clean that out? Man, I should just drop a bomb on their hell zone. BOONE (ON RADIO): Sledge, Braniff. It's Boone. There's been an armed pharmacy holdup in your sector. Fatalities. Suspects are bangers in a blue '98 Chevrolet. Sounds like your invitation, man. [police sirens] [electronic music] Damn it! They're headed for the zone. [music playing] [beeping] BOONE (ON RADIO): [inaudible]. One of the bangers has been identified as Mendez, a [inaudible] swordsman. Be careful. That word is not in my vocabulary, baby. Ass wipe. She digs you, man. Why don't you go for it? I don't dip my pen in the company ink, man. They're heading for the zone. [tires screeching] [beeping] [suspenseful music] [gunshot] Sheesh! [suspenseful music] [yelling] Come and get me, pigs! Well, you got love those smart bullets. [grunting] Cool it! You don't need another brutality mark on your record. Brutality? It's just a little male bonding. If I see your face, right then I'll kill you. [inaudible]. If I let you see my face, you just might fall in love. Let's get him out of here. [woman talking on radio] [electronic music] See you later. All right, man. Talk to you later. [woman talking on radio] [beeping] That's all I need. [inaudible], how you doing? Hey, Pierce. There's a report [inaudible]. All right. You hear gas is going up again, to $30 a liter? I tried to sell my car this weekend. Piece of junk just sits in the driveway and mandatory insurance, it's killing me. Did he already take it? Only one. And I couldn't give the damn thing away. I even offered to sleep with the guy. But I think he just wanted those damn tires. [women talking] We got Mendez. Let's run him through. Uncuff him. [grunts] POLICEMAN: What's the offense? Armed robbery, attempted murder, flight. Oh, he's carrying phosphorus loads. Good thing this boy can't shoot. This shit wouldn't have done any good. Oh, and he was carrying this. Must have stolen it from that pharmacy. What is it? [beeping] The hell if we know. Looks like he's in kind of bad shape. Yeah, he resisted. I'm going to remember you two oinkers. POLICEMAN: Sounds to me like he's resisting again. SLEDGE: Yeah, that's right. Oh, shit. Hey, when are you going to get a haircut? [scoffs] We ought to go back to the old dress codes. I mean, this department has gone to hell in a handbasket. LAPD. Rock and roll division. POLICEMAN: Get a life and get him the hell out of here. BOONE: Hey, Braniff? Yo. Know of any good carpool openings? That old blue line sucks. I'm riding my bike, honey. What about you, Sledge? [footsteps echoing] Lock it up. Have fun. [buzzing] You're a dead man, Sledge. [chuckles] [telephone ringing] Get a haircut. Well, hey Captain Croy. Yeah? Next week my kid's got to go in for a social evaluation. Can I get a couple days off? What am I, the wet nurse around here? Check with scheduling. BRANIFF: Thank you, Cap. [telephone ringing] [inaudible] just captured The Swordsman. They're bringing him in now. CAPTAIN CROY: What? Why are they bringing him here? Why in the hell didn't they take him up to high security? Well, they were afraid that the hell siders would expect them to do that. Oh, shit. Gear up. Get a cell open. Uncuff him. Let's run him through. CAPTAIN CROY: I don't want him here over a couple of hours. You get a security transport over here from central. I already called them. [metal jingling] [chuckling] Get him a cell. [dramatic music] [grunting] [grunting] [inaudible]! [yelling] Get him out of here. [grunting] Put another guard on that door. [metal jingling] Keep alert! He's got lots of friends! [buzzing] Hi, boss. [chuckling] [woman talking on radio] [beeping] [dramatic music] Get me central! Drop it! I need units here now! [dramatic music] [groaning] [metal jingling] Get me out, now! Let's go. What about me? [gunshot] [groaning] Boone, get the hell out of there! Boone, move! Boone, get the hell out of there. Shit! Boone, move! [yelling] Boone, move! Move! [gunshots echoing] Sledge! Wait for backup. You wait for back up. [yelling] [suspenseful music] Shit! [police siren] [dramatic music] [police sirens] (ON RADIO) Sledge, what the hell are you doing? Sledge, do you copy? Sledge! (ON RADIO) It looks like you still have a [inaudible] The Swordsman's goons have. He's plenty too thick for light weapons. I'm going to make another pass to see if I can find any kinks in the armor. (ON RADIO) Watch out, partner. You could run out of space real quick. (ON RADIO) It's a no go. This lane is about as tight as a virgin on her first date. [dramatic music] [police sirens] [tires screeching] (ON RADIO) Looks like we got air support. [police sirens] [dramatic music] [helicopter humming] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshots] [gun cocking] (ON RADIO) I'm going to try using the assault rockets that came with this baby. (ON RADIO) Sledge, you learn to shoot like that at the academy? SLEDGE (ON RADIO): This dang tracker is off. [dramatic music] [police siren] You all right? [groaning] [inaudible]. SLEDGE: To hell with it, man. I'm going in. Shit. [siren] [woman talking on radio] Hey baby, want to party? [chuckles] Not tonight, cowgirl. I haven't had my shots yet. Listen, a big guy got of this vehicle. See which way he went? What's it worth to you? [yelling] MAN: Don't come back here again, you dirtbag. [crashing] He's in there. Let's rock and roll.

I don't answer questions, I take bets. You'll bet or what? No. I dare you to kill a cop. [gunshot] Now that wasn't very neighborly, was it? Screw you. No, screw you. [gunshot] [gunshots] [laughing] Too bad we can't do that in the real world. [groaning] [groaning] We are looking for The Swordsman. [laughter] [groaning] We just don't get any respect anymore.

Let's give a loud, Death Ring welcome for the Viper! [pounds] [cheering] Think this is where Swordsman got his name? Supposed to be top dog around here, right? Want to make a bet? I'll take the little guy. Man, look at these bozos. That T-Bone jerk is flat on his feet. Little guy is going to kick his ass. [cheering] God, even you could do better than that. Oh, thanks.

We're on duty. Yeah, maybe some other time. [cheering] [laughing] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, here is your winner. Yes, look out for the sting of The Viper. [woman talking on radio] [police sirens] BRANIFF: Did you find out what this stuff is? CAPTAIN CROY: Lab says it might be AIDS vaccine. No shit. Is it real? If it is, it's worth a million dollars. But lab doesn't think so. They're still running spectroanalysis. Well, if the hell siders are running this stuff, The Swordsman can lead us right to them. So what do you want me to do about it? Send Him a nice letter? Let us go undercover. Absolutely not. I can't provide protection in there. But Captain, if we're going to catch him, we have to go into the zone. We're volunteering. You've got a family, Braniff. I mean, nobody's going to miss old Sledge here. What's your wife going to say about that? She'll just have to understand. Well, has to be done, right? You boys go out and get yourself killed, nobody's going to complain but the union. I want you to keep in close contact, do you understand me? I mean, I want reports. Get out of here. Yes sir. Yes sir. Don't. Funny. REPORTER (ON TV): And now, our award-winning channel 256 news on the pulse of the living city, with Sabrina Leblanc. SABRINA LEBLANC (ON TV): In Cleveland today, 14 police officers were killed and 17 wounded in an attempted sweep of that city's personal freedom zone after the mayor's announcement that the experiment which began in Los Angeles and was tested in Detroit, Phoenix, and Philadelphia had failed. REPORTER (ON TV): Coming this summer from Kamikazi Entertainment Group, Jake "The Tiger" Wilkinson, former IKBA middleweight champion in a death for a death. Critic Rog Reader raves, "I didn't know an action film like this was possible." Hi. Hi. Hi, sweetheart. I didn't know you were home. How you doing? Good. What are you doing? I got a new-- new assignment. It starts tonight. [melodramatic music] I thought were going to ask for a day shift. Look, they put me and Sledge on this. It's a big job. I might even get a promotion out of it. Oh, bull shit. That's what you wanted, isn't it? For me to get off the street, behind a desk? [inaudible],, what I wanted was for-- forget it. - What? Come here, what? You spend more time at the station than you do with us. It's my job. That's what I do. I was a cop when we got married. What the-- what do you want me to say? What?

[yelling] ANNOUNCER: But wait, the computer chooses the same weapon for The Swordsman. Odds change, 20 to 1 for The Swordsman. [metal clanging] [dramatic music] [groaning] ANNOUNCER: Oh, The Swordsman really got a nice piece of meat out of the Professor with that swing. OK, OK you Death Ring junkies, what do you say? What do you say? Do we spare Tonami? [yelling] [cheering] ANNOUNCER: Well, the Professor won't be teaching any more sword fighting classes now, will he? Here is your winner, The Swordsman. That's his 13th kill. No one's even come close. Here. Challengers wear blue. BRANIFF: Wait a minute. What about the rules? Rules? [laughs] There are only three rules you need to know. No moves before the buzzer sounds, stay on your feet, and the loser gets half pay. The computer will handle the rest. If you make the grade and you get five challenge around victories, then you can move into the championship category. And that's where the real money is, lethal combat. And the losers don't get paid. These will be your lockers. Good show. Got some fresh meat here who thinks they got the stuff. [suspenseful music] [laughing] You go ahead and make friends. We're pretty loose around here, but I wouldn't advise you to get too attached to anyone. You might be fighting him soon. Also, drinks are free in the bar after your matches. And have fun gentlemen. After all, it's only a game. Your match is up next following. What do you want to be called? The Hammer. What about you? Just call him The Pussy Cat. Yeah, that will go over real big. How about The Alley Cat? Hey, whatever. SLEDGE: So you think there's anyone around here that could tell us what's going down? You got to start someplace. Hey, how you doing, man?

Alley Cat wins his first fight in the Death Ring. Wager forms are now available for the next matches. Hey, nothing like a weapon you're familiar with, huh? I'm just trying to feed my family. Ain't much of a living flipping soy burgers. Besides, I didn't score so high on my social evaluation. Neither did I. Death Ring bets, gentlemen? Don't even think about it. She belongs to Drexal. Theodore Drexal? Man upstairs. He owns this dump. Yeah, and half the Hell Zone. That's the one. She's a squeeze. Well, one of them anyway. [electronic music] You want to bet? No, no, no. We're in the ring. Am I supposed to be impressed? Well, they said if we were fighting we'd get free drinks. We'd like another round, please. I'm not a waitress. I'm sorry. Look. You neanderthals would not get paid if it wasn't for what I do. So why don't you just go back to little macho bull shit session and let me do my job? She's loving you, man. Definitely. I've got to go, man. - All right, man. - See you in the ring. All right. So. Think she knows something? There's only one way to find out. Yeah well, I want to go check out the sultan's palace and see if I can uncover some information. Uncover some information? Yeah, you like that? Better doubled up on your shots. Hey, you're dangerous, dude. [electronic music] What? You want me to get you a cigarette now? Look, Lisa. I wasn't trying to give you a hard time. Why don't I just save you the smooth talk? I fell for a fighter once. He got killed in the ring. I don't need the grief. Yeah, well maybe I'm pretty good. Hey. I hear you're taken. People should just mind their own business, OK? I don't belong to anyone. I'm not a piece of property. There are customers waiting to bet. I watched your bout. Interesting. You use a stick like you've used one before. I practice a little. Yeah? Well, keep your stick in the ring. Don't practice on my girls. I need them to concentrate on their jobs so my business doesn't suffer. Because if my business suffers then my fighters, like you for instance, will suffer. We understand one another? Yeah, I understand. Keep my stick in the ring. That's clever. Real clever. ANNOUNCER: Why not try our new virtual reality vision? Feel what it's like to be a Death Ring fighter. The latest in virtual reality technology ripped off from Mitsutoshi entertainment.

[video game sounds] BRANIFF: Look, there we are. That's twice now. Oh, that was a good one. Look at you. You stay out all night, you come home looking like this. What's this assignment? [video game sounds] Don't worry about it, honey. I'll be fine. I can't take this, Darren. Not anymore. But Billy. What kind of example is for him, seeing his father all beaten up and smelling like death? Hey. I'm scared. I don't know you anymore. Look, what do you want me to do? It's my job. Quit! [video game sounds] I can't. Come on, Billy. Got homework. Come on. What are you-- MAN: I'll kick your ass in the next round. Hey. You find out anything? A few new ways to do it. [chuckles] I mean anything useful? No, nothing. [buzzer] Well, maybe something will pop up. Oh, I'm sure it will. ANNOUNCER: Meat hooks through the eye sockets! Oh, that's a new one. Why don't you Death Ring junkies give it up for Bad Comma. Yes, our Death Ring fighters are always finding innovative ways to take the other guy out. [cheering] How you doing? Jesus. Drexal? I don't want to talk about it, OK? [soft music playing] I come out here to just get away from it. Be alone, you know? Why don't you get out? Out? Where? To what? Well, you won't know unless you try. Well, maybe some of us were just meant to be here. Drexal, men like him it's what I know. Besides, I never found even better out there. Maybe you've been looking in the wrong places. I don't have to look, they find me. Go ahead, tell me you're different. Tell me you're not like all the rest. I'm not going to tell you I'm any different. All I know is I've got a son at home that I love very much and a wife that hates what I do. You expected her to like you fighting in the ring? It's a sideline. [laughs] The Alley Cat out on the prowl. Looking for a tabby in heat? Try another alley, Alley Cat. My name is Darren. Look, I don't want anything from you, Lisa. It's just sometimes I-- I get a little nosy. You know the Hell Zone boundary is four blocks that way. Why don't you try it? [laughs] It's that easy, huh? Yeah. It's that easy. See you around. What did you find out, man? Not much. I didn't want to spook her. I was talking to one of the guys. He says Drexal is like a Dutch uncle to The Swordsman. And? Which means he's got to be connected to the Hell Siders. MAN: Alley Cat. Yo. Listen. Because I like you, and the fans like you, want to give you a little friendly advice. Keep your nose clean. Don't be too curious. It's not healthy around here. Man, I just went out for a smoke. Yeah. That's not healthy either. Go on, you got a match coming up. Go get ready. Sure. ANNOUNCER: Betting for match 143 is now closed. Now let's give it up for The Alley Cat and The Stomper. [cheering] [cheering] [groaning] [cheering] [groaning] [computer sounds] ANNOUNCER: The computer gives a staff to the Alley Cat and a set of sickles to The Stomper. [suspenseful music] ANNOUNCER: The Stomper gets his butt stomped. That's victory two for The Alley Cat. [bright music] [laughing] You're a mean machine, Darren. Thanks, buddy. You go get 'em, huh? Not bad. You guys are coming along. Thanks, man. I think we're finally getting the hang of it. [rock and roll music] ANNOUNCER: Here we go. Match 144, The Hammer versus The Maniac. [rock and roll music] [cheering] [cheering] [computer sounds] ANNOUNCER: Two scythes for the champion. And a staff for The Hammer. [cheering] [rock and roll music] [cheering] [grunting] [cheering] [groaning] [cheering] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, here is your victor. The Hammer. Spot me? BRANIFF: Hold it, hold it. Jesus. Thanks. No problem. You know Darren? Something I've been meaning to talk to you about. Yeah? There's something about you two. You don't seem like the regular sort of guys who do this. Why is that? For starters, you don't seem to give a shit about the money. It's like you here for something else. Listen. When I was coming in, I saw Drexal talking to The Swordsman and some of those gangbangers. What was he saying? He was saying something about-- MAN: Viper. - Yo. The challenger for the main event bailed out. We're bumping you to a championship match. - But I haven't qualified yet. - Hey. You want it or not? We can give the money to someone else. Shit, yes I want it. Hey. You sure you're ready for this? What are you talking about? This is my chance. ANNOUNCER: OK boys and girls. We've just had a replacement for tonight's championship match. It will be The Viper versus The Rocker. So keep your heads down, because the blood and the guts are going be flying all over the place. [cheering] Got a bad feeling about this. [cheering] [cheering] [groans] Come on, Viper. Kick his ass man. [cheering] [groans] ANNOUNCER: Computer selects a sword for the Viper. [beeping] ANNOUNCER: And it looks like a hatchet for The Rocker. Oh, a tough break for The Viper. There goes a promising career. [electronic music] I knew something was wrong. Well, don't beat yourself up over it, man. You warned him not to do it. I could have stopped him. The man had a mind of his own. Why the long faces? Friend of ours ended his career last night. His weapon wasn't released. I know, I saw it. That's what happened to my boyfriend. Shit happens. Since when is anything fair? It didn't just happen. It was murder. Murder in the Death Ring? There's a major distinction. It's run by a computer. You just don't get it, do you? It was Drexal. And he probably killed your boyfriend too. Look, Lisa. Our friend was going to tell us something about a vaccine. Now you've done it, man. She knows you're a cop. She knows something. BRANIFF: Hey. What's the deal? That was a god damn setup. Didn't you hear? Anything can happen in the Death Ring. What, even rigged matches? Viper wanted to fight lethal. He got what he wanted. Ah. That's what Hell Zone is all about. Everybody gets what they want. And you? What do you want? I try not to want anything. I live here. [telephone ringing] Stay out of there. We're not fighting any lethal matches. I don't care. It's too dangerous. Look, we have a contact. And if you ask me, I think she'll blow our cover. Nuh-uh. How do you know that? Instinct. Look, we're this close, Captain. Why the hell is this so important to you? It's personal now, sir. Ah. Which is exactly why I shouldn't let this thing go on, which is exactly why I'm stopping it right here. Captain, did you get anything on that scum shooter we brought in? Mendez? Nothing. I'm having him transferred to high security. Let us do this, Captain. We're going to break it. Jesus Christ. OK. OK. Now get out of here. And get some sleep. You both look like a piece of fried shit. You have a good vacation. Dick head. [suspenseful music] [dramatic music] Come on, get these off me. [gunshot] Let's see what the hell we have here. Jackpot. 88212 East 82nd. Yeah. You're the cop who came here looking for The Swordsman the other night, aren't you? Don't deny it, I'm going to help. Why? Drexal. I thought about what you said about him fixing the match to kill my boyfriend. I just didn't really believe it before. I'm ready, Braniff. I want out. You want to know about the vaccine? He makes it in an abandoned factory at the edge of the Hell Zone. I don't know exactly where, but it's heavily guarded by the Hell Siders. Go on. That's all I know. I'll keep my ears open. Just get him. Well, if I do, you might be looking for another job. Oh, you're funny. [inaudible] Be careful. So are you ready for another day at the office? I just talked to Lisa. She said Drexal's factory is at the edge of the zone. How do you know you can trust her? I just do. Yeah how's Billy, mom? Is he behaving? [laughs] Oh no. Yeah, he's just like his daddy. He's always getting into trouble. Flowers for Mrs. Braniff. [laughs] One minute, hold on, mom. Yep. Hold on, hold on. Darren, is that you? [suspenseful music] Sorry, mom. I thought I heard Darren come in. [suspenseful music] Have a message to give to your husband. [dramatic music] [upbeat music] [cheering] [yelling] [grunting] [beeping] [computer sounds] [computer sounds] [cheering] [groaning] [yelling] [cheering] DREXAL: Well, look who's out of jail. Why'd you leave me in there? DREXAL: I thought it might serve as a lesson. I hope you didn't tell them anything you shouldn't have. Don't worry about me. I screwed over one of the oinks who put me in there. I'm glad you kept yourself occupied. I have a shipment going out tomorrow and I need you. Hey, that guy's a cop. He's one of them that grabbed me. I told him the next time I saw his face I was going to kill him. I think we have someone more suited to that purpose.

I think you better talk to the captain before you go any further. [women talking] CAPTAIN CROY: What can I do, Braniff? I'm going into the zone to get Drexal. I can't let you do that. Definitely not. They've killed my wife, my partner, I'm going in. And not you or anybody else is going to stop me. You want my badge, sir, that's the way it will be. I don't want your badge, son. I want you alive. Let me take care of that. [engine revving] Keep awake. Drexal said the cops might come. I only see one cop. One stupid cop. Let him have what he came for. [dramatic music] [suspenseful music] [footsteps echoing] DREXAL: Officer Braniff. I apologize for this recorded message and for not being there personally to greet you. But I have other business. A friend of yours is here with me. Remember her as she was, Braniff. [inaudible] I'm sorry the information will do you no good, Braniff. Hey, Officer Braniff. MAN: Goodbye. [dramatic music] New issue, asshole. Hey, you're looking good, bud. What's up? Hey, dig it. You know it.

[timer ticking] [gun cocks] [groaning] DREXAL: How foolish of you to come alone, Braniff. Your problem is with me, Drexal. Not the girl. Let her go. Drop the gun. Drop the gun! [chuckles] I know you. I know men like you. You take things too personally. You wanted to be a Death Ring fighter? Let's see how well you do. [dramatic music] DREXAL: Lovely Lisa will be the stakes. [suspenseful music] [groaning] [dramatic music] [groaning] [yelling] [groaning] [yelling] Darren! [screams] [yelling] [screaming] DREXAL: Too bad. But you lose anyway. [yells] [groans] BRANIFF: No. You lose. [groaning] [dramatic music] [music softens] Let's both get out of Hell Zone. [music playing] (SINGING) When you shake the dust, baby trouble will arise. Legends of riders [inaudible] in the night. They drew the lines, now we rule the streets. Our lips become moistened in the [inaudible] sweet. In no man's land, in no man's land. Caressing much deeper than the eyes are really showing. Reflections from the sun on the ground is growing. No more of what they had, satisfied their greed. They were born out of fire like a fire [inaudible].. If you get the desire to crave what the body needs. Yeah. We control the zones that call hell at home. We're the sinners casting stones. Who cares what's right or wrong? Still shots in photographs. Fingerprints and the cold hard cash. Lazy cops from magazine. Wild voices naming you and me. We like the vultures, the hookers and the freaks. Hell is the pathway the damned are bound to see. We're all tired of glory, puppets on a string. But when we turn our back on them, [inaudible].. If you get the desire to crave what the body needs. Yeah. We control the zones that are called hell at home. We're the sinners casting stones. Who cares what's right or wrong?
