Proclaiming by word and deed the Gospel of Jesus Christ. My sister, do you believe that you are truly called by God and his church to this priesthood? I believe I am so called. Will you endeavor so to minister the word of God, that the reconciling love of Christ may be known and received? I will. May the Lord who has given you the will to do these things, give you the grace and power to perform them. Amen. Father, through Jesus Christ, your son, give your Holy Spirit to Grace. And make her a priest in your church. [kiss] [music] Now, you may give the blessing. [camera flashing] Blessing of God Almighty. Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit, be among you and remain with you always. -[church bells ringing] -[tranquil music] Reverend McKenzie, what is the first thing you're planning... on doing as a priest? [people murmuring] I decided to make a silent retreat. A what? Well, the parish has given me a very special gift of... six days of so... I decided to spend time at the silent retreat. -Oh, I'm sorry Vera. -That's alright. Pretty isn't she? You interested, Bishop? Oh, and so you won't talk at all? Well I won't speak out loud, I... will pray. Thank you. Look at Grace and tell me if you think women at the altar are dangerous. A lot of people will feel reassured by seeing her up there. And that's why we decided not to keep the press at a distance anymore. In fact, we want all the coverage we can get. [sigh] Well, what do you think? How did I do? It was great, Mom. What about you, Rosalba? Did you like it? Very nice. You know I think the catholics are going to ordain women sooner than we think. Tell you what. Why don't you get in the car while I change, ok? I'll only be a minute. [pop music] I've found this great place, el Disco Latino. The guys there are so funny. They put stuff in their pockets, so you know they mean business. See what I mean? [laughter] [music player clicks off] Tonight, after your mom goes to sleep, we start to pray. We pray real hard, that God makes a miracle. What miracle? After I fall asleep, you take my body and go to the disco and dance. You want to do that? Yeah. You'll have my breasts, my legs, my feet... but your face will be yours. Costs three dollars to get in, ok? Ok. [knocking on door] Oh, Rosalba the shopping list is in the kitchen. If you and Rosalba want to talk about sex it's fine with me. I just want you to keep in mind there are other ways... of being a woman, besides having sex. [strained grunting] I'm not saying it's easy. It's been real hard for me since your dad died. Come on, mother! What do you mean come on? I mean you can have any man you want, you just don't care. I heard Bishop Holmes raving to the press. Poor Mrs. McKenzie. Lost her husband in a car accident. Devoted herself to God and her crippled daughter, isn't she divine? He must be fanatsizing about you. Oh, Vera, I ask you not to talk to me that way. [water dripping] Maybe I shouldn't have come. Oh, Vera. I'm jealous of you mother and I can't help it. It's not my fault, Honey. What happened is nobody's fault. Oh! I got you a present. Oh, Vera. It's gorgeous. Where did you get it? Try it on. -[kiss] -[light music] Oh, Mom, you look beautiful. I don't mind all those men staring at you, you're beautiful. You deserve it. I'll paint you at the sun ok? Vera, sometimes I think my calling comes from you. [dramatic music] "This is a desert place and the time is now passed. Send the multitude away, that they may go into the villages and buy themselves fiddles. But Jesus said onto them, 'Give ye them to eat.' And took the five loaves and the two fishes and looking up to heaven he blessed and break and gave the loaves to his disciples and his disciples to the multitude." [alarm ringing] [paper ripping and rustling] [soft music] [suspenseful music] Vera! Rosalba! [dramatic music] I thought I had a couple of leads. Unfortunately they didn't get me very far. So, I have to keep trying. It's been six weeks. Let me show you something. These are the kids we managed to find. Some of them took five years of looking. You gotta understand that most of them don't just up and go without some sort of plan. Most of them are going somewhere. So we gotta sit tight. [book closing] [chairs moving] [door opening] If you don't mind my asking, what's it like being a woman priest? My wife is killing me with questions. [light music] [dramatic music] How'd you get in here? I found your door unlocked. Vera, I know where she is. I can take you to her. Who are you? Lo siento. Philipe Robles. Call me Phil. [Phil] You don't tell the police or your private eye or even your bishop. You don't tell a soul, otherwise no deal. -Is she alright? -Fine. A very bright girl. Where is this place? Not far. Three hour drive. We'll drive together. You got a red light. Doesn't it have a name? Our people are very poor. No English, no papers, why should they call it something? To bring the immigration there? They don't even have a church. They worship in an old cantina. We're raising money to build them a new church. -We? -We. Go. [car accelerating] I offered a reward. You could use the reward money for that. We need lots more. How much? You can write me a post-dated cheque. Give it to me only when you see Vera. [paper ripping] Is she alright? Very good Mexican food here. Tacos al carbon. You want a taco al carbon? [laughter] We start tomorrow at six. I'll come to your house. I know where it is. [speaking in Spanish] You can't take a leave of absence now. Damn it, Grace. Think of the flack we'll be getting. So many people in this city want to see you up there... at that altar. You're gonna let them all down. Grace. Kids run away at this age, even crippled kids. Run away? Listen to this. For three years you have pretended that I am just like any other girl, a sickening lie. No matter how well intended. You chose not to see the cripple in me. And the woman in me. Sadly they are the same person. Please give me a chance to find myself. Want one? -[glass clinking] -[liquid pouring] I'll talk to Bishop Lucy, see how he feels about it. It's really up to him. [somber music] Grace. You act as if Vera were your faith. If she's gone, your faith is gone. [music] [snake rattling] [snake hissing] Buenos dios, Perfecto. Hello Mr. Robles. [speaking in Spanish] Then why aren't you up there? Padre Angel has prayed all night that the cross may bleed as... a sign of your redemption. Don't you wanna be redeemed, Perfecto? I see. You have to eat. They're all up there praying to see a miracle, but you have to eat. You stupid, starved snake eater. Get up and climb up that hill. And pray all the way. -[pained grunting] -[chuckling] [suspenseful music] [car grumbling] [ethereal music] [keys jingling] Cheque. [paper rustling] Don't tell nobody, remember? [choir singing] ♪Lamb of God who redeems us ♪ And the sins of the world ♪ [Grace] Vera, I'm so glad to see you, Honey. [Vera] I know you didn't want me to come. [Grace] What you said was right, in your letter. What you said was right, Vera. Vera! Vera speak to me, Honey. Rosalba why isn't she speaking to me? Father Angel ordered her to be silent. [dramatic music] -[people chanting] -[drum beating] ♪Lamb of God who redeems us ♪ And the sins of the world ♪ ♪ Oh, lamb of God ♪ [dramatic music] May we all be forgiven, healed and delivered. [people talking] [Father Angel] Brothers and sisters. Hermanos y hermanas. As I walked under the cross today, the Lord asked me a question. Man, named after my angels, who are you? And before I could lie, not to him to myself, I knew I was everything that fought and hurt Jesus. And so are you! -[overlapping chatter] -My brothers and my sisters. For 2000 years, day after day, we've been the hammer that nail him to the cross. We've been the thorns that break him and... the vinegar that he drank. We've been the spit on his face, and the dirt of the Romans fouling his tomb. [people shouting] And yet, he shows his blood to us. Today... he will do it again. He has faith in us. As we have faith in him. But his miracles are not free, brothers and sisters. He ask a miracle, for a miracle. [people shouting] The miracle of our faith. Let us give him his miracle today. [people shouting] Yes, sir! [tranquil music] [shuffling] Vera, what are you doing here? Did you bring her here? How did you know about this place? A cousin of mine lost all her hair. She came here in spring and grew it back. How long is she supposed to be silent? Until she's healed. [tranquil music] [glass clinking] [music building] [people shouting] Our faith, made it happen. Yes! Brothers and sisters... I read in this blood Christ's word clear as day. Save every penny to buy a new church, says Christ. Save every penny to build a shrine for my cross. Stop buying Green Cards from Don Tarjetas. And do not be afraid of his coyotes. For faith is the true everlasting Green Card. And there is no border that can check your faith. Faith is the miracle. Faith will heal us. [people shouting] [indistinct chatter] Thank you. Want some of this? [background chatter] [chickens clucking] [door creaks] Father Angel? I'm Vera's mother. I have come here to take her back with me. Back where? -Los Angeles. -Why? [scoffs] You wouldn't understand why. I'm sorry, I didn't mean that the way it sounded. I just meant... you know because we're from different worlds. Anyway, she's here because... I hurt her. And... I want to talk to her, but she won't speak to me, because evidently... look. I didn't pay that fancy little crook a whole lot of money just to watch your cross bleed. Ok, now I need to speak to her. Would you let het speak to me, please. If she speak to you know, it would only shake her faith. Why don't you wait till she's healed? If she could be healed? I waited till kingdom come. She can't be. It's impossible, she's been to the best doctors in this country. I've tried everything. Except a nice little Easter pageant like yours. The blood says they were wrong. [Angel] Besides, Vera was unhappy where she was. She was not with her people. You're her people? Of course. We share the faith. And we will share the healing. Well could you heal her in LA? Or doesn't your cross work long distance? [crash] [Man] Watch what you're doing, idiot! [speaking Spanish] I will pray that Christ give you patience. Would you like to pray with me? [knocking] I'll pray with you. Thank you, Perfecto. [sigh] [speaking Spanish] Keep this thing even! -Keep this thing even! -[soft music] [distant talking] It's coyotes. [speaking Spanish] -[banging on door] -[strained grunting] [yelling] [crashing] [yelling in Spanish] [grunt] -[voices yelling] -[thud] [Man] Not in the balls! He don't need them, he's a priest. [grunts] -What does he got on him? -Nothing. [splash] [speaking Spanish] I waited two weeks. Where is the money? Listen, Cabron, a year ago when you came here from nowhere carrying your cross. I gave you a parish. And I let you have half of every dollar you made. Now your dues are late. And you're stirring these worms against me. I'm gonna give you one last chance. Where is the money? In the bank. I opened an account for the new church. In the bank? Those sweaty, crumbly dollaritos from heartbroken, crippled mothers? Them? Yes. Swear by your cross. Bring him closer. [smacks] Search the altar. [speaking Spanish] Get me there! Hey! [suspenseful music] [speaking Spanish] Help! Take his cross away. [grunting] Out! Out! [yells] Help! [engine starting] Be reasonable. What do you know about him? [Grace] He might not even be a priest. For the love of God, Vera. What did he do to you? Please take him away, señora, otherwise they'll kill him. Oh, Jesus Christ. [sigh] Help me. Help me. Get him in the car. [speaking in Spanish] [car grinding] [sputtering] I know of another cross. What? I know of another cross like that one. A healing cross. Where is it. Juarez, Mexico. I must bring it to them, otherwise they will lose their faith. [sputtering] [Grace] The man in the wheelchair, Don Tarjetas, who is he exactly? Judas selling Green Cards. The border patrol shot his legs full of bullets. It was God's warning. But he won't listen. He never wanted to build a church, that's why I took his money. Is Angel your real name? Yes. My name is Grace. [laughing] I don't see anything so funny about it. [sigh] Look... I'll make a deal with you. I'll drive you there and back and then you'll give me Vera. -After she's healed. -Oh, for goodness sake. [sigh] -Can you drive? -I can drive. [crickets chirping] [car rumbling] [music] [keys clinking] [door creaking open] [door closing] -What are you doing? -Shhh. [check out ringing] [shifting] [thud] [machine whirring] I like the desert. So dry. So... pure. I'm not surprised so many saints receive their calling in the desert. -I received mine at sea. -Really? How did it happen? We used to fish with dynamite, me and a friend. He blew himself up and I nearly drowned. When I made it to the shore I found God there waiting for me. At first I thought he was a cop. He wore a suit and black shoes. He said... save the cripples. The way I saved you. I don't really know when I was called. About three years ago after I became a deacon, Vera and her father were in an automobile accident. That's why she can't walk now. And about an hour before he died, Bob told me that he thought my calling was true. It's funny. I think people know things like that, at times like that. He wasn't even religious. I'm a priest. I was ordained just... just before Vera left. You think women are not, uh, worthy of being priests. [slams] I'm sorry, this is the US not Mexico. It's not that. If you're a priest why did you doubt the blood when you saw it? Because mister only holy one, blood does not come warm and live out of inanimate objects. Do you think it wasn't blood? I don't know what it was. Do you think it wasn't Christ's living blood? I really don't know. Then why do you come with me if you don't believe it? Huh? We had a deal, remember? The Latins make the miracles, we gringos make deals. [crashing] A priest! Jesus falls on his knees before you every day and begs you to make a miracle for him. The easiest, tiniest miracle. Open your eyes, he begs. Open them and see my signs. Your daughter.... your daughter walks faster than you. Your daughter runs, you crawl. [smashing] [Grace] Wait! Where are you going? To get another cross. Why? So you can milk every penny out of those poor bastards back there? Show them hopes you know you can't fulfill? Go on. I know your kind of man of God. You know nothing about God. [sigh] [shuffling] That's the way to look for the cross. Walking in pain through the desert. Not driving in cars. [scoffs] Why do you laugh? My things are still in the dryer. [music] So how are you going to cross over tomorrow? Through the sewers. That's the way I crossed over the first time. I was six. Tomorrow... to cross the border, drive to the main plaza and meet me at the cathedral. If you don't find me there, take a cab and go to Mariposa. Mariposa is a street without numbers. Ask for Ciego, the blind man. I'll give you one to cross. [beads clicking] If he doesn't trust you... make him feel this. He remembers things he made. Whatever happens, don't look police. Just take the cross and go back to here, wait for me there. Buenos noches. [speaking in Spanish] [Angel] Dios mio. [ethereal music] [heavy breathing] -[panicked breathing] -[screams] [knocking] Just a minute! [beads clicking] Did you sleep well? Wonderful. I'm ready. [tranquil music] [background chatter] [engine sputtering] [Priest] Amen. [suspenseful music] [grunts] [Angel] If you don't find me there, go to Mariposa. Mariposa is a street without numbers. Ask for Ciego, the blind man. [engine rumbling] [indistinct chatter] [door creaking] [knocking] -¿Qué quieres? -Uh... Ciego. Así. I'm a friend of father Angel's. [laughing] [speaking in Spanish] [speaking in Spanish] [speaking in Spanish] Ciego! [speaking in Spanish] [arguing in Spanish] He can't see, but he can feel. [speaking in Spanish] Ciego? [ominous music] Ciego? [gasps] [beads clicking] Angelito, where is he? In California. Oh. California. Beautiful girls in California. [strained sigh] He is still handsome, Angelito. He could have all the girls. He is loco. [Ciego] Loco. Anything to declare? Ok. [engine sputtering] Ok. [tranquil music] [speaking in Spanish] [tranquil music] [trunk closes] [door creaking] [grunt] [tranquil music] Welcome home. Gimme the cross! Gimme the cross! [grunts] [speaking in Spanish] [door slamming] [chain rattling] You think that's gonna keep me out? Where's Angel? I thought your boys got him? They did but they lost him again. Oh. Thank God. Thank God. You like him don't you? Go ahead. Listen, we don't want him back there again. Well, those people do. He's their priest. We have another priest. Me. We have Vera. Don't let him come back there again. Otherwise, Vera goes. And if you want to make a deal, you call me. What if I don't wanna make a deal? [paper ripping] You will. Or I'll sit on you like a fly on trash. You will. [door slams] [door locking] [tranquil music] [knocking] [knocking] Grace? So what's next? Voodoo? You left here a sane person with a degree in theology and you came back an image worshipping half-wit. You want me to make a few phone- calls and find out this guy is a self-styled, self-appointed self-ordained crank. You're not going back there. Yes, I am. With this? I could go even without it. I could win. I'll deliver them. Grace. I've known you five years. I helped you through seminary. And I supported your ordination. I was your husbands friend and your friend and I'm your Bishop. I forbid you to go. What is wrong with you, Harry? Don't you believe in God at all? [knocking] [louder knocking] You're back! I'm so glad. [Grace] It's here. Oh, you feel warm. I'll get you a drink. Oh, I'm sorry Harry, would you like a drink? No thanks. Are you leaving? Yes I am. I don't want to get in the way. God be with you. I mean it, Grace. [tranquil music] Sit down, I'll get you a drink. [coughing] Wat...water. Oh, oh I forgot my shoes. Get scared sometimes. Listen to the news everyday, you'd think the world was about to explode. So many countries so angry. So needy. I can't help but wonder what... good are we. With our little vestry meeting, fundraisers. I know you'll probably find this really hard to accept. There are a lot of good people in this country. Yes, you are one of them. Well, we should get an early start in the morning. -You scared? -No. Are you ever scared? No. [clock ticking] [light music] [praying softly] [gasping] [dramatic music] How does it work? If you hug it tight, you press on Christ's chest... [snaps fingers] The blood runs in. Liar. You nearly died. And God showed himself to you. And he said save the people, like I saved you. We should walk in the desert in search of the cross. Not ride in cars. Liar. Liar. Liar! You crook! You filthy, blasphemous crook! [gasps] Oh, Jesus! Listen to me. He told me to save them. He never told me how. You have no pity. No pity for... for those poor cripples. I did it for them. What does it matter if I lied. They're not lying. God damn you. God blind you. God smite you right now! [suspenseful music] [gasps] He will smite me. Not them. They will be healed. I saw the blood. Before you arrived. I thought it was real. I believed in your miracle. I believed in you. [dramatic music] I have only one more day here. And I'm tired. [lively music] -[coins clanking] -[dialing] Hello? We start out at seven. We'll be there by ten. We'll wait two miles outside the village. I don't want any violence. Just take him... and give me my daughter. [laughter] Fine. Fine. [brakes screech] [ominous music] [dramatic music] Mom! What happened? [gasping] Angelito, tell me how you make it bleed. The Devil took Jesus up the mountain and showed him the kingdom of the world. And said: "If thou worship me all shall be thine." [speaking in Spanish] I'm going to eat you raw and I'm going to spit out your bones. Round him. It's a trick. I caught him putting blood in the cross. His own blood. You press on the chest and the blood comes out. It's a trick! He's smart, isn't he? You knew? What did you expect? It's just a piece of wood. He is the cross. [speaking in Spanish] [gasping] Angelito, stop torturing me. [speaking in Spanish] [gasping] [speaking in Spanish] Bring the women. Look at this girl. You were never with a man were you? Always the virgin. But my boys can change all that. Unless you tell us how you make it bleed. -Forgive me, Vera. -I forgive you. I know how he did it. I'll show you. [chanting in Spanish] Why didn't you tell me it was a fake? Why didn't you tell me it was a fake. I know why you didn't tell them. But why didn't you tell me? We could have made it big together. Bring people from all over the south. Mexico, California. Make big money. Is he up there? Don't lie to me again, puto. Is he up there? [Angel] What do you care? You know how the cross bleeds. You can bring people from all over. You won't get your legs back. But you'll make it big. It's not true. It's for you to find out. Like I have. Get the truck ready. [speaking in Spanish] We'll let the lizards chew up his face. [chanting in Spanish] We'll find you after a week Angelito. We'll know it was you by the rags of your cassock. We'll bring you back in a sack. We'll give you the nicest burial ever. With Christ. The King. And your cross. And everytime we make the cross bleed again, we'll pray for the peace of your soul. And we won't tell nobody, that you were not a saint. But just a filthy, cunning liar. Like the rest of us. [yells] Madre de Dios! Get this crazy broad out of here! [shouting in Spanish] Where is Father Angel? They're here. [shouting in Spanish] Father Angel is inside. Begging the Lord for forgiveness for having failed you. The cross bled for the first time. Father Angel was stunned by pride. He believed that only he can bring blood out of wood. Warm and fresh as in the third day! He angered God. And God turned his face against you. And put off the day of the healing. Here is a cross that would bleed at anyones touch. If any man or woman or child has the faith. Demecio, don't be afraid. Even you can do it Demecio. Just hug it tight and pray with all your heart. -Get out of here. -[kiss] [gasps] Brothers and sisters. Here is the proof. We must keep praying and tirelessly gather money to build a shrine for the cross. Don't listen to the devil! We didn't know. I didn't know. He's doing it for the money. He has deceived you! Listen to me! Listen to me. People, thirsty for anyone's blood. Christ's or mine. You were dead when I found you. You moved, you breathed, you moaned in pain, but you were dead. I brought you the cross. I taught you that Christ was one of us... with pestering wounds. With bleeding bare feet. With no money or papers. Whose blood did you put in the cross? -My own blood! -He thinks he's Jesus! I lied to you to give you hope! You saw my blood and for the first time you were not afraid of the police, of hunger or of Don Tarjetos. We want Christ's blood, not yours! That girl who came from the wilderness, saw through my trick but it never defeated her faith. She knew from the start. That this wood... would only be... wood. [crash] [gasps] But she also knew that anyone's blood... is a drop of the blood of Christ. You're bound to my power. They feared my power. She saw through my power, the power of God. She knew that God could fight the damned through a barefoot priest, too frightened, too hungry, too weak... to lead you to the cross without tricks. I don't ask you to forgive me. Just follow me one more time. [overlapping Spanish chatter] You are the rock, Perfecto. Yes, Father Angel. One more time. We will be healed. [speaking in Spanish] [screaming] [gunshot] [grunts] -[gunshot] -[grunts] Get back! Get back! Get away! [people shouting] -[gunshot] -[grunt] [dramatic music] The cross... the cross. Get up. [suspenseful music] Get out of here. -[dramatic music] -[Spanish chatter] [yelling in Spanish] The blood of Christ. [singing in Spanish] [singing hymn in Spanish] [singing continues] It's a miracle! You're walking! It's a miracle! [shouting] [heavy breathing] [mumbling] [Grace] I believe I am so called. Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! Miracle! [thud] [closing theme music]
