I'm gonna kill you. They said the wars were terrible and sectors were built to keep the people safe, led by men who value knowledge and logic, one man called Dominion led people to think he was honorable and honest. Many still believe that. The truth is, he has created anarchy. Over a billion people have been murdered under the hands of Dominion Industries. Growing up, I tried to figure out who I was. Now, more than ever, I don't know who I truly am, but I, along with other deviants, have already been labeled. We've already been cast out. We were the ones blamed for the wars and each and every single day, we fight. We fight for what's right. We fight for our lives. We fight to survive. Let's move. Is this a part of your plan? Where are we going? What now? I don't know. What? You just don't give up, do you? You know, watching you kill those other fighters almost makes me feel bad. Not yet. Not that way. Did you really think defeating me would grant you your freedom? You feel that? That's death creeping in. The end is rising. Don't worry. I'll make it quick. I didn't ask for this. I don't want to do this, but... Dominion will fall. I win. It is revealed. It will return. We are witnessing history in the making. The tale of a young fighter has flourished into a legendary moment. The world's most powerful deviant stands before us. United States has once again proven to be the strongest sector on the planet. I told you she'd win. When are you gonna learn to just trust me? Wow. We're on. Chris. Huh? We're on. Tonight's events will change the world as we know it. Let us recap this year's battles. Please stay with us because when we return, the annual victor walk will commence. And we're out. We need to hurry. It's this way. Trikalypse, Trikalypse, I'm your biggest fan. Trikalypse, I love you! We need a win, Trikalypse. Oh shit. I'm keeping it running. You're coming with us. No. Let's move. Scramble the security teams, sweep the corridor with a UV light immediately. Boo. Sir, they got away. They got away. They have also taken Fresno with them. Is there anything else? We found the body of Major Bid, sir. We were betrayed. Lieutenant Jankins led them to escape. Major Hart, Sir? You're in command now. Assemble Alpha Team and find em. Have my daughters go to the south quarters. Yes, sir. Move out. This is the main entrance checkpoint. Are you okay? No. Yes. I mean, I don't know. I thought sanctuary camps no longer existed. Above ground they're illegal, but we've learned to survive down here. Is that her? Yeah. They've been following you throughout the entire show. Some of them look up to you. We're saved. Others well, they're not so supportive. It means freedom. It's a reminder of why we fight. You and the others are more than welcome to stay for as long as you'd like. You should get some rest. We're still waiting for the second team to arrive. They should be back from D.I. Soon. D.I.? It's our way of saying Dominion Industries. We don't acknowledge his name entirely. Why are they still there? Our first objective was to get you out. The second was to take D.I. down. Get some rest. I'll have someone notify you when they return. There. This is how they treat us. This is where they want us to die. Do not fear. For I am born of death. You have all been trapped in darkness, but you are all much more powerful than you think. Reach down. Reach down into your inner core and live. You will see that they only made us stronger and everything that they have done will turn to ashes beneath our feet. That's impressive. So you're the winner. It's just, I didn't, sorry, I just never thought of you as uh, well anyway, I watched you throughout the whole show. I knew you'd be the winner. I mean the way you took out D.K. was... Don't mind Evan here. This sapian is somewhat of a fan. But... You mean you're... Human? Yeah, one of the few down here. I want to introduce you to someone. Go on. What? All right, fine, fine. Sorry. Dominion Industry's headquarters have collapsed due to a series of explosions. The attack happened less than an hour ago. Authorities are still arriving. The number of casualties is still rising. Again, Dominion Industry's headquarters has collapsed due to a series of explosions, only 24 hours from the previous attack. Authorities believe these attacks are linked to the disappearance of T.V. personality, Chris Fresno. Is it true? It is. Listen. Why? Innocent people are dead. That makes us no better than them. You're right. I'm Calera. I run this place. For us, this is a safe haven, a place where both humans and deviants are one. Follow me, I'd like to show you something. Everything that's happened was set in motion even before the show began. Winning comes with sacrifice. We knew what the consequences would be even before it all started. Were the consequences worth it? We got you out. The second team found her barely breathing along with a few more. How, how is this possible? Seems like she's healing herself from the inside out. Sir. Find them and end them. Bring her to me even if it's her head on a stick. Sir. El. Yes sir? Are you settled in? Yes, sir. You heard what he said, aim to kill. Dead or alive. Oh I can't believe this is it, our first mission. You do understand the importance of this mission, right? You make one mistake and it'll be your head I take back to Dominion. You may be used to the way Bedsor did things around here, but I'm in charge now. And if any one of you make the slightest mistake, you'll be tasting the bottom of my boot so fast, you won't see it coming. All of you have been given a second chance. It may not seem like it now, but you all were chosen for a reason. I could not imagine what you all went through, but you survived and we'll continue to fight and bring down D.I.. Today's events were just the first steps to bringing peace and order to the world. And you? You will be the one that brings an end to it all. How? With violence? By going through this all over again? No. Look, we got you all out. Some of us didn't make it, Dominic, Costa, Alios, Bloodshed, they died for what's right. They died for all of you. Each one of them believed in you. They did what they needed to do for the mission, even if it meant death. Jankins, you guys gotta see this. People of the world, I address you as one. Since the wars, the planet has found a way to survive. It is survival built on trust and order. In the past 48 hours, you have watched a great amount of violence following the actions of some of the chosen deviants in this age of the Immortal Wars. They have caused a great amount of destruction as well as taking the lives of my fellow leaders. What? Which brings me to announce, effective immediately, I am honored and privileged to step up as world leader. These are dark days and those who follow this dark path, your actions are based on misleading beliefs, beliefs that go against the law. Deviants are the reason this planet cracked. We stopped them from bringing us down. We taught our children the right way of life, with peace and humility. Disbelieving in that puts the system at risk. Dominion Industries provides for the people security and order. Without it, the world as we know it will cease to exist. It'd be filled with crime, destruction and death. The individuals you see are not human. They cause destruction. They bring death and that is why, from this day forward, all deviants will be taken into custody. Those who follow their paths will be considered a traitor, traitor to the people. Showing support or displaying civilization with these criminals will be considered an act of treason as well, punishable by death. Justice shall be served. Trikalypse and our fellow futures must pay for what they have done. I promise, to the people of Lambent and fellow sectors, this will end. Hand over Trikalypse, or everyday death shall follow. What's the plan? We continue on. Objective three will commence. Let's go. Hey Charge, looks like we found your match. You got an army around here, huh? I agree with Mr. Tall, Dark and Dangerous here. Come on, man, why? Why what? Why now? Why us? The fact that you are all still alive makes you the group that will save us all. You brought us back to life. We all died already. Yes, I brought you all back, but it can only happen once. It won't happen again. Your death was already gonna happen because of this. What's that? This bug was planted into each one of you during processing. Your death was set the moment it entered your body. He controls it, your strength, power, healing. It was already gonna happen. Once your time is up, it releases a toxic pesticide into your bloodstream that silently takes you out, but for some reason, their system malfunctioned which gave us the window to move in. Unfortunately, it made you all targets, but your bug wasn't set. Dominion knew you would win so he never turned it on. Ah, let me introduce you. Spike, Lucas, Lash, Tiphoid, Ryon, and Edmond, these are your freedom fighters. Freedom fighters, yeah. They've also witnessed the wrath of Dominion. Now, Trikalypse will be leading us. What? Why me? You're the strongest deviant ever recorded. You shook the ground beneath Dominion. You cracked their system. It's true. You're the only one that can end all of this. I believe in you. We Believe in you. El. Yes, sir? Any updates? I was able to track the faint signal a few miles from the east quarters. I'm working on pinpointing its exact location. Patch me through to Hart. This is Hart. Round up a few of the innocents. Sir? Round up a few of the innocents. Make it live. The people of Lambent must know that she's taking our kind down with her. You got me? You're set. It's okay, have a seat. You okay? Yeah. You know, during the shows, kinda had a hard time keeping my composure around you. Yes, slipped a few times. Oh really? Just a little. They're awake. Iro. I'm alive? Yeah, you're back. Yeah, you're back. Looks like the team's now complete. Let me go, let me go, baby no, no. Please. Please get off me, somebody help me! It's okay, it's okay, baby, it's okay. These individuals have had contact with the fugitives. No, nobody's done, no miss, no, baby no. We haven't done anything. Let go. These individuals have committed treason by helping these criminals. That was, let me go. Witness what she is doing to us. She's killing us. She's killing our children. No, oh god, please no, no, no, no baby, look. Baby, look at me. No, no, look at me, look at me! No! She has to be stopped! I will find her and she'll pay for what she did to my family. She's killing us! In a few hours, nothing but the objective will matter. Some will die. Others will continue forward. Prepare yourselves mentally. Physically you're ready. Otherwise you wouldn't be here if you weren't. What you are all about to go through is something that you have never experienced before. All of your powers have been charged. What Dominion doesn't know is that the UV lines and the UV rounds suppressed your powers, made them dormant. But in some way, all of your powers have been charged. All of you have new abilities that need to be discovered. Reach deep inside. Pull out the pain, the anger, all that is inside of your heart and soul and use it. All my fault. It's my fault. You did this. How long have you been standing there? Long enough to see you fly. What? You lifted off the ground. Can you do it again? I don't know. I can't. Yes you can. I know you can. Wow. When did this happen? Oh don't worry, he didn't see anything. Let's suit up. So, Shut up. Sorry. Well well well, looks like little Chrissy's finally up. Hey freak. All right, guys, that's enough. Leave him alone. You're lucky. You know it's people like you that split me and my family up. They were killed by Dominion and his soldiers. That night you came on the nightly coverage and explained that a massive cleansing was successful. This is where you forced us to hide. Our kids aren't able to see sunlight, unable to live a normal life? Just think about that. How did you get all this? Calera's been assembling the team for some time now. Working undercover played a big part in this. And that's where I come in. Before meeting Calera, I got word there was a facility that was genetically enhancing humans, trying to create the ultimate soldier. So naturally, I had to see for myself. I broke into D.I. and did a self-guided tour. Security cameras, hallways, ventilation shafts, Typhoid basically created a map in his mind which we now have. But this map is useless though. The whole facility was destroyed. It was a decoy. That's right. You see the location he held this year's show was at a building Dominion just dressed up for the Immortal Wars. Well, you see, Dominion has these fake distractions built all over the sector. When we got into their system, we discovered that their main headquarters is just south from us. It's the exact same building only, Underground. Oh hell no. Oh no, no, no, it's one thing to be 100 levels up, but to be 100, 200 feet underground, you may as well be walking to your own graves. He's right. That doesn't sound safe. That's why you're not coming with us. You will help us get there. Trikalypse, Iro, Leo and myself will go in. The rest of you, take the exterior. And remember the facility is rigged with security cameras that have all of our faces recorded and targeted. Once we're inside, we have to be quick. We have codes that need to be entered into Dominion's system. Once these codes are entered, it will give us access to all of Dominion's top secret files and will destroy any security firewall. We do this, we expose Dominion Industries to the world. That is the objective. Now we must stay off grid. Dominion has the area tightly monitored so we travel by foot. All right, let's move out. She'll be safe. I'll be waiting at the checkpoint. Sibyl, I never said thank you for everything. It's part of my job. You're not coming with us? No. I don't fight. I stick with what I'm good at, living. Come on, let's get you ready. When you spot the fugitives, you hold your formation and you take no prisoners. Prime targets, Lieutenant Jankins, Iro, Leo, Project Blackout, and Trikalypse. So soldiers, whatever you come across out there, understand one thing, you'll be in a fight like no other. Move out. You heard her, move out. Let's go. Leave Trikalypse to me. But Dominion say to... I'm sorry, say again? Dominion isn't here on the ground. Believe me, if she comes across any of our subjects, she will end us. If you see her, you better notify me. Do you understand? This way. It's roughly 100 yards ahead to the left. Come on. Let's go. What is it? It's a quarantine area. When Dominion's science projects go wrong, he disposes of them. He just throws them out in the streets? It's his way of population control. This guy gets more twisted by the second. Yeah. If we split up, we continue to the checkpoint. Sibyl and the others will meet us there. Let's go. So how do you create it? I can't create it on my own. I can conduct the charge from any power source around me. Have you tried to create it on your own? It doesn't work. I'm sure you can. I had that problem when I was younger. I practiced a lot and eventually, It began to spark. Maybe after all this, I can teach you? I'd like that. Come on. Jesus. No, I don't want to end up like these people. Did you hear me? Yes and you won't, okay? None of us will. How much further do we have? Just another couple of blocks. Straight this way. You good? Yeah. I'm sorry, I have to ask. Are you completely blind? I'm just curious. How do you know where you're going? I see movements, vibrations, sound. It's kind of like radar. Every few seconds, I see vibration waves. That's cool. Have you always been blind? What is it? Hey, I thought I saw, nothing. You sure? Yeah. It's just up here. No, no, no, no, wait! No, no! We have to do something! Okay. Let's go, let's keep moving. What are you crazy? What if there are more of those light things out there? Get it off us, move! This way, come on. This way, this way! Watch out! Go! You are entering a high security area. All citizens must pass through both scanners. Family members must pass through security check. Once you have, proceed in an orderly fashion. Confessions are being taken. The situation is under high surveillance. She's okay, let her pass. We've got movement in quarantine zone three. I got you. I got you. Through here, here! Hello? No! You, you killed her. You killed her, why did you do that? I was trying to help. I was helping her, you killed her. That's enough! That's enough! Come on. Come on, we have to go. We have to keep going. Hey. You okay? Yeah. Come on, let's go. Where the hell are they? Is this it? This is the checkpoint. They should be here by now. The grounds are crawling with guards. We'll have to pick it up at sunrise. You okay? Edmond, where's Edmond? Sibyl. No. No, not Edmond. No please, no please, not Edmond, please, no. No. No, please. No. No. Damage report. There definitely was movement. Radar detected high levels of energy about 40 minutes ago. Scan the perimeter. Yes, ma'am. This is Hart. I was able to pinpoint that signal from the tracker. I'm sending over the coordinates now. Three miles from headquarters? She must have found a way to take it out. Where are you? All right, guys, we'll rest here for the night until things calm down. Get some rest. You all right? Yeah. Hey, hey, look, it's not your fault. You did your best. She was dead before your power hit. Don't worry about him. Every time I use my power, someone dies. It's more like a curse than a gift. Maybe Dominion's right. Maybe I should be locked away or dead. No. No, you don't mean that. I know you don't. You're the reason we're all still here. You need to believe, just like we all do. This is it, isn't it? What do you mean? Those things out there, they were once me. Just another one of their sick projects. It's only a matter of time before I change back to... No. You'd have changed by now. What did they do to you in there? I don't know. My powers went from seeing red to black and white. It's as if they put a veil over me, something took over, something dark. So you did see once. You know what the color red is. You see? All of this blood and death is because of you. What's wrong? Nothing. Let's go. Let's move. Hey man, wake up, we're moving out. Poor guy, died angry. Let's go. Come on. This way, let's keep moving. Hey right over here, stick close. Hey, come on. No, you guys go ahead. Are you sure? Yeah. We both know I don't fight. I'll head back to camp, see if I can help Clara tap into Dominion's system. Let's keep moving. Listen, make sure you stop this asshole. You hungry? We have movement, 30 yards out. They're here. Notify everyone. Mr. Fresno. Glad to see you're okay. No sign of Trikalypse, but uh, the mission wasn't a total loss. We're here to rescue you, sir. Mr. Fresno? Sir, are you okay? It's okay, you're okay. They found our plans. We need to warn the others. There it is, that's how we get in. Let's go. Wait. No, we have to keep going. No. Shit. How did she find us? Well, well, well, if it isn't Trikalypse and her band of freaks. Thanks to our secret operative, we were able to jump in front of your current path. Hey. What have you done? What? A man's gotta survive and Dominion made an offer I couldn't pass up. How could you? Easy, like this. You'll die for this. We are not going with you. Oh really? Says who? It's about time, round two. You seem a bit weak. Why are you holding back? I'm not trying to kill you. I promise I won't hit hard. Is that it, come on! Don't hold back. Go! She's mine. Snap out of it! You're not human. Not your typical human. Stay down or I'll make you. You know, I never understood why you were the leader. You're pathetic. You picked the wrong side, Jankins. Just give it up. There's no way you can beat me. I'm stronger than you. No. Wake up, wake up, Jankins, wake up. No. Hey, we got something. Seems like a pretty big pulse, about three miles from D.I.. Finally, only she can cause such a spike. They are only a couple miles away. Yeah, now we have to figure out a way to scramble security. I have an idea. I can shut down the system the moment they are detected. That'll give em 15 minutes to make their move. After that, they're on their own. El controls everything from the inside and it'll be impossible to stop her. Well then, Trikalypse will have to figure it out. Be ready for when they arrive. What is it? You know we can't stop her. She's programmed to kill. They're walking into a death trap. Yeah, but that's why we chose her. They can do this. As one of his failed programs, you know there's always a glitch. God help them. I can't bury him yet. Maybe Sibyl can bring him back. He's not one of us. We have to try. You be brave, okay? Spike's gonna take you back to camp and you'll be safe. Go. Go now. I can't. Charge? Charge! This one hasn't moved in a while. I think it's expired. What the fuck? Yeah, it's dead. Must have broke its neck in the blast. Cut it down. You're disgusting. Hey! I'm going to kill you. We'll see about that. You really thought you could beat us, didn't you? Subject one, sanitization complete. Subject two, sanitization complete. So what's the plan? You two find the control room, scramble the system, find an exit plan. Me and Iro will go for Dominion. Go. We got this. Oh god. These are humans. He's creating weapons. Let's get the hell out of here. The subjects are in holding. Let's get them transported to separate labs so we can start the draining process. Subject five What? Subject five has escaped. How did this happen? Come on. They didn't make it. We would have received the security alert by now. Please, please. Hey. I got something. Claire, you guys there? Yes, yes. Glad you guys made it. Not all of us. Just me, Lucas, Iro and Trikalypse that are left. Not sure how long we're gonna have a connection. We need an exit plan. Sending it now. Lucas is inputting the codes. You guys get out of there. I got it. We're in. Are you okay? Yeah, I just can't imagine what all these people went through down here. Watch out! Can't you see we should be fighting together? They're trying to kill us. That may be true, but you killed me. So I'm going to kill you. Well, well, well, look who got loose. Help me. All of them? Help me! Get them out of here. Take her with you. Go with them. You win this. You end him. You know, when I first laid eyes on you, I knew you were the one. I knew you'd win. Ah, not so fast. You're one of us. As much as it pains me to say, yes. Yes, I am. Why? Why? You know, I asked that too when I lost her. She was all I had. I had a beautiful little girl, had her whole life in front of her. All she ever wanted was to help people. Ever since she was a kid, all she ever wanted was to see everyone happy. But that all came to an end and I lost her to someone of your kind. Our kind. The deviant population was rising just as the human wars began. It was the perfect opportunity. The government needed to pinpoint those responsible. I saw it as my chance and I ran with it. No hard feelings, just business. Hello father. Hello darling. I was able to save one part of her, the part that would never forget who I was to her. You did all this for her? It makes no difference. The world's gonna know what you've done. Dominion Industries will be exposed to everyone. You think it's easy? For over a decade, Dominion Industries has run this planet. It's not going anywhere, even after I die, it continues on. Now, did you come down here to kill me or are you going to continue to talk all this nonsense? You think I'm going to fight you? No. You're gonna fight them. Typical Dominion, getting others to fight his battles for him. Too afraid to face the fact that you're One of us? Not bad. Now before I let you kill me, I wanna show you something. Yeah, what's that? I need you to see the real me. There it is. Is it over? Yeah. We just got word that D.I.'s files made it out to every sector, every news outlet. Everyone's seeing the truth about Dominion. That's good. That's real good. Come back to me. Uh, how is this possible? I don't know, but you're back. What's that? The new head of Dominion Industries, Lori Harvey, breaks her silence. We'll correct the mistakes made by my father and I promise to help those suffering under the hands of the gifted ones. In other news, the manhunt continues for the criminals which rebel groups have deemed the vanquishers. Fugitives Trikalypse, Iro, Leo and other unidentified deviants are still on the run. It's her. My dear sister, welcome back. I don't think so.
