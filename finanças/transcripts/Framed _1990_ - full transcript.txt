Oh oh oh. Do you think my bath's ready? No, that tub takes forever to fill. I'm going to go and check. I'll get it. Let me get it. Could I have the paper? I need to get ready. Still don't like you going alone. Only we already agreed that I was to leave first. lt's just part of the plan. - See you soon. - Two days. Yup. Yes? Interpol. Open the door. Hey! Stop there! William Adams, I place you under arrest for art forgery. Your buyer Jacques DeLoupe is not a man to remain swindled for long. And his men will certainly find her if we don't. You should think of yourself. Art forgery’s a very serious crime. We could go easy on you. He's thinks it is a coincidence that she's gone, five million francs are gone and he's here. Well then let me tell you, William, that for your accomplice, you were just a paintbrush. Excuse me. Do you think I'm white, professional and attractive? Mmm-hmm. -What's the matter, huh? - Nothing nothing, I'm fine. Where the banner then? The banner. I told you two times. - Put up the banner. Put up the banner. - Okay. Yeah, daydreaming all the time. I'll tell you, buster, you better get with it around here, or you’ll become American history. That's better. Happy hour all night long. Go punch E-7. - Mr. Chew, I don't think these fellas-- - Punch E-7. You see? It's working. I suppose people tell you all the time you look like a paintbrush from the back. My name's Kate. Hello. That's quite a hat. Oh, thanks. Could I have a glass of water, please? Shouldn't I take my clothes off now? Open up. Hang on, hang on. What do you see? Uh, you and a couple of brains. - Notice any difference? - Um, well you're taller. -Aside from height. -Well then, no. Their sex is different. - I bet. - One is male, one is female. But, which is which? Oh, this is-- that's female. Look at the cerebral cortex. That's the little bridge that connects the part that thinks from the part that feels. So you see? Oh. They're the same. No. The male cortex is thinner, weaker. Do you understand what this means? -What? That we’re inferior? -Yes. Look, a woman asks you, "What are you feeling right now?" -What do you say? - I don't know. Exactly. "I don't know." But all the time you say it you feel stupid, insensitive. When the point is we are biologically incapable of knowing what we are feeling. We are not supposed to know. I'm telling you, we are in the clear! This is it! I think. Do you have a bottle opener? Oh here, sorry sorry. What is this? - No no no no, it's-- -Whoa whoa, what is this? - I don't know. -Valentines? Ooh, lip imprints. Locks of hair. How long you going to go on with this? Uh, no, it's just a thing. It's not a thing. It's a-- it's a love shrine. - "A love shrine"? Are you kidding? -Yeah. Okay, this is a-- it's not a love shrine. I mean, Pete, what do you think, that I'm some-- some person who's going to forgive and forget after what was done to me? I mean, if I ever run into her again, anywhere-- a playground, anywhere... she better run, because the fact is I don't know what I'm liable to do. So in other words, this is not a love shrine? To say the least. Hey, Paisan. Buon giorno, buon giorno. Yeah yeah. Yeah, I got also, you know, broccoli. Unbelievable, this broccoli. Size of shrubs. -What those? - Those are real tomatoes. - Uh, what those? - Those are normal tomatoes. I take one box of real and four boxes of normal. And, here ya go. Wait! Non-members must pay a $3 admission. I don't have it. Please, could ya... Come again. Please please. - Louder. - Please! You just stay away from me. You have caused me enough problems as it is. -What? - Oh, don’t think I'll mistake that look of yours for innocence. You Yoknapatawpha did. What I did? Zoki Budek , Geneva. Just a coincidence? Zoki ... Budek ? Zoki Budek ? Look, two people knew I was going to Geneva and I didn’t tell anyone. Well why would I've told anybody? Look, let's just forget we ever had this meeting. I will go on with my life and you can go on with whatever you are doing. Hey hey, wait a minute. You don't know what I did for two years? - By the looks of you, I'd say drugs. - I was in jail. - The cops showed up right after you left. - So in other words, you told DeLoupe where I was in orderto shorten your sentence. I never said anything to anybody and... I thought you, uh... -You thought I what? - Set me up. Oh no you don't. I have just spent two years fleeing for my life from some mad Yugoslavian all because you didn't have the common courtesy to keep quiet. But I did keep quiet. What Yugoslavian? Zoki Budek , DeLoupe's man. You're not convincing anyone by this attempt at stupidity, you know. There's no attempt at stupidity-- Kate, wait wait! Let me explain. Well if, as you say, you didn't tell anyone about me... And I didn't. Well then the source of all our problems is clearly you. - Me? -Well let's face it. If the forgery had been a little better done, DeLoupe would've simply hung it on his wall without calling the police or getting Zoki Budekto follow me - and retrieve his five million francs. -Yeah. -What happened to those francs? - I spent it. - Expenses. -All five million? Well I had to. It wasn't as if I was being tracked down by some conventional killer. I was being followed by a murderer who didn't have a single toe on his left foot. I mean, can you imagine how that preys upon your imagination day after day? The thought of being stalked by a man who's missing parts of his body? You don't always have the presence of mind to check the change and do the bills. So you were short changed out of five million francs by a lot of shop clerks and waiters? Well, it all adds up. So then for fleeing expenses? I see. Listen, do you know what "Hooey" means? Look, the facts can't always be plausible now, can they? I've got to go. It was almost nice seeing you again. Wait wait. Could you give me a ride? You want to be taken for a ride? It's hot in here. - I'll call you. -When? Soon soon. Uh, William? Could I have a word with you a moment? Before you say anything, just let me say that I know what I'm doing. I know it looks like I don’t what I'm doing. I'm just being whipped around, - but actually I do know what I'm doing. - That's good because, actually, it does look like you don't know what you're doing. -Yup, that's right. -And what are you doing? I'm getting her to think that everything's forgiven - and I'll follow her anywhere. - Oh, and did you? Yeah, she thinks I'm as big a fool as I ever was. But of course, I'm not as big a fool as I ever was. Uh-huh? Hello. Kate. No no no, I'm glad you called. Tonight? No, of course I want to see you. Anyplace you want. I don't care. Aces and Eights? Uh, yeah, that's fine. All right. See you then. See, she has no idea who she's up against. Oh, that's good. Hey, ask it how it feels. - Uh, oh oh. - Go on, ask it how it feels. How ya feel? How ya feel? I don't know. - But now, ask it if it's confused. -Are you confused? I don't know. Uh, no. But it's pretty realistic, though, huh? I'm so sorry I'm late. Oh, I'm-- I'm, uh-- fixing my watch. You should really finish that at home where you can get a hammer. You look different. Listen... how do you explain my getting arrested 10 minutes after you left with all the money? How do I explain? Bad luck. For me. lt wasn't bad luck for you. No, I had my own bad luck. Yeah, I know, Soapy Buttock? Listen, you haven't met Zoki Budek . He is very bad luck. Kate, Kate! 10 minutes after you left. I don't know what to tell you. I mean, fate is fate. You can't debate with fate. Not very successfully, no. Let's dance. You still haven't answered my question. I can't dance to this tune. Get our coats. Get our coats. - Excuse me. -Yes? You're sitting on our coats. I just thought I'd let you know that I'm here. That's it. Just so you know. We're not sitting on your coats. If you knew us, you'd know. We do not sit on coats. You know how some people think they’re being watched but they’re not sure? Maybe they're being watched, maybe they're not being watched. They start to go crazy. So I thought I'll let you know. You are being watched. That way, see, you don't have to worry about these things. Hey hey hey! So... how would you say it went on the whole? -What are you doing here? - Need a ride? 'Cause I got the car right here. All right, so you're dancing and you're dancing slow. Uh-huh, and then I went to get her coat and, uh... And you got her coat... - Uh, no. -You didn't get her coat? No. Guess you showed her. She'll think twice before she robs you again. Just keep your eyes on the cab. Why would she park way out here? Maybe she's ashamed of her car. - Then again... - Follow her. -You sure? - Hit it. The thing is that this car is, you know, primarily built for comfort. Stay with her. It's more like a family car. It's, you know, you know, picnics at the beach. Ah. Pull up. And let me do the talking. -What can I do for you gentlemen? - It's okay, we're with Kate. No no no. Woman in the Ferrari's name ain't Kate, pal. -Wanna try again? - She told us her name was Kate. Is this what you fellas do for fun? You find some woman alone and you follow her home? - Look, whatever her name is-- - No no no, you look-- - She doesn't know we’re here-- - No no no, you look, pal! - Did he spit on you? -Yes. Why don't you take your friend here, turn around and beat it? Now! What? Oh. No no no. Her name's not Kate. Lois. Hmm? Oh, Debbie. Babs ... Ralph... My sleeves! Give me back my sleeves! Come back and get 'em, you punk! I really miss my sleeves. Oh, I guess she didn't squander quite as much money as she would've liked. Yeah, I guess not. You know, a lot of women like Kate have to lie. Why's that? Um, because they can't beat you up. Let's go. I mean it's not something I really want to harp on, but, you know, I have an affair next week. What am I gonna wear? I mean it's only a stepmother's funeral, but it's a funeral. You gotta wear black. Wiley, do you hear a harp? Hi darling, how are you? Let's split up. Yeah, then I'll look a lot less conspicuous. Men are biologically obligated to be confused. So the more confused a man is, the more manly he is. I think. Excuse me, folks. If Mr. Shane could please have your attention... Please. I'm here to make an announcement that it pleases me enormously to make. Rather, it pleases us enormously to make. Anna, please. Since you are my dearest friends, I thought that you should be the first to know that three weeks from today, in this very house... Anna shall become Mrs. Elliot Shane. - Time to go, pal. - I have to congratulate the bride. - No, that's Elliot Shane. - Oh yeah? The guy's the head of some really organized crime. So happy for you. Anna. Excuse me, have we met? Elliot, this is Roger. He's an old friend of mine. Oh, Roger. Well, it's indeed a pleasure. Thank you, Elliot. Nice house. Thank you. So you're the guy that finally landed ol ' Anna. Roger's wife was my dance instructor. Is she-- she's here with you? No, no she-- she ran off. Would you like to see the rest of the house, Roger? -Why not? - Follow me. I don't believe that man is a friend of ours. What do you think you’re doing coming in here like this? I just thought I'd return your coat. You could've ruined our entire plan. Our plan? Our plan? Wow. Well if you had waited, I was going to tell you. Tell me what? That you’re a pathological liar? Just come in here, will you? Come on, quickly. I have something to show you. It's real. It took me 10 months to find it, but I did. All we have to do is paint a copy, switch one for the other, and it's ours. I thought, considering things didn't really work out last time, what better way to make it up to you than to do it again? But this time we do it properly, hmm? It was no accident, your finding me. Oh Wiley, let's just do this. Let's have ourselves a happy ending. Don't you think we deserve one after all we've been through? "A happy ending"? I'll tell you what, pay me what you owe me from our last venture and I never see you again. That's the happy ending. - That's what you want? - That's what I want. You honestly think I'll do this, don't you? I mean, you know, I've seen you lying to this Elliot character and I've seen you lie to me. And now I'm supposed to do it all over again 'cause you tell me now we'll be happy and together? Butte will. Butte were supposed to be happy and together the last time. Weren’t we? You know what I think your problem is? Kate, you're an obsessive... lying, swindling, perverted lunatic. Just give me a chance. I'm sorry but I for one learn from mistakes. And I definitely learn from mistakes. He was shaking her down like a-- a-- uh-- you know, a-- a what do you call it? -A-- -A tree? Yeah yeah, like a tree. It's all the rage. I-- I-- excuse me. All right. So, look at it this way, at least now you know. - Now I know. - Now you first have proof-- - Now I know. -And now if you happen to run into her-- I'll bounce off her and keep going. - There you go. - There I go. -Yup. - Here I go. Oh! Oh! When I get upstairs? Know what I'm gonna do? -What? - Break up the shrine. Good good! You wanna help? I got two big kitchen knives-- You know, it's tempting but there’s this guy who has these large shoes -that I really wanna see. - Okay. - See you tomorrow. - Okay. Excuse me. You having some trouble, mister? Do you know who we are? Well you're a bald man and you're-- what is that? Greasy brown? We work for Mr. Shane. Hi-ya! Uh-huh. Okay. -William. - Ellis, Ellis. - Ellis, let me in. - No, I'm sorry. I must stay my course. You were supposed to pay the rent yesterday. I know, but if you let me in the car I'm sure we can work it out somehow. Don’t worry, we're not gonna kill you. Too bad. May I come in? Anna, just want you to know that you don't have to hide anything from me. No, I know. That fellow, the one who knew you from New York, uh, Roger. He's trying to blackmail you, isn't he? You've no idea how kind he once was to me. And now, seeing him again, after all we meant to each other, so cold and uncaring. It's just... It's gonna be all right. Forget this shit. Let's get out of here. Agent Arthur Joak, FBI. Agent Joak? It's Danish. Feels good, don't it? To have your life saved. Happened to me. Best experience I ever had. Yeah, thank you very much. Does feel good. Strange thing, though. Once I was safe, I started to worry how much am I gonna have to give this man? What's this man gonna want me to do? Well what's he want? He wants you to do what you were already gonna do. -Which is what? -Which is... help this girl steal this painting. - Listen, I think you're a little confused. - Now see, if you help her, and help us catch her, know what we'll do? What? We won't send you back to prison as an accessory to grand theft. How that sound? I-- I'd have to think about it. Think all you want. It's me. - Go away. - Come on, open up. Forget it. Hey hey! Don’t fiddle with the door. Hello. I don't want you here. What have they done to you? Honestly, believe me, I didn't know they were going to do this. -Yes yes yes. - Let me help you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. What do you want? What do you want, Kate? Gently. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Gently gently. - Listen, I'm not doing that painting. - That's fine. We'll do whatever you want. What do you want, hmm? Really? Okay, uh, give up the painting. - Okay. - Pack your bags, get out of Shane's and we'll move to a small town near the desert... - Okay. -where you'll work as a... dance instructor. If that's what you want, yeah. You'll do that? You wouldn't mind? Well, of course I'd mind. But... You'll do it. You'll teach the rumba in some little dust bowl just on the edge of the interstate. Oh, why can’t we do this? I have a buyer lined up. Just think how perfect it would be if we could actually get our hands on this thing. Especially after what Elliot's done to you. You're right. lt would be sort of perfect. You mean you'll do it? Really? Yes, I'll do it really. Uh, but it's just business. You don't mean that, though, do you? I want $10,000 now and 70% of whatever you get for the painting. $10,000? Where would I get $10,000 from? Do what you do best. Fine. How come you changed your mind? - I just want to do the right thing, Officer. -And you are. I have always said that if we had a million more like you, just a million more highly principled informants, -this crime problem would be over. - No doubt. But nobody listens to me. Do they listen to me? - No, nobody listens to Agent Joak. -What's the deal? Oh, well first you must switch the painting. That's the main thing. We must have the evidence in hand. - Got it. -And then you bring the girl and the painting back to your place. And then we'll take them off your hands. You comfortable with that? What will--what will happen to the painting? We'll probably give it to the president. Okay, I'll call and tell you when. Ow! So what do you think? You'll do it? You'll give me a hand with this? How can I help you? I don't even know who I really am yet? Hmm. Hmm. Well, gee. I mean do you have any interest in it at all? Can I drive? - Uh, yeah. -All right, I'll do it. Idea. "Idear ." - Idea. - "ldear ." His ideas were incomprehensibly convoluted. His "ideas" were incomprehensibly convoluted. Idea. "Idear ." Idea. "Idear ." You ever read this? Guys in here, they're really crazy. I gotta give 'em credit. What are you doing here? Thought I'd stop by, protect you for a while. So, how's everything going? - Fine. -Your girl, she suspect anything? - Nothing? - Not a thing. You're not losing your nerve, are you, William? What's this? Who's the guy? Your predecessor, Zoki Budek . Zoki Budek ? He’s Yugoslav. You know him? No. He just finished up doing five years at Folsom. See, he refused to turn her in when we gave him the chance. Why is that, you think? I wouldn't know. She really must've spun him around. But I bet he's not so dizzy now after spending five years at Folsom. I'll show you the painting. Clear off the table. Oh yeah. This is good. Real good. Very deft stroke. Oh yeah. Joak is Zoki Budek . He's got no toes. A lot of people have no toes. The guy's a Yugoslavian hit man. Does he sound like a Yugoslavian hit man? - No. - But he looks like a Yugoslavian hit man? - No. - Oh, can't argue with proof like that. No, see Kate told me about Zoki Budek , but I didn't believe her. I have to tell her what I've done and then we all have to leave town. Take the car, please. - Mom Mom Mom-- - Hey hey hey, Pete. - Sorry. -Jesus. I was having a bad dream. What is it? I saw her with Zoki Budek , the real Zoki Budek . You mean Joak ? -What's this? - That's Zoki Budek . - That's Zoki Budek ? -Yeah. Hmm, I guess he's a different type of hit man, huh? No, he's Kate's boyfriend. They're in on this together. -Who told you this is Zoki Budek ? -Joak . And who told you that Zoki Budek had no toes? Kate. So who do you believe? Who do I-- who do I believe? I believe everybody. They're all telling the truth. And they're all named Zoki Budek . It's the Zoki Budek fucking family. And they're all taking turns on me. - That's a good analysis. - Great, so what do I-- what am I supposed to do? What do you feel like doing? How do you like our new bartender? No sad sack like you. Looks very happy. He's gonna cheer this whole place up. You watch. Have a seat. - Pete's our new partner. - Hi. Since when? I decided this was more than a two-man job. You decided? You want the painting, don't you? Look, I'm in charge of this operation, not you. Could you pass me that butter knife? You want the painting? Yes or no? Well, yes, I want the painting. Then you’re just going to have to do as I say. So first we order, and then I'll explain the plan to you. -Yeah, but don't forget to tell her. -What? -About the dog bomb. - No, I won't. The dog-- this is my idea. Dog bomb? You sure they understand the plan? Ask them. Hey you kids know what you're going to do, right? That means yes. I have the wedding cake for the Shane party. I ever seen you before? You're thinking of my step-brother. All right, okay. Dear friends, it has long been my "idear " to marry and share the happiness that I have so long experienced alone. It is idea, not "idear ." ls the cake here? -Wedding cake? - Over there. It has long been my "idear " to marry and to share the happiness that I have long experienced alone. Elliot, perhaps we could try another word besides idea. - Sounded good to me. - Concept. Idea, man, not "idear ." Drop your jaw. Idea, idea, idea. You're out of your fucking mind. Would you like some real cake? Pssst . I think it's time. Ah, there she is. Elliot and Anna have asked us here today to bear witness to their vows of love and fidelity, to their hope of a harmonious future. What must be remembered is that marriage is essentially a union of the soul, which is not to say that marriage cannot be an exchange of money for services, just as long as it's not acknowledged as such. And, if I may, without exhausting your attentions, make my... Get-- get rid of it. Why me? You go. Throw it in the shower. Just grab it! Oh, Jesus. It's leaking something. Most people today think that sexual reciprocity is the key to a successful marriage. I say no to that. It is the ability to tolerate sexual injustice... Whoa! Whoa! ...from which everything grows. Oh my God! Roger, are you all right? Anna, we need you. - Me and the kids. - The kids? Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! I'm here, babies. You do understand, don't you, Elliot? I thought I wanted a new life, but now seeing Roger and the children, I realize that I don't. Well, why didn’t you tell me about this from the beginning? No, I know you’re right. I don't know why I didn't tell you the truth. But, please do say you forgive me, Elliot. Please, please say you forgive me. Yes, Anna. I forgive you. Let's go home. - Bye, Elliot. - Goodbye, Elliot. What should we do, boss? No idea. I have no idea. I mean about the crowd. To hell with them. Serve 'em the food. Well? Well what? Oh! Change. Change. We brought you those clothes. -Just try the thing. -What? - There's been a change in plans. -What do you mean? -Who's that? - Hey, how ya doin '? Agent Arthur Joak, FBI. You idiot! Don't you realize who this is? By the way, you're under arrest. Bet you didn’t think William here could be so-- so wily, did you? Pardon me. I'll need this back. Turn around for a second. What do you think you're doing? Well, you certainly had me frightened... for a moment. I demand that you release me. - Did you hear me?! - Now don't you fall for her sweet talk. - This one, she'll say anything. - Me? This is Zoki Budek ! Too late for that. He's already seen ol ' Zoki . - I'm telling you, this man-- - This man, that man. Why don't you admit it? You hate men. No, I don't. I don't. Watch out now. She's got on her hurt face. The FBI do notwork alone. They work in teams. Ask him where his teammates are? Why don't you ask her how come she has four million francs - in a big Switzerland bank. -You toe less liar. Ask her how come she erased that tattoo from her thigh. -What tattoo? I don't have a tattoo. - She doesn't now. He's not making sense. You can't believe him. She's crying because she lacks credibility, unlike myself. Well? -What should I do? -What do you feel like doing? Sorry for having to put you through this. No! You just had a momentary lapse, William. - I can understand. -You idiot! Sometimes it's hard to see the truth. Especially when you're as stupid as you are. Now tell Peanut up there to let go of the gun. Pete... I told you he was the mad Yugoslav. Well, actually, I'm more strange... ...than mad. Now put your other arm through that hole. Easy now. Let's not be rash. - I'll spray her. I will. -A painter like yourself wouldn't destroy a masterpiece like that. No, you forget, I'm a frustrated painter. Now give me your gun. You give me the gun and I'll give you the painting. Well, I can accept that. Trust just ain't what makes the world go round. So sad. You are so stupid. "Agent Joak." Yeah, well... I trusted you and all the time you were preparing to hand me over to some professional psychopath. -You're a hard woman to believe. -Why? Why why why is it so hard? 'Cause basically you’re a thief and a liar. I'm a thief and a liar? What are you?! I'm a reluctant thief and liar. Oh, nice distinction. What's in that box? I think it's kind of like a-- - a mocha cream-- - Pete, Pete. - Is it real? - No. It's a painting. You knew all along that Joak was Budek . Not all along, no. Wait a minute. if this is the real one and Joak has the copy, what was left at Elliot's? I painted a second copy. You didn't. What was that? Do you have, like a hammer? Do you have a gun or something? Something? - Kate? - Kirby. - Hold it right there, Kirby. - Leave your hands where they are. - But you don't know where his hands are. - That's true. It's the other Zoki Budek . Let me introduce you to Kirby Lyons. He's here to buy the painting. Can you prove that to me? Oh, sorry. Was that your foot? So now what have you got to say for yourself? -What, if I wasn't so proud? -Yup. I'd apologize. Well if I wasn't so proud, I'd apologize too. So do you trust me now? - No. -You don’t trust me? Then you must love me. It's beautiful, Kate, but it's also a fake. No, it isn't. Yeah, it is. It's a fake. - The best I've ever seen. - Hey. He hasn't seen your fakes. I can't believe that Elliot's was a fake. You must have given Budek the real one. Oh, no I didn't. What are we going to do now? Wiley, so look what I've got. These are absolutely great. Uh... I wanna-- I wanna buy the Modigliani. I don't know. The damn things are all fakes. I know that. But they’re real fakes, aren’t they? Oh, absolutely. No, this is, uh... this is real. I can guarantee that this is authentic. Can I trust them?
