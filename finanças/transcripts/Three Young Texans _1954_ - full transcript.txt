* THREE YOUNG TEXANS * Thieves! Come back, Rusty! go to the flock! Disperse! Get out of here! Gather them and take them to the flock! Hey, good shot, Rusty. These thieves were trying to steal our cattle from us. Next time, stay away. I don't want to see your hair flying around. You don't have to worry, Johnny, I always walk beside her. Yes, calm down, Johnny. It's okay, Rusty Yes, daddy. The old master forced them to flee. They almost took his head off. Of course not. It was not. I lost it with the wind. Ms?... Your hat. Thank you, Tom. Rusty, stay with the flock and don't leave. Come on. Come on, George. Yes guys! What? It is best to prepare and notify the rest of the group. Daddy will pay and we can go have fun. Let's go to the saloon! Are you going to play all 6 again? No. I have a new system. I bet on red. Double or nothing. I will take everything to win. I'll be there to see you lose your shirt. No woman is allowed to enter the saloon and play. That will take care of you Rusty. Number six. Black. Place your bets, gentlemen. Make your bets. Number 22, black. Jane comes here!... I'm going to be very lucky, dear. Ah, cheer for me, dear. Double zero black... Black has come out four times. But we still have something. Place your bets, gentlemen. Place your bets. Let's bet everything on the red. Baby, are we committed to betting on 22 again? I don't usually bet on the same number twice. Bet double zero. Okay. Ten on double zero. Double zero. Baby, you give me luck! Sorry, Tony. Next time. Johnny, leave me 60 bucks. Money from the sale of cows. With $ 60 you can buy three cows. Johnny, if you want to have your own flock, you have to play. This is our hypothesis. If we're lucky we can buy a good ranch. We have been partners for a long time. I have the right to choose the number. Don't do that. It will be number 4. Rusty's birthday. Don't you have anything against that number? No, but I think it's out, it's going to be 37. The number four. Black. We did it! We multiplied our money! What we have is 34 calves. Take the money and play again. We can make a fortune. Come on, come on. Put it here before you go crazy. You will lose everything. It's a girl! Nick, Harry. Take this girl out. She cannot be here. I'm already happy. Come on guys. If you don't mind, Tony Blair, I'm going to look for my dad at the station. And come home with him. Okay, Johnny. If you can't go today, come back tomorrow. We are going to get away with it. Thanks. Good luck. Don't forget to come tomorrow, there's a dance tonight, Johnny. We meet there, Johnny. You can pick up Rusty and take her to... city since you live alone? We see there. I hope Johnny doesn't forget to say to your father that half the money is mine. What do you mean? You know what your father is like. Every penny he throws. He always ends up losing. Like someone, that I know, huh. Come on. What are you doing, Charlie? Riding your father's saddle, Johnny. I think you're in the mood to go home. Hello, dad. Son, how are you? I hope you haven't had any problems on the road. It is not what you think. We found some thieves. They failed to take anything. Rusty shot one. Typical of Rusty. I'll go home with you. I'm sorry, son, but I want to take care of things. Our checks have arrived, Jim Sim is all on the table. Thanks for saddling the horse Charlie. See you tomorrow. Tell your mother not to worry if I'm late. Are you going to cross Rio Grande? There is no law that prevents a man from playing poker. But we cannot start a new Herd by risking everything at the border. I lost everything to the game. We will recover in the same way. There is a place for me. We don't play on credit, Jim. Cash only. Let's see what it says when I see my salary. I always had a weakness for money. Oh Mack!... Mr. Colt plays. Take good care of him. We have some good memories. 70 dollars. Cut. Today is my lucky day. I will recover everything I owe. The money is on the table. We just need good cards. For you my friend. Thank you sir, thank you very much I said this was my lucky night. What are you going to do, Colt? Recover, your money in a single match? Thanks. Tomorrow I'll change the night shift. Let's start. Valete. King. Lady. And so. I put it, five dollars. I will. Five and... five more. I will. Five and ten more. I see. The aces are back, aren't they, McAdoo? I keep. Turn. The next card is. Seven, jack. What you say? Valley. 20 dollars. I see. Step. King. Go... I will increase it to 50 dollars. I don't think there are three aces. His fifty plus a hundred. It is also my lucky day. Do we continue? Ok. There you go. Three aces beat three kings. You had a hidden ace, you son of a bitch. But are you crazy? Get him out of here before the Sheriff arrives. What's going on, dad? Johnny, I have matters to discuss. Go and tell your mother that I'm going. Who is it? It's my son. How's McAdoo? Joe is going to come to the barn. Relax, Jim. It is going to be alright. Jim is looking forward to hearing what happened last night. Sit down, Jim. McAdoo died. Your bullet killed him. He's wanted for murder, Jim. McAdoo is American, Jim. Your killer will be wanted on both sides of the border. But it was in legitimate defense. He shot first. You saw everything. What are you talking about, Jim? You saw everything. Relax, Jim. We told him that the killer is a stranger named John Smith. Yes? I have to thank you for that. Grateful or not, we'll have to settle the score. Sure, Joe. You know, I am one of your men. You said you worked at night, right? Yes, I was leaving right now. The West leaves for Twin Buttes Flye tonight. It takes 50,000 dollars to pay, to the Army in step of Puerto Rico. Are you going to steal it? Aha. With your help. With me? Oh no. Do not. So we have to say that John Smith's name is actually Jim Colt. And who shot McAdoo first. We will tell the Sheriff. And you will be in prison very soon. What do you want me to do? The train will depart at 7:30 am and will pass through Twin Buttes. This is the season. Here is a watchman. When you enter the main car, we will be here. Tell us what you have to do. I go to the main car, knock on the door and I tell the person in charge that I have important mail and that I have to go up. And then we entered. Hey Joe, what if the railroad doesn't send payment tonight? Won't that happen, Jim? The company has always followed the rules. Tonight, Flye will take 50,000 dollars, to pay the soldiers first. Are you going out with Rusty and Tony to the dance? Yes, I think so. Why are you worried, son? With nothing. I was just thinking. I have to go to the station. But first you have to have dinner. I have no time. Are these men gone, father? Yes, they already are. Who were they, Jim? Leave me, Martha. Leave me that way!... Ah!... I don't understand it anymore. It is not the same as before. Great, Bill! There is time for coffee. A train thief. I don't know the combination of the safe. Shut up, go to the box. Sorry, I don't know the combination. Go to the box. But, I, I... I... I don't know the combination, sir. Remember if I will be fired for this. I swear that... The rest in cash. Put it there. Open the door. Pull the emergency brake and lie on the floor. The wires are cut, Joe. I... I better go. Don't forget anything, Jim. What is it? Is nervous? It's the first time. Anyone would be nervous. Remember what happened to McAdoo. But... Something is wrong. They stole us! What? They took everything! All the money! A man came and knocked on the door. I thought it was Billy. It took everything. I had to apply the emergency brake and it came off. You must call the Rangers to come. Come on, come on, Jim. Quickly. I can't communicate. There is no dial tone. I took a look, Joe. The safe is empty. We must cross, Rio Grande. We will wait a few weeks for the dust to settle. Let's try again. Who do you like to dance with? With you and Johnny. Forget Johnny. He is not here. Johnny's at the farm. You are worried about something. I think I'm right. I care about all my men. I think I have to dance with my girl. Johnny!... What is it, captain? Some cows escaped and I had to go after them. So I was a little late. Be careful where you step. I know. It's to scare you. What about Mr. James? I think I can handle it. I thought you weren't coming. I'm dreaming. Attention. Listen, please. A thief broke into the train between Customizer and Twin Buttes. He escaped with the sum of $ 50,000. He must be close. I need men, in addition to my assistants, to capture him. Please raise your hands, men who can ride. Okay Sanders, but that's what it looks like... Johnny!... but Stilman, and you have to do it!... I'll see you in my office in ten minutes. Thank you guys. Well, at least you danced half the dance. Just one thing before you go, can you give me half of my winnings? You will have to wait. I have no money. I know. Do not provoke my weaknesses. We have been partners for a long time. See you later, Rusty. Take care, Johnny. Of course I miss you, especially when he takes you home on the back. We have no reports of strangers, so the thief must be from the area. We will check all the farms and see if the owners give us an explanation of what they did at 7:30. Come on, gentlemen. On the march. Good morning Dad. I will eat something before I start. Ah!... Tony Royfiller told your mother yesterday that you joined the search. Is there a clue to the thief? Helpers still continue to search the farms. They believe that the thief must be from the area. So see you soon son. You are wasting your time searching the farms. No one in the field could have done that. I suppose you are not going to ask here. Hope not. There will be no troublesome questions to your own brother. There's something wrong, Dan. No. We're just checking. Tell me, Jim, did some cows go astray yesterday? Well I do not know. Maybe, everything goes well in the corral!... I always have to keep an eye on them. Dad. What? Yesterday you didn't make it to the ball before ten thirty. I said that sooner or later you you would have to explain the missing cows. I would never lie to a friend. Where were you, Johnny? Ah, just walking around. You have to tell us, son. I was walking. Sorry, Johnny. I have to take him for questioning. I know where he was. Yesterday we won 700 dollars, at the Lady Lucky lounge. I wanted my half of the money and he wanted to buy cows. What does this have to do with where he was last night? When we were little, we had a cabin in Red Canyon. This was the place where we hid our treasures. Of course he went there, hide the $ 700, afraid I would spend it. You should have cleaned your boots before you entered the ball. Red Canyon is the only place where the clay is red. Did you understand all this, Sheriff? You are afraid that your partner will steal your money. Isn't that so, friend? Yes it's true. Do not know. It's a little suspicious. No, it's not. Tony insists that Johnny's money... Rusty!... No confusion. If you don't believe us, Sheriff, you can go to the canyon and check. Get on your horse, Johnny. It's over there, Sheriff. Ahead, Johnny, show us. You can do it. See what I mean, Johnny? Here he is, Sheriff. Just a moment. Let me have a look. You know how hard it was to get all this money. Convinced Sheriff? Convinced. You'll have to find another Johnny hiding place. Don't worry, I will do it. Give it back to me. Aren't you going to share now? I caught. I know another place where there is no clay. Keep this until we can buy the calves. How about it, Tom? Allright Sir. This way their mothers will grow up strong and give a lot of fat and creamy milk. Tony, you're going to feed him. Mothers are starving. Don't let Tony touch my money. I will save it right now. Hey Johnny... how many cows do you expect to buy with $ 700? Oh, maybe 34 or 35, with luck. How about if I give you 40 cows for that money? Don't you think there are few cows, Mister Blear! Thank you for that!... What are you going to put in your iron, Johnny? The Best of Texas. Flye, flying. "Flying?" Where did he get the name Flyer? A way to sweat, hey, partner? Yes of course. I was surprised to see all that money. You look worried. You don't need to be. What kind of partner did you just become? Steal $ 50,000 and leave me out of business. Where is the money? Close to where it was. Because? Are you feeling lucky to play Lucky Lady? I have other plans. We both have them, friend. I will return it to the railway. Return to the railroad? Are you crazy? Tell me where he is. Listen, we are partners. We have $ 50,000. Nobody suspects anything. We only have to be quiet for a month and then go to California. To buy our own ranch. It's the opportunity of a lifetime! Where is the money? With this money, I'm going to California! That's better. Can someone tell me what this is? It's Johnny, he's an idiot. I am waiting. I will take care of the horse. I know why you were fighting. Yes? You were about to shoot the sheriff this morning, if they had found, more than 700 dollars. I know, Tony is hiding something to protect you. You wanted him to return it. And that was why they were fighting. I told the sheriff what happened. I did not want it to be like this. Sorry, Rusty. It's gonna be okay. What did you do, Johnny? I have my reasons. It hurts me, Johnny. It really hurts me. Good afternoon, Mr. Hanks. I want to see the silver button shirt. Hmm, you need a new shirt, Tony. I'll show you. He arrived from St. Louis last week. It's for me. I am able to read, I am smart. It's 20 dollars, huh. Do you mind if I try it? Use the office, my son. Thanks. Don't forget to lower the curtain. There are ladies. Who do you think I am? Hello Hanks. Hi, Dan. Do you want snuff? A pair of bags. Take it off yourself. What do you think of my new shirt, Sheriff? A little modern. It's 20 dollars. New and shiny. And this too. Where did you get them, Tony? Men have a right to have money, Sheriff. Someone stole a lot of money and silver dollars. There are all kinds of dollars floating around. Maybe, but this morning you were penniless. Rusty gave me part of what Johnny and I have. I'll ask Rusty to find out if she really gave it to you. Do you suspect me, Sheriff, what if it was Johnny and not me? As you said yourself, many suspects for one day. You will have to accompany me to be questioned. Half is mine. We will have 20 more cows for us. Jeff always did good things for his neighbors. He's a good man. You only have to go to work in an hour, Jim. I have a lot of work this morning. I have to go. Joe wants to talk to you. He's waiting on the river. He's angry. You think you cheated us, Jim. Why do you think that? You entered your house yesterday before going to the station. Joe thinks he told his son that he stole the money. You tell Joe that you're crazy. Don't commit suicide, Jim. Is something wrong, dad? Don't mess with yourself, Johnny. I'm with you. Stop bothering my dad. Do you know the Apache gang, boy? Of course, train thieves and murderers. If you want your dad to stay alive, you better let him come with me. My boss is Apache Joe. As I said, I'm with him... Jim, Johnny! They are well? Okay, Martha. It was a stray bullet mom. Assemble. Be careful with your son, Jim. I put a rope around your neck. We have seen each other again. Tell Apache Joe that we will wait. What friends do you have, ah dad. We will certainly return, to see Apache. What do you know about this, my son? Enough. Tell me, why didn't you tell me about it? I shot an American at a poker game on the border. He drew it first. Apache Joe and he, are the only witnesses. And since that time have you been blackmailed? Yes son. The train theft was your thing. Now I have two things to do, dad. You saw Tony. No. What happened? He's gonna be in trouble if I don't find him before the Sheriff. Wait, I'll go with you. Calm down, partner. It's me and Rusty. Couldn't you wait for payment to buy a shirt? Pretty, huh? The Sheriff went to the ranch, and asked me if I gave you any money from Johnny. What did you say to him? Nothing. I was in my room when I heard him talking to my dad. This is my girl. Here, so I can tell you, I gave you some of Johnny's money. I just hope they don't ask me when. I wouldn't have to lie. I have a better idea. Let's get the money and dig for California. Now is not the time to be funny. I know that Johnny prefers to return the money. But I think it would be better to take $ 50,000 to California. Now, think about it. Rancho would have the best money can buy. What do you say, Rusty? It may not be very smart, because I'm a little confused. Where is the money? This way. I'll remember, when I'm alone. You don't have much time with the sheriff chasing you. You will stop chasing me like that, crossing the Rio Grande. I can get there. And then I'll be back with the money. You're wrong, partner. I will stay with you as your shadow. I have a gun and you don't. I'm warning you. I will use it, if you try to get the money, to go to California You'll have to sleep at some point. I'll tie you up first. There is one thing, that I don't understand. Just return everything. You don't need that money. For God's sake, why are you doing this? Yes tell him, Johnny. I also liked to know. Sorry, Rusty. If I tell the Sheriff that the money was found by causality we could chase the cows again. Tu decides, Tony. Ah, ah!... If Johnny went to Rusty instead, what would you do. But you are not and I don't think I will, my hands on $ 50,000. You can never escape with them. I am your shadow. Come on, you will get tired of eating beans and omelets. Goodbye, Rusty. I will try to make sense of this big head. Flye, the best iron in Texas. I understand. Rusty, the sheriff wants to ask you a few questions. Sure, Daddy. You should already know what I'm asking, Tony was given part of Johnny's money. Yes, I gave you a share. So, because Tony, he didn't confirm this to me right away. Maybe he wanted to be alone. It is a serious matter. Sure, Daddy. Why do you suspect him? You know how crazy he is. Johnny didn't come to work this morning, do you know why? Rusty, yesterday I went to the farm to see Johnny. My brother Jim told me that he had seen her... but I didn't know what I was going to do because I left them. After hearing that Tony was in trouble, I went to tell Johnny to see if he was able to make him see reason. For God's sake, for a little lie you treat them like West Flye thieves. We know that Tony didn't do it, but he knows something. We have to get to the bottom. Any more questions, Sheriff? Not yet for now. Maybe later. By the way, Rusty. The railroad, offers a reward of $ 5,000 if they return the money. Why do you tell me that, Sheriff? You're welcome. It's just to let you know. Only that. Hey, what's going on? What was this? "A revolution? No, just children. Have you ever taken a good nap? It's not very good with you by my side. What time is it? It's almost night. I'm going to untie you to go eat a plate of beans and pancakes. Thanks. Pretty, huh? How about it, divide it between the two of us, do you think it's fair? Why don't you stop saying nonsense? We have $ 700 to start a new herd and trouble with the law. It's all right. The only problem is Rusty. It's a good life. Rusty said it would. We need to talk. I don't know why, actually. It's with Apache Joe. You are wanted for murder, among other things. And that is your accomplice. And your hand? I hope you're feeling better. Out. Come on. Your father has our money. We will write you a note. Tell him to give us the money or he won't see you alive anymore. He did not betray you. I was in the barn and I heard everything. I took the money so he wouldn't be involved in the train theft. Now I understand... Shut up! where is he? In a safe place. Wait a minute! You are dealing with the wrong man. I helped Johnny steal the money from the train. He wanted to return it. So I hid it in a safe place. And I don't plan on returning it. Lie. Do not believe? Yes. Look. New and shiny. It is part of the treasure. I made a mistake. I went to buy a new shirt. The Sheriff caught me and is now looking for me. What is your name? Tony Ballew. An interesting name. Take us there. In a few weeks, when you get tired of chasing me, we will go. Okay, boy. In the meantime, come with us. Good. As soon as I release Johnny, I will go. You and I will have time to discuss your part. It's ok. Don't be stupid, Tony. All you're going to get from Apache Joe is a bullet. Ah!... You're wrong. I am or the only one who knows where the money is. I am the boss in this business. And by the way, Johnny and I don't have the same opinion on financial matters. But it's my partner... and if something happens to you, nothing done. You heard that, guys. Treat it with care. See you again in California, partner. Hold his arms. Did you want to know how it was, my hand boy? We were advised to treat you with care. He's had enough. We will. Come on. We need to talk about money. Where did you hide the treasure? I just want to know where it is. We have to make plans. In a place in Red Canyon. Red Canyon? This is 10 kilometers east of Maverick and three kilometers north of Rio Grande. This is right!... We'll take the money tonight. I already told you that you are in a safe place. Shut up, I know, boy. But, if there is a big fire in Maverick it can certainly be seen 20 miles away. This will get you there. We cross the Rio Grande, we escape through El paso We enter Maverick from the east. Not with me. Maverick is my hometown. Everyone knows me. You'll come with us to Maverick, boy. Tied in the saddle. Johnny, Johnny. Are you hurt? What happened? We were at the bar and we met a bandit named Apache Joe. Apache Joe? Where's Tony? They offered $ 5,000, to whom to return the money. We can convince you to return the money. If we find him. It was with the Apache Joe gang. Where's Johnny He did this to save me and to get rid of me. He thinks he can finish Joe and keep all the money. But you will never escape it. The last thing he said to me was: "We'll see you in California, partner". It's Sheriff Johnny! Run! I have to rescue Tony from Joe, before he's killed. I can't get away. Are you alright. It's a little late, Rusty. Your father must be worried. Did you find Tony? I lost track of Dorothy. I think he has already crossed the border. You've wasted a lot of time going alone. I also want to get my hands on that "dough". And why? So you don't know who I am, the bad guy who stole West Flye. Ah!... Sorry, Rusty. They would find out sooner or later. I have been hunting bandits for a long time, Son. But it is the first time that one voluntarily confesses. I have my reasons. Is it true that you offered $ 5,000, to anyone who returns the money for the theft? That's right. But you cannot receive them. Tony can. If you want to recover the money, worry about finding it. He's the only one who can tell you where he is. Burn! Yes, this will attract the Sheriff's men. We will give you a few hours for them to come. Then, we go to the north of the canyon and we will enter in the east at dawn. I like to ride with you. Genial was recognized in Maverick. That was what you wanted, wasn't it? To make sure you were with us. What do you think? I know what to do When will you release me? When will any of the Sheriff's men meet us? Release it, but do not lose sight of it. What happened? Strangers started shooting and setting the barn on fire before they left. One of them was Tony Bellow. Are you sure it was Tony? Of course yes. He rode alongside Apache. Johnny, come back or shoot! Don't get involved in this, Rusty I'm already in it! What is it, Son? Why aren't you at the station? I was worried about you. I asked Charlie who relieved me. Johnny, where have you been? You're hurt. I'm fine. I don't want you to get involved in this. Be nice and don't ask me questions. I need blankets, quick. Rusty, give me the gun. Yes, here you are. I'll take the shotgun. I like to see where I aim. I'll get the blankets, son. Listen, Rusty... I'm with you. Don't argue. I'm happy to be, Mrs. Colt. Thank you, Rusty. It's in the closet. Johnny, are you sure I can't do anything? I started this. I have to put an end. Quiet, Johnny! Turn around and raise your hands. Sorry, Johnny. But I have no choice. Do you think you are being fair Sheriff? I have to arrest him for helping a fugitive. You cannot put a woman in your prison. It is true... but the state will pay the transfer, to Dimas prison. Don't move, Dan. Don't make me shoot. Now, take off the handcuffs. Johnny confessed to stealing West Flye. Defending him will only get you into trouble. Also think of Martha. I should have done it a long time ago. Put them in it. Where are we going? Rescue Tony before they kill him and run away with the money. A man to be a sheriff does not mean that he is not human. Sure, Rusty, but in this case I can't do anything. Johnny stole the West Flyer. He committed a crime. Sorry, but I know that Johnny tried to return the money. So why did they attack the convoy? Do not know. I only know about Johnny. Rusty, I'm a little confused. Are you confused? How do you think I feel? I'm in love with that cowboy. I will tell you why he did it. I shot an American named McAdoo at a border game of poker. He died shortly afterwards. Apache Joe and some of his men were the only witnesses that McAdoo had drawn first. They came and blackmailed me. I was about to help them steal the train at Twin Buttes. Well, Johnny heard the plans, to elaborate and to save my skin, he stole the train first. Johnny, committed a pious crime to... to get me out of the quagmire. Jim, I understood everything, except one thing. If an American is killed at the border Mexicans notify immediately. I did not receive any reports from McAdoo. You have to believe me. You better shoot first. If we don't free Tony, takes care of uncle. From here, we have to go on foot, Jim. First, we need to talk about the division of money. We will divide it into four parts. You know, I don't remember where I hid it. When a man is in danger, he remembers everything much faster. Many have fallen over these hills, boy. As I said, we will divide it into four parts. Is correct!... Are they. Who's the other one? It's McAdoo, the one I thought I killed. Because you have another opportunity, father. Here they are, $ 50,000. Johnny, watch out! Hide in the rocks! I caught you bastard. Did they hit you? It was just on the shoulder. I will not see California, partner. That scoundrel will pay me. I'll take care of him. Stay here, father. Johnny!... Johnny!... Oh Johnny!... This is me, partner. Oh Johnny!... Sheriff... I stole Johnny's "dough". He wanted to return it. Rusty, take care of Johnny. Tell him I'm sorry. If you take these damn handcuffs off I can help. Where's Johnny? He went to the gorge, behind Apache Joe. Give me your gun, Jim. Do not. If Johnny is alive, I want to see him cross the border safely. If not, I'll go after Apache Joe. Ah!... I just want Apache Joe. We will do this together, Jim. How's Tony? Is dead. I have the money to return it. And Apache Joe? Back there. I was trying to cross the Rio Grande. Are you going to arrest me? I do not!... You know I finally have this matter all cleared up. Apache Joe did a lot of robberies. He could steal the West Flyer. But I confessed. And I did it. Yes, some guys confess to crimes they didn't commit, to become more famous and more important than they are. No, Johnny. My job is to arrest bad guys. As far as I know, the real bad guys were Apache Joe, Catur and McAdoo. And they are dead. I don't think the railroad has anything against man, who captured Apache Joe and recovered the money. And I thought I wasn?t human. No, Ah!... I think the reward, of the $ 5,000 of the theft... that money must go to the city, which Apache Joe set on fire. Good!... but if I remember correctly there is a reward $ 10,000 for Apache Joe. Dead or alive. Now they are yours!... And you can buy a lot of cows for your Johnny ranch. Ah, you better take Rusty home. Your father must be very worried. Tony said he would forget about "pasta", if our lives were in danger. Do you remember? Yes. "THE END"
