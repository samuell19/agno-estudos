Ahem. Sam and drew... There are so many things I want to teach you, so much advice that fathers pass down to sons, but if you hear one thing from me... Hear this... You are loved. My husband, the father of my two sons, the love of my life, died on Christmas day. He had been sick for two years. What are you guys doing under here, huh? Come here. Come here. I love you so much. It's gonna be okay, okay? The earth kept turning and life went on around us as though nothing had changed. But, for me... Everything had changed. "Where did he go?" I kept asking myself. I couldn't reconcile his absence in my brain. I wanted to know... Where did he go? I felt lost and alone in my own home. This is harder than it looks. Ouch. What? Just joking. You're doing a great job. You rat. You scared me. Thank you for taking care of me. Thank you for letting me take care of you. Peach? I can't die on Christmas. You'll go when you're called. But I don't think that's today. Okay? Happy new year's, pattie. Are you getting ready for your trip? Oh! Yes. It's gonna be great. How are you, Gina? We want to have you and the boys over for dinner, okay? Thank you. Come on, guys. Good morning, kell family. I just wish people would stop doing that. They care about you. They just don't know what else to do. I know, and it's... I'm so grateful. I just... i... Have you... have you found a replacement for pattie yet? No, not yet. Well, I was thinking about applying for the job. It'd be great to be busy, and I could be here just in case my boys need me. You'd be perfect. Frankly, we'd be lucky to have you. Okay, boys, let's go. Bye, guys. Okay! Hurry up. Go straight to your room. How can I possibly be late? I only hit the snooze button twice and I made instant coffee, which, by the way, tastes like a brown crayon. Sorry. What can I do to help? Please just give me something to do so that I do not feel so useless. Oh, you've already done so much. Oh, you know what? There is something you can do. I want to stop the meal delivery service. I cannot look at that red cooler on my porch another day. I can whip out a text, blast a Facebook post and a tweet, before you can even stop me. Thanks. I just, I want to cook for the boys, I want things to be as normal as possible. Of course you do. They've been so brave. Please don't cry. I am not crying. I can't cry. I am too dehydrated from a lack of caffeine. Let's go get some coffee. Yeah. That'd be great. See you later, pattie! Bye, you guys! Bye-bye. Lesson one. Always tell the truth. Be an honest man. Let your words stand for something. It isn't always easy to tell the truth, but, in the long run, you'll find it's the only way to live a happy, peaceful life. Now, everything works around this main calendar. Red is for national holidays, green is for religious holidays, yellow is for half-days and teacher conferences, and white is for school assemblies. After each teacher takes attendance, they will send you their list so you know who's absent and you record it... here. I always like to wait a little while, in case kids straggle in late. You see what I mean? That's Michael spehn. Cathy's still in the hospital. She is? She was at Matt's funeral. They were old school friends. She was fine then. Well, she went into the hospital last week with a headache. A headache? Yes! I'm sure she'll be out soon. I mean, she's young and healthy. What can happen? I'm so sorry. That was... It's alright. You're right. I'm sure she'll be fine. Nobody's hungry? I miss daddy. Me too. Me too. You know what I think would make this dinner way more yummy? Some giant marshmallows. Why don't you guys stay here and I'm gonna go down to the basement and see if we have any. I'll take the elevator. Ding-dong! Mm-mm-mm-mm... Nope, we're all out of marshmallows, but for little boys who eat their dinner, there will be ice cream. Hello? Are you busy? Hey, Colleen. No, no, we're just, uh, we're in the middle of dinner. Have you heard what happened? Did I hear what? It's Cathy spehn. You guys eat up, okay? I'll be right back for ice cream. What happened? She's... gone. Matt's old and dear friend, Cathy spehn, after less than three weeks since prognosis, had left behind three motherless children. You okay, son? No, dad, I'm not okay. You will be. I just feel like I'm forgetting something here, there's something I should be doing. It's all done. There's nothing to worry about. We just... We got to get your shoes on and get you and the kids to the church, okay? I'll be downstairs. At first, I couldn't cry. I was numb... Tired, empty. Life had been everything that I had ever hoped for. The engraving on our wedding rings read: "Live, love, laughter." And that was Cathy. How could I go on without her? The news of another family suffering so close to us sent me back into the darkness. I kept thinking of Michael spehn and how shocked he must've been feeling. I had at least had some time to prepare. I felt compelled to attend the funeral, to reach out. It was as though destiny was drawing us together. You don't have to be here. People will understand. Good morning, Michael. How are you holding up? Yeah. I'm fine. We're all praying for you. How does that work, exactly? What do you mean? I prayed really hard for Cathy to get better. So what happened? I mean, I didn't pray hard enough? Is that it? Maybe if I did a better job, I could've changed god's mind and Cathy wouldn't have died from an inoperable brain tumor? Is that it? Michael, I know you're angry, and I don't blame you, but you can't assign human logic to divine matters. "Divine matters"? Do you know what Cathy said to me the day before she died? "Why would I have been given babies if I wasn't gonna be around to take care of them? I'm sorry. Right. Thank you. She spoke to me at Matt's funeral. And she invited us over. We could've been friends. Gina kell? Yes? Are you Gina kell? Yes. You're Michael spehn. I'm so sorry for your loss. Thank you for coming. Can we speak after the service? For just a moment? Of course. Thank you. So, you're farther along in this process. Can I ask about your kids? How they're doing? You can lie to me. They're grieving. They just miss their dad, but... They really are okay. Cathy had talked about Matt. I have to tell you something. Um... The day before Cathy passed, she... She said, "Michael, call Gina kell." What? She was very weak, but she was adamant about it. She wanted me to teach your boys how to play basketball. I-I coach at stoney creek high. That's incredible. That's the kind of woman that she was. It's such a wonderful picture of her in there. Did you take it? Yeah. Yeah, I did. It's, uh, mullet lake. Um, Cathy's parents have a cottage up there. It's from a couple summers ago. It was her favorite place. I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but... It does get easier. You know, I-i sat with her, after she passed, and, uh... I don't know, I-I just wanted to talk to her and-and say goodbye. I did the same thing. But she... she, uh, she wasn't there. You know? You're really blessed to have a lot of friends. Some of them, I've known my whole life. I know you and I just met, but I feel like you're the only person here that I know. The only person that really knows me. Michael? You ready to go? Oh. Uh... Thank you. You know, thanks for, um, for talking to me. Of course. - Can you excuse me? - Sure. It's okay. Sunshine, but cooler, low-70s tomorrow. Wednesday's also sunny, but starting to warm up to mid-70s. And by thursday/friday, we're back to normal temperatures. Next update at the top of the hour. Morning. Morning, Michael. Oh, I moved the cups over so they're closer to the sink. Okay. Charlotte! Jack! Danny! Let's go! Oh, Larry and your dad took them to the park to feed the ducks. They spend far too much time inside. Oh, and I'm taking them for haircuts this afternoon, so don't worry about that. Okay. Careful! The floor is wet. - Thanks. - Uh-huh. See you later. Alright, sweetie. I'll see you later. Bye. Bye, guys. It's okay, sweetie. Hey, Dave. You okay? Christina's been away all weekend. She's visiting her mom. I just have to hang on till after lunch, and she'll be home. What a nightmare. - You're doing great. - Thanks. I'm sorry, man. I shouldn't have said... No. Hey, no. It's okay. It's okay. Hey, Mrs. kell. How are you, Mr. spehn? Oh... hello. Man, I hate that look. People just want to help. Well, that's the problem. There's just too much help. I mean, my mother-in-law's basically... She's... She's taken over my house. She's doing my laundry. She folds my underwear! Well, you have to tell people what you need. Say "I love you, and I appreciate you, "but I'm a grown man. I can fold my own underwear." You make it sound so easy. Nothing about this is easy. Well, someone actually dropped this off at the office for me today... "how to raise a healthy daughter without a father." Uh, you don't have a daughter. - Exactly. - Ah! Hey, Michael. Pastor Karl, hey. I just dropped my kids off. How are you? Yeah. I'm good. Well, I'm here, if you need to talk. Thank you. You know, I'm not much of a church guy, so. Thanks. Wonder what's for dessert. I got juice. Mm-mm. I'm not thirsty. You guys eat what you can, then you can head outside to play, okay? Here you go, dear. Oh, Jill. You didn't... You didn't have to do that. No, no, no. It's no problem. Michael, I think it's time to talk about... What? This is again? You have to... ...Make plans. Yes, you keep saying that. Just listen to him for a minute, Michael. It's been a couple of months now, and as the people who love you most in this world, we have to talk about what's next. Dessert is next. Putting the kids to bed is next. And you want to know what I'm gonna do for the next five years? I'm sorry, but I don't know. Have you thought about our suggestion? Moving to Chicago and buying a house with my sister to raise our kids? It makes a lot of sense! No. I love my sister, but no. I don't know what I'm gonna do next, but I know what I am not going to do... I am not gonna change anything else for those kids. I'm not taking them out of their home! Okay. Okay. We'll figure it out. I'll come by in the morning and get them off to school, and pick them up after, and if you like, Larry and I could move in for a little bit with you. We sure could! No. Thank you. Thank you, but no. We're just trying to fit into our new roles. We don't have new roles. We all have the same roles... Just one of us is missing. Excuse me. Hey! Can I give you a hand? I can't look at this cooler anymore. This thing's like a death flag. Well, can I, uh, call someone to come pick all this stuff up? Thanks. Look, I appreciate all the help, but things are under control here. Are you sure? I've seen you cook. I'll learn. Yeah. Okay, let's do it. Daddy? What's going on? Read it. Okay... "I, daddy spehn, "promise to never, ever... "Forever, "marry again "unless my darling three children, "Charlotte, Jack and Danny agree. "If you, daddy spehn, marry without our approval, "you will have to face us "crying, mad, shouting... And more"? Well! I mean, thank you for putting in the consequences. What made you guys decide to write this? Jaclyn's parents got a divorce and her dad married Mrs. binkow. The lady who lives with 75 cats? It's actually four. Oh, really? I will sign this, but... I'm gonna have my lawyer take a look at it first. Good? Good. Alright, come on. Let's eat. Oh. I forgot my backpack. Yeah. I got it. I got it. I was thinking that we could just get rid of all of this clutter, and line this wall here with benches, so people can sit and talk. I think we should get Starbucks to come in and open up a branch. People could have coffee, browse through magazines. Starbucks in church? You got a better plan? Well, anything is a better plan. I mean, arson is a better plan. Look at this carpet! This is disgusting. I think we start right here and get rid of this. - Ew... - Hey! What's going on? Wh... oh! Hello. Hi. We're just, uh, actually redoing the atrium. We finally have a budget now and a committee, so we just need a plan. I want to make it a coffee lounge. Gina here wants to set it on fire. Ladies. Hey, Michael. Pastor. I hear you've been taking a course over at the college, in, uh, design? Uh, yeah, I mean, it's just something I can take online. Always kind of had an interest, so... That's great. I should probably go. I mean, you're from Chicago, though, right? Yeah. West Side. I'm a southsider. Cubbies fan my whole life. I'm fine. Thank you. Poor Michael. You should call him. And say what? I don't know. Take him for a coffee? It's good to talk to someone who's going through the same things you are. That's why I joined weight watchers. Funny. It's not gonna happen. Ow! Ow-ow-ow-ow! You can't toast the bread. It'll be gross by lunch. By the way, you have one brown sock and one black sock on. Yeah. I know. New style. Mom buys the soft bread and she cuts off the outside. He means the crust. It's fine. It'll taste the same. No, it won't! Yes, it will! Don't be a baby! No, it won't! Okay, no yelling! Oh, Jack, come on. You gotta get dressed. We gotta leave in a few minutes. I don't want to go to school. Okay, look. I don't have time for that today, guys. I've got a meeting in an hour and I can't be late. I have to bring cookies to school today for our party. What? Agh! You should've told me! I did! Three times! Look at the fridge. Okay, okay. Um... Here. There we go. Perfect. Alright, there you go. You're all set. These are crackers! Mommy always baked cookies when it was my turn to bring them. I'm not going! You ruined it! He didn't do it on purpose! Yes, he did! It's ruined! He did it on purpose! I did not! Jack! Go get dressed! Everybody, we're leaving in five minutes. I want mommy! Don't be stupid! She's dead and she's not coming back! Charlotte, don't! I want mommy! I want mommy! - It's okay... - Dad! Do something! - Okay, just... - I want mommy! Danny! Come back! Charlotte! I want mommy! - Shh! Look at me. - No! I want mommy! I know, I know. What do you need? Hey. - What do you... - I want... - Shh. Shh. I know. - ...Mommy! - I know. Shh, shh. - I want mommy. I want mommy. I want mommy. It's okay. It's okay. It's okay. I want mommy. It's okay, it's okay. Hey, Michael! Danny doesn't have a lunch. Ah, no worries! We always have extra for kids who forget. Didn't forget. I just made it wrong. I'm late. I'm sorry. I failed. How so? Cathy, she got sick so fast. The cancer just stole her away from me, and I just... I couldn't stop it. They would just be so much better off if she were here and I... Hey. She would be saying exactly the same thing if she was sitting here and you were gone. I saw a video once of the waves coming ashore during the Tsunami in the Indian ocean. People were just doing regular, ordinary thing.. And this giant wall of water came crashing in, just destroying everything in its path. And there was no stopping it. That's... That's just how I feel. Michael, there was nothing you could do. You couldn't stop what happened to your family, but you can control what you do next. You can gather your kids around you and you can love 'em, and you can guide them out of the darkness. But how do I do that? You stay connected. It's real common for men to hunker down and go it alone, especially when the high tide of grief starts to rise. But if you stay connected to your family and this community, you're gonna find your way. I've got to go. Alright. Michael? Hey! Gina! Hey! Hey. It's good to see you. Yeah! You too. Oh, I can see that you got your mother-in-law to stop doing your laundry. Yes! They finally left. Wait. How'd you know that? Well... Judging by the pink tint to your shirt, you're either doing a walk for the cure later, or you've been mixing whites with reds. Huh. Well, truth is, I'd rather do these things wrong than have a bunch of people hovering over me. Mm. I get it. I got this neighbor and she wanted to bring dinner over for us. I said no, she insisted. So I raced home from basketball practice, you know, with the kids, and there's a pizza sitting on my doorstep. I can order my own pizza. That's true. I know, but why would someone do that? It's insulting. You know what? It's like... It's like she thinks I can't even take care of my own family. I don't think she meant that. I don't know. It's like life just keeps throwing me curve balls. I don't need to hit a home run, just a decent pitch would be appreciated. Then take the walk. I'm sorry, what? Stop swinging at all this junk. Ignore some of these curve balls, and just take the walk. Make it to first base and just see what happens. Nobody takes my metaphor and just throws it back on me. Oh... here we go. Did your kids put this on the list? They said it was the "healthy" kind? Maybe. It's alright. It was a rookie mistake. You're new to the shopping list. Separate your colors. Thanks! "I'd like to get our families together "for dinner and to talk. "I have a few things to give your children... "resources and such. "You can email me or call me anytime. "Good night. Peace. Gina kell." "Thanks for the note. "That would be nice. "I'm sure my kids would love it. Careful about the call-me-anytime stuff. "My "anytimes" these days are well into the wee hours. "I'd love to talk, "but you'd better give me some proper hours to call. Thanks, Michael." "Anytime means anytime. "If you think you're the only one up at 3:00 A.M., you're fooling yourself." "How's Friday night? I'll cook." "I have a virtual food bank. "Everyone pitched in and bought me a freezer. "I have four casseroles, three lasagnas, "some spicy vegan bean dish, "and some unidentifiable chicken dishes that are very good." I'll bring a salad. "Chicken soundgood. I'll bring a salad." I hope I'm doing the right thing. Give me strength. Come on! They're here! Go, go, go, go! Hi! Want to go play upstairs? Sure! Hey! Hey. Wow... How do they do that? Kids, they just know that they belong together. How are they doing? Oh. Uh... Well, they cry a lot, and then we talk about Cathy, and things are better for a little while, and it all just starts again. How are your kids doing? Pretty much the same. Sam's having nightmares, and, some days, drew doesn't want to let me out of his sight, but they're coming along. I thought you were bringing a salad? Oh, I did. I brought a pasta salad, a fruit salad, a potato salad. You know. I got some bread and some things for the kids. I'm Italian! Oh! Okay. Ahh. Mm. Smells really good! Yeah. Oh, thanks. You know what? It's actually pretty good. This woman in church, she, uh... Oh! Oh, the woman with the little tiny dog who has the little outfits? - Yes! - The matching outfits? Yeah, yeah. She's cooked for us, too. Oh, man! She's actually a really good cook. Yeah. Think she makes those outfits herself? Why, I mean, she must, right? Because they're a little bit weird! I think so. Um... Oh! There's this other woman, who leaves us a cake every week, and she's in the choir, but she's got this really weird, awful voice, and they keep giving her solos, and she's just... I know exactly who you're talking about. - It's awkward. - Very. What should I do? Uh... Why don't I cut the bread? Do you have a knife? Yeah. No, no. I'll... I'll... um... - Grab a knife? - That drawer. - I'll... - Okay. ...get into this. Got it? Alright, char, you sit here. Boys, grab a seat wherever you would like. Thanks, pal. Oh... It's okay. So, does anyone know why our families are having dinner together tonight? Well, it's because we're all going through the same thing, and... We thought that it would be good to get together and to support each other, talk and just share our feelings. Excuse me. Would anyone else like to share their feelings? And on that note, okay! Dig in! You don't have to do that. We don't make guests clean up dishes at the house. After the dinner we just went through, we are hardly guests at this point. - Dad! - Yeah? Can we play "ball of peril"? Oh. Uh, it's a spehn family game. Uh... not now, guys. We have guests, okay? Maybe in a bit. No! No, don't let us stop you. Uh... well, but the thing is... Oh, ho, ho! Whoa! If you feel the ball, you must freeze! Run from me! - Ah! - Ooh, ooh! Don't even try to understand. Boys. Yeah! Don't tackle! Oh! Ahh! It just got out of control before I knew what happened. It's actually taken on a life of its own. You need to just think positively and decide that you can overcome this. You'll be stronger in the end for having tried. Oh... Mm-hmm. Well, this is... Uh, was... Charlotte's favorite dress. I'll tell ya, I don't know what I'm doing wrong. I mean, it's not my first rodeo. I did my own laundry in college. Well, yeah, but in college, you probably had jeans and t-shirts and sweatshirts. Now you have a little girl, who has a wool-knit dress that should be hand-washed in cold water and hung to dry. Mm-hmm. Maybe I should just let my mother-in-law keep doing my wash. What? Where is your dignity, man? You can do this! Come on! I'm going to get you started. No, look, I can't ask you to help. No, no. This isn't charity. This is quid PRO quo. Oh, really? What do you mean? Some day... And that day may never come... I may ask you to do a service for me. Until that day, accept this justice as a gift on my daughter's wedding day. The godfather! - Godfather! - Nice! Very good. Bye! Thanks! - Bye! - See you. - Bye! - Thanks for coming, guys. Thanks for having us. Oh! I wanted to give you guys these. It's a book where you can put pictures and... memories. Really, whatever you want. My boys made one for their dad. Cool! Did you know my mom? I met her. She was so pretty. You look just like her. Alright, well, good night. Good night. Thanks. Thanks for the books! You're welcome. Here you go. Thanks. Thank you for tonight. Thank you. It's been a long time since my kids laughed like this. Mm. Yeah. Mine too. Drive safely. Bye, guys! - Take care. - Bye! Bye! See you at school! Well, hey, Charlotte, how are you? I'm good. What's up? Um, I was wondering if you could help me with something. Well, I sure hope so! I think I need a bra, but I don't know what size. I can absolutely help you with that, sweetheart. Come here. Yeah. We can go shopping together, if you want, okay? What are you doing up there? Hey! I'm measuring for the new plans. So you and Colleen have a new plan? Well, mm, yeah, the pastor didn't exactly love our first few suggestions. I'm kind of not surprised. Yeah. The challenge is coming up with, uh, a theme. Well, uh... What about making the space somewhere to celebrate all the people who keep it relevant and alive? Ah! Now, that's a plan. I love it. Me too. Hey, maybe Michael could help us design it. Oh... um, maybe. Sure. Yeah. I'm sure I could pull a few ideas together. Perfect. Hey, listen, thank you so much for helping Charlotte with her, uh, situation. Apparently, there are some things that a man can't do. Yeah. That was my pleasure. Do you remember the quid PRO quo we discussed? I do. "The thing that you may ask may never come." But you don't want me to whack someone, do you? Not gonna be that simple. I mean, it did say "some assembly required." Wow! Uh... yeah. Some assembly and a degree in mechanical engineering. Matt was really good at this kind of thing. Yeah. Well, look. I'm willing to tackle it, but I'm gonna need some assistance. Do you know any strong men willing to work long hours for literally no pay whatsoever? Hmm... oh! Never gonna make it in the union! Let's do this. Alright, have fun! Okay, great. What is this? - It's a bunkbed! - What? Alright, help me out. Alright, now, this is important information. This information may someday save your lives. "Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey." Come on. Say it with me. Righty-tighty, lefty-loosey! Yes, my men! Okay, you guys, tonight, we're gonna start bubba in the one spot, "d" in the two, chopper, you're in the three. Boots, you in the four, and Charlie, you're in the five. Offensively, we are in the 41, I want to see a lot of post-touches and x-cuts. Defensively, we're gonna cougar all day. - Got it? - Yes! Go! Alright, on three! One... two... three! - Whoo! - Go get 'em! Pass! Come on, guys! I'm open! Take a look! Take a look! Come on! He is just so great with the kids. I know, right? Did you know that Matt played basketball for Cathy's dad? Really? Over here! Ho! It's so good for your kids to have a male figure around. We are just friends. Our families just need each other right now. That's all this is. I didn't say anything. Good! Because there's nothing to say. We're gonna be spending the summer in Colorado at my parents' house. Not even gonna see each other for a couple of months. After that, who knows? Shoot! Shoot! Shoot! Oh! So close! It was good for the boys to get away from home and see life from a distance. The outdoors and the quiet time gave me time to find a sense of peace. Come on, guys. I really want to go play hockey. Oh, home, sweet home. I am so exhausted. Are we going shopping? No, definitely not. We'll go tomorrow. We still have a few days before school starts. Hello? Oh, hi, Michael. Yeah, no, we literally just walked through the door. - Yes! - Yes. Please? That sounds great. No, no, we're not tired. Yes! Did you order your kids new school uniforms yet? Was I supposed to do that? Ohh! Charlotte probably grew three inches this summer and Danny's at least one size bigger and Jack's shoes are too small. How could you possibly know that? Ah, it's a mom thing. Cathy knew. Yes, she did. Good morning. Hey! Good morning! Good morning. Ah, gentlemen, good morning. - Hello. - Good morning. Good morning. Good morning, Gina. Ah, the spehns! - Good morning. - Sam! Drew! Wait up! - Hi, pastor. How's things? - Really well. Yourself? - I'm good. Thank you. - Excellent. This is a surprise. It feels good to be back in church today. I guess we're sitting together? I guess so! Go on. Go, go, go. - Let's play volleyball! - Okay. Here you go. Thanks. That's Matt and his three best friends. They grew up together. They put on a golf tournament to raise money for charity in Matt's name last year. They're gonna do it again this year. That's great. This is a video diary that Matt made of himself for the boys, lessons that a father would want to teach his sons. Wow. Have you watched them? I started, but... I just can't really finish it yet. I-I better go see what's going on. Wait. Just give them a minute. I just want them to play fair. Trust me. They play in the backyard, but it's also where they learn to negotiate and compromise. You guys... Don't deny them the opportunity to work it out themselves. Just trust me. The backyard can be a magical place. Who cares? How did you know that? It's a dad thing. I'm sure Matt knew it, too. You're right. He did. Trick-or-treat! Cathy loved Halloween. Matt was too sick to go trick-or-treating last Halloween, so we stayed home and just gave out candy. I can't believe that was 10 months ago. Sometimes, it seems like yesterday, and, sometimes, it seems like forever. You're doing great. And I must say, I really like your costume. Oh! Thank you. The boys dressed me. - Mm-hmm! - I'm a linebacker. Yeah, very convincing. And by convincing, I mean you look absolutely nothing like a linebacker. What're you talking about? I look good! I wore this to target today and I got asked out by a total stranger. Who was it? I'll kill him! Are you jealous? Yes! I go to target all the time, nobody asks me out. If I saw you at target, I'd probably ask you out, too. Are you flirting with a linebacker? Yes. And if you said yes, I would probably take you to an Italian restaurant. Oh, really? Listen, just because you're Italian doesn't mean you're the only one that knows good Italian food. Chuck E. Cheese? Ho-ho-ho! Luigi's. We should go there for dinner. You can judge for yourself. Alright, I'll take you up on that offer. Great! I'll pick you up at 7:30. Alright, come on, guys! Last house! - Wait for me, wait for me. - What just happened? It's not a date. I know. It's just dinner. More of a bet or a dare, really. I totally agree. I mean, it's not about dressing up. It's just I don't have anything that fits. I have not bought new clothes in two years. You should buy something new! I should! But not because it's a date, because it's so not. I couldn't agree more. Or less. I mean, it's important to do something nice for yourself once in a while. This is just good grooming. It's a matter of hygiene. Nothing special. Oh! No. Not my color. I agree. Or is it? Um... hmm. I agree. No. Definitely not. Trying too hard? I don't think so. I like it! No. You're right. Trying way too hard. Too young? Too old? Oh, no. I... You're totally right. That's it. I agree. You know what? It's a nice look for going out for dinner at night with a friend that you really care about. Yeah! This is a date, isn't it? Yes. I am a 36-year-old mom going out on her first date. The first date that I have been on in 15 years. The last time I went out on a date, men were boys. They still are! Just breathe, Gina. Suck in the oxygen... Just let it out. Just breathe. Okay. You're right. This is... Yeah, I think I'm going to faint. Really good. Feels weird to be out without the children. Oh, we could see if they have any in the back they could loan us. Thank you. Hello. My name is Sarah and I'll be your server tonight. Hey, Sarah. How are you? I'm great, thanks. How are you? We are weak from hunger. I mean, I can barely make out the words on the menu. How about some warm bread, then? That would be great, thanks. What? Oh, you were sweet to the waitress. And...? I like that. Oh. Okay. I mean, things like being nice to a waitress gives you points. It's like the right shoes. You know, you wear right shoes, you get points. You wear the wrong shoes could be a deal-breaker. Or-or-or dirt under your fingernails. Or hair. - Hair? - Oh, yeah! Too much of anything is just bad. You know, too much hair gel, too much blow-drying, too much of a comb-over... How am I Doin'? Uh, so far, so good. Oh, whew! Yeah. I mean, we will have to see how you do with the dessert tray. Wait. I have to do dessert, too? - Oh, totally! - Oh! Ordering dessert, even if the woman says no, is key. Now, listen, I'm only telling you this because I trust you're not gonna abuse the information. Great. We're ready to order. We'll take everything on the dessert tray. And then, also... Do you know somewhere that I can get my shoes shined? Because, um, apparently, if they have scuffs on them, this relationship's over. We'll just hear about the specials, please. That was a wonderful Italian restaurant. Thank you. That means a lot, coming from an authentic Italian person. Well... good night. Good night. You should go. I'm leaving. You should. I am. You're going. Good. Okay. Is it gonna be finished in time for Christmas? Well, I hope so. I mean, all the artwork's still at the printers. Yeah, but we have less than two months. I don't think we're gonna make it. Think positively! I positively don't think we're gonna make it. Can Sam and me stay over? Please? Can they? Well, it's "Sam and i." I don't know. I mean, were you guys invited? Dad? Can they? Please? Yeah! Of course. Right? I don't mind. - Yes! Awesome! - Let's go to my room. Looks like we're having a sleepover. Hmm. Yes, it does. Mom? Are you gonna stay, too? Oh, no, sweetie. Adults don't have sleepovers. All alone on a Friday night. What will I do with myself? Oh, yeah, big sacrifice. I might need some ice cream, a movie, a nice long bath... It's gonna be a hardship, but I will survive. Uh, well, I'd invite you to stay... No. I will be back in the morning. You have fun. Well, I'll make pancakes. Okay. That's great. Is this really as easy as it seems? Or... It's impossible. Um... Care to test the waters? What do you mean? Veteran's day is coming up. We have a three-day weekend. We could all go on vacation. The whole crazy bunch of us. You want to travel somewhere with five children? Yeah! Why not? It would be really nice to have a sign. Something to tell us we're headed in the right direction. Mm. Okay, I tell you what. You write a list of all the reasons this can't work, I'll do the same, and tomorrow, we'll exchange lists.

Um... What do you want to call her? I don't know. I already have a mom. She's in heaven. Oh. Um... Come here, Jack. Jack, let me tell you something that your mom taught me. Now, your heart is full of love for your mom, and it always will be. What mom used to say, you know, about growing new hearts? That's real, buddy. You know, and when you meet someone new to love, it's like you grow a whole new heart that just fills with love for that person. You don't take love away from anyone else, like your mom. Okay? That's yours to keep forever. Does that make sense? Good. So really, I mean, it doesn't matter if you call us mom or dad, or Mrs. kell or... Phyllis. We love you, Jack. Good night, buddy. Good night, dad. Good night, Jack. Good night, Phyllis. Good night, Phyllis. Good night. Alright, you guys, come on. Come on, come on. You're gonna be late! Come on. Have a good day, alright? - Bye. - See you, sweetie. Alright, well... I'll call you later. - Okay. - Alright. Bye. Alright. Good morning! Good morning! How was your weekend? Oh, it was fantastic. It was actually great. How was yours? Restful, thank you. Good! - Hey! - Hey. Hi. I brought you coffee. Oh! Thank you. Can we talk? Yeah, sure. What's up? Can we talk outside? I'm dying for a cigarette. You don't smoke. Just trust me. I mean, I don't want to be judgmental... So what's going on? How was the ranch? Oh! It was just great. Really, the kids got along so great. It was just effortless. Wonderful, Gina. I'm so happy for you. Thank you. So what's the matter? Um, people are talking. They think that things are moving too fast, that maybe it's too soon for you and Michael to be quite so connected. Even some of the kids are making comments. Uh... And what do you think? I'm happy for you, but it's only been a year, Gina. I-I just... take it easy with this whole "blue birds of happiness" routine. Your kids need all the support this place can give them right now. I'm... I'm just saying. I really appreciate the heads-up. You're a good friend, Colleen. Ahh! Hey, you guys! Come on, upstairs. You gotta get ready for school! Come on! Go, go, go, go! Thank you so much for doing this. I've just been spread a little thin, and I really needed this. Could I talk to you about something, Michael? Uh, yeah, of course, anything. - See you soon, grandpa! - Thanks for everything. The kids talked to us about Gina kell and her children, about becoming a family. What about it? Do you think it's wise, so soon after losing Cathy? I mean, the kids might need more time. Did the kids say something? Are they upset? No, it's just that... They've had to deal with so much change in their young lives. Do you think they're ready to accept someone taking their mother's place? No! Gina is not taking Cathy's place. She... no one could ever do that. Look, Michael. I know how difficult it is for you to raise three children on your own, and how lonely you must be, but... Gina's vulnerable as well. I mean, she might need more time to get her own life together. We just want you to think about the impact that this could have on all the children if... if it doesn't work out. And what if the kids get attached to Gina, and then they lose her, too? I am so sorry I'm late. No problem. Good to see you. Oh, you too. Between working at the school and we're redoing the atrium, and it's just busy. - It's all good. - Crazy busy! So good to see you. Have a seat. Thanks. Oh, hey! Tell drew and Sam I scored some lions' tickets so we have a date coming up. They will be thrilled. Gentlemen, lady, welcome to the first meeting to discuss the Matt kell memorial golf tournament. I'm happy to say we have our corporate sponsors and we hope to double what we raised last year. - Nice! - Great. That's amazing. Matt would just be so proud of all the work you guys are doing. And since this will be an annual event, we formally need to create a non-profit organization. And the money we raise will go to families, like yours, who were affected by cancer. The four of us will make up the board of trustees. Now, we need to come up with a name. Well... I've actually been thinking about that a lot, and I'd really like to call it the "new day foundation for families in honor of Matt kell and Cathy spehn." I don't get it. Gina, this is Matt's foundation. Yeah, and the golf outing is something that can remain in his name, but I'd really like this foundation to be in both of their names. Right. I, uh... ahem. Yeah, it just doesn't feel right to me. C-Cathy's family went through the same thing that we did. Right, but we're not Cathy's best friends. I mean, Matt was like... He was like our brother. We're doing this for him and his boys. I know you and Michael spehn have been becoming friends, but... Well, it's actually more than that, Marty. No matter. I don't want a foundation named after anyone but Matt. Is everybody done with their homework? Yeah. - The boys are outside, playing. - Oh, good. Alright. Let's just get this chicken out of the oven, 'cause your dad is gonna be home in a second. Alright. You put nuts into the sauce. No one in our family likes that. Oh, but I did it last time, and everyone thought it was great. It's just that's not the way we do it. My mom knew that. Because she was your mom, and she knew everything there possibly was to know about you guys, because she loved you more than anything. It's no big deal. I don't want any. Hey! Something smells good. Yeah. Dinner's ready. I think I'm just gonna, um... Uh, get my boys and go home for an early night. Hey, you guys! Let's go! Is something wrong? No. No, no. Everything's fine. I just, um, you know, I want to give them a bath and get to bed early. Alright. How was the foundation lunch? It was okay. The guys only want to put it in Matt's name. Ah. Tsk. Ah, I'm not... It's not surprising. Yeah. I'm just really disappointed. Alright, you guys. Let's go. Change of plans. Goodbye. Goodbye. - Bye. - Bye. I know how to cook three things. Really? That's great! But, uh, why are you telling me this? We don't need Mrs. kell to cook dinner for us. I can do it. We should wait for Michael and the kids. They already left. They did? Hey, are you sure? 'Cause we were supposed to go buy their Christmas tree with them. Yeah. Their grandma took them home. Oh. Okay, well, let's get you guys home, 'cause we've got to hem your angel costumes, right? Hop in. Hey. Sorry about today. I got so busy and then Cathy's parents came by. I understand. We went to a tree farm and cut down our own tree. It's kind of a family tradition. Well, that sounds like fun. Actually, uh... Cathy's parents want us to come up to mullet lake for Christmas. Really? But I thought that we were... They were thinking it'd be a nice time to get everyone together. They want to scatter Cathy's ashes at the lake. I think Cathy would like that. Of course. Yeah, I understand. You do understand? It's just that... I thought that... You're gonna miss the opening of the atrium a-and the pageant. I know, but it's Cathy's parents, you know. They really want to be around the kids this Christmas. Uh, you know what? I've actually been thinking, um... Maybe we need to take some time and just think about things. For the kids' sake. I agree. You're okay with it? Yeah. I mean, I'm gonna have my parents and sister and Matt's mom and sister around, so I'm gonna have a full house and... I mean, it's not gonna be an easy holiday for any of us. It's only been a year. I'm glad you'll have your family around you. Yeah, and after Christmas, we're probably gonna go up to my folks' place until after new year's, so... So that's it? I guess so. Goodbye, Gina. Goodbye, Michael. Like almost everything good in our lives, this place came to us because of you. You wanted us to come back here, and so we have. And today... We commit your ashes to this lake forever. We will love you always. God bless you, my love. Where are Mr. spehn and the kids? They went to see their grandma and grandpa for Christmas. Well, what about us? Well, we have a lot to do, too. I mean, it's Christmas Eve. You got your grandmas coming over, and tonight we have the Christmas pageant. I'm an angel! Yes, you are. I want Charlotte and Jack and Danny to be angels, too. I do, too, sweetie, but I don't think it's gonna happen this year. Finish up. I love Turkey. Your mom made the best Turkey in the whole family. Oh, she was a wonderful cook. Oh... Mm! I saved all her recipes for you. Dad, I want to go home. We're supposed to be angels and I got a costume and everything. Yeah, I know, pal, I know. You'll be a angel next year, okay? What's he talking about, Michael? Uh, Christmas pageant. How is Santa gonna know we're here? Drew and I were gonna stay up all night. I know. When your mom was a little girl, she used to stay up all night long to see Santa, until she realized he simply won't come until you fall asleep. I'm glad we're here. This is mom's favorite place, so it should be our favorite place. That's true, sweetheart. Mm. She loved it here. We just have be at the church by 6:00 for a short rehearsal. Are you still seeing Michael spehn? Oh. No, we're just friends. It just felt like it was too soon to be involved with a man. Gina... I watched you take care of my son for three years. You were his hope, his support, his love. He would want you and the boys to be happy. Does Michael make you happy? He does. Would you mind if I just took a break? Of course, sweetheart. We'll take care of the boys. Thank you. Lesson number six. Treat women with respect. Cherish and hold dear the woman that you love and never miss an opportunity to tell your mom how much you love her. Oh, Matt. Tell me what to do. Nana? Mm-hmm? I miss mom every day. So do I, sweetheart. I'll never stop missing her and I will never love anyone as much as her. I know, baby. I was only being nice to Mrs. kell because she was nice to me and Jack and Danny, but if you want, I'll never speak to her again. Honey, why would I want that? I heard you tell daddy that if we liked Mrs. kell, it might hurt mom, and that Mrs. kell might leave us, too. You heard us talking and... Oh, sweetheart! I didn't mean that. I... Charlotte, sit down. I want to talk to you. Your mommy would do anything in her power to make you and your brothers and your daddy happy. The next person I want to talk about may or may not even exist. Your mom may want to remarry another man. If she loves and respects someone enough to marry him after I pass away, then I love and respect that guy, too. I know your mom. I know her values. If she remarries, she's going to marry someone I approve of. Treat him with the love and compassion like you would if I were still alive. Thank you. Thank you. I want you and your brothers and your daddy, each one of you, to grow a new heart. Okay? Just like mommy used to say. I will, too. Michael? Michael? Yeah? What's going on? Uh, get the boys. We need to get you home. What do you mean? What about supper? No, no, no. Forget about that. Your kids and Gina's are gonna be angels in church and we have to get them there on time. We'll eat on the road! What? It's 4:00! It's a two-and-half-hour drive. We might not make it. I know, it's crazy, but we're gonna try. Come on! Let's go. Are we there yet? No! Not yet. We have to be there by 7:00. It's okay. We're gonna make it. Okay. That was the exit for the church. We missed it. Where are we going? Just need to stop by the house for a second. Mary and Joseph had nowhere to stay and it was almost time for their baby to be born. The innkeeper in town said that they could take shelter in the barn with the animals. Out in the fields, an angel of the lord... - ...appeared to the Shepherds... - Go ahead! ...who were guarding their flocks by night. The angel announced that the savior had been born in the town of Bethlehem. The Shepherds decided to travel to Bethlehem to see the Christ-child. Suddenly, a great host of angels appeared and began singing praises to god. The angels began to spread the word that the Christ-child was born. ♪ Oh, night divine ♪ ♪ Oh, night divine ♪ - Hey!
