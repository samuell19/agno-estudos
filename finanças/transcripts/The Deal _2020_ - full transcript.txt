THE DEAL Honey... I need your help... Honey. Help me, please. Help me, please. No. Baby! Baby. It's okay. It's okay. Here, I'll take you to a hospital. It's okay. Here. Come on, baby. There. Get in. I'm here, baby. It's okay. It's my fault. It's all my fault. It's okay. Look, it's the police. Don't worry, everything's gonna be okay. Officer! So, you're saying it was a break-in? Yes, right. Can I go with her, please? Sure, after a few more questions. You said they broke in in the afternoon. Yes. No. First, a girl came by. Curly blond hair, she was wearing a jacket, and said that she was in a car accident, and that there was no signal. There was signal at our house, so she came in, ate something, and we waited for her mother to pick her up. Her mother. Yes, at least that's what she said. But one thing led to another-- I'm sorry, what do you mean one thing lead to another? Can I go with my wife now? Yo! The car's documents. Last name? Riscal. Mr. Riscal. Riscal. -Where are you taking her? -Don't worry. She will be okay. She's okay. She's stable. We will keep you informed, but you need to come to the police station. Who? Me? Please. Please. Come with us. 24 HOURS EARLIER No, I want her out. She can't have a say. Okay, anything else? I want to be the majority shareholder. I want full control over the Board. And most importantly, I want her to be forced to attend whenever I call her. I want her to look me in the eye when I have something to say. That's going to be challenging. I don't give a fuck. You're my lawyer and these are my terms. If that's what you want-- Can she decline? Borja, you two spent a decade building the company. She should have considered that before... Fuck it. Borja, listen. Cat is very smart. Since she came to the firm with her father and stayed with us in the office, she never said a word, but I'm sure she perfectly understood every time we talked about mergers and acquisitions. Her father never hid anything from her. On the contrary, he wanted her to be prepared for the future. I know. So while I review these bylaws, you try to work it out calmly. Dammit. Seven years thrown away. We will use that in our lawsuit. Look, if she declines our offer, we will file for divorce. We will allege breach of trust and betrayal of vows, saying that it all occurred behind your back while you worked relentlessly trying to establish the company. There's no way a judge won't find an aggravating factor when the relationship between you is also proven. We will threaten her with damaging her reputation on social media and everywhere else. Will it work? Of course. I'm sure it will. I'm only worried about the eighth clause of the deal. It could backfire in trial, Borja. It's unusual. It's... excessive. We need something big to make sense of your state of mind. So, do you have any proof or something? Sure. Hold on. I will send you some pictures. Don't hang up. They're on their way. Yes, I see them. Oh, shit. You full-on caught her, man. One more thing, thank you for choosing me. No. No, it's nothing. Listen to me... don't lose your head, alright? Don't get swept up by your emotions and end up doing something you might regret for the rest of your life. No, I won't. I will call you when everything is over. Fine. Bye, man. Do you know who she is? Yes. She's my wife. With someone I know. We found these in your house, along with-- -So? -Let me finish. Right. I'm sorry. Did you file for divorce? These pictures made you take action? I sent them to my lawyer for advice. Answer the question. Not without my lawyer. Tell me what happened last night. Well-- Hey there. What's up, man? You're on your way, right? Yeah, I just made a stop. Do you need anything? Not at all. There's plenty of everything. Are you okay? Yes, of course. Why? I don't know. It's your anniversary, right? I have nothing to do with it. You're my best pal, aren't you? I mean... this should be between you two. She's on a trip. On your anniversary? Yes. You know, duty calls. -So, what did you get her? -What? For a present, what did you get her? Honestly, I didn't find anything she would like. But maybe you can help me to find her something. You know her almost as well as I do. Huh? Sure. We will find something. Don't you worry. Okay. One more thing. I'm glad you're coming this weekend. We'll have a good time. I needed a weekend with friends. You know. In the end, it's always only you and me. I'm on my way. Good, drive safely. You're here. Sure, where else would I be? Come here. Oh! You cooked. I did. Smell. Look at this. Tasty, right? It's been a while since you last cooked for me. Can I take a shower before dinner? Of course. Today's your day. It's so good. Delicious. Margaux '59. Weren't we keeping it for a special occasion? We're always keeping things for special occasions. What better occasion than celebrating our marriage? Here. Also, you said you wanted to explore the limits, right? -Me? -Yes. You. To us. To you. Let me taste it. The doorbell. Are you expecting anyone? Could it be flowers or an anniversary gift? What are you doing here? -Weren't you on a trip? -A trip? Marcos, it's nice to see you. What a surprise, come in. Come in. -Honey! -Marcos, you're here! Please, come in. Cat was about to take a shower. Dinner is ready. I opened a wonderful wine. You will like it. Terrific. Help yourself. I'm coming. Can you explain me why you invited Marcos? Well, I told you today I was feeling spontaneous. And you said you liked that. Relax, we will have fun. You'll see. Dear Lord, you're a great cook, bud. Fuck. I think I overate. I'm glad. Bud. Actually, you've always been a great cook. I still don't know what the hell I'm doing here, but-- After this, I won't complain, right? To us, guys. We're glad you're here. Yes. That's true. To my best, best, best, best friend. Seven years later, here we are. The three of us. It seems like it was yesterday, the biggest drinking night ever. And here we are. The three of us. It was a lovely wedding. I almost forgot. There's one more thing. I can't eat anything else. Or I might throw up. Trust me, you will love this. Please, find a way to leave, okay? I don't know what's going on, but this is awkward, so find an excuse to leave. Let's see what the chef prepared. Voil√†! -What's this? -Dessert. This is for you. And this one is yours. Enjoy, pal. Non-disclosure agreement. What is it for? Are you creating a new company or-- This motherfucker is funny. Always thinking of business, huh? I don't understand what the fuck is this. It's something special. To my most special persons. No, it's not that. This has nothing to do with business. This is about us. It is. But it's not. But it is. It's about you. About all of us. And our business. Well, I better get going, or-- -It's too late for that, you moron. -Is it? This is between you two, I'm leaving. This actually concerns you. Stop pretending, I know it all. I've seen your photographs, everything. How can you be so cynical? Are you losing it or what? -Cynical me? -Yes, you. What's this? The divorce papers? No. No, no, it's-- It's a deal, he wants to buy me out. What? Let's call it a practical divorce. As set forth herein, I'll gain control of your shares and the company. And listen, I'm paying you enough money so you can do whatever you want, wherever you want to do it. That way, I can leave you behind, and keep my company. Down here, on Earth, I will do that. A campaign to rename the brand. You will fade out gradually. No complications, no drama, nothing. You two can stop hiding like rats. And I can continue working on the company I built. That we both built. Look, you lost the right to say that the moment you started fucking with my best pal. One thing has nothing to do with the other. You're playing the victim now? I'm the victim here. Understood? And let me tell you this, be smart. Any other man, under these circumstances, wouldn't even give you half the money I'm offering. -Don't play the fucking victim. -Take it easy, okay? -Shut up. -I can't speak? Then what the fuck am I doing here? Huh? Tell me. I want you two to look me in the eye. After all of this, after so long, and so much bullshit and lies, I'm trying to be the bigger man. Okay. I'll get going, or-- Are you leaving her alone? You fucked her all this time, and now you're leaving her? I'm freaking out about all of this too! Was there someone else when all of this happened? Um... yes. Marcos, a friend. Marcos, right. Mr. Riscal, you better cooperate and don't lie to me. Listen, lady. I'm telling the truth. Your house was intact. There were no sings of a break-in. We only found your wife's suitcase. What about Marcos? What do you want me to tell you? -I did wrong. -So wrong. Look... For some reason, at some point in life you forgot about me, you replaced me. Do you realize that much? Maybe you didn't notice, but all the energy that we had, all the energy between us, you poured it all on our company. You and I became nothing but a business. And you forgot about me. You're a man of success. You don't like failure. That's why I never thought this would happen. I thought we could survive this, do you hear me? All of a sudden, those trips started. What first were getaway trips, suddenly became business trips. Longer and longer and longer trips, and we were so fucked up. As fucked up as everybody else. We became the common denominator. All the lies and the betrayal, and that sort of things, and this fucking house where I thought we would finally be alone, just you and me, and get back what we had, but it turned out that I was left all alone. Do you realize? You're good, huh? No. I don't know why but I don't believe you. Oh. Right. Wait. Look at this. No, no, wait. Look. Okay, stop it now. You will sign the papers, right? Is that what you want? Will that really make you happy? I don't know what the fuck is going to make me happy now. But you leave me no choice. Okay. Are you sure? Let's see. I'm really sorry. Forgive me. Well, I don't give a fuck now. Make sure your boyfriend signs the NDA and we'll be done with the negotiation. You can take care of that. You can tell him and say goodbye, because I will keep seeing him. I think you misread this. The deal is invalid if he doesn't sign. So you better go and try to convince him. It won't be that difficult, huh? One more thing. Our lawyer... isn't ours anymore. He's my lawyer. You know for who I'm really sorry? Not me, I'm better than ever. And I don't deserve that you say for that bastard out there. No. For me. I'm sorry for me. For both of us, actually. Because... we lost everything we were. We got lost in this shit. And yes, I got swept up. You're really good. Did you notice just now? Hey, did you read the last clause of the deal? Take a look. Son of a bitch! Hey girl. Got available lots. Do you want me to park it for you? Is that the rate? PUBLIC PARKING For a beautiful woman like you, it's free. Oh, I see. That's cute. Where are you from? It's been a tough day, darling, I'm not in the mood for this bullshit. Hey! Whoa, whoa! You're short-tempered, huh? I see you. Are you from Cuba? I'm from wherever I want. Should I call the cops or what? That accent is turning me on, to be honest. Why don't you just... let me? Let you what? You shitface! How dare you do something like that? You know I trusted you. How much is he paying you? Look, Cat, first you need to calm down. Shut up! You know I can sue you for this, right? You have to understand, I'm only doing my job. You know I'm very patient to fuck someone's life and I can sue you for this? Right now, I'm stuck in the middle of the separation of two persons I'm truly and personally fond of. I need you to understand where I'm standing, that's all. My father thought of you as a friend. I wish he was alive to see you as the snake you are. Here. So, what were you thinking? I mean, what's the logic behind ending up fucking my wife? Did you forget who brought you to Mexico? Who paid for your house? Who gave you everything? How long have we known each other? Is it ten years now? Look at me. Look at me, motherfucker. Do you like her that much? Dear Lord. I've been laughing at you for weeks. Well, these things happen when you try to have an open relationship, right? It's my turn. So, I trust my wife, I have an open relationship, -and then you fuck her? -Will you let me talk or what? Not if you're going to lie. I'm trying to explain it to you, dude. Are you aware that you've been lying to me for years? That's it. Enough. I told you I want to understand you. Marcos, I'm serious. I want to understand what's on your mind to want to fuck my wife. I'm not like you, dude. In life. Look, since I first met you I've seen you get rich, I've seen you succeed, I've seen you buy 20 houses like this. Being with every woman you've desired and fallen in love with them. I don't know what the fuck you mean. I just don't understand. You even have a fucking river, a forest, you got-- You know what's going on. You know what you want. You don't want to be part of my life. You want to live my life. And there's no way, kid. You really pushed yourselves so the three of us would live a lie. But I don't understand. You didn't need anything. I even asked you a million times to be part of my business. But you never wanted. You've never wanted any responsibilities. Responsibilities? What responsibilities do you have? Me? That's my problem. But I don't fuck no one's life with them, let alone the lives of those I love. And listen closely, when you want something you need the balls to grab them tightly and make decisions. Grow a pair, kid. That's how I got all of this. But no, not you... you'd rather stay in the shadows. Back there, in a corner, waiting for the right time to... fuck my wife. That's you, Marcos. And one more thing. I could have expected this from her. But from my best friend? From you? You have no excuses. None. You didn't even have the balls to tell me. Well, you're right. It was never my plan to tell you, or hurt you. But leave her out of this, she doesn't deserve it. You abandoned her. What, you don't remember that either? I only want you to sign those papers and go to hell. -Really? -Yes. Fantastic. We're leaving. The agreement. Thank you. Where the fuck do you think you're going? Do you mind? If you breach your part of the agreement, it will lose validity. And I assure you that in less than 24 hours, those pictures will be delivered to all of the media. You wouldn't dare, Borja. You're nuts if you think we're going to do that. You're pissed? Fine, I get it, you're pissed. But what else do you want? Leave. Borja. Okay, do it. I dare you. But it will be the last thing you do, bastard. You're brave all of a sudden in front of the lady-- Do it. Do it! And I'll send you to prison for five years. If you survive, of course. Stop it. Stop it. Enough! Listen. Keep your end of the deal, or I'll haunt you with all my might. Borja... No, no. Please. -Hi. -Hey. Listen, I need help. I was in an car accident and there's no signal. I have to call my family and tell them that I'm okay. My car won't start and I don't know what's wrong with my phone. There's no signal, and-- I'm sorry, but I'm having a bad day. Welcome to the club. Maybe I can lend you my phone and you can try. Please, come in. Yes, thank you. He won't stop until he gets what he wants. He's being a fucking douchebag. That's what he is doing. And I'm not playing along. There's no other choice. I barely recognize you, Cat. We're in this together, don't forget it. Things turned out this way because of both of us. -You think I don't know? -Shh. I understand that, but I won't play his game. Shut up. Let's go back in. There must be another way. -There's not. -Didn't you read the fucking agreement? Let's go, we'll talk to our lawyers and try to fix all of this. Do you really think that it can be fixed like that? I don't know. But this is the worst place to talk about it. And it's hard to understand how he can be so sick to add that clause. But what if the pictures come to light? -They won't. -What if they do? Yes, mom. Yes, yes. No. I'm fine. Okay. Good. Yes, I'll wait here. What's your address? -65 Camino de la Arboleda. -65 Camino de la Arboleda. The agreement clearly stipulates that if he breaches it, he has to give up everything. And to be honest, I doubt he'd want to lose it all. Let's find a way-- -To what, refute those pictures? -Yeah. He's filing for divorce, and this shit will come out in court. Look. Stop, stop it. You're not alone, okay? What is it? I know that face. We have to do it. Are you serious? You're going to let him humiliate you like that? Yes, yes. Okay. No, don't worry. I'm fine. Really. Yes, I got help. Yeah. Yes. Again, yes. Yeah. I'm okay, seriously. A man helped me. WHERE ARE YOU? I NEED YOUR HELP. Wait, wait, wait. Where's my phone? I think it's in my pants. -Need a hand? -No, no. Don't move. Don't move. Sure? I'm not doing anything. I said, don't... move. It's ringing, it's ringing. Move. Move, please. Cotiti. I'm doing nothing. Count on me. Doing nothing? I'm on my way, don't worry. -Get out. -Whoa! Hey. Sorry, I didn't see you there. I was trying to get signal. But... no luck. It's definitely dead. Oh well! May it rest in peace. You know, today is one of those days when I would've been better off not getting out of bed. I know what you mean. Do you know any spots nearby where I can wait or have a drink? If you want, I can take a look at your car. I know a little about that. I'm not an expert but... -No. No, it's not necessary. -I can help. My mom is coming and I don't want to bother. -It's nothing. Seriously. -No. Don't. Um, sorry. I'm sure you're a busy man. Maybe I should wait outside. It's no big deal. I insist. I need the fresh air. Come on. Alright, I'll do it. But I'm giving up so much too, okay? So, I want to make this very clear. You're above anything else. It's a deal. That's what they're made for. Do you think this will end here? No, of course not. He won't let us live in peace. But if I let him humiliate me this way, I will find a way to defend myself. Otherwise, I'm only going to feel the burden of guilt. Are you sure? What choice do we have? Hm? Whatever, no matter what we do, he won't leave us alone. Yeah. We need to find the way to get rid of him. Weird. It's okay when you start it. But then something goes wrong. What can I do? Nothing. It must be the engine or the belt. Something like that. I don't know anything about this. It's not-- It's not a big deal. Thank you. I didn't do anything. Well, at least you tried. Did you call a tow truck? Not yet. I want to wait until they pick me up. But don't worry. I'll wait here. Thank you for everything. You can wait inside if you like. My mom won't take long. You gave her my address. She will look for you there. And we'll have to come to pick you up. Oh, right. You're absolutely right. I'm a mess. Um, would you tell her I'm waiting here? Or maybe... can I go with you? Yes, of course. Let's go. Borja! -Where could he be? -Catching some fresh air maybe. -This is fucking crazy. -It is. Think it through. Yes. We're going to say that it was in self defense and they will believe us. Desperate situations call for desperate measures. You're confident, right? Who cares? I do. I need to feel that I'm not doing this only for myself. I told you, you're not alone, okay? It's important to know the next steps. And having the same story. The real question is, are you sure? There it is. -Oh, I forgot my stuff. One second. -Sure. Don't worry. Borja is calling. What the fuck do I do? Don't answer. It's getting a little cold, huh? Yes. You're right. You really don't mind that I wait in your house? No. Not at all. Trust me, I would tell you if I did. Lately, I don't hold anything in. That's great. Lately, only few men are like that. Sincere. I'M IN Okay. Once we've done it, we need his fingerprints on the gun. Alright? He found out about us, made you sign the agreement, and I refused to do what he wanted, okay? He tried to kick you out, packed your things, and lost it. Alright? -Then I-- -You? In self defense. Let's see how everything plays out this evening and we will find the right moment. How are we going to do it? Will you dare? Listen, we will do what he wants, okay? We're going to have sex in front of him and do what's in the agreement. Baby, he will go berserk. Okay? I'm going to provoke him, don't worry. Let's go. Okay then... sign. Go on. Sign it. Dear Lord. Fuck it. Let's make clear that we did everything he asked, we even signed the agreement, and yet, things got complicated, okay? Okay, calm down. A glass of wine? -Who's with him? -I don't know. -Um... sure. -Yes? Look who's here, the lovebirds. I called you. I thought you had fled or something. Hi. Nice to meet you. And you are... She's... -Jennifer. -Jennifer. I'm Jennifer. I had a little problem with my car and-- She had a little mishap right outside, on the road. And since we're so welcoming lately and let anyone in... I told her to stay. This is my faithful wife, Cat. Are you okay? Yes. Um... I'm fine. But it's been a crazy day and-- -Borja. -Borja. She still doesn't know. You don't know this, but you're witness of one of the most important evenings of our lives. And we just met. Amazing. Let's go outside while you wait and you make up your mind? What was your name again? -Marcos. -Marcos. It's a pleasure. Um, he tried to help with my car. It's okay, come with me. This way. It feels like I'm interrupting something. No, why? I don't know. It's okay, Jennifer. Borja is a great host. Aren't you? He arranged a wonderful evening. Let's celebrate. For the good times. Just as you wanted. Why the sudden change of heart? Do you want to discuss this in front of our guest? How is your mother going to call you when she arrives? Oh, yes. Right. I'm sorry, I'm exhausted. Um, my phone is dead. Right. Excuse me. So, what happened? This is too much for me. Excuse me, can I use your bathroom? Sure. There's one upstairs. Thank you. Well. This calls a celebration. -Do you feel better now? -No, the usual. But this will be a more entertaining evening now. This is too much for me too, you know. Right. You'll bring her now? I'll bring some glasses. I thought you wanted a toast. Fuck. Hey, kid. Where exactly are you heading? Valle de Bravo. Documents. Alfonso Fernandez Cuevas. I'll be right back. What are you doing? You know that I like to keep things tidy. I want your new friend out of here. Now you're jealous? It's a bit too late for that, don't you think? How do you want us to do it? I don't understand, honey. How, when, and where do you want me to fuck your wife. You've always been imaginative. To you. Go get her, or I will. Relax, okay? Given the circumstances, it's better to let yourself go. We need our plan to succeed. Yeah, relax. We're all grown-ups. Finally you say something logic. You like this? Stop. Not here. Do you really want us to do this? Tonight's going to be a great night. The plate's clean. Everything's okay. Thank you, officer. Can I go now? -Alright. Drive safely. -Thank you. Fuck. What? I must confess I wasn't expecting this. I know you way less than I thought. I was alone for too long, maybe? Come here. Okay, stop. Not here. Are you coming? Come on! Mr. Riscal. Mr. Riscal! Look, my wife was cheating on me with mt best friend, and I-- I don't know why I made that deal. I guess I don't know myself very well, and I wasn't expecting something like that. -Like what? -Like that, it got out of hand. This is the thing, your wife, despite being out of danger now, was admitted to the emergency room, after she was shot on the leg. We haven't talked to her, but we talked to her lawyer, Alfred. And he said that you threatened her with filing for the divorce. She didn't take it well. We also found an agreement where you force her to give up her shares of your company and have intercourse with Mr. Marcos Source witnessed by you. Specifically, on the eighth clause. No... I can't. Not like this. Seriously, Borja? There's a woman in my house and I have no fucking idea of who she is. Can we at least wait until she's gone? What the fuck is wrong with you? What were you thinking? -Shh. Calm down. It's okay. -Are you crazy too? Calm down. Come here. I didn't see you. You were taking too long. I was worried. It's a girls thing. Thank you. This is fucking nuts. Remember when we were stuck in the middle of the desert? I remember how we got there. But I don't know how we managed to get out. You and Jennifer have no idea, but this is a celebration. What are you celebrating? Freedom. Freedom. You're having so much fun. I feel liberated, I can't lie. I'm free. Have you guys known each other for a long time? Well, "known each other"... You ought to be more specific. For many years now. It's been a while, yes. Those are the best friendships, right? You have no idea. Right? Listen. Hey, hey. Marcos! Hey, relax! Cut it out. Listen. Didn't you say there was no signal? I'm just checking. Hope is the last to die. What do you do for a living? I'm a Chief Financial Officer. Chief Financial Officer? Sorry but... you don't look like one. Well, I'm not working right now. Neither am I. They just fired me. But you can't complain. You live well. I mean, not really. All of this belongs to my husband. The fucking eighth clause! Marcos, you've drunk enough. Stop it. Cheers. What's the eighth clause? You don't know what it is? No? I'll explain it to you. I'll explain it to you. Stop it, Marcos, you're too drunk. Fuck, let me explain. Let me explain. Our good friend Borja-- Enough! You're saying too much. What? You don't know what I'm going to say. He is Cat's husband. Well, let's say future ex husband, okay? Oops. He's not sad, or destroyed, hell no! This is a modern man from the 21st century. With big balls, right? He's always... Always seeing the bright side even in the worst of situations, you know. Will you shut up? No, I won't. I'm not saying anything wrong. So let me say what I have to say. Look, I'll give you some context. He can't deal with failure, okay? So he decided to turn his divorce -into a competition. -Stop it, Marcos, please. -You shut up. -Excuse me? Careful how you talk to my wife! I will explain the situation. Listen to me. He made up a deal. A fucking agreement where he snatches everything from his wife. -Marcos! -What? Enough! That's it. -Marcos, please. -No, let me-- So he looked into the shit. That's what he was looking for. Me. -Marcos, stop. -His fucking agreement says that I have to fuck his wife in front of him. How about that! Interesting. Great. Is it true or not, baby? -Is it or is it not? -Stop. Stop it, Marcos! No, I won't stop. You're a coward, dude. You're a fucking coward. Instead of facing it like a man and have the balls-- Motherfucker! -Ah! -Marcos! Son of a bitch. Shit. Where the fuck is it? Where is it? Hey! Hey! Enough! Stop, that's it, I'm not even bleeding, so stop it. Let's call the police, this is assault, -it's in the agreement. -We're not calling anybody. You understand, right? We have a fucking witness. It's over, okay? I'm so fed up with him. I can't deal with this anymore. Are you okay? I don't know. You still love him, huh? Answer me, do you still love him? Do you really want to go on with this? Of course, because this is your fault, do you get it or not? This is all because of you. They have jewels, watches. I'm sure they have cash. Shit. If you do what I say, no one will get hurt. But if you try anything, I'll shoot you, okay? -Wait. -Shut up. From now on, only I will speak. What do you want? Play hide and seek. Where's the safe box? Tell me where's the safe box. Don't move. -Cotiti. -Why are you taking so long, baby? I'm outside the house, I can see it from here. Calm down. Let me know when you're on the front door, okay? -Listen. -Shh. What's that, you got caught? Kind of. But everything's under control Let me know, okay? I'm sorry I hit you. I shouldn't have. Are you okay? Yes, I'm fine, don't worry. It was my fault. Alcohol and I don't get along that well. Where's Cat? She was looking for you. I want you to know that... I didn't want this to happen. Are you going to kill me? Don't try to fool me. I just texted my lawyer telling him that my gun is gone from the safe! I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. Only Cat and I know the code. But Cat is unpredictable. You two are so fucked. If anything happens to me-- Why were you looking for the gun? Are you planning to get rid of me? I don't know. You tell me. Do it! Do it, fucker! If you have the balls! Do it, you coward! Borja. Listen. Show me your hands and don't move or I'll blow her brains. Whoa, whoa! What's going on? If you do exactly what I say, this will be quick and no one is going to get hurt. There's CCTV all over the place, you know that, right? Seriously. Think twice. Thank you, you're so kind. Don't move, okay? You, open the door! Why aren't you moving? Open the fucking door! Okay, okay, calm down. Move, fucker. Move. Don't try anything stupid. You know the consequences. -Move! -I'm on it. Whoa! Easy. Follow my orders. Turn around. Look. You son of a bitch. Easy, okay? Easy. Move. What's up, people? Good evening. Let me introduce myself, I am... your best friend. Or your fucking worst nightmare. It depends on how things go. I'm here to fulfill my necessities. And in order to do that, I need you to listen carefully and do everything I ask. Understood? Understood? Yes. I can't hear you, motherfucker. Yes, understood. Understood. Fuck! Now we're talking. The air feels different. The safe box is downstairs. Good. Tie them. I'll take care of the rest. No, you do it. Go. Do it, baby. Listen, kids, time to play a little game. Put your backs together! Okay. Done. Calm down. Please. They broke into my house and shot my wife. You two argued, your wife wanted to leave but you wouldn't let her, and as it says here in the statement, one thing led to another and you shot her. The gun has your fingerprints and it's under your name. Done. Fuck. We meet many idiots like yourselves. My mom is here. Hands. Don't dare to touch me. -Whoa. -What did you tell him? Shut your fucking mouth or I'll do it for you, bitch. Who's laughing now? Fucking bitch. Whoa! Whoa! Fucker! The fuck are you doing? Give it to me! -Hey! -Next time it won't be her leg. It's okay. It's okay. Turn around! -Ah, shit! -Let me see. -Cotiti! -Fuck them. No, no, no! What the fuck did you do? -Well-- -What do I always tell you? -I told them! -Where's the CCTV? Downstairs. Fuck. Listen, I know what you might be thinking, but it's not true. Listen to me. I was planning to fuck them hard. It's true. But I would never... want to hurt them physically. I'm not a murderer. I'll say it again, your wife was shot with your gun. They took the gun. And set me up. -They? -Yes. They want to fuck me up. Look, when your wife is fully conscious an agent will question her to confirm everything you just said. To be honest, Mr. Riscal, your wife is your best hope to avoid being prosecuted for attempted murder. The CCTV! There's CCTV! It must have been recorder, you can verify there. We did, and nothing was recorded from the last 24 hours. What? I'm assuming that after asking your wife and your best friend to have intercourse, you didn't want any recordings, right? Arrgh! It really hurts. Give me your belt. Cotiti, what the fuck is this? Baby, the belt. Raise your leg. Can someone explain what the fuck is going on? Calm down, okay? We made a deal. One moment. Let's make a deal. One more time. The safe box code is... the date of our wedding, 03/06/13. Okay, what else? The security controls are in the office. -The code is 8436... 19. -36... 19. Great. You need to delete the last 24 hours and turn it off. Okay. I need you to wake him up. Do it. Hi, baby. Bingo. -Motherfucker! Hey! -Cat, Cat, Cat! Fucking bitch. Fucking bitch. The gun was in the safe. Only she and I know the code. There it is. At the back. Okay. We will carry out an investigation to confirm everything you're saying. I want to speak with my wife. In due time, Mr. Riscal. Can I make a call? My advice is, wait for your lawyer and he'll suggest what to do. Do you have a husband? Wife. 3 DAYS LATER Get in. I talked to the police and told them that after dinner, a pair of burglars broke in and pointed at us. They shot me in the leg, and when you tried to protect me, they beat you up, and you fell unconscious. What about Marcos? Where is he? -We need to take you to a hospital. -Don't worry. I'm okay. Listen. Remember when you said that you'd do anything for me? Of course I remember! That has nothing to do with this. We need to call an ambulance. Relax. I'm fine. I'm sorry. You have 24 hours to sign. Read it thoroughly. Take your time. Oh, and your lawyer, our lawyer... is now my lawyer. This is a low blow, my father thought of you as a friend. I wish he was alive to see you as the snake you are. -Hello? This is a surprise. -I need you. Urgently. Where are we going? Home, honey. We're going home. Good morning. -Morning, sir. -I don't want any calls, please. It's been so long. Fantastic. Just a couple details, but everything's okay. Love trumps again, right? That's crazy. Thank you. You don't have to thank me. You don't know what you just avoided. Yes. Yes, I know. That's why I sent you an envelope with the new deal and a copy of the proof of what really happened that night. You don't want the truth to be known, right? She would become a murder suspect. -Hey, that wasn't the deal. -Why, did we sign an agreement? Call me back when you read it. And don't worry, if I fall, you all fall.
