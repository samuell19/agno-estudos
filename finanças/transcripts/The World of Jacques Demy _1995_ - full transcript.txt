THE WORLD OF JACQUES DEMY "Sir, I've put off writing this letter for years. "I wanted to grow up first so it shouldn't seem too childish. "Yet writing now, I know it will still come out that way. "Renoir wrote that the public is grateful to a director "who shows how our front doorstep can lead "to Sleeping Beauty's castle. "Your films taught me so much that I write this to show my gratitude. "They taught me to look at life by placing a magic screen "over the bitter lucidity. "They exhort us to run out to repaint the street with our gaze. "Your films taught me to love life. In them it is both exalted, "and laid bare, both cruel and alluring. "They give us a taste for joy, and the strength to wait, "while being heedful to everything. "'T he thrill is in anticipation' could be the epigraph to 'Lola'" When I told him I was pregnant, he disappeared. The bastard! Maybe not. He was very sweet. I hardly knew him, but he was very sweet. He said, "I'll make a great dancer out of you." Maybe I'm not a great dancer, but I've become a good mother. And sometimes I think he'll come back. I can't believe he really abandoned me. When Jacques gave me " Lola" it was... a marvelous gift. Jacques always wanted me to make a big fuss... "Oh, dear! I'm lost!" ... "Oh, dear! My stocking!" I must be a bit like that. Maybe not now, because I'm older, but I think I'm a bit like that. I don't know... Lola is such a part of me I can't tell which part's her, or which is me. We've grown so close, we mimic each other. I travel a lot, I dance. I have bookings all over. I've only been here 3 days. What time is it? I know it by heart. Hear me? I have to speak up. It's amazing! I feel I'm back in Pommeraye arcade. Jacques loved this scene. It made him laugh. We must get together again. It's been ages. We haven't seen each other since " Lola." Did I get lipstick on you? Not this time. In "Lola" I played Roland Cassard, a boy from Nantes, thanks to Jacques Demy. I never wanted to return to Nantes. In my character, there may have been a little, or a good deal of Jacques himself. Marc looks at Jacques looking through his finder. While I look at Jacques through my Leica. I was visiting the set of "Lola, " a room overlooking the port. Later, he visited me on the set of "Le Boneur. " We were discreet on each other's sets. So I'll be discreet in this documentary. A film by Agn?s, edited with Marie-Jo, about Jacques' films. It's not chronological, it's a casual stroll, with those who knew him, friends, actors and actresses he loved so well. I met Jacques at the Tours Short Film Festival. In 1959, he moved in here with me, in this house and courtyard. We raised 2 children here, Rosalie and Mathieu, with lots of cats like Brumaire, and Zgougou here. Even if we both worked, wrote and did casting here, and cut our films in our editing room, we never worked together. Creative work is... a very personal matter. We keep out of each other's way. In '58, he had me read "Lola. " It was originally entitled "A Ticket for Johannesburg. " I made " Lola" thanks to Godard. Jean-Luc was the first to find a fellow named De Beauregard. He was extremely pleasant, he didn't have a dime, but figured, " Young directors are a good bet, and they're a bit wild." He was part of that race of adventurers. So Jacques' project was a big musical comedy. It'd have cost 250 million francs, in color and Scope, with dancing and singing and costumes... So De Beauregard said to me: "Look, it's a sweet project, "but 'Breathless' cost 32 million. If you can do yours for 35, "it's a deal. If not, count me out." The songs were out, costumes were out, the dances were out. So Jacques thought, "OK, I'll play the game." He played the game, in black and white, with five characters and a skeleton crew, Bernard Evein, myself. We did everything. It wasrt much. I shot for 5 weeks, without sets, costumes, or lights, but we had film stock, a camera and actors. He filmed without sound so he said to me, "Look, I couldn't afford a sound crew." So at the screening Jacques recited all the lines, both men and women... I was dazzled and delighted. I was mad about the film, it was magnificent... and musical, in a way... Full of music in its very silence. It's me, It's Lola I laugh without reason, say Love is always in season I know how to please, no unease I get compliments from elderly gents Bravos from brave boys, Hurrahs and Come with Me's I laugh it all off, I'm just out to please It's me, It's Lola There's also a little Lola named C?cile whom a Yank sailor takes to the fair. Annie Dupeyroux recalls... I was so in love with him, he promised to marry me when I was 18. I kept waiting for him. I really was 14 that day. The day we shot the birthday scene was my real birthday. I was given the dress as a gift after the shooting. Unfortunately, my grandmother made a cushion out of it. A TEEN'S TALE I was 13 when I saw a scene on TV. In it was a little girl who looked like me... Anyway, I identified with her. And she was with an American at a fair. I was living in St-Germain-en-Laye, where there were Americans and fairs that were off-limits to me. Anyway, I wasrt allowed to go. So I completely identified with C?cile, and C?cile was Lola. And this image has been virtually emblematic of my life. Jacques loved this biannual fair on the Cours Saint Pierre in Nantes. He wanted to shoot his last script there, "Bumper-Car Kobi. " He'd already thought of Nantes before for a film about a homecoming celebrity, Michel Can'tier. When he offered the part to Yves Montand it became Montand's return to Marseilles after 20 years in "Three Seats for the 26th. " Do you still have family or friends in town? Yes, but we've lost touch. You must have memories. Memories galore, Pleasant memories, especially, and not-so-pleasant ones like everyone. I try to fight the belief that musicals can't make it in France. There've been counterexamples, like " West Side Story." Plenty of Stanley Donen musicals have done well in France and were superb. We haven't made many in France, but when we've tried as in " Let's Go to Deauville" or " Let's Go to Monte Carlo" ... I don't know if you remember, but they were charming, done with a sense of lightness and charm that created a dreamy atmosphere. A film is a long, complex affair, this one even more so. I first brought up the idea with Montand in Los Angeles in 1968 I wrote it in '72 and talked to him about it. In '75, Michel Legrand said okay. It had taken us 20 years to make it. Cinema is an act of great patience. THE WORLD OF JACQUES DEMY "Sir, I've put off writing this letter for years. "I wanted to grow up first so it shouldn't seem too childish.

I first brought up the idea with Montand in Los Angeles in 1968 I wrote it in '72 and talked to him about it. In '75, Michel Legrand said okay. It had taken us 20 years to make it. Cinema is an act of great patience. This kind of film involves considerable effort: Rehearsing the dances, getting an American choreographer, doing the sets... We recreated Marseilles with the transporter bridge. A musical is expensive to make. Luckily, there are people who are ready to take a chance on you. And a sympathetic nut turned up: Claude Berri. "Lola" really gave me a jolt. I saw it four times. I'd always wanted to do a film with him, especially in later years, because he had trouble working and I could finally do a film with him after my success with " Jean de Florette." He really had guts. I think he truly loved movies. He produced the film alone. He stuck his neck out. That's good. And Montand went along with it all very graciously. I think he loved the film. I think so, too, understandably so. What's great is, it's the first film where he sings and dances. That's true. And it took this long. It's incredible when you think of it. Let's do a run-through first. Movies that dance, movies that sing Movies that are simply enchanting Movies that smile, movies that beguile Movies in which you can stay a while Movies that bite, movies with might Blood and guts for those who like a fight I don't find 'em indispensable But what I really like is a musical! It's also about a young girl who wants to break into show biz and who asks Montand for three seats. That's the film. Look, I need three seats for the 26th. I'll pay for them, naturally. We'll see what we can do. Sit down. She's a knock-out. Mathilda May, that's who she is. She's terrific. I'd also like to talk about Fran?oise Fabian, an amazing actress. She's truly lovely and attractive in a really appealing role. She has an incredible way of phrasing her lines. And the character she plays is wonderful. The guy has it all, doesn't he? Who does? Montand. Don't you think? Mind turning it off? "Myl?ne" is a very specific type in Jacques' films. There's always the woman from the past, waiting for a lost love, a love she's let slip away because she was too proud or because she lied to him. It's the Darrieux character with Monsieur Dame in " The Demoiselles of Rochefort." It's Lola waiting for Michel. It's a bit like Chekhov's characters who miss out on life. That's what really touches me in Demy's films... that sensibility, that nostalgia. Something about you moves me deeply. And there's something familiar, too. This is like a riddle. What is it? I don't know. It's as if I've always known you. And there's the incest. I love you, child, and I want to marry you. Poetry misleads you, Father. I beg you to stop. - Do you love me? - Yes, Father, very much. "Very much" is not good enough. May I retire? I feel suddenly weary, and filled with bad thoughts. Bad or good, I intend to marry you, child. DONKEY SKIN Ask a little girl who she wants to marry and she'll say " Daddy" if she's 5 or 6 and loves her father. When you read the tale at an early age you're not aware of it. My dear child, a parent is not someone you marry That you love your father is natural on the contrary, Whatever your reasons, whatever your feelings for papa... My dear child, nor does one marry one's mama Traditionally, we saw That questions of culture and law dictated in their time one can't marry a daughter to her papa. Once, long ago, when I was a child, 7 or 8, I was especially taken with "Donkey Skin. " I tried making the film from the viewpoint of when I was 7 or 8. From now on, your name is Donkey Skin. - Is it far? - We're nearly there, Milord. "Donkey Skin" is a fantasy film, designed to give not an illusion but an impression of what Jacques imagined about that fairy tale. Jacques had rounded up a dream cast: Jean Marais as the king, Catherine Deneuve as his favorite princess, the jolly neighbor queen, Micheline Presle, her playing-card king, Fernand Ledoux, their charming son, Jacques Perrin, an eccentric fairy, Delphine Seyrig, and an enthusiastic extra, Rosalie. She was 12 and already interested in old costumes. Some 3 or 4 years after "Demoiselles of Rochefort, " Jacques called me to play the Prince Charming this time. But why me? This masculine ideal... An imaginary person who's part of the collective imagination as well as Jacques'. For the procession of this festive film we had the Three Wise Men, nobles in sedan chairs, nabobs on elephants with their guards, fairies in helicopters, and visiting friends, like Jim Morisson and Alain Ronay. Jim gladly signed an autograph for Delphine's son. He was a movie buff like Fran?ois Truffaut. Both loved princesses. Playing a princess in a musical film, in a fairy tale... Children still gape at me wide-eyed, it's really amazing. It's a film that people and children simply adore. It's the film of Jacques' that's traveled the most. If I were a billionaire, I'd stop working. But if I were a billionaire, I'd still do this film. I wanted to recreate things that Marais did with Cocteau. I know Jacques Demy put one or two things in the film, as an homage to Jean Cocteau, whom he loved and admired. There are 2 or 3 references like that in the film, the caryatid, for example. Jacques Demy is so human. He's both serious and childlike. There's such purity in his gaze, in his heart too, of course. It comes out in the way he works. For the throne, Jacques and Jim L?on dreamed up a giant cat, and they made a great white cat on which Jean Marais sits. A dress the color of time? Is that a condition? A whim, rather. Then would you marry me? Yes, Father. I'll be damned! And there were those unbelievably heavy dresses, like the time-colored dress which was to change colors. Jacques had it made out of the material they use for movie screens, so it could be projected upon. Magnificent! I've never had anything like it. THREE TECHNICIANS Jacques wanted a rose with an eye and a mouth. So I photographed Annie's eye and her mouth. I was script girl on the picture, my fourth with Jacques. Jacques thought I had irregular eyes. He asked me to lend him my left eye, the one without the mark, to give to the rose, and my mouth, to talk to the Prince. I was amazed to see he kept my voice. I thought that my southern accent would detract from the fairy tale mood. Are you bored, Milord? Never, Rose. Not in a world where there is so much to discover and understand. I'd done so many musicals with Jacques... Hearing the music non-stop, day after day, getting into the rhythm during rehearsals, you get to know it all by heart. We were shooting in playback. The music was turned on before rehearsals and takes. So the entire shoot was shaped by the rhythm of the music. And in the editing room, we used the same playback over the images, and then again during the mix. We were all immersed in an amazing musical bath. When I'm alone in my car or I'm caught in a traffic jam, I start humming the tunes from the films. When I drink, I say: "Oh! My cheeks are on fire!" As a child, I baked a cake using Donkey Skirs song. But the recipe works better in the song than the kitchen. People always mention Donkey Skirs recipe. True, the princess is always busy with her recipe where the chick pops out of the egg. One bowl of... I admit I'm just like the audience. The charwoman with her broom is someone I never pay attention to. They're fleeting images. It's not what stays in mind. Yet it's essential as a counterpoint: Every time we see the princess, she glows more! Mrs. Chiron is nice, but no imagination! Come on, Lucas, wash your hands and set the table. Did she find you in shape? Good shape, good morale, everything. It began as a joke, and because Deneuve and Mastroianni wanted to do a comedy together. When I was pregnant with Mathieu I was so happy I kept talking about it. And Jacques said: " You really overdo it!" It began as a joke with Agn?s. She said to me: "If you men could get pregnant "you'd behave differently with us, "us gentlewomen." So I said: " Just you wait. I'll show you." But all I could really do is make a film about it. THE GREATEST EVENT SINCE MAN WALKED ON THE MOON What is it? You're white! Could you pull over? Your blinkers, bimbo! Look who's talking, bonehead! Marco! Marco, darling. Tell me the truth. Just some dizzy spells... It's nothing. Marco, I want to know! The anxiety is killing me, please! Look at me! It's serious, isn't it? I'm pregnant... For once, Jacques had fun by doing something totally different, almost hyper-realistic. I played a hairdresser in angora sweaters. I'd love my man to get pregnant. I can't have kids. It would be a change. - A change from what? - Dunno... Everything! If men start having kids, the pill would sell like hot cakes. And they'd abort. Imagine a captain of industry on maternity leave. Never! He'd abort. And not go to jail! It's a fantasy, of course, but always rooted in realistic details. You need more practice. You're not ready for a road test. You haven't improved enough. Tomorrow at 5 p.m.? Okay? Yes, Mr. Mazetti. Crying won't help. No, Mr. Mazetti. Goodbye. See you tomorrow. The axle on the van... broken! - Damn! - You said it! The film contains many feminist notes. There's much talk of motors and curls. In fact, both mechanics and hairdressing nursed Jacquot's youth. At his father's garage, his mother pumped gas and did people's hair before and after his birth on June 5, 1931, in Pontchateau, not far from his grandmother Rosalie's bistro. Then he lived in Nantes, on Tannery Quay, when there were still canals. He had a kid brother, and, much later, a sister. I had no harsh memories until I was 12, until the war. There was the bombing of Nantes on Sept. 7, 1943. It was a ghastly experience. And when you have memories like that, and I have a very vivid memory, that's when nothing matters anymore. After something as horrible as that, you get the feeling nothing worse can ever happen. And that's when you start creating a fantasy world. Early on, Jacquot fell for puppets and operettas. I related it in "Jacquot of Nantes. " All I needed were 2 or 3 potatoes to carve marionnettes out of, and movies twice a week, and I was happy. Movies were my only love. I began to dip films in hot water when I was 9. Chaplin movies. I was fed up. They were 5mm prints. I'd seen them 150 times. I'd dip 3 or 4 of the reels in hot water to soften the emulsion and draw on it frame by frame with a pen. It was very crude, but I did the bombing of Mauves Bridge, and I recreated the bombings of Nantes. That was in 1941-42. I felt I'd accomplished a heroic act of resistance and courage. I bought my first camera when I was 13. I went to vocational school, by day. It was my father's idea. I studied carpentry, boiler-making, electricity and mechanics, none of which did me any good in life. Thursday afternoons, I'd rush up to the attic and I'd do a shot or a second of a shot. I wanted to get away, I wanted to make movies. POMMERAYE ARCADE The cine-club was here. This is where Jacques saw all the films that marked him. The office was right there. He always said it was thanks to Bernard Lerat, who introduced the films, and myself, the club co-founders, that he learned to love films and got to study them, and how they got made. In those days, we programmed Dreyer, Bresson, Renoir, Ophuls, Welles, Visconti... Everyone who mattered for him, as he later said, and all the American musicals that dazzled him right off. I did so much daydreaming here in my teen years. It was on my way home from the movies. I learned Mandiargues had written something about it. I'd walk across in this filmy light... And I know I could shoot 10 more films in Nantes. I'm taking this train to Nantes, which for me remains Demy's city and the town in " A Room in Town." For this little trip to a friend and to memories, I've brought some documents, like Michel Colombier's score. When Jacques came to see me, he told me about this film, which is first a tragedy, meaning there's a passion, and there's violence. Of course, this violence involves the social conflicts in Nantes at that time. I'd never been asked to do anything like it before, where love and violence were so involved. I can't play the violent passages, because it takes more than a piano. So I'll just play the love theme between the two. If I ended up at your mother's it was by pure chance So you're a real country boy Yes. Gilbaud, my love - Shadows under your eyes... - Edith... You're so handsome! - So lovely! - I feel so good... I want to say I love you Fran?ois, stay with me By your side But I can't... Listen... It's getting light. - Please! - I have to go. Don't go, my love... When will I see you again? Tonight, if you like. The story is set in Nantes during the shipyard strikes of 1955. It's a tale of passion. Fran?ois Guilbaud, a striker, leaves the gentle Violette for Edith Leroyer. Edith leaves her husband and hides at her mother's. But everything conspires against the lovers to destroy this budding romance. There's the clash of two worlds. The first clash is raw, first degree, a kind of original clash. It's called class struggle. Police, pigs! Scum, swine! It was in 1955 during the shipyard strikes and " A Room in Town" relates it. I remember being with my mother pushing my brother's carriage through the demonstration. People were moving in the direction of the prefecture. I followed... Those songs... really left... a deep impression on me. I had an uncle in a factory, another uncle in the Loire shipyards. My father worked in another factory. It's all part of my childhood. So it meant a lot to me. I like to deal with what I know. It's based on a story my father told me, his story: A peasant arrives in Nantes, rents a room from the wife of a colonel, who was an aristocrat. The scene between the aristocrat and her working-class lodger is a key scene. It largely sums up the film. I saw you demonstrating, don't deny it! So, does it bother you? It bothers me... I mean, the neighbors are talking. Let them talk. You understand, my late husband, the Colonel, wouldn't have tolerated it. Besides, I don't like boarding an anarchist My opinions are none of your business Jacques asked me to do this film a while back. The project was ready and then it fell through. It happens with movies. Then, this year, he called me again: "The film's on. Still willing?" I said: " Am I? I'd be thrilled." Camera! Playback! In this case, the sound's already done. You play with the soundtrack. You can't do a 2nd take differently. No. There's no second chance. You may think it's an obstacle, but it isn't . It adds something. Music is very stimulating. It's everyday language, but when the Colonel's widow sings: "In the Colonel's day, I only smoked army issue..." or when Guilbaud retorts: "You're smashed!" Or when she says: "You really take me for an ass!" We've entered a world of total incongruity. It's funny. You really take me for an ass! What about passion, and obsession? That's a laugh! Since the role is sung, set to music, because the movements follow the rhythm of the music, I think that it takes the performance farther. You let yourself go farther, faster and more spontaneously. It carries you. It's just love that you send out in a certain manner, a way of communicating that I find more interesting if it's sung. It can be more tender, more generous, more violent, more aggressive, more gentle, whatever... That's what interests me. Music amplifies feelings. When you sing: " I love you" that's pure lyricism. I think Jacques' language is this popular opera he always dreamed of doing. It's a language, my language. Excuse me. I'm sorry. Listen, I swear to you... What kind of way is that to dress? Is that how you go out? Your fault! I haven't a thing to wear! That's no excuse. So you go whoring. The strikers must get a kick out of seeing you. Edith's revolt is to do what's not done in her milieu, and not when you've just married. She's a part-time whore. With Demy, a whore is a demi-whore. I remember spending long weeks stark naked under a mink coat which I could open only once. It was rather frustrating. So in the scene, I opened it once, and then I opened it again. That was my act of rebellion. - My husband, alias Edmond... - They're running away? ...salesman, redhead, madman, madly in love, jealous... - Madly in love with you. - ...impotent. When he asked me to play it like a lunatic, while pretending to sing with a razor in my hand, and you nude, I was in my element! Edith, you are mine. Please, don't! You belong to me. You'll never forget me now. By acting the part, I think I helped Jacques enjoy playing out his wildest fantasies. He was my first great director. I suddenly entered Demy's world... "Demoiselles" and " Umbrellas" ... It was like a miracle. Jacques was very kind and attentive, he listened, he was very nice. But, at the same time, totally uncompromising. No negotiating, no discussions about costumes or hairdos, not about acting, the timing of a scene, or any ideas you might have. If I said: " I'd like to pick up my cup just then," forget it! His childhood dream was coming true! We felt crude compared to the purity he sought. He was always pleasant but inflexible. Like a sword. I was the chief of the workers, the heroes. We couldn't chicken out... Don't come closer! No protests! Back! Disperse! Police, pigs! Scum, swine! There were 1,000 of us playing the workers, facing off 100 riot police. But the extras playing them identified so strongly with their roles they got terribly violent. A few bashed us with their shields and cut open Stevenirs forehead. Seeing how things were getting out of hand, Jacques stopped the scene. He took 200 extras from among the workers and put them with the riot police, then switched 200 extras from police to workers. Everyone feared they'd take revenge. It's a tragedy. The film's heroes meet a tragic end. But it's like the tragic fate of Romeo and Juliet, Tristan and Iseult. It was written that way. They were doomed. For instance, in " The Umbrellas," Genevi?ve says: "I could never live without you, if you went away." But she marries another man and settles down. Fine. Here she says: "I could never live without you." And she doesn't . She kills herself. That's unusual. If you look at Jacques' films, it's the only time a woman dies of love. The characters in my film are eaten up with passion. In Nantes, people have a kind of passion like that. It's a city full of vitality and life. Paradoxically, he had to leave at 18 because the movie capital was Paris. He moved to Paris. He had made film school thanks to his can'toon and thanks to Christian-Jaques who pulled strings since he had no diploma. In those harsh, jobless years, he lived in a maid's room on the 8th floor, sharing water and the john on the landing with Bernard Evein and Jacqueline Moreau, down the hall. We met in Nantes at art school. He took night classes, I studied afternoons and nights. We met up in Paris. He was at ETPC and I was at IDHEC. He spent two years there and finished his graduate film, which he wrote, acted in, directed and edited. The future Jacques had come a long way. He also painted a self-portrait in the same mood. I wanted to meet Paul Grimault and work with him on animation films. Paul gave him his first job, and one of his last, in 1986, helping direct "La Table tournante. " My first job was for a commercial for Lustucru noodles. I did it in my room. It was my first paycheck in movies thanks to Paul. Thanks to a script girl he knew, Jacques worked as an extra on "The Rebels of Lomanach. " They fitted me out in a wig and costume, and I had a lot of fun dying in every shot. Look at the film, and you'll see a guy always dying in the foreground. Always the same guy: Me. He became assistant to J. Fran?ois and J. Masson, and to Georges Rouquier on "Noronia, " where he met Jean Marais. He suggested a documentary on his boyhood clogmaker. Rouquier said: "Do it yourself, I'll help you produce it. " I was lucky to see these people in their lifetime and to be able to record their existence without modifying their habits, their outlook on life, their way of thinking... I'm a bus driver now, but I once learned the clogmaking trade, and I knew Papa L?on, who took Jacques in during the war. He was the inspiration for " The Clogmaker of the Loire." I myself played the clogmaker in the film " Jacquot of Nantes." One day, I saw a film by Jacques Demy on TV, "The Clogmaker, " and it really got to me. My name is Didier Baron, city gardener. I wanted to pay homage to Jacques Demy, by making a man out of flowers. You see it here a bit damaged due to the dry summer. He's mounted on a flowerbed composed of 2,000 red begonias and a few white begonias around the edge. I'm the principal. Teill? is tiny, we have only 46 pupils, but the parents chose " Jacques Demy" for the school's name. Jacques Demy had been here during the war. We are inaugurating Jacques Demy Street in memory of a great filmmaker, who was also a schoolboy in Mauves-sur-Loire. In '58, Jacques made a film about Jean-Marie Vianney, the parish priest of Ars. It was a commission. I think he agreed to do it a bit in memory of " Diary of a Country Priest," which he loved, both as Bernanos' novel and Bressors film, which was a great example for him. We were amazed by this church and this shrine, with its wax figure that bordered on the grotesque. I thought: The subject is interesting. Why not try to understand it? But I never did understand. He admired Cocteau and asked him for permission to film "Le Bel Indiff?rent. " He asked his friend and now collaborator, Bernard Evein, to design a lush red set. Once he began directing films, including " Le Bel Indiff?rent," I did his sets. I worked on 80% of his films. After my parents, Evein is the person I've known the longest. I think he's tremendously gifted. You hide behind your newspaper, but I can sense your cruel, watchful face. Yes, my dear: Watchful! And I shall speak, I shall get it off my chest. And nothing will stop me! He'd cast Jeanne Allard, partly for her resemblance to Maria Casar?s in "Les Dames du Bois de Boulogne. " We'd recite lines from " Les Dames," entire sections of Cocteau's dialogue, such as, " Agn?s, when you dance, you are another person, "like a chandelier alight..." Jacques and I took turns quoting Cocteau dialogue. My deepest influence was Bresson. He really changed my life. He revealed basic things to me about a new kind of filmmaking. Ophuls, too. Why? They've nothing in common. One worked with gravity, the other with a light touch... but both equally serious. After the war I saw my first American musicals, which gave me the desire to do film musicals. He wanted an opera, he got one. It was entirely sung. He wanted it to be clear, self-evident, he wanted it as a kind of song throughout the film, a single throughline from start to finish. Have you told your mother? -Not yet -Why not? You're cowardly Don't be cross with me I know what she will say What? "My little girl, you've lost your mind. Marriage at your age?" You've lost your mind. Marriage at 16? - At 17! - And in love! Am I ugly or stupid? You're not stupid but you're no beauty queen Jacques suggested " Umbrellas" to several producers. The funniest reaction was De Beauregard's . "Sure, it's a nice story, but it'd be better without color, "cheaper in black and white, and without music. "Why not do it with ordinary dialogue?" Of course, Jacques refused. Thank heavens he met Mag Bodard, who loved the idea. A film entirely sung, remote from all the conventions of a trade which tends to recycle what's been done before. That's what I liked about it. And I liked Jacques. I felt this was the start of a grand adventure. When we recorded the voices, the actors and the singers were together. They worked together. The actors would say: "I'd say it a bit like this or like that. "Here, I'd speed up, there I'd hesitate..." And that brought everyone together. The aim was to get as close as possible to spoken dialogue. I followed Christiane's score. She was a marvelous singer. She recorded before the shooting. I followed everything she did. We will have children And I'll call my daughter Fran?oise -And if it's a boy? -A girl it shall be We were all girls in the family I'm just kidding. Actually, I know all the other roles, too. The mother's , Genevi?ve's , Roland Cassard's , every part in the movie. Meeting Jacques when I was so young was a formative event. It was the mold that shaped me. It meant a lot. Very few directors played that role in my acting career. He was the first real filmmaker that I met. They worked well together. When Michel found a nice melody he'd call us down to hear it. He'd say: "Now here comes the third hanky. " They really wanted to make the audience cry. This morning, I received my call-up order So I'll be away two years or so. We'll discuss the marriage another time With things as they are in Algeria now I won't be back for a while, you know Audiences wept, it was so sad. We'd planned it... ...since Jacques and I wrote on the score: "First hanky, page 38... " "2nd hanky... " So we had a score with... and a scoreful of hankies. Jacques: " Too many!" Me: " No. You'll see." My love! I love you, love you, love you "Umbrellas" was my pet project. It's really a story of love and war. Things that move me, like separation and fidelity. It's also a film form that fascinated me. My parents were in the Communist Party then, politically active, and they told me: "You have to see it. The first honest movie "on the Algerian War." Or, more exactly, the war's effects. It's a tragedy, a melodrama. Why? Because Deneuve, Genevi?ve, hasn't the patience to wait. She didn't forget. When she goes back to Cherbourg, he hasn't forgotten. Neither has she, or she'd never have come back. Something like that. It's by Michel Legrand. "Umbrellas" was my first Demy film. I was 8. I felt like singing all day long. I bought an umbrella and my life changed completely that day. I just loved "The Umbrellas of Cherbourg" and it's terrific... It's the most beautiful movie I ever saw, really! It's an explosion of colors, sounds... "Umbrellas" was big hit, and not only in its Paris release... At Cannes, it won the Palme d'Or. We didn't know what hit us. Jacques rented his tuxedo. I had a black gown and borrowed jewels. We played the game. But we couldn't get over it. Yes, it did open doors all over the world. I went to Tokyo and... It was very pleasant, in Moscow, everywhere. "Umbrellas" was even nominated for an Oscar. Jacques began to seriously dream about Hollywood, but kept cool. He'd tell me: "If Hollywood calls, say I'm not in, I'm busy." One day, we're at our mill with the kids, and the phone rings. It's Hollywood. I call Jacques, " It's Hollywood!" He laughs, " I can't be disturbed." I say, " It's for real. Quick!" I wanted to live in the U.S., to see what it was like. Everything excited me. He had a fine contract at Columbia. He was so proud. He came up with a sequel to "Lola, " 8 years later. Lola in L.A. He rushed out and rented a white convertible and drove around L.A. He'd call me, " It's a dream come true!" I came over with Rosalie and our little dog. We rented a small house with a pool and a second convertible for me. I'd drive around and at night, we'd say, " A dream come true!" I was really happy for two years, because it was a special life. We'd spend Sundays with Gerry, Harry and their families. We'd listen to the Doors, Mamas and Papas, Jefferson Airplane, and Buffalo Springfield. Jacques had me do some silent screen tests. Jacques looked forward to directing young Harrison. They scouted locations together. They visited the model shops, naive forerunners of the sex-shop. 25 years later, Harrison Ford, now a star, still remembers the adventure. Jacques fought hard for Ford. Gerry did, too. Finally, the studio cast Gary Lockwood, who'd just done "2001: A Space Odyssey, " to play Lola's lover. If you've seen " Lola," it's better, it's like running into someone you haven't seen in a long time. Lola in Nantes was cheerful, always on the move, never stopping. But when we did " Lola" in L.A., she became very nostalgic, even sad. Something had snapped in Lola. As in "Umbrellas, " the romance ends when he goes to war. This time it was Vietnam. It was unpopular. Demonstrations broke out all over America. Did Harrison Ford dress in khaki in memory of a role he never got? We both had a good laugh, thinking, had he done it, it would surely have changed the film's career. I called it " Model Flop," which it was. Though they're having second thoughts in the U.S. These days. But it was still a fine movie. H?L?NE DEMY, JACQUES' SISTER I was on the set. It was nice seeing Jacques in Hollywood. He'd managed to make his first film in English, after attending many sessions at Berlitz and an immersion course in London. Jacques loved to learn. When the " Anouchka" project came up he studied Russian, at 45, by himself, until the project fell through. He also learned color photo processing. He blew up his photos in Cibachromes, did tests, thoroughly enjoying it. His favorite themes: The wide open spaces, roadsigns, and his family. Our mama, known as Milou... our brother, Yvon... and me... Agn?s, and the children, Rosalie... and especially Mathieu, with his many faces. He had him skate through a little film about France and its marvels. At 50, he took up painting like a beginner in drawing class at the Poussin Academy. At the Louvre, he'd copy details from Poussin. Oh, yes! And he learned to fly, like Michel Legrand. He studied mathematics again, and read "Aviation 2. " He'd take us up for a ride. He impressed me. And I impressed him since I was an English teacher. I still am. He had such a hard time learning American English. But it came in handy, since he made other films in English, like " The Pied Piper of Hamelin." It was one of my favorite fairy tales. The rats were trained in England and shipped to Germany. They had to arrive 40 days earlier in customs for a 40-day quarantine period before being sent to Rothenburg to play in the film. BIOGRAPHER He made a very gloomy, very harsh film about the plague-infested Middle Ages. And then, passing through all that with enchanted grace are these strolling players. They come to the town and leave it uninfected, because they have grace on their side. And there's the clash of social classes, the bourgeoisie, the Army, the Church. What struck me in " The Pied Piper" was the lyrical shots, the camera movements, the harmony of the staging with the sets and costumes. It's as if Demy, who didn't always have the means of his ambitions, had what he needed there. He took a childrers tale he'd cherished, and made a very dark, very harsh film. I had two collaborators, Andrew Birkin and Mark Peploe, who did real research into the Middle Ages. How the plague was treated... How such and such a character would behave... There's the Jewish physician who fights the plague. And no one believes in him. The plague is thought to be God-sent, and not a natural phenomenon, transmitted by rats. In the 14th century, the Jews were being persecuted. The Piper took the rats away, but he was not paid. So he led the children off. Jacques Demy is the Pied Piper. He can lead you from the city into a dream, or away from difficulties. He takes you, not saying where, so as not to scare you. If I were a child, I'd want Jacques Demy as my father. Picasso said, "It takes a long time to become young." Jacques is a child who grew up not forgetting his childhood. Next Friday, we'll study Lesson 19: The Seven Capital Sins. For this sketch film, Jacques chose what he considered the most amusing sin. What's " luxure" mean? It means luxury. And it's a capital sin? - Obviously. - How come? Because " luxury" means money. If I have money, I say, " I've got capital." So it's a capital sin. And in Hell? They wear moth-eaten furs and fake jewels. It must really be hell. I got the idea going down into a parking lot late one night after a show. I had this feeling of anxiety. It was a rather sinister place and I had a ticket. For the Beyond, I felt. - The Styx? - Exactly. It's a love story, first of all, a fable. A fairy tale where there's no fairy. It's Orpheus and Eurydice, based on the myth. In the film, she's a junkie who dies of an overdose, as often happens in show biz. It's not a musical, but rather a fantasy. But since the hero, Orpheus, is a singer, obviously there are songs. Why me? This is Mr. Orpheus, a very talented pop singer. Married, no children. Rumor has it that you're known and admired. I think so, yes. Does that make you happy? I love to sing. Singing is to spread joy. The public gives me joy in return. I had the Beatles in mind, John Lennon, Yoko Ono... I can't say why, but mixing up civilizations also seemed an interesting idea. Eurydice! Where are you? Can you hear me? I'm calling you! The reviews were terrible. When the film opened I was slaughtered, viciously! That's the movies! You try something... It's like the lottery. You win or you lose. You never know. We were at the Cannes Festival in '62 for my " Cleo" and we went to the Casino. Jacques had never seen a roulette table. He was fascinated. He left the Casino, saying, "I bet on 17 and won big, but it was risky. I'll make a film about it." BAY OF ANGELS I wanted to lay bare the workings of a passion, which could just as well be alcohol or drugs, too. It wasrt the gambling per se. The gambling passion devours everything. There's not even any desire. She's caught, drawn in... There's no appetite when she says, "Great! I'm gambling!" No, it's that expectation of something mysterious. It's like a rite, a ritual. "Bay of Angels" is my favorite Demy film. They keep gambling, they have an extreme penchant for risks, for putting all the chips on red, though the ball might land on black. It's always fascinated me. I also like the way the film was shot in black and white, very soberly directed, whereas Jacques is known for an utterly different style of film: Colorful, full of songs, cheerful, and... rather innocent. That innocence hides lots of unexpressed things. "Bay of Angels" is a real film about decadence. I've always been afraid of sinking into debauchery. A puritanical streak, obviously. So even if I embody sin, if she embodies sin for him, she's unaware of it. It keeps me going. Why deprive myself? In the name of what principles? I'm free. Jacques insisted on strict fidelity to the written dialogue. He'd even say, " Faster! Faster!" He wanted that flow of words without any punctuation, and then suddenly, a full stop and a pause! In his very choice of locations, in his choice of costumes, Jacques directed my every move. He saw the character of Jackie as a peroxide blond, a little like Carole Lombard. He made some choices with Cardin, the choice of only whites and blacks, and I remember wearing a boa. And when Jacques was choosing the costumes, he said, "The wasp-waister!" I knew " Lola" had worn one. Mine was white. And I thought, "Well, if it makes him happy..." You bought fruit! Oh, the lovely peaches! I bought olives, apricots and grapes. You're an angel! I was 21, fresh out of Dullirs school, and for me the possibility of doing a film with Jeanne Moreau was simply extraordinary! And yet... I found it normal. I found everything normal in those days. You're terrific! You really think of everything! It's funny when you think that Jacques went from the "Bay of Angels" to the bay of Los Angeles. Mr. Yamamoto thought of Jacques Demy, whose "Umbrellas of Cherbourg" had made such an impression on him as a child. They contacted me on March 1, 1978, saying, "The film will open on March 1, 1979 in Tokyo, "and throughout Japan, in 150 theaters." "Fine, Sir! How do we proceed?" I worked it all out. I was really excited! I found it thoroughly surrealistic, totally interesting. So I said yes. Count Jarjayes already has five daughters. When a 6th daughter is born, he angrily names her Oscar. Raised as a boy, she/he becomes guard to Marie-Antoinette. Catriana McColl played Lady Oscar. He didn't want someone androgynous. Certain actresses could have played the role. He tried to find the character with blue eyes, blond hair and ringlets of the Japanese comic strip. The "Carmagnole" is not a common sight in the streets of Senlis. Jacques Demy has staged highlights of the French Revolution in this provincial French town. The time is 1789. The Bastille has just been taken. For love of a commoner, she defies the authority of the King and even her own father, finally to openly become a woman again. Strangely, the film was released almost everywhere in Asia, with great success, but hardly anywhere in Europe. And not at all in France. Then you had a TV experience... Television? Yes, " La Naissance du jour." That was a commission, too. I like it because I thought it was unfilmable. But it wasrt , and he filmed it. It was my first experience in costume designing. I began as a trainee on " Lady Oscar" with Jacqueline Moreau, who'd worked on a number of his films. He gave me my first chance. Dani?le Delorme, who had played Gigi, became Colette. Jacques got permission to shoot in Colette's real house in St-Tropez. It was a joy to work with him, choosing certain artists as references, composing moments in which the colors were essential. For the film, we looked at Van Dongen. We dreamed, we imagined, we were teammates. The image of Colette was familiar because Agn?s often wrote in bed. My taste for costumes dates back to when Jacques brought me my first Barbie doll with wardrobe. She looked like Marilyn to me. Now I see her more like Catherine in " Demoiselles." I was allowed in the dressing room of the world's two loveliest Barbie dolls. It was like a dream. The two sisters were radiant. They'd spent hours making up. Fran?oise powdered her body. I found that so extravagant! It's funny seeing these images again: Jacques was so precise, demanding. Catherine was so delightful with me, so considerate. Between takes, she was always ready to have fun. Gene Kelly also had fun dancing in the streets of Rochefort for this French-style musical. For the film, Jacques turned Colbert Square into a fairground. The people of Rochefort were both extras and bystanders. It was like a showcase. A sailor passes through... The fair arrives and turns the city on its head. Shall we set up here? "From town to townlFrom Loire to RhinelThe road is our home..." Here, we can put a little... Can we add boys to the chorus who sing... And then everyone in unison again... This is how I see it... Let's go through the melody once... Yes, once, to check its length... We wanted to do a real musical, in the American style, something cheerful, where people are beautiful, the girls gorgeous, the boys full of life... That's what Jacques and I wanted. Our first idea with Jacques was to do a very colorful film... I had Dufy paintings in mind. -What have you done there? -Nothing, just a tear! Why the can'tons? Our costumes, gowns fit for a queen Quick! Let me see! So simple, they'll suit us to a T - Nifty! - Naughty! I'm hungry! We're going, just a minute more Wort we look a bit like a whore? Funny, the thought never occurred to me I think " The Demoiselles" is his most popular film. So many little girls still behave like either demoiselle. For my 10th birthday, I asked for the soundtrack album. I kept playing it, I knew it by heart. I sang it to everyone. It was magic. Just like a fairy tale. For me too. It was my excuse for talking too fast. When my teachers complained, I'd say, I'll never talk as fast as the Rochefort sisters. Or me sing as well. The film is like a star, each point referring to themes in other Demy films. Like the sailor theme... -Sailors are more fun... -...Than carnies. Sailors make lousy husbands But as lovers they're quite decent As sailor, friend, lover or husband, Sailors are always absent I wanted to visit the port of Nantes. You always meet sailors there. There used to be a transporter bridge, which Demy missed. So he had it painted on glass for "A Room in Town. " There was a similar bridge in Marseilles, which reappears in "Three Seats for the 26th. " Maybe he chose Rochefort for his "demoiselles" because of the transporter bridge nearby. The opening credit sequence was shot there. But I haven't seen Delphine in three days! I told you, we work! And next week, we're off to Paris. I'll join the orchestra, and Delphine the Opera. We won't rot here. Girls always say they want new horizons. What they really want is to escape the shadow of a beautiful mother. That goes for Myl?ne in " Three Seats" or Mrs. Desnoyers, or the mother in " Umbrellas." Widowed, jilted, broke, but still beautiful. They attend to their looks. There are not only women in Demy's world. There are men, too, and very fine men, like " Monsieur Dame." He's so touching in his music shop. It's an unusual story for a very ordinary man like me. My fianc?e found my name a joke. It shocked her, and in a stroke, She left me one night without a word, without a sign. I haven't laid eyes on her in 10 years' time. Monsieur Dame's romanticism is a trait of these secret characters, these " provincials," who hold on to the passions, hopes and wild desires that we hide. My favorite is Maxence, a romantic in search of his feminine ideal. He's a painter, a sailor, and so blond. Braque, Picasso, Klee, Miro, Matisse... That's life! Okay, that's life! But what about you? Don't tell me you paint in the barracks! You can't paint in a barrack, it's just not done! I have a room in town, a studio. Every night, I go AWOL, go home and paint. And he's humorous. -Where to? -I've got a train to catch I'm on leave in Nantes, perma-Nantes leave! That didn't make you laugh a bit That's bargain-basement wit Demy's women are always restless, exuberant, eccentric, and they never wear watches. They always ask the time. And now it's time to finish reading the letter you started earlier. "You are a truly original filmmaker. "Only you can mix a harmonious cocktail of varying predilections "for painting, music, poetry, "caf?s, philosophy, fairy tales, "social critique, opera, American musicals, "exotic and spiritual travels. "You give expression to a world both true and reinvented. "I get high on your films. Excuse my tipsiness. "I only wanted to say: Thank you. Camille." I'm Caroline. When Demy died, I said, " Damn! Now I have to grow up!" But no, because with his films we reclaim our childhood. I'm Marine. The Sunday I learned of his death, I'd just listened to the song from " Cleo from 5 to 7," which goes, " If you come too late, I'll be laid to earth..." Today, I can't listen to that song. I wrote this in the summer of 1990, I'd thought about it all summer. I mailed it in the fall, I know it was too late. After his death, I wrote an open letter for the " Cahiers du Cin?ma." I felt I had to tell others about the world of Jacques Demy, whom, sadly, I never got to meet. THE WORLD OF JACQUES DEMY
