A beer. I'm sick of this. - I mean it, Johannes. I'm sick of it. - Think I'm not? Nice one, Johannes. Thanks. Could've been worse. The headlights survived. - I think we can push it off. - I need to talk to you two. It's been a while since your mom died. I'd like a woman in my life again. Just go to the pub with Johannes, Dad. Let's do it. Lone, they're lacking whole fish in the filet department. - Dad. - Good morning. Hi there. Pussy straight from the tropics. - Hi, Sandra. - Hi, Ulrik. Come on. He won't bite. - Hello. - Hi, Rosita. My name is Ulrik. Well, he doesn't speak English, so say your sentence. My name is Rosita. I'm happy to meet you. Thank you for inviting me to Denmark. - She's been practicing. - No, thank you. Thank you for coming. - I made coffee, so let's... - We can't stay after all. - Frank's mom is in hospital again. - Another stroke. Left side this time. - Just one cup. - No, you have a good time with Rosita. We'll leave you two alone. Bye, Rosita. You know what to do. Bye, Ulrik. This is the kitchen. This is the living room. This is the bathroom. Johannes lives in here. My youngest son, Johannes. This is the bedroom. Come and say hello. This is my youngest son, Johannes. Johannes, this is Rosita. - Where are you going? - Out. - Hi. - Hi there. How come you're in such a good mood? My dad is installing a woman at home. - A Filipino. - Oh. I don't know... He can't even talk with her. - He may have other things in mind. - Very funny, Maja. Well, we're the funny couple, right? What would you like? To get the hell out of here. You could move in with me. Give your dad and his new girlfriend some privacy. In your one-roomer? I'd tear your head off within a week. It was just a thought. - Fish. - Fish. Fish. Hi, Dad. - You didn't come home for dinner? - I had a date with Maja. You couldn't have called? Can I come in? If you behave. Would yi like a cup of coffee? Would yi like a cup of coffee? Would you like a cup of coffee. You. Yes, please. I take sugar. I don't take milk. Hey, Johannes? - Hi, Jens. - I hear your Dad got a Thai wife? Is she hot? She's from the Philippines. I don't know yet if I'll get to stay. I must get a job before I can buy it for you. I miss you. You're learning Danish fast and you'll get even better, when... Having fun with stepmom? Sussi kicked you out? No, I'm just storing some crap in the shed before the baby comes. Right... It tastes good. She wants to ask you something. She wants to know if she can get a job at the factory. At the factory? We can't hire her. She's here on a tourist visa. We have to get married, before she can work. I make more than enough. I just want you to have a good time, Rosita. Okay, I have a question for you. You don't have to answer right away. - What if we found something together? - Something what? What do you think? Asshole. I think we... we've got a good thing going. - Don't you think? - Sure. This is too small for us but we could find another place. A real apartment. Maybe somewhere else. In another town. But everyone we know lives here. - What? - No, you're right. It's just me. - What? - No, that was silly. What's this? There's so much. - It smells like the basement. - No, I washed it twice. You're just sensitive. - This is perfect for this climate. - I really like the color. - I'm glad my husband can't see me now. - He dresses like that himself. - At least he doesn't smell of tobacco. - No, but he's fat. So tell us... Is it big or is it okay? I haven't seen it yet. Are you saying you haven't had sex yet? Maybe he misses his old wife. Look, Rosita. Ulrik didn't just send for you to cook him hot meals. Do something so he won't feel unmanly and send you home. Always put some of this margarine on the bread. And then sausage and jelly. And there you have a packed lunch. Put some sausage and some jelly on it and make a packed lunch. Don't speak English. She must learn the language. How about you learn another language, Dad? Filipinos are fast. They're used to getting ahead in the world. If you've got a problem, do it your own way. Fine with me! Okay. Sure. - You're just going to stand there? - I live here. - It's my house, my kitchen. - So make your own lunch. - Bye. - See you. - Boy, am I glad to see you, Johannes. - Hi. - Take over, will you? - Are you drunk? - Go get Rosita. - What? - She's at Joy's birthday party. - You do it. - No fucking way. He's your dad. - Good luck with that, Johannes. Oh, come on, Dad! Come here. Dad, go get your girlfriend. Dad, come on. Dad, come on! - Party with us. - I'm not going to party... - Sure. Come and dance. - No way. Yes, dance. Dance, dance. Fine, let's dance. Thanks. - I'd better go. - Bye. Sit up. Rosita? Hi. Hi. Johannes. - What? - I need your help with something. I want to thank you for coming and for everything you do in the house. I think you're a really wonderful woman. I'm sure we're going to make it and get along just fine. - That we'll get along just fine. - That's what I said. - So, how about a toast? - Sure. - For me and for you. - Thanks. Cheers, Rosita. I smell like a fish factory. I'm going to wash my hands. There you go, and let's turn. Well done. Hi. - I bought her a bike that fits her. - I can see that. - I'm riding my bike. - She's so fast. Great. I need to sit on the floor. I'm glad she and her butt aren't living with us. - I'm just looking. - Not at my ass. Although it's hard to overlook. Christian moved in with his girlfriend. He can't sell his apartment. - Christian who? - Christian Kirk. She's your stepmom. You're sick! Rosita baked the rolls. I'll move that. - What's the occasion? - We're a family. We meet and eat rolls. I see you every day, Dad. It's more than enough. Sure. - He might sublet it. - What? - Christian Kirk. - Okay. Dig in. - Eat up before you take the next roll. - I wasn't raised properly, okay? Great rolls, Rosita. Rosita. - Time for a break? - In a moment. How are things at home? Fine, thanks. Rosita's kind and absolutely fantastic. Okay. How are she and Johannes getting along? Fine. We're all doing fine, Allan. Good. Then everything's fine with the three of you. I'm going outside. Hi. Hi. We're playing ball, are we? Come on, Rosita. - Nothing happening? - Try again. - It's dead? - Yes. You drive it too hard. - Oh, Maja's joining us for dinner. - She is? She's your girlfriend. - Hi, Maja. Welcome. - I'm happy to be here. Oh, I met Sussi and Allan the other day. - She's getting big. - Yes. She looks like a hippo. I want to look like a hippo someday. I want four kids. Two of each. Good luck with that. - Are you going to the pub later? - I'm not in the mood. - It's Friday. - I said I'm not in the mood, Maja. And you've got yourself a job? What? Who got a job? Rosita got a job. She cleans the boat and makes 80 an hour, no tax. - So who organized that? - Who do you think? - You didn't think to confer with me? - Why? Because you own her? Dad, she needs to send money home. That's why she's here. Here you are, Rosita. That's not why she's here. Rosita is part of our family. If she needs something, I'll see to it. - Would you like some more, Maja? - Yes, please. Thanks. I need to go to the bathroom. I think I'll sleep at my own place. So are you two men having a good time at home with the little hottie? Do both of you dip your roll in the soy sauce? Shut the fuck up! Fuck you! You handle stuff like that at the pub, not on a fishing boat! No one wants to take a hotheaded idiot out to sea. We weren't at sea. We were in dock. You were aboard the boat in dock, and you beat up the captain's son. Yes or no? You're lucky your dad can get you a job at the factory. - No way am I working at the factory. - So you'd rather be a hairdresser? Why so sad? Hey, what's wrong? I've grown too close to his son. I have feelings for him, and he has feelings for me. I don't know what to do. Are you going to place your future in the hands of a young man? In a couple of weeks he'll tire of you. The old ones don't leave. They're grateful and thank you for cooking for them. A fairy tale with a boy and then a ticket back to Manila? Back to your mother with empty pockets? Think with your head, not with your heart. Your head, Rosita. Your head. Stop. No more. - Is anyone there? - No. No! What's going on? Shit! Come here. Let's find an apartment. Let's buy something. A little house we can fix up. - Are you serious? - Yeah. Work with your left hand and spray with your right. Joy will show you how. Finish off by mopping the floor. - Joy, show Johannes the ropes. - Hi. - Hi. - Wash everything down. No worries, Johannes. It's only for the rest of your life. - Johannes, how did it go today? - Fine. - What are you doing? - I'm packing. Well, I can see that. I'm moving in with Maja. We're going to buy our own place. You're going to need my room soon anyway. What do you mean? What do you mean? Your girlfriend's got something back in the Philippines she forgot to mention. You're going to be a stepdad. Have you got a child? Yes. How old is your child? Eight years. Godofredo. He lives on my mother. He lives with your mother? I want him here. Well, I sure don't know how I feel about that. She's too young for you anyway. I'm sorry, but she is. Find someone your own age. A mature woman who isn't just after your money. Tell her thanks for now, give her some money and take her to the airport. And let's put all this crap behind us. Dad? Dad? I want to marry you, and of course we'll send for your son. Your son should live here with us. Can Godofredo come? Yes. We're going to be a family. We'll start over. We'll start afresh. Fish? Rosita. I want to have a bunch of children with you. I want to do so many things with you. But I want to be able to go to my father-in-law's house without being afraid that my boyfriend will be shooting glances or... dreaming exotic dreams. I may have big boobs, but I'm not stupid. You're wonderful, Maja. You're really wonderful. I do want all those things, but I can't. I can't. Hi, Maja. So you aren't coming in? No, I think I'll pass. I need to head out. There's not much left for me to do here. I miss your mother. Subtitles: Helle Schou Kristiansen
