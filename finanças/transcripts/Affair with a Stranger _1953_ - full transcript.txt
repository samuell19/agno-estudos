KNOCK AT DOOR Mind if I sit down? Not at all. I wanted to thank you for the part. I'm terribly grateful. You deserve it. I just hope I don't let you down. You'll be all right. I owe you so much. Do you realise I've been in all your plays? Let's forget the first one. You're never around much after a show opens. You never have time to pay attention to me. Pay attention? You're playing the lead, aren't you? Seriously, don't you ever see an actress offstage? Of course. Then how do I look? Very attractive, very appealing and very nice. I don't mean to take you away from your work, but I did want you to know how I feel. Why didn't you tell Anna not to quit? You said you'd meet me here! I know. I promised to be in Philadelphia when you arrived. I bought my ticket... It's the third time! I'm not sick, I'm as healthy as a horse, Lyn. But I want your reaction before the show goes to New York. Why does a man have to tell his wife why he needs her? All right, I'll see you at home, if I come home. Oh, hello! Hello. I didn't know you were on this floor. Right down the hall. Where are you headed for? I was just going to scare up somebody to have dinner with. What about me? I'd love to. I have to go by the theatre. I'll give you a buzz. Sure. Hurry back.

Oh, you're in his new play? Well, dear, you ought to know. WEATHERMAN: '..heavy rain in our area. 'In New York City, this rain will continue throughout the night...' Thank you so much. You were divine to call me. Bye, darling. June, get the Blakeleys. PHONE RINGS Hello? I'd like to speak to Mr Blakeley. He's in Philadelphia. Is Mrs Blakeley home? Yeah, but she can't speak cos she's in the tub. Miss Lawson, you're on in two minutes! Wouldn't she...? Never mind. June, get some stills of the Blakeleys from the file. And call the newspaper office. Don't forget. I'll never make it. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. In today's papers, Marion Randolph, New York socialite, is to marry. We announced it over two months ago, when it was vehemently denied. And now for the big news - Broadway will be amazed at the news that William Blakeley, playwright and director, and his wife, Carolyn Parker, are on the verge of a divorce... That's enough. I was sure she was going to say Blakeley was dead. I'm going to his new play. He'll be a dead pigeon if he loses that gal. You know him? We've been friends for years. Know his wife, too. Had a hand in his meeting her. It was New Year's Eve - was it '48 or '49? All I know is, it was a clear, cold night. Times Square was jammed. I used to run the out-of-town newspaper stand. It was just before midnight... BAND PLAYS: "For He's A Jolly Good Fellow" Howdy, Pop! Hello, Bill, Happy New Year! Happy New Year. Bill, I got a hunch that next year, you're gonna do terrific. You had the same hunch last year. It's just one of them breaks. Things are bad then there's a change. Then there's a change to the worse. Pay me later. Thanks. Say, I was just thinking, you know any Broadway producers? Only my landlady, and she's getting tired of the acquaintanceship. You've heard of George W Craig, the producer, haven't you? Who hasn't? He got his paper from me before he moved to 5th Avenue. Great guy. I think maybe I can get him to do something for you, see? You mean, to read my play? He used to ask me to look out for new talent. Yeah? HUBBUB FROM CROWD Good evening, Pop. Evening, Ma'am. Happy New Year! Same to you, Ma'am. What's everybody looking up for? They're waiting for the ball. At midnight, that ball comes down, and then it's New Year. Really? This is my first New Year in New York. Is it? Happy New Year. Happy New Year. Who is that? I don't know. But she gets the Toledo paper every night. Toledo? Happy New Year. Hello! What are you doing in New York? I think you've made a mistake. Ah, the old home town paper - Toledo. It's good to see you. You don't remember me, do you? I certainly don't. I remember you. Your name slips my mind. Yours slips mine, too. I'm Bill Blakeley. Don't tell me... I'm not going to. BAND PLAYS "Auld Lang Syne" Happy New Year! Happy New Year! You ought to be put in jail. I'm gonna get a policeman. That's a good idea. Let's find one. The noise has died down, hasn't it? Yeah. What time is it? Oh, it's about one o'clock or so. Look, Miss Parker... Carolyn. Look, Carolyn, there's something I want to say to you - I'm sorry that I... No, I'm not sorry. What I mean is, will you forgive me? I guess so. But don't you ever... Yes, I forgive you. This is where I live. Good night. Good night. Carolyn, may I see you again? Maybe. Give me a ring. Oh, er, Carolyn... You may as well know I've never been in Toledo in my life. Neither have I. But the newspaper? It's for the lady across the road. She's from Toledo. Good night. Oh, my name's in the telephone book. Did you show Blakeley's play to Craig? Look, I never knew Craig. It was New Year's Eve and Blakeley was broke... Say, I've got to run or I'll miss my show. IN A WHISPER: Hey, you forgot your change! RADIO: 'Miss Lawson's column appears in 600 newspapers...' Turn that thing off! '..heard by 20 million people.' Darling, is there any truth in the report of the Blakeleys' divorce? Why would she say it, Mrs Stanton? These people tell just enough truth to confuse everybody. See you. Yes. You know the Blakeleys? They used to live here on the second floor! First, she was alone, then after they were married... For the first six months here, she was as lonesome as a dog in a pound. Then one night he came to call. She wanted everything just so. She was fussin' around that apartment like a mother hen... SHE HUMS Oh! CRASHING AND RATTLING Oh, good heavens! Are you hurt? No, I'm all right. What happened? Oh, look at the rug! Oh, Ma, look! DOOR BUZZER That's him. Who's him? My first date in New York, and look! Just let him keep on buzzing. I'll go and get a rug to cover it up. BUZZ That window looks terrible. Never mind. You go and let him in. BUZZING Hello. Good evening. Oh! What is it? A-hum... What's the matter? Excuse us. What's wrong? Why, your dress, at the back. Oh! Oh! Hurry up and get changed. Send him away. Don't be silly! Here. Here's a pretty dress. Put this on. How am I going to face him? Facing him wasn't the mistake. I'll let him in. Now hurry up! Won't you come in? Thank you. I'm sorry we kept you. That's all right. Won't you take a seat, make yourself at home? Thanks. Um, Miss Parker will be out in just a minute. Excuse me. I'm sorry. I couldn't be more embarrassed. For slamming the door in my face? That and... Don't worry. There is one thing I'd like to know. Yes? What was it all about? Was there anything wrong? Didn't you see? See what? What are you talking about? Oh, nothing. Nothing was wrong at all. Nice place. Neat, clean... Thank you. And very feminine. May I look around? All you have to do is turn around. Kitchen! Spic-and-span. Chicken! Did you cook it yourself? Mm-hmm. Would you like some? If you insist. Got to find out if you're a good cook. Certainly is feminine. Um, won't you sit down? Mmm. I'll take it. No. You stay where you are. Yep, this certainly is a feminine place all right. You keep saying that. I know. I mean it. I get the feeling I'm the first man that's been here. Indeed? It's so, um... So feminine. Mm-hmm. Say, you sound angry. Did I say something wrong? I don't pretend to be a siren, but I'm no hermit either. Now wait... There was a young man here last night... You've got me all wrong. It was a compliment. To say a girl never had a man interested in her? Is it a compliment to say that...? DOOR SLAMS Oh, dear. Why... BUZZER Good evening. Hello. Well, nice apartment. A little too feminine, don't you think? What sort of a guy is he? Who? The fellow who was here last night. Oh, he's just an old friend. When will I read your play? What's his name? Timmy. You said you'd bring it. Timmy who? Just Timmy. Tell me about the play. Timmy who? What kind of a looking guy was he? Now listen... OK, OK, I'm shut. KNOCK AT DOOR Oh, Miss Carolyn, they've just called me in tonight. I was wondering if you'd take care of the kid. Well, I... I didn't know you had company. Mrs Wallace, Mr Blakeley. Hello. It would be fun to take care of the kid. I don't want to impose. Now, you be a good boy, Timmy. Timmy! Hello, Timmy. Hi. Timmy. Say, Timmy, what you got here? The night after, she came down and had a good cry. She was sure he wasn't coming back. Soon he was popping in and out all the time! Oh, gosh! Oh, excuse me, folks! Happy! Oh! Oh! Oh, baby, does it hurt much? No. No, it feels delicious. I'm sorry, sweetie. I'll get you something. That stuff won't do any good. HE WHISTLES Mmm. How many times have I told you not to sit with your back to the door? You won't let me work in the living room. You know why. I'm a mess. Let's not get sarcastic about it. It was just an accident. OK, baby. Now, if this happens once more, I'm going to call it a habit. What were you so excited about? You got me so upset, now I forgot. Oh, yes, Carolyn and Bill Blakeley are breaking up. I know. Heard it on TV. I thought it was broken. I fixed it. What do you suppose was the matter? Wasn't plugged in. I mean the Blakeleys. I don't know. Maybe too much success. Whatever it is, fiver'll get you ten it's not her fault. He had plenty of gas and go right from the start, didn't he? Remember when we first met him? Carolyn and I had just started modelling for Bates... I should be finished in a week or two. Is it a mystery, Bill? It's more of a character study than a whodunnit. Sounds interesting. It's a wonderful play. You got a producer? George W Craig for one. The biggest in New York. How d'you get to him? Well, I... It was a friend of mine. He's a newspaper man. Wonder if I know him. Happy's a newspaper man, too. Oh? What do you do, Bill, besides writing plays? Nothing. You worked on a paper. Buffalo Journal. That's a good paper. Can't your friend land you something in New York? I don't want a job, Happy. You can't come home at night and write plays - it just doesn't work. I know, I've been trying to write a novel for 15 years. You'd take something to keep you in groceries, wouldn't you, Bill? I guess so. I'd prefer to gamble. Come on, Bill, you're not a gambler. A couple of bucks on a horse now and then. You haven't gambled a cent since I've known you. You can't gamble a cent. KNOCK AT DOOR The poker players. Lyn, help me clear the table. Hiya, boys, come on in. Oh, Bill Blakeley, this is Frank, Maddy, Mo... Oh, and Lyn Parker - Maddy, Frank, Mo... You don't have to help. I want to. Lyn, I know it's none of my business. But we've been friends since you came to town. I feel... Sweetie, that guy's nothing but an out-and-out tramp. No, he isn't. He'll be a great playwright, you'll see. You'll see. Incidentally, where does he sleep? In a rooming house on 46th street - top floor. I see. And he eats at your place. Dolly, that's not fair, I've only known him a few weeks. I thought by the way you acted that you liked him. I do. Nice-looking, polite, educated and sort of charming. That's the trouble. Oh, Dolly. How much is this? Five bucks. Pay after the game. The whites are five, the reds are ten, the blues a quarter. A nickel and dime except for a pair or on the last card. You playing, Mr Blakeley? We're going to a movie in a while. Dolly's got some passes, OK? Deal 'em, Mo. Where are we going? To the Rivoli, if that's all right. OK by me. Er, Dolly... Will you buy the tickets? I'll keep him busy. I said you had passes. I heard you. Ten. Up a dime. Bill, are you coming? The boys will want to win their money back. THEY MURMUR APPROVAL You go ahead. I'll be here when you get back. Good night, honey. Now, maybe you boys' luck will change. He hasn't one cent to his name. That's all right. He's winning. Supposing he were to lose? Happy would take care of it. What's a nickel and dime poker game? You're being unreasonable. To gamble when you've no money, that's real gambling. It's my fault. I forgot it was poker night. It won't amount to anything anyway. Of course not. Bates has got a new line of French coats for modelling. They're awfully smart. Not one cent. Better luck next time. Three in a row! BUZZ AT DOOR Hi. Hello. You slept well, didn't you? Like a log. I've never slept better. I'll get my coat. Why did you ask that? Why did I ask what? If I slept well. I thought you might be upset about last night. Had they finished when you got home? Just breaking up. I told Bill you were tired. You didn't say I was angry? No. Just what you told me to say. What did he say? Nothing. Didn't he think it rather strange? Why should he? You told me not to give the impression you were sore. I know. Hap says he's a great poker player. He was 12 ahead at one time, but he ended up 10 cents ahead. I'm not going to see him any more. Because he ended up with 10 cents? Because he's a gambler. Gambling his life away. Couldn't even stay out of a silly card game. You were right - he's a handsome, charming tramp. Don't you think I'm right? Absolutely. PHONE RINGS You think that's him? Answer it. Tell him what you just told me. That you don't want to see him again. Go on, give him the brush off. Go on. He's calling from a pay phone. So? If I answer, he'll lose his nickel. Oh, come on. That's stealing. Oh...! Hello! I mean, how've you been? Here. Oh, you can have it. Thanks. I thought this was my table. Mind if I sit down? I'm saving that place for Dolly. It's funny running into you here. I phoned you about a half-hour ago. You didn't answer. Didn't I? No. Are you sore about something? Why? Thought I might have done something. You certainly don't think I minded you playing poker with no money? And you can't think I minded going home alone? Sugar, I can explain. There comes a time when guys have to behave like men. There sure does. The chances of my losing were practically... Shush. Here's Dolly. Oh, hello. Hello. Soup for breakfast? Funny, isn't it? Where I come from, everyone has it. Up in New England, they have pie. What kind is it? It's his own special brand, isn't it, Bill? Yes, my own special brand. Those eggs smell good. Look good, too. Would you like one? Of course not. Go on, have one. If you insist. I shouldn't eat more than one anyway. Am I going to see you tonight? No, I don't think so. You have another date? Not exactly. I promised to take care of Timmy. I like Timmy. We won't be home till late. I'll wait for you at the studio. Well, we're not working at the studio. What time is it? A quarter to nine. We've got to hurry. We'll be late. Bye. Lyn, I'll meet you outside of Ma's house, huh? I suppose so. Bill was right about one thing. Boy can't work on a paper in the day and write a novel at night. Happy, you're not quitting your job. Honey, I'm so... BELL RINGS I'll get it. It'll be for me. Wilson's probably drunk again and I'll have to work all night. I'll never get this book finished. Wilson again? Yeah. All right! All right. I was right about that... Honey, baby, are you all right? Here, let me rub it. Honey, I don't know why I'm so careless. Taxi! Taxi! Morning Blade. Hi, Hap. Joe! What are you doing in this neighbourhood? I drive a cab, remember? I was going to drop in on you and Dolly. Yeah? How is she? Oh, she's fine. How you been? All right. And you? Can't squawk. You hear about Bill and Carolyn? What about 'em? Taken the cure. No! Yeah. Just got it on television, that Lawson dame. Dolly and I were just talking about them. When did you see them last? Mmm. Couple of months. They invited us out to Long Island. I couldn't go, so we didn't make it. I hear it's quite a joint they got. You know, Joe, I didn't think Bill would amount to a hill of beans. Boy, that first play. I remember when he made that deal with that fly-by-night producer... Joe, can I pay you later? I want to show Carolyn this 100 bill. Sure. I couldn't change it anyway! KNOCK AT DOOR Take a look at this, Sugar. Where did you get that? I sold my play. Oh, Bill! Tell me all about it. Rehearsals start tomorrow. I'm so glad for you. My landlady was glad, too. New suit? Not exactly. She let me have my trunk out of the basement. And why not ask me what time it is? Who did you sell your play to? James E Smalley. Haven't heard of him. I hadn't either until today. Here's the contract. Why is the 500 scratched out and 250 put in? Oh, that... He wanted cash for the production. You worked hard on that play. 250 instead of 500... We'll make a million! Who's going to direct it? Smalley. Has he directed a New York play? No. He had a stock company in Brockton. Where is Brockton? Massachusetts. We're going to have a hit. Believe me. Everything's going to be all right. Where d'you get the clothes? The dress is mine, I borrowed the wrap. Good luck, Bill! > Thanks. I'll need it. I'll pick you up after the show! Right. I'll meet you in the interval. I'd sit with you but I'm coming apart. Good luck. Don't worry, Sugar. Everything's gonna be all right. It's almost curtain time. I'm sorry, I stopped to talk to Bill. How does he feel? He's worried. Oh! Let's go. What time is it? Five minutes past ten. Thank you, sir. I don't see why I've got to sweep this floor, when they'll just mess it up again. < Not enough people left for that. What do you say, Harry? No sale, hey? No, brother. Oh, hello, Blakeley. Who is he? That's Harry Casino, he runs a ticket joint. Sometimes we can nurse a tired show into a success with cut rates. But when he says thumbs down, that's it. I see. I got to get up to the office. Mr Casino? Yeah. My name's Blakeley. Oh! Hi. Is it that bad? I'm afraid so. No chance at all, huh? There have been miracles, but not in showbusiness. Other shows started off bad. Yeah, but they started off. I'd like to be kind, Blakeley, but I'm not much of a liar. SOFT MUSIC PLAYS Bill. How d'you find me? I just figured, if I felt like you, where would I go? And here you are. Ready to go home? OK. Let's go. I've chiselled for two years to build myself up to a big letdown. It wasn't even a high-class flump, just was an out-and-out fizzle. Well, I've had my try and missed the boat. What will I do now? I doubt I could even get a job on a newspaper. Bright and early tomorrow, I'll try. No, you'll start on the third act of your new play. I can't, Lyn. You've got to. Look... I'll try working on it at night and get a job in the day. Like Happy? I can't go on kidding my friends and sponging off of you! I've been thinking about that, and... It wouldn't seem so much like sponging if it were sort of, well, partnership, would it? Partnership! Incorporating what? Your job, my nerve? Bill, do you love me? Of course I do, Lyn, but... You're making this very difficult. First I have to tell you I love you, then I have to ask if you love me... Lyn... Mr B, will you marry me or not? I bet it happens that way most of the time. MUSIC PLAYS AND CHILDREN SHOUT Hi, Joe. Hello, Carolyn. DOOR BUZZER Hi. What are you doing home at this time? I forgot my make-up kit. I'm sorry you found me looking like this. I'm just a wreck. I haven't done the dishes yet. I can take care of the apartment. I know, but now that you have me... Oh, please. You can't go on respecting me. I thought I'd sell my play and pay you back. But it's been months. You ought to get out and get some air. I think I ought to get some air, too. Plenty of it. What are you talking about? I'm talking about taking the air, getting out. This afternoon I'll see if I can't get a good word from someone. If not, I'm...moving out. When I get a break, I'll come back. This living off you is no good. I feel like a heel all the time. Where are you going? I don't know. You're going to walk out on me just because of your pride. I'll be wondering where you are, how you're getting along. I have to go. I'll be late. You'll be here when I get back, won't you? I've got to get some money somewhere. PHONE RINGS Hello. ..Yeah, this is William Blakeley. What? Venus Motion Picture Company.

If they're kidding I'll kill myself. Hey, Joe! I've got to get to Radio City. Can I pay later? Yeah. I got news. Your slip is showing! Oh! Hello, Ma. Evening. Is Bill upstairs? No, he came banging down the stairs like the place was on fire. I asked him what was the matter, but he didn't say. Oh dear. Bill? Bill? Bill! Sugar, come here and sit on your lord and master's knee! But... Bill, you haven't done anything wrong? I committed robbery. No... I robbed the Venus Motion Picture Company. I swindled them! Oh, Bill! Ha, ha, ha! They paid me 4,000. Why are you crying? 'Cos I'm happy. Listen, go into the other room and put on that white evening gown. I'm gonna take you to the snazziest joint in town for dinner, to a show, then a nightclub. Hurry! I'll be right back. Hey, Joe. Hi, Bill. How'd she take it? She cried. No! I want to rent your cab for the evening. All right. Don't take any other passengers. < Oh! What's the matter? < You startled me. I'm sorry. That's all right. So I startled you, huh? Y'know, Happy? He never showed that night... Hey, Joe! That's it. Hey, don't shout. I'm not deaf. Hello, Ma. Hello. Evening, Miss Crutcher. Hello, Joe. We are having coffee. How about you? No, I don't think so. Did you hear about the Blakeleys? Yeah. We were just talking about it. Remember how upset he was when I brought Carolyn back from Dr Strong? But how happy he was... What a big secret it was gonna be! Gosh! Ma, have you seen Lyn? Not this afternoon. Why? She was due back two hours ago. Where was she going? To the market. I looked for her and she wasn't there. Oh. Oh! Lyn, where have you been? Miss Crutcher, this is my husband. How d'you do? Look, you're two hours late. Is anything wrong? Of course not. Thank you for introducing me to the doctor. Doctor? I'll see you later, Mrs Blakeley. What is all this about doctors? There's something wrong. There's nothing wrong, Bill. Why this evasiveness? Can you take a shock? I have to! What is it? You're going to be a father. Oh. Are you sure? That's what the doctor said. Doctor... Is he a good doctor? There are all kinds of doctors. What I mean... Is he a specialist? He is. Miss Crutcher took me, she's a nurse. Gee, I...hope it's a boy or a girl. Look, you take care, I gotta tell Joe! Good evening. Hello Mrs Wallace. You know what's happening? You're going to be a father. Yeah... Yeah, that's right. INAUDIBLE Hey, Joe. You know why my wife went to see the doctor? Yeah. Yeah...I thought you did. Hiya, Timmy! Hi. You know what's gonna happen? The stork's gonna see you. Yeah...the stork's gonna see me. Where have you been? I went to see Pop. Why? I wanted to tell someone that didn't know. Nobody knew I suspected until I went to the doctors. I expect Ma's been peddling the news around. Oh. What are you doing? Working out how much things will cost. I can work for a while. You shouldn't... We'll need all the money we can get. We wouldn't manage without the 2,000 left over from the play. I can't find your bank statement. Where is it? I don't know. It should be there, shouldn't it? Well, the last statement I have is for June. There are two missing. Yeah? You haven't been gambling, have you? Gambling? How did you get started again? It was about a month ago. At Pops, a guy came over with a hot tip - I bet 50 on it. And lost. No, I won 200. I thought I'd work it into something big. I had some bad luck, that's all. How much is left? 600 or 700. 600 or 700? 632. Don't be upset. Craig's interested in my play, and maybe buying it. Everything will be all right. Craig! You don't even know Craig. I'm sick of the phrase, "Everything will be all right." My father used to say it. But...I'm not like your father! I keep trying to get ahead, don't I? If it comes to the worst, I'll have to get an advance from the boss. Sure. Sure, get it from your boss. He always plays the hero! Tell him...tell him we'll name the kid after him! Three o'clock. Something must have happened to him. Come, dear. He's all right, more's the pity! He was so desperate, he must have worried for weeks. I didn't say much. Sometimes it's better to say things. Nothing whips a man like a righteous woman. I wasn't righteous, Ma, just dazed. Stunned. 'Course. Too bad you didn't clout him one! Then you could have kissed and made up. I'll fix you some coffee. I... PHONE RINGS Hello? Hello, Bill? Don't be too sweet to him. I was wondering... Remember, you gotta live with him. Busy...? Too busy to telephone! You were too busy to telephone? What rush? The Golden Key? What are you doing? But Bill, you didn't have to... Yes? Six o'clock. All right. All right, Bill. Bye! He's taken a job as a waiter in the Golden Key restaurant. No kidding! Why do you suppose... He had to find work after what happened. He wants work, but why as a waiter? Why not a newspaper reporter? He had to get a job. Maybe there weren't any newspaper jobs. Besides, a waiter at a joint like the Golden Key makes more money than a newspaper reporter. I suppose it was the money he was thinking about. A waiter. This I gotta see. Hurry! Boss is in an uproar. Bonsoir, Bill. Oui, oui. Bonsoir to you. Late again. I'm, er...I'm sorry. I had to take my wife to the doctor. Excuses, always excuses. There's a difference between a bar towel and a napkin. Sorry. What's the matter with your wife? She's having a baby. Baby, huh? That's the reason I took this job. Well, go to station four and take Mr Craig's order. Craig? Uh-huh. The producer? That's right. Don't forget to show him the wine list! I won't. Good evening, sir. Good evening. I'll have half a dozen oysters, the cod, and... How's the roast beef? Excellent. Make it medium rare. And I'll have coffee later. Coffee later. Hello, Lyn? Listen carefully. There's something I want you to do. Take my new play down to Joe. If Joe isn't there, get Ma to do it. Bring it to the kitchen right away. Oh...um...how do you feel, dear? I'll explain later. I'm glad to hear...Good. Bye! Dessert, sir? No thanks, just the cheque, please. Cheque. Thank you. There you are. Thank you, sir. Good night. Good night, sir. Hmm. I'm OK. I should have gone to the opening. I thought it would be less nerve-wracking here. Oooh! Don't be silly, Ma, it's only a stitch. Lyn! > No, I don't want him worrying. He's got to sometime. Hello, Ma. Is something wrong? Of course not. How did it go? Why are you in bed? I was tired, Ma thought I should be. Ma's right. What about the show? I'm not sure, but when people came out, they all seemed to like it. That's wonderful. I wasn't worried. I wonder what the critics will say. We'll get the papers in the morning. A glass of milk? No thanks... ..A hot one at that! Yes. You know what I'm going to do? If the show's a hit, I'm gonna buy a house, maybe on Long Island. It will be wonderful for the child. And a nursery, and a nurse so it won't be too tough on you. And a cook. And when it gets older, I'm gonna send him to Harvard, Yale. Then I'm gonna set up an annuity. He will have nothing to worry about. What did Mr Craig think? He thought it was a hit. And so did Mrs Craig. It took 16 curtain calls. Ohh! 16? That's...Oooh! Four-and-a-half minutes. Eh? What...is something wrong? Why are you watching the clock? Four-and-a-half minutes? Since the pain. What does that mean? Nearly time for the hospital. You mean... But...it can't be. It's only the 25th March. It's not until May. Isn't it? Of course. Did you see Happy and Dolly? Yes, during the second act. Oh! No wonder four-and-a-half minutes. That clock is fast! What are you doing? I'm calling the doctor. I'll get Miss Crutcher. Hello? Hello? Oh, she's at the hospital. Oooh! Ooooh! Oooh! Two-and-a-half minutes! That was him! What is it? Something I ate. What did you have? Nothing. He's hungry. I'll get Mrs Wallace. I'd better go to the hospital. You think so? Be careful. Oh, the doctor. Mrs Wallace! Mrs Wallace...Oh! Who's excited? I'm telling Joe to wait. Oooh! You were off-side! SHOUTS: Joe! Joe! Taxi! HE WHISTLES West Park Hospital...wait a minute! I'll pay the gas, Bill will forget. Don't worry. I'll take that. Ooh! Stomach ache? I'm OK. He's hungry. He's scared. Leave that, I'm all right. Good evening. Good evening. You look peaky, Mr Blakeley. He hasn't eaten. See that cocktail bar there? Tell Jerry the bartender that I sent you. I want to go with you. Can I? You don't need to. I take care of the mothers, Jerry the fathers! But I want to... I'll phone you over there. You don't understand. Go on, Bill, have something to eat. Lyn! Don't worry, sugar, don't be afraid. Dr Strong's one of the best doctors in town, I checked. You're not afraid, are you? There's nothing to be afraid of is there, Doctor? Of course not. Everything will be all right. Everything will be OK. What time d'you have, Jerry? Quarter to two. That's right. There's nothing wrong with the phone? I don't think so. I'll make sure. PHONE JANGLES 'Operator? 'Just wanted to make sure the phone was in order...thank you.' It's all right. I wonder what's keeping Tony. The papers should be out. Uh? I said, the papers should be out. Oh, yeah. How many curtain calls did you say the show got last night? 16. Yeah, I remember you told me that. 16 - that's pretty good. At last! Where you been, Tony? To get the newspapers! Keep it. Thanks. Here, get back to your job. Say, this is a swell one! Listen to this: "Mr William Blakeley writes one of the funniest comedies seen in years. The play abounds wit, tenderness and charm. Superbly staged..." PHONE RINGS Hello... Yeah, this is he. How's my wife? Good. And the baby? But you're sure my wife's all right? Yeah, of course. That's the important thing. Yeah, thanks. Thanks, doc. Hey, here's another swell one. "Mr Blakeley is to be congratulated on reaching new stature as..." I hoped your wife would have shown some improvement by now. At first she cried continuously, but you warned me to expect that. I thought I'd buy a house, so I found one near the Craigs on Long Island. She didn't complain or criticise, but she just wasn't interested. Melancholy. She's always liked pretty things. Several times I suggested that she go shopping with Mrs Craig and buy a new wardrobe. She'd buy it, bring it back. But no enthusiasm. Sometimes a change of scene helps. I took the show on the road. I persuaded her to go along with me. She spent most of her time in the hotel. I haven't heard her laugh in months. Cigarette? Thanks. She's grieving over her inability to have a child. Have you brought up the subject of adoption? No, I haven't. You see, I kinda hoped I'd have one of my own. Are you sure it's impossible? Are you sure that there's no chance at all? Sorry, Bill. No chance at all. That's all right. Thanks. Snooty, huh? Oh, well, I didn't see you. That's because I'm getting thinner. How are you? All right. You? OK. Timmy, you remember Mr Blakeley? Sure, Carolyn's husband. That ought to put you in your place. How's your mother? She's sick. Well, that's too bad. Don't worry, Timmy. She'll be all right soon. She won't go to hospital because she feels she can't afford it. Be sure that she goes and have them send me... I'll take care of it. Oh, Bill! I can take care of Timmy while she's gone. How's Carolyn? Not so good, Ma. You see, she's... Just a minute. Timmy, how would you like to visit us for a while? We have a house on Long Island with a pool and you can be with Carolyn. Ma, do you think Mrs Wallace would mind? No, I guess not. I have to go. You pack his things and I'll send a car. I'll call Carolyn and tell her Timmy's coming. OK. Timmy will be good for her and she'll be good for Timmy. By the time Mrs Wallace gets out, Lyn will be her old self. On your marks, get set... Go! Hiya! Hello. Hello. I can dive! You wanna see me dive? I'd love to see you dive. Look, Uncle Bill! Boy, that's great! You wanna see me swim a length? You mean... I don't believe it! Good kid, isn't he? I wanted his mother to come here but she said no. The doctor thinks she'll be out of hospital soon. Yes, I know. Look, Lyn. You're not going to let losing him upset you, are you? Of course not. But I wish there was some way we could keep him. Me too. I'd give anything to keep him. Look, I can swim a whole length! Well, stop yelling and swim! What did I tell you? Wanna see me dive again? No, you've had enough. PHONE RINGS Blakeley residence. Sorry, they're down at the... Oh, just a minute. Mrs Blakeley, telephone. Hello. Hello, Ma, how are you? What?! But only yesterday the doctor said she was all right. Yes, Ma. What is it, Lyn? Timmy's mother. I thought she was feeling better. Just a few minutes ago I wished there was a way we could keep him. I feel as th... Don't be ridiculous. Wishing had nothing to do with it. How will we tell Timmy? I'll tell him. Bill told me all about the adoption. To hear him tell it was his idea. He's made the kid a good father though, I admit that. Yes, sir. I don't believe a word about their divorce. I don't either. Maybe Lawson's column will carry a retraction. I'll see if I can get one. Your paper, Mr Craig. At last. May I? Oh, yes, I guess so. Oh, yes. Here it is. Did I do something wrong? Oh, no. Everything's just lovely. George! I've only five minutes... This is important, read it. Isn't that the most astonishing thing? I saw Carolyn yesterday and she never said a word! You'd think she'd say something to me. We're pretty close friends. Perhaps it's not true. Then why is it here? Has Bill spoken to you? Answer me! Has Bill said anything to you? Is there another woman? I bet there is. He has said something to you, hasn't he? Is it that Booth woman? What Booth woman? What Booth woman! The one in your new play. Oh, Janet. Yes, Janet! What gave you that idea? Looks like a husband snatcher to me. You say that about all my actresses. They appeal to you. I remember ten years ago, that Drake woman... You're not bringing that up again? I get exasperated. You're always picking that same type of woman. Look, we were talking about Bill and Carolyn, remember? That Newton girl you just happened to run into in Atlantic City... Stop it! Besides, I didn't discover Janet. Bill found her. He has carte blanche on everything backstage. # Another heart that craved affection # Another souvenir # To add to your collection # I call you Kiss & Run # You knew how hard I'd fall # Mmmm, was it fun? # And did you have a ball? # And where there's love I know... # Put a call in for Mrs Blakeley, will you Bob? # ...with none # Kiss # And Run. # Bob, are you leaving? Yes. Made up your mind? Yes. Kiss me goodbye. There's no reason for phoney dramatics. No, no, no! Look, Frank! Frank, you just struggle so far. Look, I'll show you. See? Get over the fact that... All right, try it again. You're not giving me the same reaction, baby. Blow it, buster! I've got Mrs Blakeley on the phone. All right, let's take a break. Hello, Lyn? What's wrong with Timmy? Tooth? That's not serious, is it? Nothing serious, but it has to be attended to immediately. I'd rather be there with you. I can be there Wednesday or Thursday. Now which is it, Wednesday or Thursday? Well, I should think Thursday. Well, be sure, Lyn. The show opens Friday and I want you here with me. You've been to all the openings. I know, but you're not superstitious. I'm not superstitious. I just miss you, that's all. You be sure and be here Thursday. OK, sweetie. Bye. Looks like another hit. I'll call my wife and give her the good news. Yeah, your wife'll be interested. What do you mean by that? Well, Lyn isn't concerned. Bill, don't be ridiculous. Well, she isn't here, is she? Weren't they wonderful? Yes. And you were wonderful too. You gave an excellent performance. See you in the Oyster Bar, Bill. You were embarrassed when I kissed you. Of course not! You weren't? George, why is Janet in all Bill's plays? She had her first part in his first play. Sentiment I guess. You mean... No no! How do you know what I mean and why did you leave him with her? I had to arrange the New York opening. Besides, Bill's old enough to vote. No man is old enough to vote when another woman's concerned! I'm going to tell Carolyn. You don't tell a wife her husband's mixed up with another woman! It just isn't done. Maybe not by men, but women operate differently! Where would we be if Ann hadn't called me and told me all about that Newton girl? So that's how she found out. Bill was furious when I didn't meet him. I started watching Lawson on TV. All these friends started calling so I took the receiver off the hook. I tried to get you. Then I phoned Lucy Lawson. She says she got the story from a reliable source in Philadelphia. She didn't say who it was. I can't believe that Bill would go so far over a silly argument. It isn't silly. You've been wrapped up in Timmy and neglected Bill. It's not true. It is! You mothered Bill until he became a success. Then you turned to Timmy. Well, I've got news for you. Bill still needs a mother too. And a wife... Or reasonable substitute thereof. What are you talking about? Holding a husband. You let your man go on the road with another woman. Another woman?! Janet Booth. No, not Bill. Not so much Bill as Booth. So that's the way it is. Since time began, dear. What are you going to do? I'm going to Philadelphia. Now you're using your brain, but don't go in like an irate wife. Ma, where are you going? I'm going to Philadelphia, Timmy. Would you? Sure, I'll take care of him. Are you going to see Uncle Bill? I certainly am. What's Uncle Bill done? What you'll do when you get old enough. Why don't you come over for breakfast? Breakfast? Yes, I have my own coffee maker. Oh? That's nice. You made a bad entrance? No. Just go over the script a bit. Had your breakfast? No. What'll it be? Don't bother, Bob. I'll call them later. OK. Hello, operator? Give me Miss Booth's suite. It's Mr Blakeley. Thank you. It can't be! I haven't done anything yet! At least not until just now and then only as far as the door! Listen, there was no truth... Well, all we did was... Go to lunch, dinner a couple of times. Then one other thing. Before I read that stuff in the paper, I was sitting in my room. She came in to talk about her part. I don't know exactly how it happened but I kissed her. She invited me to her room for some coffee and I wanted some coffee. So I went out in the hall and then I started thinking about you. I went right back into my own room. You'll never get away with it, bud. All aboard! What are you doing with that Booth woman? I leave you for two minutes... Now just a minute! Who wrote that thing? I thought you... Certainly not! Then Lawson's a liar! Yes. Why did you believe her? I didn't. Look, Lyn, about this Booth woman... I don't want to hear about it, even if you did! But Lyn! Hey, the trains! The station master just told me there won't be another train past here for two years. Two years! I guess there's nothing left for us to do but find a hotel.
