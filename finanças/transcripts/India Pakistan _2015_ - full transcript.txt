In the 5000 crores-worth fake title-deed scam case on Chennai beach road, ... distributor Ravi was arrested two days ago. As he tried to escape en-route from Puzhal prison to the court, the police shot him dead. My son would not have attempted to escape. He has been framed and encountered to save some big shots. Hello. Can I get a smaller piece? Please wait, let me check. Is he dull-witted or what? He has taken a toy gun, out of its cover too. How much is this? How much? Madam, can I help you? Oh, I am sorry. I assumed you were a sales boy. You can take it. No problem, you can have it. Please, take it. Have it. - You can have it. - You took it first. Excuse me. There are two copies, you both can have it. The bill counter is at the left corner. You can pay there. Yours, sir. - Thank you. - Yours, madam. They think they're Vijay and Shalini? I am Haridas. The best house broker in South India. Please contact me to buy and sell houses and house plots. If you want idli with chutney approach me. You can't spell 'fast-food' but you claim to be the owner. You dare to advertise your Idli and chutney too! - What a stink! - I didn't do anything. He has opened the idli cooker. I'll become a spirit if I smell this. Why isn't the Poori fresh? - How long can it stay fresh? - It hasn't been made today? Nothing has been made today. Didn't you see the board? 'PAST food'. - Give me pongal. - And for the pongal? Give me your trousers, shirt and some pocket money. I was talking about side dishes. As if you have eight-variety dishes! Give me that same damn chutney. Enough. Do you want vada? You mean firebrand? OK. Hey, why is a thread coming out of it? - Got torn. I stitched it together. - You stitched it? Yes. Where is the chef? It's been one week since he left for his hometown. - What about this vada then? - He made it before leaving. Oh! Damn you all. Why did you leave the table? - I want to live a little longer. - This is Das. - OK, thanks. - Here comes a client. Yes I am Das. Haridas. The best house broker in South India. What can I do for you? I am Karthik. I am a lawyer and I need a house for rent. A lawyer? - You look too timid. Can you raise your voice? - Yes, I can. It's hard to find a house for a lawyer. House owners fear you would sue them. - Since you approached me, I'll try. You have a bike? - Yes. - Can you give me a ride? Do you drive well? - Yes Then get your bike. Too tall. Only Anushka can ride this. It's the house on the left. Stop. My back is aching. This is the 11th house I am showing you. Somehow arrange this house for me. - That's my line. If you don't like it, I'll arrange a film set for you. - OK The house owner is sharp. Keep your voice down. This is the best house in the area. The owner leaves you the plants, the old newspaper, the bucket and everything. I can fix this if it's OK. The rooms are very spacious. I don't need that much space. How much is the rent? 20,000 as rent and an advance of 10 months. Oh! I can't afford 20,000. Negotiate the rent. - Impossible. - I told you he is sharp. He's listening from downstairs. Control yourself, you flirt! Who is she? The milk vendor. When a house is available, many will hop in to check. - Hey Paramasivam, is she yours? - I don't deserve her, man. With such a rotten face you need a charming girl like her? I asked if she is your client. - Yes. - She is looking for office space. - Do you like it? - Yes, I do. I'm also impressed. - I am very impressed. How... - I am very impressed too. Why is he groping me? I need this office. How much is the rent? 20,000, plus an advance of 10 months. 20000? I can't afford that and I don't need such a big space... Don't miss the house gawking at that girl, Karthik! Ask! Sir, I saw and confirmed the deal first. Isn't it? - Please fix it for me. - Let me speak with the loud mouth. - Sir, fix it for me immediately. - I will, madam. - Das, you know me well? - I do. But they say the house is too big. Can I make it smaller? Check if they're willing to share it. They can share the rent then. OK. What happened? He won't reduce the rent. Since the girl also feels the house is too big, you could share it. Is she OK with it? Paramasivam is checking. If it is OK with her, will you agree? - That's OK as long as she's not a lawyer. - She won't be a lawyer. Don't worry, man. If he agrees, I don't mind. - Hey, Paramasivam, my client has agreed. - Madam too. Then give 1 lakh as advance. Why does he act like it's a register marriage? Will he ask for a garland? - I'll take that room. - I'll take the other one then. - Hey, are you riding the pillion? - Yes. - The hot seat might blister your piles. - Your not my doctor. Get lost. You can watch daily from tomorrow onward. Let's go. - Her dress is lovely, isn't it? - Shall I borrow it for you? - If we are in the same profession, it'll be a hassle. I don't need that. - I don't think so, madam. It's hard for lawyers to get office space. So, a house? - Hey fast-food, two teas. - With milk. This tea is enough to finish you off. - How much is your commission? - Why? Don't you know it is 10,000? - OK, find out that girl's profession. - Alright. - What? - What is that girl's profession? Lawyer. Seems like I'm gonna lose my money! She's a software engineer. Your accent is wrong. It's 'software engineer' Right. First thing, I must move out. Check out his profession. - What now? - What is that guy's job? Lawyer. - Manager in some marketing sector, it seems. - OK, then. How long will you count the cash? Give it. Now that you have successfully clinched your deal, won't you give me a treat? - Treat? You want sambar rice? - No. I want booze. Booze? Take off your hand. I get you a house, a girl for company... And now you want booze! What do you think of me? You look like my childhood friend who ran away. Get on the bike, dude. Hey, dude, this place is so colorful! Who are these musclemen? Bouncers. What about him? I'm their master. He looks like a baby lizard! Let's run away before he spits. Order, please. A light beer for me. For you? First, get me two large. One lime cordial. And some ice cubes. Quick. - Is that enough? - I'll order more later. - Sir, side dish? - Get me scrambled eggs... ... salted green peas, 75 gm mixture... ... and a pack of Ravi's pickles. - We don't have that. You don't have Ravi's pickles in such a big bar? I can't believe it! - Grilled chicken, tandoori chicken, chilly chicken. - OK, sir. - You'll order the rest later? - Spot on, dude. You greedy monster! What if he comes to know the girl is a lawyer? You're lucky to share a house with such a beautiful girl. So why should you bother about her job? - What are your saying? - He's scolding me! You can't live with the competition... Even if she's pretty! - If that girl is a lawyer... - No, she is a software engineer. He's going to puke on me after eating all this. Look how he tears off the chicken leg! - Do you have my phone number? - Thanks for reminding me. I dug my own grave. First, I'll change my number. First... Hey listen, first comes only once. (Maybe he's using me to taste all these drinks.) - Boy! - Hey don't come. Hey, muscled men, bring me some roasted peanuts. That's not our job. Then what is your job, you pig-headed wastrels? If you stand folding your hands, does that make you Arnold? No use drinking if I can't squabble! I know monkey kung fu. Sit, I say! I sit only to honor your request. Sir, your bill. Sir, kindly take it. How much have they charged? How could you charge 5000? Sorry, this bill belongs to the next table. You saved my life, man. - How could you charge 10,000? - Yes sir, this is your bill. If I had known, I would have sat at the nearby table. Is this a bar or some place of extortion? How can you charge 10,000 for a bottle of beer? - Don't you have money? - Just 10,000. Don't worry. I'll pay the tips. He is such a miser. I'm the only person to have spent 10,000 on one bottle of beer. Hey, dude! What now? Do you hear Tabla music? No, I don't. - You can't hear it. Only I can. - How? Listen. Ready, start music. I saw a beauty that swept me off my feet I saw a beauty that swept me off my feet She pierced through my heart without a bullet A beautiful girl and a gorgeous women to build a home with She in making me like the scary world of marriage Dreaming about her makes my nights long Thinking about her makes my mind restless She has made my nights sleepless I saw a beauty that swept me off my feet I saw a beauty that swept me off my feet She has changed by life completely I wonder what more is yet to happen I was a complete man, now broken in to pieces She has taken complete control over my heart and soul She is like a ghost in a horror film She is a exorcist that did dark magic on me She broke my heart in to pieces and made me want to be intoxicated I rode bicycle over the waves What are you looking at? A gorgeous woman with a style that mesmerizes me Eyes as deep as an ocean that sinks me in A glamorous woman that makes the entire world stare Lips that captivates my heart and soul Her dresses are intact Her smile is so bright She is like the delicacy in wine and dine dinner. She is my queen She spares no one after a glance I saw a beauty that swept me off my feet She pierced through my heart without a bullet A beautiful girl and a gorgeous women to build a home with She is making me like the scary world of marriage Dreaming about her makes my nights long Thinking about her makes my mind restless She has made my nights sleepless Hey, dude. The coffee will cool down. - I brought your things at the office. - Thanks, dude. Do you have any paste, mate? - There wasn't much left. - You could have told me. What if I had? - Here's a thousand. - OK, madam. - Hello. You brought your things already? - Yes. - Shall I help you? - It's OK. - No problem. - I'll take care of it. - No problem. - Haven't you brought your things? - A friend brought them earlier. - Oh! - Are you a lawyer? - You too? - Why did you lie to me? - What? I lied to you? You cheated me claiming to be a marketing manager. The guy who drank for 10000. Call cut. Oh, this girl? A marketing manager with your fish seller's looks! I should have been suspicious! You, a software engineer? I should have been wary! As a woman, aren't you ashamed to lie like this? I don't need to lie. I was born in an honorable family. Your family wasn't dishonorable but your birth probably disgraced it. You set up your office next to mine after finding out that I'm a lawyer to steal my clients? As if clients are going to throng your office. Get lost. Father, I am in a meeting with a high court judge. I'll call you later. You seem to speak only lies! Is it also a lie that you are a lawyer? I'm the only one in my batch to have passed with merit. - You did it just once, but I passed it three times. - Three times? - Oh, three attempts? - What 'attempts'? - I've laid a strong foundation. - Even after three attempts, I'm sure you used cheat notes. Meaning? You don't understand English? I said you must have cheated on that third attempt. You are teasing me too much. Get lost! - What? - Yes, get lost. You are a wastrel... OK, OK. Let's make peace. Bear with it for a month. I'll return your advance and take the office. No. You vacate the house. I'll return your money tomorrow. I can't. I need this office. I need this office too. - OK, let's do it this way. - What? Whoever gets the first case can claim this office. Are you scared? Scared? Who? Me? Listen, when it comes to challenges I'm like the wise Chanakya. My only concern is that I feel bad about competing with a woman. If you are bothered by my womanhood, you can let go of this office. OK, I accept the challenge. I'll change my name if I don't defeat and chase you away. If that's the pride of a bad student, imagine the pride of a meritorious one! If I don't find a case first and defeat you, I'll stop calling myself a meritorious student. - Let's see! - Yes, that's a challenge. Let's see that! You have a case? Oxford English Dictionary. Sir, please, buy one. He may need a one. - Do you need a lawyer? - No. - Do you need a lawyer? Kindly come to me, I passed law with merit. - No, I don't. Stay here. I shall be back. I won't go anywhere. Take your time. Does she have a case? - Isn't she a prostitute? He's going to be in trouble. - Case? - Yes. He is looking at us. Madam, let us go to a more peaceful place. That suits me too. Come. He is taking her somewhere. Hurry. Let's see what happens next. Madam, is this place fine with you? If you're comfortable, it's fine. Don't bother about the money. I am OK with any fee. So don't go to anyone else. You are my priority. What do you say? Tell me how much time you'll spend with me... Then we'll talk about the price. Time? Let's finish this quickly. You seem like you will need a long time. Not at all. I may not look like it... But when I get to it... I'm a tiger. We can finish it quickly. From now onward, I shall take over this case. Is that OK? Please give me an advance. Why should I? If I need to come with you, you need to pay. 5000 per day. Gosh, she's a hooker! You please don't worry. I shall take over this case. Sir is very quick. - Hey, look at the tiger. - No, he is a cat. That's my case. Case? The house owner sent me here. Kindly employ me, sir. You can take his job. Come. - If anyone comes, inform me first. - Yes, sir. - Don't forget. - OK. - What's your name? - Dheena. - Whoever comes inform me first. - OK. Keep this money. I may get more in bribes than in salary! Mani, bite her on the face! - I'm going to the tea shop. - Coffee for me. Dheena, Tea for me. There is only one flask. What to do? Why is this coffee so bad? I brought the tea and coffee in the same flask. Why did you use my flask to buy tea for him? Brother, she means you only. How can he drink that? You must use my flask only for me. - Why did you serve me tea in her cup? - I work in a madhouse. Hey, Dheena. My cup, my flask. From now on, you must serve tea in this for me and my clients. - Clients? - Yes, my clients. From now on we will have two flasks, buckets and brooms. What's the time on her clock? - Then on our clock it's 10:30. - Great idea. Sir, you won't get a better house in this area. If you don't like it, I'll create a film set for you. Is the bedroom to your taste? With the windows open, it will be awesome. Why are you so crude? You're from Ayodhi Kuppam? Such a twisted mind! - What's you name? - Kapali. Kapali? It is a short form for Kapaleeswaran. I meant the room will be airy if you keep the windows open. This place is in high demand. Someone is already here with an advance. Let's see the other bedroom. - The bathroom is too small. I can't sit and take a bath. - Then you can bath standing. Who is this? - Don't trust him. - What does he mean? - He urgently needs to use the washroom, it seems. - She needs to bathe here. So you can't. Come out. Why are you doing this? You drank for all the money you gave. You drank too. I drank? It was just a bottle of beer. I'm the first person to spend 10,000 on that. Knowing that she is a lawyer, you put me in trouble. You? She's the one in trouble! You're such a nuisance. Das, that girl and I are competing with each other. As if you were IPL owners! What kind of competition? Whoever gets the first case can claim the whole office. Ask her to drink a case of beer faster than you. You'll win. You can't trust her. She may drink too. What can I do about that? Get me a high-profile case. Case? I am a house broker, not a legal broker. - What would be my commission if I get you a case? - A huge party. There's a great 'case' known as Banganappalli Mangamma. Shall I get her for you? I am well aware of your parties... Let me work. I'll let you know if I find something. Leave. Mellina, our school headmaster inquired about you. He suggested a match for you. His friend's son, who lives in Chennai. Dad, I told you I'll inform you if I find someone I like. They're very interested. You can meet him as a formality. I'll meet him and reject him. OK? No problem, you should at least go see him. OK, dad. Where should I meet him? Hey, why did you bring me here? - To dine. - It's too early. Let's have a beer then. - Go ahead. I'll go to the washroom. - Hurry up. Mellina, isn't that Karthik? Yes, that's him. Her? - I think he's following me. - Why would he follow you? He is afraid I might get a case. Just wait. - I'll teach him a lesson. - Don't. The groom will be here soon. Groom or not, I'm going to send him away now. Mellina, please, stop. - Hey, why are you here? - To fill petrol. You are following me to find out if I got a case. You think I'm like you? No, I came to meet a client. Which client? You mean the woman you met at the court? Sir is very fast. Looks like he has taken over the case. You are crossing the line. Your parents gave you too much freedom. If you ever speak ill about my family, I won't spare you. You are Mellina, right? Who is he? I'm Selvam. I'm the one you're supposed to meet here. - Dude, how do you know her? - I'll tell you, mate. - He is the groom you are supposed to meet. - Groom? This guy? Your mom thought you wouldn't come if I told you the truth. That's why. Are you mad? Won't you do a background check if someone comes with a proposal? You sent a crook as a prospective groom. You should have selected his friend instead. - What are you saying? - I'm here to reject him anyway. Are you mad? How can you send such a girl as a prospective bride? She is a cheap girl. If you accept her as your daughter-in-law she'll break the family. Is she such a girl? Dad, I'll kill you if you continue to send such people as grooms. Not you, him. - Didn't I tell you she is a cheap girl. - Yes, mate. Please take her back to the mental hospital. - You were too harsh on him. - Let it be. Though both of you fight like cats and dogs you are always together. You are right. If he weren't my competitor for the office... ... this meeting would've been different. I may have accepted the proposal. What do you mean? When I was looking for an office... I saw him at Landmark. He was vying for my attention. He took the same Kadalukku Mariyadhai DVD that I took. Karunakaran has come seeking for you. Hello, sir. Her name is Mellina. A lawyer. A lawyer? Should I kidnap her or...? She got her hand on an important piece of evidence. Yet, it's not in the news. She either doesn't know she has it... ... or she is feigning ignorance. - Should I interrogate her? - No. She is a lawyer. If it blows into a huge issue... we won't be able to handle it. Don't worry, sir. I've done worse before. - I'll bring her to you. - OK. - Tell me Selvam. - Dude, I got you a case. What? A case? Just a minute... Tell me now. I told them about you. I forwarded your address. Worthy party, dude. Wait for them. I did my part as a friend, you do yours! Dheena... This is your sister's last day... ... in this office. Why do you say that? I got a case... Clients are on their way. I've won the challenge. I don't like to win against a woman... ... but it's a bet. It can't be help. This office is ours henceforth. Your burden will be cut down by half. We somehow got into disputes and challenges. But I'm not angry with you. I'll tell Das to find an office space for you. I'll also recommend cases, if any. I'll return your advance tomorrow. We've been sharing the same work place, but we haven't even seen each others' room. Come! Come and see my room, please. Come, take a seat. You've entered my room for the first time. Dheena, get us two coffees. So, how's my office? I think my client is here. It's time to depart. Let's be friends from now on. Hey stop, open the door. Open the door! My client is here. Fraud! Are you the client? Did Selvam send you? They are my clients. Leave them. I'm the advocate you've come to meet. He's insane. Let's go elsewhere to talk. Where are you taking them? Stop! - Where is she? - She left, bro. I'm the advocate Selvam referred. Whatever your trouble is... I'm your lawyer. What's your problem? Didn't I tell you? He always blabbers like that. I'm the crazy one? It's you! Don't believe her, sir. She's a fraud. Your friend referred me. - Tell me. - We need a divorce. For your son or daughter? Why are you interrupting? Shut up. Who is it for, your son? We couldn't have kids, that's why we're divorcing! This late? What were you doing till now? Trying. What? For a baby? Don't worry. I'll take care. What? You'll get them a baby? I'm your advocate. I'll take care. - Don't worry. - I'll handle your case, don't worry. Solve your case first, and then come to us. Come on, let's move. Stop sir, please! Get lost! Eh! Stop! - Why are you going that far? - I'll knock you out. I'm India, you're Pakistan. Let's clash! I'll crush you into pieces. I can hit 7 sixes in 6 balls, I can take 10 wickets in 8 balls. I'll bowl your wickets down in the first ball and drive you away from our place. Ask the world about me, I am the Spider Man. Better in all aspects, I am the Super Man. Not a word beyond what is needed, Not a failure I have faced. Beware and go on your way. I'm the son of courage, I am bound by law, I'll rip you apart in pieces. I'll feed you all the rotten food in the world, and drive you away for life. I'll tear your clothes into pieces, And give you the persona of a beggar. I'll make the world see you as a newly found creature on earth. No one in this world has won, head- on against me. You possess the brain of a headless chicken, the world has not yet seen. I'm India, you are Pakistan. Let's clash I'll crush you into pieces. I can hit 7 sixes in 6 balls, I can take 10 wickets in 8 balls. I'll bowl your wickets down in the first ball and drive you away from our place. The house owner called me several times. Seems you aren't paying the rent. I gave it this morning. She probably didn't. She's a cheat. Enough stories. She gave it this morning. You need to give it now. Then, you'll have Rs10,000 in your pocket. Give me the rent first! - You stupid! - Stop the vehicle. He's a policeman. Why did you scold him? He's coming! What is it? Take your hand off! Why are you fighting, being in top professions? - He is an advocate, sir. - Take your hand off. People are looking. Leave him. It'll create troubles. Come as soon as I call the ambulance. It's a public area, highly risky. At last, the witness withdrew his words! We'll know post lunch. By the way, you brought lunch? - He is a policeman. He'll take revenge. - So what? - I'm an advocate. I know what to do. - Use him for free party? Civil, crime... Careful... Paavada! He's calling you. - Paavada? - Ya. - There's no one with that name. - He is the one. He is calling you 'Paavada'. Will anyone have such a stupid name? Why are you getting angry? I'm stylishly named Haridas! What Paavada? - You are Paavada. He is lying. - He is Haridas, and not Paavada. I know, you're Paavada. The tea is yuck, I'll pour it on your face. I'm not Paavada, just go. Swear on the deity of our town! I swear on the deity of our homeland, I'm not Paavada! Then it's you, Paavada! I swore on the deity. Why don't you believe me? You said it yourself... ... 'our' homeland! - You see! - Hey, there's no Paavada here. Go! Our people have come from the town. I'll insult you in front of everyone. Please, hold on, please, listen to me. You disgusting idiot! I agree, I'm Paavada. Yeah, that's good. You tribal, why have you come here? Kaatamuthu and Marudhamuthu have been in a land dispute for years. The panchayat can't solve it, so we've come to this court. What? A case? Aama Kunju sir, I'm an advocate. Do you have a lawyer? I can't find anyone! Go freshen up and look for an advocate! I'm an advocate. Don't say that. You don't know them. Let's have lunch instead. Why? Sir looks very decent. I doubt that you're planning to refer the case to her. I'll deal with this. - Are you an advocate? - Of course, see my coat. I'll take you to my boss then. Who is your boss? My boss' name is Kaatamuthu! He also has another name. What? Again Kaatamuthu! Look, he is insane by birth! You will end up with weirdos! Don't disturb my client. Come, sir. He is also here! - Paavada, how are you? - Idicha Puli, glad to see you here! - Looks like you've gained a lot of weight! - Overeating! - Why are you here? - Same land dispute! They came with Kaatamuthu, and I'm here for Marudhu. You referred them an advocate. Can't you do that for me? Is that like catching rats to get one each? - You got a case for him, why not for me? - Why are you behind cases? They are so strange. Please listen to me. - I'm an advocate too. Let's go. - Very good! The judge wants a home with an attached bathroom. I need to show him one. - Where is Marudhu sir? - At the Panchayat. Who are they? Organizing a panchayat outside the court? The one in the white shirt, sitting like a roaring lion is Kaatamuthu sir! He is of huge repute in our town. - Who is he? - He is the opponent, Marudhu sir! He is of great repute too, but lesser than our boss. Let me introduce you to him. Come. Aama Kunju is here. - He will argue in our favor. - Hello, I'm Advocate Karthik. I asked you to get an advocate, didn't I? He is one. I'm a lawyer. Say hello. Look at his lawyer's coat. What are you doing? Isn't it obvious? It's a panchayat. We roamed around the court. This is the biggest tree, so we fixed the panchayat here. Who told you it would be done here? - What is it, boss? - It won't be here? - Sorry boss! - I told you! That tree is the biggest. You followed these idiots and brought me here. Come on, let's go. Court arguments don't take place under a tree. Where else? I'll tell you. Let's go to my office to finish the formalities and come back here. Okay, come. Stop. Will you keep on following them wherever they go? Check out where they are heading to. Annachi, I'm here. - Isn't he Paavada? - Yes, indeed. - What is he doing here? - He is roaming here! Who is she? She is our advocate. We need to argue through her. Don't I know how to talk? We need to talk through a mediator here. Come on, let's to go my office. Where to? Leave way, move away! Looks like they never tasted these snacks before! Give one to me, for me... Won't you let me bring snacks inside just once? I need to tie the knot with a Madras girl before leaving. They look so pretty! Is he meditating? And does he keep silent like he's waiting for something? - Details about the case... - Don't talk aloud. Why? Won't he talk? He won't talk unless he receives a sign from the Lord! He needs to receive a sign? What sign? Anything like a bell sound, a cow's mooing, etc. What for? When he was born, all 12 planets fell in-line. So, he will never utter a word without the approval of the Lord. This looks like a land dispute, as per your statement. This will not fall under a criminal case. It's just a civil case. Right, we aren't criminals. So, as you said... - Civil - Yeah, civil. Let's do that. But you need to charge him under a criminal case! He is a tactful criminal. Son of the Sangiyam! Oh, so his dad's name is Sangiyam! There is the sign from the Lord. - Annachi started to speak! - What's your name? Mellina... Her name complies with numerology. You can talk to her. I could leave that that land even if it contained treasures... ... but it's our motherland. We've been owning it for generations. These fellows dissolve the panchayat whenever we discuss the issue. Handing it over to them would be like getting a girl married to a handicapped! Kaatamuthu's Zodiac sign never falls under any control! - He is an alien born to Ammavasai! - Ammavasai. If the judgment is in my favor, justice will live forever, but it'll die out if not! A small doubt... Who is Maruthu's father? Sangiyam or Ammavasai? What does he mean? Just now you said 'son of Sangiyam' and 'born to Ammavasai'. Sangiyam? He didn't understand, boss. Why don't you explain? For example, my boss' granny passed away. What did we do? - What did we do, bro? - What did you do, sir? We buried her. Why are you saying something irrelevant? Ammavasai means 'no moon day'. The scariest dark day! Let me tell you. His grandfather is Naadi Muthu, My grandfather is Naaga Muthu. The land is in the name of my grandfather. Got it? Now, from Naadi Muthu. No, sorry, from Naaga Muthu... He didn't understand this time either. Okay, get ready. Let's visit our town and see to it. Stop praying. They're heading to the town with the advocate. Is it? Let's go with our advocate then. No need to visit the town. You just need to give me the survey number of the land. - What is a survey number? - Survey number? Survey number? - It's not here! - What is a survey number, dude? Ask a well-educated person in your town. They'll know. In our town, boss is the most educated. Third standard! He got 1st rank 6 times. Look, he is stunned on hearing your qualification. Bro, you get ready. Let's talk in our town. They are going to the town. We need to go too. Get up, we shall move. Advocate agreed to visit our town. We'll go to town and I'll propose to her. He is going to the town with the advocate. We need to go too. They are going to the town. They are going to the town with the advocate. Didn't I tell you they are criminals? They are going with the advocate. We are going too. Lift him up! I need to escape from these people. Are they all mad? Everything went on well? I'm leaving. Pen me a letter. I'll come for the festival. So much love for your homeland! When is the festival? - Tomorrow, boss - Then lift him up! They're taking Paavada. Don't you care? I already predicted this according to your horoscope! Why did you allow them to take him away? Let's deal with this in town. Is this what you're here for? Shut up and come! I won our challenge. Vacate the office and run away. - I got the same case you've got - But I got it first. Both of us got the same case on the same day. This office will belong to the one who wins the case. - You will lose this too. - Let's see... ... who is going to lose - Challenge! - Shall we go? - Boss! Wake him up. Got the sign. Let's go. - Paavada! - Tell me, boss. Why did you run away secretively? Else, you wouldn't have let me! I went chasing a kite that flew away... I went till Chennai chasing it. I didn't know the way back. So I settled there with the kite. If you had left a trail of peanuts... You would have eaten them? No, you could've used that to find the way back. - Are they all mad? - What are you whispering bro? I was inquiring about your town. This is a precious land! We've never had any police station here. Outsiders are afraid to step into our town. Our boss takes care of everything. Since he, himself, is in trouble, we've come out seeking help! We're known for our guts and respect. Besides, our boss can fight ten people at the same time. Why are you laughing? Tell him, Paavada. He is that brave, bro, believe me. Aama Kunju... Even movies don't make such jokes nowadays. - He can, bro, believe me. - Aama Kunju! - He doesn't believe it boss - Leave it! Beat these rogues! Thrash them! Kaatamuthu has come. - Wait. Someone, please, explain. - I'll explain, boss. We were working in the mill. We faced a power cut then. Someone raped her at that time. These four men were present there. Thirupathi, place the chair there. Tell me the truth, or I'll just kill you. It wasn't me, boss. Boss, she will give birth to a baby anyway. We can find out the rapist by looking at the face of the baby. - What if the baby looks like her? - We'll dissolve the panchayat then. Nasty fellow! Go away. Take him away. I'll find out. Bro, pick up the stone lying near you. Sir, it's not him. Paavada, how can he tell it's not him? He takes such a long time to even bend, how's that possible for him? - When did it happen? - Just half an hour ago. Sir, he is the one who raped her. - Please forgive me, boss! - Get up. Don't feel so proud. Super, bro. Brilliant! This is why we should always have an educated person with us. You can stay here. Be with me. I'll refer ten cases every month. Hail our boss Kaatamuthu! He will continue doing it if we leave him. So give him the special punishment. Hail Kaatamuthu. What is that special punishment? You don't know, right? It's a punishment similar to the treatment they use... ... to make the bull sterile! - The house is so beautiful, sir! - He constructed it with all his heart! Stand in line. - What is this foul smell? - It's cow dung! - Cow dung? - Yes, they sprinkle it to get rid of bad omen. I guess the cow has an upset stomach. They've fed her with rotten food. - Who is he calling? His daughter? - Wait and see. Bairava, come on! - Such a big dog! - It will eat 10kg of meat per meal. It has grown limitless! Uncle, when did you reach? She's Seetha, Marudhu sir's only daughter. - Hi - Who is she uncle? She is our advocate, Mellina. She has come to see our land. Look, all the lands in the vicinity are ours. People of all 10 towns around work in our land. We give them a good pay. Saravana, offer them tender coconut. The entire vicinity in either extents is ours. So the case is on the land you just showed me? No the case is on our motherland. Motherland? Which one is that? The place where we are standing. This one? Such a small area? Why do you take it so casually? They got there before us? Oh lord! The land we saw, is that the one in dispute? No. The place where we are standing now is the one. Such a small area? This is our motherland. They are fighting with us claiming this land to be theirs. - This is my ancestral property. I won't give it away. - The same applies to me. Look at him lying without any hesitation. What are you looking at? Look at the Madras girl. Looking gorgeous. I should somehow make her fall for me. She is for me. I need to make her love me before the festival ends. Help me with that. Take snaps of our land. 80% probability of rain? Seetha, come soon, it's going to rain in some time. - She is talking like an amateur. - It's so bright, can it rain? It'll rain for sure, come. It's summer, dear. We won't get showers. How will it rain in Summer? It's raining like she said. How did you predict the rain? It's raining like she said. Does she have special powers? Of course, I knew this and that's why I brought her with me. The lord is within her. It's raining heavily for the single word she uttered. - How is it raining as per your words? - It's all a power aunty. 'Power' means? A power is an energy. - She can also perform exorcism - Is it? - Ya but not now - Not now, at night. Yeah I do. Sports events set to happen for the Pechi Amman Temple festival... Yeah, go on. Why is it crowded here? - Practice for sports events - Good that you play too. - Do you like sports? - Of course I do. I'll be a lawyer if I wear a coat to the court. I'll be a player if I pad up to the ground! - What game is this? - Get in and see. You'll know. - Advocate - Do you play these games? I inquired. Seems he is a great player. - Go then! - I was talking about games like chess and carom. - Chess? - Those are played on boards boss. This is of that kind too. Paavada, when did you come? - Just came - Why don't you play? - I need to pee. - You'll pee if you get into the game. - We welcome the advocate from Chennai. - Muruga! - Ask him to come too - Murugan, come on to the stage. Excellent game! Aama Kunju, leave me. Are you brainless? Why did you tell him about your playing skills? We'll be knocked out now. Das, do you have any wise idea to escape? I ran away from this town because I had no idea. Why are you asking me? - I got a super idea - No need then. Listen. Why don't we fight each other? Planning to show your valiance? They'll never agree. Bro, will you allow us to fight with each other? Just we two. Boss, seems he'll fight only if they go together. You deaf idiot. I felt like peeing, now I feel like pooing! Get up and enter the ground. - He is getting hit so much? - He is like M.G.R. He'll hit back after getting hit initially. Thrash him on my behalf too! He is getting hit. He will hit back. Good that my face is not dirty! What are you saying? It's your fault and I'm the one with a dirty face! - Get off me! - Paavada fight and save our pride! I'm unable to safeguard myself. How will I keep up the pride of our town? Tell your problem to the lord. Two months ago... She woke up from her sleep.... ... and ran towards the graveyard! When I followed her, I found her hanging upside-down in a tree. The lord has entered her body! Are you trying to chase me out? I won't go. Save her somehow. I won't go. Don't beat me. It's paining. I shall go and never return... She fainted! The lord went off her body. What happened sister? Wake up. Sister, are you all right? Ghost? The lord entered your body and did the magic! Oh lord, Pechi Amma! What is she doing? Not sleepy? Unable to sleep as it's new place. Nope, I see some fear in your face. Fear? In me? I'll, anyway, win this case. My case is so strong. What 'strong'? My case is also strong. I'll also win. You'll also win? How's it possible for the both of us to win? You're stupid? Anyway, don't stand alone at night. Evil powers may pass by. Don't beat it! You're the one I'll beat. Get lost, fool! Hello, who is that? Come out. Seetha, what are you doing here? Nothing, just came. Who is with you? Ask him to come out. Come out. He is Kaatumuthu's son isn't it? What were you doing with him? We're in love with each other sister. What? You know how your parents will react, right? That's what we fear. You should somehow talk to my dad for us. What? I have to talk to him? No chance. Please sister, help us. You're an advocate. In fact they worship you as god. God? If they come to know about this relationship then they'll thrash me too. Get in bro, sit inside. Das, why are you scared? Sir, where are we going to? - You didn't believe what they said - About what? You didn't believe when they said I can finish off ten people at a time. - We're going for that - I didn't get you! He's saying our chapter is closed. I was scratching my leg without knowing there is a sickle underneath. Come. Hold it. Is he targeting the mango? Look near the tree. Will he run that side again? - How was that? - Fair enough. How was that bro? Super sir. Come on, come. Why is he taking us along? Stop! Let them come. Come. Stab these fellows first. He ran away leaving us. Do you believe at least now? Yes I believe. Why did you stab them? They got my relatives married to each other. Shouldn't you kill the couple, then? They helped them get married. Isn't it their fault? You're right. Will you keep quiet? Isn't one sickle enough to pose? Why do you show off with so many sickles? - Where are we heading to? - To the temple. What is this? This a 'dough lamp' 'Dough Lamp'? If you make a lamp out of this dough, light it... ... and pray with all your heart... ... when you open your eyes, the lamp will shine on the one you love. Look, didn't I tell you! You're both from here. He has followed you, knowing you'll be here. You and your father are too superstitious. Fine, we are from here. You're not, right? Why don't you try? I don't believe in these things. - Come to the other side of the temple. - OK. I shall be back soon. Come on dear, lets go out for a snack break. I am the Robin Hood of this neighborhood and I shall make you my lady. At the sight of your beauty I have had sleepless nights You have gone mad and I am here to cure your madness. Come on dear, lets go out for a snack break. I am the Robin Hood of the neighborhood and I shall make you my lady. Allow me and I shall cook for you You don't have to flatter me to make me fall for you Jingles from your bangles and anklets fires up my heart Your wish is like that of an ant wanting to swallow a sugarcane. In the open greenery allow this lamb to put off his hunger. Come on dear, lets go out for a snack break. I am the Robin Hood of the neighborhood and I shall make you my lady. Cook the deity's favorite dish and offer, your prayers shall all be answered. All the guys will peep out from their hide out to have a glance at their lady love. A sign with her eyes will light up his life with happiness. Look at you like the monkeys dancing around, to pounce on the orchard full of ripe fruits. Age will never be a bar, the feeling will linger till old age. There is a party out there and everyone will be there to get a look at me. All you have to do is show your real face and the whole village will be scared off. Stop showing of with your big eyes and chill nose, you naughty girl. Come on dear, lets go out for a snack break. I am the Robin Hood of the neighborhood and I shall make you my lady. What do your think about that advocate girl? How is she? What do you mean 'how is she'? Bro, he is asking about her behavior? She is a very good girl. Why do you ask? I've heard the city girls are little out of line. How is that one? Who told you so? City girls will be very outgoing. But if you try taking advantage of that, they'll get outraged. So what about her falling all over you, while dancing today? And she looks at you in a different way. What about that? I'm like her. She was enjoying the festival... ... dancing happily. I think you really don't get her. - Crack it up like that. - That's why you're saying that. So, what to do now? I have to prove she is an innocent girl and not how you people think? Let's test her. I'll go talk to her and slowly grab her hand. I'm sure she will slap me. What if she doesn't slap? - She will, for sure. What if she doesn't slap? If she doesn't, then I'll accept what you guys are suspecting. You guys are going to loose. What are you up to Mellina? Nothing much. I was just enjoying the breeze. Beautiful village, isn't it? Come lets go there and talk. - Let's go. How about sitting here? I've seen such villages only while traveling from Chennai to Trichy. Which is your native place? Kattur, near Trichy Near Trichy? Look at the coincidence. Same village, same profession and same office too. Do you remember our first meet? The first time... Odyssey? Landmark? Yes at Landmark. There too we both purchased the "Kadhalukku Mariyaadhai" movie DVD. From the beginning, we have the same tastes... ... so, ever since then... I had a small... Advocate sir! It went like we predicted, isn't it? We knew it, sir! That's how the city girls are. - Correct. - What are they saying Karthik? Why did you behave like that? - What are you saying? - They claimed you have wrong intentions. Wrong intentions? What do you mean? They said you're attitude is wrong. So? That's why... I... tested you. You tested me? Advocate sir! We knew it! Those city girls are like that. Shut up! What do you know about me? Yes, loose your cool now... You should have done it then. Mellina, please let me explain. Are you human? I came all this way trusting you. You're always with me. You know me well. When they said I was misbehaving... ... you should have defended me. Instead you team up with them and test me? No, I did that to prove them wrong. Why do you need to prove it to them? Who are you to do so? It's wrong to speak ill about girls.... ... and you spoke ill about a girl you know! You... Is this how you test girls in your family? You misunderstood me. I've understood you very well! To think I'm sharing an office space with someone like you... I'm ashamed! Fighting with you disgust me! Your sight disgust me! I can't keep idle. I need to do something... Tea, bro. What, bro? You stay there all depressed... ... while sis is working hard on that case. Looks like she will win the case. What do you mean? Yes. You too start working. I've never seen him go through these books. What book is this? Hey bro, there are no books here. Just cardboard? Put them back. Is there no book? It's only to show off? There are books... but I don't have them. Ravi, who was arrested in the land scam... ... will be killed on his way to the court... ... in a planned encounter. Hello! Get up. Why did you stop the vehicle and push me down? Nothing will work out if you surrender in the court. You escape from here. I won't. You're up to no good. Take me to the court. Aren't they asking you to escape? Don't you want to live? Run. Run I say! Waste two more bullets. Come. Stop there! Stop! Find out who it is. Ravi, who was arrested in the ECR land scam... ... en route to the court... ... got killed in a fake encounter by Inspector Sampath. Now, I am being chased by him for recording the murder. If anything happens to me... Inspector Sampath will be responsible. Manoj, reporter for KM Channel. There he is. Leave me. Why are you hitting me. Where is the DVD? Tell us where the DVD is or prepare to die. I'll talk! I placed the DVD in Kaadhalukku Mariyadhai DVD in this shop What do you want? - Kaadhaluku Mariyadhai. - A girl just bought it. - Who? - Her. Where is she? She took the lift just now. - Can you recognize her? - Yes. Let's go! Come! Mellina I need to talk to you. What are you looking for? Dheena? You're always hiding someone when you talk like this. I was looking for the one in front of whom you plan to embarrass me. You're still angry with me, it seems. Angry? With you? It wasn't my fault. It was because of them. So? I came to apologize. What? You came to apologize? Then why did you sneak here like a thief? - Like a thief? - Yes. You came to steal the arguments I've prepared for the case. And since I caught you? You lie that you came to apologize? Dheena! Where were you? You didn't lock the office and let unwanted people enter! Really? I locked the door properly. Bro, can you please move? Hey, here he is. Oh! You were talking about him! I was thinking something else... Enough! You're going overboard. Bro, why do you want to steal her arguments? He's afraid of losing the case. That's why he wanted to steal them. I can win this case without stealing your arguments. You're going to win? A bad student won't win against a meritorious one! This is your first and last case. I'll make you quit this job and leave the town. We'll see which one of us will be running away! Super, sis! Let's see! Extremely delighted! Greetings. Welcome Assistant Commissioner. He's an inspector, right? That will soon change. That's why I'm practicing. It doesn't look like it! What do you mean? I'm not the one saying it. It's all over the news. What is it? It seems you didn't know about it? What does he know? He's here to collect his bribes as usual! What about the evidence DVD? Did you forget the DVD? What about that DVD matter? I can't get directly involved, so I've informed Kasimedu Antony. She escaped once and now she is not in town. Why do give excuses like a woman? Can't you do your work properly? These useless guys are questioning me... Why do you lose your temper? If anything goes wrong... We have people to surrender on our behalf. But what about you? You have no one. So far you've done 14 encounters. 12 of them were murders. 13 with this one. If the DVD is out, you can't stay in the department. What? You're threatening me? No one can stop me from becoming Assistant Commissioner. Bribing me doesn't mean you can take me for granted. I'm a cop and I can change my actions accordingly. So stop playing your mind games. Isn't it me who is at risk? I know how to deal with this. You guys can... ... mind your own business. The cop is showing off! You can't get the evidence from a woman and you talk like a ** big shot! What's this? Your sis is walking to the office? Really? I didn't know. Why are you walking? What happened to your vehicle? On my way back from the court it broke down. I left it at the workshop and took the bus. I'm very tired. - Go get me a coffee, please. - OK, sis. Dheena. Yes, brother? Get me a tea. How about putting a stove in the office? We can prepare tea and coffee and save money. No need. The smoke will blacken the walls. It'll give a bad impression to my clients. Wait for a few days. Then the office will be ours. Not just a stove, we'll convert his room into a kitchen. Or we'll put a bed there for you to live here. Yes, wash and dry your clothes in my room. Why are you getting upset? The hearing is in a couple of days. No matter what you do, I'm going to win. You'll be free to go then. Or you can become Dheena's assistant? He doesn't know how to make coffee! Don't take her side... Let the hearing come in 2 days... Even I know the law. What do you know about the law? As per rental agreements... ... a nuisance complaint should be filed... ... to vacate a tenant from a room or an office. US sections 101... 105... ...and 173. That's the procedure. That's the only sections he knows. These laws have been changed. Generally people fail at answering. But you failed at questioning! They changed? When? I studied them. It's been 5 years that... OK enough. Do you think I have time to talk? I have to work on the case. - You're picking me up at the station? - How many times will you remind me? The Howrah express, right? Wait for me, I'll come. OK, dear. - Tell me. - Advocate General Mr. Ragasurya... Author of 'Transfer of properties'. Probably a wrong guess.... Do you know him? I'm going to meet him. He gave me an appointment. Today. Why am I wasting my time with you? Let me confirm the appointment. Mr. Ragasurya? Karthik here. Isn't he overacting? Why is he calling me? I am at your office. Why are you calling me? I was expecting you. We got the appointment. Where are Mr. Ragasurya pointers? Ragasurya? - In the office... - Very good. Thank you. Do not open it. Why do you need that? Keep quiet. This point is enough. Everything is crystal clear. In 2 days, the whole court will laugh at those who mocked us. Wait here, I'll put the file in the locker. Come on, let's go have a tea. Please make it quick. - What's happening here? - Nothing. You can go, there is no work for now. OK. I'll order your coffee and leave. Wasn't it a blue color file? I wonder where he put it? He came back? Is there a spare key here? Fraud! Astrology file? You fraud! Why is she calling now? Dude, something smells fishy! Mellina speaking. You sound low. - Speak louder. - Mellina speaking! Mellina? What is it? Can you come to the office? Why now? My dad is coming from native. You want me to empty my room for him? No... if you don't come I can't leave. How are these related? I'm in your room. What? You are in my room? Look... if any evidence goes missing, you're a goner. What a joke! How dare you mock me? Karthik... I don't have time to fight. My father is at the station. I have to go pick him up. - Come and open the door. - Then accept your mistake. - Impossible. - Then I'm hanging up. OK... I've committed a mistake. - Then apologize. - I won't. Then I won't come either. Cut the call. Fine. Sorry. Even if you apologies, a mistake is a mistake. The law is same for everyone. And as a punishment, you'll stay in that room all night. And now the power is out! Sir... Hello... Are you out of your mind? Dad! How did you come? If you were busy at work... I could have taken your address and come by rickshaw. Why trouble him? That's not a problem, sir. - Come dear, let's go home. - OK, dad. But my vehicle is at the workshop. I know, dear. Isn't that why you sent him to pick me? Give me a minute. I've to lock my room and the office. - There are lot of thieves around here.... - Come dad, let's go. Auto. None of them are stopping. All the rickshaws are full. And the empty ones won't stop.... At the station... He came straight to me. 'You're Mellina's father, right?' He asked that and took me with him. I wonder how he recognized me! How did he find out? Sir, are you Mellina's dad? - Yes. We're finally home! - I'm going. - Come have a cup of coffee. Tell him! Let him leave. It's really late. You're right, it's getting late. If not today, one day you have to come. OK? Thank him, dear. If I thank him, he'll go overboard. Stubborn girl, she won't thank me. By now, you would've gotten drunk and passed out. I gave up my beer for her! Hurry up and go! Thank you. Among the millions of women in the world, I loved you My life has totally changed since the moment I saw you Among the millions of men in the world, I found you And I want to eternally be with you Among the millions of women in the world, I loved you My life has totally changed since the moment I saw you I am the beast and you are my beauty Together we shall make true love Our lives are destined to be together Our hearts understands the love for each other The beauty that the world has not seen I am excited to see in you The intricacies that no one has uttered ever I am amazed to hear from you Every moment with you feels fresh In the middle of my deserted life You are the freshness of a blossoming flower Through every feature of your body, I've glanced true beauty My love breaks the shield in your heart To live a life at peace My life is resting on yours Like the rainbow resting on the skies Among the millions of women in the world, I love you My life has totally changed since the moment I saw you Among the millions of women in the world, I love you My life has totally changed since the moment I saw you Among the millions of men in the world, I found you And I want to eternally be with you What are you watching? - A debate show. - Like I don't know what you were watching! Adult stuff right? - Why do you ask, then? - I'll beat you! - Welcome, bro! - It's time to get high. Have you ever fallen in love? What sort of question is that? I sincerely loved 15 girls. Why did you spit? I said 'love'. What do you think I was talking about? If the girl you love... ... loves you back, that's it. Understood? What if she doesn't? Right from Bindu to Joyce to Sowmya... None of them responded to my love! And once I started counting them... ... it added up to 15. I was proud but heartbroken at the same time. What did I do wrong? It's not your fault... Asking you that question was my mistake. Among those 15 girls... Did you at least love one sincerely? I loved all 15 of them sincerely. What do you know about love? You don't even know how to behave with the girl next to you. What do you know? Get lost! What are you saying? Do you know? How much I love Mellina? What? Before coming to this office, I met her. I fell for her when I saw her at Landmark. That "Kadhalukku Mariyaadhai" DVD is the symbol of my love. Get that DVD and play it. Since she didn't tell me she was a lawyer, I fought with her out of ego. Now I can't talk to her normally... How can I tell her? Don't worry. I am well known for uniting lovers. How? It doesn't look like "Kadhalluku Mariyaadai". Seems like some cop story. So I help the lovers elope. Then they return with a kid. Problem solved. I wonder what she's doing now? Who is that? She's calling. Karthik come to my house immediately. - What did she say? - She asked me to come. She seems to be faster. Take Selvam with you. I'll take charge here. Why should I go along? He snatched that bottle too... Yes Sethji, the house you asked for is ready. You proceed. Come in. - Tell me what is it? No, come in. Why is she calling me inside? What are you guys doing here? How did you come? They are in love and have eloped. - You must help us. Yes, we have to do something. - What do you mean by 'we'? Are you out of your mind? They are kids but you're an adult. Aren't you mature enough? Don't you know about their fathers? Violent people! They will butcher us. Send them back home. - Please, leave. - What do you mean? They love each other sincerely. They are threatening to suicide if they can't be together. How can we send them back? So, we should die? - You chicken! How can you break their trust? She's Jansi Rani. Go along with her, she will help you guys. If you're afraid, shut up. I'll take care. Where is Das? There he is, the brave heart. Go. He'll die for your love. I just said that earlier for fun but you got serious! Come Das. They love each other. They eloped, trusting us. We need to help them. Yes, uncle. we love each other. Help us. Don't be afraid, Das. We'll talk to their fathers. Are you nuts? You can't talk to them, they will bash us up! There comes Kaatamuthu! He is going to kill us. Who is he dear? Why is he crying? What are you doing here at this hour? Dad, this is Das. He was the one who got us the office space. And them? This is Seetha. Das' sister. This is Saravanan. They love each other. Their families are opposed to it, so they eloped. Das is crying, thinking how to unite them. Isn't it? Look at the love he has for his sister. Yes dad, their fathers are very cruel. - What are you saying? Those who don't respect love aren't humans at all! You guys have come to the right place. Karthik and my daughter are the saviors of the law. They will definitely help you. - Right, son? - Yes, sir. Das, don't worry about anything. I am here. - I'll sacrifice myself to unite them. - Get lost! You won't share a beer and you say you'll sacrifice your life? Don't worry. No one can separate you. First, we'll arrange a register marriage. With your brother's blessing. Sir! If I bless them, I'll loose my head! Is he nut? OK. The girl will stay here. Send the boy with him. We'll discuss the rest in the morning. OK dad. I'm tired. I'll go back to sleep. Look at what your girl's father did to us in his sleep! Look at these lovers!! Idiots! Why is he here? Do you know him? I had a problem with him on the road. I'm feeling very scared. When you think of Kaatamuthu? When I think of you. Me? Why? I know what they'll do with me. But I have no idea when, where and what they'll do to you! At this hour, why did she call for him? She may have seen what's on the DVD. My heartbeat is rising! Don't worry. Believe in me. I definitely can't. Karunakaran... Before they find out and get into action... We should do something. Kaatamuthu. Why is he calling? Did he find out? Put it on speaker and talk. If we want to save ourselves.... They have to die. Sir, both of them are advocates. What if they are advocates? I'm a policeman! They're not from here. If we kill them... Who will inquire? I'm here. Don't worry about a thing. - We'll take care of that Panchayat. - OK, sir. - Be there at 10. - OK. Look at him, fixing up my death! It's 9:50 and no one's here. Where are they? Why do you look so tensed? I'm going to argue for the first time, so I'm tensed. You're the only one. Look at him. He's relaxed. He may have argued in many cases already. Who? Him? He can't even spell 'court'. He got his degree after several attempts. He is used to loosing. Are they laughing at me? Give me the paper where I noted the important points. Give it. Looks like he has gathered lots of points. Keep quiet. There's no argument in there. It's just en empty sheet. Point no.1, point no.2 , point no.3... Super! I don't think we will win. Greetings. Sir is in the car. From today morning his time has been bad. He request to postpone the hearing to tomorrow. It's impossible. The hearing is today. Is it? Let me check with him. Sir, it seems it can't be postponed. OK sir. If he has to come for the hearing, then you'll have to wear this. What is this? Black color is not something he likes. So you should remove the black coat and wear this for the hearing. I should wear this to argue? Wearing that cloth is against the rules. I have to wear that black coat. Then, wear this. What's that? Lay all your trust on the bindi in her forehead. Come on everybody. Lets go in. Hail Kaatamuthu, who is in Chennai for the hearing. Hail Kaatamuthu. How are you? I'm fine. What about you? I am fine. Why did you bring so many people to the court. What are you saying? If the panchayat turns to violence, we'll have to save the boss. We'll give bail and you'll get out. They'll ask us to get out? Who are they to throw us out? - They won't ask, just let you go. - Meaning? They'll postpone the hearing. So why get into a fight? Put the weapons back in the vehicle. Let's start then. Let's go. Everything will be fine. Don't worry. Kaatamuthu. - I can't read and write. - Place your hand. Place my hand? I will speak only the truth and nothing apart form the truth. Don't you trust me? I am a man of my word! Come to my hometown and inquire. Didn't you tell them about me? It's just a formality, sir. Move on. Marudhu There he goes again. - He has fallen asleep? - Your honor... ... as far as this case goes... - Sit down, please. - Why did he interrupt? - Look at him, posing like a beggar. Please do something. One moment. This is going to take a while. I'm helpless! Dear God! Sir, my name is Marudhu. He already called your name out thrice. Tell me the matter. OK. Sir, his forefather's forefather and their forefather's forefather's and their forefather's grandfather's wife's child is my forefather. And I request you to tell him that the land owned by them belongs to this Marudhu. No, my forefather's forefather and their forefather's forefather's forefather's forefather and their forefather's forefather's daughter's first husband is my forefather. Tell him that we are entitled to that land. When the lawyer eats a chilly will the judge have a dessert? Dogs are jobless and they don't have time to spare! Are you brothers? We are in-laws! How? His forefather's forefather and their forefather's forefather's son and... My forefather's forefather and their forefather's forefather's daughter were married. So he is my in law. I swear. Please wait. He is tired so soon? Tell me. We are the oldest lineage. How? - My forefather's father's... - Stop it. Tell me the matter. My forefather's father's wife had 5 husbands. My forefather was born to the first husband. His forefather was born to the fifth husband. So am I not the eldest lineage? Shouldn't the land belong to me? His forefather may be the son to the first husband, but my father is the first son of the fifth husband. In that case, am I not the eldest in lineage? -How can one know which child was born to which father? - Is there any proof for that? There is, your honor! The oldest granny of that town, Veeramma can stand witness. - Who is that Veeramma? - She's the oldest granny in our village. - I thought she was dead. - She has defied death seven times. What is she doing? Why didn't you tell me earlier? Will we lose? Let's see what the witness says. Tell me granny. Isn't Marudhu's lineage the eldest in your village? Tell them clearly that the rightful owner of that land is Marudhu. Looks like she is rearing pigeons. Ms. Mellina, what is the granny saying? She says that Marudhu's lineage is the eldest. Objection, your honor. They are trying to deceive us by bringing a dumb granny. Since the granny is not in her senses, we cannot consider her as a witness. No, your honor. This granny is the oldest in the village and hence knows about the lineage. It can very well be confirmed that my petitioner is the eldest considering her witness. We cannot consider her as the prime witness. I can also bring such witnesses for which I request some time. First I need to get rid of this case. I am scheduling the hearing of this case to the 23rd of this month. The court is adjourned. Who ever thought that this granny would be making dog voices! That's why they postponed the hearing. I should give her a handful of chilly... and feed her so that she will start speaking! And there was a man to bring her like a sacred deity. We should drown her in the river. We still have a week's time. You can visit your native and come back. We are going to go sightseeing for a week, finish the case and return to our village. - Which way should we take to the sea? - The sea? Take any way and go. Shall I ask a few henchmen to kill that granny? She will die on her way to the village. Why do you want 10 men for that? Take 8 men along with you! It will be a murder case. We will take care of that. What bother's you? OK. Go back to your native. Please be back on the 23rd. Go back? We didn't go sightseeing the last time we came and all the boys were upset about that! We'll go sightseeing, finish the case and then go back to the village. Until then? We'll stay in Chennai. Why is she calling me? Hello. It's Seetha and Saravanan love anniversary and she wants to buy some clothes. Seetha wants to go out. Both of you can go out forever. Are you nuts? If Kaatamuthu sees us... ... he will chop us. Don't you know that? Ask her to stay home. I'll come and discuss. He said not to go out anywhere. He scolded me. - Please sister. Just this one time. - No. - No Seetha. - Please sister. You can do it. Fine we'll go out. But Karthik mustn't know this. Why is it whistling at us? What are you searching for? How dare you! It's Kaatamuthu! Wait, I'll be back. What are you doing? What's the problem? He has some weapon with him. Let your weapons with them. Take them back on your way out. No problem. Please give them and come. What are you doing here? We need to buy a vessel for the Panchayat and some clothes for Saravanan. Is it? You carry on with your work. I have a meeting with a client. Call me if you need any help. You please carry on with your work. Why do you keep talking to a noseless guy? Oh my God! Look here. Oh my God! Why do you shout in my ears? What is this? Please check them. This is an escalator. This will take you upstairs if you stand carefully, if not it will take you to the heavenly abode. You don't use these stairs. It will be damaged if you use and we might have to compensate for that! You use the normal stairs. Don't leave me and go. - My dhoti! - Your gown is covering you up, don't worry. I go up even when I get down! - You can see the skies from inside? - Yes! My dhoti! I can't find it! Follow them. Go inside the street. It's a narrow street. We can't go inside. Tell me, Karunakaran. We lost the girl. - What? - We were following her but she went through a narrow street and... Hang up. Bro! Isn't that Mellina sister? Yes... Hey, Mellina! She came without informing me. Why is he calling now? She cut me off! The trial room is there. You cannot change here. Please sir. Who are you? How dare you come into my room? You bloody nonsense. Stop there! Are you behaving according to your age? See what my husband is going to do to you! Raju. Put clothes on that dummy. Hey, Mellina. Oh my god! He is here! We'll get a mobile first. There she goes. Come let's go there fast. This is the roof of Chennai. He is the husband of that lady. All jobless people will be roaming here. It's not only that... We came the wrong way. Let's go that way. You only brought us this side. But a talking doll is present over there. Did you notice? A talking doll? Look at the marvels happening in a city. Excuse me. Uncle can you please move? - This is how you open it. - Oh it's like that! These guys are staring at me! Just joking! These stupid guys stand and urinate! This tribal does not even know how to open the door. You want to kill me? Why did you bring them out? Do you have any sense? It didn't do it. It's all Mellina's work. She cut my call. I'm looking for her! There they are. When will the door open? He's standing like a 7 feet statue. How dare you! - Uncle! - Run now! What is the problem? Nothing. - How dare you place your hands on me? - I don't care. He's my lawyer. I'll thrash your face. Get lost. He was the one who pushed first. You leave. How dare you stare at us? - Are you coming along? - Yes. Thank god I didn't get angry. Go that side. Somewhere here I saw a shirt for Saravanan. That one may be... It is this shop. Come let's go inside. Sir is coming inside. Be careful. - Uncle? - Hi. What are you doing here? My friend is getting married. Came along with her. - You know your father is here? - Yes. I informed him. Good that you informed. She's my relative. I was the one who named her. Can you check if that shirt will suit Saravanan? No. That will not suit him. - She knows it well. - You know the shirt size, do you? - What happened? - Nothing, uncle. - You carry on. - OK, uncle. Looks like nothing will suit here. Let's look for another shop. - Do you have any sense? - It's not her fault. How many times do I have to tell you not to take them out? What is the issue now? Why are you overreacting? What are you doing? The house next door has cable TV, the opposite one and the one upstairs as well. Do you have it? - Why have you started to advertise, mom? - This is the only work I haven't done so far. Have you come alone? What about dad? So you'll allow only if dad comes along? Take your hand off. - Why have you come? - Why are you so harsh? - I've come to attend Kanchana's marriage. - Kanchana? Nothing to wonder. Kanchana, our neighbor. The bridegroom belongs to Chennai. I'm here to attend her marriage. Get back home in the evening. We need to meet an important person. Important person? - Who do you know in Chennai? - Is there no one I know here? Don't keep on talking. Go and get ready. - Why have you brought me here mom? - Let me get down. Do you know whose house it is? Why is he continuously talking? Why are you getting in? Sister, Karthik and his mom have come. Dad told me to visit this place before returning. Pay for the auto. - You never told me! - Come, get in. Come, be seated. - Is everyone doing well at home? - Yeah all are fine. I've come here to attend a wedding. Thought of visiting your home before returning. Only after you told me over the phone, I came to know he's the one the principal recommended. He never told anything to us. - I came to know through his friend Selvam - What can we do? Thought both will share good wavelengths, being advocates. But that itself is a trouble. I've never seen your daughter. Is she at home? Can you call her? Mellina, serve coffee to them. Okay, dad. I'm Karthik's mom. Take it. Take. I knew it. Though I didn't see her before, the girl I fixed for you had to be beautiful! He is so ignorant! Even during college days, to write a paper... - How do you call that again? - What mom? Five or six times? Yeah, you call it 'attempt'. How many times? Six? - Three, mom! - Saying that in a low voice! He somehow cleared it after 3 attempts. What's wrong with him? You should feel lucky to have such a son, gem! - So intelligent! - Who? Him? - Let's move. - Happy that you visited our home. Don't feel bad. It's my daughter's life. I can't help it if she doesn't like him. Sir, we shouldn't force. My dad says this often... For humans, birth, death and marriage... ...all three are prewritten by the almighty even before we're born. We can never predict it. Let it happen as per fate. Are you looking for alliances elsewhere? A family is expected to visit us next week. Your daughter will fit in a beautiful family. May I leave? I'm leaving Mellina. Everything will go on well. See you. What else? Move. Nice family, isn't it? Things will happen as per fate. No use in worrying. Karthik, it's getting late. Eat and sleep. Smile dear. I'm leaving. Make a move. I cherish your presence everyday. Yet I feel like losing you. My heart is filled with love for you Yet, I am speechless to express. I express myself to you all day long. Yet I forget my presence The world without you, is a world of darkness. I cherish your presence everyday. Yet I feel like losing you. My heart is filled with love for you Yet, I am speechless to express. You are rooted in my heart. Like a ship anchored to the shore. Even your tears create the beauty of colors Like the sun rays hitting raindrops This journey of my life... is at stake because of my love for you. You make me wait eternally just to feel your magical presence I want to thrash him. Be patient. Let's get permission from the lord. Ask the lord to make it fast. Dheena, what happened? They came to know about the love matter. Das got caught. You escape. Oh lord! Mellina, come here. - We'll go to the theater and the beach. - If Mellina sees us, we'll be in trouble. So beautiful! What happened? Get up. How dare you capture girls? Give the phone. Give that phone. I'll knock you down. I am a goner! I am dead! Please say the truth and save me from these people unlike that cheater! He is Paavada, isn't it? - Don't you know? - Why are you beating him? I'm Saravanan. This is my wife, Seetha. We purchased a new home from Haridas Real Estate the very next day of our marriage. In just one year, we got a beautiful baby girl. My husband got placed in a reputed firm too. They're so lucky builders! Best place to purchase plot or home is Haridas Real Estate. Haridas, a bypass for new homes. I guarantee you all! What are you looking there? You come here. Can't you behave properly in a public bus? Trying to show heroism? - Are you lovers? - Yes, sir. I would have set them ablaze when I saw them in the theater. But since they're not married yet, I'll take him to town and set him ablaze. Don't you feel pity on me? They claim that I've hidden Saravanan and Seetha in Chennai. We did it all three together. Don't you know? Ask him to say whether he knows. I'll say then. - Don't you know? - Nope. I don't know either. Like my granny said, no advocate speaks the truth! Catch him. Mr. Karthik, didn't we drink together that day? Didn't I tell about lovers? Didn't you spit on me for it? Didn't she call then? - Didn't we go? - You confessed that you didn't. Saravanan and Seetha were present at your home when I visited. Weren't they? - He himself agrees they weren't there. - Go ahead, beat him. Be quiet. Allow me to talk. Didn't you take them to the mall even when I stopped you? Didn't you get them mobile phones as you got an offer? Didn't you? Didn't we roam around the mall to save them both? Oh my lord, won't I get justice? Stop that! She is the one. This is the dress Seetha was wearing in the textile shop, isn't it? If you lie... ... I won't like it. Tell the truth. I said tell the truth! Sir... We had your children in our homes. I already told. You didn't believe. You made us swear to speak the truth? Is that only for us? Don't I treat you like my own daughter? How could you betray me? Why are you standing here? Let's move. Just a minute. They somehow fell in love with each other. We were hiding it as we didn't want to spoil your reputation... More than my mother, I treated you like my lord! But you almost killed me by marrying off my girl into that family. - Where is my daughter? - She is safe in my home. Give the phone. Give. You take out your phone too. She is not picking. This is the cause for all troubles. Leave that. She is at your home, isn't it? Let me leave her in my home and then see to the case. Why is he staring again? Go! Where is my daughter? Why are you blinking? They must be roaming somewhere. Wonder who's going to get caught? Boss, the girl is missing too. The girl and guy you're looking for are with me. Someone kidnapped them and is threatening me. - Threatening? I don't need them. I need you. Who are you? That's not important. I need you. Else, you can't see them alive. - Velu. - Sir? Go... Am I Lord Ganesha? You inane idiot! Come to the old building near Ambatur railway station. Things are mysterious! Are you in trouble? Is anyone following you? Has anyone spoke to you this way before? Nothing of that sort. Is that important? What bothers me? I'm leaving. I can save them only if I go. - Why did he leave me alone? - He is going in too. They'll be in trouble if I don't go. - Don't talk nonsense. He told you he wants you. What if he does something to you? - Then? I just leave it like that? What if it affects them? - I'm going! - Both are fighting here? Why did you leave me alone? I'm scared. What's happening? You go. Selvam and I will follow you. We'll stand at a distance. Talk loudly. We need to know what's happening. Das, come here. Make sure not to disclose these to anyone. Don't say it out. - I just came in. What do I know? - You know everything, bye. Friendship with you and the devil is no different! Why is he blinking? Coming here? Seem there is a problem. Our children have been kidnapped. They want the girl in exchange for our children. - Paavada is aware of everything. - He is coming. All are looking at me. What did you discuss there? You already tore my shirt. What's left to tear? Get me a new one, I'll tell! Who are you? Why have you kidnapped them? Leave them. Don't you know me? Dude, I've seen him earlier. Don't you know anything about the content of the 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD you have? What's in it? Pretending as if you don't know? Why should I? It has no evidence. It just has the movie. I've seen it. I've seen him in the 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD at our home. Why can't the evidence be in Karthik's DVD copy? What are you saying? Karthik has the same 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD. Why did she pull you in? Call and ask him to bring the DVD here. I'll leave them. - OK. Boss, all are here. I'll shoot if you come near. Get them into the vehicle. Sir, stop! - What, bro? - Why did you interfere? We would've saved your children. Why did you come? We're not heartless to risk the life of Mellina to get back our children. It would have been OK if you didn't come. You ruined it! Bro, we'll obey you. We need our children. Tell us. - Firstly, we need to protect the DVD. - OK. They'll search for the evidence. We need to go before them. OK? You needn't come. Selvam, follow me. In case of any trouble, please don't call me. I can't help. Get lost. - Shall we hand over the DVD and get them back? - No. Why? They'll leave if we hand over this. No he won't. He killed the reporter who saw his encounter. How will he leave us? So what do we do? We make a copy. Coffee? But there's no milk. Wait. - Sis, can you lend some milk? - This has become a habit. You never return anything. Is this the one? No one should escape. Dude, coffee. How many copies did you make? Only one, sir. I didn't know so many of you were coming. Dude, run away. Sir, he made a copy of the DVD. I have it. And the original? He ran away with it. Why did you leave me alone dude? I had to struggle a lot to escape. Hey get up. Wait, let me catch my breath. What? - Turn - What for? - That's the original DVD - Of which film? - That's the police encounter DVD - What to do now? Where are Kaatamuthu and Marudhu? - Ask him what to do next. - Wait, he'll say. Got a call. Trying to play your advocate tricks with me? You have to get me the original DVD to Binny Mill in the next half an hour. If you come with the gang and create chaos, you won't even see the children. - Hello? - What? Was it him? - Yes, sir. - What did he say? He'll leave them or not? He is saying we can't see the children unless we give the DVD Ask him whether he'll be fine with any random movie DVD. What to do now? Idea! Your idea? Oh god! We got no idea about the position while entering. You need to adjust according to the position. You need to act smart, not just fast. Das, operation starts now. I should somehow save the advocate girl. How to enter? Sir, this is not the intended DVD. Where is my 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD? Is 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' yours? I thought it was Vijay's? - This is the one. - Don't make me tense. Give that DVD. Where is the copy you made? - My copy is in the computer. - I brought it sir. I left it(coffee) on the computer table. I didn't notice that - Bring that copy. - OK, sir. It would have gone cold by now! Tie them both. Move it now - Yes, I like to move it! Move it! - Shut up. I said to move the roof! - Who should get in first? - Annachi, get in first. I'll be the last. - He'll come forward only for eating. - Shall I go first? Where is the original DVD that you took away? - Where is it? - It's with Azhagu. Untie him. Call him and ask him to bring the DVD. - Hello? - Azhagu? Take the 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai' DVD and come here soon. He wants Azhagu to come. Azhagu! Azhagu? Don't try to gain good name everywhere. Go! Asking permission from the lord even for this? Jump. You said he's Azhagu? - Who named you? - My dad. Your dad named you bad! Check it. This again is not ours. - Playing the fool with me? - Advocate sir! Mani, bring the original DVD of 'Kadhaluku Mariadhai'. Wants me to send Mani. It's you, go. The DVD is here. Don't worry. You can go back to home. Have it, the original DVD that you asked. Bought it for Rs 200. Watch it and leave them. I won't harm you. Okay? Check it. This again is not ours. Samayapuram lord, Maari Amman! Sir, I'm diabetic. I'll sit wherever you want me to. I urinate frequently. Don't tie my hands. How will I urinate from here? I'll get the DVD here! - Bring them here. - Give me one last chance, please. You'll get the original DVD. Don't harm them, please. - Ya? - Hello, Das. Bring the DVD here. - Tell him to bring the original encounter DVD. Bring the original encounter DVD. - OK fine. Give that. Trace the location of the phone number. Before going, let me go to the restroom. He made all the calls to the same number! Check whose number it is. Inspector... The encounter DVD which you've been waiting for. This must be useful for you. Diwali got over long ago. Why do you still have the gun? Why are you looking at this? Pray as always. An early sign from the lord today? Things are set to end well today. Hold it properly. - Yeah, I am! Go! As Annnachi said, everything is lined up! Oh my dear, do you know, you're my dream love? Hold it well. Can it bear my weight? You promised to give 4 sovereign gold for my daughter's marriage. You're asking everything to me instead of him? Wait I am coming. Take him away! I don't feel any weight. He hasn't gone yet? Where are they? No one is to be found! They're here. I'm coming. They hit me. The one in red dress. He will finish you with a single strike. Tie me. He entered so boldly? Now he's asking to be tied up? He only knows to yell. The last wicket is duck out too! What bro? If you're being so free after tying all our hands... ...you must have an intelligent plan. Did I act smart according to the situation? We messed up all our plans and are trapped. I know how to get the DVD. Bring them here. You feel the pain if I hit her? Love, is it? Don't beat him. Das, catch the encounter DVD. Are you guys playing fools with me? Constables, surround them. Don't let any accused escape. - We're arresting you. - Don't you know who I am? I know. Come out and see. Your film is going viral. Pirated VCDs of your fake encounter have been released. The commissioner ordered your arrest. The coffee you asked for. This is the coffee I was talking about. Hope you know who I am. Next Assistant Commissioner. Look dear... We do not want any relation with these people. We shall get back to our town. Just a minute, sir. Whether to get them married and feel happy... ... or separate them and shed tears on their death... ... depends on you. They may even die together, but won't live apart. Go, come back with my daughter-in-law. I'll see to the consequences. Look dear... If you've really decided to marry that guy, I won't stop you. But tell him one thing... ... I will never give my land like I give my daughter! I may give my daughter, but not my land! My advocate will take care of that! You sought the advocate for your disputes, but where will he go for his troubles? What's it? Tell me, I'll handle. It's the advocate lady's fault! Our advocate fell in love before finding the case. He first saw Mellina in a gift shop. Love at first sight. I made them share a house, unaware of that. They had fights and ego clashes. He has been suffering without being able to propose his love. Son, tell me now. Are you in love with her? What's her opinion? Advocate lady, do you love him? Say something. What if you remain silent? You would be lucky to get such a guy. This won't work out. I'll look for an alliance. I know people in Madurai, Trichy, Coimbatore... Say yes. I'll take care. Yes... Come again? Say it again? If he is fine with it... ... I'm also OK. - Son, tell me. - Mellina agreed. What do you say? If she is fine with it, I'm also OK. What's next? Bring them both together. The coin has been tossed.
