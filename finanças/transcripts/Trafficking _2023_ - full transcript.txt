- All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. All I ask is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. Is that enough? - Yeah. - Can I keep this 'cause this is written by Richard. I can frame this couldn't I? - Yeah, that's how it will all begin. Hello princess. - I must go down to the seas again, for the call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied. And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying and the flung spray and the blown spoon and the seagulls. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. - Doctor Gelmini. - I'm sorry to have kept you Mr erm... - It's fine, it's fine. - Of course. Did you come on your own today? Someone with you, a friend or relative perhaps? - Listen, I have somewhere to be so if we can just get on with it please. - All right then, there's no easy way of saying this. It is as Dr. Bloom and I first feared, it's a grade four glioblastoma. - A tumor. That's what Dr. Bloom says was incurable, right? Well the survival rate is only 4% but some patients can live up to five years. - Some patients. - Yes. Although your tumor is much more advanced than that. - How long? - If only you'd have visited us sooner, all those missed appoints, time really was of the essence. - I'm asking you how long, please. - Well, Dr. Bloom still has to review these scans and she'll be in this afternoon... perhaps six months. - Six months, six months. - But please do not despair. I mean there are lots of treatments out there available from surgery to radiation to chemotherapy. In America they've even had very good success with the immunotherapy, stem and gene therapy. So the problem is. - Mate, mate, mate, you're in a world of the other The old quack have to say. - He didn't say shit about my liver. So cheers to that. - Well I'll fucking drink to that, cheers. Everything else right though yeah? - Sound as a pound John, yeah. - Thank fuck for that. You had me worried there. - Don't do that. - Don't do what? - Don't fucking go wasting it on me Johnny. - Don't know what you're talking about. - You're fucking pitying me Johnny. Don't go fucking pitying me, you hear me? - No mate, I wasn't. I was saying I was worried about you 'cause we mate aren't we? I didn't say that I pitied you, besides, everything's all right, isn't it? We're celebrating. - All right. - Johnny, same again? - Yes please darling. - Sure, do you want me to bring them over. - And deprive me of staring at those two blue, beautiful eyes? - Charmer. - Sorry blud, I didn't see you there. - It's right son. - Who you calling son? - I'm sure it was an accident. - Yeah, that's right, fucking accident. - I'm sorry, can I get two pints please? Fuck me, who you supposed to be Moby? Fucking dick more like, fuck me, what a dump. - Hey, you two aren't gonna be any trouble are you? I just had these floors done and I get off in an hour. - An hour, I can get you off quicker than that if you feel me. - I'm glad to see you've got the right idea. - You what? - Otherwise some cunt and a bigger cunt than you is gonna come cut that tongue right outta your mouth. You kiss your mum with that mouth do you? - What the fuck you say about my mom, prick? You don't mind if we sit here do ya? You fucking deaf or something, here reckon this cunt's deaf. Deaf or ain't got no fucking manners. Don't you know who the fuck we are? What you think if you sit there all strong and silent type that she'll fuck you. Oi, you see her grandad, I better could slip into her pussy hole well easy, you get me, a pint about all she's worth. You get me? You can sniff her from here. - Oy ease up. Geezer could be a war hero or something. We salute you for your service. Just look at ya. You are well and truly blunted. - Fuck me, that's right off. When did you last cleaned the lines? - It's not the lines. Could be the barrel. Raquel, why don't you go and check the barrel? - Well fuck I, he speaks. - Play on maestro. - What you gonna do with that, butter my fucking toast? Say my fucking name. - What? - Say his fucking name. - I don't know your fucking name. Who the fuck are you? - My name is Requiem, Requiem. - Fuck Requiem, fuck does that mean blud? - It means a mass for the dead. You illiterate fuck. - Talking about grooming. Grooming is the process of which offenders, whether it be online or offline. What we're talking about here is the sexual trafficking of children for gain, and these are. - You ready? - Yep. - Do you have your geography book? You have geography today, right, it's Tuesday. - Yeah, of course I do, I'm not stupid. - I'm just checking 'cause you know last week. - I said I've got it. - Eat it quick or you'll be late. - Oh, I'll get it. - No, no. Can you make sure she gets off on time? I'll get it. - Would you stop rushing me? - Hello, hello. - There he is, dead man walking. - But what about the girl? - Chris sent pictures to The Duke. She said the pay top dollar, always do for the pure ones. - How do you know? I mean, not exactly a sket is she? - Daddy's little girl, for now. I can smell that sweet tiny thing from here. - Ah, I thought I heard it in the distance. A little night music, Mass for the Dead. Please, come in. I was just about to put some coffee on. Would you like one? How are you then Requiem, just the same then? - What can I do for you? - Late payer, flash cunt, gone and got himself into all sorts. I don't like the look of the wolves at his door. Dirty things, infested, riddled with mange, no doubt. You know what it's like down there in the muck. Course you do. I want my pound of flesh first. - Who do they work for? - If you're worried, take Johnny. - I'm not worried. - I should think fucking not. You're a retired fucking hitman. - Don't say that fucking word. See what you don't understand is if I were to hitman again, return to the fray as it were, you'd be the first to go in the fucking ground. I deny your life, just that. Then I take everything you fucking have, if I were a hitman. That's why you don't want me to be hitman. No one wants me to be a hitman, not again. 'Cause I couldn't stop if I got started, are we clear? And I'm not gonna start taking hood rats out in the middle of the fucking street. And I'm not going back inside. Not for you, not for no fucker. - Do I look like I give a tinkle toss? I know exactly what you are, we both do. The only thing worse than lying is lying to yourself my son. - There's a lot worse things than lying. - Well fortunately I've got you to sort those things out for me, haven't I? So why don't you fuck off and do them, huh? Oh and Requiem, you know that I know it wasn't what you do. What you did to put you behind those bars. Try and harness that anger. Use it, be lucky Requiem. Thanks hun. - Oh, I'll get it. - No, I'll get it. - It's fine it's probably just Elsie. If it was Elsie she would have had her key, I'll get it. - Sorry, I forgot my key. - That's okay, come on, how was school? - That's Chris, we're on. - Come on then. - Did you get any homework? - Not much. - Elsie. - History and maths. - Elsie. - And geography. - Oh my god, no, no, no. Elsie, run, go to your room right now. - No, she stays here. You all stay here, no one's going fucking nowhere. - Please, please. - Shut the fuck up, cunt. - Please. - Shut up. - Mate. - Get in. - It's gonna be okay darling. Elsie, look at me. Don't be scared, this will be over soon. - Will it? - It's over when we say it's over. Now are you gonna tell her or we gonna go to town on your little girl? - James, please, whatever's going on, just tell them. Just tell them whatever they want to hear. - I'd listen to your bird mate and start fucking talking. - Your husband's in way over his head. - What did you do? - Tell me Anna. It is Anna, isn't it? Sorry, it was just the way we come in here there wasn't no time for any proper introductions. It is Anna, isn't it, Anna? Good, good. So what is it you think your husband does for a job? You know, like the piece of shit. Don't look at him, he ain't fucking talking to you. - Don't think he's got much choice. I think I broke his fucking jaw. - He's a stockbroker. - A stockbroker. Well I suppose him being a stockbroker paid for all his fancy house, didn't it? Do you like your fucking yard do ya? - This is our home. You don't have any right barging in here like this. I mean, who the hell are you guys? You're just thugs, you're animals all of you. - Your fucking home. - What if I told you that your husband borrowed money off our boss. And our boss is the biggest heroin distributor in the whole of Europe. How'd that make you fucking feel, Anna? - Your whole fucking life is a one big fucking lie. A fucking fantasy. - You know what's fucking real? This moment right now is real. We are gonna burn your house down to the fucking ground. How does that make you fucking feel. - Big bad wolves. - And the three little pigs. - Please. - You wanna watch? - Watch what? - Big bad wolf fuck the little piglet before he takes it to market. - Please don't, please don't hurt her, I'm begging you. - Please, please, someone help. - Jade, I'm working. I will be home but it's gonna be late. Just make sure that you do your homework. Have something to eat and go bed early so you're ready for school, all right? All right, love you, bye. Chevonne. - What, looking for something decent drink. Fucking wine. - So fucking drink it then 'Cause we're fucking off in the morning. - For we rise at daybreak! - Going anywhere nice? - Who the fuck are you? - Hope you don't mind, left the front door open. We're looking for James London. - Yo, what fucking the are yous doing to my house? Blood. - We're looking for James London. - Yeah, he's fucking gone. Blood, you get me? - No, he moved on. - So he's gone. - Don't he fucking he speak. - When he has to. This James, how long has he been gone? - I don't fucking know. - So they've gone. - Yeah, they fucked off, they're gone. - And here you are. - Yep, and here we is. - Apologies for disturbing your evening. So you fucking should walking into a man's house all tooled up. You could have had your fucking heads blown off. Don't suppose he left a forwarding address. - Who? - Fucking James. Who the fuck do I look like, Postman Cunting Pat. - Listen, right? He's obviously gone somewhere, you know what I mean? I'll tell you what we'll do, we'll pass on a fucking message to the cunt. Yeah. How about yous two leave us your fucking names and we'll see what we can do. How about that? - Well, who's the fuck do yous work for? - We work for Big Joe. - Who the fuck is Big Joe? - Joe Allen. - Yeah Joe Allen. - Well let's just hope that cunt turns up then. - Yeah, they always do in the end. - Well this has been lovely, but in the most polite as possible way, can I ask you now to off? - Yeah, all right. Once again, apologies for disturbing your evening. One with a big gob is Chris. Bigger gob, Chevonne. The one we saw through the window, Aaron, I know him. He used to run with Danny's crew. He's part of the Mile End gang. He was their Geordie connection. Anyway, he went away for a stretch, came down here and he fell in with these two. And they don't play about, they may look like a pair of fucking cunts who don't know what they're fucking doing. But the person they represent and what they represent. - Smack, fucking scag heads Johnny. - Yeah. - What? - They don't just move fucking brown sugar. They traffic young girls. I'm not going down that fucking rabbit hole. - They had the guy's kid Johnny. - It's not our problem, boss's orders. - How old do you think she'd be, 12, 13? - Yeah, something like that. Look what he owes Joe, ain't worth the trouble. He says he's walked away from more before over far less. Have you lost something? - Have you got any Charlie? - Do you really need it? Here. - Fuck am I gonna do that Johnny. - Look, just do me a favour, yeah, go home straight after, I'll drop you off. - I haven't been home in over 10 years, Johnny. - Here's to past lives lived. - And lost. - Easy mate, we go. Here, let's go. Easy does it. I've got you, I've got you. Easy, easy. - What's up boss? - Everything going to plan? - Yeah, everything's going sweet. - And the girl. - Yeah, perfect. Proper, perfect. Everything's gone sweet, we've done exactly what you said. - To market, to market to buy a fat pig. - Yo, you should see this one boss, proper pert. There's no fat on it at all. It'll take more than a flesh wound to make this one squeal. I'll tell you what, I'm even tempted to make a bid myself for it. - Don't touch what you can't afford Chris. Deflower my rose garden and I will take your life away, make no mistake. Like slipping into a warm bath, you won't feel a thing, I can assure you. Mark her and your card is marked. Do we have an understanding? - Yes, yes. - Excuse me? - Yes boss. - Good. I want you and Aaron to do a drop for me tomorrow. - And what about the girl? - Chevonne can handle her. - Boo. You know he told us not to touch what we can't afford, not to leave a mark. But have you ever seen a pig that isn't branded? - You and Chris better get going. I'll look after her, right. You've gotta be there and back by the afternoon or heads are gonna fucking roll. - You've pissed yourself. You know what you are. You're a dirty little birdie. I'm gonna give you five minutes to clean yourself up and if not, I'm gonna come back and do it myself. - The police social services have let these girls down, without a doubt. These girls brought this up in 2008. - This about yesterday, the kid? Stay out of it. Yesterday, that was good advice, today it's an order. Do you know who these people are, where that girl's heading, Did Johnny tell you who they work for? Well, let me educate you then. Do you know what a heroin baby is? All those Eastern European beggars you see on the high street sitting around in their own filth, they've always got a baby with them. That baby's always asleep. They give them heroin so they stay like that all day and all night. And when they're old enough, and I do mean old enough to walk, they're sold to the highest bidder. Do you know whose idea that was? Do you know who sits right at the top of that fucking tree? The one person in this life that you really don't wanna cross, The Duke. - I can't let them do that, not to this one. Be blind Requiem, don't be brave. You're a debt collector. Not fucking Unicef. She's a child. It's not as if she's a giant whale or a fucking panda, is it? There's always plenty of children to go around. She'll be sucking fresh cock this time next week. Are you familiar with the story about the snake and the fish, folklore of Armenian descent as told to me by my very dear friend Kevork. Snake in a fish become friends. Snake says to fish, will take me swimming on your back? Well they're friends so the fish says, yeah, of course. So the snake gets on the fish's back and shows him all around the seas and takes him swimming and all of a sudden, for no reason at all, the snake bites the fish. "What did you do that for?" He said the fish and the snake said, "It's in my nature. It's a characteristic." Said the snake. And with that the fish said, "I've also got characteristics, funnily enough." And with his dying breath, it dives into the murky depths of the ocean and drowns the snake. - What's your point? - I can see it in your eyes, no matter what I say, you've already made your mind up. It's in your nature. You think she'll thank you for it. Do you think she'll say, oh Requiem, my hero. Do you think it'll atone for your sins? - I've served my time. - Yes indeed you did. A junkie cunt found in his mum's floor with a needle in his arm covered in his own shit and piss, nasty business. Manslaughter though, you're welcome. - The wild, cruel beast is not behind the bars of a cage. It's in front of it. - Ain't no use you crying over spilled milk. My parents died at half your age. The world can be a very, very cruel, cruel place and you're fucking welcome to it. Well you gotta eat this, don't want you fucking moaning on the journey up there, right? Come on, eat it. Are you listening to me? There ain't no great white knight gonna come and save you, this isn't a fairy tale. You're fucked. - All I need is a tall ship and a star to sail her by. Goodbye, old girl. This is Doctor Gelmini from the Webster Clinic. Please give me a call when you get this as we need to schedule a follow-up appointment with myself and Dr. Bloom. Thank you. - Stop. - What the fuck. - Watch your fucking mouth. Where's the girl? - Fuck off mate. - Get her now. No, call her. - Elsie, oh Elsie dear. - Elsie, my name is Requiem and you're coming with me. I'm here to rescue you, do you understand me? We're gonna leave this place. So if you've packed, I want you to go and grab your bag. Go now. - When my mate gets back, you are gonna be. - Shut the fuck up, cunt. Good girl. Elsie, I want you to go upstairs, outside, cross the road, black car, go get in it and go now. - Mate, we need that fucking girl. - Well you don't fucking have her, do you? Listen, I'm gonna walk out that door now, try following me, I'm gonna put a bullet in your fucking head and one in your cunt for good measure, do you hear me, say yes. He was fucking right, animals, the fucking lot of you. - Fuck, shit, Jesus. - Fuck Shit Jesus is right, stay there. - Yo, you better get down here now. You know the two cunts from last night, they've only come and took the little bitch. The two cunts from last night. Just get down here now, fuck, cunts. - Got it. The address is registered to a Jonathan Murray. I've got it, must only be a few miles away. Let's go, you're driving. - What do you mean you're driving? Can't someone fucking take over? I'm always fucking driving. - Because you fucked up you cunt. - Fuck you. - I've got some time before my flight. Wanna see the girl, bring her to my hotel. - Yeah, there might be a problem with that. - I'm sorry about your parents. Listen, they're gonna come after us, those people. I'm gonna protect you, I wanna keep you safe. But it means we're gonna have to go on a trip. We're not gonna be coming back for a long time kid. There's something I've gotta do. Somebody I've gotta say goodbye to. You understand? Here, wanna listen to some music? I'm gonna be right over there. See it, just there, all right? - I'm sorry we're not open at the moment. No, no, don't come any closer. I don't want you near me. It's been 20 years. - 20 years, 8 months and 16 days. - What do you want? - I needed to see you. - Why? - It's complicated. - Oh yeah, it's complicated. - Is she? - Oh, don't you mention her name. She stopped being your daughter the day you walked out that door. We both stopped being yours that day. Everything good in her is because she grew up without you. She doesn't even know who you are. And she's better for it with every fiber of her being. Everything you touch just withers and dies. You've got no right. - There's something I need to tell you. - Well, I don't wanna hear it. What could you possibly have to say that would be any good to anyone? What did you ever have to say? Well, I can see someone wanted you, which is more than I ever did. Is that supposed to make me feel something? - It's there to make me feel something, it's there to remind me of what I did and what I've lost. And of course I knew deep down that it was fate, I'd ever be able to love you from far after what I did. How'd you come back from that? - And who made you the judge, jury an executioner? Toby did, when he. Oh, you need to leave. - Do you know when I was inside the things I did, the things I fucking well went through to get back to you? All I ever wanted to do was to get back to you. - I don't care what you went through, you are confusing your selfish desire to wind the clock back to a time when I didn't hate you. Wishing we had more time. But now I've got all the time in the world. It just doesn't involve you. - Would you ever say to me, stop? If you loved me, you'd stop. - Not in a thousand years. - Not in 1000 years. You were the love of my life. - And you were mine. But you're also the pain of it. - Are you okay? - What's this song? - It was my parents' favorite. - Come on Johnny, pick up, fuck sake. Pick up Johnny, shit. - Yo boss, we got him. - Got this. You know what you got, fucked. You got fucked Chris, and in doing so, you fucked me. So I suggest you carry on following your lead while I clean up your fucking mess. - Fuck man. - What the fuck is it now? - Yo, he's here, we're on. - You all right mate. You lost something? - You fucking want some do you? Come on then you fucker, let's fucking have it hey? - Can I help you Mr. - Hope you don't mind, I let myself in. - No, no, I don't mind. Can I offer you a drink? - What, are we celebrating? It seems one of your animals has gone loose. I want to know who he is. I want to know where he is and I wanna know where he is going. You see he's got something that belongs to me. You need to put this right. Any idea where he is? - Dover. Southampton, maybe. - Really? I was so excited to meet you. Heard so many wonderful words about you, your reputation proceeds you Mr Allen. My goodness, where are my manners, I haven't even introduced myself, The Duke. It's over, it's okay. - I'll be right back. Listen, I'm gonna be five minutes and I gotta come back for you. I will come back for you. If I'm not back in five minutes, I want to go here. I want you to run to the nearest taxi, ask him to take you here, okay? And whatever you do, don't forget this one. - Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. Johnny. Fuck. Johnny, no. - Well? - We got lucky, he was old school enough not to have a password on his phone, but smart enough to have tracking on his car. - Yo boss, we got him. - Why are you so grumpy? - Why are you so grumpy? - Drug dealers killed the only people I've ever loved. Fuck you. Where are we, where are we going? - Home. You hungry, wanna grab something to eat. Fucking cars. Well that's that decided then. Shit. Trouble? Just started fucking banging. - Let's take a look now then. Londoners? - Something like that. What do you think it is? - Oh, it's just a simple fix. That right there has just slipped out, just to replacement part. I'm assuming you've put a few miles on her. Shouldn't take more than half an hour, an hour tops. - Yeah. - An hour. - Listen, is there somewhere around here we can get something to eat, I'm fucking starving. - Ali's Diner, right up there on the left, can't miss it. - An hour. - An hour. - Thanks mate. - Duncan. Thank you Duncan. - Come on trouble. - Right, let's go, he stopped. - What is your last slave die of? Can I please have my coffee. Whereabouts are they? - Glen Coe, near Loche something or other. - All right, let's go. I'm looking for a friend of mine, drives a black Audi. He's in his late fifties. He's got a little girl with him. Aye, they were here, on a road trip, right? - Yeah, right. - I don't suppose you know which way the went. - I'm sorry, I wasn't really. - Fucking jock cunt. - Do you feel better? - Oh yes. Right, let's go. - It's that way. - The rest of the way we take on foot. Dad. - Eddie, what the hell do you want? - I need your help. Well, I'll tell you like I told you 36 years ago, you're on your own. She yours? - She's my responsibility. Well in that case we're all fucked, aren't we? - Come on you two, fucking get your noses around this. Come on. - Got the cunt. Eddie Willis, did 15 for manslaughter, some smack head. According to this he was 35 when he was convicted. He's been out five so 55 give or take. - That works out. Fuck me, this geezer's going way up north. - So fucking what? Come on. - All right, I've got an old directory listing here for David Willis in Cena, Senna? Scotland, Glen something. It's like another fucking language. - No, he says his dad's David in this article here like. - We found him. - Sweet, fucking sorted, come on you two, have one of these, come on. - Should I go check on him? He must be hungry too. - He can take care of himself. - Your his dad? - Yeah. - So he's your son? - Yeah. - Then why don't you like each other? That doesn't make much sense to me. - Well, he doesn't make much sense to me. He did something wrong once. Something I could never forgive. - Something you couldn't forgive or something you couldn't understand. - How old did you say you were? - 12 and three quarters. - 12 and three quarters. - I'll be 13 in May, May the 29th. - Aren't you gonna introduce me? - Don't change the subject. - He killed a man. - Like the people who killed my mom and dad? - No, no, that wasn't a good man. There wasn't a man at all. - But killing people isn't very good either is it? - Life's complicated Elsie. - Then explain it to me. What's this, he's always writing in it, always looking at it. - Oh Eddie. - What? - They're equations Princess. - Equations? - Yeah, you know formulas. - What for? - Equations to reverse time. Can I give you a word of advice my darling? Always have an escape plan and never let them see you bleed. There he is, the quitter. You still can't quite quit that. Elsie's made you dinner, poor girl. She seems to think you are her only hope. But don't worry, I've set her straight. Doesn't suit you drinking. But of course you know that, makes you an unpleasant person amongst other things. - Well you'd know all about that. - What's the matter? You think you're better than me? You, you show up here on my doorstep after all these years. - Mum, she died hating you. - Yeh, well she died ashamed of you. You were a stain on the family name. You know son of mine, look at you. I never wanted you. No one did. - Go fuck yourself. - You watch your mouth. - You watch your fucking mouth. Do you know, until yesterday, the only thing, and the only time I ever wanted to hear anything about you was to be told that you. - What, hey, what? Go on, talk boy. - The only time I wanted to hear anything about you was to be told you died. And believe me when I say that for 30 seconds of every day of my fucking life, I swear I've been waiting for that phone call to come. I mean, when are you gonna fucking die? You old, nasty, evil, horrible cunt, Christ, I hate you, I fucking hate you. - Think you're gonna outlive me, eh? The way you carry on, drinking yourself to death. Well, right back at you. I can't stand the sight of you. She showed me your notebook, who do you think you are? Marty McFly. You think because I'm a doctor who studied for years, respected, decorated, published for God's sake. That's my gift. You wanna reverse time but you already did it. You stupid, stupid boy. You're living in the past, you might call it nostalgia or whatever, but you're there, never in the present, always in the land of the other, consumed by regret and self-loathing. - The only thing you ever gave me of any use was pain and hurt. - Yeah, well that was more than you ever deserved. You think if you suddenly weren't there tomorrow, that anyone would give a damn? Tell me one person better off for knowing you, eh? Tell me one person who's told you that they loved you. - I lost my family, all of them. - Yeah you did. And Sasha lost hers and every other person. I lost your god damn mother. We all carry hurt, we all lost someone. Take your head out of that notebook and out of the past and out of your backside. 'cause in there is a little girl who's just lost their family too. It happens. Causality, consequence, repercussions, responsibility. - Oh yeah. You live with that did you, consequences? - We all have to live with it, there is no other choice. You remember what Oppenheimer said? Any man whose errors take 10 years to correct is quite the man. Be a man, boy. But I meant it son. I never thought about you, not once. - What am I supposed to live with her? Just because you are a lost cause doesn't mean that she is. She needs someone. And I'm too God damn old. What are the rules? - Always have an escape plan. - And. - Never let them see you bleed. - Good girl. What is it? - I feel. - Come on, it's okay, Princess. - It's like butterflies but not good. It's like they're sad. - That's grief. - I don't like it. What is it? - Come with me, I'd like to show you something. All I need is a tall ship and a star to sail bye. You loved your parents, huh? Up there. Well, they may be far away, but that doesn't mean that they don't love you anymore. Sometimes we have to love people from afar. It doesn't mean that we love them any less. - Are they really that far away? - No Princess. They're here in here. That feeling that you have, that's grief. And what is grief but love persevering. - Storm's coming. - Don't you worry, princess. They're just clouds. They always pass. - There he is, quitter. Could never quit those. - I never even looked at one for the 15 years that you were inside. - Never came to see me, not once. - What do you think this is, huh, therapy. A loving. - Didn't even come to the trial. It's okay dad, it's okay. - What you're doing under any other circumstances would be admirable. - Any other circumstances, what the hell does that mean? - Keep your voice down, she's sleeping. She's not your daughter, Eddie. She can't be someone else. You should know that above everybody. You can't lay that on her, she can't be a substitute. Oh, you could rescue her from the people that are trying, that killed her parents. Or you could save her life. Maybe even die for her. But she can never be Chloe. - You know, I remember when she was born, Chloe I mean, it was the perfect labor the midwife said, I was there the whole time next to Sasha, holding her hand. Then right at the last minute, Chloe, she got the umbilical cord wrapped around her neck. She was strangling herself. So they rushed them into theater. And I wasn't allowed in, not at first. I was outside in the hallway and I could see Sasha through one of those thin glass panels in the door. And she was looking right back at me, crying. We both were. And that's when I heard it, her cries, echoing through the corridors. And then that's when they let me in and I held her for the first time. I've never felt so much love for someone. At that moment I thought of you, only for a moment, a second if that, I thought of you and you didn't fucking deserve that. All I could think of was all the love I had for this tiny, beautiful baby girl that suddenly meant the whole fucking world to me. And I thought, there's nothing this tiny, precious, beautiful baby girl could ever do that would make me walk away from her. - But you did. - And I became the person I hate more than anything. I became you. I'm just try to do the right thing dad. - When did you ever do the right thing? You're doing this for your conscience. Well, at least it shows that you've still got one. - And that's what sets us apart. You don't regret a single day you never came to see me. You don't even regret the day that you told me that I was on my own. - You took a man's life. - He raped my wife, Jesus. What the fuck am I even talking to you about this for? What would you even know about? - Where the hell are you going. - For a drive. - Oh mate, I'm sweating like a paedophile on a fucking rape charge. So anyway, he gets his bong right? He goes half me, he walks in there and fucking toking on it. And doesn't even offer me a bit of my own gear. - He's a fucking tight cunt, isn't he? - Fucking telling me? Hold on a minute, dick I, have a look. It's only our fucking mate. - What is it? - They're here. - Okay. You know what to do, Princess. - The fuck are you doing? - We're having guests, I'm just setting the mood. You're my son, you don't think I know what you are? Go do what you do best. Elsie, did you find it? Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Okay, let's go. - Are you okay? - Getting a bit old for all this. Just give a moment. Now, go on. You go on, and don't stop for anyone. What about what you told me? - What? - Never let them see you bleed. - What else did I tell you? - Ironic, isn't it that you called us animals and here you are on all fours like an old fucking dog. - Stop. What I say to you about fucking fantasies? Your mate about? Didn't fucking think so. Do you know how I found you? 'Cause I can always smell the fucking pure ones. Only thing is, I've gotta make sure that no one else finds you the same way I did. Ha, another tragedy by your own fucking hand. But before you die, I'm gonna let you watch me fuck her with this gun. And then and only then will you take your last fucking breath, you'll be looking into my fucking eyes. You're coming with me you little bitch. And let's not forget, I'm gonna fuck you so hard with this fucking gun. - I crossed the length of the country, to set you free, to watch you run. - I must go down to the seas again for the call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied. And all I ask is a windy day with the white clouds flying and the flung spray and the blown spume. and the seagulls crying. The function of man is to live, not to exist. I shall not waste my days trying to prolong them. I shall use my time. - As long as you're happy with the product. You know the rules, no returns, no refunds, no discounts, no buybacks. All sales are final. - Tickity-boo as you might say. Always you deliver. - It is what it is, business. A unique business. I'm glad to have been a service to you, Mr. - Oh, Mikhail please. - Mikhail. Sorry. - But of course. Speak. Hey, you have to understand, it wasn't personal. It was purely business. Hold on a minute. Hold. Now listen... Mikhail, I apologize. But I have to attend to, as we say, business. So you enjoy your drink, stay as long as you want. Speak. - To market to market, to buy a fat pig. - Hey, you have to understand it wasn't personal. It was purely business. - It was all personal to me. You killed the only two people I ever loved. - Hold on a minute, hold a sec. Mikhail
