Allen came into the barn, and I said, 'Allen, the only thing I can really tell you is, she shouldn't be doing this, and you need to be careful.' I even said to the owner then, 'She's not good for this,' you know? 'She's not good for this.' I told Allen not to take Tyke on the road when he came to pick up that herd. I told him he should leave Tyke behind. It was a beautiful day, and I wanted to see the famous circus. [growls] I was seven years old, and I was kind of excited because a circus never really comes to Hawaii. So we were all excited, you know? Couldn't wait for it to start. [whistle blows, circus music starts] When we went to the circus, my son told the usher that it was my birthday, so she specially ushered us to the front seat. We had really good seats. We were, like, up front. The next thing I remember is, I'm crossing my fingers that the elephant show will start. It was either a high-wire or a trapeze act before, because I remember, I was watching and it ended, and there was some sort of announcement going on, or a fanfare or something, and a loud trumpet. Tyke was making noise. She wouldn't come out. She was just shaking herself. I saw this beige form moving around on the ground behind the curtain. Then, it came flying through the curtain followed by the elephant. I was watching it. I watched the elephant pick him up, toss him back down and roll him all the way out the curtain. I thought it was a dummy, because it was very floppy. There was no angles to it, like elbows or knees, it was all very fluid. Then when he came out is when we released, 'Oh, my God, he's not playing with a doll, it's his trainer.' WOMAN: Oh, my God. Oh, my goodness! There was a guy, he was in a blue, sort of...his outfit. It was his circus outfit, a dark-blue outfit. He's going, 'Stop, stop, stop!' Put his arms around the head of the elephant and the elephant pushed him down. I saw the elephant go up, and my daughter said, 'You know what, Mom? I think it's time for us to leave.' I remember the announcement - 'Ladies and gentlemen, please remain in your seats. Everything is under control.' And I thought to myself, it clearly was not. Then the elephant started running kind of randomly around the arena, so it's - 'This this is getting out of control. What's going on?' And the elephant started coming towards us, directly straight towards where we were sitting. We were standing already, with our children in our arms. We went down the stairs and went out. All of a sudden, a woman yelled, a woman and a man - 'Get out, get out!' I was so confused, I didn't know what to do. WOMAN: Oh, my God. I could hear somebody going, 'He's right behind of us! He's right behind of us!' [elephant trumpets] Next thing I know, we got hit, down, knocked on the ground. Then I hear this big 'boom!' I looked to the side, and there was the elephant. She looks at elephant Tyke and she says, 'Go away!' She goes, 'You leave my grandma alone. Go away!' We came out, and we're standing about here, holding our two children, and the elephant came bang through. I noticed the thing was bent out, and the elephant was right there, going like... We took our children and ran this way. I turned back and saw that the elephant had turned and went that way. ANNOUNCER: If there's anyone that needs medical assistance, please let us know at this time. There was blood all over the floor. It still didn't hit me, what had really happened. MAN ON POLICE RADIO: We need two ambulances right away. OPERATOR: OK. - Two people were crushed. - Two people crushed? - Yes, crushed. WOMAN ON POLICE RADIO: We've got people who were trampled by elephants and people who are going through great shock. CALLER: Yeah. Kicked the trainer almost to death. Before I knew it, I was in the arena in a stretcher. REPORTER: It started off as a day at the circus. Then, before horrified spectators, an elephant went wild, trampling its trainers and escaping into the streets near the Blaisdell Arena. One person was killed. Police say nine people were injured, and at least three others were taken to local hospitals. REPORTER 2: His handler was 37-year-old Allen Campbell, who gave his life to save his young assistant. REPORTER 3: The African elephant's owner is struggling to understand what caused it to suddenly become so agitated. REPORTER 4: Police radios caught the frantic yells of Honolulu patrolmen, as Tyke went on her tear through Kaka'ako. POLICE OVER RADIO: Do you want us to shoot the elephant? SERGEANT OVER RADIO: Negative. On the police scanner, we hear, 'Elephant on the loose in Kaka'ako, heading toward Queen Street.' And we all stopped and looked at each other, thinking, 'Did we just hear "elephant?"' So my photographer and I drove up this way. He dropped me off right here, on the corner of Ward and Queen. I was just coming down Ward Avenue and turned onto the street, and when I got onto this street, I saw the elephant coming down the road here with the police officers behind. I took my shoes off, and I ran with my nylon stockings down that street, looking for the elephant. Came up to the corner and kind of looked, you know - 'What's going on?' I saw the elephant chasing a person around in the lot, really, really agitated. The person was running, dancing around the car. The elephant was moving fast, the person was moving a little faster. MAN: Look out! Run! I remember glancing out my window, and I see an elephant, going in circles, around and around. I thought, 'Something's wrong.' MAN: Watch out! I see this gentleman try to close the wire gate on Tyke, and she just knocks it open like it's nothing. Whoa, whoa! And Tyke just goes after him. It's clear that he was in danger. I saw a police officer raise his pistol and fire the first shot. [gunshots] REPORTER: Those were the first shots fired. From there, she made her way through the streets of Kaka'ako. I'm screaming, 'No!' [car tires screech] [siren] And as we rounded the corner, we saw just an army of SWAT-team members and police and fire trucks. We were told to stay back, so we sat basically behind the police cars. We saw Tyke right there, sitting up. She was sitting up, and I just saw her trunk, flailing back and forth, because she was swatting away the barrage of bullets coming her way. REPORTER: We're told circus officials had tried to tranquilize the animal, but it just didn't work, and when the public safety became an issue, the police did what they had to do. NEWSCASTER: Right now, we have a live report from our reporter at the scene. Dick, right now, they're preparing to shoot the elephant again. They're behind us, behind the crowd. What they're trying to do is clear the area before they shoot the elephant. The elephant is down. When I got on the scene, he was chasing the owner of the pig review. [gunshots] Those are shots, I think. WOMAN: Come over here, girls. [shooting continues] People were praying, people were just silently sobbing. Um... I heard, I think, a child's voice here and there - 'What's happening?' REPORTER: William Dallas Beckwith looked dead as the angry elephant, Tyke, tossed his lifeless body from side to side, but he's very much on his feet, with only cuts and bruises, no broken bones and no internal injuries. The only one that really could get through to the elephant was already put down by the elephant. No-one else could ever get to that elephant, so there was no use in trying. REPORTER: Beckwith has been working for the Hawthorn Corporation, the elephant's owner, for about a month. He was Campbell's assistant. Tonight, the elephant's owner says the animal has never been a problem before. What made it go so out of control, kill its handler, then trample people and property on city streets? I have had elephants since 1954. This is 1994, and have never, ever once had an elephant go loose or go after somebody in a building in all those years. REPORTER: Among today's claims, that there were previous incidents with Tyke, and circus officials should have been aware of the potential dangers here. In Minot, North Dakota, an elephant named Tyke belonging to the Hawthorn Group, again got out of control and had to be contained. Prior to that, in Altoona, Pennsylvania, an elephant named Tyke broke loose from her chains, ran around the arena until she was controlled. REPORTER: Animal Rights Hawaii wants the court and city officials to ban animal performances in the future. [trainers shout commands] My first encounter with Tyke, I walked into the barn. Mr Cuneo was showing me the herd. She turned, ears out, picked up a mouthful of hay, or trunkful of hay, and threw it at me. And I said, 'Uh-oh.' Mr Cuneo downplayed it - 'Oh, Tyke. She does that with everyone. She's just getting to know you.' And I looked at that elephant, and I said, 'Uh-oh.' This is me with Tyke and Jackie in Japan in '89. She was a pretty fair size back then. I'm 5'8". I'd say right there, she'd have been over 7 feet tall. She knew her tricks, and she did everything. She was a pretty versatile elephant. She'd throw the balls and catch batons and ring the bell, and she used to ride a tricycle, which she got too big for. Um, she was a good little working elephant, you know? Tyke was one of the performers, so she would only be brought over to my side of the barn periodically. But when she was brought over, I couldn't even go in the room with my elephants because she'd charge me. She'd have her ears out. She was... she was an unhappy camper. When she was over there, I just didn't go in. I threw hay from the other side. She had quite an attitude. This is the last memento of Tyke. This is a piece from her tusk. I took this from her to, let's say, equal the playing field, because I noticed she was trying to use it on me. As I walked by her, she was a little bit more... She only had one, and it was on her left side. She was a little bit more apt to rub me with this tusk. This tusk hit me before her skin, before I felt her skin touching me, and she knew it. She'd put a bit more pressure to push with this tusk. So I said, 'OK, we have to equal the playing field.' Once I took that from her, she became a better elephant for me. I moved to Venice because of the connection with the circus. I spent 30 years or so involved with Ringling Brothers. This was their winter home. We'd spend ten months out on tour, then come down to here for three months, then start it all over again. I mean, I can't go anywhere without remembering something that went on back when I was 18, 19 years old. I've been coming here since I was a kid. I'm constantly walking in, you know, memories. My mother asked me to take my siblings to the circus. The circus was in town. I knew nothing about circus, really, and what goes on. So I took them to the show, and that was my first time. The last act to come on was the elephant act, and that's what did it. That's what did it. It was the elephant act. The music was jamming, the elephants were moving. Seeing Gunther Gebel-Williams, it was one big party, and I wanted to be a part of it. It was the magic of Gunther Gebel-Williams. It was something about him that made me say, 'I want to work with those animals because of this gentleman.' The way he handled the animals, I wanted to be a part of his crew, and I ran away with the circus that night. But from the moment I joined the circus, I'd always been 'nigger this' and 'nigger that'. 'Black men don't work here. Black men will never be...' I was 18 years old, and I stood up, sick of all the negative, and I said, 'I'm going to be the first black animal trainer around here.' Fast forward 15 years, I was the boss's right-hand man. I was working with all the animals that he was working with. My first job was with Hawthorn Corporation. I was a trainer for them. I was in charge of trucking them around, their safety, their welfare, their food. Anything and everything about the herd was all on me. REPORTER: Tyrone Taylor is living his dream, performing and traveling from city to city with his herd of elephants. He's one of only 100 elephant trainers in the country. Intelligence is important, and the desire. I love this work. This is not work to me, this is playing. TYRONE: Mr Cuneo's elephants were known as bad elephants, 'bad' meaning disposition. He had some tough elephants. You had to be really firm with them to get around them. We had Tyke, Jackie, Haddie and Queenie. Tyke and Jackie were the African, and Queenie and Haddie were my two Asians. Tyke was temperamental. I enjoyed working with her. She was very... At the point I had taken over with her, she was, I'd say, very gun-shy, very touchy. She was instantly expecting some type of discipline, and I saw that in her. I saw that. I had to read this elephant. I had to rediscover everything about this elephant, because no-one told me anything about her. I was the compound manager, and I was also in charge of taking care of the breeding bull that they had. When the acts were in, they all were lined up and chained in the barn. Other than getting practice, they stayed chained up 22 hours a day... ..not being able to wander around and visit and interact and do all the tactile stuff that elephants do so much of in their daily lives with each other. They just weren't able to be elephants at all. They were little pets on a string that people wanted them to be. I was one of the very few women that were working elephants at that time. It was testosterone-fueled. It was guys being tough, being macho - 'I can beat up a full-grown elephant. I can bring a full-grown elephant to their knees.' It was just more the culture back then. They would be beaten until the elephants were screaming, until they gave up whatever behavior they were doing or not doing. [man shouts, elephant trumpets] Tyke, she required a lot more discipline because she was strong-willed. She just fought tooth and nail to not have to do what she was doing. She required a lot more... ..work - 'tuning up' is what they used to call it - than some of the others. Just a lot of discipline, heavy-handed discipline. A lot of spankings. It was ugly, it was ugly. Things have happened in her lifetime, and she has kept those thoughts. She's a very smart elephant. She kept all that with her. Being as large as she is, if she was afraid of something or something wasn't going her way, she would just leave. She would step out. That's what I mean, 'stepping off.' She would leave. REPORTER: An African elephant named Tyke went wild before a circus performance. The elephant burst through the doors of the Jaffa Mosque, where the circus was performing, causing about $12,000 in damage. TYRONE: Altoona, Pennsylvania. We get there, and another trainer had came in to see if I needed any help. He was in the same organization. We were both in the Hawthorn Corporation. His groom, the trainer's groom, was really agitating my elephant that day. She wasn't having any of it, and she decided to go run around and run through doors. The police were called out. I believe they were going to shoot her. They wanted me to step away from her. They were telling me to step away, and they had firearms out. There was no way for her to get back in the building. She's on a two-story overhang. What are we going to do? Well, my job is not to leave my animal. I was not going to leave my animal. I was going to get her back to where she needed to be. And we did all right. We got her back to the barn and taken care of and put her away, and everything was good. No-one was hurt, but she did run. She did cause a spectacle and she did run. Then I knew she was a runner. I think the first time I heard of Tyke was in 1993. Someone from the Humane Society in Altoona, Pennsylvania called us, said an elephant had crashed out of an indoor arena. knocked out some doors, wound up out on a loading dock, and it took them a couple of hours to get her under control. Luckily, it was a loading dock and she couldn't step off. If it had been a street out there, she would have been gone. It would have happened in Altoona instead of Hawaii. The person from the Humane Society asked me what they should do. Of course, I said, 'Don't ever let her perform again. She's an African. She did that once, she's going to do it again.' Africans just don't put up with what Asians put up with for so long. That's what people don't know about elephants - they're just dangerous. You have a false sense of security somehow in a performing situation. I know probably as much as anybody about how they act and what they do, and they'll always surprise you. Something that you don't expect could easily happen at any time. After Altoona, I even said to the owner then, 'She's not good for this,' you know? 'She's not good for this.' This was my personal opinion from what I see and also from my history. I've worked Africans. I've been taught how to do all this from a great trainer. I was expressing that I don't think she's good for this, but I was being dismissed as, I don't know what I'm talking about. 'You just need to be firmer. You need to be heavier. You need to get her back in there, and this is how you do it.' Over at Hawthorn, they had a reputation for heavy-handed training. A lot of the trainers were old-school trainers. They'd been around. They'd come through the ranks because they've had their families in this business. It's passed down, generation to generation. JOHNNY WALKER: I was born in the business, fourth generation. My parents worked with animals. My dad was in concessions, my mom was an aerialist. I knew in third grade I wanted to work elephants. I wanted to make it my life. RINGMASTER: The biggest performers of them all, the Walker Brothers Circus performing elephants! I was taught how to use a bullhook, you know? Most gentlemen... You cue with your right hand, you carry the bullhook in your left hand. You're cueing them by voice. If there's a problem, the elephant's getting lazy, instead of skipping, it's going to - 'I don't feel like doing this today,' maybe you'll take the bullhook and shift it to your right hand, then they see you moving the bullhook. Not just me. You could take certain trainers that I grew up with could go in to Tyke and work her the same way I did. There's just a certain discipline that you've got and a certain way you work elephants, you know? Then you have certain trainers that came in that... Like I said, I didn't know Allen. I didn't know this Tyrone. I didn't know any of these guys. I grew up with a certain era of trainers, then these guys came along, you know? When I'm affectionate with my animal, with my elephant, it's all hands-on, it's all love. It's all here - it's under the leg, it's behind the ear. It's showing them all this love they're going to get. They get that from each other, from their touches, so I have to be more hands-on and physical, and not just light touches, I'm giving hands-on. I'm letting them know, 'You're elephant, I'm elephant. It's good.' Even through my tone of voice - 'It's good.' A lot of my work is done from over here. I don't have to come across unless I really need to catch an ear. Remember, that's elephant. That's ten foot tall. How am I going to get her head down? Put it at the top, head down. She'll bring head down. If I have this and I just want to move and I don't want to bring the hook out, then I can say, 'Move. Move, move, move. Move back. Come in line. Come in line.' Voice changes. 'Come in line. All right, come in line. Trunk, trunk! All right. Move up tail, move up tail!' Then we move out. Everything has changed. Now we become elephant. We step hard. Because elephants, even though they step light, they're stepping hard. SALLY: Elephants are big and they can be very dangerous. The theory back then was, as long as they are afraid of you, they're not going to do anything. I was told that you had to use a hook. You had to be tough with them. You had to beat them up if they showed any kind of reluctance to do what you wanted. If you happened to have an elephant that was strong-willed and spirited, they were the ones that were going to give you trouble because they thought about it. They looked at you and went, 'You know, you're full of it. I don't have to do what you say. I'm 10,000lbs, you're not. That little stick is not going to help you any.' And elephants are methodical. Asian elephants will wait for years to kill you if they are so inclined. They hold a grudge. They have long memories. African elephants too. They're very bright, they're very intelligent. They will remember you forever, whether it's good or bad, and you better hope that they're thinking good thoughts if you're having to go in with them again. Ty! Ty? I went through several grooms that Mr Cuneo gave me, but I knew I needed only one. My groom was Warren Wilkinson. He's a gentleman that I've known since he was, like, nine years old. I told you I ain't changed, bro. I told you I ain't changed. - How you been? - Oh, man! It's been a long time. WARREN: I trust Tyrone with my life. I've known him my whole life. At Hawthorn, first thing he did was, he brought me over, let me see the elephants, explained to me a little bit about them. Gave me the run-down that they were different than the animals I was used to working with, that they were a lot more aggressive. This was, like, the raw days right here. This is my first act. Oh, my God. Dude, this is crazy, watching this. TYRONE: Tyke, Tyke! I'm constantly yelling 'Tyke,' even if I'm working with the other elephants. I yell back, 'Tyke, Tyke!' so that she knows that I'm constantly watching her. Right there. WARREN: Yeah, she hesitated a little bit. TYRONE: Backing off. You've got to see it ahead of time. She doesn't get up like the others. She's always backing out. She doesn't move as fast as the others, and this is not because of physical ailment, it's just her personality. She's a little defiant. WARREN: And stubborn. You've still got to give her credit, 'cause she still did. She might have hesitated, might have stepped out every now and then - but she did a good job. - She was a smart elephant. TYRONE: She was very good. WARREN: I loved that trick. TYRONE: That's why John Cuneo loved it. Yeah. She thought she was in trouble right there. She missed the baton, then she shied away, thinking she was in trouble. WARREN: Because nine out of ten... TYRONE: She probably would have been. Someone would have gave her some reprimand for them throwing the baton wrong. WARREN: That's what I miss, right there. I'm telling you, dude, I loved when she did that. In the past - I really believe this, from her past - she thought she was in for some type of big trouble once she got back to the line because of everything she was doing in the act, all these little things. WARREN: Oh, yeah. TYRONE: Remember that day? This is where she decides to go in her own direction and step out of the herd. This is a potential danger right here. She knows what she's doing. She knew she had done things in the act, and she knew she could face reprimand inside the picket line. In the back of my mind, it was a thought that she could potentially run, hurting someone, at any given point, could bolt out and do some damage. I didn't feel it was necessary for her to be there because of the potential danger already that she was showing me. I knew that something could happen. TYRONE: Minot, North Dakota. It was an outside date. That means our ring was set up outside. We were at a fairground. Mr Cuneo had sent out another groom for me. He says, 'You need another groom,' and I said, 'I don't.' I had Warren, I had my groom, and I didn't need another groom. He was persistent on working with Tyke, and no-one works with Tyke but me. I don't need anyone messing with Tyke or doing anything getting her attention. And this gentleman proceeded to keep calling her name. I told the gentleman, 'Don't say anything. Just stand there. Don't say a word.' But he was persistent on just calling her name, letting it be known, 'I know that elephant. I know how to handle Tyke. I know what to do with Tyke.' Everyone that came from that organization thought they knew what to do with Tyke. It was the wrong thing to do. That particular time, she waited until the right time, and she went after the guy. I just heard Ty calling Tyke's name. I turned around, and that's when I seen Tyke attacking Mike Pursley. She turned and knocked him into a portable dumpster. We had a portable trash container, huge container. She pinned him up against that container and used her trunk to grind him into that container and used her trunk to knock him down and go on him, used the base of the trunk, and had her trunk wrapped around one ankle and kept pulling him back. She kicked him, would pull him back to her, kick him, pull him back to her. She did that probably three or four times. She was trying to kill him, so I had to get her off. What I did was, I stuck my bullhook into her ear. That's all I had. There's no time to wail and flail. And that's when she took off from Ty. We were on a 20-minute chase through Minot State fairground for her. Ty had Queenie. He yelled for me to grab a chain. I grabbed a chain from underneath the truck, put it around my neck and we took off running. She was trapped between some buildings, wreaking havoc, and I had to go in, no-one but me. He passed Queenie off to me. He started going toward the workshop. I just called her real stern, got her attention, the same way I always had - no discipline and opened up. I knew I had to sacrifice myself. I had to just show her no hook in hand. Hook was over here, but no hook in hand. And she turned, ears flared out. I just started thinking, 'bad.' I'm like, 'Now I'm going to have to leave this elephant unattended if he needs help.' To my surprise, she just walked right up to him. She ran up to me like a big dog, and just towered above me and let me give her all this love and hugs. And inside, I am scared. I am just heart beating, 'cause she just tried to kill someone. And to, I think, both our surprises, she didn't give us any problems. She literally walked back to the picket line, and we chained them both up. Once I got her back to the herd and got her chained down, I said, 'We're not going to use her anymore. I'm not going to take her off these chains unless it's to load her up and bring her back to the line, because it's too dangerous. Thank God no-one was hurt.' I mean, someone was hurt - Mike was, but no-one in the park. While it was going on... ..I don't really want to say it was scary, because I really wasn't thinking of it like that. After it was all done and said and me and Tyrone sat down, that's when it hit me. I won't lie to you, that's when it hit me. If I'm not mistaken, I even told Tyrone, like, 'Dude, that freaked me out.' That was the last time, in July. July, yeah, '93, was the last time I used her in a performance. I still had to go... My contract ran through September, October, but I wouldn't use her. I used just the three. Despite Mr Cuneo and us battling, I just used the three. I told him, 'This elephant is going to kill someone.' I just felt like she should be in a sanctuary, zoo or some type of establishment that's just going to let her be an elephant. [ship's horn] WARREN: Two days before I left Hawthorn, Allen came into the barn. I was working in there with the elephants. He was like, 'If you work my Africans the way you work these, you'll be great.' I said, 'Allen, I'm not going to be here.' He was like, 'You'll be here.' I said, 'No, dude. I've got to go to Florida. I'm meeting up with Tyrone. We're doing Ringling. I'm not going to be here.' 'I'll see you in a couple weeks.' 'Whatever, Allen. The only thing I can really tell you is, she shouldn't be doing this, and you need to be careful.' His last words to me before he walked out of the barn was, 'If she gets out of line, my Africans will get her back into line.' I said, 'All right. I wish you the best, man.' He said, 'All right, I'll see you in a couple weeks.' I started laughing. I said, 'I'm not going to be here!' He's like, 'All right,' and he walked out of the barn. The last I heard about Allen was when I seen it on the news. SALLY: I told Allen not to take Tyke on the road when he came to pick up that herd. I told him he should leave Tyke behind. He laughed. Typical macho reaction - 'Oh, no, I can handle it. I can get a handle on her.' He had the option. She could have stayed. I could have put her in the bull barn and she would have been fine. But that wasn't an option. The Hawthorn Corporation did not offer that as an option to Allen. It was all or nothing. Typically, the bookings that Hawthorn Corporation made were for an act of so many elephants, and if you didn't have that many elephants, that contract wasn't going to be upheld. The number of elephants was paramount in the bookings. WARREN: To Cuneo, they were there to make him money. To me, money's not worth a life. There's no amount of money that can repay a life. So I think he should have been done had her off the road doing that. Before me and Tyrone got to her, he should have had her, you know, away from that. But you know, greed makes people do stupid things. [show music, elephant trumpets] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, please remain seated. Please remain seated. WOMAN: Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! That's... Oh, boy! Oh! Oh, my gosh! Oh, my gosh! SALLY: Allen wasn't ever the focus. Allen was the by-product, he was the by-catch. He was collateral damage. She wanted to get rid of that groom. Allen was trying to stop her. She said, 'You know, this isn't your fight, but if you're going to insist on it, I'm going to make sure you get out of my way so I can finish what I was doing.' And then she stands, she's looking, she's got her ears up. I'm sure she's listening to the other elephants that I'm sure are yelling in the background. Even if you can't hear it on tape, there's no doubt she's listening to the other elephants. She's trying to decide what she's going to do, and then that guy moves. It's just a hair that he moves, but it's enough to bring her attention back to him. She didn't have a plan. It's not like, 'I'm going to catch the bus' or 'I've got a waiting car for me that's going to speed me off, and we're going to live on the lam in Mexico' or anything. Just the natural flight response triggered in her. She knew she had to get out. She wanted to get away from it all. She wanted to get away from the noise, the huge amounts of adrenaline that were flowing everywhere by that time in the arena. She knew she was in really big trouble, and she knew she would have been chained up, she would have been beaten a lot, and she said, 'I'm going to get out of Dodge,' and took off. [Tyke trumpets] ♪ MUUNGANO NATIONAL CHOIR: Sanctus [gunshot] [sirens] [shots echo] She was shot 87 times. She was shot all over her body, in her eyes. I remember that huge head just leaning against the car. It was heartbreaking to see such a majestic creature, such a beautiful, huge, gorgeous elephant lying on the street of Honolulu, just lying on the street of Honolulu with that ridiculous pink party hat on. My boss called me, and he said, 'Hey, we've got to go retrieve that elephant.' I said, 'That elephant that was on the news?' He said, 'Yeah. I think they killed it. It's down in the Kaka'ako area.' I said, 'Oh, my goodness! They killed it? Why did they kill it?' He said, 'I don't know, we just got the call. We have to go pick up the body.' There was a car here, just like how it is now. She was lying down on her right side with her legs sticking out across the road here. I could see some blood off of her. I remember seeing, like, a tear stain coming from her eye. I remember that, you know? That struck me as like she was crying - 'Why did they have to kill me?' you know? We had a front-end loader come in here, scooped her legs up, slid the chain underneath, secured it, did the same for the back legs. Then the operator in the crane tightened up on the rigging. Then I reversed my trailer back under her body, hanging up. And then the crane operator loaded her down on the deck. We had a little tarp. It wasn't much - just to kind of cover her face. We couldn't cover her whole body. Then we had a police escort. We went up to the Halawa industrial area, where the quarantine station is located, and that's where we took her body. REPORTER: A family placed leis right near the spot where Tyke fell to her death. Animal-rights groups had a memorial service for Tyke right where the female African elephant was shot down. REPORTER 2: Supporters of Animal Rights Hawaii returned to the site where circus elephant, Tyke, was gunned down. The president of the group says the elephant is not to blame for the tragedy. She blames what she says is the inhumane treatment most circus animals receive. They're shackled often 22 out of 24 hours, are routinely deprived of food and water, made to wear stupid costumes, and this is considered wholesome family fun? In the days following her death, we worked very quickly, and we scheduled demonstrations. We could see that this had really made a difference. So we decided that we would go forward and try to make sure that this could not happen again. REPORTER: Animal-rights groups nationwide are speaking out about the circus incident. REPORTER 2: Acting mayor, Jeremy Harris, today said he is thinking about banning any circuses featuring animal acts from city facilities. STEVEN KENDALL: The Tyke incident was an international incident. This was going to affect circuses worldwide. This was going to have an impact, we thought from the beginning, not only on the smaller city councils in the United States but all across the world, for that matter. Don't go to the circus! STEVEN: I'd worked private investigations for a number of years. I drafted a proposal for Ringling Brothers to deal with the animal-activist groups. it started as something small and became a much larger issue. REPORTER: For ten years, Steve Kendall of Scott Township spied on animal-rights groups for Ringling Brothers and other circuses. I have a number of individuals that are directly inside animal-rights groups. Some of them may be out there protesting. You're talking about double agents? I tried to make it look like I was friendly with some of them, but at the same time, I was gathering the information. STEVEN: They take them out of those. MAN: They're still shackled right now. STEVEN: For the public safety. MAN: You want to take a walk? Just talk. STEVEN: Good, I don't mind. MAN: Let me do it to you some time - shackle you for 23 hours. I'll let you walk around. STEVEN: That's misinformation. It's not 23 hours. MAN: How many hours is it? I'll use that from now on. How many hours a day are they shackled? STEVEN: I can't give you a direct figure. MAN: How do you know? Give me an estimate. STEVEN: They take them out every four hours. I helped organize counter demonstrations against the animal-rights activist groups. Initially, we had to pay individuals to come out, because we needed to have groups of people that would at least be able to get the attention of the public to show that there were individuals that supported the circus. The animal-rights activists, just ignore them. Have a great time. Throw it right in the garbage, where it belongs. Have a good time. I look at the animal-rights groups as being, at times, a minority extremist group, where their views are going to be totally against what the public wants, what the circus industry wants, and even, for the most part, politicians. I met with the Vice-President of Ringling Brothers, and he said, 'Steve, we're going to need you to go over to Hawaii right away to deal with the fallout from this particular accident,' and at the same time too, deal immediately with the city council considering the fact that the animal-activist groups wanted to ban the use of animals in entertainment immediately after this incident happened. TYLER RALSTON: This building here is Honolulu Hale. This is where the city council headquarters is. It's where we did a lot of the work with testifying in favor of the bills we were trying to get passed that were geared at banning live exotic animals in performing shows, such as circuses and traveling shows. Chairman Felix, members of the committee. The animals most commonly used in circuses and other traveling animal acts are wild, and can behave instinctively and unpredictably. If they become out of control, they are further punished, up to and including death, as we experienced with Tyke. Prior to this event, our animal-related position had been that we just said that animals that are used in entertainment, whether they be domestic or wild animals that are used in entertainment, should be treated humanely. That was our position. After the Tyke incident and relooking at our position statement, we really came to the conclusion that you couldn't treat a wild animal humanely in the entertainment business. The circus industry will tell you that they are repositories of endangered species. USDA inspection records of John Cuneo's elephants show a dearth of even the most basic husbandry records. They will boast that their animals perform because they like to. STEVEN: I remember them as if it were yesterday. Cathy Goeggel, the ringleader, I'd say, of Animal Rights Hawaii, was a nasty individual. She was not someone you could talk with or reason with. She had a one-track mind, and that was to lash out against anybody that was opposed to their point of view. It was outrageous. The industry, the circus industry, employs people to say that everything is wonderful, everything is great. The elephants love doing what they're doing. It's like the emperor has no clothes. These animals are all trained through positive reinforcement. There's a lot of misconceptions on how you get an animal to perform a certain act. When an elephant stands on its hind legs, this is something it does naturally in the wild - they reach branches off trees. They also stand on their hind legs when they're engaging in the act of sex. The facts remain that the animals don't do anything other than what they do in the wild, and this is incorporated into the acts. I argued the fact that the public had a right to choose whether or not they wanted to see this type of entertainment. The fact is that the circus had a history going back hundreds of years, and it's continued to gather families from across the nation that come out and support the circus and go to the shows. Some would say the circus is an old tradition, it's part of American culture. Slavery, as well as child labor, was an American tradition. It was part of American culture and is now part of American history. And American history is where exotic animals in traveling shows needs to go. When videos or information was provided to the politicians, it didn't seem to make a difference, or didn't seem to get a result. That's confusing to me. I don't know why that did happened that way. I don't know why we didn't end up with a result that was more supportive of the bills. Well... ..I would say that it involved a lot of money and it's a business, and that the argument that, 'It only happened one time' might have prevailed. On the other hand, we've never had another elephant come into this community. So bill or no bill, legislation or no legislation, the outcome was and has been that there has been no elephant coming back. We have not had live circuses with wild animals allowed here. It has not come back. So ultimately, it did prevail. ED STEWART: We agreed to take Nicholas and Gypsy, the two last elephants that were at the Hawthorn Corporation's place in Illinois, the same place where Tyke came from. If you guys want to take off, you can go ahead now. This is Nicholas, the former circus elephant, from Hawthorn Corporation. HANDLER: Nick? Target. MARGARET WHITTAKER: When we started training Nicholas, he was, of all the elephants that I've been involved in converting from free to protected contact, he was probably the most afraid of the target when we presented it. He would turn and duck his head and squint his eyes like he was anticipating being hit. I think that's indicative of the harsh training that he received before. He had that level of fear of something on a stick. That's a big, muddy foot. When he comes in, he knows nobody's ever going to hit him here. Are you thirsty? I think he wants a warm drink. If he doesn't want to come to the wall and he doesn't want to work and he doesn't want to present his foot or his ear or his trunk or open his mouth, he doesn't have to. He can stay over there or go back outside. Nick, open. Oh, where are you going? Come here. Nick, open. Can I see that tooth? Good boy. Let me see. There you go. Good boy, Nick. Good boy! All right, Nick. All right. ED: Sometimes elephants come in, they don't know even that you can eat the grass, that that's even an option, because a lot of elephants in captivity have never been able to walk on grass. Behind me is Gypsy. She was in the circus her whole life, like Tyke. Her life is different. If she wants to go in the lake, she can go in the lake. If she wants to scratch on a tree, she can scratch on a tree. If she wants to dig her own mud hole, she can dig her own mud hole and roll in it. Tyke could have been right next to her. I think in 50 years, we're going to look back and say, 'Can you even believe that we used to keep elephants on chains and drag them in trailers and trucks and trains around the country to ostensibly teach children about elephants?' It just is amazing to me that it's happening at this point in time. But in 50 years, in 10 years, hopefully, it's not going to be around. A lot has changed. The times have changed. Circuses have changed. There's nothing going on much. A lot of it's just memories. This was actually a safe haven. There was never any animal-rights activists here. It was more like the city council and all the higher-ups really felt that it was too much to have the circus. This is the old circus winter quarters. We used to get the shows together. Ringling Brothers started from here, then went out on tour for ten months, then came back at the end of the season. This is the arena, the big top, where the performances were. Inside here, this is where they were held. This is all that's left of it. It's been stripped down. All the seats, the outside shell, everything taken off. I'm grateful that the shell is still standing, but it's sad. We had a good time here. Every time I look at it, I do remember the good times that we had here. It was home. That's why I never went home again. I never went home again. [distant circus music and show sounds] ANNOUNCER: Ladies and gentlemen, your guest host for this evening's performance. [distant applause, cheering] [blows whistle] I'm from the old school, so I feel that animals really... That's circus to me. Circus is animals - liberty acts, cat acts, elephant acts. People love them. You see that. I look at the public when they're watching my show. You watch them when the animals come out. They love the animals. They love to see them. But these animal activists and people like this, they're not going to stop, and when they're done with us, I'm sure they're going to start on pets. People want elephants. 'Well, we're going to make life so miserable for them and hard, that they can't.' They just keep chipping away. They just keep chipping away. I want elephants. I do Shrine Circuses now. If they had in their budget for elephants, I'd lease elephants in a heartbeat. ANNOUNCER: We'd like to remind everybody that we're going to be here throughout the weekend. We do have one more circus performance today at 5:30. Tomorrow, we only have one performance at 3pm. Tell all your friends and neighbors to come on out and come to the circus. Ty and Tyke, they had some kind of special connection. We used to walk in that barn in the morning and he would walk up to that elephant and be like, 'Africa!' She would lift her head up and rumble. Just watching it, I could see the connection. TYRONE: I loved that elephant. There was something about her that I connected with. I liked the way she showed me her affection. She'd stand above me. I'm 6'3", and this elephant's standing... I'm looking up underneath her chin when she stood above me. She let me hug on her neck, and... She just let me be around her. That's what I loved most about her - she'd let me be around her. When I look back at it, if I could have changed my life and said elephants wouldn't be involved, it would be devastating. The time I spent with elephants was amazing, just priceless. There's no other animal I've ever worked with that can compare with what I got with working with elephants, and the relationship. There's nothing better than being hugged by an elephant. It's just the most wonderful, warm... When they take their trunk and blow against your face and they wrap their trunk around you, it's fabulous, wonderful. But those days... ..are gone. If I could have worked elephants without all the brutality, that would have been fabulous, absolutely fabulous. And when I look back, like I said, I'm sure there's a special place in hell for me for what I did to the elephants, because that was what I was told I had to do to stay alive and to keep those elephants in line. But now I know that was all nonsense. ED: I'm probably the most critical person of all of our place here. I don't drive through here and think how nice it is that they're eating grass, I drive through and think, 'Why are they behind a fence?' Our philosophy is that elephants are not designed for captivity at all. You can do what you can for them, but you'll never match what they should have if they were in the wild. People say, 'What do you think went wrong, why did Tyke do such an unnatural thing?' That's the first natural thing that Tyke did in her life, was to run. She did it in Altoona, she injured people in North Dakota and finally, in Hawaii, she acted like a real elephant and said, 'I'm not supposed to be here. I'm tired.' Whatever excuse they gave - somebody made a noise, somebody walked behind her, it's always 'somebody honked a horn' - they always have some excuse why elephants take off. But Tyke, on that final day of her life, exhibited real elephant behavior, and it didn't fit the streets of Hawaii. Captions by CSI Australia
