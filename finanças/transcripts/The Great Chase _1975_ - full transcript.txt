I guess you have one more Championship Trophy now? Thanks. Do you have a new mission for me? Yes. I was going after a drug ring and I heard the name of a man you've been looking for. What? Henry Nakatani? I've chased him from the USA, to Latin America and onto South East Asia. You were right to think that he was back in Japan. Where's he hiding now? In Akasaka. That's his hide-out. He's living a life of luxury. Must be sponging money from his old friends. Ojisama, thank you. Thank you for letting me join your organisation. Failure will not be tolerated. If by any chance we lose Henry Nakatani then the truth behind your father's death will never be uncovered. This is what he looks like now. It seems like he had his face done in America. His appearance has changed since he was in prison 6 years ago. The colour of poppy... Is red. 23 red. 8 black. Sir, you can't do that. It's alright. A check I've signed is as good as cash. No sir, it's a rule. Take it away. Do you know who the hell I am? One call from me and hundreds of men will bring cash! Spin it! If you still doubt me, call this place. Here! Sir, may I buy that card? Oh yeah? Now we're talking. This is as good as a money tree, you know! I believe you. We are both gamblers, after all. I like you. You, come with us. Right now. Wait a minute. - He owes me money. - Not our problem. Who do you think you are, woman? Don't be rude. Hello, Shinobu Yashiro Fan Club. Are you calling to join? Oh, I see. For flowers. Brother, you are late! Oh, don't talk like Yoko. Four hours just to get the flowers from a market to here. We can't do business that way! Oh God, you're acting more like Mum every day. Only because you're so useless, Brother! C'mon! - Is this the home of Shinobu Yashiro? - Yes. Oh, you are the one who wanted to join the fan club. May we please have your address and name? It's ¥15,000 to join. I am her friend from High School. I heard that Shinobu won the Golden Cup. Oh, that was an awesome race! Of course she was great and her car was perfectly maintained. - I did it by the way. - Brother, don't be a show-off! Oh, that's Shinobu! Shinobu, welcome home! Welcome home! Hey guys! I'm home! Shinobu! Shinobu! It's me! Yuko? Yes! Yuko, it's you! What's up? - It's been so long! - How have you been? Cheers! I haven't had a drink with you in so long. I know! It's been five years since the last time. Back when we won the Tokyo competition. Your block there was amazing! But the reason we won was for your spike, Shinobu. We had so much fun back then. Yukiko. This is a very nice shop you have. My uncle asked me if I wanted to give it a shot. It's very challenging but I get to go abroad to find stock for the shop. Isn't this nice? I found it last time I was abroad. I wanted to show my aunt how much you've grown. If only she had lived longer... My father's death startled her too much. Shinobu, forget about that. Being able to forget is one of the virtues of men. I will never forget. Shinobu... I'm so close to finding out the truth. I'm almost there. You still think about the incident 5 years ago, don't you. SHIP'S CAPTAIN YASHIRO ARRESTED ¥500,000,000 OF HEROIN SEIZED DRUGS ARRESTED CAPTAIN YASHIRO SENTENCED TO 12 YEARS IN PRISON ENEMY OF THE PEOPLE YASHIRO MASAYUKI I don't know anything! I really don't! Someone trapped me. Someone's laughing behind the scenes. It doesn't matter how long it takes. Find them for me! - Shut that crap! - I'm innocent! I didn't do it! Dad! Dad! My dear... Dad! Dear! Dad... What happened to you? He committed suicide. He drank poison when we weren't watching. But, these scars... I guess he was just being rough. The coroner says that it's suicide. Dad! Father... I will never forget... Your suffering. Or the despicable men who brutally ended your life. I won't forgive them. Watch me. I will hunt them down to the ends of the earth! ♪ I chose my own path ♪ So there's no use complaining about it. ♪ Let the flowers blossom ♪ In my heart. ♪ And even if there should be a storm ♪ Step by step I will walk forward ♪ SINGING WRESTLER MACH FUMIAKE That's not gonna get you anywhere. What did you say? Without your cards, you would've been dead by now. You are pretty good. Ah, you seem to recognize my talents. Huh. What's your name? I'm the fallen angel, Shirasaki Doku. I prefer destruction to creation. Damn! Idiot. What the hell do you think I sent you abroad with all that money for? Now, you are back and blackmailing us for more money. That petty amount won't shut me up. I have... I have killed a man on your orders. Your big mouth got you here. And now it will get you killed. You were nothing but a prison officer... Who helped us a little in that case. You can't keep acting big! Heh, that's not an option. On your orders I killed Yashiro. When you were prison warden I tortured him to death! You're done for. What? Don't lay a finger on me - or you're gonna regret it-- - Shut up! The Yashiro case will become public knowledge. Then your filthy business is over. Kill him. Stop... Please stop! Stop! Please stop! Who are you? Who are you? I don't have much time left. Take this. There they are! - Catch him! - Mach! That's him! Alrighty. Help me out guys! You little snot. I'll kill ya. Damn it! Mach! I'm okay. Where the hell did he go? Where the hell is he? Don't let him escape! Don't just stand there! Chase him! What are you doing here old lady? Um... a labour organisation sent me. What? To serve us tea, eh? We asked for a young lady. How old are you? What? We're asking how old you are! Oh, my husband died 3 years ago. He looked like Gary Cooper. He was so handsome. I guess I'll never find another man like him. So, I guess the interview's over. I shall start from today. - Everyone's here? - Yes, he's waiting in the other room. Damn Nakatani. This evidence is so incriminating! All because of your carelessness. You used to be the warden of a prison. All this trouble for a prison officer. Shame on you! It wasn't as easy as your job. Don't think you can talk big! Remember, I'm the boss here. Well, we've got nothing to worry about - now that we have the photos. - Really? Did you figure out who that intruder was? The boss made me come here because he was worried about this. Tell him that everything's alright. I'll kill that guy the next time I see him! There you go, and to you too... You idiot! Oh, I'm awfully sorry! - Oh, I'm very sorry. - What the hell! Old lady, just get out of here! I'm telling you to get out! Oh, yes surely. Good weather today-- Just get out! Ouch! Hey! That bitch... So how's the plan going? That lady's meant to bring Barbara soon. I see. And then you'll take the box to the boss? There she is! Don't let her get away! Wait! What the hell is this? So they are the ones who framed your father. Onozawa used my father's ship for transporting drugs. He was caught. That's why he blamed it on my father! Why not take this evidence to the police? That won't work for them. We'll do anything for you! Your father did so much for us. Yes! When we were freezing under the cold sky of Hakodate he gave us shelter and raised us. He raised us as if we were his real children. I will never forget what he did for us. The problem is the boss. We only have a picture of his back. Yuko, I've decided to kill Shinobu. How do you feel after betraying your best friend? Thanks to you, I know exactly what Shinobu plans to do next. Betraying the innocent is enjoyable, eh? Yes? Not you. I want to talk to the boss. You idiots! You're not trying hard enough! This person has fooled you twice, And you still don't know who it is. Eh, Onozawa? Odayashiki? I know very well who it is. It's a young woman. She's the car racer, Shinobu Yashiro. She's the daughter of Yashiro a man we killed in prison. Why the hell did you let her take the evidence? Boss, I understand your feelings but we have done our best. You now are a powerful leader of Parliament because of the money from our business. Idiot! Don't talk like that. From a fisherman you became a CEO of Kashihiki factory through my help! Barbara, explain your next job. In three days a billion dollars worth of heroin will be sent to my church. A billion?! Yes. For a long time I've been formulating this drug dealing plan. If this goes well I can not only take over the Japanese drug industry but foreign markets, too. A billion in drugs will net ¥10 billion, or even ¥100 billion. In 5 years, we will be insanely rich. Before that, we must eliminate everyone who's in our way. Kill Shinobu at once. Ooh... this is good. Try it. It will cheer you up! There you go, Shinobu. You used to be a wrestler? Yeah, I was waiting to tell ya! If you're a wrestling fan you'd certainly know my name! - Bacha Mikichi? - Yes! How would she know him? He was famous for not being able to fight even once - despite 15 years of practice! - You didn't have to say that. There are no words to describe the hardships I've endured from not being able to get in the ring. Because of this humiliation I prepared snakes, centipedes, vipers, and frogs, and ate them from head to tail. For the next 24 hours I was so pumped up with energy that I conceived a child with my wife. And what came out of her was Mach Fumiaki! His daughter's Mach Fumiaki the number one female wrestler. We need a description for her other than just "strong." Damn, where did the viper go? I wonder where it went. Oh well, it'll come back. - I'm home! - Oh, there's my viper! Daddy, I won today too! The Mach Special knocked her out. Oh that's awesome! That's my daughter! Shinpei, you're still all skin and bone! Let me introduce you. She's the daughter of my lifesaver, Shinobu Yashiro. I feel like I've seen ya before... Somewhere... Of course! She won the Fuji race just recently. It was in the newspapers. Nah, that ain't it. I feel like I've met her somewhere but I can't remember where... You're Shinobu Yashiro, right? This is from a fan. Thank you very much. See you. So beautiful... You guys did this, didn't you? Go Mach go! Fumiaki! Drink This! Okay, Here I go! Hey, you were at the bar weren't ya? - Sorry for deceiving you. - It's no problem. Former warden, Giichi Otoyashiki! Don't tell me you've never seen me before! I'm the daughter of Yashiro. The man you and Henry Nakatani murdered in prison! You... You... I know that someone ordered you to do this. Who is he? Speak! Damn you... Who do you work for?! Speak! Speak! Saint George... SAINT GEORGE Shinobu, do you think she's okay? Of course. If we search Saint George's Church we can surely find who they work for. Then we'll know where Nagi is too! Nagiko's my only sister. Damn it! Shinpei, please wait here. Keep a close eye on who goes in and comes out of the church. I will search myself for whatever terrifying secret they have in there. May I open the coffin? Thank you ladies for bringing the coffin from abroad. I acknowledge receipt of the goods. I shall send the check to the account at the Swiss bank? What? I see. There are eleven nuns when there are supposed to be ten. There must be a spy in here. I'll check. You! Who are you? Nagiko! Brother! Get off of me! - Brother! - Nagiko! Why are you doing this? - Stop! - Nagiko! Brother! Get off of me! Stop! - Nagiko! - Brother! - Brother! - Nagiko! Nagiko! Please stop! Stop! Stop! Nagiko! That's what you get for trying to help Shinobu. Who are you? Who the hell are you? You don't know me? Aren't you eligible to vote? Read the papers once in a while, for god's sake. You bastard! I'll kill you! I'll kill you! If you want her to be released, kill Shinobu. Stop talking nonsense! Damn you! Or else, she'll have to live in disgrace. Please... Please give me drugs. Ah... Are you in pain Yukiko? - You are my slave. - Please! You are going to live forever as my slave. Oh please... Please Master... Please! Shinpei... Shinpei? Shinpei! Here's your treat. Eat. You aren't eating? Fine. Don't complain if you starve to death. Nagi? Nagi... Nagi! You're Nagi, aren't you? Nagi... Shinobu! He is a devil... He killed my brother! You're okay now. C'mon quickly! Shinobu... As you thought, I gave the order to kill your father, Masayuki Yashiro. When our drug smuggling was detected, Yashiro became suspicious of us. That's why I framed him and sent him to hell. Is it mortifying Shinobu? Soon I'll strip you naked and make you my dog. Bound in chains you'll live here forever as livestock. Shinobu! Shinobu! Shinobu! Yukiko! Shinobu, forgive me. My body and soul belong to him... Yukiko... Your friend Yukiko doesn't exist anymore. Run! Yuko. Yuko! Yukiko! Yukiko! Yuko! She's escaped! Chase after her! Shhh! I work for the JSO. (Japanese Defence Agency) Oh, you work for Maejima Ojisama! Security's tight here. We'll need an escape plan. If we stay here any longer, they'll surround us. There they are! I'll pretend to stab you, so jump. I killed her. Stabbed her in the heart. Good work there, Shirazaki. I don't know why it was so hard for you to kill her. Today's trade will give us absolute advantage. It's with the diplomats and power holders of the underdeveloped countries, yes? - Yes. Be on strict alert. - Oh well. Now that Shinobu is dead we're not going to have much trouble. Is everyone here? The Cambodian envoy hasn't come yet. That's her. She... has money? Cambodian politics are very unstable under the Communist party. They need drugs to stabilise the regime. Oh, welcome Madame Gotanji from Cambodia. Thank you, sister. Thank you. Ladies and Gentleman. Sorry to have kept you waiting. Everybody, please come to next door. I am Inomata. I thank you for coming here today. I hope to forge strong relationships with you all for our mutual well-being and prosperity. So shall we get to business? Please, place your money on the table. Even if I pay you won't be able to bring it to the afterlife, eh? You... Who are you? I'm someone who can guide you To Sanzu River. (River of the dead) Idiotic... Who are you? Can't you tell who I am? We've seen each other so many times. Sometimes a woman gambling. Sometimes a young gentleman. Sometimes a tea-serving old lady. Someimes a nun in a black dress. Or white haired Cambodian woman. And, under the mask, my true self is: The daughter of Masahiro Yashiro who was brutally murdered by you five years ago. Shinobu Yashiro! You... I thought you were dead. I know what you guys are up to! Don't move! Don't move! You... Shirazaki! Your meals were bad... I'm Shirazaki Isaro. Secret agent of the JSO. Boss! - I'll handle this. Go after Minamata! - Yes! Wait for her here! Hurry! There she is. Hell awaits you below! Anyone who disobeys me goes to hell! THE GREAT CHASE - THE END -
