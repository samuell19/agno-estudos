Revolutionary Calendar, year 228. It has been 7 years since Japan was invaded by the Holy Empire of Britannia and renamed Area 11. To combat the spread of Britannian power in western Eurasia, the United Republic of Europia carried out commando raids with Alexanders piloted by Eleven youths. To secure the support of Gen. Smilas, Leila Malcal traveled to General HQ in Paris with Akito Hyuga, but came under attack from Eleven youths who lived in the Paris underground. However, their plan was foiled by Akito singlehandedly. Leila promised to spare the lives of Ryo and his two friends on the condition that they join her wZERO assault unit. In the name of the heavens, the Earth, and the Holy Spirit, I, Duke Velaines, decree the following: That Shin Hyuga Shaing be welcomed as commander of the Holy Order of Michael, one of the Four Great Orders that protects the Empire of Euro-Britannia. Lord Shaing, to me. All hail Britannia! I'm itching with excitement. Master Ashley? If I fight at Lord Shaing's side, I can take the world. I want to see some action soon! The late Manfredi was a friend. He would have never taken his own life. I know that better than anyone. I shall deal with the Ghost of Hannibal. My Order of Michael will restore the honor of your Order of Raphael. Die. Akito, die. Die. No! Die. No! Die! This place has a silence to it that makes the bustle of the city seem like a dream. Revolutionary Calendar, year 228, Prairial the 7th. One month has passed since we returned from Paris to Weiswolf Castle deep in the forest. I have yet to hear from General HQ regarding mission plans. This peaceful time will not last long, I fear. Because I know that days of fighting most certainly lie ahead. Akito... How are things progressing, Joe Wise? Without a hitch. The data transfer from the neuro device should finish on schedule, Dr. Randle. Anna will be glad to hear it. Want a sucker? Not right now. Too bad, they're delicious. How do the EEG's of the other three look? Promising, I think. They're kinda scary, but all three have an AAA compatibility rating. It's amazing. They seem to be a good match for Akito, too. BRS success probability? Around 87%, I'd say. Really? Yeah, they're not even parents or siblings. It's strange. You're right. It is strange. Hey, Ryo. How long do you plan to stick around here? We get free room and board here. It looks like an old castle, but it's high-tech and tidy inside. That's why there's not a rat to be seen. Right, Yukiya? That's right. Ayano, you hate rats, don't you? It's not like you to let somebody put you into a uniform and do nothing! Don't get so worked up. I bet Ayano doesn't like that they took her dagger from her. Damn right I don't! That bitch... or that guy. How could a Japanese be working for-- Yukiya, have you finished setting up our next game? Just about. What are you talking about? Tell me, Ryo! You don't need to know yet, Ayano. Why are you freezing me out-- Ayano. We're happy and content here. Understand? Are you sure it's a good idea to keep those three Elevens, I mean those Former Japanese running loose, sir? Has there been a problem, Major Hammel? They're criminals who attempted to abduct General Smilas. True, under normal circumstances, they'd be felons looking at execution. Then we should let them be brought to justice! Commander Malcal brought them here, saying she wanted to use them. So why not? Gen. Smilas did okay it. If they take any hostile action, it will be difficult to subdue them with just my special forces team. Don't worry so much. The security system here is ridiculously elaborate. Besides, we need people like them here. People who won't be missed if they die. I'm sick of the simulators. They're comfy. They're better than that other thing that spins you around. Yeah, you puked in that one, Ayano. I'm prone to motion sickness! A cat? Oh, I get it. May I offer my congratulations on your son's success. The Shaing family's position is now secure. Thank you, Earl Orleans. We owe it all to the late Sir Manfredi. Come to think of it, where is the party's guest of honor? Now that you mention it, I haven't seen him for a while. Alice, Mother is worried. Sister, wait! I hate these parties. I don't know a single person at them. Brother, take me on a long drive to the coast tomorrow. Please, Brother. Promise me, Brother. Tomorrow is the Order of Michael's review ceremony. It is? I won't be able to return for some time. But I give my word that I will spend my leave days with you, Alice. Wonderful! Yes? Sorry for calling so late, Commander. I didn't wake you up, did I? No, I was up. Oh, you were? Operation orders were just delivered from HQ. I'll bring them over right away. You can unseal them there. Another damn suicide mis-- I mean, we've been tasked with another difficult mission, Commander Malcal. This says that they're moving up the Warsaw garrison force, but they're for internal matters. That latest public opinion poll must've rattled the government bigwigs something fierce. If they keep the eyes of the populace distracted outwards, they'll be able to cover their own butts for the time being. Is that why they're having the Wyvern Squad drop inside enemy lines? Well, to be blunt, they're to be decoys. Or sacrificial pawns, I suppose. They don't have the manpower they need to carry out the mission! You mean to say that you can't simply disobey orders? You do know that sound reasoning isn't going to help you, don't you? I suppose you have no choice. If you really do want those Elevens to come back in one piece, it's the commander's duty to think of a way to make it happen. Lt. Hyuga. Thank you for agreeing to come. You ordered me to come, so I came. There's no need for pleasantries. Ah. Of course, you're right. Please take a seat. Would you like some tea? This tea has a lovely aroma. Is this about those three? Yes. I hoped to get your opinion on the matter, Lieutenant. Be my guest. Do you believe they will continue to behave and go into battle, Commander? I believe they have accepted their situation. That's what you want to see, Commander. It isn't reality. They can't leave here and support themselves. Because they are criminals... as well as Elevens? I only meant-- It's all right. Let's speak only the unvarnished truth. I don't want to waste time. I expect that they also know what you have in mind, Commander. In which case... you can be sure that they will rebel against you. I know about the drones. I admit that I prefer the idea of using unmanned machines in combat. But I don't think that current AI can live up to your expectations, Leila. They have to be able to react instantly to their targets, right? Artificial intelligence like that isn't technologically feasible now. Being in the military is a lot tougher than I was expecting, right, Sgt. Hilda? I thought it would be a cushy civil service job, Sgt. Chloe. 'Cause the boss is so enthusiastic. If we get to make a career of it, I wonder if we can make Technical Officer? We cut the time down by 0.05 seconds! A new record! Looks like that 25D unit worked like a charm. Chloe, Hilda, is the upload complete yet? Yes, Boss! We're running the final checks now! It's working really well. It's all thanks to Akito's data. I'm glad to hear it. It looks like this will let us roll out the Type 02. Ayano, what time is it? 3:02. It's 3 already? Ryo, are you hungry? You're hopeless. Want to head down to the cafeteria, then? Nah, the snacks there are terrible. Then hold out until dinner. Yeah, I guess I'll try to tough it out until dinner. It's for the best. We have simulator training again later. If you eat like a pig, you'll puke. Got it. We're clear. Attaboy, Yukiya! Okay, then... Let's get started! Major Hammel. Anything unusual to report? Don't take your eyes off the new Wyvern recruits. We know, sir. There's been nothing new to report so far, though. They even keep THAT a secret? You've always been a workaholic, Leila. You need to unwind sometimes. We can't let this beautiful garden go to waste, can we? This feels wonderful! Hm? Look at that, Leila. What is it, Anna? Up there. On the ledge. Isn't that Eliza? Eliza! I managed to hack into the server. The security camera keeps showing us in this room. Also... I tweaked the data on these. I loaded them with fake data that will let us pass through their security. How on earth did she get out of my room? There's a passage in here? Welcome back, Akito Hyuga. A handmade bomb, eh? Stop right there. Akito, you're too dangerous to live. So die with me here. What's the deal? There aren't any Knightmares in here! These are cockpits? They're down there, huh? You give off the same smell as me, you know that? Let's have a chat before we die. Get it over with, or the special forces squad will show up. They're not a problem. They're watching a virtual reality I constructed. But enough about them. Look at this. Look at this. Interesting, isn't it? I have lots of scars on my back, too. How do you think I got them? I couldn't care less. Don't be like that! Have a little fun! You're about to die, after all. You're a tough audience. Whatever, I'll throw it in free of charge. It was three years ago, in Amsterdam's Japanese ghetto. The adults' sense of inferiority and discontent had also infected the youth. They preyed on those weaker than them to vent that dissatisfaction. Japanese persecuted other Japanese. The world was better off without them, so I took care of them with a bomb. That's why I don't give a rat's ass about Japanese. About Elevens. I escaped from the ghetto, and to avoid the police, I entered the world of the underground. That's where I met Ryo and his group. For the first time, I found friends that I could trust. I found a family. Which is why I won't let any more of them die. I'm going to protect them. What makes you so sure that you won't come back if you go into battle? I did. That's a real mystery. Some rumors say you used your squadmates as human shields. In that case, come with me. Then you'll know for sure. There are three of you. And only one of me. I hadn't thought of that. That's true. Akito, you're an interesting guy. There aren't gonna be any communications cables out here in the forest! Yukiya, you jerk! Are you returning to the castle? What are the other two up to? I'm on your side! Give me a break! You're going to use us as your disposable pawns! I am not! I've been thinking of a way to ensure that you come back-- That's crap! You're always where it's nice and safe! How many have died so far? How many Elevens have died in your operations?! I won't let anyone else die. I'm going into battle with you. Damn it! Yes? Do you read me, Commander? It's Lt. Col. Warwick. What is it? I see that you're on your way to the launch site. Has anything happened with the Elevens? No, nothing. About that, ma'am. Our monitor feed from their room just cut out all of a sudden. I know what caused it. You do, ma'am? I'll explain later. I need to hang up. Ma'am, wait-- What the hell is that? Wait, this is a-- An ultra-long range, extra-atmospheric transport. We'll conduct commando raids by using this new weapon to drop behind enemy lines. Ah, I get it. Those are Knightmares? You expect us to fly off in that and die, huh? Since this is a war, returning alive will never be a 100% certainty. Nevertheless, I'd like us all to return safely. "Us"? Are you saying that you're coming along? Yes. If you really mean that, you either have a naive personality or are a fool. As the one who proposed this operation, I intend to fulfill my obligation to ensure that everyone comes home safely. I don't believe that to be foolish. Mark my words, you'll regret it. Sir Kururugi, we'll be arriving in St. Petersburg in 12 hours. I see. How is the Military Advisor feeling? He's fine. You may go. Yes, my lord! Suzaku... Would you... Would you get me some water? I'm begging you... Get me water... Get me water... Water... ...82, 81, 480. Eight minutes to liftoff. Launch countdown has begun. All systems nominal. Now, then... Let's see how far the little lady can take this. Of course, if she comes back in one piece, that's a success. Joe Wise, are you done calibrating the BRS program yet? Just a little more. I'll have it done before the launch. 59, 58... Hilda, how much longer until the Type 02 upload is complete? 45 seconds. That's cutting it close! All systems now switched over from external to internal power. An order's been issued for all forces to prepare for battle, eh? We begin our advance one hour after Apollo's Chariot launches. Well, our duty is just to carry out the orders of Joint Staff HQ. Make sure not to go above and beyond the letter of the orders. We shouldn't be made to take the fall for it if the operation fails. This op, Operation Gamma, is to assist the main EU force that's stationed in Warsaw. They will march on Area 24A of the Eastern front. Our Wyvern Squad will drop behind the Britannian forces that are deployed in that area and conduct a commando raid. This will throw the enemy into disarray, and the 103rd Corps will make a frontal attack. You expect us to drop right into the enemy's lap? This certainly sounds like an op that uses Elevens. Don't be so pessimistic. If you meet up with the advancing 103rd, you'll come home safe. With enemy forces in all directions? We have to live that long first. You Former Japanese youngsters sure are negative Nellies. All right, allow me to deliver slightly happier news. The commander herself will take part in this operation. Leila, are you serious? A commando raid will be ineffective unless sufficient troops are committed. Unfortunately, we have only a handful of personnel to allocate to this operation. To bolster those numbers, I've decided to employ drones. However, an operator is needed to control those drones. For that reason, I am going to go into battle with you. That guy, he...! Ayano, you should catch some sleep. It's not like we'll have anything to do for a while. You have a point. And if you're asleep, you won't be afraid when you die. T-minus one minute to liftoff. Activate drive batteries. Flight mode on. 56, 55, 54, 53... 10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5... All systems ready for launch! Main engine start! Go, baby, go... 35, 36... 78, 79, 180... T-plus three minutes! Primary engine burn nominal. Control systems and flight path both nominal. Altitude, 108km. Velocity, 2.2km/s. Apollo's Chariot is continuing to fly smoothly. Primary engine burn complete! Separate first stage rocket! First stage rocket separation successful. Secondary engine, begin burn! Altitude, 255km... Velocity, 5.6km/s... Apollo's Chariot, secondary engine burn complete. Inertial guidance operating properly. Now here comes the hard part. This isn't too bad as last sights go. To think there are people down there... I wish I could squash them. It's beautiful. God, I'm bored. Bored, bored... How long are we gonna have to stay cooped up in the musty dump?! Joannes! Yes, Master Ashley! We have some time on our hands, so let's play a little game. Joannes, to survive on the battlefield, what is the one thing you need to have? T-The skill to emerge victorious. What's with that lame answer? Listen closely. The absolutely crucial thing on a battlefield is luck. Even with skill and effort, when you happen to lose, you lose and you die. Why is that? It's because you didn't have any luck. But I'm not like that. I'll show you the proof right now. Master Ashley! Please stop! See? I won't die. Pathetic. To think that you believe in luck. I wouldn't have pegged you for a romantic, Ashley Ashra. Jean Rowe! Okay, then, I'm gonna check to see if you have any luck! How about it? Feeling confident? This is bad. Private disputes are punishable by death! Please stop this, Master Ashley! Stay back! Stay where you are and watch. See what Jean's luck is like. Looks like you have a pretty healthy dose of luck yourself. That's enough of your stupid games. But I always get bored in places like this! In that case, you won't be bored for long. Lord Shaing wants to see you, Ashley Ashra. My Ashra Force is going into battle! Thirty seconds to fairing separation. This is gonna work... I hope. Leila... System shows all clear! Commencing separation! Capsule separation confirmed. System activation confirmed. All units show green. Finally... We're free falling from 300 kilometers, Ayano! I know that! 20 seconds to reentry! 10 seconds to capsule reentry! Wing deployment successful! Got it! This is a piece of cake! They opened! Did it! I'm being blown off course! Everything went smoothly in the simulation... All drones confirmed. Warrant Officers Sayama, Naruse, and Kosaka, report your location. In a war, commanders sometimes get killed first, you know? Lt. Hyuga! Make sure you capture them unharmed! I'm not sure I can. Safe landing of all Wyverns confirmed! Beginning deploy-- Huh? They're already exchanging fire? Have they been spotted already? Isn't this friendly fire? It sure seems that way from this telemetry. Yukiya, target Hyuga from behind! It's kind of a waste to kill him here, isn't it? Lt. Hyuga! Yukiya, what are you doing?! Hurry! Fine, fine... What's all this? Could somebody tell me what's going on? It's probably enemy bombardment! Multiple heat sources! Shells impacting at the Wyverns' drop point! Seriously? Where's the fire coming from? Large-caliber cannons not detected! High-altitude observation balloon, data lost! I've lost Wyvern Squad's coordinates! Can't you do a trajectory calculation? Calculation complete! 500km to the east-northeast! 500 kilometers?! Sara, are you sure you ran those numbers right? I'm sure! They're correct! So they're using ultra-long range cannons, huh? Our Britannian buddies had a clever idea, too, didn't they? If we bear north-northwest, we'll get clear of the impact zone. A Britannian Knightmare squad, huh? I'll settle things with you once we've made it out of here alive! I wish you'd make up your mind. Ayano! Try to keep up! As you predicted, Lord Hyuga. The Ghost of Hannibal are now headed towards Slonim. And Ashley and his team? In position, as per your orders. Jean, prepare my Vercingetorix. You're going to go into battle yourself, sir? I want to see who these ghosts are with my own two eyes. Why is it empty? This isn't good. This place gives me the creeps. I think it's gonna be fun. Nothing good ever comes of it when you say "fun", Yukiya. Drone deployment confirmed. All that's left now is-- An ambush? Commander, don't leave my side. Lt. Hyuga! We need to ensure that you don't die before all your drones are used up. Understood. I'll do my best to make it home alive with the rest of you. These are the Ghost of Hannibal? Uh-oh, it's the enemy! This is a-- There are drones mixed in with the Ghost of Hannibal! There's no sign of the enemy. They're close. Ayano, above you! Rene, Franz! I've located the Ghost of Hannibal! Master Ashley! Most of the enemy Knightmares are drones! The reality of the Ghost of Hannibal doesn't live up to the hype. Enemy units heading your way, Master Ashley! I was getting sick of waiting! Commander, can you call the drones over here? The remaining three-- two drones are currently engaging the enemy. We'll force our way through, then. Stick close to me. Lt. Hyuga! Commander! Commander, get clear. A red Knightmare... Okay, let's get to killing! I see the other one! Lt. Hyuga... Die... Die... Die... Master Ashley! Die! What? What was that?! Akito? What's causing this spike? Die! Die! Die! The Ashra Force won't be beaten by the likes of you! Die! Die! Die! Are these things real ghosts? Die! Check the values of all pilots' neuro devices, Kate! There's a signal backflow in Sayama, Kosaka, and Naruse's neuro devices! The brainwaves of all four have begun to sync. They're networked? Die! I can see you! Die! What are these things?! Ferilli! Kate! Can you confirm on your end? Yes, ma'am! Confirmed! And you? No doubt about it! No, wait... Doesn't this mean they're syncing with Akito? Joe Wise! Give me a minute! Um, what's going on, Dr. Randle? Ask me later! Joe Wise, get me data! Y-Yes, ma'am! The Ashra Force can't beat a bunch of Europian pipsqueaks?! The Ashra Force's formation is breaking down. By lowly Europian Knightmares... What cowards. Jean, you talk too much. My apologies, Lord Hyuga. Those Knightmares are most interesting. Do you see what I see, Jean? No, I'm not quite... I sense it... So, you're alive. This is bad! This guy is dangerous! This is not good! Those guys are dangerous! Lt. Hyuga! Please respond! Someone! W. O. Kosaka! W. O. Sayama! W. O. Naruse! Someone answer me! Mental clouding intensifying! If this keeps up, their ego boundaries will break down! Akito's nervous system is co-opting those of Sayama, Naruse, and Kosaka via their neuro devices. A brain raid! I'm taking a pounding! Simon, eject! Franz! We're not about to lose to inferiors like you! Die! Damn monster! He's tough... You damn angel of death! You aren't a ghost! You're either a demon or angel of death! Die! Die! Die! Master Ashley! J-Joannes? Master Ashley... Good luck to you. Die, Akito! Who was that? Why are you still alive? Big brother... Die! What the hell is this?! That kid, it's-- I feel sick! A Malamud flash! Ego boundaries restoring! Mental backlash incoming! Ashley. Withdraw. Lord Shaing, allow me to handle this! Silence. Fall back to the rear lines, Ashley. Yes, my lord... That Knightmare... Akito. I can't believe you're alive. And a Europian soldier, to boot. It can't be. When I'm exposed like this, even you could kill me, Akito. Brother... "Brother"? But he's a Britannian knight... Hyuga? Akito? Now I see. The gods allowed you to live for my sake. For my great cause. Akito. Take the blood oath with my Order of Michael. And then offer up your life for the creation of a new world. Brother, are you telling me to... That's right. I want you to die. For my sake. Is that any way to talk to your own little brother?! Hyuga! Get away from that guy! Interrupting the joyous reunion of two brothers? Your squadmates have no manners, Akito. Akito! Stay back! Get away! Lord Hyuga, the 2nd Field Army seems to have disobeyed orders and sent reinforcements here. Those fools. Akito. I shall come for you. Mark my words. Lord Hyuga, I will cover you. Jean, that's enough of your jokes. Akito! Are you okay? Yeah. That guy, was he your-- Yeah. He was my... ...big brother. 242nd Regiment has crossed the front lines and is advancing! You're, uh, sure about this, right? Yes, sir! Enemy forces are retreating! Operation 237-A17 is 30 minutes behind schedule, but is being carried out according to plan! Seriously? We actually pulled it off... Confirmation of successful reclamation of Slonim into allied territory! Message from Command! Wyvern Squad members all present and accounted for! Thank goodness, Leila... This calls for a celebration tonight. By myself. It was exactly as you said. I was able to confirm a BRS event. Our theory is now one step closer to being proven. And it was all thanks to you. Good night. Sweet dreams. Hanging around directionless youngsters is pretty tough. I'm not exactly a kid anymore. A job like this is gonna work me into an early grave... You must be worn out from your long journey. I will send you to the Guest of State residence right away. It's a pleasure to meet you, Sir Kururugi. Allow me to welcome you on behalf of His Highness Grand Duke Velaines. I am Michael Augustus. Kururugi. The Imperial Family's private train, and a Knight of the Round as his escort? The gentleman with you must be highly regarded by his Imperial Majesty. What's this? This is all the welcome I get? Nevertheless, when next I return, the streets of St. Petersburg will be lined with the masses cheering my victory and chanting my name. By order of His Imperial Majesty, all Eastern front operational planning will hereby be conducted by me, Military Advisor Julius Kingsley! They say they didn't last even 30 minutes! Wow, the front lines are scary! I couldn't handle it on the front lines. The rear lines, that's where it's at! Maybe I'll ask for a desk job. I put in a request for leave. You're lucky, man. I'm jealous. Are those people idiots?! They got carried away and deployed their troops, but, in the end, they were driven back, and even Slonim was regained by the enemy. Our lives got put on the line for those people! What's so funny?! You remind of Akito somehow. That guy... How did it go, Commander? We've been authorized to use a transport to return home the day after tomorrow. The day after tomorrow? Yes. Apparently, General Smilas arranged for it. Shall we go back, Commander? Of course. Um, Lieutenant, may I ask you something? That Britannian knight... Is it true that he's your brother? That man and I were separated over ten years ago. I hadn't seen him until today. But you are brothers, right? The fact that we're brothers, that the same blood runs in our veins, is exactly why he wants to kill me. Kill you? If you're brothers, there has to be a way for you to reach an understanding. So you-- I died once. That's why I'm going to return the favor and kill him this time.
