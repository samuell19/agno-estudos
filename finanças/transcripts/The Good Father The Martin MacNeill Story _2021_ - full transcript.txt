It is such a pleasure to bestow the honor of Sunday School Teacher of the Year Award to my father. I know what a good teacher he is because he taught me everything he knows. Now some of you know him as the respected Director at the Utah Care Clinic, some of you know him as your primary physician, and some of you know him as the unbeatable adversary on the golf course. You'll lose someday, Martin. And some of you know him as a decorated Veteran, who graduated cum laude from both medical and law school, but I'll always know him as dad. Come on up here and accept this award, Dad. How about my daughter, Alexis? Mark my words, she'll be twice the doctor I am when she finishes medical school. So proud of you. I share this with all my kids, and with the woman who taught me to be a teacher and a husband and a father, my gorgeous wife, Michele. I love you and I always will. Thank you. Come on. I have to swing by the office. Yeah, I'll just be a minute, honey, I promise. Hey guys, thanks so much for the very special day! The next party, you got to keep up with your old man on the dance floor. It's okay, mom, I'll help put the girls to bed. Hey. Well, I just wanted to let you know that the girls are finally asleep. Teeth are brushed and flossed. I'm just doing a load of laundry now. Okay, can you please never go back to school? I love you, Mom. Goodnight. Lexi, you know your dad's work better than anyone. Why is he there on a Sunday night? Um, he's probably reviewing patient files. Yeah. It's just that he's disappearing all the time. What's going on? You're in Nevada, and you're away, you don't see how different he is, and he's never here anymore, and he's always going to the gym. Well, you know Dad, he always likes to look good. I know I shouldn't talk to you about this, but I don't feel like I have anywhere else to go. I think your dad's having an affair. You don't seriously think that? I don't know, his phone's always ringing and he's leaving the room to go answer it. Well have you considered that those are his patients calling? He has to keep those calls confidential. You're right. I just wish... Mom, dad loves you. I just wish I knew for sure. Can you access his phone records for me? Mom, now you're sounding... Crazy. No, just a little paranoid. Oh great. Well, I think your health is good. What do you think, Alexis? I think increased cardiovascular exercise, a diet low in fat, high in fibre and omega 3's. This is a patient with an emergency, so I'm gonna take it. I'll be right back. You're in great hands with Alexis. Hey, maybe. Ah, I'll have to move some things around. Mom. Yeah. Uh. So many of these calls are in the middle of the night, you don't want me to be suspicious? There has to be an explanation, Mom. You just need to ask dad. No, we need to ask him. Please. Tonight. Okay, fine. But you'll see that I'm right. I'm flattered, honestly, that you would even think someone would want to have an affair with an old man like me. Then who is she, hmm, Jullian Willis? You've been looking at my phone records? I had Alexis help me. I only did it to prove to Mom that she is worrying for no reason. But then we found all of these phone calls. I told you, Mom, there's got to be an explanation, right, Dad? Tell her. She's a tenant. She rents the house in Lehigh. I thought the Garcia's were there. They left two months ago, so I started renting to Jullian Willis and her friends. Why are you on the phone with each other after midnight? She's a nursing student. She's doing her residency. Lexi, tell her what those hours are like. Yeah, see, I told you, Mom. Okay, well that explains the phone records, but it doesn't explain the disappearances. I was hoping I wouldn't have to tell you this. What's going on? They found something on my foot. What is it? It's, it's cancer, it's melanoma. Why wouldn't you tell me? I don't want you two worrying about me. Besides, between my work schedule and raising all our kids, when would I have time to cheat? ♪♪ There's a lover in my life ♪ ♪ He sends me gifts and flowers ♪ ♪ He'd change a thousand gloves ♪ ♪ Meet me after hours ♪ ♪ He's crazy, yeah ♪ ♪ Yeah, he's ♪ Does this mean you're taking dance classes again? ♪ crazy about ♪ Um, you want to join me? ♪ our love ♪♪ Well, I actually have to shadow dad again at the clinic this morning, so I just wanted to get some studying in before breakfast. No, I don't mind if you spend the morning with your mom, yeah. I have a doctor's appointment of my own, anyway, before work. Please, don't make that face. Don't worry about me. I'm gonna be fine. Well, I would love for you to join me if you're open to that. Besides, I have some exciting news. Is it good news? I think so. I'm getting a face lift. A face lift? Why? You'll understand when you're older. You know, a lot of women get work done at my age. Yeah, and a lot of women your age don't, like those French women you love so much. You say that they age so well. I don't have their genetics. You look as pretty as you did when you won Miss Concord, Mom. Lexi, I'm 50, and, you know, with your Dad looking so good, I might as well, too. You're not doing this because you think Dad wants it, right? He may have suggested it. But no, I'm, I'm doing for me, not for him. Well, there are serious medical risks, Mom. Hematoma and scarring and nerve injury. Lexi, I'm married to a doctor, I know that there are risks. Can I please just have your love and support? Yeah, you're always gonna have that. Thank you. Now I want you to count backwards from 10 for me. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five... Look, I know we discussed this yesterday, but are you sure she needs all of this? Solpadine, Oxycodone, acetaminophen, diazepam, cephalexin, Hydrocodone Bitartrate. You don't know my wife. That is a pretty aggressive regime, Dad. She doesn't need to take it all, but we need to have it on hand. She's a very anxious person. She didn't sleep the whole week leading up to the operation. She needs sleep to heal. That's true. My love, you look beautiful. Mm-hmm, you're a terrible liar. Aren't you glad you married a bad liar. Funny. Thank you, Lexi. Comfy cozy. Isn't this nice for your recovery? Nothing feels nice. That's what the meds are for. You don't think we should have kept her in the hospital a little longer? And leave her vulnerable to some deadly staph infection? I always have my patients leave the hospital as soon as possible. It's true. She also has a doctor and a med student at her disposal. Ohhh! Uhh! Okay, okay, hon, here's a glass of water. It hurts. I know. These will help. Here you go, take two of these at a time. Mm-hmm. Go ahead. There you go. Two more. There. Can you stay with her? I have a doctor's appointment. Of course. Rest up. Hmm. Help me. Help me! Mom. Oh! Are you okay? No. No, no, no, lie down, lie down. You just had surgery, Mom. It's gonna feel a little worse before it feels better. Oh! I can get you something. No more, no more. Mm-mm. You're right, you have taken enough. Oh, it hurts... I know. So much. Where is your dad? I don't know. Mm. Is that better? Mmm. You're healing perfectly. Do you want to take a look? Mm, I think I want to take a bath before I see my new self. Lexi, can you help her? I have to go to work. Of course. I'm gonna have to go back to Nevada soon, now that you're back up on your feet. I wish you didn't have to go. Your Dad, I feel like something's still going on. Come on, Mom, between his work and his diagnosis, taking care of you and the girls, when does he have the time? You're right. And he is being really sweet lately. I'm gonna be done with classes soon, and then we'll have the whole summer as a family together. The girls are really gonna miss you. Not as much as I'll miss them. We are so lucky that we adopted them. Mm-hmm. Do you really think that Dad would risk losing a family that you both worked so hard to create? Of course not. And I have you to thank for helping me realize that. This is gonna feel good. Call as soon as you land. I will. You okay, Dad? It's just with the cancer, I've been thinking about, you know, what would happen to you all if I were gone. You said they caught it early. Listen, don't minimize it for my sake. I know Mom can't handle bad news, but I'm not her. I know, that's why I need you to promise if anything happens to me, you'll take care of your Mom and the girls. Dad, nothing's gonna happen to you, okay. Okay? Bye sweetheart. Bye, I love you! Lexi, I can't talk right now. Listen to my messages. What? Why? I got to keep the line open. Dad, what's happening? Just get on a flight, it's your Mom. Answering machine: Hi, you've reached the MacNeill clan. Leave a message. It's me, Dad. I'm on my way. I'm just checking in on Mom. Lexi, she's gone. Gone, what do you mean? What do you mean gone? I'm so sorry. I don't... I don't under... What? No! No, she can't be gone! No, she's can't be gone! I don't understand. Lexi, don't! She's not even up there! Lexi, wait! This doesn't make any sense. She was fine when I left. I know. Where are all of her medications? The police took them. Why? Do they think she did this to herself? Of course not, it was an accident. Lexi, don't go in there. I was just pouring her a bath. Come on, let's go downstairs. What happened? I don't think you should... Please, Dad, just tell me what happened. I just picked Jamie up from school. She ran upstairs to look for her Mom. Please don't tell me Jamie found her. She was slumped over the tub. Her head was underwater, submerged. I told Jamie, "Go next door. Get help." I think she fell in trying to put the plug in. She had a gash on her head. I struggled trying to pull her out. I tried giving her CPR, but it was no use and... I didn't call 911 until I got her out of the water. Maybe if I'd made the call before I got her out. Oh, Lexi. You cannot blame yourself. Who... who else can I blame? Did you go to the hospital? Were you at the hospital? Of course. I was screaming at them to keep working on Michele, even when they called it. I yelled at them not to stop. I need to see her. No, Lexi. Please, Dad, I need to see her. I'm sorry, I'm sorry, Mom. I shouldn't have left you. I'm sorry to be the messenger, I truly am. And I know how important closure can be for grief, but you may never know exactly what happened. Natural causes, just like the medical examiner said. I, I thought it might have been a pulmonary embolism, a blood clot related to the surgery. This just leaves me with more questions than answers. Hearing the results of an autopsy can be very difficult. What about the toxicology report? It's unlikely to change the findings of the autopsy. This was just a terrible accident. Come on, girls, get your lunches. Don't forget your backpacks in the car. Bye Dad. Bye Dad. Can you hand me my raincoat? Bye. I just hope we don't end up burying Mom before we get the toxicology report. It's our last hope of finding out what really happened to her. Sweetie, we know what happened. I know. Maybe we can just push them to speed it up or something. Of course, I'll make some calls. Thanks. Lexi, I know it's hard to let go, but your Mother's death was a tragic accident. Okay. What is it? I'm looking for your Mom's old address book. Is everything okay? Yeah, I need to call the Millers, let them know what happened. The Millers? I haven't heard their name in years. They were very fond of your Mom. Okay, sorry. You know what, I, I might know where it is. Okay. Did you find it? No, but I found this prescription in Olivia's name. You prescribed it. She's 13. I didn't know she had ADD. What? They're not for her, they're for me. Why would you prescribe it to her? This is gonna be on her medical record. I know. I'm sorry. Stupid. I just don't feel the same since my cancer diagnosis. My energy is sapped. I, I want to care for my patients, I want to care for you kids. Does your doctor know that you're taking these? No, I'm too ashamed to admit that I need them. I know how people see me. I want to be the superhero, and I just don't want to ask for help. I know. Yeah, we're the same that way. But we need to ask for help. You're right. Sorry. I do think I need some help around the house. The kids are a full time job. I don't know how your Mom did it. I'll stay as long as I can. No, I, I'm gonna hire a nanny. No, just let me stay, you don't need to hire a nanny. No, you're not gonna sacrifice your life for your sisters, you're gonna finish medical school, and meet a man and live your life. What, what's so funny? I don't know, do you think that there's a man out there that's worthy of me? The jury is out on that. But that's family. Do you think your Mother's family thought I was worthy of her? Not at all. Your grandmother thought I was bad news, and your Aunt Linda didn't trust me one bit. Right, thanks. Can I help you? My name is Linda Cluff. My sister, Michele MacNeill, died recently. I'd like to speak to whoever is handling her case. I'm no stranger to tragedy. Many of you know the difficulties I faced as a child. My Mother left me, my Father wasn't equipped to take care of himself, let alone a child, and yet, I persevered, with the help of my faith. I spent the last few days praying, asking what have I done to deserve this? What have my children done? All I can do is keep moving on, and hope that something good comes out of Michele's death. I'm sorry. I don't have the strength right now to go on. Hi girls. Hi, Aunt Linda. I love you. Bye. Lexi, hey. Hi Linda. How are you holding up? I'm not gonna lie, I've been better. Nothing compared to what you must be going through. Well, I've been so busy with the funeral arrangements that I really haven't had any time to grieve. I know it's gonna hit me soon, and I'm not looking forward to that. I'll be there when it does. Do you know who that is? No, um, but Mom had a lot of friends. Listen, I know that right now might not be a good time, but it's about your father. There are things that you don't know about him. I'm sorry, Aunt Linda, do you mind if we talk about this later? There's just so many people to greet. There is something about your father that I think that you should know. I hesitated to tell you, but it- Linda, I know he has cancer. You know he tells me everything. He just didn't want to worry the girls. Lexi. Please, let's talk later, okay. Long day? Yeah. Well, the girls are finally tucked away to bed. They were a handful tonight. So you can relax. Oh, this is why we need a nanny. What am I gonna do when you go back to medical school? Easy, I'll stay. No, no, I put up signs everywhere, all over town, all over the clinic. Signs for a nanny? Mm-hmm. No, you're not gonna find someone that way. Just let me stay, let me help. Out of the question. How hard can it be to find a qualified nanny? Well, I'm sure it's not that easy. And Dad, the Dean of Students, he gave me permission to take two weeks off. During the exams? Yeah, he said that I could postpone my exams, extenuating circumstances. No, no, two weeks becomes two years, and then there goes your dream of becoming a doctor. I am not gonna let that happen! I'm not gonna give up on becoming a doctor. I told you when I was a little girl that I would follow in your footsteps. I'm not about to turn my back on that dream. Fine, we'll give it a few days, and if I don't find a nanny, you can stay two weeks, but that's it. You're not putting your life on hold because of me. Okay. Okay. Deal. Deal. I used to like being looked at, it made me feel special, people respected me. Now all I see is pity in their eyes. This community cares about you, Dad. They're just grieving with us. That doesn't mean they don't respect you. Hmm, maybe you're right. Dr. MacNeill. Hi, um, I don't know if you remember me. You treated me for a fractured ankle a few years ago. Oh yes, you have an unforgettable name. An unforgettable name that he forgot. I'm Alexis. I'm his daughter. Hi, nice to meet you, I'm Gypsy. Gypsy, that's it. Yes. Were you at my mom's funeral? Me, no, though I did hear of her passing, and I am so sorry. Thank you. She sounds like an amazing woman. I actually don't live here anymore. I moved back to be a nanny for a family and then they changed their minds, didn't even give me any notice, so. A nanny? Yeah. Well, God works in mysterious ways. What, what's going on? Is there a joke I'm not in on? Not a joke, maybe a job offer. Really? Well, we'd need to see some references, of course. Of course. Yes, of course. Wow! I still don't understand why we're rushing into things. Rushing? I checked all her references just like you wanted. They all raved about her. Don't you want the girls to be well taken care of? They are well taken care of. That's because you're here, but that's not permanent. Well, she's punctual, I'll give her that. Lexi, I know this is a big change, but please, trust me. I always have. Hi. There are more fresh towels in the bathroom. Thanks. The girls are all asleep now, so you'll meet them in the morning. They're gonna need a lot of love and attention. Jamie has nightmares, and she had them before she found Mom, so you can imagine how much worse they'll be. Okay. Well, I just give her a glass of warm milk and read her a bedtime story, a happy one, which is surprisingly hard to find. Why are kids stories so gruesome? I don't know. I just thought you'd have an opinion as a nanny. Right. Well since you'll be driving the girls, I'm gonna need to see all of your information. Can I see your driver's license and your car insurance, too? I went over all that with your Dad when he hired me. I don't really want to bother him right now, but I do need to see it. Sure. Thank you. I'll let you get settled in. You must be tired. Goodnight. Hello. Linda, it's Lexi. What you wanted to tell me about Dad, it wasn't about his cancer, was it? No. In fact, I, um, I did some digging with friends at the clinic after you told me that, and he doesn't have cancer. I'll be right over. Look, all I know is that Mom suspected him of having an affair with this woman named Jillian Willis, and now she's living in our house with us as a nanny. It's hard to believe. Not for me, it isn't. He's always given me the creeps. His voice, his, his mannerisms, like he was always trying to impress. Yeah, but isn't that like every guy who's meeting his girlfriend's parents though? Maybe, but then Michele came home from a date one night, and she told me that he pulled a gun and said he would kill himself if she didn't marry him. What? We warned her, but she didn't listen. She loved him. I, I don't know why, but she did. I, I know why, because when he shines his light on you, it's like you're the only person who matters. I wouldn't know. He's never shined his light on me. One night we had a big fight, and I told him to leave my sister alone, and Martin said, "She's my wife." They had eloped. Mom was beside herself, but that's when we started looking into things. We always knew that he had been in some trouble, but he told your Mom he'd just written some bad checks. No, it was more. He was stealing dead people's identities. Opening bank accounts in their names. He served time in federal prison for check fraud. How did you find all this? I've been an insurance adjuster in this State for a long time. I know a lot of lawyers. Did Mom know about this? Your father explained it away, said it was a mistake, blamed it on his childhood. But he did, he did have a rough childhood. Come on, you don't think he's lying about his parents? I wouldn't know, sweetie. I've never met anyone from his past. I don't know what to believe. All I know is that your father has always been able to charm his way out of anything. Your mother always believed in him. Even the police don't want to investigate him. You went to the police? I wanted to give them this folder. I thought maybe they would see some connection between his past life. Wait, my Dad has made some mistakes, but you don't think he had anything to do with my Mom's death? Why didn't you tell me any of this earlier? Because you're his daughter, and the apple of his eye. I didn't want to rob you of that. And I never thought that he would hurt anyone. I really didn't. I, I wanted to be wrong about him. Okay, let's talk this through. Yes, he might have been having an affair, but men do that. That doesn't mean he hurt Mom, okay. Whatever my Dad did, he wouldn't do that because he loved her, and he loves us. I just, I can't believe that. You're doing what Michele did, justifying his actions, finding a way to continue loving him. I always thought of you as being more like your dad, but seeing the best in people, that's something you have in common with your Mother. Where have you been? I was worried. I slept at Aunt Linda's. She says hello. I'm sure she said more than hello. She loves sharing her crazy ideas about me. You should hear some of the things she told your Mother. The only crazy thing, Dad, is you pretending not to know Jillian Willis, before inviting her into our home. She prefers to be called Gypsy. Mom was right, wasn't she? You're involved with her. Your Mother thought I was having an affair with everyone, including my boss at the clinic. I mean can you imagine? You're just trying to make her sound paranoid. How would you know? You left this family to go to medical school. Because you encouraged me. Well you weren't here to see how lost your Mom became. She was always in that bedroom just dreaming up new accusations. They're not accusations if they're true! They're all lies! And anything your Aunt Linda told you is a lie, I promise you. Your Mom's family always had it out for me. Were you arrested for check fraud? Lexi. Don't answer that, Dad, because I already know that. And how did you walk over here without your cane? Because you seemed to need that at the funeral. Lexi, stop, this won't help anyone. You don't have cancer, Dad! That was just a lie you made up on the spot because Mom figured it out! Now who's acting paranoid? She knew, and I took your side, daddy's little girl, well not anymore, Dad. Gypsy needs to get out of this house right now! Well there's nothing going on there, Lexi, and if you insist on continuing this crazy protest, I'm gonna need you to get out of this house. Are you serious, Dad? I'm just protecting the girls. I mean I can't have you acting this way in front of them. They've been through too much already. So, it comes down to her or me?! My house, I'm in charge. I'll go pack my things then. Girl: Daddy. Leave now, Lexi, or I'll call the police and have you arrested for trespassing. I didn't know where else to go. You never have to go back there if you don't want to. But I have to, my sisters are there, with Gypsy, who we know nothing about. What? I had a friend run a credit check on her, and it's not good. She's running from some pretty hefty debts. It's a match made in hell, your father and her. We have to tell the police. You know I've tried that. Your father is a very charming man and beloved in this community. No one wants to believe that he is capable of hurting his family, especially now that he's lost his wife. I just, I have to find a way to get back into that house. I have to protect my sisters. Hi Dad, it's me. I'm sorry, I, I don't know what happened, but we're all grieving. Can we talk? Call me back. Please answer me. At least let me talk to the girls. Is, is Jaimie still having her nightmares? Are you taking them to ballet, because I think it's important that they have an outlet. Dad, please. You can't shut me out forever, Dad. I'm never gonna stop calling. Let's just talk this out or something. You can come home on one condition, y ou accept Gypsy. I know I lied about knowing her and about the cancer. I lied to protect your mother. I lied because I loved her. Okay, Dad, okay. Welcome home! How are the girls? They're fine. They've got a wonderful nanny now to take care of them. That's good to hear. Welcome back. This is my room. Your dad thought I'd be more comfortable in here. That's fine, I can, I can sleep with the girls. It's probably for the best, what with Jamie and her nightmares. So, I guess you'll be taking them to school and ballet now that you're back. I thought that was a part of your job. I'm a full time nursing student. Didn't your dad tell you that? I don't have a lot of time to drive children, but I'll help around the house when I can. I'm a medical student. But you never seem to be in medical school, do you? You're always here, controlling everything. Why can't you let it go, Lexi? My name is Alexis. Of course, Alexis. Your father is grieving right now. So if you're gonna be staying, you need to support him. I do what's best for my family. What's going on, Dad? I didn't know it was gonna feel like this. What? Losing your Mother. I'm sorry, I'm the parent, I want to be strong for you. Being vulnerable is being strong, Dad. Mom taught me that. Oh, I miss her so much. I know I've been acting out. I just, I didn't... I guess I don't know how to handle this grief. I miss her, too. There is stuff everywhere. Her clothes are in the closet. Her perfume's in the bathroom. Her CD player, her music, it all just reminds me of her. Of course it does. I think that's why I haven't been myself, you know, it's too hard. Her presence is, is just still in the room. Please help me, Lexi, will you help me pack it up? Yeah, of course. Okay, okay, I'm gonna go sleep on the couch. It's probably gonna take you some time. You want me to do it right now? I don't think we can live another day like this, do you? Yeah, go to sleep. I'll do it. I love you, Lexi. You've always been my girl. Good morning, Lexi. Did you sleep? Like a baby. And you're right. About what? Your mother's memory, it's all around this house. So, I was thinking we should get away, take a break, maybe we could take the kids to Disneyland. Oh, wow. You don't think that's a good idea? No, I, ah... What? Well, is she gonna come? Will you come if she doesn't join us? Yeah. Then I'll leave Gypsy at home. And I'll also need you to take Olivia to Ukraine, before you join us in California. You want me to fly her to Ukraine? She wants to visit her biological sister. That's a good idea, don't you think? Yeah, I, I guess she's been talking about her a lot. Great, I'll book the flights, you can take her, just, um, make sure to bring her passport with you when you join us. Won't she need her passport? Olivia, not when she's there. Besides, she'll just lose it, right? She just loses everything. We'll send it back to her before she flies home. It'll be great. Oh, girls, okay, girls, come to bed, come to bed, it's bedtime, it's bedtime. No, no, no, no. Come on, come on, Jamie. You're on the couch, you're on the couch. Jamie's on the bottom bunk and you are on the top. Stay, stay. Oh, Dad, here is Olivia's passport. Oh, thanks, forgot all about that. Okay, girls, go to bed. You need all of your energy for Disneyland, yes. Yea Disneyland! Lexi, I think you're gonna have to crash with me. The girls have taken the bunk beds. Yeah. Uhh! What is wrong with you, Dad? I keep thinking she's next to me, I'm sorry. No, stop, I don't believe that. You can't lie your way out of this one. Do you think that I'm capable of hurting you? I don't know what you're capable of anymore. What if it had been one of the girls? If you think that I would hurt one of them, then you're crazier than your mother. Don't you dare talk about Mom that way. Oh, Lexi, I'm sorry. No, no! Lexi, where are you going? It's the middle of the night. I'm gonna get some air. Stop this madness. You and I are a team. Daddy and his little girl. Who are you without me? I don't know, but I'm, I'm gonna go figure that out! Come on, guys, quick like bunnies, come on. Get in the car. We're going to Disneyland. Watch it, watch your toes, watch your fingers. You're coming? Yeah, of course I'm coming. Well, there's no room for you. Oh stop, Dad, I see what you're doing and it's not gonna work. You don't understand. I thought you were Michele, I was dreaming about her, so I thought I was touching her. You were touching me, Dad, me! Keep your voice down, they can hear you. No, I'm not going to! Maybe they should know what might happened to them! I didn't know it was you! Spare me the excuses, Dad. Look, I'm a very, very sexual person. Stop! This is so inappropriate. I'm still a young man. I, I could get married again. I, I want to have a lot more children. Dad, you already have enough kids! Why can't you focus on taking care of us?! Haven't I already done that? Do you want for anything? Look at you, I taught you everything I know, and now the world is yours because of me. Can we just go now, please? Not until you tell me that you understand. Understand what, Dad, that you have desires? Fine, but you'll still have Gypsy, isn't she enough?! So, what? Was my physical life supposed to die with your Mother? I told you not to talk about her like that! You don't realize how hard it was without Michele. Gypsy's been a rock. Without her, I don't know what I might have done. You are tearing the family apart, Dad, all because of this nanny with benefits. I don't understand! No, you're tearing this family apart, and now you'll never see them again. Those are my sisters in there, Dad, you can't keep me from them! Watch me. Dad! I'm in the middle of nowhere! Dad!!! Hello. Linda, he's gone crazy! He just took off with the girls! Linda: Where are you? Do you need me to come and get you? He was never like this, but now he's a monster. We just, we have to stop him. Lexi, I have tried. Do you still think he killed Mom? Yes. I don't know what to believe, but I, but I know I need to save my sisters. Well, we need to prove that he's committed a crime. He has committed a crime. I'm gonna report him for sexual assault. All I need is my sisters to be removed from my father's care. I'm afraid he might also attack one of them. I understand, I really do, but it's very difficult to remove children from a parent's home unless there's proof that your father has physically or sexually assaulted them as well. Well, I don't think he's assaulted them, but he assaulted me. Have you reported these attacks to the police? They said if I make a report of sexual assault that they'd have to investigate it, which means they'd have to contact my father, and if they contact him, he'll know it's me accusing him, and I'm afraid that he might retaliate against me, or one of my sisters. I'm sorry, I really am, but this sounds like a matter for the police. Without a report of your father attacking one of the minors, there's very little that Child Protective Services can do. But he's dangerous, and I can't just wait until he hurts another person that I love, I can't. There must be something we can do. I'm sorry, I really am. All we want is for these girls to be safe. Please, help these girls. The system is designed to keep kids with their parents. I want to help you, but without proof that they're in danger, my hands are tied. It isn't enough that he assaulted me. I think you need a lawyer. I've spoken to lawyers, none of them think that we stand a chance. Martin is just too well connected and respected. And he's too smart, he knows all of this. He knows how hard it is to charge someone for sexual assault. He always wins. He raised you as his protégé. You need to start thinking like him. Matin: Lexi, I don't have the strength to pull our family out of this emotional abyss, so I've decided that your sisters deserve a fresh start with the Millers. Martin: Look, you know we can't change the past and our lives as we knew them are over. Besides, the Millers are offering to raise the girls as their own. Trust me, Lexi, this is the only way forward. Mrs. Miller! Mrs. Miller, it's Alexis MacNeill! Please open the door. Please let me in. Lexi, what a surprise. Where are they? Oh, they're not here. The Millers took them to the park, and then they're gonna take them to dinner when they're done. You can't do this, Dad. Do what? They've adopted before. They know and love the girls. We lost touch with them years ago. You barely know your Aunt Linda, and that didn't stop you from becoming chummy. You're not asking the Millers to get chummy with the girls, you're asking them to raise them, which I can do, which I would love to do. You don't have time to raise three kids. You're gonna be a doctor. Let me talk to them. They can make the final decision. They've never been happier. I don't believe you, Dad, and where is Olivia? Because I keep trying to call her, and the number isn't working! Maybe she doesn't want to speak with you? Have you spoken to her? Of course, she wants to stay in Ukraine with her sister. I want to hear that from her. And has she spoken to any of her sisters? They must miss her. Please, let me just see them. You love to play being the saviour, little Miss Perfect. You taught me to be that way, Dad, and I'm not playing at anything. This might be a game to you, but this isn't a game to me. I'm talking to lawyers, and I'm fighting for custody, and I'm going to win! Go ahead, yeah, waste all your money on lawyers. It's not about money, Dad. I'm not like you! You're just like me, you're daddy's little girl. Maybe so, but you know what I learned from you, Dad? How to fight! I'll destroy you. I'll get you expelled from medical school. There's no reason for me to be expelled because I don't steal people's identities, and I don't sexually assault them! You're so naive, I could create any reason. I could be very persuasive. Did you kill Mom? Tell me, all those medicines that you prescribed. Did you do it? Did you kill her? Go home. Did you even give her CPR, Dad? Did you kill Mom?! Go now! You have no power over me anymore! I see you, Dad. Hello, I'd like to report a trespasser. I'll go now. Wait, hold on. I was wrong, it was just a skunk. Yes. Alexis MacNeill? Speaking. I'm calling from the Pleasant Grove Police Department. We received the toxicology report and the coroner's report. Can I give you a number to fax it to? So, anything? Come on, there's got to be something. Well, it says here that she died of natural causes. They think her heart failed. But if you look here, there's way too many drugs in her system. Wasn't she taking those for her recovery? Yeah, but she was down to two pills a day when I left. There's no reason she would be back on this many pills. And it also says here that she had lividity on the back of her legs, which means she died on her back. Dad said she was hunched over the side when he found her. He also said that he was giving her CPR when he found her, but there's tons of water in her stomach and lungs. If that were true, the amount of water wouldn't be close to this. That makes it clear that she was drowned. He killed her. And now we have proof. We need someone to take a look at this. A detective, an officer, anybody. Weren't you here last week? Yes, and I'm gonna be here the next week and the week after. I don't care how many times I have to drive from Nevada to Utah. I'll do my best. Your best? My Mother was murdered by my Father, a man who was having an affair when she died, a man who has a history of crimes to his name. Why won't the District Attorney take us seriously? Why won't the police re-open the case?! I'm sorry, I have to take this call. Pleasant Grove Police Department, how can I help you? Something will change. Someone will listen eventually. Who's left? We have tried everyone. I don't know, sweetie, but we need to keep the faith. Have you spoken to the girls? Yeah, I'm gonna see them this week. Luckily, the Millers don't see me as a trespasser. Alexis, I had no idea what your father was like when I agreed to take the girls. I thought he was grieving, and I wanted to help. I was thinking that the girls come live with me. I think that might be best. I agree. But you need to be aware of something else. Your dad is threatening to send the girls back to Ukraine, just like Olivia. What? They said Olivia never wanted to go see her sister at all, that the whole trip was your father's idea. And I helped him send her off. I hope that lawyer was right. Me too. You're gonna stay here? Call for help if I don't come back in 15? Yeah. Okay. Alexi. So you're still here. Why wouldn't I be? Well, it's just funny, a nanny living in a house with no kids. Turns out your father is just a big baby who needs taking care of. Let yourself in, why don't you? I thought that was you I heard down there. Sign it. What is it? It's a notice of temporary custody. The girls are coming to live with me. Is that so? I'm not asking your permission, I'm telling you to sign it. You didn't give the Millers consent. You threatened to send the girls back to Ukraine. If you don't sign it, I will call Child Protective Services. Are the girls outside? You think I would bring them anywhere near you, near her? But I want to see them. Maybe I could give them a blessing or. I can't legally bar you from seeing your children, but I will do everything I can to stop it. Plus, I don't think it's appropriate with Gypsy still living here. Why is that? I'm not gonna dignify that with an answer, not in the room you shared with Mom. Well, there's no romantic involvement here. She's just simply getting free room and board in exchange for cleaning and giving me my medication. Your medication, for what? Your fictional cancer? Stop lying, Dad. Sign the paper. Fine. You win this round. But we're not done. Jamie, Jamie, my love. Shh, it's okay, it's okay, my love, it's just a nightmare. I'm gonna make you some hot milk, okay, and you can pick a story, okay? Let me in, let me in! Are you crazy?! You think I don't know what you've been up to, but I know everybody in Pleasant Grove. You've been visiting the police, and the State's Attorney's Office, and the media, telling them that I killed your mother. I'm gonna call the police, Dad. I'm calling the police. If you think that I'm capable of murdering her, then you better stop and consider what else I might be capable of. Girls, girls, come here. It's okay, it's okay. We're gonna go to a hotel, okay, every night, a different one every night until we're safe. Test, test, okay. The buccal nerve is part of the mandibular. Ah, are you kidding me? Hmm-hmm. Lexi. Hi Dad, I'm sorry, I didn't get to the phone in time. Are you okay? Yeah, yeah, I'm just relieved. Sorry that I came here a poor man, and I just really miss my family so much. Well, you really scared the girls. I know, I'm, I'm sorry. You, you don't really think that I killed your mom, do ya? No, I don't, that was just me grieving, like you were. Grief makes your mind play tricks on you. Yeah, exactly. Like that night in the motel when you touched me, that was grief, right? Yes, exactly. It just took me a while to realize that because it, it was so shocking when you put your hands all over me. I, I know what I did. I... I just want to know if you forgive me now. Linda? What are you doing here? Is everything okay? Just tell me. Lexi. Did you find Olivia? No, I wish I had news about Olivia. Then what is it? I'm so sorry, they're not gonna move forward with the sexual assault charge. But we gave them proof of Martin confessing. These sexual assault charges are so tough to prosecute, and they're even harder when the accused is wealthy and well represented. I just thought we had him. If it's any consolation, the charges were dropped without prejudice, which means that they can still be brought to court later. Yeah, but that doesn't help me now. What do we do? We focus on getting parental rights over the girls. No more temporary custody. Your dad has been credibly accused of assault now, he won't fight you. Okay, and then what? And then, we keep fighting to put him away. Figured I'd find you here. Is this your new office? I'm retired, I don't need an office, just good coffee. Well, I got a case for ya. Has the definition of retirement changed? I only come in to help on cases I covered. I see. This isn't exactly a high priority. Look, a woman died of natural causes, but her family just won't stop hounding us. Like I'm sure it's nothing, but take a look, see if something's there. Here, Jaimie, go fast, go fast! You're doing such a great job with them, Lexi. I better be, I'm their official guardian now. Do you know what they asked me the other day? If I was their mother, or their sister. Oh, what did you say? I said I was their sister, but I'll be raising them. I just don't want them to forget that Mom is their mom, that can never change. Michele's looking down at you with pride, Lexi, I know it. Thanks. I just wish I wasn't always looking over my shoulder, wondering when he's gonna strike. Lexi, it's Olivia! She wants to come home. She just got her messages now. Olivia? Olivia: Alexis? Olivia, it's Lexi, we're gonna come get you, okay? You don't have to worry. Olivia: Thank you. Oh. Oh, my gosh. What do you two want? Olivia's passport. Olivia is happy in the Ukraine. No, she's not. You abandoned her there. I don't know why you would do that, but I am done trying to figure you out. Just give us the passport, Martin. I don't know where it is. Well, I'm sure it's in the safe where you keep all the passports. This is private property. If you prefer, we can call the adoption agency. I'm sure they'd be very happy to hear about your treatment of Olivia. Fine, I'll go get it. Are you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, I just need the passport. It's my fault he even has it. Stay out of trouble, Lexi. Hi, are you Kyle? Thanks for coming to Utah. I'm a little old-fashioned when it comes to meeting in person. Please, sit down. So, did you find something useful? Look, I'm a retired investigator for the DA's office. I don't have all the resources of the police department. But from what I have already found, this is mind blowing stuff. Here, your father's college transcript, or at least the one he said was his. He lied his way into medical school? It's shocking. And we may be able to get his medical license revoked, but to put him in jail, we need to find something concrete. Murder isn't concrete enough? The murder charge will take time, especially since the coroner ruled your mother's death accidental due to natural causes. But don't lose hope. In the meantime, we need to find something we can charge him with that sticks. Well, I might have something. I'm applying for custody of Olivia and I just got this updated copy of her birth certificate. It seems that Martin appeared in court with Olivia and had her name changed, except he did this while she was in Ukraine. Why? Well, he had her name changed to Jillian Martin. Gypsy, that's why he wanted her passport. Stealing a child's identity is one way to wipe out your mistresses debts. They really were made for each other. Identity fraud, this is concrete. This is something we can have him arrested for. You did this to your own father. I learned from the best. I've been charged before. You'll see, I'll be out soon. Maybe so, but it still gives us time to build our murder case. Oh, oh, listen to yourself, trying to destroy your father's life. I trusted you. I loved you, Dad. I wanted to be just like you. Exactly, and who are you now? Well, I'm on my way to becoming a doctor, a real one, you know, someone who doesn't fake their medical degree. I just have one question. Did you ever love me? You know what, don't answer that. It doesn't matter because what I am now is someone who loves myself enough not to care. Be honest, aren't you proud of me? Who else but your little girl could take you down? Lexi! You have to be believe that I loved you, Lexi! You have to believe that!! Alexis! Cal! It is so good to see you. In background: ♪ You said baby you don't know me, and I surely don't know you ♪ I'm so sorry that I'm late. Really, it is no problem at all. I mean, where else would I be? So, what was so important that you needed to see me in person? Well, I thought you'd want to know that the new coroner reviewed the original autopsy, and has revised your mother's cause of death from accidental to uncertain. What does this mean? It means that they will be charging your father with the first degree murder of your mom today. Do you swear to tell the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth? I do. It's your belief that your father gave her those drugs. Yes, it is. I've gotten to know my father very well in the last few years. I know what he's capable of. I think he found a way to get those pills into her system probably through her breakfast. We know he made her breakfast that morning. The pills would take some time to take effect, so that allowed him to go to work and make a few phone calls at the clinic, just enough time to build his alibi. Once he had his alibi, he went home and he left her in the tub, figuring that the pills would finish the job. And then he went to pick up my little sister, Jamie, from school. She was six years old. He wanted his six-year-old daughter to find her mom unconscious. And then he, he sent her to the neighbors, but there was just one problem, my Mother was not dead yet. She wanted to live. The coroner's report stated that the blood had settled in her back, so she couldn't have been slumped over the side of the tub like he said to police. He killed her. He hadn't called 911 until he drowned her. He knew by then that would have been too late. He knew exactly what he was doing. Is there anything you want to add that we couldn't know? What about his motive? Why, why would he destroy a life he built so carefully? I don't think we're ever gonna truly understand the mind of a sociopath. But I believe that my Mother was finally seeing through the depths of his lies. And if there was one person who had the power to destroy the image he built for himself, it was her. So, he killed her before she could damage him. I only wish that I had listened to her sooner. My Father took my Mother from us, but he hasn't shaken our faith in God, or in family, or in justice. Nancy Grace here, we are in a verdict watch, as a Provo jury mulls the fate of Martin MacNeill, a man who pretended to be not only a doctor, but a lawyer as well. A man who kills his wife, then moves his mistress into the family home, posing as a nanny, really? So, is this real? Six years after Michele MacNeill's death, the question remains: will there ever be justice for this beloved and beautiful mother? In the State of Utah versus Martin Joseph MacNeill, we, the jury, find the defendant, as to count one murder, guilty. Oh! Mr. MacNeill. It's Doctor MacNeill. Can you believe it's been 10 years since you've been gone? It still feels like yesterday, every day. But I do have some news. Dad took his own life in prison. I'm still struggling with the truth about the man who was my father, and it doesn't surprise me that he found a way to escape his sentence, but he's with his maker now, and there's no escaping that. I love you mom. I'll see you soon.
