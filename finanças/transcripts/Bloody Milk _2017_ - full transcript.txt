Come on, come on. Off you go! Easy. Don't worry. Hey, you. What are you doing? Get out. Cactus... You've already eaten. Whoa, whoa. No. OK, Cactus, come on. BLOODY MILK OK, be a good girl. There you go. - So, is she with calf? - Yeah. - You can put a plus sign. - I knew it. - Is it a girl? - I can't see yet. It's "female", Pierre. "Girl" sounds weird. She's my third best cow. It has to be a girl. OK, we're done. And... tell me, would you mind taking a quick look at Topaze? - What's wrong with her? - I don't know. You're gonna tell me. Well? So? She's perfectly fine. She's standing and ruminating, she's not in pain. - She's just gonna calve soon. - I know. Could it be the Belgian disease? - Belgian disease? - FHD. It's always on TV. The back hemorrhaging and all that. - For God's sake, Pierre... No. - What? - Are you kidding me? - What would I know? You're the vet. Go back to bed. You're not thinking straight. What are the symptoms? It's a hemorrhagic fever. Fever and bleeding. She doesn't have either. She's a healthy cow. OK? Feeling better now? What was that about? It's the baker. Mom's playing Cupid. I don't know what she told her, but now she honks at me. A fat level of 36 is just not good. Yeah, but she just had Escherichia coli. - I was expecting worse. - Are you happy? You'll never be first like this. I don't know if you read it right. I am first. In quality, yes, but you're sixth in production. I know. It's Verdure. She fucked up. Her cell count's 800,000. It's OK, it happens. Martinot must be devastated. He said you wouldn't make it alone at the farm... He laughed at you. He's not laughing now that you're first. Martinot has Alzheimer's. He can't tell between a dog and a watermelon. So, the ranking... Oh, please. He's putting up a show, that's all. Dad, did you see Fabrice is 42nd? What's the point of having a robot? I wonder that too. Angélique brought you this. The baker's bringing the bread now? That's crazy. Hi, Raymond. - What, you need some hay? - Yes, I need some hay. They're eating like crazy. - Alright. - And I think Miranda's limping. You should come. Just let me finish this first, OK? Yes. Stand over there, please. Raymond! I gotta finish my scraping. I'll be right with you. Yes. I'll be waiting. Things were different at the farm I used to go to. The cattle was different. - Oh? - Yes. It matched the nature of the owners. For sure. So, you said she was limping? I thought so, but... I may not be seeing very well. - Let's walk her around. - Yes. Come on, Miranda. Come on. - She's not limping. - Well... Listen... She's fine. Come on, Griotte. Hi, man, it's JD. I've called you a dozen times. Are you coming hunting or not? It'll take your mind off your cows. A bit of sunlight wouldn't hurt you. Hi, answering machine, what's up? If you ever see Pierre Chavanges, could you tell him to put down his Wednesday lunch box and come for a poker game with us? Oh, shit... Come on, push. Come on. Push, Top. That's it. Come on! I need you to help me. Come on, now. Come on. There you go! That's good. Come on. Easy now. Come on. That's good. There you go. Breathe. Breathe. Breathe. That's right. Yes. Alright, back to your places. How are you? Looking good. A bit more. Shush... Hey, you. How are you doing? Here, look. That's it. Come here, look. Right here. Look. There you go. Yes, that's good. No. Easy, easy. It's gonna be OK. There you go. It's OK. It's alright, it's OK. We're done. It's the B series. What could we name you? Biniou. "Biniou" is nice. OK, now. I'm sorry. You were great. What's going on with you? What's the matter, Topaze? You're not feeling well? Come on, get up. Get up now, come on. Come on. Get up. Get up, Topaze. Topaze, get up. Come on! Get up! What are you coming down with? What's the matter? Fifteen messages... Fifteen! You do realize it's not normal. You weren't answering. - Why is Régis here? - So he can see. See what? The cow? You too. I need two witnesses for the injection. - She calved last night? - Yes. - What's her temperature? - 42. Must be Escherichia coli. - Hi, Régis. - Hi, Pierre. Why is he the one examining her? Today's my day off, Pierre. - You take days off? - Don't start. 41.7 degrees C. It's mastitis - the E. Coli type. You can write in your notebook of paranoia: "Vets say not Belgian disease". I'll prep you an IV of Vetcardiol. - Marbocyl for the mastitis. - Great. What if she does have the disease? There have only been three cases, all of them in Charente! How would it get here? Thanks to vets who only see mastitis. You piss me off. - I'm following the protocol. - What? You think it's FHD? I'm calling the Prevention Center. - What is she doing? - No idea. At worst, they'll send an expert. They're gonna slaughter my herd! Wanna get all my cows killed? Yeah, that's right. He'll be here tomorrow. You must cancel. It's not worth it. You've no choice. The call's been made. Hello, my name is Jamy. I am a farmer in Belgium. I lost all my cows, all my livestock, because of the FHD. I'll tell you how it happened. At first, one was not well. I said, "That one's coming down with something". And then that cow went down. I got her up. I milked her to see if there was anything in the milk. Nothing. Two days later, she had a fever. I called the vet. When the vet came, he noticed the little stains. It was very fast. The next day, they came and slaughtered the whole herd. They disinfected everything, and that was it. It all happened really fast. In one day, I lost everything. Well? How are you? Are you OK? Yes, you are. This is Pascale Chavanges... I'm gonna show you how to make a silencer. You're gonna need an old tube from a BB gun. You cut it up. You have to make sure it fits your barrel. This isn't working, so... I'm sorry. Oh, fuck... Shit. Come on. - Hello. - Hello. So, how's your cow? She's doing a lot better. This is a perfectly healthy cow. Did you examine it? She was weak yesterday. She started getting better. What did you give it? Vetcardiol and calcium. Dr. Chavanges, are you aware of how much work we have? Call only when in real doubt. This animal is clearly fine. - I asked her to. - Typical farmers' paranoia. Please, hold your brother. I was ready for slaughter. It's better this way. What did you do? Where's that cow? Where's the cow, Pierre? - I was right. - What? - Are you kidding me? - She was pissing blood. Let me see her. - No. - Let me see her, now. Take me to her! - Are you fucking kidding me? - I watched her burn! You're insane. You expected me to let them all die? - You don't understand. - Be quiet. Shut up. What're you doing? Pascale! You're not gonna say anything. I'm not, you are. You have until tonight. We were wondering... Who was the vet we saw this morning? What? Oh, just a trainee. With all those wrinkles? I don't think so. Were you spying on him or something? He's an old trainee, that's all. Oh, really? There're old trainees now? So, here are the certificates they sent me. What for? To certify that I'm eligible for compensation. I got several of these. Certificates and more certificates... And these are my bank statements. What does it say here? It says I haven't been paid a single franc. Not one euro, nothing. They shot my cattle a month ago, no compensation. Should I kill myself too? They want me to... I know about this, delays and all. - Careful. - Oh, stop it... What are these websites, Pierre? This one actually thinks... that the Illuminati are against him. You said she was fine. - I didn't make them sick. - They're not sick. Only one of them was sick, and that's settled. Pierre, you killed and burned a cow. We could go to jail! - Can't you see? - I saved the other 25. - You did not. - I did. You don't know! They've no idea how this disease is transmitted. They want to kill them all. - Is that normal? - Of course. It's the precautionary principle. You've no choice. And if I say it, what happens? I can't do anything else. I've never done anything else. OK, fine. But you do this one more time and it's over. I will check on them, and you'll take their temperature every day. Every day, Pierre. - If there's another one... - No. - If there's another one... - No. You don't know. If there's another one, we call them, and it's over. Am I clear? Yes. Easy, girl, it's OK. OK, sweetie, come here. Here we go. Easy. Come on, girls, come on. - Hello, Pierre. - Hello, Angélique. Your mom asked me to bring the bread. - Is that OK? - Well... yes. But I'm taking just one. - Your mom said... - Actually, I wanted to talk to you. My mother has been... talking a lot lately. And... - Well... - You don't want to see me? No, no... It's not that. It's just I'm busy right now. - I see. I can help you. - That's why I... No, you can't help me. But I appreciate it. So...? So, Jean-Denis' diner. If you like. Tonight? Tomorrow? Sure, I'm super happy. OK, great. - I'm gonna go. - I gotta go back. Damn it. - Hello, Pierre. - Hello. - Alright? - OK. Milk recording's not today. Yes, it is. I called you, didn't I? - Where's your notebook? - I don't know where I put it. Too bad, the recording is indeed today, and it starts right now. There. Are you OK, Pierre? You're quiet today. Yeah, I'm fine. How many cows left to milk? Well... These are the last ones. No. I haven't seen No. 5001 yet. Yes, I forgot to tell you. She's gone. Gone? How can that be, Pierre? I took them to the pen, and the next morning, one was missing. If it's missing, you must go to the station and get a report. If you had a veterinary check, you'd be in trouble. I'll take it off my list for this month, but I can't do two non-checks in a row. We need a solution for next month. Of course, I'll do it. I thought about it, but I didn't have time. You better hurry. A vet check can happen at any time. You never know. A cow doesn't just go missing. It's obvious. It can't cross the border with a fake passport. - Have you looked for it? - We did, but... Who's "we"? What? Who's "we"? My sister and myself. Your sister's name? Pascale Chavanges. The vet? She's your sister? Yes, why? "Pascale Chavanges". Have you called the Forestry Office? If you haven't, we can't report it missing. - And that's a problem. - We looked for her. We looked for her in the woods and the neighboring fields. Nothing. How crazy. All these cows running away. Francine, how about a ride to the gypsy camp? Seems Jack's been stealing ATVs. There may be a connection. What do you say, Chavanges? - Maybe. - They make carriages with cows and ATVs. You see, I'm reading your statement, and I kinda feel like you're bullshitting us. What happened to the cow? I ate it. Now, that's more like it. Your cow's actually in your freezer. You farmers are so funny. Why don't you share it with us? You bring us 1.5 kg of sirloin steak plus some ribs, and we'll leave you alone. CHAROLAISE SPECIAL OFFER Hey... Come on. You'll eat when we get there. - That wasn't very smart, Pierre. - What? My name's on a report about a missing cow after a DDPP health inspection. - What if they investigate? - They don't care. Why was he a pain, then? He wanted some ribs. He won't investigate. - You don't know about that! - Yes, I do. - You put all your chips on a hunch? - Shall we bet on yours? Mom asked me who the old man in the yard was. - She did? - Yes. She controls me, but she leaves you alone. Of course she does. She doesn't care. Shit, that's her. - Hello? - Where are you? - Err... Nowhere. - Where are you? - I'm not far. - I'm in the yard. I can't see you. OK, what do you want? Your dad says a cow's missing in the pen. We went to check the fences - they're fine. Of course my fences are fine. Who do you think I am? There's no missing cow. Why won't you tell me where you are? What's with all the questions? Do I ever ask you where you are? I told you, I'm in your yard. They noticed the missing cow. Wow! There we go. Here, Mom. What did you want to tell us? OK... You're going on vacation. The two of you, in Corsica. You're leaving Saturday. Alright, cheers. But... why? You deserve it. Let me show you some pictures. It's really beautiful. Look. You don't like it? I do. I like it. A five-star, though. It's too expensive for us. Besides, it's calving season. We can't just leave you. What are you talking about? I can manage. You want to stay home in case something comes up? Mom, you haven't even looked at the pictures. We've things to do. Saturday's too soon! There's nothing to do. - Why not Saturday? - Forget it. She's looking for a pretext. They wouldn't leave this dump for anything. I like it. There are nature reserves. Can we dive in September? Yes, sure. - It's always the same photo. - You have to scroll down. - Mom? - I don't want to. You go with your father. How can you turn down a 2-week vacation? Nobody does that. What about your lunch? For fuck's sake... OK, picture this. Say Angélique is coming over. You think I want her to see you hanging around here with your Tupperware all day? How interesting is a 35-year-old living with his parents? You don't live with us. We bought you a house. Are you serious? I want you out of here. Go to Corsica, damn it. I want to be by myself, without you for two weeks, just once! Is that too much to ask? Come on, let's go. All they want is for us to die. Oh, no... We're out. Don't worry. She'll be fine when she gets there. Let's go to Corsica! You eat fast. It's good. So... Do you listen to music? - Yes. - Like what? Everything that plays on the radio. - Is everything OK? - Yes, thank you. - Do you need anything? - No, it's perfect. - Nice hair. - Thanks. - Is it itchy? - Huh? No, it's just the tag. Your collar's fine. I know. Like I said, it's the tag. I don't care about looks. I'm fine with it. Looks? What you look like. You being a farmer is fine with me. Don't worry about that. Why would it bother you? It doesn't. It doesn't bother me. No, stop. - No. I have to get up early. - And? Since when is work a handicap for getting drunk? - Cheers. - Cheers. Why the long face? It's good that you go out. Your folks are away. You think you could come hunting with us? My parents have never stopped me from it. Then they won't mind if you buy us a drink afterwards. The robot gives you information about your cows. What's the point? You'll be staring at your phone. Pierre will understand. Look. Activity chart. Daily production... Milk quality chart with cell count. - Are they happy? - What? Does the robot tell you if your cows are happy? If they're not sick? Sure. Come on! I don't know if it warns about FHD, though. There are no tests, let alone an app. This is Dutch. OK, give me that. We're not at work. - Stop it. - No. You don't care, you have a bar. I have debts and a family. You own 500 acres of land nonetheless. Go ahead and kill yourself. There're guns everywhere. Easy, girl. Calm down. Calm down. There you go. Good. Alright. Shit. Fuck... - JD? - Yeah. - How's it going? - I'm good. - Look, we're gonna have to cancel. - No, forget it. Please, I have a problem. - We're on our way. - Why don't you come tomorrow? Tomorrow... Hello? JD? Fuck... Come on, hurry up. Get up, get up. Get up, damn it. Come on, do it. Are you doing this on purpose? Come on! Hey, what happened to you? I've got a broken pipe... You wanted to cancel because of a pipe? What are you talking about? - Hunting wankers. - You're the hunter. Why don't you put your phone away for five minutes? - Don't you want to be with us? - I do, or I'd be at home. To hell with that. - There. Happy? - Yes, I'm happy. Your cows are quite loud, don't you think? One of them is going to bull. She's a bit excited. - Doesn't sound like it. - Yes. - It's screaming up there. - She's screaming down. - Down. - It's not coming from the pen. No, I don't think so. Last time I heard that, a fox entered the shed... - Do you want to go bowling? - What? Bowling? What for? To bowl. Are you stupid or what? I'm not bowling. Guys, I never go out. Let me do it for once. Come on. Really? And you want to go bowling. - Well, yeah. - Sure, let's go. We're not gonna go bowling? Why not? What's wrong with bowling? Everybody wants to bowl. Why are you being a pain? We want to go bowling. - Hello. - Hello. I'm with three friends. A tall guy... They're near the giant penguin. You're The Cow Prince. Excuse me? - What's your shoe size? - I'm a 41. Thank you. They got the unlimited package. You can play nonstop until closing time. I'm not staying all night. What are you doing? We're ready. Come on, move it. Move your ass. - Alright? - Good, how are you? Having a good time? Stop it! What? I didn't do anything. Want some? - No. - It's crap, but it's blue. It's called Blue Moon. I've had four. Nice. Good for you. And I'm not over yet. - Don't you wanna taste? - It's Blue Moon. - Try it. - No. - Come on! - No! THE COW PRINCE Last one and I'm off. What? We're having a rematch. Fabrice won 5 games. No rematch. Come on, just one rematch! - I'm going. - Going where? - Home. - We're coming with you for a drink. - No. - We can go to my place if you want. Guys, you do what you want, I'll throw this ball and go home. Hey, what's the matter? We've been here three hours. I gotta work tomorrow. I want to go home, OK? Have a drink. It might do you good, no? No, it won't. It's 2 in the morning. Seriously, you think we're idiots? Do we look like idiots? What have we done to you? Quit pretending! I have to go home, alright? To do what? Take care of your cows? At this time? Is that all you have in life? Fuck, man, you'll never change. You know what? Go home. Go home, beat it. Can you drive me home, please? Can you drive me? Why don't they drive you? Well... they're in no hurry to leave. The robot works 24/7. - Do you want to see? - No, thanks. OK, well... Goodnight. Oh, shit. There you go... Come on. Come on, let's go. Get moving! Come on! It's OK, nothing's gonna happen. Stop it. Get in. Come on! Fuck! You piss me off! It stinks in there. Hi, Raymond. So, you've run out of hay? No, I've got some left. It's Miranda. She's not doing well. What's wrong with her? I don't know. Is she down? - She's up and then down... - Come on, let's take a look. Wait for me. If you don't give them water, they'll die. It was full of hay. - You freaked me out. - I'm sorry. I bothered you for nothing. It's no big deal. Alright, see you later. The cow in the manure pit, wasn't it in the milking shed? What? The cow in the manure pit, wasn't it in the milking shed? What's that about? She was screaming like crazy the other night. - And you weren't there. - You were nosing around? No. No. - There's nothing in the pit. - There is. Something stinks and we don't know what it is. Something stinks and we don't know what it is. Really? Is there a cow in the pit? - No. - What's in the pit? Something stinks and we don't know what it is. Yeah. Right. Call me if you need any more hay. So, did you get home safely? As you can see. What's all that lime for? My fields. You're late for spreading. You're not my mother. - I didn't want to piss you off. - Well, you did. - Hi, Pierre. - Hey, Fab. - OK? - Not really. I'm missing a cow. She didn't text you? You're gonna be quiet. Easy... Come here. I need you to be quiet. Shush... Shush... Come here. Come here. Shush. Easy. Come on, let's go. There you go. Easy, easy. Hey... The hemorrhagic fever disease continues to spread. After Belgium and the Netherlands, new cases have appeared in France, particularly in Charente. A fast evolution that scares Brussels and Europe. The EU bodies have therefore decided to strike hard. In order to stop the spread of this disease that would only affect cattle, the European Parliament has decided to slaughter all herds in the event of mere suspicion. A radical precautionary decision that is necessary according to the health authorities. The first total slaughter of herds is expected within the next few weeks. OK, she's with calf. Have we seen them all? Well... Except for No. 4506, because... She's gone. What do you mean? She's just gone. Why didn't you tell me before? It's serious! I absolutely have to report this. I went to the cops, I reported her. It seems the gypsies are stealing ATVs and cows. What did you do, Fabrice? Nothing. I don't know. Not all of them get used to the robot. Maybe she got scared and ran away. When did you last see her? I've no idea. But on the computer it says "Tuesday night". And then, nothing? No. - Everything alright? - Yes, why? You've nothing to tell me? I don't think so. I was at Fabrice's. He's missing a cow. And...? What's it to me? Do you have something to say? I'm busy here. That's all? Yeah, that's all. What are you doing? I'm saving us from jail. It's over, Pierre. What's the plan? Get rid of all thirty as they die? Hush the two others and get your compensation. That's never been the problem. Keep taking your samples. Come on. Come on. Get in. Today, we'll be discussing the latest solution offered, which is chemical. I don't know if you can see. This is Ciprozole 10 mg. And Suprexil. I was advised to take these. Basically, you still die, only you're less aware of it. It's cooler. They also advise you to take sleeping pills. You get some sleep before taking the medicine, it's easier that way. So thank you for the awesome tips. Would you come and see? My cows aren't doing very well. Hello. Am I disturbing you? You better not be a salesman. No, I'm a farmer. Pierre Chavanges. And you're Jamy. Yes. - Why are you here? - I'd like to talk. Your compensation, did you get it? No, not yet. It happened so fast. One of them was not well for a few days, and when the fever started, I called the vet. When the vet came, he noticed the stains on the cow. And then the next day, it was over. They showed up in suits, like in E.T. Those spacesuits... They sanitized everything. And that was it. Have you seen that movie, E.T.? You've never seen it? Yes, sure. I think it's a beautiful movie. I have to show you something. Here are their passports and the reproduction records. - This one makes 17,000. - You want me to keep them? Yes. Until you get your own cows. They'll be fine here. I killed the sick ones before the vet comes. - Are these OK? - I'm first in the dairy rankings. - They're not sick? - No. You know what my nickname is? So those are 30 healthy cows? 26. OK... Right. You're gonna sit there. We're making a little video. - A video for what? - My YouTube channel. This, my friend, is a bomb. We're gonna tell them we have 30 sick cows, and if they don't change the law on free trade, the cows will be released into the wild. My cows are not sick, Jamy. I leave them here, we wait for a vaccine to come out... A vaccine? There will be no vaccine! You need to wake up. They want to take us down, that's all. An epidemic would suit them. I don't want anyone to know where my cows are. - No one will find out. - They will. No. We have a chance to get one million views. Then, we'll be on the news. We need people to talk about us! No. They'll find us. I didn't come all the way here to see my cows die. Your cows aren't gonna die. And even if they do die, they won't die for nothing. If we don't talk, it'll be us who die in vain! People have to talk about us. It's important! - No? - No. Pierre, where are you? On my way home. How many sick ones? Just one. It's not fair. No, it's not. But you're not alone. Yes, I am. I'm here. I'll be there in the morning. Pierre, people are calling us. No one knows what is going on at the farm. So please, give us a call. OK, bye. Hi, Pierre, it's Fabrice. I'm sorry about all this. It's such a goddamn mess. I guess it'll be hard for you to start up the farm again, so if you ever put it up for sale, I'd be interested in buying. Call me back soon. Bye now. Hey, man... Answer the phone, will you? Or come over so we can talk. - What're you doing? - I'll milk them. No, they're already penned. The perimeter's set. I wanna milk them. Don't make things worse, sir. What's going on? Your brother wants to milk his cows now. Well... Just let him do it. We're not ready, anyway. And the cows will be calmer. Come on. 1401... Pierre? Pierre, I'm sorry. You need to bring us your calf. He's on the list. Put in 20 milliliters. Subtitles: ECLAIR
