My name is Bastard Nobody has such a name I don't know, my mom always call me this Bastard is an awful name Do you want me to give you a new name? No, my mom always call me this She will be upset if I change my name Do you have other family members? Only my mom I live in the mountains with my mom and never meet any other people Few months ago, I woke up and found mom was gone I came down the mountains to look for her I've got lost and don't know how to get back home Do you want to know who I am? No Well, this is Motian Cliff Motian Master is my nickname When people hear my name, they're so scared ...they can't eat or sleep Why'd they be scared? The names Motian Master and Bastard are similar They are not scary Don't you think I'm powerful? Very powerful. You aren't even like normal human being What? You're like the gods in heaven I'm sure you must have learned from a good teacher And you want me to teach you martial arts You can ask now. I'll teach you. Why would I want to learn martial arts? I won't ask you to teach me martial arts I wish to teach you even if you don't want to learn If you insist, I'll learn anyway Don't be angry How do you feel? Feels like I am in a fireplace Don't worry, I'll teach you how to stay cool Your body is full of yang energy Now you have to generate yin energy Follow the places I touch and generate the energy Stinky boy, I can't kill you because I have to keep my promise But I can teach you how to generate energies except how to harmonize them Conflicting energies in your body will kill you Then I have nothing to do with your death Kid, you'll die soon Mr. Bei, he looks like Chief Shi Let's go inside and take a look first His body is as hot as fire Rubbish, he's cold as ice He uses supreme methods to generate energies But he doesn't use them right. He's dying now What can we do now? Do you think my nickname "Doctor" is just a name? I can at least give him a few more days Let's bring him back Yes Brother Yu... Brother Yu So at last you wake up Somebody is coming, I'll come back to see you Chief, you're up! I... I am going to tell Mr. Bei Wait Mr. Bei, this guy looks like our chief But he practises the wrong way, and... I wonder if he could live until that devil Xie Yanke arrives Messages from the Yangtze River indicate that Xie arrived at the headquarters of Tieqiang Gang and wanted to kill 137 members Their Chief didn't want to interfere and protect his members So Xie had killed all 137 gang members If Xie came to Zhangle Gang three to five hundred names might be on his list and would be all killed Mr. Bei, you and I... Xie Yanke might be a devil But he has also promised that if the Chief is willing to redeem the whole gang All the gang members will survive Now we've found a fake Chief to redeem our crimes We should not be afraid, right? All three of us have to keep this secret Mr. Bei, Chief has woken up Chief... Thank goodness, Chief, you're awake You three are... Your subordinate Bei Haishi Your subordinate Zhu Hengye Your subordinate Qiu Shanfeng I don't deserve this... What do you call me? How come I am your Chief? Chief, your name is Shi Zhongyu You've been the Chief of Zhangle Gang for two years Is that so? I'm not Shi Zhongyu, my name is Bastard I've been in Motian Cliff the last two years Chief, you are feeling well now Please take some rest, we're leaving now Wait a second I'm confused. I'm sure I am in Motian Cliff How come I am... Sister, please come over You want me to come over so you can put your hands all over me? What do you mean? You are pretty Who are you? You don't recognise me? I'm Shijian, a maidservant A maidservant? What does that mean? Stop pretending I'm speaking the truth I am really not your Chief I want to tell them about this Please lie down Now you believe me Only I believe that you've forgotten everything How did I forget everything? Must be the energy practice that old man taught me Chief, subordinate Zhanfei wants to see you Chief Rapist, you deserve this Mr. Zhan, you... Rapist, you raped my wife, I'll kill you Your Kaibei Palm is very powerful How's the Chief? I haven't killed him, his energies bounce back What happened... I don't know what happened I am well now, my body is not cold or hot Rapist, you stole my wife, I... I stole your wife? Why would I steal your wife? You've just hit me with your palm, isn't it? You hit me with your palm and I'm feeling well No more cold and hot, & no more pain too Chief, congratulations Mr. Zhan's Kaibei Palm is very powerful He hit you at the Shanzhong acupoint on your chest It helped you harmonise the yin and yang energies Now you've attained supreme powers Supreme powers? Chief, Mr. Zhan has done good for the Gang Please don't blame him and let him go He has saved me, why'd I blame him? I have to thank him instead I am not your Chief You've taken the wrong person. Bye for now Both of you... Chief, please take some rest We'll talk tomorrow Get some sleep Hope I'll understand it all when I wake up tomorrow It's you I am dreaming again Come Come See, I've prepared food and wine I heard that you've totally recovered Members of Zhangle Gang are very happy about this Lady, who are you? Why are you treating me so well? You don't know who I am? I don't You've forgotten what you told me before? Me? I've never told you anything before Well done This is my grandpa Grandpa, how are you? Dingdang, your lover is an idiot I don't like him Grandpa, you... Kid, you... You do have sharp eyes Grandpa, please come over Take a seat You take a seat too Little kid, what's your name? My name is Bastard Do you know who I am? You are this young lady's grandpa Why do you address her as 'this lady'? It is this lady, sure she is What is this all about? Grandpa, he pratices too much and is confused You used to call me Dingding Dangdang. I'm Dingdang Dingding Dangdang? My grandpa is an evil killer Brother Yu, don't try to be funny Right, your grandpa is called Ding Busan I kill only three people every day Today, I haven't killed three yet You caught my hand when you first saw me and you wanted to kiss me I would not do such things I was anxious and bit you on the shoulder You were bleeding And you have a scar on your shoulder since then You didn't bite me, I don't have a scar on my shoulder Dang, what a bite. Let's go home Go home Of course, let's go home This kid is my grandson-in-law But I think he doesn't want to be My granddaughter had bitten him He cannot deny it Otherwise how can I face other people? Go Let's go Go Prostrate for Heaven and Earth Kneel down Offer prostration to the elders Come on Husband and wife bow to each other Dingding Dangdang, I'm not Shi Zhongyu I'm just Bastard, you're making a mistake If you don't believe, then don't blame me later Scoundrel, still want to get away! Kneel down now Bei of Zhangle Gang paying respects to Master Ding We're coming to take our Chief back You... Stop, they are fighting because of me I have to explain to them Okay, everyone stop Listen to me, you've all mistaken me for someone else Chief, stop joking, we've something important to do Xueshan School has sent over many top fighters Chief, please go back and handle this Dingding Dangdang, I don't want to leave you Too bad you've made a mistake You'll regret if I stayed with you It's better for me to go with Mr. Bei Bastard, do you really want to leave? Grandpa Chief, leave now "Zhangle Gang" Zhangle Gang is a famous gang How come its Chief doesn't come out and meet people Our four seniors have already gone to invite the Chief Please wait a moment I've heard that the Chief of Zhangle Gang is a twenty-year-old young man Well, one does always come across young heroes! His name is Shi Zhongyu? Yes, he is our Chief That's strange. Xueshan School has been looking for a traitor for two years This guy is also named Shi Zhongyu He should also be twenty this year The Chief is here Let's meet Chief Shi first Chief, please take a seat You're all from Xueshan School, right? I've met this young lady before You sure have a flair to recognize pretty young ladies Shi Zhongyu You make a mistake again, I'm not Shi Zhongyu Mr. Bai Brother Wen, this is my archenemy I can'tjust kill him in one sword stroke Xueshan School may be famous and powerful But Zhangle Gang is not weak too Gang members or swordsmen; One can'tjust ignore the ethics His parents send him to study with Xueshan School Parents? I only have a mom But I don't know who is my dad But he raped his sister and killed his brothers Brother Feng is his uncle and he dares to hurt him He doesn't deserve your support That Shi Zhongyu has done something bad But I am not Shi Zhongyu You have made a mistake Our school has unique sword fighting methods Each stroke has six variations It can leave marks like those on the wall Shi Zhongyu, before you committed your crimes You had upset me and I wanted to teach you a lesson I had made six sword strokes on your leg And left six scars If you are not Shi Zhongyu Then roll up your trousers and show us your leg I really am not Shi Zhongyu I don't mind to show you my leg Shi Zhongyu, how can you explain this? Chief, hit his Dazhui acupoint Where's the Dazhui acupoint? Now come along. Don't try anything smart, okay! Okay, I'll come along Let him go, don't hurt the Chief We now take this little devil back Before heading for Zhangle Gang We've asked Mr. Shi and his wife to meet us here Do we have to wait for them? The Shis are great swordsmen They have to act according to ethics so they cannot defend their son Brother Bai, thanks for the compliment My son Brother, no matter what happened Please let us talk to our son first No. And I've hit his vocal acupoint So he can't answer your questions Brother Bai, now we've arrived Our son cannot escape Brother Bai, please untie him and let him explain No way But it is a long way to Xueshan You can'tjust tie him up like this all the way Brother Bai, don't worry We'll be responsible for his escape Who knows what you'd be responsible for! Do you know where this little devil had been? He'd been the Chief of Zhangle Gang I think you must have heard of the reputation of Zhangle Gang This might be a complicated story Zhangle Gang has many powerful swordsmen Why choose him as their Chief? Brother Bai, please untie him first Want to fight again? I think it's better not to fight I've hit your mute acupoint, how come you can talk? This kind lady doesn't want me to be tied up So I'm getting up now They hurt people before finding out the truth They can't take our son away They are fighting anyway Son, let's go. They want to kill you They won't, I didn't do anything bad Why they want to kill me? Really want to kill me? Old sir, it's you How come you still... You do have some luck Old sir, I don't understand Why everyone calls me Shi Zhongyu and the Chief And I probably might be this Shi Zhongyu What do you say? I can't make everything clear right now You do want to tell me about it, right? If you beg me, I'll listen If you don't want to listen, then I won't tell you Your body's Yin & Yang energies are harmonised Now you have the most supreme power No one is more powerful than you, except me I have supreme power? Let's go "Zhentian" Old sir, what is this place? Headquarters of Zhentian Gang Zhentian Gang talks great But they indulge in dirty deeds Old sir, what do they do? According to my reward & punishment scheme Zhentian Gang has done numerous evil things Twenty-four people have to die Want me to kill them all, or the Chief dies for them So they can redeem their sins? Xie Yanke, you're such a bully So you want to oppose me with your gang? That's right These two are... Son, Xueshan School accuses you of... I'm sure he didn't do it I didn't do anything You see Son, one has to be responsible for what he has done Your reputation is the most important So you have to come with us and go to Xueshan. Let's go Xueshan, where's Xueshan? Son, you... So you two also make a mistake You don't even recognise your mom? Sure I can recognise my mom Brother, see what Xueshan School has done to our son I'm his mom, and he said... So you must think I'm Shi Zhongyu Right? Madam, when that incident happened back then... Son, mom wants to tell you something about the past Twenty years ago, you were just a year old Your younger brother was just born We named him Shi Zhongjian Mom has an enemy, who was an evil woman Her name was Mei Fanggu She was the princess of an evil cult from the west Be good This woman was unreasonable Not only that The next night that evil woman... Mei Fanggu, you've taken Zhongjian... Back to you That evil woman killed your baby brother Zhongyu, you are the only son we have It must be very hard for you these days No matter what, your parents will take care of you I am not sure what happened But I can remember my mom clearly I am your mom, call me mom now Are you sure I am your son? I am not, I really am not Zhongyu must have undergone great shocks So he can't remember anything Don't worry, we can treat him with medicine He will remember everything in the past Heaven has mercy on us Now the three of us are once again a family "Lai'an Inn" What are you thinking? Zhangle Gang is famous and powerful Why do they want Zhongyu to be their Chief? Zhongyu has supreme powers He deserves the position of Chief I don't think so Right, it must be the reward & punishment scheme Xie Yanke? Right, Zhangle Gang became powerful three years ago lts members have done many evil deeds Bei Haishi is a cunning guy He wants to use our son to save the whole Gang Now we know of Zhangle Gang's evil plan And Zhongyu has enough trouble He can't afford to have some more Escape to a faraway place? No, let's take our son to Zhangle Gang's headquarters ...and explain to them that our son cannot be their Chief Right Let's go That Shi Zhongyu is really fortunate He has such good parents and a wife like you... like Dingding Dangdang What are you saying? Are you not Shi Zhongyu? Together we made prostration to Heaven and Earth But we're not husband and wife yet Otherwise it is truly... What kind of games are you playing? He doesn't want you I should kill him at once Grandpa No bullshit If I want to kill a person, he can't escape from me Grandpa, you want me to marry him He doesn't even know who he is I want you to marry Shi Zhongyu not marry some Bastard Right, Dingding Dangdang, your Grandpa is right It's not right, Grandpa wants to kill you Grandpa, he doesn't even fight back It's shameful to kill him Nobody stops him to fight back He has supreme powers, he doesn't want to hurt you Stupid girl, what are you talking about? His inner power is better than you Why don't you fight back? I... I don't even know martial arts Zhongyu, I can teach you martial arts I'm sure you can win over Grandpa after a month Fine, now you have a husband And you want to teach him to fight your Grandpa It's because you want to kill him Okay, you can teach him for a month Then he'll die without any regret You really forget what you've learned before? I'd never learned martial arts Doesn't matter, you have supreme powers I'll teach you everything in a month So Grandpa won't be able to kill you Why is he after my life? Practice again Should be like this Where's that little devil? Zhongyu was with us We're bringing him to Zhangle Gang to resign Then take him to Xueshan to pay for what he did But he suddenly disappeared Only kids would believe in such bullshit I never tell any lies No matter what happened Zhongyu will go to Zhangle Gang Let's go to Zhangle Gang and wait for him Right, let's go there and wait; Wait for several days So that little devil can escape Brother Feng, if my son had committed a crime I won't forgive him Please trust me Okay, Mr. Shi has to bring in his son That's for sure Fine, let's go What kind of martial arts is it? This kid is dead Go away, it's not a month yet Okay... Practice. If you don't focus on your practice I'll kill you before Grandpa does I'm practicing... Again More than eighty members of Zhentian Gang including their Chief, were killed by Xie Yanke There are also Feiyu Gang and Jinlong Gang More than sixty people Xie Yanke is travelling down the river He will come to Zhangle Gang soon And Chief Shi is still missing I think... even Chief Shi is here, there's something wrong Two years ago, he had promised that if Xie came here ...he would fight for us That's why we have made him the Chief And let him do whatever delights him Now he's an idiot with a confused mind You have made a mistake The one from Motian Cliff is not Chief Shi Then who is this person? I knew he's not Chief Shi I made the scars on his body when he was unconscious My original plan was having him with us until Xie came Then we'd force him for redemption on our behalf But he has attainted supreme powers ...unexpectedly So what do we do now? Before Xie Yanke comes here... we have to find Shi Zhongyu first A month's time is up... at noon! Grandpa, can you give us a few more days? No, just a month, no delays Time is up Zhongyu, don't worry Grandpa is not your match Don'tjust defend, attack It's hot Zhongyu, you have won Grandpa doesn't want to kill me? He can't kill you You even snatched his weapon He can't kill you again Forget it This time Grandpa will stay in the mountains for at least ten years to figure out how to win over you This is Grandpa's blade It's very sharp, you can have it Dingding Dangdang, I've been here for a month Mr. Shi and his wife promise to take me to Zhangle Gang, and I... Right, will resign from being their Chief I want to travel around with you and have some fun When Xie Yanke comes in, let's attack him Don't let him speak even a word Give him a sudden attack Yes Chief has come back Chief, it's good to see you again We know that Xie Yanke is coming soon He doesn't wish to head the Zhangle Gang Yes, I was not Chief of Zhangle Gang Chief, we all treat you well Now you have to keep your promise You're all good to me, but... but I... People of Xueshan School, Mr. And Mrs. Shi are here Mr. And Mrs. Shi are here Mr. Shi can explain for me People of Xueshan School are here to get me Dingding Dangdang, what should we do now? What are you doing? Son, where have you been? I've been learning martial arts with Dingding Dangdang Dingding Dangdang's grandpa wanted to kill me But he couldn't succeed You're from far away, but you have to leave us alone We have something important to discuss We have something to discuss with our Chief Mr. Bei, he's just a kid How can he be your Chief? You should not make him a scapegoat He has made a vow before we elected him He promised to redeem our crimes Chief, is that true? Is it true? I... I don't remember Son, true or not, just say it If you'd made a promise, you have to keep it I... Say, even if it's true, it doesn't matter anymore I don't want to do it now Shut up Son, have you made such a promise? Someone did make a promise. But he's not that person It's him who made the promise! Not him Dad, mom, please help your son So you are our son Mom, how come you don't recognise your son! Dingding Dangdang, you're here too So you are Zhongyu And you've been lying to me all the while Shi Zhongyu, do you recognise me? Uncle Bai, why are you so upset? You little devil You can call me names It's okay to call me little devil But then what is my dad? We've been searching you for two years. Come with us And Chief will decide what to do with you What crime have I committed? They say you've raped Brother Bai's daughter Nobody really knows what happened in a relationship It's her fault, you shouldn't put the blame on me She jumped down the cliff herself, I didn't push her Shut up, you... Mom, why is dad so upset? Son, if you had hurt somebody You should admit it It's really not my fault Quiet, all of you I don't care what's going on amongst you Just don't stop me 107 members of Zhangle Gang deserve to die I bring back your Chief Is he going to redeem your crimes? Or you prefer to die for your own misdeeds? Chief Shi, you have promised us I've made a promise, so what? You think I'm young & naive and would die for you? I'm not that stupid Son, a man ought to keep his promises I can't die for them though! Big Brother, calm down He... is unvirtuous, untrustworthy I don't want a son like him Big Brother, we have only this son We cannot let him just die If your Chief doesn't want to redeem your crimes Then let me kill those 107 persons Those who have nothing to do with this, leave Old sir, do you want to kill people again? Right You should not kill again If you want me to stop killing people Someone must redeem their crimes Then I'll give them 3 years to become good again You've been Chief of Zhangle Gang for a few days If you're willing... Fine, you can kill me, let me redeem for them Great, this is a truly heroic act I'm not a hero, I'm Bastard Sir, we... I made the scars on your body and wanted you to be our scapegoat But you're kind and righteous, we... we're really Get up... Everyone gets up Old sir, if you want to kill me, please do it I don't kill people who don't defend themselves I don't believe there's such a fool in this world Bastard, you're fighting as Chief of Zhangle Gang And I won't be gentle with you I understand Watch out Sir, he attacks your legs Now he attacks your head Old sir, this is yours Mr. Xie, you're a renowned martial arts master and your weapon has been snatched away by this nameless young lad Do you still want to fight? Still, someone has been killed Sir, we took you for another person last time Our apologies It doesn't matter He really looks like me; no wonder you... Chase him... Zhongyu, still want to run away? Brother Bai, let's now take him to Xueshan Mom Okay, you guys go away If our son... has a slightest resemblance to this young hero I should be grateful Chief Please take your seat... No, I can't This time everyone in the Gang sincerely elects you as our Chief Right I don't want to be Chief. I don't even have a name I should leave and look for mom now Chief, don't worry We have good connections and we can help you find out who you really are Do you know where your mom lives? I can't really tell you where the place is I only know... Dingding Why cut off half my name and transform Dingding Dangdang to Dingding You've found your Zhongyu, but I... You're the kind and righteous hero I follow Mr. And Mrs. Shi and the Xueshan group Everyone of them praises you Dingding Dangdang, what's in your mind? I mistook you as Zhongyu, I'm sorry Now you've found him So what? He has only a few days to live How come? Didn't you hear what the Xueshan people say? They said he had done something bad And want to execute him in Xueshan It's all your fault Me... You've upset Grandpa and he left Otherwise I'm sure he can save Zhongyu I... If Zhongyu died, I don't want to live too Even if he deserves this ...it's terrible that his parents have to die too Why? Why not? He is their only son They won'tjust let other people kill him They will take action to save him But there're many Xueshan people and they can't win No way, I have to go to Xueshan as well to help Mr. And Mrs. Shi They are not my real parents But they are kind to me You might not save them Even if you do, they might not want to leave Even Xueshan people might not want to hurt them They might be in deep grief after their son dies and will probably jump the mountains Stop saying that Dingding Dangdang, do you have any good idea? I do have an idea, but you might not want to do it I will do it You look like Zhongyu If you could pretend you're Zhongyu people can't ever discern it That's not a good idea I don't even speak well He's very eloquent I've planned ahead I can put a certain kind of medicine on your throat Then you can't speak People might think you have an open sore and won't get suspicious Then I can leave with Zhongyu to faraway places Okay, I'll do it lt'd hurt when I put the medicine Be patient Chief, it's a trap She only wants you to be a scapegoat No, if I can save Zhongyu I don't mind if I get hurt "Letian Inn" Mr. And Mrs. Shi stay with Zhongyu here They want to keep an eye on him They just want to be righteous heroes and don't care if their son died Mr. And Mrs. Shi are here. That's not easy I have some sleeping incense. Nobody will find us out. What is this? People will fall asleep when they smell it Come here Well, now you're playing new tricks Brother Bai, Zhongyu's throat has an open sore He's not pretending Dingding Dangdang, you're smart And that fool really listens to you That fool looks exactly like you But I'm far smarter than him What that fool did yesterday... greatly benefited Zhangle Gang I can go back and pretend I am that fool Good idea I can be their Chief for sure, come We're fortunate to have you back as our Chief I don't even know my name Maybe I'm not good enough to be your Chief You do have a name, you are Shi Zhongyu Shut up Shi Zhongyu, you can fool other people but not me Old sir, it's me Who are you? I'm Bastard Very good Do you know what Bastard owes me? He owes me his life That's none of my business, I'm Shi Zhongyu You still kill people every day? Yes, so what? You also kill people I only kill those who deserve to die That's what you think Those people didn't think they deserve to die I don't want to argue with a little girl I still have some unfinished business with Bastard So I can't let you mess up with me Let's go Shijian, how do you know he's Shi Zhongyu? Ms Ding takes the real Chief away Then what should we do now? Let's go and find Chief's mom And ask her about Chief's true identity I'm sure we will find out where Chief is It's here What? Your throat has recovered? It's here, I remember it's here After going through this road it's the place where I live with my mom Son, what do you say? I haven't said anything... You're not Zhongyu I am I am Shi Zhongyu No, you're not. Why are you doing this? Dingding Dangdang asks me to Where's Shi Zhongyu then? I don't know. Dingding Dangdang takes him away Don't worry, the world is huge but I'm sure we can find him I used to live upon the hill with my mom I still remember this is the road to the hill Now you all go to look for Shi Zhongyu And I have to find my mom We don't know if or not you're the real Bastard yet So we can't let you go I... Brother Bai Congratulations, Brother Bai Why? Brother Bai, your daughter is still alive The hunters rescued her. She's okay now Brother Bai, this is really good news But I can'tjust forgive that little devil Shi Zhongyu Good, everyone's here Son Bastard, let's go Mr. Xie This young man is a true hero Our son is not Why do you want to take him away? I don't care if he's a hero or not But he cannot leave without me He had returned the Black Iron Token to me So he can ask me to do one favour for him If he was manipulated I might get into trouble Mom Son Old sir, now I want to ask you a favour He has done many bad things because he doesn't have a good teacher Old sir Please let him stay with you So you can teach him how to reform No, mom, please don't let me stay with him Good idea Mr. Xie, this is a promise you cannot break Fine, if you and your wife agree Our son needs good discipline. We have trust in you Come here Mom Zhongyu Let's go Zhongyu I've asked Mr. Xie to take him away So he can learn to be a good person Zhongyu Son Madam Shi She's still worrying and has to say a few words to her son You have benefited us, yet we don't know who you are I want to meet your mother and find out if she was the person I have in mind Then it's better she doesn't go with me We can meet at home later Mr. Shi, it's great if you come with me Fortunately my daughter is still alive And Mr. Xie will impart Shi Zhongyu good discipline Now we can leave and go back to Xueshan Chief, finally we catch up with you You still want to make trouble?
