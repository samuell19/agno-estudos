You want to hear about my past? The past is only the past. The more I talk about it. the more time I'll be wasting. As for now. I'm really happy. I usually wake up at ten in the morning I listen to Mozart as I take a shower. Then I step out of the house. I take my breakfast at the Cafe Madeleine on the corner of 11th Street. Freshly-baked bread and a cup of warm milk. I then walk to the park at 14th Avenue. I need the exercise after every meal. I drop by the dry cleaners on my way back to pick up the clothes I left there. When I sit down on the sofa with a magazine and watch TV. it's almost 3 PM in no time. Then it's almost time to go to work. I eat a piece of cheese and tomato juice for lunch and start putting on makeup. A lot of men come looking for me in the evening. Office workers. Insurance agents. Businessmen. Salesmen. Soldiers. And even students. I sit down. Eat and drink with them and dance the night away. That is happiness for me. No. It can't be. That is not happiness. How could I end up like this? What have I become? It cannot be. No. I don't want it. I can't stand it. I can't stand it! So you want to hear about my past? It happened when I was 16. There are flowers in every tree branch. birds singing inside every bunch. My heart overflowed with happiness and my heart was full of joy. Then a boy came up to me. He had yellow wildflowers in his hands. and he was so shy he was almost in tears as he handed me the flowers with a letter in a dainty envelope. Then the boy disappeared over the fields. These were the words that filled the letter. If it is love like life that you want. I will not love you. for life is as fleeting as a breath. But... Should you want love that is like the soul. then I will gladly love you. for that love would be eternal. You pay me up front. Don't wake me up even if you do first. Because I like sleeping in. Shall I turn the light off now? Uh... Do you have some time right now? I'd like to buy you a cup of tea. Uh... Do you have some time right now? I'd like to buy you a cup of tea. Uh... Uh... Do you have some time right now? I... I'd like to buy you a cup of tea. - Good-bye. - All right. see ya. - Bye now. - Bye. Oh. Hello there. Young-min? It's getting pretty cold now. What? OK... Really? OK. I'll be there. How are you. Young-min? So. did you get a job yet? What? Really? OK. OK. I get it. All right. I'll be there. You're back. It's getting cold. Did you have lunch yet? Of course I did. It's past four already. dad. Take it easy on yourself. No way. I'll keep on squeezing as long as I have the strength. But nowadays. people don't buy freshly-pressed oil like they used to. Sales are dropping. With all these supermarkets popping up. they all buy big brands from factories. I heard it's tough to get a job even with a college degree. The eldest son from the shop next to me applied to the post office and failed. because there were thousands of applicants. All that studying is not doing people any good. But you don't need to worry. You're in Yonsei. Yonsei Business School is the best in Korea. Don't you think about working at bank or places like that. Work for a general trading company It's time to reach out to the world. I want to buy you a drink today. dad. All you've ever told me is to quit drinking. and now you're gonna buy me? Because it's your birthday today. Whatever... Poor chumps like me don't have time to waste on birthday parties. Just one bottle. One bottle. you say? Enough for singing. Pour me some now. How old are you this year. Deok-pal? He's 53. the same as I am. Do you ever think about your wife? What's the use of talking about it? - Here. drink up. - I'm all right. Better get your father married again. Young-min. Stop talking nonsense! My son will do it before me. I'm not getting married again. Do you have a girlfriend? Is there anyone you like right now? There is. Really? - Here. - Yes. What kind of a girl is she? She's a student. Which grade? Is she a senior? Yes. Is she pretty? Yes. How many times did you see her? You must have slept with her. Oh. my God... Did you kiss her yet? Well... I haven't even dated her yet. Uh. oh. This is all one-sided. You are never going to get a girl like that. Young-min. Women only fall for men who never ever give up. Oh. boy... You have to have that poker face. But then you bow down and get on your knees for her. You know. when your dad wanted to marry your mom. there were five other guys in this market who also liked her. You're mother had to work here because of the war. but she was a bona-fide college graduate. She would not have given a day for a lowly man like your dad who didn't - even go to elementary school. - That's enough. - Just drink up. - All right. Yeah. yeah. yeah... Then one day he drank five bottle of soju at once and decided he would die if things didn't work out as he barged into your mom's house. He got down on his knees and said he loved her. that he would make her happy whatever he had to do. and that he would die if he didn't marry her. Hey. man. That actually worked. OK? When the other guys were afraid of even talking to her. your dad beat others to her. Young-min. my boy. just go for it. like your dad. There is no other way. Just go for it. with a true heart. Got that? Do you have any time to spare? I'd like to buy you dinner... Hye-rin? I... I'm a person... Who knows you well. How do you know me? I have seen all your plays. So? Do you have any time to spare? I'd like to buy you a cup of tea. I don't have time. We can meet tomorrow. if you want... I'm busy tomorrow. too. Then the day after is fine. Why are you doing this? I... I have something to tell you. Just tell me right now. Well. not out here. What is it that you want to tell me? I want to tell you that... In person. It will only take a moment. Starting tomorrow. I will be waiting at twelve noon in front of the Doksu Palace every day for one week.. You don't have to come if you don't feel like it. Good bye. Wait. do you know ''The Riverside?'' Yes. I do. Let's meet there at 12 noon tomorrow. Thank you. - Mister? - Yes. sir. - Where is the restroom? - It's over there. Thanks. And if a pretty girl with yellow hair steps in through the door. please tell her - to wait in that table. - I will. sir. I'm late. aren't I? Sorry about that. It's all right. You look good in a suit. - Waiter! - Yes. sir. You should order. right? I'm really sorry. Order what you like. No. I'm not hungry. Beef cutlets are our speciality. - A ham sandwich - Yes. ma'am. - And coffee. - Yes. ma'am. A bottle of beer. please. Would you like an OB or a Heineken? - A bottle of OB. - Yes. sir. Ah. waiter? Would you like something else? No. Now. tell me. Excuse me? You said you had something to tell me. Oh. that's right. This is a comedy script I wrote. My Love. My Bride' I like the title. Thank you. I took it from the Bible. Are you a writer? No. I'm a business major in my senior year. But you write scripts for plays? Well. I actually wanted to be an actor. but I didn't think I had the talent. so I decided to be a writer instead. What is this play about? It's about a man and a woman who were separated getting back - together after ten years. - Enjoy your meal. and spending the night together. Sounds very erotic. Well. not really. Would you like to appear in it if it ever goes on stage? I don't know when that will be. but... Is that really what you wanted to tell me? Yes. I'm leaving for America very soon. So... Oh. to America? Oh... OK. America is a good place. How long have you been chasing me around? What? So you were the one who sent me those flowers. chocolate. and fruit baskets after every play? Oh. I didn't ask your name yet. Kim Young-min. What do you want from me? Mr. Kim Young-min? I... I love you. Hye-rin. I loved you for a long time. I first saw you during my sophomore year. You came to see a play I was in. It was called P.O.W Camp #1 7. Oh... Now I know. You forgot your lines! I think I remember. And the play was over because of it. That's right. I wrote to you a dozen times after that. But I never sent it. I also called you many times. But I hung up as soon as you answered. And so? I would like to marry you. I promise to make you happy. - Is it you? - Yes. dad. - I'm home. - You're a little late. Are you drunk? No. I'm not. - Thanks for the suit. - Yeah. How did it go with her? Did you do all right? Yes. I think it turned out well. - Did you have enough money? - Yes. I even had 300 won left over. I see you drank a lot. No. dad. Just a bottle of beer. Good night. dad. Hey. what did the girl say to you? I did it just like you. dad. I did exactly how you did it with mom. I said I loved her... That I wanted to marry her and that I'd make her happy. - You know what. dad? - What? You know. that girl... She said she thanks me for liking her like that. Well. it went well. then. Here. Then why did she laugh out loud at me? Probably because she likes you. Right. My dear Hye-rin. I read this paragraph from a collection of poems of my favorite poet. That I think of you it will just form a background for you, like the sun setting or the wind blowing, an everyday trifle. If there comes a time when you wander in endless suffering, like the trifle you knew everyday, I will call out to you. I know you told me not to take my feeling for you more than necessary but I simply could not do that. I want to see you again. I will be waiting for you at Doksu Palace at twelve noon this Christmas. Sincerely, Kim Young-min. There's just too much hurt for us to start over. The hurt can't do you any harm. But it leaves a mark. you know. So. I found you at last. I took a hick girl from New Orleans with nothing to her name and cared for her as a husband. and this is what I get? No. no. That's not it. Do it again. What the hell are you doing? Do you call that acting? - Hey. you! - Yes? You drank last night. didn't you? No. I didn't. Then why are walking in like a spineless bum? When a husband finds his wife with another man. shouldn't you be showing some anger? I took a hick girl from New Orleans with nothing to her name and cared for her as a husband and this is what I get? Don't you have to show some temper? Didn't you ever read Stanislawski? Oh. my God! Why must I put up with this? And by the way. Hye-rin... Is something bothering you? You really have to wind down. Relax. OK? Don't forget to relax. I told you so many times already. Your shoulders are too tight. That makes your entire body look stressed-out. When Helen is hugging Fred. she's doing it to express explicitly her anger directed at her husband. So try to loosen up and relax. OK? Relax. Don't forget that now. All right? OK? Keep that in mind now. Everyone. loosen up! Let's do that part over. One more time! Relax. everyone. Action! I never forgot you ever for a day for the last ten years. Helen. let us start over. There's just too much hurt for us to start over. The hurt can't do you any harm. But it leaves a mark. you know. So. I found you at last. I took a hick girl from New Orleans with nothing to her name and cared for her as a husband. and this is what I get? You haven't changed at all. Fred. You are still your old self. Hug him tighter. Hye-rin. Show some real emotion. and relax. What's wrong. Hye-rin? What is it? I'm not doing it. The role just doesn't suit me. We're going on stage in two days. You can't quit now! Whatever. I'm not doing it. Just what is the matter with you? The lines are so cliched. What was that? You think I'm cliched? It's nothing but a 50's-style cheap love story. Don't you know everyone is going ''off Broadway'' now? I expected a Lee Strasbourg or at least a Grotowskursa. Thank you for coming. - Let's go. doctor. - Yes. ma'am. What? You expect to turn into a Hepburn after one lousy play? Oh. my God! Hey. who the hell are you? What are you doing in this theater? Who the hell let this guy in? Get out. I'm having a lousy day. and they tick me off more by letting bums in here. How is it in Broadway? When do the theaters usually open? At Broadway. they never say they open their doors. They say they turn their lights on. Just as the dawn becomes morning. when the light goes on in Broadway. the street that was lifeless during the day starts showing signs of life. Just like the actress waiting for the audience after putting on her makeup. the Broadway dresses itself up in bright lights. and wait for audiences to file in. Actors. singers. dancers. producers. writers. critics. painters. and musicians then get together to debate life and art as they drink the night away. I remember some saying this. Broadway is like a long night train racing without a pulling horse but with its lights on through the dark night of this world and humanity. I'm opening a clinic when I go back. A gynecologist in America can make tons of money. It's too much money for myself alone. I want to use that money on you. invest in your talent. Here's your Christmas gift. I'll get you something much bigger next time. Not a gift. but a wedding ring. Oh. my. Hello. Young-min? How are you. Ms. Joo? What brings you here? I'm seeing my friends here. Watch where you're going! Wait. Young-min. Merry Christmas. You too. Hye-rin. A grown man like you shouldn't be brought down by a cold. You'll be home in a few days. That is. if you can pick yourself up. - Dad. - What is it? - I'm going to get a job. - Oh. OK. Good thinking. That's good. As for the play. you can do it as a hobby. Here. Eat up. Don't want it? By the way. don't apply for banks. Go into one of those trading companies. Big business. It's way better than a bank. Yeah... You have to reach out to the big world now. Into the big world. And I think you should get married early. Try to get yourself married next spring. Earlier you marry. the better. Get married. all right? What do you think of that girl? She has big hands. She could be a big spender. What's wrong with big hands? That means she's a good worker. And the big and wide nose. That's a lucky nose. Stocky and sturdy. too. She'll have babies easily. No. no. You're all wrong. Young-min wants his brides slim and pretty. Shush. Quiet! What do you call it. she should be like... Gina Lollobrigida. At least as pretty as her. Hey. looks don't last in a marriage. She looks plain and homely like an old rice cake. and I bet she's a good girl inside. too. - No problem then. - Young-min finally set his mind on. - Right. - He agreed to a marriage meeting. He would never come if he knows it's a marriage meeting. I just told him to come outside for a moment. He doesn't suspect anything. Just get him married off when you have the chance. You told us he's going to America soon. What if he gets lonely in America and gets married to some blond girl? - No way. - Yeah. How old is the girl? - Her age? - Yes. Her age... Well. I never asked her. Then you're wasting your time. You didn't even check if they were a good match. Wait I didn't ask how old you are. - Twenty-three. - Oh. OK. - Twenty-three. - Twenty-three? Come on in. How are you? Sorry to keep you waiting. - You're all here. - We are. Where's dad? Over here. Young-min. Hold on a second. Young-min. I know your dad didn't tell you. but it was a hard decision. Listen. the way we look at it she looks like a nice girl. You know what you dad went through trying to raise you all by himself. right? Your dad deserves to enjoy his life. All right? Oh... OK. I was wondering why you called me out in such a hurry. Now I understand. Come over here. Well... Sit down. - This is my boy. - I see. This is Mrs. Song. the cousin of the mill owner. Oh... All right. And this is her daughter. I've heard a lot about you. My father made a difficult choice. and it is my duty as a son to follow his wishes. I only regret not having known how my father felt. Well. all right... If you... Really think so... Why don't we snap to it and get it over with before you go out of the country? If you'll only let us... it's not up to me... Well. dad... I really must get going. I have a lot of work at the company. Not so soon... Sit down for coffee. and chat with us for a bit. It's OK. He seems busy. I'm really sorry. I'm really glad to meet you. What the... Congratulations on your marriage, dad. Isn't she beautiful? What would you like to have? - A bottle of beer. - Yes. sir. Would you prefer an OB or a Heineken? - OB. please. - Yes. sir. Oh. my. You work so hard. You're always coming home late. You must have a lot of work to do. Yes. I do. I left the twenty charcoal briquettes you were asking for at your house. - Thank you. ma'am. - You're welcome. Do you have some time to spare this weekend? Why do you ask? I want you to... I want you to meet someone. He's the son of our neighborhood chief. A very diligent young man. He didn't make it to college, but I've heard he's a good technician. He got a lot of money together working in Saudi Arabia. Do you know that big shopping center they're building at the intersection? He's going to open an electronics shop there. How about it? You could go see him if you feel up to it. I don't think I have time. Are you seeing someone already? Look here. mister. How could you bring an umbrella in here? You're getting our stuff wet. The nerves some people have. Anyway. if you're not seeing anyone. do think about it. You can always make time if you want to. A woman has to marry well if she wants the good life. All right? Do think about it. Hello. Sungmoon Company. Is a translator named Joo Hye-rin there. by any chance? Hold on a second. Joo Hye-rin speaking. Is this the restaurant? This is the oil shop. Bring us two bowls of noodles. You have the wrong number. Hello. Sungmoon Company. Uh... May I speak to Ms. Joo Hye-rin? Hold on. Hello? What? What happened? Why don't you make the shipment? We already opened the LC. you know? Next month? No. No no no... Next week. Hurry up. please. OK? They say they'll load it at Suez by next week. But we took care of that already. The documents for the Saudi project. sir. - One instant noodle here. - Yes. sir. It's 600 won for one dumpling. right? That's right. Give me one dish. You don't have to scream. I'm not deaf. you know. Will you just sit still and not move around like that? You don't have hemorrhoids. do you? Could you pass me the soy sauce? Why are you asking for someone else's when you have yours right in front of you? Weirdo. The vinegar. please... Wait... Aren't you Joo Hye-rin. who graduated from Ewha and went to America? I'm Young-min. How are you? What a surprise meeting you at a place like this. I work for a company nearby. OK... You must be back for a vacation. I am. You must be tired of American food. People who lived overseas always ask for noodles when they're back. Could you spare some time for me? I'd like to buy you a cup of tea. Hello. Mr. Kim. It's me. Hye-rin. Yes. I came back a few days ago. I didn't find a musical I liked. so I took the autumn off. But I was so busy last year. I was the queen in ''The King and I''. I had rave reviews from The New York Times. Yes. I'm going back next week. I'll call you before I leave. All right. - I'm sorry. - No. it's all right. The New York Times... If you got your name on the New York Times that is truly awesome. Yes. They called me the Asian Cinderella of Broadway. Julie Joo. the fabulous little angel. That's what they call me there. Oh. Julie... Do you have cigarettes? - A pack of cigarettes. - Yes. sir. We left on a national tour after finishing at Broadway. Boston. Philadelphia. Chicago. Atlanta. and Houston. We had five curtain calls after a show in Philadelphia. Oh. wow. Five times? I'm sorry. sir. But it looks like a blackout. I'm back in Seoul because I missed it. but I have to go back soon. My husband will be back from a seminar in Europe soon. Oh. all right... Thank you for Christmas that year. All right... You sent me flowers... And chocolate. and fruit baskets. You wrote a comedy. right? What was the title? My Love. My Bride That's right. ''My Love. My Bride.'' It was a very beautiful title. Why haven't you married yet? Aren't you being too choosy about women? No... Not really. For the last 3 years. I never forgot about you even for a day. I know you were married to someone else already. But the only thing I wanted was for you to be happy. Then. a few days ago... I saw you on the subway by coincidence. And I thought something bad might have happened... Oh. I almost forgot. I have to call someone. Hold on. Is that you. Young-min? Oh... It's you. dad. What are you doing out here? Go inside. Let's get inside. It's late. You go on ahead. dad. Is something going on? No... It's something bad. right? No. Are you drunk? No. Yes. you are. No. I'm not. Do you remember going to the amusement park when you were five? No. You were scared out of your wits after riding the chair-o-plane. and you peed in my pants. Oh. my God... - Dad. - Yeah? Did you love mom a lot? Your mother? Yes. I loved your mother very much. As much as the sky? It's because of that girl you knew. right? No... But you said she was married. She's alone again. Did you meet her? Yes. You never got over her. did you? No. Do you like her that much? - No. I didn't order anything. - What? But you did. just a while ago. Enjoy your meal. Hey. this isn't for me! Does anyone know a Kim Young-min? Kim Young-min? Who the heck is that? What is this? Does someone know a Kim Young-min? - Not really. - No. It's the same name as my uncle. If you happen to have time today. I'll be waiting at Doksu Palace at 3 PM. I really want to see you. Kim Young-min. Wow. somebody is lucky. Gosh. I almost gave it to the wrong person. Why is that? There were two other women who looked like her. But one of them had glasses on. - So you gave it to the one in glasses? - Well... It's not my first time doing it. Don't worry. It went to the right person. You told me she was a knockout. but she wasn't that pretty. Oh. well. Every man has his tastes. Good work. man. No. that's OK. Just pay me for the food. Good luck. - Thank you. - No sweat. You're not leaving? It's 2:30 already. No. you go ahead. All right. then. I'll get going. See you on Monday. Thank you for coming out for me. Hope I didn't keep you waiting. It's been a while since lunch. I bet you're hungry. Go ahead and eat. I'd like to take you somewhere nice for dinner. Should we go watch a play after that? Right. There aren't many good plays right now. You probably saw lots of good plays in America. Here. I don't feel like it. Well then. Don't' they have sandwiches or burgers around here? They should. with all the foreigners here. What do you want from me? If you're going to talk about marriage. you might as well give up. Because I tried marriage once. and I failed. I don't want to get married ever again. Not with anyone. never again. I have an appointment so I must get going. See you. then... But... You're still beautiful. you know. Do you know what I had to do in America? A waitress. babysitter. bartender. cashier... There were even times when I sat in front of the sewing machine in a factory all day. Do you know why? Someone whom I thought was a rich man was a bum who dropped out of med school. A bum without a job. And I just saw one lousy play at Broadway. One day after I went to America. I just want to be left alone. Try not to call me again. Please. Do you have anything else to say? It's your birthday... Happy birthday. - Hello. - It's me... Young-min. I'm sorry I have to keep calling. but I really want to see you today. I'm busy. I'll wait here until you get off work. outside of your office. I don't know when I'm getting off. Do you like me that much? Yes. What do you like about me? Everything. Look. Young-min. It stopped raining. Oh. it did. Would you... Like to marry me? - How do you feel? - What? I feel great. You're going to Jeju for your honeymoon? Yes. Get it right on first night. OK? The ceremony will begin in a moment. Will our guests in the hallway and in the back place please move forward? The groom Kim Young-min is a graduate of a prestigious university who is a solid professional with a bright future. Will the bride, in fair weather and bad in happy times and sad, in sickness and in health be together as one to love and to cherish till death do you part... Now the father of the groom will give a speech on behalf of families of both the bride and the groom. Our groom was young when he lost his mother. so I'm sure his father is very proud of him right now. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedules to come here. That is all I have to say for today. The bride and groom will now begin their march to a happy marriage. Will the guests please stand up from your seats and give a big round of applause for the bride and the groom? Husband and wife. forward! Would you like your underwear? I... I'm fine. Oh. the movie of the week is not on TV today. Hello. This is Room 312. We want to go see the sunrise in the morning and have to get up early. so call us at 5 o'clock. Thank you. The moon is so bright. isn't it? Is it full moon already? The moon in Seoul was never this bright. Maybe it's because the air's so clean here. I really thank you. If we met a little earlier... Darn. it sure brings back memories... She has such a fine voice. Doesn't she? Come on. She's pouring you a drink. I heard Young-min talk about her a few years back. It was right here where I told him what to do. Just go for it. with a true heart. Did he show you his true heart? Oh. my. I didn't get a good look at her at the wedding hall. but she is so pretty up close. Enough of your antics . Oh. Lord... Come on. Deok-pal. Your beautiful daughter-in-law wants you in the same house. but why do you insist being alone. you stubborn jerk? Well. because I want to enjoy my time alone. Enjoy. my butt. You stubborn old goat. - Young-min. - Yes. sir. You must be having a good time with your wife. You look a lot thinner suddenly. Oh. my God... Come on. - Uh... Dad? - What? - I have something to tell you. - Is it about the company? No. Well. it's not a big deal... What is it? - Sorry... I'm sorry... - What is it? - She's pregnant? - Yes. - Are you sure? - Absolutely. You are pregnant already? Wait... I hope it didn't happen before the wedding. - Congratulations. Deok-pal. - You're going to be a grandpa. Let me take a look at you. - You look seven months old. - Yes. - I can see you like babies. - Indeed. Come here. Wow. look at these hands. Bigger than a bear paw. And let's see... You have big ears. too. I bet you'll make general someday. She's a girl. Well. aren't you the pretty princess? I know you'll be Miss Korea when you grow up. Oh. no. She peed on you. Oh. no. I'm sorry. What do I do? Oh. boy... Let's take a look. You took a pee on me. - Joo Hye-rin? Ms. Joo Hye-rin? - Here. Come in. See you. Oh. my. You did a pee-pee. Did you make your decision? Take your clothes off and go to the next room. Who are you? I am Joo Hye-rin's husband. You are? So? I don't drink nor smoke. For the good of my wife. I do all the hard work in the house. I even do the laundry and make dinners. too. For the mother and the fetus' emotional development. I leave classic music on all the time. Mostly Mozart and Brahms. Tell me what I should know as a father who has to keep his wife and baby safe. - Take a seat. - Thank you. - Are you the only son? - Yes. I am. I cannot believe a young man like you could be so old-fashioned. Does carrying on your family line mean more to you than the life of your wife? You are despicable! She has experienced two stillbirths already. How could a husband be so barbaric as to demand a baby from a wife with toxemia of pregnancy? Your wife could die from having this baby. She has high blood pressure and a bad heart. And she was advised to have an abortion a long time ago. and yet you go on about keeping the mother and baby safe and all that nonsense? It may be a little late but bring her in right now and tell her to have an abortion. What are you waiting for? Go on! Honey. can I see you during lunch tomorrow? I went out to the market and saw something today. A chestnut-color coat with checkerboard patterns. I think you would look great in it. But I didn't unwrap it because I wasn't sure you'd like it. If you like it. buy me cold noodles. How about it? Do you like it? Here. Oh. my God. You've gained a lot of weight. You might get a pot belly. Try to move around while you work. Oh. and your father dropped by in the afternoon. He gave us three bottles of pressed sesame oil. Our baby is going to be born in winter. I heard winter children are talented in the art. Would you like a boy? Or a girl? Since you're not answering. it means you want a boy. But don't be disappointed even if I have a girl. The doctor called today. She said you dropped by. Don't worry about it. I have had stillborn babies before. but they never lasted more than five months inside. This is my sixth month. I'm certain this time. I am not afraid. No. You have to go to the hospital. Do you love me. Young-min? Yes. Then let me have the baby.
