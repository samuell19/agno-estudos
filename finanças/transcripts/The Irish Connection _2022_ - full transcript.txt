- "Don't think I will kiss you, "although you need to be kissed badly "and that's what's wrong with you. "You need to be kissed and often, "and by someone who knows how." - I know it, I know it. - That wasn't the one I was originally gonna go for, but you're a bit too good at this game. - Gone with the Wind. - Yeah. This is definitely your game. - My turn. "I have this little problem. "I have a stalker and I need a cover. "I need for you to pretend we're having "a scintillating conversation "and that you are wildly entertained." - Damn you might have got me on this one. Uh... Vanilla Sky. - Much better than me. - "See your problem, "is you're beautiful. "You have beautiful legs, beautiful body, beautiful face. "And all these guys in love with you. "But you have a look in your eye. "Like you haven't been fucked in a year." Something tells me that was a little bit too close to home for you, was it? - It's fine. Scarface. - You are a proper geek, aren't you? - I try not to disappoint. - Right, I'm gonna take a piss. What? It's better out than in, isn't it? It was a roomy dinner. - Little more information than I needed, but you go right ahead. - How well do you know that girl? - Sorry, what'd you say to me? - How well do you know that girl? - What the fuck is this? - The girl's a spy, Rory Baker. - Hold on, I know you. Brody, yeah? Just outta prison. Tell me do you fancy going back in, do ya? - Prison's not a very nice place. No friends in there, locked up in a tiny cell with all your freedoms taken away. She set me up, Rory. - Hey. - See, she's not who she says she is. Bruised egos repair themselves. You should call your brother-in-law. - My man here can look after anything. - A gun pointed straight at your soft tissue, small, but without immediate medical assistance, survival's looking pretty grim. Oh, Rory? He didn't wanna hang around after we told him who you were. - Charlotte Green. - That's not someone who's very high on our Christmas card list. Where is she? - Behind a desk. She didn't take to field work. - Unlike you. Device. Now! - Gun possession. Threatening an agent. That's 20 years at least. - I'll take my chances. - You left so soon. - Sorry darling, you're just you're not my type. - Like you had a chance. You'll shoot your balls off keeping your gun there. - I like to keep it handy. Come on, little girl. We don't even know what agency you're from. - Please don't do this. - Well, where's the fun in that? - Should have taken your keys. - You're no sport at all. I was planning to jump out and test your reflexes. I do have a present of sorts for you. It's an anti-banana disguise. - My hand hurts, what do you want? - I want a debrief on your mysterious priest and the 500,000 pounds in negotiable bearer bonds. Did you just roll your eyes? - This is my home, Miranda. - Please don't shed a tear for that low life. He was hardly the cure for cancer. - It's C1 and C2 complete. That means his spinal cord's so broken, they'll never be able to fix it. - So take the counseling being offered and get over it. Regardless of what happened, you did well. Rory and his crew were being pimped by your priest. This is the job, Aureille. You want to save the world. I empathize. - I was just showing off. He called me 'little girl.' - Interesting trigger. One of my pet names for you. Look, Astin Brody's retired another field operative to a desk. If you want, you can join Charlotte Green. - I have no interest in joining your babble of bimbos. And we broke up, it happens. - I wouldn't dare call you a bimbo. And you broke up with me. - You were cheating. - Well, don't judge me. I was bullied as a child, it made me open to flattery. You blew a six month undercover operation, tracking me going to a hotel. - And you couldn't resist a mousy 21-year-old, because you were bullied. - Abuse of agency resources is gross misconduct Aureille, and the only reason you weren't pulled up on charges was that I intervened. - You didn't do that for me. - Why don't you curse? I haven't heard you say a 'fuck' or a 'shit' in all these years. I assure you it feels great. Real people curse, Aureille. - Bite me. - That's still not a curse. ♪ Here comes Skippy carrying and his pool cue ♪ ♪ Into the chippy fresh from the dole queue ♪ ♪ Good days, he's finally got some work ♪ ♪ He's a good looking fella ♪ ♪ And it says so on his new t-shirt ♪ ♪ And there goes Betty off to the bingo ♪ ♪ Hope she gets a sweaty ♪ ♪ Hope she knows the lingo ♪ ♪ Eyes down, no more smokey lights ♪ ♪ With the snowball in her bag ♪ ♪ She's going out tonight ♪ ♪ These are times of temptation ♪ ♪ Everybody's on a mission ♪ ♪ We're livin' in a fake museum growing further apart ♪ ♪ But we are all individual works of art ♪ ♪ We are all individual works of art ♪ ♪ Oh yes we are ♪ ♪ These are times of transition ♪ ♪ Everybody's on a mission ♪ ♪ We're livin' in a fake museum growing further apart ♪ ♪ But we are all individual works of art ♪ ♪ Skippy spies Betty buyin' a Bacardi ♪ ♪ Sneaks up like a yeti ♪ ♪ Invites her to a party ♪ ♪ Oh man, he's layin' on the charm ♪ ♪ Oh man, he's layin' on the charm ♪ ♪ And she knows she wants to go ♪ ♪ But she thinks she'll let him twist her arm ♪ - You fuckin' maniac you... - What's up, you?

You stood right there and promised us. - You're technically not witnesses, I'm sorry. - You have no clue or even understanding of the risk we're taking even talking to you. Jump in anytime. - I mean, we're not technically witnesses, so. - Don't listen to him. Look, we have no idea where he is. - The priest is protected by Bishop. - That caped-crusader is stonewalling me. - She's upstairs. Room four, but she's with a client now, so maybe give her a moment. - Oh there's no talking to muscle, I'm afraid. - Nice line. - Where do we go? What do we do? - You need to leave town. I don't know for how long, but at least until after I've put these guys away. - Come on dad, I mean we, we could do with an holiday, so. - Shut up, Jay. You're not thinking with a right head. It won't be a holiday. We'll be looking over our shoulders the whole time. You involved us. This is your doing. - All right, just, come, well, you're... you're being a bit harsh now. Just, don't listen to him okay? I actually got you a little something. Just... - The priest had accomplices. - And? - Jay won't thank you, trust me. - You said you preferred silver to gold. - We were talking about conductors in headphones. - Yeah, it's just a little something. - Thank you. - We're done here. - Hello? - Hi Jay, I was just thinking about you. - It's not really a good time, babe. - It's just that you haven't been by in a while. - Thought you said I was a bit creepy. The whole staring thing. - Well, you know I was just having a bad day. You know you are my favorite client. - Uh, gotta go. - That enough? - We got him. Hope that was good for you, love. - I bloody told you to get rid of that phone. - It just rang okay. What you want me to do? - You could have just taken the SIM out and kept the phone! This is not my fault, okay? - No, it's that bloody agent's fault. - She is trying her best. - You're barking up the wrong tree there. It's embarrassing. - What's that? - What's it look like? An inconspicuous car. - And where are we supposed to put the bags? - The other choice was walking. You've been watching the building? - It's been clear, okay? The last couple of hours, anyway. - I'm not having that. She ain't a dike. - She used us. - Oh, what, like that asshole priest you're related to? - I wasn't there for your brother. He had too many temporary goals. - Half-brother, and that's just guilt talking. - So yous are off then? - Aye, thanks for everything. - Oh yes, especially those breakfasts. - This should cover the costs. - Oh, there's no need for that. - No, we'll not be coming back. I'm settling the bill. - The bill? - For the bed and breakfast. - The bed and breakfast is next door. - Who is it you think we are? - You're Margaret's friends from Westway. - Maggie, it's Maggie. - Bloody Maggie, ain't it. - Was her passing sudden was it? - Aye, very sudden. - Yeah, you could say we're only just finding out about it. - Right. I'm gonna turn round, don't you be long. - Okey dokey. - Quick as you can, hurry up. - Here. - Where's your dad? - I dunno what you're talking about. - I'd smack you about, but I don't believe in cruelty to animals. - Oh fuck, me bollocks. - Go, go go, go, go, go. - Who are you? - Morning, landlord. - Something wrong with your eyes, Father? - How you doing? It's hot in here, isn't it? I think you should pop around later. Looks like you've got a bunch of sins to confess. - Don't be cheeky. Sure you won't stay for a pint, Father? - Nope. Just here for some bread. - I am my father's pride and joy and will marry well, but in the meantime, I'm sure I've got a free afternoon. - Business first. Guten tag. ♪ Make it your goal to be at peace with your soul ♪ ♪ Who are you ♪ - How you feeling? - Kicking a lot. - Think it's a boy? - No. - Let me present to you, the gang who could not shoot straight. - You homesteaders have been talking out of school. - No, no I've not said nothing to nobody I promise. - You were warned to stay away from the agent. Tell them. - Oh, that's my line. Yous were seen. - Look, we have no idea where he is. - The priest is protected by Bishop. - That caped-crusader is stonewalling me. - Now I wanna list of the topics you had in conversation with that agent. And I want it now. - Rory, the stupids don't understand, try using words of one syllable, shouldn't be a stretch for you. - Casper on my signal I want you unleash hell. After that, I'll tell you if they're wearing women's underwear or not. - Daniel will never give up his favorite son. Will you old man? - Bearer bonds worth 500,000 pound. That will buy a whole lot of pain, you know. - I'll give him up. - Jay, shut up. Alice. Alice, listen to me. I'm just a father. I wanna make sure my son's safe. That's all, nothing about you or your family. I promise. - So, you were warned old man. You know what? Nothing spoils a target better than a hit. - Fuckin' hell, he shot me! - Jesus, Rory. - Fuckin' toe off... - You see, you shoot a man's toe off with his pants down, And believe me, Texas is not the place that you wanna be caught in. - He said church protection. - Yeah, well that's just not gonna fly. 'Cause that's not a real fuckin' priest. - Enough, Rory. - They think he's real They think there's papers to prove it. - If the church is protecting him the priest is lost to us. - Oh, I will get the bishop to talk. I'll get the bishop to talk. The priest is my half-brother. - Huh, stupid has a point. - The bishop won't roll over on his own clergy. - Well that just pisses me off, doesn't it? - What do you think, Casper? - I think we should drip dry 'em. - It was a rhetorical question. Let me do the thinking. I'm gonna charge the stupids with bringing back the priest, offer them their lives in exchange for the bearer bonds. Um... - What we have here is a failure to communicate. - The moment he tells you anything you're in danger. - Yeah, but what's to stop us just disappearing? You could come with. - Trust me, that's an amazing idea. There are too many ghosts in my life. - Maybe someday. The quiet life. No, no, no, no... Wait! What was that look about between you and her? - Nothing. - It's five nothings since before we left, must be something. - It has a tracker. You dump it, I'll kill you at the first opportunity. - What you've just done there is probably, one of the most idiotic things I think I've ever seen. In fact everyone in this building, is a little more stupid because of it. - You're a sad, strange little man. And you have my pity. I'm the boss, accept it. And he is not leaving my sight. - It's the birth of me son, Rory. It's important. - You gonna follow stupids on your own, no? Didn't think so. - All right, let me take the lead on this. - Okay. - 'Cause you always take the... what? - Okay. - Yes! - What's the crack? - What the hell are yous two doing here? Get out, both of you! - No, no, steady on, Father, okay, 'cause- - I am not a fuckin' priest, you gobshite. I am a fuckin' bishop. And you address me as your eminence, or indeed, your grace. - Okay, your grace, then. Just, where, where is he? - Out, about east. - Stop, we've got a right to know. - Why's your monkey doin' all the talking? - Jay's taking the lead here. - Oh, moving up in the world, Jay. I told your father long ago, you're gettin' nothing of me. - Sorry to bother you, your grace. I noticed you got some uninvited guests. - They're just leaving. - I'm Sister Assumpta of the five ones. Why don't we chat outside? - Hell of a grip. - Mother Superior always said I was a nun on the run, but I loved extra help. And so not sure what I could run from. - See them out, Sister. - No, no, no, no. I lost a toe 'cause of that bastard, so- - Right, you went there? - No, I'm sorry, your grace. Look, our lives are on the line here. - The show's over. Get out the both of yous. God bless and all that. - Boys, yous have said your piece. - You're making a mistake, though. Father! - Your brother is in Malta. I don't want you to get killed, Jay. The Bishop's a proud man. There are people eager to attack the Bishop. I just don't want his reputation soiled. - Thank you, Sister. - Game on, father of mine. - You can wipe that smug look off your face for a start. - I'm Kool & the Gang, mate, but that bastard owes me a toe. - And that was my OBE. - Order of the British Empire. - Mm, I love an intelligent woman. Smart is so sexy. - You have to go. - Who is it? - Miranda, I know you're in there. - She can't find you here. - Can't you just tell her? - Are you a complete moron? I'm your boss. This bitch will use that against me. Fuck off. What do you want? - Where is she? - Who? - Oh, I've seen this seduction before. You are bloody predictable, if not original. - Still haven't quite got the hang of cursing. - Why have you been ignoring my voicemails? - You're not going to Malta. - The priest is there with the bearer bonds. - Yes, and he's being chased by Alice Baker and her motley crew. How's the counseling going? - I heard you've been getting updates. - That's illegal. Those sessions are private and confidential. That being said, there are a few raised eyebrows over ending your career progression. - Fast-tracked by your helping hand. Part of the seduction. - That is a serious accusation. - Authorize my trip to Malta or I go off book. - Oh, going rogue. How very daring. Then again, I never could trust you to do what you're told. - That's your thing, isn't it, Miranda? Control. Bullies, love control. I, uh, checked the old school records. It gives me chills thinking of you in total control. - What are you doing? - Miss being this close to you. - Don't tease me, I won't change- - Authorize my trip. - And if I do? - Goodbye, Miranda. - Oh, Jesus. - Would you forget about my sister? This is down to me. Just get me the damn flight to Malta. I don't care how much it costs, just do it. - Sorry I was late, alarms were going off and- - What the fuck is wrong with you? - I was planning on telling you. I'm not feeling well. - Are you pregnant? I don't give a shit how you're feeling! - Stop! Would you calm down, will ya? - We're under a microscope and I've gotta hear on the street that you roughed up some punk in a club. - Fuck's sake, Casper always- - Don't blame fucking Casper. Harry comes to me, tells me the police got a description and the make of your car. Why don't you give them a fucking urine sample? - The priest was the one who was- - Shut up. That priest outsmarted you every step of the way. Now I hear your booking flights to Malta. Shut up! People that do that wanna get caught. - You think I just want to get caught? - Yeah, you wanna get caught. I've seen it all before. Fucking cowboy act. You just wanna be a big, bad guy already. - No, I- - Shut up! - These stupids are gonna mess up everything, I'm telling you. - Put 'em on the screen. Have yous got the packages. - Mm, yeah, just a quick one. You, you see this? Like who... can't get it out, um, uh, who's is this? Like where, where am I gonna drop this? - It's your per diem. - Absolutely. Yeah, it's my per diem. With you there, but where... who's gonna get, who am I dropping this off to? - It's yours. You keep it. - What this is mine? - Fucking idiots. - Do you get one? - Yeah. - Keep your phone charged. I want those bearer bonds, and I want that fucking priest. - Yeah, so crystal... With ya, crystal clear, yeah. - You don't speak to anyone while you're working, and when you're not working, you're on call 24 hours a day. Don't get drunk or do anything that prevents you from operating in a professional manner. Now tell that back to me. - You want us to, first of all, check out the... - Let him tell me. - Oh yeah, no, I got it. I'm with you. Got it, got it. - Tell me. - I don't really know why you've... Why are they picking on me. - Because your fucking brother stole my fucking bearer bonds and I don't like you, you cocksucker. - It's my half-brother. - We're on it. - Come here. You are in for it now, you are. - Yeah, not if I get you first. - Ah, you horny little devil. - You promised to take me shopping. - Stop being so fucking relentless with that, Agnes. I'm working on it. - Yeah, and you've been saying that for weeks. - Ah, fuck. - What, why are you leaving? You said we had all afternoon. - I've got somewhere to be. Stop acting like a little child. - Where the hell were you? We had to get the boss. Who's the tart? - Just a local. - Dick. - Whore trouble. So my dear, tell your brother where you were. - I felt it better than drawin' attention to us. - How are you brother Kraut? - We didn't get the money. What did my brother say? - Wee shit's workin' with Alice Baker. - Shit! - Your father too, apparently, by all accounts. - No, not my father. They must have turned up the pressure on my old man. - You act naturally as if there's nothing wrong. We can't let them know that we made a deal with a Kraut. - I got mass in half an hour. - Message the Kraut. Tell him I'll meet him after. - Nice pinny. Is my sister home yet? - No. - Well, then I accept your invitation to come in. - She'll be back in a minute. - Slap the kettle on. Silence is deafenin'. And you know what? - And? There's no problem. - Alice has set this up. A bastard priest, the bearer bonds. - The priest stole 'em from you. - Alice is losing her mind 'cause of this pregnancy and you, you're no help. You know, we take care of that priest and everyone else will fall into line. - Oi, Alice is the boss. - Yeah, and she's months off from maternity. Then it's just you and me, brother. Telling you, we do this right, We play this whole town like a fiddle. We hit Malta running, yeah? Take care of the priest. Get the bearer bonds and nothing else matters. - I can't go to frickin' Malta. The birth of me son. - She won't even know that we're gone. We're back tomorrow, and boom. - If I miss the birth of my son, I'll kill you. - It's a fair, fair deal. Come on Casper. You know this makes sense. - All right, I'll do it. But, I'm taking me foot massager and me Austrian Christmas music. - Hey honey, I'm home. There you are, I was wondering... Why are you blocking the door? - Sorry, I was just folding some clothes. - I'm so tired. Traffic was a nightmare down the road. Has my brother been here? - No. Listen, I am taking you out for dinner tonight. - Ah, I'm beat Casper. - Oh, come on. I've booked a table and everything. - What? No, I'm not made up to go out. - Oh forget the Oompa Loompa look. You look fantastic without makeup. - I'm not going anywhere without my face on, Mister. Okay, okay. I'll go if you give me a foot massage. My feet are killing me. Oh. Yeah, that's good. Mm, just there, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh my, oh babe that is really doing it for me. Come here. I'm wearing your favorite underwear. - What about the baby? - Sh, doctor says it's fine. - There is no choice. - 'Cause you'll always choose him. 'Cause he's your favorite. - I'm not listening, I'm done with this. - Ah, I know what you're thinking. Yeah, yeah, yeah. You're thinking when all the dust settles and that we're gonna go back and we're just gonna play happy fams. I-I'm telling you now that is not gonna happen. - He deserves another chance. - Ah, yeah, you just remember who stuck by you all these years. - As if you'd let me forget it. - Here you are. You're on the front cover, you dick. - Right, when we get in there, I'm gonna do the talking. - How'd that work out before? - You said I could take the lead. - All right, all right. - In the name of the father, the son, and the holy spirit. Amen. - Sweet Jesus, Jay. You almost gave me a heart attack! - Sorry about that, Father. - Right? Mass is over. There's no confession tonight. - So what's the crack, then, brother? - Jay. What happened to your foot? - Rory shot me. We almost died 'cause of you, you fuckin' asshole. - I bet there was a woman involved. - Oh, don't, I, okay... I'm not the only one who knows you're here, you're here. Yeah, that Alice, Alice Baker. She knows you're here as well. - That's a horse of a different color. - No, I'm taking you back. You and the bastard bearer bonds, we're gonna... What, just like that? - Do you want me to beg and plead? - Yeah, be a start. - All right, all right, wait there. I'm gonna get my keys from the vestry. - No, but wait, hang on! Slippery bastard, get back here. Fuck. - Are you all right in there, Father? - Yes, just, just looking for my keys. - The door appears to be locked, Father. - It's a bit heavy. - Wanker. - Is the front door locked, Father? - Hello, Dad. - Wait, wait! - Ladies, put the handbags away. Hey, hey, hey. Hey, you have had your say. - All right, I'll buy some pints. Start over. - You're gonna let him get away with this, ain't you? - He said he's sorry. What more do you want, jam with it? We get somethin' to eat and we're gone. Agreed or we leave. - It's all right, landlady. It's only me. - Oh, hello, asshole. I mean, Father. Didn't realize it was you. I thought it was just one of the normal people. Take any table you want. - Ah, Jay. - What's up with her? Don't ask. Is there any table service in this place then? - What do you want? - Gorgeous, gorgeous Gilman. Meet my brother Jay. - Oh, another asshole. - Yeah, she seems to know you. - We're only after a menu. - What do you think then, bruv? - Seems to like you. Got no idea why. - Right, then, Agnes. I guess it's pints all around, then, yeah? - Hey, let's not. It'll not go well. - All right. You guys caught me fair enough. Round of applause. You can't deny a dead man walking his last pint. - I would. - All right, what will make you happy then, Agnes? - Hmm, your head on a stake. - I'll have the super duper hot dog surprise, with extra mustard. What's the surprise? - That you're even getting one. - Same. - I'll take the same as well. - Lose the ridiculous costume. She still thinks you're a priest. - Listen, she's into authority figures, all right? - You're not gonna give him back, are you? - Of course he is. I've got confidence that our father has got this cunning, masterful plan. - Alice Baker and her gang are miles away. - We are gonna hand the bearer bonds back to the agent. - Of course. But I'm not handing him over. - You think this agent has got this lucrative government witness protection and a house out in the suburbs. For what? For a monthly salary bonus? You're smarter than that. - We're technically not witnesses. - Oi, go easy. - What? - The car, big deposit. - Why did you hire a sports car, anyway? - You wanna drive around in crap, you hire it. Shirt's sticking to me. How far to the hotel? - There's no hotel. We have a flight in the morning. - I need a fucking shower, Rory. - I don't get this country. There's no signal anywhere. I mean, if we can't have a signal, we don't find these idiots. - Wifi at an hotel. - Touche, touche. The wifi is shit in here. - Need to do it old school, Rory. With our feet. - Old school. Nah, spoil the leather on your shoes doin' that. I mean, I'm getting wifi, but I'm not getting any signal off it. Here, you have a new phone. Give us that. - Phone's switched off. - Porquoi? - Alice don't know where I am. - Don't tell me she's tracking you. You put up with that shit. Fuck, just give us it. Only two minutes, I'll switch it right off. Come on, it's the least you can do after recent trauma you put me through. - No. - Just give us your fuckin' phone. - No! - The faster we find these two idiots the faster you can go home to your crazy wife and your new unborn family. - Two minutes and turn it off straight after. - Thank you. Very nice of you. - My brother turned up unexpectedly. If you've got it all then we can make the exchange. Half. Are you havin' a fuckin' bubble about half? I want it- - Listen, you dumb Kraut. Don't mess us about or I won't be pleased. Give us our money or we walk. - Why are they here? - Clearly Rory doesn't trust you. - Okay, but is it just my brother he doesn't trust or is it us as well? Look, can you get us out of this? - The bearer bonds have to go back, Jay. If the priest testifies, we might be able to do a deal on a lower sentence. - He's not a priest, is he? - Quiet life is very appealing right now. - I know it's not gonna happen. - Jay, you should know that the priest isn't running this. - I mean, I had my suspicions, but makes sense. You know, he always was the favorite. - He stayed to protect you. - No, it was probably guilt though, wasn't it? - I'll be on the docks in an hour. Quiet life. - What's up with you? - Mixed signals. I'm gonna go. - She told you, didn't she? - I've got nothing to say to you right now. - It isn't how it was. - I'm just gonna go. Drain the lizard. - All right, lads. What can I get for you? - Conversation with these two? - I did my best for you. - Yeah, why doesn't it feel like that, then? - You're owed an explanation, obviously. - You never hit a man with glasses. You hit him with a baseball bat. - Do you wanna explain to me how, how all of a sudden you are some sort of Je m'appelle big bollocks asshole arch criminal, 'Cause I dunno how I'm goin' about my business, and all of a sudden, my brother's a fucking priest and you are like Al Capone! What the fuck? Seriously? What the fuck? - Boys! Boys. - Hey, would you give us a minute, please? - Go on then, pipe up, I'd fucking love to know. - I'm fed up with this, now I'm goin' home. I'm goin' home, seriously. - I give up. - Oh, you didn't turn it off you tit! - Do I look like an arsehole? - Hello, baby. - Don't hello, baby me. What are you doing in Malta? - Ah, well, Rory- - Rory? I'm gonna kill him and then force feed his carcass to you. - I'm really sorry, baby. But the signal. - Casper, don't you dare. - You, you're breaking up. You're break, breaking. - Fucking... - Whoa, Casper! What the actual fuck? - You killed my boy! - Oh, shut up! - Can we find the priest old school, using our feet. - That's just great. That's just fucking great. ♪ Hold on to your love ♪ ♪ I'm a believer ♪ ♪ I believe in love ♪ ♪ Ain't gonna deceive ya ♪ ♪ And I know that love is ♪ ♪ Expressing what love is ♪ ♪ And I know my heart will be true ♪ - Looks like something you enjoy. - Hardly rocket science. The priest was in here the other day with two family members, but I didn't see any resemblance. - Will you tell me where he is? - I dunno. Sorry. He's a shit, but I like him a lot. - Please. - I can't. Oh, for God's sake. - I'm gonna kill that bastard priest and you shortly after. - Please Jay, let me explain. - I don't want to hear it. Just gonna be another load of old bollocks. - Clothes, clothes! - Somebody will see us! - No, no, we grab the clothes and we just, we scarper, we run really fast and... - Jay, I was doing it for the family. - No, you just exclude me from your family. Abort! Abort! Abort! - I hate clowns. - No, not the clown, the clobber. This is perfect! - I'm not wearing that! - You, you're putting it on! Now! - You know, if you kill a priest in a church you go straight to hell. - You're not a priest. - I wear the collar. I represent Jesus on earth. Now that's a fact. - Oh, yeah, a fact. I love facts. How about I've got a nine millimeter gun pressed just above your kidneys, and if I pull the trigger, the bullet will rip through several of your nonvital organs and it'll take you up to three days to die? That's a fact. - Why did you tell Jay? - Because he was a good person. - He's not dead. I just don't feel it. - Where are the bearer bonds? Show me. - Holy mother of mercy I'm going to hell for that one. - I'm not judging or condoning any hitting of a woman, but great to see you, Sister. - Rory and Casper are here. - Yeah, I know. They killed my father and my brother, according to her. - We have to lose the costumes, we'll be too easy to spot. - We'll dump them after the Germans hand over the cash. - How much? - Half. - Fuckin' half? - Your grace, there're clowns watchin' us. - Fancy seein' you here, Father. - I am a fuckin' bishop. - What have you done to her? - Is she is alive? - I hope so. - Forget the agent, Jay. Have you made up with him? - He won't let me explain. - No, no, and I won't either. - 'Cause you're... oh, you are a pair of bastards. - She's coming around, Sister. Hit her again. - Don't you dare. - I won't, I promise! - Hm, now the tables have turned now, ain't they? Give me that bag. You all stay, you'll stay, just... You'll be okay. You all stay there, I'm very angry. - I'm a fuckin' bishop ya wee shite! - How are you feelin'? Sorry about the bump on the head. - I know you, Marguerite Ogle, eight years of forgery. Mark Ogle, serial con man. - I can't go back to prison, I can't. - Get on a plane and go home. If I ever see either of you again... - Hand me that bag, Jay. - No, no... - Please, Jay! I'm not an arch criminal, I'm just a father trying to do his best. - Dad, this was not your best. - Would you prefer me in prison? - Yeah, yeah! You know, I nearly died. So yes, yes I would. - I think you owe Jay a solid. I thought you were dead, yeah. - We're in trouble. - Okay, get a car. Meet me on the coast road, north exit. - This will not end well. - Hang on lads. I have an idea. Follow me. - No, no but Aurielle needs our help! - She can take care of herself! Come on! - Jay, you're up. - I can't hot wire it, the fuck? What's that? It's silly, crazy silly. Space car, bollocks. - What's the story, Jay? - Just gimme a minute! - Fellas, oh fellas. Looks like he's coming for his lunch time snack. - Come on! - I've got it, get in the fucking back, come on! Look, look, we need to go back for Aurielle. - Sex appeal, Jay. It's all sex appeal! The agencies have always played for keeps. - Yeah, yeah, yeah. And they threw me off a bastard cliff in me fucking pants, I totally understand, all right? - In your pants? - Don't you dare laugh, I am a grown man! - Jay, Jay, stop it Jay! For the love of Jesus, the two of yous... - Toodle-oo. - Stop right there! - I've got the bearer bonds. It's just the priest and the dad. - The troops are on their way. Mission complete, Aurielle. How could you hand in your resignation? The agency plays for keeps. - Why do you even care? - Because I'm an Oxford educated visionary, and you're a fucking idiot who never figured out that all these flash moves are better on a chorus line. - Charming, thank you. - Jay can't save you. - No, but I can save him. - Good luck with that. - All right, I deserved that, yeah? I understand that, Jay. - Just wait, this is not finished. Shit. - You're mine now, you fuck. - They're shooting! Bastards! - Will you stop firing at me fucking car? - Bastards! - Oh, Hallelujah. - Asshole. - You're being a baby. - Hm, you like her don't you? - I have not forgiven you yet. - I know. - It's just a graze, but keep it clean. Jay, there's a hotel by the coast. They're friendly, you can go there. How are you doing? - Yeah, strangely all right. - Keep it clean. - If he doesn't, will he die? - It might take awhile. - We've got time. - Where's the troops? - They're on their way, but you need to hide from Rory and his pet gorilla. - Oh, fantastic. She is amazing. - Yeah, I know. - What? - Fuck's sake. - That agent, she was easy on the eye. - Hey, no, no, no, no. You don't get to talk about her, ever. - We had this moment, you know, look. I'm saying she didn't give- - Seriously, you want to start again? Are we doing this again? - The both of ya. - It's like a long weekend with Zippy and Bongo. Can't take a joke. - Give him some space. In fact, the both of us. - You're the one that decided to go back and protect him. - I saw what you did with the bearer bonds. - Well, bang goes me deposit. Fucking big deposit. - Yeah, think on the bright side, you know, it used to symbolize how much you earned, now it symbolizes how much you owe. - What? This is all your fault. - My fault? I didn't steal the fuckin' car, did I? Look, we'll get someone to fix it, don't worry. - Geez. - So you're returning me calls now, are you? Yeah, relax. We have them in our sights. Oh, uh... Casper, it's a boy. - Alice? Alice! She fucking hung up. Told me not to bother going home. - That's, it's probably just the heat of the moment. It'll be fine when we get back, you know? Look, you always wanted a boy, didn't you? So congratulations. Hey man, I'm sorry, I... - Fuck you! - Casper, come on. - Fuck you. - Fuck you going? - Fuck you! - Casper! Oh, for God's sake, Casper. - Jay, I'm sorry man. - You were told to be quiet. - All I was trying to do was apologize. - I know the value of your apologies. - All right, you guys go ahead. Give me two seconds, man, I just want to pee. - Oh, for fuck's sake, just... - Well, well, well. Where's the priest? - I killed him. - I've met many men, done many deeds. You two are not cruel. Where's the fucking bonds? - Killed them too. Do you know, I'm, I'm actually just a bit, a bit fed up with this mate. You're, you're, you're... doing my nut right in. Yeah, tell you what, tell you what, if you carry on the way you're going, then, then I'm gonna kill you too. - Guess me specialty. - Oral hygiene. - I can't kill Rory. So you're gonna have to pay. - Well, with respect, mate, I've already been flung off a cliff and made to run through the middle of Malta in my bastard pants. So, I, I, I kind of think I've, I've paid enough. - I missed the birth of me son. I should have been there. Instead I'm friggin' over here chasing stupids. This should help. - Course, you should have swabbed it with alcohol. I might get an infection. - What is it? - Sodium amytal or some other truth drug. - Makes you tell the truth? - Yep. - Does it work? - Yep. Ask me somethin' I'd lie about. - Are we gonna die? - Yep. - Fuck it works, then, don't it? - He's gonna torture us to death. Or slit our throats. Or bury us alive. - Oh, Jesus Christ. Leave it off, fuckin' hell. - Were you gonna leave me? - Can't ask me that, I won't answer. - No, no, now come on. Were you gonna leave me? - Yes. - Why'd you come back? - You're my son. I couldn't leave you. - No, no, you're a fucking... You're a scumbag, mate. - Yeah, I'm a lying scumbag. - I'm not a psychopath. But you might think I am by the time I'm finished. - I know something you don't know. I know something you don't know. - Dad, what are you doing? - We're gonna get outta here. You know those ropes. I loosened them. - Get him, Dad! Dad, get him! Choke, come on, Dad, go on Dad... - Ow! - I'm gonna kill your son and make you fucking watch. - Oi! - Don't, no, no, no, no, no... Just let her go. - I could never hit a woman, but I can shoot one. - Get him Dad! Go on, get him! No, just let him go, please! Please! You could come with. - Trust me. - Why don't you curse? - Leave him, just leave him alone. - 'Cause he was a good person. - You're a fucking idiot who never figured out that all these flashy moves are better on a chorus line. This is the job. - Leave him, just leave him alone... - Oh, for fuck's sake. It's over. - You okay? - Yeah, you? - Just gimme a minute. Come on, come on, let's go. - Oh, shit. - Wait there. - All I wanna know is where the bearer bonds are. Huh? And then we can go home. Ah, give it up for the fuckin' agent girl. The tenacity on you, wow. You know what you need to do is come work for me. - You'd love that, wouldn't you? - I would love that, yeah. - Yeah. - Now, none of your tricks, you hear me? - What are you gonna do, Rory? - Bearer bonds, where are they? - They're lost to you now, they're with the government. - Well then, I guess it ends here now, doesn't it? - Yeah, guess so. ♪ This one goes out to all of us ♪ ♪ Especially those of us who are wrestling ♪ ♪ With doubts and fears and maybe have ♪ ♪ Lost sight of the passion of who we really are ♪ ♪ Life is not about what we can't or should do ♪ ♪ It's about what we can and could do ♪ ♪ You know what I mean ♪ ♪ Don't let the negativity and cynicism in the world ♪ ♪ Dampen your precious spirit ♪ ♪ Because your candle could be the spark ♪ ♪ That lights up the world ♪ - Well, it was minimal.
