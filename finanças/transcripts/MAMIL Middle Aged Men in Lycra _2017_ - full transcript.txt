Just gotten up to go for a training ride. Want to knock over a hundred Ks this morning. I'm a bit pissed off, 'cause Kate's had a go at me for waking up so early and waking her up. That's the pot calling the kettle black. She wakes up at 4:50 at least two days a week to go to the gym and here I wake up at 5:10 and she's cracking the shits. Saying I can ride all day, on a Sunday. I can't do that, I've got the kids. So I've gotta bloody look after the garden 'cause we're trying to sell our house, too. Then I've got the dog scratching at the window 'cause it wants to go for a walk, but bike riding comes before walking the dog, that's for sure. Had my first race and that was it. Bang, gone, done, I'm on. Where can I get my next advantage from? Can I buy some carbon wheels? Should I lose five kilos so I can go up hills faster? Everything had to be carbon, you know. Looking at micrograms and taking off your valve stems to you know, save the weight. I've shaved my legs since I started cycling because I've got chunky legs and it actually makes you look slightly leaner. They're not out hunting, are they? They're not doing that sort of primaeval thing anymore. This is a way of being a man. They're trying to get their career going and they're trying to get their family going. Then they all of a sudden look down and they've got a belly. Definitely middle aged. And proud of it. If you're on the cusp of turning 40, you could be in for a rather bumpy ride. There are ways to battle through your midlife crisis and the answer might be a combination of Lycra and a chamois hammock. These middle aged men, in their funny little shoes tippy-toeing around cafes in Brighton and South Yarra. MAMILs, Middle Aged Men In Lycra. That's right. Did you say mammals? Mammal? Human, whale or... MAMIL? MAMIL tends to be used derogatively. Road cyclists with all the gear and no idea. You couldn't have missed the growth in Middle Aged Men In Lycra. The phrase that it's the new golf always frustrates me. Nobody takes skin off on a golf course. I feel fantastic, I feel fit, I feel nimble. 54 years old, but I love nothing better than, than chasing after a 25 year-old. I feel like I'm flying. There's nothing better than with a group of friends riding along country lanes at speed. I'm not going to deny it. That I am absolutely a MAMIL and I am a happy MAMIL. Traditionally, bike riding was a very working class sport. It's certainly changed. Cycling has changed. And no one has embraced the sport more so than middle aged men. In 2010 this phenomenon was given a name. The research that we do involves talking to a lot of manufacturers. There was this phenomenon that they were seeing strong growth in sales of bikes to middle aged men. There was this term doing the rounds: Middle Aged Men In Lycra. We thought that was a great acronym to use, MAMIL. A MAMIL is a middle aged man in what fabric? Lycra. Yes. The MAMIL has become part of popular culture and in 2014 MAMIL was officially added to the Oxford English Dictionary. The MAMIL has even taken to the stage. MAMIL is a redemption play. It's about a guy who's a property developer, who's not a very nice man who joins a peloton, discovers Lycra and the freedom and the joy of Lycra and the joy of actually having a group of men that can actually solve his problems. Ah yeah, good day. My name is Brian Cook. I'm a property developer. I'm married, I've got two kids and a chihuahua. You don't have to wear Lycra, do you? You wouldn't get me in Lycra if you gave me a million pounds. No one looks good in Lycra. No. I think it's pretty scary, actually. Lycra's just so over the top. It's like, yeah, I wear Lycra. Lycra. - It's like if you put me in a pair of Speedos, it would not look at very nice. It makes you pour your body into something which is going to show every lump and bump. And it's like learning to go to a nudist beach and not worry about it. It's just embarrassing in public. Look and see everything. There's a hotel restaurant in New Zealand which has taken the step of banning Lycra cycling shorts. They're wearing, essentially, their underwear. Perhaps they should wear a cod piece. You want just baggy shorts over whatever makes them comfortable holding their junk in. One great thing about Lycra. You get to show off your wonderful legs, so... Looks a bit of a wank when you first start riding, but it does make sense, actually. I had like a German flag, but I thought it's a little bit too much. But I think I should show where I'm from. After being formerly 345 any time I put on Lycra, it's a win for me. I may look a little bit chubby in Lycra. I don't care. I'm out actually doing something about my body, my mind and my health. Cycling is an expensive sport. Somebody might spend two or 300 pounds on getting a bike as a student, but the MAMIL will spend two, 3,000 pounds and upwards. Something that has caught the attention of manufacturers. InterBike, one of the world's largest cycling expos, is in full swing. More than 700 companies are here to show off their latest products. Cycling is a very big business in America. Our industry is doing close to $6 billion in total revenues. We do have an older demographic for the higher end bikes. Much like people want a high performance race car when they get in their 60s they can afford it. The same goes for the high end road bikes as well. You know, it's fun. Everybody wants the best stuff, right? You know, you want a Ferrari. You can never afford it, if you can, you get it. I think it's the panache of it, if you like. Sort of the bragging rights to say to your friends hey, my bike cost 10,000, 12,000 dollars. Colnagos are rare enough on a group ride. Whenever someone shows up with one they all crowd and just like ogle the thing for a while. The pro guys, they're not paying for their product, right? They're getting their product for free. It's the amateur racers that are purchasing our product. We're definitely a very white, middle aged industry. It's what we have., it's what we are. Middle Aged Men In Lycra. I'm one of them. We'd have 30 riders here easy. We're the Fat Boys cycling group. 20 years old. We are about to go for a Saturday morning ride up into the hills. Fat Boys started with a small group of fathers from the local primary schools. We don't take ourselves too seriously. It's middle aged men trying to keep themselves in some sort of shape. But also there's a lot of support. Not just having good fun but we all go through interesting times in our lives and that's an important part of that support network that you get from a bunch of guys that look after each other. Got all these guys all over the road. Yeah, beautiful formation. I've lost 12 kilos, mate. 12 now? Yeah. Jeez, you must have been fat before. Oh, you've done well, mate. In the Fat Boys we've been going so long, the actual average has crept up. So it would be now 53 or 54 years old, which is kind of on the top end of being a Middle Aged Man In Lycra, I guess. I'd say that the culture has dictated pretty much the bloke that ends up being a Fat Boy. Morning. Typical Adelaide Fat Boy would be a professional. Now I don't know why that is. I suspect that is because those of us who have started fitted that democratic and therefore we invited our mates. Go on mate, let's go now. There is no hard and fast mission statement, except that we are recreational. It's the weekend warriors that we cater for and it's been pretty successful. You know in a way I'm kind of proud. I think I'll be remembered more for being the President of the Fat Boys than I will for my family. As much as though I love, they're my priority, that's the reality. My philosophy's always been when you're descending, go fast enough to kill yourself because what a shame to just get hurt. I think the law kind of found me more than I went looking for it. Okay, it's really Order 60-60 as with the enforcement. There's days that I just hate it, I just despise it. But then there's other days when it's just kind of shh! Don't tell anybody that this, you know. They'll all want to do it. If you're busy as a barrister and when you're trying to get established you crave work. I'd really fallen for this whole Superman complex hook, line and sinker. You know, I could go to work, I was good at what I did, I got reinforcement there and I was just so detached from, you know, my family. And you know I wasn't doing too well, really I suppose as a consequence of you know, the relationship breakdown and you know, I think my head space was really pretty fucked up. Well a turning point for me was my cousin who said, I've got this old bike, interested in borrowing it? That's how I got started. I think it was just really all about trying to come to terms with myself, really. It's given me fitness, it's given me new friendships. I met Ann, she has a common interest in cycling, so that's been terrific. I don't quite know why we like riding with each other because, because sometimes, because I'm a lot slower than Doug. I like to ride at a certain pace, whereas he likes to push himself. It's winter here. It's cold. But the sun was out this morning. I thought, oh yeah. Tap out a few Ks. 20 Ks down the road, hail. You can hear it banging on your helmet. Great. Good experience. Doug has signed up for the ultimate MAMIL holiday: a 10 day cycling tour through the mountains of Spain and France. He will ride some stages of one of the world's toughest and most gruelling races: La Vuelta a Espana. Bravo. I'm actually genuinely concerned about this trip. Probably the biggest physical challenge I think I've probably ever had to deal with in my life. One of Doug's greatest challenges will be climbing the legendary Col Du Tourmalet. His body will be pushed to its limits. I'm still getting a little bit of pain, more actually post-ride. Now it was your plan that we'd inject it today? Well, it's up to you, but if we can do that today, that suits me to do it today. That's fine. I don't know whether it's daunting or whether it's sort of funny really, but a 53 year old bloke who wants to go and ride up and down big hills and you know maybe age is catching up on me. This might be my last chance, who knows. Just going to finalise the packing and then be heading slowly towards the airport and Spain. I'm recording, yeah. There's the key to the letterbox. Okay. Are you excited? I am excited. Going to miss you. You have to tell me how you're feeling. I'm going to miss you, Doug. I'm going to miss you too, Ann. I'll see you when I get back. Be safe. See ya. Meanwhile, in Manhattan cycling plays a role in another relationship. We were both on a dating site on the internet. And I put my profile up and he hit on me almost immediately because in my profile I said I baked bread and he said he was very impressed by that. I said, if you bake bread, we need to talk. He had cycling pictures on his profile. He warned me he would be wearing an atrociously loud bicycling jersey and I'd be able to pick It was very loud, yes. him out. This is a LeMond Maillot Jaune. It's kind of a gold lame colour. I bought it for Jim so that he would have access to a bicycle. He wanted me to catch the bug so he bought a bike, and it was really sweet. But no, I didn't catch the bug. He is deaf to the seraphim calls of the bicycle. Mm-hmm. There's two things he loves in life. Me and his bicycle. When I leave the apartment and I get on the bicycle, I immediately feel relaxed. I think human beings like to be outdoors. They like to have green things around them and they like to have the sun on their faces and have the open road before them. Bikers up. Thank you. I've always thought men in Lycra looked good no matter what age they were and it's shocking to me that there aren't more gay guys involved in cycling just because of the clothing. It's shocking, just shocking. It was 1994 and the Gay Games were coming to New York City. We were going to have bicycling events. We didn't have any cycling groups, so, you know, I started a cycling group. Hey! Nice to see you. Happy Pride. Happy Pride. Oh, Robert's here. Do you smell? A little. I just cycled 33 miles. Growing up older in the gay community is unique. Because it is a very youth oriented culture, many people felt left out as they aged. It's not so much about needing a gay specific club because you're not going to be accepted elsewhere. If you want to find other people who like you that's where it comes in. Ye-haw. It's become more of a social club really, for me because that's the people who I hang out with. It's a great little group. Being middle aged and single for me it's an opportunity to stay connected to like-minded folks. I don't go to bars anymore. Bars are kind of already passe. And I certainly don't play on Grindr. You know, I originally thought it was going to be like a competitive thing and we originally called ourselves Fast 'n Fabulous Cycling Team. That got tired pretty quickly. At one point I thought, oh yes, we're the gay club, the gay bike club in New York City. And now there's a dozen gay bike clubs in New York City, so whatever. We're here, we're queer, get used to it. I like to ride my bike. A lot. So it's not a big surprise that my spiritual journey is not really a walk with Jesus, but more of a ride. It can be blindingly fast, joyfully exhilarating and simultaneously balanced and out of control. In a way, it's sort of like my form of worship. I'm not a very good singer. I don't feel like I'm glorifying God when I sing. But I do feel like I can do that when I'm on a bike. In 2007, Tim started a Christian cycling group in Minneapolis. Welcome everybody. We start every ride with a prayer. Six days you shall labour and do all your work, but the seventh day is the Sabbath to the Lord, your God. You shall not do any work. Exodus 20:10. All right. We've had Jewish people, atheists, agnostics, a Wiccan, all join us on rides. Here we go! I love the community that it provides. We feel part of something. Oh, they were taking off. They just weren't leaving you. I told you you could do this ride. Part of what we're trying to do is bring our faith into absolutely everything that we do. Here we go. Praying and inviting God to come with us on the ride is just something that seems like an extension of that. No, it's okay. I'm here for the fellowship, not the speed. I also like solo rides where I'm just alone with my thoughts and my prayers. I really enjoy that quiet time. It helps ground me. I love the speed. I'm not gonna lie, I wish I was faster, but everybody does. It can get 20 below very easily here. I have a hard and fast rule not to ride if it's below 10 below. Studs front and back. Pretty aggressive tread to go with the studs. I wear a snowboarding helmet and snowboarding goggles. I'm in the middle of Venture Harcourt Challenge trying to raise some money by riding in this weather for a good charity. Yeah, keep going. To me cycling embodies a lot of what Christ was talking about with being in community with one another and we kind of check each other and make sure that we're being the best men and husband and father that we can be. So today's ride obviously I'm leading it, so it's a social ride. These guys are always teasing me because, because they say I only want to do the social rides. I don't want to do all the hard hustles claiming the hills, but it's true. Car up, car up! A lot of our rides, they're party rides. We have made up music trailers. And as we're going down people are looking at us and they start clapping, they're taking pictures. So it looks like everyone's having a good time back there. We welcome everybody. We're not looking down at you because you have a $50 bike or we're not looking up at you 'cause you have a 10,000 dollar bike. This is about sharing an experience in the streets of Los Angeles. There's not many Latino or Hispanic cycling clubs in Los Angeles even though Hispanics make up a large portion of Los Angeles. When I started the Eastside Bike Club, definitely it was started to help me. My weight was nearly 400 pounds and the doctor told me that he's done everything that he can to save my life, and he knew I had a lot of friends. A lot of those friends will be at my funeral. So I just thought that it wasn't time for me to die yet. I contacted a couple of friends. Told them, I need your help, I need your support to start bike riding. Could you guys join me? All of a sudden the group grew to 20 people, 30 people, 50 people. People started coming to support the cause, to support me. Shortly after I realised that it wasn't just for me. We were helping a lot of people. In Los Angeles we have alarming cases of diabetes and obesity. And cycling has been a fun way to help fight it. We call the streets of Los Angeles our gym. We've created a change in our community by changing a lifestyle. Being morbid obese you don't see what you're missing until you're able to do it again. It's Thursday night and that means it's football night. We're going to Beacon Hill, which is Harry's local team. Here he is, this is Harry. Hello. Harry plays in the Under 12 Flames. I'm one of the coaches and we're doing that for about an hour and a half or so. That's another reason why I can't get out on my bike on Thursday nights. There was a point in my life where I felt I needed to do something about my fitness levels, about my weight and also that I needed to start doing stuff for myself. For ten years, I'd been living predominantly for other people. For my wife, for my kids, you know, establishing our family unit. And there was a home video of me. I'm wearing this top and I was shocked, actually, at how I looked. And I thought, God, that's quite sad. If I carry on this path, it's gonna get worse and worse and worse and do I really want to be this sort of massive bloated bloke who can't even kick a football around with his son because I've let myself go so badly? It was purely by chance my employer at the time had a bike to work scheme and I thought, okay, well I'll get a bike. What I love about cycling is the freedom it gives you. You're on your own, you're on the road, you can go anywhere you want for as long as you like. Time to think. Time to contemplate stuff. Figure things out in your head. There's really no feeling like it. Rupert rides only on his own, under his own speed. He doesn't want to be directed or influenced by anybody else. I'd like him to ride with other people because I think safety, which is something that worries me terribly about him going out. It's not helped by all those videos that are uploaded all the time of all these incidents that happen. And it's like everything's amplified now in terms of the danger. But that doesn't mean it couldn't happen. No, of course not, but then I could walk down the road and something could happen and you know you can't... But it's more likely. I don't know. On a country lane on your own. I'm not sure, I'm not sure it is. I'm not sure it is. ♪ Your ass ♪ ♪ I'm on a motherfucking bike ♪ ♪ I'm on a motherfucking bike ♪ ♪ Sharing my aggression what I do ♪ ♪ Everyday I'm riding Tour De Fuck You ♪ ♪ Banging on hoods and kicking in fenders ♪ ♪ A right-of-way-aholic on a permanent bender ♪ ♪ Running red lights at the fat intersection ♪ ♪ Cutout seats protects my erection ♪ Three times I've been attacked. I was knocked down deliberately by a taxi driver. Fuck! In England, it's his word against you, if you have no evidence. Fuck you! On various occasions I've been assaulted, knocked off my bike, abused. You fucking cunt, I'll do you. Fucking scraped my fucking van. You fucking idiot. I turned the tables against the idiots and the shit heads on the road. I utilise all the latest technology, GoPro cameras and I'll bring them in front of the judges and the police and then I'll report it to their boss so they end up sacked. As an extra safety device, I've got two truck horns fitted up to a 12 volt battery so it goes like this. Now that's 150 decibels. If they don't see ya, they can definitely hear ya. I reported about 110 people in one month. Why are you on your mobile phone, sir? You should not have it in your hand. It's against the law. If you violate the traffic rules, I will either give you the red card or I'll send evidence to the police, bust you and prosecute you. Red card. Fuck's sake! Read the fucking signs! I'm merely reporting what I see on the roads. I'm not going looking for it, but I seem to find a lot of it and the police are quite happily using my video evidence to prosecute the drivers and I think that's a good thing. Adelaide Fat Boy, Jim Turner is well aware of the dangers on the roads. We try and police each other. There's a potential for having a good little accident when everyone's riding closely together. In the Fat Boys we're very conscious of our impact on the motorists. Car back! Car back.- Car back alerts the group that a car's about to pass them. Fuck, there's some bloody bikes coming. He's gonna take em out. Shit, he's still going. Fucking hell. That guy was an idiot. Yeah. We notice badly behaved cars who deliberately try to scare you and for those drivers out there who do that, it works. It does scare us. Look, there have been a lot of accidents. Usual injury is a collarbone because they come on their shoulder, it snaps off. But there are a lot of others too. The guys fall off and lose a bit of bark. But, you know, invariably they're back on the bike within a month or so. I think it would be fair to say that all the wives of people that have had big accidents, I think you'd find most of those wives would be happy if they never saw another bike again. I bought a new bike, a mountain bike. I've been riding a road bike for 21 years and decided to give mountain biking a crack. And 11 kilometres into my first training ride, Ow. I fell off my bike. Technically I've broken my back. Midair I thought, no, this can't be right. You know, I can't believe it. Crushed my L3 vertebrae. This is pretty bad. This is serious stuff. And all the wives, partners get really cross that they can put themselves in that sort of danger, but what can you do? When I'm riding in Manhattan what I say to myself is every 15 feet there'll be something that you didn't expect. There's a pedestrian who pops out from between two cars. There's a pothole. Or doors. There's a car pulling out from a parking place. It's like a very bad video game. - That's the way I view that. - It's like a video game. And before you know it, you're dead. You're not dead. Most people we know have had an accident on a bike and it's been quite serious. It's not most. We know of people who have... - A lot of people. - Who've had unfortunate incidents. Came off my bike and broke six ribs and four fingers. Mine was my riding partner cut across me and brought me down when we were trying to have a sprint to the finish. 'Cause I got a brain bleed and that was from a bike fall also. I've had broken femurs and backs and collarbones and shoulders. Not much, ankles, not much I haven't broken. I broke my collarbone and fractured two ribs and a bit of a collapsed lung. And Jim was behind me and he went down as well and got concussion. Knocked myself out, completely wrote my bike off, took out my whole shoulder blade and you know, it's a dangerous sport. On the outskirts of Melbourne veteran cyclist Thommo isn't letting his latest accident keep him off the bike. I've had a heap of bike accidents over my time starting off when I was about 16. Got run over by a car. I had a fall in a bike race when I was about 35 and broke the socket of my hip in three spots. I got run over by a car about 4 years ago. Broke my leg right through here. Had it set in a frame like that for three months. His big scar down the front. So he had tubes coming out of that. But you've been hit on that freeway twice. You got hit by that prime mover. Oh, that's another time. Yes. I got run over by a truck riding to work one day and he just didn't see me and... You were lucky. The mirror flicked him out into the grass and didn't take him under the truck. So someone definitely is looking after you. Lowest moment over the last 19 weeks has really been when I went to the specialist expecting there to be some healing and he basically told me that the injuries were exactly the same as two seconds after I hit the road. They actually hadn't healed at all. I've decided from how my neck feels and from a lot of previous accidents, it's time to do something and the time for sitting around like on your bum is over whether the doctors like it or not. A couple of times very close to to being it and it's very hard to kind of come back and watch him get back on the bike. Ultimately, I'd rather him be happy and on the bike than sitting on the couch, you know, an unhappy man. Are you sure you don't want me to follow you in the car again, Dad? - Yeah, I'm sure, Sarah. - Okay. I'll be all right this time. - All right. - Thanks a lot. Be safe, good luck. - Bye bye. - Bye. Bye, dear. I'm staying down the back or right up the front so that when they do fall off 'cause most of the time somebody does because they're not watching what they're doing, I'm well out of the road. The novice riders are people that are taking up riding as a midlife crisis type thing. And they seem to be fairly normal people till they get on a bike and then they seem to turn into complete idiots, forget all the road rules. So those rides are scary. You think something's going to happen and it usually does. I think if I fell on my neck with a neck brace on, hopefully my neck's strong enough to take the fall and I'd be okay. Falling off does not worry me in the absolute slightest. I rode before I met Vern. Sometimes he thinks he taught me how to ride a bike, but that's not true. We'd only been married probably 3 years, I think, when he had his accident. I'm on a downhill and going pretty fast. Then I got a flat and I wobbled there. So as I'm braking and getting over, my front wheel dropped down in the ground and then flipped me over. Instantly, it's like flipping a light switch. First I work and then I don't work. Vern's accident was hard. I think what helped was that he was so positive from the moment he woke up. While I was in the hospital they gave me a Sports &amp; Spokes magazine and it showed hand-cycling. And I said, wow, yes I can. Vicky and I hopped in the car and went to an Abilities Expo. Tried out three different handcycles. Decided which one I wanted to get and ordered it right then. And it's been full speed ahead since then. I can ride 4,000 miles a year. Sometimes I fall just a pinch short. I've been as high as 5,000 miles in a year. So it's a lot of time in the saddle. This is a Lightning. It's got a pivot underneath so that's how you steer it is by leaning. And this is a top end XLT Pro. I had them do the little fancier wheels, the carbon wheels. I've had this one at 39 and 1/2 miles an hour. Okay, we can go a little faster now, Dale. Okay. Keep going, keep going. I got all kinds of gears left. Vern thinks he can do anything and everything and I'm like, wait a minute. You can't. Well. One time I rode over towards Ankeny on a weekend and a little later, a little later, a little later she called me. Where are you? Well, I'm in Slater, Iowa. Well that's 86 miles round trip. Or I might go the other way down into Des Moines of a night. Do it by myself. Maybe that's a little stupid or maybe that's a little brave, but normally I don't have a problem with doing that. I'm going by and I got a problem, I'll ask somebody. We've had to give a lot of things up that we love to do. But cycling wasn't one of 'em. The tandem's good because we can stay together and I don't have to worry about him. Running a left or right? I think left. - Left? - Yep. Stopping. I like riding a tandem because it lets us get caught up on what's going on during the day a little better. What I like about riding this tandem I'm in control. Yeah. That's a good thing. Yeah. For you. For me. Vern still thinks he's in charge even though I shift, I steer, I brake. I'm in charge. I'm in total control of the bike. And Vern's still yelling directions at me. - Yeah. - I go, really, Vern? We take that tandem quite a few places. Last year we took it to Arizona with us and rode for a couple of weeks and it's a work in itself to get things ready to take, I'd say, you know, okay, a challenged person to take them on a road trip. And quite frankly, we more adventurous than most of the people that we know that ride bikes because we're the ones that are going on trips and going somewhere else. I just love it. Australian barrister Doug Shirrefs has arrived in Spain ready to begin his cycling tour. Welcome to Spain, everyone. - Yes. - Yeah. Eating the food and drink of the region is a big part of the MAMIL holiday. More importantly they need to fuel up for tomorrow's ride. Doug's holiday is all about experiencing La Vuelta. Spain's most famous bike race. Today's stage is a 156 kilometre road race. Doug will ride the course ahead of the professional riders. He's starting early, before the roads are closed. See how we go on the flat. Could be a lot of fun today, but it could also be very, very hot. Even with a head start, it'll be a huge challenge to stay ahead of the pack. Well give it a good crack and see if we can stay in front of the Peloton all day. We should get a two and a half, three hour start on them. With a bit of luck, we'll beat them to the coast. Tour operator, David Olle has been running cycling holidays in Europe since the late 1990s. If we were to aim at somebody it would be a male, 50s. Wouldn't have been cycling 10 years. We were right? I've had people come along who just want to ride 20K and then jump in the car with me and ride along. I've had people who want to do 160 K and see the race pass and have a bit of time in the afternoon having a drink and watching a bit of the race. The Middle Aged Men In Lycra, they're going to be around for a long time, I think. Come on, Dougie! Thanks, is it powder, just water? No, that's alright, that's great. Yes, Dad. The temperature is now a blistering 41 degrees Celsius. That's 105 degrees Fahrenheit. Whoa, whoa, whoa. We can rehydrate them, get some food into them. Ah! Here comes the caravan. The publicity caravan has been a part of Europe's grand cycling tour since the 1930s. The convoy travels ahead of the race handing out freebies from sponsors earning its nickname, the caravan of crap. Well that's the caravan. That's why people come out here just to look at that, don't they? Now I'm convinced there's a race coming. I don't think we'd beat the race. Oh, we're a chance, maybe. No, you're a chance 'cause you've nearly done all the climbing. If he says we're a chancing... 83 to go. We'll give it a go. Doug's time has run out. Just short of the finish line in Penascola, he's ordered off the course to make way for the Peloton. I reckon I was a chance, mate. Think I would have made it. Yeah. One of the great things we know about anything to do with tourism, leisure and sport is a tremendous capacity to reinvent itself to create things to do. You see endless stories now, people in the local press oh, I'm doing this kind of charity ride. We were going from maybe having a couple of hundred people turning up to 2,000 people to some of these events. Welcome to the 2016 Maca Ride to Conquer Cancer. We'll be getting underway in just about... Back in Australia nearly a thousand cyclists are giving up their weekend for a charity ride. One of the groups supporting the cause is team MAMIL. Hey, Chet, how you doing? Our story is a story of two mates. Me and my best friend, Franko. - He's the man. - He's my man. - No he's the man. - He da man. We da men. He's the man. We'd known each other since the age of 14. And over a period of, you know, 15 years we both ended up over in Western Australia. Every year, Franko would have a Boxing Day party at his house. And one particular year, 5 years ago, Franko was quite withdrawn and not really celebrating and we couldn't quite figure out like what's going on here? He's not very bubbly. And the scenario was that he'd discovered only a week before that he had throat cancer. When we thought everything was going to be better, he actually got worse. So that was a bit of a challenge then, wasn't it? - Yeah, it was hard. - That was a year later. I was feeling very helpless. I just didn't know what to do or you know, how I could help him in any way, shape or form. And I was sitting back one night at home and a Ride To Conquer Cancer ad came on telly and I thought, well if I can do anything I'm going to get on my bike and I'm going to raise 2 1/2 thousand bucks for my best mate. I went on the first ever Ride To Conquer Cancer. I rode by myself, I had nobody else around me. Finished that ride and Franko was standing there at the finish line. He was not a well man at the time. He'd been through chemotherapy, he'd been through radiation. You know, we hugged and we cried and everything else and then he sort of disappeared. And what he'd done was he'd turned around and walked off and went over to the registration desk and he signed himself and myself up for the following year. At that time I didn't know whether I was going to be cured or not. No matter what happened, he's not going to ride alone again. I won't let that happen. From that moment, Team MAMILs was born and before we knew it we had 16 people on the road all decked out in MAMILs kits. Away we went, it was amazing. One, two, three, MAMILs! Franko has been cancer free for 4 years and Team MAMIL has become a regular fixture on the Ride To Conquer Cancer. Ready, set, ride! It's the MAMILs! And off they go. Take care out there. Today, Craig and Franko will be riding 100 kilometres south to the town of Mandurah. We've never claimed to be fit. We don't speed down the track. We just sit on 25 Ks an hour and have a good time. Everybody awake now? Come on, pedal! Good day to be a MAMIL. Every person that's got a kit on has raised 2 1/2 thousand dollars each to do the ride. So the Team MAMILs, over the last 5 years we've raised about $200 thousand for this event. Everybody within the team has been touched by cancer in one way, shape or form. It just silently creeps onto your world, the older you get. Being a middle aged man as you grow older, the more it affects you. Are you ready? I'm ready, I'm now ready. Oh, look at that stance, James. About 10 years ago I had a series of symptoms. Numbness and falling over. And being a bloke I didn't go to the doctor. Didn't do anything about it at all. And then I woke up one day and I couldn't see through my right eye. Very quickly it became evident something was badly wrong and I was diagnosed with MS. I was absolutely convinced that I was not going to be able to have children and as for sport, forget it. You know, I was just counting down the days to the wheelchair. And I thought, well I've got MS, woe is me. And then I realised that I needed to do something about it. When I ride my bike, I don't have balance issues, so I bought a road bike. And very, very quickly I was massively into it. Julia, 7:30 rolling, yeah? As Richard began riding with some mates in his local area his enthusiasm caught on and a cycling club was born. It was a really positive reaction. And then we started talking about that real male thing of ooh, what would the kit look like? I really like what Eddie Merckx used to wear. You know, we want something classic. And you start riffing about it and you're just playing at first and you're saying, yeah, the kit will be that. Then someone mocks up a kit. And you know we can actually do this. We look bloody stupid and know we look bloody stupid and we're just weekend warriors trying to set our own best times and challenging each other the same way you do when you're at school. And as a bloke that is, it is spiritual. It is a spiritual need. The thing with MS is it robs you of fundamental things like seeing properly. You have to come to terms with the fact that you're never going to see that well again. You know and they say, oh, you might get better, but you know what? You don't, not completely. My symptoms have always been down the right side of my body. The right leg's kind of sitting there and saying, thanks for the ride. But you know what? I'm still reasonably quick. I don't know, maybe I should go for the Paralympics. Maybe I'm some sort of... Maybe I've got the best left leg in the business. But that is MS. It's been awful in the past. Right now, it's pretty good and I think that's 'cause I ride my bike. There is something going on with maleness in society, about what it means to be a male and also linked to wider issues about maybe health wanting to still be an active person and I think cycling has become a vehicle for that because it's just accessible. You can just go and buy a bike and then go riding. I think when you start to embrace that you get into what might be then the more interesting parts of that culture, the stylization of it. The seduction of the equipment, the need then to be better than you once were and there's always a reason why we can be better than we once were doing a sport, isn't there and the answer usually is we can buy some product. This is what I call shed two. I would have a shed but it had to have things like garden equipment, camping equipment, family stuff in it. So I needed something which was purely for the important stuff, my bikes. This is a day to day workhorse. It's a Bianchi, I love Bianchis. This is my winter bike. Which brings me to the latest bike. It's just a dream. Well I've got 11 bikes in total. Well I've got about 13 bikes. What's the rule of bikes? - It's always... - And one more. Whatever you have plus one. Bike's worth, probably about $300 thousand or up. Six and a half to seven, maybe. Just placed an order for a 9,000 Euro bike. If I don't buy something every other week, then that is an odd week. Winter clothes, gloves, lights. I thought I'd treat myself to new wheels, just, you know. Lots of jerseys and you start stacking those up, I probably got $7,000 in jerseys. In terms of what you can spend, you can easily, you can lie. My wife doesn't know about the extra thousand for the wheel set I upgraded to. You just don't tell them. I just have it delivered to work so they don't know. 'Cause you told me that you got that bike in a good deal and it wasn't top of the range, but the guy in the shop said it was. And then he followed that up by saying yeah, most of the wives that come in here haven't been told how much their husband's bikes were. I do have guys pay some in cash and some on a card, you know, so that they can tell their wives it was only the amount that was on the card. Occasionally I'll go through the bank statement or whatever and say you know, add it up. And I get very defensive. I'm asking him where this money's coming from and he would say to me, it's just on loan. And there's no money involved. You know what, it's hard to imagine something in life that is more expensive than a really good carbon bike. But you, my love, are it. When you go back in history and you try and say to people what was leisure, they try to define it. And I think if you were to say what's a MAMIL? I think it's that there isn't one identikit, but it's the things they will all do. So they will acquire this, they will be there. They will have the coffee stop. They will tell the stories as if they know Chris Froome, it's Froomey. They don't go to Mont Ventoux. It's oh, I did Ventoux. It's this casual kind of style and approach of almost like personal acquisition of things. So they can buy their ultra-expensive bike. They can spend tonnes of money on their equipment. They can train and they can project this out into the wider public every time they go out. There's a phrase called following in the footsteps of giants. They want to go and do the events based around the races of the pros. And then they want to tell everybody about it. That side of it I'm not so sure about because we've moved almost into cycling becoming a packaged holiday. If I was comparing this to going away with Annie on a holiday, so we were in France and Italy last year and I've intentionally not been taking many photos because there's a lot of things that I'm seeing that I'd really love to experience with her. I got a bit of a cook about that because she loves photos and she'd be happy for me to take photos, so... It's radically different. You know, this is a very self-indulgent thing that we do, but by the same token, you know, she's pretty cool about it. It's the MAMIL experience, isn't it, you know? This is what we live for. Today is La Vuelta's individual time trial and it's a chance for Doug to see the world's greatest cyclists up close. That's a good descent. They'd be picking up big speed. They use the gears so well. Ordinary blokes like me, we don't use the gears that well. We're banging away, you know, a couple of gears at a time. These guys are using every gear perfectly. Here comes another one. Here's this one. Look at this, I mean... They are whizzing by. These guys are fast. They're going off their heads. Smooth. Really smooth. The place has gone mad. The place has just gone... It's gone mad. There he is. The great man. He's on the steak, Contador! Can he do it? That's it, I mean, my life's complete. My life is complete. I have seen Alberto Contador, the maddest bastard in the whole thing. Full gas on a time trial straight. There's an interesting point to be made about the whole social environment of cycling, which MAMILs can fit comfortably into and one is that it's intrinsically white. The other thing, there's a part of it is being intrinsically male. 90, 95% men, I don't really know why, but it is. I guess the testosterone, isn't it? We're more competitive. Blokes, going as fast as they can. It's not that welcoming to women, is it? Because they are intimidating. They push you off the road. There's just like a surge of testosterone and corporate middle aged money ride past you. It's a bit like our careers, really. We've always been the minority in our careers as well. Apparently maybe I could be a middle aged madam in Lycra. I don't like the idea of being a madam. MAFILs. We are MAFILs, aren't we? Yeah. - But I actually quite like the middle aged MILF in Lycra. I can't think of any men in our club who wouldn't want women on the ride. But it's about getting women to the start of the ride. What advice are you going to give me this time, hmm? What does happen in bunches sometimes is that men will mansplain things to you. Now when a Warrugal riders get up the road, the other Warrugal riders don't chase. - Don't chase. Do you understand that? I know that. Middle aged women I think will worry about what they're going to look like in Lycra. Because you're bent over, whether your bum's going to look big. So they're very worried about how they're going to appear. And they are worried that they won't be fast enough. Being the sole female I really didn't want them to think oh, you know, we're waiting for Karen. So in the back of my mind was always don't be last. Men are competitive. I know when I pass one of the guys I can hear them grunt as I go past and I think, yes I've passed them and I know that they're gotta to try and keep up with me and try and pass me further down the road. No one wants to be chicked, although it happens quite often. More often than we care to admit to. This harks back to the work that we do with boys in early childhood. If a girl beats them then they have to go and show that that is just some sort of aberration and they have to actually go and beat them because in their mind a man shouldn't be beaten by a girl. For a given person, they're going to have their reasons for riding. And I think some people need to win and they want to ride and they want to race. I think some people are born to race. I always get really nervous at races like this far more so than say the divisional championships at the weekend where I wasn't worried at all at the start. After a long day at the office 42 year old father of two, Andy Critchlow is preparing for a local Masters race. Bit of an arms race as well, bike-wise here, you'll notice tonight. You could fund a small country off the back of the amount of gear that you've got here. But these guys take it deadly seriously. We're coming here to try and get a result. We'll see. Ten laps as normal. This is a working airfield. You need to keep to your own side of the road. There is a Top Gear bus going round tonight so there will be more cars on the circuit than normal. Best of luck. Make sure you keep an eye out for each other and have a safe race. What tends to happen here, you get a lot of attacks. People trying to break it up early on the race. And the people tend to attack early on because at the end of the day we're all old and it takes us a little bit longer to warm up. I got back into the sport about two years ago, made a comeback after almost 17 years out of competitive racing. As a young lad I'd raced for Great Britain. I'd been one of the top 18 year old riders in the country. I set some national records, won national medals and you know one day I can't really explain why I just chucked my bike in a hedge and walked away from it and joined the army. I didn't think I was good enough, in all honesty. You know I saw the guys who were making it at that time and I thought, well I'm never going to be that good. I'd kind of taken the view when I hung up my bike that that was in the past that I'd done this and, you know, I had nothing left to prove with it. In actual fact I did, I had a lot left to prove. I gave it up much too young. I hadn't done with the sport at all. Cycling's a bit like a caveman must have felt when he was like hunting deer. The finish line is like the quarry at the end of it and you haven't eaten for three weeks and you're starving and if you don't get across that line first, then you know it's not just you that's going to starve, it's your whole family, so there's a lot on this. Come on, come on. You're racing to catch up with this deer that's running away from you. How do you replace that? How do you replace that feeling of the chase? You know I want to prove that someone in their early 40s you know can realistically compete at the highest level again. Ooh, no. Andy finishes in the pack after helping his teammate to a third place. But his actions on the track have upset a fellow competitor. I told you what I think. When I get angry, when I want to win I can push pretty hard. It's win or lose, it's all or nothing. And you have to put in that really extreme effort to you know, to win. You devote your whole life to the sport and you've got to if you want to be any good at it. See ya, mate, cheers. Which is tough for me and it's also tough for my family because you know they've got to make concessions as well for me to do this. I think it's brought us together more as a family. It kind of gives you a collective goal in a way. I'm not sure I'd call it a collective goal. Maybe not. You did talk to me about it and said you know I realise that this is going to take up a lot of time. But I wouldn't say it was a family decision that we... No. Just back from today's ride this morning. Now the chaos starts 'cause it's Saturday and the kids have got to go swimming and as you can see, lots of tidying up to do. There you can see my daughter, Ella glued to the iPad. She won't move. You know I love the fact that I've got back on the bike and I love racing and I love beating guys that are half my age, but there's a cost. There's a price that you've got to pay for that. You know I've got 60 hour weeks that I've got to work. Gotta pay the mortgage. You've got a lot of worries, a lot of pressure. You know I don't want anyone to get their violins out because it's my choice, but it's tough, it's very hard. And it's far easier just to sit on your ass and do nothing and just you know, get fat. And just accept that you're middle aged and you know you're gonna get old. And I don't wanna do that, I really don't. Can MAMILs be addicted? I think the answer is they can be addicted to a point where it's unhealthy for them and unhealthy for other people. All that's important to them is themselves and their own sense of place. They can be unnaturally competitive. They can take that competitiveness to extremes. One you could argue is diet and nutrition. Training. Ordinary MAMILs training 20 hours a week. It's what the pro does. So I think some people it's their new obsession. You know it consumes them. Adelaide Fat Boy, Jim Turner has been off the bike for eight weeks after breaking his back in a cycling accident. This is a shot of my back. A CAT scan was taken the day of the accident. You can see from the image that my L3 vertebrae has been crushed. I was flat on my back for four and a half weeks as part of the process of repairing that bone. Fortunately the spinal surgeons have recommended that I didn't need surgery so it's been a process of slow and careful rehabilitations for that bone to repair itself. Jim is expected to make a full recovery. But he's still a few weeks away from rejoining the Fat Boys. There's no way he will stop riding. I mean, I'd rather he didn't. As I said, I can't stop him and I know he'll do it, so. I want my wife to be happy and content. If she doesn't want me to ride my bike um, I'd give it some consideration. This is a bed linen that my wife bought for our wedding anniversary last year. A lovely gift to receive so I can now sleep amongst the bicycles, which is great. I love it when I find a decent bike T-shirt. That's always a good one. I bought him a... What was it, it was made in India? I had to order it online and it was made from aluminium cans. And it's a little bike that sits on his desk. It's so cute. That was a good one. It makes it easier for birthdays. Chocolate, wine and bike things. Tonight I'm going to do my review of the Lumos Helmet, which is a smart helmet I backed on Kickstarter. I'm going right, same again. Well I quite like sharing that with other people. It's got a removable rear mount. It'd be nice to have had an option to mount them on the handlebars themselves. I do have followers. I mean, not a huge amount, but I do get pretty much a couple of comments per video I put up. This is a review of the See Sense Bicycle Lights. Clearly it's something he needs to do. But I worry that I'd rather he was doing something social sometimes. He likes to share. He likes to share what he's discovered, what he's found. He puts those horrendous images. - No, no, no, no, not at all. - Yeah, yeah. There's the selfies when you're really sweaty and disgusting. You might not realise, yeah, that. Yeah, that's helmet hair. It doesn't matter. They're all helmet hair. They're all awful and don't post them. I'm just going to get out for my quick lunchtime ride. He'll go out for a bike ride and he comes back in. He'll say hi and I'll say hi. And then the next thing he'll go into the study and he'll start blogging about it. And I just see his back for hours. But I have streamlined my blogging process now, so. - Yes, yes. I mean, you could do your blog on the train when you're commuting. It's not that easy. Okay. Just a suggestion, you know. In regional Australia Jayman Prestidge is the recently elected President of the local cycling club. As soon as they said, right, you're President, I said righteo. It's my way or the highway. He has big plans. It has been 148 miles an hour and we've done four years of work in 10 months. Doubled the membership. Had all the Velodrome funded and clean. If something needs to be done, it's gotta happen. One of Jayman's crazy ideas as President is we need a new kit. And he says we look like Teletubbies and it's very 1970s or 1990s or something. It's not stylish anymore. But, you know, I think it's a good kit. First of all this orange sliver represents the rolling hills around town. - The blue represents... - The sky! Slightly bigger hills and the sky. Yep, the beautiful blue skies. Or here. So it's a slimming effect on the rear end. You've gotta give him little token victories along the way but we've actively tried to undermine him. Unanimous. I'm also a competitor and being the President actually takes my eye off the ball of my own competitive aspirations in wanting to go out there and ride well. I'm trying to out-psych my competitors by looking totally professional today. The aim is to get a sweat on the brow before I start. What I like about racing against Jayman is he's physically strong, but mentally weak. Turn around and say, gee, you're looking tired. You look a bit sick today. You're not going very well. 300 metres from the line he blows up and I ride past him and beat him. If I don't come across the line for a win today I'll be pissed off. It's as simple as that. Can't let Fat Monk beat me, that's for sure. Welcome all, to the Shady Creek scratch race. We've got four grades going, A, B, C and D. All right, let's go. Away we go, boys. Cycling can affect his mood in a way that if he comes home from a race and he has won, then he's very happy with himself. He'll thrive off that for quite a few weeks and likes to tell everyone what a great cyclist he is. Woo hoo. Oh fuck. When I do the numbers, I think you'll find I might have won. I went shit. If he loses a race he can be very down on himself and I'm not training enough and I should be fitter and if I was doing this I'd be better and... It'd be good if he won a little bit more than he does. You can only try, though. If you let me train more, I'll be able to win more. - No. Yeah, it's as simple as that. You do enough training. The more I train, the more I win. Mm. It is a real fine balancing act. I can see that if you got quite serious about it, it could take over and it could become a problem. Well where to begin. Yes, do. It does quite dominate our lives because it's like training for a marathon or something. You have to put in hours and hours of training. If we didn't have young children then it wouldn't be a problem. In the mornings he's always out, so it's sometimes a bit more difficult 'cause Mum as to manage it all on her own. They sometimes go away to different places, which I don't like. And it's always near my birthday, which is the bad thing. You were asking us to come to all the races, weren't you? But we went to one and stood in the rain for three hours while he went past once every 45 minutes or so. - I don't, it didn't rain. I don't remember it raining. - It did rain. It really rained. I wanted him not to ride on a Sunday morning. Just something trivial, maybe my birthday. Mother's Day. And he would say why are you giving me a hard time for riding my bike? I'd love to spend four hours every Saturday morning going off and doing something that made me feel fantastic, but I don't because I'm at home picking up the pieces. But you won't wear the Lycra. No, you're right. I used to think he was actually doing work work 'cause I'd be like seriously the kids have just vomited and the house is on fire. But I'm doing stuff. And then I see in the reflection in the window that he was like just designing T-shirts with his friend's face on it saying MAMIL yeah. It started off as a really good hobby, which was brilliant because of his MS, but I think the danger is it's tipping into an obsession. Is it like an affair? Does it become bitter? It probably does. I wonder how many divorces are out there because of a bike rider. Any statistics? Can't really do statistics on that, can you? Mm, yummy. Mm. I think there are a couple of ways of approaching it. One is that indeed the cyclist changes and does less cycling if that's what they want. On the other hand you have your own life. You have your own friends, you do your own thing and that's not necessarily bad. A reasonable night's sleep, which surprised me. I thought I'd be a bit nervous, but yeah it starts in earnest today. Yeah, where are you? All I'm seeing is red. - Oh, sorry, yeah, yeah. - I see nothing now. Oh wow. Australian barrister, Doug Shirrefs is making a call to his partner, Annie back home in Melbourne. I didn't go to work today either, so that makes two of us. Over the last week, Doug has enjoyed the ultimate MAMIL experience following the famous La Vuelta Espana and riding through some of the most scenic and challenging landscapes in Spain. His holiday is nearly over. But before it ends, one final challenge awaits. They're really big hills. You know you look... You might look out here. You just, I think you've just got to not think about it. All right. So. Try and get the tape on. Get some support under the patella. You know I really don't carewhether people think I'm a total wanker. I know that this knee can get so painful that it hurts to walk on. You can get a new knee, but that's a 12 month project. So you just get used to it, you just, You just, you just suck up the pain. We're gonna ride the famous climb of Touramelt, which is probably the... It's not the most famous climb in cycling, but it's the one that's been in the Tour de France the most. Since 1910, many legendary battles between the greats of cycling have been fought out on the Col du Tourmalet. Rising from the Pyrenees to a height of 2,115 metres that's nearly 7,000 feet, the Tourmalet is one of the hardest climbs in cycling. We'll get a group photo. Today the challenge of conquering the Tourmalet, a 32 kilometre climb lures MAMILs from around the world who all want to emulate their heroes. My technique for this will be try and just get comfortable, try and find a rhythm. If there's some longer stretches, maybe have a little bit of a look and try and feel your body a bit. But otherwise I'll be trying to just look at the ground in front of me because otherwise you start looking at it going up too steeply. You can, you know, it can mess with your head. The most important thing is, don't peak too early because the last two kilometres are the steepest. Just ride very much at your own pace. Bonjour. Oh fuck, look at the hill. Makes you want to believe in something other than your legs. Oh, this is beautiful, really beautiful. Meanwhile, on the Ride To Conquer Cancer, best mates Craig and Franko have nearly reached the halfway point. All they need to do now is find the camping ground. Bloody Garman's flat. Where are we going, straight? Go left, guys! Just follow the people like everybody's saying, mate. We're going straight through. Just follow Franko. Jesus. I'm wet, I'm tired, I don't want to ride. Car up! Car up! Well done MAMILs! To the MAMILs, congratulations! You guys are absolute legends. It's taken more than seven hours for Craig and Franko to ride the 100 kilometres to Mandurah. Cheers, boys. Good on you, mate and well done, well done, gentlemen. Cheers. - I ride the ride because I ride for those who can't ride. But my heroes are guys like these guys. Coming from where I've come from where I got very sick every year this is special to me and I get to ride it with my mate. And it's for a good cause. This is my Mum. She's a, a 15 year breast cancer survivor. One of the main reasons I do the ride. Good job, Paul. Woo. It'll be another hundred odd Ks today. As you can see the weather's beautiful today, so hopefully we'll have a bit of a tailwind to blow us back to Perth. - Let's go, fellas. - Go MAMILs, rolling! Hey. I got both good today. Good, mate, yeah. Yeah, yeah, living the dream, tiger. Oh man, my ass. A lot of guys complain about their aching backsides. My secret? Aussie Butt Cream, man, Aussie Butt Cream. Thanks, mate. Craig and Franko are making good time, but the finish line is still a few hours away. On the other side of Australia, local cycling club President, Jayman Prestidge has just taken delivery of a long awaited item. We've got our new club kit that we're releasing. So now we've got to get out and race it. It's not a kit unless it's been raced. I'm wearing the new kit tomorrow, Jayman. Why don't you wear it today? Look how good it is. I don't give a shit what you look like at the coffee shop. When I'm in a race and I look quickly over my shoulder I want to be able to see the Warragul guy. And you don't think that mountains... No! You don't think that's unique? No, it is. The shit I've had to put up with over this is bullshit from blokes like that. Three, two, one. Woo hoo. Cycle racing's actually about inflicting pain on other people. He who can inflict the most pain will actually win. That's probably my biggest weakness. Mentally I actually will go, ah, is it worth this? And as soon as your body and mind thinks that, you're out. It's been a fucking disaster for me today. Mentally destroyed. Ah, there's always next week, eh? I've really run hard during the time that I have been President and I've just been relentless in delivering what the members have wanted. I'm someone that always says, yes, yes, yes and I keep adding things on and on and on. And I know when my body is telling me that I actually do need to just back off and slow down a bit. My health is everything and my family is everything. My cycling is a very, very close third. I've announced that I'm going to stand aside as President. That's gonna allow me some breathing space, I suppose. It's not all about cycling, it's about having fun. Ah, you surrender! I have to say I was pretty relieved 'cause it was taking a lot of time away from the family and kids. If you've got a bureaucratic environment where you've got to tick off 16 people's wishes well it's probably not me. I'd rather do a role where I don't have to expose myself to that. If I get on my bike it's ultimate relaxation. Even if I'm working hard and heart rate's hitting the roof that feeling is better than feeling blue or down. There is an increasing recognition, if you like among the medical profession that cycling can be good for a lot of medical conditions. For example, depression is very good example of that. It's something that seems to affect an awful lot of people in the age group that defines MAMILs. Back in 2012, I wasn't planning to be around for the whole year. I didn't have anything to live for. I'd actually just ridden home. It was a hot day. Got home and ah, I pretty well snapped at that moment over the end of a relationship and ah, literally just collapsed in the shower. It wasn't heatstroke, It was just... Yeah, I know at that moment I sort of just broke. Um, yeah. And sort of yeah... You know thought about how, you know, different ways how I might wrap things up. But um, yeah. Just in the back of my mind it was just, well hang on, I've just, I've got a ride in a couple of months time. And looking forward to it as well. Looking forward to post-ride, sitting down, having a coffee. Hearing the guys laughing and having fun and having a dig at each other. It sort of made your day. So yeah, just having those people in your life. Yeah, it was something to look forward to every other week. I told someone about it 12 months later. That was the thing that kept me around. Certainly we supported him by communicating and talking to him and saying that's, you're not alone, mate. It was the only thing that I had to look forward to. It's just a good feeling to be out there and working together as a group. It's just a good feeling 'cause you're on your game. You're riding well and you know the other guys you're riding with, nothing's gonna go wrong. I've got a couple of the guys that are more like brothers. It's riding with the guys that I ride with, it's certainly what a, yeah, why I'm still here. In the Pyrenees, Australian barrister, Doug Shirrefs is halfway up the Tourmalet. Just stay with yourself. Don't get too far away from yourself. Come on Dougie! Looking great! It's a lot of work from here on. The next kilometer's 7%. There's a lot of switchbacks and it's steep. Doug is battling more than just the mountain. He must also overcome the pain in his left knee. Oh well, here we go. Oh, it's gonna hurt now. In the final section of the climb the gradient increases to an unforgiving 13%. Approaching the summit Doug is forced to zigzag in an effort to keep moving. This is a last resort before he will be forced to walk. Oh, Dougie! Oh, that was a bloody excellent effort, excellent. I just bloody missed the three hours. Fuck. Oh jeez, I tell you what, my legs are screaming. Doug has conquered the Col Du Tourmalet, one of the most difficult climbs in cycling. As the French would say chapeau, Doug. I almost stopped, you know, I reckon probably a K and a half from the top. I've been doing a bit of trainings. But without that training, I wouldn't have made it. A really great achievement, epic achievement. I guess this is what I thought a cycling tour would be all about. You know... Go back to mowing lawns I suppose and practise riding the bike and... Take life less seriously. Are MAMILs a fad? I think probably they aren't because they've been around for a long time now. 20 years ago I wanted cycling to be popular. I wanted everybody to cycle. Do I want that today now? Not so sure. But it's great. There's all these people buying bikes, there's all these people going cycling. The link to charities is one reason why it probably won't just fade away and disappear. 13 kilometres to go. In Western Australia, the MAMILs are making steady, but slow progress. You're out of the saddle again, man. What's going on down there? I think I've got that sweet spot. I'm not getting off the seat now. No, no. A few MAMILs coming through. Jump on the MAMIL train. We start our peloton and our peloton we call the MAMIL train. As we go past people, we always encourage them to hook in with us 'cause if you hook in behind us makes it easier to ride. Car back! Car back! Clear me right! Ease up, dudes. Runs out, guys, runs out! Clear back. Inside rider, inside rider! Hold your line. Single! Single file! Go to single ladies! Pump it, pump it! When I get on my bike I think how fortunate am I. I love riding my bike. I love being a MAMIL. Just going for a little spin. See if I can stay upright. I'm a little bit nervous, I must admit. So wish me luck. Stress is massive, it's a negative energy. You can think yourself ill. Now I can only give you anecdotal evidence about my MS, but if you looked at me 10 years ago and you look at me now, it's like I'm in a different world. This is like the solution. This is the stress buster. This is your moving meditation. We've seen plenty of pain in the hills. We've seen the time trial. We've really experienced just about all of the other aspects of the tour apart from this, the finishing stage. It's part of it, you wouldn't miss it. I'm going to be getting some very wonky photos. It's just a common feature of middle aged men that their lives can get a little bit out of whack from time to time. And I'm happy to put my hand up and say yeah, my life did get a bit out of balance for a while. It did get a bit out of whack. That's about the time that I actually discovered cycling and cycling helped me get my life back into whack. - Hey, Jimmy. - Hey. - Welcome back. - Bruce, yeah. How are you, Tony? The guys have all pretended to be pleased to see me again. - I'm delighted. - Are you? - Yeah, of course. - You're the man, though. Probably. There's a lot of benefits to riding, but there's a very real risk of injury. Interestingly enough, we get back on the bike again. I could have gone out and bought a fast car and looked, you know, looked a bit ridiculous in a Porsche of whatever it is. But I decided actually you know once I started cycling, it just recaptured everything I loved about cycling when I was a kid. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think that it's something that's a fundamental male need. You know, mate-ship. The bond that I have with the people in cycling is the strongest bond I've had with another group of blokes since I was at school. We never thought we'd be still riding at 60 so I was saying there's no reason we shouldn't be riding at 70, or more. Maybe if my wife will let me, I'll still be riding at 70. Let's go, MAMILs! Gav. Jason. This is the bit where I've told Franko not to cry, okay? We try not to, anyway. I am a cardholding member of the MAMIL cycling club if it exists, and if it doesn't exist, it should exist. You know if guys in their 40s get out there, get on the bike, get healthy, get lean, get mean go and start sticking it to some 20 year olds. I mean, that's what it's about. It's about proving to people that age is no barrier anymore. It's all about, you know friends and family and mates and hanging out. Having coffee on weekends. Yeah. - And looking after each other. That's what it's all about. One, two, three. MAMILs! The ultimate goal is if I can stay in shape and everything works and she gets retired our plan is to make our way across the United States. And we'll just take our wheelchair and our gear along with us and ride from place to place. For a little club just east of Melbourne, this would have to be the best looking kit in Australia, hands down. Orica Greenedge were on the phone the other day just saying, hey JP, where'd you get your design done? Who's the fastest in the group? That's a really good question. We've got a couple of guys. Let me have a... I'll go round like this. No, no, no, maybe. Maybe. Definitely not. Maybe. Nah, fail. What's it for? Fastest in the group. Oh, nah. Nah? I think I once looked at his blog. There was a description of how to overtake safely a horse on a country lane, which I thought hysterical, and I thought he was doing, so it was a joke, which it clearly wasn't. And it's quite important because the more cyclings going there and they whiz up the horses, scare the horse, the horse bucks, kick the cyclists, they crash into a car and then it's awful. So it was educational. It was quite funny. You've banned me from wearing Lycra at public occasions. Well he turned up at my son's football in his Lycra. I don't think he even took his helmet off. He sort of waddled in on his shoes that make him look like a duck with the cleats on them, and his full on Lycra and this was before any of the other husbands had started doing it or anything and I was a bit embarrassed. I went, hi, hi! We have a tradition of welcoming new Fat Boys. So Ian, congratulations. - 10 rides. - Thanks, Jim, thank you. All right, it's alright, mate, it's alright. And as such, we'd like to present you with the royal. Thank you very much. Royal robe. Welcome, Ian. He put his hands in his pockets and go out and buy a Fat Boys uniform.
