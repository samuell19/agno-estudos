Oh wait hold on, what if he just puts me in a-- Hey Ronnie struggle, shake your legs. Come on honey. Ow. Good, good, good, okay mask. Oh mask, mask Jody. All right. - Quickly, that's good, now fix your hair, that's good. Okay now Ronnie. - Hey you're enjoying this too damn much. - Kiss him on accident. - There's no such thing as an accidental kiss jackass. Okay wait a minute, I know what you're probably thinking. The guy on top, really looks like he should be the bottom. What can I say, I've never really been the smartest guy in the room, but I'll do whatever I have to to keep my family together. See it all started with our adopted dad Lester. That's his restaurant a couple of years ago. He could barbecue his freaking shoe and make it taste good. Man did he know to feed people. Well until he got sick, and we had to sell almost everything to pay for his last round of treatments. That's his restaurant today. Truth is, I can't do what he did, none of us can. And now that he's gone, we're just trying to keep his legacy alive. We can market this. - Hey try this. It's hard to believe, but a recent study showed that one in 30 kids are homeless. That's a actual statistic we were almost part of. If it wasn't for Lester and our other dad Calvin, yeah I said other dad. It's the 21st century for Christ sakes. But these two ordinary men took a chance on all of us when everyone else turned their backs. Sure they did their fair share of marching, but don't get the wrong idea. This wasn't who they were, this was. They were just regular guys who happened to like other guys. The thing is, we actually got more pissed off when people called them names than they did. Ronnie, Westin, and I, adopted in that order, pretty much grew up together. We all enlisted after high school. We don't talk about too much of it anymore. But Westin barely made it back alive. Last week, he lost his customized wheelchair in a seven-card stud tournament down at the VFW. And just for the record, he was a cock before he was in that chair. - I command respect, it's all in the eyes see. That perfectly disheveled young man taking an earful from Westin, is Jacob. He was adopted about eight years ago. He's a good kid but has one thing on the brain right now. We just want to get him through high school without knocking anyone up. There was one of these I needed your help on. And Georgie here was the most recent addition to the family. She's only been around for a couple of years, but at 11, I'm pretty sure she's already smarter than I am. - Ulnar nerve, also known as? - The funny bone, most people think it's a bone but it's really a nerve. - That's exactly right. - That was a decent show today ladies. Give it a little more agony next time would you. That gorgeous redhead with the thickest head of hair you've ever seen on a man, is Ronnie. When he was nine, his mother actually tried to drown him. She was a real class act. He's been fired up every since. In high school, he was two matches shy of winning state. Hands down, he's the most loyal person I know. - Crazy for you. - You're $40 short. And that toolbox with the tampon hanging out of his nose is me Jody. My mom's nicest boyfriend used to hit me with a brick. I mean shit I was born at a truck stop somewhere between hear and Barstow. If it wasn't for this family, no doubt I would have ended up in serious trouble. But I chose not to let the darkness define me. Responsibility changes a man. Knowing you've been fighting for shit as long as we have, really just becomes a way of life - Look they're stuck together I swear. Sure. - You guys think about doing those fetish matches all right. You plus fetish equals prison Benny. That's a funny one Ronnie. Ah, Jesus Tiny I said I was sorry. - Oh hey, gie us a minute would you? We don't want to ruin it for you with every other guy. - I can risk it. - I want to talk to Benny about winning a few. - It's not worth it bro. - Ain't you tired of being a loser though? - I just wanna make barbecue Ronnie. - You will, just tired of this guy disrespecting us. I'll be nice, I promise. You trust me? - I trust you. - You gonna destroy your liver you keep using too much of that crap. - Stop, ah don't drink that man. Do you know how many germs are in and on that bag Ronnie. You get a parasite, it could live inside your body for like 15 years, you know that right? - Uh-huh. - Sick old man. Tammy, where's my ice? Damn it woman I ask you to do one thing. - One thing my ass Ronnie Lackey. What about all that products I bought for your stupid hair? - I'll beat your ass woman. - You ain't gonna beat shit gingerbread man. If you want your ice, you can get in here and get it yourself. Move over. - What are you doing, you can't. - Get over. There's not enough room Ronnie. Just go in there and get your damn ice. - I ain't gone give her the satisfaction. - What are you still seeing her for? - I love her. Isn't she married? - Yep, and he's more of a prick than you are. I'm her boy toy, no strings attached, just unbridled passion. - You're a moron. - Love is complicated Westin. - But it's young and dumb if you ask me. - I heard that Ronnie Lackey. - Speaking of love Pop, three more new guys contacted you on that dating website. - For the last time Westin, take me off that thing, I'm not ready. And come on and help me clean this place up before we eat. Michelle is swinging by later. - Michelle's coming by today? She is indeed. - She's with someone Ronnie. - Aww, it went down my blouse bro. - Not anymore, her and Trevor broke up. - Really? - Why can't we just keep her as our case worker? - Yeah, Dorothea smells like leftover sauerkraut. - That's just the way the system works guys. - If you don't hit it, I will. Aww, you son-of-a. You can't hit me. - Georgie you're grounded. Anytime Westin comes near me you gotta let me know okay, okay. - Bless this food, and let us give thanks for Georgie, finally becoming an official member of this family. Daddy Lester would be so proud of each and every one of you. We may not have a lot, but we have enough, amen. Amen. - It's okay Dad, he's still here with us. - Oh here, put this in the family account for me. So Jimmy insists that he's got someone lined up to move in in three weeks if we don't sign the new lease. - How are we supposed to afford another grand a month? - I know a lot of good memories came from that restaurant, but maybe we should reconsider some of the other ideas. - No, we'll make it work. - You gotta better chance of me walking again. - How much you lost playing cards on the internet this week Westin? - He's actually up 500 this week. - Thank you Jacob. You see Ronnie, I'm pulling my weight around here. You're just jealous because I'm gonna be the first handicap World Series Of Poker champion. And you two, are gonna continue to be world champion punching bags. - You're a dick Westin. - Georgie, that's enough. Apologize to the boys Westin. - What? Apologize. - Oh yeah, thanks Pop, blame it on the handicap. - You want to get all up in that, I can hook it up. - No, no, no, don't. No, don't hook anything. Hi guys. Hi, hey. - How you doing? - Oh Jody, Jody wants to show you his nuts. - Dammit Westin, really. I'm gonna kick his ass. - Maybe I'll start with an iced tea first. - You're an asshole Westin. Yeah and I love you too. I'm going make a c-note, Jackass. - Prick. - Oh, nice to see there's still some consistency around here. - I'm sorry about that Michelle. - Oh don't be, last week a 10 year old called me a whore and elbowed me in the boob all at the same time. Him showing me his nuts would be a welcomed improvement. Sorry. No, no, no. - Did I embarrass you? - Oh God, I'm gonna go get you an iced tea, excuse me. - Georgie, give me some of this sugar, hi. So how's the restaurant coming? - In a week or so we should be able to buy back everything that we sold off to pay for Lester's last treatment. - Okay. - Excuse me. - Yeah, smells good. - Yeah, oh here you want a plate? - I would love one. - You need to make your move. - Holy shit where did you come from? - I'm part time ninja baby. Boo, sweet buttercream, hmm. Easy. - She's such a good baker. Yeah, try that. - Get the hell. - Take a bite dammit. You see what I'm talking about? - Oh man. It's delicious. - Did you wash your hands. Don't ever touch my face. This is delicious isn't it? - Oh wow. - Listen, you need to make your move. A woman like this won't be on the market for long. - She's not a house Ronnie. - Foundation, structure, stability. Every woman's a house bro. - I'm not ready yet. - Oh yeah that's right, I forgot, you're waiting for your vagina to blossom into a penis. Ready for what, make your move man. - Think about it, she has what, like a master's degree and I barely finished high school. - That doesn't matter. - It doesn't matter to you because you can talk to anybody about anything. I can't do that. - Yes you can. - No I can't, I get really nervous around her okay. I don't wanna look like some outclassed idiot. So please, please, just leave it alone. - Not a chance. You got street smarts and that trumps book smarts when it comes to dames all day long, all right. You can do this. It's in your eyes, you got that fight look in your eyes. Yeah, what? - Do I stink? Yeah, yeah a little bit. But you smell like a man, it's alluring. It is, that's good, keep your arms down though. - Do I smell more like a tiger or a monkey? - Probably a tiger, it's like you're at the gym working out. - You sure. - But when you first got in there, not when you're leaving. All right, that's good. Keep your arms down though. There you good. - You're so good, thank you. You're welcome. - Hmm, you know I do have one more house to get to though. I cannot wait 'til this is all up and running so we can do this more often. Seven o'clock Saturday. - Excuse me? - You're taking me out. - I am? Mm-hmm, just give me a call and I will get you the address. - Okay. - You know you smell really good. Wear that Saturday. - Little miss matchmaker. - No sense beating around the bush, I like her. - Me too. Can I have a bite? - No, you need to cut back. - Oh really, and what is this? - Nothing. - You know what, I don't your permission, move. I made the damn thing. Hey, hey. What? - You stay out of 'em, I'm not joking. You eat like a linebacker woman, I'm trying to help you. - She can have one Ronnie. Horse shit there's only three left, she'll finish 'em. Ronnie will you put that thing away, we're in broad daylight. Oh my little pastry chef. You taste like sweet buttercream. Oh you're so hot. - I don't remember, right or left up here? - Go right. Right bro, go right. Break your hip. - Is your husband ever home? Don't talk about him. - No God, I just wanna kiss you all over you. Gotta save some I got a match tomorrow. Whoo! Thanks for the drive son. Hey Fred, it's Jody Lackey again calling about the kitchen stuff. When you get a second give us a call back will you, thanks. I'm wired Jod, I'm gonna explode if I don't get rid of some of this energy. - No, what you need to do is stop eating so much damn sugar. - Let's go dancing, huh? - What? - Dancing stud dancing, dancing. - Just save your energy, we've got a long freaking day tomorrow. - Dancing, dancing. Yep right here. What are we gonna do about this lease. - Well we got enough for the first month. Then what? - Beats me buddy. - Hey, what I tell you? No eating on my clock. - You have open sores on your what? - You say these things to me in my country, I cut your tongue out fuck pig. - That's easy, it was just a few eggs and some bacon. Everybody's still working their asses off. - They haven't had a break all morning. A hungry kitchen is a slow kitchen. What's with the pitcher? - I have to make shit. - In a pitcher? - No, you idiot. I cannot use American paper. Look you eat, no pay, you steal. - That's not how you run a business man. - Accuse me of business, ha, I piss on me. - I think what he meant was he laugh so hard he piss himself. You like funny, I give you funny. You both fired. - Fine you know what-- - Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey. Who you gonna have cook? - Hector. - That's Juan. - Whatever. - No offense to Juan, but your customers will walk out. - Comprende el ticketo. - You need to eat before shift. - You're right, we will. - In my country, we kill firehead for fun, watch it. - I'm gonna kick that asshole's teeth in. - No you're not. We just need to follow his stupid rules and you need to check your anger until we can afford to leave, got it? - All right fine. What was with that pitcher? Whoo! - You're a loser Lackey! It's just weird and I don't wanna do it anymore that's all. - Well it's not as weird and uncommon as you think Vic. Hell Jody sits when he pees. - Shut up. - Yeah I have an abnormally large urethra. - It's like a straw. - He let's you see it. - Yeah about 10 years ago. He wanted me to check it out and make sure there was nothing wrong with him. - Just because you got a big pee-pee hole don't mean you gotta sit. - It does if you don't want to change your panties five times a day. - It's freakish. - So you basically gotta wipe yourself like a chick. - More or less. - Look Vic, just 'cause your son sits when he pees doesn't mean he's gay. Neither of our dads ever sat to pee and they're gay as shit. - Maybe you need to check his urethra. - You need to work on your stamina Ronnie. And both of you, you need to coordinate your reactions better okay. The minute he kicks like this, you punch, head goes back. He kicks, uh, uh, punch, head goes back, you got it? You guys are gonna love this. The client got a hold of me. They really want you guys to go with those hillbilly accents we were talking about so really beef 'em up okay. And I got you costumes too. - Hey Bennie. - Yeah? - How 'bout we get to win a few more. Maybe going from heels to heroes. - The crowd will never go for that. - Well sure they will. - Nah, come on. You guys already win enough to keep it interesting. And every winner needs a good loser, you guys are my best losers. It just comes natural to you, I don't know what to say. You keep working on your stamina. Please, work out the timing. All right, see you later. Ah shit! Dammit! - You okay? Let me see, no let me see. - No I'm fine man, I can't work another damn double in this place. - What the fuck is going on in here? Oh, you pay for this firehead. - Hey don't you touch me man. - Clean it, clean. - Fuck you crazy ass, I fucking quit. - Hey, hey, hey Ronnie. - I'm not a loser Jody. Get the fuck outta my way. - Firehead, he's weak. Back to work. - Farthest thing from it. - Hey, you do not walk out on me. Get back here! Shit fuck. - Ronnie. I'm tired of making this guy all the money we should be making bro, don't worry about it. I'll talk to Benny, we can get some more matches. You're doing great Jody, you're strong. You're like an ox. You know one thing I like to thing about is what a good lover I am before we go into a mania. I think about that and I can pretty much get us anything. Where do you come up with this shit? - Well everybody's always said to me, every since I was like 12. - Push harder ladies. Come on man. - I'm pushing, it's hard. You've been doing it the whole time so why don't you just keep going, company eon tough guy. This was your idea, you're doing good. This is making you strong. You're doing good, look at you man. Your freaking triceps is bulging out of that shirt. Will you maybe turn around. - Well I can't access my shoulder, my shoulder is a little bit sore when I push like that. You're doing good, keep going. Just 20 more feet. - Come on guys, let's move it. Yeah Georgie, right here, let's sit it here, that's good. Jody, you want to drive the rest of the way? So if he says he didn't call us back because there's another offer on the table, we pull out our cash right then and there and we say pow, is that offer as real as this Fred Chombers? - But what if he's bluffing and dodging us so we think that but there is no other offer. I mean the last we talked to him, he was ready to go. - I guarantee you he's playing sales games with us. But no one balks at immediate cash. This is all we have, take it or leave it, or eat my wiener Fred Chombers. Hey man, you see Fred Chombers? - Who? - The guy who owns this place. We're buying some of his equipment. - The IRS came by like a week ago and cleaned out all of his stuff, he's gone. We're never gonna find a deal like that again. It doesn't matter now Ronnie, he's gone, we gotta move on. - Don't say anything in front of dad. - We're up to 97 followers this week. You guys think we should post something? - Yeah post this. Give me a bite of that. - No Jacob, Ronnie's in training. Sorry dude. Give me a bite of that. How was the auction dad? - I picked up a Victorian bedroom set. A couple of nasty gashes in the headboard scared everybody off but I knew I could fix her up without a trace and still sell it for at least triple what I nabbed her for. Oh whenever I get a smell of this hickory, it reminds me of him, damn scent. It was soiled in all his clothes. - A real barbecue man. Chops his own wood. - Maybe it really is time for you to start dating again. - Oh I appreciate your concern Ronnie, but today's man is either looking for a sugar daddy's bank account or for pecs like your brother's here. - Maybe, maybe not, but you deserve to be happy. - He's right dad, you still have dreams and stuff don't you? - It's not that simple Jody. - You adopted five strangers no one else wanted. Nothing you do is simple pop. - You took car of everyone your whole life, including Lester. You'll never replace him, we know that, but you need to go out and have some fun. He's right Dad, we'll handle things for a while. You and the damn tears. - I can't help it, I'm just so proud of you boys. - You see now you gone make me cry dad. - Son-of-a-bitch. Well we had to give it one last try. Normal people just can't get ahead Jody. Maybe they're just afraid of your hair. It's extra big today. - Get off it's humid, just drive. - Hey forget about the banks, we don't need 'em. We'll do it ourselves. I didn't expect them to give us anything any way. - I'm just, I'm just tired of hearing no. Do it again, go down. - Oh come on guys, at least wait until we get out of the ring. - Don't be waiting, fetish matches is the way of the future. Yeah maybe so, but I don't know who wants to pay to see you two sons of bitches dressed up like that. - We got this Eastern European fella paying 500 bucks a piece to see two bears in a crotch match. - Tell you what, I'll pay you each a thousand right now, if you never use the words crotch and match in the same sentence again. - So I've been thinking about this date you've got coming up. You should feed her as much tequila as possible, and then you can talk about anything from corn to porn and she'll probably still mount you. - This is your advice, get her shit faced and she'll let me bang her? This ain't high school kegger Vic. - Well you can just let the universe guide you and just be there, I mean really be there. She'll at least give you the hand job. - A hand job, what's a freaking hand job, that's like letting someone else come your hair. - All right, sorry I'm late ladies. I just had to get my phone. Well look at you, fabulous. Little pretty dolls. - Hey Benny. You still set us up with some of these matches. - Really? You know I knew you'd boys would come around. I'll tell you what, this guy Casper here, he just last week had a man sit on his face for 60 seconds for 200 bucks. - We're not doing weird shit like that. - Just imagine what they're gonna pay you. - Well we get to pick and choose what we do still right. - Yeah gladiator stuff, tough guy shit. - Of course, of course, I promise you. - Macho shit, you got it Benny. - Only manly shit. - No sitting on his face freak show. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, I promise you, only macho stuff. Like maybe some Nordic shit, we'll get you a boat in here. You guys can be like two gladiators riding in a boat across the shores of Norway. How 'bout that? - Vikings. - We'll put it all together, it'll be a big fucking macho soup. Took me a long time to get in here and prove to these people that I was worth it, so if you say you're gonna do it, you better commit. - What's the matter with you guys, have some self respect. - Hey be sure to check in on Foursquare on your way out. I'm trying to build up some business. Okay guys, so you get down in the scissor. So you're on the ground first. And you're in here, come on Casper, you get right here. And you scissor, right around his, perfect, perfect. Okay, now you, you're gonna lock him tight, and you start blowing on his nuts. Just start blowing really hard on his nuts. Come on Ronnie, let's cover it up. Come on Jody, pull. - Mom. - Why does he say mom? - 'Cause she stabbed him in the face with a hypodermic needle. - Mom. - And that gets him fired up and he can lift more. - Mom. Time, switch. Go. - Let's go over all this again. Color of the heart chakra. - Green. First person to ever reach the summit of Mount Everest? - Chuncko Tibei. Nye strait. - I don't remember. I don't think we're gonna be talking about real estate during the first date guys. - Never know. - You can never have too many topics for conversation Jody. Time. I just wanted to see if it would work for me too. - Talk to her about animals, women love animals. - A porcupine might have as many as 30,000 quills. - How do you know that? - Hey, you can always steal a few of my moves. You pop the head off right, you toss it up in the air. You catch it, take it down, then move it around. Ooh shift it, shift it this way. Shift it that way, and give it back. - Yeah maybe, maybe I'll do that. You guys hungry. - Shouldn't we wait for Daddy Calvin. He's out for the night. - Come on. I think we're the first guys to ever work out so hard to open a barbecue joint. Pancreas, respiratory system. - Fibula. - Tibia. - Tibia, no, no, I saw what it was. - Nice try Jody, but I got you there. - UCLA better look out. - You really think so? - Absolutely honey, if that's what you want, I promise you, I promise you we will make it happen. Right now, you need to go take a shower and get ready for bed okay. - Thanks Jody. - I love you. - Hey I don't care what any girl says, you cover that up. - He's right Jacob, unless you're ready to have a kid or be exposed to what I like to call the three h's. HIV, HPV, or hepatitis. - I'm with Jody on this one. - What does HPV even mean? - Human papillomavirus, warts, cancer. It can just lie dormant in your system for years. It's a silent epidemic. - I don't want a silent epidemic. No you don't want one. - It's just that I'm embarrassed to buy 'em. - Well then you're not old enough to have sex yet. - No it's just, none of them fit right. - What do you mean they don't fit right, is it crooked or something? - No it's just, kind of big. And I'm embarrassed to buy the larger ones. - Embarrassed, hell son you ought to throw that thing down on the counter for the cashier to take a look at before you leave the store. - Really? - Yes. - No not really, he's just kidding. - Horse shit I'm kidding. The only way we could wear one of those is with a rubber band. You own that Jacob, you hear me. I can see the outline, it's making me uncomfortable. Hey boys. - Woman, where have you been? You missed dinner. - Yeah but I'm right on time for desert. Is this the kind you were telling me about. No. - What, I'll run an extra mile tomorrow. Hmm. - Oh baby, you have it all over your face. No, no. Mm-hmm. This is the kind that he likes. You're so sweet. - Give me a kiss. - You're fucked! Got! I can't breathe in this damn thing! What do you expect, you can't breathe because you're out of shape still. Listen to me I got one word for you, cupcakes. - Deer velvet. - Say what? Deer velvet. - They take it from the antler of a deer. It acts like a human growth hormone. Cool thing is, it doesn't hurt the deer at all and it's all natural. - Wait a minute, isn't that like saying cocaine is an all natural stimulant. - All I know is it works. We've been taking this stuff for a couple of months now, and we've never been more alert or stronger. Last week, put up 300 on bench. - Horse shit. - The most powerful stuff we found was from New Zealand, check it out. - Oh god it smells like deer piss from Pittsburgh. - Well then give it back to me. - Whoa, whoa hold on, how do you take it? - Spray it in the back of your mouth. - I do this, I'm not gonna go running out to the street in the middle of the night and get hit by a car or something am I? - The only side effect we seen, it makes our skin a little oilier. And we like to eat a lot more salt. - This is ridiculous. - I ain't the one who's body's breaking down now am I? There are a bunch of top athletes taking this stuff. But it's kind of cutting edge for you boys, I understand. - Benny know you guys are doing this? - Benny, Benny he doesn't care if we're shoving firecrackers up our ass. As long as we give him a good show. - Ugh it's gross. - Yeah, they need to work on the flavoring a little bit. - Hey, if you keep this really hush-hush, I'll send you the link to the website. But I don't want anybody, anybody, stealing our edge. - Thank you. - Okay. - The least we can do is give it a shot. - Look at these two guys after what, two months of using this, they're still in way worse shape than we've ever been. - Exactly, imagine how much better it'll work for a couple of studs like us. - No thanks. - God it's just awful, it really is. Okay now, Ronnie. Hey you're enjoying this too damn much. Kiss him on accident. - There's no such things as an accidental kiss jackass. - Just, the client said that they're gonna pay an extra hundred bucks for every accidental sign of affection. So from where you guys come from, it's perfect. - Just because our dad's gay doesn't mean we are. If you want guys that kiss you should have got a couple of actual gay dudes. - Guys they requested you two jamokes. - How 'bout he pull the hair. - The really, well you can pull your hair too. But you guys, they specifically want straight dudes in questionable situations. - How this? - Lips touching ain't questionable Benny. Okay, all right fine. - Can I get a pillow? - Fine look, I'll put my arm under your head. Is that good, and I'll just hide over here. - A little higher, a little higher. Yeah, yeah, yeah, okay right here. But now, listen, you girls. - Don't call us girls. You need to nuzzle neck, nuzzle him. - What's a nuzzle? - I'll show you. Just put your head, put your nose right in his neck. Wait, wait, wait, other side, not so deliberate. - Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait if we start here. What if we start here and I'll just go across like this. - Oh God, it's like sandpaper man, oh, oh. - Are you hard? - No. - Full mouth, come on full mouth, focus. - I'm gonna get my arm here, I'm gonna roll you this way. No, keep your leg there, keep your leg there. Just move your, move that over. - Just don't cut my mat, I don't have an extra $1500. - Put your heels, get my thigh right. - All right one, two, three, go. - Oh dammit. - It's okay. Oh you dick. Okay, okay. - Arms in or out. - In, well we want in, we want out. Oh stop it, just get it man. Oh gross, I just touched your thing. - That's good, that's an extra hundred bucks, that's good. That's disgusting. - You know don't you joke about thangs. Remember when I had my surgery, they did my thang surgery so good that I can sit on a blond dart and not even feel it. That's disgust-- Oh, God you farted on me! I'm sorry. - That's like an extra 200 bucks right there. Oh shit, let me out man. You got me over here stinking. Okay, you know what? Look at all the jewels on your dress, it's so beautiful. You guys are killing me here. Great, let's just sit here and smell that okay. - Yeah I can, I can't help it. - Look I got it, I got it, it's okay. - Do you clean this mat man? - No, I never clean the mat. It's preserved integrity from like all the wrestlers who's have walked on this mat. I got it, that's it ladies. I got everything I need to put this together. You just do me a favor and take care of those dresses. All right you guys. - Just make her laugh son. That's the key to any good relationship. - You sweat so much. - You think I should put the other shirt back on? - Uh-uh, shirt's perfect. You sure. Mm-hmm. - These jeans make your dick look great. - Hey come here, come here, come here. Oh. - Seriously, I just brushed dad. - The human mouth can never be fresh enough. - All right, thanks. - Oh, oh, oh Jesus, hold on kiddo. This shirt is already getting wet. You cannot sit in that car like that. All right, appreciate it guys. - Hey remember, if all else fails, animals and tequila. I'm half a fag aren't I? - Yeah, but that's all right. It balances out that temper of yours. - One sec. Hey. - Hey, hey you look great. - Thank you, so do you. - I didn't realize how many colors of roses they have now, so ... - Hmm, thank you. - What was that for? - Well my friend said if you did something romantic to let you kiss me. So I figured I'd get it out of the way. Plus if we didn't connect with the kiss, then what's the point right? - So you talked to your friends about me? Guilty. I haven't been on a date in six years, so I needed a little help. Did you talk to your friends? - A little. - But did you talk to Ronnie? - Yeah, yeah. - What they day? - They told me to be a gentleman and talk about animals. - You are so full of shit. What did they really say. - If I tell you, you'd probably run in there and slam the door in my face and I really want to take you out Michelle. - Well I would like that? - You would? - Yeah, have you ever been on a hunger date? - No, what's that? You are in for a treat. ♪ I draw him closer to me ♪ ♪ My constant friend is he ♪ ♪ For his eye is on the sparrow ♪ ♪ His eye is on the sparrow ♪ ♪ And I know he watches me ♪ ♪ I sing because I'm happy ♪ ♪ I sing because I'm free ♪ ♪ For his eye is on the sparrow ♪ ♪ And I know he watches me ♪ - Hmm, no we literally had to rush him the hospital when he learned the news that I was leaving law school to become a social worker. We thought he was having a heart attack. - Holy shit. - No, he was fine. He's a helpless narcissist who's only thinking about himself, honestly. I mean he's still not very happy with me. But it's not like I was gonna spend my entire life doing something you know for him, so he could go talk to his fair weathered friends at the country club about me. Champagne problems. Like I had it so bad compared to you. - Except for being abandoned, I had a pretty normal childhood. - That's true. After your mom died, did you ever think that you'd want to find your dad again? That was too much, I didn't mean to ask that right now. That was like ... Hmm, I mean I could ask that if that's what I. - I saw, you had a little ketchup there. - Oh, I may have some ketchup right there too. - Where. - Right there. - Oh I see it. - Yeah, get in there. Okay, I was going to let you in but I'm not going to because ... I don't want you to think I'm one of those girls. - It's too late. - That's so mean. - I'll never sleep with a girl on the first date anyway. - Oh really? - The thought of it alone sickens me. - Oh. I respect your principles. - A girl's got to have her standards. - Okay, you need to leave. - Okay. - You have to leave. - All right. - I mean but really there's you know, the number of times I have been in your house because of Jacob and Georgie, it's not really the first date right. So maybe you should stay. - Good point. - Jody. - Hey, good morning. - Morning. - I was gonna make you some breakfast, but I figured you didn't want a mayonnaise and baking soda omelet. - Yeah, about that. I haven't been cooking now that's it's just me. - That's okay, I made you some coffee though. - Ooh, thank you. Hmm, were you sitting to pee? - Could we maybe save that conversation for next time. - Oh next time. - Yeah I was-- - There's gonna be a next time. - I really hope so, yeah. - There's gonna be a next time. - Hey, have you seen my shirt? - No. - I've been looking everywhere for it. - Can I feel your lats like one more time. - What? How do you even know what a lat is? - Well I grew up with two brothers, I think I know what lats are. - Ooh it's cold, it's cold. - Sorry cold hands. It's cold, it's cold, it's cold. - Whoa, holy shit. - What. - That is. - You think it's too much? - I think these are bigger than mine. - No they're not, yours is beautiful. Yours are bigger than mine. Right? Stop it. - Wow, what do you feed these things? That tickles. - Hey this one gets fed in the morning, this one. - Hey, hey, don't you have to go to work or something? - I do but this is much more fun. Plus, this is my place. - Oh, yeah I kind of forgot. Mm-hmm, right. - All right, I'll let you get ready. - I would live to see you wrestle. - Trust me you don't. - Yeah. - It's actually a pretty scary sight. - Oh really? Yeah. - I think I can handle it. I'm a social worker remember. - Jody] Aww. - Plus I got strong heart. - That was the rib I cracked last week, right there. - Really? - No, I'm just kidding. I'm sorry. - I'm just kidding. - To the rib. - If you really want to, we've got a match later. I'll text you the address. - Okay. - But I'ma warn you right now, it's enter at your own risk because this shit, this shit, is for real. Mm-hmm, I can see that. Get off me, stop hitting me. If you hit me again, I'm gonna knock your fucking teeth in. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, stop it. - Accused me of stealing, I'm gonna break your ugly face. - Hey, hey, what's going on? - Go ahead and tell 'em Westin. - Won't you suck my Irish ass. What are you two talking about? - Where's your shirt? - I don't know. - Hey how was your date? - It was pretty great actually Dad. She was-- - I don't want to say anything in front of dad. - It's a little late for that now isn't it. What is this? - We lost the Fred Chombers deal. - What? - I didn't want to upset you, I found another kitchen for sale though, but when I went into the family account, there was five grand missing. - I didn't take it, I only gamble the money that I win. I just put $200 in there you ass. - The only thing that makes me madder than you taking it, is you not being man enough to admit. Come on try it, try it. Come on half man. I'll put you in a rear neck and choke you, you'll never wake up from. - Stop it dammit. He didn't take anything, I did. - Horse shit. - No, with everything you boys had going on, I thought I'd be able to replace it all before anyone noticed. - Seriously? - There was limited space on this trip to Italy I found and I wanted to secure a spot. I guess you boys are right, I do still have dreams. - When meant go out and polish a few knobs, not take a freaking European vacation Dad. - Don't worry, the money will all be back there before the new lease starts. - We need it now. - I thought you had locked down the kitchen deal and we had a cushion. If you boys had told me what was going on, I never would have bought the ticket and all of this could have been avoided. - You never wanted us to reopen. - Ronnie. - I want what's best for you boys - We made a promise to Dad, all right we can't let him down. - Lester, Lester's whole life was overrun by that place. We never got to do any of the things we talked about. When I see everything pushing against you boys, I just don't want you to end up like him. - Wait a minute Pop, why don't we just take a second and reevaluate everything here. - What does that supposed to mean? - It means we're making ends meet here. I mean the stuff that we're buying, we're paying twice what we paid for it orignally. - No shit, but what are we supposed to do? Fetish matches for the rest of our lives? - Of course not Ronnie, he's just trying to help. - We could always ask Benny for a loan. - Yeah right, the last thing we want to do is owe that creep anything. - Yo let's go meet with this other guy you found and see what we can do. - This is fucked up Dad. - Yeah I'm sorry son. - It's all right Dad, we should've kept you in the loop. We'll figure it out though, but you're still going on that trip, you're still going. - I really wish I could help you fuckers out. But they come in with an offer, $6,000 more than yours. - We have cash. - So do they. - Dammit. You're not playing sales games with us are you? - I wish the hell I wasn't 'cause I don't like them one little bit, goddamn immigrant motherfuckers. Those guys come in like they own the place. What does an Egyptian know about pulled pork? - Sounds a lot like the guy we used to work for. - I'll fuck all their virgins and convert 'em to hookers in 72 hours. Fuck them. You know the only reason I'm selling this place, my sweet little wife. The bitch that she is runs off with my hostess, fucking lesbian. - Sorry to hear that Jerry. - Don't be sorry for me. Fucking bitch, I wish she had left 25 years ago. If she would've I'd a been much better off. I'd a been running my own little village in Thailand. Did you know you can own a Thai hooker for 40 bucks a day? - Sounds like a pretty healthy decision Jerry, good luck with that. - Let us know if they change their mind will ya. - You guys ever thought about taking your operation mobile? - Excuse me? - Boys this right here is Mable. I was getting ready to branch out all over town with her. I'm a tell you something, all she needs is a carburetor and a freezer and she'll be ready to roll. Y'all take a look. - No thanks. - Wait, we should at least check it out. - No, I'm not interested. - Just think about the possibilities, I mean we could-- - I'm not cooking in a glorified roach coach. - These things are sweeping the town. - It's not Dad's kitchen. Guys like us aren't meant to get ahead. - Hey, we still got options here. Just because it's not working out the way we want it to doesn't mean, it doesn't mean it's over. I really think we should consider this food truck thing Ronnie. - After everything we've done, I don't want to have to take five steps back. - It's not five, it's more like five steps sideways. Man I know you're the number man and everything, but we can save a lot of money in the long run with this thing right? - 'Til the truck breaks down or it's raining outside or cold. - Southern California Ronnie, I don't think we're gonna have to worry about the weather. Lester's legacy, it's in the food, not in some building. It's always right here, it's where it started, but we don't have to, we don't have to be there to have it be here. - I guess it'd be cheaper. - I'm sure we can find a doable number on the truck. - Now, even if Dad didn't take that money, we wouldn't have enough to make a serious offer. - We just have to wrestle a little longer than we orignally had planned. - I told you I don't want to owe that creep Benny anything. - It's just an advance Ronnie, Benny's harmless. - What about interest? - The contract said we could pay it off in matches. - You signed a contract? - I always go along with everything you say and do, I never argue. All I'm asking is one time for you to trust me. This is gonna work. And guess what, he's gonna let us win some more. - For real? - Yeah, your baby brother takes care of you man. - Yeah. - Oh. Yeah, shut up. Easy, easy, easy, watch him. Get over there, careful, easy, easy. - Dammit, I heard it pop as soon as I want down. Are you sure? - Yeah. - Hey do you need me to call an ambulance? - Yeah probably. - No what Michelle, we don't have insurance. - I'm sorry Jody, I screwed up the timing out there buddy. - Hey what the hell was that? - It was an accident Benny. - But you can still wrestle right. Look I got two matches coming up and I don't know what to do. Hey get the fuck outta here! What's the matter with you Benny? Are you kidding me, coming in here, he's killing his self out there for you. At least ask him if he's all right. - Yeah, not cool Benny. - I'm sorry okay, I apologize. - Just let us take Thursday off Benny, we'll be good for Saturday. - What the hell are you talking about? - Ronnie we can't quit now. I just won't be able to move from side to side. I'm gonna be fine. - Are you sure? - Ronnie there's a pair of crutches over there in the storage locker, why don't you go get 'em. I'll keep you on the schedule though all right. - Wait a second, I mean surely you have liability coverage right? - Who the hell is this? - No, no, no, Michelle, thanks but it's on me. All the matches you could have seen, I can't believe this is the one you come to. I'm so sorry. - Well I thought you were great. Well now we just need to keep you off that knee. You need to get some rest. I'll call you tomorrow when I have a break, yeah. Stay off that leg. - Thanks. I'm sorry Ronnie, I made the wrong choice. The one time I jump the gun and make a decision for both of us, this is what happens. I should have never signed a contract with Benny. You were right, I don't know what the hell I was thinking. I should have listened to you. Now he's counting on us too and there's no way in hell he's gonna let us out of this thing. All I keep hearing in the back of my freaking head is the last thing my mother told me before she killed herself. Life will disappoint you and you will disappoint life. 20 some years now and that one little sentence still keeps me up at night. Always trying to find a way to prove her wrong. But what if she's right Ronnie? I mean what if I can't wrestle like this? I just, I don't want to let anybody down bro. You're the most reliable person I know. You couldn't let anyone down, even if you tried. You hear me? Your mother was a dick, don't listen to anything she ever had to say to you. What's a three letter word for a small amount beginning with T. Your mother was a dick. - Hey how are you? Don't listen to anything she ever had to say to you. - Where are your pants? - Tad. Oh, hey. - This is, this is ... - Rod. - Rod, he just bought the bedroom set. - Pleased to meet you. - Did you wash your hand? - No, sorry. - Dad, what are you doing? Where are the kids and where are your pants? - The kids are at tutoring. What's the matter with your leg son? - Pants. - What? - Pants Dad, pants. - All right, all right, all right. Oh Rod, I'm afraid I'm gonna have to offer you a rain check on that caprese salad, okay. Arrivederci, grazie. - Prego, arrivederci. - Seriously Dad. - What, he just blew me. - Oh come on, I don't want hear the details. - Are you okay Jody. - I think I just tore my ACL again Dad. - Oh no son I'm sorry. Here let me get some ice for you. - Hold on, you can't just be bringing guys named Rod back to the house to give you head. - Don't judge me, I'm trying to reinvent myself. - You're what? - After we had that talk last week, I realized that I'd be lucky if I have a good 15 years left in me. And it scared the bejeezus out of me. I'm not living, I'm dying. - Don't say that Dad. - I love you boys so much, but I am not gonna die in this house like Lester did, without ever seeing the coast of Tuscany or the basilicas in Rome. - It's fine Dad, it really is. But you could have talked to us about this before you just went all balls out, literally. - You boys are so wonderful when it comes to so many things, but change is definitely not one of them. - We're getting better. - It'd be hard to get any worse. Remember when you were in high school and I finally made you get rid of your superhero sheets. It would have seemed like we were sending you back into the system. - Those days were freaking awesome. - Yeah, but you two would still be sleeping on 'em if I hadn't taken 'em away from you. - Well maybe. - And I'd still be stuck in reverse if it wasn't for you. Here. This is the money from the bedrooms set. - Sorry for yelling at you Dad. - Death will find us alive boys. He'll find us alive, you hear me? - Push it, come on, push it. One more, come on, one more. - Tell 'em Georgie. - Get up Ronnie, get up. - Mom, Mom. - Time. Oh. Oh it's nothing like a Turkish get-up. - Nice job kid. - The followers really love that we can come to them. - That's great, let's see. Oh hey you got a text from Jessica. How's it feeling? - It's a little wobbly, but probably meant to be used right? - Keep strengthening those quadriceps Jody. It'll protect the knee. Here, take some of this. I'm gonna get you some ice, to keep the swelling down. - Thanks doctor. - No hand sanitizer? - I'm trying to cut back. - Power of a woman. She's got you bro, doesn't she? She call you yet? You call her, if that date went half as well as you said it did, you don't play any games. She didn't miss a beat the other night when you hurt your knee. There's something there, you want to talk to her, you call her. Let death find you alive right. - Can you take too much of that stuff? - I doubt it, you sure you don't want some? Come on. - No, I'm positive. - All right. - What's the difference between an American deer and one from New Zealand? - Accent I suppose. Hey, you bagging that boa constrictor like we talked about? - Yes I am. - Good man, every time you hear us. You take that thing out and throw it up on the counter like we told you to? It's a real show piece I'm sure. - Hey Michelle it's Jody, I just wanted to call and say thanks again for being there last night. I'd really like to see you again, so whenever you get a chance just give me a call will you, thanks. Mom, mom. - Sorry about that face shot bro. You know what, you guys suck. You need to show up to freaking practice sometimes. - He's in no condition to be wrestling out there like that. - He can out wrestle you with both his knees blown out. You know what, get the hell outta here. - You know what, we don't want to work with you anymore any way, we'll find somebody else. - I am all about splitting the crowd here, but that was about as pain free as letting my 450 pound wife be on top. What happened? - It's those guys that jacked up the timing Benny not us. - But you guys have always been able to roll with it. You couldn't even take a shoulder check out there Lackey. This was okay today, but I can't have you guys screwing up any of my fetish matches. - Just give us through the weekend Benny. - Through the weekend, there's not enough time. You're not a wolverine, you can't just heal over the weekend. You gotta figure out some other way to pay me back. - You're not a fucking doctor Benny. - Hey, you fucking watch that shit. - Why don't we see if we can work it into some of our matches, give him some life agony. - You know what I like that idea, I like that. You come up with some good ideas and let me see 'em okay. We'll work 'em out next week if we can. But, you split my crowd again and that's it, okay. I'm gonna get my heart pressure, I'm sorry I yelled. - Thanks Ronnie. - She call? - I'm leaving Walt. - What? - I filed for divorce. - Why, you hardly see him. - Well thanks for the support. - No, it's just it changes everything. - I'm not trying to move in with you, you dick. I just thought that we could actually have a chance at a real relationship. - Superhero sheets Ronnie. - Okay, let's give it a shot. But I'm still gonna see other people. - Like hell you are. I swear Ronnie-- - Don't worry Tammy, he hasn't seen anyone else since he met you. - Shut up Jody, it's just knowing that I can if I want to. - Grow up Ronnie. - All right, you think you can tame the beast, have at it. But consider yourself forewarned. No one person's ever been able to handle all this sexual prowess. - I'll take my chances. - Hey everybody. - Hey. - How's your knee? - Getting better, did you get my messages. - Yeah, about that, can we take a walk or-- - That's a nice ring you got there. - Yeah, Trevor kind of proposed It kind of looks like you said yes. - I thought it was over. - Yeah, I really don't want to bore you guys with the particulars, can you-- - I don't want to have to re-explain it to everyone Michelle, please. - Okay, apparently you know when we broke up, he had a lot of time to realize the things he'd taken for granted. - Well he's still a douche though right? It doesn't explain why you said yes. - We have a lot of history. You know he's not all that bad. - You trying to convince us or yourself? - Georgie just let her finish. - This is horse shit. Just because you want to play it safe and be unhappy for the rest of your life doesn't mean I have to sit here and give you my blessing. - I wasn't asking you to. - Jody's a million times the man that Trevor is but you're never gonna know it because you're gonna be too busy picking out matching Mercedes and spitting out half asshole kids. - Ronnie! - I'm sorry that you feel that way Ronnie. I really did have the best time with you. I thought I was doing a good thing by coming over here and telling you in person. I'm sorry, I'm really sorry. - You okay son? - You know most people see someone like me and they misunderstand. Now I don't beg, I borrow. Whether it's in this life here or the one coming, I'll pay you back. Choices here, choices there. Who knows, maybe I'll be wearing your shoes right now. People used to listen to me. 37 years I built things with these hands, until I couldn't do it anymore. The pain is real. Sometimes pain wins boy. - My dad was a man of few words Bill. He might have been gay but he was tougher than any straight man I ever met. When he gave me this, he just said stones don't moan, keep it as a reminder of what you're gonna mean to this family. I mean I barely 20 years old and still getting in fights almost every night and here he is handing me a fucking rock. He never brought it up again though. I just assumed he meant be strong and don't bellyache like a little bitch. But after carrying this thing around with me for almost half my life, I noticed one day a couple of years ago, how smoother it got. Most of the rough and jagged edges were gone and it dawned on me, he knew exactly what he was doing. Son-of-a-bitch probably picked the damn thing up in a parking lot but he triggered something I obviously never knew was there. And when she came over, I just wanted to find a trigger like that you know. She was right there, right there in front of me and you know what I did? Nothing, I made I back from Afghanistan in one piece and I didn't do a goddamn thing. I just sat there with my thumb up my ass like some moron. Are you kidding me, just say something, anything, you idiot. No, not a fucking word. The thing is, I really don't care if we're serving ribs out of the backseat of our car, I really don't, I just want to settle down and have something to pass on to my kids some day you know. Maybe I wasn't good enough for her. I don't know, maybe, maybe I'm just so used to coming up short that I'm afraid to have something that can actually work for once. - The dog that chased the cat, hell every kitty is different 'til she ain't. The problem with this and this is this. You ain't dumb boy, you just think too much. Now, you gone put a dry rub on them ribs or you gonna slather 'em with sauce? - Both, it was good meeting you Bill. - And don't be a stranger, with that barbecue. You got it. - You boys need to come to me and my old lady's swingers party this weekend. This years theme is fantasy land, guaranteed to take your mind off of everything. - Yeah and I'm gonna be an erotic unicorn. You guys should come. Last year I hooked up with Vic's wife and well he tagged this little phillie I was with at the time. - Isn't that a little awkward? - No I was grateful. Every since she spit three kids out of that thing, it's like poking a baseball bat through an old truck tire. - I thought it was wonderful. - Hence the point of the party. - Let's get this over with okay, I just want to get it done and get home. - Hey Benny. Yo what? Come here, I want to talk to you a second. What do you want? What is it? Let's do this. - I'm sorry it's gonna be five more minutes. I'm trying to charge my phone. - This is bullshit, you're gonna make us wait. First you tell me I get to dress up like a cowboy, then I show up and you got me dressing like this. - You could have ran into the building on 9/11, you could have saved somebody. You want some of this orange. - Hey listen, you boys should definitely consider coming to this party. You'll get over old what's her pussy in no time at all, I promise you that. - Any signs of Hepatitis, HPV, anything like that? - It's me, I'm the guy who brought the HOV there, you kidding me? - Benny, I'm never sleeping with you again. - Well I got a bottle of rufies that says you will Casper. Yeah, you're right, let's go huh. You two, do something. It's all in how you carry yourself. You're a male nurse, but you're a male nurse. The tutors numbers are in on the fridge. And I left the list-- You think too much. Sometimes pain wins, sometimes pain wins boy. Don't forget to get enough eggs. - Don't worry Dad, we got it all right. This is great, what's that white stuff in there? It looks like bananas but it's like a white carrot or something, it's not potato. Is it potato? You need to snap out of it. All right I've never seen you like this. It's starting to freak me out. Bill was right. Hmm? - Just thoughts, I had so many thoughts swimming around in my head when she was here and I froze up like a freaking dummy. - She doesn't deserve your thoughts. All right, what we need to do is get you another woman and go to Vic's party. Tammy has this friend Becky, she can fit an entire cucumber-- - Ronnie, I don't think that's a good idea. - Horse shit, we go to this party and you'll forget about Michelle by the end of the week. - That's the thing Ronnie, I don't want to forget. - I don't get it, it's not like you have that much invested in her. - Maybe not, but I want to. - Then talk to her son. He who risks nothing gains nothing. - He's right I guess, you should at least go over there and just say your peace. That way, at least we can move on with our lives. If you're no gonna eat that give it to me. It's a rope right. - Hey, is Michelle here? Who's asking? - Jody. - Jody who? Jody Lackey, she actually worked with my brother and sister. You know what never mind. - No, no, no, you know what hold on, come in. Hey everybody, this is Jody, he's from one of Michelle's underprivileged families. - Yeah no. - You know with what they pay you, you really shouldn't bring your work home with you honey. I'm just playing man. - Can we talk for a minute? - That's a little rude don't you think? First you fuck my fiance, then you come over to my house. You embarrass me in front of my friends. What do you think, she's not gonna tell me. We cleaned the slate when we got back together. - Trevor. - No, no, no, if he wants to say something, just say it in front of my face. I think that's fair, considering, don't you handsome? - I'm sorry everyone, I made mistake, I shouldn't have came over here, I'm sorry. - Man for such a big guy, you sure are a pussy. Trevor. - You think you're gonna waltz into my house, steal my woman from me? Man you're not too bright are you? - Knock it off - I'm bright enough to see you're not the right guy for her. - Oh and you are? - I don't know. - Then what the hell are you doing here. - I'm not sure, but the one thing I do know is, my life's about the people around me Michelle and I really like having you around. I just, I don't get this. You didn't settle for your career, so why would you know with him? I know this is all new and unknown, I'm not saying I love you yet, but I can already think of at least, I don't know probably 19 different ways I already could. That was the best night I had in maybe five years. It seems like you might have felt the same way. It just sucks we can't do it again, that's all. - That's it sweetheart? I mean that's all you got. - Christ, now I can see why you broke up with this guy. - We love each other, asshole. - The problem is, you need to like someone to grow old with them Trevor. And from what I see, nobody likes you. - You know what, get out of my house. - Stop it knock it off. - Don't push me. - I'm serious. - Easy man. - Trevor that's enough, just stop it, knock it off. - I'm not gonna fight you man. Stop fighting, Jesus Christ. Stop it, Trevor stop it. Stop it, Trevor. Oh my god Trevor, that's enough. - Listen to me. Oh my God, what the hell was that. Look what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to prove to you that I'm working on the things I need to change, what about him? - I don't have to change pal, she said yes all right. So get the fuck outta my house. I've got a gun, I will use it. - Stop, Trevor. - You want some of that. - Shut up! Jody I think you should go. - For you to throw into the Trevi Fountain when you get to Rome. One for you and one for Lester. - Thank you Jacob. Remember less thumbs and more conversation when I'm gone, capisce? All right, all right. Don't worry Daddy Calvin, I'll keep these hooligans in line. Oh, I'm counting on that Georgie. - Go, now. - All right. Westin. - Ronnie. - You know we've been butting heads a lot lately. More than normal. - It's not my fault. - I know, and I'm sorry. - I had to do my laundry the other day, after I kicked your ass, and I noticed there's some blood stain on my favorite t-shirt. And I thought I had spot cleaned everything but it had already gone through the drawer, so at that point what can you do, it's in there permanently right forever. - You should give it to Tammy, she's great with stains. - That's not what I'm trying to say. Ronnie, you know it may be bloody and it may be ugly, but I still love that stupid t-shirt. I still love that stupid t-shirt. We all have our stains right? It's just the way it is. I can accept that, don't you ever question my loyalty to this family again, you hear me? - Yeah. - That's not a bomb is it? - No. They're dice, valve stem covers for your wheelchair tires. Because you're gonna be the World Poker Champion and all some day. - You do realize we don't use dice in poker right? - Yeah I know, they didn't have Texas Hold 'Em, or card, you know forget it, it's all right. I'll take 'em. - No, no, no. Thank you, a pair of dice huh? - Damn old man, you and your damn tears. I gotta say, you guys are right, to his shit works. I think it's even making my dick bigger - Girth or length. - Girth. - Hey we should measure it. - Come on you big babies, get out there in the ring. Vince and Taylor are waiting on you. I tell you what, you sure can take a beating like that. Both of you, the crowd love you tonight, it was great, it was perfect. - You should have made us heroes a long time ago Benny. - You all right? - Yeah my neck, I hurt it last night at Vic's party. You should have seen it, you should have seen it. So I switched wives with Casper and he got all over my huge fat wife, he must be going through a fatty thing. The way he was going at my wife, it was epic. Shit, what the hell's going on out there. All right, hey great job. - You still wish we would have went? - Yeah kind of. Hey guys, can I get three pulled pork please. Order up. - Georgie, how 'bout we put you in roller skates and you skate around handing people food. Georgie gets to drive the truck tonight since Jacob didn't show up. - Can I get one more with no greens please. - No greens, no greens. - Thank you. - Oh excuse me, think I could trade this for a pulled pork sandwich and another date? Hi Michelle. - Hey everyone. I hope you washed it. - Ronnie. - The way he sweats it's probably ruined. - It's clean Ronnie. - He's dating someone else now. - Oh, is that true? - No. - But he could be. - Well can I say, you were right Jody. The man licked his shoe for you Michelle. - I know. - Then he came home and drank a full thing of hand sanitizer and threw up all over my pillow. - You're a good brother Ronnie. I'm sorry. - Don't hurt my brother again Michelle. - I won't. Just because I was born on a truck stop floor, doesn't mean I had to stay there. Sure we've seen some shit. - Hi. - Hey. Once you find a reason bigger than yourself, it's pretty hard to ignore it. - Like the outfit. Oh yeah. - Especially, yeah, cute. You look good. I definitely don't have all the answers. - Can we start over? - But sometimes, I guess so. Pain doesn't have to win. Jody Lackey. - Michelle Ryan. - That's a nice handshake you got there. You like barbecue Michelle Ryan? - I love it. Do you like to sit when you pee? - Really? Out of everything you could have brought up, that's the one thing you want to talk about? - It just keeps replaying in my mind, I'm sorry. - Can we maybe go on one more date before I explain? - I think I can handle that. - Yeah? Yeah. - So, where'd you find my shirt? Promise not to get mad? Of course. I hid it, 'cause I wanted to sleep with it. That's one of the most adorable things I've ever heard. Really? Yeah. I mean, you're a bit of a thief and a liar, but it's still really adorable. My team. Ah, you son of a. - Ah. Fuck! Tiny I said-- I hit him really hard on accident. - I can't because I'm gonna be going straight to search, I'm gonna punch you in the face. - My sperm is so strong it wears a cape. - Scouts honor, which me luck. - You basically could, ugh. - Hmm. - Dad! Start the fuck over. Where are we? I'll catch him, now that I know he's in a. - I can't help it. - We meant go and polish a few knobs, trying to whisper 'cause the damn dog. Pretty dog, who brought their dog to work? No, no, no, he's just curious. - Horse shit, the only way we can wear one those. Hey, hey, hey! Horse shit, the only way we. We meant go on a European vacation. Shit dog. We meant. - Don't cradle the back of my head like that, it feels like you're gonna pull me in your dick. One more time like. I won't. - Yeah we're gonna do the video but it's got to be in late afternoon, cuz I've got to have an anal cyst lanced. This things about 10:30. I just wanted to say that. - Get out my ass. Whoo, get outta there. Wow, now get the fuck outta my, our house okay. Before I grab my nine and put two in your chest, how 'bout that? - Jody enough!

All right here we go, we're still rolling. - Embarrassed, you pop that thing up for the cashier to take a glance at. It ain't nothing to be embarrassed of. - He's right, no he's not right, what am I saying, he's not right. Can we just start where I'm in? That's what fires them up. - Keep that thing covered up. - He's right Jacob. - This is him man, I'm sorry guys. I won't laugh again, I swear. - Right Jacob. Okay ready. He's right Jacob, unless you're ready to have a kid, don't look at me. But you can look out there. - I'm looking away from you. - That's like Ray Charles. - It hurts my tank, even thinking about that, are you kidding me? Enough of the tank, I told you, my tank has such bad nerves in it, I can sit on a fucking light bulb and I wouldn't feel it. That thing will pop out in between my legs, I wouldn't even know. - Are you serious, could you? Douche bags.
