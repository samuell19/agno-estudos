Come on! Don't keep the Sisters waiting. This is Frey. She's new here as well. Can you read? It's a giraffe. They were from Africa. - You can read? - Yes. Max, have you been stealing things again? It breaks my heart. Why do you do this? So you can save up? One day buy a ticket up to that place? That place is not for you, or for me. But it's not fair, Sister. Why can't I go there? Sometimes in life we don't understand... ...why things are the way they are. But I know one thing. I know you are special. You will do something very important one day. Something you were born for. My little Max. Off to work, huh? Gotta get up early to work that line. Make the world a better place. I can finally buy my ticket to Elysium. Leave me alone! Burn her ID! Yes, I understand... My, how you've grown! Are the children here? Yes, with Dominica. I have a present for you. Go and get it with your mother. It's next to the couch. Only one made it. Hey. You're holding up the line. They started the fight, Sister. I just want to live there. You see how beautiful it looks to us from here? Yes. Well... Now look how beautiful we look from there. Keep it. This is yours now. To never forget about where you come from. You have work to do, Mr. Carlyle. He's awake! I'm shitting my pants. Everyone has one special thing, Max. One thing that they are destined to do. One thing they were born for. Hey, chiquita. Hey. You see how beautiful it looks to us from here? Now look how beautiful we look from there. This is yours now. To never forget about where you come from. My little Max.
