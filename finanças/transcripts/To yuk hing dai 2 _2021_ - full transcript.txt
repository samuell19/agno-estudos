There was once four people who broke out of prison for different reasons against all odds, they fought through and succeeded with determination the first one donated his kidney and saved his mom's life the second watched his daughter get married and reconciliated with his wife and daughter there's another one who tagged along but he was too much of an ass so he was only able to get through one gate the last one, he didn't break out but he masterminded the whole thing so he also had his sentence increased the four of us were brought back to prison but we made it out once so everybody was impressed nowadays, they'd call the four of us breakout brothers add this and mix it up you'll have enough to paint it on let's forget about breaking out again spending my time working out - "chen ho ching," - studying, so I can be an intellectual - "sentence: Expiring soon" - studying, so I can be an intellectual I forgot to tell you guys, I'm outta here soon tin, how do you read this? Turn it over you're kidding right? Turn the other way oh right - that's it "mak kin tin" - don't misunderstand, I didn't become the boss- - don't misunderstand, I didn't become the boss "five years" - don't misunderstand, I didn't become the boss the prison is getting renovated and I know a little something about architecture so the warden appointed me to fix up the recreation room the real boss, is still the same guy although I'm still the boss I just wanna learn more skills "big roller, thirty years" - so I can contribute at home when I'm released count me out of fights and all that luckily the prison is somewhat peaceful nowadays Shoot! Shoot! Remember warden tang? Because of our escape caused him severe negligence and he lost the chance to be promoted so he's still here as the warden trapped in here with us you have just attacked an officer one more month in your sentence we're screwed, change the subject why didn't you shoot?

Nothing special what about scar? He's obeying the rules is there any useful information? Sir, report I eavesdropped on big roller his daughter is having a baby they don't know the sex yet but I guess that's good news in this prison how is that any of my business?

Cut to the chase, warden ho chun is only here for three months I don't want anyone to touch him you're talking about that idiot? He ordered someone from the outside to beat up my guy and he's hurt really bad as his boss how can I not set this score even? If you touch him, I'll screw you all you can do is add time to my sentence how much can you add? I'm here for life anyway be more creative, will you? I can stick you in solitary for a few years until you go insane it's your call Thank you sir, I'll do it myself Just tell ho chun to stay out of trouble otherwise nobody else can help him if he can't control himself, then you control him if anything happens during this period it's on you if you can't control him, how can I do it? If there's any trouble, I'm going by the book get them out of here This is the library it's quite small, but it has everything the tough guys don't come here because they can't read so it's relatively quiet and safe here this is little b, he's been here 30 years he takes good care of this place hello, hello little b, bring out the 'secret stash' for Mr. Ho okay this one here reading more can soothe the soul Help yourself It's alright, but you draw them too stiff it needs to be softer yeah control the pen with flexibility Get a few men and guard the door, don't let him get away yes, scar Where are you going?

With your clout, you can only take one my clout isn't given to me by others I've earned it myself I can take as many as I want are you sure? I have you outnumbered for sure to anyone who'd like to work for me I'll give them $20k per month you have 48 hours to decide and you only have 8 hours left Chicken breast please next! Next! Kim you left your orange sorry boss, I'm just thinking of my family let's eat there's 400 people in this prison $20k per person each month that's more than $20million in less than three months right, he's gonna go bankrupt you're still here? Why don't you go over to ho chun? It's like the stock market when the whole market goes one way, it'll crash when everyone's flocking to ho chun I have faith in you, big roller thank you, but I'm just eating scraps here here's another chicken leg, interested? It's free, of course I'll take it I'd be stupid not to, right? You're the stupid one, bones are the best chicken bone is full of protein really? At least it has a backbone right? Enjoy thank you Trying to monopolize within your first week you planning on staying here long? It's just three months insurance I promise you won't be affected everything in here could affect me Warden tang, is there something you'd like to say to me? Not me, someone else wants to talk to you warden tang, the two police officers are here ho chun, let me tell you the victim who fell because of your finance company's debt collection he died last night we will change your charge from incitement of assault to incitement of murder incitement of murder? Are you kidding me? I've told you before my finance company is a fully licensed operation I asked my staff to collect debt but the way they did it was their own choosing now you're charging me with incitement of murder but that doesn't change the truth you're wealthy, maybe someone will take the fall you could clear your name easily but that's a thing of the past people outside know you're in deep shit and they don't wanna get dragged into it they're cutting ties with you there are three witnesses this morning who were willing to testify against you so I'm just here to give you a friendly warning to stop wasting each other's time and see that justice is done for the victim if you plead guilty, we'll try to bargain with the judge otherwise, you'll be here for life due to the severity of the case DOJ is expediting this case the judge will rule in 20 days take your time and think about it thank you, warden tang glad that law enforcement agencies are working together please see the two officers out $20k per person each month you can handle this for a few months but if you get convicted for murder can you still afford this so-called insurance? Big roller, sorry about this Have a seat if you think $20k per month is too little then I'll give you $5 million each in one go what do you mean? $5 million to watch you shower? I want you to break me out of prison no way you guys succeeded last time it means you have the capability but because we escaped last time they amped up security we can't do it again the security is not seamless even if you do escape they'll get you back in here I'd be out of the country, free and at peace Mr. Ho, I'm out in a few days I can also be free and at peace dumb-ass you won't be able to earn $5 million in your whole lifetime with money, you're a good son if not, then you're just a disaster listen to me, young man let me give you some advice even if you do break out and leave Hong Kong you'll be living your life looking over your shoulder you can't buy your dignity do you understand?

Can he come in and out on demand? Sorry, sir but he looked really agitated I thought it was a serious matter, so... Let him in warden, I'd like to make a phone call you've been here long enough you know the rules write down the purpose of your call, and to whom then apply through the welfare officer someone is trying to kill my wife and daughter they're in danger do you have evidence? If you do, I'll call the police after their investigation they'll receive the protection they need it'll be too late by then, lives are at stake I'm begging you to let me have a phone call I just wanna call them and tell them to lay low please - sure Fill in this form and apply What will you lose by giving me the phone call? I'm not at any loss but that's against the rules calm down... Calm down... Are you cold-blooded? Calm down lives are at stake big roller is out of control take him to solitary come on let go, I can walk by myself Big roller is in solitary and you'll be released in a few days I'm all by myself how can I handle ho chun? While he's in here he's best at targeting family members you don't have any family, what are you afraid of? He's insane, asking me to break him out of prison I'm being released in a few days but big roller's family is in danger I've thought about it, once I get out I'll find his wife and take her somewhere safe until that idiot is sentenced you'll have to hang in here on your own look alive bed checks again? Hey! What are you doing? Trying to throw it away? Everyone is watch, it won't make a difference As long as you get more time in your sentence you'll focus on breaking me out of here you idiot Bed checks, everybody squat down If you want to succeed ho ching needs to get out of here safe and sound Hurry up You guys have a lot to talk about? Get up Tell me, what were you guys talking about? Come here Pick it up this isn't mine you're holding it, and it isn't yours? Could it be mine then? It really isn't mine then tell me whose is it sir, this bag is mine Take him away. Yes, sir give it to me let's go I think I have a way out but I have to check the infirmary First bed hurry up blood pressure is normal, and no fever dizziness could be caused by imbalance of fluid in your ear stay here overnight you should be good to go tomorrow alright, thank you, doctor doc, it's Wednesday, do you want it? You are so amazing, of course I do if you want it, then get me better food don't worry, I won the tierce last time if I win again, I'll treat you to a feast I'll take your word for it, if your horses win tonight... What has that idiot ho chun been up to? When I get better, I'm gonna settle the score that traitor's gonna have a streak of bad luck but in any case, thanks for saving me last time you guys have integrity I can distinguish between my grievances so I'll repay my debt to you when you're in trouble just say my name and I'll protect you when are you getting discharged? I could've left a while ago but the warden was afraid I'd take revenge so he's sticking me here for now there's something you can help me with bro, make it straight you're making it horizontal, come on man big roller, just keep your temper in check let me know if you need anything big roller, thank god you're back they're waiting for you inside the boss is back Big roller glad to be working together tin is a genius, he figured it out we can make it out... What right do you have to decide for me? He's holding your wife and daughter hostage what if something happened to them? My wife and daughter are my concern it's none of yours! I'm responsible for them we're brothers we'd help even if you didn't ask for it what 'brothers'? We're just brothers in here but we're nothing out there stop pretending as brothers, we won't leave even if you beat us exactly, safety of your family is the priority let's make it out again are you guys done? Stop wasting my time Tell me the plan the plan will revolve around these four words ensuring external medical attention in prison, if you're injured or feeling unewll you'd be sent to the infirmary but if it's something more serious and the infirmary cannot handle it they'll arrange an ambulance and send you to the nearest hospital of course, if you're already half dead then it's a waste of time trying to break out that's right so the safest way is to render the infirmary useless the best way is to cut the power there is only one power outlet in the infirmary I will make a conductor out of two nails plug it into the socket and that will divert the current from neutral to live according to ohm's law, I = v/r the smaller the resistance, the larger the current that'll completely fry the circuit board and cause a power outage what's up with all the English I'll repeat it again in cantonese plug in the nails, cause a power outage, done wait they have backup power at the infirmary to ensure everything is operational so our second mission is to cut the backup power when I was renovating the recreation room I've seen the prison floor plans the wires for the backup power are underground and just so happens to pass by this rom We need to dig a hole here and cut the backup power then the infirmary won't be operational once the ambulance arrives we'd be rightfully sent out of prison once we're out, we'll let ho ching arrange the details don't worry, car jacking and driving I'm good at those things one more thing, I've asked scar for help scar? What can he help us with? He's being held in the infirmary he'll be the one to plug it in for us but this idiot caused the shit that scar is in right now why would the idiot scar help this idiot? Who are you calling idiot? I apologize that idiot has already agreed I don't care who you find for help but I'm not going alone whoever takes part in this must go with me who knows if guys point me to the wrong direction then I'm screwed if you wanna hurry up, then you better start working you can sit on your ass just because you're paying? I'm being released tomorrow, still healthy and sound this has been my motto peace peace piece, peace, don't get it wrong done, bro ching very good thank you ming, you have a bad gut you're shitting yourself all the time take my toilet paper boss, I want some too - come, take it - thank you, boss take it - thank you, boss I'll keep this safe for you until you come back soon shut up! I want some too here, take it Sir, have a cigarette enjoy that cigarette goodbye, sir the backup power cable should be within this area we just need to dig three inches officer chan don't let me see you in there again don't worry, I'm sure I won't be back Oh no! Where's the cable? But we've dug so deep this would be deeper than where they've laid the cables did you read the floor plan wrongly? Was it the wrong area? I should be right, but we can try I need to go to court in three days there's no time to try you're full of ideas, think of something don't think that you can get out of it by dragging this on let me tell you, if I don't get out then your wife and daughter are screwed Sorry warden, I'll pick it up out of my way Not much work today, warden? It's very dusty in there, don't go in there's a lot of... Warden what are you doing here? Nothing, just renovating the recreation room painting, sawing wood we're all chipping in Remove the tarp Apologies, it's very dusty I was afraid I'd scratch the floor, so I put a tarp on We couldn't find the cable, so we can't cut the power so we'll have to handle the doctor the infirmary can't operate without power but it's also useless without a doctor the doctor is an external hire so he's less sensitive to danger we'll handle him we have to do it tomorrow because tomorrow is Wednesday night what about Wednesday? Every Wednesday, scar and the doctor would bet on horseracing so in order for the doctor and ourselves to be sent out we have to be in a serious condition that's realistic but we can't actually be sick so we'll have to use magnesium oxide can you dumb it down for me? Magnesium oxide will cause diarrhea and magnesium oxide is a very common ingredient in medicine so it's poisonous, but it's not poison most importantly, it can be found in the kitchen door the material within the door is magnesium oxide How much longer do you need? We're standing ducks here I have to pry open the wooden board first Lemme make a sandwich Big roller, ho chun officer chickenshit I'll do it myself help yourself alright It's Wednesday, we have to get it done otherwise we can't go anywhere making a sandwich wouldn't take long I don't care, just make a move I've had enough of you what's going on? Calm down! Calm down! I'm just here for a sandwich, why did a fight break out? Who's the boss here? Stop fighting stop! Stop! Stop it, stop fighting Stop fighting... stop fighting... calm down sir, you better send them to the infirmary stop it, calm down you three, come with me to the infirmary hurry up then I just wanted to have a sandwich calm down How's it going? Hanging in there? It' just a measly scar all the bosses are here together please take your time I'll shut the door for you there's been a change of plan I'm in charge here I don't care how powerful you are outside I just know that you can't succeed without me so I should be fairly compensated, right? If you have the ability, I'll pay up $6 million $6 million... Let me offer you a discount not counting my arm just this scar and the emotional hardships from being betrayed it should be with $10 million Deal, lets make it $10 million let's talk about the plan not yet pay up first they trust you, but I don't what if you don't pay up after you've escaped? Wouldn't I be the dumb-ass? Aren't you a dumb-ass already by being here for life? Can you guys stop this nonsense? Listen to big roller, and stop fighting Dr. Chan, you're in so late yes, scar's condition has worsened his wound is infected, and I have to tend to it you're a kind soul, thank you for your work Doctor don't worry... Let me introduce to you this is Dr. Chan, he's in charge of the infirmary these are my brothers Dr. Chan - hello, Dr. Chan I've asked them to join me in cheering you on let's win big tonight I've brought red wine to celebrate I know this wine, it's good stuff then we need to let the wine breathe sure, let me do it shit, I forgot the bottle opener - my men will take care of it - yeah, I'll handle it thank you Doctor, let's have a toast no way, we can only drink if I've won otherwise it's unlucky First race, #1 'fortune star' won and then it's #6 'kung hei fat choi' followed by #4 'lucky strike' on 3rd fan favorite #3 'sprinting devil' is on 4th place we see #6 and #9 sprinting forward these two horses are riding against each other going way ahead of the other horses it's between #6 and #9 final stretch, #6 'Hercules' and #9 'all's well ends well' are still ahead final 50 meters, they're giving it their all is it gonna be #6 or #9? This is it! #6 'Hercules' has won by a horsehair big roller, we bet on ♪9 what are you chanting #6 for? It's my fault, my sincere apologies Dr. Chan I'll drink to that drink my ass There's been a change, it has been ruled that 6 'Hercules' was obstructing #9's track therefore #6 is disqualified and #9 'all's well ends well' will take first place what a roller coaster ride you made a good call I'll drink to that that's enough Cheers - Doctor, are you okay? - I'm not there's no more wine let's drink again next time we'll slaughter them all again next time alright - sure win! - Keep it up goodbye, doctor didn't you say it was gonna be instant diarrhea? Maybe the dosage wasn't enough haven't you tried it before? How could I, idiot? Do you have stomach pain? I do I do too doctor, my stomach also hurts acute stomach pain, shortness of breath those are symptoms of food poisoning sorry, it's my fault it must be the cheap wine that caused this Comein warden, ho chun, big roller, scar and tin and Dr. Chan all have food poisoning Dr. Chan also has it? Follow procedure and call an ambulance when the incident happened the cctv was turned to face the wall I think there's something more to this cctv's malfunction all the time it's their right to be sent to the hospital I strongly suggest that we investigate into this I don't want to have a life in our hands but this is too much of a coincidence are you the warden here? No, sir are you gonna take responsibility? No, sir do you have any further questions? No, sir call an ambulance now and take them to the hospital yes, sir Chickenshit, you go with them what? Me? Keep an eye on them yes, sir Don't close the door warden, I've got a bad feeling about this I request that I escort the prisoners there are hundreds of inmates in there you're leaving your post because of these four?
