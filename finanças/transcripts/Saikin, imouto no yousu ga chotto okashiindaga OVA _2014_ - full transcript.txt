Onii-chan! Wait! Onii-chan! {OP} {part A} Um... I'm sorry.{/Excuse me.} I hope I'm not bothering you... I... really... Um, would like to... Um... Huh? Moa-chan? What're you doing? Huh? What? What? What's it? What's up? Hey! I get it! She did something to you! Ah, let me apologize. She's an idiot. Hey, stop it! Go that way! What's it? What did you do? No, she didn't do anything. Huh? Who are you anyway? Huh? Me? I'm her older brother, Torii Shoutarou. I can't believe it! How could you choose to go home this way?! You never go this way! Yuuya wanted to buy cakes in the café. Sheesh, can't I even choose the way I'm going home? But just how bad are you at reading the mood?! I figured that guy was mad at you. You couldn't be any more wrong! That's right. Shimazu-san is a college student working at a café as a part-time job. Welcome. A table for two? Yes, please. Please allow me to guide you to your seats. That lovely smile and gentlemanly behavior... I was completely captivated! I went to the café {frequently }as soon as I got my pocket money. He even remembered my name. And I finally, finally took my courage today... to invite him to the movies. And yet... And yet... You got those tickets from the lottery in the neighborhood anyway. Like, what's your problem? You haven't lost anything. You're missing the point! There's no way a college student would go out with a little kid like you anyway. I'm not a little kid! And Shimazu-san isn't like that! Hah! You really are a little kid! You're wearing panties with a chick on it, after all. Huh? I don't even wear that anymore. Oh, really? What're you doing, you baldie?! I'm not bald! I hope you're going to be! Not happening! It sure isn't a chick. Stop it! What's wrong, bear-panties girl? Bear-panties girl! What're you doing? Let go already! Hey, don't you think you're going a little overboard? I feel bad for Moa-chan. Stupid Onii! Stupid baldie! Shiny bald! I'm not... bald... What's with up with that “Shimazu-san isn't like that”? Everyone's the same! She can't judge him just by his looks. But you know, he doesn't seem like a bad person. You're just judging him by his looks too! She knows nothing about what happens{/befalls her (negative nuance)} if she goes out with a college student! She'd be asking for trouble. You sure worry a lot. Huh?! What do you mean when you say “worrying”?! Never mind. Look at this. Shimazu-san sent me the okay. Oh boy, what should I wear? Yuuya, you are free on Sunday, aren't you? Mhm. Mommy, I wanna eat popcorn! {idk if you can represent the mispronunciations of a child (I can't) -- sorry to disappoint, but neither can I} What flavor would you like? Caramel. Morning, Moa-chan. Good morning! Did I keep you waiting? N-No, not at all. Wow, he really came. That gentle freak! He gotta be a lolicon! A lolicon! Hey, was it really necessarry for me to come? Two is better than one if something happens, right? You're just assuming something will happen, though. {Yessir!}{[insert sarcastic turtle noise here]} Let's go. No matter how much BPO will be mad at me, I want to hug you. I'm glad. I wish this happiness could continue forever. Even if one of us dies, love is eternal. That was great. Yup. I cried myself dry. It was such a nice story. Don't you think those two at the end were moving? Definitely. Hold on for a moment. So you're a crybaby, right Moa-chan? Ah, um, I'm all right. Thank you. What're they doing?! Is this even normal?! Well, this story really was a tear-jerker. Ow! I'd like you to come with me somewhere. Sure. With pleasure. Thanks. Shimazu-san. This way, this way! See? They're all right. They seem to be enjoying themselves. Wait! Hold up... Are you kidding me? Why on good God's green earth are they going there?! Maybe they're going to the toilet? Bullshit!{Precision F-Strike} Listen, if a couple goes to a hotel... {"couples" not said explicitly} Stop it! Help! Onii... chan! Moa! That fool! Moa! Huh? Onii? Why are you... Wh-What is it? Were you following us? O-Of course not! I just happened to see you come here as I was walking with Yuuya! And what if we come here?! No what-if's! You're a middle schooler! Could you hold on for a moment? Even if you're her older brother, taking her home without listening to what she has to say is too rash. It's not like I came to interfere. She's a little kid. She even has bear-panties. She's just a little kid with no sex appeal whatsoever. Hey! So, could you refrain from doing something like this? My little sister is just a kid from middle school. That's a relief. You have a good brother, Moa-chan. Huh? Don't worry; we didn't come here for the kind of thing you're thinking of. The reason we came here... is this. Huh? A café in the hotel? Ah, the cakes in this café are famous. That's right! What's wrong with that?! Uh... Well, if a couple goes to a hotel... {"couple" not said explicitly} While we're at it... I think you're misunderstanding something. I'm a girl. {mfw: WHAT THE FUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUUCK} Whaaaaaaaaaat?! Onii, quiet down! Oh, I'm so sorry! I truly am! Don't worry. Shimazu-san is famous of being a beautiful woman in man clothes in that café, and yet... I know right. I thought you knew. Unbelievable. Causing such a commotion... But he was full of worry. Was he? Yeah. Honestly, my opinion of him has improved. He has a foul mouth, we're fighting every day, but he worries just as much as back then. Nobody would know that better than me. Uh, so she's a woman older than us. We could start something now. I could have an adult romance. Just get bald already. Bald?! How is that related at all?! Moa! {title} The illumination before the Misakura Station has been lit up again this year. Everyone in the city is in the fever of Christmas. It feels like it's finally the end of the year. {how much I'm awaiting that!} And here in the front of the station... Mitsuki, Kyouko-san sent a mail. Did you read it? I saw it just now. ...all Christmas cakes are sold out. Christmas is coming up. So I thought, let's have a Christmas party! A Christmas party? Exactly! Let's enthusiastically share our cakes and other sweets at the end of the year! I'm all right with that. I don't really have any plans anyway. Huh? You seriously have no plans, Yukina-san? Count me in! You scared me! What're you doing, Torii-senpai? Having lunch, obviously. Let us join in on that party! Well... I'm fine with Neko-senpai, but this was supposed to be a girls-only holy night. Come on, what the problem? The more, the merrier! It's okay, really. A place that's perfect for five people... She hasn't been in a good mood lately. Is she tired from the supplementary lessons?{check plot} Or is she sulking because she couldn't see the lights? Either way, she's venting her anger. Well then, the place where we're meeting up is set. Right, Yuuya? Huh? Geez, I can't believe it! We had a plan to finally be all alone with Onii-chan on the Eve, and now... Why do they have to make a commotion at our place? Probably because our place is perfect for making a commotion. But, but! Christmas Eve is supposed to be like... Watching the illumination with Onii-chan, and having a dinner just the two of you. The sweet-and-painful maddening night taking a visit. And exchanging passionate vows. And now, everything is..! Why would I need to be so flustered? We'll have classes tomorrow anyway, so the party will probably finish before it'd get too late. Mitsuki! You're actually quite enthusiastic about the lovey-dovey plan on Christmas, aren't you? Huh? All right, we're betting it all on today! Nope! No need to bet anything. I'm not in that mood... anyway. Hey, what's with that gloomy look? The chastity belt couldn't possibly be in a serious state again, could it?! Huh? Nothing wrong here. Don't just flip it like that! I do have times when I'm deeply in thought too. Hey, what's that costume anyway? Ayaka said she borrowed it from the girl{presumably} from the cosplay circle. There's so much to complain about. A costume party would be so much fun! I wonder what it's like. How did you do this in such a short time? Are you a wizard? None of them takes a lot of time to make. The cake is just a Swiss roll with cream on it. Man, I may have fallen in love with you if you were a girl. Nah, I'll pass. Right, where's Nanami-san? Still at work. She'll come home later. {check plot} Hi! Merry Christmas! Oh, beautiful! {hardest line in this ep} How nice! How nice! Ayaka-chan, Mitsuki-chan, you're both so cute! Who're you? A child? Shuddup, baldie! I'm not bald! Why're you the only snowman? Don't mind it. It's my policy not to show too much skin. That's a weird policy. Hey, don't you think it's too short? I wish I had put on something under here. Don't worry. Don't worry. It looks cute on you, Mitsuki. Ah, thanks. Why're you looking at me? Why? Because you're there. I'm barging in! Sorry I'm late. Their sizes're perfect for everyone too! Huh? Yukina-san, you didn't put it on? Um, I did put it on under my clothes, but... Ah, maybe it didn't suit you? There were problems in some parts. Ah, never mind that. Please let us see it by all means. Right, Yuuya? Yeah. I guess I'd like to see it, now that you put in the effort to put it on. Really? But you'll probably just laugh at me. Look, it's so tight. She's an angel! An angel fell down on the holy night! Santa-san, thanks for the lovely present you gave me! Yukina-san, you're as sexy as ever. How nice! How admirable! You're okay like that. There's nothing to hide there. Shut up! Well then. Merry Christmas! She's in a better mood. It's a good thing everyone came here. To be honest, I have no clue how I should deal with her when she's in that state. Yuuya, is there more? Yeah, yeah. I'll bring some. Hello. Kanzaki household. Ah hello. Yuuya-kun? Ah, Kyouko-san. Ah, we're having a Christmas party with our friends right now. Are you coming here at the end of the year? Oh, great! Ah, Mitsuki? I'll give it to her. Mitsuki, it's a call from Mom. Toilet. Um, sorry. It seems she can't really take the phone now. Ah, I guess she's mad at me, since I mailed her that I can't go home in the end. Well, it's because of her father{?}'s business. And he'll come home soon in the end. Well, you see, 21st of this month was her birthday. Mitsuki, may I come in? I'm coming in. Hey, don't just open it{ without my permission}. Your father and Kyouko-san are coming home on the 30th. I heard your birthday was on the 21st. I didn't know. I don't really need to bother to tell you. No matter how you look at it, she's probably sulking about her birthday. It's a little belated, but happy birthday. Is there something you'd like as a present? A present?! Hooray! Then... I want you. I want you personally as a present. Hey, Hiyori! What're you saying?! All right. But I'm... not so good. Here I go. Come, Onii-chan. Happy Birthday! Happy... Happy! Happy Birthday! What's this ultra strange mysterious sound? Incantation, even. Ah, this? It's probably Yuu-kun singing. How does this still qualify as singing? I thought it was a Buddhist recital. Interesting. I just can't recall the lyrics when I haven't been singing for a while. All right, one more time. Happy birthday, Mitsuki! Yuuya! Are you trying to summon demons for the holy night?! I'm home! Are you all gung-ho? Mitsuki-chan, Nee-san sent a package. Once again, cheers! {they never said it on-screen this ep} All right, time to drink! Did you have no plans for the Eve? Ayaka-chan. Don't ever ask an adult woman about that. Open it. Mitsuki, happy 16th birthday. Tasty! One more cup! Aren't you drinking too much? I want one more too. Wait no, I want one more!
