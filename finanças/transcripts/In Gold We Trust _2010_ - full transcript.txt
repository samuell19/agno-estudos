Go on, kiss the baby for us. Kiss your wife. Go ahead, Lionel. Any news? I spoke to Remi. We have to act fast before the gold leaves Guyana. Canadian Gold's 3 sending it to Switzerland. OK, I'm on my way to delivery gas to them. They have no idea. You get the others. I'll call from Cayenne. Roger. That was Virgil to know if we needed gas. I said he's too dear. Tell him to stop working with illegals. He'll get caught. Gentlemen... Hi, Roger. - How are things? - OK, you? Thanks. - Beer? - You bet. You're late. You can still pay up. Pay him for his 3 barrels of gas. They're here. In Gold We Trust - Hi, Maurice. - Hi. The equipment's here. Thank you. I'll pick it up later. I'm not asking any questions. I should hope not, at that price! Enjoy your meal. Gotta wait for the gas. The cops are onto me. I'm quitting, anyway. I'm retiring. We're not going into the jungle, I hope. Good to see you. Hear about Miguel? 3 months after Zimbabwe, he shot himself. All by himself! Scared you'll be next? I quit. I got a restaurant now. It's in the South of France. Look. Business is booming. That's why you're here! I get bored when I stay still. I won't spend my life serving seafood! Is Lionel still around? Looking for gold. How is he? Married. But he's in. Couldn't you find anyone else? No-one as efficient. OK, pal? YOU met? Let's go. Where'd you come from? Caracas. What's wrong with planes? I'm not in a hurry. Why don't you tell us your plan? 600 kilos of gold. It's virtually a good deed, because Canadian Gold doesn't just mine gold. It also recycles the garimperios gold. It buys it for 13,000 euros a kilo in the jungle and sells it for 20,000 in Switzerland. The illegals' money launderer! The mine's 30 minutes from the Brazilian border by chopper. I first wanted to hit them at the airport in Cayenne, but the police would've got us in no time. Now we'll be in Rio before they realize. The main quality of gold is, it isn't traceable once it's been melted down. 2 hours after we get the gold, we'll have the paperwork and can dance a samba... With 120 kilos each. What about the equipment? It's being dealt with. How many people? With Lionel, 5. 120 kilos of gold, what's that worth? Just over 2 million euros. Each! Good wine! Virgil to Lionel come in, Lionel. Roger. We're all here except you. I got something to do first, but don't worry, I'm coming. Listen...... You're going to Paris tomorrow. Wait for my call. She mustn't work. How many times must I tell you? She's pregnant. Beat it! NO, Camille! Camille! What do you want? To say goodbye. I'm sorry. Canadian Gold offers better guarantees. We applied first. How can you work such a big area? I'll find a way. The police say that last month, you took an injured illegal to the hospital. A 15-year-old kid. He had a broken arm. He came to us, asking for help. What should I have done? Let it go gangrenous? You're suspected of fraternizing with illegals. What? Are you shitting me? They just killed my husband. I have no choice but to cancel your permit. In the circumstances... I'm sorry. You're stealing my concession. I know it's hard for you. But please watch what you say. Do you realize what you're doing? I'm up to my neck in debt. It's all I had left. Maybe I could get you a job at city hall. That's all very well, but the gold won't wait. And the guy who got the equipment? Maurice? I don't think so. He has too much to lose. I can get you a pro within 48 hours if I make a few phone calls. We can't wait that long. They move the gold in the next 3 days. They've already moved the rest. Gotta do it sooner. Or we forget it. We'll never get a chance like it. I'll replace Lionel. Why are you here? Canadian Gold stole our concession. They got the garimpeiros to attack us. Hey, Virgil, what's going on? Who is this? Lionel's wife. She gets his share. Shut up! There's 5 of us now. Aren't you on vacation? I took a day off. I had a date. Was she pretty? - Tell us. - Later. You're here, take it. It ain't the South of France! Why did you hole up there, anyway? I wanted to buy a hotel in Morocco, but that's too gay! Well, right now you're supposed to be a Swiss banker. Thanks. Beer? 2. What're you doing here? I've come to do business. I brought you a buyer. How'd you like to make some money? Shoot How are things? Whenever I supply gas, I take a load back. Wanna buy my gold? It's safer and costs less in transport. I bet I can make you a better deal. Maybe I already have a better deal! This is Mr Ziegler who came here in person to make you an offer. - Where you from? - Zurich. I already do a lot of business in Brazil. How much will you pay? Well, the official rate. My gold isn't. It could be. That's my job. What quantity? As much as you can get. I should ask you that. Why should I trust you? 'Cause you know me. They're here. Be back on Tuesday with gas. Think it over in the meantime. Interested in gold now? I want to be rich. You're not cut out for it. You just want the thrill. Why do I work with you? Don't turn around. Should I have used a Swiss accent? St Laurent, this is Melchior. Go ahead, Melchior. Are the quads there? Yes, I just saw them. You should check the delivery. OK, I'll do that. Feel free to help! What's the dumb bitch up to? No idea. Mina...... It's me. It's me. I say we leave her. Let's go. We've been hit. Come in, Melchior. We've been hit! Look out! What the hell are you doing? Don't wait for her! They're firing at us! Stabilize the chopper! Stabilize it! For fuck's sake, Virgil! Now? Wait. We're gonna die! Virgil, now, dammit! GO! NOW! We coulda been killed! You're crazy! All that for some whore! She worked for me. Calm down. We made it. I'm not so sure. We were hit. We're too heavy to reach Brazil. You better explain. Nothing to explain. You shoulda let me blow'em up sooner. Hands off, you whore! Don't say that! I'll say whatever I like! It's your fault we're in shit. Don't go bustin' our balls! You got your guy killed... Shut up! Shut the fuck up! Give that to me. Give it to me. Drop it. Scumbag! They must know we landed. We need another chopper. Check if you have a signal. Check if you have a signal. NO. They'll come for us. We gotta move. And fast. There's just one small problem. 600 kilos of gold. Do we carry it on our backs? We'll make stretchers. We won't make it. She's right. We're going too slow. And we're leaving very clear tracks. OK, there's only one thing for it. Gotta bury it. Bullshit! We'll get it later. I don't like the idea of... Going empty-handed. What if we can't come back? We don't have to bury it all. Yeah, OK. We each take what we can carry: 20 to 30 kilos. We bury the rest. The border is about 60 kms away. We rent a chopper in Brazil and come back for the gold. Why only take 20 kilos? We can take 30, 40 or 50 each! Up to you - you're carrying it. Goddam ants! Don't touch my share! Thank you. Here's the coordinates. 2 degrees north, 33 minutes 58 seconds. 53 degrees west, 48 minutes 10 seconds. If we go south, we come to the Sapucai. We follow it to the sea. Mining policy is bullshit now. In South Africa, they go 3,000 meters underground. 500 deaths a year. Know why? 'Cause the multinationals dictate the conditions. Communist? No, geologist, but I know them. Truth is, we've given up on the miners. When you're with armed men, don't talk politics. You'll live longer! The thousands of illegals in this jungle all have radios. Right now, they all want us dead. They have better things to do than chase us. They just want to feed their families. Shut up and move. Got a train to catch? Know where you're going? D'you want to do it? Shit! Fuck! It bit me! Shit, it bit me! It's not dangerous. He'll just have a fever. - What if she's wrong? - Then you'll die! The river! 8 kms in 6 hours! At this rate, it'll take us a week! What, then? Do we call a cab? We let the current carry us along. I'm not doing that, with all the crap in there. There's not more in there than out here. Let's camp here. It'll be dark in 2 hours. OK. We leave at dawn. You're right, let's go now before they catch up with us. Don't worry. Georges will make a safety zone. You need to rest. I'll come with you. I'll find us something to eat. You love it, too, don't you? The Wayanas call it the flesh of God. Great! Saints' halos, Egyptian sarcophaguses, Byzantine icons, statues of Buddha, Inca temples... Same in every civilization. The symbol of purity and perfection! I've heard that crap for 25 years! Gold is an alloy of blood and sweat. This shit feeds on corpses. It changes without any scruples. Gold teeth from the gas chambers became baby's bracelets, baptism medallions. Or your wedding ring! Who said you could touch that? I'll give her some. What? Squandering your fortune?! What's she up to? It repels mesquites. Oh, yeah? Maybe we did her well to bring her! She can use the hammock in there. Thanks. The rafts are ready. What did I say? You keep watch first. It's me. Here. Why give'em to me? So you can cut'em up! Why did you wait for me? You'd be in Brazil now. I didn't wait for you. It takes time to take off. Thanks, all the same. He said he came to Guiana because of you. Yeah. There was a job protecting the space center. He stayed on to look for gold. He found you. He did all that for you. Who're you doing it for? For me. I don't believe you. - It's true. - It's not about the gold. Maybe I was bored, too. Yeah. I can believe that. Are we gonna make it? There's a price on our heads. There's plenty of bastards here. Usually they kill for a few grams, so for 600 kilos... They'll come after us for the reward. Not very optimistic! Shut up, dammit! Fuckin' jungle! We've reached the forbidden zone. It's a sanctuary to protect the Indians. We can't go on. They stole 600 kilos of gold. I informed Paris. Down there is where it's happening. They have no chance of survival. If you can't find them, we will! The gold! The fuckin' gold! I can't see very well. Don't touch. What is it? What? You must've touched an urticant plant. Is it serious? I can't see a thing! There were at least 30 kilos of gold! It'll be alright. It'll be alright... He'll go blind if he's not treated. What if we leave them the gold? It's not the gold! It's that Indian! We should leave her here! Ask your pals. I bet they agree with me. I'm sick of your shit. Now we do as I say! Who is it? Let me. Here. Shoulda let me do it. They're just poachers. Since when did you care about being nasty? Shoulda killed'em. They saw us. They'll tell the garimpeiros. They're not the problem. What do you mean? I mean I used to work for mining groups. They're hard bastards. A gold mine is a money-making machine. All in cash. Politicians, secret services... They all get a cut. We just stole some of it. They're gonna send in the pros. A gold mine must be impregnable. Now there's a precedent. You can't blame us for a bunch of adventurers. You don't command enough respect. In South Africa, we were never hit. They know we use Melchior to buy the illegals' gold. We can't risk that getting out. If they don't get out alive, they won't talk. Yeah... I know this place. 2 ethnologists lived here with the Wayanas. I supplied them with fuel. And that can help us, can it? Maybe. But what're we doing here? There's a police barrage upstream. We didn't see it. Maybe the Indians ate them! What the hell is this? What the hell is this? What's going on? The river... It changed direction. The tide! The tide can make it change direction. I didn't think it could so far from the shore. So, we've gone the wrong way? Yeah. We've gone upriver. The sea's the other way. If we go back, we've wasted 2 days. You said yourself they're after us! We have to carry on. To go where? The source? Jerk! It's every man for himself. We stick together! What if we go our own way and you get the gold? And forget to share it? Calling me a thief? Think about it. It works both ways. You're wasting your breath. Who asked you, Ray Charles? You've had it, you hear? Had it! Maybe. But we go together. Let go of him, Enzo. Let go of him. Enzo, please. OK... I'll keep watch first. They went the wrong way. They're going upstream. I've been thinking. If we ever get out of this fuckin' mess, I'm quittin' all this shit. Anyway, I got nothing else to prove. Here, you should... Come see me in the South of France. I'll do you a bourride. My specialty. It's damn good. You take... Fuckin' jungle... What're you doing? I'm going after him. What're you talking about? You can't see a thing. You can help me. Don't worry, the jungle will see to him. Our priority is to keep going. NO. The baby's due. Do what you like. I'm staying with her. Give me your phones. Mine's dead. Give it to me, anyway. Give me an hour. Shit! Hello? Can't hear a thing! Maurice, it's Virgil. I need help. Forget it. Its business, not charity. Everyone knows you did it. 10 k's of gold for a chopper to Brazil. The cops questioned me. I can't help you. Hurry up. If I lose the signal, I've had it. 20 k's. Deal. Where are you? The inselberg near the forbidden zone. OK. I I'll be there at dawn. Alright. Where's the rest of the gold? Don't touch me! Enzo, it's me! It's alright now. I'll get Enzo. I'll be right back. Try to sleep. I won't go without you. I was wrong about you. Is that a compliment? Just think... Carl I SSS? Don't worry. I know a good clinic in Rio. I'll just take a look. Why did you wait for me? Go to sleep. There he is. Maurice sold us out. Why? They're military choppers. Hide! That was reconnaissance. They'll be back. If they sent choppers, the commandos are on the river. SO? I stink of gangrene. If they hospitalize me, they might save my arm. We'll tell the police We're garimpeiros. With the baby, they might take us by canoe as far as Brazil! It might work. Come on. Why are you doing this? I called them. They'll hunt me down. If they hunt me down, they'll find you three. I always thought Lionel was a lucky man. You don't know me very well. Take them away. Subtitles: J. Miller Subtitlingt TITRA FILM Paris
