[♪♪] [Arianna's voice, echoing] No! I'm not stupid, okay? [♪♪] I don't want to hear any excuses. Then why do you treat me like that? [♪♪] Well, I don't know what to believe anymore. [♪♪] [gasping intensely] [♪♪] Let's go. I'll get the door. Okay, I'll give this to you, sweetie. Here you go. Oh, baby! Oh, geez. Thank you. Ah. Big rush, huh? Yeah, I have to go to that property on Miller. Jordan said that there's some kind of water damage, or something is wrong. Geez, it's always something new at that house, huh? You have no idea. Are we, uh... still on for date night? Mm, you know... probably not tonight. [sighs] We should, um, really make the effort, Arianna. Yeah, well, we shouldn't force it, either. Look, I'm not trying to punish you, I'm just... I'm just busy. No. No, I know. I'll, uh, see you tonight Yeah, I'll see you. Love you. [smooch] Love you. Bye, babe. [engine starts] [♪♪] Come on, sweetie. [door thuds] But why can't I bring waffles for lunch? Life is full of mysteries, Izzy. I don't know what to tell you. - Good morning, Mr. Jean. - Hello there. - Hi, Mr. Jean. - Isabelle. How are you doing today? Okay. Just okay? I could be better. [Arianna chuckles] Okay, baby girl. You be good. And Mommy will pick you up later this afternoon, okay? - Okay. Bye, Mommy. - Bye. Have fun! [♪♪] [♪♪] [phone ringing] - Hi. Yeah? - [woman] Hi, hon'. Yeah, I'm just checking out a house. So, when am I coming over to see my granddaughter? Whenever you want. That's not an invitation. Mom, I just don't want you to feel like you have to babysit Isabelle all the time. Honey, listen. Do you remember when we went to the Philippines last year for your Dad's memorial? Of course, I do. It was lovely. It was lovely. And I was happy to do that for your dad's family, but it was also the end of a chapter. I'm retired now. I have my ocean view, I'm happy, I'm healthy, and I plan to spend loads of time with my granddaughter. Okay, Mom. How about Friday? We could, uh... have dinner or something. Oh, "dinner or something." I could do "dinner or something." Okay, great. So, how are things with you and Rick? Fine. Good. Yeah? Look, Mom. I have to get this done. We'll talk soon. Okay? We... All right, honey. Love you. Bye. [♪♪] Hello again. [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] [sighs] Hi. It's me. [♪♪] It's worse. We're gonna need the carpenters in here ASAP. We can't show it like this. [♪♪] Okay, I'll be waiting. [♪♪] [engine starts] [♪♪] What the hell? Oh, God! Oh, God. Stop! Stop! [screams] [crashing, glass shattering] [♪♪] [steam hissing] [monitor beeping] [♪♪] S-She's stirring! Prepare the antibiotic. Hey. We're right here. I'm just gonna remove this tube, okay? Arianna? Arianna, welcome back. You are one lucky woman. There's someone who's been waiting to see you. Arianna. Baby? Hey. [whimpers] [weakly] I'm sorry, I don't... [Rick] Ari? Rick, could you see me in my office when you have a minute? Tatiana, could you monitor her vitals, please, and don't leave her. [monitor beeping] [♪♪] - [knocking] - Come in. Doctor. Have a seat. I just want to give you the full picture. Her cognition, her motor skills... Everything is intact. We can be thankful for that. She doesn't know who I am. Memory loss can be common in people who've undergone the kind of trauma that she has. However, her brain scans don't show the kind of long-term damage that we would typically associate with permanent loss or difficulty forming new memories. So, does that mean Ari's going to recover? There is no magic formula for these things, there's... there's no timetable. It could take days or it could take years for her to fully recover. Rick, I know this is a hard pill to swallow, but it's going to be even harder for her, and she's going to need you to be her rock. Yeah. Let's get the two of you reacquainted. [monitor beeping] I imagine that you have some questions, Arianna. Just a couple. You have been in a medically-induced coma for the past three months. - Three months? - Mm-hmm. And some change. And Rick, here, has been by your side every step. My name is Dr. Reynolds, and you and I have spent a lot of time together since you first arrived. I don't... [hyperventilates] What happened to me? You were in a car accident. You suffered multiple injuries to your limbs and your head. We had to keep you under, artificially, until the swelling in your brain subsided. [exhales] Fortunately... If I can use that term here... Being laid up for so long gave your bones time to heal. You're going to need rehabilitation, though, to get back your full mobility. Now, if you do the work, you will be able to be up walking again without assistance in the next few months. You're going to have to keep the brace on, though, for some time. Keeping everything in place and strong after suffering multiple compound fractures isn't something that comes easily. What about my memory? That... is a little trickier. As I was explaining to your husband before... [rapid footsteps] Mommy! Whoa, whoa, whoa, honey. Let's be careful. Hi. [Rick] Be gentle, Isabelle. Are you feeling better now, Mommy? [Rick] Almost. Mommy's still a little sick. But you're awake for good now, right? Yes. Grandma said we could bring you home. - We missed you, honey. - [gasps] Hi... Mom. [gasps and sobs] [Arianna hyperventilating] It's gonna take time. Don't lose hope. [weeps] You can do this. [Arianna sniffling] This was from our engagement party. Your father was so happy. Actually, he got a little too happy and your cousins had to help him back to his room. [Rick laughs] Is he...? Two years ago. It was rough. He was a really good man. [sighs deeply] Who is this? That's Jordan. She's, uh, one of your best friends. I think... [♪♪] I think I recognize her. Kind of. She lives close to us. She actually was a really big help while you were laid up. She practically took care of Isabelle for me. Rides. Meals. I-I was a mess right after it all happened. How's it coming along, Arianna? [Arianna sighs] Frustrating. We're looking at pictures from our old albums. We're still working on it. Well, that's all you can do. I think I actually recognize one of my friends. In a way. That's excellent. You see? You never know what could trip those neurons. So, it is time for your rehab session, tomorrow. Are you feeling up for it? I guess. Well, let's get those dancing shoes out, then. Get some rest. [grunting] Okay. Okay. [grunts] Okay, Arianna. It's just a small step. Okay. [grunting intensely] Come on. [crying out] I got it, I got it! I'm gonna take a couple... [Natalie] Okay. [Rick] Come on, baby. You can do this. - [groaning] - [Natalie] You can do it! [crying out] All right. That's it for today. You did fantastic. [wheezing] Really? Most people in your position give up on even getting out of the chair on their first try. You did great. She's got spunk, Mr. Moore. Oh, I know she does. Okay, let's get you back. Oh! [Natalie] Here we go. [Arianna grunting and straining] Yeah, nice and easy. Here we go. There's the chair. Yeah. Okay. I'm gonna get you. Here. [Arianna groans] All right. Okay. All right? See you guys tomorrow. Good job. You did really well, Ari. Yeah. You heard what they said. I know. I didn't realize how messed up I was. You'll get through it. [gasping] Hi-i-i-i! Oh! Ohh... Oh! Too tight? I'm sorry. [♪♪] Thank you! Cheers. Did we toast Auntie Jordan? [Arianna laughing] What? Um... nothing. I just recognize you, that's all. [chuckles] Hi, Rick. How's it going? Just happy that our girl's back. How was therapy? Good. Rick's been a really great help. Aw, yeah, he's such a good man. Aunt Jordan! [gasps] Hi! [Lucy] Okay, okay, be careful. [Jordan] Izzy-Bizzy. You haven't been over in three days. I know. I was just so exhausted after the last time we played, that I needed a break. No, you're making that up. No, I'm serious! [gasps playfully] Say hi to your mom. Hi, Mommy. Hi. Rick told me that you were a huge help with her. Of course. Anything for you guys. Besides... I love this little nugget. [chuckling] [Dr. Reynolds] Hi, everyone. I'm sorry, Arianna. I don't want to butt into your visit, but it is time for your med. Now, this pink one might make your head feel a little heavy. All right, sweet girl, you have been so well-behaved, that I'm gonna get you a treat from the machine before we go. [♪♪] Yeah! Go for it. [Izzy] Yes! [Lucy] And if you want Grandma to come with you, you have to stop running. Thank you for watching her, Lucy. Oh, it's no hassle. Are you gonna stay here tonight? Yes. Yes, thanks again. And I will see you on Friday, honey. [♪♪] Let me know if you're feeling a little off, okay? - All right. - Thanks. So, what are we looking at? [♪♪] How's our girl? Fine. Would you give me a ride home? Didn't you drive? I took an Uber. Come on. Don't make me beg. No problem. Thank you. I'll see you at the car. [♪♪] [♪♪] All right. See you soon. Aren't you going to walk me to the door, like a gentleman? [Rick sighs] Jordan, we can't do this. Yes, we can. She can't get hurt if she doesn't find out. That's not the point. I'm just saying it's a good thing no one's hurting her. Thank God no one's told her. What does that mean? And it should definitely stay that way, as long as I get what I want. [giggling flirtatiously] Come on, baby. Don't call me that. Just one last time. I know that we can't keep having fun now that Ari's awake, but I just want to say goodbye to this chapter in our lives. By blackmailing me? One last time, and then you can go back to that ball-and-chain life. I will make it worth your while, I promise. Stop. Come on. [Rick] Stop. [♪♪] [car door opens] Whatever you say. [car door shuts] [car engine engages] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Arianna screaming] [♪♪] [gasps deeply] You scared me. Hey, hey, are you okay? [exhaling deeply] Yeah, I'm okay. I just, um, just had a weird dream. It's probably the medication. Where are you coming from? Oh, I... I just took Jordan home. - Oh. - What? [Arianna] She's so close to us, and so helpful. I wish I remembered Jordan. I don't remember why we're friends. [Rick] Well, you two were already close when I met you. She was your maid of honor. Countless dinners, parties, vacations together. It seems like she's always been a part of our lives. You need to get some rest to heal. The doctor said your memories should return with some exercise and patience. [♪♪] [Arianna] I just wish I could place it all. [Rick] You will, baby. Soon. [Jordan] As long as I get what I want... [♪♪] How old is Isabelle? She's eight. Her birthday is in August... August 12th? Yeah. We took her and some friends to Disney this summer. She was too scared to get on any of the rides, so we spent the whole day in the massive food pavilion. Hey. Hey, what's wrong, baby? Nothing. Just sounds like a nice memory. You'll get it back. I hope so. Let's get some sleep, huh? You've had a hard day. Yeah, you're right. Goodnight. 'Night. [♪♪] Yeah, it's looking good. You know, when you get home, the crutches will be like a lifeline. However, you're gonna have to keep working at it. - [Rick] There you go. - [Natalie] Look at you! [grunting] [Natalie] All right! Yes. [Rick] That's beautiful. Come on, now. [Natalie] Yes. [Rick] Just a little more, a little more. [Natalie] You're doing so good. [Rick] Baby, you're doing so good. [Natalie] Okay, you're doing it! [Rick] Wow, that's amazing. Keep it up. - Great job, baby. - Thanks. [Dr. Reynolds] Good morning, Arianna. Rick. Morning. Hey, Doctor. We have some good news. Outside of your memory issues and some tender bones, you are otherwise a very healthy woman. Now, I just have to finish reviewing your test results and, if all goes well, we can have you discharged this afternoon. Thank God. That's great! You know, most patients would prefer not to stay in the hospital. No. No, it's not... it's not that. What's wrong, honey? I just... I guess I'm not really sure what I'm going back to. I know that might sound weird. Jumping back into the real world can be overwhelming for patients dealing with what you're going through, but, if it helps, I can pretty much assure you that the food out there is way, way better. [laughter] That's probably true. You're gonna be fine. And you have a great teammate here to help you. It was great to meet you. And if there is a "next time," I certainly hope it is under better circumstances. You take care. Thank you. [♪♪] [Dr. Reynolds] Remember, anything can be the key that opens the lock. You have to keep your mind and body active. It's not just about doing the rehabilitation exercises. You're not in this alone. You're surrounded by people that love you. [♪♪] [clicks radio on] [reporter] A bombing that left four dead and dozens injured. In mental health news... [click] [♪♪] [Arianna] It's beautiful. You've always loved it here. [Arianna] Are we close by? [Rick] Yeah, we're almost there. [♪♪] [♪♪] Careful. [♪♪] Nice. - [grunting] - Come on, honey. There you go. [doorbell rings] [Rick] Ah. I'll get it. - You're good? - Yeah. All right. - Hi. - What are you doing? I'm here to see Arianna, silly. [Rick] Look, I, uh... Hey. Hey, pretty lady. How is the transition going? Uh, um... Tough. Better now, though. Well, anything you need, girl, I am here for you. It's really okay, Jordan. Arianna's mom and I can handle things for now. Stop. It's nothing. I will go pick up Izzy, and you can stay home with your wife. It's really sweet of you, but, uh... you've already done plenty. He's just so humble. It's fine, Rick. Are you sure we're not burdening you? Yeah, it's no problem. I flipped a huge property last month. I have nothing else to do. I am here for you guys. Thanks. Uh, we appreciate it. You're welcome. I will go get Izzy and you guys get settled. Thank you so much. Oh, I'm gonna take your tablet, so that I can let Izzy watch some shows on the way home. Of course. Thank you again. You're welcome. [footsteps receding] Okay, honey. You got this. Okay, let me try myself. All right. I'm right behind you. - Okay. - Okay? Yes! [Arianna wheezing] All right. First battle won. How am I gonna do this? [door opens, footsteps] Aunty Jordan let me watch shows in the car! [Arianna] Oh, that's great, honey. And she took me shopping! Why don't we... [♪♪] Okay. [♪♪] Well, I don't remember this, but it's much more comfortable than the hospital bed. [laughs] So... [text alert chimes] Are you gonna get that? It's probably just work. Then you should probably get it. Is... Is everything okay? Hmm? You look concerned. [chuckles uneasily] It's nothing. Just something I have to take care of later. Are you feeling better? Yeah, um, just a little hungry. Let me get you something. Is there a problem between you and Jordan? No. No, why? It's just the way you were talking earlier, it's like you had an issue with her or something. Uh, I don't know. Maybe it's just the stress of everything, just getting you situated back here. It felt like... you were being rude to her when all she did was offer to help. Maybe I just got sick of having her at the house all the time. I don't know. Let me get you something to eat. [♪♪] [dialing] [line ringing] [phone rings] Hey, handsome. What are you doing? I don't know. What am I doing? Arianna could have seen those texts. You're no fun now that she's around again. Look. It's over, Jordan. Okay? I was weak without Arianna around a-and I was stupid, but I can't do wrong by her again. Do you understand? Well, we can all get what we want. I don't want to damage your family either. You know how much I love all of you. No one has to know anything but us. Jordan... I love when you say my name. I'll see you later. - I... - Bye. [♪♪] [sighs] [♪♪] [Arianna] No! I'm not stupid, okay? [Jordan] If you don't want to believe me, Ari, that's fine. [Arianna] I don't want to hear any excuses. [Jordan] I love you, Ari. I am here for you. [Arianna] Then why do you treat me like that? [Jordan] What are you asking me? I'm starting to look like you, am I? [Arianna] I don't know what to believe anymore. [Jordan] What are you asking me? [gasps deeply] [panting] [Rick grunts groggily] [lamp clicks on] Are you okay? Yeah. I must have just jostled myself. You want one of your, uh, pain pills? No. No, I'm good. Go back to sleep. All right. Love you. [♪♪] [♪♪] [Arianna clears her throat] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Okay. Okay. - Are you sure? - I got it. [♪♪] Ah! - Oh! Whoa! Watch it. [grunts in rage] This is so frustrating! I know, baby. I can't walk on my own. I can't remember anything. I can't remember anything. I'm sorry to complain so much. I love you. I just feel... trapped. Maybe that's not the right word. I think I have something you can do. Yeah. Come on. [♪♪] Are you sure you should be driving already? Dr. Reynolds says it's fine. I should really start moving around on my own. I know you love doing it, but I feel so guilty treating you like Izzy's chauffeur. We'll be back soon. [door shuts] Okay. Sounds good. [engine starts] Okay, let's get inside. [Rick, laughs] There's that smile! [chuckling] Feels good to actually move around. I don't know if I can keep up! [laughs] Were you always this corny? Yep. [laughs] I guess if there's one upshot to this whole ordeal, it's that you get to find out how annoying I am all over again. How romantic. Here, take a right at the next stop sign. Okay. This is... where... it happened, right? Yeah. [♪♪] [♪♪] Why was I out here, again? Some kind of inspection or problem you had to deal with before you could move the property. I honestly forget. [tires screeching] [sound distorting and echoing] How about we go somewhere with happy memories? I have something to show you. Come on. [♪♪] I got you. Nice. [♪♪] Wow. ♪ What goes around... ♪ ♪ It comes around... ♪ - Help me down? - Yeah. ♪ ...It hits you in the heart ♪ ♪ Leaves you on the ground ♪ So this is our spot? [chuckles] Yeah. When we first got married, we lived in a studio above a kebab place downtown. I still gag whenever I smell paprika. [chuckles] Every Sunday, we'd come out here. And spend the day until the sun set. Sometimes, we'd bring or bikes, or go for a hike. And whenever it got too cold, we would just pack a lunch and have a picnic in the car. Stare out into the waves and dream about getting here one day... raise a family. [♪♪] I missed you, baby. [♪♪] I see it... before we upgraded the car, I guess. Ha! The Protege? [remembering] The Protege! [both laughing] [♪♪] It really is gorgeous. I can see why we came up here all those times. [♪♪] Mm. [♪♪] [♪♪] [Arianna, echoing] I'm not stupid, okay? [Jordan] Of course. Anything for you guys. [laughter echoes] [Rick] I miss you. [Jordan] Mm-hmm? [laughing] [Rick] You don't have to apologize. [Jordan laughing] [Rick] It's probably just her. [Jordan laughing] [Jordan] I love this little nugget. [♪♪] [gasping] [breathing deeply] [♪♪] [Rick] I'm her husband and I love her, and I want you to leave us alone. [Jordan, laughing] Don't be ridiculous! Don't laugh at me, dammit. Or what? You're gonna tell her? That'll work out well for you. Oh, or no, maybe I should. I didn't think so. I'm not going anywhere. If you try to get rid of me, I will expose us... Every detail, every message that you've sent me in the middle of the night. Do you understand? - Yes. - Good. Now. Why don't you be a big boy and stop making everything so difficult? For everyone's sake. Oh! - [Jordan chuckles] - [door opens] Come on upstairs and wash your hands! Why don't you go wake up Arianna? Bring her on in. Dinner's almost ready. [♪♪] Hi. Oh. You're up already. And you made it here all by yourself. Sure did. You okay? Yeah, I just... I thought I heard yelling or something. Oh. Oh, well, Isabelle got that new game. I try to tell her to play without the sound on, but it's not worth fighting with her sometimes. Mm. Right. Your mom's here for dinner. I'm gonna so set the table. Okay. All right. [♪♪] [sighs tensely] [Jordan] Goodnight, Lucy. Thanks for coming. [♪♪] [♪♪] [whispering] My pretty little girl... my pretty... pretty little girl. My pretty... pretty little girl. [♪♪] [♪♪] [gasps] Good morning, pretty girl. - "Pretty." - Mm-hmm. [smooch] [Arianna] You okay? [Rick] Yeah. Why? You seem a little jumpy or something. I don't know. Ah, I'm just happy you're back. You know, it was hard without you. I didn't know if you were gonna wake up, and, with Isabelle, I... I just felt so hopeless and lost. So alone. Every day, I wondered if I'd have to explain to her that... [exhales] She really missed you. Thank God for Jordan. Yeah. I guess, um... Speaking of which, I wonder if Iz is done with breakfast. You know, I should probably get something to eat, too. Can you help me get dressed? Yeah. Yeah. You're getting good at this. Thanks. All right, I've got an early sales call. I'll see you tonight, baby. Love you! Love you. Oh, good morning, Mommy. [Jordan] Good morning. You're sleeping late, huh? Yeah, I didn't hear you show up. I've got to get this little nugget off to school. Oh, no, you've done enough, making breakfast already. I could take care of that, if you want to go. [Jordan] Stop it. I have to head up to Bayside to inspect a new listing. It's on the way. Come on, baby girl. [Arianna] Bye, Isabelle. Oh, bye, Mom. She forgot her knapsack. [♪♪] [♪♪] [breathing deeply] [winces and groans] [inhales deeply] [chuckles in disbelief] [laughs] [humming] Hmm-hmm-hmm... Knife. Knife... Knife! [humming happily] [♪♪] [faucet running] [Arianna, echoing] Isabelle? - Izzy? - [Rick] Isabelle! [Arianna] Did you check outside? [Rick] The door would've beeped. [Arianna] Why weren't you watching her? [Rick] I was! I... I just got distracted, I guess. [Arianna] What, texting somebody? [Rick] Come on, Ari. Not now! Isabelle? Izzy? [shuts faucet off] [Arianna] Isabelle? [♪♪] - Izzy? - Isabelle! [♪♪] Isabelle! Honey. Oh. What are you doing? Hey. I want to go to Aunt Jordan's. [Arianna] Well, I can take you to Aunt Jordan's any time. How were you gonna get there, silly? I don't know. I just want to go to Jordan's. What's wrong, baby? Why are you and Daddy always fighting? Sometimes, mommies and daddies fight. It doesn't mean anything's wrong. You know we love you, right? Nobody's angry at you. Come on. Let's go get a snack. [♪♪] Ah! [groaning] [Jordan] The teacher said you're doing so well at school. Okay, go to the bathroom, get your hands washed up, then we will get a quick snack and start your homework. Okay! [♪♪] Ari? - [cries out] - Arianna? [groaning] I'm in the laundry room! [groaning] - Oh, God. - What happened to you? Ah, I was trying to get a stain out of my shirt, and I slipped. It was stupid. Why aren't you using your crutches? I'm supposed to practice not using them. Guess I got a little ahead of myself. But that's so irresponsible of you. How could you do that? You have a little girl out there who is relying on you. I'm sorry? And you're feeding her peanut butter-and-jelly and cookies? Do you really think that's an appropriate after-school snack when she just had cake last night? Calm down, Jordan. - I just... - "Just"? Just what? I will not let you ruin what I have done for that girl. Do you understand? [indistinct conversations] [Arianna] This is ridiculous. [Jordan] I think you're being paranoid. Paranoid? You can't tell me nothing's going on. If you don't want to believe me, Ari, that's fine. Well, I want to believe you, Jordan. He's been acting so weird lately, and these messages... What are you asking me? What are you trying to say right now? Jordan... I love you, Ari, and I am here for you, but I will not stand here and be called a whore. Well, I don't know what to believe anymore. Well, let me know when you decide. Martha! Hi! [♪♪] Hi! [Rick slurring] Was it... Was it a deejay or was that just from the music? I don't... I don't know. [laughs] What a great afternoon. Certainly looked like you had fun. Yeah. We gotta hang out with that crew again. [laughing] What was the name of that girl with the... with the green dress and the heels. Do you know? [laughs] [teasing] Earth to Ari. [snaps] No! Why? What's up? Did you not have a good time? I'm getting sick of this, Rick. Of what? I'm not stupid, okay? I don't think that you are. Then why do you treat me that way? Ari, I... I don't want to hear any excuses. If I see any text messages between you or any of my friends again, you are gonna have to move out. Yeah. [Arianna] Stay silent. I'm sorry for that. I'm just... I'm very protective of her. It's not your fault. [uneasily] It's okay. Can you just get my crutches, please? Of course. Of course. [wincing] [panting] [Jordan] Look. Look at this. [Isabelle laughing] [Isabelle] Auntie Jordan, you're so much fun! [Jordan] I'm gonna win, I'm gonna win. Oh, you got me! Good job! "Investigation"? [♪♪] [sighs apprehensively] This doesn't make any sense. What the hell? "Search filters..." [gasps softly] [breath shaking] [reporter] though initially suspected, investigators now say Mrs. Moore's husband, Rick, pictured here, is no longer being questioned in relation to the accident. [gasps] [hyperventilating] [dialing] [line ringing] [Lucy] Hello? Mom? Can we talk? [♪♪] [door opens] [Lucy] Hello? Arianna? [door closes] Hey, Luce. What's going on? Uh, Arianna asked me to come by. Oh, Ari's resting. Well, that's great. Hey, Lucy. Do you mind if I ask you something? Yes? Are you worried about Isabelle? She's just been through so much with Ari being in the hospital for so long, and now everything is changing so fast. I just think that she's happy to be back with her mom, above anything else. Of course. We all are! I just... think consistency is so important in a child's life, and I've been such a big part it, I don't know how she's gonna adjust to me not being around. What are you getting at? Nothing! I just wanted your opinion. As her grandma. Well, as her grandma... I think that's probably a conversation you should be having with her parents. You're right. Ari's waiting. [♪♪] [Lucy] Hi. Hi. Do you remember me talking about it at all? For a while, I thought the two of you might separate. And what was I saying? You thought he was going around behind your back. Frankly, I didn't doubt it. But then, things seemed to be improving between the two of you, you know, before the accident. What do you mean? You just seemed... better. At Izzy's last birthday, you were so happy together. And then, after the accident, the way he was devoted to you, I just thought that whatever issues the two of you were having were behind you. I really don't know what it was. Why do you ask, honey? [takes a deep breath] [sighing] I don't know how to say this. Something is wrong with him. It's like he's hiding secrets from me all the time. I know the investigation was inconclusive, but... If you saw how devoted he's been to you the last three months, you wouldn't even ask. He wanted to be with you every moment in that hospital room. He tried to hide it from me. What do you mean? When I tried looking up articles about it online before, he put a block on all of it. He didn't want me to know. Well, he's probably just protecting you, Ari. The police exonerated him for a reason. [Arianna] Yeah, maybe I'm just crazy. It all just came rushing back, you know? The texts and then the fight, and then I read about the investigation online. You're not crazy. You've been through a traumatic event. [voice breaks] Yeah. Either way, I'm not comfortable with Jordan being around so much now. I don't know if they did anything, but... you understand? Of course. Isabelle's so close to her, though. I can't just rip them apart, can I? You know what? I'll stay over a couple nights a week. Shake things up, start weaning her off their routine. Thanks... Mom. It feels better knowing that I have you. Everything's gonna be okay, honey. 'Kay. [sniffles] [footsteps] So, I was thinking I would give you a break tonight. Oh, really? I could use a break, to be honest. Yeah, you've done so much. So I'm just gonna pop back home, grab a few things, so I can stay the night. Oh. Okay. Okay, great. Okay. Great. I'll see you in a bit. Oh! Before you go, you should try this new chai detox drink I just made. It is really great. Maybe when I get back. Oh, no, it's never the same reheated. Come on, you love my cooking, right, Lucy? Come on. Don't hurt my feelings. Well, we wouldn't want to do that. Mm. It's nice. Do you like it? My nutritionist gave me the recipe a few days ago. It's got a bit of a kick. It does, it's a little peppery. Just give it an hour or so to kick in, and you're gonna feel so good. Thanks. That was great. Oh, wait. I have a to-go cup for you. Good to see you. [footsteps receding] [♪♪] Mm! That was delicious. [♪♪] [clicks radio on] [radio reporter] And all in all, heading into the weekend, things are particularly good. It's clear on the 5, and heading down at 2:00 to take a look at the coastline. So enjoy yourselves if you're heading out that way. All in all, it should be... [tires squealing] [tires squealing] [tires squealing] [crash] [horn blares] [doctor] The toxicology report hasn't come back yet, but it looks like she's accidentally ingested a medication that sent her into anaphylactic shock. What? Are you aware of any prescriptions that she's on, or have there been any changes to them recently? I... [sob escapes] I actually... I don't know. She's just on blood-thinners. I mean, as far as I know. [doctor] Hmm. Well, like I said, the results aren't back yet, so we just can't tell, but, luckily enough, it looks like she's vomited up whatever it was. So, when the sedatives wear off, we'll be able to ask her what happened. I'm so sorry. I know it's been scary... but she is going to be okay. Thank you, Doctor. If I didn't ask her to come over, she wouldn't have been on the road. Ari, don't do this to yourself. It's the truth. Okay. What do you want to do? You go. I'm gonna stay here for a while. Are you sure? I can stay. No. It's okay. Okay. I'll... I'll see you at home. [♪♪] I'm so sorry, Mom. [sobbing] So sorry. [engine starts] [♪♪] [humming] [footsteps] Oh! Izzy-Bizzy Oh. My pretty little girl. Hi, Jordan. [Arianna] Hey. Good morning. - Morning, Mommy. - Good morning. I'll take Iz to school today. Are you sure? She has to... Really, it's nothing. I should start getting back into the groove of things anyway. Okay. Well, I will pick you up this afternoon. No, really, Jordan. I appreciate all your help, but it's time I start taking back a lot of these responsibilities. You're right. Okay. Looks like mama's gonna take you to school today. - Okay. - Let's go. [♪♪] Okay, let's get this show on the road, huh? Buckle up, honey. You got it? All right. I'll see you later, guys. All right, bye. It is so good that you are well enough to do this. You'll call me if you need any help? I think I got it. [♪♪] [door shuts] Ready? [engine starts] [♪♪] [♪♪] [♪♪] Arianna! It's been so long. Hi! How are you? We're glad to see you're feeling better. - We missed seeing you. - Ah, well... they can't keep me away forever. Well, Isabelle was in good hands while you were sick. Your nanny is really protective of her. "Nanny"? Oh, right. Jordan. She certainly is. All right, young lady. You ready to learn? Okay, baby. I'll pick you up at 2:00, okay? - Bye, Mommy. - Bye. [school bell rings] [line rings] [voicemail] Hey, you've reached Rick. Sorry I can't get to the phone right now. [line rings] [huffs bitterly] [♪♪] [♪♪] [lid clatters] [exhales] [♪♪] [♪♪] [phone ringing] - Hello? - Hi, Mrs. Moore. It's Dr. Scott calling to update you on your mother's condition. Oh, yes. Yes, please go ahead. Well, your mother is recovering well and toxicology reveals whatever substance that she ingested has been flushed from her system. Oh, thank God. However, although the results of testing are indeterminate, it appears that she has overdosed on a substance that caused her to lose consciousness while she was driving. How can that be? She's only taking her blood thinners. Like I said, the results are indeterminate, and there appears to be no further risk from whatever it was. Okay. What about the rest of her injuries? She is stabilized and we should be able to move her out of the I.C.U. in a day or so, into another ward. [exhales deeply] Thank you so much, Doctor. We haven't told our daughter what happened to her grandma yet, we were... we were so scared we might lose her. Well, she'll be home soon enough. Would you be able to come down to the hospital later, to sign off on some paperwork for her transfer? Of course. Of course. I should be there in an hour. Wonderful. We'll see you then, Mrs. Moore. You're very lucky here, all things considered. Thank you again, Doctor. [breath shaking] [exhales deeply] [♪♪] Is everything okay, Jordan? What happened? I have to tell you something. I don't even know how to say this. It's about Richard. I think I know. No. No, you don't. You can tell me, Jordan. Did something happen between you two? He's always tried to seduce me, but I would never do that to you. No matter how uncomfortable it got when you were in the coma, I still had to be here. I was afraid of what he would do to... her. What do you mean? He would always talk about what it would be like to be single, to not have a family. I thought he was just saying that. [♪♪] [Jordan, echoing] I think you're being paranoid. If you don't want to believe me, Ari, that's fine. What are you saying, Jordan? Have you ever looked up your accident online? I didn't want to believe it, but I couldn't shake my suspicions. What? I think he knows that I suspect him. He's been so aggressive lately. I couldn't abandon you and Izzy. I'm so sorry. That's why Lucy and I wanted to hire a private investigator, but he just wanted us to "move on." He was covering his tracks. He tried to hide the articles from me, too. He tried to kill you, Ari. Okay. Okay, we need to get out of the house... and call the police. You're right. You pack up everything that you need, I'll get you to your mom's condo. That's a good idea. What are we gonna do about Isabelle? I'll go sign her out of school. You just concentrate on getting everything that you guys need. Thank you, Jordan. I don't know what we would have done without you. Of course. I love you guys. [pained] Ah. Here, take these. All right. Thank you, Jordan. Thanks. [Jordan] I'll be right back. It's going to be okay. [♪♪] [♪♪] You got everything you need? [disoriented] Uh... Your crutches. Crutches... [thud] Told you to be careful with those pills. You can really overdo it. [Arianna cries out] [Arianna groaning] [sighs wearily] You're quite the little survivor, aren't you? You and your pain-in-the-ass mother, you just can't stay out of the way and let us be happy! Ugh! [huffs] You... don't deserve any of this... This house, that beautiful little girl, that handsome, sweet husband that you torture and treat like crap. It's always about you! I can't wait until I can take Izzy to your grave and tell her what a terrible mother you've been. Really! Let her appreciate everything that I have done for her! [♪♪] [♪♪] - [Jordan grunts] - [Arianna whimpers and groans] [♪♪] I love you, Ari. [chuckles] Unfortunately, her grandmother has taken a turn for the worse. We think this might be it. Oh, how awful. Yeah, we haven't said anything to Izzy yet. Hey, Izzy-Bizzy. We're gonna you out of school today for a shorter day. How does that sound? Mommy said she was gonna pick me up. Oh, I know, but she had an errand to run, and she asked me to come pick you up. It's okay, honey. Mommy's waiting at home for you. Okay, let's go. Thank you. [♪♪] [coughing] [coughing] [gasps] [groans] [coughing] [♪♪] [♪♪] [grunting intensely] [message alert chimes] [thudding] [shattering] [message alert chimes] [text whooshes] [grunting and groaning] [straining] Buckle your seatbelt, sweetie. - Got it. - [click] - Call Richard. - Calling Richard. [phone ringing] Hello? Hey, baby. Don't call me that, and don't call my phone, okay? It's over. Goodbye. Wait. I need you to meet me. It's about Isabelle. What are you talking about? I can't say over the phone, but I need you to come meet me. Say hi to Daddy! Hi, Daddy. Why isn't she in school? Relax. She's safe. Everyone is safe. I need you to come meet me at the pit at the north end of the cove, and it will stay that way. - Jordan, what are you... - Okay, bye! Where are we going? [laughs] We're gonna have so much fun with Daddy. Hi. You've reached Arianna. [grunting intensely] Ah! Ah! Ah. Ohh. [wheezing] Oh, dammit! Ugh! [wheezing and panting] [rumbling] [rumbling] [groaning and grunting] [slams door] [engine starts] Hi. Mrs. Moore? This is Mr. Jean from elementary. [Arianna] Yes, Mr. Jean? [Mr. Jean] Did you authorize Isabelle to be taken out of school early? [Arianna] What? No! [Mr. Jean] Your nanny, Jordan, was here. She picked her up. It seemed odd so I thought I should call you. - When? - About 20 minutes ago. Okay, Mr. Jean, I'm sending you my location. I need you to call the police. [♪♪] Isabelle, come here! - Hi! - Give me my daughter. Wait. Wait, wait, wait! I want to show you something. Look. [♪♪] I know how hard everything's been for you, but you don't have to worry. Is that the house? You don't have to worry about her feelings anymore. We can finally be together, a real family! Get away from us! I did this for us! Why do you have to make everything so hard? Do you know what I've done for you? Daddy, I'm scared. Jordan, don't do this. If you don't want to be a part of this family, that's fine, but I will not let you take my daughter away from me! Okay! Okay. We can talk about this, all right? Just please... Just please put the gun down. Okay? [sobbing softly] I tried so hard to make you happy. Izzy, run away! [Jordan gasps] [shot fires] Ahh! Ahh! [groaning and gasping] [whimpers] [fires] [gasps] [gurgling] [gasps] [groans and exhales deeply] [gasps and panics] [♪♪] [calling out] Come on, sweetie! [panting] [♪♪] [♪♪] Come on, sweetie! [♪♪] Izzy! Wait! [♪♪] Oh, my God! No. No, no, no! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick! Rick... Rick! [grunting weakly] Oh, get... Get Izzy. [groaning] [panting] [♪♪] [♪♪] [Jordan] Izzy, where are you? I'm going to find you. There you are! [♪♪] You can't run forever! [♪♪] It'll be okay. We can move somewhere new. Just you and me, Izzy. What do you say? Ah-hah! [♪♪] You won't even miss your mom and dad. Ha! Hi! I found you. Come on! [Izzy] No! [Arianna] Get the hell away from her! Come on, baby. Baby, come on. Come on. Come on. [thudding] [women struggling] [grunting] [Arianna grunts] [panting] [panting] [both grunting] Ah! [Jordan] You never loved them! She belongs with me. - Jordan, please! - [shot fires] Iz! Izzy! Izzy! - Izzy! - Mommy! Are you okay? Oh, God. Oh, oh... Are you okay? Are you okay? Oh, God. We need immediate medical assistance. [Arianna] Let's go find Daddy. Rick! Rick! [Rick] Where's Iz? She's safe. She's safe. I'm so sorry... I'm so sorry. I did this to us. No. I love you. Baby, we're good now, okay? [sirens wailing] How long will Daddy have to stay? He's gonna be in the hospital a little bit longer, but... we'll see him soon, okay, honey? Okay. [Arianna chuckles softly] Are you all right, Mommy? [takes a deep breath] I'm just happy to be with my favorite girl. [smooch] Okay, let's go. [♪♪] Hey, come here.
