How long does an abortion take? A few minutes. - Does it hurt? - Not usually. What's wrong? I think your dates are mixed up. I'd say you're 12 to 15 weeks pregnant. No. that's not right. You recently had a miscarriage six or seven weeks in? Yes. Well. I don't think you did. Did you have a scan? - No. - Why not? Well. I wasn't told to have one. I bled a lot. I had a miscarriage. I think this one's a surviving twin. Does this complicate matters? Is it OK? Your placenta's low. That usually rights itself. Other than that. she's perfectly normal. A mm? Yes. She's come so far. Well? I called them. She didn't have the abortion. She's having Tucker's baby. But it's mine. The bitch! No. No! Oh. my God. Oh. Jesus. No. Oh... Hi. Oh. my God. Oh. my...

You smell different. I am different. We're starting from now. From scratch. Everything from before is over. Is that all right? Yeah. - What's the matter? - The placenta's wrongly placed. See? See how it blocks the baby's exit. If it's low early on. it usually moves around. but by this stage if it hasn't... If it hasn't. then what? If it hasn't moved by the next scan. you'll have to have a Cesarean. - I don't understand. - The baby can't get out naturally. - Is it dangerous? - Without a Cesarean. yes. But don't worry. you'll be fine. - Where have you been? - I don't know. This thing's dying on me. Hey. - You all right? - Yeah. What are you doing? No. Wait. All right. OK. OK. OK. OK, all right.
