Thank you. - Uh-uh! You are supposed to be taking the week off. You're just gonna find something in here that's going to upset you. You're right. You're absolutely right. Quite a girl. Honey, this is the first time I've left you alone for any- - I should be worried. Daddy, you are a great district attorney, but you're a lousy hunter. - I've never left you alone for a week, honey. I just want you to listen carefully, and I want you to promise me three things. Number one- Do my homework. - Well, don't just do your homework. I want you to attack it with a vengeance. You know, the difference between law school and learning the locksmith trade through the mail could be something as simple as one single math assignment. What's two? - No boys in the house while I'm away. - We already had the genetics talk, all right. I have to say it. - I know. - And number three and most important, no cutting class. - No cutting class. - Until then you're daddy's little girl. Bye bye. Bye. - Be a good girl. I Will be. Have fun. - I will. Welcome to The Kill Zone, pal. - Hi, I heard the mallards run about 15, 20 pounds. You want to bag a mallard? - Yeah, that's why I'm out here camping. Come on. Yeah. Ya smell like the city. Now ya smell like the earth. - Thanks, uh, it's just what the doctor ordered. You know, you ought to bottle that stuff. Yeah. - Mr. District Attorney, over here.

Let's do that again, Mommy. Same time tomorrow? And so minerals is a world of immense complexity and fascination. Well, come in. You're just about to see the best part. Oh, the excitement of chemistry. Take a sodium and chlorine. Together, they combine to give us sodium chloride. Can anyone name that? Dwight? Salt. Salt! Correct, common table salt. But sodium and chlorine separately are highly volatile. Chlorine dropped into water gives off a deadly gas. - Didn't they use that stuff in World War I? Oh, it was outlawed, even too horrible for warfare. Breathing it, it caused the lungs to burn then melt. Ooh! Watch what happens when our friend Mr. Sodium goes swimming in ordinary H20. You do know what that is, Dwight? Water. It's water. Shut up. - Now that was just a small piece of sodium. Imagine what a lump like this would do. Keep it in your pants. Get up the rope. Come on, Brian, yeah! All the way to the top, big guy! Let's go, big guy, you can do it! Woo! Brian Woods, what are you doing? Okay, smart-ass, 30 push-ups! Concentrate, Woods, concentrate. J' In the city, guys dig girls _ Hey, - Hi, Gary. J' Guys did girls Did you see that? J' Now and ready, girls dig guys J'At the Bates Motel J' Girls dig guys - By the way, Frankenstein's staring at you. J' Guys dig girls J' To quote Mark Twain J' That when they piece it all together What are you lookin' at? Nothing. Oh, I think Brian likes you. Oh Brian, she likes you. Jeez. She's available, Friday night. _ H?Y- Let's go to your house, huh? Why? - Well, your father's still hunting. We can be alone. What do you have in mind? - I got my brother's ID, grab some beers. - But Dwight, Dwight, I can see through you like a piece of glass. Colleen, who asked ya, hmm? But beer is low-rent in romance. Paula's got class. She deserves a hell of a lot better. Oh, like What? Like your ring. Your ring! - I think it's about time she got something for her pain. Yeah, it would be nice. - Yeah, well, I'm gonna get something to eat. You want anything? Well, if I can't have your ring, I have this craving for a hot dog. J' On a perfect world J' The angels sing Who's this for? You. - How did you know that I wanted one? You had that look. - You're not gonna eat that thing, are you? Why not? I'm hUflQrY- Brian beat ya to it. Get in the car. Dwight. - Get in the car! J' That thing you told me J' Girls like guys J' Guys like girls J' When they clash J' Girls dig boys Roll up the window. Look,Bflan, we were friends once. You know, we used to do things together, but that's not gonna happen anymore. I went to a hospital. I'm better now. You see, when I broke my leg, uh, they took an X-ray, to see if it was fixed. When it was, they, uh, took off the cast and then sent me home. But, you went to a mental hospital with a broken mind. Now there's no way they can just take a picture and see if that's okay. They just have to guess. What are you so afraid of? I can forgive you. Brian, old buddy, hmm, let me make one thing clear. Leave Paula and me alone, hmm? Dwight, come on! 'Hmm? Hmm? Check it out. I'm the district attorney. Hmm? Take it off. Oh he won't mind. J' I love you, beyond that walk J' And past the times and all his talk J' Lay your breast - Your father, your father's a little bigger than I am. But of course, I'm much bigger where it really counts. No, no. Not until your grades improve. At that rate, we'll never do it. J' Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh Attention, faculty and students, this is Mr. Dante. I want to thank the person responsible for the obscene caricature of me in the new wing lavatory. You were very generous with your portrayal, but in the future, I do wish that you would restrict your talents to the art class. I don't, I don't want you to do this. Don't tell me yourjealous. It's art. Class is about to start. Shouldn't you be bouncing a ball somewhere. You like boys, don't you? Nope. Now get outta here. I want you all to be mature about this. No laughing or snickering. What are we gonna do today? - Action poses, the dynamics of muscle in relation to the form. For example, say Paula was reaching for an apple. What should I do? Bend over and pick it up. Stay in that position. Do you see the different muscle groups? They enlarge to facilitate the movement. Can you see the stretching, the definition? What are you doing back there? You, come here. Oh, you want to be in my art class? I'll put you in my art class. We can always use another model. Here, hold it high, and Paula, you reach for it. Way UP! Up! Now, see how the centerline is straight, from head to toe? The muscles are tense. This is all here. - This is your last chance to purchase tickets for tomorrow's basketball game. - What if I come down with rickets or lupus or have a grand mal seizure, is the ticket refundable? It's only 50 cents. It's not the 50 cents. It's the principle. - I am the principal, and I say unless you buy a ticket, you will be clapping erasers until your hair turns gray. I'll, uh, have two. Thanks for the sale. - Ooh, I'm just trying to drum up a little school spirit. That's all. Well, you're doing great. - You know, flattery will get you everywhere. Stop by my office, would you? Why? It's a surprise. Yeah. Uh, you scheduled to work in the office, this week? I'll be in, tomorrow. - Well, I have an appointment with the bunion doctor, so I won't be here. The files will be locked. Oh, no problem, I have my key. _ okay- On the floor. Try it on. I'll turn around. - Mr. Dante, you'll see me tomorrow. I can't wait. Just sign this. It says that you will take good care of the uniforms. Oh you know I will. Oh thank you, Mr. Dante. I'm never gonna forget this. Neither will I. Wait! Help, wait! Help! Help! Love you! Oh God. What are you doing in my car? Hmm, kissing you? You should be home studying. Studying? So what'd the principal want, hmm? - He wanted to give me the new cheerleading uniforms. Cool, cool, let's drive. Let's just get out of here, hmm? I can't. Why? - I got homework. It's due tomorrow. So you do it tomorrow. We'll get a six-pack. We'll celebrate. I'm sorry. It's, it's just that schoolwork's more important, right now. - Schoolwork is more important, right now? You know, that sounds like something your father would say. I'm out of here. Dwight, come on, don't be mad. Hey, I don't get mad. I get even. Yeah, he's up. He scores! Hey! Hey, Shultz. Come here! Come on, come on! I need to get my math book. You know, book, read, book. Book. The thing with pages? Yeah. Never saw one. The school is closed. Okay, Shultz, come on. I have to get this book. I will fail my class if I do not get this book. Shultz! Shultz, come back! Shultz! Asshole! - What's the matter, Shultz won't let you in? No. Here, give me that. - Fuck it. Let's just get a beer. - Let's do it. Come on! - Ah, beer! Woo! Where there's art, there's dirt. J' Oh, oh no J' Oh, oh J' Straight you carved into a crack J' Initials knifed in a tabletop J' But love, love, oh, oh J' But love, oh, oh, oh Paula, open up! It's us. Hello, yoo-hoo! All right. Oh beer and ice cream. Ice cream and beer. Hey, guys, I'm studying. We want something. - I will give you a kiss, but then go. Well, I'll take a kiss, but what we really want is the key to the school files. - I can't, I can't give this to you. They, they gave me this key, because I'm responsible. - We just want to see what's in Brian Wood's files. Come on, aren't you curious, hmm? Look, you have my solemn word. We'll be in and out in 10 minutes. No one will ever know. Just be our little secret, hmm? I don't know. I really don't know. - Hey, come on, Dwight, give her some incentive. Let her have your ring. - Uh, nobody gets my family ring. - Is it worth seeing the file, hmm? - Just give her the stupid ring, man. J' Oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh-oh J' Oh, for love, oh, oh Yeah. Hmm. Come with us. - No. Come with us. - No way. You sure now? Yes. - Positive? No - Huh? Goodbye. - Bye. I got shotgun. - Come on, let's blow Dodge. - Kind of hard to study without these. You are such a jerk. All right, move it out. Like some beer? - No. Some ice cream? - No. J' Girls dig guys Aw, what a shame. Shultz will have to fix it. Pigs? Boys locker room? Smells like something died in here. Spot the enemy. Take aim. Squeeze the trigger. Retreat. Smoke a joint. - They just put this here to stop you. Man. - Get in there. - Pulled off my eyebrow. Ladies first. Why, thank you. No, I said ladies first. ' UP yours. Ta-da! J' Duh, duh, duh, duh-duh-duh Ready? Come on, let's go, let's go, come on, come on. - Wait, Dwight, what if Shultz catches us? Shh. - Shh. He's trashed. Uburov, Victor, Weldon, Woods. All right. - Brian Woods. I heard he was a cannibal. - Oh how could he eat another person? With a knife and a fork, oh. Student Brian Woods, age 17, readmitted to school September 5th, 1988, dah-dah, dah-dah, dah-dah-dah-dah. See medical report? - You know, if Brian is a cannibal, what do you think his favorite part of the body is? - Breasts, he likes that white meat. - Might I add, yours are big enough to feed a family of four. Reason for admittance, violent schizophrenic. Treatment, electroconvulsive therapy. - What's electroconvulsive therapy? Shock treatment, man. We got to go. No, we don't. I have a lot more to find out about Mr. Brian Woods. Here's mine. Gary, check this out. Put it back, Dwight, come on. - He got shocked every day he was in the hospital. Put it back. Yeah, I'm gonna change my IQ. Every single day. How could they do that to him? Is 300 too high? - And then they suddenly released him. 75 Watts? Is that all they did to him? My stereo gets more than 75 Watts. This is the good stuff. Wait. Good morning, class. Today, we're going to study the relationship between time, distance and speed. Space over time equals speed, because time is space divided by speed. Do you understand? Any questions? Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah! Now, a train leaves Chicago at seven, heading for Boston. It goes 50 miles an hour. How long does it take the train to arrive at its destination if Boston is hypothetically Dwight. Look at the answer on your paper? Uh, 75 Watts, sir. - What were you doing, last night, Dwight, while you were supposed to be completing your homework? Well, Mr. Glynn, you know, I tried to get my book, but that janitor- - The janitor, ah, the homework-eating dog. That's another zero in my grade book. One more, you fail the class. - Mr. Glynn, seriously, I tried. - Save it! Who has the answer? Is it eight hours? Eight, yes, very good. Quiet, class! Quiet! There isn't a species of bird or animal out here that I can't identify. Mother Nature talks to you. Help! - Sounds like Mother Nature has cramps. - That was the cry of a bullfrog making a lonely cry for its mate. Ah, ah, ah! Help. Help. J' Oh, oh, oh, oh J' Oh, oh, oh, oh What the hell do you want? - I knew I'd find you guys doing something like this. Hey, Mr. lngalls, they're over here. - No, don't tell him. Mr. Nicholson. - Hi, Dad. This is my son. Dwight, this is Mr. Nicholson. He's from the university. He's here to scout you for that basketball scholarship. I don't have to tell you it took a lot of talking to get him to come down to see you. - My men are on the court for practice at least one hour before each game. Seems like your son wants to practice something else. No, sir, no, sir. Dwight was just going inside, weren't you, son? Yes, sir, yes, sir. Why don't we go on in? Bitch. Paula. Paula. Paula! Paula, I've been thinking about you. Oh good luck. Thank you, Mr. Dante. Do a cheer for me. I bet he kisses like a lizard. Okay, girls, let's hurry up! The stands are packed. Come on, fvvit, fvvit. - Our team isn't that great, right? Right. - This should give the fans something better to cheer about. You're unbelievable. She isn't wearing panties. Let's g0! Break! Over here! How's business? - The uniforms look great from down here. Thanks, Gary. What is he doing down there? - Oh he looks for change that people drop out of their pockets, and he looks up girls' skirts. Stop! Let's g0! Go, Dwight, go! G0, Dwight, go! Give me the ball! To me! Shit. Go, Dwight, go! G0, Dwight, go! G0, Dwight, go! Go, go, go! GO, gQ! Get him, get him! No, wait. - Excuse me. Excuse me, excuse me. - Wait, wait, wait. Mr. Nicholson, wait, wait, wait. - Do you mind? - Give him another chance. What do you think you're doing? You're supposed to use your head not your fists, you little idiot! Your scholarship just walked out the door. Who's your mystery date? Ooh, Gary's back. Not so hard. Eight, seven, six. Ooh, I like that. - Five! Foufl Three! TWo! Qne! Hi, you. _ H?Y- Who won? Didn't you watch? Nah. I've been waitin' for ya. Is your father still gone? Yeah. Why don't you just take me home? I got to study. _ okay- What kind of depraved... Okay, now we work on brakes. Come on, okay. - Don't touch a thing unless I'm down here watching. - Your brakes may need a little adjustment. So adjust them. - So have you worked on your car much? - No, I haven't been underneath a car in a long time. How come? Hey, I just polish the outside. - Well, that's where the problem is. You know, I used to like workin' on cars with you. Yeah. - Yeah, remember the time under my dad's car? We took that part out, didn't put it back in. - Well, we were just fooling around. I wasn't fooling around. I never said a word about it. - Well, that was, that was a long time ago, Brian. - I'll never forget what you taught me. When you use a screwdriver, it's always - righty tighty, lefty loosey. - Right tighty, lefty loosey. Jeez, you remember that? I never forget. - What time does the train get there? I called Colleen's mother. They can't find them anywhere. Dwight. I'm sure it's nothing. Then where are they? - What time does the train get there, Dwight? - Mr. Glynn, can't you ever give Dwight a break? - Yeah, can ljust have one private moment about something very- Get out, both of you! Tell it to Mrs. Knocht. Out, both of you! Once friends, always friends? Shut up. Dwight lngalls? Let's go. - When you're in there with Mrs. Knocht, just think about her mustache, and you'll be okay. Asshole teachers. Brian Woods! Come on, let's go. You know why you were sent down here, don't you? I was disrespectful. - None of your teachers want you in their classrooms. Who doesn't want me? - Oh I've got notes from your gym teacher, from your art teacher and now from your math teacher, saying you're uncooperative, disruptive- Those are lies. You interrupted me. But those are lies. - Are you saying that your teachers are liars? What do you think? - I think you're like every other teenager who's sat in that chair. You believe that the adult world has colluded to cause you harm when nothing could be further from the truth. We want to help you take your mind and shape it. We want to put our values and virtues in your bodies so that we the teachers can live on in future generations. Are you willing to accept what we have to give you? I'd rather suck donkey dick. As of today, you're suspended. Scraping the scales off society. Hey, hey, you! You goddamned kids, you think you own the place. Get off of my floor with those shoes. I'm sorry. We'll go around. - Sorry doesn't get the skid marks off. Big deal. You're bugs. There is a time to be real and a time for manners. I'm gonna teach you to say please and thank you and how to survive in this shithouse. I'm the only teacher that you'll remember. I'm the custodian of your fucking destiny. Right. That man is fried. - So what are you gonna do this afternoon? Math. You're gonna do homework? - Well, I ain't got no basketball scholarship. So now I got to get in school by using my brain. Hey, what's going on? What do you want? What, what do you want? Let go of me! Mrs. Knocht. Do something! You did it. He's the killer. Paula, get the police! Stop! Hold it! Hold it! What are you doing? - Brian Woods, Brian Woods, surrender. We know you're in there, Brian Woods. Give yourself up. Go ahead. Positive ID. 10-fou r. - If the kid's in here, we'll bring him out. Let 'em go. Get help! Get help! Help. Get help. Help. Help! Do you understand English? Help! Help! Quiet! The principal Mr. Dante. Take a look at this! This is a disaster. Please, everyone, stay calm. The police are doing everything they can. Calm? Yes. Calm. Calm? Kids are missing. A teacher's missing. Mrs. Knocht is dead. If we stay calm, we'll all be dead. We need action. Please. Let's hear what my son saw. - Please. - Tell everyone what you saw. We all must remain calm. What did you see? There was blood everywhere! There was blood on Brian Woods' hands. Stop it, Mr. lngalls. Now you are creating a mob. Hmm. Hmm, hmm. -Animals. " Bang! Bang- I think you'd better go home. - Ladies and gentlemen of the jury, I will do everything in my power to send Brian Woods away where he can do more damage. In light of his actions, his worth as a human being has been called into question. For this human scum, no, how 'bout plague, blight, vermin? Vermin, I like vermin. Okay, for this vermin, I suggest nothing short of permanent confinement in a state mental hospital, someplace where they can simply throw away the key. - Attention, faculty and students. To be or not to be. This is Mr. Dante. - What kind of lousy answer's that, huh? Forget it, Dwight. I gotta get some grades somehow. - You have all heard of the tragic death of our beloved vice principal Mrs. Knocht. As yet, the murderer has not been captured. The police are doing everything in their power. - Man, Brian is in Missouri by now. The police suck. - Tomorrow, there will be a memorial service at Holy Baptist at El Conchaca, to show our love for Mrs. Knocht, who was cut down in the line of duty. What's this? It's the truth. - Chubby, let's have the stage for a few. No problem. - Okay? Check out on 248. - "The suspect was involved in an early morning argument "With his father." Brian's father. - "Got into his car and started for work." 8:29. - "Woods Sr. applied his brakes, but nothing happened. "He pounded on the pedal, but his foot went to the floor." "Why, Officer?" "His brake lines had been cut." 8:29 and 30 seconds? - "Out of control, Woods Sr. slams "into the gas station." 8:30 exactly? - "Woods Sr., Brian's father, was dead." "When you arrested the suspect, "did he say who taught him to cut brake lines?" - Paula, I think we've read enough. - Who taught him to cut brake lines? "A friend. "A friend taught him." - "Did he say specifically which friend?" - "He said, 'You don't betray a friend."' What was that? I'm scared. To be or not to be. Eat me, Dwight. Yes. - Oh come on, you guys, you know better. I asked her if you did. Tilt it a little bit. Keep your elbow straight. Oh shoot. That's all right, just pull it straight back, whoa! Man, huh? Just because some loon goes around killing doesn't mean you have the day off. Where are your clothes? I already put 'em in the car, but it's just bows and arrows. - You can't participate in class without 'em. All right, I don't mind. Well, I do, Mister. I want to see you here, tomorrow, with your gym gear on. We'll have a private little gym class together, just the two of us. - Tomorrow is Mrs. Knocht's memorial service. I am 90mg- Mrs. Knocht? I wouldn't cross the street for that old rag, and you wouldn't either, Dwight. You don't show tomorrow, you fail. You fail gym class, you don't get your diploma. No diploma, no future, no nothin'! Class, get your bows. Now! Dwight! Help me. Help. Have you been drinking? I don't now. Can't remember that far back. Fuckin' teachers, they want to run my life. It's in your imagination. - Don't you think the two of us make the perfect couple. ' Stop it! I gotta go to school tomorrow. First, sleep it off. Here? No, not here. Go home. Dwight! Hi. I'm not gonna hurt you. I promise, just don't scream. Please don't kill me. Kill you? I'm not gonna kill you. I need you to help me. Help you do what? Help me find the killer. What? I didn't kill Mrs. Knocht. I need you to help me find whoever did. I don't believe you. Don't, please. Don't. Is that what you really believe? Come on, take 'em. Go on! Stab me, stab me if you think I'm the killer. Because if you don't, it's my word against everyone else's. So go on, stab me, kill me. Kill me if you think I did it. Don't touch me. You probably heard that I killed my father. Yeah. I didn't love him. But I didn't want to see him dead, either, just hurt, badly hurt. Considering how he treated my mother and me, that was generous. When Mrs. Knocht was... You ran. - I'm strange, right, demented, deranged? They'd love to hang me for that woman's death. - What about Colleen, Gary, the art teacher? What about them? They're missing. Great. More people dead. They'll blame those on me, too. Are you telling me the truth? I'm trying. Hello. Hello? - You know what Coach Harris can do with his gym class? He can shove them so far up they come out of his fucking nose. Dwight, you got to calm down. I'm just gettin' started. Dwight! Hello? I found some clothes. Dwight sounded crazy. We got to help him. And sacrifice myself for Dwight? I already did that once. Paula, look at this. I can't. It's a copy of the murder. Look, you could even see part of his hand. Oh my God. What? That ring belongs to the killer. I know. That ring belongs to Dwight. We got to stop him. We must help him. I'll do it for you, Paula, not Dwight. Glad to see you made it, Dwight. Go change. Fuck you. Fuck you. And fuck you! Fuck you, too. - You can't talk to students like that. Fuck you. Now suit up. I'll be back. Murderer! You're wrong! Paula, let me in! Brian! Brian, get out of the school! Oh! Paula? This is a dangerous place for a pretty girl like you. It's Dwight. He's after me. - You two shouldn't be playing games in here. - No, you don't understand. Brian is not the killer. It's Dwight. Dwight is the killer. He killed Mrs. Knocht. - What? - He killed Colleen, Colleen and Gary. J' Oh, oh, oh J' Man talk, give me that J' Man talk J' Give me that J' Man talk J' Give me that J' Man talk He knows we're in here. J' Give me that J' Man talk J' Give me that J' Man talk There. J' All aboard, all aboard for the party line J' He knows the streets are bad J' He's got an automatic J' He ain't J' He says you, yeah, you J' I said you, I think you better come, too I think we're safe in here. Which door? Get it right or die. A train leaves Chicago at eight, heading east. Another train leaves Boston heading west, at eight. At what time do the trains collide? X equals one or two? - You know what it means, don't you? Oh my God. The answer's in the problem. Do it. Hurry. - Yes, yes, set it up. A train leaves Chicago. Distance divided by speed. - Hurry! - Distance divided by speed. Damn. Do it, hurry! - I can't think. Carry, you add distance and- - Are you sure that the- - Don't talk to me. I can't concentrate. You're the math teacher. Just do it! I am not prepared. Subtract. Subtract, yes, yes, I've got it. I've got it. X equals one. The trains will collide at 1 a.m. That's the door over there, on the one. Are you sure? Yes, of course I'm sure. Now let's go. There, you see? I was able to figure it out. Now aren't you glad I'm a teacher. Wrong door! He didn't account for the difference in time zones. Da-dun, dad-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun, da-dun! He shoots, he scores, yeah! I'm better than Dwight. But you knew that already, didn't you? So how 'bout it? Do you want to go out with me? Please. Leave me alone. Alone? That's how I spent the last five years of my life, courtesy of your father. Please. - Do you know that your father was the first person to call me a murderer. Me, a murderer? Well, I thought about that. I was a murderer. It wasn't as prestigious as being a doctor or a lawyer, but the hours were good. And so I thought, why not be the best in my profession, like your father was in his? How could I perfect the art of killing, or better yet, take the ultimate professional challenge and kill beyond the confinements of time or space? How could I kill people in the past, the future or change the course of history forever? Why are you doing this? I like you, Paula. Really, I do. So don't take it personally when I kill you. I'm just doing myjob, because,because, J' I'm one hell of a guy J' A Yankee doodle J' Kill J' Or die Help, nap! Help! Help! - Help! Help! Wet the floor! Why? - Just do it! The sodium. This is sodium. Remember, sodium explodes in contact with water. Get back here! When Brian comes in, we'll blow him to pieces. - You're a Yankee Doodle Dandy, too. You, you too must kill or die. Time to burn. - You shouldn't have been so late for class, Dwight. That wasn't sodium. It was just a rock. Nice try, though. Paula, get his plug! Paula! - You guys make such a good couple. I'd like to see more of you over there and over there. Catch! Where are you? Bastard! Come on! You taught me. Now I'll teach you. Teach me what? Killing. You're just like me, Dwight. You're a killer. But you haven't had the opportunity yet. So what do you say, sport? Now's a good time to start. Kill her and you live. I promise, one bro to another. Do it! Go on! What a loser! What a loser.
