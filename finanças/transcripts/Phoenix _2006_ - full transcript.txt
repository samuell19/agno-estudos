(waves crashing) ("Gourmet Food, Vintage Wine & You" by Phil Dutra) (phone ringing) - [Voiceover] It's Ken Sparks, you missed me, leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Hey Ken, it's me. Um, yeah I know you don't like me to call you but... It's late. Let me know, if you're flying right now or whatever. I mean, yeah, call me. - What the fuck does he think 70 million means? - Yeah, but I already did the paperwork. He's a fucking bastard! Now this is bullshit. - [Voiceover] Well don't get mad at me, this is your deal. I think you better call the bank right away because this is, I think the whole thing is awful. - This just doesn't make any sense. What else did he say? Nothing, yeah I know. - [Voiceover] We could just put it on hold just temporarily 'til we get it all figured out. The banks not putting any of the money thru. Nothing's gotten funded, and nobody has gotten-- - I've got the whole thing lined up, we can't stop now. I just can't believe it. What else did he say? I knew I should've went with my gut on this. But Larry, he was positive it would all work out. Now this is total bullshit. No, we can sue him! It just makes no sense. You tell him then, if he decides he's really out, then he's in a world of shit. Call me back, okay? I can be there in an hour. Yeah, I know. No, I'm going to Chicago next week. You know I can't talk about that right now. Just call me back. Okay then. Shit. California? - A Chilean. - Nice, I missed you. - Yeah? - Of course. - Something happen to the deal? - Probably. - I have dinner going. - Smells good. - I had a bath ready too, but it's probably cold by now. Dinner will be ready in 30 minutes. (water splashing) Shit. - Is it supposed to look like that? - Funny. I just wanted it to be special for you. - Let me take you some place special. I got you a present. I know you think I forgot, I didn't. - What is it? - Open it. - Wow. - It's top designer, real piece of art. - This is really nice. - You should get nice things. It shows class. - Thank you Kenneth. - Happy birthday Dylan. - Stop, you're spoiling me. - Everyone needs some indulgence. - I'm just glad you're back. You know, the week gets so long sometimes. - What if I was around more? - Don't. - [Ken] I'm serious. - You better be, cause it's not funny. - This thing is wrapping up in Phoenix. I can be in L.A. an extra couple days a week. - You mean move in? - Maybe. - You know, we wouldn't have to do this all the time, I can cook and all that. - We can get a maid. - You know, it would be great. We can have dinner parties, your friends can meet my friends. We can get a dog. When? When will you know? - Things are kinda tricky down there but, I think I'm almost in the clear. A couple months maybe. - That's just great Kenny. You made my night. - Happy birthday. (waves crashing) That counts as your coffee cigarette. - There's a sex cigarette. - I thought you were quitting anyway. - Mmm, you always think that. - It's because you always tell me that. - You keep telling yourself that. - Mhm. You smokin' in Phoenix? - Yes. How's that? - Better. So, what do you wanna do today? - Eat. - You want me to make breakfast? - Nah, we'll go out. - What? (laughing) Stop! Stop. (phone ringing) You aren't gonna answer that. - It's the incredible Mr. Sparks speaking. Yeah? Shit. What did Larry say? No, of course I'm pissed. Okay then, bye. What are my things doing in here? I told you I didn't want you to put my things in your closet. - I just hung them up. - I have everything organized the way I want it in my suitcase. - It's not a big deal, I made room for you. How do you make this call, Dylan? - Okay, I won't put them in there. - I have to go. - What? Why? - Investors backed out. All went to shit. - So then why are you leaving now? Can't it wait 'til Monday? - No it can't. - Kenneth, you said you'd go to my party. I can't make anymore excuses for you. - So don't. - Why are you taking this out on me? - It's not all about you. I spent three years on this land deal. It's all gone. - I'm going with you. - You can't. - [Dylan] I can do whatever I want. - You're not going. - You promised to spend my birthday with me. So we'll do it in Phoenix. - You're complicating everything here, Dylan. Making everything we do fucking complicated. - It's just one day. - You're not going. - Are you going back on your word? Cause that would make you a liar. - Okay, I'll meet your friends, just not this weekend. - You say that every weekend. - You had a good birthday. We had dinner, sex. I got you an expensive gift, what more do I have to do? - Be a part of my life! - Now you're just getting dramatic. - You know, I don't want your stupid gifts, take it back! (clay shattering) - You're a child, you know that? You don't treat art this way. Why do we have to fight every time? - Cause you keep making promises that you never intend to keep. - I do intend to. You just don't appreciate that. I can probably get a standby. I'll make a reservation for the airport. - I don't want you to leave like this. - I gotta go. Really. I gotta clean up this mess I've made. - Will you call me when you get in? - Do you want me to? - Of course. If you don't, I'll worry. - You don't have to worry about me. - Then my birthday? - I promise. (relaxing guitar music) (phone buzzing) - [Voiceover] Hey stud, what's up? Is your man there? Oh, I can't wait to meet him. Yes, I'm coming for Sunday night. Everyone is going to be there, so you can show him off all night. You know how you are. Anyway, call me back. Ciao. (plane flying overhead) - [Voiceover] Flight 72 now arriving, Gate 7. Luggage for Flight 702 will be picked up at Baggage Claim 3. (dramatic instrumental music) (phone ringing) - Mod Resort. Sure, anytime. Thanks. Buh-bye. - Hi, um. I'm surprising my friend. Well, my boyfriend actually. I think he's staying here? - Well, you don't have to check in with me you can go straight to the room. - But I don't know what his room number is. - You know what, I'm sorry I just can't help you with that. - Look, I know it's not something you normally do, it's just that I don't want to ruin the surprise and call him. - I just can't help you, I'm sorry. - Can you at least tell me if he's staying here? His name is Kenneth Sparks. - Kenneth Sparks. Okay, let me check that for you. He is registered here. - Have you seen him? He was supposed to come back here last night. - Uh, no I haven't. I only work mornings. (phone ringing) - I guess he's at work. - I don't know. Mod Resort. Hi. Yes, when would you like to come? - Can I leave a massage? - Can you just hold on one second please? - Sure. - The reservation? For two. July 16th? Perfect. Your name please? - Thank you. - You're welcome. - [Voiceover] It's Ken Sparks you missed me, leave me a message and I'll get back to you as soon as I can. - Hi, it's me. Listen, I just wanted to say that I didn't like the way we left things, so. I'm in Phoenix, yeah. So, surprise! I'm here. Well, um, I know you're busy but well, I didn't want to ruin the surprise and all by calling but, I also didn't wanna sit outside your hotel room all day waiting. So, okay well when you get a chance give me a call. Alright, love you. Uh yes, do you have a number for Claymakers in Phoenix? - [Voiceover] Can I help you? - Uh, yeah hi. Your stuff is great. - Those are just souvenirs. Are you looking for something in particular? - Uh, no I actually came to get mine fixed. - You have one of my pieces? - Uh, yeah. But I broke it accidentally. I tried glueing it. - Who gave you this? - A friend, my boyfriend actually. He gave it to me for my birthday. - This is one of a kind. - He spoils me, but I don't ask him to. - How long have you two been together? - A year, almost. He's gonna move in as soon as he wraps everything up here in Phoenix. - You're meeting him here? - At the Mod Resort. I'm surprising him. He doesn't even know I'm here. So, do you think you can fix it? - It's destroyed. - Oh, well maybe I can just buy another one then. - Sorry, I'm fresh out. - What about those up there though? - All spoken for, I'm sorry I can't help you. - Oh, okay. Well, um. Thank you for your time. Hey, it's me. I was out wandering. I like Phoenix. Well, I'm on my way back to the hotel room now. I guess you got sidetracked out here somewhere. Alright well, I'm on my cell. Give me a call. Love you, bye. - Hello, are you checking in? - Hi, um. Yeah, you know what? I just flew in and I lost my key to the room. - Do you have I.D.? - Actually it was in my wallet, it got stolen. The key and my I.D. - Oh boy, okay. - What's your name? - Uh, Ken. Kenneth Sparks. - Oh, Room 103? - That's me. - There's a 50 dollar lost key charge. - Could you bill that to my room? - [Voiceover] I think so. - Great. - Okay. Don't lose it. - Perfect. - Hey, I'm sorry it's just its my first shift alone. - Oh that's okay, you're doing a great job. - Oh, you have a got a message. Oh, a guy seems worried. You should call him. - Thanks a lot. - Okay. - Hi so, I don't know where you are, I thought you were coming back here to Phoenix. I hope you're okay. Alright well, it's late now and I'm really worried so, as soon as you get this, will you call me? Alright, bye. Yes, I need to call the police. No injuries, a missing person. Thank you. - He came right into my garage and said he was surprising Ken. - Oh, honey. - That's an understatement. - Did you call Ken? - Five times. No answer. - He's probably too scared to face you. Telling your boyfriend you have a boyfriend isn't as easy as it sounds. - It's just a bump in the road. You'll have a fight, you'll talk it out, you'll work through it. - I just don't want to share him. - What are you sharing? He comes home to you. Everything else is just sex. - I'm not stupid, am I Lewis? I mean you didn't see it coming either, right? - You must've known something. - I guess, sometimes. But I never thought he'd really do it. - Face it, you lost yourself in that man. If we didn't work together, we'd never see each other. - [Voiceover] That's not true. - So, what are you gonna do? - I don't know. Wait for him to come home I guess. - Oh, screw that. You go over to that fuckin' hotel and you bust his fuckin' ass. (knocking) - Hi I'm Detective Smith, responding to a missing persons call? - Yes, come in. - Did you call it in? - Yes. - Okay. - Have a seat. - Thank you. - I was supposed to meet him here, but he never showed up. - And this is Ken Sparks? - Yes. - Okay. And you are Dylan Wells? - That's correct. - Alright. Mr. Wells, when did you see him last? - Two days ago in L.A., he left my place to come back here. But I haven't seen him since. - Is this where he lives? This motel room? - I think so, this is the only address I have for him. - Okay. Does he have any relatives in the area? Somewhere else he might've gone? Friends? - I don't really know any of his family. He usually comes to see me in L.A. This is my first time here. - How about where he works? - He has this big real estate deal going on right now, but I think it's falling apart. - Arizona's a pretty big place, Mr. Wells. Do you know the name of the company or the project? - No. - Why do you think something happened to him? - Well, he was yelling at somebody when he left my place and it kinda got loud, and he sounded really angry. And so did the other person. - I'll make a couple of phone calls, see what turns up, but this is probably just a misunderstanding. So, don't worry okay? - Hi. - Where's Ken? - He's not here. - That's bullshit, move. - Hey. - Alright, let's just get this over with. Where is he? - Who are you? How do you know ken? - Just don't. I want to talk to Ken. - So do I. - When's he coming back? Because I'll wait. - I think you should leave. - I'm not going anywhere. - I'll call the police. - Knock it off. You know I'm his husband. - That's ridiculous. - I already know who you are. - I don't believe you. - I don't give a fuck what you believe. - Then you must know where to find him. - He was supposed to be here. - He's missing. - What does that mean? - He left L.A. two days ago and I haven't see him since. - Doesn't mean he's missing. - Then where else could he be? - I don't know, I haven't looked anywhere else. - Do you know where he works? - Of course I do. - Wait, I'm going with you. - Like hell you are. - No, I want him to say it to my face. - You're right, you should hear it from him. - [Dylan] Why didn't you say something yesterday? - This is between Ken and I. It has nothing to do with you. - We'll see about that. - Yeah, keep that hope alive. So how did it work? You fly in here, you and Ken meet at the hotel, and I think he's in L.A. the whole time? - I told you yesterday that I've never been here before. - I bet. - Did you know about me? Before yesterday? - What do you think? - What's your name? - [Voiceover] What? - Your name. What's your name? - What's your name? - Dylan. - Demetrius. He should be here, this is what he's been working on. It was supposed to be a development townhouses. - Whoa ho ho ho, whoa. Can I help you? - Where is everybody? - Stopped getting paid, so they stopped working. - Have you seen this guy around? - Yeah, I've seen him. - When? - About a week ago. Why, you know where he is? - No, we were hoping that you could tell us that. - Some guys from the bank are wondering the same thing. What, he owes you money too? - [Dylan] Something like that. - Sorry, couldn't help you. - Thanks. - No problem. - [Dylan] I heard him threatening somebody before he left. - [Demetrius] Sounds like Ken. - Who's Larry? You think he would've done something bad to him? - Ken's the bulldog. Larry does whatever Ken wants. - Then where else would he be? - His parents maybe. - You know he never talked to me about his family. - I have their phone number at home. - How long have you two been together? - Seven years. I'll be right back. - Okay. (phone ringing) Hello? Did you find him? Well is he okay? What does that mean? But you talked to him, you actually talked to him? Hold on a second. There's somebody else here that should hear this, hold on. - What's going on? - It's the police. - Hello? Yeah, I'm his partner. He's not missing. Well, where is he? What's he doing in Chicago? Well how do I find him? No, I have a right to know, that's bullshit. He doesn't. Thanks. Why'd you give me the phone? - That's what I'd want if it were the other way around. - You hungry? - Aren't you gonna call him? - No. - I don't understand, so... He just left, he's not missing? - Did he really say he was gonna move in with you? - He said he wanted to. - You know, forget it. I don't wanna know. - I'm sorry. - It's a shitty thing he's doing to you. - You know, I thought he was really hurt. Or worse. Why he couldn't just say what he wanted or what he didn't want? Or whatever. I was really worried. This is good. I didn't realize how hungry I was. Thanks. - I'm a chef. I'm a cook, actually. Funny thing is, that's how we met. I was subbing for a sick waiter the night he came to the restaurant. What do you do? - I'm a nurse. - Really? Hmph, that surprises me. - Why? - Just, you seem so young. - I'm an LVN right now, still studying being an RN. - Is that how you guys met? - The beach. I like to surf sometimes. - Ken's always flicking his butts on the ground. Keeps telling me he's gonna quit. - Me too. - I made it for Ken. I don't know why he took it with him. - I guess to give it to me. - I guess so. - Sorry. I didn't mean it like that. - No, you're probably right. I see why he likes you. You're nice. - Thanks. - I mean if you were a jerk, it would be easy to hate you. But you're a nurse for fuck's sake, who could hate a nurse? - Sorry. - Don't be so damn sorry, it's not your fault. - Has he cheated on you before? - No. Well, I'd like to say no. - I couldn't imagine cheating. Have you cheated on him? - Never. Thought about it. About a million times. - So what stopped you? - Too complicated. Or maybe I'm just too simple for it. - Sounds like you regret it. - Sometimes. I mean, it's hard to resist when someone's looking at you like that. Excitement that's gone out of your relationship. Kind of makes you feel new again. - You know, every seven years you're a whole new person? - What? - Basically, the cells that you start out with they divide and they divide, and then die. And then you're basically this whole new set of cells just walking around on the planet. Basically a whole new person. - Good morning. - Just a little hungover. - Thought you could use some coffee after last night. - Oh, that would be great, thanks. - Careful, it's hotter. If you feel like walking it off, there's a place I like to go when I need to think. I could use the company. - Sure. - [Demetrius] We used to come up here all the time. - Ah, it's beautiful. - Yeah. I'd forgotten. What made you want to become a nurse? - When I was 14, I tried picking up a baby rattlesnake and it bit me. Stupid, huh. So they had to rush me to the hospital where they gave me a dose of anti-venom. I was pretty scared. But there was this one nurse that just kept talking to me asking me all these questions about my life, about my family, you know which was really nice. Because when you're 14, no one really cares about you. But after the initial shock wore off, all I wanted to do was go to sleep. But she just kept talking to me and wouldn't let me. What I didn't know at the time was that the anti-venom could actually make your heart stop beating within the first 24 hours. She wasn't just keeping me awake, she was keeping me alive. I guess I just want to do that for other people. Help them through their toughest times. You know, make them not scared. Because someone did that for me. - Wow. - I usually just say it's because I like helping people. - No, I'm glad you told me. Ken made fun of you, didn't he? - Ken doesn't take anything seriously. Especially me. - Did you two fight? - It was his favorite pastime I think. Sometimes he wouldn't let up, and I'd lose it. He could never handle that. - You know, he was always pressuring me to be a doctor. It was like nothing was ever good enough for him. - He wants me to buy the restaurant, make it a chain. Just because I want to be a cook, doesn't mean I'm an underachiever. - Well, there's definitely more to life than work. - Did you know that Ken and I were poor when we first met? - I couldn't picture Ken without money. - The more money he made, the more money he wanted. The deals just kept getting bigger and bigger and we saw each other less and less. All I ever wanted was a husband and a house, and a job that I liked. I don't need all that money to make it mean anything. - I see why you two are together. You ground him. - I wish it were that simple. - Well, you must've worked something out to be together this long. - I love him. - You know my friends always complain that I get wrapped up in a guy too quickly. I guess I probably should've listened to them this time. - Be careful who you waste your youth on. - You have to follow your heart. - But your heart could get you in trouble. - I think you're just mad right now. - Maybe. - Were you in love with Ken? - You could only be in love once. - That's convenient. - Well, he has to be in love with me too. - Just because a person doesn't love you back, doesn't mean you don't love them. - Is that the way you love Ken? - You don't understand, this is complicated. - Well you know what? It doesn't seem all that complicated to me. I mean he cheated on you, and you should dump him. - You're not upset about what he did to you? - Oh of course I am, but I'll get over it. And you should too. - I can't even think about it. - Alright. Listen. Do you know how many guys would absolutely love to be with a guy like you? - Yeah right. - Seriously. You're wasting your time with him. - I wish I still had your optimism. - Come here. ("Oceans" by Vertigo Road) I can't believe Ken would throw all this away. - I don't wanna talk about Ken. - All I'm saying is that I can never take this for granted. - Nobody ever plans to. - I'm not giving up hope. I wanna fall in love, get married, have kids. - In front of our family and twenty of our closest friends. It's no guarantee. - Then why'd you marry him if you knew he wasn't the right guy? - He was the right guy, then. But you have to have room to change in a relationship. And sometimes the space you give somebody it becomes the space between you. - Not if you get through things together. Talk it out, ask questions. - The whole beginning is questions. That after a while you just don't ask. Because you don't want to hear the answers. - That's stupid. - It's true. - Ask me any question you want. - I don't wanna be cheered up. - Bullshit, go ahead. Ask me any question, I'll answer it. Come on. There's gotta be something you really wanna know about me that you haven't asked. - Did uh, did Ken let you fuck him? (laughing) - What? - You said any question. - Sometimes. If he had been drinking. But, why do you wanna know that? - Were you safe? - Not always. But I trusted him. - So did I. - Is that why you didn't wanna-- - Yeah. Partly, anyway. Did you like when Ken made love to you? - He was too rough most of the time. - Did you like our sex? - Ah, I created a monster. - I'm serious. - Yes, I did. ("Unwind" by Garrin Benfield) You know, this is finally starting to feel like an adventure. I love to travel. Guess I'd forgotten. I hadn't been out of L.A. since Ken. - What's the best place you've ever been? - Asheville, North Carolina. - Really? - Yeah, I went camping there. Skipped out early one year for spring break. It was practically still winter there. We took out all this food to cook over an open fire but, it was too windy and cold out. Peter finally got the fire lit and of course then it started to snow. It was like the universe was dead set against us having our breakfast. Peter just stood there defying the gods to ruin our pancakes. So then we moved into the tent because it wouldn't stop snowing. We had to huddle together to keep from freezing to death. I just had the best time. Hanging out, talking. - Was Peter your boyfriend? - He was a jerk. - So I take it it didn't work out then. - Obviously. - Just because it didn't work out doesn't mean he was a jerk. - Does to me. - Dylan, you guys shared an amazing time together. Why take that away from yourself? Or from him? - Because he never kept any of his promises. - But you had a great time, right? - Just that weekend. - Sometimes romance is just short. Doesn't mean it wasn't worth anything. And usually those are the ones you remember for the rest of your life. - No. He was a jerk. You know, it's kinda sexy how the clay molds in your hands. - It's been a long time since I made anything but those vases. - You know he yelled at me for breaking it? Yeah, he said that I was acting like a child and that I didn't know how to treat art. - He called it art? - [Dylan] Yeah. - That asshole. - I didn't really mean to break it. (chuckling) Well, maybe I did but... It was before I knew you made it. - It was the only thing I ever made for Ken. He didn't quite see the value in doing something that didn't make money. You know with Ken I make one statue and suddenly I'm Claymakers. I just want my garage back. - Maybe this is destiny. Look, if you wouldn't have started this business I would've never met you and, I don't know, maybe this whole thing with Ken was just to bring us together. - Seems like an awful lot of trouble to go through. - Well, that is how destiny works, isn't it? Hey, can I ask you something? - Sure. - Um, I was wondering if, well no pressure or anything but if, well I could call one of my friends at work and since if they'd be willing to cover my shifts. We can hang out a little bit longer. If you want. - If you want to, sure. - Yeah, okay. - [Voiceover] So, how are you holding up? - We're doing just fine. - We? - Be nice, he's been jilted too. - If you're into older men, I'm older than either one of these two. - Keep it in your pants, Gunther. - I'm just consoling him. - What, like you did those twins in Paris? - You slept with them too! - So, you guys aren't monogamous? (laughing) - Monogamy is only good for about one night. - Uh, what's the point of being in a relationship if you're not gonna be faithful? - Maybe infidelity can't be avoided? - Yeah, but you don't have to fuck around to make your relationship mean something. - Alright, wait a minute. So you're saying that you'll only sleep with people that you're gonna build a life with together? - Yes, basically. - Damn, you have met your clone. - To the young. So full of hope and dreams. If they weren't so hot, nobody would pay any attention to them at all. - Amen. Let's eat. (acoustic guitar music) - So what do you do for fun around here? - I'm doing it. - Reading the paper is not fun. - I get my coffee and my paper and I sit in bed and read it. I like it, it's fun for me. And I like to know what's going on in the world. - Boring. - It wouldn't hurt you to know a little bit more about what's going on. - Stuff is too depressing. Everyone has too many problems, and no one is gonna solve them. - Really? - No one's gonna change anyway, so who cares. - Some of us do. - Stop it. (laughing) I said stop it. - You're ticklish. - I hate to be tickled. Seriously. Stop it! Stop it! (laughing) Stop it! (laughing) - Okay, I'm sorry. Okay, I said I'm sorry, get off of me. - I said I hate to be tickled. - Okay, I get it. You don't have to be an asshole. What time will you be home? - I'm usually home around 11 or so. - Did you want to do something? I don't know what you normally do, but... - Uh, we can eat if you want. - Yeah. - Fine I'll bring something home from the restaurant then. - Okay. Sounds good. (acoustic guitar music) (thunderstorm and rain) I thought you'd be home at 11. - I said around 11. - I had a romantic evening all planned out. - Sometimes I work late. I can't always be home at a specific time. - Okay. - What the fuck is this? You saw him. You talked to him, didn't you? - No. - How could he get everything out of here without you seeing him? - I don't know, I wasn't here most of the day. - Why the fuck are you wearing his shirt? - I needed something nice to wear. - It doesn't belong to you. You think you could just come in here and take anything you want? - It's just a shirt. - Take it off. - What? - Take it the fuck off. Now! ("Annabeleigh" by The Waxfire) - Get off me! What's your problem? Get off me! - You can't replace him! (clay shattering) I'm pretty pathetic, huh? - It kills me that he has this hold over you. - You don't have as much invested. - I'm just glad that he's gone. So now you can move on. - It's not that easy, Dylan. - I'm falling in love with you. - Dylan. - You're so many things I'm looking for. - But not everything. - No, but some things you'll change about you, and some things I will change about me. We're not the same people forever. - People are basically the same, Dylan. You said so yourself, people don't change. Or won't. - I need some time to sort this out. Alone. - What about what's going on here? Between us? - You'll see. None of this was meant to be. - I think you're wrong. - I'm not. - Just tell me you have no feelings for me. Say it to my face. - I don't. Not the kind of feelings you need anyway. - I don't believe you. - You don't have a choice. - Hey. - Hey. - I was getting a rental car. - You don't have to rush off. - No, I know. But, I'm ready to go. Just not really ready to be back yet. - Sorry about last night. - Yeah, me too. - It wasn't your fault. You just got caught in the middle. - You gonna be okay? - Eventually. I'm gonna start slow. And burn everything he owns. - Do you think... - What? - Nevermind. - What about you? Are you gonna be alright? - It does hurt when... When you love someone and they don't love you back. - It's his loss. - Yeah it is. - Will you keep in touch? - Yeah, sure. - Cause I don't want to become another story like that Peter guy. - Well, I better go. - Dylan, wait. ("Back to One" by Jared Young) (waves crashing)
