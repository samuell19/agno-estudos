I flopped Kings. Pass. Yo, you in this or not? Nah, I fold. Come on, grandpa. You play your game and I'll play mine. You've been doing this shit all night. - Get in the pot or don't. - My house, my rules. I'll do what I want. - Can you please just go? - I will eventually. Please give me time. - Freaking amateurs. - Amateurs? He calls me an amateur, he calls you guys amateurs. I raise 500. Fold. I'm all in. Hey man, this place is a black hole for data because I am getting no signal right now. Shut up. Call. Everybody up! Against the wall, bitch. Did you not hear what I said? Hands up, bitch. What are you looking at? This is bullshit. Well you guys weren't very discrete about it. Left the door wide open. You guys are so smart. Let's go. Okay, what do we do now? I'm still getting no signal. I can try the emergency function. - It doesn't matter. - What do you mean? Well y'all would know if y'all wasn't a bunch of posers. I don't understand. You think all this money gonna get over with the cops? A friend of mine just got busted for the same shit. So we can't call the police? Do y'all wanna go to jail tonight? I seen them out there, I knew something was up. - It had to be one of y'all. - Whoa, whoa, whoa man. We're all here for the same reason, okay? What? They came in right after you pushed. - So you think it was me? - How do I know it wasn't? Are you kidding me? Did you not see I got punched? Plus I have a hand, see for yourself. - You. - What? - Hey, hey, hey, hey... - You. It wasn't me. You was on your phone this whole time. How do I know you didn't call 'em in? - Let him go, huh? - Shut the hell up. Weren't you the last one outside? What did you say? You were the last one outside. They said the door was open. How do we know it wasn't you? I play what I earn, not like y'all. ♪ Woah oh, I'm falling harder than I know ♪ ♪ I was all in faster here we go ♪ ♪ Now I'm running, running to survive ♪ ♪ You got me in overdrive ♪ ♪ I'm runnin' yeah you've done it ♪ ♪ I'm runnin' so fast, you love it ♪ ♪ I hope this day it never ends now ♪ ♪ Her pretty face has got me in overdrive ♪ You know that punch really hurt. Don't be such a baby. And what happened to hitting me in the face? You would've been expecting that. Your reaction was way more believable. Yeah, I'm pretty sure you bruised my stomach. It'll be fine before we do the next one. The next one? Hell yeah. That was so much more exciting than when I was hitting empty houses. I loved the looks on their faces. Hands up bitch, don't move. I had each of them by the balls and they couldn't do anything about it. You know, we can't keep hitting all of them. Not all at once. Gotta have time to clear the air. Word spreads around really quick with these guys. Oh, this is the movie I was telling you about. Her dancing is so pretty. Yeah, a lot more than yours. I'm a great dancer. Yeah well this doesn't count. You're such an asshole. I bet I could do a great routine that would blow you away. Try to get another game lined up. I wanna do this again real soon. Yeah, I'll see what I can find. We can do better. - Late night again? - Yep. What the hell is that? Calm down, it's water, something new I'm trying. I'm really trying, Allen. Take those. Yo yo. What are you doing letting this knucklehead sleep on the couch? I swear to God this guy snores louder than my mom. How's it going man, when did you get back? Doin' good, just got back a few weeks ago. - How you feeling? - Come on, look at me. It can't be too bad, at least finally this guy has started pulling his weight around here. - Shut up. - How's school? Oh it's going good, I graduate in the spring, just finished my internship and the guys tell me they'll have a software engineering gig lined up for me once I finish school. Start me out at 50K a year. Right on man, bet you got all the ladies lining up don't you? Oh you know me, I always got my pick. Hey, why don't you get Allen a job too? I thought you were gonna try to play... Dude. What? You're not playing cards again, are you? No. I got the perfect job for him. I'm thinking about making him my personal biatch. Oh yeah, yeah you're hilarious. Hey, you don't want none of this son. Get caught up and then come into my office. - Dude, can you be any later? - I'm sorry Tony. Okay first of all, stop with this Tony shit. The name is Anthony, all right? I'm not 22 livin' in Daddy's basement. I got kids, I got bills to pay. You need to be on time, got it? Start with section two. Look, Tony. December 16th, 32 minutes late. January 4th, 26 minutes late and I've got several other incidents over the past few months. Did you think I wasn't keeping track of all this? I can explain. Look Allen, you're a good kid and your work ethic has improved over the last couple of years but what good is it with all this continued foolishness? I don't like using my dad as an excuse but some days are harder than others. I understand, taking care of a loved one is tough. But you have to take care of the other things in your life too. You don't wanna be busing tables forever, do you? No. I know there are things I need to work on. I just don't know how or where to start. Have you ever thought about getting professional help? What do you mean? Well like a caregiver or a home health aid. I mean my daughter Kate, she's a CNA and she knows a lot of nurses that do that type of work. You think she would do it? Well she's six months pregnant and she's studying hard to finish her degree. Right. I don't think we could afford it anyway. After my dad lost his job, the insurance went with and we haven't had much luck with other options. Look, I'll talk to her. CNAs are a bit more affordable. Really, you would do that? My pleasure. Allen. I'm getting that timeclock fixed and if you're late again, that's the last time. It won't happen again. Asshole. Hi. Look who it is, how are you sweetheart? I'm good, how are you? - How do I look? - Handsome as always. I wish I felt as good. Well, I have something to lift your spirits. Jackie, you didn't have to do that. I just wanted to say thanks for helping me nail that interview, I couldn't have done it without you. You'd of done just fine. I still wanted to say thanks. You are too good to me. Why haven't you married this girl yet? Can't you at least eat the real food first? And did you take your meds? Look at this kid, like clockwork son. Like clockwork. Well I actually have to get going. I just wanted to see how you were doing. Thank you dear, it's nice to see you. Bye. See ya. She's a good one, reminds me of your mother. I, I need to ask you about something. Okay, shoot. I'm, I've just got a lot going on right now. Like what? You know, just stuff. Uh-huh. And I'm gone a lot. And? I was thinking maybe we could hire some extra help, just so you're not by yourself all the time. Kid, kid, I don't need a babysitter. It's not like that, my boss's daughter is a Home Nurse and I looked it up. They do cleaning, they cook so you don't have to eat fast food all the time. Allen no, I'm fine by myself when you're not around. Plus we don't have the D for that. D? D, dough. Dad, come on. Okay, I'm gonna go lie down. The toilet's clogged by the way. Glad she didn't go in there. Exactly. I don't know how these casinos expect us to make any money playing for so little. So you don't know anything going on? All right yeah, well just keep me updated okay? Later. Dad. Son of a bitch. What the hell happened? My damn leg went out trying to get to the kitchen. Where'd you get all the cards and chips? Never got rid of 'em, should've known better with you. Are you kidding me? - It's just one. - One? I find that hard to believe when I come home and you're on the floor. - I'm not drunk. - Even if it was just one, that's enough to screw up your recovery. This is your fault, stressing me out with all this nurse talk. How long were you on the floor? How long? A couple hours. I'm calling that nurse. Hi. - How are you, Allen? - Hey, good. Good to see you Kate, thanks for coming. It's no trouble. Not the paradise you hoped for? This must be Rich, hi I'm Kate. I heard you at the door. I'm sorry, he's a little cranky. Right. I heard you have alcohol hepatitis. Have you stopped drink... It's water. Not the most conventional way of stopping but it helps. Okay. I assume you're on medication? Yeah, he's on anti-inflammatories and painkillers. Great, have you experienced any symptoms of the disease? Are you eating regularly? Look lady, my liver's total shit. My leg's bad from working a job I hated. I made bad choices when I was younger and I'm paying for it now, there's no help for me. You play no limit? Excuse me? 50 chips, you and me. If I win, you let me do my job. If I lose, I'll leave. I don't play anymore. Come on, what kinda poker player turns down a good bet? Throw him in too, I'll beat you both. Fine but the kid sits out. I don't need him thinking that I'm okay with this. Okay. Let's do it. Six. Call. - I'm all in. - Call. Well I got the boat, fours over aces. So do I, aces over fours. What? My dad's been playing my whole life, I know a few things. Sorry about my dad. Ever since the disease came, he's kinda given up all hope on himself. It's all right, he's not even my worst. That was pretty impressive, what you did in there. I had no idea your dad played poker. I learned it's best to develop a relationship with the clients early on, do you play at all? I do. He doesn't know. He didn't seem too thrilled about you playing. So, where do we go from here? I'll make a plan, I usually recommend six hour visits three times a week. Sometimes more depending on what you need from me but I do housework and general nursing, hang out with him in layman's terms. Okay so, how much does that cost usually? It depends, he doesn't have insurance so the agency takes into account what patients need but I've seen people pay as much as $250 per visit. Oh. You know I have to admit, I've never seen anybody use a home health aid for somebody in your dad's condition. Yeah. I'm the only one here, I'm gone a lot. - I could really use the help. - Understood. I'll make this a priority, just know it's probably gonna be a couple days with other clients and school. Yeah that's fine, I appreciate it. You should talk to my dad about poker. He really likes to talk about it. - Thanks, I'll do that. - Have a good night. Hello? Yeah. Yeah no, I can do that. - Text me the address. - Sure. Hey, is Jackie around? Yeah, she's in the hallway. Thanks. Hey, is Jackie over there? Yeah but she's with someone right now. Who does this? You obviously don't give a shit... How would you like it if I interrupted you on the phone with your mother? - It's not right. - You know what, screw this. - Just go. - This is ridiculous. Hey. You okay? Can we go talk somewhere? Seriously. Three different people complained about them and then I go and I do something about it and then they make me feel like I'm the asshole. What makes people think they can do whatever they want and just get away with it? - They had that look. - What look? I'm better than everyone, so F you. Well they clearly never met me. I held back, that's for sure. I'm already so sick of this job. Well at least you get to boss people around. It's not as great as it sounds. I mean more money is nice but I don't know. Maybe it's not what I needed. Maybe you need to try something new, add some excitement. The only thing that excites me right now is when you're at a poker game. Well there's gotta be something else you want to try besides robbing poker players. Maybe. Speaking of, tell me what you got. Down south a couple hours. More guys but less money than last time. A little more expensive, so it needs to be get in, get out. - When? - A couple weeks. I work tomorrow but me and Robby are gonna try and scope it out Tuesday. Thank you. Allen, you got a minute? Close the door. Kate get you all set up? Yeah, yeah she's comin' by tomorrow for the first session. - What do you think? - She's nice. Definitely your daughter. She's as sweet and gentle as they come but she's still got some fire under her belt like her old man. I picked up on that and after what she did, I know my dad respects her. Really, what'd she do? He was being an ass about the whole thing. She saw him playing with a poker chip and challenged him to a heads-up game. - Really? - Yep, kicked his ass. How long has your dad been playing? He doesn't anymore, he gave it up a long time ago. Oh, I see. What about you, how'd you get into it? Well I was studying Business at Mississippi State and Tunica was just about three hours down the road. I used to go every chance I got. I couldn't afford to go to Vegas but that wasn't gonna let that stop me. My dad used to play blackjack in Tunica. He said it was the only place to get a decent single deck game. I've been caught at the tables a few times at Sam's Town. - How's the poker there? - The poker rooms are great. I mean they're really good to the players too. Vegas is great but Tunica, that's a hidden slice of heaven. Maybe one day I can check it out. You play? I want to play poker professionally. It's always been a dream of mine since I was a kid. An unrealistic dream but a dream nonetheless. Why don't you just do it? I don't, it's complicated. You doing anything tonight? Wow. Yes sir. I know you said you played but are you some sort of secret pro? No, the table's not that nice. I've always looked at poker as a hobby. Being a family man and a businessman, a steady income's always been more important to me. - It's still pretty cool. - Yeah. Course if it wasn't for poker, I'd a never met my wife. I suppose you heard what happened. When I first started, one of the cooks told me she passed. Yeah. Breast cancer. It happened when Kate was still pretty young. I used to travel this great country of ours playing in tournaments. One year they had a World Series event up here at one of the casinos. I checked into the hotel, she was working the front desk. She was a stubborn girl, I had to put all my country charm out there on her. Best decision I ever made, movin' up here. I tell ya I never thought in a million years I'd find a woman like her in a place like this. I miss her like hell every day. I'm sorry. Yeah, it was a long time ago. Look, I don't know much about your situation at home but I think it's kind of admirable that you're taking responsibility for your father at such a young age. He's always been a good father. I feel like I owe it to him. Yeah. Oh. This was my first trophy. Won it in a heads-up game with a few online pros from the area. Wow. You play any tournaments or professional events? I don't play as much as I'd like to. Well listen, I run a game every couple of weeks with some friends of mine. If you'd like, I can ask them if they'd mind if you joined us. - You would do that? - Of course I would. I think your heart's in the right place. - Just don't be late. - I won't. That'd be great. He needs each of these three times a day. He likes the vodka bottle at room temperature, - so don't put it in the fridge. - Allen. It's okay, I got this. I'm running out for a bit but call me if you need anything, okay? - Will do. - Hey, take this G with you. What's G? It's this thing. You'll figure it out. What? She kicked me in the damn eye. I told her ass to watch that heel but nah, trying to tell me it wasn't her first time on stage. Should've stuck with the lap dances from Raven. I know man, that girl was freaky as shit. Damn, Vegas clubs are crazy. What are you doing with that? I am making a few adjustments so this thing can have more range. We were a little close at that last game. Definitely. Hey, can I talk to you? You trying to go to the club right now? No dumb-ass, for real. Did you know Tony's into poker? Like Tony Tony, like our boss Tony? Yeah. I didn't think he had any other hobbies besides hunting our asses down at the timeclock. Well apparently he's been playing for a long time. I guess he has some friends that are pros. So what you saying? I thought maybe they would see something in me or could help me get better. I mean that's cool and all but what you gonna say to Jackie or your dad? Nothing probably, they don't need to know. - Yeah, good luck with that. - What's that supposed to mean? Jackie's kind of a bitch sometimes when you leave her out of things. Really dude? I'm just looking out for you. She sometimes leads you on to get you to do things that she wants, I don't like it. I'm sorry but I'm definitely down to stop doing these hits. I can't keep doing this shit. Why are you doing it then? You gonna build one of these? Hell no. Look, don't let nothin' get in your way bro. All right, let's go check this place out. - What the hell? - What? He called it off. Well go, don't wait. Son of a bitch. What the hell was that? Something wasn't right. We shouldn't have gone there so fast. Allen, you've had weeks to make sure this was okay. Jaqs, I don't know what you want me to say. I told you word spreads fast with those guys. They started talking about other games that got hit and I panicked. That's bullshit. That last hit was like another state away. I was doing fine just robbing houses by myself. This was your idea and now you're bitching out on me? Everyone has a part here. You do a great job playing but it doesn't matter how you play if we don't go in. Grow a pair and find me something worth getting into. Sorry man. Hey. Hey. Late night? Yeah. Is he sleeping? Yeah, the medication can make him a little drowsy. - How's he doing? - Stubborn mostly. Yeah, that's Rich. So I didn't get to tell you this on my first visit but I just wanted to let you know that I'm monitoring your dad's blood pressure, it's a little high. Should I be worried, or? Well I'm making him a follow-up appointment just to be sure but it's pretty typical for somebody in his condition and I just really want to make sure that the complications haven't caused more scarring or cirrhosis. So, my dad told me that he showed you the garage. Yeah, don't take this the wrong way but I find it odd that you were raised by this businessman and he plays poker and you became a nurse. Well, becoming, I'm not one yet. - Right, sorry. - No, it's fine. I just always knew that I wanted to help people ever since my mom got sick. I got to be there for her through everything and there's a lot of people who don't have that. So I just wanted other people to know that they don't have to be alone through a time like that. - I'm leaving. - You are making a spectacle of yourself. Who cares, there's nobody here to see it. Allen is upstairs. Yeah, I try to do the same for my dad. It's hard knowing if what I'm doing helps with how he treats the situation. I have to go see my other patients. But I got your mail for you. Thanks. Allen. Try not to beat yourself up over things you can't control. - Hello? - Allen, Tony. I got your number from the work schedule, - I hope you don't mind. - No no, that's fine. - Is everything okay? - Yeah. Look some buddies of mine decided to get together and do a poker game tonight. I thought I'd call and see if you wanted to join us. I know it's a last minute decision, so I understand if you can't make it. Oh no no, definitely, yeah I can make it. I just need to stop home and change. How much should I bring? Always bring only what you can afford to lose. Okay. All right, we're playing at my house. So I'll see you later. Did you rob a bank or something? Where did you get all that? I've been saving my tips. Going out? Did you take your pills? I'm gonna go meet up with Robby. Yeah? You owe him some money? Took my pills three times today just like I was supposed to. Good. Kate took me to the doctor. Says I got high blood pressure. Yeah, I know. I just wanted to tell you what's going on. I don't want to hide anything from you. What are you trying to do, are you trying to make me upset you? I know what you're about to go do, - so why don't you just say it? - All right, fine. I'm gonna go play cards with my boss, happy? He knows some pros and I'm gonna go meet them. Why would you want to go do that? I don't know, because I thought it'd be fun. What? I wanna be alone for a bit. There are clean clothes on your bed. Two. Call. Two pair. Three of a kind. Hey everyone, this is Allen, the kid I've been telling you about. This is Phil, Danielle and Maria. Hey. It's a $200 buy-in to start. Nice to meet you all. Tony said some of you guys play online poker. Those two do, I'm too old for that nonsense. I spend my time back and forth between here and Vegas. You can tell she's a bit old-fashioned. What about you Allen, online or casino? Well I don't really play either. Online is a great place to play a lot of hands cheaply. It's also a good place to learn how to play tournaments. - Here we go. - What? Well Danielle here is not into tournaments. Cash games are just way more profitable for me. Just wait 'til the big game. Big game? I'll leave that one up to you, Tony. Every few months we try to get five or six people together and play what we call the Deep Stack. $15,000 buy-in, winner take all. Wow, how do you guys not kill each other after losing? Well poker is all about leaving emotions at the door. Plus it reminds us that even though we're all friends, we're still opponents. You have to be able to separate the two on and off the felt. When do you guys play? A few weeks from now, right Tony? Yeah, it'll probably be the last one for awhile though. When that baby gets here, I'll be involved in grandfather duties. Well I mean I'd definitely want to play. Well why don't we play for a bit and see what you bring to the game? Okay Allen, we're gonna play $1, $2 blinds. And you're the small blind, Allen. Dammit, just a second. - Hey Jackie. - Hey. - How you been doing, dear? - I'm good. I made some soup and had some leftovers. - Thought I'd bring you some. - Thank you. It's been awhile since I had a home cooked meal. Is Allen working tonight? Apparently he's playing cards with his boss. Wait, I thought he didn't play anymore? He's been doing it behind my back. Flush. Almost a flush. - See you guys next time. - Get safe going home. - It was nice meeting you. - Nice meeting you guys. I was really impressed by what I saw tonight. But I would recommend next time playing a bit tighter. Big pairs, suited connectors. Don't be afraid to be aggressive. There were a lot of times tonight where you could've had it if you just wouldn't have waited. That makes sense, I'll do that, thanks for the advice. Tony, as always it was great seeing you. Good seeing you Maria, be safe going home. All right, see you guys. - So how'd it feel? - What? - Playing with the big dogs. - It was awesome. - I'm really glad I came. - Good. So Maria mentioned how she goes back and forth to Vegas. Would that be a good idea for someone like me? I figure if I can get enough money to play the Deep Stack, that could give me a head start. I would suggest you continue to work on your game a bit before you do either one of those things. No you're right, I'm just excited. There's nothing wrong with that. You just keep playing, keep learning, learning from your mistakes. You know I see a lot of gamblers around here. You're different, I see you think about your decisions and what your moves are. Just keep at it. One of these days, I think you'll be a good player. I'll do that. Come in. Good morning. - No Allen? - Work. - How you feeling? - Peachy. - What's going on? - Nothing. So, we're still doing this, huh? He lied to me, he's been lying to me. He knows it upsets me when he plays cards but he does it anyway. Why are you so upset that he's playing cards? He's a smart guy, it's not like he's going to gamble away all of his money. I used to play. I taught him when he was really young and after my wife left, I went downhill pretty fast. I drank a lot, I gambled a lot. He watched me go through all that nonsense his entire life and I'm just afraid that it could've rubbed off on him. I know he can be the next big thing, I knew that since he was young. I just worry about him. Especially what would happen if... If what? If my days were numbered. Okay I know you're not very optimistic about your situation right now. But I know you can beat this. It's hard to think so. If you can't think that for yourself, at least do it for him. You're not so bad. Want some C? What's C? Coffee. Not bad, not bad at all. Yeah, I'll take some decaf. Good. Because that's all you're gonna get. Seriously I can't believe that happened. One of them goes back and forth to Vegas. My cousin lives in Vegas, what's the big deal? Yeah try again. You want me to come out there and look at it? No, I need to learn this. - I told my dad. - Yeah, and how'd he react? - Not good. - What about Jackie? Yeah, try again. You gotta come clean with her, man. I know she's scary but you just gotta do it. Go straight Shia on her. Right. You can't let her push you around. I don't want you to throw something away you love because you won't stand up to her. - It's not that easy. - But why? Because I'm terrified of her, man. I'm scared of doing anything that will make her stop talking to me. We started planning these heists and spending more time together and well, it was great. I liked that it gave us a reason to hang out. I like spending time with her. I don't like what we're doing but it makes her happy. I like seeing it. Bro, you'll literally do anything to get outta the friend zone. That's not funny. Yeah, it is. You just gotta do it, I mean if she cares about you, she'll understand. If not then you know, maybe it's just time to move on. I just don't know what to say. Just be honest, you know? I think she'll respect you more for it in the end. Try it now. Let's get the hell outta here. Yeah, I got work in the morning. It would be pretty easy. I've been playing poker most of my life and a lot of the players we would hit don't take the game seriously enough to be good. So as long as I don't do anything crazy, I can be in there long enough to not look suspicious. It's pretty impressive how much you've thought this through. - I think we make a good team. - Me too. It's nice, us hanging out like this. We're gonna have to do something else to divert their attention from you. What did you have in mind? What are you doing? I'm gonna hit you as hard as I can. What? No. Come on, it's gotta look real. Dad. Dad, what happened? - Are you drunk again? - No. My stomach. Okay, I'm calling an ambulance. Quick get the garbage, get that garbage. Here, here, here. Okay, okay, okay, okay. Get it all out, all right? Just get it all out. We really need to get you to a hospital. No, I just need a minute. I can't, I can't live like this. - Let's get you to the chair. - No. Don't touch me, don't touch me! - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I'm sorry. I can't handle this. Dammit. Come on, let's go. Allen. Come in here, close the door and sit down. Perhaps you don't recall but I remember in vivid detail the last time we had this conversation. We agreed to my simple request that you be here on time. Do you not have any respect for me whatsoever? After I have given you multiple opportunities and even invited you to my home, you missed the lunch rush on a Saturday. I know, I'm sorry. I don't want to hear "I'm sorry," Allen, I'm tired of it. Tony, it won't happen again. Oh I know it won't, I'm letting you go. What? I've made the decision Allen, you're done. This is bullshit, you know how hard I... Allen, it's done. Good morning. - How are things? - Not great. He had stomach pain the other night and vomited into the trash can. Yeah look, I don't think I can afford to keep you around anymore. Is everything okay? I'm guessing he didn't tell you but your asshole father fired me yesterday. - That's not nice. - Well he is. I had to stay up all night taking care of my dad and I overslept, he didn't even give me a chance to explain. Look, I'm sorry that happened to you but that gives you no right to insult my father. Forget it, all right? Maybe you should just leave now. - What? - Sit down. - I have things to do. - Sit down. I'm sorry you got fired because of me but that girl does not deserve to be talked to like that. Really, you're gonna defend her? Allen, you can't get angry at other people for your problems. Speak for yourself. I'm sorry. I'm just really pissed off right now. No, I deserved that. So how did poker go? - What? - With your boss, how'd it go? It went good, I played pretty good. That's good. Yeah, but it doesn't matter. I'm pretty sure I can't play with them anymore. Just give him some time, maybe he'll ask you to come back in. I was late a lot, dad. Maybe it was just not for me. My mind hasn't been right lately. I see a lot of me in you. Making small mistakes leading into big ones. You're a good kid Allen but sometimes I'm afraid you're gonna turn out just like me. I'm sorry for the way I've been acting. - Dad no, it's not a big deal. - No, it is. This disease has taken a bigger toll on me mentally than physically. I know it's affecting you too. I know I'm not the easiest person to deal with and I do appreciate you doing your best to try and handle it. - Thanks. - I'm proud of you, son. You're a much better man than I ever was. You've reached Jaqs, leave a message. The final score for Megan and James. We have 6.4, 6.5 and 6.2 giving them an average of 6.4. Now please welcome to the floor Jacqueline and Derrick. ♪ All I want ♪ ♪ Is to stay here ♪ ♪ With you, all I want ♪ ♪ Is to stay here ♪ ♪ With you ♪ I love you, Jackie. The final scores for Jacqueline and Derrick are 5.9, 6.0 and 5.8, giving them an average of 5.9. Now please welcome to the floor... Jackie. Hey. Why'd you leave so fast? I just wanted to watch a movie. - Is something wrong? - I'm fine. Look I mean I know you didn't win but I thought you were really incredible out there. Thanks, that means a lot. So, what are we watching? I think I just want to watch a movie by myself. Are you sure there's nothing wrong? Did you find another game for us? No. Not yet. Are you sure about that? What do you mean? I stopped by your house a few night ago and your dad said you were out playing poker with your boss. Were you gonna tell me about that? I don't know. What do you mean? I liked playing with those guys, they're really good players. That's exactly what we've been looking for. No no, that's what you've been looking for. I wanted to do this for myself. You need to stop being so selfish. Everything that we're doing isn't going to matter if we keep going at this rate. How am I being selfish? You're the one giving me a hard time about this. That's bullshit, you know I've wanted a better game. Even if I told you, we wouldn't be ready. This is a whole other kind of player we're dealing with. Apparently how good the players are doesn't matter, considering what happened last time. We can't just keep jumping into the deep end, Jackie. We need to keep hitting smaller games, building a flawless routine. We need to gain their trust, find their weaknesses. The only reason we got away with the one is because they were a bunch of jackasses who didn't know what they were doing. Our plan is flawless, I think we're ready. Why not just take a leap of faith? Because... - Because why? - Because I can't, Jackie. I already screwed it up. I got fired and my boss doesn't want anything to do with me. Why didn't you just tell me that? Because look what you're doing now. You're mad at me because I didn't tell you about a game. I'm mad because you lied to me. We're supposed to be honest with each other and you were hiding shit from me. You know what, I can't be honest with you sometimes. What, what do you mean? I'm honest with you, what do you mean? I don't feel like you care about what I want. It's always about what you want. Are you kidding me? - This was your idea. - I didn't do it for me. What does that even mean? - It doesn't matter. - Of course it matters. I care about what you want but apparently I don't know what that is anymore 'cause you won't tell me. I don't want to rob poker games anymore. If you want to potentially screw up the rest of your life, go right ahead okay? But I actually care about poker. I'm not just some criminal. So that's what you think of me? I'm just some petty criminal? That's not, I didn't, that's not what I meant. You're an asshole. Do whatever the fuck you want, I don't need you. What are you doing? - Hey. - What? What's wrong? Son, will you tell me what's wrong? You want to know what's wrong? Every time I want something I have to feel like the bad guy! - Come and sit... - No! I am tired of trying to make everyone else happy. When am I gonna get anything out of this life? I am 25 years old and I can't hold a shitty job or tell a girl how I really feel because I'm too much of a loser. Please come and sit down. Allen, Allen, where are you going? Come on, time to wake up. Take your pills, okay? Dad, come on. Dad, wake up. Dad? Dad? Come on dad wake up, dad? Yeah I need an ambulance, 606 Fourth Street. No no, it's my dad, he's not breathing. No dad, dad come on, dad. Dad. Dad. My dad used to work right over there. He would come here on his breaks just to get away from everything. He brought me here a lot when I was younger. We would get ice cream and watch the boats and jet skis on the lake. It's been a long time since we came here. But this was my favorite place to be with him and I know it was one of the few places that made him happy. Thank you, dad. You were the best father anyone could ask for. ♪ How ♪ ♪ How can I face you now ♪ ♪ After I faced ♪ ♪ What I believe ♪ ♪ Love ♪ ♪ I love you close and far ♪ ♪ I love you close and far ♪ ♪ I love you, love ♪ So... Hi. Hey. Come in. I didn't think I'd see you again. I wanted to offer my condolences. Thanks. How are you holding up? About as good as I can be. I see you're moving. Yeah. I can't really afford to live here without a job, so I'm staying with a friend until I figure something out. - I should go. - Wait. I was a total ass last time you were here. - That's okay, you were angry. - No. No, it's not okay. You didn't deserve that. You did an amazing job helping us out and I don't want you to think I don't appreciate everything you did. I shouldn't have fired you. - Sorry. - It's okay, it's okay. No. No, it's not. I fought with him and I fired you and... If I hadn't, he'd still be here. No no no, it's not your fault. I just wish I did more. - I could have done more. - You did everything - you could. - It doesn't feel like it. When my mom died, I was angry at the world too. Maybe if I'd done more or the doctors had done this, she'd still be here. But you can't be angry at things you can't control. Death is just one of those parts of life where you can't predict how and when it's gonna come. I just don't know what to do now. He was always, he was always there to help me out. When your dad and I would talk, he would always talk about you. He always knew that you were going to be the next big thing. I know he gave you a hard time about playing cards but if he were here right now, I know he would tell you to not give up on your passions. Thank you. You should go see my dad. I know he'll want to see you. Robby said living in Vegas didn't seem so glamorous. He did get kicked in the eye with a stripper heel, so. True. But man, Vegas is just like being anywhere else man, you gotta hustle to survive but once you make it down there, it's smooth sailing. I'm definitely think about it. Yeah man if you need a place to stay, you can crash at my crib, it'd be tight. Thanks man, I'll be in touch. All right, peace. You want any tea? No, I'm fine. Look, I know you said you forgive me but I still feel bad about what I said to you. I'm sorry too. You were right, though. I feel like the only thing that I've ever been good at is taking shit from people and I was just more concerned about me than how it made you and Robby feel. I know you love poker and so if you're out, then I'm fine with it. Thanks. And you know, I think you're good at a lot of things. You're smart, you're ambitious as hell. I mean look at the dance, you didn't win but it shows that if you want something, you give it everything. We wouldn't have gotten away with that first heist if it wasn't for you. Heist? You make it sound like we're robbing banks. You know what I mean. How are you feeling? It's still hard not to blame myself but better. I did the same thing when my parents died. But it fades over time, you just gotta do something to keep your mind off of it. That reminds me. I need to tell you something. Okay. I'm thinking about moving to Vegas. Oh. When my dad died, I didn't want to play poker anymore. It just reminded me of him. But I know that's not what he would want. If I stay here, I'm just gonna get another shitty job, then give up. I don't want that. I think this may be the best thing for me. I guess you should do it then. I think I can do it. But I need money to get there. I've spent most of the money from the first hit on the nurse for my dad. Don't tell me you wanna do another hit? There's a game coming up. I still need to convince my old boss to let me play but I need your help. So what are you asking? It's a 15 grand buy-in. - That's a lot of money. - Yeah, it is. But if you do, then we can split the profits which... I'll do it. - I didn't say how much. - It doesn't matter. Are you sure? I believe in you. I don't have all of it but the little bit I do have came from the hits anyway. - Thanks. - Of course. So how are you gonna get the rest? Hell no, why the hell y'all comin' to me with such a crazy ass idea? It's not the entire thing, only part of it. Why the hell you think I got enough money to cover it? The payout is 20 grand each, plus what you put in. So, are you in? Yeah, I'm in. Be nice. - Hey Allen. - Hey. Can I talk to you? I'll see you inside, sweetheart. Kind of odd you sitting on my front steps. Yeah, I've been here awhile. I'm sorry to hear about your father. I know how much he meant to you. But if you're here to ask for your job back, I've already filled that position. - I'm not interested in that. - Then what do you want? I want to play the Deep Stack. We've already got five players, one of the others called a friend from out of town. I know I kept using my home situation as an excuse to be a shitty worker. Some days it was true, some days it wasn't. I'm sorry I took advantage of you. But that's not who I am and I want to show you that. Well like I said, we're full up. The day I met your daughter, she told me that a real poker player never turns down a good bet. That's an extra 15 grand on the table. We're playing here Saturday night. I'm waiting for Maria to give me a start time. I'll pass that along when I get it and don't be late. I won't. - Hey guys. - Hey there. Glad you could make it, Allen. Me too. We're just waiting for one other person. Speaking of, he should be here any moment. I'll be right back. He says he's feeling good. - I don't know about this. - Calm your ass. I got a lot of money riding on this. So do I. Allen says to stop being a little B. Okay, Rich. Allen, would you join me over here for a second? I feel really bad about how our conversation went the other night. I was a little insensitive about the passing of your father. So I wanted to offer a sincere apology and my condolences on your loss. I appreciate that, Tony. But I'm not gonna feel bad about taking your money. Yeah, we'll see about that. - Hey everyone, this is Chris. - Hey, how's a going? - I need to use the bathroom. - It's down the hallway. Hey, something's wrong. Take a seat. Chris this is Tony, Phil, Danielle, Allen. Let's get started, show me the money people. Okay, first ace will be the dealer. What did he say? He says there's a guy there from our first hit. - He keeps looking at him. - So what now? - We should go over there. - What? We don't know if he's dangerous or not. Well we can't just go over there and expose him. Well we can't just sit here. Let's go. I will deal the cards as usual. Don't mind him, he does this with anybody he hasn't played with before. All right everyone, here's the rules. Everybody gets $15,000 in chips. White chips are 100, black 500, green 1,000. We're playing $100, $200 blinds, each blind level is one hour. This is No Limit Texas Hold 'Em, so you can go all-in at any moment. We play until the last player remains, $90,000. Winner takes all. Final call. That's round one. All right guys, let's finish this hand and then break for a few. I'm all in. I call. - That turn really screwed me. - You've still got four outs. The nine or the King could come up. Sure. - It was a nice hand. - Thank you. I thought that straight flush would scare you off. It was a tough decision but I didn't think you had it. Thank you, Tony. It was nice playing with you guys. - Tony, next time. - Be careful going home. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Let's take 10. I'm going for a smoke. What's happening? He says he's getting low, so he might have to make a move real soon. - Shit, put your phone away. - What? Hey man, good playing. You had me on a few of those hands back there. Thanks. You remember me, right? I don't think so. Allen? A couple months ago we were both at a high stakes game. There was probably around 10 grand on the table. The next thing you know a couple of assholes in ski masks bursts in and takes everybody's cash. I thought you had something to do with it. But then you pulled out those Jacks. Smart move. $90,000. That's a good haul. What are you saying, Chris? I had nothing to do with that. Maybe you did and maybe you didn't. But I'm curious to know what's gonna happen when you push the rest of those chips. Hey that's not necessary, put that gun away. I don't like making the same mistakes twice. What are we gonna do? We gotta go in there. - We can't go in there now. - What, why not? Did you not just hear what he said? If we go in there, he's gonna kill Allen. Allen, please tell me you had nothing to do with that. I didn't and I came here to win just like all of you. I find that hard to believe. The night we got robbed, I had seen something strange in one of the cars outside and that same car is out there now. Jackie, we have to get outta here now. I don't know anything about a car and I have nothing to hide. I came here to prove that I'm a good player, win or lose. So prove it. If you lose, you lose. Let's get this going, start the clock Maria. Raise to eight. I raise 16. Call. 2,000. I'm all in. Call. Well I guess you guys better flip over your cards. You got a two-outer Chris, you need a nine. Good hand. Thanks for inviting me, Tony. That's a bad beat. Allen. I'm sorry about what happened in there, - what Chris said to you. - That's poker. It could be over in an instant. No, I mean what he accused you of and all. He's right, I was there. You were? Yeah. I did rob that game. I didn't have enough faith in my skills, so I thought it'd be easy to take it instead of earn it. Were you going to rob us tonight? No, it was a stupid thing I got away with once. I really wanted to show you what kinda player I am tonight. I'm a huge idiot for even trying it the one time but after what I've done and what happened in there, I don't feel like I even deserve to play anymore. This is a lot to take in, son. I know. I just don't want you to think less of me. You've been a great friend, I'd hate for you to think that. Well you're young, young people make mistakes. But I hope you know this mistake almost got you killed. I know. I really wish I could take it back. But I can't change what I did. Allen, you've got talent and you've got the passion to use it and that's what makes the difference between those who do and those who don't. I know that now. Are you gonna tell him what I did? You know I should. But I'd rather never hear of this again. Thank you, Tony. And now that you're out, I've got some money to win. I'm sorry, guys. I need to tell you something. I know what you're gonna say. - Jackie, I just need to... - Allen, I know you love me. I love you too. I'm sorry I didn't say anything sooner. I guess I just didn't want to believe it and I thought that I would screw it up and lose you. It's my fault that I dragged you into this and made you feel like you didn't have a choice but you could have died in there and the thought that I would never see you again frightened me and I don't want to feel like that again. So I don't need those robberies or all that money, I need you and I'm sorry it took me so long to figure that out. So, do I get a kiss too? I'm glad you're okay, man. So, you lost all of our money. That we stole. Right, that we stole and we ain't gonna be stealing again. So, now what are we gonna do? - You get everything out? - Yeah. Most of it's in a storage unit. I'll be back to get that soon. You good? Yeah, I just wanted to see it one last time. Thanks for always having my back. I don't know what I would do without you. Man, you know we boys for life. You know, besties besties, better than all the resties. - You're ridiculous. - Ah, you love it. You gotta come see me though. Of course I'm going to Vegas. Not just for the strippers. Well damn, I might have to change my mind now. But seriously, you know I gave you a hard time about Jackie but I think you two have something special. Y'all got one of the most F'ed up relationships I've ever seen but I hope I can have that one day with someone. Thanks man. You sure about this? Yeah I mean you know, it's the least I can do after losing all your money. Yes! Are you ready? Yeah I mean, just thinking about how this is possibly the worst idea ever. Oh it definitely is, I mean who in their right mind would move across the country with no money? Especially somewhere like Vegas, are we insane? Yeah we're pretty dumb, not gonna lie. There are a million other ideas better than this. Suitcases already in the trunk? - Yep. - Yeah, I don't wanna unpack. We're too far now to go back, so. Way too far.
