A whole nation, a whole fucking world of plastic houses. It's like a rash. It's eating up this island like a case of bad acne. Thirty years, there won't be anything left that isn't suburbia... or the ghettos. Because they all want to live in places... with people exactly like themselves. They have their own police forces, some of them... to keep their greedy little children safe. And they have the vanity to call this place a community. Look at this crap. That's not a house, it's a thing to keep the TV dry. I wish we had a TV. No, you don't. I swear, I solemnly believe... that humanity is now officially descending the ladder of evolution. In 1,000 years human beings will be the size of gerbils. And they'll have one thought a year, in December... and think about what they want for Christmas. Decline and rot, my angel, that's the way of the world. Except for you. You are exempt. Remember that. Jack Slavin for Marty Rance. (water running) Hi, Marty. Me again. That's government land that you're eating into. Fifty yards of nature preserve that is a wetland, as I'm sure you know. You can call the cops if you want to. I'll call them back myself. I'll look forward to seeing the outcome. We needed a doorstop. What are you thinking about? I think I want to plant the bellflowers in front of the house today. At least leave me a place to walk.

That's a sweet little bridge, but I wouldn't want to drive across it. Well, seeing as we never go anywhere... You still don't understand weight-stress ratios. I understand them enough. - Enough for what? - For everyday needs. The Latin name for buttercup will only get you so far. Let me write that again. One more time... (laughing) with f-feeling. What is the Latin name for buttercup? Ranunculus bulbosus. What? I'm glad I got to know you for such a long time. Don't say stuff like that. - You have to face up to it. - Shut up. Okay? Do you know, I think we should get somebody in to help. Who? A maid? - Don't go off, Rosie. - (footsteps) (insects chirping) (crickets chirping) (sobbing) Go away. (Rosie continues crying) What is it? You're going to leave me soon. You're the one that's going to leave soon. You're getting too big for me. Look at the size of that hand. No. You're going to die. That's just the way it is. I mean, this thing may be pumping away for some while to come. When you die, I'm gonna die. - What on earth are you talking about? - I am. What are you going to die of? When you go, I'm going. If you die, there's no point to my life. Tough luck. Don't you ever say that again. Do you hear me? You'll never say that again. (sniffling) Tell me a story. Come on. (crickets chirping) Jack: Once... there was a girl. She lived in a little, tiny house. And one day... an ox came by. And the girl was so polite, she said: "Ox, would you care to join me for tea?" The ox, he wasn't used to being spoken to very much. He was flattered and said, "Thank you, yes." And he proceeded to put his nose through the door. His nose had a big ring in it. And the girl pulled as hard as she could on the ring... to try to get the ox through the door. And the ox pushed and pushed, and the girl pulled and pulled. Cracks started to appear around the walls. And the ox gave one great, almighty push... and the whole house collapsed around them. So she climbed up on the ox's back and they rode away together. In the course of time they were married. Let me look at you. I'm never gonna leave you, you know. (sniffs) I have to go to town tonight, Rosie. I have some stuff I've got to do there. I might not be back until the morning. - You'll be all right? - Yeah. - I'll see you later, Rosie. - Okay. ♪♪(Shooting Star playing) ♪ Seen a shooting star Tonight ♪ ♪ And I thought of you ♪ You were trying To break into another world ♪ ♪ The world I never knew ♪ I always kind of wondered ♪ If you ever Made it through ♪ ♪ Seen a shooting star Tonight ♪ ♪ And I thought of you ♪ Seen a shooting star Tonight ♪ ♪ And I thought of me ♪ If I was still the same ♪ If I ever became What you wanted me to be ♪ ♪ Did I miss the mark Or overstep the line ♪ ♪ That only you could see ♪ Seen a shooting star Tonight ♪ ♪ And I thought of me ♪ - Is she here? - She's downstairs.

(Kathleen laughing) - You like me that much, huh? - Yup. What about my kids? Well, that goes without saying. What about Rose? - Have you thought this through? - Through? I've thought about it, but I'm not clairvoyant. You know what I mean, Jack. Come live with me. Quit your job. Quit your jobs. I can make life easier for you. A chance to prove that I'm in earnest. (paper ripping) Call that an early retirement package. (Jack grunts) It's not coming out right, is it? I'm sorry. Look, come live with me. Give it a try. I'll take care of you, or you take care of me. Whatever. My kid needs a woman around the place and so do I. I need you. How's that? What are you thinking? I'm wondering if you're crazy or not. That's a waste of time, honey. (wind howling) (thunder rumbling) (gate creaking) My poor tree house. We can rebuild it. That's not a problem. Do you really use it anymore? It's my house. - Rose. - Yeah? There's some people coming that I invited. Guests. Guests? People, just come to stay for a while. It's an experiment. Okay? New chapter. Jack: Welcome, strangers. I see you... (chuckles) A couple of things. I'm so glad to finally meet you, Rose. - I'm Jack. - I'm Thaddius. Thaddius, great. You must be Rodney. - Rose, Jack, these are my boys. Thaddius... - Jack: Welcome. Yeah, we just... that's Rodney. This is Rose. Oh, I'm Kathleen. Wow. Does anybody else live out here? It used to be a commune. There was 60 people living here, give or take, at one time. Engineers, farmers, carpenters, a couple of scientists. We were trying to... It wasn't what you see in the movies. We weren't all painting ourselves orange and shaking tambourines, - or whatever else they got up to then. - (cock crowing) We were trying to rebuild society on a small scale. Trying to figure out a way people could live without destroying the planet. There's virtually no waste, no private property, and... I'll take that. It was an experiment. It looks like it didn't go too well. We learned some stuff. (whispers) Watch it. Jack: This is it. Just put all your stuff down there for the moment. We'll bring the rest in later on. - Where do you really live? - (Kathleen chattering) In my aunt's basement. How long are you gonna stay here? Not very long, personally. But I have a feeling that my mother will be embedded here for quite some time. Do you get a lot of postcards? My mother used to send them. She left when I was 5. She might be coming back. Oh, dear. Rose, would you like to help me set the table? I was going to make some cheese sandwiches. No. That's cooked food for the chickens... and that's raw food for the compost. In the big one: Metal and plastic, paper. You'll get the hang of it. Yeah, okay. Any questions about the house, ask Rose. One of you can sleep in here for the time being... and the other one is on the couch... until we get one of the outbuildings fixed up. It's fine. Is that all right with you? It's so quiet in here, it's like the inside of a can. Hey, where's the TV? No TV. Are you working at the moment, Rodney? I've been studying to be a women's hairdresser. What brought you to that? I always wanted to be a barber... but men don't get enough pleasure out of their hair. Did you do... - Kathleen. - Yeah, her hair. No, I didn't do Kathy's hair. My mother likes to think of herself as being 16 years old. Rodney. I'm sure if I cut her hair off, she would have a breakdown of some kind. How do you make your money? I inherited a family business when my father died, so I sold it. So you're loaded. I don't think you need to worry about that. Rodney: My mom said you were an engineer. That's what I studied, right. Alternative energy. - You got your degree in England? - Scotland. But I've been an American since 1972. Naturalized citizen, God help me. Why did you do it, then? Because I fell in love with this country... with what I thought it was going to become. You've got one more year of school left, is that right? Yeah, I guess so. I was expelled in the last year of high school. Why? For defecating in the 13th hole of the school golf course. Your school had a golf course? Kathleen: He's doing real well in school. Is that for me? Yeah, sweetie. It's a cheese sandwich. I haven't seen one like that since 1953. - I'll be right back. - Okay. Sorry. (birds chirping) Rosie, don't make me bloody well chase after you! They're not guests. They're moving in! They're guests until we see how it works out. - They brought everything. - Everything of what? They brought their lamps! I've got to admit those lamps were shocking. It's just an experiment, Rosie. Let's just try it for a while, see how it works out. God forbid, you might even end up wanting them to stay. You tricked me! It was a spur-of-the-moment decision. (sighing) She's so regular. Kathleen, her name is, by the way. That's the whole point. - She'll take care... - I took care of things! No, we took care of things. Now I'm sick. How long have you been lying to me? How could you not have told me? I didn't think you'd understand. I don't. Hey, little freak. You ever eaten a snake before? No. I know these kind of woods. You got copperheads in there, don't you? There's a few that live under a dead tree in the woods. Show me where the tree is. I used to trap snakes for this evangelist. What did he do with them? Put on a show. Said he had the power of God, 'cause he didn't get bitten. Did he have the power of God? He died of a snakebite. There. Does your dad know about this place? Maybe. Does he know everything about you? Wild thing. (thunder rumbling) (door opening) (Kathleen chattering) (Jack laughing) Jack: I'll give you a bedtime story you won't forget. (Kathleen laughing) Jack: Oh. What are you doing? I want you to do it to me. Oh, my God. I never did it before. Not even partly. And what made you select tonight for your initiation? Because I have to do it right away. My brother is out at the moment... probably doing something along these lines. If you maybe want to take a seat in his bedroom, he'll be happy to oblige. I don't like him. That's funny. I don't like him either. Look. It's not funny. Okay? This is tragic. It's not exactly tragic. It's ridiculous, okay? No. (stuttering) Okay, now look. Look. Wait. I... I wasn't aware that on top of being trapped in retro world... due to my mother's savior complex, I myself was to become a sort of... sex toy for my angelic... possibly disturbed... certainly odd new sister. Okay? Let's not forget that part. Who are you people? But I like you. Christ. I'm just... I'm not ready to unpeel my nylon... at this particular point in time. Not for anybody. It's nothing personal.

Look what he did to you. Do you love me? (knock on door) Is she all right? (door closing) Good night, my little dove. (door opening) (door closing) What was Rose's mother like? What was your wife like? Just about the opposite of you. What does that mean? You know you. Imagine the opposite of you. Thin hair, dark eyes, big tits? Go a little deeper. Rich. She was inscrutable... dreamy... capricious... deceitful and totally selfish. So it was a compliment. Everything from me to you is a compliment, no matter what it sounds like. That's a mean game. Come over here. I'll show you a mean game. Has Rose ever talked to a psychologist? Like your son, maybe? The psychology of hair? No, I'm just wondering. Is she still in school? I took her out when she was 11. How could you not have sent her to school? I don't believe in factory farming. I teach her here. Rose is the way you made her. What are you getting at, Kathleen? Well, you raised her so she couldn't love anybody else. She's not used to having anybody around. We come along, and she gets a little upset. What are you going to do when it's time for her to get a job? Listen, there are wonderful schools for children with problems. - You know, my cousin Vera has a... - Shut your bloody mouth! Did you hear that? (bed creaking) There's nothing wrong with Rose. If you don't think things are going to work out here, it's okay. I don't... Jack, I didn't mean it that way. I'm just... Look, it's not that easy for me. I mean... I'm sorry, okay? I'm not judging you. I mean, we see each other... I'm not! We see each other for four months and then you don't even tell her about me. And then I'm just supposed to move in here. I don't... What? I don't understand. Understanding, whatever the hell that means. It doesn't necessarily make a blind bit of difference. Believe me, Kathleen... I've made a mess of a lot of things in my life... and I don't have time to pay for them. So I'm just trying to live a different way now. - I'm sorry. - I'm sorry. And that's what I need you for. Are you able for it or not? - Yeah. - Good. I'm going to take really good care of you, okay? I believe that. Careful, I'm a sick man. (sizzling) Kathleen: Good morning, Rose. - How are you feeling today? - Fine. Breakfast in a minute, Rodney. Don't look so droopy. Thaddius! Jack: Good morning, Rodney. Interesting job on Rose last night. I think it looks great, honey. I didn't mean for it to be so explosive. Kathleen: You sure scared us last night, Rose. (Kathleen chuckles) You know, you shouldn't walk around with guns, even when you're kidding. I wasn't kidding. Excuse me? (blender whirring) What are you wearing? That's half the day's electricity gone. No food again. Thank God. Hey, you've already lost 16 pounds, honey. Let's just keep it up. Breakfast! Now. I love my life. Excuse me. What are you doing today? I don't know. Maybe I'll go find a job mowing some other rich people's lawns. Aren't there any other people on this island or what? Soon enough you won't be able to piss on this island without 15 people clapping. May I be excused? Well, turn the light on at least. You're going to ruin your eyes, always reading in the dark. You know, Thaddius used to work in a garage. (laughing) I was just... I was just thinking it's amazing his skin stayed so clear... after working in that grime for so long. - Kathleen: Pancake, Rose? - Rose: Sure. What are you on about? Mom, he's gorgeous. He probably already has a date lined up for tonight. Isn't that right, Thaddius? He has been known to date farm animals under extreme duress. Rodney, you ever going to take that jacket off so I can wash it? Yeah, Linus, maybe you'd get a date then, too. Can I come with you to look for your job? You're not going anywhere. You've got work to do. And you can start by putting some clothes on. ♪♪ (Rodney humming) I see that I'm on toilet duty again today. It's a rotating schedule. Another man, another program. Would you please shut your mouth? If this one ever gives you anything, I'd like a commission. (footsteps approaching) Well, what do you know, you're interested in makeup. Don't worry about it. Let me help you. Sit down. You know, you're such a pretty girl, you should learn how to use it. I was only a couple of years older than you... when I had Rodney. It's hard to believe, you seem like a little girl. Do you want to be my dad's wife? (chuckles) Uh, well, one step at a time. With your Dad's heart as weak as it is, I'm just trying to keep him alive. It would help if he ate a little meat occasionally. This you need to learn to do without a mirror. Do you ever want to have kids someday? Do you want to work, have a career? Do you ever want to leave the island? Why do you always wear that jacket? Just scrub your tub, Miss Muffet. You know what? It's too hot. You're all sweaty. And I'm going to get that off of you! No! This is not funny. You're a sadist! Stop it! Jessie. Gray: Jessie, come here, boy! - (Jessie barking) - Hey. What happened to you? Mom's got me cleaning the latrines. - Who's Mom? - Ask Jack. You brought everything. - Yup. - That's great. Thanks. Kathleen: Hi. - Gray: Hi. - I'm Kathleen. I deliver flowers for Rose every now and then. Well, you must have a name. - Gray. - Gray. That's a nice name. Rose certainly is a passionate gardener. Yeah, she's got the touch. Yeah. It's probably good for her, too. All right, well, go on with your day. It's nice to meet you. If you want any lemonade... - I've got some in the kitchen. - Thanks. Okay. (thunder rumbling) Hi. I didn't see you there. Could you do me a favor? Sure, what? Could you teach me how to kiss? - What? - Please. What happened to you? You used to be so shy. I just have to. You don't want to do that with me. Why? Because your first kiss is supposed to be romantic... and like an accident. It's not like learning to swim. Well, can't we be romantic? I just don't think of you that way. Gray: Jessie, come here, boy! I hope you don't think I'll be frying that up for supper. (giggles) We're not really in much of a rush! It's okay. Have you ever thought of suicide? Yeah, but I'd like to do it myself, if you don't mind. I'm going to, when my dad dies. - Is that a definite plan? - Yeah. Hey, Rodney. She's with child. Red Berry: What's up? Watch the baby. Rodney: This is, uh, my friend Rose. Rose, Red Berry. Hello. It's nice to meet you. - Shall we? - Shall we, indeed. So, I'm totally excited about seeing this commune. How's the baby? Heavy. He's gonna be a big boy, just like you. - Jack: Hey, Gray. - I picked up your mail on the way in. That old Ferenzie working you pretty hard. Not too bad. When is he going to make you manager? I don't know, maybe this summer. You must have been working there, what, five years? Seven. That's too long to work by the hour. That guy's exploiting you. You know more about his business than he does. Well, he owns the place. Thanks for the check. I could have used you around the place when it was up and running. You let me know when you're ready to build something of your own... and we'll talk about a loan. Thanks, Jack, but... (stammering) I wouldn't be able to do that. If you don't like your situation, then change it. If you can't change it, leave it. It's your fucking life, man. I appreciate it. So, I'll see you on Saturday. Saturday, wasn't it? - Yeah. - All right, thanks, Gray. (birds twittering) Red Berry: Is Thaddius around? Rodney: He's looking for a job. Ah. Rodney: Yeah. Oh, my God. This is awesome. What is this place? Rose: It used to be an acid pad. Wow. I bet you guys do a lot of drugs. Hey, Rose, I want to show you something. - Just stand back for a second. - All right. You ready? (whooping) (laughing) You had the baby. Fantastic. Hey, Rose, do you think I could see your palm? There's like hardly any lines in your hand. Oh, well. I guess some people just make themselves up as they go. I made up my name when I ran away. - You did? - It just came to me. I was standing outside of my mom's house and it was snowing. And I just saw this little bush with these hard, shiny red berries on it... just growing out of the snow. Next time someone asked me what my name was, I just sort of said... Red Berry, and it just kind of stuck. Why did you run away? The important thing is, you have to forgive everybody. I forgave everybody after I left, even my mom and my brother. Oh, my goodness. That's perfect. We have a genuine and authentic, I'm sure... wedding and engagement ring set. And I think you shall have them. Thank you. Red Berry, you don't seem like the marrying type. I'm sorry. I'm definitely going to get married... to a big fat man... with a tiny wiener I can barely find. (laughing) - Not you, Rodney. - Thank God. He has to be really old, though. You know? Do you think that Kathleen is gonna marry your dad? She wants to. Yeah. Mom is a sucker for a sick man. My father was a diabetic. What was Thaddius' father like? He was just an idiot. I got a bee sting. Jack: Hey, Rosie. I didn't squash him or anything. I was just out by the compost. Rodney, come here for a second. Let's have a look. Hold still. (Kathleen sighs) You know, the only person you're hurting with that is yourself. I'll be living off guilt-burgers for a couple of weeks now. They're quite thinning. All I want is to help you get down to a normal size. Shit! Easy! Bloody fuss. (sucking) Why am I always the monster? Will you please tell me that? It's a question only you can answer. Okay, I give up. Just eat, eat. Be disgusting. I'm signing off. (chuckling) What was that? (door closing) (crickets chirping) (knock on door) (door creaking) Which god are you praying to? - Where have you been? - Rose: Up in the dome. What were you hiding in there for? Nothing. Are you okay? I'm fine. (chuckles) That was quite a fit that Kathleen had today. Sort of a surprising aspect to her personality. Okay. Are you sure you're all right? 'Cause you're acting a wee bit strangely. Tired. Who's the lucky guy? All right, sleep well. (door creaking) If there's something bothering you, we can just talk about it. Okay. (door closing) I'll be back, okay? (exclaims) Go ahead. (exclaims) Shut up! (Rose moans) (Thaddius grunts) (sighs) (Thaddius moans) Thanks. (door closing) I'm just hoping that's your idea of a joke. New chapter. What's that? You've been ruined by that fucking scumbag! - Kathleen: (screaming) Jack! Jack, help! - What? Oh, my God! I'll deal with this later on. God! Jack! - What? - Oh, my God! I just saw a copperhead. It went behind that dresser, disappeared. It probably wasn't a copperhead. Don't get hysterical. I know a fucking copperhead when I see one! Shit. Oh, God. All right, everybody out of the room. (gun cocking) Did I invite you to stay? (screaming) Oh, God! Who were you planning on killing? I just wanted to scare her. What are you hanging around her door for, faggot? (sobbing) Kathleen: Hi. I'm Marty Rance. Hi. I'm Kathleen. I'm looking for Jack Slavin. He's in the house. There's a snake in there. Copperhead. That's why I'm... Thanks. Marty: Hello. I'm Marty Rance. I'm developing that land over on the other side of the field. I'm just making the rounds of the neighbors, trying to get acquainted. Looking for Jack Slavin. I'm Jack Slavin. Jack Slavin. Marty Rance. Great timing, Marty. How's your day so far? I'm just spending the afternoon kind of making the acquaintance... - Saying hi to... - I know that. You just said that. So I did. How are things going down at the site? You know how it is when you're trying to build something. You get setbacks. You get trespassers, vandalism. Makes it hard to keep things tidy. I'll agree with you on that one. It's trespassing and vandalism that I can't abide by. Never could. It's nice to hear you saying that. The reason you can't build on a wetland, see, Marty... is that all that shit... that goes into your sewer system over there... will end up running into the island's water supply. The ground's too soft, quite apart from the wildlife that you're poisoning. That may not be a wetland anymore. How did you work that out? I'm making an appeal. We have excellent sewers. - I'm sure you do. - Yeah. You're bribing someone on the corps of engineers, isn't it? I know you've got the housing board in your pocket already. I really came here to try and make peace... to forget about anything that either one of us might have done to upset the other. But by the same token, one of my men gave a pretty accurate description... of a person who shot up our work site a little while ago. Yeah, that was me. (chuckling) Mmm. You don't tell on me, I don't tell on you. Is that how it works? Here's the thing, you're slinging up houses on a wetland, right? I just want you to take down one of them. - Pick a house. I'll leave it up to you. - Of course, that's out of the question. See, Marty, if you don't destroy one of those houses... I'm going to have to kill you. (chuckles) I hope you're kidding. For your sake. (chuckles) I tell you, from top to toe, I couldn't make any improvements. You're perfect. You too, my friend. (engine starting) I stuffed up most of the holes in the house, so we should be all right. I'd prefer it if you didn't smoke near the house, please. Since when? Since I just fucking told you not to, you little rodent. You're the boss. That's right. I am the boss. And you're moving out. I don't want you sleeping in my house anymore. You've got one more night... for your mother's sake. If it weren't for her you'd be out on your ass tonight. (birds chirping) I got you back. Got me back for what? For Kathleen. Now we're even. That's insane. You think I'm crazy too now? ♪♪(music playing faintly) ♪♪(music playing) Red Berry: We're tripping. Who is? Thaddius and I are. Isn't that perfect? You all came. I was hoping. Rose: Okay, let's learn a little American history. This is a genuine imitation acid pad that was built in 1971. It's so cool. It was built as a meeting house. Right. Sorry. So there was an idea that all this stuff... all these images and sounds that you'll be hearing, with a little luck... would break down the psyche of the people that were tripping. A person could smash past themselves... and become part of the other people in the room. Am I getting this right, Jack? I'm just here as an observer. See, acid was just a tiny part of it. Jack wanted this commune to be a pure place... full of people who re-invented themselves... hard-working people who weren't greedy or petty or selfish... people who could actually share property... because they weren't enslaved by the patterns they inherited... from their moms and dads. It was going to be total freedom. Total freedom. See, Jack forgot how to believe in communal life a long time ago. How the hell would you know what I believed in, sweetheart? But anyway... seeing as we have guests, I thought we'd have a little... educational "l" nostalgic experience. (switch clicking) (projector whirring) ♪♪(rock music playing) Give up, boy!

I just can't leave him. I guess I'm not going to see you again. You might as well know that you're pretty spectacular. (bell ringing) (boat engine revving) Are you getting on or not? (man chattering) (crickets chirping) Was that you who put the snake in the house? I'm about that far away from my next heart attack. So what the hell's going on with you? Have you nothing to say about all of this? (crying) Your problem is you're scared. If you had any courage, we wouldn't be in this mess. Who gives a shit what other people think? What are you talking about? You know what I'm talking about. No. - (engine starting) - Don't go off like this.

I was the happiest man, Rosie. I was. I can't go back. I can't see her again. Where are you going? I'm going to go try and make a transaction. (door opening) Can you move out for that? What about $15,000? $20,000. Tomorrow night, okay? Thank you. (door closes) (sobbing) She's leaving by tomorrow night. Really? I guess we'll have to stay in this godforsaken place for tonight. Take off your shoes. You've got to be kidding me. Off. (exhaling) Lie down. I don't want to lie down in here. This place gives me the creeps. I like it. It's going to be fun. Remember how we used to camp out? Yeah, but... - not in housing developments. - (cutlery clinking) Jack: What--What are you feeding me here? Beans. I want you to promise me something. That thing that you said a while back. When I die, you're going to die. I want you to take that back. Take it back. I promise I'll try. Little flower. I'm so happy. Oh, God. God forgive me. No. (mumbling) Jack: Oh, God. (birds chirping) (gasping) (engine starting) (crashing) Jack: We've got a whole day to kill. We may as well go to the mainland. Why do people want everything to be so ugly? (chuckling) I was thinking of paying Marty Rance a visit. You can ask him yourself. Got it. That's it. (doorbell ringing) (knock on door) Hello. Where did you say that you lived? Over on the south side of Marsh Island, by the tip. I didn't think that was developed yet. There's an old commune out there. We live on that. Oh, yes. Jack Slavin. Of course. Marty: Jack Slavin. - Jack: Oh, Marty, man. - This is a surprise. Just making the rounds. Getting acquainted with my neighbors. I'm glad you came by. - This is Rose. - Marty: Rose. Would you like some coffee? Jack: I'll take some coffee, sure. - Rose? - No, thanks. - Nice. - (Marty chuckles) How's that appeal coming? As a matter of fact, I was going to give you a call. That isn't a wetland anymore. As a matter of fact, that isn't a house anymore. Mind if I... What do you mean? Go see for yourself. Marty: I'm just going to build it again, you know. If you build it again, I'll have to knock it down again. I don't want to have to call the police. Call them. I don't mind. Listen, Jack. (chuckles) I realize you and I have had our differences, but by the same token... you can't stop progress. You can't stop the future from happening. People have a right to build. Laws change all the time pertaining to the environment... as the community's needs change. I believe in putting people first. That's just my personal belief. But I want you to feel comfortable with the situation. So you need to tell me how that can happen. What the hell do you mean, "comfortable"? It occurs to me that I haven't ever expressed... my interest in your land to you. There. You didn't have to. I want you to know that if the day comes where you want to move on... to, say, a less... developed part of the world... (laughing) We all-- We all have our dreams of... of how we want to retire. Anyhow, if that day ever comes, call me. I think you'd be surprised at how much your place is worth now. When did you purchase the property? 1967. - (Miriam chuckling) - (laughing) You're looking... I'd guesstimate you're looking at... a 200% profit on your investment. And that's conservative. Is that so? Yeah. Think about it. I have to say... with our history, Jack, I would never have dreamed... that you'd end up at my breakfast table. Why? We're not so very different from each other, you and me. (chuckling) Well, I gotta hear this. We both do whatever the fuck we want, right? We both turn a blind eye to the consequences, us. That's the way of the future, right? - I'm a businessman. I'm not... - (exclaiming) I know what you are. (mumbling) I'm just seeing it now for the first time, right now. This minute, I'm seeing it. You have a vision, too, right? My land is like a blot on your perfect universe. When you see all these box houses... these imitation colonial homes... you get a feeling of what? Of everything being in its place. Of accomplishment. Right. When I see them... I want to punch a hole through the walls, set fire to them. The main difference between you and me, really is that... (chuckling) you love those little houses and I hate those little houses. It all boils down to taste. (sobbing) I've ruined her, out of-- out of some kind of snobbery. Ruined whom? Dad, let's go home. It was about something different. (mumbling incoherently) I know it was, but I can't remember, God forgive me. - I can't remember what it was. - I remember. Do you need a doctor? Does he need a doctor? Oh, God. All right, Marty, you win. I'll sell. It's my land still. I want to sell it. That's great, but just think about it. - I'll come by tomorrow. - I don't need to think about it. - I want to get rid of it. - No! We'll talk about it in the morning. I'll come by... No! Write me a fucking check, you imbecile. - Let me drive you. Let me help you. - Please don't. Turns out Marty is a decent guy. He didn't want to take advantage of me. What are you doing? You know what I'm doing. You'll be free of this whole thing. Get an education. Try and... - You've got to make a life for yourself. - I have a life. You can't just give up like this. Sweetheart, I gave up a long time ago. I just didn't realize it. How can he tell you, "You can't stop the future from happening"? Who made him the future? It's not his fault. It's just... That's the way things are. (sighs) Everything's for sale. Everything. Please don't sell it.
