THE TUNNEL The New South Wales government has unveiled a radical solution to the water crisis. It plans to tap into an abandoned reservoir under the city. 95 million dollars will be spent on a state of the art water recycling facility in the heart of Sydney. My name is Natasha Warner and I've worked in news and current affairs for well over 10 years. I knew that I wanted to tell stories. I knew I wanted to communicate to the public and, um, that looked like the perfect place for me. The New South Wales Minister for Water and the Environment has been under sustained fire for twelve months now. Sydney's water reserves are at an all-time low. We are a progressive government and in the face of climate change we need to look at all possibilities, and recycling water is definitely the way of the future. I first came across a story which was focusing on the government that had just announced some water recycling plans and they wanted to use abandoned underground tunnels in one of our biggest rail systems. Thousands of people pass through here each day not realising the State Government's solution to the water crisis is beneath their feet. The plan is to build recycling infrastructure to make use of millions of litres of water trapped in disused train tunnels. I didn't realise how vast they were. There's virtually a whole other city underneath us. But welfare groups say the tunnels are a refuge for Sydney's homeless building underground water recycling infrastructure would leave them with nowhere to go. The new homeless concerns are likely to cause another road block for the Government's water crisis solution. In a similar scenario in the U.S., hundreds of homeless were recently evicted from underground tunnels. It caused a public relations nightmare. You can quickly see why the government's having so much trouble evicting the homeless I mean, trying to navigate through this maze of dark tunnels is hard trying to find people hiding in here is virtually impossible. The water and enviroment minister says there is no evidence of anyone living in Sydney's tunnels. He says if Labour wins the election, the water solution will precede. After the initial fanfare the story dried up, it was like the whole thing never happened. That's when alarm bells went off in my head, things just don't disappear. Whenever something's not spoken about, I've got to ask why. It?s my job as a journalist. October 7th Cheers John, happy birthday. - My birthday... - What's your birthday message? - What do you have to say? - John- Actually I can tell you a story about John, you guys may not know this one, it was way back in 1991. My name's Steve Miller, I'm a TV camera man. I've been working in news and current affairs since the mid-eighties. He'd just started, and they sent us to the first Gulf War so we had to phone home to the office to John, who was the news director at the time and said send us more cash, we need to get some gas masks and chemical suits and stuff, so they sent us like $10,000. We thought we've got this cash in our hand, we thought fuck it, let's spend it on piss! Right, and the air raid sirens, everyone else is fucking pulling on their masks, and we're just going, ah fuck it. You kind of get married to the job, so the people you work with they end up becoming like family members. You've met Tangles, our our sound man, he's a handsome young man, but he's not very good at his job. - Come here Tangles. - What're you talking about? - I'm talking about the time in the States, when we went two weeks, and you went without headphones. Remember that? - And did anyone notice? - No one noticed. He's a genius. That's how good I am. I don't even need to hear it, just feel it on the knobs. When you get that gang on the road, when you get Steve and Tangles out on a shoot they're just... they're professional but they're also kids. At the end of the day they like to muck around and have a bit of a laugh. I remember Natasha, she was at another network and then a couple of years later they brought her across to us. First impression? Just another young person coming in getting paid too much money, hadn't really proved herself. But, you know, she was the next 'big thing'. Oi, hey Pete... Pete! ...Business meeting... ...Production meeting... production meeting... - Talking about producing... uh... some uh... - Well... - Just producing. - Sea-man. Well yeah... produ- How's that? You'd better turn that off soon. Hey! The one that got away. - I'm not away, I'm here. - Oh haven't we done that story before? Come in here mate. What's going on down there- He and I, we had an interesting working relationship. He was very determined, in the way he would do his job and I was very determined in the way I would do mine. Sometimes that would work well together, and sometimes it would sort of cause a bit of friction. Whenever her name came up, the subject was changed pretty quickly and when you think back on it now you sort of go, oh yeah, there was something going on there. October 10th I came across a YouTube video which showed some youths defacing and vandalising areas around the tunnels. - Did you do this? - You are fucking kidding me! Fucking teach them a lesson then eh? I fucking will This is what I think of your shit 'MK'. Within that clip itself there was something unknown, quite clearly though there was something there in the tunnel. What was that? - What the hell was that man? - Shh... Shh... - What was that? - Shut up... Oh fuck, what the fuck was that? They're still here. - C'mon show yourself you dickhead. - Shut up man. - Look just give me the torch... - Sef come on let get out of here - Just fucking give me the torch you bitch! - No don't... don't be hero, come on! It?s cool, it's fucking cool. Oi! - Don't... - Shut up. - Think you can tag... - Fuck Sef come on, we've go to fucking- - Don't go in there... - Fuck. - Just stay here! - Sef! Torch drops. - Sef? - Sef? What the hell Sef, come on! - Hold on... SEF ANSWER ME!... Sef! - Fuck this I'm out of here. - Jess c'mon I'm out of here. - Dez hold on don't go anywhere, wait. - J let's get the fuck out of here! - Def stop... Def fuck stop- C'mon! Sef?... Sef no fucking... Dez don't leave me down... Once I saw that clip I thought this is a story I can go to John with. You know, finally it's got some strength. Since when does a decent journalist use YouTube as reserch? It was a good clip, but at the time I thought 'she's crazy'. When I pitched the story to John, he put Pete on this. What that meant was, Pete had an upcoming job and story in China which he was very, very passionate about. And I had to give him the news that he was taken off the story. October 12th I first heard about the Tunnels being a potential story for us just as we were prepping up actually to go to China, with Pete. - Hey mate there's a focus chart there somewhere... - Oh yeah. - Can you just hold that up for us? - Yeah, yeah no worries. Beauty. He'd been working on this thing for a long time and he was pretty pumped to get over there and get stuck into it. I think he had some pretty good leads, which could have blown his career wide open, it was great. - How's look mate? - Mate it looks pretty good. It oughta the amount the repairs cost. - Thanks Tangles, nice one. - No more throwing cameras around stairwells. Yeah look I told you guys it's not my fault alright? Hey, um, you happy to go hand held? The lighter we go the quicker we move. Absolutely mate, we're going to China after all, more room for cheap DVD's, pirate software... You're all class mate. It was purely John's decision to put Pete on this story. While I was a little uncomfortable with having Pete there to start with, like I said before we weren't exactly always gelling. I was really nervous about talking to Pete, I didn't want to tell him. It?s not that exciting, when you're building your hopes up for this great big story and then you sort of get given a shit sandwich. I thought at that point I was doing the right thing. I thought that Pete having to postpone what he had planned was worth it in the end for the story. He did say he went in to see John. I don't know what happened in that room, and the contents of that conversation but, yeah, he had spoken to John about it, and I think it was from that point on it was clear he wasn't going to China and Nat had won the day. Why did John go the other way? C'mon. We all know why John was favouring Nat. October 14th Once Peter was on the story we started attending the daily presses to try and find out what happened to the water recycling plans. Pete was pissed off, but you know Pete's a pro. Took him a day or two, then he came round just like the guy he is. He started to do his own searching around, he had contacts in the council who he spoke to, and some rumours started to surface that not only were there homeless living in the tunnels, but there were homeless that were going missing. You know at that point we slowly started to think there may be something in this. So we just started by chasing the, then, water minister. The main thing that was apparent that he was staying quiet on the topic. He wouldn't talk to us, no one would talk to us so at that point we were just getting stonewalled. If it was true that homeless were going missing this was a big story. And it was a really important one. Where is he? Minister... Minister have you seen the report about the homeless people in the tunnels? Nothing to say at the moment. Have you scrapped your plans because people are going missing in the tunnels? No comment... no comment. Minister, should people be worried? Is there a threat in the underground tunnels? I have nothing to say. Well? - Alright... that was alright. - You reckon? I knew we wouldn't get anything. I think that definitely on quite a large scale there was a lot of people in the government that knew what was going on. They knew what was going on down there. You know, with everything thats happened subsequently, they were hiding stuff. October 18th I started getting in contact with a few of the shelters around the city, and eventually I came across one particular homeless man who I had believed had been living in the tunnels. So this was... I mean this was fantastic, we had finally someone to speak to. Right Trevor, just one second I've got to fix you mic, if that's okay. I'm not sure how she found Trevor, but Natasha found Trevor. We went down to this home, and we sat him down for the interview Alright mate, this will be fun, you'll be on telly. Alright guys, I'm sweet. Trevor if you don't feel comfortable with anything you let me know at any time. And, um, I'm going to be asking you the questions if you're not quite... if you're not quite sure of an answer that's okay we can fix that up later so don't worry about that. - Good. - Yeah? Thank you. Well the interview with Trevor was a tricky one but something that I am, I guess, always quite custom to dealing with. - Trevor I understand that you've been living it rough- - Call me Trev. Trev? Okay. Trev I understand you've been living it rough for quite some time now, what circumstances took you to living in the tunnels? Uh... Well it kept me and my mates warm in the winter... yeah. It all started out great, chatting away to him. He started to tell me a little bit about, you know, his circumstances, what led him to live in the tunnels. He started to really paint a picture of what it was like there. And amongst your friends, Alfie and Johnny and Harry and some of the others, do they still live down there... now? No. Trev? - Hm? - Are you okay? You comfortable? Hm. Yeah. At that point in the interview I asked Trevor what he perhaps had been through in the tunnels. I asked Trevor what he had seen. Clearly something had happened to him. Trevor did you know someone who went missing? Trevor did anything happen to you down there? Trevor... ...are you alright? NO! Shit - Did you get that before? - Yeah, Yeah I got it. Oh... my god - He is crazy. - I know. After Trevor's interview, it was clear we were on to something. All the pieces of the puzzle were symptoms of something deeper, I just didn't know what. I needed more. We needed to get down there. October 19th Your call may be recorded for training purposes. Please advise the operator if you do not wish for your call to be recorded. Hi, can I speak to Pam in the media department please? - Hello, this is Pam. - Oh hi Pam, it's Natasha Warner here. How are you? - I'm well Nat, and you? - Ah good, good, thanks. Look I'm just wondering if you can help me out, I'm working on a story and I need to get in the Tunnels under the CBD, who do I need to talk to to make that happen? Right... what's the story? Ah, look I just need half an hour. Um... just hang on a sec... Nat sorry I can't help you this time. - What? - Apparently no one's getting in there, and I don't think you'll be getting any special treatment. - C'mon Pam, it's me. - Exaclty. And people got burnt last time. I can't do it. I really need this. Look Pam, can you help me out? - I'm sorry Nat. Bye. - Look I just need half- I guess it's easier to look at it now and say that I was perhaps under a lot of pressure to get this story. At the time I just... I felt I was doing my job I was so focused on just doing my job. There was a lot of rumours kicking around she was in big trouble, and she kind of really needed to lift her game otherwise she was gone. Well I think that I'd put a lot of work into my career and I think it was all basically hanging on this one... one story. You know, I didn't really have a choice. Hey, Tangles, how's your head mate? Pete, I'm like a fucking shark, as long as I keep moving I'll be okay. Here we go this is what you looked like after Steve pulled you out of the loo last night. Oh Steve, new toy. - Mate, waterproof baby, ATG. - All the gear, yeah. Good at spending the network's money. - It?s not just water resistant, it's fully waterproof. - Yeah waterproof mate. Yeah can you roll up for me? I'll, uh, give them a bit of sound, uh, there it is. - Get that. - Sure mate. - Sweet - Rolling? - Uh, great. - One minute, Pete I'll just get you to say some shit. Get your shit together mate. - ...There. Hang on... - One, Two. - Y'right just say some shit to that. - Some shit to that. Um, yes very, uh, excited to be going in some smelly sewers... Yes hello, how did you go? Haven't got all the permits sorted but, um, John's got us covered, okay? When Natasha said that John was covering us and we didn't have permits. That's kind of a pretty loose arrangement, you know, you just sort of sit there and go ah well we must be fine. - You sure? - Yeah. - When? - We're on for tonight. - Tonight? Okay - Yeah. - So we are up? - Yeah mate. - We're good to go. - Yeah, you good? - You guys sweet? - Yeah, um, I'm good man - Alright. - The sooner we go the better hey. Yep. As a crew, it's... it's our job to film it and get coverage. It?s really not our job to question it. October 20st - 10:34pm Hey Pete just hang back, I'm just going to get a shot of Nat walking in. - Yeah? Okay. - Cool. Excuse me guys? Guys... Hold up, restricted area. Oh sorry mate, maybe no one told you, we're just going to be filming for about half an hour, we'll be out of your hair. - Just grabbing a few shots... - I'll need to see a permit. - Permit? - Yeah, uh... - You got a permit? - I've got a driver's license. ...Not restricted to her. Pete... how much have you got in your wallet? You're kidding me aren't you? - We're not third world here, it's not going to work. - Maybe it will- Guys? Everyone, time to leave please. - Told you. - Fucking hell. Let's go, come on. I was that far in to it, I couldn't go back, at that point. We decided to find another way in, with or without official... assistance. We found some access round the other side, um, and yeah it looked like a maintenance access. - You're sure John's got this sorted? - Grow some balls Pete. I, at that point, was starting to feel as though there was something not quite right. Um, so I thought to cover myself and to cover Tangles, and really to cover all of us I'd just film pretty much everything that was happening there. You know, I thought we had to have some sort of way of protecting ourselves, should something go wrong. You know, if we got busted and fined or whatever, arrested, um, you know, I had some evidence it wasn't me trying to push us down there, and it wasn't Tangles, but it was Natasha. Here take this. Here we go. Okay, let's go. - Take this? - Yep. We were just kind of covering our tracks as we went down, you know, we didn't want to get discovered. Looking back on that... ...that was probably a mistake. Eh? - We okay to be down here? - That's what she said, she said John's got it. When we start filming a story, when we actually start 'okay let's get it', 'lets roll' Pete and Natasha they look after the editorial content, and, you know, it's kind of my job to take over there and look after the pictures. Okay turn around and come back, I'll just get you walking past this grill. You guys just hang back there for a second. Tangles and I would go off and we'd just start getting stuck in to it, filming like we always would. You know, don't really need direction, we'd just get in to it. Once we got in sort of a little bit further, there were whole sections of tunnel that were absolutely, absolutely pitch black. It is completely black down there. You know you could go in there, turn the light off, spin around and you wouldn't know where you were. Cause there's just junctions, tunnels going off everywhere so I kind of thought, the first time I turned off the light and stood there, I just thought we're going to have to keep the light on and stay across where we are cause otherwise it's going to be pretty easy to get lost down there. - Hey Tanlges? - Er yeah? - Just come here mate, there's something wrong with the light, can you just check it out? Er yeah. What do you mean? Where's the connection? Yeah if can you look in real close is there something stuck on it? Ah shit! How did I not see that coming? Thanks for that Steve, my eyes are stuffed. - Great. - It's good let's go. Pete had sourced a map of the tunnels, but the further we got in, the more we realised it wasn't exactly accurate. There were whole sections of tunnels that weren't even on the map. Just give us the light here Steve. Okay. This is the entrance, thats where we came down before... There's that way, that's not here... I don't know why that is. Okay, through here. - Though there? - Yep. - That must be the way. - There's a lock up here. Once we got through, and past the maintenance areas and we'd got in to a little bit more of the guts of the tunnels, my impressions were that... that it was amazing, it was vast, this place was huge. - That's awesome. - Alright. Shit that sounds great. Pete? Uh, can I have ten minutes to get some overlay here? I'll give you five. - Five? - Yep. We were very close to the station there so, um, you know, Pete was trying to make us pretty low key. I was blown away by the size of it, it was massive, and just eerie. You know, I think we were all in awe of it. It wasn't really difficult to get great looking shots down there, you know, cause you're really just painting stuff with your light and whatever you saw was just... it looked really cool. Hey guys just hush for a sec. - Let's go? - That's good. Yeah sweet. The history to these tunnels, the ones in particular that we were looking at, was just incredible, and it dates back pre World War ll they... they were to be used as an underground rail system. Then in World War ll they were used as air raid shelters. Guys look at this. The current New South Wales government is not the first to use these tunnels for another purpose. I'm standing in a section of tunnel that was converted into an air raid shelter during World War ll. It?s complete with all the amenities that enabled soldiers to stay for extended periods. Various rooms were then, um, reused in fashion for training, for the SAS so time and time again they've, I guess, been reinvented for their use, and even to this day with the water recycling plans that were announced. I was fortunate enough to come across an area where it was evident there was definitely, you know, homeless or, you know, people living down there. - Am I good to go? - We, uh, hang on a sec. Go when you're ready We've been walking in the tunnel for less than an hour, and already we've come across somebody's home. Here you can see their makeshift bed, blanket, and empty tins of food. Coming across the belongings was very important, it was vital to the story, it was absolute proof that there was life down here. While there is no sign of an occupant at the moment, it is clear the minister's assertions of abandoned tunnels are incorrect. This was something that the government were denying, This is something that we could now prove. Hey Nat, I'll get a shot of you going down there actually. Yeah cool. Oh hang on, Pete, light. Cheers. Mate what's up? What? Nothing. It?s a bit tight down there tubby, you reckon you're going to make it? He mustn't like working on the show... Shit... - Nat are you all right? - Nat you all right? You okay? - Yeah I'm all right. - Do you need a hand? No I'm fine. Nat? Look we've already got the sleeping bags and stuff, we don't really need to get the lake. - We could probably do the rest up here. - Pete... Pete I'm alright. - I just feel it's a little- - I'm alright okay? I'm fine. Just let's keep going. - Alright, you take that. - Yeah. - What's up with Nat? - Oh she just really needs the story. After what happened last time, she's treading on thin ice. - Yeah I reckon. - That's why John put me on to this, make sure she doesn't fuck up again. If she's not up to it, why doesn't he give her the ass? Ah mate, I think John wanted to give her a little more than just that. Well he'd have to get in line behind you wouldn't he? Hey guys, you might want to know for future reference, that these tunnels carry sound pretty well. And as far as I can hear, you're all assholes. Fuck off... - Yeah give me the torch. - Right, yeah, hang on. There you go mate. - Get down there you asshole. - Pete can you just lift that headlight for me? Get a bit of sound. Where to? Just... - That's pretty cool. - Yeah, give it a kick. - Yeah, give it a kick. - Yeah? - Steve you jump in. - Let's send it on it's way. - What are we doing? - Just... just give it a kick. - You can... drag it for sound. - You call it. Uno, dos, tres, cuatro. Rattling of cart. That sound alright? Thanks guys. The lake was just... so... vast, I mean this thing runs a kilometre long. It?s bigger than I thought. Yeah, I get that a lot. Dickhead. Me and Tangles were mucking around a bit and we like to play jokes on each other, and you know, if I didn't do it he would have done it. So I just grabbed him and sort of went... you know, at the edge of the lake, went to push him in, and you know, how you go up, sort of hold on their shoulders and then pull them back again. Which I did, and then I let go of him, and went to walk back to the camera, In he went. - Shit - Tangles are you alright? - Yeah just... yeah. - There's your dip mate. Steve you... prick. Oi, this is not funny. Fucking hell. Are you going to give him a hand? You can stop laughing, okay? How long are we going to be down here, alright? Can I go home? Tangles, as much as we used to joke around, and muck around together, when it came time to work it was very you know, he was very serious, and it wasn't time for joking - Creative department's ready. - Yep alright. Okay Nat just come forward a fraction. So, you know, when he's sort of giving me the impression that there were problems, I was believing him. I'm standing directly below one of Sydney's busiest train stations. Behind me is the forgotten water resource that's causing all the controversy. Earlier this year the government- Nat sorry, Pete are you making noise? No. You weren't whispering? No. Alright, sorry Nat can we go from the top? Everyone just keep it quiet. - Okay let's go from the top again. Let's move. - When you're ready Nat. I'm standing directly below one of Sydney's busiest train stations. Behind me is the forgotten water resource- Nat, sorry, are you guys fucking with me? What's the noise? What are you hearing mate? It?s... hang on I'll just check my battery. Sweet, um, I don't know. Maybe it's your cables. Yeah cables don't fucking talk Steve, uh, alright sorry Nat... - I'll see what I can do. - Just go straight through, if you can if Tangles says he heard something, I do believe he felt he heard something. I can't describe how silent the place was so at the time I didn't feel that... he could have been hearing anything. It... it was strange. I was just thinking, you know, it could have been a technical problem, could have been anything, some RF interference, anything like that. But, you know, Tangles was adamant there was something going on, and uh, when he's serious about something, you know, you believe him. Earlier this year the government announced, then quietly abandoned plans to recycle water from this lake. The minister for water has yet to give a reason why. - Beautiful. Pete, happy? - I'm happy. How are you Tangles? - You good? - Oh. . Yeah, yeah sweet, yeah Alright, lets go. Let's move, grab your sticks. - Alright, let's go. - Let's get out of here. After we finished our piece at the lake, um, we decided to head for the bell room. Basically the bell room was built as like a air raid sort of alert back in the war. They would use it to warn people of danger. When we rang the bell, it... it was deafening, it rattled your ribs. This bell is a relic of World War ll, it remains here in the confines of an air raid shelter, as a reminder of what imminent danger sounds like. Shit, that blew my levels right off the meter, sorry, um... hang on, Nat can you just hit the bell once more? - Yep. Ready to go? - Yep. - How's that? - Nah, look if you want me to get that it's probably best I boom it from down the hall. - Yeah okay, well we need it. - Okay cool, two seconds. Tangles decided to, um, go in to the adjoining room off the bell room and boom it from there just to basically kill the sound of the level of the bell, um, which was just making his levels peak out. I don't really know much about recording sound, um, but I did at the time remember thinking 'ah that's a bit weird', you know, why would you do that? Just turn it down a little bit, surely it's that simple? Alright Steve can you do me a favour, can you just listen on the cans just a little for me? Why don't you get Pete to do it? He can do camera, he must be able to do sound. Nah mate, I've done enough hard work today. That's good Nat, yeah. Sorry guys, just wait till we're... He asked me to listen to the audio for him, which was fine, it's just put on the headphones and listen to it as it's being recorded. - Oh here, just hang on, take that. - Thanks very much. And then so Nat just went ahead and did it again, and, uh... thats... that's when uh... ...that's when I heard it. Bell atmos. Jesus. Yo Tangles! - Shit. Shit. - Tangles! Tangles! Pete we need some light down here mate. Tangles! - Quick, light. - Shit. Steve where are you? Down here. Straight, straight, straight. - What was that mate? - Just give me the camera mate, he's... he's gone. - Where'd he go? - I don't know. Tangles! - Tangles! Tangles! - What did you hear in the headphones? - What did you hear in your headphones? - Fuck. - Shit. - Tangles! - Tangles! - Tangles, come on mate! Steve through here. ' Tangles! ' Tangles! - Yo Tangles! - Here I'll do down here. Yeah I knew there was something was wrong. I knew he wasn't mucking around. My initial thought was just to get to him. It wasn't unlike them... so I guess my first instinct was that they were having a joke. What, Nat thought we were playing a prank, did she? You've spoken to her? She thought we were fucking around? Natsha is listening to the bell room audio recorded from Tangles' microphone for the first time. Okay Tangles, you good? Yep. Ready to go. Bell atmos. Tangles! - Maybe through here... no that's a dead end. - Tangles! - Fuck. - Tangles! - Ah shit. - What happened? - Battery. - You alright? It?s alright. - Need the light? You got a spare? - Yeah. - Yeah it's in here, hang on. - Okay. It became pretty evident, quite quickly that we weren't going to be able to find anyone, or anything without light. Got it. - Okay let's go. - We'll get him mate, we'll find him, we'll find him alright? Tangles! Now I had my camera light and I knew I had about two, maye three hours tops worth of light. - Steve, Steve- - Tangles! - Steve, Steve where's your key mate? - Yeah, what? - Where's your key? - It's back in the bell room. Okay well... all the torches are back there aren't they? This is the only light you've got and it's fucking around We need the torches mate, we've got to go back to the bell room. - But Tangles... - It's alright we'll get him, we'll find him. C'mon. - Fuck. - C'mon. Walked back in to the bell room and there was nothing. There was nothing there. All the stuff had disappeared. Now that was only in the matter of, I don't know, couldn't have been too long. Shit everything's gone. What! What the hell's going on? It certainly raised some concerns because I didn't feel it was something that Tangles couldn't do by himself. Fuck! Alright we're wasting time guys, let's go! - Just wait. - C'mon! - Pete... - Here take this, just give me some light Steve. Okay... Okay, Tangles went through here if we follow that all the way round, it brings us back to this room, we can scan the whole area. Okay. So we split up and meet back here yeah? No. We stick together, that's the only light we've got. How many batteries have we got left? - I've got two in my pouch mate. - Okay, let's go. - Steve... Steve! - Oh fuck. It won't do Tangles any good if we run round like headless chickens, we stick together, alright? You'd better keep up then. - Tangles! - Steve wait! - Tangles! - Shit! Yeah, I panicked. You know, it wasn't like I'm trying to be a hero or anything. You know, the smarter thing might have been to do something else but it was just instinct, just kicking in. - Tangles! - Shit. - So what do you think? - Think of what? You know, Tangles, is he dicking around? No, he wouldn't dick around for this long. What happened to all our stuff then? Who took it? I don't know. Could have been the homeless, junkies... - I heard it Pete. - You heard what? Whatever it was mate, I fucking heard it. Well what was it mate? - Steve? - Look lets just get going, okay? Steve? Steve? What was that? - Shit. - Watch your step. What's in here? - You alright? - Yeah. Nope, nothing. Pete, we've been here twice before mate. The only other place, it's got to be the lake. Maybe he went back from where we came. Maybe he's waiting for us. Oh yeah sure mate, he's fucking walked out in the pitch black, - He's at fucking Harry's scoffing a pie. - No I don't mean that, I mean he can't contact us, maybe he's waiting for us. No, come on Steve's right, Tangles is down here. He's got to be at the lake. Well how much light have you got? I've got enough. Alright then. - Do you hear that? - Shh. Let's go! Tangles! Tangles! This way! Tangles! I heard him through here, Tangles! Tangles! I'm coming mate! In here! Take that there quick... Get down and grab it at the bottom. Fucker Take it easy, take it easy. Oh shit, Steve, help. Jesus. - Steve, light. - Right. Oh Jesus Christ. - Steve... - Yeah? - His torch. - Ah fuck. It?s his torch, but it doesn't mean it's him mate. I can't really describe it, it was just... there was blood and... over in the corner was... Tangles torch. I... I sort of thought of myself as his older brother. You know, that was the kind of relationship we had. And, uh, he was sort of entrusted to me, that's the way I felt about it. Let's go. C'mon. We've got to move. She's right, he could be close mate. And whatever that fucking thing is, it could be nearby. Come on. - It?s Tangles. - Come on. Tash. Let's go. - Wait. - What? Wait, where's my camera? Just over there. It?s not where I left it. What? It?s not where I left it. What do you mean? Before we entered the room Nat put the camera, the night vision camera on the ground just outside the door. Um... and then we went in the room we wouldn't have been in there for more than two or three minutes, and then she came out, we all came out together, and she noticed that the camera had been moved. My instinct was to check and see if it had recorded something. Play it back. Tangles! Tangles! Get down and grab it at the bottom. Fucker Take it easy, take it easy. - Steve, light. - Right. Oh fuck. Oh Jesus Christ. We played back the footage and, uh, someone had picked up the camera, it had come off the ground, and there were shots of us in the room. It?s his torch but doesn't mean it's him mate. Let's go. C'mon. We've got to move. She's right. He could be close mate. And whatever that fucking this is, it could be nearby - it's Tangles. - Come on. Tash. And then we turn to come out and... the camera goes down and we just catch a glimpse, it was just like one frame. It happened in a split second I didn't know what it was mate, but it was quick and it was fucking frightening. Fuck. Oi! Oh my god... it's us. This isn't good. We've got to get out of here. We've got to get out of here. Mate I am not fucking leaving him down here with whatever the fuck that was right? - Steve listen, listen to me. - I'm not fucking leaving him. Look right now my priority is with you and Nat I'm not going to let what happened to Tangles, happen to both of you alright? We have to get out of here, we have to get to the top. Come on. No you go, go on your own, leave me here, I don't give a shit. Steve we need your light, come on. - You've got your own fucking light mate, take off! - Listen Steve, listen to me- - Listen to me! - Fuck off! - I'm not done, don't fucking touch me man! - Listen, Listen! Listen, listen, listen to me. Whatever that fucking thing is it's going to have a harder time taking us out if we stick together. That's bullshit. Listen. We need to get to the top. We need to get help. If we get more help down here, the better chance we're going to find Tangles. Fucking Tangles man. I know mate. Hey mate, I'm with you. I'm with you. Come on. Come on. Pete made sense, but I couldn't help but feel like I was leaving Tangles behind. It was the hardest thing I've ever had to do. - Is he okay? - Just give him a few minutes. So what's the plan? We get the fuck out of here, is the plan. Get back to the top. What? I think we should stay and look for Tangles. You're not here for Tangles. You're not here for Tangles. - Jesus Christ. - Fuck! Just through here. Get back, hit the light. Kill the light. - What is it mate? - I'm not sure, shh. Anyone down there? It?s the guard. Shit it's the guard. Who's there? Hey mate, it's us, it's the film crew. I told you guys not to come down here. Yeah look, I know, we're sorry. It?s just our friend, he's gone missing, someone... something's taken him. Right. I want all of you to come with me now. - Hey, come on! - Mate, what's happening in here? - Mate, mate tell us what's happening in here! - Nat, give it a break Nat. - We're leaving. LET'S GO! - Is he going to help us? Go! Go! Run! Keep moving! - Oh shit, oh shit... - Nat, Nat, Nat, here, through here. Through here. Your light. Oi Steve kill the light. - Where are we? - Shh. What was that? I don't know. Just keep it down, it could be close. Did you see it? No. Whatever it was, it was fucking huge. Nat... turn it off. Everybody alright? Mate, mate I'm alright. How about your arm? Give me the camera, let me see. I, uh, I hit something when we were running, it's fine. Shit Steve, it looks bad. - Nah. - Here Pete I need to see. - Here, show me. - It doesn't look good. I can't see. There it is. Just there yeah. Sorry, you alright? - I'll be fine, yeah. - Really? Thanks though. Thanks. We're going to make it mate... we're going to make it. Guys we've got to move soon, we can't stay. Alright, I just need a minute. Hang on. What... what if that thing comes back? I don't know. Could we take it? I doubt it. Only thing we've got to worry about now is getting out of here. Hey, guys, I think it's gone. Right, let's get moving. - Steve? - Yeah? - You alright? - Yeah mate, I'm good. Alright, let's go. Just keep it quiet. Hand me the cam. Just keep it quiet okay? Let's go. Stay close. Through here. Okay. Okay. Ah fuck... Pete... Pete what's wrong? Pete? What are you doing? It?s not on the map. What do you mean it's not on the map? It?s only got one way, this has got two. Pete you've got to figure it out okay? - Just chill the fuck out okay? - You've got to figure it out, you've got to. You've got to fix this. Just shut the fuck up and let me get through it. It?s through here, we came back through there, it's through here. Okay, what if it's not the right way mate? Well then... we find the safest room and we wait it out. Oh yeah, that's a good plan. John will figure out that we haven't called and he'll send someone down to find us. John knows we're here right? Nat... Fucking tell me John knows we're here. Oh you're fucking kidding me. I can't... are you fucking serious? Ah this is beautiful. - I needed you guys okay? - I knew it! I needed you guys in this. - You need us? - Yeah. We just lost a friend. You still need your fucking story? - No... - Huh? Fuck you. - Fuck you. - Keep you voice down. - You think you're a fucking journalist. - Shh! Well we came down here to get a story didn't we? And now we've got an important one, and you're fucking running scared! Shhh! Here's your fucking story. Here, you want your piece to camera? Come on. Let's go. What's your piece to camera for this one huh? Do you want to tell us how... how you lost a friend? Because of your fucking stupidity? Come on... waiting... - Fuck you. - Come on man. Come on. The best journalist can work under any pressure, and sort of circumstance, come on. Ah see, you can't say shit can you? You know why? Because you're not there Nat. You're just not there. You're fucking pathetic. - Go through here? - Yeah, yeah sure. Fuck, shit. Shit. What the fuck. - What? - Shh. What is it? Hear that? Through here. Kill the light. Guys, the lake's just here. - Fuck. - Shhhh. - Here, let me see. Show me. - Shh. - Is it Tangles mate? - Keep it down, shh. - What is it? - It's not Tangles. What's happened to his face? It?s his eyes. Oh Jesus. What's happening? We've got to help him. Let me see. Shh. It?s seen us. We got to go, come on, come on! Come on, let's go! Steve! Go, go, Go! Just move it! Jesus. Which way. . Which way? Shit. Go! Go now! - Where? Where? - Through here! - Steve? - Go! Come on! Keep moving! Is he still behind us? I think we lost it! I think we lost it! I don't... I don't think it's following us. There's a light in here. Here, here. - What's that? - I think it's the Cross City Tunnel. Oh... this is a bad place to stop No, no, no. Oi! - Hello! Hello! - Shh. - Hello! Hello! - Shh, shh Nat. Pete! Shut her up! You've got to keep it down. - There's no one there, there's no one there. - Please, someone... Help, hello... Shh, shh. Hello! Help! - Help! - Nat, be quiet, shh! Shh, shh. Please. Fuck. Shh. Shh. Can you see anything? Chuck the light, chuck the light. Nat... - it's alright. - I'm sorry. - Hey? - I'm sorry. It?s alright, don't be sorry. It?s not your fault, it's alright. I'm sorry, I'm sorry it's okay, shh. Everything was unravelling, it... it was because of me. I never meant for things to get so out of hand. I didn't mean to let Pete down, I mean I... I had thought I'd made the right choice at the time and I didn't mean to let him down. Steve, through here, quick, quick, come on move. Up here. Nat... Up. Come on. Here Nat, take this. Come on. You know, my natural instinct was to turn around with the light, to see what was going on, we'd just heard this sound, Pete yelling out, and, uh, as soon as it sort of fell in to the pool of light the thing just... disappeared. Upped and left. And that just sort of dawned on me then that the light... was our way of keeping it away from us. Pete you okay? You okay? Fuck did you see that? It fucking... it took off... let's get out of here. - Ah fuck. - Let's go. Did you see that? It didn't like the light. Well keep it on then. Hold on. What? Nat! Ah fuck. - No- - Come on, come on! - Come on you fucker! - Steve, no! Steve! - Come on! Come on! - Steve, come on! It was almost like it was trying to get us in a position where it could get to us as well. It reminded me of a lion trying to cut one animal out of a pack, a herd. You know, get the weak one out, easy to attack. - Ah fuck, fuck. - Shit. We're losing the light! Oh fuck! Steve! Oh shit! Back, back, back! Fuck! Go through. This way. No, it's a dead end. It?s a dead end. Oh Jesus. I thought that was it... it was over. There was nowhere left to run. Then I saw this tiny bit of wall that looked like it had broken away. Pete, take this, take this. Take it! Give her a hand Pete. Get the light Steve. Shh, keep it down. Keep it down. Here, come through Steve. - Huh? - Come through. - Go, go, go. - Come on. You go first. Here take this, quick. - Here Nat. - Okay. Shh, shh, keep it down. This isn't good. Steve is that... oh god... This isn't good. Steve... We've got to go. Fuck, fuck. - Light mate, light. - Sorry. - It?s gone. - Batteries right. Steve... Fuck I need some light over here. Quick, Nat, light. - Nat, fucking light Nat, fuck. - Nat... give me the torch. Fuck. Ah shit that one's dead. Oh Jesus. There's only one left. We need the fucking light... Steve, we need the fucking light! Come on! Okay... now RUN! Steve... Steve... Steve... it's going for her... it's going for her. We've got to go. Come on... come on. Nat! Nat! - Let her go! Let her go you fucker! Pete, come on! - Take her, just take her! - Pete! Just take her! All right. Nat come on! Come on! Come on, you fucker! Come on, Nat. Come on, let's move. - No. - Let's move. Come on. Come on. - Wait! - Come on. But... but Pete... - Come on! - No... - Steve we can't leave him. - Come on! We got... Nat... Keep moving. Keep moving! - No... - We've got to keep moving! - You can't leave Pete. - We can't, we've got to go! - Come on! - No... We've got to keep moving. I think that Pete was looking out for us and I didn't want to leave him there. Come on. Pete wanted us to be safe I understand that, but I didn't... I didn't want to leave Pete behind. Come on. Come on. Come on. Ah fuck it, it's Pete. Fuck. When I heard Pete's voice coming out of the tunnel, out of the darkness, uh, I mean, I wasn't expecting to hear his voice again. - Pete no... no... - I can't... Let's go. Come on, come on. Let's go! - Pete it will be okay... stay with me... - Help! Get some help! Get some help mate! Anyone! I need a phone! I need a phone! - Give me a phone! Give me a phone! - Give us a phone! Hey. Hello? Police Fire or Ambulance? - Hello? - Yes. Hello? Do you need police, fire or ambulance? Hello? Help, we need help, we need help. OK Miss, we'll get you some help. What's happened? We're on platform one, we're at the station... Please, you gotta get... ...my friend is dying. He's bleeding. Please calm down, Miss. I need you to tell me exactly where you are and what's happening. I don't know we're at the station and something... something ...took our friend. OK, please stay calm. You said you're at the station? Which station are you at? Help me... Somebody help me. What are you doing? Miss are you there? Which station are you at? - ...Get someone here. - Hello? Hello Miss? Hello are you there? Miss? Pete... Pete. Pete... I'm sorry... Pete... Yeah... it's kind of hard to... to talk about it now. But I didn't know he was dying at that point. You know, I thought we were all going to fine. I mean... it had been so difficult to get to that point where we got there, and then... you know I thought we were going to be okay, there was people around us, there was light, I... you know... I would have been doing more if I thought he was lying there dying. I... I feel that I could have done more to help Pete. You know, it's, um... it's easy to say that you would do things differently, you know. It just didn't seem... very fair. I got told by the first paramedics that, you know... they'd sort of given up working on him, they sort of... you know... took a while to get Nat away from him and uh, it slowly, slowly dawned on me about that point, you know, they sort of walked away from him and he was just lying there, and he wasn't moving, and I was... I just thought fuck. I felt... I feel... I feel responsible I don't want to say that I felt like it was my fault Peter Ferguson was pronounced dead at 7. 37am on 21st October 2007. According to the Coroner's Report he died from internal bleeding. I don't know exactly how I've changed since that night. I can't help thinking... we were so close, help was right there. I go over it again, and again, just constantly... What would I do differently? Natasha Warner resigned after the underground shoot. She no longer works as a journalist. I was just pissed off, with everyone. Everything. The government, the police, I mean, fuck, how much evidence do you want? It's just sad now thinking about it. It's pointless. It's just fucking sad. Steve Miller is still working as a news and current affairs cameraman. The whereabouts of Jim 'Tangles' Williams remains unknown. His family are still searching for answers. The police investigation was closed due to 'inconclusive evidence'. Despite several requests, no State Government or Police representative agreed to be interviewed for this film.
