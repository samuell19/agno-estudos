After the execution of famous outlaw Louis Mandrin, in Valence town square on May 26, 1755 his companions take the risk of another smuggling campaign in the kingdom of France. Over here. The bastard! We were right. Look. The bastard came this way. Two days he's had us chasing him. I'll have some water. Here, sarge. No time. Let's go. - C'mon! - Hang it, sarge. - We're closing in. - We're coming. Soldiers, on your feet! What are you doing? Good day. I'm out hunting. Is there a problem? This man belongs to us. Go away, please. Go away, please! I haven't taken him from you. He's dying. He needs treatment first of all. - What'll you do with him? - Not your problem. He's a deserter. A deserter? He's welcome to join my band. C'mon, sarge, let's kill him. Kill him! Let's go. We've wasted enough time here. Compress. Don't worry, son. You've tasted our medicine. If you see the devil in your dreams, he's one of ours. So are you now. Please! Many thanks, you're most kind. Thanks very much. I never thought I'd ride in a carriage one day! Jean Sératin, peddler by trade. The Marquis de Lévezin. My lord Marquis. I have here a few objects of wonder, pious images... Pamphlets against men of the cloth, newspapers from Amsterdam and London... Holy cards, quills, writing paper... A book, The Woman of Pleasure, and passages from... Intimate Jewels. Very interesting. And... do you know anything about... the Mandrin book? Sorry, my lord? The Mandrin book. I've none left. Really? How so? It sells that well? Yes. Could you help me find Bélissard? Bélissard is quite inaccessible, my lord. What's more, their camp and their movements are mysterious. Nothing is ever known about them, only hearsay. I have matters to discuss with him. The Minister of War told me he has posted extra troops along the border. Bélissard must be told. I believe he is planning... Excuse me. Are you unwell? As I was saying, I heard he was planning a new campaign to the west and that the King's Dragoons were indeed watching the borders. I am aware of that. I feel sick. Better now? I can't help you, I'm awfully sorry. My lord, can't we stop? I'm used to it. I don't feel well, my lord. It won't last long. My lord, I think I'm falling out. Driver! Stop. My lord, I don't feel well. I must get out. I can see that. I feel sick. I'll continue on foot. You can't just leave me. I'll pass on your message. Wait! There are things I must tell you. Seriously. I'll walk with you. My dear peddler! My dear peddler, I must talk to you. Go back to your carriage, my lord. Your driver's waiting. You're running away! I can walk fast, too. God damn it! My lord! My dear peddler! Where are you? Come along, I have need of you. I'm glad to see you. Come and see. Look at the state my feet are in. I overdid the walking. You were right. My good lord, you put me in a tricky situation. No, the situation's normal. Engendered by sore feet. Look! Are you wounded? I have no ointment with me. Rub well between... the tip... There! Thank you. Perhaps you'd carry me? - Send for your servants. - Sorry? Send for your servants. They'll be delighted to carry you. My servants... They give me nothing but bother nowadays. You treat them well? Yes. You hesitated before answering. Indeed. Do you feel guilty? On occasion. Do you pay your staff well? Reasonably. You give me great comfort. I enjoy being in your company. I'm very pleased to hear it. Every day, your servants come to dress you? Ever since you were a little boy? Of course. Don't you have any sense... a curious feeling... of incapacity? Actually, at the present time, I'm becoming aware of many things. - Really? - Many things. Won't you help me with my shoes? What do you expect me to do? Won't you help me up? Give me your hand, my lord. Give me your arm. Come along. - You're most kind. - A bit further. You're saved. "Saved" is a little strong. As for the Mandrins, leave it to me. If you ask me to find them, I'll go. But if I have you on my back, we won't go far. Gently. Thanks. Feeling better? Put this on, son. You're not a soldier now. What am I? You're The Hare. A smuggler. - Who's the chief? - There is no chief. You're in smugglers' paradise. What's your name again? The Hare. Very good. Come with me. Right... Does it hurt? A little. You were lucky. I know. I don't need your thanks. This is blackthorn. For its ability to hold the light. Remember it. Look, its fruit is excellent for our remedies. We'll see their fire from up there. Who goes there? I have a message for Bélissard. Come with me. That's him. Hello, Bélissard. Jean Sératin, peddler by trade. I have a message for you. Greetings, Sératin. Haven't we met before? We have. Where? In Besançon? Besançon, perhaps. Millau? What brings you here? I bumped into the Marquis de Lévezin. Lévezin, you say? An acquaintance of yours? Sit down. I think he'd like to... To meet you to discuss a book he's working on. He also mentioned the Dragoons were manning the borders. You ran into them? A good number. Regiments from Rodez and other provinces. Picardy? And more besides. - How do you know? - By their insignia. Say, are you selling... a book about Mandrin? - I am. - It is you? The Excise men told... You're proud of it? Not particularly, but I had little choice. Who says you're not a traitor in with the Excise men? Would I have trudged across these forests and plains to walk into the lion's den? Are you hungry? Yes. Hawk, feed him. Thank you... Hawk. It's hot! Move! Don't sit facing me. Yes, Bélissard. I'm very proud to be here with you all. I'd like to stay a few days, if you'll allow it. You'll be under our protection. And you'll taste our contraband. The Hare, taste this! Who might you be? I'm very honoured. I'm looking for... the Mandrins' camp. I'm looking for Bélissard. That's me. The Marquis de Lévezin. Comrade Lévezin, I was expecting you. Come, follow me. It's this way. You've been camping long? Since we were born. All the smugglers are here? Except you until now. You do me too much honour, Bélissard. A fine beast. Very fine. A real thoroughbred. He was flushed out by a Marquis! My lord Marquis is a hunting man. Of prey with fur, feathers or fully clothed. You want Mandrin's testament? Yes. I was told I'd find it here. So I came looking for you. I went to see him in prison. Before his execution. I'm pleased you're having a new campaign. I'm proud to be here with you. I'm writing a biography of Louis Mandrin. He confided in me at length. He mentioned his testament. I think we could... collaborate. We have written four songs in burlesque verse. Congratulations, gentlemen. Congratulations. Your accounts are for me a very precious asset. Of course. We don't need your sweet talk. It's not sweet talk. Well, we bid you welcome. I hope you will savour our hospitality. Bélissard, you... I think you're forgetting that I walked and walked... I walked far and wide to find you. Rest now. I wish you an excellent night. Up and out! The Mandrins are back! They bring plentiful treasures! Come and see! The Mandrins are back! Having braved the dangers of the Orient and the King's customs men, the Mandrins are back for another free market. Up the hill out of town, near the windmill, you will be safe under our armed guard to peruse our treasures. Silks, hunting gunpowder, clothes of all kinds, Savoy tobacco. And even books of the Reformation. And I, a humble peddler, under my comrades' protection, bid you welcome. I have for you quills and ink, scraggles, fine knives and spindles. And I have literature for those that can read. The Woman of Pleasure and passages from Intimate Jewels. I'll be at the windmill with my comrades. Come in droves! Come closer. Closer, good ladies. Yes, that one. I think the gentleman was interested. Try it on. It has short sleeves. Jean-Jacques Rousseau. Voltaire. Excellent choice. Buds of Mary-Jane! - Thank you, sir. - Well done. Here. Don't cross the line, please. Thank you and goodbye. See you again. Until the next time! It looks like silver. Let me see. Comrades! To Mandrin! To Mandrin! Long live smuggling! Talking of which... Mandrin in person gave me his political testament. He asked me to give it to you. I don't know why. Make good use of it. He was curiously fond of you. I know. I'll have it published. By which printer? Jean-Luc Cinan. - Cinan? - Yes. Hear that, comrades? A printer lives nearby. That's good news. Let's drink. Got a glass? Good health, comrades! Long Live Mandrin! Cheers! Bélissard, we've been expecting you. Here I am, as agreed. Allow me to introduce Jean-Luc Cinan, printer. Glad to meet you. As am I. You're like in my dreams. The same look in your eye. You dream a lot, sir. All the time. I understand. Our Chants de Mandrin. Les Chants de Mandrin. Poems in four songs in burlesque verse In memory of Louis and all those fallen in combat. Here's 100 ecus. For? 1,000 copies. Is it enough? Perfect. Your timing is excellent. More than you can know. I would be very happy to print these songs. In one week? One week? Don't even think about it. Next week. I cannot! One week? 500 in two weeks. Fine. 500 in two weeks. And the other 500, two weeks later. We'll be in Mende in two weeks. You can send someone. Mende isn't so far. And in one month, we'll be in Rodez. Your captain was there once. - Our captain? - I met him. You mean Mandrin? Of course. That's ancient history. Come... Yes, come and see how we make the paper, on which we'll print your poems. You make paper out of that? That's right. And then you add a little glue? Yes. Bone glue. And pork gelatin? Follow me, Bélissard. The attic allows air to circulate while blocking out any winds that might make the pages sway, which would hurt them. Neither northerly nor southerly. Neither mistral nor harmattan. Neither boreas nor zephyros. Just air moving imperceptibly between the pages. Wonderful! There you go. You see, I told you. There's no point worrying. You just have to observe your prey. You watch where he eats, where he sleeps, where he mates. Then you lay your traps. Always in the same place then? No, never in the same place twice. If the rabbit escapes, you won't lay a hand on him and all the rabbits will dodge your trap and that particular spot. - Seriously? - I'm telling you... Rabbits talk among themselves. You're funny people, you smugglers. Welcome to our world. We'll teach you about plants and wildlife. This is Lolotte. - She's beautiful. - She's stubborn. She's hungry. Two years old. She knows what she wants. She's out of an Arabian thoroughbred. An oriental stallion. This is an important mission I'm giving you, peddler. I'm trusting you with Lolotte. And I'm trusting you with Les Chants de Mandrin. You hear that? Right, I'll go to the printer's. His name's Jean-Luc Cinan. We ordered 1,000? And perhaps we'll order 1,000 more. Right. - Well, Roland? - It's going well. How many are you up to? I just finished the first copies. I'll show you one. Please do. There. - Good work, Roland. - Thank you. You always do a fine job but... I think our friends will be pleased. That's good. Million golden birds, O life force of the future! We can't deliver them like this. You know what we need? Yes, indeed. Discretion. I know that, like me, you're pleased that we're taking part in all that this represents. Keep up the good work. I won't stop. They're going to be so happy. We've got the books. Come on, we're just going through here. Come on. - Who are you? - Jean Sératin. What are you selling? Books, handkerchiefs... What merchandise is in here? - What's the merchandise? - Paper. Paper? Books, you mean! For the protestants! That's my mule. It's mine! Move, I said. Move! - My mule... - Stay put. That's my mule. Very well... Jean Sératin, you must necessarily be part of their band. Without doubt. Where are your friends? Not far! What did you plan on doing with these? Stow them away from prying eyes. Bélissard. Where is he? Where's Bélissard? I know no Bélissard. Careful, sergeant-major. My friends are strong and well-armed. - Is that so? - They have Brown Bess muskets. Brown Bess? What are they? You'll be dead before the bells toll noon. Hear that, lads? Let them come. You won't be laughing in court. I know. You'll die on the wheel. Like Mandrin and all the others. What an honour! The Earth mourns Mandrin its hero And blushes at being unworthy of such a fine soul Gone so soon... Yes, I want my body carried in triumph, exposed to the envious eyes of the masses. I want people to run from far afield to glimpse my remains. Poor martyr. Come on... - The wheel. - Come on, lads. To the cells. Long live smuggling! Long live Mandrin! "Reader, "Perhaps it's hatred you want me to... "invoke at the beginning..." Poems by Mandrin! Poems, my... C'mon, lads, burn them all. Not a single one left. No trace of them. What are they, sir? Forget it. You don't need to know. Is it poetry? I can't read. Good for you. Are there still some left? Stop there! Drop your weapons! Strip him clean. Bélissard! Hawk! Here I am! Get me out of here! Malysse! Here I am! Get me out of here! Stop whining! Step back. Calm down. Stop your sobbing. I'd given up hope. They hit me. I'd given up hope. Come on... We have to go. No rush, we're only starving. Food's scarce and women rare. What's your game? Pass me the bottle. Thank you. I have literature. In Chinese and Arabic. 1001 Arabian Nights, the unexpurgated edition. For the purchase of 1001 Arabian Nights, the sad life of Mandrin, songs in four volumes. A framework for the republic. Mandrin, tortured to death in Valence at the hands of the King's troops. Come forward! Les Chants de Mandrin. It's free! Here, my lovely. A framework for the republic. There you go, sir. The tumultuous life of our comrade Mandrin. Soap. Perfume, if you want. Raise the barricades! We're surrounded! Dragoons everywhere. We can't get away, so work fast! The Hare, over here. Out of the way, peddler. There's a brigade of them. Comrades, give no quarter. Give the damned dragoons hell fire! - The whoresons! - Bob tails! Varlets! For Mandrin! For joy! For the beauty of our dreams! Fire! It's over for today. Village men and women! Of priceless value... Les Chants de Mandrin! Come forward! The sad story of Mandrin. Songs in four volumes. Burlesque verse. Mandrin the smuggler. His life, his dreams and his hopes. Died at Valence on the wheel. The Guard, my friends! Here comes the Guard! Speak up, my lord. Comrades, I have written a lament in honour of Louis Mandrin. And all our comrades fallen in combat. We were twenty or thirty Brigands in a band All wearing white In the fashion of... Do you hear? All wearing white In the fashion... of merchants The first time I ever went thieving Was to filch the purse off... Do you hear? Was to filch the purse off a clergyman. I sneaked into his house Lord, it was vast! I found 1,000 sovereigns And took all of them I found 1,000 sovereigns Do you hear? I found 1,000 sovereigns and took all of them I went into one nearby Lord, it was high! With coats and robes I loaded three barrows With coats and robes I loaded... Do you hear? With coats and robes I loaded three barrows I went with all my wares To Holland at the fair I sold them for hardly any They'd cost me... Do you hear? They'd cost me not a penny Those judges in Grenoble In their long robes And square bonnets Soon handed down their... Do you hear? In their square bonnets Soon handed down their verdict They sentenced me to hang They sentenced me to hang How their words stang To be hanged and strangled I live in the shade of a bush My companions I live in the shade of a bush My companions My companions in misery Go and tell my Mammy Soon I will be gone I am a lost... Do you hear? Soon I will be gone I'm a lost son From my gallows I glanced Across all of France From my gallows I glanced Across all of France They convicted me! Long live the Marquis! Brothers, we are all outlaws, by choice or otherwise. Outcasts in our own land. We should be proud! When you see the cowards and rogues that govern us! But being outlaws forces us to be even more virtuous. Long live smuggling! Long live Mandrin! Music! Subtitles: Simon John
