I asked the Lord to bring my family back together again. And now that I have you back, I am not gonna let you go without a fight. Okay?

No, no, no, no, let me help. Let me help. What's up? Is it trig, or what's happening? -What? -Oh, Mama got the picture just -- what's this? Erica. I'll tell you. I'll tell you the truth. Hey, look, what's up? What's up with you? What you need, though? -I just got a lot of schoolwork. -How's school coming? -Going good right now, really good. -Yo, well, what's up? We need to get the homework cracking right now. What's happening? -Ty. -Huh? -You want to tell me therealreason you started smoking all that weed? -No. Look, um... Look, I ain't never really, uh -- I really don't talk about it that much. You know what I'm saying? And I never really told nobody. But you're the only one to ever ask me. Um, well, let's talk about you. You -- you -- you know, all these years, you've been trying to find out who your real parents are, right? -I've been looking, searching, praying... Just thinking to myself, "somebody has to know something." -Well, you ought to try being me. Got a father right here... And still... Ain'tgot a father right here. Know what I mean? Chania, I remember one time I -- I came home, and I walked right through the front door. My mom was sitting where you were. And -- and I said, "Ma, you know, I'm excited. Tonight's my championship basketball game." And she said, "Baby, I know." She said, "I done contacted all the family, your cousins, and everybody will support you. We're gonna show up tonight." Chania, when she said that, you know, I got excited, but the thing that really made me excited -- She said, "your father called and said he was gonna take off..." "...to come check his boy out." Man, when I got in the gym, I don't know -- I don't know what happened. I-I -- it seemed like something just -- From the inside, just exploded. I-I-I put up 45 points. I put up 45 points, broke school records. I heard everybody screaming, just, "Tyrone, Tyrone." And I got there and... Right in the middle of hearing all the cheering and chanting, looked in the bleachers. And sure enough, my mama was there... My grandmother, my sister, Erica. Even old Cletous came out. -[ Chuckles ] -I kept looking. The one person I needed to be there to see me... Didn't show up again. I was all-American. Not one time -- Notonetime... I've ever heard, "boy, I'm proud of you." Nothing. So, you want to know the reason why I do what I do? There it is. He ain't never been there for me, Chania, never. -Look, Ty... I know Uncle Marcus hasn't always been there for you. But God -- Godalwayshas, and he alwayswillbe. Now, all you got to do is take that first step. -First step? I'm -- I don't know how to take no first step. -You are like family to me, and I'm gonna help you. I'm gonna help you out. -Thank you. Thanks, Chania, 'cause I need it. I appreciate it. -It's gonna be okay. It's all gonna be okay. I better get back to that math homework. -Yeah, homework is good right now, yeah. Yeah. Chania! I think it's gonna be a little difficult to do homework without no books. -[ Laughs ] -Yeah, I think you need the books. -Yeah, I'll get it. -Yeah, that's -- -I'll see you later, Ty. -Study hard. -Keisha? This is Grandma Ulah May. Uh-huh. Do me a favor -- tell pastor I'm running a little bit late, but I am on my way, okay? All right, sugar. Thank you. Tyrone. Get up. -I'm not -- have you seen my glasses? -Get up. Stop, Tyrone. T-Tyrone. -My glasses -- um, they... -Now, enough is enough, Tyrone. Honey, I've watched you. It's time for us to talk. Tyrone, you are my flesh and blood, and I love you. But, honey, it kills me to see you throw your life away with that -- With that mess you been smoking. Baby, don't you know that, with every bad decision that you make in life, there's a price tag attached to it? Honey, it's affecting everybody around you. Now, listen, everybody makes mistakes -- Everybody... Even old Grandma. -Oh, Grandma, please, you don't make no mistakes, and if you did, you and God are cool. It don't even matter. -Please, son. Honey, I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of. Do you, uh -- You ever hear me and Cletous talking about a -- About Shay-Shay's, down on the corner of 45th? -[ Chuckles ] Yeah, I heard y'all talk about that a few times. -Meet Shay-Shay. Baby, I've done some things in my life I'm not proud of. That lifestyle had me drinking and popping pills, and, honey, I just saw -- I saw my whole life just spiral out of control. On the outside, it looked like I was having a good old time. But on the inside, honey, I was slowly dying. I got tired. I got tired of waking up hung over. I got tired of waking up, throwing up, and sometimes waking up in places I didn't even know where I was or who I was laying up next to. But then I remembered my mama. Mama said, "Baby, there's nothing you've done that God can't forgive. There's no place that you can go and God is not there. You can't be so far that the hand of God can't reach out and bring you back." Honey, my friends laughed at me, but I didn't care. 'Cause, you see, I tried everything, and didn't nothing work. So, honey, I fell to my knees. And I lifted up my hands toward glory. And I said, "Jesus! "I need you. "Jesus, I need you to take the taste of drugs and alcohol out of my mouth." That's when I began to feel joy in my spirit and peace in my soul. So, baby, all you got to do is call on Jesus. If you call him, he'll answer. Jesus. Jesus. [ Voice breaking ] Jesus!

[ Laughing ] -What's up, Chania? -Oh, my God. Ooh, hey. -Hey, these are for you. -Oh, my God, you are so sweet. -I try to be. -These are beautiful. -Hey, listen, um... Listen, uh... I just stopped by to say that, uh, I appreciate you... For kind of just sharing with me about God, and even when I don't think God is there, you told me that he is always there. And everything that you said to me, it really stuck with me. It's funny because Grandma came by and said the same thing. She said the exact same thing you were saying. And, uh... Um, yeah, I -- I care about you a lot. -I care about you, too. -Hey, you remember, uh, when we were young? We was riding the bikes -- you remember? We were riding in the middle of the street, having a good time. And there was a pothole right there, and you tried to get around that pothole and it didn't work. -[ Laughs ] I remember that. -And you hit the pothole, flew over the handlebars, and was laying out in the street. That was funny. That was funny. But do you also remember when I got off my bike... -Mm-hmm. -And I came to you and I got down on my knee... And I began to clean off your bruises? Do you remember that? -I remember it. -Chania, right then, I knew... That I -- that I had a special place for you in my heart. I knew it. And that's why I want you to come and do me a favor. -Uh-huh. -Come on. I want you to sit right here. Sit right here. Sit right here. Close your eyes. And I'll be right back. -Okay. [ Sighs ] Baby, tell me what it is. -Are you ready? -I'm so ready. Open your eyes. -[ Gasps ] -Chania... Will you marry me? -Oh, my God. Ty, this is beautiful. But... What about the family? -Chania, look at me. -[ Sighs ] -I'm not just on one knee. I'm on both knees... Asking you to marry me. Will you? -I don't know, Ty. You know I talk to God about everything I do. I just need to consult him first. -Nothing I can say about consulting God. That's fair enough. Listen... I got to go. Um... But while you're down there... Asking God to show you... Ask him to show you my heart. I love you. -[ Exhales slowly ] Ty... Wait. [ Sighs ] God says yes. Yes! I'll marry you! Yes, yes! -Girl, please! No, girl. Girl, he got $350,000. I only asked for $20,000. What you talking about? Well, after I mix it up, up and down, left and right, I'm gonna get another $20,000 on top of that after he hit this. [ Laughs ] Yeah, girl, they call me a cougar, but I'm a super cougar. [ Laughs ] Yeah, let's go shopping, girl. What you want? Mm-hmm. Yeah, I got them Gucci boots, Charlotte. Let's go get them other ones. [ Laughs ] Ohh! -Get off my phone. -[ Sighs ] Ohh. Oh, Mother. Yeah, what you want? What is it? -I want to talk to you. -Mm! youwant to talk to me. Really? After all this time that -- that I've been here, nowyou want to talk. Well, let's -- go ahead. -You the one that left out of here 18 years ago with a suitcase in one hand and a plane ticket in the other. Did nobody know where you were going or why. -[ Scoffs ] Well, let me tell you something, Ulah May -- I do what I want when I want and with who I want. -You better get your hand out my face 'cause I'm still your mama. Honey, I brought you into this world, and I will take you out. Margaret would never talk to me like that. -Hmm. I'm not Margaret, am I? [ Chuckles ] If I was Margaret, I'd have put your raggedy, old, rusty butt in a nursing home years ago. -Let me tell you something. I tried to see to it that you and your sister were well taken care of. When your father lost his job at the plant, it was me that worked my fingers to the bone, trying to see to it that you and your sister had clothes on your back and food on the table. All of those sacrifices I made for you. You would dare talk to me like that? -You know, you want to talk? Well, let's talk about something I ain't never talked about before. Let's talk about daddy. Let's talk about your husband. You want to talk? He was not the man that you think he was, mama. I'm gonna tell you. You don't know. Daddy used to touch me. -No, no, no. I don't want to hear that. -Oh, no, see, you don't want to talk now, do you, now when I start talking about something? He used to touch me. When you used to leave me alone with him, he used to touch me all over my body. -Child. -Yes, he did. I'm not lying to you. Why would I lie? -Baby, he loved you. -He used to touch me. Where were you then? -He loved you. -You want to talk now? -He loved you! Honey, I had to remind him that he had another daughter. He would say, "Ulah May, you take Margaret and leave Louise here with --" -[ Voice breaking ] "Leave Louise here with me." You can't e-- you can't even say that, can you? You can't, can you? [ Crying ] -Baby, I didn't know. Baby, I'm sorry. I didn't know. [ Voice breaking ] Baby, I didn't know. I wouldn't let nobody hurt you. I didn't know. -I know, Mama. I know. I know. [ Sniffles ] -Mama, oh, my God, I've got something to... Mama... [ Sniffles ] -Are you okay? -Mama, I'm sorry. I'm sorry. You didn't know, did you? -It's not your fault, baby. -Oh, I'm sorry, mama. -No, baby. But I'm here for you, okay? -We'll talk later. -Okay. -Go on to the back. Mama gonna make your favorite. -Okay, Mama. Mama, I love you. -Love you, too, baby. -Mama, is everything okay? -Oh, yeah. Yeah, baby, everything's okay now. Me and your grandma -- We just having a little heart-to-heart, that's all. [ Sighs ] It's gonna be all right now, though. What is it, baby? What's -- what is it? What's wrong? -Okay, you just sit back and relax. Here, let me fluff your pillows for you. Mom, I'm gonna make you a big dinner tonight. -Chania, what is it? -Well, I've been seeing someone real special for about three months now. -Uh-huh. -Mama... He's special? -Oh, yeah? But, uh, how come I haven't met him? -You'll meet him soon enough. Mommy, he asked to marry him, and I said yes! -What? Marry him? Marry him? He's a -- what is that? A ring?! Chania, you -- You haven't even talked to me about this yet. What is this? Honey, you -- Don't you think you're too young to get married? Mom, I know I'm young, but I promise we're gonna do this the right way. I'm still gonna go to school, and we're gonna get an apartment together, and we're gonna go shopping for an apartment and -- And we're gonna have kids and -- -Oh, wait a minute. Wait a minute. Hold on. Hold on. Wait a minute. Wait, now. Come on, now. What are you talking about? What -- D-does the boy have any money? -No. -Oh, see? No, unh-unh, no. -But his daddy does. -Oh! His daddy got money? -Daddy got money. -Ooh. Well, if the daddy got money, that mean he got money. That mean we got money. Ooh, money, money, money. Oh, I like him already. Oh, sit down over here on the small couch so I can hear everything. Tell me all about it. Now, what's his name? -[ Laughs ] -What's his name? -Ty. -Ty. Oh, that's a nice name. Ty -- Ty who? -Ty Gordon. -Ty Gordon. Ty Gordon? -Mm-hmm. Ty -- Ty -- Ty Gordon? -[ Chuckles ] -Chania, you can't marry your cousin. You can't marry your cousin, baby. -Mama, I love him. -Love? You don't know nothing about no love. Everybody needs love. Everybody love. Don't love nobody. What's love got to do with it? Love -- you don't know nothing about that. You know what? You are going to go find your cousin Ty, and you tell him that the wedding is off. You're not going to marry him, Chania. Now, that's -- that's a fact. -Well, let me tell you something, Louise -- I'm grown, I'm 18 years old, and I can do -- -No, you cannot! -Get off of me! You're not my real mother, anyway! I'm adopted! And I'm gonna marry Ty, and that's a fact! [ Exhales sharply ] -No, I'm just packing things right now to come on down. Oh, I'm sharp. No, I'm gonna be sharp. Yeah. Well, you know that O-Obama -- Well, he did done a crossover. They say I'm crossing over? Well, that's good. Well, you know, i-I -- White folks in Atlanta are all right with me. -Excuse me, um, Marcus. I need to talk to you. -John, I-I -- I got to call you back. Uh... I got an unwanted guest, and I -- Well, I-I-I'll talk to you about it later. H-Hold on a second. Louise, do you see me on the phone? -I know, but this is important. I'm not gonna leave here until you talk to me. John, tell them I'll be there in about 20 minutes. My wife's sister, and she's a bugaboo. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. All right. I'm gonna call you right -- I-I-I-I'll call you when I'm on my way. All right. Louise, can you tell me what it is that can't wait until I get off the telephone? That was one of my biggest supporters right there. -Okay, okay, look, Chania -- -You can't do white folks like that. -Chania came to me today. She told me she's been seeing this guy, this boy, for about three months and today he asked her to marry him and she said yes. -Marry him? -Yes. -Louise, you don't need me for that. -Yes. -You can handle -- She can't get married. She's too young. -That's right. -And she just started working for me, she just started college. Go back and tell her she can't get married to the boy. I told her that, but she will not listen to me. She won't listen to a thing that I have to say, so I -- you talk to her, please. -Louise, I don't have time. -Talk to her. She respects you, Marcus. Please talk to her for me. -Louise, young people don't listen to me these days. They got their own things now. They got the iPods and the Internets and the I.T.s and the TVs and the flat-screens. They're not -- they do their own thing now. -Marcus, she respects you. Now, I told her. -If she's made up her mind, Louise, there's nothing you can do. Young love is the hardest love. Am I right or wrong? -Yes, but, Marcus, please, now, just do this for me, just this one thing for me. I don't ask you to do too much. Now, just do that. Now, I told her everything you told me. -Louise, I got to get downtown. You talk -- listen... It ain't nothing you can do about it. -Marcus, please -- -All I wish is -- is for her to find a nice young man. Is the boy from a good family? -Yes. -Well, that's good. Is he a good Christian boy? -Yeah. -Well, that's good. Do -- do -- do they got some money? -Oh, yeah. -Huh. Hell, seem like she made a good choice. You know, a hard man is good to find, and a good man is hard to find! Listen, I got to get downtown, all right? Listen...call me -- -Marc-- Marcus -- -Listen, call me on my cell, Louise. It's good to see you, baby. -Marcus, it's Tyrone. -Tyrone who? -Gordon. -[ Laughs ] Louise, are you still smoking weed? She can't marry Tyrone Gordon. That's her cousin. -That's right. -Besides, Tyrone is -- is -- is -- She can't marry her cousin! Tyrone drinks, and he smokes weed and all that crazy stuff. -Oh, you don't even know your own son. He stopped smoking weed two months ago. -He did? Well, praise the Lord. Louise, look... They can't get married. They're cousins. -Yeah. -Wait a minute. Wait a minute. You're saying my son, Tyrone -- [ Laughs ] Louise, you are out of your mind -- Is marrying your daughter, Chania? Louise, I ain't got time for this. -Correction... -Listen, call me down the office, all right?-Ourdaughter. -Louise! Are you out of your damn mind?! Why would you come back in here with that nonsense?! They can't get married! They are brothers and sisters! Now, why would you come back in here after 18 years and bring up that secret? That's something that happened between you and i a long time ago. And that's where we need to keep it -- in the past, Louise. You will destroy everything I'm trying to build. Now, come on, baby. Now, you knew when we she got into that college you should have called me. You don't come back in here with this. You see how -- how we sold that thing to Margaret this morning? I acted like I didn't like you. Now, come on. Now, baby, listen to me. Look... It's good to see you. It's good to see you. Listen, listen, I got to go downtown and take care of some business. When I get back, we're gonna talk and -- and -- and, you know, we'll work this thing out. [ Laughs ] -Let's keep this between you and I. -Boy, Senator Marcus Gordon. Ooh, you haven't changed not one bit, have you? -You're damn right I haven't changed. I'm still taking care of you and I'm still taking care of Chania and that's one thing that will never change. Now, come on, Louise. Come on, baby, I'm in -- I'm in the middle of a re-election. And if this thing gets out, my whole life is over. Now, don't do this, okay? I'm begging you, please, now. [ Laughs ] I know that look. I know exactly what you need. I don't even know why we fussing about this. I know what you like, and you know how I do it. Obama done cleared the way for me, baby. Now, you gonna take this check -- $25,000. This is some of my campaign money, and you're not gonna say nothing about that, either. Listen. Listen. Listen to me. Listen to me. Listen to me. You talk to Chania. You take her out of the college down here, and you enroll her in any college you want to. I'll make some calls for you, okay? Now, we've kept this thing this long.

Ooh, I wonder how muchThe Enquirer would give me for my story. Oh, more than $25,000, I'm sure. -Louise, please... Don't play with me now. -I'm not playing with you, Marcus. -Don't come in this Goddamn house and play with me, okay? -Look, Marcus, I'm tired -- -Look, don't you come in here and take my life! Now, I'm not playing games with you, now. -I'm tired of living this lie. We've been going through this for 18 years. Now, I'm tired of it, now. -We went through it for 18 years, and we can keep it! -No, no matter what I -- you do not -- I am going to talk to my sister Margaret, and I'm going to tell her about th-- I don't want this money. -Louise, listen, do me a favor. -You know, just to show you I'm serious -- -Louise...please.

Don't -- don't do this. -No. -You think I'm playing games with you, don't you? You think I'm playing games with you, Louise? I don't care nothing about what you say. -I don't care about your reputation. -You think I'm playing games with you, Louise? -What?! -I swear to God. -Marcus, are you -- -Louise... If you come in here and you try to destroy my life, you won't walk out of this house, Louise. -M-Marcus -- -Louise, don't talk right now. Now, baby -- -But M-- [ Gasps ] -Louise, just listen to me.

He sits up high, and He looks down low. Louise, our God -- He sees everything that happens. He hears everything we say. Oh, sweet Louise, listen to me. Listen to me. -[ Inhales sharply ] -Sister, sweet sister, I've -- I've watched people like you. Sweetie, you search the whole world.

Now, look, if you take one step, my God -- our God -- He will take two. Louise, I am so proud to worship a God that's a God of second chances. Come on, pull yourself together. You have to do what's right, Louise. God -- He will give you strength, all right? I don't care what the problem is, no matter what the circumstances, Louise. -I know. -No, no, put it at the feet of Jesus and leave it there. I'm not talking about one or two. I'm talking about all your burdens He will bear, sweetie. So, all you got to do -- All you got to do is trust Him and believe that anything -- Oh, my God, anything -- He's got what you need. -Okay, I'll try. -He's got everything. -Well, we better do it right now, pastor. -Chania, hey.

Marcus. -Marcus who? -Marcus Gordon. -Louise! You're gonna come in this house and lie on my husband? -I'm not lying. -Oh, yes, you better be lying. -Oh, no, I wouldn't lie about a thing like that. Margaret, no. Mama, I'm... [ Voice breaking ] Honey, I'm sorry. I know you -- -[ Voice breaking ] How could you not tell me? -I-I don't know. -You've been lying to me all these years? -I'm -- just go upstairs. I'll come upstairs.

I -- -You ought to be ashamed. -I'll talk to y'all later. Just wait for me. Margaret, now, look, now, let me tell you -- No, let me just tell you as much as I can. Remember that women's conference that you went away that weekend, and you said to go by and check on your house? Well, I went over there to check on your house and Marcus was there and he'd been drinking and I started talking to him. And he was kind of nice to me and one thing just led to another and it just happened, Margaret. I didn't plan it. -Oh, it just happened. You're my sister, and you just happened to sleep with my husband. -Yeah. -Are you crazy, Louise? You know, Mama was right about you. I should have never let you come back in this house! You are the devil! And I want you out of my house! -I would never hurt you! -Louise! Cletous, you better show Louise the way out -- -Wait till Marcus gets here. -Before I lose my salvation! -When Marcus gets here, we'll know. -Louise! -Let's go. No, just wait for Marcus. He'll be home any minute. I know he will. And then we'll see what he has to say. Oh, here he is. Marcus, Marcus, you t-- Marcus, you -- you tell Margaret. Tell her. Tell her. -Tell Margaret what, Louise? What's going on in here? -Oh, Marcus, no, not another 18 years. It's the truth, Margaret. I would never lie to you! You know it! -Louise, what are you talking about? -You tell her, Marcus! -Get out of this house, Louise! -Louise, my wife asked you to leave. -Marcus. -I told you when she came here it was gonna be a problem, didn't it? -I'm not lying, Margaret. -You didn't listen to me. You didn't listen to me, did you? Can y'all just give me a second with my wife, please? Ulah May? Pastor, what's going on here? -Marcus, are you satisfied? -About what, Ulah May? -You have destroyed your family. -Ulah May, you know she makes up things. Come on, Ulah May. Y'all gonna let her come in here and tear our family apart? This is crazy. -I'll go get your medicine. -Cletous, please, give me a second with my wife. Baby, is this -- is this about the funeral? -You know this is not about the damn funeral, Marcus. -Well, what is it about? -She told me everything. -Everything like what? -She told me about you sleeping with her and that you got her pregnant... -And you you believe that? -And that Chania is your daughter, Marcus! -She's lying, Margaret. [ Scoffs ] Come on, Margaret. You gonna let her come in here and destroy our family with these lies? None of this started before she came in here. She's lying, Margaret. -And you're a politician, so I know you're a liar. -Don't do that, Margaret. Politics have -- have helped us for a long time, okay? Now, listen, I came home. We said we were gonna go to dinner. That's what we're gonna do, okay? Margaret, she's lying. -Marcus... You know, I've been nothing but a good wife to you. -You have, baby. -And I can't believe you would even -- You know what? If it wasn't for me and my family's money and me supporting your career, you wouldn't be half the man you are today. -Now, wait a minute. I've done real good by this family. You understand me? Everybody drives nice cars. Our kids go to the best schools. I've done the best that I can by this family, Margaret. Now leave it alone, okay? Now, I'm going upstairs to get ready for dinner and have a nice evening with my wife, okay? Jesus Christ. Why are you looking at me like that? -I'm trying to keep myself from killing you, Marcus. -Margaret, what are you talking about here? -I just -- I deserve to know the truth. -I told you the truth. -Because it's all making sense -- The reason you didn't want her back in this house. -I didn't want her here because I don't like her. And you went over my head and invited her down here. -No, you wanted to say, "Look at her. Look how good she looks. Look at her clothes. Look at her jewelry. Look at her car --" just to find out that you are the sugar daddy that's been taking care of her. Oh, Marcus. I just -- I can't believe you. -Margaret... When I first started, my career was hard. I-I-I mean, the country wasn't like it is now. I never thought we would even have a black man nominated for president. When I started in politics, there was nobody like me. And I worked hard, Margaret. You know that. And -- and I'm ashamed to admit it, but one night, I-I came home and I was drinking. And Louise was sitting there. And, Margaret, we started talking. And I started drinking, and we both were drinking. And then -- and one thing led to another, Margaret, and -- and it just happened. -So it's true. -But she doesn't mean anything to me, Margaret. -And so that makes it okay? -No, I'm not saying it's okay, Margaret. -No, no, it's not okay. -Here I'm thinking I have the perfect -- the perfect husband, the perfect family. I'm trying to be the perfect wife for you. And it's been a lie. -It hasn't been a lie, Margaret. -It's been a lie. I used to think you were the man of my dreams, Marcus. And you turned out to be my worst nightmare. -Margaret, don't say that. -I want you out of my house. -Louise, please don't say that. -Louise?! -No, no, no -- -Then you call me Louise? -Margaret, I'm so sorry. Margaret, listen -- -I want you to get out of this house right now, Marcus. Marcus, no, if you do not leave this house, I'm going to expose you for the lowlife that you really are. -Margaret -- -Yes, yes, yes, yes. -Margaret, this isn't -- -I'm gonna contact every newspaper and every constituent you think you could possibly have, every supporter, and I am going to expose you if you do not leave this house. -Okay, Margaret, just listen to me. If you do that, you will ruin my career, Margaret. Please just -- just -- -That's all you care about, is your career. -Just let me stay until the election is over, please. -M-Margaret, listen to me, the same thing I d-- The same thing I did for her, I did for you. Ohh! How dare you? I'm your wife. You're supposed to do for this family, Marcus. -You're right, Margaret. -[ Voice breaking ] You disgust me. -Just -- just let me stay until the election is over, Margaret. -Marcus. -I'm gonna go up and get my things, okay? -Cletous? -Margaret, don't do it like this, please. H-how am I going to get the rest of my things, Margaret? -I'll mail them. -Margaret, please just think about it. -Get out, Marcus. [ Sniffles ] [ Crying ] Oh, God. [ Sniffles ] Oh, Jesus. -Come on, Margaret. Don't -- don't cry, okay? It's gonna be okay. Now, now, now, um... W-weren't you the one that told me that, um, God never gives you more than you can handle? -Oh. That's -- that's before my family started falling apart. -Well, did, um -- d-did God change? -No. No. No. -Have you changed? -No. -'Cause I was scared you were gonna tell me yeah 'cause that's kind of confusing to a person who wants to be a new Christian like myself when you talk about God and everybody changing. God ain't no changer. He's... -Are you thinking about being a Christian? -Got to be something. -[ Sniffles ] Got to be something. -Look, Margaret, it's gonna be okay 'cause I remember something else you told me. You said that... God can fix anything. -Yes, He can. -He can fix this. -Yes, He can. -All we got to do is believe, right? -Yes. -Have some faith? -Yes. -Come on, baby. It's gonna be okay. Come on. Don't -- -Oh, Cletous, I can't believe this -- This has happened. -Come on. Don't worry about it, baby. -[ Crying ] -Oh, oh, wait. Now, wait a minute, Margaret. -I'm sorry. -You done got snot all over my doggone uniform, Margaret. Here. Wipe your nose. That's nasty. -I'm sorry, Cletous. Cletous. -Margaret. It's gonna be okay, all right? Margaret? -Yes? -I love you. -And I love you. [ Sighs ] Thank you, Cletous. [ Sighs ] [ Sniffles ] [ Exhales sharply ] [ Inhales deeply ] Oh, my God. [ Exhales sharply ] Cletous! -Ain't been like that in a while. Whew! It was really nice to spend some quality time with you. Well, it was really nice to see you dressed up tonight. Frankie Beverly Goddamn. Man, it was good to see you just doing your thing. Erica. Erica. -I'm sorry. What were you saying? -Damn, baby, your body's here, but your mind's on the other side of town. -Look, Jamal, we really need to talk. -You know what? I wanted to talk to you, too, 'cause there's some things I've been dying to tell you, too, you know? Like, I had a lot on my mind, and I just was like, "I should just tell her." -Yes. Me too. I've been holding a lot inside. -That's good, so we should just -- You know, mine ain't gonna take long. -No, no, let me go first. Let me get it out. -All right. -Okay. -You get it out. -[ Sighs ] -I'm listening. -[ Sighs ] You know, now, don't get me wrong, but, um... I love everything you do for me, you know? I love the jewelry. I love the gifts, the money, the trip to Saint-Tropez. -That was fun. -Yeah, it was. But, baby... When we make love... Something's just not right. -Wow. I was thinking the same thing. What's not right? -[ Chuckles ] Believe it or not... I'm ready to settle down. I want to be loved and -- and cherished and treated like a queen. -[ Chuckles ] Wait a minute. So, you -- You saying you ready to be loved... -Yes. -And cherished... -Yes. -And treated like a queen. Now, Erica, you and I both know you're not ready for a commitment 'cause you are too damn selfish. It's always about you, you, and what you want. -What is with you all of a sudden? -What do you mean, what's with me all of a sudden? I done told you you cannot turn no ho into a house-- -What did you just call me?! -Did I stutter? -The hell with you, Jamal. -Did I stutter?! -The hell with you! -I mean, come on, now. Face it, baby. I mean, I enjoy spending time with you 'cause you my bottom. You know what I'm saying? But I take care of you. -So what? -"So what?" "So what?" Is I'm doing you a favor. -I am doing you a favor, too, little man. -[ Chuckles ] That's real creative, Erica, real creative. But don't get mad at me 'cause your young ass is stretched out like a hula hoop. As a matter of fact, I can go down to Castle Street and find somebody just like you, and it wouldn't even cost me as much. -You don't talk to me like that. -Matter of -- You better calm down 'cause, as a matter of fact, I'm overpaying you. -[ Chuckles ] You haven't paid [bleep] yet. Wait till this baby is born. -I done told you that's not my baby. -You don't touch me. -I done told you that ain't my baby. -You're the only one I slept with without a condom, Jamal. -Yeah, right. -Now, you wait till I take you to court because child support is a mother. -You better stop talking. -And we'll see who pays up then. -I'm tired of hearing your mouth. -We'll see who pays up then. You back away from me. -You better stop -- -You bet-- [ Intro to Teddy Pendergrass' "Love TKO" plays ] -♪ Looking back ♪ ♪ Over my years ♪ ♪ I think I've shedded some tears ♪ ♪ Told myself ♪ ♪ Time and time again ♪ ♪ "This time I'm gonna win" ♪ ♪ But another fight ♪ ♪ Things ain't right ♪ ♪ I'm losing again ♪ ♪ Takes a fool to lose twice ♪ ♪ And start all over again ♪ ♪ Think I'd better let it go ♪ ♪ Ohhhh, yeah ♪ ♪ Another love T.K.O. ♪ ♪ What you say about it, yeah ♪ ♪ Think I'd better let it go ♪ ♪ Let it go ♪ ♪ Ohh, ohh, ohh, ohh ♪ ♪ T.K.O. ♪ ♪ Tired of getting beat up by love ♪ ♪ Tired of getting beat up by love ♪ ♪ Ohhhhhhhhhhhhh ♪ ♪ T.K.O. ♪ ♪ Ohh, ohh ♪ ♪ Ooh-wee ♪ ♪ Oh, yeah ♪ ♪ My, my, my, my ♪ ♪ My, my, my, my ♪ -♪ Promises we don't keep ♪ -♪ Ooh, yeah ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ ♪ Can't eat nor sleep ♪ -♪ Oh, whoa, whoa ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ ♪ We don't keep ♪ -♪ Whoa, whoa, girl ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ -♪ My love, my love, my love ♪ -♪ Can't eat nor sleep ♪ -♪ Why can't I get it right? ♪ ♪ I've been in love before ♪ ♪ And it let me down ♪ ♪ But now I'm all grown up ♪ ♪ No turning back, girl ♪ ♪ But like a child's heart at play ♪ ♪ You know the things we used say ♪ ♪ Oh, when we were in love ♪ ♪ We made... ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ -♪ Oh, yeah ♪ -♪ We don't keep ♪ ♪ Promises, promises ♪ ♪ Can't eat nor sleep ♪ -♪ N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-N-No ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ -♪ Ohh ♪ -♪ We don't keep ♪ -♪ Ohh ♪ ♪ Ohh, yeah, yeah ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ ♪ Can't eat nor sleep ♪ -♪ It seems no matter what I do ♪ ♪ B-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-ad luck ♪ ♪ Has been my best friend ♪ ♪ And now to me ♪ ♪ Now to me, those words you say ♪ ♪ They are just promises once again ♪ -♪ Promises, promises ♪ ♪ We don't keep ♪ ♪ Promises, promises ♪ -If I could just get one woman in this world... -♪ Can't eat nor sleep ♪ -To not look at me for my money... -♪ Promises, promises ♪ -But to truly just love me for me.

Have a good life. -What? Wait. Kevin, Kevin, no, no, no, no. Now, let's talk about this. Now, I know the other day -- But it's not what you think. I'm sorry. -You're sorry? Erica, you're pregnant by another man, and all you can say is you're sorry? -Babe, just give me another chance. I can make it r-- -There's not going to be another chance, Erica. There's not gonna be another chance. You don't know -- You just don't know how hard it is to try your best and your best just ain't good enough. -Kevin, stop. -Stop? -No, just -- -Stop?! Erica, that's what you should have did when you was running around here sleeping with everybody. Then you want to come back to me like you ain't done nothing wrong. You know what? Sounds like to me, Erica, you ain't nothing but a classy ho. -Look, baby -- baby, look, look -- Look, we can just make it all -- -No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. Let's just call it what it is. I mean, you got your needs met. What about my needs? What about a need to have a woman I can respect, one that I can trust? I can't trust you as far as I can see you. -Baby. Baby. -Don't touch me. -Look, I just want it the way that it was. I don't want that. I want you. I love you. -Love? [ Laughs ] Erica, you don't even know the meaning of the word. God gave us the real meaning -- "For God so loved the world that he gave." "He gave," Erica. I can't give you a ride in an expensive car. But, Erica, I gave you a ride on the inside of my heart. I don't confess to be a smart man. But I'm smart enough to know that in order to receive love, you got to give it. -Kevin, wait. Now, you mean to tell me this ring means nothing to you? -[ Sighs ] -Now, I know -- I know I messed up. Everybody messes up, and I'm not perfect. But I need you. I cannot go through this pregnancy by myself. I love you. I love you. I love you. Please. I love you. Don't. -You know what? You -- You're right about one thing. This ring does mean a lot. It took me a year to save up for it. So I'm gonna just take it. -[ Gasps ] [ Whimpers ] Never did -- it didn't mean nothing to you, anyway. [ Scoffs ] Oh, yeah, you know what? You told me that I would never get a record deal, right? [ Chuckles ] Guess what. Your boy Diddy signed me yesterday. And I didn't even have to make the band. So, I guess the saying is true -- Good things come to those that wait. I waited on that record deal, and I finally got it. [ Chuckles ] Bye, Erica. Oh, oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. Got a little something for you. This is for your boy Jamal. That's for the shoes he bought me. For the clothes he bought me. That's for my raggedy-ass car that he got fixed.

Ulah May -- Cletous, stop it, now. -Okay, let me just tell you something, boy. You come down here to General Hospital... 'cause your life feels like a little soap opera. You come down here to see all your children. But remember, boy, you only got one life to live. But know this -- Let something else happen to these people, and I'm gonna stab you.

Oh, I guess you loved her so much, you slept with her sister, huh? -Tyrone, please, please, son. -That's a lot of love, Pop. -Son, that was a long time ago.

We know that. -Son, please, leave it alone, okay? -Do I have to tell you again, Pops? I'm not leaving it alone. Look what you done done, man. It's because of you. It's because of you -- this whole thing. You're the reason I started getting high in the first place. And you want me to leave it alone. -Tyrone, I'm sorry. Son... Son, listen to me, son. -Hey, hey... -Son, listen to me. -Tyrone. -Listen to me. Listen to me, son. There's a lot of things that happen between adults that young people don't understand, Tyrone. I made a mistake, son, and I'm sorry I wasn't there for you in the early years when you were growing up. But you're my son, Tyrone, and I love you, son. I love you. -You better get off me. You better get off me. -Come on, man! -No, no, get up! -Ty, don't hurt him! Don't hurt him! -Get up! Get up! -Come on, Ty.
