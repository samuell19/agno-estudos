When we used up all money you can practice against the mirror Don't look at me, I'm not the hands on type And, next time you can load yourself with the chains and only wake me up after you finish jogging I am really late... With your size, you are best with the medium range boxing style That is when you get near the opponent, to use your punch, your knee and elbow to knock him down In order to get near him, you must have solid defense Now, you must learn to watch the punches Never close your eyes Even when you're punched in the face You must keep your eyes wide open Hold his head Good, let him go Are you out of your mind? You told me to get near and punch Right! Den, practice the knee and elbow with him I am about to go into the tournament I can't lose Come, let's do a few more rounds Go ahead and practice with the sand bay for now It's my first fight on Saturday I hope to see you there There is nobody to help you inside the ring I can yell as hard as I possibly can You won't even understand a word It's all up to you Ken Wong, ready for the next match Concentrate Just think about knocking him down There is no strategy Trust me You can knock him down with 50% of your power No punching at the crotch No punching behind the head "Fight" is to start the match "Stop" is to stop fighting OK?

My family are leaving tonight I was gonna ask them to watch my fight I just couldn't say it Things are hard to express when you don't want to say it Nobody understand me Why? I asked my dad not to put too much pressure on my studies He said he didn't He didn't realise that he's a professor and my mom is a high school principal My sister had excellent academic results There is nothing else on her mind! I don't want to be measured By their set of standard That was too much for me Tell me about you My family never push me to study In fact, my whole family is illiterate I was doing poorly at school when I was a kid I didn't want to live an average life like my family did I really want to know what the world was like out there So I studied real hard My father used to be a fish hawker He passed away when I was 14 Mom said he's a strong man He alone could knock over 6 to 7 hawkers in the market All I remembered was his big hands touching my cheek With an overwhelming smell of fish My brother still touches my cheeks the same way Bye Bye Bye Bye bye Please don't stare at me like that I wouldn't want to go home then Bye Bye I don't want to let you go either What did you say? Bye! You're really late! Pam's been calling for you You should return her call Alright This is really dangerous I want to see you a bit longer Aren't you tired with that endless kissing? You're right, I wonder why I still love it My mom's home Are you out of your mind? Don't worry, there's no men outside Isn't there another fitting room? We're good friends; I don't think you'd mind? Why do you need that padded bra? Is that for him? Don't you start with a dirty mind, OK? Are you in love with him? No Are you? No... Tell me, is it true? Yes... yes Yes... yes What is it? Gloria, men are not loyal Gays often change their partners Only women are loyal to their love But you can't force people into a relationship Oh! I really want to beat you up Do you know where's the mole on her back You don't even know when is her period! That's enough, Pam Gloria, but I really love you! This is not going anywhere! I like men You two can stay as friends Shut up, I don't need your advice Gloria, are you going to pick him or me? I don't want to go home So where do you want to go? To your place Why? I want to know if I really love you Why is there only 1 fish? I didn't have time to take care of them They died one by one It's the only survivor It's so lonely! That's not too bad He's got the whole world by himself He needs not to care about other's opinion What an introvert! Come and feed him everyday I shall cook you for dinner You are sick! I'm hungry I'm hungry too I want to know if I really love you or not One two three Fight! Stop! How exciting! No punching at the crotch and behind the head "Fight" is start the match, "Stop" to stop fighting Don't press too hard, he was once your master It's OK to lose Ken, are you ready? We're waiting for you Can you get me a towel? Let's shower together, come on You're bad! Stop it now! Brother We didn't do anything Rocky Is Rocky Chan of Flying Dragon Club here Yes You're next, get ready I wanna challenge you It's only a joke, it is not time yet Winning a few matches won't make you a champion I'll play along, you ask for it! Let's go, I have my next match fixed Don't look at me Don't ask me anything I don't know what to do What do you want from me? I shall fight with your brother on the coming match Why? I shall meet him in the ring anyway Excuse me Next please It is just a matter of time You didn't even care about my feelings You're afraid that I will heat him I'm afraid you may lose I can never compare with your brother Deep down within your heart What color of clothes did I wear when we first met? I forgot Of course you forgot Because I bear no significance in your heart Disgusting! This straight stride kick is one of the toughest ones by Rocky Chan And is especially formulated for mid-range fighter like you This would keep you away from him Moreover, you can only take a few of this kick Rocky Chan would land this 3-4 times harder than this one What should I do then? You may stand a chance if you can trade 1 for 1 I don't get it Try to land me a kick When he kicks you you use the other leg to block his powerful kick You got 100% of the force but he would also get 60-70% back And if the power of his right foot diminishes then you may have a chance to get closer for your attack The question is... are my legs as strong as his? Sure! Master Hung, I've got some snack for all of you Den, take a break Thanks Master Hung Thanks Master Hung, please Have some dessert I thought you want me to loose some weight? Please tell her that I cannot eat He is on diet And I'm trying to put on some weight Master Hung, please tell him that if he doesn't eat now he will never get his dessert from me You tell her that I've had it already He's had his dessert already Master Hung Please tell him fight hard, and not to lose big time Master Hung, please tell her that I shall never lose Please tell him that he'd better not Please tell her that I shall win I shall leave now Bye!

You better ask him yourself I taught him all I know Go in Ken, I wanna talk to you Yesterday I... I thought you'd never come You thought I don't want you to win? But he is your brother Don't worry, I am still very confident I am telling you I care about you most I want you to win Give it your best! Hi, John John Rocky, let's chat for a while Leave us alone The odds are for you to knock him out in the first round Let him stay alive for a few more rounds And I will make over a hundred thousand in cash There will be a cut for you OK?

No You silly You should go now Tell him to give it his best I was gonna tell you in the changing room that we had a baby But you don't give me a chance to tell you I understand that all fighters will meet in the ring As a woman I would, for some silly reasons hope that this day will never come Stop!

How dare you to come here? Don't you get near here! Get out! Now! We're gonna kill you if you get over here Kill him! Please keep quiet at a time like this It's your own decision You should tell him yourself The court has ruled this as an accident they will understand, eventually Master Hung Ken is indeed a quality fighter with talent You should get him back in the ring immediately He has defeated Rocky Chan We should let him represent HK at the Asian Boxing Championship Ken's situation is rather special He is not suitable to attend any fights You sure have proven you are the real champ here Why don't you attend in our fights instead Nobody is responsible for any inquiry or death! Less regulations and more exciting fights Cash reward is over ten times more than a regular tournament We are not interested in underground matches I'll do it I seem to hear two opposite opinions here I am his trainer Nobody can stop whatever I decided Take care of yourself What's your name? Gloria Chan Do you know the name of doctor performing the operation? Dr. Keith Wong Do you know what kind of operation is that? Abortion Gloria Chan, the operation is over Here's a specimen Ring the bell if you need anything It appears that there is a clot of blood in your brain How did you injure yourself? Boxing I was injured during a fight It is possible that the vascular tube had ruptured Which cause the blood to clot here You must undergo more examinations in the hospital now Don't worry this is only the initial It may not be that serious Nurse, please arrange admission registration for him Yes I can walk myself I will go to registration myself Ken, we're closed now It's time to go Willy, you can go home first People call me Benson I was once 3 times boxing champion I know that Take a look at me now The doctor asked me to quit drinking I suggest you to stop fighting like this It's leading no where Fighting in the underground boxing world no gloves and no protection I like the feeling with flesh Image your head as a water-melon? Punching it with your bare fist You can check the water-melon afterwards It's gonna be all mushy inside out My hands illustrate the point best You don't think it's worth it? I never thought about it that way When it comes to sports One would get tennis elbow by just playing tennis There's bound to be injured in any sports I would probably be a site foreman if I didn't pick up boxing But I would not think I am that outstanding I would have made more money But it is the cheers by thousands of fans for you The special feeling in the ring I was once the best boxer I did it! I got fame and glory in my life once! And that's enough My wife still couldn't understand this feeling Ken, the best I can do is the champion of Hong Kong You should continue your training Represent Hong Kong and get that Asian championship! Rocky Chan and I won't be able to do it! Too bad Ken Your nose's bleeding Stop those underground boxing now Take care of yourself Excuse me, miss, I'm from an Ad.

I won't forgive him You know I am stubborn I know I have your genes, you know Yamada Motokazu is an all rounded fighter Whether it is short, medium or long range His power of attack is surprisingly consistent Notice that before he land his punch his shoulder would retreat a little Don't bail out! Instead you should thrust forward Try punching me now if you thrust forward He can only have 50% of his power out If you simultaneously thrust forward with a punch and landed on him do a little maths of physics, and you'll understand? You'll get the upper hand Are you OK? I am fine Can't go to sleep?
