Well played Gian! G&T? Walter Hankins, as I live and breathe! Thank you. What brings you to these parts? Surely not covering amateur polo these days? Well, I was rather hoping I might find you here. How's your father? As far as I know, still trying to crush the independence movement. How's yours? As far as I know, still rotting in his damn British mosilleum. Ah, wicked girl. I'm surprised they keep you on at the Ministry. Ah, daddy's legacy. At least when he left me behind he did me the service of ensuring I'd never be out of a job. Scorching weather for game. - Brilliant! Did you enjoy it? - Yes! Well done! Thank you. Bad luck. We'll get you next time. Ah, well you'll need a faster horse. So... Do you mind Max? Your regiment is required to report, immediately. I suppose that's it then? Imagine my baby brother leading you into battle? - Daddy's legacy. - Yes. Lieutenant Stillwell, this calls for drinks all around. I think I'll join you boys in an ice tea. See.. there in lies the reason I could never make it as a Sikh. No G&T, and not enough hair to hold up a hat. Na Wait, wait wasn't it last month that you were complaining you could never make it as a Buddhist? I will write you first thing. - Memsai - Oh, yes, yes of course. It's time to go. Okay? Oh, wait! I want to take a photograph. - We have to go. - Just one, please? Alright! Oh, no, come on, come on, let's all be in this together. Come together. Look in the camera. Okay. - Oh, it's stuck! - We have to go. - Perhaps, I could be of assistance? - Walter! Walter did a nice piece about him for the Times. There was one final thing, your brother said to me before he died, Memsai. Talked to the end, that sounds like him. He said, you should go home back to England, where you belong. Belong? Good lord, do I belong there now? My father went back to England after mother died, if I didn't belong there then, why now? I should go. You're out after curfew, you'll have to keep off the main streets. Things are changing here Memsai. Will you stay on, in the army I mean? No Memsai. I'm going back to Sirsa. Of course your village in Punjab. That's where you belong isn't it Gian? Goodbye Memsai. Oh, Andrew. Don't lose it. My mother gave this to me when I was five. - Was I five Megs? - I think so. Seems I was prone to wandering off, but you were supposed to mind me. I could never find you, hence the whistle. Thank you. He's going to be trouble I can promise you that. Why they made him an officer is beyond me. English blood. Just enough to put me in charge of my betters. Don't worry Memsaiheeb, nothing will happen to him. Avtar and I will be watching. Muslim migration to Pakistan Not far. Not far to go now. Habu. Why don't you take some rest for a while. Have some water, sit down? Please, sit down. - Alright. - Please Habu. Go. Come on Habu. Ah. Mommy. Naseem! Naseem run! Avtar? You're up early this morning. - Hey, we must talk. - So talk. I watched you yesterday, busy with your farmer's work while the others did your share. My share? Of what Avtar, killing innocent people? They got what they deserved. There's no compromise for me. You dissappoint me old friend. I don't think you are in a position to judge me. I have work to do. You didn't hesitate in Burma. The war is over. The war is never over. That was made for a soldier. Please. Take it. It's cold out this morning. Please, please, I'm not going to hurt you. Enough. You can't stay here. You must come with me. Gian. In the army, we were told that warm feet and a full belly were all a man could expect. But when I am the chef, starvation is a guest at the table. You should eat. Gian. It's only noon. You decided not to sleep in today. I've given you all morning to repair your goods. Last week your rice... I know, I know, Sapedey? Puts stones in my rice again. - Buy from someone else. - If it were that easy. You know about the recent killings? A third of red lentils and 2 thirds of split peas. It was bloody. Very close to the village. I hear many Muslims died. Festival of holy, is not for weeks. - What are you celebrating? - 40 yards please. This colour is not for someone your age Gian. You're constantly surprising me. Come, you must see a train's just arrived from Pakistan. We need more men. Men who are soldiers, Gian. Come and join us. I can not Avtar. Mother. Where have you been? - How long have you been here? - I've been looking for you. Rani's son was on the train. The whole family, all of them, together. Huh, and now dead. Poor Rani. These Muslims... How can they murder innocent people? They are butchers. I hate them. Oh, good son, I am so glad you are not involved. Go to Ran, do what you can for her. She's your closest friend. Have to find a better place to keep you. I'll get some water. - That was your mother? - Yes. I would like to see my mother, my family. In the past 24 hours, looting and rioting have taken a turn for the worse. Thousands of innocent refugees on both sides of the border in the state of Punjab have been slaughtered. The cities of Lahor and Anrivtar are burning. There appears to be no semblance of law order as the newly formed government in New Delhi is unable to offer any immediate help to bring the bloodshed to an end. Gandhi had nothing to say to reporters on the day India received her independence. The same independence he has devoted his life to win. The two nations into which India is divided remain for millions inside the... Refugees must have changed their path to the border. I'm sorry. I'm not going back. It will be light very soon, we must return. I'm not going back. You have been good to me. - Where are you going? - To Pakistan! It's the other way. Thank you. Please. - What is your name? - Naseem. - I am Gian. - I know. Tomorrow, we can try again. If I'm not seen in my fields people will ask questions. Please. Put the fire out after I leave. Open the door. Open the door. We know you're inside. Break the door down. Where is the Muslim woman? She's a young girl. She's not responsible for anyone's death. How can you harbour one of them After all they have done to our people? - She hasn't done anything. - I will tell you hasn't done anything my son, his wife, his children, my grandchildren. Murdered by bloody Muslims. How dare you hide one of them among us. You know what they did to our children on the train? She contaminates our village. Bring her out. You will not touch her. I want her out now. If you step into my house, one of us will die. Then you bring her out. Someone must pay. Don't let them take me. Kill me now. Please. You were a soldier Gian, you won't let me suffer. Please Gian, you are a kind man. It would be easier for me, it would be easier for me, please. - Kill me now. - Wait. There is still hope, please trust me. This is all I have. I hope it will be of some help. For those people who have to leave everything behind in Pakistan. More than 500 rupees my friend, maybe more. Let this be an inspiration to all of us. What good is any of this? How will you live with the blood of my family in your hands? May Lord Vishnu, smile on our people. May hell be on this house. We should help, whatever we can, settle our people. Thank you, thank you. Thank you. You're a fool Gian. Why this Muslim girl? Why? And you are still hanging onto this? Let go of your old memories Gian. The boy is dead. You lose yourself. Please mother. Please! Sarge! Sarge! You could have been killed today. I was a soldier for a very long time. You gave them a lot of money. You should sleep. I see you've still got your bicycle Miss Stillwell. Gian! What in the world are you doing here? You alright? I've been so worried with all the fighting and killings. I hope you like fresh punir. How lovely. - As long as I am not the cook. - Ha, of course. Thank you, Ram. Come, please. It was a slaughter. Perhaps the family survived. Where were they going? - To a village near Lahor. - You mentioned they were from Delhi. There is a chance the local authorities may... have a record of their family's next of kin in Pakistan. I promise, I'll do whatever I can to help. I'm not without some influence. Daddy's legacy you know? But I'm not optimistic Gian. You must know how it is these days. To track down the family would be a miracle. Miracles do happen Memsai. Yes, they do. Indeed they do. I should be getting back to catch the last train. Please take these for the child. I couldn't Memsai, you've been much too generous already. I insist but you must promise to come back and bring me more of your fresh punir. And Gian, no more Memsai, please. Thank you. You will be hearing from me, I promise. Where's my son? - He isn't here. - I see that. He is gone, to New Delhi. He went to see the English lady. Gian thinks that perhaps she can help to locate my family. Good, I'm glad to hear that. Here's the suit he asked me to make. My son doesn't want a woman to clean for him. He doesn't like anyone touching his things. Mamagee. Ah, mother. This looks wonderful. Thank you so much. The house looks so clean. Thank you. - Gian, let me get the water. - No. As long as you're inside this house no one will touch you. Everyone knows I'm here. They watch your house. When you are not here, I am alone. Let them see who their enemy is. I'll get the water. Hey, hey, hey, hey! How dare you come to our well. There is no water for you here. Go and get it from Pakistan! Leave her alone Rani. And take her along with you. Water belongs to everyone. Then let her go to her own well, okay? She draws water for my son's house. Here... - Did you hurt yourself? - A little. Thank you. - This is a surprise. - It's a field of mustard isn't it? So beautiful. Do you know what you need? - What? - A red turbin. Imagine the red against the blue sky and the yellow flowers. - I haven't got a red turbin. - Too bad. I made something different today. My mother never taught me how to cook. She said school work was more important. And all I ever wanted to do was sketch or paint. Fortunately I can just eat about anything. Yami is good for that. - The only thing I can't stomach is... - Squash and chepati's. - And in this one? - Dessert. It's made with saffron and almonds and squash. What was the only thing? That you couldn't stomach? Squash. Now don't tell me. Let me guess what we're having for dinner tonight, huh? Mr. Sharma! Ah, Miss Stillwell nice to see your lovely face, are you looking for me? I'm still waiting for a response to my request. For goodness sake. You told me you would take care of this. The little Muslim girl. Ah, yes, yes. I remember the case. The Muslim child and your Sikh friend. Mr. Sing was in my brother's regiment Mr. Sharma, he is not as such my Sikh friend, he is however, entitled to a response from the Indian government. Miss Stillwell, the ministry in charge of the unification of families have had thousands of enquiries. I have a close friend who writes for the Times of India. Perhaps he'd be interested in writing about your lack of interest. Ah, very well Miss Stillwell, I'll attend to it personally. Just send me another copy of the letter. There. Good day Miss Stillwell. Gian! - Give that colour to me. - No, I don't think so. I think so, See you need one hand free to lay that colour onto people. - Okay, here. - Ugh Oh. This is wonderful. Nobody staring at me. Nobody watching me. Today, nobody knows who I am. But I do know. You must go say hello to Rani. - Don't you dare. - I do dare. You must. - Manjula, no, Manjula please. - Just wait, I'm getting her for you, okay? Rani! Na, uh. Gian. That's enough. Enough! Naseem! Come, come. Come. Nobody will hurt her again. Chum? Naseem? There was so much blood. No one could get away. My mother, my family. It's alright. You are safe with me. You should rest. There is still no word from New Delhi. You will have to decide. I don't know what to do. She can not stay here forever Gian. Shokria. A letter.. From New Delhi. May I? Dear Gian, I am sorry for not writing to you earlier regarding your request. I am pursuing the matter through the Indian government. Mr. Sharma the officer in charge of the refugee relocation branch of the home ministry has personally assure me that this will be his top priority. I assure you, it's just a matter of time and I'll have news for you. Once again, Gian, I can't thank you enough for taking care of my dear Andrew. Margaret. Sir! Gian! Sir! My legs, I can't feel my legs. Sir! I can't feel my legs. We will get you out. Hold on. Help! Help!! Break! No! - Don't let me drown. - I will get you out. - No, no. - I will get you out. Don't let me drown! - Look at me. - Please don't let me drown. I can't hold it. - Look at me. - I'm so scared. I don't want to drown. Release my legs Gian. Please. - Go! - Ah! Please Gian... please. You promised Maggie you would take care of me. Please. - We must leave. - Please. Please. Who was Andrew, Gian? Her brother. Avtar and I promised to protect him. He died. He was drowning. I had to shoot him. Andrew. I love you Gian. Perhaps if I talk to some people at the Ministry? Yes. That would be wonderful. I'm just so happy you're back. I haven't been able to make any headway at all. Well, actually I'm only here for another couple of weeks. I have to get my permanent papers. - For England - England, no. No, not, England. Lahor, Pakistan. It's interesting how times have changed. Thanks to my ancestors, Lahor's a foreign country now. Well, we'll be neighbours. Our department has been selected as translating representatives in the joint Punjab legislature in Lahor. I've been asked to attend for a time. Can't imagine why they've asked me. - You must stay at my hotel. - Hotel? My family has graciously left me management of the Hotel Royale. From journalist to hotelier. I'm not sure whether that's a step up or down. Well, the paper is losing a good man. Your words gave me great comfort after Andrew died. I would never had imagined Andrew a hero. Did you ever think of going back to England? Surely you must have some family there. Losing Andrew was losing my connection to my English side. I'm afraid I just wouldn't fit. - You would fit in no matter where you were. - It's like a size 36 in a size 38 shoe. Thank you, Walter. I'll be at the Ministry tomorrow. I'll talk to Tappty Then. Until Lahor. Until Lahor. Yes, um... I'm looking for a Mr.Singh, a Mr. Gian Singh. I was told he lived here. A yes, Mumsai. Miss Stillwell?! Gian. Hah. It's been sometime. It has. Please, come in. Memsai. - May I offer Memsai some tea? - Oh, yes, that would be lovely. - So this is Sirsa. - Yes. I'm on my way to Lahor, I've accepted a position with the joint Punjab legislature. - I see. - Yes. It will be a welcome change from New Delhi. The trip so far has been very pleasant. What a handsome little boy. This can't be the child though? - Memsai. - Thank you, dear. Well, to business. I'm sorry it took so long but the Ministry in charge of the unification of families is managed by a pack of idiots. Walter even got involved. Walter? How is Walter? He was a good man. Still the same. Well, where is the girl, the Muslim girl? I am the girl. I am Naseem. I have news of your family. They are very close to Lahor. I have the address here for you, as well as your travel papers. Alive? Is mommy sad? No darling. No, mommy is happy. Happy. - I love you mommy. - Oh, I love you too. Now all my prayers have been answered. Thank you Memsai. I will never forget you. You needn't call me Memsaib just Margaret. How do I get papers for Vijay and myself? That would be very difficult. You would have to contact the Pakistani government offices in New Delhi. It's not in my area, Gian. Perhaps you could go to see Mr. Sharma at the Ministry. Tell him I sent you. It was good to see you again. It was nice to see you again too. And doing so well. You have a lovely family. Tell your wife, I will be keeping rooms at the Royale Hotel in Lahor in case she has any difficulty at the border. Although her papers are all in perfect order. I checked them myself. First Class. Miss Stillwell. This belongs to you. I should not have kept it. Don't forget the Royale Hotel. - I will tell her Miss Stillwell. - Why won't you call me Margaret? Goodbye Margaret. I'll have to get my sandals fixed. - Buy new ones. - Okay. What will I do without you? - Are you taking your saffron dress? - I suppose. You look beautiful in it. I want your family to know you've been well cared for. Can I come with you mommy? No, Vijay. You have to stay here and look after Pappagee. Can I have a present? Of course. What would you like? - A horsey. - A horsey? Okay Vijay, come here. Go play. I wish you were coming with me. It's only for a short time. Here are all your tickets. For the journey there and one for your return home. One month from today. Now, don't lose it. I will write to you as soon as I arrive. Next. Welcome to Pakistan. Next. Has mommy gone so far away? No putta, she hasn't gone far. She'll be back soon. Are you looking for someone? Naseem? Akbar! Akbar, come quickly! Naseem? Naseem. - Mother and father are they inside? - Mother is inside. Where is father? He didn't survive the massacre. He was killed by the Sikhs. The day we lost you. - But today you are returned to us. - Yeah. I can only stay one month. I have a family in India. A son, and a husband. Mommy. Mommy. My baby! Gian! Vijay! I've told you before to be quiet. Why don't you listen to me? Vijay. Vijay. Where are you Vijay? Vijay? Puttr. Vijay. Vijay. - Mommy should come back now. - I know Puttr. - She promised me a present. - I know. It's okay. Liars! Both of you liers! Naseem, Akbar! This isn't right, just calm yourself. Did you know too? We did it for you. Not a single letter. Stay a little longer Naseem. Another week. Another month. Write another letter, they will understand. They killed our father. My husband killed no one. He saved my life. What are you doing? What are you doing? Answer me! You will not betray us Naseem! You want some of the candy? You do? When you joined the army, I had your father. Now I have nobody. Then you must understand how I feel mother. Well, then at least don't take Vijay with you. You're going to drag him all over the place? He's just a child. Mother, he needs his mother. Daddy see? Look what I have? Good luck in New Delhi, Gian. If there come a time to judge me Avtar, don't be too harsh. A wise man doesn't judge. In my experience there are no wisemen. I'll have known one. Bye? Be with you. Have a safe journey Gian. Find me some clothing samples in Lahore, especially in purple. Bye! Impossible. Only Muslims can enter Pakistan. Now if you wanted to bring your wife here, you can... there are still a few Hindu refugees trickling in. But my wife is Muslim. She'll have to go through the proper channels in Pakistan, to get her sponsorship papers. The present situation is still very tense. Now if you're a Muslim you could just walk across the border. Happy Delwalee Mr. Singh. From now on your name is Muhammed Hassan. This is not enough. But I was told in New Delhi nothing more was necessary. You were misinformed. We need to see a permit, proper identification. This is not enough. Please. Let us go through. It has been a difficult journey for my son. You will have to go back to New Delhi and apply for the proper papers from the high commission. Listen. You have to be quiet. Understand? Go, go. Stay down. Stay down! Go, go, go. Good day to you sir, what can I do for you? I'd like a room for my son and myself. Your name and your address please. My name... is Muhammed Hassan. - And your address? - Sirsa. - In Pakistan? - In India. Such a shame, thanks to the British, so many of us become refugees in our own home. Perhaps they had no choice. They had a choice. Naseem, try to understand. We cannot let you go back to India. I, I cannot lose you again. Don't do this to me. Mother, I am begging you. I have a husband and a son of my own now. Don't keep me here. The man is a Sikh. I thought I was the one who had a problem deciding which religion to go with? - It's been a long time. - Welcome to Lahore, Gian. Kulahafess. - Miss Stillwell. - Yes. You still have your bicycle Margaret? Gian! What have you done? Naseem hasn't returned. We've had no news. It's been almost 3 months. I'm going to Castlemoon in the morning. - Does anyone know you are coming? - No. Gian. You work tomorrow? No. The legislature doesn't sit again until next week. Could I leave Vijay with you? Gian, you can't go alone. Things are still very very bad here. Could you look after Vijay for me? This is not a wise move Margaret. Let her come out Akbar. Let her come and be with us. Please? Please. Yes? Naseem. Gian. - No. - No, Akbar. - No. - Zakir - No, ah, ah. Mommy. - Akbar, please. She is my wife. No. Gian! No. No. My sister and a Sikh! How dare you come to our home. How dare! Murderers! You killed my father. Attacked us and slaughtered us like we were nothing. - Leave him alone! - Oh, Margaret. - What's going on? - He's a Sikh. I am a Muslim. My name is Muhammed Hassan. He's a Sikh. He tried to take our sister. If it is a crime to be born a Sikh, then it is a crime to be born a Muslim. I will not listen to this. For half my life I was a soldier. I fought for India. For Sikhs, Muslim, Hindu, Christian for everyone. Don't preach to us, preach to your own people you murderer. Yes, I killed men. Many men. I came home looking for peace, I found Partition. Hate everywhere. I wanted no part of it. The day I found Naseem, I could not leave her there for someone else to harm. I had to save her. But it was Naseem who saved me. Your sister gave me back my life, she made me want to live again. She's everything to me. My sister belongs here with her own people. How can she not belong with me Akbar? I've been looking for her all my life. Are you going to release your sister to this man? Never. Let's go. Couldn't you just send him back to Lahore sergeant? This is not possible. Well perhaps we might work something out? I work for the legislature in Lahore... I imagine a man with a government job, might be happy to make a new friend. - A helpful friend. - Take him to Lahore! You look well. How's my little boy? He has Margaret in the palm of his hand. I envy you. You must love Naseem very much. The authorities will release you if you return to India with your son. Not without his mother. No. For Vijay's sake Gian. Go back to India. I am not without some influence here in Lahore. We will take this business up with the courts. And we will get your wife out of Pakistan eventually. I cannot leave without her. She's my life. If you want to keep your life, leave. This is not the way it was supposed to be. Your father and I were from the city. Our families were moderate in their views. We were not supposed to be involved in matters like this. Your father should not have died like he did. It is a little but it will help you get out of Pakistan. When he's older, tell your son that you also had a mother who loved you. Mommy. I love you so much Mommy. Don't go up the next street. Go the Allah! Allah! Allah be with you. Two please, to Amritza. Pappagee. Pappagee. There now, don't worry I'll get you another bag. Doesn't matter. Hey, wait here. - No bikes. - Please, our sister's in there. No, no, no, no, no bikes. Go back. Vijay! Mommy! Did you bring me a present? Of course. How could I possibly forget. - Here. - Thank you! Vijay. Naseem! - Please Margaret. - Yes. Naseem! Naseem! Naseem! No, Akbar! Go to Vijay! Go! Go to Vijay! Go! Akbar please! Naseem! Mommy. Naseem hurry, get on the train. Hurry, get on the train. Like so many whose lives were torn apart by the Partition, Margaret, Vijay and I came to England. Walter took Gian home to Sirsa, where he and Avtar spread his ashes around the base of the Banyan tree in the village. The banyan's roots go deep within the ground where they emerge as new trees. Like the banyan, Gian's love gave me the strength to start a new life. He lives on in all that I am, that we are.
