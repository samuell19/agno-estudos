If I didn't win, how come I'm here first? Hey, hey, hey, hey, come on, come on. We all won. We had a good time, so we're all winners, right? [Terri] Linda! Hi. Okay, I have another race. Let's see who can clean their room first, let's go. Stephen, honey don't leave your bike in the middle of the driveway, you know how angry your dad gets. Come on. Ah, great. Are you sure you don't want the little one too? No, I think this is just gonna be perfect. [Terri] What time do you need me? Is seven too early? No. This party is so important. If everything isn't just right, Robert's gonna scream bloody murder. The whole neighborhood has heard him screaming. I don't see how you take it. Oh come on, you make it sound worse than it is, really. How bad does it have to get? I'll see you at seven okay? Thanks. (mariachi music) (crowd chatters) (man laughing) At 20%, at Dallas Fort Worth area. Thank you, excuse me. (whistles) Excuse me. I know that our evening is just getting started here but it's getting late for a couple of folks and before she puts 'em to bed I want you all to meet my wonderful family. First my beautiful wife Linda, who put this whole evening together for us. (applauding) And my wonderful children, my boy Stephen, little girl Kathleen. (applauding) Say goodnight. [Both] Goodnight. [All] Goodnight. Goodnight guys. Alrighty, let's party and let's talk business. [Crowd] Okay! (chattering) (mariachi music) Okay that looks fabulous. Oh and keep 'em away from the guy with the red nose I think he ate the whole last tray. (laughing) What the hell is wrong with you? Can't you keep these kids where they belong? Honey what are you doing outta bed? I was just watching. Yeah watching, you're annoying the hell outta my guests. Stephen you go upstairs and I'll come and tuck you in in a few... The hell you will! He's too old for you to be tucking him in. It's my fault... So you stop making excuses for him, you're always doing that! Oh, you're hurting me. (slap echoes) (woman cries out) You see? See what you made me do? Bob! The guys... I'll just tell 'em you're busy. Yeah, keep 'em happy, I'll be out in a few minutes. Alright. (crying) Upstairs, right now. Oh please don't hurt Stephen. - Huh? - Don't be mean to him. Are you saying it was your fault? - Huh? - Please, please don't. Should I blame you, Linda? Huh? - Don't! - Is that what you're saying? Huh? (suspenseful music) Is that what you're saying, huh? Come on, Linda. Who's it gonna be? Who's at fault here, you, Stephen? Come on! It's my fault, it's my fault, okay! It's my fault! (cries out) That's it. Don't hurt the children, please, don't hurt the children. Okay, don't hurt the children! (whimpering) No! (slap echoes) (train whistles) Lucky you were home. I could never have done this myself. Oh it's pretty simple really. You just take the owner's manual out of the glove box, you look up the part about changing the tire and you follow directions. How come you didn't let us know you were coming? I did. Nobody answered. Maybe you didn't hear the phone. Honey. I didn't pay all that money for these super gizmos just so I wouldn't hear the phone ring. Hey you kids wanna ride with me? [Both] Yeah! Well get in the motor home! It's about Robert again, isn't it? Yeah, you don't have to say anything. (owl hooting) If you stay til Sunday, we could use you in the choir. Thanks, Mom. (mom chuckles) So you gonna stay til Sunday? I don't know, I haven't decided yet. Well, the kids are asleep and your dad's got his hearing aids out, so if you wanna talk... You remember when Stephen saw you making your cake without frosting and he called it yellow bread the first time? Honey, I remember when Harry Truman was president. (pensive music) It's about Robert. You know how we feel about Robert. I'm leaving him, Mom. I'm filing for divorce. Oh honey. (woman gasps) What? What's wrong? Oh god, bastard. That bastard! How long have you been keeping this from us? I was ashamed, Mom. How long? From the beginning. Always. I don't understand you, Linda. It's bad enough that you let him do this to you but that you couldn't come to us? I just thought I could make it better, I thought I could make it different. But I didn't, it just got worse and... And now I'm afraid. I'm really afraid. I'm afraid for me and I'm afraid for the kids. (crying) What did Robert say? (sighs) Hi, I'm home. (door slams) Linda? (suspenseful music) Where are you? Hello? Stephen, Kathleen! If this is a joke, it's not funny anymore. Where are you, where the hell is everyone? (door clatters) Linda! (dramatic music) (glass shatters) Linda! Come on Linda, open the door please, I wanna talk to you. (doorbell ringing) Linda! (door knocking) Linda, come... This isn't fair, at least talk to me! I know the kids are in there. Please let me in. (doorbell ringing) Thanks. (door knocks) Why don't you kids come with me into the kitchen, I'll fix you some nice lunch. (doorbell ringing incessantly) (Linda sighs) Okay. She may be your wife, Robert, but this is my house. And you're not welcome here. Wait, hey, hey, hey, get... (sighs) Have you gotten yourself a lawyer yet? I talked to one. Well talk doesn't feed the bulldog. Did you hire him? Well I explained to him that Robert has control of all the money and he said that in cases like that then the husband usually pays for the wife's attorney. Hmm. I didn't hear his car. Did he leave? (phone ringing) (suspenseful music) Linda. It's him. Yes. Don't do this to me, Linda. You are my wife! Now open that door. I can't talk to you when you're like this. If you think you can make a fool out of me you've got another thing coming. You won't get nothing. Absolutely nothing! Do you hear me? I don't understand, his hitting me, you didn't even bring it up. Mrs. Edelman, we haven't gone to trial yet. This is just preliminary. Why don't you just relax, let me earn my money. And let's be realistic here. Robert's paying for his attorney and he's paying my fees for representing you so... You told me that's how it was done. This is crazy. I have to move out of my house for 10 days, Robert moves in... And in five days Robert moves out, you move back in. And according to the judge I have to be out of my house in three hours? The judge himself came up with this approach. You see this way the kids sleep in their own beds, right? And where do I sleep tonight? Robert said you could use that house on Pagewood. The Pagewood house isn't even finished and I don't have the keys! Mrs. Edelman, I'm a lawyer, not a locksmith. Just talk to Robert. Well... (car door clatters) And what about Stephen and Kathleen? They expect me to come home tonight, not move out. Look, just give it a try. We'll see how this works out. Why don't you give me a call next week? Fair enough? Best I can do. [Kathleen] What time will you be back? I explained that. I'm gonna move away for five days and then I come back. No, come back tonight. Put that in the car for me, would you Terri? If you loved us you wouldn't go away. Stephen, Kathleen, come here. Now look at me, both of you. I'm not leaving you. I'm not leaving you, okay? You just don't want to be our mother anymore. Stephen honey this is just for a couple of days. Your dad'll be here, Terri'll be right next door, I'll call you tonight, Stephen! (door slams) (car engine revving) [Terri] You want me to keep her in the house? Mommy, where will you sleep? Honey I'm just gonna be at Grandma's, okay, and I'll call you later. You stay here with Terri. I'll call you later. It's your choice, Linda. You can make this easy on yourself or you can push me and see just how ugly it's gonna get. (suspenseful music) You'll get nothing. Absolutely nothing. No house, no money, no kids. You've got quite the collection here. When we spoke on the phone, you didn't have any accent, I didn't realize that you were... Asian? I was born in Ohio. As a matter of fact it wasn't until Vietnam that I learned any of the Eastern languages. So, how did you hear about me? Let's just say a satisfied customer recommended you. And? My wife has filed. We're getting a divorce and I'm afraid it's starting to get ugly. [James] Can you be more specific? I'm a businessman. I don't want my partners embarrassed by having their investments mixed up with my marital problems. So how can I help you? Follow her. I wanna know where she goes, who she sees, how does she spend her money, what does she spend it on. Simple enough. How often and where do I mail you my reports? No. I only want verbal reports and I'll pay you in cash. I don't want receipts. I don't want canceled checks. I don't want invoices, paperwork of any kind. That's not a problem, is it? As we said in the Green Berets, (suspenseful music) anything is possible. (lighter clicks) Lock and load, rock and roll. This is unbelievable. Didn't you read any of this? Yes Dad, I read it. I can't believe you're letting him get away with this. I didn't let him get away with anything. You signed an agreement giving Robert complete control over the children's lives and you say you're not letting him get away with anything? And I didn't come out here to get dumped on by my sister either. Miriam's not dumping on you, Linda. We just can't believe you'd sign this. I mean, why? I signed it because I thought it would end all the anger and frustration. Come on Linda. You signed it because you didn't have the guts to look Robert in the eye and say no. I signed it because my attorney told me to sign it. Your attorney, yeah. Well Robert's paying the bills, I don't see how you can call this jerk your attorney. Fine, fine, I give up. Well I don't want you to give up! That's what I don't want you to do! I want you to pick your shots a little better, don't you understand? I am not serving dinner until you all stop yelling. We're not yelling, Mother. [Virginia] Oh yes you are. Fine, we're all yelling, okay? Everybody's yelling and everybody's right but me. Are you happy? Then we're agreed. You get a new lawyer. Dad. The good ones won't even shake your hand or let you sit in their office for less than $25,000. I don't have $25,000, I don't even have $2,500. Look. I told you that Robert was a bum. I told you not to marry him! But you didn't listen to me! Alright. Now I can't hear you. You make the call and I'll get the money. Come on, let's eat. (pensive music) You coming? Uh, yeah. I'm sorry honey. [Linda] I hope I have everything you asked for. Did you bring those lists? Yes. Oh yeah, this is fine, fine, this is what we need. You know Robert built the houses but I did all the decorating and we both did the selling and well then the kids came. No, this is fine. I just want to show that you were part of the business from the very beginning. Mr. Vandeneichal... Also, I want you to move back in to the Carouth Street house. That's where you lived before the divorce, that's where I want you to live now. - Are you sure? - Why not? Well you don't know Robert like I do. Linda, I have made a career out of men like Robert. He's all hot air, trust me. Okay? Mr. Vandeneichal... By the way, call me Ike. At my hourly rate you'd be surprised how much money you'll save by calling me Ike instead of Mr. Vandeneichal. (laughs) Okay. [Ike] Good. Mrs. Edelman and I had a deal. We had a deal. Now this new lawyer of hers wants to start digging through my company books and embarrassing my investors. You know how it is. These days, I mean, the big money deals, they're not always done on the sunny side of the street, am I right? I understand. Before you sit down Mr. Young. Are you wearing a microphone or a tape recorder or any kind of recording device? What, are you serious? Would you take your shirt off please? Alright. It's just that we're gonna be talking about money and other sensitive issues. Turn around. Lower your trousers. Lower your trousers, please. Okay. I hope your flair for the dramatics is warranted. You've aroused my curiosity. Put your clothes on and sit down. You remember when you were a child, Mr. Young? You remember the tooth fairy? You remember you'd lose a tooth, you'd make a wish, and you'd put that tooth underneath a pillow. And in the morning when you wake up, the tooth would be gone and there would be money. Well. Wouldn't it be nice... Wouldn't it be nice if you could make a wish and put money under your pillow and in the morning when you wake up the money would be gone and your wish would have come true? I believe in wishes, Mr. Edelman. You wish hard enough, any wish will come true. (tense music) I wish my wife was dead. Well. Well. I guess now the only question to ask is how much money do I put under my pillow? Wait, wait. Be good okay, bye now. (horn honks) Hi guys, hi. I want you guys to meet somebody who's gonna be very, very special in Daddy's life and in your lives too, okay? Come on. - This is Dana. - Hi. This is Stephen, Kathleen. Your dad has told me all about you. And I want us to help make your dad happy again by showing him what a great time we can all have together. Okay? Come on, let's get in the car. Come on Stephen. (tense music) (car engine revs) (camera shutter clicking) (school bell ringing) (people chattering) (clears throat) (thunder rumbling) (rain pattering) (suspenseful music) (breathing heavily) Dad, watch, I'm gonna do an atomic cannonball! Okay, wait, Steve, wait, whoa! (water splashes) Stephen. Good. That was great. I want you to go over and have some ice cream now, okay? 'Cause Dana made it just for you. - Okay. - Alright. Pretty spunky boy you got there. Yeah, he's a good kid. Okay. You know, she's never alone except when she's at home. So, isn't that where we're planning to do it, at home? What about the parents? I don't care about her parents. If her parents are there, do them too. Just do it, alright? Okay, come here. Floor plan of the house. That's the ground floor, we've got motion detectors over here, over here, there's one over here in the stairwell. And there's another one somewhere. Oh, over here. I mean, you know, if you're gonna do it in the house it should look like a robbery, right? Are you sure you want this to happen in your own home? (sighs) Isn't that the plan, isn't that what we discussed? All I meant was... I mean I don't care, it doesn't make any difference to me. Do it wherever you want. The only thing I care about is I don't want it done in front of my kids. Sir, I know how to do the job. Well then do it! Get it done. Mr. Edelman. You think killing someone is so easy, maybe you should do it yourself. (suspenseful music) I'd love to. I'd be the first one the cops would suspect. If you don't get the ball rolling, maybe I will. (water splashes) Good dive! (claps) [Kathleen] Mama! Mama! Mama! Kathleen! Look what I found! Honey I told you not to play across the street, I want you to play where I can see you. I'm sorry but look! (cat meowing) Oh. Easy. Oh, look. Oh, oh honey. He's full of fleas! Did you see the mommy kitty? I think she wants us to keep it. Well honey you know mama kitties love their babies just as much as I love you and Stephen, and if I ever lost you... What if Daddy and Dana say that they can keep it at their house? Well, let's see. You know, it's almost time for your dance class. Why don't you let me think about it? Will you and Daddy ever live together again? No honey, we won't. Daddy's gonna live in his house and you and Stephen and I are gonna live in our house. Daddy says if he marries Dana that means that she's our new mother. Well that's just silly. Because I'm always gonna be your mommy. And Daddy's always gonna be your daddy. And divorce doesn't change that. Okay? I think maybe we better give your new kitty a bath, huh? - Okay. - Okay. (suspenseful music) (camera shutter clicking) (laughing) Well what do you think we should call her? [Kathleen] I wanna call her Millie. (mellow country music) (chattering and laughing) [Man] No time, Brad, all right. Hey. Alright, at ease gentlemen. Anyway, Fred. Look I talked to my people and I'm just sorry the job didn't come through. Wasn't there another job you were saying? That. Well. That's a mission, you know. A mission? Well, uh, in 'Nam, people that I killed in combat, I didn't count that as killing. It was a job. Just a mission, just part of my job. Well this mission you gotta think of as combat. Only for a lot more money. What are you talking about? There's this guy, it's his wife. He wants her killed. I could use the money. But not that bad. Look. Thing you gotta understand is this job is gonna go down even if my man has to do it himself. All I need from you is a name. Just somebody who could do the job. There would be a finder's fee. You wouldn't have to do anything else. You just give me a name. (cartoonish music) Somebody's trying to kill me. (horn honking) (phone ringing) Yeah? Okay. He's on his way up. (cat screeches) (door knocking) He's right here. So. You must be Zack. You know I'm glad Fred found you. I was starting to think I'd have to do this job myself. (chuckles) Fred says that you're in a hurry. I told Zack how it has to look like a robbery and all that. Fred, why don't you just leave? I mean you don't need to know any more than you already do. Just go. All right. My client is facing a court date in late July. He'd like his marriage to be terminated before then. (suspenseful music) An out of court settlement? Exactly. (cheerful carnival music) (kids chattering) And the judge granted our request, Robert has to let Kathleen dance in the recital? Even though it's on Robert's weekend. Thank you so much. (laughs) You don't have to thank me, you're paying me. And I better get going. I have to admit, this is one court order that I am going to enjoy delivering personally. You know my folks are driving all the way down here from Oklahoma, this means so much to Kathleen. And it's not just a recital, Linda. We'll get you your settlement before you know it. It's hard to believe it'll ever be over. Ah, Robert knows he's lost. He and his lawyer are starting to act like a couple of well-trained puppies. Hey you two! Hey we're gonna go home after one more time, okay? Oh! (laughs) (tense music) ("Waltz Of The Flowers") (crowd applauding) That was great, you girls were wonderful! Mommy, Mommy, did you see me? I saw you honey, you were the most beautiful princess I ever saw. I can't wait for Grandpa to take your picture. Baby, you were so good! You were wonderful, I was so proud of you. Come on, let's go home. But Daddy, it isn't over. Yes, I know sweetheart. [Linda] She wants to see the rest of the program. But we're gonna go home now. [Linda] That was the agreement. Okay don't you dare talk to me about an agreement! Court said I had to let her dance, she's danced! She belongs to me for the rest of the weekend. (crowd applauding) They're bringing Stephen. They wouldn't let me take him. Linda, this is my fiancee Dana Shoreham. Dana, this is the bitch I told you about. Come on. ("Dance Of The Sugar Plum Fairy") Hello lovely. Oh, you were so good, we're so proud of you. Oh you were so beautiful! Ooh, mwah! Okay guys, come on, let's go now. Let's go. Bye bye Mommy. (Linda sighs) Some more coffee when you get a chance. This is very important. He wants it done when he has the kids so there won't be any chance of them seeing it. You told me. You've already told me that. You know I'm really impressed with your client's big heart. Here are the dates. What do the astronauts call 'em? The windows of opportunity? Yeah, that's right. It's got to be done on one of these windows of opportunity. (suspenseful music) Now, you could even do it tomorrow. She's going to her hairdresser's tomorrow. [Zack] How do you know? [James] It's my job to know. Linda, hi! Hi. Why didn't you tell me you were coming down? We could have come together. Well I didn't know myself, they had a last-minute cancellation. Time for a root canal. (laughs) [Linda] I'm having a trim. Well how've you been? You don't call me, you don't come over. Well this last week it's just been, you know... You're my friend. I miss you. Why don't you come over later and we'll have a barbecue? Oh my folks are here and... Well bring them too! Alright I will. Okay. Thanks. - I'll see you later. - Alright. (players yelling) Five minute warning! Linda, would you get the drink orders? Sure, okay, what's everybody gonna have? [John] Diet anything! Two diet anythings! I want a root beer! Alright, that's four diet anythings and a root beer, got it. Alright, get the slaw and beans ready, here comes the meat! (laughing) Whoa, ho! Forest fire. [Woman] Here, here here. Linda, it's Ike Vandeneichal, says it's urgent. He needs to see you in his office right away. Okay. Mom, wait! Stephen, go back to Terri's. I don't want you to go! Honey, will you relax? I'm just going to Ike's. When will you be back? I won't be long, go take care of Kathleen, I'll be right back. (suspenseful music) (horn honks) (horn honking) Hey, move it! Hey, I'm trying to move! Get! (tires squealing) Come on baby. Come on baby, where'd you go? Where'd you go? (tires squealing) (breathing heavily) (elevator dings) - No wait! - Oh crap! Ike, Ike! Ike, I'm sorry, somebody's following me, all the way over here, I thought... [Ike] Linda. Mrs. Edelman. It's alright, it's alright Mrs. Edelman. We're with the Federal Bureau of Investigation, this is Agent Zachary Bell. And I'm Special Agent Joseph Masterson. Mrs. Edelman, do you know or have you ever heard of a Mr. or Colonel James Young? No, what's this about? Linda. Robert hired someone to, uh, to murder you. (tense music) (breathing heavily) Oh my god. Did you arrest him? No ma'am, no, we haven't yet. But everything is under control. Well if you haven't arrested him, nothing's under control. You don't know Robert. We haven't arrested your husband because Agent Bell here is the person who has been hired to commit this crime. Now he was hired, not by your husband, but by a middle man that your husband contracted. A Mr. James Young. The point is they already have all the evidence they need against Young. But they haven't yet got enough evidence to get a conviction against Robert. Well when will you? Well we'd like to catch Mr. Edelman in the act of making a payment to Agent Bell while the agent is posing as the hit man. [Zack] Unfortunately there's no more money due until after you're dead. And that is why we need your help. And if I don't help you I'm as good as dead. Is that what you're saying? (tense music) - I'm sorry folks. - What took so long? Where are the kids? The kids are fine. We just put them to bed. But we were getting concerned about you. Ike had to brief me about the court date coming up. Oh, lawyer without a telephone, how unusual, that's why she couldn't call us. Dad, I'm sorry, Dad, I'm sorry. Look I'm really tired, I can't talk right now, okay? I'll see you in the morning, I love you both. Hi. Hi. Millie threw up. She did? Well was it food or was it like water with grass in it? Food. Kathleen wouldn't touch it so I cleaned it up. Well, I'll take her to the vet tomorrow. You lied to me. You said you wouldn't be gone a long time! (Linda sighs) Stephen. Stephen, I'm sorry you're mad at me, okay? Dad and Dana are taking us to Europe this summer and you aren't going. Thanks. Honey. I didn't lie to you, okay? I didn't! I love you very much and I didn't lie to you. I came home as soon as I could. (sighs) (suspenseful music) He must be lost. Mom, go back in the house. Well tell them whatever they're selling, (phone ringing) you don't want it. Will you go answer the phone for me, Mom? I'll handle this. Excuse me. You must have the wrong address. No, I think this is the right place, ma'am. I didn't order you. Why don't we discuss this inside. - Excuse me. - Linda. There's a Mr. Masterson calling. He's our supervisor, ma'am. He sent us to check the house for those bugs he thinks you might have. [Virginia] You wanna talk to this Mr. Masterson or not? He needs to talk to you, Mrs. Edelman. (mumbling) and rob them blind. Never seen them before, and you leave them alone in your own home. There's nobody in this place, are you sure it's open hon? Mom and Dad, let's just sit over here, alright? Come on, let's just sit down. [John] Italian food. You know I hate Italian food, it all tastes like pizza. May we have some water please? Mother. Mother, this is Mr. Masterson from the FBI. [John] This is about Robert, isn't it? Dad, just let Mr. Masterson tell you, okay? Oh, sure, no, fine. What did Robert do? I know he didn't get my money, I'm sitting on my wallet. Mr. and Mrs. DeSilva, your daughter's life is in great danger. Yours too. Mom, Dad. Robert hired someone to murder me. My god. (tense music) - My god! - It's okay honey, it's gonna be alright. [Linda] I wanted to tell you last night, I just couldn't. Your son in law is an extremely dangerous man. It's very important that he not know we're onto him. What do you want us to do? Robert expects me to be killed when he has custody of Stephen and Kathleen. And of course they can't arrest him until he returns them. Now when the children are returned, we would like the two of you to be there so that you can receive them. And by then the payment will have been made, you'll have the children, we'll move in. So was my house bugged? Uh, no. No, it was clean. Didn't find anything. But act as if it is. This is no time to feel safe. Stay close to home and... What? It's just that remember that we have no way of knowing whether or not our agent is the only person that Robert has hired to kill you. Thursday's my 40th birthday. Most people dread it. But assuming I get to turn 40, when do I die? In four days. (breathes deeply) Where the hell you been? You know my client is very upset. - Is that right, I wanna... - What's the delay? Why don't you take this to your client and bring me back a positive ID, will you? Look the man is tired of waiting, he could go with somebody else. I told you I'm not gonna be rushed. All I'm saying is if you want the money then you gotta complete the mission. We could get cut out of this and he could decide to do this himself. Listen, I'm not gonna do anything until I'm 100% sure that I got the right person. - This is the right person! - Yeah right. Just show that to your client. What the hell you talking about? And have him put his initials on it for me, will you? [Linda] Well? 100 people went in the store and another 100 came out, I don't know if you're being followed. Miriam thinks you're acting strange. You didn't say anything, did you? I said you'd been acting strange ever since this divorce business began, and I told her not to miss your birthday party tonight. You okay Mom? Tomorrow's the day. I don't know who I'm more afraid for, you or the kids. It's gonna be okay, I promise. Don't cry, okay? (crying) (suspenseful music) (patrons chattering over each other) - Ah, great. - Thank you. Make it look like a robbery. Take her purse, jewelry, earrings, money, the whole shooting match. Is this her? What the hell, what are you talking about? You don't know? Look, you gotta be sure, I gotta be sure, that way there's no mistakes. Now is this her? [Robert] Yes, of course that's her. What's he saying? Are we getting all this? I think he's IDed the photo, he's IDed Linda's photo. I should be able to enhance this back at the lab. You should what? I should be able to enhance this back in the lab. Well how much? I can't be sure. Well that's not good enough! You know what I say Joe, I say we take this guy out right now, we got more than enough on Young to make him roll over on Edelman. And if he doesn't roll over? Well we've got Fred's testimony. What are you worried about? I'm worried about the courts kicking this guy loose, I'm worried about a woman and her two kids. Well so am I, damnit! But if we don't take this guy down soon he's gonna forget about me, he's gonna find another way to get this job done. Excuse me guys, if you're gonna fight, take it outside. I'm trying to hear what's going on. Zack. I want Edelman's slimy fingerprints on some money, I want this case airtight. ♪ And many more ♪ (laughing) (clapping) Yay! Mommy, make a wish! Yeah, make a wish! Okay, hold hands, hold hands, hold hands, here we go. Okay, here we go. Um. (blows) (cheering and clapping) Okay, okay, let's cut this cake. This is a fabulous looking cake. Who is the chef? [Stephen] I did the letters. [Kathleen] And I did the sprinkles. This looks so good. Ooh, wait, I missed your frosting, there you go. Mommy, can I have two scoops of ice cream? No honey, that's way too much sugar. What, you wanna carry your teeth around in your back pocket? (laughing) Dana gives us two scoops. Well Dana isn't your mother, is she? Don't you forget it. One. Okay, anybody else for ice cream? I just wanna thank you for a wonderful birthday. Did Grandpa and Grandma leave already? Yeah honey they had to take Aunt Miriam home and it's a long drive. Do I have to go to Daddy's tomorrow? I have a bad tummy ache. Too much cake you think? Daddy and Dana call you bad names and they make us say them too. [Stephen] Mom! Yes Stephen? [Stephen] Millie threw up again. I'll be right there, honey. I want you to remember one thing, okay? Sticks and stones can break my bones but names can never hurt me. Happy birthday, Mom. I love you so much. - I love you too. - Sleep tight. - Okay. - Okay, night. Night. (horn honking) Will you call us and tell us that Millie's okay? As soon as the vet tells me, I'll tell you. Will you call us anyway and tell us you love us? Well your dad's in a hurry. (suspenseful music) (engine revving) (tense music) (door clatters) Hello? (gasps) (shade rattling) (phone ringing) Hello? Ike. Yes, I know where it is. 7:30, okay, I'll be there. (suspenseful music) Hey. (gasps) Oh. You wanna catch a movie? I can't, I'm meeting with Ike about the property inventory. On a Friday night? Yeah. [Terri] How's the kitten? Oh my god, I forgot to pick up the kitten! Relax kid, the vet's closed. When will you be back? I don't know. I'll call you later, okay? I'm sorry, I really have to go. (police radio chatters) I want one man units. Stay with guns. Red team, you watch the house, blue team, you make sure you stay with Mrs. Edelman. And remember only point to point radio contact. We don't know who might be listening on the scanner. Did you bring the clothes you bought? - In the back. - May I have the keys? You didn't bring anything from the house? No. [Zack] Can I have your jewelry, please? And don't forget your wedding ring. You're not going to arrest Robert while he has the children? We won't make a move until he's made the payoff and the kids are with your parents. I'll need your purse too. It's my favorite. Make it all the more believable. Everything's in it, you didn't keep any personal charm or photo? No. Okay, I'm outta here. Where are you taking me? Well, Ike has been kind enough to let us use his cabin by the lake. It's very private, only one road in, it'll be perfect. You're gonna get your money's worth out of this lawyer. Linda, I'll talk to you tomorrow. You okay? I'll be okay when I see Kathleen and Stephen. (phone ringing) Yes? Yeah. Just tell your client that his divorce just became final. (sighs) Thank you. Call me back tomorrow regarding billing arrangements. Good. (dial tone rings) (people chattering) Excuse me. (suspenseful music) Yes? Mission accomplished. That's very good news. No. No, we'll talk about that later. (party guests chattering and laughing) Guys? Excuse me. Hey, psst. Excuse me. Excuse me, ladies and gentlemen. Today I'm a very lucky man. I guess you could even say that I'm blessed in business and in love. (glasses clink) And so I'd like to propose a toast. To the future. [Woman] Cheers. - And a killer year. - Hey, that's right. (applauding) What's wrong? I don't know, she isn't here. Her car is gone. Did she leave a note? She was meeting with Ike last night. I tried Ike but he's not in his office yet. Looks like she slept here last night. She wasn't here last night, I called her all night long. She didn't sleep in this bed but it's been messed up to look as if she did. Call your folks. I tried, no answer. It's gotta be Robert. We better call the police. That is what I'm trying to do, but they've had me on hold for 10 minutes. Well then let's go down there in person, come on. (birds chirping) (door creaks) You put everything you wore last night in here? Underclothes too? Every stitch. Well, I better get to Masterson. Who called this morning? My office. And? Miriam and Terri have already gone to the police. They're raising all kinds of hell. That's gonna ruin everything. If I'm officially missing then Robert doesn't have to return Kathleen and Stephen! Linda, the FBI knows what it's doing. Now Monday Robert will drop off the kids. Just stop worrying. It's the kids I'm worried about. I mean you realize that they're in the hands of a killer. You just stay inside. Keep the doors locked. I just took the whole model down to the real estate commission complete with little cars, trees, everything. So when you brought up this project, what did they say - if they're so brilliant? - They're jerks, come on, come on, they're jerks. I told them I don't care if the buildings stay empty the next five years, they own them, I don't. God they're so stupid. Can we call Mom? Stephen, that was rude. I've told you never interrupt when adults are talking. But she was supposed to call last night and tell us Millie was okay. Stephen you called just an hour ago. She wasn't there. How do you know? Maybe she's just out in the backyard. [Kathleen] Miriam said so. Wait a minute, if your mom wasn't there what's Miriam doing there? Did she say where your mom was? Let them call, for crying out loud. This is so boring. No, this is very interesting. Did Miriam say where your mother was? Answer me, Stephen! Did Miriam say where your mom was, has she spoken to her? I don't know. Okay. Come on guys. Let's go call your mom. Wash the dishes. I've done the deed, man. You shoulda seen it. Now I want my money. Well he wants to wait until the police find the body. Find the body, man, they're not gonna find nothing. Nothing, you understand me? But I did bring something for you. You think he might want some proof, show him this. Come on, show him that. Recognize those? (suspenseful music) Can't talk to him tonight. You tell him I want my money. Tuesday. Nothing before Tuesday. Yeah okay, yeah that's good, fine, Tuesday's good, I like Tuesdays, that's fine. I want my money from you guys, man. Or you know it's gonna hit the fan! I'll see you Tuesday! Well, have you seen my mom today? Okay, thanks. Bye. Terri says she hasn't seen Mom all day. What about Millie, you didn't ask about Millie! I forgot, go ask your own stupid questions. Guys, guys, guys. That's enough. I want you both to go upstairs and get ready for bed, go on now, go on. But what about Millie? (sighs) Hey. Come here. I don't want any crying. I want you to go upstairs and I want you to put your jammies on and start getting ready and then I'll come up and we'll say a prayer for Millie together, okay? Now go on, upstairs, right now. Alright your parents are already at your house. As soon as Robert drops off the kids... Why hasn't Robert paid the money? Well we think he's stalling, that he wants the police to show him a body. (Linda sighs) Okay look. Look, we can't show him a body but I can make him think there's a body. I'll go to his office, I'll talk to him. Look, you can talk to him all you want but after he drops off the kids. 'Cause Robert would love to tell the kids that I'm dead and we can't put them through that. Okay. Oh look, Grandpa and Grandma are here! Hey Stephen, tell your mother to come outside, I wanna talk to her. - Hey! - Grandpa! Stephen! How are you, buddy? Fine! Oh you're getting so big! - Hi there. - Oh Grandma! Grandma, where's Mama? How would you two like some fresh yellow bread - just out of the oven? - Yeah! Yay, okay, let's get it. (sprinklers sputtering) Oh. (engine revving) Damnit! Have like 15 minutes. The best we can determine she disappeared sometime late Friday night. Are you saying that you found blood on the seat of her car? Well we think it was blood. We can't be certain until the lab results come in. My client and his wife are in the middle of a rather acrimonious divorce. What I'm trying to decide is if you're here to inform him or to interrogate him. I'm just trying to see if there's someone who can help us find Mrs. Edelman. Why has the FBI been called in on this? It's a formality. Her car was found across a state line in Oklahoma. Well Mrs. Edelman's parents live in Oklahoma. Yes, yes, I know, and I've spoken to them, but unfortunately they haven't seen her or talked to her since sometime Friday. Well I'm sorry. Wish there was something I could do to help. Well maybe there is. A Mr. Vandeneichal gave me the name of a private investigator he had hired, by any chance have either one of you hired one? No, we haven't. Well, just that you know sometimes a private detective, well, may have seen something that would have helped us. If there's anything at all that we can do to help you, you just give me a call. Why thank you, Mr. Edelman, I appreciate that. Thank you. Thank you. (birds chirping) Hi. I really wish you'd stay inside. Is it over? We need to talk. Where are the kids? Oh the kids are fine. Fine. Robert dropped them off this morning. Masterson went to Robert's office so Robert now knows that you're officially missing. So now Robert's gonna make the payoff. Five minutes after Masterson left his office, Robert started legal action to get the children returned to him. (tense music) What does that mean? Well it just means that this whole thing is gonna take two or three more days you know. Oh no, in two or three more days my kids are gonna be back with Robert, I'm not putting them in that danger, no no. Now Linda, slow down. See we don't even know if this case will hold up in court against him. Well I'll take my chances. We need you. You've gotta give us some more time. - Tomorrow. - That's not enough time. Tomorrow or I swear to God I will walk into Dallas and I'll spit in Robert's eye, you got it? (tires squealing) (door knocking) - Good morning. - Good morning. How are the kids holding up? They're not. None of us are. Okay John I want you to take Virginia and the kids, get them in the motor home and then I want you to follow the gray sedan that's parked just down the street here. Where are we going? Just, just do it, John. Right now. (suspenseful music) [Agent] Test, testing. Okay try it now, I've got some static. Test, testing, test. Okay one more time, a little more. Testing, testing. Okay, that's good. Good. That's good. Okay now when Edelman and Young get here, try to get them to make the payoff by the car, that way we're right next to you. Okay, where are they now? Well, the blue team has Young about four miles away, Edelman left his house 30 minutes ago. Edelman better show, Joe. Well, if Young gets here first you're gonna have to stall him, you know, buy him some breakfast, anything, we wanna try and take 'em down together. Alright, you got it. The second we hear from Edelmen we move in. (suspenseful music) Somebody wanna wave to me so I know this thing's still working? [Jennifer] Hi. Thank you Jennifer. (clock ticking) (suspenseful music) Well here's half the party, I don't see Edelman, hope this guy's hungry. Zack, we don't know where Edelman is. You're gonna have to stall. Yeah that's fine but just don't leave me hanging, don't wait too long, Joe. Hey hey hey hey hey. Happy Tuesday, happy Tuesday. Come on, let's go get something to eat, I'm starving. (suspenseful music) (car door clatters) So what, so is this guy gonna show up or is he gonna stay the mystery man? [James] There's no mystery, he had a big meeting today. Oh a big meeting, yeah I bet he had a big meeting. Yeah, thing you gotta understand is you deal with me, you're dealing with him, it's the same thing. Ah. Hey partner. You act like you never dealt with a middleman before. (laughs) What, you kidding me? What, I'm the ultimate middleman, man. Just expecting to meet this client face to face. Don't worry. I got the money. (suspenseful music) Now tomorrow that stuff'll wait. That's very smart. I know a lot of guys who have sell the trim, you know sell a watch or credit cards, right, stupid. Let's go. Don't take him down, boy. Not yet. We need Edelman too. (suspenseful music) (footsteps crackling) Did you give Fred his finder's fee? I brought it with me, I thought you could give it to him. What are you doing, man? Leave the envelope alone, wait til you get to the car. Okay, okay. I'll have your second 5,000 for you in 30 days. Good. Our stuff's in here, don't look at it now, just leave the envelope in the trunk when you take the stuff. James Young you're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder. What? Now I'm gonna read you your rights and then you're gonna tell me where Robert Edelman is. (suspenseful music) (door creaks) (doorknob rattling) Joe I just couldn't stall any longer. Good job, good job. Now just got the background check on Mr. Young here. 99% of his military career is a lie. What are you talking about? He was never in Vietnam, he was never a Green Beret, he was never even in Korea. He's a big time fake. And now I'm gonna stop talking and you're gonna start talking. You're gonna tell me everything you know about Mr. Edelman, aren't you? Aren't you, Mr. Young? (suspenseful music) (doorknob rattling) (door knocking) [Man] Mrs. Edelman? Mrs. Edelman? If you're in there go to the window near the door and I'll show you some identification. Are you alright? Your children are just down the road. I'll radio them to come on through. (suspenseful music) Okay I want you two guys to cover the front, rest of you come with me. Right, get inside, cover the elevators. - Right. - Yes sir. Mommy, Mommy! Oh, oh! Hi hon, how's the fishing? Oh sis, I'm sorry, they wouldn't let me tell you. I know, I'm just so glad you're alive! (laughing) Excuse me, do you have an appointment? Please sit down miss. I'm gonna need to ask you a few questions. Robert Edelman. You're under arrest for conspiracy to commit murder. What the hell is this? Leave your hands where we can see them and do exactly as you're told. You stand up please. You have the right to remain silent. Mona! Anything you say may be used against you in a court of law. Mona, get Ken Fuller! You have the right to a lawyer and to have him present (handcuffs click) while any questioning takes place. (dramatic music) (police radio chatters) Stay back please. Stupid jerks. I didn't kill my wife! No, you didn't. She's still alive. But you did conspire to have her killed. Conspiracy to murder is a crime. The only thing we don't know, Mr. Edelman, is how many years you're going away for. - Get in the car. - No, but... Watch your head. Watch your head. - Let's go kids. - Let's roll. (siren wailing) (laughing and chattering) You want some more ice cream? - Hi mommy! - I'm Mr. Ed! Here you go kids, they're thirsty. And there's the birthday boy. Look Mom! Hi honey, are you having a good time? Happy birthday. Where's your sister, Kathleen? Oh over here Mama! Hi sweetie. Oh we're having a great time. [Linda] Dad, Mom. Hey, look at this. (laughing) [Linda] Very good, so smooth. Linda, look who's here! Oh. Hi, you're on video, say hello. (laughs) See if you can get a picture of the whole table, will you? Okay, okay gang. So, how are you doing? You tell me. Is it over? As of 10 o'clock this morning. Robert's conviction on the federal charges was upheld. And he's accepted the plea bargain. (sighs) He's given up all rights to the children? It's over. Your life can go back to where it was before. Oh no, I don't want that. (uplifting music) That's behind us. Why don't I get you some cake? Thanks. You know Robert's not gonna be in jail forever. Well, there are two things I can't worry about. One is yesterday and the other is forever. Here you go. Thanks. No, thank you. For everything. Well actually thanks to Fred Zabitosky. Because if he hadn't called us... Mommy, Millie threw up again. (laughs) Millie threw up again, what a surprise! - That's our cat. - Hmm. Well, hi, Stephen. Why thank you buddy. Happy birthday. Thank you. Oh very nice. (laughing) - Happy birthday. - Thank you. (dramatic music) (upbeat music)
