Under the influence of the Tokugawa Shogunate's Sakoku policy Began the blossoming of a unique Japanese town culture in a long-lasting period of peace and prosperity Among the many books were gorgeous ukiyo-e paintings That enjoyed great popularity among the commoners However, in the midst of the free tide of the townspeople's culture The Tokugawa Shogunate's prestige was shaken and the Shogunate called entertainment the source of the country's degradation. The publishers and artists were deprived of their creative freedom and were severely suppressed. Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Get out of the way. Get out of the way. Get out of the way Get out of the way! Get out of the way! Please stop Don't interfere Grandpa! Grandpa! Let go, Master Please stop. Please stop. Master of Koshu-do Shigesaburo Tsutaya Repeatedly disobeying advice Breaking the ban Indiscriminate opening and printing of books Blatant painting of folklore It's outrageous -Do it! -Yes! Let's go! Moving in. Chapter One. Even when it's dirty like this The charm is still intact As expected of a kamaro Yes Thanks to them The tree is a great attraction In other words The above has been confirmed We're one of the top publishers in Edo Edo's number one painter and playwright I trained them all It's so much fun This is timely rain Now all of Edo will be watching our work As they say, if you don't break it, you don't stand it. -Grandpa Tsutak Heavy is here. - Okay. Welcome Welcome Welcome Grandpa Tsutomu is here! Big Brother -You look busy. - Not bad. You're finally getting good at trading, aren't you, Genjiro? I can see your father's style already. You flatter me. I'm not even close to my father. I'm already dizzy from dealing with disputes between clients at the moment. After all, it's an orgy here every night It's only the beginning of the show, isn't it? Thank you for your patronage Looking forward to your next visit I'll be here tomorrow too These country bumpkins Both samurai and merchants were men Here, there's no restraint It's said that there's a flower girl called Asuki at the Kameya I heard that she had very beautiful eyes Now that you've spoken I'll bring her to you even if she's in Kyoto. I'm not going Why It's not a bad thing I hate painters Tell me about it Because those guys don't know how to be polite There was a guy who made me stand up all night a while ago He seems to be a very enthusiastic guy Are you kidding? Simply a mountain monkey with no manners I don't know if I can draw it anymore The last one looks like it's going to pounce before it's finished Then he must have painted a good picture Of course, it's me after all. But I don't want to... Standing in front of the mountain monkeys again That must be right. It's Haruhiro. Haruhiro Katsukawa. Katsukawa? Yes, I've done a few of them for us too. The mountain monkeys are absolutely right. Huh? Found it. Found it. Here Not a bad picture It's just that... Never paint what you don't want to paint If you want to paint, paint until you're happy He's a pain in the arse. But I don't know what happened to him now Is he no longer in the Katsukawa family? He was expelled from the school long ago. Expelled? He's a man who doesn't give a damn when it comes to painting He's in Katsukawa and he still paints Yamato (Yamato-painting: national painting from Japan, with Japanese subjects and techniques different from those of Tang painting) Even the Kano school was involved (The Kano school: the largest school in the history of Japanese painting, a group of professional painters whose main focus was on blood relations such as relatives and brothers) At the end, he beat up his brother Beat him up? Why? Not sure You are from the Kooshu Hall I'd like to come and see your paintings I waited for a long time and didn't see you come back, so I came in without permission. What do you want? Come and see if you're still alive My family told me this Do you have any food left? No need for your concern I occasionally sell paintings for a living Selling paintings? Can it be realised? Yes You Do you want to come and paint with me? I'll start from scratch and train you up. What's wrong? I refuse I'm sorry, I'm not the kind of person who does what I'm told. So that's how it is I heard you beat up your brother, didn't you? Did that bastard Zongyi tell you that too? That's right. Why did you beat him up? Because he altered my painting without permission A waste of a good painting That's it I'm sorry Long time no see Are you here to see Grandpa? He's in Yoshiwara. This way, please. This way, please. This way. Go this way Eh, eh, eh, eh Here comes an interesting person You know someone? A painter I found by chance Just a Mountain Monkey This is the legendary Haruhiro Katsukawa Although he's been expelled from the school Don't just stand there Sit down Mr. Komaro is drawing the most beautiful flower girl in Yoshiwara. I don't mind But it's a rare occasion Would you like some too? I don't drink. That's good. With this guy, you can make a lot of money even if you don't pay for the drinks. All right, sit down. This fish is good. You should try it too. I can't eat something so extravagant Did you hear that? Is this guy really a painter? It seems so. Simply the same as a monk So you can't paint a woman's face Your painting of a woman has no charm Right, Tsutaya? Not that you're bad at drawing It's just that... Let's put it this way You're just taking what's in front of you and putting it on paper as it is. A shell without a soul To escape? I have more than just you to choose from Painter or something As much as you want Excuse me, can you close the door? Then Would you please, Miss Asawa... Sit down with your back to me. How was last night Did you always draw there? Hmm? Ah, yes. I ate, slept, drew and painted all in that room All paid for by us That's a lot of money. You don't have to pay him, do you? The old man let him live there. so that he could draw... so that he could hang out with women. Thanks to him, the shop is almost overwhelmed Nowadays, almost all the money in the shop is made by Mrs. Yoshihara. What a headache! I can't even see it here What about you? What about you? Do you want to draw? Uh... That's right. This Help me return it to your grandfather He put it in my house, but I can't take it. Take it. I told you I wouldn't take it. Then paint Don't you have confidence in yourself? What a stupid thing to say! No painting? What do you mean by that? What do you mean? Take a good look Is the painting better than Kamaro's? Did you draw it because you were in a state of triumph? What did you paint for? What are you talking about? Literally Why do you paint? How would I know such a thing? I'm not a child of a big family So why did you become a painter? Because I felt that painting could bring people out of the bottom Painting is not about status If you can paint well, you can get ahead Then don't paint Don't draw it Don't waste your time with this shit. What did you say? What the hell? Bastard Big Brother Big Brother I'm sorry Big Brother I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Big Brother Here, look at this. -Who painted this? - Actually, it's our guest. This guy's young, but he's good at it. He painted the essence of pleasure Enjoyment? He's drawing a Kabuki actor He drew theatrical scenes in a bantering way Isn't it exaggerated and funny? Can I see him? Sure. Can you sell it? There's more to it than that. Okay, we'll buy it. Buy it all. Brother Okay, and this one, too. Not enough Not enough? It's not that kind A painting that makes your eyes light up when you look at it -with mica -what Printing with Mica That's not going to work. It's not profitable.

He's the one who found Raku That's true, but without you I can't polish a diamond into a piece of art Oh dear, it's all here Mr. Kuma Very gifted I said your painting Seeing these paintings I was surprised too Gentlemen, it's time for the highlight of the show. Here comes the queen of flowers The Flower King Asawa Congratulations! Hey, I want to ask you a question, okay? In your opinion, is that what Kabuki looks like? Does that look like If you can, I'd like to show you these eyes The resemblance is not enough Is it interesting if you exaggerate? No, it's not. I was trying to draw The Inner Heart of Kabuki Do you understand? Who do you think I am, boy? If you don't like it, forget it I said I don't drink I know Just trying to get you to lift your head up Really Disgusting Those are called paintings too Is that what you want? Don't be ridiculous. That kind of person doesn't deserve to be called a painter The face and hands are deformed The face alone All of them are ugly and pretentious Mr. Writer is not a painter like you He's not under anyone's tutelage And there is no master Then why does he paint? I just Just enjoying painting I didn't know I was going to pick up a pen and start drawing with great enthusiasm You're bragging What's so enjoyable about painting? Calmness I just Painting from the heart Is there anything you don't like? All right, all right. Hello? Are you at home? It's so cold and you're sitting outside The doctor is here I've been calling you for a long time Old man Yo Nice expressions. I'm getting tired of waiting I've got Edo's disease and my days are numbered (Note: A disease prevalent among the upper class in Japan during the Edo period, caused by a chronic deficiency of vitamin B1) I just drew what I wanted to draw. If you don't need it, just say so. The wave That's interesting. I didn't expect you to draw this Stunning Waves I've never seen waves like this before But I know That's what you call a wave Nice painting Can you paint one for us in the shop? (A Spring Landscape on River Island, 1797, by which time Hokusai had changed his name to SÅri, and the classic Hokusai-style scenes already appear in this painting) You At last, the cocoon is broken You're the only one who can do this kind of painting The same sound as this Mount Fuji, but written with the unique "Buji" That's why it's beautiful Hokusai Interesting name too The name is based on the North Star It is the only star that never moves Open it and see Edo Only this one Smaller than a grain of rice Isn't it funny Me Every time I see this I'm so happy to see it Forgetting all the superfluous things The mind travels here and there, leaving nothing behind What's at the end of the sea There's Wine There's food and there's women Of course there must be paintings All the things that have never been seen before Me To open a shop there In a country I've never met Trading in the business of selling the paintings of the artists I like I want to prove it to them My eyes have not missed it Looking at the Painting Nothing to do with words or language Interesting stuff Interesting to anyone who reads it Isn't it? The Northern Vegetarian Painting It's the one that changes the world We can't go on like this here Wait, I'll get the wine. Looks like we're going to have a good drink today. Chapter Two. Master? Where are you going? Be careful on the road Have you finished the last one? Shouldn't you have something to say to me before then? I've finished it. Here It's a bit slow this time Because I'm not just drawing for you guys here You're not looking too good. How about a little rest? How dare you say that about other people? All you do is hug a table Hello How's Zeng? Didn't I tell you before? I'll be good too... Oh, oh, wait, wait, wait. Huh? -Do you want to draw it here? - I can see the picture. It's going to disappear if you don't get it down. -You can't either. - Don't say anything yet! Whatever you want. Are you awake? Hmm It'll be ready right away. Not this one Sorry, you should redraw it. The painting covers up the story What does it mean? It means that the painting is too impressive Something I didn't write You drew it on your own initiative I can't help it. That's the way I see it. You said you saw it. Where did you see it? here This is seen inside The story you wrote surfaced here That can't be If you have drawn your own picture It doesn't fit the logic of the story The reader's imagination is opened up by the illustrations I want to draw what I like Are you saying you won't redraw it? Ah! I want you to understand What the Guest Wants to Read It's a story I wrote All you ever bring me are boring stories that stick to the rules. The story doesn't move forward, I can't get a picture out of my head This one is different Quick, Master OK, OK The author's name is Yanagijeong Seiko Writing about monsters This book is so funny that you'll forget the time Did you say something? No Just watching you read it with fascination Yes. I've made tea. Please take a break. hmm Yanagitei Kikuhiko In the Mind of Vladimir The face and figure of the cat lady always lingers Painful Gradually Sickened Physically and mentally exhausted soon to die And all the people said This must be the result of a cat's resentment So when it comes to this People were trembling with fear Meow -Grandpa! -What's wrong? Mr. Kemaro was arrested What Happened saying that he had painted against the ban Why all of a sudden? Isn't there always a painting like that? Speaking of which If the command from above is obeyed Can you still draw anything good? Of course it's just a way to kill the monkey It's called shooting the head off a bird It's called a big tree that attracts a lot of attention Tsutaya's boss also said What about Kimaro? said to have been imprisoned To be detained for 50 days 50 days? I'm very sorry I have to leave the meeting We're probably going to be involved too Grandpa, Grandpa One Step Ahead Is it so bad to draw a picture that someone else likes? 01:06:03,040 Certainly not a good thing for the court Just shut up and work for the sake of the court Don't be angry, don't laugh, don't be happy Sadness makes you wise, so don't even cry Hello! Where are you going? Not going anywhere Home Still have unfinished work to do You... You're still in the mood to paint on a day like this? That's why I have to paint I am pregnant Baby Aren't you glad? Sorry I was just thinking A child born in this world today Can You Really Be Happy? Can you smile for me?

I've been writing all night and into the morning I want the teacher to read it quickly That's a lot of work How has the teacher been since then? Who knows? After my mother died The stubborn old man is even more stubborn Like a stone Buddha of the Earth Painting from morning to night So You'll be able to relieve my father's boredom too Talk to him slowly Good morning, Mr. Hokusai. Good Morning -The weather has cooled off completely. - Yeah. This is for you She'll be happy Good morning Good morning Teacher, I'm going to open the window This is an unpleasant mess nowadays To the Root or because of the chaotic atmosphere in the marketplace The vulgar readings and ukiyo-e that were spread around the city Among others, such as the combined volumes A book that even women and children can read It's a very bad book We, as samurai, must maintain our modesty For these things that disturb society Strict remedial action must be taken You're not a free agent either Born in the House of Samurai Dissatisfied with samurai status again Let the guy who wants to say it say it What can you do if you're angry with them? And then again It's a world where things stay the same Paintings can change the world Before There's a Man Said so What a quote -Let's get started, Mr. Hokusai. - Okay. Teacher You are back -You're back - You're back Where have you been wandering again? West Village House has gone back They even brought the printed pictures Father Lord Father -Teacher -Teacher Water Water Someone get the water! Master, can you hear me? Stroke Life is saved though But the most important hand keeps going numb I may never be able to hold a pen again Although everyone says we're lucky to be alive But how could I say that to my father? Where is the teacher? Asleep If only mum was still around We'll leave you to it then Farewell Father, it's time to take your medicine. I'll help you up I'll help you Can you hold it?

Is that weird? The age thing is not a lie Seventy years old is seventy years old And being scolded by Ah Wing I'm going away for a while With your current body? Yes. It's not bad to die in a strange land Master kidding I'm not going to die Thank you very much There must be some... only in this state something that can only be seen I still have to be with the world I'll take a chance It would be futile to try to stop you anyway Yes, it's useless. I'm not giving it to you Stop talking nonsense and get back to work Where are you staying tonight? This kind of stuff. Just look for it when you get to the place What to do if you can't find it Then we'll have to deal with it in the neighbourhood I knew you'd do that. samsung zitansha genji Book of Genghis Khan Young and popular It was so popular that the book couldn't even be printed Very good Narihiko is a Samurai Not like us Just writing a book Dividing What Samurai Civilians Just because he was a samurai If he's targeted, it's over So, you're going to stop Karihiko. Do you think you can stop it? Do you think I would stop painting for fear of punishment? Akihiko and you are different A Man Who Wants to Write a Book Just Born in the House of the Samurai Aren't You Worried About Jiyan? He just poured everything he wanted to write into his pen and it just touches the heart What could be more fortunate than that It's unstoppable Isn't that what happened to you too? Thank you for your patronage Please come in Welcome I was here first I was here first Chapter Four. Long Seven Take this to Sister Wing Yes Master Takayakushita Did you know that Yanagitei is the seed of the Yanagitei family? Do you know this person? I don't know When this is the case The man is a miscreant who writes badly How could I have met someone like you? Think about your position It's not a good thing for the Musha family to be involved with people like that There is no such person as Yanagitei Jiyan There never was, and there never will be Do you remember? Under the High House Yes What's up? Okay, okay. -Have some more. - Great. -Thank you. Thank you. - Come on, come on, let's drink.

Yes, yes, yes At Asama Negi Koshima It's a bit cool today Do you want to give up? I'm confused Master... Would you give up everything for painting? Can you give up Wing and the disciples and become nothing? Sorry for asking such a meaningless question Someday Someday We don't have to live under the world's thumb I wish I could live and see this world with my own eyes I hope so too I... I can only do what I can do Ayanami What is this? I asked you what this is Expulsion of Yanagitei Seiko from his house What do you mean? Expulsion of dabblers from the host's house Consider it a shameless person who you happened to rescue and didn't leave for writing frivolous pieces that mock the Shogun's administration The master did not want to continue to be involved with him and drove him out of his house So that's it, everything's settled, see? Just a moment Can't do it -I can't do it. -Hikoshiro Takaya What do you take the honor of a samurai for? You know what will happen to the Takaya family and yet you can say this Do You Want to Destroy the Takaya Family? Does it matter if your wife and children are on the street? It's not too late to repent Throw it all away Give up the needless insistence, give up the cheapness of mind That's all I can say Please wait I... Won't give up I won't give up writing I'm just... Yanagitei Kikohiko I can't lose him Lord Father He is, my lord... Self-destructive He was worthy of the name of a warrior A decent death Lady Sheng Araihiko Father A Day Like This... Do you still want to paint? That's why I want to paint Father, this painting... If such a painting had been seen by the people above... You'll get caught too Ah Wing I know what kind of a person Kanehiko is He won't kill himself Someone sealed the mouth He didn't even finish what he wanted to say before he was silenced Father Leave Edo, please! Just listen to me for once, please! Father Teacher: Hokusai Sensei Still the same I'm going to be 90 years old But I see the same thing after all It Will Change One Day I'll keep this painting for you until the day comes I'm sorry Hung Shan Yes I have a favour to ask you now What I want to paint Some words came to my eyes Words? Yes Some words I want to put down these words To remain in this world.
