[recording] Oh, beautiful for spacious skies, For amber waves of grain, For purple mountain majesties Above the fruited plain! America! America! God shed his grace on thee, And crown thy good with brotherhood From sea to shining sea. There! There! Over there! Get that one! There we go. All right, we're on. We're on. My name is Bruce Mertz and the people around here call me Mr. Christmas. This is my 31st year of putting up the lights. I've been living here since 1977 and, uh... every year I start setting up at the end of August. Takes me about 3 months. Oh, I just go from one thing to another thing 'cause I know if I just do one thing a day, I'm going to get it done. Most of the commercial lights fade out over time, so I've developed my own paint that does not fade. The lights that I've used it on have lasted something like 12, 13 years without ever fading. I gotta heat up the insulation so it's pliable. Right now it's kind of stiff. I started with a string of lights around the house. My neighbor across the street told me that... when I moved in here, "You gotta add something new every year," you know? "That's what we do around here." So over the years, I've added something every year... And he hasn't added anything. He's still got same string of little C9 bulbs from 40 years ago, and... while he sits in the house and looks through his picture window at this beautiful light display across the street. So he knows how to work things. [chuckles] [cat meows] You want me to brush you down? Aw, heck. - You wanna see this girl do a trick? - [cameraman] Sure. I'll show you a trick. Maybe she won't do it anymore, but let me see. [cat complains] Okay? There we are. - [cameraman] Is that...? - That's her trick. Right, Trixie? Oh. [ratchet squeaking] Well, I first met Bruce at the, uh... AJ's Bar & Grill. I used to play liar's dice down there and the guy liked to play liar's dice, so I met him whilst playing liar's dice. Sitting next to Mr. Christmas is a good spot. I get lotsa hugs. [music] How 'bout that, buddy? The first night I turn 'em on is on Thanksgiving night. That's a happy holiday. Christmas is a happy holiday. New Year's Eve is a happy holiday. So I go on to the 2nd of January. Here we go. When I start the lights at night, I have a CD with the National Anthem I mean, "God Bless America." So at, uh, two minutes and ten seconds before six o'clock I put on the music [music begins] and then as the applause dies down, I got all my timers... I got 14 timers, all supposed to come on at the same time and then I go in and I have a CD with all banjos playing Christmas tunes. and that's the start of the evening. [applause, kids cheering] - Merry Christmas! - Mr. Christmas! [banjo music] So I go out about every 15, 20 minutes. Greet them for the evening. I'll hand out photographs to 'em. Every season now for the last 4 or 5 years, I've gone through about 4,000 photos. They usually ask about three questions that I've put the answers to on a little label and put it on the back of the photograph. [happy crowd noises] - Uh-ho-ho! - Can I see? Can I see? - I wanna see! - Haahhh! - Oh my gosh! - Can I see? - Coool! [kids] Merry Christmas! Bye! [banjo music continues] Actually, I told you I had a lot of fun watching the people on the red carpet. - Especially the kids. - Yeah. - They're either chasing the lights back and forth on the red carpet or else they're rolling down the hill. It is... [laughs] ... hilarious. "Can I come inside?" I says, "There's nothing inside! "I mean, there's nothing. It's just, you know, my cat! "That's all there is, is my cat." - Hi, Trixie. [cat complains] [banjos: "Up on the Housetop"] Ha, ha, ha! [cameraman laughs] [Randy] He's no Fred Astaire. - All right. Well, we'll see you tomorrow. - Okay. - Thank you! - Bye. [Randy] What was that, Bruce? You didn't say that, did you? [cameraman laughing] - I didn't say that. Did I say that? [all laughing] [TV reporter] His neighbors call him Mr. Christmas and every night at 6 pm sharp he flips a switch... - Mr. Christmas. [Randy, on TV] His mind is so active, it is impossible for him to stop working. [Bruce, on TV] People ask me, where do you buy all this stuff? I say, you can't buy it. I say, I built it all myself. [singing] I wish you a Merry Christmas, I wish you a Merry Christmas I wish you a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year. [banjos: "Deck the Halls"] [electrical buzzing, clicking] [piano] This is a sequencer I bought for $2 in 1978. These relays here are mounted on two fry pans that I bought from K-Mart. And I'm using them for a heat sink. There's 20 microswitches on here. Each one of these little plastic plugs intercepts a switch. I've got it programmed so that the lights chase around the house in blocks of eight. [saxophone and drums] I never got into lights until I moved here. I grew up out in South Dakota. I was the youngest of 10. We didn't have electricity then on the farm, and I'd never seen any electric lights or anything like that. We were not necessarily that rich, you know, and so presents were kind of few and far between there, during Christmas. I have a joke about South Dakota. South Dakota's the Ever-Never Land. If you ever leave, you never come back. I left to join the Air Force. The first time I ever rode on a train, the first time I ever rode on a bus. I went to Fort Warren, Wyoming for electrician's school. That was my first experience with lights, colored lights. If someone come along and took their hand like that and dragged all the wires out of the way, I wouldn't know what to do because I have no circuit design here. It was all done in my head. There's add-ons and jury-rigged, lot of hours if I keep my hands off it and everything's okay. [music] [music fades] [cat meows, purrs] Nellie was very interested in Christmas. She loved Christmas. She used to go to church and tell Christmas stories. She was so good at it, she'd have the kids in tears, you know... [laughs] ...the way she described everything, you know. But then we, uh... Uh, we lacked one week of being married ten years. It was a childhood cancer that she had acquired, but it was for an adult. She, uh, well she died about 18 months after she had got it, got the disease. And then, uh, I continued to go to work. And I retired from the... retired from the civil service in '94. I realized I had a life to live and I, uh... What am I going to do? And I says, well, best thing I can do is just, uh, do lights. You know, just keep on doing lights, you know? That way it kept me busy but also allowed me to be able to entertain people and have them become happy with it, you know. Which in turn made me happy. We had a very up and down emotional day last... last Monday. I was sitting in the garage here and my friend Randy was sitting right over here next to me And I'm looking out the door across the street and I could see the... the garbage truck coming around the corner - a big garbage truck it was going about 45 miles an hour - way fast. The speed limit's 25. This big flash of brown went up in the air like that and... and killed a cat. I said, Randy - go see if that's Trixie. I can't face it, you know. [Randy] And I came back to the garage and I said to Bruce... "I'm sorry." So I went over there and picked up Trixie and I brought her back and put her in the back yard. We took turns digging a hole. Cut a sheet and put Trixie in it. We both had tears in our eyes doing this. So we lowered it in the hole and... put the sheet over the top of it. So I went back out here in the garage and sat down tears still streaming down my face. Randy was in here, he was... tears streaming down, too. And all sudden, I look over and Trixie walks in! He says, well look - look, there's Trixie! I looked around, I said, oh, my god, there's Trixie! I thought I was seeing a ghost! And he's, oh, wow! He just hollered out loud and... when all that noise came, well she just took off, right? We couldn't find her again. I thought, well, that was unbelievable. I don't believe that happened. And Randy said, "I'll go look for her." I said, "That's just an apparition. You didn't see it." So then he finally found her, and come back out here. And then, I got to thinking, oh, my neighbor's cat looks just like Trixie. But when I went out to pick up Trixie, I didn't have any thought that it would be somebody else's cat. And I says, "Frank," I says, "Why don't you sit down here." And I told him, I says, "You know - "I think that your cat is buried out on the back yard here." He says, "I don't know how I'm going to tell my wife." I says, "Well, good luck." I says, "I'm sorry. "But I'll tell you one thing - "You won't have to do too much grieving 'cause we did all the grieving for you." [music] - [Randy] Bye, Santa! - [Bruce] Bye! See you next year. Hope you don't wear out your arm, waving at people. There he goes, there he goes. [Randy] Don't do it! Stay on! [Bruce] So, we gotta go in and turn the rest of this stuff off. [Randy] Well, leave 'em on for a little bit. - What? - Leave it on. - Okay. If you like. Hi, Trixie [meows] Yeah, how are you? After the lights go off and it's rather dismal... ... you know, I mean... ...golly sakes, where did all the fun go? You know what I mean? And once I back to the idea that I gotta take this stuff down well, then it's just a normal part of the cycle of Christmas... New Year's... Easter... July... summer...
