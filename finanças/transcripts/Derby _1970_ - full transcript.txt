(intense dramatic music) (sirens) (synthesizer tones) (crowds cheering) (grunts) (players shouting) - Ah, shit. - Go, man, go! (grunts) - Oh there he goes! - Oh, shit! (referee whistle) - I'll be a son of a bitch! - C'mon, Lenny, c'mon, let's go! - [Fan] Son of a bitch! (crowds gasping) (crowds roaring) (grunts) - [Player] You take that saggy hunk of meat wherever you want, as long as it isn't in the goddamn way! - Watch it! (crowds roaring) And what's your problem? (grunts) Work it out, work it out! We're gonna have to work at this. Yeah, work it! Work it, work it! Work it! - Barb, you blew it! Barbara, find out, c'mon! - [Barb] It's so awful living here. Over where? - Over here. Helen, I want you over here at this table. Is everybody listening? Every time the gals were going in and out the pack is spread all over the place. They dump two or three people going around that way. Lydia and I, once we get our rest, we can go around stuff. - Yeah, you know, when I feel good, I fought around an attack by myself. - And in changeover, the pack is together, there's only five seconds to go, and everyone stops. Those that are out there, get right into that changeover and everyone knows that Lydia and I are at changeover. (everyone speaking at once) What do the Chinese call 69? - Two-man-chew! - Yeah. (everyone laughing hysterically) - Hey, I never did finish about why the guy went to the grocery store, and he asked for some toilet paper, no, I screwed that up! (laughing) No, he asked for some dog food, that's right! And he says, "Do you have a dog?" And he says, "Yes." He says, "Well where is it?" He says, "At home." He says, "Well, I'm sorry kid, there's no dog food "unless you have your dog here." So two weeks later, he comes back and he asks for some cat food. And he asks him, "Where's your cat?" He says, "At home." He says, "I'm sorry, kid, I can sell you no cat food "if you don't have your cat with you." So man, two weeks later, this dude comes storming in the store, had a paper back, and he slammed it on the table, and he told the dude to stick his hand in there. And the dude-- (everyone laughing) Dude sticks his hand in there, and he comes up, and it's shit, all full of shit, and he says, "May I have two rolls of toilet paper?" (everyone laughing) You didn't catch it? - Yeah! - You didn't see the red in my hair. - The what? - I put it all over my hair, it's red, right here. - I don't see it. - Huh? - I didn't know he was a red Mexican! (laughter) (knocking on door) - How you doin'? - Okay. - I've been watching for a couple of years. If I, if I can get into it, I was, is there anyone of you boys here can do a handspring on skates? Alex, you led me on this idea here. A few weeks ago I saw you throw Tony Roman, you and another guy, over a double block. You remember when you done that? - Mmhmm. - Well I, for a long time I've been able to do a handspring, and I was thinking one of you boys should do a handspring, that'd be a good play over a double block. - Well, we're not too interested in handsprings or anything, we're mainly interested in skating. - [Mike] I know, but, it just led the idea, I was-- - Have you done any skating before? Other than-- - Yeah, well-- - Roller rink? - Not when I was older. The bank track, I snuck on the bank track one time, I skated on it for a could hours, but that's all. I was in Huber Heights Beach, skating for about a year and a half, but never much on a bank track. - Well, it's a little different right now, this kinda skating. - Yeah. - We're gonna try and get a school back here pretty soon. I don't know if it's gonna be here this year or not. You going out to the coast at all? - Yeah, I'm gonna give them a call tomorrow, I got the address in the Herald and I'm gonna call them tomorrow and see what they say. And depends what they say, if they sound like I can get somewhere, I'm gonna give my week's notice in my job. - Well, that's it, because before we can touch you, you're gonna have to go through the training school. - Right. - And then from there, everybody gets a shot, if they need you, they'll take you. So I can't tell you that I would get you or anybody else, anybody can get you. - Ah I see how it works. - So the best thing to do is find out what you can do, and how much money you've got saved to go. Because you don't know I you're gonna make it right away. - I realize that. - So-- - [Mike] I've been wanting to for a long time, and things just gotten away at the time. - You guys, let's start going out now. (skates clattering) Alright, well that'd be the simplest, just get in touch with Buddy. His name is Buddy Atkinson. - Buddy, yeah, I've got it on the address that Harold gave me. - Yeah, I know. THat'll be the best place to go through, and you never know, we picked up a couple of guys and they've trained, in about four or five weeks they've made it. But, you know, Bill was the same type, you know. He came up to us-- - Yeah, I know him! - Found out about getting in. - Yeah, oh was he? - Yeah, he came up to me, I guess maybe seven years ago now. So it took him, I think he trained for only six months. He wasn't very good when he started. He had no experience. But it didn't take him very long before he made coach's job. So, and he started when he was, I believe, 27 years old. - I'm 23 now, I got trophies at home for speed skating and figure skating. - That's what you need, we're mainly interested in speed. Not the figure skating. - Yeah, no, I just happened, at the time, to get in. - [Charlie] Well, any experience you got at all is good. It's in your favor. - Okay. - Okay? - Thank you very much. - Fine. - Appreciate it. (crowd cheering outside) (jeering shouts from crowd) - I went back there, and he told me that Bill Rose came to him the same way I did. He told me I have to get in touch with the training school in Oakland first, and then I'll come back. (crowd shouting and cheering loudly) He said for me, if I go out there, he said, Rose spent six months in there, but he didn't know how to skate at all when he was signed. Went out there for the Pioneers. He was one nice guy though. Actually talked with me, he was a really good guy, he said I have a lot of potential. - Did you tell him you could skate? - Yeah. - What'd he say about that? - He said it was good, everything I could do was in my favor. So I'm going out, gonna give him a call tomorrow. - Where do you have to call? - Oakland. Somewhere, I have the address here. I've gotta get in contact with Bay Bomber Training School, it's in Oakland, no, it's in Alameda or something, California. - Did he say about how long it would take? Schooling for you? - Six weeks. - Six weeks? - So I guess we can handle it for that long. I hope. (laughs) - Well, if you really want to do it! - Yeah, I do. Okay? - Yeah. (crowd cheering) (players shouting and grunting) (fans cheering loudly) Get him, Johnny, get him! Get 'im! - C'mon Johnny, get up! C'mon Johnny, let's go! (grunt) (crowd cheering) - [Player] Hey listen! Listen here, you saw me out there, you saw him tripping me! He tripped me right over there! There's some tripping, I know you saw it! - You're a goddamn bum out there! - Don't give me that crap! You saw him tripping! - You scored two points! - Yeah? - Yeah, two. Oh, shoot, two, you didn't see nothin'! Oh, shut your mouth, you too! (crowd booing) (grunt) (ref whistle) (crowd cheering) - [Fan] C'mon, Jack, let's go, c'mon! (players shouting) - Mama... (thump) (Shawn crying) Back... - You hurt your back? (boy whimpering) Think you're gonna live? Hey, kiddo. Get up! Want some breakfast? (Shawn babbling) Get off the table! Get down off the table. (Shawn shouting nonsense) Butch, what did you do with the raisins I was gonna make spaghetti with. - I don't have 'em. - Did you hide 'em? - I didn't hide them raisins! - [Christina] Well, I know you didn't want me to use them for the spaghetti, so did you hide them from me? - Did you buy another box? - Yes, I bought another box. What'd you do with them? - [Butch] Nah, that'd be too many raisins in there. - No, I've already made it, but I'd still like to know what you did with my raisins. You caused me an extra trip all the way to the store just to buy a box of raisins. - You don't need 'em now, so don't worry about it. (humming) - [Christina] What're you gonna do, you gonna stay here or you gonna move out? You're either gonna have to start working if you're gonna stay here, or-- - As long as I pay my rent there's nothing to worry about. - [Christina] Yeah, but you're gonna have to quit just loafing around all the time, you're gonna have to do something with yourself. - As long as I pay my rent. - [Christina] What are you gonna do about your dog? It has to go. If you're not gonna feed it, it has to go. - I'm gonna kill it and make steaks out of it. - [Christina] Are you gonna take it to the pound? - [Butch] No, I ain't gonna take nothin' to the pound. - Alright, then I'm gonna take it to the pound tomorrow. - [Butch] You're gonna walk it down there? - Well I imagine I'll find a way to take it. But I'm not gonna see it stay here and starve to death. So either you take it and give it to somebody tomorrow, give it a good home, or I'm gonna take it. - Why don't you grab your Playboy? Have somebody get you into Playgirl magazine. - Very funny. Are you about ready to come upstairs? I have a few chores for you to do. - Namely what? - Well, burn the garbage and clean up the yard a little bit. Would it kill ya? - You know I ain't gonna clean no yard. - Well, wouldn't hurt ya. - You know better though. - Well, c'mon up. - I'll be up when food is ready. What're we havin' for dinner? - [Maggie] Gotta wake my dad. Daddy, roller derby's on! - Uh-huh. - Roller derby's on! - Okay... - Get up! - Maggie? - Huh? - Tell Mama to fix Daddy something to eat. - [Maggie] Mommy Daddy wants somethin' to eat! Now get off, Shawn, alright, get off! Mommy, Shawn won't let anybody else on! - [Christina] It's his turn, then you can ride it. (squeaking hobby horse) - [Maggie] When is it my turn? (kids babbling and whining) I want my turn, put it on me. (newscaster speaking on TV) Unbutton me, Daddy. - Huh? - Unbutton me. - Okay, what're we gonna put on? - My dress. - Alright. - [Newscaster] Two of the best in the national jumped a few seconds. (Shawn snorting) - Stop that. That's not nice. - Be quiet, Shawn. - Shawn, go get your clothes. Here, put your shoes on. I told you to go get your clothes. - [Maggie] I don't know how! - Here. - [Sportscaster] Ladies and gentlemen, would you all please rise and join Miss Divine Turner in singing our national anthem. - [Maggie] Watch me move my head! It's going back and forth. ♪ Star Spangled Banner - Tie your shoelace? - [Christina] What's she called? - Paddle's stopped moving. - A paddle? - [Maggie] Yeah, when Daddy set up the TV! (crowd ambience) (ref whistle) (players shouting) - You stay out of the way! (ref whistling) (crowd shouting) You stay out of my way! (players grunting) (ref whistling) (crowd cheering wildly) - [Sportscaster] Here they go now, plenty up there! My, my, my, going around fast! - [Fan] Go, Annie, go! (crowd cheering) (players grunting) (crowd cheering on television) - [Sportscaster] Candy Jones, centered in the outside, hit by Joanie Weston, Weston, 38, with another block, blocks in there by Weston. - You want your shirt? - Yeah, thank you. - [Sportscaster] Neither man making a move yet, look at them move 'round that track though. There, that's quick! - Hey, did you see him hit him with his helmet! - [Sportscaster] Foster hits Roman, Saber hits Roman, hits him again-- (Mike grunts) - His wife's Angie or-- - He's always got his wife there. - [Sportscaster] Bombers are under in this first jam for 233. Chasing her, number 17. - 15 or 12. - Bombers are down. They always are and then pull it out. - [Sportscaster] And he does, going for a shoo-down - Oh! - Right in your own teammate! Playing your own teammate, nah! - [Sportscaster] Way behind the back, that's illegal blocking! That's more than 20 feet behind the back. Harmer's pulling off and calling the referee. (buzzer) (Christina laughing) Boy, they should take that rule right out of the rule book. It means absolutely nothing. He got up, after playing them, dumped into Weston again, this gal's going wild! - Oh lookit! Joanie Weston now! Uh oh, here it comes, there it comes, get her! Get her! (crowds cheering) - [Sportscaster] Weston coming back on the track! - Look out! - Uh oh! - Look at that, get 'em! Knocking everybody around! - She's, even that guy! - Yeah, even jumping on the guy! Oh, that Joanie! - Oh! Charlie oughta be in there! - Uh oh, he knocked her out! - No shit, a guy punched and knocked Joanie out! - Which one's that? - I dunno, but he better get there! - That was dirty, a guy punching a girl! (crowd cheering) - [Player] I never even touched ya! What kinda practice you think you're-- (crowd cheering wildly) (ref whistle) - She tried to knock me down! (players whooping) (crowd jeering) (ref whistle) (players grunting) - [Fan] Get that fucker! Get that! (unintelligible shouting) (crowd cheering) - [Fan] Right in the back of the fuckin' head. Alright, let's wipe 'em out! You mothers... (ref whistles) (bell ringing) (players shouting) (crowd jeering loudly) - [Jammer] Get out of my face! (ref whistles) (women screaming) - [Fan] Right in the belly! You should see all the hair you pulled out of her hair! (grunts) (ref whistles) (crowd cheering wildly) (patrons murmuring) - [Older Woman] You back to work, yet, Mikey? - I haven't quit work over there. - [Older Woman] You going to roller derby? - Yeah, I'm going to roller derby. - Are you? - Really. - [Older Woman] If I hadn't fallen since I skated I would! I just fall down as soon as I skate. - Oh yeah? - You ain't gonna fall down if you're gonna be one of those boys. - One of my sons, he was a terrific skater. He won, I don't know how many trophies and how many things, but, after he moved out to California, he just gave it up. - I can skate with-- - Lionel was no good at it. - Oh, I can skate with the ordinary. The first time I ever skated, I bust myself, I busted myself about three times. But I skated all night! I skated at Wallstay. Dances with 'em, and oh hell, I thought, boy, I'm good! I was good! - Yeah, I told Chris, we're gonna move to San Francisco. Yeah. I got to just take care of it out there, last night I talked to the manager, Charlie. I have to go to school out there, but I'm gonna try, I've been wanting to for a long time. I've got a couple trophies for speed. - [Older Woman] She'd probably like it out through there. I mean, I like California! - Yeah, I hope so! - Have you been out there? - Yeah, we've been to California, never been to San Francisco, but we've been to California. - We lived there in L.A., Anaheim-- - We were out there in L.A. - North of Hollywood, but I lived all around there. You know. - Uh huh. I'll try. - I think it'll be a barrel of fun! - [Mike] I do too! I was watching them in person last night-- - I watch whoever's there on television. - Oh, so do I, really! - I like that one girl that knocks 'em out-- - Oh, uh, what's her name now? - Oh, I love to watch her. - I can't think. Well, she's not with the San Francisco Bombers anymore. She's with, they went to another one called Oakland Bombers. - Yeah, the Oakland Bombers. - Yeah, she went with them. - Well she's good. - Yeah. It'll probably be a little rough at first. I'll have to work my way through it, and that should be, that's the only thing. - It'll be fun! - You did, you worked your way through? - No, well, I have to! - He's gonna have to, he said. - Oh, well, you're gonna get back in our days. (Mike laughing) I worked my way through-- - Anything new, you gotta work at to get, I don't care what it is. Nobody gives you nothing. - If they give it to you it ain't worth nothing. - That's right. You don't appreciate it, just hand it back to them. - Either that or you'll make a damn fool of yourself. That's right. You've gotta earn what you make! I learnt mine from a little kid, up. You remember, Colonel, you remember when I used to fight anything that he brought in the country? I used to wrestle 'em, I used to fight 'em, for an ice cream cone and a baloney sandwich! I'm a little dirtboy from Ohio, and that's my deal. That's my deal. (kids shouting) - Well this is where it started, almost 19, 20 years ago, right here, in this very spot, where we started our roller derby team. It was eight or nine of us boys that were skating around, and we played all different neighborhoods, right around this iron railing here. Which is pretty hard, I imagine. We hit it when we were kids, but it didn't, I never paid much attention to it. And we started the games at eight o'clock, which we tried to copy right from the original roller derby game, from that big tower clock up there, on Metropolitan Life. And I don't know, it's quite exciting for me to look back and go through the years and watch and see what happened to me, and come back to the big city and know that I'm gonna be playing in an arena that seats 19,000 people and it's gonna be completely gone. So my wish has come true as far as, I guess, I'm concerned, is making it big in roller derby. Hey, Dad? C'mon over here! Vic, c'mon over! This is my father here. And my wife. And my father goes back, like, 20 years, when I was saying a little while ago, and he used to come and watch me skate in this park and skate in the roller rink. So it's pretty hard to think that time has gone by this quick. And to realize that there's not gonna be much time left for my career as a skater, which, I hope it keeps going on, but I don't know if it will. I would give it a couple o'more years, and it's gonna be all passed, a whole quarter of a century in my life. But at that time, we used to have a lot of skating going on here. We don't see nothing now, you know. These kids are just running around and throwing dirt and stuff, where we was just skating. I dunno, I guess it's the time and change of every generation, and there's so many other things that kids are trying to listen to and do and fight, and picketing, and these kids like this here wouldn't even know, they don't even know what they're doing half the times, running around here, instead of getting into something good, some sports or anything. But now they just run around the streets, following people who are a little older who don't know what they're doing either. And they'll probably just stay here for the rest of their lives, just running in circles, and not really knowing what they've got in the future for them. But luckily, I was fortunate to get out of this town when I was 17 years old. And I still thank God and I thank my family that they let me go and become a skater. Because I come back here a couple of years ago and see some of my friends, they're not longer walking the streets. They've been sent away and put in penitentiaries, broken families and all that stuff, and I thank to God that I got into roller derby. And like I say, my family let me do it. They knew that was what I wanted. And I feel that I've justified myself in this business and made something of myself. And I'm very pleased, and like I say, tonight is gonna be a great thrill for me. To go back into Madison Square Garden, when I was a little kid, I used to sneak into that place. Now I'm gonna be walking through the door, and people are gonna be coming through the turnstiles just to see me and my team skate. (ref whistles) (echoing sportscaster on P.A.) (busy arena ambience) (ref whistle) (crowd cheers loudly) - [Sportscaster] Bobby's the lead jammer at 29.25 seconds! (excited echoes from P.A.) (crowd cheering) (ref whistle) (buzzer) - That's... Let's try and lock the one guy up around the outside. - Somebody gives one of you two guys a whip, the other one gets out, let him go. We'll just work for the point. Try to go for the point on each one, we got time, plenty of time. - [Sportscaster] For the Roller Derby Skate Company, manufacturers of America's only outdoor shoe-skate for the youngsters, the Roller Derby Street King. - And these jams, now, let's get these packs to break up. They'll stall at any time. (buzzer) (organ sports music) (ref whistling) (sportscaster echoing on P.A.) (crowd cheering) - [Sportscaster] Charlie O on the assist! 20 seconds! Reaching back, 10 seconds-- (crowd roars) (buzzer) (organ playing) (cheers and shouts) (buzzer) (organ sports music) Final score, Bay Bombers, 55, Midwest Pioneers, 52! (crowd roars) - Hey Jerry, man, why didn't you take a jump back and try to hit somebody and take and give us a whip out or something! Back there we had what, seven or 10 seconds to go, man. We had to get out right away, bam, boom. What's that, and everybody's out there taking, too worried about other things! Now we're the ones that got taken through the game! Let's get 'em every night. Hey Billy, you know, we're gonna have to work on our whip stuff too. Starting that stuff, I have to dig in again, yell at that pack. Every time you get to the front of that, you're already worn out. You have to take it and pace softly instead of just barreling on, just take it, get your wind again. - I'll work on that. Shoulda said something before, I didn't know you were having a tougher time. Got my hands full as it is with Charlie. Jesus. - Which hand, right or left? - Both of 'em. Man, it's something else. Some guys, we can, we can blast. Some of them don't recover that quick. Some of them get up quick enough and you shoulda been in there, you're not there, they're getting up and boom, gotta go back and try the same shit over again. And after one shot, man, boom. They're gonna be ready. - Hey Jerry, how come you don't sweat? - How come I don't sweat? - 'Cause it's a sign you're not doin' nothing! (Jerry laughs) - I got the bruises. - I'm doin' everything. - [Jerry] I got the bruises, not the sweat. - How much did I get ya? - This side o'me? - Were you the one I got? - [Midwest Player] Yeah, well, I was goin' the wrong way when I got up. I didn't know where everybody went! I thought everybody left me standing there. - I seen it when I hit that. I wasn't sure if it was you or the other one, Tony, that I wiped out. - Oh, shit, I never even-- - Next time I looked up, I seen Ronnie draped over the rail. - Who, Robinson? - Yeah, he was laying. Somebody got him or I got him. - Shit! I didn't see fuckin' nobody. I was thinking until we started running, you know, get 'em goin', and then I was, holy shit, I didn't know where you came from. - Son of a bitch! Dirty ol' floor burn. - [Bombers Player] And I seen Chris coming in the last bit of it. - He went right by me. - Well I go in to stop him, I didn't know how much we had a lead on goin' in. I mean, they had us-- - Three points after that one. - [Bombers Player] I thought we tied it up when we went over them guys. - No, we were two there. That one tied us up. Then when I got up and you guys took off and you were goin' through, he passed me-- - He kept comin' with us, I figured, well, we already got four on the jump goin' over. Okay, with Tony, I told him to keep going. I stopped with Eddie, I figured it's not good for going. I didn't know if he'd get up or what. - I don't think gave him the last point. - I don't think they gave him the last point, though, Eddie, because if we got the two, they go the one, that still puts them one ahead of us. - Was there only one in the lead? - There were two in the lead, going in. - One? - Two in the lead going in. - One. - I got that one before, it was 54, remember it was, 51, 50. - They gave it to him. - 55, they gave it to him. - Another game, another dollar. - I got bit in my dollar-- - We only got a month and a half to go home. Yeah, I can't wait. Gonna bake in the sun for awhile. (machinery humming) - [Foreman] Mister Snell operates an 88B machine. The capabilities of it should be somewhere around 120 tires on a 7.5-hour period. Snell has been with the company somewhere around three years. He never worked directly under my leadership as far as that goes, but I have been the foreman for that time. When he comes to work, he does a pretty decent job on his job. I mean, he should be able to get to work a little more often than what he does. - Say Snell, how you doin' there? How 'bout them glasses you're wearing there? - Well, I need 'em to see, really. - You need them to see? - Yeah. - Are they prescription? - Yeah. - Not just plain dark glasses? - No, they're not just plain dark glasses, have a look through 'em once. - Yeah, let's see these. - I got 'em through the deduction over there. - You did, huh? - Yeah. - You got 'em right from Dayton Tire, huh? - Well, they ok'd them. - They ok'd 'em. That's a pretty good deal then, huh? You'd rather wear those instead of safety goggles, huh? - Yeah, well, they're glasses, so they help me to see a lot. - Safety-wise, I'd be worried to take them off, if one of them tread rollers flipped out and hit you in the eyeball, and you get the glass in your eye? - [Mike] Well, a tread roller hitting this glass it won't break 'em. - It won't break 'em, huh? - Uh-uh, they're safety glasses. - Well I still think you oughta take 'em off anyway. What do you say? - Well, I really need 'em to see, though! - You really do, huh? - Yeah, really and truly. - Okay well, we'll hang onto wearing them now, but I'll run a test on 'em and break a pair and see what happens. - Okay. - Okay Snell, we'll see you later. - Alright then. - [Foreman] I've got no complaints about his work, he's a good worker. Like I say, when he's here, he's a good worker. (machinery humming) - [Security Guard] Long shift today, huh? Long stretch. - Can I help you? - Yes, I need to see about getting an application for a loan? - Okay, have you had an account here? - No, I haven't. - Okay, would you have a seat up front, what's the name please? - Robert Snell. - Okay, would you have a seat up front please, and I'll have Mister Hank speak with you, okay? - Okay, thank you. (knocking on door) - Yessir! Harry Hanks is my name. - Name's Mike Snell. - Pleasure to meet you. What can we do for ya? - [Mike] I'd like to see about getting a loan for $300. - You need a loan of 300? And what is that for? - It's to buy a Triumph motorcycle. - What year? - [Mike] '62. - Okay, and your last name is spelled how? - S-N-E-double-L. - First name? - [Mike] Michael Robert is how it goes. - Michael Robert. - Uh-huh. - And your age? - 23. - Are you married? - Yes. - Wife's name? - Christina. - And her age? - 22. - Number of dependents? - Uh, I have two children. - Your phone number? - We don't have a phone. - [Loan Manager] Are you buying your home or renting? - We're renting. - You pay how much a month? - 85 a month. - And your address? - 5334 West Third. - Your occupation? - I build tires. I work at Dayton Tire and Rubber. - And how long have you worked there? - [Mike] 16 months. - Where'd you work prior to that? - [Mike] Grants Pass, Oregon. - Okay, what's your take-home pay per week? - [Mike] Uh, right now it's about, oh, take-home? About 147 a week. - Okay, you have any other income? - [Mike] Oh yes, my wife works. - Where does she work? - [Mike] She works at the Gray Fox Lounge. - And how long has she been there? - [Mike] About four months. - And her take-home pay? - [Mike] Is about 95 a week. - Okay, any other income? - No. - Who do you owe at the present time? - [Mike] Uh, Dayton Tire Sales downtown. - And your balance there? - It should be about $90 right now. - And what are you paying a month? - No, They take it out a week. $6 a week. - Okay.

Have you ever dealt with a City Loan office? - No, sir, I haven't. - Okay. Now this will have to go through the regular channels and I won't be able to let you know until later on this afternoon. - Okay. Do you have an idea of approximately what time? - [Loan Manager] Oh, I'd say after four o'clock. - After four o'clock? - Mmhmm. - Can I give you a call down here then? - [Loan Manager] Yes, you can call me after four. - Okay. - Okay Mister Snell, nice to've met you sir! - Thank you very much! - Thanks for coming in. - Thank you! Hey Ray? Ray! Dog inside? - Yeah, he's inside. I'll talk to you about the bike. - Yeah. - What'd you do to your legs? - I was out riding this morning, turned it over, tore myself up a little bit. Tore my leg half off. - When you ever gonna learn? - (laughs) Never. Never gonna learn. - How's your hip? - It's alright. - [Mike] Heard Jim busted hisself up a little bit awhile back. - Yeah, he's got three ribs messed up now. - Gonna work today? - I dunno. (laughing) What've you been doin'? - Not much. Gonna leave Dayton Tire before long. - Quittin'? - Yeah! - [Ray] Gonna skate? That's the only way. - Yeah, I mean, I had enough of it. - Well here it is. - Very nice. How much you askin' for it, Ray? - 600. - It's pretty nice, but I don't think I can afford that right now. Maybe I can talk you down a little bit? - I dunno! Y'have to talk to my wife, it's my wife's bike! So... - Yeah, I'm supposed to know about the loan money today. I might be out there, 600. - So you're gonna be in the roller derbies, huh? - Yeah, I'm gonna try, for awhile. - You got trophies for that, don't you? - [Mike] Yeah, for speed skating, I got some for. That's why I figured I'd make it in it pretty decent. I'll be leaving, probably, in two weeks or so. - [Ray] Is your wife going out with you? - [Mike] Yeah, well, she's not going out with me right now, later on she's comin' out. She's not going out right now. - It's in real good shape, she took real good care of it. - [Mike] Yeah, it looks like it is, in nice condition. - I seen it just sit around. - Might as well see me get killed on it instead of sit around! (laughing) - [Ray] Nah, if you ride 'em right you won't get killed. You just don't act crazy. - I know, but what about all these cars! - Well you either gotta be behind them or out in front of 'em. That's the only way I figured. - [Mike] Y'ain't got a key for me to start it, do you? - No, I dunno if, let me see. Fuel may have drained down the bottom. I have to, no... Want to hear it run? - Yeah! - It's outta gas. - Is it? (laughing) - It ain't got no gas! You'd have to go get some. - [Mike] I can come over later on. I'm gonna take it for a ride before I buy it anyway. - Yeah, okay, it runs real good. And I'll get some air in the tire, it's a little bit low, and have gas in when you come back over and you can take a ride on it. - Alright, I'll see how my loan works out today. - Okay. - You know, we're just gonna get in there in time to take a shower and go to the building, huh! - [Janet] I know, that's what I was saying. Get in there, put our monkeysuits on, and that's it. - And then tomorrow morning, we leave, what, what was that, 11? - What, 11? - Was it 11 to catch that flight? - How many miles is it? Oh no, 10! - 10 o'clock in the morning? - Right! - You're kidding! - No, we have to leave, I think, either we're leaving at 10 or we have to be at the airport at 10, and then when we come back, we have, we're leaving at 6:30 in the morning. - [Lydia] I know, and then we have a game, too. - I think some of those kids are gonna miss that plane. Don't forget, we have to polish our skates, too. - That's now too bad. I'm not superstitious like some people are about polishing your skates. Like I think it's Maureen, she polished her skates, when was it, one night, and broke her-- - Broke her ankle? - Broke her ankle, yeah. - Annie is too! - Annie is too? - Yeah, remember what-- - Yeah, but you remember when the boss walked in, she didn't say too much. She just sat up there like the rest of us. (laughs) Took it all in. - I said, can I clean my skate on, the outside of one skate and the inside of the other one? That's all they ever see, anyway. Almost bit my head off! - Hey, Janet. - Huh? - Did you hear those people last night, when we was on that track, talking about our hair? - Uh uh. - Talking about my hair? - What? - Talking about the police, what the police to do my hair? I was too embarrassed! Yes! This man, he was shouting all that, and then on the other side, on our left-hand side was a soul sister. And you could hear her say, "Oh, she tryin' "to get hair like us!" (laughing) - [Janet] She's gonna take lessons, huh! - Yeah, tell me! - Weirdo One and Two. - I just, you know-- - It depends on, you know-- - Where you're at, too. - Right. - [Lydia] I bet you, we go to New York, the people probably wouldn't even pay no-- - They won't even look at us, right! Same thing like in L.A. Or even in San Francisco, they wouldn't even turn around. Here you walk dow the street, and if you turn around, you know they're turning around looking back at you. - Just like J.J. and Taft. You know, last night, they were talking about us. Talking about how, you know how they straighten their hair? - Uh huh. - Well Taft and, you know, J.J. straighten it. And they said, "Look at us! "We're trying to wear white peoples' hair, "and they're wearing soul peoples' hair!" - [Janet] Right. Shoot, we probably won't get in and in our room 'til six now. This is worse than that time, Lydia, where were we? Where we came and did laundry? Put our suitcases down, did laundry, came back? - Uh, Steubenville. - Right. - Steubenville, Ohio, where we just came in, had enough time to go do our laundry, come back, shower, jump in our monkeysuit, go to the game. - We don't even have, that monkeysuit, I just look at it and it jumps on me now. Don't even have to take it out of the closet. There's our 14-cent White Castle hamburgers. - [Lydia] What's his name, Bill? - Who, behind us? - No, I says-- - Oh yeah. - We have to wait for him? - [Janet] I sure hope he can find that hotel. - Oh well. - [Janet] 'Course, if he couldn't find it, you know, we wouldn't have to skate tonight. - That sounds good. But that's all we would need. Then we'd really be on their shit list. (motor starting) - [Mike] Where'd you tell your old lady you's goin' tonight? - [Roger] I told her I had to go in early. - Crazy. I told mine we was working tonight. Well where would you take 'em tonight, any idea? - Hell, Mike, I don't know. - Well, I thought about Diamond Club, I heard it on the radio, where it's that $3 night, you know? Just, you know, $2 for the girl and a dollar for you and all you can drink. - Champagne night, or something, isn't it? - Yeah, how much money you got on you? - About 10 bucks. - [Mike] I got about eight, so if we go out there-- - [Roger] Figure five for gas, though. - [Mike] Yeah, we'll go out there, at least we'll, you know, won't look so bad, and we'll still have some money, you know. But I told 'em we'd be there shortly. - How much time we got? - We got about half an hour before we got to be there yet. But that was a, plan on takin' them to a motel later on. And I'm staying all night with Anne, I don't know about you. - Definitely, man, definitely. - [Mike] I got to, 'cause I ain't had it yet. I think we'll take 'em out to Diamond Club, you know, and later on, maybe, one of us go up in a motel for the four of us. Or else we could go to Sharon's house all night, 'cause her old man ain't there! - [Roger] Yeah, but I ain't too hip on being on Sharon and if her old man come in, you know! - [Mike] No, that wouldn't be too good for him to walk in on us like that. But, we could go to a motel just as well. - Yeah. - Yeah. - Could go to Holiday, they got colored television. It gets worse every year. You just meet more and more women. - [Mike] I just wish that Anne had bigger tits as my old lady does. - [Roger] You can't have everything, man. - [Mike] Well, I know, but, and I wish Anne could fuck like Donna does! You know? (both laughing) And I'm hoping that Marsha's gonna be like all of 'em, 'cause she's got jugs like my old lady, but she's big like my old lady is, you know? And Anne is small where-- - I like little girls. - Yeah, so do I! I know they ain't gonna kick my ass! (motor revving) (tires squealing) (bongos and sharp cuts of pop songs) - That's alright, yeah? - It's real good dancing, except for her face! - [Emcee] C'mon Doris, honey, don't just up stand there, take your clothes off, baby! (bongo drumming) (sharp edits of pop songs) (girl whooping) - [Mike] I sure would! (bongos and sharp edits of pop songs) (laughter) (whistles) - [Emcee] That's your moneymaker! Shake it, baby, shake it! (short sharp edits of pop songs) - Boy, that girl, look at that! (short sharp edits of pop songs) - Remember, join in the action spot! - Sitting out in front of the house, hollering for him. - Yeah, the nerve to come right out front of the house and sit there and holler for our husbands to come out the door. And us sitting there. - Would you come outside and talk to us? We want to ask you about comin' by and blowin' the horn again. - Why? - Every night. - Because I feel like it. - [Christina] Well I thought after I asked you to that night you wouldn't do it anymore. - She said she'd call the law, so I said I'd go by there any time I pleased. - Yeah, but Donna, I asked you not to, because you were waking my kids up, too! And I sat right out in front of the house that one night and asked you not to blow that horn anymore. - [Donna] Well, tell people to quit going by here and blowing it at four or five in the morning. - Well who's been going by the house in the morning? - [Donna] I don't know, man. - Well we know it's not Mike or Roger, because they haven't been out, Donna. - Yeah they were, they was out the other night. - No they weren't! - Which night? - Two o'clock in the morning. - Which night? - Night before last. - Night before last, they come by here and blow the horn? - Mmhmm. - Did they stop? - Mm-mm. So I went out and asked them both. Roger and Mike. - Well are you ready to tell me what's been going on between you and Mike? - Nothin' yet, why? - Because he already, they already both admitted they've been taking turns with ya. - [Donna] Well I'm sorry, but they haven't. - Man, they have, haven't they? - Now why were they admitting it, Donna? - I ain't seen Roger since that night I was at the house! - Well we're talking about from before then. - Oh I've been out with Roger, yeah. - Well I know you've been out with Roger because he told me. Mike said he's been out with you too. - Well, I told you that. Well, mm-hmm. - Well why would you lie about it? - Why didn't you tell us before when I asked you? - I didn't go out with him yet. Well, hell, you say to him, every day, there goes your girlfriend by the house, and Roger says the same thing. - [Christina] Well when you're blowing the horn everyone knows who it is! (horn honks) - Well, there's people who live across the street from me I know too! - Well why wouldn't you tell us when you did it, when we could see you out there that night she's up the house? - What night? - That night Mike came here and asked you why you been out there blowing, you says, "No, it wasn't me!" - I said, I went by the house, and I said, I'll continue going by the house! - [Roger's Wife] Yeah, but you said it when you were hollering. - I didn't holler! - You did! I stand right there and I see you! - Janet hollered! - Janet didn't holler, it's your damn mouth, you mouthbaby. - [Christina] Well one night you stopped out in front of the house and she was there with another girl? - Yeah? - What were they there for? - Janet wanted to see Roger. He's been out with her last week, that's what I heard. - No, he ain't. She's full of shit, and I'll tell-- - Well that's what she told me, she said that she went out with him. - Because Roger has not been out without me. - (laughing) She lies worse than I do! - He ain't been anywhere, he ain't even been late coming home. - He has been nowhere without me. - Except for the night he was at the Sesame Club with us. - With Mike, and with you. - He came home with us. Roger says that you're the one that was going out with Mike. - [Donna] Oh bullshit, I was going out with Roger. - Well I sure would like to get it straight, who's doing what. - 'Cause I had his ring. Remember when he didn't have his ring, he asked you where it was at? - [Roger's Wife] He didn't ever not have his ring. - [Donna] His class ring. - His class ring? - Yeah. - [Roger's Wife] His class ring, as far as I know, has always been there. - [Donna] Well, it wasn't for almost two weeks. 'Cause I had it. And he told he said that, when you asked him, that he left it at work. - No. That's just like this, Donna. I told Roger, if he wanted to, he could have you. Because he told me about-- - Honey, I don't want him! - That you called him over to the body shop, wanting him to move in with ya. He told me about that. - No, bullshit. THat's a damn lie, and I'll tell him to my face. - I don't care what you say, I mean, I told him, if he wanted you, he could have you. But he said he didn't want you, 'cause he didn't think you's nothing but a damn bitch. That's what he said. - Well power to him if that's what he feels, he ain't the only one that thinks it. - [Roger's Wife] If you want to keep on with it, I don't want you by and blowin' the horn. - [Donna] Honey, there's lots more people on that goddamn street than you! - [Roger's Wife] Well dammit, Donna, it gets pretty tiring when you have to get up at four and five o'clock in the damn morning with a baby crying! Yeah, you do have to! - Well you're out peeking out the damn windows anyway! - No I'm not! When the baby's up, to see who in the hell it is blowing! - Well, that's not down. - Don't say it ain't you! - Kiss my ass! - I don't wanna kiss it! - Oh yeah? - Well I know you've been by out there in the morning, because-- - About your beloved husband, I don't want him! - Well then leave him alone! - I don't have him, honey, I ain't spoke to him since that night I was up there. And he ain't spoken to me! Okay, I don't want youse back here no more. - [Christina] Well, like, I go home and tell Mike-- - I don't want him anyway. - Well I know, but I tell Mike he's gonna bring me up here so that you'll admit it in front of him. - Well I don't care. Just don't come back to my yard. - And just admit it! - Admit what? - Admit what you just told me! In front of his face! - Oh I ain't scared of you! Bring him by! - Well that's what I mean. - And don't you stand in my fucking yard no more. - [Roger's Wife] Well just quit your damn blowing, and I won't, 'cause I don't want a damn thing to do with you! - I don't want your husband, why don't you get out of my yard, get out of my yard now, girl! - Well just stay away, Donna, or the cops will be calling this time. - Yeah, we'll see about it. - They will be! - We'll probably be back 'cause once Mike, if Mike denies it, I know he's gonna come up here. If I have to drag him-- - I don't wanna hear you or anybody else about this. - Yeah, but, like I say, you already admitted it once. - Well? - So, if you're gonna admit it in front of me? Why can't you admit it in front of him then? - [Donna] I will, I admitted it! - That's all I want you to do! - [Donna] I don't want you in my yard no more. - Alright, we'll stay down here at the street, you can come out to the car. - Alright. - Or is that your yard too? - Nope. - Okay. Well, we're public. - I know, like it's, it's funny, a lot of people frown upon skaters as not being really either intelligent people, or a lower class of life. But what they don't know is, like, 90% of other skaters have gone through college and stuff of this nature. Myself, I just completed high school, 'cause I was skating when I was 15, and skating while I was still in school. It makes it rough sometimes, you come up against a lot of people, and it's hard to talk with them and deal with them if you're not really up on it and sharp. It makes me mad, you know, with little things like this. And like, myself, I enjoy skating, I love to skate. I think it's really a ball. (crowd cheering) It's a lot of work, a lot of hard knocks, and scars, and sores, and teeth getting knocked out, bruises, can't sleep at night 'cause something hurts. But on the whole, I really enjoy it. I think it's really fun. And there's good money in it. (crowds cheering) - [Fan] C'mon Eddie! - And like, I don't know. Everything, to me, it fits in place. I love skating, I love the roughness of it, I love the contact of it. I mean, even, in the street it's the same way to me. Skating, I don't back down, when I'm outside, even in the street, I don't back down to anybody. (horns blowing) (crowds cheering) I think that's what your difference is between your average skater and your top skater, is just your personal drive that you're gonna be top and you're not gonna back down from no one. And right now, as far as our team, we've got a pretty good team. There's still some kids that, they'll stand up, but once they get hit too hard, they'll back down. With me, the harder I get hit, the more I want to come back in for more. (crowds cheering) (players grunting) - [Fan] C'mon Eddie, get him! (bells ringing) (crowds cheering) - So I figure, if they're gonna hit me one time, I'm gonna give back to them. Sooner or later, they can't win all the time. (crowds cheering) (ref whistling) We've had a lot of instances where people have come to our motel and tried to start a lot of trouble. And have tried to break into rooms and stuff of this nature. And I feel that, I'm not gonna stand there and have somebody break into my room and really hurt me and put me in the hospital where I can't skate, which is my livelihood. I mean, I'm not gonna, I wouldn't shoot anybody unnecessarily. But I think, if the time would come down to it, I would shoot somebody. And then there's a lot of times in the car, and some of the girls, guys have tried to pick 'em up and stuff, run 'em off the road, into ditches. And you never know, like, possibly they have rape or something like this on their mind. And I think it's a good thing to have, like, especially in a car, one guy in the car with the girls, and to have something. Because I know quite a few of the skaters do carry a gun around in their suitcase or in their car, in case something of this nature does come up. I mean, I've never had to use it yet, or even to pull it yet. Maybe some day I will, and I'd rather be prepared for it than to be sorry that I didn't have it. It's an old Italian 25 automatic, which isn't good for long range, it's just good for close range, in case somebody would break into your room and be right here up on you. - They really hit us, some NVA, really know how to fight over there. Big Chinese-- - What's NVA? - North Vietnamese Army. And there are two kinda people you're fighting. You're fighting the Vietcong, which is the people in the black pajamas. Well, they wear, you don't know who they are. You could be walking through rice paddies, and walk past these people, you know, working in the rice, and all of a sudden, they jump up, shoot you from behind, and you look around and there's nobody there. They're still, everybody's working in the rice paddies and you don't know who did it. You can't shoot the good people, and you can't shoot the bad. So, and the terrorists, they come and-- - If they're in black pajamas, you could easily see them. - [Paul] Everybody's in black pajamas! - Oh! - Everybody. - Is women over there dirty too? - Well, dirty, they, I seen this one woman sitting still, she had a cigar about that long. And I think she probably had it about six months before, her teeth was black, and they mess with bombs, and they put acid in Cokes, and anything like that. Little kids with-- - I heard, little kids put glass inside of ice cubes and all that. - No, you buy it from the villagers. - You know, he's gotta go for his physical now. - That's good, that's, why don't you join the Reserves, the Navy Reserves or something? - For six years? No way! No way. - Alright. Join the Army for two years, and die in about a year in Vietnam, maybe. No way, say no way now! - I won't go to Vietnam. - (scoffs) That's what I said, I won't go to Vietnam. - He said he's gonna go AWOL, 'cause he don't care. - [Paul] What, are you afraid of it or what? - I'm afraid of going to Vietnam. - Why? - Not everybody gets killed! I was talking to Bierheiser, another guy I know, and he says he didn't even get to see somebody get shot! - Aw, I really want to see somebody get shot. - [Paul] Uh, it's, you, you're lucky-- - I'm a lover not a fighter. - I'll tell you one thing I believe, I believe that, I don't care what anybody says, that when it's your time to die, you're gonna die. 'Cause you come to death so close over here, I mean, you just, I said out loud two, three times, "I know I'm dead." And I just didn't die. The grenade, their ChiCom, same as our grenade, they call it ChiCom, it just didn't go off. Bounced off a tree beside you or off your chest, and you look at it and you know you're dead, but a miracle or the Lord or somebody's with you. - I think it'd be a good thing for me to go over there, I really do. - How close have you come to a grenade? - Once it bounced off my chest! - What! - Right, one of them ChiComs. - I don't want nothin' like that! (chuckles) - But when I got shot, I got hit. I run right into the Gook that shot me. And, they got all kinds of different grenades, and one of them is an illumination grenade. You pull it and you throw it at night, and it lights up. I threw one of them at this Gook that shot me, but the NVA, you call them Gooks I guess-- - Was it burning? - No, it didn't, I just popped, if it woulda been a fragmentation grenade it woulda killed him! - I mean, did it blind him or anything? - No, just fizzled. - Why didn't you shoot him when he was there? - Because I was shot in the hand, I got shot in the hand, and I was behind a little sand dune, and I threw the grenade, I thought it was a fragmentation grenade. And he's standing there smiling, you know, it fizzles and goes off. So I throw another one at him and go him out of his hole. - You killed him then. - Yeah. - [Butch] How do you feel about that? - I'm alive. - It was him or Paul! - Don't you feel bad about killing a guy though? - [Paul] No, it don't bother me at all. - [Butch] That's what they teach you in the Marines, that you hate Gooks. - No, they don't teach you that, Butch. The only thing, they teach you discipline, and teach you how to fight. - I never went to the service. They wouldn't take me 'cause I got married just for, I believe it was just when they passed that law, remember when that law was passed? - Yeah, married. - Yeah. They were starting to take married people in. - Right. - And I think I beat it about three days. - Do you think Butch ought to join the army? - I think he ought to join something. 'Cause once he gets drafted, he ain't gonna have his choice then. Tell him he could learn something in the service, though. - [Paul] He could! You might like it, Butch, and make a career out of it, you can never tell. - [Mike] Yeah, you gotta work somewhere in 20 years, don't ya? - I have thought about that, but... - You gotta work somewhere in 20 years. - Right? Why have you got this bad thing about service? Why don't you want to go in? People talk to you, or what? You like these hippies running around, or what? - Yeah. - Huh? - [Mike] He's afraid he's gonna lose his hair! - [Paul] Right, afraid we're gonna cut your hair off, or what? - I don't like going around bald, let's put it that way. I like my hair, I like the way it is! - [Paul's Wife] And what about goin' out there, not knowing anybody? - Well, it'd be about like when we went to Oregon, we didn't know anybody when we went out there. But we met 'em. He wants to go, he is set on doing the roller derby. So, that's what he wants, I guess I'll let him do it. (laughs) - Do you want him to? - Well, if he's sure about it. You know, sure that's what he wants. Because he has to leave, he'll be leaving an awful good job to go to it. But as long as he's sure that he wants to do that, and that's what he wants to stay with, it's alright with me. Let me use your lighter. He's talked about the roller derby, he's wanted to join it for a long time. And before, he didn't weigh enough or something, so he never could get in it. But once we talked to them, he's really set on it now. But he found out where to take the schooling, and-- - [Paul's Wife] It surprised me, he'd never mentioned it before. You know, he used to watch it-- - Yeah, you know he watches it all the time. Every Saturday he's in front of that TV when it's on. - [Paul's Wife] He never mentioned wanting to skate. - Oh he loves to roller skate. His dad's really for it. He's a roller derby fan too. He's worse than what Mike is on roller derby, if that's possible! He was, he's tickled to death. He's so proud because Mike's gonna go into the roller derby. - Is your dad still in the hospital? - Yeah, he's down there. He's all up tight, he's real excited about me going to roller derby. You don't think it's a good idea, huh? - (chuckles) Roller derby, I don't know, Mike. - They start out 12,000 a year! - How long, how long're you gonna last? - Look at Charlie O, he's making 50-grand a year now! - What's the matter with what you've got here, man? - What's so hot about me? - What are you making a year, how much money? - 12,000. - And how much are you gonna make out there? - But that's, I don't like to go to a factory, you don't work in a factory! - No, I drive a tractor truck! - Alright, there's a lot of difference there! - Why, though, what if it flops? - Okay, I'll come back then. - Aren't you happy with what you got? - No! - Aw man, you just-- - Are you happy with what you got? You're perfectly happy, you wouldn't be interested at all in bettering yourself? - Are you calling this you bettering yourself, goin' out there and roller skating? - You're damn right! - You don't even know what you're getting into! - Hey, Columbus didn't know what he was getting into when he jumped into the ocean, did he? - [Paul] No, but what was he doing before he started discovering America? Did he have a good job, and have a home, and have a nice couple of kids? - He musta been pretty well off to talk the queen into giving him three ships! - Aw, man. Do you think it's right being away from, how long're you gonna be up there? - I don't plan on, they say it's six to eight weeks for school but I intend on cutting it to three. - How are you gonna do that? - 'Cause I'm good, that's how I'm gonna do it! - Oh, and is that gonna feed your family and children? - No, but Chris is working, and the $70 a week from sick leave will feed my family. - Oh, so, do you think that's right? Pulling a sick leave at Dayton Tire and Rubber? - Oh, come on with the "Oh lord" stuff! Now you ain't never pulled nothing over a company, is that what you-- - Mike-- - Now let me tell you-- - You're bullheaded, it's like talkin' too-- - Wait, wait a minute! - You won't listen, man! - Didn't you ever go to fake sick-call a service or nothing? Nothing like that, Paul? - Would you listen? - I'm asking you a question. - Yes, yes. - Oh, but it's wrong for me, but it's right for you! - Man, let me tell you something. - Now, you tell me, you just tell me. What have I lost, really, going out there? - What have you gained? - I might gain a whole new career, Paul. - A career, man, you've got a career, you've got a wife and kids! - Aw, Dayton Tire and Rubber, whoopdie doo! - [Paul] Do them roller derby guys go all over the place? - Yeah. - [Paul] Are they ever home and got a family, I don't know! - Yeah, some of 'em are even married and skate on the same team, Paul! - [Paul] Oh now we're gonna get our old lady roller skating! - No, my lady can't roller skate worth shit! - If you like it, if you like to roller skate-- - I like it, I like it. - If it works out perfect, Mike, it's all good. If it works out perfect. - Alright, will you say "good" if it works out perfect? - Yeah but if it don't, what're you gonna do? - I'll say you were right! - No, but see-- - No, wait a minute! If it works out perfect, will you say, "You really made the right choice"? Will you really? - Yeah. - Okay, well I'm gonna make you say it, say it on TV when we're on there sometime, to say, "I told this boy not to do this, "but I was wrong, he was right for a change!" - C'mon man! - You'll say, "I'm just a dumb driver, I don't know nothing!" You got to understand that! - Well, this is a long way from the track that I was at. It's about 3,000 miles from New York City, and this is what I call God's Heaven. This is my home, where me and my wife Vic started to plan this thing about a year and a half ago, and we're finally getting it to come true now. We've got most of it all completed, we've got the insides all finished, the pool's now, it's all laid out perfect. The only thing we're gonna do right now, being that the road trip has just ended, is sit around and relax for awhile. And on that complete road tour, that we went to see all the people back east, was 27,000 miles, and we did that in four and a half months. So it was pretty tough, on everybody concerned. And we always, people ask ya, what are you going to do, you know, when you're finished skating? Well this is why this house was built. And this is why this pool was put in here. For our relaxation, and to try and make it feel good to lay back and say it was worth it for all them road tours, and all them nights of getting your head beat in. And broken bones and stuff. This is what I've got to show for it now. It's my house, and a beautiful place up here in heaven, that I consider it. And we overlook everything here in Hayward, Oakland, you can see San Mateo, all the bridges, but like I say, you'll probably see for yourself, looking around, that it is beautiful here. And this is where most of the skaters intend to do, and most of them want to do, is build a home someplace where they can hide away and really enjoy life. And this, to me, is my enjoyment. Is building this place, and putting it together, stone by stone, pouring this cement, planting the flowers, and even doing some moonlight swimming at, like, four or five o'clock in the morning, whenever we want. Which we done the other night! (laughs) We had a ball in here. We had some company. And it's really a wild thing, I haven't done it since I was a kid. Just come out, and it was so hot up here, and it was five o'clock in the morning. We had a little mist up here, but we had a ball in this place. So, this is the hideout for all of us, and like I say, I'm gonna enjoy it. And this is my retirement place, is right here. - Whattaya say, Dad? - Mike! - How're you doing? - Alright. - Where'd you get them socks at? - Oh, I've had 'em! I can get 'em every time I come to the hospital. - Yeah, I remember that. I'll be leaving Monday, I guess. - Who're you going with? - I think I'm gonna drive by myself, Chris's gonna stay here. I'm gonna drive a bike out there. - You really gonna skate with them? - Yeah. - You know I always wanted you to skate. - Yeah I know. I remember all the times we used to go skating out at Triangle? - Yeah. - It's a shame they closed it. - I liked the skating rink out there. - [Mike] I did too, oh, I gotta get another pair of skates, since my old ones won't fit me no more. - Do I get 'em? - Yeah, I guess! (laughing) - Will I get able to skate? - Yeah, you ready to go? - Yeah, I believe I'll get out tomorrow. - Yeah, Chris, though, I don't think she appreciates me leaving Dayton Tire too much. - [Dad] She likes that you're skating, though. - Yeah, I hope so. She just don't like Frisco too much, though. That's the only thing. - [Dad] Will you go with Charlie? - Yeah, I guess I'll on his team. I hope I can be on his team, anyway. I'd hate to skate against him! - [Dad] Well I sure would! - Right now, I really think I'm better than that lot, they are right now. I really do think that. - Don't be good, be better! - I'm the best! I'm gonna be, that's the way. - It's not gonna be a lot of fun, I think, but I know you'll make it. - [Mike] Yeah, well I gotta make it. If I don't do nothing else right, I gotta make it. - Well when you come to Dayton, I'll watch you skate. - Well yeah, I guess! - I'll be down at ringside. - Well everybody I know will come out there and watch me skate when I skate Dayton. Or Cincinnati as well. - Sure would like to make it, I sure would like to make it. - [Mike] Well, I've got to make it. (laughs) - If you go, how long will it take before you'll be back? - Well, they said the average training is six to eight weeks, but I think I can cut it down to about three weeks. Butch is goin' with us. - Is he going? Is he gonna try to skate? - No, he's just going out there to get a job. He's gonna, after I'm already out there, he's gonna drive Chris and the kids out later. - She'll help you out a little. You want to get out to earn, get to training, and then quick as you can, come back and take care of Chris? - [Mike] Well, she'll be out there. - And whatever you gonna do, furniture and all that? - Well we can't take our furniture with us. We'll have to sell that like we did last time. I think I'll be able to support this with roller derby. - I hope you can. 'Cause I want you to make good, if you want to do it, all out of it as you can. - Yeah, I will try. I gotta pop in to see this guy downtown at 12 o'clock, so I'll be back later on tonight or tomorrow. - See you then, boy. - Take it easy here. - I want you making good out of this, now. - Don't run them nurses ragged. - No, they're good to me! - Alright, we'll see you later, Dad. - I'll get out of here soon. - Okay, take it easy. - Yeah, bye! - Oh, Cavello, Kreb, I like them both. They're kinda mean, I like 'em. Some of 'em on here, I don't know all of 'em on here. There's some new ones. And of course we like our other team the best. We like for 'em to fight, a little action. - You wait 'til I come back, you're gonna be so sorry when I come back skating! Don't let her go! (ref whistling) I didn't do it, I didn't do it! Come on, Lydia, come on, Lydia, get her! - Get her, Lydia! - C'mon Lydia, get her Lydia! (crowd roaring) - We start a lot of arguments, anyhow, get 'em mad at us, so they get, then they get mad at the players and we get a little action. That's why we holler at 'em, and fight with 'em, try to get a little action, because we see a lot of action on TV, we like to see it when we come to it. (crowd cheering loudly) (jeering whistles) She's been coming to 'em since she was about three years old. She hasn't missed one of 'em since St. Louis. - Yeah. - What do you think about 'em? - I think they're okay. - What d'you like about 'em? - I like to see the fights! (crowd cheering) (players grunting) - [Player] You okay? - [Ref] Man, he cut his skull on that shot. - [Player] You alright? - I'm helping, help him. - Get him up, get him up. (crowds cheering) - Uh, yeah, I'd like to call in to say I'll be a little late. Robert Snell. S-N-E-double-L. S-N-E-L-L. Yeah. 1:30. 41-24. Yeah, I'll be a little late, I'll be in by lunchtime. It's 2:15 we eat lunch. Pardon? Yes. Okay? I'm having a little car trouble right now. Okay, thank you. - [Announcer] Both teams now on the track, ladies and gentlemen, before we proceed any further, would you all please rise for our national anthem. (static and pops on P.A.) (organ chord) We believe, under the circumstances, the record is probably broken, we will dispense with the national anthem this evening. (crowd laughing and murmuring) (crowd cheering) (organ playing sports music) (derby bout ambience) (end-of-bout buzzer)
