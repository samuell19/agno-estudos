# It doesn't seem so long ago # We laughed and joked with dear old Joe # Then Joe departed from this Earth # But he's around to share our mirth # Some vandal committed desecration # And now we ask in desperate desperation # Oh, we'd # Like to find the guy who took his ashes # In the urn that stood in front his bungalow # For the urn in which the scoundrel flicked his ashes # Held the ashes of our dear, departed Joe # Oh, we'd like to trace the fiend who cigaretted # Nonchalantly flicking ashes for a joke # Well, if that's a joke, believe us, we don't get it # And we know it wasn't Joe, he didn't smoke # It was I who accidentally spilled the ashes on that day # And the wind blew none too gently # Scattering most of them away # And believe me I've been busy makin' up for what I spilled # I've been smokin' till I'm dizzy, but it's filled # It's filled # Oh, it's not so much because you pulled a boner # That is making us displeased, we'll have you know # It is just we'll never know an El Corona # From the ashes of our dear, departed Joe # Our dear # Old # Joe Well, what are you looking at? I'm not trying to learn the combination, sir. Oh, no? What were you looking at then? Nothing, sir. I was just dreaming of my home in merry old England. Well, do your merry old dreaming on your own time, will you? I think I've proven that you can trust me, sir. I don't trust anyone. I wanna understand, sir. You're a pretty smart fellow, Stumpy. Thank you, sir. But don't get too smart. Oh, no, sir. Hey there, Ike. Lend me 50, will ya, Steve? Hey, you're a freaking freighter. That's why you got it and I ain't. Now you'll get rich a lot sooner haulin' it than I will diggin' it. All right. A dollar for a drink of whiskey, it's robbery, that's what it is. You steal it from the ground, we steal it from you. What's the difference? He is right, I took out close to 5,000 post gold Wednesday. And they found Charlie in the goats with a bullet in his head. United States Marshal's all right. But he ain't bulletproof. Hello, Bill. Gary, Gary Corbett. - Say, don't you ever change? - Oh-ho-ho, Gary. Boys, I want you to meet Pop Corbett's son. This is Steve Jones. - Howdy, Corbett. - Howdy. - And this is... - Bailey, Joe Bailey. Glad to meet you, Bailey. What are you doing in Moose River? I thought you were in the States, learning all there is to know about mines. I was, but now I know all about it and I'm here to help Pop with his. I hear it's a whopper. Well, if it is, Pop and you won't have it long. - What do you mean? - You'll sell out. Oh, no, we won't. Oh, yes, you will, or lose it all together. Looks like we find mines to stake 'em out for the syndicate, not for ourselves. No, we sell 'em cheap or they kick us off. Well, what happened to the law? The law's on a vacation up here. Ask your friend Pete. Well, I aim to but, I missed him at the post office. Oh, well, he'll show up later. Have a little drink? Thanks, I don't mind if I do. - Oh, good evening, gentlemen. - Good evening. Well, how's the Chamber of Commerce tonight? Fine, thanks. Hey, as a rule, you should change the name of this place from the Palace to the. Yeah, how would you like to make a trade? Your place here for half interest in my bank. Well, I don't know what for. After all, they withdraw their money from you and deposit it with me. I'd gladly give you my entire store for an interest in Roxie there. That's a deal, your store and all the gold in Alaska and all the tea in China. Uh, huh. - Well, have a good time. - Thanks. # This is the story of a fool and his gold - Come on, let's get a table. # This is the story # That has never been told # I'll tell you how it started # And how they really parted # Just listen to my fable unfold # There was a lady who was painted and bold # Skin just like marble and a heart twice as cold # The gold was her religion # And he was such a pigeon # More pity on that fool and his gold # His poor old heart was brittle # Of love he'd been bereft # He asked for oh so little # And that's exactly all that she left Come on let's have a lot of drinks. You know I ain't no minor, I'm a sailor. I can drink plenty, I'm tellin' ya. All right, sailor, but quiet down, give the lady a chance to sing. What? # This is a story of a fool and his gold # Proving the difference... Oh, I can sing better than that with one had tied behind my back. Hey, pipe down, sailor. Hey, don't tell me to pipe down. Hey, let's have some more drink, come on! Oh, I'll teach you fellas how to drink. You don't know how. Hey, don't leave me, don't leave me. Hey, don't leave, where we goin'? # That painted gold collector # Is the only one who really got stuck # This is the payoff and it's time that it's told # True that she took him for his bundle of gold # Here's the part that's funny # It was stolen money # All her work was wasted # 'Cause the sheriff traced it # Found it on her person # And which there's nothing worsen # Whosie goes to prison # Who taketh what ain't hisen # So don't be smart and try to part a fool # And his gold Hey Nick, who busted up my number? Some big guy down there. Hello, stranger. Hello. How'd you like my act? Well, it gets you a drink. Well, I didn't like yours, and it gets you this. Just a case of mistaken identity. And she wants me in a cup. Well, why didn't you stop her? Well, didn't stop her. The person last March didn't stop her, who am I to... Besides, she slaps too fast. Who is she? Roxie Reagan, she's billed as the Queen of Yukon. - Queen got a king? - Yeah, a king of spades. They ought to bury him with his own shovel. Listen to me, brother, that Roxie plays with a full deck. No room even for a joker? Not unless you wanna finish the game face down, in the discard. I'll take a chance. Oh, Roxie. Yes? How about having supper with me tonight, after your last number? Just to celebrate. Whose birthday is it this time, yours or George Washington's? Both, we were twins, you know. Not tonight, I've really got to go home. Not even for a little while? No, I've been neglecting John too much. Maybe that's why he's... But surely, you can't be in love with that drunkard? Look, Tom, you've been swell. I like working for you. But let's leave it at that, hmm? All right, if you say so. Ah, Gary, Gary Corbett. Petey, hi, boy am I glad to see you. Is that so? Well, why didn't you come straight to the old postmaster when you got here? Well, it was after store hours, so I figured I'd wait for you here. How bout something to eat? Come on, I could eat the hip of a horse. You probably will. Yeah, say Joe, bring us a couple of them porterhouse steaks, rare, flock of onions, golden brown stack of french fries, you know. Yes, sir, Postmaster. Come on Gary, let's go eat somethin', huh? Say, Pete, the letter I got was in your handwriting. Why didn't Pop write me himself? He couldn't spell fabulous. You mean the mine's that good? No, but if somebody doesn't take it away from ya, you and your old man don't have to worry from now on. Imagine Pops striking it rich after all these years. Well, nobody deserves it more than he does. Now don't go leaving yourself out, you old galute. Where would he be if you hadn't been staking him year after year? Well, I got faith in him, same as I got faith in Alaska. I hope you're gonna stay home for awhile now. Home is where the gold is. Not only gold, it's the land. Son, you better settle here and raise yourself a crop of good Americans. Say, do I see a peculiar glint in your elderly but active eyes? Yes, and if you'll listen carefully, you can hear me lickin' my chops. I'm the oldest fool on Roxie's list. - Hello, Pete. - Hello, darling. Roxy, I want you to meet Gary Corbett. Gary, shake hands with Roxie Reagan. You mind if I get acquainted with your left hand? I've already met your right. Ah, I'm terribly sorry, the bartender told me. I mistook Mr. Corbett for a drunk and slapped his face. Oh. You will forgive me, won't you? Oh, why yes, of course not. What I mean to say is, the pleasure was all mine. What's this all about? Won't you sit down? I, I, I really can't. Will you have supper with me? Oh, yes, I'd love to. Eh, what'll you have, Roxie? Just some scrambled eggs and coffee, waiter. Bring me the same, please. Well, I've read about this in books, but I never saw it in real life before. Goodness. Ah, what have we here? Forsooth, a canine. Art lonesome for thy master? Well, so am I for mine. Only mine wears a skirt. No? I wish that I had your wisdom, to scorn the cup that destroys. Romans, countrymen, and lovers. Hear me for my cause, and be silent! If there be any among you, any dear friend of Caesar's, to him I say, not that I love Roxie less, but that I love this more! Why, I was in San Francisco at the same time. No. Hey, Roxie, do you know the cigar store on Market Street, the one with the wooden Indian in front of it? With the dress store right next to it. Yeah, that's the one. To think that we might have met then. You going in for a cigar and me going in for a dress. Sorry to interrupt, but... Same as usual? A little worse, I'm afraid. Where in the world does he get it? I've asked everybody in town to help me straighten him out. Not here, none of my bartenders would give him anything. We're talking about my husband. Very charming gentleman, but a hopeless drinker, I'm afraid. I'll take him home. No, your number is on shortly. Nick and I will take him home. Thanks, Tom, you're very sweet. - Gary... - Yes, Mrs. Reagan? It's one of those difficult situations. I couldn't explain it in the first hour. I'm glad it explained itself in the first hour. You shouldn't leave your wedding ring at home, Mrs. Reagan. Without it, some darn fool might get some darn fool ideas. Bye. Gary. Well, so long, Pete. You're not gonna start for the mine tonight, are you? Yes, I always do things the hard way. Bye. Stop whistling, you drunkard. My peace is addled enough without that wail of a banshee. Maybe you better stop drinking. I have that in mind, my good innkeeper, when and if I choose. Now you think you could stop. Instantly, but not too suddenly. You did bring me some, didn't you? All right, let him have it. Ah. I'd ask you, gentlemen, to join me, but unfortunately, my wife is supposed to. If you tell her that I gave it to you, I'll wring your Shakespearean neck. You have my permission, sir. Well, you won't get another drop. That will be a far, far greater calamity. Good wine is a good familiar creature if well used. Exclaim no more against it. If I was crazy about a gal, I'd bend so she'd get a divorce. The trouble with Dr. Reagan is his marriage is for keeps. Yeah, but she don't love him. No, but she thinks he needs her. Listen, Leroux, suppose he kicks off? She would leave right away and she wouldn't come back. No, my best bet is to leave things as they are for the time being anyway. Roxie, Roxie, you're on. Pop, Pop! Let's get outta here. They won't get away with it, partner. Drop that gun, Corbett. Now come forward. Hello, Corbett. I'm John Masters, United States Marshal. I'm arresting you for murder. They're the murderers. They killed my father. Let's let the court worry about that. I'm taking you to Juno. Two names scratched, huh? We'll have to hang you twice. Good joke. I'll get the rest. That's the wrong attitude, Corbett. Now get your stuff. Gary Corbett, handcuffed. Pete, Pete! Pete, Pete! Huh? - Come here, hurry. - What's the matter? Come on, come on. What's the matter, son? What do you got him for, Marshal? Murder. What about it, Gary? Yeah, a bunch of claim jumpers murdered Pop, and I got a couple of them. Well, a man has got a right to protect his own property, hasn't he? You can't hold a man for that, Marshal. No, and he ain't goin' to. Come on now, Marshal, take off those irons. I'll take 'em off and put one on you if you don't get outta here. I'm telling you, you better take 'em off. Hold on, wait a minute, wait a minute here. What happens to him is up to a jury. I'm taking him to Juno. Now I don't want any trouble, but if you fellows want it, you'll get it. Wait a minute men, wait a minute. The marshal's right. Nobody wants to see that boy free more than I do. When they killed his dad, they killed one of the best friends I ever had. Now we gotta get Gary out of this. But we're gonna do it the American way, with law and order. Now you're talkin' sense, Pete. Now go on, scatter fellows, scatter, go ahead. Don't say nothin' to nobody now, Gary and we'll try and think what to do. Let's get somethin' to eat here in The Palace. I'll be over there and see you in a little while. Corbett, if you'd behave yourself I'll take these things off, at least until we've had something to eat. I'm going to square things my way. I'm wanna take the first chance I get to do it. Glad you warned me. Do we have to go in here? What's the matter with it? # Forget if you can # The moment we knew # Let memories fade # Of plans that we made that never came true # Forget if you can # My arms about you # Our favorite tune # Our favorite moon, or two # Forget if you will # The moment that will reveal every dream # Don't reminisce, don't think of the kiss # That sealed every dream # We couldn't pretend, so it came to an end # Before it began # So shouldn't we both # Forget if you can - Hello, Roxie. - Oh, please don't get up. - Hello, Gary. - Hello. - Won't you sit with us? - Just for a minute. I see you still don't like my act. I like it very much. You didn't applaud. What did you do? The marshal calls it murder. That's what the warrant calls it. Does he have to wear these things? He doesn't have to, Roxie. I offered to take 'em off if he'd give me his word, - but he refused to... - All right, Marshal, you have it. Well, tell me about it. There isn't much to tell. Bunch of claim jumpers killed my father and stole his mine. So far I've been able to get two of 'em. Who were they? - Madison and Holden. - Madison? Yes, did you know them? Well, only through Leroux. They were friends of his, you know? Hello, how are you? You know Mr. Corbett? Glad to see you again. Well, see you later. Roxie, why don't you stay and have supper with us? No, thanks, I'm having supper with Tom. Shall we eat in my dressing room? Great, I'll be up in a minute. Give me time to change. You know you're a funny girl. I am? Yes, first night in a year I haven't asked you to supper, and you ask me. Gal's entitled to a change of mind. And heart. I don't know, mine never seem to work together. I'm glad you took them things off him, Marshal. You know, I've been thinkin' about this epidemic of claim jumpin'. There's brains behind it, tight, smooth-workin' organization. We just found out that the two I shot were friends of Leroux's. - What? - Say Pete, what do you know about this Judge Bennett who signed the eviction notice? Well, you fellas are wastin' your time because those eviction notices are legal. Pete, you miners spend so much time lookin' for gold you forget the little matter of paying your assessment. Well, Pop paid his. Fine, that's good, where's your receipt? You show that to me and I'll, I'll chase those claim jumpers off so fast it'll make your head swim. Well, you didn't give me much time to look for it. Wouldn't done you any good, son, it isn't there. First thing them bandits go for. They not only rob and kill decent men, but they're makin' a joke out of the territory of Alaska. Look, Masters, if you'll give me few days free time, I bet I can find out who this Judge Bennett's working for. Then we'll know who really should be tried for murder. That's a good idea, only I can't give you free time. Why not? You can't get outta here for a couple of days yet. The Yukon's a roarin' flood, you can't get across till it settles down. Well, tell you what I'll do, Pete. How'd you like to be a deputy United States Marshal? I'm postmaster now. Well, we'll say just for a few days, and then, well, if Corbett here doesn't behave the government can take it out of your hide. All right, Marshal, you got yourself a deputy. Postmaster, U.S. deputy. Maybe I'll run for governor next, huh? Come in. Where's Mr. Leroux? He's still in his office, Mademoiselle. Thank you. I'll tell you, this man Corbett's a dangerous man to have running around loose. But he's not loose, sir, he's in Marshal Masters' custody. Well, Corbett has enough friends to take him away from 10 marshals once they get out of town and hit the Juno trail. Is there a reason why he should ever get to the Juno trail? Yes, I hear since the blizzard, the wolves and bears walk right into town these dark nights. And it's a public duty to shoot 'em down. Anybody can make a mistake. Shooting Corbett is one thing, you've gotta be jolly well careful if the marshal is with him. Oh, Roxie, Leroux said to tell you he'll be up in about 10 minutes. Thanks, Nick, where's the marshal? Over there. Oh, Marshal. Hello, Roxie, have a drink. Where's Gary? Oh, he just left, I hope he's not too far away. You let him go alone? He is all right. Not without you. You've got to go after him right away. Don't leave his side for a minute. Why? Because, because his life's in danger. What makes you think so? I, I can't tell you now, but he mustn't be left alone. Well, he's with Pete, they'll take care of themselves. They don't care how many of his friends they kill. He'd only be safe if you were with him, someone they didn't dare hurt. Well, I'll try to find him. No, no, don't stop, I'll walk along with you. You look like you had a drink with the devil. - What's the matter? - Oh, nothing. I wish women would stop saying, "Oh, nothing." Me too, when they say, "Oh, nothing," I'm off like a rocky mountain goat. I'll see you later. Oh, please don't go, I, I only want to say goodbye. To this fellow without a chaperone. Hey, Pete, Pete. Come on. What on earth's the matter with you? Nevermind, just keep walking. You shouldn't have come out on a cold night like this - in that thin dress. - I know it. Maybe you better turn back. I'm going home. Then you better put my coat on. No, don't stop. I don't wanna take a chance on hitting her. No, Tom would kill us. What's she doin' with him anyway? Had they rained all kinds of sores and shames on my bare head, steeped me in poverty to the very lips. Must be pretty tough goin'. At times. Someday people will realize that an alcoholic isn't a bad man. Make me the fixed figure of the time for scorn to point his slow and moving finger at. Yet could I bear that, too. I'm glad you like my performance, sir. Roxie, my dear, I present canine Rex, the king among dogs. Unheralded and unsung, he came to see my performance of Othello. Who's our other guest? This is Mr. Corbett, he owns the dog and... Congratulations, sir. My husband, Mr. Reagan. Congratulations, sir. I seem to have a rival for the dog's affection. You should, after all, the dog's his. I will avoid the obvious parallel. John, I'd like Mr. Corbett to stay here all night. Well, I'm, I'm staying with Pete. No, the dangerous part is getting back, you don't understand. I think I do, those men who were following us. Why take chances, what can you lose by staying? Yes, what can you lose? You might even gain, who knows what? John. Sir, how would you like to trade? Trade what? My wife for your dog. You're drunk. Of course, I'm drunk, that's why I'm speaking the truth. Have you never heard the old saying, in vino veritas? He understands, he's a remarkable quadruped. He even appreciates Shakespeare. My friend and critic. But that I am forbid to tell the secrets of my prison house. I could a tale unfold whose lightest word would harrow up thy soul. Freeze thy young blood, make thy two eyes like stars start from their spheres. Thy knotted and combined locks to part. And each particular hair to stand on end, Like quills upon the fearful porpentine. But this eternal blazon must not be to ears of flesh and blood. List, list, oh, list. If ever thy dear father thou didst love, revenge his foul and most unnatural murder. Murder most foul, as in the best it is. But this most foul, strange and unnatural. Seems even Shakespeare knew what was going on in Moose River. Thanks Roxie, goodnight. Gary, please don't. Stop worrying, we'll be all right, all of us. Come on, Dike. Come on, Dike. This is pretty tough going, John. I'm sorry. I made a mistake. I guess we all do. The worse mistake you ever made was to marry me. And then to run away with me when the law came yapping at my heals. Even now it's only through a misguided sense of loyalty. I don't think that loyalty is ever misguided. You love him, don't you? I'm trying very hard not to. You will see, Judge Bennett, that these are simple statements of fact. Proving that we did pay our assessments. Affidavits aren't proof. You're not trying this case, Judge. All we want you to do is certify our signatures and put that little red seal on it. Aren't you men being somewhat hasty about all this? You didn't hesitate to certify papers that threw us off of our property. Those evictions were perfectly legal. We'll let the high court in Juno decide that, Judge. Now young man, you know that won't do you any good. As a defendant in a murder charge, you have no standing in the civil court until the... Nevermind the speech, Bennett, all we want is your John Hancock. And you ain't got no right to refuse us, have ya? Oh no, it's perfectly legal, but it's a waste of time. There you are, men, that'll be $2 a piece. - $2? - What for? Well, you're a public officer, ain't you? It's the regular recorder's fee. It's... Perfectly legal. Hi, boys. See, now you've offended me, Marshall. You've got my word, haven't you? Have you changed your mind? No, not at all, I just wanted you to know that the trail is open, Corbett, and we're leaving first thing in the morning. I thought you'd like to know as soon as possible. Who's that? Jones and Bailey. They must've kicked something in the dark. Better go down and keep 'em quiet. Well, I hope you find something that'll do us some good. That does it. # You can't forget the menu at the Poker and Waltz # For they're the nicest dancers that I know # But don't forget the menu at the Poker and Waltz # Our dances are that cannot do alone # But if you can, can, can # You're not a # Just imitate the kangaroo # You get your pose about # Just all your woes about # Like the fellow that followed you # Show your knees and dimples please # A bit of this you'll never miss # For if you can, can, can # Then you can plant your man # And maybe he can, can, can too Certainly has a nice of girls up there. Yeah, you sure have got an eye for the girls, Tyler, huh? How'd you get here so quick, Judge? What do you mean, I've been here for two hours. Now wait a minute, I just seen you movin' around your office. You what? At least, I thought it was you. The blind was down, but there was a light. Is somebody tryin' to get something on you, Judge? That's not funny, come on. Wait a minute, we better see Tom first, huh? Yeah, the boss'll wanna know about this. Yeah. Yes, it's Corbett all right, there's no doubt about it. Pick up your boys and get over there as fast as you can. But no shooting. - Why not? - What for? Pin a burglary charge on 'em. Let's see what happens when Corbett takes his case to Juno. Yes, that's the way to do it, I never thought of that. Uh, should Carter and I go along? By all means. Two outstanding citizens for witness, - it will make it per... - Yes, perfectly legal. Wasn't that what you were about to say? Well come on boys, let's get started. See you later, Leroux. Well, we might've known Bennett wouldn't leave anything important here in the office. - Oh, but he has. - Did you find something? Come on, let's go. Wait a minute. We don't wanna be caught in here. They're on the way over. We'll hide in the shadows. When they come close, we'll jump 'em. You two hide around there. The light's not on. I wonder if they're still inside. Let's find out. What, hey, hey. Help, help! Help! Help! Hey, now where do we get them? Help! Hey, somebody's fighting here. I wonder what it's all about. How many pounds of coffee do you want? You better make it a couple, Pete. Two. Look, Marshal, there was a, there was somethin' I wanted to ask you, I... Yes, I know what you want Pete, but I can't do it. I've overdue in Juno now as it is. - Oh. - Got any beans up there? Yeah. And some salmon too, Pete. There's your beans. Say, Marshal, Gary's got a little hunch he wants to follow up, but he needs a little time on it... How'd last night's hunch work out? Huh? Come on now, Pete, you know you're legally my deputy. Legally, right now I'm sellin' salmon. Where'd you get that cut? You mean this little scratch on my face? Yeah, and don't tell me you got it shaving. Well, no. I had a little bit too much to drink last night and I come in here to light the lamp and I fell against the counter. Sure you didn't get it outside Judge Bennett's office last night? What happened there? Well, it seems like a bunch of fellas broke into his office last night and turned it upside down lookin' for somethin'. My goodness, where were you? I was away. So the prima absent evidence, eh? Here's your salmon, anything else? No, this oughta do it. You about ready, Corbett? I'll be packed in a minute. Now, how much do I owe you? Let's see, get your hands outta the raisins. Two hard pack. Listen, Marshal, give that boy a couple of days more. - Can't do it. - Just one day then. Not for his sake, not for my sake, but for the sake of the justice you're suppose to represent in this great territory of Alaska. Ah, Tratchall I'd beat you a run for congressional delegate. Can you do it? One day, and it's as much as my badge is worth. I could kiss you for that. Here have so more raisins, go on, take 'em all. Hello, Pete. Come in. Hello. You shouldn't have come here. I heard you were leaving this morning and I couldn't let you go without at least saying goodbye. I'll be here for another day. Let me fix that breakfast. Are you a good cook? You'll know in a minute. Where are the eggs? Over there. Bacon? I'll get it. Gary. - Yes? - I... How do you like your bacon? With egg. I wish you didn't have to go, alone. Oh, I won't be alone. The United States is providing me with a paid companion. Let me go with you. Why, Mrs. Reagan? Don't you think it's time I did something about my life? Well, sure. Don't let your heart run away with your tongue, Mr. Corbett. You say such exciting things as, "Oh, sure." You'll turn a poor girl's head, make her think you're as interested in what happens to her as you are in, in breakfast. What are you trying to do, burn up the place? I'll tell you boss, the whole town is talkin' about it. Get Bennett, take him. Right, boss. - Mr. Leroux. - What is it? I've received a letter from England. Yeah, tell me about it later. But it's quite important. I said, never mind. At last, give it to me. You know where Roxie is? Rehearsing, I suppose. That's right, rehearsing a love scene with a new leading man, Gary Corbett. It's a lie, you're lying your teeth, you wretched barkeep. Let's go. Oh, please don't, you've got to let me have a drink. Barkeep can't leave if I give him a way to stop. Oh, I didn't mean that, I apologize. Apologies won't pay your bill. I'll pay you, I'll get it from Roxie, some way. Suppose Roxie's not here? Suppose Roxie goes away with Corbett? Oh, she wouldn't. You can make sure that she doesn't. I've committed many sins in my life, but not murder. Wouldn't be murder to defend your home. No jury would convict you. And every man in Alaska would honor you. Yes, even applaud you. Why do you want this man dead? Well, I got my reasons, but not as strong as yours. Well, what about it? I could think better if I had a drink. Reagan, here's a chance for you to play a better part in real life, than you ever did on the stage. Give me a drink. You'd solve all the problems. You could swim in a river of whiskey for the rest of your life. Well what do you say, yes or no? I can't think. What kind of a man are you not to defend the honor of your wife? Mr. Leroux, you are mistaken. I may not be like Caesar, but my wife is like Caesar's wife, above suspicion. Good day, sir. You had a good chance of getting Corbett last night. Instead of that, what did you do? Start fighting each other. - Well, it was dark and... - Couldn't see a thing. Yes? - Oh, hello, Marshal. - Hello, Tom. Big time last night, huh? - Yes, we had, uh... - We sure, now listen here, Marshal, we, respected citizens of Moose River resent a murderer runnin' around loose on our street. And after all, Marshal, a prisoner in Judge Bennett's jurisdiction should be in his custody. That's right. Is the Corbett mine located in Moose River? Just outside. Well then, as long as your city limits don't extend to the scene of the crime, he's still my prisoner, isn't he? What about the crime he committed last night, breaking into my office? That's Moose River, isn't it? Sure, but can you prove he did it? Yes, Tobin and I can identify... What, with those blinkers? Boys, you'll have to think up somethin' smarter than that. So long. Well, what do we do now? I think somethin' oughta be done about Reagan. What about Reagan? I heard him yellin' about what we'd done to old Corbett. Something about, if you ever had any use for your old man, kill the boys who done him in. "Murder, darn foul," he called it. What? Now, now, old boy, he was merely quoting Shakespeare, don't you know? Well, if this guy Shakespeare's in it, then let's get him, too. Yes, we, huh? - Corbett's here. - Alone? No, the whole shootin' match is with him. Oh, get out. And see it doesn't become a real shooting match, not in my place. See you later. Well, Bennett, looks like we got saddled with a bunch of fools. Seriously, Tom, what are we gonna do? Take it easy, I'll think of something. Stumpy. Yes, sir. You know, it's too bad that you haven't got the body to match your brains. I'm so sorry sir, but I feel I must withdraw even the little I've had to contribute. What do you mean? I've been trying to tell you all day, sir. I received a letter from England. The family has squared things with the authorities, I can go home. How soon do you expect to leave? In the morning, sir. I shall accompany Marshal Masters and his prisoner to Juno, and go home from there. There, I've been putting my papers in order to make it easier for my successor. Will you just sign those sir, and. How much of a family have you got? Oh, I've got an old mother, an older brother and three sisters. The youngest is about 18, and they're all lovely, every one of them. And they're fond of me too, in spite of, in spite of everything. Excuse me running on like this sir but, you can imagine how anxious I am to see 'em all. I understand you. Stumpy, have you got any money? Just enough for my passage, but I don't care. But you should care. Man coming from the gold country, you know, people expect gold pouring out of his ears. Well, we, we can't all strike it rich, sir. Oh, but you could. What did you say, sir? You heard me right. You may take home as much as $10,000. 10,000... Uh, no sir, I'm a very poor shot, sir. No, I don't expect you to kill anybody. Sit down here, I'll tell you what to do. Come on Nick, let's have a little service here. Hey, you're havin' quite a party, ain't you Postmaster? Yep, farewell party. Young Corbett man's leavin' for Juno, first thing in the morning. I'll be back before you know it, you old snow bear, you. You're sure they won't convict you of that murder, huh? They won't convict him of nothin' when they hear what he knows. What'll it be, boys? Little rum and gum, please. - Whiskey for me. - Bourbon. I wish I could be in Juno when the judge gets a load of what Gary's got to tell. So you've got the evidence you were lookin' for, Corbett? Enough, I think. Good, now you just hand it over to me and it'll make it official. Well, thanks Marshal but I, I haven't written it down yet. I'm carrying it around in my head for safe keeping. Would you have a little touch, Marshal? Sure, bourbon. Well, a safe return to you, son. Hurry back. Why don't you watch what you're doing? Sorry. Why don't you leave me alone? Now take it easy fella, I think you've had a few too many. That's an insult, take it back. Hey, what's the matter with you, Stumpy? Man, you're loco. Take your hands off me. Are you gonna apologize or not? Well, I don't know what there is to apologize for, but if you want it, you've got it. Well, you'll laugh at me, would ya? You think I can't fight, huh? Well... Now, now, now, now, hold on. You better go someplace and sleep this off. Who hit him? He did. He had it comin' to him. That's no excuse for hitting a man like that. Take the little fellow into my office. Fine thing to hit a man like Stumpy. Put him down here in the chair. He'll be all right. Yeah, it's only a bump. Well, what are you staring at? Nothing, boss. Corbett hit the poor little Stumpy so hard that it killed him, understand? Now get out and spread the news. And don't let him get away. - Stumpy is dead, boys. - What? That's right, he just died in the office. What kind of a lug is it that would slug a man like Stumpy? Boys! Boys, please, boys. Boys, you all knew poor Stumpy. You know why this inoffensive little man was standing at the bar? He was celebratin', celebratin' his last stay in Alaska, for tomorrow, he was goin' home to his poor old mother. And now, he lies dead in there. Stumpy's been killed, and they say Gary Corbett did it. I don't believe it. What are they doing to him? Nothing yet. - Take it easy, take it easy. - Give the man a chance. What chance did he give poor little Stumpy? Yeah! I told you Stumpy started it. You all saw it. Yes, he was drunk. That any excuse for murder? Why, Corbett's no murderer. No, why is the marshal taking him to Juno, for a tea party? Yeah! You've gotta stop this, Tom. How can I? Well, you can't let them kill him. Does it really mean that much to you? Yes, it does. You made a deal. Men, will you listen to me. Stumpy was my employee, but he was also my friend. And I assure you that I am as interested as you are to see the murderer punished for his crime. Let's lynch him, boys! Be quite. But there is no reason why we shouldn't do this in a civilized manner. There's nothing uncivilized about a hangin'. Quiet, listen. We have law and order in this town, and we are going to do it in a legal manner, and after a proper trial. As judge of Moose River, I order you to disperse. Quiet. Judge Bennett will take charge of the prisoner, and he will be perfectly safe in our jail till we can give him a fair trial. Everything's gonna be done. Only gonna let them put him in jail here, aye? No, might be a good idea for you. You'd be safer there than you would in my custody. At least tonight, you will. This time, Marshal, he's my prisoner. I just wanna warn you, Judge, that jail better be lynch-proof to catch on. I know you didn't do it, Gary. Thanks, Roxie. Come on. Tom. I wanna thank you what you've done. I thought there's more than a mere polite thank you involved, wasn't there? I didn't understand you to mean... We made a deal. Your friend is safe in jail, isn't he? Yes. You think there's nothing to stop us? We can leave tonight. And don't pack. We can buy everything and anything you want in San Francisco. I see you expect me to keep my end of your deal. Well, look, come on. Fun idea. Just got some news for you. Yes? Corbett's friends are planning to break him out of jail sometime tonight. You want us to? No, you are much too fidgety with your shooting arrows. Besides, they will never get him out. But suppose they do get him out? Don't worry, they won't. And this time it's gonna be an accident. This time, it'd be done in jail. - There's fire there. - See it. Hey, where's the fire? Hey, somebody let us out! Let us out. The jail's on fire. Hey, open up. Let us out. Hey, somebody open up. Let us out! Hey. Please, you gotta let him out of there. I would, take it easy, darlin'. We're doing the best we can over there. But you can't go in there. Why? Go help him! Who has the key to the cell? Here it is but... Let me have it. John. John! Help! Let us out. Hurry! Move it! Move it! Move it! Move it! Gary, Gary, thank heaven, you're safe. Men, don't stand there trying to save the jail. Save the rest of the town. Get out, everybody get out. Fire spreading to this place. Come on, get out. No, don't waste it. I hope the devil's generous with his. I should like to be met with a drink. Don't talk, dear. Dear? It's been a long time. All my fault, I know. Now maybe I can answer that old problem. To be or not to be, that is the question: whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings and arrows of outrageous fortune, or to take arms against a sea of troubles, and by opposing, end them. To die, to sleep, no more. To sleep, perchance to dream. To dream. Gary, we just found out that Leroux's the man behind this whole thing. The court clerk back of the jail made him talk. Leroux? Let him go, he can find his own debts. I'm certainly glad that you got out. I was smoked out by your friends. My friends? I don't understand what you mean. Leroux, I want you to tell me who was with you in this scheme of robbery and murder. Not really. I suppose the next thing, you're going to ask me to sit down and write you a letter about it... What's strong and Leroux, who are they? No, don't. Why, are you going to talk? All right, I'll talk. Well, go ahead. I'm not the head man. I'm only telling you. - I told... - For whom? You may yet find out. Thanks, Marshal. I wasn't in trouble. You are now. He meant you? Well, you didn't think that he had brains enough to organize a plan, did you? A very good plan, if I do say so myself. But he only fronted for me until, like you, he fell in love and lost his head. Speaking of losing heads, I'm sorry I have to blow your resolve. I won't let you suffer, I'll aim through. I like you, Corbett. Oh, before I die, there are a few things I'd like to know. Say it, mate. Make it quick. Tom, if you're behind all this, why did you bother to arrest me? Why didn't you just snuff me out? That's a fair question. I'll answer it, really. Meanwhile, pack the gold dust in that leather pouch, for me. I let you live for the same reason I took those handcuffs off. I wanted to find out just what evidence you could collect. I was gonna get it all from you on the trail after a little accident I planned for you. But when you told me that the evidence was not in your pocket, but in the head, that put me on the spot, Corbett. I had to find some other way to get the truth out of you. This fool upset everything by being too impatient. He wanted his share now, so he had to die. Sorry, Corbett. Get up quick, Marshal. It's gonna get a little warm in here. Finish our little chat if you were gonna join with us. How would you kids like to go of Frisco when we get there and have dinner with me, huh? You know, I guess you wouldn't. Imagine, he has a gold mine in Alaska and they gotta go all the way to San Francisco to dig up a little gold band for a finger. Beautiful any day. Kinda hate to leave it for a crowded little town like Washington, D.C. but they sent me to congress. Well, leave. And I've got something to tell those congressmen in the whole country. I'm going to make them see that gold is not the only important thing in Alaska. Gold is just a decoy. Come on. Old dame nature's way of getting the right kind of people here; rugged, solid people like Gary here, men who'll change the whole fate of Alaska and fill it into pig sty for the plague. They can't stop a stake. We're America.
