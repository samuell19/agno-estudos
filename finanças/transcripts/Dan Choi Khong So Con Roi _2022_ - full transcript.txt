Have you remembered how to get the leech off? Yes, Dad! Hey, hold it. Dad, but I'm scared. Hold it! To my dad, the only way to overcome fears is to confront them. My way is way simpler. As long as I am next to a woman, all my fears will just vanish. Don't you know? Since we met, my head has kept aching terribly. What happened, honey? Because you have been running around my mind. I can't stop thinking of you. How can I not get headaches? That's naughty of you! I have never let anyone do that to me. Do what? Sleep in my heart. Gia Linh! Don't you know this world is full of temptations? I know, honey. That's why you are my only safe harbor. Land on me now, babe. But there is a fear that keeps chasing me. That is... my fear of heights. What's wrong with you? Do you dare to jump off for me? Jump. - Dad. - Jump. I'm scared. Jump. Dad, I'm scared. - Jump! - I'm scared. Daddy, Daddy. Gosh, how could you sleep like that, Lan? You dare to ask me? What? This is the 21st time this month you kick me off the bed. Have I slept over at your place 21 days this month? That's a lot. - What do you mean? - Not that. I mean, 21 times are quite a lot. That's it? Go away! Lan? Hey, baby. When I come over tonight, don't throw me out like last time. Don't be mad at me. I will make it up for you tonight. Bye, baby! Love you. GL? Who is GL? Oh my God. GL? Probably wrong number again! MRS. GIAO THAM 9999 Lai. What salted fish do you want to buy? What's this? This is big Sesarmidae. And what's that? Don't you know how to read? I don't know how to read. I only know you. So do you want to try it?

Bro, help me chase after that motorbike please! Are you crazy? How can I catch them with my cyclo? Bro! I can. - How can he catch up? - Hurry up man! This way. Why are you signaling with your arm? I have to follow the rules. - Turn! Turn! - Don't push me! Speed up! - Turn left. - No, we cannot! The Cambodian border is nearby. I need to grab my passport at home. Oh gosh! Just catch them before reaching the border. - Hurry up, please! - Are you sure? - Faster. - Linh. - Linh. Why did you leave the baby with me? - Speed up, please! Your wife left you? I dumped her a long time ago. - Now she leaves me with this baby. - Speed up. - Come on. - Okay, okay. Faster, bro! What happened? - What happened? - We've run out of gas! Gosh! How could a driver let his own vehicle run out of gas? - Hey. - What now? To cool your head down. You are so nosy. Hurry up! I really hate a playboy who was dumped by his wife. Figure it out yourself, man! Hey! Didn't he say he ran out of gas? Hey, Linh? What are you doing? Quan, she is our daughter. - Please help me raise her. - No! Linh, I can't! I'm sorry. Hello? Hello? Hey there. Hi, my name is Tha May. Can you please give me a ride? Go! Tha May, "I have a rattle toy. Is the chubby guy home?" Yes, he is! Can you speed up, May? We have a baby onboard. If you slow down, we will lose sight of the mom of this baby, May. What's up, May? May, can we speed up? Right! We're in hurry! Definitely! If we lose sight of her, this baby will become an orphan, May! - Help me, please! - Okay, I'll help you. Come on, May! Speed up! May! How can we catch them at this speed? Don't worry! This is the shortcut to the border gate. Seems like our fate together ends here. Hope that you will find a new stroke of fate in 300 meters. Wait! Thank you so much, bro! All roads lead to Rome! Wish you success! Here you go. Thank you! Hey! Linh! ‪TINH BIEN INTERNATIONAL BORDER Where are you going? Can you please let me in? Where is your passport? I was in a hurry, so I left my passport at home. If you didn't bring your passport, please step aside! Can you please do me a favor? Pass this baby to the lady running over there! Am I joking with you? Get out please! Oh my God! Why does nobody love me? Linh! Linh! Quan? - Tam? - Hey, it's me. This is the only way you can catch up with the mother. If you enter the city, you can never find her. Are you sure? Don't worry! I swear it will work. Get off. Have we arrived yet, Sneaky Tam? Almost there. You said that a million times. Are you sure? Gosh, I beg you. Don't let her cry. We will all get caught if she keeps crying. Beg her, not me! That's your baby. You do it. She won't stop. Soothe her, man. Come on, stop crying! We will find you milk once we get there. Are we there yet? Almost there! We'll reach there at the end of this path. Hop on, hop on. Get off, get off. What's going on? - What should we do now? - Run away! Hey, Sneaky Tam! Yes, Mr. Tin? Mr. Tin, I just wanted to help my friend. His baby is still too little, her mom has just left them, and he can't afford to raise the child by himself. It's all your fault! I told you! Bring your papers along, then I would give you a ride. Why did you drag me into these... We are violating the law! - Sneaky Tam! - Yes, sir! I have already verified your case. We have printed out the photos of the baby's mother and have started searching for her. Sign this form and go home. Don't do anything reckless again! This is the border area. - We don't allow illegal trespassing. - I understand! Why did you tell me we would succeed? So that's it. That's what? You told me it was guaranteed. You didn't have any papers, so I had to take that path. Stop! Stop! Pull over here! Damn it! Pull over here for what? What? Ugh! So stinky! Help me out! Oh, the baby just pooped. Just change the diaper. That's easy. I don't know how to do that. Hey, hey. Please help me. I can't take it. You suck! I want to throw up so bad! I have never seen a father like you. Take this off for me. You have to take off this part first. - What's that? - Lower your head so you can take it off Gosh, I'm gonna die! Okay, there you go. What a little girl! Pass me the new diaper. What are you staring at? Come on! Good girl! If my wife Tu were here, she would take you home with her. Which one is the diaper? You don't even know what a diaper looks like? I really don't. You're the worst, man! Is that really a girl? Is she even your daughter? I just found out about her. That's okay. Okay, all done! You'll come back to your father, little cutie. Hold her carefully. I will drive. Hold on! Why do you act like you want to avoid her? You're such an irresponsible father! - What's that? - From your baby. Oh my God, it's disgusting. Why do you smear that on me? Now go home, get the documents then stay overnight at my house. I will take you tomorrow morning. Dad, I want to hold the baby! Little Princess. Just stay away! You don't know anything. Stay away! I know. - Little Princess. - Giau, Sang, Toi, Roi. Help me prepare water to bathe the baby. Go, go. Quick. Let's get ready. You should go take a shower too. You are dirty from working all day. Don't carry her like that and make her cry! - May I hold her a bit more? - Take a shower now! Hello, Uncle Hai. It's me, Quan. Do you know where Linh is? I would like to apologize to her. Hello, hello? Here you are, Mom. I will give you a bath, little cutie! Put that pillow down there for me. Here is the towel, Mom. Okay, let me handle this. Lay her down here. How cute! Drink first. I will drive you around to look for her tomorrow. What if we can't find her again tomorrow? We will do it again the day after. What if we still can't find her then? Then a whole month. We'll find her anyway. If we can't find her after a month, it's definitely your karma. How could you be such a playboy? Stop dwelling on my past, please! Let's drink. My house is close to the border. You both should stay here. Share the food cost with us. That's all. - Is this all you have? - Yeah, that's all I have. Just keep it! When you collect more, you can share the cost with us later. This amount is nothing, man! Okay, give it to me! I'll keep it to buy milk for your daughter. You don't have any experience in raising a child anyway. Don't take her around. It won't be good for her health. Leave her here. We'll give you a hand. My wife is right. Tam, you sound so drunk now. Go inside and sleep. You'll leave early tomorrow. She took our booze! Yeah! Why didn't you say anything? Every house needs a roof. - Right. - She is the roof. What can I say? You are pretty incredible! How could you earn enough money for five to six members in your family? It's all from my wife. She trades anything she can and is also the agent for actors in this area. What does that mean? It means whenever film crews need local extras, my wife will organize them. Spare me a little of your drink. It's been a while since I could drink like this. Tam, bedtime! Your mother is calling you! Okay, you should also go to bed soon. I will give you a ride tomorrow. I wish that we had a baby sister like her, Mom! No, this is Uncle Quan's daughter. I wonder what her name is. She looks like a little bunny. Her name must be Bunny. How could her name be Bunny? It's so silly! Giau, Sang, Toi, Roi! Yes, Mom. Giau, Sang, come share the bed with your dad. Toi, Roi, you guys come sleep with me. Let Uncle Quan and the baby stay in the attic. Yes, Mom. Let's go. - Good night, Uncle Quan. - Good night, kiddos! Uncle Quan, what's your baby's name? Bunny. See? I told you. Her name is Bunny. Believe me. See. Here's yours. Have you seen this lady? No, I haven't. Have you seen this lady? Thank you, Uncle! INTERNATIONAL BORDER Have you seen this lady? Still haven't found her? So Bunny can stay longer with Momma Tu. Are you that happy? You went a little too far. - Who are you talking about? - You. Are you happy that she won't have a mom? Why are you laughing? Gosh. If you weren't here, I would have kicked your dad's ass. Don't you dare come here! Everyone in the village knows that you have an illegitimate child now. Go away. KIM PHUONG JEWELRY Quan, you even visit Buddhist temples now? Everyone has to deal with their own fate and karma. One should live without thoughts, without sorrows in this world. You really want to get rid of her? I stopped working this whole month to take you to look for her mom. I thought you had changed your mind. How could you think of leaving her at the temple? What should I do then? Raise her? I don't even know whether she is my daughter or is from another of Linh's love affairs and she just put the responsibility on me. Don't you see? Since the first day she was here, I couldn't even go out. So you think she is not your child? Do you dare swear that you didn't sleep with Linh? Do you dare swear that Bunny is not your child? Do you? Now you don't want to raise her, do you? We'll take care of her! Okay. Let's do that. Your mom left you, but did your dad abandon you? How can you abandon her now? Don't you find it cruel? We will adopt her. When she grows up, if you ever want to take her back, I will break your legs. Your mom left you, but did your dad abandon you? Why do you want to abandon her now? Dad. Dad, what can I do? I'm scared. Skinny Tu, we have another princess! What? Quan gave little Bunny to us, darling! - Really? - Right. Oh, Mommy's treasure. - Thank you, Quan! - What are you doing? So graceless. Why are you so happy when he scolded your wife? Who's happy? I'm so sad. So, so, so sad. ‪FOR SALE How much does this cost, Nam? That scooter is brand new, and it's expensive. You can't afford it. - How about this one? - You can't ride it. - Why not? - It's broken. How will you ride it? Why do you keep a broken one here? I'll take this one. I'm surprised you knew what to choose. I just pick what I am used to. Now you have a scooter, focus on working please. I will introduce you to some transport brokers so you can work to cover Bunny's expenses. Hey, Skinny Tu. - Yes, I'm here. - Are the farmers ready? Get them on set. We're out of time. Okay, I got it! We are ready. Giau, Giau! Come here. Help me hold the baby. Yes, Mom. Hey, why haven't you come inside? Why are you standing out here? The door is locked Oh, I forgot. My wife and Giau are on the film set today. So the kids and Bunny are out there, aren't they? No, they are at school. Bunny might be on the filming set. When a film crew comes here, my skinny wife will call everyone in this village to perform as extras. So why did she bring Bunny with her? Stop that wagon! - What's happen? - Honey! Giau and Bunny are on that wagon. The horse is running away. - Oh gosh. - Move quickly. Chase the horse. Quick. Hurry up. What? I haven't said "Action!" Hurry, hurry. Giau. Bunny. - Step aside. Move. - Move. Out of the way. Hurry up, Tam! Quick! Stay out of the way. Quickly. Hurry! Faster! Come here. Come over here. - Be careful, Quan. - Hurry. - Be careful, Quan. - Slower! Okay, okay. How's it going? Where are the kids? - Where is Bunny? - She is here... - No, she's not. - What? Mom, Mom. What are you doing, Giau? I was taking a pee. Gosh. How could I give the baby to you? Sorry, Quan. What's wrong with the horse? I don't know. I don't know how to explain it to the acting director. Mr... Mr. Tuan. I am sorry, Mr. Tuan. Why? Why hasn't the camera started? - But... - What? He has modern style, sir. - We are filming a historical movie... - His acting skills were phenomenal! But... but... we are filming a historical movie. Ouch! I can zoom in. I will zoom in on his closeup shots. Why? Why didn't you turn the camera on? Shut up! Go over there. Find him for me. I want him to be a stuntman for the movie. He must be here tomorrow and shoot this scene for me. - What do you want? - But... but... - Please accept this. - Sure, sure. - Quan, Quan. - I have a great deal for you. Hey, Quan. We were lucky that Giau knew how to look after a baby. Who knows what could have happened? - I... - You are just so careless as usual. I apologized to you. I didn't want it to happen either. Oh my God. Oh bro. I can't believe that you have stayed in her house and yell at her as if you were her mom. Right. This look, this face. Bro, I swear there is no other actor in Vietnam that looks like you. Tomorrow... can you spare your time helping me with one more scene? No acting at all. - Quan, Quan, Quan. - Quan. Gosh, he asked you to act in a movie. He didn't ask you to rob somebody. Why are you like that? - This comes with money. - I don't need money. Gosh, you are dirt poor. Drop the act. You don't need money, but Bunny needs food to survive. Only one scene can provide you the same as a whole month driving that scooter. That's right. Opportunities don't knock twice. Stop! How much? Here you go. What? That much? Easy job, man. One million for half an hour. - Really? One million for half an hour? - Yes. So how about Bunny? Skinny Tu can take care of her. No, no, no. I can't. Don't mention Skinny Tu. She will cry, see? She is startled when hearing about Skinny Tu. I also have this pretty good lady. She had four children. She just got a divorce. Stylist! - I'm here! I'm coming, I'm coming. - Hurry. - What? What? - Help me look after the baby, so he can shoot for the scene. That's it. I'm in charge of costumes, not a maid for this film crew. They should have known better. Why do I have to do everything? Oh sweet little baby. I'm here, I'm here. I'm holding you. Oh yes, love you, love you. I love babies, Mr. Tuan. Yes, sir. - Let's hang out. - Is that okay? Absolutely. Super professional. Hello, I am the film director. You look very cinematic. Action! Cut! What's that? Who are you after, guys? Tell him not to laugh. Run, chase. Oh God. Again. Get ready. Action! Cut! I stepped on my costume. Again! Again! Again! Cut! Cut! Sorry, sorry. Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Cut! Stop! Cut! Cut! - Sir... sir... I... - What's up with you? What? That actor. How many times? How can we fail in such a simple scene? What happened? You hired the guy yesterday. - Who allowed you to hire him? - I don't... I didn't approve it, so who asked you to hire him? You told me to hire him yesterday Oh? So that was him? Yes, it was him. So there is still one more chance. Listen carefully. Go over there. Teach him the right way. Tell him to act exactly the way he did yesterday. Got it? Otherwise, you won't get paid for this movie. You hear me? Got it? I am not a pro. Why do they force me to do it over and over again? Gosh, it's one million. It's not small money, right? I was told that this job took 30 minutes. Why did they ask me to do so much? Not only that. That guy scolded me. Quan! Run! Hey, hey, hey. Hey! Bunny! Bunny! Wonderful! Exceptional! Sir... that was a great shot. Why? Why? Why did you joke around with a child's life? I'm sorry, but... I just wanted the scene to look real. I'm not insane to play with a child's life. You see? This is a doll. Hey, please, calm down. It was my fault and also my wife's fault. We are sorry. We just wanted to help you act. We are sorry. All right, here you are. Thank you. Here is your money. TINH BIEN INTERNATIONAL BORDER Have you just moved here? Yes. Is that your daughter? No. That's my daughter-in-law. Oh, okay. I see. - There he goes again. - Uncle Quan, where should I leave this? Bring it inside. Looking for gals already. Where can I put this? Bring it inside. Mom will take care of it. Let your mom arrange that later. Oh dear, don't run around. Skinny Tu, can you help me arrange this? Okay. Hello, ma'am. Yes. Did you run out of options? Why did you rent this place? It's cheap. I'll save money to get the old one back. Help. Help me. Kids, come help your dad. Oh, Dad, leave it to me. It's okay. Come inside, come inside. You acted as if it's so heavy. This TV... It was for my dad before. Now he passed away. I brought it over for you. Gosh, then why are you so aggressive? I don't watch TV. Only Bunny. You think you can watch TV without her here? Right, sweetie? Hey, that's my shirt. Why did you wear it? Quan, do you want anything from the market? - Can you help buy me a fish, ma'am? - Okay. Thanks, ma'am. Dad, let's go to bed. Why is my shirt on you? I like it, because it smells so good. Smells good? Let's sleep. Don't complain later if I ever wear your clothes. Here, you can lie down here, Dad. Have you brushed your teeth? Nobody did it for me, Dad. How could you say so? You are not a baby anymore. How can't you brush your teeth? One. Two. Three. Go brush your teeth. You are a big girl now. Brush your teeth by yourself. Yes, that's right. Take your toothbrush. That's soap. Gosh. Why did you light the candles? You know, it's dark here. Right. I lit the candles to find the way into your heart. Oh, you grow on me. How can a woman resist you? Hey, that's the candle for ceremonial offerings. Where are the incense sticks? Why do we need them? For ceremonial offerings. You are so funny. I bought this candle to support your mom's business. I know your family sells joss papers, so I bought ceremonial candles. How could you even know that? You cooked all my favorite dishes. But we shouldn't eat dinner. We should taste each other. Oh honey, I am melting. Is this your bed? Dad! What? Oh my goodness. What is this? Why didn't you tell me you have a kid? You even have such a haggard wife. She is not my wife. She is my friend's wife. Oh my God, you can't even spare your friend's wife. Hey, I'm not that kind of woman. I only look after his daughter. You are pretty, but your mouth isn't. Hey, so what? How dare you. How dare you lie to me. From now on, don't expect my shop will sell you joss papers for any ceremonial days. Hue! Hey, Hue! Hey, Skinny Tu! Hey, I told Sneaky Tam to let her sleep over there with you. Why did you bring her here? She doesn't want to sleep there. Why can't you, little lady? I can't sleep without your shirt. Your shirt smells good. Damn it. Hit it! Oh yes, we have a loser. Dad, my favorite uncle passed out. I will pass out like him, too. Are you trying to scare me? I dare you to pass out. Hey, don't you want to eat? Are you making a fuss? Hey, wake up! Wake up! Wake up! Gosh, who on Earth smiles while fainting? I will count to ten. If you don't open your eyes, you will get in trouble. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. I tricked you. Gosh, you tricked me. You dare trick me again, and I won't bring you along anymore. Can you? You can't just go by yourself, Dad. I have to come watch you. Come watch me or come to eat snacks? I'm going broke paying for your snacks. - So are you coming? - Yes, sir. - Go get changed. Let's go. - Yes, sir. Hop on. I'm going now. Bye-bye. Here. You are so cute. You look so cute serving the sticky rice. - You're naughty. - How much? It's fine. Go. No, she won't accept that. Take it. - Five thousand, right? - Right. She is little but very stubborn. I don't like you flirting with ladies. Hey, little oldie, be less obnoxious. I have to keep you for my mom. What? Who asked you to? Dad, you have been tying my hair the whole day already. Done! Which role are you taking in this movie? That will be a pretty impressive one. This scene is simple. You just need to stand on the bridge, nurture your thoughts, feel the Eastern breezes. Then you jump in the river. After that, you get three million. You talk about it like it's a piece of cake. And this look. You have a passionate look for art. You crave for devotion. You crave for jumping. Geeze, stop! Cut it out, man! It's the same line that you spoke when you were just an assistant and forced me to jump on that horse carriage. Now you are a deputy film director, and you use the same line to convince me to jump off the bridge. Then when you become a director, am I going to jump off the building? Dad, are you afraid of heights? Dad, look at me to ease your fears! I will get even more scared looking at you. Dad, you are Superman! Show me your power! Dad, you are number one! Get going! Superman flies up to the sky, but they told me to jump off the bridge. - Bro... - Dad, do it! Okay, okay, I will jump. - Can I have 30 seconds to calm down? - Yeah! Sounding team, lighting team, get in place. Camera, set! "Young girl jumps off the bridge" scene. Dad, you can do it! Actor, standby! Sir, action! Action! You got this! You got this! You got this! You got this! Dad, Dad, look at me! Bunny! - Cut! Wonderful! - Yes! Bring her a towel. Quick, quick. Oh gosh, wipe her off. Bro, bro. Why? Why did you use Bunny to get me? Why? No, I didn't. She told me to. Who told you to do that? Bunny told me to do so. What? Can I have 30 seconds to calm down? Okay, I will jump. - Is that funny? Are you laughing? - Yes, of course. Gosh, you even talk back to me like that? I have to punish you at least once! I will spank you. Stay out of my way. I'm teaching my kid. Never again, okay? There you go! Your exact look just then. The fatherly love is just so artistic. It reminds me of my dad! Hey. What? What? Get in there, give me the money. Okay. Wipe off! Wipe off! Producer, payment, producer! For you, Dad. Oh my God. Why did you buy that much shrimp? You got your paycheck today, Dad! It's three million! Are you eating till it runs out? You should save my money. You are an adult. You can have three shrimps. I am little. I should have six. That would be enough for me. - Hey. What? - Yes, Dad? Don't ever jump off the bridge again, okay? How come a girl like you jumps off bridges? You were too worried then, Dad. Roi and I jumped from there often. - Roi and you? - Right. Oh damn, that boy Roi? It's him again. I won't let you visit Sneaky Tam again. Hey? How did you know I'm visiting? We were just talking about you, and now you're here. Hey, come on in. - Let's have some fruit. - Yes. How was it? Have you fully recovered, bro? Forget about my health. Sit there. I need to discuss some issues between us. Roi, come over here. - Yes, sir. - Come over here. Sit down. Listen up. - Listen. - Yes, Uncle. You are not allowed to ask Bunny to jump off the bridge. You hear me? What did you do? Bunny is a girl. What did you think? Why did you get her do dangerous things? No, it's not that, Dad. It's not that, Uncle Quan. Bunny told me to do it. I wouldn't dare to do that. Bunny kicked me off the bridge I did it. I'll go make myself some instant ramen. You, girl. How strong! Go inside and get us some fruit, boy. Yes, Uncle. What a way of teaching your kid. Well, she's a girl. Wake up. Time to go to school. Don't want to wake up? Time for school, darling. One thing I have learned over the last eight years is that I can never prepare perfectly for every situation that comes with raising a child. Your dad must be home. - Continue your homework, dear! - Okay. - Good evening, teacher! - You are home. Here, I have some gifts for you. This is your favorite cake. Thank you so much. Dad, where is mine? How can I forget you? Yeah, you shouldn't. So lovely. Thank you so much. Don't act like strangers. You told me Bunny was sick, so I came over to help her with the lessons. I finished teaching her a while ago, but I wanted to hang around waiting for you. If you came home a little later, I would have needed to sleep over. I couldn't let Bunny stay home by herself. Whenever he goes out selling stuff, I always sleep at home alone. Don't worry about me. Oh yes, Bunny is really brave. It's a piece of cake for her. The neighbors also keep an eye on her for me. - Don't worry. - I will go home now. - Okay, take care. - Okay. You have such a nice bag, teacher. You can have it. Why do you give it away when I just compliment it? Whatever you find beautiful, I will give to you. - I'm going home. - Okay. Goodbye. Dad, does this look tasty? Very tasty. Dad! Dad! - What? - Dad, does my mom look like Ms. Thao Mai? Nope. Your mom can't even compare. Your mom is way more beautiful than Ms. Thao Mai. Why hasn't she visited me? She is doing her duty rescuing the world. Hey, Bunny. Your mom stays in a very faraway land, rescuing little kids fighting against T-Rex as well as devious spiders and other mystical creatures. Your mom is a wonder woman with a super, super beautiful face. And especially, her voice is... soft, gentle, and very attractive. Quan, she is our baby. Help me take care of her please. I am sorry. Dad, why are you quiet all of a sudden? My blood pressure is getting higher. What do you mean? I miss your mom. So I am getting high blood too! What? Why? Because I miss her too. That's too much, lady. You act as if you were an adult getting high blood pressure. But I don't know how her face is now. - Whose face? - My mom's, Dad. You have the photo that I gave you. I mean I don't know how she looks now. That photo was taken a long time ago. You still had a lot of hair at that time. Now you don't have any. So my mom will be like you, won't she? I wish her that. I'm joking, kid! Your mom's hair is like a stream. A DA PHUOC ELEMENTARY SCHOOL Hey, guess what? My mom is Wonder Woman! My mom flies around the world to save the Earth. There is no Wonder Woman in real life. You are lying! I told you the truth. -Dad -What? Does Mom fly with that? Oh, right. That's paragliding. Why do you ask? My classmates told me that my mom can't be Wonder Woman and that I lied. Wonder Woman is only on TV. She exists in reality, so she could fly into the TV. But my friends said I didn't have a mom and that I lied about that. Who said that nonsense to you? How can you exist without a mom? That's ridiculous. Why did you believe your friends when I told you the truth? Bunny, you got a letter from Wonder Woman Mom. Ask your dad what his favorite dish is. I will make it for him. Love you. Why are you walking back and forth? Dad, why is this letter similar to previous ones? Well... so... You know, whenever she writes to me, she only asks about you. - Ms. Thao Mai. - Yes. If you care about us, please help us. Whenever you write letters to Bunny, please get more creative. Oh, I'm sorry. I haven't had a child with you, so how can I be more creative? I have never had a child with anyone, so how can I be more creative? And she is way too deluded about her mom's power. You probably should find a way to explain things to her. How, teacher? Just tell her the truth. Does she deserve being hurt? No, she doesn't. Talking like that will hurt her. It's sinful for us to hurt a child's feelings. It means I won't be able to marry her dad. No... If somebody does that, they can't have her father's affection. I am so embarrassed in front of you. I think like this: let the kids live their own fairy tales. When she grows up, she will recognize the nonsense in fairy tales. That's lovely. What should I do? My Bunny has become too smart. We have to find a way. School has just started. I need to go to my class. See you later. - Goodbye, teacher. - Bye, sir. You should go. What are you doing? Oops, I mistook it. I thought the school gate was my house's door. Goodbye. Hey, hey, hey, take a look! Wonder Woman Mom. Dad, can I talk to Mom? So, do you believe in your Wonder Woman mom? Yes, Dad. - Can I talk to Mom? - Here, let me call her. Let me see. Hey, Wonder Woman Mom, Bunny wants to talk to you. Mom, what are you doing? Well, I am flying in the sky to save all the children in the world. Mom, can you save them quickly then teach me how to fly? I will teach you paragliding, ok? Mom, when will you be back? I will return home on your birthday, okay? Hey, you should not... Yay, Mom is coming home for my birthday! So you will come home before her birthday, right? Right? Oh no, I spoke a wrong line. I was carried away by Bunny. Dad, Mom sounds like Ms. Thao Mai, doesn't she? Quan, honey, who is Thao Mai? Hey, I'll call you back later. Probably your mom is flying close to Ms. Thao Mai's house, so she somehow sounds like her. But your Wonder Woman mom is real, right? You see? Yes, Dad. Mom said she would visit me on my birthday. She will be back for my birthday! I will take her to my school. Nobody will accuse me of telling lies anymore. So are you really looking for somebody to cast Bunny's mom? You're talking nonsense, man! I can tell Bunny directly that her mom left her, let her know how terrible her mom is, let her know that she only needs you in her life. It is easy for you to say. You are not in my shoes. How do you know what to do? If you don't want to help, I'll find someone else. Oh yeah, go find others to help you. Let's see who else will do that. Did I owe him in my previous life? One. Two. Three. - Four. Five. - Stop, stop! Are you gonna count until I pass out? Is that what you want? No, not that, Dad. - I am counting down to my birthday, Dad. - What for? So I can see Mom, Dad. See? I told you. The problem of lying is that you have to continue lying over and over again. Because when you stop, people won't believe you anymore, and you are afraid of hurting them, especially when that one is your own little daughter. Dad! My dear little Bunny, my dearest daughter, I miss you so much. However, I am busy helping younger poor kids around the world. I promise I will visit you as soon as I can. Love you. Dad, what does it mean? So will mom be able to return home for my birthday? So the thing is... We shouldn't take it seriously whether Mom comes home or not. Let's think about the task Mom assigned to you. She told you to fold paper stars. Then you can go with her to orphanages and give them to other unlucky friends. - Okay, Dad. - Okay, then let's work on that project. Hey, how much is this? Hello? Why are you staring at me? Sorry. I just mistook you for someone else. - How much is it? - Twenty thousand. Thank you so much. Let's go, sweetie. Hello? Dad, is this beautiful? Yeah. I didn't even ask Linh how she got my phone number or why she called me. All I want now is that Bunny can see her mom. Bunny! Bunny! Quan. Bunny! That's your mom. No, she can't be. You told me that my mom is Wonder Woman. You lied to me. It's time to tell my daughter the truth. Bunny. But I decided... to continue lying to her. One. Two. Three. Wonder Woman appears! This time, I convinced Linh to go along with my lies. I personally see no problem if that lie brings happiness to my daughter, which then brings happiness to me. And that lie helps them see each other again. Why wouldn't I lie? Great! Fantastic! Happy birthday to you. Thank you, Mom. This is all Bunny wants to do when she is with her mom. You were wrong to put me in that situation. I don't want to lie to my daughter. Do you think that lie is necessary? Should I be honest about how her mother treated her? I'm sorry. Never mind! It's just the past! Actually, I have been struggling for the last eight years to reach the current stable life. Recently, I've discussed with Phat about my daughter. Who is Phat? How does he relate to Bunny? He is my boyfriend. He helped me a lot. You know, the overseas life is pretty good. The living standard and education in Singapore is good. If Bunny has a chance to study there, things would be great for her. So we intend to come back and bring her with us. Then you should ask her! If she agrees, I will let her go. - Bunny, darling. - Yes, Mom? Do you want to go with me? Hey there, what happened? Why do you look so sad? It was a fun night. You should be happy after coming home. You went out happy. You should come home happy. Dad, you won't follow me wherever Mom wants to take me? You should go and live with your mom. She misses you when she is alone. I don't know who that Uncle Phat is, so I don't want to live with him. Uncle Phat is your mom's friend. Uncle Phat loves children. And... He knows how to paraglide too. If you go there, he will teach you how to paraglide. Let me see. Hmm... is he like you? Probably not. My dad is number one! Hey, kid. How come this feels like a Parents Conference? Start eating, Bunny! Just eat, sweetie! Dad, you should eat too. She really is her dad's daughter. Like father, like daughter. Interesting. That's right, Uncle. My dad is number one! If you see my dad flying from the bridge so cool like Superman, you will be shocked. This kid. Why hasn't your mom told me about that? Maybe she thinks you could be embarrassed because you are nothing compared to my dad. This kid. - Are you sure? - I'm sure. - Do you wanna bet? - What bet? When my dad and you both jump off from here, let's see who is better. My dear, I will die. Eat, sweetie. Hurry up, hurry up! Gosh, it hurts like hell. Quickly please! Oh my God! Bro! Help me please. This is my first movie. It's very important to me. Everyone is eating, so how could I help? Really. Your eyes, your lips, they ignite my fire for art. Only you. There is no one else like you in Vietnam, bro. Hey, stop! You act like I am a professional actor. I am an amateur. I don't have such skills. - You are wrong, bro. - You see? Even the film director is amazed by my dad and has to beg him to join his movie. It can't be. I don't believe that. Dad, Dad. Uncle Phat doesn't believe you are an actor. Okay, deal! Stop there! Hurry up buddy. Jump! You got this! You got this, Dad! You can do it, Daddy! You got this, Dad! - That's fantastic, Dad. Amazing! - Good job! Oh, my bro! Your dad is Superman. That's wonderful! Bro, wake up and clean up the setting. Hey, bro. Toothless. Medical team, Toothless. It's okay, Uncle. Let me wake him up. Let me. One. Two. Three. Four. Five. Six. Seven. Eight. Nine. Dad, wake up, Dad. Dad, open your eyes. Help! Emergency! - Dad, please open your eyes. - Come over here! Hurry up! Uncle, something's wrong with my dad. - Call the ambulance! - Dad, wake up! Open your eyes! - Bunny. Bunny. It's okay. - Dad! Dad, wake up, Dad! Yeah! Yeah! Dad, are you back? I know that you are a Superman. You won't die easily. Right, Mom? Why do you always make the story that I am Wonder Woman and you are Superman saving the world? Now she is entitled. I don't want her to be like that. Mom. Can we talk about it another time? It's good if she knows that sooner. I am almost done preparing the documents. I will take her with me sooner. Why do you have to rush? You are rich now. You can visit her here as many times as you want. Now if you bring her with you, when can I save enough to go visit her? You can think of it as motivation for you to earn more money and visit her. You admitted yourself that you can't sponsor her. Will it be better if she follows me? In the worst case, I can bring her back to visit you every year. How many times? How many years? Then I will lose my daughter forever, right? Are you kidding me? If you were me and somebody gave you a child, and you raised her since she was a baby for eight years, then one day, that asshole comes back and takes her away from you and stands in front of you talking like a bitch, what would you do? Would you wanna kill that asshole? Linh. No need to explain to him. Our lawyer will take care of it. I'm done. Teacher, so Bunny... She can go to school now. Oh dear, that's really good news. We never thought that she could have a chance to go to school. Neither of us have any official documents. Hey, I'm listening. Bunny is in trouble for hitting her friend. Please come over here quickly, Mr. Quan. We promise we won't tease Bunny anymore. - Why did you hit them? - Mr. Quan. Don't you hear me? Why did you hit your friends? I'm sorry, Dad. They teased me. They told me that mom is not Wonder Woman. So is your mom Wonder Woman? No, she is not. So was what they said right or wrong? They were right, Dad. Once more, I won't let you stay with me, Bunny. But they said you were not my real father, so now Mom is taking me away from you. I don't want to go anywhere. I don't want to! Bunny! Bunny! Four. Five. Six. Seven. Bunny, baby! Bunny, darling! Bunny, darling! Dad! Dad, I am so sorry. It's my fault, honey. I'm sorry. I was wrong, Dad. Why can't I have both Mom and you, Dad? Why is that when I have Mom, I won't have you, Dad? I want you both. Darling, I love you. You will understand when you grow up, sweetie. I want both of you. Dad! Look! Yes. Let's go to the beach. We are going to the beach. Join us, Linh. You have to wear your life jacket. Do you know why? Because we will land on the water later. We need a life jacket to stay afloat. Yes. Perfect. Mom! She wishes to fly in the sky one time with you. You are here now, so... Wow! So beautiful, Mom. Do you like it? Yes, I do. That's Dad. Bunny! Bunny! Bunny? Bunny! Bunny! What is going on, darling? Bunny! Bunny! Help! Quan! She passed out! Bunny. Quan! What happened to her? Patient's guardians, please follow me. Her acute lymphoblastic leukemia is at the terminally ill stage. I have to let you know, so you can prepare. Her blood type is rare, so I need you two to do blood tests. If she needs it, you can help her. No, we don't need to run through the blood tests, doctor. I am her father. She is her mother. If she needs blood, take mine. I will give her all my blood. I will give her all, Doctor. Please calm down, sir. I know what is best for your child. You two, please follow me! You have to calm down. You have to. Our daughter needs us right now. Calm down, Linh. She is not your daughter. I'm so sorry. A girl? I just found out about her. DNA TEST Mom. I'm here, baby. Where is my dad? He just went home to get your stuff. Take a rest, baby. When you wake up, you will see him. Okay, Mom. I accept your offer. Please take her with you. My financial condition is almost impossible to help her. I had a little fund to get our house back. I will give all that money to you. Please help save my daughter. Bunny won't need to go. Why? You said that you would come back here to take my daughter with us. Yes, I did. Yet, if only she was a healthy child. But she has a terminally ill disease, and she is going to die. What have I said wrong? I just spoke the truth. Bunny won't have much time. And her only wish is that she could stay with Quan. Why don't we let them be happy together? Take your time. Think about it carefully. I realize that my biggest fear is also Bunny's fear. And my biggest fear has come to pass. Why can't I have you when I have Mom? Why can't I have Mom when I have you? I want to be with you both. My fear is that I can't be with my beloved people. I just need Mom to come back with us both. I have been busy cooking for Bunny the whole morning, don't you see? You cooked too much. How could she eat all this? - Let me and my brothers share with her. - Gosh. Uncle Quan, Uncle Quan. Giau also came back? Yes, Uncle. Bunny is sick. I have to visit her. Uncle Quan, where is Bunny? She is in her room. Go, go, go. Hey, boys. Be quiet, boys. Hello, ma'am. Are you fine? What's going on? Do we still have any chance to save her? No. Grab all her stuff and move her to another hospital. We are out of solutions. Even if so, we still have to find other ways. We can't just do nothing and watch her die. Go inside with her. My cute baby. No. What are you doing? Bunny doesn't know anything yet. Don't even think of making her cry! Calm down! Bunny, look who is here! Bunny, it's Sneaky Papa Tam here. Oh look at my little cutie. Are you better yet? - Feeling better? - Yes, Uncle. Get her some oranges, boy. - Why are you standing there? - Peel some oranges. Don't throw stuff around. Let's go play with me. Don't tease her, okay? And at that moment, Linh and I made a promise that our child wouldn't need to choose between her mom and dad... and that we would use Bunny's remaining time to give her a lifetime of memories. We will protect the one thing that every parent must do for their children. Bunny. That is our child's happiness. And my father was right. And Phat was not wrong. In our lives, we have to confront our fears. We have to accept that miracles don't always occur. Oh, oh, oh. I don't dare to open my eyes. Try, Dad. Try to open your eyes. Wow. Wow. Mom. Oh, that's Mom. That's Mom. Dad, play hide and seek with me, Dad. Come over and play hide and seek. Hurry up! I will play with you. Okay, now what are the rules? Dad, you will be the seeker. I will go hide, okay? Hey? Wait a minute. Why do I have to be the seeker? If not you, then who else? Come on, let's play. Hurry, run. Mom, come play hide and seek with us. - But I'm... - Play with me. - Come play with her. - One, two... - Let me take care of the things here. - Go. Five. - Nine. Ten. - Why are you hiding there? Dad! What's that? We are playing hide and seek. You just show me where he is. Now you got caught. He saw you right away. You should hide under the table. Why did you catch me? Why didn't you catch him? Why did you steal my spot? Is there somebody here? Hey. We are brothers, Sang. Why? Come over here, come over here. I got you! Come help Mom. Stand up, boy! You are taller than that bucket. How can you hide in there? Stand up. You got caught. Go over there and stand still. We are doing the BBQ. Why are you guys playing over here? Why are you acting out like this? Over there is you, your wife, and Giau. It's so small, so how can I stay there? If you want to play, be quick. - Why? - Let me join! Gosh, you want to play so bad. You can't lie to us. Let's catch Bunny, then we can start over again. So if we catch Bunny, I can play with everyone, right? Okay, fine. She is hiding over there. Don't tell her that I told you. Old man, you have always been sneaky. Now I will find Bunny and her mom Bunny, Bunny. Are you all right? Your dad has just come. Go hide somewhere else. Hurry up! Go to that side. I got caught! How could you catch me? Fantastic. I caught your mom. Now Bunny, you need to hide very well. I can't find her. How come? So strange! Oh dear, how could she fall asleep while playing like this? Wake up, darling. Bunny is sleeping. Bunny. Bunny, darling. Wake up. Let's go home, baby. Darling, please don't play like that. I don't like it. I would be upset with you, darling. Hey, darling. I will count to ten. If you don't wake up, I will be upset with you. Hey, I'm gonna start counting now. One. Two. Bunny, can you hear me counting? I am counting to two. Three. Four. Five. Bunny, I'm scared. Come back to me, darling. Six. Seven. Bunny. Eight. Nine. Bunny! Bunny! My darling! My darling! Bunny, darling, Bunny! Bunny! Wake up darling, please. Bunny! Bunny! Bunny! Bunny! Bunny, darling, Bunny! Wake up, darling! Please, Bunny! Bunny! Dad. Dad. What? Everyone is waiting for you, Dad. Dad, do it! Quan! You got this! Don't let me down! Bro, this is your first leading role. Let's count together. Sure, Dad. One. Two. Three.
