The Core Studio & Tube Pictures Present A Tube Pictures Production Executive Producer Soma Chung Producers Hwang Woohyun Hwang Jae woo Shin Hakyun Yoon Jihye Special Appearance: Kim Minjun Written and Directed by Park Chulhee What a great day to kill. I wanna live with style. Up against rampaging bulls, flying a red cape. It's a beautiful game. The showdown to kill all the ugly and rude on earth. The thought of it excites me. But we don't have bulls in this country. Cows won't do. Authorized Personnel Only Who is it? Who am I? Not an authorized person. What the fuck! No Mercy for the Rude. Fuck. Am I gonna die? Sure, no doubt So shut up and die. I'm tired. One clean thrust is all it takes to get the job done. That's what being a pro is. And it saves you from an occupation hazard. Look at this pig. What has he been eating? Why am I narrating? I'm a mute. No, the truth is I can't talk. That's right. Too embarrassed to talk. The dead don't talk, right? But it helps me career wise. Wonder why? I don't ask questions. Two things I adore in life are bullfighting and seafood. Let me tell you. I could kill for seafood. When I see fish alive, my affinity for knives sets in. Of seafood, my favorite is seasoned oysters. So yummy. I drink hard liquor after the job. As if water after meals. It takes away the smell of blood. I love the atmosphere of this place. But she gets on my nerves. Look at her flirt. She couldn't get any sluttier. I bet she's boneless. There she comes. I'll ignore her. Oh boy! Didn't I see that coming? Hi. The same kind? Let me have some. I was saving it. Damn! Ocean, I missed you! Here I come, fish! A picnic of killers. Cod, pollack, haddock... I'll catch them all. Every killer has his own color. He was a Karate master. When will he grow up? He's almost 50. After his gym flopped, he became a killer to survive. Good at wringing necks, he can make ends meet now. He provides all the tools that we need. But he never foots the bill. 10 years in the business... ...you're the first to order whisky with noodles. Shut up, punk. Leave! The last job you pulled off, it was perfect. You're such a pro. Check the bank. I transferred the money. Get the receipt, okay? Why laughing like a fool? You're so soft in the head. Tell me something. Why isn't there a boiler in boilermaker? After lunch, we took a commemorative picture. Commemorate what? God knows. One more job, and I'll have enough to buy this building. A heaven for those in need of a place to dance. I must've been a gypsy in my former life. He was a ballet dancer. After injuring his knee, he turned to killing. Look at him go. The way he kills is like a ballet performance. He would look great in Samurai movies. He likes that singer with glasses who got shot dead. Aren't we both disabled? Normal people think so. What's normal anyway? Isn't it a statistic concept by dominance? I didn't get a word of it, but it sounded cool. When the police show up, I play hide-and-seek. Seafood Noodles Lopsided Nuts, Room 206 What's up with her tonight? Honey, what club do you do? Aren't you a club singer? You're so cute. I just... I don't have money for taxi. Stupid or what? I'm coming onto you, and you still put me down? What are you, Buddha? Impotent? I knew you would never make the first move. So here I am, despite the embarrassment. Get it? Who do you think you're, a prince on a white horse? A prince never wears Why wearing shades at night? Are you blind? Lose that freaking attitude. You're nothing. Talk to me. What are you, a mute? Why aren't you talking? Are you a mute? For real? You're a mute? You're a fool. I thought I was the sorry one. Now I'm confused. Where should I sleep? A Field Guide to Cows What a body. The Azalea Study those poems and become a great poet. Write a masterpiece. You can express your thoughts through poems. When they learn I'm a mute, they usually walk. That's been the case. I've never been lucky with girls. What's up with this one? After two days of sleeping, she ate like a pig. You sure can cook. Why only seafood? You fed me. Let me pay you back. How about some workout? An adult workout. Hold still! What the... Leather underwear? You couldn't hold it? Damn. You've been living alone? Nobody else? You're pathetic. Why do I get so small before her? What are you doing? No need to rush. I'm not going anywhere. Slowly. Yes. Don't they water cows at the slaughter house? Let's try it differently. What a way to pay back. Why a long face? Knock it off. I'm not coming back. I'll never come back. So don't worry. Repeating herself, she left after three nights. It was harder than killing. Damn! It almost broke. I'm human. Louder. I'm human! Again. I'm really human! Me too! Treat me like one! You're human waste! Sit! What got into your head? Sticking your dick where it doesn't belong? You had your fun, but we got fucked for it. Forget about it. By the way, who lived next door to you? - Haven't you seen him? - No. Work with me here. I found this in his room. I knew it. He wears leather in summer and shades at night. As if he were a killer. This knife... I bet it's a show. It fits his character. A killer? Did you find out who that is? Didn't I tell you to check with museums? Hey, come on in. Pull up the shades. Though we live in the dark, we need the sun. You're such a moron. Sit down. Why do I have to tell you everything? How are you? They're bad-ass drug dealers. They've gone too far. It's four of them. Can you handle that? He's photogenic. Yeah, he's the boss. Name's Kim... Let me see. Buddha, have mercy. Guns are in these days. But I don't like them. I view myself as a swordsman and am proud. Clients prefer guns, which concerns me a great deal. Bullets are getting expensive. Okay, okay. Who are you? What do you want? - It's you, of course. - What the fuck! Using both a gun and a knife? Are you on drug? I'd prefer using one of them, too. Don't kill me. I just... I don't... I just came by to chat. Look at his eyes. He's stoned. Stoned but innocent looking. What should I do? I paid a fortune for this. Damn it! I'm sorry. Don't kill me. I'm cold. I clean only those ordered, for I'm not a butcher. Above all, I couldn't stab his innocent eyes. Hearts are my specialty. I could've made a killing as a surgeon. Another set of innocent eyes. Why an obstacle on the night I got hurt? A boy with a short tongue. My life got messed up from that point on. Bird poop was a sign. Hey, dickhead. - Hey... you... - Hey... - Hey... you... - Run! Motherfucker! Why? Why? Why? Bitch! Get back here, asshole! You're dead! Stop crying, fool. Stop being a sissy and stand up for yourself. Be a man. The Azalea Study those poems and become a great poet. Write a masterpiece. You can express your thoughts through poems. I'm being adopted tomorrow. In return for the poem book, I gave her my tooth. You know what? I'd wanted to see you win the sword fight. The day she left, there was nothing I could do. A piece of cake. That was the first time I'd ever seen a doctor. So... You want your tongue fixed? You can't talk at all? Urology Repeat after me. 'She sells seashells on the seashore.' 'Shall she sell seashells?' Is that right? Anyway, say it for me. Oh God, I didn't know such a thing existed. You can't? Let go! It can't be done here. I know a specialist in Japan. Name's Koizumi. Oath of Hippocrates Anyway, you got money? It's expensive, and the insurance doesn't cover it. At least $100,000. On top of that, airfare, hotel, food, hooker... Well, a hooker is optional. It still costs a lot. But he can fix your tongue. Bring me $100,000. And I'll take you to him. $100,000! - $100,000? - Or leave. Want some? It's a dried anchovy. So I found a way. Remember. Doing people isn't anything like chopping radish. - You're now... - A killer who kills people! What should I say first after the surgery? Scream at the world? 'Fuck you, World!' No, should I say my name? Order seafood with style? One thing's for sure. I'll say this to her. 'I love you.' Just wait. Be cool and follow my lead. Only if I could run! I kept him alive for you. Finish him. Why are you doing this? Who are you? Now! Nothing personal. We're just doing our job. Congrats on your debut. The guilt doesn't last. We carry out orders. Whether he deserved it or not, it's not our concern. Remember. Morals are a luxury in this line of business. Make a rule of your own. And think about why you chose this calling. This is not it. Meaningless killings. Killings with no memories. Okay, I'll make a rule. While I'm at it, I'll kill only the rude. Only the scumbags until I save $100,000. For I'm a matador. The Azalea I've gotten good enough to win a sword fight. I didn't become a poet but will be a great matador. When I make it big, we'll be reunited. Not everything fresh is good. But you can't hate a kid as fresh as this one. Shit! Picked a spicy one. Eating her words, she comes and goes freely. As if it were her place! Don't fight. Your short tongue is a turnoff. Then again, so is this. How could she say that in front of a kid? - Bitch! - You have a son? Kid, you look weird. - Name? - Kid. - Stop it. - You're so dirty. Take off your underwear. Take them off. You sure it's a toy? It looks real. Fuck me! They're redeveloping the market. And this guy is trying to take all the profit. They want him gone. He doesn't look nice. What do you think? He turns you off, huh? He used to run brothels in the area. He's loaded. You can smell damn money around him. Just think. How many girls slaved to make him rich? Goddamn bastard! I know this guy. It's not gonna be easy. - We need more on this. - You know him? How? I just do. It costs a lot to run a business. Rent, utilities, insurance... It's not as profitable as it seems. Whatever. You need to pay us more. I can't believe this. When'd you get that greedy? Fine. - 5% more. - 10%. - 7%. - 20%. Fine, asshole. 10% it is. Skin a flea for its hide! Sorry but I need money. You're not an artist, but a moneygrubber. We're tying to make this simple for you. So childish, fuck. Make me so angry. Fucking parasites! - Whether you know or now... - Fuck it, give me your finger. - I'll teach you. - Don't use strength... What the fuck! You wanna die today? You little... - Guys? - What? Go after them. Get them! Sons of bitches! Mother fucker! Hit them! Fucking asshole! What are you doing! Stop! Damn, it's the same arm! I said stop! You'll be sorry for this. Fuck! Run! Sir! He got stabbed. Whoever it was, he's a pro. Those bastards... They tried to take the building I wanted to buy. I knew we'd clash someday. Not like this, though. Hey. You're in time for dinner. Hungry? Wash up and eat. I don't know if you'll like it. Come on, get changed. I bought you a rice cooker. A good one. It's almost done. Get changed. You like seafood, right? I bought some... What? What are you doing? What's wrong? What's wrong? Open it! It's me! You messed up. You whacked the brother, not the mark. We're fucked! They're looking for you. I got you a place. Why is the rent so high? Go under and stay cool. What's going on in his head? I'd like to know. Acacia Sugarless Chewing Gum Misfortunes never come singly. How are you, sir? Dad! Oh, you were crying. He got lost and came to us. As a father myself... But he's back safe and sound. Good day, sir. Bye. She'll be here tonight. They never come singly! You bitch! - Let go! - Hey, Where are the girls? I know you hate me, but don't harm yourself. Accept it as your fate. Shut up. Or I'll sew up your lips. What do you want them for? So you satisfy your dick? Aroused? This is what you are. You're weak. Did you brush your teeth? Your bad breath is killing me. Stand up against the storm, and you get blown away. Trying to screw me? Forget it. You're weak. Bring my girls back! Come, please. Please! My teacher wants to see you. He's been bugging me all day. Is he insane? No way that I'm stepping into a school. Over my dead body! Come, please. She told me to bring you. This is my dad. Your dad has tastes. You must be proud of him. He's a smart child. Wait! I'm sorry. It won't happen again. The kids told me you were the best dad. Fucking bitch! Obey your fucking husband! That's enough. You're scaring the baby. I ask for money, and you give it! What are you looking at? Get out of here! Fuck. This is all you have? Bitch! God damn it! Let's go to mommy. Get up. You okay? Midu Motel Fucking bastards. You call this a tip? Fuck you! When I get more money... For the first time, I'm killing without an order. Fuck! What the fuck did I do? You don't know? It's the same knife. I know. What'd you do that for? To find evidence. It's right here! ♫ Even you ire so nice, ♫ if you don't have any money ♫ You don '1' have friends. ♫ neither lover. She killed herself... ...after her monster husband got killed. He was all she had after all. I don't get it. ♫ Even you don't know, ♫ you're cheated. ♫ Only you have money... Sympathy is a luxury. Of all that I've killed it was the only murder. I couldn't be more ashamed. 'Out of love, she licks her baby.' 'Her tongue is...' 'Her tongue...' Look closely. Him! No? - What'd you hit me for? - Shut up! Okay, okay. Any girl in your life? There's this wacky one. Look around. She's usually close by. According to Pygmalion effect... You tell yourself it'll work, and it really works. You can talk, too. Keep trying. Pyg... What? I never remember that word! But it's not always the case. That's life. This building slipped through my fingers. Not that you should care. Scumbags! You know why I hit you? You're putting me in pain. And you're putting me in bewilderment. Should we get married? Let's get married. Surprised? Forget it. The idea just popped up. I can't believe you moved without telling me. Did I ask to move in? Why would I move in with a mute? Am I nuts? You know what? I like you for not talking. That's all. Everybody talks too much in this world. Can you... ...tell me... ...that you love me? Just once. You don't have to mean it. Don't. Let me read a poem. 'When I disgust you and drive you away...' Do I disgust you, too? I know I do. What's this? A Poem? You wrote it? For real? You're something. Let me read a poem written by a mute. Stop calling me that, bitch! 'On the field crowded with the forsythia...' '...a calf is sucking at its mommy's udder.' 'Out of love, she licks her baby.' 'Her tongue is so long.' 'It blankets the baby's face.' 'The baby is happy and starts playing cute.' 'Mommy's milk is warm love like the forsythia.' 'Oh, how beautiful.' 'How peaceful.' 'The calf is sucking at its mommy's udder.' 'And in no time, the baby falls asleep.' That touching? Actually, I wanted to show it to her first. He's die-hard. Come on, boys. It's only one bitch! Nobody needs to get hurt. Know what? I'm a man of manners. Inside that car you took are contracts with shop owners. That's all I want. I don't know what you're talking about. Give me a break. Your friend has them? You don't want him hurt, do you? He doesn't talk. You'll be wasting your time. Deal with me! It's a shame I can't go with you. Asshole! Dumb ass. What is it? Pride? One thing that's fair in life is that everyone dies. Yes, they become equal upon death. Brother... It seemed too typical to throw ashes at the sea. They decided to do it off the cliff. So here I let my friend go. Along with the singer who got shot to death. Rest well. In a bloodless place, my friend. 'A black leaf in the mouth.' It's a poem. The leaf refers to a tongue. Why is it black then? Did it get burnt eating something hot? The poet might've been a lisper. He didn't use his tongue long enough for it to decay. That's why he became a poet. So he could express his thoughts in writing. Wish I could write a poem for my dead friend. But it's a lie that adults can write poems. Nothing on earth is beautiful enough to be written about. So poems are a lie. Everything is a black leaf. Hot! Hot! - You take the kid. - Okay. Should I catch him? Shit, you scared me! Wait. Wait... Those who know knives are afraid of them. What are you doing? Don't do this. Let me live. I'll walk. I'll walk! Bro! It's me. Hi, Mute. It's me, Kim. One with a scarred face. I saw you whack my little boss. You're pretty good. I'll make it short. Inside that car you took are contracts with shop owners. I want them back. And this is all over. What's this smell? Damn, it smells yucky. Fuck! We're fucked! Good thing I brought a gun. Nothing's better than fire to kill vermin. Let me tell you a story. One of my friends gave birth to a girl at 16. She was adopted from an orphanage. And her stepfather married her later in years. Right after she gave birth, he took off. Her daughter grew up and gave birth at 16... ...as if revenge on her mom. So my friend became a granny at 32. What's worse is that... ...the daughter's man was my friend's stepfather. So he's my friend's son-in-law... ...her daughter's father and her husband at the same time. To her daughter's daughter, he's father and grandfather. Complicated, huh? But the granddaughter died before. Her daughter killed herself out of shock. And my friend is thinking about killing herself. But I think it'd be better if she kills the man. In a horrendous way. Only then, it's fair. Right? Life is fucked up. If I were in her shoes... ...I would kill him... ...and leave for the world that's fair. We're having a lovely day. Try to tell me you love me. We're like a family, aren't we? I wanted to go to the USA and become a matador. But the travel agency says there's no matador in USA. Hey, Matador. That cape is so tacky. I'll buy you a nice one. Why hit him there? He's got only two balls. You okay? Are they fine? Did you get hurt? Are you alright? I told my teacher you were a matador. Congressmen are hard to stab because their bellies are fatty. Do you have any idea who I am? I'm a Congressman! This behavior is so ignorant. All my life... University President You sponged off of students all your life. Everyone has a different story when they die. What they have in common is none looks nice. Why don't we pray? I'm not the only greedy one. Jesus Christ will save you from the pit of... Rot in hell, fucker! Only one left now. After him, I'll be able to talk. This took some time. Everybody carries a unique generic information. It differs only by 0.01%. But nobody is willing to give up on that 0.01%. Why? Why can't you accept me? Looking for a girl? Who's she? She treated me like normal and isn't anything like you. I see. There's a girl in your heart that I'm no match for. I sensed it, though. You're so stubborn. Whoever she is, she's one lucky girl. It's your last job. Crown yourself with perfection. Check him out. He's rotten. You'll like the job. What? And I have a personal favor. You once messed up at the market job, right? Can you do his brother free of charge? You don't have to. I just don't feel comfortable. I feel sorry for her. He adopts little girls and rapes them. I have my own story. I like your handwriting. So I made her husband impotent due to malpractice? He was impotent all along. Way beyond treatment. He's alive thanks to me, and she wants me dead? Who's hired to kill me? Are you an assassin? Is an assassin a killer? A killer? What are they paying you? $10,000? That's what my life is worth? A discount price? And on installments. Come on, that's almost nothing for a whackjob. Go ahead. Here's the deal. I'll pay you the double for killing her. You need me to fix your tongue. Be wise. What a dilemma! A dried anchovy. It's damn good. Who are you? Hey! Who are you? She's a mute. Whatever it is, talk to me. Please! How... How... She's never done anything bad to deserve this. She's like an angel, taking care of a sick husband. The winner claims it's the effort. The loser says it's his fate. Urology I'm the latter. I thought it was hope. I've done it for my dream, not for food. Just for that... To be able to talk normally, I've sacrificed a lot. I just started to love myself. I'll never forgive you. Shut up! Shut up! What's going on? Who the fuck are you? Son of a... Who the fuck are you? A detective. You're under arrest for instigation of murders. Tell him. What? You have a right to remain silent and refuse to testify. And to hire an attorney... Do whatever you want. You still don't know it by heart? Let go! I'm dreaming, right? Dream on! Girls, I'm sorry. So sorry that you're dead, and I'm not. I'm so sorry. Isn't it cold in the stone? I don't like wearing them. You know what part of body gets cold most? It's feet. And it's getting colder. 'I don't need it.' 'Stop killing people and use it for the surgery.' '1 want lives to be saved for this amount ' Shit! Stupid bitch. What could be so hard? I'm the one who wants to die. It hurts. 'Son of a bitch.' She says you're a dick! 'And you're a bitch.' He says he knows it. Don't hit me! Stop it! Don't feel sorry for being a mute. You can't take your revenge on the world by talking. It isn't like you. I like you for not talking. And I like you even more for not telling lies. You write poems with your innocent soul. That makes you eccentric. Sometimes I walk aimlessly. As if I didn't have a soul and were haunted. I follow the wind around without knowing... ...where I'm going and who I am. And I always end up at the same place. It's you. You and I... We're like the wind. I wanna be where nobody knows me. Come with me. What should we do with Kid? I'll be back after the hour hand spins 4 times. Be ready, okay? Did you find out? It's the same alley where we found her before. Make yourself useful! He can't talk, right? And you can't handle a mute? Go. Tear him apart! Buddha, have mercy! I don't know him. I don't know him. That's him! That's him! Buddha, have mercy. The Azalea. Kill him, and... 'Let me barrow your gun. ' You know what? Her daughter... She killed herself. I see. You think it's bullshit? You know what? When the wind blows, she goes crazy and takes off. Is it windy outside? Can you see? Hey! It hurts. Being shot... I would've regretted it if I had left without seeing your blood. I can't die like this. No, don't come here. Go back. Get ready. No! Motherfucker! Fuck! Motherfucker! Fuck! You left him for a mute? Who should I kill first? Is this it? Get killed by the rude? How embarrassing. So touching. What a man. Don't! Who the fuck are they? You fucking pigs! Freeze! Stop! No, you can't die on me. You can't. Open your eyes. Open your eyes. Open them. I've wanted to win a sword fight in front of you. I knew it was you. I was too ashamed of myself to tell you so. So I couldn't tell you. I didn't wanna hurt you. So I couldn't tell you. I was going to, - It's okay. - When the time is right... Now I know. But I'm running out of time. Oh, you wanted me to tell you that I love you. I've worked so hard to say my first words to you. That I love you... I... I'm here. I'm right here. I... luv... ya. Fool. You didn't have to tell me. I love you, too. You know what? For the first time in life... I'm happy. It's cold, isn't it? Once you fall asleep, you'll be warm. Brother! Now I'm tired. Looking back at the road I've taken on a bike... It's quite bent. I was positive I was on a straight road.
