I bet you're glowing. I am. I'm so happy you're coming back. Yeah, guess I have Aunty Mavis's house to take care of now, don't I? Lis, you ok? Yeah, it's just, that house is Aunty Mavis. Hey, do you remember when we used to sit out on the porch and she would teach us stitches between playing cards with our moms? Yes. And you wanted to keep it in the family. It is such a beautiful house. And I get to be there for your big day. You're really gonna be there? Wouldn't miss it. Plus, someone's gotta be there to hold David up. I heard that. Stop. He's a firefighter. He'll be fine... I think. I'll put these in the car. -Fine. -Thank you. Ok, Meena, I gotta go. Bye. Talk soon. There's been rumblings. Rumblings? Retail rumblings. Hm. Dropping your clothing line, rumblings. Well, should we be worried? Let's stay positive. Ok, um, actually I could use some help. I'm packing up my samples to donate to my junior high school for prom. That's my girl. But I'm not messing these beauties up for anyone. How's the spring and summer line coming along? Good. I got the first few pieces off to Salvatore. We need these to sell. I know. We have that meeting with Felicity. My memoir. How I got to here. Got where? Jean-Marc. What do you want? Espressos from Antony's. Thank you. Christine? Just to be clear, this is no way puts us back on the relationship path. That ship has sailed, understood? Of course. So... What are you doing for dinner tonight? [laughs] I can't help it. You still take my breath away. Uh, too much? I'm thinking of getting back into the fashion game, Lisa. In a big way. Oh, well you have amazing fashion sense, Jean-Marc. Good luck. I mean it. Thank you. I've heard there's lots of movement in retail. Brands, entire lines being dropped. What do you mean? It was nice seeing you. And you, Christine, always a pleasure. Ciao. It's a little flat. The writer and I... Didn't connect. It shows in the work. Bottom line, Felicity. In its current state, it is unpublishable. So, last month I gave the manuscript to Colin Davenport. Great biographer, ghost written multiple best sellers. He started on the rewrite and is gonna meet with you to iron out some of the details. Well, just have him shoot me some emails and I will answer his questions. He doesn't work like that, it's more of an immersive approach. And, full disclosure, he's an old college friend. Well, I actually just bought my great aunt Mavis's house up in Logenburgh, Connecticut. I'm gonna be setting up shop there for a while. Hoping to get some inspiration for my spring and summer line and my best friend is having a baby, so I couldn't possibly meet with him. He's in Logenburgh. I confirmed with Christine beforehand, it's what made this a good fit all around. Sent you an email. What if I don't agree with his vision? His wife was a fashion journalist, so he's well-versed in that world. Was? She passed away a few years ago. Oh, that's so sad. It was. For everyone. Do they have kids? A daughter. He got so good at fixing other people's literary problems, he's neglected his own original work. Well, can he do it and not drive me crazy? Absolutely. I'm hoping my memoir's release can coincide with my spring and summer line. Synergy. Piggy backing one off the other. Then, let's make this work. Colin has an absolute knack for finding the heart and soul of a project. 'Cause right now, this book doesn't have much. ♪ It's a big deal, I mean a New York designer coming here? I know it is. And you're gonna be working with her on a book. A memoir. Maybe. She has to want to work with me. Well, you're gonna have to up your game. Oh yeah? Just don't get all, like, argumentative, ok? Well, it depends how she takes the changes. Well, change can be hard on some people. That's true, but it's all about the work, right? Well I better get to meet her. Did you see her fall line? I must have missed it. The whole thing, gorgeous. Ok. Good to know. So does this mean that you're gonna be getting into fashion? Maybe. I don't know. I might be good at a few things, so it's hard to decide. Renaissance woman. Like I said, can I please meet her? Hang with Grandma for a little bit while I'm in my meeting and maybe afterwards you can meet her. ♪ ♪ Oh no, he's in the discount bin? I hear that one's not very good. Yeah, it's probably just bathroom reading. Colin Davenport. Lisa Holt. You're taller in real life. Well, perspective's everything. [chuckles] So, when you were 16, your dad was transferred here and then you spent a year at an all-girls prep school, which you hated. And then after graduation you moved to New York full-time, where you interned for an absolute diva. Yeah. [chuckle] And then I got lucky because an up-and-coming pop star liked my revamp of a vintage jacket, which was part imagination and part of it was all I could afford. [both laugh] So, the book, as it stands now? First, can I tell you how I work? Sure. Well, I like to observe you, in the present to give life to your past. Ok. There were some parts that I was really gripped by, but much of it came across like an... Go on. An extended puff piece. I put a lot of work into that. I know you did, but it's still missing you. How you became you. But I'm on every page? It was more of an account of what you did, without emotion it just sits there. We need to tell the story. This isn't just a story to me. I mean, that's my life on those pages. So let's put some life in those pages. You know, I thought we were just gonna like, change a few things. A paragraph here, a sentence there. I know, this must sting. Maybe this isn't the best time for this. Because of your line potentially being dropped? I have some friends in the business still because of Julie. So you mentioned an aunt. A great aunt, actually. Mavis Thorpe. Mavis? She was an amazing woman. I got to spend some time with her during the town archive project. I ended up writing a big character piece on her, actually. I would love to see it. I will email you a copy. That would be great. I have to pick up my daughter, Kira. She's at my mother-in-law's bookstore, where I am currently in the discount bin. And she is desperate to meet you. So nice to meet you, Kira. This is so cool. Can I post this? I loved what you did with plaid in the fall. Did you go to design school and do you sew your own clothes? Yes you can post this, #fabulousholt, thank you. I also love plaid in the fall. I did go to design school and I only sew some of my clothes. I did make this skirt. I love it. Um, I'm sorry. I gotta run, 'cause I'm closing on the house today. I will dig up and find you that character piece I did on your Aunt Mavis. Give it a read. I think I can do your memoir even better. He really is pretty good. Oh, before you go... do you mind? Oh, sure. All right. [camera shutter snaps] -Thank you. -Of course. There you go. Oh, thank you. I will text you, and Kira, it was lovely to meet you. Bye. So? Uh... hmm. It's ok, Mom. No, no you and Dad just, yeah, just stay there. I know, I know that's why you guys moved down to Florida. I know, I know, I just... Yeah, I'll be fine. Yes, yeah. Next big holiday you guys come up, ok? Ok, I love you too. [squealing] Oh, it's so good to see you, Lis. Look at you! Oh, look at you. Oh. Are you ready? Yes. Let's go. Ok. Let's do it. ♪ It's so quiet. Uncle Henry always used to be putting around and Aunt Mavis, sitting on the porch, sewing, hemming someone's dress. It's where it all started for you. Me too. Well, great place to try to get my groove back, right? How are you feeling about the line now? Um, well, the designs I sent off to Salvatore are a real return to form for me, so I just have a couple more to go and then I should be good. Then, maybe I can... You can concentrate on romance? I was gonna say relax and catch my breath, but... Sure, Lis. You catch your breath. Yeah. Then, maybe. Ok, you are incorrigible, Shastakovich. I prefer hopeless romantic. Oh, well maybe that's the hormones talking, huh? Quiet, or you're gonna make me cry. Ok. Shall we get started? Let's do this. ♪ ♪ So, what did that writer guy say about your memoir? He said that it lacked feeling. What? You don't think that's true? Not the words I'd use. Depth, maybe? My editor said the same thing. Ok, Lis, I love you like the sister I never had, but the person in that book is a hollow version of you. Maybe he can add some feeling? Have you read anything of his yet? No. He did send me an article he wrote about Aunty Mavis. First things first. How's Kira? She's a teenager who's becoming a little bit of a fashion diva. Oh, poor you. Has she bugged you about wearing make up? Please, don't even joke about that. How did the meet go with Lisa? I don't think she likes criticism. It's like a foreign concept to her. You didn't say that to her, did you? Kind of. Now, your comeback novel. Hefty advance and you're dreadfully behind. You know what Lionel's like, he wanted to garnish your writing fee. He only agreed not to because you're in Logenburgh and you could get her memoir back on track. So, I'm in fence mending mode now? Yes, Colin. You're almost finished your book. If I can show him more than etchings on a cocktail napkin, he'll be happy. Otherwise, he's giving it to legal. I don't even like riding in the elevator with those guys. It's like being in the cage with the sharks. Ok. I will dust it off. I know that one's personal for you, but it's time. Back to the Holt bio, I don't know if she's gonna go for it or not. You're actually her lifeline on this one. Ok. Then I will try and be tactful. I have a really good feeling about Lisa. She has a lot of character. I can see that. Let's get those pages coming in and get your book going. You only gave me the first three chapters but they were terrific. I know you're close to finishing. Goodbye, Felicity. ♪ That was beautiful. Ok. So the man can write. Colin Davenport. Hm. [sighs] [claps] ♪ -Thank you. -You're welcome. Look, I'm sorry. I can be a little blunt with criticism. Oh, it's ok. I suppose there's a kernel of truth to your comments. A very small, husk-like kernel of truth. The piece you wrote on my aunt was amazing. You're a really great writer. Thank you. That means a lot, and I really respect you as a designer. Kira's been giving me an education. Oh. My memoir could possibly benefit from a little more emotional depth. Ok. Now, I have to see you work. A fly on the wall? One who asks questions. Oh, a talking, inquisitive fly. Got it. [laughs] Exactly. Oh, in that case, do you mind? Um... I like to look back at them when I'm writing, it helps keep me in the moment. Ok. [camera shutter clicks] So why don't we start tomorrow? After I drop Kira off for school. Sure. Oh, but I have a conference call with buyers in Paris late tonight, so if you show up at my house before 11:30AM you will be standing on the porch by yourself. Right. ♪ I waited. It's 11:35AM. Literal and punctual. I thought we'd get started? Not before coffee and pastries. Coffee and pastries. Just give me two ticks. Ready! -Sit there? - Yeah. Ok. So, these are the best in town. I usually don't eat pastries. That's crazy talk. That's amazing. Mm-hm. Bliss. Try it with a sip of coffee. It's even better. Right? And it's like it brings the flavor out. So, what's next, Mr. Davenport? So, I am going to need to ask you some questions and I need you to be honest with me. Ok? Ok, all my foibles laid bare. You don't hear the word "foibles" very often. Yeah, my Aunty Mavis used to love playing Scrabble, and we'd play that a lot, sitting out on the porch. Speaking of which, where is Mavis? Hm? Where is she? The woman who gave you your fashion sense, taught you to sew, to make patterns. The whole shebang. How did you become you? Ok. Um, let's go find her. Ok. ♪ My aunt used to take me to these all the time. Just find old clothes, recut the outfits, use the fabric. I do it partly out of habit and partly because it reminds me of her. You get to see the things that people held dear, you know? That they took care of. The things that last. Ok, not that. Sorry. Go on. When I read your piece on Aunty Mavis, I mean, as a kid I'd heard about all the things she did, but when you put them in the context of the times, like you did, it was amazing. First woman to be elected to the School Board. Yeah, where she rocked the power pantsuit before there even really were power pantsuits. The little things that make a big difference. Yeah, like getting the School Board to change the uniform dress code for prom? That was huge. And then the girls who couldn't afford dresses, she would help them sew, alter and design new ones. Even when I was little and I would help her, I, I didn't realize how big of a deal that was, you know? It was just like something she did. Why do you do that? Well, it's a rough fit for me, size wise and then I get to see where it falls on the color pallet. Spring, summer, fall. You're a summer. And you? Guess. Fall, definitely a fall. Correct. There we go. Good eye. Now, if it's ok with you I am gonna send you some questions, so you can answer them and I can get used to words to describe you. I am confused a bit between boyfriends. So, between New York and Paris, they seem to be a Jean something. Well, I guess, when you look back there seems to be a definitive Jean phase. But only one of them, however, spanned two continents, and that was Jean-Marc. The one who broke your heart? Yep. That's the one. That's not a lot of detail. Nope. First adjective that comes to mind? Broken, betrayed, I don't know. Crestfallen. I think I'm gonna leave crestfallen out of it. Well, you can use whatever word you like, but the rest is off the record. Oh! Look at those boots. Tell me about your first fashion line. Where'd the inspiration come from? Well, when I finished at design school, I lived in a shoebox-sized apartment and interned for less than no money. Keep it going. With the money I was making, three outfits for work was all I could afford. But, the way I did it, you could combine each of them and get multiple looks. So, I could have a different outfit for every work day and look like I spent a bunch of money when really, I didn't. That's kind of what I want my new line to have, you know? Be something beautiful that also has this like... Utility? Hm, not exactly the word I would use but I just want the woman who buys it to feel good in it. You know, having something beautiful that fits you well, it just gives you so much confidence. Does that make sense? Be like wearing Yankee pinstripes. Huh, I don't know. I don't really follow sports. Anyway, I want my spring and summer line to have that adaptability built in and a little retro style as homage to my Aunt Mavis. This is the most excited I've been about a line in years. Yeah. Take me through that process. Ok. All that, for ok. Well, my creative process is a big part of who I am, so, I need to be sure. All your secrets are safe with me. ♪ I like the lines of this one. And you're gonna bring these together in some way shape or form? Yeah, hopefully. Are these yours or hers? Um, these ones are mine and those were Aunty Mavis's. Your take on her style. Here. I'll show you. Ok. [sewing machine whirring] Great, now you. Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Oh yeah. Come on, sit down. There is a peddle on the floor which controls the speed of the machine. You've lost me already. Ok, here, put your hands on the fabric. -Ok. -Ok. Ok, good distance away from the needle. And you put a little bit of pressure on the foot pedal. It'll start going. [sewing machine whirring] Woah! Great. A little more gas. That's cool. Yeah. Woah, ok, that's enough. Step aside, rookie. [sewing machine whirring] Here we go. Ok. Oh, that's the wrong way. That's amazing how those came together. Well, you know, it's the time you put in. So much of that time was spent chatting with Aunt Mavis. Just made the time fly. I have to let the sitter go. Well, I, I hope this informed your work. On that note, I am gonna send you some more questions and you just answer them with the first thing that comes to mind. You're gonna know me better than I know me. Oh, um, I'd like to start each chapter with a life quote from Aunt Mavis. I, um... she had some really good ones. I love that. -Good night. -Good night. Bye. ♪ How's working with her, Colin? I'd say pretty good. I'd say two shades before pretty good. Oh, I forgot everything revolves around the color pallet. Well, there's gotta be some order to the universe. [chuckles] Well, once I got my ego to step aside. Hm, how'd your ego take it? That should really be my question. By all means. As long as she answers, I don't mind. It's all about getting the words on the page. By the way, my ego could get used to this, ok. She can't be fabulous at everything, right? Isn't she humble? Was she like this growing up? Go ahead. Oh, my goodness! She was the kid who had her Barbies alphabetized. Yeah, but didn't everybody? And, as you can imagine, they had quite a few outfits. Yeah, I only wish I had half those outfits in real life. Oh, I wanted those sparkly boots. -Oh, yes. Good choice. -Mm-hm. My Aunt Mavis actually made a lot of the clothes. That's kind of how I started, you know? I learned the whip stitch, the ladder stitch, the blanket stitch. And you know what they say, if you can sew Barbie clothes... You can sew anything. How do you think she feels about being back in Logenburgh? I think happy, for now. The porch here certainly holds a lot of memories for both of us. That being said, her life is still mostly in New York. Enough about me. About time. Now, where for lunch? I think the question is what does baby Shastakovich want for lunch? Possibly crepes with a side of pickled red cabbage. Oh, don't judge me it's... An interesting combo. He has an expense account, right? Yeah, yeah. Actually, the per diem really isn't that... I'll go get the keys. Ok. I think I answered all the questions. Hope you don't think I'm crazy. [claps] [notification alert] You're opening up. This is good. [phone vibrating] [notifications] Good morning, Christine. Good morning yourself. You're up early. I am. What's the deal with this investment group offer? Oh, they're kicking the tires. Do we know who's behind the money? Oh, a numbered company. Why? I just, it feels like something Jean-Marc would do. I'll find out. Now, you and this new writer, how are you getting on? Colin? Pretty great. I'm enjoying the hectic pace, I'm loving being back in Logenburgh. The spring and summer lines are looking good and I think I'll have some new patterns off to Salvatore by next week. Fantastic. Anything I can leak on social media? Um, oh, I have some vintage fabric I was gonna use. I could post those. #fabulous. Whatever you're doing, keep it up, because Felicity is loving the pages you're sending in. It's so good to get some good news. Yes, very positive. Now, tell me about these vintage fabrics. Ok. So, I have this amazing idea. Hm. Ready set? You bet. How's it going with Lisa? Actually, I'd say pretty good. I like her. I know you do. She's pretty talented, hey? She's funny, without even trying. So, what about your book, Dad? Are you ever gonna finish it? Why? I saw it open the other day. Why'd you stop? Well, I had to find paid work in between taking care of you and your mom. And then I got pretty good at it. I am getting some pressure to finish it now, though. You wouldn't let me get away with anything unfinished. Well, the reason why you saw it open is because I have been working on it. In between Lisa's, and her memoir, she just has to approve the changes I've made. A little bit more polishing and then both will be done. Well, that's good. I didn't want to take away your screen time. [school bell rings] See you after school. So, an investment consortium made an offer? They did. Won't they... License every discount manufacturer to pump out Lisa Holt designs so that I become a bulk discount bin designer? I know a thing or two about discount bins. Just trying to figure out where the money's coming from. Maybe, you should get your mind off it before you take someone's eye out with that. Is that just like a standard dad line? It works surprisingly well, most of the time. Now, Mavis had a bike, didn't she? The one with the basket? You know how to ride a bike, right? So, are you really thinking about selling your line? I'm looking at the offer. Sales are lagging, rumors that my brand's getting dropped, and not exactly a lot of people lining up to carry my line. You're in a tough spot. Just trying to keep my options open. It's hard to give something up that you put your heart and soul into. Well, let's hope it doesn't come to that. So, what about your designs then? Well, I kind of got away from the core design aesthetics that Aunty Mavis taught me. You know, in the beginning I wanted to do these, like, big frilly dresses. That haute couture runway style but... But? It's not me. Not anymore. Well, it's not etched in stone. You can morph into whatever you like. Well, designers get pigeon-holed. You're this, or you're that. I just feel like I'm taking a really big risk with this new line. I think you have the talent to do whatever you want. So, what about you and your work? -My stuff? -Yeah. Well, my comeback novel has been painfully close to being finished for a while now. Mm-hm. And I haven't wanted to, for some reason. Julie, she used to give it one last read. Made it feel like it was really done. A seal of approval? Yeah. A bit. She had a flair for finding typos too. [laughs] [laughing and chatting] [school bell rings] Oh, man. I haven't been to school in so long. Hey, Lisa. Hey, Dad. Well, nice to see you too, Kira. You know, I think I have some dresses that might fit. Dad? Well, I'm not gonna say no after that. What about tonight? It is pizza night. My first month in Paris was lonely. I mean, it rained a lot, I didn't know anybody. I would just spend days staring out of cafe windows. I mean, I came this close to pulling the plug and coming back home. Why didn't you? Well, because I knew it wouldn't last, and thankfully it didn't. Oh, and then spring came and in Paris, that might as well be the eighth wonder of the world. I, um, I got a job cutting patterns for Chanel, made some life-long friends and then after a couple of years of really grinding, I finally got the chance to design. Are you writing all this, 'cause this is good stuff. All up here. She is definitely your daughter. Ok. Spare room has three dresses on the bed. Why don't you go pick one, try it on and let me know what you think, huh? Mirror's behind the door. Kira? I'm gonna wash my hands first. Sheesh. You are a really good dad, Colin. Because I taught her to wash her hands? No, you guys have a great rapport. Thank you. We worked at it. I mean, ideally I'd like to be the moody writer type, but Kira's a little ray of sunshine. At least she was until recently. Well, instead of being the moody writer, you've got a moody teen. I was that teen. I mean, now and then, she's still my little girl. Awe, not attitude. [chuckles] What do you think? You look so much like your mother. I'm just gonna pin it. Ok. Ok, you need to stay still. So great. Here we go. Perfect, and I will just get these a bit. Yeah. I'm totally in love with it. I love hearing that. Ok, just gonna get a picture. Of course. All right, can you just throw your shoulder back a little bit? Yes, perfect. [camera shutter clicks] Ok, be careful taking it off. Just make sure the pin stays in place. Got it. It's so nice to see her so excited. Seeing a girl's face light up with the perfect dress, it's like the best feeling ever. I think that if I ended up just making prom dresses and doing alterations, I'd be happy. So, an eyeshadow to match the dress would be perfect. I think it's time for the makeup talk. Oh, no. I'm not going there. [doorbell rings] Christine. What are you doing here? They're dropping my line, aren't they? They are. Lagging sales and lack of big name panache. They actually said "panache"? Ok, did you find out who's behind the investment group offer? No. We gotta start working the phones. Yeah. It's gonna be a long night. I'll go make some coffee. Seeing strong female figures in action is great for her. Well, I guess that would make me a role model, wouldn't it? Yes, it would. Salvatore, how good to finally talk to you. So, what are you trying to do here? Um, well once our retail line got dropped, we also lost our slot at Salvatore's. That's a contract manufacturer, right? Yeah, one of the best. They can trace some of their raw silks back to Marco Polo. We were really lucky to get in with them and we're just hoping he can squeeze us in for a limited run between his big design house orders. So, Christine's on the phone with him now, so I can at least maybe have a product available online. One moment. Salvatore. [speaking Italian] [speaking Italian] Thursday? Oh, you want the pieces by next week? [speaking Italian] Ok, do you know what we do next? First proofs back, we have a photoshoot right here. That way we can at least get something online. Livestream something. Yes, like a fashion event. Create some heat. Heat's good. Yes, or else I'll have a warehouse full of stuff that I can't sell. You sure you can get those designs done and those patterns cut? I have to, don't I? This is where I'd say something like, you gotta cowboy up. I never thought I'd hear you say "cowboy up". I know.

I actually like the changes you made. I think that I'm gonna leave it in your hands. So, when you think it's ready, submit. Thank you. I know that's a lot of trust, I just have a couple sections to look over and I think it's ready. I don't know how to end it, though. I think there's more there. To my story? -Mm. -Hm. I guess I'm just holding out for a happy ending. [phone chimes] I have a line on something interesting. I thought you might want to check out. Come on. So, how do you know this guy? College roommate. Were you the clean one? No. How? It's an old prop house. They're selling everything for rags, so I thought it would be worth to go through. I mean, for someone like you. You did great, Colin. Thanks. [camera shutter snaps] Hm? Yes, but the fabric, that's the key. I can maybe make a one-off for the photoshoot. You got a lot on your plate, huh? [whispers] Yeah. Ooh. Oh. What do you think? For Halloween? Huh? Come on. That's not bad, actually. Ok. My turn. [upbeat music] ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ ♪ So, when do you need to hear back from Bahn-Franc? Pretty quickly. They want me for the fall, but just so in love with my new retro inspired line and I don't know if it'll fly with them. I'm calling it Retro Functionality. And I know that's just a made-up term, but it's funky, it's confident. It's kind of an homage to my Aunty Mavis. A very stylish, yet practical woman. I like it already. Oh, um, you said we could fill up your trunk, right? Yes, if you enlighten me on this new retro functionality concept. Ok, so, a woman buys two of my vintage inspired outfits and she now has multiple combinations because all of the colors are complimentary and all the accessories, everything. Everything can be combined. It's kind of how I started at the beginning and, I don't know, I think it could be huge. I want to thank you for this. I should be thanking you. I haven't had this much fun in a while. I mean, I've had dad fun, but Colin fun's kind of been in short supply. Well, I'm happy to hear that. [phone buzzes] Everything ok? Mm-hm. You know, why don't I take this out to the truck? Thank you. Thank you. Hey, stranger. Fee! What are you doing here? Thought I'd pop around and see how things are going. Lionel? In that case, I have some good news. I'm listening. I have decided to hold off, there's more. That last draft felt ready. Just trust me. Ok. The work feels personal. The most personal it's been since... I know. You like her. It shows in the writing. That's a good thing, right? On both counts. Have you ever thought about, can I get one of those? -Uh-huh. -Thanks. Yeah, put it on his tab. Yes, I have thought about it. What's not to like about Lisa Holt? She's funny, pretty, smart. Can't be in a bad mood around her. But... It's ok to put yourself out there. You don't have to shut down and build an emotional fortress. Can my emotional fortress be made out of Lego? Be serious. Fee, I've had a lot of serious. Just, haven't been ready. Kira's in this too. I don't know how those two things are gonna mesh. I get that, completely. Maybe when Kira's older. Colin, you can't just close up shop and reopen five years later. You'll be stale and out of date. So now I'm day-old bread? Now, what about your manuscript? What about it? Colin, seriously. What do you say, I get two gems to Lionel in one calendar year and he gives me a big fat raise. Well deserved, I may add. Be a win-win. You know what would be the heat from Lisa's bio linked to your own work but you've got to finish it first. Why don't we just go make some copies? You've done it? You! I thought about it for a while now. Finally got it done. It felt like it was the right time. I can't wait. Some of the stuff he's written about me, I mean, it's like he sees the real me. I mean, with everything else that's been going on, he's been a rock. Well, I like what you let me read. Timing couldn't be better. Introduce your new clothing line on the heels of the best seller. And I got the top event planner in the city for our little fashion shoot. It's moving forward and my cousin is going to Tweet and hoot and whatever the kids do these days. [phone buzzes] What? It's just Jean-Marc. He's bugging me to meet with him. Don't do it. The guy's like French kryptonite. Les kryptonite. Bahn-Franc isn't coming to Logenburgh. It's a take it or leave it proposition and they request an answer. You know, I've been sitting back waiting for things to happen instead of making things happen. It's time I took back some control. Are you sure? Yes. My Aunt Mavis used to say, bet on yourself. So I'm gonna do just that and bet on me. And I'll reiterate to Bahn-Franc that this isn't a negotiating ploy, but a stylistic commitment to your vision. We're doing this? Yes. Hey, maybe this is just the happy ending my memoir needed? Spunky heroine... -With a heart of gold. -With a heart of gold. Successfully launches her boutique fashion brand. [phone chimes] And lives happily ever after. It's all coming together. They're holding up your memoir's release. Someone at Bahn-Franc or the investment group knows someone at the publisher. They're using this as leverage. This isn't leverage. This is Jean-Marc. See? Les Kryptonite. ♪ Thank you for this. It's good to keep busy. I'm glad you liked the memoir. I know some of it couldn't have been easy. Yeah, reliving the bad bits was not a great experience. Without saying too much, you got the whole Jean-Marc situation down in excruciating detail. Yeah, there was a lot in the tabloids. I want to thank you for giving it the life that it needed. I'm sorry that they're holding up the release. Yeah, not exactly the happy ending we were hoping for, is it? I've really enjoyed my time with you. Writing can be kind of solitary and bouncing ideas off you, never knowing what I'm gonna get. Well, if anything, I'm entertaining, right? [laughs] That you are. I really enjoyed the change, too. So, um, I guess this means we're kind of almost done with our collaboration? Oh, I hadn't really thought about it. Well, I'll see you around town? It's not over until we find an ending. Felicity strongly agrees. Ambiguity, never good for an ending. So, I guess we'll just let it play out, right? Yeah. We should. For the book. Of course. I, um, I was hoping you and Kira could come to the shoot. They'll be hors d'oeuvres and appetizers and stuff. And we get to catch the unveiling of the Holt Retro Functionality line. Man, I am really shooting up the dad ranks. Thank you. I was thinking that maybe we could celebrate the small victory of nearly being done by maybe grabbing a bite to eat tonight? I'd like that. Ok. Ok, great. Ok, I'm gonna, I'm gonna get back. Yes. Cool. ♪ ♪ ♪ [laughing] Feels so good to be out of the house. I feel like I can't relax at home, you know, when I have all this unused fabric just sitting on the cutting table. It's like I just want to make something out of it. I love those times when I'm writing and I can't stop. And the words flow and you just go. Mmmhmm, yeah. Ok, so, if I was writing the biography of Colin. Mmmhmm. Middle name? Walter. Colin Walter Davenport. Ok. What's something the folks at home should know? Notoriously unhandy. I'm definitely not your fix your faucet kind of guy. Really? I once nailed my sleeve to a fence. [laughing] I can't believe I didn't get caught up in the patio lights. [laughing] And I keep my ties tied. What, so you can just slip them on over your head? Yeah, I never learned. I guess it kept me from being a lawyer or an accountant. So, I haven't done this in a while. Me neither. But I can definitely see myself doing more of this. You know, when things settle down a little. Me too. That was really nice. -Yeah, it was. -Yeah. Oh. Caviar, aged cheddar, champagne? Woah. They are serious. Who? The investment group. Is it a good offer? It's a great offer. It's got a five year non-compete. It means I either start from scratch or behind door number two, I let Bahn-Franc dictate my style and where I fit into their brand. Or, door number three, you could set up shop for yourself. Yeah, that's scary. I mean, I'm not sure if the grind is gonna be worth that in the long run. Ah, it's about the process. The journey. It's not all about the big check in your hand. It's a five year non-compete. I mean, I could come back. Creativity doesn't work like that. Can't just turn it on and off. Well, we're different people, Colin. What's that supposed to mean? You stopped creating your own work to fix other people's. I mean, you're very good at it, but... What about the fashion shoot? Salvatore squeezing you in, it just feels like you're quitting. Ok, you know what, you come talk to me when you put yourself out there. Maybe if you finally submit your manuscript you'll know how this feels. I'm sorry. I finished my manuscript. A few days ago. Just waiting for the right moment. Would have meant a lot to me for you to read it. Colin... [car engine starts] [sighs] [claps] Really? [doorbell rings] Colin? Hello. What are you doing here? It's good to see you, Lisa. Can I come in? It's very early. You would never get back to sleep and I'm jet-lagged. Let us make the best of it. I don't think so. Did you like the gift basket? Champagne, caviar, probably an aged cheddar. How... My family trust is heavily involved with the investment group and as of last week, we also own Bahn-Franc. We make the announcement at the end of the month, so can we talk? You get my memoir back on track or I'm gonna leave you out on the porch until February, for all I'm concerned. I had to delay things until I read an advanced copy. Wait, wait you, you blocked it because you hadn't read it yet? Yeah. Argh! That is so, so you. Hm. So, what did you think? I come off as a playful cat so I have no issues with it. We needed to see if it... Affects your brand? You probably only read the parts you were in. Yeah. Fix it. [chuckles] Fix it! Two texts, tops. Then do it. Ok. [message sent notification] You look... good. So, are you here as a Bahn-Franc representative or are you just here to make sure that the investment group's gift basket got here on time? [chuckles] Really, Jean-Marc. What are you doing here? First, I must apologize to you for having been a... For not respecting you. Water under the bridge. There's someone else, isn't there? Maybe. I don't know. Kind of left off on bad terms. Hm. ♪ Voicemail: Hey, you've reached Colin. I'm not able to take your call right now, but I'll get back to you as soon as I can. Hi Colin. Um, I, uh, I just wanted to say I'm sorry for how things ended the other night. I, um, I guess I was just upset with everything that happened, and... Yeah, I, as a fellow creative, I know how hard it is and really, I just, I miss talking to you and bouncing ideas off you and I mean, we still don't have an ending to our story, right? Anyhoo, I was hoping that Kira could model the dress I made for her. If that's ok with you, of course. So, anyway, I was just calling to say, I... [phone beeps] I'm sorry.

And you've kind of been hit or miss these last couple days. I know. I'll be in good form, I promise. Let's get photos with the technology made this century. One. I get one Polaroid, and I will be Mr. Digital Photography Man, ok? Ok. You should talk to her before then, Dad, don't just leave it hanging. You're wise beyond your years, Kira. Get it from Mom. Yes, you do. Ok. I don't know, Meena. I mean, Jean-Marc's offer is really good and Colin's not returning my calls. Ok, ask yourself this. What's your life gonna be like if you sign with him? And is it gonna be worth it? I mean, would you ever have time to be doing this kind of thing? Sitting on the front porch with your bestie? You can smell the cherry blossoms from down the street. Or, do you like sleeping on that futon thing in your office? No, I don't. [sighs] That's some really good advice. Mm, I'm gonna be a mom. Mm. I gotta start coming up with this stuff. You know, if I want to put big gold buttons on a winter coat, I don't want marketing to tell me that I can't. What about Colin? I don't know. You should talk to him. I know, I know. I invited him to the shoot. Oh! Which is gonna be awesome. I just, I feel like I've shared so much of my life with Colin. And seeing Jean-Marc again made me realize that we weren't good for each other even back then. I think you should totally give him a chance. The way he looks at you, oh, what do you have to lose? Ok, I will give him a chance... Oh, I think it was a contraction. Oh. Um. You, you can't have the baby now, I mean you haven't had the baby shower yet. Oh, I think the baby wants to be there too. -Oh, oh, no. -No, that's ok. Um, what do we? -Ok, it's coming. -It's ok. Oh no, I'm gonna miss your shoot! No... Listen, Lisa, I wanted to tell you...
