A RISKY VOCATION Catherine! Open the door! Maurice! Come here, hurry! Roussel wants to talk to you. In your capacity as mayor. As mayor! Is it more important than my work? The voters don't pay our bills. Hi, Maurice, what can the mayor do for you? What? Are you serious? I'll be right there. A teacher can kiss a female student without meaning harm. Sure, and try to rape her too, no big deal. Rape her? That's going a little far, Mrs. Roussel. He tried! At first, she didn't say anything. How could she know at her age? When he put his hand inside her blouse, she fought him off. Look! Catherine, look at me. Is that really what happened? Yes, Mr. Baudoin. Maurice, can you see Doucet doing that? Why would she make it up? You can't really believe that, Mr. Mayor. I don't believe anything yet, I'm still finding out. What exactly happened between -Catherine and you? -Nothing happened! It's all the village gossip about that lighter. What gossip? What lighter? A few days ago, last Friday to be exact... Be seated. I don't usually smoke. In class. Mrs. Doucet won't let me, and she's right. A teacher shouldn't set a bad example. But today, to break in this very nice lighter, I'll make an exception. You know everything, Josette, tell me how this lighter got on my desk. -I don't know. -Are you sure? Yes. -What about you? -I don't know either. Children, this is by far the nicest gift I've ever gotten. Or at least the most thoughtful. But it's not my birthday or my name day. So why the lighter? Hélène, you tell me. -I don't know. -Are you sure? -I swear! -You, Brigitte? -I don't know. -Of course not. If Hélène doesn't know, neither do you. -You, Catherine? -I'd tell you if I knew. I believe you. Then who gave me this lighter? No one? Thanks. Thanks, no one. -Know how much it's worth? -I'd guess 20 or 30 francs. I almost bought you the same one not long ago. But since you lose everything, I balked at the price. It cost 15,000 francs. What? -Old francs. -Are you sure? That complicates things... Quiet! We have something to settle. Whoever bought me this lighter still won't admit it? No one has anything to say? Sit down. Listen to me. Each of you has an envelope before you. Open it. Gérard, how many students in the class? -28. -That's right. Each envelope contains 5 francs. Who can tell me what 28 times 5 is? -140. -Good, Catherine. 140... 140 francs. The price of the lighter. Do you understand? I gave each of you 5 francs. Now we're even. All right? -Can we spend it? -Of course. You'll soon have the chance. What happens Sunday? The fair! Another 5-franc bill! What did you do, rob a bank? Thank you! -Is it good? -Yes! Fantastic! You're good for business, Mr. Doucet. Did you find out anything about the lighter? No. If my husband got an expensive lighter, I'd wonder... The next day, Catherine Roussel's behavior changed. Settle down, kids, the fair's over. Time to get serious. We'll start with this month's grades, the second-to-last of the year. -Gérard, hand them out. -Yes, sir. The girls beat the boys again this month. Not by much, just a half mark. First is Hélène Arnaud. 17, good work. Second, William Gérard, 16 1/2, no change there. Third, Sylvie Bourgeon, 16. Fourth, another boy... ...Georges Couzevelou. Fifth, Catherine Roussel, down 3 places. I'm not surprised. So, Catherine, the tributaries of the Loire? -Can you name one? -No. -You didn't learn the lesson? -No, sir. Too bad, you get zero. Catherine. Catherine Roussel, I'm talking to you. Why didn't you do the problem? Didn't know how? No, sir. Zero, for the second time this week. That's a lot for a good student. Want to hear the rumors about the lighter? Sure. Mrs. Monnier, the butcher, was happy to give me the details. Catherine Roussel's the one who gave you the lighter. -Catherine? -Yes. Because she's in love with you. The proof is that she has a picture of you in her binder. Now you know. Time's up, you can go. Catherine, you stay. Good-bye, kids, see you tomorrow. 'Bye! See you tomorrow. We need to talk. I think there's something funny going on in there. I'd like to know what. Why didn't you do your homework? -Didn't know how. -Look at me when I talk to you. You didn't know how or you didn't want to? -I didn't want to. -You didn't? Why not? Because it's useless. Doing your homework's useless? Interesting! -Why? -Because. Because why? -You won't answer? -No. Did you give me this lighter? -No, why would I? -Exactly, there's no reason. People say you did because of that picture. -Do you have a picture of me? -Yes. Where is it? In here? Don't bother, you won't find it. -Is it at home? -None of your business. A little brat has my picture and it's none of my business? What about your parents? Pick up your things. We'll go to your house and find that picture. Here, I don't want it anymore. And in a swimsuit! Where did you get this? Did you steal it? Of course! Why? To give your little friends a thrill? They can all enjoy it. Now everyone'll get to see it. Pick up your things. Get out of here. Go play with dolls and do your homework. Lose that scowl if you want us to be friends again. No good-bye? Then she left, her binder under her arm. I didn't touch her... ...in any way. I didn't even punish her. Why make it up? Who knows? Kids will do anything. It's simple. You may not realize it, but Catherine's a woman. What's more, a woman in love. You treated her like a kid, you humiliated her. She's getting revenge. You seem skeptical, Mr. Baudoin. Then why did she steal the picture? How could I have stolen the picture? And from where? -Ever been to Mr. Doucet's? -Never. -He gave you the picture? -Yes. Why? Because he likes me, that's what he said. Do you seriously think I'd hand out a picture like this? Did I force Catherine to keep it? I kept the picture because I like Mr. Doucet too. Or I used to. You liked him in what way? Like my dad... ...but not quite. Almost. He's always been nice to me. Why did you never mention that picture? I was afraid people would laugh. -But you showed your friends? -Never. How does the whole village know? It fell out of my binder and the other kids saw it. What did Mr. Doucet say when he took back the picture? I had to give it back because everyone knew. -Including his wife. -Obviously. He said he'd give me another one later. It wasn't because he didn't like me anymore, he did. He kissed me, then... It's OK! That's enough now. Time for her to go to bed. Do what you like, Mr. Baudoin. But we're filing a complaint tomorrow. Let them file a complaint if they want! They'd never take that kid's word over mine. Either I've lost my mind or she's lying. Be careful! If you don't come up with proof, Doucet will countersue. And he'll claim damages. I'd reconsider if I were you. Not me. Think about it, you're taking a huge risk. If she were your daughter, what would you do? I wouldn't file a complaint. Wait a minute, here's what I suggest. Vacation's a month away. I'll see to it Doucet doesn't come back in the fall. How does that sound? If you say so. Slink away like a coward? That'd be like admitting guilt. I won't do that. Think about it. If they can't prove the girl lied, it's worse for you. I've thought about that. Listen... It's all my fault. Why your fault? We don't have children. So what? To Catherine, her parents, the mayor and everyone else, if you don't have kids, you're as good as single. You're not part of the world of parents. If you were, Catherine's parents wouldn't believe their daughter. You'd be like a father to Catherine. In other words, an old man. Not a Don Juan. Because of the kids we don't have, we're facing a horrendous nightmare! Suzanne! Mom, my Sunday dress! -No school today? -They're here! -Who's here? -The police, like on TV! Has he ever kissed you? No, sir. You never saw him do anything improper to the other girls? No, sir. Young lady... Did you see the picture Catherine had of her teacher? Yes, sir. About time! -This one? -Yes, sir. -Did Catherine show you? -No, sir. How did you see it? -It fell on the floor in class. -Did she say where she got it? No, sir. -Sure? -Yes. You think Catherine gave him that lighter? -I thought so. -But not anymore? Someone else? -Maybe. -Who? -Hélène. -Hélène who? -Arnaud. -Why Hélène Arnaud? -She's the teacher's pet. She was seen going to meet him at the fair. -You saw her? -No, Annette Thomas did. I didn't see her, my parents and little brother did. -Right before the fireworks. -Were they together? I don't know, I think so. Hélène Arnaud! -Hello, Hélène. -Hello, sir. -You're top of the class? -This month, yes. That's very good. What do you think of Mr. Doucet? -He's very nice. -Always treated you properly? -Yes, sir. -Know what Catherine says? Do you believe her? -No, sir. -Why not? Just because. So you don't think much of her? -You heard about the picture? -What picture? -Or the lighter? -Yes, sir. Who do you think gave it to him? -I don't know. -No idea? No, sir. -Not much interest in others? -No. Others are interested in you. What were you doing the night of the fair on... -The Chastenay road. -That's right. Cat got your tongue? Were you there or not? No. -Sure? -Yes. -Were you at the fair? -Yes. -Alone? -No. -With who? -Brigitte. -Brigitte who, for God's sake? -Canet, my best friend. During the fireworks? Yes, I was with her all night and we walked home together. -Obviously. -Why obviously? We live together. Mr. Canet works for my dad and Mrs. Canet's our housekeeper. Hélène didn't leave your sight all night? No, sir. -You walked home together? -Yes, obviously. Annette's right, I was on the patio with my wife and kid. We had about 10 minutes to go before the fireworks when we saw the Arnaud girl go by. Someone should tell her that's not the way home. Unless she's meeting a guy... And her dad thinks she's as pure as driven snow! Here's her sweetheart. Strange time for a private lesson! Leave the poor man alone. Mr. Arnaud's not here, I can't let you see his daughter. We've already questioned her. We can question her as many times as we like. That's up to Mr. Arnaud. Can we talk to Mrs. Arnaud? She's sick and can't be disturbed. Lucien! Let me decide what I can and can't do. Show them in. Hélène, Mr. and Mrs. Thomas saw you. Where were you going? You were meeting a boy and don't want your parents to know? If that's it, I won't tell a soul. Who's the Romeo? You won't say? Let's take a different tack, you and me. Let me explain something to you. We could have you examined by a doctor. See what I mean? Answer my question. -Are you a virgin? -None of your business. Fine... Go tell her mother. -She's going to the doctor. -No! -Please! -Are you a virgin or not? Guess that means no. We're getting somewhere. The night of the fair, you were out fooling around? With who? If it's some little brat, tell us his name. And we'll leave you alone. Promise. She says nothing, it means she was with her teacher. -Is that it? -Yes. What's going on? What's my daughter got to do with this? -Ask her. -Ask her what? -What she just told us. -What was it? -Well? -She slept with her teacher. Are you nuts? Sorry, but it's true. Is it true? Yes, Dad. Robert! What's going on? Your daughter's a whore and I'm going to kill that Doucet! We still have some questions for you. Hélène, what's going on? Mr. Doucet? It's Hélène Arnaud, please be careful. My dad just left here with an ax handle. To hit you with, because of me. I'm sorry! Before you hit me with that ax handle, tell me why. Are you putting me on, you bastard? I'm not putting you on, I'm quite serious. One more step and I'll shoot. All right, what did I do now? The Roussel girl wasn't enough for you? You had to screw my daughter? This makes no more sense than the last time. But if you really think I'd be capable of doing that, go ahead. Hit me. What are you waiting for? -The guy's crazy! -Stop! Don't be stupid! -No! -He's crazy! I never said I wasn't on that road. You admit it! -Did you meet Hélène Arnaud? -No, I told you. -You didn't have a date? -Absolutely not, detective. I made him go out that night. Remember, Jean? We had a discussion that morning. You're not dressed! Not coming to the fair? The Châteauneuf fair's been the same for the last 10 years. You don't need me to photograph the kids you see every day. No, but I'd like you to come. -Everyone would. -Think so? I'm not as popular as you. You're so at home with these people. I resent you for it. For loving the children? For liking it here? Of liking this hick town, losing all your ambition... -Becoming like them. -What's gotten into you? Are you that unhappy here? What do you need? A change, to live somewhere else. Pay no attention, I'm just tired. Don't miss the parade. Know what time it is? -The fireworks start soon. -I'm staying here. Why? I thought about what you said. Let's not start making compromises. I know you're dying to go. So go. Forget about what I said. All I care about is that you're happy. Go up on the hill and take some nice pictures. -And you? -I'll have a delightful time. The Bayreuth Festival's on TV, I know how much it bores you. It's pure selfishness. That's why the Thomases saw me on the Chastenay road. I photographed the fireworks from the hill. Here's the proof. It's possible to take a few pictures, and engage in other activities in between. -What I said means nothing? -Not much. You're his wife, you can't testify under oath. Come in. Doucet... Do you still claim that Catherine Roussel stole -that picture? -Yes! The problem is she also has a picture of you in a swimsuit. -You're out of control. -It can't be! Isn't this you? Yes. Josette... Tell us how Mr. Doucet gave you the picture. My dad gave me some meat for Mrs. Doucet. I came up, but Mrs. Doucet wasn't here. But Mr. Doucet was. He led me to his room to look at pictures, and gave me one. But when he gave you the picture, -you said he kissed you. -Yes. -Several times. -That's it? -He touched me too. -All over, you said? All over. Enough! Get out of here, you understand? Get out of here! I've brought you all together because the police are about to arrest Mr. Doucet. It's very serious. What he did was very serious, if he actually did it. But also the consequences. You may not know it, but this'll end up in court. Know what Mr. Doucet could face? Hard labor for life. Did you hear that? Hard labor for life! I just wanted you to know. The parents, and the girls too. Are you all sure you're not mistaken? -We never said he raped her. -We said he tried. Same thing! Articles 332 and 333 of the penal code... It says so right here: "Even attempted sexual assault, if violence is involved..." Which is the case. "...by a teacher on one of his students under 15 years old, shall be sentenced to hard labor for life." Have you thought about it carefully? Josette? Hélène? Catherine? The Roussels? Arnaud? The Monniers? You're leading the witnesses. I'm keeping them informed! You won't retract your accusations? Fine. Take Mr. Doucet away. Excuse me. Lowlife! One gold lighter. One pair of black shoelaces. One black belt. One black tie. One gold wedding band. I know you won't mind Catherine returning to class. Just because your husband... Of course, it's what I'd expect. Hello, Catherine. Hello. This can't interfere with her graduation. -It's important. -She'll be treated -like everyone else. -I hope so. Class is starting. Good-bye, Mrs. Roussel. Good-bye. Recreation's over! -What are you in for? -Jumping a little girl. You could always try jumping the wall! I'm no idiot, I'm trying to be absolutely thorough. I know what kids are capable of, I know the risks of teaching. I read the papers and watch TV. If it was just Catherine or Hélène or Josette, I'd believe they're lying. But the 3 accusations are unrelated. -Why would all 3 lie? -In my cell, I go over and over it in my head. Was it something I said, something I did? I can't think what. I'm telling the truth, I swear. Your Honor, do I look like a degenerate to you? Look at this guy. He looks like a decent guy. Last month, right where you're sitting, he admitted killing his wife and kid to marry his mistress. "When I got there, Mr. Doucet didn't say anything. He came toward me, looking at me, then took me in his arms and kissed me. Then he touched my breasts and under my skirt. He made me lie down next to him on the floor and we had sexual relations." Is that what you told the police? Yes, sir. When Mr. Doucet made a date with you, what did he say? -He wanted to talk to me. -About what? He didn't say. What did you think? It was about my school work. It seemed normal to talk about school work in the forest the night of the fair? It didn't surprise you? It did, a little. Why did you go? I don't know. If another man had made a date like that with you, -would you have gone? -No, sir. -Were you in love with him? -No, sir. When he touched you, did you fight back? -No. -Why not? -You were surprised? -Yes. -First time it had happened? -Yes. When he pushed you to the floor, did you fight back? Yell? Hit him? Bite him? No. I don't get it, Your Honor. A girl with a good reputation, who doesn't hang out with boys, who isn't in love with Doucet, gives in to him without fighting back. Why? -Did he hit or threaten you? -No. Why did you give in to him? Were you afraid of him? Because he was the teacher? Yes. -You were afraid to fight back? -Yes, sir. There it is. Satisfied? Your client abused his authority as a teacher. Which more than justifies the harsh provisions of Article 333. What do you have to say? Hélène, look at me. Of all the students I've ever taught, you're the only one I thought incapable of lying. Now you're lying, falsely accusing me. Want me to go to jail? -Why are you lying? -I'm not lying. -Look at me. -Do you swear? -I swear. You're not making yourself look more innocent. Go back to your cell. We'll continue the investigation when you've calmed down. -Take him away. -Your Honor! Please understand, my client acted out of indignation, -which indicates innocence. -Or proves guilt. Maybe he's no more capable of controlling himself here than with an innocent young girl in the woods. Lucien, do the payroll, I'm going to Louviers! Yes, boss. -Caroli! -Here. -Alliote! -Yes. -Valdez! -Yes. -Lavissère! -Yes. -Jacky! -Yeah. -Kapenski! -Yes. Robert! Renequin! -Gaudet! -Thanks. I'm glad you confided in me, Mrs. Doucet. You mustn't think I blame you. It's not your fault. I feel sorry for you. I'm also envious. You love your husband enough to trust him in spite of everything. I know he didn't do it, and I'll prove it. -Please help me. -I'd like to, but how? Let me talk to Hélène, I know her. She's sensitive, generous and loyal. She must have a reason for lying, and I want to find out. Try, but I'm not sure you'll get anywhere. I questioned her, but she wouldn't tell me. Aggression aside, she's just like her dad: stubborn, inflexible and rigid. Hélène, honey, Mrs. Doucet wants to... Go away! Leave me alone! Did you know about Hélène's date with Mr. Doucet? No, ma'am. She didn't say anything the night of the fair? No. -On the way home? -No. You didn't ask her? Yes, she said it was none of my business. You have no idea what she was planning to do, where and with whom? No, ma'am. How could 2 best friends like you hide something like that? That's enough! One more question, please, Mrs. Canet. If you knew nothing, why did you tell the police she was with you at the fair? When and where did she say that? They didn't question her! At city hall, after they questioned Hélène. -How do you know? -I looked at the file. Is it true? Answer me! The judge will ask you the same question. You lied in order to protect Hélène. You knew something. Stop crying and answer! What did you know? -I knew Hélène had a date. -She told you? -Yes. -With who? With Mr. Doucet? Yes. In order for me to understand this case, I'll need to clear up certain details. You can help me, but I'll have to be indiscreet in front of your husband, since you insisted he be present. I'm ready, Your Honor. Are your and your husband's marital relations... Normal? Yes, Your Honor. What's that got to do with it? How could our relations affect the case? The judge is right. He wants to know if I display a certain coldness in bed that might explain the offences you're accused of. But since we're condemned to live in a tiny village, there isn't much else to do. Since we don't yet have children, it's like compensation for me. Please, madam. I'm answering your question. Yes, Your Honor, we have sex as often as anyone else, and the same way. My sexual perversion only comes out with my students. To your knowledge, has your husband had any affairs? If he had, the whole village would have told you. Do you know Martine Augier? Yes, a former student. From how far back? 6 or 7 years. -Have you seen her since? -Why, did I rape her too? A witness saw you together in Louviers, going into her house. You seemed very much in love, your arms full of wine and food. Did you know about this? Yes, Your Honor. Finally a story I can explain. If you think Martine Augier has been my mistress since she was in school, you'll be disappointed. Martine has a little brother, Philippe. Children, keep it down! Don't wake up Mr. Augier! He's napping in class. Quiet! Sleeping on us now, Philippe? Come show me what you know. Come on! Hurry! Tell me how it felt, son. I felt like throwing up and the room was spinning, my head too. -Do you still feel like that? -Less. Move your head. Are you dizzy? It's OK. -Has this happened before? -Never. Even when he was younger? No, I had him when he was 5 and he was never sick. Tonsillitis and the measles, like the other kids. -Feeling better, Philippe? -Yeah. -Thanks, doctor. -You're welcome. -Keep us posted? -Absolutely. -What's wrong with him? -I don't know. Don't worry, I'm sure it's not serious. -Hello, doctor. -Hello, Mr. Doucet. And matches. -How's young Philippe? -Not well. I've been wanting to talk to you. The boy has something in his brain. Maybe a tumor. But to know for sure, I'd have to do tests, take X-rays and perform exploratory surgery. But his father won't let me. He, his wife and the neighbors are convinced the boy's nausea and dizziness are due to worms. They're giving him worm powder! Strange as it may seem, I'm helpless. It's the law: Kids have to go to school, but not to the hospital. What can you do? His father's a laborer. Hospitals aren't free like schools, it's not fair. We can't let him die because his father's a jerk or the law isn't fair! I agree, but what can I do that you and the doctor can't? Augier's a blockhead. Even de Gaulle couldn't convince him. Unless the general provided a subsidy. You say there's a lot of money involved? Unfortunately. There might be a way out. Remember Martine, the eldest Augier? She was a student of yours, a smart girl. Moved to town, runs a little clothing boutique, I think. Seems to be doing well. Go see her. Now you have a new head, I hope you'll work hard. Yes, sir, I promise. -When can I go home? -The doctor said next week. -And to Châteauneuf on Saturday. -This Saturday? No, in a week, not too long. Just in time for the fair. The fireworks will be special. Now let's have lunch in Philippe's honor, my treat. -Lunch is on me, I insist. -No! I'd really like to! I was never a good student, but I'm a great cook. -OK? -OK. That's all that happened between Martine Augier and me: Her brother's illness, operation and convalescence. Then I'll hear Martine Augier. I can't decide which one! I found another style. I usually just buy the same bra as last time. It's huge! Sure it's my size? Am I that fat? This one looks quite good. No, I need something different, it's for a wedding. Not mine, my niece's. Under a dress, you can't tell the difference. MRS. DOUCET'S HERE. MEET ME IN THE BAR DES SAISONS. Sorry, Martine, I feel so alone. In Châteauneuf, they all treat me like a widow. I can't take it! Sometimes I lose faith, even in him. You can't think that! Not you! Why are they all accusing him? Catherine, Hélène, Josette and now Brigitte! Can you tell me why? You know, young girls get strange ideas. Big girls too. They're all lying! I see them sitting there looking innocent, and I want to slap them! They're like a brick wall, it drives me crazy. Are you expecting someone? It doesn't matter. Where were you the night of the fair? I brought Philippe to my parents', then came home. -Before nightfall? -Yes. You spent the evening alone? Yes. If you told them you spent that night with my husband, -no one would know. -That's perjury! I know it's serious. But Jean's innocent and could get hard labor for life. It's been too long, the judge won't believe me. It doesn't matter, it's to confuse Hélène. If she changes her story, we win. Please do it! I can't, I'd do anything but that. It's not that I'm scared of the law. Come here. Look. See? The store, this place... It's all him. Philippe's operation too. I was poor and didn't want to rot away in Châteauneuf. you don't need to explain. Your husband would have to agree to the perjury, but since he's innocent, he'd refuse. I'm about to lose my mind. I want to bang my head against the wall to get it over with. Or kill someone, anyone. A guard...or the judge. Just to have a reason for being here. You know... Sometimes I think I should have accepted Baudoin's offer. To run away. Know what? I even thought of Martine. If she claimed she was with me that night, the judge would have no reason not to believe her. Her word's as good as Hélène's. Yet another lie! I couldn't do that. There'd always be a doubt. Even in your mind, and I don't want that. What I want is the truth. Brigitte, stop copying! What good does it do you? Try to do it yourself. Stop hanging off coattails. If he's wrong, you'll make the same mistake. In life, when you have a decision to make, will you get someone else to make it for you? Will you get your friends to choose your fiancé? At your wedding, will you ask Hélène what to say? Close your books. We'll look at some history. Today we'll talk about the famous Calas affair. Jean Calas was a Toulouse shopkeeper who was unjustly accused on the basis of lies of killing his son. He was sentenced to death and tortured on the rack, a very painful torture. No, stop! It wasn't him! It's not true! Stop! Don't do it! Lucien, wake up, it's Brigitte! It's OK, honey! You had a nightmare. Hélène lied, and so did I! What was that? She wasn't with Mr. Doucet that night. Then who? Miguel. Miguel? The Portuguese guy? -Yes. -What Portuguese guy? Worked at the quarry. But he was only here for one day! That's the day it started. -What the hell are you doing? -It's the spark plugs. Should have called me! There are 8 guys doing -nothing at the worksite! -We tried to fix it! Try later! Boost the Jeep! You! Help us! Are you deaf? Can't you hear? Answer when I call! Go over there! -Who's that guy? -Portuguese guy, started today. He can't speak French. I gather he can work stone, so I'll put him in the quarry. We'll see. Hurry! That's enough! Move! A few days later, Hélène and I went to the quarry. Thank you. Are you doing OK? Not too bored here? No understand. Alone? Here? Not alone. Night...alone... She didn't talk about Miguel. I knew something was up. -Where are you going? -Shopping. -I'll come too. -I'll be gone 5 minutes. Brigitte, listen to me. If you ever repeat what you just said, Mr. Arnaud's temper will have nothing on mine! Understand? Don't talk about it to Hélène! Swear! Yes, Dad. -What'll you do? -Send the Portuguese packing. If Arnaud knew she was with a Portuguese, he'd kill him! There's enough trouble. Get up! Hélène, get it? Today we're supposed to go over all this. Lucien, do the payroll, I'm going to Louviers. Yes, boss. He'll get what he's owed too. Stay out of it. -Caroli! -Here. -Alliote! -Yes. -Valdez! -Yes. -Lavissère! -Yes. -Jacky! -Here. -Kapensky! -Yes. Robert! -Renequin! -Renequin, where are you? Gaudet! Where are you going? Where else? The quarry! Hélène! Stop! Don't be stupid! Your Portuguese friend's gone. I drove him to the station. Your father can't know you went out. No one around must know who the Arnaud girl slept with. I can see why you'd rather say it was your teacher. Get in! Hélène! Mrs. Arnaud, Hélène and I got a weight off our shoulders, her because she told the truth, and me because I finally know it. I want you to know I'm not mad at you. I was also ready to lie for the man I love. -Why did she make it up? -Why? You're asking why? No one can tell you anything! She's scared of you, everyone is. Not for herself, for that boy. And that idiot downstairs! He was scared too! Why? Do you know? He tells me the Portuguese guy left on his own. Does he think I'm such an asshole? That I wouldn't drag my daughter before the courts? This is all very well, but how does it help Doucet? There's still Catherine Roussel and Josette Monnier. I'll replace the blouse, I want it to be authentic. Go ahead if you think it's best. What is this, a rape or a first communion? Don't smile, think about what he did to you. Good. One more. It's over. You don't have to leave, but I have to get her dressed. The reconstruction's in an hour and I'm not ready. Take this off. Try to make us proud. Keep your finger out of your nose! If you do well, you'll get a bicycle. Mr. Roussel, can we get a comment? Don't waste your time. Please, Mr. Roussel! Not nice making her go through that again. If I were Doucet, I'd have gone for the mother instead. Now, Doucet, show us your version of what happened. It's very simple. I walked toward her with her workbook. I asked her why she hadn't done the problem. She talked back to me, said things like studying was useless. Then I brought up the lighter and the picture. About the lighter, she denied it. She gave me the picture. I hung it on the board. She picked up her things and left. That's it, Your Honor. Your turn, Catherine. What should I do? Tell us in detail what happened. Don't leave anything out, if you can. Mr. Doucet came close to me, like now. He put my notebook down and talked about the problem. But after, that's not what happened. He sat down here and I moved over. -Go sit down, Doucet. -No, Your Honor. I'm a teacher, not an actor. Lambert, stand in. Then Mr. Doucet brought up the picture he gave me. He said I had to give it to him because everyone knew. Including Mrs. Doucet. You gave him the picture? Where was it? -In my binder. -Carry on. I gave him the picture and he said he'd give me another, later, then he kissed me. Kissed you how? First here, while saying things to me. What things? That I was nice and pretty and he liked me. Then he pulled me towards him. I was scared because he held me too tight. He kissed me on the mouth and touched me all over. I fought back, hit him, fell off the bench and ran for the door. Your Honor, I think you'll agree that this reconstruction, or rather this account, doesn't add anything to either case, Mr. Doucet's denial of the events or the case of a little girl with too much imagination and lots of acting talent. In any case... Excuse me. Your Honor... Everything Catherine Roussel just told you... ...is true. If you'll allow it, I'd like to start the scene over. I'll play my part this time. Is it really necessary? I want to do it. May I? Take your place, Catherine. I come towards you. I put the notebook on the desk and sit next to you. Move over. You give me the picture. I say things to you. I throw myself on you and hold you tight. I kiss her on the mouth and touch her breasts. I'm losing control, she's fighting back. Catherine. You forgot your things. Mrs. Roussel... Did Catherine have her binder with her that day? Catherine! I don't know, I can't remember. She did, Jean, I'm sure of it. Catherine, honey! Did you make the whole thing up? -Yes, Daddy. -Why? A little brat has my picture and it's none of my business? What about your parents? Pick up your things. We'll go to your house and find that picture! Come on! Here, I don't want it. Did you steal it to give your friends a thrill? They can all enjoy it. Now everyone can enjoy it. Get out of here! Go play with dolls and do your homework. Lose that scowl if we're to be friends again. No good-bye? Because of that? And because of Hélène. You thought she was involved with my husband. You were jealous. Why did you think that? -Seen Hélène? -Just got here. -Why? -I can't find her. Her Majesty got rid of her lackey! The queen and her servant! She'd never have found Hélène, know where she was? No. In the woods. -With who? -Can't you guess? Mr. Doucet. -It's not true. -It sure is! Ask Annette, she saw him. You and your picture! How did you get the picture? Catherine, look at this picture of the teacher naked. He's ugly like this. You're saying that because he doesn't notice you. Quickly! Josette, could you give me that picture? Swap me for your transistor. -What'll I tell my parents? -That's your problem. OK. So you actually had 2 pictures of Mr. Doucet? Yes, sir. Do you still claim Mr. Doucet gave them to you? No, sir. -Did you steal them? -I didn't steal them! I found them. Come in! -Hello, is Mrs. Doucet here? -She's at the dressmaker's. -This is from dad. -Put it on the kitchen counter. Yes, sir. Everything you told us about Mr. Doucet kissing you and touching you was made up? -Yes, sir. -Why? You wanted something to happen to you too, like to Catherine and Hélène? Yes. Nothing ever happens to me. Suzanne... Something good's come of all this. We're leaving. I'll never sit here again. There he is! Mr. Doucet, I have something to tell you. What is it, honey? I gave you the lighter. You gave me the lighter? Why? Because you saved Philippe from dying. Why didn't you tell me? I couldn't, I took the money from dad's till. Will you be back tomorrow? Yes, son, he will. You kids... If you don't work hard, watch out! Watch out! Thanks to Ralle1 the original uploader. Synchronisation for rough version rip by HookyB.
