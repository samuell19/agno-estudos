Tamako! Let's have some fun! We brought fireworks! What's wrong? Are you embarrassed? Oh, you look young! How old are you? - Do you want to know? - Yeah. I'm fifteen. LIKE A SAVAGE Hiroko Yakushimaru Kyohei Shibata Written and Directed by: Toru Kawashima Here we go. Okay! Fireworks remind me of a phrase, "Hanabi like vie." [Hanabi = fireworks.] "Hanabi like bi"? You mean they're beautiful? [Bi = beauty.] No. Vie is a French word. Vie, as in "c'est la vie." It means life. Nice pronunciation. I'm a French major, you know. Fireworks like life.... How wistful. - Just what I'd expect from a writer. - Come on! I read it in high school — in a textbook or something. I think it was a short story by Ryunosuke Akutagawa. During the Meiji Era, a French officer came to provide technical guidance. One night, he saw the fireworks display at Ryogoku Bridge and said, "Hanabi like vie." [Fireworks like life.] That phrase really made an impression on me. French is the best for that kind of thing. You'd all groan if I said, "That's life!" in Japanese. "C'est la vie," on the other hand... It's perfect. Ei-chan! Eiji! Hello? Is that you, Eiji? You're alone, right? You hear me? Listen carefully. The boss got shot. That's right. Anyway, come here as soon as possible. No way! You have to come alone! Why? I'll explain when you get here. When I was fifteen, my first novel got a lot of attention. They said I was a prodigy. You were so nonchalant about it. I was impressed. Thank you very much. But, really, I was just a know-it-all. I thought I understood everything. But, as the years went by, I found there were things I didn't understand, after all. I was so happy to realize that. I know what you mean. Even now, sometimes I feel like I don't understand anything. Although, recently, I've started feeling like there's something I did understand. Even when I was fifteen, or sixteen, or seventeen, I think I really did understand. Tamako. Yes? You shouldn't be so hard on yourself. Understood. Sorry to keep you waiting! Brother... Mr. Takeguchi... Mr. Takeguchi! Mr. Takeguchi... Is that you, Eiji? Are you all right? I'm fine. The boss got hit, though. Who did it? I have no idea. It was quick. There was a deal tonight. The boss went to see a girl afterwards. I was waiting for him outside... You can see how that turned out... One more thing — I need to ask you a favor... There's a bag in the back room. Did you find it? You mean this? Yeah. What's inside? Guns. Pistols. I can't get mixed up in a war between yakuza families. It's too much for me. Stop complaining. Take it easy. Do what you always do. That's it. It would be a waste if the police took them, right? It's business. Just business. I'll call you later. Now, go. Wait 30 minutes, no, wait 15 minutes, and then call the cops. Thirty minutes or maybe an hour? I'm just going out to feel the breeze. Go ahead. But are you sure you're okay? You drank too much. I'm okay, I'm okay. I'm not drunk at all. By the way, Tamako, it's almost your birthday, right? What? Well, not quite. Didn't you say your birthday was at the end of August. Is that true? Be sure to enjoy yourselves. It's a little early, but let's celebrate your birthday. Just don't start singing "Happy Birthday." Eiji! Hi! - Are you still working? - I'm done already. My client was a yakuza. - Huh? - He was a yakuza. You should be careful. See you. He was with a woman! We're the ones who got hit! Why are those bastards hassling us? Hello? How are you? This is Hirosawa. Yes, just a moment. It's from the head office. Hello? This is Ichijo. Sorry, not yet... The head office will handle this for the time being. Understood? Call Yoshimoto. Yes, we'll deal with it. Send over Takeguchi instead. I know that. I don't want a war either. But one of my guys got killed. He was the leader of a gang, even if it was a small one. I just want things to be set right. Yes, I'm counting on you. What would you like to drink? - Beer. - Sure. Tamako! What have you been up to today? I snuck out to find adventure in the night. That's so cool! I want to have a night adventure, too! - How are you? - Okay. - You look great. I have a gift for you. - What is it? I used them for today's shoot. To Eiji Nakai Eiji, how are you? Long time no see! I'm fine, fine, "very fine!" It's either you or Ichijo. I'm talking about Yamanishi's successor. Come on, tell me now. About the woman. Tell me about her. Aside from you, she was the only one who knew Yamanishi was there, right? So, tell me about her. I'm sure you, at least, remember her age and the clothes she was wearing. You're not stupid. She was about 20 years old... She wore white clothes... Polka dots... She was also wearing white trousers. A hat, too... She wore a hat? Yes... Ouch! Hey, you! Wait! Hold on, will you? Hold on right there! It's rude to push someone and walk away without saying anything. Hey! What the hell are you doing? What does that mean? Just take it. Apologize to me. It's okay, just take the money. What gives you the right to order me around? Who do you think you are? Okay, miss high-and-mighty who the hell are you, then? You're just some belligerent drunk. Hey, hey! Who the hell you think you are? Why are you touching me? Nice to meet you. I'm Takeshi. She's cute! She may be cute, but she's tough. Oh, isn't a strong girl a nice thing? Watch out for this guy — he's a heel. And a savage as well. - About that thing before... - That? Just business. - I see. - What kind of work do you do? I'm in the service business, international trade. That's surprisingly honestly work. I was imagining something more unsavory. Like a yakuza. What's so funny? Welcome! Welcome! Oh, some of your work associates are here. So, what kind of work do you do? You can guess. Well, I don't think you're a student. You stay where you are. Hi. Is she your girl? Well, kind of... Something's fishy. Yeah, I smell a rat. You're coming with us. Give me a break, will you? We're not fooling around! Hey, go to the bathroom. Why? Quick, do what I say. But why? Hurry up. Wait! Don't move! There's a line! Please wait your turn. - Get away! - Ouch, stop! What a strong man! Fantastic! Open up! Bill him for the repair costs on that door! Now that's a knock! I'm leaving! That door wasn't free, you know. What the hell was that? What do we do? I don't know either. Anyway... Let's go! Let go of my hand! It's easier to run that way. Can you run? I'm no olympian. Good enough. It's been a long time since I ran like this! This feels... great, doesn't it? You sound like you're out of breath. It's harder than it looks. Your lifestyle is catching up with you. Same for the guys chasing us, I imagine. Damn it! Nope. They must be the type to go jogging every morning. Who are these guys? Health-nut yakuza? They aren't giving up. Why do I have to run away with you? I have no idea! But it looks like you're the one they're after. Why? There's a bar nearby called Presso. Got it? Let's split up here. I'll distract them. I'll see you at Presso. Go! Hurry up! "Fireworks like life." Okay. Thank you for your hard work. Yes, please do. I'll be here for a while. You can go now. Sorry to call you in while you're injured. It's nothing. Well then, I'll be leaving now. They found the woman. The woman. The one you told me about. Oh, is that so? She was with some punk called Eiji. But she got away. - Eiji? - Yeah. That guy who acts like a bodyguard for prostitutes? All right, he must know where she is. Just bring him in. Don't kill him. Hey, let's go! It's fine, it's fine. Take it easy, okay? That idiot... Why would he do this? Did it happen at 11 o'clock? She's saying it happened for an hour and a half starting at 11:00. - That's why... - Excuse me... I do not understand English! Excuse me! Hey, you over there, please have a seat. Please tell us your name and profession. - Well, about that... - What? Can you please be quiet? You're the one making the complaint, so tell us your name and place of work. I can't talk about my job. If you can't talk about your job, we can't make a report I'll see you at Presso. Like hell you will. What are you doing, Tamako? You're definitely mixed up in something criminal. I know. Sorry to keep you waiting. I'm sorry. You smell nice. Twice is too much for one night. Let me return this to you... Why were they chasing us? You're better off not knowing. I'll walk you to your car. I had a good time, actually. You don't have to pretend. You're right. See you. Shit! You bastard! You're a member of Takeguchi's group. Why? You bastard! Get in the car! - Are you all right? - Yeah... Is there a hospital I can take you to? No doctors. Why? Please, let's not have this conversation. Okay. Can you give me a cigarette? Why are you laughing? Because we're still together. That's right. I had a feeling things would turn out this way. I wish you had told me — you could have saved me some pain. What? Are you in pain? Look ahead! Be careful! Will you give me another cigarette? Isn't smoking bad for your injuries? I'm trying to blow smoke out from my wounds. Cut it out! I'm sorry. I'm ashamed of myself. There's nothing to be embarrassed about. I'd probably be throwing up right now, if only I could walk to the toilet. I did what I could for your wounds. Right. You should get some rest... Right. Good morning! It's Tuesday, right? Of course it is! How's work coming along? - Not too bad. - I see! I'll cook you something nice. Aunt, I don't need anything today. Why? I thought I should try cooking for myself sometimes. Oh, I see. In that case, at least let me tidy up your room. Ah, you don't need to. How come? I get it! I don't want to intrude. I'm glad for you. See you. I'll come again next week. - I'm sorry. - It's fine, it's fine. I'm happy for you. Be sure to eat properly, okay? The fireworks party was a little anti-climactic this year, huh? Here are the leftover fireworks. Set them off when you get writer's block. Cheer up, will you? No one is a pro at life. Everyone is an amateur. I forget who said that. Makiko. Can you get me some water? Are you awake? Yeah... Just a minute. Here it is! Benzalkonium chloride... benzethonium chloride... Oxytetracycline hydrochloride... chloramphenicol... As a representative of Hinose city council, working to develop Shonan... I've had enough. Yakuza Boss Yamanishi Shot to Death Are you already awake? What are you reading? Nothing... You look young. Give me a break. After 7:00 PM - Roppongi Apartment Kanto Nishiki Rengokai Yakuza Wow... You have good intuitions. It's more deduction than intuition. Is something wrong? No, I'm just impressed. What do you plan to do from now on? I'll think about it. You sure are a strange girl. Most people would be scared. I am scared. - Really? - Yes! Are you all right? I had a lot of dreams while I was asleep. I could always hear the sound of waves between one dream and the next. What did you dream about? I forget. Can I have a cigarette? Sorry, but you can't. Shall we drink some booze? We can't! Who is it? Eiji? I had a bad dream... Looks like we're having yakitori for breakfast today. You savage! Can I ask you a favor? That's right. The key is inside. Yeah... much appreciated. I can't go — someone in a jeep is coming to meet you. That's right. You idiot, that's not what I mean. See you. I have a favor to ask you. I get it. With the power of young people in local politics, we can make Hinose City a better place... Don't you remember? - No... - Well. You were at Presso one night about a week ago, right? Presto... Oh yeah, that's right. I was there, too. I was watching you the whole time. I was thinking, "What a cute girl." Sorry, I don't mean to be rude to someone older. Thank you for the compliment. As for you... By the way, could you tell Eiji something I forget to mention on the phone? I was the woman with that yakuza who got killed. You?! Pretty bad, right? Don't tell anyone, okay? I don't want to get involved. You slept with him? It's business. Just business. - I know, right? - Today was so much fun! I'm really tired! They're so obnoxious. How old are you? Do you want to know? Yes... I'm fifteen. If each pistol sells for 500.000 yen, the whole lot could be worth 6.000.000. That's a lot of money. It's chump change for yakuza these days. You know a lot about yakuza. Sure, sweetie, and you know a lot about big words. Don't call me sweetie! I'm leaving tomorrow. What should I call you? I've never been with a novelist before. How do I put this into words? Tomorrow? Yeah. I see... What should I call you? I'm okay with sweetie. Can you really cook? I'm no five-star chef. Looks like your injuries are healing. How do you know that? You've started talking a lot. Cut it out! Hello? Yamaguchi Industries. Is that you, Eiji? Where are you now? First, can you tell me what's going on? A mistake? I don't like getting stabbed because of a mistake. I trusted you. Hate to break it to you, but I'm fed up with gangsters. I'm taking the guns as compensation for my injuries. Eiji, listen very carefully. Wait where you are, before we need to do something drastic. For the future of Shonan, and the future of Hinose City… Mayor Hatoda is giving it 100 percent... Unfortunately, I've already made up my mind. Is that so? Yes... yes... I can't tell you how unfortunate that is. He's such a fool. What the hell is he thinking? Food's ready. Let's eat! Surprise! You know... I feel like I'm in another world here. I never thought something like this would happen. Wait here for a second. I read your novel today while I was waiting for you to return. I've never spent so much time reading a book before. What did you think? It's hard to explain... But it was good. Lots of big words, though. I feel a bit tired. I can't... Are you asleep? What is it? Can you open the door? But... We only just met... What did you say? I want to show you something. The clips are full of drugs. I didn't notice. They're already doing one shady deal — might as well kill two birds with one stone. No bullets, of course. Wait, look at this. He killed his boss and shot himself to make it look like rivalry between yakuza groups. Then, he put the pistol in that bag, mixed together with all the other guns. That's quite a story, even for the yakuza. Mistaken identities, assumptions, meddling.... One misunderstanding leading into the next... Eiji! Mr. Takiguchi? Is that you, Mr. Takiguchi? Takiguchi! Don't do it... Come on! Stop it, I beg you! It's too dark to see anything. Does anybody live close enough to hear a gunshot? That won't work. They'd think we were setting off fireworks again. Wait. Open the window. - Why? - Just do it. Stay away! Today is my birthday. What?! Today is my birthday! Ever since I was a little kid, I always hated my birthday. Since it's on August 31st. Whenever my birthday comes, it means summer vacation is about to end. Who'd want to come to a birthday party... on a day like that?! I don't know... What did you say? I don't know my own birthday. Girls are always asking when my birthday is. So, I try to come up with something — April 30th, or December 1st... But any day I choose feels wrong. It's pathetic. I missed. Why aren't they attacking us? It's almost morning. They're waiting for daylight. "Adieu." This is the end of the road. Give me a hand here. A little more... Just a little more. Happy birthday. I'll join you. I've decided that August 31st is my birthday, too. Happy birthday... With twilight darkening blue I was struck by love on that night Before the city starts to glitter Let me kiss you Quick, like a game A song for wicked adults Rings out melancholy and sweet While our romance still has its glamour Let me dance By your side, as if I am lonely What I want to ask you Is the way to forget a lovely romance Or will love be etched into my chest? I'm carried far away Let me sleep Now so that I can forget everything Let me sleep Written and Directed by: Toru Kawashima
