(phone ringing) (phone ringing) Hello? What is it, Joan? Oh, my God. (Celeste voiceover) I want whoever does this to be extremely careful. As careful as I am. (baby cooing) Destroy this before you do the job. This is his office, and there's no exit or entry except on this little street here. And the people in the other buildings can't see who comes or goes. He works Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. (man) How much cash does he keep there? (Celeste) Oh, not enough to make it look like a robbery. I want the police to find drugs. (baby crying over monitor) So, what time are you gonna be home tonight? Early, remember? I'm gonna take you out for Valentine's dinner. Just the two of us. Okay, deal. (barking) (man) So you think they'll figure it was a drug deal gone bad. (Celeste) If you do it right. Buddy, come on, let's go. (Celeste) I want you to shoot him in the head. When you walk out, I want him dead, not just wounded. (horn honks) (man) Oh, I'll make sure it's done right. Hey, you. Hi. (man) You gonna stay this cool if the police question you? (Celeste) I'm a well-known woman prominent in the community. Who would think I had anything to do with it? When I have proof that he's dead and I see the story published in the papers, I'll pay you the rest. Just call me and say, hmm... "The carpet's been cleaned." That's all I need to hear. Oh, oh, oh, how soon? (man) Soon, soon. (phone ringing) (line ringing) (phone ringing) Don't! (phone ringing) (line ringing) Look, um, I got a wife and a new kid, okay? So you guys, you just take whatever you want. All right? Shut up! Hey, they're ready for you in the cath lab. (phone rings, stops) Come on! Come on, move, move! Move! Let's go! (gunshot) (clatters to floor) (applause) Thank you. Thank you all for being here. Celeste Cooper is a graduate of Washington University where she was honored for her achievements as a young writer. She gave up a promising career to devote herself to being a wife and a mother. Having known Celeste for the past five years, I can tell you that she's shown the same devotion to serving... Hi. Hi. I knew you'd make it. You look beautiful. Thank you, Daddy. (Joan) The Handicapped Children's Foundation's Woman of the Year: Celeste Cooper! (cheering and applause, music plays) Congratulations. Proud of your mother? Who wouldn't be? Thank you. (Joan) Laurel, isn't that the dress your mother bought for you? Hi. Yes, she's too much. Good to see you. I told her she shouldn't have. Well, of course she should have. What mother wouldn't want the best for her daughter? You won't forget about the things we need for her tribute album? No, I already talked to Dad about the photos and news clippings. And I'm going to call her college, find out more about that writing award. There you are. Late for your own mother's dinner. Honey, how many times have I told you not to work so hard? Or was one of those doctors trying to ask you out again? (chuckling) Frank, how are you? How's business? Holly... Show them, darling. (appreciative responses) Laurel? Landed an investment banker. Hooray for Holly. That's great. You look very happy. Oh, how lovely for you, darling. So, I'm so thirsty, George. Do you think you could get me something to drink? Hey, Laurel, you need a ride? Thanks, I have my own car. Well, then, um... How about dinner tomorrow? I don't think so. I've been really busy with work and... Next time, right? Maybe. I can hardly wait to meet the man who's gonna make an impression on you. (chuckles) What's so funny? You know, maybe Daddy and I should have bought you a bigger condo. If we'd known you'd wanted a roommate-- Mom, I barely have time to date these days anyway. Exactly. And that is why I'm here. No, no, no, no, not a another fix-up. Yes, yes, yes. No! Come on, just listen. A personal ad? Yes, just listen, okay? "Nice up and coming businessman wants to meet equally smart, attractive woman. No way, forget it! There's no way I'm gonna answer one of these things! Oh, come on. Okay. (door closes) If that's the way you feel about it. (phone rings) Hello. Yes... Just a second. Oh, phone for you. Who is it? I don't know, mmm, Ted somebody, something. This is Laurel Cooper. Hi, I'm, um, I'm Ted Rogers. Who? You know, the nice guy that you wrote to. Is this a joke? What? Is this a joke? Um, no, the ad, uh, in the paper, that you answered, um... You know, uh, it says you're an attractive, professional woman and you like sports. You're seeking a committed relationship. Does any of this sound familiar to you? Nope, not even vaguely. Well, somebody had to write this letter to me. How else would I get your number? Is the writing really gracefully, sort of curvy... I don't know, um... Yeah, I guess it is, sure. That's my mother's writing. Oh, you're kidding me. Nope, sorry, she wasted your time. Well, no, hang, hang on a minute! What? It says here that you, uh... You like to take long walks. Is that you or is that your mother? No, that's me. That's you? Yup, that's me. You're sure that's you. Yes. It's not your mother? No, it's me. Okay, well... Well, what? Well, let me take you on a long walk. Um... No, I can't-- I can't answer a personal ad. Come on, just meet me, okay? Look, if we do fall in love, your mom can't embarrass you anymore by sending out any more of these stupid letters. (chuckles) Mom! I need to talk to you. Oh, hi, sweetheart. Go ahead. I got a phone call. From Ted Rogers? You answered his ad? He called? Already? You sound like you won a prize. Maybe you did. Maybe he's wonderful. And maybe he's a serial killer. How could you when I told you not to? No, no, you said you wouldn't answer the ad. You never said I couldn't. Well, that was implied! Laurel, these are the best years of your life. Don't let it die on the vine. Are you really that desperate to get me married? Of course not. So what kind of business is he in? I didn't get that far. ♪♪ Oh. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. That's okay, um... Not your type? Ted... Ted Rogers. Yeah. Oh, my God, I'm so embarrassed. No, don't be, I hired him. I pay him to come here and make me look good. Well, it worked. Here. Oh, thank you. You wanna sit down? Yeah. Oh... thanks. You don't look like the kind of guy who'd take out a personal ad. I didn't. But my mother answered an ad in-- That my mother wrote. No way. I was afraid to tell you on the phone 'cause I thought it would just sound too weird, you know? How weird is that? There's actually two of them out there? I'm totally lying to you. No, the truth is I just work long hours, and I don't get a chance to meet people. What do you do? Uh, why don't we order and, uh, if you want, I'll show you after we're done eating. Okay, deal. (Ted) My dad started the place from nothing. He worked days and nights and weekends. Funny thing is when I was a kid, I swore I would rather starve than get grease underneath my fingernails. But when he got sick, I had to drop out of college and... I'm sorry. No, no, don't be, um... I bought the place from him. Let me show you around. So I built up on what he had a little bit. Oh, sorry, it's just my brother's car, watch out. Um... and I managed to buy the place next door, so I'll have room to expand. Let me show you that. I was looking all over for a bigger place when this opened up. There's nearly 3,500 square feet in here. As soon as I get enough cash together, I'm gonna get some new equipment, and I'm gonna hire some more mechanics. It's so big. That's what's so great about it. See, this wall, I'm gonna blow out this whole wall. There's room for five bays in there. And over here, that's where my office is gonna be. Picture it, it's gonna be clean and well-organized with a view of the whole shop. You see, I can really do things right here. I can make my customers happy and I can keep 'em coming back. You know that you have really beautiful eyes? Can I kiss you? Looks like somebody had a good time. I did. He's so much cuter than I expected. And he's smart, funny,... And just really, really nice. There's just one problem. What? I have to admit it to my mother! Well, at least you're going to be able to get it over with quickly. She's already called twice. Oh, and your father dropped that off earlier. Ooh, that must be the stuff he dug up for Mom's tribute album. She's gonna kill us when she finds out. I'm gonna turn in. I am on early tomorrow. Oh, and hey, I'm really happy for you. (chuckles) (phone ringing) Hello? Didn't Lynn tell you I called? No, did you? Okay, so what was he like? Are you sure you want to know? He was wonderful, wasn't he? You just don't want to give me the satisfaction. Okay, yes, he was wonderful. Well, why do you sound so surprised, I told you so. Yeah, you're right. I guess I should've listened. You're welcome. Thank you, Mom. It's my pleasure, sweetheart. So what kind of business is he in? Uh, auto business. Mm-hmm. How soon do I get to meet him? Well, next time I see him, if it feels right... You know, I'll-- I'll bring him by. Promise? I promise! (Joan) So, what's he like? Did she finally land one of those doctors? Oh, better, he's an executive in the automotive business and, according to Laurel, he's doing very well. And that's what you're getting? Oh, of course not. I told you to give me the best you have. The Petite Basque. No, no, no, no, no, the Reblochon. Definitely, the Reblochon. That's a better choice. Thank you. (classical piano playing) He's usually on time. (Celeste) George, don't you smoke that in here. Well, honey, maybe he got held up in a meeting. Was he coming straight from the office? He doesn't exactly work in an office. Oh, office, executive suite, it's all the same. (doorbell chimes) That must be him! Hey, I'm sorry I'm late. I was on my way home to change and, uh... (Celeste) We were beginning to think you weren't coming at all. (chuckling) Mother, this is Ted Rogers. Hi, how you doing? I'm sorry to show up looking like this, but I was on my way home to get dressed and this woman in front of me blew a tire. She had a couple of kids with her so I, you know, I helped her push the car off to the side of the road and change the tire for her. Well, Good Samaritan's are so rare these days. Hi, I'm Laurel's father. Hi, oh, sorry, how 'bout a little elbow? All right. I better get, um, cleaned up first. Uh, luckily I had my change of clothes in the car. Um, can I use your bathroom? Oh, of course. Honey, would you please show him where it is? Man, it's so big. Oh, look at me. Boy, do I feel like a jerk. Don't, you heard her, you're a Good Samaritan. She'll be fine. (George humming) Well, you're not saving it for him anymore, are you? Oh, sweetheart, you must be so disappointed. When he said he was in the auto business, he failed to mention he was at the bottom. He told me what he does, Mom. Well, then I don't understand you. You knew he was a mechanic? He's also a genuinely nice guy. Well, I can see that, but-- Mom... I hope I didn't leave too big of a mess in there. I tried to clean it up and... Oh, I'm sure it's just fine. (Ted sighs) I've been looking forward to meeting you guys all week. You should hear how Laurel talks about you. (chuckles) We have a very special relationship. (Ted) And I owe you a thank you. Well, if it wasn't for that letter you wrote, I never would have met Laurel. And I am just crazy about her. (nervous chuckle) And so are all the doctors she works with. Aren't they, sweetheart? Wasn't that dinner reservation at 7:30? You were sort of late. Maybe we should get going. Oh, well, I don't... I don't know. I-- I think we could stay a little while. No, don't hang out just for us. We know you both have to work tomorrow. Early to bed, early to rise. Good night. Well... maybe we can get to know each other a little better next time. Let's try. She's right, he's a nice guy. Nice? He's a pathological liar. That ad was deliberately misleading. Up and coming businessman, my ass. (George sighs) Oh, my god. Oh, my God! (George) Celeste? Celeste? Hell will freeze over before he touches my daughter. What's his name? That's Buddy. He used to belong to the neighbors. But I would always pretend he was mine. You didn't have a dog growing up? No, my mother didn't want one in the house. Oh, man, you did live a deprived childhood. Mm-hmm. Let's see if we can make that up to you. ♪ Give you everything you need ♪ ♪ To live inside a twisted cage ♪ ♪ Sleep beside an empty rage... ♪ You know, I fell in love with a nurse when I was 13. Oh, yeah? Let me guess. You fell off your skateboard and she made it all better. No, my grandmother was dying. I'm sorry, is that supposed to be romantic? No, seriously, I was, um... I was afraid to go into her hospital room. Well, lots of people are afraid of hospitals. Well, there was this one nurse... And she could tell. And she would take my hand and go in with me. She would sit with me the whole time I was there. She made it all right. That's how I picture you. It's a nice picture. ♪ Don't say you'll stay 'Cause then you'll go away ♪ ♪ Damn I wish I was your lover ♪ ♪ I'll rock you till the daylight comes ♪ ♪ Make sure you are smiling and warm ♪ ♪ I am everything...

Oh, probably not, sweetheart, but I really think we need to talk. It's 11:00! Oh, drinking wine. Here, let me get these for you. Honey, I can understand why you like Ted, but I just wanna make sure Mom? you're seeing the whole picture. Mom, not now. Now I'll admit he's charming, but charming for a purpose. Mom... He did deceive us. Mom, Mom. He told us that he was a successful businessman. His business is successful. Well, even if it is, which you can't be sure of... Honey, is it the kind of business that goes anywhere? (laughing) I mean, honey, all I'm saying is Mom... don't you think he deserves to know Mom... that he doesn't stand a chance. Mom? Mom! What? (whispering) He's in there. Oh! (whispers) Well, we can talk about this later. Honey, I'm sorry I disturbed you. (door opens/closes) (deep exhale) Well, I guess I don't need a college education to figure out that I'm not wanted. Well, I'm sorry, she just... She has ideas. She's disappointed you're not a doctor or a lawyer. Yeah? So am I. It's all right, I understand. If I had a daughter like you, I would want nothing but the best for her, too. Well, we can work on her. She just has to get to know you better. How about dinner? Better yet, I'll bring my mom. Well, it can't hurt. (classical piano playing) My mom's usually on time. (Celeste) It's only been... 30 minutes. She probably got caught in traffic on her way from work. Oh, she's a... Bookkeeper, part-time. Oh, that's nice. I don't know what I'd do without the woman who pays my bills. Neither do I. (chuckling) (Ted) Thank you, Uh, and the wine list too, please? I got it. So red or white? Oh, you should choose... We'll have this. ...Since we don't drink. Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't know. (George) That's okay, no problem. Mom! I'm so sorry I'm late. Hi, honey, oh, you look so nice. You too, Laurel... Hi. Ohh... I'm so excited to meet you. You're just as pretty as Ted said you were. George. Oh, yes, George, hi, hi. How are you? And I'm Celeste. Celeste... It was so nice of you to suggest that I come. I just know we're gonna be good friends. Oh, I'm sure we will. Oh, look, we almost match. (laughing) Yes, it's too bad your husband couldn't join us. (George) Honey... Mom, I told you. Oh, I'm sorry, that's right. You're divorced. I hope it wasn't too difficult for you. Oh, it was tame compared to Ted's. Mom... What? It's ancient history. Uh, maybe we should order, mmm? That's a good idea. (Harriet sighs) Oh, I'm afraid I can't quite... It's all in, um... French. I thought so. Ohh... (chuckles) Oh, no, no, not for me, thank you. Harriet, you take it. Thank you. (all shriek) Oh! I'm so sorry. (George) Here, soda water. Just dip it in soda water, it'll come right out. Oh, that's okay. Yes, oh, Harriet, don't rub, just dab. Okay. (George) Oh, yeah. I'm so sorry. Well, I certainly am glad we got a chance to do this. And to think I was afraid of steering you in the wrong direction. His business sounds a little shady. What? Well, you heard his mother. They don't have money. What's that got to do with anything? Laurel, he paid for the dinner in hundred dollar bills. He's probably a drug dealer. Don't be ridiculous. It's possible his garage is a front for drug business. And maybe Joan's a secret agent for the CIA. Come on, I trust this guy. Yeah, somebody you met from a newspaper ad. You picked him. He drinks. One glass of wine with dinner. Comes from an unstable home. So does half the population. You're his ticket into society. Oh, what society? Ted doesn't think like that. Okay, okay, it's my fault. You've been too sheltered. But I predict he'll try to rush you into marriage before you get to know him. After all, he's already been in one marriage. What's another? Come on, Mom, we're just having fun. Just having fun. (Lynn) How was dinner? Ugh, it was like Chinese water torture. (woman on phone) Ms. Cooper? Yeah? I'm sorry, we have no record under that name. So you say you have no record of any Celeste Cooper at Washington University. And you checked her maiden name? I'm sorry, yes, we did. Well, that can't be right. And you tried the English Lit department, too? Yes, we did. Well, if you wouldn't mind checking again, I'd appreciate it. All right, we'll check. Thanks. That's weird. There must be some kind of explanation. Yeah. Oh, you took in $1,500 more than last month. You're kidding, really? Hm, yeah. Now you can afford to take us all on a cruise. No, Mom, you're gonna get your cruise, all right? You just gotta wait till I pay off this new machinery. We're gonna hold you to that, right, Laurel? (customer alert buzzes) Now you keep that bandage on, all right? The nurse's orders. I'm serious, it could get infected. You're so cute when you're serious. (chuckling) You know, I know my son. He really likes you. I like him, too. You know, I'm planning a surprise birthday party for him next month. You wanna help me with it? I'd love to. Where are you gonna do it? Well, I've been, um, looking at some restaurants near my apartment. I want it to be nice, but I'm on a budget. Well, why don't we do it at my place? Oh, Ted says it's beautiful. You wouldn't mind? No, of course not. That'd be great. (Laurel) No, no, no, no, no! Just don't listen, do you? Well, I can't give it back to the customer looking like this, you-- Oh, you're gonna do it? Okay, all right. Uh-huh. There's a couple of spots right here. Yes, sir. Actually, there's a couple. You get both of those. Okay. You don't really have a whole lot of experience with this, do you? Uh-huh, what's next? Could use a little buffing. You know what you could use? This! What? Hey! Oh, you want some more? You want some? Go ahead. Oh! (shrieks) Laurel? Hi, Frank. Is my mother's Lincoln ready? We're just finishing it up now. I'll bet you were. (laughs) Our ship leaves from Istanbul. Travels down the Turkish coast. Then we swing over to the Greek Isles. Stop for a day in Sicily and then end up in Monte Carlo. Ooh, what do you think of this? You really like that color? Will Laurel be going? Oh, no, no, she can't get that much time off. You sure she can't? I forgot to tell you the strangest thing. My son said he saw Laurel Saturday at a garage. He was picking up my car. And she was picking up hers. What's so strange? Well, he said she was working there. Cleaning cars. Well, I told him he must have been mistaken. Why would Laurel be doing something like that? She wouldn't be. Ma'am, I'd like to But he said she definitely was washing a car. ...try this on, thank you. (doorbell chimes) Come on in, it's open! Oh, it's freezing out there. Oh, looks like you're cooking for an entire army. I'm having a birthday party for Ted. Laurel, are you sure you should be taking that on? Why not? Well, I hate to say it but you have been looking a little tired lately. Between your job and Ted... I'm fine, Mom. Your father and I are worried about you. And that's why we are taking you on our cruise with us. Get some sun. Have some fun. You come back totally rested. Oh, and since you'll need to dress for dinner... I got you some evening clothes. I wish you would have told me a month ago. Then I could've gotten my work schedule changed around. I took care of that. I talked to your supervisor. Without asking me? Well, if I'd asked you, you would have told me not to. And I explained that this is the kind of trip that happens once in a lifetime. You asked for permission? What is this, third grade? Okay, honey, I'm sorry, I'm sorry. Maybe I crossed the line... No, you don't get it. I can't possibly go. I look totally unprofessional. This is about Ted, isn't it? Oh, don't try and make this Ted's fault. But it his fault. If you weren't so busy throwing yourself at him. What you mean is if it weren't for Ted, you wouldn't even have invited me on your trip. Someone has gotta stop you from making a total fool of yourself. (sighs) Washing cars in some filthy garage... What are you, part-time help? Oh, so that's it. People are talking. It's bad for your image? It is your image I am worried about. Look what's happening to you? What? I'm a regular person. Not someone on your social register. You used to appreciate the things I did for you. I still do. When they're for me. Great. (keypad beeping) (line ringing) (man) It's like I told you on the phone. This is all I could come up with on such short notice. You got a couple of trust deeds here for property bought and sold. You got marriage and divorce... I'm going to lunch. And this one's kind of interesting. It's a loan made to him by his in-laws for $90,000. That's a lot of money. Did he pay them back? I don't know yet. Look at what his ex-wife said during the divorce. That he abused her and hit his step-son. Yeah, that's what she said. But that explains the loan. They were trying to make him happy to protect her. I take all of these divorce accusations with a grain of salt. You wouldn't if it was your daughter he was after. (phone keypad beeping) (line ringing) Yes, is this Patti Rizzo? The Patti Rizzo that was married to Ted Rogers? No, no, you don't know me. But I need to talk to you. I fear that my daughter could be in grave danger. Watch out, that's a big step there. Come on. What are we doing here? I took a look at this house the other day and I liked it. And if you like it, I want to put an offer on it. Come on. You can afford this? Yeah, no, it's a great deal. There's a fireplace, and it's got hardwood floors. The floors are nice. Yeah, I think they're new. Kitchen... You wanna come look at the back yard? Okay. (squeaky whimpering) Puppy! Come here, sweetie. Come here! Oh, look at him. He's a little Buddy. Oh, look at him. (chuckling) What, sweetie! Whatcha got here? Oh, hey, that's for you. Here, open it up. Hey... (laughing) Will you marry me? There's nothing in the world I want to do more... But your mother. Mm-hmm. Okay, um... Let's just take it one step at a time. We won't drop a bomb on her about getting married. We'll just tell her, lie... Mm-hmm. We've decided to try living together for awhile? Okay, yes, yeah-- yes. (Harriet) I'll be back tomorrow to help you clean up, honey, okay? Thank you so much, it was just perfect! And so are you. Come on, Mike, put her down. Mike, Mike, this one's mine, all right? Hey, now wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. What makes you think that you can keep her all to yourself in this family, huh? I don't. Who says I want him to? Hey now, that's the spirit. Happy birthday, mwah. Bye, sweetie. Bye. See you tomorrow. See ya. Bye-bye! Great party, and the food was delicious. Well, I had a great teacher. Ha! See you guys. You going to see Raymond? Who knows? Don't wait up. I might not come home tonight. Bye, guys. Have a good time. I'm sorry, my family's really out-of-control. No, they're great... really. Here. To the future. What's up? (exhales) Something really weird happened today. I called my mom's high school friend, Rosalee. And she said Mom never went to college. She was working as a cashier when she met Dad. Come on. You mean she lied about going to Washington University? And about the writing award she won there. And when I contacted the mayor's office in St. Louis, they'd never heard of the drug prevention program that she started. I mean, it's not possible she's lying about this stuff all along. Why would she? (exhales) Look, I'm sure there's some explanation. Just ask her when she comes back next week. That's gonna break up there. Laurel? Honey? What are you-- What happened? I thought you weren't coming back till Friday? Did you have a good time? Oh, we had a great time. So, what's all this? Lynn moving out? She moved back in with Raymond last week. Oh. I was hoping to find a better way to tell you this. Tell me what? I'm moving out. Well, I, I, I don't understand. Where are you going? Um... I'm moving in with Ted. It was a very difficult decision, especially knowing how much you disapprove of him. Sweetheart, he's so wrong for you. Well, that's your opinion and I respect it, but my heart is telling me... To act like a fool? And when it doesn't work out? What happens then? Who will want you then? Mrs. Cooper, you're taking this all wrong. I want to marry Laurel. I want to marry her more than anything. But you told her not to rush into anything, and she's taking your advice. To move in with you. You can't possibly think I'd advise her to do that. You've got a point, Mom. We should either do this thing right or not at all. Great, because you two can't possibly be ready for a lifetime commitment after just a few months. (Laurel) I think I am. Let's get married. Yeah? Yeah. Okay. (phones ringing, chatter) I can't believe you decided right in front of her. Neither can I. But once I did, it just felt... right. I'm proud of you. Just don't back down. I won't. I don't care what she does. (intercom buzzes) (man) Laurel? Yeah? Your mother's outside. She says it's an emergency. (whispers) Don't back down. (Laurel) What's the emergency? I respect your judgment, Laurel, and I was hoping that you would have convinced me that my suspicions about Ted were foolish. I've had this information for awhile now. I didn't want to show it to you. I was hoping you'd come to your senses. Did he tell you that he owes his ex-in-laws $90,000? It's $15,000 now, he's been making payments. Did he tell you that he beat his wife and his step-son? Those are accusations she made during the divorce. She would've said anything to get back at him. For taking all her parents' money? Who can blame her? It's all right there. You had Ted investigated? I had to. It's a mother's job to protect her daughter. He has lied about himself from the very beginning. How many times have I listened to you brag about graduating from Washington University? I called the school, Mom. They've never heard of you. I don't know what you're talking about. And the award you got for starting that charity? A charity that never existed? Giving up a promising career to raise me? A career you never had. Ted put you up to this. No. You have no right to judge Ted when you can't even be honest about yourself. (Laurel)Ted? Yeah? Would you bring this stuff over to my mom's? She just called, she wants it back right away. Right now? If you don't mind. The sooner the better. Thank you. Mm-hmm. (Joan) Ted, what are you doing here? Oh, Laurel wanted me to bring back a box of stuff that she was using for the tribute. (Joan) She's finished already? You better to ask her about that. I will. Nice to see you. (doorbell chimes) Celeste? Celeste, you here? (Celeste) I'm in here! In my bedroom. Hurry... Help! Celeste? What happened? He wanted the money from our charity to pay for the wedding. Oh, my God. Oh, no, it's not the first time. He told me if I wanted to see Laurel I'd have to pay him $10,000. I haven't seen her since. I'm calling the police. No. I have to, he attacked you! No! What if it makes him angrier? What if he takes it out on Laurel? No, this is my problem. No one else can know. (Laurel) I just can't believe this, Joan, but thank you for calling. I appreciate it, thanks. What exactly happened when you brought that box of stuff by my mother's? I don't know, nothing. I didn't see her. The door was open, I went in. She left the door open? Yeah, she hollered from the bedroom that she wasn't feeling well, so I just left the stuff in the entryway. Why? She's claiming you attacked her. What? (door opens) Mother!? Mother?! Mother? Oh, Laurel, thank God you've come. Joan told you what he did to me? I'm not here to commiserate. I'm here to return this. It's my key to your house. I won't be needing it anymore. I love Ted, and I am going to marry him. Nothing you can do is gonna stop that. All you've done is force me to choose between you. Laurel, look at me. I am black and blue. I tried to warn you, and now he's attacked me. Don't worry about the bruises. I saw Dr. Johnson, the plastic surgeon? You had your eyes done. Too bad you can't show them off at my wedding. Laurel? If you walk out of here, you are out of my will. Cutting people off can go both ways. Don't make me do it. I'm not interested in your money. I never was. Laurel... Laurel? (screaming) Laurel! (door closes) (organ processional playing) Oh, you look beautiful. You think? Oh, yeah, it's gorgeous. Let me see. Can I help you with anything? No, I think I've-- Ow! Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. Here, need this? No, it's under control. It's okay, it's okay. Oh, okay. All right. Oh, dammit. Oh, here, I'll get it. Here it is. There. Thanks. Mm-hmm. I just wish my family was here. I know it's hard. Maybe these will help. Something old? They belonged to my mother. She gave them to me. And I want you to have them. Oh... So pretty. Thank you so much. Really, for everything. Oh, sure, sweetheart. (Wedding March begins) I think, uh, they're all waiting for you. It's time to go, are you ready? Okay. (Wedding March playing) Do you, Laurel, take Ted to be your lawful wedded husband, to have and to hold, in sickness and in health, for richer and for poorer, till death do you part? I do. And you, Ted-- Yes, I do. I do... Then by the power vested in me, I now pronounce you man and wife. You may kiss the bride. (whooping, organ music plays) (organ recessional continues) (excited chatter, cheering) She reminds me of you the day we got married. Oh, shut up, George. (organ recessional continues, cheering) Why did it have to turn out this way? It's not over yet. (music playing, friendly chatter) (all) Ohh... Thank you. Oh, hang on there's more. What, what? Here we go, right here. (all) Ohh... Little matching deal for the kid, thank you. (Lynn) Okay, what's next? Here's another one from me. Hey, thank you. Mm-hmm. Oh, wow. Baby books. These are great. I know, I love those. This is gonna be so much fun to fill in. Look, sweetheart. First smile, first step. Oh, and look, the family tree. With room for all his relatives. Yeah, it's great. Oh, I'm sorry, honey. It didn't occur to me. Let's just take that page out. No, don't be silly. It's fine, no, stop. It's a difficult time for you. We all understand. Thanks, Mom. Mm-hmm. Hey, I get a hug... Ha-ha! (Lynn) All right, what's next?! This was much harder than I thought it was gonna be. I know. Daddy? If I'm barging in where I'm not wanted, just tell me to go. No, never. Oh, let me look at you. Oh-ho-ho... You look more beautiful than ever. Thanks... How did you know? Well, Ted called... He said he thought it might be the right time to come, so I rushed right over. So, uh, why don't you sit down. (sighs) Honey, you know, your mother misses you, too. I never thought I'd be doing any of this without her. But... what am I supposed to do if she won't accept Ted? What if she will? I mean, things are different now. You're having a baby! Our first grandson. I don't know. All the things she's said and done. I know your mother can be difficult. But believe me her heart is breaking. Why don't you be a big person? Call her. Tell you miss her. Just don't rub her nose in it. Let her keep her pride, hmm? (Ted) Might make you feel better. Yeah... Okay, uh... I'll, uh... I'll make sure we stay at home in case you decide to call. I love you. Love you, too. Laurel? Honey, over here. Sweetheart... Oh, I'm so glad to see you. Me, too. Oh, you look beautiful. You look so beautiful. Thanks. There you go. Oh, you poor thing. It must be so terrible. It was bad for the first few months, but I'm better now. Just a little awkward. Awkward? That's an odd way to put it. I would have thought something stronger. Really? Oh! I thought you might want to see this. Pictures of my grandson? From the ultrasound. (laughing) Oh, let me see, let me see. Well, let's see, this... Yes, this must be his head? (chuckling) No, there's his head. See? He's smiling. (laughing) Well, of course he is. He knows you've made the right decision. What decision? Honey, I know this isn't going to be easy, but we will be spending plenty of time together. And with my help, you'll be fine. Now I've got something for you. What's this? I've asked around. He's the best. Why would I need a divorce attorney? Well... your father told me how much you wanted to see me and how you were crying at your own shower. He led me to believe-- I want to leave Ted? Well, he didn't say that in so many words. Laurel, you have lived with Ted long enough to know what he is really like. Now I think with the baby coming-- You have the most amazing way of twisting things in your own mind. Laurel... If you only knew how much I wanted this to work. How much I'd hoped you'd changed. I thought you had come to your senses. I was wrong. It's my grandson I am worried for now. Don't think you're going to keep him from me. (phone ringing) We appreciate your interest, Mrs. Cooper. Given our current staff cutbacks. Reports from citizens are invaluable. I realize it's my duty to help. It's just that it's such an awkward situation. If he finds out-- No, he won't. We're accustomed to protecting the privacy of the people who bring these cases to our attention. So, in your opinion, Mr. Rogers is pocketing how much in unreported cash? Since he and my daughter were married? I guess he hasn't paid taxes on, uh, about 20, 30,000. You're sure? His spending habits are quite lavish, and I know that a great deal of cash passes through his business. Well, that'll be easy enough to determine when we do the audit. So do you think this might be serious enough to send him to jail? Now, let's not jump ahead of ourselves. (Laurel) Never gonna get that in. It's gonna fit, I told ya. Won't fit. I measured it. Won't fit! Oh! Ah... Is it time? They're coming awful fast. Hang on. All right, all right, okay, okay. (Laurel) Are you okay? (elevator bell dings) Don't worry. This is great. You're doing just fine. (Celeste) "Dearest Laurel... "I want us all to be a family again. I was wrong." Just try to relax. "Please forgive me. Love, Mother". (Laurel) Ahh! Ah, ah! Breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe, breathe. Okay? (woman over PA) Dr. Graham, please report to physical therapy. Dr. Graham, please report to physical therapy. Excuse me! Excuse me! Where are you going? My daughter's in labor. Her name? Laurel Rogers. Where is she? If you'll just sit down, I'll let them know you're here. No, I need to be with her. I'll be sure to tell them that. Mrs. Rogers, your mother's here. Oh, God, I can't deal with her now. I just can't, not now. I tried to tell her but she seems quite determined. I don't care! Not now! I'll take care of it. I'll talk to her, all right? Okay? Uh-huh. Celeste! Oh, thank goodness. Let's hurry. Where is she? You can't go in there. Well, why not? She's my daughter. That's my grandchild. She doesn't want to see you. Not right now. Maybe later, after the baby's born. After she's had a chance to rest. Or maybe never, right? Isn't that what you'd like? Celeste, you're taking this all wrong. Ted, honey, she's asking for you. Oh, hi, Celeste. (Laurel loud groan) (voices chattering louder, Laurel moaning) (Laurel) Oh, God! Honey, you're making too much of this. She didn't want to see you when she was in labor. That doesn't mean she never wants to see you. Yes, it does. You weren't there. You didn't see the smug look on his face. I'll be at Sam's. Call me when the carpet cleaner's left. (machinery powers down, clicks off) What do you think you're doing? Just looking. You're here to clean the carpets. Not examine my art. I'm sorry, lady, really, I-- How do I know you weren't going to take it? I'm gonna have to report this. Come on, lady, don't say anything to my supervisor. Why? Please? Has this happened before? No, it's just that he'll-- What? He'll have to tell my parole officer, okay? You've been in prison? I got some trouble a few years ago. If you say anything about this, it could set me back. Pack up your things. Meet me in the front hall. (baby crying) (Harriet) It's a boy. (Laurel sighing, baby crying) I think I could be convinced not to say anything to your supervisor and you could make some extra money. I'm not sure I-- Read it, you'll understand. I'll look forward to hearing from you. (Celeste voiceover) "I know someone who doesn't deserve to live. I'll pay $10,000." I mean, this guy killed your sister's kid. In New Jersey. She's a widow, I'd... I'd gone to help her out. And one day when I went to pick up her little girl after school, I got there just in time to see him dragging her into his car. What about the police? They couldn't find him? They did. But someone lied for him, gave him an airtight alibi. I had to, um... I had to identify my niece's body. Her head was... excuse me. Her head was mutilated with a hammer. I didn't sleep for months. The police said if we wanted anything done, we'd have to handle it ourselves. So my sister spent her life savings on a detective. But then they found the man right here in town. How do you want it done? Fast. A gunshot in the head. Make it look like a drug deal gone bad. His office is the perfect set-up for a dealer. No one can be seen coming or going. You sound pretty sure about all this. I am. Will you help me? No. Well, then why am I wasting my time? But there's this guy. I met him inside. Do you trust him? Yeah. Now, I want a thousand bucks besides whatever you give him. And I'll need detailed information. Do you have a picture of this guy? Oh, yes. Right here. (Joan) I don't know how we're going to make this work, I really don't. You know, we still need another ten thousand for the new wing on the hospital. Well, I say we do a Monte Carlo night. George and I were just there, and I know exactly how to set it up. Perfect. (phone ringing) We'll leave the ticket sales to Celeste. She can sell snow to the Eskimos. (all laughing) Hello? You're here right now? Out front? Well, can't you, um... All right, all right, I'll be right there. (doorbell rings) Wow! What's that? (Lynn) My... Come on in. What did you order? Nothing. (conversational chatter) Well, open it up. I am. (gasps) Look, it's a bear. (Laurel) Wow, it's heavy. Who's it from? Is there a card? I don't know. Is it from Ted? My mother. Now, uh... I normally wouldn't do a job like this for someone I don't know. You understand what I'm saying? But Burt here vouched for you. (Celeste) Oh, I appreciate that. That's why I'm hiring a professional. I want whoever does this to be extremely careful. As careful as I am. Now, destroy this before you do the job. Now this is his office, and there's no exit or entry except in this little street here, and the people in the other buildings can't see who comes or goes. And his hours are? He works Monday through Friday, 8:30 a.m. to 5:30 p.m. How much cash does he keep there? Oh, not enough to make it look like a robbery. I want the police to find drugs. So you think they'll figure it was a drug deal gone bad? If you do it right. Just plant some crack on the body. Nah, Cocaine is what you want. Yeah, you need at least an ounce. Oh... How much does that cost? Seven, $800. And every time I do a job, I buy a new gun. See, I never use the same piece twice. And for this, uh... For this, I'll be working with another guy. So, I need a thousand up front to take care of everything. All right. I want you to shoot him in the head. When you walk out, I want him dead, not just wounded. Oh, I'll make sure it's done right. Now, uh, understand, once we leave here tonight, there's no turning back. Oh, I won't change my mind. You gonna stay this cool if the police question you? I'm a well-known woman, prominent in the community. Who would think I had anything to do with it? But what if they do? Dig up your sister's case while investigating and tie it into you? Well, do it in the morning. I have an exercise class at 9:00 a.m. I-- I can't very well have done it if I'm in the gym, now can I? What about the other $9,000? Well, when I have proof that he's dead, and I see the story published in the papers, I'll pay you the rest. Just call me and say "The carpet's been cleaned." That's all I need to hear. Yeah, no problem. Any questions? No, I think everything is pretty well covered so, uh, you know, that's it. Good. Oh, oh, oh, how soon? Soon... Soon. (Ted) Hey, what is this? "Dearest Laurel... Congratulations, sweetheart, love, Mother." That is some bear. Of course it is. It's from my mother. Well, maybe she's finally coming around. I don't know. (Ted) She came to the hospital, and you never called her. Maybe now is the time. No, something about this just doesn't seem right. (baby crying) Oh... you go. No, you go. (moans) (Ted) It's your turn. It's always my turn. What time are you gonna be home tonight? Early, remember? I'm gonna take you out for Valentine's dinner. Just the two of us. (barking) Come on, Buddy! (Buddy barking) Come on, Buddy! (barking) Come on! Come, Buddy. Come on! (car starts) (horn honks) Thank you for staying tonight so that we can go to dinner. Goodbye, sweetie. What did you get? I don't know. That's so sweet. Isn't it? (phone ringing) Don't! (ringing continues) Look, um... (ringing continues) I got a wife and a new kid, okay? So you guys, you just take whatever your want, all right? Shut up! Come on, move. Move! Hey, they're ready for you in the cath lab. (line ringing) (ring stops abruptly) Come on. Come on, move, move! Move! Let's go! (water splashing) I said let's move. Come on, let's go. Move it! Move! Get up, go! I'll the call bank, all right? They'll give you all the cash I got, I-- Shut up, I don't want your money. Hey, hey, what are you guys gonna-- Get in! Get in! (Ted) Look, you don't want to do this. Shut up, shut up! (tires screech) Yeah, the carpet's been cleaned. Oh... Did you clean it completely? Yes, just like we talked about the other day. Well, as soon as I see the story in the papers, I'll-- No, no, no, no, no, no. I'm getting out of town. I'm not waiting around for any newspapers. I need verification. I'll tell you what. You call the morgue. The County Medical Examiner's. Hell, you're a smart lady. You'll think of something to tell 'em. I appreciate your point of view. I'll try and accommodate you. Yeah, you do that. (click, dial tone) (Lynn) Laurel, Terry's relieving you. Why? Come on. Why? What's going on? Come on... Please, Laurel. What's wrong? You have to go home right away. Something's happened to Ted. What? (Lynn) Well, don't jump to any conclusions. I'm trying not to. Drive carefully. Remember you've got a baby at home. (phone ringing) Supervisor Yamazaki, can I help you? (Celeste) This is Sergeant Brolin, County Sheriff's Department. I'm enquiring about the remains of a Ted Rogers. We've been told they were delivered to you this morning. Yeah, he came in a few minutes ago. Cause of death... Multiple gunshot wounds. I'm gonna get to him this afternoon. We're trying to match him with an attempted rape case we have on file. Can you give me a description? Yeah, hold on. 5'11", 180, brown hair, blue eyes. Any distinguishing marks? He's got a small scar on his left knee. (Celeste) That fits our description. Thank you. (tires screech) (baby fussing) Ava, what's happening? Where's Ted? What? Sweetie... Ava, what's going on? Who are you? I'm Dick Cutler. What? Dick Cutler, the County Sheriff's Department. Where's Ted? Can I talk to you for a moment in private, please? Well, where's Ted? What's happening? Ted's fine, ma'am. Everything's okay. Ted's fine. I, uh... had a conversation with your mother last week, and she hired me to kill your husband. Yeah. What? Can I have that tape recorder? (Celeste) Hello? (Cutler) You checked to see if the job is finished? (Celeste) Oh, yes, the Coroner's Office assured me your work was very thorough. I've gone ahead with the other arrangements we discussed. (Cutler) So I'll see you at the Snelgrove parking lot. Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Tomorrow. (Cutler) 12:00. Sure will. Luckily she hired the wrong guy. We got Ted in a safe place. Don't worry, he's fine. He's okay. I got him on the line for you. Ted? Yeah. Are you okay? Yeah, I am now. Oh, man, they did everything they could to make this thing look real. They were afraid that she would-- she was gonna have somebody watching. I can't believe she'd go this far. What, to hire a hitman? Yeah, well, they played me the tapes. What if the guy she tried to hire hadn't gone to the police? But he did. Hey, don't worry about me. I got more bodyguards here than the President. When can I see you? I don't know, um... I guess as soon as they arrest her. Are you okay? I love you. I love you, too. Listen, they're telling me I gotta hang up now. Hey, kiss Steven for me, okay? I love you guys. I love you, too. Bye. Mrs. Rogers, you need to start making phone calls, ma'am. Telling family and friends that Ted is dead. Now we gotta make this look good until she makes the payoff. (phone ringing) (phone ringing) (Celeste) Hello? What is it, Joan? Oh, my God. (hangs up phone) Your mother's here. She's walking up the driveway. I can't do it. Oh, yeah, you can. You have to. Now she's probably here to make sure she's not a suspect. What if I blow it? You won't. Now do you want her to get away with this? (doorbell chimes) Go ahead. (doorbell chimes) Oh, Laurel. Mom. Oh, my poor baby, oh... When Joan called I came as soon as I could. Oh, honey... Don't worry, sweetheart. I'm here now, okay? How're you doing? Okay. Are you all right? I'm trying to be. What did the police say? Do they know who did it? It's unbelievable, they don't have a single solid lead. They found, uh, cocaine in Ted's office so they think it has something to do with drugs. That's not Ted. It's just so hard even thinking about it. Oh, I know, I know, sweetheart. And until you're feeling better, Daddy and I would love nothing better than... to help you take care of our grandson. How's he doing? He's asleep. I just put him down. Would it be too much to ask if I could take a peek? He is beautiful. Isn't he? I think he looks like Ted. I wish I could take away your pain, Laurel. You know I would if I could. Just remember that time heals all wounds. I promise. Maybe we should let him sleep. Good night, sweetheart. (sniffles) That was, uh... tough. But you did a good job. Now let's pray that she spills her guts tomorrow and gives us enough to convict her. Just make sure you get it on tape. You ready back there? Wait a second. Got her. So is your sister satisfied? Oh, she's satisfied. I'm satisfied. Everybody's happy, except-- Except? (snickers) (laughing) The one that's in the morgue. (laughing) No... No, I don't... I don't think he's too happy. (laughing) No, he's not too happy. Ahh! Did anybody see you? No... Nobody was around. Hmm. And the cocaine, did it look like it was a plant? No. See, it looked like he was involved, so that's why he's dead. Perfect, just perfect. Okay... We're losing it. Well, do something. We're losing, uh-- CB, jeep right there. Let me try. Did you steal any jewelry? No, I didn't take anything. Any money? Look, this is strictly business. I'm not looking to make anything extra here. Mm-hmm. And the gun, what did you do with the gun? I got rid of it where nobody can put their hands on it. (Detective) What about now? No? No, no, nothing, still nothing. What about now? No? No. And whose car did you use? Were you careful about the plates? Look, lady, I rented the car. I stole the plates. Trust me, I know what I'm doing. I can see that. And I'm glad. Sweet screaming Jersey, lady. You are very... very cautious. All right, we're clear. We've got 'em. (Celeste) And since it seems that everything is in order... (Detective) Come on, come on, you haven't paid him yet. See, you can't be too cautious at a time like this. So here. I want you to count it because I want you to be sure. Each bundle a thousand? Nine bundles, each bundle's a thousand. Bingo. Let's check and make sure we got everybody here. All the President's men. Now, I am going to keep this to myself. I hope you do, too. Lady, I wouldn't be in business as long as I am. Now I have never met you. I don't know you. I will stick to that story till the day I die. Okay! See, too many times, people confide in a friend or a girlfriend or a guy'll go into a bar and he'll talk to a girl. And you know, a lot of those girls are cops. You don't know who you can trust. No, you can't be too careful. You know any cops around here? No, I don't. Not in this area. No? Now you do. (siren approaching) What? (siren blaring) You lying bastard. Step out of the car, please, ma'am. Ma'am, please, would you step out of the car? Please! Get out of the car! Thank you! Give me that. (Celeste) I have no idea... Put your hands on your head. I think we do. Interlock your fingers. Interlock your fingers! (Celeste) I need to call my lawyer. An attorney will be appointed... My lawyer will be very upset about this. Get your hands off me! Anything you say can and will be held against you. Settle down! Do you understand these rights I just recited to you? Who's going to take my car? Thanks, guys. Don't worry about it. What about my purse? I need to call my lawyer. Don't leave my purse there. (Cutler) We'll get your lawyer. We'll get your purse. You'll be very sorry. Yeah, yeah, okay. You'll be very sorry you did this. (reporter) Here he comes. Here he comes. (reporters shouting) (reporters shouting, shutters clicking) (baby fusses) It's good to be home. (loud chatter) (newswoman) We are expecting Celeste Cooper to arrive here at any moment now. This is a bail hearing for a woman who is being described as the world's worst mother-in-law. It is scheduled to begin just as soon as Mrs. Cooper arrives. She is here. Let's see if we can ask her a question. Mrs. Cooper, how will you plead? Innocent. The only thing I'm guilty of is protecting my daughter. Protecting her from what, ma'am? Her husband. He's a liar, an abuser, a wife-beater. He even beat me. So are you telling us you had no choice? I'm telling you that I love my daughter and my grandson with all my heart, and their lives were in danger. I couldn't bear the thought of finding them dead one day because she couldn't or wouldn't listen to me. I did what any loving mother would do. But according to your daughter, ma'am, there was never a problem. What abused woman admits to the truth? (loud chatter) Laurel? Laurel? It's not too late to tell them, sweetheart. Tell them, Laurel. Tell them I did it all for you. Goodbye, Mother. (Celeste) That's okay, she's just confused. When this is over, she'll know I was right. And everything will be back to normal. Everything will be normal again.
