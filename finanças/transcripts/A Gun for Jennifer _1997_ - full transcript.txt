(dramatic music) (horns honking) (beeping) - [Man On Message] Hello, Josh. Josh, are you there? It's your father, pick up the goddamn phone. Your mother just showed me last week's Backpage Josh, and I can't believe it. Three weeks after your acquittal and you placed another goddamn ad. Are you outta your fuckin' mind? Well, this time I swear, I'll cut you off completely. Hear me? Completely, not another dime. You'll be out in the goddamn streets and the next time you're arrested, you're gonna rot with the other trash. So don't expect your mother to save you either. I won't let her. We've had it, Josh. You've brought too much shame to this family, but now it's gonna stop. (beeping) - [Woman] Hi Josh, it's Tracy Miller. I auditioned for you yesterday. Anyway, if you still wanna get together to discuss the Gwendolyn character, tomorrow night would be fine for me after all. Okay, I'll see you then. (beeping) - [Woman] We're gonna get you, fucker.

How much you got? 70, yo shit, let's take that out. Check this out. Allison, Allison chill out. Spencer from Steubenville. - Must be a farm bitch. - You a farm bitch from Ohio? Where's the rest of your money at? - [Allison] No, I swear to God. (screaming and crying) You don't want your money, I don't want your fucking money. There's your money, there it is. (muffled speaking) (screaming) (muffled speaking) Fuckin' if you were a fuckin' man, you would fuckin' get some of this. - Fuck you. (indistinct) (screaming) - You shut your fuckin' mouth, or I'm gonna fuckin' bite your nipples off, you fuckin' whore, now quiet, 'cause I am fuckin' in charge here. - Oh shit. (beating) (gun firing) (slugging and shouting) (muffled speaking) - I didn't know that fuckin' bitch. (tense music) (muffled speaking) (muffled speaking) (banging) - What's the matter with you? - Kill him and (indistinct). - Wait. Let her do it. - I can't, please. - Pull the fuckin' trigger. - Shut up. (yelling) - Please no, I can't. - Damn it. - No, please! (gun firing) (gun firing) - [Woman] That was fuckin' beautiful. - Get her outta here. (tires squealing) (heavy metal music) - So what's your name? - Jennifer. (lyrics muffled) - Hey, you okay? Do you need anything? A beer, something stronger maybe. - A glass of wine would be great. - No problem. - Do you wanna see a doctor? Did they? - No. Pretty lucky you guys got there when you did. Jesus Christ, those guys are really dead. - At least you're alive. - You know, it's no wonder those scumbag picked you up. You gotta sucker written all over you. - What do you mean? - Your clothes? Look at 'em. - [Woman] Yeah, they all dress that way where you're from? - Yeah, pretty much. - Where you from, anyway? - Ohio, Steubenville. - Stupidville. - Steubenville. - I'm sorry, it just sounded like that. - So what brings you to New York, Jennifer? Any friends or family here? - You married? (sinister music) - It's a simple question, Jennifer. - No, not anymore. Not after last night, anyway. - What happened last night? - Leave her alone, Priss. - We just saved her ass. The least she can do is answer a few simple questions. - I walked out, I couldn't take it anymore. Look, do we have to talk about this right now? - Yeah, why not? It's interesting. - Leave her alone, Priss. - I left my husband, he was crazy. He was trying to kill me. - So you just packed up and left? - Yeah, like I said. - Fuck him, serves him right. - Good for you, Jennifer. - [Woman] Look, where are you gonna stay? - I dunno. I'm sure I can find a cheap hotel, if it's clean at least. - [Woman] Clean and cheap? Not in this town. - Hey, how about staying with us? I have a sofa bed at my place. You can crash with me. - I don't wanna be any trouble. - No trouble. Let me fix you up with some clothes. We'll get rid of that Betty Crocker poster child look. - [Woman] You know, if you want some extra cash or something, you could probably pick a few tips here. - I don't think I could take my clothes off for strangers. - [Woman] You only have to do that if you dance silly. - She'll be fine as long as she's smart, and keeps her mouth shut. You understand, don't you Jen? - Yeah, I think so. (muffled voices on police radio) - Well, look what the cat dragged in. - Good morning, Detectives (indistinct). - Hey Perez. - Cahill. - God, what'd they do to this bastard? - That's Gilby, the rapist. - Yeah, that's Josh Gilby. - Just thought we'd drop in on you and the rookie. - Hey look, enough with that shit, okay? It's been over three months. - Over three months. Can't teach him another damn thing, huh? - You know, fuck you Cahill. This is probably one of your friends. (muffled police radio) - Christ, I don't believe this shit. Three in one day. - Three? - Castrations. First thing this morning, we get a call about a couple of stiffs over by the Port Authority. Two young punks, beaten to a pulp and shot. One of them had his balls shot off. The other one had 'em cut off with a knife. - What'd you find? - A woman's wallet with the stiff's fingerprints all over 'em. They must have mugged her before they got whacked. - Was there anything on the woman? - Ohio driver's license, mid-20's. - But what about the stiffs? Did you run their sheets? - We ID-ed one so far. - Any rapes? - A couple. Why? Don't tell me you think there's some connection with this guy? Come on, Billie. We're talking about a couple of street punks that got in over their head. They crashed the wrong party. The next thing you know, boom. - What about Josh Gilby? - What about him? - Look Tony, he beat up and raped 11 women. That's 11 that we know for sure, and what happened to him? - Just bullshit psych counseling, thanks to daddy's millions. - I'm familiar with the fuckin' case. - Who ain't? I mean, it was on the front of the Post for about five straight weeks. - You can read? - Grady, show him the Polaroids. Now here's the evidence that should have convicted that son of a bitch. - These were scattered all over the floor when we found him. - So these are the missing photos. - These are pretty wild. Tony, what do you think hard copy would pay for these? - So you think it's a vigilante killing? - Yes I do. - I think you're pressin' it, Perez. - I think all the years you worked in sex crimes has left you a tad biased, okay? - I'm not crying over Josh Gilby. - Yeah, well let's just remember one thing. Nobody forced those women up there, they went willingly. - You are such an asshole, Cahill. - An asshole. - Relax Billie, Cahill's just nervous. - What are you talking about? - Well, they're whacking rapists, right? - Yeah, so? - So, if they find out about you and that 12-year-old hooker, you gonna wind up on the list. - And I'm gonna take your fuckin' head off. - How's that pal? Come on, Cahill. - You little- - Come on, here I am. - You laugh, you little prick. You think you're hot shit up there in homicide with the big boys, huh? You better watch you don't wind up like her last partner, pal. - Hey, what the fuck? You know IA ruled in my favor. - Come on, tell him about Charlie Moran. Boy's got the right to know. - Al, get the fuck out of here. You watch your back, wise guy. You'll get your ass killed too, all right. - Tony, get him off my crime scene. - Chill out, I can take care of myself. - Yeah, let's hope so. - Sorry, Trish. I'm really grateful to you for all you've done for me, but I just don't belong. - I know it's been rough Jen. Give us a chance. I know you've got more in common with us than you want to admit. - Maybe, but I still don't fit in with your crazy little gang. - We just wanna see justice done, set things straight. - I don't care about any of that crap. All I wanna do is live a normal life. - And where are you gonna live it? Back in Ohio, or wherever it is you're from? I know you haven't told me everything. You really can't go back, can you? - I'm probably safer on my own, Trish. - They won't just let you go. - What do you mean? - You could burn us. - I'd never say anything. Christ, I'm the one that killed that guy that attacked me. Jesse made sure of that. She made sure that I was the one that pulled the trigger. - They won't take the risk. - What would they do, kill me? Jesus Christ, I don't believe this shit. - I'm sorry. You can stay with me as long as you want. - Let's go Jen, you gotta get up. - What are you doing? Oh God, what time is it? - Okay, all clear. (gun firing) Hey Jen, get over here. We got something for you. Come on Jen, hurry up. - Man, we don't have all day, now get over here. - Okay, what? - Take it. - Oh, I don't. - It's years, yeah. - See how it feels. - Go ahead, feel it. - Feel what? - The power man. Go ahead, feel it, and aim over there at the target. - The target. I really don't like guns. - Look, Jen you got a lot of catching up to do. Becky's gonna run you through the basics. You know Jen, if you're not with us 100% you're a liability. So go ahead, Becky. - Just listen to everything I say, okay. - Yeah. - Remember, a gun is a powerful weapon, but you have control over it. - Okay. - Okay? Now line up your front sight with the slot of your rear sight. - Okay. - Aim it at the target where you wanna shoot. - Okay? - Okay, now kick your legs apart, steady yourself. Straighten your back, extend your arms. - Okay. - All right. Line up both your sites. - Got it. - Aim at the target. Okay, take a deep breath in, breathe out slowly and squeeze the trigger. Squeeze the trigger. (gun firing) - [Jen] Did I hit it? (laughing) (gun firing) - That's how you fuckin' do it. - [Woman] So Priss is a show off now, huh? - There was this one time I was cooking with tomato sauce, and he came over to check on it, and he thought I made it too spicy. So he hit me and he hit me in such a way that I hit the pot, and the pot went and it splattered all over the front of me, and I could feel it like burning my legs and I started screaming and I was like brushing my pants off. And so he made me take off all my clothes and crawl on the floor and wipe everything up. - [Woman] That's pretty fucked up. - So why did you stay with him so long? You didn't answer that. - 'Cause I didn't have anyone else. - Actually, that's the first thing that ever came outta your mouth that I believe, 'cause I understand that. One of my first boyfriends was like that. He was like, he got me into all sorts of shit, and I just like sort of went along with it, and I actually thought that he was helping me out, even though I was getting more and more fucked up, you know, I thought. - Well, there's nothing wrong with men, okay? It's just the things that some people do are unforgivable, but men in general. - Well, you know what's funny is that it's usually men who do those unforgivable things, and I have never met one who isn't capable or hasn't done some shit. They all do some shit. (cross-talking) If they can get away with it, they'll do it. - You know, we're out here in the woods, and we end up talking about men again, man, I get so sick. - Why, why does his opinion matter? As far as like dancing is beautiful. - I've got nothing against you dancing, but I just don't understand it. I can't do it. - What do you mean you don't understand? (laughing) You're like showing these guys bodies and everything and they're thinking that they're gonna get sex or something. I don't understand, I mean. - Hey just 'cause I have a good body and I like to show it, that doesn't mean someone can just hop on me whenever they want to. - The thing is, you know, we're making a living for ourself and not depending on anybody else do it for us. - Hell, I used to a prostitute. I know many other skills. - God, if he ever saw me do something like that, if he knew that I, if I was like a waitress in a place like that. - I think you guys are missing the point. The point is that the job is not the dance. The dance is the front. The job is the justice, so the dance doesn't even matter. - What's so bad about a go-go bar? (rock music) (lyrics muffled) - Hey, how about some service? - Yeah, yeah. Any one of you sweet things wanna bring me and my brother a brewski please? - So what do you guys want? - Make it two shots of Cuervo and two Dos Equis. - No Dos Equis, just Bud, Heineken, and Miller. - All right, give me two Heinekens and the shots. Make sure it's Cuervo too, 'cause I can tell the difference. What (indistinct)? - Yes. - Just keep it. - Hey hey hey, why don't you pull up a chair, have a drink with us? What do you say? - Yeah baby. Right here. - She got intimidated by it. She saw us on TV, got nervous, right? - [Bartender] Last call, drink up. (rock music) (lyrics muffled) - Hey, sweetheart? That's kind of a big G-string you're wearing there. You've got some kids, yeah? - What? - Well, usually a big G-string means that you've had some babies. - Why, you think there's something wrong with my body? - Oh no, no, no. I'm just wondering, C-sections and scars and nasty shit. - No. Okay? I haven't had a fucking C-section, all right you fucking bastard. - Okay. - Yo, another round over here. - Sorry guys, we had last call, remember? - Go ahead, give 'em what they want. - You fuckin' bitch. - Keep your fucking hands off me. Hey, she only spilled it 'cause you grabbed her, you fucking prick. - Take it easy, all right? - [Prick] Look at this fucking coat, it costs me 500 bucks. - It's not so bad. Hey, be cool, all right? Listen, there's a lotta pussy about this place, man. These guys have been checking out since we walked in, all right? Don't fuck it up by decking one of them. Please? All right, sit down. Excuse me? Everybody. I would like to apologize on behalf of my buddy here. We're sorry about the disturbance. We didn't mean to cause any trouble, all right? We apologize, no hard feelings, okay? - Oh no sweat. Actually, the next two rounds are on us. - All right. Thank you. Did you hear that, man? I tell you this is a lock. (rock music) - Hey guys, can I ask you something? - Tell me what, baby. - You know the girl who spilled the drinks. - Stupid bitch, what about her? - Well, today's her birthday. - Oh. Working on her birthday, knowing that she's pissed off. - Too bad. - Yeah, you know? Oh, we were thinking about having a party for her, you know, after we close, and I was thinking it'd be a really great idea if maybe you guys hung out and helped us celebrate, you know? - Yeah, that's perfect actually, because my friend and I are doing a little celebrating ourselves. We just signed on for two more years on Dark of Night. Thank you. - Oh yeah? - It's one of the longest running soaps in New York. - Hey wow, I can't wait to tell the girls. They're gonna be really excited about this. - Be careful Jess. - Now, don't worry. Everything will be all right. - No, I mean it, Jess. You don't need any more trouble from the cops. - Look, go home, get some sleep. I'll call you tomorrow, okay? - Ah, Annie, don't leave. We're gonna have a party. (laughing) - What's wrong, boys? - Just waiting for the party to start. - [Woman] Let's go, start it, come on. - Well, what do you got in mind, huh? - Well you know, I was thinking that we would do something just a little bit special, a little different. - I have an idea. One of you babes come up here with us. - Some of you come up here and dance with me, the more the merrier, right? I'm gonna everything in this building, dude. - You're really gonna love this, Jen. Go boys. - Hey, let me see some skin. (indistinct) - What the fuck? You see that bitch? - Go on you little fucks, you're starting to bore me. - Take it off. That's right boys, all the way off. - I don't want to stay anymore, let's go. Come on. - What, you nuts man? This is beautiful. Look at them, they want to see your meat. Show 'em your meat. - Yeah I want to see you with the cover off. (laughing) - Are you pricks deaf? We said to take off your clothes, now take 'em off. We want to see if you're really big men. - I told you that's what they wanted, man. - Yeah. - Check it out, baby. What? What! Fuck me, this is fucking humiliating. Let's get the fuck out. - Get over against the wall. - What the fuck? What the fuck? - I don't care you fucker. (indistinct) huh? What are you gonna do now? You gonna talk about G-strings now? - Didn't anybody ever tell you not to hit a lady? - Fuck! (muffled speaking) - Don't worry little boy, we're just gonna teach you some manners, that's all. - What the fuck are you doing? - Trish, get me the pool cue. Did you say, fuck you? Look at the size of that. (screaming) - Here he is. Come on, let's go. Can we have a word with you, sir? Can we have a word from you, sir? Can we have a word from you? Please sir, can we have a word? How does it feel in there, sir? - I will tell you only one thing. I am completely believing in the American justice system. I know in the end I will be vindicated. - [Woman] Somebody aught to waste that fucker. - [Woman] Who is he? - [Woman] Carl Varna, real scum. - Yeah, he buys and he sells kids, gets them into pornography and prostitution, you name it. This guy's filthy rich. - Heard he does snuff films, too. - What's that? - Ladies, can we change the subject, here? - Well what's gonna happen to him? - Not enough. You know I'm afraid they're just gonna deport the prick. - He's with the Coretta crime family, very well connected. - [Woman] Yeah, and well protected. He never goes anywhere without his (indistinct) Jesse. - Look, I know where he lives, I saw it on TV. - Jesse. This is not the time or the place for that shit. (punk music) - So how you doing tonight, Jen? - Great. God, I made more money tonight than my husband did in a week. (gun firing) (screaming) (gun firing) - Don't fucking move, or I'll blow you all to hell. Listen up. I'm looking for whoever the fuck it was that fucked up my kid brother. - You looking for somebody? - Fuck that gun, bitch, or I'll blow her fucking head off. Hear me cunt, I'll waste her. - You kill her, and I kill you. - No please. - Okay, make it a fucking stand off. When the cops bust in, I'll tell 'em all I know about this goddamn joint. I'll tell 'em what you did to my kid brother. (sirens approaching) (tires squealing) (gun firing) (Jen screaming) - Police, drop the fucking gun. (dark music) - Whoa. We hear that was quite a shot you made, Jesse. You're a regular Dirty Harry. How'd you get to be so good with a gun? - Well, I've been around guns my whole life. My daddy was a Green Beret. Good old dad. Wanted to make sure I learned how to shoot properly, even if I was just a girl. Came pretty naturally to me, actually. Okay, so everything's cool. You guys, the gun's licensed. You have all the paperwork. - Oh yeah, everything's cool. The gun's legal. It's not in your name. - Oh no shit. It's Annie's gun. What did you guys expect me to go hide in the back and wait for you heroes in blue to come and save the day? I mean that fucking nut case could have killed everyone in here. I bet I saved a few lives. - So why did Annie give you her gun? - Because I manage this place for her. I'm the one that risks her ass every night to make the goddamn bank drop. - Listen, Jesse, you can't carry a gun in this city without a permit. That's gonna get you cute little ass a year minimum at Rikers. - Well, I guess I'm lucky I never got caught then, huh? Look, could we wrap this up? - No, you still haven't told us why the shooter, what was his name, partner? - Eddie Jarvis. - Yeah, why'd Jarvis want to kill everybody in here? Now, why was he so angry, Jesse? - How the fuck should I know? maybe he propositioned a bunch of the dancers and they all turned him down. That usually pisses 'em off pretty good. I mean they all have such delicate little egos. - Jesse cut the shit. - How should I know? He was a junkie. Why don't you take blood samples? - Look sweetie, cut the bullshit. - Don't fucking call me sweetie! - If he was on anything, forensics will let us know. Now, why don't you be a good girl and tell us what he was saying right before you capped him? - So does he call you girl on the job? - Answer the question, Jesse. - All right. What was the question? - What was he saying before you capped him? - He was talking bullshit. - Yeah well, a few of the a customers claim that they heard Jarvis said he wanted revenge for his brother. Now, why would he say that Jesse? - [Grady] Yeah Jesse, why would he say that? - Look, I've told you everything I know. I don't have the time or the interest to keep track of every nut and his brother who comes in this place. - All right. That'll be enough for now. But you say in town because we may need to speak to you again in a few days. - You got a problem with that, Jesse? - Do I have a choice? - What do you think? - I think she doesn't like cops. - Yeah, we should definitely check her out, and Jarvis's brother, too. - Oh yeah. - What about that waitress? - [Grady] What about her? - I've seen her somewhere before. Did anybody get a statement out of her? - No. The woman that owns a place that she just started last week, she's not gonna know anything. Besides, we oughta leave her alone after what she's been through. - What's you mean, leave her alone? What, you turning soft on me already, Grady? - Jesus Christ Billie, look at her. They're cleaning Jarvis's brains out of her hair, okay? We'll come back in a couple of days and get a statement. - I've seen her somewhere. - [Grady] All I wanna see now is breakfast. His name's Raleigh. - Who? - Raleigh Jarvis, Eddie's younger brother. And just like Eddie, he's a card-carrying Hell's Angel 3rd Street chapter. - Does he have a sheet? - OD-ed four weeks ago. - Shit, stay on the right, right? So was it suicide? - Well, it sure as hell looks like it. See Eddie found him unconscious, right? Takes him over to Beth Israel, gets his stomach pumped, and there was so many fuckin' pills it was like a drug store, not to mention traces of cocaine and booze. - Yeah, Eddie said he wanted revenge for his brother, right? - Yeah. - Maybe something happened at the Widow's Den that pushed him to suicide. - Like? - I don't know. Maybe they messed him up or something. - Hm. I don't know about that, but I did get the low down on Jesse. - So spit it out, partner. - [Grady] Jesse Skinner shot and killed her father, Colonel Frank Skinner, at the tender age of 14. She claimed the old man started molesting her and her younger sister Trish right after their mother died. - Jesus, looks like daddy taught her to shoot pretty good, huh? - [Grady] Colonel Frank was a real John Wayne type. Fought in two wars, got every medal there is to get. At Fort Benning, they practically worshiped the guy, so nobody believed Jesse's story. - [Billie] What a surprise. - [Grady] Jesse ended up at the Elvira home for disturbed children. She kept busting out, fighting with other inmates, even stabbed the doctor. So they bumped her up to the Georgia State Correctional Facility for Women. - [Billie] A 15-year-old girl in the Georgia pen? - [Grady] Jesse spent three years there, finally released on her 18th birthday, considered fully rehabilitated. - [Billie] What about her sister? - [Grady] Trish was bounced from one foster home to the other, nobody wanted her. She ran off to New York as soon as she turned 18. Her record's clean except for a few shoplifting charges. (women yelling) - [Billie] Anything big on the others? - [Billie] Grace Ferrell was a call girl on the upper east side. One time she beat the shit out of a British diplomat with a spike-heeled pump. Could have done time, only the guy wouldn't press charges. Didn't want his wife to find out. Vice busted Priscilla Soto over a dozen times for street walking. She was the prime suspect in the murder of a west side pimp a few years ago, only the prick wasn't too popular with the boys downtown. They called it self-defense and let her walk. Now get this, back in '88, the FBI caught Becky Greer and a gang of militants breaking into a National Guard armory in the Bronx. Feds claimed Becky and her friends were planning to arm terrorist groups in the US and Mexico. She was lucky, only got five years at the federal lockup in Pennsylvania. Out in three for good behavior. She was the youngest of the bunch. - [Billie] Was Jesse involved? - [Grady] Not that we know of. Jesse dropped outta sight till the late 70's when she came to New York to hook up with her sister Trish. She worked odd jobs, took classes at NYU, finally ended up running the Widow's Den, which by the way happens to be owned by Annie Friedlander, former rape counselor, big time activist in the 60's. - [Billie] A feminist running a go-go bar? - [Grady] LCB says the bar used to belong to her brother until he died of a stroke at 75 and willed to her. That place is a real cash cow, pulls in nearly 200 G's a year, and that's on the books. - [Billie] So what have they all been up to since Annie took them in? - [Billie] Nothing illegal, apparently, turned into a bunch of angels. - [Billie] Maybe they found religion. - [Grady] Yeah, right. - [Billie] Well, if this town's got a vigilante hit squad, these women are the perfect suspects. Thanks. Well, you know, this doesn't prove anything, right partner? But I think we're headed in the right direction. - Well, it sure as hell looks like it. - So what do you say, you with me on this? - Yeah, of course, you're goddamn right I am. Look, if we solve these killings, we'll be legends. They'll make fucking movies about us. - Yeah right, my part'll be played by Bridget Fonda, or somebody like her. (rock music) ♪ You say she was a slut ♪ ♪ She wanted your sex ♪ (lyrics muffled) - Last night in Manhattan's lower east side, a 14-year-old girl was found unconscious in the trunk of an abandoned car. She was apparently abducted on her way home from school, and repeatedly raped and beaten. Police suspect a local drug gang, but are receiving little cooperation from the neighborhood. There's speculation residents- - Those bastards. They should choke on their fucking balls. - [News Reporter] The girl is now in critical condition at Saint Vincent's hospital. More from Natalie Ramone (indistinct). - Priscilla, you know that area pretty well, don't you? - [Priss] Yeah, my sister and her family live there. The neighborhood was never really great, but since the crack gangs moved in, it went straight down the toilet. - So do you think that you and Becky could maybe hit the streets and find out more than these cops know? - My pleasure. - Okay, I'll cover your shift. - Hey Jen, Looks like you're gonna see some action sooner than we thought. (dramatic music) - All right everybody, lock and load. - So Jennifer, you're gonna stay in the van, and you're gonna keep the engine running. And as soon as you hear gunshots, you're gonna pull up to the door and you're gonna wait. And if there's any sign of trouble, don't hesitate to use this. You understand me? - Yeah, Prissy sure. - Do you understand me? - Yes, I understand. - Good. - All right, it's time to move. (tense orchestral music) You fuck this up and so help me I'll shoot you myself. - That's bullshit, Caesar. Don't you bullshit me. What kind of dumbass prick do you take me for? - I swear on my mother, I never shorted you. I never shorted you man. - For two years, I was the only one that ever fronted you anything. This is the thanks I get? I should string you up by your fucking balls. (knocking on door) - Ola, I'm Maria. I'm calling you, are you guys partying tonight or what? - I don't think this a good time now, honey. - Oh, come on baby, I wanna party with you. I wanna make you happy. - Poison, let in the bitch. (indistinct) - Tell the whore to get lost. - Relax, relax, relax. Is she alone? - There's some bitch here, man. - Yeah man. - Who the fuck you letting in here? - That woman buys drugs, okay, she buys my drugs. Be cool man, be cool. Let her in, it's okay. (gun firing) (guns firing) (screaming) (yelling) - We're missing one. - Come on. - Shut the fuck up. (muffled shouting) - No. (screaming) - Let's go! - What about the girl? - She chose her friends poorly, kill her. (screaming) (gun firing) - Fuck. Shit. - You okay? - Come on, let's go. Come on you guys, get in the van, let's get the fuck out of here, go! - Buenos Noches, Maria. (screaming) (gun firing) Holy shit! She fucking blew them away. - [Woman] Come on, let's go. - I guess the press didn't buy our rival gang theory. - Lieutenant, the word on the street says it's vigilantes. (phone ringing) - Lieutenant, that's bullshit. There is no way that this gang massacre is vengeance for the rape of that girl. - Why is that so hard for you to believe, Tony? - We're cursed. - Lieutenant, listen to me for a minute, all right? We're talking about an area where they got more homicides than we can count, all right. Listen to me, half of them are in broad daylight. Keeping that in mind, sir. What makes the rape at this girl so special? - Tony look, maybe it was the last straw, but whatever the reason, forensics is certain that a straight razor was used to castrate both Josh Gilby and Ramon Garcia, the leader of the murdered gang. - It's gotta be a coincidence. Rival gangs are cutting themselves up all the time. This is nothing new. - Listen gang, let's think long term here for a change. All right? Follow what I'm talking about. You got a nut running around the streets. All right, the guy commits some heinous sex crime, a rape or sodomy, whatever it is, the guy takes a collar. Lot of press on it. He winds up in court, for some bullshit technicality he walks. The guy's not home an hour before my phone rings. I got a DOA with a dick in a bottle. Follow me? Now, let's think back a little bit. You got the gang massacre last night. You got the Gilby homicide. Before that you got the gynecologist. You remember the guy that raped the six patients? Okay, and before that Farentino, the gym teacher's probably our first one. You remember him with the rapes of them little boys? That's called a pattern. And I got news for you. Not only do we got a pattern here, but we got a crew of people that are getting more violent with every case. - Okay Lieutenant, following that train of thought, Perez's been investigating the case. She says they're vigilantes. Who are they? - Billie? - I think they're women. - Oh, she's out of her mind. - This is getting too wild. I mean now we got a bunch of crazed chicks running around with guns. It's attack of the killer bimbos or something here, Lieutenant. - Cahill, Cahill, shut your hole a minute, all right? - Okay. - Grady, what do you think about what your partner's got to say? - My senior partner's got a gut feeling. Who am I to questioned it, right? - Listen, Billie's been the only one that's been consistent on this from day one. You tie that in with her background in sex crimes before she came to homicide, I like her as the number one on this. Billie, you carry the ball from here on in. - Lieutenant, that's bullshit. - Excuse me. Detective Perez is number one on this case from here on in. - Boss, boss, Tony and I have seniority over detective Perez and Grady here. - Cahill, unless you'd like to take that seniority down to the Lincoln Tunnel, where you're gonna be wearing a reflecting belt with a whistle stock in your mouth for the rest of your career, I advise you to shut your mouth. - I know. Look, what I want. - Shut. All right, now the four of you get the fuck outta my office. Get to work. (muffled speaking) - [Grady] I guess just being you Cahill is all it takes. - [Cahill And Tony] Fuck you. (rock music) ♪ Gonna make you blush ♪ - Well, have you guys read the papers today? - Yeah, I think we made the front page on all of them. - Oh, that's right. - So what's wrong? You don't seem very happy about that. - I'm not very happy, Grace, Look, you guys are so pleased with yourself 'cause you wasted a few pieces of shit? - Yeah, we are, aren't we happy? - Well, while you're here partying, the whole world is sinking into the sewer. - Jesse, what is wrong? - What's wrong? Look at that, Trish. - Judge Sawyer is acquitted. - They let the fucking bastard off. - Who is that? - Judge Phillip Sawyer, the state justice that raped and beat a young call girl. - Wait a minute, I thought she dropped the charges. Oh, come on Grace, you don't actually believe that shit. Man, they leaned on her. We can't let them get away with this. - Christ, Jesse, he's on the state Supreme Court. - He raped and beat a woman. I don't care if he's the fuckin' president. - Calm down, Jess. - Okay, all right. You know, we've gotta act on it. We gotta send a message out there that nobody gets away with rape, no matter who they are. - Hey Tony, did you see anything out of the ordinary? - Nothing. Four straight days, not a fucking thing. This whole gig's a bust. - Hey rookie, you got any messages for your fiance? Going to her house now. Goodnight. - Thanks Billie, for volunteering us for the night shift. It's nice, 'cause I don't fight with my fiance anymore. Maybe 'cause I don't fucking see her anymore. - Grady, you think those two clowns would've stayed awake? Huh? (dog barking) - Four days. Four goddamn days, you'd think they'd give us a radio so we can listen to some music. - Grady, fuck the radio. Just keep your eyes open, all right? - Fuckin' eyelids feel like they're made outta lead. (dog barking) Sure. That's nice, we're out of coffee. Ain't it the best? (dog barking) What makes you so goddamn sure they're gonna whack this judge? - Grady, I told you. The case is all over the TV and the newspapers, and besides that son of a bitch deserves it. - Cahill's right. You're on their side. - Grady, you know you're my fucking partner. Now, why don't you try giving me a little support for a change, instead of beating me down with the rest of them. - I'm sorry. Look, I'm just really fucking tired, okay? I'm sorry. I'm gonna go out and take a piss, all right? - One of the many advantages of being a man, just pull it out and the street, right? - Well I can't really argue with that now, can I? - Grady, come on, it's a respectable neighborhood. Now go in the judge's house and take a piss. You have the key. - You're nagging me here, you know that, like we're married, you're nagging me. - Yeah, in your dreams. Come on Grady, make it fast. (car alert dinging) - Might as well hit up your honor for some coffee while I'm in there. - Grady? Grady! Left his damn radio. It's 3:30, what the hell are we doing here? (dog barking) Damn it Grady, you got the worst fucking timing. This is Detective Perez, requesting backup at 5250 Riverdale Drive. Repeat, this is Detective Perez, requesting backup, 5250 Riverdale Drive. - [Dispatcher] Detective Perez, there is a 1013 already in progress in that quarter. - [Woman] Come on, get the lead out. (guns firing) (guns firing) - They got Trish. - No! - Try the house. Grab her fucking leg. - [Billie] Grady. (tires squealing) - Call the police. My God. Are you all right? - Get away from him. Get the fuck away from him, you bastard. Get away. (dog barking) (sirens blaring) - Oh Trish, (indistinct). No, just stay with us. We're gonna get you to the hospital. (coughing) We're taking her to the hospital now, right Jesse? Jesse, she's your sister. Jesse! Jesse. - Will you shut up? We can't go the hospital, all right? Don't you understand? (muffled cross-talk) - Fuck you. (confused shouting) - Shit. (crying) - She's dead. (yelling) It's your fault, it's all your fault, together. Let her die. (crying) - It's getting late. We better go. (horn honking) - How's the leg? - It's only through and through, but it's fucking killing me. You know how it is. - Yeah, I know how it is. Listen. You ever think about retiring? You know that I could almost guarantee you disability. - Forget it. - Billie, you're off the case. I want you to find yourself a nice beach someplace, park your butt there for a while and relax. Okay? You get back, we'll discuss your future with the department. - What the hell are you talking about? - Look, I took a call less than an hour ago. Internal affairs is handling the investigation. Billie, I ain't gotta tell you. Grady was your second partner you lost since you came to homicide. They suspended you. I did everything I could for you. - You gotta be fucking kidding me. Look. Lou, I really liked Grady, but you know he was green. Look didn't you read my report. He went in the house without his damn radio. It could have happened no matter who he was with. - Listen, I know that, I told him that. Billie, there's more to it than that. - What? I got a call from Judge Sawyer, also. He says, you threatened him with your piece? Did you do that, Billie? - You know what state of mind I was in. - Look, I send you to guard the guy, not to stick a gun in his face. - I did guard him and look what it got me. You know it makes me sick the shit I see guys get away with in this department. But what happens to them, huh? Barely a slap on the wrist, and you know why? 'Cause it's a fucking boys' club. I swear you don't have a dick between your legs, then honey you'd better stay on your toes, because you're not one of the boys, and you don't belong here, right? - I'm sorry. - Yeah, fuck, me too. But I'm not quitting. And if they don't want me here, that's tough shit, 'cause I'm not quitting. - Detective Perez. I need every piece of paper you have in the vigilante homicides. Billie, where you going? Perez, get the fuck in here. - We killed a fucking cop for Christ's sake, Jesse. When one of their own gets hit, they go berserk. - Cops got nothing on us. - Chris, don't you remember Detective Perez? We killed her goddamn partner. - Becky, what do you say we do? - Jesse, you know I'd march straight down to hell with you, but Grace is right. After losing Trish and killing that cop, we got no choice. We gotta lay low. - Man, you guys all talk about Trish as if I didn't care, man, as if I didn't feel responsible. Well you're all fucking wrong. - [Woman] Oh you are wrong, Jesse. We never meant that. - She was my sister for Christ's sakes. You think I don't feel bad, man. You think it doesn't bother me? It's tearing my goddamn guts out. - Jesse, there's too much fucking heat right now. We murdered a police officer, a detective no less. You know about the time I spent up in the joint, and I ain't going back. - So Becky, what are you trying to say? What the fuck are you trying to say to me? - I'm saying I'm with Grace. We gotta split up until the heat cools off. - This is bigger than all of us. We can't end it now, we've come too far. We made the TV, the newspapers, we've even got national coverage. We're finally starting to make an impression. - Shut the fuck up Chris. - You know she's right. I'm gonna tell you something. Man, Trish wouldn't step down. - Well, whatever you all decide, I'm outta here. - Where are you going? - I've just had enough of this fucking town. - Is that so? Funny, that doesn't surprise me at all. Just when things start heating up, you wanna run away. Put it away, Chris. - You never really were one of us, were you? - Jesus Christ, Chris. - We've had nothing but trouble since we picked her up. - Go ahead, try it. Just try it. I've had all I can take of your hard ass bullshit, always riding me. - All right, both of you, put it away, now! I mean it. - Look at you guys, man. You're all so scared and mixed up you're at each other's throats. - I mean, don't you remember when we felt invincible? Because we were United. Long ago women had real power. We were the elders, the shaman, the mystics, you know, life givers. - So what's your point, Jesse? - The point is I want us to unite again, one more time please, just for Trish. - Jesse, it's over. - Look, okay. Okay, you guys wanna call it quits. You wanna end this thing, huh? So let's do it in style. I say we kill Carl Varna. - Yeah. Varna, they'll give us a fucking medal. - Carl Varna. Are you out your minds? He's with the mob for Christ's sake. He's got armed goons all over the place. - Jesse, it's over. It's over, Jesse. - Fuck you! Fuck all of you, man. And you, Becky. I mean, I thought outta all of 'em, that you would've stuck by me, but you're just as weak and pathetic is the rest of them. - You're way outta line, Jesse, way outta line. - Get the fuck outta here. - Jesse, just cool it. - Get the fuck outta here. - Wait, Jesse, I'm with (indistinct). - Get the fuck outta here! - Oh Jesse, please don't do this. She's dead to you two times. - All of you get the fuck out of here! (crying) (high-tension music) - Goodbye honey. Take care of yourself. - Go on, we don't need you. - Careful. (crying) (dramatic music) - Police, freeze! Shut up. - What the hell are you doing? You're making a big mistake, really. - No don't bother Allison. You know, you got a nice dye job. Come on, lets get in the car. Come on. I saw your file from Steubenville. Now he beat you pretty bad, didn't he? - What are you gonna do, send me back to Ohio? - I don't know. You know, maybe I should let 'em fry you here, for killing my partner. - What are you talking about? - Come on, Allison. Now you've done a lot more than waitress, since you rolled into town. Look, I got you dead to rights. I can make sure you'll never see daylight again. - So what's stopping you? What do you want from me? - I don't want you Allison. I want your girlfriends. - Sorry, I don't know what you're talking about. - Look, don't fuck with me, Allison. I will crucify you. - I want a lawyer. - Fuck the lawyer. You listen, you help me with this, you'll go free. - Come on, you really think I'm that stupid? You'd say anything to get what you want. - Well, you'll just have to trust me. - Right. - Allison, you don't have a choice. Now, I made you. How far do you think you'll get if you try to run, huh? Every cop in this nation will be gunning for you, Feds included. You'll never make it out of the city. - So what am I supposed to do? - You go back to your girlfriends, and you act like nothing's changed, but the minute they make a move, Allison, any move, you let me know. You call me. I'm gonna give you my numbers to my mobile phone, to reach me at any hour, day or night. Now let me see your wrists. (Allison yelling) Don't even think about crossing me, girl. 'Cause I'll be watching you. You try to bolt and I will nail your fucking ass to the wall, harder than the rest of them, you hear me? I said, do you hear me? - Yes, yes, I hear you. - Good. Go on back to your psycho friends. (rock music) - Jesse? I thought I heard someone down here, what's going on? What are you doing dressed like that, Jess? Jess? Oh no. Now come on, wait Jesse. Where the fuck do you think you're going Jesse? Jesse no, don't do this. Jesse, don't do this. Please Jesse, don't go. Jesse! (phone ringing) - Yeah? Whoa, Annie. Annie, I don't understand you. Jesse? Shit. (punk music) - You have made me very angry, young lady. Very angry, indeed. You have killed my gunta. Do you have any idea how hard it is to find a man like that today? Who the fuck are you? A cop? Federal agent, perhaps? - She had no ID. Wasn't wearing vest. - So who sent you? Santini? The Montrose brothers? Answer me! - Fuck you. - Well, it speaks. This strange creature seems to think she's rather tough. Doesn't she, Anton? Well, if you were a cop, your colleagues would come here by now to your defense. But alas, you are all alone with me and my boys. (man chuckling) - [Man] Hey, maybe she's one of those vigilantes we've been hearing about. - You are so naive, Anton. Those stories are invented by the media in this country. But why don't we ask her all the same? Is that how you see yourself, as an angry vigilante with God on your side? Some angel of death come to vanquish the horrible devil. (laughing) Oh, I am sorry to disappoint you, my dear. Don't believe the press. I am not a devil. I am just a businessman. I know what people want, and I sell it to them. Bring her downstairs, but keep her alive for the party. (voice on intercom) - Allison. Get in here, Allison. What is wrong with you? What the fuck is wrong with you? Fucking stupid fucking bitch. - I'm sorry. I'm sorry. - What the fuck is wrong with you? - [Becky] I thought you were leaving. - Annie saw her leave about four in the morning. She had all her gear with her. - So what are we gonna do? - What do you think? We're gonna go get her. - Are you with us? - Oh, come on, she's worthless, I knew it. - Oh shut the fuck up, Chris. I'm in, but there's something I gotta go take care of first. - Bullshit, we'll never see her again. - Chris, she said she's with us, okay? - Okay, Jen, you go and do what you gotta do. If you ain't back by midnight, we know you ain't showing. - I'll be here. - Bet you a grand she doesn't show. (phone ringing) - Son of a bitch. (phone ringing) Yeah? Allison? - Meet me under the Manhattan Bridge in one hour. I can't talk right now, just meet me there in an hour. - Wait. Shit. Allison? Allison? - Drop the gun. - Shit. - Drop the gun. - What the fuck are you doing, Allison? - Shut up. Shut up and move. - What is this, payback Allison? Huh? You and the girl's gonna hit somebody, is that it? - Shut the fuck up. Shut up. - What now? Shit. - Now cuff yourself to that fence. Do it. Cuff yourself to that fence. Now gimme the keys. Don't make me shoot you. You already pinned one dead cop on me, I got nothing to lose. - Who's it gonna be this time, Allison, huh? You can't finish the judge. He fled to Florida the day after you tried to waste him. Shit. Let me think. Trials, acquittals. It's gotta be somebody in the news. Somebody worth the trouble. Carl Varna. (knocking on door) (knocking on door) - Well, well, well Chris, look who's here. All right guys. Enough of this bullshit. Let's go get Jesse. (drumming) - Later, I have a surprise for you. Do you want a surprise, darling? Tell me you want a surprise. (moaning) - Look, look. That's what happens to naughty girls. Some of them are pretty girls like you. You're a nice girl. They cut you apart. (muffled speaking in background) - Hi. - Hi. How you doing? Do you have an invitation or party here? - An invitation? - Yeah, an invitation. - Yeah. - Know what an invitation is? - Yeah, I know what an invitation is. - Look like you know. - Here's your fucking invitation. - Where's Varna? Where are they keeping Jesse? - I don't know what the fuck you're talking about. - Listen, we're gonna kill you. So why don't you just tell us where Varna is, and I might let you live? - All right they're downstairs, man. There's a party downstairs. - Sucker. (traffic overhead) - Damn. (gun firing) - Ladies. Nice clothes. Where you supposed to be, huh? - Death. (tires squealing) - Police. (laughing) - I'll rip your fucking balls off. (laughing) - Carl, is this part of the game? - Die motherfucker. (guns firing) - Come on! Let's go here, you fucking dykes. Come on. (gun firing) (guns firing) - You promised me total security, Carl. You promised me that. (gun firing) (gun firing) - Becky! (guns firing) (guns firing) (screaming) (somber organ music) - Jesse? (gun clicking) - No please. Please don't don't don't. Let me go. Let me go. I can give you money. I can give you millions. Millions, I can give you millions. Please don't kill me. (heavy rock music) (crying) - Freeze. Put the gun down, put the down now. - No way. (gun firing) - Ow, shit! Put the gun down, put it down. - So what are you gonna do, kill us both? You'd never make it, and you know it. Just let us go. All the bad guys are dead. They'll make you a big hero. - What about you Allison, huh? Justify killing my partner, you justify that shit. - I'm sorry. We never meant to kill cops, but it happened and there's nothing we can do about it, now. - I'm gonna waste her, Jen. I'm gonna do it. - You're gonna kill me and have her kill you, or are you gonna be smart? Use your head, let us go, come on. What's it gonna be? - Can't trust her. - No Chris, don't. Chris, it's gonna be okay. She's gonna let us go, right cop? You gonna put me away for killing my maniac husband? Or a sick fuck, like Carl Varna? Come on cop, you know what he's done. Tell me there's not a side of you that would've liked to join us. Come on, tell me that. You've got no choice. - Yeah. Go before it's too late. You just stay the fuck outta my city. (tense music) (sirens blaring) - Welcome, come in. - Hello, Ma. Pretty lady, just keep them coming. - Hey, aren't you that lady cop? The one that stops all those murders? - Yeah. - I saw you on TV. Oh, that was some story. Didn't you get shot of something? - Yeah, I did, but it's getting better. Thanks. - Well, all right girl. All right. - I like her, I see you like her too, huh? - I like her a lot. You know she's right. - What? - That was some story. - Come on Lou, don't start that now, we're having a good time. Let's just do it. - Billie, Billie, Billie, you know me. I'm never gonna put this to bed till you come clean. - Lou, let it go. - Hey, I got you promoted, right? That dog and pony show with the Maisels, I handled that for you, right? Huh? So indulge me for a minute. I know you heard all of this before. I got a street guy. He says he saw two people come out of Varna's pad right before the uniforms show up. To back that mud up, I get a fresh trail of blood, runs out the building and halfway up the street. Billie, I even had the forensic guys do DNA tests on the blood. You know what they give me? Huh? A negative with every stiff in that pad. Now, you're a detective, Detective. Where'd the blood come from? - Lou, what do you want from me, huh? What the hell do you want from me? Now, I gave your report, you signed it, you sent it up. What do you want? - No, you know I signed the report. I'll back you up on that. I want you to tell me the truth. Just tell me the truth, okay? It's me and you, we're having a couple drinks together. - You want the truth? - This ain't Internal Affairs. Tell me the truth. - The truth is, it's over. There's nothing else to say, Lou. It's over. (men mumbling) - Say Sally. Say Sally, the hips or the lips. (laughing) (country music on the jukebox) - [Sally] Can I get you anything? - Two coffees, black. - You watch man, I'm gonna get me a bitch tonight. Come on man, are you scared? Hey there ladies. How are y'all doing tonight? - Evening ladies. - Y'all ain't from around here now, are you? - Well, when you're through eating, what do you say we take you out and show you some of the sites, huh? - Grab a couple of beers, make a night of it? - Why don't you go fuck yourself? - [Man] Put him out. - Well, excuse me, miss? - What a bitch. She sure ain't friendly, huh Clyde? - Strike one. - Oh yeah. - What are y'all, a couple of fuckin' Lesbos? - Leave 'em alone, Clyde. - Shut your mouth, Sally. Unless you want me to have another talk with your old man? - We'll do it. Now go on, get. (laughing) - What are you laughing at? - Fuck them man. Only one way to handle this kind of bitch. - How's that, huh? - Drag their fuckin' dyke asses out back, and fuck their goddamn brains out. - Hell yes. What are you too smart-ass bitches think of that, huh? - Man's talking to ya. - Well? - Answer him. (rock music) (lyrics muffled)
