Do you want some more crumble? Drink some tea! Drink! It's OK! It's OK! Calm down! What is it? Be quiet! Calm down! Everything is OK! Be Calm. I am afraid... so afraid... - Calm down! Calm down! Come, Rest a little bit! Come! - No! Lie down! - No! - Lie down! Calm down. No! I'm back, mummy! Where are you? Mummy? Mummy! Where are you? Where are you? Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! The same dream again... what is this shit? Where is mummy now? Is she really dead? Maybe she's still alive. Maybe she'll come tonight. Stop talking nonsense and eat up! But you see them, too... - See what? Those childRen that died 10 years ago, in that bus accident... What are you talking about? - They don't understand that they are actually dead. They still believe that they aRe on their school excursion... Stop this nonsense! That's why you pee in the bed. When will I, finally, be able to put the pot away? Didn't you see them? Not a woRd about it! Forget it! Do you understand? And if somebody asks you about it, don't answer them. I will be good! I was never evil! Every day, I will try my best to do nothing bad. Please don't hurt me! Leave me alone! No! Help me, please! Help me, Nightmare Detective! Again with this shit... I'm cursed! Is it the morning or the afternoon? Who the hell are you? What do you mean by just walking in here? - Are you not Kyoichi Kagenuma? The one who can get into other people's dreams and release them from their nightmares? Please help me! Come into my dreams! I beg you! You must save me! Leave me alone! - Please, help me! Get out of here, I said! Damn! Who'll save me, anyway?! How I hate this! Father. Recently, I'm always dreaming of mother. Boy, where's that phone that I gave you? She always appears screaming in my dreams. She is afraid. What's with the phone?! How should I know whether you'Re alive or dead, if you don't answer your phone?! FatheR! Why was she so awfully scared of me? Why? She was afRaid of what she might do to you. She was not only afraid of you. She was afraid of everybody in this world. And because she was this way, she used violence against other people. And in the end it lead to her own death. I am afraid! Of what? There! There! I feel such fear! - But there's nothing there! What are you afraid of? Let's go on. - I am afraid. Do you see? - The biRd. - There! - Go on! Mummy. - Afraid. Mummy. I am afraid. Mummy. - Afraid. - Mummy. Mummy. - Afraid. - Mummy. Mummy. - Afraid. - Mummy. Afraid. - Mummy. - Afraid. Mr. Kagenuma! Help me! You're annoying me! - Mr. Kagenuma! What aRe you making there? Come down! But fast! - Help me! Help me, please! - Get lost - you're a nuisance! I've seen the devil! I haven't slept for days. No, no! - Please, I can't sleep! Stay here! Kyoichi! - Kyoichi! If you are better, go away. Yuko Kikukawa, a girl from my class, always comes to me in my dreams. - Stop this. I have no desire to hear... - Every night I dream of her. Kikukawa pursues me. This way! Don't worry, Kikukawa. The rabbit is not far away. Nothing has happened to him. We'll stay with you until we have found it. We had realised that Kikukawa was very anxious. My friends wanted to make her scared, just for fun! I took part. And in the end we could no longer stop it. Can you see it, Kikukawa? Is the rabbit there? Well, Kikukawa? Can you see it? She's so quiet. She's probably already found it. That's enough, right? Come on... we'll let her out. Inside, it was deadly quiet. Then we opened the door... Yuko? Kikukawa - we're sorry. Kikukawa? Where are you? She must be here somewhere. Where are you, Yuko? Kikukawa? - Have you hidden? Kikukawa? What's with you? Here she is. What's up with you? I'm afraid. Such fear. Fear. Such fear. When I saw her, her expression - it was... She had alReady had problems before, but we didn't know about it. In the summer camp we told horror stories - she was so afraid that she'd hide in the kitchen. And one time at the cinema, during a quite normal scene, she started to tremble... and tried to stab somebody with a pencil. I know that I did something awful to her. And since then I have dreamed about her almost every night. I'm so afRaid of these awful dreams, that I'm too scared to fall asleep. I'm afraid! I'm afraid! Fear! I beg you! Help me to get rid of them. So that she disappears from my dreams! TheRe is only one way to get rid of the nightmare. If you are Really sorRy, then you must go to her... and then sincerely ask her for forgiveness. It's as easy as that. Please, come along with me! Here's my number. Kikukawa's address is also on there. You'Re kidding me! - I beg you! - What's this good for?! I have no time for these childish little games. - No, please! I'm sorry. Now you must go. - Help me! Now clear out, once and foR all! - Why won't you help me? Don't call me a 'murderer'. What? - Shoo! Go! I only thought that word. How did you know? Whatever! Just go, go! - How do you know my thoughts? If I shouldn't read youR thoughts, then simply stay away from me! Hello! - Good morning. Oh. Before you go to school I must give you this. - What is it? I already told you that I must leave for three days on a business trip. Here's the housekeeping money. Do you have a moment? - We can talk as soon as I get back. I'm up to my ears with woRk. This must be finished before I go. And don't spend the money on some trinket, do you hear? So, have a good trip! - Yes, thank you. You yourself said this...? - He's asked you...? - Yes. If one is not suRe, one should shut up! - Clearly! Blunders lurk everywhere! - Yes. Good morning! You don't look like you've slept? No. Nor the night before. They're only dreams. Why are you so frightened by them? Did you meet that 'Kagenuma'? Yes, I did, like you told me to. It achieved nothing; he wouldn't listen to me. StRange... My fatheR said he is able to get rid of other people's nightmares. Whatever gave you that idea? Your dad is a policeman. And he told you such nonsense? - He did. Besides the usual routine police work, they also sometimes make use of 'unscientific' methods. This guy recently penetrated into the dreams of a culprit, and was able to solve the case. Your dad must have been playing a joke on you. - How come? He must have been drunk to tell you this shit! Am I right? - Yes, he was a little drunk... but he still knew his address. Akiko. Mutsumi. What if we went together to see her? To see Kikukawa. To apologise. She didn't come to school. Why do we need to apologise? - We'll go to her. Why? Is this really uRgent? Do we have to?! I think so. Firstly, Kikukawa is not coming to school. We are to blame for this. And secondly, she probably will come back some time. And what then? So what? What then? It could be that she'll tell the teacher. That would be dumb. If a bad entry appears on our reports... Exactly. We should apologise to her. Yukie! You are oversensitive. If you want to apologise, you can do so in your dream. I've already put it behind me. Was Kikukawa also in your dreams? - Yes. And I said to her: "I'm sorry". While searching through the box, I found a letter. It should have been sent long ago. And now comes an old word for 'September'. Here it says: "After the end of summer, after he had left..." Who is meant by "he"? Who has left? Here, "he"means the husband of the author. This work is the diary written by Kagero. So it has to do... ...with his personal life, to be clear. Next the sentence: "It should have been sent long ago." In this case, it means "sent to another woman", i. E. To the lover of Kaneie. Listen, Yukie! That had nothing to do with Kikukawa. It couldn't do. If we went to her and apologised... I really see no reason to. I have nothing to say to her. - Listen! I'll say it only once, but I'm serious. You'll come with me... or I'll strangle you. Scared! I'm scared. Shit! I'm going crazy. Mother - why did you do this to me? Mummy! Mummy! Mummy! Where are you? Mummy! Mummy! Where are you? I'm scared. Kikukawa... Who are you? My name is Yukie, and I'm your daughter's schoolmate. Yuko hasn't been to school for the last three days. I'm worried about her. You're a schoolmate? She's upstairs... but I don't think she will come down. Can I visit her? Why are you here? A fRiend, who helped to lock Yuko up, died in a strange way: My friend Mutsumi. I dreamed about her shortly before she died. In that dream Yuko threw something at Mutsumi... Let's go. Kikukawa? Yuko? Do you have a moment to speak with me? Could you open the door? MR. Kagenuma? What's wrong? Mr. Kagenuma... Hey, Akiko! Why didn't you come? Could you tell me? Why? Speak! Because... Just a second... Wait! Hold the line, OK? Yukie? You're at home. Hello, mother. Everything's fine here. Good. Any news? Not really. Just the usual. Good. I'll be back the day after tomorrow. See ya! Bye, dearest. Akiko? Are you there? I visited Kikukawa today. But she escaped through the window... I phoned her a few minutes ago, but she's still missing. Strange, or what...? I didn't tell you, but I've also been dreaming about Yuko... We're reporting from the new shopping centre. There's a massive crowd of people. This centre is aimed at the older customers. The Slogan here is "Relaxed and stress-free shopping." No shit! Don't think you can hide. You can't hide. Mum, please answer. Please. Hello, this is Yashiro... Mum, listen... Sorry, I can't answer the phone now... if you leave a message I will call you back. Please tell me! Has something happened to Akiko? We phoned this morning, but she's not answering now... I'm scaRed that something might have happened to her. Yes, Yes...! I'm scared. Kikukawa? I'm scared... so scared. Kikukawa? Kikukawa is gone. She will never come back. Another one of us is dead. Now there are two. I can't see Yuko Kikukawa anymoRe. She will appear in my next dream. She will appear and then... And then... she will not give you peace... Until you sincerely apologise to her. You have given her the worst moment in her life. How can you say that? You are like Yuko Kikukawa. You look impassive, but you have perspective. You think you are special? You murderer! Can I see heR? I want to see her face and say goodbye! Sorry, that's not possible. We've already closed the coffin. Stay there! Father. I need your help. Kyoichi. Did you know... that I ran away from your mother? She changed... shortly after your birth. No. For a short time after your birth... she was really happy. But sometime later she changed, drastically. She feared many things. And one day, you were one of those things... I tried to get out of her way, because she was so creepy. I couldn't help her. It's OK! There's nothing to fear. What are you afraid of? I can't stand this. I can't stand this. What could I have done? It made me sick. I couldn't go to work. I couldn't restrain my negative thoughts and feelings for her. Every time she was near me I was scared... that she could read my thoughts. I didn't know what do do, and couldn't help her. I'm still suffering from it all today. Hey... mummy? Is everybody in the world as frightened as you are? You know that? You can read my mind? You can see inside me? You too? You can hear what others think? I'm sick of it. I can't bear this any longer! Come here! I'm sorry. I didn't mean to hit you. Please, I'm sorry! I'm so sorry. Are you hurt? - Yes. - I'm sorry. I'm so sorry. Forgive me, please? Yes, theRe. That's great. Yes, yes, yes. Great. She's not here. She's gone and isn't back yet. Please go away and leave us alone. Well... would it be possible to see her room? So? Seen enough? She told me she really sees these things. These women too. Hey, mummy? Is everybody in the world as frightened as you are? I don't know when her fantasies started. I can only say that I'm so sorry for her. Damn you! Piss off! How long will you be here? Who is this guy? He makes me mad. Bugger off, you bum! You're nuts! Get lost, or...! Bugger off now, or I'll break your neck! Go! Come! Come. - You won't get us! Yes! Come quickly! You won't get us! We will be first! What's the matter? I just thought you were going to leave us. I won't leave. Don't worry. Where would I go? Strange... I never thought that you would come... Don't believe that I want to rescue you - I can't contact Kikukawa in the real world. But I want to meet her... Meet her in your dreams. Why? Why do you want to meet her? I feel if I don't meet her, then something worse will happen. I also feaR that I will lose control over myself. Guess what? Deep in my heart, I'm a bad person. You're right. I've acted horribly towards Kikukawa. And, what's worse, I wasn't alone. I incited the others to do it. Why? Why did you do it? I don't know. Every time I see Yuko, it prickles me, and I hate her so much. It has nothing to do with my mind. It's just a feeling that I can't suppress. And one time Kikukawa proudly told me... what I actually thought about her. From that moment on, I hated her more and more. That's why I locked her in. It could be that no one can help me. Could be... I think there must be a reason... for your behaviour. Yes? Do you? I think... when I meet heR, I will tell her to stay away from you. And that you'll have the opportunity to say sorry to her. Too late. What did you say? Just so I can enter your dreams. Don't think it's for fun! Say, how do you dispel a nightmare? I can't completely Remove them. - No? Doing it almost kills me... and it will also leave a tRace on the dreamer. If it gets too hard on me, I will suffer afterwards. If I can, I will avoid that. But theRe's also another reason why I want to meet this girl. This case sounds a lot like my mother. She was panicked all the time. She even feared her own son. She strangled me and tried to drown me. And then? - Shortly after this she hanged herself. Now I can drop off? Say, do you know what I'm actually thinking? Do you know what's running through my head right now? Do you... - Stop talking! Sleep! OK, I'll try! Yes? I'll count on you. I'll turn off the light. It's about time! She's in a deep sleep. Is someone there? Is someone there? No. Where are you? I don't know. How does it look there? So big... everything's so big. What do you see around you? I see nothing. - Not there. Turn around! A big stone. - A stone? Hold out your hand and touch the stone. How does it feel? Quite soft. - Then it's not a stone, it's an animal. It's a donkey. Look at him! Does he say anything to you? Listen caRefully to him! Listen! What did he say? Listen to him! - I don't want to... - And do exactly what he says! I can't... - You can't? What can't you do? - I can't walk. - Keep calm! Take a deep breath. What's he doing now? - He's going away. Stand up slowly! I can't. - You can. Try it! I can't. My legs don't work. Strange... I can't come in. Goddamn it! That's my dream! What the hell have I done? You know, I was so lonely. I felt totally alone. Dad had left after the divorce, and never showed up again. Mom woRks like crazy. She's not interested in me. I'm only in her way. Why did they give birth to me? I'm always lonely. I'm always on my own. I know: That's not an excuse. I'm so sorry that I was so nasty to you. It was wrong of me. Please forgive me, yes? Forgive me! I'm so sorry! Forgive me! I'm so sorry! Wait! - No, wait! Wait! I'm scared! So scared! No! - Kikukawa! - I'm scared! - Kikukawa! Scared! - Kikukawa! - Scared! So? Were you able to dispel my nightmare? I could sleep. Finally, I could sleep. Thank you. You'Re hot. I'll be right back. Shit... Go! - Come! - Sick Game! You have the key. Go! Please, no! Did she awaken for me? And one time at the cinema, during a quite normal scene she started to tremble and tried to stab somebody with a pencil. I'm scared. So scared! Go! Go! No! Wake up! Just wake up! Come on! Hello, this is Yashiro. Mum! I can't take your call at the moment... but if you leave a message I will call you back. No, no! That's not a dream. That's real. The doors and windows are closed! Don't go crazy! Pull yourself together! Nothing is happening. Just a crazy person at the front door! What do you want? I've apologised! No! No! Kikukawa! Afraid! I'm so afraid! Kikukawa! She wants to kill me. - She has not killed anyone. In your dream she doesn't feel hate... She's not a monsteR. She's just afraid. Kikukawa! Kikukawa! What did you see? - Nothing. - Who's there? - No one. Come, tell me! - No! I'm scared! You're disgusting. Why won't you speak? We can never know what thoughts run through your sick brain! I'll get pimples if I have to breathe the same air as you. You should just disappear. You're a waste of space! Go away! Get out of our sight! She won't open her mouth. She refuses to talk with me. Why did we give birth to such a child? - What did you want? Such a crazy child we didn't want. - What did you want? Bugger off! - Go away! We didn't want you! You suffered... you suffered so much. Didn't you? Then you must die. Say goodbye to this cruel world. I'm scared! So scared! I'm so scaRed! - Of what? What are you afraid of? - Scared! What are you afraid of? - Aren't you afraid? Of what? Aren't you afraid? - Of what? You must also be scared? - I'm not! Scared of what? Kyoichi... I'm sorry. It's life that's scaring me. Forgive that I gave birth to you. Can you forgive me? I will redeem you. I've always wanted to die, mum... Always. Fear! Fear! I don't want to be in this world. I don't want to live any longer. I'm so scared. I'm so scared of life! Fear! I'm so scared! I don't want to live any longer. I'm so scared! Scared! Mommy! Mommy! There! I can do nothing for you. Nothing at all. But I can stay by your side. I have nothing to lose in this world. I'm not scared! I will stay with you forever. Forever. I'm not scared! Mum, I'm here. Why didn't you kill me? Mum? Oh well. These methods are stone-aged. That's not really a lesson. Dead honest! Well. That's a harsh judgement. I have survived it. Say, what are you up to, Yukie? Mum... What's this shit for? I can't stand it any longer. I'm never going on another business trip. What were they thinking? I would rather pack it in. - Shut the hell up! Let's see how they manage without me! - I'm killing you... You too... now you can also hear what others are thinking. Now I hear the other voice of my mother. A voice such as I never heard before. What's keeping you? - I'm searching for the cards. - Always the same... Every time's the same with you! I thought you had them. I'll have to go to the pot. Don't tell me that you forgot the cards...? To wee. Come along! You know we must hurry. It's OK. I wish we had taken a cab. We could have been there by now. A cab?! Fine, then we'd also be broke! - Fine. You pay. Daddy! You bash the cards. It's always the same with you! Quick. I must finish. No! No! I was not evil! I was not evil! Every day I try haRd not to do nothing evil. No! Help me, please, Nightmare Detective! No! Help me, please, Nightmare Detective! Funny! Funny! That's a good one! Unusual, to laugh so much... Fantastic! Fantastic! Unbelievable! An absuRd show! What did you think? It's incredible. A great show! We're sitting in the best places. Incredible! Kyoichi? How are you feeling? Has the fever gone? What do you want to eat tonight? I always cook the same stuff. I don't know what I should cook anymore. What would you like? A hamburgeR. - A hamburger? OK. I'll make them. Mother... Not so many onions. I want more meat. Oh, I already chopped them. But it's OK - I'll eat the one with more onions in it.
