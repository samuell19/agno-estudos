"Attention. Attention." "The Berlin Broadcasting Station returning to the air." "As the All-Clear has just sounded." "You are ordered to resume your customary occupations." "Damage in tonight's air-raid has been negligible." "The authorities have the situation well in hand." "Attention. One more announcement." "Reichsminister Dr. Joseph Goebbels." "Is now on his way to one of the affected areas." "Dr. Goebbels will broadcast an eyewitness report." "From the actual scene of this latest demonstration of ruthless aggression." "While we wait." "Our orchestra cheers us with a recital of Beautiful Galatea by Franz Supp?." Herr Quandt. A gentleman. Herr Dr. Goebbels. I understand you come in answer to my advertisement. Yes, Herr Quandt. - Be seated please. Tell me what experience you have had in tutoring children. I presume you brought references. As a matter of fact, Herr Quandt. My experiences in tutoring children. Have been somewhat limited. You might really say that I .. Have had practically none. However, I believe that I have certain .. Pedagogical gifts. I see. How old are you, doctor, if I may ask? I was born in 1897. 1897? It is 1925 now. That makes you just .. I am exactly 28 years old. Yes. Well, thank you. Napoleon. Would have conquered the whole world. If he had been of the master race. But he was not German. You see, Harold. If Napoleon had been a true Aryan. Tall. Blond, blue-eyed. Nothing could have beat him. Ever. My mummy has blue eyes. Could she win the world? Your mother is certainly the loveliest type of German womanhood. But Herr Doctor. You are German. Why aren't you blue-eyed? You couldn't conquer the world. You couldn't. - Harold. Good morning, doctor. Tell me. Something's happened? Something good? Yes, my Maria. I've had a real bit of luck. You see, I can pay my rent now. I am to have an assured income. I have an advance already. - You have sold your play? I am so glad for you. What a wonderful feeling it must be. What fun. Come on. Let's sit down. Tell me all about it. It's not quite settled yet. There are a few details. May I pay my bill now? I am sorry I was behind. Though it was only three weeks this time. Thank you. In any event. The Colonel might have spared me the embarrassment of the .. Eviction note left on my dresser last night. Tell me. Who is to produce your play? Oh. We've talked too much about me. Let's talk about you. What a nice frock you're wearing. New, isn't it? I am glad you like it. I design all my own clothes you see. It was a toss-up for a long time whether I wanted to be a designer or an actress. And the stage won. Very fortunate for your future, Fr?ulein Brandt. Herr Levine, my teacher. Has promised to let me study Juliet. That makes me very happy. He's really a wonderful teacher, Herr Levine. I'm sure you will make a wonderful Juliet. Wonderful. I must be letter perfect for my audition tomorrow. Here. See here how she .. Yes. I understand. 'The first bud of love. By summer's ripening breath'. 'May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet'. 'Good night'. 'Good night'. 'As sweet repose and rest'. 'Come to thy heart'. 'As that within my breast'. 'Wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied'? 'What satisfaction cans't thou have tonight'? 'The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine'. 'I gave thee mine'. 'Before thou dids't request it'. 'And yet I would'. 'It were to give again'. 'Wouldst thou withdraw it'? 'For what purpose, love'? 'But to be frank'. 'And give it thee again'. Maria. Herr Doctor Goebbels? You will leave my house at once. I give you exactly one hour to pack your belongings and get out. And heaven help you if I ever see you near my daughter again. What's biting the doctor? I don't know. Something is. He never ordered brandy before. And I swear by this sacred symbol. The symbol of our party. And let the world mark my words. That I will not give up the struggle for Germany's future. Until I have restored our national honor. And made our fatherland. The guarantor of everlasting peace! Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Heil Hitler. Colonel Quandt. If Adolf Hitler ever gets enough power. I assure you Germany will be the strongest nation in the world. And peace will be secured for the next thousand years. Personally, as a Junker. I am not interested in a peace that would last a thousand years. I believe in Bismarck. Bismarck, who said that war should be the rejuvenating steel bath of a nation. And war must be our objective. What about the last war? That was not exactly rejuvenating. Was it? You talk like a defeatist. I tell you, Brandt. This is strictly confidential. The entire German army .. Is ready to follow any man who will give them the chance to fight again. And Adolf Hitler is that man. I have asked you to come to Berlin. Because you represent the liberal democratic press of Germany. There is no greater political power in the country. Than is assembled in this room at this minute. I want you to mark this day. The 24th of September 1929. As the day on which we gathered to consider a question. Of utmost gravity. Gentlemen, I will not mince words. You are well aware. That I refer to the subversive activities of the Nazi party. I assure you. That if these political hoodlums succeed in their objective. It will mean the extinction. Of the personal. The political. And the religious liberties guaranteed by our constitution. If you really believe that, Heinrich. We should all sell out then. Set up shop in the United States. And you know, my friend. Barking dogs never bite. Unfortunately, Hartong, this is not to be passed off with a proverb. Krause. Will you please get me the folder marked 'Confidential' from the files? Moreover. If we had only had that hysterical braggart Hitler to contend with. The situation would not be half so critical. But Hitler is not alone. I do not need to tell you gentlemen that I refer to Doctor Paul Joseph Goebbels. He is the shrewdest. And the most unscrupulous propagandist the world has ever seen. A man whose ruthlessness and cruelty knows no limits. A man who does not stop at murder. To accomplish his one objective. Power for the Nazi party. Let me give you a brief outline. What has happened in the last 24 hours in Berlin alone. Therefore, I have recommendations to make which I urge you consider .. As strictly confidential. Herr Wallburg. Perhaps you had better postpone this a minute. Oh no. Krause has been with us for 23 years. He is absolutely loyal. Thank you, Mr Wallburg. That is very gratifying. Do you care for a drink? - No thank you. I'll be brief. I suggest first. That as newspapermen. We give up our milk-and-water neutrality. And adopt a policy of open hostility. Second. I suggest that we urge the government. To form a republican home guard. For the protection of the state and the constitution. Let us show them that .. Democracy is not only an ideal. But an instrument. Not only a ballot box to express the will of the people. But a flaming sword to enforce it. Gentlemen, I would like to hear your reaction. My dear Wallburg. My answer is an emphatic 'No'.. I can think of nothing more ill-advised than the course you recommend. We would justifiably lose the confidence of our readers. To say nothing of alienating the affections of our advertisers. Besides, I am willing to take any bet. That ten years from now in 1939. Even the names of your Hitler and Goebbels will be completely forgotten. Gentlemen. I wish to go on record as agreeing one hundred percent with Heinrich Wallburg. It is my firm conviction. That at this moment you have failed in the public trust. You have betrayed the people of Germany. Moreover, gentlemen. You are signing your own death warrants. This is a coincidence. Your name is there on my desk. I was going to find out if you were still in Hanover. Please be seated. Thank you. Well, what have you been doing all this time? I didn't realize it was you until they announced 'Brandt'. It is long since. - Yes. Yes. It must be four years. Almost five. I was really curious to see you. That's why I came. How nice. Well, you .. are really a woman now. And more beautiful than ever. Amazing what has become of the little Juliet. No doubt you have found many Romeos since then? More persuasive ones perhaps than an insignificant playwright. I still remember how you laughed. And Colonel Brandt. He threw me out of the house like a dog that had misbehaved. Let's forget that. Forget? We Nazis pride ourselves or our memory, you know. Even when we are at the top. We remember our experiences at the bottom. Anyway, people don't laugh at Dr. Goebbels nowadays. Some even consider him dangerous. Yet, in all modesty, I may say I have accomplished a great deal. And I will accomplish a good deal more. What about you, Maria? My hopes have not turned out too well. So far. I seem to be stuck here in Hanover. Still doing small parts in a small city. Things looked bright when I left Berlin. But somehow .. No matter how hard I tried. So you never got a chance to really show what you can do? No. Never. Nothing. - That's too bad. Too bad. But don't give up, Maria. Your luck will change. Eight. Nine. That is all. Maria, you were wonderful. Nothing short of a miracle. Herr Kremer. Herr Kremer. Did you count? Nine curtains. I am so happy. How did you like me? - Very creditable. Not at all bad, eh Weber? How did you like me as kinsfolk in both houses? Incomparable. Come, my dear. Papa and Herr Levine are waiting. Her first performance and she packed the house. I don't get it. - No? You don't? How wonderful, explained the princess. It's all gold and marble. And look. What beautiful birds. They will sing for you day and night. But where is Prince Charming? 'Here at last is the noble prince'. Said the bear. And as the prince. Now restored. To his old beautiful form. Steps down from the throne to greet her. The little princess sees. That all the beasts of the field. And the birds .. The door. In the air. Get out. What is happening, gentlemen? Please, you interrupt my broadcast. Attention. Attention. Men and women of Germany. At ten o'clock this morning. President Von Hindenburg. Appointed Adolf Hitler. Chancellor of the Reich. This thirtieth day of January 1933. Marks the rise of the Swastika. Over all of Germany. At this moment, hundreds of thousands of Germans. "Are giving themselves over to indescribable joy." "Knowing that a new era of peace and prosperity." "Of decency and self-respect." "Has begun for the fatherland." Listen to this. 'Hamburg'. 'Violent riot in harbour district'. 'Between Nazis and stevedores'. '53 casualties'. 'Four dead'. 'Numbers still mounting'. 'Police efforts'. 'To control situation'. 'Failed'. Fr?ulein Schumann. - Yes, Herr Wallburg? Get me Hamburg on the wire please. The Observer. Herr Lansburger. Those dirty swine. Those filthy scum. They got me for refusing to Heil Hitler. Five of them jumped on me. I guess I must have knocked a couple of them out. But more kept coming. They kicked me in the face. And one must have hit me over the head. I guess they thought they'd finished me. Here. Swallow this. Get me a gun. Get me a gun. I'll kill them. I will kill them. - Quiet. Hold steady. That won't get you anywhere. Don't you think Frau Hartmann is too young to be a widow? What about those two youngsters of yours? Fr?ulein Schumann. Call a taxi please. And see that he gets home. I'll see to it. Hello? Hold it just a minute. Herr Wallburg, I have Hamburg on the wire. Hello Lansburger? Wallburg speaking. Yes. I know. It came over the tape. Send a cab to the Wallburg building. Entrance 5. Yes. Right away please. I was afraid of that. A mob has been there. They wrecked the linotypes and smashed all the windows. What about you, Lansburger? Are you alright? What about the police? Good. That is most important. Tell me. Didn't you call the police? Oh? You really believe that? The police came too late. Deliberately. Tell me. Did you get the morning edition out? I'll tell you what to do. You take .. Sorry, I will have to interrupt this conversation. How is it now? Think you can make it alright? Take it easy now. Well, Hommer. The fight is over. For all of us. I know. Take care of him please. Ask Frau Hommer to keep me informed. Fr?ulein Schumann. Get our branch in Frankfurt on the direct wire. Adler's office. Here it is. 'Adolf Hitler has just appointed Doctor Paul Joseph Goebbels'. 'Reichsminister of propaganda and public enlightenment'. 'Dr. Goebbels will immediately take over the German radio'. 'The press, the arts, the theater'. 'And the motion picture industry'. ''This appointment assures the development'. 'Of that national culture to a peak ..' 'Hitherto unknown'. Says Goebbels. For us of the press, the Goebbels appointment amounts to just this. They are signing our death warrant after the execution. Ready with your Frankfurt call, Herr Wallburg. Well Adler, how are things down at Frankfurt? What's that? Eh? Can you speak a little louder? I can't hear you. You know some friends .. Dropped in. Hello Adler. What's happened? Can you hear me? Why don't you answer? In heaven's name, what ..? Herr Wallburg. I have orders to arrest you. Krause. I am sorry. You know the interest of the Third Reich stands above everything and everyone. You must understand the new era. That's all I can say. - Let me see your warrant. Well. As a matter of fact. We carry our warrants here. You understand? I understand. One more. That's all. One more. One more. Listen boys. Tomorrow, put your money on Lohengrin. On the nose. He'll pay 100-1. Did the horse tell you? No. I told the horse. I am the new racing commissioner. Excuse me. Alright, Hanussen. You know what your prophesies are to be tonight. I've instructed Jenny very carefully. She knows exactly what she has to say. I understand, Herr Minister. You can depend on me. Surely you know that I am prepared to answer any questions. Very good. Stop that music. Ladies and gentlemen. Ladies and gentlemen, it is hardly necessary for me .. To introduce Hanussen, our greatest clairvoyant. A man who actually predicted our rise to power. Tonight. You have the privilege of witnessing Hanussen's supernatural gifts. Hanussen, please. Ladies and gentlemen. Please settle down for just a moment. Would one of the ladies be good enough to act as my medium? Elsa, you go and do it. No. I couldn't do it. I'd laugh and spoil it. Go on, Elsa. This is your chance. - Please do, Elsa. My mother always said was a little psychic. Which of the ladies will it be? I would like to try. - Fine. Come right ahead. Don't be afraid. Come right ahead. Just sit in this chair. Sit down. Relax please, Fr?ulein. Relax completely. A little less light please. Ladies and gentlemen. This young lady is now ready to answer questions. Now who will be the first? Tell me. When is my birthday? Your birthday falls on .. February the 28th. She is right. What will I be doing February 28th? I see you standing on a street. You are watching something. There are other people. A great many other people. All looking at a building. A very large building. It's in flames. It's the Reichstag. The Reichstag is in flames. Well, that's a grand bit of news. Let's try for something more cheerful. Hanussen, let her tell me something about .. About. Ask her which will be the happiest moment of my life. I hope that it's still ahead. Herr Minister Goebbels asks which will be the happiest moment of his life. The happiest moment of his life. It is several years from now. The spring. A beautiful day. Warm. A flag flies from a great steel structure. The Eiffel Tower. It is the Swastika. It's Paris. The windows are all closed. The streets are deserted. I see a huge black limousine. You are riding in that car. You're looking right and left. You are smiling. It is the happiest moment of your life. Paris. And this time we'll do it. First thing I do? I go to Maxims. This time we'll teach them a lesson. I propose a toast. To Paris. Herr Hanussen. I would like to ask a question. Alright. Just one more. I would like to know where I will be ten years from tonight. Where will this gentleman find himself in ten years? I see an endless plain. Then. Sand and mud. Desert. I see countless thousands of soldiers. You are there. You are in command. Well, well. My congratulations, Herr Rommel. So, you asked me to conquer Africa. Bravo. Erwin Rommel. The old fox. Well. I am something of a clairvoyant myself. I would like to venture a prediction. It's very simple. Mark my words. Today, Germany is ours. Tomorrow .. the whole world. Hanke, please. - Yes, Herr Minister. Hanke, I have a few more items I want attended to immediately. I'm not at all satisfied with the people's response to our .. Anti-Catholic campaign. Get in touch with the literary department. Tell them I want them to work up some stories. For instance, about .. Embezzled poor-box funds in .. Say, Munster. In Munster. And here's something that must be handled very discreetly. Get in touch with Herr Defune. Tell him I want Frau Maria Brandt. Of the Hanover Municipal Theater. Brought to Berlin for a screen test. And that I wish to see the results personally. Yes, Herr Minister. Thank you. I am sorry. I forgot. Here you are. Thank you. Papa. I beg your pardon. I thought you were my father. I mean, I expected my father to be .. Isn't Colonel Brandt at home? Ah, you are Fr?ulein Brandt. No. I'm afraid the colonel won't be back before six o'clock. You must have thought I was crazy jumping at you like that. I hadn't written my father that I was coming, you see. I meant to surprise him. I am the one who is crazy. Blocking the door like this. I have not introduced myself. I am Dr. Hans Traeger. I am your father's new tenant. How do you do. How do you do. Here. Let me help you. No. I'll take this. It's light. - Alright. I'll take these two. Come right in. I'm sure your father will be glad to see you again. I still do not understand. You mean my father actually paints these doll heads? But why? Didn't he write to you, that he had lost his pension? That was a lifetime pension from the government. Yes. From the former government. Awful. Awful. Papa is a retired military man and he .. Ah well. I must straighten up my room so I can move in for a while. Is this only a visit? Aren't you staying? Whether I stay or not depends entirely on the Youth Studio. They called me for a screen test. And I am superstitious. So I bought a round-trip ticket. Well, gentlemen. Let me have your reaction to Fr?ulein Brandt's screen test. A very talented young woman. Excellent. And very beautiful. Of course we must remember, gentlemen, that .. Her experience has been limited to the legitimate stage. However, I think we might risk giving her small parts. For a year or two. I disagree completely, Herr Korel. I may say I'm not altogether surprised to find your procedure so antiquated. I find Fr?ulein Brandt quite ready for a leading part. For stardom in fact. For instance, I can very easily imagine her as Gloria in Queen For a Night. If you will think it over intelligently .. I am sure you will agree. Goodnight. And you won't have to worry about the public's acceptance of Fr?ulein Brandt. I can assure you she will be extremely popular. Heil Hitler. - Heil Hitler. Do you know it is after midnight? Aren't you going to be late? - No. The benefit show is on now but I don't go on until one o'clock. Besides, they're going to call for me. I wish they wouldn't come at all. I hate these official benefits. But you know the Nazis. They just won't take no for an answer. They're broadcasting the show now. Shall I find it for you, father? No, dear. They have some real talent there tonight. Yes I know. I don't want to listen to that rubbish. I'll tune in just before you go on. Now, papa. Straining your eyes on a jigsaw puzzle is exactly what you should not be doing. Darling, this doesn't hurt my eyes. It's a real relaxation for me. Not like painting doll babies, you know. Papa. Let's forget those awful days. That's what started your eye trouble. There is nothing the matter with my eyes, woman. I can still see I have a very beautiful daughter. You're a darling. And I still think I have the most gallant father in the world. [ Car horn ] There they are now. Well. Here darling. Thanks, papa. Don't wait up for me. You know, they drag out these benefits endlessly. Have you got your key? Goodnight, darling. Night. Herr Reichsf?hrer Himmler. One moment please. Minister Dr. Goebbels is calling you. Hello? This is Himmler speaking. Listen, Himmler. You know that list of yours for tonight? That we were discussing? There is one more person I would like you to .. Take care of. The usual thing. Enemy of the Third Reich. Defamation of party leaders. Subversive activities. His name is Colonel Eberhart Brandt. Eberhart Brandt. Retired. Brandt. Colonel Eberhart. Know the address? Friedrichstrasse. - What's that? Friedrichstrasse 14. 14 Friedrichstrasse. Well, Himmler? I hope I see you soon. I don't know that I will be able to see you for some time. As a matter of fact I'm a pretty busy man these days. I have quite a list here. You would be surprised to know how many of us have 'special friends'. [ Telephone ] Von Metzfeldt. Where is the doctor? Tonight? I don't know. What do you want him for at this hour of the night? Listen, Hanke. You have got to find him. His name is on the list for tonight. Metzfeldt? You're positive there's no mistake? I have a photostat of the list. Goebbels' name is right at the top. Now get this, Hanke. Tell him to stick to Hitler. Tell him, no matter what, he has to stick until 3 o'clock Wednesday morning. That's the deadline on executions. It's his only hope. Tell Goebbels to get to that plane. He's got to fly with Hitler. Hanke. I have to go now. I am being tailed. Hanke speaking. Is Dr. Goebbels at home? You don't happen to know where I can find him? Thanks. Oh, it is beautiful. Oh, it's lovely. Let me fix it. Now let's see. How does it work? There you are. Really, Paul. You are an angel. But you should not have spent all that money. You really shouldn't. Where does it come from? Where does it come from? What do you mean? Oh, the necklace? From the best jeweller in Berlin. [ Telephone ] Let it ring. It will stop in a moment. Who? Oh, him? No. I've not seen him. Not for almost a week. Vera. Herr Hanke on the phone wants to know if you're meeting Dr. Goebbels tonight. No. Not tonight. I'm seeing him tomorrow night. Anita, is the doctor here? I'm sorry. He doesn't happen to be here. Supervisor? This is the propaganda ministry. I'm not getting an answer on Bismarck 2326. Check that wire immediately please. You know, Jenny. I have really no right to be away from my desk tonight. [ Telephone ] Fr?ulein Hartman. Fr?ulein Hartman. Is Herr Dr. Goebbels there? Hello? Hello? Is Dr. Goebbels there? Dr. Goebbels? Hanke, is that you? What's the matter? Von Metzfeldt just called. Herr Doctor. You are on Himmler's list. Tonight. Herr Minister Goebbels. Is the Fuhrer expecting you? You know that insurrection is in the air. At this hour of danger my place is at the side of my Fuhrer. I warn you. In the interests of the Reich, whatever you may be called upon to do tonight. Must be carried out in the strictest secrecy. Any one of you. Disregarding this order. Either by direct statement. Or by implication. Will be shot immediately. In time. I cannot help but know that .. That being a movie actress has real disadvantages. It often seems. Colonel Eberhart Brandt? Yes. What can I do for you? - We want to talk to you. Won't you come in? [ Radio broadcast ] Be seated please. I will turn this down a little bit. That is my daughter talking. There is something you wish to say? You might call it that. It's a message from Colonel Goebbels. Well, that's done. Let's go. Poor little birdy couldn't sleep a wink. "So won't you all. Please." "Empty your pockets and your purses and give all." "Every Mark, every pfennig that you can possibly spare." "Let us give largely and gladly." "And gracefully in the name of our warm, comfortable homes." "And of our loved ones." "Who live in." This terrible thing would never have happened. If I had been in Berlin at the time. If the Fuhrer hadn't insisted I go with him on his secret mission that night. I would have heard about Himmler's plan. I could have stopped him of course. And your poor father would still be with us. I know there is nothing I can say to console you. Even the most sincere words sound empty at a time like this. I know too. Despite your many friends and your great success. You must be feeling very alone in this world. And it's not a kind world, Maria. I can tell you that. I wish you would try to understand that I am really your friend. Perhaps the most devoted friend you have left. I don't know of any more subtle way of telling you. But the simple truth is, I love you. I always have. You don't understand what you mean to me. Your beauty. Your way of talking. The way you move across a room. Maria. I have loved you ever since. Don't answer too quickly, Maria. I can make you great. I can make you the most famous. The most envied woman in all Germany. In all of Europe. Think. Think who and what I have become. Maria. Let me be. Your friend. Thank you, Dr. Goebbels. But you must understand clearly and at once. I'm not interested in the kind of .. Friendship you suggest. Not even to become the most envied woman in the whole world. I am quite satisfied with what little success I have achieved. 'What little success I have achieved'. It may interest you to know you have achieved nothing. Exactly nothing. It was I who achieved for you. Where do you think you would be if it weren't for Dr. Goebbels, eh? I'll tell you where. In the wings of a theater in Hanover. Waiting to speak the 3-line part that you have achieved. Maria. I have undertaken to make you great. Believe me. By the same token I can .. You see, Dr. Goebbels. I know now what you really are. My father knew it ten years ago. He acted accordingly. Yes, Herr Minister? Hanke. Write a letter to Youth Films and Korel. I want him to inform Maria Brandt. That her contract with Youth Films. Will not be ratified by the ministry of propaganda. And make it clear to her that she's no longer eligible. For any employment .. in the German .. Motion picture industry. Thank you. We will agree we're an unholy three. There is no doubt that the world has found out. I'm a wolf. I'm a rat. I'm a vulture. We step people under. We plunder and plunder. We're dauntless and dashing and daring. And those who oppose us, repose meet their roses. I am Hitler. I'm Goebbels. I am G?ring. Heil, heil. Heil to Herr Goebbels. And gets him his medals. He shouts: Kill all the rebels. I'll hang the red devils. Heil, heil. People of the Third Reich. Heil. - Heil. When you feel like a fool. Like you feel. Heil. Heil. - Heil. We are lucky that we can still joke about it. I should say we are. In free Austria. Revolting. Just wait. Next year they'll sing to another tune. Is there something else you would like? No. We're leaving. How much is it please? That will be 3 shillings and 40 groschen. Then we'll say goodbye. Goodbye, Herr Doctor. - Goodbye, Herr Veiser. I don't believe it. Maria Brandt. What are you doing in Vienna? Doctor Traeger. Hans Traeger. - You can't leave now. This is an occasion. We've got to celebrate this. This is Herr Dr. Traeger - Frau Bendler. Glad to know you, doctor, I'm sure. - Frau Bendler. Dr. Traeger is a friend of mine. I haven't seen him since I left Berlin. How nice. I think I'll run along, Maria. Please stay. It isn't very late. Yes, do. No. I must be going. You stay and celebrate. It's has been a pleasure meeting you, Dr. Traeger. Frau Bendler. - Goodbye. Goodbye, Frau Bendler. This is one of the nicest surprises I've ever had. I was sitting right over there. Shall we go back? Tell me, why haven't I heard from you? Why didn't you answer my letters? You mean to tell me you didn't get a letter from me? No. Well. There's only one reason for that, Dr. Traeger. And what's that? I never wrote one. A nice girl. Now, suppose you tell me why. Well, that isn't too easy. You know, Dr. Traeger. Plenty of actresses have had their future swept away. I realised that. But I lost my career. Past, present and future in one blow. I knew only one thing. I wanted to run away. I wanted to run just as far as I could get just as fast as I could go. I never wanted to see anyone or anything who had any part of my past. Not ever. I see. I'm sorry now though. About you that is. Perhaps if you'd write me just one more. I will do it. And this time I will deliver it myself. But I don't want to see Dr. Traeger. Now, Maria. You're acting like a selfish child. You can't blame a doctor for breaking some engagements. He told you it was for emergency cases. Now, this time, you are the emergency case. Once more please. Exhale. A fine pair of lungs. You seem to be in excellent condition. All you have is a regulation head cold. You'll be on your feet in a few days. Anything else troubling you? Well. I think my nerves are a little shaky. I haven't been sleeping too well. Alright. Maybe we'd better check the heart. Lie down please. You know, Hans. You have a few grey hairs. Maria, please. How can I listen to your heart if you keep talking? Alright. Alright. I won't say another word. Why don't you grow a great big beard? It will make you look more dignified. There's nothing wrong with your heart. It's just a little rapid right now. I'll have a look at your eyes. They are brown. Hadn't you noticed?: Nothing exceptional. Your general condition is really excellent. But what about my heart? You said yourself it was too rapid. I'll give you something to take care of it. Too bad I've taken up so much of your valuable time, Herr Doctor. I realize I'm not exactly an emergency case. That's quite alright. I am sorry. I have to rush now. I'll call you tomorrow to see how you are feeling. Goodbye, Maria. You'll be alright. My dance, I believe, Fr?ulein Brandt. Enchanted, Dr. Traeger. Enchanted. Sorry. I have to see your papers. What's up? What's this all about? A man from the Home Guard has been killed. You know. Political disagreement. We're looking for the fellow who did it. Say. Foreigners. Aren't you? Germans. Yes. Heil Hitler. Hans. It's like a nightmare. An Austrian policeman saying: 'Heil Hitler'. - Yes. "Attention Austrians. Attention." "Our country is in danger." "There is only one way to preserve our independence." "Give Chancellor Schuschnigg your vote of confidence in Sunday's plebiscite." "Stand firmly behind your government." "Long live Austria." They haven't left us much of our gay evening, have they? I am afraid not. All that seems a little foolish now. Do you mind if I change into something a little less festive? Go ahead. Poor Maria. I feel almost as if it were my fault that we .. Shush. Hans. There's nothing wrong in the whole world tonight. Here we are together because we didn't care to go out. We wished to have one quiet evening alone. Well. Tonight our wish has been granted. And do you know who granted it? No. Who? The fairy Sylvana. Oh? I doubt that she's your type. When I was a little girl she lived in the fireplace in my nursery. She had the regulation equipment. A wand. A star in her brow. And of course, three wishes up her sleeve. Three wishes? That is exactly the lady I wanted to meet. Let me see now. Alright. I've made mine. All three of them? All three of them. I'm good at it. They won't come true if you tell them. I don't mind telling mine. That is, one of them. I'd love to travel. And you know where? I've always wanted to go to Switzerland. Switzerland? Oh, wait. Can you see your way to taking along a poor fellow who's fresh out of wishes? I didn't tell you my other two wishes. Did I? [ Telephone ] I wonder who that could be. The fairy Sylvana. I had better answer it. That was the police. They're still looking for the man who killed the soldier. Don't look at me. I have a delightful alibi. But I have to look at you. They said no-one is allowed to leave the house before 6 o'clock in the morning. Ah. This isn't bad at all. If you can spare a blanket I will be very comfortable. It's a bit short. Don't be surprised if you wake in the morning looking like a pretzel. I won't complain as long as you recognise me. I'll get you a blanket. Maria. You asleep? No. I am not. I thought you were. No. I wasn't either. Neither was I. Oh. Still snowing? Yes. Looks like it will keep right on. You know, Maria. I was thinking about Switzerland. A great honeymoon country, Switzerland. Famous for it. Did you hear me, Maria? I said, Switzerland was a great country for honeymoons. I read that. I read it in Baedeker. Baedeker or no Baedeker. That's the kind of thing I'd like to prove for myself. Baedeker says: 'Honeymoon couples abound in the famous Swiss resorts'. Well. First thing tomorrow we buy a Baedeker. Maybe. Maybe we'll abound there ourselves. It's almost morning, Hans. I think we had better get some sleep. I know, darling. But remember. We have a date with Baedeker first thing tomorrow. I'll remember. Goodnight. Goodnight. "Attention. Attention." "This is the Vienna Broadcasting Station." "Men and women of Austria." "At this moment German troops are pouring across the Austrian border." "German military planes are landing at the Vienna airport." "Stand by for further orders." "Heil Hitler." Here is the ironing, Maria. I'm afraid it's still a little damp. Is there any more I can do for you? Yes, Frau Bendler. The most important thing. Please take care of my husband while I'm gone. See he doesn't dash off without his breakfast every morning. Don't worry about the doctor, my dear. I'll keep an eye on him. Here is your robe, darling. Thank you, dear. I'm all thumbs today. If I only get to Berlin on time. I hope you don't overestimate the influence of General Ulrich, Maria. You really think he can prevent Levine being deported to Poland? Ulrich is my only hope. He adored Papa. Do you know what it would mean if they sent Levine to a concentration camp? He would never survive those horrors. Not even a week. [ Telephone ] Hello? Yes. This is Frau Dr. Traeger. Thank you. What time does the train leave? Eight-thirty. When the Gestapo came for him. He didn't answer his doorbell. You know how they are. They broke the door in. And there he was. Right where he always sat. I guess. His poor old heart just couldn't take any more. Yes. Here is your passport. You applied for a return visa to Vienna? - Yes. I have. You see, I had to leave Vienna in such a hurry I had no time to think about it. Yes. These things happen. Well, Frau Traeger. I had to submit your application to the minister of propaganda. Your request has been denied. You are not permitted to return to Vienna. But I don't understand. Vienna is my home. I live there. Sorry. But your father had a record as a political criminal. And you. You were dishonorably discharged from the German film industry. By order of the minister of propaganda. He is the only one who can clear your record. Sorry. I shall have to confiscate your passport. Next please. Hans. Darling. I've never been so happy to see anyone in all my life. How did you manage to get away from Vienna and the hospital? How did you find time? How did you know I wanted you so? Telepathy, dear. Besides. Don't you know what day it is? I do know, and very well, Dr. Traeger. It is February 23rd 1943. The fourth anniversary of our wedding. How terribly, terribly sweet of you to be here. Darling, I love you four times as much as I did four years ago. Is there that much love in the world? Hans. Hans. What is it, darling? What are you doing up? What time is it? I got a letter from the passport office. I'm to be there at nine o'clock. It must mean they've granted my visa. That would be wonderful. Then we could still go to Vienna tonight. I have to hurry though if I'm to be there on time. Turn over and take a little catnap, huh? I love you. If I get my visa I'll call you the first thing. Now, if you will please sign here. A beautiful city, Vienna. I was there myself before the Anschluss. As a tourist. You understand. Thank you. May I use your telephone? Certainly, Frau Dr. Traeger. Right over there. Hotel Excelsior. Dr. Traeger please. 342. Dr. Traeger is not in. Is there any message? This is Frau Doctor Traeger. I wonder if you would .. Just a minute, Frau Doctor. I'll connect you with the desk. Hello? Hello? Frau Doctor Traeger? I am sorry to have to tell you. Dr. Traeger was arrested by the Gestapo just a few minutes ago. Oh no. So, you are from Heidelberg, young man. A lovely city, Heidelberg. I studied there once. Well. You will soon be back again enjoying a good glass of wine. I can only say that I envy you. Lying there with the knowledge. That you have had a part in Germany's glorious struggle. To free the oppressed peoples of the world. From the corruption of the so-called democracies. Liar. You filthy liar. I must see you, Herr Minister. Immediately. Well. If it's that important. Perhaps we might talk in there. Wait here. I came here because .. - How did you know I was here? I heard you arrange it when I was in your office asking about my visa. Oh. I think I can guess what brought you here, Maria. About the traitor. Your husband has been arrested and you suspect that I had a hand in it. Well. As a matter of fact. I have. But there is no hurry. Nothing has happened to him yet. It's only ten minutes past twelve. The Gestapo have not even started to question him. How could you? Alright, Maria. Here is the situation. From the very first moment I met you, I .. Shall we say. Fell in love with you. Quite madly, I assure you. But. I failed to win you. You are the one open account in the ledger of my life. Now I am prepared to .. Close that account. I am willing to guarantee the safety of your husband. Listen, carefully. Have you noticed? The doctor's lucky star seems to wearing a little thin around the edges lately. Well, he's in a tight place. You try scampering all over Germany telling the people how happy they are. Well, Maria? You leave me no choice. The rest is very simple. Your husband will be released within the hour. You will tell him you have received permission for both of you .. To go to Switzerland. You will travel with him as far as the Swiss border. There you will be told how to leave the train without your husband's knowledge. You will see with your own eyes that he crosses safely into Switzerland. Then. You will be brought back to Berlin. Fifteen minutes to the border. Passport inspection. Have your luggage ready please. How long does the train stop at Basle? 60 minutes. Exactly one hour. Luggage ready please. Fifteen minutes to the border. Passport inspection. What about .. When do we take her off the train? I have special orders. Do nothing until I tell you to. Have you noticed those two fellows outside our door? They've been there most of the trip. Yes. I've noticed. Typical Nazi faces. Darling, you are dreaming with your eyes open. Climbing mountain peaks already. Tell me, Hans. Haven't we always been happy together? Truly, profoundly happy? Of course we have, darling. Haven't I told you hundreds and hundreds of times? And now in a new country with fifty years ahead of us we'll be .. Would it be too much trouble? Would you help me? Certainly. No trouble at all. There you are. Thank you so much. Are you two going on into Switzerland? - Yes. We are. My, my. Aren't you fortunate? Darling, I know just what we'll do. As soon as we get to Zurich, we check in at the hotel and go to the restaurant. We'll have all the whipped cream we want and then we'll order. How long before the train starts? Three minutes, darling. Do you realize the Swiss border is no more than a hundred yards from here. Exactly three minutes, Hans? Exactly. That is. Now it's two minutes and 45 seconds. What are you looking for, Maria? Is something troubling you? They have gone. Who? - Those two men. I don't see them anywhere. That's just too bad. Do you miss them? All aboard. All aboard. How long before we start now? Precisely one minute and 35 seconds. Tell me, Hans. Do the trains always start exactly on time? This one certainly does. They're closing the doors now. Hans. We are moving. No, no. That's the other train that is moving. We are about to. Do you know what I want to do? The very first thing in Zurich? I want to go to a church. Because I think that .. - Herr Dr, Traeger? Yes. What is it? Sorry to trouble you, Herr Doctor. The officials wish to see you again for a moment. Something about the signature on your money transfer, I think he said. Can you come with me please? It's just the third compartment down. This way please. Excuse me, darling. I'll be back in a minute. Hans. Hans. Steady, Maria. Don't let your nerves run away with you. Just think of that whipped cream in Zurich. Frau Dr. Maria Traeger? Just one more signature please, Herr Doctor. Then everything will be in order. Herr Dr. Traeger. Excuse me. I was just thinking about my wife. She always wanted to see Switzerland. Naturally, naturally. Believe me. It was fatherly concern for the welfare of each and every soldier in the ranks. That prompted the Fuhrer to relinquish the city of Stalingrad rather .. Than unnecessarily to imperil one life of .. To .. Imperil unnecessarily. The life of .. a single German soldier. We interrupt Dr. Goebbels' speech for technical reasons. Keep tuned to this station for further orders. Where is Dr. Goebbels? He will be late for his broadcast. He's been in there for quite a while now. I'm sorry to disturb you, Herr Minister. It is time for your broadcast. Alright. Let's get on with it. Attention, attention. The Reichsminister Doctor Paul Joseph Goebbels. Will now speak to you. Men and women of Berlin. Rumour-mongers. Gossips. Foreign agents in the pay of our enemies. Will try to tell you. Terrible and irreparable damage has been done. In tonight's attack by air. I am speaking to your from a house in the so-called .. 'Devastated area'. I can assure you. The damage is still negligible. It's hardly worth mentioning. Let the gentlemen in Washington and London. And the leaders of the other so-called United Nations not delude themselves. We have made Europe a fortress so impregnable. That never. And I repeat. Never will an enemy set foot on any part of European soil. ..r-o-s..
