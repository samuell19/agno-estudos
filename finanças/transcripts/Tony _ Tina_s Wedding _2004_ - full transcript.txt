Yeah, cause otherwise I might barf and... Okay, I'll have you out of here in no time. Please be seated. Oh Heavenly Father! We are gathered today to celebrate the banquet of life and witness the feast of love which Valentina and Anthony are to share in marriage. Let us begin by remembering that love must be a part of our lives and we have not loved enough. Amen! Tina! Tina! - Tina! Tina! - Open it! Get the door! This fucking mut! It's that jungle kid. Hey, hey, sit down! Welcome to God's house. Turn around. Turn around! Relax and make yourselves at home. Because this is your church and so in the presence of your church I ask you Tina and you Tony to state your intentions. Okay. Love grows. Love grows like flowers in the spring. Love grows it makes you wanna sing. Give it kindness, handle with care and before you know it you're in love. You're a pair. Love grows in twinkling stars and holding hands and in kissing in cars. Hey Nunz, Mets just scored. Sunlight. Sunlight. With the sunlight of friendship. - Go on. - Keep it going. Let her go. Our life, we bloom together as husband and wife. It's okay, grandma. What, did somebody die? Hey, it's the Vitales. Love merges the lesser with the greater. Love merges me with the universe. My quest in life is love. I and my father are one.

If anybody here knows of any reason why these two should not be joined together in holy matrimony, let them speak now or forever hold their peace. I... Fucker. I'll take that as a no. May God, the eternal father, keep you in love with each other so that peace of Christ may stay with you and be always in your home. Amen.

By the power invested in me by the state of New York, I now pronounce you husband and wife. You may now kiss your bride. Tony! Due to the unusually hot weather and the fact that our poor church cannot afford air conditioning, we will skip the mass. Skip the mass? Go my children and praise the lord.

Of course we never went on a honeymoon. Vito had a job, two jobs. Working for max sanitation outfit and moonlighting as a security man down at the Bowling Blarney. I mean, cause he wanted to buy his own truck. I mean, I thought he was crazy going into garbage, but he knew best. He always did. He never let me or the kids down ever. I know you miss him, Mrs. V. Good man is hard to find. Very rare. Seriously, I was watching you guys up there today. Mhm. And I couldn't help but thinking about myself, you know? My early married life was full of so much crap and turmoil. I know, I heard, I heard. Trying to get the Animal Kingdom off of the ground. You know, the place was nothing but a nickel peepshow when I took it over? And look at what you've done with the place. Aw, thank you, Tina. Yeah, but the thing about it was everything was a big decision. What do I do, what do I do, what do I do? - Do I go topless? - Mhm. Do I serve food? - I took the high road. - Mhm. You're not gonna have any of them problems. No. It's easy being a kid today, isn't it? Sure. Ah, you know, I really like talking to you. - Me too. - Yeah, you're very special. Thank you. Okay. Alright, thank you for the dance. Thank you. Tony! Listen, is there something, a special message that you want to tell Tina and Tony for their wedding? Yes. T and Tony, I hope that you guys spend together forever and ever. I mean, you guys are like the perfect couple. And I only hope that someday I find a boy who is perfect for me like Tony is for you, T. You guys are gonna be so happy together and you're both gorgeous and I love you. Muah. To getting through the day. So did you grow up with Tina's family with her mom and her... Well yeah, I mean, we're all from Queens, you know. And when she married Vito, that handsome bastard, they moved out to Long Island. She got all uptown. - You know what I mean? - Oh. - Like we were trash. - Yeah. Now what happened to Vito? Oh, Vito. I mean, you know, he was stringing lights in a fucking blizzard. Oh. And the thing went over, the ladder. You know? But she was a slave driver. She had him doing the lights in a fucking blizzard. But my theory is this, I feel Vito leapt to his doom because he was found, they say, with a smile on his face. Anything to get the fuck away from her. Alright, let's just put the music back on. She'll feel better. Hey, I think she's really hurt, dad. No, this is the old flash knockdown routine. I've seen it a million times, okay? Alright, let's just get her up. Tina. Look, all I'm saying is, T, if we make a big deal about it, she'll milk it, alright? I would. Listen, ma, look it. Enough, alright? Come on. Get up, get off the deck. Okay, sit down right there. Alright, everyone. Grandma's okay. So why don't we all settle down and find our seats. Let's go back to our seats and how about a hand for grandma. 80 or 90 something and still trucking. God bless. We didn't get to finish dancing. Why are you being so selfish? Me? She's the one being selfish. - Tina. - Ugh! I never seen her like this. Wait till you get her pregnant. She's gonna grab a hold of your balls. She's not gonna let go until you're in the grave. Oh, that's a nice, healthy way to look at marriage. What are you on, drugs? Yeah. Look, I'm just trying to be an honest best man with my best friend. Save it. You know, me and Tony, it's uh... It's been forever, you know? It's more than brothers, you know? You know, I... You know... You know, I love him, you know? - You do? - Yeah. I feel like you feel very close to him. No, I do, I just don't want nothing to change. You know, after this. And you know, Tina, she's great, she's the best. Tina. You know, it is definitely gonna change. I mean, he's going to move away and live with Tina. I'm assuming, right? I mean, that's gonna be difficult on you. Yeah, I know. I mean, that's what happens. You know, you get married things happen, things change, right? - Yeah. - I know. Barry, Barry, Barry, Barry, Barry, Barry, Barry! Uh... Tony. Tina. Uh, we've been friends a long time, you know? And we're tight. I, uh... thought a lot about what to say and I, uh... wrote some stuff down, but maybe it's better if I just speak directly from my heart. I never seen two people who more hot for each other than you two. Sorry, sister. Uh... You two are meant to be together. You love each other, you really... You love each other and uh... That's what the fucking world needs more of. That's it. Oh, he's a regular Einstein. Barry. That blew me away. Well... She hung in there with me for a few years and uh... and so she hangs in there with me for a few more. - Here's to my beautiful bride. - Salud. - Tina! - Tina! Oh, I wanna make a toast, too. I wanna make a toast. Sorry, honey. Okay. Paula Abdul, Forever your Girl, is my favorite video of all time. To Taylor Dane, Pat Benatar, this Long Island girl's proud! Yeah! Oh, and Madonna your sexy videos make my panties wet! - Cheers! - Cheers! To the two T's in my life... Hey, hey, hey, that's enough of that crap! Save some for later. Believe me, it don't get no better neither. Alright. Tony, you're my son and I love you. And Tina, you're a Nunzio. You're my daughter. I only hope that you can make him happy. As happy as the love of my life, Maddy, makes me. I allow her to create, she allows me to procreate. Know your place, suck some face. Such a beautiful thing, isn't it? Hey, everybody, listen! Save your wedding invitations. Take them all to Animal Kingdom later, I'll give you ten percent off any drink. - Yeah, yeah. - Alright, that was beautiful. Pops, the human cupid. Well we wanna make a toast, too. I would like to toast my beloved husband. Tina's father, Vito. Who's beautiful life was cut short a year and a half ago because he liked Christmas. He loved Christmas. And he wanted those friggin' lights up on the roof before the 15th. I mean, he should've never been up on the roof that day, but you know, he was never one to shirk from a job. Even if no one was there to help him. Hail, Vito! Hail, Vito! Come on, buddy, raise your glass. Hey! Oh, shy guy. It's alright, Dom. It's alright. I'll take care of it. - For Vito. - Calm down, it's alright. What are you doing, Michael? I told you you had to be good. - Vito. - You have to be good. Now behave yourself or I'm gonna throw you out. - I'm sorry, Mrs. V... - This is Tina's wedding. Behave yourself. Please, Father Mark. A blessing and a prayer. Hey, hey! Pope spelt my name wrong. Well that's what you get when you get a Polish pope. You know, on that note, let us pray. Oh heavenly Father! We ask that you bestow your many blessings upon Valentina and Anthony. In the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Amen! Amen. Amen. Thank you, Father Mark. Holy water from our holy fountain blessed by the Pope himself on his last visit in 1979. Father Mark, ladies and gentlemen. Just that you have a beautiful place here. Thank you very much. It was inspired by the movie Spartacus. You know, I saw that movie when I was a teenager. I was very impressed by it. My parents ran an Italian restaurant and you know, I used to eat there. And uh, I was always involved in food and eating and cracking jokes. You know, in high school I was... I remember Tony Pitzicarda once said to me... What are you comedian? And I was as a matter of fact. You know, they didn't slap me around because I kept them laughing all the time, see so that's uh... We merged the food, the comedy, and my natural inclination to entertain, you know. Came up with the Coliseum. Oh! I invented it basically. You invite Michael... Hi, girl! Well... Did you know that olives make you horny? Yeah. - Eat it. - Hey, come on. What are you doing? Hey! Catch the friggin' olive. Hey, watch the suit before I make you clean it. - Hey! Hey! - Oh! That was nasty. - Men are so gross. - Yeah, gross. Oh, you've had a hard on for Barry ever since you got pregnant. No, she's right, T. She gotta watch him all the time. Look at Johnny hitting on that queer bouton. Yeah, but Dom wouldn't do that you. He loves you. No, cause he knows I'd kill him. But I know he does it behind my back. They all do it. Always checking their options. Listen, girls, we're here to carry the bloodlines. Sex all the time, they're trying to blow you up. Then you got the baby, it's the Elvis thing. The what? Elvis. I read, once his wife had a baby, he stopped having sex with her. Some kinda weird mommy thing. Barry? No. Looks it's like I told Marina... I said, honey, get yourself a good vibrator, a good dog, and a good cleaning service. That is all a woman needs. - Amen. - Right. On my wedding day, you're telling me this? Y'all need to get your heads checked. No, you get your head checked. Why do you think I'm putting off Dom? Hello, he wants to blow me up. I ain't in no hurry to marry him. Alright, well thank you. Thank you. I'm gonna go commit some suicide. Oh, T. Mm! Hey, can I get a plate full of ziti? Hey, Tone. Tina okay? No, she's been acting weird. And this is just today, right? It's out of the blue. Yeah, it's freaking me a little bit. You ever hear the phrase, the apple don't fall far from the tree? What? - Oh no, gross me out. - Listen, Tone. I mean, I'm sorry to say, but why you think I've been holding off on Donna? You know, she's been bitching to me about getting married. Yeah? Listen, last Christmas I was at her place and I saw the way her mother just fucking beat on her dad. Got me to thinking. No, no, no. Tina hates her mother. Not my Tina. Well I fucking hope so, Tone. I do for your sake. No, not my Tina. Ma! - Ma, ma! - What is going on here? What? Ma, there's no prosciutto in my ziti. Ma, ma! There was in mine. It's not from the second tray. Oh my god, you're right. It's empty. I know, it's nasty. He's not getting away with this. Just get over here. - Oh ma, don't make a scene. - Eh, Joey! I mean, this is really where you gotta see a resemblance. I don't know. You know, when they're not together every day it'll wear off. It's bound to. Josephina and our bride. What the hell do you call this? - Ziti. - Right. We paid for prosciutto stuffed ziti and there's no prosciutto! Well there should be. You know, the help these days. You're taking advantage of me because I'm a widow. You know if daddy were here he'd punch you! I'll refund you $100. And then you'd wake up and he'd punch you again. $29.99 for boiled pasta? Okay, a hundred and a quarter. $150. You got it. I just want yous to be happy. Fine. Alright. Alright. You gonna do some more jokes for us later? Of course. Vinnie was always the funniest guy in school. My pleasure. Yeah. You know what? Check that. Make that stinger a lemon ball and put a vodka seven in a soda glass for me, alright? Hey, you got the game on back there? - This good? - It's good. Can't put the game on. Vinnie don't want it on during the wedding. Sorry. Hey, Mikey. Hey, Barry. How's the video business? It sucks. Hey, listen. You fuck with Tony, I break your face. Cool. Here you go, chief. Hey, Father. Hey, you gonna have a strong one? Oh, no, no. On duty till the end of time, you know? Hey, Bar.

I don't know, maybe you've heard of it. You know, some of the girls at the uh... Doing exhibitions at the Kingdom make upwards of forty, fifty dollars a night, you know? I mean, it's no Uncle Sam. Wow. You're kidding me? No, it's true. But uh, I mean... You know, it's um... It depends on the act, you know? You know, it's... If you wanna come in one night, maybe one afternoon, you know? Maybe I can help you put something sexy together, you know? Listen, asshole. I'm a singer in a hot band that had a top ten hit a few years ago. Why the fuck what I wanna dance butt naked in your shithole? Jerk. Nice said, Celeste. See ya, asshole. Come on, keep trying. Hey listen, Donny. Uh... How about playing some Madonna or the Boss, you know? I mean... Well, we don't play Madonna or the Boss. We don't do no covers, we just do our original material. Yeah, I understand that, but Tina and I talked about... No, no, I'm sorry, man. Hey, Zeppo. Zeppo, is this the big gig you were telling us about, huh? For two weeks? They don't even know who we are, Zeppo. Hey, man, they love you. - They love us? - Yes, absolutely! Maybe we're not in the same club here, Zeppo. They hate us. Look man, when we gonna get back in the studio? Studio? Studio's maybe a month, a week, maybe six months away. It's right around the corner. Alright, what is the dealbreaker? - Huh? - Truth? - Yeah. - Rap. Hey, Zeppo, honey. Can you do more than a little bit? I'll be right with you, sweetheart. - Thank you. - I love your hair. Oh, thank you! - Rap? - Rap. They're looking for a little rap. It's kind of a new wave deal. You know. We don't change our sound for nobody, alright? Fuck rap. Sorry, Father, but fuck rap. We are power ballads. Absolutely. Stay with it. Power ballads forever. One hit wonders. I still love these guys though. What do you need, boss? I didn't even know any of those songs. You got it. I want a girl like you, man. You're a happy guy. I'm saying hi to Tone here. That's perfect. Why don't you give a little message to Tony and Tina to my camera? That would be very nice for them, no? I don't know. Um... Uh, well I just, I hope, you know... I hope that you're gonna be happy, Tony. Um... I mean, you know what you're doing so I don't need to be talking about that, I just... You are very sweet. - That's very nice. - Um, yeah. Hey, you guys. Let's go get high. Let's go. Let's go, let's go, let's go. Johnny. Hey, Johnny. Do you wanna eat with me? Hey, come here. Buzz off, alright? I'm getting laid tonight. I'm getting laid tonight. You two should get together. Barry, get me a drink first. Baby. When we getting out of here? Not until I get really drunk, really sweaty, and really horny. You two should go visit each and every table and I mean right now. Here's your booster bag. Ma, we will visit when we want. I said now. Ma, I am married now, alright? I will visit when I want. Barry, Dom. Barry, Barry, Barry Have you seen that cute blonde out there I was talking to before? Yeah, yeah. The one you've been drooling over since church? I've seen her. Well, come on, it's not obvious, is it? Johhny, she's like... She's sitting at the kiddie table. - What is she 13, 14 years old? - Fucking fag. No. No! Man, it's just... Those tits, are you kidding? No, no way. Whatever, Johnny, you're the expert. You've seen that ass. Oh, right now! Smoking weed! Tony is beautiful. The baby's gonna be beautiful. And I gonna wish them they have a lot of baby and that I gonna be a grandma and they gonna talk Italian. Nobody talks Italian, no? They wanna be American. Eh, what are you gonna do? They go to school in America, they come over here and they talk Spanish. I don't understand. Nobody talk Italian. Tony no talk Italian, Anthony no talk Italian, Tina no talk Italian. ♪ All alone, I see you standing there ♪ ♪ With nothing left to show me but your tears ♪ ♪ Feeling sad, what can I do? ♪ Pour some shots, come on. Pour one for her, too. - I don't want one right now. - Just take one. Here's the thing... Like Frank, I'm getting into the autumn of my years. Dad, keep a lid on it. No, no, no, I am really. And I've been breaking my ass all my life to build a respectable strip joint from what was nothing but a... But a nickel fucking peep show. That's right. And building you boys a damn good home while I was at it. But the thing is, I think I've done enough. I wanna phase myself out of the club. So if you want it, you can have it. You gonna take that drink now, baby? Wait a minute. You're trying to be nice and give this as a wedding gift of the most important thing in your life. T, he wants me to run a fucking strip club. - Live stock and pasties. - Dad. That's the most generous thing you've ever done in your life. I mean, let Tina and I sleep on it. Oh, I'll fucking sleep on it. Fuck you. There's a few little strings attached, okay? You're gonna take care of your idiot brother, Johnny, for life. Put a roof over your grandma's head, and of course, there's my golden parachute, but these are minor gotsies we can work out later, alright? The important thing now is to let loose, have fun, it's your wedding because believe me, it's all downhill from here, huh? Huh? Come here. - Uh, excuse me. - Hey, hey, hey. Come here, Tina. Come on. Sit on daddy's lap. Come here. You know what? I don't think it's a very good idea right now. Why, what's the matter? You got a little gas? Hey, where you going? Come on! Keep your fucking father away from me for the rest of the night. Hey, he's my dad. Yeah, unfortunately. Listen, he's trying to do the right thing. That club's his life. His, T. His, not mine or yours. Do you not remember how you told me you hated it? I know, I know. Listen, nothing's changed. I can't wait for us to get out of here. You know, just by ourselves. Hey. What's with the long faces? This is supposed to be the happiest day of your lives. What was that? All I'm saying is nothing's ever gonna be the same again. That's good because things as they are kinda suck. So fucking stupid, Barry. Ugh. Marina. What are you guys doing? Fighting already. He's the cause of all this shit. I know it. I'm gonna kill him. Hey, just chill. Chill, bro, chill. You don't wanna spend your honeymoon in sing sing. Yeah, you'd be popping the wrong cherries. Check out the fucking slut. She's a fucking burden. Now listen, do you have a boyfriend, a special boy? I do, his name's Dominic. He's very hot, but he's really kinky and sometimes it's like a little too much for me. And I really like Donnie, the band singer. - Oh, he's cute, right? - He's gorgeous. Now do you think you're going to get married to Dom? I don't know. Maybe someday I will, but he wants to get me pregnant and I don't wanna get the stretch marks over here. Yeah. Cause I already have some on my ass and I don't really like it too much. - Yeah. - So I might, I might. Or maybe I'll adopt, like a kid from, you know... - Russia or something. - Amazing. I hear they have a lot of kids over there. Really? That's what I heard, that's what I was told. It might not be true though. His idea of a good wedding gift is the Animal Kingdom. Your mother would freak if you were running the strip joint, T. She'd fucking flip her lid. She wouldn't be able to handle it. - Hey, Tina, bathroom? - It's over there. It makes me wonder about, T, you know? Instead of backing me up, his wife, he's kissing up to the old man. Where's Tina? And where's Uncle Louie? He went, you know... By himself? I think I'm drunk. Say a prayer. Find him. Shit. Alright, that's enough, Donna. Listen to me, you one hit pussy. Stop! Ow! Fuck. Fuck! Sit down. - Sit down, Donna. - Fuck you. Sit down. Get the fuck out of here! Go! Get the fuck back! Listen to me, Donna. Everybody who fucking sees you running around that fucking faggot - Do you know what that makes me? - What? It fucking makes me an asshole, Donna. You know what, Dom? You are a fucking asshole. What the fuck you... Donna! Just fucking please stop. Please fucking stop dancing with him, okay? You're making me look fucking ridiculous. What? What? What's so fucking funny? Come here, baby. Come here. I love you, baby. Hey, go. Fucking go. Uncle Louie! Oh my god, he's peeing in the holy water! Uncle Louie! No more diaper for me. I'm a man. Oh my god. Wait till I tell everyone! Joey, what's wrong? It's Uncle Louie. He peed the fountain. Don't say a word or Vinnie won't return our deposit. How's everybody doing? Here's a blast from our past. Our first number one hit in Japan, I Believe In You. I'm cutting in. I'm cutting in. ♪ It's hard sometimes, not to be afraid ♪ Okay, Michael, you're drooling on me. Sorry. Sorry. I can't stop thinking of you like that, Tina. In that way. But we were only together once. I live with so much regret. Tina, I desire you all the time. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. Hey, Tony. Yeah, I know. She's dancing with that freak. She's just trying to make you jealous. Yeah, like that'll work. Okay, alright. - Alright, okay. - Sorry, sorry. - Okay, two shots please. - Uh oh. Come on, come on. Zip Dick, let's go. - Hey... - Come on, Zip. Don't be hanging around with that dick anymore. Don't talk to me like that, alright? You're not my fucking mother. There you go, sweetheart. Thank you. They're wonderful kids, but this language... It worries me. I mean, I never been married, but I have great respect for women. And I do not like... Will they hear this? I do not like to hear women swear. It bothers me terrible because you know a woman is a wonderful thing. And a man is a good thing, too. A man, I suppose, they swear... I mean, they would on the baseball field, they spit, they swear. I don't know. That's alright, but uh... Women are beautiful. They are madonnas. You know what I'm saying? Oh my god! - Joey, not on my dress! - Not on my dress! No, stop it. - Louie peed in the fountain. - Peed in the fountain. Uncle Louie peed in the fountain! Uncle Louie peed in the holy water. A toast to the Nunzios! Alright, I'll get you another one. You want another one? I'd like to propose a toast to the Vitales! Alright? Get me another drink. - To the Vitales! - To the Vitales! Oh, Connie! Connie, Connie, Connie! You should do the next toast cause you're the maid of honor. Yeah, Connie, come on. You're my maid of honor. Cut me a break, I'm tired. Connie, you're my maid of honor. I'm pregnant, Tina. Well not too fucking pregnant to be drinking. Listen, little girl. My mother drank, I drank. Your mother yaps, you yap. Like mother, like daughter. You're fired. Donna, you're my new maid of honor. Why can't I be the new maid of honor? You're it next wedding, I promise. Come on, get your glasses up. Come on. Shut the fuck up. She's giving a toast. Okay, get your glasses up. Shut up! Shh! Donna's making a toast. To Tina. You're a righteous girl and I've been you're oldest friend. I love you. I swear to god I would eat your vomit. - Aww! - Aww! Check please! That's a beautiful sentiment. That's a great fucking toast. You're having a baby. Two weeks. Two weeks. I know, I know she's gonna be a girl. I just, I know it. And I her name's gonna be Angela. Oh, I love that name. I have a pig named Angela. You do? But she's blind, and she has one leg, but that's okay. My baby's not gonna have one leg. My baby's gonna fine. My baby's gonna be healthy, and you know what? There is nothing, nothing proven about if you smoke or if you drink it's gonna do something to your kid. Alright, it's not gonna happen. I didn't say that. So he's as drunk as a skunk. How old was he, Nunzi? So anyway, I open up the bar to these three little pricks, right? Johhny, Dom, and Barry. They're all fucked up, hammered, demolished. But I finally get them to go the fuck home, and there's Tony sitting there all alone. - Remember this? - Yeah. So I go up to him and I go. Yoo-hoo! You want something who will have some fun with you, right? And standing there right before him, are three whores I got not wearing a fucking stitch. His face hits the floor. Right? So I figured I'd leave him alone. What would you do? Alright, you're 13, open bar, - three whores at your command. - Bang. I go away, I come back, this little prick he's passed out on the bull machine and his skivvies and the girls are playing Caribbean poker or some shit. Oh no! He never got it up, they say. So I say, oh yeah? Well you god damn bet his daddy will! Fucking with my joke? I guess it just came out. Ah, Nunz, the kid don't mean nothing by it. It's... You embarrass me in front of the shwim? I'm just a little tired of that story. You respect your father. So anyway. I take him upstairs and they earned their fucking money. Oh, there you go. Talk about earnest! Whoa, fuck that! What the fuck you doing? What's fucking wrong with you? Michael, Michael. Hey, you like to smoke weed, right? Alright, look. This is for you, okay? But it's really weak so I want you smoke the thing, okay? Oh, Barry, man. You're the coolest. You're so much smarter than these other guys, man. You know, I was always baffled how you keep a straight job, and you know, push pot at the same time. Just keep her at home so she never cheats on you. She never cheated on me. Not yet. Hey. A lifetime of teaching whores how to dance doesn't make you an expert on women. Not Tina anyway. Let me tell you something, kid, alright? Every bad quality a woman has gets bigger when they get married. Listen to your old man. Absolutely. Barry. Hey, Nunz, where you going? I thought you were getting rid of him. If this guy's as stupid as I think he is, he's gonna be comatose in about ten minutes and then we'll just pick him up and we'll lock him in his van. Listen, this place is scaring me, okay? We gotta wrap this thing up before all hell breaks loose. I mean it. Hey, you guys remember that time at the Animal Kingdom? When that guy lit himself on fire. Hey, hey, cut the shit. Cut the shit. I'm serious. That's what I'm talking about. - So... - Barry! - Holy moley. - Jesus. She's a nightmare since she got pregnant. I'm gonna give you one piece of wedding advice, Tony. Wear a rubber. Now how do you feel about being a father? - Oh shit. - You're going to have a baby. Tell me about it. Whatever, it's cool. You know, things gotta change. Look, Connie's a great girl. She's a great girl and uh, you know? We're gonna have a kid and uh... That's cool. Do you have any names picked out for them if it's a boy or a girl? I was thinking maybe like Jimmy. That's a nice name. That's my... I have a cousin named Jimmy. - Yeah? - Yes, we call him Jaime. He's a midget. He's very short. What the fuck you talking about? No, I'm just saying. I have somebody in my family that was named Jimmy. That's a very nice name. Now what if it's a girl? I came up with Jimmy. That's all I came up with. Father Mark, no one likes me. It's true. I mean, even Tina and Donna only kept me around cause I had a credit card or I had a car. They both owe me so much money. You know what though? Without them, I'd have nothing. No one. Will you dance with me? Please, it's the Tarantella. Come on! Please. Come on. I'll teach it to you. It's fun. Come on, please. Come on! Ma, ma! Sal! Sal, get in here and take pictures of my daughter. Right now. Nunzio. Nunzio. Get your kid in here to dance. Anthony, get in here. Come on. Are you happy now? Let's dance. - What happened to you? - What the fuck happened... Why are you here all of a sudden? What? Too busy at the fucking bar? Thank you, Donnie Dulce for that wonderful Tarantella. And now folks, let's all take our seats because the magnificent wedding cake is just around the corner. My gladiators and slave girls are happy to get you anything you need. Fellatio, grab bags, myopia. They're all here to serve you. Tina, you alright? Listen, what did the Nunzio's get you as a wedding gift? The Animal Kingdom. What? - Oh my god! - Hit him! Fucking freak! He's chimping, man. He's fucked. I'm gonna get him to his van. Tina! Let's not fight. Italians are lovers not fighters. Hey, do you know why the Italians lost the war? They used spaghetti instead of shells. Hey, where are my Jewish friends tonight? You heard the one about the Jewish kid who comes home, he says, "Ma, I just got part of the husband in the school play." She says, "you go back and tell them you want a speaking role!" Speaking of Jews, you know why they can't keep Jews in jail? They eat lox. Shut the fuck up. Thank you. God bless. I have a wonderful memory of Tina. I was saying a rosary once and I was using a particular rosary that's very rough. And my fingers were getting slightly bloody and Tina, she was about three at the time, came up and kissed every single one of my fingers so that it wouldn't bleed anymore. Isn't that beautiful? You guys had sex, didn't you? T, knock it off, alright? Why are you always defending him? What kind of hold does that freak have on you? What kind of hold does your daddy have on you? Where did that come from? Tina, I wanna see you now. Alone. Ma, I'm talking to Tony. I'm all set. Tina. I'm gonna teach you how to handle your man. Ma, chill out, alright? Do you think I really wanna run a nudie bar? I was just wanna go to the bathroom. Not yet. What? What do you mean, what? I wanna know what, what, what you feel about this whole club business? Why'd you tell her for? Oh, you were gonna keep it a secret? No, I just thought that since we were married maybe... Oh heaven forbid, we should delve into your life coven here with my daughter! Well T, I told her because she's my mother. Is this what I got to look forward to? What, cause now I'm a Nunzio I can't talk to my mother? I just wanna go to the bathroom. Look Tony, I know you understand. You really understand how we accept and work, you know? Accept these things of your father's business, but you know? I-I-I gotta tell you, had I known... and I know I speak for Uncle Louie, too. Had I known that this was gonna turn out like this, I never would've given my blessing to this marriage. Having you drag my Tina, my Tina down... Ma, shut up! Oh my god! I swallowed my gum. Filth! Swimming in filth! Aunt Josie! And Aunt Clare, Sister Clare! I just came in to do my afternoon prayers. Sin, sin, sin, sin, sin. - Father Mark! - Hey. What the fuck's going on? Thank you both so fucking much for ruining my wedding day. Maddy, you fucking deserve him. I'm sorry, Tina. What the! In front of the penguin, dad? Oh yeah, thanks a lot! Another wasted friggin' erection. What is the situation with you and Tony's father? What is going on there? You had to bring that up? Sorry. He's a difficult man, you know? Long time ago we had a... Ooh, you had relations with him. - No, no, god, no! - No? Did you ever kiss him? - No, well... - No? No, I never kissed him. I... Are you sure, Mrs. Vitale? - You seem a little... - I'm sure. No, no, no. I never kissed him. I mean, you know, it was a flirting thing in high school. I liked him, he liked me, but then Vito came. Vito, my Vito. Vito, I miss you so much. You should be here on our daughter's wedding day, but it's alright. Do you think he would be proud of her today? He would be so proud. My Tina's so gorgeous. Tina, I love you. You are so beautiful, my one and only daughter. Father Mark! I need to confess. Josie Vitale. Come on, Josie. Santa Lucia. Ladies and gentlemen, Josephina Vitale has the - voice of an angel. - Ma, ma! She's the soloist in her church choir. Let's have a warm round of applause... Oh, no, ma. Ma, no, no. I really don't want it. Tina, smile. Smile, this is the happiest day of your life. Come on. Ma, ma, ma! Come on! Have you seen those Menudo boys? I mean, my god, you know? Joey. Tony... The Vitales dedicate this to you. Welcome to the family, God bless. And now ladies and gentlemen, the Dolcetones of Josephina Vitale. Aww. Thank you, Vinnie. Thank you so much. My pleasure. Thank you, thank you so much. Oh God. Uh... You know, I wanna dedicate this song to my beautiful daughter, Tina. You know, my mother sang it to me at my wedding, her mother sang it to her at her wedding, her mother sang it to... Well, you get the idea. Thank you. Thank you. What'd you think of Tina's reception? Beautiful. It's all I have to say. Gorgeous. I know myself knowing I'm an image person and I work with a lot of design. Shape, color, tone, volume. I'm being... I'm studying to be a one-hour photo lab technician. So I understand magazines, glossy periodicals and I can see from the design of this that what she's made here is something to be remembered. And I know I will. And I hope she does. Sal, where are you? Come on. Get up here and take pictures. I'm paying you to take pictures. Now the rest of yous, you give a dollar, ten dollars, twenty dollars, in exchange for a dance with the bride and groom, alright? Okay, line up, line up. - Ma. - Oh, look! Uncle Louie gave $20 and grandma Nunzio a dollar. You're acting like an idiot. So what else is new? You're my wife now. Doesn't mean you fucking own me. What happened to you? Oh, fuck off. Tina. - Tina! - Daddy, I'm so sorry. Where are you when I need you? If I can get normal, if I can just get normal, everything would be okay. I've ruined my wedding day by the way I can see with all of our families. He knew it was gonna be a disaster. He wanted to elope. But everything always has to be my way. Daddy, I'm so sorry. I promise I'll never drink. I promise I'll never do drugs please. Tina, come on. T, I'm so sorry. Hey, Tina, cut the bull. Let's make up. Make up! I don't wanna make up. I have the rest of my life to make up. Everything's over, T. Our marriage, our wedding, everything. Joey, I have to go to the lady's room. Just keep an eye on things. Got it. Hey, hey, ho! Enough of that crap! Zeppo, cut the PA and the mic. You got it. Give me the mic. Let's have fun. Here you go. Alright. Are we ready for some real music, eh? Fucking A!

Hey, dad. - You gotta help me with Tina. - Hey, hey, you made your bed. - Lie in it, come on. - Dad, I'm serious. After what you did to me turning your back on me like you did? - Anthony. - Get out of here. Ant, get her down. Get her down. - Alright, Maddy. - Hey, hey, hey! What are you doing? Hey, I don't want this at my wedding! Oh, what are you embarrassed of your family now? What are you, a Vitale? - Get down from there! - Hey, hey, hey! Back off, boss, or I'll call the cops. Call the cops on me, you goddamn hoodlum. Oh, so you finally pussified my son, huh? You can't talk to me like that. - Oh really? - You live in the gutter. You're dragging my daughter down with you. Let's get something straight, baby, alright? You puke, you fought, and you fuck just like the rest of us and you grew up doing it three lousy blocks from my gutter in Queens! - Don't speak to me like that! - Oh yeah? Next time why don't you bring a big "Don't speak to me" sign and I'll pipe it up your ass! You goddamn son of a bitch! If Vito were here, he would rip that crap out of your heart! Tina! I dedicate this concert to you, babe. - Oh my god. - Oh my god! Barry! - Rock and roll! - You gotta be shittin' me! Tina! What the fuck is happening? I got him, I got him! Left to right in the outfield. Get away from the cake! Get the fuck down from there! Dom, shut up, shut up. Oh my god, that yellow's so unfortunate. You gotta relax. Don't do this. I know it's been a long day. I know how you feel about Tina. I feel the same way, but you gotta relax, okay? - What's he gonna do? - Alright? Take my hand, come on, come on. It's alright. Tina forever! That cake tastes like shit now! Clean him up. - My wedding is ruined! - Barry? Barry. For the last time, get him in his fucking van and bring back the keys. I wanna see the fucking keys, okay? Barry, get him the fuck out of here! Right now! He's got Tony and Tina on his ass. No friggin' way I'm touching that cake. Check, please! Dominic, go easy! Let's wrap this turkey up. Do the short version. You got it, Vinnie. Grab Max, get the cake, bring it out. Let's go, come on! Fuck off, Tony! You fucking dick! We gotta take control of this situation. - Alright. - Alright, after you. You're not Mrs. Nunzio. Ugh, not kidding. Mega fucking prick. Tina, come on. Mrs. Nunzio. You know, here have another one, Father. - Come on. - Nah. No, no, no, have some! It's good. There you go. - That's enough. Drink up. - It's good for you. So basically what we're talking about here is an annulment, alright? It ain't a divorce because they haven't had intercoursal entry yet as man and wife. Anyway, look, Jo. Mrs. Vitale, I'm sorry. I understand. We have to speak frankly. - Am I right? - I know. Look Father, you know as parents, we're obligated to expect the worst. That's right. It doesn't get any worse than this, believe me. No, it don't get no worse than this, man! You people have lost your goddamn minds! This whole wedding is going to hell and I ain't never been around crazier white people. - Hey, chill out, bro! - Sit down, relax! You're so tense, my god. Here, drink this and you'll feel better. - I don't want to drink. - Listen, Jo. Just a sip... Listen, I understand how this works. Okay, listen. Who can you reach out to? Let's go, come on. - Who can you call? - No, no. Desmond Tutu? The Pope? There must be somebody. Who's above you? Who's the guy behind the guy behind the guy? - Come on. - I don't want your money. Look at this. You can get something nice. A change of clothes. Something. Give it to the church, you know? Get a new swimming pool. A nice sauna maybe. Or you know... Something for the guys to enjoy together. Come on, take that. - The monsignor... - Expedited. Probably could find use for the money. All those little orphan kids, somebody. Somebody'll take it. I'll talk to the monsignor and see what can be worked out. - There must be something. - Bless us all. Here, take the rest. There you go. Alright, here we come. We're coming in. One. Two. Three. Come on, T. I ain't looking at him. I ain't looking at him. I don't fucking care. Put me down! - The fuck are you doing! - Knock it off. You're a Nunzio now! Come on. Throw the flowers. We're getting out of here. You throw the fucking flowers. Throw the goddamn flowers. I-I-I am a Catholic and I just can't make heads or tails of good and evil. You know, good and evil it's a con... We're all in constant conflict. And we're not in conflict if you'd just let it happen. I meant look, what I'm trying to say is... You know you have a devil and angel on your shoulder. They constantly are arguing, not bickering. Let me control this. Whoa. What I'm trying to say, Rafi. I can call you Rafi instead of Raphael. You gotta go with the flow sometimes. This is no more than a drink. You know? Um... I'm not ashamed. You should be ashamed of it, but let it go. Are you okay, Father Mark? I'm, I'm fine. Um... Sometimes it overtakes me and I don't know where I go. You know where you're going. That's why you should still be that way, but you decide that you wanna drink, but you don't need - a drink, but take it any... - Oh! What I'm trying to say is, um... that there's a good and evil in all of us. Let the evil take over. You're a little tramp. Well you should've thought of that before you married me. You know, if I thought about it, maybe I wouldn't have married you. You know what, T? It's not that fucking late. You don't need this and I don't need this. Yeah, yeah. He's got the... Yeah! Yeah! Donna! - Dominic! - Donna! - Get over here you! - Oh Dominic, I love you! Who's your man, hon? You are, baby, I love you so much. Okay. Okay. You saying you're leaving me now? Better now than after we have kids. Well that'll be a long time because first you gotta grow up. Oh, it'll be even longer than that because I ain't having kids in a fucking porno shop. Oh, it'll be perfect because mommy's such a tramp! Fuck you, T. ♪ You look at me and I can see the feelings gone ♪ ♪ What happened to the dream we planned our future on? ♪ ♪ You turn away, try to say what we both know ♪ ♪ Baby, I can't let you go ♪ ♪ Let you go away ♪ ♪ Cause I don't wanna lose your love ♪ ♪ I don't wanna be the one who's brokenhearted ♪ Oh! To Tony and Tina. Yes, actually, I would like to say that I give it five months tops and then I think they going to get divorced because I do not think that marriage is natural and I think that they should just have a lot of sex and maybe babies if they want, but I don't think that they are going to stay married. Oops, I'm sorry I said that. Is that bad, but that's the truth. That's how I feel. Sometimes these things are a blessing in disguise. Ma, was supposed to be the best day of my life. I know. - T. - T. Look, you want us to spend the night with you? I don't... maybe. We could all come over like we used to. No, no, no. Listen, listen, listen. You're gonna come home tonight. You're gonna get a good night sleep. And in the morning, I'm gonna lay out all your options for you. Okay, Tina? Come on, look at me. Tina! I got it all under control. What? I got it all under control. You do? Of course I do. Oh, you're so bad. Joey. Start the conga line dance. I can handle this. - What's your problem? - It's alright, baby. - Conga line, conga line. - What's the story, what? Listen, just for the record, I want you to know that you turned my daughter's wedding into a freakshow. - Hey. - Just like your... Your Animal Kingdom over there. Hey, don't break my chops. What do you think I'm a mameluke like Vito? Yeah, he'd still be alive if you didn't have him stringing Christmas lights in a blizzard. Oh, what are you talking about? When he leapt to his death, he had a big smile on his face. Oh, you liar. And you know something, baby. I'll tell you what. You can kiss my big ass. How's that? Get in the line. It's a Vitale tradition. Oh my god, you must be drunk. Get in the fucking line. Ladies and gentlemen. We seem to have a uh... minor problem in the kitchen. Now folks, will you help us out please? Folks, everyone's gonna have to leave the building and my gladiators will show you to the nearest exit. Good luck, god bless. Forget about it. Hey, hey, hey. I've been looking all over for you. I hear family's mix pretty well together, don't you think? Oh okay. Well listen, I was wondering... You wanna go out sometime? I don't think so. Why? Because you're a Nunzio, asshole. Check, please. You're asking for a check. Grandma, come on. Come on. Uncle Louie, this way. Come on. Do you need your diaper bag? - No, no, no. - Are you sure? - No. - Whoa, what's going on? Is Vinnie torching the place? You came back. Yeah, I had to. We're married. It says so on the car. Wait, T, do you still love me? Yeah, Tina, I still love you. They still love each other. Okay, come on. Let's go. Come on, let's get out of here. You, Tina and Tony, run as far away from your family as you can. Oh, si. Why you think grandpa, we come to United States? To get away from the crazy family. It's in the blood. Go have babies. Mix up the blood. Oh, she's right. You're my wife now. That's the only good thing that came out of this. I can't believe my father had me running away from my own wife. I can't believe my mother tried to divorce us before the reception was even over. Hey, want your ring back? Yeah. Come here. - Angelina! - Louie! - Tina! - Oh shit! Tina! - Ma! - Tina, come back! Ma, move on! It's over! Where you going? That's it, I'm leaving. I gotta move on, dad. What do I do with the club? Give it to Johnny if he wants it. He's a tomato or half-wit. Tina, you're acting rash! Rash? Ma, I've known T for ten years! That's not acting rash! - Listen to me! - Ma! - What? - This one's a nut. Her daughter's no better, alright? There's a serious kind of mental illness here that I recognize in you know who. I can just see you running down the street crying. Hey! Leave mom out of this. That's enough. Who brought you up, the flamethrower? Ma, get out of the car! But it's over! Me, you, the Animal Kingdom, everything. Tina, let's go. Tina, if you go, I wash my hands! Ma, I bet daddy did this to you on your wedding day. Tony, is not your father. Well, I'm not you either, ma, alright? You raised me to think this is the best day of my life, but I know better. The best is yet to come, baby! Baby? Baby? - Baby? - I love you, ma! Baby? She's gonna have a Nunzio baby! In your dreams! - Tony! - Tina, my baby! - Come back here! - Come back here! You don't know what you're doing! Oh, Tina, she's gonna have a Nunzio baby! Hey, Tony! We're attached at the hip, baby. Well I was thinking about somewhere else, but that's alright. - What the... - I'm getting married! - You're crazy. - Fuck it, I'm doing it! Dom, elope! Take my word for it. Elope! We did it, baby! Woo! We're free!
