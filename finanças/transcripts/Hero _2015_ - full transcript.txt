(WHISTLING) (LOUD THUDDING) (THUDDING CONTINUES) - (CROWD CHEERING) - (WHISTLING) MAN: Get up! Get up! (CROWD CLAMORING) (CROWD GROANS) (WHIRRING) (CROWD CHEERING) The winner, by total annihilation... Yama! Who is next? Who has the guts to step into the ring with Little Yama? CROWD: (CHANTING) Yama! - HIRO: Can I try? - Hmm. I have a robot. I built it myself. (CROWD CHUCKLING) (LAUGHING) Beat it, kid. House rules. You gotta pay to play. Oh, uh, is this enough? What's your name, little boy? Hiro. Hiro Hamada. Prepare your bot, Zero. (CRACKING) (IMITATES BONE CRACKING) Two bots enter, one bot leaves. Fighters ready? Fight! (CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) (LAUGHING) That was my first fight. I... Can I try again? No one likes a sore loser, little boy. (CHUCKLES) Go home. HIRO: I've got more money. REFEREE: Fighters ready? Fight! (CROWD SHOUTING INDISTINCTLY) Mega-bot, destroy. Huh? What? Huh? (CROWD GASPS) - No more Little Yama. - But, wha... This is not possible! Hey, I'm as surprised as you are. Beginner's luck. Do you want to go again, Yama? - No one hustles Yama! - Whoa. Hey... - Teach him a lesson. - (MEN GRUNTING) Hey, fellas. Let's talk about this. (ENGINE REVVING) (MEN GRUNTING) - Hiro! Get on! - Tadashi! Oh, good timing! (ENGINE REVS) A-ha! Oh, mama! (SCREAMING) - Are you okay? - Yeah. - Are you hurt? - No. Then what were you thinking, knucklehead? Ow! Ow! You graduated high school when you were 13, and this is what you're doing? YAMA: There they are! Hey! (PANTING) Hold on! Whoo-hoo! Yes! MAN: Get back here. Bot fighting is illegal. You're going to get yourself arrested. Bot fighting is not illegal. Betting on bot fighting, that's... that's illegal. But so lucrative! I'm on a roll, big brother! And there is no stopping me! (BRAKES SCREECHING) - (SIREN WAILING) - Oh, no. (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) BOTH: Hi, Aunt Cass. Are you guys okay? Tell me you're okay. - We're fine. - We're okay. (SIGHS) Oh, good. Then what were you two knuckleheads thinking? For 10 years, I have done the best I could to raise you. Have I been perfect? No. Do I know anything about children? No. Should I have picked up a book on parenting? Probably! Where was I going with this? I had a point. - Sorry. - We love you, Aunt Cass. Well, I love you, too! (BELL DINGS) I had to close up early because of you two felons. On beat poetry night. Stress eating. Because of you. - Come on, Mochi. - (MEOWS) This is really good! You better make this up to Aunt Cass before she eats everything in the cafe. (TYPING) For sure. And I hope you learned your lesson, bonehead. Absolutely. You're going bot fighting, aren't you? There's a fight across town. If I book, I can still make it. (GRUNTS) When are you gonna start doing something with that big brain of yours? What? Go to college like you? So people can tell me stuff I already know? Unbelievable. Oh, what would Mom and Dad say? I don't know. They're gone. They died when I was three, remember? Hey! - I'll take you. - Really? (SIGHS) I can't stop you from going, but I'm not going to let you go on your own. Sweet. HIRO: What are we doing at your nerd school? Bot-fight's that way! Gotta grab something. Is this gonna take long? Relax, you big baby. We'll be in and out. Anyway, you've never seen my lab. Oh, great, I get to see your nerd lab! - GO GO: Heads up! - Whoa! (INDISTINCT CONVERSATIONS) (WOMAN LAUGHS) Whoa. Electro-mag suspension? - GO GO: Hey! - (GASPS) - Who are you? - Uh, I'm... Go Go, this is my brother Hiro. (POPS) - Welcome to the nerd lab. - (CHUCKLES AWKWARDLY) Yeah. I've never seen electro-mag suspension on a bike before. Zero resistance, faster bike. (GRUNTS) But, not fast enough... yet. Oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Do not move. Behind the line, please. Hey, Wasabi. This is my brother Hiro. Hello, Hiro. Prepare to be amazed. Catch. Wow. - Laser-induced plasma? - Oh, yeah. With a little magnetic confinement for, uh, ultra-precision. Wow. How do you find anything in this mess? Oh! I have a system. There's a place for everything, and everything in its place. - Need this! - You can't do that! This is anarchy! Society has rules! Excuse me! Coming through! (GRUNTS) Tadashi! Oh, my gosh. You must be Hiro! (GASPS) I've heard so much about you! (KISSES) Perfect timing. Perfect timing. That's a whole lot of tungsten carbide. 400 pounds of it! Come here, come here, come here. You're going to love this. A dash of perchloric acid, a smidge of cobalt, a hint of hydrogen peroxide, super-heated to 500 Kelvin, and... Ta-da! It's pretty great, huh? It's so pink. Here's the best part. (GIGGLING) Whoa. I know, right? (LAUGHS) Chemical metal embrittlement. Not bad, Honey Lemon. "Honey Lemon"? "Go Go"? "Wasabi"? I spill wasabi on my shirt one time, people. One time! Fred is the one who comes up with the nicknames. Uh, who's Fred? - This guy, right here! - (SCREAMS) Ah-ah. Don't be alarmed. It is just a suit. This is not my real face and body. The name's Fred. School mascot by day, but by night... (GRUNTING) I am also a school mascot. So, what's your major? No, no, no, I'm not a student. But I am a major science enthusiast. I've been trying to get Honey to develop a formula, that can turn me into a fire-breathing lizard at will. But she says that's "not science." It's really not. Yeah, and I guess the shrink ray I asked Wasabi for isn't "science" either. - Is it? - Nope. Well, then, what about "invisible sandwich"? - TADASHI: Hiro. - Imagine eating a sandwich, but everybody just thinks you're crazy. Just stop. - FRED: Laser eyes? - HONEY LEMON: What? - FRED: Tingly fingers? - WASABI: Never gonna happen. FRED: Hey, what about a growth serum, huh? So, uh, what have you been working on? I'll show you. Duct tape? (SIGHS) I hate to break it to you, bro. Already been invented. Hey! (SCREAMS) Oh! Dude! - Ow! - (BEEPING) This is what I've been working on. (SQUEAKING) Hello. I am Baymax. Your personal healthcare companion. I was alerted to the need for medical attention when you said, "Ow." A robotic nurse. On a scale of 1 to 10, how would you rate your pain? Physical or emotional? I will scan you now. (BEEPING) Scan complete. You have a slight epidermal abrasion on your forearm. I suggest an anti-bacterial spray. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What's in the spray, specifically? The primary ingredient is bacitracin. (CLICKS TONGUE) That's a bummer. I'm actually allergic to that. You are not allergic to bacitracin. You do have a mild allergy to peanuts. Hmm. Not bad. You've done some serious coding on this thing, huh? Uh-huh. Programed him with over 10,000 medical procedures. This chip is what makes Baymax, Baymax. Vinyl? Yeah, going for a non-threatening, huggable kind of thing. Looks like a walking marshmallow. - No offense. - BAYMAX: I am a robot. I cannot be offended. - Hyperspectral cameras? - TADASHI: Yep. Huh. Hmm. - Titanium skeleton? - TADASHI: Carbon fiber. Right. Even lighter. (GASPS) Killer actuators. Where did you get those? Oh, machined them right here, in-house. - Really? - Yup. He can lift 1,000 pounds. Shut up. You have been a good boy. Have a lollipop. Nice. I cannot deactivate until you say you are satisfied with your care. Well then, I'm satisfied with my care. He's going to help a lot of people. Hey, what kind of battery does it use? Lithium ion. You know, supercapacitors would charge way faster. Huh. Burning the midnight oil, Mr. Hamada? TADASHI: Oh, hey, Professor. Actually, I was just finishing up. CALLAGHAN: You must be Hiro. Bot-fighter, right? When my daughter was younger, that's all she wanted to do. May I? Uh, sure. Hmm. Magnetic-bearing servos. Pretty sick, huh? Wanna see how I put 'em together? Hey, genius! He invented them. You're Robert Callaghan? (STAMMERING) Like, as in, the Callaghan-Catmull spline, and Callaghan's "Laws of Robotics?" That's right. Ever think about applying here? Your age wouldn't be an issue. Oh, I don't know. He's pretty serious about his career in bot-fighting. Well, kind of serious. I can see why. With your bot, winning must come easy. Yeah, I guess. Well, if you like things easy, then my program isn't for you. We push the boundaries of robotics here. My students go on to shape the future. Nice to meet you, Hiro. Good luck with the bot-fights. (ENGINE STARTS) We gotta hurry if you want to catch that bot-fight. I have to go here. (STAMMERING) If I don't go to this nerd school, I'm gonna lose my mind. How do I get in? Every year, the school has a student showcase. You come up with something that blows Callaghan away, you're in. But, it's gotta be great. Trust me. It will be. (INSPIRATIONAL MUSIC PLAYING) (WHIRRING) (MUSIC STOPS) HIRO: Nothing! No ideas! Useless, empty brain! Wow. Washed up at 14. So sad. I got nothing! I'm done. I'm never getting in. Hey, I'm not giving up on you. (SCREAMING) (GRUNTING) What are you doing? Shake things up. Use that big brain of yours to think your way out. - What? - Look for a new angle. (SIGHS) Huh. (SNORING) (CONTINUES SNORING) (IMITATING EXPLOSION) Wow, a lot of sweet tech here today. How are you feeling? You're talking to an ex-bot fighter. Takes a lot more than this to rattle me. - Yep, he's nervous. - Oh. Oh, you have nothing to fear, little fellow. - He's so tense. - No, I'm not. Relax, Hiro. Your tech is amazing. Tell him, Go Go. - Stop whining. Woman up. - I'm fine! What do you need, little man? Deodorant? Breath mint? Fresh pair of underpants? Underpants? You need serious help. Hey, I come prepared. I haven't done laundry in six months. One pair lasts me four days. I go front, I go back, I go inside-out. - Then I go front and back. - (GAGS) Wow. That is both disgusting and awesome. Don't encourage him. It's called "recycling." ANNOUNCER: Next presenter, Hiro Hamada. (CHUCKLING) Oh, yeah. This is it. I guess I'm up. Okay, photo, photo! Everybody say, "Hiro." - ALL: Hiro! - Yeah! We love you, Hiro. Good luck! - Don't mess it up. - Break a leg, little man. Science, yeah! All right, bro. This is it. Come on. Don't leave me hanging. What's going on? I really want to go here. Hey. You got this. (CLEARS THROAT) Uh... Hi. - My name is Hiro... - (MIC FEEDBACK) (CROWD GROANS) (STAMMERS) Sorry. My name is Hiro Hamada, and I've been working on something that I think is pretty cool. I hope you like it. (POWERS UP) This is a microbot. (WHIRRING) (MOUTHING) Breathe. (EXHALES) It doesn't look like much, but when it links up with the rest of its pals... (CROWD GASPS) MAN: Oh. Whoa! Things get a little more interesting. (CROWD EXCLAIMING) The microbots are controlled with this neural transmitter. CROWD: Whoa! I think what I want them to do... (CROWD EXCLAIMS) They do it. (GASPS) The applications for this tech are limitless. Construction. What used to take teams of people working by hand for months or years, can now be accomplished by one person. (CROWD EXCLAIMS) And that's just the beginning. How about transportation? Microbots can move anything anywhere, with ease. (CROWD EXCLAIMING) If you can think it, the microbots can do it. The only limit is your imagination. - Microbots! - (CROWD CHEERING) CASS: That's my nephew! - Yes! - Whoo-hoo! My family! I love my family! - TADASHI: Nailed it! - (LAUGHS) (GRUNTS) - HONEY LEMON: You did it! - GO GO: Not bad! FRED: Yeah! You just blew my mind, dude! They loved you. That was amazing! KREI: Yes. With some development, your tech could be revolutionary. (CHUCKLES) Alistair Krei! May I? Hmm. Extraordinary. I want your microbots at Krei Tech. Shut up. CALLAGHAN: Mr. Krei is right. Your microbots are an inspired piece of tech. You can continue to develop them, or you can sell them to a man who's only guided by his own self-interest. Robert, I know how you feel about me, but it shouldn't affect... CALLAGHAN: This is your decision, Hiro. But you should know Mr. Krei has cut corners and ignored sound science - to get where he is. - (SIGHS) KREI: That's just not true. I wouldn't trust Krei Tech with your microbots, - or anything else. - (INHALES) Hiro, I'm offering you more money than any 14-year-old could imagine. I appreciate the offer, Mr. Krei, but they're not for sale. I thought you were smarter than that. Robert. Mr. Krei. That's my brother's. Oh. That's right. I look forward to seeing you in class. (GASPS) (ALL CHEERING) - Unbelievable! - A-ha! WASABI: That's what I'm talking about. CASS: All right, geniuses, let's feed those hungry brains. Back to the café! - Dinner is on me! - Whoo! Yes! Nothing is better than free food! - Aunt Cass? - FRED: Unless it's moldy. We'll, uh... We'll catch up, okay? Sure. I'm so proud of you. (GRUNTING) Both of you. - BOTH: Thanks, Aunt Cass. - (CHUCKLES) HIRO: I know what you're going to say. (IMITATING) "I should be proud of myself," "because I'm finally using my gift "for something important." No, no. I was just gonna tell you your fly was down for the whole show. Ha-ha-hilarious. - What? - (ZIPS) Ah. (LAUGHING) (TADASHI SIGHS) Welcome to nerd school, nerd. (SIGHS) Hey, I, um... I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for you. So, you know, thanks for not giving up on me. - (ALARM BUZZING) - (PEOPLE SCREAMING) (PANTING) Are you okay? (COUGHS) Yeah. I'm okay. But Professor Callaghan is still in there. Tadashi, no! Callaghan's in there. Someone has to help. (PANTING) HIRO: Tadashi! Tadashi! (THUNDER RUMBLING) (INAUDIBLE) Here. Have some tea. (SIGHS) CASS: Hey, sweetie. Hey, Aunt Cass. Mrs. Matsuda's in the café. She's wearing something super inappropriate for a
