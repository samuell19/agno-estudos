My Big Fat Father ”Señor, ten piedad de nosotros” ”Señor, ten piedad de nosotros” ”Señor, ten piedad de nosotros” Darn, we’ll rehearse that mass together with the farmers. I’ll gather twenty farmers who can sing. - Will you join in, Osvald? - Oh yes, daddy. When I’m in good form, We’ll practice target shooting, the whole summer. You must train your left side, and bend down as nimbly as on your right side. That’s what marks a great goalkeeper. What marks a great person? - That he takes good care of his family. - Thanks. He has wet himself. Why do you say that as if it was I? No! It was worn out anyway. Would you run the last bit, mother? Yes. Tell me once more how Bertil came to the farm. A war was raging in the world, but not here, and a man is a man, they said. And a woman is a woman, so he crawled in under a train and fled. When he no longer could hold on, he loosened his grip. When he opened his oil-stained eyes, he read “Hölö” on a building, and he stepped off. - And asked for a glass of lingonberry syrup. - Yes. Hi, Bertil. - Are you thirsty? - I guess mother is, yes. Do you call her “mother”? What is your name? - Viktoria E Larsson. - Right. You haven’t grown an inch since last summer. You were expected several days ago. Well, things changed. I see. Where’s my sister? She’s shaving her legs. She will sing Tosca this evening. And have to shave her legs? She says the hair on her legs get stuck in the stockings when she does the splits. Tosca doesn't do the splits, does she? In this version she seems to, yes. Let's do some washing, nosy-boy? Yes, and then you must see a peach tree I've grown. Hey, where did he go? He was here but a second ago. Yes, but a second ago. - Most athletics implies being at another spot than you were the moment before. - Let him run. - Of course. It amazes me how he can get down there... in seconds! - Amazement is also a part of athletics. - I'll take a shower. How is it possible to run that fast? - He’s taking after his mother. - After every devil! Come here, Osvald. Here is a small peach tree. - Yes, hello there. - Oh yes. Is that all there is? - I don’t look upon it that way. - Well, how do you look upon it? Well, it’s ... it’s a part of ... it’s ... - There’s a certain idea behind it. - I see. Can you get three olives on it as well? Osvald, come and look! Bertil is on his way of getting himself a savannah. Where have you been, sonny? In the seventh heaven, right? Come and have a look. A freaking bloody peach tree! It doesn’t matter how many they are, he says, as long as there are at all. - What is it? A peach? - No. You're nuts. The clover is this high in every field, unbeaten! It is soon Midsummer, and he’s talking about this peach. This won't do. - I’ll go and beat the meadow. - We must go to town. I haven’t had the guts to ask you, but ... Will you move into my house afterwards? By fall. Yes. Aren’t those your cows? What are they doing here? They are not mine. They look exactly like yours. Where are they going? - Home. - I see. Drive! Easy now, steady. There, there ... I dare not. ”Dare not.” what talk is that; ”Dare not”. I am here. - How do you do, Edvin Algot Friberg. How do you do, Tjaffo. - Vacation? - Hell, yes. Do you have a rope? - I have to be fit, for my boy’s sake. - You look fit enough. - No, I feel drained. Too much booze. I see. Well then, have a Tulo ... It relieves. Junior can drive, and I’ll run behind him. - Not on the road; not in your condition. - But he's with me, for Christ! Osvald, release the clutch pedal. Osvald, give it half gas, smoothly! Cooows! Cooows! Are you really singing? No, I’m calling the cows. - You have a good windpipe! - Really? A damn good windpipe! How about joining a choir? - I don’t have the time. - Give me that cry again, will you. - Cooows! - Damn good windpipe. This Sunday, 7 pm at church; an Argentinean mass. I’ll play it on the gramophone. Bring the Mrs! - Was the running in ski-boots? - Yes, reeking of garlic, as fumes from hell. - Do you see the birthmark? - Yes. It’s a memory. I was born an orang-utan. For forty years I’ve been working on becoming a human. This is what is left of the orang-utan, a memory. You can comb it and rake it and sow Pot Marigolds on it. Forgive me, Osvald. One of these days I too will become a human being. You are one. Thanks. Osvald, "Bossvald", come! - Don’t you have any other shoes? - No. You’d do better with football shoes. - Do you think so? - Yes, straighter kicks. Hello, Osvald. - Want a cigar, Lippy? - Maybe later. - Do you smoke? - Well, a whiff or two per day. You start singing from here. ”Señor, ten piedad de nosotros” Well, I’m not fit for it today. Thank you. Here you have the lower part. Here you answer.”... Señor ...” I’ll provide you with the lyrics. ” ... de nosotros”. And here ... with a bloody gusto! Erik! Well my friends, what do you say? - Can we really do this? - Hell, yes! It’s not an easy piece. It’s a difficult tempo. Argentinean, isn’t that a bit odd? Here in the middle of ... It doesn’t rock! It’s a revolution. - Where do we perform it? - In this church, in fall, on Osvald’s birthday and Bertil’s marriage. There's plenty of time. - Can we listen to it once more? - Of course. - What are you doing? - Hush ... - What’s the matter? - Sadness. - And how is he? - He? He’s mad. Mad! - Nice of you to turn up. - Well, yes. - Nice of you to turn up. - I have no rhythm at all. But in a way, I’m an emotional person. - I like how you walk; lithe like a panther. - You cuckoo. Bloody shitty moped! Dad gave it to me. Nothing but shit! I’ll push you. What the hell is that smell? Come, Osvald, let’s go outside. Come! Look. Do you see the red house up there? That’s it, sonny. Perfect. A take off to such a place will be a matter of minutes ... period! If I'll have to walk on my knees, that house will be ours one day. - There is a pond. Do you see it? - No. - Up you go. - No. - Yes, up you go. - Do you see it? - Yes. - Is it uninhabited? - No, but it will be ... one day. I’ll speak with the count who owns is. But this is between you and me! - Lellen! Lellen, what’s the size of your shoes? - 44! Fine, stay at home, will you. Now we’ll buy Lippy some damn fine shoes. - Do you know the count? - Of course I do. Couldn’t you ask him? About the place ... I will, some day. I’ll have to wait for the right moment. Well, you know, you have to live with someone, who can ease you down a bit. Do you have a little something going on? What do you mean “going on”? A little chick? Someone to keep warm ... No. Do you want some advice? If you bump into some chick, Never lounge over a Dry Martini before she turns up. If you must go to the privy, shake it thoroughly afterwards. Always tell her that she’s had a haircut. Say that even if she hasn’t had one. Tell her that you worship solitude, together with someone, that is. Comment her teeth ... Busy yourself with something when she arrives, and never tell her, that you’re attached to your mother. Claim that you exercise regularly, that you love long walks, that you read ... Tolstoy ... “Toolstoy ...” It sounds like the name for a horse. If we buy a horse when we've got our place, we’ll name him Toolstoy. Do you want a bowl of French fries? - How many do you get? - As many as you like. - Fruit salad? -Yes. - A bowl of peas? - Yes. Don’t tell mother that I’m hanging around a bit with this chick. No, I won’t. “Suns are rising in the sky, so I can see you,” “if we never meet again ...” - You are very nice to your boy. - Boys will be boys ... - Do you like the rhythm? - Yes, wonderful, captivating ... - Better than Vivaldi? - Yes, better than Vivaldi. Shall we get a room and do some humping, just dry humping? Can you hump as in "The 'A' Train"? I’ll only call off a little something. Stay put and grow! - Two coffee and a big vodka. - Yes, sir. - At once, please. Re-establishing the balance, you see ... - Can I have a second bowl, please? - Yes. I'm not capable. You drive him home. What a fine daddy you have. He’s so very, very tired, that’s all. Please Osvald, I don’t fell that good either, wouldn’t you drum while I’m driving? Do "The 'A' train" ... - He stayed over-night, you say? - He was so very tired. - Do you want a fag? - Eh? - How will you get home? - I’ll walk. He really loves you and your boy. - I want to come along. - No, you stay. You won’t find him. You don’t know where he is. Leave him alone! You’re a destroyer. You cackle and tackle and destroy! You damn pheasant! How did he get home? Your sweet little chick brought him in the car. She showered you with praise. “He really loves you and your boy.” You love mankind so much, that you have to stay at hotels. Stop it! Let’s go down to the restaurant and have a snack, and start all over. How many times have we done that? This is the last time! Definitely the last. Did you sleep with her? No, I couldn’t. I was thinking of you. I see, you must go all the way to town to think of me. - It just happens that a person turns up, when you least expect it. - Indeed! You have no problems crying. This is the truth. Well, I don’t know. I must put an awkward question to you. Did you marry me for the reason of wearing tails? Well then, I’ll give you an honest answer. - Yes I did. - Good. - What’s the score? - IFK is losing. But you’ll make the last score, won’t you? I’ll make the last two ones when mother’s gone into the house. - I’m sorry. - Never mind. - Let me see one last attack? - When she has gone in. - Go into the house, sweetheart. - Can’t I watch your last attack, honey? There is a big sign outside the football field; a huge sign. Didn’t you see it? No. What did it say? “Osvald Nilsson’s mother is not allowed on the sports field.” - Aren’t you going to watch, daddy? - In just a little while, Osvald. How long is a while? Daddy. Daddy! Now IFK will loose! Damn, they lost! ”Señor, ten piedad de nosotros” - ”Señor, ten pieda...” - No. No! - Bring me the timpani sticks and you listen! ”You came to my wedding.” ”You came to ...” - Silence please, Sundén. - Shouldn't we be dressed uniformly? - Choir dresses, cassocks and sandals? - Just stick to your kettledrum stroke, Sundén. - Osvald, which stroke is mine? - Yes, and mine. Cooows! That’s it for today. I could go on the whole day. I did a little mistake, didn’t I? An old habit I’m afraid. - Why is it always someone else? - Stop it! You don’t see what I’m doing. My little Tjaffo-boy, I’ve seen everything for 15 years. Don’t “little boy” me! Come my little boy; go walking with me. Don’t “little boy” me. What’s the matter, dear sister? He never wanted me. Yes he did. Let’s go home, slowly, all the way to the gate of Heaven with bended knees. Why? Of gratitude for this place. With bended knees? Buffoon! -Oh. - No like this ... - Hello. - Hi. - Do you see? - Bloody hell, that's too much! That wasn't too bad, was it? Come! Let’s sit down. A matter of great importance in our family, a milestone ... is to sit down. - Couldn’t we target shoot instead? - No, sit down. - How about you? - No, you sit. I dare not. Sit down! Great! I must rinse my mouth. I’ve got blisters you know. They never seem to heal. Come, sonny, I’ll show you Paradise. Every time you feel anxiety, you should rest with a horse. A horse is like a woman. You always have to gently strike a woman before getting close to her. Unfortunately, they also want to know why you have come, but not so a horse. - Now we will rest, you and I. - No, please ... - It’s safe. Come now. - No ... - Why are you crying? - It’s nothing. Come. This is Paradise, the whole life in a nutshell. Lay down, sonny. It’s safe. She’s seen you already. I will shoot on you tomorrow. Lay still ... feel the peace in your body. Paradise, isn’t it? Daddy! Daddy, wait! You’d shoot on me. You promised! - Do you know what the ambassador said to the sad consul? - No. You must "console" yourself. What the hell do you know about that? You, with one sole chorale in your head, and one woman. One sole woman! If you go on like this, you will never get peace, not even after death. Even in Paradise there’s a draught! I don’t give a damn! Come here, man. I was just going to buy some cigarettes for the chick. She’s waiting. I can give her some. Did you bring cigarettes? Have a whiff you too, sonny. - Do you have yet another fag? - Hell, yes. - Now it’s urgent for me to die. - Yes. Why the hell do you say that? You said it, not I, you humping dumpling! Stop it! Stop what, Tjaffo? Stop teaching him socialize with chicks? Stop promising him a house at the other side of the woods? What shall I stop doing, Tjaffo? It’s broiling hot today. Yes. I daresay, there will be no singing in the choir with that one. He was almost in the nude. - The toilette, please ... - Over there. - The arm, man. - Amen ... - The arm! Oh, yes. So, you haven’t had the ... No. The Body of Christ. The Blood of ... of Christ ... - Take care of mom now, sonny. - Yes. I’m going away for a while, to a house with a magic pine-tree forest that can cure blisters in the mouth. And you take double bloody care! - What’s about our place? - We’ll cure that with some iodine. Forgive me. That day will come, and that day we’ll shut the whole world out; put up limits. A woodshed full of tools, a crate of Loranga soda for you. Then we’ll borrow a horse and build a wall. - When you return, I’ll do 210 with one foot. - 230! - So long, sonny! - Bye. Drive. For God’s sake, drive! Come, my little boy, come. Now there’s only you and me left. Shut up! No, let’s walk. I need to think. My old man says that Plantain is as good as a plaster. It might do some good to blisters too. You cannot have Plantain in your mouth all the time. At nights. Yes maybe. Cut me a little. Works perfect as a plaster. - You must be Birgitta, right? - Yes. - Hello. Are you the one who wets your bed? - Yes. Perfect. A guy I loved once pissed in my purse. I need someone until fall, when she’ll move here; to help me in the barn and in the house. - What? - Yes! May I smoke? Go ahead. - Osvald. - No. It’ll do him good to see his boy again. May I feel them? Yes, there they are! - Are you on the top, honey? - I am on the top. You don’t feel a draught, do you? Mother, it’s summer. Yes, Osvald, it’s summer. I’m almost forgetting about that. Don’t whimper for God’s sake. "Osvald, Bossvald, just a glass of soda pop." "Osvald loves to be on the top." - Here, daddy. - What is it? Plantain, a herb. Lippy says it can cure blisters in the mouth. Splendid, exactly what I need. Get some exercise, Osvald. - The same running style as you have. - Yes. How are you doing? - He doesn’t like me. - Yes, he does. For how long will you remain here? I don’t know. I’ll be home for Osvald’s birthday, and the wedding, fit as a fiddle. Hello, sweetheart. - Oh no. She’s very caring, that’s all. I don’t know if I can take it any more. Life your life. I'm sorry. You never wanted me, but I don’t suffer from that. - I suffer from the fact that you suffer. - Don’t think that much! I love to think. Osvald! One flight of stairs, number nine on the door. You’ll find my snuff there. Get it for me, will you? - How much does he know? - Not that much, only that you’re taking a good rest. He loves you. - Don’t leave me. - Don’t deceive me. . ”Dear Birgitta.” ”It should have been two ‘t’. Sorry.”. ”There’s no room for more on the paper, I think.”. ”I will come, but mother doesn’t feel that good.” ”Love, Osvald”. One “Lektyr”. Keep the change. - Why did he have accompany me? - But that’s just fine. He was going there anyhow. - I can manage on my own. - Sure. I will soon follow. - I must take a good rest first. - Why? You aren’t ill. - When will daddy be home? - At your birthday. If you get a new daddy, I’ll move to my fox burrow in the hills. Yes you will. Oh, my puppy ... Your beak is running. Take my hankie. - Thanks, I have some clean ones in my purse. - Well then. Bloody hell, you travel with lots of plastic! Satan, what an amount of plastic! Are you going to insulate a house? - He wets ... - In your hand – a hand-maid. At your foot – a foot-man. At your hip – a hippo. And in your arm ... some Armagnac. Yes, that’s the way it is. Let’s go aboard. I bring twelve pancakes with fried bacon. We will eat. Don’t you worry. Bye, puppy. Come on, Puppy Plastic. Good afternoon. Bye, Osvald. Take a nap if you feel too alert. - What are you reading? - “Death of a Salesman”. Erik Cederlund played it in the forties. He’s dead now ... Alcohol ... Konrad Gustavsson played it in the fifties. He’s dead too ... Alcohol ... And now ... I will ... play it. On this lake a layman photographer was out rowing, and he said: “In that very moment, when I had Djurökvarn in the objective,," a gull pooped on it.” - Hey, are you on the top? - Yes. Once you have had a lay, boy, you’ll get rid of the plastic. “He told me to come to his office. Rodger’s ...” Well, Osvald, would you care to read with me a little? What do you mean? You only read the other lines. I’ll do Willy Loman. OK, you begin. “He told me to come to his office. Rodger’s ...” A "lady garden" has no thorns no hatch, still you often get a scratch. - It doesn’t say so. - No, no, I know. I got to have a little nap. - Take off your daddy’s shoes. - He’s not my daddy. That’s what Jesus said too. Take them off. "When I was 17" "I walked into the jungle," "and when I was 21 I walked out." "And by God I was rich." - Pardon? - “Death of a Salesman”. Oh my gosh! I have travelled under the train all the way from Nyköping. I am ... The plastic. I got to have the plastic! When you are in my hands you don't. Is he asleep? I’m going to town. She’s singing this evening. You don’t have to make supper. Take this. Thanks, I’ll eat it in the car. Well now ... You wretched little dormouse. Weren’t you supposed to wake me up at Hölö? When I studied to become an actor, I once had a lecture in eloquence by a famous actress. Her name was Emilia Carlén Flygare. My line was: “Me, going to Södertälje?" "Never!” But there’s where I got anyhow, you wretched little dormouse. Now you listen. Never do that again! - Isn’t anybody here at all? - No I cannot stand it any longer if this fails. Playing with people like this is just horrible. They must realize that we take this seriously. Nobody is thinking that you’re playing with people. Tjaffo started all this ... not you. - They won’t comprehend a bit of this anyhow. - Shut up, will you. I was completely free! That’ll be a penalty kick! I didn’t mean to. You bloody idiot! Your old man has no blisters in his mouth. He’s boozing! - He does have blisters! He’s bloody boozing his head off. Have you been out driving? Yes. Good thinking, Osvald. You must ease your longing. Soon she’ll be here by me. Yes. Give me a hand, will you. After that, it’s milking time. Good Lord, my beloved little nosy-boy, have you grown! Do you understand how much I’ve missed you? Lord, how big you are! It almost frightens me. My tiny beloved little nosy-kid, come and hold your arms around me. I’ll despair if you do not hold me! I thought I’d break apart before I could see you. Here I am. Yes, and I am here. Come. Please forgive me. Good Lord, what did I do wrong? - Nothing. Do take a rest, sonny. Shit, an elephant! Who am I, Osvald? Fritz Algot Nilsson. I’ve been drinking. I cannot deny it. I have escaped. I simply evaded, as simple as that. - You must never see a child in this condition. - I’m not a child. No, but until the day, I’ve become a grown up, you have to be. And don't tell anybody that I’m here. Can I tell Birgitta? - Not a bloody bastard. - She’s not a bloody bastard. Not a whisper. Put this on. - May I have this dance please? - No. Hush, no talking. Please, forgive me, Osvald. - Come. - I’m fine here. What’s the matter? Nothing. Where does the string lead? Yes. Do you mean that I know? I don’t. Yes you do. To your daddy? I mustn’t tell a bloody bastard. I’m not a bloody bastard. To your daddy. No. Come. He must have turned over in his sleep. Get some sleep, Osvald. When will you leave? After the wedding. Go to sleep. Daddy ... - Hello, sonny. - Hello. - Did anybody see you? - Don’t worry; I slipped away. Let’s slip away to the hotel. Everything is on me. - I’ll only call off a little something. - No, we stay here. - Have you had a look at it? - Yes. - Is it still there? - Yes. Fine. Imagine, Osvald, we go to our place. We can fart in beat with Calle Schewen’s waltz ... and I don’t have to shave. I’ve worked it all out ... in here. - Can we go with you, Hogga? - Sure, hop in. No, I stay. Great, Osvald. When I return I’m free, the choice is mine. I’ll go straight in and choose mom. Bye. - Hello. - Hello. - Is that you, Osvald? - Yes. I’m leaving this place. - Where to? - Home. The fear won’t leave me. I might sound silly, but you have to be strong. Daddy is in town. I know. If only he would return sober, and at the appointed time. You must receive him as he is. Listen to me, Osvald. We have a daddy who is not exactly like other daddies. The others are not like him! Osvald! Well then, I’ll show you. Come on! - Come on, puppy, come on. Faster! - Damn! Look. Look! Look! Look! - Oh please, hold me, Osvald. - You old pheasant. Osvald... Your father has returned. Did he bring a gift? Damn, it’s my birthday tomorrow. Damn! I just wanted you to know. What time is it? Five. At eight o’clock I’ll be twelve years old. Damn. Is he pissed off? He is not pissed off. He is sad. What does he want? - What you have promised him. - Yes, I know. At least be honest with him. - I didn’t bring anything. - Well then, bring that! Comical, isn’t it, to come home to a boy’s eleventh birthday ... -Twelfth! - Well yes. And smile and say “Happy birthday, but I didn’t bring you anything”. At least that would be honest. Ride him, for God’s sake, wake him up, and make him get rid of the pimples on his back. - Good night. - Good morning! Good morning. - Is the whole house asleep? - Yes. One of the disciples had a childish delight for whipped cream. - Who? - I. - Can I have a dollop? - Be my guest. Thanks. Good morning. Mr Birthday I presume? - No. - Oh yes you are ... - Happy birthday, Osvald. - Tank you. - Did he bring anything? - No. - Damn! - Cream ... - Oh, thanks. I only found this one jacket. I used it when I was a chauffeur. Will it do? Good. It’s nice. - The trousers ... I don’t know if ... - We’ll have a look later. - Where are you going, Osvald? - Home. - But we must rehearse. What? "What...?" We must decide what to do instead. We have no choir. Your daddy doesn’t seem to turn up. Do I have to decide everything? Explain everything? Well, yes I have to. Come, the barn will have to do for the rehearsal. - It’s broiling hot today. - Yes. Let's begin? What shall we sing? - What do you say, Reverend? - Well ... the lad, will he go ahead of you, or behind you, or by your side, or ... maybe with his mother, or by himself. Who is the brain behind all this? We’d better do as is written; more or less I mean. Excuse me, one simple quest... To make it simple, just you marry, and we'll sing “En Dejlig Rosa”. We know that one. - My sole wish is to sing, to sing with junior! - Yes. - Mr Ander, who will you walk with? - Mother. - Your mother? - Osvald’s mother. I see. Well yes ... Well ... Come, Osvald. - Will he walk without the music? - Who? - Bertil! It would look odd if we walk to “La Traviata”, and the music stops half way to the altar ... I don’t know! Bloody birthday! Why can’t we walk like ordinary people? Pick yourself up, will you! “He told me to come to his office." "Rodger’s son ... Benjamin ..." "19 years old!” “I’ve been sacked.” “What is this talk, Willy?” “Mother, I have been sacked.” - “Come, get some sleep.” - Stop it! Strange, Osvald. When you have lost all hope, then you know them all ... the lines. Yes. - Hello. - Hello. I had in mind to give you a little something, before all the fuss begins. Thank you! Happy birthday, my beloved Sigge Eriksson. - Care to watch me skate like Sigge? - Yes. Did you see it? I let go my hand in the last curve! Come! Birgitta, you know that Tjaffo ... Oh, my love, my little birthday boy, what a mess! - Here are some clothes and shaving stuff for daddy. - What? There, there. Slip off and give it to him. Wise of you to wear a cap. A nice step! So. He was told to come straight here. Yes. Yes. “Times are coming, times are gone ...” for some people. This won't do. Let's begin. - Yes, we better do. He won’t be here anyway. - He will! Yes, sure. ... and this testified before God and before this congregation, I hereby establish your matrimony. Amen. Take is easy, mother. - Look at me. - I’m ashamed of my face. Take is easy, mother. He will make it. You shouldn’t believe that, Osvald. - I don’t believe it. I know it. Look at me! - I said I’m ashamed of my face. Look at me! In this very moment daddy is on his way to see the count. He steps off the tractor, combs his hair and says: “Now the right moment has come. Bloody hell, yes!” He arrives to a big, imposing door opens it, and there is the count. Daddy clears his throat: “Forgive me if I’m disturbing you, but today is Osvald's twelfth birthday.” “The Mrs is edgy," “and I will die from drinking, can I not find place to hide.” “You’re thinking of the house on the other side of the woods?” “Yes, I want to give that to Osvald.” “It is yours”, says the count. “It is yours.” Well, Mrs Nilsson ... Now it’s you and me, eh ...? Yes. Who ever you’ll go to bed with, it is always you and me. At spring, I’ll speak with the count, about extending the garden. Then we ask Lippy to make two deep holes for a football goal, and we’ll practice target shooting the whole summer. Then we will start ploughing with Tolstoy ... Toolstoy ... A potato field just under the hill. And then a stone wall from old Äppelviken. And do you know? I will apply you for the community course ... in paper craft. You can show off with that at school. English subtitles by Aliquis, translated from the sound track. A Swedish subtitle for the hearing impaired, made by Marianne Marty, was a good guidance.
