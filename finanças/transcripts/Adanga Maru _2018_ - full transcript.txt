Greetings,brother. -come... It's 12:01. You are late by a minute. -I can't open as you wish. Move away. -The government trusts you. Why this delay? We've been waiting since dawn. Hey, move away. Move. I can open only, if I go inside. Don't open the bar... Don't shut the public... Don't open the bar... Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... What about them? Don't care them. You go ahead. You wait. Don't shut the public... Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... You wait. Paraman boss has come. Don't shut the public... You leave. -He's the bar owner. Don't shut the public... Will you close the shop and the bar immediately? Or you want us to immolate? Take it. Take... Immolate yourself and die. You can't do anything, no matter how many of you immolate. Go and concentrate on your studies. Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... Boss, the count of college students is increasing. They'll be submissive only if we hit them. Shall I call our clan? Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... Hey, our guys work for us only for money. Police also works for us for money. If we thrash, it's unlawful. If they thrash, It's law and order. Leave it. Let's see. Tell me, Paraman... What sir, again these college students? Wait... I will look at that. Today is Sunday. The inauspicious time is between 4.30 to 6pm. But the phone rings in the morning itself. No... K4 police station. Ramdass... -sir, The college students are creating ruckus at Paraman's wine shop. Check and convey the status to me immediately. Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... Greetings, Paraman... Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... What is this? -tell... A mob. -tell... Wait, I will talk to them. 500 metres away is a must. Listen, dear college students. -are you following the law? 500 metres away is a must. Wait for a second. Are you following the law? Wait, just for a second. Be calm. Dear students, Sir, ask the Inspector to come. We both are in the same attire. Ask the person to come who has stars in his attire. What? Sir, the situation is getting worse. The bar council members of the bar are enraged. Who are you talking about? Sir, I'm talking about the drunkards. The college students are more furious than them. I came here to buy a car for my daughter. SI Chandran has gone to the court. Is there anyone who can solve the problem? Sir, a person is there. Who? A youth for the youth. Aah... He will set things right with his speech. Ramdass, don't tense me. The newly joined "Crime branch Sub-Inspector, Subash". Hey, it's only been four days since he joined. Will he solve the problem? -definitely sir. Okay, ask him to solve it. 500 metres away is a must. Are you following the law? (crowd shouting) Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... Hey, give that. Tell... Pour it. Don't shut the public... Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... Hey, give the torch. Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... Don't shut the public... Hey, throw that. Whether to study or to take spirit? Tell... All be quiet. We'll find a better solution. We stayed quiet till now. As you didn't take any decision, we are protesting. If some problems get solved only by protesting... ...then, we have to protest. I don't deny. But, you should protest without any hindrance to the public. That's why, we're protesting on a Sunday. What's your problem? Sir, the wine shop next to our college must be shifted somewhere else. We can't bear the comments of the drunkards when we pass by. We've complained many times. Nothing has happened. We won't leave unless we get a solution. If you want us to self-immolate, for taking a decision, ...then, we are ready for that too. Who? Who said that? It's me. Did you? Come. You must not immolate yourself. You have to set this bar and shop on fire. Very nice. Sir has told you. Disperse the crowd and clear out. He is telling... Go and look after your studies. -go... I told you to study not to hit. Hey, what are you guys doing? -hey, where are you going? (Crowd screaming and instructing) Control room... I wonder what to convey to the inspector. Hey, were you trained to be a policeman or worked in a construction company? What's this? They've thrashed the entire shop. Did you go there to protect the students? If you had thrashed at least four people... ...only their footwear would've been left. No one would've dared to stay back. We can't chase them away with a stick, It's not the crowd who has come for Rs.250, a quarter of booze and biryani, ...like the politicians clan, to run away. Students! They won't run, sir. They protested on a holiday to avoid hindrance to the public. There may be a future IAS, IPS... Even a prospective minister might be there in that group. What the students did was wrong. They must have been left to immolate. Self-immolation is against law. That's why I stopped them. Police flair is new to him. So, he is not aware of our preferences. Everything will be right if his attire dries a bit. For all the praise, this is what I get. Sir, this is named beat. We must stand here the whole day. Protection for paraman's bar. It's like punishment for us... ...and also consoling paraman. They've come. Come, the fuel boy... Why is sir standing here? Don't know dude. Greetings, sir. What? Sir, why are you here? He is in duty here as he saved you. Sir, our college students want to meet you. Why? Are you going to thrash any shop there? Why? Please, come sir. You don't stand here, sir. Our college is very near. A small treat in the canteen, sir. Treat? -come sir. Please. Please come, sir. Okay, you leave. I'll come. Oh... -okay. Sir, how long to stand in this hot sun? The students are inviting us. We'll go and enjoy the treat.

What do you say now? Wait. He is not letting him speak. You are not letting me listen. Let's see what he says. Hey Subash, You tell me which is right? Four brilliants there and two of you are here. You decide which is good or bad for the country. Children are waiting for their uncle. Hi... My dear. My dear. How is it? Superb! Anshu, dear. What happened to you? My music teacher told me not to come to class. Why? I didn't go for three days. Why? -I didn't feel like going. That's why. You are my angel. You say so. But my teacher shouted at me to get out. I'm there for you. We are going to music class tomorrow. We'll meet the teacher and then sing. Yes. Be careful. Dosa... Take it. Dad, the aroma of ghee is nice. Yes. We are in the same house and belong to the same family. But so much of diversity! Are you and the children, the same? 6 feet and 80kgs of weight! Is he a child to you? Yes, until he attains the status of marriage... ...he is also a child in this house. Don't blabber, mom. Is marriage a status? Yes, brother If we earn on our own and buy a car, that's a status. If we get a degree next to our name, that's a status. All these belong to us. In the name of marriage, if we tie a nuptial thread... ...we belong to her. Then, how you'll be a child to a mother? You have good taste. Anitha is very much blessed. Why? Aren't you blessed? Who? Me? I gave you all my jewels. You pledged that in the bank. I gave... You pledged... So, you are blessed! Don't tease him to the core. He is pitiful. Today, you're Anusha and you're Vinusha. Okay. -okay. (Music class) Yes. -good morning, teacher. This girl, actually... Listen, better forget the thought of rejoining her in class. But... -what a rude girl! When I asked why she didn't come to music class... ...she replied rudely. Oh no, teacher. You've got it all wrong. She wasn't the girl who was rude to you. Her sister, Anusha. See there. Hi... Oh, twins? Yes. You aren't a rude girl like your sister, are you? No,no mam. I'm a good girl. Very good girl. Come. Bad boy, Chicha. Don't tell grandpa, okay? Okay. -thank you. Check who it is, brother. Sir, it's a call from alcohol. You turn down the call. I'll speak later. You've saved that as alcohol. But it doesn't set right for you. That is, everyone gets addicted to alcohol. Okay. But I've named the person I'm addicted to, as "Alcohol". Anitha, my fiancee. Is it, sir? Then stop aside. We'll go after speaking. She may call again. Nothing like that, brother. If I don't attend her call, She won't disturb me, until I call her back. It's an understanding. Okay, sir. If I fail to attend when my wife calls... ...she'll call back five times to ask why I didn't attend? Sir. What Subash? In the meantime, while I was away at court, You thrashed Paraman's bar, I believe? If I hadn't gone, the students might've thrashed him too, sir. Come, sir. What's the matter? Sir, our brownie is missing. -who is brownie? It's a costly breed named 'Chow Chow', sir. Okay, what should we do? Our madam suspects that someone might've kidnapped it. Our lawyer has also given a written complaint, sir. Okay, we'll rove around and find your pet. You can go. Not that sir, it's been a night since the pet went missing. We fear that it may get along with other races outside. Oh, is that so? Sir, -yes. Your thought of racism even for a pet is... You are the true Indian. You don't even need an Aadhar card. Thank you, sir. You must be killed foremost. Oh, god! You leave. Hey... Hi, sister. -hi, Subash. Anitha is getting ready. She told that you both are going out for dinner. Yes, sister. Please, sit. Okay. Hi, dear. -hi. (Titanic movie playing) That painting scene? Isn't it? I have seen that four times. Four times! Usually, it won't take this long for her to get ready. Go and check. Always into 'PubG'. Uncle... -uncle. Why are you gazing at me? Am I looking so pretty? What is this? You're wearing a similar dress like mine. How would I know? That you'd also wear the same blue denim? Please, change now. Go. Wait, I'll come. Hey... Hey Subash, Just once. -we have to go for dinner. Hey,wait. Everyone is at home. -it's okay. Just once. We've been in love for this many years. You behave naughty whenever you get a chance. Aren't you bored of that? Know something, After 15 years of our marriage... ...giving birth to children, you'll become a plumpy aunt. Even then, if I don't get naughty, when I get a chance, Either I'm not in love with you... ...or I must be in an affair with some one. Being naughty is a must for a good relationship.

Where are you coming from? Thirumangalam. Show me your license. Sir, my house is nearby. I have the RC book and license. -stop your vehicle.... Stop the vehicle. I forgot, sir. Ask someone from your house to get it. Else you leave the vehicle here and get it. I was wondering why the hands were itching. Come on... King of collections! Go... Come inside... Go... What are you looking at? Go... He thinks, he is Bruce Lee... No need to scrutinise him. Yes, sir. My neighbourhood aunt also admires me because I'm slim. Hey, it's drunken driving. Do you know how much the fine is? If it's for the government, Rs.3K sir. -you are correct. If it's for the department, Rs.500 He is good in logic. See now. Where is your helmet? No helmet. RC book? License? Insurance? That means? Then, what do you have? Not for myself, It's for the station share. I kept somewhere here... -take it out. Hey, where are you searching? Wait, sir. Take it out. Here it is, sir. I got half booze. It's the left over. Hey, how dare you drink before a policeman? Sir, the quantity doesn't matter to you. Whatever, the fine is the same. Give me Rs.100 and take your bike. Sir, is it the emergency help number 100? Don't you listen to me? Take the lathi. Okay... -hey... Take the license. Take the license. Stop the car... Hey... What happened? Hey... Subash. What, Subash? Be careful. Subash. Subash, listen to me. Whatever happens, be calm. He is the minister's son. Not only to you, it'll be a problem to all. Listen to me. Sir, he is not aware about you. Don't mistake. -who is he? He is new to the job. Do you know the price of this car? Sir, don't be angry. Please. -your lifetime salary. Please,sir. -that's the price of this car. It happened by mistake, sir. He's not listening to me, and he's simply staring at me. What? Hey! -sir, Don't be angry, sir. How dare you stare? Sir, please. To whom are you showing heroism? -I'll tell him, sir. Hey, what is his name? What is your name? -Subash, sir. Tomorrow he must call and meet me. -I'll tell him, sir. You must come and meet me. -i'll tell him, sir. If not, you're done. -please, sir. You go, sir. -whom are you staring at? The public is watching, sir. How dare you stop with a barricade! -Subash, listen to me. Go. Sir. You are not fit to open even my car door. How dare you stop my car? Sir, forgive us. You go, sir. Tell him to be disciplined. Sir, -I'll take care. Sir, no problem will emerge. -move the barricade away. I'll clear it, sir. You come. Sir... Good night, sir. Why should we retain these people alone? Send them too, brother. Tell everyone to go. Tell them to go. -thank you sir. Send them. Leave. Kabilan, tell everyone to go. Okay sir.. -I'll send them. Let's go. -come fast... Subash, What they have is not the attitude of money or hooliganism. It's their power! They'll be in the ruling party. We have to stand for their protection. If they get defeated in elections, They'll complain saying there is no guarantee for their lives. Even then, we have to stand for their protection. As we always stand for their protection, They don't respect us. "Obey the order" Under these words, No policeman can think on his own... ...or even enrage. Okay, I'll do one thing. I'll give his phone number. You give him two missed calls. Tomorrow at 9 and 10 am. Damn sure, he won't answer the calls. He'll sleep till 2pm, after boozing all night. We can tell him that he didn't answer the calls. If by any chance, he answers and asks you to come somewhere, Don't go alone. I'll also come. Okay? Thank you, sir. -okay, Subash. You go home. Who is that? Leave me. Who is that? Leave me. Do you know who my father is? Why? Don't you know? -hey leave me. Who's that? Hey leave me... Hey! Come. Chicha, phone... Sir, Subash, I'm standing down at your flat. You mean, here! Yes. I'll come now, sir. Mom, see this. -okay. Brother! -sir! Good morning, sir. Is it your own flat, Subash? No, sir. We are residing for rent. My parents are not interested in the apartment culture. So, we've built a new house in OMR. Next month is their wedding anniversary. (Shashtiapthapoorthi) So, we planned to surprise them on that day with house warming ceremony. Good, a big commitment, isn't it? Nothing like that, sir. It's a small sentiment. What's the matter, sir? You have come this far? That's nothing, Subash. Minister's son who had a brawl with you yesterday, Has been thrashed by someone. They shouldn't react on you, thinking you might've done that. That's why I came to alert you. Oh... But sir, his back has been tinkered very well. He is the sensational news in all the media. Our good time, that hotel is not under our station limits. Else, our heads might've rolled. What is in our control? Yes, sir. Even our wife is not under our control. Hey. I said about my wife, sir. Shall we follow up this case, sir? Why? It's an unnecessary job for us. Correct, sir. Someone has done our job. At least we can find and thank him. Sir, now it's the time you mentioned. Shall I give him a missed call? I can understand. You are happy inside. Chandran, have you reached the red building? Sir,I'm going to the spot. Kabilan, you come with me. You stand at the gate. Okay sir. Who are you? Are you the security? Give that stick. Sir, she was already dead when I noticed. Sir, I tested by keeping a thread near her nose. It didn't wave off. She was dead. Hey, why do you do unnecessary things? Then for what are we here? Why don't you do the post mortem also? Sir. -what? This phone was lying there in the bush. Go around. Sir, -Subash, We found the phone of that girl. But it's got a pattern lock.. Sir, I'll unlock that. The finger print would be visible in the light's reflection. Subash, just check out if there are any details about this girl. Sure, sir. Sir, it shows Mogappair. Mogappair... Sir, -what, Subash? Sir, I don't think it's a suicide. Something is fishy. Is this your intuition? We can't decide whether it's a murder or a suicide. We don't have those rights. Sir, then forensic, postmortem... Chandran. -sir... Did you inquire? We found the phone of that girl. Mogappair area, sir. Already, we've attended four suicide cases in this building, haven't we? Yes. They've probably built this building for people to jump off. File the case, mentioning it's a suicide... ...and complete the formalities. Also, inform the girl's house. Okay. Hey. -sir, Sir. Okay, sir. Sir. Sir, how did he decide without even stepping inside? "Obey the order" Ramdass, -sir. You take the body to the hospital. We will go to mogappair. -okay, sir. Subash, come let's go. Go and inform them, Subash. Sir... Go, Subash. How can I, sir? Subash, we have to face hundreds of situations like this. You'll get used to it. Go and inform. Go... Hello, I'll be late. Don't wait. Okay...bye. Yes, sir. I'm Subash. Parvati... She is my daughter only, sir. Is it for passport verification? Please, come in. Sir... Sir, he's thinking I've come for passport verification. To him... how can I sir? You must learn, Subash. You would've to explain situations more brutal than this. Sorry, sir. What's this? An accident. Come and identify whether she is your daughter. What are you saying, sir? Which hospital, sir? Not any hospital. Royapettah mortuary. Oh, no! Sir! What happened, sir? Sir, tell me and leave. -come, let's go. Sir. Oh, no! Sir, at least you tell me. -what happened? Why are you crying? Our daughter has met with an accident and is at the mortuary. Oh no, what accident? What? What happened to my daughter? What? Tell me. At least, you tell me, brother. What happened to my daughter? I can understand your emotions. The deceased is your friend. I understand very well. Hey, why don't you tell her? The girls are emotional by nature. But, you guys too? Sub-Inspector has come. Just a minute. Wait. I'm telling you. Please understand. I'll speak. First understand. Sir! Sir, everyone is enraged. -why? The deceased parents are not taking the corpse citing it's not suicide. They are creating a ruckus. I managed to my best, sir. I told them you'll come and we'll talk after that. Just... Just be calm. Be calm. See, only If you stay calm, he'll answer you. We are investigating. Please, help the police. There is no point in shouting. You girls are educated. Be patient. Understand please. We can answer only, if you stay calm. (Crowd arguing) If you do as I say, -sure, sir. Sure, they'll investigate this case. -okay, sir. Sir, how clearly we had explained. Again you have come here. Sorry, sir. We don't have clarity about parvati's death, inspite of your explanations. Whatever we say, you're only trying to convince us. Sir, I know Parvati very well. I swear, there is no chance of her committing suicide. If we don't make this an issue now, you...sorry. The police will not bother about it, sir. That's why we informed the media, sir. Sir, what's this? Why aren't you allowing us inside? Sir, we're talking. Be patient. Yes...yes... -don't disturb, please wait. Just listen to what I say. Okay. Could you try... Greetings, sir. Don't you know to end it there itself? They didn't create any ruckus or give interviews to any channels. They're sitting in front of the police station. They've called all the media channels. It's time for the DC's station visit. What ruckus to create more than this? We've filed an FIR relating to Parvati's case. The post mortem report would come only after this. We have to investigate with that and come to a conclusion. We will inquire further whether it's a murder or not. Subash. -yes, sir. Get that petition. Deal this case seriously. -okay, sir. I told you, I'll inquire. Look after the formalities. You look after Parvati's funeral. This is my responsibility! Sir, this is such a huge building. Eight gates are there. Only two securities. How to keep a track on the visitors? I had a doubt on that place when we saw it, sir. I went to that place again, on the same night. "The treacheries which don't die, Will do it chore per diem..! " "Like the crow which eats the leftover food," "If it continues, it'll destroy you..." What Subash? The van is filled with cigarette buds? Sir, they call it 'Hotbox'. They'll smoke weed as a gang in a closed room or car. The effect is more intense when compared to plain weed. This is also one of the habits which ruin this generation. "The law mustn't doze without searching for the crime...!" When I look at that place, it still seems to be active, sir. "Even if you're the last one left, don't compromise to live." "All the dogs and ghosts will wag their tails, asking us for everything we have..." Inspector sir said that already four suicides had happened there. Yes. If we meet the concerned officials, we'll get some information. "The deceit and bribe together, Enact a drama everywhere...!" "Only the truth is in your hands. Be careful...be careful..." I want to talk to you regarding the suicide case... ... that happened at the 'Redd' building. Are you new to this job? Inquiring about old cases? You should only do what the seniors say. I was inquiring sincerely, Suddenly, they asked me to close the case, mentioning it's suicide. Before I could realise, I was transferred. "If you think swindling and pestering are a single package and bend," Sir, just a minute. "there is no solution ever..." "If you fight with wrath, this world will obey you." Yes, tell me. We are in the new house, colours have to be chosen. Come soon. I'm coming there. "If you think of living like stone and sand," "A situation will arise to put you down." You select from this. Give me a minute. Come. Your room. Oh, sorry. You select the colour for our room. You know all this better than me. You select on your own. Strictly, your choice. You choose it. This one... Grey colour won't suit the bedroom, dear. Then, why are you asking me? You could've just selected. Okay. I have selected aquamarine blue. Bharati, get that shade card. Use this colour there. -okay madam... And... Sorry. This shade over there. In the past five years, six incidents have occurred. I have marked the time of the crime and the area. Can you tell me the numbers which were active in the building, then? Numbers active five years ago can't be tracked, sir. It's possible only for two years. I'll track, sir. Thank you. Okay, sir. What Subash? How come this brutal? Sir, in Parvati's case, upon inquiry of her friends and family... ...there is no reason for her to commit suicide. But, in the reports, it is clearly stated as suicide. I don't understand. The truth is known only to the deceased.... ...and the doctor who has conducted the post mortem. You don't get emotional, Subash. Sir, I have some work. I will finish that and come to the station. Okay. Yes. Doctor, a formal inquiry about the post mortem report of Parvati. Sir, I'm a government servant too. Everything has a procedure, doesn't it? Whatever it is, meet me in the morning at the hospital. Please, leave now. Sorry. Hello. What can we do for that? What do you say? Nothing. Sir, -come. What's the matter, sir? It's something important. Joint Commissioner Sarangan has come. It might be something important. Oh.... Sir, Subash. New SI, Crime branch. Good luck. I'm leaving, Chandran. Will it be so? It won't be, sir. Subash, -sir. That 'Redd' building suicide case... -yes, sir. I'm following that. Get those files and come in. Sure, sir. Sir. Another team is taking this over. I'll refer you another case. Follow that, hereafter. Sir, just two more days. I'll finish the case by then. The report has come stating it's a suicide. Do only what I say. Neelakandan, Minister of Food, is getting life threatening calls. Inquire about that. You go to his house, first thing in the morning. What? Sir, if you tell who's going to follow this case... ...I'll pass on some important leads to them. Subash, I know you're studying for IPS. After you pass the examination and get a higher post than me... ... you order what I must do. I'll do it, then. Now, just do what I say. You are just an SI in this station. Don't forget that. Go. Sir, look at how polished the minister's house looks. It was entirely built with the nutrition scheme eggs. All the accomplices sitting there are goofs. But, they'll act as if they're smart. Boss, how are you? -come. Why are you not seen at the station? Sir, for the past ten days, eggs are being thrown on the minister's house. Oh, no! The whole house is stenchy. But, he's not getting caught. We asked you to come, to find out who that is. What, he left? Tell me, Gopi. According to the timing you gave me, a single number... ...was active five times at the 'Redd' building, sir. I've messaged you the details of that number. Oh...Thank you. Who? You mean, 'Bar' Ganesan? Abhijith here. -might be... Hello, I'm the Crime branch SI, from Anna Nagar. I want to talk to you regarding the 'Redd' building murder case. Come to the golf court. Be here in thirty minutes. -Tell me, boss. If it happens at the minister's house? The eggs were thrown on the minister who distributes it. Now, sir will come after he's done with his phone call. Sir... Who are you? What do you want? Abhijith asked me to come. I'm Crime branch SI, Subash. What's the matter? I need to talk to you regarding the 'Redd' building murder case. Are you dealing that case? We told the department to drop that case. Then, why have you come? Okay, okay. I got it. Do you want money? A three-course meal, an own house, marriage, sex, children... ... that's the happiness of a normal person. But, We are above all that. See our happiness! Enjoy. If she had agreed, we wouldn't have touched her. But, she wept and ran around. That's interesting. See the next one. It'll be more interesting than the previous one. You seem to enjoy watching it. What? Are you aroused? Hey, you are making a mistake. Do you know who we are? Do you know who our fathers are? Hey, none of the rich guys know who their fathers are? You people always ask others who your fathers are... Do one thing. If you come out of this case, give a complaint. I'll find out. Now, shut your trap and come with me to the station. What did you say? Hey! Hey. If we come out, we will... What? If you come out? Section 376 D and 302, Non bailable... Don't you understand? For 20 years, I won't let you out of prison. What? 20 years in prison? 20 minutes. Just for 20 minutes... ...you try retaining us in this lockup. Sir, You... Hey, what have you done? Why did you keep them in? Sir, 'Redd' building Parvati case... -I told you not to take up that case. Sir, not only this case. They are involved in many other murder cases of girls. I have the video evidence to prove them as criminals. Don't talk rubbish. Sir, -sir. Sir, Are you the Inspector of this station or is he? I told him, sir. But, he is... On what basis, did you arrest them? Do you know the status of their fathers in the society? Show me that video proof. Yes, sir. Sir, passcode... 4455, brother. Sir... Sir... Sir... Sir, it's auto deleting. Evidence? Sir, I saw it. I said evidence. Sir. Will the murderer have the proof of crime on his phone? Idiot. Even when you are here, my son is in the lock up. A small mistake has happened. I will take care. Without having any respect for a collector like me... ...he has taken my son and kept him in the lock up. And you remained as a spectator. Shall I inform the Home Minister? or do you want me to speak to the CM? Clear this soon and send the guys out. Release them. Sir, Sir, still I can prove it. "It's an order" Suspend him. You are suspended. You should've actually been expelled from the job. Fool. We said 20 minutes. But, just 15 minutes brother. That's what we are. You think you can do anything if you have evidence? You are done. You made this day an unforgettable one in our life. Hereafter, you won't forget each and everyday in your life. Abhijith, come. Yes dad. Sir. You don't say anything. First, you go home. Tomorrow is the house warming ceremony. Look into those chores. Postpone this issue for now, sir. Whatever it is, we will check later. Be relaxed, sir. Mom! Mom! Sir. Sir, what happened? Subash sir! Chicha! Sir... Subash. -madam. He fainted in shock. Nothing else, madam. Subash. Vinusha! Go away. -sir, please. Listen to me. -sir, please. Don't go there. Please listen, Anitha. Please understand. Please, madam. First, get the child to the hospital and take care of her. Come. Go. Hurry up. Sir. Come in. Where are you taking us? -one... One... Two... -what's the suspense? You closed my eyes too. Three... Wow! Oh, my! Our house! -a new house! It looks superb. Dear! Who are you guys? Mom! Who are you? Who? Mom. Pull him over. Mom. Mom. It's a fire accident. For performing rituals to Lord Ganesh... ...they've kept the gas and kerosene nearby. As it was at dawn, nobody in the neighbourhood noticed. Sir. Sir, my family didn't die in a fire accident, like you conveyed to the media. They were murdered. I very well know who those criminals are. May be. Evidence? Sir, Sir, I can prove it. Won't the murderer know to destroy the evidence? Haven't you read about the witnesses committing suicide in such cases? All these are one-day news for dailies. If it becomes an issue, a one-day debate runs on television. That's all. The deceased becomes news to the person who is alive. Register the number '5555'. It's good. Isn't it? There is a proverb. "When the whole country runs, we must also run amidst it." "If you wish to run alone, you will vanish." Come. Thanks for the car. My pleasure. Welcome. How are you? Hey...hey... You must kill a person only once. Go. Chill, dude. Go. If you'd done what had been ordered to you nothing might've happened. I like the colour. Is it so? Sit. On time. As always. -yes. Come and meet me with a proper apology letter. I'll give you the posting in the same station. But, you must work without disturbing anyone. Go. Collector sir, am I right? What do you say? Hey, Bhuvan. Tell him, why he and the child were left alive. We would've also burnt you in the same house. But, you must regret living for losing the whole family... ...and refrain from dying for the child and go through agony everyday. The one who is growing up at your house is another Parvati. You must understand that. Get lost. Actress Pushpa is coming to file a complaint on sexual harassment. The entire media has assembled here. Come...come... Hi, Anusha. Anu, sit. You be here. Okay, Chicha. Sir. If you had obeyed my order... ...you wouldn't have to stand before me. If you go with this black mark, you can never be an IPS. Do you know that? But, your agony must not happen even for your enemy. My enemy must feel my agony. I asked you for an apology letter. But, you're giving me a resignation letter. Have you gone mad? I was mad. "Obey the order" "Obey the order" Listening to that constantly, I went mad. Now, I'm clear. After resigning, what will you do without the power of the police? I'm going to do my job. The job which I couldn't do with the police attire on... ...will now be done without the police attire. For that, I don't need the power of the police. It's enough if I have the intelligence of the police. Chandran, what's he talking about? Subash, listen to us. Please. Now, I'm not a policeman to listen to you. Public! You are a public servant. You get salary from me for your work. Now, you must do what I say. Don't you understand? I'm saying, "Obey the order". What? "Obey the order" and sit. Subash. Hey, sit. Sit. Sit. I thought the police station was a sacred place. Because of people like you, it has lost its sanctity. Still, the people have faith on it. "Justice stays long, But god strikes at last."... ...is something people still believe. I must lynch. Those four criminals must be lynched. I won't lynch them. They'll be lynched by their own fathers... ...who brought them up to be rogues. Are you dubious about how I would do this? Shall I show you a sample? In five seconds, that collector will come in search of you. He'll say his son is missing. Will you believe me then? One... Two... Three... Sarangan. -sir. Good luck. Subash. Hey, my son is missing. Sir, Bhuvan hasn't come here. Where is my son? I got a message that he is here. I don't know. The message conveys he is with you. Hey, my son. It's the car parking of this building. What are you saying? Oh, no... Oh, no... Oh, god! Bhuvan! My son! Bhuvan! Bhuvan! He's burning. Open the door. -Sarangan! Sarangan! Save him. -open the door. Go away. -save my son. Save him. Go away, sir. Save him. -sir, you come here. Sir, don't... Sir, don't... Sir, come. Dad... Sir, don't go. Sir, come. Come, sir. Sir, don't. Dad! Go away. -my son. Go away, sir. Come. Sir, come. Sir. Bhuvan! Oh no... Sir, Listen to me, sir. Sir, Please, come. Dad... Dad. Dad. Please... Sir. Sir. -drench the fire. Drench the fire. Come. Get the water. Go. Bhuvan! -come, sir. Bhuvan! Look at him. He is going. He is going. Catch him. Do something. Five of you are the best officers of our department. Do you know why I've assigned this case to you people? The one we're searching for, was in our department. He knows our department very well. He is not an ordinary person. After all, a Sub-Inspector... ...hit my son, arrested him and at last killed him. My only son... He is no more. Sarangan, why haven't you arrested him yet? We are yet to know about his whereabouts. But he knows very well how the police will search for him. For business and to reach this level... ...we have done many evil things. That's business. It was just for money. But, now someone has threatened the lives of our sons. I can understand your emotions. We're doing this only for you people. He wouldn't have thought that you'd burn his entire family. We shouldn't have underestimated him. Is he a bigwig...? That's the mistake I did. I left him, thinking he's outbursting as his whole family has been wiped off. Untraceable calls to media. Auto delete messages. Signal jammers. Ethylene gas in the fire extinguisher. The silane gas has been filled in a manner... ...that would trigger fire on opening the door. He is not an ordinary policeman, like you think. He's done many crash courses like hacking technology, Investigation and Intelligence management, Forensic science, and he's well versed in all intellectual courses. And most importantly, everything has been done perfectly... ...with precision in time. He even told me that he'd make the fathers kill their own sons. So, you want us to hide? I'm telling you to be careful. We are in search of him. If he comes in search of us, Then who are we all? Listen to what he says. Don't create any issue by doing something on your own. Without any evidence against Subash, We can't do anything. If we take action beyond that, The media would hype the news of the family accident... ...saying there's something fishy about it and the police are hiding it. I think you're right. Even my lawyer said the same. Don't be in a hurry. First, ask these guys to give separate complaints... ...stating life threats from Subash, to the Commissioner's office. I'll take care of the rest. Sir, I checked his old flat and the new house. I couldn't get any details. Sir, we're tracing down his ID, credit card and bank details. Security has been tightened, so that he won't leave the city. No...no... There is no chance of him going out of the city. Because, he's targeting certain people within the city. By protecting them, We must trap Subash. Mr.Subash. -yes. Welcome, sir. MD is waiting for you. Please come. -yeah, bye. Hi, Subash. Hi, Anusha. Please, come. My wife, Sandhya. Hi, -hi. Take them in. Come. -yeah. I'm sorry for your loss. Is whatever I asked for, ready? Subash, if the solution to murder is murder... ...it's like you consuming poison and expecting them to die. This has the details of the game I spoke about. Be ready. Shall we proceed legally, once? At least, for the sake of the child, you can change your decision. I took this decision only for the sake of that child. Whenever I see her, I think of the other child. I'm in angst because I've still left them alive. I must be in Chennai by tonight. They'll stay here for a few days. Take care. Sure. In this world, everyone is affected by someone for some reason. If everyone decides to take revenge... ...this world will turn into a graveyard. Do you think I'm doing this to take revenge? If it was so, I would've gathered all my anger... ...and lynched them, the day I saw them. It's not that! I joined the department to punish the offenders. But, they're supporting the offenders. Then, how would the criminals be afraid? They'll be afraid, only when the worst punishment is given. They must know, if at fault, they'll be sheared. That fear must be created! The day a woman can walk freely on the roads at night... ...is the day of our independence, is what we have studied, isn't it? Today, women are afraid of walking on roads even at day. Why to say all this? Is there any assurance that it won't happen to you? Do you know what he told me that day about our child? You must have the fear that another Parvati is... ...growing up at your house. Now tell me. What should we do to them? Tell me, what should we do to them? Kill them, Subash. Kill them all. With pleasure. "See the gloom of the night," "It strives to blow you down," "Every moment goes on searching for a solution." "It's the clan, knitting the net of unrighteousness." "I'm wandering in search of them." "The eyes of an eagle in the hunt for a corpse," "Even if that chases me, "I won't let this pass." "The killing fields," "Makes to wander, " "A battle field," "Will respond," "Will be cleared soon," "The evidence is not a phantom," "There are no hindrances," "The evidence is not a phantom," "There are no hindrances," "The illusions get splintered," "The solutions aren't so far," "Refuse to submit," "Break the unrighteousness," "There is nothing to question. Go beyond limits and surge up," "Refuse to submit," "Break the unrighteousness," "There is nothing to question. Go beyond limits and surge up." We miss you, Bhuvan. Cheers. -cheers. Can we believe Sarangan? Or else, shall we send our men to search for him? Definitely, we have to do something. Let's hire some professionals. Sarangan is more sincere to us than to the department. Leave it. If we do something from our side... ...our reputation will be spoilt. Tell me, Mr.Alex. "The girl who couldn't write the NEET exam consumed poison and died" ...is the news we have printed, sir. So? -but, unfortunately that girl is alive, sir. If this news spreads out, it'll be a black mark for our magazine. Reputation is important to us. Better, make the news come true. -sir! Kill that girl. Okay, sir. Yeah. Sir, I'm Gopi speaking from Cyber crime. Tell me. Actually, Subash's debit card has been swiped in Bangalore. He's definitely in Bangalore, sir. Okay. Subash is in Bangalore. Are you sure, sir? -yes. I've forwarded all the details. You start immediately to Bangalore. Okay, sir. Let's move. Hey, Deepak. Hey... No. Please, stop it. No... Hey... No. Please, stop it. No... Stop it right now. Please, stop it. No... Hey... don't do that. Please, stop it. No... Hey...hey... Please... Please... No... Hey... It's paining. Hey... Hey, please. Stop it. Stop it right now. I can't bear this. Please. Stop it. Stop it right now. Stop... Hey, stop it. No. You've only one choice. In an hour, your friend Christy must be here. I don't know how you will ask him to come here. But, he must come. No chance! His father won't allow him to go out of the house. Then, you are of no use to me. If I take the car in reverse, your body will split into halves. He'll come to see that, won't he? Please, no... No... No... I'll try. I'll try. I'll try. Please. Please. Hey Deepak, where are you? Are you okay? I created a scene on my own. And settled alone at a place. And I just don't trust this police. Still, they underestimate Subash. It's not safe for you also to be at home. Just come here, man. It's our place! But, don't discuss with anyone. Just follow the location. Okay. Sir, there. Oh, no. Go... Go and search. Even if you kill me, You can't make my son come here. If I speak, my son will come, is it? Don't be stupid, I say. Tell me, how much money you want? Let's finish this. Once... and for all... How much will you give? Two crores. That's all? Five crores. So, the cost of a life is five crores. Hey... Phone. We just followed their commands. We are not aware of anything. Forgive us, sir. Do you have five crores? You don't have it, right? Yes, dad? Christy, start immediately with five crores. I'll share the location with you. Why at this time, dad? What happened? Do what I say. I just want to finish all this. And don't inform anybody. Come, soon. -okay, dad. If you speak to him, you think he'll turn up? I didn't speak. It was you, who did the talking. Yes, dad? Christy, start immediately with five crores. I'll share the location with you. Why at this time, dad? What happened? Do what I say. Hey. -I just want to finish all this. And don't inform anybody. Come, soon. -okay, dad. Hey... Your son has left. Five crores. If you had asked me earlier, I would've thrown it at you. Why do you do this drama? I know, everything has a price in this world. Dad, where are you? Dad? Christy. -what happened? This is a trap. Christy. Go away. Christy go away. Christy, why did you come? -dad. Who did this to you? Subash is here, you go. What are you saying, dad? -go away... go man... Christy. Hey. Christy. What you said is right. Everything has a price. Your son's life costs five crores and five hundred rupees. You take the money. I'll take your son's life. Hey... No... I'll kill you man... Christy. Get up. Leave my son! Christy. Deepak... What happened, Deepak! Christy. Hey, the money has been given. You must not shout. Hey, I'll kill you. Leave him alone, man Leave him alone. Leave him. Christy. Muthu, I've shared the location. Go there immediately. Something is not right. Inspector, Subash has taken away my son and Deepak. Come soon. Hurry up. Hey... Sir... Hey... -come soon. Come soon. -is anyone there? Hey... What happened? AbhijIth is safe...yeah. If he isn't caught immediately, You'll lose your son like me. Madam, does this person stay here? By now, he would've reached the airport. Sir, we found the place where Subash stayed. For the past two days, he has stayed here. It's confirmed. He travelled by road. But now, Subash has boarded the Bangalore to Chennai flight, sir. Within an hour, he will reach Chennai airport. Okay. Tell me sir. In an hour, Subash will be at the airport. Arrest him unofficially. Sir, I'll take care. Hmm... -don't miss him. Okay, sir. Without creating any fuss, get into the vehicle I point at. Hey, drop the gun... Police... Two days back, at the premises of the Joint Commissioner of Police, Bhuvan, the son of collector Gnanasekar died in a fire accident. A person was arrested by the police today... ...as a suspect of planning the entire accident. The arrest at the airport created chaos among the passengers. For Sun News... Mugilan and Akshaya. A simple job. Can't you do that properly? We planned it perfectly, sir. But, before the public... -come on... Switch on the recorder. He has killed my son. They are talking to him lethargically. You know how the police treatment will be, don't you? Better tell us the truth. I don't understand. Where is Christy and Deepak? If you ask me, How would I know? See, how smart he's acting! No one will answer, if asked in this way. You've kidnapped both of them on the same day. You've burnt five people. You shared the location and escaped from there. And you framed the police for that act. Tell me that I started a new political party, I'm contesting elections as an independent. I spoilt the country by asking the politicians to accept bribes, include all this too. I'm tired of listening to this. What? We know very well that you have done this. Tell us the truth. Is there any evidence? What's the proof? Have you come here qualified or...? Subash... Sir, when I arrested those guys, I couldn't do anything as there was no evidence. Then, my family died in a fire accident. So, I resigned my police job and went to Bangalore... ...in search of another job and returned to Chennai. Sir arrested me at the airport amid high drama. That's it. I don't know anything else. Hey, I'll bang you to death. Muthu... I will... He is lying. He's playing some game. What's happening here? Bang him to death. What's the use of killing him? My priority is to know about Christy and Deepak. I'll plan how to kill him after that. Sir, -yes. Sir, here is the proof of Subash's presence in... ...an IT company in Bangalore and the toll gate footage of his travel. Am I mad? He took away both of them in my presence. Where have you kept them both? Two people close to you are missing, So you're trying to frame me as the abductor. Are they alive or dead? As I promised to you, I won't kill anyone. So, they're alive. I don't know, sir. Listen, you are all alone. That too under my custody. You can't do anything. I'm alone only. But I'm one among the public. You have the entire police force. Do whatever you can. -you... Sir, The fathers want to speak to him personally. Where is my son? Where have you kept him? He is alive, isn't he? If anything happens to my son! What is this, sir? Are you selling tickets outside? One by one, they're inquiring the same. It's a torture! Cameras are placed here and there... JC sir, ask them to switch off the cameras. I need to speak to him. He is telling you, isn't he? Good. I'll kill you right here at this very moment. A person can be killed only once, sir. I died long ago. But, if I'm even slightly touched, the two boys would be dead. If you do what I say, you'll get back your sons. He should inform the media that Bhuvan's death was a fire accident... ...just like how he informed about my family. Bloody, you're asking me to speak to the media? How dare you order me? Nonsense... I think he isn't concerned about your son. No. No. I won't speak. what'll you do? What'll you do? JC sir, I have two ants in my hand. If asked whether they are alive or dead, what'll you say? If you say they're dead, I'll show them alive. If you say, they are alive... ...I'll kill them and show it to you. So, we both are in not in a position to question and to respond. He is crossing his limits. You are crossing your limits, Subash. You know who those ants are, don't you? Sarangan sir, it's my son's life. So, let me handle it. What else? Hey, Muthukaruppan. Me...? Your name is Muthukaruppan, right? Get me two packs of Chicken biryani. It's been a long time since I ate well. Don't I need to remember where the guys are? I guess, both of them aren't concerned about your sons. Sarangan, please. Please. Muthu, -sir. Hey, don't poison the food. The ants would die. Also, I want a television with a big screen. I must watch JC's interview. Yeah, yes... The car fire accident that happened at this building... ...where the collector's son, Bhuvan died, requires clarification. I wanted to meet you all for that. It's a confirmed fire accident. The forensic report proves that. Oil has leaked through the exhaust pipe. Octane petrol was used. That's why, we couldn't control the situation when the car caught fire. Excuse me, sir. May I know why Subash is under police custody? You are? -I'm Subash's lawyer. You have arrested him at the airport at gun point. Under what case has he been arrested? Which section? FIR details? Even if not for the media, You ought to answer me. We suspect him of kidnapping two people. Interrogation is going on. Is this the interrogation? Is he alive or not? I want to see him. He'll be produced at court, tomorrow. Whatever it is, you can meet him there. My friend is a lawyer. She's headstrong. Muthu, -yes, sir. Media has become aware. We have to handle this case carefully, hereafter. Produce him at court tomorrow and get permission to interrogate... ...under our custody for a week. Okay, sir. Let me see how this bloody fellow escapes. Tell me now. Where is my son? Where is my son Deepak? Whose son should be found out first? Deepak... My son, My son, Deepak. Christy... Don't fight. I'll give you both, a number. Whoever gets the line first, is the winner. You've given only nine numbers. At least, find out the rest. Deepak, dad here. What? Dad! Hey, I've been searching for you all these days. You orphaned me when I was five years old, didn't you? Shit. Wrong number. Christy. Hello -Christy? Hello, ask me directly for an escort. Who's Christy? Shit. Hello. Christy, Christy, dad here. Hey, is it you? Hey, where is my son, Deepak? -Christy, it's me...dad. He is the winner. Christy, first. Christy, it's dad speaking. Believe me. -give it to me. Hey, Christy. Uncle? Christy, don't panic. Uncle, I thought it was Subash. Tell me, where you are? Tell me, where you are? -I don't know where I am. Christy...Christy... -hey. Give the phone to him. Christy, -dad. Dad, I'm afraid. Don't be afraid. Where are you? Ask him to follow only what I say. Follow only what I say. It's very gloomy here, dad. Ask him to clap twice. Clap twice. Clap...! Dad, the lights are on now. Ask him whether Deepak is there? A red colour bag would be there. Ask him to take that and do what I say. If he tries to do anything smart, He will be dead the next moment. Is there a red colour bag? Yes, dad. Go out with that. The door has a number lock, dad. Number lock? That is '4455' The door opened, dad. Where are you? Somewhere near the airport, dad. Ask him to go to the airport immediately. My fiancee Anitha will come there. Don't hang up, until I ask you. You go to the airport immediately. Muthu, you be here. Check all the departing flights from now. Check the IDs also to find out the destination of the tickets... ...booked in the name of Anitha. Christy, have you entered the airport? Where are you? I'm near gate 3, dad. Ask him to go to gate 1. I have come near gate 1, dad. What next? Tell us. There is an ID card and a flight ticket for him on the side of the bag. Ask him to show that to security and enter through gate 1. I have come inside, dad. What should be done now? Ask him to wait at the check-in counter for Anitha. Ask him to hand over the bag to her and leave. Have you come inside? Yes, dad. Check whether anyone is following you. No, dad. The police and public are near you, aren't they? They are dad. So, you're safe! You stay there. Within ten minutes, our guys will be there. Okay, dad. You are making a mistake. With my help, you made my son... ...wander like a dog. I'm not going to leave you. Listen to me. -hey, stop it. Why should I listen to you, hereafter? My son is safe at the airport. Dad, whatever happens... Don't leave him. Kill him there. Christy... Christy... What's that sound? What's that beep sound? Christy, what are you doing? Talk to me, man. Christy... Christy... Christy, what's happening? Christy... Hey... Hey, Christy... Drop the gun... Christy... Hey... Drop the gun... I said put the gun down... Drop the gun... Christy! Sir. Christy! -what happened? What happened? Hey, Christy! Talk to me, man. Hey, Christy. Christy! Hey, Christy. Flash news... Gun shooting at Chennai airport. One dead. They killed him... A young man, entered the domestic terminal of the airport with a gun. I already told you to listen to me. Now see, you've killed your own son. Francis... Hey, get me the water. -sir. Hey, get me the water. -sir. Hey! Even after the warning of the CISF soldiers... ...without obliging, he fired the gun. As a defensive step, he was shot dead. You saw that? This is also Subash's plan. I can't keep quiet even after this. He is under police custody. How could've he done that? Why did Christy go to the airport with a gun? You don't get it. He is not a fool to go to the airport with a gun. My lord, SI Subash has dealt an unrelated case in which... ...he had arrested four guys and locked them up. In fact, he even threatened to kill them. We suspect that he kidnapped two of them and killed one. We still aren't aware of the other person's whereabouts. Until we get back Deepak alive, grant us permission... ...to interrogate him under police custody, for a week. This is my sincere request, my lord. You? Lord, everything is dubious for the public prosecutor. They've fixed in their minds that Bhuvan was killed by Subash. They arrested Subash in the airport like a terrorist. But, after an hour, Joint Commissioner Sarangan sir... ...informs the media that it was an accident. Then, they claim he kidnapped two other people. One of them was caught at the airport with a gun. So, the CISF soldiers shot him dead. That was yesterday's breaking news. Now, they're asking for police custody again for the sake of another person. It's clear that the police department has other motives. So, I request you not to grant police custody. My Lord, here are the flight ticket and video footage evidences of Subash's trip to Bangalore and Chennai. I want the right evidence for everything. No proof is given on your favour. First, search for the guy who went missing. That's your duty. Then, to interrogate him, not a week... ...I'll give you just one day. You shouldn't hit him. Understood? What? Okay, madam. You think I'll leave you, if the judge orders not to hit? Even if I kill you, I know how to handle it. I'll give you an hour. If possible, save the other guy. Hey... Hey... Deepak. Deepak! Sir...sir...Deepak's video. Sir, we're unable to track this. Wonder what Cyber crime experts you all are! Who'll find out then, if you aren't able to do? This programme seems to be very complicated, sir. We can source some illegal hackers and try it. Legal or illegal, I just want it. Just do it I say. Welcome sir, look at what he is doing. Look at him. Sir, hackers. -oh, okay. Just take them there. In our country, rape has become a daily news. Everyone updates their status on social media that the law... ...must be stringent against rape.
