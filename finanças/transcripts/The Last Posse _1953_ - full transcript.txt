[♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] MAN: They're coming! They're back! The posse's back. They're comin' now! [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] Hey, I don't see Droon with them. Been here for hours? I don't know. That Sheriff looks half dead. MAN: Sure does. [♪♪♪♪♪] [TOWNSFOLK CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] MAN: Someone get Dr. Pryor, quick! Give me a hand. Todd. I've been so worried. I am glad you're here. Obviously I'm here. Thank heavens you're all right! We've got to see about the Sheriff. [TOWNSFOLK CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Take him up to his room and easy with him. I'll get my bag. Has he got a chance?I'll do what I can, but I'm afraid there isn't much hope. MAN: You heard what the doctor said; easy with him. I'm glad to see you're back, Jed. You're all right? You're not hurt? I'm all right, Deborah. You seem changed. We've all changed. We were in that desert a long time. It can change anybody. See you later. What'd the doctor say? JED: Not much chance. Hello, Jed.Judge. Gentlemen. What happened out there? Well sir, we did what we set out to do. Mr. Emerson, you tell it. It was no picnic Judge. When it was over, four men were dead. One of them was Samson Droon. Looks like the Sheriff won't make it either. Case of enforcing the law. We all did our best. About the money, it'll have to be held in custody of the court, now that Droon's dead. We couldn't find it. You couldn't find it? A hundred and five thousand dollars? He must have hidden it somewhere before we caught up with him. We couldn't find it. Droon lived long enough for us to witness his oral will. He left everything to Jed Clayton. Thank you gentlemen. I'll arrange for an inquiry. You're a good posse for a good sheriff. Well, I won't bother you any longer. There's still a sheriff. What if by some miracle he recovers? Let him. It'll be the delirium of a dying man. Besides, it's five against one. Let's get cleaned up. That's right go on and drink some toasts to yourselves. Five big heroes. You talkin' to yourself friend? Huh? Oh yeah, I guess I was. Stranger in town?Just got in this morning. Glad to know you! Stoakley's my name. Whiskey. Davis is my name. What's this all about anyway? It's all about something that should never have happened. Care for a drink? Delighted.Good. As I've said before, it's all about something that should never have happened. The day I got into town, they were having an annual celebration 'Founder's Day' they call it. All the usual things, speeches and bunting hung all over the place... The inevitable speech-making by those stalwarts, the town's first citizens. And, Robert Emerson, founder and owner of an enterprising newspaper the weekly Roswell Gazette. [APPLAUSE] ANNOUNCER: Twenty-five years ago, Roswell had its beginning in two adobe buildings. Today, we're prosperous and progressive. We take pride in our school, in our church, but most of all, we are proud of our respectability. Much of our success is due to the men on this platform. Judge Parker! [APPLAUSE] Arthur Hagan, who gave Roswell its bank. [APPLAUSE] Claude Mitchell, who opened the first law office. [APPLAUSE] And Frank White, who's splendid new store you know as Morley's Emporium. [APPLAUSE] Ten years I've been selling booze in this town, but ten years I've had to listen to the same speeches. I think of this town, less than ten years ago, when violence and lawlessness stalked our streets. When the six gun settled more disputes than our courthouse. And I think of one man, a man who put an end to our lawless days. Eight years ago, he wiped out the Jenkins gang on this very street. And since then we've known peace. I speak of Sheriff John Frazier. Unfortunately, he is ill and cannot be with us today. I'm happy to say it's nothing serious, just a case of an upset stomach. You mean a case of whiskey, don't you? [LAUGHTER] [BANDS PLAYS UPBEAT MUSIC] [CAT MEOWS] STOAKLEY: Hello, John. Well, my old friend Stoakley. Good to see you. How have you been? Fine. I thought you went away? I did last year. Now I'm back again. Oh, sit down. Sit down. Thanks. You know John, you ought to be out there. Out there? What for? To take a bow. You've done more to put this town on the map than all those so-called... pillars of respectability out there put together. It doesn't matter.It does to me. You're the man they should respect around here more than anybody else. Respect... the only men I ever respected were those I fought. And they respected me. But they're all gone now, that was a long time ago. Everything's peaceful now, civilized. Civilized, ha. That's a very unpleasant word, John. Every time I hear it, I lose a customer. You'll always have a good account in me, Stoakley. When I think of the men you've had to kill to make these roads safe for a peddler like me, I get so mad I could drink my own liquor. That's a good idea. Let's have a drink. I'm sorry, I thought I had some left in there. That's all right. Let's go over to the hotel. We'll buy back some of that liquor I sell them. You are a friend, aren't you? C'mon, let's go. [DOOR CLOSES] [PIANO MUSIC PLAYING] Thank you. Here, John. Thanks. I'm sorry, Stoakley. Nothing to be sorry about. Remember what I said, Art. We'll do it my way. You're wasting your time, Pa. You'll do as I say. We've made history here today Mr. Droon. The biggest cattle deal ever transacted in Roswell. Great to sell some fine stock, Mr. Farley. And you've got yourself $105,000. Will Romer! It's good to see you, I haven't seen you in a long time. That's a fine looking boy you've got. He must be about 18 now. Twenty-two. Twenty-two. Time flies. Does it? How's your cattle, Will? It's been a fine season they tell me. Ain't you behind the times, Sheriff? You forget we were caught without water last year and were forced to sell our stock to Samson Droon. At $5 a head, I don't call that selling. [PIANO MUSIC STOPS] Howdy, Mr. Droon. What do you want, Roman? We heard you just made a deal to sell some cattle to Mr. Farley, here. What about it? You're getting some fine cattle, Mr. Farley. We took good care of them when they were our stock. Come to the point Will, I haven't got all day. Well, my brother and I... Well, we figured you'd be willing to make us a loan to re-stock our spread. How'd you figure that? Because you bought our stock for $5 a head and sold them for $35.Art! I told you you'd be wasting words! Didn't I tell you to mind your tongue? I'm sorry about that, Mr. Droon. If it's a loan you want, try the bank. We did, but Mr. Hagan won't give us a dime. He says you're running all the cattle the range will support. You Romers were dead broke when Mr. Droon made you a deal. He did you a favor. I call it stealing! [MEN MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] This is no way to settle an argument. Don't you think you're a little late, Sheriff? You boys better go. C'mon, Art. [PIANO MUSIC RESUMES] I shouldn't have hit you, Art. You'll find them all over, hotheads looking for trouble. I guess we can accommodate them. C'mon Jed, let's get that money out of the hotel safe and into the bank. It's a mighty lot of money to be carrying around. Don't you think you better take the Sheriff with you 'til you can get it to the bank?We haven't had a Sheriff around here in years.[CHUCKLES] Goodbye Mr. Droon, Jed. I'll see you next year. It's plain to see the years haven't made you any fonder John, what happened between you two? Quite some nothing to have lasted all these years. Well, there are just some things a man can't forget. What is it you're trying to forget, John? Maybe it's something I should have done a long time ago, and didn't. C'mon. C'mon, have another drink. They say this stuff loosens a man's tongue, but it seems to tighten yours. John, we've known each other quite a long time, haven't we? Uh-huh.And in all those years, something's been eating at you. Now, what is it? If it's the past, if it's the men you had to kill, you can forget it. It was your job. Somebody had to do it. Yah, you're right. I've forgotten it. Then you'd better forget Droon, too. 'Course it's easy to see why anybody might feel about him the way he treated the Romers. He broke them. He wouldn't stop until he broke them. All on account of that kid he's raising, Jed. Jed? What's Jed got to do with the Romers? Nothing. C'mon, we'll drink up. Sure, it's a holiday anyway. Here's to kindness. Pane! I'll take that money now. Certainly, Mr. Droon. You know the bank's closed today? It'll open for me, as soon as I find Hagan. Very well, just sign please. I was wondering if you were coming into town tonight, Jed. Well, Mr. Droon and I had to come in on business. Always on business ,don't you ever do anything for pleasure? This is a really big deal, Deborah. I'll have more time now. I wonder. Mr. Droon and I just closed it. "Mr. Droon and I." Always "Mr. Droon and I." Anything wrong with that? Well, I don't like to tell you what to do, but you shouldn't let anybody dominate you so, even if it is your guardian. He's not my guardian. I'm his foreman. Even though he raised me from a pup, I think I carry my own weight. Then why doesn't he let you off your leash? I've got no complaints. Maybe I have. I'm taking you to the dance tonight. Sure, if you can get away. I'll get away. Here you are, Mr. Droon. Ready, Jed? Right away, Mr. Droon. See you tonight? No time for dates, Jed. I've got things for you to do tonight. Sorry, Debbie. I'll relieve now, Uncle Will. All right, Deborah. [TALKING INDISTINCTLY] Hello there, Droon. We were going to have a private little celebration of our own, won't you join us? on the cattle deal, Mr. Droon. It'll bring more capital to Roswell and money is what Roswell needs. Who said I was going to leave it here? As your lawyer, I would advise you to. That money would work well for Roswell. I'm more interested in having it work for me. As the biggest rancher in the basin, you ought to take more interest in civic affairs. You see how our combined enterprise has brought prosperity to all of us. Now, take my store-- Well, I thought it was your wife's store, Mr. White? Well, yes, her father did finance us. What he means, Samson, is that we're all interested in Roswell. If you're looking for improvement, get a new sheriff? Where's your civic pride, Droon? Every town should have a monument to its past. We've got one that walks and talks. [CHUCKLES] Hagan, I was looking for you. I have a deposit for you.Oh, but it's Founder's Day, I'd be glad to open up for you. Be back later, folks. [WOMAN SCOFFS]Oh! Well, c'mon! This is a celebration. Let's go in. [LOCK CLICKS] I'll be right with you Mr. Droon, I just want to lock the door. ART: Stand still! Don't anybody move! [♪♪♪♪♪] All right Droon, drop that satchel behind you. Drop it! You Romers have gone crazy!Shut up, Clayton! You left us no choice. Don't talk to him, Pa. I wish you and Hagan had been reasonable Droon, the range was big enough for all of us. Drop your gun belt, Clayton. [♪♪♪♪♪] [BELT THUDS]Now move slowly to the back. That's far enough. I'll gun the first one who follows us out the door. [♪♪♪♪♪] Careful Jed! Hold up! The Romers! [GUNSHOTS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [TOWNSFOLK YELLING INDISINCTLY] What happened? Romers held up Droon! They got $100,000! [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] You can see how the circle closes in. The Romers have a start on us but there's no place to go. I'll get them, and when I do... You'll bring them back to stand trial. We want no summary justice, Mr. Droon. Of course, judge. Thanks, Jed. Hey Cord, what does he mean by, "summary justice"? Kill the Romers. Oh. SAMSON: All ready?MAN: All ready Mr. Droon! SAMSON: You'll take five men, ride east toward Portelli's. Check the passes through the Meskolarah Ridge. MAN: Right!SAMSON: Cord, you take Billings and about four men. Ride up the Pankas to Fort Sunland. Search that territory between Varn and Kerrazozo. But you left a big hole to the south, Mr. Droon! Do you think the desert will be too tough for the Romers? Jed Clayton and I will cover the desert, up to the Mexican border. [HOOFBEATS APPROACHING] We're joining your posse, Droon. SAMSON: I appreciate the offer Emerson, but it won't be necessary.We think it is. Just what's that supposed to mean? The citizen's committee was formed to maintain law and order in any emergency. We think this is an emergency. Emerson I haven't time to chaperone you and your so-called committee. I've been robbed of $105,000 and I mean to get it back. And we mean to see that the Romers are dealt with squarely and legally. I'm going through the desert. Then we're going through the desert. They'll only hold us up. Get the Sheriff down here, Jed. Tell him after he swears the posse in he can go back to bed. Jed, take care of yourself. [♪♪♪♪♪] Don't worry about me. Todd, you can still change your mind about going. It's my duty as a citizen of the community. Is it? Or is it just a chance to get away from me. Oh, there you go again! Imagining things. Goodbye, Todd. Frank, are you really going?Yes. You know you don't want to go. You're just putting on a brave front for the town. You're always trying to push me into the foreground, well, I'm there now.But this is different. This is something you have to do by yourself. Aww... [SCOFFS] Well, good luck. [♪♪♪♪♪] Swear us in as deputies, Frazier. All right, all right Frazier! Say your piece. Raise your right hands and repeat after me. I swear to uphold the laws of the territory of New Mexico. POSSE: I swear to uphold the laws of the territory of New Mexico. JOHN: And the constitution of the United States. POSSE: And the constitution of the United States. JOHN: So help me God. POSSE: So help me God. Thank you, Sheriff. Now you can fall back into bed! Let's ride! Droon, I'm goin' with you! [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] And that's how it started. They rode out, well, you saw what came back. I think I'll go see how the Sheriff's doing now. See you later. [PIANO PLAYING LIVELY MUSIC] [MURMURING INDISTINCTLY] [MURMURING STOPS] Gracious Mr. Emerson, all that time without water! Oh, don't misunderstand me. It wasn't as easy as the telling, but we're not heroes. We knew from the start we had a hard, difficult ride ahead of us. But, well, we felt it was our duty. [♪♪♪♪♪] ROBERT: After an all-night ride, the next morning found us well on our way toward the mountains. Droon and Jed leading the way, and evidently, having little respect for the rest of the posse. [♪♪♪♪♪] We're on the right trail, Jed. They're heading south all right. I've got a cramped muscle. It'll go away in a minute.Oh, that sun. It's a lot hotter out here than it is in Roswell. And this saddle feels as if I was sitting on a red-hot stove. How do you think the horse feels? Droon and Clayton, look. What are they trying to do, lose us? Don't worry about them losing us, Frank. Out here a man's no better than his horse. [♪♪♪♪♪] A nuisance, the lot of them. Don't worry about them. They won't be with us long. [♪♪♪♪♪] ROBERT: Anything we can do, John? No, I'm all right. Coffee? Thanks. [♪♪♪♪♪] [HOOFBEATS] Clayton! Droon! He looks half dead. We better help him. Frazier's in no condition to go on. He needs rest. See that he gets it. You'd better go back Sheriff. You're just holding us up. Don't worry about me, Clayton. I can take care of myself. [♪♪♪♪♪] What's he trying to do? Die with his boots on? Can you think of a better way for him to go? [♪♪♪♪♪] JOHN: How about another one? Huh, quite an appetite tonight, huh Frazier? Yeah, thanks. You've known the Romers a long time, haven't you? Yeah, they were among the first ranchers in the valley. How does it feel to track down your friends? A sheriff's got no friends, just a job. I'm glad you're feeling better John, we need you. I've been on my fair share of posses before, but this one's different. In the old days it was a case of kill, or be killed. Why don't you forget about the old days. This is today. There are some things you can't forget no matter how hard you try. They just keep growin' in ya. All this talk about killing! That's what we're here to prevent! Exactly. [♪♪♪♪♪] This is where we leave them behind. Saddle up, I'll get the grub. [♪♪♪♪♪] Care for some coffee? What are you doing up? I couldn't sleep and I wanted a drink...of coffee. [♪♪♪♪♪] You don't think they'll try to cross this desert, do you? They'll try anything. [♪♪♪♪♪] [NEIGHS] [HORSES NEIGHING]] [WIND HOWLING] [WIND HOWLING][HORSES NEIGHING] JOHN: Get off your horses! I said get down! Lead your horses! Take the reins, lead your horses, and hang onto the tail of the horse ahead of you. Do as I say Mitchell! You too, Emerson! Hagan, c'mon! Hurry up! Now, keep your heads down against the wind! [[HORSES NEIGHING][WIND HOWLING] [WIND HOWLING] JOHN: Keep your heads down against the wind! Grab hold and hang on tight! [HORSES NEIGHING][WIND HOWLING] ROBERT: Frazier, the pack horse-- it's gone! With all our food and water! Why didn't you watch? It's not my fault. The rope must have slipped. Could have tied it.I thought it was! Thought about nothing but yourself. Could've kept your eyes on it! You haven't got the brains!It was Emerson's turn to take care of that pack horse.ROBERT: Don't try to pass it. TODD: You're both stupid!ARTHUR: I won't take that! TODD: You'll take it! You lost that horse and nobody else! So help me--Shut up! This rope didn't slip, it was cut. Who'd wanna do a thing like that? Droon and Jed.But, why? Why would Droon want to leave us without food or water? For the same reason he'll want to kill the Romers even if he gets his money back. I don't believe it. You don't know Droon like I do. He likes to settle things by killing. Fifteen years ago, he killed Jed's father. What are you saying? Yah, it's true, but I can't prove it. A week after they found Clayton's body, Droon's cattle was on his land and young Jed was in Droon's house. He got the land and the son he'd always wanted. And Jed doesn't know? No, I wanted to give him the chance to grow up and be somebody. Into another Droon? I didn't figure it that way at the time. Jed must be told. Oh, I'll tell him. And when I do, he'll either shoot Droon or myself, depending on who he believes. [♪♪♪♪♪] These riders, JedThey're three Romers. You can have some water, if you've got any. [♪♪♪♪♪] There they are! I'll try and head them off. [♪♪♪♪♪] [HORSE NEIGHING] [♪♪♪♪♪] [HORSE NEIGHS] [♪♪♪♪♪] [HORSE NEIGHING] [♪♪♪♪♪] Don't try it Jed. That wasn't very smart, Droon. I didn't have to miss. All right, pick it up. Make sure you don't try it again. [♪♪♪♪♪] The fellas ought to be along any minute. Jed... ever since you've grown up I've rubbed you the wrong way, why? You've always had it in for Droon and me. Droon, yes. You, no. Whatever concerns Droon concerns me. But you don't know the truth about Droon. What are you talking about? Here they come now. Give them a hand, will you? Better ration the water, they'll drink it all. What were you and Jed talking about? Worried? Not about you, Frazier. I got a long memory, Droon. Fifteen years long. I'm warning you, Frazier! That boy means everything to me. You ever tell him anything that turns him against me, I'll kill you. [♪♪♪♪♪] Found Romer's hat. The sweatband is still damp. They're closer than we thought. There they are! [♪♪♪♪♪] ROBERT: And that was the end. We trapped the Romers in a dead-end canyon and when they wouldn't surrender, why... we had to shoot it out. You know the rest. It was tragic, but there was no help for it. [INDISTINCT MURMURING] Samson Droon was like a father to him. He's all upset about it. Well, I think it's time we looked in on the sheriff. [MURMURING IN AGREEMENT] [♪♪♪♪♪] No change. No improvement. Anything at all that we can do? Yes, you can pray. We're praying for him all right. Praying for him to die. Oh, that isn't true.You know it is. What suddenly gives you the right to such a high code of morals? You're in it as deep as the rest of us. Yes, I guess I am. Of course you're not thinking of yourselves, of how you'll slice up $105,000! Wait a minute, Jed. It's no time for quarrelling. Let's go home and get our suppers. We've got to meet Judge Parker in the lobby at 9 o'clock. [♪♪♪♪♪] [TICKING] He's slipping fast. Now remember, Judge Parker will ask you a few routine questions. Then the Droon ranch is legally yours. The four of us as witnesses just have to sign a few papers that are drawn up. Judge Parker will be here in a minute. Jed! Let's get started. You go on in, I'll be right with you. I have to go in, Deborah. I wish I could do something to help you. You can remember it won't be "Mr. Droon and I'" anymore, just Jed Clayton. What's the matter?Nothing's the matter. Is it because of Droon?It's a lot of things. Please don't ask any questions. Try to understand. Well, I'm trying to, it's just that you're not the same person. Something's changed and I don't understand. Sure something's changed. In a little while, I'll own one of the biggest cattle spreads in the territory. Does it mean that much to you? It did a while back. What am I supposed to do? Turn down what's coming to me?I didn't mean that! It's just, you should be happy this property's coming to you. You can do a lot of good with it. We'll both own it. You'll be able to have everything you've ever wanted. I'll I've ever wanted was you. Trust in me Jed, and tell me what it is that's bothering you? I've had a bad time of it, Deborah. Try to understand. I'm trying to. Maybe I don't understand myself. Well, I... I see I made it. Now you stay put. Here. Come on, drink this. Come on. Doctor's orders. That's right. How long have I been here? Now don't try to talk, John. I'll get Dr. Pryor. How long?The posse brought you in sometime early this morning. Emerson... and the others? They're downstairs witnessing the will. What will? The one Droon made out just before he died, leaving everything to Jed. Droon? A will? Now don't try to move, John. What...what else are they saying? What difference does it make? You couldn't find the money anyway, so who cares? Money... What happened? Don't you remember? You got lost out there in the desert, just before one of the Romers shot you, and killed Droon! Romers killed Droon? No, that's not the way it happened. Sit down, Stoakley. Listen to what I have to say. What do you think you're doing? I've got a job. I've got to finish my job. Whatever job you've got in your mind right now is not worth it. That depends on... what kind of price you put on what a man believes in. Whose beliefs, son? Yours? [♪♪♪♪♪] Get me the doctor, will you? All right, I'll get him. I'll be right back. And don't you move 'til I get back. [DOOR CLOSES] How is he? Pretty low. Good evening. [♪♪♪♪♪] Before we begin, Roswell wishes to express its appreciation for the fine work you men did. This discussion, as you know is quite informal. Then I'll be able to make my recommendations. Now Jed, you'll be coming into quite a bit of property. More than you know about. It calls for greater responsibility, but you've proved your right to such responsibility by the fine work you did as a member of the posse. [♪♪♪♪♪] Now Jed, will you describe the events which led to the death of Samson Droon? Jed, did you hear the judge? Yes, sir. Go on Jed, the way it happened. [♪♪♪♪♪] Sorry I'm late, judge. Not at all, sheriff. Glad to see you. But, should you be here? Yes, I should. Sit down. Thanks. Go on, Jed. The way it happened. The Romers didn't kill Samson Droon. I did. Go on, Jed. To begin with, it was Sheriff Frazier alone who captured the Romers. There they are! [♪♪♪♪♪] Here! [♪♪♪♪♪] [HORSE NEIGHS] [♪♪♪♪♪] There might be a chance we can stop them from the other side. Will! Art! It's Frazier! ART: Stay back Frazier! That badge won't help you! [♪♪♪♪♪] [GUNSHOT] Will! Tell him to hold his fire, he's only making it worse. WILL: Get outta here Frazier! Give yourselves up, you'll get a fair trial. Fair trial? With Samson Droon, the judge and jury? [GUN COCKS] [GUNSHOT] [♪♪♪♪♪] [GUNSHOT] Will! Listen to me! Droon's not running this! He's running you Frazier, just like he runs everybody else. Come any closer and you'll get hurt. We got nothing to lose! [♪♪♪♪♪] [GUNSHOTS] ART: You know I can shoot straighter than that. Go back! Come down, Will. The posse will see that you get a fair deal. It's no use, Frazier. Droon's out to kill us and you know it. He's been looking for a chance like this for years. I know that. That's why I want you to give up. If you don't, you won't have a chance. Come down and I'll do everything I can for you. We're staying right here. JOHN: Shut up Art! I'm talking to you, Will. I give you my word. I've never lied to you. Have I? Think back, Will. Have I? He has always kept his word, Art. Right now, I'm tired of running. When George died back there, I kind of died myself. I'm waiting for your answer, Will! All right John, we're coming down. [♪♪♪♪♪] Mr. Droon, they're coming down! The money's all there, every cent of it. I guess I was too tired to think straight, John. [GUNSHOTS] Hold it, Frazier. The Romers had it coming. You're my witness Jed, you saw what happened. Soon's they saw me they started to reach. Break away from him, Jed. If you don't you'll grow up to be just like him. You're gonna hang for this, Droon. They were my prisoners and you shot them down in cold blood. No one's hanging him. Don't be a fool, Jed. Ask him why he killed the Romers. He knows. They reached. JOHN: You know he lies. The Romers had it coming. JOHN: Sure, they knew too much. Jed, you always thought your father accidentally killed himself cleaning his rifle. Well that's a lie. Droon killed him. The Romers saw him riding away after the shot.He's a liar, Jed. He'd say anything to split us up. Let him talk. Haven't you heard enough? Haven't you seen enough? You won't shoot. Not this time, Droon. There's too many witnesses. Frazier you've reached your limit. And you've reached yours. Everything you've built for, everything you've wanted in life and got is gone. If that's true, why'd you keep quiet about it all this time? Why didn't you tell me?Wouldn't have done any good, you wouldn't have believed me.Why didn't the Romers talk? Because they were afraid to. But you talked, Droon. He didn't shoot the Romers because they stole his money. That was just a legal excuse to track 'em down and kill 'em! So you'd never know the truth, Jed. You just witnessed murder, as cold-blooded as when Droon shot your father. Look out![GUNSHOT] [♪♪♪♪♪] [GUNSHOT] [♪♪♪♪♪] [♪♪♪♪♪] It's all there, over $100,000. Yeah. What about the sheriff? He won't live to get back to Roswell. And even if he does, we're five against one. What are you thinking? We're not selfish, Jed. You could have the Droon property, and we could have the money. JED: Well, that's how it really happened sir. The four of us can account for every penny of that money. We didn't know who it was to go to! Just for safe keeping. That's admirable of you gentlemen. Now that you've failed to carry out the theft you had intended. The court could not hold you, but you'll not go unpunished by the people of this community. Jed, you're young, you've always been governed by a stronger mind. You started thinking for yourself when you had the courage to tell the truth. [♪♪♪♪♪] I want to congratulate you on the fine work you did in this case, Sheriff Frazier. The community owes you its gratitude and respect. Your Honor, Sheriff John Frazier is dead. He's been dead ever since he sat down here. [♪♪♪♪♪]
