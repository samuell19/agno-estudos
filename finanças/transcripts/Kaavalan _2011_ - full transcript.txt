KAAVALAN [The Bodyguard] My life changed only in a rail journey Bven if l have got in the middle, this story begins in Mettu patti The army major Partha Sarathy's wife Kanthimathi is pregnant for 10th month.

He would kill me -Save me. -Where are you talking from? ..from Mettupatti, Murugan koil street. Sir! Don't kill me l can forgive my enemy if he can be trusted. l can never forgive a betrayer even if he is my brother. Sir.. Muthu Ramalingam came to the village to take a life! But it is not a coincidence that 2 souls were saved because of him That was god's calculation The infant will inherit the behavior of the one who names the infant. So l expect him not to be brutal & vicious like me. He should be a serene and calm soul! ..like the earth which bears everything. l will name him that. Bhoominathan. Ammukutty & Bhoomi Nathan! Ammukutty & Bhoomi Nathan! Why do you erase it off? Because a girl's name is written along with mine. She might have liked you. That's why. So, is it your work? Are you the Ammukutty?

You will be the bodyguard for Meera. ..as Meera's bodyguard? Yes! Meera and my daughter Madhu are going to college... ..atter the vacation!

This university's courageous guy lion of the college. l welcome the leader on behalf of all! -Hai, buddy. -Get away. ls it a garland? l thought it was an Arch. Oops! You give me a heavy one.

His outfit looks silly. All are looking at us. Let them watch us. Let them know that l'm your bodyguard. This uniform is for that only. Have you gone with them in the bodyguard's attire? Do you remember what l told you? Where are you now? Have you reached the college? Yes madam! Meera and Madhu are going to their classes! l'm going behind them! ls your duty in the ladies toilet? Sir! That is... You went there wantonly. You were a rowdy in the college you studied. Many people told me that. But you were given admission in this college. Do you know why? Atter seeing your mark sheet only. You could be No.1 in the university.. ..if you hadn't been a rowdy in the college and if you studied well. You have chances to become a rank holder even now. He is doing unnecessary talk You have been pardoned off for this only reason.. ..without dismissing you! Understand? lf you go to the ladies toilet again in the pretext of your duty... l won't go unless you tell me. -Ok go. -To the ladies toilet? Go to your class. He is bothering me too much. See him! Sit down on the floor. lf the desk breaks off.. they will blame me. What is this? Go and sit there. The one with a smiling mouth has come. Go and sit. l told you to sit. Why? ls there any problem? Bodyguards won't sit. Bodyguard! What for? What's your name sir? Whoa! Careful.. Move a little. That is.. You should concentrate in the class! lf you look here and there, you won't be able to understand. Are you coming to the college to study or for the fashion parade? l didn't ask you! Are you Meera? Whoever it is, all you want is the answer! He is there for giving protection for Meera. Who will give protection for me? That's why l told you to be friendly with Bhoomi! Not at all. lf he has to be brought in our way as you think.. ..it could be possible only with you girls. -Just have a try. -Don't you like us being alive? l didn't ask you to go to him and tell. l mean over the phone! Do you know how many girls love me over the phone? None of them know who l am. That's the advantage of the love in phone! Be quiet. None has to change him over the phone. Tell an idea how to change his uniform.That's enough. l feel jealousy when l see your uniform. You haven't given me a chance to wear this. -Give me the chance to press it at least. -No. You go and have bath and have food. l will do the ironing work. -Go and mind your work. -l am asking the work only. Go and sleep. You are not lucky enough. See what he is doing! He seems to have worked in the tiffin shop before. Ouch! Mom! He has enough monkey acts it looks! l should be alert while go for sleeping! What is that strange smell? Has anything happened to him? Oops! Who might have done it? God! Show me the one who has done it. What happened? Who is yelling? l will bring an end to your nuisance! Why did you do that? Save me! He is killing me. Save me. Leave him. l tell you to stop it. ls it the time to quarrel? l didn't quarrel with him. He pressed me with the hot iron! Look where he has done it! Look madam! All see it. He has pressed it in the wrong place. Nasty. How dare you show the place? l showed my trouser where you have pressed. l didn't do anything! l was sleeping! lt was him who has pressed the iron on me. -Didn't you do anything? -Yes! -l told you not to do anything! -Yes! -Why did you do this then? -What did l do then? Look, what has he done. He could've stolen it instead! He made holes in it and made it useless. Yes! ldiot! Who is the idiot who has put holes in it? l want to know it now. -lt's you. -Me? How could l do that when l was sleeping? Somnambulism! Take me to a lone place and scold me l will accept that. lf you disgrace me before the girls our friendship will get cut. Somnambulism is a disease which the patient walks in sleep. -Me? -Bnough! -Me? -Bnough, sir! lt is atter all pants! Why all this chaos? What will l wear in the college tomorrow? Don't you have any pants and shirts with you? This is my uniform! Are you an LKG student to wear the uniform? That's it. What's the use studying big LKG studies? Has God created us to rub the iron in one's back? -Leave it -Switch off the light and sleep. From today on wards, the uniform matter.. -What are you searching? -Where is the other iron box? Another iron box! Look! There are two holes! But the iron box is only one. Where is the other one? Look under the bed. What is it? Whoe! Wait. A fire burn can be cured but not the verbal abuse Poet Kannadasan has told it once! ls it Kannadasan or Yesudas (singer)? Poor guy! He has got confused. Bither he or she won't allow me to sleep. Let the marriage be over. Meera! Madhu! Open the door. What happened to you? Why do you yell up? -Come fast. -What happened to her? -Look there. Hasn't the size taken correct in sleepy mood? lt is little over size! The tailor has told the same. Whether you are my boss or a lunatic! Where did you get the uniform? lt was been tailored, the whole day! Bnough! Haven't you got ready yet? -Come fast. -Poongodi, come here. Didn't you hear the boss? Go and bring salt.

You go home with them Don't do anything to me. Devaraj is the reason for everything. -Where is Devaraj? -Don't do anything to us. To tell the truth, he has gone to US. -Has he gone to US? -That nobody should suspect him.. He did all arrangements and has escaped. He wouldn't come back. He will be alive till he is there. Tell him. -Dad! -Nothing has happened to you, right? No mom. You need not worry, mom. Bhoomi was there with us. We sent our girl to you believing you! lt is like your parents has sent you to me believing you. You should not go for any violence. But l myself have sent you for that.

You are teaching those learned girls, ignoring me All the doors have closed. Boss! He forgot to put the lock as he was annoyed. See what my dad has done! When l wanted to avoid the guy he was made him our master. He is not a master, but the head master! He was innocent and caring at first. Now he acts as a military officer! He could smile at us a bit at least. Hey stop! Madhu! We should bring Bhoomi in our way. Find a way for that. Forget this foolish act and try to get some sleep. You have to get up at 4 in the morning. None can change him as you think. Bonsai told before all the girls to try to love Bhoomi in the phone! Did anyone try it? Forget love. No girls have the courage to stand before him. lf so, what if l tried myself? Why should you try? Don't spoil your prestige. He wouldn't know it is me. How will you talk if he doesn't know it is you? This mobile restricts the caller lD. lf you call in this phone, the phone number will not come. lt will come as the private number. He can't find me out, right? He could find you from your voice. l'll change my tone when l talk. Another tone? How is that? l am your fan! Can he find out with this tone? No. Not at all! How did you do it? That's it! Meera! Don't play. lt will pose a problem. Nothing like that. You shouldn't tell it to anyone. What is this private number? Who is it? Can't you hear me talking? Who is it? l'm asking you. Won't you talk? The phone has to be in the dust bin. -Who? -Bhoominathan! -Which Bhoominathan? -The Bodyguard! l didn't ask you, boss! l asked you who was talking to you in the phone. l too asked that but no reply. You could as well dial the number and ask! No number has come! The phone comes without a number. ls it possible? Go to sleep then. You can talk only when the number appears. How roguish? Boss! Stop. lf the party keeps silent even atter hearing our voice.. ..it will be a shame for us. Now l will talk. How dare he is? Boss! lt is a girl! Girl? Which girl? Ask her from which number is she calling! From which number are you calling? Whom do you want? l want to talk to Bhoominathan? The phone is his... but the tone is mine. -Who are you dear? -Lover! Why should your lover call me in my number? lt is your lover boss! Only your lover would call in your phone! Who are you? Are you playing with me? l'll whack you up. Keep it down. ls it a coconut? lt is a cellular phone. Abraham Lincoln would have toiled much to invent that! Was it Abraham Lincoln or Abdul Kalam? He himself has got confused. We will ask him in the morning! The idea has been worked out! lt's enough for him The rest can be tomorrow. Open the door. You both get ready and come downstairs. -Get up! -Meera, get ready! -Fast. -Damn it. Meera! Get ready fast and come. Or the head master would come up. Attend it. lf you cut it he would call you again! This look like a phony number. No need to attend it. -See! -You could switch it off. Sir has told that the phone shouldn't be switched off. -Keep quiet. -lt has got cut. Why do you tell it again and again? l have do urgent work. Go fast. You... Have you disconnected it? You are safe as you have cut it. lf you are caught l would kill you. Keep quiet. l can sleep peacefully now. Meera! Get up and get ready. Why do you wake me up so early? Do you know what the time is? The bodyguard has got ready with his uniform at 7. Damn uniform! l'll have to do something for that. Parvathi Nambiyar! l've picked up Bnglish. Boss! A Parvathi Nambiyar calls you. -ls it you? -Who is that Parvathi Nambiyar? lt is not Parvathi Nambiyar. lt is private number! ls the spelling same for both? lt is her. You have come! l was expecting you till now. You haven't switched it on. You could talk only if you switch it on. -You can go. -lf you have understood, it is good. Have you called me boss? lt's the girl. Don't talk in the phone. Come in person! l will cure your insanity! lt can't be cured. -l am crazy atter you! -What? l like very much the uniform you wear, cap, glasses, your walk and style! -You are my hero! -Hero? Whose hero.. what hero? l didn't wear this uniform for you! When a mad person like you calls me up.. ..and tells me that you like me.. ..do you expect me to come atter you? lf you call me again, you will lose your phone and get hurt You have to know who l am. Whatever it is.. You'll get hurt in any case. Keep the phone down. -What happened? -lt will show he respects my call.. ..if he wears the uniform again! lf he changes his uniform it'll show he responds to my call -Uncle! -What is it? Bodyguard hasn't wore the uniform. Didn't he wear? How do you know it? -l peeped through the window. -Did you see! lt was very superb! You saw the nasty scene and tells that now to the would be. -l will.... -You foolish uncle! -He is wearing the color dress. -Colour dress? Who did he ask to wear it? Why do you look there again? What is this nasty dress? -He looks very superb! -Stupid! ..stop blabbering. Bhoomi! Why are you in this new dress? ls it your birthday? lt will be like this, henceforth. There should be some change in life! -l didn't like this change! -l too don't like you! How bad was his word? Our treatment has worked out well. The one who hated the women before.. ..is now watching them very well! Don't look! Come. You are very kind Look at the dress of the bodyguard. You have changed the uniform and have come stylish! Have you gone for your engagement? Yes! l'm looking out for a girl! lf l get her, l'll see to her. -ls it okay with you? -lt's okay lf he knew that we are those we will be finished. Coward! lt looks like you will show us to him! Come quietly. Why do you laugh? Stop! Tell it again! Tell it again! Once again sottly. Tell it quietly. You can go. He is coming. Who are you! Where are you? l am here only. Where are you? Tell hello. Tell it in the phone. lt is nothing. lt is here... l am asking you. Where are you now? You have quarreled with a girl. l crossed you only then! l will find a solution for you today. You talk... and keep talking. l'll find you in 15 minutes! Why do you bother much? Tell me that you love me! l'll be before you the next moment. ..with a stylish smile! -Smile? There won't be a tooth lett in your mouth. Do you want love? Not only 15 minutes. You will have to search for me for your life. l will not love you if you call me the entire life. The moment l threw it away when you told me.. ..that you like me... know it? You look handsome in this dress! But you have to tuck in the shirt. Your hair style is like Gemini Ganesh. You have to undo the hair and redo it with the hand. That's the latest trend. l will tuck my shirt and do the hair. You don't have to worry for that. Tell your name if you have courage. Why do you need the name? You can call me Ammukutty as well. -What? -Ammukutty! Ammukutty! Hello! Are you Ammukutty? You look handsome in this dress! But you have to tuck in the shirt.

She is waiting for me in the railway station. lf l don't go then she will.. Dad! Please.. lt is true what he is telling to me. Please leave him. -Ok, you go. -Dad! You can go! Bye sir! Meera, l'll go. Your dad might think only about death at that time. lf l didn't get into the train at the last minute that would happen. Station will come soon. Get ready with your things. Meeting has not finished for me. l am in next cabin. How much you loved my mother? Why did you ask suddenly? Your mother is life for me. Your mother also loved me very much. She have told me that l wouldn't go to Semmanoor.. ..before her death. l agreed because you are very stubborn. Come. How was your journey? Where is your son? Come. l am waiting for you. Come. Sir, see who has come! Bhoomi, have you come? Come. -Sir, you take rest. -l am alright. Sit down! l thought you wouldn't come. Will l refuse your words? Sakkarapani said that your next posting is in Australia.. ..and you have come to this town in the middle. That's why l wanted to see you. Am l disturbing you? Sir, what is this? Nothing like that. You tell me sir. l thought that you would ask about Meera when you come here. But you didn't ask anything. Sorry! l forgot that. How is Meera? ls she in London? Or has she come here? Meera is here only. ls she here? Then why didn't she come out? When did you come from London? Have your husband and children come? Where are they? Are they here? Meera didn't marry anyone. Why didn't marry? Why? l have told otten to my wife. He'll be a lucky man who is going to marry Meera. l couldn't find that lucky man. She found out. But l don't know to unite them. What is this Meera? l didn't think that l'll be seeing you in this situation. They said you brought your son with me. Where is he? l haven't seen him. Do you know who is she? She is Meera aunty. Poor Meera! She didn't expect this situation.. ..when she sent your dad to lie them. Dad please.. lt is true what he is telling to me. Please leave him. -Ok, you go. -Dad! You can go. He said lie. Don't believe him. l'll find out who is telling lie. -Palani -Sir! You follow him. You leave him when a girl is there as he told in the train. -Blse you kill him. -Ok sir. Come. How did he know? All are asking me. But l said no. That is good. Come with me. You have to do one more help for me. You go to station and meet Bhoomi. -Me? -Yes! Dad has sent the men to the station. He told to kill him if his lover is not there. Oh God! That's why l am asking you to go. Bhoomi has to know all truth now. Tell him that l have only spoken in the phone. But you have to tell him that he shouldn't fight for me.. ..and l would be waiting for him life long. Will he believe me if l tell him all this? We have no way. He doesn't have phone to call. Blse you do one thing. You go there and call me. l will tell everything to him. Go. Go quickly without knowing to anyone. There is no train atter this. This is the last train. Come. Come. ls it you? You could have told me! Bhoomi, l am.. Yes sir! lt is true what he said to me. A girl is with him. l have betrayed Meera which a friend won't do ever. Not only me. Who will miss such an opportunity to marry him? That's why l brought your dad so far away. God has given the punishment because l did this betrayal. l am not lucky to live with him who has achieved everything. lsn't it? You will get this diary long atter my death. You should destroy it without anyone knowing it. Because your dad shouldn't know this truth ever. -Why? Didn't you sleep? -l didn't get any sleep. -Siddarth, are you crying? -No. Don't lie. Your dad wouldn't lie. Then his son also shouldn't lie. Why did you cry? l remembered my mother. Sleep. l will be with you till you sleep. Aunty, are you angry with my mom? Angry? For what? l am not angry with your mom. l felt very sad. Your mom didn't say to meet me before her death. That's why l felt very sad. You should forgive my mom. l am alive to see you and your son and ask pardon to you. Sir, don't say like that. You will be very healthy when l come next time. Then, l take leave. Say bye to her. When will you come to see me again? Shall l call you as mom? Ok, you can call me. Then, will you come with me as my mom? Siddarth, what are you talking? Say sorry to her. l am telling you. Say sorry to her. l won't. Sorry sir. He didn't misbehave like that before. l don't know what happened to him. Don't mistake me. There is nothing wrong in the child's mind. You are also innocent. But in our mind.. Siddarth asked her what l watned to ask. l want to see my daughter to live happily. Will you take her with you? Sir, what are you saying? Sir, l haven't thought about Meera like that. l'll obey you. But this is... Meera, what he told me... How can l...? All these things in my life... Do you agree to come with me? Ok, l take leave. -Where is Siddarth? -He didn't come inside. He was standing with you outside. Your attention, please. Where did you go? l went to the toilet. Toilet is available in the train, isn't it? Take him. Where did you go? Come! Bye. To my dear son Siddarth.
