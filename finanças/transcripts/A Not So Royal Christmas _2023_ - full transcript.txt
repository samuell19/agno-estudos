Sorhagen Palace was first built in 1536 and later renovated in the 18th century. And ever since then, there's been a royal decree for the grounds to be decorated every Christmas. As you can see, everything from our ornaments to our silver bells tell a story of the legacies of the Counts who once called Sorhagen Palace home. -Is Count Lars actually living here now? Will we get to see him on this tour? Or is it true that he hasn't made a public appearance since he was a teenager? -Uh, the current Count prefers to work behind the scenes. Now, the original stone was forged... -Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait! Is it true he doesn't show his face because he lost his nose bullfighting? -The Count's nose, I assure you, is very well intact, and you should not believe the conspiracy theories that you read at gossip sites. -Ah, you all are in luck today. This is Sir Gustus, the Count's Royal Advisor. -Ah! So you can tell us if the Count is actually here? I mean, it's the only reason why we came on the tour, anyway. Right, guys? -On behalf of Count Lars, we are so happy you chose to spend the day visiting Sorhagen Palace. We hope you stay the month as Christmastime here is always magical and the town's festivities are open to all. A word? -Just one moment. I don't think we're seeing the Count today... -Remember, the less Count talk, the better. -I know. I'm sorry, sir, I'm trying. They just keep asking. -Only three today? -The most we've had this month. Do you think if he made one quick appearance, we'd get more sign-ups? -Remember to highlight that the oldest Christmas lights in Northern Europe hang in our library. -Yes, sir. Come on, somebody! Give me something, something for the ladies! - Oh! - Yeah? The Queen and the Duchess of Doverly showed up wearing the same dress to the Royal Banquet. -"Fuel to the fire of the feud." Yeah, what else? -Ooh, uh, there's a rumour going around that the Prince of Bulgaria invested his entire trust in his girlfriend's nightclub. -Yeah, we can work with that. Something like "Party prince pays the price." Jot that down; I'm not gonna remember. Come on. What else? -Um, so apparently, the Earl of Greyson fathered an illegitimate child in his late teens and he's spending this Christmas with the family in the Swiss Alps! -Bingo! That's what I'm talking about! -The irony, of course, being that his great-great-grandfather, the Earl in 1885, secretly fathered a baby with the... what? - Oh, oh... I'm falling asleep. -What, why? That's a good story. -No, it's so boring. Skip the history lesson, alright? This is RGE, Royal Gossip Entertainment. We stick to the now scandal. Let's get to it, people! Time is money! -Um... Hey, Tony? Can I speak to you for a second? -Yeah, I always have a second for you. Is this about your story about the Baron's botched tattoo? I trust your sources, yeah? -No, no, no, it's nothing like that. It's, um... Okay, so next month will be my five-year anniversary working here. -And we've been loving every second of it, yeah. -Thanks! And you could say I've published some pretty major stories in that time. - Some of the best! -Good, yeah. I was hoping I could ask for a raise. -Oh! A raise, yeah... Now's not really a good time, Charlotte. Sorry. I mean... you see how it is around here... they barely have enough to pay me. But I'm really looking forward to your piece on the Earl. Yeah? -Oh. - Yeah, we're done. - Oh. - Yeah. - Oh... okay. Ugh... -Guessing it didn't go well? You could always threaten to leave. He knows you're an asset. -It's just my visa is up next month, and if he calls my bluff I have to either leave the country or find another job. And let's be serious, it's not like any credible news organization like Monarch Insider is gonna hire me after working here. -Well, you're always welcome to crash at my flat. -Thanks. That's really kind of you. -I don't know how you're managing ever since your ex moved out. -I actually had to dip into my savings this month. -Offer still stands. -Thank you. I'll keep that in mind. Adam? Adam Pederson? -Jensen! -Oh! I was hoping I'd see you today. - I heard you were back in town! - Ah! -Wow! You look so different. No beard and you've really slimmed down. - Oh, it's all that backpacking. - Ah, yes, that's right! You've been all over the world. -Seven countries in ten years. -Never in one spot for too long, then? -No, still looking for that one job or that one place that makes me happy. -And now? Back following in the old man's footsteps? -Oh, well, no, just here for Christmas. You know, saving some money until the next adventure. Hey, how have you been? Who's that? -Well, a new volunteer tour guide. Trina's niece. She's quite something! -Have you asked her out yet? You've been gone too long, thinking I'm in that league. Anyway, better get back to work. Catch up later? - Definitely. See you. And, Jensen? -Yeah? -Remember, there are no leagues. You've seen where we work, right? Oh! Do you think I could pull off an ascot? -Um... it feels very formal for the office. -Really? -Yeah, I think maybe not the most... -Oh, you're here. - Unfortunately, the Count of Sorhagen could not be here in person to drop off the royal toy donation for the Nordin Children's Group, but would like to wish all the children who will be receiving these gifts, a very merry Christmas. -Why can't they just admit the guy's a flake? He's probably out partying on some yacht somewhere. -I heard he has some weird skin rash that they can't figure out. -Eww, please! Thank you. Whatever the reason, an interview with him would be a gold mine. -Uh, would that gold mine include covering my raise? Right! Because although every news source in Europe, including the Monarch Insider, has tried to get an interview with the guy, he's going to give you, a tabloid columnist, the time of day? -I got the Princess of Gibraltar to admit she laundered money. I found the Marquis of San Marino's lover's home address. I'm pretty sure I can ask a dodgy Count a few questions. -Alright, yes. If you can land an interview with the Count of Sorhagen, I'll give you a raise. -Could... could I... could I get that in writing? -Where would you even start? -Well, Sorhagen Palace throws a Yuletide Ball every Christmas, and tradition calls for the Count to oversee all the aspects. -He hasn't been seen at the ball since he was bestowed the title. He hasn't been seen by anyone, anywhere, since he was a teenager! -Well, it doesn't mean he hasn't been there. -Ugh! -Could you imagine if I land the first interview or get the first picture? RGE would go from a small-time gossip site to the biggest name in royal news. -Alright, I give you my blessing to attempt an interview with the Count of Sorhagen. But if for one second it feels like a lost cause, I want you back here straight away. -Got it. I'm gonna go book my flight. - Alright. - Okay. - Economy! - Yes. - Yes? - Yes! Are you sure you're not gonna be lonely at Christmas, huh? -I think I'm good. Plus, I got my career to focus on. This profile with the Count is a huge opportunity for me. -I always thought that RGE was more of a job, and not necessarily a career for you. -Well, turns out I'm good at it. And it pays for this apartment... sort of. -If you run out of money, you can always come home, huh? And there's always room for you at the insurance firm, too. Stability can be a good thing. And, uh, Milwaukee's a lot more affordable than London, huh? -I'll, uh, I'll keep that in mind! Listen, Dad, I gotta go, but I love you. -Love you, too. Enjoy the North Pole. -Sorhagen, Nordin. Same thing! -Okay, bye! Hello? -Oh, welcome, welcome! I wasn't expecting anyone, but so glad to have you. -Oh, thanks! - Oh, peppermint square? - Oh, yum! Thank you. Sorry it's so late. It's kind of a last-minute trip. But the cab driver said this was the best place to stay. - That it is! - Mmm! -I'm Trina. Welcome to Sorhagen. What brings you to our town? -The Sorhagen Palace. I'm a journalist. -Oh! Hopefully not from one of those nosey tabloids? -No, I'm, um... I'm from, uh, Monarch Insider. -Monarch Insider? Ooh! A proper journalist? You know, my niece just got a volunteer job giving tours at the palace. -Has she seen the Count? -She says she has. -Okay, how do I sign up for this tour? Morning, Mother. -Oh! -Mm-mm, mm. Here, let me help you. Come down, come on. -Oh, thank you. Oh, whoops! Ah. - You alright? - Yeah. -Hmm, smells fresh. -You know your dad would roll over in his grave if I ever put up fake garland. -That he would. -It is so good getting to see you here and not having to visit you on a mountain top in Zermatt or take a speed boat to Rathlin Island. -Ah, it's nice to be home, too. -Hmm, you know, you can stay longer this time. You don't have to dart off after the holidays. -I know, but I got the job in the reindeer ranch in Finland. -Oh! -Free room and board and no long-term contract. Perfect. -Well, while you're waiting to hear about yet another job with little to no future, just think how nice it is to have a mother willing to do her grown son's laundry. -That alone might actually get me to stay. Oh... What's this? -Oh, yes, I found that outside the palace. Yeah, I've been meaning to return it. -Adam! This has the Count's crest on it. This is the Count's medallion! -Really? Well... what was it doing on the ground? -You need to return this right away. The last thing you want is for someone to think you stole that! -Stole...? No, that's a good point. I'm going to do it. - Ah, ah, no... Don't go to the palace like that! I didn't iron that... -Thanks, Ma! If you'll follow me, up ahead we have the library. We can see the oldest Christmas lights in all of Northern Europe. Ah, Pederson! -Jensen, have you seen the staff manager? -He was just in the drawing room, why? -Huh... Oh, just returning something I found. I'll... I'll go find him. Thanks. -Ah-ah-ah! The drawing room is... that-a-way. -Copy that. Hel... lo? Your Grace? Oh! Uh, sorry, I shouldn't be in here, uh... -No, no, no. Wait, wait, wait, hold on! If I could just have a moment of your time... Your royal medallion... It is you. I'm Charlotte Collins and I write for... Monarch Insider, and I would love to interview you. Though, I, um... never thought a Count would be dressed so casually. At least have an ironed shirt. -So, um... let me just get this straight. You think the best way to get a private interview with me, the Count of Sorhagen, is to insult my clothes? What in the King's name is going on in here? This area is off limits to the public! -Um, Sir Gustus, is it? Hi, I'm Charlotte Collins and I write for Monarch Insider, and I would just really love to speak to the Count for a few minutes. -The... the Count? -Look, I know you want to keep a low profile, I totally get that, but people have questions. They want to know you. -If you don't leave at once, I'm calling security. -No, I totally get it. -But if you want this picture splashed across every news publication tomorrow, consider... giving me an interview? -Get out, now! -Okay, just... I'm staying at the B&B in town! -Uh, I was just leaving, too! -Why does that brusque Yankee think that you're the Count? -Uh, because of... this? -Why do you have the Count's personal medallion? -Now, I found it outside the palace on the ground in the front gardens. -Uh... who are you?! -Oh, I am Adam Pederson. I'm the new, uh, seasonal landscaper. -May I suggest you be on your way to work? At once! -Yes... yes! No, I'm gone, gone. Not even here. Bye! Monarch Insider? And you say she took a picture of this... staff member? -Yes, she truly believes she met the Count. The only way to get ahead of this is to finally release the truth. We can't. We'd go from having at least some tourists to absolutely none. -We're headed there either way. Not necessarily. If this reporter already believes this man to be the Count, perhaps a new solution has just presented itself. You could have been fired! What were you thinking? -Honestly, I was more impressed with that journalist. She just barged in there thinking that she could get a private interview with the Count. I'll tell you, the confidence that that requires... -Sounds like she's off her rocker. Besides Jensen, is there any security at that palace? Our security is the best in Nordin. -Ah, Sir Gustus! Um... can I get you anything? Uh... tea, coffee? Danish? -No, thank you. I just need a moment alone with... with Mr. Pederson. -I'll be in the back. I'm so sorry again about what happened today. - Mr. Pederson... - Oh, please, call me Adam. -Mr. Pederson, after conveying our incident to the Royal Council, much to my dismay I've been sent here to speak with you. -Hmm? -Thanks to your outright desire to lie, this reporter believes she met the Count today. If that photo is released, it will cause a crisis of grand proportion for the Royal Family. -Just release a photo of the real Count. Discredit hers. What I'm about to tell you demands the utmost secrecy. Do you understand? -Yes. Sir. -There is... no Count of Sorhagen. -Yes, there is. -Count Lars abdicated the title four years ago when he fell in love with someone on Spring Break at Daytona Beach. -Let me guess... what happened in Daytona didn't stay in Daytona? -Precisely. He's been with her ever since. He threw that medallion out the window in protest. We've been looking for it for some time. -Really? Because it was just right... well, hang on, why are you telling me all of this? -Because the Royal Council believes this is an opportunity to avoid a bigger scandal. Since this reporter already believes you to be the Count, will you step in asthe Count for... a brief interview? She'll have to turn over the photo in order to speak with you. We'll satisfy her curiosity, allow her to publish a puff piece about how polite and cordial the Count is. Oh, you're serious? -Just one very short, very rehearsed 15 minutes. -Are you sure that's such a good idea? -The Royal Council knows that businesses here depend on tourists believing there is a Count. They feel a short interview will keep that belief alive. It's Kirsten! -Come in! -Lost you on the tour today. I was worried something happened, but then Sir Gustus told me to give you this. What's going on? What?! I've got the interview! I got the interview! Shoulders back. Chin up. Ugh... You sure this is really necessary just for an interview? -Decorum and elegance is the standard for the Nordin Royal Family. Ow! You sure you're qualified to tailor a suit? -Would you prefer that I called on Mr. Henrik, Sorhagen's chief suit-maker, and have you explain how your indiscretion with that reporter led us to this charade? Chop chop! -Feet flat on the ground. Your back, straight. Your buttocks should touch the back of the chair. Your weight evenly distributed over both hips. Got it? -I've got... ow! A hundred pins in me. The Count would never wear glasses to the press. -Hey! I need those to be able to see. -We got you contacts. Wait... how did you know my prescription? -We have resources. A reporter from the Monarch Insider will be able to tell a fake from a mile away. Remember, keep it light and fun. She needs to believe she met the Count. We must do something about your hair... Miss Collins. You clean up nice. A proper introduction this time. Miss Collins, Lars Ludwig Von Taylor, the Count of Sorhagen. Before we start, I must ask if you've deleted the photo that you took of Count Lars yesterday. -Yes, you made it very clear: no photos. -And the agreement? -Signed, sealed, and delivered. -Ah! You may commence. -Your Grace, thank you so much for allowing this. I'm very sorry for bombarding you yesterday; there's just no other way of getting in contact with you. Which brings me to my first question: why are you so private? -I feel that the best way to serve the country of Nordin is... out of the limelight. -Right, that's what all your press releases say, but what does that actually mean? -It means he doesn't get bogged down with the showmanship of the position. -Yes. However, Sorhagen's economy has suffered since your father passed, and many people believe that's because you haven't made any public appearances. You don't feel any responsibility to your country? -Uh... perhaps you'd like to ask about the Count's Children's Charity? -Sir Gustus, no offence, but maybe the Count would feel more comfortable if it were just us? -No. Copy that. Okay. Well, um, what do you do for fun? -I, uh, serve on... the Royal Warrant... Appointment... Committee and The Northern European... Trust of Commerce. Ah. Oh, you're serious? Oh, wow. Um, okay. Well, what about the Yuletide Ball? What's your role in that? - I oversee the event planning. - Oh, are you a fan of Christmas? -Yes, no, it's my favourite time of year! -Good, now we're talking! What are some of your favourite Sorhagen Christmas activities? - The Nisse Hunt. - Okay. -And then the Wreath Lighting at the town square. My dad... - Mm-hm? - used to take me sledding, and then we would stay up very, very late and watch the northern lights. -I didn't know Counts went sledding. They normally don't. -Well, uh, so it seems like Christmas is your thing. How about a special in-depth article on Christmas with the Count? Everything leading up to the Yuletide Ball. Give people a real chance to know you. -That sounds amazing. -Absolutely not! I think the Count's a bit sleep-deprived at the moment. -Fifteen minutes. That was our agreement. -Yes, um... but weren't you also the one that was telling me that the Royal Council is very worried about tourism numbers? And wouldn't an in-depth article on Christmas with the Count help? After all, I am the Count of Sorhagen. My decision. -His decision. Fifteen minutes. That's what we decided. I... I tried to stop him. I don't think he truly comprehends what a full Christmas spread with a publication like the Monarch Insider will entail. -What do we do now? -We stick to the plan. Sir Gustus will have to take charge. -Oh! -Oversee that we give the journalist tidbits here and there. And keep her and Mr. Pederson's interactions minimal, hmm? If all goes well, we walk away with an uptick in tourism and time to find a more permanent solution. -With all due respect, keeping Mr. Pederson in line might be a... a tall order. -Surely not for you, Sir Gustus. The King has the utmost faith in you. So, let me get this straight... there's actually no Count, but now you're the Count? -Yeah, see, I am... I am temporarily... pretending to be the Count. But, you see, because she's doing an exclusive on Christmas with the Count, that means that I get to stay at the Palace, which apparently means that I can order anything from the kitchens. Now, that is a pretty sweet gig. This is madness! -Actually... come to think about it, I probably shouldn't be out. Sir Gustus gave me a lecture about keeping a low profile because, well, the journalist... she's staying at Trina's B&B nearby. -Oh, then she's probably met Kirsten. Maybe you could, uh, find out if they know each other? -Oh, yeah. No, sure, in addition to pretending to be the Count I'm gonna ask a prestigious journalist to play matchmaker to the B&B owner's niece. -Wouldn't be the craziest thing happening here. Fair enough. That's her! Oh... okay. Now I get why you're pretending to be a Count. -Well, what do I do? -First off, stop acting weird and stop looking back at her! What are you, Superman? You look the same! -Oh... let's go out the back door! Ahh! Smooth... -I am so sorry. Uh... - Your Grace? - Uh... - Hi. - You look so different. -I do look different, because... I am undercover. Yes, you see, the Count cannot just go into a local pub and have a drink like everyone else. No, I have to use a disguise. Uh... this is Jensen. He is my personal security guard. He goes with me everywhere when I am... undercover. -Right. -Nice to meet you. -Oh, great to meet you. Hey, listen, I was thinking we could start the exclusive right now. -No, I don't think that's a good idea. -It's a great idea! There's a Christmas shuffleboard game back there. - Sjoelbak? - Sjoelbak! Right, that. For every point I score, I get to ask you a question. Let's go! I'll, um, see you back at the palace? -I'll make sure your bed is turned down... my liege. So that's how you've kept private for so long, huh? No one here knows who you actually are. -Uh, yes, yes. They all think I'm a local. So it's just something I do to unwind, I just put on a disguise and just, you know, go out into town. -I knew there was an explanation for those cheap clothes and this wrinkled mess... it's a disguise. Woo! -Good to know how much appearances mean to you. -Well, no, it's just I was making an observation on attire I've never seen a royal wear. Aw... oh! - Okay, again. Oh! - Oh! - Ah! Now... - Okay. - Now, now, now, watch. - Yeah. -Now, don't aim for the first one, aim for the second one, because once you get a set, you double the score. Yeah, yeah, yeah. Oh! -Or you could do that. - Yeah! - Wow. Uh, are you sure you've never played this game before? -I have beginner's luck. It's really interesting, you know, this morning, you were so stiff. Up until I mentioned Christmas. But here, you just seem more regular. -Oh, is, um... regular a good thing or a bad thing? -Well, it depends. -Depends on what? -On what kind of Count you want to be. Oh... -I... want to be the kind of Count that beats you at Sjoelbak. -Mm-hm? Good luck! Ha-ha! -Ooh! Hardly recognized you without your glasses on. -Oh... funny. You're funny. So, what's in the bag? -Right, well, are you ready for your first official Royal Sorhagen Christmas tradition? -Yes, I'm ready. -Ta-da! -Oh, it's a gnome! -Uh, no, it's a Nisse. Totally different. -Oh. -It's a mythological creature that symbolizes the Nordic Winter Solstice. And we, um, hide them all over the grounds so that children can find them and win prizes. - Ah. So an Easter Egg Hunt with gnomes? -Oh. I wasn't aware that humour is what you were gnome for. Good one! -Well, this was my favourite Christmas tradition as a child. Yeah, my parents used to bring me here every year. -Well, yeah, didn't you grow up here? -Oh, yes. No, I meant that I also got to participate. -Oh, okay. Are you close with the rest of your family? Like Lord Limburg, who's technically both your father's first cousin and your mother's fourth cousin twice removed, but the only living relative on your maternal side? -Wait a minute... You know all that, but you don't know what Nisse are? -Well, my mother was a history professor. Royal bloodlines fascinated us. -Oh! You must really love what you do, working in such a prestigious and historical publication. -Well, I'm good at it, but being good at something doesn't necessarily mean you're passionate about it. -Huh! Well, at least you're not still trying to figure out your direction in life. I don't even know where to focus my endeavours, let alone know what I'm good at. -Well, must be nice being able to figure out your passion without any monetary consequences. -You do know that money can't buy you happiness, right? -Ha! Says the Count in a million-dollar palace. - Huh. - What? No, it's just... - good to know what you see when you look at me. Be sure to check the Christmas Trees! Slow down! There'll be plenty of treats to go around! -Nothing like children enjoying the true meaning of Christmas. -Uh, is that what you'd call it? -I'm Jensen. -Yeah, I know. You work security. I'm Kirsten. I just started a few weeks ago. - You're doing great. - Oh! -Just from the tours I hear walking by. Not that I eavesdrop, I just enjoy it. The, uh, the tours, that is. Not you walking by. -Right. -Um, do you need help handing those out? -Oh, um, yeah, that'd be great. Actually, I've had to pee for like a half-hour. Come in? Good morning. Your breakfast, sir. Oh, I could get used to this. -Don't. Your Grace... Miss Collins... Welcome to the Yuletide Ball Planning Committee meeting. Ready? Right. We have the royal crystal coming in on the 22nd. -And the pheasants will arrive on the 23rd to give the King's chefs enough time to brine them properly. -Ah, there's been a candle shortage in the capital factories. We'll have to ship some in from the Newhaven Castle. But we have a candlemaker here in town. Why not ask him to make them? -Uh, because, Your Grace, the Yuletide Ball has been done exactly the same way for over a hundred years. It's about regality. -Hmm. I never realized that everything was imported for the ball. We have amazing craftsmen and chefs here in Sorhagen; wouldn't it be better for the community if we hired them? Count Lars! Of course you knew that! Tradition is what the Yuletide Ball celebrates. The guests are nobles and dignitaries from all over the world. Not to interrupt... Um, technically the Yuletide Ball exists because of the pagan holiday Yule, which was implemented to lift the spirits of the local farmer after the harvest as the days got shorter and colder. So it's always been about the people. -Hmm! -Right, so honouring its history would mean honouring this community. Yes! See? It would make more sense to open up the ball to everyone, not just the nobles. -Absolutely not. -There is a royal standard of conduct... And rules for the ball. Unless you want to take it up with your uncle... The King of Nordin? -No. No, I just thought it was worthwhile suggesting. But I guess... tradition wins. -You're the Count, and you let them shoot down your ideas? -Well, they are the royal advisors. I have to respect their advising. -Yeah, but it was such a good idea. -Ah, well, it appears they don't like good ideas. In the grand scheme of history, who am I to change things? But I do appreciate the support of a passionate historian, though, so thank you. -It was actually nice being able to flex those muscles again. -Oh? Hmm. -And since you brought it up, this historian was hoping since we're in the East Wing, maybe I could have a look at the Royal Tannenbaum? -The... uh...? -You know, the family Christmas tree? It has, like, the jewelled star gifted to the Count of Sorhagen in 1848 after the Treaty of Borg...? -Uh, yes! - Yeah! - Of course, yes. That one. I... Follow me. -Isn't that west? -Yes. Wow, it's stunning! -It really is, isn't it? Huh! -Look... the ruby red heart! This was given to Countess Freya by Count Odin on their wedding day. Can you imagine? Your great-great- great-grandparents finding love despite coming from different kingdoms? This is worth a fortune! - Really? - Yeah! - Is it? Hmm! - Oh. You must know about some of these. -Yeah, no, they sort of all get jumbled up. I'm actually more impressed with how much you know about everything. -That's thanks to my mother. I grew up with her telling me bedtime stories about the real kings and queens of Europe. She always said that real history was so much more interesting, and she was right. She would have loved this place. Ah... yeah, Christmas was her favourite holiday, and it just hasn't really been the same since she passed. -I'm sure she would be very proud of you. -Hmm. Yeah, I don't know, trying to write clickbait about royal families is a lot different than studying them. -Clickbait? Come on, give yourself a bit more credit. Your publication is more prestigious than that. Um... Look, Your Grace, I... -No, no, please. I understand. I lost my father. -Yeah. That must have been so hard, going through that with the whole world watching. -Yes, yes. No, it was. I just... I just meant that Christmas isn't the same without them, is it? Hello? -So, spill the beans! I haven't heard from you! -Well, I've been kind of busy getting the biggest exclusive RGE could ever imagine. -Amazing! -You know, the information I'm getting is illuminating. Everything we thought he was, it's the complete opposite. -Great. Love to hear it. Now, as you know, visuals are everything, right? Not that I think you would, but you could be making the whole thing up, so we need to release some photos, get some proof going. -Um, you know... Okay, it's all about building trust with him and the firm, and right now that is still off the table. -We're not in the trust business, we're in the gossip business! -Yeah. - And as of late, you've been the queen of that, so let's keep that up, yeah? -You know, I don't really think of this as gossip. It's more us reporting very specific news. -Well, you know, my motto is "Like apples and pears, the juicier the better," yeah? -Great motto. -I need a picture! -Alright, I'm on it. I'm glad to see you've made yourself at home. -Mmm! The kitchen staff have been very accommodating. You fancy a taste? -No, thank you. We need to talk about what you tried to do at yesterday's meeting. -Quick question first. If I had been the real Count and suggested using local resources, would you have turned down my idea? -He would never have tried to impose on royal tradition. -Hmm, didn't the Count choose love over royal tradition? -Look, I know that all of this is temporary, but Charlotte has made me curious. So I requested a list of all the things being imported for the ball, and everything from crystal stemware to glogg can and could come from local businesses here in Sorhagen. Why do you care so much? -Being away for so long, I hadn't realized how tough things had gotten for local businesses here. I was just looking for ways to help. But you're right, I'm not the real Count... let alone an economist. I was raised never to ruffle feathers. My father was the advisor to the Count before Charles and his father before him. Tradition is all I know. For my entire life, it's been my responsibility to uphold this legacy. -Sounds suffocating. Where are you going now? -Well, I promised Charlotte that I would take her to the Wreath Lighting in the town square. -It's not good to go into town with her. Too much could go wrong. -Don't worry, Gus. I have a foolproof plan. She thinks that this is the disguise... not this. It's okay to ruffle a few feathers once in a while. Actually, it's quite fun. -You're slouching! It's so beautiful. When I was little, my mom and I used to make dioramas of medieval towns out of clay. This place reminds me of them. -So you're saying that Sorhagen is stuck in medieval times? -Yeah, but in a good way, with the bonus of electricity and indoor plumbing. -I have missed this place. The town square, I mean. I don't get to come here that often. -Oh. I have missed going all out for Christmas. For so long, it was just a day that reminded me of my mom, which always made me so sad. -And now? -And now, I can see her loving all this, whispering to me about the great debate on the origin of wreaths, and whether they're based on Greco-Roman coronas or whether their existence didn't come into fruition until after Christianity as a symbol of never-ending life. -Well, you're welcome to whisper all of that to me. -Mm? -Well, I mean, your eyes get this special sparkle in them when you go all historical. It's really rather lovely. Hmm! Historical Society. Uh, give me one second. I'll be right back. -Mm-hm. What's that? -Oh, it's a brochure from the Historical Society. I actually didn't realize that Nordin University had a history doctorate program. -Huh! Is that something that you'd be interested in? -Yeah. You know, being here has made me realize, like, I don't know if I really want to report on royals for my livelihood. -Mm-hm, has spending time with me really been that bad that you want to give up your career? -No, no, it's just being here has ignited passions I had forgotten about. I don't know. What about you? You know, all those people tonight, I bet they would have loved to have known their Count was amongst them. - Ah... - Maybe it's time to go public? -But no, I just... well, I don't think that it's really the right time. -Well, when is the right time? What are you afraid of? -Letting people down. -Not possible. - I... we should... - Yeah. - Yeah, probably go. - Okay. -I don't want to upset Sir Gustus. - Yeah. - He might blow a gasket. -Okay. Well, thank you for tonight. Goodnight, Your Grace. -Goodnight. I don't know how this happened. -I'll tell you how it happened. Miss Collins isn't as trustworthy as we thought. Legal action will have to be taken! -No, no, no, but see, she couldn't have taken that picture. She had just gone inside that door. -Perhaps she isn't working alone? Either way, the ruse is surely over. The Royal Family will have to come clean. -But this was supposed to be a temporary fix, anyway, right? Maybe the truth can come out now. I mean, perhaps this is a good thing. -Don't do anything until I speak to the council. Why didn't you tell me the guy I've been seeing you around with is the Count?! -Uh... Good morning! Trina here makes the absolute best eyeball-skeevers. You simply have to try one. - Oh! - This is Tony. He's also a journalist. He's from Royal Gossip Entertainment. -Yes, and I just found out that you work for the Monarch Insider? -Well... Prestigious. I'm jealous! -Can I speak to you privately for a second? -Uh, sure! -What are you doing here? What's with the picture? -I just came to help. I figured you could use the big guns. -Help? Help? No, I don't need your help. This violates the agreement I signed! -No, no, no, no. There's nothing in your contract that says your editor can't fly in and snap one little photo. Now, I do hope that you're just pretending to work for the Monarch Insider and not actually thinking of jumping ship. -I said that because I wanted the Count to think I was legitimate. Ouch! But clever. -Oh, what if he thinks I've led you to him? Which, let's be honest, I kinda did. -Come on, you didn't take the photo! And perhaps now with his anonymity gone, he'll be more inclined to give you more intel. -Oh! -Now, I really do have to get back and get more of those eyeball-skizfers. They really are to die for. -It's pronounced aeble-skiva! I think... Ugh! I need you both to know that I had nothing to do with that photo being leaked. -How can we be sure? Well, the article was leaked by one of those, uh, tabloid sites. I mean, Charlotte does work for Monarch Insider. -Yeah. Someone from RGE, they found out about the exclusive and followed me here. I'm so sorry. I just... I know you weren't ready to be a public Count yet, and... -Oh, it's okay, um... Don't think I was ever ready to be any type of Count. -Can I still finish the article? Your Grace. Your uncle, the King, is on the phone demanding to speak to you at once. Address him properly, let him guide the topic of conversation... -And make sure to enunciate! I'm sure he'll call the whole thing off; it's the sensible thing to do. And stand up straight, for God's sake! -It's a phone call! He can't see me. -Ah-ah! -Your Uncle... Highness? -Mr. Pederson, this has gotten out of control. -Oh, I agree. I never meant for this to go so far and... -My royal advisors, the Queen, we're all very concerned. Mr. Pederson, this is disastrous. -Why don't we tell everyone the truth? -Absolutely not! That would ruin Sorhagen, our entire country! -Fine, then... I'll make a public statement as the Count. -A formal introduction would be best. We will invite the royal press to a Julebord hosted by you tomorrow night at the palace. -I'll agree to that... if my mother can cater the desserts. She does makes an award-winning krumkake. -Do as you please. The Queen and I will see you tomorrow night. -So... how bad is it? -Well, I am now hosting a Julebord tomorrow night, for the King, Queen, and the royal press. -You are? -Yes. I would love it if you could attend. For support. And while there will be other press there, you will still be the only one doing an exclusive on Christmas with the Count. -Ah, thank you! Thank you! It's such an honour. -Look, I do know that it wasn't your fault that my photo got out. -Mm-hm. -I know that I really can trust you. -Yeah. -Um... What are you doing tomorrow morning? -Why? I doubt she'd recognize you in any of those photos. -Can't take any chances. -Darling, I'm worried about you. This is all getting... - Out of hand? Oh, I'm well aware. All because of a little white lie, I could bring ruin to this town, the Royal Family, and everything that you have worked so hard for. -Well, that's a lot of pressure to put on yourself, especially for someone who's been running from this place for so long. -Mum, I haven't been running from here. -Really? So, what would you call constantly travelling for ten years, avoiding all responsibility? -Looking for my passion. Trying to find a job that I'm good at and that I can make a difference with. Oh, let's just hope that I can still make a positive impact before I leave again. Oh, here we go! -Ah! Come in! You must be Charlotte. -Good morning. Are you two ready to prep for a Scandinavian feast during the Christmas season with lots of traditional food and drinks? -You had to Google "Julebord," didn't you? -I had to lightly refresh my knowledge. -The Count tells me he wants you to cover the making of the krumkake. And since being royal doesn't get you out of helping, both of you can grab an apron. I have to admit I'm really not the baking type. You know, my mom and I used to make Christmas cookies, but they were always from a box. -Krumkake is a classic. Crispy wafers rolled into cones with cream and chocolate. The key is to beat the butter and sugar first, then gradually add the eggs. -Okay. Oh, uh... -Ooh, you are really not good at this. -Oh, and pointing it out really helps my confidence... What... hmm! Why are you so good at this? -Well, you know, grew up practicing. -Oh, they have baking classes at boarding school? -Yeah, something like that. -Oh. Wow, look at you. The Count of many talents. Oh, you have no idea. Always refer to them as "Your Majesty." Do not commence eating until he commences eating. Do not finish until the King finishes. -What if he eats faster than I do? -You will finish when he finishes. How in the world did we get here? You ready? -Ready as I'll ever be. Your Majesties. -Good to see you, Nephew. Good to see you, indeed. -Although we respected and understood our nephew's desire to remain anonymous as a way to excel in his charitable endeavours, we must admit we are relieved and overjoyed that he has now become a public figure. Since your photograph was released, we've had more nobles and dignitaries purchasing tickets the last 48 hours than in the last four Yuletide balls. -Wonderful for the nobles. Well, if it's ticket sales that you're really concerned about, what don't we open the Yuletide Ball up to the public? -I beg your pardon? -I learned from an historian that the original Yuletide was a celebration to raise the spirits of the community during the long, dark winter. It was something for everyone to rally around and look forward to. Think how tourism would soar if we invited everyone to the Yuletide Ball. -That is a... unique idea. -Perhaps we can discuss this after the Julebord. In private. I apologize if I overstepped tonight. -When my brother fell ill, I had a meeting with Lars, my real nephew, about what it would mean to him to become the next Count. Before I could get a word out, he told me he wasn't interested in being Count. He was in love, and wanted to have a nice, quiet life with a random American woman. -Not random to him, dear. -Nevertheless, I was appalled. I pleaded with him. But alas, for some, love, more powerful than country. - So I've heard. - Hmm! Since I only have a daughter, who of course one day will become Queen, there are no other current heirs or relatives to bestow the imperative title upon. There has been a Count here for centuries. That is why, Mr. Pederson, we need you to continue to be Count, until a better solution presents itself. After all, now that you're in the public, our hands our tied. -Uh... I want to help all I can, but, well, I've already done... exactly what we agreed upon for the interview. -But you must continue. -But I'm leaving the first of the year. I have a new job. -Will you at least host the Yuletide Ball? Be front and centre, so we can stretch the publicity as long as possible? -I will. Yes. I will be the host extraordinaire. -If you open up the ball to everyone. And there are a few local vendors that I suggest we hire. -Very well. So, tell me everything! What was the food like? What were the King and Queen like? -Okay, so the King and Queen were very proper. The food was delicious. I ate so much. But the best part was the Count opened up the Yuletide Ball to the public! - He what? - Yes! -That Count of yours is pretty great. -Oh, he's not... he's not mine. -Not yet. -I can't believe how busy it is! -I know! Ever since that picture came out, reservations have been up. I am so glad that the Count decided to go public! Oh, I don't think I dressed warmly enough for this. - Wear my scarf. - Oh! - That'll keep you warm. - Thank you. - It suits you. - Mm... It's breathtaking. -Yes. -Did you know the first reference of the northern lights were from cave paintings 30,000 years ago? -I did not. -Hmm. Well, now you do. -Do you know that you can't always see them? But I had a feeling they'd be out tonight. My father used to bring me here every winter. To me, this is Christmas. You know, it's funny, I... thought I was coming out here to get an interview with the Count, and instead I got the best Christmas I've ever had. Me, too. There you are! - Oh, I was just, um... - Yeah. - Showing Charlotte the view. - Mm-hm. -Ah, yeah. Well, Sir Gustus sent me. I've been given direct instructions to see Charlotte back to the B&B. You know how Gustus gets when that vein in his neck sort of... pops? -Oh, yes. Yes, we wouldn't want that. Oh, no. Yeah... I should get going. Yeah, the last thing I'd want is for him to ban me from doing the exclusive, so... yeah. Goodnight, Charlotte. -Goodnight, Count Lars. Thank you for tonight. Miss Charlotte... Do you think Kirsten has a date to the ball this year? It's Adam... actually. - Hi! - Charlotte! What can I get for you? -Well, the Count invited me to Little Christmas Eve Dinner tonight. -Ooh! -Which Kirsten thankfully informed me means the night before Christmas Eve and not something to do with little, small foods. He's lucky to have your company. - Aww! - Enjoy. -So, I was, um... I was hoping to bring a dessert. I just don't know what it should be. -Oh! I have just the thing. Risgrynsgröt... with raspberries and a touch of cinnamon. -Hmm! -It's one of his favourites. -How would you know that? -I meant more it's everyone's favourite. -Well, if you think he'll like it, I'm in. -You care for him, don't you? -Is it that obvious? -And what is it about him you admire most? -That's sort of a strange question. -I'm just curious. -Well, um... he's just not really what I thought a Count would be like. You know, it's funny, there's actually not much regality to him. He's, uh... he's kind, and he's adventurous, and... And he's kind of a dork. -I'll go grab you those bowls. -Thank you! -OMG! Do you have a thing for the Count? -Tony, do you just lurk around every corner? - It's part of the job. - Okay, it's kinda not. -He's kinda cute, hmm? I could see how one would fall. But this isn't gonna interfere with your write-up, right? I mean, we're looking for juice, not lovestruck admiration. -Tony, I've really been thinking about this, and these articles we write, we treat these people like they only exist for our amusement. - Mm-hm. - And their mistakes and misfortunates are a good thing. But these are people, okay? And they're doing their best. -Yes, but they are royals, and we're not and never will be. And people like us, we just like to peek behind the curtain. -Okay. -So worry a little bit less about them, and get me what you have so far. -Fine, I'll email you a copy. But I'm just warning you, it's taken on more of a wholehearted tone. -Oh, darling. That sounds horrible! -You know, at first, I thought Little Christmas Eve was another thing having to do with those Nisse. You know, because of the "little" part. -Ah. No. But well done for, uh, trying to use the proper name. -Hmm. Well, speaking of proper names, I have a surprise for dessert... Rayna's risgrynsgröt! How'd I do? -Very... Yes, very good. - Thank you. - Well done, uh... Do you know that this is my favourite? -Mm-hm! I heard. -Did Rayna tell you what's so special about it? -Hmm, that it's a fancy name for rice pudding? - No... - Hmm? -In every few bowls, there's a hidden almond. -Oh! -Mm-hm, and whoever finds the almond in their bowl wins a prize. -Wow, there's lots of prizes in your Christmas traditions. -Yeah. We call it, uh, Christmas motivation. -Hmm. -In fact, um, you've, um... you've motivated me. - Yeah? - Yeah. Finding a way to invite the community into the Yuletide Ball has... given me a new sense of purpose. I've not felt like that before. And if you hadn't come here, none of it would have happened, so... Thank you. -Hmm! - Mm! - Mm-hm? -I got the almond! - No. - Okay, I... - You got it? - I got the almond! - Are you okay? - I'm okay. I just want my prize. -The truth? -What? -Um... There's something that I need to tell you. Get her out of here at once! Excuse me? What... What? Sorry. What's got into you? -See for yourself. RGE? But I thought you worked for Monarch Insider. -Okay, I can explain. -No need to explain! She's a fraud. A tabloid gossip columnist. She tricked us. Get out of here, now! -Look, I only said that I worked for them so that you would see me as credible. -"Falling for the Count"? So this was all for tabloid gossip? No, it... -Get out! Go! -Okay. Okay, I'm going. -You lied to me? -I'm so sorry. Why did you change my article? -It just didn't have the pop that RGE is known for... no scandal, no gossip. I mean, quite frankly, it was kind of boring. But then I realized that the situation itself is the story. -What? You didn't think to run this by me? Well, I'm your boss. -I quit. -What? Wait, wait, wait... Don't be hasty! Look, you were a little bit off your game this time, but you're quite good at this! Don't give it up. -I don't want to be good at this. -Well, what about your raise or your apartment? Not to mention your visa. -You know, I'd rather find a different path than work for a publication that lacks integrity. Never did work for Monarch Insider. -I'm so sorry. I didn't see that coming. -I can't believe she would do that. -To be fair, you did lie to her, too. -I know, it's just if I... were the real Count of Sorhagen, then, well... I'd feel hurt... and betrayed. -But you're not. -No. No, I am just some random bloke who fell for a girl who clearly just wanted to meet a Count to sell papers. -Look, both of you have fallen for someone who isn't the real person. It's not like it would have worked out, anyway. Besides, you're leaving soon. It sounds like this might all be for the best. -You're probably right. It's just I've never met someone that I wanted to... have around. All of the time. Talking to her about everything and nothing. It was the best part of my day. But it wasn't real. -Hmm. Whatever happens, I still think it's important that the Yuletide Ball is still a go. Now, I left a note in Kirsten's mailbox asking her to be my date. You sure you don't want these eggs, hmm? -They're all yours. Alright. -I meant to return these sooner, but things got a little crazy. -So I saw. Everyone's talking about the gossip columnist who tricked the Count. -Look, I just... I panicked and I wanted to get a good interview, so I lied about who I worked for, but that was never supposed to be my article. -So it wasn't just to get close to a Count? -Honestly, my intentions were just strictly to write about Christmas with the Count of Sorhagen. That's it. You look understaffed. Could I please offer you a hand? -If you could get some napkins from the back kitchen, that would help. -Okay, I'm on it. Where are the napkins? Ahh! He's your son, isn't he? He's not the Count. I'm sorry! Strict orders from Gustus: I can't let you in anymore. -Are you even a real security guard? - What? - He lied to me! -Your presence is no longer welcome here. -He's not the Count. I have proof. Let her through. Hey! You lied to me! You're not the Count! -Hang on. Um, why would you think that? -I gave up my career for what, a fraud? -You were the one who just assumed that I was the Count. -Oh, so this is my fault? Because there was never a time where you could have told me the truth? -Look, I did try to... also, you were the one that was pretending to be a prestigious journalist when all the time, really, you're just a, a, a... a gossip tabloidist! -At least my lie didn't involve deceiving an entire country! - Uh... - No, no! You both, you both, should be ashamed of yourselves. Please, Miss Collins, let's discuss this in my office. -No. No, I'm done. You were mad because I was a gossip tabloidist? Well, guess what? The world is about to get the best piece of gossip they've ever read... the truth! I don't want to interrupt, but there's someone waiting for you in the study. -I don't want to see him. -He said it's a matter of life or death. -Life or death? Really? -I needed to talk to you. And it might not be life or death, but there are many people's livelihoods at stake. Charlotte, if you tell everyone that there is no Count and that I was pretending to be him, this town is ruined. And it's not just the Royal Family that will hurt. It's regular people, like... like Trina, and Rayna... my mother, people whose livelihoods depend on there being a Count of Sorhagen. -But don't you think they deserve to know the truth? -Charlotte, the truth is the real Count abdicated for love. Look, when I led you to mistake me for the Count, the royal firm saw an opportunity to temporarily fix the problem. I thought that it would all just be a small fib. But then things escalated, and... I never expected to develop feelings for you. I had feelings for you, too. Had? -Had. -Hmm. Past tense? - Past tense. - Yes. Well, to be fair, neither of us were honest, were we? Well, just so you know, everything that I felt, everything that we shared... that was me. That was Adam Pederson, not the Count of Sorhagen. -How can that matter when it was all built on a lie? Then I have to ask you, did you like me just because you thought that I was the Count? You need to leave. -Charlotte, please. Don't write that story! Should we cancel the ball? If she writes a story about the Count being a fake, we're all done for. -Adam... what do you think we should do? -Well, I understand the consequences and how disastrous this will be for everyone. Until the truth is out there, I think we carry on as-is. The ball should go ahead; the community is looking forward to it. -I agree with Adam. I brought you some cocoa. Thanks. -Why didn't you just tell us that you worked for RGE from the start? -I knew the reputation the site had, and I was embarrassed. Part of me always has been. You know, I, uh, I did it for the visa, and... I got carried away. I just never had to face who I was hurting. -Well, it all sort of worked out. I mean, look at all the people visiting, thanks to you. Also, I found some dresses that you might like for the Yuletide Ball. -You know, I think I'm gonna sit this one out. There's just... a lot I need to figure out. -Well, I don't know exactly what happened between the two of you, but being a history buff, attending a centuries-old Christmas ball in an actual palace is not something to skip out on. The King and Queen have arrived. They've requested your company. You alright? -Yes. No, I'm just... taking it all in. -For what it's worth, I'm glad you ruffled feathers and opened up this place for all. -Really? Mr. Tradition? You sure? -Perhaps you've inspired me to... sometime on the rarest of occasions... to loosen up the rules a bit. -Gus, is this your way of telling me that you're going to miss me? Babysitting a loose cannon is not something I'm going to miss. Though you have brought an interesting energy to the palace... not entirely bad. -Well! Ladies and gentlemen... King Sven, first of his name, and Queen Anna of Nordin. I've yet to tell them that Charlotte knows who you really are. -Don't worry, Sir Gustus. You won't have to. May I? Hello, everyone. Welcome to the Yuletide Ball. My name is Adam Pederson. I am not the Count of Sorhagen. I have been pretending to be the Count because the real Count abdicated. I led a journalist to believe that I was him, and then I maintained the ruse, at first for fun and then, for what I thought was for the good of Sorhagen. But it, um, clearly got out of hand. You see, the real Lars, he traded royalty for love. And I think he was right to do so. Because, you see, love is so much more important than power or status. I know this because I love this town, this community, and I want it to be the very best that it can be, which starts with me being honest with all of you. I never meant to hurt anyone, and I'm sorry if I did. So, let's raise a glass to truth, Christmas, and to all of you, the beloved people of Sorhagen. Bravo! Jolly good! Uh... I guess not! - Didn't see that coming. - What?! What are you doing here? -I couldn't miss the first ball open to the public. So... Wow, what a twist! A fake Count! Still quit? Be quite a story coming from you. -It's all yours, Tony. But you might want to get on it. It looks like everyone's already getting the word out. -Ah, bollocks! Excuse me! Yeah... Does this mean you're not leaving? -You were right, Mother, about everything. I'm staying. I want to help you with the cafe and do everything that I can to make sure Sorhagen thrives. -Ah! -These last few days, I've learned that taking on responsibility is a good thing, especially when I can make a difference. -I'm so proud of you! Oh! -Go. -I'm sorry. May I have this dance? -Yes, you may. -You look beautiful. -That was, uh, quite a speech. -I know it might have scooped your story a bit. -No, I actually decided not to write it. -Oh? -Yeah, it just... didn't really feel right, especially after seeing how much good came from having a Count in Sorhagen. -Hmm. I'm really sorry I lied to you. Although your lie was way worse. -Oh, way worse. Ish. -So if you're not going to write the story, what happens now? I hate to think that I ruined your career. -The opposite, actually. I realized that journalism isn't my passion. History is. So I'm going to follow in my mother's footsteps and apply to University of Nordin's History Doctorate. -You're going to make the best history professor in the world. -Mm! So this means you're sticking around? -I'm staying right here. -I think it would be nice to spend some time with the real Adam Pederson. - Oh? - Mm-hm! We, too, want to apologize. We have not been honest with our royal subjects, the fair people of Sorhagen, and for that we are sorry. -Adam has shown us that the true strength of a title doesn't come from its power but from what one does with that power and responsibility. -Having said that, by decree and law, for decorum and tradition, our country must have a Count of Sorhagen. -And so, we would like to bestow the honorary title onto Adam. If he would accept. -Uh... I will, if I can still be me, and not necessarily live in the palace. And not follow those insane rules. -Done. -Also date whoever I wish. -Certainly. To our Count. -To our people! To our people! Merry Christmas, honorary Count Adam. -Merry Christmas, Charlotte. Let's make it one for the history books, shall we?
