Yes, I don't say anything. It's very hot, from and on. - And a moustache, and a moustache. There was nothing to put on winter overalls. - Mate. Ha ha. Here! That's it, well done! Well, freeze for five minutes. Navigator, give me a rubber band, please. Junior Lieutenant Chervonenko! I. - To the headquarters. With the crew. - How's the weather? - Rubbish. - Steward, help. - Nu, that, martyr? Session ended. - In the range of our regiment detected strong group of fighters. - Go. - Your task is to find the Fokker aerodrome in the proposed square B15. Noted? - Noted. - Take a photo if found. This is made worse by bad weather. - What do you say, Chervonenko? - Let's joke, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel. - Run into the Fokkers - leave immediately. Cover up with clouds. We now need this data. Clear? I understood you. May I go? - Departure on readiness. Go. We transmit the order of the Supreme Commander-in-Chief. Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, may I listen to the summary? Turn up the volume. Marshal of the Soviet Union Rokossovsky. The troops of the First Belarusian Front, having crossed the rivers... - Comrade officers! Our Pinsk was taken. - Hooray! - Comrade Lieutenant! Comrade. Lieutenant, hurry up! Let's go rather, more to sort it out. - Pilot! Bachiv himself. Right? Well done! Tikay. Sobolevsky to the exit. Sobolevsky to the exit. - What? Would you like a drink? - How do you know? Eh! Eh! Eh! Where are you? We need one person here. Come on, come here, navigator. - Come here. It's starting, right? Did you think of something again? Don't forget, by the way, that you are Arkhiptsev's crew. Well, everything will be all right. Commander, what a sky! Woof woof woof! - Bugger. Well, it looks like the last one. Oops! Come on chaps. Come on, hurry up. You know what you are carrying. Don't spill. Uncle Sasha, did you bring what you promised? I have a recount. Clear? - Well! - You are free. Do it. Well, uncle Sasha? Let's. What come on? - You know what. - He he he. What idiot told you that I have vodka? Why is that an idiot? Osadchy said. Our mechanic. He himself saw how the boxes were unloaded. What did he see in the boxes? - Bottles. What's in the bottles? Don't you know what's in the bottles? - I know that. Read. Raspberry syrup. I told you right away that I don't have alcohol. - Well, Venechka, we have nothing to do here. - Ah! So old. - Elderly. - Honourable man. Yes? Reverend, yes. - Deceiving. - Deceiving. - Eh! Sutler. Yes. Heh! We got stuck with this syrup. And what shall we do? - Look, I have an idea. Ugh. - In general, yes. Do you understand? - Yes. Yes, and tell your Osadchy. let him drag the entire canister with the hydraulic mixture. Otherwise, I'll tear his head off for false information. - Understood. Uncle Sasha! Alexander Mikhailovich! - And the wine you drink in your veal age is completely wrong. I won't drink any more. - Trepach. - I'm a talker? Ten bottles of syrup and money for a barrel. - Come on. - Well, so what's the matter? Oh! - What? What? What's happened? Is it possible that under the pressure of this rubbish the chassis of such a beautiful car as our Pawn is produced? - Calm down, dear. Veniamin Borisovich, I have long wanted to ask you. Yes? - You... Wow! Have you ever drunk in civilian life? - I drank. New milk. Yes? - Yes. You see, Evgeny Sanych. - Ask. - Thank you. In all this crap... - Yes. - I'm mainly interested in the process. What are you saying! - Yes. - Well, then interfere. - Please. - Hurry, hinder, hinder. - Please. - Come on, come on. Work. - One, two, three. So so so. Stop. - What? - Let's see what we got. as a result of this process. Your Grace, please. You have the first word. Well, how? - Well well well? - A magical drink. - Yes? Go you! - Liquor. - Liquor. Oh! "Landing gear liquor". Sounds like? - Sounds. - A handle. So, did you forget anyone? - Commander, please. - What? Something else? Word. - Sergeant Major Sobolevsky has the floor. - Allow. Quiet. - Comrades! Why didn't they wake up? Oh! Wake up brother. Well, what. Will have to start over. - Come on. Comrade officers and sergeants! - So. Hah! Crushed six hundred minutes. - As always. - Move over. Well, what are you doing? This is Chervonenko glass. He's poured. Na, here. Mushrooms, hold on. Well, what can you do? - Provide. - Go. - Comrade officers and sergeants! Also foremen and generals! - Ha ha! - Today, 14 July 1944, troops of the First Belarusian Front, continuing the victorious offensive, captured the city of Pinsk. - Hooray! Home town of Junior Lieutenant Dmitry Chervonenko. Hooray! - Calm down. - For victory! - Hooray! - Call Chervonenko. - Sokol-104, Sokol-104. I am Ruby, I am Ruby. Submit the situation. How do you hear? Receive. - Quiet, quiet, quiet. - I propose to raise glasses to the creators of this wonderful drink, Landing gear liquor liqueur, my friends! My navigator. Venya, healthy. And my arrow-radio operator. Sobolevsky, healthy. Cheers. - Venya, play something. Sincere, the squadron asks. Venya, my beloved. - Venya, well, they ask you. - Eh! - Yes. - You won't find another one like it. Well, nothing chaps. - Sorry, dear. Happens. Violin, violin. Wow, the violin is over. - Give me the piano. - I'll eat heartily. Sincerely. I used to leave sometimes... - About four Ivanov. - Come on. The pilot was Ivan Ivanovich. The navigator was Ivan Stepanych. Gunner-radio operator Ivan Fomich. The mechanic was Ivan Ilyich. Ivan Ivanovich is holding the course. Ivan Stepanych keeps in touch. The battle hosted by Ivan Fomich. Ivan Ilyich is sleeping in the dug-out. Ha ha! Ivan Ivanovich is drinking cognac. Ivan Stepanych is drinking wine. Landing gear liquor liqueur... Aha! - Chervonenko crosses the start for landing. - Hey! Someone help! Mitka was killed. - Come of. - Carefully. - You see, what a story. Eh... - How is it so? How did it happen then, Pastukhov? Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, when they were performing a combat mission, they were attacked by fighters. They tried to leave. - Photographed? - Yes sir! Venya, bring you something to eat, eh? I'll wait chaps. - I can feed you alone. - Thank you, Kate. Well, Katya, she doesn't eat anything. What are you? Eat! I'll bring a compote. - They bought it. At a fake aerodrome. Now they have developed the film, but there is no aerodrome there. Linden. Layout. Yes, you will eat. Eat. - The shepherd reported, they went as usual. Fog, filth. Matched the weather. And behind the front line suddenly the sun in the eyes and the Fokkers. Where did they come from? We went to the tail. Well, in general... Mitka barely reached us. And the Shepherd already planted. Yes, well enough, Vasya, indeed. Let's go from here. - There's just one thing I can't understand. Well, if things have changed, what the hell are they did you follow the old route? - Chaps, sit down for one. table, otherwise we are closed. - Yes, by the way, why, he says, I need petrol, when I sit on the same temperament. And here's another great anecdote. Listen. - Then you tell me about it. - Yes? - Yes. - Katya, you forgot the compote. Eh! Katenka, I'm sorry. We were late, the authorities delayed us. Tea, compote? - I'd like some tea, please. - I'm sorry, I say. We are late. The authorities delayed us, I say. Katya, huh? Well? - Get away from me. - Oh, well. With who will you fly now, chaps? Give me a match. I'll give you a match now! - Quiet. Quiet, Vasya. Calmly. Let's go sleep. Calmly. I understand everything, I'm not stupid. I won't interfere? Sit down. You'll interfere. - Katya, there are four of us. - No wonder you're upset, chaps. War. Give me a match. Arkhiptsev! Your navigator is clearly making progress. Quiet, quiet, but right there. Well, where are we before him, grey horses. He is an artist. By the way, Venechka, trust me. Useless chores. I know this Katya. You're not the first, you're not the last... Are you a lieutenant? What's the matter with you, Comrade Captain. What do you want? It's all your bastards. - What? - Think angels. Three for one. There will be a report at headquarters today. - You're lying, you son of a bitch. I screwed something up myself. - May I go? - Go. - Venya! Get up, Venya! Venya! Venya! By the way, I'm telling you... for the last time, I tell you. Do you know how much it costs play the violin? Eat bread. You don't know this, of course. But, but I know. Grandpa, that's enough. What, grandpa? Grandfather. Enough talk, enough. Come on, get dressed. And come on, hurry up, let's go to school. Take small change. Take a change, you will have breakfast there at the big break. Take care of the Violin. Hold it. That's it. And don't lose Tchaikovsky. Now come on, run faster, or you'll be late. Wait, Venya. Benjamin! - Venya, finish your music. You interfere with sleep. Commander, do you want to admire your falcons? No need. I see them that way. They bored me like that. Scoundrels must be judged. - Look how bloodthirsty. So directly and judge. It is against the law to plant them on the lip. This is our pedagogical liberty. - Good liberty. - Yesterday, you know, they had a fight in the dining room. The swill was invented. The car was stolen. Well, they got the car back. Purchased and returned. - And why all this? - Why? Very literate. Well, Mikhalych, you're just like in a tram. Competent. I put on a hat. - Yes. - Do you know why that is? - Well? - From the weather. No flights... Boys have nowhere to put their energy. Here's your car, here's your liquor. - Yes. By the way, how is it, "Landing gear liquor" or what? Eh! Interesting ear! And you, play, play. Why are you sitting there? Come on, pump out all the hydraulic mixture from the plane, and drive the moonshine. Or, get out, better punch someone in the face. Vaughn, Semochka, for example. - Compared. How much for me, how much for them. They are boys. They are twenty years old. And this victim of yours didn't mess anything up there? That's what I believe in him. - I sometimes want to throw something away even purer than this liquor. - In-in-in. - You know, it's military time. Guardhouses as we don't have one. So, don't bother. - Well, here we are at home. - This is the sergeant's cell. - Well, what. Thank you. - And this is an officer's. - Nothing to the room. - Pretty decent. In my opinion, too. Quite decent. Yes. Are there any claims? Eat. Yes? - Comrade Major! - Yes. You know that according to the charter, officers are subject to house arrest only. - And you know what to plant, we are not supposed to. Comrade Major! May I clarify? Yes, please clarify. - Comrade Major, is it necessary to put the sergeant next to the officers? Isn't this a gross violation of the charter, Comrade Major? After all, if I were less disciplined, I could, on occasion, say Arkhiptsev: "Come on, Commander. Have you forgotten how we were sitting on the lip together?" Or to the navigator, Comrade Lieutenant. Is that right, Comrade Major? - Is it supposed to be disgraceful? Fight, you know. Drive Landing gear liquor liquor. No, you still got off well. Only three days. - Three days? Why are we talking for so long? Yes. So go to your cells without talking. And Arkhiptsev to me. I hear you, Comrade Major! Do you remember how much per litre of mixture goes? Syrup. - I don't remember, Comrade Major. - Kuzmich! I wish you good health, Comrade Lieutenant Colonel! Hello, Kuzmich! Do you regret leaving my car? I don't regret it. - Then, hold on. - Don't you regret it? - I'm sorry - May I? - Take me to the weather station. - Well, how are you? Crew? - Home-made. - A... Woke up after the funeral? - Live, cry. - They babysit the little one. Before, everyone was screwed. That daughter-in-law will jump on mine. That's mine for the bride. Well, as the son died, there was nothing to share. What about you? - Zaharin! Head of Communications in fifteen minutes to the headquarters! - I'm listening. And I, Kuzmich, have no changes. Well, how are your boys? What boys? - Well, your crew. Boys are like boys. No worse than others. What are busy? - How than? They sit on the lips. - I'm sitting... behind bars, in a damp dungeon... Captive-bred young eagle My sad comrade, waving his wing, pecks bloody food under the window. - Oh, brothers! Now something pecking would not be a sin. - Well, how are they? - Now they will survive. - Ha ha! - Send something? - Not really. - Dutik! Dutik! On! - You know, brothers, when I first longing for officer epaulettes? At the financial part. - On pay day. During the distribution of chrome boots. You are gross materialists. A sharp longing for the officer rank seized me yesterday in the dining room. Uh, I'd punch that bastard between the eyes. - Well, you know. Thank God for that. You didn't get up yesterday. Otherwise, at one point they would have filed the case with a tribunal. By the way, you also climbed completely in vain. - Why? Yes, because it's my own business. - My God! Navigator, you provincial, holy blockhead. Your business is our business. Understood, unfortunate intellectual? - Have you eaten, Whisk? - OK then. Fine. I'm sitting for a specific slap that I gave out to this whip. There you are, for kicking him out of the cafeteria. - Well, what is this one sitting for? - My dear, and this one is sitting behind past transgressions against the charter. And for possible sins in the future. And for the moral readiness to beat every scoundrel in the face who speaks vilely about a woman. Understood? - Less than thirty people in the application excursions are accepted. - Got it. Ha ha ha. What organisation is the tour from? Vasily Ostrovsky. Carrier Cooperative. - Who is here from the cabbies' cooperative? You? - Hello! I'm from the cooperative. - Well, then, since you are all assembled, I beg you, comrade cabbies. - Sobolevsky! To borscht! - Thank you, breadwinner! - Well, what did you think, strategists? - And yet, in my opinion, the Fokkers don't operate from the main aerodrome. And from the aerodrome in ambush. They cleverly disguise their main aerodrome, and somewhere nearby they staged a false one, on which... Chervonenko and ran into. - Eh! Ivan Alekseevich, I think it is necessary organise reconnaissance of the whole squadron. Divide the flight area into squares. And let them, under the cover of fighters, comb their areas. And then they sent one Chervonenko... and, please. Alekseevich, the major is right. All this is true. You don't count one. Not all crews are prepared for reconnaissance. Yes, even in this weather. - Oh! You can't see shit. - That's it. No, we need to send one crew again. One has been looking for. - Yes, I was looking. I am nothing I can say about Chervonenko. He was a real pilot. Courageous, tenacious. You know what kind of whales are sitting there. You can see it in handwriting. - Yes, it is true. - Eh! Not here? - You need to look for the head. There's a bridge here, right? Here is the unloader. - Yes. Here... the junction of the seventeenth kilometre. - Kilometre. - Well, let it be a kilometre. Here is the village of the Lutetian commune. - So they caught Mitka right here, right? Now the question is where these Fokkers come from. Listen chaps. Or maybe they dispersed the group into small areas? And they peck us from around the corner, but from under the side. So you think that in general no main aerodrome? - Eat. - Where? - In my opinion, Arkhiptsev should fly. - Well, why still Arkhiptsev, huh? Ivan Alekseevich! Well, please explain, huh? Well, admit you have a soft spot for this crew. - I don't have any weakness. Drop it, drop it He even gave his Kuzmich to them. Gave. - Here you go. - Mikhalych, listen, maybe we really in vain find fault with them, huh? Excellent crew. A thinking pilot, a knowledgeable navigator, and a radio operator... radio operator - God forbid everyone! OK OK. You flew together, so you sing one song. That's for sure. We are one crew. And you are our crew, only you did not understand it. - Can you add some hot water? Not really. Thank you, Katenka. Here, splash the chief of staff, hotter. That's right, Ivan Alekseevich. Something I can't figure out here. Thank you. People sit on the lip, and you, you know... - Well, then, give the command to be released. - Didn't understand. - The experiment is over. Understood? The very fact of arrest is a powerful tool. In short, I need these chaps. And, in my opinion, intelligence confuses something. There can be no German aerodrome in this square. - Why? Well, do you remember the station we bombed? - Well? - They reappeared with fuel tanks. For whom? Why am I asking you? - For tanks, for motorised infantry. - And if for the Fokkers? - Here. Understand. Probably their main aerodrome located somewhere near the station. Because transporting fuel over a long distance would immediately catch your eye. Right? - Yes. - So, the chief of staff just said, that intelligence spotted Fokker over there. - So what? So what? It may be also a false aerodrome. Like at Mitkin. - You, here, take the duration of a Fokker flight. Set aside time for take-off and landing. Now cut it all in half. Divided? - Well? - Oh well? Did you make sure they can't get us out of there? Savelia still has a primary school teacher. Why in half? - Because going there and coming back, ignoramus. Well, let's say they're based near the station. - Well? Well, then by all accounts, they also lack range. Here you have a navigator. They just explained to you that they can operate from the aerodrome in an ambush. And this greatly increases their radius. Sat down, ate, flew on. - So what..., one wonders, should we look for this aerodrome the devil knows where? - Zhenya! A? - B! - We were sent to find. - He cleaned the horse with a scraper, and he grumbled, angry beyond measure. - Quietly! - Comrade Senior Lieutenant, the plane is ready to fly. Technician-lieutenant Kuzmichev reports. - At ease. - At ease. So. Is the tank full? - Yes sir! - Ammunition? Fine. - Yes. Thank you Kuzmich. Did you know we're on a mission? - Well, I knew. Wow! How do you know everything, Kuzmich? - Take care! Well, how do you know everything? - And when you were chilling on your lip... Yes. - I was ordered prepare the aeroplane for flight. Hey, Kuzmich. You are a boring, primitive man. - What? What, what? Yes, I'm not interested in you. You know everything, you are not surprised at anything. By the way, I, as a gunner-radio operator, here of this twin-engine aircraft is obliged... - You are not a gunner-radio operator, but a talker. And you have to sit on the plane for a long time. - How? - Come on, Zhenya. Come on, don't make a mistake. - You will be a gunner-radio operator, and a pilot in your soul... You will fly with a whistle, backwards. Tam-taratam, taratam pam-pam, tam-taratam, taratam. Tam-taratam... - Whip. Come on, get out of here. We will roll now. We'll be there in forty seconds, above the reference point. - Somewhere here Mitka bought himself. Eat! - What is there? - Hay. Yes, it's a disguise. Ah, what to guess. Come on, let's test them out. Attack! - Hmm. It is clear that the linden. One prop. Commander, where did we dive? They provoked. Need a disguise. Navigator! We must look at the station where they thought. - Why the hell did you have to provoke the hay? No, brothers, you are not pilots. You are a cooperative of cabbies. Attention! On the left, behind Fokkers! Bastard! Commander, take a little to the right, I can't see him well. - Good. Good, good. Good! Left Fokker! Sergei, you have to leave. Now we will arrange a circus for them. Attention! Sit down everyone. Don't shoot. We are down. Got it? Navigator! Well! - Gone. - Ha ha! Indeed, a circus. Phew! Speaking between us girls, I said goodbye to you a long time ago. Phew! - Well, how flat? - Let's find some. Well, where did the Fokkers come from? - From the ambush aerodrome. That's it, son. Don't argue with elders. - Eugene! Tell me, we're going home. We are going home. - Uncle Seryozha, are you going to fly today? No. The club is closed today. What will you do at home? Check notebooks. And what did you put to our Mishka? Mediocre. - Is that good? So-so. - Well, Mishka's mother will give it. - Konstantin. And Konstantin? Kostya. Go. Would you be home for landing, eh? - For what? Well, what, so all the time and will fly? So I will. - Ah... uh... You're out of gas. - Well, let it end. - Ha ha! Let be. You can't fly without petrol. - No, you can. - No, you cannot. No, you can. - No, you cannot. It's impossible for you, but it's possible for me. - Commander, the fuel is at the limit. Hot on the edge! - Well, let it go to the limit. - Comrade Lieutenant Technician, can one smoke a cigarette? Thank you. Thank you. Pislya resentment required to smoke. Every day barley, barley, barley through the winter; they choked with millet, cabbage in the spring... - Well, you are quiet. - How to serve you cabbage with water on the pepper, and on the other cabbage without water, and on a third water without cabbage, so you will dream at night. And now barley on us... - Shut up! - They're coming. Went to meet. - Well, Kuzmich, did you miss it? How are you - like me? And what happened? - What's happened... I'll tell you later. Come here. Anything with the motors? Not really. The motors are fine. - The wing is worn out. Will have to darn. - Nice job, darn it. It's easier to do something new. Why is it you so? Fokkers. - Ah... - Well, what about you? Zhenya is such a torch. It's expensive to see. - Well done! Go. Everything will be in the best possible way. Pass! I stand! Seryoga, come on with the barbell. Come on. Zhenya. Come on. - Hold on. - Come on, come on. - Oh, you... - Got it! Take it to the parachute layers. I'm at the headquarters of the head of intelligence. Oh! - And where are you? What about in the dining room? - It's none of your business. - There, navigator, cornflowers on the left behind the road. - Go to hell. - The entire composition of the first squadron to the engineer of the regiment! - Aha! - Aha! - Well, where are you going? Where are you going? Busy. Aha! Sobolevsky, give me a voice. - We're here, Kuzmich. Anyuta, sing. Sing, Anyuta! - Darned. In order. - Thank you! - How are they there? - Sing, they tell you. - Here, I will explain in a nutshell. He is actually a musician, albeit a shepherd. And she is a housekeeper. But sings - you will swing. - Who sings? - Anyuta. Orlov. - Which Anyuta? I'm asking you about Katya. You are a jerk, Zhenya. You are an uninteresting person. Bored with you. - Well, uninteresting, don't talk like that. Well, shut up. - Can you be quieter? - Can. - Can. Love will suddenly come when you don't expect it at all. And every evening will immediately become surprisingly good, and you will sing. Heart, you don't want peace. Heart, how good it is to live in the world. Heart, how good that you are. Thank you, heart, that you know how to love so much. What do you know how to love. - Girls, the postman arrived. Hey! Mail! Mail! - Zhenya, you have to. From Lena. Listen, and I give you for this ... I give you for this... I give! Thank you! Is there nothing for me? No, Sergei. - A... - Commander, why haven't they given us orders for a long time? I already drilled a hole, huh? Why give us? How is it for what? We, after all, fly, bomb. Fokker shot down after all. Well, Zhenechka, we have such a profession now, you understand? I understand it. I am for justice. Provide. Since I am worthy, and you all must understand, the matter is the simplest, a man came from the war. Hmm. The man came from the war. Why are you looking at me like that now? - How? - Like Kuzmich. Do you also think that I'm a jerk? And I'm interested in one thing. At the fascist aerodrome a plane has landed and some... obersturmbahnführer pulled the body of his bloody friend out of the hatch, some Hans... How old was Mitka? - Nineteen. - Twenty. He wasn't twenty. - It doesn't matter. Maybe this.. Hans himself was also not twenty. I want to understand. I want to understand. What? What did this führer feel when he laid this dead Hans on the grass. Did he cry? Did he yell at night? - He didn't feel shit. - Why? Fascist, like every normal, is a person who is born with normal human feelings. - And where did they go? And where are the others who Do they love Mozart, do they read Heine? Durer is admired. - Zhenya, they don't have Durer, they now have a führer. Not a human, a deity. And in the pocket of this deity is a snotty handkerchief. In general, I do not care what he felt this führer there, or didn't feel anything. I want him to know one thing, that the fourth Pawn commander was killed, but the commander of Peshka the fifth is alive. And he won't let him sleep peacefully at night. - Clearly, Comrade General. Ready. In fifty minutes. Crew? Senior Lieutenant Arkhiptsev. Excellent crew. Thank you. I understood you. Oh, I wish all this pandemonium would end by now. And then? - And then... Arkhiptsev will sit at the helm like some slow-moving licks. On weekdays they will spray collective farm oats and haul soil. - Well? - And on Sundays, children will roll around. - Contact! There is a contact. Get away from the screw. Choo-choo-choo-choo. Take off and landing in a circle. - Aha ha! Mums, dads, I ask you not to worry, move away from the aeroplane, don't touch it with your hands. Because in the harsh days of the war, we, you know, didn't do that. So, as you say there, mail, children, oats. Well, well, that's wonderful. Fool. It's just great. Kuzmich. Kuzmich. Ha ha! Kuzmich, are you a holy man? What? - You are a holy man. - Tell the truth, the war will end, first where will you go... to Venka for a concert or, of course, to my art exhibition? - You'll see it there. - Ahaha! - Grandmother Kuzya, tell the prodigal granddaughter what will I be in fifteen years? - Ha ha ha! - Fifteen years later I know, and in fifteen minutes, granddaughters, you will have a distant road at an altitude of 3000 metres. At a speed of 400 kilometres per hour. - Viktorov! - Let him turn it off! - Continue. - If Arkhiptsev's calculations are correct, and they coincide with the latest ground reconnaissance square 14B, then in about 20 minutes he will radio the coordinates of this aerodrome. And then the first, second and third squadron. The fighters are covering us. Clear? - So, we strike before scattering on ambush aerodrome while they are still at home. - Squadron commanders to put task for the flight crew. Be ready number one. Starting motors on a green rocket. Let's go by squadron, at different heights. Under cover of fighters. I am the leader of the first squadron. The second squadron height is four thousand metres. - Four thousand metres altitude. Bomb the aerodrome. Plough it so that not a single bastard takes off. By planes. - Bombing to produce from the first call. The second approach with the reduction of machine guns. Disperse! - If you, like last time, have a machine gun jammed, blame yourself. Come on, navigator. Comrade Major, has Arkhiptsev been in touch for a long time? Ten minutes ago. Comrade Lieutenant Colonel, how are you? They follow the course and are silent so as not to reveal themselves. - Clear. - Falcon-105. Falcon-105. I am Ruby. I am Ruby. Answer. Receiving. - Falcon-105. Falcon-105. I am Ruby. I am Ruby. Answer. Receiving. - Ruby, Ruby. I am Falcon-105. from the station there are three. No, four. Five. How do you hear? Receiving. - Stop-footed, stop-footed understood you. Leave immediately. Receiving. - Need to leave. Sobolevsky, attention! - Rubin, Rubin, the calculation was correct. Receiving. Don't dare to fight. Leave. Rubin, Rubin, I don't have time. - Attention everyone! To launch! Rocket! - Eh! Why are you? - I am empty. That's all I wanted to say. - Crap! Me too. - Zhenya! Zhenya! Sobolevsky! Commander, Zhenya isn't answering! - Eugene! Zhenya! Why is the radio silent? Zhenya, what's wrong with you? Zhenya! Zhenya, are you hurt? Zhenya, what's wrong with you? - Falcon-105. Falcon-105. I am Ruby. I am Ruby. Answer. Receiving. Call again.
