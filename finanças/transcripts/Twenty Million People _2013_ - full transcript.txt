"Nowhere Day" by David Mosey ♪ There was a ripple in the tide ♪ I was the tide man watching away ♪ I warned Olympic swimmers ♪ You can't outswim sneaker waves ♪ There was a breaker in the sand ♪ I was the brakeman put in charge ♪ I warned Olympic runners ♪ You can't outrun shooting stars ♪ And when there is a nowhere day ♪ I'll wrap my arms around the hours ♪ Ryan! Ryan! Cindy! Over here! I'm not leaving. I decided not to move to London. I didn't think you were ever coming back. I had to, Ryan. When that psychic told me that I would meet the one, it was your face that popped in my head. But she said it was your ex-girlfriend. What do psychics know anyway? Nothing. Psychics are so wrong, all the time. I've always loved you. From the moment I met you. ♪ Gotta shut the world down ♪ And breakdown so I can see what's left of me ♪ Time for me to be alone ♪ Where I feel home Okay, thank you all for coming to the first film night at The Warehouse. I promise they won't all be romantic comedies. Gay! Yes, it was gay, especially when the guy kissed the girl at the end, that was gay. There's a dictionary behind you, by the way. I thought it was very good. Did you cry? Well, my eyes may have- - You cried at the "Future Perfect." I'm not afraid to let a piece of art move me. What about you Laura, were you moved by that piece of art? Uh, well, I don't cry as easily as Edward, but I thought it was good. Yeah, I didn't really dig it. But you chose it. Yeah, I thought since it was a low-budget deal it wouldn't be so cliche at the end, you know? Hi, can I get a vanilla skim latte? Yeah, sure. That's my thing with romantic comedies though, they end where they should begin, you know? They're in the street, making out. "I've loved you my whole life." "Oh, me too, Ryan." Then what? Where do they go? Does Ryan have indigestion and he's like, "Hey, this has been a great moment" "but my stomach hurts, can we go get some Immodium AD?" It just leads to the usual steps of a relationship, you know? They're in love, everything's great, and then they get used to each other, sex is a chore, they're eating the same three meals every week and then two years later they break up. Then it's all over Facebook, they have to take themselves off Facebook because it's too painful to look at pictures of each other but then they get back on Facebook 'cause it's the only way you can meet anybody new these days 'cause nobody asks for a phone number, it's all Facebook, and you can just repeat the cycle with someone new. Thank you for coming, sorry if I'm, uh- - No, thank you. It was a great film. I mean, don't get me wrong, I liked the movie. But it's just the fun part of the story, you know? What happens afterwards? You are a cynical son of a bitch. I'm a realist. What if it lasts forever? Then they're incredibly lucky and weird. It'll happen for you one day, Brian. Then you'll think differently. Yeah not everybody is you dickheads. I really want to get my poetry in front of people. I did a web series last year but it wasn't on the internet. You have to know about it. Is that how it happened for you guys? Making out on the street like the "Future Perfect?" Great film, man, great freaking film. I thought so too. What was the last film you liked that much, Jason, was it "Happy Feet," "Happy Feet 2?" Yeah, those are good movies, the "Happy Feets." And, um, we still have customers, this is drinking on the job. Yes, it is but how else do you expect me to get through this job? Are you kidding? In this economy, there are 25 Mexicans out there who'd risk their lives to have your job. Well, bring them in here, I need to practice my Spanish anyway. I'm gonna let this slide one time, because it's movie night. Thank you so much, Jason. No, don't drink the beer. I thought you were letting it slide. Up till now, obviously. Stop drinking. Well, I don't know, what would the Mexicans do? The Mexicans wouldn't be drinking. We must know different Mexicans. That's racist. Edward, would you like to finish this? Thank you Jason, yes. Jason, hey. Hey! Thanks for the invite. Ashley, this is Brian, one of my baristas, and Edward and Laura, two of our best regulars. So you're the guy who chose the film? I thought it would be less cliche. No, it was okay. A little cheesy at the end. "Oh, Cindy, it's always been you!" Shoot me in the face, right? Thank you, you're a genius. How are you friends with Jason? Excuse me, your internet connection, I think it's fucked up. All right, one second. We close in 20 minutes, then you can have a beer. I appreciate it. You're a brat. No seriously, you're friends with Jason? Oh, Jason's great. You're not like, dating or anything? Oh god no, no, no. See, that's why I was confused. No, I mean, we went to college together. I just moved here to Jersey City from Brooklyn and he's showing me around. Oh, well, welcome to beautiful downtown Jersey City. Yeah, thank you. I think we're gonna take off, dude. Nice film, Brian. Yeah, well, the fat guy was funny. They always are. You know, you're like the funny fat guy of our group here. That is rude. Well you're fat and funny. I am not funny. Come on, dear, I've been insulted. We'll have to show you around. There's a lot more cool stuff than just this coffee shop. Yeah, I'll stalk you on Facebook. Yeah, there's also one cool bar. One? Is it a dirty strip club? Yes, male strippers though. Funny fat guys? Yes, exactly. So what do you, what's your profession? Profession? I don't even have a job. Well, I had to steal this beer. I stole this dress. Really? Yeah, from a child. Uh, I work at a coffee shop, so. I'm a comedian and actor. Yeah, I'm a filmmaker. Oh, that's why the impeccable taste in films. I thought it would be better! No, it was okay, I'm just fucking with you. It wasn't bad. You wanna hear my theories on relationships? You know I knew there was a reason why I came out tonight. So you have this initial high, right? You're in love. That lasts a few weeks. ♪ Late at night ♪ When I'm awake ♪ And everyone has gone to sleep ♪ I hear a noise ♪ From far away ♪ It's like nothing I've ever heard ♪ I asked my brother ♪ What is that sound ♪ That keeps me from sleeping ♪ He said every time we turn around ♪ Every time we turn around That's what I'm saying, things were different in her generation, people didn't go to therapy. Hey Liz, what are you up to? Just re-reading Leviticus. Friday night, man. I know, I'm such a loser. Well I had a date but it ended early. Oh, you didn't like him? I feel like he just wanted to sleep with me. He just kept staring at my boobs. I told him I was a Christian and he thought I was joking, so. Back to Leviticus. You know? I mean, where is my real life Jesus Christ? Probably in the Middle East. Yeah, right? Water. Two people come together to decide to be a certain thing. They say, okay, here's who we are, here's what we like to do and if one of them strays too far from that- - It's break up city. Exactly. Yeah, I'm just over the whole thing. You know my psychic says when I'm 30, I'm gonna meet the man of my dreams. I'm sorry, your psychic, like in that movie? You're joking, right? Yeah, I'm kidding. Well, I'm kind of kidding. Ehh, I do have a psychic. You have a psychic? Like people have a therapist you have a psychic? Well no, they're cheaper and just as valid. You're insane. That's something I found out about you just now, you're an insane person. That's good, let's get it all out now. You pay to talk to someone, just like therapy. You've never been? No. Five years in New York City and you've never been to a psychic? Absolutely not. Oh, we're going. No way. Yeah, I'm gonna take you to one. I don't want to go. Yes, what are you scared of? I'm scared that they're gonna give me a ring and say you need to go on a quest and put this ring in a volcano or else the world is gonna end. You are a dork. - I'm not a dork - You are a big fat dork. I'm not fat. You know what I fucking hate? Weddings. Me too. - The horrible DJ, - Yes. The old people laughing at the crazy kids dancing. Yes, if I ever get married, no DJ. Maybe a jazz band. Oh, my first wedding is gonna have a grunge cover band. What about the next couple weddings? Oh, I figure by that time it's just off to the courthouse. Of course. See, Ed and Laura say I'm pessimistic and I'm selfish, but I don't want to get married and have kids. You know why? Because you're immature? Yes, 'cause I'm immature. Also because I don't want to be in my 40's and have every other weekend taken up. You like that one, don't you? You can use that in your act. Oh, I'm not a total asshole on stage. Fair enough. Sorry. Your roommate's nuts, you know that? Yep. Nuts for Jesus. I can't wait 'till we get our own place. I miss my nieces so much. Yeah. I think I want to move back home. Really? Yeah, well, I mean. Wow, I just said that, huh? Yeah, you did. Well, I mean, I'm just thinking about it. What would that mean for us? Well, I don't know. I mean, you don't want to move to St. Louis, right? Yeah, no, I cannot do that. Well, I guess that's why we need to talk about it. So how definite is this? It's not definite. I mean there's this. This meaning me. Well I don't want to lose you, Laura. I don't want to lose you either, Edward, that's- - But you want to leave New York? I want to be with my family. I need that right now. And not this. I didn't say that. Well, marry me, I don't know. Yeah, see, those are the kinds of words that are gonna come back to haunt us. I just asked you to marry me. No you didn't. You just said, "Well, I don't know, marry me." The point was the "marry me" part. It wasn't even in the form of a question. I mean, I don't think we're strong enough. We can be stronger. I don't think we can. Do you? I guess not. Fuck, are we breaking up? This really sucks, I wasn't trying to do this- - Don't do it. Well, I don't know what to do, you- - It's just, like, out of nowhere. ♪ I'll be waiting So, you gonna see her tonight? We're gonna see each other whenever. When do you want to see her? She's not looking for a relationship either, man. Ooh, you found someone as cold and cynical as you? Yes, exactly. You found your soulmate. I found someone who also doesn't believe in stupid shit like soulmates, yeah. That's good. How can anyone believe in a soulmate, it's stupid. 'Cause you only have the people you meet to choose from, right? So, say you live in a small town. You got like, that guy or that guy to choose from. How can that be a soulmate? And in the greater New York City area there's 20 million people which gives us 50 soulmates each, which negates the whole concept. Yeah. Could I get a refill? Yeah, sure. Oh, I don't wanna make a big thing but Laura and I may have broken up last night. What? Yeah, it's not definite. What the fuck? I never would have said that whole thing about soulmates- - Yeah, this is why I don't want to make a big thing. She's just thinking about moving back home to be with her family. Are you kidding me? Ed, that's crazy. You know, I get it, family. You get it? Are you not filled with emotion right now? I mean, you can let it out. Yeah, yeah but you know, it's not definite. Well, where did you leave it? She had to go to work. That's where you left it, she went to work? We don't have to talk about it all day. Let's just go grab that coffee. Oh, is that your soulmate? Yeah, she fucking loves me, dude.

And if it sounds crackly, that means that it's probably dry and not good. It should be moist enough that there's just a little squeeze in it. Oh, and if it smells sweet, that means it's good. And sometimes it can smell, like, sour and that means that it's probably moldy. Wow. And where do they manufacture girls like you who know this? The fucking awesome factory. So is this a good cigar? I don't know. How much do you want to spend? Well, he's my brother but it's his third kid, so the price has to go down exponentially, I think. Yeah, I think so. By this point you probably should just by him a cigarette or something. All right, sit down. Why? Sit down with it. You think I look funny with a cigar in my mouth. No, I think you look sexy with that cigar- - Oh, well in that case. Let me see you work it. Yeah! All right, now like you're a real tough guy. You're the head of a very dangerous crime family. Yeah, I'm a real tough guy, head of a very dangerous crime family. Yeah, you walk in here, asking me a favor? Why shouldn't I just rip your kneecaps from your legs, you dirty son of a bitch? Yes! That's good. You're going to Hollywood, kid, you're gonna be a big star. Yeah, there was one time I believed that. So, should we buy this cigar? Yeah, I think we kind of have to now. Thank you. Thanks. You have a gigantic head. You have a gigantic head. You have a gigantic head. So how are the tips here? I don't know if I trust Jersey people. Well, it's not Manhattan money, but I can walk here. The coffee tastes like poop. Why did you get coffee at a bar? Um, I'm an addict, a junkie. I had to give the kitchen guy a hand job. Hey, don't joke, I have friends who are addicts. I have friends who give hand jobs. I said don't joke. Hey, I used to do drugs too. Oh really? I never thought you'd be cool enough to do drugs. Oh yeah, all the classics. I don't want to get involved with anyone who does drugs. So are we getting involved? I said I don't want to get involved. Right, yeah, me neither. Yeah, are we really even talking about this right now? We don't have to. Let sleeping dogs lie. You know, that's the most romantic thing anyone's ever said to me. But you are working at my watering hole now, so if we stop talking to each other one of us is gonna have to go. Well, they're putting me up on their open mic tonight so I'm like a fixture here. Hey, I've been a fixture here. I kept them in business in 2008. I haven't taken a day off in a month. From drinking? Why are we even talking about this? We're gonna last at least a few more weeks. Oh, that's optimistic. Plus, you might get fired. Why? That table's waving at you. Excuse me. For those of you in the back, I am standing. "I'm 4'9" on my license. For some reason really, really tall guys really dig me. Which isn't so bad, I have most of the conversation to their crotch. And that is not a bad thing, ladies. But last night it did have its downfall. I went out on a date and he was very tall, very sexy. And the waiter brought us to our table and brought him the wine list and brought me a placemat and a box of crayons. Yeah. For appetizers we ordered coconut shrimp and it ended in an Amber Alert. Next thing I know Chris Hanson came in and arrested my date. Hey. You work at The Warehouse. Vanilla skim latte. Always on the clock. I am a workaholic. Clearly. I'm Nicole. Brian. That's funny, we see each other every morning and- - Are you a comedian? No, no, I'm a filmmaker. Oh cool. I'm friends with Marisa, she's the one with the- - She's the slutty one. Yeah. Well that's what her act was about. Yeah, she's really funny. Who are you here to see? Ashley, the girl who goes on- - Oh yeah, the single girl who goes on all the bad dates. Yeah, the single girl. Guess she's not so single after all, huh? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, right. Well, see you in the morning. Yeah, see you in the morning. You brat, I told you not to come! Hey, you were really funny. I just need to get over that hump, you know? A rebound girl. You tired of rebound jerking off? Sounds like an extreme sport. Yeah, right, with bumpers on the walls. I haven't had sex with anyone but Laura in over two years. I don't remember how you get girls to sleep with you. Ashley, can you get us a roofies and Coke from the bar? Actually, I'm gonna go home. Not into date rape humor? I just had a weird set, I want to do some writing tomorrow. Okay, so I'll call you. Yeah, I'm gonna be pretty busy tomorrow though. Okay, so I'll call you the day after. Okay, or- - Or totally not the day after. Or I'll call you. Okay. Whichever. All right, bye. Uh, can I have a kiss, or? See you guys. Was that just weird? Yep. You wanna get drunker? Yep. Okay. Hey, it's me. Did you know that near my house is a place that serves beer and has video games? Yeah, well, I'd like to challenge you to a "Ms. Pac-Man off." I was thinking maybe you could "Pac me off" and I'll "Ms. Pan-Man you off." Anyway, um, give me a call back, I work tomorrow but then I have the next couple days off after that. And, uh, love to hang out. All right, later. I like how it's not clingy, you know? I mean, we haven't even talked in a couple days. Is that why you keep checking your phone? Well, I left her a message. And sent her some texts and an email and it's her turn to contact me, that's all. Yeah, I got it, okay. Yeah, how are you holding up, man? How about you? I'm good. I'm doing better every day. Thinking about starting to do T'ai Chi. T'ai Chi would be great. Yeah, I think it would be really helpful. We should both start doing T'ai Chi. T'ai Chi would be so awesome right now. No, man, that's why I came here, I haven't seen her. I don't know what to tell you. She was a no-call, no-show today. That's the transient nature of this whole thing, isn't it? Easy come, easy go. Sorry, what whole thing? This, everything, life. You all right, man? Uh, he just got out of a relationship. Oh shit, sorry. Yeah, whiskey and porn. That's how you get through this, trust me. Well I got the whiskey part down. It's whiskey and porn. That's very, very important. You need both to get through this. That's actually pretty brilliant. I guess that's my life now, isn't it? I think it has to be. Yeah, you know, you're gonna want to start out with your average gangbangs and deep throats out of the San Fernando Valley. Eventually you're gonna want to step it up. Right now I'm watching lesbian yoga videos from France. I've been single six months. That's impressive. Whiskey and porn. Yeah, whiskey and porn. Hey Ashley, it's Brian. You might remember me from such nights as "the awesome one we had last weekend" or "the time we had sex eight times in 24 hours." Anyway, give me a call, love to see what's going on. Sorry, dude. That's it? She just disappears? Quits her job and doesn't call me back? That's how the ball bounces. Not on me, the ball doesn't bounce on me like that. I decide where the balls bounce. Men have been trying to bounce their own balls since the beginning of time. The physics do not work. I don't get it, everything was going fine. You said she didn't want a relationship, right? Yeah, okay, have the decency to say goodbye at least. I don't want a relationship either. Maybe she had, like, an emergency or something. Yeah, emergency sex with some guy with a real job. Don't think like that, man. What am I supposed to do? I wish I could help. I'm gonna go home and look at porn. You wanna come? Tempting, I'm good, thank you. You wanted her to be your girlfriend, didn't you? That's not the point. Sorry brother. What are you so happy about? It's not gonna work out. She might just disappear one day. She's not gonna disappear. Oh please, help yourself to a Pinot Noir. Did you even watch the movie? I went through a lot to get her. Yeah, it seemed a little hokey, I'll be honest. Well life's a little hokey, Brian. You know, you're one of those guys, you're so clever, you're always criticizing everything, trying to be funny. And that's why you're sleeping alone tonight and I'm having sex with her. Sup dude. Hey Cindy, from the movie. I actually have cramps tonight, Ryan, so- - There you go, real life, cramps. Yeah, so? She's still my girlfriend, you know. Maybe I'll just get a blow job. I'm not gonna do that. Whichever, doesn't matter. Can we just go to bed? Sure honey. That's my bedroom. Fictional assholes. Fictional assholes. Jason, hey. Brian, you're not on the schedule today, right? No, right. Listen, have you seen Ashley? What do you mean? She disappeared, have you talked to her? Not since movie night. Why, did you hook up with her or something? Yeah, sure, but now she's gone. I didn't say you could date her. No, that's done, that conversation has expired. What if I was trying to hook up with her? Nobody cares what you think about me dating Ashley because she's a missing person now and you don't matter. Well, that's rude. I am a human being, not just your boss. I'm sorry, I'm stressed out. If you would have talked to me sooner I could've warned you. She's a man eater. Well, that wouldn't have stopped me, I'm a woman eater. And not just in a vaginal way. You didn't stand a chance. You should have talked to me first, bro. I'm the Wizard of Oz of women. Yeah, and the Elmer Fudd of metaphors. Can you check and see if she's on your Facebook? She may have unfriended me. Maybe she moved back to Brooklyn. You want me to check or what? Brooklyn. That's the other side of the fucking universe. Well, other side of Manhattan, actually. There's only six miles between you two, you know. Yeah, geographically. Fucking Brooklyn.

Excuse me, do you like comedy? Really? Shouldn't you be in Times Square. That didn't work. We need an activity. We're standing around like counselors at a weird adult day camp. Hey, sorry! My frisbee. Hey, my buddy and I are new to the neighborhood. Do you know where the cool coffee shops or bars are or anything? Sorry dude, really stoned. Oh, that's cool. Hey, do you happen to know a girl named Ashley Williams. Totally, man. Yeah, definitely. You do? Yeah. But the question is, man, do you? Do you? Thanks man. Good stuff, really, keep it up. Probably have PhD's. Should we split up and look for clues? Fuck, where did we park the Mystery Machine? Yeah, it's good to see you got your sense of humor back. Woah, woah, woah. She has this weird thing with psychics. Just like in the "Future Perfect." It's your own romantic comedy. Yeah, just don't start crying or anything. We should go in. Goddammit Ashley. So you're Dina? It's Russian. Watch your step. You are looking for something. Yes, we are. You. You are searching for something. For the answer. Is that whiskey? Is herbal tea from Russia. It looks like whiskey. It is not whiskey. Can I have some? I am not allowed to sell beverages, health department, you know. Can I smell it? My tea is irrelevant. The answer is inside of you. How do you know he's not seeking something? We all seek something. That's true. Do you know where his thing is? Sure, it's inside of him. So it's just generally inside us. Maybe. What are you seeking? We are not here for me. I'm looking for a girl named Ashley. I know. You didn't know that. I told you that. You didn't say Ashley. I didn't have to. Do you know where she is? What do I look like, a wizard? Do wizards really exist? Maybe. Let's get back on topic, Brian. They might. Do you know any wizards? Not personally, no. So what is it that I'm seeking in here specifically? The key to finding Ash-ney. Ashley. That does kind of make sense. Yeah, it does, actually, yeah. You want receipt? Uh, yeah, that'd be great. Wait here. Tax write-off. Whiskey. There's a tall drink of water here in the front row. What's your name? Robert. Robert, how tall are you? 6'4". 6'4"? Come on up here! Everyone, give Robert a round of applause, let's get him up here. And are you single or married? I'm single. Boxers or briefs. Where are you from? Seattle. Do you like long walks on the beach? And that's my life, folks, in a nut sack, so to speak. Everyone give Robert a round of applause. He did a great job. She might not be on Facebook but she's gonna be doing comedy somewhere and that's gotta be advertised on Facebook so I just need to friend a bunch of comedians, I think. Actually, I think maybe you should just give up and move on. What, seriously? You know, it's been a while. And she's gone, I'm sorry if you can't accept it. Ed, I can accept it, I just want an explanation. The explanation is inherent, I think. Why are you being an asshole? I'm not being an asshole. I'm just saying, you've never done this to girls? Just disappear? Yeah, just kind of fade away, not have the balls to actually break up with them? I mean, maybe- - Look, it's like a boomerang. Or it's like that movie, "Boomerang." It is like the movie "Boomerang," thank you. Everything is happening exactly like in "Boomerang." The scars of Brian McGehee do not heal quickly. You can trust me on this 'cause I'm friends with some of those girls. Where's all this coming from? There's a certain level of reality you need to face. You're not in college anymore, it's not a game. Yeah, I know it's not a game, that's my whole point. I think you just need to deal with it. Like you're dealing with Laura leaving you? I don't know. Because you're not. I am dealing with it. You're not really letting it out though, are you? Okay, I don't even know where you came from. Few years ago, I was in a band. First year all we did was make fun of all the other bands out there. "Oh look at them, they sound like Blink 182. "Oh, look at that guy with his little tassels "on his red leather pants. "What a bunch of dick suckers," right? Yeah, sure. Then after a year we stopped playing, we fizzled out. Turns out, guys, we were the dick suckers. Sometimes late at night I wake up in a cold sweat and I go and look in the bathroom mirror and I go, "What happened? "That was my moment, that was my shot." "We had the talent, we had a van." We were afraid to put ourself out there. We were afraid to make ourself vulnerable. We were scared that some group of judgmental dick suckers was gonna see us one night and go, "Those guys suck dick." True, true. Yeah. My point is, you gotta be willing to say how you feel. And make it stupid. Don't ever be afraid to be stupid. Okay, well I- - I got a customer. Keep going, make it stupid. Okay. Um, I have a bag of her stuff still. Yeah, yeah, that's stupid. It's just sitting there in my room. I don't know what to do with it. It's just like, you know, some shoes, her sweater, some papers. Yeah. You know and it, it like has her smell on it. I tried to, I tried to cover it up, I tried to get rid of it. I sprayed Axe Body Spray on it. That means you went to the store and bought Axe Body Spray. Keep going. Yeah, pretty stupid. Yeah, that's okay. I do feel better. Yeah? Yeah, that's- - You feel better? Yeah, wow, okay. All right, let's get outta here. Okay. ♪ Stolen all my energy ♪ A hive without a honeybee ♪ Now I'll never find a way ♪ Yellow fever burns my face ♪ Maybe it will never break ♪ This could be my final day ♪ These blue tears run down my cheek ♪ Fill my mouth, I cannot speak ♪ Run, run, run down my cheek If it's any consolation, I always thought she was uptight. You thought Laura was uptight? Oh I see, because I'm a Christian I can't think anyone's uptight. No, no, no but it's great to hear something bad about her. I'll mail the stuff. So you don't have to look at it anymore. Thanks. Her bed is still here, the new roommate's gonna take it. Oh yeah. Yeah, if you wanna have one last look at it. Kinda weird but okay. You're in love with her. Oh, that might be a strong word. I think you're being a little dramatic. Yeah, you're right I'm sorry. I would hate to interrupt your perfectly normal evening jibber-jabbering about love. But you know what we can do? Why don't we just sit down and continue to enjoy that movie that you keep watching over and over and over again, which is the only film you've made in what, two years? I can't wait to see how it ends. You are like the meanest imaginary friend I could ever- - I'm a straight shooter. Straight shoot you in the face. Shoot you in the face. I don't know, maybe you have some good memories on it. Yeah, maybe. I live on the other side of this wall, remember? Oh right, sorry. Don't be embarrassed. I should be embarrassed. Why? I used to wake up and play with myself while you were doing it. Wow. See? Yeah no, that's fine, that's okay. I imagined it was me instead. I want to kiss you right now but I'm really conflicted because I'm dedicated to Jesus and everything. I can't compete with Jesus. Nobody can. Why don't we forget about Jesus? I could never forget about Jesus. We're in a pickle. I think this is why the Protestants branched off in the first place. Edward. Yep. You want to fuck me on your ex-girlfriend's bed? Yep. So you broke up with him? I need a husband, okay, I'm not fucking around here. Hi, have you been helped yet? Nope. Just a coffee to go. Sorry about that, I'll get that for you right now. Fucking men. He asks me if he can have a drum solo. I'm thinking to myself, this guy thinks he's John Bonham or something, I don't know. Nobody's had a successful drum solo in at least 30 years in my opinion. All I'm trying to do is make a good record. Ashley. Hey, Ashley. Hi, Brian. Hi, yeah, I thought that was you. Didn't even see you. Yeah I saw you walking and I was just in the neighborhood. Yeah, what are you doing in Brooklyn? Oh some friends of mine are having a really cool party. Cool party. Yeah, well, really cool. Really cool. Oh, this is Eric. Hey. Sup bro. Right, um... Well, it was good to see you. Really? What? I mean that's it? It was good to see you? Well, it's kind of awkward. Am I making this awkward? Oh god, no, no. I feel like I am. No. Hey dude, my bust if I'm making this awkward. No, no, it's fine, I was just, I was walking, I saw you... Awkward, okay, listen we gotta bounce, we got dinner reso's so it was really nice to meet you. Guess we'll see you around the hood. Sorry if I'm like, argh! You know what I'm saying, man? Oh hey. Uh-huh, hell yeah, order up the apps. I'll call you, okay? I don't care. Well there you go. Well there you go. If you need parking, it's right on over there, okay? Okay. So just come with me. Great example you're setting, Brian. I think I need a prescription for marijuana. I have really bad hangovers. This is Stephanie. You're going to be training her today. Sorry for my appearance, I turned on my shower and Maker's Mark came out. Oh, it's okay, I'm in college so I'm used to it. Okay, so, he'll give you the tour and then we'll talk about coffee? Oh yeah, I just gotta put my hair up real quick. And no flirting, okay? This is a professional environment. Oh come on, you flirt with me every day. Yeah right, no I don't. Okay, so I'm ready for the tour. Okay. Wait, I just need to put my hair up too. Um, so, tables, chairs, windows, and there's a coffee shop inside. You good? You're very funny. I actually might throw up but maybe not. I'll be right back. You know, you're gonna regret it. Oh good, I was hoping the character from the movie had a place to brush his teeth. You're in love with Ashley. Taking advantage of the new girl at work is not gonna make you feel any better. Oh no, see, that's what happens in your world. I realize I'm only in love with Ashley. In my world, I get really drunk and I go down on that girl out there and I love every minute of it. Whatever you say, dude. Ashley left me. She left the entire state of New Jersey. What does it matter what I want? Well, if you're not gonna do anything about it, then it doesn't matter. Yeah, exactly. 'Cause in real life you don't convince girls to love you back so you deal with it. Suck it up. Wow. I'm glad I don't actually exist, it sounds like a real drag. It is. How do I look? Fine. You gonna throw up? 'Cause if you are, I'm gonna leave. Yeah, I am. So, tomorrow there's a farmers' market in the park and then my friends are having a house warming party so I thought we could go to that. Or maybe we could go see a movie or something, or we could just hang out here. Are we gonna smoke any pot or are we just gonna go to sleep? Whatever you want to do, I am super easy going, you're gonna find out. I'm from a small town in upstate New York. What kind of food do you like? I love hot dogs, especially when they're super loaded, fully loaded! Turns out she's a total freak. That's great, congratulations. I feel so dirty. Oh come on, you love it. Yeah, I do love it, that's what I'm saying. It's just been a rough couple weeks. Laura moving out of state, I sleep with her crazy Christian roommate. You know, besides clearly going to hell, I have the ideal break up situation. That's true, you are going to hell. I should probably get to work. You all right? Um, not really. You wanna grab a beer later? Actually, I should probably be alone right now. You were right. It is like that movie, "Boomerang." Good morning. Asshole. Is that the new girl? Yep. You guys used to date or something? Uh, yeah, I dated her last Thursday night. So she's single? I'll see you later, man. All right. All right. Brian, can you come here for a sec. She said she was 21. What? I'm just kidding. What's up, playa? Sit down. Okay. You've been working here a long time. And the customers like you and I like you and you're a good guy. Great intro to... And it's very hard but I'm going to have to let you go. You're gonna have to let me go from working here? I'm very sorry to have to do this, Brian. Because of the new girl? What does she have to do with anything? Nothing, that's what I'm asking. Look, Brian, you've worked here a long time, you spend most of your time on the phone, you drink on the job, you seem bored. Yeah, of course I'm bored. Your attitude is just not up to par. It's a coffee shop, Jason. I have a coffee shop attitude. Maybe and I'm taking things to another level and I don't think you fit with what I have planned. Okay. I'll stop being on my phone. It's not just about the phone. Oh my god, I am being fired from a job I'm way too good for. You're ridiculous, Brian. I'm not the ridiculous one. See, this is what I was hoping to avoid. What, you think I'm gonna get all mad and crazy because you're firing me from this stupid bullshit job? This is a paycheck to me, Jason, I don't care about it. Then why would I not fire you? Because you're a tool. Because you should be somewhere in Ohio managing a fucking Applebee's. Because this is your life, here, making lattes for rich assholes and one day I'm gonna laugh at this stupid little job I had. Okay, man, whatever you say. Yeah, it is whatever I say. Because it's my life and this was just a stepping stone. Well I'm glad we were lucky enough to fit into the story of your life, we're so honored. Yeah, you should be honored. We are, thank you. You're fucking welcome. Stupid, fire me, what a stupid thing to do. You're not even giving me a chance to explain myself. It doesn't matter, Eric. You want to be with a bunch of people, that's fine. Well, what do you want? I'm not 22 anymore. We can try not to see other people If we have to try, doesn't that seem doomed for failure? So you don't want to see me at all anymore just because we're not exclusive? I gave up a lot just to come out here and I don't even know where this is going. Yeah, but we've been together for like two years. I know you better than anybody. No, we've been together a year and a half and everything else has been shitty. Yeah but we have to let it evolve. Maybe we can get back to where we used to be. It's not easy for us, we're artists. I'm trying to be a rock star, Ash, what do you want me to do? I can't hang on anymore. But you know we can't stay away from each other. We haven't really tried, you know? You went all the way to fucking New Jersey. You know, I just think we need to separate. Yeah, but we won't. We need to try. You know that's not gonna happen. We need to. I just, I just want to be alone. Fine. I gotta go to work anyway. Okay. I don't know, I guess I'll see you sometime in the future or something.. So does this mean you're not gonna answer my texts if I get bored at the bar tonight? No, Eric, I'm not gonna answer your texts. Okay. Cool. Till next time then. That took a lot of balls. I need a drink. Way ahead of you. Why did I think this time would be different? I told you, he's not the one you're supposed to be with. But I have a real love for him. No one says, "I have a love for you." Those aren't the words people say to each other. I have a love for a lot of dudes. That's doesn't mean I'm gonna put up with their bullshit. Well here's to being alone again. Except for imaginary friends from mediocre movies. Cheers, bitch. So, million dollar question. What about Jersey City? I left Jersey City. And Brian? Just another boy who doesn't want to be in a relationship. You never really talked about it though. That's all we ever talked about, how no relationship can last more than two years. You were only together two weeks. Well, what's the difference? He's not serious about anything. Maybe he's ready for something more. Yeah right, not everybody is like Mr. Perfect over here. That's true. He said he didn't care on the street. I'm not gonna go chasing after him. He should be chasing after me. Maybe he was. ♪ Late at night ♪ When I'm awake ♪ And everyone has gone asleep ♪ I hear a noise ♪ From far away When I woke up the next morning, there was no one to give that congratulatory high-five to, so I gave it to myself. Which I regretted immediately afterward because then I had to explain why I was clapping. I was like, uh, "You remember that scene from 'Independence Day' "where Bill Pullman gives that speech?" It just snuck up on me I just "had to clap it out." You guys are doing great so far, we got a couple more. Our next one up, oh, he's a first timer. This is Brian, Mc, Kee Hee, Brian Mc-kee-hee. McGehee, it's a tough one. Hi. I have decided recently that I don't believe in soulmates. I am a soulmatheist, I believe in watching, I believe in people who like the same movies as you, but not a soulmate. My friends say that I'm too pessimistic and selfish to get married and have kids. Well, maybe they're right, but I just don't want to be in my 40's and have every other weekend taken up. People with divorced parents get that joke faster I think. But the joke's on them, 'cause their parents are divorced. Just a couple more. Last call, Brian. It's 1:30, last call's not till 1:45. Yeah, there's no one else here, man, last call. That's bullshit. Stupid fucking Jersey bar. All right man, you know what, we're closed. This one's on me. Woah, woah. Get out of here, Brian. Chill out, man, chill out. It's a bar, I need to drink. Yeah, time's up, man, go home. Yeah, normally bars stay open till two, man. I don't know if you know that or not but, you're kind of weak. This is kind of a weak bar and you're a weak bartender, I've always thought that. Get home safe, Brian. You big ol' dick sucker. Where's Cindy? We broke up. I knew it. No, I'm just kidding. We're not real people so you're an idiot. I'm not okay, man, I'm fucking hungover and miserable and I don't know, it's not just Ashley, I mean, we weren't even really together, you know? You've seen too much of the other side, now you can't go back. I was happy with my life before. Look at this playground. All these families and kids, everything's terrific. Yeah. It's beautiful. It's true. I mean, look at them, the kids are in heaven, the parents are totally alive and happy. They have it right, man, not me. You're welcome for making you realize that. I'm feeling a little underappreciated here. Okay, but so what? Ashley's more cynical than I am. Not to mention the fact that she moved to Brooklyn and is with some guy and she unfriended me on fucking Facebook. You haven't really tried, have you? To what, win her back? No, that's so cliche. Then what? To tell her how you feel. You finally believe in something enough to chase it down. To put yourself out there. Yeah, that's easy for you to say, you live in a romantic comedy. Yeah, and I get the girl at the end and everybody watches it anyway because, you know what, in real life most of the time it doesn't work out so it's fun to see when it does. But this, this is real. You feel that burning emotion, that fear, your heart's beating fast, your hands are shaking. You don't say anything clever, you just say, "I like you, a lot." And no matter what happens at least you know you lived your life in that moment. Yeah, you might be right. Why would I be here if I wasn't right? I should probably stop watching children in the playground. Yeah, you're looking a little creepy right now. Hey Brian. Hey man. I don't have your paycheck yet. I'm not here for a paycheck. What can I do for you? I just want to say that I'm sorry. And you were right. My attitude was shitty and I think I just, I worked here a long time and I was bitter and jaded 'cause, you know, I'm not really doing what I wanna do in life. I took it out on you and I was a dick. You weren't a dick, Brian. I was acting like one. You know, maybe my time here was up and, you know, I get that. Thanks, man, that's cool of you to say. I'm better than that. I know you are. I just want you to know that. Of course. I wouldn't be friends with you if you weren't. Cool. So if I need to put you down as a reference, I can- - Yeah, of course. Okay. Can I grab an espresso? Don't push it, asshole. Come on inside. Jason, some girl left her phone here last night? She leaves her phone here twice a week, that forgetful scamp. I got it, thanks Stephanie. Stephanie, hey, wait, um. Listen, I'm sorry if what happened between us caused you any- - It's fine, Brian. Good. I am sorry though. I just don't know why you would sleep with me if you didn't want to be my boyfriend. Seriously? I guess you taught me an important lesson. Look, in my world, I'm not an asshole, okay? I'm just a guy trying to figure it out. But you took advantage of me. Yes, in reality. But not in the alternate reality in which I choose to live. There's only one reality, Brian. I'm starting to realize that. So, in reality I was an asshole. And I'm sorry. That's fine. At least you got fired. There you go. Okay, well then, I'll see you around then. Okay. I'm actually going to get a coffee, so. Oh. So we'll say goodbye again later. Regular coffee? Espresso. Double actually, if it's okay. Did they train you on the machine yet? You want to feel the energy going through your arms, up from the ground, out into the world. That's great, man. Yeah, I mean, whiskey and porn got me through initially, but you know, I had to move on. Have you talked to Laura at all? No, like not at all. Which is sort of romantic, in a weird way. Like, no Facebook, no emails, it's the way it should be, you know? I hope she's doing well and everything but I've gotta live my life. So you're not Googling her or? Oh, I'm Googling the shit out of her, yeah, just not every single day now. That's good to hear. Yeah the T'ai Chi really helps. There's a coffee shop in Tribeca that's hiring. Closer to being a filmmaker, De Niro probably comes in for espresso. What about Ashley? You still Googling her? I think I'm gonna text her today. Maybe she'll answer this time. Really? Yeah, I wanna talk to her face to face though. Why don't you call her. Yeah right, I'm gonna call her. I haven't called anyone since 2005. I think you should call her. Really? Do people like that? Yeah, calling is the new talking face to face. Okay, yeah, I'll call her. What are you gonna say? I'm gonna say that I like her. That's nice. Yeah, I think that's all I can say. I like you. Yeah. Brilliant, simple. You know. I mean she can do whatever she wants with that information, probably nothing but at least I will say, "I like you." Well, good luck. Thank you. All right, get up here. Yep, let me join you. Let's do some T'ai Chi. I'm gonna Chi all over the place. Chi on your face. Chi all over your butthole. That is very Zen. All right, I'm calling her, don't listen. I'm gonna hear what you're saying. You're making me self-conscious. I'm not listening. Thank you. What? I can't hear! I wasn't prepared to leave a message. Call her back. She let it go to voicemail, she'll think I'm psycho. You called and didn't leave a message? That's psycho too. Like I'm on the window ledge? One last phone call? I'm psycho no matter what. That's it, I'm never calling anyone again. Why'd you do that to me? I'm gonna text her. Don't text him, just show up. This is real life, people just don't show up. What if he has a girlfriend at the coffee shop? At least you took a chance. I'm texting him. Don't text him. Ugh, you're so fucking- Fine. I hope you get fat. "Hey Ashley, love to meet up sometime if it's cool." That sounds fine, send it. It sounds creepy though. Just out of nowhere. How about, "Hey Ashley, how are you?" "I was just thinking about you." Ooh, that's creepy. It has to have an exclamation point, you know? Everything you text has to have an exclamation point or it sounds sarcastic. "How are you?!" "Fun, casual text!" "Life is great!" "I'm not miserable!" "No one you love is ever gonna die!" Yeah, that's good, I'll send that. Oh my god, how did he take it? Very poorly, very embarrassing for him. I bet. But then he came back and apologized. And he apologized to the new girl too. Why did he apologize to her? Oh, 'cause he slept with her. Okay. Yeah, sorry. No, I mean, I don't expect- - Then I slept with her too. Jason, you cad. What can I say? Can't you get in trouble? Won't you lose your job if she tells the owner? She won't. We're kind of dating now. Nice. Yeah. I'm completely in love with her. That's great, congratulations. Yeah, it's on the down low, though, very exciting. Great. We just had sex in the bathroom. And that's where we stop. Just like five minutes ago. Yep, wrapping it up. I got to go. Really? Yeah, I gotta make a phone call. You know, he was hung up on you pretty hard. Yeah? Definitely. You kind of crushed him. Okay, "Wondering what you're up to." "Would love to grab coffee." Sounds good. And then we hit send. Just do it. I am sending it right- Wait. Just do it. "Hey, I'm in Jersey City. "Would love to meet up." No, that's weird, why would you say you're in Jersey City? No, she's in Jersey City. That's from her, just now. She just texted you? Yeah, she's here. Huh. Should I wait a couple minutes so it's not like I'm standing here with the phone in my hand? Oh, I don't know. Yeah, probably. Yeah. Okay. Okay. Okay now. Yes, now. ♪ We could have stopped this from happening ♪ It's a little late for that, sweetheart, don't you think ♪ Don't you think ♪ But there are things I meant to clear ♪ Things I should have said to those I hold dear ♪ Hi, how are you? Good, good. Good. You're in Jersey. Yeah, it's weird. Yeah, it is. Well it's not that weird. No, I guess not. I mean all you did was talk about how you didn't want to be in a relationship. Yeah, at least I wasn't already in one. I wasn't. I don't even know, are you still? I just needed to figure things out. I guess we should have talked about it. Yeah, that would have been smart. Yeah, it would have been. How was I supposed to take you seriously when you were always just- - I don't, I just, I don't know, I guess I wasn't ready to show how I was feeling. That might sound stupid. I mean, I didn't know if you liked me or if you were just having fun. No. Yes, I liked you, that's what I'm saying. I still like you, Ashley, I like you. A lot. That's the shaky thing my hands are doing, so I think I'm on the right track with saying that. Heart's beating fast and everything. I like you a lot too. And it really sucked when you disappeared. I know, I'm sorry. I just didn't want to drag you through all my baggage and shit. Where is it now? Are you still seeing this guy at all? No, it's over. But I'm gonna stay in Brooklyn because I have a place there and I gave this one up and- - Yeah, sure. But um, it's not too far away. I don't know, over all those tall buildings there. You don't have to go over the buildings, you can go under them now by train. Oh right, right, right. Yeah. Well, this has been good. Yes, it has. Um, do you want to get something to eat or? Yeah. Are you hungry? Not really. Me neither. I wasn't gonna be able to live with myself if I didn't do that. You can do that, I mean, we've already had sex like a million times. I know but you never know if the door is back open or if it's been shut and you have to go get the key and- - Nobody knows what you're talking about. No, not at all. So do you want to take a walk, or? Yeah, yeah, let's just take a walk. Okay. I guess I could eat. Yeah, me too. My stomach kind of hurts right now. Do you have to poop? No, but I appreciate you checking. A little inappropriate. That's a little much, just go home at that point.
