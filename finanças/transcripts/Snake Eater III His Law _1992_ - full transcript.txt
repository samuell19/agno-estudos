- I gave you a 20. - You gave me a 10. Check the cash lady, that is my other 10. Check the cash. What's your problem? Yes, can I help you? Gimme the money from the drawer, all of it. Good, while you're in there, you mind getting change for my 20? This ain't no joke. Give it to me now. Shut up. Nobody move, nobody move or I blow her brains away. I swear you'll be pickin' 'em off the floor. You. Give me the key now. I don't have the key. Don't fuck with me, man. She threw it back there, find it! Wait, wait. Shit. I don't get that key in 10 seconds, she's dead meat. 10, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two. One, one. What is this, Sesame Street, for Christ sakes? I know how to count, one. All right, nobody move, nobody gets hurt. Hey, what the hell's going on in here? Drop the gun or I blow her away. You Robbin' this place? No, I'm taking a survey, what's it look like? This is my robbery, I came in to rob this place. Fuck off, I got here first. Move out of the way. Let me take over. You're gonna have to kill me first. Hey man, what are we doing? We're wasting time. Look, we both came here for the same thing, right? So let's flip a coin. You win, I walk out that door. You get to shoot her and take the money. I win, it's my gig. Yeah, sure. Better than us blowing the shit out of each other. Yeah, yeah, cool. You call it. Tails. Heads, you lose. Okay that's great, now you do it. What's that? Oops, sorry fella. Very good Murphy, how long did it take you to learn that? Shouldn't you guys be catching criminals or something? Jeez. Yeah, sure. What the hell kinda bonehead move was that, can you tell me? I mean an inch over and you could've killed the woman. Or you could've missed and we would've had a crazed junkie on our hands. Maybe I'm missing something here. I thought I saved a woman's life, he was gonna kill her. Yeah, well she's a mess, she's screaming, she's sobbing, she's a mental case. She'll get over it. Listen, I got a news flash for you, soldier boy, this woman is serious about destroying you. She's hired a sheisty lawyer and is suing the city for 10 million bucks. - For what? - For what? She says you threatened to kill her. In fact, the only thing she could remember was, fuck, I don't believe this but she says you were flipping a coin for the privilege. It wasn't police procedure, I admit that. But I had to do something or we'd both be dead. This may come as a shock to you but there's a reason for police procedures. Now you got lucky but what you did was reckless. As of this moment, you're under suspension pending the results of a hearing before a disciplinary board. I want your gun, your badge and your ID now. - Again? - Again, pal. Let's do it, hurry up. Called by many a hero, Jack Kelly was nonetheless suspended from the force for what the department described as reckless endangerment. Known as Soldier because of his former association with the elite Marine fighting unit the Snake Eaters, Kelly was unavailable for comment. But an eyewitness had this to say. Well, this wild-eyed grease ball comes in. Hello? Officer Jack Kelly? Yeah. Maybe. What's your address? And thank you very much, Mr. Kelly. We will see you then. But that ain't so, I was only joking, you understand? Trying to swallow that crummy burger. Mr. Kelly, I asked you here to discuss something that means a great deal to us. George, would you go get Vivian, please? As I understand it, you're presently under suspension from the police department? Yeah, but it's only a technicality. We're looking for assistance from someone with your qualifications. The good ones or the bad ones? In this case, I think we'd want both. I'd like you to meet our daughter, Vivian. Vivian, this is our friend Mr. Kelly. That's enough, dear. I'm not sure what's going on here. Am I supposed to ignore that or you gonna tell me about it? Our daughter was kidnapped last year. She was working on her Masters at CMU in Sociology. Her thesis was to study the hierarchy of modern tribes, specifically motorcycle gangs. So she found a gang to research and they kidnapped her. There was this gang called the Hell's Fury. They'd planned some outing of some kind, a club ride and a camping trip. They invited Vivian. 10 months later, she returned and she hasn't been the same since. She was 30 pounds underweight, malnourished, anemic. Her mind had been affected, probably from prolonged forced drug abuse. She had a raging case of gonorrhea and since then, we've discovered genital herpes. - How is she now? - Physically better. Mentally, it appears she might never recover. I mean she was used as a sexual object for so long that now she automatically offers herself to any male who approaches her. We want you to find these animals. And when you do, we want you to destroy them. No. I don't do that kinda work. I believe you do, Mr. Kelly. You punish the guilty and that's all we want and that's something the police haven't been able to accomplish yet. All right, let's say I'm willing to give it a shot. I'm not even sure I could find these guys. There's not much to go on. We're willing to pay you. We can talk about that later. Let me know who's around first. From your past exploits, it doesn't seem to concern you whether you bring them in dead or alive. Personally, I prefer dead. It's up to them if they want to die, I'll be in touch. This trance place is right down here. Hey man, you're gonna have to be careful about taking this way out of town, see? 'Cause there's a problem on the road right there. Ignore them, Barret. What kind of problem? Oh well, it's a massive ketchup pileup. And where there's ketchup, there's a burger not far behind. Oh my god, look what they did to the map? Don't worry little lady, Cassie here will clean that right up. Oh my god, Barret, do something. Check please, check please. Oh my god, Barret, do something. Just leave my husband alone. Calm down, calm down. This is the way they do things here. We're not looking for any trouble. Cowboy. Fuck off. Gimme a cold one on tap. - Barret. - Ah, come on, guys. What's fair is fair, I mean I'd let you fuck my wife. But I don't want to fuck, have sex with your wife. Why, what do you got against my wife? She ain't done nothing to you. In fact, she gives pretty good head on account of the fact she ain't got no fuckin' teeth. You pig. Ooh, was that an insult or just a lucky guess. Got a job. I want to work under your PI license. There's something in it for you, man. I just need you to do some legwork for me. When we see a dickhead exposing itself right out in public like this, it's our duty to protect our people from it, right? Glen, you got a rubber? I never used it. So you used to be with the club, right? Think you still have some contacts? What do you think you're doing? Maybe ask around. Maybe I could. First I gotta get a workout. Hey, this one's on me. Well what is your problem, asshole? You. You're an obnoxious scumbag. Glen, get this guy outta my face. You wouldn't hit a girl, would ya? Son of a bitch. Petey, they're playing our song. You disgusting piece of crud. Calm down, dear, let's go. She's got a bit of a temper. My brother's ain't gonna like you kickin' my butt. Hey, I'll take on your brother and the rest of your family. Well, let's get started then. I forgot to tell you, my brother's adopted. So, are you related to Petey here? Nice kid, has a little bit of an attitude problem but he'll probably grow out of it. Go ahead Boog, he insulted our family. Boog? Apologize to Petey. Okay Boog, if that's what it takes. Petey, I'm sorry. I'm sorry you're such a dumb piece of shit. That what you had in mind, big fella? I don't like you. Gimme a break, who wears body armor to a bar? I like to fight. Got any suggestions? - Hit him back. - Too late. Lift your boot. Come on big guy, you wanna race? Come on, I'll give you a head start. You know what your problem is, Boog? Footwork. Yeah, see it's more like this. Now I feel better. Welcome to Cowboy's Private Investigation Service. I'll get you that temporary permit. Be in touch. May I help you, sir? Yep, this might do. It is a beautiful piece, isn't it? Early Victorian of course with a marvelous patina. If you say so, I need a new workbench for my garage. Something with a lot of storage space. I was thinking of putting my tools in these drawers here and the paint and stuff down below there. This piece is original Victorian, sir. Do you think this is strong enough for me to bolt a vice right here and maybe put a bench grinder over here? You know what, what the hell, I'll take it. I'll give you 50 bucks for it. I get it, you're Kelly, aren't you? And you're new, how's a going? She warned me about you. - Is Hildy in the back? - Not anymore. Why don't you take a coffee break? Meeting this lug for the first time can be a little unnerving. What's this? Well will you look at that, McDonald's, circa 1978. Looks like somebody stuck this in the dishwasher and the decals fell off. Peasant. You missed me. Missed does not properly express the emotion. How was your trip? I found a nice 320 blanket chest. Some fair glassware. Any new underwear? If you're lucky, you might find out. Hey, what do you say I cook dinner tonight at my place? What do you say I bring the antacid? I gotta go, I got a new job. Doing what? Some PI work for a family. Outlaw bikers kidnapped and raped their daughter. Oh, that sounds dangerous. I worry about you. You just worry about getting yourself and that new underwear over to my place tonight. Okay. - See ya. - Bye. I could get my ass in a sling over this. You're under suspension, man. If Durkee walks by, you're just visiting. Just visiting, whatever you say, man. Hey, we were always close. You always hated my guts. It's never too late to change. Enough with the bullshit. You know, when I saw the girl, I never thought we should close the file on this one. But hey, I'm an Indian, not a Chief, so here's the dope. Vivian Molison contacted a local bike gang, the Hell's Fury. She traveled with them on a weekend to Copper Lake. On Monday, the bikers returned without Vivian. Of course, the Hell's Fury swear up and down that she returned safe and sound, went on her own way. All we could find out was that their leader, a local thug named Guts Holman was screwing the girl. What does he have to say about it? Not too much, he's dead. Although he probably doesn't know it yet. Dumb son of a bitch had an IQ of about 12. Murder? He was killed the day after they came back from the trip. His Harley came out second-best in an argument with a cement truck. Our only hope for an ID was Vivian but 10 months later when she turned up on the side of a road in Renfield County, the best we could get out of her was a bunch of incoherent bullshit. What the hell was she doing way the hell out there in Renfield County? That's over 100 miles from here. Rico. It's for you, don't they know you don't work here anymore? Don't worry, I told Hanley I was only visiting. Yeah? - Thank God I found you. Vivian's missing. George and I were out back in the garden and when I went inside to look for Vivian, I saw her getting into a truck out front. It was a moving van with a white star on the side. By the time George got to the car, it had disappeared. All right, calm down, Mrs. Molison. I'll make a pass of all the motels in the area, we might get lucky. A moving van with a star on it can't be that hard to find. If I don't turn up anything, we're gonna have to go to the police. Yeah, bye. You're welcome. Who the hell are you? What do you want? I've come for the girl. Now kindly dismount and offer her your most sincere apology. Who are you, her boyfriend? No, I'm a friend of the family's. I didn't force the girl here. I just stopped and asked for directions, this was her idea. Now if you want to stick around and give her a lift home, that's fine with me. But haul up the door and wait outside. You don't understand, this girl has a problem. I'm touched, now pull up the door and get outta here or I'll put your fucking head through it. I'm not leaving without the girl. You're dog meat. This won't take long, kid. Would you mind putting on your underwear first? You're not exactly my type. Thank you. Now listen to me, man. She's... - Fuck you. Are you okay? Did he hurt you. No, he's all right. Why don't you get dressed? I'll take you home, I'll wait for you outside. Don't you want to fuck me? No. I want you to let me take you home. I thought you might have gotten a better offer. That'll never happen, just a long day at the office. The ribs okay? - I don't know how you do it? - What? Well, a new job, running around all day and you still have time to prepare my favorite dinner. You're a catch. Yeah, I taught Murray everything he knows about ribs. I'll put 'em in the oven. I just lost my appetite. Cold, very cold. It's hopeless, the man claims he misses me but can't find one lousy zipper. I'm just having a little fun at your expense. Some detective. I know, but it doesn't come off. It's a good thing this wasn't an emergency. Bingo. Yeah? I could have taken a shit in the time it took you to get here. Come in. - You got company? - Not anymore. I've been asking around. One of the Hell's Fury women wants to split up with her old man. The way I hear it, she's not into that greasy Levis, vroom vroom shit anyway. But it's tough to walk out on one of these sleazoids. Especially when his name is Goose. She's been bad-mouthing him. You might get something out of her. Is that it? You're lucky to have gotten anything. Oh now, don't get touchy, I'm just asking. Her name's Fran Zephredi, she works at a topless joint. The Dewdrop down in Industrial and that's it. Oh yeah, here's your temp permit. Good stuff Cowboy, put yourself on the payroll. And they said I was unemployable. You got something cold with a bottle? Yeah, that's cool. Five bucks. Five bucks for a beer? Entertainment charge. Oh, how ignorant of me. You seen Fran around? I could have. Hi, how are you doing today, honey? Not too bad. I sure liked your dance. How about buying the lady a drink? Yeah, sure. How about a beer? I think the lady prefers champagne. Better yet pal, when you spot the wine steward, tell him I want to see the wine list. In the meantime, how about a beer? Chuck, a beer will be fine. Hey, I haven't seen you around here before. I'm Jack Kelly, I'm a friend of Vivian Molison's. I can't talk about that right now. Yeah, that's cool. The love of your life? Pain in my ass. Hey, Franny. Don't you say hello no more? Hello, Goose. Hey Clyde, how's a going? You having a good time slobbering all over Franny's tits? I think he means that as a compliment. Okay Clyde, your time's up. Give somebody else a chance to score with old Franny rotten crotch. You better take off. I just want to ask you a few more questions. Hey Goose, did you get that name by sticking your thumb up your ass or somebody else's? Hey man, Goose doesn't have a sense of humor. He should, he's pretty damn funny looking. Funny? Funny when I pull out your eye and skull-fuck you. And he's clever, witty and charming too. Now are you gonna fuck off or am I gonna have to dance all over that head of yours? The only thing you're gonna do is die and like it. I guess that means you're not gonna fuck off, huh? So let's step outside and get this over with. All right, asshole, follow me. Hey Kelly, you got some kind of a death wish? Don't worry, this'll only take a minute. Nice, it's reserved parking, huh? Yeah well you know, us bros got privileges and it's gonna be my privilege to rip your head off. But you're lucky because I gotta take a leak. My kidneys ain't worth a damn. Goose, I don't think I could stand here and watch you take a piss. I'll wait for you around the corner. Hey, hero, if you try to run, I might decide to hurt you real bad. Look, I'll be right back, okay? Just call out when you're done. Ah shit, cocksucker. That's mister cocksucker to you. Whoa whoa, wait a minute, you said we were gonna have a fair fight. You've never had a fair fight in your life, Goose. Come to think of it, neither have I. My bike, what are you, fuckin' crazy? You're dead meat. - Hey. I've got the gun, remember? What's your problem? Franny ain't worth all this. If she means that much to you, why don't you go in there and get laid? Man, what are you, fuckin' crazy? This isn't about Fran. I want to know about Vivian Molison. Man, I've never heard of her. Goddammit. You shot me. Of course I shot you. You're an offensive asshole and you're lying to me. Your memory get any better yet? All right, all right, I remember Vivian Molison. Guts was humping her, nothing serious man, that's it. You'd sound awful good singing soprano. I think maybe you oughta try real hard to remember the answer to my next question which is why did Vivian Molison show up a vegetable 10 months after Guts died? Huh? All right man, he sold the bitch. Sold her, sold her to who? It was on the road, he sold her to a gang of bikers just passing through. I swear man, I never saw 'em before. He sold her? Sold her. Wait, whoa, whoa, hey, hey. Ain't you gonna give me a ride to the hospital? Jesus Christ. Come on Goose, you're a Hell's Fury, remember? You guys are supposed to be tough, huh? You ride big motorcycles, you beat and humiliate your women and you were gonna kick the shit out of me, remember? So show a little dignity, stop whining. I could've shot you in the balls. You're alive, what happened to Goose? He fell off his motorcycle. Those things are dangerous, you know that? So I hear. Look, Goose is gonna be lookin' for somebody to blame this on, okay? I think it might be a good idea if you stayed low for a couple of days. You've gotta be joking. First of all, if I leave this place, I'll get fired and second, he knows where I live. So I think I'll just stick it out. Hey Fran, my girlfriend has an apartment. There's plenty of room. - Look. I've been living like a retarded junior high schooler for eight years. Now I'm finally trying to get my life together. Please keep me out of this. I'm afraid you're already in this. So what really happened to Goose? I ran over his motorcycle. And? And I shot him in the foot. Wait for me, I'll be dressed in five minutes. This is gonna be great, just like sisters. Kelly, may I speak with you in the kitchen, please? Now what do you think you're doing? What happened to "I never bring my work home." Hildy, the poor girl's looking for a fresh start. Now her life's in jeopardy and it's my fault. That I don't doubt. It's just for a couple of days. Kelly. I was feeling, you know, sexy tonight. Yeah? Obviously this is a problem, just take me home. Wait, Hildy hasn't said no yet. No, I just had to realize that Kelly has decided on celibacy as a lifestyle. She's weakening. It's only for a few days. We'll find Fran a new job and a new place to work. Yeah, in the meantime, what am I supposed to do about money? Well you can clean while Hildy's at work and it pays 40 bucks a day, room and board. Soldier? Don't worry, I'm springing for it. Is he like this often? Too often. Yeah? Yeah, hold on. Hey Turk, long distance for you. - Fuck it. - He says it's important. Cocksucker. Yeah? You waking me up for this? The girl's a veggie and I know you ain't gonna put the make on me. What's the big fuckin' deal? This guy don't have shit on us. Watch that, that's cold. That's good. Hey yo, why don't you stay and hang out the rest of the afternoon? I mean your guy can watch the store. Give me one good reason. Here's one. Yeah, that's one. How about one more? Number two, comin' up. Oh Kelly, you are so naughty. Go away Goose, I'll call the cops. Hey come on, I just want to talk. I got nothin' to say. I got no problem with you, Franny. We had some real good times together and I don't like this shit, you hiding out. So what do you want? I just want to talk. You used to be my old lady and I miss you. Come on baby, open the door. There's no way I'm opening the door, Goose. No problem, I'll just let myself in. On second thought baby, I didn't feel like talking anymore. Well, you certainly know how to convince a girl to play hooky. And this is only the seventh inning stretch. Hello, Kelly's ballpark. No, I don't want her involved, this is my problem. What is it? Something's come up. You stay here, I'll call you later. I'm sorry Fran, you never had a chance. You don't have to be a mind-reader to figure out who did this. Come on Soldier, gimme a break, who should I arrest? You can start with a fat slob named Goose. What should I arrest him for? For being a slob? - Murder. Come on Durkee, this guy's no angel. You could find enough on him to at least call him in. You get him quick enough, he still might have powder traces on him. Soldier, don't tell me how to do my job. Homicide will conduct a thorough investigation. If your man Goose is the perp, we'll find out about it. Just like you found out who turned Vivian Molison into a vegetable, right? Hey Soldier, don't let me catch you and Roy Rogers playing Sherlock Holmes on this case. Durkee, do you have a problem with Roy Rogers? It's just an expression. An expression for what? You know, an expression for a cowboy. Oh, so you're talkin' about me. Hey, get this Cowboy outta my face. What are you so uptight about? It's only an expression, I mean what's with this guy? It's cool, you lame piece of shit. What? It's just an expression. Goose sure didn't waste any time finalizing his divorce. That's one mean dude, someone should take that sucker out. Maybe it's payback time. You know where he lives? Yep. Goddammit. Howdy, partner. What do you want, Cowboy? Hey, I was in the neighborhood. Thought you might like to toss back a few. Yeah, well I hear you're into that private investigative shit now. Yeah well, I miss the boys. I've been thinking of saddling up hog and riding again. Besides, it don't make a lot of sense to be trackin' down runaways when you can't be screwin"em. Ain't that the truth, bro, come on in. So I tell this faggot peach fuzzer I ain't paying for no gas. In fact, you owe me money, you ungrateful shit. He says "What do I owe you for?" Hell, I take the grease gun and tell the fucker he's gonna get a lube top, Hell's Fury style. I'll bet his ass was shaking like a dog shitting peach pits. Yeah, his ass was shaking all right. For a little shit, you can sure put it away, Cowboy. Yeah, well I was wondering where you're puttin' it all. It's a funny thing, when I was at the hospital gettin' my foot fixed, I told 'em about my pissing trouble. They gave me these here pills. I hardly even have to go at all. Go ahead, take a piss if you want. No, I don't have to go, you go ahead, partner. How about doing some shots? Yeah sure, sounds great. I'll get the tequila. But first, I gotta take a piss. More than one way to cook a Goose. One more minute, I'd a been gargling. Let's check him out. I already did. You must've raised the water table around here at least a foot. Hey hold on, Goose had a cellular. Here's a number. Let's see who he's been shootin' the shit with. Look Hil, I didn't think it was gonna come to this. But these guys have raised the ante, it could get rough. I don't know if I can go on with you getting constantly mixed up in this kind of violence. Yeah? Gotcha. What is it? Oh, just some company. Someone's coming up? No, we're going down, take a look, what do you see? Shit. There's two bikers and one just waved at me. Okay Hil, we gotta get outta here, all right? I'm staying here, okay? You go do whatever it is you have to do. Just leave me out of it. I have had enough of your cops and robbers bullshit. Hil, I can't leave you out of it. Why don't we just call the police? And what would they do? Get us outta here alive, that's what. Maybe but they can't arrest these guys 'cause they haven't done anything yet, okay? Soon as the cops leave, they'll be back again. Kelly, can I ask you a question before I do whatever it is you suggest I do next? Yes. Why do I listen to you? Why do I get the feeling that's gonna change after tonight? What's next, honey, I'm scared to death. Don't worry, you'll forget about it when things start to happen. - How comforting. - Just stay behind me. - Okay, yeah. - And no matter what happens or what I do, don't touch or grab me. "Why don't you come "stay with me for a couple of days? "You'll be safe." Hold it right there, boys. You packin', hand 'em over. Hey man, we don't got a beef with you. We were just helping a friend. Can I kill 'em? Let 'em go. Shit, you had all the fun. You boys are just lucky my partner's got a soft spot for grease balls. Whoa, what do you know? I better work on this here hair trigger, it's a might touchy. Now you boys better skedaddle outta here before it goes off again and blows your fuckin' balls off. He tried to kill me, he tried to kill me. Nailed the number two Hell's Fury, they call him Frog. Yeah, well it looks like the Frog just croaked. It's a gut shot, Soldier, time's a might low. You got a name? Sam, Sam Credley. You just got shot in the stomach with a 45, Sam. You're gonna die, you know that, don't you? Oh man. - Does it hurt? - Yeah. It's bad, real bad. Well I'm sure as hell happy about that. - Where to, hoss? - Hildy's. You mean to tell me they found two bikers dead on my sidewalk, the sidewalk in front of my building? Yeah, two Hell's Fury bikers not to mention your man Goose who they found fried in his bathroom a couple days ago. Yeah, I read about that. A real tragedy. You know Kelly, you expect me to believe with all this shit going down outside your front door that you know dick about it, huh? Oh wait a sec, come to think of it, I did hear something. It sounded like the sound of a truck backfiring. Two guys get gunned down and you think you hear a truck backfiring? What can I say, Durkee? It was a big truck. Hey, don't fuck with me man, I'm in no mood. So who were they? Walter Gribbit and Sam Credley. Doesn't ring a bell, wait a minute, Gribbit? Gribbit? Yeah, you know the guy? No, it kinda sounds like the name of a frog though, don't it? These bikers are real clever. Very funny, people are dying, I'm trying to find out why and you're dickin' me around! Durkee, an innocent college girl was kidnapped and then raped by a gang of bikers. A woman minding her own business is murdered by another one and you're worried about a biker war? Gimme a break. Wait a minute, Kelly. It makes me proud to be a cop. Relax, hoss. I checked out Goose's cellular. It seems like he's not the real chatty type. He only made six calls last week. Three of those were to a pizza place which if I don't miss my guess is a drug drop. Two to Franny in the Dewdrop but one stands out like a horse's dick. The day after you popped that slob in the ankle, he called Crestridge 120 miles north of here. That's in Renfield County, that's where the Molison girl turned up. That's right, the phone's a cellular registered to a guy name McCready. And of course you checked out the number. Well of course, when I asked him if he knew a man named Goose, he was one tough hombre that told me to talk the phone and stick it where the sun don't shine. Let's pay him a visit. I thought you'd want to. Let's stop at my place and pick up a few things. Mr. Kelly, thank God. I've been calling you for two hours and then I didn't know what to do, so I just came here. - What happened? - Vivian's gone. We didn't see her leave, she just disappeared. Okay, don't panic yet. She still may be wandering around somewhere. But you better call the cops. The last time, we were looking for a distinctive truck. This time, we can use all the help we can get. Mr. Kelly, I don't want to lose her again. Call the police, ask for Sergeant Gomez. He owes me one. Tell him to check all the motels and hotels in your area first, okay? Don't worry, we'll find her. Yep, I'd say in a pretty town like this, outlaw bikers oughta stand out like a Great Dane's balls. As a God-fearing family man, I feel sick to my stomach when I hear about these animals ruining people's lives. I will do anything in my power to help. You have any idea why Goose may have called your number? No, not really. It could've been a wrong number. Mr. Kelly, I have 12 sales agents and each one of them has a cellular registered to my name. Now, I haven't a clue why this man Goose might be calling one of my men. But still, if one of my people cursed you out, I want to hear about it. We don't put up with that sort of thing around here. Maybe one of your fancy phones was stolen. No. Got any bikers hanging around here? One or two pass through but this town don't put up with those types. They soon move on, they don't stay long. Well we really appreciate your time, Mr. McCready. It's gettin' late, so I think we're gonna stick around. We'll get to you in the morning. Good idea, you boys got a place to stay? No. Well, this isn't exactly a hub of commerce or tourism. Your best bet would be the Crestview Court, straight through town, you can't miss it. It's clean and it's got color TV. I'm glad you're feeling better, Hild. Hey don't worry, it was self-defense. Sure, I'll check in with Durkee when I get back. Oh that, it's some people next door watching a game show. At least they could be having wild sex or something worth listening to. Look, we'll be wrapping up our business here in the morning. Don't worry, I'm always careful. I love you, bye. I ain't gonna listen to this crap all night. Shut the damn thing off, I can't take this shit no more. Hey, what's your problem, man? The TV, lower it or you're gonna be watching it from inside the tube, partner. Sorry man, I didn't know it was so loud. These walls are pretty thin. Yeah. I'll remember that when I blow my nose. I don't think I'm gonna catch any Z's at this place. Try to relax, Cowboy, think of something that'll calm you. Like kicking the shit out of Hulk Hogan. Who the hell is Hulk Hogan? Hey, this loud enough for you? Hey, we're leaving now. Now that's more like it. Cowboy. I hear 'em. I think they're planning the next move. I'll check out back. The back's covered, we got at least one automatic. I can't find my stuff, you seen my boots? These boys are serious, hoss. Yes. You got a plan? Let's see how thin this wall really is, keep 'em honest. You must be a couple of crispy mother fuckers by now. You got a problem? No, no, you look great. Listen, we gotta keep moving. This whole place is gonna go up. Let's make a door. I guess they're leaving but look who threw the party. What do you want? This is a hell of a way to go visiting. We came by to thank you for your little visit to our motel tonight. Oh well, it's not what you think. You see this gun in my hand. You're lucky I'm holding it because my partner's really pissed off. See, he doesn't like his new clothes and his boots just got dirty. So maybe I'll just give the gun to him. No, don't shoot me. What do you want? We want to know why you tried to kill us. I didn't, I was just passing by. I stopped to watch. I didn't know those guys were... You know what, we're gonna make this look like a thrill killing, huh? Yeah. Like a psycho did it. I told you boys, I didn't know those guys were coming after you. - Then why'd you run? - I was scared. Well McCready, this kind of thing is always so messy. All right, all right. They were just supposed to scare you off. They weren't supposed to go that far. They said you would ask questions. Your man Goose phoned their leader, Turk. He uses one of my cellular numbers. So what's your connection? They work for me, they're doing odd jobs. Odd jobs, like what, like a little muscle to help close a real estate deal? Maybe get some better prices on some properties? Yes, yeah, something like that. Where's Turk now? At the club 15 miles north of here off the Swamp Road. Thanks. I think we oughta whack that sucker for real. Nah. Probably a lot of people'd thank us. You're a real humanitarian, Cowboy. How long you gonna hold on to her? As long as I feel like it. Then what, are you gonna kill her? She's already dead. She just spreads 'em wide and I go for the ride. Better than a fuckin' roller coaster, eh? Go fuckin' get her! Shit, that's the Molison girl. Those bastards have taken her again. We've gotta get her out. My count, there's 10 bikes. There's only the two of us. That place looks harder to crack than the Alamo. What's wrong, skinny mama? You're not happy here with old Turk anymore? That holiday you spent at home sorta spoiled ya. Well we'll soon fix that. I got me an idea. What are you gonna do, steal a rocket launcher? You'll see. While you're busy, I'll do my best to cut down the odds. Here, hold this. What are you up to, one of your old jungle tricks? A little something the Vietcong used to do to our guys in 'Nam. Let's roll. Have fun, partner. Dixon, go ahead and call Cready. Find out what the word is on the fire. Maybe we got spotted. I'd like to have seen the look on those boys faces when them bottles started flying in. It's too bad they nailed old Ox though, poor fuck. He was walking in there like a welcoming committee. The dumb fuck was asking for it. Yeah, but you hate to see it when a bro gets it. Well where we planted him out back, he's got plenty of company. So where the hell is Dixon? What, is he screwing around? No, he's dead. Hey asshole. Come and get it. Who the hell is that? Come on, you scumbag. Let's finish what you started last night. That's fuckin' impossible. Get that turd, bring him in here! Button everything up. Get the guns. Cowboy, now I know why I pay you the big bucks. Let's do it, partner, I'll drive. I was gonna suggest that, seeing as I'm the better shot. Woo ha! Here they come, blow the fuckers away. Kill the fuckers. They're still coming. They're fuckin' crazy. Bad day to go hunting. So long, asshole. We got problems, dynamite, it's gonna blow. Get the truck, now. Would $5,000 suffice, Mr. Kelly? No. But a bag of those tomatoes should cover it. That's very generous of you, Mr. Kelly. How is your associate? Oh Cowboy, yeah, he's really ticked off. He's not fond of getting shot. The transformation in Vivian is amazing. We can't thank you enough. Mr. Kelly. I'm sorry you hurt your arm. You should've seen the other guy. Thank you. How'd we do, hoss? Here's your share, partner. Well, where are we off to now? Why don't we go over and raise Lieutenant Durkee's blood pressure?
