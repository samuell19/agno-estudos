Where the hell are you hiding? Come on out, ghost or whatever you are! You scared of me or what? Did you run out of tricks, huh? Let's go head to head. All right, let's put an end to this today. Either you die or I die! What's with this guy? Is he crazy? You wanna play games with me? Come out! I know you're here! Let's finish it! Come out, now! How come he's isn't afraid! I'm gonna get you, ass! You think you're scary? What a joke! Next time you're gonna have to do a whole lot better, got it? Wanna try strangling me again? I'd rather watch a scaring movie than see you! I'm gonna teach you a lesson! A lesson about what? What's it this time? Man, you're really something! You did this to the couch the other night, remember? What a hopeless girl you are! All right already! If doing this make you happy, go ahead. I can't believe this! Who's at the door? Don't ask me! What are you filming horror movie or something? What's with the costume? It's too bad. All that effort for nothing! Who is it? Answer me! You, PARK Pil-gi! How come you haven't called me for a week? Well... I was just... Are you hiding something. No way! You know me. Your girl is pissed off! - I'm on vacation starting today. - Oh, you are? Hon, Soo-kyung, wait! Oh, she's turned on so easily! Please have her keep her shirts on! You're lucky! Look at her ass! She's dying to have sex. Never mind me, just have fun! Oh, please, no... I saw you two doing it the other day. You're a crack at it! I'm soaking in sweat, pull the covers off. - No, If you do I'll... - All right, goddamn. Soo-kyung, no more, please. I told you, stop! Forget it then. I'm going home. Hey, I am sorry, Soo-kyung. Sorry, don't get the wrong idea. It's not what you're thinking. Open the door, honey. Don't take it the wrong way. This is killing me! Open the door. Let's talk about it, okay? Soo-kyung, honey... I'm really sorry. Calm down. You're so pretty! Oh, my angel! What's this? Oh, I get it. Since when have you seen me wearing red panties? So you've been with some other bitch in this house! No, it's all a misunderstanding. You've cheated on me, damn! Listen to me! - It's not how it looks! - Then what is it? Just calm down! You said you loved me, and so how do you explain this shit! Wait, please listen to me. This is so irritating! Damn! I can't believe this. You bastard, we're finished. Soo-kyung! I'll kill you... Yon-wha! Yon-wha? That's the bitch's name, damn! - She's an LG. - An LG? What's that? There're 2 kinds of ghosts... One is an LG, meaning 'Lingering Ghost'... who can't leave the place that they lived before for some reason. And the 2nd one is an FG, meaning 'Floating Ghost'. And the one in your house is an LG. Are you serious? All right then, tell me how to deal with this LG, FG or whatever. First you have to listen to her story about what makes her linger around the house. And then? You weren't able to win the fight against the ghost, so... Now it's time to negotiate. Whether human beings or ghosts, communication is key. None of you can imagine how I feel! You don't know how I feel... I didn't do anything. Hello, please sit. How cruel! He needs to learn a lesson anyway. Why are you so late? Well, today is KIM's memorial day. So we had a meeting at his house. Have you drunk a lot already? We just started. Hey, let me pour you one. Today it's on this boy, so feel free to have as much as you want. Hey, I didn't say that. We're splitting it. You didn't really help anyway. "Need a conversation"? An idiot could've said that! Okay, I'm gonna give it a try. But what do we talk about? What the...! Are you a bat or something? It's embarrassing to see you doing this crap! You're blushing! I bet, you must've been practicing all day to surprise me! Not really. Listen, give it rest and let's talk it out. I don't want to. Can you call this 'ghost's self respect'? Come down, already. So tell me, what is it that you want me to do? That's simple. Get out of MY house. You're definitely confused. It's MY house. You wanna see the contact? Or, if you go to the registration office, you'll see that the owner's PARK Pil-gi. - This is MY house, period. - Is it? Then convince me that it is! I don't need to. Just stuff you face pig. What? Watch your mouth. You don't have any idea how to show respect? You started it, jerk. Jerk? You're really pushing my buttons. I'll kill you! You think I'm scared? What an idiot, I'm already dead! Crazy ghost! The negotiation's finished! That's it! I'm not making any concessions! I've never heard of such a lousy ghost! Stop eating! I paid for this! She's not worth giving a try. What's her story? She just kept saying "This is MY house". And she's sharp with cursing and swearing. She must've lived a terrible life! - And she's even worse than you! - What the f...! All you do is talk about patience and communication. Sir, this isn't exactly in accordance with the designs. Take it easy, it's perfect. What the...! She must want revenge or something, right? Whatever, I don't give a shit. I'm not scared any more. Then find a way for you to live together. Ghosts are friendlier than humans, in a way. It's not time for joking. Rumors are going around that my house is haunted. A TV station even called me to cover the story. Nothing happened? NO ghosts? That's unbelievable! You look good. Hey, kid, slow down on the sweets. Who're you talking to? You have a younger sister who died, right. Yeah! - She's sitting right there. - Where? What's your name? Sook-ja? Sook-ja, right? Right! She's sitting there feasting on chocolates. Hey, sweets can spoil your teeth, so slow down, okay. Oh my dear sister. You got a habit of spying on girls taking baths? Who me? What are you talking about? I'm no pervert! My husband will come home any day now, so... It makes me sick. Even a ghost changes dresses? So funny! This really pisses me off. You take a bath almost every day. Think about the water bill I pay. You don't ever pay a cent of that. You just idle away time having fun. And you don't even consider the living costs! Don't you have any moral ethics? What's the use of taking a bath if you're a goddamn ghost? According to the project number 60385's plan, we should... Hello, this is PARK Pil-gi. That's right... You wanna buy the house? Sure, and you've already seen it? Then why don't we do the paper work tomorrow? Don't worry a thing about how much over the market price it is. It would've been so much better if you all moved out of these shacks earlier. Fuck, I'm fed up with this worthless shits. Just sign the contract, now! I don't have time forever! Hurry up dammit! Hey. You gotta stop popping up out of nowhere like this. What are you doing? What's this? Give me that. Do I have to report every single thing I do to you? None of your damn business. I'm just... Just what? I'm... I'm moving out. So you should pack up your things, if you got any. They're going to build something here. - What did you say? - I'm moving out. And they're going to demolish this house? Well... they're going to get rid of the house and build a hotel. It'll be nice. You can wait for your husband in a brand new hotel. No! I'm sorry. I understand. No way! He was my first and only true love in the 28 years of my life. And this house was our dream. It was everything. Congratulation on your wedding! Sorry for such a small wedding. What're you talking about? I couldn't be happier. I'd be so happy living in a house like this. - You mean it? - Of course. This is... OUR house. I was going to tell you once it was finished, but... Lunch break, come and eat. - It's great. - Hurry up. I'm starving. I love this house. When the house is finished, let's take a trip. A trip? It's been three years and we still haven't gone on a real honeymoon, so... Really? But you know I don't mind. - All right, never mind then. - No, let's go! What luck, a typhoon hitting during our honeymoon. I'm so sorry! It's fine. I like sound of rain, and besides you're with me. Let's eat. - Well, we have a house now and so... - So...? I want to have a baby. Thanks, honey. What's going on? Hey, driver! What's happening? Hurry, give me the stretcher. Hurry! Hurry up, we're losing her! Mister, can you help me find my husband? Oh, please... Gi-tae! Hurry, move. If this house is gone...? Please don't let this gone, what happens to my husband? I'm begging you. You can sell it, but this house has to be here. I sincerely sympathize with you, but there's nothing I can do. Don't cry. And how can you be so sure you're husband will come? If he were alive, he'd have come earlier. If he were dead, he'd have come as a ghost like you. I'm sure that he's coming dead or alive. So don't sell it to this company. What should I do? Only if I could see him... just once! Then I'd be happy and move on. You've got to be kidding. You said yes over the phone! You want more for it, is that it? I'll pay 10 million more. It's got nothing to do with the price. I just changed my mind, that's all. Sorry, but try to find somewhere else. I'll be going. Well, we've got a problem. We've already made a contract with the hotel owner. Rude son of a bitch! PARK Gi-tae... No? He's not on the obituaries, so he couldn't have been on the bus. He was on the bus I bet, and how could he have not come, if he's alive! Please have a look at it again. Does that mean you know one of the survivors who were on the bus? Well, yes and no... Is it possible this record is wrong? Well to be honest, I would say yes. In cases like this, victims are taken to ER's all over the place, and sometimes information can get mixed up. And I wasn't in charge of it, so... What should I do? Come this way. You little brat! Come down from there, come on. Hurry up, and come down. I didn't do it, I swear. It's mean to play tricks on people. Did you see the mess you caused at the police station? I don't know what happened to you, but this isn't right. You might be having fun, but it causes people a lot of trouble. You belong to the ghost world and you can't interfere here. Yes, sir. Don't do it again. Promise? Good boy, now go home. - Good- bye. - See you, kid. I asked all the ghosts around, but... no one knows where he is. He's not listed on the obituaries. He could be hanging around the accident site, waiting for his wife? The accident site? Some ghosts just hang around the place where they died. He could be waiting for his wife to show up. PARK Gi-tae, if you're here, come out. I wanna see you. I'm looking for Gi-tae, Yon-wha's husband. PARK Gi-tae. What's he doing here? Is he looking for any of us? Hello, guys! You can see us? Are you a shaman? No, not really. But I'm here to find a ghost. PARK Gi-tae... wasn't he the one sitting behind me? I haven't seen him for 2 years. No, that ghost went after a girl who was here for a picnic. Is it that guy who was sleeping in the back seat? Was it him? No, he was sitting with a lady, his wife. Then could it be the couple sitting in the middle? I remember we had to wait, 'cause the man came back late from the rest area. No, I was sitting in the middle, and I didn't see any couple. How do you know? Yu were changing seats all the time, looking for the most comfortable one. How selfish! Selfish? Me? Calm down. I was reading a newspaper. Hello... what? Hold on. Hey, keep it down. I told you, I won't sell the house. No negotiations, period. Are you threatening me? It's my house, and I won't sell it! So what? Don't think you can threaten me, shit! Mind your own business! Line up just like the night of the accident! - Sir... I am af... - Shut up. What if the ghost is here? Don't worry a thing. Even a ghost wouldn't dare attack me. Hurry up, moron. Over there. Hurry up. Make sure to hit the kitchen too. What are you doing? No! Did you hear that? Hear what? Stop standing there and finish the job. No! Get the hell out of here. Oh, no! Get out! Hurry! Dad. Dad... I'm happy you got yourself such a beautiful house, sorry I'm late. No, that's all right. Dad, I missed you so much. Don't worry, this house has a strong frame, so all you'll have to do is remodel. It's time to say good-bye. I wish you and your new family happiness. And Yon-wha, get along with my son, all right? Let's take a look. It would've been disastrous if the fire spread to the woods. I'm sorry to see your house so damaged. You should've sold the house when you could've gotten more for it. See what stupid decisions lead to. By the way, I know it's terrible timing, but there some bad news. - Is that right? - Yeah. This is to inform you that this house addressed at 43 Jangsungop was not built in accordance with Art. 9 and 12 of the construction regulation. In accordance with Art. 69 of these regulations, this house is ordered to be demolished. One last thing. It takes effects as of today. Considering that the fire here today violated the law... not to mention that it is haunted, it's best if this house is demolished. I don't give a shit. I'm going to keep this house no matter what. You officials are taking bribes, right? Watch your mouth. - Get the hell out of here. - PARK Pil-gi! All right, but let me tell you something. I've been in this fucking business for 20 years. Remember, I'm one of the top 10 bastards in this country for demolishing houses, right? You think you win a war against me? If you walk away now, I'll pay for your moving expenses, but otherwise, you're done for. Got it? The deadline is midnight. You think... this is going to help? It will! I'm willing to risk my life protecting this house. Don't worry, I'll make sure nothing happens. How about... giving the house up. What? I don't want you to get hurt, my husband may not come. That's enough. Just talk with the man who wants this house, and you'll... I'll what? I'll do or get what? I'll never give up this house. It's MY house. And YOUR house... too. Hey, I don't want you to get hurt. Just walk away. Cut the bullshit. God dammit! That jerk's a real pain in the ass! Sorry, asshole, you want this house? Then come and get it. Don't hold back. Just do what you got to do. - Go! - Yes, sir. Tear it down, now! Crush it. Tear to pieces. Come on, man! The cute girl in red shoes will leave. Now, let's move. One more song, please. Fuck! Put the fire out. Hurry. Be careful, the house might catch on fire! Don't worry I used to be pitcher at school. So I helped friends throw firebombs at demonstrations. You see, just trust me. What are you doing standing around anyway? I'm helpless out of this house. The only time I actually need your powers, and you can't help. His father dying wish was for him to have his own house. So this boy worked like hell to buy a house, and he finally made it. But, as fate would have it the house is haunted. And, as it turns out, that house was everything to the ghost and her husband, but when the house was completed, she died and her husband went missing on the first and only trip they ever took. And she has been there... She yearns to find out what happened to her husband... and forever waits there for his return. But a greedy contractor is determined to demolish the house any time! We have two choices, we can stay here and enjoy our songs... Or rush to aid of those poor kids. They're resisting like hell! In the end, there's nothing he do. Tear it down! Yes, sir. No! Hey? I can't hold on much longer. Get out! Let's go, hurry. Hurry, it's getting more dangerous! - I can't believe this. - That's strong concrete. This can't be happening. There's no way! Ram it harder. What's wrong with this? It's ghosts. - Something's going on! - Evil spirits. Come down you bastard! Are you all right? There's nothing to be afraid of. Just do your job, men. Pil-gi. Oh, sir. I am not too late, am I? The house was almost done for! Just do what you came to do! All out attack! Attack. It's nothing. Stand your ground. What took you so long? We almost lost everything. Fuck, what are you doing? Snap out of it you assholes! No, this can't be happening. Are you all possessed or something? You won't believe what I had to do to get the ghosts support force here. That bastard! Don't lay a finger on it! This is my house! - Are you Yon-wha? - Yes? I heard someone call your name desperately at the hospital! What? I don't know if he's still there, but... The man next to my room, called out "Yon-wha" a lot. Excuse me, is there a patient PARK Gi-tae registered here? Well... not sure, just a moment. It works. Great, it's walking fine. We'll carry this bear with Yon-wha in it. - No, it won't. - Why not? She won't be able to survive in it long. A woman's body would be the best for this. It was perfect. Who is it? Soo-kyung? What's going on? Are you okay? I was worried to death! Come on in. The bastards did this! Why didn't you call me? My boss JANG helped me out so everything was okay. Isn't that right? I didn't do much, but he's really lucky. What if the jerks come back to get revenge? No way! He was thrown in jail for fraud and forging official documents! I feel terrible, look at this! Nothing's left. We are going to have to start all over again. And it's going to take a lot of money, right? Well, what's done is done, so we'll just have to save up. We should have that jerk compensate us for the costs! What? What was that? Nothing. What're you talking about? I felt something. What? Do you feel a pain in your back or something? I know there's something going on that you're not telling me about. I don't know what you're talking about. Pil-gi, just tell her the truth and ask her to help. Soo-kyung is too strong willed so... it won't work unless she's willingly supportive. Hey, you'd better tell me the truth. This way. What? Why not? Do you have any idea what time it is? Come back tomorrow. We can't come back tomorrow. I need to see him today. You can't talk to her like that. Let's just come back tomorrow. It doesn't seem possible tonight. You've waited so long, what's another day? I've waited so long already, I can't wait any more minute. I have my reasons, so please make an exception this time. What's more, he's in intensive care, only family can see him. I sure he doesn't have any family, so how are you related? He's my husband. I'm his wife. Security? Come to the front desk. Run. Where are you going? - Let's go up this way. - What? - We have no other choice! - No, Yon-wha. You know how much I'm afraid of heights. Fine, I'll go by myself. - Hey, come down! - Oh my god. Are you all right? I can't believe it! Are you all right? I told you not to do it. Your body's that of a 60-year-old man, JANG, don't forget it. - Pil-gi, you go. - What? - Hurry. - No I won't. I'm telling you to go! - I told you this was a bad idea! - Grab his hands tight! It's him, right? Is it him? Oh, Gi-tae... Are you all right, sir? Honey, at last I'm here. So, this is why you couldn't come home. Sorry, I'm so late. I should've looked for you earlier. I'm gonna get the... why? I couldn't let go, thinking that you might come back to me some day. And now, everything's fine. Nothing matters anymore, we're together again. I wouldn't be here if it weren't for my friends. How can I ever thank you? It was our pleasure Please find a good place to rest. Thank you I'll never forget what you've done for us. Are you PARK Pil-gi? We're terrified. This ghost or monster whatever it is, is killing us! It's an LG. An LG? It's one of two kinds of ghosts, and LG means 'Lingering Ghost'... It's kind of technical, I'll brief you when I get the job done. Have some cold water. Wow, it's really cold. I'll tell you what, I'll finish the job before it warms up. Whether ghosts or human, having a conversation is most important. I don't know what your story is for living in this house. But let's have a talk, man to man, man to woman, or whatever. No, help me, not the chicken again!
