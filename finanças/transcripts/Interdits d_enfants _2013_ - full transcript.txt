FORBIDDEN CHILDREN Elodie... My melody... I want to ask you something. Christmas is in 8 days. I want to be surrounded with other melodies. I mean... small melodies, which... will grow. You want children? Yes, with you. Oh, yes! Yes. Hello, Pa! Antoine, my son. Edmond! - Elodie! - It's nice to see you again. - So, happy? - You have no idea. Léa... - She's so beautiful! - ...And Isa. Oh, my little Isa! It's me, Grandpa Edmond. - What a beauty! - We've got plenty of time, Dad. - Let's go home. - Yes. Hello, Madeleine. Hello, my son. Isa, 3.1 kilos, and Léa, 3.2 kilos. That's great for twins. They have such pretty eyes. Let's go into the den. - Can you take her? - I've got her. - Careful, now. - OK. And Mary? It wasn't too hard for her? She was wonderful. She's part of our life now. Wait, Dad. Come here, we need to talk. Everything went well, before and after their birth. But when I went to the French Consulate in L.A., they refused to register the girls on my passport. Did they? But it had been arranged. No matter how much paperwork I handed over, she refused. - Are you a U.S. resident? - No. We regularly work in California. My wife's doctor is here. Other paperwork is needed, Sir, proof that your wife gave birth. To make sure that this isn't an illegal adoption. Do you have a certificate of delivery? No, the hospital said it didn't exist. A birth certificate would be enough. What you're saying is unbelievable. Then it was the passport. It was surreal. Two weeks before delivery, your wife took the plane? A real mother, a normal mother, would never have traveled. You were married two months before the birth? That isn't credible. Elodie... not a real mother, a normal one! Our marriage... a fake! When I insisted, she lost it. Do you realize that the consequences of your decision will hurt my children in France? I refuse to be threatened! You should have thought about it. Americans take your money without mentioning the risks. Then we have to clean it up. Go and see with them. I'll transfer your file to Nantes, where foreign births are handled. If you provide the details, your case will soon be resolved. In the end, some guy there recommended I contact the Federal Bureau. I got 2 American passports for the girls. Yes, but... They have French parents. These aren't French I.D. cards. Well, listen. You should go see a lawyer. Inès Boutet. I know her. She's very good. A French birth is easier than an American one. Of course. But it was necessary that we use a surrogate. That is illegal in France. Were you aware? Or did you intend to break the law? Well... May I know why you used a surrogate? A surrogate mother, Ms. Boutet. Excuse me. So? One day, Antoine wanted children. I did, too. But it would be difficult. I had a surgical procedure at 20 without really knowing the risks. I never found out. I told her that she should get checked out. That was in May of '98. You can never have children. Your ovules are fine, but you don't have a uterus. The results are conclusive. Here is the x-ray of a normal woman, with ovaries and a uterus. This is yours. You have MRKH Syndrome. A deformation that leads to atrophy of the reproductive system. The condition affects 1 in 4,500 women in France. In a few words, my gynecologist told me that my body was useless. My body was the living dead. At that moment, I grasped the sense of my abnormality and the operation I'd had when I was younger. I can never have children! How can we ever be happy? After all this? It's a curse! No, you'll see. There are plenty of solutions. There are plenty. Go ahead! Leave me for another woman! One who can give you the children you want! I want them with you. I want to share that with you. It was unthinkable to deprive my husband of having children. We didn't want to adopt. Surrogacy was the option. We spent many nights studying every possibility. The U.S., Canada, Great Britain, Belgium... Every aspect... - Personal, medical... - We asked ourselves, Could we accept that a stranger do this for us? Why not a friend, or a sister? What if she kept the baby? What if there were complications? What if the baby had health issues? What if? We chose California. We went to a specialized agency. Diana, the agency's director, told us that all candidates found surrogacy to be a gratifying, positive experience. They had a profound desire to help couples in need, like us. It was their gift. We wanted a woman who already had a family. One with whom we could feel close. They found us a mother of four. Mary Spangler, who resided in San Diego. What's more, she spoke some French. It was just a photo and some information on paper, but when I met her, I knew she was our fairy godmother. I couldn't keep my eyes off of her. Mary was like a dream. She talked like me and dressed like me. It seemed easy for her to have children and raise them. I found the woman who would help me. The woman who would give us the gift of carrying our children for nine months! That isn't nothing. It wasn't so easy. The medical treatment is complex, and success uncertain, with highs and lows. I'll never be able to do it. Never. We can do it! We're going to! My mother didn't want me to have children. Now I understand why. We will have that child. We will. Hold me close! It took more than a year. One March evening in 2000, after we had returned to France, the telephone rang. Mary was pregnant. In 9 months we would have... We would have not one, but two children! A victory over MRKH. And why California? The science is cutting-edge and the success rate high. Surrogacy is also legal and regulated over there... It protects the children in case there's an issue. Except for the issue at the Consulate. Well, let's try to clarify the situation. For now, your daughters were born in the States, where they are considered to be your children. They have American citizenship, but not French citizenship, as the vice-consul has doubts. She suspects an illegal adoption. She alerted Nantes, a bureau that is known to complicate formalities. Let me assure you, your case is not isolated or hopeless. There are solutions. I'll help you with the necessary paperwork to obtain French identification for your daughters and register their vital records. I advise you to say nothing to the authorities. - Yes, but... - No, nothing. Medical aid and in vitro fertilization are one thing, surrogacy is another. It is protected by your right to privacy. So, you should say nothing. You should wait 2 years. After 2 years, your parental rights will be indisputable. How pretty you are! I have to go. I've got to. Here you go, dear. When will you be back? Late. Look at Daddy! Hello? Yes, this is she. What is the reason? My husband's at work. I'm alone with our children, I... Bernard? Is Antoine there? Pass me to him. Antoine, we've been ordered to go to the police station. No, right away! The police will come if we don't! The police have an order. - Antoine! I don't know what to do! - Calm down, honey. The police will arrest us if we don't go right away! They'll take us away! They said they would! - I'm afraid for the girls. - Calm down. You don't realize! What if they take them? Go ahead. I'm on my way. - Right away! - I'll be there. This way, Sir. No, Madam, this way. - Hello. - Sit down. You know why you're here. Tell me everything. No, I have absolutely no idea why I'm here. The crime of which I'm accused, the rights I've been granted. It's a mystery. Mr. Desprez, you're here because you've committed a serious crime. And we talk here. You'll talk eventually. Aggressive behavior, suspectible sonogram, misappropriation of adoption laws. Do you agree to a medical examination? - What kind? - A gynecological examination. To confirm that you did indeed give birth. I will not, I have a right to privacy. I don't understand. Tell me about the birth. I went to the French Consulate in L.A. to declare my children. - The status was confirmed... - I'm not interested in your kids, but in their birth. The Consulate stated on October 28, 2000 that your wife was not their real mother. You behaved aggressively, a sign of your guilt. I wasn't the aggressive one at the Consulate. You're way off. Why did you give birth in San Diego? It was hard for me to get pregnant. We were medically assisted. In vitro fertilization. In a laboratory. A woman's eggs are fertilized with the husband's sperm. Her uterus is then inseminated with the fertilized embryo. Which doctors were consulted in France? There are no medical records of this on file. In the U.S., I wasn't able to... If you accept to undergo a medical examination, which I advise you to do, we'll leave you alone. We don't want to cause you any trouble. The answer is "no". Your statement. Sign here. That isn't what I said. Yes, those are our daughters. No, we did not adopt them. This is full of spelling errors. I'll sign once it's correct. If you'll sign your statements, here. Don't be a wise guy. I've cracked tougher ones than you. In any case, we'll be meeting again. We often work with the Americans at INTERPOL. We'll see who's the strongest. We have to hang in there. We can't be eaten up by anguish. We need to be able to laugh. We'll still need to see friends and family. You know what? Let's hire a part-time nanny. Let's throw a nice party for their baptism. Yes, you're right. Daphné! Daphné! Can I give her to you? I'm so happy you're here! You and I don't share the same opinion. I did as the lawyer advised. They're registered... - Would you like some? - No, thanks. Sure. Their vital records have also been declared. Just need the family records book, an absolute necessity for their French filiation and inheritance. What joy! Don't they look like their father, Sophia? Oh! More like Elodie, don't they? I didn't want to say it, Martine, but Elodie was exactly like that at birth. It's a mix between Antoine and Elodie. Isa is like her dad, Léa like her mom. They look like themselves. That's what counts. See, Mom, I did it. You've always succeeded. Your studies, your work... - I've always told you. - You didn't tell me everything. - What do you mean? - You know very well. - Where's your nanny from? - Daphné? Trois Rivières, in Quebec. Who ever thought you'd marry Bernard's sister? Let me remind you that I introduced them. I was sure they would get along. How cute! I wish I could have had more than one. We see that, Madeleine. I had 6. One after the other. I didn't have time to enjoy it, or even time to enjoy life. Marguerite! - I'm so happy you came! - I wouldn't miss it. Congratulations! They're amazing! How old are they? - Almost a year, now. - Do you miss work? No. It's a joy to have twins, but also a full-time job. Listen, that's all the better. The police were asking questions about you. Whether or not you wanted to get pregnant, if we knew your husband, and so on. It's Marguerite Allart, from work. - Yes, hi. - Hello. The police were asking about us. That's insane. - They stopped by the office, too. - Really? I didn't tell you so that you wouldn't worry. "Were they aware my wife was pregnant with twins?" "What was our relationship?" That's code for, "Is he gay?" They're investigating as if we're criminals. Hello, sign here, Mrs. Desprez. Thank you. That's all. - Goodbye, have a nice day. - Have a nice day. We've been summoned for September 17. Call the lawyer and schedule a meeting. First the police, now the courts. They think you went to the States with a bag of cash to buy 2 kids. Those idiots. There was indeed an investigation carried out to question your neighbors and colleagues. As well as to assess your medical records. The investigation concluded your pregnancy as impossible. That is why the summons stated: "To be further examined." You can no longer hide the truth. You said that after two years, we would be the official parents. The charges make it no longer an option. Here, sweetheart, one spoonful for Grandma. That's tasty, isn't it? Jérôme Dufour called me. He's a former classmate. He's looking to hire a manager for the Paris offices. Not the job of my dreams, but I'd be back before 7 p.m. weekdays. - Daphné can work full-time. - Well, the way it's been going... It would allow us to grow our family. Well, time for beddy-bye. Let's not forget our fairy godmother. Look. Give her a kiss. Your turn, give her a little kiss. You, too. Give Mary a little kiss. - A kiss for grandma and grandpa. - One kiss for grandma. Be right back. He could have found another wife. - It would have been less trouble. - Madeleine... You can't choose who you love. We should stand by them, whatever the cost. I don't know if I can open up to a complete stranger. But you must. My whole life, I've had to defend myself. No money, no books, an abnormal body. Now I must defend myself for being infertile - and for having kids. - Elodie... - May I call you Elodie? - Sure. What happened to you is hard to bear. But you're a brave woman. Your girls are well. Breathe, be calm, and be confident. That's what will impress the judge. Mr. Antoine Desprez? Ms. Boutet? Mr. Antoine Desprez, your wife Elodie, born Frascetti, is said to have given birth to twins by cesarean on October 25, 2000 in San Diego. From a medical standpoint, she cannot have children. So she didn't give birth. Why did you lie to the police? My wife never faked a pregnancy. She never hid a pillow under her dress, or declared a fake pregnancy to the authorities. Your Honor, it's very hard for infertile parents. They fear for their children's future and are forced to discuss private matters. Police questioning doesn't allow for such an explanation. Today, Mr. and Mrs. Desprez wish to clarify the situation. Good. I'm listening, Sir. My wife and I very much wanted a child. We then discovered she was infertile. It was a shock for both of us. We looked for a solution. We decided to use a surrogate. Did you know that surrogacy is banned by French law? Yes, but it's legal in California. The law allows for them to have legal records. Officially, my wife and I are their parents. It was confirmed by a sovereign authority and in accordance with incontestable international law. I don't share your point of view. This is France, not California. If you wish to benefit from Californian laws, apply for citizenship and move there. Thank you. It's easier talking to the judge than to the police. I'm not afraid. Why did you use a surrogate, Mrs. Desprez? A surrogate mother, Your Honor. If you prefer. Madam? I didn't want to adopt. It takes too long and often ends with no adoption at all. Friends had already experienced problems with adoption. The children suffered. You've committed a serious crime. Do you know what MRKH Syndrome is? Named after those who studied it, Mayer, Rokitansky, Kuster, Hauser. Do you know what it's like to not have a uterus? I can imagine, but that isn't the issue. Imagining isn't enough. You must live with it. At 18, I still hadn't menstruated. I was humiliated. Intercourse was often painful. My body disgusted me, but I said nothing. I kept it a secret. I'd go dancing, make my colleagues laugh, I'd work a lot. It isn't a reason to break the law. Nature didn't bless me, but can't I be a mother? Can't I want to have children with my husband? What's the point of the body in that case? To make love? Just to make love? If you can't see a future with the man you love, what's the point? If you can't see a future at all, what's the point? You have no idea how hard it is for a woman to use a surrogate. - Why did you lie to the police? - To protect my children. A wolf's instinct. Wolves have their own babies. Thank you, Madam. Don't worry, that wasn't bad. She didn't ask questions about the girls. They aren't of interest to the courts. French law, European law, and international law always put the best interest of the child first. The fight will be long, but you will win it. You should be relieved. - You mean... - You could have been arrested. But you're free to go. The weather's nice. Enjoy it. Hello, my darlings. - Did everything go well? - Yes. Your little girls have big news for you. They took their first steps today. - No! - That's amazing! Will you show us? Go to Mommy. It's your turn, sweetheart. Clean up all this mess, girls. Yes, the cards. You're big girls. In kindergarten, you're going to learn how to write and draw. You'll make lots of friends. Daphné will pick you up at 4:30 p.m. with your snack. Here... put those in there. You'll come home and have your bath while waiting for Mom and Dad, OK? Wednesdays, you'll go to your grandparents'. And Fridays, either Mom or Dad will pick you up. Give me a kiss. Cover up if you get cold. What is it? - They didn't even cry. - That's great. Maybe they don't see me as their real mother. No, just the opposite. They didn't cry because they aren't afraid to leave you. They know they'll see you again because you're their real mother. I'm silly. You're right. Once upon a time, a kangaroo fairy godmother met the lovely Julie, who was a princess. The princess lived in the great forest. As Princess Julie was crying, the kangaroo fairy godmother said, "Why are you crying?" Princess Julie dried her tears. She said, "I'd really like to have a child, but I can't "because I don't have a baby bag in my tummy." The kangaroo fairy godmother replied, "I have one in my tummy. "If you want, "You could use it. I'll carry your baby. "After it's born, I'll give you the baby." What was said, was done. That's how Princess Julie had a baby. Like Mommy. Who was the fairy who carried you in her tummy? - Mary. - Yes. - Do you think they dream about it? - They're starting to understand. Hold on, darling. Hold on tight. Are you ready? Go ahead. Go! You little rascal. - Ready for a snack? - Yes. Butterfly. - Butterfly. - A butterfly. - What's a butterfly? - It eats flowers. It takes the little seed from one flower to the next to make baby flowers. It's their fairy godmother. - Like fairy godmother Mary? - Exactly. Like our fairy godmother Mary. - Isa! Lea! Let's go! - Hurry! Come on, let's go! Yes, hello, Ms. Boutet. That's impossible. The penal case on top of the civil? What does that mean? The prosecution accuses us of lying on the birth certificates, of fraudulently adopting our own kids, of public disorder. Those are copy-cat accusations of previous rulings on cases involving surrogacy in France. It has nothing to do with you. How can we be accused of lying about their vital records when those records are Californian? I declared them in accordance with state laws. For crying out loud! It's complicated. The judicial system, too. So, listen closely. For the civil lawsuit, you must establish your daughters' filiation. The vice-consul in Los Angeles suspects you of adopting two little American girls. That's a crime. The judge in Créteil sent the case for fraud to the penal courts. Do you understand? You are in violation of French law. Don't forget that. - You risk conviction. - What's the risk? For the civil, your girls' birth certificates will be void. For the penal, a fine and up to 2 years of prison. Prison? But... That's absurd. So, life doesn't matter? Love isn't worth anything? No one cares if those two kids are happy? Hold on. Don't worry more than you should. After all, I'm here to help you. We'll be prepared and we'll fight. These two lawsuits are full of inconsistencies. I'm confident about the outcome. Ms. Boutet, will our girls be taken away from us? Absolutely not. Yes? Anyway, we have time to plan ahead. The courts aren't in a hurry. You're sure about the kids? Completely. They can't be taken away. Be confident. You were very categorical about the children. I couldn't say they might lose them. It's possible, but nothing is certain. They have enough to worry about. Mrs. Desprez! I would love to have children like yours. Today Isa built a huge skyscraper. It was very sturdy. It's funny because she attributes a family to everything. For example, if she sees a tree, she'll say, "daddy leaf", "mommy leaf", "baby leaf". Léa likes to express herself through drawing. Come see. She drew a woman with two butterflies in her belly. She wrote her name under one, and her sister's under the other. Under the woman, she wrote "Mommy". How symbolic! You want the berry? Go ahead, draw the berry, sweetheart. - Those are fish. - What? - Daddy, do you think I've grown? - Let me see. Stand still. Yes. Since the new year, you've grown a centimeter. That's the postman, always on the hour, never sour! Hello, Mr. Desprez. Sign here, please. - Thank you. - Thanks. - Have a nice day. Goodbye. - You, too. Goodbye. It always ends up happening. We have a hearing with a new judge for the penal case. Happy new year. The hearing is on April 30. Are you alright? Don't scare me like that. I need you. The girls do, too. What will happen to them if we go to prison? Bernard and Martine will look after them. What's wrong, Mommy? - Nothing. Mommy has a tummy-ache. - We'll call the doctor. The tummy doctor? - The what? - The tummy doctor. The doctor for tummies. Will I have to tell my entire life story again? I'm afraid so. It's too much for me. It kills me. Every time. I can talk for you, if you want. Think of your girls. It will be fine. Mr. and Mrs. Desprez, Ms. Boutet, Please. You'll see that it's nice to have a big room. Is it alright if I put your books here? I'll try to put them in place. So... where do we put this one? That isn't mine. That's my sister's. OK, well, wait here. I'll be right back. - Can I come in? - Yes. Look what I brought! - There it is! - Yep! That's it. They're enrolled. Let's go! Girls! Your first day of school is September 1. Now you're big girls. Since we're big girls, knock before coming in our rooms! The principal asked for their birth certificate. Without a family records book, an I.D. isn't enough. - Do you know where they are? - In the office. Where did you put them? I can't find them. Did you check here? Where did you put them? How could you have lost the girls' birth certificates? I'll find them. Don't worry. You never put anything away. You never do. It piles up and piles up. - Don't get angry. - Angry? Don't get angry! Don't you realize it's important? How could you do that to them? I'm so scared they'll be taken away, so I hid them. I hid them so well that I can't find them. Yes? Oh, good evening. Yes. Alright. Alright. We'll be there. Muriel. My uterus was removed due to complications after delivery. Chloé. MRKH Syndrome, no uterus. Edith. I'm a DES daughter. There was a malformation. I'm infertile. Diethylstilbestrol was prescribed in the '70s to prevent miscarriage. It resulted in genital abnormalities and infertility in many children. There you have it. Carine. I've done my 6th in vitro fertilization and still nothing. Yes? My first delivery didn't go well. I lost my baby and my uterus had to be removed. My husband and I would still like to have a child through a surrogate mother. We'd like to know how you chose your surrogate. How did it go for you? Do you mind? To choose Mary, our fairy godmother, as we call her, we followed our instincts and our hearts. We had a number of exchanges with her by phone, by email. It confirmed that it was the right choice. And then we met her. She understood how hard it was for a couple to not have children. Her mother had had the same experience. She was proud to help us. And her husband, who is head of P.R. for an airline carrier, explained that Mary felt fulfilled as a mother. She loved being pregnant and had easy pregnancies. He respected her choices. She was determined. A few months later, in March of 2000, - Mary was pregnant. - We were pregnant. I gained 17 kilos. That had never happened before. I even began to produce milk. The heart! We weren't expecting one child, but two. Two girls. I couldn't stop touching Mary's stomach. I felt her babies kick. I mean, my babies. Are they already talking? They said, "We're on our way, Mom, just wait a bit". On October 25, 2000, - there they were... - It is also important to say that Mary put our children into the world, but... she also put me into the world as a mother. Without her, without that double birth, I don't know where I'd be today, nor our relationship. If you don't mind, how much did it cost? Almost 50,000 euros. Three-fourths of it went to medical expenses and to lawyers who did the paperwork. We'll be in debt for 10 years. - We're lucky we can do it. - I never could. We hardly earn 2,000 euros per month. If we can't choose to give life, what's the point of living? Let's get some air. You see why it's important to fight for our cause. Well, there's wine and orange juice. You can talk amongst yourselves. Mr. and Mrs. Desprez? Would you agree to an interview with a reporter? Your case is emblematic. Your account would be insightful. - Yes, alright. - Come here. Pleased to meet you. Hello. Can we go outside? Yes, of course. I've been hearing about India and the Ukraine as possibilities. Yes, it's cheaper than in the U.S. or Canada. But it's very dangerous. You'd be taking a big risk. Your children would be without any citizenship. They would be stateless. Excuse me, Madam. Nitya Delvoye. I'd like to speak with you. - Yes, of course. - Excuse me. I have to help the girls with homework. - Shall we sit? - Yes. Like you, I'm a victim of MRKH Syndrome. The idea of never having children would be... I would feel like a sick person, or someone who's useless. I'm not a real woman. I'll stay a little girl forever. I've experienced the same thing. My case proves that anything is possible. In fact, when I met my husband, I stopped lying to myself. After much, much reflection, we decided to use a surrogate. I don't know if I'd ever have the energy and means. I barely just finished school to be a social worker. It really isn't something you do on your own, but together. That is very, very important. - Is there someone in your life? - Yes, I have a boyfriend. - We talk about getting married. - If you do, don't hide anything. You must tell the truth. Because it takes a lot of love to begin such a saga. If you want, you could stop by the house. Whenever you want. We could talk. I'd love to. Thank you. SURROGACY: A CHILD BY ANY MEANS ...Mom, Isa, and me. - In grandma's garden. - There's Mary! No, don't even mention it. It was so hard. It's too bad that Daphné went back to Canada. She could have seen us. That was Mylène. She and her husband can help. They'll sign petitions, whatever. That's nice. Yes? Hello, Mr. Desprez? This is Marguerite Allart, Elodie's old colleague. I had no idea of what you've been going through. Infertility is a terrible thing. But to be bothered about it is unacceptable. Unacceptable! You were right to talk to the Media. - Keep it up. I'm on your side. - Thanks, Marguerite. Mom, if people agree with you, can we become French? Of course, my dear. Let's go, it's bedtime. - No! - Yes. Let's go. It's past your bedtime. We'll tell you what everyone said tomorrow. That isn't going to stop tonight. Hello, Ms. Boutet. That's fantastic. Thank you. Thank you. See you soon. The judge dismissed the penal suit. We won't go to prison. - They won't take the girls. - We're free. The prettiest melody of all, my melody! I'll teach you when you're older. Here, dear. - Who's it for? - Elina. And one for Dad! - Lea, Mom's calling you. - Take one to Dad. Oh, my little dear! Thank you, sweetheart. Thank you. - Thanks, goodbye. - Goodbye. - What was that? - Nothing, wrong address. I'm going to wash my motorcycle. That took you a while. What is it? The prosecution isn't dropping the fraudulent adoption case. They want to void the girls' civil status. Any benefit from the dismissal was for nothing. It's grotesque. The public prosecutor won't let it go. They want to get us on the civil where the penal failed. They don't even know. It will take years to heal our family's wounds. Don't exaggerate. I'm going out. Don't take off like that at night. - No, Antoine. - Let me go! What are you doing here? All of this is my fault. Another woman wouldn't have been so much trouble for you. Don't say such things. We have two amazing girls, honey. We'll see it all the way through. We'll fight for their civil status and for their rights. Come, now. We'd be better off in bed. Three plus three. - Six. - Five plus three. - Eight. - Seven plus seven. Fourteen. Mom, our friend Malik is... French and Moroccan. We're only American. That isn't fair. You're French at heart. That's what matters. That's great, dear. You'll be the head of the class. You're all grown up. - Hello. - Hello. I came to see your wife. We met at the meeting. Nitya! She's the one I told you about. - Yes. - Come in. I wanted to speak with you. - Is it a bad time? - No. - Will you stay for dinner? - I'd love to. We'll talk after, alright? - Our two treasures. - Here they are. Hello. - Will you come play with us? - Alright, I'll follow you. Let's go. Let's race! It seems like they're old friends. - I'm full. - Me too. Let's go. It's bedtime. - Goodnight. - Goodnight. Let's brush your teeth. Nitya, you can sit in the living room in the meantime. What's wrong? I told my boyfriend the truth. I haven't heard from him. I've failed at everything. I'm sick of it. I don't know why I'm alive. You haven't yet met the man who will truly love you. He's out there somewhere. Will you stay the night? You'll feel better tomorrow. Goodbye, my little darlings. - Goodbye. - Bye, Nitya. - Have a nice day. - Thanks. The small fish in the sea Swim, swim, swim The small fish in the sea Swim just like the big fish The small fish and the big fish Swim as they all should The big fish and the small fish Swim well, too The small fish in the sea Swim, swim, swim The small fish in the sea Swim just like the big fish Bravo, Nitya. Will you be our nanny? Would you like that? - It would lift my spirits. - Yes! In the public prosecution case against Mr. and Mrs. Desprez, as the public prosecutor's request, which does not contest the opposability of the U.S. ruling, is inadmissible in the interest of international public order. The court dismisses the prosecution's request to void the civil status of Isa and Léa Desprez. Inasmuch, to do so would not be in the children's best interest, as they would be without any indicator of their filiation. Any public disturbance has been caused by the prosecution, not by Mr. and Mrs. Desprez. The court hereby dismisses the prosecution's case. The Public Treasury is to pay for these proceedings. You are free. The courts have finally sided with the children. It's a first. Let's wait for the prosecution's reaction. - Mrs. Desprez! - Over here! - Your first reaction? - Please! Now we're going to cross. We look left and right. Is anyone there? Let's go. Good. Do you have much homework? A little, a lot, passionately, madly so, not at all! Let's go inside. Here you go. What time is it? 5:05 p.m., almost time to watch television. - Yes! - Yes! Let's move on to our next topic, with Mr. and Mrs. Desprez. Thank you for joining us here. You chose to use surrogacy. You now call for its legalization in France, although many oppose it. The opposition calls it commodification of the female body. Who wants to begin? Mr. Desprez? Yes. It should be legislated with a concern for humanity, based on the notion of a gift... To prevent procreative business. Women should have a right to choose for themselves. Ms. Slansky? A woman is not an incubator. The female body is inalienable. Pregnancy isn't fit to be a social profession. Society's demands aren't always right. Every year in France, more than 100 couples use surrogates. France believes to dissuade them by ignoring their children. Not having kids, or having to fight for their rights is an easy choice to make. They've thought it over. What about the intrauterine link, necessary for child development? Ms. Slansky, let's hear from Professor Alexandre. Thank you. The link certainly exists. But research shows that a woman doesn't become a mother the day she gives birth. If so, there would be no neglect or babies ending up in the freezer. However, it seems... What do you think of our parents? They're terrific. You're lucky. Don't walk so fast. That didn't go badly, did it? - Why don't you answer me? - Why do you always cut me off? You always interrupt me. Everywhere, all the time. It's fine at home, but in front of others... We were in the middle of a debate. I also have a point of view. You aren't alone in this. It's important to us and the girls. - Yes, it is. - It's important for the fight. I know. I'm sorry. I won't do it again. - What language is that? - Esperanto. The language of hope. Hope that people will understand and respect one another. Just a silly dream. Excuse me, were you just on television? Yes. You're a criminal. Renting another woman's body to have a child is a crime. Happy Birthday with our most sincere wishes May these flowers bring you happiness May the entire year be sweet and light for you May next year we all be brought together To sing from our hearts Happy Birthday Let's open gifts! Wait, there's something we wrote. - Mom. - Dad. Mom. When you have a mother, you say, "I love you". Dad. When you have a father, you say, "I love you". There's a lot of meaning in it, because "I love you" is always the solution. I love you, Mom. How great! I love you, Dad. How great! How cute! Bravo! Mom! - How are you, girls? - Good. Wait here, I'll be right back. Hello. You wanted to see me, Ms. Dumas? Yes. Hello, Mrs. Desprez. There isn't any problem. Your girls have great grades. They're smart, focused... They're very bright. There's just something a bit odd that happened during a lesson on the human body, specifically in regards to where babies come from. When I asked the children what they knew, most replied that the baby is in the mother's belly, and so forth. But Isa... - Teacher! Teacher! - Yes? My Mom didn't carry me in her belly. She doesn't have a baby sack. Another woman carried me, just like a kangaroo carries its baby in its pouch. She was telling the truth, in her own way. I was born without a uterus. So, I had to use a surrogate. I see. Now I understand better. I've heard of that. The ban is completely incomprehensible. Well... I wish you good luck. I truly hope that you will win the fight. Goodbye. - Thank you. - Goodbye. Do you realize? It's a good sign. People are starting to think differently than the authorities. We could celebrate. Just the two of us. What? What is it? Are you at home? Can't you tell me? Antoine, tell me. I'm on my way. Girls! Let's go. What's going on? - It's our fairy godmother! - Yes, it's me! Who is Léa and who is Isa? Look how you've grown! You knew about this and you didn't tell me. Come, Nitya. -Nitya has the same problem. - I see. I told her that you're soul-searching. She says that it's so wonderful to have children. It's so hard when you can't. We were adopted. They both suffered a lot before being loved. Yes. After she had her 4 kids, she decided to help a couple. A couple whose child would know where he was from. When she was 17, a friend of her mother's did that. It's so wonderful. She promised herself that she would do the same one day. Yes. - Don't be sad. - I'm not sad. It's just so touching. If I understand, you invented a new way to make babies. Did you and Dad boink? What does that mean? Your Dad and Mom are the ones who boink. - And the lawsuit? - It never ends. - It never ends. - Incredible. But we keep fighting. Please, Sir. Mr. and Mrs. Desprez, I'm touched by your argument. But you must understand that surrogacy challenges a basic law in France. The mother gives birth. Not carrying the child doesn't mean one isn't fit to parent. I didn't carry my own children, but they are still 100% my own. My own country won't give me the right to be their mother. They aren't even in my family records book. That's the scandal, leaving them without official parents. Why would you want a child if you can't have one? It seems like sterile women are pushing the limits of reason. Just look at India. Surrogate mothers are locked up in factory-like dormitories. The lack of legislation allows for that to happen. The status of the woman carrying the child must be protected. Far from progress, any legalization of surrogacy would be a step back. A woman's body is not an object. It's about a woman's dignity. It's about my dignity as a woman to be a mother, Madam. The desire to have children does not justify the right. Please! In any case, a uterine transplant is one solution to infertility problems. Every year in France 7,000 women under 40 must have their uterus removed. How many transplants do you think could be done? Not all wish to have children or a transplant. Where would they come from? Cadavers? Or from living women, willing to donate their uterus? The waiting list would take years, like for kidneys, There's also the illegal market that comes with it. Before dreaming of an ideal world, Sir, in France today, children are born through surrogacy to French parents. Many more will follow. The administrative situation of these children is grotesque. With no filiation, they exist, but also don't. They're ghost children. Can't we end such discrimination, in the interest of the child? That would challenge the country's prohibition of surrogacy and the order of future generations. - Do you want some more, Léa? - No, thank you. Eat it, darling. It's fruit. We haven't seen the postman in a while! I was sure of it. The prosecution has appealed. They're requesting that the girls' vital records be considered void. What does "appeal" mean, Dad? Is it about liking something? - Are they happy we're here? - Go get your backpacks. Every time we win, the prosecution appeals and it starts over. It's been going on for 7 years. 7 years we've been on guard, worried... tired. Our family has been eaten up by fear. They want to make our children disappear. They want to leave them without any status, identity, or French citizenship. Do you realize? It boggles the mind. The prosecution wants to destroy what is vital to us, our link to the girls. Hold on, how can you be guilty of having children? It will work itself out, slowly, but surely. - Come on, now. - No, I'm not in the mood. - I don't even feel desire anymore. - Stop it. That will change when the legal troubles are over. Love is about imagination. I don't know. Think of Elodie in a new way, then go get her. There you go. If only I weren't preoccupied with debt. - Do you want to play with us? - Sure, I'll be right there. - You're playing the passport game. - Yes. - Can I take this one? - Yes. Stand there. Passport? - French. You may go. - Thank you. Passport? You're American, not French. You may not enter. But I'm French. My parents are French. - Show me your family records book. - I can't get one. I have two cultures, so what? I'm sick of people being mean when I enter my country. It's my turn, now! Put the gate back up. COURT OF APPEALS Calm yourselves. Be confident, as I am. I asked the child psychologist to testify. The twins Isa and Léa Desprez are very happy. Mr. and Mrs. Desprez are loving parents. It's a perfectly balanced family. However, if the courts continue with the lawsuit, the twins will suffer from a symbolic deficiency, which the courts will have caused by challenging their filiation. Furthermore, invalidating that filiation will be catastrophic to their psychological development. They will be thrown into a world of unknowns, due to the absence of any official filiation. You must certainly know that when a human being cannot be named, he does not know where he comes from. When one doesn't know that, one doesn't know where to go. The living dead. Thank you, Doctor. Mr. and Mrs. Desprez, you are nevertheless aware that you have broken the law. No. We have never thought that. It's the opposite. Californian laws on filiation are internationally recognized. France recognizes that. But French law forbids surrogacy. You have broken the law. If you say so. Ms. Boutet? I would like to bring up Dr. Estelle Montfort's final point to make it clearer, Sir. The judicial system, whose laws represent France, the country of the Rights of Man, is condemning children to the death of their identity. So, how far along have you come? The cases keep coming. They all look alike. Money... We took the girls to see the "Head Doctor", as Léa says. - What's that? - A child psychologist. To know if they're doing well. Tell her to come here. She'll see it with her own eyes. - And Nitya? - She's at her parents'. That's too bad. She gets on well with the girls. - You lost my American barrette. - No. I put it right there. Is that how you take care of the things you borrow? Don't get mad. - Here it is. - Give it to me! - Let me go! - What is going on? - Stop that fighting right now. - We're not, it's a discussion. Every good discussion gets a little heated. Lolo! Your phone! I'll get it. Hello? Yes, this is she. I see. I... I'm on my way. Goodbye, Madam. Don't tell the girls. Ms. Delvoye? Yes. I'm Elodie Desprez. Thank you for coming. When did it happen? Two days ago. That morning, she learned her ex-boyfriend had gotten married and was going to be a father. I was supposed to send this to you. Let's take her back home. Dear Elodie, meeting you and your family was the best thing to ever happen to me. But that happiness did not put an end to my despair. I am, and will always be, a girl upset with her body. One from whom boys run when they learn the truth. I'll never be strong enough to handle everything that you have to handle. Don't be sad. I leave with a calm mind. I'll never forget you. Neither you, your husband, nor Isa and Léa. I love you with all my heart. - Can you pass me the yellow? - Yes. What are you drawing? A little girl saying "hello" to her mom. Here. It's a bit random. - Mom! - My dear. - Mom! - My darling. - How are you? - Good. Did it go well? So? Tell me. Or are you a celebrity now? You never tell your mother anything now that you're in the headlines. I didn't see any reporters. I went to Nitya's funeral. - Was there an accident? - She committed suicide. She could no longer live with MRKH. I was so ashamed. I put 5 perfect children into the world, but the 6th... I was so ashamed. So very much. I resented myself for the deformity. I was ashamed and afraid for you. That's why I always... pushed you to study, so that you would have a good, time-consuming job. You wouldn't have time to think of having children. My whole life, I've been ashamed of it, Lolo. And even now, although you have such lovely children, I'm still ashamed. I will until the day I die. I wish infertile women didn't commit suicide and that their mothers weren't ashamed. That they didn't feel guilty. Facts provided for and punished by law in articles 227.12 to 13, 227.29, 227.30 of Penal Code. The Court of Appeals recognizes the inadmissibility of the prosecution's request and dismisses it. Mr. and Mrs. Desprez are free to go. The hearing is adjourned. The prosecution has appealed. 9 years. And we still don't have the right to be our children's parents. We'll appeal as well. We'll take it to the European Court, if we must. Why do the courts still bother you? We want to see the judge, to find out! You can write to ask for a meeting, if you want. Madam... - Madam... - The judge. - Sure. - No, Your Honor. So, Your Honor... - I, Léa... - Léa... and my sister, Isa... - Would like to meet with you. - To meet? OK. No, girls, don't leave your bikes there! Help me take them in! Mom! Mom! Bravo, my darlings! They killed me! They're barely 10. How will it be when they're 20? There's a letter for you both on the table. The judge has agreed to meet with you. Better late than never. We've been waiting for over a year. Shall we go? Please, come in. Have a seat. Have a seat, young ladies. You asked to meet with me. Yes, Your Honor. You weren't in a hurry to see us. How do you spend your day? I run, sleep, walk, and eat. - And you? - The same. - Do you have friends? - Yes. And how is school? I work hard, I get good grades. Léa does, too. We're in the top of the class and class representatives. - And besides school? - We do theater, ride horses... Dance, paint... Our lives are good. That's not why we came. What do you have to say? Why have you been bothering our parents for 10 years? Yes, why? We want our papers. We're French. Leave them alone. They love us and we love them. Your parents didn't respect the law. - So they've been prosecuted. - And we have, too. Not exactly. In history class, the teacher told us that when one of... - The Majesty's subjects... - Committed a bad act, - the king condemned him. - And banished him. His family was banished from the country. Well, it's the same for us. I only apply the laws. SUBTITLES: RED BEE MEDIA FRANCE
