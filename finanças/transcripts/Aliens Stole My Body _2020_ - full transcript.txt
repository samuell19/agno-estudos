All hail the Leader Zupreme! And? And, uh... And, uh... Ultimate Ruler of the Galaxy! Ultimate Ruler of the Galaxy, and... And, uh... And, uh... Ultimate Ruler of the Galaxy he's about to destroy! I couldn't have said it better myself. Showtime. Okay, good to go. All righty. Test. Test. Test. Stop moving the camera, Lackey. Calling all losers. Galactic Patrol, that means you. Did you really think your puny Alcatron prison could hold me, the galaxy's greatest evil genius? Now I'm back on my Doomstar, and I have perfected my terrifying Time Trap. Let me give you an example of what I mean. See this here? I think you'll probably recognize it. You see, just like I was in a prison, imagine the whole galaxy stuck in a moment of time forever. There will be no escape for you. So, please, try and stop me, losers. Come on. What is wrong with the gravity in the ship, Lackey? Cut it! Is it possible that B'kr has perfected a Time Trap device? I must answer by saying I am not the one to ask. Then who? The legendary being who first thought of trapping time itself. Of course. Ah-rit Alber Ite, the original Time Strider. Our new mission is clear. To save the galaxy, we must find him at once. Not to beat around the bush, but it's been years since we've had contact with Ah-rit. Plink! He could be anywhere, so what course should I set? We must first look where we know he is not. Planet Earth, where the young Deputy Allbright saw his father last, and who may hold the key as to where he is now. And with the threat of time running out forever, we must proceed at maximum speed to Earth no matter the cost. Leaf it to me. Founded by the original Time Strider, the Galactic Patrol has been responsible for keeping all 5,600 dimensions at peace for over 30,000 Earth years. Gee P'Gee, so, who exactly is this Time Strider guy? The Time Strider is also known as Ah-rit Alber Ite. Ah-rit Alber Ite? My dad Art Allbright. It's his original name, I guess. His alien name? Daddy is not an alien. Eric, Earthlings can't join the Galactic Patrol, but Uncle Art is an officer, so, obviously, he has to be one of them. Gee P'Gee, is Daddy an alien? All Galactic Patrollers are aliens to each other, a fact which unites them, because each being different means all beings are the same. It didn't say no. It didn't say yes. Doesn't matter. What's important is finding out where our father is. Rod, the aliens told us. He's on a classified mission. That was two years ago. If he was okay, he would've let us know by now. Something's gone wrong, so wherever he is, he needs help. He needs me. Then ask the question. Gee P'Gee, where's Art Allbright? I've tried that one a million times. Right here. See, you need to come up with a really specific question. Is that something alien? Nah. It's just Mickey. Rod, come on. My Expellerator's not exploding anymore. You gotta try it. Five minutes, Mickey! All right. See you out there. He's so weird. Are we even gonna tell him about the aliens? He couldn't handle it. Specifically, he'd... He'd what? I know what to ask. Gee P'Gee, what specifically can I do to find my father? Open the front door. - Hide this, quick. - Go. Oh! Mickey? What the Ferkel? Rod, why is the front door open? Elspeth? Hey, you two. Did Rod and Elspeth already go to Seldom Seen? - They... - Didn't say. But they could have. Hmm. Okay. Mickey. Deep breath, Mickey. You're okay. Where are we? Onboard the Starship Ferkel. They're alien... Aliens, that's right. - The ones we told you about. - Sort of. Two years ago. Remember? That wasn't a joke? The Galactic Police? Captain Cracker? Uh, it's Grakker. Say it with me. Ping Pong? Tar Paper with the... With the... Oh! No. This is... This is Eye Six. No. The plant... The plant... No. You got one right, smarty plants. Plink! Told you he couldn't handle it. This... What's this? It's okay. You can say it. This is so cool! Okay. He's handling it, in a weird way. A thing of beauty is a joy forever, wouldn't you agree? Uh... Should I? What part of "I'm gonna trap the entire Allbright family "in a moment of sheer terror forever" do you not understand? Uh, I don't know, uh, all of it? Lackey... I need to get my revenge... No. No. ...on Rod Allbright. But, so... What's wrong, sir? I'll tell you what's wrong. I still don't know exactly where to place my Time Trap. And the one person that does know is Rod's dad, and he is still missing. Oh, thank you. Thank you, sir. So delicious. I forgot, you like that. Get out of my face. Go lick down the anti-matter vats or something. Right away, sir. At once, sir. My tongue is already tingling. Ah, look at this. Lookie-loo. Eric, give it. I have a way better question. Gee P'Gee? Gee P'Gee, are you there? It's Linda, Rod's sister. Gee P'Gee, why are bananas yellow? Gee P'Gee, is the Ferkel in our house right now? Ask about it again. Gee P'Gee, where is the Ferkel right now? The Ferkel has left Dimension Q and now travels in multi-dimensional space. Linda? Eric? What have you got under there? What? You were supposed to hide it. Nothing. Mmm-hmm? Well, you know, you shouldn't take Rod's things without asking his permission. What thing? Hmm. What is this? A toy? - No... - It's a Gee P'Gee. A Gee P'Gee? Where did Rod get this? This Galactic Patrol Guidebook, Mark Five, - was teleported to Deputy Rod Allbright... - Oh, no. What do we do? ...eight Earth months ago on the occasion of his 13th birthday as a gift from the grateful crew of the Starship Ferkel. Ferkel? What... What are those things? Why are Rod and Elspeth with them? What is this? You have to say "Gee P'Gee" first, Mom, then ask a question. It kind of knows everything. Roddie thinks it could even tell us where Daddy is. Only if we know how to ask the right question. Mmm-hmm. I really miss Daddy. Me too. Very good. Huh. Oh. What's its purpose? It doesn't need one. It's delicious. Oh. Hey, look. Now look at this, huh? Yeah. That's impressive. Yeah. Wow! - Oh, my. What just happened? - Uh... - I am in need of assistance. - Dear Tar. Does your device come with what you would call an instruction manual? ...confabulation on your eyes. - Thank you, Madame Pong. - Oh, my dear Tar. It's for my patent application. Oh. Yeah. Very thorough. It's also delicious. Aliens. Uh, sorry. Subject is secure. Wait. "Subject"? Perhaps not the best choice of words. "Experimental test subject" would be more accurate. This has never been tried on an Earthling before. Uh, it's been tried. It just hasn't worked. Are any of you ever going to tell me what's really going on around here? Uh, nope. Classified. Not the best idea. Highly doubtful. Too dangerous. Have you ever thought that if you did tell me, maybe I could help? And so could we. Yeah. We can? Young Rod, all you need to know is that we are helping you contact your father. By strengthening the psychic link that connects the two of you. Psychic link? Yes. It is a way to exchange information between minds simply with a touch. Elspeth, that's how the Tar taught you and I to use our flying belts. Hey. Ow! Flying belts? Awesome! Wait. My dad did that, too, the night he left us. Ow! Did your dad actually transfer knowledge from his mind to yours? I think so, but I don't know what. In a moment, we all will know. Is this gonna hurt? Uh, not me. Are you ready, young deputy? Not really. Hmm. Excellent. How is that excellent? From my talon to your nose. Wait. Why my... Tatmen... Tatmen. Mentat. Young deputy? Uh-oh. I think we broke him. Clear! - No. - Does that work on humans? Oh, you're right. Young deputy? Young deputy? Perhaps you shouldn't have energized his underdeveloped human brain through his scent-sniffing face holes. Ah, yes. Well, live and learn. What have you done? Did it work? Uh, unless we permanently fried his... Classified. I saw my dad. I know it was him. Did you get his location? Yes, but it wasn't a good place. I think he was trying to warn me. Focus your thoughts, young deputy, as the... As the lens of Mickey focuses photons from your external form. That almost made sense. What was the nature of your father's warning? Dad was saying something. Two words over and over. Tat. Men. Tatmen... The planet Mentat. Attention, all carbon-based bipeds, and Tar Gibbons. Report to the flight deck. - Something new has cropped up. - Oh, boy. Galactic Patrol Headquarters has ordered us to go to Plant... Make that "Planet Zambreno." What? Why? Their intelligence says it'll lead us to B'kr. B'kr has threatened to destroy the galaxy. - What? - The whole galaxy? - Is that even possible? - Yes. We think so. I mean, we think so. That's why we can't wait any longer for Rod's father to contact us. We have to find him at once. Only he can stop B'kr's evil plan. If finding my dad is what can stop B'kr, then we have to go to the Mentat planet. Except, as Galactic Patrol Officers, we must follow official orders. We must go to Zambreno. If we refuse to follow proper orders, we will be charged as renegades. Then your orders aren't proper because it's so obvious that there's only one thing to do. What is that, young deputy? What the Galactic Patrol is always supposed to do. The right thing. But that would... Make each and every one of us... - Plink. - What she said. Renegades against the Patrol. Renegades who can save my dad. Uh... And the galaxy. - Ah! - Yeah. Okay. Yeah. Phil, plot a course. New course already set. Full seed... Speed ahead to the Mentat. And those are the officers that make up the crew of the Starship Ferkel. And that's Daddy, but I do not know why he's dressed like an alien. Mmm-mmm. Um... All right. Well, let's ask. Gee P'Gee, why is my Art dressed in an alien uniform? As founder of the Galactic Patrol, Commander Art Allbright is an honored officer, and true hero. Wow! Daddy's a hero! I bet he'll have a lot of great stories to tell us when we see him. When you see him? When he comes back. Because he promised Roddie he would. Don't you remember? Every day. Oh. Oh. Lackey! I didn't do it! I mean, yes, Leader Zupreme? Get me my number-three sharpener. Uh, right away, sir. Something has molted its skin. That's just my human grubling mask, you wormhole, from when I passed myself off as Billy Becker to go to Rod Allbright's pathetic school. No. No. Please, no. No, sir. Hello, Lackey. I'm your new best friend. I don't like it. It's scary. It's pathetically ugly. I know. Ah, it made my spikes itch like... Take this. What? Why change course to... Unless... It has to be. Allbright. They'll lead me to him, and I'll get that final piece of information of where exactly to place my Time Trap. Yes! Grab the throttle, Lackey. Yeah. Aye, aye. Full speed ahead, baby! Yeah! Let's go, Lackey! Allbright, we're coming for you. That's a whole new alien planet. But it's not a place. It's a plant? The Mentat is the oldest living organism in the galaxy. Whoa! I'm proud to say I have an uncle who claims our family trees are related. Oh, boy. Mmm-hmm. Here we go. Oh, yeah. Captain Grakker? You want a piece of me? You wouldn't know what to do with an angry Blue. Let's dance! Uh, perhaps something a little less in-your-face? Huh? You eyeballing me, weirdo? Remember to keep it controlled. What are they doing? Changing his behavior module. Yeah. Oh. Captain Grakker? Why, hello there, princess. How you doin'? Not so well. Oh, shucks. Since we do not know what to expect in the Mentat, perhaps the best module to choose is that which is unexpected. Ah! The remote-control module. I am, uh, A-okay with that there, missy. - Oh, yeah, right. Yep. - Mmm-hmm. Okay. Eenie, meenie, miney, and... No. All uninvited entities must halt. State your business. I am Captain Grakker of the Galactic Patrol, and I state that you state your authority to ask me to state my business before you state yours. A touch too by-the-book. Aah... I'm Arly Bung, Chief of Security. Is this your vessel? Why? What? Ha! Oh. Yeah. You got that right, buddy. The good old Starship Ferkel. Yeah! Well, then raise your manipulatory appendages. There's an all-quadrant alert about you Ferkel renegades. I'm locking you up till patrol can ship you to the Alcatron Prison planet. How many more renegades are on board? Yeah, that is a good question. Not bad for a fish. Pompous, foolhardy... Ah! Cleverly straightforward. Spit it out, Captain! There are no renegades, that is Galactic Patrol, defying proper orders currently on the Ferkel. Good boy, Captain. Now move. So, this way? - Yes. - Yeah? Excuse me, fellas. Yeah, move out of the way, bud. You should probably think about pruning. Well, that branched off a bit from the truth, but not a lot. Phil, activate the teleporter. We have to rescue him. Good to go. No. We can't. What? If we go after them, Arly Bung will lock us up too. We need a plan to rescue our friend and still be free to find my dad. The young deputy is correct. First thing, we'll need a map. Phil, can you access one? Does the sap rise in the spring? How does anyone get around in there? It's a snap pea. The Mentat has its own teleporter network. Can you hook up the Ferkel's teleporter to the Mentat's network? Then we could teleport anywhere inside it. Anywhere that doesn't have teleportation blockage beams. My dad's in there, somewhere. Wherever he is, that's where we need to go. We cannot go. Madame Pong is correct. If she and I accompany you, Mentat Sensors will alert Chief Bung to the presence of additional Ferkel renegades. However, the Mentat Sensors are not set for humans. We understand. We can do this, Phil. Got it. But I'm gonna need more technical science-y things like, uh, co-ordinates. Young deputy, ask yourself, what would I do? You'd probably say something I wouldn't understand. But half of the time... You'd say something like... Like? Like... "To find that which is missing, young deputy, "you must first lose yourself." What? Tat men. Tat men. Mentat. Spa font! Phil, I know the co-ordinates. Plink! Whoa! That'd make such a great ride. No way. Is this the right place? I think so. I think... I think I can see better with my eyes closed. He's starting to sound like Tar Gibbons. Keep going straight, Rod. We'll keep you from bumping into things. Something doesn't feel right. You mean about Rod's dad being here? I mean, Rod's right. How could Uncle Art be here for years without letting his family know he's all right? Which means he could be here... but not all right, right? - Right? - No. To the left. It's around here somewhere. I can feel it. Rod, look out! Rod! Come on. Run! Run! What is that? I don't know. Just keep going. Go. Run! Go! - This way! - Go, go. Rod, look out! What the heck was that? Root ball, obviously. It must be how the Mentat plant sends messages through its whole root system. It's gonna take a while to unravel this mess. We don't have a while. I've got to... Get me out of here! There's no time. - Climb, Rod. Climb! - Go! - Rod... - Rod! He's gone. Dad. Okay, here goes nothing. Surprisingly sturdy for shrubbery. Ah. Whoa! Wow! Well played, Bung. However, may I say you are not acting in accordance with Galactic ordinance 51.6475.2b. You must free me at once. Silence, Friskian. I know that, but I am acting in full accordance with Galactic Ordinance 432.75.8969. Aha! But in doing so, you are violating Galactic Ordinance 14. Oh, yeah. But that only applies in Dimension X, and we are in Dimension Q. Argh! Boogers, boogers, boogers! There's no way out for you. Yes, there is. Who said that? Said what? That... That there's a way out. There is? Someone just said so. Then it must have been us. Okay, enough. Show yourselves. Pay attention, because we're all around you. Dad. What are you... What are you doing? You're trying to reach this control thing? Rod? Dad. You've grown. You're... You're older. I've been trapped in a moment of time. - How long? - Five years. It's okay, Dad. I found you now. Yeah. You did. You did. Oh. You're Mentat tree roots. We are? We mean, yes, we are. Cousin Phil reached out to us. Phillogenous esk Piemondum? Uh, you know, Phil? You guys are related to him? He said we plants have to stick together, even if you think that's sappy. You are definitely related. But how are you gonna help me escape? You'll have to uproot yourself, Graktain Capper, but we'll make it easy-peasy. Ooh! Open sesame seed! Uh, hey. You, uh... You got a license for that? No? You know, I'm just gonna... Whoa! You guys related, or... Ah, boogers! Ah, welcome back, Captain. Phil, where are the Earthlings? Beets me. And the Roots are all tapped out. I was scanning the grublings deep in the lower tunnels and then they plum vanished. There must be an energy field down there blocking our scanners. And putting a real strain on the teleporter. There's nothing we can do to find them. We've come to the end. So we must start at the beginning. Of course. Uncle Art? Elspeth? Mickey? Look at you! We were all so worried about you. Well, I thought I'd be gone for a week or two, a month, at most, but at least you guys are all together. Mom. The twins. They're okay, Dad. Good. Oh! Oh, Mickey! Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Careful. Slowly. Slowly. Thank you. This needs to be kept in radiation shielding. In case it switches on again. What is it, anyway? What started this whole mess... A Micro Time Trap booby-trapped by B'kr. B'kr? Mentat security alert. It might be for us. Patrol thinks we're renegades. Well, we've gotta move fast. We can't let any of this get in the wrong manipulatory appendages. "Appendages"? Alien. Where are you, Grakker? Okay. Here we are. Why did B'kr booby-trap that thing? Because I'm his worst enemy. Isn't everybody? We used to be best friends. No way. We worked together for years to build the Chrono-negatronic Retrolocitor. Is that like, a time machine? Ultimately, yes. Why? Because I wanted to get back to the place I was born. Oh, kids, uh, grab the backpacks. They're, uh, underneath the beakers. On which planet? Same as all of you. Earth. Hold it. You're not an alien. What? Of course not. Oh, yes. Then where were you born, exactly? Atlantis. Atlantis, Georgia? Seriously? Wait. Atlantis, the lost continent? Yes. Home of Earth's first civilization. Where I was born 35,000 years ago. Ha! Found it. I found the energy block. There's no way to know what's concealed behind it. Captain, unidentified running objects closing in. Could be hostile beans. Acknowledged. Uncle Art, you look pretty good for someone who's 35,000 years old. That's just when I was born. Actually, I spent so much time travelling through space in hibernation pods, I'm only a couple of years older than your Aunt Gwen. Why go back in time to Atlantis? Because I wanted to go home. See, for me, my first space voyage only lasted a year, but back on Earth, 1,000 years had passed. Atlantis was long gone. Wow. Is that why you ended up working with B'kr? Well, he said that he could help me build my machine, that together, we could be travelers through time. But he lied. That's all B'kr does. Not entirely true, Pudge-Boy. Who are you? Your old school friend, Roddie. Recognize the pretty face? Billy Becker? B'kr. Hello, Allbright. Been a while. Madame Pong, I saw B'kr. He's with an Insectoroid. They're in the area, hidden by the energy block. If Rod's father is being protected by that energy field, and B'kr has found him... Then we can no longer stay hidden. Suits me fine. I'm no shrinking violet. It's time we took some blooming action. Activate the debigginer. Okay. Forget what I said about not shrinking. So, this is where you stashed everything you snatched from my lab. Our lab. Right. The good old days. What are you doing here, Billy? Looking for the one last thing your old man kept from me. That won't work here. I've set up an energy field that blocks all scanners. Regular scanners, maybe, but not my psychic scanner. So, Allbrights, who's first? Ugh! I hate messes. Messy mess. Grakker. You can't hide from me. Psychic link. That has to be how you found your father. Am I right, or am I right? Everyone comfy now? Love these prisoner tabs. Bet you're real happy you invented them now, aren't ya? Did you tell Rod about one of your other brilliant inventions? You are pathetic. Chrono-nega-blah-blah-blah. Going back to old home. Boo-hoo! It's called the Chrono-negatronic Retrolocitor, Billy. - Chrono-negatronic... - Get to the point. He's already seen it in action. I've been trapped here for five years! I knew it. I knew you were up to something back then. Now, what about my Time Trap? Did you tell Rod about that one? Rod, I... I wanted to travel through time, but B'kr wanted to trap a single moment of it in an endless loop. Imagine a Mega Time Trap so big and so powerful it could capture the entire galaxy in an endless moment, just like your dad was. So pointless. Yeah. One moment repeating forever? That would suck big time. Depends on the moment. So chaotic. I hate this planet. What is... No! This is Chief Bung. I've just seen the... Knowing precisely where to set my Mega Time Trap was the one thing I couldn't figure out. But your dad could, and did. Dad, don't tell him. That's the thing. He can't. He knew how important that information was to me, and how easily I could get him to tell me. So he blocked it out of his mind... ...and placed it someplace he thought I'd never find it. Ah. Two brains with two different swirly bits, except for a blank bit in your dad's brain and one new bit of information that has been jammed into yours. You know what that means, Roddie? No? To complete my plan, all I need is your brain. I hope you don't mind. Struggle all you want. Your prisoner tabs are in my control. Leader Zupreme! B'kr, drop your blaster by order of the Galactic Patrol. Blast them to quarks! Focus the destructor beam. Take out those prisoner tabs. Deconstructor focused. I hope I don't miss. Nice shot. Barely singed him. Maintain fire. Protect the grublings. Quick, quick. Get out. Go. Go. Go. Rigging teleporter systems online. Where's my dad? Get down! Get him! Get who, sir? Allbright. Who else? Ferkel is in position to beam them up. On your mark, Captain. I almost got them. Almost got them. Got them! Yeah! All right, all right. Okay. Not that Allbright. The other one, you bug-brain! Sorry. Take him to the tunnel. No. You have to save my dad. B'kr's personal bubble field is blocking our teleporter. We can't give up on our commander. We have to find a way. B'kr, throw down your blaster. Release Ah-rit at once. Grakker, no. Protect Rod. Forget about me, okay? I'm gonna be fine. Just get Roddie... Good idea, Grakker. Oh, Roddie. I know you're listening. That setting just stunned your dad. Next one, and he'll be flatlined. So get out here now. Captain Grakker, send me out. I'll do whatever it takes to save my dad. So will I. My Captain, if these grublings truly will do anything that is required, there is one last thing to try. Perilous, to be sure, but possible even so. Starting a countdown, Roddie. You've got 10 seconds to save your dad's life. You're serious? You can actually do that? - Ten... - That's so messed up. - Nine. - Rod? Elspeth? - Eight. - You both understand the terrible risk... - Seven. - ...and that I cannot guarantee success. - Six. - Whatever it takes to save my dad. - Five. - Whatever it takes to stop B'kr. Four. Three, a-two, a-one. B'kr. You win. It's what I do. "It's what I do." You got what you came for, B'kr. Release Ah-rit. Hello, Pudge-Boy. I can't wait to dig into that pathetic brain of yours to snag the prize inside. There are no signs of neuron combustion. Her brain is not fried. But I'm not seeing any indication of any higher brain function at all. Oh! Re-setting for Earthlings. All good. Rod? Mickey, I'm Els... Els... What say you, young deputy? Mickey, it's me, Rod. I'm here. Oh, this is so not right. Uh, you mean, so cool. Two minds in one brain. How can they both fit in there? It's not like Rod's very... Rod, stop it. You stop it. Oh. I am gratified to have succeeded in building a psychic bridge between you two. So am I, Tar. Oh! Commander Allbright. It's good to have you back onboard the, uh, Ferkel. Rod? Rod. I'm here, Dad. Son, I never meant for you to be drawn into any of this. - Elspeth? - Present. I promise I'll make this right. Everyone to the flight deck. This crew has a new mission. Guys? Guys? Hello? Hello? Anyone there? Uh, I don't know how to turn it off. Well, Grakker, don't... I'll get someone. Don't leave! Argh! So, where is the brightest member of the crew? - Plink? - Plink! Hey. What am I? Chopped kindling? Phillogenous esk Piemondum, so glad to see you haven't crashed the ship yet. Not for lack of trying. Might wanna ease up on the late-night chlorophylls. - Whoa. - Okay. Yep. Mmm-hmm. Rod, pay attention. I am not clumsy. They're your feet. Rod! Strange creatures. Young deputies. Sorry, Tar Gibbons. Sorry's not the half of it. Hey, hey, hey. This won't last long, you two. All right. Attention, everyone. We will stop B'kr. We will save the galaxy, and we will do so before B'kr has a chance to realize that all he has is Rod's body, and decides to... And what'll B'kr do if he finds out my body's mindless? - Well... - Commander. I think it best if you share the whole situation for your crew. Probably not the best idea. Uh, definitely, uh, not for the best. There could be screaming. - I think we already know. - Even I know. When B'kr finds out he doesn't have Rod's mind with the information about where to put his Mega Time Trap, he could... Throw my body out an airlock. He could, but remember, B'kr always needs an audience. Millions have wept. What he's more likely to do is capture more hostages. Mom. The twins. That's not gonna happen because we are gonna get to them before he does. Phil, if you would. What do you mean, "if I'm wood"? - Plink! - Of course I'm wood. Oh. Got it. Never mind. Not that I have one. The Ferkel is go. Mmm... Just a second. We are go now. Any time. And now. Why won't you work? Think of this as a little sneak preview. A little tidbit on how all the Allbrights are gonna be screaming in terror forever. Ah! And all thanks to you, Roddie. How's it make you feel, Pudge-Boy? Uh, Leader Zupreme. What now, bug-brain? About what you said about us looking for a brain... Get out of here. Go. No brain activity? What? Argh! You sure Madame Pong said that's food? Well, technically, "ingestible energy compounds "not likely to cause severe digestive upset "in non-paper-eating species." Mmm. Not too bad. Oh, a bit spicy. Yeah. That's... That's a lot spicy, actually. It sort of tastes like... Fire! Fire! Mmm. Water! I dare you. You're out of your mind. Obviously. How are you two holding up? One of us is, Uncle Art. And it's not her. Rod, don't you dare. Rod. - Rod. - Stand down. Both of you. Rod, Elspeth, listen to me. I know how hard this must be for both of you, but Tar has given me something that just might help. A dimensional window of pure forandus. What does it do? I'm not sure. Let's find out. Nothing's happening. Where are we? Probably in Tar's mind. He's good at creating psychic delusions. Wherever we are... I'm just glad you're here. I missed you so much. When we get home, son, I'm staying put. Really, Dad? I mean, you're commander of a starship. If I had a ship like this, I'd wanna go everywhere. I know the feeling. And when I had the chance, I did. Then I met your mother. Fifteen years ago, when I finally figured out what B'kr was up to, I took everything I could from the lab and hid it in the Mentat. B'kr came searching for me, of course, so Tar Gibbons helped me hide on Earth. I landed in good old Seldom Seen. That's where I met your mom. And we fell in love. That's when I decided that I'd been exploring long enough. So I gave it all up for my new home, my new family. I was content at last. Then why did you leave us? Well, that night, the Patrol sent a ship to warn me that B'kr was on his way to Earth to search for me. To keep you all safe, I couldn't let B'kr connect any of you to me, so I had to leave right away. I'll come back, Rod. I promise. Why'd you go to the Mentat? Well, my plan was to work there for a few weeks, to come up with something new to stop B'kr. Instead, I got caught in his Micro Time Trap. Until you. You found me. You saved me. Uh, we're back. More or less. Why are you wearing those strange alien uniforms, and where's Rod? We should probably all come inside first. "All"? The Ferkel! Yay! The Ferkel? Wow! Oh, Art! - Sorry. - Daddy! I'm so sorry, love. - Oh, my gosh. - Look at you. Hey! You're so big. We are witnessing that which brings joy to the universe. A family gathered together in a bunch like that, it makes me weep like a willow. It is truly humbling to see the heartfelt ties that binds all Allbrights. Until they start talking. Hey, hey, hey! Mmm. Mmm-mmm. Mmm-mmm. Where have you been? How could you do this to us? Listen to me. I will tell you everything, but now is not the time. No. You have been gone for five years. This is the time. And Rod... Where's Rod? Tell me. Elspeth, do you know where he is? Hi, Mom. Long story short, I'm Rod. What? It's complicated, but it's true. Rod's mind is sharing Elspeth's brain. But how? I'll tell you all later. We've gotta go. A dimensional rift has opened. Oh, no. B'kr. - Okay, guys. Okay. - What do we do? Excuse me. We've gotta... We gotta go, okay? - Let's go. - Stay with Mommy and Daddy, okay? We've gotta go now. Prisoners, surrender. Identify yourself. Arly Bung, Mentat Chief of Security. I'm here for Captain Grakker, and I'm arresting all the rest of his accomplices. - Art, what is that thing? - Chief, wait. These Earthlings are innocent. They're being threatened by B'kr himself. Aw, ask me if I care. - What? - Because I don't. Elspeth, Mickey, take the twins and run. Go, go, go! Oh, air-breathers. So predictable. - Ah, boogers! - Great. Now I'm a frozen vegetable. Billy Becker? B'kr. I see you've met my Mentat spy. She's a true fish out of water. No, no, no. None of this is real. I'm as real as it gets, baby. One of you is gonna tell me where you've hidden Rod's mind because every hour you make me wait, I'm gonna drop one of you losers down a bottomless black hole. How could anyone wanna help B'kr freeze the galaxy in a moment of time? That's so stupid it hurts. Someone has to do something. The galaxy is a hot mess. Asteroids are slamming into planets, supernovas popping off at random, a whole gazillion stars colliding! But B'kr's promised total order. No more chaos, no more change. Oh, look, everyone, it's Angry Bung. Things will finally stay the same. The same and the same and the same. And in that one infinitely clean and tidy moment, I'll be living the dream forever. Sounds like someone's a few kernels short of a cob. At least we've got lots of time to come up with an escape plan. The nearest black hole to Earth is nearly 3,000 light years away. Wrong. March with me. - And a-one, two. - Come on. Stay behind me, guys. Come on. A little faster now. - Stay close. - Giddy up! Haroop. Haroop. Haroop. Haroop. Anyone wanna plead for mercy before we take a little stroll all the way over to my favorite black hole? What black hole? The one on the other side of this interdimensional portal. March! Gwen! Ah, humans are so slow. Okey-dokey. Here I come, mama. Here we go. What on Earth, or wherever, are you? I'm your worst daydream. "Nightmare." - Uh... - Really? Huh? - How many times? - Sorry. - Uh, sorry, sir. - I forgot your debigginer... Thank you. What a waste. Grublings don't need prisoner tabs. If they try to escape... Well... Just sit on them... - until they pop. - Ew! Popping grublings. Always seems to make me laugh. Close the portal and move the Ferkel to the lab. If anyone escapes, blast them to quarks. Gotta get to the Ferkel, please. Lackey, hurry up. I'm trying. I'm trying. I don't have all day. Yeah. Lackey, the best The rest of you, welcome to the Doomstar. It may be a little crowded until we start tossing one or two of them out the airlock. Eric, Linda, stay close to Mom. Everyone's gonna be okay. And people say I'm delusional. Hold on. One second. Oh, don't worry about Sleeping Beauty. I'll be sure to thaw out the Pudge-Boy before I activate my Mega Time Trap. I mean, why make a moment of total triumph last forever if you can't share it with your defeated foes? Lackey hates the Leader Zupreme. "Lackey do this, Lackey do that." Lackey needs a vacation. But Leader Zupreme doesn't care. If it wasn't for the bugs. Bugs... Oh, the Leader Zupreme does give me bugs. Zlurpy, luscious bugs. Ugh. Lackey loves the Leader Zupreme. Now to get the Galactic Patrolz out of the Ferkelz. So, fun fact. My ship's orbiting a ginormous black hole right at the edge of the event horizon. Linda and Eric, do either of you know what happens if you get swallowed up by a black hole? Squishy, squishy. Don't you dare bully my children. If you've got something to say, B'kr, you say it to me. Okay, Mom and Dad, here's the real question. Do you love these little space rats enough to tell me where Rod's tiny mind is hiding? So you can what? Destroy the galaxy? I like to think that I'm preserving it forever. How about it, Mom? No idea. Right, then. Who's first? You stay away from my family. Someone needs a nap. Now, where was I? Oh, yeah. Tar, I have to tell B'kr I'm here, but Elspeth's blocking me. Not yet, young Rod. B'kr won't act until he's certain he's inflicted maximum cruelty on his victims. For now, we must trust in Phil. Phil? He has a plan to gain our freedom. Hey, you with the thorax. Yeah? Check out this bi-pedal meat monstrosity next to me. - Yeah? - Meat. Wait. What'd you call me? He's a Friskian Fighter. They're famous for being the goofiest clowns in the galaxy. I'm... What? Have you heard animals have this thing called the nervous system? Laughable, I know. Who needs to be more nervous. Am I right? But in Friskians, their nervous system makes them, get this, completely programmable. You can make them do anything you want. Phil, to avoid your own death, you should stop now. I'm just getting started, you hilarious hunk of ambulatory protein. See for yourself. Press that big blue behavior adjustor button on his control pad there and he'll do anything you say. Totally. - Huh? - Totally correct. Huh... The control pad on my Ferkel remote contr... Uh, behavior adjustor thing. Phil, how cruel of you to expose poor Grakker's weakness. Yeah. You can make him sing, dance, tell jokes. Your boss would love that, yes? - Probably give you a big reward. - Huh? Something like... Like bugz? Just what I was thinking. Yummy! Oh, no. Don't press the second blue button... which focuses the energy beam on me. This one? Oh, my bad. Hey, coochie, coochie, coochie. - Huh? - Meet Mr. Goof. Ah! So much better. But it was useful in case some human saw me. Ah. Wakey, wakey. Art! Gwen, no. No. Aw, family reunions. So sticky sweet they make my teeth hurt. Tar Gibbons, B'kr's gonna drop Mom into the black hole. I have to tell him what he wants to know. No, young deputy. There is one final thing to try. If you can distract B'kr... Ah, I could do this all day. If only we had more time. He's distracted. He's distracted. Then listen carefully, young Rod and young Elspeth. Ah. Ah! You know what's even better than tossing Spacemom out the airlock into a giant black hole? Starting a countdown to tossing Spacemom out the... And so on. No. Ugh! Gross. Disgusting. Oh, okay. Sick. Dirty. Trash. Trash. There's trash everywhere. Everywhere. Okay. Ah, look. Oh, you want to play like that, do you? Yeah, yeah. Oh, boy. I got it. I am building his confidence. Obviously. I see you are somewhat wise in the ways of warrior science. You are an almost-worthy foe. Ha-ha! Eh. I claim victory! What is that? I love you. Save our children. Aw, I love you too. Please. And don't worry. The kids will be fine. The black hole will look after them. Fly swatted. You can't knock the wind out of me, Friskian. Insects don't have lungs! Rod, wake up! Wake up, Rod. Rod, wake up. Rod! Wake up! Rod? Elspeth? I'm back in my body. And I'm alone in mine. Yay! What now? I'm gonna need your hats. I'll get the twins back to the bridge before B'kr sees we're gone. Come on, let's go. - Come on. - I can help too. Those prisoner tabs. You know how to use them? Yeah, look. And I think I can turn them all off at once. Get them ready. What are you gonna do? Just watch me. Ugh! Dusty. Mom and Dad, this will all end if you just tell me where you've hidden Rod's mind. Never. Argh! "Never." All right, kids. Everyone with me now. Ten, nine, eight, seven, six... Where is Mickey? Where's Mickey? No! Oh. Plink! Plink! You've been Plinked. Galactic Patrol, prepare the debigginer, and prepare to teleport aboard the Ferkel. Get him! Art. Frizzim spezzack! You're making everything slippery. Sticky! I love you, Gwendolyn Jean. You better, because you are in so much trouble, mister. I'm so sorry. Just stop it. Enough! I will blast the next biped who moves. Space larva, get off my fire. Spacemom, get back in the airlock. - I am not even gonna start a countdown. - Ugh! And, Dad, I'm gonna shoot you just because. Hey! You want my brain? Then come and get it. Die! Argh, I'm gonna get you. Watch them, or I will shoot you out the airlock next. Total flight control restored. Young Mickey is proving to be as resourceful as a Pluvian Drap. Get that grubling an Expellerator. Yeah! Ugh! Stop making a mess! No. No. All right! That was awesome. Holy cow. - Oh, no. - No, no. Gwen, get Arly out of the way. Come on. Quick. How do you tap into this thing? Art! What's happening? B'kr's blaster shattered the controls. What's happening? We're falling into a black hole. Roddie, you know you can't defeat me because I always win. This time, B'kr, you don't stand a chance against me. I could do this all day, but you're out of time. Soon the entire galaxy will be dropped in a constant loop, creating and recreating my inevitable victory. And that time is now! Hey, Billy. Think fast! No! No! No! No! No! - No! No! No! - You lose. No! No! No! - Rod. - I'm okay. Where's B'kr? Let's just say I gave him a time-out. What are you doing? We lost main propulsion. You and Mom have to get everybody off this ship now. - What? - No. Art, no! I can buy you a minute, maybe two, but you have to go now. No. There's no way I'm leaving you. Art, I am not losing you all over again. No way, Uncle Art. We're with you, Commander Allbright. You don't all understand. If I take my hands off these controls... We won't last five seconds. We're all going home together. The Galactic Patrol is here. Everyone, get back. It's too dangerous here. Get back. Get back. Ah-rit and Rod must stay at the controls until the last possible second. We have to get all the others out immediately. The teleporter can't handle the load. I am a Friskian Fighter. If a mission's not impossible, I'm not interested. I'm staying with you. Art! No! It's okay, son. You're gonna make it. - No! - Yes. - No! - Still yes. - No! No! - Let's get this joker back where he belongs. No! No! Two down, one to go. Did you ever finish that sci-fi movie you started that night? Dad, I'm living it. You're a good man to have by my side, deputy. I'm proud of you. Entry to portal. Let's get ready to blast out of here. We're losing it. All right, on my mark. Put all the power to the thrusters. Captain Grakker, activate long-range teleporter to get those two home. I can't get a lock. We did the right thing. We saved the galaxy. We saved our family. The black hole is pulling us down. We're out of time. Now, Phil. Now! No, no, no. You can't leave them. Engine failure in three seconds. Three, two, one. Here we go. I can't hold on any longer. It's now or never. - Do you have them? - No. We lost them. Oh, wait, wait, wait. I have them. Yeah! Daddy's back. Hey, come here, guys. I got out of this pickle once before by being as cool as a cucumber, and I can do it again. Hold on to your seed-pods. We're going in. Oh, my. Nailed it. Oh, no. My family, my friends, I thank each and every one of you for never giving up hope. From now on, no more alien adventures for me. I'm staying home. Like Aunt Petunia always said, "Home is where the heart of palm is." Cheers, everyone. - There you go. - Cheers. Easy, Pong. Paper cuts. Whoa! Hey. - Hmm? - Is that my homework? Uh... Classified!
