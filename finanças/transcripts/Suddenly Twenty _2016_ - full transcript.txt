[Parn] I was born in the post-war period. [wailing] At the time, many things were developed. People were well off. It was a time of new inventions. There were many things to do and plenty of opportunity. -I've loved to sing since I was young. -[inaudible] Everyone said I had a good voice. So I thought of joining the singing competition, as I wanted to be a singer. Where's Parnward? No idea. Who is going to sing, then? Well, you come with me! [Parn] But I couldn't make it... How many times do I have to tell you not to sing? [Parn] ...because my parents hated the idea of me singing. They said singing for money was no good. Then there was a guy who liked me, so I decided to run away with him, thinking perhaps he could help me follow my dream of becoming a singer. But I ended up doing nothing with my life. Bad things kept happening. Terrible things. And the worst thing was... One hot tea. What? ...I got quite old by the time I realized all this. One hot tea! [sighs] [amplified] What? One hot tea! Oh, that's all! Wait! [Parn grumbles] Do you know what helped me go through all this? What are you smiling at? My son. Okay, everyone. Today, let's talk about the elderly. Let's start with a question. Why do young people think older people are annoying? -[snoring] -No one? If you're not going to answer, I'll assign you a report instead. Yes? Old people are forgetful, and they don't admit it. [old man] Hold on! I ordered hot tea, not coffee. Coffee! Don't get on my nerves. I ordered-- Quiet! Just drink it! It's the same hot stuff! [huffs] Old people also fart loudly. [passes wind softly] Who was that? Gosh, the smell! Just shit it out if you're gonna fart like that. [passes wind] Hmm. I better not catch you doing it. Yes? It's such a waste to get old. Be careful. You might not die of old age. I'd rather die before I ever get old. [Chian] Phong must be very smart. He's got a Ph.D. And he's an associate professor! Right, of course. -How many times do I have to tell you? -Oh... -So tiring! -Hmm. Well, well! [chuckles] If it's so tiring, why don't you just stop talking about him? Is there any day you don't brag about your son? So what? Is my son's success getting on your wrinkly nerves? [Parn clicks tongue] You keep bragging about your son being an assistant professor. Hmm? So why does he let his mother wear rotten shoes to work, then? He can't compare to my son, who works in the US and sends me plane tickets so I can go visit him. [chuckles] Wait. Where is it? Look here. I just took a photo for my visa application. Isn't it beautiful? -[Parn groans] -[Chian chuckles] Yeah, it is. Beautiful? Great for a funeral portrait. [grumbles] Shut up, you old hag! Hmm! Chian, can I have one Americano, please? One Americano, my ass! Whenever you've come here, you've only ordered Thai black tea. Now you act all posh and want to order an Americano? [cackles] What a snobbish hag! Am I getting on your wrinkly nerves? -[groans] -[both arguing indistinctly] Cut it out. Hey, stop it! -[arguing indistinctly] -[squealing] [Chian grunts] [groaning] [exclaims] Granny Parn did this again, didn't she? [winces] No, it wasn't her. Don't blame it on her. -Hmm? -[winces] I just don't get it. What do you see in her? She's got a big mouth and an awful personality. -[Parn] Talking behind my back, huh? -[Chian] Huh? [Chian chuckles nervously] Your foul mouth, that is why you can't get a husband! You may have to live off your parents forever! [stuttering] Look what you did to my dad! Ah, here, for you! [chuckles] Thank you. Aren't you going to apologize? Why should I? He got in the way. I'm going now. Wait, Ms. Parn. I'll take you home. No need. I can manage on my own. [Joy] Let her be. Even hell won't take her in. Ho-ho! Watch your mouth. Aside from your ugly face, you still have a foul mouth. That's why you can't get a husband as a 30-something. It's not that I couldn't find one. I'm just afraid to run into a mother-in-law like her. Don't tell me you don't want a husband. Dad! Don't argue. Look at your face! It's all swollen. You know you're allergic to rambutans. Why do you still eat them? Stop eating. You have to wait till the water boils before you put in the fish. Sorry. Why are you standing here? Move. Move. Just go over there. Do not stir when boiling fish. It'll have a fishy smell. How many times do I have to tell you? What a dumbass! Where are you going? To an audition. Audition? What audition? I thought you made me a promise. You're to play music as a hobby only. Look at your sister. She's been reading books every day. She graduated years ago and still can't get a job. A job is difficult to find, Mom. It's not difficult if you get to the interview on time. Boom! Enough. Stop it! What is it so good about playing music? Is it good with all this dancing stuff? Hey! Talk to your son nicely. What is so bad about playing music, huh? [sighs] [chuckles] Ah, my dear, take this money and get something to eat, okay? Granny... Just take it, dear. Can I have 1,000 baht more? Huh? Just the chicken with basil leaves and rice already costs 50 baht. Control your spending! Thank you, Grandma. [Parn fawning] What a child! [chuckles] [sighs] You're his mother. You should understand him. Sorry. What's wrong with being a singer? Hey, Bam! You're a woman, so dress properly. Your shorts! They almost show your genitals. If they didn't show my genitals, how could you know I'm a woman? You brat! I wonder where she got this mouth from. Sorry. [Phong] Um... Are you okay? Hmm? [sighs] Don't mind her. She's always like this. I can't stand her anymore. I could manage it if it was a matter of the house we're staying at, but... Thank you. I'm going off now, Mom. Okay. Work hard, son. Yes. -[car door closes] -[engine starts] What kind of wife are you? When your husband goes out to work, you should see him out. Sorry. -[drum sticks tapping] -[Boom] One, two, three, four...

Okay. How can you say that? What about our Huai Khwang band? Screw the band! It's hopeless. Watch your mouth! I am! What kind of band name is Huai Khwang? You'll never be famous! -Come on, Nana. Don't do this. -Hey! She stays here, and you guys get lost before I have you beaten up! Fuck off! Shit! [Toey] Fuck off! [singing off-key] ♪ Today is a good day ♪ [all singing pop song] -[high-tempo pop music playing] -[girls chanting] So kids nowadays can't sing anymore? I think they're all right. We just need to fine-tune them a bit, and it should be fine. But if you still don't like them, I have a few more. Like over there, the Six-Packs. I'm out. What a waste of time! [sighs] [Boy] Hey, wait up! [assistant] Nut! [sighs] Nut, what type do you prefer? If you don't choose now, we'll fall behind schedule. [sighs] I want a singer who can really sing, you know? Not just someone getting into character. Ever heard of the old-school singers? They sing with their real inner feelings. I understand, but I don't know where to find someone like that. I don't think they exist anymore. If so, it would only be those old people. Then let's go together this weekend to see how a real singer sings. He's so handsome, even when he gets angry. You like him? Such a self-centered prick! Let me handle him. He's not into a homo like you. Hey, I'm your senior. Nut, wait up! Hello, beautiful. Don't patronize me! Which pair will it be? I've seen you several times already. You like this one, don't you? Want me to put it into a plastic bag? How much? 399, please. [clears throat] How about 99? What? I can't make a living with such a low offer! What the hell? So deal or no deal? No, and I'm not selling to you! Go somewhere else. Please, madam! No one will give you business with such a high price. Business will go away soon! Stingy hag! [Parn] Who are you calling stingy? No one. Who? Why don't you turn the light on? I've got such poor eyesight. Nok! [sighs] -[Bam] Mom! Stay with us, Mom! -[Boom] Hurry! -[Boom] Mom... -[Parn] Nok... She's regaining consciousness. [both] Mom! [Boom] How are you feeling, Mom? Didn't I tell you to do some exercise? You don't listen to me at all... What... What do you want? Your husband? Well, go to her. What are you whispering? Tell me. Tell me what you want. We have lots of fruit here. Just tell us what you want. -Mom. -Everyone is worried about you. What is it? Nok wants you to leave for a minute. [Bam] Quiet! Mom will get hurt. What? You were very lucky this time. The surgery went well. Nothing serious to worry about. If you don't want to be a widower, you have to take better care of your wife. She could die if there's a lot of stress. [Bam] Don't you love Mom? Mom almost died because of Granny. But we can't do this to Granny. What's wrong with a nursing home? There are people there to take care of her. She'll have food and friends too. If it's so great, why don't you go in her place? Dad, what do you think? [sighs] [rustling] Here, let me take that for you. You go and rest first. Your favorite soap opera is on. Ms. Sompiew Munaum is a wilting 89-year-old woman. She has to stay in her backyard. I'm taking a shower first. I'll come back to cook you guys a meal. Mom, as soon as Nok gets better, I'll bring you back. Hmm. Just take good care of your wife. If something goes wrong again, you can't blame me. Are you okay, Ms. Parn? [Supha] Parn? It's really you. I thought I'd never see you again. I'm Supha from Petch Market. [stuttering] Uh, you've got the wrong person. Of course not. I'll never forget you. My mother and I take you and your daughter in. She saved you from the streets and gave you work. But you stole my mother's recipe and opened up another stall to compete with her. How could you do this? I've lived such hardship because of you! My mother died! Enough. Stop it. Stop! [crying] Go ahead! Do as you wish. I have no regrets. Even if I could turn back time, I'd still do the same. I do everything for my boy. Because of me, he's now an assistant professor at a university. There is no better mother than me. My son knows it well. [cell phone ringing] [sighs] [Boom] Hello? Granny! Yes, dear? Let's go out for dinner. Why don't you eat at home? I don't want to see Bam. Brothers and sisters should love each other. I'll be gone soon. Don't make me worry. I wasn't the one who wanted you gone. Please, come and join me for dinner. Okay. Let's go to Kwan Siu Ki. Is it all right if I have friends joining us? Just come. Okay. I'll practice with my band a bit more. I'll see you at 7:00, yeah? See you then, dear. -Done. -Yes! [shop bell chiming] [Parn] Who is that up at the front? [shopkeeper] Audrey Hepburn. So beautiful! How old is she now? [shopkeeper] She died a long time ago. Shame. I didn't get to take many photos of myself when I was young. Forget taking photos. I didn't even put on makeup. You must have been really pretty when you were young. [Parn sighs] I'm telling you, I almost got to be a singer. I'm told Kru Eua came to see me sing as well. But my parents found out. As you know, for people of our generation, it wasn't easy to become a singer. My younger days were spent raising my kid. But I think you still look good now. You've got a sweet mouth. Make sure you take a good photo. I want to have a beautiful photo for my funeral portrait. I'll make you look 50 years younger. [shop bell chiming] [cell phone ringing] Oh, hey! Wait for me! -[tires screech] -[car honks] Where the hell are you rushing to? Stop! Stop! Can't you stop here? Someone is calling you! If you won't pick up a passenger, what good are you? Where the hell were you rushing to? Going with the other bus? Open! Open! Open quickly! [Parn panting] Go! Go! Go! [groans] [man] Check that out! Go for it! Look here. Who is it? [exclaiming] Just my type! Wait a bit! Is this a human being or an angel? Will you call me if I give you my phone number, babe? -[man 2] I wouldn't if I was her! -Uh... [clears throat] Then give me your phone number. I'll call you, babe! [guffawing] See? She even gives me a seat. I have to take you up. Can we have a shot together, babe? I can tell my mom that I found her a daughter-in-law. Ready... One, two. How is it? Surprised at how handsome I am? Let's have one more shot to be sure. Is this me? Let's say it's our first photo together. -How old am I? -Say... Maybe 19? How old am I? -Twenty, maybe? -[gasps] [screams] How old am I? Uh, twenty. [gasps] [screams] [tires screech] What the hell? [mouthing] What's wrong? You're not eating. Thought you were hungry. Not sure what happened to my grandma. She's not picking up her phone. You're worried about her? I don't have any money. The kitchen is closing. Wanna order more? One more roast duck, please. Roast duck. [Bam] Shithead! I told you I don't have money. Why did you order more? Don't spoil my appetite. I'm buying time for your granny. What if she doesn't show up? I already knew you'd ask me that. That! We can pawn it for now and get it back when we have money. -[Big laughing] -Fuck you, Kae! Yeah? That's my guitar. [panting] [cell phone ringing] I'm on my way. Almost there. I'm now at... Come quickly, Grandma. I have no money. Why does your voice sound weird? [exclaiming] [squealing] [woman] Kid, the kitchen is closed. I'm just here for my grandson. [cell phone ringing] Hello? [cell phone ringing] [Big] What is it? That ringtone sounds like my granny's. -Come back again. -Where are you going? -You need a lift? -Need a lift? Where is the photo studio? What photo studio? Never heard of it. [gasps] What? There was a photo studio right here! I went here just a few minutes ago. Don't go in there! What bad luck! Get lost! [woman] Go away! [woman 2] Get lost! Do I look younger than you guys? [all screaming] [woman 3] You crazy bitch! Go away! [Bam wailing] -My guitar! How can I practice now? -[Kae speaking indistinctly] [cooing] Uncle Chian. How are you? Mom is missing. What? Ms. Parn is missing? Boom is the last one to have talked to her. She's gone missing. No one has seen her. Uh... Maybe she fell somewhere. -Or maybe it's something else-- -[Joy] No way! She's as strong as a beast. Or maybe someone kidnapped her for ransom. I think-- [Joy] No! Who would do that? With her face and outfit, people would think she comes from a poor family. Hey! You're not helping us here, so stop talking! What can we do now? Uh, I'm not sure yet. I don't know where she is. [ethereal music playing] Dad? -Forget it. -[music stops] Anything else? -Uh, if she calls you, please let me know. -Of course. Thank you. Wait! If you need ransom money, let me know. Okay? I'll sell this house for the money. Okay. Sell this house? Are you crazy? Where will I live then? I don't have a husband yet! So where's the bird? No idea. [man] Thank you all for coming to Khun Parn's funeral. I invite Mr. Suraphong, her son, to say something about her. Please. Mom is a good person. She died in a nursing home. -Cheers! -[all cheer] -Cheers! -[all cheer] -[cheers] -Cheers! [chanting] Cheers! She died in a nursing home. -[all cheering] -[festive music playing] [glass shatters] [gasps] [instructor] Lower your arms and breathe in. Breathe out. [exclaiming] [cheering] [show playing on TV] One hot tea. [laughing] [Parn] Being old is not easy. [teacup rattling] I used to be like them. That broccoli-looking hair style, I used to have it too. [gasps] The gods have given me a second chance with this youth, and I'm not letting it go to waste. [indistinct chatter] [exclaims] -This one? -Yeah. Okay, thank you. Give me the change. One baht. Oh, okay. [chuckling sheepishly] Thank you, beautiful. "Beautiful," my ass! [Joy] Wanna rent a room? It's 5,500 baht, electricity and water not included. Three months' rent in advance for deposit. You think I'm stupid? Your father set the price at 4,500, all included. You know my father? No, I just heard. So you want the room or not? I'll take it. But, 3,500 is enough. The room is small, and there hasn't been any tenant for years. You should thank me instead. Okay? Dad, she's our new tenant. What's your name? Pa... Parn. I'm going to my room now. Wait! Deposit in advance. [sighs] I'll give it to you later. What is it, Dad? A letter from Grandma. "I'm going away. Don't bother me." Where? Where? Where? [waltz music playing over speakers] Here you go. [chuckling] Who is that girl over there? [chuckles] My new tenant. What's she doing here? No idea. She said she's very close to her grandma, and she likes being with old people. [Lumyai] So weird!

I'm going to the toilet. You already know where the toilet is? Well, where is it? Go out and turn right. [police officer] I don't think your mother ran away from home. From this CCTV, you can see that person withdrawing the money from your mom's bank account. Oh, Ms. Parn. Do you have a better angle? We asked the bank already and will get it in a week. Oh! Why does it take so long? There are procedures, sir. Can't you make it any faster? Hey, I know a big name in this station. [police officer] Who? The chief officer. I'm the chief here. [chuckles awkwardly] So, Chief, what should I do next? Is there any other way, sir? We just need to wait for the footage. I'll contact you as soon as we get it. [sighs] [Nok] What do you think? You guys like it? It's super-delicious, Mom. It stinks. [chuckles nervously] I mean, it smells a bit fishy. When putting in the fish, you need to wait until the water boils. And don't stir the fish, or it'll get smelly. My granny taught me. [chuckles] Dad isn't home yet? Why? Yeah, why? Yeah, why? There he is. Oh, my dear.

Yeah, it would be nice to have emerging stars like you. Nice? It's more than nice! Brother, this is very fucking awesome, very peak motherfucker! -[Nut chuckles] -You're the man, man. So you're okay with this? We'll see you next week, then. Let's go. Is it good being on TV? Of course! That means you're talented! [squeals] [Parn fawning] Come here! I'm talented too. I don't think so. [all] Yeah! [humming] -[yelling] -[Parn screaming] [saucepan clangs] -[screaming continues] -[Chian grunting] Trying to hit a woman? What kind of person are you? [muffled speaking] Okay, I'll take off the tape, but don't make any sound. Got it? [whimpering] [exclaiming] You murderer! You murderer! -[exclaims] -[Chian groaning] -Watch it! You're not young anymore. -[Chian yelling] Enough with your fake identity! -What have you done to Ms. Parn? -Hmm? Did you kill her and throw her off the bridge? Huh? Fine. Kill me too. [crying] Without Parn, I don't want to live anymore. Oh, you've watched too many soap operas. You wouldn't understand... ...how good a person Ms. Parn is. When I was a kid... ...she was so good to me. I'll never forget her smile. Why the hell are you smiling? You can... Put your smiley face away! Go! Fine. I'll go away then. [sighs] [Young Parn] Let's play. [Young Parn giggling] [Young Parn giggling] Ms. Parn! [Chian] See? It looks so real. It is real. The other day, I went to eat barbecue, and I could even chew the bone. Must be so nice to be young again. [chuckling] I'll be on TV next week. You're going to be a TV star? No! I'm going to sing. You know, I always wanted to be a singer. Of course. I remember you going to singing competitions in the old days. [both chuckling] Do you remember the day when I sang after Lumyai? There was a music producer who saw me singing there. I'll definitely watch you on TV. By the way, Phong has been looking all over for you. Why now? He wanted me out of the house so badly. Mmm-mmm. Come on. He's really worried about you. Okay, I'll need your help. Don't act suspicious. [loudly] Why are they whispering? [Chian] You see, a few days ago, Ms. Parn came to see me. How is she? You see, she said she's just fine. No need to worry about her. Where is she now? Why isn't she coming home? You see, she said that she wanted to live a life of her own. Why do you keep saying, "you see"? You see... Come on! Why are you asking so many questions? Well, from what I saw, she looked very healthy, maybe even better than you two. What you mean by "healthier than you"? Uh, it's just... Did she say when she'll be back? Probably in a while. She said, once she lives her life, she'll stay with someone she loves. Love? Who? Mmm-hmm. You mean... ...she's going to kill herself? [Nok] Mom! [sobbing] No! It's me. You? Yeah. Uh, one more thing. It's important. She wants you to reactivate her credit card. I see. She probably needs some cash by now. Please tell her I'll take care of it. [Parn chuckling] What are you doing here? What? None of your business. -[Chian] Take care of yourself. -[Nok chuckling] [Lumyai] Your old man is up to something. What did you say? [Lumyai] Your dad is up to something! What do you mean? [high-tempo electronic music playing] [instructor chanting] With that brat, Parn. Why? She has some plan to get her hands on him. Why is that? He'll be dead soon anyway. [laughing] Exactly. He'll die soon. -[exclaims] -Chian! [chuckles nervously] She'll get everything. [chuckles] You should be careful. Otherwise, you'll have to call her "Mom." Who's your mommy? Who's your mommy? One, two, three, four! [chanting] [rusty metal creaking] [inaudible] What on Earth are you doing? Why did you ruin your nice bike? And don't you feel hot in that outfit? What are you laughing at? Get on! Aren't you in a hurry? Fine. -I gotta go now. -Hmm. Oh, what are you singing today? You'll find out soon. Don't worry. I'm gonna nail this. Yeah, just get inside. Be careful. Of course.

[music resumes] Hey, old man! -[gasps] -[screaming] Thank you. How was it? Hmm. Really great. I didn't think it would be this much fun. Look at the kids there. You sound like an old woman. [chuckling] When you're singing, you are like a totally different person. The audience really likes you. They really do. Did you know that a lot of people want to interview you? Interview? About what? Well, about you and your life. I'm also curious about you. We've been working together for a while, but I still don't know much about you. We can take it slowly. No need to rush. Right? What happened to your foot? [gasps] Let me see. No, it's okay. I have a first-aid kit in my bag. I'll be right back. Look! It really got wrinkled. This happened around the wound? I think so. When I was bleeding, it turned into this. Is it related? [Chian] I'm going in. [Parn] Wait! Do it softly. I'm scared. [Chian] Hold on. It's just a tiny prick. [wincing] -[screams] -[grunts] [Parn] Oh, look! It's bleeding and getting wrinkled. It's not what you think. Sleeping together? [Joy] Get out! [inaudible] [Chian] Stop! -[Joy yelling] -Have you lost your mind? -Get out! -[Chian grunting] Get out! Homewrecker! [Chian] Stop it! That is enough! [Joy] Go away! [Chian] Ms. Parn! Ms. Parn! -[Chian grunting] -[Joy yelling] [Chian] I said, enough! [Joy] Get out now! [Chian] Are you crazy? I said stop! Ms. Parn. [Boom] ♪ Happy birthday to you ♪ [all cheering] [cell phone ringing] [rain pattering] [Nut] Hello? Do you want a drink? Do you have any liquor? Liquor? Yeah. Is everything okay? You have any problems? No! Hmm. Your house is huge. Live alone? How do you clean this house? I have a maid. Why do you hire a maid? Why aren't you yet married? Who said I'm not married? You're married? No. [chuckles] Just kidding. I'm a little surprised, but it's good to see you here. Boyfriend? Hmm? Do you have a boyfriend? Right now, no. I used to have a husband, but he died a long time ago. We had one son. Now, there's a widower hitting on me. But he's only a friend. -We've known each other a long time. -[laughing] Are you playing with me? [chuckles] Okay, that means you don't have a boyfriend now. What kind of guys do you like? I like someone who is kind, who takes care of his family, a hard worker, and good in bed too! Sorry, sorry. [gasps] No, I didn't mean-- -You, pervert! -No! -You pervert! -[punches thudding] Phong! Hello, Uncle Chian. What are you doing here? Well... What is it? It may sound difficult to understand, but it's the truth. Yes. If you have anything to tell me, just say it. Actually, Ms. Parn didn't go missing. The young Parn, she is Ms. Parn. I'm sorry. You mean that young singer is my mom? Told you it'd be difficult to understand. Quite so. But I think I understand you. I should have told you earlier. Can you save this contact info? Really? That's good. This friend of mine, he is a specialist in Alzheimer's. I'm sure he can help you. 081-162... [rock music playing] ♪ So handsome ♪ ♪ So handsome ♪ ♪ Looking at your beautiful eyes ♪ [Nut] What song are they playing? "Uh Hur, Lor Jang," Huai Khwang version. They're going to sing this song at the concert. No way. Stop there. I don't think we can use this song for the concert. I'll find someone to write you a new song. [Boy] Let me call him now. -[Nut] I think it should be okay. -[Boy] Okay. Nut. What's wrong with this song? It's focusing too much on Parn. What is your band's real identity? We do have our "Huai Khwang Keang" song. You want to listen to it? That song? You think that's good enough? To be honest, without Parn, your band is nothing. Boom. Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Listen to me. Don't act like this. Please stop! Leave me alone! [Parn] Stop! Stop, Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom! Why are you doing this? Don't bother me! Just make a new song with that asshole! I'm done here! Calm down. He only wished the best for us. Us? Yeah. Maybe only for you. It's not like that. Like what? You slept with him, didn't you? How could you say that? Who taught you to say things like that? You're just a kid. How come you're so disrespectful? Apologize now! Leave me alone! I suck! You keep looking down on yourself. Don't you know how great you are? You have a chance to do the thing you love. Are you gonna just let it go like this? Boom! Boom! [door opens] Can I come in? [pats] [sighs] What's wrong? You wouldn't understand. I might understand when I hear it. I think I'm gonna stop playing music. I suck. And someone said my song sucked too. [Phong] Hmm... Does anyone like it? A few people. But you're quitting because one person doesn't like it? Don't you love what you do? If you love something, don't give it up so easily. If Grandma were here, she would say the same thing. [chuckles] You think she misses us? I'd like to hear your song. You want me to play? Yeah, I wanna hear it. [clears throat] Are you sure? Whoo! Three, four. [singing off-key] For the people of Huai Khwang There must be obstacles Screw you! For the people of Huai Khwang There must be obstacles Screw you! Screw you! Screw you! Screw you! Whoo! Whoo! [Nut] Have you seen Boom? No. It's a shame. I think he's such a talented kid, but he has a temper. Still young and doesn't want to listen to others. Just give him some time. I'm sure he'll come back. Okay. Aside from the band, I have something to ask you. Yes? Do you think it's possible for us to get to know each other more? Oh. Are you hitting on me? Yes, I am. I understand. No, it's not like that. I need some time to think. Okay, I'll wait, then. This is for you. Thank you. Hey! If you became young again, what would you do? I'd probably do something I never got to do back then. Date every woman and do whatever makes me happy. We've spent a lifetime already, and what we have now is just a bonus. In fact, being old is not so bad. I kind of miss fighting with Lumyai. Speaking of her, I haven't seen her lately. Has she gone to the US? Here, I got you an Americano. She didn't get to go after all. Life is full of uncertainties. -[tires squeal] -[horn honks] [rock music playing] All right! It's the moment you've all been waiting for. The band that used to play on the streets is now playing here on stage. Huai Khwang![all chanting] Huai Khwang! Huai Khwang! I know them well, especially the lead singer. See? We're so close. Let's give them some time to prepare before we meet Huai Khwang. Uh, hey, Kae. What? I think Boom's changed. Why? Think of our new song. It's totally different from our previous songs. You think too much. Just let him change the style if he wants. Yeah, maybe the new style is good. Maybe I'll ask him to play acoustic music. Acoustic? It only requires two guitars. What about me? Just sit and listen. I have something for you to listen to. [soft acoustic music playing] [inaudible] He said he composed this because of you. What else did he say? Can I borrow some money? [chuckles] I need to get my guitar back. What a kid! The concert is about to start. Let's go. Oh, where's Boom? He's gone to get his guitar back. When will he be back? Thirty minutes? I don't know. Call him now! [cell phone ringing] Hello? Yeah, on my way. See you soon! Whoo! -[bicycle bell rings] -Whoo-hoo! See you inside. Wait. I have something for you. I thought about giving it to you after the concert, but it's better to give it now. Let me help you. Thank you. Boom should be inside. Okay. [chuckles] About what you asked me before, I have an answer. But I wanna tell you after the concert. [chuckles] Whoo! [tires screech] [siren blaring] -In a coma? -[mouthing] We should cancel it now. [orderly] Make way! Coming through! No! We have to play this song. We gave everything we had for this day. When Boom wakes up, we can let him know how great his song was and how much the audience loved it. [heart monitor beeping] [chanting] Huai Khwang! Huai Khwang! Huai Khwang!

Just go and live the life you always wanted. Please don't do anything for this ungrateful son. Boom is my son. I'll do everything to cure him. Just go, Mom! Where do you want me to go? Why do you always ask me to leave? Even if I die today and am born again... ...I'll still do the same thing... ...because what I want to do the most... ...is be your mom... ...and Boom's granny.

Maybe because... ...I'm a human being... ...a normal person... ...a woman... ...a mother... ...a grandma... ...a weak person... ...and a coward... ...too scared to see anyone die. ♪ Jumping up so high To cross the wall... ♪ [Parn] Wow, that is great!
