[tense music playing] - [phone dings] - [woman] Oh my God. Oh my God. [radio sounds] Oh my God. [in Dari] Wait, wait. [in English] They are here. [exhales] [journalist] There's now more urgency than ever to get those in danger out of Afghanistan amid reports that the Taliban are now going door-to-door in an attempt to find people on their blacklist. [music intensifies] - [shouting] - [child cries] [in Dari] Dear God! [shouting] [in Pashto] Bashir! I won't leave you here. I won't leave. I won't go anywhere without you. Either we go together or we won't go at all. [helicopter whirrs] [ominous music playing] [journalist in English] It's cost two trillion dollars and many thousands of lives, but America's longest war may finally be nearing an end. Twenty years have passed since a US-led invasion ended the Taliban's brutal rule in Afghanistan. Now the Taliban and the US are negotiating in Qatar. [whistling and drumming] [Bashir in Pashto] The mayor of Maidan Wardak, Zarifa Ghafari, is here to speak. For 50 years, war has been imposed on Afghans. We don't want any more war. Stand beside your sisters. Let them be educated so that both men and women can rebuild the country together. Young people, you must work for it. Study and work. Compete with your peers. [tense music playing] Drop the weapon and take up a pen. This country will be built by the pen and by education. - We want security! - We want it! - We want education! - We want it! - [Zarifa] We want peace! - We want peace! - We want peace! - We want peace! - We want security! - We want security! - We want security! - We want security! - We want peace! - We want peace! [hopeful music playing] [Zarifa] Let's all work together. Both men and women, be courageous and stand together. If we work hard and try our best, we can build this country ourselves. Long live Afghanistan! Long live Afghanistan! [cheering and whistling] [car horn honks] [siren blares] [car horns honk in distance] [Zarifa in Dari] I applied to be the mayor of Maidan Wardak. And from the first day I applied for the position, I encountered problems. For nine months, people tried to prevent my appointment. But I did not give up. Men have had their chance here for the last 40 or 50 years. What have they achieved? Nothing. [traffic sounds] [man in Pashto] There are no female mayors in other provinces. Why in Maidan? A woman! Aren't there enough men? Our men are as strong as trees. She should stay at home, cook and do housework. Look after the kids. Not boss us around like this. [laughs] [market chatter] Please sign it, so I can take it to the governor's office. Put the chair there. Welcome. How are you? Good morning, everyone. I hope you are all okay. I'm glad to see so many of you present. This is the only office working like this out of all the others in the province. I want to fight for women's education rights here. And I will work for this. And I won't be leaving here until you are all totally sick of me. Signed. [car engines sound] [ominous music playing] [journalist in Dari] The US and Taliban have recently completed their latest round of peace negotiations with the aim of ending the war in Afghanistan and signing an agreement for permanent peace. [in English] The Taliban wants to make a deal. We'll see if they wanna make a deal. It's got to be a real deal, but we'll see. [in Dari] God damn this situation. Damn it! [music intensifies] In the name of Allah. May God protect us. [car horns honk] [Massoum] I am Mayor Zarifa Ghafari's driver, and I guard her 24/7. And I'm very happy to be serving a woman who so completely serves her country and her people. [tyres screech] After we pass these deserts, we'll feel safer. Slow down. Drive slowly. Cars are heading towards us. [car horns honk] [Massoum in Pashto] I drive above the speed limit, one hand on the steering wheel, one on my pistol, because the road I drive Zarifa on every day between Kabul and Maidan Shar is controlled by the Taliban. [in Dari] She is a champion for me and our people. I live every second of my life with the memory of her. [alarm sounds in distance] [Zarifa] This is a letter I received from the Taliban that says, [in Pashto] "Miss Zarifa Ghafari, As-Salaam-Alaikum." "You're continuing to do pagan works in spite of our warnings, and in the name of democracy you are spreading vice in our society." "For the last time, we order you to leave Maidan Wardak in a week." "Refusing to do so will result in your assassination." [in Dari] But I haven't left Maidan Wardak yet. Hm. This was sent in November 2017. Now it's 2020 and I'm still working. I'm still alive, and, God willing, it will stay that way. [dogs barking and traffic in distance] Walk around, my little baby. Go on. Hurry up! [makes playful sounds] [in Pashto] Hurry up! You can do it. [makes playful sounds] [Massoum] When I first met Zarifa, I really wanted to help her. I considered her my sister, from the bottom of my heart. [ominous music playing] Zarifa is fighting for freedom of speech in her country. For women's rights, for human rights. But within the Islamic framework. - [Zarifa] How long have you been here? - [woman] Since last night. What should I do, my dear? Don't cry. Don't cry. Don't cry. [car horns honk in distance] Take this, please. Bless you! [Massoum] Her enemies say that what she is doing is blasphemous. [car horns honking] [ominous music gets louder] [in Dari] We have been living here for five years. In five years, not a single government vehicle has come into this area. They haven't crossed the main road to get here. We decide everything here. Any fighting or killing is punished by us. The government doesn't exist here. As-Salaam-Alaikum. [in Pashto] All good? [chatter] [Musafer in Dari] The government has failed the people of Afghanistan. Ask the people here whether the government has done anything for them. We are from this country and we will serve it. [tense music playing] [Talib speaker] Brave mujahideen! Until we establish Islamic rule across the whole planet, we will not surrender to anyone. I have been put here to fight people. I have been instructed to kill people. To destroy people, behead people. Until they believe there is no god but Allah. Ah. [Musafer] I have been fighting in these mountains since the US invasion in 2001. Look at me, I am 36 years old, but everyone thinks I am 40 or 50 years old. [dramatic music playing] We are fighting for pure Sharia law in this country. If you cut off one hand, others will refrain from stealing. If you crush one person under a wall, no one will commit homosexuality. If one person is stoned, no one will commit fornication. This is the righteous way, which will lead us forward. [Zarifa] I remember, when I was a child during the Taliban rule, one day the Taliban took a woman to Chaman Hozori stadium. They made her wear a blue burka. A man stood next to her and shot her in the head with a Kalashnikov. I witnessed this when I was just a kid. [gunshot sounds] [dramatic music intensifies] We will witness these horrors again. The horror of the Taliban. The fear of the Taliban. [man] See how we stop our enemies in Afghanistan. We pack the car with explosives and park it in the desert. - Then they come to see whose car it is. - [explosion sounds] Then the car explodes. Did it become unsafe like it has been in the last 40 years because a woman like Zarifa Ghafari walks freely around the province? Her husband should accompany her. There should not be vice in this country. God tells us to kill them without hesitation. We're getting closer to the checkpoint. That side is the government. That's the city. This doesn't work there. If we have this, they will arrest us. They will say the Taliban have entered the city. And now they will say, "No Taliban." [in Pashto] Hello. How are you? Where are you coming from? [Massoum] We have to move from this flat as soon as possible. - It's an emergency. It's out of control. - What do you mean? We're being followed. I'm being followed because of you. We are all being followed. - [Zarifa] Hm. - [Massoum] I have to be extra careful. [Zarifa] Why didn't you inform me earlier? Because I didn't want you to be afraid. It's bad. We have to move before they kill us. [Zarifa] Pick it up from the bottom, Bashir. One of you hold it from the top. - Should we do it now or later? - No. No. Let's put it on top. Look at what she has! [laughs] Mister, take this and put it over there. Don't ruin it. One minute! [Massoum] The carpets are washed, be careful. Hurry up. [in Dari] Sometimes it is difficult. When you realise someone is going to hurt you, someone is following you or trying to make trouble for you. It is very tough. But this is life in Afghanistan. You just have to accept it. Women like me, we like to have self-confidence. In Afghanistan, if a woman doesn't know how to drive, especially now, it must mean her hands and legs are broken! [car horns honking] [in Pashto] Don't put more weight. Did you carry all of that upstairs? No, don't do that. No, come on. Okay, give it to me. Bring it here. - Give it to me. - No, it's very heavy. [traffic sounds in distance] [Bashir] Kabul has been rebuilt so beautifully. It looks awesome. Show it to him. [laughs] Let him also see Kabul. Look! Oh. Look at how beautiful Kabul is. [whistling sounds] [Bashir and Zarifa in Dari] ♪ My homeland My pride is my love for you ♪ ♪ My homeland I will sacrifice myself for you ♪ ♪ Homeland, wherever I will be ♪ ♪ You will give me soul and spirit ♪ - We came from this way, right? - Yes, we did. Wow, what a car you have! Nice to meet you. Oh, yes... What is your name? Mohammad? - Is your name Mohammad? - [boy] Yes. - Is she his sister? - Yes. They also have a younger brother, younger than them. - She can't see anything? - No, nothing at all. [Musafer] God bless you, sir, for your hard work. [teacher] Please recite a verse by heart. I seek refuge in Allah from the outcast Shaitan in the name of Allah the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful... [Zarifa] The Taliban doesn't want the people of Afghanistan, and particularly Afghan women, to become educated. [girl continues reciting prayer] [Zarifa] Because education is against all those things they believe. [ominous music playing] Because educated people ask questions, and they are afraid of questions. Whenever I meet people from different communities, I ask them to educate their children because education is the only way out of this situation in Afghanistan. [in Pashto] Hello, how are you? Are you well? - We thank you for coming here. - [animals murmur] Thank you. Our girls do study. There... There are some classes. As a girl, I studied. I have a bachelor's and a master's degree. When I was studying, I had to walk an hour each way to my school in Paktika. There were many suicide attacks and fights. My father told me not to go anymore. So I started going to school secretly. I was going to school in secret after he went to the office. It was my lifetime dream to see that my parents are proud of my reputation and my achievements. So please educate your daughters and send them to school. If you educate one girl or woman, you save ten generations. [hopeful music playing] [teacher in English] Who wants to give me an example? In the name of Allah, do you have potato chips? [teacher] "Exclamatory" means "surprise." You surprise someone. [Zarifa in Dari] Education is the key to a country's development. This is the battle between ignorance and knowledge. The battle between light and dark. You know, Mum, I swear, sometimes I don't want to get out of bed, but I get up and get on with it because I have to. Oh, yes. In this country, anyone who works with honesty is soon murdered. Unfortunately, that's how it is. May God protect you. You must take care of yourself. [sombre music playing] [Zarifa] My dad is a military officer who thinks the home is a military base. He gives the orders, and we're part of his battalion. I had to make my father believe that I was capable. I always had to fight against my dad's behaviour and mindset, even about me going to university. At least I changed my father's mindset. I think that is the biggest achievement of my life. My flight is from here to Dubai, Dubai to France, and from France to the US, Washington, DC. [Bashir in Pashto] Me and the whole nation are so proud of you. [journalist in Dari] The US has signed a peace deal with the Taliban. President Trump has said that US troops will leave Afghanistan entirely if the Taliban cease their violence towards US forces. [Zarifa in Pashto] Bashir, the only thing that is a bit positive in this agreement is that if either party violates the agreement, then it will be terminated. Do a campaign there. Have faith in God. Your voice is powerful. Your words and messages must be heard. You must not cry, or I won't go. No, no. Go. [plane sounds] [woman in English] Our office is so proud to work with our colleagues from across the world to select a remarkable group of women who exemplify exceptional courage and leadership in advocating for human rights, women's equality and social progress, often at great personal risk. [journalist in Dari] Zarifa Ghafari, the first woman mayor, along with ten other women from different parts of the world, was selected for the Women of Courage award by the department of foreign affairs of the United States. [in English] My name is Zarifa Ghafari. Actually I'm not a hero. I'm just the mayor of Maidan Shar. Women of my generation have not forgotten the reign of the Taliban, and we are worried for the future. Let me ask for your continued support to ensure that the Afghan peace process does not erase the gains that have been made since the dark days of the Taliban regime. [in Dari] That this bravery award was received, at a global level, by Zarifa Ghafari, mayor of Maidan Wardak, represents a fundamental change in our political system. [Zarifa in Pashto] Hi, dear Bashir. The president said my name at the parliament inauguration ceremony! He said that I was a brave woman! And that I have made the whole nation proud! [screams excitedly] [laughs] [in English] Love you! Love you! [in Pashto] Wow! Wow! Wow! I am so, so, so proud. You're the pride of the nation and that's enough. You won't die unless we are dead. First, I will die and then you. Then, we both will enter paradise and live there forever, okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. [laughs] [Zarifa in Dari] My fiancé Bashir... My dear Bashir... Bashir is why I smile. [ethereal music playing] [laughs] When he realised that I had found my mission in life, he stood beside me, and he has encouraged me in all my work. He has applauded, enjoyed, and celebrated. - This one is beautiful. - Mm. These are childish. I don't like them at all, none of them. This is all of them. This one. Who expected this would happen so soon? [tailor] Please get closer. [Zarifa in English] I am here to select my wedding dress. It's amazing for me. [sighs] [laughs] [mimics animal noise] [Zarifa in Dari] I am perhaps the luckiest Afghan woman to have a partner like him. Look at my little baby. Why? What do you mean, Dad? What do you mean? So I will just get a house for myself, Dad. Okay. Thank you. [in English] You know, I am dealing with shits around. Seriously. [in Dari] I'm not a kid. He's of that old mindset that the groom shouldn't come to my house until we are married. The tradition is to accompany the bride to her house, party there for a bit and then leave. Isn't it? Now my dad is saying that he doesn't want this. What do you really want, Dad? Just tell me. [Zafira's father] There's no reason. Just do what I told you to. No, Dad. This is my life, for God's sake. What's the reason? What do you want? [Zafira's father] Unless you are married, he shouldn't come to my house. That's all! What do you mean? Are you kicking me out of the house? Are you kicking me out of the house? Is it your house? You know, life is much harder than anyone can imagine. Especially the life of a girl who wants to have everything. Who wants to do everything by herself. She is stopped from the moment she leaves home until she gets to a position of power. It's difficult. I live in a society where I even have to fight against my dad's thoughts. I even have to make my dad understand that I am a human. [cries] - [animals murmur] - [engines sound] [ominous music playing] [chatter] - [people shouting] - [horses neighing] [whistling and cheering] [journalist] Today, Zarifa Ghafari, the mayor of Maidan Wardak, survived an attack. She said that on her way home from Maidan Wardak, a car opened fire at her in the Khushal Khan area of Kabul. [in Pashto] My fiancé was with me and was driving. They opened fire on us before we were able to fire our gun back. [journalist in Dari] This is just one of many attacks in recent weeks. The Taliban have been targeting government officials in the capital in an effort to show the people that the government has lost control. [cars honking] [people shouting] [doorbell rings] [in Pashto] Who's that? [unlocks door] - Come on in. How are you? - Greetings. How are you? [Zarifa] I have to tell you something important. The Haqqani network wants to harm us. Initially, I didn't take it seriously, but since receiving this call, I know it's serious. Uh... They said they would share it with other departments too. But it's important that you take some measures yourself. May God protect us. We should be extra careful. [sombre music plays] - [people chattering] - [alarm sounds] [siren blares] [journalist in Dari] Abdul Wasi Ghafari, the father of Zarifa Ghafari, the mayor of Maidan Wardak province, and a strike force commander at the Ministry of Defence, was assassinated yesterday by gunmen outside his house in Kabul. [sombre music intensifies] Let the funeral car pass. [screaming and crying] [Zarifa] Uncle! Can I see him once more, please? - [Zarifa's cousin] She's already seen him. - I want to see him one last time. [Zarifa's uncle] Okay, go in from that side. Wait. From this side. Rest in peace. We are here. We'll take care of everything. You're a martyr, a hero! We'll take care of it, Dad! [Zarifa's uncle] Come on, hop off. Come on, my dear! People are waiting. Come on, dear, everything is waiting out there and you know it, my dear. [sombre music continues] [crying] [Zarifa] The Taliban claimed responsibility for it. I feel guilty about what happened to my father and family. If it wasn't for me, my father would be alive now. Sometimes I regret having had bad thoughts about him. I miss him so much. [siren blaring in distance] [Karima] Last night, while laying down... I was thinking, it's hard to believe my husband has died. And about how easily he left us. He was a healthy person, who left home full of hope. And they brutally killed him. You lose him so easily that you ask yourself, "Where did he go?" As if it was a nightmare. [child screams excitedly] [Karima] Noman wrote something. Should they go another round? [Karima] He wrote two letters at school, one for me and one for his dad. He wrote, "Dear Dad, thank you for being with me until I was nine years old." "But you left us so soon." He wrote one to me. "I'm grateful that you're still alive." [sombre music playing] While reading it, I thought... that a kid at his age should be playing in a playground. But all he wanted was for his mum to be alive. Jump! Come, go on. Ah. Hey, Mum, do this, without thinking or crying. [Karima] It's this pain that we Afghan women have been enduring. And every second, we're just waiting for what's next. War, war, war until now. Many countries came here saying they would help us. Where's your help? We're still grieving. We're still suffering. So why did you come in the first place? And now that you're leaving, what did you achieve? [camera shutter clicks] [celebratory music plays] [army speaker] Please cheer for the champions of this nation! [Zarifa] I am proud to be the daughter of a military officer who served for 37 years. I'm the daughter of someone who was one of you. Cowardly, despicable, and shameless enemies martyred my father. [in Pashto] They are brutal cowards. If he had died fighting, I wouldn't be sad. But they killed my father right in front my little brother. It was cowardly. They killed him in front of our house. They shot him in the back of the head. When my father was martyred, everyone said, "Zarifa will leave her job in Maidan Wardak and escape." But my mother told me to keep up my struggle [sombre music playing] and to continue as long as I can speak. [reciting the Quran] [in Dari] Take a deep breath, focus... [in English] Fire. [in Dari] ...and pull the trigger. [Biden in English] I'm now the fourth United States president to preside over American troop presence in Afghanistan. I will not pass this responsibility on to a fifth. US troops will be out of Afghanistan before we mark the 20th anniversary of that heinous attack on September 11th. It's time for American troops to come home. [explosions sound in distance] [Zarifa in Dari] Here we go. Both sides are exchanging "gifts." Since morning. It's been like this for a week now. The situation is bad. The army went to retake the other district. - Jaghato? - It's recaptured. [gunshots sound] [journalist] As the Taliban react to the news of imminent US troop withdrawal, violence is continuing across the country. [Massoum] A lot has changed in the last year. There's more insecurity, mafia, theft. So a lot has changed. War swallows the helpless and poor. If you join the government, the Taliban kills you. If you join the Taliban, the government kills you. Whatever your circumstances, life here is very difficult. [journalist] Some of the Afghan forces were surrounded in Raghistan district. These soldiers have told the media that they lack food and equipment. The Taliban are trying to cut off connections with the big cities. [sombre music playing] [Zarifa] The provinces are falling one by one. The Taliban claim that 80% of the country is under their control. [Massoum in Pashto] Politicians begged for money from the world, and put it in their own pockets. And people are upset with the government because of this, and so they are supporting the Taliban. [Musafer in Dari] The international community says they brought money to help Afghanistan. Where in Afghanistan did they help? [animals murmur] They lied to the people of Afghanistan by saying they'd help us. We haven't seen any of their support. Look around here. There are no bridges, no road, no clinic, no doctor, and no school. We will build this country ourselves. [in Pashto] Get those 20 people ready over here. You are the new recruits for this new unit. [in Dari] Where is his coat? Give him his coat. [in Pashto] Give him his coat. - Have they brought towels? - No, they haven't. All right, just put on your headscarf. You've got a big head. It doesn't fit. You tied it upside down. [in Dari] They sewed it wrong. [in Pashto] They made it like this. You have all witnessed the occupiers come to Afghanistan. The occupiers have looted Afghanistan. They looted the whole of Afghanistan. They destroyed people's houses. [Massoum] I am from a small village in the countryside, just like most of the Taliban. Talib is my brother, Talib is my cousin. The Taliban are from the same blood as me. The way they have chosen, I don't agree with it. Taliban are Afghans, just misled Afghans. [in Dari] Hey, let's play football. Come here, boys! Come on. Come on, come on. The government area has kidnappings and robberies. Come on. Our territory is 100% safe. You can travel anywhere, day and night. You deserve a yellow card! [sombre music playing] In Afghanistan, you have to pick up the gun. A voice alone does nothing. [cheering] [siren blares] [car horns honk] [Zarifa] What's going on? [Massoum] It's a car accident. [Zarifa] Is it a car accident or are they fighting? No, move forward. I'll park there. I'll see what's going on. [in Pashto] It's a protest. [Zarifa in Dari] I'm fine. Thanks, Commander. How are you? Thank you. [army commander] There's a protest happening on the Kabul-Maidan road. Last night, three civilians were killed in a military operation by the 001 unit. Okay. [shouting] [man in Pashto] He was just a labourer, nothing more than that. He was a tractor driver. Why did they kill him? They shot him dead last night. It's not fair! Clear the way! This innocent person has been killed. We don't want the puppets of America! That pimp! Long live the mujahideen (Taliban). [Zarifa] The route is shut because of a mission. There is fighting going on in Kunj. [Bashir] Stay in the car. Let's see what happens. Trust in God. [car horns honking in distance] [in Dari] The rice is yours. [laughs] - Is it rice? - No, beans. [laughing] [Zarifa] Are there Taliban inside Mazar? [Zarifa's sister] In one or two provinces, where the Taliban are in control, I heard that they are forcing the young girls and women to get married to them. Worst-case scenario, if I have to, I will marry a Talib, and then I'll become a Talib and kill him. I know what I am going to do. - We live on the 6th floor right? - Yes. One of the lifts has a net, but the other one doesn't. We'll open it. I'll jump first, then her, and then she can jump on me because she doesn't want to die, but we would. She'll fall on top of us so she doesn't feel any pain. I'll die first and then others. Otherwise, we'll have to hide our phones, wear burkas and sit in our houses. Isn't it better to marry a Talib than throw yourself from the building? No, the lift shaft is better. [laughs] [ominous music playing] [Zarifa] The Taliban were lashing a woman just because she had no male companion outside. I don't know where humanity, logic, or Islam instructs it. What's going to happen after the withdrawal? [sirens blare] [journalist in English] An explosion rocked a school in Kabul today. That's the price girls pay just for going to school in Afghanistan. Islamic extremists are against education for girls. As international forces pull out, the extremists are killing those who want to learn. [Zarifa in Dari] Hello, good morning. Excuse me, Doctor. Look who came. The mayor of Maidan Wardak came a long way to meet you. She wants to see how you feel. Be strong. Dear, my dear. Alaikum-Salaam, my dearest sister. - Are you okay? - [student] Yes, thanks. Where were you when the attack happened? [student] We'd just been let out of school. We took two steps forward, then it exploded. I was horrified and scared. I didn't know if I was dead or alive. I was just hoping my mother wouldn't be terrified and I could go home. - What year are you in? - Upper sixth. Upper sixth? So when you've finished school, I'll see you in university, okay? We Afghans don't stop at one or two people. They killed dozens of kids. If a lion hunts, it kills and eats just one. It does not hunt the whole family. I don't want my family to pay for my choices anymore. These books are mine. [in Pashto] Saliheen, I will tell you. Put it there. Hello, brothers, how are you? I am being transferred to Kabul for a new job. I wanted to say goodbye to you all before I left. If I ever offended anyone, please forgive me. I wish you all the very best of luck. [calm music playing] Thank you very much. [popper pops] Thank you very much. Keep well! Thank you very much, dear Haji Saib. You can go. I will follow. [phone rings] [Massoum] She got a new job at the Ministry of Defence, but she won't take me with her. [in Dari] Why did I lose my job? Did I have any flaws? Didn't I help her in her hour of need? Wasn't I ready to devote myself for her? On the contrary... I shielded her from bullets when we were ambushed. [in Pashto] But now I have been left behind. [in Dari] I sacrificed myself for her and made myself an enemy of the whole Islamic Emirate (Taliban). That was my biggest sacrifice for her. [sombre music playing] [sighs] [Zarifa] I got a new job at the Ministry of Defence. Go downstairs. I will come. I tried to keep Massoum as my driver, but the ministry had strict rules and it did not allow me to have a driver who wasn't in the military. [traffic sounds] Unfortunately, Massoum thinks that I betrayed him. When you see that the world betrays you, you see everyone as a traitor, and you think everyone betrayed you. I'm head of the department for the martyred and disabled. That's my car and I hold an ID card. I'm looking for the families of soldiers. I'm listing their names. The Ministry of Defence will help them. - Father's name? - [woman] Mohammadullah. - [in Pashto] What? - [woman] Mohammadullah. - Mohammad... - [woman] Mohammadullah. Where was your son stationed? Do you have documents? [in Dari] I'm looking for the families of soldiers. We're trying to help you. [woman] All we need is shelter. Were any of your family members in the national army? [man] No, sister. Hello, sir. Was your son in the national army? No. [Zarifa] We're searching for the families of the national army. Your father's name is Mohammad Noor? My husband's in the army. His brothers were martyred. [man] Excuse me, sister, what list are you writing? [Zarifa in Pashto] Bashir, take this one. [woman in Dari] Two family members were murdered. [Bashir] The ones responsible for police will come tomorrow. I can't register families of the police. Can you hear? I cannot do anything! [sombre music playing] What do I do, my dear? Please, do something. Tell me, what am I meant to do, my dear? That's up to you. I'm so underprivileged. My son is mentally ill. One of my sons went missing. My husband was killed in the fighting. I will leave. God bless you. God bless your father. [journalist] The Taliban took control of many districts today. That means they control most of the country except the largest cities. [Massoum in Pashto] I am unemployed now. [sighs] There are thousands of young people like me, burning in this hell. [in Dari] The biggest disaster is disappointment. [sombre music playing] [journalist 1 in English] US forces have left their main military base in Afghanistan, the hub for a 20-year mission against the Taliban and Al-Qaeda, as US involvement fighting terrorists in the country is coming to an end. [journalist 2] Most NATO forces have quietly left ahead of the American president's promise they'd be gone by September 11th. [journalist 3] Meanwhile, fighting continues in the city of Kandahar, the country's second-largest city. This has left the Afghan capital of Kabul increasingly isolated from the rest of the country. With security rapidly deteriorating, Washington is urging Americans to leave immediately. [journalist 4] The Taliban are on the brink of capturing the city of Lashkar Gah. [journalist 5] The Taliban are rapidly advancing towards the Afghan capital, Kabul. Another strategically important provincial... [journalist 6] The Taliban has just taken two provincial capitals in just two days. [journalist 7] The speed of their advance has surprised almost everyone. [journalist 8] Now it feels it is inevitable that the capital city is going to fall. [Zarifa] Oh my God. Oh my God. Oh my God. [in Dari] Wait, wait. [dramatic music playing] [in English] They are here. [journalist] Afghanistan's president, Ashraf Ghani, has gone. He has left the country. He escaped as Taliban leaders push for what they claim is a peaceful transfer of power here in Kabul. [journalist 2] Twenty years after the West declared war on the Taliban, they are back in control of Afghanistan. Taliban fighters entered the Afghan capital this morning. [UN official] I'm very worried about what's happening. Have you been in touch with the US embassy? [Zarifa] If you can please recommend me and my family and my husband to anywhere, especially to the US Embassy, I'll be happy. Thank you. [phone beeps] [dramatic music intensifies] [car horns honking] [in Dari] I don't know why we have been sentenced to this. I know I won't survive if I stay. I don't want to leave. I don't have an alternative. - [shouting] - [helicopters whirring] [child cries] [journalist in English] Helicopters are filling the air over Kabul as diplomats and foreigners try to escape Afghanistan. Around the airport, the people wait. This wasn't how it was supposed to end. [in Dari] They are leaving. - [Zarifa] Where are they going? - [Bashir] Kabul is being evacuated. - [in English] Big one. The big one. - [sighs] [Zarifa in Pashto] We'll only leave if we can get out together. Or we don't go. I built this home with so much hope. I was so hopeful for life. [Bashir] It's okay. God is kind. [sombre music playing] We can't keep you here. [Zarifa] Bashir, I will not leave you here. I won't leave. I won't go anywhere without you. Either we go together or we won't go at all. [helicopter whirring] [in English] Hey, guys. I'm in. I'm in with all of my family members. [in Dari] I'm leaving everything, Mum. This is utter cowardice. [engines sound] [door opens] [door shuts] [in English] I have a small amount of sand of my country. I have it with me, you know? It's been a few nights. I'm far away. And I'm not able to sleep without touching it. I need to have it at my hand. It's really hard. They took everything away, you know? I had everything. I had everything and now I have nothing than a small amount of sand in my hand. [dog barking] [whistles] [in Pashto] Sometimes I celebrate and laugh, my friend. Sometimes I am sad and cry, my friend. Sometimes, I fly like a bird. Sometimes, I am the salt rubbed into your wounds. [car horns honking] The sudden regime change is strange. No one could have imagined it. Will Afghanistan see another invasion? Will we return to war? Will we be bombed again? Will they put me in prison in the name of the Taliban or as a terrorist? It is not clear. The future is now totally uncertain. - [dogs barking] - [car horns honking] [baby cries] [laughs] [squeaks] I am happy because I am still beside my daughter, who is my whole life. I will do anything to protect her. [sombre music playing] [chanting on TV] [protesters in Dari] Freedom, freedom! Is our basic right! [journalist] Today women protesters took to the streets of Kabul, saying the Taliban were oppressing women's freedoms. [protesters] The Taliban government is not legitimate without women's rights. [shouting] Seeing this, I have two feelings. First, that these women are very strong and I am proud of them. Second, that I am sad not to be among them. [journalist 1 in English] The World Food Programme warned today Afghanistan is facing a catastrophe of hunger. Its economy has collapsed. International finance organisations froze Afghan assets after the Taliban takeover of Kabul. [journalist 2 in Dari] Sanctions on the Taliban have meant food prices have increased throughout Afghanistan. Many NGOs and businesses left at the same time as the foreign forces, so homelessness, poverty, and unemployment are on the rise. [chattering] Listen to what I am saying. I do not have the resources. When I find the resources... You listen to what I say. Poverty is at its peak. Please, do not bother me anymore. I do not have the capability. I am helpless. [woman] Call Sadia. I am Sadia. [car horns honking] This is Simia. Look at what these poor and needy people are going through. All of them are in need of a single loaf of bread. Why? What was the reason? Who committed treason in this country? [woman] May God damn them! [sombre music playing [Massoum in Pashto] Here, we are living in the dirt. Some of the jobless have become addicts. [dog barks] Aren't poor people human beings? Don't they also have hearts and needs? Oh! No, no, no, no... [yells] ♪ Our city is full of the poor ♪ ♪ It does not deserve bombing ♪ I worked with someone who went on the world stage and called the Taliban a dark government. I don't know what they think of me. I don't know what the future holds. Life or death, only God knows. - [music playing] - How are you? All well? You don't have any guns, right? Move. [Massoum] You know what's good about it? THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD It's the freedom. After taking the car from Maidan, there wasn't a police checkpoint to stop me. In the previous regime, I was a driver for Zarifa. Zarifa was a mayor here? Yeah, she was a nasty woman! - He is a mujahid? - I was a mujahid then as well. Yeah, right! Not a mujahid, a woman's driver! I was a driver for the municipality. There was a woman in charge here. She was doing literally everything. You shouldn't have served her, my friend. No. No. The problem is politics is dirty. We made an ambush on her, but God saved him. I was this close to the bullet. [in Dari] Hey, come here! This is the person who shot me. [in Pashto] On that day, I was almost killed. It's good that I survived! [laughs] [Karima in German] "Father." [in Dari] Uh... V has the sound of F, right? [in German] "Father." "Father." [in Dari] Together we've learned "Guten tag. Guten tag." [Zarifa in Pashto] It's been four months, and I'm sick of it. Even if the world explodes, I must go back once. I will spend one night there. I must do this at least to awaken my generation, and, specifically, to awaken my gender. I can't not do this. And if they kill you? [Zarifa] If I die, I will die for a reason. [sombre music playing] [Bashir in English] I am with you. [phone dial tone sounds] - [Zarifa in Pashto] Hello. - [Taliban contact] How are you? [Zarifa] Now about my return, I want to put politics aside. [Taliban contact] In general, there are no obstacles. [Zarifa in Dari] Now that Kabul is under the control of the Taliban, Afghanistan no longer makes the news headlines. People are talking about Ukraine. And the Taliban are using this opportunity to become worse again. They have imprisoned the protesting girls and women. They promised to reopen the girls' schools, but they haven't. THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD [in English] Oh my God! THERE IS ONLY ONE GOD [knocking on door] [in Dari] Hello! [in Pashto] Oh God. Come here all of you! [kisses] [TV presenter in Dari] My guest is Zarifa Ghafari, the former mayor of Maidan Wardak. - Ms Ghafari, thank you for joining us. - [Zarifa] Thank you. [TV presenter] You've returned to Kabul. What's the purpose of your visit? The Taliban need to work to gain the approval of more than half the population, the women. I call upon all elders and rulers in the current government of Afghanistan, if they still have any women protesters in jail, to set them free for their human dignity. We, women, are ready for a dialogue. Let's have a dialogue to resolve our issues. Here is a question addressed directly to you personally. Have you forgiven your father's murderers? If it heals any pain, and prevents other Zarifas from becoming orphans or another Abdul Wasi from dying, then yes. [phone dings] "Zarifa Ghafari was a nobody." "It is obvious how she got the position as a mayor." "She has no humanity and no morality." [breathes deeply] [phone dings] Some people are saying that I have made a huge mistake. People are saying I have done a deal with my father's murderers. It makes me disappointed. [phone dings] Anyone who wants to help the people is accused of whitewashing the Taliban. But I still believe that I am doing the right thing. And I am sure that I am not wrong. [chanting Arabic prayer] [sombre music playing] [Massoum in Pashto] Now I see the people who were holding guns against me and who wanted to kill me. I'm not sure if the way they laugh with me is a laugh of love or hate. Does life or death lie behind this laughter? My destiny awaits me behind the laughter. [Zarifa in Dari] The people of Afghanistan didn't choose this for themselves. This government was imposed on us by the international community. [water running] [in Pashto] Bring that over here for me. [Zarifa in Dari] The people of Afghanistan have been condemned to live in hell. [in Pashto] Ladies, I am the owner of this school. [in Dari] This is not just about learning, but also to see how I can help you, if you decide to start something on your own in the future. What matters is to use this opportunity to learn something. We will stand strong, work and struggle. We do it for ourselves. ASSISTANCE AND PROMOTION FOR AFGHAN WOMEN [hopeful music playing] [in Pashto] Here is a little rice, sugar, and some oil. Give it to this woman, please. [in Dari] Who's ever seen a female suicide bomber? Who? In this country, whenever there was a war, the men started it. - Let's pray for our country's prosperity. - [man] Amen. Pray that a woman becomes president to rebuild this country. Let's lock all men up at home and tell them not to leave the house, otherwise our Islam will be at risk. Men, leave now! Otherwise, my religion will be endangered by the sight of you. No, I'm joking with you. Should I take down this woman's number? Yes! Don't make yourself so tired. I am from this country. This is my place. I need to be here to help. I am joining this storm. Let's see where it will head. But I have faith. [chattering]
