So you know me. I end up hitting it right there in the parking lot. What? Hell nah. I mean what can I say? I mean we obviously couldn't go anywhere else. That's cold, boy. I believe it though. My man always comes through. Straight guerrilla pimp. Yeah, you know. You know being a pretty good night all things considered. Pretty good? Homie, I seen the girl. She was fine. That's a perfect end to a perfect night. But she ain't cook you breakfast? You ain't get your three squares? Nah, man. Worse. Wait what? It's what happened after that. Wait what? Do I even wanna know? What man? I got some unfortunate information. Dog, this is Hesperia. What else is knew? On the way home after the game, I ran into Big Jake, or should I say Big Jake ran into me. This fool. Dang dog. I thought you were gonna say you scratched her ride or lost your keys. Man, forget that fool. What'd he say? Let's just say he had some strong words for me. I mean I get it. I did break his wrists. You did break his wrists. But as charming as I am, I was able to talk him off that ledge and that was that. Yo, let's pop that fool. It ain't that simple. Homie, it's that simple. I got the heat in the ride right now. Look. I'll go tonight. Bro. Bro. Bro, man what? No one trusts him. No one likes him. Granted those are traits of a true gangster, but I mean we ain't gotta keep doing business with a man like that. We don't need him. Look, it's been a peaceful time here and we gotta respect that. There hasn't been any conflict between the neighborhoods in years and I intend to keep it that way. Plus the main goal is profit. Everything else is a setback. Besides, whether you want to admit it or not, we need him. Nah, we don't need him. We just supposed to let him slide? Look I'm saying though. Ain't nothing cool about being locked up. I know you don't know what that's like, but I'm not going back. And that's what's gonna happen if I stay here. If you stay here? What do you mean if you stay here? You finally tucking tail? Turning your back on your boys, huh? Nah, it's not like that, bruh. Better start explaining, cuz. You sound shook. Look man, after all these years. All the bloody messes. All the dope. Chris getting shot in the face. Moms dying right in front of my eyes. I'm done, homie. How many skulls are left to crack in Hesperia? Homie, you can't tell me this ain't the easiest money you made off these crystal heads, man. Look, slinging meth to fiends ain't my idea of easy. I'm tired of looking over my shoulder. I'm tired of white women clutching they purse every time I walk by. I'm tired of making money off of sick people. Homie, you providing these people with a service, man. Man, there's better ways. Like what? I don't know if you notice. We ain't exactly the suit and tie type. What you gonna do? Roll up to Wells Fargo like can I help you with your personal banking, miss? Look at this point, anything's better getting ran up on by some meth head. Homie, that's why we stay strapped. Never leave home without it. See that's exactly my point. Sooner or later one of us is gonna get caught. I hate to be the one to say it but it's true. Look, it's been too quiet for too long. People are looking for us to keep the peace, man. That's why you're gonna have to run a tight ship and watch your back. Watch my back? Yo what is all this? Watch my back. If you stay. Homie, you acting real shook, man. Ever since Big Jake rolled up on you. Watch my back. If you stay. What's going on with you, man? Yo, we don't need him. We can run this ship like we been running it. No one else. You and me. Think about it, dog. Look, I am thinking about it every day. I got a family that needs me, man. I got a mom that can't use the bathroom by herself. I got people looking to me to feed them. I got a brother that's one of the smartest kids in his class that's gonna end up just like me if he don't get out of this town and get a real shot at life. I need something else. I gotta make it right for them, even if that means giving up the game. So what you gonna do, man? 'Bout to make that move to L.A. Hollywood? Yeah Hollywood. Look, I have an aunt and uncle that's gonna put me up in Venice until I can find a job. Don't that sound good? It sounds aight. Okay well check it out. On top of that, since all my dope money is going to my mom's treatment, my boy's gonna hook me up with a real job. Maybe like a mechanic. Then move up doing kits. Something I actually like. Something I'm actually good at it. Not running around slinging base to meth heads. Going to Hollywood, huh? Slinging and banging your way to the top. Mister Hollywood. Yeah you know me. Mister Hollywood. Yeah, just don't get caught up in the silicons. You know what I'm saying? And all the fakeness. Man. Look man. You been down since day one. And you know all the boys got mad respect for you for real. No doubt. But it's about to be some changes. You gonna have to move up. It's time for you to take over. I mean you know all this, man. You know it better than I do. You been watching me forever, man. Plus Jared's getting older, so you know he can pick up the slack. So you know you got this. And plus you the only person I can trust. Listen man. You know I got your back from day one. Wherever you go, wherever you at. Always have, always will. Plus I always wanted a promotion. Well, we on the same page then. What is it? Back off. It's trash. Close it next time. Yo ladies. Yo ladies, where y'all headed? Drop your phone, ladies. Yeah, get off the phone, ladies. Let's go. You guys know you're not supposed to walk and text at the same time. How y'all can text and hold each other's hands? Aw shit. Where y'all headed to? Staying over at Theo's house for the night. Oh shit. I knew these cupcakes were fruity birds. Look at you. Shut up. Look, just make sure you stay out of trouble. Look into getting into watching videos and playing with each other's hair. Yeah, playing with each other's hair. Look, let him alone. Fool's mad 'cause he ain't got no hair. Ha. Get off me. Yo, yo, yo, yo, let's just bounce. Fuck this shit, homie. Fuck you white boy. Make sure you let mom know where you at. They're just stupid. Why does your brother hang out with those losers? Would you rather he hang out with us? No. I thought so, man. Come on. Hey. Hey. What's up? Hey, 20 bucks. Oh be quiet. Make sure to turn the hose off. So what's mom making for tonight? I don't know. Probably the same old thing. Cool, cool, cool. Yeah, but you get the dog food. What? Shut up. Hey, have you seen this video? Dude, that's tight. I love when that laser comes out of his chest like that. Yeah man, it's got like a couple hundred thousand views. What? Yeah, my friend made it, too. Dude, that's sick. You boys remember to take your shoes off. Go wash your hands. Your father will be here any minute and dinner is ready. Smells really good, Missus C. I don't know how you boys can watch the same video a thousand times. How was school today? Same. Same. Go wash your hands. Ow. Are you gonna wear your hat at dinner? Yeah. I hate lasagna. Then don't eat it. Matt. Theo, did you do your chores today? Yeah. Matt, does your mom know you're here? Uh huh. Theo, I'm gonna need your help this weekend. Got a bunch of stuff to take to the dump. Theo, did you hear what I just said? Yeah, I did my chores. What's with the videos? I don't get it. Theo, put the phone down. Matt, you too. Now did you hear what I said about going to the junkyard this weekend? Yeah okay, dad. Turn the phone off. Can we get through one dinner without you two using your phones? Matt, how's your mom? Good. And your brother? Fine. You two really don't know what to talk about without your phones, do you? What do you mean? I mean, talking to one another. Interacting. Doing things that other kids would do. Kids talk and text on their phones. No, kids go outside like I did when I was a kid. But they didn't have cell phones when you were a kid right? That's a joke. What other things interests you kids besides texting and just watching videos all day long? I mean, if we had an Xbox, we'd have other interests. What's an Xbox? A video game. It's a console. Just saying. What would you do for an Xbox? - Anything. - Anything. Tell you what. If you can go an entire night without using your cell phones I'll consider getting you an Xbox. What do you mean without our cell phones? I mean not using your phones for an entire night until the morning for any reason. How do we do that? We agreed? Agreed. Uh, uh, uh, uh, no, no, no. Hand them over. What? Hand them over. Theo. Hand it over. Dude. You too, Matt. Xbox. I'm gonna lock your cell phones in this drawer 'til morning. Don't worry. They'll be safe. What are we supposed to do now? You could help with the dishes. Really? That's the point. Figure it out. Can we be excused? Yes. Wonderful lasagna, Missus C. Super nice. What the hell took so long? It's been hours. I didn't think you were coming back. Did you get the stuff? You gonna answer me or what? What? What's wrong with you? Nothing, man. It's just look, it's been a long day. I just wanna get high. Yeah well it's hot as well. We have no beer. I feel like I'm gonna die. Look man, it just took a little more this time okay. What is that even supposed to mean? It means that it costs more this time than it did the last time, idiot. Now just back off and let me get high. So what? You needed more money? How'd you get more money? Are you holding out on me? Look, dude I took care of it all right. So just chill out. Chill out. Chill out. No, no, I can't chill out. What did you do? Are we in trouble? Why does everything have to be so dramatic with you? All right? You sound like Javier right now. Just relax. Oh god. You killed him, didn't you? What are we gonna do? What are we gonna do? Look man, the guy just raised his prices a little okay. I got the dope, didn't I? That was all I had. I took everything from my dad's stash. You know I can't even pay you back. I'm dead broke right now. How much do we even get? The hell is that? What does it look like? You said it costs more money so where's the rest of it? Don't mess with me, Chase. Look, I've had a rough day all right. I just wanna get high right now and forget that I ever even woke up this morning okay. When you decide to grow a pair and you're the one that's out there dealing with the dope dealers, then I'll actually entertain a conversation with you. Okay? These guys don't mess around when it comes to this stuff. All right? And I'm out there taking all the risks while you sit here on your ass all day and collect your welfare. This was all I could get. So do you wanna keep getting high or not? I don't know about you, man, but that's not enough. I'm really starting to hurt. Yeah and so am I. I don't know how long I can do this. I need more and this is not enough to last 'til tomorrow. So what do you want me to do? I don't know how long I can do this. This small time nickel and dime bag stuff. Living $20 at a time. We need to take it up a notch. What do you mean take it up a notch? There are some days if I don't get high, I feel like I might die. So then why don't you quit, huh? Move out. Get your little life figured out or something like that and leave me the hell alone. I am serious right now. Well what do you want me to do about it, man? We're broke. We don't have rent. I don't even know what I'm gonna be eating tomorrow. How can you think about food right now? Look man, I'm gonna be at the welfare office tomorrow. Okay? I'll fill out paperwork and I'll see what I can do. We'll be fine. Why would you be at the welfare office if you have a job? You got fired again, didn't you, Chase? I didn't get fired. All right listen look. It's my boss, all right. He's had it out for me since day one. No one can stand their boss. Look man, it's not my fault all right. The guy's like hated me for years or something like that. I don't know. And how am I supposed to get any work done when he's breathing down my neck all the time? He's impossible to work for. Yeah right. Just like your last job and your job before that. It's always someone else who has a problem with you. Have you ever thought just maybe that the problem is you? Me? Me? Really? Look man, I do everything around here okay. I work my ass off all day and I get all the drugs and what do you do? You do nothing. You sit here and you just smoke the drugs and that's it. Why don't you do something for once? You think of something. This sucks. I seriously need to check my Facebook and I wanted to post that video we shot yesterday at the tracks. Dude, you gotta chill down all right. Chill out. This is nothing all right. Calm down. And you're not gonna have any hits, by the way. You're just a big ole loser. I'm the popular one all right. Yeah right. I've seen your posts. They're terrible. Nobody cares about BMX riding. That's where you're wrong, man. That's where you're wrong because those guys are awesome and they put their life on the line every single time they get on a bike. Way better than stoner skateboarding. Yeah, skateboarding is definitely more chill, which makes it cooler. Seriously though, what did we do before cell phones? I'm bored out of my mind right now. I'd even play chess I'm so bored. Dude, Xbox, Xbox, Xbox. Plus, if you're so bored, why don't you go get it? It's in the drawer. You're going insane. Yeah, I know. Come on, let's play this game. Let's get serious right now. You're not even playing the game right. You're not even playing the game at all. Line up the balls, idiot. All right, all right. Let's do it. I don't know how to set it up. You set it up. I don't know how to set it up. You set it up. No, you set it up. Dude, I don't know how to play this. Oh, just a reminder that I'm working overtime tomorrow, so you'll have to run errands for us. Oh and I won't be home for dinner, so you're gonna have to get groceries. There should be enough charcoal if you wanna use the grill. I always do. Would it kill you to eat a vegetable once in awhile? Nope. Real men eat steak. Enough with the hat in the house already. It's a wonder why you haven't had a heart attack yet and Theo's so skinny, the way you boys eat. Like father, like son. Dude, what was up with your dad tonight though? He seemed really pissed off. So did your mom. Well your mom always seems kind of pissed off. They're always pissed off. What else is new? Yeah, but even more so tonight. Yeah, I don't know. I think they've been fighting a lot lately. I think it has something to do with the ranch and they're being really cryptic about it, but I could care less 'cause I'm out of here in two years. Got ya. Are they having some kind of financial troubles? Beats me. They never tell me anything like ever. They still treat me like a child and it's getting really old. Can you go check on them please? No, I can't check on them. They're not 10 anymore. What do you think they're doing in there that requires me to check on them every five minutes? Think they're burning down the house? No, I'm afraid that's something that you'll do. Yeah right. Would you relax? It would just break my heart if something were to happen. As polite as that kid seems, I know he hangs out with a bad crowd. I know his brother is in a gang and I know they do stuff. I'm not stupid. And I know for a fact that that brother has been in jail. Don't you think you're being a little bit judgmental here. You can't prove one thing against that kid and his family and I happened to know they have a pretty rough time, especially with that kid's dad being addicted to drugs. That's not our Theo. He wouldn't mess around with his life like that. How do you know? Trust me. I think your mom hates me, bro. What? Shut up, man. No, she doesn't. She does. She does. She looks at me all funny all the time. Like I did something. I didn't do anything. She doesn't hate you, man. She's just nervous and she worries a lot. I don't know blame her. Yeah. Wow. She looks at me really weird. Like super weird. Like she doesn't trust me or something. Dude, I haven't done anything. Not yet. You're paranoid. It's your shot. All right, all right. I am sick of this tough guy approach to parenting. Show him some discipline. What do you want me to do? He hasn't done anything. What's that? Did they go outside? Could you go check? It's just the wind hitting the gate. Such a stomachache. Probably from all those drugs you've been taking. No wonder why you have a stomachache. Please don't throw guilt on me right now all right. Enough. And besides, Doctor Grant says that my dosage is on the low end compared to what other people in my condition take. Condition? Do you know how much stress I am in? What stress? You sit around home all day. I work six days a week. You have the nerve to say that to me? I work, too, and I take care of this house. I mean, I cook. How do you think your work clothes get clean and back into your drawer? Do you think that's the laundry fairy? You know what? You are no help. Go read your paper. I know what we can do, man. I got a plan. Yeah? Let's see if you can use this little brain of yours for once. What do we do when we need something? I hate riddles. What? We take it. You have lost your mind. What are you talking about? I'm not going after some dope dealers. Are you insane? They have guns. They have no regard for human life. If you wanna go after them, be my guest, but I just like to get high and be alive so I can get high. Not the drug dealers, numb nuts. What do you think I'm stupid or something? Like I'm just gonna go in there guns blazing. Well you're sound a little stupid right now. Think about it, man. You know how many rich, defenseless little families live just a few miles from here? Think about it. We scope a couple places out. Figure out who's home and who's not. We go in. We help ourselves to some valuables. I mean we pick a place that's far enough away that it'll take forever for like cops or anyone else to get to. It's easy money, man. I don't know. I mean we're on parole. This would be my third strike. All right well if you have a better plan, I'm all ears. It would have to be in the hills, but those folks are the type that have guns under their pillows. Oh please. Like they've ever shot it. What about parole? That's exactly my point. This is really low risk. You know a lot of these places, the closest neighbors are like miles away. It's the easiest money we've ever made, man. In and out before anyone knows that we're there. All right, we can take whatever we want. Those people in the hills have money, man. I mean at this point what else do we have to lose? It's tempting. I'm talking like cash, jewelry, iPhones, whatever. Look, the best part is if we do this right, no one gets hurt, no one gets caught, and no one will even know that we're there. It's not so much of a bad idea I guess. You and I both know dudes are gonna front for stuff like this. Javier's brother has... No, no, no, no, no. Listen, listen. Javier's brother, his brother, has a crooked pawn shop. Like a no questions asked type of situation all right. I can even get Javier to help us out. That guy would do anything for a bump. You know three sets of eyes are gonna be a lot better than two in something like this and he can help us carry more. No way. Javier is wack. I never thought I would say this my whole life, but that guy smokes way too much. See, he's a really great guy, but he's not the most inconspicuous. He's not that bad. Not that bad. The guy hit an old woman in a grocery store. And that laugh? Not so subtle. Look man, he'll be fine all right. He'll do whatever I say. He always listens to me. Look, I know that he's your dear old friend, but Javier has problems. He'll get us caught. Look man, we need Javier okay. It'll be a lot easier that way to get into his brother's shop. I mean unless you wanna do like a garage sale in the alley. He'll be fine. I don't know. I mean he's cool but... Look he's in all right. He's in. Three heads are a lot better than two in this type of thing. He'll be fine. He won't be a problem. We need the extra hands. If we're gonna do it, then we gotta do it right. No hiccups. Yeah, 'cause I totally wanna do this the wrong way, moron. Fine. I don't know how I always let you talk me into this. It's because I'm the brains and you are the welfare check. Now let's go. What? We're gonna do it now? We're doing it tonight. Come on. Let's get Javier. I'm gonna take a dump first. Do you really think your dad's gonna get you an Xbox? I don't know. Probably not. It sounds too good to be true. And Eileen would probably convince him to shoot it down. I bet my dad would've hated stuff like that. Like what? Like Xboxes, phones, and technology and stuff. He didn't even get a computer 'til after he passed. He never even saw an iPhone. Yeah, well my dad. He still thinks chopping wood is a better use of my time. At least you have a dad. Dude, you know what I mean. If they scratch the felt on that table one more time, I am gonna lose it. And I'm not paying for it again. I've had enough. You're paying for it. You're the one who put them in there. Can you hear me? Yeah fine. What did I say? Pool table scratch. I'm paying for it. Mister Allen called today. You know Mister Allen from the bank? The only other man in my life that has the ability to piss me off. Well what are you gonna do? Are we just gonna sit here and be intimidated listening to that man, that jerk or whoever 'cause you say you're gonna handle it? I told you not to worry about it. Well I am worried about it. I don't think you realize how serious this is. We could lose this house. He's annoying. Yeah, but you're lucky. Look, you have all of this. I have nothing. So, it could be a lot worse. What does that mean? At least you know you're gonna be here for awhile. What? When I tell you I'm gonna handle something, I handle it. How many times I gotta tell you that? I'll handle it. Yeah, well how many times? I mean you just sit there and you let things roll off your back as long as you have your chair and your drink. As soon as I get the okay for the city, they'll issue me the permit. When that happens, they'll spot me the money. How many times I gotta tell you that? When? Hm? I think we're moving, man. Moving? Like down the street. Out of town. What? Why? Mom's taking the turn for the worse and she needs to be closer to better hospitals and better care and we just can't afford to be out here anymore with her in her condition. All right, I'm sorry. Is she gonna be okay? Yeah, for now. My brother's been paying the bills. She can get the care that she deserves, but the doctor says she needs to go to L.A. for better treatment, and she can't keep going back and forth anymore, so she might move in with my aunt and uncle in Venice. I'm sorry, man. Me too. I talked to the guy today. We're a go. Oh but until the end of this week and then that'll turn into the next week and then that'll be the next week and the next week and the next week. I'm really sick of this. When are you gonna do this? I don't think you realize how serious this is. I mean what about Theo? What about Theo? I don't think you realize that you're toying with his future, Gary. So what about you? What about me? What are you gonna do? Not sure yet. My brother might have some kind of connections in Venice with his friend's autobody shop. They've been talking about getting into business forever. Like pimping out cars or whatever. So I might get a job with him. He's already taught me a lot. I thought your brother was a drug dealer. Shut up, man. What? He is. He's not. He's more like a business man. He's an entrepreneur. Right. Entrepreneur. Listen, he's doing what he has to do for all of us. He's taking risks. And he's doing it for me and my mom. I get it. It's just it sucks. Yeah, I know, but things will get better. I mean it's Venice Beach. Have you ever been down to L.A.? There's so many babes, dude. Right. The babes 'cause you're so popular with the girls in our class. They're just banging down your door huh? Wow. Whatever. You know what I mean. Come on, I'm trying to stay positive. All right babes. Got it. Babes. Theo will be fine. I told you the day that he moved into this house that he wouldn't have to worry about anything. Fine. I'll just worry. You'll be the laid back parent. Dad who buys presents when anything goes wrong. Shut up. No. I mean you promised him an Xbox. I mean how is that any different from having his face in his stupid phone all day? You take one toy away and then you give him another? How stupid can you be? How 'bout a book for once? Boy's brain's gonna turn into mush. Sh. He's gonna hear you. Good, fine. Let him hear it. Why can't I get him nice things? So he's had a little bit of trouble lately. He's a teenager. That's what they do. They mess up and they learn from it. He's a good kid. I know it in my guts. Well I hate to break it to your manly gut, but it isn't that he's just getting into trouble. His grades are slipping. He's not inspired by anything. All he wants to do is keep hanging out with that kid, whose brother I know is in a gang. He's not motivated to do anything. He needs a strong father. He needs discipline. Okay, I'll take him to work with me this weekend. Great. Hard labor. What is it with you and men and torture? Builds character. Right. Unbelievable. I mean when are you gonna care, Gary? I mean you don't care about anything anymore. You used to care about this house and Theo and me. We don't go to the movies anymore like as a family like we used to. That used to be your favorite thing. You spend more time with the chickens than you do with me. You just sit there. Everything just rolls off your back. I told you I'll handle it. Yeah, you'll handle it. Fine. You know what? I need you to do something. I need you to be a father okay. Will you just shut up? Not when it comes to my family I don't. All right? I mean that kid has a second chance to have a family and it would break my heart if he is denied a father. Look, I love Theo as if he was my own kid. You know that. I don't want anybody to mess with that. Well then start acting like it. Fine. I'm done. So when is all this going down? Do you have a date yet? No, not sure yet, but I think sooner than later. Eddie's already been back and forth making arrangements and somebody already wants to move into our apartment, so I'm thinking a month, maybe two. Wow. Okay then soon. Yeah. I'm sorry, man. But hey, we'll see each other soon though and we'll hang out like every single day before I leave. Looks like I'll be visiting you in L.A. then. Better get a room ready for me. Whoa, whoa, whoa. Who said you're invited? You loser. Dude, how do you play this thing? I've never played this. It's open. Let's go Buzz Lightyear. Who leaves a door open at night? Sh. Hey. Theo. Theo. What? Did you hear that? Hey. Hey. Tell the boys to stop making noise. It's just the kids horsing around. Hey, it's late. Tell them to go to bed. All right, all right, all right, all right. Theo, you heard that. The door's locked. Move. Come on, come on, come on. The hell are you guys doing? Gar? Gar? Gary? Gary? Shut up. That was awesome. Can we get high now? Let's go. Come on. Come on. Yo, it is like the Bates Motel in here, you guys. Hey, hey, hey, hey. What the hell are you doing? This is dope. All right man, rack 'em up. I think we should get the hell out of here. We should get the hell out of here. Yeah, you're right. Let's just. I don't know. Grab some stuff then. Sh, y'all hear that? Shut up. Okay, just grab something. Come on find something. Let's grab some stuff. Hey numb nuts, it's too big. Look for something different then. Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah. It's too big. Ooh. Why do we roll with this fucking idiot? I know. Who knows? Dude, what are we gonna do about the dead bodies? What are we gonna do about 'em? What are we gonna do with the dead bodies? I don't know. I didn't know that any of this stuff was gonna go down. Yeah, again we should just get out of here. Yeah, we should. Knock it off. Stop. You had a bug, man. I do not. Wow, I never killed anybody before. It's amazing. Adrenaline going through your body. Never? Really? Okay but I'm not feeling well. We should just go. I'm not either. Just I don't know. Look for some money or something all right. Let's just go. Let's look for some money. Stop it. Where we gonna find the money? I don't know. Just look for it all right. Where'd you guys come from? Get off of me. Got any money in the house? Don't touch me. Don't touch me. Kid, do you have money in the house? I don't live here. I don't live here. Get off me. It's not starting. Come on. It's not starting. How you little guys doing? Leave us alone. We won't say anything. Shut up. So what do we do with them? I don't know. Let's make some chicken noodle soup.

Let's just get high here. We don't have time to get high. Think of a plan. Seriously. Let's get high. Do you think he's dumb enough to go back to the house? Yeah maybe. Yeah hey. When we go back, we're gonna look in the house for him. If we find him, we take care of him. If not, grab some stuff and then we're gonna head out. All right? Sounds good. I bet mom's got some good food in there. We already got a piece of that. You know what I'm saying? Jewelry. Jewelry, idiot. You know diamonds a girl's best friend. Seriously let's go. I don't know about this. I don't know where he is. Hey. Who you calling, little buddy? He got away. You let him get away? He's faster than he looks. Really? Man, now I'm really getting pissed off. We're all pissed off all right. Let's go. Seriously why are we still here? Right. We killed those people all right. We gotta finish this. We? You must be jacked. I ain't kill anybody. This dude's tweaking. This is not fun anymore. This adventure is blowing me, bro. Suck it up. Let's go. Can you carry me? Come on. You go on without me. Go. You don't need me. Knock it off. Let's go. Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down, homie. Slow down. They're coming. Hold on. Who's coming? Those guys chasing me. They killed Matt. What guys are chasing you? Wait a minute. What, what? Those guys there. They killed my parents and they killed Matt. Hey, stand here. Don't move no matter what. Let's do this. Matt. Ayo, there he is. What you got tired of running? I say we kill him now then head back to the house. No, no. There's something wrong here. What we got here? Oh shit. Looks like we got a bunch of pussies. You said they killed my brother? Yeah, they killed him in the chicken coup. Which one of you killed my brother? All three of them. They beat him to death. Where'd you say he was? In the chicken coup. And you just left him there? Get these motherfuckers. Whoa, whoa, whoa. You guys play for the wrestling team. Damn man. Now why would you upstanding gentlemen do something like this? Come on, man. They broke into the kid's crib to get more dope. That's what they do. Something must've went wrong. Tweakers. Y'all like hurting families, huh? You know what they do to guys like you in prison? I was just trying to get high. Yo man, I say we save them some time and kill these fools now. Hell yeah. Ayo chill, y'all. Chill nothing. These fools killed Eddie's brother, man. They're tweakers. They're less than nothing. They don't even exist. They killed Eddie's brother. That's like pulling a hit out on one of us. Yeah but this ain't the same. Man, don't get soft on me. You don't wanna roll with your boys then bounce. Yo, let's just do this right now. Yo you know what? I don't think we should get involved. Maybe we should just call the cops. Yeah, what was the number again? 911, homie. Yeah, I got 'em on speed dial. I say we take matters into our own hands. Yes, let's do this, homie. I'm down. I'm so sorry. We were supposed to leave. We were supposed to leave. We were supposed to leave. Get up. Get up. It wasn't supposed to be like this, but I know how to make it right. Eddie. You leave my brother in the coup, huh? Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo. Get him, Eddie. Killed my homie's brother, huh? What now huh? Dude, I'm out of here. What are we gonna do about him? Yeah, he's gonna be a problem. You ain't gonna say anything are you little man? Yeah big problem. No, no, no. Little problem. Yeah, you just saw us kill three guys. Man look, leave him alone, bruh. He's not gonna say anything. They just killed his parents. Little man you gonna snitch? You didn't hear me the first time? I said leave him alone. He's just a kid. Yo, he's like 13. My brother's been killing people since he was 12, dog. Look, I ain't talking about your messed up family. I'm talking about mine. Oh all right then. We gonna let boss man get us pinched. Sell us out like that old man. You wanna see your crew go to jail? Rot in the cell while your dope sits on the shelf. It's probably the same dope that got these tweakers messed up and killed your brother. So in a roundabout way, this all your fault. Man, what you say to me? Yo, yo, yo, chill homie. That fool is tripping. Look, I'm not gonna say it no more. Leave him alone. No, I promise I won't say anything. You sure you're not gonna say nothing? I promise. Man, why did you do that? There was other ways of keeping him quiet. I just did that. Man, this ain't us, man. That was my brother's homeboy. He had his back. Apparently not. Now all I see is a witness. Yeah dog, I ain't going back to jail. Look, ain't nobody going back to jail, but he don't deserve this either. So what y'all trying to prove by killing a kid? My man grew a heart all of a sudden. Man what happened to you? They just killed his parents, dog. Yeah, and it's gonna look all connected. He had nothing to do with it. He's innocent. He had everything to do with it the second he saw us get down on these tweakers. Ain't nobody innocent. Yeah, I've seen gangsters walk to the cops. Opie is gonna talk. No doubt. Look man, there's other ways, man. We could've moved him out of town. Paid him off. Safe house. Man, at this point he's better off. It's not like he's got a family anymore. Too soon? Chill dog. Just walk it off. Oh how cute. Boys for life. Yeah, turn your back on your real homies. The ones that made you rich. Nah man I'm good. Let's just get the tweakers in the car and get the hell out of here. Eddie, you know he's gonna sing the second he wakes up. Look, you're out. We're done. Whatever boss. No, no, no, no. Man, what's wrong with you, man? Chill, chill, chill, chill, dog. Man, I guess I'm out then. So this our reputation now? Man, the kid was gonna snitch, man. I just did us a huge favor. Yeah, you're welcome, lady. Look man, I can't believe this, man. Look my man, nobody needs to know we were here. Let's just get out of here. What is with you two? This is what some kind of bromance? Look man, let's just figure it out, man. You two put him in the trunk. Really? They ain't gonna fit in here. You got any better ideas? Nah I'm just saying you got all this junk back here. All right then. They'll just have to sit on your lap. Yeah, I think that might be the only way. Dang. Dead fiends ain't sitting on my lap. Man, suck it up. It ain't even over yet. You guys just get 'em in the car. Let's go. So what now? What do you think, fool? Dig some holes. What you ain't never dug a hole? Man, I hate digging. You prefer jail? We'll be at it all night. And you're already complaining. I'm just saying. Yo Eddie, you all right? I'm just ready for this night to be over with. Hey the car's getting away. Do you even know who those people were? No, I don't. Do you know what they're gonna do with the body? Maybe they're gonna dig a hole and put the body in the hole. They might. They may come back here and hide the body. This is a really good place to hide bodies. I wonder if they saw us hiding. Probably not. That was crazy. There was blood everywhere. Dude, it was squirting everywhere. I got the whole thing on video. So did I. Should we tell mom and dad? No, no, no. We'll probably get in trouble for being out without them knowing. Should we call the cops? Probably. But first let's post it on YouTube. Yeah, we'll have lots of likes. Yeah, we'll be famous. Yeah and popular at school. Yeah. Yeah. Awesome.
