WOMEN?S PRISON Come on, go! Hi, Fortun?. - Hi. Fortun?, is your vacation over? - Mind your own business! She?s back. A dress of the latest fashion! It?s ?Miss Striptease?! Take note! We sell at liquidation prices! We sell everything! Look what clothes, gentlemen! Look! Today, I've gone crazy! What?s that stuff? Hey! What?s this? Where did you get it? - Liquidation sale. How much? - 80. - 10. Didn?t you know I was getting out today? Didn?t you know? - Yeah, I did. Boy, get out of the way! 15. 75. - Let's say 20. What? Today I've gone crazy! This model creation "Miss Striptease"! The latest model in pure silk! Come on. Come on. - Then push! I wasn?t paid to go to jail. My pay went to the jail. And you say, "Watch the business, clean, go to the market." Fine, on the one hand. But then you also say, "Feed me, wash me, iron for me!" Fine, then pay me regularly. But what do you mean? I get none of it. - Oh, nice! They say, "He don't pay you 'cause you live together.? ?You're like husband and wife, a sentimental tie." How you fantasize! Husband and wife? Am I your wife? If you wanted to marry, you should?ve asked me first. And when you do, I must say yes, though perhaps I should say no! Come on! What are they throwing? They're throwing stuff. The censer has fallen. What are you saying? Who asked you anything? You?re talking to yourself. So, why did I hafta go to jail in your place? Tell me why. What my place? The license is in your name, you wanted it so. I?m a poor wretch, you can leave me in want whenever you like. Then what can I do? I'll hold on to it. Come on. - Oh, yeah? Wise guy! The license is in my name and will stay so. Meanwhile you have to give me: 1500 lire for the fine, 3000 lire for the week of May, the shoes, the food, and the lodging because I've been in jail, you hear? - How could I not? How could I not hear you? Come on! - Plus, the shoes must be new. And you just put the soles on those. - What did you want shoes for? You went to prison. Come on! Run, run see the prince! Is he going to feed you? It was bad luck. They gave her a pardon and let her out. - Leggo my braid! Then I?ll eat and go. - No, you?ll eat and stay. Because you are the boss. - The boss? And her? She's a servant: washes for me, irons, puts my stuff in the drawers... Why not send her away? She must also wait on you. I can?t send her away. The license is in her name. Look, if she comes, I'm leaving. She?s not going to say anything to you! She has no right to tell you nothing. How beautiful you are when you eat! My cousin, Amelia. Sit down. - A pleasure. You see her? - A pleasure. I'll ask for soup to start. It relaxes the nervous system. Stimulates the gastric juices. How is she your cousin? - By blood. Are you kidding? She has come from her village. She have a home in Rome? - Of course! She?s come from family. Aren?t you eating? Giulio! Come. You're killing me! Turn it off! Turn it off! Turn it off! Damn it! Is the pain I suffered nothing? And you, letting them send you to jail! You think I let myself be put in jail for fun? Who had to pay the fine? Leave the pills. They?re good for my pharyngitis. I had to teach everything to her. 100%. If not, who would?ve stayed at the shop? Luckily, she was there. Well, I?m going to bed. I'm sleepy. Good night. - Good night, beautiful. Be patient, you'll have to make a sacrifice for tonight. "Patience"... ...as one would say. When I think of the poor... who sleep under bridges. On bare earth, out in the open. On a scary night. Are we so bad off? Do we lead a showy life? Let's look behind us! Who is behind us? The needy... The abandoned... He who is worse off than us... and we feel sorry. We are sorry. Let's be sorry! Sorry! Sorry! Very good. Be sorry! Shame! But let's be content, It's about resting these few tired bones... for three or four hours. Not much else. What can you do? Oh, God! Oh, God! I'll put myself on one side, as if she weren't there. Tomorrow we?ll fix everything. Tomorrow we?ll put a bed in the kitchen. - For who? Oh, mamma mia! Mamma mia, what a headache! It?s like a bomb. Tomorrow I?ll go to the doctor. Tomorrow I'll have them give me an injection... - Oh, my braid! The braid... You hurt the braid. I feel a little bad. I need to heal. Mamma mia! My eyes burn! How my mind hurts! I need affection... Nothing more. Oh, mamma mia! Mamma mia! Oh, God! - What's going on? - Mamma mia! I went to jail because of you, and you?re in bed with your cousin? What do you want? Who are you? Who told you to yell? - Who is the bed in the kitchen for? For me? I don?t even want her in the kitchen! Get her out of here and back to her village! Now! Immediately! - Who the hell are you? Are you my wife? You are my employee, I pay you! I bring who I want into my house! So if you don?t like it, leave! - Get her out! Right away! - Who? Come here! Throw her out! - Who? Get off her! Throw her out! - Who? I'm going to fire you! Grab the mat and go! - Me? - Oh, God! Throw me out? I feel sick! Go! - Now I'll go to the police station. I'm going to tell everything. That you buy merchandise from Peppe. From Peppe "The Moor". And then I tell them about Palestrina. That you take the money from the usurer. I'm going to tell all! All! I'm going to ruin you! Criminal! - Where are you going? What do you want? - Can't I do what I like? Must I do it like this? - No! Beat it! - No? - No! Beat it! Hey, you! What are you doing? Who are you? - If you?re looking for matches, they?re in my pant?s pocket. But what are you doing there? Be careful you?re not arrested. Are you crazy? No, no. They never say anything at this time of night. "Clear, fresh and sweet water"... Come on, take a bath too. It's wonderful. Yeah, I'll do that! - Don?t you like water? Inside of it hides one of the greatest secrets of life. The feeling of letting go, of expansion... Water is our mother. It is the element from which all the living creatures originate. "At first, the Earth was totally void," "and the Spirit of the Lord moved on the face of immense waters." What are you talking about? How well you do it. You look like a fish. I bet I can stay under water for 70 seconds. Let's bet 500 lire. You have it? - Do you? Look in the pocket of my pants. I put 500 lire and you 500 more. OK? Rummage all you want, it's all there. Up to what? - Up to 70. Look, I?m counting to 80. Stay under, or I get the 500 lire. OK? This is mine, eh? - Agreed. If I may? Professor Golfiero Paganica. - Nanda Diotallevi. Then, agreed. One, two... - Up to 90, OK? Fine. 1, 2, 3! 4, 5, 6, 7, 8... 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23... 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43, 44... But what is he doing? 61, 62, 63, 64... 84... 85, 86, 87, 88, 89... 90. No! Eh, no! Where are you going? That?s not right. A promise is sacred. A lady must know how to lose. What does money matter? I demand the 500 lire from you. - Wise guy! Stop joking around! Give me back the 500 lire! No, no, you're wrong. I don?t have to pay because I won. Out with the money! I don?t like to argue with nuts! Give me back my money! - So sorry, but it was you who lost, and it is you who must pay. Hey! Do you think you're gonna cheat me like that? Gimme back my money! - No, no, no... I'll kill you, you know? Give me back the money, damn it! I won?t give it to you... I'm going to the police station, I'll report you. I?ll break your head! Dammit! Gimme my money! Give it to me or I'll send you to jail! Gimme the money! I won?t give you anything. Just wait...! Why, I'll...! - Did you get stained? - Jerk! Son of a... - You think I did it? Now you'll learn, dirty bitch. Throwing rotten tomatoes. - Hey! It wasn?t me. What have you done, bitch? Hey, come here. What do you want? Do I know you? No, I assure you she didn?t do it on purpose, only an unlucky mistake. The lady is with me. The tomato was for me. - You see? The lady is with you? Nice. So I get a tomato in the face? And I must thank you? - No, no, no! Excuse me. No, no. Better you don't touch me, got it? Take that! - Let's get him! Watch out! You too? Cowards! Holy Virgin! The bag. Professor! Come on! Cheer up! Wait. Wait a bit. Blow. Harder! You need a little water. - A coffee would be better. Come, Professor. - My papers. Forget the papers, don?t you see they?re peppered with blood? More than coffee you need alcohol. You're right! Alcohol! Come on. I know a place, a tavern that is open late. Who?ll pay? - This is who?ll pay. Here it is! With my money! - That I won! My treat. Lambrusco is a great wine. Please. - No more. - No, please, Miss. Your health! Lambrusco is a generous wine that strengthens the blood. It's good? Good. Give me some. Thank you. Your health. I wrote and held my sword on high so that taverns should have a night shift, like pharmacies. It's useless to write in the papers. Like talking to the wind! But what do you do? Write in the newspaper? It?s all done to drag along the painful burden of existence. And do they pay well? Only lies are rewarded generously. But I love the truth! Although, unfortunately, today truth is in the balance, dear girl. Lie then. - I wish. Your health. The trumpet sounds, for the strong and brave... "I Puritani", you know it? - And how! (A distortion of a famous Italian song that has nothing to do with "I Puritani") Great! It reminds me of a wonderful bed where I slept in Florence. A patriarchal bed, which would please me tonight because I'm tired. I don?t like the idea of sleeping on a staircase. Do you have a house? What, don?t you have a house? Are you in the streets? - Temporarily. But the nights here are so splendid! How come? A man like you, an educated man who writes for the papers and gets paid well... You're sleeping in the streets? But you who can will write lies, no? - Never! Damn it! If I only could write lies, Professor! Why? Don?t you have a house either? What does that matter? I don?t write for the papers. But I had a house. Home, business, license, I had it all. Now that beggar has it who brings in his cousin and puts her in my place. Damn! I've spent 4 years working "on the inside"! I did everything: wash, iron, carry the cart, sell, and I should've been married. No, Sir, the cousin arrives and he wants to put her in the bed! Olivaro, come here! - Take it, go on. No more. Give me a cone. Make it big, eh. Here. Pay him. Damn it, if my father knew! Because I?m the daughter of Prince Guidobaldi. Got it? Don Pietro Guidobaldi? His daughter? - Probably illegitimate. - Don Pietro Guidobaldi... Ah! The Guidobaldi de Sovana in Lanciano! Sovana's fiefdom was granted to the family after the Crusades. So you're Don Pietro's daughter. Perhaps. The most unlikely things are the truest. That's what makes life... No, thanks. ... so beautiful, the fascinating air... May I? - Oh, excuse me. - May I? - Move it. Excuse me. Have a drink. Have a drink. - Move away. - Hey, have a drink. Here. It's finished! Let?s go! - I?m going. Excuse me. Yes, it's true. Because when I was a kid, when I was that small, being that I?m an orphan, I was already living in the palace basement. - The palace? Yes, I was always there. And I had a lady who worked inside the palace. Well, one day the prince passed by, the one who is now old, Don Pietro... The prince? - And he said, "Hello, Maria, how are you?" Then he picked me up. And I almost cried... Almost, eh! And do you know what he said? - Yes. - "My poor girl, my poor girl." And he looked at me, he looked at me... And do you know what else he said? "She?s the living portrait of my poor grandmother." No! - That portrait exists! Really? - And it looks like me. Looks like you? - Exactly! - Exactly. I know it. - Me too. - 'Cause I see it all the time. Understand? Castel Sant'Angelo! How much blood was spilled there! Don Pietro knows the history. There's Golfiero. - Hey? - Golfiero! Golfiero! - "Cavalieri" of the night! Here you have me. Princess, I'm going away. Fate separates us. Goodbye, Princess! - Princess! Pirelli S.A., 3820. Condotte, 415. Acquamarcia, 1193. Italgas, 1135. Liquigas, 357. Currency exchange: US Dollar, 624.80. Canadian dollar, 630.58. Swiss franc, 145.80. These were the closing values current and official of the Rome Stock Exchange. The market is quiet today. But I say it will recover. - The radio is boring! Not even a little song. - Later, Amelia, later they'll play songs. You want some coffee, Amelia? Heavens, no! Coffee makes me nervous. Yes, a little. - Me too. Do you know what we can do next? Get a nice ice cream. Very good! - Eh? I like it. - Maybe an ice cream yes, but later. Put this one. - I don?t see any. - This. Ah. - Here, and this one here. You know you?re very good? I never can get it. Bah, maybe I have a gift. Sure, Nanda is good. She has an eye. She?s got a clever eye. She's quick as a hare, our Nandaccia. Everyone has their good points. - Behave. I don?t know why, but I feel like ice cream today. So, you want an ice cream? Hey! You want ice cream? Yes, maybe a cone. I'm going to show you a magic trick. Stand up. Pick a card. Amelia! - What? Won?t you come down for the ice cream? - Bring it to me. I can?t. I got things to do. Amelia! It?ll melt! Amelia! What is this yelling I?m hearing? What is this? - No! - Oh, my God! Oh, God! Stop! Stop! Mamma mia, he killed himself! Peppi'! Peppi '! Mamma mia, you?ve killed yourself! Did you slip? Be careful, Peppino. What happened? Oh, my God! Get up, Peppino. Oh, mamma mia! What a tremendous blow! Let's go to the fountain. - I went headlong down the stairs! Oh God, what a trap! Jerk! What? Can?t I clean the stairs? I can't even clean the stairs! Come down, God in heaven! Help your child, help him! My father... Damn! Where are you going? The day will come when you will know me. Blood is blood. One day I will go to see you and tell you everything. Then, we will live together. Nanda! Hurry up, we have to go to Cerveteri for the Etruscan vases! It's work that must be done at night. You're here. - There he is, the country thief. Good evening. - Evening. Who are they? Can I speak? - Yes, yes, they?re my partners. I don?t have the merchandise. - You made me come here to tell me that? You're crazy, the police pass by here. I hid it in the cemetery. Get in. - Not with the truck, you must go on foot. - Dammit! Is it far? - No, a kilometer. - Come on, let's go. How long will it take? - Half an hour we?ll be there. If someone comes, I went to see a pig, but I'll be right back. Peppino, I'm going. - You nuts? I'll be right back. Come. What is it? - Two Etruscan vases. - Whole? No, one is missing a handle. - What?s that? Nothing, an owl. - Who?s taking the risk? It's not the first time we work together, no? I don?t know you, you don?t know me... - We both go to jail. This time they?ll get us both. - Don?t worry. Keep walking. Stop it! - Owls again. Are you afraid? "Who does does no wrong, has no...nothing to fear.? A...afraid of what? Did you know? This place is full of tombs. The dead are inside, just one touch and they turn to dust. Of course, if you get murdered here, nobody would ever find out. Besides, the police pass through here every night. They shoot! Why are you looking at me? - It bothers you? - No... Is it true that you are a princess? - You think that?s funny? I?m not laughing. It could be true. It is true. Does that bother you? - No, no, on the contrary, I'm glad. No, you're not glad. You said it with such an air, as if I were crazy. No, no, by God, I'm glad. And also an educated man has said it, a professor, one who writes articles for the newspaper, who gets paid too... Could be true? It is true! He did well. You're right. And besides I... I remember it perfectly. Because I've always lived in the palace basement. And a woman had me who worked inside. Well, once the prince passed by, he took me in his arms and said, "My poor girl, my poor girl." I remember perfectly that the prince said that. They?re not back. It's late. Nanda, what shall we do? They're not back. Know what we should do instead of waiting? We?re going to look for them. Come on, walk. Nanda, don?t leave me alone. - Who?s leaving you alone? Move it! Wait! Nanda! Nanda, wait! Nanda! Oh, my God. Wait for me, Nanda! Nanda, don?t leave me alone, please! Nanda! Nanda, where are you taking me? You love your Peppino? - Yes! - Then, move it! Holy Virgin! - Follow me! Souls in purgatory, now we go down. Holy Virgin, what have I done? Nanda, wait! And now we're climbing! - We go up and down. Nanda! Nanda, don't run, please! Princess! Princess...! Princess! Wait for me! I can't do it! Wait! Nanda? Peppino! Oh, my God! Shut up, you?ll wake the dead! - Mamma mia, there are dead? Nanda! Peppino! Pepp?! Wait! Wait for me, Nanda! Nanda! Peppino! Peppino! I'm scared! Nanda! Look, I want to tell you something. Wait, I can?t take it anymore. Souls in Purgatory! Oh God, I broke a heel! Nanda! - Move it! Nanda, wait for me! Wait. Wait, Nanda! No! Nanda, I've fallen! Nanda, get me out! Nanda, help! Peppino! Nanda! Amelia! Nanda! Nanda! There she comes, and slowly, oh! Who told you to leave the truck alone? I'm here, ain?t I? Where have you been? I've been waiting for an hour. Where?s Amelia? - I didn?t see you come back... Amelia? Amelia?s already at home. I went to look for you. I said wait. I was in the cemetery, risking my life. Amelia! - Amelia... She was afraid. - Afraid? And how did she leave? She took the bus. - Are you stupid? A bus here? A motorist passed. A... One on a motorcycle... who was going to take the bus. Then she went with him. A red motorcycle. What? You seem crazy. One on a motorcycle going to take the bus? What do I know? He passed by. She said, "Can I go with you?" He said yes and she got on with him. And where did he go? - I think... that she?s not returning to Rome. - But where did she go? You know what she said? - What? She said in her village she was a lady who never went in want of anything. And that she doesn?t like Rome. Does-not-like-it! That?s why I don?t think she?s coming back. - Ingrate! It?s all your fault. I can?t believe it. Oh, God, God. - The business is done, eh? Everything went well, eh? Well, she's gone... Look what fresh air. Come on, hurry up, OK? Close the window. - Oh, God. Are the vases nice? -Yes. - You're going off the lane? I do what I want. Like that. We?ll put the jar here, and the bottles on top. So when you look, you?ll find it right away. Give me the mortar. - The mortar? Where did I put the mortar? Here it is. - Gimme it. Right before my eyes. So you can say, "Do you want to eat out, in the country, at a friend's house...?" But where will it be better than in one?s home? And maybe then there?s a desire to leave, to go for a walk, a little distraction... And then when you're tired where do you go? Home! A house full of people. If a friend comes, a relative, one is nice, treats him well, offers him something. But after a while he goes! No? A guest is like the fish, that smells bad after a while. And man has the right to enjoy his privacy. Am I wrong? Quiet, shut up, shut up, shut up. Shut up. You're always talking to yourself. Quiet. Quiet! Pepp?... Mamma mia! What the hell! - Pepp?... Oh, my eyes! What are you seeing! My saint, how they have left you! All dirty! Like a sow! Tell me who it was! They left you like St Lazarus! Pepp?! Pepp?! - Oh, God! Oh, God! Pepp?, she wanted to kill me! She threw me into a hole! She wanted to kill me! - Look what was done to you! Was it her? Bitch! Oh, my God! You're falling on me? - Pepp?! - You'll crush me! You see her? - Wicked soul! Murderess! You wanted to kill her! You deserve to be punished! She's crazy! - Calm down, you?re suffocating me! Nanda, where are you going? - See? - Oh God, the bottles. Be good, Nanda! - Peppino! - Leggo of me! Everything is OK! Leggo of me! Nanda, where are you going? - It's over! I'm going! Nanda, the license is in your name! I'm ruined! Where are you going? I'm going to my father! Hey! Where are you going? To see the prince. - You have an appointment? - Of course! It?s something very important. He knows me. What?s your name? Nanda Diotallevi. Hello? Cosimo. Listen, do you know if a Nanda Diotallevi has an appointment? Yes, the one with old clothes. What do I know? - Then I can go? - As soon as she arrives, stop her! There she is! Stop! Be still! Come here! There she is! Open up! Open up! No! Don?t put your hands on me! I'm a lady! I'm a lady! Don?t touch me! - Who wants to? I?ve an appointment with the prince. - Quiet, behave yourself! I?ve an appointment with the prince! Get off me! Scoundrels! Snobs! I tell you I have an appointment! Get off of me! Damn you, I'll have you fired! Get off me! - Now go! - Damn snobs! Shame on you! - Disgusting! Thieves! How that crazy lady made us work! - What do you earn by it? - Trash! Get out! Amelia! Amelia! Amelia, come back. Why are you leaving? Amelia! Amelia, listen, don?t go. This is a huge blow to me, Amelia. I get seizures. Amelia, why are you leaving? - I'm going. She?ll kill me. She?s already tried twice. - She won?t kill you. Listen, Amelia, come here. Don?t drive me crazy, I got a razor! - Pepp?, want me to call an ambulance? And who are you? Get outta here! Amelia! Amelia, come here! What will I do alone? Mamma mia, how beautiful! Miss... Are you from around here? Can I help you? Hurry on! I'm Pepp?. Who am I? If I'm anybody... I'm alone! I'm alone! Nanda! Go ahead, let?s go. Don?t you see the bank will do badly tonight? Bet, bet. It's bad tonight. Cheer up. Bonsoir ? tout le monde. - Thank you. Is that her? - Take it, play everything on 3. Bet. Bet, gentlemen. The game is on. Play, gentlemen. Bet. Bet. Bet, the game is on. Place your bets. Hey, will you decide? Let me think! - Why do you need to think for? But who are you? - Ah, fine! I think she?s too tall. - Are you crazy? And where can you find one smaller? She's like a mouse. OK, here's 10,000. Friday and Saturday. I'll give her back to you on Sunday. And you give me another 10000. - Once said, once done. Rien ne va plus. No more bets! - We know. - Go on. 3 odd red. - See how I won? Because I bet... Look, the game is as a game! I put it on the red and won. And now who gives you the money? He cheated me! This is cheating! Didn't you tell me to bet the red 3? - You didn?t bet! What do you mean I didn?t bet? - You're mistaken, Nanda. Come on. - This is a scam! Look, this is Riccardino. He says he likes you. Well, I don?t like him. He?s been staring at me for an hour. It's 1.30. -What are you doing? - Squat. Squat. -Why do I gotta squat? - Stand like this. - Like this. Are you a tailor? - Who's putting her in the trunk? Me or you? In the trunk? Take her to the fatty. - An American trunk, it's a game. The fatty is a joker. You get inside and you get 5000 lire. The management ...! The management ...! Silence, please! Silence I said! The management has the pleasure to introduce you to "Bear" Bruno. The management offers 25 thousand lire to anyone willing to fight with "Bear" Bruno. And I am not finished... Orangeade! The management throws in 25000 lire, which makes a total of 50 to whomever knocks him off the mat! Chicken feed! 50 cash! 50 cash! Nobody accepts the challenge? Me! Hey, me! I accept the challenge! What don?t you understand? They take it to the villa, put it in the entrance... And I?m in the trunk the whole time? - You don?t got be there all night. This is the watch, it runs. This is the flashlight, it works. At one, you get out of the trunk. You open the front door. Sparks comes in and you?re done, you go. And who's Sparks? - That one there, taking a nap. Hey, Rififi! What if Sparks doesn?t arrive on time? Hey! Here it says "New York, USA". And I don?t wanna go to America. Also, why you don?t put him in the trunk? He?s more dwarf than me! - Because he has a record. He?s afraid, you gotta go. - And I ain't afraid? No matter, 'cause your partner was given 10000 lire. And if I escape? Let's go, no escaping. Move it. - And how will I breathe? There are holes. - Shut up. - Behave. Nanda, c' mere. Where are you going? Take this. And this. Who are you bringing me? Professor! Professor, I'm here! Professor, did he hurt you? Leave him, won't you? Come on, Professor! Now you?ll see your Bear Bruno! He?ll take him apart and you too! Damn, how powerful! But who is this beggar? He disgusts me! Good! Good, Professor! Professor, Professor! It?s Nanda! Princess! - You recognize me? Remember me? I remember you too! Damn, you were great! Professor, where are you going? Will you take me with you? Will you take me with you? - Sure! Come on, let's go. But where...? - I dunno. - See where she's going! Where are you going? - I know him, he invited me! You know him, but I don?t. You stay here! Excuse me, Professor Golfiero Paganica. The lady is with me. The lady is committed to us. Come on, move it. No, I'm committed to nobody! He's got the money. Hide him! I?m free, let's go! - Him or you, I don't care! You?re gonna make me look bad before my gentleman friend. Hey, just a moment! I'd appreciate it if the lady was treated differently. If the lady wants to leave, she must... Hey! Whaddya mean? She cheated me out of 10000 lire! 10000 lire! - Ten! For so little? For freedom, one can never pay too much. - Leave off! Princess, friends await! - Come on, Professor. But who is this professor? Nanda! Come here. Don?t make me angry. Tell me something, Princess. How is Don Pietro? They won?t always be able to throw me out of the palace. There?ll come a day when I'll talk to him. And how we'll laugh, Professor! Of course, of course... Don Pietro and I are like brothers. Want to talk to him? I'll take you. They won?t let you through. There's the cook, the butler and the doorman... When can you get in? When? - You think they won?t receive me? You don?t know me! - Prosit! - Prosit! Prosit! All these kids are very nice. They've come to Rome to meet me. They?ve read my articles. They admire my style and appreciate me. Princess, I've decided to take care of you from now on. I've decided to take care of you. From now on you shouldn?t fear anything. What is your main aspiration? What do you want me to do for you? Professor... Professor... If you could make them recognize me as a princess... I'd be like a sister to you, a daughter. I?ll give you my life! But I'm not going back to Peppino! I prefer to sleep under a bridge! Don?t you have a home? One needs a home. I have a villa that will suit you fine! It is next to the river. It's not big, but it'll be fine for you. As a child I used to go there fishing with my father. It's yours! Professor, you?re kidding. Wanna dance? Yeah, come on. This is freedom, Princess. I've found it by denying everything: family, wealth, society, everything. But what are the boundaries that I should know, that should I find? I must know my boundaries. I must defend myself. - Holy Virgin! If you can help me, I'll help you, because you are a slave who has discovered freedom. Freedom! Nanda! Where are you going with that gorilla? Drunkard! - Scoundrel! Come and say it to my face! If you have any courage! Beat it, you wretch! I?ll take care of your house. But you gotta change your life. - Yes. I?ll work, and I won?t drink. And you must take care of the house. - Where's the villa? The villa, I remember, was here. But where? I swear I came last year. What month are we in? - Don?t you remember where it is? Nut, come home or I?ll leave you outside tonight! What does he want? How annoying! Pay him no mind, it?s all spite. Eat your heart out! Have you lost the house? Where is it? This is the tree! I remember it. This is the place! I remember very well. You'll see, it's not big but it's cozy. Enough for the two of us. It?s here. Here, I swear to you! I?ve been coming since I was kid. You've arrived, Professor. Come on, come on. - My hat. Are you hurt? - No, no, no. There's no villa here. - Yes, yes... You?ve been babbling for an hour. C'mon, get up. I tell you yes. The moment of decision arrives sooner or later. "Hercules at the crossroads", "Ulysses at his long voyage". Everything has an end. You understand, don?t you, Princess? Oh, no! I don't understand! Babble and more babble! Where's that villa? Have you brought me to spend the night out in the open? Let's go, get up! Professor! Hey! I'm leaving. - Go on then! Jerk! I won?t go back with you even if I die here! Think it over, Nanda! You'll regret it! Damn your villa! This deadbeat! Go on, sleep. - Think it over! ENTER I'LL BE RIGHT BACK. GOLFIERO Good morning. Is the professor inside? - Professor? No, no one. But isn?t this the professor's house? - Honestly, we don?t know. "We were in the madhouse.? ?We spoke of battles, of wars.? ?We spoke of battles, of wars.? "Suddenly, a poor woman approaches." - "Suddenly, a poor woman approaches." "Carrying a child in her arms." - Thanks. "Carrying a child in her arms." "Proud creature, I adore you,? "but I will destroy you!" We saw the door open and came in. Cavaliere Cesare Mattaroni, first actor of the itinerant theater company. My daughter. - A pleasure. - Otello rehearses. Osvaldo Capecchi... Miss Katya Pattane, the star of the company. We were waiting until sunrise. - What sunrise? This is the professor's house. Look around. Who is "the professor"? - Do you pay rent? No, no. - Well, since this is a private house, you gotta pay. So get out. - Ma?am... Get out of here. - This is crazy. Everybody leave. Clear out! Beat it! Children, let?s go! - That soup is ours! Coming into a house and putting on airs! Clear out! Clear out! And thank God the professor didn?t see you! What?s this? Morning, Sir. Morning. Ah, good morning. Looking for me? Whom do I owe the pleasure to? Cavaliere Cesare Mattaroni, director of the itinerant theater company. The young newcomer. - Charmed. What an honor, actors! Charmed. I?m the Professor Golfiero Paganica. - Charmed. Can I offer you a flower? For you too, Miss. - Thank you. And you, what do you do? I mean, what is your repertoire? Well, "The Two Orphans", "Buried Alive", "The White Sister", "The Two Sergeants"... He?s very good. - "Chained". Shakespeare? - Sometimes. - Yes, him too. We come here often because there is public attendance, you know? We have a handful of admirers... Electricity is what we lack, light. Ah, no! Don?t worry. I'll take care of that myself. Don?t worry. Good. What a nice surprise, a traveling company of actors. We'll have the honor of hosting them. There?s food and drink for everyone. - There?s soup! Special! Excuse me, that's Princess Guidobaldi. Professor, I'm here, eh? - Hey, Princess! Come, cheer up. I?ve come up here to talk to you. What am I doing here? Holy Virgin! - Be careful, if you fall you?ll break your neck. Is there something wrong? Between us? Do you want to act too? - Me? Do I look like a gypsy? No, look... Let's talk clearly. Have you been drinking? - No. Well... Just a little sip. - Then, you understand me? -Yes. Whose house is this? - Mine, of course! Oh, hello! OK, you were dead drunk last night, but you swore to me! May I die if you didn?t tell me... "The house is yours, I give it to you, I won?t drink anymore.? ?We?ll live together and I?ll start working." Did you say that or not? You remember? - I'm never as wise as when I'm drunk. What's said is said. This morning I didn?t drink. Well, just a little sip. This house is mine, at your disposal. And now I'm going to get to work. Damn, how angry this man makes me! The other was a dog but at least he knew me, we could argue! When I talk to you I seem to be in the clouds. Working? You call this work? The house full of vagabonds, he always drunk... and now we?re putting on a show! Sorry, Professor, I'm leaving. Goodbye. No, I beg you, don?t go. Why do you want to leave? No, I beg you. Look, you're a little woman made of mean calculations and you try to cling to material things. But I'm sure that in the depths of your soul, are hidden wings that beat. Maybe one day you'll learn to fly. That's why I admire you, and like you. I want to protect you. Please, don?t go. Pipes, ice cream, candy! Candy! Ice cream! ... tell me what it is that torments you and I?ll unravel it for you . Tonight I had a dream... And in the dream, I saw a horrible old woman. By God, Marta, please, don?t abandon me! I'm so afraid... Professor... Professor, don?t drink any more, you'll be sick. Professor, remember... This is the vesper bell. Go get ready, it?ll be your turn shortly. Professor, do you remember what the first actor told you? Yes... "The sound effects are very important to create the environment". I'm really scared. Ah...! Don?t worry. You?ll see what a big success you?ll be. I?m going. - Watch your head. Professor, watch out for the assault and fire to the castle. Yes, yes. And come in on time. - Yes, yes. What does he want from me? What does he want from me? He wants to destroy our hearth. And do you know why he wants to destroy it? Because he wants to put in gas! Silence! Do you know why he wants to destroy it? - Waiter! Oh, my father! You can?t defend yourself, daughter! - Here... He will return! He will return to destroy my happiness again! Dark days await you, I can feel it! And Marco, mother, what will become of him? And of my beloved son, what will become of him? We will watch over him, have no fear, my daughter, because the innocent will never suffer any harm! Oh, the young newlyweds...! Nanda! Nanda! Why do not you wear a mustache? - The chain! Put on a mustache and beard, like this... The cloak! - ...they won?t even see your face. Don't you blush for shame? And I, fool, that allowed you! Candy? Look how you?re dressed! Naked, tight fitting, without modesty... My hat! - You look like a black rat. God, not one blush! Oh the heat! Oh, God, how I burn. Nanda, you?ll destroy me. You leave me in pain. And if one day you're blessed to have kiddies, what will ya tell them? "I worked, naked, like a little black rat"... Dirty! If you come to convince me to return with you to be a servant, this time you're quite mistaken, my dear! Art has opened a path for me. And it could be that this black rat one day will become one day a great artist. Understand? Dirty! Come home, I'm desperate! Pulcinella, I'm talking to my wife. - I'm not his wife! You are all dirty! Meanwhile, let's start to prepare our meal. Quick, the water! The trumpet. The trumpet! Almighty God! Him, the Duke! Guards, return to the castle. The Count of Flambonia, my enemy, has announced himself by sight. Get the boiling oil ready and prepare the drawbridge. Go! What happened? Ah, Guendalina, I was looking for you for days! The concerns of war have not made me forget your smile. What are you saying, my lord? I say that you are beautiful, that I want you, that I love you! No, never! You reject me? Fool! You play with your life. No, leave me, you fill me with horror! Let my revenge be fulfilled! Your newborn... Here he is. Fruit of a love which has turned me mad with jealousy! Guendalina... You have stolen my peace, I?ll steal your son. Quick, throw him into the well. I told you to throw him in the well. He must be thrown in the well, eh! I have thrown him. You do it! You don?t want to, eh? You resist... You have a hard skin! He must die! Love has pushed me onto crime and it won?t be the last time. There he is... It's him. Rogue! Rogue! Go, go! - Hurry. Rogue! Take off your hat. And my face in the dust, in Duke Ambrig?'s presence? Never, eh? Love for the beautiful Guendalina has driven you mad, but I know how to return her to reason. Look how I laugh! For this you will die, damn you! Coward! You are facing the sword of the Duke of Ambrig?! With her you will die, damn you! A shot... An explosion! A shot, Master! Enough! Quiet, you dogs! Enough! Damn bastards, give me a...! That! The divine Shakespeare! "A horse! My kingdom for a horse!" "Now is the winter of our discontent,? ?made glorious summer by this sun of York!" "I played..." - Are you afraid? It's acting, eh! "To be or not to be?? ?That is the question...? ?Whether ?tis nobler in the mind to suffer the slings? ?and arrows of outrageous fortune,? ?or to take arms against a sea of troubles? ?and by opposing end them.? ?To die...no more...? My God, here he comes! Excuse me! Excuse me! Beware! ... with the helmet of Mambrino, I want to attack the mills, Because death is the only certain thing! He's crazy! He's after me! No! No! Me, drunk? Yes, I've had a little drink... But the truth... Truth is only one thing! And I want to shout it to the four winds! To the four winds! Hey! What are you doing? Where are you going with that nut? Get back home! I'm not going back with you! You?re a fool! ?That is the question...? Truth is only one thing! It is art that gives joy to life! The rest is infamy! Today, I've gone crazy! You've done with your pilgrimage, eh? Don?t always sulk with those evil eyes. Evil eyes! I who saved you from wandering... And freed you from that crazy man. One that goes around with those beards, what else can he be? A Satan! A foreign spy! You realize that? One day or another, he?ll wind up in prison. He'll be shot! You've been lucky to find your way home. Understand? This is your only home. Here is your husband. Your father. Your brother. Your mother. It's me who gives you warmth. It's me who defends you from snares. I have my faults, but who doesn?t in this world? But your Peppino loves you. You can count on your Peppino. Who?s that? - Get up. Eh? What do you want, gentlemen? - Don?t play the fool. Wait, I know nothing. The license is in her name. All this is hers. I work for her. She feeds me bread crust. She's a villain! She is responsible for everything. I don?t know anything! That's the truth. I know the license is hers. But you stole the Etruscan vases. What Etruscan vases? Oh, they told me about them. They came to the store. I threw them out. They came back. They came with 2 vases. I said, "Get out! I don't do anything illegal!" You tell them the license is in your name! Ain?t it true you?re responsible for everything? Eh, no! Eh, no! Eh! Enough! Enough! I'm not going to jail for you again! Nanda... - Come on, get going. I only did it to satisfy the greed of that slut. I'll...! Shut up! - They?re taking me to jail! They?re taking me to jail! Oh, God, I feel sick! I feel sick! You?re bringing on my epilepsy! I've always been nice to everyone and nobody ever has to me! I hid partisans! I don?t have a mother to protect me! What are we, gentlemen? We are dust! We are all brothers! Let us love! I kiss your hand! Don?t take me to jail! Don?t take me to jail! Take him away! - They?re taking me to jail! I'm feeling sick! They want me to go...! Fortun?! Damn you, I swear I'll kill you! You'll never see me again! Yes I will, Fortun?! I will! Come, walk on. Take him away! If not, I'll kill him! Princess! What happened, Princess? What's the matter, Princess? Dear! Damn it, everything happens to me! That one, a criminal... The other, crazy. Ah, the other...! Professor Paganica. - Yes. Poor thing, let him be. He's in the hospital, you know? In the hospital? - Yes. He's very sick. At San Camillo. Professor, how are you? Good... Very good, thanks. I didn?t know you were here. If I did, I would?ve come right away. What's wrong, Professor? How do you feel? I... was waiting for you. Untie me. They tied me. But I'm fine. Untie me. Let's get out of here. They tied you? What jerks! I?ll fix it. But, where have you been tied? They want me to die here. But I'm fine. Give me my clothes. Give me my clothes! Yes, Professor... Right away. I can?t waste time inside here. I have much to do. Princess, untie me! Get me out of here! Yes, Professor. But it's late. Tomorrow, eh? Tomorrow. Fine. Tomorrow... Under a tree... in Villa Borghese... I've hidden a bottle of Bordeaux. Aged. Bring it to me tomorrow. Yes... Yes, Professor. Tomorrow I?ll bring it. We're friends, eh? You and me... If you get me out of here, I'll show you so many things. Because you haven?t seen anything. You haven?t been anywhere, but... but the world... is truly beautiful. Better not make him talk. Leave. Well, tomorrow I'll be back, Professor. Now rest easy. Tomorrow I?ll return and we?ll go. Thank you, Professor. Excuse me. Princess! Princess! He's dead. He died tonight. They brought him downstairs. Go. Second door on the right, at the end of the stairs. Excuse me, are you coming here for Professor Paganica? You are Miss Nanda... Diotallevi. The professor passed away this morning. When they brought him here there was nothing left to do. I've a letter for you from the professor. Can you come with me? Guidobaldi. Come. Come... Come. Come forward. Have a seat. Listen... The professor asked me to deliver this letter. Two days ago. It was the last time I saw him. They called me. I didn?t know he was in the hospital. He left you everything he had. A little house next to the Tiber. To me? Indulge my curiosity: I'm old and could be your father. The professor too. What was Paganica to you? - I don?t know! He was a friend. But you... You knew him very well. Yes, for many years. We were distant relatives. The Marquis of Paganica, his father, was a good friend. You could say we grew up together. But he was crazy? - No. I hafta tell you the truth... I left him. I never understood him. He talked and talked... I was wrong. I would've still been wrong now that he's dead. But the other one kept saying, "What are you doing? What are you doing?? ?You have a business, a house.? ?You are the owner of the license... " The professor may have been crazy, but... he was a man. He had soul. He treated me like a lady. Because the other one has no soul! He's a pig! Excuse me. And what should I do? Tell me what I should do. I?m nobody's daughter. They tell you in the street, "Do this, do that, get in the trunk...? And one does the best he can, no? The professor was always drunk, did crazy things. Never had a dime. What could a poor wretch like me do? One tells me to say yes. And to take the cousin! And me there too! And we're there all three together like animals! Calm down, calm down... And he goes and makes me his heir. I've never told anyone... But I have often envied the professor's courage. He was the black sheep of his family. He was dead before now, but he lived as a free man. Maybe too much. The professor also asked me to take an interest in you. And he told me that you wanted to talk to me. What did you want to tell me? Me? Yes, something important. Speak. No. No, it's that... Given that I?ve been here... when I was a little girl. Here below, in the palace... Yes, yes. Well, nothing... I don?t understand. I know you. Maybe it's not true... It may not be true. Well...? Do you... recognize me? Me? No. No, eh? Look here. What? What? Didn't the professor tell you I?m the daughter? Are you the professor's daughter? No, your daughter! The prince?s! - My daughter? Long ago, I wanted to tell you... "I'm going and I will tell him." I even came once. But those jerks wouldn?t let me in. Damn them! And I... from them, I knew that I was your daughter. Could be... Could be. Well, now we'll see... When were you born? August 12, 1930. Daughter of unknown parents, NN. 1930... In 1930? Yes, Sir. - So in 1929... Now we'll see, eh? You called, Don Pietro? - Listen... Was I in Italy in 1929? No, you were in India, Don Pietro. We were in India... precisely from 1929 to 1933. No... No. I'm sorry. No? - No. I would've been very pleased. No, eh? - No. Anyway, come back sometimes. See you. Take care In India, eh? - In India. For heaven's sake! Damn it! Great! On this day of joy, oh, dukes and peers, I abdicate in favor of my daughter! The princess! Long live the princess! - Hurray! Long live the princess! - Hurray! Long live the princess! - Hurray! Hurray! English subtitles by sineintegral@KG
