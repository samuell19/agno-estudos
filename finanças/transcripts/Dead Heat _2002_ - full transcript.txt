VERY UNFORTUNATE. A TRAGEDY. BUT FRANKLY, THE GUY HAD IT COMING TO HIM IN SPADES. I MEAN, I DON'T WANT TO SPEAK ILL OF THE DEAD, BUT HE WAS THE WORST PIECE OF SHIT I EVER KNEW IN MY LIFE. HE'D KILL HIS MOTHER FOR A BUCK AND A HALF. ARE YA GETTING MY DRIFT HERE? HUH? NOW, HERE'S THE UPSIDE: YOU BOUGHT A HORSE FOR $3,000 THAT'S NOW WORTH 100 Gs, AND MAY I ADD, THAT THAT GUY FINNEGAN IS NO SLOUCH WHEN IT COMES TO JUDGING A THING WITH HOOVES. NOW, TO ME, THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW DO WE GET THE MONEY? WE NEED $100,000, AND WE GOT NO WAY OF GETTING IT, RIGHT? RIGHT. WRONG. I CAN ANSWER THAT WITH ONE WORD: THE FUCKIN' HORSE. TOP GALLANT. LISTEN, HERE'S WHAT WE DO. WE ENTER HIM IN A RACE WHERE THE WINNER'S SHARE OF THE PURSE IS $25,000. NOW, A RACE LIKE THAT IS GONNA ATTRACT SOME PRETTY DECENT HORSES. NOW, IF OUR HORSE IS RACING AGAINST THESE OSTENSIBLE SPEED DEMONS, HE'LL BE AT ABOUT 20-1, BECAUSE WHY? BECAUSE OUR HORSE HAS SHOWN NOTHING BUT A MEASLY THIRD PLACE IN THE LAST 3 YEARS. SO WHAT WE'VE GOTTA DO IS, WE GOTTA BET $4,000. THE HORSE WINS, WE PICK UP THE $25,000 PURSE, PLUS 80,000 BUCKS FROM THE BETTING WINDOW, WE'RE HOME FREE. LISTEN, PALLY, YOU LOVE THE HORSE, RIGHT? YES, I DO. YOU DON'T WANT THAT SON OF A BITCH TO HAVE HIM, RIGHT? NO. OK, LOOK. THE O'CONNOR STAKES. THE PURSE IS 27-5. WE ENTER THE HORSE, HE WINS, WE KEEP THE HORSE. WHAT IF HE LOSES? AGAINST THIS BUNCH OF GREASY NAGS? COME ON, PALLY. THIS IS OUR HORSE. YOU GOTTA HAVE SOME BELIEF HERE. NOW I THINK WE'RE GONNA NEED 6... WELL, 8 Gs. YEAH, YOU GOTTA PAY FOR THE ENTRY, THE BET, COVER THE COSTS... NOW, THAT MUCH, I CAN RAISE. WHERE? BARNES. NO, FOR GOD'S SAKE. NO, NO, NO, NO. LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN, LISTEN. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT, RIGHT? I'LL CALL HIM, I'LL ARRANGE THE WHOLE DEAL. YOU DON'T HAVE TO HAVE ANYTHING TO DO WITH IT. ALL YOU GOTTA DO IS MAKE THE PICKUP. LOOK, I--I WOULD DO IT MYSELF, BUT FRANKLY, BARNES SEES ME, HE GOES OFF THE DEEP END A LITTLE, AND WE DON'T WANT THAT. WHAT IS THE PROBLEM? LOOK, THIS IS GOOD FOR HIM. 10 GRAND TO-- HOW'D YOU GET TO 10? WELL, THERE COULD BE SOME EXTRA COSTS, BUT 10,000 MEASLY DOLLARS FOR PEACE OF MIND AND TO AVOID THOSE SHYSTER DIVORCE LAWYERS CRAWLING ALL OVER THE JOINT-- I MEAN, YOU CAN'T BEAT IT. WILL YOU STOP THAT? COME ON. IT'S NOT THAT-- IT'S NOT THAT BAD. JUST--COME ON-- YOU GOTTA-- YOU GOTTA-- CAN WE GET SOME WATER OVER HERE, PLEASE? OH, SHIT. I'LL TAKE CARE OF THIS, BABETTE. GET IN HERE. YOU ARE THE WORST KIND OF SCUM, YOU KNOW THAT? YOU COME HERE TO MY HOME? MY HOME? WHO'S HERE, IVAN? OH, IT'S, UH, IT'S NOBODY, HONEYBUN. IT'S JUST A GUY FROM THE LAWN SERVICE.
