(muffled voice recording playing) Is anyone up there? (muffled voice recording playing) (recorder clicking) (clock chiming) (gasping) (sighing) (static hissing) (ominous music) - My name is Daniel Blanch, I'm in Battsburgh, Pennsylvania and I moved into this apartment about three weeks ago. And for the past week and a half I've been hearing strange sounds coming from these wooded areas out back of my apartment building in the middle of the night. I told my girlfriend, Kate, about this two days ago and she accused me of being back on drugs before taking our daughter, Sarah, and going to stay with her mother. So I wanted to start documenting this to prove to Kate that I am not back on drugs and there's something strange going on out here in the middle of the night. So my building is right there. And, as you can see, this is where the sounds will be coming from. Now why would anyone or anything be out here at three and four in the morning making sounds? I mean, there's nothing out here except just acres and acres of woods. So for the next few nights I'm gonna set the camera up facing out of my window overnight to try to capture whatever sounds are happening out here. Just to prove to Kate that, I mean, there is something going on out here. I mean, maybe I am wasting my time, maybe it's just an animal or just, you know, branches, trees, I don't know but... I at least gotta prove to her that there are sounds happening out here and I'm not on drugs. I talked to two of the tenants in my building to see if they've heard any strange noises throughout the nights. But they both said they haven't noticed anything. But I can't be the only one hearing this. So I found a thread online about strange experiences in Pennsylvania and I described what I was experiencing and a man named George left his phone number and told me to contact him. So I'm gonna give him a call and see what he has to say, see what he may know. (phone ringing) - Hello? - Hello, is this George? - [George] It is. - Hey George, this is Dan, you left your number on that thread for me to contact you about the noises I was hearing out back of my apartment building. - [George] Oh yeah, I'm glad you called. - Thanks. I'm hoping you can help me explain whatever it is I'm hearing out there. - [George] I'm not sure if I can help but I can tell you what happened out there. - Happened? - [George] Yeah. There was a new pastor that came to Battsburgh in 1989. The Pastor Simon Marsh. He built a small church on that land behind your building he worked with the youth a lot in town. When I turned 20 in 1991, he was hosting a Halloween overnight event for the neighborhood kids at the church. At around 3:30 AM that morning, Deputy Spencer Kyle stopped at the church to check on his son. And that's when he discovered it. - Discovered it? - [George] All 12 of the remaining kids at the church were dead, their ears, eyes and tongues were missing and they were holding pieces of paper that said, "Hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil." - Oh my god. - [George] There was also some weird cartoon that was projected onto a sheet hanging from the ceiling. There was only one survivor, Pastor Simon Marsh's own two-year-old son. He was still in his crib crying. I think some family up in Gainesville adopted the boy. I never heard anything else. - So what, whatever happened to the pastor? - [George] Nobody knows. - Nobody knows? - [George] Nope. Pastor wasn't there when they found the kids. They never caught him. - How do you know all this? - [George] One of them kids was my daughter. - Oh, I'm sorry for your loss. - [George] You may be hearing some type of negative energy coming from that land behind your building. Hope this helps in your search. Goodnight now. - Okay. Thank you for your time! (beeping) So it is 11:45 and I'm about to go to sleep so I'm gonna set the camera up facing out of the window for the first night tonight and see what kind of sounds we capture. (crickets chirping) (thunking) (thunking) (yelling) (twigs snapping) (screaming) (door slamming) So I just finished watching the footage from last night and it sounded like the noises were closer than before. It almost sounded like kids screaming or like yelling? I'm gonna do some research on the land out there to see if I can find any information that proves I'm not just hearing make believe sounds in the woods. So I just found this article online that explains exactly what that guy George was saying. (phone ringing) Hello? - [Kate] Hey. - Hey. - [Kate] What are you doing? - Nothing, just got out of the shower. - [Kate] Did Sarah leave her favorite doll there? - Yeah, I think so, let me see. - [Kate] She can't find it. - Yeah, it's right here. - [Kate] Okay. - Why don't you come over, we can talk? - [Kate] Dan, we've gone through this before and I'm not going through it again. - Kate, I'm not on drugs! - [Kate] I've heard that before too. - There's some strange noises happening out back and I wanna find out what it is. What's the big deal? - [Kate] It's not a big deal, Dan. But with your past it is. - Kate, I've been doing some research on the area out there and I think something supernatural could even be happening. - [Kate] Supernatural? God, call me when you stop hearing noises in the woods. - Kate, Kate! (phone beeping) I couldn't find any more information on the incident at the church to see if the church is still out here or if it was tore down. I'm gonna prove to you, Kate, that I'm not on drugs. There is something strange going on out here and this church could have something to do with it. Wonder how far these woods go. So I've been out here for about two hours and I just came across this patch of land and it's all burnt. I don't know if maybe this is where the church was at one point and the locals burned it down after the incident. But something was definitely here that was burned down. I'm gonna start heading back before it starts getting dark. So I just returned to my apartment and this is how the door was when I came up. Halfway pried open. I already checked all the rooms and nobody's in here. (vomiting) I don't know... I don't know what came over me. I was feeling really dizzy, really sick. I'm gonna, I gonna head to bed, I'm gonna set the camera up again tonight, I'm actually, I'm gonna set like an alarm system tonight. I'm gonna put this alarm underneath my front door tonight just because I'm feeling a little uneasy with coming home and the front door being wide open like that. (crickets chirping) (twigs snapping) (barking) (twigs snapping) (growling) (whimpering) (alarm blaring) Who's out there? Kate? Is that you? (alarm blaring) (gasping) What the fuck? Hi, yeah, I think someone just broke into my apartment. My front door was wide open and my alarm system was going off. The Blair Apartments, 5000 Haddon Street. I don't think so. - [Girl] Dada! (gasping) - [Dan] Sarah? Sarah? Sarah, is that you? - [Sarah] Daddy. I found who's making those sounds. - [Dan] Stay right there, baby, I'm coming! Where's the flashlight? Sarah? Where are you, baby? I can't see you. Sarah! I can't see shit. (thunking) (yelling) (bell tolling) What the fuck? Sarah? (creaking) (creaking) Sarah? (twigs snapping) (vomiting) (coughing) (bell tolling) (leaves rustling) Who's there? (giggling) Sarah? - [Sarah] Dada! - [Dan] Sarah? (gasping) (thudding) Come on. Ah shit. Fuck. (ominous music) (beeping) Sarah? Where'd you go? (gasping) The church. What the fuck? (bell tolling) - Dada! - Sarah? Hold on, baby! Hold on, baby, I'm coming. (groaning) (twigs snapping) Hold on, baby, I'm coming. (thudding) (gasping) Sarah? (doorknob rattling) (gasping) Sarah? (giggling) (running footsteps) (ominous music) (gasping) Kate? (clattering) What the fuck? Kate? (whimsical music) What the fuck? Sarah? Kate? Fuck this. (gasping) Who are you, where's Sarah? - You mean my granddaughter? - [Dan] What, what does that mean? - Do you even remember this place? - [Dan] You're Pastor Simon Marsh. - I left you here that night because you weren't ready. - What? - But now we finish your prayer service. (screaming) (groaning) - [Pastor] I've been waiting for you, my son. Do you even remember that night? (groaning) Perhaps you were too young to understand our sacrifice. (laughing) And tonight, you will! (thudding) (groaning) We have made our sacrifice and we have finished our prophecy. We are now all together again.
