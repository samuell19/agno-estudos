- Subtitles - Lu?s Filipe Bernardes Come on, old boy, up and at 'em. - Stevie. - I'm awake, Ma, I'm awake. Now don't give me that old routine about I'm just resting my eyes. I've already cheated enough for both of us. I set the alarm clock ahead 15 minutes last night. Oh, it's laundry day, so don't put your pajamas under the pillow, hm? And also it's cold outside, so you might as well wear your red sweater. Since you're wearing a sweater, you can wear a white shirt underneath. And your brown slacks I think would do. And that new bow tie of yours... What, again? I thought we weren't going to play fireman anymore. - Hope you've drawn clean underwear. - I did everything, see? Let me see. Pretty good. Let me see your nails. Yeah. Yeah, you did do everything, didn't you? - No, Ma, no, you mustn't! - Mustn't what? Do things like this anymore. I mean, you can't do the hard things, like making up my bed. Oh, honey, no wait a minute. It's alright, Ma. Dad explained how you change and everything. We had a big discussion. Really? When? Sometimes when he comes in late at night, I wake up and... Yeah, yeah, you wake up and what? - And we have discussions. - Oh, about me? About your condition. And now we decided it's time for you to do just the easy jobs. And Dad said for me to be sure to take your arm when we're crossing streets. And when we're riding the subway, to be sure people don't bump into you. Oh, I think that's very sweet of you and Daddy, Steve. But tell me, just what do you consider an easy job, hm? You can dress yourself. Two against one is no fair. You know, what I need around here is a... Another woman on my side. You'll get one. Dad and me decided that too. It's gonna be a girl. Oh... well, that'll be very nice. Um, honey. At your next meeting, I wish you and your dad would make another decision, and a very important one. Where are we going to put little sister. Sure, Mom. - Mom. - Yeah? Dad ought to get a job on the evening paper. Then he could go to work in the morning like other people. Oh, honey, he's wanted to for years. Here, finish your milk. But he never will. You know. A newspaperman's always gonna do something about it tomorrow. - Eight-thirty, Ma. - All right, I'll hurry up. Or I'll be late for work and you'll be late for school again. Where's Daddy's note? - Here. - Good. Dear Bob, Bring home lima beans, paper towels and two kisses, strong enough to wake me up. - I don't get it. - Well... I'm surprised, after all those conferences? Put it there. Come on. Good morning, Joe. Mrs. MacAvoy, the new Editor and Publisher just came in, - You want me to hold one for the mister? - No, no, I'll give it to him. And charge him. Um... Excuse me. Excuse me. Bob... Sweetheart. - Angel... - Bye-bye, darling, see you after work. I'm not going to work today. Or any day. - I've just quit my job. - That's wonderful. Let's both go back to sleep. No, darling... Darling, wake up, will you? Come on, wake up. I want you to see an ad. It's something that you've always wanted. Now just listen to this. For sale. A newspaperman's dream come true. Far from the hectic bustle of the city and... - Bob MacAvoy, you pay attention to me. - I am, honest I am. Okay. - Now, are you awake? - Yeah! All right, now listen to this. There's a country newspaper for sale in California. A little town called Eden. And, Bob, it sounds like an absolute paradise. And seven spacious rooms to live in. It's right there, seven spacious rooms. And, oh, darling, what's most important is... ...you can do what you've always wanted to do. Just exactly as you wanted to do. We've got to do something right now about it, Bob. - Right now. - And what do we use for money? Well, they only want twenty-five hundred dollars down. What'll we use for the twenty-five hundred down? I've been working. And you made me promise not to spend the money on Steve or my... Now wait. That money is our in-case money. In case anything happens, that's your security. Oh, darling, you're my security. Baby, that's a really awfully sweet thing to say, but... Oh, Please, can't you see this is our one chance to get out of this rot? Out of these daily separations. And just think of it, no more note-writing. - Yeah, but, darling, I can't... - What's happened to all our wonderful plans? You were going to run your own newspaper... ...with all those new wonderful ideas you were saving up. Oh, dear, please, here it is. Here it is, right here, with bells on it. Darling, we'll talk about it tomorrow. No, we won't. Tomorrow will be too late. Let's talk about it right now. I've been getting better assignments on the newspaper. Just last night I had a story... Where's the paper? I saw the paper. And nine lines on page 1. - Nine? - Yeah, hm-hm. Ah, what's the use? - But you know we'd have to buy a car. - Yes, we would, wouldn't we? Circulation... 2,653. That's not bad. I'll make us some ham and eggs, huh? - I wonder which one is ours. - I tell you I'd settle for any one of them. So would I. Seven spacious rooms. And the yard's wonderful. All those real houses out there, grass... No TV aerials. You know, maybe that's good. Maybe that'll mean more advertising for the paper. What do you suppose happened after they took the picture? Well, offhand I'd say a couple of historical events, including the assassination of Lincoln. Well, as I always say... What is it I say in a situation like this? - Never judge a book by its cover? - That's right. Come on. - What's inside is more important. - Yeah. Attaboy. There you go. Wait a minute, both of you. But really, I can manage all right. Thank you. Grab my coat, will you Stevie, and don't drag it on the ground. Newspaperman's dream come true, huh? You didn't really buy it, did you, Daddy? Yep. What's that real estate man's name, the one we sent the check to? - Fred Hawley. - I'm gonna kill him. Oh, darling, I really didn't mean that, honestly. Why not? You'd just save me the trouble, that's all. - Hello! - I give up, I give up. That blasted infernal machine. Be with you folks in a minute. Nellie. Jake Armstrong, down at the Archive. Get 239J for me, will you? Concerned, miss? I aint seen nothing like it since Grandmother... That you, Homer? Better get over here again. She's spitting ink like a scared octopus. Hurry on over. Man and boy, I've worked around newspapers all my life, but this is the most contrary, the most miserable... Good morning, my name is... You'd better write it down, I ain't got no more memory for names than a flea. Let's see... Now, them there's the blanks if you wanna subscribe and um... And there's the blanks if you want to take an ad. But I ain't garanteeing there'll be a paper this week, Oh, why not? Busted press. Darndest thing you ever saw. It threw page four clear across the shop and spat ink right in Matthew's face. Is that serious? Oh, it's none of my worries. Some clunkhead's gone and bought the outfit. From now on it's his headache. Well, what can I do for you, folks? Have you got an aspirin? - You ain't... - Oh, yes, yes, this is Mr. MacAvoy. - The new owner. - The clunkhead. Yes, I'm Mrs. Clunkhead. Well, like I say, some days it don't even pay to get up. - This is Stevie. - Hello, Stevie. - I'm Jake Armstrong. - How do you do? - Happy to meet you. - Thank you. Well, I guess you folks will want to look her over. - Yes, we would very much. - This here's the office. Oh? Be careful, ma'am, this pressroom's pretty dirty. - Thank you. - Matthew! Matt runs the linotype. Hello, Matthew. - I don't recall seeing you before. - No, you haven't. - Huh? - I said you haven't. - Well, how'd you know my name? - Matthew. This is Mrs. MacAvoy. Her husband Bob here is the new owner. Oh, no. And such nice folks. Well, anyway, the linotype seems to be in pretty good shape. Yeah, yeah... She drops Os instead of Is and sometimes generally late at night she lisps. She'll give you a TH when you want an S. - Oh. - Great. A lisping linotype and a busted press. Breaks down the same way every week. Press day. Well, how do you print the paper? It's a miracle how we print this paper, but we do it. Every Thursday there she is being delivered. Oh, all 2,653 copies, hm? What? - What's funny? - That was the circulation fifty years ago. I know how you feel, son. Who ever talked you into taking over this mess? How do you do, Mr. MacAvoy? I'm Fred Hawley. That's the man you said you'd kill. Mr. Hawley, how could you do this to us? We believed your ad. We believed it so much that we sold or pawned everything we had... ...in order to buy this newspaper. You ought to be ashamed of yourself. Mrs. MacAvoy, it... Mrs. MacAvoy, that old picture of the Archive was the only one we had. - I sent it out deliberately. - But why? Well, I wanted to attract someone like you. I believe in Eden, Mr. MacAvoy. And I think there's a great future here for an editor who believes in it. It'll take time, it'll take a lot of work, but look what the mere announcement of a new editor has brought in already. These are ads of welcome to you. - How many? - Well, there's only five here, but... - It just goes to show. - Show what? The town needs a newspaper, it wants a newspaper. If you're enterprising, this town will get behind you. - What do you think, darling? - Well, you heard the man, dear, the town's gonna get behind you. Well, I'd better get those ads started. Jake, I'd like to try a little something different here. You know, this place may be old and broken down, but... suddenly there's something rather exciting about it. Maybe there's some of the printer's ink in my... Mr. Hawley. Mr. Hawley, about our home. - Home? - You know, the seven spacious rooms? Oh, yes, Mrs. MacAvoy. Well, I'd like to go there right down there if you don't mind. - Certainly, I'll take you right up. - Thank you. Wait a minute, did you say up? Convenient. A seven-room apartment right up those stairs. - An apartment? - Place to give you a little income too. Jake and Matthew rent two of the bedrooms. Mr. Hawley... Hello, pretty. Is the new editor here yet? He's pretty busy now, Eve. This is his wife, Mrs. MacAvoy. This is Mrs. Spatch, the Stimpson Crossing correspondent. - Oh, how do you do, Mrs. Spatch? - How do you do? I've got a scoop. Jake! Stop the press. You shut up, Eve, you old mule. You know that thing breaks down every press day. Now looka here who you're talking to, young man. Mrs. Spatch, what is your scoop? Aggie Lundgren has finally made up her mind to marry that sailor chap in San Francisco. And if that ain't a scoop, I don't know what is. Of course, Aggie's ma gave me all the dope. Did you write it all down? Oh, no, I want the new editor to do that. I want a real nice story on the front page. Those Lundgrens are good neighbors. Well, um, perhaps I can help you. Can you write a real nice story? I think I can manage a little social item like this. Oh, yes, and before I forget it, I want to tell you about the bridesmaids' dresses. - Oh, yes... - They're to be made of tulle. Oh, and they're going to be cut way out wide like that. The tops are going to be sort of little jackets. And they're all in different colors, just like a rainbow. Oh, that will be lovely. Now, um... whar are the names of the bridesmaids? Oh, now... now you got me again. I think I'd better call up Aggie's ma and let you talk to her. Yes. I'll line up that ad for the market. I'm gonna make that one column, instead of two. Nellie? We gotta stick to local news. If nobody falls in a well or gets the mumps or dents a fender, we don't sell papers. I see. All a body can do is pray for a nice fire and an explosion. - Bob! - Hm? I have a headline for your first edition. Poor child! I just saw it was about your time. Well don't just stand there. Somebody call up Doc Powers. Come on, we gotta get you right upstairs. Jane, Jane, darling, why didn't you say something? - I did. - You just gonna sit there at a time like this? - We got to get her upstairs. - Please, just a minute. - I just want to sit down a minute. - Isn't anyone going to get a doctor? I will, I'll get a doctor. Say, tell Nellie to call the Kosinov Cafe first. The doc's usually there at this time of day. Is she b-b-b-baby? She's going to have a baby. Stand back everybody. I don't know anything about a call to Aggie Lundgren. Get me Doc Powers! Do you think you can make it upstairs now, dear? I don't understand why you want to take her upstairs. What's up there? - Seven spacious rooms. - Oh, no! No! - What we need is a hospital. - No time, the nearest one's 40 miles. - Got her bed made up? - Yeah... no, no. Well make it! See, I told you last Tuesday! You should have taken care of it. Doc's on his way. What can we do? Do you want a police escort to the hospital? Bet you thought I'd never get here. I come as fast as I could. - I had some other calls. - She's right here. She's where? Behind all those people. I'll carry her upstairs for you. You'll carry her? Say, who do you think you are? I'm Bob MacAvoy, her husband. Aren't you the doctor? Doctor? I come to fix the press. Excuse me, please. Can I... can I get in there? Where's MacAvoy? Mr. MacAvoy, you better help her upstairs. That's just what I'm trying to do. Now careful, watch it... watch these steps. Wait a minute! Wait a... wait a minute, I tell you she's not here! This time everybody stand back! - Darling, come on. - Yeah... - Darling. - Come on in. Aren't her ears just beautiful? Isn't she the most perfect thing you ever saw? You're famous. Why, darling, you're wonderful. Getting your first edition out on a day like this, It's not out yet. This is just a proof. Homer's still down there wrestling with the press, but we're ready to go the minute it starts working. But don't forget, Aggie Lundgren's wedding has to be on the front page. - Oh, it's here, Mrs. Spatch all right. - Oh, good. I wrote about twenty other stories on local events. It's all right, honey, sit down. I compiled the club notes, church news, and I wrote me my first editorial. Read it to me. - I called it "Strictly Personal". - Oh, that's nice. "It is not an uncommon trait for men to consider themselves superior to women. Equality of the sexes may be recognized by law, but few men recognize it without reservation. A woman who is really man's intellectual superior never lets on. In fact, she encourages a man's conceit." Excuse me. I, um, I just fixed this up for a crib. - Why, Mrs. Spatch, that's darling. - Yes, it'll do alright for now. Well, I'll be out in the kitchen if you want anything. Oh, I brought you some soup and... oh, stuff. Didn't want you to go hungry. I think I'll just stick around till Doc Powers gets back. - Mrs. Spatch. - Hm? I don't know what I'd have done without you. Oh, child. You see, the trouble with you is you were raised in a big city. If you wanted something, you just called up and got it. Well, round here there are not so many of us. So, whoever can does. Why don't you leave her alone? "Two weeks ago, Jane, my wife, encouraged me to buy this newspaper. We arrived in Eden a few hours ago. Since then, she has boosted the morale of her husband, taken on two boarders..." Oh, my goodness. I guess I can't take this for a shortcut any more. You see, my bedroom is there and the bathroom is over there and... I ususally go... - Excuse me. - Yes. I like him. Go on, dear. Um, "...taken on two boarders, scooped the world on announcing Aggie Lundgren's plans to marry her sailor boy, and delivered a beautiful addition to our family. A baby girl. Now I ask you, what me, a male, can equal that record of production? I am proud to have her name on the masthead of this paper... and want you all to know that the editorial "we" of the Archive... ...will in fact be us." Bob, it's just beautiful. What's that? Bob! The press! The press is working! Darling, we're going to have a newspaper after all! Never mind, Sister, we'll just have to get used to it. This is probably what happens every Thursday. James, Steve, Sister and myself are not really horses, though we work as such to make the paper happen every Thursday. Very funny young fellow that MacAvoy. - Well, aren't you gonna buy it? - What for, I already read it. Oh, and our Lady's Aid is planning a covered-dish supper and bazaar next Friday. - I can promise you front page. - Oh, well that will be nice. Oh, by the way, you and Mr. MacAvoy must come. Thank you. And I want to thank you for something too. You know that little story I told you about Mrs. Ford's first husband. Oh, I was scared to death you were going to print it. Oh, not a chance. I knew you just lost your temper. My wife talks too much. Don't ever publish anything she says. Mt. Peterson, there is something I would like to publish. How about advertising some of these wonderful bargains I just bought? Why not let the Archive tell of Eden about your unusually low prices? Oh, it's bound to bring results. But how can I get results? An ad in a newspaper that nobody reads. Well, more and more people are reading the Archive every week. Why, we brought the circulation up to 700, 703 to be exact. Well, when you bring it up to 1,703, Mrs. MacAvoy, then you came back and see me about an ad. All right, Mr. Peterson. I just happened to be passing your hardware store last night, Mr. Brown, I saw that terrific special that you've got on garden tools. I know that the Archive could sell every one of those things overnight. I've drawn up a little ad I'd like to show you. Yeah, ad. All right. Thank you anyway, Mr. Brown. Thank you. It's all right. May I help you? - Oh, yes, Mr. Trout? - That's me. Oh, well, I'm Jane Archive... I mean I'm Jane MacAvoy from the Archive, and I want to ride a story about your New York Trip. - You do? - Yes. Well, let's go some place for lunch and I'll tell you all about it. Thank you very much, but I haven't time today. - What's the hurry? - Well, I have a deadline, Mr. Trout. No, I actually mean about lunch. Well, frankly, I have another luncheon date, you see? Oh, then you do accept an occasional invitation. Oh, certainly. - Well, um... about the Myron Trout story. - Yes. To tell you the truth, I don't care much for New Yorkers. - They're always pushing and shoving. - Oh. - But that show at the Copa. - Oh, Copacabana? - Yeah, that big nightclub. - Oh, yes. - The floor show, wow, I saw it three times. - Indeed? You'd think I was buying for Sears Roebuck the way I got around. You're not going to print that in your the paper... my wife. Oh. You know, it's murder the way those manufacturers keep us up all night... ...just to sell us a few pair of socks. I understand, Mr. Trout. Um, Myron Trout, Eden's popular haberdasher, returned recently from an exhausting and arduous business trip to New York City, hm? Now, of course, this would just be the caption under your picture. - My picture? - Yes. And, since we're making a cut, we might as well make it two prints. One for the front page, and one for your ad. What ad? Oh, naturally you'd want to take an ad in the new Archive... ... like so many of the other businessmen are doing? Now tell me, would you prefer a one-column ad or would you care for two columns? Well, um... what would you say if I took half page? Why, Mr. Trout, I'd say you are a very smart young businessman, which apparently you are. Now, about the copy, what do you want to say? I'll, um... leave that to you. Oh... fine. I'll make up the layout and bring it over this afternoon. Shall we say about 5:30? Yes, yes, I think I can have the proof ready by then. Goodbye. My luncheon date. I'll see you later. Jake, stop the press! I said stop the press! I just landed a half-page ad. You've got to be fooling. Half a page, you're not kidding? Not at all. You think I'd stop this thing for laughs? - Who's the ad for? - Myron trout at the men's shop. Trout? He ain't never advertised before. Oh, things are going to be different from now on, Jake. Oh, the old boy made a play for you, eh? Boy, three forward passes, and by the way, he's not old. What did he do, did he chase you around the necktie counter? - No, he asked me to lunch. - Oh, why didn't you go? Oh, I'm meeting him later, 5:30... ...with the layout. So whip me up something to show him, will you? Also, I promised him a small item on the front page about his shop. Item? We'll give him a lead story. How wonderful Jake sounds silent, huh? First time a woman ever got the best of that Trout. Where does the Casanova stay in New York? Hey, why don't we put his picture on the front page too? I told him we would. Jake, you got any old cuts and pictures of Myron Trout? We got a picture of him on a bearskin rug some place. Guess we'd better look in the morgue. Didn't know we had a morgue, Jake. Yeah, it's under Sister. Remember we used them old pictures to make a matress. Heavens above! Hear, dear. There you go. Here. Look at that... yes, look at that. Eden Archive. Oh, hello, Mr. Trout. Yes... I'm glad you called, um... Bob MacAvoy, the new editor. Yeah, Jane MacAvoy's, husband. Now, Mr. Trout... Mr. Trout, you need that ad... Mr. Trout, you... - Goodbye, Mr. Trout. - Why, that stinker! Oh, come on, Bob, his ad isn't that important. Darling, no one ad is that important, it's all the ads we don't get. And the subscriptions. Jane, Jane... We've been here two months now and look at us, look at the way we all work. It's bad enough not being able to earn a living, we can't even lead normal lives. We've never led normal lives. Now take it easy, you two. Remember what you were trying to prove when you took over the Eden Archive. We've proved it, we don't belong here. I'm afraid we belong back in New York. Oh, darling. We are not going back to New York. Darling, 703 paid subscriptions we're lucky if we'll meet the payroll this week. - I know dear, but we're still not... - Here it is. Oh... Oh! If a picture of Myron Trout on a bearskin rug'll cheer you up, there it is. I ain't so sure that's Myron Trout. Hey, Matthew. Yeah. Take a gander at this picture. I ain't so sure. Is that Myron Trout when he was a little baby... ...or is it George Wilkins when he was? Peterson's oldest boy. No, that's either Myron Trout or George Wilkins. - Peterson's oldest boy. - I'm inclined to think it's George Wilson. - Peterson's oldest boy. - You're both wrong, it's Susie Withers aged 6 months. Jake, Matthew. Can you identify any of these old pictures? Now wait a minute, wait a minute. How about that one? My goodness, that's the house I was born in. - No, that's the old slaughterhouse. - Just a minute. No, you're both wrong. It's the Eden High School. Mystery pictures, huh? - "What is it?" - "Who is it?" Can you identify the old picture in this week's Archive? And the first five people who can win free subscriptions. Wait, it's Isabel Sanders. No, it couldn't be, but she looks so familiar. Let me see that, let me see it! - Why, that's me! - My, really? - Yes, it's me when I was six! - Are you sure? Nell, give me the Archive. Here you are, Mr. Peterson. Have you got another picture this week, Steve? Sure have. Mystery Picture number 2. Oh, Steve, just a minute. You better get me five more papers, dear. - Hi, Fred. - Hello, Janie. - Good morning, Mr.Sweetzer. Five? - Better make it ten, Mrs. MacAvoy. This who-is-it game of yours is getting to be the highlight of the week around here. Good! This week it's "What is it?" - Oh? I was going to pay for it. Better get it this time. Almost had a winner last week. Isn't it beautiful? So grand and proud-looking. I'd love to have a house like that. Excuse me, Mrs. MacAvoy. Oh, my, I've got to make up 210. Mr. Sweetzer, I... - Fred. - Yeah? - Fred, what's wrong? - What's wrong with what, Janie? They took just one look at the Archive and just ran. What is it? - Is Bob in the office? - Yeah. Excuse me, Janie. - Fred, I... - I'll be right back. - But... - Oh, Mrs. MacAvoy, I simply adore that strictly personal column your husband's writing. Boy! Friend, baby, do you know what you've done? With that picture on the front page you're gonna be swimming in cancellations. Do you know what that is? Sure, it's the old George Weatherfield mansion, at least it's what it says in the back of the photograph. That's correct. Only we don't call it the George Weatherfield mansion anymore. He died a few years ago and he willed it to an old friend of his in Seattle. A Mrs. Lucinda Holmes. Well... Mrs. Holmes showed up and took over in a big way. And ever since then, some of our citizens have regarded her... ...as the serpent in our little garden of Eden. They tried to get rid of her, but she wouldn't budge. Why should she, it's her home, isn't it? Well, you see, son, it isn't exactly a home anymore. Lucy has made it into a... Well, an inn, you know... where a fellow can take a lady... ...and be sure that his wife doesn't know about it. You know, for a few drinks, and dining, and... dancing and... - You mean... - Uh-huh. Oh, no, oh, brother... - Bob. - Yeah, what? Bob, what's the matter with the Archive this week? Everyone's acting so strangely, and even you, Fred. Now what... I'm very sorry, Jane, excuse me, I have to get back to the office. Bob will yell you what it's all about. - Bob, what is it? - Darling, darling, sit down. Yeah? - Baby, just imagine... Well, why didn't Jake or Matthew tell us? Honey, those two boys lead very sheltered lives. Where's the editor of this bean-billed bugle? - Right here. - Well, I'm Mrs. Lucinda Holmes. H-How do you do, Mrs. Holmes? I'm Mrs. MacAvoy and this is my husband Bob. Won't you come in? What happened to the old goat who used to run this paper? - Died. - He was dead when he ran it. That's a smart little dress, Mrs. MacAvoy, where did you get it? Uh... in New York. - You look like a regular guy. - Why, thank you. So what's your case against me? Well, Mrs. Holmes... And what's the big idea of putting this on your front page? Well, Mrs. Holmes, we didn't realize when we published it that... - Didn't realize what? - Well... Mrs. Holmes, we didn't know that, um... ...it wasn't still the Weatherfield Mansion and that you don't like publicity. Oh, what's that? Oh, that's just Sister, she's hungry. - Come on, darling, I know you're hungry. - Aw, isn't she cute? Of vourse she's cute. There we go. Next week's issue? Where do the rest of you sleep, in the desk? Well look, we didn't mean to offend anybody when we published that picture. Hello... hello? You folks losing business on account of me? On account of the picture. Same thing. Look. I'll take a subscription. And while I'm at it, I'll take an ad. So write something good and snappy about the San Fernando Serenaders That's the new three-piece band I got coming in on Saturday. Well, I guess not. That would close you up for sure. Mrs. Holmes, would you consider taking an ad for someone else? - Someone else? - Yeah, wait just a minute. There, there it is. Lady's Aid covered-dish supper and bazaar. Oh, they're trying so hard to raise money for a new orphanage. And they really need the publicity. All right, I'll do it. For the Lady's Aid, I'll go for a full page. Oh, that's wonderful. Say, how would you like me to send the San Fernando Serenaders... ...down to play for them too? - Mr. MacAvoy. - Yes. We represent the Women's Auxiliary of the Better Eden Club. This is the complete list of our members. We would all like our subscriptions terminated at once. The minutes of our last meeting for your next edition. And be sure you put it on the front page. And this time please don't mispell my name. It's Dow, with a d, not a c. The outcasts of Eden. Why don't we have a contest? Darling, what do you call what just flopped? Oh, no, no, dear, I mean a real contest. Why don't we give away something free? Give away a free chance with every subscription on, um... - Well, dishes or something. - Dishes? Dishes? Why not give away a car? - Are you kidding? - What car? Any car, a brand new one. If you're going to do something, do it big. Make the prize worthwhile. After all, you almost gave me away. I've got a hundred new subscriptions. What have you got? Twenty-nine renewals. Oh, gee. Maybe we should have stuck to dishes, hm? The trouble with you kids is you don't get out and meet the people. We don't huh? How would you like to come pounding pavements with Sister and me tomorrow morning? I mean you don't meet them socially. If you want to promote a contest like this, you've got to make yourself popular. Meet wives, meet families, join their clubs, attend their meetings, go to their parties. Fred, we haven't got the time. Jane and I hardly see each other now. No, he's right, Fred. Anyway, I think it's kind of cheating to... well, suddenly become a joiner just because we're... we're running a contest. Well, what about the merchants and professional men around here? You don't think what they're doing is cheating, do you? Oh, no, no, of course not. They join clubs because it's good for their business. Oh... well, if it's good for business... Darling, let's cheat a little, hm? Ooh... First thing I'm going to do is make you a member of the JC. Hello, Nellie. Give me 945J. Honey, what's the JC, what's he talking about? Twenty-five dollars, Mr. Jones. Twenty-five dollars, thank you, Mr. Jones. Mr. Bob MacAvoy. He ought to make quite a donation, and you know why. He's the one who's gonna give away the new car. Well, all I've got is the grocery money. Seven dollars. Oh, I'm glad you finally got here. I'm so sorry I' late, Mrs. Brown, but... Mr. MacAvoy didn't get back from his meeting till about twenty minutes ago... ...and I'll have to check some copy with him. - Well, you'd better hurry on, darling. - Yes, I... Oh, I see that our guest speaker has arrived. If you'll just step down here, Mrs. MacAvoy. I'm all right, I'm all right, thank you. As the newest member of the literary club, I've been tempted to tell you about the first book I ever read. Thank you. As the newest member of the Eden Elementary parent teacher's association... ...I would like to congratulate you on the wonderful job I think you've been doing... - Hi, Stevie! - Hi, Mom! Hi, kids. Humphrey here says his mother is going to buy a subscription. Well, hooray for Humphrey. I'll drop you by it's also on our way home. Go ahead, fellows, get in the car. And Stevie, look out for Sister. - Okay! - Let's go, Steve! Mr. Bartlett, I'm Jane MacAvoy of the Archive, Stevie's mother. I think it's wonderful that you're helping these kids with their 4-H work. Well, 4-H is good work, right now I got plenty of time for it. Um, Mr. Bartlett, did, um did Stevie tell you about our wonderful contest? Yes, yes, he did. Well, did he tell you that with each new subscription... ...we're giving away a free chance on a new automobile? Waste of time trying to sell me a subscription. Oh, I could use a new car alright. But if you were selling chances on a good long rainfall, I might be interested. You mean to water your crops? Well, why don't you irrigate? With what? Don't you know how long it's been since we've had rain? Three months. Wait a minute. You wouldn't take that to be wheat, now, would you? Oh, I'm sorry, Mr. Bartlett. We've just been so... ...busy trying to get people interested in the Archive I just didn't realize. That's a fine thing for the wife of the editor to admit, isn't it? Well, if you want to be blunt about it, it is. Here us farmers are suffering from drought... and all you read in the Archive is what kind of ice-cream and cake... ...some old lady served to a lot of other old ladies. Well, I just ain't interested. Jake, I... Oh, no, not again. Press day, Mrs. Jane. Oh, yeah... All ri... Hey! Jane, Jane, darling! Oh, my, it's nice to see you. You're looking very well these days. And you look just beautiful. Oh, I don't, I'm tired, I'm hot, but I'm glad you think I look beautiful. Oh, let me look at you. Did you come back from the Air Force? Hm? Oh, it's my scout master's uniform, didn't you get my note about it? Yes, dear, I did, I'm sorry, I forgot about it. - Oh, gotta run. - Bob, wait a minute! You can't go yet. There's a story you've got to write, about the drought. I haven't got the time. What drought? That's what I said too, what drought? And it's something we should have been reporting on our front page for months now. Okay, you write a story. No, honey, it shouldn't be a story, it should be an editorial. Darling, I've already written an editorial for this week, it's about the contest. Well, since the press has broken down, we can change it. Anyway, this is more important than the contest. Honey, there's nothing more important than this contest, believe me. Rain is for those farmers. An editorial on the Archive isn't going to bring rain. Yes, but it might start the people even praying for it, hm? Okay, okay, okay, I'll right a new editorial. All right, darling. And listen, on your way back will you bring some rye bread and um, wait a minute... paper clips and stop-red lipstick, huh? Rye bread, paper clips, stop-red lipstick. Should make a very interesting sandwich. - I love you. - Scout's honor? Scout's honor. - You ought to give Mr. Dow a raincoat. - He already has one. What do you mean a raincoat? Well, I declare. All you got to do to make it rain, so he says, is to have an airplane, some dry ice, and of course the proper cloud formation. You mean that editor's really going to make it rain? Is he really going to give away an automobile? Certainly. That is, everybody says so. Isn't he? All I know is they walk in here from New York, so they say, to set up shop. The next thing you know they're promoting all kinds of fancy contests. - Mr. Trout, are you inferring... - To each his own opinion, Mrs. Dow. Personally, I'd be suspicious of any man... ...who'd let his wife pose as a single woman to solicit advertising from another man - You mean that... that Jane MacAvoy... - I'm not mentioning any names. Well, I'm not afraid to mention names and I won't mispell them either. Hope Mr. Dow likes his tie. Well, gentlemen, we have an even 100 renewals. And 406 new subscriptions and a cash total of $1,265. - Is that good? - Huh? Oh, I think so, son. How are we supposed to pay for that car we're going to give away? You know, some people don't think we're really gonna give away an automobile. - Who doesn't think so? - Don't you pay any attention to them. Now wait a minute, dear, with a contest going like this we've got to pay attention. Bob, you take this money and go and make a downpayment on this car right now. And we'll get it on display as quickly as possible. Archive. No, no, this is not the Acme Ice Company. - It's the... - Wait, wait, that's for me! Oh, here, dear. Hello, Acme? No, not the airport, bring it here. - Darling, um... - For my rain experiment. When are you gonna make it rain, Dad? Well, Stevie, according to my research here, if I can just get a super cool clo... Bob, let us decide what to do about the automobile first? Why, I thought we decided that. Wait a minute, I'll get that. Archive. Hello, Chet. Chet's down at the airport, got some weather reports he wants to read to me. Oh, yeah, dear. Oh, no, wait a minute, Chet, there are a couple of theories about that. Now, about 14,000ft over Mt. Greylock, Massachusetts... - Hello, Janie. - Oh, hi, Fred. - Looks like we've hit the jackpot. - What do you mean? Mrs. Holmes got almost $300's worth of new subsciptions. Oh, Fred, how wonderful! And you don't have to send the paper to most of them. She says all they wanted was a chance on the car. What do you mean? It's a very good paper, they bought the tickets, they're going to get the paper. Here, honey, you count those and get them all in order. All right, so we don't want snow. But all that snow evaporated before it hit the ground, didn't it, and the experiment was successful... Well, they used a spray-nozzle generator, they seeded the air continuously from dawn till a little after dusk. Package for Mr. MacAvoy. - Wait a minute, Chet. - Oh, what is it? - Fifty pounds of dry ice. - Oh. Excuse me, Chet, my dry ice just came, keep me posted. I think you ought to put this over here for me... Do you know what we have in this little box? Yeah, fifty pounds of dry ice. It's more than that, it's magic, it's the end of the drought. It's COD too, $2.50. - Pay the man, will you, darling? - Yes, dear. There you are. Fred, give me 50 cents, will you? - Fifty cents. - Thank you, thank you very much. - Now, it's... - Jane! - Yeah? - Come here, will you? Um... Yes, dear? Oh, Sister's bottle. Excuse me, Matthew. - Yes, dear, what is it? - Jane... Chet Dunne just had a weather report from San Francisco. Do you know there were cumulus clouds forming over southern Oregon? Now, cumulus or not, you'd better come out of those clouds till this contest is over. Yeah, but, hon, I promised the farmers rain, didn't I, it was your idea. Well, I didn't ask you to make the rain, I just asked for an editorial. I know, but if I get the proper cloud formation, I tell you I can't miss. - I'm counting the days. - All right, darling, all right. You count the days, hm? I'll count the money. Oh! Teams 1, 2 and 3 reporting, Mr. MacAvoy. You promised to show us how to run a newspaper. - Jane, dear. - Hm? Oh, no, no. Excuse me, men. Ja... Okay, guys, okay, fellows, okay... Now, Matthew here's going to show you how to run the linotype. Now pay very close attention, will you? The first thing do, you have to... Here, don't... don't... Get... Bob... keep your hands away from that reel... - Stand back, boys. - Mr. MacAvoy! How many, Mr. Graham? Well, I can't use more than one subscription, can I? No, but a year's subscription of the Archive would make a lovely present for a friend. And it will give you two chances to win. Besides saving me for making change, hm? Oh, thank you. There you are. Now, if you'll just fill in this stub here. - We did all right. - Here comes the boy in the bearskin rug. Oh, you! - Excuse me. Good morning, Mr. Trout. - Good morning. - Nice car, Mac. Pretty nifty. - Oh, I'm glad you like it. What happened to that wet stuff you promised to deliver to the farmers? Still waiting for those cumulus clouds. How long do you think we've been waiting? Yeah, when is it going to rain? Not today, but don't give up hope, all I need is the right cloud. - Jane. - Yes? Say, you know, I can't make up page one. Tonight's the night of the big dance and the drawing for the car... ...and I gotta save a box in the front page to announce the winner. - Yes, dear, I know you do. - Honey, where are your club notes? - I'm making up page two. - Oh, I haven't done them yet, dear. Honey, I'm making up page two. Well, put something else on page two and I'll have them ready by page four. - Put what? - Put what where? Put what on page 2? Oh... my cooking column. Well, have you written that? Oh, darling. I never write my cooking column. I just take the recipes out of this old cookbook here. Here, give it to Matthew, he'll know what to do with it. Cumulus cloud, cumulus cloud, cumulus cloud! Did Matthew find one? No, but Fred did and it's a great, big, fat, juicy one. What? - Jane, call the airport... ...and tell Chet Dunne to get that plane out of the hangar and start firing it up. No, I've got everything. Look at that cloud! See, cumulus clouds. - No, no, call the airport first! - Yeah. Hello, Nell? Yeah, Nell, get me 2... Oh, no, no, um... Chet, down at the airport. Sure you got that dry ice fine enough? - Positive. How do those clouds look to you now? Blacker than ever. A score of them now. Well, put on your hip boots and buy yourself an umbrella, boy, we're off. What's that? I'm afraid it's what you think it is. Well, let's go back. Stop the press! Jake, stop the press! - No, Mrs. MacAvoy, not now! - Yes, Homer, right now. I want a new headline. He did it! My own husband, he did it! Stevie, what are you doing outside in this kind of weather? Oh, Dad, I'm just taking these to the hotel. And it's our first extra. Better go inside before you get your feet wet, genius! Extra! Extra Paper! My daddy's a rainmaker! Extra! Extra! Jane. Jane! Bob! You are wonderful! You are absolutely wonderful! Well, if it isn't Jupiter pluvius. - You sure did milk that cloud. - You certainly did. - I tried to phone you, hon. - Oh, I'm sorry. You know I had to take the receiver off the hook. Everyone in town has been calling to congratulate you - Haven't they, Jake? - Oh, they shouldn't do that. Oh, they certainly should after the way they've been laughing at you. Oh, darling, I want to apologize for the way I've behaved to you. I just thought that you were neglecting the contest. And those farmers, do you know what they're gonna think? They're gonna think you're a magician. Oh, darling, you are a magician. And now, I think you'd better go right on upstairs and take a nice warm shower. - Your tux is all laid out for you. - My tux? Yes, the drawing for the car? We're due at the Lodge hall in 25 minutes. But, darling, I don't have to wear my tux... Oh, this is our first chance to dress up since we arrived in Eden... ...and we want to do it right, don't we? - Okay, give me five minutes. - You got it. I wonder how much of a down payment they'd want on a new press. Let me see... Here comes the rainmaker! Hello, boy, quite heavy rain! - Congratulations, Bob. - Thank you. Wonderful, real good job! Great work, Bob, we'll want you to make a speech about this at our next JC lecture. Fine, fine. - Mr. MacAvoy, you're a miracle man. - Thanks very much. - Hey, Bob! - Yeah? What a day, huh, kid? Hey look, they wanna believe it, let them. The trouble is... I'm beginning to believe it myself. Mrs. MacAvoy, I'm the envy of every man on the floor. Oh, you flatter me, mayor. Those envious glances are coming from the women, and why not? - You're such a beautiful dancer. - Oh, thank you. Oh, my goodness, I hope you didn't catch cold while you were seeding those clouds. - Seeding what? - Seeding, seeding the clouds. Seeding? Oh, no, you see... Would you like some lemonade, Mrs. Peterson? - Oh, yes, thank you. - You sit right here, I'll be right back. Thank you. Good luck. Oh, don't forget, Bob, speech next Tuesday. Okay, Al. - Mr. MacAvoy. - Yes. Abe Bartlett speaking, this is Mrs. Bartlett. - How do you do? - Well, I've kept my promise to your wife. You did? Why, that's fine, what promise? I told the little lady if you brought rain, I'd buy a subscription. - Well, here it is. - Wonderful, thank you. Thank you. Good luck. Come on, mama. Matthew, turn on the light. The light... the light, yes. Excuse me. - Didy. - Didy? - Diaper. - Oh, diaper. Careful now. - Powder. - Powder. - Powder. - Oh, powder. Excuse me. Turn out the light and go to sleep. Now gather round, everybody, gather round. First I want to welcome you all in the name of the Nightingale Lodge... ...to our annual affair. Now, before we serve supper, we're going to have the drawing... to see who will win the automobile... ...which is to be given away by our rainmaking editor. And his beautiful wife Jane. And now I want to introduce the man who is going to draw the lucky number. Mayor Hull. Thank you, Mrs. Spatch. Now, I know how eagerly you've all have been awaiting my speech... on the coming election, and, um... so we'll get on with the drawing. Oh, just a minute, your honor. The winning number... Three... O... two! Right here! - Wow! Well, congratulations! - Bartlett! Congratulations, Bartlett! You certainly hit the jackpot, didn't you? - God bless you, Mrs. MacAvoy! - Thanks, Mrs. Bartlett. Thanks. Well... - What did you get this time? - The same. Same as I did the first time or same as I did the second time? Same as you did second, third, and last times you counted it. - Eighteen dollars and... - Thirty-two cents. Well, considering everything, we ought to be thankful... that we made enough to pay for the car and... And also we got 1,120 new subscriptions and 300 renewals. - That's not bad, you know. - No, not bad, except... Now we can't handle it. Haven't got enough money to buy paper. Let alone but a new press. Well, farewell, you glamorous piece of machinery wherever you are. Eighteen dollars and thirty-two cents. What'll we do with it? Pay the grocery bill? I don't know, it's such an odd little sum, doesn't seem to fit any bill we owe. I love you. You know somehow tonight eighteen dollars or eighteen hundred... I'm very content. You know, I was feeling content one morning way back... when you kissed me awake and... ...you shoved the copy of the Editor and Publisher in front of my sleep-filled eyes. - Are you sorry? - No. Oh, darling. - You know, they like us here. - Hm-hmm. Is that what you mean by feeling content? Hm-hmm. Exactly. Do you realize how long it's been since we went up those stairs together? Hm-hmm. I'm so used to writing a note first I feel rather strange. You know why everyone was so nice tonight? Your rain. It was your rain that did it. Oh, Bob. - Darling. - Hm? Darling, it wasn't my rain. Oh, so many happy people, so grateful. - Jane. - Yes, what? - Jane. - I said what. What I'm trying to tell you is it wasn't my rain, it was... God's rain. - What? - Hm-hmm. Started before we got the plane off the ground. - Oh, no, Bob! - Oh, yes, Jane. And if you'd waited before you wrote that beautiful headline, I wouldn't have been standing up there like an idiot taking bows. Oh, darling, I'm so sorry. Oh, Bob, I... Well, listen, I'll tell you what you'll do. You write one of your cute editorials about it, see, and... Make a joke of it, but only tell them the truth. 'Cause that's our paper's policy, you know. On page one, next Thursday. Isn't that awful, I didn't... Bob! - Has that been there all night? - Hm-hmm. Well, why didn't you tell me? I was just so grateful that you hadn't sat on it. - Good morning, Stevie. - Good morning, Mommy. - What time is it? - Nine-thirty. Why aren't you in school? No school today on account of the rain. - From Daddy. - Here she is, all perked and dry. - Good morning, darling. - Thanks for letting me sleep late. It's all right. Nothing much you can do anyway till the rain lets up. Great, isn't it? I'm going to the bank, maybe this will let us float a loan, hm? - I hope so. - Bye-bye. He said I could go with him. He isn't always so abrupt, Sister, honestly he isn't. He really is very considerate and kind. And so clever. But just between us girls, what do you suppose he'll do if they want snow for Christmas? If this rain stops I'll go swimming in the pool. - What pool? - In the back yard. We ain't got no pool in the back yard. We have now. - It's still raining. - It ain't let up since you started it, Bob. - Coming down just fine. - Yep, awful good for the farmers. - Is it ever coming down. - Yeah. - No sign of it letting up? - No, not a sign, not a sign. Joel Simkins says that he's had to stop building on his new house. - Why, on account of the rain? - On account of the rain. He says if it keeps up two more days and two more nights like this, he's gonna put an outboard motor on it. She got it! There's no such thing as too much rain in California. - So I've heard, so I've heard. - Would you like a cup of tea, Fred? I'd love a cup of tea! - Why don't you look where you're rowing? - Why don't you hold out your hand? Say, Jane, tell Bob he can stop the rain any time now. Five days is enough even for us farmers. Stevie! Stevie, you know that you're not supposed to play in here. But I can't go outside because it's still rai... - No, no... don't say it. - Is it all right? Yeah, yeah, go on, play, Stevie, it's fine. This time it's your turn. Archive. Yes, Mrs. Wallace. No, Mrs. Wallace, he ain't in. The 4-tracker just floated away. What does she want me to do, swim after it? Mrs. Wallace, I got a paper to print. All right, Mrs. Wallace, I won't print one for you. Go ahead, sue him. And I for one hold MacAvoy personally responsible. Now, look, Myron, I practically promised him a loan for some newsprint. That was only the day after he started the rain. Now just a minute, Myron. All I know is we were a peaceful, happy little town... ...until the MacAvoys descended on us. Digging up old pictures, and breaking down cumulus clouds. They should be asked to leave town. Now, Myron, as mayor of this town I... As mayor of this town you should do something about it. - Do what? - Well, call a meeting of the town council. Say what they think should be done about this... this weather changer. It'll certainly count in your favor when you come up for reelection. I know the book says I shouldn't do this, but she' so sweet, and soft and cuddly, I can't help it. - What's the matter? - Nothing. What particularly nothing? Rain-rain go away? Just found out they're having a meeting tomorrow morning. Myron Trout's trying to figure out some way to get us out of town. So what? There are hudreds of towns that would roll out a red carpet for a man like you. - Jane. - Yeah? We're going back to New York. Just phoned the paper and got my old job back. Oh? Now why didn't I think of that? Nice steady job, same salary every week. No worrying about subscriptions, no trying to sell ads to merchants who think Grover Cleveland is still President. Something I gotta tell you, though. Same old salary, same hours, nights. And one hitch. We've gotta be there in six days. Wish we had that car we gave away. Sure would be nice to drive back east, wouldn't it? Let's see. First thing we have to do is to sell the paper. I'll run an ad in the Editor and Publisher. And I'll explain to whoever it is that buys it... I'll explain to him the mistakes I made. The things I did wrong. Things we did wrong, dear. - He'll have a good paper, whoever he is. - He sure will. And we won't be any worse off than we were back in New York, will we? We'll be much better off. We've got Sister now. You know that you're very sweet. I certainly do hate to be happy at a time like this, but... I just can't help it. We've got an awfully good marriage you and I, Bob. Bakery basement, flooded. Loss estimated at $400. And Myron Trout, damage to men's shop $100, damage to car fender $25. Yes, but Mr. Mayor, aren't you forgetting that you said it would cost $500... ...to fix the bandstand and to put the park back in shape? That's right. I want $210, I can't find my patio. Oh, of course, Clarissa, I have that down here. Um, all the rest are small items. Do you want me to itemize them? Just give them the total. Well, it's just a little over $7,000, it's $7,098.60. You hear that, MacAvoy, now how about... Myron, please sit down. Mr. MacAvoy, $7,000 is a great deal of of money to a small community like Eden. And all the damage can be traced to the current rains. - Therefore, we hold you responsible... - Myron! Myron, sit down, don't be such a... Babbit! - Yes, sit down. - Let the meeting decide what's what. Quiet down, Myron, we'd better decide it. We'd like to hear from you, Mr. MacAvoy. Mayor Hull, I don't know what more to say, except to say what I said before, that I did not start that rain. As Chet testified, it started before I got the plane off the ground. That's not the story told the night of the dance. We needed rain then. And the only guy who was doing anything about getting us a little was Bob. It did start to rain before he got a chance to try out his scheme. But I felt he deserved a pat on his back for all his troubles and... I still do. Mr. MacAvoy has become a little tin god around here because of his rain. For what it's worth, I wrote an editorial... ...telling the true story about the rain for Thursday's paper. But as is its custom, our press broke down. Oh, do whatever you like about it. Come on, Jane. I'll see you later, Fred, Chet. Dear, just a minute. Mr. Mayor, may a lady have a word? Yes, Mrs. MacAvoy, of course, go ahead. Thank you. Well, um... Being a woman, as well as my husband's partner in the Archive, I can't resist being first with the news. I'm afraid it's going to be good news to some. And I'm very happy to say, it's going to be sadness to others. Bob and I are leaving Eden. And so I want to say goodbye and how I thank you. Some wonderful things have happened to us here. Our daughter was born here. And Stevie and Bob and I have made some very dear friends. And as for me personally, I saw a man come face to face with a dream of his here. And believe me, that's an experience too few wives have ever had. You saw a stranger move into your town with his family. To Bob there are no strangers, just people he hasn't met yet. And you saw a man joining clubs and civic groups and... writing little editorials and... ...reporting on the trivial happenings of everyday people. And with the exception of a silly cloud seeding, doing nothing big at all. Nothing to shake the world. Well... trivial happenings are the world. They are people. And if you believe in the fundamental worth and goodness of the people right around you, then you believe in the fundamental goodness of America and the world. Bob believed that. That's why we came here. And Bob will always believe it, that's why we can never really be hurt. And I'm sorry for you. I'm sorry for you that he's leaving, because you'll miss him. As for us, well, there's nothing really to be sorry about. And I'm so proud he didn't fail you. But then he couldn't fail anyone. Because he's that... special kind of man. Well, that's about all I have to say. Except, um... I want to thank you again... ...and I'm glad we came. Mrs. MacAvoy, it's all very well, but it doesn't answer my only concern. What? The $7,000 damage caused by your husband's rain. Oh, that. Well, Mr. Trout, if you'll be kind enough to come to the Archive... ...at 4 o'clock this afternoon, we hope to give you that answer. And by the way, that goes for all of you. Thank you, Mr. Mayor. Jane, what's this about that 4 o'clock business? Why did you ask them to come by? Well, darling, let me give you a pleasant surprise for once, huh? You'll see. Hi, Jake, come on in. I just come up to give Sister's lunch. Why, she had her lunch an hour ago. Well, I'd better start warming her next bottle. Is there anything I can do for you? Not that I want to. Jack, you know all the backpay that we owe both you and Matthew, well, that's our most important debt, and we'll send it to you just as... Now you just keep still about that. You don't owe Matthew and me anything. Janie, you remember that first headline Bob wrote? Editor's wife brings new life to Archive. Let me tell you something. You and Bob and Stevie and... ...little Sister brought new life to Matthew and me. We was just two old misfits dying on the vine till you come along. Guess I'd better go get that bottle. Darling, don't you start it too now. - All packed, Stevie? - Yes, Dad. H-Hey, Jake. Isn't that Myron Trout coming over here? Looks like the whole crowd over there. And that's Van Fleet and the mayor with him. - They're on the way... - And old lady Dow with him. I hope they fall in the mud. They got no business over here. What do they want to come over here for, why do they want to bother the MacAvoys? They're such nice kids, why don't they stay out of... Hello, boys! Why don't you people stay home and mind your own business? Well, I guess that's everything. - Except this. - What? - Oh. - Might as well use the same ad. One small addition to the copy: "No rainmakers need apply". - All set? - Yeah, hm-hmm. You drove them to a point where they're leaving, now what else do you want? - You got no right to come in here. - Just a minute, please. Jake, Matt, Mrs. MacAvoy asked us to be here at four. She's got something she wants to say to us, and we've got somethng to say to them. They're a little early. You didn't really think we'd let you get away from us, did you? Mr. MacAvoy, Eden is known in this part of the country as the friendly town. I'm afraid we'll have to change our slogan... ...if you don't change your mind and give us another chance. I don't understand. When I left the meeting, you all appeared to be... - Behaving very badly. - We certainly did. What Janie said made us stop long enough to take a good look at the situation. I don't see what all this fuss is about. The rain was a good thing for us farmers. I'm glad, Mr. Bartlett. I'm glad it was good for somebody. Well, it was good for a lot of people. I know some who sold enough umbrellas and raincoats to retire. Well... I did sell quite a few. Look, it stopped raining. Here, Bob, hold Sister for me. And my raincoat. Excuse me, excuse me. Just a minute. Don't go away, I'll be right back. Are you Mr. Loomis? Please say yes. - Yes. - Oh, good, come right with me. Um, you don't need that, it's stopped raining. - So it has. - So it has.
