3,500 years ago, a great and powerful dynasty emerged from the central Chinese plains; The Shang. Their armies were led by a fierce and brilliant general. Her name: Fu hao. In the city of Anyang, her undisturbed tomb was discovered, but there was something very unusual about this famous Shang queen. Along with exquisite jewelry and elaborate bronze pieces, a multitude of weapons were found. This was the grave of a great warrior. The tomb of fu hao was one of the most important archeological discovery of the bronze age. Many archeologists believe the Shang are the first dynasty of China. We can trace the origins of Chinese writing to the Shang dynasty. It's the only ancient written language still in active use. Based on the latest research and archeological findings, we recreate the life of the Shang Princess who became a general, priestess, and queen. At the national museum of Scotland, an east Asia collection was created in the 1850s. It holds the most important piece of evidence about China's first female general; a tiny inscription on a ritual turtle shell. In our collection, we have this piece of oracle bone, someone divined, fu hao, raised 3,000 men, joined with another 10,000 men, for a military attack. This inscription has the largest number of a military forces recorded from the time. This oracle bone shows that fu hao was a very capable military leader. In around 1200 bce, hao, the daughter of a leading Shang lord, is sent to the capital for an arranged marriage to the king. At the beginning of the trojan wars, the new Egyptian kingdom and the babylonian empire, the Shang were one of the world's most advanced bronze age civilizations. Their kings ruled from the capital, dayishang. In the valleys around the yellow river, the Shang lords had transformed forests into fertile farm lands with the help of a massive peasant labor force. Hao and her entourage create a stir. The sight of horses and chariots would have been a very rare thing. They're associated with the senior elite of society. Hao's childhood friend, officer yu, has been entrusted to protect the Princess at the king's court. Travel outside the Shang settlements could be dangerous. Nomadic bandits lie in wait for the travelers. Yu and his guards fight off the raiders, helped by hao's archery skills. In the 1970s, hao's tomb was discovered in Yinxu by Chinese archeologist Zheng Zhenxiang at the site of the Shang capital. In fu hao's tombs we found a very large number of weapons, both made in bronze, and also jade. Her life were much involved in martial activities and also in military engagements. Victory brings benefits. The captured bandits are a currency in the Shang world. Some of them may have been used for conscript labor in the fields, maybe as tribute submitting them to the Shang king. The prospect of becoming a king's tribute terrifies the prisoners. Hao arrives at dayishang. Over 100,000 people are living here. I can only imagine what must have gone through her head when she first caught sight of the Shang capital, it must've been the largest settlement in China at the time, one of the largest settlements anywhere in the world. At the heart of the capital are the luxurious royal palaces and temples next to a manmade lake. It was home to the Shang king, wu ding. Wu ding was a military king who personally led his armies to expand the Shang heartland in all directions. King wu ding certainly brought stability to the sun state. Wu ding, in Chinese meaning martial ding, which indicates he was a very capable military general. Hao arrives well-prepared for the moment she meets her future husband. A grim fate awaits hao's prisoners at the hands of the king. Hao takes one last look at her old friend, yu, knowing her life will never be the same. The king's first queen is fu jing, who is determined to defend her status in court. A Shang king always favors the right, so that is where his favorite queen should sit. For now, Princess hao must accept her seat to the left. Princess hao, when she arrived at the sun court, she would have faced some very complicated social and personal relationships. The king had at least 64 wives, and she would have become one of the three royal consorts. Officer yu presents another special wedding gift from hao's clan; Prized ox shoulder blades used for important divination ceremonies for the Shang ancestors. In dayishang, tens of thousands of oracle divination bones have been discovered in pits around the palace complex. The fragmentary bones and turtle shells were covered with detailed inscriptions about childbirth, harvests and warfare. Offering help and advice to the living from the deceased ancestors and the Shang gods. The king calls his diviner to prepare a ceremony predicting the outcome of his marriage to hao. In order to show off his status, the diviner presents precious turtle shells as an offering from his own clan instead. His gift rejected, the diviner is humiliated. The diviner was probably someone who was thought to possess special powers, special sensitivities. They may, in fact, have functioned almost like a kind of senior priesthood. In the royal temple, as the oracle bones are prepared, the diviner and the jealous first queen scheme to derail hao's wedding ceremony. In the Shang dynasty capital of dayishang, king wu ding seeks approval from the ancestors for his marriage to hao. To obtain their answer, the diviner inserts a heated poker to crack the ox bone. This is a fragmentary turtle shell that was specially prepared for the divination ceremony. If you look at the back of the shell, you can see there's specially prepared notches that were cut into the back. And it was the application of heat in these hollowed areas on the back of the bone that actually caused the bone or the shell to crack. The way the bone cracks will show the ancestors' answer. The diviner insists that the ancestors disapprove of the king's forthcoming marriage to hao. The divination did not always lead to a clear answer. The diviner could have been involved in interpreting the cracks, the king could have been involved in interpreting the cracks. Princess hao intervenes. She knows the diviner tampered with the bone. She spots another crack with a quite different outcome; a sign that her marriage will bring good fortune. The system certainly, to modern eyes, appears that it could have been manipulated. From now on, hao is assured she will become a queen. The outcome is inscribed in the bone. Over 50,000 Shang oracle bones were discovered in Anyang. The 3,000 year old inscriptions record the story of fu hao, king wu ding, and the history of the Shang dynasty. You can see the crack and you can also see the inscriptions that narrate the subject of the divination ceremony. The characters are very pictographic; you can see a depiction of a four legged animal down here in the corner. In Washington, DC, the national museum of Asian art is part of the Smithsonian institution, which funded some of the early excavations of the ancient Shang capital that was later named Yinxu. In dayishang, a ceremony is held for hao's wedding, led by queen fu jing. The captives are to be sacrificed as an offering to the ancestors. For her wedding ceremony, there was one more offering to the ancestors; meat cooked in an elaborate cauldron cast in the finest bronze in China. This 2,000 pound ritual vessel was discovered at Anyang. It is the heaviest bronze work in the ancient world inscribed from king wu ding to his queen fu jing. In the palace temple, fu jing reluctantly presides over a ceremony for the new queen. Fu hao joins fu jing and fu gui as the third queen, all from the most loyal and powerful clans of the Shang. Fu hao prepares for her first night with the king. A lot depends on this for her clan's status at court. Fu hao's future and the standing of her clan rests on her first night with the king. For a young woman, she was facing many challenges, and also she would have competitions from others. The next morning, hao is taken away from the king's chambers by fu jing. Fu hao realizes that she is now just one of many. Hao seeks solace in a beautiful jade phoenix given to her by her father as a symbol of her clan's strength. She is determined not to be one of the king's faceless marriage trophies. Fu hao's tomb contained 865 pieces similar to these made of jade and marble, the most valuable materials of the Shang period. Next to the 564 beautiful carved ivory and shell objects, more high status jewelry was discovered. Hao's old friend, yu, does his best to take care of the valuable horses. Hao shows him the correct amount of feed. She has an affinity with horses. The king is intrigued by hao's independent and determined nature, and impressed by her horsemanship. The transmission of horse culture is something that is still a little bit of a mystery. It's thought that the idea of horses can be associated with fu hao's time. In fu hao's tomb, we've found a particular kind of skinning knife that often has a horse head handle that suggests to us that she may have had a closer personal connection. By demonstrating her superior riding skills, hao shows she is truly different from the other queens. The flourishing Shang kingdom was surrounded by many dangerous tribes, constantly challenging and attacking his defenses. King wu ding is desperate for news from his army fighting in the troubled border region. The first queen, fu jing, was with his troops. In the royal temple, the king seeks guidance about his military response. No one in the palace knows who will be chosen as general to suppress the trouble at the border. The ancestors' advice means that fu hao has boosted her status; she is now a queen and a general. The Shang was almost constantly at war, and warfare was an important aspect of the ruler's responsibility maintaining and protecting the state. The many bronze workshops in dayishang relied on secure trade routes for the supply of tin and copper from the south. The urban settlement also traded horses, salt and jade from the north. The flourishing trade had to be protected at all costs. To deal with the unrest on the Northwestern border, fu hao is advised by the experienced general, ju. Fu hao has a core unit of professional soldiers who will be supplemented along the way by conscripts. In the center of modern day Anyang, not far from the old palaces, we find the royal burial complex at xiaotun. Here, chariots and their horses found all across the Shang capital have been brought together. As a general, fu hao needs to conscript more soldiers. Shang armies relied on peasant farmers to bolster the ranks. General fu hao's recruiters arrive in what seems to be a deserted village. Fu hao is impressed by the women's courage. She negotiates with village leader, pang, and offers rich awards for the men to join the army. Fu hao recruits the village women to her army. Fu hao still needs more soldiers, but that's a problem for the local Shang lords. Peasant labor was vital to farm their lands. Fu hao holds a special sacrifice ceremony for the ancestors in support of her for military campaign. The Shang always gave one symbolic drink to their ancestors. It's thought that in the Shang, really the measure of wealth was probably more based on labor. The number of able-bodied hands you had for clearing fields, for building, for farming, rather than owning land itself. To break the deadlock, general fu hao suggests that the lords will be sacrificed if they don't deliver troops. Her ruthless message brings them back into line. There was constantly shifting of powers, and also alliances, and certainly from oracle bone inscription we know some groups were allies of the Shang, and those later shifted to be enemies. On the morning before battle, general fu hao inspects her troops one last time. She is proud to see pang and her women fighters amongst the men. General fu hao leads her army into battle against the enemy, carrying the ax of a Shang commander. Two large axes like this were found in fu hao's tomb. They're large and very heavy. To find an object like this in a Shang elite tomb suggests that the occupant of the tomb was a great military leader, or maybe a ritual leader. Fu hao lines up her troops for her first battle as a queen and general. General fu hao prepares to lead her army into combat for the first time. Then the royal guard and the queen herself join the battle. The conflict descends into a chaotic melee of hand-to-hand combat over a large area. From the fragmented evidence we have on oracle bones. They're some campaign took quite a long time. It is unlikely one large military campaign could be settled by one decisive battle. General ju fights alongside the village women. Fu hao spots the enemy commander. The Shang win the day, but not without loss. In a special ceremony in honor of her victory, fu hao consults the Shang ancestors. The cracks in the oracle bone decree that the prisoners of war are to be sacrificed. It may be shocking to us, but human sacrifice was a vital part of Shang life. Whole skeletons, skulls, beheaded skeletons are found in various combinations, sometimes in association with royal burials, and sometimes in other locations at the Shang site. It seems to have been an important part of ritual practice. After her victory, fu hao's prominence in court is established. She takes over many of the king's duties. She would have many different roles on the management of state affair, to agricultural work, or to perform divination on behalf of the king. The national museum of Scotland holds an important collection of Shang oracle bones. Among the ancient bone fragments we find evidence of fu hao's continuing success on the battlefield. This oracle bone has the date of the divination, and now we lost the diviners name, but we do have the question, which is: "If queen fu hao raised 3,000 men, and joined them with another 10,000 men for a campaign, would she receive assistant?" But it shows fu hao was trusted with such large forces and indicates her ability as a military leader. Over the years, hao has become wu ding's favorite queen. The king instructs his diviner to prepare a ceremony to predict the sex of their child. As his most trusted advisor, fu hao now sits on the right of wu ding as they receive the results of the divination. Fu hao gave birth to a boy. Over the years, the couple enjoy spending time together alone in the royal forests. Hunting has many different functions; it's not just an occasion out and capture the game for food, but it's also a way of martial training for the king and all for the other elites. The royal couple's time would soon be cut short. Sometime in the 12th century bce, Shang king realizes that his irreplaceable queen is dying. Fu hao was just 33. It is likely king wu ding would be devastated when fu hao passed away at a relatively young age. This is mostly likely because fu hao was a very capable woman and supported the king in many aspects over the state's governance. King wu ding misses his queen, priestess and general so much that he insists on burying her not in the royal cemetery, but right next to his palace. It's remarkable that the king didn't want her buried far from him and suggests a desire to keep that kind of proximity, that kind of connection even after her death. The grieving king assembles valuable grave goods to comfort fu hao in the world of the Shang ancestors. Another tradition was for close friends or family to accompany the deceased. Fu hao's guardian, yu, makes a special request. From the archeological evidence, based on the royal tombs, we can deduct that some of the sacrificed human were likely to have had a close relationship with the king or other royal family members. In Shang's belief system, the deceased would continue to influence the living world. Wu ding considered fu hao could continue support him, advise him. Wu ding is receiving a special ambassador, but without his beloved advisor, he struggles with state affairs. It is really fascinating to think this piece of bone on my palm now is 3,000 years old. When they performed this divination, king wu ding and fu hao would be present in the same space, and how amazing that is. To me, personally, fu hao was an extraordinary woman. She allows us to reevaluate how we think about women's role in the ancient world. Thanks to the discovery of her tomb, the legacy of fu hao, the Shang dynasty, and the birth of the Chinese civilization lives on.
