(crickets chirping) - Now this isn't right, this isn't even a road. - Trust me. - It just doesn't look at all like what she described. - Well it is nighttime. - I'm telling you, we should've gone left at that petrol station. - Well I'm telling you, this is right. - Well excuse me if I don't explicitly trust your sense of direction. - You cannot keep throwing your mom's birthday back in my face. - We were nearly two hours late. - Yeah, what a crying shame that would've been. - See, this is why they invented GPS. - You do know that people managed to find their way for thousands of years before GPS was invented. - Yeah, they also died of smallpox back then as well. (car engine growls) - [Kasey] Shall we ask for directions? Yeah? - Where the hell have you been? I thought we were lost. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, I know, Louis wanted to have a drink before we set off and-- - [Reese] You've been drinking? - Just a little something to settle the nerves. - [Reese] Unbelievable. - Mia's sure we can still trust him? - Well, you should see the way the little friggen' baguette boy looks at her. Anyway, here are a few accessories fresh from the catwalks of Paris, you should look very fetching. Okay, gotta get going, so don't forget to park in front of the bakery, yeah? - In the blind spot, we know. - Yeah, yeah, bonne chance. - Zander's right you know? This'll really bring out your eyes. (car engine growls) (intense, suspenseful orchestral music) (soft, intense music) - You see the way Mia jumped that fence? Fucking bad ass. - The others should be back by now. - [Mia] Guys, clear some space. - Is that a good idea? - I want to look at it. - What is French for we are fucking rich? Your dad's got really shit taste in art. - Don't knock it, it's worth more than the house. - At least put it away if you're gonna throw vodka around. - Oh, come on, shh. Happy. Wait what's that even say? Henry, go on do your French. (speaks in French) - And where the hell are they? - Shouldn't you get onto Eddie and let him know it's done? - I want to wait until they're back. - [Mia] He'll be waiting too. - Fine. - Yeah but, they can still track a laptop can't they? Does this mean I can get my phone back? - No, because Eddie set him up with a fake account. - Yeah but, you know this whole radio silence thing, it's probably more conspicuous than if I checked in at your Dad's gallery. I'm just saying, people are gonna notice if I just disappear. - No phones, that was the rule. - [Eddie] I can't believe you shitheads actually pulled it off. - I told you we'd do it. - No problems? - It was just as Mia said it would be. - Her daddy's gonna be pissed. - I think that's the point. - Sounds like my kinda lass. Anyway, I suppose I should be getting myself on a ferry. - Yeah, the sooner we get out of this place, the better. - I'll sort it all, don't worry, just sit tight, okay? And look after the fucking thing, yeah? - Don't worry. - Okay, I'll be seeing you. - To your dad, for being rich enough to waste money on art, and stupid enough to leave it lying around. - Amen! - You think he'll suspect you? - That would involve him thinking about someone else for a second. - What'd Eddie say? - [Sean] He's on his way. - Oh cool, when's he gonna get here? - I don't know exactly Zander, I didn't ask for his itinerary. As soon as he can, I guess. (car horn honks) - Here we go. (ominous music) What time do you call this? - Sean was shitting himself. Where's Louis? - Yeah, where's Frenchie? - [Kasey] Something happened. - What? - Don't freak out. - [Sean] What's happened? - It was all so fast, okay? - Where's Louis? Oh my God. - Oh fuck! - [Mia] What the hell happened? - A guard just came out of nowhere. - Well is he dead? - He looks pretty fucking dead to me. - Why didn't you do something? - Like what exactly? - Well why didn't you take him to a hospital? - And get us both arrested? No chance. - No, what are you doing, don't touch it! - We have to check. Oh God, he's dead. - We're dead. - No, no we're not. - We killed someone. - How are you so calm? - We didn't do this. - Oh, so we're innocent? - Yes, no. I don't know, but this is not our fault. - I told him it'd be easy. - And you could've saved him. - Are you kidding? You'd have done the exact same thing if you were in that car. - No, I would've have. - Do not get high and mighty with me-- - How could you be this-- - There's nothing we could do, Sean. - You don't know that. - Look at him. Do you think he stood a fucking chance? - You could've tried. - I'm not having this argument. - No, course not, because whatever you say goes, isn't that right? - Look, some of us need this money. You know, like actually need it. - Yeah, well now someone is dead. Guys? - Well, it's done now. So, well go on then, what do we do? - Yeah but that does not mean that we're not responsible. - Oh, come on, don't be so fucking naive? - It's done! - No, wait, we can't just leave him in there. - Why not? - 'Cause he's gonna leak. - Jesus, Zan. - Look, I'm sorry, but, it's a rental. - All right, all right we'll move him. Somewhere out of the way. (ominous music) - Not much of a resting place. - Well it's dry, and away from the house. - It's all my fault. - You can't blame yourself. - He only did it because I asked. - He was in it for the money, Mia, same as us. - [Mia] And look where it got him. - What, here, here? - Yeah. - Okay. Okay, okay. Okay, help me grab that. - What's the point in that? - Well it doesn't hurt to be cautious. - Sorry, Louis. - [Zander] He was a bit of a prick though. - Zander! - What? No, come on, he was always perving over Mia. - In a weird way I guess this makes it easier. - What? - Dividing the money, goes into five shares, much easier than six. - How can you even? He earned his cut. - It's no use to him now. - You've changed your tune. - Well what are we supposed to do? Track down his poor French mother? - I can't believe it, you just want to take it. - Look me in the eye and tell me you weren't thinking exactly the same thing on the drive over. - I see, so you'll give us shit for not taking him to a hospital, but you're all cool with robbing a corpse, that's some fine moral compass you got there. - Fuck you, we don't all have jobs waiting for us back home. - [Reese] You think I like working for my dad? - Can you two just please give it a rest for once? - Yep, or get a ruler out. - Kase? Are you all right? - Oh, so now you care? - That was really scary, I just wanted to-- - You don't get to have it both ways. Sure. - This one is to Louie. Ready? - Jesus Zan, it's not even nine a.m. - I think it's well deserved. Come on, to Louis. (groans gleefully) Let's go again. - [Kasey] Reese, Reese what are you doing? - Putting it somewhere safe. - But I thought it was locked? - It was, it'll be out of the way up here, safe from that lot. - What can they do? - Listen to them, they think it's all over, they've done their bit. - They've risked just as much as us. - Yeah, and I'll be damned if they're gonna fuck it up for us now. - Shit. Wow. I thought Mia's dad was one of those neat obsessives. - No, not by the looks of this. I don't know how somebody can have so much stuff and not want any of it. - It's a wise man who appreciates what he's got before it's gone. - Kasey, listen-- - [Kasey] Don't. - Look, can you just fucking hear me out? I know none of this was, what I mean is, you're right, I don't get to have it both ways. But it's nice we can be friends again. Pass it all off as a bit of stupid fun, no harm. - Stupid fun. - Well what else would you call it? - [Kasey] Well I thought you-- - Do you need a minute? - [Reese] Leave it Sean. - What do you want? - You disappeared up here with the painting. I think I have a right to see what you're doing. - Don't you trust us? - I just want to check for myself. - That's a no, then. - Hmm. Wait, we need to be able to find it again, you know? - I'm just being cautious. What if the police turn up? - Oh yeah, 'cause they're sure to be foiled by your cunning hiding place. Besides, wouldn't we be in handcuffs right now if they knew who we were? - That doesn't mean they won't put it together later. Who knows what they might find. We were careful in there, were you? - I'm not the only who brought back a fucking dead guy! - Okay, you guys need to calm down. No one knows we're here, not even Mia's dad. The only one was Louis and, well. - Yeah, that's one less loose end. All right, I'm gonna get some sleep. I suggest you do the same. - What about outside? It could take awhile to dig that deep. - Speaking from experience? - I don't know what you ever saw in him. - [Mia] Hey. - Hey what? - I can't remember how tall he was. - What? - Louis. I mean, I know he was taller than me but, how big does this thing need to be? - Come then, we'll go faster with the two of us. - [Mia] Thanks. - So go on, what are you gonna do with your share? - I don't know, go traveling, buy stuff. Thing is, I can do whatever I like now. - Yeah but, won't your dad wonder where you got all the money from? - Like he'd actually care. He'd probably think I started selling drugs or something. Maybe he'll try to buy some off me. - Yeah well I'm gonna buy a houseboat, me. - What? - Yep, not one of those like, shitty canal boats, no like, a proper one. With like rooms and everything. - Yeah, dream big. - Yeah come on, think about it. If I ever get bored of living in the same place, then, screw it, I just set off some place else. You know, no mortgages and all that crap. Just somewhere that was mine, forever. (gentle piano music) - It does sound good actually. - Hey. Promise me you're gonna visit. - Please, you'll be needing a spare room just for me. (somber piano music) - All right, where the hell is Reese? Come on, it's gotta be his turn now. - Do you want me to give him a shout? - Him and Kasey are sleeping upstairs. Separately. - I wish those two never hooked up. It's really messed up with the group dynamics. - Yeah. Well Reese has been in a sulk this whole holiday. - Yeah, he can be a right dick when he's in a mood. - Don't do the same mistake. - What? - Kasey? It's really hard to go back once you've crossed that line. Just saying. - I need a drink. - He should really let this Kasey thing go. - Honestly, just leave him to it. You know, if those three want to implode on each other, then so be it, and great, more money for us. (suspenseful music) - [Kasey] Sean? Sean! - Thank you. - [Kasey] Thank you. - Just like in uni. - Though no one's drinking gin out of a pan. - That's enough, I'm not that hungry. - Oh then, pass it over here. 'Cause some of us have worked up an appetite digging a fucking grave. I am getting the wine. - Careful, last time we all sat around drinking wine Mia hatched a criminal plot. - Well what can I say? It brings out my devious side. - What's it gonna be this time? Grand theft auto? What's a little murder between friends? - Any update from Eddie? - Radio silence. - I don't see why he didn't come sooner. - I don't think he really believed we'd pull it off. - Can you blame him? - I didn't think we'd pull it off either. - And yet, here we are. - Yeah well, he better hurry up, 'cause this place is giving me the creeps. - We still have to finish up outside tonight, too. - Even better, I just want to get out of here. - Yeah we all do. - Well, let's hope I don't go stir crazy. - Read a book, take your mind off it. - Yeah 'cause you can talk. All work and no play makes Reese a very dull boy, yeah. - Then go stretch your legs after we've eaten. - [Mia] Yeah well, if you do, don't wander too far, it's getting to be dark. - And? - Don't tell me you're scared. - Only of tripping over a root and breaking my neck. - Not sure there's enough room in the woodshed for two. (laughing) - I can't believe you just said that. - You know, my dad told me a creepy story about those woods. - Okay, let me guess. It is the jilted ghost of a woman in white who lurks the hallways looking to avenge her former lover. - I can get behind that. - How about, just got it, it's better, okay? It is haunted by a dead soldier from the war. And sometimes, at night, if you listen very closely you can hear his parachute harness jangling from the branches above you. - That's not scary, ghosts have gotta be from like, like olden times. - Okay, what, are you like 12? World War II is olden days. - Okay, just let me tell you the actual story. - [Sean] Here we go. - So there's this stone in the middle of the wood called the witch's needle. Apparently they buried an old witch there, and put this huge stone on top of it to stop her climbing out of her grave. The story goes that one night, two teenagers were walking in the woods when they start hearing footsteps on the path behind them. At first, they don't really think much about it. There's loads of villagers around. But then, their torches goes out. And as they stand there in the darkness, the footsteps get closer and closer. It's pitch black. And suddenly, they can feel it, breathing on the back of their necks. The one with the torch desperately presses the switch, when suddenly, finally, it gets on. Only now, he's the only one standing in the woods. His friend has vanished. He panics and starts running, desperate to get out. And then, he hears it again. Footsteps on the path behind him. (door slams loudly) - Scared, Zan? - [Zander] Piss off. - Don't really see what that's got to do with a dead witch. - Well, some things just can't stay buried. - [Reese] Well that's shit. - [Kasey] Well go on then, you tell a better one. - That stuff's all for kids. - [Zander] Killjoy. - Yeah, come on, it's just a bit of stupid fun. - Funny, I'm not allowed to use that excuse. - Nice going. - Kasey. - What? - Well Kasey. Why can't you just keep your mouth shut? - [Kasey] Hi. - I am knackered. - Being a criminal really takes it out of you. - I don't mean that. I just cooked for five people. I don't know how my mom did it for so many years. Listen, I wanted to ask you. Louis, what happened? - Reese said he was slow coming out the door. Guard saw him. - So you weren't there? - I'd gone to get the car, that was my job. But why does this matter? - Just something Reese said. - You are beyond paranoid? - Can you blame me? This whole thing has turned into a fucking nightmare. It was meant to be easy, and now we have a body on our hands. - Please, don't. - How do you seem so okay with it all? - I'm not okay with this. Of course I'm not, but you know I need that money, my mom. It was an accident, what happened to Louis. I wish he was still alive, I wish none of it had happened, but, I just keep thinking that this is going to save my mom's life. - Do you trust Reese? - Why? - None of this has turned out how we expected, and that makes people do stupid things. - You two used to be best mates. - Yeah well, lately I've seen what kind of a man he is. How can someone who says that they love you just throw you away like that? He'll be kicking himself in no time. Okay, he dumped you just before you struck it rich. That makes him an utter moron. - Yeah. - But you liked him, okay? You made a move and it didn't work out, so what? It's always the stuff you don't do that you regret more. Not the stuff that you do. Whoa, I thought, Reese-- - Do you really want to be thinking about him right now? (intense piano music) (heavy breathing and moaning) (frightening piano music) - [Mia] What? - That, why do you do that? Why do you that? What's his problem? - How long do you have? (heavy breathing and moaning) (ominous music) (breathes heavily) - Mia? What about this one? - I think my mom got it in a second hand shop. - Oh, it's nothing special then. - [Mia] Nah. - No? So why hasn't your dad pimped out this place yet? - He hates coming here. Rarely does if he can avoid it. He keeps telling about selling the house, although it was my mom's favorite place. Like he gives a shit, I suppose. - Wanker. - Yeah. I mean, honestly, it was like seven months after she died that he tells me he's seeing someone new. - Well if my dad did that, I would never speak to him again. - Yeah well, hopefully I'll never have to. Ever again. Enough talk about that tosser, do you want another drink? - Yeah. (loud pounding and mumbling) - [Mia] The fuck? Are you joking? - [Reese] He's gone! - What? - [Reese] Louie, he's gone. - Wait, wait, wait, what do you mean he's gone? - I mean he's not fucking there. (ominous music) See? - Reese, what did you do? - [Reese] I haven't fucking touched him. - Who would do that? - Fuck, fuck, fuck, he's gone! - [Kasey] What's going on? - [Mia] Get over here! - But he was just here, I don't understanding. - How could he move, when? - Reese just noticed it now, didn't you hear him shouting? - [Kasey] Are you fucking with us? - What? - I swear to God if you've moved him-- - [Reese] Why the hell would I do that? - Oh I can think of a few reasons. - You really think that I would, you must have gone fucking mental. - No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, maybe, maybe, maybe a wild animal took him. Well come on, we are in the middle of nowhere. - We're still in fucking France. - Yeah, I know we're in France, but there are still like foxes, or a dog maybe? - Oh you think a dog just dragged him off? - Yeah, well how would you explain it? What do you suggest? - Wait, wait, wait. What if he walked away? - You really have lost it. - I mean, what if he wasn't dead? - No, I checked his pulse, he was dead. - Yeah, but you're not a nurse though, are you? Maybe you did it wrong? - No, I checked his pulse. He was dead. There's no way. - Oh fuck. - Louis? Louis! Louis. - Fucking pointless. - [Mia] Louis! - Louis! Louis! - You rushed off earlier. - I could hear them downstairs, I didn't want to wake you. - You could've waited for me. - Don't get your knickers in a twist. - If you woke up out here, all alone, where would you go? - Don't know. I doubt he knows where he is, or if he can even think straight at all. - We have to find him. If someone else gets to him first-- - I know, I know. - [Sean] We should've made sure. - Well we thought we did. - Well not like that. I'd do anything for you, you know? - What? - You I would do-- - [Kasey] Zan! Any luck? - Nope. And Mia is about to call a fingerprint search so, thought I'd come this way to hide. - [Sean] Okay, this leads down to the river, so we'll go-- - [Zander] Cool, yeah, I'll come with you. - [Kasey] Okay, wait for me. - Why did no one think just to toss him in here? That would've been the easiest solution, right? - I'll remember that next time I've got a dead body on my hands. (loud screeching) What the fuck was that? - A fox. - What? - You've never heard one before? I hear them all the time when I'm coming home after a late shift. - Yeah, but that is a creepy fucking fox. (loud screeching) - Sounds like a girl screaming. - Listen to it. You hear how the sound stays the same? People don't scream like that. (loud screeching) (ominous music) - Wait guys, what is that? - [Kasey] Zan, be careful! - It'll be fine, it'll be fine, I've got it, I'll be right back. - [Kasey] Zan! - [Sean] Are you all right? - Fucks sake! - [Kasey] Zan are you okay? - I'm fine! I've got it. - Good. Now come back. - Do you think this is Louis' shoe? - Like I can remember what shoes he had on. - Well it has to be, right? - Well then how'd it get all the way over here? - What is that? - Nothing, just a piece of twig, come on, let's get you back to the house before you die of hypothermia. - You go, I'll keep looking. - Oh no you don't. It'll be dark soon, you'll be no use to anyone out here in the pitch black. - Yep, and you don't want to be eaten up by that evil witch ghost either, so come on. - Not now that we have a zombie to contend with. Oh, don't hug me! Stop, God, stop it! - What happened to you? - Decided to go for a little swim, didn't you Zan? - Any sign of Louis? Maybe if we look tomorrow morning? - Okay. - Is there any point? - Well he's gotta be around here somewhere. (gentle piano music) So what about down there? - Where? - Did you check there? - [Zander] Yeah, yeah, right there, I did, yeah. - There's someone in the house! Louis? You're here? - Mia, I don't think anyone's here. - It has to be. - Look, you could've see me, I was up here. - It wasn't you, someone else was behind you. - I didn't see anyone. - Well I know what I saw. - Look, Mia, I know you want Louis but this is getting ridiculous now. - Someone was up here, I swear to God. - Are you sure it wasn't Reese? - Yeah, yeah, maybe it was a reflection, or I don't know, maybe-- - Why don't you believe me? Someone was here, Louis was up here. - Are you sure it was Louis? - It was just for a second, but it has to be. - Mia I'm just saying, if it was Louis, why would he hide from us? - Look. I know how much you want to find Louis, we all do. But he's not here. - Then someone else is in the house. We have to go. - Wait, wait, wait, you can't be serious. - We have to leave. We have to leave now. - Wait, wait. We'll search the house. We'll see if anyone's here, okay? - [Mia] No, we have to go. - And go where? Okay, that painting is useless without Eddie, we can't just leave-- - We could just grab it and leave. - We're staying. Okay, you can go if you want, but that painting is staying right here. I'm not running off just because you've freaked yourself out. - Okay, okay, wait, wait, wait, Mia, they are right, we can't leave. We'll search the house, we'll go room to room. - Will that make you happy? - It's not about me being happy. - But if we search the house and there's no one here, will you agree to stay? - Fine, we'll do it your way. - All right, cool, okay, you guys stay here. Sean and I will check the bedrooms. - Well no, no, no, we should be sticking together, it's gonna be safer. - Yeah but this way, you can keep an eye on the stairs, and that will stop the risk of anyone getting past us. - All right, well can we start with my room? I want to put some dry clothes on. - Come here. (ominous music) It's gonna be fine. (loud screeching) - Guys, come on, get out, I've gotta change. - Okay. See ya. Right, that's just-- Lots of places to hide up here. (soft, frightening music) - [Reese] Nothing? - No. What exactly is their plan if they do find someone? - Depends who it is, I guess. - There's no one here. - You said we'd look properly. - You know I'm right. - No one. - Happy now? - Come on, let's get you a drink. - I'll check downstairs. (soft, ominous music) (loud screeching) Oh hey, wait, question. What is French for, thank you for the help with the search? - You were out looking for a dead guy. There's gotta be a Chinese proverb about futility in there somewhere. - Yeah but, it beats sitting around here doing nothing. Besides, what if Mia is right? What if he's out there? - He's dead, I was there. I saw how much blood he lost. - All right, so how would you explain what's going on? - Either it was a wild animal-- - No, because when I suggested that you all laughed at me. - Or something moved him. (mischievous music) - But who? - Exactly. Now I was in my room all day, so for all I know, any one of you could have slipped out. - But Mia and I were down here the whole time. - Of course you wouldn't be lying about that-- - No, I wouldn't be lying about that, why would anyone be lying? - Because all bets are off now. We fucked up, the second Louis got shot, the plan changed. - Okay, so, so we take the cars and we hop on the next ferry. We could be home by this time tomorrow, right? - Not without Eddie. - Yeah but we don't need him. - Do you know how to sell a stolen painting? - You win, how do we actually know he's even coming? You know, like you just said, the whole game changed. - He has to. 'Cause if he doesn't, we're fucked. - [Kasey] What? What do you want? - Do you trust the others? - Of course I do. - Even now, after everything that's happened? - We don't know anyone else's-- - Reese took the guard's gun. Did you know that? - What? - He tried hiding it from us. - How do you know? - Because I found it. - You took it? - Well I didn't want to just leave it. - Oh, so you thought it would be a good idea just to take it. - He tried hiding it from us in the first place. - Why would you take it? You don't know how to use a fucking gun. - I don't trust him with it. - You are like a dog with a bone, I swear to God. - I can't just sit downstairs knowing he has a weapon stashed up here. - You need to let this go, okay, I can handle him. - I'm just trying to protect us. - Sean there is no us. (soft piano music) Mia, you in here? - [Mia] Up here. - What are you doing up there? - [Mia] Nothing, just sitting. - Brought you some tea. - Thank you. You all think I'm a liar, don't you? - Of course we don't. I just know how badly you want to find him. - We should have never gone to him, if he hadn't-- - None of this would've been possible without him. Those CCTV tapes would've been the end of us. - Still, I'm the one who got him involved. I'm the one who picked him. He was always so kind to me. I remember, the first time we met, me and my dad had just had this massive argument and he found me outside in the car park. He told me that he and his dad used to have shouting matches too, but that I was louder than any of them. (gentle music) I knew it'd be easy to persuade him to join us. - You cannot blame yourself, this was his choice. - What if he's still out there? - [Kasey] You can't think like that. - Do you really think, I mean, that he was-- - I'm sorry. - What if we're wrong? What if he's still out there? - I helped Reese put him into that car. And even then, he just wasn't there anymore. I wish I was wrong, but there was no way he could've survived that. (sobbing softly) - He must have been so scared. And it's all my fault. - It might be a better idea to keep a watch on the house, than the road. - [Reese] Mia's just feeling guilty. - We're all responsible. - [Reese] Some of us are more responsible than others. - You were all in favor of this stupid heist even before the facts, and now, you can't stop shifting the blame. Do you know what your problem is Reese? You always want what you can't have, and the second you get something you don't want it anymore. - Sean, leave it. - No, he should hear this. Do you know what you are Reese? You're a coward, always too scared to try. - Yeah? And what does that make you? - A man who gets what he wants. - [Zander] Where are you going? - [Reese] Out. - What's going on? - Nothing. - [Kasey] There you are. - Didn't realize you were looking for me. - What are you doing out here? - I just needed some air. - Are these yours? You are unbelievable. - Kasey, they're not mine. - After everything you said to me? All those promises you made? - I swear to God they're not mine. - Oh, then whose are they, huh? You're the only one out of us who smokes, never mind specific brand. Jesus Reese, you're so full of shit. - Kasey please-- - You knew how much it meant to me. After everything I watched my mom go through and my dad powerless to help, you really didn't mean a single fucking word, did you? - I don't know how they got there, if you just let me-- (frightening music) - [Kasey] The fuck are you doing? - [Zander] Eddie, thank Christ. - It's not him. - [Zander] What, then who is it? - I've no idea. - Shit, fuck, what if it's the police? - Doesn't look like the police. Where the fuck is Eddie? - Go out and talk to him. - What? - It's your house, right? So you have nothing to hide. Go out and see who it is. - What am I meant to say? - Anything, just get him to go away. - Go on. (soft, suspenseful music) - Who the fuck are you? - I was going to ask you the same question. - What are you doing here? - I live here, what's your excuse? - I know the owner, he's a mate. - [Mia] He's not here, you better go. - Now wait a second, I've driven all this way, I promised Layla I'd take her somewhere nice. - You better take her somewhere else. You're trespassing. - No, no, no, wait a second. Charles said this place was empty. What the hell are you doing here? I think you're the one trespassing. Look, you let me get on with my business, and I'll leave you to yours. No one needs to know, all right? - Leave now. - Layla, come on babe! - Stop! - What's going on? - [Mia] He wouldn't listen. - All right mate, don't worry. I'm not here to interrupt your little party. - If I were you, I'd listen to when a lady says no. - Like I said to your bird, I don't give a shit who you are. See, I know the owner, and he lets me stop over when I'm in the area, and I was in the area, so here I am. - She gave you a chance to leave, remember that. - Just get out of the fucking way. Whoa, fucking hell, boy! - Turn around, and drive out of here. - Have you fucking lost it? - Do it while you still can. (intense, suspenseful music) I said leave! - All right, all right, fucking hell! Your man's mental, you know that? - [Mia] Just leave! - All right, I'm going. But I'd be careful around him if I were you. - Where the hell did you get that? - Ask Reese. (car engine growls) - You stole it. - [Sean] You shouldn't have hid it. - Why did anyone have a gun? - What were you gonna do with it? - I've just saved us from that asshole, you should be thanking me. - What if he comes back? - Then I'll sort him out for real. - Oh Christ, listen to yourself. - Give it to me. - Fat chance. - I'm serious Sean. - So am I, okay? You don't get to be the one in charge anymore. How do we even know you're telling the truth about Louis? How do we know that you didn't do him in? - What the fuck are you on about? - No one else saw it happen, and with him gone, we all get a bigger cut of the money, don't we? - An idea which was originally yours, if I remember. - I'm greedy, what can I say? But we know that I didn't kill anyone. - Can both of you calm the fuck down? - You want to ask questions, yeah? You want to ask questions? Who moved Louis? Because I was in my room all day, where were you? - Fucking Kasey, if you must know. - Stop it, Sean. - [Sean] Funny, that's not what you were saying earlier. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, I think we all need to take a minute here. - When we get back to England, I want you out. You can go back to your mom, if she'll fucking take you. Fuck you! - Fine, you don't ever need to see me again. Once I get my money, I'm gone. - You're all unbelievable. The whole point of that stupid plan was to change our lives. - Yeah, well, things are definitely different now. (soft piano music) - You have impeccable taste in men. - [Kasey] Yeah, just Zander left and I've got the full set. - Mia wouldn't speak to you ever again. - [Kasey] Best not then. - You know I didn't have anything to do with Louis. You believe me? - I don't know what to believe. I just want to go to bed and wake up weeks from now. - This whole thing was a mistake. - Do you mean the painting, or? - [Sean] What the hell are you doing? - [Zander] Look, I was just gonna move it. - Why the hell would you do that? - I can see where this is headed, you know? You and Reese, one more wrong word, and one of you's gonna snap, so I just, just thought I'd put it somewhere safe. - I see. (ominous music) - Look, I thought that way, you'd both have to sit and wait out for Eddie and not take matters into your own hands. - And that's exactly what you're doing, isn't it? - Fuck off. - Jesus, Zan, it's only me. - Yeah, I know. - I don't think the others would take too kindly to know what you're doing. - And yet you haven't shouted for any of them, so. - I was hoping we could sort this out between ourselves. - Can you explain to me why exactly you're up here? (car engine growls) - Shit! (suspenseful music) Police are outside! - What? - Get the lights! - What are they doing here? - [Sean] Get down! (soft thumping) - The doors, are they locked? (suspenseful music) - [Kasey] What's going on? - [Reese] Police! (gravel crunches softly) (banging on door) (shouting in French) (banging on door) (shouting in French) (banging on door) - Do you think that drunk bastard called them? - Why did Sean have to go waving that gun around? - Okay we have to get out of here, screw Eddie. - He's gone around the corner. Fuck. Go, go, move! (frightening music) (muffled screaming) - Stop moving. - [Zander] Sean! - Quit moving. I'm gonna take my hand away, all right? Don't make a fucking sound. - Jesus, what is the matter, we need to go. - No, no, no, no one is going to the police, okay? I've not come this fucking far to get arrested. (sobbing) - Mia. - Don't you fucking dare. (car engine growls) (soft sobbing) - [Kasey] No, no, no, Mia, what happened? - We need to go, we need to go. - [Kasey] Well who did this to her? - She was right, there's someone else here. - The police, why didn't you-- - I knew it was him, he wouldn't let me. - We have to go, right now. - [Zander] What about Mia? - We have to leave her. - [Reese] What? - Right now, we have to go. - Not without the painting. - What are you fucking kidding? - [Kasey] She's dead because of it, I'm not just gonna leave it here. - [Reese] It's upstairs. - [Kasey] So let's go get it. - No fucking way, I'm not going up there, no. - Okay. Reese, take Zander and get the car. Kasey and I will meet you outside with the painting. Okay? - Move. (ominous music) Stand watch. - Halfway there. (car engine squeals) - Come on, come on, come on! No, no, no, please, please! - No, no, no, what's going on, what's going on? - Get the engine, get the engine. - No, no I'm not going out there. (car engine squeals) Fuck. (heavy breathing) (loud thud) (screams wildly) - Oh fuck! (frightening music) (ragged breathing) - No one. There's nothing to worry about. We give this painting to Eddie, and he'll let us go. - Let us go? Wait, Eddie's here? Oh, you're helping him? (suspenseful piano music) - Kasey, open the fucking door. (pounds loudly) Kasey! Fuck! (glass shattering) (ominous music) - Oh fuck, fuck. (frightening music) (soft pounding) - [Reese] Kasey! Kasey, Kasey! - Reese, Reese, we have to get out of here! - There's someone out there, he got Zander. - I know, I know, Sean might be working with him. - What? - Come on, we have to go! (muffled shouting) - [Kasey] Whoa, whoa, whoa, please, please, please. - Shut the fuck up, shut the fuck up! - Please just let him. Eddie, no, please. - Where's the painting, Kasey? Where's the fucking painting? - [Kasey] Please just let him go! (screaming) (frightened gasp) - Don't make me ask you again. - Okay, okay. It's in the kitchen. (suspenseful music) (breathes heavily) - You check that way. - Kasey! Just come out. We only want the painting. Kasey I swear to God! (struggled grunting) Don't you fucking move. Where's the painting? I know you've hidden it somewhere. - Go fuck yourself. (gun clicks) I told you you didn't know how to use a fucking gun. (pained shout) (coughs) (breathes heavily) (suspenseful music) - [Eddie] Fuck! Sean! Where the fuck are you? (suspenseful music) - [Kasey] Fuck. (frightening music) - Bitch! (Kasey screams) No, no, no, no, no, no. No, no. The fuck have you done? (grunts softly) (suspenseful music) (loud thud) (giggles maniacally) (soft thud) - Kasey. (gentle music) - [Kasey] Are you okay? - No. You? - No. - I was so scared you'd, is Sean? - Come to France, you said. It'll be fun, you said. - Well let's never listen to a word I say ever again, okay? - Deal. Oh fuck. - The painting. - Just leave it. - But you can't just-- - I thought we weren't listening to you anymore? - After everything? - It doesn't matter. (gentle piano music) - [Reese] What's French for take us to a hospital? - [Kasey] I think he'll get it. (speaking in French) (mischievous music)
