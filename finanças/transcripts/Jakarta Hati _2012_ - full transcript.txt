PRESENTS Your wife is having an affair with my boyfriend. So it's your boyfriend who ruined my marriage? Why didn't you keep an eye on your boyfriend? But who's the married one here? I'm not surprised that your wife left you. Dar. My wife is obsessed with buttons. We got them from his favorite store. She always says, "Buttons are symbols." "They symbolize how big things are controlled by small things." "Small things matter," she says. This. She always resews my buttons. Even though none of them are loose. Sometimes I don't even understand what she means. Is your boyfriend a barber? Is he obsessed with hair? Does he want to have his own barbershop? I cut his hair. Simple. I never liked long hair. It looks messy, gross. But he said... "Long hair does not equal messy." And that it was his statement about the world. He said I'm too scared to make statements about my surroundings. My feelings about long hair, is a statement about my surroundings? Or is that him making the statement that he's against me? This is my favorite place. I always say, all the dirt in Jakarta will get cleaned here. My wife said I'm too serious. I'm too critical. And? Where does people's dirt get cleaned? Does it become other people's business too? What do you think... our partners... I mean, what do you think they talked about when they were... Did they talk about us? I bet they talked about us. I can imagine what my wife would say. My husband gets sweaty easily. Too much. Honestly, I'm sweaty all the time. I get sweaty easily. I can imagine it too. Imagine what? Me getting sweaty? No, no! I can imagine what he would say. He would say... "My girlfriend never appreciates me." Yeah. "She never appreciates my paintings." One day... I came back from the gym. The water was off at the gym. No water in the whole place. Okay, I do love paintings. But it doesn't give him the right to force me to paint too. I was about to go home. I was leaving, and I saw my wife standing there. She was holding a batik shirt and black pants. Why? Apparently there was a wedding. She forced me to attend a wedding. I didn't even get to take a shower. One day, when we were at his house, there was a painting, I think it was just finished. I touched it. It was wet and I got paint on my finger. He yelled at me, he was furious. What was worse, when I went with him to a gallery. Finally we went to the wedding and everybody starred at me because I was drenched in sweat. This time the painting was dry. It should be okay if I touch it, right? I was tempted to touch it, and I did it. I looked at him. He wasn't mad. He was quiet. But his face, I knew he was really upset with me. And where was my wife? Five meters in front of me. She didn't want to be next to me. Not at all. He looked at me with an unpleasant look. So I kept looking at the painting. I touched it and touched it. And then a security guard came over to me. "Please don't touch the painting," he said. I said, "But there's no sign or warning here." "Yes, there is, Ma'am. Up there." "Yes, Sir." She didn't want to be near me because she was embarrassed. And silly me, why did I follow her at that time? That was mean. I wanted to apologize. I turned, but he wasn't there. Where was he? Apparently he was all the way by the entrance, waiting for me. I went to him. I asked him, "Why did you leave me?" And he said... "I'm embarrassed." "I'm embarrassed to have you as a girlfriend." So... which one is the third person in our relationship? Is it them? Or us? You know what? My wife and I really love mussels. Mussel are an aphrodisiac. But the funny thing is, she doesn't want to have kids yet. Right? And here's the best part. You know what? I bought... The last time I bought condoms was four months ago. And now I know where all of her desire went. Damn woman. I love mussels too. - But he never allows me to eat them. - Why? I think it was intentional. Because lately... we've hardly kissed. We've become the third person. We're not in the place where we belong. Have we become the third person? Do you really have to ask that? Do you still need an answer to whether or not we're the third person? I was just about to leave now. God willing, I won't be late. DO NOT ENTER RESIDENTS ONLY - Why are you looking at me like that? - Oh, my gosh. I'm sorry, Mr. Marzuni. I didn't recognize you. Because you're usually in a car with dark windows. I'm sorry. Scooter. Where's your scooter? Take me to the taxi place. Yes, Sir! I'm sorry but my scooter was confiscated by the dealer. I bought it last Eid in installments, to impress my future in-laws. Sorry, Sir. You want me to get you an ojek? - Do you know where to get one? - Yes. - Take me there. - I have to wait until Edi's shift starts. It's okay. - Just leave it. - Yes, Sir. -That way -Yeah. Come on. Where's the ojek? There's nothing here. I'm sorry, Mr. Marzuni. I forgot. The ojek base camp in here was closed permanently two days ago. Because people used it for drinking and gambling. I'm sorry. Where are you going, Sir? Now that's not my fault. As you also know, this door has been locked for a while. It's to stop the outsiders from coming in. The key for the door, where is it? Where's the key? I don't know. This door has been locked for so long. Give me a hand, will you! Damn. Here. Yes, Sir! - Where to? - Senayan. Bad traffic. Sorry. Senayan, okay? I'm sorry, the AC is not cold. The freon is low. It's all right. Which route do you want to go? Just avoid the traffic. Jakarta nowadays, there's traffic everywhere, Sir. Find a short cut, through the side streets. There's roadworks in Semanggi. Traffic everywhere. Aren't you the driver? Find the best route then. What matters to me is that I get there on time. Period. If everybody thought that way, I would be in trouble. You want a regular citizen like me to solve the traffic? What else after that? - That's hard. - Hello. Yeah, yeah. - What else after this? - I'm in a taxi. - To solve the problems with the law? - Yes, yes. Yes. My car is broken. It's difficult being a citizen now. Living a hard life, being oppressed all the time. Not the DBM. The documentation. - Just like a snake. - God willing, I'll be there. It's people like us that must be held accountable. Meanwhile, those people get money from here and there. Spread a poison everywhere. - Corruption or whatever... - You're a taxi driver. Don't act like you know everything about social problems and things. What do you think is this? A movie? Stop talking. Just drive. Idiot! This morning, my wife and kids came to the gate to see me off before I went to work. - Yeah, me too. - They prayed that I had a blessed day. Not to get scolded by an arrogant man like you! My side job is a taxi driver, I'm also a teacher! Get out. What? - Get out? - Get out! - Get out! - Don't you know I'm a member of the House? Get out! Get out! Those people in Senayan must have gone crazy. The budget for the toilets is two billion? Just for toilets! My toilet is pretty. My well is smooth. Just like my coffee. A smooth well, huh? For the toilet they work fast. Because it's for them. Imagine if it was for people like us. Our business is in the toilet, and their business is in that big building. Is there tax for this cigarette? Maybe there's a tax for this ketchup too. But the tax money goes to them. They share the money among them. Or they use it to build the toilet. If there's still some money left, they will go abroad with their family. And then they pretend to get insomnia. Just like the TV series. You mean amnesia? - Amnesia. - Amnesia. The TV series is better, because the actors are good looking. Peace be upon you. And unto you peace. Listen, guys. About the toilet, it's not a decision of the members of the House of Representatives. You're wrong. I have to clarify that. It's the decision of BANGAR. BANGAR. You got it? You don't know what BANGAR is? Budgeting division. So it's different, totally different. I'm a member of the House of Representatives. I know what the problems are. - Got a lighter? - Here. Light up your cigarette. I'm talking here. Thief! Thief! Have mercy! I'm just hungry! Just strangle him! I know this kid! I have three siblings! We haven't eaten since yesterday! - Shut your mouth! - That's enough! Give me that! You're lucky. Give my wallet back. Give it to me. You polish shoes. Isn't that right? Now go home. Get your equipment. You polish the shoes of these guys. Give this money to him later. This is not right! You! Come here! Here. - Take this money. - Take it? Give it to this boy later. - The money? - Yes, to pay him. Now go. I'm one of the people of Senayan. You're wrong if you think that I only care about myself. Now listen. - Is anyone willing to drive me to Senayan? - Me, me. - Huh? - I will. You? Are you sure? - Should I get my scooter now? - Yes, go get it. I'm taking an ojek now. God willing, I will get there faster. - I'll wait for you here. - You will do that? - Yes. - That's awesome. -Hold this -Got it. My bag. - Wait for me, okay? - Got it. Good morning, Sir. You can't park here. Why? I'm taking an important person here. A member of the House of Representatives. He said he has a meeting. - In here? - Yes, he's a government official. I don't understand his job. - Let me park here, okay? - Okay. Thank you. The hero is always the last to come. Old man! I don't need to switch to golf like you guys, my dear respected gentlemen. You're still wearing that, you want to show off? That's silly, and really dangerous. Where are the files? Has it ever crossed your mind? If I dress like that, I mean like that, the security in my cluster don't recognize me. I seek forgiveness from Allah. Why didn't he recognize me? He said when I'm in the car, he couldn't see my face through the dark windows. My car is broken so I took a taxi. And the driver... Such a smarty pants. - Criticizing this and that... - Enough, enough. If you want to make a boring speech like this, I will get a loud speaker for you. This is serious. Serious! - Yes, this is serious. - Come on! Zun, whatever enlightenment you're getting, it's too late. If you don't give us the files of the calculation, you're still involved in this. Zun, when we first gathered, and the moment you were assigned as treasurer, you should understand it. What's wrong with you? You don't mind if you get caught? You won't have money for your family if you get locked up in jail. You want that? Knock on wood. Zun. Your wife, Rina, has been diagnosed with a tumor. - And if you have to go to... - Go where? Go to jail? And then, what about your problem with the tax people? But you know, someone took away my money. What are you waiting for then? I can't wait for too long. If you refuse to give us the file, we would deny you being part of this. It would cost you your image, your reputation, your future. Here. How is it? How is it? Huh? Zun was just playing with us. You're good, Bro. Zun, you should know this, we just wanted to claim what belongs to us. Three decades we've been fooled. The 1998 tragedy? Are you kidding me? - The kidnapper and the victims... - From the same party. We didn't get anything. - But now is the time. - Freedom! Okay, okay, okay, okay. Zun, here. Take that. To lubricate. To pay for your enlightenment today. Take that. Go ahead. What? - Peace be upon you. - And unto you peace. Zun, Zun. - Zun. - Your collar. Who cares. Don't think about it too much. It's not good for your health. Old man. It's nice. From which comparative study? - The one in Australia. - Not the one in Greece? I bought a house from the one in Greek. Kin! Kin! That kid usually hangs out at the cemetery in Menteng Pulo. Maybe he lives here. - Get in! - Sir! I was framed! - Get in! - Let go of me! Drugs? He stole a book in Gramedia. There must be a political reason behind it! I'm an activist! - Let go of me! - Shut up! Let go of me! Officer! Bana, the iPads, the exhibits, you have them? - 50? - 52. I think it looks good if we make it 50. That's a nice number. It's such a waste if we have to destroy them with a tractor. Wouldn't it be better if you keep one and I get one too? For my brother. He keeps asking for an iPad. He got sad, because all of his friends have an iPad. I was just asking. Excuse me. Don't push me. Relax, okay? I can walk. Sit down. Get his police investigation report. Bana. BAP, his report. 372 and 378. Defrauding women with an arisan scheme. The amount is 85 million. 20 women filed a report on him. Take care of it. I have to get going. We have a demonstration in Casablanca. - What demonstration? - Land eviction. Your full name? You forget your father's name? It's been only five years. - It's not that long. - This is a BAP process. Follow the procedure. Are you okay? You're doing it to your family. I can be professional. Have a seat. Amazing. You're still trying to be consistent. - I think I did a good job... - Your name! I won't be going anywhere. Neither will you. So please sit down and tell me your name. Okay. Burhan Arifin. Address? Usually, when we stare at each other like this, your mother would break us apart. How is she? Address? Your current address. Cempaka Putih Barat. RT... 12. RW 5, number 6C. - Is that by the shops? - Yes! - You still remember that? - Yes! The place we bought your bicycle. Is everything okay? That's not even 10 kilometers from our house. I can explain. I can explain... But, not here. Okay? I know. I know. Your mother is still looking for me. I will handle everything, I will pay everything. But, please, please not in here. In our house maybe, okay? Can you tell me the chronology of this cheap scam? That whole report was based on misunderstanding. I can put in the report that you're not cooperating during the investigation. I can send this case to the attorney. They will proceed to move it to the courts. This is a misunderstanding, I didn't scam anyone. Why? My initial intention was good. I helped those women. I empowered them. Can you be more specific? Any names? In this report, it clearly says that Mrs. Ida... Yes. If you think that name sounds familiar to you, you're right. She's our neighbor. Rumor has it she's a mistress of a government official. Please focus on your case, be cooperative. It was Ida. She started it. She asked me to join this business. It was her. She also allowed me to manage her money. Everything is a mess now, because she... She got jealous. Are you telling me that this case is about a love story? No. This is pure business. She's the one with the problem. She's hallucinating. The report clearly says that you promised Ida you'd marry her. You see, Bana? You know your father. I'm all about helping people. But people always misunderstand me. People? People or women? Your eyes. You have my eyes. I'm glad it's only your eyes. God was kind to me. I never taught you to act cynical like that. There are a lot of things that you never taught me. Can we continue? You never understand. You will never understand. Okay. We have started it, so we will end it here. I never promised anything to Ida. Not even to marry her. How many members in that arisan group? I don't know. Ida knows. She's the administrator, not me. How much is the monthly fee? I don't know. Ida handled that. Hold on one second. I missed something. How long have you known Ida? Well you know... I'm sorry. It's been a while, 10 years. But we've been close for about 5 years. Are you two engaged in a romantic relationship? Yeah, in the beginning, yes. I made a mistake. You want to know about it, huh? What I want to know is the information about this case. Yeah, whatever. But that's the fact. I... I made a mistake. I left our house. I was a coward. Can I ask for one thing? If you say I have to spend a night here... can you not confiscate this robot? Please send the robot to this address. Please. Why? There's... There's a four-year-old boy waiting there and... tomorrow is his birthday. Your son? - Is there a problem? - The usual one. He keeps on rambling. Try to finish before 5:00 p.m., because they will have a rotating blackout. Dad? Yes. He's your little brother. Not from Ida. That's the mistake I made. That's why I can't go home and look your mom in the eye. So that boy is a mistake? Am I a mistake too? And you're the only one who's right? You're not a mistake. Dion is not a mistake either. His name is Dion, the name that you wanted for a brother. I remember, every Ramadan you always prayed... that you would give everything, your comic books, toys... for a brother. If this is not what God wants to stop my hideous habit, maybe... maybe it's an improper coincidence by nature. Whatever it means, I know. I understand. Where did you buy the robot, Dad? In Slipi. In the mall? No. The store outside. A street vendor? Is that why they didn't wrap it? Two weeks ago I was one of the officers who relocated the street vendors. Not outside the mall building. Inside it, in the mall there's... The box was broken. Do you always visit on his birthday? Yes. Ida makes sure that... Dion's mom passed away during labor, so Ida raised him. Dion doesn't live with you? No. I... BAP's done. Now, Bana,... you get to decide. How Dion's birthday is going to be this year. Ask him to sign it. Send it to the attorney for further processing. Prepare a cell. He will use it. - I'm going to leave for a minute. - Yes. Peace be upon you. Mom. Please make more opor ayam. I'm going now to buy some chicken. I have good news for you. Where is it? People line up. A bamboo stick with a red and white flag tied on it was held tight by... - What's up, David? - You're asking me? You're not a busy man. Well, my tummy is busy. You're funny. - And my wallet seems to be empty too. - Life of a writer. Seems like we need something to refresh you. - My main tool for work is my mind. - Have you thought about it? Have you thought again about it? Please, don't tell me we're still talking about it. Of course we are still talking about it. You're not done yet. Your argument was weak. Once you talked about professionalism, you didn't have a valid argument. And now you need money. - My statement was clear. - Clear what? Your argument was weak. - Bro, Bro... - What? Listen. - What I sell is my integrity, right? - Yes. And then? If I sell it for the movie... What's the title of it? "The Impotent Pocong" Why are you being skeptical? Let me tell you the concept. - This is satire. - No, I don't need to hear that. Hearing the title is already making my mind blunt. You're an editor who refused to work on the movie called "A Waiter's Temptation." - And now you're saying this? - Don't talk about that. I refused it because of the producer. He's just a little kid who didn't know what he was doing. And this one is better? - Is that what you're saying? - Of course. The producer is consistent. He produces all genres. His passion is to keep the industry alive. What industry are you talking about? The movie industry that no one even believes in? - What's wrong with you? - People like him are ruining the industry. You can't be ignorant like that. You're the one who told me anyone can make movies. And he wants to work with you. You need to emphasize this. Forget about the taste. You told me taste is too elitist. No measurement, no standard. Yes, I said that. But I didn't say the ritual should be like this. - With a different faith. - Come on. Listen. When did you last write? When was the last time I saw your name, Firman S, on a movie poster? It's been about five years. And I'm worried. Braja will be in a higher grade. The new school year will start soon. You told me the balance in your bank account is below zero degrees Celsius. You sold your car and you can't even afford to fix your broken TV. Your laptop is also dead now. I still survive. - I'm even writing now... - What? Your masterpiece? About politics in Indonesia through the point of view of a street sweeper, who was born during the era of Suharto? - With the fairy-tale structure? - Yes. - That one? - Yes. Isn't that cool? Why is it so hard for you to admit that it will become a masterpiece? This is the one that's going to change my life. - Change the industry. - Okay. I'll ask you a simple question. When will your masterpiece be done? When is the deadline? When? Well... Actually I'm in the middle of writing now. I was in the middle of my creative process when you suddenly called. What if I called you while you were doing your editing? You would feel annoyed, right? - And I hope you have... - My wife is in the hospital. Yes. Admitted to the hospital. - When? - This morning. Pregnancy bleeding. - And the baby? - I don't know yet. So far it's fine. But if the bleeding gets worse... I don't know. Do you remember the money you borrowed to pay the alimony for Ratih? Yes. But you know my situation now. And you also know I can't ask anyone else. You know how my relationship with my in-laws is, with my dad. And I still haven't received payment from my job, it's still in the filming process. That's why I'm asking you to please take this job. Call the producer, okay? He's waiting for your answer today. Please, Firman. The doctor is here. Okay? Please. Do me a favor. Dad, we have to go to ITC to buy a gift. HIS CONTACT NUMBER. JUST IN CASE YOU FORGOT TO SAVE IT. Dad, let's go. Hold on, hold on. Wait a minute. Come here first. What is it? Why? What gift? It's my friend's birthday. This afternoon. We have to buy a gift. But wait. I'm working now. I'm writing. When do you have to finish it? Tomorrow? My friend's birthday party is today, this afternoon, in two hours Who is this birthday friend of yours? Syailendra. You don't know him, why did you even bother to ask? - And you have to bring a gift? - This is a birthday, not a circumcision. Even for a circumcision, you have to give some money. Don't buy anything expensive, okay? Hello, Miss? This is Firman. Yes, that's right. Oh, you still remember the title? So what do you think? The tittle is too common? Really? Listen to me. Listen. Last time I only sent you the synopsis. What do you think if I send you the draft? I'm doing it now. Of course, as soon as possible. As soon as possible. But please read it, okay? All right. Thank you. Let's go. Hello, Dung. Are you busy? Hello? Hello? - Dad. - Wait, wait. Hurry up, or we'll miss the bus. Phone credit, 50,000. - I will get the credit right away, right? - Depends on the connection. - What if it's like last time? - The connection is good so far. - Are you sure? - Yes. - Hello, David? - Any news? I'm working on it. I'm waiting for my phone credit to go through. I just bought it. Hang in there. I know you know my situation. Yes, David. Dad, come on. - Firman. - Rozak. Where are you going? Do you need a ride? - To ITC. - It's all right. - We're taking public transport. - It's okay. Come on, get on. I still owe you some money from three days ago. You look confused? Maybe cause you write too many stories. And now you forgot. Okay. Come on. Helmet. Yes, I'm doing it now. I'll go to internet cafe after this. -Over there, Dad -Don't worry. You go and look. I'll wait here. Phone accessories? Sir, phone accessories? We have phone cases. It's only 10,000. Come on, Sir. We have discount too. We have hair brushes too. For your hair. Your hair looks a little messy. We have hairbands too, small purse for your phone. Come on. Get it while it's cheap. Sorry. - Are you from Pemda, local government? - Pardon? You're from Pemda, right? - Pemda? - Yes. You must be from Pemda. Him? I know he's a college student. The son of the porridge seller downstairs. And you must be from Pemda, right? I'm not from Pemda. I'm a writer and I'm trying to work here. Yeah, I know. You're writing about these vendors, right? They paid for their security and tax to me. - If you want your share, I can do that. - No, sorry. I'm a writer. - I'm not from Pemda. - I got you. - But not in here... - What are you talking about? Wait a minute! Can't you see I'm working? You want to see me writing? You want me to write on your face? Dad! You're ruining my mood. You got it? That one? Is this fake or original? - Miss? - The original wouldn't have Batman on it. Is that so? And Syailendra likes Batman too? Are you serious? This is supposed to be a gift for your friend. What's wrong with this? I like these sandals. I can't give someone something that I don't like. - Okay. How much? - They're 42,000. Dad. Can we buy this? Dad, where's Rozak? Call him, Dad. - What? - Call him. Let's take a bus instead. Come on. Dad. Braja. Why didn't you tell me your friend is from a rich family? Buy why, Dad? I better go inside. Okay. Go. - Excuse me, is this seat taken? - No. I'll borrow the chair then. Get out, get out. Get out. - I'm his friend! - Get out. - Why can't I enter the house? - You can't? What do you mean? Your son didn't bring the invitation. And I'm just doing my job. So without the invitation, you can't get in. - Please go. - You forgot to bring the invitation? Braja. Braja, look at me. Were you even invited? But he's the right defender in my soccer team. As a team captain, I have to come to my player's birthday. - Excuse me. - The magician is here. Braja! Braja! Braja. Sorry, I forgot to give you the invitation. I'm so sorry. Here. It's okay. Open it. You remembered. I need sandals for after soccer practice. Thanks, Braja. Let's go inside. I'm sorry, but my dad is kind of busy. All right. Thank you, Sir. YOU RECEIVED A 50,000 CREDIT. Hello. David. Hold on, David. Listen to me first. I won't call that guy, but I will go to him directly. I will bring all my scripts. That's what I can do. I'm doing it for you. - I will bring all my masterpiece... - I don't care. Whatever. I have so much going on now. Hello? David? You stay home. Lock the door. If you're hungry, there's noodles. If you need anything, call me. - Dad? - Yes? Where are you going? Hello? Mr. Prana? This is Firman, a friend of David's. Do you have time today? IN CASE OF FLOODING, PLEASE CONTACT... Ladies, gentlemen. Those who don't have electricity, please be careful with the candles. Don't place them on top of flammable material. Please be careful. Looks like there is a problem at the power station. What are you doing? The batteries in this flashlight are dead. Where's the candle? How would I know? Seriously? So the candle is my problem now? A woman's problem? You know what? We don't have gas. Is that a question or a statement? They say it's a megapolitan city. But the rotating blackout still exists. When the Muara Karang power station caught on fire, they said they needed spare parts from France. So what's the problem now? They even plan to raise the price of electricity. Not to mention the never ending traffic problem. And they're building flyovers everywhere, to make the traffic even worse. What's on their mind is money. Always trying to find a way to get more money. What are you talking about? If you have criticisms, don't say them in the bedroom. That's too comfortable. Say that to your office. You work in the bureaucracy office, right? Nothing's going to change if you talk about it here. Same thing with the posts on Twitter. What's the hash tag? #damnedmiddleclass What do you know about my job? About the middle class? Have you ever read Ben Anderson's books? Berger? Or maybe you should read Selo Soemardjan's book again. You're so annoying, oh gosh. Stop. A middle class house like ours won't add to the problem. It won't catch on fire. You don't even need to worry. The spark is not here anymore. What do you mean by that? Forget it. Just sleep. At this hour, I should've been sleeping. The batteries are low. Great. Somebody can't watch a soccer game. Hot, isn't it? You got stuck with your wife in the bedroom, and you can't sleep. Poor you. And you can't run to your novel either. The writing is too small and you can't read it now. Oh right, spare batteries. I forgot, I left them in my drawer at work. You look so restless. You didn't send a romantic text before bed tonight, huh? Or post "I miss you" on Twitter? Oh, you need to vent? "I'm stuck with my wife, no electricity and I can't sleep." Am I right? You may have deleted all the proof of your affair on your phone. But you don't think I know that? You don't think I can feel that? You don't think I notice, even though you put your phone on silent, you smile when you receive texts from her? Why don't you try and be sophisticated? You act cool on social media, but you can't hide your secret. That's what happens when you hang out with a teenager. What are you talking about? I know you're having an affair with Dian, your expert staff. Am I right? You work in the ministry of finance, but your expert staff are dentistry graduates. Leaving the scene. That's so typical of you. You leave when you're facing a problem. Typical. It's so you. Tell your cute girlfriend. If she wants to be flirty and vent to another woman's husband, be careful. I have ears everywhere. You don't think I know what's going on between you and Alex? Your senior manager? Are you baffled now? You're baffled that I know that? I've been noticing that you're glowing every time you come home after a late meeting. Shinier than with your blush on. FYI, after orgasm people will have some red tinge on the face. Next time, if you want to have sex with someone, don't do it right before checking out of a hotel. Why are you dating a middle-aged man still in puberty anyway? You think he acts that differently from a teenager? They're just the same. He's probably proud of himself for dating a younger woman. How was it? Was it good? Did you use... What do you call that new thing? Or did he still use Viagra for the vintage sensation? He's stronger and more understanding than you. You, who cheats on me with a little girl. At least she doesn't make me do foreplay. Foreplay is for you, so you can function. You didn't realize that? But she's more passionate than you. I know that you knew. I did expect you to know. If you knew, why didn't you say something? I told you, I know that you knew I was having an affair with Alex. And you. If you knew, why didn't you tell me sooner? We don't have electricity now. It's dark. And everything just came out. Is that the ring? Yes. Why didn't you take it? I want to ask you something. When you're with her, do you wear the ring? Do you, when you're with him? You're right. The spark no longer exists. No, you're right. We should've tried to have a baby a long time ago. When the power is back on, what are we going to do? Hello, Ma'am. Hurry up. Where's my dadar guling? You're nosy. It's still early. Be patient. Here. - What if it's like yesterday? - What about it? The shredded coconut tasted like grains of coffee. You're just too picky. We got a bad shredded coconut yesterday. But my dadar guling never fails. Try this one. This is the real Fatimah's dadar guling. You're my darling again now. You can become my lover too. You want that, Fatimah? Silly! Insane. I pray that your underwear will break off. This woman talks crazy. My life is already frustrating, having to drive a tow truck for a living. And now she wishes my underwear to break off. You two talk way too much. You want some to go? Of course. My kid will be upset if I come home in the morning and don't bring this. Fatimah's dadar guling. You're so fierce as a woman, Fatimah. Maybe you've been a divorcee for too long. You don't need to bring that up. What's wrong with me being a divorcee? Maybe you're just being weak and soft, just like my dadar guling. But at least my dadar guling is tasty. - Hi, Ma'am. - Hi, Fatimah. I need to buy snacks for tahlilan. - What do you think I should buy? - Get the brown apem. God willing, the sugar will ease the sorrow of the guests. How many do you want? Give me 25. - Here. Thank you. - You're welcome. Stop! Lady boy! He's running fast like a train! Let's go. The guy over there, he's the owner of the house that Fatimah rents. - Her hero is here. We better go. - We just got here, now we have to go. Here, my payment. Hi, Ayun. What do you want to buy? I have red snacks. Perfect for Chinese people's events. When will Bu Haji have another event? But her husband is dead. And we don't have pengajian nowadays. - When you have another event, buy from me. - Of course, Yuyun. So that's what you do after you did something wrong? You could barely walk. - What did I do wrong? The truth is... - Randy. Oh my God. You look so fresh this morning. - How are you? - I'm doing good, Fatimah. - Do you have dadar guling left for me? - Of course. For you, it's always available. The coconut here is very good. Here. Feed it to me, okay? Watch out, don't make a mess. Are you sure your hands are clean? But don't worry. Fatimah's snacks are hygienic. You don't need her to feed you. Your wife is waiting for you at home. Stop flirting. It tastes great. Next time just bring this to my store. We can talk more comfortably there. - More sterile too. Okay? - Yes. Do you want some to go? - Randy! - Sterile. What does he know about sterile? Silly Chinese! Come here! If you have a problem with me, stop glaring at me like that. Come here you! Can't you see? I was trying to close a deal with him. If I can sell my snacks in his store, everything is done, done. What do you mean? Do you think he's interested in your dadar guling? No, he's not. What he wants is you. Your body. Can't you tell that? I could smack you, you know? You've been absent for four days and now you come asking for trouble. If he's interested in my body, what's wrong with that? What's wrong? Fatimah, do you think you can find another man who would listen to you? I'm the only one who's willing to listen to all your complaints. Any other man would only last a night or two with you. - You're annoying. - Annoying? You missed me? What God has willed. Do you think I'm teenage girl? That teenage girl that keeps following you around. What's her name? Nancy. I know her name is Nancy. Just because her father is related to your father? Seriously, Fatimah. You need to put a sock in your mouth. You tell that girl, there's no other female who could stand to listen to your sister. Only me. I have a set of wide ears. Are you jealous of her? No way! Not in a million years! You're just exaggerating. Fatimah... Miss. Do you have the snacks that I ordered yesterday? Yes. I have prepared it for you. - Here's the money. - Thank you. Come on now. Stop pouting. It's useless. You better smile at me. I missed you. Bullshit! You missed me, you say? You missed me, but you hung out with Nancy. I saw you two in Atrium. Are you spying on me? My gosh, Fatimah. Nancy is like a sister to me. - Sister from Hong Kong! - Maybe she's from Hong Kong. Her father is Hong Kong Chinese. Even Yuyun is laughing. You're a coward! You're scared of your sister. They want you to marry Nancy. Shame on you! You can't even handle that? Maybe I should put tape over your mouth. Do you think I'm leaking, like the gas tank of your pick up truck? - I'll stop by your place later. - Okay. Just come to my garage! Fatimah. Stop pouting. I missed you. Missed who? Missed me? Missed my lips? My snacks? Or my body? Stop scratching! Or you will go bald! Fatimah, what do you want? Ayun. I'm a divorcee. If my family didn't disown me, do you think I'd be here selling snacks? I would be selling rugs in Pasar Baru, have a branch store in Mayestik. Or even better... I would sell nasi briyani in Kemang. And I'm getting old. And my mom, she keeps complaining. Because she hasn't got any grandchildren. What is it that you want, Ayun? You know it, Fatimah. I'm the only son in my family. Don't you worry. I will take care of everything. I will. But I need time. Take it slowly. What if we do it in a rush, and we fail? Am I right? -I want some apem -Oh, okay. - How many? - Give me 10,000 worth. - Thank you. - Yes. "Take it slowly." When you say that, what are you trying to say? I don't get it. Take it slowly... We do the "backstreet relationship." What God has willed, Ayun. You were blabbering here and there. But once you seemed to be confident, praise be to God, you want us to have a backstreet relationship. Why didn't you come here wearing a high school uniform? But watch out for the security. They might catch you, thinking that you're a lady boy. Damn! Why is it so hard to talk to you? Fatimah, can you please understand me? - Understand us. - Understand us? So you think it's my situation that put us in a difficult position? Now let me ask you something. Do you want us... to become "us"? Don't worry about Nancy. I will keep my distance from her. And I have a project with Koh Aliong. We'd tried to import Chinese scooters here. You saw it on TV, right? The fuel prices will go up. People are going crazy looking for affordable scooters. That would be so hectic. But don't you worry. I will stay away from Nancy. But, let's do it slowly. Okay? Bear with me. As you know, God is with those who are patient. Stop preaching. It doesn't suit your personality. If you want to preach, do it on TV. Like that feminine ustad. Give it to me. Give it to me! - Give you what? - What's your order? Don't tell me you came here without money for me. Give it to me. What took you so long! What is this? This is not your handwriting. You never got this many orders before. What is this? Ayun? Someone's getting married. Yes. I would know. I have wide ears. Nancy's brother. He asked me to help him. You just said you would keep your distance from Nancy. Keep your distance from her family. How are you going to do that? From here? You want me to help provide snacks to make your bond with them stronger? Are you insane? Just do what you think is good for you. Don't bother to listen to me. I guess I'm way too noisy for you. Excuse me, Ayun. I need to buy something. - Hi, Sari. - Yes, Fatimah. - You want apem? - Yes, 10. Okay. This apem is good. It can give you a feeling of peace in the morning. Fatimah, I want to buy that. How many? Oh, yeah. - Thank you. - Yes. Thank you. - Yes, Ma'am? - Where's the famous dadar guling? It's right here. Fatimah's dadar guling is always available. God willing, it's tasty. How many do you want? I want to buy a lot. My husband will come home today. Dadar guling is his favorite. God willing, after trying Fatimah's dadar guling, he will never leave home again. It has meat? It's dadar guling. 40,000. Thank you so much. - This boy! Didn't I tell you... - Just stop talking, will you? Read this. You feel it. Okay? MARRY ME, WILL YOU? NO NEED TO DO IT SLOWLY. I'M TELLING MY DAD NOW! Singkek! - Can I have it? - No! - This one? - No way! You have to buy it! - Stingy! - I don't care!
