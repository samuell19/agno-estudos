A NETFLIX ORIGINAL FILM [gentle piano music playing] [both giggling] [indistinct chatter] [María] This is the story of my last, biggest wish. A dream I want to share with my son. That's what this notebook is for. [wistful music playing] "This is the book Mommy Marie wrote for little Tomy." I hope he’ll learn how important it is to be true to yourself. And I want him to know his story. I just hope I can finish it. - [siren blaring] - [engine revving] [paramedic] Come this way, please. I'm sorry. Have a seat in the waiting room. They'll meet you there. Sure, okay. Uh, her bag... Thank you. Hey, Fede, I don't want to stay here. If the insurance guys don't listen, they'll have to give us a single room. Okay, but you need to call them and piss them off until they listen. I mean, a six-month treatment. That's gotta be worth a bed here. I'll call them and piss them off until they listen. - Really piss them off. - Okay. I will. - You talk to Tomy? - Mmm-hmm. He was just waking up. - Okay. - I told your dad I'd pick him up later. - Have you talked to the doctors? - Yeah. And? They said they're going to give you "tose" or "lactilose," I don't know. Something for bowel obstruction. So do I have to stay here? Until it takes effect, I guess. Yeah. Come on, Fede, do you think I'm an idiot? I'm not stupid. I lost my ovaries, not my brain. They won't keep me here just to see if I can take a shit. What? [upbeat guitar music playing] Okay... [María] The words "we have to talk" are always followed by something terrible, but never as terrible as that one time. I knew, two days after the surgery that removed my uterus, my ovaries, and some other things for analysis, that something was very, very wrong. But even the surgeon wouldn't tell me what it was. Everything feels more real and vivid when you're dying. You want to feel, taste and love. But, at the same time, the intensity is unbearable. A sick body can't handle it. And so you look for ways to escape, entertain, distract yourself. That's where social media comes in. Especially Twitter. You can argue for hours about pads versus tampons, sure. But you can also share what's happening with you. Having cancer is like having the flu. It's nothing to be ashamed of, it's just a thousand times worse. And I don't want to be someone who just talks about how long and painful their illness is. [keypad clicking] LONG AND PAINFUL, YOUR DICK. EXCEPT FOR THE LONG PART, OF COURSE. As soon as I posted it, I got so many messages of love, and... and from total strangers. Now, I don't want to offend anyone, but do you know what phrase I really hate hearing? "Everything's gonna be all right." All right my ass. Telling a cancer patient everything will be all right is like telling someone who's about to cross the desert that somewhere off in the distance, there's an oasis. - [Fede] He'll pick him up tomorrow. - Yeah. Okay, let's get you on the bed now. Nice and slow. Easy. You can lie back. Careful with your IV. Luis, would you get the control for her? Now, this button is to ask for some tea, to go to the bathroom, anything. And this one is for a dose of morphine. As soon as you feel any pain, ask for it. Don't wait until the pain is too strong. Just ask. Okay? Okay, call us if there's anything you need. Okay, thank you. - [nurse] See you soon. - [Fede] See you. So? Do you like your room? - It's nice, huh? - Mmm-hmm. It even has a view. What's out there? - [soft piano music playing] - Not much, really. Tell you the truth, it's shit. Are you sleeping here tonight? Yeah. And Tomy? Um... I took care of it. He goes to school with my mom or your dad. I'll pick him up, bring him here for a bit, and then take him back. - Are you gonna sleep in that chair? - Yeah. - They won't make you a bed? - [Fede chuckles] I'm getting a sleeping bag from Adrián. - They're gonna kick us out, I'm sure. - No, I'll hide it in the morning. They won't notice. - Federico? - Yes. How are you? Diego Vigna, chief physician of the hospital. - Yes, how are you? - Good. Not in my scrubs, but even on Sundays I come to visit a few patients. - Diseases don't take time off, right? - Right. I've just seen María, and I have updates on her situation. Uh-huh? No obstruction in the bowels. The pelvic tumor is pressing down on her duodenum. Since the indicators aren't good, I would suggest that María stay here with us. Because of her condition, we can't operate or continue her chemo. And what can we do? Well, we can work towards improving her quality of life. I can give her corticoids to regulate and control the tumor. Yeah. Doctor, that's all temporary. Are you telling me that nothing can be done? No, no, a lot can be done. You see, for me, reducing the pain she feels, that's important. We can also be with her, which is also important. Look, in these cases, I have two priorities, that the patient not suffer, and that they go home as soon as possible. Sending her home to wait is better. She'll be more comfortable. She'll be surrounded by her loved ones. [indistinct chatter on PA] [Tomy singing indistinctly] [Tomy humming] - [Tomy] These are the happy ones. - [Fede] I can almost feel that spider. - [Tomy] Because... - [Fede] Which was it, - the big one or the small one? - [Tomy] No. The small one. [Fede] Uh-huh. [Tomy] But it was really small. - [Fede chuckles] - Mommy! - [María] Hi, baby! - [Fede] Hi! [María] Oh! [kisses] - Hi! - [Fede] Aww, that's so sweet. Oh, look at you. [kisses] You good? How was school? [Tomy] My... Mom, I didn't... - I didn't go to school the other day. - Seriously? - [Tomy coughs] - Aww, but I'm so glad you came to visit. I'm gonna check out that school near our place. See if there are any more vacancies. [María] Careful, it's really high. [gentle piano music playing] This bed isn't like your bed at home, Tomy. It's like a robot. Yeah, lift it up for me. I need my feet right up high and my head down low. [exclaims] Good-bye! [exclaims] It's gonna bend me in half! [mock groaning] - [Fede] Whoa, whoa! - [Fede and María chuckling] Ciao! When I press this button here, it explodes. 'Cause there's a bomb that comes out of the sky and it explodes. Oh, good idea, Tomy. Let's blow up the bed. No, no, no, no! - [María mimics explosion and exclaims] - [Fede chuckles] [María] Ahh! [keypad clicking] I CAN'T GO HOME CAUSE I'D NEED TWO PUMPS, AND A TRIPLE NURSE'S SHIFT. AND TO SELL A KIDNEY, SOMETHING SHOULD REMAIN HEALTHY. [María sighs] Fede? I want you to bring me a notebook. You can ask Lourdes. She makes them by hand. There's one with a wolf on the cover. It's so cute. I want to write some things to Tomy. [Fede] Okay. We said we'd meet at 10:00. What time is it? 10:20. We're gonna miss visiting hours, you know. It's until noon, Maru. Ugh. - [Maru] Hi, how are you? - Good morning. - What time do the visits end? - The morning visit ends at noon. Okay. [upbeat guitar music playing] - [receptionist] Hello, good morning. - So, when does it end? Here they are. Those sneaky bitches. - They met up beforehand without us. - It's okay. [Maru] Why didn't you tell me you were meeting early? - [woman] Here we go. - Relax. We wanted to bring her a present. Present? What? No one told us. We didn't bring anything. We can share it. It can be from all of us. - A present from all of us. - It's fine. - No, it's not fine. Go buy her something. - Where will I get something, Maru? I don't know, and I don't care, just try. [woman] Well, there's a mall about two blocks away. - Are you serious? - [man] Great. - Give me the car keys, I'll go. - No, no, no. I'm going, I'm going. [Maru] Honey, I'll go with you. - [woman] Wait. What room is she in? - Second floor, 216. 216. Why does she get like this? Okay, let's... hey, wait, we're not all going upstairs together, are we? [overlapping chatter] [woman] Okay, to the right. - Fede. - [Fede] Oh, hey. What's up? Hi. How are you? - [woman] Fede. - [man] We made it. - You good? - [woman] Yeah, fine. - Good? - [woman] Good. Uh, you're gonna have to wait a bit. She's, uh, she's with the doctor. - [woman] Okay. - [man] The rest are coming up, anyway. You all came together? [friends] Yeah. Do you think they'll let us in all together? [Fede] No idea. Let's try it. - Wanna sit? - No. [woman] How is she? Good. Resting. - [woman] Is she in pain? - She says a bit. But that she can take it. You know what she's like. - Oh, I got her an amazing room. - Mmm. Really great. Five stars. - Oh. - [woman] That's great. [door opens] [Dr. Vigna] Okay, good. And how are you feeling? - Bad. - Mmm. I'm in the hospital, 20 doctors saw me, and no one can do anything. I'm sick of being stuck in bed. I understand. Any pain? [stammers] No, I'm fine. I can manage it. - Use the toilet? - Nope. Right. We'll be monitoring that. Okay, I'm gonna raise your backrest a little so we're at the same height. [bed motor whirring] That's good. You good? - Very good. - [chuckles] Me, too. [Dr. Vigna chuckles] One question. When it's too much, you're gonna put me to sleep, hmm? We're gonna talk about it at some point, I promise. But it's too early in the process. How much longer will it take? - Um... meaning? - For the end to come. No, well, I don't know that. I mean, no one leaves before their time. I won't do anything to speed it up, don't worry. [María breathes deeply] - You comfortable here? - Yes. It's important to me that you are. [María sighs] What do you think, why... why did this happen to me? No, not to you. This doesn't happen to you. It's not a virus, not a bacteria that invaded and attacked you. Then, it would be contagious. This cancer is... 100% yours. Perhaps we could call it "María." But let's not, please. - No. [chuckles] - No. It's genetic. You see, there are cancers... that relate to our routines, to our habits. See, if you smoked three packs of cigarettes a day, it's likely that you'd get lung cancer. But, um, in general, it's based on your genetic makeup. [María] Mmm. [upbeat guitar music playing] - [Dr. Vigna] Hey. - Can they come in? [Dr. Vigna] What is this, a rally? They're all her friends. Get on in there. - Go on. Come on. - Hey. - [woman] Hi, doctor. We'll be quiet. - Hi. [overlapping chatter] How was it? Oh, she got it all. She knew right away. She's really quick. Sure, I'm starting to see what your relationship is like. It's a symbiosis that's, uh, healthy and pathological. [chuckles] Uh, but don't worry, it's the same one I have with my wife. - [overlapping chatter] - [Fede] Okay, Tomy, look, here's your mom. She's staying in a room that's beautiful and incredible, mega-ultra VIP that your dad managed to score because he's a damn genius. Look at this. We've got these designer armchairs, just spectacular. And this is the floor. And next up, my son, I'm gonna show you the bathroom, right? Look at this, marble. Marble. Spectacular. - [overlapping chatter continues] - And here is your mom, who is, as usual, paying a little bit of attention to me, but is mostly joking around, chatting, or on her phone. You know how much she uses it. She's on it all the time. And here we all are with all our friends around us. Let me introduce them to you, Tomy. - This is Shoy... - Hello. ...an eminent Lacanian psychologist. No. No, no, cut it out. - [Fede] What did I say? - I'm not a psychologist. - [Fede] What are you? - An analyst. - [Fede] Same thing. - [friends clamoring] An analyst, an analyst, terribly sorry. [Shoy] Yeah, whatever. - [Fede] And this is Paula. - Hello, Tomy. - [Fede] She's a writer. - Yes. [Fede] You're gonna read her book because your mom's name is in it. And here's Charlie. Hello, Charlie. The ladies say that - more than a friend... - [María] He's like a brother. - He's a brother, right. - [all laughing] I knew you were gonna say that. [Fede] And this is Brenda. Now, Brenda is a painter, or more like a "hater," because she hates everything. - Kidding, kidding. - [all laughing] [Fede] Truth is, she's a designer, an illustrator, a genius. This, ladies and gentlemen, is Vera. Look at her, look. She's the CEO of an insurance company. [Charlie] More successful than all of us put together, - and that is a fact. - [all laughing] [Fede] And this is Leti. - She works for the government. - [Leti] Mmm-hmm. [Fede] If you get into any trouble, son, talk to Leti and she'll fix it. Right? Okay. And this is Agus. She teaches journalism, and she's a tango dancer, everybody. [all exclaiming] [Fede] What technique. Impressive! Bravo! - And this is Roxi. - Hi. - [Fede] A housewife, everybody. - [all laughing] But not exclusively. - [Fede] What's up? - Tell him I'm also a social worker. - [Fede] You didn't get your degree. - I will soon. - [Fede] Did you even finish the course? - [all laughing] [Fede] No, no, no! I'm gonna get it now. Okay, and this is Maru. Don't ever meet her, though, because you'll have to spend time with her every day, every day of your life, just like Hernández, there behind her. Poor guy. Huh? Hernán, who buys and sells apartments. What do you call that again? Broker. - Broker, right. - [Hernán] A real estate broker. - [friend] Ooh, broker. - Exactly. - [Maru laughing] - [Fede] Well, and here we are. We're deciding whether she stays here or we go home, or, you know what, maybe we'll get to go on a romantic honeymoon? - [friend] Aww. - And check out the view we have, son. - Pretty nice, huh? - [friend] Spectacular. - [Fede] Magnificent. - [Hernán] The view is shit! - [laughter] - [Fede] I never want to leave. So, anyway, here we are. Among friends, can't stop laughing our asses off, So you see your mom... hmm? This is the kind of person she is. Yeah? This person. That's why I love her as much as I do. [kisses] Bye, baby. [María] It's amazing how often people tell me that I'm brave and strong. [cheerful music playing] But that's all I know how to be. What else should I do? Sink into a big pit of self-pity? Better keep doing the cancer show on Twitter. [chuckles] The truth is, I feel bad all the time. It's like everything is backwards. Another eye. There. I like making eyes better. The pizzas are going to be good, but I think we'll have to make them a little bit later. EVERYTHING IS SHIT AND I'M GOING TO DIE. MAYBE IT HAPPENS TOMORROW, WHO KNOWS. THAT'D BE A SHAME. I STILL HAVE SOME GOOD JOKES. [music stops] [sighs heavily] [grunts softly] This one... this one is happy, and... and this one is mad. - This one is very happy. - And this? - And this one is sad. - [Fede and María] Why? Because... because these are the happy ones. - [Fede] Which is angry? - [Tomy] Red. - [Fede] And the color for sad? - [Tomy] This. - Ah... three happy and one sad? - [Tomy] Mmm. Good. [María] Is this one happy? - No. - Is it sad, too? Three happy, one sad. [Tomy] No, no. This... this one is angry. And this one is happy, happy. Why is this one angry? Why is it angry? Because... because it wants the happy color. The angry one does. This is the angry color. - I see. - [Fede] Ahh. And this color, this is the color blue. That... that means that is sadness. - [María] Mmm. - [Fede] Ah, it's true. [soft piano music playing] [María] What an unlucky break to get sick like this. I miss going out for walks with you and spending half an hour on each thing. Sometimes we go out wandering to buy food, to look at statues, we eat ice cream, and you get mad, and you don't want to walk, or you want to get out of the stroller in the middle of an avenue. I miss this more than anything. I hope I can do it again, but if I can't, I want you to know that those have been the happiest moments of my life and I love you. - Hello, María. Can we come in? - [María] Hi. This is Marina, a new resident. She started with us this week. She'll be at the hospital for a few months. - Hello, Marina. - [Marina] Hello, how are you? - Fine. - [Marina] How was last night? So-so. A little bit of pain. - Any nausea? - That, too. All right. Relax, and we'll take care of that. Okay, okay. - When did you get your degree? - In December, pretty recently. - [María] Cool. What specialty? - Yeah, uh... [doctor] Hello, hello. - [María] Hello. - Hello, doctor. - How are we feeling? - [María] Uh, so-so. - Mmm-hmm. - [Marina] She's been feeling some pain. All right. Let me see. - There? - Yeah. - Like a pull, right? - Yeah, a little pull. Yeah. If it gets more intense, we'll have to proceed with administering the morphine. Yeah? I thought we could wait a little bit longer. What for? No, it will relieve the pain. I can handle it. It's not that bad yet. I mean... You'll feel much better. Don't deprive yourself. Mmm-hmm. [Maru] Fede, we'll have to organize things a little, right? We don't know how long she'll be here. Until her body can take it, I guess. You know Marie. One day, she'll say, "Okay, I've got this," and she'll organize everything, every detail. Yes, but this isn't about Marie. It's about you and Tomy. I've already arranged Tomy's kindergarten with my mom and Marie's father. [Maru] It's not just the kindergarten. You have to eat. You can't just eat sandwiches. And if you're here for a month, for two months, what are you gonna do? Yeah, you can't eat at our place because we live so far away. Okay, perfect. Thanks. I'll figure something else out. Yeah, well, I mean, your clothes, you gotta do some laundry... Get off my back, Maru. This is hard for me. - But you haven't showered in two weeks. - Is that necessary? - It's foul. - [Hernán] Hey, hey, Maru has a point. We have to get organized, yeah? [Maru] Visits, for example. It can't just be you all day, okay? I know. I'm gonna make up a group chat without Marie, - with the 12 girls and Charlie... - [cell phone buzzing] ...and then organize a schedule with them to have visits all week. Hello? Who is this? Hi, how are you? Yeah, yeah, yeah, she got it. She loved it. Thank you so much. Bye. That was Lourdes. - Oh, her friend from that other group, no? - Mmm-hmm. The group from the arts and crafts classes? Yeah, all that shit. I mean, not shit. But... but she's really nice. [groans] Every day it feels like I get a new ache, and today it's in my back. Yes, well, you're in bed a lot. We'll see if we can get you an air mattress. - It didn't hurt yesterday. [grunts] - Easy. No, but your body is more fragile now. More sensitive. - Here, hold on to this. - Mmm-hmm. [machine beeping faintly] Is it nice outside today? [nurse] Yes, it's sunny. Let's see. - [nurse gasps] Can you manage? - I'm fine, yeah. You're okay? [María] They've got a huge crane over there. Do you know what they're putting up? [nurse] A new mall, I think. - [upbeat guitar music] - [María] It's hard to hear the world keeps changing without you, but you have to accept it. Or not, whatever. We're so irrelevant to the universe. It doesn't give a damn if we accept it or not. If you want to speed up, slow down, or even try to pause a level-100 metastatic carcinoma to, I don't know, see your kid finish primary school, the world goes on. And on top of all that, it goes faster and faster. [door opens] [nurse] What is it, María? What do you need? [María groans] I need to get to the toilet now. I'm gonna throw up. - [nurse yelps] What the... - [Fede exclaims] - [nurse clicks tongue] - [María moans] - [María moans] - Come on, let's go. - [María wincing] - Come on. I told you it wasn't a good idea to sleep here, didn't I? [nurse] If the vomiting continues, we'll have to intubate you. [María] Okay. [María vomiting and coughing] [Fede sighs] - [nurse] Better? - [María] Yeah. [toilet flushes] [shuffling footsteps] [María moaning] - Feeling better? - Yeah. - [nurse] Almost there. - [María sighs] If you need anything else, give me a call. - [María] I will. - [nurse] Mmm. Don't worry, I didn't see anything. Go back to sleep. Thanks. [door opens and closes] [Fede sighs heavily] [Fede] Why didn't you tell me you were feeling sick? Hmm? I didn't want to bother you. You need to sleep. [kiss] And I should be able to get to the damn bathroom by myself. I should. [upbeat guitar music playing] I PUKED MORE THAN I ATE. I CONFIRM THAT IT IS IMPOSSIBLE TO THROW UP WITHOUT CRYING. I NEVER CRY IN FRONT OF MY BABY, BUT I'M ONLY HUMAN, I CAN'T DO IT ALL ALL THE TIME. LUCKILY MY BODY MADE UP ITS MIND TO SLEEP FOR 14 HOURS CAUSE I'M GETTING ALL AGITATED BY SITTING ON THE BED AND I CAN'T DO SHIT ABOUT IT. I HAD MY STOMACH PUMPED LAST NIGHT. I RECOMMEND IT. NOW I'M GREAT. IT'S SO NICE WHAT YOU'RE TELLING ME! HOPEFULLY IT'LL BRING MY ASS BACK, THAT'S ALL THAT MATTERS. GOOD NIGHT, SOME PEOPLE HAVE A CRUCIFIX HANGING ABOVE THEIR BED, I HAVE AN IV. TOMORROW I'LL BE ANSWERING MORE MESSAGES AND SO ON. NOW I HAVE A BOOK TO FINISH. JUST IN CASE... [María] I'm madly in love with your strong legs, your Mick Jagger hair, your mouth that looks like mine. You look like me when I was a child. But you seem happier. Or is that just how I want to see you? I wish we could escape to somewhere far away, and you could run free in a field, hear the shouting. SILLY THOUGHTS THAT I HAVE I feel jealous and envious of the people who are going to see you grow up. Congratulations on the article about your wife. - Article? - In the Clarín. Didn't you see it? - No idea. - I'll bring you a copy. Here it is. WOMAN MOVES PEOPLE ON TWITTER TELLING HER FIGHT AGAINST CANCER - [Fede] When was it published? - [waiter] Today. Hold on to it. - [Fede] I'll bring it back soon. - [waiter] No problem. Marie? - [María] Yeah? - Look what's in the Clarín. What's this? Do you know the woman who wrote it? - No. Have you read it? - [cell phone ringing] Yeah. It's a great article. - Seriously? - Yeah, seriously. - Maru, how are you? - [whispers] Tell her no, no. No, no. I have no idea, I don't know. [whispers] I'll talk to her. She says the article is on the front page online. The whole article. Okay, I'll put her on. Hi, how are you? No, I had no idea. Well, you could maybe ask the girls. You see? Finally, I'm famous. Just a little bit late. [chuckles dryly] Okay. I'll see you later on this afternoon. Kisses. Does this mean that we're gonna get bombarded with interview requests now? What's this all about? - [María] You read the whole thing? - Some kind of celebrity? - How are you? - I just can't believe it! [kisses] [María] You see? It's so unfair you got famous because of cancer and not because of your ass. - [all laughing] - [Maru] I can't believe it. Such a great ass! It hurts to laugh. - Oh, you got up by yourself. - [Maru scoffs] I'm up. Do me a favor and help put the backrest up, Hernán? [Hernán] Did you receive more media requests? Yeah, but it's ridiculous. I'm not gonna talk about it now. - Why? Which one called you? - It was a morning show. Um... - Channel 11. - What? - With Vero Lozano? - Got it. Yeah. With Vero Lozano. You're doing it. - No, I'm not doing it. Why would I? - There. - Why would I... - Everybody watches that show. Why would I care about that? It doesn't do anything for me. I... No, you're right. Doesn't matter. Never mind. [María] You bring anything to eat? No, after what happened last time, we're not gonna bring you food anymore. - [María] Seriously? What? - We did bring you something. Ah... right. Uh... a speaker. - Hey, thanks, guys. I appreciate it. - [Hernán] For you to listen to music. No, this is yours. I can't take this from you. [Hernán] Doesn't matter. It's yours now. Thanks. - Hi, how are ya? - [receptionist] Good morning. I'm looking for Dr. Vigna. I'll call him. [on PA] Dr. Vigna, Dr. Vigna, contact the Information desk, thank you. Thank you. Oh, there were some things left at the main desk for your wife. What do you mean? What things? - Uh, like, gifts. - [phone ringing] - Ah, I'll come by later and pick them up. - Sure. Hello? Yes, doctor. The husband of the patient in room 216 is here. Good, perfect. He says to head upstairs. He's in his office. - Perfect. I'll come back for the gifts. - Okay. I'll let him know. - [classical music playing on radio] - Hello. - Oh, Federico, please. - Thank you. - Great article in the paper. - Yeah, isn't it? Thanks for mentioning the hospital. No, we didn't... no, we actually don't even know who wrote the article. Please, have a seat. Doctor, Channel 11 asked María to do an interview. - A live one? With cameras? - Uh-huh. Yes. We can't have any cameras at the hospital. You know I do everything I can. There's rules about entry. No plants, no groups, no kids allowed. And I feel I let you break all those rules. But cameras, no. - I mean, I still report to the director. - Yeah, well, maybe... Why doesn't she do the interview on the phone? Yeah, we could. Sure. That would be better. I don't know if she wants to be on a camera. She doesn't care about that. Yes, well, what she says is what really matters anyway. How much longer before they call? [Fede] Three minutes. - Does it still hurt? - [María] A bit. - Okay, I'll call for morphine. - No, no, wait. - You can't be in pain for this. - [María] It's okay, I can do it. I... I don't want to take any morphine, I'll be drooling and totally out of it. No way. I don't want any. [Fede] Look, this is it. The show's starting. [theme music playing on TV] [Vero] Social media can be an incredible resource, not only to vent and share your thoughts, but also to organize... - Is it on? - Just started. [Vero] ...in 140 characters, but it can also be used to talk about illness, to find others who may be suffering just like you. We've been following the story of María Vázquez, which is incredible. Suffering from ovarian cancer, she's currently in treatment, in the final stages of chemotherapy, battling cancer and sharing her story. María, through her tweets, has been an inspiration. [Leo] Here's some tweets María wrote when she first started receiving treatment. "Rescue doses of morphine. 'Don't deprive yourself, ' the doctor told me." "I'd rather not show them any of my sh... and keep on living, but thanks for all your love and support." We have her on the line now. María Vázquez, how are you? So happy to have you here today. How are you? - Hi, Leo. Hi, Vero. - [feedback on speaker] How are you both? Thanks so much for having me on. - What are you doing? I can't hear. - There's feedback. What can I do? [María] Well, about seven months ago, I had a pretty radical operation, a full hysterectomy, and I had everything removed. They pretty much hollowed me out. Cut here, slice there, take this out, then that... Pretty soon, there's nothing left at all. And after that, they started me on some chemotherapy, which worked and worked until it didn't work anymore. And, uh... well... you know, there's nothing more that we can do. We're all just waiting for the time to come. [Leo] So, waiting for the time to come... Well, what you're saying is really tough to say... The moment that I'm going to die, you know? We have to be honest. Yes, the moment that I'm going to die. [Leo] The moment you'll die. There's nothing else they can do? Nothing else they can try? [María] My health is very fragile right now. They... they can't operate on me, and they can't give me any more chemo because I'm too weak. But, honestly, even with all that, I'm in a place where they take really good care of me. It's lovely. They treat me very well. [Leo] And, María, looking back through your tweets, it seems like you've gone through every emotion. I mean, there's humor, there's anger, there's irony, too. - [María] Yeah. - And so what's your mood like today? [María] Oh well, today is kind of funny. When people come to visit, I end up doing a sort of a cancer stand-up special. And so, I mean, unless you come in and you find me puking in a bucket or something... I'm actually surrounded by laughter all the time. - [Vero] Y our son's three years old, María. - [María] Yes. And, I mean, do you think about him every minute of the day? [María] Pretty much, yeah. I talk to him a lot, too. We... we record videos, uh... I explain to him what's happening. What have you told him? [María] We've told him that... in a while, Mama won't be here, but that I'll always, um, be in his heart. I think he understands. And your husband? You're married, María? - What we're seeing now... - This is a photo of you two? [María] These photos were taken on our wedding day. We got married pretty quickly because we were living in sin and I was seven months pregnant. [chuckles] Yeah, that's me and Fede. My husband, he... he's always by my side. He takes care of me, comes to visit me every single day. And so when they told you, or when you found out about the diagnosis, did you have a positive outlook? Did you feel like you could overcome this? Well, I wasn't really told so much as I guessed. [Vero] What do you mean? Well, I went in to have an ultrasound done because I... well, my stomach looked like I had been pregnant for six months. And the doctor... [scoffs]...the doctors, they talk to each other like, uh... like we don't understand them. Like we don't know anything. [Vero] They sometimes underestimate their patients. [María] Yes, exactly, they can definitely underestimate us. Um, the doctor, he asked the technician, uh, "Hey, on a scale of..." Let's say, I don't know... "Between one and 45, where would you put this?" And so the technician said, "This? This is one hundred." [chuckles] [Leo] And, María, how old are you? Right now, I'm 42. In two days, I'll be 43. - [Leo] You're going to be 43 in two days. - Exactly right. If I make it... [chuckles] ...I'll be 43. You use this, I don't know, humor, this irony, and it's just to protect yourself, or to cope, I guess, but you seem to have it all the time. [María] No, no, it's not to protect myself. It's not my way of coping. This is the way... This is who I am. Sometimes I joke around with my friends and we laugh our asses of because they're more upset than I am. I think the right word might be "acceptance." - I accept. And, uh... - [upbeat guitar music playing] ...and your death is part of your life. I'M STILL HERE, I'M DONE TALKING, THAT'S ALL. FAME WILL BREAK YOU DOWN. I APPRECIATE THE SUGGESTION OF ALTERNATIVE THERAPIES AND SO ON. BUT SOMETIMES THE DIE IS CAST. I WON'T GOOGLE ANYTHING. HEALTH IS A BITCH, BUT AT LEAST IT GAVE ME 7 MONTHS OF BEAUTIFUL MOMENTS. Three, four, five, six, seven. Seven. [María] That much? It's a lot. One, two, three, seven, eleven. Fourteen, seventeen, eleven... - [laughing] - [Tomy]...four, five, six. [María] You're so funny, Tomy. You say such amusing things. But I don't remember them because I'm taking a pill called Idiotan. [Maru] Come on, just one. They're in season. No way, Maru. My body can't handle it. Mmm, okay. Just one. - Okay, one. - Yeah. - Oh, what is this? - They changed my mattress. - Why? - Too much sex on it. [laughs] Clearly. See, the girls and I wanted to tell you to take it easy, okay? Talking about you all over this hospital. This room is a real party, huh? [laughs and sighs] Hey, Maru... Hey... [chuckles weakly] Can you make sure that Fede ends up with someone? He's got a lot of... he has a lot of love to give. Marie, it took him 18 years to marry you. Just a date would be a miracle. No, I'm serious. Please. [sighs] He shouldn't be alone in his sadness. He should love, he should live, be happy. [María] Despite having my eyelashes fall out, which is horrible... - Excuse me. - Yes? There are more gifts here for your wife. - [Fede] Even more? - After the interview, yes. [María]...despite having lost my ass, losing 12 kilos, and having less muscle tone than a slug, I still feel pretty. Even bald and skeletal. We didn't want to lose them, so we kept them here. - Thank you. - There's another box. - Another one? I'll get it later, okay? - Yep, sure. [María] They may seem like silly things, brushing your teeth, putting on lotion, but they help keep you feeling like yourself. [nostalgic guitar music playing] Cancer doesn't take away your vanity. Tell me what you think. [chuckles] You look great today. Yes, of course. They've already given me three shots of morphine. I'm pretty much floating. Oh, this is what we were missing. I've seen this cat everywhere. Ahh, it's a maneki-neko. It's, uh... [chuckles] It's for luck. What else is there for me? [Fede] Lotions, lotions, more lotions. - Hello. - [María] Hello. - Got some more gifts for you. - [Fede] Hi. - [María] Ahh. - And a few sweets left in the fridge. [chuckles] So many gifts, María, huh? [María] Take it back. There's no way I can eat all of this. Fede, maybe if there's anything that you think looks good, you can have it. - Veal and tuna. - [all chuckle] Got some mozzarella. - [María] No. - That's good. - Carrot pudding. - [María] Oh, no, no. - What's this? - [María] What's that? [Fede] Strawberry custard cake. Hmm? - Maybe we could give this to Tomy. - I think you want it. [chuckles] No, take everything back, but leave that for the gentleman to eat. [all chuckle] [nurse] Thank you very much. We'll share them with all the other nurses. - Yeah. - [nurse] See you soon. - [Fede] Thank you. See you. - [nurse] You're welcome. - Hey, Marie. - [María] Yeah? They want to do three more interviews. No. No, I can't. No, see... see if there's any way to get out of them, but, uh... No, it's enough. Okay. You know, great timing on getting famous, huh? - [both chuckle dryly] - [Fede] It's like a joke. I'm going to talk to Néstor from city council, remember him? Maybe he can get me a disability permit so I don't have to drive around all the time just looking for places to park. [both] Bye. - You gonna go in there limping? - Yes. Like this. [María chuckles] - When are you going to bring Tomy? - Maru's bringing him today. [door opens] [door closes] [gentle piano music playing] [María] We met in December, 1991, and we never broke up, even though we had many problems and fights. [guests cheering] [María] I couldn't wish anything better for you, my child, than to find a love like this in your life. [Fede] Ah! - [man] Come on. Go, go, go! - [indistinct chatter] [María] A love that is special, passionate, stormy... - [María] And she scores! Goal! - [man] Come on! [María] ...unique, loving... "A loving love." Mom, you're so silly. And how was last night? It was all right. A bit of vomiting. - Did you eat? - Strawberries. - Hmm. - I shouldn't have. - [chuckling] Yes. - [María chuckles] It's all right. Although because you're still vomiting, it's possible for you to breathe it in, and it might end up in your lungs. So we're going to ask the nurse to put in a nasogastric tube. Okay. It may bother you a little at first, but you'll get used to it. So you were telling me about the trip you took to Europe with your family. Ah... hmm. You think it might be time for the sedation? It might be. I think you'll know when the time is right. I'm still finishing up the notebook for Tomy, but there's not much left to do. Nine, ten pages. Next week, then, maybe. All right. You tell me when, and we can set a date. What's it like? Like nothing. You won't even know it. We increase your dose of morphine, add some Midazolam, and then you just simply go to sleep. And so I don't wake up? We'll be monitoring you and administering the proper doses so that you won't wake up. [María sighs] Have you given any thought to saying your goodbyes? No, I haven't yet. [folk music playing] NOTHING ELSE CAN BE DONE, FOLKS. ALL THE WAY TO THE END WITH A SMILE AND A CLENCHED FIST. BUT THIS IS THE END. IT'S MY BIRTHDAY TOMORROW. I DON'T WANT GIFTS OR COMPLIMENTS. I JUST WANT A MEXICAN PARTY WITH THOSE DAY OF THE DEAD THINGS. [folk music continues on speaker] These candles are gonna look great at night. Yeah. Should we take some photos and then share them? Hmm? Is that too much? No... [indistinct chatter] You can come in. - I need to talk to you. - What's up? How is she? Aw, Charlie... Because... what did the doctors say? They didn't say anything. Because you know what doctors are like. They talk amongst themselves, no? - [sighs] Did you bring a gift? - Yeah, uh... She told us she didn't want any. It's just the two Puck books that she needs for her collection, that's all. Okay, come in. [folk music continues on speaker] She's sleeping. Shh. [Maru] With everything they give her... Hey, Charlie. We're gonna let her rest now for a little bit. - Yeah, I'll just be a minute. - Later. See you. - [Fede] I thought you were sleeping. - [María] No. What is that? What you got? Hamburger. I can eat it outside so it doesn't tempt you. It won't tempt me. I'm not hungry. [Fede] Hi. Eat it here. - I brought a few things you wanted. - Oh, great. I was reading the book that Charlie gave me for my birthday. One of the two Puck books that I needed. I can't believe he remembered. He's a genius. PUCK TRIUMPHS - Did you stop off at home? - Yeah, Rosa was there cleaning. Mmm. Did you pay her? No, she told me to pay her next week. - Ah. - She sends you a big kiss. What else? Oh, I paid our phone bills, - and they were overdue, so that too. - [gentle piano music playing] And, uh, the window still leaks in Tomy's room. As soon as I have time, I'll seal it again. Okay. The plants look perfect. They send kisses, too. [María chuckles weakly] - Send me a picture. [coughs] - I will. I gave the kindergarten principal a gift because of how nice she was with Tomy. Fede, should we set a date? - You talked with Vigna? - Yes. He told me I could set the day. Okay. It could be Friday. What do you think? Yeah. We're gonna have to talk to Tomy. Tomorrow, soon. Uh-huh. [María] Every contract has a catch. When we got married, Fede had agreed to be with me until death did us part. [Dr. Vigna] Federico! [María] But he didn't read the fine print. How are you? I need you to get a notary who can certify that María consents to her terminal sedation. - Is there a problem? - No, no. - We should have it just in case. - Where can I find a notary? Ask at Administration downstairs. They should know some in the area. - They don't come here? - Not to worry, this is a regular service. - Okay, I guess I'll go right now. - Let me know. I'll be here until late. [María] He probably never imagined that the moment would come so soon. - But this is it for me. - Excuse me. - Where can I find the notary? - Third floor. Thank you. [María] I'd much rather he took me to Paris, but right now this is the best present he can give me, arranging my death. Hello. - [woman] Good afternoon. - I'd like to speak to Señor Ceruolo. The father or son? Oh, it doesn't matter. It's for a certification. Okay, take a seat. It shouldn't be long. - Okay, thanks. - You're welcome. [María] In my entire life, I don't think I've ever seen such an act of love. You can come in, sir. Thank you. Excuse me. - Good afternoon. - [Fede] Afternoon. - How are you? Take a seat, please. - Fine. - Thank you. - How can I help you today? My wife is in the hospital a few blocks from here, and we need an authorization notarized. Do you have it? I... I didn't bring anything. Hmm. It's a deed, and for that, I need to have a hard copy. What? They didn't tell me any of this. All right, let's see, go back to the hospital and ask them to give you a copy of the form. - Do you understand? - Okay, I'll go and I'll come right back. No, no, no, not now. It's too late today. - Come back tomorrow, all right? - Can't I come back after hours? This certification, is it urgent? My wife is dying, and she needs to sign the authorization for terminal sedation. Oh, well, I see. Well, we'll do this then. Here's my card. Do what you have to, I'll stay at the office awhile. If you're delayed coming back, just give me a call and let me know. - Thank you, sir. Thank you. - No, please. Of course. - My clothes go to you. - [keypad clicking] Take whichever ones you want. They're all yours. The wedding dress is my mother's, same as the purses and the antique jewelry. They're all yours. Donate the rest or give it away. Throw it away. Whatever you want. Give the embroidery to Vera. She'll know, she'll know. Makeup, you can decide. Give the Puck series to Agus, Paula's daughter. [Maru] Mmm-hmm. Oh, I know. Throw things away. Don't be afraid to do it. Fede... Fede won't be able to. You... you help him throw things out. Okay, listen to me. This is important. there's a Los Panchos Trío CD, Love Story. It's our song. It's the one that he made me listen to on the very first day we met. You have to make it disappear. Make sure Fede doesn't find it, or he won't be able to stop listening, and it'll make him feel awful. Okay. Uh, wasn't your song "Contigo Aprendí"? - No. - By Manzanero? No. Don't throw the wrong thing away. No. No, no, no. Okay. I got it, okay. For Dr. Molina, something nice. - Sure. - Vede, Molina... All of the nurses, something for them also. - Okay. - [sighing heavily] - Charlie... Charlie gets the dryer. - [Maru chuckles] He'll be happy. - [Maru] Yeah, it's the best present. - [chuckles weakly] [exhales slowly] [María singing in Spanish] ♪ You're no longer by my side, love ♪ [voice breaking] ♪ I only have loneliness in my soul ♪ [in English] Stop. Don't make it harder for yourself. Yeah, I'm done. I'm done. Okay? [PA chiming] [on PA] Dr. Vigna, Dr. Vigna, please come to Reception. - He'll be here. - Thanks. [Fede exhales slowly] - [Fede] Doctor. Doctor. - [Dr. Vigna] Hey, how are you? I need the form María has to sign. No, forget about that. Uh, we need to go see the director. - What's wrong? - Nothing that can't be solved. What? Another problem? Don't worry, just leave it to me. I'll handle it. [elevator dings] Everything he says, you agree. Well, Federico, you know everyone cares about María very much, and we care about you, too. We all agree that the strength you're showing in this situation is admirable. It is. That's why we try to help as much as possible. - You agree, doctor? - Indeed, yes. We appreciate it very much. Truly. But, uh, this is a delicate issue. The line between euthanasia and terminal sedation is muddy and can lead to multiple interpretations. In fact, those who do not agree with the idea of terminal sedation include many of our colleagues. Don't you think that's a question of, uh, semantics? I believe we should say "compassionate sedation," not "terminal." [director] Yes. The Dignified Death Act says the physician must be the one to propose the terminal sedation with the consent of the patient or the relatives in the event they're in no condition to decide, the day the pain becomes unbearable or the procedures to combat it don't work any longer. But we cannot say with certainty that this will be done in five days because that would imply that the patient can live with the pain, that it is not unbearable, and that less extreme methods continue to work. [Fede exhales] Look, Federico, this is a regular practice at the clinic, right, doctor? Yes, yes, it's very common. But in María's case, she's a public figure, appearing in Clarín, interviewed on TV... Not to mention her social media posts that have gone viral. The public might get confused. Someone on the outside might think that what we're doing here is... euthanasia. - [cell phone ringing] - My apologies. I have to take this. Federico... if she were my wife, I'd take her home and get someone to administer the terminal sedation. I'm not telling you this as the director of the hospital. Does this mean you're going to take her home now? [cough] The director said if she was his wife, he'd take her and sedate her at home. [Maru] Well... if you ask me, he just said that so he'd look good. [María] What did Vigna say? That... that it's out of his hands? [Maru] He's the head physician. He must be able to do something. [María] Let's leave it to Vigna. Let me call Adrián. Adrián? Adrián's a nutritionist, Fede. What can he say? What can he do? [Fede] A nutritionist, but also a doctor. [María] Come on, no. A nutritionist? [laughs] Why won't they do it at the hospital? Because of all that shit I already told you about. Marie shouldn't suffer like this. Of course not. So... you gonna take her home? That's the idea, yeah. Hmm. Come on, let's sit down. Where are you going with this piece of junk? Up north. To Jujuy this summer. - Bet you won't make it a mile. - Ah, you think? Come back in a few months and check it out then. [Fede] It's not gonna make it. Look, Fede, doing this sort of thing isn't easy. You know that? It's not just one injection. You have to stay with her, you have to monitor her. You have to administer the drugs. You need to keep her asleep and at the same time reduce her hydration. Understand? Uh-huh. The process takes five days, a week, even more. Isn't there... - I don't know, something faster? - Euthanasia would be fastest. I can try to get a doctor for you, if you like. No, no, no. No. When all this started, I promised Marie if something had to be done, I'd do it. - Tell me everything. - Okay. Okay. If you're gonna take her home, you have to get them to send her home with a central IV line. It's a catheter they insert into one of the big veins. Leads directly to the heart. - What if she already has one? - No, there's no way. But they'll realize. They're not stupid. You don't have anyone at the hospital you can trust? I don't know. I guess not. Maybe... So what do I do after she has the central line? Once she has that, you need to go to the pharmacy and pick up potassium chloride. - Potassium chloride. - Hi, Fede. - Hi, how's Marie? - [Fede] Hi, Estela. She's okay. I need to visit her. I hope I can make some time to see her this week. I'm off to your mother's. - I'll pick you up later. - Okay. - Give her a kiss for me. - Okay, I will. - What did you say I need? - Potassium chloride. - And I can get it that easy? - It's over-the-counter. They use it for diarrhea, vomiting. You won't have a problem. Then bring it out here. I'll prepare the syringe. All you'll have to do is inject it into the central line. Do you think you can do it? Yeah. Uh, what if they decided to do an autopsy? Would they find it? If they did an autopsy, yes, they would. But I don't see why they'd do an autopsy for a terminal cancer patient. And if they don't put in a central line? You would have to put the potassium chloride directly into the IV line. It's slower. Just see if you can get them to put in a central line. It's faster. It goes straight to the heart. Doctor? - Yes, how are you? - Do you have a second? Uh, take that down to the lab and I'll meet you there. Yes? - Okay, we've decided to go home. - You'll have to speak with Dr. Vigna. Yes, but we're going to need a central line. A central line? But why? I mean, well... for medications, I guess, in case she needs them. Who told you? It was her usual doctor who asked. You know, her GP. No, tell him to call us directly. For us to put in a central line, there has to be a good reason. - Ah. - Mmm-hmm. Have him call us. Okay. Thank you. [gentle music playing] What did Adrián say? - Remember what we said? - Yeah. If something had to be done, I'd do it. Yeah. A bit of potassium. It's instant. Adrián prepares it, and I put it in your IV. And if they find out? That's impossible, Marie. Adrián... he said... They don't do autopsies on people with cancer. Should we just go home, then? Yeah. Go home, do it there. If I die right after getting home, they'll suspect. They're not stupid. Tomy loses both of us because you end up in jail. We can't. What's wrong with you? Come on. Are you drunk? What do you mean you're gonna kill her? Yeah, I'm gonna kill her. I talked to her when all of this started. She'll be here, what, five months? A hundred more goodbyes? Who told you she'll be here for five months? I don't know. Five days? Ten days? She can't go on like this. They put her to sleep, she wakes up again. And someone has to give her the fucking potassium. You know I'm right. I'm not crazy. I can't watch her suffer. No, it's okay, Fede. I know you have to do it, but hearing it, it's messed up. Maybe you could ask the director? Or can Dr. Vigna take care of it? No, he won't do it. - But he said he would help out. - He just wanted to get rid of me. - Federico, there you are. - Oh, yes. - Hi, how are you? - I'll go see Marie. Yeah, okay. So Dr. Vigna said María needs to fill out this form to, uh, deny any and all procedures to prolong her life. Do you understand? - [Fede] Mmm-hmm. - Here. With all this signed, he'll be able to go ahead and perform the sedation on Friday. Finally. What a nightmare. So do we need the notary to come and sign? - No, no, her... the form is enough, just... - Okay. Just don't... don't post anything. Okay, thanks. Of course. - Really, thanks. - No problem. Marie, honey. You have to sign this, honey. - Where do I sign? - Here. Here. There you go. With this, they can do the sedation on Friday. There you go. Who's authorizing this? Vigna. Done? Okay. Before he takes it back. - Hey, calm down. - Yeah, I'll be right back. Will you organize the goodbyes? [Hernán] Roxi's here. - [woman] Hi. - Hello. [Fede] Hello. I'm the first one? - [woman] No, Leti already went. - Oh. - What did you say to her? - [woman] What do you want me to say? - You? - No, I'm going last. Honestly, I don't even know if I can do it. - We'll see. - Oh... I don't... I don't know... Ugh. Damn it. What? - [Maru] Take this. - Okay. Can I have another one? - Come on, two? You'll be drooling. - Just give here one more. If it makes her feel better, why stop at just one? - You could have another after. - Sure, just give me another one. - For later. - It's a lot. - Go on, go. - Okay, I'm going up. Good luck. [María] Hi, Roxi. [crying] Oh, Marie. [Roxi crying] I'm so stupid! They told me not to cry. I'm sorry. It's okay, Roxi. It's okay. [Roxi sniffling] I don't know... it's the first time I've said goodbye like this. Don't worry about it. - It's the first time I'm dying, too. - [both laughing] You never change, huh? Here. I also got a tattoo. [sniffles] So now I'll always remember you. When I... When I get changed, when I take a bath, when I fuck. [both laughing] [laughing weakly] Please... When you have time, do me a favor. Take Tomy out. Okay? Take him out for walks. - Of course. - Don't forget. [sniffles] Give your mom a kiss for me. [chuckling and sniffling] [Roxi crying] [Charlie] Can I come in? Hi, Charlie. [both kiss] [stammers] I don't know how to say goodbye. How do we do this? [María chuckles softly] - Pleasure to know you? - [both chuckle] How's that? - How's the construction going? - It's not. Oh... Seems I need more money. [chuckles] You've gotta work, Charlie. You've gotta work a lot. Seriously. Make a lot of money. A lot of it, okay? [chuckles] I want to thank you for... for all the years we've had together. You're the one person who can help me be myself. [chuckles weakly] You know, I'm an atheist, like you. But... if there is something else... give me a sign. Uh... write to me... [chuckles] maybe a mirror in the bathroom. Or the little notebook you gave me, write something in that. Okay? Write to me. Charlie, you can go if you need to. Go. No, it's fine. I don't have anything. They're here. Hi, Dad. - Hi, Mom, how are you? - Hello. Good. Hi, baby. Fede, do you want us to go with you? No, no. You can go later. - I'm bringing Tomy up to Marie. - [Fede's dad] Mmm. - Have a seat. - [Fede's mom] All right. It's a button that you push in case you need help. When you push it, there's a bell, and the bell makes someone come and help. [Tomy] Does it go crazy? [Fede] A little. - [Tomy] A little? But, but not a lot. - [Fede] Yeah. - Hello, hello, hello. Hi. - [Tomy] Does it go... Hello! - [Fede] Hello! - Oh, hi! Hello! - Come here. - [Fede] Okay, go. - Hi, hi, hi. - [Fede grunts] Up. Tomy... - [María kisses] Mmm, hello, my baby. - [Fede] I'll be outside, okay? - If you need me. - Okay. Mmm-hmm. [María kissing] - Hello. - [Tomy] What's that? Is that yours? Is that one yours? [Tomy continues indistinctly] [door closes] [Tomy and María speaking indistinctly] Which one is this? [María] That one? That's the fried egg face. Mmm, apple face, then? Hey, I did it! My turn. Concentrate. It's a really tricky one. It's a fruit. It's not an easy one. Okay. Uh... It's a... a banana. Banana. Your turn. That's it! [chuckles] Is it really juicy? Watermelon. - Really? - Yeah. You get a gold star. - One star because I won? - No star. You get nothing at all. Nothing for me? Are you serious? - Because... 'cause you lost. - And where do you go when you lose? Nowhere. You stay here... to play. [chuckles and sniffles] [María] I could never explain to you how much I love you. - The joy of seeing your expressions... - [gentle piano music playing] ...and the anger I feel for having left so soon. [María and Tomy continue indistinctly] But living includes dying, and often, in a way, that's unfair, unnecessary, so suddenly random? There are worse deaths, lives without passion or anything, without Fede, without Marie, without Tomy. This is a sad and sweet death. Think about that. You'll understand it, my little boy. My okapi. Sorry, excuse me. Uh, can you wait a bit? She's with our son. - [nurses] Sure. - [Fede] Mmm-hmm. - [nurse] We'll come back later. - Okay. Thank you. That's kind. Thanks. [sighs] HI EVERYONE, THIS IS FEDERICO, MARIE'S HUSBAND. I AM IN CHARGE OF HER ACCOUNT BECAUSE SHE IS NO LONGER ABLE TO TWEET. [upbeat guitar music playing] What time is it? [Maru] It's almost 5:00. Hey, 2,000 retweets. [knocking on door] - Oh, hi. - Hello, how are you? - Is it good? - It's fine. - Can I ask you a question? - Sure. - Is this dose immediate? - What dose? - This is the sedation. - No, this is the regular dosage. But she was supposed to be sedated today. She isn't supposed to be. She signed the form. - You should talk to Dr. Molina. - Where is she? I think she's on the second floor. Be right back. Why won't you do it? Doctor, listen. No, you listen to me. I'm not willing to cross certain limits. - What do you mean "certain limits"? - I mean the limits of my conscience. Okay, I'm gonna call Dr. Vigna, and he'll find a doctor who does what needs to be done. Well, it's not just his decision. Sorry. Doctor, I understand and respect your position. A hundred percent. But please try to see where I'm coming from. Marie can't keep living in these conditions. Everything she eats, she vomits. She's crying from the pain. If there was even a chance, a one-in-a-million chance, I'd agree with you. But you know there isn't. [sighs] Look, Fede, the point is I have a duty to those like María. I can kill pain, not a person. That's why I chose medicine. Excuse me. Federico. - How are you? - What's happening? Let me explain. It's the vultures. This isn't me or the director. The hospital's lawyer was quite blunt, "No sedation for María." We do it, and they'll ask for the medical records. They'll figure it out. - But it isn't illegal. - Yes, but they panicked. They're afraid of the media. They think some unscrupulous journalist will start asking questions and accuse the hospital of performing euthanasia. Just imagine, "The Hospital Murders a Patient." They can't risk that. - So what now? - Look, relax. The only difference is that what would've taken two days, is more likely to be seven or eight. So that nobody suspects. She won't suffer? No. Her pain receptors will be totally inhibited. - But she'll still be conscious? - No. She won't be conscious. She won't suffer. - [gentle piano music playing] - Mmm. Those are gorgeous. They're like Mom's? - No. - Are they like Papa's? No. Are they like yours? I ate a man. - Did you see? - Yes. - Because I was hungry. - Hmm. I ate another fish. Ooh, and now I'm eating a lady! I'm eating a pretty lady and a fish now. And another fish. I'm eating... [imitates chomping] I have to eat it. They're killing me! - They're all killing me! - Mmm. I died. No! It's not fair. - They killed you? - They killed me, yes. - Oh, no. - They killed me. - Mmm. - They're so mean to me. [clicks tongue] I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry, baby. [gentle piano music playing] [María] Nothing lasts forever, Tomy. Not ice cream, nor movies, nor the pretty things, nor the ugly things, nor the leaves on the trees, nor Mommy. But I will be in your heart, here, until you aren't here anymore, but live in other hearts as well. And so nothing ever dies. Something always lives on. LOVE. READ. LOOK. LISTEN. PLAY SOME MUSIC. DRAW. STUDY. WORK. TRAVEL. CONSUME WITH MODERATION. PURSUE. LEAVE. LISTEN TO YOUR DAD. COMPLAIN. OBEY. EAT. PUT ON A JACKET. WELL, DO WHATEVER YOU WANT. AND THINK ABOUT ME EVERY NOW AND THEN. María Vázquez received terminal sedation and died on April 21st, 2015. A few months later, the manuscript she wrote for her son was published and became a bestseller.
