Yes yes What are you trying to say? Don't open your mouth wide when you're taking afternoon nap Your mouth is bigger than when I was singing! Afly might just land in your throat You have nocturia, right? at least three times a night you went in and out of the washroom, it's even more often than when I was pregnant You've been eating five bananas, three papayas Drinking wintermelon barley tea and stayed in the toilet for half an hour That's abnormal! It's none of your business! You! Big mouth! Full of decay No wonder you have bad breath You! Too much coconut water during pregnancy Causing your baby to regurgitate milk. Am I right? And you! I don't care whether you're 'Miss Red' or 'Red Bean Soup'! Too much wind in your head that caused severe headache Come to my clinic, I'll treat you Okay Excuse me Oh my goodness, I'm gone! I'm talking like a busy body and grumpy old woman today! Sarah shared it! See for yourself Read it out loud Just read! This is my grandpa, he knows martial art His 'Wing Chun' is superb but, he salivates when he sleeps and he makes loud sound Snoring Right, he will snore and he even has constipation problem He stays long in the toilet Are all old people going through the same thing? Don't read it anymore! So wrong! Shi Jia! How could you expose my secrets? Now everyone pointed out on me whenever they saw me Moreover they used to respect me Greet me Master Lin every time they see me! Now, they just laugh behind my back! Making fun of me I am sharing the truth But it has nothing to do with others Grandpa, your thinking is too old fashion Like my friends in United States. . . Jeff, Emily, Justin, Carina. . . Their grandparents communicate through friendsbook and blog too So whether it's constipation, snoring or salivate during sleep, alzheimer. . . Excuse Me They share too It's common aging issue Grandpa, you are not alone And when they are sick, they go online to seek medical advice or research on relevant info They encourage one another, it's not shameful So, not a problem at all I hardly understood half of what you have said! Here is not United States! Grandpa, you should learn how to go online, so that you don't fall behind Go online? I've fed fish today! Online? Grandpa feels like hanging myself Don't say that! Touch wood! I've said so much, do you understand? Grandma, grandpa is afraid of doctor and medicine I told him to eat an apple a day but he refused to listen Please keep him in your prayers, let him recover from constipation So complicated! At first the salesman said 2G is good Then he told me 3G is stronger Later he claimed 4G is better than 2G and 3G I am so confused What is all the 'G' about? Bao! Are you here to help me to choose a phone, or here to eat? Let me think. . . You can buy I phone, Samsung, Oppo, Sony, Nokia, HTC or Little Mi Since you're a newbie, it doesn't matter You will change when there's a new model anyway But, I really, really want to have a new Ipad I meant the tablet With the tablet I can teach you how to use your phone The tablet you mentioned, is it the bigger ones? but how come only the big gadget can teach the small gadget? Of course only the big can teach the small! Just like only big bird can teach a small bird how to fly, right? You're so out! My granddaughter said I'm out, and now you said the same too I'll make sure I'm not out! Okay, good good! I'll work hard too! but. . . please please do not let my parents know about this Else they will hit me as if I'm a pancake that stick on the wall Ok deal! You don't tell Sarah that I'm learning how to use the Internet too Why? Just don't tell Else I wont buy it for you Okay, okay, I swear! What is this? Away of keeping promises. Hero taught me, you just follow Eat some french fries Mum, I'm back! You rascal! What! Why did you hit me? I'm going to give you a hard lesson today Enough! Bao, tell me Since when you learnt to steal from others? I did not?! Still deny? Where did you get this from? Answer me! Did you steal money from shop, or you stole it from elsewhere? You're looking at my things without my permission too I'm worried that you rub bad habits, that's why I'm checking your bag No explanation required Don't answer back! I'm going to beat you until you tell me the truth! Enough, do you want to beat him to death? Stay calm Bao, what happened? No matter what you want I make sure we buy it for you Mobile phone, gadgets, and all sort of toys Why are you still stealing? Mum, I did not steal from others You thought all I wanted are just gadgets and toys? I rather not have phone and gadgets All I want is just your companion, and spending more time with me Take me to the movies, theme parks You've been saying for over a thousand times to bring me to Singapore But it's all lies I bet you all don't know that I'm good in basketball You've never come to my school to see me compete against other team And. . . Can both of you not argue everyday? I'm scared everytime you two quarreled... very scared How could you do this? You'll be sued if you're in United States My mum has never invaded my privacy She wont hit me Adults should respect children too What are you talking about? We love him, we just care about him! Aunty Ming, this is a misunderstanding I bought the tablet for Bao I asked Bao to teach me how to use the Internet and agreed to buy him an Ipad. He did not steal! I'm responsible for this The commendable thing is Bao kept his promise even when he's being scolded and beaten He is noble hearted It's your blessing to have Bao as your son Bao. . . Bao, sorry son Do it yourself Bao Bao... Bao... Baby Come Grandpa Why didn't you ask me to teach you how to use the Internet? Master Lin, your granddaughter is beautiful Grandpa, why didn't you ask me to teach you? Grandpa We shall talk later Grandpa What is the model of your phone, grandpa? What is the number? You're so long winded! Grandpa, I'm your family, why did you ask an outsider to teach you You're good to Bao, why didn't you treat your family better? I'm talking to you! Look at me when I'm speaking, answer me! Speak Mandarin, okay! Grandpa! You're annoying me, stop jumping! Please grandpa! Tell me the brand? Please grandpa, what's the brand? Is it Iphone or Samsung?

I have nothing to do with all mentioned above! Keep the noise down I did not say anything Walk too loud Which one?

This is not the herb medicine, it's tea! Who? Who broke my herb medicine? Stand there Come over! Who did it?! We accidentally broke it, I'm sorry You broke my thing and sorry is the only thing you're saying? How many times I've told you not to touch my things? You never learn to be a good kid Just like your mum, ignore instructions It's only a bottle of herb medicine It's not just a herb medicine I had put too much of myself in it 12 years ago I know you don't like me, I don't like you too, get it? You! Master What do you want? You don't talk for her It's all my fault What are you talking about? Actually I broke the the bottle of medicine It's not Sarah's fault Scold and hit me if you want to Sarah has nothing to do with it We were just trying to hang the photo frame When I turned, I accidentally fling the bottle to the floor Did you see Sarah? No Thank you Have you seen Sarah? Shi Jia Shi Jia Don't scare grandpa! Shi Jia < Twinkle, twinkle, little star > < How I wonder what you are > < Up above the world so high > < Like a diamond in the sky > < Twinkle, twinkle, little star > < How I wonder what you are > You asked whether I've hit your mum before? If you want to go, then you don't step in to my house anymore! I've not thought of coming back but I regretted. . . You asked me, whether I've been to New York? Yes I've been to New York This is Chinese herb medicine For my daughter, for her confinement What is this? Some kind of chinese medicine or remedy?

During her secondary years, she met an useless man She was determined to follow him to United States What saddened me most was... Not long after they went to United States The useless man dumped you both Your mum had a hard time but she is capable An asian girl who has a baby and needs to handle studies in the same time won a place in a top fashion company in United States by her hard work She's our pride She brings glory to the Chinese! Yes, many celebrities wear mum's design That day, she called back suddenly and said she's coming back with you along I was shocked, but happy However. . . She came and went in a rush. . . Just stayed a short while I know she still hates me in her heart... Grandpa, I know everything about mum and I know who is my father Hello, I came from New York, have you been to United States? No Bye Bye Don't worry I'm not trying to tell my father anything I just want to see how he looks like now I have you and mum, you both love me very much It doesn't matter if I don't have a father Actually, I'm not a good father too and not a good grandfather When both of you needed me most, I was not there Grandpa and grandma are like stars, not always seen but forever there. . .
