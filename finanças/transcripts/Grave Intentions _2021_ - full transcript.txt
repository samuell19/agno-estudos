Intention. Intention is the heart of all magical workings. Intention is pure energy. The energy that fuels the magic. Energy is like electricity. 'Tis neither positive, nor negative, but it can be charged. Your intent charges the energy. Positive or negative. Good... Or evil. You must be mindful of your intention when working magic. Focus on your desire or goal, but be clear and specific. Because what you want may not be what you get. While intention is powerful, tools can help amplify it. Tools I'm happy to provide, for a price. Your immortal soul. I just messin' with ya. Actually, I offer a number of reasonably-priced Scroll through my enchanted selection till you find an item that'll bring about your happily-ever-after. Because everybody has a story. The question is, are you the hero, or the villain? Like this customer. She's looking to work some candle magic. Now, burning candles for spiritual purposes goes back to ancient times and the belief that a lit candle connects our physical world with the other side. Colors carry different energy frequencies, so the color of the candle should match your goal. Your intention. White is all about peace, purification and new beginnings. Red is a fiery color, used for love, passion and courage. Orange brings about profound change and matters involving justice and law. Yellow is for creativity, logic and other powers of the mind. Green is the color of prosperity, and is associated with money, luck, health and success. In business or gambling. Blue deals with harmony and emotional healing, and seeking truth in justice. Purple is for power, ambition and spiritual awakening. Now, some folks believe black candles are evil. Not so, but they are a powerful tool for protection and absorbing negative energies. This customer has a big game coming up and is looking for a little luck. Definitely a green candle for you, child. Now we inscribe the candle with the name of the target of the magic. The last step is fixing the candle with dressing oil. This makes the spell more powerful and seals the magic inside, until the candle is burned. I hope this brings the luck she needs. Okay, does anyone else not have a partner? Oh, Mattie. You're in luck. Everyone, I'd like to introduce you to our newest member. Olivia Korhonen, joining us from a European bridge group. Come say hello, partner. Oh. Well, it certainly is my pleasure. The worst betting I've ever seen. Let's treat each other like ladies, shall we? Thank you for... Sorry, I'm not very good, but usually I'm not that awful. I wouldn't blame you if you never wanted to play with me again. I enjoyed the game, even though we lost. We'll turn things around with time. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Isn't she lovely? Don? Grab me a beer, would you, sweetheart? You girls takin' this game so seriously. You don't hear Bud and me say we're gonna kill each other, do ya? And with him, I got plenty of reason. It wasn't like that. You didn't hear it! It was more than the game. I heard it. I'm on it, okay? All right, look, if she actually does it, I'll take a dim view. I'll take a very dim view. Don, I am not safe! Mattie, come on. This is all bullshit. Baby, you're safe. Everything's fine, okay? Yes! Come watch this with me. Come on, sweetheart. Good shot! Yeah, watch this put. A dog's predatory instincts can never be fully suppressed. Most attacks are on prey that's perceived as fearful, weak... Oh, my goodness. Look at her. It's Mattie. She's changed. She looks beautiful. Just really looks gorgeous. Beautiful. I'm going to kill you. I'm going to kill you. Hello, partner. So this is why your hair looks so good. I am looking forward to practice. I'm not sure, um... I have things to do. Maybe. Oh, no, you must come. We make such a good pair. But in order to play elegantly, we must look the part, don't you think? May I? I gave up on them years ago. There. Now... Let's see. Oh, your poor little hand. Oh, with such dry skin, these things, they happen sometimes. I'll get you a bandaid. All this worry, Mattie. I am not gonna switch your partner. I mean, just last night, she was gushing about you! And now all this business? Oh, honey, what is really going on with you? Well, I just... I mean, if you could just... Not this time. Now, where's that welcoming gal that I know you are? You're a sweet thing. I gotta go, baby. Bye bye. Okay. All right. I'll make a fruitcake. Am I early? We're still practicing? Yes, partner. Of course we are. Ah! Oh, no. That's a lovely color on you. Oh, I didn't... Thank you. Oh, and you. So beautiful. Well, I hardly know anything about you. Well, what is it you would like to know? Well, it sounds so silly. It's just that I see you around everywhere, and I, I- - Mm, yes, small towns are delightful that way, aren't they? Yes. Well, I'm probably just imagining things. I thought you whispered this thing. I'm sure that I'm not right, but it sounded almost like a threat. Oh. Oh, you are a such a timorous woman, Mattie Whalen. You frighten so very much. It is a wonder you manage to stick your head of your little pen. You see, where I am from, there are a great many sheep. And where there are sheep, of course there are dogs. And it is a curious thing, Mattie. Sometimes a dog will sneak into the sheepfold and begin to kill. Not for hunger. For play. For sport. But then it goes back in to its master and eats dog biscuits. Mm-hm? Do you understand me, Mattie? I haven't traveled very much. I can't imagine where Jenny and Linda are. It's so unlike them. You see, they it's something about the purebred passivity of the sheep that triggers something in the dog's brain. Something very old. Primal. They're blundering around in their pen, bleating in panic, too stupid to defend themselves, to act, to fight for their life. It's all just too much for the dog. It simply obeys instinct. Do you begin to see, Mattie? I don't. No, I don't. You are my sheep. And I am like the dog. Of course, a dog cannot wait to kill. But I can wait. I like to wait. When one person gets some good luck, someone else often get an equal share of bad. Make sure your intentions put you on the right side. Speaking of the right side. You're probably thinking, "Madam Josephine! That's a voodoo doll and they be evil." Bah. That's Hollywood movie nonsense. Poppets been around for ages. Since pharaohs ruled Egypt. They've been called many things through the years. Doll babies, effigies, dollies, fetishes. And yes, even voodoo dolls. No matter what you call it, a poppet is made to represent someone during magical workings. They can be made out of most anything. Wax, clay, soap. Roots, corn husks, metal, fruit. Even meat. I'm partial to cloth ones, myself. Whatever the material, it needs to be shaped like a human. Like attracts like. You're working sympathetic magic, so what you do to the poppet happens to your target. But the most important part of creating a poppet is the tag lock. A personal item that creates the magical link between the poppet and the target. The strongest tag locks are locks of hair, nail clippings and bodily fluids, but since people don't really wanna hand over those type of things, a photograph can do the trick. Then you name the poppet, to seal the link. I have made you, and you are Willie Bingham. Now all of that Hollywood mumbo jumbo got you thinking poppets are only used to do bad, but just like other magic, it's all about intention. If you want to work a spell of protection on someone, wrap their poppet in bubble wrap. To draw money to someone, tape dollar bills to their poppet. You can do works of healing, to bring love, and even to lose weight. But, yes. You can also stick pins in a poppet, to cause pain. Oh, I pray this customer use this poppet magic wisely. I remember two Willie Binghams. One, pasty-faced with fear after the sentence was read. And the other, after the series of amputations. The first is now blurred by the painfully sharp focus of the second. I was the very first surgical supervisor appointed under the state's revised stance on capital crime. My job? To see that medical protocol was followed. That inmates would not suffer any more than the usual post-surgical discomforts. - You're gonna remove my hair? - That is correct. No way! Well, you are a murderer, Mr. Bingham. Oi, Warden! Oi! No, sir, that is not fair! I killed that girl, but that weren't me! It was the booze. And the drugs. I killed her somethin' awful. They say I mutilated her! I never... The first surgery is largely symbolic. - Symbolic? - Correct. Well, a piece of cake, then. Nothing to worry about, huh? Well, I'm here to make sure you suffer no more pain than is necessary. Why don't you just do what they used to do, huh? Just bloody execute me! Once and for all! You're to be made a national example of. Your chance for recompense. It's expected that the reduction should cease by the second or third surgery. Come on, come on. Towel, please. Surviving family members determine how far the surgeries will go. Proceed. You can proceed. This is what my criminal ways got me. You best all mind yourselves, kids, hm? 'Cause you don't want this. No. You don't ever want this! Okay, mark it. In March, they removed Mr. Bingham's right arm and his left leg. Proceed. You may proceed. Swap. Mr. Bingham. Don't hurt none. Where's me supervisor? As Mr. Bingham's procedure advanced, he was exhibited to the more difficult cases in the underfunded state-run high schools. His hands. Behave yourselves, now. Unless you wanna look like me. Although Mr. Bingham was recovering well physically, his outlook grew progressively darker as the third surgery approached. The boys upstairs are very pleased with your progress, Willie. I don't the expect the family will take it any further. Every job hits patches of rough road. There are times I strain to glimpse the bitumen below it all. Murderer. Freak. Tensions continue to rise around the nation. Fresh protests erupted today over what many are now labeling a cruel and barbaric form of punishment. The man at the center of it all is 38-year-old inmate William Bingham, convicted of the rape and murder of a young schoolgirl earlier... Looks good. You may commence. Mr. Bingham gave up a kidney and a lung. Organs from inmates provide a small but steady revenue stream for our now privatized penal system. Nurse! Yes, Mr. Bingham? Are they cutting off my right leg or is that me left? It's your... Left leg, Mr. Bingham. - Left leg. - Left leg. Yeah. Five months later, the fifth surgery was ordered. Please don't do this. Now, now, Mr. Bingham. It will all be over soon. Mr. Bingham would lose his namesake. Willie. Willie. You okay? Are you in pain, Willie? Willie. I never saw Mr. Bingham cry after that day. Nor has he spoken to me since. He went into his final surgery without any observable emotion. They removed his ears, his nose and the tip of his tongue. A laser depilated what remained of his body. We've made through to the end now, Willie. That was five years ago. Mr. Bingham's room is the last on the southern end of the top floor. The light is always on. And I know he's there. Eyes to the ceiling. Dead silent. Except the last week of every month. That's when Mr. Bingham and I travel to the high schools. Messing with sympathetic magic to do harm is bad business. Any ill wishes may be reflected right back at you. Maybe not right away, but magic worked with grave intentions has a habit of coming home. If working with poppet feels too dangerous and you're looking to work magic that's more socially acceptable, consider using crystals. These colorful stones store the powerful energy of Mother Earth. And since intention is also energy, when you work with them, your intent is absorbed by the crystal. So make sure to choose one with properties that match your intention. For example. Clear quartz opens the mind, facilitates communication, and amplifies powers. This is why it's used to make crystal balls. And this here. Oh, this here's a lodestone which is a natural magnet. So if you want to draw something to you like money or love, a lodestone amplifies that intention. This customer is feeling despair about her life. Poor child. But I've got the perfect stone for her. And it's already set in a ring, so she can keep it with her. Alexandrite. It changes from green to red, depending on the light. So it brings hope by reminding us that life is not just the one thing it seems to be right now. When you first get a crystal, it's important to cleanse it of any energy it picked up from others who touched it. You do this by setting it in direct sunlight, or placing it in running water or burying it in the earth. Once any lingering psychic energies are gone, hold the crystal in your hand and charge it with your intent by directing your thoughts toward it. Then keep it close. I trust this will manifest the change she needs in her life. - Now, spray it. - Wait. No way. - Go ahead, spray it. - No. You're gonna spray it. What did it do to you, huh? Huh! Calm down, man. Chill out. Is this fucking funny, huh? What did it do to you? - It's not mine! - Huh? It's not yours? - It's not mine. - It's mine now. Huh? Cat! Yeah, what did the cat do to you? What did it do to you? What did it do? She's weird. Okay. It's okay, kitty. It's okay. Come on. Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Kitty! Please, no! Please! What did I do to you? What did I do to you? Suck my dick! What did I do? What did I do? What did I do? ♪ I didn't see it coming ♪ ♪ But it did, now it won't fade ♪ ♪ And I thought I'd see it coming ♪ ♪ But in a week and a day ♪ ♪ I was falling fast through that forest ♪ ♪ To a canopy of bliss ♪ ♪ Now a shadow in your room ♪ ♪ Gazing everything I'd miss ♪ ♪ And I flew to the moon ♪ ♪ And I, to mirror you ♪ ♪ And I, I saw the future ♪ ♪ I ♪ ♪ And I flew to the moon ♪ ♪ And I, to mirror you ♪ ♪ And I, I saw the future ♪ ♪ I ♪ ♪ Take me back to your room ♪ ♪ Close the curtains in the middle of the day ♪ ♪ And only open them for the moon ♪ ♪ Close the curtains in the middle of the day ♪ ♪ And only open them for the moon ♪ ♪ I flew to the moon ♪ Unfortunately, there's more to crystals than peace and tranquility. Their vibrational energy can be shaped by dark intentions. While alexandrite does boost hope, it can also cause over-focus and obsession. Now, if crystals feel too "suburban housewife" for you, you can try your luck with one of these. These powerful charms have been called many names in many cultures. Mojo hands, charm bags, prayer pouches, gri gri bags. Never mind what you call them. What they are is a spell in a bag. A hex you can carry with ya. The bags contain a mix of items like roots, herbs and minerals, animal parts, graveyard dirt, crystals and other items of spiritual value. Each item must have a specific purpose in the working and support the overall intent. This customer is asking for a boost of bravery. He needs extra courage and strength in his life, right now. For the bag itself, 'tis best to use flannel. Match the color the goal, just like with the candles. For this working, it'll be red, for courage. Now, you don't just dump the ingredients in a bag and be on your merry way. Each maker has their own special ritual for creating a bag. It might involve prayer or chanting or sigils, but the key is clearly visualizing the intent as you place each item. Start with a lodestone to draw the magic to you. Then a blood stone which vibrates with the energy of courage. Add dried thyme, which the Ancient Romans believed was a source of bravery. Then High John the Conqueror root, to draw strength and courage. And yarrow overcomes fears. And last. An arrowhead. As a symbol of protection, courage and strength. These charmed amulets should always have at least three items but no more than 13, odd numbers are best. Now, gently blow into the bag to breathe life into the talisman. Tie it together, while saying, "With these knots, I bind you to this purpose." When you get a spell bag, keep it close, wear it round your neck or keep it in your pocket or purse. Maybe even sleep with it under your pillow. Hopefully, this will give the customer the courage he needs. Happy birthday, Luke. 10? 11. Psst! Luke! Over here! If Mom sees me talking to you- - No, I know. She almost kicked Rango today, drunken bitch. Well, anyway. Here, happy birthday. Sorry about the glitter. I've been putting makeup on fairies in a commercial all day. It's chocolate. - Thank you, Susie. - You're welcome. Let me know if you need anything. Okay, hon? I'm here for you. Mom? Mom? Mom? Mom? Is that what you would do if you came home to find me dead? Standing there, doing nothing? Jesus Christ, you peed yourself. Go change before your dad gets home. Where's Daddy? Always Daddy with you, isn't it? How should I know? He doesn't tell me shit. Where's my birthday boy! Speak of the devil. - What happened? - It's not a big deal. I played dead as an emergency response test, which he failed, by the way. I mean, calling 911? How hard can it be? Don't look at me that way. I didn't think that he'd actually believe it. Right, Luke? My lucky Luke. You know I was just kidding, right? Come here, Luke. I'm so sorry. Things are gonna change around here. I promise! It was a joke. A joke! Why is everyone so god damn serious around here? Luke! Luke! Get up, Luke. School. John! John! Call 911! Mom? Mom! It's not real! See? It's just makeup. Susan helped me! Mom, it's a joke! Like yours! Never kid a kidder, kiddo! That bitch Susan is in so much trouble. I am talking police. I am talking lawsuits, I am... Happy birthday, Luke. Thanks. They opened it already. It's chocolate. You look good. Need anything, or... I'm fine. What? You seem different. What's going on? 10 years after mother died, the bitch came back. What? 10 years of nothing, and this morning, there she was. "Happy birthday, lucky Luke." You stopped taking your meds? Yeah, well, it's fine- - You can't stop taking your medications, Luke. You promised me. We have to tell Dr. Bertman. Your mother is dead. You know that, right? It's okay, Dad. I took care of it. What do you mean? Her. Off Interstate 278, she was hitching a ride. What did you do? What do you think? I killed her. Well, again. Oh, my god. She deserved it. You said so yourself. Oh, my god. Luke. Listen to me. You have to tell the police what you did, now. You understand? You're not well. You need help. Son, please. I thought we were in this together. We are. We were. But that was before you... You have to, we have to tell them the truth. All of it. Including what really happened that day. All right? Tell them everything. We made a mistake. Okay? We made a mistake, Luke. Okay. Guard? Listen. 10 years ago, my father told me to say that "Daddy killed Mommy", but he didn't. I did. He's innocent. Get it? I killed my mother. - Come on, this visit's over. - No, no, no, he did! - Come on. - I tried. Bye, Daddy. No, Luke! Luke, please, don't leave! Don't let him leave! He killed somebody! Luke! No, no, no, no! Call his doctor now! Luke! Please! Mom? Excuse me? You need a ride? Most believe bravery is a good thing, but sometimes it gives us the courage to do something bad. That's why you must be clear and specific with your intentions! I've shown you some traditional tools for amplifying intentions, but sometimes, folks are looking for something a little more subtle? They don't want to advertise they're using magic. Or they want to give a gift to help, or hurt, someone, without them knowing. If this be the case, you can infuse ordinary objects with magical energy. When you charge an item with a specific purpose, you enchant it, creating a talisman. Charge a pillow case with sweet dreams. A pair of dice with luck. A toothbrush with an "all is well" blessing. Pretty much anything can be a vessel for your intentional energy. This talisman is for a child in need of protection. So it must be something that can be close by, without raising suspicion. There are many rituals for enchanting, but you now know the most important part of any spell or rite is intent. So, I like to keep it simple. Hold the item in your hands and curl your fingers round it. Clear your mind. Connect to the power of the earth below, and the air above. Keep your intent clear in your mind. Now visualize a light of the color associated with your goal. Since we're infusing this item with protection, the light will be black. Breathe in. Breathe out. Now direct the light energy in your mind into the object. Picture it flowing down your arms and pouring from your hands into the item. Visualize the object growing brighter and brighter as it fills with your energy. Then speak your intent aloud. Protect her. Time for your nap. I'm not sleepy yet. When you wake up, you still have a lot of chores and homework to do. But I can do those things now. It will be better if you rest first. That way you'll have energy when you wake up. Okay, mom. I'm sorry I can't give you a better life. That's okay. I'm happy as long as we're together. I promise to study and work hard. Someday I'll buy you a house and lot. Really, a house and lot? Where did you learn these things? From the neighbors. I heard they're finally moving out. Sweetie, do good in school. I want you to get away from this place. Start a new life. I have faith you'll be able to do that someday. Just as long as we're together, mom. Okay, now go to sleep. Don't leave me, okay? I'll never ever leave you. Marian, it's late. Time to wake up. Marian. Marian, get up. I need your help. Marian! Marian hurry up, or you're going to get in trouble! I won't get mad at you. Come down. What took you so long? Sorry, it was hard to get out of bed. That's okay. Come on. Help me downstairs. Goddammit! What's taking you so long? I need you to be quiet, okay? Marian are you coming down or not? Don't wait for me to come up there! If I get my hands on you, I'm going to beat you up! Open the door. Marian, what the hell? Open the door! You're so stubborn. You useless animal. I told you to me help me downstairs you can't even do that. Why is it so hard for you to follow orders? You're a pain in the ass! - Please stop! Please stop! Son of a bitch! Mama. What? Mama. What the heck, Marian? It's been over a year. Your mom died a long time ago. She's never coming back. I hate you! Do you think I wanted this? Do you think you're the only one having a hard time? You have no idea of the shit I'm going through. I'm so sick of it! I'll never call you my mom. Thank God for that! Your mom was a whore, she left you with me! You're just like her, you ungrateful brat! Go ahead, cry. Cry. Cry. Cry some more! Cry. Go downstairs and help me. Auntie. Auntie, wake up. Auntie. Auntie, wake up. Marian. Marian, I'm sorry about earlier. I didn't mean to... Protection comes in many forms. And sometimes that form just happens to be yourself. Some folks think magic is ridiculous, but magic be all around us. It's the energy that connects us and the way we manipulate that energy through our intentions. to find what you need to harness this intentional energy. But remember what they say. "The road to hell is paved with good intentions." So where does the road lead, when your intentions are grave? ♪ I flew to the moon ♪ ♪ And I, to mirror you ♪ ♪ And I, I saw the future ♪ ♪ I ♪ ♪ I flew to the moon ♪ ♪ And I, to mirror you ♪ ♪ And I, I saw the future ♪ ♪ I ♪ ♪ I saw the future ♪ ♪ I saw the future ♪ ♪ I saw the future ♪
