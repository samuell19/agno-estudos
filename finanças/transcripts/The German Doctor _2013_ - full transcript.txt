Lilith! The first time we met he thought I was a perfect specimen... ...except for my height. In his notebook he wrote: "Mysterious harmony in her imperfect measurements. " Desert Road, Patagonia, 1960 The heart goes there. Can I have her? Of course. She's yours. What's her name? - Wakolda. - Wakolda. Aren't you a little old to be playing with dolls? How old do you think I am? Nine? Ten? - I'm twelve. - Twelve? - Sorry. - That's ok. I'm used to it. To what? Being older than people think. Lilith, come here. Hold this. - Are you heading south? - Yes. Give me that. Can I follow you? It seems the road is... Yes, 300 kilometers of nothing. You should ask my dad. Here he comes. He wants to follow us. - If it's not a problem. - Of course, no problem. All foreigners are scared of this road. You can't take it at night. We have to get there before dark. Let's get going. He's going to follow us in his car. Helmut Gregor. Pleased to meet you. Did you buy supplies? I had breakfast an hour ago. - You'd better buy something. - Ok, thanks. Did you know the Grammostola mollicoma can live up to 30 years? Female spiders shed their skin once a year. What does "shed" mean? - What does it mean? - I don't know, Polo. What does "shed" mean? Polo, let me sleep! Dad! THE GERMAN DOCTOR We have to pull over. Stay here. Sorry to barge in like this. We'll leave after the storm. I don't have much to offer, but you can came in. Come on, everybody out! - She was so scared that she died. - No! Why would she be scared? Everything's fine. - Tell her not to be scared. - Don't be scared. It's dried meat. She's not dead. You see? She's moving. She's just shedding her skin, that's why she's so still. - There are lots of insects here. - Here? A little gift for you. - That's not necessary. - I don't need it. - Say "Thank you". - Thank you. Go and look for them. How come you speak German? - I went to a German school. - In Buenos Aires? Bariloche. - Are you from there? - My parents were. My mother died two months ago. They had a hotel. We want to reopen it. - Do they speak German too? - They understand. Does he? I don't speak or understand. Hold it like so. I shouldn't be talking to you. I'm not allowed... ...to talk to strangers. Then we should say goodbye. Mum says I do everything that's off limits. Is it true? Sort of. I'd do some things even if they weren't off limits. Would you talk to me? I think so. You think so, but you're not sure. Yes, I'm sure. Lilith, come here. Get back to bed. We're stopping here. Bariloche is 30 kilometres from here. - Where are you going? - I'll show you. That's in the town. Keep going straight. - Take care. - Thanks for everything, Enzo. Wait! Come here! - Can we go to the lake? - Come on, champ. Let's go now. - Are they still coming? - More and more. They come and go in that plane. They never leave the neighbour's house. Here you go. Paint the other eyebrow. - Are you sure? - Yes, here. Take this brush. Hold it close to the bristles... ...pressing against the doll to steady your hand. - Like this? - That's perfect. Look. My parents had up to 20 employees. How are we supposed to manage? When will we open? As soon as we can. Can you spot me? Can you? This one. How old were you? Ten, I think. Come here. Look at tour mum. I want to show you something. Was that your school? Yes. And she'll be your teacher. Are we going to your old school? But, I don't speak German! You'll soon learn. Now, dear parents, we ask you, to leave your children in our hands. The second term has begun. See you later. Eva! I'm Klaus Baier. - Klaus! What are you doing here? - I'm a tutor here. I'll be teaching these two some discipline. Thet don't speak German. - But they understand. - Yes. Excuse me. - The new student. - Hello. - What's your name? - Lilith. - How do we welcome her? - Welcome, Lilith. This group is learning German. Sit down over there. We are the... - ... transition group. - Good, let's continue. Ana, please conjugate the verb "to go". I go / you go. He / she / it goes. We go... There they are. Every day the nurses take them out for a walk. - Why is he bandaged? - They operated on him. - Is the owner of the house a doctor? - A surgeon. - How about him? - A patient. Hello. Did you hurt yourself? It's nothing. Is your father home? Go get him. Your wife told me you're planning to reopen the hotel. In two weeks. I'd like to stay here. No. - Didn't you have a place to stay? - It doesn't compare to this. I'd be honoured to be your first guest. I spoke to my wife on the phone yesterday. She plans to join me once I'm settled in. The rooms aren't ready yet. I can pay in advance. Six months. Are you sure you're only 15 weeks pregnant? That's what the doctor said. You're too big for 15 weeks. - Was it the same with the others? - With Tom?s and the youngest. And Lilith? She was two months premature. Do you know how I feel? As though I've come home. Did you grow up here? I was born here. Your key. You can have dinner with us tonight. Can you cut my meat up for me, Mum? What is your speciality? Cattle. - To improve the breed with hormones. - One cow at a time? Only pregnant cows and calves. We stimulate the production of a protein that the body produces naturally, but in smaller doses. What kind of hormones? Growth hormones. If you're a doctor, why do you work with animals? We test our findings on animals first to see if they work. - And if it doesn't work? - It always works. Genetics is a complex science, but it has simple explanations. We search for what geneticists call "the founder effect". If there's a clear hereditary pattern, we can improve the race. That night he wrote in his notebook: "Two months premature. Pneumonia till age three. "Persistent minor asthma. "Influenza, tonsillitis, and chronic sinusitis. " For my brother, he wrote: "Homo Europeans. Normal pregnancies". DOLL HOSPITAL BARILOCHE VETERINARY CLINIC Everything you asked for is here: Microscope, X-ray machine, and a freezer. I'll empty out half of it tonight. I need the whole space. And I want it padlocked. Of course. Do we have a colleague at the hospital? Several. Call this number and have them order this. It'll be sent as medical supplies. I'll do it immediately. We'd like to have a welcome party for you. There's no need for that. You needn't pay for a lodging house. Any one of us would be honoured... I'm fine there. I'll let you know if I need anything. - What are you doing here? - She's here to see me. Do you work here? With animals? Among other things. - What's this? - Blood. Look. There's nothing more mysterious than blood. Do you want to see yours? - Will it hurt? - Not at all. Careful! "BLOOD AND HONOUR" What does blood have to do with honour? Mixed blood is impure. It destroys memory. To remember what? Who we were. - Who were we? - Sonnenmenschen. Have you ever had an X-ray? What for? To see how much more you can grow. It's a picture of your bone. We'll take your knee and your hand. Now don't breathe and don't move. Could I grow more? With a little help. SONNENMENSCHEN What are you looking for? A Dictionary. Thank you. You won't find it there. "Sonnenmenschen"? Come with me. Here they are. SONNENMENSCHEN Are they superman? Sort of. Nine! Zero! Zero! Zero! Ten! Seven! It's just a game. They rate the girls' bodies. They gave you a zero. Next. It's your turn. Come on! Come on, it's your turn. Remember to keep your hands up. - Lilith, jump into the pool! - Go ahead. Let's jump together. - Where are you going after this? - To Ushuaia. Are you going alone? I always do. So, no one's waiting for you? No one's waiting for me. There he is. Just a moment. Welcome. Let me introduce you to some of our friends. Mr. and Mrs. Steffen. They're teachers at the school. These people came here specially for this event. Nora Eldoc is an archivist and photographer. - She works at the school. - Nice to meet you. Come. No! No! No, you stay there! ISRAELI AGENTS SEARCHING FOR MENGELE - You wanted to see me? - Oh, Eva... Yes. The vitamins, and the iron complex. You'll feel better in a few days. Thank you. - Have more guests arrived? - Two more families. You shouldn't be going up and down the stairs. Fine. Thank you for the pills. Have you had your daughter examined - to see if there's still time? - Time for what? To make her grow. Medicine can't change that. There are treatments... ...if done in time... ...that could spur her growth to a normal height. Now is the time to begin treatments. Once her body begins producing oestrogen... ...the hormone will be half as effective. Look at this. Your daughter's knee joints. Her bones are the age... ...of an 8-year-old, not a 12-year-old. She's below the second percentile. She's growing one or two centimetres a year... ...instead of eight, which is normal. Her cartilage... - Who told him to do these tests? - He wants to help us. We don't need his help. Lilith doesn't, and neither do we. Tell him that. - He will not experiment on her. - It's not an experiment. - Coming! - They use the same hormone on people. - Where's the proof? - If we wait, it will be too late. There are no risks. There are always risks, no matter what he says. He's a guest, nothing more. He's not the family doctor. THE F?HRER'S BIRTHDAY PARTY BARILOCHE, 1959 Do underground cities really exist? Where the Sonnenmenschen are waiting? Who puts these ideas in your head? Your parents? Your friends? Do you finish it? Put it in that box. Are you going to spend every recreation here? - Are they that mean to you? - A little. Then you can help me. Sit there. I was the shortest too at your age. Write: Number 7. Photographs... ...of the school's founding. Quiet, children. Quiet. These three boxes. - Please. - Everything you wanted removed is in there. So, that's where the dwarf was hiding. Get lost! I'll see you tonight. FIRST EICHMANN, THEN MENGELE Dad wanted to make a doll with a mechanical heart. He liked each one to be different. So did I. That's why I chose Wakolda. She was the most unusual of them all. Just like me. - Dad? - Hmm? I want to have the treatment. I talked to Mum. I'm not scared. You don't need any treatment. But I'm the shortest. Always. There's always someone taller or fatter... ...with blonder hair... We're not all the same. Everyone is unique. Get me one of these. May I come in? Have you ever considered mass-producing them? To bring these designs to life? It'd be too expensive. Not if you found an investor. Who would do that? I would. It's a good business proposition. Think about it. Helmut... No tests will be done on my daughter without my permission. Got it? I thought you'd missed school today. They put me in the German group. Hey there, dwarf! They made fun of her all day. You'll feel a little prick. Did that hurt? Hold it there. How did you convince him? Once she's grown a few centimetres, we'll tell him. Now a few measurements. - May I? - Yes. Put your hand here. What if I don't grow? You will. Has there never been anyone else in your family... ...who was shorter than normal? Great-grandfather, grandfather, uncle? No one. Maybe there's something I did wrong during the pregnancy? Certain hereditary diseases, only manifest themselves in certain generations. Why? Recessive genes. You should take care of yourself. Mothers who have given birth prematurely once, tend to do so again. May I? - Yes. - Lie down, please. There are two, aren't there? Is everything ok? Just fine. That day they confirmed that there were two babies. Mum trusted him. The vitamins he gave her made her feel much better. Now he could finally test his growth hormones. He'd already tried them on cattle. Now he had the twins. - Where's Polo? - With Tom?s. Eva! This is Nora, the photographer I told you about. - Hello, how are you? - Fine, thanks. I can take her to the hotel tomorrow. Smile! Hold still. Tom?s, a bit more to the right. - That's good. - Many thanks. That photographer... Yes? Is she someone we can trust? She comes from the capital with the highest recommendations. You've arrived. - Hello. - Here's what you wanted. Can you give me a ride into town? - I have a favour to ask. - What can I do for you? Do you know where I can make porcelain moulds here? May I ask what for? Dolls. - Stay in the car! - Leave her alone. When was it blown up? Two years ago. During the night. By the Argentinian army. A lot of people say that F?hrer didn't die. That he's hiding in a bunker like this one. I dreamt about him last night. He was living in a dark passageway, underground. As if he'd been buried alive. - Nora? - Coming! - What's the matter? - You won't let me down, will you? In front of who? In front of my friends. I told them you were trustworthy. You are, aren't you? 451 Avenue Belgrano. It's a hotel. He's staying there. He's not in Paraguay. He's here. If you don't come for him, he'll leave. I don't care what they say. I'm sure it's him. Happy birthday, sweetie! Let's dance! Tango! It's a model based on your designs. - You gave him my sketches? - It was a surprise. - Where was it made? - In a factory in Trelew. How many should they start with? Two hundred? Look at your face! - What is it? - Nothing. - Does it hurt? - No. How much? Almost two centimetres. What are those drawings? My family. Poets write about what they see. Painters paint. I measure and weight what interests me. Do we interest you? You do. That day I told him that I could feel pain... ...in my arms and legs. He said it was a good sign, and he doubled the dose. In his notebook he wrote; "Signs of pubescence". He said my body was a battlefield... ...that pain was good. She has a fever. Put Polo to bed. What is this? It's a little allergy and a fever. It's normal. Normal? You said there'd be no side effects. She's grown three centimetres. Much more than anyone could have expected. I don't want to continue. The treatment can't be stopped now. I can talk to your husband if you're worried. There's nothing to talk about. I'll reduce the dose. Her fever will be gone in two days. Come on, Otto. Let's go. - I'm cold. - Let me show you something. I found it yesterday. Goal! Are you ok? You think you're smart? Otto! Otto! - Don't mess with our things! - Shut up! What are you doing here? This is our school! You've got no business here. You're a dwarf! A dwarf! - They're coming! - Now, is that clear? Huh? Piss off, arsehole! You picked a fight with a classmate. That's not on. I won't tolerate that. You are expelled from this school. There's no place for people like you. You are expelled! We need order, calm and peace. We need discipline, not troublemakers. Got it? It's just not on! I'm sorry, but you'll have to find another school. You can go home. Otto said you weren't involved. You wait here. Dad tried out his inventions. He changed the handcrafted eyes for mobile glass eyes. He changed the flax hair for human hair. Even the hands moved. He convinced my dad to make perfect dolls... ...all of them identical. To a business that will stay in the family, even after I'm gone. Cheers. Do you feel ok? Several buyers are interested. We can name our price. Why? Because they're unique. I mean, why are you spending your time and money on dolls? I appreciate beauty. They'll be ready tomorrow morning. - We'll send them disassembled. - If you like. They need some final touches. Lips, tongues, eyebrows. Do you want any distinguishing marks? - Beauty spots or birthmarks? - No. I want them spotless. And this... ...is the heart that beats. - Can I finish one? - Of course. Excuse me. You're burning up. Where are we? In a hotel. We took a little trip, remember? - No. - Cover up. You should be covered. - Does that itch? - It's good. - What's good? - He told me. Who told you? What? Let me look at it. It's good. Let me see what's bothering you. - Let me see. - It's good. - What's bothering you? - It's a good sign. What's a good sign? I'm growing. What did you do to my daughter? What are you doing to her? Your wife and daughter gave me their permission. - She's grown three centimetres. - I don't give a damn! Don't you ever touch her again! Never again! I want you out of my house. - What's happening? - She's had the twins. They're not breathing properly. - When were they born? - Two hours ago. - Isa's gone for the doctor. - They won't make it in this snow. Turn up the heat. They need oxygen. I need to examine them. Go next door. They have everything I need. Give this to whoever opens the door. You, come with me! Stay with your mother. Don't leave her alone with him. Get in the car. It was on the radio. They took him out of the country on an EL AL flight. They say he was held for a week in Buenos Aires. There are more of them. - Agents? - Israelis. They're after us. - Someone's here. - What is this place? I don't know. The air isn't getting into the lungs. The lungs aren't fully developed. That's why he's breathing like this. How will I feed them? I don't have any milk. I've asked for formula to start out. Then you'll nurse them. You've done this before, haven't you? Hundreds of times. Then tell me if they'll live. First they have to make it through the night. Enzo knows. He knows everything. The Israeli Prime Minister has declared that the manhunt is on. - Is that what he said? - Yes. I'm going for a doctor. You won't find anyone better than him. All the roads are closed because of the storm. Take that tank. Ten milliliters, twice every four hours. I'm sorry they caught him. Caught who? Eichmann. Israeli agents captured him yesterday. Where is he now? In Israel. They asked me to tell you that there's a plane waiting, to take you away from here. Not yet. There'll be other twins. - Where's Lilith? - In her room. I'm taking them to the hospital. Now? No, you can't take them out. This is the best place for them. With him. I don't care who he is. I do. I care who he is. I wanted to be as tall as the girl in his drawing. He said it was tough to force a body to grow... ...when it's not in its nature. He knew. He'd seen it in other species. In his notebok he wrote that he would only help the weakest. - Are they taking the milk? - Yes. Yes, the bigger one has regulated his breathing and temperature. Heart rate? 140 per minute. 36.8 degrees. - And the smaller one? - 150 per minute, and 36.4 degrees. Fine. 25 milliliters, four times a day... ...for the bigger one... ...one spoon of milk, and two spoons of water. And for the smaller one... ...two spoons of milk... ...and one spoon of water. And sugar. - Are you sure? - Yes. Sugar? Absolutely. We've talked to our contacts in Paraguay. They're expecting you. I can't leave yet. I have things to do here. You're no longer safe. Everything's been arranged. Have all the documents you need. His sucking reflex is weak. He has trouble breathing and eating at the same time. Do you have milk? Very little. In two days you'll have all you need. We'll mix your milk with the formula. We'll give him ten milliliters, but every three hours now. The doctor wants to examine them. The doctor is not allowed in this room. He's leaving today. Excuse me. I'd like a picture with them. Can you get the photographer? He arrived in Argentina in 1952, and disappeared in Buenos Aires. With a Red Cross passport, obtained through the Vatican... How come no one knew? In Buenos Aires, no one knew. His crusade for an Aryan race, sent six milion Jews to the gas chambers. Argentina is demanding information about the kidnapping, while Israel has declared that the manhunt has just begun. You can set up the camera. It's the name you requested. HELMUT GREGOR Good. Who is he? He's always done this. Using one baby as a control and experimenting on the other. Nora, are you here to take pictures of the twins? What kinds of photos do you like, other than the school photos? All kinds. - Forensic? - Excuse me? Have you ever taken photos of a corpse? Once. Five hikers who had got lost. Do you think someone can guess that he's living his last hours? Do you plan to die soon? Not yet, I still have things to do. It's an obsession I have every time I see a corpse. - When you pull the trigger. - It's not a gun, it's a camera. When you took that photo, what did you see in their eyes? Resignation or struggle? Both. I imagine those hikers kept fighting until the end, even without the slightest hope. In the mountains the dead are always found with their eyes open. Death takes them by surprise. The cold creeps into their bones. It kills you when you think you can still keep going. Don't worry. Nobody knows they're living their last hours. Some men are coming for me. Bring them here. Tell them this is a gift from me. Why? Because I'm asking you to. So? You'd do anything for me, wouldn't you? No. You wouldn't? You will soon forget me. - Subtitle - Sync, fix: titler Mengele escaped the Mossad for nearly 30 years. He continued experimenting on children and pregnant women. Nora Eldoc was murdered the next day. Her body was found buried in the snow, with her eyes open. Mengele drowned in 1979 in Bertioga, Brazil.
