There's power. Very few men have the power this woman has. Gentlemen, I propose a toast. I drink to you, Mr Drummle. To your good health, Bentley! I apologise if anything disagreeable... Oh, no, no. That's all right. - I do like that Spider fellow, though. - Do you? I don't. No. No, you're right, of course. Stay as clear of him as you can. He does have great promise, though. Indeed, if I were a fortune teller. But I'm not a fortune teller. You know what I am, don't you? Go 10 bed, Pip. Good night. Sir. Come on! Come on, sir! Get up! Someone 10 see you, sir. Pepper, I've told you I'm not to be woken unless the... How are you, Pip? I brought you a toasting fork as a present, you know, for crumpets and the like. But I see you have no need. That's... It's perfect, Joe. Thank you. - Tea or coffee, sir? - Oh! Tea, sir, please, if you don't mind. I find the coffee a little powerful. - Us two now being alone, sir... - Sir? Joe, how can you call me sir? Us two being now alone, Pip, I might tell you the reason for me being in the abode of a gentleman, which is that I've had a communication with a certain Miss A. Miss A? Joe? Miss 'Avisham. She wishes to see you on a matter of great import. Joe, this is my good friend Herbert Pocket. - Mr Gargery, I've heard a great deal about you. - Nice to meet you. Oh? What is there to say? A very great deal. Now, suppose we have a celebration? It takes some getting used to, eh, Joe? Now, this place may look a little rough but don't be deceived. In my opinion, this is the finest place in London. Oh, and the pressed duck is superb. Let him take it, Joe. Joe. How do you find London, Mr Gargery? London! What a place! What a place! Course, I wouldn't keep a pig in it myself. Biddy sends her regards. She's a teacher now, a good one. She taught me. Fork. F-O-R-K. Knife. N-I-F-E. I know it's not! - More wine, Mr Gargery? - Yes, please. Joe, please. There's really no need to be so conscientious in emptying your glass. The rim should never touch your nose, Joe. Gentlemen, if you'll excuse me. Well, business concluded, I'll be off. - You're going now? - Yes, lam. - Please, put your money away, Joe. - No. No, I insist. - You will not stay the night? - No, I won't. Sir! Sir! For God's sake, Joe, put your money away! Joe! - At least, let me walk you to the coach. - I'll find my way. But we have barely spoken, Joe. I wished to show you some sights. You and me are not two figures to be together in London. I'm wrong outside the forge, and the kitchen and the marshes. You come sometime and you put your head in at the window at the forge and you'll see Joe the blacksmith, and what larks we'll have! But here, Pip, here I am most awful dull. So God bless you, dear old Pip, old chap. God bless you! You know the way. Pip. How do you do? You kiss my hand as if I was a queen. - You wished to see me? - Mm. Pip. I am to be sent 10 London. I am to go on show, myself and the jewels. Do you wish to go on show? Why ask? We have no choice, you and I, but to obey instructions. I watched you, you know, that day. Fighting for my honour. I must have been a strange little creature to hide and watch, but I did. I enjoyed it very much. You rewarded me very much. Did I? You kissed me. Poor Pip. You imagine yourself a young knight from a child's story, tearing away the cobwebs and thorns, letting in the sunshine. Marrying the princess. But you must know, Pip, I have no heart. I don't believe it. How can there be beauty without a heart? Oh, I have a heart to be stabbed in or shot in, and if it ceased to beat, I should cease to be. But there's no softness there. No sym path? Sentiment. Nonsense. I've been made that way. - Oh, I... - I am serious, Pip. If we're to be thrown together, you must believe me. For both our sakes. I'm sorry, I cannot. I will not. Very well. It is said at any rate. Come, Miss Havisham will be expecting you at your old post. Is she beautiful? Is she graceful? Is she well-grown? Do you admire her? - Of course. - Then love her. Love her, Pip. If she wounds you, love her. If she fails you, love her. If she tears your heart to pieces, as it gets older, it will tear deeper, but love her, love her, love her! I adopted her to be loved. I bred her to be loved. I educated her and I developed her into what she is. You know what love is, Pip? It is blind devotion. It is self-humiliation. It is degradation. It is utter submission, giving up your heart and soul as I did to that man. Miss Havisham! Enough excitement for one day. Pip, you've been requested to escort Estella to London in the morning. I suggest an early night. Miss Havisham. Shall we take a trip? Once round? # Old Clem, with a thump and a sound # Old Clem # Beat it out, beat it out # Old Clem with a... # Mrs Brandley is to be paid a large sum of money to introduce me to society. The jewels and I. - We are to be shown to people... - Hurry up! ...and people are to be shown to us. - And may I come and see you? - Of course. Miss Havisham expects it. If my time permits. I see bills from vintners, bills from jewellers, from bookmakers. I suspected you would go wrong, Pip, but really you are excelling yourself. I'll endeavour to show more restraint. Oh, do as you will, it's no business of mine. Will you make sure that Mr Pip gets the money he requires. Thank you, Wemmick? Excuse me. Ah. Good day to you, sir. Please come into my office. So good to see you again. Finches, Finches, I would like to raise a glass to a lady of my acquaintance. Ooh! A lady of Richmond. A peerless beauty. Miss Estella Havisham! - Miss Estella Havisham! - I know that lady. Do you? Oh, Lord And you know nothing of her! Well, on the contrary, I've had the pleasure of dancing with her. - Several times. - You lie! Steady now, Handel. Indeed. Then perhaps you might care to follow me. Out of my way! Out of my way! Out of my way! Step away from the lady, sir. A waltz! - The dance is not yet over. - Remove your hand, sir. Oh, hard luck. Come on. Pip, will you never take warning? - How can you do it, Estella? - What? Give your affections to that man. All sorts of ugly creatures hover about a lighted candle. - Can the candle help it? - No, but you can. Perhaps. If I cared. But you must care! To encourage a man as despised, as unworthy and boorish as Bentley Drummle. And this is a man who has nothing to recommend him except money... Pip, don't let it affect you so. I can't help it! To give that man the looks and smiles you never give to me... Do you want me to deceive you? - Do you deceive him? - Yes! Yes, him and many, many other men. All men. All men but you. And why am I to be spared? Why do you think? Lovely evening, isn't it? A storm later, so they say. Estella, Mr Drummle requires your presence. Urgently. Hello? Herbert? You're back early! Who's there? Who are you? Wait, wait, wait. Shh. Wait. How'd you get in here? Good God. What are you... You acted noble, my boy. Noble and I have never forgot it. Look, if you're grateful to me for what I did as a boy, it's not necessary. - Really. You must understand. - What must I understand? That I cannot renew our acquaintance. My life has changed since then. Now, I'm glad that you're well and you've repented. But really, you must go. Please. How about a drink first? Before I go. How have you been living? A sheep farmer, stock breeder, in the New World. Many a thousand mile off. - You've done well? - I've done wonderful well. Seems, you've done well, too. Yes. Yes. No, I have. Thank you. I would like, if I may, to give you this gift. A token. For old times. Before you go. There's your gift. Might a varmint make so bold as to ask you, how you've done well... Since we were anthem marshes? Mmmm? I've come into some property. And might he ask whose property? No, I cannot say her name. There are conditions. Conditions? Could I make a guess as to your income? Might the first figure be a... A five? - How could you... - And you would have had a guardian? A lawyer, maybe, with a name beginning with a... J? A J, perhaps, who might have sent me your address when I landed in Portsmouth? Mr Jaggers, perhaps? Yes, dear boy. Yes. I've made a gentleman of you. I swore that time as sure as I ever earned a guinea, that guinea should go to you. No... I lived rough that you should live smooth. I worked hard that you should be above work. I made you! I'm your, your father, Pip. No. No, no, no. You are not my father! No, no. Your second father, then. You're my son. No... No, you're more to me than any son. Look at you, dear boy! Look at these lodgings. They're fit for a lord. And yeah, this watch and this ring and your linen and your clothes. And your, your books, too. Oh! You read them all, have you? You shall read them to me... And I shall be so proud, to think that I'm the maker of such a man. I must sleep, long and sound. It's a long time since I slept. You'll keep watch, dear boy? Cos, look here. Here. Caution is necessary. I was sent for life. It's death to come back. I should be hanged if took. You risked your life to come to me? That's right, dear boy. I... I don't even know your name. Magnum. Abel Magwitch. Well, is it true? Do not commit yourself. Do not tell me anything, I do not want... - Is what I've been told true? - "Told" implies verbal communication. You cannot have verbal communication with a man in New South Wales. - I was always led to believe... - Nothing. Nothing. You believed what you chose to believe. Mmm-hmm? It's not my responsibility. Now, I understand you have an uncle staying with you. Yes? Yes? - Yes. - Right. May I, suggest you buy him some new clothes, advise him to spend most of his time in your rooms and perhaps have a haircut. Yes? Meanwhile, if you are writing to your friend in New South Wales, you may choose to send him that. The balance of our accounts. Mmm-hmm? My services are ended. Good day, Mr Pip. All that time, in Satis House, I was just a... A mechanical heart to practise on. Estella was never meant for me at all. And you, my "guardian", have known this all along. Well... You may as well hear this from me as anyone else. Um... The Spider has played his hand. Can I help you? - Open this gate, Drummle, or I swear... - Why, it's the smithy's boy! Don't lose your temper, smithy's boy. Seems to me you've lost quite enough already. Pip? - Pip. - Oh, enough! What I have to say to Estella I will say before you. But, Miss Havisham... When you first took me from my home, I came as a kind of servant, to gratify a whim and be paid for it. Yes. And when I fell into my mistake of imagining that you were my benefactor... Yes, I... Let you go on. Was that kind? Kind? Who am I to be kind? No, it amused me... To punish my relations. You were adequately paid, I believe. What else do you want? Estella. You know I love you. I have loved you since I first saw you in this house. Foolishly, I had hoped that Miss Havisham had meant us for each other. Clearly the idea was absurd, and I hope Miss Havisham will take what pleasure she can in knowing that I am as unhappy as she ever meant me to be. These are sentiments, emotions that I am unable to comprehend. When you say you love me, I understand it as a form of words but it touches nothing here. - I don't believe you. - Did I not warn you? - Yes. - Did you not think I meant it? - No. It's not natural! - It is natural in me! And yet still I love you. I know that I'll never call you mine, Estella, yet still I love you. I love you and I beg you do not marry Bentley Drummle. Someone else, anyone, but not that brute. Too late. It's too late. I am going to marry him. The preparations are already under way. - You can't let Miss Havisham... - it is my own act. Miss Havisham has urged me to wait, to reconsider. But I am tired of my life. We will do well enough. Give me your hand. Be happy, Pip. This will pass in time. I'll be out of your thoughts in a week. Out of my thoughts? You're in every thought. You're part of my existence. Pan of me. You're in every thought, in every line I have ever read since I first came here. You're in the river, the sails of ships, the sea, the clouds, the stones of London. Until the last hours of my life, you will remain in me... Part of the little good, part of the evil. And I will always think of the good. Goodbye. God bless you. So proud, so hard. I am what you have made me! You are my mother, and yet I have never seen your face by daylight. Since I was a baby, you taught me that there was no such thing as daylight, that it had blighted you... And it would blight me, too, if I let it. Well... I am what you made me. This is what you made me. Estella... Come with me now. I'd like to help Mr Pocket. He has been a loyal and decent friend and I'd like to use the money that remains to do one good thing. I'd like to purchase him a position. Without his knowledge. Allowing for debts, which are substantial, I might add, that's 500, sir. - All invested in a friend? - Yes, yes. Every last penny. What's your advice? Well, sir, if I was in the office, I would suggest that you take that 500, and choose your bridge. There are six to choose from up as high as Chelsea Reach and throw the money off it. You'll lose it just the same, but it will be quicker and less painful. Those would be my sentiments, in the office. But your home sentiments, your... Your Walworth sentiments? My Walwonh sentiments... Would be... I'm gonna see what I can do. - Let go of me! - Magwitch! Leave him! Magwitch! He wishes to buy us a house! In Hyde Park! - A coach, horses... - Can't you accept? How can I? I've seen him try to murder a man. He might have murdered you. And yet, he risked his life to find you. He says I am the son he's never had. The idea appals me, Herbert, but even so, he must not be captured... Gentlemen. Now, I ain't gonna tell you my life like a song or a story book, but give it to you short and handy. In jail, out of jail. lnjail, out of jail. That's my life... Until I met my boy here. I've been done everything to except hanged. I've ramped and begged and thieved, poached... Anything that doesn't pay and leads to trouble. And then a matter of 20 years ago, when I was out of money and out of luck, not that I'd been in it much, I meta man. At Epsom races. His name... was Compeyson. - Compeysun? - Compeyson. I'm sorry. Go on. A gentleman was Compeyson, a smooth one, good-looking too, went to boarding school. He was younger than me but he'd got craft and he'd got learning. He and his missus had a plan... Involving the defrauding of a certain lady by her half-brother. It weren't much of a plan to my mind, but I played my part... I played my part in a small way. I can't say I'm proud of it. Well done, Abel. I had a missus, too, at that time. - You were married? - No matter. That was a dark time, that time with Compeyson. Always in debt to him, always under his thumb, always getting into danger, always working, for years and years, till I was his black slave. The short of it is, we got committed for felony, putting forged notes into circulation. "Separate defences," Compeyson says. "No communication." I sold everything but the clothes on my back so I could get Jaggers, for all the good it did me. Says the counsel for Compeyson, wasn't he the younger and well brought up and of a good school? - Wasn't he... - A gentleman of a county of Shropshire... A gentleman? Given your persistence and your malign influence... And when the verdict came, wasn't it Compeyson as was recommended for mercy on account of good character and bad company and all the damn'd lies he'd given up against me? And wasn't it me as never got a word... - But to find you guilty. - Guilty. - Guilty. - Order! Order! Guilty. For how long? 14 years. He got two. And a few months on, he turns up on my prison ship. I swore to the Lord, I'd smash his face in... And I did. And then, thinking, hoping, that he'd drowned, I swam to the shore and was hiding among the graves there, envying them that were in them... And my boy here found me. My boy. - Is he dead? - Who? Compeyson. He'll wish I am, if he's alive. And he'll wish he was, if I find him. - And the lady he defrauded. Her name was... - 'Avisham. Miss 'Avisham. I need you to tell me about Compeyson. Clever fellow Dangerous. - Is he still alive? - To my knowledge, yes. I would strongly advise your uncle to pack his bags. If he's found, he will hang. And it's fair to presume that Mr Compeyson does not wish him well. Abel's come back! - You told me he'd never come back. - Calm down, Molly. He mustn't find out, ever. Poor, poor, Abel. What did you make me do? It was wicked, wicked! Abel will never find out. I'll shall ensure that. - Did I not swear at the time... - You swore that she'd be safe! You swore she'd have a brand-new life! Jaggers, you must tell me. Who is this "she"? Magwitch and Molly had a child. A girl. A pretty thing. Bu! Molly was a fierce one, wild and passionate like her husband, and not a woman to let injustice go unpunished. Compeyson, of course, was safe in prison. His wife, however, was not safe. Molly found hen. A terrible crime. Cold-blooded and ruthless, assuming, of course, that Molly did it. But to be guilty and to be found guilty are different things. Put the case that a woman accused of murder went to see her legal adviser... And put the case that same legal adviser holds a trust to find a child for an eccentric and rich woman to adopt and bring up. Put the case that the legal adviser said to the mother of the child... Give the child into my hands, I will do my best to get you off. If you are saved, your child is saved. If you are lost, your child is still saved. And the child was your fee? And what of Magwitch? - The father was told... - No! You say his name! Magwitch was told that the child had died. Consumption. Put the case that she is now safe and wealthy, and about to marry one of the richest men in England. And one of the vilest. Estella is not the Spider's reward. Estella is his punishment. And you arranged it. As instructed by my client. Only as instructed. And what did Miss Havisham want with the child? Well, you, uh, must ask her yourself. What did you want with the child? I just wanted a little girl, to love, and to rear, to save from my fate. One nigh! he brought her here... And I called her Estella. Pip, she was so gentle. She was so beautiful. Pip, believe me, when she first came to me, I just meant to save her from misery like my own. But as she grew more beautiful, I gradually did worse. And with my praises and my jewels and my teachings, I... I stole her heart away... And put ice in its place. I stole her heart away... And put ice in its place. Pip, are you very unhappy? Do you hate me very much? I know you must hate me, but if you can ever bear to forgive me... Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. Forgive me. I won't deny there have been too many secrets. But who would the truth serve? If Estella... Were to discover that her father is a convict, her mother a murderess, would she thank you, do you think? Hmm? Sir. A note for you. Most important, the gentleman said. Bastard! Where are you? Show your bitchy face! - Did you destroy my note? - I did. Best not to leave any evidence. They're on to him, Mr Pip. Police. The reward on his head is substantial. Every copper and cutthroat in London is on the hunt for your Antipodean Uncle. It was all your Mr Herbert and I could do to get him out in time. How do we get him away? There's a steamer leaving for Antwerp at midnight. You and your Uncle find a way onto it. Portable property, Mr Pip. Try and lay hold of portable property. All is well, Handel. He's quite safe here. Though he is keen to see you. - Goodness! What happened to your hands? - Where is he? Listen, the steamer departs at midnight. We'll intercept it shortly after. The further from the city we can get, the safer it will be. It's not long now. Thank 'ee, my boy. - I love you. - Herbert... Clara, I will return your fiance safely, I swear. Apologies, Handel. She thinks you have rather a malign influence on me. And she's right. Herbert, are you sure you want to... Handel, I don't think I've ever been more excited in my life! "The rain pattered dismally against the panes, "and my candle was nearly burnt out, "when, by the glimmer of the half-extinguished light, "I saw the dull yellow eye of the creature open... "It breathed." Something wrong, Abel? Not a bit of it. To sit here and have my smoke along with my dear boy... I had a little child once. I didn't tell you afore. Pretty little thing. A girl. Died while I was in prison. But there weren't a day, as I was rotting on that hulk, when I didn't think on her face and what a dear, pretty thing she were. And when I saw you on them marshes, well, you brought her to my mind. Maybe that's why I took to you so strong. I hope I've been a friend 10 you this little time we've had. You speak as if we're parting. In an hour, we'll be safe aboard. We can no more see to the bottom of the next few hours than we can see to the bottom of this river. Which I catches in my hand. And it's run through my fingers and gone. You see? Listen! Can you hear? Get the oars. We'll head down the river and wait. Go, boys. Go! Come on, boys, row! - Stop! Stop that boat! - There they are! Go on, boys! Put your back into it! Row! You have a returned convict there! His name is Abel Magwitch. I apprehend the man, and call upon him to surrender! Keep going! Com peyson. Row! Stop! Stop that boat! Nearly there! Turn! Come on, boys! They're closing on us! No! No! Get off! Handel! Handel! - Hang on! - Magwitch, grab my hand! - Look out, Pip! - Aargh! Pip! - Magwitch! - We have to get over there! No! Magwitch! Up you come. Give me your hand. Give me your hand. Just get in there! Come on. - Abel! - Handel, don't. No. Abel! All is lost. All is gone. You've let the whole thing slip through your fingers. - Will he be tried? - Yes. He will be tried and found guilty, too, and hanged. The best that we can hope for is that he dies before it comes to that. The money, the land, are all forfeit to the crown. You have nothing, Pip. Not a penny. Can we keep that from him? I'd like him to think I'm a gentleman still. I must, amongst you, single out a miserable man who, after many years of living a peaceable and honest life in exile, decided, in a fatal moment, to return to the country where he was expressly proscribed. Whatever the motive for his return, there can only be one punishment. A punishment he shall share with all of you here before me today. By the power vested in me by this court, I sentence you all to death by hanging. May the Lord have mercy on your souls. Are you in much pain today? I don't complain, dear boy. If only you had stayed away... And not seen this face? I... I wish I had been more deserving of your love. Hush. A gentleman. My very own. Magwitch, I must tell you. Your daughter... Whom you loved and lost... She lived. She lived, and found powerful friends. She is living now. She is a lady and very beautiful. And I... I love her. I don't know you. Concerns a debt, sir. 125.15 and 6. - I don't have it. - We didn't think so, sir. So we've come to arrest you. Would you come with us, please, sir? Yes. Yes, of course. - Hello there. - Is it Joe? Which it is, old chap. Forgive me, Joe. Dear old Pip, old chap, you and me was ever friends. Now, you sleep... And when you're well enough, what larks! "Paid in full." "Paid in full." "Paid." I came as quickly as I could. I wanted to tell you... on, Pip. It's my wedding day! Biddy, I can't for the life of me get... Pip. Oh, Pip! - Oh! - Biddy! Oh! Right, this way! Come on! Forward, troops! Come on! Or I'll carry you like a big bird and fly like a bird all the way over there. Come on, Mrs Gargery. One, two, three, four. Oh! Oh, my poor old back! What have you been eating? Pip! Whoo! - Your life savings, Joe! - It's only money, Pip. Nevertheless, I will work. I will pay you back every penny, if it takes me... Pip. That's enough. - Father! Father! - Charles, be quiet. How many times do I need to tell you, this is a place of business, not a nursery! I have a letter. Given by a lady. Oh, a lady. How intriguing! Handel! You've a letter. Drummle died two years ago. He was kicking his horse, and the horse kicked back. I'm sorry to hear that. Pip... I'm sorry for anything that brings you sorrow. Well, rest assured I feel none. My husband and I made each other perfectly miserable, just as intended. I have been bent and broken... But I hope into a better shape. I've been travelling a great deal. I had heard that you were here, and thriving... And I had a desire to see my old friend. My only friend. When we last met, you said that you would always think of me. And I have. - That you would think of the good in me. - Always. You are a part of me, Estella. "You are in the ships", you said, "And the river." I love you, Estella. I'm glad.
