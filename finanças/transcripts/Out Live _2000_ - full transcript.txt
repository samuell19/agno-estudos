Shin, Hyun June Kim, Hee Sun Jung, Jin Young Jang, Dong Jik Original Story: Kim, Hye Rin Producer: Jung, Tae Won Directed by Kim, Young Jun Bichunmoo Mother! My name is Sullie. Sullie. And you? - Jinha. My name is Sullie. Sullie. And you? - Jinha. Here. From today, you can practice with a real sword. My father is finally coming. But what's the use? Mother is so sick... Whatever may happen stay with me always. You said I start with the sword today? Out of the way! Insolence! Leave him. We must press on. - Yes, General. A fine-featured lad. What is your name? I... I'm of lowly birth and have no family name. My name is Jinha, sir. Father, we should go now. We should be at her deathbed. Jinha, bring me some water. We're going to Shao Xing. Mother's body isn't even cold yet. I'll ask the officials to take care of the funeral. I'm not leaving. - You're my daughter. You go with me. I don't want to! Let go of me! Let go! - Sullie! Sullie! - Jinha! Brother! Don't! If he dies, so do I! Jinha! Jinha! I'm sorry. I have to leave. I won't leave you. Listen! Every full-moon day, I'll wait at Yu Hua Pagoda in Shao Xing. You have to remember. Yu Hua Pagoda! Shao Xing. Taruga Manor. Young lord, just as I heard you do carry a joke too far. But isn't it so? I can't find any serviceable women. No beauties like Yi, Su Yon of old... Did it cost too much for you to get beauties like that, General? My lord. What's the matter? Drink up! Ah, do you lack music? Who dares interrupt my music? Quite pretty for a Mongol's servant. What's your name? A proud one, aren't you? Don't you want to change your lot? Quiet! You should have slapped him some more while you were at it! Fool! No one in Shao Xing can survive after provoking a Namgung lord! Why don't you just crush them like the House of Yu in North Ho? Shut up! Why should descendants of the great Mongols kowtowto that kind of Han scoundrel? I said shut up! Do not mention the Namgung lords or the House of Yu ever again! It's been six months already. Let's leave for Shao Xing now. Forget about Sullie! Uncle! Once you perfect the Bichun Secret Arts, there are things that you must do. I will go to Shao Xing with or without you. You almost got yourself killed! Would Sullie even look at you? She may be a concubine's child, but she's the daughter of a rich and powerful Mongol general! Wealth and glory are stretched out before her. Look at yourself! You have nothing! - Stop it! We had a hard time finding you. Give us the Bichun Secrets! You'll have to kill me if you want even a glimpse of it. Uncle! Jinha... Uncle! You must be exhausted. Why did you insist on coming here? There is something I must show you. This was once the greatest manor in North Ho. The great House of Yu. The master swordsman Yu, Jangok was neither a Mongol nor a Han. He was from Koryo(ancient Korea), a Koryo. He was a hostage from Koryo the Crown Prince's bodyguard. His wife Yi, Suyon, a Koryo woman was the greatest beauty in North Ho. The bloody murders were said to be a strike against anti-Yuan forces. But actually they were after the ultimate Secrets held by Yu. Master Yu! - Go, quickly! Master Yu! Most tragic of all was Mistress Yi. After a desperate escape, she had to abandon the last Yu heir. And tragically... Why are you saying this, Uncle? Young Master! I am not your uncle. I'm Master Yu's swordsman, Kwakjung. Once you perfect the Bichun Secret Arts, you must revenge your parents so that they can rest in peace. I only regret that I cannot reveal who the enemy is... Forgive my disloyalty over the years. Uncle! Uncle! Uncle! I heard you come here every full-moon day. If you're going back soon why not join me? I must wait here until sunset. What do you mean? Refuse his proposal of marriage? - He's not my man. I won't let you behave like a child as you did in Shan Mei! Is it the Bichun Secrets you're after? How about we stand-ins fight with each other? Thank you. I hope I wasn't interfering. I am Namgung Junkwang. What is your name, great swordsman? - Jinha. I am Yu, Jinha. Brother Yu, you remind me of someone. Someone no longer of this world. I myself have only seen her portrait. Yi, Suyon of the old House of Yu in North Ho. When I was a boy she was my first love. You don't talk much, Brother Yu. You seem to have traveled a lot. Tell me some stories of the world. Have you ever loved a woman such that it drove you mad? I adored her at first sight. After a lifetime of wandering a light has come to brighten my life. I knew it the moment I saw her. Does she love you, too? I will make her love me. Show this when you visit me and you will be served courteously. Be sure to drop by once your business is finished. I would like to hear more of the world from you. So you will. Excuse me, can you tell me where Taruga Manor is? I think it's on the main street. And the Namgung lord's manor? Those two houses... you must be going to the wedding! A wedding? You haven't heard? It's the talk of the town! Lord Namgung's only son is marrying the daughter of General Taruga's concubine. What a great distinction for a concubine's daughter! Where do you think you're going? Have you forgotten that young Lord Namgung is coming today? That is none of my concern. - You will see to him courteously! This was not my decision. Is accepting me so difficult? My lord, you and I are worlds apart. Please do not mock me. I never thought to beg for love in such a manner. Please accept my proposal. Are you sure this Yu, Jinha is of the North Ho House of Yu? - Yes! I should have recognized him in Shan Mei. But I'll end his life yet. He defeated the men I sent. He used the Bichun Secrets. - Shut up! Do you think he knows about the Yu Manor incident? Don't worry. If we dispose of him and gain the Bichun Secrets we will rule supreme. Isn't that so, my dear in-law? So this was the Yu Hua Pagoda promise? Defeat me. Jinha Take good care of her. Search everywhere! - Yes, sir! Young lord, this is not a place for you to be. My betrothed is missing! Who is the scoundrel? I've told you several times you've misunderstood. Tell me who the scoundrel is! The son of the ruined North Ho Yu's. His name is Jinha. He has taken my daughter as vengeance, no doubt. You mean the scoundrel is Yu, Jinha? Jinha! Father will kill you! Run! - My lady! Let go of me! You're not different from them! You're the one who should atone for your crime, Father! Wasn't it enough to destroy the House of Yu in North Ho? Now you want to kill Jinha, too? - Quiet! Our fates are ill-crossed. The General seems to want the Bichun Secrets. But not I. I can't endure another man in her heart. Defeat me. Then you can live. If you are at a disadvantage jump to the side. We'll shoot arrows. I don't want to fight you. Sullie doesn't love you. I will marry him. Are you going to Ping River? What did you say? I said, are you going to Ping River? Yes. It'll take a while this time I'm worried about you. I don't know how Shao Xing got so infested with assassins. The other day, an imperial envoy was killed in the street. Mongolians are afraid to go out at night. Don't worry about me. Just have a good trip. I'll come back as soon as possible. Don't change the subject Lord Namgung! Do you think the Namgungs who were favored by the Emperor will be left unscathed? I haven't lived to this age without learning that much. But I cannot invest in war funds again. There is nothing left for Mongol glory but to withdraw from history's foreground and go back to the prairie. Merchants don't trust any rulers. We only believe in the ruling principles of life. Since you're here why don't you see your daughter? Still no news from Lai? None after a sighting at the Tai Yang Lake battle. I'm leaving. Say goodbye to Lord Namgung for me. You must be stronger than ever now and live undaunted! Forget about the other half of your blood... We won't see each other again... You've grown old, General. Do it! Let's escape, Mother. Let's escape somehow, and go to Ping River where Father is. I'm going to revenge myself on that killer, whatever it takes. We've secured all of Namgung's estate. And, sir, this... We found it in the storage room. We saw the title Yi, Suyon of the House of Yu. It seems to be your mother's portrait, sir. You're dismissed. Mother! Mother! Go, quickly! Go, right now! I said go! Are you so undisciplined that you fumble over a trifle? You're the one who let the Mongol girl stay in her room! I should be entitled to that much. And the child? The boys are after him so don't worry about the brat. Brother, he's awake! Where am I? Who are you? The wound isn't deep. Jinha... what about Sung? I beg you. Let him live! He is everything to me, the only reason I kept living... - Enough! Stop it! Jinha, please... He's our son, yours and mine! Long years as a powerful man's wife has made you this cunning, hasn't it? The Ping River You're sure this Jahalang is son of the North Ho House of Yu? Yes, sir. Tai Yang Lake Perhaps I should pay Shao Xing a visit. Splendid work, everyone! A toast! To victory! Got that Mongol bitch on your mind, Jahalang? If not, mind if I take her to my bedroom tonight? You're requested at a meeting in Lady Jin's room. What kind of meeting is this? Take a seat. Since neither of us like being in crowds, Let us celebrate on our own. If this is what you called me for I'm leaving now. There's something I want to know. Jahalang, I know you well. Now that you've fulfilled your aim, the coming fight will have no meaning for you. Now what will you fight for? The 'trophy' in the lady's chambers? Or perhaps you could fight for me? Not for you. You shouldn't be outside yet. You play very well. I'm not that good. Uncle plays much better... You mean the man who saved me? Alisu! Tell me who he is! How can I see him? He sometimes comes to the cave behind the house. He's there now... a Thank you for taking care of him. - You have quite a fate, Jinha. A father who can't reveal his face or voice to his own son. Let me speak to him! This must be fate, too. My name is Namgung Sung. I am grateful to you for saving my life, but I dare ask another favor of you. Take me as your apprentice, Master! I must take revenge on a man called Jahalang. Get out. Sullie... Get out. I'm not the one you used to know. What do you want me to do? Everything ended the day you came to me as a killer. Sung is alive. Once we take the Nan Xi River, we'll never have to see another Mongol in this land. Jahalang, once again we trust in your skill. Call in Yeo Jin. Once again, I put my faith in you for this mission. Remember each of your duties. Welcome, Marshal Heo. Greetings. I came to bring you news. What is it? Is it true you are interested in the Mongol girl? If so, it's such a tragedy. She's dead. A great fire swept through her room. Everything is burned. You can't even distinguish the bones. I can't believe you came. Did you do this? - I wanted you so much! Come away with me. I'll abandon everything. You... All I need is you. You're the first to remain standing after being poisoned with Mihon. Seize him! What did you say? He crept in at night to kill Jo, Baek Seung, but was caught and executed. The Mongols must have paid him off. That's ridiculous. - Do you continue to side with him? Let's be frank. I'll talk to the governor. Now that the Ten Swordsmen have no marshal, we'll need a new one... What do you think? Not bad. You're smart. You must follow the current to make your way in life! I just lost my chief. How can I trust a scoundrel like Jo, Baek Seung? Do as you please. No one on earth can save you now! If you wish to stay alive, tell me where you keep the Bichun Secrets! So you were after the Secrets? Why else would I take in a Koryo like you? It's not in his room. Then go after his Koryo friend! If Jahalang doesn't have it then he probably does. You know the place, don't you? - Yes, sir! Sajune, go with them! Make sure it's done properly. That's all the information you have? He's alive but you don't know where he is? It's difficult, since it's in Qing Chen Bang. I'll look into it again. No, I'll go myself. What's going on? Run, quick! - Sir! Remember, Sung! You're of Koryo blood! You must guard the master's Bichun Secrets! Alisu! Brother! You're awake. Good thing I came when I did, but you're something else. Alone against three men! Brother... You should leave now, sir. - No need to stay for long in Shao Xing. Do you think it's true that Jo has killed Jahalang? People have coveted the Secrets for a long time. I'm sorry, Lai. I must leave to finish some task. Please take care of yourself. This is for Yu, Jinha! It's remarkable that he's still alive. The poison has spread throughout his body. That's enough, you may go. - My lady, it's too late to cure him. You could get infected yourself. That is none of your concern. I wasn't able to cure you completely. If you use your sword before regaining your strength, the effects of the poison will recur. Please... wait until you recover. They were hiding in a cave. Brother! Kill them! Uncle! Uncle... What did you call him? Uncle? That's a lie! That's Jahalang! Not my Master! My master isn't a murderer! - Please stop it! You shouldn't treat him that way! He... He's your father! The area is in chaos. We must do something, quickly. You've found the Mongols? - Yes, sir. Get the girl first, in the name of revenge. And Jahalang? Once we have the girl, he's as good as ours. If all goes well, you will be our next governor, my lord. Are you awake? Lady Sullie has killed Jo, Baek Seung. She's staying in the house behind Yu Hua Pagoda. You should rest. Changlyong... Thank you. Look closely, Namgung Sung! This is your master's true identity. What are you waiting for? Tell me. Did you do it to punish my mother? Your mother did nothing wrong. I didn't understand the world then. Listen to me well. You are Namgung Sung! Do you understand? Follow me. You shouldn't have come. What do you mean? I am your husband and you are my wife! We've lived together for 10 years! You don't understand... Why I made up my mind to live. Sung is not your son. I wanted to mix his bloodline with the House of Namgung. Because I hated my father... and I hated you. I knew that. I thought that I deserved it. I'll never forget his eyes when I pushed him toward the cliff, out of selfish desire to have you for my own. I never thought I'd be able to speak of it... I'm not sure about you, but I was happy. Come back as my wife, Sullie... I'd rather you killed me. Then we'd both be free of Jinha. I wonder about the bond between you two. If there's such a thing as fate, that must be it. I wanted to say thank you. Sung! It's been a long time, Jinha. Let's not stand on ceremony, shall we? If I die, take care of Sullie. - Sullie is your wife! Lift up your sword. Lift your sword and attack me, Jinha! Now we can remain friends. Welcome. Jahalang's end is near, my lord! You should see them, sir. - No need. I've ordered the men to stand by. It's a personal matter. We'll part ways here. I can't do that. - That's an order, Changlyong! Yes, sir. Take care. Where is Jinha now? He left. - Where did he go? He's looking for a place to die. Go back! Go back! Go back! What about Sung? Who'll take care of him? I'm sorry. I'm leaving you again... Sullie... Sung... Take care of Sung... My name is Sullie. Sullie. And you? Jinha.
