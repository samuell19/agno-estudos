Hello? Yes, thank you for accepting the call. Uh, can I speak to Greg Bernard, please? Mr. Reid, Mr. Bernard isn't available. All right, can you put me through to his cellphone? It's urgent that I speak to him. There was a situation in general population. It wasn't my fault, but they sent me to solitary confinement for it as punishment. I apologize. I can let Mr. Bernard know. No, ma'am, just don't apologize. Just listen to me, okay? They... they've confiscated all my belongings. I don't have anything, not a pencil, not a paper. So unless Greg can help me retrieve my things, I won't be able to mail out my statement for petition to appeal. It was supposed to go out today for my hearing next week. Do you understand? I'm being informed that your hearing was postponed. Okay, okay. This is... excellent. Thank you. When is it rescheduled for? How long do I have to get my statement in to Greg? I'm sorry, but your hearing has been postponed indefinitely. You said you were just informed. By who, one of the other partners? Can I speak to one of them, please? Put them on the phone. They... they're gonna send me back to my cell. Can you put one of them on the phone, please? That's just not possible. I don't think you understand me. They've given me a life sentence and I'm innocent. This is not a joke. Mr. Reid, I'm sorry. Why do you keep apologizing to me? Just put one of them on the phone. You should have received notice in the mail. You're being sued in civil court. Your assets have been frozen. And since you're technically unable to pay, the firm has decided not to move forward with your case. Greg would not do that to me. We have been friends since middle school. I'm so sorry. We sent you the documents so you can refile your appeal with a public defender. Or you can represent yourself. I'm really very sorry. Up against the wall. Let's walk. It's just a random check. For what? What's this? You know, there is nothing that you can think of that I haven't thought first. Oh, what's wrong? I thought all dogs like the smell of their own rectum. That's not mine. According to who? It's according to whom. Oh, it's according to whom. Really? Yeah. If you were smart as you think you are, you wouldn't be here, would you, Dr. Reid? I read your file. I got a jacket on... all the inmates here in the SHU. I was already searched. Oh, not by me. You see, if I had to strip searched you and this turned up stashed in your cavity, I would have shoved my boot so far up your ass, this razor would have come out of your mouth. Get up. First offense is 90 days. Anything like this happens again, I'm gonna add on a whole year. Hey, you. You like to hurt women? Yeah, you know that's why Sacks is fucking with you, right? Hey, friend, with all due respect, it's been a long day. I really don't feel like talking right now, so if you don't mind. Excuse me, guard. When do I get my belongings? My legal papers. It's... it's urgent. I need them today. This ain't the Four Seasons, motherfucker. Keep off the door! Goddammit, Zeke. Pull the mattress off the window. Keep this up and you will suffer the consequences. There's things going on in this prison... This ain't right. The fucking bitches... Don't! Zeke! They're never gonna let me out of here! - We're coming in. - Three seconds. No, you come in here... Three. Two. One. Open the cell door. Don't! Zeke, Zeke! Get that bitch away from me! Let go! You're breaking my fucking arm! You're breaking my arm! Fuck you! Show the warden some respect. Let go! Ow! You're fucking hurting me! Excuse me, guard. My tray, I don't think I had a full portion. Can I have a little bit more? Please? Oh, don't you look nice. Sorry I'm late. It's okay. Understood. Careful. Thank you. Oh, look. It's our guardian angel. It's what we call pareidolia. Our brains are wired to perceive faces in things. It's actually a form of pattern recognition. Can't I just appreciate the view? You don't think that that's... Interesting? Mm-mm. So, you didn't bring any clothes to work in? I thought the whole point of buying this boat was so that we can relax. We haven't even started. Baby, it's such a beautiful day. Why can't we just enjoy it? Why don't we take the boat out for a lap around the bay, and then we'll work, I promise. We need this. We need what? To fix this. There's a passage I'd like to share with you, one that occurs to me in times like this. Let every man be subject to the governing authorities for there is no authority except from God. And those authorities that do exist, have been instituted by God. Yeah. I don't like the segregated housing unit. It changes people. Every time an inmate has to be extracted, they call me down and I see it firsthand. That man in the cell next to you, Zeke, he flooded out his cell because he was desperate, desperate for human contact. I have a prison to run. I have a responsibility to my staff and to the other inmates to segregate the troublemakers. Oh, man. That's not mine. You know that. It was in your mattress. Maybe... I can help you help yourself. If, for instance, you were willing to enroll in a behavior modification program, I can commute your stay in the segregated housing unit. You would be able to reenter the general population immediately. What does one have to do to get into this program? Simple. Just obey the rules, and sign a confession. The road to rehabilitation starts with acceptance. No. I heard about you, Harlow. Any chance you can move me to a new cell? You two deserve each other. Hey, black man. Do you believe in God? Hey, you, Harlow. I know you hear me, boy. I'm trying to save your life. How's that? If you got something to say, say it. Otherwise, just leave me alone. Go to your cell door and look out in the hallway. Do you see them lights, the long ones up there on the ceiling? That's where they live. They feed on the energy and travel through the vents. That's how they get into the cells. Do you believe in ghosts? I'm afraid whatever it is you think you're seeing, that's just your mind's way of... of keeping you company. They ain't trying to keep me company. They're trying to kill me! Who's trying to kill you? In here, we all got victims. Some of those victims, the ones who ain't with us no more, they're looking for revenge. It sounds like you're having a crisis of conscience. Shut up. You sound like a shrink. A psychiatrist, yes. Don't you try and talk to me, motherfucker! Hey, I was not passing judgment. All right, you're the one that said you wanted to talk. Why don't you tell me something then? Like... how'd you kill your wife? I'm innocent! I'm innocent. So we're downstairs and I hear this groaning. So I walk down the hall and I see this big Mexican motherfucker. He's holding his cock in one hand and squeezing his wrist with the other, trying to cut the circulation off. You know, apparently, it feels like someone else is jerking you fuckin' off. I think I'll have to try that. The sooner we resurface this deck, the sooner that Amber sets sail. What? So, you do still love me? Free at last. Free at last. Sacks! Uh, Sacks, Sacks, excuse me, please. I'm so sorry, but can I just have, um... can I have a sharpened pencil, please, something that works? You want a pencil, huh. Yeah, if it's not too much trouble, that'd be nice. Thank you. How does it feel to want? If you keep letting them treat you like a bitch, I'm gonna have to take care of myself. Yeah, I'm talking to you. All right, all right. Judge McCabe, I am an innocent man serving a life sentence in a federal penitentiary. I respectfully request an opportunity to appeal my conviction. Look at that! It gives me great pleasure to inform you that I have discovered evidence within my case file that was never presented at my original trial. Fucking lawyers. Due to the negligence of my attorney, I've decided to act as my own counsel and will be filing my petition to appeal personally. They're gonna get the truth, Zeke. Soon enough. Go thank your friend, Harlow. I want you so bad right here. No. Right now. I'm sweating. Right now, I don't care that you're sweating. Besides, people are gonna see. I don't care who sees. No, you can wait. This is what you get for putting me to work. Suit yourself. You know what? If you keep that up, you might get what you're looking for. We got a pervert in the house! Five inmates up and offed themselves in the last 24 months. No one even bats an eye. She ain't gonna stop. All she has to do is keep us here. The SHU does all the work for her. You got a message. I'll check it later. You sure? Yeah, whoever it is can wait. Who was it? My mother. I told her not to call me this weekend. What does she want? Mm. I'll call her later. You sure? You can just, you can call her now if you want. What did she want? - What did she text you? - Nothing. Nothing. Show me the text. I want you to show me the message right now. How does it feel to want? No. It can't be. I've seen your face. What? You had a face like an angel's. What happened to your beautiful face? Who the hell are you talking to, Zeke? Oh, Goddammit! Stop! Stop looking at me! Get away from me! Help! Call the warden. What? Goddammit, Zeke, what have you done? What is happening? Ezekiel! Zeke! What happened, man? Hello? Judge McCabe, please accept my apology for the time it's taken to draft my personal statement and file for an appeal. It's become increasingly difficult to obtain a suitable writing utensil while serving time in the SHU. Hey, Ezekiel! Sacks! Can I just get just like a little bit more food? I demand a new pencil. How long you been up, Harlow? You can't stop me from filing my appeal. I want my pencil. You don't look so good. Maybe you oughta just... lie down. Go to sleep. I want a pencil. Now. Hmm. Maybe tomorrow. Rule number one, don't let nobody, nobody disrespect you up in here. They don't know what you're capable of, but I do. My nigga! I think today is my birthday. Hey, yo, Zeke. Ezekiel! Is this your doing, Zeke? Harlow. Use the ink that's flowing in your veins. Yo, Zeke, is that you? Man, man. You gonna leave me over here alone like this, man? Not bad, not bad. Judge McCabe, I intend to prove that unfair racial profiling led to my arrest, and the selection of a jury with preconceived notions about my character. Requestioning key witnesses will prove this theory. You should also know there's a corrections officer here in the SHU determined to silence me by any means necessary. I just wanted to talk to my mom. I don't think there's anything wrong with that. It's not gonna work like this. You are a control freak. You still don't get that you brought this on yourself. Things were like this before the affair. Everything I say to you, you end up using it against me. You're constantly looking over my shoulder and second-guessing everything I do. What do you want? I don't want anything. You don't want anything? Then fuck off then! Why did you bring me here? Do you have any idea what kind of man they'll think I am? I don't wanna be analyzed by you. I just needed to talk. There's nothing wrong with me talking to my own mother. You don't think that she's gonna tell him? What do you care what my father... Because! He gave me the money to start my fucking practice, Amber! So this is about money. This is about me not having to defend my choice not to leave you! I'm gonna make this easy for you. Hey. To the window! When we call you to the window, you get up and move. Get dressed. Mr. Reid. I have good news for you. Your time in the segregated housing unit is up. I trust you're ready to try again back in the general population. God, yes. Thank you. Thank God indeed. You'll have to spend a few weeks in the step down unit. Good luck. Prepare the prisoner's personal items. Yes, sir. Officer Sacks. Thank you. Thank you. Warden. What is it, Mr. Reid? What happened to Zeke? Zeke. If I were you, I wouldn't concern myself with him. Come on. Face the bars, prisoner. You know, if... if things were different, I might actually have been able to help you. Huh/ Too bad there's not a couch in here, huh, Harlow? Go on. I hope whoever cut you got what they deserved. Two years. Two years in the SHU plus the time he'd already served. And every night, I go home, look in the mirror, and think to myself if today that sorry excuse for a human being just happened to, you know, stop breathing, I'd be doing the world a huge favor. And every day, I decided I was better than that, so I did nothing. You did the right thing. Piece of shit. Eventually got out on parole. Within a few months, he was back to his lowlife ways, driving around with a truck full of drugs. Cops pursued him for almost 26 miles. Finally, he lost control. He plowed into a 13-year-old girl waiting for a school bus. That's when I knew, people like him... ...people like you... don't deserve second chances. You will be back in the SHU, Harlow. And you'll do the dirty work for me, just like... the guy... who gave me this. I can't wait to see you swinging from your bed sheet. For me, that's justice enough. [thudding Hey! On your knees, convict, now! Don't move! - What did she text you? - Nothing. Nothing. Show me the text. I want you to show me the message right now. I needed to talk. I needed to talk to my mom and there's nothing wrong with that. And every time I try to talk to you, you end up using everything against me. You're looking over my shoulder and you're second-guessing everything I do. And it's not gonna work like this. No, you're right, it's not gonna work this way 'cause you still don't get... that you brought this on yourself. Welcome back, Harlow. Looks like Officer Sacks gave you more than just a pencil. Harlow, you hungry? Help! Help! You just earned yourself another 90 days, prisoner. No! No! - Get up. - No! - No! - Go get yourself cleaned up. - We should call psych. - No, no, no. Pull back, prisoner! You go ahead and get cleaned up. I got this. I'll take care of the trays. Fine. I'll be right back. If you're gonna act like an animal, I'm gonna treat you like an animal. Please. Eat up, Harlow. I would rather starve. I can wait if you can. I tried to tell you, man. Fuck Sacks. Trust in God. I can't wait to see you swinging from your bed sheet. Shank that bitch in the neck. You had a face like an angel. What happened to your beautiful face? Do you love me? You know. You know, Harlow. You know what you did. Sign a confession. Thank you. Yes. Just the way I like it. Bon appetit. You're trying to bait me into being the kind of man that you think that you deserve. When I spoke to my mother, it was in a moment of weakness. You don't get to call it a moment of weakness when you can't get through an entire day without having a breakdown. Have you been taking the pills that I gave you? There's nothing wrong with me. You don't like the way that you feel without them. The issue will not resolve itself, Amber. The issue is that I don't like the way you treat me. Stop! Respect me. I'm sorry. I don't understand. What is it you want? To get outta here. Zeke. Zeke, yeah, Zeke. What you want, Harlow? If we was anywhere else but here, you wouldn't even give me the time of day. You're just one of them fair-weathered friends, ain't you, Harlow? No, I'm not. You got this, motherfucker. Come on, Harlow. Man the fuck up! We gonna be in here for the rest of our lives. Better get used to this. You part of the statistic now. One in three, that's your ass. Plus my ass. That's two, 2.3 million motherfuckers in jail, behind bars! You're one of 'em. You a slave. They took away the chains, put them shits back on 'cause you fucked up! No. This is your fault. It was an accident and you know that. You, you bad. You know. No. You know. You know. Harlow, you guilty as hell. You might as well cop to it. Zeke? Zeke? Talk to me, Zeke. You're all that I have. What? I didn't do it. I didn't do it. I didn't do it. No, I didn't... What's happening to me? Did I fucking do it? I didn't do it. I didn't do it. What? Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I didn't do it. I... no. What? What? Respect... - me. - Stop it. Are you okay? Are you okay? I did it. I did it. I killed my wife. I wanna do the program. You killed your wife and now you wanna make a deal? Yeah. Yes. Yes. Yes. Thank you, yes. Please. Get me outta here. Not on my watch. Get the fuck away from me. Wait, wait, wait, no, no. Don't touch me. No! No, no, no. Warden! I'm ready to do the program! Come get me! I'm ready! Come get me! I'm ready to do the program! I'm ready to accept responsibility for my actions! Come on! Come on and get me! Come get me! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Let me out! Please. Come on! Warden! Yes! Come get me! Come on! I wanna see the warden! Help! I need help! Get me out of here! I'm done! I'm done! Lord Jesus Christ, please have mercy on us. Stop, stop. Stop it. I'll never let you go. Stand up, prisoner. Please. I'll sign whatever you want, please. Just get me Perez. Get him cleaned up. Go! Right away, sir. We need to fix this. Why did you bring me here? You're making the right decision. We'll be able to get you into a program within a couple of weeks. Get away from me, please. Mr. Reid. Stop wasting everyone's time. Uncuff the prisoner. Respect... - me. - Stop it. If you are not going to sign the document, you need to go back to your cell. I'm walking away. Mr. Reid? No! Take the prisoner back to the SHU. Stop this at once! Let her go. Drop the weapon. Remove the pen from Officer Sacks's throat. She's trying to make me kill myself. No idea how crazy you sound. Officer Sacks, not another word! She's torturing me. She's torturing Zeke. I'm not the only one. Harlow, Zeke is dead. Just listen to me, okay? Just watch the security tapes! She's trying to turn my mind against me! I'm not going back there with her. I will look into this. - Trust God. - If you're a man of God, then check the damn security tapes. I'm begging you. You have my word. Just let go. I can't. Let go. Let go, Harlow. Let go. Let go. Sacks! Stand down! Get out. I'll take the prisoner back to his cell, sir. Last chance. I might be guilty of a lot of things, but I know I am not guilty of killing my wife. While serving hard time for a crime that never was, my memories of the past have been stolen from me, replaced with violent delusions, delusions that better serve a new version of me, the version of me writing this letter, spawned by the SHU. Without human contact, my mind calls upon corrupted memories to convince itself the man I once was never existed and the animal I fight every day not to become is who I am. I will never stop fighting to remain the man I truly am, a loving husband, an esteemed doctor, a free man. Judge McCabe, I beg the court to allow me the opportunity to appeal my conviction, present a new case, and prove my innocence once and for all. I'll mail the letter personally. Dr. Reid. What's wrong, Harlow? You don't wanna talk to me no more? Shh. Shh. Shh. Look at you. I'm so proud of you, man. Only way you're going to survive this is with me. You got a long road ahead of you. Are you ready for court? Psst. Guess who. Dr. Reid.
