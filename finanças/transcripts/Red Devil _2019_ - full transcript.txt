- Do you believe that you can ever quit Red Devil? - You can't quit this shit, it's impossible. And even if you could, why the fuck would you even want to? - So, you don't want to quit? What about for the sake of your two children? - Once you've tasted the devil's cum, everything else is dull and numb. - Relax, Theo, it's all just an urban legend. - You know who we are, and you know who we want. - The Red Devil and the money, you sons of bitches. - Quick as you can. - He's got it. - Danny, Danny, can you swing around? What? No, no, no, no, Danny, Danny, no! - Don't you get it, darling? There's no more Red. It's gone, as quickly as it came. And quite frankly, I'm glad it's gone. It's the devil's potion. - You're making me so fucking wet right now. - They hit us last week, cleaned us out. And they killed little Franko. - Fucking hell, man, who? - You try anything funny, and I assure you, I will kill you both. - What do you mean, who? Ella and fucking Oscar. - Ella and Oscar are urban legends. They're created by the media to strike fear into the underworld and get the fucking Red off the street. - Darling, fuck me. - I'll tell you one thing now, right? There is no such thing as a married couple running around killing fucking drug dealers. Fucking ridiculous! - These motherfuckers, baby, kill them good. - Oh, baby, if you insist. Yeah! - No, no! - Theo? Theo! - How you doing today? Good to see ya. You're looking good. Looking good. - Excuse me, sir, can you spare some change? - I'm so sorry, man. Just, I have my own habits to support, you know? Next time, eh? God bless you. - Dear God, it's just us, Oscar, Ella, and bump. Hope all's well on your end. I can feel the task you've given us is close to being complete, and I want to thank you for believing that we were worthy enough for such a task. Please forgive Ella for doubting the vision, and for doubting her husband. And please look out for my brother William, wherever he may be, and rid him of this evil addiction. I've done a lot for you. I've taken a lot of lives, and I've eradicated Red Devil from Covet County. Some might say you owe me that much. Anyway, must dash, have your work to do. All the best, amen. - Amen. - Baby, let's go kill some sinners. - I fuck love you, baby. - I fucking love you, angel. - Please sir, please, I'd do anything just crumb of that Red. I just need crumb of Red. Please, sir, please! Fuck, you can take it all, look. Yeah, everything I've got, man, please, just one pull! - No, fuck off. - Please, I just need one hit, man, I beg you! - No, there's a drought on. - Give me the fucking Red, man. Give it to me, give it to me, or you're a fucking dead man. I'll fucking blow you away! - Take it! - Brother, brother. Gimme a pull, gimme a pull. - You, get the fuck out! Get away from me! - Just give me a dab. - Get the fuck away! - Give me dab. Please give me a dab, please give me a dab! Will you give me a fucking a dab? I only want a dab! - There he is. The man, the myth, the legend, Gabriel. My friend. - Who's tall, thick, faithful, and fearless? You guessed it, me. I see you put my gift to good use. - I could never shoot anyone. But I don't half feel dangerous when I smoke bud out of the barrel. I'm like John Wayne or Jesse James. - Please tell me you keep the piece loaded, at least. - Uh... - Oh, Hugo, I've told you before, you can never be too careful in your line of work. That's why I bought you the gun. Covet County is a dangerous place. But worry not, my friend, the Beast will keep you safe. The Beast will keep us all safe. - You have got to try this. Now, it's a... It's a mashup of Green Dream, Ice Cream Haze, and Triple Dipper, and I call it Triple Cream Dream. - This is a thing of beauty. It's like the sun rising on a cold autumn morning in the Amazon. - That's what I tell 'em. - You, my friend, will become a true master in the art of botany. This is like the yin to the yang, the Michelangelo of marijuana. - All right, there old man. - Morning, Riley, you wanna be plugged in? - Not today, man. - What, you is a fucking wanker then, aren't you? - Hey, listen, dude, I know you told me not to ask you, man... - If I told you not to ask me something, don't ask me. - I just need to see if you can get hold of any Red, man. - Get the fuck out of me pub. - Ah, sorry, man. Now, man, now! - It's not overkill. Calm down, man. You know I'm no flab, man. - If you're even thinking about asking me about that Red shit, I'll tell you something now. I going thumping, and I am blood that mouth. - I don't touch that shit, man. - Well, all right then, what would you like? Pure euphoria, the fuck of your life, killing spree, secret spying? I even got a special on reverse gang bang. - Uh, man, um... - Come on, son, make up your mind. - Uh... I've been told to... - You decide what you want yet, young man? Or you prefer the colour for any marksman's opinion? - Man, I don't want any trouble. - This is all I fucking need. 100 VR lounge in all Covet County, and this cunt want to set up his residency in one of my lounge? Didn't I tell you not to come back here again? If I see you come back to this Velvet Lounge again, I gonna hurt you. This is a place of escape. You're putting people off their fun. What is it you want? You want the kiddies' stuff, or something? - Of course not. - 'Cause I don't care how much you fucking weirdos are willing to pay, I will have nothing to do with it. - Let me tell you something. I'm not a fucking pedo. - Listen, man, you've been umming and ahing ever since you got in here. What exactly is it you want? - I'm looking for Ella and Oscar. I've been told to meet them here. - No one of that name have anything to do with this lounge. Unless you want to be plugged in, you can leave. You're giving me a headache. - You know what, don't worry about it man, cheers. - Who the fuck told you you can come here? - A fucking priest. He told me to come here at two o'clock. - His name? - Who? - The priest, his name. - It's Barry, but don't worry about it. - Your name, please? - Alfie. - Come with me then, please, Alfie. - Give me the fucking pipe! - Charlie, is that you? - Just gimme the fucking Red, or I'll cave your fucking head in. - Charlie, it's Riley, it's your cousin. - I don't give a fuck who you are. Just gimme the fucking Red now. Please, Riley! Just gimme a fucking hit on the pipe! I'm your cousin! - Hello, Alfie. Excuse the mess. Please, come in. Take a seat. - Thank you. - So, I understand our friend Barry has been speaking with you about a situation we might be able to help you with. - So, it's true. It's actually you two. Ella and Oscar, wow. - Charming to meet you. - You do realise, you've caused the biggest drug drought in Covet County since, I don't know, since ever. I promise you, I thought it was an urban legend, until I met Barry, and even then, I had my doubts. - So, who is the target? - Okay, just the business. He's a dealer. - Red Devil? - Yeah, he got his fingers in lots of pies. - Did Barry not tell you we would only be interested if he's a supplier of Red? - So, that what this is with you guys? A vigilante crusade on Red Devil? - You could say that. - Okay, with all due respect, Mr. Oscar, there are hardly any Red dealers left. They have either been dropped, killed, vanished off the scene in terror. You might be able to score a little bit in Peccancy Street, but it's mostly chilli powder. Every dealer in the entire county is afraid of being killed or robbed by you two. - Except this character, it seems. So, you have our attention. Tell us everything you know. - My little babies, huh? Mary! How are ya? - Hi, Hugo, how's everything? - Good, good, come in. Yes, good to see you. - I was just after an eighth, so I though I'd give you a knock. - Well, I'm glad you did. - You got company? - Oh, it's just my good friend Gabriel. He's tall, he's fit, he's fearless, and he's faithful. - I can come back another time if you... - No, don't be silly, no, you'll like him. He's like family. - Where, where is he, then? - Gabriel! Probably gone for a shit. - Oh. - Either that, or he's heard a woman's voice, and he's probably sneaked off to leave us alone. - Ah. - He's always going on about me meeting someone. Not that I'm interested in you. - Oh, right. - No, I don't mean that. I ain't got time for a girlfriend. Yeah, um, I'm really busy right now. - Yeah, I can see that. - It's called Triple Cream Dream. It's beautiful. - It looks it. - You can stay if you want. - No, I better go. - Well, another time, maybe. - Yeah, maybe. - How, how much do I owe ya? - Oh, please, no charge. - Sweet! - It's just, just maybe, you know, come round, have cup of coffee, listen to some Purple Rabbits. - Purple Rabbits? That's awful, depressing music. - Right, you better go. I've gotta feed the kids. - You have children? - No, me plants. - Oh, right. - You should really give 'em a chance, you know. - Sorry? - Purple Rabbits. They influenced a whole generation. They're the main reason I moved to Covet County in the first place, after hearing one of their songs. - Which one? - "Covet County". ♪ Covet County ♪ - All right. ♪ Roll a fatty ♪ - Good to see you, Hugo. ♪ Chiff some charlie ♪ - Got anything on ya? - No, I haven't got anything. - Wait, I've got money. - But I haven't got... - I've got money on me. - I haven't got anything! - Babe, have you got any Red on you? - Hey baby, lemme give you the best blowjob you've ever had. - I don't want a blowjob, right, I want some fucking Red. - Hey, where you going, big boy? Wanna have some fun? - Can you sort me any Red? I'm gonna sort you out if you can. - Oh, you don't need any Red. I'm gonna suck you until you're dry. - Maybe another time, darling, all right? - What you mean, another time? - I'll even swallow. - Hi, Steve! - Oy, leave the old bloke alone, man! - Won't you go fuck you, bitch. - Watch your mouth, little boy. Leave the tramp alone. - Sorry, Steve. - Get the fuck out of here. Makes my heart bleed when I see the state of the youth today. Don't let adolescents get in the way of your little private party tonight. What are you after? I've got coke, brown, speed, weed, girls, boys. What you need, cuz? - I need some Red, man. - There's a drought, it's gonna cost ya. - Well, is it good? - Straight from the source this morning. It's beautiful, but it's expensive. I'm paying well over the odds for it at the moment, so the circle of life being the circle of life, it means if I pay more, my customers pay more, i.e. you pay more. - What's expensive, man? - Where you going, big boy? I see you looking at me. What do you need? - I don't want anything, all right? - Oh, come on, come with me, white sugar. I'll stick a big black dildo so far up your arse, you won't walk right for a month. Is that what you're into, baby boy? Did mamma guess your desire right? - What? No! Just fuck off, you dirty fucking whore! - What the fuck? Who the fuck do you think you're talking to? Don't think 'cause I'm a woman out here of these streets that I won't fight you, you know. What, so this man thinks he's brave, yeah? - I say you leave it, yeah? Can't you see we're conducting business here? I'm sure once we've conducted our little business he'll consider a nice relaxing blowjob in front of a nice warm log fire, listening to the beautiful sounds of Nina Simone, whilst he sips on a glass of brandy and enjoys his contemptible buzz supplied by yours truly. But until then, if you don't mind, princess. - Watch yourself, fucking fool. - How much is it, man? - How much do you want? - Well, it depends on the price, man. - It's addictive this shit, innit? - Fly me, bruv. - Red Devil changed the game, boy. They say one hit on that shit and you're hooked for life. Well, was that how it was for you, eh? One hit and you're hooked for life, yeah? - Some things help heal the broken-up, man. - I've never tried it myself, though I have to admit, I have been tempted a couple of times. It has a way of tempting a person, don't it? See, I'm one of them rare people who haven't even smoked a joint. But there's something about that Red stuff, innit? Just really tempts you, don't it? They say it takes away a guilty conscience. Was that how it was for you? - Dude, how much is it, man? - 220 a gramme, but it's lovely. - Can you deal a do for a, do a deal for a quarter, man? - Seven grammes? You got the money on you, yeah? - I'm up for the seven, man. - I'll do you up for 1,250. - Okay, good, done, I've got the moneys. - You got the money on you? - Yeah, I got the cash, bro. - Good buy, come on. - Hey, Dreamer, where you going, man? - Not now, right, I've gotta handle some business. We'll talk in a minute. Come on, this way. I keep it at a mate's house. You can't be too careful nowadays, what with all these Ella and Oscar type characters running around killing folk. - It's just urban legends. But I'll tell you what ain't urban legend. If this is a fucking setup, I'm gonna end your life, brother. Just gimme the Red, I'll give you the cash. - Put the fucking gun away, all right, this ain't a setup. You've made your point, all right? Your point has well and truly been made. I make love, not war. Now, come on. This way. Give me the fucking money now, little prick, huh? Now, before I blown your fucking head off! - But sir, is there any Red Devil? - I don't deal with that Devil shit. Don't come back round, do you hear me? No one calls my wife a whore, you little prick! Fucking waste, man! Next time I'll put one between your eyes, you little cunt! - Can we go, Oscar? - Yes, of course, darling, but, try to be nice to her. This might be the last time we see her. She's just old. Please be patient. - I don't like her. - Mother, this is Ella, your daughter-in-law. Remember Ella? - Hello, Mum. - I don't have a daughter, I have two sons. Now, scarper! - Do you mind if I smoke a cigar around you? It helps me relax. - By all means. - She's a Polack from Poland. - Yes, I know, Mother. Remember, I hired her and pay her salary. - You know, you can never really trust the Slavs due to their incredible stupidity. You can't trust the stupid any more than you can trust a wild animal. Their stupidity makes them unpredictable, you see, dear. I once had sexual relations with a Polack. Big, muscular chap named Lucas. Thick as two short planks, but wonderfully handsome. - Fantastic. - His penis had the most incredible girth. Of course, I was still married to your father at the time, so it was all very hush-hush. - Lucky Daddy. - You know, your father never could perform sexually. Even on our honeymoon in Haiti, he was as shrivelled up as a prawn. Who is this vulgar woman again? - I told you, Mother, this is Ella, my wife. Remember our wedding? That's why we're here today, Mother. We have something important to tell you. - I thought you were after something. - Mother, Ella is pregnant, we're having a baby. - You're having a child, did you say, dear? - That's right, Mother, you're going to be a grandmother. - Oh, my dear boy, she's absolutely disgusting. She'll make an awful mother. Once again you've managed to shame our family name. - At least I didn't drive my husband to commit suicide. - What an embarrassment that was, suicide. I didn't know how to explain it to the neighbours. I just had to tell them all he had sorta sudden bout of cancer. - Any news from William? - William? - Yes, Mother, my brother. Your youngest son, William. - Oh, I thought you were talking about the perverted old fool from number 68. - My brother, Mother, has he called you? - My son William, he's a drug addict. - Yes, have you had any news, has he called you, has he been round to visit you? - Well, he's a mess, isn't he? - So, you have seen him, he's been around? - Who, dear? - William! - He's a drug addict, dear. Me and your father found a Red Devil drug in his bedroom and threw him out. - That was years ago, Mother. Try to think carefully. Has he been round to visit recently? - He's probably dead, dear. Drug addicts tend not to live long. - You're talking about your son. Don't you give a shit? - How old are you, Ella, 35, 37? - Mother! - A woman in her 30s is far too old to be having children. - Are you really going to let your mother speak to me this way? - The child will be born a mongoloid if you're not careful. You do know, mongoloids upset me greatly, don't you, dear? - Oscar. - Are you gonna lock your child up in a cage if it's a mongoloid, dear? - Ignore her. She's old and crazy. - She's talking about our child. - What would you have me do? - Putting her out of her misery would be the kindest thing to do. - She's my mother. - I wished I wasn't your mother. I wished the same about you and William. You were both such ugly children. How I envied the other mothers with their beautiful, handsome boys, and how I was always so disgusted by the sight of you two. - You really want to, don't you? - Where's that Polack, it's time for my medication. - You had your medication 10 minutes ago. - Rosemary, Rosemary! - Yes, Mrs. Knight? - Where's my medication? - You have just taken your medication. - Is she always like this? - She's getting worse, Mr. Knight. - She's always been a little bitch. - Where's my medication? - She has to be in a special facility. - I am not locking up my mother in a old people's home. - It is the best place for her, Mr. Knight. - I can think of a better place for her. - If it's more money you need, please, just ask. - Six feet under. - Bring me my medication this instant, or I shall scream. - You see what I have to put up with? - Please just be patient with her. - Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Somebody, help me! I need some Red! - Ah, Oscar, Ella. How the fuck are ya? - So, any word from my brother William? - No, sorry, Oscar, nothing. So, Oscar, tell me, how's things? Are you looking after my little sis? - Barry, you and I both well know that Ella is the one doing the looking after in this relationship. - Good girl. - But Barry, we have some wonderful news. You gonna tell him? - Shall I? - Go on. - Well, you know, me and Oscar have been trying for a baby. - Oh, really? - We're having a baby! - Ah, you've actually done it, Oscar! Well done, mate, well done. Ah, you know, I always thought your swimmers were like, you know. - Limited. Yes, but with a little help from our favourite gynaecologist, and a lot of faith in the man upstairs. - Amen. - You're gonna be an uncle. - Whoa! Butch, champagne, just two glasses, please. - Yes, boss. - So, I think it's time you two should retire. I mean, you must've made a fortune over this past few years. What's it been 80, 90 robberies? I bet you got yourself a nice little nest egg. - Once we've finished this final chapter, taking care of this Hugo fellow, that's exactly what we'll do. - Forget Hugo, forget Red Devil, Ella's pregnant. You can't do another job. She'll miscarry, for Christ sakes. - Hey, fuck you, Barry, I'm only three months. - What's wrong with you two? Oscar, you should know better. - We must finish what we've started. - Which is what? - To rid the streets of Red Devil. - Ah, Jesus Christ, you're not going on about that vision? You do realise, you sound like a madman when you talk like that, don't you? - I couldn't give a shit what anybody thinks. - I know my husband, Barry. He wouldn't make something like that up. If he says God came down and spoke to him, he came down and spoke to him. - You're both as fucking crazy as each other. - I know what I saw. - So, God came down to you in a dream, and he said, "Rid the world of Red Devil"? - It wasn't a dream, it was a vision. - Oh, was you awake, though? - I was wide awake. I was more awake than I've ever been. God came to me. - What, like a man with a big white beard? Please, elaborate. - His voice, his touch, the light, it was, it was indescribable. And I knew right then and there that Ella and I were born this way for a reason. And our reason to be is to rid the streets of Red. - Well, you succeeded. Alfie's the first fresh lead I've had for Red Devil in two weeks. You've won, there's no more Red. Mission accomplished, loves. Your God is very happy that you've killed so many people, and flushed millions of pounds worth of product down the toilet. - Relax, Barry, you are so dramatic. - If I had known you were pregnant, I would've never introduced you to Alfie. Thank you, Butch. - Congratulations. - Shut up, Butch! - Thanks, Butch. - Speaking of whom, may I ask, were you that fond of that Alfie? - Alfie, yeah, he's a good man. Why, what have you done now? - So, you're absolutely sure that's everything? - That's right, man. Just, where is my money? - Snap out of it, Hugo. Give the customer his weed, and let him leave. - Hugo, you're hallucinating. - I think I'm hallucinating. - Oh, now, I understand the psychedelic sojourn into the parallel universe of your mind. - I love the new look, mate. - Why, thank you, rouge is all the rage this year. - Whatever, mate. - Why don't I entertain you with a story to help you on your new voyage? - Oh, I love stories. - I am from a small mountain village called Phantasmagoria, at the foothills of Mount Wraith, an ancient and noble people of immense faith, but limited technology. One cold April years ago, when I was barely out of puberty, we heard news from the city that soldiers were heading to the village to slaughter and kill us, for reasons too sophisticated for us to understand. We had sticks and stones, the soldiers had AK-47s. As was our custom, we consulted the eldest man in the village, a wise old man called Hellion. Well, Hellion pondered deeply. Finally he told us of a tale told to him by his grandfather, the tale of a magical plant called the Tiabolo. This plant has been blessed by Ares, son of Zeus, and God of War has a way of protecting the village from Nemesis, god of ill will and revenge. Hellion told us, just eating one of the plant's many leaves would provide every man with the strength of a lion, and the power of immortality. The problem was that the sacred plant could only be found in one place in the whole world, and that was at the peak of Mount Wraith, the steepest mountain in all of the village. A near impossible climb to reach the summit, but what else could we do? We were outnumbered and outgunned. - Suicide is your only option. - Suddenly everything was clear to me. And in that moment of clarity I saw a small shrub of weeds by my feet. This may not have been the fabled Tiabolo plant, blessed by Ares, but I considered, did anyone of my village actually know what this plant looked like? I filled up my satchel with the shrub, and called out loudly to my village, "I have it! "I have the plant of Ares!" Oh, the village, they cheered and danced, and my satchel was snatched from me, and taken to Herius to verify the authenticity of the sacred plant. Well, Herius opened the bag, and he looked at me. Standing nervously at the back of the hut, he smiled at me, nodded his head, and told the village that this was indeed the fabled plant of Ares. The men frantically began to rip leaves out of the satchel, and eat them, eat them. Some ate two, three, and immediately I saw these desperate people become fearless warriors of valour within two chews. The soldiers, unsuspecting of any resistance, were met with a force beyond what mortals are capable of. 3,000 highly-trained, highly-equipped soldiers were slaughtered by a barrage of spears, sticks, and rocks. - So, the plant you grabbed was the real Tiabolo plant? - Well, what is real? If you believe something is real, you can see it, you can touch it. Is that not real? It was real enough for my village of peasants to slaughter 3,000 heavily-armed soldiers. - Well, so, so what happened then? The army whatsits just left you alone? - Well, the leader, he heard of the use of the sacred Tiabolo plant of Ares and its mystical powers, and sent an army of 10,000 heavily-armed men, tanks, bazookas, and rocket launchers. Well, he thought that with the plant's power at his disposal, he could, well, he could take over the whole world. - Yeah, yeah, but the village, they fought 'em off because they, they believed that they had the magical powers. - Of course not! The army wiped out the entire male population of the village within about a minute. They idiots charged at the tanks with spears and sticks, believing they were invincible. Well, I, I hid in the trees with the elderly and the children. After all, survival is the most basic human instinct. - Mum, Mum! - I told you not to call me that before. You call Queen Beelzebub like everybody else. What makes you so special? - Sorry, Queen Beelzebub. - Well, take off your shoes. Oh, what do you want? - Mum, Mum. - What did I just tell you? - Sorry, Queen Beelzebub, I need your help. - Oh, surprise, surprise. - I've been shot, Mum. I'm fucking losing loads of blood. - Oh, and what do I look like, a fucking doctor? - I just need some Red, Mum. Please, just to help me knock the pain. Look, just help me, please, Mum. - Oh, poor Riley. Haven't you realised yet, Red Devil doesn't exist anymore. He's taken it back, he's gone. Submit yourself to him, son, submit yourself to Satan, and everything will be okay. - I don't believe in this voodoo black magic shit, Mum. I fucking need your help. - You won't even live till the morning, son. Go, I am with my real children. I'll see you on the other side, Riley. - I couldn't save your money, though, Hugo. I did try, man, but, as I went and got your money out of the cash machine, some big black blokes, they came out of nowhere, man, took all me wages. - Fuck, mate. - Hugo, I was lucky to get away with me life. How's things, man? - Things good, man. - Yeah? Good. Can I get the threesome with the two women and the one man? - Excellent choice, as always, young man. - Cheers, buddy. - Chair number four. - Same, thank you. - Did you just see that? - See what? - That pervert looked at me like he wanted to fuck me, right here in front of everybody. - Baby, a lot of people look at you like they want to fuck you. You're beautiful. - He's cuckolded you. - Jesus, Ella! - He's cuckolded you right here in front of Dylan. Aren't you embarrassed? - Lord, I think I go and take me break now, right? - Okay. Take your time. Ella, we do not have time for this. We have to get ready for the thing. - So, you're not gonna defend my honour? - Uh. - You're gonna let me, your pregnant wife, get sexually abused by some little pervert, and you're just gonna stand there and do nothing? I've never been so dry in all my life. - Fine, I'll get him outside, okay? - You're defending your wife's honour, and your manhood isn't too much of a hassle for you? - You're so fucking dramatic sometimes. - There he is, look at him. Fucking pervert. I mean, here I am, carrying your unborn fucking child, minding my own fucking business, and someone eye-fucks me in front of my husband, and what does my husband do? Nothing. Well, that was a bit sexy. - You can't carry on like this, it's not normal. - Maybe not to you. - You can't keep on killing people. - Barry, would you ask a lion to stop hunting wildebeest? - Yes, but you're not a lion, and neither is she. - We can't change what we are, Barry. - Oh, well, so you think it's all right to go around killing people just to satisfy your own sexual perversions? - Barry, you really must join us on holiday in Peru this summer. Wonderful place, and such an ancient culture. The Peruvians have such an incredible insight into the human mind. Do not search for faults in one's fucking gifts. - Peru is amazing, Barry. You wait until you try the ceviche. - The what? - Freshly-caught raw fish marinated in citrus juices and spiced with chilli peppers. - Whoa, whoa, whoa. - It's truly divine. - No, no, no, no, no, no, listen. That Peru, it doesn't sound like my cup of tea. - Ah, you're so fucking miserable, Barry. - Oh, fuck off, you. - Fuck you off! We came you to tell you about our good news, and all you have done is moan, moan, moan. - You can't go around and keep on killing people, can you? You crazy fucking bitch! - Are you really going to let him talk to me like that in front of you? - Barry. - And the same goes for you, too, Oscar. Listen, you two, the killing, it stops now! - Don't talk to my husband like that! - Listen, you're gonna be parents. I mean, what kind of an example are you trying to set? - Ah, fuck you, you know what? You are uninvited to Peru. - Oh, fuck off, you. That Peru sounds like a load of fucking shit anyway. - No, you fucking little cunt. - You see her, she's been crazy, you know that, Oscar? From the first time she arrived, right, at the orphanage from Brazil, it's all been, like, her main slaughter. Well, I'll tell you something now, enough is enough, Ella! - Hmm-mm, fuck you! Just now because you're a priest, that doesn't make you a saint. Do you remember Mother Monica at the orphanage? - Yeah, yeah, what about her? - You hated Mother Monica, you wished she was dead. - Ella, you poured gas on Mother Monica and set her alight while she was asleep. You crazy fucking bitch, you nearly killed the woman! Oh, what, you're gonna say, like, it was, like, the same as Oscar's excuse, was it? "God come down, and he just said, you know, "he said, 'You got to burn the bitch.'" - Leave my husband alone, okay? - I told you, it was not a dream, it was a vision. - I'm glad you came today. Honestly, Gabriel. - What you talking about? Pleasure's all mine. - No, I appreciate that you choose to chill with me. I'm honoured. - Someone's feeling sentimental. - Well, you know. I get lonely. Bored. I mean, the only reason I sell my babies to the public is for the company. I don't even make enough to pay for the food or the electric. - What you need is a woman. - No, I haven't got time for that. Who'd look after the babies? - You know, it's not too late to start a real life for yourself, Hugo. - What's wrong with my life? I'm a self-employed businessman. See, I'm one of this country's interpreters. - You mean entrepreneur. - Yeah, whatever. - Ever thought about getting yourself a job? - Fuck that, man. It's just too late to start something new. - If I ever hear that kind of defeatism from you again, I swear to God, I'll blow your fucking head off. - Lift your head up, sir, lift your head up. - Careful, fuck! - I'm applying pressure to stop the bleeding. You'll die otherwise. - I've got more important things on my fucking mind. What's your poison, man? What's the reason for you being in the situation you're in? Red Devil? Me too. So, I'm thinking, if I gave you some money now, you'd go straight back to Peccancy Street, and score some Red. - I'd spend it on food. I'd get a room for the night. I'd clean myself up, and I'd go and visit my mother. Then, I'll find my oldest brother, and I'll tell him how much I miss him. You see, sir, under normal circumstances, you'd be 100% correct. Under normal circumstances, I'd be in some doorway somewhere, Red running through my veins. But for the first time in years, I'm clean. I can't understand why, but, suddenly I can see beyond my next fix. - So, what happens when the drought's over? Will you go back to the doorway? Nobody can give up Red. - I have, I've given up Red. - I'm sure you think you have. - No, no, you don't understand. Earlier tonight, I was on my search for food. I was head first inside a dustbin, and I found this, I found this. I found this. I haven't even had the slightest urge. I can't understand why. I was gonna throw it away, but, I thought maybe I could exchange it for some bread, maybe, or some noodles, or something. That's okay. - What's your name? - It's William. - William, where did you get this, huh, where has it been? - It was, um, it was just outside the weed house. - What weed house, where? - You know, Hugo's greenhouse on Apparition Avenue. - My big, strong, handsome man. - What's got you so chirpy? - Defending my honour. Are you ready for tonight? - I will be once I've finished reading the news. - Right, I'll let you read your stupid news. - No, it's not that, it's just, there are lot of important things happening in the world. Just keeping abreast. - Do you think I'll make a good mother? - Ella, I think you are going to be the most perfect mother in the whole world. Oscar, I have a confession to make. - What is it? Please don't tell me the child isn't mine. - What? I'm not your mother, don't speak to me like that, okay? - All right, I'm sorry. - How fucking dare you? - I'm sorry. - I love you, Oscar, don't talk to me like that. - And I love you, Ella, with all my heart. What was it you wanted to tell me? - I don't want you getting upset. - What is it? - It's about your vision. - What about it? - Do you think Barry might be right, that you were just dreaming? - Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. - Just, that I know you're enjoying doing what we do, but it's okay, I like it, too. - Ella, I knew long before we we're ever married that I have a lust for violence. And I knew from the instant I saw you all those years ago, as I tortured your former lover, and you laid masturbating on the floor, that you are an erotophonophiliac. But the instant God came down to me, I realised it was our calling. This whole thing is our destiny. - It just sounds a little crazy when you say it out loud. - You're overthinking. Besides, you heard what Barry said. This is the first fresh target in over two weeks. Our mission is almost complete, so, let's have a little fun tonight. - Fun? Why, what are we gonna do? - You know what I'm gonna do. - No, I don't, say it. - I'm gonna take every gramme of Red that cunt has. - Not that. Say what I like. - I'm not gonna say it. - Say it! Say it, Oscar. - I'm going to blow that fucker's brains out. - Johnny. - Anthony. - Anthony. - I want an eighth. - Yes, no problem, well, come in. Take the weight off your feet. Want a cup of coffee? - No, that's the thing, I don't wanna come in, Hugo. I don't want a coffee, I don't wanna hear about the bullshit stories, the ancestry of your plants, anything to do with your plants. Fuck your plants, and fuck Purple Rabbits, actually. The thought of you and me sitting around in that shithole, listening to Purple Rabbits, is my living hell, mate. You do sell the best bud in town, don't ya? Yeah, you do. So, here I am tolerating you for the minimum timeframe that I can possible endure you for, 'cause, I have had a really long, hard day, mate, and I just wanna get stoned. So, I'll have an eighth of your strongest, man, please. - Fuck! - Oh, no, please! No, please, please, please! - If you ever come round here again with that level of rudeness, I promise you, I'll kill ya. - I'm really sorry, mate. Just take what you want, I'm sorry, it won't happen again. It was just a rough day. - You respect your elders, you hear me? - I hear you, man. I hear you, I hear you. - Good. Can I get that eighth, though, at all, please? - Fuck off. - All right. - What's his problem, man? - These kids nowadays, they got no fucking manners. See, the problem lies at home, with a lack of discipline. And sometimes life has to hand out those lessons that his father should've told him. Now, you keep this on your waste, close to you. See, Covet County is a dangerous place for a man of your work. Now, you're special, Hugo. You know that, don't ya? And everybody out there wants what you've got, so you protect it. - I'm lover, not a fighter. No, it's just, he's just a kid. He's just after bud. - Hugo, hey. How are you? Nice seeing you, hot guy, come here. Come here. Come here, give me a hug, come on. - We just want the Red and the money, then we'll be out of your hair as quick as you can say "Geronimo". - Fucking Geronimo. - Are you fucking with me? We want all the money and every speck of Red. And if you're very well-behaved, then you won't end up dead. - Now, guv, don't shoot, don't shoot. Don't shoot, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't. No no! This is fucked up. - Don't be such a baby. Now, they would've taken your money, your children, and probably your life, so this, this is the best outcome. - It's a fucking customer. - Just relax, and get rid of them. A scandal like this could hurt your reputation amongst the middle classes. - I'm not sure. - Relax, it's just a customer. - Hello, mate. Is it all right if I come in? - Oh, man, it's just, it's a bit messy. - Don't worry about mess, you should see my place. - Well, yeah, I suppose so. Come in. - What's all this, if you don't mind me asking, of course? - We're hunters. - Hunters. - Hunters, like pigeons and rabbits? - Badgers. - Badgers. Come. All right, come on in. Come, come, come in, please. Please come. Here you go, here you go, here you go. Come on, sit, guy, sit. What are you after? - Whatever. - I've got some sensational new bud. It's called Triple Cream Dream. - Well, actually, Hugo, oh, is all right to call you Hugo? - Well, only my friends call me Hugo. - That must mean we're friends, then. - Right. - Hugo, my friend, I need some Red, some Red Devil. - That's not cool, man. Look, that drug is a gift to the streets from the devil. If it's not a plant you can grow on God's green Earth, I'm not interested, mate. You see, well, you need that manmade shit. Why, let me roll you a big fat one, yeah, and you'll forget all about that Red bullshit, eh? - Hugo, Red actually does come from a plant. - What? - A rare plant what comes from the top of some volcanic mountain, or something. God, I don't know, it's something I've heard. - How do you know that? - Common knowledge. - This is my friend Gabriel. We've been friends for, well, years. - What happened to your arm? - I don't wanna talk about it. - No, we'll talk about whatever I wanna talk about. You're in my house, you little motherfucker, and I make the rules in here. - It's my house. - Look, if you're trying to test me out to make sure I'm on the level, I'm a cool cat, all right, man? You know, you'll have problems from me. I'm regular, you'll earn a small fortune from my custom. Come on, Hugo, man, you'll see. - Lemme blow this little devil dog away now, and we can bury him with the other two. - My friend don't like you, man. - Your trust will be your downfall, Hugo. I have told you this before. Enough with the talking, it's time for the bang, bang. - Oh, don't be such a spoilsport. He seems a cool guy. This is probably why people don't come round here. - Hugo, dude, who the fuck are you talking to? - My friend. - So, what is it then, hmm? You fucking tripping? Or do you actually think you can see someone? You know Gabriel's not real, don't you, Hugo? - What is real, man, hmm? Real is knowing when a customer's lying to me to get free bud. Or real is being lonely enough to let it happen, in the hope that someone might actually want to sit and socialise with me. See, real is knowing that when someone wants to steal something from me as precious as your children, you know, well, even a pacifist has the right to defend 'em, yeah? Now, if that means I have to hide behind an imaginary friend to do something that I don't want to do, eh? Well, fuck it, man. But real is knowing, from the minute I opened the door to you, that you was probably high on Red. But real, you see, is deep down, hoping that you would want to get to know me, end up liking me, and wanting to be my friend. See, we could chill out together, smoke some Js, listen to some Purple Rabbits. Well, I could tell you stories. Well, fucking no stories. But real is being so fucking high, I don't even know if you exist. - It takes more than knowing someone's name to be their friend, Hugo. - Shut up! - So, what next? - Well, now you've got two choices. First, we forget that this ever happened, yeah, and you flush that Red Devil shit down the toilet, and I introduce you to Mr. Triple Cream Dream. - Well, what about the second? - You hold on to that Red, and I'll shoot you dead. - I think I'll leave, if that's all right with you, Hugo. - No, no, tell me, what is it about me that makes it so difficult to socialise with? - Wait! Have you got any Red Devil? - Burn in hell, you crazy cunt. ♪ There's a place where nothing grows ♪ ♪ Only dust on the stones ♪ ♪ And No Man's Grave is its name ♪ ♪ There's no rest, there's no shade ♪ ♪ Only souls with no name ♪ ♪ The blackest hearts lie beneath ♪ ♪ Twisted hands, rotten teeth ♪ ♪ The hangman's rope did swing and sway ♪ ♪ No one prayed ♪ ♪ And No Man's Grave is its name ♪ ♪ And No Man's Grave is its name ♪
