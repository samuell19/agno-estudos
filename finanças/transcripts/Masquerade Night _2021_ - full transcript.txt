The police took a look just in case and it turned out there actually was a body This time the police received another by fax The police believe the report and fax were sent by the same person Is there a possibility that this report is prank? The police never disclosed any information about room 604 The anonymous tipper probably really knows the true identity of the murderer In that case, why didn't the anonymous tipper explain this to the police? I mean We know nothing about the anonymous tipper and the killer yet The only clue is the murderer will appear at this hotel today but there's something in our favor hotel staff are able to notice abnormalities that happen in a hotel No matter how small it is please let me know if you notice anything I understand but please understand that hotels also have hotel rules The customer is number one Nitta-san, it's not customer Ah, I meant guest Also, Ujihara-san will be in charge this time What about you then?

That's correct Thank you Please register here Please enjoy your stay Thank you I heard you have experience but you're not different than an amateur What's wrong with saying thank you for your patronage to a regular guest What's wrong When you look at his check-in record, did you notice anything? Check-in record Sono-sama always stays only during the day which means he never stays overnight at the hotel And only on Monday An affair? There's no mistake the woman he came with is his wife and it's the first time she is staying here But you still said thank you for your patronage to that couple Do you think it is appropriate? Guests who come to the hotel wear masks Our job is to protect their mask for them You will not receive guests from now on How will I search?

This case is full of mysteries What is the anonymous tipper's goal? Why did the culprit choose to kill by electrocution? And why come to this hotel The only thing that is certain now is the culprit didn't just come to just attend some party I'm going Welcome Welcome Welcome What if, she was influenced by the partner? You mean Izumi Haruna-san wanted to match the man's preferences I think there's more than that She might have been forced to wear lolita Kusakabe-sama, sorry to keep you waiting Do you have any good ideas Sorry Nothing Kusakabe-sama Can you change your meal time to 5:00 but the restaurant opens at 6:00 You can have the entire restaurant to yourselves for one hour and we will do the rose road, so your girlfriend will not find out I see Then, let's do that I'm looking forward to it Understood Excuse me What did the man request to you just now? Ma'am Sorry, but I can't answer your question I will be dining with Kusakabe at this hotel tonight I'm very sorry Because it is related to the privacy of the guests Please understand He is planning to propose to me, right? I am going to reject his proposal please this way My husband who made the reservation will be here later Understood How are you going to pay? with a credit card please I see Thank you for the card Please enjoy your stay May I?

He lives in America If I get married I have to quit my job as a teacher Midori Nakane but I really want to continue my current job Thank you for waiting, here is your credit card Thank you for registering I don't want to have bad memories for our last night Do you have any good ideas? Can you give me some time Please enjoy your stay Address is 5-27 Toyokita-cho, Owari City, Aichi Prefecture How is it? It seems that today is Nakane Shinichiro's birthday Nitta, it was a hit Nakane Midori is a false name They might be pretending to be a couple for some reason Welcome I want to change to the my room to a higher floor Kusakabe-samsa, I'm very sorry Today, the top 26th floor is fully booked I want to show my fiancee the highest floor in this hotel That's the woman Sono-sama's affair partner Sono? the one who stepped on your foot I guess it's not possible I will think of a way Kaizuka-sama This is the ticket to tonight's countdown party It must be a love affair Love affair? it's jargon for affairs Kaizuka-sama reserved a room for two people She's probably planning to meet with Sono-sama Thanks Then, I'll leave it to you Nitta-san Nitta-san Welcome My name is Yamada Takashi, I have a reservation Welcome Welcome Hey, the party doesn't start until 11:00 There are many guests who arrive in costume The hotel doesn't seem to care as long as the payment is confirmed How do investigate if we can't confirm their identity? What do we do about that clown? We can only identity by name It meaningless if they check in with a false name Then there's no way Calm down everyone I will try to negotiate with the hotel to confirm the identity of costumed guests There's not enough time Please continue to verify the identity of the party attendees Yes If the search inside the hotel is like this isn't it better to find the anonymous tipper who knows the culprit instead No news from colleagues outside The anonymous tipper is an anonymous, so there are no leads anyway This says there may be a female body Not there is female body but may be Don't you think it's strange? That true Why did the anonymous tipper use such a vague statement Chief , we just checked the identities of party attendees we found a guest who might be using a false name Who is it? That's him There are more suspicious guests arriving Just being suspicious is better than anything else Guests usually wear a invisible masks when they come but this time, they are actually wearing physical masks This is difficult I'm going Why are you here Can't I come Welcome, I will help you with your luggage No, thank you May I ask your name? It's Urabe I did a search in the national driver's license database for the name Kusakabe Atsuya None of the pictures match him It's possible Kusakabe is using a false name Maybe he just doesn't have a Japanese driver's license I don't think it is necessary to doubt him why don't you just tell him what she said How can I tell him I think it's better than being a rejected Kano-sama said she wanted to answer him in person 51 minutes left, it's impossible Nitta-san it's taboo, but if you can't do it, you can't do it We do more than we are told to do What's important is to take guests feelings into consideration and help them have a pleasant stay Guest Let us take your luggage over here No, thank you What's the matter? Sorry We often have golf guests staying at our hotel but it's rare for guests to bring golf bags into the room I'm going back to the front desk Please fill in your name, address, and phone number here It doesn't seem like Urabe-sama is attending the party How did you deal with that incident Kusakabe-sama wanted the highest room in this hotel He was satisfied with using the entire bar on the top floor I want to confirm the view from the bar in advance I'll show you I'll be going I've kept you waiting Goodbye Thank you Thank you It's heavy, be careful Okay You might as well give up Let's go I'll hold it Are you still doubting Kusakabe-sama? there are other suspicious persons like the man and woman in their 50s who were talking You mean Sono-sama? The truth is, those two are Love affair Did you already know Hotel staff should remember the faces of guests What did those two talk about? Sono-sama and Kaizuka-sama are regulars of our hotel I don't think they are related to the case You never know Maybe the man is up to something maybe he didn't want anyone to know he was coming to the party so he give the ticket to his affair partner in advance As usual, you view everyone as a criminal I don't know the specifics but they were surprised when they met I think it just happened by chance and they didn't plan to meet here But can it really be a coincidence? If it wasn't a coincidence? Or they playing hard to get to force a divorce? Hard to get? You can't convey your true feelings if your trying to be hard to get Yamagishi-san, when did you become a detective? When did Ujihara-san start working here? a year ago From Hotel Cortesia Yokohama Did something happen with Yamagishi-san? What? I feel there is some tension between them I think he doesn't want to acknowledge Yamagishi-san Truth is, next year There are plans to send an employee to the Cortesia Hotel Los Angeles and the two have been selected as candidates We have negotiated with the hotel on guests in costume We told the police this Guests who go out of their way to dress up for their pleasure and showing their identity is just unreasonable Please wait If they stay in costume we can't figure out the culprit Trust everyone After all, the hotel staff is only thinking about entertaining guests Doubt everyone In the end, all the police think about is how to catch criminals Among our guests there might be a murderer Even if there is a murderer Today is the same as ever, nothing will change If there is a murderer, no one knows what will happen Today is different from the any other day Why don't they understand You don't have to make things so complicated Guests do not know that our hotel is assisting the police No matter what, we have until 11 pm tonight You can serve as usual Do you understand? Yes You must find the culprit no matter what Yes Welcome, do you have a reservation? I will take you to the front desk Excuse me Yes? I want to pick up my boyfriend at the station Can you help me get my luggage to my room? What are you doing? Taeko 108 roses have a special meaning If you don't know, I hope you check it now Have you come up with a good idea? Kind of Please begin By the way, your watch is slow If your job requires you to be on time shouldn't you make sure it's accurate It's okay like this This watch is often inaccurate, and I don't usually look at it Please marry me? Why would wear a watch like that? It's my grandmother's heirloom Sorry look behind This rose path This is not a rose but a sweet pea Sweet pea? Do you know what sweet pea means in flower language? If you don't know, check it now Parting It should also mean to start a new life It's Yamagishi's suggestion she advised me not to play hard and should tell you my honest feelings Thank you Please have a safe return I really admire your service spirit No one can compare to you in this hotel What? I heard you have a chance to go to Los Angeles But I don't think I will be selected Why? I'm not as good as Ujihara-san Do you mean he is better than you? Yamagishi-san, there is a customer waiting at the counter Did you get rejected? What do you mean? About the victim's partner We couldn't find any clues What about the victim's phone? We couldn't figure out which mobile carrier Izumi Haruna was using for her phone I would assume her partner gave her the cell phone If he is the murderer then it makes sense for the murder to take the phone The culprit seems to be very cautious Not so much cautious but seems more skilled like killing using electrocution or not leaving any traces Don't you think the culprit is too familiar with murder? You mean it wasn't the first time the murderer killed someone? The culprit is very abnormal It is not surprising to think so I'll check immediately to see if there is a similar criminal method in the unsolved murder cases please do There's something I can't figure it out If the culprit is so skilled Why did he leave such important evidence as the child in her belly? Understood Then 10:00 What did you guys talk about Welcome Long time no see Something is not quite right about Nakane Midori Nitta-san As I told you before, I can't tell you about conversations between guests No That's true, but Hello, sir I have something else to ask you What's the matter? I want to go to a countdown party with her Who do you mean by her? the beauty who was just here Kusakabe-sama New Year's Eve is a special day for everyone The guest probably already has an arrangement I'm going to talk to her anyway it seems that this request is impossible for you Then how about this I'll find a place for you to talk alone You're saying you can do it? I will try to figure out a way then please What's with that man? and what's with you too There is no need to agree to that kind of request Hotel staff can't tell guests that they can't do it then what are you going to do this time Nakane Midori is not in her room, right? She seems to be going shopping with her husband then let's go to her room We can investigate her identity It won't hurt you to find out who she is Entering a guest's room without permission is out of the question for the hotel Of course I know But, I'm asking even though I know then please give up this idea Excuse me The lady in room 920 complained to us that the contents of her luggage have traces of being touched by someone Maybe she's just imagining The lady is very particular she has specific positions for the items in her bag We have explained to her was because the bellboy accidentally dropped the luggage but please don't do this again in the future then please allow us to confirm the identity of guests in costume We have already rejected that then can you at least let us investigate the guest rooms without their permission? It seems you still don't understand what it means to be a hotel even if it is an investigation We can't let our guests have an unpleasant experience If it's just a murderer visiting We are still obliged to provide services as usual Did you just say it's just a murderer visiting? Do you really think the murderer is just enjoying the new year by coming to this hotel? It's not just a criminal is coming to this hotel today it's a vicious murderer What are you trying to say? It's possible the murderer will kill someone today at this hotel Please help us It can't be helped I'll allow you to search guest rooms without permission General Manager but you can't make any mistakes again you can't touch any of the guests belongings A hotel staff must accompany the search There are my conditions It can't be helped Please enter Has Nakane Shinichiro already checked in? Nitta-san Nitta-san Do you notice anything? Nothing in particular I would assume they wanted to experience the feeling of being married Welcome back She really is alone There were cigarettes and lighters in the room usually you take them with when you go out The ash tray was also clean It seemed like the room was hardly touched and really clean What are you trying to say? Nakane Shinichiro hasn't come to the hotel yet Nakane Midori may be pretending to be staying together I don't think so A moment ago, I received a request from Nakane Midori-sama to prepare a cake like the one in this photo Today is Nakane Shinichiro-sama's birthday They seem to be celebrating together That may also be a lie for the hotel You really have to doubt anything No one has seen Nakane Shinichiro yet It's more strange if you don't doubt it What's the matter Can I really accept this? It's being given as a limited time gift on New Year's Eve to guests who order the special dinner through room service Thank you very much Can the cake I ordered be delivered by ten o'clock? It's being made right now I apologize for the sudden request on such short notice It's okay Please enjoy your time Excuse me We have figured out the location of where the anonymous tip was sent It was sent from a convenience store by fax in the Nerima district Nerima Does that mean the anonymous tipper lived near the victim? Maybe the informant was peeping? The victim died while laying on her bed But, from far away, it's difficult to tell and that's why the report was so vague If you report to the police, the peeping would be exposed so they reported it anonymously using the hotline How was the window when the body of the victim was found? I'll confirm it right away The curtain was half open then please do What were you doing? Is this your plan for Nakane Midori and Kusakabe to meet alone? This matter has nothing to do with the case You should cancel it Not just Nakane Midori, but Kusakabe may be dangerous No matter what I think, I don't think Kusakabe-sama is the murderer I'm not just saying the he is the murderer but, I'm sure he must be scheming something His goal, for example might be you Nitta-san A package for Urabe Miyuki has arrived Sheesh I don't care if you continue with your plan but as a condition, I will also help I understand Then at 8:30 Okay Urabe-sama, your package has arrived I'll put it in your room for you Go ahead Wait Excuse me leave the package anywhere there Understood Excuse me you said There seems to be a countdown party at 11 Yes Everyone is participating in costume It turned out to be a masquerade Do you want to join No I'm just asking then we will be on our way Excuse me Asking about a party you're not going to attend is kind of suspicious, right? One more thing This dog or cat hair was stuck to his coat means he has pets How is that suspicious? Did you forget The victim Izumi Haruna was a pet groomer in other words a pet stylist Check the victim's apartment and company cameras and see if Urabe show up on them Okay Sir If you don't mind, please use this Thank you you don't want to get older You know someone with the police in Aichi prefecture? I want you to investigate Nakane Shinichiro I don't want to owe them favors I admit I made a mistake, but it turned out fine then thanks for your help You are late Isn't it exactly half past eight? but you are actually five minutes late Strict punctuality is the iron law of hotel staff Welcome So, what are you planning to do? Daddy Long Legs what? First, from the hotel we'll give a special service gift to Nakane Midori and then we'll reveal it's actually from someone who wants to meet her that's why it's called Daddy Long Legs If you don't know the other person everyone would be curious, and would like to meet them You might be right but that's only if Nakane Midori is just an innocent guest Yamagishi-san, I can go alone If you, a concierge, keeps visiting rooms then it will make her suspicious You might be right and trust the customer, sorry I meant guest, trust too much and have no sense of danger we still don't know who the murderer is yet anyway, just leave it to me Please Be sure to tell her at the door I know I will never go in then contact me when you are ready Okay Excuse me, Nakane-sama Excuse me for a moment what I heard that today is your husband's birthday so the hotel has prepared a gift Is your husband here? He's out right now Is that so Then, I'll come back when you both are here Actually You can just tell me Understood Then Please sit in front of this window Please take a seat Allow me to dim the lights in the room We are ready Nitta-san, if you don't follow the rules then What do I need to do? You don't need to do anything Nitta-san Good work How does it feel to be a hotel employee after a long time Well I'm still constantly being scolded I was just scolded for being five minutes late After all, strict punctuality is the iron law of hotel staff there are some employees who wear inaccurate watches so it's a little strange I often teach my staff Don't rely too much on the watch The hotel is a special space A different time flows from the outside world If hotel staff keep looking at their watch Guests can't really relax You don't miss any details All staff here are all working hard to protect the happy time of the guests This is the service provided by this hotel Nitta-san then please Thank you for your hard work Hey, Nitta It was a hit It's a unsolved murder that happened three and a half years ago The victim was a 26 year old woman living alone in Saitama prefecture The culprit used a timer to electrocute the victim and the victim was wearing when she died was lolita fashion There's no doubt the culprit has killed two people including this time and three and a half years ago Administrator Ozaki The culprit might be wanting to commit a third murder here How long until the party starts There are only two hours left Nose-san, look for clues about the culprit from the case three and a half years ago as soon as possible Okay Also, the undercover team right now we can only rely on your eyes Please be sure to find the culprit Yes It's not just you in disguise The culprit is also in disguise Don't be fooled Yes by informant Come on, you got to be kidding Maybe it's too late When you went to deliver the room service was Nakane Shinichiro-sama in the room? No, it was just Nakane Midori Is that so Yes Naomi, the cake is ready Did you drop ths? Thank you No, that's not mine But Do you have business with the concierge? Please prepare a costume for me, the size is written here Understood Kawamoto-san, please prepare costume for Kusakabe-sama Okay It's like everyone seems like a criminal to you What you said is exactly the same as Yamagishi-san I am different from her I will never Disregard rules because of personal feelings She is indeed more emotional Especially when it comes to guests, but I think she's a good hotel employee Nitta, it's Inagaki Go to the lounge right now We might be able to find the informant Did you find something? About 20 minutes ago, we received a new report tip I will read If there's police on standby, then follow my instructions In the golden wine glass held by Madam Masquerade put a flower that means The informant will also appear at this hotel When we checked the home addresses of party attendees with the address of the victim in Nerima we found people who live within 500 meters radius Sono Masaaki When we investigated hs credit card history We found out he bought a super telephoto camera in October Keep your eye on him He will definitely go see Madam Masquerade Understood Hey Yuri That's Kaizuka Yuri What a coincidence Come on, they actually know each other Would you like to join us for New Year's Eve It's rude to invite people like that all of a sudden It doesn't matter Right? It would be rude to bother your husband Michiko, have a wonderful New Year's Eve Welcome We don't have enough blueberries and mint Almost done Please make it the same as the photo It's the request of the guest Let's go Yuri, see you later On the move I'll leaving for a bit Okay Please Understood If the informant wants to just catch the culprit then there's no reason to come all the way to the hotel What is the informant thinking Maybe they want to make a deal A deal? the informant was peeping at the victim's home knew the identity of the culprit by coincidence and demanded money They are dealing with a murderer, isn't it too dangerous that's why they made the deal location a masquerade party If you are here, you won't need to see the culprit's face then after the informant receives the money it's probably their plan to let the police arrest the culprit that's the venue Excuse me Yes Sono went straight back to the room but he might inquire about Madam Masquerade from his family Understood, Sekine continue to monitor from there Understood Here What's the matter? Urabe was captured on camera at the pet grooming shop It's two days after the victim was murdered What about the victim's apartment? The camera over there didn't capture anything That's for you He might have had some kind of relationship with the victim Go to check with the pet groomer Nitta, ​​there was news from the Aichi Prefectural Police Nakane Shinichiro is already dead Kawamoto-san, where is Yamagishi-san? She went to the guest's room to deliver the cake I'm getting on What do you think? The cake is wonderful My husband will be happy too I'm glad we made it in time It was okay to be a little late It's amazing I promised by 10 o'clock Nakane-sama, I have something to tell you What's the matter? In fact, the previous gift and floor projection weren't services from the hotel Excuse me, can you be faster? sorry, please hurry Why did Kusakabe-san do that? I don't know the specific reason He just said he wanted to meet and chat with both of you What do you think? of course I understand that you may need to discuss with your husband first Yeah But that person Do you really think he wanted to meet with the both of us? If so Where did he see the both of us? After all, I've always been alone There's no way I'll be able to finish such a big cake Please excuse me Nitta-san? Why are you here? Why am I here, Yamagishi-san, listen to me Her husband Nakagenshin How perfect I was inappropriate in front you and I was trying to explain to you too Welcome Welcome What about Nitta-san? last year on his birthday, New Year's Eve We decided to hold our wedding in this church I always I sincerely look forward to walking this holy road with him have a birthday cake prepared dance at the masquerade party dreaming of welcoming the new year together But He suddenly disappeared from my side It was cancer I made a reservation at this hotel to forget about him I wanted to spend our last time here and then cut off my feelings for him it would be great if this time could continue forever while I'm at the hotel It was as if he was actually by my side But When watching the projection just now I clearly realized as I was looking at my reflection on the window glass that I was already alone It's very lively everywhere today but only here is very quiet I'm really glad to be at this hotel again Thank you for bringing me this happy time Was this really good? As a result, I've revealed Nakane Midori's mask I think it was okay how you handled it The reason why she is satisfied with the service of this hotel Because you are persistent like a fool and believed everything she said Persistent like a fool? even hotel staff don't think all the guests are good people but I understand In order to create a happy time for guests you have to trust all guests That's what hotel staff do, right? It's not like police like to suspect everyone I understand In order to find the bad guys, we have to suspect everyone That's what the police do, right? The two of us really chose very troublesome jobs Yes I think so too The lady who just went out is really a beauty Oops, did I bother you? Yes If you want to talk about work, I will leave first Do you want to hear too? The cases involve both sexes so I also want to hear Yamagishi-san's thoughts But Two people have been killed Nose-san Three and a half years ago A woman named Murase Ami was found dead in her home Cause of death was electrocution and she was killed wearing lolita clothes just like this case There's no mistake it's the same killer So, as I was looking through the investigation data again I found that Murase Ami-san was also dating Then, her lolita fasion was influenced by her boyfriend? I was also very curious, so I contacted him immediately to confirm with him but he didn't know anything about lolita What? He said he didn't even know Murase-san's home address Wait a momont, they were dating, right? I heard they just started dating, even if he said he wanted to go to her house she always said the home was mess and she didn't want him to see and rejected him every time Then her partner is innocent He couldn't have killed Murase-san at her home What if she was already in a relationship The mess at home was just an excuse the truth is she didn't want him to see traces of the other man Murase-san had another partner The two men found out and killed her It's possible Nitta Urabe is a false name as expected, his real name is Uchiyama Mikio He is also connected with Izumi Haruna Understood, I'll go right now What's the matter? Urabe was a false name as expected and he seems to have a connection with Izumi Haruna-san Nitta-san Please don't forget that Urabe-san is also our guest A highball whisky strong Understood Huh, Uchiyama-san? Oh, what a coincidence, to meet you here It's me, Motomiya You know, the other day, in the Nerima's pet grooming shop waiting room Hello Did you hear that the pet groomer was killed there if I remember correctly, she took care of your pet Sorry, I drank too much, I'm going back to my room Please register your name and room number here Thank you very much he might be the murderer like we thought Urabe definitely has something to do with the case He was captured on surveillance camera at the pet grooming shop Someone meticulous wouldn't have made such a mistake Welcome Welcome The old Nitta would have wanted to reveal the true identity of the guest any way possible He has also changed But, Nitta-san must follow the rules of the police and I have to follow the rules of the hotel We are inseparable I think that's why You can be the best partner People are interesting If you live within the rules eventually following the rules ends up being their only goal Why do you think rules exist for police? They're for catching criminals, isn't it? that's part of it Nitta-san suspecting people and uncovering people's masks and even going to Nakane Midori-san's room it was to fulfill an important purpose The most important purpose? He wanted to protect you Nitta-san is here to protect the lives of everyone at this hotel That's the same for you too, right? Ladies and gentlemen Welcome to Masquerade Night There is less than an hour left this year Please raise your glasses Cheers Cheers Welcome Everyone listen carefully It's 11 o'clock and it's the last hour Although we couldn't identify the costumed guests Don't lose track of Sono and Urabe no matter what The informant might be blackmailing the culprit If this is the case, the murderer won't leave the informant alone they will try to kill them for sure Don't relax for a moment until the party is over be sure to watch both the murderer and informant and then let's all welcome a wonderful new year Urabe just left his room, he's disguised as a penguin What about the money? He is carrying a golf bag The money might be inside Thanks It's Sekine, Sono has also started to move He's leaving the bar soon we don't know where he'll put on the mask, keep an eye on him Understood if they are trying to hand over the money, then it's most likely at the party venue Once they meet, catch them Understood This is the 27th floor, he's about to take the elevator Thank you Which floor do you go to? Welcome This is the 3rd floor, I don't see Urabe Urabe got off the elevator on the 2nd floor 2nd floor Motomiya and Nitta, go to the 2nd floor immediately You go to the 3rd floor Yes This might work Nitta I'll go inside Thank you I'm going to a convenience store Where is Sono? He just left the hotel What? I'll follow him just in case Sono may not be the informant but he lives near the victim's home and even a super telephoto camera Hello What happened to Urabe? He is at the wedding shop on the phone Damn, what's going on October 13 there's record of Sono-san's credit card being used He bought a super telephoto camera He also order gift wrapping Gift wrapping? Thank you It's really diffuclt Sono-kun What's the matter? Is it a good time? The identity of the informant has been confirmed The one who discovered Izumi Haruna's body and reported it to the anonymous tip hotline was Sono's son Where is your mother? It was Eita I don't know at the time, he discussed it with his mother The informant is Sono Machiko Where is Sono Machiko right now? We are still searching She should be somewhere in the hotel She might contact Urabe continue monitoring him Hello We have confirmed the informant is Sono Machiko The culprit might be watching her If you see her please contact me immediately I understand What's the matter? Is it really her? I don't think Sono Machiko who is staying at this hotel for the first time would pick here as the deal meeting place Urabe is coming Chief, Urabe is out He left the golf bag inside Got it Understood Let's follow Hello I found someone who looks like Sono Machiko Where is she? In the lobby She dressed as a witch with a snake staff I'll go right there, please keep an eye on her Yamagishi-san You still don't seem to understand The most important thing now for a hotel employee is to provide the same service as usual This is the hotel policy The culprit may be trying to kill someone in the hotel and Nitta-san is trying to protect these people I want to protect the guests too Sono Machiko disguised as a witch with a snake staff and is in the lobby Welcome Okay everyone, just now Sorry, please put on a mask Please give a warm applause Thank you The party goes on Let me introduce the next performers Nitta, where is Sono Machiko? Where is Sono Machiko? I can't find her How about the wedding shop? No one appeared Motomiya, where is Urabe now? He is drinking in front of the champagne tower Hello Where is Sono Machiko? I'm sorry, I lost her Where are you now? I was with Machiko-san just now Hello? Hello? Sorry, I'll call you back later I have one last thing to ask you I want you to help me find a dance partner Nakane Midori kindly rejected me I don't want to spend a bleak night alone You can try to find a partner by yourself don't you understand I don't want to be rejected anymore Hurry up, the dance is about to start I'm sorry I cannot meet your request Are you trying to say that you can't do it? You are a concierge It's your duty to think about the happiness of guests You're right but tonight is masquerade night You can wear a costume and dance all night as much as you want and we can't interfere with that Please have a wonderful night, sir It must be a love affair The identity of the informant has been confirmed the two of them know each other About 20 minutes ago, we received a new tip report Sorry It's okay Tonight's main event The dance party is about to begin Sono Machiko has been confirmed at the dance party and can be arrested Okay, let's capture Urabe too We may be mistaken Are you Urabe, please come with us What's going on? Are you Sono Machiko, please come with us wait a minute let me go Chief Urabe is not the murderer, he is the bait What do you mean? So far the police have only been watching Urabe We have been tricked by the real culprit Are you okay? Are you okay? Are you okay? Why did you come to this hotel? I was threatened By who? I don't know I suddenly received this email If you don't want your relationship with Izumi Haruna to be exposed, then follow these instructions I If Urabe is the bait, then what's the culprit's goal? It's must be to kill the informant Hey But we already caught Sono Machiko She didn't book the countdown party in advance but was still able to attend the dance because someone else gave her the ticket It's Kaizuka Yuri As long as you give me money, I won't tell anyone I'll call again Kaizuka Yuri is a regular and knows the hotel very well She has two tickets it was for both of the informants Please put on a mask Please put on a mask Sorry Not a drink, give me that Where is Kaizuka Yuri? I don't know How is that possible? I really don't know anything I just gave the peeping photos my son took to Yuri Blackmail, preparing the plan and everything Fine, what kind of costume is she wearing? You must know at least about Kaizuka Yuri's costume She is wearing green lolita clothes in a moment, only 10 minutes remaining Kaizuka Yuri is wearing green lolita clothes Everyone search every part of this hotel Can you tell me your name? Time is up Ladies and gentlemen, let's dance together this last evening of the year Do you have any clues about the murderer of Izumi Haruna? No Then, let me ask you a different question Have you been to her home? Never Why? She said her room was too messy and didn't want to show me Ridiculous I'm really sorry please, please be sure to save Yuri You should stop with the bad acting Isn't this what you really wanted Someone to kill the hateful woman who took your husband That's not true If you are really are worried about Kaizuka Yuri Why did you hesitate when I asked you about her costome Wasn't she dating other people besides you? What do you mean? What I mean is If you mean When she met me someone would always call her she said it was someone from work, and not to worry about it Do you know their name? I think it was Morizawa Hikaru Morizawa Hikaru Morizawa Hikaru Morizawa Hikaru The police will find out the truth If you are hiding anything else it's best to tell us now The murderer's name is Morisawa Hikaru This name is not on the list of the participants It's probably a false name Captain, any other information? That's all The murderer must be at this party We let Sono Eita Help me identify the photos of the participants But Morizawa doesn't seem to be among them Are you alone? It is said that two men can also dance Argentine Tango Yuri was shrewd woman since high school The one who came up with the idea of threatening the culprit was actually her idea, but When I found she was going use the Cortesia Hotel Tokyo I had an intuition That Yuri is my husband's affair partner since I already knew my husband was using this hotel for his affair That woman didn't have any guilt towards me I was shaking with rage It was then Is this Sono Machiko-san? Yes I am Morisawa Hikaru How do you have my number? You look good in the red coat For intimidation We sent the candid photos to Morisawa I guess He probably found out about us from those photos What does Morisawa Hikaru want? He wanted me to tell him everything about the plan I knew I was going to be watched by the police and told him everything Then why didn't you stop the deal? He threatened me back Let Kaizuka Yuri continue the deal then I'll save your life How could I reject such a good proposal? I'm going to get the money now Then what should I do The murderer is now at the party hall, disguised as a penguin You keep watch just in case something goes wrong Yuri, I wish you a wonderful New Year's Eve You dance well Your steps have no hesitation, your amazing You are the murderer, right? I would never forget those eyes even after seeing them once your eyes are very attractive Nakane Midori-sama? or should I say Morizawa Hikaru? Where is Kaizuka Yuri? What are you talking about? even though you are a woman you did a great job with the lead role That's because You usually live as a man You came to this hotel specially as a guest also to check the security level of our police but a woman coming to the hotel alone at the end of the year It would be too suspicious for the police so you come up with a way if you're going to be suspected, then you wanted the police be completely confused The police surrounded by countless suspects Once the doubt is solved, no one will suspect you that's why you made up a sad love story Where is Kaizuka Yuri? Go ask your precious partner Officer Nitta What do you mean? 20 seconds left After 20 seconds, you lose When the New Year's Eve countdown ends Kaizuka Yuri and the hotel woman will fall into eternal sleep It's very lively everywhere today Only here is very quiet Chief, Kaizuka Yuri is at the chapel Morizawa Hikaru is disguised as The Phantom of the Opera Arrest immediately Happy New Year What is your motive? to silence people, you don't even need to ask That's not what I'm asking about I'm asking about your motive for killing Izumi Haruna then again I also don't mind if you tell me for Murase Ami I have no reason to tell you Then you can listen to my imagination Morizawa Hikaru is biologically female but usually living as a male Her twin sister, Sera, is her most important person when they lost their parents in their teens The two have been relying on each other to get by Her sister was raped and committed suicide at age 21 and died in front of Morisawa We speculate the reason Morizawa used a timer was to not watch the moment someone died ever again You lost the most important person in an unfortunate way In order to fill the void in your heart, you were looking for a replacement for your sister You made the victims wear lolita clothes to turn them into your sister but no one could replace your sister You choose the method of killing by electrocution because you didn't want to hurt the bodies of those you thought of as your sister Are you satisfied? They call that being a sore loser You seem to be obsessed with winning and losing Of course For me this case is also revenge To avenge the police who killed my sister her sister, Sera appears to have been severely humiliated during police questioning also known as second rape She committed suicide shortly after being questioned Morizawa must have hated the police If she murdered with complete police security then it would have ruined the reputation of the police That might have been what Morizawa was planning Please enter Excuse me General Manager Fujiki You are I didn't expect it to be like this I thought of my sister's feeling of regretfulness Every day was miserable that's what lead to this I thought this was a great opportunity to avenge my sister I saw you not working at all at the front desk I knew right away that you were a detective what happened afterward was really fun But, in the end You still couldn't stop me from committing crimes Countdown to failure It's was a good performance, wasn't it? The way you guys were panicing was great Although your tango was really good it's unfortunate Your revenge failed What? Kaizuka Yuri and the hotel employee, Naomi Yamagishi, are not dead How come? There is no clock in the chapel You set the timer with Yamagishi-san's watch, didn't you? So what? Her watch is about 5 minutes slow Call an ambulance She's alive, still alive Kawamura, call an ambulance I will call Can you hear? Are you okay? Hurry Kaizuka-san? Yamagishi-san? Kaizuka-san? Yamagishi-san! Are you okay? Yamagishi-san! Kaizuka-san? Are you okay? Kaizuka-san! Can you hear me? Nitta-san? All right? Kaizuka-san? I'm glad you are a hotel employee, really What are you saying? which means the timer was actually set to 12:05 so the electrical device didn't turn on at 12:00 The hotel staff here don't rely on clocks because if you rely on clocks it is impossible to provide special time for guests This is the service spirit of this hotel Don't be so full of yourself That's just a coincidence I won I beat the police True You may have won the battle But we didn't come here to compete with you! After coming here, your words and actions were full of lies except one thing mixed with the truth December 31 is actually your birthday, right? that is to say It's also your sister's birthday She chose suicide on her birthday Your tears were they real? I learned a lot through this incident You too I'm really sorry this time Everyone, you did very well this time Dismissed Thank you for your hard work Return to the station It's so cold Happy New Year Oh, that's right after all events like New Year's Eve have nothing to do with us Let's go have a drink Let's go No restaruants are open right now Then let's go back Let's go back Yamagishi-san, how are you? Are you okay? How was it? The doctor said there was no problem Sorry for the inconvenience Why did you do something so dangerous? Why? You are not a police officer but a hotel employee The hotel has the rules of the hotel As a police officer, you're not qualified to tell me what to do Well, everything turned out okay, so it doesn't matter now Right? Once again the hotel staff was put in danger I'm very sorry Nitta-san, please don't apologize The action she took may have indeed been impulsive and dangerous But as a hotel employee it was the obvious action to protect the most important things The ones who put her in danger might have been actually us Kosaka-kun This is Kosaka-kun from Cortesia Los Angeles Kusakabe-sama? I apologize I promised with the general manager to come after the new year but I wanted to see how you two work normally It was a slightly early test Test? Then that proposal was she is my assistant Even if you didn't do that can't you tell who is a good hotel employee I may have gone a little too far but now I'm sure Yamagishi-san when it's something related to guests for you you get overly emotional I won't become like that However It's not me who should go to Los Angeles but a hotel employee like you I'm planning on reporting that to Los Angeles It's really difficult Hotel Cortesia Tokyo will lose a capable staff member I heard from the police The reason why the murderer noticed Nitta-san's identity was because of my poor managing no, that's not true I will be careful next time No, I don't think there wil be a next time Right? Hopefully People who come to the hotel wear masks this place isn't just about being glamorous even still, hotel staff try to let the guests enjoy a happy time by guarding everyone's masks A hotel really is troublesome place But I also want to be able to enjoy such good service as a guest Everyone I wish you all a prosperous new year Thanks for your help Please have a safe trip back Please have a safe trip back Happy New Year I look forward to working with you this year too Thank you, we look forward to seeing you again I'll show you the way Thank you very much Good bye Naomi-san Be sure to come back Please have a safe trip I will go and be back I heard you are leaving today What's the matter? No, you came because of that? I have something to ask you I was wondering if you could make a dinner reservation for two Understood, what day? The day you came back from Los Angeles What? But if after you come back from Los Angeles, you will want to eat Japanese food, right? So But the Teppanyaki here is famous, isn't it? What I'm trying to say then a table that can enjoy the night view Nitta-san I'll leave the time up to you Not that I wouldn't mind French food again and toast with red wine It's impossible What? You said it's impossible? I have properly received your request as a guest Then please Nitta-san I will definitely become a good hotel employee and come back I will also try to become a better detective Then Have a safe trip Have a safe trip
