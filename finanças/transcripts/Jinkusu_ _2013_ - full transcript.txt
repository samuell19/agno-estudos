South Korea Franz Liszt, Liebesträume no. 3: "Dreams of Love" Tae-Woong. Ji-Ho. It’s alright. Once I’m in Japan, I will forget about Tae-Woong That was why I decided to study abroad in the first place. Remember to dry your hair before you sleep, or you will catch a cold. I’m going now. It’s alright, Ji-Ho. It’s alright. Smile. As of today for the next three months there is a new student with us. From Korea, Yoon Ji-Ho. Hello, I’m Yoon Ji-Ho. I’m nervous. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. Kimchi stew. So today is the 20th. I need to return the book. Ji-Ho is still learning Japanese, so please look after her. Yes. Sit down here. Nice to meet you. Is this seat taken? Huh? I’m Yoon Ji-Ho, nice to meet you. Yoon Ji-Ho, 1993.12.27, Type 0. On this? I have to? - Yama... Yama... - Yamaguchi Kaede. Yamaguchi Kaede, thank you very much! You’re very nice. Not really... It’s fate! What? Kaede and I, the blood type and birth date, it’s a good match. Unnie has B, I have 0, Unnie is Virgo and I’m Capricorn! "Unnie?" Unnie means older sister. Older sister? Our birthdays aren’t that far apart. Something very good will happen for Kaede unnie and me. This is Jinx! Jinx? Become my friend. Please look after me. Let’s eat! My God... What a beautiful girl! Look, look, look. What is it? Since when was she in this class? Cute! It’s just kinda unexpected... - What? - Nothing... Wait for me Kaede unnie. Why are you always following me? What? All friends in South Korea hold hands! Not in Japan! Do friends usually follow you everywhere? But this is a school library so anyone can come as long as you’re a student. That’s true, but... But what is she interested about you? We go well together because of our birth dates and blood type. Just with that? That something good will happen by being together is a Jinx. Jinx, huh? But isn’t that nice? How so? Because something good will happen. What are you waving at? That smile, don’t you see it? Kaede unnie, you like books? What kind of books do you like? Love, romance? Mystery. If you don’t mind, could you be quiet? Sorry. You know Ji-Ho, you and I are not alike at all. Our horoscopes and blood types might be a good match, but our fashion sense and lifestyles I are completely different, aren’t they? That’s not true. Kaede unnie and my lifestyles are the same. How? You see... ...that ... I like being alone. You’re not like that. I like eating my meals alone too. Ah, eating meals alone, big no! Why? Because... it’s delicious. If you eat it alone, it’s not so tasty! But if you eat with someone, very tasty! Hello. You’re Yoon Ji-Ho, right? I’m Hayato Matsuzaka, faculty of economy. Do you remember? We’re in the same comparative culture class. This is my contact. My Twitter and address are here, so if you’re ever interested. You can also take this chance to study Japanese. What are you doing? You suddenly disappeared on me... Ji-Ho, this is my friend, Nomura Yusuke. Hello. Hayato, let’s go. See you later Ji-Ho. Follow me on Twitter. What? Kaede unnie let’s drink! Why do I have to drink with you? And don’t just enter... Because you must drink when talking about romance. I have no idea what the heck are you saying. That’s fine, drink, drink! You said that in Japanese? Here we go! One shot! This sake is actually delicious. Isn’t it, isn’t it? Drink, drink! No way, that’s not how it is. There’s no mistaking it. Kaede unnie definitely likes that guy! Based on what? Because Kaede unnie got mad. Because I got his contact info. Am I wrong? What are you talking about? Matsuka Hayato. Kaede unnie likes you. No! It’s notlike that. Hes not the one I like. He? Then who? This bear is cute! Did your boyfriend give it to you? Just as I thought, you have a boyfriend. It must be nice having one. Let’s go, one shot! One shot... Why me... Kaede unnie, he’s here! Nomura Yusuke is here! Idiot, don’t say it out loud! I don’t know anymore... Nomura Yusuke? Yeah. He told you, didn’t he? The one with the hat that came by afterwards. That plain person? Kaede unnie, you have a strange taste. What, what? Nomura is my classmate from middle school. My first love. First love? In South Korea, your first love is very important! Beautiful, so beautiful! Kaede unnie! Kaede unnie, why are you avoiding Yusuke? Avoiding? I’m not avoiding him. You didn’t say hi. You said you two were in the same middle school. So what’s up? It’s just... sort of awkward. Autumn? Aut...? In 2nd year, Nomura and I were in the same class. One time in pool class, his leg cramped, and he was drowning. Since I was near by I went to save him. But because of that, Nomura became the laughing stock of the class. Mind your own business. We haven’t talked since then. He transferred to Tokyo after graduating middle school, so we weren’t together anymore. Yusuke, finish that up quickly so we can go. Almost done. I think he doesn’t remember anything about me. Did Yusuke say that? No. we haven’t talked ever since then. Why? Well, if I really knew that he completely forgot about me, that would be too painful. "Ijime?" It’s something like feeling sad. Sad. Why does Kaede unnie like Yusuke? Why? I guess it’s because he praised me. Praise? Before the pool incident, I defeated a male student in Kendo class and got first place. The guys around me all avoided me, but only Nomura gave me a lot of praise. That was so cool Yamaguchi! You’re so cool! "So cool Yamaguchi! You are so cool!" But I guess it’s alright like this. There’s nothing good about me anyway. I have such a poor personality and my face as well.. I guess you wouldn’t understand. That’s not true! It’s because you have a boyfriend. I’ve never had one. It’s alright, Kaede unnie. It’s alright. (괜찮아요) Gwaenchanhayo? It’s means it’s alright. Kaede unnie, do your best to be confessed to. Fighting! I’ll support you. Support, no need! Besides you’ve gotten being confessed to and confessing to mixed up. No, no! A woman like Kaede unnie to confess. No way! But a man like Yusuke to confess. Like that would happen. Why are you setting the standards so high all of a sudden? A woman should never have to confess. She will never be happy then. This is Jinx! Jinx... It’s alright! Kaede unnie I will teach you about "mildang". Mildang? Mildang... Love bargain? Mildang - means to play hard to get, or pull and push literally. What is this? What’s up? Mildang, a South Korean love term for "tug of war". Wow, this seems pretty funny. Isn’t it? But it sounds a bit interesting. Are you serious? Just kidding, this seems very troublesome. Isn’t it? It’s a part of the everyday life of South Korean friends. Hey, where is Ji-Ho today? She’s at Ryoko’s place. This is called a Korean class, but just having a conversation is fine. If there is anything troubling you while living here in Japan, let me know. Thank you. What is that? Oh, that is a Buddhist altar. It’s for worshiping and praying to your ancestors and passed away family members. The deceased? In Japan, we also do this to pray for blessings, and worship our ancestors and passed away family. Are there no Buddhist altars in South Korea? No, there aren't. Who is this man? My husband. Your husband? Yes. Is it very surprising to see such a young picture of him? He passed away from illness exactly 20 years ago. It’s such a pity. I'm so sorry. It’s okay. Oh that’s right, I have souvenirs from the students here. Lee Tae-Woong, 1993.7.15, Type A. Here, Ji-Ho. Don’t you feel lonely? Your loved one has passed away. It’s already been a long time. Besides there is someone else I love now. I’m sorry. Hello, this is the girl's dormitory. I’m Matsuzaka from Faculty of Economy. Is Yoon Ji-Ho home? - Meeting? - Correct. I never thought Korean girls are that shy. People say just two people meeting for the first dime will bound to fail. Does that mean you will be dumped? No, I looked it up on the web. In South Korea, you start by going to these meetings with your friends to have a better understanding of each other. Those are called "meetings", right? The kind where you meet in a café. You sure know your stuff, but recently it seems to be in a bar. Don’t you think the meeting is a bit... Help me out Yusuke. Ji-ho also said she will bring along an especially cute girl. Especially cute, huh? I’m begging you. And I promised Ji-Ho that I would bring you. Or rather, Ji-Ho specifically asked for you, so please come! Meeting? In Japanese you call it "goukon". Hayato promised Yusuke will come. Why did you do that on your own? Or rather, are you okay with this? This is a meeting all for your sake, also.. Yusuke's twitter! How? I searched Hayato’s followers. If you want someone to like you, you must first understand that person. No, forget about it. lt's not good to just look into people’s Twitter. By the way I’ve been thinking. I’m glad for Ji-Ho feelings but, "mildang" seems like a "koi no kake hiki," doesn’t quite appeal to me. "Koi no kake hiki?" 'Koi no kake hiki" means... You make yourself look very good by lying and keeping secrets from others. All to make the other person like you. No, no, "Mildang" and "koi no kake hiki" are totally different. Mildang really means to be liked by your partner more you work hard and do your best. That’s mildang. But... Kaede unnie, do you think yourself as very lucky? I don’t think so. Then do the mildang. You don’t have to do anything and the person you like will come to like you. Now isn’t this very very lucky? Am I wrong? Balboa Yusuke? He likes action films? Action films? Especially the boxing movie "Rocky". I also watched "Rocky The Final" once. The action was cool and the dialogue was good. "There is no punch as heavy as life." "But the most important thing is being able to endure... any setbacks you come across and surpass them." Kaede unnie, you know it well. The truth is I also like good action movies. I watch them often. But I prefer Jackie. Jackie...? Jackie Chan? That’s right. You have peculiar tastes. Why don’t we just forget about it. We don t have to buy new clothes for the occasion. No, no, it’s really important for a girl to make an impression. What? Yusuke likes hats. It looks good on you Kaede unnie. Is there a better color? No! The lucky color of love is reddish pink. That’s a Jinx. Again with the Jinx? Does Kaede unnie remember? Not to talk a lot. Boys want people to hear their conversations, and they hate girls who talk a lot. Ji-Ho, over here, over here! Hello! Ji-Ho... Is it you, Yamaguchi? Hello. You, you know her? Since when? Since middle school. You should’ve told me sooner. You knew about it too, Ji-Ho? Then please sit with us, since we’re classmates. There seems to be a lot of good things to eat. My stomach is really starving. You’re really starving. So let’s order something that has a lot. I want cake, cake! Cake? Ah, ice cream! Anything else? One shot! More, more. Let’s do more. Let’s go. One shot! Delicious. More, more. Are you airight? I’m alright, I’m alright. Kaede unnie deal with Yusuke. Let’s drink more. Yeah, let’s drink. One shot. Drink, drink. Do you like hats? Eh? The one you were wearing before. Uh, this? That. Just a little... Kaede unnie loves hats. And action movies. She also loves "Rocky". Really? Rather than Rocky.. well I guess I like all action movies. Is that so? I like Jackie too. Jackie, as in Jackie Chan? Because, because I think he’s cool. Putting his life on the line to portray a character. But I can never put as much effort as he can. I can only admire him. The first time I saw his movies, I was blown away! But I like Rocky too, especially "The Final", even though he was 60 years old, he pulled through with all his strength, in the final scene, he give a real punch. I felt that had such a huge impact. I especially admired him after watching it. Unnie! Kaede unnie... Sorry. Hayato. Matsuzaka, are you really okay with treating us? Yeah. In South Korea, of course it’s the guys who pay the bill, right? For the both of you. Thank you for the hospitality. Let’s go home. Going? What about karaoke...? Kaede unnie! You failed! A girl shouldn’t talk out so much! I’m sorry. I guess I was too shocked? Did he ask for your contact info? Are you airight Ji-Ho? This is a complete failure. I even drank so much to let you talk with Yusuke. Sorry Ji-Ho, you went so far for me. Even so l am no good, I failed... Yamaguchi. Nomura. You forgot this. Thank you. Uh, Yamaguchl... do you use Twitter? If it’s airight with you, you could follow me on Twitter, and exchange info with me and my group who like action movies. Do you have your phone? Then I am sending it. My Twitter address is also on that. See you. Ji-ho... Ji-Ho! I did it! Thank you. Why shouldn’t I follow him? Not that you shouldn’t. Just today you shouldn’t. Why? “Is she going to follow me? Will she not?" It should make Yusuke really nervous. That’s the important thing. It’s too late. I already followed him. Already?! Kaede unnie, you shouldn’t have! Thank you for folowing me so quickly. I came to like Rocky during the spring of the 3rd year in middle school. When I saw ‘Rocky The Final’ with by dad, I really liked the part where Rocky said to his son that you must endure whatever comes your way and keep going forward. I didn’t tell my dad. I liked Jackie when I was in high school. I happened to see "Project A" on television. I don’t know why but I started tearing after seeing Jackie push on after being so beaten up. Lately I’ve been seeing the latest "007" series. Daniel Craig’s action is cool! The blond hair 007! It was great, wasn’t it? The action was beautiful. I also like the running pose, it’s cool. Today the clouds have cleared so it’s pretty. I think the sunset will be pretty. - Love tweeting every day like that. - Seriously, isn’t it tiresome? It’s not like that. Look at this. What’s that? You plan on taking Ji-Ho on a date. Right. This time I will definitely take her out. You should stop playing around on Twitter too. Ask Yamaguchi out on a real date. She will definitely agree. Really? Well, that doesn’t mean I will ask her out. Well that’s fine with us. Yay! Today is kimchi chicken! Which means that Ji-Ho has been here for a month. Well think about it kimchi chicken was also served on the day that you came. It’s a regulation here that kimchi chicken is served on the first day of each month. Why? Isn’t this Ms. Ryoko’s preference? She likes Korea. Thanks for the food. There is a movie coming up, won’t you join me next Sunday? No way! Nomura invited me to see a movie. That’s great! Isn’t that great Kaede unnie? Thank, you Ji-Ho. But you can’t go to the movie. No to the first date. You must refuse. An absolute must. Why? Because if you agree, we won’t know Yusuke’s true feelings. If he truly likes you, then he won’t give up even after you refuse him. But... If you agree on the first date, you won’t become lovers. You will only be his friend, this is Jinx. Jinx... There is a recommended movie, but would you like to watch it together next Sunday? Sorry, I’m late. It’s alright. There are others... Come here. Ah, excuse me. This is Yamaguchi Kaede who is joining us for the first time. These are Twitter friends who enjoy action movies. That hat is cute. Yes, she looks like Rocky’s lover, Adrian! Adrian? Which one in the ‘Rocky’ series do you like? Which do you like? I like "Rocky 2". I like "Rocky 4", when Apollo dies. Rocky Balboa is the best. Was the movie fun? These kind of meetings happen often? Yeah, but this is probably the third time so far. Watching action movies alone is a little boring. Is it? I always watch alone. Sorry. Guess I’m not very feminine. Rather the being with many people, I’m more comfortable alone. I’m used to doing everything on my own. You were like a boy since you were young. That’s a little... I don’t mean that in a bad way. I thought you were cool since middle school. Even when you saved me from the pool. You dragged me out of the pool all by yourself. But because of that, you mere made fun of by other kids. You mean the Aoki gang? I never cared about that. Really? Maybe not never. I purposely tried my best to be a man about it. Because of that I thought you didn’t like me. I thought it was you who didn’t like me. You even disregarded my conversation starters. I didn’t. You did. I said I didn’t. What? Don’t get angry. I didn’t get angry. Yusuke! What is it? Come here. Where did you go? Come a little closer. What did you think about the movie today? It was very exciting. Welcome back, Kaede unnie! How was the date? You agreed to go, didn’t you? How was the date? You were right. I was just one among his friends. Just a friend. Before going to watch the movie. I thought I would be fine with that too. If I can be even just a friend, that’s fine with me. However... I’m weird, right? I get more and more greedy. Kaede unnie... Why am I feeling this way? Even though I know it can’t happen. I’m really clumsy. You’re not! You’re cute. Kaede unnie, you’re very cute right now! Ji-Ho... Please have faith. Unnie, you and I, if we’re together, good things will happen. This is also Jinx. So if you earnestly do mildang, you’ll receive Yusuke’s confession. I’ll... ensure it! Ji-Ho. Your Japanese improved so much. All thanks to Kaede unnie. Yamaguchi has been pretty silent lately. Don’t peek around at other people’s things. It worries you, of course. How’d it go with you? Give me a hand. The aquarium, did you go together? I gave up. Why? Turns out Korean girls are rather annoying. From the first day of dating, you must celebrate every 100th day anniversary. Every anniversary the guy must prepare an event and give a present. That’s a little tiring. Right? Besides... I think she has a boyfriend. Eh? In Korea. Really? Seems like it. You must have been upset. Not really. It was more of a relief to find out about it early. - Really? - Yeah. I mean we have so many things to do from here on. Next year we have to think about employment. After employment, I have to think about marriage or kids. My own time will keep decreasing. That’s why right now I don’t want to be involved in those troublesome things. If love was solely enjoyable it’d be good but if it’s a headache it’s not needed. Isn’t that right? Yeah... Poor youth. Boss. Well, it’s not like I don’t understand how you feel. If you live like that, you won’t even experience the best happiness. If you are moderately happy it would only moderately pain you. In every greatest happiness, there is also the greatest pain. But the kind of life you live is your choice. Japanese cuisine? I can do miso soup... Nomura is inviting me to go see another movie. A date? Want to go see the new release of the Dragon Eyes’ together? I don’t know. Yusuke! You brought the CD, right? Thanks. Sorry, this time I’ll pass. Was that really a good thing to do? Rejecting? Don’t worry. If he really likes you he will definitely invite you again. That’s where I have the least confidence. This is my own special manicure. If you receive a confession with this polish on. you will become happier by all means. That’s also a Jinx? That’s right. Ji-Ho did you also receive a confession from your boyfriend with this polish on? What is this, you tightly seal your lips when I ask about you. What kind of person is your boyfriend? Tell me. Extremely... Extremely romantic person. Romantic! Every anniversary the two of us... reenacted the greatest scenes from melodrama movies. Amazing! Which ones? Come on, tell me. Which ones? All done! This flower is a ‘touch me not.’ It’ll put a spell on you. It’s really pretty unnie! It really is! Thanks, Ji-Ho. It’s cute. You look weak. Your manicure is a mess too. When did you paint it? Two weeks ago. Why don’t you erase it? Want me to lend you my nail polish remover? It’s fine. It’s still there. Yusuke! Yusuke! What do you think about Kaede unnie? Why that question all of a sudden... You like her or not? Which one? If I have to say, I think I like her. Then why do you ask her out just once? Well, she’s the one who rejected me. He likes Rocky, but he’s not manly at all! What? Ah, really what could she possibly see in him? What are you babbling about? (알았다) Airight. What guy does that?! You get rejected once and you give up? No! If you really like someone you have to try several times! No matter how many times, keep trying! Keep moving forward! If you give up easily it’ll never work! You’re kinda like Rocky. I’ll teach you how to ask someone out. If you do as I say, Kaede unnie will definitely agree. Understand? Yes. Um... I... I would like to return this. You know, Yamaguchi... Do you have time this Sunday? When you ask for a date you must first confirm the person’s schedule. Ask their schedule. If free, it’s hard for Kaede unnie to refuse. I see. Sunday... Nothing really. I have tickets for a classical piano concert... Would you like to go with me? Classical? She probably wouldn’t be interested. Romantic situations are very important. Classical concerts give off a special vibe. Is that so? Classical? Not interested? Of course not... The most important thing is... To assure her that it’s just the two of you alone. Yeah, I got it. Don’t worry about it. The method of taking out the ticket is also important! You can’t just take out the ticket! The ticket is enclosed in the book but you can throw it out. Anyway, it’s not like I have someone to go with. No one else is going? I only have two tickets. When you’re asking her out, you have to look directly into her eyes. I asked in case you wanted to go with me. I’ll go. I want to go. What do I do, Ji-Ho?! I still can’t believe it yet. Don’t move. My heart is still pounding. Will I be able to sleep today? Ji-Ho, were you notable to sleep well the night before your first date? No. I slept well. You’re lying. It’s a lie. I couldn’t sleep and ended up falling asleep at the concert on our date. Ji-Ho, you also went to a concert on your first date? What kind? Never mind that. Thanks. Kaede unnie, you didn’t forget right? I know. Now can I go? No. Try saying it. Listen well to what he has to say. Don’t say too much myself. That’s right, and the most important thing is smiling! It’s a smile! Fighting! Kaede unnie! Yes! I’ll try my best! I’ll be back! Sorry I’m late again. It’s okay let’s head inside. Welcome back, Kaede unnie. Did you enjoy your date? Yes, I enjoyed it. Did you receive a confession? Why? I created such a romantic situation! So why didn’t you confess?! I did. Don’t lie! I did, but she simply dismissed it. I... The truth is I've cared from before about you... What? Those words are...? She just stayed silent with a horrified expression. I dozed off during the concert. So I thought she was mad. From that point on I couldn’t say anything. Oh, Kaede unnie. But more than that... What is this guy?! Ji-Ho...? No, really why can’t you just say it so that she understands, huh? You can’t convey your feelings with "I care about you." You seem kinda angry... Yusuke, let’s practice how to confess! Confession practice? Practicing the reenactment of mellow movie scenes, how novelty. That’s how everyone did it at the university I attended. In Korea when you’re dating, romance is very important. They really pay attention to the movies and practice. Ji-Ho, I found it Rocky how does that sound? Rocky? How’s that? Rocky’s Southpaw declaration to lovers skating. There’s no way! These can’t become romantic lines at all! This is my most anticipated scene. Romantic lines are very important! Don’t you have anything else? Romantic movie? I don’t watch mellow movies... Then Ji-Ho, what movies have you tried? You must have tried it with a boyfriend? Tell me about it. Please! Please? Huh... "Edward Scissorhands" "Eternal Sunshine" "Eternal Sunshine" is... Even though the memories are erased, a story of liking the same person all over again. "When Harry Met Sally" sure brings back memories. You sure know your films, Ji-Ho. It’s a good choice. Let’s try guessing which scene Ji-Ho tried out? In "When Harry Met Sally..." The last year-end proposal scene? Correct? It has to be. The proposal lines are awesome. Citing all the shortcomings of a person, and saying you love it all. The final lies are: "Before I sleep the only person I want to converse with is you." I can’t do that! I can’t say those things... We're not asking you to say the exact same lines from the movies. Put your emotion into words by arranging your own words. That’s even more impossible. Again! You can’t give up so easily! Try saying something. I can’t. Ji-Ho, I surrender! No! Ah he just wants to quit whenever I tell him to do something. Calm down. Ji-Ho you must have done, "When Harry Met Sally..." What did your boyfriend say? For reference, teach him. Yes, please Ji-Ho! “I like the way you quickly get angry.” “I like the way you always make me wait for our dates.” But I can’t understand Korean. I’m not doing this! Think about it on your own! That’s very important! But, I’m... not good at saying romantic things. How about another movie? Let’s see... "Love Actually." 'Love Actually" will definitely have it. The man who fell in love with his best friend’s wife pretends to be the Christmas choir, delivers his sad heart written in a sketchbook. Correct. "The Notebook..." Ah, is it that scene? You open your eyes, while in bed, there is a row of arrows... That’s not it. Then, it’s this! In the middle of the night, lying down on a crosswalk. Correct! It’s that scene, laying on a crosswalk at night. The two of you lie and have a talk. Whenever the traffic light changes, nervous at the thought of an oncoming car. That’s risking your life. Dummy love means to always put your life on the line. Right, Ji-Ho? That’s a little odd. What? Nothing, how about something else? What about this? "Edward Scissorhands." Edward Scissorhands is... That scene! Having two hands as scissors. You want to embrace each other but can’t... Not that. It’s not? Then what... Snow. Snow? Thinking of his lover, Johnny Depp uses his scissorhands to cut up the ice, scattering the snow. Oh, really? He scattered snow? Are you serious? Of course snow is impossible. Soap bubbles. Soap bubbles? Instead of snow. He spread tons of bubbles. With the help of surrounding people. 100 days after our first date, it was our first 100 day anniversary... I was very happy but I felt a little bashful... Like in the movie, wanted to dance, but I couldn’t. I suppose you couldn’t. But... I was really happy! The soap bubbles! I’m sure you were. Good, that’s it! Yes! Yusuke. You too will become a fool! I will fully support you! What? Boss, let me borrow all these DVDs. That’s fine of course, but... Oh, that’s right! You want to show these to that Kaede? Right, the receiver has to know the movie for it to be effective. Good morning! Practice for receiving a confession? That’s right. You want to receive a confession from Yusuke? That’s true but... Let’s put some effort into receiving a confession on your next date! Practice for receiving a confession. 1. Always smile with a pretty face. 2. When you’re listening to him speak, look into his eyes. 3. Be alert to the romantic situations. Smiling with a pretty face. I don’t have the confidence. Don’t worry. I’ll show you the method of smiling prettily. Really? There is a method for that? Yes. When you’re listening. It’s very important to look into the eyes. The person confessing is in a nervous state. If you don’t look at them and don’t smile, he will think that you’re ignoring them. Ignoring... Even without saying that you like him, convey your feelings. This is also important for receiving a confession. I see. What about the third? How do you practice that? For you Kaede unnie, I put a lot of effort into making this. Look at this, study the romantic situations! "Love Actually" "Eternal Sunshine" There’s also a DVD. This is for me...? Thank you, Ji-Ho! I’ll really try my best! Here you lift both ends of the lips like this and say "eee..." Pretty smiling face! Kaede unnie, smile! You forgot to smile. Yamaguchi, about this... What are you doing? Ji-Ho, work is over. Let’s go. Kaede unnie, no! Look at my face! Say it again. Sorry, I forgot. Ji-Ho, let’s go together. Smile! Smile. We’re practicing here? The boss said to use the office, but... I didn’t want it to be seen. So which movie have you decided on? "Love Actually"? I thought this would fit me the best. You write in a sketchbook, so saying the words isn’t needed. Why you! No, it’s romantic. I’ll start. “I... like you.” That’s too direct! No, no! “You are my... hero.” Hero? That’s for men! Next one! “You are... prettier than my turtle.” What the heck is that? No! No! I chose some background music for when I do the confession. Listen to it. Yusuke, you can’t! You have no music sense either! You don’t have to say it like that... Really... Do another movie! "The Notebook"... Yusuke, the traffic light isn’t changing to red. It’s the one where you press the button. Should I go press it? It’s fine! More importantly did you think of some romantic lines? Try saying them. You are.. No, you are.. Ah, can’t help it. What do you like? Saying what you both like and bit by bit, it becomes romantic. Really? Really. Try saying it. What I like... "Rocky". Forget Rocky for a bit! What else? Hats... Beans. My pet turtle. And... what else? The smell of rain. The smell of rain. On rainy days, when you go to a park or a forest, the plants are wet, so there is a nice scent. I really like that smell. Tae-Woong also liked the smell of rain. Tae-Woong? Oh no! This is really going to be difficult. What’s this? “I like boyish you...” Stop teasing me. I think this is very silly too. Why are you doing these things? Just simply confess. When Ji-Ho talks about the memories with her boyfriend, there was a moment I saw the extreme happiness in her expression. I was very very happy! The soap bubbles! Even after time passes, because of the person you like, if you could have that happy expression with just a memory. That’s what you call romantic or whateverl Even if I’m a failure, I told myself I should give it a go. This guy, you’re a little cool. Cut it out... Sorry. No, I’m sorry. Are you searching for something? A book on the rural population decline. It’s in bookcase 17. Thanks. Please return by the 11th. You know Yamaguchi, you’ve changed a little. Really? You’ve become kinda similar to Ji-Ho. Can’t be. Can it? Late again. Ji-Ho! At least listen to it first. You’ll like it this time. Franz Liszt, Liebesträume no. 3: "Dreams of Love" It’s completely romantic, right? It’s a song I heard at the classical concert l went to with Kaede. I dozed off pretty much the entire time, but I remember this song. Sorry... Did I say something wrong? I’m sorry. Ji-Ho, welcome back. I have to forget about it... But why do I keep thinking about it? I’m in so much pain, Tae-Woong. Ji-Ho, are you airight? If there’s anything wrong, you can tell me. I’m always relying on you. If there’s anything I can do... Ji-Ho? Have you eaten already? So good! This place is really good. I’m glad. So you were homesick! You really scared me. As soon as you came out of your room, you kept saying you wanted to eat pork. Oh, I’ve watched all the movies you lent me. They were interesting. Really? Romance movies are a bit silly, but... They are good if you watch them seriously. I was immersed in them. Speaking of which, you said... You and your boyfriend reenacted romance movies on your anniversary. Were they the movies you lent me? Yes. Must be nice. I’m jealous. Which movie did you like the most? It’s probably "Eternal Sunshine." The Honeymoon on Ice. When they lay on the ice and guessed the constellations. That part was nice. It was romantic. I liked that scene the most too. Really? Then you must’ve been really happy when you reenacted it with your boyfriend. I wanted to do that one the most. The Honeymoon on Ice. But that’s the only one we didn’t do. Why? Oh! You will do it when you get back. Right? Kaede unnie, truth is... Must feel good. Something so romantic probably won’t ewer happen to me. I know that it’s already over. Nomura hasn’t contacted me ever since then. But, I’ve decided... to try my best while you’re still in Japan. Many good things happened when we were together. That’s Jinx right? By trusting in that Jinx, I got to see him. Would that tree be fine? Yes. I have to say this? Me? All of it? Yes, it’s important to be accustomed to romantic lines. If you are, it will be easier for you to say it more naturally. Is that so? Try reading them. I like your short temper... I like how you’re a bit late... Not like that. Say it slower! With feeling! I like your short temper. I like the way you always make me wait for our dates. Look at me, Yusuke. I’m Kaede unnie, alright? Alright. I like how you get angry right away. Yusuke! How you make me wait for you on our dates... I like it. Yusuke, look at me! Look at me and say those lines. I like how you quickly get angry. Hey, Ji-Ho. Go on. I like the way you always make me wait for our dates. I like the way you poke your nose into others’ business. I even like that you’re shy and not confident. But to be honest... Honestly... Ji-Ho! Are you not feeling well? I’m alright. Let’s do it one more time, from the beginning. Are you alright? You seem so lifeless. That’s not true. I’m fine. I’m going to go buy some juice. I wonder what’s up with Ji-Ho. Nomura Yusuke Ji-Ho? Something came up... See you at Yahata Park around 3:30. Did you get that, Ji-Ho? I’m out of battery! See you later. Did something happen? Nothing. Why are you so late? Sorry, but I gave you a call. You called? I don’t have any messages. But earlier... Whatever. Let’s practice, we don’t have time. I like the way you poke your nose into others’ business. That was really good Yusuke, I think you’re ready to confess. Really? Now all you have to do is replace it with your own words. My own words.... That’s the hardest part. These were the lines your boyfriend thought about, right? That’s what he really thinks about you, right? It’s great. He really likes you from the bottom of his heart. What’s wrong? Ji-Ho? Thank you, Yusuke. Thank you. Yamaguchi? I’m sorry to bother you. Kaede unnie! You’ve got it all wrong! Hear me out! Please listen to me Kaede unnie! It was a practice! We were practicing a confession. Confession? Yes! Yusuke likes someone, but cannot confess. He has zero romantic sense. That’s why we were practicing a confession. So that he could make a romantic confession. Practice? It makes sense. You’re a romance master. You could’ve explained it to me earlier, though. The one Nomura likes isn’t me, right? That’s why you couldn’t say it, right? You think I would get hurt. It’s not like that You should have just told me earlier. Then I would have given up even earlier. It’s not like that. That’s enough, Ji-Ho! That’s enough. Kaede unnie... I’ll forget everything. The fact that I like Nomura. All the effort I put into it as well. I will forget everything... and return to the way I used to be. This will be easier. It was impossible from the beginning, for me to be in a relationship. Why? Why are you giving up so easily? If you reach out your hand and touch him. lf you talk to him, he will answer you back. If you want to see him, you can see him right away. Ji-Ho? Being able to be together right now, is like a miracle from God. It’s a beautiful thing. So why? I don’t understand! Why? Ji-Ho... My boyfriend Tae-Woong... died. One year ago... in a traffic accident. To forget Tae-Woong, I came to Japan. But it was in vain. I... can’t forget. Tae-Woong... Just to forget... Tae-Woong... is not here anymore. I can’t see him anymore. That’s why... But... Yusuke is here, isn’t he? Yusuke is alive, isn’t he? So why? Kaede unnie, you have feelings for Yusuke. How can you forget? Ji-Ho. Welcome back. I’m back. How is it? It tastes good. What a relief. Thanks to Ji-Ho’s kimchi recipe my stew skills have greatly improved. Thank you. How come you make kimchi stew on the 20th of every month? The truth is, the 20th is when my husband passed away. My husband really liked kimchi stew. He said he gains strength when he eats it. So he always had me make it. And when I started this work, I saw the weak appearances of students. I thought of my husband’s words, and when I made this... It became really popular! Ah, my husband must have helped me is what I thought. So I started making it on the 20th of every month. Ji-Ho. When I first saw Kaede unnie, she reminded me of my former self. Before I met Tae-Woong, I was alone like Kaede unnie. I always ate alone. I gave up on love. There is no one to love me. That’s what I thought. Lee Tae-Woong, 1993.7.15, TypeA. For a girl without any confidence. Tae-Woong would compliment me often. And he taught me... The joy of eating with others. The joy in liking someone. The joy of being in love... So, I wanted Kaede unnie to know this. I wanted her to become happy. But I couldn’t. I wasn’t able to be like Tae-Woong. Ji-Ho. Kaede unnie said she is going to forget Yusuke. But I just don’t understand. How can you easily forget someone you like? Is it even simple to forget someone? How can I forget the unwanted memories I have of Tae-Woong? I have to forget. I can’t not forget. You don’t have to forget, Ji-Ho. Forgetting is an impossibility. The good times with Tae-Woong will become memories someday. And they become a source of strength for you, Ji-Ho. They will become memories? That’s right. They did for me. Ji-Ho, are you back’? Have you seen Ji-Ho? Haven’t seen her. Is Ji-Ho...? She contacted me saying she will be staying with a Korean friend for a while. I see. Please return it by the 18th. Ji-Ho, I m sorry. Ji-Ho... "Honeymoon on Ice." "Eternal Sunshine." When they lay on the ice and guessed the constellations. I also liked that scene the most. Then you must have been really happy when you reenacted it with you boyfriend. I wanted to do that the most. The Honeymoon on Ice. But that’s the only one we didn’t do. Ji-Ho couldn’t do it. Yet I... I’m such a fool! Ji-Ho! I’m sorry for bothering you. Tomorrow at 7 pm, please come here! I’ll wait until you arrive! - Kaede. Hey! What did you want to talk about? Is someone else coming? No. Let’s go. Huh, wait. Careful. What are you doing? I’m watching the stars. Stars? Are you airight? But you can’t see the starts from here. “Honeymoon on Ice.” Ji-Ho, it’s the first snow. Let’s do "Honeymoon on Ice." I will be waiting at the skating area at 6 pm. - Tae-Woong. “Honeymoon on Ice.” “Eternal Sunshine.” You know... What? Do you know any constellations? Constellations? You know what? My back is super freezing right now. Oh, constellations... constellations... Starza! What is that? Like Ji-Ho said, you’re not romantic at all. What did you hear from Ji-Ho? You were practicing on how to confess. Wait, you know? Yes, I do. That’s why I know you don’t like me. But Ji-Ho worked this hard for me. I will also do what I can. Wait, I think you’ve misunderstood something. Just let me say what I want to say. Okay... I’ve thought about giving up over and over. Being the laughing stock of everyone in middle school. Things became very awkward for us, Because of that, I thought I could give up and forget. Yamaguchi... But when we met again in college, I couldn’t forget about you at all. Ji-Ho realized it too. But Ji-Ho said I can’t confess first. That’s why... That’s why... Say... "You love me." Say... Say "you love me." I like the way you get mad easily. I like the way you always make me wait for our dates. Yusuke. I like the way you poke your nose into others’ business. Truth is you’re shy and you don’t have confidence. I also like that about you. But truthfully... But truthfully... But truthfully The way you smile just for me. Your smiling face Let's go. is what I like the most. It’s okay, Ji-Ho. Smile. Smiling is for happiness. The greatest Jinx. But truthfully... I like the boyish you. I like the way you talk about Jackie Chan. The way you awkwardly smile sometimes is what I like the most. Thanks. Wait, seems like you’re misunderstanding something. This... What do I do now? Nomura? Sorry. You okay? So... Can I kiss you? Really not romantic? What are you talking about that’s so interesting? About your confession. That story again? I mean you’re too useless. The speech I taught you was pretty much used word by word. I couldn’t help it. That’s really how I thought. Still, in the end... it was my originality. Right! Before I forget... This is a present I’m giving to the two of you. Aren’t these valuable to you? And we should be the ones thanking you. Thanks to the two of you, I was able to recall the many fun memories of Tae-Woong. There were sad moments but I liked reliving the memories. Ji-Ho... They’re precious memories. Memories that gave me strength. Thank you! Now I can bravely return to Korea. Ji-Ho is already leaving next week. That’s why today there are a lot of procedures to take care of. Hey. There’s something I want to discuss with you. Kaede unnie and Yusuke are late. I’m going to miss my plane. What’s up? Please blow some bubbles. For Ji-Ho. Please blow some bubbles. Please blow some bubbles. We’re requesting of you. Please give me some. Please help. Please blow some bubbles. Please blow some bubbles. Thank you Ji-Ho. Thank you. It’s our 100 day anniversary. I request of you. Tae-Woong...
