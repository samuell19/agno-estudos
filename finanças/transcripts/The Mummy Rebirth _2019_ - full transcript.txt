- Sebek. Sebek. Sebek. - Reheema. - Sebek. - Reheema! Reheema! - The lost city of Saqqara, home of the first man. Built from clay. U-khany Sesebek and his love Reheema Mense have been reincarnate lovers for centuries. Legends evolve over time. No one knows exactly where it all began. A tale of two lovers charged with great purpose. A love meant to bring about prosperity and riches to the great lands. A bond meant to be carried out for eternity centered around a stone mazar. The two lovers charged with great purpose, fueled by an unbreakable bond, maintained the cycle of balance for centuries. Great kings and gods clashed all seeking the lost city of Saqqara and the power of the stone. A different prophecy has come to light. One of wrath and vengeance, and if ever unleashed, the two scorned lovers will bring about the apocalypse. - You just couldn't resist, could ya? - We are treasure hunters, right? I mean, we can't just borrow. - Free bird. Free bird. It's not nice to take things that don't belong to you. Why don't you come out real nice and slow like? We can kiss and make up. - Daniela. You mind telling me what all the fuss was about? - The lost city of Saqqara. - A map. - Not a map, the map. This can't be. Noe, take a look at this. - That's disgusting. - Just... Would you? Oh God, that's disgusting. - Looks recent. - That's not possible. What are you doing? - Every time you say that's not possible something impossible happens. - That's... That's absurd. - Do you remember our other cave guy, Bismak? - Of course I do. - Tall, kind, bit of an oddball, but congenial. What about him? - He died getting us the coordinates to this place after you said that it was impossible the ancient priests of Saqqara would dare think to booby trap the entrance to an embalming chamber. - Well, now that you mention it, I wasn't that fond of him. - Mm. Well, good thing he had a brother who doesn't speak English. - I found the map to the lost city of Saqqara. - Questionable. - And you're going on about booby traps. - A man's death. - And caves when we could very well be standing in a place that's over 5000 years old. - 4800 B.C. - Yeah, whatever. - The lost city of Saqqara, where the first pharaoh was born. - I went to the same school as you. I know the tales. Pharaoh's would be charged with reincarnating two lovers to bring about a plentiful harvest and renewal to their kingdoms. A cycle that must be continued or risk the wrath of the gods. - A risk that Pharaoh Tesnemar did not heed. He wanted their power to live forever and got greedy in the process. Cursed his kingdom. Blah blah blah blah blah. - Be careful! U-khany Sesebek. - Hey, Biyombo, could you... - What? A seal. - That's... Weird. - The seal is odd. - Odd as in good or odd weird? - I don't know, but I've never seen markings like these. And for this time period, it seems inconsistent. - I thought the lost city of Saqqara was of the old continent. - Precisely, but this symbol. It's unlike any carbon fiber or protein I've ever seen. I mean, the only thing I have to compare it to... Unless. That's not possible. - Biyombo. - Biyombo. - Biyombo! Hang on! Do you hear that? Hm. Nothing. - He didn't bury Reheema in the lost city of Saqqara. - How can you be so sure? - Because the lost city of Saqqara isn't a city. Look. We are to be the first to find Sebek. That was the arrangement. The tablet we found is not of Egyptian origin. That can only mean one thing. - This is it. - The power of the gods. Seriously, look at you. You didn't think I came all this way, tolerated your little sandbox adventures, for what? Treasures and riches? The stone of Zahad is the key to the one thing that money cannot buy. - Texts of Hades. - Now. If we're quite done with the bravado and the pleasantries please get on with it, my dear. What have you found? - Be careful. - Obsidian basalt. Used as a false mask to hide the tablet's true origin. - Are these men really necessary? - These men are part of the Piyidi tribe trying to protect their lands from the principality that keeps the rivers dry and the people poor so please show some respect. - One can never be too careful especially in a tomb that predates the... - Sager, our job was to find Sebek and conclude a search that began ages ago, a search for the lost city of Saqqara. - Well, I suggest you do your job. - This is... This is it. The encryption reads, "follow that which unveils itself in fire. "And in light never before." - Fire. Are you sure? It has to be something more. - I didn't see that coming. - You sure about this? - If we find the lost city of Saqqara first we can renew the cycle. What better way to stop it, but from the inside? Besides, you really think it'll stop? Be careful! It's very rare to have an unguarded tomb this far from Anubis or even the feet of Horus. - What is this place? - Hatusun. The room... of the in between. - This place is cursed. - Stay calm. What are the men saying? - The men believe this place is pure evil. - Hatusun. There's something written here. In this life or in the depths of the underworld - Calm. Stay calm. - Daniela. Holy shit. Do you think? - It is Sebek. - He looks scorched. Oh my God. - No. No mummy I've ever researched has appeared this way. - They burned him alive inside the sarcophagus. - But there's a message here. The path to life begins with death. And there's something else. - Daniela. They want you to stop chanting the evil words of a dead man. Shit! Hey! Oh shit. No time to site see! - That's not possible. - Let's talk about this after we make it to the surface! - We must seal this tomb. - What about your men? - The men knew what they signed up for. - We must this seal this tomb. - No! I have to find the stone! We're close, I can feel it. - If we don't seal this tomb, Sebek will regain his power. If that happens, there won't be a world to live forever in. - Go. Forward, forward. - These formations must be over 10,000 years old. - I think older. - They said this place belonged to Hades. - In your stories, what was the purpose of this place? - It is said Sebek and Reheema are to perform a ritual. A sacrifice of true love. - In my studies we spoke of nahem, but it meant great curse. - There are many curses. - Like one of reincarnation, over and over and over again. - No, it's much more than that. - Your people are at war? - My people are victims of the evil regime. It is not war if both sides don't believe they are on the side of good. - Now that Sebek is free, what of the legend of your stories? - I don't know. It wasn't supposed to be possible. - We just woke an evil creature from the dead. I'd say everything's on the table. - He needs two things to perform the sacrifice. Something about that pours from beneath that may reveal it. That's all I know. - Chaka! Come on! Hey, come on. Come on! - No, Sebek controls the dead. Reheema controls the living. The wounds are effecting him. We've gotta get him out of here. - Come on. - No, no, no. Stop, Sebek, not live time. Stop Sebek. Go, leave me, leave me. Go without me. It's not enough time. Stop Sebek, go. Go! Get outta here. - I found something! - They're right behind me! - You must hurry! - Disgusting! - You were going to leave us! - Be careful, I'm here under still order. As of now our business is officially concluded. You failed me far too many times. Because of you, I may have lost the stone for good. I trust that you can find your way stateside. - In what world would someone like you be better than me. You were playing the living dead from the start. - Let her go. We have to find Sebek. - No. - What do you mean? - I mean, something tells me Sebek is the least of our worries. - Look at this. Saqqara often referenced as the lost city. Believed to be located under the Saharan Desert. Said to be only accessible by means of the Stone of Zahad. Many have searched for the city to no avail. - The Stone of Zahad. And Sager thinks he'll be the first to unveil this wonder to the world. But who is Zahad? Why would his stones convey so much power? - Zahad translates to all-knowing. He must have been a deity of some kind. - And the Egyptian story is lush with vegetation. An Egyptian version of the creation story. - The stone must be the key. - But not just any key. A gateway between this world and the underworld. - For anyone to get a hold of such a power if it exists would be infinitely dangerous. They could tip the scale between who lives and who dies. - Immortality. True power. Sebek's tomb was away from Horus. - Because he wasn't of the royal court? - No, no, I think we're missing the bigger picture here. - What do you mean? - If Sebek is back from the dead, right, there's two questions. First, where's Reheema? Has she also been awakened? And second, what does he need to renew the cycle? - Well, what does he want with us? - I don't know. - Why would he spare your life? - Maybe he blames us for awakening him. - Maybe he needs something. Something that only we would know. Get down! - It says here something was used to sanctify Sebek's tomb. - Sebek's tomb? - The Scarab of Ra. The Scarab of Ra! - Wait for me! - What took you so long? - All the entry points have been compromised. That thing took down an entire unit. - That's not a thing. It's her. It's Reheema. Nothing leaves this room. Do you understand? - Torch lights. What do we have? - I don't know. - You, turn around. Turn around, let me see your hands! What? - The Scarab of Ra is gone. He must have come back for it. - This is really bad. It looks like something that we would uncover on a dig. - We have to go. - Well, let's figure it out later. Let's get outta here! What the hell did we just witness? - You know what, this is significant, okay? It's not a coincidence that he's back here now. - Well, let's figure it out later. Right now we have to go. First we have to contact... - Hello, little birdie. Tell me what you know. - I don't know what you're talking about. - The map. The scarab. Give 'em to me. - Look, there is no map, okay? We don't have time to be... - Stop it! - Seems like you're employer wanted an upgrade. Hey, love? See, you took something that doesn't belong to you. - Crow, if we don't stop Sebek from completing the ritual then we're all dead. - Not all. Not all. See, you don't get it, do you? You're just a bird fluttering about. Fluttering around in your cage. Get 'em to the truck. Let's see if you weasel your way out of this one. - Sebek. Sebek. - Don't go to America, Vikka? Don't go to America, Vikka! Stay here, Vikka. Learn about the wonders of the world, Vikka. Fulfill your destiny, Vikka. Destiny. That's strange. - Sebek. - Khufu. - Sebek! - Khufu! Good, breathe. Sebek is just an urban legend. The tale of the first man and woman creating you and I. Where did you get this? - The bedtime story is real, yes? - Show me. Run, Khufu. Take this to the others. Let 'em know the prophecy has begun. - Stop. - Is this really necessary? Some detail you have there, Sager. - You know, my grandfather, had character. A meticulous man. - Look who I found snooping around. - What a beautiful family picture. I was just explaining how my grandfather amassed the riches that you're privy to today. You see... without chaos... There can be no order. You have something very valuable to me. - You left us in that tomb to die. - Sebek is trying to bring about the apocalypse. - The apocalypse? Do you even know the meaning of the word? It means to reveal that which was once hidden. You know, my grandfather was stationed in Cairo during the war, somewhere beyond the outskirts of the city. Met a traveling man, faceless. - Is that? - The Book of Hades, god of the underworld. - You keep it here? What does it say about the ritual, about Sebek? The lost city of Saqqara? - I used to stay up late at night listening to him speak of the Stone of Zahad and the ancient battles of the pharaohs. Kings and gods. He spoke of one taking the place of two to become all. - Sager, he came to the museum yesterday. - Sebek? - He took the Scarab of Ra. - The Scarab of Ra? - He's here for the book. - Go find him! - We have to protect the book. - It could only go back to where it all began. - What does that mean? - You're a smart girl, you figure it out. - Watch 'em. - He's here. - Daniela, when this is all over you and I are gonna have to have a serious talk. You've been saying some really crazy things lately. - It could only go back to where it all began. - What are you talking about? - Sager. He said it could only go back to where it all began. - So what? - So even if he gets the book we still no where to find him. - And that will somehow give us more time to break the curse? - Yes. - He's still missing something he needs. - What is he missing? He has the scarab, he's here for the book. What else does he need? Where'd you get that? - Sebek gave it to me. - I can't, how? - We have to get out of here. No one is safe here. Not today, sandman! - Let's move, the book! - Everything's ready to go. - If you did your job then we would have the stone! - Sebek isn't going to the tomb to resurrect Reheema. - What do you mean? - He's going to the tomb to stop her! - And what would happen if he does? - The lost city and everything inside will be lost forever. - These helicopter blades, makes it a little hard of hearing. Makes me all crazy. Got me all foggy. - I didn't see a damn thing. - We cut them off in the desert up ahead, but we do this my way. - But what happens when we catch 'em? - I don't know, be creative. Take the next chopper out, but take out the trash. Let's go! Immortality awaits! - We won't... - Sager's a maniac. We have to find Sebek. - I think we just did. - Stay here. - Stop! Noe! Noe! - Hey. Did I get him? - You died. The stone saved you. - I don't understand. - It doesn't have any power left. It doesn't have any power remaining, but I think this is how Sebek is able to regenerate his life force. - We have to stop Sebek from completing the ritual. - Yeah, come on. - Pull up. Pull up. Pull up! - On your back. Prepare for... - Don't move. - Sager. We have to stop Sebek from completing the ritual. - You just don't get it, do you? You are the ritual. - What are you talking about? - The stone was filled with Sebek's life force. Without it... Sebek can't complete the ritual. Sebek is alive. His power can be gained by another. I shall have everlasting power. - Hold on, Noe. Shit. - What do you want me to do with him? - Bring him. He'll be useful where we're going. Hello, little friend.
