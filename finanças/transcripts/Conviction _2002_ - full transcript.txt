They're holding 459 suspects... Wake up, Kansas City. Did you know there's a street gang summit in your town today? That's right, Christians! Satan's in town and he's brought his minions with him! This was day was foretold in Rev... Over the years I've developed a theory based on the concept of "nigger." What a nigger is... what makes a nigger... ...and, most important how to stop being a nigger. Go tell that nigger to quit honking that horn. No, fuck that nigger. Make him wait. Stop honking that horn, crazy motherfucker! Don't be running down to Gramma Gomere's asking for something to eat. I won't. Eat them crackers I left in there. I'm coming! I find out your little trouble-making butt left this house tonight I'll let them take you this time. I swear to God I will. I never saw myself as underprivileged. South Street Philadelphia was full of life. And at night... I couldn't resist. The color, the music... Hey. ...the people. ...with his tongue halfway down her throat! Hey, baby, hop in. How you doing? Mighty fine... damn! Kiss me! No, that's all right. "Oh, thank you," she whispered. "You will have my love and the Queen's grate... grate..." Gratitude. Carl! Keep quiet, Carl. Go on, Cynthia. "...the Queen's... "gratitude if you help us." "'Just tell me how I may serve you,' said D-D..." D'Artagnan. Carl, what's the matter with you? Don't you understand English? In the corner. Now. You have something to say for yourself? I was just trying to help. I'd say you have enough of your own problems, wouldn't you? What's this yellow you put in the flag? We ran out of white paint. You realize how dumb that is? You don't put yellow in the American flag! Yellow is the color of cowards! Stop that. You go home now. And you keep your mouth shut unless I ask you to open it. Is that clear? My thesis on niggers is based on my own life and, unfortunately, the lives of far too many people. In my terms, niggers are made, not born. I believe a baby shows up "tabula rasa," clean slate. Sometimes the immediate conditions can be so bad you'd say they were born niggers but I believe the process takes place after they've been infected by their surroundings and circumstances. I don't think deep down I've ever equated all black people with "niggers." Met a whole bunch of white niggers in my day as a matter of fact. When people grow up steeped in violence, ignorance neglect and oppression you have conditions for niggerhood... "Niggerization." Good job, boy. Thank you. Hey, wait a minute! Hey, it's an ugly word. I know it. But I'm talking about some ugly shit. And I'm all about getting un-niggerized. I'm gonna kick your motherfucking ass! Who's motherfucking ass, nigger, huh? Nigger, whose ass you gonna whip, huh, motherfucker? Huh? Whip whose motherfucking ass? Stay the fuck down! Stay down, motherfucking nigger! Stay down, motherfucker. I ought to cut that motherfucker. Yeah. Well, I be goddamned! Come here, boy. Bring your little ass over here! Hey, this is my boy. I got girls all over this motherfucking city but this is my only boy. He a good-looking little motherfucker, too, ain't he? That's right. Carl Upchurch. Hey, nigger's smart, too. What that say? "South Street Liquor." South Street Liquor. I'll be goddamned! Motherfucker... Stay down, nigger! What'd he do? What'd he do? Motherfucker pissed me off. Look, boy, don't let a nigger get up on you. See, don't let a nigger get up on you. Keep his... keep his ass off you. You know, beat that motherfucker down before he beats you down. You understand? You can't be weak. You hear me? You can't be weak. And good to see your little ass. Come on, let's go back in there. Yeah. Hey! True to form and expectations I grew to become another example. This ball's coming home with me, man. Fuck it! No one gets it! No, Fish! What are you doing? Are you nuts? I was basically ignorant, violent and blind to the fact that there was a whole nother way to live life. Hey. Shut up, motherfucker! I'm very sorry, Mrs. Fisher. Ma'am, we need you to come downtown with us to identify the body. Please. Oh, my God...! I'm so sorry. Fuck it! No one gets it! No, Fish! You must be crazy! Are you nuts? We're sorry, Mrs. Fisher. Oh, God... oh, God! We've got to find them niggers who killed him. I know the nigger went down swinging, man. Hey. Police telling people Tookie and them Clymer boys did it. You know, I think they put the word out because they want us to do them niggers, you know? Save them the trouble. Ain't you going in? No. He was stupid being out there alone. You can't let a nigger get up on you like that, man. So what are we gonna do? Hey, batter... Bitch! Get the fuck out of here! Go! Leave! You baseball bitch! You like baseball? Kill my boy? Stab this motherfucker, Bo! Stab him! He killed Fish! Kill this motherfucker! Motherfucker! Most everybody wants to be respected for something. And among men, if you kick ass everybody knows not to fuck with you You get plenty of respect. That shit's universal. I mean, if Bill Gates is in a dark alley about to get his ass kicked who do you think he wants next to him? His buddy Warren Buffett or the baddest motherfucker in town? Billy, Billy, Billy. Church... You dealin' coke on my block and shit? No. Callin' me out my name behind my back? What's that he called me again? Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah... dumb nigger. Motherfucker... don't do that shit with me. You shut the fuck up. Find the shit, nigger! What the fuck you waitin' for? Cover your ass up! Shut up, Billy. I'm just a dumb nigger with a prison GED... but you a fuckin' college graduate, Billy. You're supposed to know better. All right, we got it. Yeah. Who's the dumb nigger now, huh, Billy? I was sailin', Jack. Inside, I'd learned to be a better criminal, a tougher motherfucker. Outside, I looked forward to putting my new knowledge to work. And if I got caught, no problem. I was only going back to school... and home. Upchurch, Carl. Bank robber. New arrival. New? Well, new here. Been all through the system. Nothing but trouble, so fuck him. Guess they figured they might as well segregate his ass right off the bat. How long? Who gives a shit? Get his monkey ass in there. We'll see how uncontrollable you are. How the fuck is that, huh? Leave him alone! Stupid fuckin' nigger. Welcome to Lewisburg. You're awake. Lewisburg? No, Martha's Vineyard. It's pretty, ain't it? Aw... what the hell do you expect? That's about the dumbest thing I ever saw. Aw, you done Seg before, ain't you? Know how I can tell? 'Cause you look like you're about half out your fuckin' mind. Nothing personal. I mean, 23-hour lockdown, hour on the yard. One motherfuckin' shower a week. A motherfucker gets stinky and goofy. Yeah... You know how to read? Lordy, shut the fuck up, white boy. Nigger can talk! : Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Ain't that some shit. I was just being neighborly, chitlin. Lettin' you know the deal down here. Shut the fuck up! You see, here in Segregation we got first crack at the library books, only most motherfuckers in Seg, they don't know how to read them. Maybe comic books or magazines with girlie pictures in them. The dumbest motherfuckers' only privilege is first crack at the library books. Ain't that some cruel funny shit? Oh, you're gonna be a fun neighbor. Peters! Peters, what you got to stick all the dumb-ass no-conversation niggers next to me for? Why don't you shut your mouth you cracker piece of shit? I'll tell you what-- you don't call me a cracker piece of shit... or a honky or a redneck... and I won't call you a nigger. I tell you what, you cracker piece of shit honky, redneck, white boy, inbred motherfucker-- shut the fuck up! Aw, man, shut up! You might as well forget about that shit! There's cheese in the yellow box... it's all lumpy... so I said, "Bitch, this had better be some blue-box macaroni." You listening, Upchurch? Fuck this shit! You're the one that needs saving! Go to hell! Chap... Chap... Chap, Chap! Wait up, man! Did you file my grievance? You talk to the warden, man? Habeas corpus, motherfucker! Due process! You can't throw me in Segregation for no reason! Peters! Hey, Peters! Peters, you motherfucker! Is that you, Mr. Upchurch? How can I help you, sir? Here, man! Get me some new food, man. How am I supposed to live on that shit? I take it you won't be joining us for supper tonight. You know what else, man? Get me something new to read, goddamn it. This shit is old! Sports? I told you to try the fucking comics. I think we'll hold off on the magazines awhile. Anything else? Fuck you! Fuck all of y'all! Shit, man! Being locked down in Segregation... I couldn't even get into a good fight... except with words. What the fuck is this shit? Shakespeare?! Which kept the guy next to me sane, but drove me crazy. Fuck! Yeah! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Don't hurt yourself, boy. About fucking time, you cracker motherfucker. Hey, man, I got something, don't I? Yard time. Fuck off, Peters. It's your time. Hey, could you tell me what's my time, motherfucker? "Thee... Thou hast refusest..." What the fuck is this shit? "When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes, "I, all alone... be... beweep my outcast state." Yeah, man, "outcast." Yeah, fuck all of y'all! What? Shut up, Upchurch! Fuck you! All done down here. "Sonnet 29." 29... 29... "When in disgrace... ...with Fortune and men's eyes, I, all alone, beweep my outcast state." Goddamn. "Desiring this man's art, and that man's scope With what I most enjoy, contented least..." "Yet, in these thoughts, myself..." "...myself almost despising." Say, man... what's a lark? I think it's a Buick. No, the bird, motherfucker. What kind of a bird is a lark? Shit. Stupid motherfucker. A dictionary, motherfucker. Get the fuck out of here. Lark... lark... lark... lark... lark... "A singing bird. Ground-living; meadowlark..." "Like to the lark at break of day arising from sullen earth." "Like to the lark at break of day, arising"... Here it is. As you requested. : Look at Shakespeare. Whoo. I'm gonna beat your ass to death, Ledford! Whoo-hoo-hoo, what's the matter, Upchurch? You ashamed or something? Wait'll y'all hear this. It seems that the good old chaplain ain't down here trying to save Upchurch's soul. Oh, no, sir! The two lovebirds are down here reading Shakespeare together. Shakespeare taking it in the rear. And Upchurch is giving it to him. I'm gonna kill you, no matter how long it takes, Ledford! You're already killing me, Upchurch. I'm dying of laughter here, you bookworm motherfucker! Shut up, motherfuckers! Shut up! Hey, Church... you read that shit for real? You fuck off, T-Bone, or I'll kill your big ass next. Fuck you and Shakespeare! I said shut the fuck up! Straight up, man. Read us some. Hey, Shakespeare's a queer. I said shut the fuck up! Now you trippin', big nigger. I really want to hear this. Yeah, all right. This is a poem called "Sonnet 29." "When in disgrace with Fortune and men's eyes "I, all alone, beweep my outcast state "And trouble deaf heaven with my bootless cries "And look upon myself and curse my fate... "Wishing me like to one more rich in hope "Featured like him "Like him with friends possessed "Desiring this man's art and that man's scope With what I most enjoy, contented least..." The party's over, Upchurch. Shit! Fuck you! Damn it, I was almost asleep! "Yet, in these thoughts "my self almost despising "Haply I think on thee "and then my state "Like to the lark, at break of day, arising "from sullen earth "sings hymns at heaven's gate. "For thy sweet love remembered, such wealth brings That then I scorn to change my state with kings." Damn, Church. Hey, Upchurch... read that part about her titties again 'fore I go. Say, fuck you, Ledford. A little knowledge wouldn't hurt your ignorant ass you comic-book-reading, corn-fed redneck. Damn, Church you say the woman's a sister? How you know that? It's right there, Jerome. "If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun." I already told you dun means brown. "If hair be wires, then black wires grow on her head." Man, brown breasts and wiry hair-- you tell me what color that stuff is. Sounds like brown sugar to me. You just keep on reading about them titties, Upchurch. You keep on dreaming about 'em, Jerome 'cause old Ledford here he's going to go out and find himself some real ones. Knock off a piece for me. We'll see you soon, white trash. They say "knowledge is power." Absolutely. Man gets ahold of the right idea, it can inspire him to change his life. Or at least help him figure out why things are so fucked up. What you looking at, fuck-face? Shh. Third period, literature. "...the more glorious the triumph "And it would be strange indeed "if so celestial an article as Freedom should not be highly rated." Gather your personals. You're out of segregation. What, a year in here isn't long enough? Lucky for me, somewhere back in my childhood I learned to like reading in spite of all the other bullshit. When I stumbled on it this time, it saved my life. I gained power from the African-American writers of the 1920s, the Harlem Renaissance, contemporary black writers... Baldwin, Angelou, Charles Johnson, Charles Gordone. You know, jack some stuff, make some bread. Be nice to say I never revisited old habits. But I did. What the fuck you doing? Huh? Motherfucker! What the fuck you... What the fuck you talking about? Motherfucker! For the first time in my prison life, I felt remorse. It hit me hard that I piped a man over basically nothing. He almost died. Eggs for a Mafia nigger. I was acting exactly as I was expected to act... as a lowdown, ignorant, nigger criminal. I knew I didn't want to be that anymore. Upchurch, hold it. Whatever you've done, I don't want to know and you don't want to tell me. Not today anyway. ...and so it is the conclusion of this board that, pending parole... you be released to a halfway house facility. Congratulations, Mr. Upchurch. To which locality do you wish to report? Philadelphia. In my cell, I had the solitude to study and think and picture a life for myself. Back on the streets, reality was nobody wanted to hire an ex-con with no real skills. To make matters worse I made the same damn mistake a lot of ex-cons make. I went to my old environment, without a solid plan. Shit, man, they make you wait six months for a job training program. Man, look, you listen to Bo now. You ain't no minimum-wage nigger. What you need is a score, get you back on your feet. I'm ready. You ready for some hard prison time, Bo? Hmm, prison. Hey, look, man, I'm just trying to get out this motherfucker and live straight. Nigger, you fuck up my hide. Nigger, you can't do straight. I mean, shit... Motherfucker, look, that's like my skinny ass flying. Look, man, this your shit right here. South Street. You the king. King, motherfucker. Shit, man, who you talking to? Here... here. Welcome home, brother. Help me out, man. Got a quarter? What the fuck is this? Shit. That's right, old man. That's exactly right. Put the money in the bag, bitch or I'll blow your fucking head off. Hurry up. Hurry up, bitch, this ain't no joke! Move! Move, move, move, move, move! Shit! Pull over, Bo. I can lose these motherfuckers! Fuck it, man. Fuck, man. We ain't going to make it, man, pull over! No way! I can't do time, man! I can't do time! Watch out, watch out! Oh, shit! Oh! Ah! Motherfuckers better straighten that line. I'm going to talk to you, brother. About a proposition. Damn. Carl Upchurch. I heard you got out. Yeah, me too. Ain't this a bitch. When'd you learn to read, Dumbo? Read? Hell, I'm doing college. Shit, you jiving, man! Oh, yeah, well, the judge suggested I improve my prospects. There wasn't no future in investing beer money in biker bars selling coke to narcs. How? A GED and a grant. Beats the hell out of a shitty job like this. Check it out, bubba. Shakespeare. Come on. First thing we're gonna to do is lay some bread down get that motherfucker transferred over. Then when he get here we gonna go ahead and snatch his whole operation. Just take it, huh? Oh, yeah, that's where you come in. Word is you're very convincing. You want me to dust him. All I'm saying is don't nobody give a shit about a dead nigger dope dealer. Plus you can get up on him because you don't belong to nobody. ...'cause Shakespeare... is a horny motherfucker. Look, man, we can control all the shit coming in here, you know what I'm talking about? Smack... reefer... Blow. My boys got your back. So what you saying, lone wolf? You in or what? Why couldn't God have created the Big Bang? What is this Sunday School bullshit? Supposed to be Physics class. My point is... Carl... that even scientists need to keep an open mind. Why do science and religion have to conflict? Uh, Mrs. Conamacher, I believe that you're too smart to believe in all that Virgin Mary, Jesus, walking-on-water crap. Yes, but isn't that exactly what faith is about, Carl? Belief in a truth that cannot be explained. I can explain Christianity. It's bullshit. Amen. You got your white Virgin Mary, you got your white Jesus. It's a white man's tool for making brown people slaves. Always has been. That's right. First of all, Jesus and Mary were not Caucasian, Carl. And if you think it's just a white man's religion... You know what? I'm going to bring in some books to show you. I would be very interested in your reaction. At first glance, Martha Conamacher seemed like so many of the teachers I had known, and I wanted to dismiss her as just another self-righteous bully with a book. But something in her eyes was different. She was... there. And I was never one to back down from a challenge. Africa. Damn. Don't forget that paper, Christian. I read your books. All of them? And? And, uh... I was wrong about some shit. You can't be wrong about something you didn't know. You could be ignorant. Hey, hey, don't be calling me ignorant. Ignorant just means that you weren't aware. Oh, but I'm very aware of the quote-unquote "white" Christianity that comes from the Christianity I just learned was rooted in Africa. I'm also very aware... ...that the white version was used as a tool to conquer. It's like they sent the clergy in to soften them up. Then they sent the army in to beat them up. Then they let the clergy back loose on them to keep them humble and well-behaved. That white version was used big time to keep the slaves in line. Of course, that's coming from my "ignorant" perspective. You make good points. I can tell we're going to have very challenging discussions. I look forward to it. See you next week. Wait. Hold on. I ain't finished talking this week. The Society of Friends is another name for Quakers. You're a Quaker? No, no, no. The Amish are the bonnet and buggy people. We Quakers are very sneaky. We go around looking just like everybody else. I suppose what distinguishes Quakers is we believe that there's a divinity-- a piece of God-- in all of us. We call it "the light within." : Shit. Mrs. Conamacher, you believe that there's a light within these mother... these convicts? Yeah, I do. Shit. Well, I'll tell you what. I see a lot of burnt-out bulbs around here myself. Well, I didn't say it was easy to find the divinity. Sometimes you got to find their humanity first. Church. Ledford. That your house? Yes, sir. I got to stop this shit, Carl. Some way, somehow, I got to. Yeah, me, too. Get back! Come on! Come on! That's it! Hey, motherfucker! What, punk? You better cut that shit. Get him, Church! Put it on him now! Yeah, you're right, brother. I charged you. No basket. Oh, you gonna let him get away with that, dawg? What the fuck y'all looking at? Come on. All right, let's go. Martha, I'm only alive because everybody knows what happens if you fuck with Church. Now, what's going to happen if I try to change the rules? Hmm? I've seen how men respect you here. They fear me. So? You might be the one man who can show them that the rules can change. That there's a better way to live. Maybe it's the light within you. There you go condescending again. No. I'm telling you the truth. Bullshit, Carl. It's bullshit. I don't care what Martha Cona-wanna-wacher says. A man's nature has a lot more to do with him ending up in here than his environment-- nurturing or not. You are what you are, bubba. Then why the hell are you even bothering to study for, then, Ledford? You're a walking example against your own argument. No, no. We are both a walking example for my argument. You and I are here because of our criminal natures. The only difference is I refuse to blame that shit on anything but what I am. You are a nigger, man. What? You've been taught that it's your nature to end up in jail and you've accepted it. That is niggerization. You been niggerized, my man. Zap! Ledford's a nigger now. But, see, you're trying to nurture yourself. Therefore, you're trying to get "de-niggerized," and that's really all the fuck I'm talking about. You know damn well these motherfuckers would have ended up assholes no matter where they grew up-- niggers and whites. Yeah, but I bet you some of these motherfuckers would have been running Fortune 500 companies. Writers, lawyers, doctors. Who knows what they'd have been if they wouldn't have been niggerized and just remained assholes? What the hell are you talking about, Carl? In a nurturing environment with a good education I bet you, from the git half of these motherfuckers wouldn't even be here-- white niggers and black niggers. Motherfucker, quit calling me a nigger! You're niggerized, so you're a nigger, man. You and that new teacher friend of yours got your heads so far up your fucking asses... This is a thesis I'm working on. It's fucking stupid. Well, you're a dumb nigger and you don't know it. Kill him, Church! Shut up, nigger! Hey, asshole! We're talking. Y'all clear out before we get busted. Beat it! Beat it! Yo, back off! Just talking. It's cool. No fight. Dumb niggers. You had enough? And so it is... ...with great pride that I present the Bachelor of Science and Arts graduates for 1981. Whoa! All right! Whoa! Yeah, Daddy! Graduate school? It's a Quaker college in Indiana and the dean's a friend of mine. He can arrange a scholarship for you. I don't think so. Keep it. Carl... I want you to know how proud I am of you. Thanks. What the hell is wrong with you? You got a hearing next month. I always fuck up on the outside. You see, it's in my nature to try to cop the big score. Listen. Let's not ever meet back here again. Ever. No excuses like, "It's in my nature," either, you punk. Kiss my ass, lifer. You just try not to come back here before I get out. You can go. I got to use the phone. Carl, watch out! Whoa! Hey! Whoa! What's his problem? He's a mean one. Really mean. Uh-huh. Come on, let's go. We'll get some coffee. Hey, hey, hey! Whoa! We want you to know, Carl that you can stay here as long as you need to. Yeah, we could use your help around the farm. We adopted the boys when they were babies. I'm afraid William's had an easier time of it than Demetrius. You know, you're probably the first adult black man they've been around. Martha, Bob, I'm no role model. You don't have to perform. Just be yourself. Hey, Jim. Morning, Martha. Is everything all right? Yeah, just passing by. Everybody okay here? Yeah, we're great. Uh, Carl Upchurch, I'd like you to meet Sheriff Stark. Morning, Sheriff. Upchurch, yeah, I heard about you. You related to the boys? Which boys? Carl's helping out on the farm. That's nice. How's... how's Mary Beth? Oh, she's fine... fine, thank you. Good. Well, give her my best, will you? Yeah, you bet I will, mm-hmm. I'm gonna, uh, heat this up. Would you like a cup of coffee, Sheriff? No, thank you. You make that? Is that what you do here, Carl, you cook? And pick the cotton. Martha, have you seen his record? I know everything I need to know, Jim. Do you? Do you know how many calls we've gotten since he got here? We have had two calls from his parole officer. We got another call from Philadelphia PD for God's sakes, "just checking in." This man is beyond rehabilitation. He needs to be watched very, very carefully. You have children here. I know everything I need to know. You have a nice day. So this is where you're always sneaking off to? Don't tell anyone about this place. It's your spot? Where's William? He likes to hang out with his buddies. I like to come here and watch the river. It's a nice spot. Did you like robbing banks? I guess I did, in a way. It was the only way I knew how to get money. Now I know better. So you ain't gonna rob and steal no more? "Anymore." And no, I don't expect to be robbing and stealing. Of course we won't talk about the robbing and stealing that created some of those banks. That's another conversation when you're older, young brother. I'll put it to you this way-- the black folks didn't start here and the Indians didn't start out on the reservation. Man, let's keep it simple for now. Let's enjoy this fine day we got here. Let's catch us some fish. I'm hungry. Is this right? Try again. ...Democrats on Capitol Hill are vowing to fight the tax package despite the poll's results. And turning to our cities the FBI reports a sharp rise in violent crime especially among inner city blacks. Black-on-black crime, much of it in the form of youth gang violence, leads all categories. A Reagan Administration spokesman blamed lenient courts and called for harsher sentencing guidelines. I'm ready. How's the quiche? Hmm? The what? The quiche... The quiche. It's cool for quiche. Aparth... Apartheid. Is that a disease or something? No, it's a government policy in South Africa. Legal segregation and oppression. A small white minority rules a huge majority black population by force. Uh, yeah, a couple years ago some kids did a protest thing about that. Something about Earlham giving money to some apartheid country? One of those countries in South Africa. South Africa is the country of apartheid. What did you say about the protest again? Uh, I forget-- some business thing. Investments maybe? I don't know, I wasn't really into it. Hey, Carl I hope you don't mind but there's this rumor floating around that you spent some time in prison. God! What's it like? Tracy...! I've got to go. What? I'm dying to know. "...one of those countries in South Africa..." Jerk. Damn. Well, I have nothing to do with this. The Board of Trustees invests Earlham's endowment fund. Investing in companies that profit in South Africa! You're financing apartheid! Now, that's... that's a little strong, Carl. These corporations are multinational. They profit all over the world not just South Africa. No one here is condoning apartheid. No, you're just making money off of it! Now, please, Carl, please... The Board meets in three months. I'll pass your objections along. Beyond that, there's really nothing I can do. Man... Leave? You've only been there a few weeks. Martha, I can't stay here. These people are hypocrites. We can hold hands, we can pray, we can discuss and we can finance oppression. Well, it sounds to me like somebody needs to speak up. Damn it, Martha, what am I supposed to do? You think these people give a damn what I think? You know what they're doing right now? Mom, is that Carl? Wait-Wait a minute. Demetrius wants to say hi. Martha, wait... You know, he's doing so much better in school. I think you really helped him. I'm going to let him tell you-- hold on. Martha, wait... Hey! Hey, beat it! Hey, get out of here! Sorry! Hi, Carl. Hey, little brother. My mom... my mom said you were leaving school. Leaving school? Your mom, she's funny, you know? No, man, I'm just here learning stuff just like you. But you hate it? Well, it's fun. It's cool. Would I like it? Actually... ...you'd love it. You'd fit right in. What's so funny? Nothing. Mom says I have to get off the phone. All right, brother. Will you call me on the weekend? All right, I'll give you a call on Saturday. Okay. All right. Bye. Bye. Are you all right? Yeah, I'm fine. : Are you sure? Yeah, I got it. Pledge week. Are you pledging? Yeah, right. Gamma Kappa Rasta Fari. How about I help you? Rescue you? How about that? That would be nice. I'm Andrea Santoni. Carl Upchurch. Nice to meet you. Nice to meet you. So, I'm headed this way. What are they feeding these kids? There are just too many children that grow up in this country homeless-- in poverty and in pain, and we need to reach them before their spirits are completely broken. Sor... I'm sorry. I tend to get a little worked up. What do you really know about the city? What do you know about apartheid? What are you doing talking to me? You're not the first black man I've ever had a conversation with, okay? And I know about a lot of things. My father wrote a book about Malcolm X. Really? Yeah, really. Wow. Let me ask you something. Hmm? Have you ever seen this? Earlham finances apartheid. Apartheid isn't just some policy practiced by evil men 10,000 miles away. As long as Earlham College money helps fuel corporations that sustain South Africa's economy the source of apartheid is right here, right now! And you are all responsible. You. You. You. You. You and me! Millions-- millions of African deaths are on our heads! How can we live with that? Whoo! Right on! I never got this much attention without a gun in my hand. When Martha suggested I lead, I'm not sure a protest at her Quaker college is what she had in mind. It's not what I had in mind either. But it sure felt good serving something right. Definitely right... for the first time in my life. So, what are you guys trying to do here? Oh, uh... We've been working really hard, uh... just trying to right the wrongs in the world, I guess. And how's it going? Um, it's been going pretty good. Uh, people... people are reacting. Did you call me here to threaten me? Of course not. That's bullshit. I made my living making threats, remember? But if the college loses profits, scholarships like yours are the first things they cut. That's not a threat? I just don't want to see a bright future like yours sacrificed... Cut the bullshit, Professor Wise. Who's pulling your strings? Did the dean send you down here to talk to me or something? Carl, as your friend I thought you should know how things worked. A friend? We don't even fucking know each other. You can't shut me up with a scholarship, either! You can take your fucking scholarship... Carl! ...and shove it up your fucking ass! Carl... There are better ways to do this. You better decide which world you want to live in, okay? 'Cause in this world that tough-guy routine of yours isn't going to get you anywhere. This isn't South Street. Look, you don't know shit about me. I'm just the loud celebrity nigger around here. "Carl is our very own black activist." Been to jail and everything. Let him yell about the injustice while we feel better about ourselves. So this is about you, and how you come off? Andrea, what Board of Trustees is going to let a bank robber tell them what to do with their money? So you're going to quit? I'm the one that's up there looking like a fucking fool! Fuck this shit. Miss Santoni. Mr. Upchurch. Shall we enter and "politely" convey our concerns? Let's kick some ass. The trustees are waiting. Congratulations. Thanks. Hey, Carl, what are you doing tonight? Hey, I'm, uh... studying. Congratulations, Mr. Upchurch. Well done. Thank you. Excuse me for a second? Sure. Hey. Hey. We got them. We sure did. Did I ever thank you for getting up in my face? Yeah, I guess I was kind of hard on you. You know, um... you're the only one here that I trust. Sorry. It's the champagne. Should I get another glass? Your props are like your reputation. Your identity, you know? Where you've been, what you've done. Who you've jacked. You mean resumé. Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Something like that. So you got to have props. A man with no props is insignificant. He has no voice. But a man with big props-- that means he's been challenged, you know? He's taken risks, and he's survived so he's got respect. Well, you got your props today, Mr. Upchurch. Yeah, but so what? In the scheme of things... I called Martha today to tell her I was coming home to say good-bye. What? I've been hiding out long enough. A master's degree is just not going to help me with what I got to do. And what's that? I'm not sure yet. What? Moving on would be harder than I thought for a whole bunch of reasons. Before going back to Martha's, I went home to Philly even though I knew I wasn't supposed to. I had to go back, look around, try to find my mission only to discover that the world was changing. The revolutionaries were dying off. The gangsters were taking over. Come back here! Who's that? Oh, that's a friend of mine. Andrea? It's Andrea. Is that your girlfriend? No. It's his girlfriend! It's not my girlfriend. Wait a minute! Hey, fellas, hold on. Boys... hold up! Hold on, fellas. Hold on. Boys! What a greeting! Are you his girlfriend? Yeah, do you guys kiss? Hey. "Hey." Oh, all right. All right, all right. Say good-bye to Andrea, fellas. Good-bye. Bye. Andrea Santoni. Martha Conamacher. Hi. I've heard so much about you. Oh, it's very nice to meet you, too. I'm sorry to just drop in, but I woke up this morning. I kind of missed you, so I thought... it's a good day for a drive. Well, make yourself at home and, please, stay as long as you like. Thank you. This is... It's so beautiful. Sure is. Sure is. She invited you to stay. Yeah. Did she mean it? Uh... I don't think she meant it in that way. Mmm... Mmm... I have to go anyway. I have that final tomorrow. I have one absentee coming to me. Yeah, she didn't mean it. Not that way. She's... a Quaker. She's a Quaker. Hey. Hey. Thanks. How come she didn't spend the night? She had tests. She's Episcopalian. : Oh. She's very pretty. Yeah. And smart. Think she's too young for me? Do you? I got a lot of unfinished business. You got out, Carl. Nobody would blame you if you never went back to Philadelphia. There's a lot of decent folk back home, you know just trying to make things better. I just want to help them. Just be careful. Saving the world is a tough business. Compared to what? That's good. It is now. Morning. This is outrageous, Jim. He hasn't done anything. I want an explanation now! They're coming up here to ask Mr. Upchurch some questions about his involvement in a terrorist organization called MOVE. MOVE is a religious organization. Oh. I guess that's why the Philadelphia Police Department bombed them because they're looking for Jesus? Your name was found in a phone book of a woman who died in that bombing. So that makes him guilty of a crime? I'm not saying that, but I'll tell you one thing: If he leaves his assigned area without permission from his parole officer, he goes back to prison. You been to South Philly lately? Wait, wait, wait, wait! You are going to put him back in prison based on a technicality? No! No, I will not let you! This will not stand! Mouth open, tongue out. Side to side. Lift your balls. Side to side. Turn around. Bend over. Spread your cheeks. Hey, bitch. What the fuck you doing?! That ain't your place! Talking all that shit... ...motherfucker! Come on, man! You don't want to fuck with me. Beat that motherfucker! Hey! Come on, move! It's overcrowded... understaffed. No recreation. No job training. No education. Yeah, I know it's prison... but it ain't right to treat men like animals and then punish them when they don't act human. Yeah, listen to me. Listen, you don't have to keep coming here. They got me for another 12 months. Okay, so I'll know right where to find you. Among another generation. The sons of my brothers. But they've got one thing going for them: You. I tell you, baby. You'd better leave before I try to break out of here. "The... "cat is... b-black and-and fat." Yes. Yes, brother, you're reading. It's that simple. Now, see, Jean Valjean's thing is "Look, I'm always going to be the punk that did that crime "but I claim responsibility for it. "And I'm also a man and I claim the right to change my life." You see what I'm saying? Hey, bitch. Now, I just know you ain't fucking with my boys talking some shit about reading some book that's going to change their world. You don't want your boys to read? Motherfucker fairy tale about some better life? That don't do shit but make them soft. Then what? Then they dead. You understand? Nigger's crew is all they got in this world, homeboy. My crew about as strong as they need to be. I'm just here to make sure they stay that way, So, you do me a favor-- just stay the fuck out of the way... nigger. Yeah, I know where you're coming from, brother. You don't know shit, bitch. Yeah, I know South Street, South Philly. Glen Mills, Milan, Terra Haute Atlanta, Western, Petersburg, Lewisburg, Memphis. So, you been locked up. If you ain't noticed ain't nary a nigger in here free. Look, brother, I understand where you're coming from. I wouldn't fuck with you and your boys. All's I'm saying is a little knowledge don't make a man soft. It make a man smart. Smart? Yeah? So what you doing here, nigger? Guess I'm supposed to be here right now, brother. Mm-hmm. And I'm here for any man from any crew who wants to talk... listen or read. See, now I'm gonna have to fuck you up. No, brother, all you got to do is serve your time. I'll kill you, motherfucker! Cut his throat! No more! No more. Move! Move! I was finally free. No more parole. I could go anywhere, and I did-- to places I never dreamed possible. Come to bed? In a minute. Shut the fuck up! Shut the fuck up! Bitching about how bad prison is. It's prison, goddamn it! I'm up in this motherfucker forever! Ain't no job training going to help me. I got a brother out there, banging, dropping out 'cause he wants to be like me. Like me-- ain't that some fucked-up shit? So you tell me, Mr. Smart Nigger, you tell me what the fuck you're going to do about the brothers and the babies on the streets, huh? Wake up, is that the sun? Thanks. When the Rodney King verdict came in from Simi Valley, Los Angeles police went on full alert but no one could have predicted the magnitude of the unrest. So far, there are 20 confirmed deaths and fires are raging out of control all over South Central Los Angeles tonight. I went to my church to ask for help. I had to get to L.A., no matter what. And they raised enough money to send me. I walked the streets of L.A. for 30 days. I talked to teenage mothers, cops, old folks and gangsters. Everybody was in a daze, including me. I didn't know what I was looking for. There were no ready answers. When more than a thousand people are killed in one place in one year the U.N. defines it as a war zone. L.A. County was a war zone. So... What you planning, big man? What? I know you. I know when something's up. Yeah. It's pretty crazy. Hmm? It's real crazy. I just need a name. Good morning, this is Carl Upchurch of the Council for Urban Peace and Justice. Yes. I think it's time for action. If we can get them to come together from across the country... The real danger is if we don't try... Stop the killing... Save children's lives... We need money, of course... Do you know someone I could go to? Any help will do... Thank you for your time. What? You will? Hello? Is Carl Upchurch available? Yes, he is. Does he work there? Is this his office? Yes, he does. This is Reverend Mac Charles Jones from Saint Stephen's in Kansas City. Can you hold on just one moment? And I'll see if he's available. Sure. Thanks. Babe, it's a Reverend Mac Charles Jones from Kansas City. Okay. Want Bunny? Bunny? Reverend? Are you for real? Oh, yes, I am. Kansas City work for you? No, it's-it's perfect. It's right in the middle of the country. We would love to have you here on that date. April 29. Yeah, that's the... Anniversary of the verdict. Right. It's a date, brother. You're a brave man, Carl Upchurch. Thank you, thank you so much. The world needs to know about this. Have you hired a publicist? No, I haven't done that yet, but... Brother, could you tell me how to set up a press conference? A gang summit? An urban peace and justice summit in Kansas City. Gang leaders from all over America will be invited... These are the people influencing our communities, expressing themselves with the language of the forgotten poor-- violence. We can keep ignoring and jailing them or we can listen, try to help shape tomorrow's leaders. Aren't you worried what will happen if you bring these people together? Aren't you worried what will happen if we don't? How can you possibly bring rival gangs together peacefully? I'll ask them. You tripping, motherfucker. You crazy, nigger? Meet with them? You're out of your fucking mind. Get the fuck out of here. You don't represent no gang. You with the police, right? The FBI, CIA? No, brother. Who you pimping for? Jesse? Farrakhan? CNN? The Council for Urban Peace and Justice. What the fuck is that? It's me. Nigger, please. "Me"? Brother, we got an organization that's been around since Martin. With influence and respect. That's why we asked you to stop by. We're a little concerned with your lack of experience. Something like this is bigger than you. We'll do it right. Nightly news, Sunday talk shows. By the time we're through the whole world will know what we're talking about. But when? This can't wait. The perfect time, brother-- right before the next election. Go home, Carl. We'll do this thing right. I can't believe it's these old-school, civil rights sanctified motherfuckers trying to kill this thing because they didn't think of it... because it's not their idea. It's all about ego and spin. I'm starting to think shit, maybe they're right. Maybe I'm the crazy one. Maybe this thing is not going to fly. What? Nothing. I know you got something to say. "Keep going, Carl. All good causes, Carl." I hate it when you do this. No, you don't. Yeah, I do. Nah, I ain't here to bullshit you, man. Shit, I don't know what you know. Shit, I'm old school. Man, I'm a dinosaur... but I know one thing. This shit must stop: bullets flying, your babies dying, your mothers crying. This is your home. That's your babies out there on the street. The whole world is watching. All they see is the MTV version of you. "Yo, yo, yo, what's up, my nigger? "Yo, fuck the police. Yo, come here, bitch. Be my ho." Let me tell you something, brother. I look into your eyes, I see much more than that. I see men. I see survivors. You're at war trying to stake a claim and the casualties around you are getting bigger than the upside. Brothers, all I'm saying is look into the eyes of the man on the other end of your gun. Does he want what you want? Does he look like you? Just stop... for one weekend. One weekend. Hold a conversation. You show this world who you really are. Straight up? You guarantee our safety? Wake up, Kansas City. Did you know there's a street gang summit in your town today? That's right, Christians. Satan's in town and he's brought his minions with him. This day was foretold in... I'll be out in a second. Saw your light. You cool? You been out here all night? The Nation says, "Stay with the man" I stay with the man. Let me ask you something. You guard many non-Muslims? I go where the Minister sends me. Why does the Minister think that I need a bodyguard? Maybe you haven't heard. Folks out here think you're either crazy or dangerous. I've heard. You think I'm crazy? I'm here to protect you, Brother Carl not to think. Give me about an hour. I got your back. Come in. Any new arrivals? No. Shit. You need to see this. Kansas City Crips pulled out last night. Oh, this is great. You tell everyone we're failing and scare the city half to death while you're at it. If we can't even get the local gangs, we're illegitimate. We need them all here. What more can you do? I can get back on that damn phone that's what I can do. Let's just go. You know the less brothers show, the less likely somebody gets hurt. He just wants to make sure you're down with the thing. Yo, nigger this shit ain't gonna fly. It's cool. What's the problem, young brother? I'll tell you what my fucking problem is, nigger. How the fuck you got me come all this way you put me in a room with two motherfucking beds, nigger? Who the fuck you think we are? As you can see we're a little filled up right now, brother. There's a lot of brothers here. A cot is just going to have to do. Yo, my man, don't be talking about no cot. Yo, you gonna get us another bed right now or we gone. You know something? You're absolutely right, brother. You traveled a long way and you deserve to be well rested comfortable. You got a lot of hard work to do. I'll tell you what. Take my key. I'll have the front office clean it up at once. Where the hell you gonna sleep? Ain't about me, brother. Yo, hold up. I guess Li'l T can sleep on a cot. What the fuck? Nigger, shut the fuck up, man! All right? Cool. The media has been barred from the proceedings inside though organizers promise a press conference... Here at St. Stephen's Baptist Church where the self-styled urban gangsters have gathered for this, the first national meeting... The media has been barred from the proceedings inside though organizers promise a press conference after the summit's conclusion on Sunday. That's good. It's still early yet. I miss you, too, baby, more than you'll ever know. Tell my little girl I'll be home soon, okay? Give her a kiss for me. All right. Love you, too. What's wrong? Come see for yourself. We showed, brother. Thank you, brother. The history I have marks me as a blessed man. South Street was once the center of my universe. I could have vanished into the gravitational pull of that black hole, but with hard work and by the grace of God, I broke free. With the help of a few special people, I learned that I may not have been responsible for what I was, but I can be responsible for what I am and what I hope to become. If I could do it, so could countless others, but somebody has to tell them that. Somebody has to lift their eyes to a wider horizon. Somebody has to inspire hope within them. I'm Carl Upchurch. Peace.
