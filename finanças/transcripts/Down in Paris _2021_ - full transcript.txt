I know you will! ﻿Excuse me. ﻿When you’re ready. ﻿Can you take over? ﻿-I really need some air. -What? ﻿Can you shoot the scene? ﻿You sure? ﻿It’s a key scene, I don’t know if... ﻿I can’t go on. ﻿What’s all this? ﻿I can’t. Find someone else. ﻿What’re you saying? ﻿You chose wrongly. Simon will do a better job. ﻿You kidding? ﻿You’re just tired. I’ll pretend I didn’t hear that. ﻿I’m serious. ﻿You’re not, you’ve lost it. ﻿-What's left to do today? -Inserts. Patricia doesn’t have to stay. ﻿Can we do the scene tomorrow? ﻿Yes... I’ll make space for it. ﻿Perfect! ﻿We’ll do the scene tomorrow. ﻿Go home and rest. ﻿-Tomorrow won’t change anything! -Tomorrow’s another day! ﻿Take a break and Simon will finish today. ﻿Richard? ﻿You reckon? ﻿I’m the producer, I decide. ﻿Simon, I’m counting on you. ﻿No problem! ﻿Change of program everyone! ﻿Get going! See you tomorrow! ﻿- Good evening sir. - Good evening. ﻿What can I get you? ﻿-ZA whiskey please. -Awhiskey? Sure. ﻿Oh God. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you. ﻿Thank you. ﻿- Madame. - Thank you. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Thanks! ﻿Richard! ﻿Shit. ﻿Evening. ﻿You good? ﻿Yes, and you? ﻿-Yeah. -Great. ﻿We’re trying the new bar, Pink something... ﻿Mister Pink. ﻿Great name. ﻿Who cares? If it’s good. ﻿Want to join us? ﻿Are you kidding? ﻿ ﻿You off somewhere? ﻿Yes, I am. ﻿So, what’s new? ﻿Working on a new film? ﻿Yes. In the middle of a shoot. ﻿Brilliant! ﻿How’s it going? ﻿It’s going very well. ﻿Great news! ﻿Good. ﻿I must go. ﻿ ﻿Two minutes! ﻿It’s cool to see each other, eh? ﻿Not really. ﻿ ﻿Are you with someone else? ﻿Do you care? ﻿Have a good night. ﻿Hang on... Let me say goodbye! ﻿Yes? ﻿On our way ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Is the shoot going well? ﻿I’m under pressure. ﻿More than usual? ﻿Different this time. ﻿You OK? ﻿You look tired. ﻿Yes, but... ﻿Sometimes I wonder why I do it. ﻿We all do sometimes, eh? ﻿Perhaps. ﻿And you? ﻿You OK? ﻿Pretty good actually. ﻿I thought about you recently. ﻿Just got back from India! ﻿Brilliant! ﻿You liked it? ﻿Call me sometime, let’s talk about it... ﻿You can call me too, you know... ﻿Yes... But with Frederic, it’s not easy. ﻿Have you heard from Mathias? ﻿No, have you? ﻿-What were you talking about? -Mathias. ﻿He pissed everyone off, no one wants to see him! ﻿Don’t speak about him, please. ﻿I liked him. ﻿He was Richard’s best mate, not mine! ﻿Always round the flat... ﻿About the flat, I want my keys. ﻿What? Still on about that? ﻿I want them back. ﻿OK. If I find them. ﻿-Have you lost them? -No. ﻿I don’t give a fuck about them. ﻿-Of course... -Of course, what? ﻿..You don’t give a fuck. ﻿None of your dramas. ﻿Drama? ﻿-Always the same old shit. -What? ﻿Dramas, like in your films! ﻿-Don’t talk about my films! -Don’t worry, I won’t! ﻿Well, you’re an artist... ﻿And what are you? ﻿-Me? At least I’ve got a life! -But living off who, eh? ﻿You’re touchy because you’re single ﻿Now you’re really fucking me off! ﻿Stop it! ﻿Stop it! ﻿Fuck off! ﻿Cunt! ﻿Calm down! ﻿You OK? ﻿I can’t bear arguments. Can’t stand them. ﻿I’ve got an Uber coming. Drop you off? ﻿That’s kind. ﻿sorry. ﻿Here it is. ﻿Coming? ﻿I don’t know the background obviously, ﻿but you seemed in danger. ﻿Thank you. ﻿When I saw him, I... ﻿was everything to him. ﻿His nurse, his shrink, ﻿his cook. ﻿It was never enough. ﻿He bled me dry. ﻿Was it recent? ﻿Ended 5 months ago. ﻿It was like nothing had changed. ﻿Like going back in time. ﻿I once fought in the street with my ex. ﻿Nobody lifted a finger, ﻿luckily I got away. ﻿He gave up. ﻿He always found a reason to argue. ﻿It was always my fault. ﻿Finally, I had enough, ﻿I said I was leaving him. ﻿He lost it ﻿and tried to hit me. ﻿I got away ﻿and he followed me down the street. ﻿First time you’ve seen him since? ﻿ ﻿We ran into each other by chance. ﻿It’s still raw. ﻿Fighting doesn’t help. ﻿I need to turn over a new leaf. ﻿But I’m not succeeding. ﻿It took me a while too. ﻿What about changing the book? ﻿What? ﻿You know, new leaf, change the book... ﻿I find it hard to get rid of old books. ﻿Just drop me here. ﻿-Sorry, I wasn’t trying to... -No, no, it’s fine. ﻿Thank you. ﻿-Thank you very much. -You're welcome. ﻿Goodnight. ﻿It’s Maurice. You didn’t call. ﻿You must be home now. ﻿Have a drink and relax. We’re counting on you tomorrow. ﻿Simon noticed you’d left your script and notes. ﻿Just so you know. ﻿He’s got them. See you tomorrow! ﻿-Good evening. -Richard! Come in. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Let’s have a drink first. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Cheers! ﻿It really is urgent. ﻿Yes. Thanks for accepting. ﻿-You know how much I like you, Richard. -I know. ﻿When people are worried, they come to see me. ﻿I’d like to reassure them ﻿but I can’t always, ﻿I can’t lie. ﻿But they come for your truth. ﻿They may think ﻿but they’re not always ready to hear ﻿what I have to say. ﻿Let’s talk about you. ﻿How long has it been? ﻿-At least 6 months. -Yes, probably. ﻿Let’s see what we’ve got. ﻿Some good news: ﻿you left that man. ﻿Yes. ﻿I did warn you about him. ﻿Indeed. ﻿I ran into him in the street. ﻿Just now? ﻿Just before coming here... ﻿we fought. ﻿Everything is circular. ﻿Think of a dog. ﻿He doesn't walk straight, ﻿he sniffs, he snuffles about, ﻿he retraces his steps. ﻿Then suddenly he barks at a bird. ﻿It takes flight. ﻿Mostly, ﻿the bird stays out of reach. ﻿But it gives the dog something to follow. ﻿Gets him moving on. ﻿He's changed places. ﻿ ﻿You’re not barking yet, but you will. ﻿- I’ll continue. - Yes. ﻿You’ve lost someone recently, ﻿someone close, ﻿the bond of filiation. ﻿Yeah. ﻿My father... ﻿Shh! You know the rules. ﻿You’re on the cliff edge ﻿where your father just jumped. ﻿He wasn’t immortal. ﻿You’re holding your mother’s hand. ﻿Next time, it’s her, ﻿then it’s you. ﻿I know! ﻿You’ve just understood ﻿your mortality. ﻿You don’t yet know ﻿that your father is within you. ﻿Sorry. ﻿With you. ﻿You see him? ﻿No. I don't know how to do that. ﻿That's not my domain. ﻿Let's continue? ﻿Yes. ﻿I see a meeting, ﻿spectacular, ﻿it’s meant to be. ﻿A man, ﻿a handsome man. ﻿An artist perhaps. ﻿A prince, ﻿a king amongst men. ﻿It's good news. ﻿I’m happy for you, Richard. ﻿The session is over, ﻿I’ve seen what I had to see. ﻿Another glass? ﻿Yes! ﻿Thank you. ﻿I’ve just walked off set. ﻿ ﻿You’ve dropped everything? ﻿I don’t know. ﻿I don't know what to do next. ﻿Look within. The answer's inside you. ﻿You've shut the door too quickly. ﻿Reopen it. ﻿Close others. ﻿Let some air in. ﻿Take a step back, if necessary. ﻿ ﻿Look to the horizon. ﻿Come back and see me soon. ﻿You'll have things to tell ﻿Thank you so much, Samantha. Really. Thanks. ﻿I know my way out. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Sorry Maurice, I fell asleep. ﻿See you tomorrow. ﻿Goodnight. ﻿Are you here for the night of remembrance? ﻿I’m sorry? ﻿God never sleeps! ﻿Join us! ﻿-Good evening. -Good evening. ﻿There’s nobody here yet but the church is open all night. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Are you praying? ﻿Are you praying? ﻿I don’t know. Perhaps. ﻿I saw you and wondered why a handsome man ﻿would be in church at night. ﻿I’m here by chance. ﻿Chance can work wonders. ﻿I’m not here by chance. ﻿-I’m always in church. -At night? ﻿There’s no one about. ﻿It's calm. ﻿I watch. ﻿I listen. ﻿I hear souls speak. ﻿Lost souls mostly. ﻿Then I saw you. ﻿You walk with grace. ﻿Grace? ﻿There’s a sort of naivety about you. ﻿A fragility. ﻿So, I watched you. ﻿I observed you. ﻿I sought to pierce your mystery. ﻿Every man has a mystery. ﻿This place lends itself to spirituality. ﻿Spirituality can give us answers. ﻿I’m not asking the question. ﻿imagine not. ﻿I merely came... ﻿to contemplate. That’s all. ﻿Really? ﻿You came in, ﻿you had a little walk round, ﻿looked at the statues, the lights, the decoration... ﻿even lit a candle. ﻿Attracted by the picturesque, ﻿the atmosphere, ﻿a dose of mysticism. Own up! ﻿No one’s fooled. ﻿Least of all God. ﻿I’m not looking for God. ﻿But God sees you. ﻿God is a king. ﻿You came as a tourist! ﻿Christ chased the merchants from the temple. Sounds familiar? ﻿Yeah. ﻿It’s a parable. ﻿They’re facts! ﻿You only see statues, decorations, candles. ﻿Yet it all has meaning. ﻿I’m not really religious. ﻿That says ﻿You’re a fake. ﻿-A blasphemer. -Will you stop! ﻿The church is open to all. ﻿I've the right to be here. ﻿True. ﻿But only to the worthy. ﻿I’m not unworthy. ﻿Because you’re an artist? ﻿Yes. Because I’m an artist. ﻿Artist! ﻿It’s normal to doubt. ﻿You don’t doubt, you know. ﻿Artistically, you’ve done nothing good for ages. ﻿Your love life’s dead. ﻿Your films are worthl^ss^ ﻿You don’t need a church you need a shrink. ﻿Who are you? ﻿What does being an artist*me^an? ﻿You’re not an artist just because you say yoTPa^e. ﻿That's too easy. ﻿An artist has a mission, ﻿a need to transmit his world view, ﻿-to interpret that world. -Yes, of course. ﻿Art must open one to the ﻿You’re just a pretentious poser. ﻿You call yourself an artist because it feels good. ﻿It’s all talk. ﻿You want success, eh? ﻿That’s your motivation. ﻿To be admired, ﻿for your brilliancy. ﻿Red carpets and limbusines. ﻿No. That’s noPit^ ﻿It’s so childish. ﻿You just want to be loved, ﻿like a child. ﻿It’s in a child’s nature to love. ﻿To get love, you must give it. ﻿That goes for your private life too. ﻿You’re just an egotistical buffoon. ﻿You know that. ﻿It’s nothing new. ﻿Perhaps... ﻿You just needed to hear it said. ﻿Sisters! ﻿Come, sisters! ﻿Come! ﻿This is Mathias’ voicemail. ﻿Leave a message and I’ll call you. ﻿What do you want? ﻿-Hello Mathias. -Have you seen the time? ﻿Yes. ﻿I need to talk. ﻿Not now. ﻿It’s important. ﻿I’m waiting for someone. ﻿For sex. ﻿Oh... sorry. ﻿I’ll come back. ﻿Don’t. ﻿-I need to talk. -I’m not interested. ﻿It’s really important. ﻿Not for me. ﻿OK? ﻿ ﻿sorry. ﻿Good night! ﻿Good night. ﻿Good evening. ﻿Evening. ﻿I'll take... ﻿A falafel ? ﻿-Is it vegetarian? -Yes. ﻿I’ll take that. ﻿Sit down. ﻿Good evening. ﻿-Eat in or take out? -Take away. ﻿The usual. ﻿-Sir? -Thanks. ﻿Two Greek specials. ﻿-Sauce? -White sauce. ﻿Look at him! ﻿The tramp? ﻿You've seen his eyes? ﻿Look how he's eating! ﻿Any good? ﻿I'm gonna ask him. ﻿Are the fries any good? ﻿They're good? ﻿You like that ﻿Arab food, eh? ﻿No answer? ﻿That’s rude, isn’t it? ﻿Where are your manners? ﻿He must be deaf and dumb. ﻿Speak up! ﻿Are the fries any good? ﻿You think they're good? ﻿Let’s see.. ﻿Delicious. ﻿You're not hungry now? ﻿Will you stop that, please. ﻿Who asked you? ﻿He’s done nothing to you. ﻿You know this guy? ﻿Eat if you’re hungry. ﻿I don’t want your shitty food! ﻿Keep your eyes down when I’m talking. ﻿Answer or keep your head down. ﻿You think it's funny? ﻿You best watch yourself! ﻿Your shitty food! ﻿That’s enough! ﻿Leave him alone. ﻿He’s done nothing to you. ﻿Who the fuck are you? ﻿Don't fucking speak to me like that! ﻿He’s done nothing to you. ﻿Watch your back! ﻿Pathetic boy. ﻿Thank you. ﻿No problem. ﻿Do you want to sit down? ﻿Yes. ﻿Excuse me. ﻿Yes? ﻿The same again for him. It’s on me. ﻿That’s kind of you. ﻿-Are you OK? -Yes. ﻿-You left your scarf. -Thank you. ﻿It's coming. ﻿Thank you, young man. For the wrap and the fries. ﻿I said "young man". ﻿I could be your father. ﻿France is in a bad way, you know. ﻿Yet, it's the country of french fries. ﻿Fries are typically French. ﻿The English call them French fries. ﻿Here you go! ﻿We didn’t eat fries when I was a kid. ﻿We ate potatoes, ﻿and that’s all. ﻿My social class, anyway. ﻿The upper class ate fries. ﻿With red meat. ﻿Roast. ﻿When you’re young, ﻿you always think 'TH do this and that..." ﻿Never give up your dreams. ﻿Be yourself. ﻿Now, for example, ﻿I eat fries. ﻿As many as I want. When I want! ﻿You come here often, then? ﻿I’ve seen you before. ﻿I know you. ﻿Really? ﻿It’ll come to me. ﻿Perhaps it’s the beard. ﻿Like some kind of saint ﻿or Jesus. ﻿Are you a believer? ﻿I believe what I see. ﻿It'js just... ﻿Something odd happened to me earlier... ﻿a sort of miracle. ﻿There are no miracles. ﻿I found myself ﻿in mid-air, ﻿above the ground, ﻿like flying. ﻿I fly too. ﻿Everyone does. ﻿It’s no big deal. ﻿That’s it! ﻿I’ve placed you! ﻿My neighbor’s son. ﻿What’s her name? ﻿What’s your mother’s name? ﻿What? ﻿Let me just say, ﻿I’ve never trusted you. ﻿I don't like your face. ﻿Are you a foreigner? ﻿Yes. Like him. ﻿The Turks are different, ﻿they work hard. ﻿Not like council workers. ﻿All communists, ﻿all shirkers, ﻿they look after each other. ﻿ ﻿You Jewish? ﻿ ﻿I’m watching you. ﻿I watch everyone. ﻿I see everyone! I know everything! ﻿Sorry, I must go. ﻿Goodbye. ﻿Don’t take me for a fool. ﻿Don’t misjudge me! ﻿Piece of trash. ﻿Hello. ﻿I can’t believe you! You’re back? ﻿Yes. ﻿-Sorry. -I'm going. See you. ﻿Did I ask you to? Remind me. ﻿No. I wasn’t going to but I changed my mind. ﻿Come in. ﻿I was useless. ﻿I wasn’t up to it. ﻿I didn’t behave like a true friend. ﻿I’m sorry. ﻿You can’t just turn up. ﻿I’m not here for you. ﻿Let’s not stay angry forever. ﻿There’s no anger. You didn’t exist before tonight. ﻿I was a coward. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿And there was Frederic too.. ﻿It’s his fault, is it? ﻿No, ﻿but he did everything to separate us. ﻿He said it was your fault... ﻿Because- I had it coming to me? ﻿Leaving a club, drunk, so I had‘it coming to me? ﻿ ﻿I spent a week in hospital! Where were you? ﻿You still with him? ﻿ ﻿I left him. ﻿ ﻿Good news. ﻿Mathias. ﻿What? ﻿Please forgive me. ﻿Want one? ﻿Yes. ﻿Here. ﻿Thanks. ﻿May I? ﻿How are you? ﻿I’m OK. ﻿I’ve seen a shrink. ﻿I’ve stopped seeing some friends. ﻿A lot can happen in a year. ﻿A year already... ﻿Tell me... ﻿What made you turn up here ﻿in the middle of the night? ﻿It’s a strange night. ﻿Things have happened. ﻿Things? ﻿Yes. Something unreal, ﻿I wanted to tell you. ﻿What happened? ﻿In fact... ﻿I had to come. ﻿I couldn’t wait. ﻿How did you think I’d react? ﻿I just needed to talk to you. ﻿I just needed to see you. ﻿I don’t know if I should thank you. ﻿Perhaps you did the right thing, ﻿perhaps not. ﻿We’ll see. ﻿When’s your fifth film coming out? ﻿I’m shooting it. ﻿At the moment? ﻿Yes. It’s hard. I’m asking a lot of questions... ﻿Freaking out as usual! ﻿It’s different. ﻿I think I’ve been too ambitious. ﻿You have to be. Why continue otherwise? ﻿You reckon? ﻿I need to sleep. ﻿I’m knackered. ﻿Yeah. ﻿I’ll leave you in peace. ﻿By the way... ﻿I heard about your father. ﻿sorry. ﻿Yeah. ﻿The cancer had spread everywhere. ﻿Thanks. ﻿I'll be off. ﻿Good night. ﻿Safe journey. ﻿Thank you. ﻿ ﻿ ﻿What are you up to? ﻿-Here? -Yes, here! ﻿What do you like? ﻿All depends... ﻿Relax, man. ﻿Shall we go inside? ﻿Yeah. ﻿-Don’t you kiss? -All depends. ﻿All depends... Is that all you can say? ﻿You’re not hard. ﻿Give me some time. ﻿You think too much, eh? ﻿All depends. ﻿Suck me. ﻿That’s good. ﻿Fuck me! ﻿ ﻿ ﻿I’ve got no condom. ﻿PrEP. ﻿Yes, but... ﻿What? ﻿Are you clean? ﻿Yes, I am. ﻿It’s odd without protection. ﻿You know what PrEP’s for, then? ﻿Yes. ﻿Try to get hard first. ﻿ ﻿You don’t fancy me? ﻿I’m just not used to it. There are other STDs too. ﻿You’re freaked out. Stay at home! ﻿No, it’s not that. ﻿Stop, forget it! ﻿I don’t need your problems! ﻿-I’m sorry. -Yeah.

Walking? ﻿I like walking at night. ﻿You’re right, it’s another world. ﻿Much calmer. ﻿I don’t like smoking standing up, ﻿it’s like work! ﻿Do you get clients at this time? ﻿Sometimes. ﻿They’re less excitable than earlier on. ﻿Gentler. ﻿More relaxing. ﻿Are you local? ﻿ ﻿Here to see a friend. ﻿A long lost friend. ﻿I needed to talk to him. ﻿What about? ﻿Nosy! ﻿True. ﻿You live alone? ﻿Why do you ask? ﻿Why not? ﻿Do you live alone? ﻿Currently, yes. ﻿I’ve been married ﻿and divorced. ﻿I have a son. ﻿Are you married? ﻿Yes. ﻿No, I’m single. ﻿Have to get used to saying it! ﻿Is it recent? ﻿Quite. ﻿Were you together for long? ﻿years. ﻿I see! ﻿Being alone is good too. ﻿You’re free to do what you want. ﻿Was the divorce difficult? ﻿Yes. ﻿How long did it take you to move on? ﻿It took... ﻿two years. ﻿ ﻿To be honest, I wouldn’t change a thing. ﻿I got to know myself better. ﻿And there’s my son. ﻿What’s his name? ﻿Lolo. ﻿That’s nice.

You’re big now. ﻿Thanks. ﻿Will you tell me a story? ﻿Do you like stories? ﻿When I’m older, I’ll tell them! ﻿Really? like stories too. ﻿Was your dad proud of you? ﻿I think so. ﻿Will you tell me a story then? ﻿Yes I will. ﻿A little boy was walking by the canal. ﻿He was looking for fish. ﻿There were lots and lots of fish down there ﻿All different colors: ﻿yellow, red, green, ﻿one was orange, black too. ﻿But they didn’t like being watched, ﻿they thought he would eat them. ﻿So, they leapt from the water ﻿and hit the boy on the nose with their noses... ﻿Fish don’t have noses. ﻿They do! And they tickle! ﻿And I’m going to throw you in! ﻿-Where do you live? -That way. ﻿-Let me take you home. -OK. ﻿I’ll take you to your parents. ﻿-I told you there were lots of fish. -Not that many. ﻿-This way. -Yes. ﻿Let's go. ﻿I’ll tell your dad... ﻿Sir, are you OK?
