(thunders) - [Terry] It was like Cuba, 1962. Each side had to respect boundaries. You could smell the testosterone, the saber rattling, the brooding menace. Never before in living memory had the north and south bosses even been in the same room, yet here they were. Even pretending to like each other. Between them they would account for every major organized crime in the country. Oceans of blood on their hands. It was a piece of history. (tense music) But one wrong move. We should've been feeling proud, jubilation for the untold cordial. But for every false smile above the table underneath out of sight, that's where the truth was told. Like it always is. ("Me and The One I Love" by Dinah Washington) This couldn't end well. * Well who likes to walk in the rain * Dreaming of castles in Spain * Who touches clouds up above - I know I'm looking. There's an hotel somewhere up here. Bit further up I think. Nothing special but I have to buy a bloody coffee or something, which will probably cost about today's food allowance. - Sorry, I can't help it. - You can't just this once go behind the hedge or something? Course not no, you're right, always be a lady. - It's not just I. - Go on now hurry up. - [Girl] Oh come on what are you waiting for? - Alright alright. - Where's the toilet? - Right down there, I'll be in here. (coughs) - Sir, what can I get for you? - Oh my little girl just needs to use the bathroom, so uh. Yeah well, maybe a coffee then, cheap one, instant. - Hey Coco, how long you been waiting? - Oh I just got here, he's gone for coffee. - He's on duty and he's fucked off to get coffee? - No for me, he went to get it for me. (hums) - Stop it. (bangs) - Where's the fucking service, get the hand off your cock and get some drinks out here. - What can I get for you gentlemen? - Bushmills. - Water? - Ice. - You? - I'll have a lemonade. - Do you want a happy meal with that Bill? - I just want to keep a clear head. - So you can listen to our noble and gallant leader slurping on Claridge's cock. - Might want to watch your mouth kid, walls have ears. - Hmm, and the carpet's got a cunt. They should've told this prommy to piss of anyway, he shouldn't even be here. - So how much do I owe ya? - Nothing, we make enough to share with a hard working clown. - Well fuck my armpits, would you look at that? A fucking kike, actually giving something away. That's two hallucinations in one day Bill. I might have to let off the nine-- - Shut up! - What? - Well this is none of your business. - Well cocker, you just made it my business. - The man did me a good turn of which I'm grateful, and it would be spineless of me not to defend him. - Spineless? I'll tell you what Coco, you got some spine on you, I'll give you that. - No. - Button your cunt Sherlock. Come here you fucking! Come back here! (tense music) - Yes yes! Oh shit, oh shit she's not here. Shit she's in the bathroom. - Hello Coco, back for change? (slices) Get him up Moses. Gotta get him off of the floor, your trained for this. What's a matter? Gonna wait until he's blessed? (spits) There you go. See Bill, that's how you do it. Get some fucking knackers on ya. Tell those miserable bastards who's the governor. Move the fucking thing! - [Terry] There's about 800 murders in the UK every year. If murder is at the top, imagine how much other stuff gets done. How many rapes, beatings, thefts, frauds, it's a long list. - Here they are, Twiddle Dum and Tweedle Dew. Keeping each other company, are you chaps? - Well you gotta get relief while you can Tony. - Sit down Bill, I'll get you a little rubber ring. - Alright, Vic, I hope you agree that we've done some good work today. We don't always see eye to eye, but this time I think we greater than the sum of our component partners as Aristotle might say. - Put your cock away mate. Well yeah so-- - You got some yap on you young man. Get you into trouble that will. - Gonna set your whippets on me? - You might be advised to tone that mutt's ass Tony. - Let's not undo all the good work, eh? - No, wait, I'm not gonna hurt ya! (emotional music) No, don't go in there! - [Man] Take him awhile to see how things are done. - Don't chop me down, the king Rochelle sits. - You prefer to bruise your knees for your dandy boyfriend over there? - You just marked your card sunshine. - Calm down son, you can't expect to throw an insult like that and not get a reaction. - Hold on a minute, a line was crossed there. - So it was funny when he said it, but now when Terry did? - I'm not fucking-- - What do you fucking want? This is a private party. - Does anyone need anything? Anymore drinks? - Gentlemen, gentlemen, we live in cosmopolitan times. We have to recognize that our two cultures are diametrically opposed both geographically and diabolically. - [Terry] What did he mean he'd marked my card? Hope my face didn't give me away. Gary Little was a rough bastard. Cruel, and I was very fucking scared of him. - You mustn't forget that John has reached out for us. This is mutually beneficial, so let's try to be civil. Not fall back into our fucking neanderthal ways. Think you can manage that? - [John] We'll try. Gentlemen, I'm afraid I have to leave, but I look forward to doing business with you very soon. - Thanks John, it was a good move. (ominous guitar music) - Who wants chips and gravy? - Shut your fucking mouth Gary, make us look like a bunch pilots bickering. - Why do you want to work with these scabby cunts? - So Gary, Gary you think I'm a scabby cunt? - No, of course not. - So shut your fucking mouth you scabby cunt. Keep your heart rate down and try and get some sophistication. We got this thing started. We're going to ruin them, you understand Gary? So, don't question me anymore, right? (slaps) Okay, let's get back to civilization. - Shh, shh, it's okay it's okay. I'm not gonna hurt you. (sobs) - Killed my Daddy. - I know. - You wanna stop and get a sniff somewhere? - No. - What do you do for a laugh? - I don't kill clowns. - Here aren't we, we work hard, done well. What do you do for fun? - Me and my lady, we like antiques. - Fucking hell Bill, you sound like a dentist. Keeping me company. - So what do you do for kicks other than killing clowns on an afternoon? - Me, steal. - What's that? - Terry Singer's wallet. - Jesus. - You can learn a lot about a man from his wallet Bill. IA membership, receipts, no credit cards, hundred quid, and what's this, a wrinkly picture of his fuck piece, hidden in the lining. What about that Bill? Welfare square? - Why? - Knowledge is power Billy boy, slowly slowly, catching monkey. - You got something to say Gary? - Might be right for you having a boss thinking you're just a cunt, but it ain't for me. - Be very careful Gary. - Vic's the boss alright, I understand that. Not saying anything about that. He's got to end one day, just saying I'd like to be in line you know? Get a bit more respect. You'd make a great right hand though. - Do me no favors kid, I'm happy with my level. - Yeah, you don't like a savage behind your back do ya? - I'm not listening, why don't you just leave it alone? - Your level, great talent. - End of discussion eh? I mean, thanks for the vote and everything, but I'm not your man. Let's just say this conversation never took place alright? - Suit yourself. - Shit, shit! (emotional music) (speaks in foreign language) - [Terry] Alf had the dubious pleasure of being John Claridge's best mate. As they grew up, Alf proved to be more fucking useless every day. Pissed, stoned, in debt, whatever crap he got himself into, John took care of him. Now Gary Little had cut his throat and left his daughter fatherless. All for an ounce of sport. (screams) (crashes) - Fucking sly little, I'll tear his fucking eyes out! - Down it John. - I want his fucking blood. - Sorry John, we'll make this good. - I have him here for a fucking week before he fucking dies! All these fucking years of rubbing up against those fucking miserable jelly deal fucking knees up mother fucking brown shit heads. I believe in my world when you're holding a fucking olive branch and what do they fucking do? They kill my fucking friend! His daughter. Alf had a young lass. Where the hell is she now? - I don't know? I don't even know what she fucking looks like. - Fuck he kept her away from our thing. That's why he went around in clown masks. - We're gonna make this right John. I know how much you loved Alf. It's your business, so that makes it my business. Let's sort this the smart way, okay? - Danny, you must write everything down. Everything that happened so you don't forget, alright? Every fucking detail. - Every detail John. I will. - Where's Terry? (phone rings) - I spoke to him earlier, he wasn't making a lot of sense. - Shit, no I'm a few miles away so it will take me about-- - Hey sexy, how about we. - No, no, just the TV. - I think he was with a talent. - Sorry, sorry, sorry, sorry. - Not it's okay. - Do you have to go? - No. - Is it okay? - [Terry] I wish I could just say yes. Because everything should've been okay, better than okay. In any other circumstance, I was the luckiest man alive. Any other lads, even the married ones who are running around humping everything they could. But I had Willow. And she was everything. (piano music) She was all I ever wanted from the first moment I saw her. She blocked out the rest of the world, and I would've done anything for her. We risked our lives just to be together. - Hello sunshine. - Morning Mom, how are you feeling? Would you like a cup of tea? - No, I'm up for a decent brew, with a drop of Johnny Walker to pucker up a bit. They got me on this monkey piss, caffeine's supposed to make me die quicker or something. - It's camomile, it's supposed to be calming. There you go. - Give it to the bloody Arabs. You hungry love? - No. - Should ruddy eat. Nice plate of bacon and eggs to take some of those lines off your forehead. Lift me up, would you Terry love? Feel like a bag of ruffles stuck in this bloody chair. - Oh bloody hell Mum, you're the one that needs feeding. - Everything tastes like yellow fish. - What about some fruit or something? - Can't stand yellow fish. It's god's little joke. - Mum. - You're a good lad Terry, you've got a bloody good brain in your head. Get out. - No, Mum, not again. - For Christ's sake you can do it. - No Mum I can't, you know you don't resign. - No you bloody run for it as fast as your legs can carry, you go to Brazil and you-- - And who's gonna look after you? - Now's the time Terry. Make something of your life. I wish your dad had, I'd have been happy poor. - What do you mean now is the time? You're not going anywhere. - Tell me about her love? - What are you on about? - I've waited years to see that worry on your face, the look of a man that doesn't want to bring the love of his life into this stupid bloody business. How long has it been? - A few months, it's a mess though. - Life's a bloody mess Terry love. I'm not gonna be sitting in this bloody chair forever, I don't want to, all I want is for you to be happy. And to stay away from Claridge and all that shite that goes with him. - Come here. I am happy Mum. - You don't know what happiness is, 'til you will. - [Vic] Well go on then. - I swear to almighty fucking God Vic, I just thought it was some mouthy prick trying to rob me. I'd no idea. - We were fucking guests, we were there to fucking listen. - But if someone's gonna rob you? - I don't fucking care what would you do, if we invited some northern fucking primate down here, and he slit Tony's throat. - Wait, I fucking saw that. - Now Vic. - Oh, it speaks. - There was nothing Gary could do, he thought he was being robbed. - What did you do Bill? What did you do eh? Did you remind Gary he's on foreign turf? What he's fucking there for. Or did you sit like a big fat lazy piece of shit? Watching the whole thing play out because you're too fucking idle and dense to do anything. You're the worst fucking thorper there is. He just lost his temper, but you lost your fucking brains! Fucking ginger moron! - Wait, what was that face about Gary, that little face you pulled back? - You got something to say to me? - Go on get out of my house the both of ya! Get out now! - You're an idiot you. - What are you fucking worried about? It's me he's pissed off with. Fancy what he calls you though? If I was about, he'd be fired in daylight. Who's the midge? - Don't even think about it? - Who is it? - That's Vic's daughter, you stay away. - Hello sweetheart, I'm Gary. - Hi Gary, I'm Willow. (tense music) - It's alright puppet go on. - I was under the table, but later on when they all left. - Right. - The old one got close with the one that killed my daddy, he said, he said, I'll let this whole thing get started, then I'll ruin them. And he thumped Gary. (sobs) - Good girl, and well told, you're brave. - Yeah you are brave, you're very very brave. You're daddy was a dear dear friend of mine, and that's why I'm gonna take care of you. You get yourself tidied up and we'll see you in a bit. - Come on, come on here. (slams) - Fuck! - Whatever has to be done. - [Brian] We only get one chance. - What the murder was a distraction? - Maybe, take an eye off things while they think about how they might fucking ruin us. I don't like how they knew about Alf. Me and Alf was private. - Well it's no one in this fucking room John. - I know that. What I don't know is how they knew. - John, we need to do something, before they get their hands all over our business. - Alright, alright, Terry get out there and tidy things up. Put the fear of god into all our people and all their fucking people so that if anybody sees anything, they come straight to you alright? - Yeah. - Penny, can you contact Gustave? - Okay now, shall I read the words or, can you remember? (laughs) - What do I say? - Just your name and the date. Try not to piss yourself. - My name is Isley Cutler, and I'm being held ransom by this fucking mad Frenchman. It's the 17th-- (gun fires) - Oh yeah. - [Terry] This is the face of evil. The last face that anyone ever sees. No one alive knows what Gustave looks like. He keeps it that way. (tense rhythmic music) He's well known locally as a transvestite. But as soon as he appeared on the street he would vanish without a trace into his own secret world. - Fucking freak. - [Terry] Little doubt any of the sticks he did on the outside knew what he did for a living. He'd only deal with select people. (phone rings) And he wouldn't tolerate bad manners. Only top brass could actually get to him. - Yes? - [Terry] But he loved Penny. Even though they'd never met. - Okay, so do nothing at the moment yes? - [Terry] Penny ticked every box. - Tell me details. And a reasonable price. - [Terry] Cool, sexy, sophisticated. - My lady's hand in marriage. - [Terry] Deadly. (sprays) - Morning! Okay, who's in charge? Who's the boss? - My dear, what can I do for you, some soap and wax? Don't be disrespectful. Ignore those thugs my dear, come take a seat while we make your car like new. I'm Wally. Welcome to Wally car wash. - Business good Wally? - Hey, what the fuck do you think you're doing? - Paying your tax for you. - Get your hands off my money you fucking whore! (thuds) (screams) - Five thousand, John Claridge, every Monday. - But I don't make five thousand pounds! (thuds) But I don't make-- (thuds) (groans) - No fucking bullshit! Get some manners. - [Terry] I wish I had a turn of their confidence. The truth is, I'm not like them. I'm only in it because of me old man. Though he was a warrior, I'm not. I've got a great mask. But underneath I'm shitting blood every day. So I had to go around to our associates, bully them into being loyal. Reporting back. - Business good lads? - [Terry] It's not easy when your 10 stones dripping wet. - Where's my phone call? - [Terry] Plus I had a conscience that my colleagues didn't. And it was bad for business. - Stupid little prick. - [Terry] So over the years I'd convinced myself that my small deeds didn't count in a world where entire nations could be wiped out in the name of God. It's different when you're up close looking in their eyes. I've got a mate who was in Afghanistan who says, he'd never killed a man until you smelled his breath. That's the life I'm in. We're both soldiers and we don't get to make choices. - Where was he, Terry? You said you thought he was with a talent, but what do you actually know? Come on. - John. You're angry, don't jump to conclusions. I'll ask where he was, I'll be subtle. - You said he was a few miles away. - Something like that, I didn't take too much notice. John, please, your cabinet is safe. - Penny? Alright, alright, alright. Keep an eye open. I don't want a single thing unreported, I want to know everything. - Yeah of course. (buzzes) - Well they're gonna come back with something. His best mate, bled him like a stuffed pig inside some fucking hotel. We should be ready for anything. Well I guess they could kill Gary do us all a fucking favor. - Hey, for fucks sake. (moans) - Stop moaning. - Oh you fucking laugh at that about my pain shit! Ah, thanks, thanks darling thank you. - Good with it? - It's like there's a ball of steel cable underneath both your shoulder blades. - Fucking kidding. Well done darling. Lovely, go and treat yourself. - No, remember. - She's my bloody nurse as well. - Not your girl man. - Listen, don't talk specifics in front of her. - Sorry Vic, I was thinking out loud. - Please do me a favor, don't keep talking about plugging Gary. I know he's a mouthy little fucker but he's my mouthy little fucker. And we don't dump on our own. I'm gonna get him to talk to Brian Galloway. I'm gonna get him to apologize. - You're fucking joking ain't ya? I mean we are talking about Gary fucking no brains Little here. - I know he's a fucking maniac, I know it, you know it, and he fucking knows it. What can he do? And I don't like this John chip butchy Claridge any more than you do. But listen Tony, fuck me, I don't want a fucking war. We can fleece him just the same if Gary plays the game. - Yeah well fucking good luck with that. - Hey, you gotta earn your stripes. You don't have a dog and bark. (laughs) - Oye, glad you heard it yourself. Means he wasn't making it up. Big fat lazy little shit. Hey, shit skin, who more pints. - Could you get us a large whiskey as well please mate, no ice. - Fuck it, bring the bottle. - So when do you think the meeting will be? - What meeting? - You and Galloway, tell them how sorry you are. - You gotta be kidding aren't ya? Not in a million years mate. I got a to do list Billy Boy, that ain't on it. Tony Lefevre might be, Skinny northern maggot Terry Singer might be. Do you know that's not even his real name? - What? - [Gary] Lefevre. - Thanks. - Real name's Thompson. Tony fucking Thompson. He's got on for that flunky shit, so he changed it. How can you trust a man like that? Says fuck off with Vic's judgment doesn't it. Borrowed time. - Vic's the boss. - Would you do it? - Apologize of course, it's a no brainer. - I told you we're a perfect balance. Me, might as well chop off me own cock, no fucking way. - So what's your plan? - Come come now Billiam, that's for insiders only. - So now you have insiders? - Be my right hand man first. Come on. What's left to consider, we'd be a knockout. - In couple of days yet. - See that Bill, looks like a wallet doesn't it? - Yes Gary it does. - But it ain't. It's a nuclear bomb. - Don't you overdramatize everything Gary? - And low, what treasures didst it behold. - You got that in the wallet? - Showed you in the car the other night, you couldn't see it, then I saw her at Vic's garden. Boom. - If Vic finds out about that, you'll be in the ground by morning. - We'll be in the ground, Bill. You know as well now. We. - Watch yourself here. - IT's a bomb here, can only use it once. I do get itchy fingers. It's fucking perfect. Been a long time coming Billy boy. A long time coming. (acoustic guitar music) - [Willow] Sometimes I could sit motionless for hours. Suspending time until he knocked on the door. * Walking through the streets * Waiting for a call it's 10 and 24 I'm in love He was my god, all I needed. * Like you're all I need * When I shake his hands * I go back to the house and fix the door He was living a hell, a saint in a devil's world. Only a deity could stand it. We had our own secret place, where no one would ever find us. Our own piece of heaven where we left the real world outside the door. - Willow. What's wrong? (phone rings) Oh Christ no. Fuck's sake. - Brian. - [Brian] Where are you? - Just having a nap. - [Brian] Where? - I'm just at my Mother's house. - Right, well come down the hotel will you, now. - What, no I can't. - See you in about 15 minutes. - No Brian, Brian, Brian? (beeps) Fuck! - What's wrong? - Brian wants to see me at the fucking hotel. - When, now? - 15 minutes. - You can't. - I told him I was at my mother's house, it's a fucking test. - A test, how? - He's looking for a fucking rat. We just met. And I can't keep making up excuses for when I'm with you, I just can't. - Oh Terry, you shouldn't have come tonight. - I know, how could I not come. Just think about what I said. - They'd find us. What about your mum? - Would you run? - I am nothing without you. - I'm sorry. - What for? Being my savior? Being my whole world? Terry, there will be a right time to run. - This is gonna be good mate, honestly. We're doing the right thing. I was born by the river. Dogs gonna go through the roof mate, love it. (hums) Looking forward to it Hold that will you? Bill, hold that I need to piss. Fucking state of you. Vic thinks he's got it all sussed doesn't he? But he doesn't know what he's fucking dealing with. I can't wait, it's gonna be beautiful. Fucking beautiful. Do you want to come an hold it for me you fucking puff. - Shut up, you drive me mad all day. Just let me piss in peace. - Give us a pull on that will ya? Yeah, you've made the right decision. To changes. - Changes. The more I know, the less I understand. I'm a changing man. (thuds) - You love this bottle don't you Bill? You fat fucking cunt. Way to go eh? To drown in your own booze. There's no other monkeys calling now are they? (groans) (thuds) (thuds) (thuds) (thuds) (laughs) (thuds) (phone rings) (tense music) - Brian? Brian? - Thank you Mr Claridge, I always wanted to ride a horse. - Oh really, so you like that one? - I love her. - Well, that's good, cause she's yours now. Yeah, thought that would bring a little smile to your face. I'm gonna really look after you. - Thank you. - But I do want you to do me a favor. I want you to stay here with Penny. Now it's a lovely big house, and you'll have your horse nearby. That'll be alright won't it? - Yeah. - And while you're here, I want you to listen out for anything you think I should know about. You know like you did at the hotel that time? - You want me to spy on her? - Oh no, not spy, no not really. No Penny and I are really good friends. We do a lot of business together. Sometimes she just forgets, she gets so busy, she just forgets to tell me things that I need to know. - Okay. - And we'll keep it our little secret won't we? Because we don't want to embarrass Penny do we? And anyway you'll be my little helper. - Will she mind that I'm here? - Get a bloody nanny! - It's only for a bit. - How am I supposed to earn with a child hanging off me. - Well she won't be there all the while won't she? Come on Pen? - I can't do my bloody job. - Well she's got nowhere to go poor thing. - It's not my problem, get one of your women to look after her. - You know, I did have this idea. Daft maybe but, you see she could be a real help for you. Train her up. - To kill? John please. - You see, no one knows who she is. - No, it's insane. - No one would even look twice at her. You know I wouldn't do anything that you weren't 100 percent okay with, know that Pen? I'm gonna look after her no matter what, and you are the natural choice to help me. You were an orphan once remember? What if no one had given you a chance? - A chance? Yeah, I got a chance alright, didn't I John? I had a chance to lose my cherry at 13 years old to a wreaking hand fisted stranger and then I got the chance to do it again and again until I had not a shred of self worth left. Don't talk to me about chance. If I hadn't learned how to kill, I'd probably still be out there doing it now. - Yeah I know, I know. Terrible. And we wouldn't want that for young Sammy now would we? - Fuck you John. (emotional piano music) - Hello. (laughs) - Fucking hell. I'm sorry Vic, what can I say? - An eye for an eye. Seems we underestimated them, mustn't do that again. - What can I do Vic, I'm all yours. - I want you to keep your hands clean, you understand. I want you to use help and keep your distance because I don't want to point out that you started this. But you've started this. - Vic, I didn't know, I fucking swear. He was my mate too, how could I know? - You couldn't have done, that's why you're still alive. Now you listen, and you listen closely, you, you're not to get anywhere near this fucking action, you understand me? - Yes. - You find the team, but you, you stay clear of it. You got it? - Fucking yes. Why don't we get Gustave? - Well what makes you think you can get him? - He's a greedy fucker, money. - No. - Why not? - Find someone else. - But he-- - Shut the fuck up, just do what you're fucking told for once! - I'm sorry. Who's the target? - You won't get near Brian Galloway, or Claridge. And we don't want that little pup Terry Singer, he's a fucking waste of time. But I want that posh bitch in little fucking pieces. - [Terry] Vic had given Gary license to go off and get dirtier. He fell right into Gary's hands. He would have the distance and smoke screen to divide and conquer. John was already paranoid. Bill Vincent's murder would send him spiraling deep into the abyss. - Send your family away. - Nothing's happened. - No, but it's going to. - Fuck, sorry John tried to call. - Morning Terry, I missed you last night. - I was here, just a bit late. - Yeah, and out of breath. - What? - So, what's the news? - Well you know what the fucking news is, why didn't you fucking tell me? Hey, how come Penny gets the action you can't even tell me? - What are you talking about, Sam? - For fuck's sake John, I've been waiting my whole fucking life. And me old man. - What are you on about you deft bastard? - Bill fucking Vincent. - What about him? - Someone's popped him, thought it was you. - No, I told him to wait for instructions, no money. It wasn't Gustave. - [Gustave] Sit. - Gustave? - [Gustave] What do you want? - What is this, wizard of Oz? I came to hire you? - [Gustave] For what? - Paint my fucking living room. - [Gustave] I don't think you can afford me. - Oh yes I can sunshine, it's whether you're up to the job or not. You're not the only show in time. Could take my 750 grand somewhere else. - [Gustave] Who? - Vic Clarke. - [Gustave] Who knows that you're here? - No one. - You're quite sure? - I came to put a contract in on Vic Clarke's head. Didn't think it was prudent to broadcast that. (gun fires) - Little shit. Vic already offered me nice money for you. And he will pay me again, and again. Could you wait here, while I get my camera. (gun fires) (gun fires) (tense music) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) (gun fires) - Fucking shit! - [Terry] Gary played us against each other like a maestro, but now, he didn't know who was shooting at him. As far as he was concerned, he'd seen Gustave die. It was the nearest Gary had ever come to being cornered. He was more dangerous than ever. - You look through the scope, check range for trajectory. Hold cross hairs on your target. And gently take off the safety. - You classless whore. - There's three and a half here. - I don't have five. - You watch, like a hawk. Concentrate for any threat to your partner and then you hold your finger over the trigger with just enough pressure. - Fucking bullshit! I said five! (gun fires) - Was that you? I'm really sorry I think it was me that broke the window. - I'll take it out of your earnings. - Sorry. (buzzes) - Yep. - [John] It's John, we need to meet up as soon as you can. - What's wrong? - [John] Nothing on the phone, can you make it in an hour? - At the hotel? - [John] No, your place I think? - My place? - [John] Yeah, just leave Sam out riding with the groom or something. - [Terry] It was always the hotel, we never met anywhere else. - Okay. - [Terry] But now John wanted us to meet at Penny's house in the middle of nowhere. As in the only witness out to ride the horse that he had given her. (upbeat music) John used to say we were. - Tighter than a nun's clopper. That's how we stay ahead. God bless and good health. - [Terry] We ran through anything, nothing was too big. We didn't just start knocking shops and bookies, we did whole fucking shopping centers. We took 60 percent from the nightclubs. Yeah 60 percent. - Alright love. - [Terry] Coppers didn't give a fuck. - Hello boys. - [Terry] We'd be doing their job and paying them more than their shitty salary. Never a squeak of bother. Otherwise our associates would have a less than friendly word. (thuds) We made millions and John always did the right thing. He spread it around to those he needed. But now, we were in a mess. - Go. Fire that weapon and you'll blow your head off. (clicks) No mistakes. - I'm sorry, that was stupid. - We'll just be talking in the kitchen okay? I want you to come out and offer people drinks when they've all arrived, got it? You okay? - You won't tell John about the window will you? - No, it's none of his business, why? - It's just that, if I don't tell him, he might take away the pony. - Why would you want to tell him? Sam, Sam, are you supposed to tell him things. - Promise you won't tell. - I promise. - He just wanted me to tell him about anything unusual. But he didn't want me to tell you because you might be embarrassed or something. - [Gary] Thanks for doing this side project for me Jeff. - [Jeff] Fucking hell, where have you been? Fucking West Bank? - [Gary] Price of doing business. You on your own? - [Jeff] Yeah, fuck me it's like Swiss cheese-- (gun fires) (car starts) (horse neighs) - Okay, why are we here? - No we best wait for Terry before we get into-- - I'll tell you what John, smart as a bloody tac that one. Happens to be smarter than he looks god bless him. - Didn't see your car Terry. - Didn't you? - I'm afraid we've had some rather sad news on your mother this morning. No one could get through on your phone. I'm sorry lad, she was a good woman. She'll be sadly missed. - [Terry] Not a word, not even a nod. My mom had been loyal and silent for him all these years, and he didn't even look at me. Pathetic bastard. We'd given him our lives, everything, and he didn't even look at me. - Can I get you all refreshments please? - I thought she'd be riding? - Sam wanted to serve you when she found out you were coming. - No I don't want anything thanks. - Well, I'll have scotch and soda if there's one going, in the preschool kitchen. - Just a water Sam. - So, we are current. - Who topped Bill Vincent. - Not me. - Well it certainly wasn't an accident. He drowned in whiskey from the bottle that was lodged 10 inches in his throat. - Well there must be a million crooks around London that would want him dead. - And how do you know that? - Well we've all got targets on our heads don't we? - Here you go. - Thank you. - Now can I get anyone a biscuit or anything-- - Look this isn't Dolly fucking Carner, now piss off out of here. I need to know who killed Bill fucking Vincent. I need to know that this team is still intact. I need to know where you keep fucking off to. And I need to know that you're not fucking Gustave. - Well, depends what you mean by fucking. - I'm sorry Penny but the house keeping's getting sloppy. Now we've never had any trouble before. - So you feel that you need to keep an eye on me, put a spy on my house. - Somebody is fucking about with me and I need to know who! (dog barks) - It's me, what time is it? - [Tony] Nearly seven. - No news here? - Nothing. - I'll tell you what, give him some incentive. If he finishes her tonight, let him loose on that Terry Singer he's got such a hard on for. - [Tony] That'll make him perk. - Good. Oh, don't worry darling. I'm still here. (sobs) - Listen to me. You can have Singer, and don't play me back, I'm playing fucking golf. - [Gary] Well why don't I just clean the fucking lot. - Don't be fucking stupid. - [Gary] If I do it myself, it'll be done tonight. - Why haven't you cleaned the first one yet. - I couldn't get all my stuff in time. I need a specialist, their stubborn these days. - You get it fucking finished tonight and you make sure it's fucking spotless. - Fuck you you fucking lanky straight up wannabe french fucking piss. - Come on Sam, I know it's been a hard day, but you have to learn to toughen up. You're a little girl now, but soon you'll be a woman. - He said that he'd take care of me. - He will but. - He's friends with Daddy. - John is emotional, which means that sometimes he does emotional things. He shouts at everybody. He is like a big bossy, bossy boots. Look at you making me soft. (phone rings) - Terry? - [Terry] Hello? - Terry is that you? - Yes, it's me. What's wrong, are you okay? - Someone's coming after you tonight. I heard Daddy say it to Tony, you have to leave and hide Terry please. - It's not Gary Little is it? - I think so, maybe, I'm not sure. Please, we'll go tonight. We'll run like you said. - No no we can't. He'll find us if he's already looking. - I've got money, we could just go somewhere. - Did you hear anything else, anything at all? - If he finishes her tonight, he'll let him loose on that Terry Singer. - Willow, don't call me again okay? He knows about us, my wallet went missing. He must've taken it, he's seen your picture. - Oh God Daddy. - No, it's okay, I've just got to do some stuff alright? - Just don't do anything stupid okay. Please Terry I need you. - I just need you to act normal okay? Wipe me off your phone. Remember the number and get rid of it, alright? - I can help. - No, no you mustn't. - I can end this. I'm gonna end this. - [Terry] Until now I didn't know if it was John or Gary who I'd been running from, and Gary was going first, but still I felt like John would send someone for me as well. I couldn't risk it. Willow had a plan, it was desperate, dangerous. But it was solid, it was final. Strictly speaking, Danny worked for John, to keep things smooth at the hotel. - Danny? - [Terry] He wasn't any kind of thug. - Mate I need a favor. - [Terry] But he ran a couple of crews. He was a great front for the business. I put him there when his brothers were killed and he was in a dark place. To me, he was just the right man for the job. But to him, well, he felt like he owed me big time. Enough to risk his life. I had to get to Penny before Gary. First so I could save her. Second, so I knew where the little bastard was. I reckoned he was coming from the south. It would take a while so I had time for a little detour. - Terry, what's going on. - Gary Little's on his way up here form London. He's supposed to clip Penny then me. Look if he's up here afterwards it can't be long before the rest of the south is here as well. - How do you know? - It's my fucking job isn't it? Or should I not fucking look out for you? - Are you sure? - Of course I'm fucking sure. Right, he's going for Penny, so I'm gonna catch him there. Now I don't think he would be stupid enough to come here but I'll try to nail the fucker before he gets the chance. - There'll be more of them, he can't be on his own. - Yeah, let 'em come, they won't get in here. - Can I take Danny for his eyes? - Well if you like. Well then Brian, it's time to show that little shit shack just how big he really fucking is. Bring in Dretcher's men, we'll have a man behind every blade of fucking grass. If he does manage to get out of that stupid car of his, we'll turn in into a fucking colander. - Oh no don't worry about me and Penny John. Thanks for the warning Terry. Sorry to hear about your mum. How are we doing? Here. - No Terry. This is my turn to repay you. - It could be a long time before I see you again. Mate, I want you to be safe. Use that to go abroad, tonight. - I don't want the money. - You'll need it, now go, go on. I've got a few calls to make. - Thanks Terry. You're a ledge. - Not yet but I'm trying. - [Vic] Willow what are you doing here? - My God Daddy, you nearly gave me heart failure. - What you doing in my office? - Oh I'm sorry I just thought that I left my credit card in here. - Why would you leave your credit card in my office. - Bloody hell Daddy, do you have to ruin every surprise? - Well I'm surprised to find you in my office. (phone rings) Gary. - Got some news for you Vic. You sitting down? - Just since your birthday, I wanted to do something special, needed some help. Well I could hardly ask you for numbers could I huh? Mister interrogator. (tense music) Now I can't tell you anymore, I've ruined it now anyway. - Call Tony. - Vic? He hung up on me you cunt. - Come here, come here. Your Mother's little girl. Word of advice, keep that precious brain clear. Just having a name could make you an accessory. - Yeah, well sorry Daddy, I just got to find another way to get around you. - That'll be the day. - [Terry] These seconds were valuable. But I had to be 100 percent sure that John and Brian were taken care of before I get to Penny's. (buzzes) Penny it's me, call me as soon as you get the message right away it's important. (sirens blare) Good luck Danny. (men yell) - [Terry] John burst out like a pit bull for a tear up with Gary Little, and whoever he brought with him. Even faced with an armed response unit surrounding him, John thought he was untouchable. - How are you doing Gary, how's your kid. - [Terry] But thanks to Danny. - How's the shop doing? - He blew it up! - [Terry] 10 kilos of heroin found on his premises meant he would never get out. - Alright Vic? - What are you doing here? You're supposed to be up North. - Sandra said I should just come home. (gun fires) (groans) Sandra said it was okay. (tense music) - It's like fucking Rome in here. - I said it was okay Vic. - Sandra. (gasps) - Alright Vic? (phone rings) - [Vic] Ah, Gustave. - Bonjour Mr Clarke. - I was wondering if you could get around to executing my instruction, if you pardon the pun. - [Gustave] He's been here already. - What? - Gareth, he wanted me to target you. - Well why didn't you fucking tell me? - Oh shit on fucking toast you fucking faggoty, froggy fuck! Lousy bastard. (phone rings) Ah Gustave, forgive my little outburst, my spirits have been somewhat heightened by your count of events. - Think nothing of it. - So how much did he offer you? - He offered me a million. - A million, Jesus wept he hasn't got a million. - I think we both know that you would have to get it. - Gustave I'll offer you one and a half million, but I want the bastard to suffer. - Yes yes, actually it's quite funny. The little man, did you hear my accident joke? The little man shooted me, so I wanted to sort it out myself. But anyway, we do a deal, isn't it. - Yeah, well he's up north at the moment doing a bit of cleaning up. Some Tophinos Bint, yeah he'll be up there tonight? - Tophinos, what it is? - Oh some posh totty, Penny something. I don't know her second name. - Bye bye. (beeps) - Yeah yeah, fucking prick! (emotional piano music) (phone rings) Come on Tony come on. Answer the bloody phone. (knocks) - Are you Victor? This yours? - [Terry] We all knew that Lefevre would fold and try for a deal if he faced life, and he'd take Vic down. No fucking spine. - These are fucking sandbags. There's enough H here to stop us an army. You're up for free Lefevre. This is a supply and a fucking half, this is life! No question, fucking life and a half. - Get my fucking Lawyer. - [Terry] She got one of Vic's under crews to drop a shit load of heroin at Lefevre's place. - Right now. - [Terry] And called the police. It was the ultimate betrayal. (tense music) (TV noise) Penny it's me. Call me as soon as you get this message, right away it's important. (phone rings) - Terry? (gun fires) (gun fires) (glass shatters) (helicopter blades whirl) (gun fires) oh shit. (gun fires) - [Terry] Little bastard got me. - Ah fuck fuck. - Oh Jesus Sam. (whooshes) - You fucking mug. (whooshes) (screams) (shatters) - Penny, it's your favorite man. - Gustave? - I've got a southern fried rat for you. Whoa, I need to speech a man's scale. (gun fires) - Jesus Pen you're getting slow. - Sam, that was Gustave. You shot Gustave, he was here to help us. (tense music) - Move Pen! (gun fires) Oh minging. - Terry hated being a crook. He said that so much was expected of you, like a prince, but with more blood. We were just waiting for our chance to get away, if that took all my life then I was prepared. I didn't know that I could ever betray Daddy like that. I know that he was a bad man but he was kind and beautiful to me and he loved me dearly. Terry was my god. All I needed. I would live with the guilt if I could live it with him. But, I knew this time he wasn't coming. This time it would be someone else. A stranger. And without Terry, I just wanted it to be quick. Hoped there was a heaven. (knocks) - You wish to have this? - Terry Terry Terry. (emotional music)
