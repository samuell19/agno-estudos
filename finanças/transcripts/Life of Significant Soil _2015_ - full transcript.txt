[chatter] [droning music playing] [droning music playing] CONOR [VOICEOVER]: What if every single turn of the day, we leave our bodies behind, and we're forced to walk around that day for eternity, never advancing or experiencing anything new-- spilling the same coffee or winning the same lottery? And those little pieces of us-- they get stuck. We forget them, as if they meant nothing to us, you know? Every day we've ever lived still exists somewhere. We're still inside of it. ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: What if we're there now and this is one of those days? [air conditioner humming] [trickling] Fuck! [sigh] There's piss on that. - Yeah. It's positive. - Are you-- - Positive? Yes. Bad timing. Yeah. It's going to be humid as shit today. This is just a freak rainstorm. I meant about the whole pregnant thing. [smacking] [SOFTLY] Oh, fuck. [SOFTLY] God dammit. [smashes] Oh, fuck. CONOR: Shit. What the hell? CONOR: The window really plays a big part in holding those things in, huh? Yeah. Yeah. I guess we're just supposed to sweat to death today. Well, maybe I'll get a fan. Maybe you should check with Hue. [knocking] [music playing] Jack? Jack, are you in here? Jack? [softly chuckles] [coughing] That one. Go. Hey. Could I borrow a fan? I'm sorry. I was just watching the future. Something I should worry about? [music playing] [SINGING] Today, I found my fossil, my baby when I came home. And lying next to her was just like lying there alone. Her body was on one side, turn so petrified. Her pretty hands-- they both had turned to stone. Now, you've got stone-cold hands. And you're going to leave. [scoffs] Give me a break, man. It's just weed. Why don't you smoke, again? CONOR: I just don't. But you've tried it, right? Yea, I've tried it. Well, where were you when you tried it? I mean, what? Next, you're going to want to know what the weather was like, right? It doesn't really matter, does it? JACKIE: You know, I've been doing this for a while now. And I've just almost drowned myself. And I can see things. I can feel them, you know? CONOR: Yeah. But the first time, I mean, you were just trying to drown yourself, right? Addison's pregnant. So I'll have to make it too? You going to wrap up with her? That wasn't funny. No. I saw you dying today underwater. I couldn't tell where or how. But the wind was blowing all around. And then you just disappeared. Have you ever been right before? JACKIE: I did it during a commercial break for "Law and Order" once. And I knew which character was guilty. Then I realized it was a rerun. So yes and no. [music playing] Thanks. HUE: Conor? What the hell are you doing here, man? - Yo. - Huh? Nothing really. I mean, I'm look-- I'm kind of looking for a fan. You're looking for a fan? CONOR: Yeah. I figured you got something in here, you know? HUE: Mm hmm. Well. Is it going to take very long, you think? TATTOO ARTIST: Uh, yeah. I mean, if it hurts too much, we can take a break. No, no. It's OK. Thanks. [tattoo pen buzzing] [SOFTLY] Ah. OK. Yeah. No, wait. It does hut a lot. It kind of feels like tickling, you know? Like, oh, really bad tickling-- like pinching tickling. Well, that means it's working. OK. [music playing] What's the nicest thing you do for me? When you get out of the shower and your hair is all wet. And then you come to bed. And you lie down. And then you remember you forgot something in the bathroom. And when you get up, I switch pillows with you so that your pillow is dry. You like how fresh mine smells. Well-- well, when you home really late and I sleep on your side of the bed. And then when you get home, I wake up. And I roll over to the side so that you don't have to sleep on the cold sheets. Yeah, but you like the cold sheets. It's kind of the same thing. OK. Um, all right. Uh, well, what about when I get up really early in the morning, and I-- and I put on a pot of coffee for you. And I mean, you know, I don't drink your coffee. I mean, I cannot stand that shit. I mean, that's pretty nice, right? That's really nice. Yeah. That's pretty nice. [music playing] [air conditioner humming] [smashes] Did you put the AC back in somehow? ADDISON: What? What the f-- what the hell? - What? I'm dying it. - Yeah. I know. I-- I see that. I mean, you don't think we could have had a conversation first? Wh-- you weren't going to say anything to me? OK. OK? Excuse me. Hey? Wha-- all right. OK. Just-- just visualize now. OK? You're out. Your day is all fucked up. And you come home. And I'm, like, a ginger. And I didn't even say anything. Well, what if I don't recognize you or something? Oh, what? Like, out of a police lineup? Yeah. That's a good idea. You're so ridiculous. CONOR: I mean, you know, these things happen all the time, you know? I'm not just making thi-- hey? Did you put the AC back in though? OK. No. That's all you had to say. [music playing] Jack? Thanks. Thank you. Same rain. Same air conditioner back. Everything the same. Yeah. Well, what are we going to do about it? I don't know. DOCTOR: Are your eyes green or blue? Um, Hazel I think. What does that mean? It's just the, uh, combination of colors-- usually green and blue, sometimes some yellow. Yeah, no no. I mean, um, what's the significance of her eye color mean? Does it-- does it mean something's wrong? I-- her eyes have always been Hazel, right? Yeah, maybe. I mean, Yes. I think so. Does that mean anything? No. I'm sorry. I think there's some confusion. I was actually just curious as to what her eye color was. They are so big. [chuckles] These are just notes for my last patient actually. Anyhow, what happened to your head? Um, I think that I'm having hallucinations. Mm. Or maybe we're both having them. Have you taken any drugs or alcohol recently? No. CONOR: Mm mm. DOCTOR: Addison, any change in hormones-- birth-control pills maybe or pregnancy? Uh, no. Mm. Mm mm. DOCTOR: Let's do a word association, Conor. I'm going to say a word and you say the first thing that comes to your mind. It could be anything. It's just a simple test. I'm going to find out what's going on in there. OK? Addison. What? No, not you. Conor, word association. ADDISON: Oh. Sorry. - Addison. - What about her? Do you not know how to play word association? CONOR: Is this a trick question? What about you? I don't-- Just answer the question. You say the day is repeating. What happens when the day starts? ADDISON: Well, our AC is broken. [smashes] DOCTOR: Mm. That's the first thing that happens? ADDISON: Yep. Have you gotten it fixed yet? ADDISON: No. I don't think that's going to do anything. - Fucking quack. - Oh, my god. A reaction? I didn't realize you could be affected by someone else. You know, I'm affected just like anyone else. I mean, just because I don't make a big deal out of it like every other crybaby doesn't mean I'm not. OK? Is that OK with you, Add? Yeah, that's OK, Con. Does it bother you that your name shortens into "con?" It seems kind of negative, don't you think? It lengthens into "confidence." Everybody knows that. Yeah. Well, it's not contraception, that's for sure. Add. Get in the car. Hey, would you have liked me better if my name was "Surprise?" CONOR: What? Well, that was almost my name when I was born. My mom was expecting twin boys. You'd be a real hit at parties. Yeah? Would you like that better? CONOR: Get in. Yeah, sure. Just get it. You know, the doctor said that we should get the AC fixed. Sure, whatever. Look, just-- just get in the car. [music playing] OK. [knock] [scream] JACKIE: Do male bids have dicks? I was going to name it. But I didn't know which sex to choose. I'm, uh-- I'm Hue. I'm fixing some stuff for Conor. You any good with cables? [music playing] OK. Tape this one. Get the hell out of here. [nail gun fires] [grunts] [nail gun fires] [nail gun fires] [nail gun fires] [screams] [grunting] [rat squeaking] [stomping] [squishing] [grunts] Ah. Ah. You want some? It will help calm you down. You got any pain killers for Christ's sake? You know, Conor and I used to look at each other like we were in love. Oh, man. Come on. What the hell, Jack? Why didn't you take him to the hospital? JACKIE: I'm sorry. I didn't know. I can't drive right now. What? Oh, shit. JACKIE: God. Relax. You're harshing my mellow. CONOR: Jack, shut up. HUE: Hey! Hey! ADDISON: Are you harshed by anything else? HUE: Everyone, calm down. I'm-- I'm numbing up fine. ADDISON: God dammit. That means it's working. Should I take him to the hospital? Yeah. ADDISON: How far is the hospital from here? Five minutes. 30 minutes. It depends which hospital. ADDISON: Come on. Let's go. It's OK. Come on. [grunts] Sh. Quiet. Quiet. Quiet. It's OK. Come on. It's cool. I've got it. God, is that my dress? - Yeah. I'm sorry. ADDISON: What the fuck is wrong with you? I was playing dress-up, [music playing over radio] ADDISON: God, I can't believe she was wearing my dress. I can't even remember when I last wore that thing, you know? Last New Years maybe. [knocking] Come in. Hey. ADDISON: Hey. You want a hit? Um, look, I'm sorry to bother you. But, uh-- Has anyone ever told you, you look a little like Jane Mansfield? ADDISON: No. I don't even know who that is? JACKIE: She was a pin-up girl. ADDISON: Was she blonde? Yeah. ADDISON: Yeah. OK. No, thanks. Look, I want to talk to you about-- Would you-- would you please just put it on? Would you at least take a hit and think about it? [music playing] [chuckles] [music playing] [SINGING] Strip me down. Break me down, I said. [camera shutters] Oh, I like your legs. I like your legs, man. No. No. They're too muscular. JACKIE: No, you're a dancer. That's a good thing. Do you think Conor likes my legs? I'm sure he does. ADDISON: Do you think he likes my legs as much as yours? I mean-- [chuckles] I mean, do you think that he likes my legs as much as he likes your breasts? [chuckles] Do you think maybe they're competitive in his mind? I-- I'm sure he prefers-- ADDISON: Look, I know that you guys sleep together. OK? I've known about it for months. But-- but, um, do think that he likes sleeping with me better? JACKIE: Why? Wait. Don't-- don't you care? Oh, yes, I do. Ah. CONOR: Jesus, Add. Come on. I'm tired. I'm going to leave tonight in your sleep. You're barely going to notice. You know when you're a kid and you really want to run down the stairs as fast as you can, but your dad won't let you? And so you cry, or you mope, or whatever, until he finally agrees as long as you hold his hand. And then you take off running as fast as you can. You're five steps to his one. And then you loose footing. And your heart skips a beat. And your stomach hurts. And you think that you're going to crash down and hurt yourself. But then you realize that you're being held up by him. And he just looks down and smiles as your feet stop running and you stand steady. You know that feeling? [laughs] CONOR: Um, well, gee, Add. I mean, it seems specific. Yeah. Well, I never felt that with you. Even at our best, my feet never dangled. I just crashed every time. And you taught me how to behave. And how to kiss. And how to fuck. And how to take care of you. And I became exactly what you wanted. And then you started throwing me away. And now I'm ruined. I'm a fraction of a person-- the part people wish they didn't have. [music playing] [air conditioner humming] Oh, hey. You want to ride the roller coaster? I'm going. See you later. [droning music playing] CONOR [VOICEOVER]: What will you miss the most? ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: I don't know. Don't you get it? You can't live outside this moment. I'm sure there will be some miserable day where I'll miss you all the time forever. But this isn't it. I did not just take care of that. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: I guess I do. ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: Sorry. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: No, it's OK. I was shitty. ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: At least you have that attitude today. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: Yeah. Hey, can I bum one? Yeah. Thank you. [music playing] So where are you from? Um, a small town in West Virginia. [coughs] Where are you from? Here. That guy that gave you the cigarette before-- he was flirting with you, right? You know those couples that drag it out, that fight, and bicker, and read each other's emails? We don't have to be like that. We should just ease out of this and become like echoes that grow fainter and fainter. Kind of sounds miserable, doesn't it? [music playing] [tatto pen buzzing] ADDISON: I'm going to run away with the circus. I'm going to travel from tent to tent walking tightrope and maybe smelling like popcorn and cotton candy. [laughter] And sleeping on hay stacks. Oh, man. That sounds a lot more far fetched when I say it out loud. [chuckling] Well, if you take out the colored tents and the tightrope, you just explained my Saturday night. [chuckles] Hey, look. [chuckling] Conor, stop it. You're not leaving, Add. You're not. Conor, stop it. Go away. [grunting] Stop it. Get off me. [grunting] Come on, Conor. Stop. [grunting] God. [smacking] Come on. Get off. So aren't you going to come to bed? I mean, you are going to have to sleep sometime. I don't feel like it yet. [music playing] [air conditioner humming] [soft music playing] ADDISON: Sorry. Um, I was thinking. Yeah. Yeah, me too. I mean, I-- I-- I've been thinking too. Um, me first? ADDISON: I think we're going to die like this. Our hair is going to lose color. And our skin is going to get all loose. Do you feel older? ADDISON: Yeah. I do feel a few days older than I did a few days ago. CONOR: We should go back. I mean, to the way things were, you know? I mean, before-- before everything just got so fucked up, you know what I mean? I could be better, try harder. I-- ADDISON: Yeah. We could do a lot of things. I could be more spontaneous, more sincere. ADDISON: I could be less fickle and flighty. No, you're fine. ADDISON: No. I've been shitty too. No, it's fine. I-- I just-- I mean, I-- I just-- I wish we could stay here, you know? At least until we figure all this shit out, you know? You know, tomorrow could come. And-- and you're just so set on leaving. And I mean, I-- ADDISON: Conor, I want the blame. Well, I'm taking 51%. ADDISON: No, I've been shitty. I'm taking the 51%. - OK, fine. Well, then it's out of 103. All right? [sigh] ADDISON: What do you feel worst about? I don't know. I mean, yeah, I know. But you know what, if possible-- I mean, if at all possible, I'd really rather not go into any new areas, you know, risk giving you new material, and then-- I-- I just-- I think we should stay, settle down, and just-- ADDISON: And I'll try you out again? Yeah. ADDISON: And you'll make me regret it? But the pushing, and the pulling, and this needing, and not wanting-- it's all going to keep happening. And what do you want exactly? I really don't understand the scope of your question. [droning music playing] CONOR [VOICEOVER]: So this is our day? Our purgatory? There one goes ahead and behind. We just sit here and think the same things forever. ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: There was also days that we'd fight, and the days that we made love, and then the day we met. And we live them all every day. They must exist somewhere. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: Tomorrow, you'll be further from me. ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: It doesn't matter I guess though because we don't get to see that. Hi. Hi. Could you, um, get me some-- Ice water? Yeah. Yeah, of course. Thanks. You're welcome. [trickling] I think I should get an abortion today-- you know, seeing as we're fixing things that are broken. Con, this isn't real. None of this is real. The circumstances aren't right for that. I don't think you can just walk in there without an appointment though. I mean, I think people tend to set that kind of thing up in advance. ADDISON: I know a guy who knows a guy. Oh, what's the worst that could happen, right? Come on. Let's go. Are you going to close the window? CONOR: No. I'm really sick of cleaning up dead birds. [music playing] [chuckles] Hell, no. We're not driving this piece of shit to go see Rhino. We'll take my rig. I, uh-- I know a short cut. Oh, honey. You'll drive. I've been drinking all day. Conor, you can ride in the back. Yeah, go ahead. Wale the kid up. Tap the break. Do it. He'll be fine. OK. [bump] [laughing] [knocking] CONOR: Thanks, guys. Real nice! So is it a painful procedure? I mean, it's a procedure, right? HUE: Are you scared? Do you think I should be? HUE: I'd be scared if I were you-- riding around in a truck with a stranger, going to a guy named Rhino's house to have a perfectly legal procedure done illegally. Bet you never dreamed you'd be doing this when you woke up this morning, did you? No. I-- I didn't. Oh, no, thank you. Smoke won't hurt him. You think it's a him? He'll be expecting this. It's, you know, no big deal. He's-- he's probably got something cooked up for you and everything. Hey, we'll wait in the car. OK? OK. Maybe a little music. No, thank you. You know, I was going to leave Conor tonight. HUE: You know, I'm not so good at this kind of stuff. I always say I'm going to leave him, but I never do, you know? You know, sometimes it's better to do what's right for someone else, even if it's not right for you. ADDISON: Hue said I'm going in alone. It's OK. I'm a big girl. What if you're not OK? I mean, what if something happens? Then you'll to relive today over and over again without me. Or tomorrow. One day at a time, right? Can I help in any way? I should get an abortion every day with attention like this. [soft music playing] You know, Con, I'm tired of getting the fuzzy end of the lollipop. I can see right through the ceiling-- right into your bedroom. You're chasing around some girl you think you love. You're thinking you're losing her and that you'll be stuck in the surf. Well, if you're listening with your ear pressed to the floor, then you should know I'll stick myself in the surf with you. I wrote a poem for you today. For most of us, there's only that unattended moment-- the moment in and out of time; the distraction fit blasted in a shaft of sunlight; the wild time unseen; or the winter lightning; or the waterfall; or the music heard so deeply that it isn't heard at all. Because you are the music while the music lasts. If you really are listening, then I'm so, so sorry. I didn't actually write that. [muffled music playing] [long sigh] Hello? Is anybody here? You bleed longer than a week, you're going to call me. We'll get you to a proper doctor. This is not the kind of thing you wait on, you understand? [SOFTLY] Yeah. With. Conor. Conor, come on. [groaning] Conor, please. I need you. Conor. [SOFTLY] God. God. [groaning] Ah! [heavy breathing] [grunting] Will you cum in me? I promise I won't get pregnant. Cross my heart. [music playing] [air conditioner humming] [trickling] Hey. [lightly knocking] Hey. Oh, man. You know, Conor, I really needed you last night. I was really sick. I mean, what? Were you fucking Jackie? Huh? You just couldn't wait for that? Just for, like, one night? Huh? Say something. How long have you known? I don't know. Months maybe. Hey. What? It's nothing, you know? It's nothing. She's just a bad habit. I mean, low-hanging fruit or whatever. I don't know. I mean, it doesn't mean anything. Conor. Come on. That's the most disgusting thing you've ever said. I mean, you could have said something sooner, you know? ADDISON: What? I couldn't have said something sooner? Really? Yeah, I don't know. Yeah, maybe. I mean-- God! God, I just-- CONOR: We wouldn't have ended up here. Oh, man. Yesterday, I'm thinking that I have you back. And then I guess it's just one of your-- oh! You're insecure bullshit moves, right-- those ones where you think that you can get me back. And then you do. And then-- then-- you know what, fuck it! Hey. Add. Add. Fuck. Addison! [muffled music playing] Add! Shit. Add, come on! Add, just wait, all right? Hey, come on, Add! Just stop the car! Fuck. Add! Come on. I was doing good yesterday, right? [music playing over radio] Add, stop the car. Add, come on. Please just stop the car. Shit. Add, come on! You know it's-- fuck. [feet pattering] Add? [music playing] [knocking] JACKIE: Oh, hey, Con. What are you doing? Add is leaving me tonight. Oh? CONOR: Yeah. JACKIE: Conor. [laughs] OK. Listen. I need you to play along. All right? I mean, like, I need you to play along right now. All right? Even if you don't believe me, I need you to say, Con, I fucking believe you. I totally believe you. This day has-- has-- has been repeating itself. OK? I mean, like this exact same day, every day, for-- for-- for-- for several days, I mean, may-- maybe even a week. I-- you know? I don't know. I don't know. And-- I believe you. Yeah? JACKIE: Yeah. So why is Add leaving you? [grunting] Do we do this every day? Only sometimes. Am I going to feel bad after it? I wouldn't know that. If we keep doing this, would you make me say something really sweet after, like that you will love me until the end of tomorrow-- you know, sort of like a play on words or something? Sure. But would it be true? [breathing] I-- I don't know. You know, you really picked a strange time to fucking talk about this. Yeah, I was thinking the same thing. [music playing] [air conditioner humming] [glass shatters] Someone fucking stole my moped. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: Do you wish you had left differently? [droning music playing] ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: Yeah, maybe. But you know how these things go-- once you are far enough away, you just stop thinking about that. [music playing] [SINGING] Dressed in our sleeping clothes. Twisted in all [inaudible]. I still see your face-- or maybe I'm just wishing it. Did you lose what you couldn't find? Hope springs with your back against the wall. In the dog days of our minds. Did you get back? Did you get back? Did you get back to your old divinity? And you left us just swimming in the trees. And it's not forgotten. Give me a radio. Give me your hopes that I can sink. [droning music playing] ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: The best thing about getting comfortable with you was how you stopped noticing the things you used to love about me. They just kind of became me. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: Maybe I took you for granted. It happens to everyone, right? ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: At least we both did it at the same time. [music playing] Oh, how I love you now. Though the years divide us, I see you still. Stars forming through your eyes again, again, again, again. Did you lose what you couldn't find? Hope springs with your back against the wall. ADDISON: What's the nicest thing you do for me? When you get out of the shower and your hair is all wet. And then you come to bed. And you lie down. And then you realize you forgot something in the bathroom. So I switch pillows with you so that your pillow is dry. You like how fresh mine smells. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: Well, when you come home late and I sleep on your side of the bed. And then when you get home, I-- I roll over and-- and give you the other side so that you don't have to sleep on the cold sheets. ADDISON: You like the cold sheets. It's kind of the same thing. CONOR [VOICEOVER]: OK. Well-- all-- all right. Well, what about when I get up in the morning and I-- and I go into the kitchen and I put on a pot of coffee for you? I mean, because, you know, I-- I don't drink your coffee. I mean, I cannot stand that shit. I mean, that's pretty nice, right? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah, that's pretty nice. Hey. Um, can I have a large coffee? Where the fuck are my shirts? No sugar? No, thanks. Hey, did you hurt your chin? Just a shave. Nothing big. Oh, I'm sorry. Milk or sugar? Big flea markets tomorrow. Add and I used to go every year. We can chase her if you want. CONOR: I feel like I'm fucking shrinking-- like, I'm just some memory of hers that keeps getting smaller every day. Well, if you keep shrinking, who is going to remember me? [music playing] [air conditioner humming] Go to that place behind the houses. I don't see what's strange about this. Tiny bubbles hang above me. It's a sign that someone loves me. I can hardly stand up right. In my head, upon the light, I have faith, but don't believe it. It's not there enough to leave it. Everything I love is on the table. Everything I love is out to sea. I have only two emotions-- careful fear and dead devotion. I can't get the balance right. I'll throw my marbles in the fight. I see all the ones I went for, all the things I had it in for. I won't cry until I hear, because I was not supposed to be here. Everything I love is on the table. Excuse me. What? CONOR: Where did you get these clothes? [SINGING] I'm not alone. I'm never beaten to the bone. I'm evergreen. I'm tired of freezing. I'm done. But I guess I'll lay it out to get everyone. I need somewhere to stay. I don't think anybody knows me. Come down. It's all right. Keep my arms the rest of the night. When they ask, what do I see, I say, a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me. Excuse me. Hi. Sorry. Uh, do you know how far ahead Tokyo is? WOMAN: Um, it's going to be, like, a day ahead. How much for these? WOMAN: I can do, like, five apiece. And if you want to see me cry-- Thanks. --play "Let It Be." I'm never mad. There's a time to need. There's a time to think about, what do I want to say to the girls at the door. I need somewhere to be, but I can't get around the river in front of me. Come down. It's all right. Bleed my arms the rest of the night. When they ask, what do I see, I say, a bright, white, beautiful heaven hanging over me. I'm not alone. I'm never beaten to the bone. I'm evergreen. And if you want to see me cry, play "Let It Be." I'm never mad. [droning music playing] CONOR [VOICEOVER]: Well, maybe this is all bullshit and we're just making this out to be easier than it is. Maybe every day happens and then barely gets remembered, and we just think here, out loud, that this second really matters. Maybe there isn't a day where Conor and Addison still exist. ADDISON [VOICEOVER]: There has to be. I think there has to be. I think there has to be. [ECHOING] I think there has to be. [music playing] You've got eyes like a candlestick and a painted face I could not resist. Oh, step outside. I've got a light. I fall in love all the time. Morning is not very far away. So we might as well try to stay away. Oh, step outside. The sun will shine. I fall in love all the time. Sure, there's a calm when you are near me. Sure, there's a flutter in my heart. And sure, my love, it can endear me. And I am sad when we're apart. Oh, it's not my fault. I blame the wine. But I fall in love all the time. I fall in love all the time. [ECHOING] I fall in love. [ECHOING] I fall in love. [ECHOING] I fall in love. [ECHOING] I fall in love. [ECHOING] I fall in love. [ECHOING] I fall in love. [ECHOING] I fall in love. You've got eyes like a chimpanzee and a rising tide that will not recede. Oh, step aside or get in line. Because I fall in love all the time. Yeah, I fall in love all the time. I fall in love all the time. I fall in love all the time.
