Since I was 14 or 15, I started a few times to write a personal diary. But that was all. I never managed to keep at it even for a few weeks. Today, I've decided to write. As one sees, I've picked up my pen here in my apartment in Berlin. I begin with my arrival in Germany, in Essen. As I have to begin there. I think it wasn't so good. We should do it again. We can do it still better. Let's do it again. One fine day... Fecioara, let me do it! - No! Go! Is this in Essen? - Yes, in Essen. When we lugged in the furniture. Slowly. We'd finally arrived in Germany from Romania. The first goal had been achieved. Philip came for a visit. He asked me if he could film. I said it would be okay. While he was here, he filmed all that he found interesting. Show me, a mirror? I'll wear make-up every day. - You're nuts. But why, my mirror's great! I think it's nice like this. We're settling in. As if it had taken hours! As if Zefir did it all by himself. Great, screwed on the chair leg all by himself! There is no water. There he can see how we started out here. Our whole life. We're constantly starting over. That's my brother-in-law Zefir. My sisters Lulughia and Fecioara with Creatia, Rata and Ecstasy. This is me. And Philip, and Gica. The camera is a gift to capture our beautiful memories. This is my son Casino. And my daughter Noami, who received the camera so she can film every day. Like a diary. I'm in Germany. I had a fantastic day today. It's my birthday in 10 days. Then I'll be 12 years old and do as I please! Happy Birthday already! My God, she's excited and wild. Today was great, now we're going home. We'll eat and drink. And do great things all day. We'll jump on the bed and fool around. He edited out "We'll break into people's homes". Well done. What faces we're making! Sorry... It's my fault. I'm still asleep, you're disturbing me! The first night was okay. We woke up early in the morning. At least we had an apartment to retire to. But nothing worked. There was only one tap and the toilettes were unusable. An unpleasant situation. Three families lived in two apartments with no less than 15 children. And the fourth young family was awaiting their first child in a few days. Life in Essen. That was on the 27th, when we signed the rent contract. And moved from Essen to Berlin. The day... - ...of the move. When we arrived in Berlin. It looks like in an Indian film here. Looks like it. Beautiful. I'm an Indian and make films all day. You really look like an Indian. The area is really very beautiful. Would be nice to live here. Really like in the films. Look, hens. Would be nice to come here on the weekend for a barbecue. Yes, but we couldn't live here. Why? Because the people here go to bed at 8pm, and then it's quiet. We'd make noise, it'd be difficult for us. You always see people at our place, there's noise and voices. Very well said. And you? You've nothing to say? A new start in Berlin. Meanwhile, I phoned my wife Teodora every day. Soon after I left, she was transferred to Targşor. There's been total chaos since the change in the criminal law. I'd hope there would be something in it for Teodora. If yes, she could come home to us in 2 months. You're all here finally! - Yes, all of us. The new apartment. You have to air the place. Here is the toilette. Fecioara, where is our front garden? The courtyard here is for everyone. But we have a park right across. Come on, let's go there now. Delivery room Sounds like a siren. He's here! Can we see him? You're a father now! You have responsibility. Not like in the past. Today on 25th March, I've become great uncle. The wife of Jackiechan, the son of my sister, at whose birth I was present 19 years ago, has delivered a healthy child. The first Berliner in our family. She is in another room now. The delivery was so quick. So he finally has something to say too! You have a grandson now. It's a boy! - Super! You're always there. Don't want to miss a thing. And who does he look like? Constanța! How still he lies and looks! Good luck! God protect your mother, father and grandmother. Same to you. God willing. This is just too much. Crazy. I think he is beautiful. - The nose maybe, but only the nose... What a gadje-face. Incredible. - He has huge eyes. Look, Jackie - his hair is like Jackiechan's. The nose looks alike. It's a case of mistaken identity! What does he want from us, he's far too white. White as snow, and endless long fingernails. Impossible, so white! Come here Jackiechan, look at this. How are you? - Good. Congratulations. - Thanks. Much bigger! Really far bigger! - Yes, much bigger. He's doing really well. - Yes. Is that the film? It's a 15-minute montage from our material. He's shown it to others. They like it, and now we should make the film. We talked about our film. Philip and Merle asked us whether we want to continue to work on it. My answer was: Yes. They really should eat something. After we'd talked about it and after Merle and Philip had left, we began to make plans for the film. He's doing that for the first time. That's when I tried it for the first time. But one can see that you've watched many films. Yes, I like the Shaolin and Jackie Chan films. Even as a young boy it was like that. Are you filming me? - Yes of course. Now we're here in England, in central London. And we want to film something nice. Why are you here in England, in London? I'm visiting my cousins here in London. I'm here for two very important things: Firstly, I have something to resolve with someone here. And secondly: I have to buy a car and drive home. So you have to resolve something. What do you mean? Business? That I can't tell you. It's about an old acquaintance. I can't talk about it in public. It's about something that means a lot to you? I'll tell you in private but no one else must know. Hey cousin! I've something to ask of you. I've heard that you sing well. Sing a beautiful song for my sweetheart. I'm crazy about her. I will. Ready? - Ready. I heard that you have a problem with me? I swear, I'll slab you! If you have a problem with me, then come here. If I had one with you, I would pursue you right across Europe. If you have a problem with me, come here and we'll fight! I swear I'll make mincemeat of you. Turn it off. Go on, sit down. No, wait. Like this. Don't talk to me this way. I swear on my mother: Here I am! Calil, fetch me a glass of water. What do you want? I'm getting water for Casino. Someone is always ordering someone around here. Go on, I'll be right there and talk to them. How often have I said: When I return from work, I don't want to see a mess here. Sit quietly. Be quiet, don't laugh, okay? Did you hear me? I thought he's really talking to us like that. Don't look there. Do your things here. That's good. Do your homework, Noami. Yes, papa. And be quiet and play. At least you be good. Many days have gone by since I last wrote. I only return home from work at 5:30pm. Sometimes I'm tired or have things to take care of. Often I have no peace of mind. That's why I don't always have time to write. I found this letter in the mailbox. Good if it were from the bank. Berliner Volksbank. The card has arrived, yesterday the TAN numbers. Now I'm waiting for the Pin Code. Papa, this is my camera, isn't it? No, it's not yours. A maestro card. I hope it brings me luck. Dear people and Roma! We have come here to Berlin. For Easter, we're here in a park, having a barbecue. We're all here, my entire crew, you see? All the people and Roma should see that we're doing well. We're digging in like the hajduci. If it were better elsewhere, I wouldn't be here. How do I zoom into the image? Press the screen and then with your finger! Am I in it? So, Rata? Well, I'm here in Germany. Where? Here in the park. A very beautiful park. Are you filming me? Film over there. Wail, let me tell you something. I was in the city centre with Jackiechan, on a terrace. Where you're served properly. Both of us ordered a great cocktail, real classy. I pestered Jackie to buy me shrimps. They had some. They looked so good! So Jackie ordered some and a huge pizza for himself. But he kept saying: "You can't even eat properly". I really couldn't... No, I just didn't want to! It was embarrassing for you as Romni... Yes, I'm Romni and I wanted to eat my way. But sure I could and ate properly with a knife and fork. I ate in an orderly and civilised manner. And he: “You can eat properly!” - And I: “Well, you see!” Hardly a second later, I wanted the ketchup. My arm hit the cocktail, and it poured all over his pizza and the entire table. That was something! And what did he say? - He was confused. Something like: "You're driving me crazy!" He was embarrassed. But he said nothing, out of respect for me. Very strange. Better he doesn't go out with you anymore. Hang on, I'll sing something. What should I sing? I'll sing an original Roma song. Do you know which one? - Which one? This one: "Gelem, Gelem." Are you filming me? Should I press the red button? - No, let it be. Beautiful. - God be with you. Where is Mario? - At home. On the computer? - Yes. I'll take it from him. - That would be good. Why didn't you tell me that you're here? You wanted to film me at the entrance? Would you have told us, Mario, that it's you? I'm just returning from work. - What did you do today? What can I say; I'm slowly becoming a real pro. One can see that, look! Colour everywhere, on my face, hands. You were doing the painting, yeh? Hang on. I washed myself, but it's still there. All over. Soon you'll be master painter. I painted all day long. You'll soon be doing the finishing coat. I ate rice. I drank a beer and I'm in a good mood and I'm filming. - Then have another drink! Have fun, feel free! Do you know there was a Bollywood casting here? Really? - Dancing to Bollywood music... And you know whose photo was on the cover? The woman from "Om Shanti Om." - Deepika Padukone. And one should act in the music video. Why didn't you say anything, I would have applied! I saw it too late. Also, they don't need men. Now you had me fooled! I don't stand a chance anyway. I'm too white. Where's he from? He's not an Indian! Mario, you always get taken in by my jokes. What's wrong with you? I'm just not used to your style. If it were you brother, his jokes I know better. And you, Noami? Maybe they'll doing a casting and you'll become a star! But not with this hairdo. But it looks good now. Only one thing's missing: a bra. Why are you sad, Parica? He's listening to music. But only with one ear. He has only one earphone on. We're in Germany since exactly 3 months. We applied for child benefits in the very first month. I've received nothing so far. Who knows how long it'll still take. When was the last time you showered, Calil? Pull up the table a bit. My salary should have been in my account on Tuesday. I went to the bank but the money still wasn't there. We were supposed to pay the rent on the first. We still haven't been able to do it. Who put the mug there? Did you put it right in front? You always do stuff like that. Papa's worked up again. But he's right: We sit around all day at home. Come, let's go out, to the park. Okay, let's go. Casino, what do you think about our life in Germany? It was great at the start. But not for long. Why was it good at the start? - Everyone went to the west. It was the first time for me. I was never here before. I could also hardly wait. And now... I miss my neighbourhood. The house, friends, family. Casino, we've had good times since we've been here. But it's rather boring now. Because we hang out at home too much. We still haven't found any friends like at home. Let's go to Alexanderplatz, it's abuzz with activity. I didn't say it right. Never mind. Don't stop, we continue. I was meeting Philip at 6pm. He suggested that I read from my dairy. I should read and he wanted to film. It took some time to set up the light, sound and image. Then it was only the two of us in the room. He filmed and I actually read from this diary. As Philip saw no one from Zefir and Lulughias family, he asked why they hadn't come. He was hugely disappointed to hear that they left for Spain yesterday. He said it would've been better to have met two days earlier. He'd have had the chance to film their departure. He should have reckoned with it. Some things are easier for us in Spain. We've all been there and we get by with our Spanish. It you find work in the fields, the entire family can work there. Still, I don't understand why they left now. Now that we're slowly making progress. No one says anything while filming? What do you say, Casino? Look, that's why I'm like this. The food all goes straight here, here and here. That was my speech. And when you come to Germany: it's paradise on earth! What do you say, Mario? I'm trying to survive. What? - I'm trying to survive. Where do you think you are? In the jungle? Do you have to be in the jungle if you're trying to survive? Is life here the same as in the jungle? Hold it, Parica! You film. Have a go at being cameraman. What do you say, Mario? You're saying nothing? I was taking a nap today. Mario and Parica came in. Mario had a letter in his hand, comprising several pages. It was the long awaited letter from the Family Benefits Office. He found it in his mailbox and brought it to me. I went through it. They wanted more things and a few forms filled in. I'd reckoned with certain things, not with others. Suddenly Mario said that he was ready to leave. Today or tomorrow. Only now you come in here. Are you preparing your departure? - Yes. So you're going to Spain? - Yes, we're going. Where's Mario? - He's downstairs with the luggage. With the children. Looking forward to Spain? - Yes. And what'll you do there? - I'll be there. It'll be more boring there. Without Eldorado, Calil and the park. I have cousins there too. Here's the bag with the phones. Get the keys from Nelu. Put our names on your mailbox so our post can arrive here. Did you get him? - Yes. Go with God and take care. - All the best, drive safely. May we all meet again when we're prospering... I'm going to make you all rich this year! We should meet this summer. Go with God. I want to film now. The mood is very low. All are sad because Mario and Fecioara have left with their children. I won't say it in front of the children to avoid making them sadder. I'll film each one of them individually so you'll see on their faces how sad they are. Where are you going? I found this keepsake of Mario. Where are you going? - We're picking up the mattresses. Doesn't the light work in here? - No, not since a while. Has the bulb blown? - No, but it's still not working. Look: Wrestling. What do you mean, Sara? - Nothing. How are you Papa? Are you still sad? You aren't anymore? Very good. At 9:30pm I went downstairs to refuel the car. Fecioara had left me 50 Euros. She knew I had no money left. Nelu told me about the returnable bottles for 8 Euros that Fecioara had left for the children. That's 2 Euros each for Parica, Casino and Noami. I gave him 5 Euros to buy flour, juice and beer tomorrow. Noami cried earlier on. I scolded her. She's calmed down a bit but is still sad. She's taking it the hardest from us all. Sara was quite upset too. How long since we left Berlin? We're 100kms away from our address in Berlin. We're on the autobahn towards Munich. Our destination is Spain. Barcelona. Badalona to be precise. We'll film our arrival there. Zefir, his wife and children are there. They're working there. They rang us and said that people are still needed. We need the work and are going there as it was difficult for me to find work in Berlin. Since we had very little money, our savings have now been used up. What money is left, we need for the journey. We pray to God that we arrive safely. That the money suffices. We'll film there again. God be with us. We can hardly wait to start working. We'll both work hard in the fields. Let's see what's in season now. Zefir didn't say. I don't even know for how long. It can also be Zaragossa instead of Barcelona. We don't know for how long we'll get work and what we'll harvest. I spoke a bit more with Nelu and Noami in the kitchen. About an hour ago, I came to my room and got down to writing. After 4 months in Germany, only 1 of 4 families is still here. The apartment is quieter than ever before. I'm not sure whether I can make it here alone. Although we're not really alone here. Someone from Craiova is always visiting Berlin. Some are old friends. It you tell a story without setting and context, no one can understand it. Only if you explain later: This is the context and the setting I was referring to. Do you understand? I'm sorry I can't give so many details. I don't focus on it because I generally write in the evenings. I often have to think about something. Besides, I'm not writing a real book. What I did in the last few days has to be described in great detail. One definitely needs 2 to 3 hours for it. Sure, you have to think about how you express something. You take a moment, then you know what you want, you have to think about the language, right? It takes time. For details, you need patience and lots of time. It's different when you write out of passion and when you write a diary. Don't think about it, you simply write a diary. You write about your feelings. How you perceived the situation. You've been writing for a few months, you have the experience. So it's easier to express yourself. As I said, I have to give more details. I'll read out a little of what I wrote last evening. You can also read some more. Do you have secrets? No, but - you'll see, I give a few details, but just a few. I could have focused on it more, but I wrote it all spontaneously. You have beautiful handwriting, Colorado. I have many handwritings, different... I know how you used to write, far messier. You know, on the basis of your handwriting, one can tell what kind of person you are. Partly, but some have no practice. I haven't written much in my life. Only very rarely. At first, I gave a lot of details. We were first at the World Time Clock. For places that I found especially nice, there are far more details. Be quiet. Go to your room. I'm starting here now. Earlier I spoke of the big cathedral in front of which we stood. The one with John and Luke? - Exactly. To the right, there was something like the acropolis, that kind. I've just made up this term. Further behind, there was a structure in Romanic style. We went around the building, took a few photos and went to my favourite building in Romanic style. On the top of the stairs, there was a horse on its hind legs. The statue of Emperor Wilhelm. To the left, you arrived in an enclosed area. When you turned to the impressive cathedral, - I said which one earlier on - you were in a completely different epoch. From this angle, you saw nothing of the modern city. Facing the cathedral, you had the Roman building to the left, which I liked best. The museum was on the right. There a path began, encircled by a magnificent garden. I describe it here because I hadn't mentioned it before. We stood there. The path led to the bank of the canal flowing through the city. A bank toward which just the rear of the big cathedral faces. The garden around us was magnificent. We walked along the path and stopped at the water's edge. We took a 10-15 minute break there. We talked and marveled at all we'd seen. From there, we walked to the car. Four free days that I made full use of. A good time. Really memorable. Beautiful! Here are some details but not as I imagine it. I wasn't free, it was all spontaneous. I didn't consider how I could incorporate details. Do you know what's missing? Your feelings. The impression of your feelings. You should have mentioned them. I mentioned it up earlier and also at the end, very briefly. I couldn't go on, I was tired. But that's why it says here: "Four free days that I fully utilized. A wonderful time, really unforgettable." Have we arrived? We can see Barcelona from here. Still 6 or 7kms to go. I'm filming you! I've landed at Zefir's. Good to see you all. - Welcome! God protect you and bestow health and luck upon you. Film Lulughia in the kitchen. Lulughia is preparing something for us. I have prepared this, this and this. Excellent preparation. Zefir's crew. You're really slaving away this season, yeh? - Yes. Simpatic is the most zealous worker. The month of cherries starts now, then apples and pears. We have at least 3 months of work, right Zefir? 3-4 months until August. The potatoes by September. Here's Rata. Show me the baby! We'll show it to him, then he can see it too! Look! He has grown. Paleface! Their place is nice, isn't it? - Yes. Sara, get down there. Start of the month. Start of summer. A typical morning this time of the year. Lovely, sunny weather. Right now I am so broke as never before. In the past weeks, we've lived on scarcely 150 Euros. On 4th of the month, 616 Euros were on my account. My salary. From it, I paid 500 Euro rent and 116 were left. Today we're lacking almost everything. But it's not so bad. We're still waiting for better times. Times that have seemingly forgotten us. Do you want to film yourself now? Film myself? No, filming us! I'm not here alone. Do you want to test it? Yes, a microphone test. I spoke to Paliser about who would suit our film. With our budget, we can't afford actors. But anyway I like better the idea that family members and friends act in our film. Who's this? Zorro, he's really nice. - Looks like Aramis. Who's this again? Zorro, Präfekt's son. Ah, that's him. He really does look like Aramis. Parica shared this photo. What despairing eyes he has! This one is a boxer. A champion like Lucian Bute. This is how he looks? This is Şerlok Holmes? It's not Şerlok Holmes. It's Francisco. He's the youngest, isn't he? I don't know him. He looks like Rodrigo did earlier. I think he's taller than 1.85 meters. Seriously? That's him? - No, him here above. Him there? - Yes, him. He looks nice. - Yes, quite nice. Truly nice, like an actor. Rodrigo Box. Who's that with the Porsche? Romeo. Crazy, he's lost weight! Which Romeo? - Our Romeo. He looks totally different. The man has no paunch anymore. The man looks perfect. And what arms. He never looked better. Man, this guy needs to lose weight. He looks like a killer, really, that's what you think. How Rodrigo looks here! But he doesn't look bad. What a cool body he has. Look, that's the guy I was telling you about: Tibre. He always called Teodora "Teo." He's really quite special. Oh shit, Atos! You look Japanese! Where did you get the camera? Did you buy it? Is the necklace real? I just bought it. Just bought it? Honestly, is it real? How much did you pay? - The price was 2500. But you paid less? I swapped it for another. Gold plus money. Died hair, new necklace... I'm gifting it to Ion. You should dye your beard the same colour. Then you'll look... - like a black guy? What's got into you? I'm like Nazdravan, the guy who films everything. How are you? - Good. Children, family, all well. And you, you've lost weight. You've lost a lot of weight. Did you do a diet? I jog and go easy on the food. Paliser, are you here with your children? No, but my family will follow soon... That would be great... You look like someone from "The Devil Wears Prada!" The Devil Wears Prada? Don't you know the film? - Oh, a film! Of course you aren't like in the film. You're real! How could it be any different... I knew it, he doesn't talk nonsense. Do you want to work with Colorado? He's worked there since day one. If I had the chance, I would come with my family. Come here, man! That would be paradise! Will you stay here? Sure, I'm staying here. - Not this constant to and fro. The running around is quite exhausting. But I won't backtrack anymore, only look ahead. And it's great here. Compared to Ireland, there is wealth here. You get by here with your English? Yes, at times I meet people who speak English. I want to film him coming out of the shop. I'll make you all actors, Paliser, really big stars. Famous actors? I'll make you famous actors. From your lips to God's ears. You're our director. Metaxa! Good? - Yes! What do you think, Paliser? - Very good. Even if the situation at home were okay, I have to think of the children. It's better to stay in the west. It's only getting worse in our country. Hold the phone over there so the music is heard in the background. The step I took to come here after 13 years in Ireland... That is something, although - One can't hear you anymore! I'll continue as long as I can. Although it seems impossible to me. But I'll continue, always looking ahead. God help me make it my home here. You definitely want to live here? - Yes I'll stay here. Nothing's impossible for him. He always manages. If someone really wants something, has set his mind on it, if he tries hard, then he'll achieve it all. The plan for the family, for the future and also one's faith. God give me patience and more patience. Patience to continue to stay here and to continue what I began. There's my name: Casino. The weekend is over. Finally tomorrow Casino and Noami will go to school. It took nearly 6 months for the letter from the education authority to arrive. Eldorado, Calil and Rebeca have to wait longer as there aren't any free places for them in the district. And they're not allowed to go to another district. It's all so complicated. I don't know if I have enough patience. I don't know how to turn it off. Can you tell the boss that I'll be at work at 8 or 9? Call me when the other bosses arrive. Going to school? - Yes. You're going to another school. You and your brother. We're going to another school? - Yes. I'll go wash my face. Noami! How do you feel about going to school? Are you excited? It feels great, but I'm ashamed to speak before the class. Why? You don't have to be ashamed. It'll get better with time, you know? Don't go away after school. Meet Casino. Wait for Nelu. He's picking you up. Did you hear me? Don't you have a scarf? I'll pull up the collar, it's not cold in the classroom. I won't go out in the break. Is that our Mediamarkt there? Yes, look, that's the Mediamarkt. Go on, out with all of you. I don't know, since 3 days I have a sensitive heart. Somehow I like it. In such moments, I feel far more intense compassion for others. Although I'm more sensitive than I should be. All that the children say to me, moves me to tears. The mood was good at work today. Eldorado arrived this morning and asked whether he could go to school too. Nelu, I told the teacher today that my name is Izadora. She said: Izadora. 2 is pronounced as an S. She said Izadora correctly. But she wanted me to add something. Something like: I, Izadora... Or something like that. I am Izadora. Straight ahead from here and we're there. I know the shop there. You know it? She said I should buy all kinds of things. But I can't remember what. Why didn't you make a list? I wrote down something but it didn't work. It didn't work? What are you supposed to buy? A notebook, a big book. I have to go to the library, I don't know what I should do there. But I did understand a lot. You'll learn step by step. In two months, I'll be really good. I'm a quick learner. Right. And then you can teach us everything. I brought the milk and bread. Already? What time is it? - Two. That was quick. I didn't notice how the time flew. Did you weep again? Watch your step on the stairs! Noami, coming with me to buy a kebab? I have five Euros. No. Okay, then give me money. - Come in now. Hallo Philip. I'm good. Did he come back with you from school? What? - Was he with you in school? Who? - Philip. Yes. In which school were you? - In a red-white one. Shift into the third gear, Nelu. The third? - The third. You're in the fifth. - That's the fifth? Today we have something to celebrate in the family. This morning we received authorisation for child benefits. Next week I expect an answer from the job centre. Let's hope it's a positive one. If not, we'll continue to fight. We now have a basis. In a few days, I'll travel home. Finally, I'll be free of the debts that are stressing me. And I'll see Teodora again. Hey, film this. Throw it back in. Parica! Hey, Parry! Listen to this melody. I worked on it for 2 to 3 days. How do you like the song? - It's very beautiful, I like it a lot. Like it? - Like it very much. I thought we'll do a song about a true story from Fata Luncii. Let's see if we can do it. That's a good idea. Okay. Hello, here we are! What's wrong with you? Aren't you coming in? We've only just arrived! Come here, my little one! How are you, Paradis? - Good. You're pulling in your stomach? Like your papa! This is the Strada Fata Luncii. It gets its name from the area in which we live in Craiova. This is the Strada Fata Luncii, where I live. Good lo see you! Good health and long life lo all of you! To you and your family too, good health and best wishes! 100 years of happiness! - To you too. With all my heart, I'm happy to see you. That you're healthy and strong. Are you here with all the children? No, just with Parica, the eldest, and the girls. We're only staying for a few days. You're not staying long? - No, I'm not. God grant you health and happiness. - To you and your children too. God willing your wife will return home soon. From your lips to God's ears. How are you? - Good. Tell us, when will your wile return? What can I say, I think she'll return in 2-3 months. And you live in Germany? Yes, I live there. Are the two little girls with you? No, all three. The little ones and Noami. The older one? - Yes. You're doing a good job. God grant you health and happiness. - To you too. And your children and grandchildren. Joy and happiness, my boy. After we arrived in Romania, we first drove to Craiova. Today we're visiting Teodora in Targşor close to Ploiesti. We're here already and are waiting to be allowed inside. Did you wake up Rebeca? How did it go today with mama? - Good. Better film from this direction. We're now returning from Teodora. We brought her food and spent 2 hours with her. She was very happy to see us. We had important talks. She is doing well. She is healthy. She looks great! Now we've stopped here and are eating the rest, which we weren't allowed to take inside. It tastes good, we were hungry. Teodora was very happy to see us after such a long time. She hugged and kissed all the children. She undoubtedly suffered at the thought that in the last 3 years, her children have grown up and live so far away from her. I could see all this in her eyes. I didn't want to let it become too emotional, it was to be pleasant for everyone. She had tears in her eyes as we left. What's up, Parica? On the occasion of my birthday, we're going to Sohodol. Me, uncle Leo, papa - just us. We should not forget that we're going to Sohodor, the most beautiful holiday location in Oltenia. It has an ice-cold river, in which you must take a dip! It's mandatory to go into the river! And when you come out, you can drink chilled wine and nothing will happen to you. Tocaito! Oh, it's starting to rain. Come, further! Tocaito! You've developed a deep voice. Where are you? That was a car. Hey, Tocaito! But look! Philip will really like this. Who? - Philip. This will be in the film, this he'll keep. We found you! My goodness, they've done it up really well. The others wanted to give up. But I said: No, we'll go on, we'll find them! Really, it's great here. I think I'll leave for home tomorrow morning. For Berlin. If nothing comes up, that's what I'll do. The thought makes me happy. A lot of nice things await me there. Our apartment, work, acquaintances and friends. And not least the atmosphere there. Maybe everything will become normal again. And the main thing is: Teodora will come home in the next months. No, look, this part here. It's a song that Parica and I wrote. A song I've thought about a lot. A real story like it happens to us, us Roma in Fata Luncii. Actually it's also inspired by my own life. And then I thought: We'll make a song out of it, I've finished a few verses of this story from Fata Luncii. On the love between two young people. How a young man fights to marry a woman who he likes and loves deeply. He fights with her family because they're against it. She understands this and as she loves him deeply too, she knows that her only chance is to run away and to be free, possibly in Berlin. We're in Badalona. There's a festival here in the area. I don't know what exactly. Zefir says it takes place every week: you dance, sing, eat. It's your turn next! You're up next. What should they still dance? Why don't you be quiet? Why do you ask such things? Just shut up. Back off, I'm her manager. Will you choose the music? - Which song? I'm the manager. I have to make myself presentable first. I'm Creatia's manager. We'll present her shortly. Do you think it's okay like this? Isn't it lovely like this? I think in a year you'll watch us in a film that will be released in Berlin. - In Berlin? Yes. A film about our family. We're working on it now. What we're filming now will be in the film. Closer! They're too far apart. Creatia and Ram's debut. I'll make them big stars. I'll get rich with them. Are you talking for Philip? I am Philip. Back off Zefir, let me be director. Alright? - Okay The second part is good. But I don't like the first part. Until the refrain. What don't you like? What's missing? I just think he can do it still better. Far better. Sing with more depth. With vibrato, but without shouting. A little softer, and not too loud. It's all firming up gradually. We're working on the title song of the film. The shooting of the music clip will soon begin. Only Creatia's missing now. Zefir told me he would try everything to come with her to Berlin. Action! Hey, get out of the image! Creatia. - Yes, Monsieur. What do you want to be one day? A star, what else? What kind of a star? I want to make films. These great ones, you know? Get lost! Leave us be! She wants to make films! To become a star! Come here, don't listen to them. As actress, it will happen to you often. They throw cola bottles and eggs at you. Come back! Where were you all this time? Shut the door. You have the wrong position. We're not seen. What do you mean? - We weren't visible anymore. That's too close. You stood in front of me. - Go over there. Papa said we should stand like this. Should we stand here at the door? - Stay there. Come over a bit more. One couldn't see us well. This is how you should stand. I'll tell you when to shut the door. What's the matter with you, boys? We're in Italy, in Reggie-Emilia. At my older brother's place. I think this is the last thing we'll film before we send it all to Philip. I want to comment on what we've filmed, on the life that we're leading. We left Romania and came to Essen. We were there for about one month, I don't know exactly how long. Then we moved to Berlin. It was pretty difficult in Berlin. We worked hard to get the papers, to get child benefits and the school registration. It took about two months. They still couldn't go to school because it's so difficult until the papers are ready, the appointments and so on... And then we didn't know what we should live on, we couldn't have continued to live like that. No, I don't like it. I'm not precise enough. We're no longer in such a difficult situation. You have to see that. We're here and thank God and the people who helped us to be in this situation now. Here in Germany. In Berlin. I hope that more people would have these opportunities, those who are in difficult situations. I hope that more Roma children from Fața Luncii had the chance that you have. The chance that we had. The chance to live in Berlin, to go to school here. You'll have a good school, which would never have been possible in school number 13 in Fața Luncii. I repeat: I wish more people had this chance. And we can only appreciate the true value of this chance. Each one of us. And mainly, all of you. For you, it's a real chance for the future. That speech was far too long. In context, it won't be so long. What don't you like again? Are you grumbling again about my acting skills? I phoned Mario and Zefir today. We talked about a lot of things. They've not been doing so well off late. They want to return to Germany with their families, probably to Essen. This afternoon Teodora's lawyer phoned about the next court date. He sounded very optimistic. Me? I don't know what I should believe. Let's listen to it again. Let's see how it turned out. One fine day...
