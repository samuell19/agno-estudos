As you wish, but I hoped you'd come to Tokyo with me It's a fine city, but I hate all great cities When we married I thought you'd come with me Seems you were wrong I'm afraid you'll forget me when I go away I'm too lazy for that - Will you be here when I get back? - I'm not going anywhere - I'm sure I'll find something to do - I have to go. I'll write I want to see the lady of the house - She's not here... - At last Her photographer's here, you'll have to wait I told her you're broke and need to earn some money - I only work so I don't get bored - Best not tell her that This is a strange house You think so? It's a box of surprises Wait till you see the rest of it Don't be shocked by anything One day she decided she'd like a secretary On a whim, just like that - Was she a big star? - I don't know You must call her "Madame" All her other staff are just "miss" But she's "Madame" - Let's hurry up - In front of that light Best be quiet - And the eyes? - Yes, open them slowly Let's sit down Enough - I can't go on - Hold it I'm tired, I'll see you tomorrow Are those real pearls? - Yes, they're real -And you want to work for me? Still, that's your business I don't know if Dina explained But I need someone who is always silent and obedient Not a friend. Someone I pay... ...who has to put up with me because I pay them You see, I always do what I like in my own home I prefer to tell the truth, I find it much easier I do and say what I want. You may have noticed that I can't be around people who disapprove of me Their smug faces, their air of superiority Much better that she says nothing She obeys, and I don't see her or hear her - Think you can manage that? - I can try Now, walk fight over there Go on Now walk back this way Now what should I do? I throw something on the floor and you pick it up Get used to picking up my things, I never do it Go on, pick it up I throw it on the floor again, and you pick it up A little smile wouldn't harm me You will obey me without asking why Do you understand? Think about it and let me know - If you don't like me... - Who said that? You can start now if you want. Wait here for me I have to go now. We'll talk money when I'm back Listen... I like people who use soap and water... I hope you're not clean on top, but underneath... May I? Yes, that seems fine But I'd prefer you to wear a bra Don't worry, I told you I was rude Don't worry about it. She likes you Have a look round, play some records... There's the Television, the bar's over there I'll see you later Coming. You're the new one? My name's Vittorina, and you? Sit down What are you doing? You'll get expensive shoes made by the Madame's own cobbler - Aren't mine suitable? - No, the heel must be higher Give it to me Half a kilo less, see, you did it. - How much do you weigh, Silvia? - 51 - And how old are you? - 26, Madame More than me, but you don't look it Dina tells me you never out your hair - You'll have to show me - Of course, Madame ls it longer than this? No, not that long A delightful wig, isn't it? Better than a dressing gown. Come... - Madame - What is it? The dressmaker... The invoice? - Have you known Dina long? - We played together as children Was she always like this? Like what? Like an idiot Dina isn't like that, Madame, she's had a hard life She's not the only one You wouldn't pity her if you knew what I know... I'm going to be trying something new I'm tired of commanding servants If I told you to cut off all your hair, would that hurt your pride? Do you really want me to cut it? - Would it upset you? - I don't know They're yours, put them on Give them to her You know why I make everyone wear matching shoes? I suppose it's a uniform - An uncomfortable one - Right, but I'm the boss And I have the right to be more comfortable than you Iris. Why are you still here? Get out. You see how big her behind is? To embarrass her, I always make her wear tight clothes Shameless. Now, Silvia, why don't you sleep here? There's a room on the ground floor It'll save you the taxi fare Thanks, you can go You're not really going to stay? It wouldn't be my first job Anyway, I like being a ladies companion I suppose it relieves the boredom But I don't see how you could enjoy it I've never understood why you work, but it's very different here - You see what she's like - She's very difficult I thought you'd never put up with it I have to earn a living... but you? Such beautiful hair - You called, Madame? - Come and help me Aren't they beautiful? Sit down Sometimes you need to touch money... Look. Or it isn't money at all... ...just numbers on a bank statement See? This is real money It's not like signing a cheque I keep this here, as company for me I know, that if I want... ...a whistle, a phone call... the money's there, and I have everything I want Sometimes, I think: how much is a prostitute? 10,000 lira? I can hire a thousand prostitutes for a regiment of soldiers I once fell in love with a man just because he was rich He seemed so handsome When he lost his money he became like all the others The affair continued, but there was no love left It makes me angry how some men look down on a woman... They say we love a man only for his money... But that's all some men have Read it This is the best day of my life. .. Cough? Spoot? What are you saying? You can't even read Come on... Fight back. Come on, defend yourself Come on, come on... Do something. I'll show you I'll show you, I'll beat you like a rug Fight back. Defend yourself You're lazy You're lazy. You're soft. Soft. Useless.... You've seen my mechanical horse? Look here... Saddle up Now you'll see it in action. Are you ready, horse? The Walk... Faster. The Trot. Be a good boy, let's go now The Gallop..... What is it? Can't I make love in peace? What do you want? Wait here Until I've finished Go on, off to your kennel Silvia. Come... In here - Spartaco, send Maria in I need a smoke Light Why that look? It's just convenient ln emergencies when my lover isn't available, and I don't want to wait... - Waiting bores me -And Mafia? I told them when I hired them Get this - she's saving for her dowry 10,000 a time... I found out the price of a 2nd class call girl Spartaco isn't worth any more, he lacks the gift of speech You called, Madame? Give her this From the Madame You see? How many times a month do you make love, Silvia? I don't know Try always to have an answer How many times a month do you make love? Five, six times... It depends That's not much. Practice is important in such things Or you lose the skill, and the will Making love is like eating Understand? You need a constant diet At least three times a week I always keep two lovers So one of them is always available At home, I have Spartaco... For those times when I can't be bothered to talk to anyone This keeps them at arm's length I don't bother with boyfriends and husbands Silvia, wake up... - What do you want? - What's got into you, Silvia? Wake up - I'm tired, what is it? - Get up, the Madame needs you - What time is it? - Two in the morning Get a move on Here she is - Have you ever been spanked? - I'm not sure, I don't think so It's much better to give than receive, trust me Come here Look at us from behind Well? You're both the same size, more or less Perhaps it's the hips Yes, hers are slightly narrower Take off your night dress Her shoulders are narrower... but with clothes on... Yes, with the wig... And she'll be wearing a coat... No-one will know Get the tape measure - Silvia, what size are your hips? - 85 or 86, I don't know Measure her Good, I'm 90, just fatten her up a few centimetres - Can you do that? - Yes, Madame They can shoot the scene with the slap later For now, just fatten her up... Milk and potatoes, good for her skin too You'll be beautiful, firm, luminous No fuss now... No-one's slapping me. And it happens 3 times in the script All for a film I didn't want to make I can't sleep from thinking about it They just had to include that slap, didn't they If that fool Waldman had told me, I'd have torn up the contract You understand what you have to do? I'm to take your place You must look happier, though You're my servant and if I want I could make you do it for free I'll get you a contract as a stand in You'll earn more than you do from working for me You don't really know what it's like to get slapped You know nothing She's never had a taste of it She'll get a taste now Shall I call Spartaco? Don't get too excited Vittorina will do it Vittorina, take care of it, slap Silvia Step forward - How should I do it? - However you like Ready... Now. You call that a slap? Harder. You'll kill her if you carry on like that - Was someone there? - Yes, a beautiful stranger - No, that's just Silvia - ls she an actress too? What's she doing here? You want her? No, I'm just curious So... This Silvia... Who is she? A lunatic, she has a screw loose... I'm doing her a favour looking after her She's a strange one We need to find a way to cure her... - Heal her - Why? ls she ill? Perhaps She looks at herself in mirrors What else? And she likes being a slave ls there a lesbian in the house? You had to say something stupid You know I find them disgusting If she were, I wouldn't have her here Come on, let's go Don't wait up, I'm working late... And I don't want to be woken in the morning - I'm changing everything -At your service, Empress. The band will go here I want lights in the park... - We'll hang the lanterns in a row - The very idea of it Using the studio lights... And I need 3 or 4 make up artists Of course, Empress - You like them? - Yes, they're not too bad But I'm better... - How many have you made? - 100 Why did you change everything, and why a make-up artist? Just an idea Anything wrong? Empresses don't have ideas Right, only you do. You should thank me... If not for me, these parties would be a bore Whose idea was it to put cocaine in the sugar? Not yours, but it worked a treat Except for the woman who jumped in the pool to cool down - I've a better surprise this year -Ah? - I've invented a living statue -And what's that? We'll cover Silvia in plaster on one of these pedestals Here, in the shadows, she'll look like a real statue Our guests will love it. Cover her in glue, if they touch her they'll get stuck But is she happy to be naked and covered in plaster? Why not? It'll be fun - Will you introduce us? - You've never met Waldman, this is Silvia Try to keep still - You're still not done. - It's almost finished You might be good, but you're certainly slow The party will be over soon if you don't hurry up 37.7, it's fine You look like a boiled egg. You still want to do it? Do you remember everything? Just wait for my signal. Let's hope it works. Hurry up, Rafaello You need to stand still. Don't move Go away The statue is alive. Good work, Margaret Now watch, they'll pounce just like rabid dogs Margaret, can I take her home? I want to touch that hot marble. See, I told you - She's running away. - Let's get her... See? They all fell for it - She's vanished - She went that way. - How do you feel? - Not well Go on... Get out of here I'll be deducting 10,000 lira from your wages... You thought you'd get away with it... And for free If you want to sleep with my driver... You have to pay, my dear Countess I'm the Madame, and I pay, and you're only the servant Countess but also... ...something of a whore What are you doing? Look. Now you've made the sheets dirty The doctor says the infection has cleared She's faking it Too bad for her, she can stay in prison - The water's off? - Thee days ago - But she still won't apologise - Then take the mirror away as well You see? She's fine Come on, eat You should be grateful she only punished you Take a look You'll get the mirror back when you apologise She's here, Madame I'm listening, what do you want? - I want to apologise - She's seen sense at last Good, you may go now I 'may'... Or I 'must'? Listen, Countess... I don't know what you're doing here, or why you want to stay What's more, I don't care - But be careful - It's no secret, Madame Stop it, I don't want to hear your lies I know you're up to something - Too bad for you - It's the truth, Madame I don't like living outside The noise, the people, it frightens me Living here suits me I obey you... and you heal me - Like an expensive dog - Like an object Very well, then stay... Since the Countess is staying, clean her up, she's absolutely filthy Look at the state of you Let's begin the make-over. Sit down Come here I've decided to out her hair, it's too long What a shame, it's so beautiful This should lower her pride - Shall I? - Go ahead, cut it I told you when you first arrived It doesn't matter if you cut it... Anyway, she likes being treated like an object of desire Isn't that right, Silvia? Turn round, turn round... That's better. She had too much hair before Yes, it was all too much Turn around again They've given you quite a fleecing You've lost weight too, you look like a clothes peg Your clothes don't fit her anymore So, throw them away then And I can have some fun dressing her Good, come along now Let's start with black - This one? - No, I don't like it Light colours are better... Try this one Get undressed now That's not too bad Try this on See how pretty you look Now, let's slash it up the front So everyone will know you aren't the Madame Now we'll put this on your head There... Hold it still Walk forward Turn around She looks like a hen Wait, let's try with the lead No one else has a walking, talking doll like this one - She doesn't say very much -Ah, but she's thinking. But what would she ever have to think about? I don't feel like it. Take it away Hello, little slave... Come on, let's go Get in with me Wash my arms, don't scratch me with your nails Don't get my hair wet Now massage my legs, from top to bottom Be careful, don't tickle me - Mr. Waldman - Show him in Silvia, come here, quickly - It's hot in here - So, it's true... Empress and slave You didn't believe it? Frankly, I didn't think you were capable of something so strange... Yet so smart Slavery, in this socialist century. My compliments... You have my full admiration - Unless... - I know what you're getting at I have doubts... I doubt whether I know your tastes as well as I thought I expect nothing less from such a depraved man... - But you know what I'm like - It's true, I apologise And you? Why do you stay? I don't know I think you know very well... You like being a slave I don't, I just like doing this You'll never get the truth out of her. She's false, and she's a liar. - Then why keep her? - You really need to ask? What are you suggesting? I'm not forcing her to do it Don't get upset Having a slave is nothing to be ashamed of But, does she really do everything you order her to? Silvia, get down On the floor She makes quite a good foot rest What if you order her to undress in front of me? Silvia, you heard. Undress Stop. No striptease Get dressed, and go back to bed I bore you, don't I? - I need you - Deal with it Don't pull your head back before he slaps you You have to be surprised by it Or you just look frightened, Understand? - I look like a sack of potatoes - Let's do it again, just the slap - I'm sorry, Silvia - Encounter by the Lake, take 5 - Silvia, did I hurt you? -A little, but I expected that I just wanted to say sorry Have you acted before? You wanted to try it... Why? What are you doing here? What do you do at Margaret's? I work You know Margaret thinks you're mad. - Do you believe her? - No, of course not That's only because you don't know Don't know? Don't know what? Silvia, what is it? - Sometimes I believe it - That she's mad? That I'm mad What are you doing? Hurry up, Madame is waiting Talk to Alessio about the photos Let's go Poor Countess, wounded and hurt. Feeling better? Let me see... No, it's nothing - But he's an animal. - Margaret - Aren't you dining with us? - No chance I'm going back to my den. You're not getting changed? Thank God today is over Take off my boots Massage them Put some effort into it Now you know why I don't like getting slapped around... It hurts... But for you, it's good... It's good for you, Countess. If you knew how much I'd taken Not only in the movies Look at all this traffic Wake up, Spartaco, overtake that car And will you cheer up? You look like a frightened chicken I'm fine at home. I never want to go out again - Hello? - Sylvia? It's Franco - Hello, Sylvia? - Margaret's not here Don't you like being touched? Please shut up Look... Do you like those two? I'm cold But it's so hot in here I should probably leave, Margaret might come back It's still early. Are you disappointed? Me? Not at all. Why? You thought I enjoyed watching us in the mirror... You were wrong But, if it pleases you, I can say you were the best I've ever had - Happy? - But I don't know If you're happy Do you want a drink? Wait I heard footsteps Someone's there Now what? It's only Vittorina Margaret won't be back for hours - We have time - Time. Time for what? We're locked in Here, get dressed It's hopeless, we're trapped What are you doing? You're still naked She mustn't find us like this Break that mirror and escape That would make it obvious. She can't find out about us We'll think of an excuse Say you weren't feeling well Would it really upset you? Margaret means a lot to me - Do you love her? - I said she means a lot to me Now you'll be kicked out, and I'll be punished You are insane I can punish her how I like Say she had an expression on her face I didn't like Or she stole something of mine... ...even just a comb, I'd throw it out the window... And give her what she deserved And you? You think she has the right to punish you? Well, then - But she believes she does - Exactly - She's also been whipped - Whipped? Really? What happened? Did you whip her? Me? Are you mad? Vittorina takes care of such things Perfect symmetry... The Mistress, the Slave... and the Witch I guess there had to be some flagellation too So, tell me what happened She took me to the bathroom ...and told me to undress And you helped? Your questions are starting to annoy me Do you have any more? Don't you want to get revenge on your Madame? Not at all That's all I need. She knows she deserved it Vittorina, untie her And massage her wrists and ankles I've had enough, let's go No, Margaret, I disagree, you're wrong to punish Silvia Lt means you still treat her like a human being You don't punish an object, you use it Yes, you have a slave, but you still don't know... ...what it means to have another person at your beck and call Who'll do anything you ask And are thereby turned into an object - So what should I do with her? - Silvia, come here Sit down Tell me... What do you feel for her? Hate? Go on, tell him Love? Admiration? She's the Mistress, she feeds me, clothes me... ...she takes care of me - You don't have anyone else? - Nothing else in your life? - Only irritation and boredom And here...? You're happy here? Not always Only when Madame needs me... Or when everyone's out and I'm alone Being at home, with nothing to do or say... At peace Waiting only for my Madame to return and give me orders - She's lying - She's telling the truth It's incredible... Slavery in all its splendour An empress just has to appear and the slaves come running The world is full of submissive desires It isn't just about sex, you know Most people are afraid of freedom, they don't want it Freedom means responsibility, risk... And people don't want risk, they want security This one loves slavery so much, she falls in love with the master You're wrong, she doesn't love anyone but herself She loves what you do to her And you can do whatever you want with her What would you say if she turned you into an erotic object? I don't think that's the Madame's wish She could watch us making love, without participating... Sitting there, like a dog Or we could cover her skin with gold leaf and precious stones And perform a tiny operation on her vocal chords Stop it. You're a monster I'm only joking Silvia is yours and mustn't be touched But we could do so many things together I could. Not you Let me try for a moment, you'll find that you like it And she'll like it, too. You'll see Don't you want more? To start with, get on your knees - What's that? - To stop her talking It used to be called the "Sphere of Angosh" We can do anything we like to her with this, she won't make a sound Stick out your tongue Enough Waldman, you're starting to disappoint me - Your bed is ready, Madame - I know, but I'm not tired Well? You're still here? I know how to get into bed. Now get out. Shut the doors, and go to sleep We're alone now, Madame - So? - Nothing, Madame You, bring me a magazine Not that one, it's old. Idiot. - Don't make that face at me - What face? - You smiled when you looked at me - No, Madame, I smiled afterwards - But why did you smile? - I don't know You don't know? You just can't be bothered What should I say? Get me a glass of water. Go on - You did that on purpose. - No, Madame So insolent. You deserve... Do you want to whip me, Madame? Yes, I want to whip you Silvia... You're crying, Silvia Come on, it didn't hurt that much Silvia, stop it I promise I won't do it again. Do you feel better now? You know I was only joking Now you're laughing. Come here. Stay still... Still, still, still...l I won't stop. I'll do it till you die. Till you die. Till you die. What horrible hands. You could use some nail polish I'll get it, it has to be done You know what? I'll paint each nail a different colour Have you ever thought about having children? No, never To be honest, I never thought about it either My career came first, but what about you? You're healthy, and all that What did you want to be when you were a child? I don't know. Nothing, I think I never made my mind up. Not even then Anything was fine for me, so long as it made lots of money I was born to be a Madame, to command But what about you? You'll have to do something I'm fine here, I never want to leave Of course you'll stay, you know I appreciate all the things I own You'll stay And you...? Aren't you tired? Stay, if you want Get out.... Go back to your room. It seems a rather boring thing to me Yet, look at Indian temples The endless use of the same image, like the symbol of life So, do you consider vice an escape? Vice, or some other obsession To escape from the routine? Yes. Though vice too, can become too much, don't you think? True, vice too can become routine And so, we grow old Goethe said men believe they mature when they grow old In fact, they either harden, or rot What does the Madame want to do? - Is she ready? - One moment Hurry up, she's calling Dina, what is going on? Tell me I told you so often to leave At least I've an excuse, I have to work because I'm poor But you? Right, let's go Come on Put this on, the Madame orders it Here she is As I told you, tonight I'm auctioning a slave to the highest bidder Who is she? - Is it a game? - No, it's not a game She's a rival king's daughter, and my prisoner A slave. Not a person, an object... The buyer can do what they like to her But who is she? ls she a film star? No, she's a real slave, and I really am selling her Vittorina, bring her on Now, show her to these gentlemen Beautiful, no? - A luxurious object - Quite right... Look at that perfect body, gentlemen... Thanks Vittorina, you can go Look at these hands, gentlemen, they're oozing class You know it would be great if this was real... To buy a woman like that... A slave like that She must be a prostitute But why? I like to think it's real Just think, this used to be normal What fools we've become I think the idea of selling someone is quite exciting Come here, you're an expert Look at those legs Look at the shape of the wrist Look at the ankles A superb specimen What's the price? - I'll buy her - No, hold on a moment... You must bid, it's an auction We start on a million, and go up in increments of 500 Who's going to start? It's an exceptional offer. Gentlemen, the auction is open. It's a magnificent specimen Come on, gentlemen, come on... - Who's going to buy her? - One and a half - Two - Two and a half - She's worth so much more - I assure you she's good value To feed her, make her pretty... Take care of her, educate her... It's been an expensive job 3 million. 3 million from the gentleman. Very good. - Three and a half. - Don't be mean She's very docile... House trained... And she can be moulded according to her master or Madame's tastes - Come on, we're at 3.5 - Can I bid as well? - I'm not selling her to you - Three and a half Four. Four and half. Five and a half. Any more bids? She's yours, sir... The highest bidder You were wrong, she's not what you expected I'm sad you're leaving. I wanted to tell you... You can always come to me if you need anything - Goodbye, Madame -You can go, Dina Rem ember, it isn't a real contract... You can always go back home and live a normal life... You're not well, and you know it I'm not strong like you, Madame If I fell in love, it's because with you I don't feel as alone as I used to And that's why I sold you To help your recovery All I ever wanted was to look at you... ...and feel protected Perhaps because I don't deserve it, or I've loved so few Something is still waiting for me Peace... Or a certain balance Look, I don't know if this is the reason... But I do know that what happens next will depend on you It frightens me to think about it You always expect something from others And this is wrong... You must learn to live with people I'm telling you, it's not as hard as you think You have to do something... You have to decide You can't spend your life looking in mirrors Good luck, Silvia... I really mean it
