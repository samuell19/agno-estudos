You know that tree belongs in a compost heap, not at the front in the store. Quiet, she will hear you. Someone's been drinkin' a little too much eggnog again? A, there is no such thing as too much eggnog and B, Geraldine will make a perfect Christmas tree one year. Geraldine? Geraldine. She just uh, needs a little time and a little TLC. You know my mom loved every tree that came through here. - And every human. - And I am not about to let her legacy go now that I am running things. We got decorations up the day after Thanksgiving, just like she did. Hot cocoa and cookies for the shoppers, just like she did. And now, I'm gonna give Geraldine here a shot because that is exactly what she would do. She'd be proud of you, Ang. I hope so. I know so. All the work you've put into this place since last Christmas. She made Christmas so special for everyone, I just really wanna honor her this year. Well, if I didn't work here, I'd think she was still running this place. It's just like she left it. Right down to our aprons. I told you Blair, the aprons stay. - They're itchy... - Ugh. Besides, you know I'd rock a jewel tone. I know... Ooh, any good mail? The best mail. The official schedule for the Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights. Festival of Lights. Really need a catchier name for that. Yeah. Well, don't leave me hanging. We've got hot chocolates from around the world. I'm here for it. - Madlib Christmas carols. - Already laughing. Make your own gingerbread house. Aww, Dad's favorite. And the tree decorating contest for the lighting of town square. And Mom's favorite. We loved the tree lighting. Well, speaking of trees, it looks like we have a shopper. Ooh, I'm on it. Keep an eye on her, will ya? I don't think she's goin' anywhere. Oh, I was talking to Geraldine. Hello there, can I help you find something? Yes please, I need a tree. Oh, well you came to the right place. What kind of tree are you looking for? Well, I've never bought a tree before. Well, I can definitely help you find the perfect tree. I'm thinking a tree that has a lot of space underneath 'cause I can tell Santa's gonna bring you a lot of gifts. Well, it shouldn't be too big 'cause it has to fit on the top of the car. Ooh, boy, this could take a while. Do you need a cookie while you shop? So, who're you shopping with? Does someone else need a cookie? They definitely do. Or maybe some hot chocolate. - David. - Hey, Angie. You know her? Uh, Angie and I used to be friends. Used to be? Ouch. Uh, what are you doing here? I haven't seen you since graduation. Uh, we're home for Christmas. I'm working remotely for a couple of weeks, staying at my sister's and we needed a tree so, I knew where we had to come. Happiest trees in town. How can a tree be happy? Well, let me show you. Come on. Abigail, Eleanor, Miranda. Ladies, I'd like you to meet David and uh, I'm sorry, I didn't get your name. Gabby. That's a beautiful name. I'm named after my mom. So am I, I'm Angie. So you named your trees? Well, that's what makes them happy. You gotta treat them like they're family. We planted Abigail here, when I graduated high school. Eleanor was to celebrate our new greenhouse and uh, old Miranda over there, well, we plated her after I got my first broken heart. My mom always said there was no better way to celebrate or be sad, than planting a tree. How is your mom? Uh, she actually passed away last Christmas. Angie, I'm so sorry. Your mom was a wonderful lady. Definitely planted a lot of trees. Gabby here lost her mom two years ago. I'm so sorry to hear that. Well, if your mom was anything like mine, I know she's definitely smiling down on you right now. I think Abigail here is telling me she wants to go home with you, what do you say? Yeah? Let's go grab some rope, okay? This place is exactly how I remembered it. Oh, I try to keep things the same. Yeah, exactly the same. - How long are you in town? - Just for Christmas. We're heading back to Florida in January. Oh well, that's a... Uh, warmer. Tell Lily we said hi. I will. It was nice to meet you, Gabby. Thank you for the tree. Of course, take good care of Abigail, okay? I will. - What? - What do you mean, what? David Mitchell came to see you. David Mitchell came to buy a tree. From you. I haven't seen him in like ten years. You heard him, he's just here for Christmas. They're leaving in January. So, probably won't even see them before they go. But you wouldn't mind if you did. Okay, don't you have inventory? It's time I do inventory. There we go... Aunt Lily, we got a tree. I see that. Did you pick out a good one? Mm-hmm, this is Abigail. Abigail? Daddy's friend Angie helped us pick her out. Angie? You drove all the way out to Waldron's Nursery? They have the happiest trees. Exactly, you wouldn't want us to get an unhappy one, would ya? - Can we bring Abigail inside? - Sure, yeah. I think the tree can stay outside. We have to take it with us tomorrow. Come on. I'm home. Hey. Ooh, what is this? This is Stone Ginge. Wow dad, this might even beat your Ginge-mahal from last year. Better pace yourself, you're gonna run outta landmarks. Well, if I do, I'll just start sculpting presidents. Ginge Washington, Thomas Gingerson. Maybe we'll find you some more landmarks. Ha, ha. How was the nursery today? You will never guess who stopped by. - Hmm? - David Mitchell. David Mitchell? He's home for Christmas. And I got to meet his daughter, she is such a sweetheart. Hmm, that's nice. Dad, why is Aunt Joan's ceramic tree over here, in the corner? I thought it looked nice there. You know that we always put it in the window. Mom likes the... The way it lights up the window. I know, Angie. I miss her too. But your mom would want us to make the most of Christmas, it was her favorite. I know. I just don't wanna change too many of our traditions this year. Not when everything else feels different. Speaking of traditions... Ah, the Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights. - They need a new name for that. - Yeah. Are you entering the gingerbread contest again? Oh yeah, of course. The Stone Ginge here is just practice. You know, it's... It's hard to think about the Christmas tree lighting, without your mom. You know, she always wanted to enter the contest. - Really? - Yeah. She said if she could find the time, she'd make sure that a Waldron's Nursery tree took the top spot. She was always so busy. But she took it personally when a tree she raised from a seedling didn't win. She loved those trees. Happiest trees in town. Happiest husband. Come on, I'll warm you up some dinner. Hmm... I entered. You did. And very dramatically. No, not that. The Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights, Christmas tree decorating contest. What? Doesn't that start tomorrow? Yes, which is why I need you to help me come up with a theme right away. What do we think about a Christmas love tree? - I don't get it. - Yeah, me either. Okay, if we're gonna win this, we need to come up with something really good. Wait, when did this become a we thing? When I registered us this morning. Angela Catherine Waldron. Look, it says teams of two, who else am I gonna pair up with? Literally, anyone. Angie, you know I have zero flair for decorating. Less than zero. Negative zero. Okay well, negative zero's not a thing. And neither is my decorating ability. Come on, I'll put on all the lights, all you have to do is just plug it in. It'll be a piece of Christmas cake. Come on, Blair. You know how I told you I wanted to find a way to honor my mom this Christmas? This is it. My dad told me my mom always wanted to enter this contest. So, if we win and they light up one of her trees in Town Square, that'll be the perfect way to remember her. You're not gonna make me miss out on that are you? You know, this is still a competition. You're not guaranteed to win. Well, not technically, but who else loves Christmas like I do? - Literally, no one. - No one. - Ever. - Ever. I just have to plug the lights in? That's the spirit. Okay, we need to come up with something... unique, but familiar. You know, cute, but classy. Fresh, timeless. A very uh, very something Christmas. Yeah, you know, I think, I think you got it. Okay, okay, um... The Tree Wise Men. Gold, frankincense and fir? You are leaning pretty heavy on the Magi there, Blair. I've got it. Flight of the Bumble Tree. Okay, we're trying to win this. We can't go in there with Flight of the Bumble Tree. Everyone likes bumblebees, right? Totally. High hive... What, you don't like my pun? Well, that stings. - Are you done? - Almost. I'm working on something with a honeycomb over, but it's not quite there yet. Then, let's hope it never arrives. Uh, we have a few minutes before the decorating starts, I'm gonna go check out the competition. Okay, just bee-have yourself. - Ugh... - Okay. Angie? David. I didn't expect to see you here. Well, I, I didn't either. Blair and I signed up last minute. - Oh. - How's Abigail? Um, she cried a little on the first night. But she's getting used to us. So you came to watch the contest? Oh, uh, sort of. 'Cause that's Blair and me's setup over there. I'm just scopin' out the competition in the meantime. What do you think? Well, I mean, the balsam fir was clearly under-watered in its juvenile years. Oh, clearly. And the scotch pine and Norway spruce are patchy. That Arizona cypress is a ringer from out of town, and the three Douglas firs, mm, they're just gonna have to split the Douglas fir vote, so... - Rookie mistake. - Mm-hmm. To be honest, the only tree I'm worried about is this one. It's got strong, healthy branches. Piney fragrance. Pliable needles, I mean, you can tell this tree was clearly loved. Almost seems familiar. It should, you sold it to us. - Abigail? - Yeah. Oh, wait, you didn't say anything. You didn't really give me the chance. So you joined the contest? Uh, yeah. But not by myself. Daddy. Gabby, you remember my friend, Angie. - Hi. - Hi. We're not really decorators. But Gabby here heard about the competition and begged me to enter, so we picked out a tree and here we are. Well, with Abigail on your side, I might have to step up my game a little. Oh yeah. Really played yourself on that one there, didn't ya? Thank you all for joining the 21st annual Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights Christmas Tree Decorating Contest quarterfinals. Decorating will begin in just a minute, but first, a reminder of the rules. There are three rounds of competition. First round, freestyle. Decorate your tree with the theme of your choice. Five trees will move on to the semi-finals, where the contestants will be given a surprise theme 48 hours before the competition. And finally, three trees will advance to the final round, held in our historic townhall with the same theme every year. The meaning of Christmas. And of course, the winner's tree will be lit on Christmas Eve in Town Square. So, test those lights, untangle that garland and get ready to get festive. Well, good luck. You too. All right contestants, it's time. On your marks. Get set. Decorate. Time. So, we just need to beat out eight other trees, plus David. Easier said than done. Come on, I already hear our tree's getting some good buzz... You are incorrigible. - Look, Daddy. - Look at that. Wow, it's bee-ginning to look a lot like Christmas. Oh, so he can do it? Uh, we're calling it the Flight of the Bumble Tree. - It's so pretty. - Aw, thanks Gabby. And you did a very beautiful job dressing Abigail, she looks like she's ready for the parade. Come on Gabs, we better get back. Angie. I hope we win, but I hope you do too. Could she be any more adorable? Not without a warning label. Oh, incoming. Hello, Angie, Blair. Tell me about your tree. Oh, well, it was inspired by "Flight of the Bumble Bee". Bee-themed colors and a thousand tiny musical notes, just like the song. Very clever. I hope we didn't bumble it. Well, I just love the honeycombs, what a sweet touch. Thank you, ladies. David Mitchell. It's been a while. Too long. You haven't changed a bit. Ha, don't try to butter up the judge, dear. Tell me about your tree. Well, her name is Abigail and we got her from our friend Angie. It's our Red, White and Blue Spruce. My dad and I decorated it. Fourth of July is her favorite holiday. After Christmas, of course. Of course. We wanted it to look like an exploding firework. Well, I'm surprised I don't hear a boom. Very nice tree and very nicely done, Gabby. Thank you. Well folks, I have to say, the competition has never been stronger. Let's give it up for our contestants. Without further ado, our fourth runner-up and first qualifier, a Candy Cane Christmas. Our third runner-up, Christmas with the Nutcracker. Our second runner-up, the Twelve Days of Christmas Tree. Our first runner-up, Flight of the Bumble Tree. And the winners of the Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights Christmas Tree Decorating Contest quarterfinals is... I think it's just getting longer. The Red, White and Blue Spruce. Congratulations and thank you to everyone who participated. Semi-finalists, we'll see you next week. - I'll be back. - Okay. Congratulations, I guess I'll see you back here in a few days. I guess so. Nicely done. What a wonderful start to the competition this year. I can't wait to see what you two come up with next week. I can't wait to hear the theme. You know the rules. Forty-eight hours before the competition begins. No one gets a special advantage. But something tells me you don't need one. What are you smiling at? I'm not smiling. Just help me take the tree down. I'm sure Dad's waiting for us at the nursery. Yeah. Better not bee late. Okay. We won. We won. Wow. Congratulations. Maybe you guys want to tackle my house next? - Oh, I don't know about that. - Why not? Well, it's a lot of work putting everything up, bringing it back down. Besides, we're not here that long. Hey, why don't you go see if we have enough wood for the fire tomorrow night? I told you those decorations are in my basement if you want them. Come on, Lil, when'd you take your Christmas lights down last year? Um, just in time for Easter. You know how much I work. I do know, that's why I don't wanna leave you with a mess to clean up. Hmm. Hey, has Gabby said anything to you about what she wants for Christmas? She keeps saying she can't decide. What kind of a kid doesn't have a Christmas list a mile long? Yours. Angie, is everything okay in here? Don't come in here. I'm wrapping your gift. Okay. I'm trying to wrap your gift. - Oh... - Hmm. Oh. The new slippers I asked for. How do you do that? I was trying to disguise it. As what? Oh, it was uh, it was evolving. Hmm... Angie, your mother was the best gift wrapper I ever met. Remember the year I needed a new briefcase? And she wrapped it to look like a bike? She had a gift for making ordinary things beautiful. Ya know, I learned early on I was never gonna be able to keep up with her on that front. But I also learned I didn't have to. I found my own way of doing things for your mother. My own way of showing her how much I loved her. They didn't always look the way hers did. But as your mom said, it's what's inside that counts. Don't worry. I'll act surprised. Okay, last one. Cool. You're quiet tonight. I'm just thinking. About what? Mom. Yeah, I think about her a lot, too. Like what? Her smile, her laugh, how you look just like her. How she loved warm weather and sunflowers. She did? She did. She used to grow them in the garden in our backyard. Dad. Yeah, sweetie? I know what I want for Christmas. Enjoy your tree. Don't forget to water her every day. - Hi. - Hi. Saying goodbye to another one? Ah, Francine. Planted her when I got a B+ on my math test. See, there really is no bad reason to plant a tree. Oh, what brings you by? Abigail givin' you trouble? Because I could talk to her. I was actually hoping you could help me with something else. I wanted some flowers. Oh well, Blair's in the nursery today. No, I'm not. Blair, what are you doing? Taking my turn out front. Angie can help you with the flowers. Blair. Welcome to Waldron's. Can I help you find something? - Wha... - Nice to see you again. Uh, I guess I will show you to the greenhouse. We have some gorgeous poinsettias. Just got roses in. Actually, I have sort of an unusual request. Oh? Sunflowers, for Christmas morning. Ooh, that might be kinda tricky. They're not really in season and we only have a few days before Christmas. I know. I guess I thought if anyone could pull it off. Well, I will try, but I might have more luck if you expand your flower options. I wish I could. They're for Gabby. See, her mother loved sunflowers. She just told me the only thing she really wants for Christmas is a bouquet of them to honor her mom. Okay, that's uh... A little bit of pressure. Yeah. I ordered some plastic flowers, but... But there is nothing quite like the real thing. Well, I will definitely try. Thanks, Angie. Ooh, don't thank me yet. I mean, to get sunflowers here before Christmas morning? I know, but hey, it's the season of miracles and hope. So, I'm hoping for a miracle. It's from Betty. Oh, the theme for round two. Angels and evergreen. Hmm, game on. See you there. I thought he wanted flowers. Oh, he does. Sunflowers. This time of year? Yeah, I told him we'd try. Did you get Betty's text? Angels and evergreen. Do you have any ideas? Mm-mm, do you? No, I think I peaked with the bumble tree. Okay. Well, first things first. Who are you calling? Everyone I can think of. Hey, this is Angie from Waldron's Nursery in Greenpine Grove. I'm trying to track down some sunflowers. Yeah, sunflowers... How adorable are these guys? I might be biased, but I think very. I thought I'd send some with you to the contest. Aw, thanks, Dad. So, are you ready? No. No, we have our theme, which is angels and evergreen. But I have no idea what to do with it yet. I'm sure you'll figure something out, sweetie. You always do. I'm done. Ohp, don't want him to get lonely. Do we have enough decorations? I don't know, did our tree triple in size overnight? I just want to be prepared. We're prepared to decorate a redwood. - And we have the photos? - Right here. We're all set. You can relax. Okay. Where are David and Gabby? Um, I don't know. Maybe they're running late. Hello. - David. - Angie? Where are you? The contest is about to start. Oh, uh yeah. We should be there right after it ends. What? - We got a flat. - Where are you? Uh, Lily's house. Why? Uh, stay there. David and Gabby got a flat, so I'm gonna go get them. Uh, you can't leave now. It's starting. Just put the lights on and I'll be back, okay? Angie, if we don't make it through this round it's over. You can get started. I will be right back to help. Okay? But, uh. Contestants ready. Oh, my Lord. Okay. That's a lot of lights. I didn't know there'd be this many lights, okay... I'm sorry, sweetie. Maybe when Lily gets home, she can take us in time to see... Angie? What are you doing here? What does it look like? I'm saving the day. - But the competition. - Has already started. So, let's all stop talking. We'll start loading boxes and we'll be there before we know it, okay? Here you go, sweetie. All right. I've got these. I'll get the door, come on. Thank you, Angie. You're welcome. Let's get these trees decorated. Good luck. I'm back. Welcome back. So just a question that's been on my mind. What were you thinking? I couldn't just leave them. I thought you wanted to win for your mom. I do. I just... I don't want them to lose. Hand me those white lights, Gabs. I'm glad Angie's our friend, Dad. Me, too, Gabs. Me, too. Thank you. Time. Our angels look really pretty. Oh, what beautiful angels. Look at all these angels and evergreen. Tell me about your tree. We have 100 angels in our tree. My dad and my Aunt Lily helped me make them. Oh, and we have one on top, but we didn't make that one. Well, I'm very impressed. I noticed you had a little bit of a late start today. Yeah, we had some car trouble. My dad got a flat tire, but our friend Angie picked us up, so we could still decorate our tree. Well, Angie sounds like a very good friend. I better go see what her tree looks like up close. Angie, Blair, tell me about your tree. Well, our angels are the people of our town. Oh. Yeah, we have Mr. Byrd, who's run the library for over 50 years. And Dr. Wolf, who gives free piano lessons to anyone who can't afford them. And my mom who made sure anyone who came into the nursery left with a smile on their face, so our angels are the people of Greenpine Grove. That's lovely, Angie. I, uh, understand you had a little delay as well. And you lost your angel on top. Oh, it's nothing. Just helping a friend. Well, it's a big risk to take for a friend. Well, some friends are worth it. I would like to thank all of our semi-finalists for their beautiful decorating. What a wonderful way to show our community's Christmas spirit. Our first qualifier, in third place, Angie Waldron and Blair Baulin. In second place, our second qualifiers, David and Gabby Mitchell. And in first place, our final qualifiers, Tanya Motley and Collin Fleming. We'll see you at the finals. And don't forget our gala to celebrate our finalists this weekend right here at the Pavilion. - Want to go say hi? - Yeah. For a second. Congratulations. I feel like we cost you the ribbon. You didn't knock our angel off. No, but if it wasn't for us, then you'd had time to fix it, so I definitely owe you one. You definitely do. Do you want to come for dinner? I'm sure Angie already has plans for dinner, Gabs. No, she doesn't. How is five o'clock? I will bring dessert. See you then. Oh. Hmm. Oh. What are you doing in there? Trying to find something to wear. Well, don't you think this is just a little over the top for a date? It's not a date. It's just dinner. I can't find my red sweater. That cashmere cableknit? Just a guess. You let me borrow that, remember? I had that interview. That was last Christmas. And you're just now missing it. Right, my fault. I'll bring it back. Okay, that doesn't help me tonight. What am I supposed to wear? What about what you have on? I can't wear what I have on. I wore this to tree decorating. And? And, uh, I need something else. For a date. It's dinner. Well, you're putting a lot of thought into this outfit for just dinner. Okay, well, you don't get to have an opinion after you stole... Uh, nah, uh, borrowed. My favorite sweater. What do we think? Too fancy? No. It's perfect. For a date. It's not a date. Okay, if you say so. Just seems like you're cleaning my house a lot. As for example. I just wanna make sure everything's tidy. It's called being hospitable. Oh, so now your big sister is dirty and inhospitable? No, just... Okay, David put down the dustpan, okay? Come on over here. Take a deep breath. The house is clean. Dinner's in the oven. Why don't you just relax? Oh, perfect. Help me get under the couch. Well, look at you. Where you off to? Just uh, dinner. With David Mitchell. A date. No, no, no, no. Here, take the Ginger Gate Bridge with you for dessert. Aw, it's almost too pretty to eat. - Oh, okay. - Ah, ah. I said almost. Blair, do you want to stay and help me get started on the uh, Leaning Tower of Ginger? Can I eat all the leftover gingerbread? You drive a hard bargain. I know what I'm worth. I should head out. Okay, bye sweetheart. Drive safe. Bye. Enjoy your date. It's not a date. Want marshmallows or gummy bears? Oh, definitely marshmallows. Oh, yeah. Lily. Angie, come in. Hi. I hope everyone likes gingerbread. Who doesn't like gingerbread? Wow, can we eat it? After dinner. Can I take your coat? Sure. I don't think it'll fit you. Thank you. I got you. So how have you been, Lily? Busy, I'm covering some extra shifts at the hospital, so some of the other nurses can travel for the holidays. Aunt Lily works in the nursery. So do I. My babies need to be changed less often, but... I'm so glad you two reconnected. My house has never been cleaner. Lily, shouldn't you be getting to work? I've got a few minutes. Well, dinner should be ready in a bit. - Can I help you with anything? - No, no, I think I got it. - Come on, I'll give you a tour. - Okay. Be sure to look under the couch. And this is my room. This is Aunt Lily's goldfish, Bruno. She's letting me take care of him while we stay here. Oh, nice to meet you, Bruno. How do you do? Oh, is this your mom? She's really beautiful. You know, it was just about a year ago when I lost my mom. Does it make you sad? Every day. I miss her so much. I miss my mom, too. But you know, if my mom were here, I know she wouldn't want me to be too sad. So I try to find reasons to be happy. Like finding good homes for my Christmas trees like Abigail. Hot cocoa by the fireplace with my dad. Making new friends like you. I'm so sorry you lost your mom, Gabby. But it really does help to have a friend who knows what it feels like. So thank you for being that friend for me. Dinner's ready. Okay. Ready? Uh, that was delicious. Thanks, Gabby and I like cooking together. Don't we, Gabs? I like helping my dad in the kitchen, too. You know he spends the entire Christmas season making his gingerbread masterpieces? Last year he built the Statue of Gingerty about this high. - Really? - Mm-hmm. There's nothing quite like hot cocoa and gingerbread on a snowy night. Brr. What? You used to like the snow. I guess I've been in Florida a little too long. Got used to the sunshine. Well, Florida sounds beautiful, but there's nothing quite like a white Christmas. Sledding and ice skating, snowmen. I never built a snowman. Really? How old are you? Ten. Okay, you're telling me you have gone 10 years of your life without building a snowman? Well, I say gear up because we're doin' it. You heard her, Gabs. Gear up. Whoo, okay. We just need a corn cob pipe, coal and magic hat. We don't have any of those things. What kind of household are you runnin' here? Okay, that's fine. We will use my mom's secret snowman recipe. Snowman recipe? Mm-hmm. We will need raisins for the eyes, a candy cane for the mouth, and a carrot for the nose. I'll be right back. I haven't seen her this excited in a long time. Well, snowmen have that effect on people. You're pretty good with kids, huh? Well, I don't know if I'm good with them, but I really like them. There's just something so genuine about kids. Remind me to not take things so seriously. You're building a snowman on a weeknight. How serious can you be taking things? Okay, some things need to be taken seriously like snowmen and Christmas trees. Sunflowers. Ah. Sorry, I had to ask. I have called everyone I can think of. I know. - Okay. - You're back. We didn't have any raisins or candy canes. And we ate all the carrots. So I have some olives, pickles and ketchup. All right. That's perfect. That is the perfect first-time snowman building recipe. Let's do this. - Come on, Gabs. - Here's the pickle. Eyes. He looks funny. All right. Okay. A scarf. Yeah. Whew. Gabby, you are a natural at building snowmen. Daddy, can we take a picture? Of course. Okay, guys. Oh. Everybody say pickle. Pickle. Come here, Gabs. Hey, why don't you go brush your teeth? Dad. Gabby. Okay. She is such a sweetheart. Yeah, she's a good kid. The last couple of years have been tough on her. Losing her mom. So I decided to come back home for a while. I thought it'd be nice for her to be around family. It's a lot for a little kid to handle. It's a lot for anyone to handle. Yeah, losing Gabrielle... Felt like losing a part of myself. I keep telling Gabby we're gonna be all right, but... But? What if I'm doing it wrong? What if I don't know how to do this without Gabrielle? From where I sit, Gabby's a pretty amazing kid. And you're a pretty amazing dad. I've been so worried about her since her mom passed, but it was good to see her laughing tonight. Just being a kid. I brushed my teeth. Let me see. Oh, I'm blinded. What are you? A professional tooth brusher? Say good night, sweetheart. Good night, Angie. Good night. - I'll come tuck you in. - Okay. Angie, will you be back? Oh, I... Well, will you? Soon. Good night. Gabby, have you asked Santa for anything for Christmas? No, I just want sunflowers. Well, maybe you should think of something else you'd like just in case. But I don't want anything else. Gabs. When can Angie come over again? I don't know, sweetie. We'll have to ask her. She's got her store and her own dad to take care of. He can come, too. You really like bein' around her, huh? Yeah, but... What? I like being around you when you're around her, too. Good night, Daddy. Good night, Gabs. I love you. Hey, you don't have to do that. I don't mind. Here, let me. Really, I... got it. Uh, so where are all your Christmas decorations? I just noticed. Well, the truth is Gabrielle was always the decorator in our house. Christmas, Easter, Halloween, President's Day. She just loved to celebrate. No matter the occasion. Since she's been gone, I-I don't know. I guess I just haven't felt much like celebrating. Hmm, what does Gabby think? I think Gabby's a little too young to remember decorating. Besides, we're leaving in a couple of weeks, so... Right. Back to Florida. Look, it's just... Hmm. I know your life with Gabby is different than it used to be, but I still think it's worth celebrating. Lily must have inherited our parent's Christmas decorations when they moved. This stuff is great. Well, most of it. Oh. Whoa, whoa, whoa. What are you doing? I'm setting up Christmas Village. Okay, the ice rink goes in the center. I guess I didn't realize Christmas Village had such strict zoning laws. I'm just trying to do Christmas the way my mom did. I don't want to forget. Angie, I knew your mom. There's no way anyone could forget her. Well, just make sure people don't have to walk too far to the rink, okay? Wouldn't dream of it. Aw, what is this? Uh, that's nothing. You made this. It's adorable. We can put it back. David and his best friend, Angie. Wow. You keep it. I don't want you to forget me either. Hey, did you save me some gingerbread? Oh, sorry. Oh, you're home. Did you get off work early? Uh, no. Oh, wow. I didn't realize it was so late. I should get home. Uh, can you just put the school next to rink ya know, for the kids? Where else would it go? Thank you. Good night. Good night, Lily. Good night. No, no, no. I appreciate it, Chuck. Yep, I'll see you soon. Thanks. What was that about? Work. That bad? Actually, it was a promotion. David, that's great. It's about time. Except they need me back in the office the day after Christmas. Oh, I was just getting used to having you and Gabby here. But it will be nice to have somewhere warm to visit when everyone gets back from Christmas vacation. Nothing like winter in Florida. Daddy, did you get the lights? Got 'em. Let's go. You built a snowman with them? That's adorable. It's not that adorable. Really? Did the snowman have a name? Toasty. Toasty? Gabby's a creative little girl, so. Right. Gabby's creative and David is... Going back to Florida in a few weeks. His sister lives here. He has a daughter. Whom you adore and who loves you. And I have Dad to think about. And I am just starting to get my feet set at the store. And I just... Angie, it's David. Yeah, I know it's David and he's cute, but I just don't- No, Angie. It's David. Ah, it's David. We were just talkin' about Toasty. Toasty the snowman? Yep, mm-hmm. How is he? Did he sleep okay? He looked well rested. You should stop over later and check on him, Ang. Okay. Ah, how did Gabby like the decorations? You were right. She lit up right when she saw them. We spent the entire morning putting up lights outside. Well, she is a natural. You know not like someone who would put the ice-skating rink in the wrong place. So, what brings you by? I was wondering if you two were coming to the Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights Christmas Tree Decorating Contest Finalist Gala tonight? You rehearsed that, didn't you? The whole way here. Yeah, I think we are going. Right, Blair? Oh, definitely. It's gonna be a little late for Gabby, so Lily said she'd watch her, but maybe we could all go together? No. I just remembered. I have plans. What? What plans? Definite plans. Big ones. Definite, big plans. That's too bad. Isn't it? So, I guess you two are gonna have to go without me. So, you'll pick her up, right? I think I remember the way. See you tonight. Okay. You do not have plans. But you do. Come on in. Can I get you anything? Apple cider, eggnog, a Colosseum made of gingerbread. No thank you, but my daughter and I did enjoy your Ginger Gate Bridge. Yeah, Angie mentioned that you have a daughter of your own now. Yeah. Gabby, she's 10. She has your eyes. And the rest of her mother's features fortunately. Angie told me you lost your wife. I'm so sorry. Yeah, I'm sorry to hear about Mrs. Waldron. She always made this place feel like a second home to me. She had a knack for that. Could meet a stranger and within five minutes, they're laughing like they've been friends forever. Angie takes after her in that way. I do see a little bit of Angela in Angie every time I look at her. I'm sure it's the same with you and Gabby. So how long you in town for? I was supposed to be leaving in a couple of weeks, but I uh... Wow, you look beautiful. You don't look so bad yourself. All right. We should get going. Thanks. I will be home at 11:00. Then I will see you at 11:00. You don't have to wait up for me, Dad. Oh, come on. It'll be like old times. Speaking of which- - Dad, I am 30 years old. Fine. Okay, you kids don't stay out too late on a school night, or I will- Come looking for you in my bathrobe. - Bye, Dad. - Bye, sweetie. Your dad's just like I remember. - Wow. - It's beautiful. There they are. Angie, David, don't you both look wonderful? So dashing, so lovely. Everyone's talking about you two. - Oh. - We're just here for a dance. As the trees to beat. - Oh, well, that's... - Flattering. Yeah, we both really- - Love trees. Oh. Well, I will see you two on the dance floor. - So. - So. Isn't this? Our senior prom song. Let's see if I remember how to do this. I know I don't. Senior prom feels like a lifetime ago. But also, like just yesterday. One of my best memories from high school, though it started as one of the worst. What are the chances we'd both get dumped right before prom? You worked out okay. Better than okay. I just wish we'd stayed in touch. I left to college, got married, had Gabby. You know how it is. Life happens. I know. I'm just glad that you're back. So am I. I did not do that. Yes, you did. You totally did that. Ah, it's funny being back here. All these old memories coming back, seeing old friends. I'm happy to be reconnecting with everybody. I am sure everybody is happy to be reconnecting with you. There you are. I thought I heard voices. Did you have a nice time? - Yeah. - It was perfect. Hey, would you like some hot chocolate? Dad. Oh, oh, uh... I left something on the stove. Thank you for tonight. Good night, Angie. Good night, David. Okay, thank you for checking. Merry Christmas. Still no luck? Why can't her favorite flower be a poinsettia? Or a rhododendron? I can source rhododendrons. I can't even spell it. You sure are spending a lot of time on finding sunflowers. It's all she wants for Christmas, Blair. Oh, I know. I'm just sayin' maybe it's less about Gabby and more about a certain someone else. Look, I... have to take this call. Hmm. This is Angie. You do? That's great. No, no, no, no, no. I need them before Christmas. Uh, okay. Thank you for letting me know. Bad luck? That was Morgan's Nursery in North Dakota. Apparently, they have sunflowers, but they're not making any deliveries until after Christmas. I'm sorry, Ang. Me, too. I guess I should break the news to David. Oh, look who it is. What do you think? Here or by the fireplace? That thing? Maybe in the fireplace. Where's your Christmas spirit? I think it got lost in the thicket of garland you hung over my bathroom sink. Hey, you're the one who suggested we decorate. And you're the one who reminded me we'd have to pack it all away again. I can take care of it. Might be a little tough to do from Florida, Dave. Right, the promotion. Have you told Gabby yet? Uh, no. There's someone else I want to tell first. - David. - Hi. I know why you're here. You do? And I am so sorry. Blair and I have called everywhere and there's no way we can get sunflowers in time for Christmas. Oh. I knew it was a long shot. Um, but thank you for trying. Angie... Actually, I do have something for Gabby. What's that? This is Geraldine. She's had a really rough start and she needs someone who can look past what she is and see what she can still become. I think Gabby's that person. And I know it's no sunflowers and it's not the hot toy of the season, but- - It's perfect. Thank you. Ah, was there something else? Actually, yes. Gabby's been begging me to build another snowman. But we both know we can't do it without you. Blair's off today, but I can come tomorrow. Gabby would love to see you. Well, I would love to see Gabby. One o'clock? One o'clock. Daddy, can Angie stay for dinner tonight? Well, I don't know, sweetie. We'll have to ask her. I hope she can. She makes me laugh. Me, too. Hey, guys. She returns. - Hi, Aunt Lily. - Hi, Sunshine. How many overnights is that in a row for you? I'm not sure, is there a number higher than infinity? You must be beat. Can I get you some breakfast? Yes, please. I'm starving. You're comin' to the finals tomorrow, right? Wouldn't miss it. Hey, why don't you go get dressed, sweetie? Okay. So I was meaning to talk to you about something. Mm-hmm? I'm not gonna take that promotion in Florida. I was thinkin' about stayin' in town for a while. Maybe even... There you go. Yep. Sorry, guys. I gotta take this. I'll be right back. Hi, Chuck. Hey, thanks for calling me back. I know what I said, but I can't be back in Florida right now. No, no, no, no. I know it's a great opportunity. I just, uh... I think there's an opportunity for me here. Bye. Everything okay? Ah, unfortunately no. There's been a report of a massive snow fight in our yard. Take cover, Gabs. I'm gonna get you. I'm gonna get you. Yeah. Geraldine? She needs lots of sunshine, lots of water, but mostly she needs a lot of love. I thought maybe she should belong to you. Thank you, Angie. You're welcome. Can I water her now? Yeah, that's a great idea. She's lookin' kinda thirsty. Hi, Aunt Lily. Well, hello. Hi, Angie. Good morning. Hello. It's 3:00 PM. Time has no meaning to me anymore. How much water do I put in? I better go check on Geraldine before she needs a lifeguard. So big day tomorrow, you excited? Mm-hmm. And a little nervous. David and Gabby are some tough competition. It's too bad they won't be here to enjoy it if they win. What do you mean? Oh, you know, David's promotion back in Florida. I wish they could at least stay for Christmas, but I guess they need him in the office the day after, so. That's so soon. I know. Actually, I have to admit, I'm a little disappointed. David said there was nothing between you two, but I kinda hoped there was. I guess I let my imagination run away with me. Yeah, that's uh, that's funny. Uh, you know what, Lily? I actually have to get back to the nursery. Will you tell David and Gabby I said goodbye? Yeah, I'm sure they'll be right back. Blair's waiting for me, so. Okay, see you tomorrow. Uh, where's Angie? Hey, you leaving? Uh, I need to get back to the nursery. Blair's waiting for me. I was hoping we could talk. About your promotion? How did you know about that? Lily told me. Congratulations, that's uh, that's really great news. - Actually, um- - I'm sure you're ready to get home, back to your real life. I'm sure Gabby's excited to see her friends. - Well, I... - You know it's for the best. I've spent way too much time away from the nursery, so, it's time I start focusing on what really matters. It's been really great catching up with you, but it's time we both get back to our real lives. Right, real life. Tell Gabby I'll see her tomorrow. Angie... Good luck tomorrow. You, too. David, is everything okay? Of course. I just didn't want to leave all this with you to clean up. I meant is everything okay with you and Angie? There is no me and Angie. She has her store and her dad here in Greenpine Grove. And I have a promotion and Gabby in Florida. It's about time we all get back to our real lives. Real lives? That's what she said. David... I better put this back in the basement. Hey, Lita, how are ya? There we go. Oop. All right, I think that's everything. Hi. Hi. I just wanted to say it's been fun competing against you. Angie? Hey, Gabby. It's been fun being in this competition with you, too. Do you want to talk about it? There's nothing to talk about. I always knew he was planning on going back to Florida. Well, maybe there's more to the story. Well, if there was then he would have told me himself. I had to find out he was leaving from his sister. - Angie. - Blair. Please. I just wanna focus on the contest. For my mom. It's gonna look beautiful, Angie. Thank you. I think it's exactly what she would've wanted. Attention, everyone. Welcome to the 21st Annual Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights Christmas Tree Decorating Finals! Today's winning tree will be featured in our annual tree lighting tomorrow night for Christmas Eve. The theme for the final round has been the same since the very first competition, the meaning of Christmas. And remember, part of the judge's decision is based on the votes of you, the audience. Contestants ready? On your marks. Get set. Decorate! Time. Voting begins now. We will announce the winners at 5:00. It's beautiful, Ang. I couldn't have done it without you. Angie, Blair, my goodness. Please tell me about your tree. Well, my favorite memories of Christmas are of my mom baking, wrapping presents, decorating. She always made sure everyone around her had the best Christmas possible. So, I wanted to decorate this tree in her memory. Roses were her favorite. Honoring my mom and what Christmas meant to her, it's what Christmas means to me. Well, I have to say, you've outdone yourselves. It's simply beautiful. - Thank you. - Thank you. David, Gabby, another beautiful presentation. Tell me about your tree. Well, this Christmas was, uh... different than the last couple of years. We decided we couldn't pick just one thing to represent the meaning of Christmas. So, we have ornaments of everything we did this Christmas. Decorating the tree, drinking hot chocolate, and building a snowman. Well, it is simply superb. Beautifully done, David and Gabby. Thank you for your tree. Thank you. Let's have one more round of applause for our finalists. This has been the toughest decision I've made in my years as a judge. It came down to the voters and they had a clear favorite. Can I have a drumroll, please? The winners of the 21st Annual Greenpine Grove Town Square Christmas Eve Festival of Lights Christmas Tree Decorating Contest Finals The Meaning of Christmas are... Angie Waldron and Blair Baulin. Oh, congratulations Angie and Blair on your beautiful tree and on capturing the meaning of Christmas. Remember, the tree lighting is tomorrow night at six o'clock. We'll see you all there. Congratulations. Thank you. I'm sure it was a really close vote. Congratulations, Angie. Thanks, Gabby. You know, meeting you was the best part of this whole experience. Do you want to come get hot chocolate with us? Uh, you know what? I actually have to be somewhere, but you guys have fun, okay? Gabby, I know if your mom were here right now she would be so proud of your decorating. Take good care of Geraldine, okay? Come here, Gabs. I've got some good news. What? We're going back to Florida. What? I got a new job and school's about to start again soon. You get to see all your friends. What's wrong, sweetie? I thought you'd be excited. What about Aunt Lily? She'll come visit. She's taking us to the airport tomorrow. Tomorrow? We have to get back, Gabs. I start my new job right away. We can't leave tomorrow. What about Angie? We can't leave without telling her goodbye. - Gabby. - What about the tree lighting? You promised. Okay. We can stay for the tree lighting, okay? You can say goodbye to Angie. It's gonna be for the best, Gabs. You'll see. Everything all right, sweetheart? Yeah. Why do you ask? Well, mainly because your gingerbread house is lookin' more like a gingerbread pile. Sorry, I'm just a little distracted. Would this have anything to do with David? I knew this Christmas was going to be tough. But then David and Gabby came here, and I just thought maybe... And now I'm losing them, too. Ang. All I wanted for Christmas this year was to win that contest and decorate the tree in Mom's honor. And you did. So why does it feel like something is still missing? I don't know, Ang. Dad, I miss Mom so much. I do, too, sweetheart. I do, too. Hey, did I ever tell you about our first Christmas with your mom? Well, your mom had just started the nursery. And I was trying to support us as a new teacher. Broke doesn't begin to describe it. But your mom wanted to make sure that we had a perfect Christmas, so, she splurged and bought a turkey for Christmas dinner with all the trimmings. That sounds like Mom. So, she was cooking and I was on a ladder trying to keep the star on top of the tree. Suddenly, I lost my balance. Oh, I took the whole tree down with me. Broke half the ornaments and crushed all the presents underneath. - Oh, no. - Your mom rushed in to help me up and didn't realize she'd left the turkey where our little dog, Nellie, could reach it. Did Nellie? Oh, Nellie had the best Christmas feast of her life. And then your mom and I... Your mom and I... ended up having, sharing a can of green beans and some toast for dinner. - Sounds awful. - No. It wasn't, darling. Not at all. When I look back over all the years your mother and I shared together, all the Christmas dinners she cooked, the presents we gave each other, that first Christmas there with your mother in front of our ruined tree and no presents. It's one of my favorite memories of all. I had your mother. I had everything. And your mom did so much to make Christmas special for us. The baking, the decorating, the gifts. But Christmas isn't about the way she did things. It's about the why. She did those things for us because she loved us. We don't have your mother this year, but the one thing we do have is the love she gave us. And that is something that you'll keep forever. I love you, sweetheart. I love you, too, Dad. Now get back to work. Angie? Blair, what are you doing here? I could ask you the same thing. I thought we were closed today. I just wanted to come in and get ahead on some things. And get your mind off of some others? Angie, what happened? Things were going so well with you and David. And he's leaving tonight. He didn't tell me. And I didn't tell him... Tell him what? It doesn't matter. I have something for you. - What is this? - Present. I was gonna wait and give it to you after Christmas when we reopened, but... New aprons? Oh, I'm gonna look good in this. And it's so soft. Thanks, Ang. I still don't see what was wrong with the old ones, but... But maybe you were right. Maybe I don't have to do everything exactly the way my mom did. Maybe it's okay to let go of some things. As long as I hang on to the ones that really matter. Speaking of the ones that matter. Angie, you really need to talk to David. And why is that? Because. I don't know what to do with six dozen sunflowers if you don't. - What is this? - I may have gotten in touch with Morgan's Nursery in North Dakota. Pulled a few strings, spent a small-to-medium fortune on shipping. And gotten you your sunflowers. Blair. I just know how much it meant to you and I just wanted to show you how much you meant to me. Okay, well, this makes the aprons look very sad in comparison. Well, what are you waiting for? Let's call David. No. What? What do you say to one last decorating adventure? Where's Angie? I don't know, sweetie. Thank you all for coming this evening for the tree lighting. Before we begin, our winner, Angie Waldron would like to say a few words about her tree. Angie. Thank you, everyone. I uh, I really appreciate your votes. But I'm not so sure I deserve them. I lost my mom last year and I wanted to decorate this tree in her memory. Roses were her favorite. But I realized I was missing something. I've been so focused on trying to hold on to her memory that I almost lost sight on what she loved most about the season. The way it brings people together, families and friends, communities, strangers. So today with the help of a very special friend, I redecorated the tree to remember my mom the way I think she'd want to be remembered. As somebody who knew Christmas isn't about the way you do things. It's about the why. Christmas is because of love and love brings people together. And sometimes it means giving up what you thought you wanted to make room for something even better. This is for you, Mom. So I hope this tree brings you all as much joy as it brings me. And I hope you remember that this Christmas season isn't just about joy and hope, but it's about love. Merry Christmas. Very beautiful, honey. I am so proud of you. And I know your mother is, too. Thanks, Dad. I think real life is waiting for you. Thank you, Angie. Mm-hmm. Of course, Gabby. That was a nice speech. I actually have one more. David, for half of my life you were my best friend. You knew me better than anyone and now you're back in my life. And I don't want you to go. I want you to stay here in Greenpine Grove. I know you have your life back in Florida and you're heading home soon, but I... Something tells me we're already home. What about your job? I'll figure something out. Keep working remotely. Maybe you can hire me at the nursery. It doesn't matter where I am, Angie. Wherever it is, I just want to be there with you. Flowers. Everything was beautiful. Thank you for the flowers, Angie. Great.
