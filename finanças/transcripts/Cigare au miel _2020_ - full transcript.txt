"She felt Karim's breath on her cheek. "And under his clothes, "his hot, pungent, sweat-drenched skin. "Torn between revolt and submission, almost without realising it, "she stirred. "Semi-conscious, her groin sought out the boy's. "She clung to him, "overcome by the delicious warmth which rose up from deep inside." HONEY CIGAR Our school is looking for unique profiles. What do you have that the others don't? - You're Algerian? - Yes. It doesn't show. Because my skin's fair? What do your parents do? My father's a lawyer. My mother's a gynaecologist. Where do you think that civil war is heading? There's no future for young people. They make up 2/3 of the population. It's fertile ground for oppression and radicalization. We're caught in a trap. So... In your opinion, Algeria's going to become like... - Iran? - No. No, never. It's not a theocracy. You have family there? Of course. Almost all my family. - Your parents too? - Yes. I mean, no. My parents are here. I was born here and grew up here. So, you're French? No, I'm Algerian. Of course I'm French. The truth is, I'm not unique. I'm double. Pretty smile. Beautiful boobs, too. You had your interview? Yes. How did it go? - Good, I think. - Mm-hm. Then I'll see you next fall. What are you doing here? Don't be aggressive! I came to pick you up. Where's the car? Over there. So? - How did your interview go? - Great. - I love this school. - Good. It has more international opportunities than preparatory school! Preparatory school is so prestigious! She'll have international opportunities. I know nothing about this school. Benslimane's daughter went there. - So what? - She's doing an MBA in Boston. There's no question of Selma going to the US! Are you choosing my studies or am I? I sacrificed my career so that you could succeed. I won't let you spoil things on an impulse! I never asked you for anything. You say nothing? Objectively, I think that ECIP is a good school. My future is there. I see you've decided without me. No, Mum. It's just that... Yes. You have. - I can't choose my career? - No! - No? - Quiet. Why does she always overreact? Maybe you are not nice. The Benslimanes will ask you to marry their son. - Never! - Think it over. You said he wasn't right for me. You'd finish your studies first. This isn't the right time to discuss this. I don't want to discuss it. Good evening! - How are you? - Fine, thanks. Hello, Auntie Hafida. You're more and more beautiful. Anyway, right now, in Algeria, the thing is, to save your skin, either you jump forward in time and space and come here, or America or Japan, or you go back to the Middle Ages and stay there. I don't agree. - You're an idealist. - You're a fatalist. It's getting worse and worse. There's no solution. Now's the time to trust the people. You can't talk to extremists. Look what happened to Ayub Khan in Pakistan. - That's a counterexample. - No, it's the perfect example. It's easier to get rid of extremists politically than of a military dictator. - The people have been Islamized. - The people are Muslims, that's all. Selma, what do you think about the situation? It's important to hear from young people. I think it's crucial. Say what you think. Elections won't change much. Exactly. I'm used to your daughter siding with you. Honey, go see Selim. I'd rather stay here, Auntie. Selim! - Is he here? - Selim! - He's hiding. - 'Evening. - Hi. - You've grown! So, are those business schools one big party? I don't know. Meriem's not like that. No. My sister's a nun. She doesn't do all that. She's doing an MBA? Yes, she's graduated. She's marrying a Yank she met in college. Great. Yeah, I'll be an uncle. She's not a nun, then! How about we kiss? - What? - Let's kiss. Just once. Are you crazy? Come on, just to try. I'm sure you'll like it, too. I'm going. Just a sec, to give it a try. We won't tell a soul. We're eating. Come here, you. - Are you crazy? - I swear, nothing happened. Did he deflower you? Don't say that, I hate that word! You didn't lead him on? I said nothing happened! You're lying. Hafida said Selim got thrashed! Look, I don't know what his father said. He's nuts! I don't understand. I clearly explained before we got there. I needed you to be exemplary, and it ends with a scandal! This is absurd. No-one died. What if Hafida talks? Everyone in Algiers will know. - So what! - So what? Don't you understand? People talk, Selma. Your reputation will be ruined. Is that what you want? Let them think what they want. Don't be stupid! School is what matters. Then, you can marry a Frenchman, an Algerian, an American, I don't care! In the meantime, I want no more shameful incidents with boys. Otherwise, you'll answer to your father. Is that clear? Sleep well. Happy to be one of us? Do we know each other? No...you're right. We never met on the day of your exams? No, it wasn't you. You're right. It wasn't me. Julien. - And who aren't you? - Selma. What year are you in? It's my final year. Bummer, huh? Yep. We only have a few months to fall madly in love. This isn't William. I'm not Selma. Selma. Where's that from? Not very French. You Lebanese? - William isn't very French either. - Don't mind me. Where you from? Algeria. - Algeria? - Mm. - You don't look like it. - Seriously? You don't look French either. You're hot for an Arab. I'm not hot and I'm Kabyle. You're not from here. I'm leaving. So soon? I just started not getting to know you. - You want a beer? - No, thanks. Against your religion? No, I just don't like cheap beer. Ah, the Moroccan girl doesn't like cock! She doesn't like cock! I do like cock! Selma, we're listening. Fuck me. Yeah, I love it. - Harder. - Shit! My cock is cold. It wants to be warm. Marrakech, show us your stuff. Your grandma's a better fuck! - Come on, newbie! - Newbie! Come on! Come on, you whore, on all fours, so I can see you good. There! That's better. Stop it! Virgin! Virgin, virgin, virgin! You can tell she's never done it. Let's go. You want me, don't you? Oh, yes! - Come on. - You want my tight pussy? Is that what you want? You want it bad? Come on, then. Come inside me. Yes, like that. Oh, yes, that's it. Harder. Come on... Come on. Oh, yes, I like it! Take me, I'm your bitch. Yes! - Hello? - Hello, Dad? - Are you okay? - Can you hear me? - Yes. Are you all right? - Yes, I'm fine. - Are you sure? - I'm fine. How are things there? I'm doing most of my meetings from home... Dad... Dad. Listen... Promise... promise you won't go to Kabylia. It's too dangerous! If there's any danger, I'll stay home, okay? Yes. - - All right? - Yes, okay. Everybody come inside We're gonna make you feel all right Come along and take the ride We're gonna make you feel all right Feel all right Feel all right, feel all right. How's it going? Fine. Sorry about the hazing. I couldn't stop them. How was your trial? Not too hard? I thought it was cute. Sorry we weren't up to your expectations. There wasn't quite enough sodomy. Okay. Okay, okay. What? You don't like it? You must not use enough lubricant. She never stops! In your head, in your head Zombie, zombie Zombie-ie-ie What's in your head? In your head Zombie, zombie Zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh Another mother's breaking heart Is taking over. Sorry. I didn't ask if I could not kiss you. You can't. - I can't kiss you? - Mm-mm. - Not at all? - Mm-mm. Ever? It's the same old theme Since 1916 In your head, in your head They're still fighting With their tanks and their bombs And their bombs and their guns In your head, in your head They are dying In your head, in your head Zombie, zombie Zombie-ie-ie. Should we go to bed? Yes, but we're not sleeping together. You don't want to? No, I don't want to. Well, okay. Opa! Opa! - Some chicken stock? - Yes, thanks. Put your plate down. Thanks, that's enough. No chicken, thanks. Some chicken? It's delicious. Mm-hm. You added...lemon? Right? You added lemon? No. - Pardon? - No. It's less greasy. Why do I spend hours shopping and cooking? Where do you live? Not far from here. William is crashing there too. Mm. And you? In Neuilly. I crash at my parents' place. Neuilly-sur-Seine? Neuilly-sur-Seine! Huh? - Why? - Nothing. I understand better. No, you don't. What do you understand? Nothing. I see. Everything. Where do your parents live? In the projects. No way. Yes. I understand better, too. Understand what, Sherlock? Why you're not like them. Like who? My parents? No. Like William and the other guys. Who are you like? No-one. No-one. - Are you okay? - Mm-hm. Call your folks. Stay at my place. I can't. I'm going. Why? Because I have to go. Already? What time is it? - 11:30. - You leaving already? No way, stay. Got another dick to suck? Several. Except yours. Who's up for a foursome? You idiot. Fine. A threesome? - You into it? - I'm out of here. Come on! She's full of talk, but she never does anything. What are you doing? Stop overreacting. You're acting like a frightened virgin. You're not a virgin, are you? Huh? - You're not a virgin? - Stop it. Then stay. Look at me. Next Saturday, you come over, and we'll hang out alone. - I'll see. - It's not a question. Stop it! - You stay here. - Okay. Come here! - Where were you? - At Giulia's. What time did we say? - Midnight. - What time is it? - I don't know, 1am? - 2am! Don't play with me. - Why didn't you call? - I lost track of time. - I lost track... - What were you doing? - Nothing! I was with my friends. - What friends? - Kids from school. - They have names. Who are they? - Speak! - Giulia, Am√©lia, Julie... You don't seem very sure. - I'm not lying... - Stop! The neighbours will hear! So what? You care what the neighbours think? The French, is that it? What does that mean? You're mixing everything up. Don't invent false problems. - Turn around. - No. Turn around...Selma. Out of my sight. Go to your room. Your behaviour is shameless! Come here. You promised to be home at midnight. I lost track of time. Your father risks his life daily to meet his clients in Algiers. Do you think he wants trouble at home? So, I have to stay locked up here? I didn't say that. Do you want him to leave us? - The anus! - I'm embarrassed. No! - I am. - You don't like that. No, I think it's a matter of respect. I find it... She's the one asking. - He doesn't want to, does he? - No. That's not good, you have to please women. And grant them their wishes. No, sexual intercourse works both ways. Hand down what? A plot of land she'll never use? You think she'd ever live there? One, you don't know. Two, it'll be her choice. So, buy it. Why do you ask my permission? And why not invest even more, build something there, maybe move there yourself? You always threaten me with divorce. The filters are in there. A country with daily assassinations and bombings. William, wake up. What's she doing here? - Dude, we're out of beer. - Can you go buy some? And take your time. Come over here. Let me take my shoes off. Got any siblings? Yeah, two little brothers. Are you close? Yes, they're my brothers. Got any cousins? Lots, yes. See them often? We can do my family tree if you like! I have crayons, pastels, everything! Whatever you want! Stop it! - Where were you? - Calm down. - I was at the library! - I'm not a fool! You were at the library till 11pm?! You're driving us crazy! She thinks we're stupid! 11pm! Stop it, I'll... I'll kill myself! Is that what you want? You want me to kill myself? I'll do it! - I will! - Think of the neighbours! I love you! Calm down, please. Come here. It's okay. How are you? Look at me. Look at me. It's okay. Let me see you. Look at me. Sit down. I'll handle this. Why are you reacting like this? You're acting crazy. What do you expect? She disrespects us, and you let her get away with it. She has to go out occasionally. She's not going out any more, is that clear? - It's over. - It's impossible. - You'll see. - She'll become an old maid. I don't want her going out any more! When will I see you? Come over tonight. I have to revise. Tomorrow night, then? It'd be cool if you stayed over. Now that you two have fucked, how about a threesome? - Shut up. - Cut it out. - Tomorrow night? - I'll see. I love morning sex. You're such an asshole. I'm joking. No, I won't go back to your shithole. Know what? We are done. Selma... Selma... You two should fuck. You're perfect together! Hey, Selma! "During the struggle... "without her knowing how... "..Karim's hand found itself by her mouth. "Her teeth bit into his dark skin. "The boy uttered a cry of pain, "echoed by Scheherazade's triumphant laughter. "She said haughtily... "'..Even the fly can sting the lion's eye.' "He furiously threw himself onto her, pushing aside her arms. "'Now, princess, "tell me. "Who is the winner?'" We're eating. They're here! I don't want to meet him. It's very informal. It's just a family friend passing through. How convenient! You're of an age to marry. It's only natural. You know we're against arranged marriages. Well, you're arranging a meeting! It's just a dinner. There's no pressure. Come on, please. I've made couscous for Eid. It comes from Adam Smith, I think. Yes, pragmatism started with Adam Smith. Bentham founded utilitarianism if I remember correctly. Some more whisky, Luka? It's very good. It's from Scotland. Karim? Don't worry. It's hard to drive on the left, but you get used to it. Luka. - What does that guy do? - Luka? You like him now? He works in an investment bank. He's fluent in English, Italian, German, and Arabic. Does that suit you? I didn't ask for his pedigree! I think he's perfect. - More? - Yes, all of it. You could've worn high heels to please me. Hey... Stay reserved. Let's eat. Things are progressing. I didn't think it'd go so fast. A fine career. But there's still work to do. I got what I wanted. Your dad must be proud. We're both proud. He's done very well. We're pleased for him. Luka... - More sauce? - I have enough. Thank you. My darling, this couscous is delicious. Divine! Very good. I'm sorry. No, thanks. I think the wine is going to my head. Selma, your father tells me you want an internship in finance? That's right. For this summer. My school requires us to find internships. Well, Luka... works in finance, I think you've understood. He started in the bank... of his esteemed father. That's right. He started with me. You're now with the Deutsche Bank? Yes. A fine bank. I'm based in London, but I still have contacts in Paris. I could try... to find you an interesting internship. That would be very kind of you. Great. I'll leave you my card. They're in my jacket. Excuse me. Delicious couscous. Excellent. Well done. - It takes 8 hours to make it. - Really? - Amazing. - I want the recipe. It's my mother's. Some more meat? - Our son. - He hasn't left yet? Good. That's my name. My direct line. That's the main number. Call me in the next fortnight. I LOVE YOUR SMILE! It'd be a shame to miss you. - Luka? - Yes, please. Make the most of it. See what he offers, then see if you like him. It's an interview, Mum. It's not just that, I think he likes you. - Welcome, miss. - Hello. Hi, there. Thanks for coming. What's this? My r√©sum√©. I'll look at it later. Let's talk about you. Your parents are from Tizi Ouzou? Yes, near Tizi Ouzou. - And you were born here? - Yes. My parents moved here before I was born. - Do you go back? - Whenever I can. Even at the moment? My dad gets a bit worried. I understand. I don't. It's the best way to hand the country over to them. You have no choice. I hope I do. - Do you want to fight? - No. I want to keep going. It's not Iran or Afghanistan. Is sparkling water okay? We know the Afghans train and finance them. - That's not news to you. - It doesn't come from us. Who is "us"? You're not them. Sure I am. I just have to look at you. I can see you weren't raised like them. So? It's not your reality. Is it yours? You're cute when you're angry. - I'm not a kid, you know. - I know. Look, I have to go. I'd like to invite you to dinner. - In a restaurant. - Yes, okay. There's a certain Julien on the phone for you. I'm out. Turn around. Do up another button. That's better. - Your high heels? - They hurt my feet. Put on your high heels! - So, you're honest? - Always. Really? I've drunk too much. - What are you doing? - Taking my shoes off. - What about dinner? - What? - What about dinner? - Are you hungry? I'll order something. No... A meal out. It's late. Let's stay here. The food's great. - What would you like? - I'll go. - If you're not hungry... - No, wait. Come on, how about a pizza with truffle topping? What is it? Don't you like me? You're so pretty... So proud. - Stop it. - Hang on. What are you doing? Wait. Wait, wait... It's too late. Hey, hey, hey... You'll go home naked under your dress. Stop it. You're so fucking pretty. Honey? Yes. I'm going to bed. Wait. Okay, honey? - Are you okay? - Mm-hm. Fine. It's a bit late. We talked a lot. Come here. Go on. So? How did it go? - Did it go well? - Mm. Are you meeting again? I think so. I don't know. We'll see. We could invite him over. Why not? Give me time to think about it. But did it go well? Yes, I told you it did. Good. I'm going to bed. I'm exhausted. Give me a kiss. - 'Night, Dad. - 'Night, honey. Can I come in? I'm sleeping, Mom. Good evening. Whoever you choose, he'll be as wonderful as you. A Toumi marrying your daughter isn't so bad. - Why? He's a Toumi? - Yes, it's Luka. The banker's son. With the Swiss woman. So, he's free, like you. Meaning? He must travel a lot and... His attitude is... - Open-minded? - Right. Keep this to yourself. It's not done yet... And it won't be. What's that, Mum? Did you ask what I wanted? Of course I did. Didn't you say you hit it off? You two like him. I won't get married. Look... It's simple. You won't see him again. We're not forcing you to get married! So, let's change the subject. Of course you're forcing me. You all are! - She has your character. - I agree. It's not always easy. Don't pretend. That's a criticism. Not at all. I think it's a quality. You'd like your wife like that? Easier to have a mistress! Watch your mouth. Enough! - Don't talk stupid. - I'm not the one being stupid. - You should be ashamed. - No! My daughter shouldn't be ashamed of anything, okay? Or anyone. Is that clear? - What is your real problem here? - I think you've said enough tonight. So, get up, we're going. Dad has decided. - We're going. - Hurry or he'll leave you! Hafida, I'm sorry. She's not her usual self. Yeah, say sorry. Say sorry for existing, too. You shut up now! Think what you like about me and your dad. But don't ruin your life by failing your exams. What's the point of studying if marrying is all that counts? Your grandma wants a word. Hello, Yaya. How are you, my girl? Okay. I don't know what's going on, but I'll tell you something I've never forgotten. When you were born, your mother would carry you everywhere... ..in a big scarf I gave her. She even took you to the bathroom. One day, you must have been a year old... ..she was offered a job doing research. I forget the details. But it meant travelling between Paris and Algiers. She stroked your back and said, "No, I won't leave my baby." Even if you're now bigger than her, you'll always be in her heart. If you won't eat, nor will I. I told your father I wanted to let you go out. I don't care. That's not the issue. Your friends called. They keep calling. Who is this Julien? No-one. They asked if you were going to your school graduation party. Is it to say goodbye to the graduates? They asked if you'd go. - Have you seen Julien? - Who? - Julien? - No, sorry. Say yeah, say yeah, say yeah Now I'm gonna move away, yeah Now I'm gonna move away, yeah Say yeah, say yeah Say yeah, say yeah. Say yeah, say yeah Say yeah, say yeah. Take it higher Take it higher Take it higher Oh, yeah Feel it. - Are you okay? - Yes. Her results, Dr Merabet. Her blood pressure's back up. Will she have any after-effects, Doctor? No. The problem is her fall, not why she blacked out. Doctor, are you sure she won't have any after-effects? I can't say any better than Dr Merabet. Selma was lucky she didn't have any head injuries or broken teeth. Now you need to rest, okay? Pleased to meet you, Doctor. - Thank you. - Goodbye. It's incredible that you doubt me. - Especially about my daughter. - I listened to you. No, you didn't. She was a gynaecologist, after all. I asked the doctor who examined you. I wanted his opinion. It's only natural. You rest, honey. I don't need to rest. No. You disrespected Mum. It was embarrassing. Look, let's not get angry. Not again! You're the one getting angry. Selma... What are you doing? You sleeping here? Leave me alone. Go to bed. Give me the remote. 'Night, honey. Selma, please go to bed. They say girls often want to marry a man like their father. Not me. I found some land in Kabylia. What land? The one I wanted to buy. Auntie found us a good plot. "Us"? It has nothing to do with me. It does. I'll sign it over to you. Mum, I don't want it. What would I do with it? We'll go there on vacation so you can see it. Will we really? Yes. Didn't Dad say it's too dangerous? I think it's dangerous for you not to go. KABYLIA, ALGERIA - Hello. - Hello. Open the trunk. Okay. - Where are you going? - Beni Yenni. Visiting family. Be quick, there are terrorist groups at Mekla. Thank you, brother. Is this it? Yes. - Don't go too far. - Leave her alone. Filthy creature! Disgusting! It is disgusting, Yaya. There aren't normally any cockroaches here. They came along with the terrorists. That's another reason to leave here, Mum. No, I'm staying. Leave here? There are no doctors here any more. I'm staying. I won't go to Algiers. No-one will come. It's too dangerous. No, I'm staying. You'll look after me here. I won't go to Algiers. I'm staying here. Look, your house is falling down. You can't keep it. No, I'm staying here. You'll look after me here. - You'll visit me. - Listen... Your mother has an idea in the back of her mind. What idea? I want to start working again. Really? I'll reopen my practice in Algiers. - What? - I'll reopen my practice in Algiers. That's right. I've done a lot of thinking lately. It's the best thing to do. No. You must look after your daughter and your husband over there. Did Mum say she wants to work in Algiers? Dad! You can't let her. Please, say something! Dad... We can't live without Mum. I can't stop her... I can't. You two are ridiculous! You can't respect Mum, and she just destroys everything! ISLAMIC STATE - We can't go this way. - Yes, we can. Come on. We're going home. I'm going home. Excuse me. ALGIERS, ALGERIA There are bombings every day. You can't risk your life here! Yes, I will risk my life here. Women here can't be treated by male doctors any more. I know what I'm doing. I'm protected. Nobody is. I need you, Mum. I know. But not like before. You're strong. Don't depend on anyone. A man died today in Algeria because he was a moderate Muslim intellectual, a professor and head of a parent-teacher association. He was Rabah Stambouli. He rebelled against the latest threats from the Armed Islamic Group who, two weeks ago, called for a boycott of all schools. We get the reaction of Algerian intellectual and writer Rachid Mimouni. It's the strategy of all these terrorist groups. Their aim is to eliminate the whole race of intellectuals, so to speak. Algeria is going through a totally unique situation. Children face death for going to school. How could I be okay? Whenever I listen to the news... That's exactly what they want. Don't worry. I'm always very careful. I wanted to tell you to be brave tomorrow. No need. Well, we'll need to be brave... to live so far apart. I miss you, Mum. I miss you, too. Every moment. I know it's the only way for you to live your life. Understand? That goes in there. This goes here. I did it in the end. I'm going out tonight. What for? Where to? No reason. No special reason. Your internship starts tomorrow. Get an early night. I know. Will you start going out all the time? Would you rather I lied to you? How many times a week? I don't know. But you mustn't worry, okay? How do you expect me not to worry? You nearly missed me. - Are you moving? - Yeah. I got a posting. I'm going to Singapore tomorrow. - For how long? - 16 months. Was it good for you? Mm-hm. Sure? Yeah. I know you. What's up? Nothing. You could come visit me in Singapore. What for? To see me. You're smitten! You come back. I don't think I can, Selma. Nor do I, Julien. It's not 'cause of you. Same here. I won't follow you there. I won't not miss you. What are you doing? Here. Are you sure? "The soft tongue delved inside her." "The strong hands clasped her hips... "as she writhed against his fleshy lips "so that, in this humid embrace... "it was her, "Scheherazade... "..who imposed her own rhythm." TO MY MOTHER
