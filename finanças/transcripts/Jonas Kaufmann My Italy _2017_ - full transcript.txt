For me, Italy is the land of nostalgia. Like many Germans, I spent my first family holidays here and I've been coming back regularly ever since. As soon as I get here, I find myself humming and singing to myself all the time, not just Verdi or Puccini, but also the all-time great Italian hits, from Caruso to Pavarotti, Modugno and Lucio Dalla. I adore those songs! What about a little musical trip? Come with me! I was incredibly fortunate fo come to Italy at such an early age, this celebrated land where the lemon trees blossom. Goethe wasn't the only one to talk of it so enthusiastically. During the 1950s and 60s, Italy was the main tourist destination for German families. All those who had the means would drive over the Brenner Pass to go and savour the atmosphere of this blessed country. I think it was my grandfather who started it all and urged the family to go the first time. For me, it became natural to go two or three times a year, to enjoy and make the most of an entirely different life. Today, of course, when I find myself on the Italian coast, I immediately think of those wonderful days that my sister and I spent at the beach with our parents. My father filmed us regularly and when [ look at those Super 8s today I feel recall that very special sense of happiness that we no doubt only experience during a carefree childhood. The sun, the sea, those hours at the beach... It was heaven for us kids. Not to mention those delicious ice creams, the likes of which didn't even exist in Germany at that time. My sister and I spent hours playing table football and if it had been up to us, those wonderful summers in Iltaly would never have come to an end. My Italy... Even today it stirs a sense of joy inside me. I sense it as soon as I'm at the beach, I sense it when I take off my shoes and feel the sand under my feet. I sense it when the warm air and the smell of the sea waft over me. I'm almost as happy as when I was a little boy. In that sense, Italy for me isn't just la dolce vita, it's also an untouched little corner of the world. I was incredibly fortunate to come to Italy starting at such an early age But the dolce far niente on the beach was only half of our holidays in Italy. The rest of the time we got to know the country and the people and discovered its towns and cities. These were genuine cultural trips that my father planned meticulously. Today, I often return to those beautiful old towns. I simply stop in a region that I don't know yet and see what I can discover walking around. Perhaps a nice little cafe with a wonderful espresso or a shop with old music books. When [ stroll the streets and hear the hubbub and car horns, I often try to imagine what those places looked like in the era of Rossini, Verdi or Puccini, and how they sounded then. Sometimes, you get the impression that time has stopped. You can literally sense the centuries of history at every street corner and in the next street another page of history begins. Often I'm the one on stage, but here, in Italy, I make the most of my role as a spectator. I could watch the scenes of everyday life in the towns incessantly. It's grand theatre, the actors are just seated outside. They all participate in a game where everyone watches life pass by in all its glory. The people here have their own theatricality and live without any fake inhibitions, with all their gestures, their voices, their passions. We see plenty of inspiring things for the stage here and we can understand why music represents something existential here. In general, music has an incredible capacity to influence us in terms of what we feel and perceive. And if it is music that triggers a particular memory and rekindles a specific moment of happiness, I'd say that it is a magic key to the soul, a key that works every time. And the voice is an amplification of the music. It's the instrument because of which, and with which, music was no doubt invented. The voice existed long before anyone created instruments. It has always existed. And it is also the most direct road from one soul to another. That is something we've inherited from our ancestors, the instinct to feel all that. In the end, it's a decisive factor for us singers when we perform a song: we need to include these feelings, these genuine feelings in our song, to achieve a specific emotional effect on the audience, on the listener. Despite all my enthusiasm for Italy, I know the country sufficiently well to realise that these images only show the good sides. Of course, I'm also aware of the darker side. Whether it be corruption, the mafia or the countless annoying little things, I don't close my eyes to them, but they're part of the country. Nevertheless, we could learn one thing from the Italians: in spite of all that irritates us, weighs upon us or depresses us, we should remain open to all the wonderful things we unexpectedly encounter in everyday life. For the espresso addict that I am, Italy is obviously the promised land. I willingly leave my coffee machine at home and enjoy a delicious espresso in a bar. I'm always fascinated to watch a real barista make an espresso. And I feel a childlike pleasure when a perfect coffee gushes like thick chocolate. That too is a little instant of happiness. I often chat with the Italian bartenders to discover their secrets and their tricks. The right pressure, the right temperature, the hardness of the water, the compression of the coffee... You can't imagine how many there are! I really miss all that when I travel to other countries. I sometimes find myself in a hotel room and dream of being in an Italian bar and enjoying a really good coffee. I needn't mention the wonderful cuisine in Italy. I far prefer a pizza or pasta in a good Italian restaurant to an elegant dinner. In Italy, you learn to make the most of life's daily joys. And I have also learned something else here: when you're on stage, don't pretend! Here feelings are genuine! I learnt that from the great director Giorgio Strehler. He demanded total spontaneity and unconditional, absolute passion from us, and that is strongly burnt into me. What began with our holidays in Italy when I was still a little boy has remained with me all my life: a longing for harmony and happiness. And perhaps in a way a search for paradise lost. When I look back, I have to say that it was this longing that led me to music. Because music allows us to rediscover a lost paradise, even if only for a fleeting moment when we become like children once more:; carefree, open and receptive to everything that is good for us. The love of Italy and a love of music: my family cultivated both, and both fell on fertile ground in my case. I'm grateful for this huge personal and professional opportunity. What might have been the course of my life without those early experiences of the language, the music, the culture and joie de vivre of the Italians? I feel at home in their country and I feel they have adopted me as an artist. Perhaps not only because I speak Italian, but also because they sense I understand and appreciate their emotional language. They have taught me not to be ashamed of my feelings. And I'm convinced of this: only by fully accepting our own feelings can we reach and touch others through music. Music is the key to the soul. I's an international language that everyone speaks and understands. It can have an effect like nothing else and which I think we always underestimate. I think we can achieve a lot of things through music. Maybe not complete world peace, but at least a step in that direction, if we use it sensibly.
