[gentle orchestral music] [cityscape sounds] [can spraying] Sodding religion. [knocking] [clock ticking] Archie. [Archie] That's me. I'm Jonathan Cole, I'm in charge of this trip. Good luck to you, mate. [school bell rings] [children chattering] Oh yeah yeah yeah, he said he was back before all that. Where do they get the money? Oh, you've got a- Mm? It's a- Oh. Thank you. [students beatboxing] * Missing a day of school to go on a trip to * * Salisbury cathedral, you know who * * Got a teacher Mr. Harvey, that grumpy old man * * The guy that can't grin, that boredom fan * * It's the happy Mr. Happy you gotta get snappy * * That tie is really rank, I'm telling you it's crappy * What is that tie sir? It's like waffle toast, man. Used to be the height of fashion. You should concentrate on doing your own tie, Sydney Williams. * Yo Miss Davis in the house * * Be sharp as a lizard, be quiet as a mouse * Thank you Sydney, now go and join the queue. [students beatboxing] Who are these people? Look at them. -They are ugly. -[students shouting] You say something then? Is everyone looking forward to this trip? Go motherfucker. [water squirting] Look what you did. Perfect day for an international. Sir. Whoa, Davey Scorsese. Want to say something about this trip, sir? You're asking the wrong man. Sir, want to say something about today? What's that? It's a camera, sir. Like on the tele? I'm making a kind of religious trip documentary type thing, with interviews and stuff, you know, find out what people believe. It's good to see you found some enthusiasm for the subject. So you say you've seen every cathedral in England. How does Salisbury rate? I mean, is it up there? It is up there. Yes. When did you last see it? Sir? Hmm? No, it was sometime ago. Maurice, Maurice! Give me the gun. Well, I'm quite looking forward to it. We atheists need our God fix too, you know. This could come in handy. [students screaming] Last chance to go to the toilet. I think they're ready to get on board, if you are. Send them on. Okay, take your seats. One at a time, slowly. No pushing, no pushing, no pushing, slowly. One at a time. No pushing. Oi, watch my cushions. You're evil. [students bustling] Saving it for the majesty? Maybe. Why? Do you want to keep it warm for her? Got some stuff? Enough for two. Come on, respect. Hey, Assama, what's in your bag? Okay Mo. You might want to check his bag, sir, he might have a bomb in there. Hey, you think about that. Is that funny? Yeah, maybe if you got a sense of humour, that is. Get on. [student giggles] Has anyone seen Helen? She's probably down boots, sucking up for razors. [students laughing] Or Johnnys. [students laughing] Ah, here she comes. [students chattering] Record this piece, record it! About time. All right, that's everyone. See how the males of the species respond to the lovely Helen Taylor. Hey, hey, hey. Ork. Tart. Does a day's modelling, she thinks she's Kate Moss. Such a bitch. All right, my name's Archie. I'm your captain for the day. * Captain Archie shirt all starchie * * When you gonna get a starchie? * [students laughing] Oi, you listen at the back there. You may be off school, but when you're on this coach, I'm the headmaster. Wa, wa, wa. Few ship's rules, keep it nice and simple for you. I've got three, three L's. No litter, no lip and no lovey-dovey. Especially down the back there. And no licking? [students laughing] So keep it sweet. And keep your sweets of my seats. Sweet. Okay. Guys. Right, it's two and a bit hours to Salisbury, so we should be there in time for lunch. When we get there, let's not have any wandering off. I don't want a repeat of Chessington. [students laughing] Okay, Mr. Harvey wants a quick word. [students moaning] Quiet! * Happy happy at all * * Happy birthday to you * Catherine, I don't know if you'd be so kind as to distribute these. All right, you'll be enthralled to know that I've printed out a sheet for you. Sheet. It gives you all the salient points about the cathedral. When it was built, how tall the spire is, that sort of thing. It's 404 feet, sir. Oh, you can read Morris. You're really coming on. [students laughing] It is 404 feet, yes, but hopefully you'll see that it's more than just a tall, old building. I'll be giving a talk when we get there. But if you have any questions, just ask. Sir, do we have to go on this trip? [students laughing] Have they got cocaine in Salisbury, sir? * Coo-Cai * Cook who? Coocoo. Sir, how much further? All right. That's enough now. Are you done? I need to use the toilet. Tough. [engine starting] [cheerful music] * Talking talking happy talk * * I'm not gunna pull this off man without signing the dots * * Too dream * * We got to have a dream * * This is too sensible for me man * * If we don't have a dream * * Have you ever had a dream come true? * Start the singing. * I used to dream about crazy little things like fame * * In the days hanging outside the off licence * * We used to run around the streets * * Reckless with no shame * * Mainly up to no good * * A whole world of nonsense * * And I was dead sure that I knew it all * * The whole world got my attitude I nearly blew it all * * I find it a real big struggle getting through it all * * I swear I didn't wanna listen cause I sure didn't care * * Not knowing for reality that I'd have to prepare * * Cause money don't grow on no stick * * Well it's rare * * Being broke was looking less and less the lick * * Plus I was growing up, life was looking as a scare * * I've been talking talking happy talk * You do many school trips, Archie? Prefer corporate. Pays better. You get tipped. You don't get kids messing up the upholstery. Something usually goes wrong on school trips. It's a law. Took a party from Ronford to France. Two kids bunked off, missed the ferry. Stuck there for two days. Buggers had checked into a hotel and went using the parent's credit cards. Right. I might not do with the old school trip. Usually when I want to see something I haven't seen. Like that time I got to see that Mont-Saint-Michel. Now, that is a sight. Gotta be the most amazing cathedral in the world. Technically Mont-Saint-Michel is a monastery. Well, it's pretty spectacular, whatever it is. Mind you, it's a bugger getting the coach in. Got to wait for the right tide. I'm going to spend the day a real sporting cathedral, but ivory tweaking them. Hey, maybe we should visit a stadium next year. Sport must count as a religion. It has its fanatics. You mean to say, you're not looking forward to a bit of culture, Jonathon? Brings me out in a rash. Ali fat face Cohen. Crisp taster. So how'd you feel about this trip, Ali? Does it bother you that we're going to a cathedral and not a mosque? [Ali mumbles] Hey, what about you, Mo? You're probably the only person here who actually believes in God. Think we should be visiting a mosque? A mosque is for worship, not for sightseeing. Phil Rogers, music lover, graffiti artist, police record. [students cheer] And part-time knob head. And then we've got Andy, our boy band reject and no other monkey. Give us a song, Andy. Shut your face posh spice. [students jeer] Hey Sandra, been loving any houses lately? Shut up, you tit. And here, another female preparing herself for the mating season. So Donna, you're excited about this trip to Salisbury? Wetting myself. Wow, I can't actually make that out. If you ask me, all this historic stuff's wasted on this lot. Hear hear. They got so many stimulations. DVDs, computer games and that, they're not impressed by much. All the more reason for them to see a cathedral. Give them a glimpse of something other than this. Why go see a big old building when you can build your own in SIM city? [gentle piano music] * Went to school and I was very nervous * * No one knew me, no one knew me * * Hello, teacher! Tell me, what's my lesson? * * Look right through me, look right through me * * And I find it kind of funny * * I find it kind of sad * * The dreams in which I'm dying * * Are the best I've ever had * * I find it hard to tell you * * I find it hard to take * * When people run in circles it's a very, very * * Mad world * * Mad world * [imitating religious chanting] Oi, Assama, shouldn't you be on your knees now, mate. You shouldn't say stuff like that. Oh gosh, shut up. I'd like to pray, actually. You? Why shouldn't I? Cause you're too bad. What do you know about it? God wouldn't listen to you. Who says? I pray every day. I pray that you'll- Why's it so hot in here? * Shake, shake, shake it * * Shake it like a polaroid picture * [soft chattering] So when did you last see Salisbury? Well? Hmm? Oh. 21 years ago. This month. That's very exact of you. It's um... It's when I asked Pamela to marry me. I proposed at the cathedral. [banging] [guitar music] Can you turn the heating down? We're all baking back here. Sorry darling, thermostat is stuck. But I'm really hot. You are. Nice shirt, sir. But is it safe or is it sweet? Definitely sweet. Did you get it in GAP? Hack it. Tart. Creep. What? Happy. What's he done? Looked me up. Can't blame him. Probably wants to take you back to his flat, cut you up into tiny little pieces. [laughs] Look at him, flirting with Ratty. Could you imagine him doing it? He's probably never done it. That's his problem. Hey. He kept looking at me. I'll sort him. [whimsical music] [ticking sounds] Shh, shh, shh. What's that ticking sound? It's coming from over here. It's getting louder. It's in his bag! [students shouting] [mimicking explosions] [students laughing] Let's have a look. Oi, oi, ooh wow. Nice tag. The suicide bombers manual. [students laughing] All right, all right, all right, all right. But wait, come and take it. [students jeering] Wanna sort that out? Oi! What are you doing? What's going on? Nothing. You're on a warning. What for? You've been at him all morning. Now get up at the front where I can see you. But sir. Now! [students jeering] You all right Mo? Not there, next to me. You don't sit there looking all hurt, you crossed a line. It's just a book, what's the big deal? You need to apologise. What for? You really need me to explain? Sod it. Mr. Harvey, could you explain? Explain? About religious tolerance? Is that the issue? Well what is the issue then? Need to stop at the services for a bit. Is there a problem? Just need to check something. I think a stop will do us all good. [sighs] [gentle music] Sir, I still need to use the toilet. Hang on. Do you know what it is? Some pressure is loose. Is that bad? Gonna need a bit to cool down. Well have we got time for a toilet break? We've got time for more than that. It's gonna need an hour. An hour? Tops. Well shouldn't we be getting back up? Get another coach? Like I said, you've got an hour. Okay. We're going to be here for an hour. [students cheer] Now I suggest we have lunch in the cafe. Let's all be back here by one. [soft chattering] Jesus. Bloody elephants. [dramatic orchestral music] Now this is culture. [slot machine whirs] Watch and learn. What's he doing? [students laughing] I'm going out in space. Pop it, pop it, pop it! [people chattering] That boy just can't stop niggling. Get away from me now. Hey, give those guys a turn, come on. He has no respect for other people's beliefs. Why should he? He doesn't show what he believes himself. Yeah but, come on. He was messing around with Mo's Koran. I'm sure Allah can cope. What about the others, Ali, Habib, how do you think they feel? I'm not sure they care. Well, I thought it was meant to be a sacred text. It isn't sacred to Phil, nor to you for that matter. Yeah, but I still wouldn't say anything bad about it. Why not? Have you read it? Do you believe it's the final infallible word of God revealed to Muhammad by the angel Gabriel 1300 years ago? Look, I don't want to get into a big debate. I don't care what people believe. As long as they don't harm other people. That isn't tolerance, it's indifference. No I'll get it. Three coffees, please. [students chattering] Hey, here you are. What, it's a proper job. Go on, show us what you have to do then. Why? Go on. Sure? She's got the model look, don't you think? Of what? Come on, you still got some red blood pumping in your veins. I saw you having a good look on the coach. I wasn't looking at that. Well what were you looking at then? My wallet. Have you seen my? It's not here. It can't- [emotional piano music] What if you left it on the coach? I'm not posh. Course you are. I'm not, I'm just well-spoken. Well-spoken. I got him back for ya. What? Shit. Opera. Joke. Five lousy quid. What a cheapskate. What is it? Mr. Happy? With a bird? No way. Put a paper bag over her head, she'll be all right. Mr. Happy had a woman. She was probably sister. He's got his arms around her. So what? [mysterious music] Thanks. Where's Malcolm? He's mislaid his wallet, he's checking the coach. What? He's... He's very old. I have nothing personal against him, he's just- Awkward parent you can't relate to. I don't know why insists on making these trips or why we tolerate them. His fact sheets, his little speeches are so irrelevant. You prefer they had more business studies? You know, at least it has a practical application. Every year we do the timetable, I see the mandatory area. And I think they must just stop pretending, let's drop it. Some people, people like Malcolm would argue that we're spiritual beings. Really? Is he including himself in that? Don't see much spiritual inclination with this lot, look at them. I mean we may just have well have driven them here. This'll be the highlight of the day. Hello? All right? No, I've lost my wallet. It's a brown Sable wallet. There's something important in it. Someone always loses something on a trip. It's a law. Sure you didn't lose it in the services? No, I don't think so. Well, someone could have nicked it. Won't be that surprised if it were one of your lot. Do you have to? It's for later when I'm in church. It's a cathedral. What's the difference? A cathedral makes it a city. You're beautiful, you know that? Why do you do that? Because. You crazy girl. Do you want to try? Cut myself? I got a better idea. [heavy breathing] * We is here in this mall with a broken down bus * * And a, and a, and a crap- * Wheel it DJ, start again. Hey, hey, and here is Mr. Happy. Ooh, looking for his personality. Sir? Sir? [mysterious music] What's the matter? Oh dear. Any joy? No. Too much in it? [mysterious music] Phil, we gotta go. You gonna bomb the cathedral? Okay my lot. Let's go. Let's go. Girls spice in between, let's go. Come on. Excuse me, ladies. You all look very lovely, but it's time to go. Put that down, please. Aliah, sit, give it to me, come on. Come on, let's go, let's go, let's go. Okay, Mr. Harvey has lost his wallet. [Students] Aw. What's it look like, sir? I don't know, it's a wallet. Do we get reward if we find it, sir? That's up to Mr. Harvey. [students laughing] Malcolm, we need to get going. We're running late already. What if one of them has taken it? Maybe we should search their bags. We're not getting into that now. [students singing] George, have you got Mr. Harvey's wallet? No, I said before, get the camera out my face. [students laughing] At least it didn't have anything valuable in it. It was the whole reason for the trip. What'd you mean? It had a photograph of Pamela in it. Taken the day we were engaged. I'm sorry. Anyway, it doesn't matter. So this is a kind of pilgrimage. I hadn't looked at it that way. Yes, I suppose. [student chattering] Oi, enough of that. [students moaning] No respect. God, imagine living in Jerusalem at the moment. Imagine driving a bus there. Think of the insurance. I don't see how they're ever going to sort it. Ah, I got my solution. Ban all religion. Seems a bit harsh. Think about it, though. Take a problem in the world, bet you can trace it back to religion. Middle east, Northern Ireland, ban the lot. Yeah, but religion has some good things to teach us. I mean, they're basically all preaching the same thing. It's good morals, isn't that right, Malcolm? It's the people that are the problem. Not religion. Religion makes people in another's, if you asked me. Do you seriously think that religion is the root of man's problems? Do you think that religion invented selfishness, greed, cruelty, revenge, theft? It's lazy to say that. It's also lazy to say that religions are about morals and they're all the same, they are not. They're about revelations, competing revelations. Think you could sit down? A Buddhist believe in God, but a Muslim does. A Christian believes that Jesus is the Christ. A Jew doesn't. A Muslim would consider Jesus to be a prophet, would say that it's a blasphemy to believe that he's the son of God. A Hindu believes in a multiplicity of gods and lots of people in this country don't believe in any of the above or know what it is that they believe. Well I know what I believe in. It all come down to chance in the end. [students chattering] What you looking at? Where did you get this? Shh. Who's the woman? But he actually looks all right and that's weird. Look. You should lose your wallet more often. Where did that come from? The lazy lumping together of church beliefs gets me going. So what's your position? I must have spent the best part of half my life in your company and I don't even know what you believe. My faith hangs by a very thin thread. Do you pray? I haven't prayed properly for a long time. [gentle music] [birds chirping] If you look up ahead, you'll see stone henge. Hmm, they're smaller than I remember. Is that it? What's the fascination? It's just a big bunch of rocks. I know. Looks like rubbish to me. If we took a piece of one them stones, we can make some money from it. Yeah, that's got to be worth something. Yeah. Is that the other woman? He looks really young. Is that the other woman? What's he wearing? A worm mingy? [laughing] Is that him? Is that the other woman? He was a player. That girl is laid. She ain't bad looking. Someone on this coach has taken it. You have to let it go, Malcolm. I want that photograph. Where's the photo? I don't know. Where's the photo? Look up on your left hand, you'll see the cathedral. [gentle music] [students laughing] Wait a second, wait a second, remember no one run off. We stick together okay? All right, I want to do a bag search. What, why? Now before anyone gets off this coach, I want to see your bags. We need to get them off. Open your bags, please. Open your bags. Thank you. Everybody open your bags. Oh. Maybe you lost it in the services, sir? Did it have anything valuable in it, sir? Not likely. [laughing] Why are you laughing? Tell me. What's funny? I want you to tell me what you think is so funny. Do you realise how pathetic you are? Parading yourself the way you do. You don't know anything about suffering, about life. It's all a game to you isn't it? Do you think this is a game? Doing this to yourself? Playing with your life? You're too selfish to go through with something like that. You haven't got enough courage. Malcolm. Get off. Freak! -Helen? -Helen. [Helen sobbing] Okay everyone, let's congregate on the green. Make sure you don't leave anything on the coach. Whose bag is that? Did you get all that? No. [birds chirping] [clears throat] Oh Christ, I can't believe that. What the hell were you playing at? All this over a wallet and her of all people. Look, we're just going to have to park it for now, okay? Everything all right back there? We'll be back here by four, all right? There's always one. Every trip. One of the teachers loses it. It's a law. [chuckles] * There's a bump on the bus * * Mr. Happy made a fuss * * And he screams and he cussed * * And he embarrassed us * * Wheel it * [laughs] * There's a bum on the bus * * Mr Happy made a fuss * I thought he was gonna kill her. I wish. [laughing] Giving you lip, was she? If you ask me, that girl had it coming. These kids have no discipline. I'll take a cricket bat to half of them, if I was in your shoes. Look at this mess. That's it. What? That's it. [sad violin music] Well, I'm going to have a fag. Maybe have a look at this place. Be this as good as you make out. She must've said something. Done something. He grabbed her. And you heard what he said. Most of it, true. Oh come on Fran, it was a serious incident. Maybe. I'll have to bring this up with Peter. Oh come on, Jonathan. In 20 years of teaching, I don't think I've ever seen him get angry. Well maybe that's his problem. What the hell's he doing now? It's a fine time for a flip out. You know, he was married once. Vaguely. He had a photograph of his wife in the wallet. And? She died, just before he joined the school. I think they'd been married a year. Today was some kind of pilgrimage. This is meant to be a school trip. This is ridiculous. You talk to Helen, I'll deal with him. So. Did you nick it? Whose side are you on? You all right, girls? Yeah. When we going in, sir? Soon. You all right? Helen, I need to know what happened back there. He grabbed me, didn't he? Hard, like that. She didn't do nothing, sir. I saw it, I'm a witness. Okay, but I'm asking Helen now. Now go join the others, go on. Go on. [sighs] Why did he do that to you? Did you say something? I was just laughing. Someone made a joke and I laughed. What was the joke? Just a joke. I can't even remember. And you don't know anything about the wallet? What happened? Did Helen do this? I don't know. She's a bot not. I don't know what to say, except that she probably has little idea of what she's done. No, she has no idea. I sometimes think, you've made things difficult for yourself, hanging on to this. Not ever talking about it, letting it build up, not even being able to speculate as to what happened. People don't need to know. Well I'd like to know. I don't think you realise the air of "leave me alone" you give off. Maybe you like it that way. You're like the man in the poem, the man carrying a heavy bag that he won't let anyone help him carry in case they don't recognise him without it. But to be honest, I'm fed up with not talking about it. Having to ignore the gossip and the names. Mr. Happy. On a good day. The incredible sulk. That's a good one. What did happen? You don't have to answer that. But it's time you let someone help you carry that bag or that you dropped it all together. Williams! Williams, where you going? Get back here. Did you hear what I just said? Jonathon's doing it, now come on. I've got the little matter of the school trip to save. I can't go in there. Well you have to. I can't do it. You have to. Whose gonna tell them it was built for the glory of God, me? The salient facts. Can we keep up? Come on. Miss? Is it true Mr. Harvey was married? Yes. Did Helen draw on the photos? Is that why he had a go at her? You saw the photograph? They were passing it around the coach. Who? Before you go in, did you deface that photograph? What photo? You know what I'm talking about. The photograph of Mr. Harvey and his wife. You defaced it, didn't you? I don't know anything about it. There are a lot of things you don't know about other people, you're so wrapped up in yourself. Did you do it? Don't think so, Miss. Donna, Sandra? Well, whoever did it should be ashamed of themselves. Ooh. [gentle music] Wow! Cool. I've seen it all now. [students chattering] Sir, sir. We came up with a rap from the fact sheet * And look up at the spire, see, it inspire. * * Cause the spire is higher than the jet in the sky. * I guess we were swag. Wheel it up, wheel it, wheel it, wheel it, wheel it. Come, come, come. [giggling] Ready to do your party piece? Okay. Mr. Harvey's tour of the cathedral is about to begin. Can we all gather around please? Where's the Burger King, sir? [students laughing] Quiet everyone! Come on. You might learn something. Um. Salisbury is... Salisbury is seen as the most perfect cathedral in England. The purest example of the English decorative style. It's also famous for having the tallest Spire in the country. That's 404 feet. Yes, it's exactly 404 feet. Has your God given you permission to be in it? What gives the building it's distinctive style, it's purity, is the relative speed of its construction. And the fact that it was built over one period. Most of our cathedrals are built over hundreds of years. Salisbury was built in under 40. That's not that quick. Given the technology then, it's incredibly quick. Well, the dome was quicker. I doubt the dome will be standing in 800 years time. People wouldn't have the skill to build something like this nowadays. Wouldn't have the motivation, the inclination. It takes faith to build something like this to give your life to something you may never see finished. * Look up in the sky, look way up high * * God is in the house, aye, aye, aye * Keep it down guys. As we move up the knave and reach the two transits, you'll see the cathedral is crucifix shaped. The building was built to represent the cross of Christ. In fact, so without the cross, there'd be no cathedral. As some of you will know from your reading, the Spire was added later. The huge weight caused the pillars of main walls to bow out and drastic reinforcing girdles and strainer arches were added. Sir, you can see better from the outside. Sir. Why did they make the cathedral so big? Couldn't they have spent the money on the poor? It's a fair question. It's a question well worth asking. What is all this for? Well, one of the reasons they were built on such a scale was to inspire people, to make them look up with awe and wonder. In those days, people believed that a glimpse of a cathedral would make the most sceptical man believe in a God. Now of course, they make very nice subjects for coffee table books and table mats. These trophies were known as scaffolding. They decorated stages for coffins or effigies of distinction. What is this, sir? I don't know. Not sure I care. Where's he going? He's gone off. [tense music] This is the lady chapel. It was built- [sad violin music] It was- It's not- Should we move on from here. You want to go to prison or something? What do you want? This is a sacred building. Not to you. Nor to you. Exactly. You think we're all the same, don't you? I'm one of those people on the news shouting death to America? No. Then why are you always giving me a hard time? I don't like you. You don't know me. You think you're better than the rest of us. So you got no sense of humour. You should see yourself with your serious face. At least I believe in something. Getting down on your knees 10 times a day like a robot? Five. Well, if that's what you got to do to believe, then you can keep me out. Anyway, you only believe cause it's your culture. It's what you're told to do. At least I've made my own mind up. You got a grip like a ninja. They teach you that in the Taliban did they? Someone's coming! [children chattering] Come on you lot! Christopher and Freddy. When we enter the choir, I want you both to peel off and remain in the middle of the little gaps. Then when I'm Dimitis, you come back and join the rest of us. [students chattering] Some of you might recognise this spot. In the photograph some of you must've seen. This is where I stood with my wife. Pamela. It was just here. I'd just asked her to marry me. Someone, I remember an American gentlemen, took a picture of us. And when we got married, we went to every cathedral in England on our honeymoon, 27 cathedrals in two weeks in a forecourt dealer. [students giggling] Yes, I was a happy man that day, that's right. Now for a while, I really was Mr. Happy. It's hard for some of you to believe, I know, but it's true. I was happy. And then she killed herself. And that took the smile off my face. So you could say that honeymoon ended at that point. You look surprised. That's how I looked when I found her, surprised. Lying on our sitting room floor, her face a kind of blue-white like those plates you used to get. Oh yes, it's quite a thing to find your wife and she's killed herself. It's not something teacher's training prepares you for. No, no, carry on. You must get the facts. I think you'll find that the arches were made in 1241 and the picture was taken in 1983. But that won't be on the sheet. Maybe that's the salient fact here. You don't really need to know when this building was built. I mean, after all, what does it matter that a spire is 404 feet high. It has absolutely no relevance to your life whatsoever. How did one of you put it? In the end, it's just a pile of old stone. I mean it's beautiful stone, but it's just a pile of old stone. It doesn't make God any more real. It doesn't stop people killing themselves. It doesn't take the memory away. Anyway, I'm running off subject, I apologise for that. It's most discomforting for you, I'm sure. I apologise too for taking it out on you. And one of you in particular. I'm sorry for that. Anyway, here ends the tour. Well, thanks very much, Mr. Harvey, for an interesting and informative talk. Thank you, sir. Thank you Mr. Harvey. Thank you. Thank you sir. Thanks. Can I go to the shop? Of course you can dear. For a moment I thought I was going to have to stop you there. You wanted the facts. Have you seen Helen? She wandered off when the tour got personal. All right. I'll find her. [Priest] Lord, we lift up our praise to you for the honour and glory of your name in the name of the father, the son and the holy spirit. Amen. [Children] Amen. They've locked us in. I'm afraid you're not allowed through here, sir. One of our pupils is through there. It's sealed off, sir, for the restoration. I know. Sir! [choral music] [mysterious music] What you staring at? Don't look at me like that! Where the hell is everyone? [hip hop music] * Go, go, go, go, go shawty * * It's your birthday * * We gon' party like it's your birthday * * Sip Bacardi like it's your birthday * [giggling] * And you know we don't give a it's not your birthday * * You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub * * Mama I got what you need if you need to feel above * * I'm into havin' sex, I ain't into makin' love * [giggling] Wilson. [giggling] What I wanna know is, how did they get them stones up there? -All the way up there? -[giggling] How did they keep going for all that time? 40 years, sir. Mental. Where the hell have you been? Appreciating the view. [giggling] Look, it's high. [giggling] It's really, really high. [giggling] Have you seen the others? Mo? [giggling] Elliot? Helen, what about Helen? She's not my problem, sir. [giggling] We've still got five missing. I'm sure they'll be fine. This is turning out to be an interesting day. We've all learned something. A little more than we needed, I think, I can't believe he subjected them to that. He probably taught them more in those five minutes than he's taught in 20 years. [giggling] [sniffling] Helen? [church bell tolls] [crying] Helen? [sobbing] I'm sorry. I should never have said what I said, or grabbed you like that. Well you did! Here. It was anger. Not with you. I wasn't angry with you. Well, that's not what it looked like. It just came out badly. I was upset. What do you expect me to do? Feel sorry for you? No, no. Why did she do it? Your wife? You didn't say why. I'm not sure. Not for love. What do you mean? I've always made out she did it for noble reasons, that she did it because she was too good for this life. That's not really true. Actually, that's a lie. The fact is, she chose death over life. She chose despair instead of me. What was she like? She was clever. And pretty, like you. She wasn't well. She was seriously depressed. And she thought there was nothing in this world that could change how she felt. Sometimes that's how I feel. Sometimes I think I'd rather die. You think that would solve everything? What about your family, your friends, the people who love you? They wouldn't care. Oh, I think they would. That's where you're wrong. And all that stuff I said about needing courage to kill yourself is crap. You need a lot more courage to live. Why do you spray? I don't spray, no I bomb. I'm a bomber. One of the silver angels. There's three of us, Easy, Danskin and me. But why? I want to leave my mark. See when I'm bombing, like a station or a hall of fame somewhere, I'm tagging myself mental. I get this feeling that someone's watching me. Not like in a bad way, like the pigs or something. Nah, someone looking down, appreciating me. Then it's like there's an audience, but an audience of one. That's God. Do you want to bomb the cathedral? You think your God would strike you down? Have you got that book? No, I just want to look at something. [choral music] It's a famous piece of music. It's about a time when God would put an end to suffering and pain and justice will be done. Do you believe in all that? I'm too angry to believe it. Angry with who? With Him. I'd like to believe in God and all that. I feel too dirty. We're all too dirty. That's where we find God. In the dirt. In the blood and the dirt. [choral music] [sniffling] I did it. The photo. It's a defaced memory anyway. I feel weird. Here. All right. [sniffling] Thanks. No. Thank you. Come on. [hip hop music] * How you doing? * * You good? * * I know you like that * * I know you like that * * See the girls in the club they getting wild fa me * * And all the pretty chicks all wanna smile at me * * They raps cats they all got they style from me * * And if I ever see them man, they probably bow to me * * And when this beat drop I know they gon lean * * What they do, I know they gon fen * Helen! Are you all right? Fine. We're both fine. Malcolm. We're going to have to talk about this later. Not now, when we get back. Yes. It's not quite been the day we hoped for. Listen. Listen to what? That. You asked me why we're here. That's why we're here. You've lost me. Something you can't offset. Something you can't teach. A religious experience. [mysterious music] [sniffs] Had a nice day? I feel like a sheep dog. Got a few strays. Let's go back, they're probably down the shops. Not a patch on Mont-Saint-Michel. * Mr. Cole in a hole * * Mr. Cole in a hole * * Bless my soul * * Mr. Cole in a hole * Very good, now get on. Had a nice day? [gentle piano music]
