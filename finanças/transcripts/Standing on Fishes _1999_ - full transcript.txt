â™ª [phone ringing] Hello? Oh hi, Mom. Mom, what's wrong? Mom. Mom, I can't hear you. Put the phone closer. What happened? What do you? When? Why are you? When's the funeral? [door knobs shakes, knocking at door] WOMAN: Hello! Hello! Caleb. Uh-huh. [knocking continues] Well, I don't know if I'm going to be able to make the Mass. Well, because I got to finish this thing. No, it's a entirely different thing. Are you OK? Did you call Lauren? [glass breaks] Mom, listen, I'm really sorry but-- Mom, I'm very sorry, but I-- I'm going to have to call you back. Erica is here. Why won't you open this door? Mom, seriously, I--I'm going to have to call you back. I love you too. Bye-bye. Ah fuck! Fuck! Fuck! Are you OK, sweetie? No. No. No, I'm not fucking OK. Use your innate sense of observation. -You're an artist. -It didn't go well? No. No. No, it didn't go well for fuck's sake. What do you think? Look at me. I'm sorry. You want to talk about it? Oh. Get up! Get up! Sit down. OK. Now, I'm you. That makes you, me. I've been sitting all night in the nice candlelight listening to geriatric favorites or whatever working on whatever that is. You have just had the worst, most humiliating audition of your life. The sheer soul killing terror of which is only compounded by the nightmare known as the 405 freeway. You drive all the way out to the valley in, like, sluggish rush hour hell, could've gone to your own house, right? Which is only a few minutes from the audition, but no. Listen. I'm sorry. You want me to get you something? But it's Wednesday. Yeah. And that's one of the nights that you've agreed to spend at your boyfriend's house. Your boyfriend who says he loves you and supports you regardless of your intensity which he says just makes you all the sexier. And then when you finally get there, he locks you out. -I was talking to my mother. -Who hates me! All right. All right. That's game. That's game. I'm putting you in the bath. You need the treatment. Oh God. Is that the full treatment or just a bath? Disrobe and find out. [sighs] [groans] How was your day, sweetie? Uh, I was perfect for that part. I am Rocket Girl. Don't laugh. Perfect for that thing. You saw what I wore? None of the other people at that audition went in there putting any effort into it whatsoever. I walk in looking like a complete asshole. You're enthusiastic. That's a gift. I can't do this anymore. Oh, little hot house flower. How was your day? My grandma died. I guess she couldn't find her nitro pills. You know how cluttered her house is with all those tea cups and spoons. She couldn't remember how to dial 911. So... You OK? Yeah. It's weird. I wasn't that close to her. Just when I was little she used to give me baths in this sink. Do you have to go to the funeral? Well, I want to go. Oh no, I know. Just when is that happening? I don't know. I got to call my mom back. I'm really sorry, Caleb. Let me get you a towel. Have you finished the thing yet? [Caleb chuckles] I got a lot of work done on it tonight. And I found some very lucid gynecological resource books that helped. I just have some smoothing and some texturing to do. Oh, that is gross. It's just sculpting like anything else. No, it isn't. It's tainted. Hiring someone to actually construct a prosthetic vagina? I mean, that borders on the pathological or extreme indulgence. Well, what are they supposed to do? I mean, they hired this woman with the explicit understanding she might have to show some muff. Oh. Oh, my God. That is so demeaning. What do you want me to call it? Oh, I don't know let's see, twat, fur biscuit, soft shell taco? Her private region. Really muff, that is so unlike you. You sound like a beer soaked frat boy idiot. She agreed to do the nudity. OK, that's not nudity, Caleb. That is male-repressed aggressive bullshit preying on the sexual insecurities of some actress, like it's some tremendous catharsis to spread your legs for a camera. It's a job. There are other kinds of acting jobs, Caleb. No, for me it's a job. -It's demeaning for both of you. -You haven't even seen it. Well, yeah. I know what one looks like. No, but I've made this from nothing. Honey, I think one would be equally correct in stating you copied it from nature. What? Why? Don't get insulted. Why not get insulted when you insult me? I didn't mean anything. You totally belittled what I do. You are capable of much more interesting work than this. That's not the point. This is what I'm doing right now. This is what's been taking weeks of work and research, of a building up and tearing down, trying to reveal some subtlety. This is my work right now. OK, but you're missing the whole point. The very nature of this project is beyond any kind of subtlety. It is a woman's vagina for Christ's sake. That is blatant non-imaginative exploitation. But my contribution is different. No, Caleb. You're different. You're an artist but your contribution in this instance is to facilitate this whole degenerative process. That is really unfair. You haven't even seen it. Put it up here. -Can I touch it? -No, the clay's still soft. Haven't made a mold of it yet. OK. Interesting. You hate it. It's that all the hair it's going to have? I don't know. It's not my department. Because right now, all bald like that it looks like a little girl's which is sick enough but on a grown woman, oh really. Man! Hollywood never ceases to amaze me. Caleb. Caleb, I think you're brilliant. I might not think that everything you do is. You know what? That sounds just like something my mother would say. -Wow. -Yeah. Get into bed. OK. Come on. I love you, sweetie. I love what you do. It's OK. Forget it. Come here. Come here. [sighs] Oh God, I had such a shitty day. I look forward to this clinch all day long. I missed you. I missed how you smell and how you hold me. I want your hands on me. Just put your hands on me. Oh God. I just need to breathe. OK wait. Wait honey, honey, honey. Slow. Just go slower, OK? OK let me feel your hands and I'll.... Kiss me. [grunts] OK. Oh, God damn it. Ugh. You're going too fast OK? I can't come like that. Not after the day that I had. And you know the day I had, Jesus. I'm sorry. I just need some tenderness, some slow thick hands. I know. I know. OK. Slowly. Here. You know, like you enjoy it. What the fuck does that mean? Oh, Christ, don't make that mean anything. What--what does that mean? You don't think I enjoy it? No. I just, I think that you're only thinking about you getting off. You know, I mean you're wrestling around on top of me like I'm not even here. Well, what do you want me to do? Ugh. I had a hard day, Caleb. I need to come hard. I need the release. Let me go down on you. No. Oh no! Not like that. That is not spontaneous. It's not loving. You have to want to. I...I want to. OK. Slow. Ow, ow, ow. Shit. God, did you shave? It's like you're rubbing me with sandpaper. Bullshit, Erica. Why? What? Why are you so angry? This is bullshit, Erica. I can't have sex like this. This isn't even sex. This is like Nazi aerobics. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. You're making this mean something. This does mean something. I'm telling you my needs. What I need. Is that so awful? No, your needs are fine. But this is two-party masturbation. Sex is supposed to happen between two people. Like a team, you know, I do a little something, you do a little something, like a dance. I had the fucked day and all I wanted was just a little tenderness and some slow hands. All you can do is lock me out of your house and then yell at me. This is--this is so fucked. So now you're leaving? We're having a confrontation about our needs, and you're leaving. We're not having a confrontation. We're having an argument. This is an argument, Erica, and I'm sick of this bullshit! I got an early morning with Jason. We got to go over the RTV we're going to use. I got to get final approval on the piece. I got all these things I got to do and all you can think about is your day. What happened in your day? Well, Caleb, if you have some unresolved issues about your day, we can discuss them. You don't have to get all dramatic. Everything is unresolved! Look at me for Christ's sake. I got a mortgage due on this place every month I can barely afford. I got a guest house I have to rent that is so fucking small people are afraid to even look inside of it. You come over like some guilt-slinging tornado screaming "me, me, me!" You know my grandmother who used to give me baths in this sink, she died today and I make fake fucking twats for a living! What? No, that is not funny. -[Erica laughs] -That is tragically unfunny. I'm serious. I'm in hell, and you only made it worse. I'm sorry, sweetie. Come here. No. You're selfish. I am. We all are. I'm sorry. Now come here. You really suck. I do. I'm horrible, unapproachable. Now get into bed. Put your head down on me. Right. I'm wicked and hateful and indulgent. Now go to sleep. Fuck. Some kind of music was playing, faintly. Some gothic folk something just sort of warming the background. Candles were everywhere like some kind of artificial daylight and we were completely entwined, meshed like... mmm, like one skin. And she tilted her head back and she had this amazing throat, long like a Modigliani and these sounds start to escape from her and it takes me a moment. It took me a moment, but I realized she was saying something. So I moved into her and she was calling the angels. She was summoning the thousands of tiny unborn souls that were circling us at that moment, whispering to be incarnated. And I realized this woman understands. This woman knows that the child has to be set free. She holds the key to our heart's existence. And we're moving like one animal now. Strong and vascular like deep chords of music. And I just...lost it. You came inside her? Tell me you didn't come inside her. Not really. Not really. You pulled out? At the last minute I had a flash of clarity and I thought, "What the fuck am I doing?" So I edged out a bit. You edged out? What does that mean? I got out as soon as I realized what I was doing. You edged out? Did you pull out? Did you pull it out in time? I think I did, yes. Why don't you just wear a condom? We've had this conversation. What if you got this woman pregnant? I'd raise the child. It would be mine. I don't have a problem with that. -How long have you known her? -What difference does that make? -How long? -Tuesday. -Last Tuesday? -This Tuesday. Two days? That's two days, and you're not wearing a condom. What difference does it make? There was a connection. That only takes a second. Besides, I want to be a father. You are insane. How are you going to be a father when you're dead? No one is dying. They have a cocktail now. I find out I have AIDS. I get a few shots. It's not even remotely that simple. How long have you known Erica? Almost two years. Do you ever talk about children? I know you want to have children. It takes a long time to get to know someone. You had another fight didn't you? No. Yes. No. I don't know. I don't even know if it's fighting anymore. It's just become the way we relate. Well, that can't be good. No. I finished the mold. So you think you two will stay together? Did you spray that with clear coat? -Shit, I forgot. -Get me some thinner, 2%. Yeah. Oh, man! I'm really sorry. I wasn't thinking. That's all right. I'm just a little rushed. Verk wants to see a cast of this thing by lunch tomorrow. -That soon? -Well, yeah it's a business. This is an $8,000 rubber cooch for Christ's sake. -You look tired, Caleb. -I am. Spray the fucker. â™ª [phone ringing] [machine clicks] CALEB: Hi, this is Caleb. You've reached Morpheus Special Effects. I'm not here right now, so leave a message. [beep] WOMAN [on machine]: Hello, Caleb. This is Camille. Yeah. I read about your guest house in the paper. I'm very intrigued. Caleb, that's a beautiful name. It's from the Bible, isn't it? Caleb. I'd love to know more about you, Caleb, when you get a chance. -[beep] -I'm a sculptor. Well, an effects technician, really. Hello? Hello? You want to see the guest house? Wait. You want to rent it? Look, I should tell you. It's--it's very-- No, trust me, please, it's very small. It's in the valley. Yeah. I, uh, I could give you the address. Mm-hmm. Could I just ask you what it is you do? No, for a living. You--you're a sculptor? Sorry? A sculptress. [click] MAN: And she said she'd take it just like that? That's what she said. Did you tell her how small it is? Never got the chance. What is she going to do, live there by herself? She's a sculptor. She sells her pieces out of her dad's gallery near Davis. She just needs room for herself and the clay. [sighs] Man, you are so lucky. What do you mean? Don't you realize who this is? -Jason. -Caleb. This is your angel, man. This is the one. No questions. Total commitment to the space. A sculptor. What more do you want? -What's her name? -I don't even want to tell you. Why not? Promise me you won't make it mean anything. Camille. Oh, my God! Fuck. I got to go. What time is it? It's 20 to 12:00. I got to go. I got to meet Richard Verk in half an hour. How did the thing turn out? Well, we'll see. Caleb... this is a magnificent time to be alive. Caleb, Janice. We spoke on the phone. Please, sit down. This is Richard Verk. Do you need an iced tea? Do I need one? Another iced tea, por favor. That's so rude. What's rude? I assume he speak Spanish. -You should never assume. -Children, children. Let's not squabble over such non-issues. There, you see the beverages arrived? Now, everybody may refresh themselves. [police siren passes by] Well, let's get down to business. Have you brought it with you? -I'm sorry, what? -The thing, the prize, the great compromise that's kept me up all hours, nearly ruining my artistic vision. Do you have it? Oh, the thing. Yes, yes, I have it. I have it right here. Well, may I see it? Here? I have to avenge with it. Now? Right--right now? Is there a problem, Caleb? Did they bring this sweetener for your tea? Oh, I don't-- I don't need anything. No, there's no problem. I just thought Mr. Verk would-- Please. Call him Richard. Call me Richard. Richard, would like to see it in a more-- or rather less--public arena. Arena? You used the word arena. That's very interesting. An arena, as in a circus. That's apropos really. This is like a circus. A laughless circus. If this is indeed an arena, this place a stage for spectacle and daring. Show us your act, Caleb. Join us. Will you join our circus, Caleb? Oh, my God. Yes. Let me look at it. Oh, that is disgusting. Oh no it's not. Quite the contrary. It's a compliment really. He rendered it so lifelike. I just assumed it must emit some odor, however faint. Do you want have a look at it, Henry? No thank you, Richard. I don't have much experience with those. Hmm. Really it's lovely. -It's so light. -It's high-density silicone. It's a little warm to wear but strong. That's something, isn't it? I guess. Good Lord. It really is lovely. It's remarkable. Maybe I should do a "comedia del'arte" piece. I could have all the actors wear this sex on their faces. HENRY: It's time to be getting back-- I've got a meeting with Anna. RICHARD: You know I really am impressed. A little too impressed, actually. It's lovely, but it's another movie entirely. Seeing it now, I realized that I really need something a bit more O'Keefe. Georgia O'Keefe? Exactly. You're so bright. You've seen them, those lovely, strong water colors. Orchids and lilies, like great breathing vaginas. Uh, yeah. Yeah, that's more what we need. This is a bit too... on the nose. Are you with me? Uh...well, actually, heh. I was under the impression that this piece was going to work in about 1/8 of a second of film, just when she uncrosses her legs. How did you know that? It was in the job order. I read the script. -Where did you get a script? -You read the script? I want the option, Caleb, to discover, if necessary. OK. I'm sorry. -No, no, it's all right. -It can be fixed. It's going to have to be fitted. Yes, yes. Have you met Anna McCaphrey? -No. -You have Friday free? Friday it is. I'm sorry I don't think I can make Friday. Is there some sort of problem? I have a... well, I have a thing on Friday. What sort of thing? Can't we do it any other day? No. This is important, Caleb. This is the show. What do you have? If you don't mind my query. Oh, well... my--my grandmother just died. She died a few days ago, and well, the funeral is this Friday. You were very close? -Not really. -Then it's settled. I'll talk to Anna's assistant. She'll get in touch with you. But I told my mother-- Caleb, it's really very simple. This business is about sacrifice. Let me tell you a little story. My mother missed my high school graduation because she had to be backstage for opening night for one of her clients. Now, at the time, I was heartbroken. But that actress went on to win the Tony Award for the best performance. I always felt a little responsible for that. When I got married she had a similar conflict. But that actor won the People's Choice Award and a Golden Globe. Two weeks later, I got a gift basket with some bath salts, and a typed note that says, "Sure you'll be happy. Hope it lasts. Mom." But four years ago when she died, I was on the set of Richard Verk's breakthrough film, The Right to Remain Silent. I couldn't make the funeral but that film did over a $130 domestic and three times that foreign. Sacrifice is what has made all of these tremendous things possible. Now trust me. I know it's harsh. But this is your moment to shine. It may not come again, either you want it or you don't. Do you have my number? Of course. Caleb. This could lead to other things. Sure. Hi. I didn't hear you. Well, that's because you were listening to the clay. I thought you might be hungry. Christ, that's quite a feast. Yes, well, and I delivered it myself. I assume if you're following the usual pattern you haven't eaten yet. You assumed correct, my lady. Well, so stop your trifling over there. Come join me in this most exquisite repast. Where do you want to eat? Well, over here on the table of course. Where you create, we shall nourish ourselves. What's this for? Same thing. Oh, are they doing Little Shop of Horrorsnow? I had a meeting with Verk. He said he wanted some changes. -I guess he wanted the option. -Option to what? Break into songs about fertilizer? Actually, it had something to do with artistic vision, whatever that means. Hey, didn't you have a callback today? Now why would you want to go ruin this lovely old evening with talk like that? Was it that bad? Picture this. I walk into a room with every faux-chested, collagen-lipped actress in Hollywood. Some of them even have these little futuristic outfits on, so I'm feeling really lame in this dress. I sit down, start going over the sides. The casting assistant, she squeaks out of her little office and she hands me another set of slides. Well, now I'm feeling pretty good, right? No outfit, but I put an extra set of slides which is more than these silicone losers have. Then I looked down and I see it. "Engine technician one." OK, scroll to cross the page. Well, time folded right then and there and I saw myself, 40 years old with bad caps doing dinner theater in Michigan. I thought this is it, I'm out. This is not what six years living in New York fighting winters and roaches and assholes with too much hair gel was all about. You have two years with the best acting teacher in the country, Caleb. Working for tips on Christmas eve, auditioning for any part that like might have a line, wear that fucking chicken costume in front of Madison Square Garden. Oh, my God. Why am I going there? Anyway, I had an epiphany. I'm quitting. Yeah I'm going to be doing photography full-time. I already lined up a couple of suckers for headshots. So, that's it. I'm happy. Wow. That's a lot of change for one day. Yeah, well, not really. I mean, it's been coming in a long time. I'm just--I'm sick of doing what doesn't make me happy in the hope that someday it might. That's amazing. And I'm really proud of you. -To the unknown. -To the unknown. I missed you. I really missed you. I'm sorry. I'm sorry for all my shit. You know, it's like I get so scared. I get so scared. I get so wrapped up. And I could get-- I know, it's OK. I want you to know how much I treasure you, Caleb. I'd get you. God, I'm so glad you were born. [metal clanging] What are you doing? What are you doing? Well, I'm trying to-- this table is very uneven. OK. Well, hold on, hold on, hold on. Let me rotate down a little. -Ouch -Aw. -Shit. -What? My knees are, like, digging into this table. OK. All right, hey, turn over. No, this is fine. Oh, it's not fine. Look at your face. You look like you're doing your income tax. -Well, I'm in pain. -OK, then stop. But you wanted to. Don't make this about me, OK. You were right there with me. Oh, let's forget it. Oh, my God. Did you lose your erection? Jesus! Well, did you? It's not like anybody's here to hear us. Well, obviously for not fucking, I've lost my erection. -All right, God, calm down. -Let's just forget it. It's all right. God, it's all right. I can masturbate. No. Why not? I'm horny. What are you like some kind of spy missile? You get a program in and you have to carry it out no matter what? Hey that's just mean, all right? I didn't throw you losing your erection in your face. -Yes, you did. -Well, I just mentioned it. Can't you just not do that right now? Can't we just be together? I don't see what the big deal is. I feel like an ornament or something. I mean you go off and please yourself while I'm over here staring at the fucking ceiling. OK. OK. OK, honey. Come here. You can do it for me. I'm sorry, I'm just-- I'm just not in the mood. So that means I shouldn't be either? No. That means that out of consideration for me, for what I'm feeling, you'll just not do that. I'm sorry. I really, I thought our relationship was like a whole different kind of relationship. -Well, what does that mean? -Well, I just thought that we could be ourselves around one another, you know, and not hide behind any bullshit premises. Hey, I don't think what I'm feeling is bullshit, Erica. I'm asking you not to masturbate in front of me. Is that so difficult to understand? OK and I am asking you for the freedom and support that I thought this relationship was built on. Look, if you want to play with yourself so bad, then play with yourself! Oh, my God. Why does this always happen? Why? It's like we disagree. And instead of it just being what it is it becomes this whole thing, -you know, full of meaning. -These are my feelings, Erica. Yes, they're your feelings, Caleb. Well, I have feelings too. God, why are your feelings more important than mine? That's not what I'm saying, all right? Making love takes two people. Two people have to be involved. Who says? It's just sex, OK? I mean that's it. People can make it mean whatever they want. They can fuck. They can make love. One person can masturbate the other can watch. Whatever, you know. I mean, it all comes down to what you make it mean. I don't know. I don't believe that. I think it does mean something when another person is present, it means something. Oh? That's very interesting coming from a guy who carts a rubber vagina around town for a living. -Fuck you. -Why? That has nothing to do with anything. Why not? I mean the act is so sacred to you I thought the parts that went along with it would be too. I don't even know what we're talking about anymore. OK. You know what then? Come here. Let's not talk about it. -Are you mad? -Uh-uh. I just think we have some issues. Well, if it's me, I'm sorry. If it's you? Is that, I'm sorry, is that you trying to take responsibility or something? God, I'm so sick of this shit. Look, I'm sorry I just have a lot on my mind. I got an early meeting with Anna McCaphrey in the morning. You're meeting Anna McCaphrey? Well, yeah, I got to fit her with the prosthesis. Why do you have to meet her? Well, I guess I could reach my measuring tape around her body and never introduce myself but it's not the best way to have a client relationship. Oh so now she's a client? Well, yeah she's wearing the thing. I am sorry. I thought you're in a meeting with Verk. I thought you were working with Verk. Hey, don't make this mean anything, Erica. Are you going to her house? I don't know, whatever is convenient for her, I guess. Do you want to go to her house? I don't care. I just want to do the job, get it over with, get paid. Aren't you curious? -About what? -How she must live a rich, gorgeous, terrible actress like her. Whew! She must have a horror show for a house. I don't think she's a bad actress. Oh puhlease, did you see her in The Right to Remain Silent? Did you for one second, buy her as a cop with all the hair? "Hey freeze, assholes. You have the right to remain silent." The way she would like leave her gun here, I mean she's like a mud-wrestling fantasy. She had some moments in that other thing she did. Oh yeah right, the waitress thing. Come please! The woman's not waited a table in her life. -You don't know that. -She's limited at best. You're not the same type so you shouldn't worry about it. What the fuck is that supposed to mean? You're nothing like each other, that's all. Why? Because I won't flash my twat and flip my hair a thousand times for a camera crew? Look, what difference does it make? You quit. That's right. I quit. I'm entitled to my opinion. [vehicle approaches] -[thunder] -Shit. Hello. Sorry. I waited. Right. Oh you're-- you're Camille, right? Yeah. OK. You want to come inside? You really don't have to show me the place. I know what I want it. I have all my stuff. Yeah, you brought everything? Yeah. You're serious? You haven't even seen it. I have money. Well, that's good but I'd like to know something about you. I knew everything about you from your voice. Oh. Where did you live last? At home. Did you make these sculptures? Yeah. Did you pay rent there? They're just how I imagined them. You work from your dreams too. Yes, sometimes. All the time. Have--have you lived any place else? No. No other place seemed right. Do you want to help me unpack my things? I don't have much. I don't know. I got to think about this. -Why? -Well, you know, we just-- Does somebody else want to live there? Oh no, no. I can't even get people to look inside of it. I have money. It's, um... first and last and security. Right. Well...show you the place. It's perfect. It's just how I imagined it. Oh, glad you like it. -One room. -Sorry? One room. It's like the center of a body. It's like a perfect seashell. Great bloodless heart. [exhales] Sit down. OK. Do you remember when you were little? You could look on something for hours and hours and see all different shapes inside the one thing. Yeah. You could look at a candle flame or a rose bud and see world after world inside it. And the deeper you looked the less you felt like yourself. You felt like the flame or the flower. It's so simple. What's it like now? It's different. It's harder. Listen, I'm going to go. But if you need anything I'm just in that front house, OK? OK. OK. [door creaks closes] I need something. You do? I need you to keep talking to me. -Keep telling me things. -We don't even know each other. Not yet, but it's becoming clear. How did you know that I work from my dreams? Same way anyone would, by looking at your work. A lot of people have seen my work. Heh. Yeah. But how many have actually looked at it? I don't know. Maybe you're the first. When a sculpture of mine wants to be born, I get a visit from the moth fairy. Moth fairy? She only comes to me late at night and only on certain nights. When my heart is in love with my mind and my mind becomes full. Then she lights on my pillow and she tells me in her little winged voice what it's to be. The hardest part is remembering. Remembering the feeling when you first find out what you're about to make. Once you have that, the rest just follows. [thunder] It's all there really is. I think we were born with everything and then the world starts to fill us up, and we forget. You actually make your living selling your artwork. You're funny. Heh. That makes it more real to you, doesn't it? If people would part with their money to possess what they already have but have forgotten they have, yeah, people buy it. I'm on a two-year backorder. Really? Yeah. You can work magic, Caleb. That hasn't been my experience. First you have to believe it. [thunder] What are you smiling about? You're fucking radiant. -Oh, my God. -What? What happened? You'll never believe what I did last night. Do I know her? Oh, my God! This is so not like me. -Bullshit, what happened? -Camille. And she moves in just like that. Really? She starts talking to me, right, talking to me like she knows me and understands me. She sells her sculptures. She has this moth fairy thing. She makes magic happen... And you fucked her, right? No, but we kiss, and it was incredible. I didn't know what I was doing or why. We just meshed together. This sounds more like you. Have you told Erica yet? Fuck, no. I have to do that. Why? Because we have a relationship based on trust. Caleb, you spent last night dry humping the moth fairly lady, I think any trust you might have had is broken. Fuck, fuck you're right. I'll tell her later. What time is it? It's almost 10:00. Where are you rushing off to now? I got a call from Anna McCaphrey's assistant this morning. She says I got to be at her house by 2:30. -Is this normal? -I don't know. You want to go? Fuck no. This is why you're the boss. -I could make you. -You're right. You could. But you're not that kind of boss. Just go. You'll walk in there, she'll be completely charmed by you. Either of that, or you'll piss her off, and you'll never work in this town again. What difference does it make? It will be an interesting experience. â™ª Hello. [birds chirping] Hello. Perfect. â™ª Hey, you can't park the car here, pal. I'm only going to be a second. Sorry, you can't park the car here. Please, I just have this little thing I have to do, and then I'll be out of here. I just need to find Anna McCaphrey. I wish I could help you. You can't park the car here. -I'll pay you. -Oh, great. I will pay you $20 if you let me park my car here for five minutes. Shit, OK $5, but it's still a dollar a minute. Look, pal, I wish I could help you out, but I could really lose my job. You can't park your car here. -Janice, Janice. -Where the hell have you been? Two hours late. I was told to meet at Anna McCaphrey's house. You cannot park your car here. Give me your keys. -What? -Keys. Park it in the crew lot. Bitch. This is really unprofessional behavior, Caleb. Verk is having a fucking coronary. I was told to meet at her house. Did you check your service? -Yes. -Recently? I don't know. I checked before I left my house. You got to be more on top of things, Caleb. Things change at light speed in this business. -You should know that. -I'm sorry. Richard is going to go ballistic. He's probably going to make me listen to that damn story about his cockney childhood again. You know, he had me so tense at our live show, I stopped having my period. What am I saying? Why am I telling you this? I don't know. It's OK. My mother had a similar problem. Your mother? Really? Now I'm like your mother? Oh, terrific. -No, I didn't mean it like-- -I know. I know. I know. Look, I'm not usually like this. I'm a very compassionate person. I want you to know that no matter what happens, I think that you're more likely than not a very pleasant young man. I'm not really sure what it is that you do or how you do it. But I'm sure that you're very good at whatever it is that you do and you'll be however good you can be. OK? OK, showtime. Come on, come on. I see the messenger is finally here. I'm really sorry. Don't grovel. Did you at least bring it with you? Oh! That is fabulous. My goodness, well done. All right then, my boy. Bring her in! VERK: Bring her in. Vera. Vera! Put Vera back on, you little bastard. Vera sweetie, what did we talk about the last time I came in for a facial? No, I will remind you. Organic cucumbers. Yes, it's important, because the store-bought ones are yucky and burn me. Well, I am telling you they've burned me. You put those little pieces of store-bought cucumbers in my eyes again, I will have immigration on your ass so fast you won't have time for a fucking Belini! Damn it. What the fuck is going on? I still have 1/2 an hour in make up. All right, just shut up. Don't be a tart. I have a surprise for you. I've spent many a sleepless night pondering your adamant refusal to do the pussy shot. Frankly, I believe that every young starlet should have at least one tastefully lit pussy shot. But that's just me. Richie. Richie, we have talked about this. Either get me a body double, or make a piece. I guess I have taken your suggestions too heart. We may now dispel the rumor that I don't listen to my actors. By way of reconciliation and in the dire hope of getting this film back on schedule and near budget, I offer you this, a compromise. Oh, my God. Oh, my God. Richie. Strap it on. Strap it on. Strap it on. Look at me, look at me, look at me, look at me. Whoa. Am I sexy? You look like a rhododendron. Either that or you have the worst yeast infection in history. Oh God, Richie, you're fucking nuts. Yes, I always will be. -I love you. -By the way, that is the most expensive flower I've ever bought a woman. Muah! -ANNA: Look at me! Look at me! -Back to work. ANNA: Freeze, asshole, you have the right to remain silent. MAN: All right everybody back to number one. This is for you. They never were going to use it, were they? You've been good sport. You know, you have no idea how hard I worked on that. Oh, yes, I do. [door closes] [thunder] Jesus! Sorry, I didn't mean to scare you. It's all right. What are you doing? Do you think I can get an advance on next week's salary? Sure, what for? I just had some expenses this month I didn't anticipate. How much do you think you'll need? However much you can spare. How much? I don't know. 300? Sure. You need it right now? What's wrong? It's nothing. I just--I got this-- this thing I got to do. What thing? You want to tell me about it? Will you just listen to me, no lectures or anything? What did you do? Will you just be my friend and listen to me? Yeah. [sighs] That girl I was telling you about... she's late. She's late, and she's just going ahead like I don't even fucking exist. She calls me last week, says she has some news. And I knew--I knew what it was. So we meet at this Thai place near at her house. She says she's late. So we finish our seafood soup. And we go to the mini mart. We buy a pregnancy test and some gum, I think, and we go to her place. Now her roommate's in the shower, so we have to wait to get into the bathroom. So she sits down, and she pees on the stick, and her roommates blasting some speed metal or some shit. And I see this little blue cross appear. And something just goes off, inside me. And I hand her the stick. And she starts crying, but all I can think about is this-- is this--this life-- this life that's begun, this little life that's with us in a Los Angeles bathroom with the music blasting and the mother crying, and the father wishing. And I realize it's doomed. I look at her, and I don't see a mother. I see a girl. And I look inside myself, and I know I'm not ready either. And I don't know what to do, because I... I want that little weight on my shoulders, you know, and I want those--those little eyes that close with a kiss goodnight. And I want that little person, you know, and I can't have it. And that makes the wanting worse. [sighs] You want me to drive you down there or anything? No, no, I just... I just wanted you to listen. And you did that...very well. [phone ringing inside] [on machine] Hi, this is Caleb. I'm not home right now. But if you leave a message, I'll call you back. Thanks. Bye. [beep] WOMAN: Caleb? Honey, are you there? Well, I guess you're probably still at work. I just wanted you to know that the funeral was beautiful and everyone asked about you. Honey, I wanted to tell you that I really understand why you couldn't come today. I know how important your work is, and I'm so proud of you. I love you. I guess that's-- [beep] Hi. Wow. You look sad. I just need you to show me how my key works again. You just stick it in the lock and turn it. I know. I keep getting it wrong. Are you OK? Not really. Maybe you could talk to me. Let's go open your door. Well, you could talk to me though. I don't know what to say. Don't say anything. [vehicle approaches] [sighs] [sniffles] The tears of an artist are very precious. They're supposed to bring vivid dreams. â™ª [knocking at door] I'll get it. [sniffles] Yeah, hi. Oh, fuck. -Hi. -Hi. Aren't you going to say anything? -I should go. -No. Oh, no. Stay. Erica. This involves her. You were--you were the one tongue diving my boyfriend just now, right? Yeah. Yeah, that's what I thought. So you can stay. This is bullshit. [exhales] Why do we all sit down. Camille, isn't it? Yeah? Sit. You're so calm. I'd be a mess. Well, sweetie, that's the difference between you and me. Sit down. Erica, we should do this, just you and me. Let me ask you something. Are you aware of the responsibility that you have just taken on? What do you mean? Well, you've just decided to become significant in the life of my boyfriend. Did you-- did you intend to do that? I don't know. Do you know that you have a choice? That you can use your sexuality responsibility, and then not to get attention? -No. -Erica. No she needs to know this. OK. Tell me what happened before I got here. I came in to get him to let me into my house. You don't have a key? No, I have a key. I just couldn't figure out how to get it to work. You can't work a key. No, I can. But-- OK, OK, OK. You come over here, the little victim, soliciting help from him, right? No, I just needed to get into my house. [sighs] Don't you see how you sold yourself out? You are perfectly capable of opening any door you have the key to. You have to be effective in your thinking and stop hoping that some man is going to come along and rescue you. You're right. Oh, please. OK. Then what happened? Well, then I saw him, and he look so sad. Aw. I thought he needed someone to talk to. But you weren't talking when I saw you. I was comforting him. No. No, you can think that, but that is an illusion. You were using your sexuality irresponsibly instead of effectively communicating. Now, I mean, women do this. I used to do this. It's like you think that if you give affection to a man, it might turn up meaning something about you. That you're a worthy person or a loving person, but it doesn't. You end up sacrificing your self-respect for the illusion of intimacy. I never thought of it like that. Yeah. Well, start. And you? I can't believe it. I mean what have we been through? What are we working toward? Are you finished? What? Are you finished with your little show? -Do you want me to go? -Yes. OK. Can I have your number? You're really inspiring. Oh... Um... There. Here you go. Aw. How cute. CALEB: Jesus. [door opens, closes] Can't believe what I just saw. Fuck, Erica, I don't know. I just think we make better friends. What's that mean? I don't know. You don't feel that? Are you saying you're not attracted to me? Erica. Is that what you're saying? Because if it is, I want to hear it. Why are you doing this? Tell me the truth. I don't want to hurt you. What do you think you're doing, Caleb? I mean, you're it. You're my perfect mate. You're funny and handsome, and talented and smart. You make me feel good. You get me. Baby, we're perfect for each other. I don't... I don't think so. Why? Why? Why? What is it that you need? I don't know. You do. You know because you're not getting it, so you know. I need to feel special. -What? -I need to feel special. I don't need to talk everything out. I don't need to analyze everything until it makes logical sense. Some things don't make sense! They just don't. And that's what beautiful about them. They exist. My feelings exist. Instead of making me feel stupid for having them, I want someone who's going to love me because of them, because I don't make sense. You know people might respect you for your perfection, but they love you for your flaws. You don't love me for mine. Because deep down, Erica, I don't know that they're yours. You have to listened to so much enlightened shit, that you've been eclipse. There'll be moments when it's just you, but then you'll spout some philosophy and you'll go away. I don't believe it. I don't. No one has ever taught me or told me anything that I didn't already know everyone has them, Caleb. Fuck. We don't learn. We remember. This is me, Caleb. I want you with me. And if you don't want to be with me, have the courage to say you don't want to be with me. Don't make me out to be some fucking brainwashed new aged moonie or something. God damn it. Acknowledge that I exist as a whole, unique person. OK. OK. You exist as a whole, unique person. And I do love you and respect you-- You just don't want to fuck me. It's not that. Caleb, tell me the truth. I just don't want to fuck you. [breathing deeply] Thank you. Erica, we can be friends. Yeah, sure. If I ever stop missing the sex. So that's it? You're just going to go? What do you want me to do? I don't know. Should I stay here and comfort you? I don't know. You OK? I'm going to go. No, answer me. Are you OK? No, I'm not fucking OK. I'm fucking heartbroken. I mean, Jesus, what do you think I am, a machine? You've broken my heart, Caleb. I feel stupid, ugly, and unloved. And I just want to get out of here. I want to get out of here, and get on with whatever it is I need to get on with. I don't feel like talking. I don't feel like listening. I feel like a piece of my world is ending, and I just... I'd very much appreciate it if you could respect that and just let me leave. Hmm? -Erica. -What? What are you going to do for me? Take me into that room, make love to me and tell me, it's all some misunderstanding? It's all OK. Make it like it was. Are you? No. [sighs] Yeah, then there's nothing I can do for you. You know what? Maybe we can be friends. But don't ask me that now, because then I have to admit that we don't have the other, and I'm doing everything in my power to resist that. Please. Please, Caleb, if you love me at all, let me walk out of here. I feel like shit. I want you too. I really, really want you too. But don't say anything, just let me go. â™ª What are you doing? I'm going to be leaving for a while. Leaving? Where are you going? Alaska. What? Alaska. The light is amazing in Alaska. I can get some painting done, clear my head out. What are you going to do for money? I got a job on a commercial fishing boat. I was reading some Hemingway the other night. It just hit me. So...so you're just going just like that? Well, no. We're still friends. I just... I need to get out of here for a while, get some new experiences, sort some things out. How are you doing? You know where I could score some heroine? Yeah, what's going on? I wish I drank. This would be a perfect time to get shitfaced. What happened? What happened? Absolutely everything that could go wrong today did, everything. I'm through the looking glass here. Everything is fucked up, Gerry fucked, and fucked out. I bet I got you beat. What do you mean? I would bet you that my last several hours have been more soul crushingly sucky than yours. Impossible. Bet? What happened to you? She wouldn't let me drive her there. So I go to this place, with ducks on the wallpaper, and dark wood and hunter green corduroy couches and shit. I mean the place looks like a law library. Then I figure they're trying to make the men comfortable, it is the man who have to wait in these places. And then she comes out. And she's wearing a diaper. She's wearing a paper diaper, and she's delirious on pain killers. And she's mumbling about a corn beef sandwich and a cream soda or something. She's just standing there mumbling like an infant in a paper diaper. Then she turns to me, suddenly lucid, and says, "Did you bring the money?" I say, "Yes." She says you can pay the lady at the desk on your way out. But then it hits me. I got nothing to leave. I don't have a life. There is nothing that really means anything to me. The one thing that could've meant something to me, has just joined the Los Angeles sewer system. You win. You fucking win. I fucking win. So you're going to Alaska. So I'm going to Alaska. [sighs] â™ª [sighs] I had a horrible dream. I dreamt that you broke up with me. Go back to sleep. [crying] â™ª What's going on? Tell him. Caleb. Hi, I have something to tell you. Where are you going? -I'm moving. -Camille. Camille, say it like you mean it. -I'm moving. -You just got here. She needs to be around female energy. I need to be around female energy. -Really? -Yeah, she's moving in with me. Oh, so you're the female energy? Ah. It's just you and some cats at your place. Yeah, well, it's a start. -Aren't they female cats? -Good point. Can I talk to you for a minute, over here? Sure. What the fuck are you doing? What do you mean? She's moving in with you? You hardly know her. Well, that didn't stop you. When did all this happen? I gave her my number. You were there. She called me a couple of times with a--with a personal problem. What kind of personal problem? Personal problem, one that I'm sure is unique to her, but a problem nonetheless. What? She didn't... She didn't know--she don't know how to put in a tampon. You got to be kidding me. Wh--what do you expect? She's an artist. Besides I've got the house in Venice, I could use a break on the rent. I mean you know how that is. -Erica. -No. It's as good a move for me as it is for her. I will teach her some basic life skills. And...I won't have to go home to an empty house. -It'll get easier. -You don't know that. No. You don't-- you do not have to say anything. [sighs] -Camille. -Yeah. Camille, we're going. Did you know these flowers were edible? No. You've been eating my flowers? [sighs] Oh... Right. â™ª [vehicle approaching] [engine turns off] Interesting sign. It's a little terse but to the point. So where are you going to live? That's a very good question. I almost packed this by accident. Rilke. I forgot I gave this to you. There's no inscription in it. I thought you might want it. It's from my grandmother. I can't remember her giving me this. Well, there was this poem in here she loved. She--she marked it. "Moving forward. "The deeps part of my life pour onward, "As if the river shores were opening out, "It seems that things are more like me now, "That I can see farther into paintings. "I feel closer to what language can't reach. "With my senses, as with birds, "I climb into the windy heaven out of the oak. "And in the ponds broken off from the sky, My feeling sinks as if standing on fishes." It's beautiful. Why can't I remember her giving me this? Maybe because that's not important. What's important is that you have it and what you do with it. Do you think I could make my living as a sculptor? I think that's the wrong question. Could you live without sculpting? I have. Ah, but was that living? I guess it's never that simple. It's a start. I think being an artist has very little to do with talent. I think it's mostly about intention. Whether you make a living at it or not, that's for the future to decide. I like that. Good. Now stand up and give me a hug. I'm going to Alaska. You take care of yourself. The universe will do that for me as long as I let it. It's a wonderful time to be alive, Caleb. â™ª Rocket girl, look out! No, no, that is just too hysterical. Now bring it down, Erica. Bring it way down. â™ª Oh, hey, rocket girl, look out. Oh--that's too casual. What, I'm fucking Brando? Rocket girl! Rocket girl, no! Oh, my God. â™ª Rocket! Rocket! Oh, I suck! Why do I suck all of a sudden? People, five minutes to picture, please! Ahh. God! Ugh! Where the hell is my half gingko half cold press primrose rutummy tamer tea? You people are killing me! Does anybody have a 20 on that bitch's rag tonic? Rocket girl! Hey, Jiffy puff, what are you, background, huh? It's--it's engine technician one, technically. -Hey, that's cool. -Thanks. Holding area is over there. Bye. Thanks. Yeah, yeah, great. [whirring] Yeah, see? See? Watch her, learn. You're the only one that knows what the fuck she's doing. Thanks, sweetheart. Unh. â™ª Beautiful, baby. Find me, baby. Find me. Find me. Are we ready to shoot yet? [shutter clicking] It's a nonsmoking set. Fuck off! Would you just leave me alone? God! Dolly back. Please. Dolly back. Damn it! What the hell is she doing here? I am rocket girl. â™ª
