Those days you're attracting too much attention And if you are not able to handle your own security how will you handle mine during the election Don't worry there is no Orsini anymore The corsican monopoly is over You are wrong. There are still some heirs. Miss Orsini He has absolutely no contact anymore with his family He's living the other side of the world in .. In Bangkok in Thailand Your price will be ours Mr Di Fusco Everything should be settled before the election Before the election! Let it be Orsini... You're leaving tomorrow! It will cost you 50000 dollars Should you really leave tonight? Well, the president journey was a little bit of improvisation Everything went fine, but I have to be in Marseille tomorrow night At the security department everybody is really nervous In fact, you became a kind of cop A kind of cop, yes So we haven't clear out all this yet!?

Go faster! And give me this bottle They're getting closer, faster! All the guys from his plantation are former members of his commando We'll get them at Sawalfon ferry Be careful with this curve It hurts, my back is broken Who was with you? - It hurts.. / - Who! / - An american / - His name - Di Fusco - Where did you take him? I'm gonna die Get me out from here - Where did you take him? - Downtown in a disco The name of the disco Saint Hubert at... The other can have move very far away But how did it happen?

Yes, that's him the boss He's candidate at the election He's hiring for his campaign SAC's guys Are there others? This is all I know And me, why me? What do I care about politics? I didn't ask, I was paid for a job a name and a place that's all You have failed You killed someone not involved with all this shit This the first time I did it wrong Well this is the last Hey Louis You won't go much further than your brothers We don't know each others, You're leaving first and will meet tonight as already planned Are you ok? Does your arm hurt? Let me introduce you the police officer Pedrinelli He's working on the case Listen, I have to tell you for the little girl I know, I received your wire bring me to the hospital She's dead She has been waiting for you, Mr Orsini, as long as she could But this morning, she ran out of strenght. How did it happen? It was at night We were waiting for the bus, your daughter and I They came by car They machin-gunned the bus stop But why? They thought I was you You were their target You know, doctors have done everything they could She died alone What is he still doing here? We are working together So, you're counting on Mason to prevent me doing stupid things No this is not the case Louis But each time, that someone important is coming from the USA Ambassy services are alerted. This is just my job - Someone important? - Di Fusco Does it ring a bell to you? A mafia killer. FBI told us about him travelling to Europe Your brother's death could be his work. As usual you're not up-to-date. Your Di Fusco is in Bangkok and he will stay there... Is he dead? Self-Defence - I'm at your disposal for the investigation. What are you going to do? Well, I'll bring the girl back home to burry her near our mother. Well, I'll have a pastis. One coffee. With chicory Louis, don't mess up Let the police do his job Police? We're doing our maximum Yes, maybe So, since it all begun how many did you arrest? We question about 100 people. Well I can imagine, 50 corsicans and 50 guys from SACS to be fair And for which results? We need time. And you need to be careful because election are close So one is a friend of the major, the other one of the chief constable Walking on eggs and as soon as it cracks, one slow down We are doing our maximum Sure! So you told me that it happened at night at a bus station Yes Your flight was late So, why the whole day spent in Marseille? You should have brought the girl at boarding school by the first train We missed it Why? We missed it, That's all! Ah, and you missed the next one and the one after as well Why? I will tell you why Have you really stopped drinking? Or you keep on getting drunk discretely? You got drunk in the plane, right? Easy to get bored in a plane So, from time to time a sign towards hostess And when one land, one can not see well nor walk straight So one leave half drunk with a little girl on his side When are you flying back Mr Orsini I will do the maximum for you but don't expect the impossible I didn't ask you anything. Is Mrs Orsini here? Who shall I announce? Where is she? On the terrace, but .. Ok thanks, I know the way Are you in the Police? Oh, my name is Orsini It is written on the front door! Why didn't you tell me about your arrival? Why? Am I supposed to warn anyone when coming home I first went to the hospital I understand She died alone, without anyone apart a nurse That's true, I did not find the courage to visit her This is for such cowardice that I blame you First Lucien, then Marc and now the little girl So I would like to understand You're the only one able to tell me what happend Marc didn't tell me anything about his business I already explained that to the police officer But I'm not a police offer I am one Orsini talking to one Orsini Exactly. Don't you believe that all this affair must cease But you don't understand?!! They killed my daughter!!! And I want everyone of them to die Don't act like your brothers You have always been different from other Orsini At least from Marc I already told you once 5 years ago Do you remember it? Yes perfectly I even remember what I did answered you That marc was my Husband and your brother and nothing changed You never tried to understand why I did marry your brother Today, the superintendent Pedrinelli talk to me 3 feet away, hat in hands I became a Lady And I'm living like a lady Hum, and this is a big difference If I left, this is because I never wanted to be a "sir" You see, I intend to stay here But finally I'd rather find an hotel I'm disgusted by this house for what it represents now We won't manage to understand each others I would like to help you Are you gonna join me at Alvarez's and his minders? Are you gonna visit Forestier with me? Why are you after Forestier? He's only a real estate promoter, Marseille's biggest This is the biggest crook from Marseille You're wrong Louis He even stands for election All the more reason A lot of people envy him and critic his methods, but... nowadays politics requires some discipline And everybody knows that he'll be elected If I gave him enough time This is Marc's revolver This at least did not change If you need it, it's yours Thanks, part of my inheritance? At least you are not someone who change his mind easyly I have nothing to loose, nothing Orsini, I booked a flat I had a long journey, I'm tired, don't want to be disturb Allo, give me the central police station What is it? Is this an accident? A gaz suicide. He's not dead? Where did they bring him? Probably In the hospital! Has he been questionned? What? On a drip? You'll have to question him as soon as he recovers Leave someone next to him permanently Alvarez got stabbed and he's in hospital - Do we know who did that? - No. In any case, it can't be Louis Orsini as he was with his sister-in-law I did put him under surveillance, what do you think??! Of course, this is natural We took care of the Fusco case in Bangkok Case close. Are you going back to Paris? Hum, captain I'm directly involved in this case. I think I would like to stay at your disposal as a witness As you wish. A maid have seen them leaving through a window running on gutters like cat, cat Speak clearly, buddy! Those who attacked Alvarez, they were 2, One maid saw they running out on roof Did she describe them? She told those was 2 chinese Chinese... In practice, chinese could be anyone coming from asia Maybe they arrived in the same plane as Orsini Call the airport Ask the boarding list of the 713 flight Ask if there were some chinese, asian people, and get their files So about Orsini, let's continue shadowing but discreetly, as we have nothing against him He was at its sister-in-law place By the way, what do you think about orsini's widow? She has 2 nice breast What were you doing here? Hurry up call the police You're surrounded In the name of the law, surrender! So, this hospital, anyone can enter freely One can finish off wounded people in their beds Were'nt we supposed to guard this Alvarez!! Poirier was there, but he got knocked out He was lucky not to get stabbed - Give me the files! - Here, chief 713 flight from Bangkok Nguyen and chan, both vietnamese May I? You're welcome, commandant I have something else Chan has a cousin in Marseille A cousin? Yes. He owns a small restaurant the gold cricket You should try it, they have a great Nioc man Is that all!!! No police officer. Chan's cousin was in cobra commando. While we were following Orsini the others did the job I was sure that he will never give up Not Louis Orsini Clever and Fast guy Are we keeping a watch on his hotel Melun and Santoni They've just called Louis Orsini stayed in his room, in Do not disturb mode Will you arrest him? - Only if he leaves the hotel, tell it to Melun / - O.K. Then, arrange a surveillance at the Sac 's building, discreetly - And one also around the "gold cricket" - Already done sir Well done So here we are, the big push Not for pleasure, I disapprove Orsini but I can understand him But this does not prevent you from protecting "La sac", isn't it? Come on commandant, this is our duty!! We have received orders from the top! Mr Forestier asked for police protection and did obtain it So what? It never happen in America? Yes, it happens But, Mr Forestier gets everything he asks What will happen if he gets elected Tell me! Isn't it Orsini who put all this trouble? You perfectly know that it is Forestier and his band. But you won't arrest them. Easy talking, do you believe I can change evrything on my own? I have a woman, 4 kids and soon retired and I'm not Eliot Ness This is always cops'fault!! Change the regime, the society, and maybe cops will change as well You've got to understand him What are you doing here? Let me go through Don't go there, Louis Forestier is protected by an army of cop Who is Forestier? Pedrinelli knows that you did not came alone from Bangkok Nguyen got caught by Police He's dead And chan? He escaped Stop it there Louis. You have no chance. Is it you giving advices?

And you perfectly know it This was a bad work Mistake Orsini with a U.S. cop, Miss the man, Kill the child Nothing to be proud of, but it is done now Nothing can be changed! I didn't know for the girl! You're the one who wanted that! You dit it all!! We did it together I did it for you, and you did it for me Do you know why I loved you? Because I had respect for you.

Real estate traffic, false auctions, racket, all the proof are there, all! Holy shit! This will make a lot of noise around the prefecture Do you really believe they will let us investigate up to this level? Yes that's me Oh, this is perfect, perfect. Congratulate them on my behalf Not only did he cross the roadblock but he lost the motorcycle cops as well It will be difficult to find him back He's looking for her Of course Tell me, Melun can't you think about it sooner? I think the best way to protect Mrs Orsini is to arrest her, don't you think? Yes I do, but we need to find her first I know where she stays But you'll be nice to me Mr Police officer. I did nothing wrong. I know Listen to me Either you tell now where is Sylvaine Orsini Either you will not be able to tell anything for a long time So? Did make up your mind? Will you put me under parole? She's at the Roseraie It was easy, I knew you could. The roseraie is their family villa near Cassis If Orsini knows she's there So let's go then, take as many agent as you can Pedrinelli Let me go there Are you kidding me?!!! Don't you think the bill is big enough?! That's my point. If you send your artillery, he will shoot If I go, he will listen to me Both of us know perfectly where we are there. We can not left him over I owe him, at least a chance. You'll bring him back to me You have my word I gave you half an hour, after that I'll send them out I was waiting for you The last wish of the sentenced to death Louis Orsini The righther of wrongs He did not hear the defendant but he pronounced its verdict Am I wrong? The admirable Orsini's tradition For one eye, both eyes for a teeth, the whole jaw Honor is the central value in Orsini family Marc used to talk about it a lot Talk me about Genevieve instead What do you expect? That I will lay down at your feet? Yes, I was Forestier's lover But for Genevi鋦e I was not aware I was not aware! I learnt it from the newspapers If you told me that yesterday I would have believed you I am ashamed Do you remember your journey 5 years ago? If Marc was not there you would have loved me Marc was there. What about now? Now, there is this story between us Go take your coat I bring you at Pedrinelli's police office You haven't understood anything Louis I know you're here I know you can see me So, what are you waiting to shoot? You will never be able to escape, Louis You can kill 1 or 2 cops and after? You know well that you will get shot What will be the point? Sylvaine She's dead You're well advanced now. This aint' me she killed herself Let me handle it, Louis And you may be able to go back to Sawalfon Di Fusco This was self-defence And for the others, no jury could be insensitive to your motives I will testify for you That's too late, I won't get Genevi鋦e back What about you? Who will testify for you? The day when it happened, I did not drink Not a single drop You must believe me This does not change much but I believe you Now, give me your gun No Congratulations old cop you're in good shape I've got to leave You can keep the gun in memory of a good friend Listen Louis Stop here That's enough Don't force me to shoot in the legs Don't you think it's too much, no?
