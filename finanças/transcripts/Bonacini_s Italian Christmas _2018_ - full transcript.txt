♪ BONACINI: Christmas in Italy... glowing trees in every piazza, bustling streets adorned with twinkling lights. Like many Italians, I have my feast on Christmas Eve, and it features salt cod mousse on crispy polenta crostini, pasta stuffed with rustic potato, fresh mint and cheese, sweet, tender swordfish, crispy fennel and juicy blood orange salad, pork shoulder braised in milk with roasted vegetables, and finally, espresso zabione. This is my Italian Christmas. ♪ An Italian Christmas Eve feast simply must have at least one fish dish, and this is Baccala... salted cod. And I'm going to magically transform that into a light, airy, flavourful mousse served on top of polenta crostini. But before I do that, step one has to take place. And this salt cod is so salty and dry and leathery, you could not eat it just like this. So, what's important is to soak it for at least a full day in cold water and changing that water several times to reach the perfect saltiness. Christmas in Italy is as much about the food that gets prepared, family and friends that come over, and about all the craziness that ensues. ♪ One of the best ways to cook salt cod is in a small pot, water and a little milk. The milk actually helps mellow down the big flavours of the cod. And by salting the cod, it adds a wonderful firm texture, which is perfect for turning this mixture into a light and airy mousse. And the gloves of garlic add their own unique layer of flavour. A couple of bay leaves for a touch of earthiness and a gentle simmer. Ready for the next step. My little twist to the sharable antipasti is to serve it on polenta crostini. See how easy that came out of the pan? Using a small cutter, something that gives you about a good bite-size for these antipasto to be shared. Just simply cut one disc at a time. The perfect little foundation to serve a salt cod mousse. ♪ ♪ Go get the old chimney sweeper ♪ ♪ Make sure the chimney is clear ♪ ♪ Time to get humming ♪ ♪ Santa is coming ♪ ♪ I love this time of the year ♪ ♪ I'll set the tree by the mantle ♪ ♪ You'll wrap the presents, my dear ♪ ♪ Let's make the dishes ♪ ♪ Everyone wishes ♪ ♪ I love this time of the year ♪ My salt cod is ready for the next step. It's fully cooked and it's starting to become really light and flaky. So, a quick transport into the food processor, minus the bay leaves. But I want to keep those garlic cloves 'cause they are going to continue to add great flavour. ♪ And this is where the magic begins. A really good amount of olive oil. ♪ A good crack of pepper. ♪ [WHIRRING] ♪ That looks really good. ♪ You can make a quenelle, which is a fancy culinary term for shaping a little mound of mousse between two spoons, so you end up with a little football shape. ♪ Simple little garnish of parsley. ♪ Almost done. ♪ Such great flavours. The texture is what really hits you first. It is so creamy and soft, and served on top of warm grilled polenta. That little charring just adds a wonderful, magical touch to it. Really is a great way to start off and Italian Christmas Eve Feast. Veneto gives us this humble yet decadent antipasto dish to start off our Christmas feast. And from Sardinia, a rustic pasta with potatoes, cheese and a little mint. ♪ Our Italian Christmas Eve feast includes a classic all the way from sunny Sardinia, home to some of the most unique dishes in all of Italy, like these culurgiones... pockets of pastas stuffed with potatoes, cheese and fresh mint. This pasta dough is really easy to make. A few simple ingredients... corn flour, egg, olive oil, water, and a little salt and, of course, some elbow grease, to make a beautiful, soft, supple dough. Now, you can always buy premade pasta dough at any good grocery store. Now, we just need to cut out my little dumpling wrappers. Culurgiones means "little bundles", which is odd because this pasta is larger than your average ravioli. ♪ Now, I've preboiled these beautiful, big potatoes until they are super fork tender, light and fluffy, and have a wonderful amount of moisture to them. And it really is just a simple case of mashing these potatoes down. ♪ Now, for a little flavouring. I've gently heated just a couple of smashed cloves of garlic in some olive oil, just to extract that wonderful garlic flavour. This garlic oil not only adds a great dimension of flavour, but adds a nice silkiness to the mashed potatoes. ♪ Now, for a unique ingredient as part of the filling... fresh, fragrant chopped mint. [WOMAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ [WOMAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] A filling for this kind of dumpling would not be complete without some cheese. And this here is a chunk of gruyere. Not what you might expect in an Italian dish. ♪ And this cheese has a mild, slightly nutty, but sweet finish to it. [WOMAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] Perfect time for a taste. ♪ Now, that's got really great flavour... cheese, mint and little, fluffy spuds. [WOMAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] So, this is where the fun begins. Just a little egg wash around the outside will help make sure that these little parcels are sealed up good and tight. A little pinch... and a fold. This is where it gets really fun with everyone involved... kids and all. And if they don't come out all the same in shape and size that doesn't matter. It's about the fun behind it. It's about getting in that Christmas spirit. ♪ While my culurgiones are cooking in the boiling, salted water, I have a very simple but perfect sauce to finish them off in. A little garlic, shallots, olive oil, and passata... strained tomatoes... simmered and seasoned to the right consistency and taste. See how the culurgiones have started to rise to the top of the boiling water? That tells me they're ready. And just ever so gently, lay them into the simmering sauce. ♪ Honestly, I could almost eat them right out of the pot and it wouldn't be the first time. ♪ Have to grab a little cheese. The finishing touch. ♪ Look at it, packed full of that creamy, cheesy, minty potato. That is so good. Oh... These kinds of dishes that come out at Christmas time are so special. Mmm. ♪ Babbo Natale would love these jolly, fat potato stuffed pasta parcels, and pretty certain he'd enjoy my next dish... a swordfish with cherry tomatoes, briny capers and olives... a Christmas secondo. ♪ Don't you just love the smell of freshly brewed coffee? I know I od. It's an aroma I never seem to get tired of. And this heady, aromatic brew of coffee is perfect for my up and coming dessert. But first, it needs to cool down a little, whilst I get on with my secondo... pesce spada alla ghiotta, which simply means "swordfish, capers, tomatoes and olives." Take a look at this gorgeous swordfish steak. That's cut right from the loin. And what I love about this is its texture, its density. It has a sweetness to it. In fact, I often think of this as steak of the sea. ♪ And swordfish is a lean fish, so you have to keep your eye on it whilst you're cooking. To get things going, I need to sear off my swordfish. Now, that needs to be done in a good hot pan, but still with a little gentle care. ♪ Now, that's a lovely caramelized and seared swordfish steak. ♪ Using the same pan, garlic, and then, these beautiful, plump, sugary, sweet pomodorini... small tomatoes or cherry tomatoes. And what I love about these is they blister, they shrivel, they become super juicy, and they burst in your mouth. ♪ Fiery heat from these chillies, the sweetness of the tomatoes, all balances out. Add my capers for that briny, salty little hit. And these gorgeous, earthy, aromatic olives... green and black. To bring it all together, a good glug of crisp pinot grigio. ♪ And any of the juices don't go to waste. Down to a gentle, gentle simmer. Lid slightly ajar for a couple of minutes. Oh... A little cold butter and a quick stir around. And this technique is called monté au beurre... classic French, but also used in Italy. And it just brings that sauce together, enrichens it and gives it a nice little sheen. You know, I'm tempted to serve it just in the pan as it is. Because it is Christmas, we're going to dress it up just a little. ♪ And just a little parsley. This is a true taste of a Calabrian and Sicilian Christmas dinner. See that just touch of blushing pink? That's pretty perfect in my mind. That is so tender, so succulent, and full of flavour, and it comes together so quickly. It is a quick, easy dish that you can knock out for a big family at a Christmas dinner or a Christmas Eve feast. That was a great secondo. How about we go next deep into Sicily for a palette cleansing salad course between our two secondi? ♪ When Sicilians prepare a Christmas feast, it more often than not will include a fennel and orange salad. And that cool, crunchy, liquorice flavour from the fennel and the sweet juice of those blood oranges makes this a perfect side dish for my Christmas feast. And these gorgeous feathery fronds, I'm going to hang onto those 'cause I have a plan for them a little later on. ♪ Just a quick cutting out of the core of my fennel before slicing it on a mandolin, which is a great kitchen gadget. And this really ensures that I have good, even, thinly sliced fennel. ♪ Adding fennel to ice water helps them crisp up. Cutting the bulb super fine makes it easy to twirl onto your fork. Plus, I think it looks lovely. Now, every good salad needs a little great dressing. And take a look at the colour of these oranges. That is blood orange. And it's that unique colour that provides amazing taste and makes a perfect dressing. Little olive oil, balance out the sweetness and acidity. And this, white balsamic, has that great intensity of flavour. A little whisk up. Now, I'm gonna let my salad dressing sit, so those flavours come together and give it a final taste before I actually dress the salad. Back to these beauties. To prepare these oranges for the salad, simply top and tail and then start to remove the skin, along with the pith. ♪ So, to put the salad together, it's really easy 'cause all the prep is done. A few oranges in the bottom. My sliced fennel. And a light, fluffy amount in the bowl. You remember these fronds? This is where they come to action. Now, I love toasted pine nuts, and toasting them really brings them to life. You get that nutty flavour, but you also get that rich, butteriness to the nuts. Now, it's back to the dressing. It's had a chance to sit and flavours to mellow out. And the colour looks beautiful. Just a little more pepper. A little of the dressing. And then, just a gentle toss. ♪ ♪ I'm really happy with the way the salad turned out. It looks amazing. It just smells absolutely delightful. And that balance of the orange and the liquorice from the fennel, I know is going to be a winner. Just look at the colour. Absolutely beautiful. That wonderful sweet, slightly acidic blood orange, that cool fennel liquorice background, the little hit of white balsamic vinegar, and then this buttery, nutty flavour that comes from everywhere but nowhere, it's those pine nuts... all together, they are simply delightful. In Italy, this dish is often served to bridge two courses, such as meat and fish. It's certainly readied my palette for our final secondo... braised pork in milk... yes, I did say milk... until it is fall-apart tender on a bed of carrots, chestnuts and apple. ♪ It's been tradition in Italy not to eat meat until Christmas Day. But nowadays, more and more families seem to be preparing a roast for Christmas Eve. And I've chosen to do a long, slow braised pork shoulder and I'm serving it with some coloured roasted Christmas veggies. It starts off with two things... good seasoning, followed by a good sear. ♪ And this is what we chefs like to call highly seasoned. ♪ Over to the pot. Now, for a good searing in olive oil and a little butter. [SIZZLING] And the idea behind the searing is it gives great caramelization and colour, depth of flavour, and I love those little sticky bits that end up on the bottom of the pan that help the sauce become really rich and dense. ♪ [SIZZLING LOUDLY] Take a look at that. Now, that is a good searing. Now, for a little more flavouring. Crushed garlic. Wonderful, fragrant rosemary. And some earthy sage. Just let those flavours come out before we add... a good hit of white wine. [SIZZLING LOUDLY] That sounds really good. And just the colour and the aroma coming out of this pot right now, it amazing. Now... milk and cream, like I promised. In goes the milk and that lovely rich cream. [MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] The idea of using milk and cream when cooking a pork dish like this, one... it adds richness of flavour, two... the lactic acids within the milk and cream help tenderize. Time for the lid to go on. Down to a gentle simmer. And pretty much, my work is done. Time to grab a glass of wine and prepare a few Christmas veggies. [MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ This looks so good. Gently take the pork out of its milk bath. Just let that relax... under some tented foil, whilst we get onto the sauce. But before we do that, I got to show you the curd that has happened within the pot. Look at that. And it's that curd that I'm going to transform into delicious, silky-smooth sauce to be served with the pork roast. Remove a few of these stalks from the herbs. Many families will just serve that curd right over the sliced pork as it is. I like to pour it all into a blender and buzz it up into a really tasty, smooth sauce. Got to have a quick taste. That is good. Really rich, really intense, and magically, the seasoning is spot on. Sauce is ready. Let's plate this up. Now, I know this pork is super, super tender just because of the long, slow cooking it's had. So, a little gentle on the slicing. ♪ You can see how moist it is. Fall apart tender. ♪ ♪ Two, three, four ♪ There. Onto a serving platter. ♪ All this needs now are my roasted root vegetables. Look at these. Roasted carrots, chestnuts, Cipollini onions, and a few apples... delicious things to go with a roast pork. And a drizzle of this delicious creamy sauce. And, of course, a little extra always on the side. ♪ Just looking at that pork, you can tell how tender it is. Literally melts in my mouth. And the sticky roasted chestnut. Simple ingredients prepared well, it's the perfect way to celebrate any Christmas. This would definitely please Babbo Natale. But that being said, no Christmas meal would be complete without a little dessert. How about a warm zabione with panettone? ♪ Panettone, it is a light, fluffy, sweet bread, studded with candied fruit. And all across Italy, you'll see Italians carrying boxes of these made at their local pasticceria, and it is a quintessential dessert during the Christmas holidays. I made this apricot and pistachio panettone, which I'm going to smother in a light, creamy custard, known as a sabayon... or a zabione... with espresso. And that all begins with beautiful egg yolks. Zabione is traditionally made with sweet wine or a little fortified wine. But I'm going for a little espresso because I think that coffee hit and my cooling panettone, they're going to work so well together. And the aromas coming from the panettone are just amazing. Little espresso. ♪ I drink it hot and I love it cold. Now, the trick with zabione is really to incorporate as much air as you possibly can, whilst cooking the egg yolks gently over a bagnomaria or a bain-marie. Here we go. [MAN SINGING IN ITALIAN] ♪ You have to take a look at this. See how much volume I've got? That's all the air being incorporated over the slowly cooked egg yolks. Turn this off. Look at that. Now, just a little vanilla to finish it off. ♪ Mmm... That is going to be good. Time to cut up the panettone. Look at that. Beautiful. And the smell is still incredible. So, what I want to do is really just cut it into one inch cubes. And to make it easy, I'll just take off those two ends. See how light and fluffy it is? All those air pockets in there, pistachio, apricot... all the good things. ♪ What I like to do with my panettone is just toast it up a touch. Little non-stick pan and just a touch of butter, just to keep things loose. ♪ You know, I have to say, it's really starting to smell a lot like Christmas here. The aromas from this panettone are just beautiful and my kitchen is full of that kind of wonderful, warm baked good aroma, which I love during the holidays. It gets me pretty excited. ♪ My panettone's nicely toasted up, has a little crunch... [SNIFFING] ...and it still smells amazing. Mmm... So, the fun part is to build the dessert, and it starts off with a good layer of my espresso zabione. ♪ That is smothering, toasty, crispy-crunchy panettone. But all the great flavours. ♪ And to finish off, a light dusting of cocoa. ♪ I can't wait to tuck into this dessert. I love a nice glass of chilled Asti Spumante... when I have a little dessert, especially at Christmas, and this fits the bill. [SNIFFING] Oh, it smells so good. Look at that panettone dessert towering high. [SNIFFING] Oh, it smells so very, very good. Mmm... The panettone still warm, little crispy and crunchy on the outside from the toasting, and those little sweet hits of apricot and pistachio. Christmas in Italy is all about gathering with family and enjoying a luxuriously long meal. I've taken you from Christmas in Veneto with sweet salt cod on crispy polenta crostini. Then, to the island of Sardinia for pasta stuffed with potato, cheese and mint. On down the coast to Calabria and Sicily for swordfish with sweet cherry tomato, briny capers and olives. We stayed in Sicily for crispy fennel and juicy blood orange salad. Then, back up north to Emilia-Romagna for tender pork braised in milk. And finally, to end our Christmas Eve feast, this creamy espresso zabione... popular throughout Italy... served with a famous panettone. From my Italian Christmas Eve table to yours, a feast fit for Babbo Natale. ♪
