Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. It has been three months since my last confession. I've disobeyed my parents many times. I've taken the Lord's name in vain. Many times. I've had sinful relations with boys at my school. Many boys. Many times. My child, these are great sins. You must prepare yourself for the consequences. Father, there's one more thing. What is it, my poor child? I loved every minute of it. Tutti frutti All over rootie I got a girl named Sue She knows just what to do I got a girl named Sue She knows just what to do She rock to the east She rock to the west But she's the girl that I love best Tutti frutti All over rootie I got a girl named Daisy Thanks for the ring, Billy. It's really cool. You look really beautiful tonight, Mary Lou. Really? Could you get me a glass of punch, please? Sure. Don't go away. I won't. Tutti frutti All over rootie Hey, Nordham, neat prom, huh? Yeah. Have you seen Mary Lou? She went behind the stage with Cooper. - When'd you guys break up, anyway? - We didn't. Bud Cooper strikes again. What do you go out with that square for anyway? 'Cause he treats me right. And his daddy's rich. Rich enough to make Billy cool. So why do you go out with me? Because it's a big free country. God bless America. You shit! Hey, Nordham. Be cool, Billy. We weren't doing anything. Speak for yourself. We've been petting for a year and you never went this far. A year! You want to shake? It's just as close as you're gonna get. Tutti frutti All over rootie - Cheers. - Cheers. You came with me. It's not who you come with, it's who takes you home. Scram! See you later, alligator. - How much did you put in? - Enough. It'll stink up the whole place. Romero's coming! Hide the stink bomb. Enjoying the prom? Not much. You? The music's too loud. This rock and roll will never last. Well, it's time to announce the prom queen for 1957 at Hamilton High. The winner is... Drum roll, please. Mary Lou Maloney! She took my diamond ring She took my watch and chain She took the keys to my Cadillac car Jumped in my kitty and she drove a-far All right, let's hear it for Mary Lou Maloney, the 1957 Hamilton High Prom Queen. Never mind the stupid cape, bonehead. Just give me the crown. Told me she was sorry that she hurt me so I had a '55 Ford and a $2 bill When she took a-that, a-man, it gave me a chill She took my diamond ring She took my watch and chain She took the keys to my Cadillac car Jumped in my kitty and she drove a-far Well, she jumped in my kitty and she drove a-far Somebody help her! Mary Lou! Somebody help her! Dear Lord, bless this food we are about to receive. In the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit. Amen. I'll be late after school today. I'm going to go the mall to buy a new dress for the prom. Okay? What's wrong with your green one? Nothing. It's just... It's the senior prom, Mom. Only happens once. I suppose you're still going with that Craig Nordham. Will he be getting a sidecar for his motorcycle? Or will you be taking the bus? How much do you think you'll need? She won't need anything. I still co-sign the checks. Your green one will be just fine. There's Craig. Bye, Daddy. Bye, Mother. Some punk on a motorcycle and she jumps for him. It's young love. Remember? I guess not. Good morning, prom queen. Hey, your mother's gonna find out when you win. I'm only nominated. I'm not the winner. Not yet. I got my tux. I got my green dress. Didn't work, huh? Daddy was okay, but you know Mother. - That stuff will kill you. - Really? - What's this? - Open it. Go ahead. It's beautiful. I love it. Thank you. My mother will never believe this. - More coffee? - Oh, no, thank you. I love you. Is it a fruit? No. Is it a vegetable? No. It's a radio. Yes. When I began this experiment, they laughed. Just as you're laughing now! They said, "Josh, Josh, a potato? It'll never work." - He likes you. It is so obvious. Use something conventional. Something proven. A kiwi. - Forget it. He's a jerk. A mango. - He dresses like a wino. I wanted something radical. So I developed a guacamole radio. But that was no good. All I could pick up was stations in Mexico. Well, you can't go alone. It's the senior prom. The potato! The potato. Nature's perfect vegetable. Rich in AM, FM and carbohydrates. Josh, please, I'm sure Einstein didn't take this much time. Mr. Craven, boys and girls, this moment will be inserted into the annals of scientific history. And I think we all know how painful that can be. It's alive. All right, everybody. Just keep it down to a dull roar. I can't believe this. I'm 18. And I'm stunningly good-looking. The prom is like a week away, and I don't have a date. Excuse me, Monica. Could I speak to you after school? Get lost, asshole. So why don't guys ask me out? Wednesday. Thank you. - You forgot breakfast. - Morning. What do I have to do, hire a nanny when you go to college to make sure you eat? Hey, Dad. About college... I got a copy of your paperwork. They've got you in a dormitory on the north side. I'm not going to college. I want to take a year, you know, get a job. Live my life. - You serious? - Yeah. Yeah, I am, Dad. All of a sudden you think you're mature enough to make decisions that are gonna affect the rest of your life. Well, shit, Dad, I've been going to school for a hundred years. This frightens me, Craig. What are you afraid of? I'm afraid you're gonna throw away your whole future. I'm not going to throw it away, huh? I just want to juggle it for a while. Hey, look, I gotta go back to class. Try not to forget to eat lunch. There's no way she's gonna let me buy a new one. It's this really ugly green dress. It makes me sick. - So, what are you gonna wear? - I don't know yet. I thought I'd take a look at some old costumes in the prop room, though. - Oh, yeah! - Yeah. Maybe when I get back from the doctor's I can make something really wild. So, what are you going to the doctor's for anyway? You okay? Of course, I'm all right. It's nothing serious. It's just some dumb checkup. My mom makes me go every year. - Okay, see you. - Okay, see you. Vicki? See you later. I have to tell you guys about my dress! Oh, it is awesome. It is totally awesome. It's... It's sort of Spanish. And it's red with, like, black polka dots all over it. And it's got this bow on one shoulder. And the lady at Sears said it's the same dress that Liz Taylor wore to the Oscars. I am going to look so hot. Bill. - So, everything's okay, right? - Yes. Shit. You really wanna use this stuff for our prom? It's very classy, real glass. 1957 was not a good year for capes. Wasn't that the year the prom queen died in the fire? Nice touch, Vicki. The last person that wore this stuff died. Oh, I really hope you win, Kelly. Well, you'd better clean that crap off if you expect me to wear it. Who gives a shit? Jess? Hi. Hi. What's wrong? Nothing. Jess. There's... There's this guy... You know, and I really liked him. And I thought he really liked me. And I... And I've been trying to call him and he doesn't answer. Doesn't answer, and I've left messages, and he doesn't call me back. He sounds like a jerk. Look, Jess, I mean if he doesn't call you back, then... Yeah, I guess I've got some choices to make. Well, if I were you, I would choose to forget about this guy. Yeah. The only problem is, is he left me something to remember him by. I'm pregnant. Oh, God. What am I gonna do? I've finished cleaning the floors, Jess. I'm going home, so lock up when you leave. See you. I'm going to tell you a story about a Mary Lou I mean, the kind of a woman make a fool of you - What happened? - It's Jess. She killed herself. We can take comfort that she is with the Lord, resting in a better place. And let the violence of her passing remind us of the dangers, of the violence we see so much of every day in our streets, on our television sets and in the movies. Cute. What's the matter? I don't know. It feels weird they decided to have the prom anyway. It doesn't seem right without Jess around. No. On the case, where everybody can see it. - You got it. - Hi. How are you doing? Bell for Kell. I didn't know we could advertise. Don't bother. Oh, that's fine, guys. Just fine. Looks pretty well hung to me. Don't touch the queen. He'd be the first who didn't. The competition seems to be dwindling. You two should take the hint from Jess. You shut your fucking mouth, bitch! All right. Going to the prom? Ring a bell for Kell. Hi! Ring a bell for Kell. Billy. Nope. I'm not that desperate. Still no date. Well, I don't see a line-up for your company. Well, I'm planning to go alone. I'm gonna drink too much beer and throw up in the can. It's my duty. I'm a teenager. I love you, Mary Lou. Leave me alone. Don't. No. Leave me alone! This came for you this morning. Your forms from Western University. Well, thanks for opening it for me. I beg your pardon. Sorry. I'm not going. I'm gonna stay home for a year. Maybe work. What are you talking about? - Vicki, is there a problem? - No. Craig's gonna work for a year before he goes back to school. Craig is not the reason you're going to college. Mother, I'm a senior this year. I think I can make my own decisions! Not as long as you live under this roof. Then maybe I should move out right now. Maybe we should all think about this first and talk after dinner. Bless us, O Lord, for thy Son, Jesus Christ's sake, and forgive us... So, did you get a date for the prom? I didn't either, but I'm still gonna go, 'cause I gotta be there for the computer vote. I had this idea. What if we met at the prom, you and I, and since you're gonna be there, and I've got to be there anyway... You and I? At the prom? Together? No! No way. Well, I guess we could be at the same place at the same time, - and no one's gonna think anything. - Yeah? But they might think it's a date if they saw us kiss or something. That wouldn't happen. We better forget it. We might get tempted in the heat of the moment and sometimes that happens. What if I were to kiss you now and it would be so awful that we wouldn't be tempted later? Hey, listen, if it's a problem, we'll just deal with it tomorrow night under the hot lights with everyone watching... Is there anything else you wanna get out of the way? It's Vicki's serve. The ball, Kelly. - Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou. - Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou. - Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou. - Mary Lou. Mary Lou. Mary Lou. I'm not Mary Lou. I'm not Mary Lou. No! Mary Lou! I mean, why is it when guys see things, they get put away? When girls see things, they get put on Phil Donahue. Are you all right? I'm fine, Mother. What happened? The secretary told us you fainted, you were hurt. Vicki thinks something was... We were playing volleyball in the gym and I fainted, that's all. I probably have the flu or something. Well, maybe we should take her to see Dr. Perlzeig. She's not sick. She just needs to spend time with the Lord. Father Cooper can hear her confession tonight. Will you stay for dinner, Craig? Vicki doesn't need guests tonight. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I have had sinful thoughts about my boyfriend. And I've been angry with my mother, and disobeyed her wishes, and... There's something else. I've been seeing things. Hallucinations about Jess. And Mary Lou Maloney, that girl who died at our school. Your friend's death hurt us all, but you must always keep self-control. Pray fervently, my child, to be preserved from all evil. For your penance, pray a decade of the rosary now, make an act of contrition now, and I will give you absolution. Hey, Dad. Dinner's ready. Right. Go away. This is my room. Stop it! Stop it! Stop it! No! No! No! Leave me alone! What's going on in here? I dropped the radio. It broke. What do you want? - Vicki. - Father Cooper. What are you doing out here? It's cold. You'd better come with me. There's something happening at my school. Something about Mary Lou Maloney. Do you believe in ghosts? You're tired. It's late, and the mind plays strange tricks. It's not my mind, God damn you, it's Mary Lou Maloney! I'm sorry. Forgive me. Demon, depart. Be gone! Depart this mortal coil. The Body of Christ compels you. The Body of Christ compels you! The Body of Christ compels you! The Body of Christ compels you! The Body of Christ compels you! The Body of Christ compels you! The Body of Christ compels you! The Body of Christ compels you! Hey, Dad, pass me the wrench. There's something wrong with this goddamn shock. Sorry, Father Cooper. - Scotch? - Please. I'd appreciate a double. Aren't you on duty? - I'm not a cop. - What are you, Buddy? Scared. We're in trouble, you and I. What are you talking about? Don't jerk me around, Bill. I'm as guilty as you are. She was beautiful, wasn't she? If she'd jilted me, maybe I would've... Buddy, that was another life. We're different people now. So, why don't we forget about it, okay? I wish it was that simple, believe me. Mary Lou Maloney has come back. Please, listen to this. "If a person dies violently, unfulfilled in a life mission, "the soul wanders purgatory for eternity waiting for the opportunity to return." For revenge! Somehow, her spirit has come back from the grave, and she will come after you and me. Jesus Christ, Buddy. You've been celibate too long. She can't touch me. I'm a priest. But she will enter your body and possess you, her murderer. You must take communion to protect yourself! Don't touch me. For God's sakes, Bill, she's gonna kill you! This, this is the only thing that will protect you. I don't need protection from something that happened 30 years ago. Now, I've heard enough of this crap. Get out of my house. I'm warning you! Get out of my house. Out! All right. - You can't shut the door on the past! - Watch me. Hey, what? No straitjacket? - Shit, you look awful. - Thanks. I'm tired. I didn't get much sleep last night. So, are you gonna tell me? - What? - What's wrong? - You won't understand. - Well, why don't you try me, huh? Look, I don't understand it myself, okay? - I'm sorry. - It's okay. I don't know what's real and what isn't anymore. It's like I'm not in control of myself. I am afraid I might hurt somebody. God! I might hurt you. It's okay. - I wanna talk to you. - Hey. - Alone! - We are alone. Let me in, Josh. I'll have to frisk you for weapons. Okay, you're not here on a social call. We don't go to the same parties. I want you to fix the computer voting. Get serious. Well, I'm gonna win anyway. But I'll pay you $100 to make sure. You come down here slumming to talk to me, you think you can get me to do whatever you want. You're right of course, but... It's very insulting. No! Come on, Josh. Look, if that's not enough, name your price. You bastard. Life's a joke. Then you croak. Sorry, big guy. It's out. I mean, she was acting really weird, she was really spaced out, sort of. And then, she screamed and she fainted, right in the middle of the gym. Little Miss Perfect is losing it. Another prom queen hopeful bites the big one. Maybe we can take our own seats now, thank you very much. Thank you very much. Very nice shot. Can we settle now? Let us begin another wonderful adventure into the works of William Shakespeare. Here. I found it in my father's underwear drawer behind Miss September. What are you looking for, anyway? I'm sure you'll all recall Juliet's speech. - What do you want? - "Deny thy father and refuse thy name." - Poor Vicki. - "Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn..." Cracking up? Vicki! She slugged Kelly? She's stuck in detention until 5:00. She said you should just go home. Well, what were they fighting about? I don't know. Vicki's been acting strange all day. Is she sick or something? Maybe she's possessed. Your mother sews socks in hell, Father Karras. You know, there could be a lot of advantages in a girl whose head spins around. Your parents did a lot of acid before they had you. Just leave it in the office. In the name of the Father, the Son and the Holy Spirit. Amen. Forgive me, Father, for I have sinned. I have done terrible things. I have hurt my friends. I have given in to sexual desires with my boyfriend. I don't know what's happening to me. We all stray from the path of the Lord sometimes, child. But with penance, you will find your way again. - Will you help me, Father? - Of course, child. - Will you pray for me? - Yes. Will you fuck me? Come on, Buddy. It's a big free country. Right, Buddy? Dear God! Be gone. Depart this mortal coil. Demon, be gone! Be gone? - Come on. - Our Father, who art in heaven... There's no God, Buddy. And there's no heaven. Give us this day our daily bread... And do you know what pissed me off the most? No fucking wings. Have you seen Vicki today? No, I went to pick her up this morning, but I guess she just decided - to go on without me. - Craig, there is something weird with her. You've got to see the way she's dressed. Hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart Sweet Mary Lou I'm so in love with you I knew Mary Lou We'd never part So hello Mary Lou Goodbye heart Wow, fashion crime. What did you do? Beat up the bag lady? They're my clothes. If you don't like it, lump it. Hey, and where were you this morning? See you later, alligator. Hey, guys, wait up. Craig's with me. Scram. Get the other side. Pull it together, bonehead! Craig, what is wrong with her? I don't know. She says it's her new look. She looks like she's in a fashion coma. And she talks like we're in an Elvis Presley movie. Hey, give her a break, guys, huh? I mean, she's only trying to be an individual. I'm telling you guys, she's possessed. Linda Blairsville. All right, get the center. Yeah. Okay. We take care of the chemicals and the chemicals will take care of us. And how are you doing, Vicki? Everything looks good from here. This isn't working, Mr. Craven. Well, you need a little more heat. The heat will make the molecules move faster... - Vicki. ...thereby brewing the catalyst, our two chemicals. And making the experiment complete... She makes a young man groan and an old man pain The way she took my money was a crying shame I watched you in science class today. You did something to Craven, didn't you? Of course not. It was an accident. Look, Vicki, you need help. I'm gonna go find Craig and tell him and maybe he can get it through to you. God, Vicki, can't you see what's happening to you? Everything's swell. Nobody says swell anymore. - I'm sorry, Vicki. - That's okay. Vicki, what are you doing? Vicki! Just stay away from me, Vicki! Will somebody help me, please? Tutti Frutti All over rootie It's gonna be a hot prom. Last one. I don't know if I'm ready for the real world yet. How about some fantasy? What's the matter, Nordham? Don't you know how to use this thing? You turning into a fag, drag? What's wrong with you? Don't you want to fuck me? Vicki? Wrong. Dad! Craig! No! Looking for something, Billy? Good body. Not as good as mine was, though. Remember? Vicki? You knew I was coming, didn't you? Didn't you, Billy? I remember prom night. I was ready for the world. I could've been anything. Only you wouldn't let me wear my crown, Billy. Mary Lou? That's my name. Don't wear it out. Craig is so cool. What did he want to be? See you later, alligator. No. No! You look beautiful. Your mother and I thought we were the best-looking couple at our prom. I had my first job. I was repossessing cars. Spent my first paycheck buying your mother a corsage and a ring. And I had to wear my father's tux. You'll remember tonight forever. I hope so. Hold me, Daddy. What are you doing? What have you done? Jezebel! Harlot! You must repent your sins. Pay your penance. Father Cooper's busy right now. You're not leaving this house. Whoa, son. I gotta find Vicki, Dad. What happened? I don't know. She went crazy and attacked me. I gotta find her. No, son, you just lie back. I'll take care of it. I started this. What are you talking about, Dad? You know something about this, don't you? - Please, now, you just... - No, you gotta stop controlling my life! I gotta find her. All right then, you just be careful. All right. Where are my shoes? Right here. I'm sorry, son. She's dead. I saw her burn. I went to the funeral. You stupid bastard. Oh, Buddy. Vicki! Hey, Vicki! You look great. Seen Monica? Hi. Mary Lou speaking. Sorry I can't come to the phone right now but I'm busy at the prom. Places to go, people to kill. Don't bother leaving a message. Vicki doesn't live here anymore. You have a drinking problem. I drink. I get drunk. So, what's the problem? I spent $64 on my hair today. If you mess it up, I'll kill you! Young love. Then you croak. The winner is... Who won? I'm not supposed to tell. It wasn't you. You knew my price. This is so sudden. Put your hands on the keyboard and start entering. - Where have you been? - Come on, I want to dance. Hey, got any more of those mints? Your breath smells great. Sorry, Vicki. And the new winner is... Quiet please. Ladies and gentlemen, we're gonna pick the prom queen now. Absolute silence, please. Mavis, push the magic button, please. And the winner is... Vicki Carpenter! Hey, Kelly. How did you blow it? No! Vicki. Craig. Somebody call an ambulance. Call a fucking ambulance! It's Mr. Nordham. He's got a gun! Dad. No! You're really starting to piss me off. - Hello, Craig. - No! You're in deep shit. Craig, are you there? It's me, Vicki. Let me in! She's at the door.
