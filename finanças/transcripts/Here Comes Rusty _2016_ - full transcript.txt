Think you've gone a little tone deaf. A-E-G flat? I thought that was what I did. Huh, if I had a dime for every time I heard that, we could actually have dog racing in here. Good to see you, man. What's up? Okay. Okay, three, two, one. Where was that 10 minutes ago? That was actually D-F-G. Well, aren't you a little Jim Hendrix. Who? Big Dick, your sister's on line one. What does she want? Something about money. Yeah. I'm still waiting for that money. What the hell you need money for? The same reason I call you every month. It's not the 30th yet. You're right, you're right, it's the second. I'm not covering again for you this time. Don't you hang up on me. - I'm on my way. - Get your butt down here. Magnolia, attention. Patrons and staff, go home. The reasons have yet to be determined. And more than anything, have a nice day. Chill out. You all right? I'm okay. Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine. ♪ They look my way and every time ♪ ♪ They just seem to say ♪ ♪ He's just looking for a woman ♪ ♪ He's just looking for a pretty, pretty woman ♪ Oh, mister, mister, mister. Mister, mister, I think you know you're not supposed to park here. It's okay, junior, I'm an officer of the law. Sir, you don't look like much of a cop. If my boss comes around here, he's gonna get real upset. Son, do you want to go to jail? No, sir. If there's anything I learned, you don't dig for water under the outhouse. Shit! Get along, little doggy. Whoa, Daisy. Sorry, we don't sell wheelchairs here. Might want to start after I break your legs. Oh, hold on here, I'm just funning ya. I'm just trying to help an old man out with his problems. Step aside, cowboy. Oh come on, Dicky, you and I both know what the problem is. We know you're not gonna be able to keep the lights running at Magnolia unless you and me team up. Now's the perfect time. And it's gonna happen one way or the other. We could take that old place, turn it upside down, make it shine like a Texas star. Hells fire, look what I did with my ranch. I bought that old rundown Pizza Pizza parlor and turned it into the destination for Mobile. Well hell, I got kiddies coming up here just to ride the horses. And I'll tell you something else, partner. The people in town look up to me. Come on, don't you want to see Mak's Greyhound Park shine again? You know, fruitcake and play your band practice as long as you want. And just leave the hard work up to me. I'll give you credit, Mak, but Pizza Pizza was less than a mile away from me. Now I gotta go to Possum Grape to get good pizza. And hey, I like my pizza. And secondly, never, ever mention my guitar player Bart in front of me again. Well, hold up. What the heck are you doing, Richard? I haven't seen or talked to you in months. And from the looks of it, if I didn't keep your books, you'd still be reading palms and doing magic shows. You don't have to worry about doing the books anymore. Why? Are you broke? Are you gambling again? You're the accountant, you tell me. Well you haven't exactly been diligent with your spending. Don't hassle me, please, woman. You asked. It's rhetorical, you know? I know where my investments are. I wouldn't exactly call that stage an investment. Is this place an investment? Don't start with my marriage. What would Dad say if he saw you like this? That's a whole other conversation. Richard, I'm still willing to help you. I'll figure it out. Okay fine, you figure it out. 'Cause I'm pretty sure if you don't, Mak will. That will never happen! Why don't you just ask College for help? College is outta down and old Dicky can take care of himself as he always does. That's the response I was afraid of. I'll tell you, this big cat has nine lives. He's used seven of them up. Hey, little Dick. How has your day been? By the looks of your litter box, it's been similar to mine. What in the world you been into? That old ham on the counter? Don't worry, Daisy. Daisy is afraid that, once again, one of our used cars is gonna be out of a job. A car will never replace a horse, unless it's one of Mak's fine used cars. Come on down where the price is always right and the customer's always right. I'm giving the cars away. I'm crazy, as crazy as you'll be about our great offers. Be a star, buy a car from Mak's Used Car Ranch. Yippee! What the hell are you doing, boy? My God, Dick, what have you been doing? I leave for a few months. Place is complete disaster. Grab me some old rare wine over there, you know? And hey man, it's good to see you, College. You old grit eater. Dick. I just spoke with your sister. I'm a little confused. She said you're out of money. Is this true or false? That's false. It's true. Before I left, didn't you say you were gonna invest in slot machines and other profitable ways of electronic gaming? Yes. And now, Mak is interested in buying out Magnolia, and he'll probably be able to 'cause you haven't been listening to anything I've been telling you. We gotta do something. Do you not realize that? Or do you want to just hand the keys over to Mak right now? You're right as usual, you Southern, grit eating, pencil neck geek. What can we do? Well the first thing, we gotta change this business model. There's no way around it. Never worked. From what I hear, the only way you've ever turned a profit in this place is from derby. So it's what we have to do, even if we don't have time. We have to have a derby. Remember those great days at Magnolia? Yes. I want to bring it back. Get it back to the St. Jon class. You remember those days? Remember. Look at Leotard right there. How many races? 27. That's what I want to get back to. I mean, now the place, it reeks of cats and old corn dogs. I can get the local press to come. We can have a news conference. You're just gonna have to meet me halfway. We need to open up our options to investors. You know, just... This is the part you're probably sort of might not like. Just, you know, hear me out before you throw anything, okay? Hmm. Mak has agreed to help sponsor the promotional coverage as long as you mention his used car ranch a few times and you put a promotional banner behind you. There's no other way. Without anybody here for the big race, we just, we don't stand a chance. No investor's gonna invest in this place, I can tell you that now. Vicky can convince Mak the promotions are worth 30 grand. Let's do a charity car wash. You'll wear a bikini? If Mak isn't involved, sign me up. No. Listen, I'm gonna take the rest of the day. Order new supplies, get this place cleaned up. With what money? This money. Huh. Now, would you try and get some rest, please? - Just go, just go. - Bright and early. Fine, fine. This is unfortunate. What'd it be, boss? Bud Light, and keep them coming. - Been there, brother. - Yeah. Hey, winners never quit. Seven all day, and I've still got one more race. Well. You keep up with this cup, and I'll keep refilling it 'til you can't stand up. Alrighty, thank you, my friend. No tipping ass. My man, Keith, the baddest man in Mobile. Young blood. So this is what it comes down to? Yeah. Big Dick finally struck out. What happened while I was gone? We've been losing our asses on this new strategy he got for picking races. He opens up the books and bets on whatever dogs or horses the cat pisses on. Genius. Do you know how much money we've lost? I don't want to know. Well before, he was using a Buffalo nickel and we was rolling. Then the damn cat ate it. A nickel? Yep, took it home, waited for it to shit it out, but it never happened. What? It never came out. Must've got lodged in his intestines. So the cat's lucky. Exactly, thought it would literally piss money. Man's a mess. I leave for a few months, this place is a complete disaster. At least the bar still makes great drinks. You're a good young man, College. Hey man, look. Why don't you move to the city, get you a good job? You're smarter than everybody else around here. 'Cause I made a promise and I don't break them. Plus, how would it look for a 22 year old to turn a dying business into a thriving cash cow? No way he saves this place. Let's not give up on him just yet. Keep your head up. All right, right on, brother. Smart young man, yeah. Hi, I'm Veronica with Channel Six News, and we're out at the Magnolia Greyhound Park today. It is a beautiful day. It's sunny, the skies are clear, and we are just super excited to be here. We're waiting on Dicky right now, and Mak's about to come out as well. And we even have Elliott the Elk here with us today. Where are you going, Elliott? Oh, here he is. Now don't get fresh, Elliott. Chuck. Hey, what's up, College? It's good to see you, man. - Good to see you too. - Yeah, man. Is he in there? Yep, for awhile now. He came out three times, but he went right back in the bathroom. Man, he's got the shakes real bad. Huh, probably was out all night. Sure looks like it. Hi, hi, I'm Veronica. We're at Magnolia. Hi, I'm, hi, I'm Veronica. The hell's the elk doing over there? - Elkington's the new sponsor. - Who are these, who are they? We gotta do something about those cavalier kitties. I'm telling you. Relax, just... Relax. Big Dick. Remember to say Mak's... - I got it, I got it. - Used Car Ranch. I got it. I love the billboard. Yeah, they did a good job. It looks a lot like you. Well, not as flattering as I like to see, but it's there. Good morning. Friends, colleagues, mascots. I stand before you today a broken man. This fine establishment has been in the St. Jon family for over 30 years, and as served as the premier dog track in the state. This Saturday, we will host what could be the final Magnolia Derby. As some of you might have heard, this place has fallen on hard times and will be repossessed before you know it. Next week, the sun may very well rise over Magnolia Park, but where will you be when it does? Will you be on Planet Earth? Okay, well thank you guys - for coming out and... - You pencil neck geek! Thank you to Mak's Used Car Ranch and the wonderful people over at Elkington's. - Coming up... - You stupid! Elkington's! You know, they didn't have a lot of time. Oh, I understand. Yeah. He's always running short of time. There's nobody here. Look at that. God bless America. Yeah! Didn't enjoy the talk, but I sure enjoyed the music. Dicky. You got a visitor. Oh, send him on in. Well, that was a beautiful speech. It's almost as beautiful as Texas, wasn't it? More or less. El Paso or San Angelo? What? Better question, what are you doing in my office? Look, when a cowboy goes out to wrangle cattle, he don't look to eat a steak after. All he wants to do is perform his God given duty. And my duty is to buy this place and demolish it. You got any extra strings? I popped one of mine. Bartholomew, out. Sorry. I'm not selling this place to you. Period, end of sentence. Over and out, no. You got nowhere to run, Dicky. It's me or the bank. The bank. Partner, you are as stubborn as a longhorn in a rubber pen. I think we're done here. It's time to mosey on. Rich, now hold on. I think you and me can look at this thing together. We both have the same idea for this place. To make it shine. Why don't we do what good old boys do? Good old boys? A bet. I win the Magnolia Derby this Saturday, I get the track. You win, you get my used car ranch. Your dogs versus mine. Your dogs. Don't worry, I got connections. Buddy of mine out West has some mighty fine pups. Hmm, and I get the car ranch? Yep. Let's make a deal. Well, all right. Finishing what our dads started. You just remember to look both ways before you cross the street. All right. Howdy. What was that all about? I got no time, I gotta go get Keith. A deal with the devil himself. Can you believe this, Keith? So cowboy Mak is trying to make a deal with Big Dick St. Jon. Sounds familiar. I had heard Mak was hard up for cash these days. Kinda desperate, don't you think? Who told you that? Just know it's true. And he's got everything riding on it, just like we do. Thanks, baby. So it sounds like you got a two for one special. A prime racetrack and a crappy car dealership. Did you shake on it? Not by choice. It's a real deal, then. Handshakes hold up in court. Like father, like son. Yeah, I've been thinking about that also. I'm not following. Oh, you never heard how Dick's dad almost lost the racetrack? No. I gotta go to the ladies room. Back in the day, before your time, the St. Jon family had a reputation as the premier horse racing facility in America. Things were really good for awhile. But as time went on and the other tracks started to come around, our admission prices went down as our renovations went up. Our initial contractor wasn't the best. We went bankrupt. Thank you. Mr. St. Jon loved Magnolia more than anything. He loved it so much, he had to make a deal with the devil. Mr. Jay Hoffstadt. Mak's dad? The deal was almost exact. Whoever wins, wins it all. Mr. St. Jon was one of the hardest working fellows I've ever known. But he had a slight drinking problem. I mean, you can't blame the guy. Look at who his son is. Long story short, Mr. Hoffstadt won the race with the horse that had no business being on the same track as the other ones. Mr. St. Jon was torn up about that. - Where's my money? - I'll be right back. He ran out to his parking lot to get another bottle of whiskey... Little did Jay Hoffstadt know, he faced the same fate as Mr. St. Jon. Oh, shit. What'd I miss? How come you never told me this, Dicky? Must've slipped my mind. I want to make sure you win this race. Do we even have dogs capable of winning this thing? Haven't raced in a couple years but I think they got some juice left in them. We could drug the other dogs. - No. - No. No, no, no, no, no, no. All right. You want to roll the dice? Look, I've been a gambler since sixth grade and I'm not gonna stop now. I got a good feeling on this one. You know, Boz was the champ. Boz? Yep. Best pup we ever had at Magnolia. The dog did have a set of horse balls on him. Oh yeah. God, just pick it up, Ron. Take the snowman. - Fine. - There's a sport. All right, you guys ready to get down to business? Well Mak, you seem like a pretty straight shooter off the golf course. You know what we can do. You know that it comes with a price. Ain't that right, Ron? Absolutely. Okay, I trust you guys. You're definitely professionals. But just so we all understand the deal. You do your part, you get my car ranch. Yeah, that's right. A dog race. Dog race? Yeah, a dog race. I'm not following you, Mak. Yeah, I don't know what you mean by that, mister. I need you fellas to help me fix a dog race at Magnolia Greyhound Park. Now, how would you guys do it? You want us to kill dogs? I'll do that no problem, sir. No, no, hell, I'm not gonna kill anything. Look, I just figured you might get some drugs and give it to the dog before the race. I really need to win the race. Drugs, I ain't got any drugs on me. Do you, Ron? I mean, I had some awhile ago, but I don't really do that anymore. What, do you think I'm a plainclothesman? Here, I think these will work. Sweet, looks like we're the ones for the job. What is this stuff? Downers, you can thank my wife for those. Incidentally, anything you guys need, just let me know. And oh, when I give you the keys to the kingdom, if you know what I mean, how do you usually keep your books? Cash only. No checks, no PayPal, no IOUs. You only want the real stuff. That's the way it's gonna be, right, Ron? Yep, I used to use the bank but I got a lot of overdraft so lost a ton of money. Seemed like a waste not to just put it in a Ziploc bag, you know? Yeah, no overdrafts for sure. I'll do the accounting back at the lot and we'll cross that bridge when we get there. - Absolutely. - Hey, Mak. Don't even think about crossing us 'cause we are a serious force to be reckoned with. Things that we've done, they are unforgivable, Mak. And we will not be seeing those pearly gates anytime soon. Do you get what I'm saying, Mak? - Oh, oh, yeah. - Yeah. You'll be sleeping with the fishes. Dammit Ron, will you stop with those movie references? What am I supposed to say? Guys, I know better than to try to cross you. I believe this is a beginning of a beautiful partnership. Agreed. All right, play on. I'm giving you a mulligan. Well hold up, I'm first. - All right. - Oh yeah. You gotta let me go as well. But you're handicapped right now. Don't worry about it, just concentrate on this. Uh-oh. Nope. All right, I can't win them all. You haven't won one yet. Sir, you Matthew Fredericks? Who? Matthew Fredericks? Matthew Fredericks right here. I'd stick to College if I was you. What do we got here? Toilet paper, light bulbs. I purchased a cornucopia of things. Looks like they even sent things I didn't order. Rusty's in one of these. Let me see that. No, we have to wait for Dicky. Dicky would fire everyone on the spot if we looked at Rusty without him. Where is Dicky? Feels like we forgot something. Weren't we here just to get the plastic cups? Hmm. Y'all come back now. Nice mandles, Grandpa. Lucky you're outta season. You hillbilly garden gnome. We're never coming back here again. Why? 'Cause if I see that elk again, I could get very ugly. Pineapples? Why do we have pineapples? Pineapples are good for the esophagus.

She'll be proud of us, man, seeing us out here. I mean, we're making it in this town, you know? We pull this off and we'll be golden. Yeah. Now, there's a couple things that I need you to pick up for us. You think you can handle that? Got it. Okay. Now remember. These are canines that we're dealing with. They've got real sharp teeth, so this ain't a petting zoo. Man, I thought we were drugging rabbits. Jesus, man, you gotta focus. I don't know who's smarter, you or the dogs. The dogs are pretty smart animals, man. We used to have one back when I was a kid, when I was little. You'd be surprised the tricks you can make them do. I remember we used to have this thing, we'd jump on the trampoline and bounce off my belly. Look, man, we're not up north anymore, okay? Those days of selling dope to has beens and scamming bowling alleys, they're long gone. I miss bowling. Ron. I'm really, really starting to question bringing you down here. Hey, what's up, guys? My name's Cap'n but y'all can call me Cap'n. Y'all know what I did today? Man, I went fishing, man, with the tinsel. You ever been fishing? - I've been fishing. - Man, I'm talking about some big fish, man. You know where the tinsel is? - I don't... - Man, that fish was so big. Man, I mean big that I had to fight the alligator just to keep it off my fish, man. And I mean outta nowhere, guess what? What did the fish say when it hit the concrete wall? Damn! I mean, outta nowhere, there's the game warden, man. Did you know you have to have a fishing license to fish? - Come on, man. - I mean, have you ever been fishing, thing would never let go. That fish was so enormous, man. - I'm talking about it was... - Hey, hey, you know what? Take your ass outta here. Word, man. Word yourself. Don't believe that guy, man. Right in the middle of master plans. It's all right, man, let's have a drink. And this is between me and you, all right? Clowns like that come up - and mess it up, all right? - It's all right, yeah. It's gonna work out, Ron. Eyes on the prize. You know, everything you've always wanted, everything you've always dreamed about, everything you've always told me, that's gonna happen, man. And this is where it starts, all right? This is gonna work, man. So here's to us. Stick your pinky out, man, it's proper. Why are you so quiet tonight, teach? Is my playing that bad? Nah, junior, you sound fine. But there's always room for improvement and nothing to holler over it. I've been enjoying the jams and just got me started thinking and that's something I usually avoid. What are you thinking about? Seeing Magnolia today, all cleaned up, reminded me of my pop. It was an important part of this town. He loved this track. Old Rust used to be a judge in the chili cook-off, and hell, he even came after Santa Claus in the Christmas parade. Doesn't the elk guy do it now? That monster has taken his place. Really chaps my ass. Where was I, oh yeah. Daddy would sit back in the stands with me and watch race after race. They never seemed to get old to him. He used to say a man could figure out the meaning of life just by doing that. Over time, I've tried to make Magnolia my own. Honestly, I don't even know what I'm doing here anymore. Well I think it's pretty cool. I was actually hoping that we'd get shut down when we lost the horses. And I don't even like dogs. I wish this was a cat track. You know, I got a lotta memories here. But since then, I've become a bitter, old drunk. I pissed all my money away and wasted a lot of time. That's not true, you haven't wasted all of your time. How's that? You've taught me everything I know. Actually, junior, I'm pretty sure you're the one who's been teaching me.

Vicky, you know I hate cats. I can't hear you. Why the hell are there three kittens in our garage? Well they were the cutest of the tomcats from the track so thought it'd be nice to have something to care about around here. Oh good Lord, I just dropped them off yesterday. Look, you got me, I got you. What more do we need, huh? You lonely, baby, hmm? You need a little more Mak time? Can never get enough Mak time. I'm keeping those kittens. No you ain't, Vick. Yes, I am. You know, this is the same as when you signed us up for that timeshare. That was 15 years ago. It just points to your crazy lady logic. Good heavens, a timeshare. You know, some people actually like to travel. Yeah, wherever you go, that's where you are. That's what I always say. You don't have to travel far to figure that one out. Listen. I've been thinking and... Well that sounds real good, but it's gotta be any night but tonight. I gotta meet Danny for drinks. He just pulled into town with my pups for the race. Mak, I want to talk to you. What you need is some girlfriends to talk to. You don't like my friends. Just, I just don't want them over here in the house. You don't like me to go out. Honey, I'm a busy man. I'm too busy for all this nonsense, Danny's waiting. You're a bigger asshole than my brother. Whoa, don't compare me to that broke loser. I keep your books too so I still don't know where your confidence comes from. Confidence? Baby, I got that in droves. Wham bam! Mak, what happened to you? Look, darling. I got a race to win. I'll be back later. And get rid of them kittens. I'll get rid of something. Come on in. Hey. Hey. I've got nothing to drink except Harvey Wallbanger and tap water. I'm fine. I'm sorry, Richard. No reason to be sorry. I should've listened to you. All those years with Mak. People make mistakes, you know, and I just, I wouldn't want someone to give up on me. You're always good in my book. And I hate to lose. Like when we ran the sack races around my horse track? Yeah, and Mom would get so pissed off because we'd come in covered in dirt. Daddy loved to see us race. And I don't think I saw him any happier. It's so weird to think about them being gone for so long. Good old days. You think I'm messed up? No one's perfect. Even you, big brother. This has been an incredible week. Friends, new and old, came down to repeat the history of the track. None of them came for me. They were there for Magnolia. That name means a lot to some people. I can't believe it took me this long to realize. You're gonna win that bet tomorrow. Mak told you? Let's talk after the race. You're a good man, Richard. Even for being as hardheaded as you are. Just remember, we're not getting any younger. Thanks, Vick. Try and get some rest. Goodnight. What's on fire? I can't sleep. What's the plan? One drink. Then I'd like to go see a band at Judge Mike Florence's place. Fine. One drink. I've tried to start my own trivia game. What happened? Ah, the questions were too hard for the common man. Failed investment 78, 89? Ah, I lost count after awhile. You remember any of these questions? Yeah. How many bones are in a giraffe's neck? Seven. Lucky guess. Give me another one. What male animal becomes pregnant rather than the female? Seahorse. That year in junior college sure paid off for you. I'm a wealth of useless information. Hey man, that's not useless information. I'm just glad to see you and Rusty 2 are finally bonding. Rusty keeps me focused. Although I'm not focused on anything right now. Especially that guy butchering that classical tune. Why don't I get up there and play a face melting solo? And hey. A dog track, College. Magnolia Greyhound Racing. I think we have a shot tomorrow. Never give up. We might, we might want to watch the drinking though. I'm starting to feel it. Man, this is my creative process. Well you know what that calls for. Rusty knows what it calls for. What does it call for? I'm throwing it out there. I'm reeling it in, let me get that answer. - I know what it calls for. - Tell me. - Tequila. - Tequila. Another shot over here for this guy. We pull this off, Ron, and we'll be running this town. Then we can finally put everything that happened to us up north behind us. Yeah, in the rear view mirror. What is this stuff? We ain't going duck hunting in downtown Detroit. You gotta be kidding me, Ron. It's for the dogs. Dogs, what is this? The dogs, man, we ain't playing with them, man. You can't be doing this right now, Ron. It's so we can lure them out so it'll be easier so we can dope them up. No. The dogs are in cages. There ain't gonna be no luring of any sort out here tonight. Ron, you are off to a terrible start tonight, I can tell you that much. Now let's see that map. Wow, this is great, man. This is some of your finest work ever, Ron. Thanks. - Right, let's get started. - All right. - This is for you. - Yep. You gotta be kidding me. It's gonna work, man. Dogs love them. We'll find out. Hey, why didn't you tell me the lock was unlocked? I didn't know either. Probably crap all over the place, man. Gotta watch your step, man. What the, oh jeez. You were saying? Not funny, man. Man, these pups are loud. Hope our cover ain't blown. Think we should kill this mission? Hey buddy, there you go, there you go. All right. It's not often you surprise me, but every dog's got its day, I suppose. Saved the day. Well, we're not out of the pen yet, man, but nice job. I did not expect that maneuver. Thanks, Oren. Get your head in there and get to work, let's go. Hey, whoa, both of us, both. - Drugs. - Yeah. All right. Who likes peanut butter? You like peanut butter. Come on, man, you ain't having a coffee, man. - Let's get going. - He's really cute. That band up there is terrible. They're just butchering all those classic tunes. They should be outlawed. You think you could do better? I don't think so, son, I know. Hey. You don't have to convince me. I believe you. Let me just show you. Wait, Dicky. You don't have to show me, it's fine. I believe you. What's up, Dicky? Hey, what the hell? What the hell? - Dicky. - Enough, enough. Come on, enough, enough. I'm just trying to give you an honest performance for once. Get outta here, Dicky. Dicky. You okay? Yeah, I'm fine. Okay. What are you looking at, you geriatric marshmallow? Give me that. Oh no. I'm telling you, Rusty. I'm sick of this stupid elk. I'm sorry I'm drinking a little bit. But when I get to the elk, it's gonna be between me and him, and mostly me. Oh, wow. Welcome to Elkington's. Who's laughing now, you tick infested maggot brain? Who's laughing now? - Dicky, relax. - Get off me, man. Are you okay, Dicky? What the hell do you think you're doing? I think that woman's - calling the police. - There's a crazy man. - Definitely calling the cops. - And he's hurt bad. That guard's really standing out too. We gotta get outta here, fast. How do we do that? I'm starving. Solid night of drinking can do that to any man. Normally, I like to scope out the talent. Make a lap round here. But looks like we're the only fools here at this hour. I gotta pick up a couple personal items. - Hey, man. - Hey. What is all that stuff? I got stuff for us to celebrate, man. Man, you're gonna die of a heart attack. I covered all the food groups. Oh yeah, where's the carrot? In the cake. - Hey. - Hey. What the hell are you guys wearing? We were just on a caper. Ain't that right, boss? Looks like you've been elk hunting. This is very efficient. It's non-reflective so we can hide behind buildings. Man, I told you we'd look ridiculous in this stuff. It's urban camouflage, man. He gets it. Hey, hold up, man. Gotta get some more stuff. All right. Yep, do it. Hey, you gotta think for the both of us, man. Put it by my left boob. There you go, all right. - Got it? - Yep. Man, you gotta be thinking about bananas, spinach, apples, that's the stuff. Banana bread. Oh, we could get applesauce and pork chops. - That sounds good, man. - Yep. And some framboise. Son of a bitch. Do not move, sir, stop right now. Stop the cart, back away from the cart. Hey, don't you throw that at me, sir. You just added another charge. Don't touch those Ding Dongs. Do not touch the Ding Dongs, sir. Get your hands off the, told you, hands off the Ding Dongs. You're gonna add charges all night, aren't you? That's it. You, sir, are under arrest for assault. On an elk? He started it. Find that hard to believe, sir, considering he is an elk. And for your information, his name is Elliott. Get over here. You have the right to remain silent. I know the drill, bacon boy. Look at this mess you've made. You're nothing but a bacon boy. Speaking of bacon, sir, do you know what they do to elk abusers in the can? Dick, I'll have you out soon. Let's get Rusty to the track. Not today, sir. Son, see that blue and white over there? I'm an undercover cop. I've got proof, it's in my pocket. Check my pocket. You can tell that to the judge, sir. I know people in City Hall. - I know people in City Hall! - Say bye. Sorry to interrupt. Did you or did you not assault Elliott the Elk at Elkington's two hours ago? After he sexually assaulted me and my son, yes. That is a load of horse shit and you know it. You weren't even there, pig! Say pig one more time. - Say it one more time. - Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa. - I swear to God. - Thank you, sir. Thank you, sir, we'll be back in a few minutes. Copinsky! Yes, ma'am. So tell me again what happened. A woman called and said that he just attacked Elliott in cold blood. I hate that damn thing. I mean, why would you want an elk as your mascot? Well, Native Americans associated the elk with bravery and endurance, masculinity. Besides that, I'm not sure. Right, did you watch the surveillance video? Didn't have any outside the place. - Damn. - I know. It's the 21st century. You think a place like that would upgrade a little. So there's no evidence. What do you mean? A mascot got messed up a little but who really cares? I don't. Are you serious? That man is a lunatic and should be locked up. He attacked a defenseless elk. All right, then he comes at me two times, right? With a rabbit and then with a stack of Ding Dongs, for God's sakes. I finally get him into my car, and he starts talking about all the recipes he's gonna cook when he gets home with bacon and pork. Mm-hmm, you get it? Right, making all the pig noises and everything. If I gotta hear that pork the pig crap one more time, I swear to God. I'm gonna be off my shift in five minutes. I'm going to the derby today. Ain't no way I'm missing that derby. - Not for this. - Yeah. Man talked about cooking pig. Bacon. I like bacon. But don't like pig noises. Mm-mm. Free to go, sir. What? Are you crazy? It's about time. What did you just say to me, Copinsky? I have never seen an officer treat a sergeant like that. You're free to go, sir. Over and out. Come on, come on. We gotta get outta here, let's go. I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming. Well, at least you dropped him like a man. Yeah, I figured that majestic creature could take a punch. Me too. I'll take full responsibility for hitting that elk. But Rusty went after that cop. I couldn't hold him back. Savage. I would've been out of jail much earlier but I'm not gonna apologize to something I did not do. - I did not do anything. - Of course. Of course, you didn't do anything. You know, I've always admired how you've stuck to your guns. Well, I did punch that goofy eyed elk. You were just at the wrong place at the wrong time. It happens. Guess you're gonna have to find another place to shop. Now, get onto the track. Hey, let's hit it. Let me get two beers. You know you smell like you spent the night in jail. I've never been late to a gig in my life. Isn't this your first gig? Son, it's your fault that I got that drunk. You woke me up! Nah. Dicky, come on, we get out there. We gotta go. ♪ Time to moving ♪ ♪ Time to grooving ♪ ♪ Time to be with you ♪ ♪ No more moaning ♪ ♪ No more groaning ♪ ♪ We can leave this mess ♪ ♪ I went down to get drunk ♪ ♪ Waking up to see ♪ ♪ Come back, baby ♪ Who had this? ♪ Time to set you free ♪ ♪ I'm so glad ♪ ♪ I'm so glad ♪ ♪ I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad ♪ ♪ I'm so glad ♪ ♪ I'm so glad ♪ ♪ I'm glad, I'm glad, I'm glad ♪ So, what are you thinking about for encore? That's your call. That's your band out there. You don't need me around anymore. What are you talking about? I can't go back out there without you. Nah, son, it works for the best. That's your band, that's your show, and that's your stage. But isn't this what you've always wanted? Not here. I can't stand this place. I got a yearning for the freedom of an open road. You'll understand as you get a little older. I don't want you to go. It's for the best, son. Where are you gonna go? Anywhere but here. Gentlemen, thank you for coming. Wow, this is our spot? That's a nice table right at the finish line. This is the start of something really special. I like the sound of that. So all went as planned. It was a slam dunk. Good. Looks like I'm finally gonna be king of this town. Well, how about something to wet our whistles? What'll it be, boys? I'll take any drink with an umbrella in it. A couple shooters. - Vodka. - Cotton candy. All right, that's the concession stand but for y'all, anything. Back in a jiff. Thanks. Hey, Ron. Look at this turnout. We might be in for a bigger payday than we thought. Job well done. Great job. You okay? Yeah but help me up and get me to my office. Bartholomew, go out there and make me proud. Okay. You don't want to watch the biggest race of your life? Tell you the truth, I'd rather watch it alone in my office. I'm exhausted. You had a pretty big week. This place. I'm getting outta here. Hell, I don't know what I was ever doing in here. I'm retiring. Hell of a time to tell me. If we win tonight, Vicky's gonna need a lot of help. What do you mean? While I was wasted, sitting in the slammer, I saw the whole thing. I saw the whole kit and caboodle. You sure you're not still drunk? Sober as Sally. Well. Before you leave, you should, you should probably take a shower. Our final race of the evening will be the 27th running of the Magnolia Derby. Here are the entrants for the finalists. Number one. A black and white greyhound weighing in at 57 pounds. Number two, Brian Bosworth. Brown greyhound weighing at 74 pounds. This is it, man. 3467, super trifecta box. I'll be back in a big way. Red greyhound weighing 71 pounds. Number six, Sadie's Lucky Charm. Black and white greyhound weighing at 62 pounds. Number seven, CTK Velocity. Brown greyhound weighing 61 pounds. And finally, the number eight. CK's Smoking Gun. The brown greyhound weighing 67 pounds. That should do it for the 27th Magnolia Derby. It's two minutes until post. Give me 500 on Rusty to win. That bastard ain't never lost a race. Two minutes until post. ♪ Let love be my crime ♪ ♪ You want to bring me a long way ♪ ♪ Heartbreaker ♪ ♪ Fat back, Cadillac love maker here ♪ No. I'd say good luck, Mak, but I think your luck has finally run out. Who was that fox? I don't know, but it looks like somebody's getting laid tonight. Wait a minute, that was my wife. What the hell did she mean by that? She thinks you're gonna lose. You better hope she's wrong, cowboy. Oh boy, go figure. I gotta say, College, you've done a tremendous job. This place looks better than ever. Thanks, Vicky. You know how much you guys mean to me. What numbers do we got? One, two, five, and eight. Boz is number two, that's all you need to know. And Rusty's on the move. Look at Rusty. Here comes Rusty. And the greyhounds are out of the box. It's the one breaking to an early lead. Followed by the two, Brian Bosworth, and of course, Satan's Valentine. Go, number three, you gotta dig down deep! And here they go around the first turn now. Around the first turn, into the back stretch. What's going on, Mak? Those first two dogs, man, they ain't ours. He'll come around, here he comes. It's the two, Brian Bosworth, going ahead. And it's the five with the lead. But the two making a move, coming down to the wire. Oh dear. Come on, Boz. It's the two for the end! It's 2356, Brian Bosworth once again! You gotta be kidding, man! What the fuck! Well, Mak, looks like we are gonna have to take a ride. Oh, come on, guys. This ain't the time for excuses. Hold on a minute here. You just cost us everything. Cost you, oh. Thanks for helping out with the track, Mak. I told you it was for a good cause. Why, you dirty double crosser. Wait a minute, darling, I had nothing to do with it. It's these devils here. They're the ones you got a problem with. Turn me loose here. Congratulations. Guess we got lucky. Well actually, luck had nothing to do with it. I finally got to beat Mak at his own game. How? He was gonna drug your dogs so I switched out the pills. Guess he underestimated you. Yeah, I'm not exactly a halfwit, am I? I'm gonna miss you, Vicky. I'm gonna miss you. I've had my turn as being captain of this leaky ship. Magnolia Park, it was destined to be yours. Should've been yours 20 years ago. Thank you. I'm gonna miss you, big brother. I'll call you when I get settled. Where are you gonna go? Where the music takes me. Feels good out. Think I'll leave it out. A and five, right? It's five alpha, take one. Five alpha, call that 5A, 5A. Staff and patrons, go home. The reasons have yet to be determined. I'll tell you, I can see a white ass on a white rock on a white night. 5A, get that, there you go, and mark it. Beautiful, keep the pen, don't throw it out. You gotta help us, Bruce. Bruce, you gotta help us. We only weigh a little. I'm slipping. Pineapples, why do we have pineapples? 'Cause we have dentists. That's the way it's supposed to be. Second set, 42 charlie, take one, second set. You should probably take a shower. With who, Brett? Oh no. You're actually shopping. I think this is the beginning of a beautiful partnership. Agreed. That's my car, someone's trying to break into it. But I don't care, there's nothing of value in there. Let's go, you're up. Listen, here's my plan. Oh, sorry. Well, God almighty, it was a pretty good plan if you just give it a minute. Be right with you. This big cat has nine lives, and on my count... Guess I'll just stand here like a schmuck. Just forever. Like a real tool. This is the most dangerous hole on the course. Yeah, ain't it ever. I've seen men knocked over by a ball. Well, you ain't gonna see this man knocked over. Like I said, man, stand back. Cut, they've put socks. They've got socks. I'm coming, oh jeez. The nuclear power plant. The reason the tires tug. Okay, that's a cut, that's a cut. Oh jeez. Put on, put on, put on, put on. Milk. Cheese frog, cheese frog, cheese frogs. Put on, put on, put on. Milk. You hear me? Cut. Hey, we're almost there. Go home. Have a nice day, all you...
