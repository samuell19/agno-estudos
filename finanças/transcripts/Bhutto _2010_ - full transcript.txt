A people rejoice. Independence for India and Pakistan. Newscaster 4: When the British begin their departure, an era ends, and a new era begins. Newscaster 5: As the new dominions of Pakistan and India take over their own affairs, millions began a journey that over the months was to become the greatest mass migration in history. Newscaster 6: The country was born in confusion. Woman: People who thought they were in Pakistan suddenly realized that they actually were in India.

Newscaster 12: But English is the official language. Newscaster 13: Used in business, government, and legal contracts. Newscaster 14: It is the Moslem faith which holds the nation together. Newscaster 15: Tension between Hindus and Muslims of India always ran high. Newscaster 16: When India and Pakistan won their independence... Newscaster 17: The partition led almost immediately to disputes. Newscaster 18: Pakistan's very existence depended largely on adequate military strength should the dispute with India assume uncontrollable proportions. Newscaster 19: The borderland Kashmir has been a disputed territory ever since. Newscaster 20: The U.N. succeeds in obtaining a cease-fire. Newscaster 21: Pakistan has never managed to get control of all of Kashmir. Bush: We're making it very clear to both Pakistan and India that war will not serve their interests.

Be means "without." Nazir is like, I guess vision or com-comparison. Basically, it means unique, one of a kind, and, boy, did she turn out that way. ♪ Bhutto was the quintessential charismatic personality. He was young, educated. Zulfikar Bhutto was really a man of the world. He went to USC, and then he transferred to Berkeley, and then he went on to Oxford. And he wanted to be taken seriously on the global stage. ♪ I think Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, what he had that made him so special was incredible eloquence, great belief in himself, and then a serious ability to do backroom deals. ♪ ♪ Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was courting my aunt, Nusrat. ♪ The minute my father saw my mother, who was so absolutely gorgeous, I think he flipped, and was love at first sight. Nusrat was not only a wife, but a close partner of Mr. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto. She advised him extensively. She was Iranian, and she was more modern than the average Pakistani woman. She famously drove a car when Muslim women were not driving cars at all. Ispahani: The social consciousness of both parents was so powerful that it influenced all the children, not only Benazir, but Shahnawaz, Sanam, and Murtaza. It was like they were going to leave a legacy behind them so that the children could carry on, could carry forward. There was a reason why they were called the Kennedys of Pakistan. Wilentz: Zulfikar's father, Shah Nawaz Bhutto, profited from partition. He received from the new Pakistan a gigantic tract of land, larger than they can imagine, like Los Angeles County. Benazir: We were landowners, large landowners. My father would tell me, "Look at the way these people sweat in the heat and in the sun, in the fields. It is because of their sweat that you will have the opportunity to be educated, and you have a debt to these people. You've got to come back and pay that debt by serving your people." Wilentz: In a feudal system, everyone is beholden to the master. And this is what Zulfikar Bhutto, Benazir's father, came from and what he was trying to change so that there could be some progress in Pakistan. He saw that countries that do well economically have to have some kind of a middle class that give the people the opportunity to move upwards. For Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, education was the key for everything, not only for his own children, but for the people of Pakistan, because he knew, with education, people would be able to stand on their own feet, they'll be productive members of society. And to complete democracy. ♪ Not too long ago, I sat where you now sit, tramping to class in subarctic temperatures, fighting for books at Hilles Library, cramming for exams. ♪ Ooh, baby, baby, it's a wild world... ♪ I met her first day of freshman year at Harvard. She was 16. I was 18. She was quiet. She was studious. Uh, she made a small circle of friends, but this was 1969, and, six months of her arrival, all the dorms went coed. We were in the same dorm. She talked a lot about her own family. We have a lot in common. Benazir comes from a political family. She was very interested in politics, was interested in the world. Not only was she becoming a grown-up, but she was independent for the first time, and her life was under her control. And no one else could control it, not Mummy, not Daddy, just Benazir. ♪ Power to the people ♪ Power to the people ♪ Power to the people This was the height of the Vietnam War, and she saw firsthand the power of the people to change a policy and to bring down a government. ♪ She was very much exposed to the ideas of equal rights for women, and that was something that--that very much influenced her life. ♪ India and Pakistan, of course, have fought numerous wars. But I think none was more bitter than the war of 1971. India dismembered Pakistan. It split East and West Pakistan, East Pakistan becoming Bangladesh. The loss was a humiliation to Pakistan. Not only had their geography changed, but their national sense of self was changed. It was great drama for the U.N. in its relatively young, young phase. Siegel: The U.N. was not going to intervene on the side of Pakistan. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto made it very clear that Pakistan would not surrender. He didn't come to New York to surrender. That propelled him into a very strong national figure. ♪ [crowd chanting] Bhutto could rally the masses, mesmerize the masses. [speaking in dialect] ♪ ♪ Bhutto just swept the polls. People were waiting for change. ♪ People who chanted "The meaning of Pakistan is food, clothing, and shelter" won the elections with massive majority. ♪ He moved rapidly to make peace with India. Certainly his greatest diplomatic triumph was the Simla Accords. I met Mrs. Gandhi in 1972 when I accompanied my father to Simla. I was wearing my first sari, and I was very concerned that I might trip over the sari and it would come undone in front of all the international photographers. ♪ This was a negotiation in which he didn't have very many cards. After all, India was the victorious power. But using his diplomatic skills, he got a reasonably good bargain which allowed for the return of some 95,000 Pakistani prisoners of war, reestablished normal relations between the two countries. This was very much a formative experience for Benazir. She watched her father operate. She had a diplomatic role as his hostess, and she absorbed many of his lessons of diplomacy. My father always said, "My daughter will make me more proud than Indira made her father." So my father always had the idea that I was a chip off the block. ♪ We met when we were both in India, and I was at Cambridge. She was at Oxford. I was struck from the first moment I met her by her force of life. Harvard was a place where she could really be herself. She wasn't in the limelight. At Oxford, there was a large Pakistani community. She was older, and I think she was thinking about her future career. Schofield: It was assumed that she would not go into politics. She did an interview shortly as she was to leave Oxford. The headline was, "No Politics for the President's Daughter," but at the same time, she had her eye on what was going on in--in Pakistan. ♪ In 1974, India detonated a nuclear explosion, and so now Pakistan faced an India that was eight times the size and which had nuclear weapons. Once India got the Bomb, the Pakistani military started clamoring and telling Bhutto, "We want nuclear weapons. Otherwise, how can we compete with the Indians?" Bhutto made this famous speech. "We will build the nuclear bomb," he announced in public, "even if we have to eat grass for 1,000 years." Dr. Kissinger actually was a friend of my father's and respected him greatly, and he tried to warn him as a friend. So he said, "I don't want you to be made a horrible example of, and so you should not develop the nuclear device." Sanam: The whole of the West was very, very anti-Pakistan, because they thought we were doing an injustice. It was a bad situation. Like all great charismatic leaders, Bhutto had flaws. He had great strengths, but great weaknesses, and very soon he was in trouble with the establishment, with even the people of Pakistan. Schofield: Her father had chosen to call elections. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto was reelected. They were contested, and a massive agitation started in Pakistan. He panicked. So he thought he would outflank them by pushing through reforms or demands that they wanted. He made Friday the national holiday and not Sunday. He banned alcohol in the country. I'm not arrogant. I, uh, would hate to be arrogant or to consider myself to be arrogant, but certainly I am intolerant of certain stupid things. When you have power and there's only you, when you think you're more intelligent than the rest of the country, that's always a mistake. ♪ Ali: He frog-leaped Zia over the heads of five other generals. Zia was, on the face of it, very humble. That's the phrase often he used, "I am your humble servant." And Bhutto was taken in by this show of deference. And then what had to happen happened. ♪ Ali: General Zia-ul-Haq seized power in April, 1977. Basically, there was a general election. Bhutto would have won that election, but his overzealous supporters in the state apparatus rigged that election, which created the atmosphere which permitted the military to come back in. With the green light given by the U.S., Henry Kissinger had said to Bhutto, "We will make a horrible example out of you." ♪ The charges that were brought against Zulfikar were never proven. They were not warranted, and so this was basically to get rid of him. And then after that, the troubles began for the family. Sanam: I was in my third year in university. My brothers had to go back to school. My mother and my father said even if they try and take you off the plane, if they do whatever, don't, under any circumstances, come out of the airplane. Just stay there, and go and finish your education. He was concerned particularly for the boys, for their safety. I never knew what was happening to my family. I never knew what was happening to my father. My brother was in Oxford, so I used to go and try and visit him. They didn't have that proximity over that last one year which Benazir had with her father. Week after week, she'd go to jail to see him, and it was during that period she had these very intense conversations with him about leadership and about the people. Once her father was toppled and in prison, she now became very engaged, very active. So here we had overnight another charismatic Bhutto. Siegel: He gave her the mantle of the party, and in a normal Islamic Society, they would give it to the eldest son. But Zulfikar Ali Bhutto gave it to the eldest child, the one he thought could best do the job, and it was a woman. ♪ Schofield: It was a huge, ongoing struggle for the clearing of her father's name. Then things went from bad to worse. ♪ Mir went around the world to lobby leaders to try and save Zulfikar from the executioner's noose. Our message to General Zia is that release my father and hold free election, and let the people decide the fate of the country. We have come out against the military regime headed by General Zia-ul-Haq, which we feel is acting in a manner which is prejudicial. We were so isolated, and I just used to pretend that it's not gonna happen. Zia knew, as long as Zulfikar is alive, Zia can never stay president of the country. ♪ All: Father, very intelligent, Coriolanus in Shakespeare, finally falls out with his own supporters, weakens, and his enemies pounce on him. The whole story of the Bhuttos has strong elements of a Greek tragedy. ♪ My father was very calm, and he talked of family matters. He talked about Mother, and I keep seeing his face. ♪ I said that I'd like to hug my father good-bye. He'd been the president, the prime minister. He'd brought them back from the camps of India. They wouldn't even open the cell doors for me to kiss him good-bye. ♪ He said, "This is good-bye until the final meeting." And those were his last words he spoke to either my mother or myself. ♪ What do you say? ♪ Ali: Zia's rule proved to be the worst period in Pakistan's history. A fear enveloped the country, and many people said, "If they can hang Bhutto, who the hell are we?" I don't know. After my father's death, I came back to Pakistan, and the whole atmosphere changed. I mean, they kept hauling my mother and sister off to different jails. Everything was under martial order. I mean they had a martial order that our last name wasn't allowed to be in the newspapers. Zia did not want any activity from the family. So if the brothers are outside the country and the wife and the daughter is in prison, no activity. Galbraith: Zia was an Islamist. He began a process of Islamicizing Pakistan. General Zia said, "We are the true defenders. Israel without Judaism would collapse. Pakistan without Islam would collapse." He imposed Sharia law. Sharia is a divine, utopian, heavenly code of conduct. Sharia on Earth means whatever the leader says Sharia means. But of course the area in which they had the most devastation was in women's rights. What's often referred to as the Hudood laws. The punishment for these crimes is actually mandated by the Qur'an. There was this notorious law under which, if a woman was raped, she had to produce four male witnesses to the penetration. If she couldn't produce that, then she would go to jail for sex outside marriage, which was illegal. Ali: Public hangings, public floggings. Harsh though they may seem to us, all those punishments are perfectly acceptable under Islamic law. People are not allowed to travel. People are not allowed to voice their own opinions. I believe in freedom of thought, freedom of expression. People are not allowed to voice their ideas. They're not allowed to do anything at all. It is freedom with responsibility, not freedom for the sake of freedom or free--or free for all. What I am sitting and doing right now in this drawing room is a crime under martial law regulation. Then he had this extraordinary break in his favor. ♪ The Soviets invaded Afghanistan. Pakistan was important from the very beginning for strategic reasons. You only have to look at a map. Galbraith: I think the administration thought that the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan was a major threat to the United States, that the Soviet Union would dominate the northern part of the Persian Gulf, it would threaten Western oil supplies, and the communists would have scored a major victory. Ali: The main task defeat the Russians whatever the cost. And that made this squalid dictator into a plucky fighter for freedom. Brzezinski actually went to the Afghan border. If that land over there is yours, you'll go back to it one day, because your fight will prevail. And you'll have your homes and your mosques back again, because your cause is right, and God is on your side. Ali: A lot of these religious primers, which were teaching kids in the madrasas, in all the jihadi rhetoric, kaf,the letter K. Kafis for Kalashnikov. All these textbooks were specially printed by the University of Nebraska. ♪ Reagan introduced these guys to the press corps once and said, "These are the equivalents of our founding fathers." And some of us watching at the time was sort of joking. "Which one is Washington? Which one is Jefferson? You know, where's Benjamin Franklin among them?" The two boys, Murtaza and Shahnawaz, were very disillusioned, and they went to Afghanistan. ♪ Shahnawaz was the youngest of the four kids. They all adored him so much, such a nice, kind kid. Siegel: He was-- he was always smiling. Benazir always talked about him being incredibly handsome and a great charmer. He wasn't as intense and serious as Murtaza was. ♪ Wilentz: Mir had the arrogance of the men of the family. He needed to feel he was doing something, so there was a lot of sort of talk. They were trying to build a group from outside the country to overthrow the government of Zia. ♪ There's been a dramatic development in the Damascus hijack today. As the Pakistan government has been claiming that the man behind the hijacking is the eldest son of Pakistan's former president, Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Murtaza vowed to avenge their father's death. The hijacking of the P.I.A. liner took place. Then it had become very, very difficult. Has Murtaza crossed the line between political activity in exile and terrorism? The Pakistan government says he has. Benazir's brothers were branded as terrorists. In the end, the Pakistan government capitulated to the hijackers, agreeing to swap the political prisoners for the hostages aboard the P.I.A. plane. Galbraith: Benazir was tarred with connection to those terrorist brothers. Zia threw her into a class-C cell in the desert of Sindh. Class C are the--the lowest quality cells that there are. She had not talked to anyone for several years. When I went to visit her, she could not talk. She would write on a piece of paper whatever she wanted to tell me, because her jaws had locked. She had some ear complaint, and they called a doctor. They said you're not well, and we're going to give you medicine, but the medicine they were giving her, I think, were tranquilizers, 'cause my mother noticed she was becoming like a zombie. I think his basic thought was that he could kill her. ♪ By the time the Afghan war was in full swing, Zia knew that the U.S. couldn't do without him. Galbraith: The Reagan administration simply let the Pakistani dictator decide how billions of U.S. dollars would be used to fight the Soviets, and Zia gave them to the most extreme Islamic groups. That is the period when Pakistan's Inter-Services Intelligence, I.S.I., became a powerful, octopus-like agency with a finger in every sphere of public life in the country, massive spying operators, massive budget. ♪ The I.S.I. is the NSA, the CIA, and the Pentagon all rolled into a single body. It is in some sense a shadow military force. The I.S.I. would use enormous funds to actually create organizations which they armed and then used in Afghanistan. The mujahideenis the term that we use to describe the diverse groups of militants and fighters, some Afghan, but many from outside of Afghanistan, fighters all over the world who gathered to repel the Soviet invasion. Coll: Osama bin Laden was a part of that movement. He was a particularly well resourced and effective militia leader. We thought that defeating the Soviet Union was so important that we didn't care that we were actually supporting Osama bin Laden and people who were his allies. As far as Pakistan was concerned, it destroyed the social fabric of that country, 'cause you had armed groups backed by the military regime running wild in the country. ♪ Another of the sort of numerous ironies, the Americans got rid of Bhutto because of the nuclear bomb. Then General Zia, their man, is in power and uses the fact that he's become absolutely necessary for the United States to fight the war in Afghanistan to basically build the Bomb. And that is what he did. I say that it is the right of any developing country to acquire the modern technology, and amongst the modern technology is a nuclear technology. Nuclear technology for peaceful purposes. The notion that American military intelligence didn't know about it is just nonsense. They knew what was going on very well. It was a price they were prepared to pay. ♪ In December of 1982, General Zia came to Washington. And as part of his visit, he had a lunch with the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The only a senator who was on time was Pell, his biggest critic. In the very first question, Pell handed him the letter about political prisoners. Benazir was the first name on the list, and he raised Benazir's case, described her--her conditions of imprisonment. Zia responded by saying, "Oh, no, that's not right, Senator. She's now under house arrest, and she lives in a more comfortable house than any of your senators." ♪ You know, our family home in Larkana, they declared it's a subjail, so it wasn't like you could come and go as you wish. So I was always going to home secretary's office and this one's office and that one's office, begging can I go and see them. Siegel: She was released from prison only because she was in terrible physical shape. She was in danger of dying, and that's why Zia-ul-Haq let her out. I take it he didn't want to be held countable for more Bhutto blood. And she went to London. I went to the airport, and there was a sea of people. I asked her this afternoon if, in the eyes of President Zia, she was now conveniently out of the way. We have not left Pakistan. We have not come out as political refugees or sought political asylum. We are Pakistanis, and we'll go back to Pakistan. That's our homeland, that's where we live, and that's where we'll die. Schofield: She had to restore her health in terms of leading a, you know, more measured life. And there were some happy times for her. ♪ The Bhutto family would go to the south of France on holiday. Yeah, they were all there, the two brothers. Their wives were there. Nusrat was there. Benazir was there. Sanam was there. And they had met that evening, or that--that dinner they had had together, and late the next morning, they find Shahnawaz dead. ♪ Apparently somebody had poisoned him. He died in great pain over several hours, with her sister-in-law doing nothing to come to his aid. It was a horrible experience for the family. Without a shadow of doubt, I feel that he was most cruelly, heartlessly murdered. Well, we would like the French police to find out, but we think it took place within a political context. Schofield: Going back with his body, she saw the love and the devotion of the people. And she realized from that moment onward, she had to set in motion the next phase of her life, which was going back to resume an active career in politics. My father had a vision of Pakistan as a democratic and progressive nation. My family is committed to his vision of Pakistan. We don't fear anything. I said to her, "You need to come to the United States, persuade Americans that you're not a dangerous radical." She had a charm offensive. ♪ Ambassador Peter Galbraith asked if we would have a small dinner party for a friend of his who they--who was just getting out of prison. And I said, "Oh, that's intriguing." That was really the first time I met her. Galbraith: He had a-- a sort of Washington salon, some members of Congress, a whole bunch of journalist friends, and she charmed everybody. ♪ Siegel: She was speaking quietly. Everyone would sort of lean forward, because she was enrapturing. ♪ She would say what she thought, and people would come out of meetings with her saying, "My God, I-I can't believe that she said that." But it served her well, because people began to trust her. Nawaz: She also used her contacts in the Arab world, Libya for instance. She had this ability to live in both worlds. Siegel: There was a groundswell of support that was building against the dictatorship. What was left of the civil society, what was left of the NGOs, all were banding together, demanding a reform. ♪ Until the beginning of this year, Genera Zia outlawed all political opposition in Pakistan, but now, in a new political climate, the way may soon be clear to challenge him in an election. If that proves the case, then leading that challenge will be Benazir Bhutto. ♪ She wasn't intimidated by generals, by dictators. She really thought she was on a holy mission to bring democracy back to the country. ♪ In Pakistan, supporters of the opposition leader Benazir Bhutto are gathering to welcome her back, promising to overthrow the present leader, General Zia, and to test his claim that democracy has been restored. She arrived in Pakistan, and suddenly there was a kind of electric shock that went through the body politic of the nation. [crowd chanting] And she really won the heart of millions of Pakistanis, because she was seen as this young, almost frail girl taking on this brutal military dictator with all the authority and the power and the military backing him. ♪ Ali: People who had been too scared or who hadn't felt like coming out when Bhutto was hanged came out for her. One of the banners they held up was, "Forgive us, Benazir." Forgive us for not having come out when your father was being hanged. ♪ I think she determined early on that she would never have a personal life, that she would be a political leader, but she functionally wouldn't be a woman, she would never marry, she would never have children. But she came to realize that for her to function in a man's political environment in Pakistan, meetings with men, evenings alone, it was very important for her to be married, so, in 1987, a marriage was arranged. ♪ Asif Ali Zardari was a man of considerable personal charm. ♪ ♪ Hard to understand but a hell of a man ♪ She came to London, and we met, and I said, "Well, what's he like?" And she said, "He's the only one who wanted to marry me." ♪ She was the last person in the world that we thought would be part of an arranged marriage. She was like one of the most independent people that we've ever met. Wilentz: She was moving toward a position of power in Pakistan. She couldn't very well be seen gallivanting with Western men. The initial engagement was in my apartment in London. She was alone so much, and she'd been through jail, and I thought she needed pampering, and she deserved a break, basically. I remember her saying to me, "My mother picked him, but I fell in love with him as though I had met him across a crowded room." ♪ It was incredibly colorful, almost like something out of Arabian Nights. It was a great time. All my family were there. My mother was thrilled that my sister was getting married. I think she was the happiest person in Pakistan. ♪ [speaking in dialect] ♪ My party does not want bloodshed. My party does not want violence, and we again repeat it, that hear the call of the people, and give us a date for immediate election. Benazir Bhutto today challenged you before leaving Karachi to an election showdown. Could you please give us your reaction? [chatter] Sanam: She was expecting, and Zia thought, "Now she's married, and she can't do it." He didn't know that my sister's a very determined person. I traveled with her a lot during the elections, and--and she was pregnant, you know, during some of the campaign. And she cleverly had fooled General Zia, because she knew they would get her medical records and find out when the baby was due and time the election exactly for that so she wouldn't be able to campaign, so she got her records switched. Siegel: I visited Pakistan with part of-- group of democratic party officials. I met with General Zia. He looked at me, and he said, "The worst mistake of my life was allowing your friend to live." And I related this story to Benazir, and she looked at me without any expression, and she said, "He's right." ♪ Newscaster: President Zia was onboard a C-130 transport plane heading from Bahawalpur to Lahore. Shortly after takeoff, his plane exploded, killing the president and all those aboard. Burns: The death of Zia-ul-Haq, which has never been explained, box of mangoes that exploded on his C-130 Hercules and killed the American Ambassador to Pakistan, the president of Pakistan, Zia-ul-Haq, the chief military attaché of the U.S. embassy. And out of this came pressure for democratic government. [cheering] ♪ The elections were November, '89, and she had the baby in September. ♪ ♪ [shouting, cheering] Newscaster: They danced in the streets as the final returns came in, returns that gave Benazir Bhutto's Pakistan Peoples Party a nearly two-to-one majority over any other political group. People of Pakistan have elected the Pakistan Peoples Party with the largest single majority in the entire country. ♪ Even my own husband thought I was under delusions that I could beat a military dictator, and he thought that, "When she wakes up and finds out that it's all wrong and she can't, then I'll be there to console her," little knowing that I was the one who had to console him when I won. [singing in dialect] ♪ At a very young age, 35, Benazir Bhutto became not just the youngest prime minister of a Muslim majority state. More importantly, she became the first woman. ♪ On the first day in office, she freed all political prisoners. She made the media free of censorship. She allowed for student unions. It was a fundamental opening up of Pakistan after a decade of repression. Ali: Tiny things improve the lives of people. She was the one who gave water, drinking water to these villages. She was the one who brought electricity. Siegel: She built 48,000 primary and secondary schools. In terms of healthcare, she ended polio in Pakistan, completely eliminated it. One thing that Benazir was very proud of was her women's police stations. It sounds like nothing, but for a woman in Pakistan, it can spell a dreadful fate to be in an all-male police station. She had great force to change not only Pakistan, but change the world and change how Islamic women viewed themselves and how Islamic men viewed Islamic women and how children viewed their mothers and how brothers viewed their sisters and how sisters viewed themselves. When I first became prime minister, I wanted to assure that a woman could be as good as a man. Mrs. Golda Meir and Mrs. Thatcher and Mrs. Indira Gandhi were all known for being strong as men, but I think it's important to be a woman, because a woman brings nurturing aspects. Bakhtawar was born when Benazir Bhutto was the seated prime minister. I remember she'd shared a cabinet meeting, uh, late in one afternoon, and she gave birth to her daughter the next morning. She believes in equality, and she treated herself like that. Like, a lot of the times, you'd come in the room and you'd see this leader, you know, this woman, and all these men following behind. And, you know, she didn't see herself as any different. Galbraith: President Bush had her as the first state visitor of his administration. Members of the Congress, I deem it a high honor and personal pleasure to present to you Her Excellency Mohtarma Benazir Bhutto, Prime Minister of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan. [applause] We set as our purpose reconciliation, not retribution. Some claimed to fear revenge, revenge against the murderers and the torturers, revenge against those who subverted constitutional law. But, ladies and gentlemen, there was no revenge. For them and for dictators across the world, democracy is the greatest revenge. [applause] Galbraith: She had the position of prime minister, but she had very little power. She learned the details of the Pakistani nuclear program from the United States. She had a plurality in the national assembly, not a majority. Second, the president was a crony of Zia-ul-Haq's and was very hostile to her. The military was very suspicious of her and completely unwilling to accept orders from a young woman. ♪ There were attempts by the I.S.I., in terms of public relations, to damage her, and one was the creation of this title for Asif of Mr. Ten Percent. This is three weeks before the election. Asif Zardari earned the nickname Mr. Ten Percent because no business transaction was done in Pakistan without his involvement. Corruption is what dogs all of these politicians. Asif's reputation, I think, was permanently damaged from this campaign. They could not, on the other hand, wish away her base of support. Then they tried to contain her influence by supporting rival politicians. ♪ Nawaz Sharif was essentially introduced into politics during the period of General Zia-ul-Haq. He was is Zia's protégé and became a player. He came onto the national scene as part of a coalition of Islamic parties that was put together by the Inter-Services Intelligence to oppose Benazir Bhutto. The PMLN controlling the Punjab was clearly trying to take over. So her entire period in power was spent fighting battles. Unsurprisingly, within 18 months of being in office, she hadn't solved all of the problems in Pakistan and was certainly vulnerable to political criticism from a lot of different quarters. Abbas: There was no plan. The entire focus was on getting Zia out and getting elected. And once she actually got there, you know, there wasn't a plan. Galbraith: Her whole focus was on the struggle for democracy, for getting rid of the dictatorship, and frankly, I don't think her party thought much about what they would do once they were in power, and anyhow, they were just barely in power. They really tied her hands in terms of what she could do. Piracha: The I.S.I. was very active. Their sole aim was to displace her. They did not want her to stay there. They didn't even want to give her a month. Lamb: She always used to say then, we were in office, not in power. Shortly after that, her government was removed by the army. ♪ Disqualification is really very meaningless. I won't be the first leader to be disqualified. So very rapidly, they removed her from power, and Nawaz Sharif came in. Abbas: Well, after 20 months in office, she was deposed, ostensibly for corruption. But that's what they say about everyone. It becomes an excuse when a government is inconvenient. I do not believe that she was personally corrupt, but I also know that the standard way to go after Pakistani politicians is to allege corruption. It was incredibly disappointing, because people had had all these hopes. It was a time of acute disappointment for Pakistanis, I think, because she didn't do very much. Piracha: I mean, we are expecting one individual, and that individual who I now think was alone, totally alone. Yes, she had this political party, but she was head and shoulders above everybody else. Maybe that was her tragedy. That was the tragedy of the Bhuttos that nobody around them could match them. ♪ The PPP under Benazir's first government became a family business. It became a Zardari-owned enterprise. Siegel: He was being held hostage to her political career, and we--we knew that from the very beginning. Her husband has consistently been demonized. It was made to seem that she was a princess, he was a playboy. Every little thing, whether it was right or wrong would just get excessive play. Siegel: They offered so many times for these trumped-up charges to be dropped if she would agree to not be in politics, and he would have no part of it. And of course, she wouldn't either, but she was so proud that he, in jail, said, "Absolutely not. No." Sacrifice really defines Benazir and Asif as individuals, and sacrifice is the word that describes their marriage. What I saw develop in that relationship was really quite, quite amazing. The Soviet occupation of Afghanistan is officially over. The Soviet defeat has been fully consummated. The last Soviet troops have gone home. The deeply scarred Afghans will now be left to shed each other's blood all on their own. One of the saddest things is that after the mujahideen dislodged the Soviet Union in Afghanistan, using Pakistan really as a transit point, the United States really kind of turned its back on Pakistan. Siegel: The U.S. was on the next bus out of town. We didn't stay to try to really reconstruct civil society, to build a democratic society. We were just gone. Musharraf: We were left alone. Warlordism started. ♪ All the mujahideen who were there, brought by us from all over the world, 20,000, 30,000 of them, they were there. They were all holed up. Four million refugees came to Pakistan. Did anyone talk of resettling them? You needed money to resettle them. Nobody's doing anything of the sort, so therefore, they coalesce and become Al-Qaeda. Galbraith: Benazir was the one talking about the danger that was posed by the Taliban and Al-Qaeda. All across Pakistan, secretly, cells have been operating, which have been trying to undergo militant training, and we don't want that, because we feel that this is a threat to Pakistan. Siegel: Benazir came on her first state visit to the United States, and she spent some time alone with Bush 41, and she told me one of the things that she said is, "Mr. President, I fear we have created a Frankenstein." Her message largely fell on deaf ears. Newscaster: She was consigned to the political wilderness, but Benazir Bhutto is back, as supporters call her conqueror of dictatorship, leader of democracy, queen of Asia. But now she faces a new enemy, her own family. The fight is over a dead man's legacy, that of Zulfikar Ali Bhutto, Benazir's father. The challengers for the title are his widow Nusrat and his eldest son, Murtaza. The defending champions, Benazir's husband Asif and Benazir herself. Burns: It wasn't just that the Bhuttos were contending with the Sharifs. It was that the Bhuttos were contending among themselves. She said, "Please don't. You will make things difficult for me." I could not forever base my politics on--on the remote possibility that it would hurt my sister's politics. There was always a tension that Zulfikar Ali Bhutto had selected his oldest child and not his oldest son. It was a family feud in a sense, two families each believing that they had the right to inherit the kingdom. ♪ Newscaster: On the 19th of October, 1993, Benazir was sworn in as the prime minister of Pakistan for the second time, her mother at her side. What is really, I think, fundamental in assessing Benazir's legacy as prime minister is how she did in her second term, when inexperience and youth were no longer the excuses. She had broader vision, and I know, this time, she'd given a lot of thought as to what she might be able to accomplish. She wrote a book that was meant to be a political manifesto. Reconciliation was to be published after she had become the prime minister. It's a mandate for freedom, for dignity, for equality, for hope, for entering the 21st century with technology and science. ♪ The woman would go out of her way, using the Qur'an to debunk the jihadist myth on women, on other religions, on tolerance, on democracy. It was such a strong denunciation of the jihadist view of Islam. ♪ Aslan: The conservatives, the religious groups in Pakistan saw Benazir as a threat to Islam itself. She did represent, in and of herself, the reconciliation of these various strands of ideas. Siegel: She brought fiber optics to Pakistan. She brought cell phones to Pakistan. She brought CNN and BBC to Pakistan. During the middle ages, when Europe was in the Dark Ages, the great universities of Islam were producing all the culture of the world and everything from art to--to algebra, and it was a very open and tolerant society. Well, that was her view of Islam. She, I think, really dispelled a lot of the myths about women in leadership roles. Certainly she dispelled the myth that a woman can't be tough, because she was incredibly tough. Fatima: As someone who claims to be a feminist, she was traditional. This is a woman who didn't shake hands with men and who covered her hair and who believed that women in a certain post should be married. She got so many women to start acting and start going into and making a change and trying to make a difference. She wasn't a feminist. I mean, it's--I mean, I don't know why people think she was, but she wasn't. Benazir does not repeal the Hudood Ordinances, and the Hudood Ordinances are the most violent pieces of legislation against women in this country. Considering the fact that Benazir had to overcome these Sharia Ordinances that so profoundly affect women, it is a miracle that she rose to the position of prime minister. Lamb: The reality was that she needed the support of one of the religious parties to stay in power, and they would not have supported removing those. It was moderation to have in Islam an alternative to this radicalism, to have a kind of Islam where a woman could be elected head of one of the largest and most powerful Islamic countries. I've had political differences with my brother right back to 1981. He led one kind of political movement, and I led another kind of political movement. My mother herself was telling me from the beginning that, "You must come back and face the cases in court." There were over 100 cases that Zia-ul-Haq had fined against Murtaza and Shahnawaz, anti-state activities. I said to him and my mother that, "You do know that if you come back now, the law of the land requires that you will have to go to jail," and they both said yes, and they were prepared for that. He returned to the country in November of 1993, and he was arrested at the airport. He spent eight months in prison in Karachi clearing his name through the courts. The second time she came to power, she was much more confident, but, by that time, she'd changed. I felt that she'd changed a great deal. Fatima: She was a figurehead, because power was the end goal. When you look at Benazir Bhutto's governments and Benazir Bhutto's policies, that's the only thing that is constant. Accusations, accusations, accusations, and I say those accusation were lies. They were unfounded. Of course I had the reins of power. I was prime minister. It was a more aggressive government than the first. Having lost power once before, having been denied her right to rule, Benazir did not take the same chances a second time. The corruption was more extensive, and it was grander. I think they used power to make money, and, you know, she then decided to formalize it by making her husband minister for investment. The word "corruption" is an easy word to bandy about. When you don't like someone, you don't like their politics, and you have a massive propaganda machine at their--at your disposal, you use that to taint political leaders. It's not a government. it is Ali Baba and Chaali's 40 thieves. ♪ We were waiting for my father to come home, and we heard the firing. There were 70 to 100 policemen at the scene. They were in sniper positions in the trees. When he exited, they started firing. The story which I was told was that he and Zardari had fallen out very badly. Siegel: I've never seen Benazir so distraught, so deeply in mourning. The tears would pour from her eyes. People do say she was implicated, but I simply don't believe it. I absolutely don't believe it. Benazir bears the moral responsibility of her brother's murder, absolutely. Benazir always talked about Fatima with love. She would say to me, "She's just been poisoned. This is my brother's daughter. I love her. I love her like she's from my own body." I really feel that his daughter keeps blaming my sister, but really, she's blaming her for my brother's not being successful. I mean, if my sister wasn't in politics, there would be no question. There's no old article that I read about my niece where it doesn't say Benazir Bhutto's niece. It never says Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's granddaughter. It never says Murtaza Bhutto's daughter. My niece is nothing without Benazir. Newscaster: Murtaza's widow accused Benazir's government and her husband Asif Zardari of the murder. Benazir alleged the president Farooq Leghari had had a hand in it. Relations between the prime minister and the president had reached breaking point. In November, the president dismissed Benazir's government. ♪ Nawaz Sharif was himself prime minister for the second time and was intent on destroying once and for all Benazir Bhutto and her husband Asif Ali Zardari. So the government arrested Mr. Zardari on multiple charges, which included the murder of Benazir's brothers. Who brought the charges against Mr. Zardari? Everybody who held and wielded power during this period. When her government fell and Nawaz became a prime minister, there were these cells that he controlled that would bring these charges against Benazir and Asif. And she would go from court to court, and he would go from court to court. Sanam: They were in and out of Karachi jail. I mean, that was like a home away from home in a way at that time. But what they didn't realize, that I'm a fighter, and she was a fighter, and we'd fight to our last breath. Yes, Mr. Zardari is a businessman. He does business. Other people do business. They're entitled to do business, but where is the law violated? I don't know if you can plant something in The New York Times, but there was a very serious article on Benazir's millions in which Zardari was implicated. The House of Graft pretty succinctly in three or four words summed up what I tried to say in 7,000 or 8,000 words, that there was corruption going on, bank statements in the name of Benazir Bhutto and her husband. These stories were planted by the intelligence services in order to justify dismissal of elected government. You know, we are an imperfect business, but we were very confident that we had nailed the case. People don't realize. You know, peop... You're being attacked from all sides. Her husband was in jail. She had three little children. And this was political victimization. They were putting pressure on the judge to take even her ancestral property, which she's inherited from her grandfather and her father. ♪ I had to look after my children. I didn't know how they would be taken care of. My mother is suffering from Alzheimer's. She lives with me. So, both for personal and political reason, I thought that my freedom of movement was essential. My mother was obviously a very prominent person in my life. She was the only parent I had for eight years. Aseefa: When we moved to Dubai, my mom had to go for speeches and things a lot. I mean, we'd write her letters when we were kids and just put it under her door, thinking it was mail. Aseefa: And assume that it was going to her. So when she came back, she'd get all these letters. There were two goals for the paid speeches. One was to get the message out, to keep her relevant, but the other reason was that she was a working woman, and she was supporting her family. Asif was in jail, and some of the money that was set aside was for Bilawal's college education. This did not seem like a woman who had unlimited sources of money at all, I can assure you of that. When I was elected prime minister for the second time in 1993, Pakistan was on the threshold of being declared a terrorist state. The world--the first attack on the World Trade Towers had already taken place. My government understood the potential for the destabilization of the region. ♪ In 1996, when the Taliban took over our neighboring Afghanistan, there were only three countries in the world that recognized it: the United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, and Pakistan. And Benazir, as a supposedly democratic feminist prime minister, extended her country's recognition, support, and aid to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Siegel: It's terribly inaccurate and unfair to say that she was a supporter of the Taliban. She was some--a woman who wanted very much to contain the Taliban and thought that there could be a political solution that they had to be part of. The truth is Pakistan is a military state, and those kinds of issues are dealt with by an increasingly independent I.S.I. Coll: The Pakistanis believed they needed these Islamist groups in order to prevent India from circling around and taking control of Afghanistan, their neighbor. There was a--a military concept called strategic depth, which really depended on a pro-Pakistan Afghanistan to give Pakistan depth to actually retreat if invaded by--by the Indians again. ♪ Newscaster: The people of Pakistan celebrated the birth of the Islamic bomb. Most Pakistanis believe that they deserve a nuclear weapon, and, if for no other reason, they need a nuclear weapon, because India has a nuclear weapon. Dastgir-Khan: The military in Pakistan has complete control over security policy. Prime ministers including Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif, they were mere visitors of nuclear facilities. They did not have control over it. Whether a president or a dictator is in charge, the military is in charge of Pakistan. ♪ Nawaz Sharif appointed General Musharraf Chief of Army Staff, so they worked together for about roughly, say, 10 months before General Musharraf deposed the elected government and became the ruler himself. [yelling] Having accused Nawaz Sharif of an assassination attempt, Musharraf used that pretense in order to take control of the Pakistani State. Pakistan of course has had a number of military coups in its brief history, and Musharraf's coup was very much in line with the previous coups. I wish to inform you that the armed forces have moved in as a last resort to prevent any further destabilization. Pakistan Peoples Party has been struggling to take, uh, military out of politics. And the fact that General Musharraf wears a uniform blurs the distinction between civilian and democratic rule. In order to fight back against the political challenges that he was facing from Benazir Bhutto, Musharraf added an addendum to the constitution saying that a prime minister could only have two tenures. And, of course, since both Benazir Bhutto and Nawaz Sharif had already been prime minister twice, that seemed to preclude the possibility of them becoming prime minister again. I think he's scared of me because I symbolize democracy, and he's scared of the people of Pakistan. He wants to keep in place an order that would deprive the people of Pakistan of opportunity, opportunity for education, for health. ♪ For 11 years of my childhood, my father wasn't with us, so it was--it was my mother who primarily brought us up. Bakhtawar: Every Friday, we sort of had family day, but when it came to 7:00, that was like family dinner time. So no matter what my mom was doing, you know, she could be having, you know, some president, some prime minister, whatever it was and be like-- -"I'm sorry, it's 7:00." -"It's family time." "It's dinner time with my kids." She did thank God for the time that she did spend in exile so that she did get to spend time with us. We spent much more time with her while in exile than we ever did as she was prime minister. And since my dad was away in prison, we were not left alone at the time, but we stuck together because of that. Obviously when she was in exile and he was in prison, they didn't see each other for a very long time, and that was extremely difficult for her and--and for-- and for the kids. Aseefa: We'd still talk to him all the time, We would send him letters and embarrassing drawings that we would make for him, and we'd always call him on-- like, on his birthday, or he would call us on our birthday. Siegel: You know, they grew up without a father. Nothing could bring that-- Nothing could give that back to them. That was taken away from them for political reasons, for no other reasons. She would tell me how lonely she was and how difficult it was to live out of a suitcase and how difficult it was to be away from the children for months and months at a time. And she said, "But that's the nature of my life," and, you know, sometimes she would cry. I mean, you know, she would never cry in public. No one ever saw it. No one ever saw it. She would still make sure that we knew that he's gonna come back here, he will come back, we're gonna be fine, we're all together. She would always remind us of that. This is what this family sacrificed for Pakistan, for democracy. ♪ Burns: By virtually every index, social, economic index, Pakistan has made absolutely woeful progress. Who's helping Pakistan manage in that area? Nobody. You can't have a functioning democracy in a country where people cannot read and write. You can always gauge the political situation in Pakistan by the number of madrasas that exist in the villages and the rural areas. The government relinquished its responsibility in providing education, health, housing, and social services to our people, and parents who were desperate, desperate to house their children, feed them, and clothe them, handed them over to the political madrasas. The political madrasas did house, clothe, and feed the children, but they also provided the poison of hatred. Half the population of 175 million is below the age of 18. This is the biggest recruitment pool for the militants. The Pakistani intelligence service would funnel volunteers into Osama's camps and-- and use his facilities. Osama bin Laden was able to operate with--with impunity. Benazir knew exactly that the elements of the mujahideen that we had empowered were Western haters, and their concept of jihad was going to expand beyond Afghanistan, and we were next on the list. ♪ Once September 11th had happened and given Pakistan's particular relationship with the Taliban and with Al Qaeda, it was really important to get Pakistan reoriented. It was Rich Armitage, the deputy secretary of state, who really had to go and convince the Pakistanis that they had to make a strategic shift. Burns: Musharraf made a very moving speech approximately ten days after the planes hit the towers, which he practically wept, and he said, "We have no choice. We must be partners to the United States in this." Musharraf: There certainly is a disappointment and disenchantment with the United States, but it has not come out of nowhere. Its correction means doing justice. Siegel: The Bush administration totally misjudged the political situation in Pakistan. Musharraf really basically sold George Bush 43 a bill of goods. Musharraf convinced President Bush that he was the only thing standing in the way of a nuclear-armed ayatollah taking over Pakistan. And that was never the case. Ali: I remember being in Pakistan soon after 9/11 and talking to quite senior people, and they said, "The Americans are friends again. We can build strength again," and they then collaborated, but the problem for them now was that some of the people they recruited to fight these wars against the Russians were genuine. I mean, they may be slightly nutty, but they did believe in it. So now to say to these people, "You have to completely turn around, and our new enemy is Islam and the Islamic terrorists and the war on terror," wasn't an easy thing to pull off. Musharraf: We are being blamed. We are being blamed for terrorism and being the source and cause of terrorism. We are not the source. We are not the cause. We're now talking about a state which has at least half a dozen nuclear weapons and no doubt is intent on producing more. ♪ The Pakistani nuclear program was a national asset. This was the--the country's most important military program, and A.Q. Khan was the head of that. A.Q. Khan, with the support of the Pakistani government of the day of Musharraf, was providing nuclear technology to Iran, to North Korea, to Libya. Clearly, this was not a rogue operation. Clearly, it was a Pakistani government operation. Benazir: How could Khan get planes to bring things back and forth? How could Khan leave the country? He couldn't even leave the country. He had to ask for permission. Of course, you know, he could hide it by saying, "I'm going on a religious pilgrimage," for example, and you'd get the permission. But how many religious pilgrimages could he make to a country like North Korea? She was in Dubai, and she was anxious to find a way to return to Pakistan to redeem herself and to redeem her party in national politics. Military rule is the cause of the anarchic situation in Pakistan. Military rule is not the solution. Rice: Well, in fact, some of this had come from the Pakistanis themselves. They believed, and, I think, rightly, that the best alternative for Pakistan would be to bridge democratic, nonextremist forces together. We started very quietly early on, uh, just talking to Benazir, talking to Musharraf about what that would take. ♪ any time with each other. Aseefa: We were so excited. We were, like, hoping to meet him, like, straightaway and everything, so we were waiting and waiting for him to come. And when he did, we were so happy to be like a family again. Siegel: Asif was in jail for, you know, 11 total years, and he had a very bad heart attack in prison under these conditions, but he would not give in. The ultimate question was how could this man, who was accused of so many things, not be convicted of anything? Eleven and a half years in prison, no conviction, and a lot of innuendo and guilt by association. As it was clear that the terms were coming together for her return, I got involved to make sure that it really would lead to an election alternative in which civilian government could return to Pakistan. While the negotiations were going on, Musharraf got weaker and weaker, and Pakistan became more and more unstable politically. Go! Go, Musharraf! Go! Go, Musharraf! Go! Newscaster: Thousands of lawyers are still protesting on the streets of Pakistan cities. The former head of the Supreme Court who was ousted by Musharraf issued a call for lawyers to continue their protests. Aslan: A feud began over the legitimacy of Musharraf's rule. Musharraf, who reigned for most of his regime under emergency law, used his emergency powers to remove the chief justice from power, and that really precipitated, I think, a question of legitimacy for Musharraf's rule. These events made Musharraf more desperate, and they also convinced Benazir that she had a role to play to go back, and that that role would be complicated and would require real national leadership. Rice: I think he knew that she had to come back. Ultimately, if there was going to be a democratic alternative that involved both Musharraf and Benazir Bhutto, she was going to have to come back. ♪ She was truly joyous about this whole enterprise, both to redeem her role in her family's narrative, to emulate her father's bravery and ultimately his sacrifice, and also to restore herself to the center of Pakistani national life, to write a last chapter. Our doors are open to all the political leaders and all the political parties in a search for consensus in Pakistan. She kept saying, "Do you know in eight hours from now, I'm going to be here? In ten hours from now--" "I'm gonna be in my house at this time. I'm gonna be there. Oh, my gosh, I'm going to be in Pakistan." Did I give the children pep talks? She knew what she was doing, and she spoke to us. And, you know, we understood what she had to do. She reminded us that Allah has--is going to protect her and protect us and that she will always come back and visit us from Pakistan. And they will come and visit me when they get their holidays in the winter, won't you? She had a life that a lot of people would have taken, and yet she decided that it was better to leave that behind and step into this uncertainty. I'm, uh, unaware of the details of the security arrangement, but I think the biggest protection comes from God, and, God willing, all will go well. Rice: There were lots of discussions about how her security might take place. It was not going to just be the government, but it was-- it was always going to be very dangerous. Bakhtawar: We dropped her off at the airport, and all the press were there. We had to portray this normal, strong image, but, you know, inside, we were like, "Oh, my God. What's gonna happen?"

It was--it was terrible. Just hours after she returned from exile abroad, the former Pakistani prime minister Benazir Bhutto has narrowly escaped an assassination attempt. While I'm not blaming the government for the assassination attacks on me at this stage, nonetheless, we need to have an inquiry as to why the securit-- why the streetlights had been shut. Her primary reaction to the first attack was her belief that it was state sponsored. And we tried so hard to get more protection from Musharraf, just a protection that a former prime minister is entitled to. And we're rebuffed and rebuffed and rebuffed. Whatever was done was more than the maximum. And any aspersions on me, I take very, very strong exception to it. The choice is between the jihadis and the elements within the administration.
