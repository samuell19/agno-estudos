Here at Bentan Labs, after more than 2 years of non-stop research into chemical, biological and mind power sciences, We have finally discovered the ultimate weapon with which to protect our way of life. Stacky Morte... the future of ecological warfare. The weapon that will give America the power to deliver even greater freedom to the wider world. All of this wouldn't be possible without the help of our sponsors, and of course our founding father: Edison Carter. Remember to avoid Lab 3, Lab 2, and the meeting room until further notice. The project manager, Dr. Matthew Kane, and his personal team are presenting Stacky Morte to our sponsors. Please stay in your personal lab and continue with your work until this meeting is complete. Bentan Labs wish you another great day. So, how long you've been at it today? About 90 minutes. Jesus Tell me, Roger. What exactly do you know about bio-electric fields? Just the basics really. All living cells emit a magnetic energy that... The strength of the field has shown to be greater in people of higher intellect like me. Developing the power to manipulate the field is the next step in the evolution of man Don't you think? If you say so. Seems pretty unlikely to me. But you have raised the eyebrows of some very important people. Edison Carter? I just connected the surveillance cams to the satellite uplink. He isn't too impressed with your mind over matter experiment. So he can see everything going on here? Pretty much, yeah. How positively Orwellian. Dick! Dave Hardy, please report to the Media Room. Dave Hardy, to the Media Room. Fucking asshole. The scientific name for this strain of mold, is Stachybotris Morte. We call it Stacky Mort for short... I mean... It's the end result of 2 years of funding and a very powerful weapon. One, which will usher in a new era of ecological warfare. Chaos gentleman, where order is needed to keep our enemies strong. We unleash chaos. Unstoppable destruction. What is the delivery system? Well... let me bring in the man responsible for the system. This is David Hardy. One of the most important members of our team. David, would you explain to our guests the concept of the delivery system. The Stacky Mort is suspended in a serous gel, and placed in a cylinder like this one. Get the cylinder with the eco-system you want to eliminate... remove the lid and over the course of few days the gel evaporates and... And what is the effect on humans? We haven't done any tests yet. That's not really our forte. Congressman Blankenship. President Blankenship. I pee like a racehorse. Because I'm hung like a racehorse. God fucking bless you Ronnie. What do you think, sergeant Brisco is so intent on I'm sure I've have no idea. Do you mind? Anybody else want some coffee? Get me out of here! At ease Sargent. I'm afraid I haven't introduced you properly. Colonel, this is Dr. Roger Bolton, research specialist. Nice work doctor. It seems to be everything we've been hoping for. Glad you approve, Colonel...? “Need to know.” Colonel “need to know.” Great. Well, you can call me Dr. Know it All. Are you insulting the Colonel, civilian? You say civilian like it's a disease. Come on, you have to forgive Roger. He's full of juice but he's also full of genius. That's not all he's full of. At ease, Sargent Brisco. Come on folks, we're all friends here ya know. Hello... sergeant. Congressman Blankenship. We've already met sir. I know that... I know that Just trying to lighten things up here. Rhodes see if you can scarf up a soda or something. That stuff will kill ya. So they got you working concessions huh? What happened here? Ow! Who does that? Oh come on Jules, that didn't hurt. Can you make yourself useful and help me with this? I would be delighted. What are you doing? What? You don't put feta cheese on crackers, that's for the salad. And you're supposed to tilt the glass when you pour champagne. Keeps it from going flat. Says the drunk. You know if I drank half as much cheese as you ate ...nevermind. No could you repeat that? You heard what I said. No I didn't. So you're talking to me? I wasn't planning on it. I wasn't even supposed to be here but Carter personally requested I make an appearance You deserve to be here. Your theories on genetic manipulation made all of this possible. Dr. Peterson's work was based on your work, everybody knows that. Where the hell is Dr. Peterson? I don't know. Here you go guys, another friend for your sicko group Look I don't know what Carter's plans are, but all this is starting to freak me out. Interesting stuff that mold. A little creepy though. Well a lot of money went into that creepy stuff. We could've used it in 'Nam. The damn jungles were so thick you couldn't see 3 feet ahead of you. That mold could've made all the difference in the way things turned out. I've seen my boys mutilated Blood-soaked Missing limbs Scalded by napalm crying for their mommies... I apologize. I should have asked first. Any problem with me smoking in here? Other than your health? Listen son, if I can survive knife fight with a Cambodian Mountain Jaguar. Then this little cigar ain't got a chance. It's a Cuban. Anyway, I'm not happy to be here I want nothing to do with military programs. I was here one week as an adviser to you. Best advice I ever got. Stop it I'm not talking to you. Fine talk to the cheese since you love it so much. Jules? What the hell are you doing here? I thought... Dave? Hey Hardy, can you hear me? What just happened? I don't know. He's gonna be fine. What's going on? Too much coffee. What? He's fine, just took a spill. Go on back and keep schmoozing the goon squad. Go easy Roger. You'd do well to listen to Ms. Young. This has to go smoothly. Keep in mind these people are in charge of funding our entire project. Which includes your salary, by the way. Help celebrate Well it's a little early to be celebrating Matthew. The compound needs fine-tuning and the control agent? Well, we've had mixed results. Well that's true. But Stack Mort has exceeded all expectations. And that's what these bigwigs want. So who are these so called VIP's? The gentleman in the dark suit is Congressman Stu Blankenship. He's head of the House Appropriations Committee. And the skinny guy next to him is Mr. Rhodes, his assistant That's the Colonel. And the young man next to him is his assistant, Sargent Brisco. Matthew you might want to wring that out. Why do I have to sweat so much? What are you so worried about Dave for? I don't know. He's always been so nice to me. He even asked me out once Wait, what did you say? That is none of your business. Alright gentleman, if you please follow me... Come on Roger To be continued. Are you with us Mr. Carter Oh yes, wouldn't miss this for the world I propose a toast What about Dave? Dave's fine. He had enough to drink Something wrong with the psychic? He slipped. Hit his head on the floor. Unconscious? Trust me, life's better when he's silent. Matthew, speech I guess its no secret that we've been busting our proverbial butts working on this. And even though there's more research in the picture. I think we're at a point where we can say that Stacky Mort is a resounding success and an important addition to our arsenal of freedom. To freedom. To Regan Not much finesse for a politician. Probably STD's from banging Congressional Aides. By the way, what was Dave talking about when he hit the floor? He's probably surprised to see me here. I told him I want to cut ties with this project. Fear of commitment? I'm just not comfortable having my work hijacked for weapons research. So what else needs to happen with this Mold? We're working on an effective control agent. Still in the experimental phase. Are you all right Congressman? Ya know, it's the damnedest thing. It feels like a swarm of fire-ants have been dropped into my underwear. Fire ants? You got a sink in here? There's one right back there Congressman. When these spores land on a moist surface. They begin to grow. No moisture? No danger. Mold spores need 3 things to grow into mold. Nutrients, moisture And time Oh shit. Is there something matter, Congressman. It feels like I'm getting bitten by a million fire-ants all at once. Is that the Mold? Well from the appearance... and with the dispersal rates in this climate... Cut the shit doctor, is this the mold or not? I think so. You think? Shouldn't you know? Ts Stacky Mort. Look how its spreading. How do I get this shit off me? You mean, you don't have anything here to get this off me? Well, its in the experimental phase... its an anti-fungal compound and... The control agent hasn't been tested yet. Shouldn't you at least try? COLONEL: Look how fast its spreading Matthew check the surveillance cams in the lab see if the contamination has spread there. Congressman, just stay put. God damn you Ronnie. Congressman Blankenship It looks clean. Crimson filter. There's no contamination in the lab Roger. Well, this is it guys. Phase 2. Now whose gonna take one for the team? Eenie Meenie Mousey... Please help me... please. Roger, where is the... Stay back! Get the scanner Somehow the mold got into the entire fucking building, scan me. What are we gonna do he can't breath.. Jesus... Mary... ...and Joseph Terribly sorry. How long have I been out? About 40 minutes. Oh fuck. Stacky Mort in action Colonel. How do you like your new weapon. I'm impressed. Excuse me doctors, with all due respect to the Congressman But shouldn't we be hightailing it out of here? We can't just leave, we have a responsibility to contain it. Now the hall is regulated by the dehumidifier, right? Just stick your sweaty head out there and find out. How in the hell did it get in! Well I can still get to the control agent if I put on the isolation suit. What for? The Congressman is already dead I say we get out of here before this shit spreads everywhere. Secure that Sargent. Will the dehumidifier contain the mold? The dehumidifier should keep the mold from becoming an airborne threat. With no water vapor to attach to, the spores should only last a second or two in the air. But if even a single spore latches on to you all bets are off... ...as the Congressman found out. How can you be so glib about this? We have bigger issues than that now. Rhodes don't touch him. For god's sake nobody touch the Congressman. And another thing. We can't leave here until we're sure that the spores are contained and nobody is a carrier. So what do we do with him for now? Get him away from us and contain the spores. Good evening sir, I'm a representative of Hankei Corporation I'm here to brief you on your mission. Right now we just proceeded, as established, to pay you half of the money. As soon as you have completed the mission, we will pay the second part. Now, to remind you what your mission is... You must infiltrate our competitor's facility: the American company Bentan Labs. You must obtain a sample of the mildew You must extract a living, infected subject. You must destroy the facility. We have provided you with a special acid. Remember that this acid is the only way to completely destroy the mildew and any infected threats you may face. We also provided you with a Digital Supporter, which will help you during the mission. From now, we will cease all communications. Good luck, sir. Matthew, help me with this table. We are gonna use this table... Oh I'm sorry Mattew. Why did you do that! I'm sorry buddy We are gonna use this table, to move the body... We gotta fix this leg... Shouldn't we put him in the hallway? Yeah but we need him to test the control agent. As long as nobody touches him we should be fine. How do we contain this? On this scale? The control agent is our best bet. I never put a lot of confidence in maybes. I prefer sure things. We need to initiate toxic emergency protocols. I know what that is. Get the top scientists on the outside to assess the situation and let them work on containment. We need to get to the control agent. What I suggest is that we take the initiative to contain this right here and now and not wait for some jokers on the outside to tell us what to do. I agree. If we wait for help from the outside it can get beyond our control. I'm not sure you appreciate... What's that smell? Sargent Brisco, what the hell are you doing? Should have used non-stick It was all over my hand. You need to stop acting like a vagina Mr. Rhodes. Use your mind to overcome adversity. Look at the big brain on Dave. You're one to talk, bright boy. What's that supposed to mean, Roger? You never put that mind of yours to anything useful. Don't bet on that Roger. Will you two knock it off. Brisco we need to cover that up. Wait wait wait. Looks like it worked Not necessarily, Stacky Mort is a living organism, when its attacked it might retreat. Retreat? It may reverse its direction of growth. Possibly into your bloodstream, in which case... I'm fucked. We don't know, this is unprecedented. So I might have done this for nothing? You should have told us. You put us all at risk by keeping it to yourself. Don't do anything that stupid again. I think it would be wise to segregate the Sargent from the rest of us. You just said I'm not putting off any spores. Not yet. And you may never but we can't have you walking around if the mold is in your bloodstream. Eventually it will manifest on the outside and we wouldn't know it til it was too late... Its solitary for you Sargent Brisco. Alright. So where can Sargent Brisco cool his heels for now? In the lab I suppose. That way we can get to the control agent while we're there. I'll take him. Alright Sargent. I don't want you to think we're abandoning you. You know I'd never leave a man behind. But the civilians? Well, its their job to be smart about things like this. Yes sir If you can't trust them Trust me. You know I'll get you the help you need as soon as possible. Yes sir. If we are gonna do this, let's do it properly Hello, I'm a Digital Supporter, with superior artificial intelligence, upgraded to version1.05 I'll answer your direct questions, and analyze the environment to give you suggestions. Before we start, please type the name of the mission. Thank you, the mission name is “Toxic... Now please type your own name, so I can address you properly. Error... Thank you, your name is Toxic. Hello, Mr. Toxic. Let's start. What a great fucking start. Lab's at the end of the hall, follow me. How's the hand? Nothing I cannot handle, sir. Dave, can you hear me? Yes Matthew I can hear you. Sargent Brisco, please take a seat in front of the camera so we can monitor you. Dave get the control agent and get back here. Go ahead Sargent make yourself at home. You know the combination don't you? Yes, Roger I know the code, I might as well have a hockey glove... I'm fighting nausea and a migraine, so if you could just give me a minute What the hell? Is the Sargent epileptic? No. Dave, you need to turn around. Sargent Brisco? Matthew, crimson filter. Jesus, Mary and Joseph. It's migrated to his brain. Dave, get the hell out of there. What is going on? Sargent Brisco, stand down! May I give you a suggestion, Toxic? Don't call me that name, shit! There will be a lot of mess to clean later in the corridor and in the labs, so for the moment just relax. This place is melting down. The mildew seems to be stronger here. What the hell is this? That canister fell from the sky. Canister? What are you talking about? This mildew is a weapon, but it's not human-made. That canister fell from the sky. It seems like an alien product... a weapon. Someone was probably carrying it to another planet and he lost the cargo. The company found it, but they weren't able to figure out how it works. They used these scientists to test and study it, telling them it was created by some previous team. The company only partially understood its capabilities So today they're going to test it on humans... On the scientists... Toxic So is this acid your boss provided me with more alien shit? I'm not authorized to reveal information related to the Hankei Corporation. It's pretty fucking obvious this is alien made. Hankei found this acid toy, and now they want the Mildew toy. Unfortunately these bastards found it first. You don't need to confirm that, Toaster. 'I´m not a toaster, I'm a Digital Supporter... with superior artificial intelligence, upgraded to version 1.05. Superior my ass. We still have a problem. Sargent Brisco is in the lab and so is the control agent. At least he's contained. Until he finds out there is no lock on the door. Dave should be here any second... Matthew can you bring up the camera in the hallway? There's no camera in the hallway. Ok then, what's keeping Dave. My, my, Mr. Hardy Very exciting. Yeah, a real thrill ride. You've accomplished your assignment quite well. Don't you think its time I hightailed it out of here. There's a bit of a problem with that. To allow you to depart at this moment would spoil the entire experiment. As a scientist, I'm sure you can appreciate that. Fuck you! Now David, there's no reason for profanity. You had your chance and you let it, slip. Stacky Mort is loose and you're here for the duration. You're on your own now, David. Fuck you! I'm now hacking the security camera. I don't know why we're doing this but I'm programmed to follow your orders. Great, so shut the fuck up and work. We can't leave those poor bastards dying here. They don't have any chance without the acid. I want to give them at least one chance. Error. You are not respecting the mission. They are expendables and we can't waste time with this secondary mission. Error... error... My system has been temporarily damaged... temporarily fucking damaged... The system needs to reboot. During the reboot I may produce errors. I may produce fucking errors... Toxic... There's no time for a presentation. I've hacked the security cameras, but communications will be interrupted in few minutes, so listen up. What are you talking about? Everything that Carter told you is bullshit. You're just guinea pigs to him, and that mildew was not created by a human scientist. The mildew is an alien weapon. It dropped from the sky and they found it, and used you for the testing. Your control agent won't work with it. Only the alien control agent is capable of destroying it And it's here, locked with me in room 23. But if you can reach me I might find a way to at least pass you the last bottle of this shit. One last thing... don't trust that fucking Dave Hardy. He's... Mr. Hardy is otherwise engaged. He abandoned you to save his own skin. He probably figured you wouldn't be happy to see him after he deliberately sabotaged your little demonstration. And caused the death of that obnoxious Congressman. Why do I get the feeling we've been had? That's because men like you don't get to be Colonel by being stupid. And don't even think about trying to escape. The building is surrounded by snipers ordered to shoot anyone attempting to leave. Why are you telling us anything at all? Does it get you off you sick fuck? Oh, don't be crude Roger. I just don't want you to do anything foolish like getting yourself shot and ruining a very important experiment. As a scientist, I'm sure you understand. This isn't science, its murder! You son of a bitch. You set us up, you called me here personally. And for now I'm going to sign off... ...and watch the events unfold Do you see me Mr Carter? Do you see me Mr Piece of Shit? Do you see me Mr Piece of Alien Shit? I'm a soldier of fortune. Your Japanese competitors paid me to destroy you and your company, Mr. Carter. It's nothing personal... But your men tried to kill me several times today, so... Perhaps there is such a thing as Karma ...80 when it comes to destroying you, I'll shove a huge dose of Karma up your ass with personal pleasure. On that note... What are we gonna do about Dave? Do about him? Do about him... lets see. He betrayed us all He's dead 10 me. And if he comes knocking on that door I'll make sure he's dead to the world. Don't be stupid. He might have information that can help us get out of here. She's right. We need to capture and interrogate him. Then we can kill him. You should take the Colonel's gun. You know, just in case... if you need it? Don't make me regret this doctor Kane What are you doing? You gonna get yourself killed I'm doing something to save myself... ...which is more than I can say for you What do you expect me to do? There's a Colonel and scientists. I'll only get in the way Grow some fucking balls Rhodes. We're in survival mode here. I'm weak. I've always been weak. Even when I was a kid, my Mom... Wait where are you going? I'm going with you. I don't think so. Oh no? What possible good will that do? You're gonna need somebody to watch your back Jules, this is no time to be stubborn. Maybe I'm just sick of waiting around for something to happen to me. Maybe I wanna take my life into my own hands instead of leaving it to other people. Now, are you gonna suit up? Fucking alien shit! You wanna roll? Let's fucking roll! Carter Improved us The mildew make us stronger I hate these suits. God damned stuffy. Beats the alternative. So you know what I think but what do you make of all this? Using the mold against people. I was all for it until today but now I have to say... I've gained a new perspective. What the fuck... Toxic..t... tt... toxic... As you requested, as you requested, as you requested, you piece of shit. Oh I'm sorry sir. Carter, you're gonna pay for this Colonel, what should we do? I'm thinking! I'm thinking, that weasel Carter is inside this facility with us. How can you know that? I know how these government people operate. You think he's sitting at home on his living room couch watching this on TV? No. He's here. I know it. Do you have blueprints of this building? Sure. Go get them. This is where we are. Here. This is it. The utility room. Far away from us as you can get. Yet larger enough to house a few men. You may be on to something. Colonel, I don't want to beat a dead whore but... Horse! The expression, doctor, is I don't want to beat a dead horse. Sorry but you really shouldn't smoke those. Are you kidding me? This little thing will take a lifetime to kill me. I'm just trying to survive the day. Well, and if you set off the smoke alarm. We're in big trouble. And why is that? Because of the sprinkler system. If you wanted to create a perfect environment for the mold to spread. That would be it. Please. Fair enough. Sounds like rain. Wait Shit we gotta get these suits off quick! Oh my god, the sprinkler system but how? Don't look at me you saw me put that cigar out. No sprinklers in here are there? Supposed to be. Shut it down. For god's sake doctor shut it down. Sabotage Motherfucker. Cocksucker. Son of a bitch. Shit shit shit. What the fuck are we gonna do? You can act like a man! Get away from there. Open up! Wait. Let us in for God sake You can't open that door. Why not? Because if one single spore was in that hallway when the sprinkler went off... Its gonna be covered in mold within seconds. Matthew open the goddamn door. Open the door Rhodes. You asshole colonel. Nobody touch us What happened to your suits? Somebody get me a knife, now! What are you gonna do with a knife? Roger? What the hell are you doing? Colonel, your lighter. Burn it Matthew Somebody put that out before it sets off the sprinklers again. Is it safe? Matthew scan me. Julia. Scan Julia. I think she's OK. The mold can't get airborne as long as the dehumidifier is on Just don't touch me and you're not in any danger. Who goes there? Please. Open the door. My god it's Dave. The hallway is probably completely covered in mold ...and Dave as well. We can't let him in We have to. He'll die out there. If we bring him in, he"ll die in here. What's the difference. He might know something that can help us. I say we give it a shot. He can't be trusted. Trust me. When it comes to interrogation, I can be very persuasive. Yeah, I'll bet. If 1 think he's lying to me... I'll hill him If he tries anything funny... I'll kill him. We get the idea Colonel. Let him in. OK. Dave. I'm gonna open this door. When I do. I want you to walk in very slowly. You try anything. I'll blow your head off. You hear?! Open the door. Get up you son of a bitch! Stand up now! Colonel, back off Jesus Mary and Joseph. The mold is spreading everywhere. What happened to him? Dave what happened? I think he severed my spinal cord. I can't feel anything. Can you feel this? Did he just fucking shoot me? See? Now we know he's telling the truth. Did the motherfucker shot me! Goddammit Hardy, you're a pain in the ass. Matthew can you bring me a broom and tape. I can't breathe. Oh fuck you Hardy. What's the matter? Why don't you use your intellect to manipulate your bio-electric field. He's infected. And so am I. Which makes me the only one who can deal with him. Physically anyway. Are you sure you're up to it? I guess there's not much of a choice is there? Roger you can't Wait, Roger. Use this. You guys aren't seriously considering doing this are you? I'll do the talking. What are you gonna do? That all depends on you. I'm gonna ask you a few questions. And if you don't answer them truthfully, Roger here is gonna do something terrible to you. We know you sabotaged the experiments. Carter was lying. Roger. Wait, wait. I did it. We know you did it. It wasn't a question. What we want to know. Was how the hell were you going to escape? What escape? I was gonna get in my care and leave as soon as the mold started to spread What about the snipers? Were they supposed to know it was you? And not shoot? What snipers? I don't know what you're talking about! Wait! I don't know anything about any snipers!! I guess you and I have more in common than I thought. What if there aren't any snipers? That's not likely. You moron. You were on a suicide mission and didn't even know it. I did it for Julia I thought once I got Roger out of the way, I'd have a shot. She wasn't supposed to be here! I'm gonna Kill you! I'm gonna fucking Kill you! It doesn't matter we're all gonna die anyway! I'm not finished with him Where is Carter. He's in the utility room. I knew it. It doesn't matter. You can't get to him. Oh we can get to him. Where there's a will, there's a way. We have to get Carter. Working. Matthew. Let's put him up on the table. I want to treat the internal organs first. If this doesn't work 100% then I can't be sure we're not infected when we get out. He hardly weighs anything. The tissue in the torso is all deteriorated but the heart, well. It appears to be intact. It's discolored but still moist. The tissue is still tender. I guess it's time for the live demonstrations. Matthew get me the control agent. If we're gonna get out of there then we have to be sure we are free of infection. Let's make me guinea pig number one. First hands then face. Are you sure? Come on! It appears to be working but are you sure? You're face is... Just give me a second... You ok Rhodes? Yeah, I'm fine I just need some water. Need a hand? No I'm fine. Let's do it. It's now or never. You want something to dull the pain in advance? Jules, you shouldn't watch this its not gonna be pretty. Should I count down or something? Oh for god's sake just do it Matthew. Holy smokes! Help this man, you're a doctor! You're a fucking officer you help him! If you broke my glasses I'm gonna fuck you up! I got it in my eyes This place is getting slimed all to hell! Someone have to put this mad dog out of his misery I got it in my mouth. I swallowed some. I got it in my mouth. I think I swallowed some. Julia where are you? Don't touch me I'm infected. Did you see that? That just happened. Its OK we're gonna be fine. It's on the side You're clear Roger. I don't understand. What is it? She almost has no spore at all, they don't seem to be attaching to her. That doesn't make sense she should be swimming in spores. I think you should remove... Well I think you should remove your clothes. Are you fucking out of your mind? The infestation appears to be light but.. Just to be on the safe side. Why don't you take off your face then. Julia he's right. Matthew, you should do the same. Jesus Mary and Joseph, the spores are migrating to her belly. But why! Did someone leave the faucet running? This motherfucker is getting moldy Should I kill him? Its in the plumbing. We have to spray the whole place down No way Colonel, all the control agent that we had is in that bottle For god's sake, take cover! Get down! Did what I think just happened, happen? Affirmative. Dr. Kane had a lot of guts. Oh god it stinks. It is safe to say that the situation has gotten out of hand. The way I see it, our only chance is to evacuate this building, snipers or not. OK Colonel, whatever you say. How do you suggest we do this? We have to get Carter. He can be our take out of here. How are we supposed to get Carter? Roger is blind, and we have one gun between us. I didn't say it was gonna be easy. But we've run out of options. We have to force our way into the utility room Sir Sir. I'm under heavy gunfire. Looks like somebody turned the tables on that plan Brisco! That's it! He's our wildcard. Wildcard are you crazy? He's not even playing with a full deck. As far gone as he is, he'll still listen to me. Stand down soldier! I have sustained heavy casualties, sir! I have your orders. Escobar, is barricaded in the utility room. At the end of the south hall. I can't hear you over the gunfire. Sir speak up Gunfire, what is he talking about? Stand back from the door! I'm coming int! When I open this door. I want you, to stand back You're gonna open the door to an axe wielding maniac? He's our axe wielding maniac! Jesus Mary and Joseph. For god's sake. At ease Sargent. My god, how is he still standing? What are my orders, sir? OK Sargent. I have one final mission for you. You have to infiltrate the utility room Once inside, you will face heavy resistance. Your orders are to capture Escobar. Alive! I will cover you from the inside. This is fucked. We don't stand a chance. You are an excellent soldier. And I know you will make me proud. Yes, sir. Let's roll. Jesus I can feel that stuff under my feet. Creepy My hands are getting fuzzy You two flank that door! Move it! Sgt. Brisco, break it down! Stay behind me Mr. Carter, I'll protect you. We should go in there Jules we gotta help. You're blind and I'm unarmed in my underwear. Would you rather be dead in your underwear? Get me my cigar... Please... Do you really think by killing me you're gonna get out of here alive? And if I let you live we"ll survive? It can be arranged. He's lying. Shoot him. No. I have a better idea. Open it. CARTER: You're gonna die out there. JULIA: Shut up!! Those snipers can take out a bird's eye from a thousand yards I don't believe there are any snipers. Believe what you want. It's your funeral. You never put that mind of yours to anything useful. You're a fraud You never put that mind of yours to anything useful You should have listened to me. Did you really think you were gonna get out of here alive? Did you really think you were just gonna get in your car and drive off into the sunset. Though I must say, you're gonna make a beautiful corpse It's Karma time, Carter! I'm sorry, lady, I need an infected human subject And unfortunately you're the last human standing here. System rebooted. I'm checking the mission status. Mildew sample acquired. Infected human subject acquired. Competitor company destroyed. Mission accomplished, Toxic. May I add a personal note? This mission has been entertaining, Toxic. I told you... don't fucking call me that name.
