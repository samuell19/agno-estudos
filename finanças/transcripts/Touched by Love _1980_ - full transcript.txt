[♪♪] LENA: I once met a girl. Karen was her name. We were drawn to each other... and to Elvis. Life will never be the same. [♪♪] DON: Hey! Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Ah. Hi. Hi. You're Lena, right? Yes. That's what I thought. These all you got? Let me help you with these things. Thank you. Yeah, you're just in time for a birthday party. Yes? Yeah. All the kids want to meet you. That's nice. Boy, am I ever glad to see you. You are? Why? Well, two more hands, two more legs. It's tough getting help here. Oh, oh, I'm sorry. Excuse me. My name's Don Fielder. I'm one of the doctors. Just a title, don't let that spook you. We all do everything around here, you know? Well, I'm Lena Canada. Well-- Yeah, I know. I think you know that. Oh, yeah. Let me see. College dropout, no training, no credentials. But, uh, we need you. [KIDS LAUGHING] TOPPER: So once again, the Brown House Bullets have destroyed the Brown House Turtles by a score of 72 to nothing. CHILDREN: Fifty-nine to 58. Fifty-nine to 58. Fifty-nine to 58. Fifty-nine to 58. Fifty-nine to 58. Fifty-nine to-- What was the score, Lou? Louie says 72 to nothing, which is as good as 59 to 58. What difference does it make? You lost and we won. Right, Louie? CHILDREN: Boo! Boo! Boo! Fifty-nine to 58. All right, all right, all right. We all know, the Brown House Bullets won. Now calm down, we're gonna play another game in a minute. Now that's Margaret. She's some kind of special lady. This little guy there with the big tongue, that's Tony. Hi. You're too skinny. Hey, hey. She is not. Are you visiting somebody? You. Uh, I'm Lena. Your new aide. You're mine. [LENA LAUGHS] Yours and everybody's. You're mine. He doesn't care. MAN: Are you going flirty, buddy? Huh? [KIDS CHATTERING] [KNOCKS ON DOOR] You decent? Yeah, but don't let that discourage you. Oh, what'd you say, kid? We got your roommate here. Amy, this is Lena. Lena, this is Amy. Hello. No. No. Wrong bed. Just what I needed, competition. You sure you didn't get the wrong address? Hope not. Um, before you settle in, let me warn you. The beds are lumpy, the hours are long and I can talk a blue streak in my sleep. You can talk a blue streak any time. Why don't you stop drooling? AMY: Beneath all this beauty, I sense a thick layer of solid character and good judgment, which should leave you right where you were when she arrived. [LAUGHS] Actually... he's a first-rate doctor and not the worst port you could find in a bad storm. DON: Well, she has good taste. And so what about you? I don't know. What about me? I'd never figured you for a career as a nurse's aide. Oh. Well, it's not exactly a career. This is my first job. Worried? A little anxious. Well, don't be. You'll be just fine. Come on, I'm gonna take you down to the party. Come on. Go ahead. I'll be down in a sec. Oh, can I leave these here? Sure. Oh, bye. Goodbye. [WOMAN WHISPERING] [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Oh. WOMAN: All right, lunchtime. Lunchtime. Come on, let's go. Topper, Nancy'll bring Louis. Louis is as close to what some people call a "vegetable" as we've got. But Topper adores him, talks to him all the time, plays with him, tells him his secrets. Sort of an imaginary playmate. Like that. I had one. His name was Herman. He lived under my bed. Herman? You'll fit right in here. Come on, I know Dr. Bell wants to talk to you. What about her? Oh. Tony, you'll bring Karen, won't you? You bet. [BOY LAUGHS] Hi. Hi. Take these seats, Monica. MARGARET: There's Dr. Bell. You're gonna love her. You know, she did all of this. You probably don't remember any names yet, but Jimmy walks and talks with braces. Vince is locked in a body that just doesn't work at all. He's doing wonderfully. Once he discovered the typewriter, he just bloomed. That's the main thing you have to know. They have to talk, in any way that they can. Gestures, sign language, typing. Words, if they can. And you must talk to them. I will. I mean, I'll try. I know you will. That's all there is to nurse's aide training. Just work like a lunatic around here. Now I'll show you the therapy. They hate it. Most are quite bright. They're just locked in. Except for Topper. He's more than bright. He's a genius. DR. BELL: What are you mad about, Topper? Oh, I don't know. I guess Louis just gets to me sometimes. That's all. Our kids all come from different backgrounds. Rich, poor, accepted, abandoned. Lena, why don't you sit there? There. Do you think Matty will still feed us? Let's see now, you know Tony and Don. Hi. Hi. This is Vickie. Have you met Vickie? Hi. And this is Monica. Hi. Hi. That's Louis. Louie says hello. And of course, you know Topper. And that's Karen. Have you met Karen? Well, no. Well, we saw each other. We really didn't say hello. Hi. Honest, she can answer you. What are we having? Soup. [♪♪] Um, he's doing his math. Yes, I know. He told me. Okay. Push-ups. Come here. Right here. One, two, three, four, five, six. You're so strong. I am not. Yes, you are. But you're lazy. [LENA LAUGHS] [KIDS CHATTERING] Do you like it here, Lena? Yes, yes, I do. Why? Why? What is it about working at Brown House that you like? I like helping. And having people need me. Is that selfish of me? Not at all. We all want to feel needed. The sad thing is not everyone is willing to admit it. You're gonna do just fine. [♪♪] No toe holds. [KIDS PANTING] TONY: All right, one, two... [BOYS LAUGHING] Okay, Louis, it's your move. Say, you're really out to win, aren't you? TONY: Off the mat. You're off the mat. That's three. Your move again. [BOYS LAUGH] LENA: "So the three bears came home "and they found all their porridge gone. "Mama bear said, 'Who's eaten my porridge?' And the papa bear said, 'Who has eaten my porridge?'" Jason, do you like porridge? I hate it. [LAUGHS] I hate it! Oh, you do, but you like thumbs, huh? All right, who wants some candy? Oh, can I have some, please? CHILDREN: Me, me, me, me! All right, that's enough. Hi, Jason. Don't fall on the legs now. Anybody here interested in candy? Oh, me, me. Yeah, time out. Yeah, yeah. I bet. There you go. You. You. You've been a good boy, you get some too. Oh, thank you. How about you? Is that for me? Thank you. DR. BELL: Here you go. How about you? Karen? [♪♪] AMY: Maybe we could drive into town on Sunday. Raise a little hell. Oh. Can you believe that we are spending our peak years in this zoo? After 20, your muscle tension goes. And then it's downhill for the rest of your life. Sagville. That include your brain? You're such a wimp. How long has Karen been here? AMY: She's been here since I came here. So many of these kids are bounced around from home to home. She have a setback or something? No. She's just like Louie. She's part of the furniture. Listen, let's just not talk about the kids after we put them to bed. I mean, otherwise, we're gonna go nuts. [SIGHS] I'm just too tired to sleep. I'm gonna see if Matty left some coffee. Matty always leaves coffee. And you don't need it. Why don't you just loosen up, talk to me? What are you doing here? Same as you, I guess. Well, you guessed wrong. 'Cause I made a mistake I figured I'd catch a doctor. Oh, that was a mistake. No, that's not why I'm here. [BOTH LAUGH] [LENA GIGGLES] Mm, I'll get it. Okay. I knew you'd say that. Now don't you eat this. It's called sublimation. Food instead of men. Monica. You got all tangled there. [♪♪] There. There you go. Go to sleep. [CRYING] Karen. DR. BELL: Karen's mother was young. She couldn't deal with it. She signed papers days after Karen was born, just gave her up. She's been here two years. I don't know what happened to Karen. She can't tell us. No, she won't tell us. But I've seen it. The green painted walls, white-coated bodies, terminal apathy. I've seen a look on her face when she thinks that nobody is watching her. A look of concentration and intelligence. You mean that look of staring into space? No, no. It's not just staring into space. There was concentration. I think you're seeing something you want to see. Karen turned in on herself. She turned her back on the whole world as if she knew her heart was quite literally breaking. I'm afraid it's hopeless. I'd like to give it a try. We all tried. Even the children. They gave up too. We spent more time with Karen than any of the children and nothing. There's no change at all. I'd still like to try. I may sound heartless, I think there are other children here who will respond better and be helped by it. Please. Let me try. In my time off. I don't want you to get attached. Are you saying I can't work with her, Dr. Bell? I mean, on my own time? No. I'm just warning you. She'll break your heart. Oh, it's beautiful. I've never been here before. Have you been here? It's very warm today. Are you too warm? Do you think the blanket's too warm? I really believe that kings and queens and knights of armor came at night. I'd work all day, turning an old stump into a castle for them. And I'd make the the hallways out of moss. And I'd get the best quartz from the bottom of the lake. Or actually, we can use pebbles and sticks. Oh, and leaves for the bedchambers. Let's see. Wouldn't that be sweet for the bedchamber? There. Well, okay. Where do you think the bed chamber should be? Here? I think that's a pretty good spot. How does it look? You think they'll like it? I mean, if they were real, do you think they'd like it? Mmm? Well, anyway, it's time for us to get back. At another day, we'll make it gorgeous. You'll see. You like it here, don't you? We'll come back. Okay? ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪ ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ ♪ And on his farm He had some chicks ♪ ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ ♪ With a oink, oink here And a oink, oink there ♪ ♪ Here an oink, there an oink Everywhere an oink, oink ♪ ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪ ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ ♪ And on his farm He had some cow ♪ ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ ♪ With a moo, moo here And a moo, moo there ♪ ♪ Got a oink, oink here And a oink, oink there ♪ ♪ Old MacDonald had a farm ♪ ♪ E-I-E-I-O ♪ And look how beautiful they came. Doesn't it look beautiful, Karen? I wish you could help me. Mmm? Well, one day. I wonder if they liked it. Well, if they didn't, they can just go make one of their own. Do you know what's over there? Huh? Just beyond that mountain there? Strawtown's over there. It's a little town, right on the river and, oh, it's very pretty. The river, I mean, and wide. And in the winter it all freezes over. We'll go there someday. I'll ask Dr. Bell if we can take a drive in my car and I'll show you the river. And we can go into Strawtown. There's some stores. And you can buy things like magazines and records. And then there's a movie theater. Amy, Tony and I went there for a movie one night after you were all asleep. It was something with Peter Sellers. He was very funny. Well, I guess I'd better get you back before the weather changes again and we get stuck out here. We'd have to call a tow truck. Wheelchair and lost soul stuck in the mud. Just eat it. I hate it. Oh, please. Come on. Now open up. Open up real wide. That's a boy. That's a boy. What? All right, you get out of here now. Come on, you're going out. You get out of here. And you come back when you find some manners. It just ain't my day. Well, let me tell you something. Right this minute, I think I'd... I think I'd like to be holed up in a lab somewhere with just a bunch of mice. I know the feeling sometimes. I wish I could-- Oh, I don't know. It's crazy. I can't find the manners. You can't find what? I can't find any manners. You can't find any manners? Give me a big kiss. Give me a big kiss. Give me a big hug. When Robert and Sammy got to Minot, North Dakota, they were so tired they could barely lift their tails. When they left the basement of Brown House, they had no idea how big the world was. They'd been in that boxcar for days, going thousands of miles. Going thousands of miles... and there they are in this dumb little town and they can't get a motel room. Nobody takes mice willingly. I talk and talk, don't I? I must sound really stupid. [♪♪] [KNOCKS] Yes? It's Lena. Come on in. That's beautiful. Sit down. Why don't you paint during the day, when there's light? There's no time. Lena, the other children are starting to complain. About me? About you and Karen. Jason thinks it's his fault that you don't love him anymore. Oh, it's not. I-- Monica says you promised to help her with a book report. Oh, I'm sorry. I forgot. You're creating a lot of resentment. It won't happen again. That's right, it won't. What I'm about to say is not a spur-of-the-moment decision. I've thought about it, wrestled with it, and tossed over it more nights than you'd believe. The long and the short of it is simply this. I'm going to make arrangements to have Karen transferred to a hospital. What? I don't understand. Why? To make room for some child who might make it all the way with our help. It's as simple as that. Well, that's not fair. You haven't given her a chance. She's not on trial, Lena. I'm sorry. I didn't mean it that way. Of course you did. Because you believe in miracles or hope for them. Well, I don't. I can't. Not in Karen's case. This may sound harsh but at best, her time is limited. You can't be sure. I can make a very educated guess. Unfortunately, we are not omnipotent. We can't stave off the inevitable. So we just write her off? It's late and we're both rather tired. I'm sorry. It's just that... It's just so damned unfair. Can you tell me how soon? A few days, a week. Thanks. Hey, Lena, don't kill him. We need him. He's our last volunteer. It's Karen. I wanna shake her. I wanna hit her. Yeah, I know the feeling, kid. You don't hit a wounded little bird. You cup your hands around it. You give it love. She won't let me. Well, Robbi would. Vickie would. Jason would. I have to reach Karen! I have to reach Karen. It's so goddamn selfish. What am I trying to prove? What a great therapist I am? Is she a challenge to me? You know, Lena, you sound like you could use a day off. A lot of good that would do. You know, Dr. Bell started Brown House for selfish reasons. Sure, Tony. Yes, she did. She had a son just like Louie. He died in a state institution. Well, there wasn't anyplace like this around at the time. Being selfish, it sort of insures your commitment above and beyond the call of duty. You follow me? I mean, it's not a bad thing. Go ahead, take a day off. I'll tell the queen bee. Thanks. It's all right. Just don't kill my little friend there, huh? [♪♪] WOMAN: And then you have to do it in 10 seconds. Now watch. I'm gonna walk it for you. Here we go. This way. There are only two colors. Oh, hi there. Two colors. This way. Come on, Jody, this way. And that's it. Okay, let's start. Topper, you ready? Go! Come on, let's go. [CHILDREN CHEERING] [IMITATING CAR ENGINE REVVING] [CHILDREN CHEERING] Hello, Karen. Talk to me. [SOBBING] Please talk to me. [♪♪] [CRYING] Lena. Lena. Lena. Yes. Lena, that's my name. [♪♪] [CHUCKLES] [♪♪] What do you think about the stairways hazelnuts or berries? Eat them. What? Oh, the squirrels. Oh, you're right. Well, I don't feel like fighting them. How about you? Come on, wanna fight? Come on. Come on. No? You're lazy. How are you gonna beat up Monica the next time she gives you a hard time, hmm? [CHUCKLES] Come on, come on. That's it, come on, get it up. Oh, you're getting so strong. [GRUNTS] Come on, do it again. Come on. Come on. One, two, three. [CHUCKLES] Tell... me the... mice. Tell you what? Mice. Ice? Ice cream? I'm sorry. I'm a real dummy, remember? Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm. Go on, be patient. Say it slowly. Tell... me... the... mice. Oh, the mice. Oh, the mice. How could I forget about the mice? Well... where were we? [♪♪] Right, right. Jail. Well, they got into a slot machine in Vegas and rigged it. And then they lied to the bartender. They put on some hats and ties, and said that they weren't mice at all. They were just pink rabbits and he was just seeing things. [BOTH LAUGHING] You did it, you did it. Now then, let's try this again. Fuzzy Wuzzy was a bear. Fuzzy Wuzzy had no hair. Can't... the rest. Oh, no. I'm not gonna tell you the rest. You tell me the rest. Fuzzy Wuzzy... Now, now, now, you're forgetting to relax. Breathe. Now forget about the words. Think about something you like. [♪♪] What are you thinking about? Music. Well, keep on hearing it. Now try it again.

There we go. Have a good day now. Goodbye. Bye-bye, Louis. I'll be back after lunch and I'll tell you all about it. Remember, don't hit anyone. And don't tell any lies. Maybe I can get us something. Maybe I can get us a bike. Bye, Louis. Next time you got to learn... Oh, wow. GIRL: Hey, Karen, look what I got. You're bushed, huh? [SIGHS] It stands to reason. Been a rough day. Hey, look, I'm gonna take Louie for a walk. You wanna come along? Maybe in a while. Karen? No. The boss says no. Okay. See you later. Okay. You wanna work on your mask? I don't care. It's right inside. Let's go work on it. What are you thinking about? Nothing. Oh, come on. I know you better than that. You keeping secrets from me? No, nothing. Okay, don't tell me then. I won't be able to sleep. But don't worry about it. I won't be able to eat either. I'll just wither away, but don't worry about it. Let me see it. I hate it! It's ugly, like me. You are not. Whatever-- I am. I wanna be pretty. Monica's pretty. So are you. Don't lie. You're not supposed to lie. I am not lying. I'm here. I'm always here. You're not my mom. I wish I were. Do you know her? No. I don't know her. I hate her. No. You don't know. Maybe she's really nice. She could visit. Yeah. She could. My mother doesn't come to visit me. I guess we all have to learn to make it on our own at some point. I hate her. I don't want her. You don't even know her. I don't care. I don't want her. I don't want to see her. I want a mother who visits and can play. And can do the things a mother is supposed to do. [♪♪] Hey, I've got an idea. You stay right here. Okay? I'll be back. LENA: You happy? TONY: Yeah, I'm happy. You happy? [ALL LAUGHING] [♪♪] In here? Okay. LENA: Here we go. Thank you. You're welcome. Hey. What? Licorice? Bubble gum? What kind? I didn't know you liked bubble gum. Do you like bubble gum? But you want bubble gum? You hate bubble gum, but you want bubble gum? Yeah. Typical woman. [CHUCKLES] Okay, how many? Four? Too much? No. Can you hold these, please? We may want something else.

DON: Come here, Jason. Don't run away from me. You trying to get away from-- Oh, you're so fast. Come here. I'm gonna get you. All right, I gotcha. I gotcha. I tricked you. Yeah, you tricked me, you little pain in the ass. Oh, what do you say? I just-- I was just trying to get him into bed here. Their parents, they really get them hyper, you know? They do get under your skin, don't they? Yeah, well, I wouldn't go that far. Lena? Yes? Uh, nothing. Nothing. Are you sure? Yeah, nothing. Really. I'm not much into religion, but if I were, I'd certainly have a lot of questions to ask. Of whom? Whoever put all this beauty out here and all that misery in there-- Watch it, Amy. You're starting to get profound. Listen, roomie, [SIGHS] I may not be the heaviest thinker you've ever met, but I do have my thoughtful moments. Sex is not a total preoccupation. You could have fooled me. On the other hand, I'm not ready to commit to a life of celibacy either. Speaking of which, I suppose you know that Don has developed a healthy case of the sighs over you. Oh, sure. What's such a big surprise? You know, you're a nice-looking lady with a lot going for you upstairs. It's an unbeatable combination. If I were a man, you'd certainly get my vote. I'd better check on Karen. She's had a big day. There you go, running for cover again. Don't you find it's nippy out here? Why don't you stop ducking issues? You know what you need, what you ought to have, is a kid of your own. Forget that one. That is if you can ever figure out how to go about it. She's gonna die, you know. Don't say that. It's lousy, but it's true, Lena. A lot of CP's never reach puberty. They've got heart problems. They've got complications. Oh, you know that. Yeah, well, a lot of them lead a full life. And that, my friend, is called denial. [KAREN CRYING] Karen, what's wrong? [CRYING] Why? Tell me what's wrong? [♪♪] [♪♪] What are you doing? It's cold out here. Waiting for Lena. You wanna wait? Uh-uh. See you, I'm cold. Hi. What's that? A present. Come on. For who? It's Louis' bike, all folded up. Come on. Don't tease. It's for me. Maybe. Or maybe not. Get in. I never got a present before. Relax. You know, when you try too hard, the words don't come. [♪♪] Why did you give me this? I just wanted to give you a present. Why this? Well, you like music and I always liked him. I mean, his singing. Damn it, Karen. I can't lie to you. I never really thought much of him before until last night, until I saw you crying and holding his picture. Holding his picture and crying. Then it hit me. Maybe there's someone who means a lot to you that I didn't know about. I mean, someone very special to you. I wasn't sure and I didn't know how to ask you. I thought maybe you didn't want me to know about it. But, Karen, I love you so much. And if this person means something to you, I'd like to make you happy and give you one of his records. I wasn't going to ask you anything. I wasn't going to tell anybody about it. I just simply wanted to make you happy. I never meant to upset you. I am sorry, really, I am sorry. Okay. Okay. Did you mean what you said? You love me? Do you really have to ask? I mean, really? Yes, I do. Really. You wanna know something? If you want to tell me. He's... he's so alive. I love him. And he's sad too. "Too"? I could never move like that. Ever. I know. But you can do so much. Not that. I know. Karen, do you do you wanna listen to it? Yes. Come on. [KAREN IMITATING CAR ENGINE REVVING] [LENA LAUGHING] KAREN: Faster. I really can't. Okay. Okay. I'll pretend. [CHUCKLES] Is that what you used to think about? About lots of things. About him. You promise me you won't tell anyone? Scout's honor, cross my heart, hope to die. 'Cause they'd laugh. I don't think they would. A lot of times people don't understand how we feel, Karen. There. Do you want to play around the castle, hmm? Come on. We could turn it into Graceland. What's that? Where he lives. Ooh. Ooh. Come on. One, two three. KAREN: Steps go here. And... Here? KAREN: And the table inside. Where? Here? Uh-huh. All right. Make them nice. Mother's room. Here? Mother's room. Bought it for her when he got rich. She used to clean people's houses. It's a castle, but he doesn't like fancy stuff. How do you know all that? Magazines. Monica's. In the playroom. [CHUCKLES] He's good. Really nice. So... God let him have everything. That doesn't always mean-- [CHUCKLES] Hey, hey. Hey, hey. BOY: Keep going, Tony. Hey, hey. [KIDS WHOOPING] Come on, keep moving. Don't get lazy now. Hey, hey. [CHILD LAUGHING] Watch out, you. Get up, get up! WOMAN: You know Louie doesn't understand of what's going on. TOPPER: I don't care if he understands or not. He understands enough for him. Yes, that's true. But you're gonna be missing him, I'm afraid, more than he's capable of missing you. Don't you wanna come home with us, darling? Yes. TOPPER: Can Louie come and live with us, Mom? TOPPER'S MOM: We couldn't take care of him. I'd take care of him. I do now. It's not practical, Topper. He needs a whole team to take care of him. You know that. I'm not saying that you haven't done most of it. MAN: Come on. [KIDS CHATTERING INDISTINCTLY] Could Topper come and visit Louie from time to time? Oh, I'll bring him as often as possible. Perhaps Louis could come to visit us from time to time. Bye-bye, Louie-Blooie. Don't take any wooden nickels while I'm gone. [♪♪] Baby, what's the matter? What's the matter? Slowly. Come on. Relax. Take a deep breath. Topper's leaving Louis. You're gonna leave me. No, not me. Not ever. No. Everybody always leaves. No. [SOBBING] [ELVIS PLAYING OVER RADIO] Hi. How's it going? Oh, she's taking you, huh? Yeah. Louie said he wanted to listen too. Is that all right with you? Sure. It's your move. What are you thinking about? I wonder what he's doing... right now. We can find out. How? We can write to him and ask him. I can't write. You can type it. [LAUGHS] No. I have to write it. Okay. Make your move. That's the way, Ralph. Good shot. Oh, my heavens. You're gonna serve this time. That's it, good shot, Robin. Good. Yeah, yeah, that's it. Thank you. He'll know my letters are special. He'll get it in the morning. It's special. If I can write better. If not, he won't know anything. Keep practicing. It's looking good. No, it's not. Turn the page. Have you thought about what you're going to say? That's all I think about. Wanna play? I'm the doctor. Steven's the nurse. Not now. I'm writing. Boring. Not to me. Okay. Well, at least take your pill. What's wrong with her? Nothing. It's my pretty pill. I take one every day. Gee, it looks swell. It's not fair, I need one. I do. You sure this address is right? It's the one in all the magazines. Okay. It'll take three days, maybe a week to answer. But what if he's just too busy? You know how hard he works. He's making movies and cutting records and all those things. I know, he's busy. But when he reads my letter, he'll care. I just don't want you to get too upset-- He'll answer, you'll see. You worry too much. Yeah, I know. But it's an old habit. I'm getting better. Yeah, it's open. Hey, come in. We needed a break. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to interrupt you. I just had a question for both of you. Don't be silly. Really, we're bleary-eyed. We've been updating every chart. Sit down. Now ask us 10 questions. Just one. I don't want to overtax my mind. Sunday's visitors' day again and I want-- Well, I'd like to take Karen to a movie. She's never been to one and I thought... I thought I'd better check. I mean, medically. I don't see any-- I don't see any reason why not. Terrific. Thanks. I just wanted to make sure. Lena, as a matter of fact, Lena, we just finished doing Karen's chart here. And it's amazing what you've done. Karen's done it. Her muscle reactions, she's gone way past any kind of medical predictions. She's lived way past any medical predictions, with that heart of hers. It's all right, okay? I know I have to remember the reality. We really can't predict, Lena. Look at Karen. Six months ago, we'd never have thought it possible and look at Monica, she wants to be a doctor. I think she will be. Well, I've decided to let the future take care of itself. The present seems quite enough. Thanks. I can't wait. I hope he jiggles and wiggles and shakes all over the place.

Whoops. [LAUGHING] I think you're tired. That only happens when you're tired. I have to. It hasn't been that long since-- It's been too long. Can we mail this early? Sure. Monica's mad at you. Why? She thinks you're keeping secrets from her. You know, with your screen closed. What'll I tell her? I don't know. You're better at things like that than me. Yeah. Tell her-- Tell her the truth. Tell her I have a pen pal, and he's a secret. She likes secrets. Okay, I'll try that. Stop pretty soon, okay? It's late. Karen said she's got a pen pal and that he's a secret. Hey, she said you like secrets and that you'd understand. I like my secrets. Oh, Monica, I know the feeling. Tell her she forgot her pill. Okay. Do you want me to give it to her? Okay. Okay. Bye-bye. [THUNDER CRASHING] [♪♪] Waiting makes it worse, you know? I can't help it. Something must've gone wrong. It's all those people. Which people? The secretaries, bodyguards, people. Maybe somebody else got my letter. I know he would have answered. Boy, it's coming down. Anything for us? You can take a look, but I didn't see anything. Maybe it's still there, though. Okay. I'm gonna get out of this coat. Excuse me. Come here. Come right over here. [INDISTINCT CHATTERING] Nothing for you, kid. Sorry. Well, I think Miss Karen here has a real nasty cold. So you're gonna have to stay in bed for a couple of days. Keep warm for me. Will you do that? Hot tea and chicken soup. Nobody's come up with anything better. You want me to read to you? Mmm? Or do you want me to go on about the story about the mice? Are you okay? What's the matter? Nothing. Come on, we can talk about it. I don't want to talk. Are you thinking about-- No. Karen, please don't shut me out. Come on, we can talk about it. Are you hurting anywhere? No, I'm tired. I wanna go to sleep. Please let him answer. Hot stuff, aren't you? You can't even send a goddamn postcard. Every day she just sits and waits for that letter. It's never going to come. Well, Lena, for Pete sakes, where were you the whole time? Why didn't you try stopping her? Stop her? I encouraged her. It was my idea. I mean, what did you expect? A little compassion. I don't know. I just wanted to bring a little happiness into her life. Damn it! The point is, I should have known better. It was stupid and destructive. Every day the disappointment becomes more painful. So every day she withdraws that much more within herself. My God, she's practically regressed back to the point where we first started. Not to mention that now she resents me. I don't believe that. Well, she has every right. You may have made a mistake but you didn't commit a crime. Yeah, well, it's debatable. Where you going? Out. It's freezing outside. You'll catch pneumonia. Good. It's snowing, Karen. I picked up the mail. There's a letter for you, Karen. [GASPING] Lena, get the oxygen. It's all right, Karen. Take it easy. Lena! That's good, Karen. That's good. Here. Just a little more. There you go. Just a minute. Is she all right? I think so. Where's the letter? Take it easy, Karen. Now you help me, sit up here. That's a girl. I told you it would come. You worry too much. Yeah, I know. But I'm getting better. It's like a dream. It's a long story. It's a letter from my friend. And he really is my friend. I'm glad you got a letter from your friend, Karen. Keep an eye on her. I'll be right back. [LAUGHS] It's not long. Do you want to hear it? Do I want to hear it? What a question. Come on up. There. Okay. "Dear Karen. "Forgive my handwriting. "It's a mess. "I always seem to be in a hurry. "Forgive me, too, "for not writing sooner. "There is so much mail "that I don't always get a chance "to read it all. "I'm real sorry. "Will you give me "a chance "to make it up to you? "I really want to be "your friend. "I want to hear "all about you. "What do you look like? "What do you like to do? "What do you like to play? "I'm glad you like my music. "I'm sending you "a special address "so your letters "will come straight to me. "Write back soon. Your friend, Elvis." [LAUGHING] Elvis. KAREN: "Dear Elvis. Thank you. "I knew we'd be friends one day. "Forgive my handwriting. "I like you so much. "You asked me to tell you about me. "I've got cerebral palsy, "so I can't walk. "But I have a motor chair. "I don't think I'm pretty. "I hope you won't mind. "I'm really happy that you wrote. Love, Karen." [LAUGHING] TONY: Hey, all right. Where's the card? The card? There it is, there it is. There it is. I'll get you there yet. I got you there. Okay, letters. I can mail it. You sure? It's awfully high. You think all that exercise went for nothing? Okay. Well, let me fix you. Get you a little closer. Hold on. Okay, there you go. It's up, but it's frozen. Okay, off we go. KAREN: "Dear Elvis, I really mean it. "If you're too busy or too tired, "don't bother to write. "I'll just keep writing. "Tony's going to take a picture of me. "I'll send it to you. "Do you think I should cut my hair? Love again, Karen." "I'm glad you think I'm pretty. "I won't cut my hair. "I've been thinking a lot about what I could send you. "Tony took some pictures and I'm going to send you one. "It isn't much, but I wanted to give you something. "You've sent me so many presents. "Thank you for the card. "Just write when you can. I'd love for you to come and see me." You writing your friend? Uh-huh. Come in. Do you suppose your friend might have a friend I could write to? I don't know. I can ask. What do you want for Christmas? Nothing. I have everything I want. I'll think of something. Good night. Night. Sleep tight. There. Uh-huh. It looks weird. If you're not going to help, just keep your opinions to yourself. KAREN: "Dear Karen. "I loved your drawings. "And I've got a secret friend too. "She is supposed to inspire me. "She's a pretty pink teddy bear. "But she gets lost. "So if you see her wandering around, "please keep an eye on her for me. "Her name's Karen too. Love Elvis." "I've looked all over the woods "and I can't find Karen, the other Karen. "I think you made her up. "You wouldn't have a pink teddy bear. "But I like it that you like to make things up too. "I do it a lot. "My friend, Monica, wants to know if you have a friend she can write to." Onward. Okay. Look what just came. Special delivery. Don't just sit there, open it. Come on, pull, pull. [LENA CHUCKLES] I'm exhausted. Good night. Good night. Love you. Don't stay up too late. Okay. I love you too. Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. [♪♪] Karen. Karen! Karen! [♪♪]
