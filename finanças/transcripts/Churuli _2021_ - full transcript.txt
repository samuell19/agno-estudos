Do you know who Perumadan is, Shajiva? He is a phantom who leads everyone astray. One day, a Monk decided to capture him. The Monk ventured into the forest With a basket on his head to carry the trapped Perumadan. A beautiful forest... Full of mysterious creatures... The Monk did not know his way. But the trees, animals, birds and plants... winked at each other... They knew him. The Monk had walked for long when he found a ball on the ground He picked it up and put it in his basket A gift for his children. Hours later, there was a sudden movement in the basket An anteater, rolled up like a ball, spoke from inside... O’Lord, slow down. The Monk was amused. He slowed down. Then the anteater said: Good Sir, head this way! The Monk obeyed. So the anteater said: Dear Lord, take that way! And he did. They say the Monk is still wandering in the forest... He hasn't yet realised... It’s the phantom who is sitting atop his head! CHURULI What’s my name from here on? Antony - And yours? - Sajivan - No. Sha-jivan. - Okay The name packs a punch! Shaji is the official name of scoundrels. We must go all out to pass off as lowlives! From today I’m not an ASI (Asst. Sub Inspector) and you’re not a PC (Police Constable) We’re just daily wagers. But don’t think you can act smart after we catch him! You better salute me whenever we cross paths! Yeah. Sir, how far is Bhadravati crossing from here? Sir, you speak the local language? - Who is a policeman from the Crime Squad? - Um... Never mind. What do policemen do? Police duty... Who really catches all the criminals? Officers like us who roam around in mufti. Not the ones at the station wearing uniforms and blowing whistles! They are just chowkidars (guards)! Cold... I’m cold... What’s special about you? Nothing. Once you mingle with common folk, you become one of them. Got me? Mmm Officers with striking looks... Like Chettiar... He could never do what we do! What about you, Sir? Don’t call me Sir! Stick to Antony Chettan! I’m not saying they recruited you because you look common. One needs to be capable. And have respect for the law. Sir, I always buy my ticket the minute I board. I don’t pull the PC card... That’s how you should be! The Late Basheer sir used to say: Secret Police must be like mongrels at a fish market. No one must notice us, but we must notice everything. Hello? Yeah. Have you eaten? Everything’s okay. I’m on the bus. I’ll call once I’m off. Poor signal... Okay. -Let’s go to that shop. -But people say... only losers and good-for-nothings are employed by the Crime Squad. That’s like blaming your wife for your handicap! - Right... -They didn’t want to relieve me from the Batheri Station. -Really? -SP sir said... “You’ve solved so many cases in uniform how many more will you solve without it?” Oh... Basheer Sir would capture five kilos of gold and only record three. - What, really? ! - Yeah. Come, let’s eat. Slow down, dude. The Chief said we can take our time. Sir, if we catch him soon we can go back quickly... Don’t dream of home and cuddling your wife when you set out for work! Don’t worry. Capable policemen never go long without action. That must be why you’re not married. - How much? - 45 - How do we get to Churuli? - Go up that way, there's a jeep. - Shall I pack a bottle of honey? - Nah, I’m diabetic! Hey Sasi, look at this! Two Americans were taken by aliens in their vehicle! How far? Churuli? We are trying to catch a man who is like a dog from hell. -So don’t say anything stupid, alright? - Mmm. He probably caught wind of us the minute we left home. He’s wily! But if he is a dog, our Chief’s a tiger, sir! I mean, Antony Chetta! Many have been on his trail... Capture him and show them, Shajiva! And stand up to those who mocked you for being a squad recruit! Yeah! Oh no... No one’s around... -Shajiva? -Yeah? This looks like a ride to hell! Oi! Ah! Come here, son! Is this the jeep to Churuli? A few more people are coming. We’ll leave soon. -Whom are you going to meet? -Err... To dig pits in a rubber plot... Belonging to... a Jose or Joy...? - It might be Thankan Chettan. - Right! He had leased out his old trees. Maybe he wants to plant new ones. Oh, that must be it, Shaji. But Thankan chettan has gone home... Where are you from? - Oh, he’s not around? - No. We are from Koorachundu, Kuttyadi. What do we do now, Shajiva? You’ve come all this way anyway. He should be back in a few days. What do we do till then? It's only a few days. You can find a place to stay. -Where... and money? -But we don’t know anyone there. So what, brothers? Just hop in! We’ll make a fun trip of it! Alright, let’s go... Good folks! Humble and polite... They have come far to farm and make an honest living... That scoundrel must have tricked them and settled here. He alway gives us the slip! Basheer sir caught him once. He still managed to escape. Humbug! The trouble is, we have no means to identify him. There’s no record of him even in the voters' list or ration card! - Don’t you have any vices? -Nah! - Not even alcohol? - No... Come, let's go! They are ready. - Coming! - Hop in from here! Sit closer. Let's go? - Whoa! This is a badass engine! -Yeah Wow! Such fertile soil! It must be very easy to farm here... especially yams! How's the rainfall here? If you get mid-season rains, you can grow plantains, too. All said and done, only our people... can come all this way, clear the forest and farm! Right? If the Brits hadn't come, all this would have remained a jungle, right? - You guys don't talk much, do you? - Yeah, I felt so too -Look! -It's a local temple. - Oh... Speed up, my boy! Right? Shift the gear and let her zip, son! I used to drive a timber truck through the Wayanad pass. This is nothing new! Oh, wow! He’s in great form now! Good going, man! Whoa! Lucky there's no glass! Or I would’ve smashed my skull! - Cross the bridge and wait. - Okay. - Antony chetta, I'm coming! - Just come! Come, dude! Take my hand. Careful... The bridge is weak. Even we can't walk on this... How will the jeep cross it? Careful, son! - Yes! Come on! Move forward! Slightly to the left! Just come! Stop, stop! Oh Lord! It's all slippery! Now come. Turn to the right a bit... Yes! To the right! Come on! Come on! Yes, keep moving! That's it! Done! Shajiva, come on! Whoa! You could drive over a hair strand, man! It's a wonder you’re still here! Why the hell are you piling on?! Get off, you asshole! You think they are all standing around for nothing? His frickin’ bag! Come Wait, wait! Get in, you motherfuckers! - What the hell are you staring at? - Yes, yes, we're coming! Get in you...!! Brushing against me! Move, you cretin! Seems like a different place shajiva. Did you fuck a buffalo on the way, you scumbag? Not a buffalo! I fucked your mother! Get the fuckoff you...! Move! (drunk mumbling) Hey! Fetch me something to eat, you scumbag! If you’re so hungry, bring your wife's thing you scumbag! I’ve brought you two fat eels! ♫ Fish... these angel fish swam free not long ago ♫ -What are you gawking at? - Never mind. -Shall I serve tapioca and fish curry? -Hold on. Give them some drinks first. - Sister! Two bottles here! - Let me give the thirsty ones some drinks! Can you get us some fish curry to go with it? Shall I serve some finely cooked monitor lizard? Move it, you dolt! I’m gonna feast! Holy cow, Shajiva! Why did you chug it if you don't drink?! Don't worry, it’s good stuff. Only some ammonia to ferment it quick. What? So you don't get toddy here? Will your dad come to tap toddy here, you bastard? Where did you find these fuckers? They are here to dig pits in Thankan chettan’s plot. They didn't know he’s away. Great. Guess I’ll have to take care of them now. A guy showed up last year I was broke by the time he left. I won’t mince my words, mind you! Suck it you scumbag! -What the heck do you want? -Some gravy. And more tapioca! -Hey -I'm coming! -Stir the meat curry. -I only have two hands! ♫ My family is joy, pure joy! ♫ ♫ Only in my family do I dance for joy! ♫ Hand it to me! Don’t you want anything? Get out of the kitchen, man! Half a bottle there! Just do what you’re told! -No one stays for free. You must work or I’ll work you! Why everyone is so silent? Sir, shouldn’t we report our arrival to the Chief? Is this a government office to report daily? Take a swig and enjoy your first night, you fool! Bet he’s been waiting since daybreak! Look at him run. See? You’re here! Pour me some! Go on! Quick! I’m sick of this loser. Open it! Cup your palms, idiot. -Yeah, that’s enough! -Some more! -I’ll carry it. -Yeah, bring it up. ♫ Clean by day, ride him by night ♫ Whoa! You’ve tidied up like a new bride! Everything looks spic and span! You will survive anywhere you go! You guys didn’t show and it’s past 11, so... That’s what the fellows who came earlier said too... Will you do everything women do? How’s the curry? Let me taste. Wow! But we can’t serve such tasty food here! Hand me the chilli. - Hold it -That's too much... Nah, it should burn your insides! Hey, do you butcher here daily? -Of course! -Really? -Head to the forest at night... -Okay Your dad and granny slaughter pigs there! - Stop blabbering, you buffoon! - Look at that! Wild game! Are you trying to finish this? What will we serve? - Right - Take it inside! Brother, how many families live in this area? Is he here to take the bloody census? Damn questions! Probably thinking of settling here if there’s enough work. Right? -Yeah -You can stay if you want, I’ll go! Hey, where is he? Drank and left? Yeah. He roamed the forest all night. Let him rest. - Are you horny or what? - I’ll smack you with my axe! Good god! Are you the CBI, you moron? Shut up, alright?! If he gets so much as a whiff, we’ll have to chase him across the country! How will we find him unless we know who’s around? -I don’t want to waste time. -We need to spend time! If you want to get home early, you better look for some other job! Noisy hunters don’t catch a thing! We must be discreet. I feel like we've been here for ages... Did you bribe your way into the force? Bloody homesick ninny! Does it take two to draw a pail of water?! People will be here soon. Come fetch the tapioca! You go, I’ll fill this. Faffing around as always... No sense of time! Vehicles rarely come this way... this path was cleared by foot. How long have you had electricity? A year and half, I think. - But you have it at the shop? - Yeah, but not yet at home. - Can we draw a line in the forest? - Why do you care? Ask sensible questions. Don't talk rubbish to make conversation! The forest is thick here. Oi! Where you off to? Kariacha! Off to trick people early in the morning? Off to deliver your mom's bastard, you cretin! -Such rascals all around! -And you know everyone? Oh, that’s because there are very few people here... So we horse around! Isn’t your name Philip? Why did he call you Karia? Did you sleep well last night? I fell asleep fine... but I woke up hearing noises. We have wild elephants here. - Elephants come out here? - Oh yes, they do. Isn't that dangerous? Nothing to fear... They wrecked my house twice. When they destroy, we build again! That’s all... Got it? Nothing to fear. Just swig a couple of stiff drinks and go to sleep, that’s all. Not sure what it was... But when I stepped out... I saw something like a fire-ball! Did you hear maybe a siren or an elephant trumpeting? - Yes, something like that! - Hmm... yeah. It’s the theechamundi (fire spirit) from the North hill going to the South hill. It’s the theechamundi (fire spirit) from the North Hill going to the South Hill. -Really?! -There’s an old church built by a foreigner Dedicated to Mother Mary... - Oh? - Yup! It’s the elder sister going to visit the younger one. Nothing else! The stories people make up! Shut up, you fool! I’ve seen it clearly! This close! What do you know? Come on now! I told you not to ask stupid questions. This is Channakkoova. Elephants eat them. See, this is the elephant trail They pass through here. We have to walk further. Please put it in here. - Hey, come and hold this! - Yeah. Why was he so brusque? He is a tight-ass. Not even rats can get to his tapioca! No one else lives there? He kicked two wives to death! He has a daughter, a real sexy chick! She’s old enough, but somehow he hasn’t married her off yet! Are you interested? Doesn’t he talk to anyone at the shop? - Better not talk to him! - Why? There was one Vasu here, two years ago. Two cops came in search of him. This scoundrel betrayed him. Do cops come here? What was the case against him? You scared of cops? - You guys here after some gang rape? - Oh, no! Don’t worry... The police won’t come here. And if they do, they wont leave in peace... It will be hard... This is no ordinary land, my son... Hey! Don’t you have any work besides eating and drinking? Why can't you go to Thankan's house and check? His wife must be home. Get going, you slowpoke! The plot where you’ll work is even further away. Let him get back! Fixing a deal is men’s work. Why don't we go there and check? We can start if she gives us the rate per pit. Why waste time? Get lost, you stinker! I'm not coming if there are only women. Why the hell can’t you go? Scared she’ll seduce you? Anyway, I'm going. Sister, what’s the real name of the shop owner? Hey, grandma! Who are you, boy? I’ve seen you around before... I'm from a bit far... I mean, why are you here? I came to dig pits in Thankan chettan’s plot. Have you finished your job? He is not here... Is there anyone from Iritti here? You’ll dig pits, is it? You’ll dig pits, eh? You dare come to Churuli to dig pits?! Since when are you the manager here, you halfwit? - Who’s senior, you or me? - You, sir. You are my subordinate, got it? - Someone might hear us, sir! - Nobody’s here! You bastard! Why did you go wandering? - Antony chetta... we... - Don't chetta me, you loser! Call me sir! You’ll call me sir when no one's around, alright? - What if I get confused and... - ​I’ll kill you if you mess up, scumbag! Get up, you idiot! Go and stand there. Salute me, let’s see! Do it! Now tell me. What did you gather from your excursion? Sir, everyone has false names here. All of them have 4-5 names. There’s no point enquiring about Joy. It could be any one of them. What did you expect? That you can just do a roll call and arrest the criminal?! If you ask me, we should bring a battalion of policemen with guns! Stay there and talk! We must arrest them all! Because they are all criminals! We’ll be credited for capturing a truck load of absconding criminals! - My boy, how long have you been in service? -5 years. I have 20 years of service, with 6 in the Crime Squad. Let me ask you something. Whom do we policemen interact with the most? - Who? - With criminals. And who gives us information about criminals? Other criminals! In other words, they are our bread and butter, dear Shajiva. So we shouldn’t catch them? No, my boy! The world is full of scumbags. We catch the scumbags we need, and others, we choose not to see! Take that bloody manager here. He’s a crook who vanished after his finance company went bust. I recognised him. But we don’t need him. Got it? So if you got the chance, you wouldn’t arrest Sukumara Kurup (notorious fugitive)? Get me some pickle! If I happen to meet Kurup, I’ll say: Dear Kurup bro, please escape! What’s the fun if you get caught? Everyone will forget you tomorrow. But if you don’t, these bastards will remember you for centuries! Did you hear something? -Did you get scared? - ​What the! Gossiping about criminals, eh? Are you plotting to kill me? If so, please tell me in advance! I forgot to tell you something... The shop will be closed for two days. It’s my kid’s First Communion. You can feast on meat and fish to your heart’s content! Motherfucker! Shajiva... Yeah... The toilet is merely a concept. How come, sir? - We’re pretending to be coolies, right? - Yeah Likewise, just pretend we’re invisible. That’s all! (Shajivan laughs) How will they conduct the Holy Communion here? Have you seen a church around here? I was wondering too... I haven't even seen a cross here, let alone a church! - Sir... - Yeah? We don’t have a single clue about Joy yet... - Dude! - Yeah? Don’t fret. This is a case many have tried and failed to solve... But I’ll share my experience. In such cases, you’ll feel disheartened till the very end... But at long last, a path will appear I have a feeling this First Communion is one such opportunity... - Hey! Put all that in the sack - Isn’t that what I’m doing?! No wonder they call you a sucker! Squeezing the bottle dry! My dear fellas, stop faffing and help clean up this place. We’ll have guests tomorrow. The place should be clean, right? We'll also join. Light some frankincense and air this place out... Let’s remove the stench of fish, meat and vomit from here. The Communion’s tomorrow and you’re cleaning the shop? We’ll take care of this. The shop’s closed for two days, right? - You head to the church. - Yeah, we’ll handle things here. -Come here, let me tell you something... -What is it? For the next couple of days, this will be our church! What? Look here! This is the altar! This is the sanctuary! Here, people can kneel, stand, do whatever... No issues! Come here. You too! - Make it fast! - ​Piss off! This area is for the priest and his assistant to change. -What do you think? - Nice... Know what this is? A closet for ... - Come! See that tree there? - Yeah?! If you hang a curtain from it, that becomes our store room. We must serve decent food to at least 75 people. Is it the toddy shop turned into a church? or the church turned into a toddy shop? Anyway there is a holy awakening! Around 70 people will be arriving right? Mightbe people from around. - Hey Kariacha, will everyone around here come? Everyone will come, including children. How about those not in good terms with you? Peace to all who come here! Go and get the work done. Don't faff! -Where are all the ladles? -See if there's enough light, you pricks! ♫ O’ traveller from Zion, crossing the seas ♫ ♫ Don't fear the waves! ♫ ♫ O’ traveller from Zion, crossing the seas ♫ ♫ Don't fear the waves! ♫ ♫ The one who commands the seas and winds ♫ ♫ Is on board with you ♫ - A vehicle is here. - Is that the Priest? -Yes, it's him. Father, praise the Lord! Hope the ride hasn’t tired you, Father. Father, praise the Lord. Watch your step, Father. We’ve arranged everything... Hey, make way for Father. (Benediction) Body and blood of Christ -Biju, take the rice! -Yeah And take lots of meat curry too. Where’s the vegetable dish, sister? Good curry, right? Have some more... Are you guys working at the toddyshop? We came to dig pits for rubber. Hey, bro! I haven't seen you people around, that's why... You live near by? I haven't seen you around, that's why... Hey Peter, give me some curry. Get some rice here! Some vegetable curry, bro. Pickles, anyone? Give me some more curry! Just a bit. - How's the food? - Good! -And the sides? -All good! This is how we all cook. Is it? We came to work here... Do you live in the toddy shop? Yes. Here itself. Have more curry... Let me know if anyone needs anything. Some more? Thank you very much, Father. Praise the Lord! -Right then, pastor! -Alright! -Whew, that's over! He was about to fall! Hey, Manicha! Where’s everyone? Manicha! Manicha! It’s under the jackfruit tree. Stop screaming and take it! - Where? - Under the jackfruit tree. Alright! Come.... - Where did he say it is? - Under the jackfruit tree. - That must be it! - Oh, yeah. - Shajiva! - Yeah? - He’s somewhere around here for sure... But we don't know anything besides his bloody name... Mayiladumparambil Joy! Then the informer must be from here too, right? Why can't that rascal just come say: Sir, there’s your Joy! We could easily arrest him! The informer’s probably laughing at our cat and mouse game now! Bloody asshole! Pour me one here! I have a wish... That thug who betrayed Joy... if he does exist, I want to meet him! He’s probably a criminal, too! Enough! Give it back! This is the life, my boy! I'm going to have some fun! Hey Avaracha! I'm coming along! -Sure, if you want to! -You leave. I’ll come in the morning. But don’t complain later that some leech bit you! - I’ll handle that! - Sir, one second. What will I do if Thankan comes now? - ​Put him in your panties, you loser! I last held a gun as a trainee 20 years ago... I want to shoot a man! But haven't even shot a mouse! - ​Today, I’ll kill a pig! - Go shoot a pig! What a jerk! Come on! I'll shoot a buffalo today! -Yeah, yeah... - I am so turned on! - ​Right, a buffalo is waiting for you with its tail up! - Gimme the gun! - Hold the sack! - The gun? - I'll hold it! Pick it up! Get lost! Go to hell! Piss off, sleazeballs! You look like a beanstalk... but you’re not half bad! - Hey George! - Yes! Come here. Here’s 500 bucks. Take it. You worked hard today! You work a lot. So keep it! Come here. Hand me the money. This is the rent for staying here. Now you owe me another 1000 for food and drink. You can collect that from Thankan when he gets here. They haven't returned yet... Probably stamped to death by some elephant. In a couple of days the women will come say something stinks. And you can collect his bits in a sack and let me know, alright? Go sleep! Then one of the elders asked me Who are these dressed in white robes ? Where do they come from? And I said to him: My Lord, you know. And he said to me: They come from the great tribulation. They have washed their robes in the blood of the Lamb, and made them white. Therefore, they stand before the throne of God And serve him day and night in his temple. (Music) It's stinking... Scoundrels bury corpses here! Hey! It’s noon! Where are those stinkers? What about your boss? Bloody Thankan, where is he? He should have returned in 4-5 days! Must have gone behind some whore. Has he been picked up by the police or what? Why would the police catch him? Does anyone who hasn’t screwed up come here, you halfwit? How many times will the two of you show up to dig the damn pits?! You jinxed us, you fool! Twitching like a bird! Damn. I’ll shove this gun up your ass! Stop gawking! Just walk! You son of a bitch! I lost three days thanks to you, dimwit! -Don’t dare come here again, you dog! - But what did I do? Nothing at all! Why the heck did you come with me? Why did you go with him, idiot? What the fuck should I cook instead of meat, you loser? Kariacha, I... This loser wanted to hold the gun! Here, take mine! Locked and loaded! Move! You’ll catch nothing if you take along duds like him! -I’ll bust your nuts, bastard! -Go back inside! Get lost, all of you! Leery idiots! Look at his bloody face! I’ll kick you so hard... Hey, hey! That’s enough you dickhead. To think I’m back in this damn arrack shop thanks to a mere constable! On the plus side... We know he’s not our Joy. Are you sure? Yeah! He’s from Irikkoor. Chased off for harassing a neighbour's cow! Sir, when I went to the tapioca guy's place... What is it? Why did you stop? What if our Chief was wrong? What if Mayiladankutti Joy is not here? No, dude... I’ve been tracking such people for years now, haven’t I? He is here... I can smell him. - Who are you? - Came for work. - At the liquor shop? - No, to dig pits for rubber. - What's your name? - Shajivan. - What? - Shajivan! Doesn’t have a good ring to it! He’s from Kodagu. Usually brews his own liquor. Drops by occasionally... Who are these stinkers? Workers... here to dig rubber pits for Thankan. They look bloody messed up! He’s not around... So they are staying here. They look fishy! He’s a scumbag. Reads people at first sight... -Antony brother - Yes -Be careful -It's okay. Walk. -Do you have any idea that howlong we have been here? - I dont know Even I dont have any clue. Even we natives, have no clue about it. Walk fast. We need to cross the hills (Kannada Extempore) (Crowd cheers) Sit closer! Ready, 1,2,3... start! You go first! Don't fall. Slap! (Audience claps) Mystical beings from the sky go around the Earth -For you at the back! - Don’t push, you jerk! When will I get mine? Hey, Kariacha! Let’s go to the slapping competition! Keep an eye on everything. I'm going there. Slap him! Slap him hard, you weakling! Move aside! Kariacha, come! Slap him! Come on! Come here, you! -You! Yes, you! - Me? No way! -No! -It will be alright! You just have to sit there! I have no idea, please! Leave me alone! I don't want to! I’ll bet on him! 100 rupees! Slap the hell out of him, man! Slap! This is nothing! Who do you think my boy is! Shajiva, make us proud! 1,2,3... start! Come on! Slap him! Smack him to pulp! Hit him! Slap him, man! What the...! Slap him, you stinker! A tight slap! Slap him! Slap him hard! Dare mess with us?! Shajiva! Shajiva? Hey, Shajiva... Hello? Where did he go in the dark? Hey, Shajiva! - Where’s your husband? - No idea. He took money from me. Said he’d get me something from the city. Must be wandering somewhere! He just sleeps, drinks and roams the forest at night! - Did Annan come here? - Let him come. I’ll talk to him. - Ask him. - Hey, did Annan come here? He left after two bottles as usual. Didn't you meet? I went home early. Haven’t seen him. We don't know. He might be lying somewhere drunk! Look around! Who knows where he went? Go and check. Man, he seems to be missing! Looks like it’s risky to mess with you, eh? Hey! - Where did you go last night? -Where would I go? Bastard! Don’t lie! You weren’t there when I woke up! Bullshit! You must have dreamt! I slept like a log! I woke up only in the morning. Hey! Fuck! Three’s a crowd, you boneheads! - Hey, Shajiva! - What? -Do you know how to shoot? - We’re not leaving... until we chuck a sack of fresh meat at their faces! That’s the dream, man! When I read reports of poachers caught by forest guards... I get such a thrill! You must hunt wild game and snag a woman to call yourself a man Will you shut up? There’s only one rule in the forest... One person talks, others obey! Keep blabbering and we’ll catch nothing! Did you hear that? It's him! Who...? - Him... The Black Monster! - Oh! Don't worry, he despises us. Point the light, dude! -It must be a leech. - Oh God! A leech! - It hurts! - I asked you to put on repellent! - Stand still, you fool! - Gently, please... Gently! - Light it on fire! - No, don't! Shut up! What did you think bit you?! -There, it's gone! -Now walk! Shajiva, where are you going? Have you been here before? All forests are the same... They lie coiled up... like a snake. So don’t step on one. -See, he knows what’s what! - Right... Don’t talk. And hold your breath too. Got it? Come sit here. It's fricking cold! My legs are cramping... Basheer Sir used to say... One must hunt wild game and snag a woman to become a real man! Shhh! Shajiva! It's down! You shot him down! Man! I sprained my back! - Hey, Shajiva! Take a look! - Make way! Got him! Draw the knife down! Close to the ribs! - Cut the liver first! - Piss off, man! -I’ll go home after this, alright? -Mmm Come back on your own with the invalid! Hey Avaracha, we’re coming too! Please stop! We’re also coming! Hey, come this way! (Groaning) Hey! Over there! The sound came from there! Up here! There! Come, let's go there! It's there! - Wasn’t it over there? - No, the other way! Come! Hey, where are you stinkers? Come here! - Where the hell are you? - Was it over there? Dude! Stop! I guess the road ends here... Have I gone blind? Can't see anything! - How will we get out? - Shut up! Let's walk back. Hold me! I see a light there! Let's go! Man... Will we die here? Turn the torch on! The battery is dead, dude! Can't see anything... Look, there's a light! - Come, walk! - Yeah... HEY! HELLO? Is anyone around? Please someone come! HEY! (Antony whimpering) Oh, Lord! Ow! (Chanting) (Antony crying) Aren’t we there yet? Come this way. -Bring it down! -Gently! Please! - Please! Careful... - I asked you to shut up! Go and call her, man. Please ask her to see me! Sister! Sister...? Who the hell is screaming there? She heard us! Who is this scumbag? Can you have a look at his spine? Please treat me! Please... Useless vermin! Good for nothing. (Antony howling) The spine is sprained. Needs a good massage. Or he’ll be nothing more than a useless vegetable. -Do you have money? - I do. What are you all gawking at? Get lost, all of you! Let’s go... She wants them to herself! This isn’t too bad... She let those other guys off only after 4 days! Omanakutta! Please come and take a look! Shut up, you cry baby! Didn't she say she’ll fix it? -Please ask her to come! - Sister, could you please take a look? Yeah, coming... Oh God... Who are you, boy? You look very familiar... I don't know. You don't know! He’s with me. We are together. Oh, you’re together? I don't allow such men here. Piss off! No, Sister! He’s not that kinda guy! He came with me for work. Can you just please take a look? Okay. Remove his clothes, leave the loin cloth on and get him in. Let me have a look. Ow! Ow! A curious place... Isn’t it, Shajiva? I’ve just applied the oil. Treatment will take all night. You can leave at dawn. Sleep in the other room. There's food in the kitchen. Don't finish it off! There’s a kid here. Stop it! Please try not to hurt me, Sister! Everything will be fine in a flash. Let the medicine boil. Who is he? Your servant? Nah, son of a distant relative. The family is poor, so he’s here. He’s really naughty. Better keep an eye on him. (Chanting) Sister! I feel better than ever! Now I can play around as I please! - Is that right? - Yeah! Sir, you’re a policeman, right? How did you know? I can tell... You can tell from what you do? I can guess a man's job, his birthplace... even predict his future! -Shall I? -Nah! Shall I? Shall I? Shajiva, I had a revelation when my back was sprained! -We have met everyone here, right? -Mmm None of them’s our man. So it must be the guy who’s stayed out of sight. He’s the one! I’m sure. What if he knows we are here and doesn’t come back? -Nah! He wouldn’t dare... -Hey, stop there! Stop! Son of a whore! Bastard! What the hell did you do to the boy last night? -What the hell did you do to him? -What is she saying?! And sneaking off shamelessly without paying a penny! Scoundrel! I did nothing, Sister! Listen to this dirty rascal! Fooling with a little boy, you creep? -Hey Sister! What are you doing? -Pretending to know nothing! Let go! Leave him! We’ll sort this out. -Give me that! -Bastard! -Here, 1000 bucks. Take it. Leave, man! Hey, Sister! Wait up! (Indistinct conversation) Mani... Mani? Hey! Aren’t you married? Then why the hell did you...? Didn't I say I didn't do anything? Never mind. We sorted it out with just 1000 rupees here. Back home, you’d be booked for child abuse. And lakhs in penalty! She wasn’t just massaging you last night, was she?! Thankan, been a while since we last saw you... Where have you been? Hey Thankan bro, I forgot to mention. Two lowlives have come to dig rubber pits in your plot! They’ve been working and lodging at the liquor shop. Seem like real losers! But I’m not planting rubber. Why would I dig pits? (Scuffle) Oh, you’re here! Who were you whoring around with all this while? - Where are they? - Who? Ah, they’ve gone somewhere to shit! Will come soon. Why do you let random dudes stay here in my name? What sort of a question is that? It’s not the first time people have stayed in your name, is it? Haven't they come to dig rubber pits for you? What the hell?! Don’t you know I've leased my plot? It’s not me! He brought them! You thug! Why the fuck do you bring random assholes here? Hey Thanka! Don't make me call you names, you filthy dog! Let’s see you dare, you motherfucker! Piss off, dick! - What did they say? - You tell me! They came for you! No one here knows them! You tell us! Didn't you bring them? Answer, you scumbag! Who are they? Tell me! Thanka, get off! All of us here are crooks! So don't bloody pick a fight! We’ll kill you, bastard! Stop it, you scoundrels! Don't you dare mess with my husband in the name of some thugs! I’ll cut you all to pieces fuckers! They are coming. Ask them! Cretins! No one speak. I’ll ask them. You stay mum. -I think they know something... -Mmm Don't say anything dumb. -Just play along. -Mmm Who are you, scumbags? We came to dig pits in Thankan’s plot... Thankan's ass! Who are you? -We were called to dig pits... -By whom? - To dig pits... - Where the fuck did you dig your pits? - We got a call... - Why did you come here, scumbags? - Called to dig pits... - Who the fuck called? Do you know Thankan? - It's Thankan who... - I’m Thankan, you filthy motherfuckers! Have we met? - We were at Koorachund... Got a call... - Up yours ass! Have you seen me before? Do you know me? -We don't know you... But... -Why the hell are you here then? Who’s with you, tell me! Son, don’t you know...? We came... Know what? -We did come to dig pits... -Up your...! Who’s with you? How many? But what’s the problem, brother? We don’t understand... Tell him, Kariacha! Shut up, you motherfuckers! bastards! I don’t frickin’ know these scumbags! Aren’t we talking to you? Tell us! Speak up, bastard! What did you come here for? Tell us now! Messing with Thankan, eh? Scoundrels! Hey, Thanka! Shut up! Let's not delay any further. Let's finish them off! - What will we do with the bodies? - I can't dig pits! Right. What if the dogs dig it up? Shall we burn them in sugar? We don't have a ration shop to get enough sugar! Shall we beat them to pulp and throw them in the river? Let's not waste time. It's easier if we cut them to pieces! Why debate so hard to kill someone? Chuck them into the compost pit, and bury them deep! It will be good for the coffee there! Finish soon and come back. We need to make the evening curry. Move aside, you hoodlums! -They’ve got a gun! -Catch him! -Move, move! -Easy, easy! -Come here, you! -Look here... - What's your real name? - Thankan! You twat, we didn't come to dig pits in your cunts! We are Kerala Police, you dimwit! What's your real name? - Thankan. Thankachan! - Then who is Mayiladumkunnu Joy? That's not my family name. Mine is Mayiladumpara! Here... You’ll chop us up and burn us in sugar, eh?! you fucker! We are just villagers! We thought you were thieves. Would we really do that?! We were just trying to get to the truth! - Move! - Where is this Joy? Joy is at home, Sir! Walk, you bastard! Hey Karia scumbag! I’ll be coming for you later! If you come close I’ll bust your guts, you cretins! Don’t you dare! Don’t even think of tricking us! This bullet can go far, alright? I don’t see him! The rascal knows his way around. He has escaped! Hey you! There he is! Piece of shit! Think you can give us the slip? My dear Sir, where would I go even if I tried? I'm not the one you’re looking for... Just walk! Sir, don't get lost here... This is a treacherous place. Isn't there a road to your place? I don't have the money for that, Sir. We came from Karikottukara after my parents died... Bought some land, did some farming... Hey, hey! If we ask about the road, stick to that! I don't want to know your frickin’ history! Is it your army following you? Are you tired, Sir? Just a little further. Just walk! - Only a little further... - Just walk! -Stop! They are taking that way. Let’s take the shortcut. Sir, it's very slippery! Careful. - Yeah, yeah! What are you doing? -Hey! -Just washing my face, gentlemen! Don't act smart! Let's take this short cut. This way... Why the heck are they following us? There they go! Come on! When I turned to see the voice that spoke to me, I saw seven golden lampstands. And among the lampstands was one, like the Son of Man. He was clothed to his feet... What’s going on, dear? - They’ve come to see Joy... - Shut up! - What's his name? - Thankan... Then who is Joy? He is my brother, Sir... Where is he? - Unwell... - What? He is unwell... He’s paralysed, Sir... Joy, you must have understood the situation... Enough of this act. It's time to face the law. Get up! Sir, I've been lying this way for a year. My life runs on medication now... What’s the charge on him, Sir? What will you do with this paralysed man anyway? Ah! Sister, he’s done enough to get around 10 years in jail! Poaching endangered wildlife... And messing around with young boys! Sir, it’s true there are some petty cases against me... But the rest were pinned on me by the police and the Forest Officers. Take pity on me, Sir... If you take me in this state, I’ll die there, Sir... He’s harmless, Sir... Please help us in some way... Please show some mercy, Sir... Whether you’re dead or paralysed, you’ll be presented before court tomorrow! There are doctors and nurses in prison too. So you’ll take him, will you? Scumbags! Let them try, I dare you scumbags! Brother Philip, they say they want to take our Joy with them. We were wondering too... How will they take him? Move aside! Ah, they have shot me... - Hey Itticha? Itticha! - What is it? Come here! They were playing with the gun and I lost a piece of my ear! What is it, dear? -They’ve come all this way to take me. Let them... (Laughter) What's so funny? Nothing, Sir! Just laughing over an old story. Shall I narrate the story, Sir? Of the Monk and the Madan? Madan and malarkey! Fine, I’ll tell you another story, Sir! Of a policeman who once came to catch me And one about another policeman. And one before that too! What’s this, a fricking loop? A long, long time ago! Forever ago! Just tell the story. The policeman picked up a guy on his way. For company. - The Monk... - Monk? No, the policeman arrived. You think their costumes fooled us? We pretended we knew nothing... Winked at each other... We were curious to see. How far they would go. It’s fun watching the same story unfold over and over Shajiva! I think we’ve lost our way... Haven't seen that bridge yet. Fuck! I have no clue either! Sir, we can go this way. Though it is a bit longer and winding... You could have told us earlier, you scumbag! Then?! The duo settled, eating and drinking their fill. They put on fat - eating wild meat and drinking arrack! What's lacking here, Sir? There are enough whores... Need more? We have other options too... Right? Want to kill someone? You can do that too... No questions asked. Isn’t this paradise, Sir? Is there anyone who hasn’t killed or raped at least in their mind? He grew to love the forest, the mist and the cold... Even forgot he was a policeman! He lost his way... Finally, when it was time, we asked them: Who the hell are you?! He began to recall... Then, the Monk, er, the policeman decides to catch me! He even had a toy-like gun! We found it hilarious! My dear Joy, we know your history! That's why we’ve tied your paralysed hands. Sir, if that’s so, just imagine that... I’m miraculously cured! Aha! Then? And imagine I untied myself... and sat straight! Wow! And then...? Huh?!
