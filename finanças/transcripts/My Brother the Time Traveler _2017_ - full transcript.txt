- Hey, bro, got my battery. No! - Easy, easy. I'm Dr. Murphy, hypnosis. You were hypnotized. You were in deep. I hypnotized you. Okay, now come out of it slowly. Hypnosis. Maclain, now you said while you were under that your parents were frozen to death. Is that right? - Died in a car accident. It's my dreams, they die in all sorts of different ways. Sometimes they're on fire. Sometimes they're drowning. - Uh-huh. - Last time they were falling off a cliff and I can't do anything about it. And then he's there every time filming the whole thing. - Ah, he, your brother, right? Mm-hm, mm-hm. - Yes, It's quite frustrating, so. Mm-hm, mm-hm. - If you can tell me what I need to know to get rid of them, that'd be great. - Mm. Mm-hm, mm-hm. Mm-hm. - I'm sorry, do you want me to keep talking? I kinda got to the end of my thought there. - Oh, oh, okay, okay okay okay. So, so, so, so you have a dream, uh, that you can't interpret, so you're wondering what that means. So let me explain, okay. Now dreams, right, are, come from the brain, right. Your brain goes to sleep and you create these dreams. Now dreams, uh, even though the brain is creating them, the brain can't actually do the things that you're dreaming about. You understand that, right? So, so really what it comes down to, there's a famous hypnotherapist. His name is Jonathan Mayer. He described the body as being a wonderland. And what I need you to understand about dreams is that when. Oh you're not following me. Let, let, let me simplify this a little bit more. Dreams are, hm, not real. Does that make sense? - Yeah, I'm aware that dreams are not real, okay? I just want them to end because my parents have been gone for over 15 years. - Okay, now now now now this is just me, just a hunch, but maybe, uh, you know, your dreams are not about your parents as much as they are about, um, hm, your brother. - My brother. - Yes. He, he's, the, the delusional one. - Yes. - You, you, you said, right? - Okay, they're not about my brother. - Okay, mm-hm, mm-hm. Okay, but he's the only one in the dream that's alive other than you, right, so. - Well he's dead to me. Okay. - He's been-- - Ah, ah. Dead to you, right? Okay, right? - He's pretty much the worst brother you could ever ask for. Mm-hm. - After my parents died, he decided to go crazy and leave me with all the aftermath, so no. - Mm-hm. - It's not about him, even though he tries to make everything about him. - Mm-hm. Mm-hm, mm-hmm, mm-hmm. - Is that all you do is sit there and mm-hm, mm-hm? - Okay, this is good. Now tell me how this makes you feel? - You are the worst, man. - Now, now, now, now, not to call you out on something, but how could I be the worst, when you just said your brother is the worst, right? We can't both share that title, right? Which leads me to my next point, which is that maybe, uh, you know, your issues here are with your brother that you're just not facing, and you instead are projecting, you know, um, your anger on me. - What I'm currently trying to wrap my brain around is how in the world my wife convinced me to sit here and do this. - Now now now now now try to use I feel statements, I feel this, I feel that. - I feel like you're an idiot! - Aha, okay. - I feel like this is a complete waste of time, waste of money. - Mm-hm. - And I also feel that you look like a weasel. - Hm. - Actually, no, a ferret. You have a tiny ferret's head on an abnormally large trunk and tiny little baby legs. - Okay, now I feel maybe you should make amends with your brother and then the dreams will go away. - What are you doing? Oh man. Hello! How are you? Fine, thank you, how are you? Good that you're polite. Do you know what time it is? Yes, it's, oh fudge, I'm late. Goodbye little guy. You're free. - Hey babe, I was just calling to see how your session with. I hope well. I'm out running a few errands, so I'll be home a little bit later, okay. Alright, love you, bye. - Jake? - Clare. - Oh my gosh. I can't believe it's really you. - No, what are you doing? How do you know it's really me? Can't just open the door like that. - Well, you have Maclain's eyes. And also I've seen a lot of pictures of you and you haven't really changed that much. - That's a joke. - Come in. - Alright, I'll buy it. You can't be too careful. There's lots of crazies going on. You just can't open your door for strangers, you know? - Amen. - Oh, were you saying a prayer? Should I have? - No, I was agreeing with you. - Oh. - It's so nice to finally meet you. - I know, it's nice to meet you too. I feel like I've already known you for forever. - Me too. - Yeah, that's how the best it is. I agree. - Yeah. So, what made you contact me? - You contacted me. - That was the last test. You passed, you are the true Clare. - I know, it's me. Oh man, that's so fun. - This is quite the meeting spot. - Oh yeah, I like nice and secluded it is. In fact, one could almost murder one and one would never know. - Yeah. - Just kidding. So what do you say, sis-in-law? - I don't know. It's just he's been on edge lately. We're having some personal problems, and also he's been having these terrible nightmares. So I just don't know if the timing's right. - That's what I thought at first too, but then I remember that we had the best time at Christmas. So I decided what better timing, right? - Well, what about this? What if you call him right now and you ask him? Then maybe he'll agree to it. - I think we both know what he'll say. Well, this was gonna be fun, but you seem very nice. I was looking forward to getting to know you guys again. And you again, for the first time. - Well wait. - Take it easy. - Wait, Jake, Jake. Huh? - Okay, I don't feel comfortable lying to him, but what if you happen to show up at the family cabin that we're going to be at all weekend long? - I see. I'll happen to be there maybe. You don't know this, but you just made the best decision of your life. Good luck getting out of here. - Bye. See you soon. Maclain? - I'm in here. - Hey. - Hey. - So, how was it? Was he so good? - Actually he was insane. Complete waste of money and a total quack. - What? - Yeah. - But. That's so weird, he was so highly recommended. - I knew it was a bad idea. I don't need a therapist. I just need to bury this like normal people do. - I mean, he didn't have any good points? - Not one. He said he thinks my dreams stem from issues with my brother. - That's interesting. - Yeah, he said that maybe I should try reconnecting with him, that it might help me leave the past in the past. - Maybe he's right. I mean, maybe you've been feeling bad because your relationship with him is so broken. - First of all, he's the one that broke the relationship when he went full crazy on me and when he abandoned me, okay? And second of all, why are you taking the side of some hypno bullcrap artist. - Because it actually makes sense and maybe he can make you feel better. - I feel great. Actually, I feel wonderful. - But secretly, deep down, don't you wish you could fix things with him? I mean, maybe he's super nice and likable and isn't Christmas the perfect time for that? - This is completely insane. - You don't have to be rude. - No, check out this last minute travel deal I got. - No, no, no, no, we're not going to Fiji for Christmas. - You said I needed something new. Maybe this is a sign. - The universe does not send Groupon text alerts as signs. - Well, I want you to imagine one thing. You and me on a romantic beach on Christmas Eve. Come on, doesn't that sound romantic? I mean, the cabin, it's so blah. - Cabin is not blah. The cabin is the most Christmasy place ever and Fiji is like the least Christmasy place ever. - Okay, but I just want something different, you know? Let's start a new tradition, me and you. - No, a tradition is something you do every year. You don't just start a new tradition willy billy. - Willy billy? This is perfect. Your parents are off cruising the Mediterranean. Your brother's are with their in-laws this year. We can just go off, you and I. - I'm telling you, I have a really special feeling about this year. I think it's going to be amazing. I might even have a special surprise. - Let's just do your surprise right now. - No, we're going to the cabin and it's going to be the most Christmasy Christmas ever and you're going to be happy about it, okay? - Christmasy is not a word. - Maybe not but Scrooge is. - Actually that's a name, so. - Okay. - Come on. You don't have to be the Christmas bully? - Really? - Okay, fine, you're not the Christmas bully. You're just like a disgruntled elf or something. - Mm-hm. - Alright, we'll do it. We'll go to the cabin this year. And maybe next year we'll have an enjoyable Christmas. - Cool, see you next year. See, look at these clouds. I'm worried about this storm coming up. I think we'll be okay. - What I'm worried about more than this storm is what is my big surprise gonna be? Is it a baby deer that I get to raise to be a buck? - You're dumb. - How about this, is it a cardboard cutout of Carl Weathers eating chicken parm? - Ew, no. - I am going to keep trying until I get it right. - Okay. - Is it a North Korean pen pal? A Britney Spears Chia head? A self-cleaning churro machine? King Triton's trident? Aladdin's lamp? Cave of wonders? All the treasures? The thing-ma-bob? A jingle-hopper? The head of Monrovian diplomat? The heart of gypsy? Would you please stop talking? - It's the heart of a gypsy. I can tell. - Okay, you really want me to tell you? - Yes, I do. - Okay, this is a pretty big surprise. So, are you sure you're ready? - Lay it on me. Why did you think this was a good idea? - Your therapist, all the podcasts I listen to, Tony Robbins says this is suppose to be good. - He says to bring a crazy person into your home? - Crazy? I mean look at him. He looks completely harmless. - Yeah, he may harmless and cozy and soft, but guess what? He thinks he's a time traveler. - Well I think that's cool and I'd like to get to know your time traveling brother. So I say he's staying. - What makes you be the one who decides? - I mean, come on, Maclain. He's not some homeless man off the side of the street. You're being irrational. - I'm being irrational? You're the one who wanted to bring him here. We should've brought him to an ER. He needs professional help. - Actually I'm okay. I'm alright. The tent actually took the brunt of the hit. - Oh my gosh, he lives in a tent. You can not kick him out. This is what he does. He's doing it to you now. - I'm sensing a lot of weird energy from. - No, no, no, no. Maclain, he was just saying how excited he is to have you here. - No, I was saying let's not get excited because Jake probably has to leave. - No, no, you were saying you can't wait to catch up and reconnect with your estranged brother. - No, I thought it was strange that my brother came here to our cabin after 15 years. - No, no, you straight up said, oh, I'm so happy to have our brother here at our family cabin. What a great Christmas surprise. - No, Jake, this is what I said. I said, you and I both know this is probably a really bad idea. So you should just. - Yeah, I should probably, probably go, yeah. I miss this place. Ouch, ouch. But I'm gonna go. I'm just gonna head out. Really get to a trusted InstaCare facility. One with a decent concussion protocol. Your Pruis, it was a, it popped me good. - Jake, wait. - No. - I should probably actually get the ER. It's a billboard that said there's only a 28 minute wait. I'll be fine, don't worry. I'm gonna get there before all the internal bleeding. I'll be fine by myself. Oh, my shoulders. - No, I'm gonna take you. - No. Just let me get my boots on. - I don't want you driving out there. - Oh, we'll be fine. - You don't know that. The roads could be bad. - Well, clearly he can't walk down there. So what's your solution? - Jake, just. - What, Maclain? - Shut the door so you can hear me. - What? - You can stay here tonight and you're welcome to leave first thing in the morning. - Serious? That's perfect. - Great. - Great, that's great. Are you hungry? I'm starving, Clare. I got hit by a car. I'll make you a sandwich. - Yeah, no mustard. - Okay, yeah. - Can we get a puzzle, Mac? - You can do a puzzle with Clare. I am going to get firewood for Mr. Clark. - The taxidermy guy? No offense but why doesn't he get it himself? - I don't know, maybe 'cause he's paralyzed from the waist down. Wouldn't you know that? Or maybe you were off at the Gettysburg address. - Yeah right. I was probably somewhere way cooler. Well, I don't want you to go alone. I'll go with you. - I'm fine. - What if you get lost and you have to sleep inside a dead horse? How come my logs feel like they're way heavier than yours? I feel like mine are heavier than yours. - Mr. Clark, do you need help? No, I got it. Stay right there, guys. I'll be right with you. We brought you some firewood. - Hey Mr. Clark. Do you want? - Oh, hey, it's the Bernard brothers. Hi guys, give me one second here and grab the door. Okay, oh gravy. Oh gravy. I got it, I got it. - Do you want? - Gimme. Gimme one second. Okay, oh, you little stinker. Okay, come on, I'm almost there. Come on. - Well, just shut. - Oh thank you. - Oh, I am so sorry. Are you cold? - Oh, good gracious. - You look really cold. - No, I'm fine. I'm not deaf, I'm just paralyzed. - Okay. - I'm great. - I'm sorry. - No, that is just fine. I haven't had any tingles in my jingles since the accident. That's you, Jake. I didn't even recognize. Well, how you been? - How are you doing? - Oh, you know, I can't complain except for my severed spine. But other than that, I'm doing real great. - Great. - I'd invite you all in for some cocoa, but I'm been skinning a momma moose in there. It's like a real crime scene. - That's okay, we just wanted to drop by the firewood and say hello. - And spread a little Christmas cheer. - Oh, that's real great of you guys. I appreciate it so much. Why don't you two sing that Christmas song y'all use to sing to me every Christmas? - I don't know if we remember it. - Yes, come on, sing it. - We don't have the right key. I just, we're gonna be bad. - Well, alright. I mean, if you don't wanna sing it, you don't have to, but it would sure put a lot of feeling back into my useless spine. Remind me of some simpler times. Times when I didn't have to use the internet to get a carpus. I could just go out there and see a moose and kill him with my own hands. And just act like Samson, you know? Slaying the lions with the jawbone of his ass. You know, blood just doesn't feel the same on my fingertips if I don't shed it my-- ♪ Away in a manger ♪ No crib for a bed ♪ The little Lord Jesus lay down his sweet head ♪ ♪ The stars in the heaven looked down where he lay ♪ ♪ The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay ♪ ♪ Asleep on the hay Well, thank you, boys. That, that was real nice. It sure good to see you two are still thick as thieves. Your parents would be so proud of you, you know? God rest 'em. They was just the best. I sure appreciate you guys coming out here and visiting an old cripple for Christmas. You know, Christmas is a hard time when you're living by yourself, you know? And you don't have any family and you're just thinking about family and you just sit quietly by a candle and you put on jammies and sit by the fire and think about doing a puzzle. Sometimes I draw pictures of my family on the wall and I think, well, these are the people that love me and they really can't love me, can they? And I kiss 'em and hug 'em and cry. - Good, okay. Can we just put it? - Oh, let me, I got that. Can I just leave it there? - Sure. - Merry Christmas. - Bye. - Merry Christmas. - Yeah, sometimes I just I think about people that would love to be around me at Christmas time. It's just that time of year - Okay, okay. - Where I would love to hear something warm and happy, you know? Simpler times, really thinking about times when I didn't have to go on the internet to get a-- Hey. - Hey. - Clare said to give you this. - Oh, thanks. - Don't use up all the hot water. - Hey, you wanna blow some ships up? - No, I'm pretty tired. I'm gonna go to bed. - Come on, one game before I leave in the morning? It'd be fun. That was really cool that made me help Mr. Clark today. I like that. - I didn't make you do anything. - No, but you're always good at being nice to people and I guess I just forgot that. - I can't believe you remembered that harmony. - I will never forget that. Anyways, it's kinda ironic that both showed up at the cabin at the same time, right? - No, that's coincidence. - What? - Irony would be like, in this game if you always put your ships in the middle even though you lost every time you did that. Coming here after 15 years and seeing me, that's just coincidence. - Yeah, I guess so. I forgot how you're always so smart. - So, are you ready to go? - Just give me a second, okay? If this is my last game with you, then I wanna make it special. - It's gonna be a long weekend. Probably have time for a rematch. - Oh, I thought I was leaving in the morning. Well, I decided that you can stay through Christmas. - Are you serious? That is awesome. - Well this isn't for you. And it's not for me, it's for Clare. We're gonna do it for her. - Let's do it for her. You gotta give 'em what they want. Women are crazy like that, right? - Promise me you're going to be normal. - The normalest. Yes, Bernard family style, yeah. Babe, that's awesome. I think that's really cool - But you have to promise me one thing. If his weirdness gets too weird, you have to back me up. - I can't imagine that happening. - Give him time. - Apparently he has all the time in the world. - You know what? - What, you didn't even laugh at my joke. - It's hilarious, I know but guess what? It's like really embarrassing that he brings that up all the time. - More embarrassing than this little situation happening over here. - I've lost 15 pounds since I started working out with Reggie. - Okay, but promise me one thing. - What? - Promise that you will never ever lose these little love handles right here. - Okay, okay, that's just rude. - I'm serious, I love 'em. - Then prove it. Come here. - Babe, your brother is in the other room. - Who's fault is that? Hey, I'll be quiet if you will. Hey, get a room you guys. - How long have you been standing there? - No worry, I didn't hear anything. I just was wondering do you guys have any other ice cream? This one looks like the ice planet, Hoth. - We don't, I'm sorry. But I can go into town tomorrow and grab some. - Okay, just wanted to check and see. - Okay, alright. Good night. - Thanks, good night. Jake. - Yes? - You wanna shut the door? - I do want to but you guys have a thermostat in here and if it gets too chilly out there, I don't wanna creak the door and wake you guys up. I'll just leave it open and I can just come in. - Yeah, of course, leave the door open. No big deal. Okay, thank you, Clare. - Yeah. - Yeah, thank you, Clare. - Thanks, okay. Alright, I'm just out there on that sofa that you built into a bed, right? - Yeah, is that okay? - Great, that's great. The bar in the middle of the back one. - You wanna sleep in the attic? - No, I don't. It's gonna be good. Thank you so much, it's gonna be fun. Okay, I'll see you guys in the morning. - Alright, see you in the morning. - We're gonna have a good time. - Yeah. He's so nice. I'm really tired. - Clare? - Get your boots on. What's going on? - Hurry up. - Dude, what's happening? - You're gonna need this. Go! Help, help us! Help us, Maclain! Oh please, help us. This thing is gonna get us. - What are you gonna do, bro?

Did you invent a machine or? - Clare, I can't even open a package of Oreos without destroying it. You think I'm gonna invent a time machine? - I didn't know. No, no way. It's all about my body temperature. - Really? Yeah. - How does that work? - Well, since you asked, it all started after the accident, the one where my mom and dad got. - Yeah. - Killed. - Yeah, I know. - In the car accident. I was in coma in the hospital and one night this idiot nurse named Darrel accidentally flipped off the heater in my room. I was balls cold. - Oh gosh. - But I couldn't press the call button 'cause I was in a coma. So I just had imagine somewhere super warm. Next thing you know I'm in 12th century B.C. Egypt under the reign of Ramesses the third. - Really? - Yeah, it was crazy. It was fun, very fun at first. - Wow. - I was sunbathing in the Nile. - Yeah. - I was hanging out with lots of celebrity Egyptians. - Really? - Yeah, but I don't speak hieroglyphics for crap so it got old very fast. - Oh. - It kinda sucked after that. - And then how did you get back? - Oh, well, I sold myself into slavery and got shipped to Scandinavia and basically just hopped off the boat once we got to the North Sea. Then that just did it. I got cold enough and then boom. - Wow. - Yep. There I am. Incredible, really. - Hey, what's going on in here? - Huh? - I swear I heard you talking about Ramesses the third. What was that about? - Oh, I was telling Clare what kind of history buff you are. - Mm-hm. - Well, did he tell you how his wife conspired to kill him to take the thrown? - Oh, yeah, it's my favorite. - Speaking of favorites, look what we did for our favorite guy? Surprise. - Are you hungry? - We did this for our favorite guy. - Okay, so we crossed service off the list with Mr. Clark, but the next thing is we need a tree like yesterday. - Agreed. - So I say when we're done here, we head right down to Loan Pine before it gets too crowded. - Loan Pine? - Yeah. - You're in the middle of mother nature and you wanna get your tree from a stupid mall? - Well, they have a good prices and they have this noble fir that I was checking out. - Clare, you don't pick a tree. A tree picks you. - Really? - Mac, have you taught her nothing of our family traditions? - I tried but she said no fake trees, end of story. - Sorry. - Fake trees, what are we, Chinese? - I know, I said the same thing. - What does that mean? - It means that the Bernard family tradition is to trudge through the frozen tundra at the risk of hyperthermia and to let the light of Christmas shine down on the tree that chooses us. - Really? - Yeah, really Clare. - I love that. That is so Christmasy. - I know. - Why didn't you ever tell me that? - Because it's 100 % something that we never ever did. - What are you talking about? - Dad was allergic to pine and Mom was religiously against the deforestation of conifers. We never did that. - Then why did we load in the station wagon every year and go into the backwoods to cut down a big ole Christmas tree? - Because you're confusing our family with the Griswold's. Okay? - No. - Yes, you are. Dad drove a Mercury Sable. We never ever did that. - That's not true, Clare. Don't listen to him. Oh, nevermind, you're right. That was from Christmas Vacation. - Yeah. - But it was a tradition to watch Christmas Vacation every year. - It's a classic. - I love that, we should do that. - Yeah, I'll see if I can get it On Demand. - No, no, not the movie. Well, we should do that, but also we should do the tree thing. We should start that tradition. - Yes, I call Chevy Chase. No, no way. - I called him, Maclain. - No, we're not, no way we're going to get a tree. We don't have a permit and there's no way we're gonna get one this late. - What are you talking about? There's no park rangers out on patrol this time of year. - No. - Just maybe the Jewish ones. - This is the exact time of year that they do patrol again because people like you go out and poach them. - Maclain, the chances of a Jewish ranger is slim to none. - Yeah. - Plus they hate camping. - All religious stereotypes aside, we don't have a permit, we're not doing it. - Well, well, well. What do we have here? - Cha-ching. - Yeah. We have been chosen. The perfect tree. - Just like the movie. Come on. It's beautiful. I think you should do the honors. Wait, me? No, this is your idea. - You're the oldest. Plus I gotta wiz like Seabiscuit. - Well, why don't you go on one of these right here? - And soil someone's Christmas? - Yeah. - I don't think so. I'll be right back. Are we really doing this? Chop chop. - Okay. Watch out. - Hold it right there, bub. That's it, reach for the sky. Come on, unless you want 30 CCs of bear tranquiler STAT. - You gotta be kidding me. - I'm only gonna say this once, lower your weapon. I repeat, lower your weapon. - Hey, who told you to put your hands down? - She did. - If she told you to jump off a cliff, would you do that? - No. - Then why did you lower your hands? - What is going on here? - That's what we wanna know. - We're all ears. - Yeah, why don't you tell us what you and pretty little lady there are gonna do with that fir tree? Sorry, my partner doesn't like it when I refer to other woman as pretty. My fiance doesn't like it when I refer to her as my partner. - It's not as intimate, wouldn't you agree? - Yeah, totally, I get that. - No one asked you, toots. So shut your mouth, alright? You're in enough trouble as it is. This particular species is the preferred domicile of the American cuckoo. - Cute little guys. - I know, the best. - Yeah. - So you better hope your hubby here has a permit for this evergreen before he goes all Paul Bunyan on it or you'll be having a blue, blue Christmas. - That's right and without a permit, you won't be going home for Christmas and you count on that. - Yeah, you'll be spending the 12 days of Christmas in a clink. - Okay, we get it. Give you the permit or it's like, come, you'll take us to jail, jail, jail, jail. - Hey, hey, hey. You think this is funny? That's a pretty good one. Write that one down. - I've already memorized it. - Yeah, good. - Now just give us the permit, we'll be on our way. - Listen, we don't have an actual permit per say. - Oh, that's what we wanted to hear, pal. Sorry. - Okay, alright. - 'Cause it's Santa Baby, baby, it's cold out. Come on, let's go. - I have it. I have it. I have a permit. I got it. Sorry, I have the permit, your honors. That's it right there, sorry. Just kinda riding dirty. - It stinks but it checks out. - Yeah, you better believe it. - Yeah, now what's with your nakedness? - Oh, I'm sorry, is my dress code in violation of the national park? - No, just a matter of personal curiosity. - Then I plead the fifth. - You're within your rights. - Thanks. - Well, good luck to you folks then and good luck with the harvest. Yeah, take care. - And may Santa, maybe next Christmas Santa Baby, uh. No, good luck. After you. - Merry Christmas. - Merry Christmas. Happy Hanukkah. They were Jewish. - Jake, why don't you have any clothes on? - I don't know actually. I think it had something to do with the time traveling. Just when I come back, it's super hot so just. I full on just shed my layers. Anyways, I wasn't planning on time traveling today or at all this weekend but desperate times. You know what I mean? Luckily though, saved your butts from going to jail. He said he was gonna take you and I believe it. - Well thank you. - Oh Clare, don't even. Alright, Mac, you wanna cut that down? We'll just drag it. I'm gonna go start the snowmobile. - Okay. - Alright. See you. - Hey babe, can you make me a gallon of sugar water? I wanna make sure this tree lives as long as possible. Who you texting? - I'm not texting anyone. I'm looking up the nearest mental institution in case we need it. - Well, I wish you'd stopped doing that and help me. You're not being very Christmasy. - Are we just gonna pretend like everything is normal? What happened out there was probably one of the most absurd things that's happened to me in a very, very long time. - Yeah, it was weird. It wasn't that weird. Well I'm just saying. In the context of the Jake I've known for the last 24 hours, it wasn't that weird. - He disappeared to take a leak and then came back half naked claiming to have gone back in time. - Yeah, and this morning he told me that his best friend was Richard Nixon so what should my frame of reference be? - Okay, I can handle some idle banter about his historical fantasies, but once he starts lying to us and also lying to law enforcement, that's where I have a problem. - Okay, park rangers, not law enforcement. There's a difference. - I just don't understand why you're not more concerned about this. - So he's a little crazy, so what? - So what, what if he hurts himself? What if he hurts us? He could burn this entire place down. - With what, a acapella riff? Come on, he's harmless. - Okay, you don't know that. - Relax, okay? Did he hurt anyone? Did he break any rules? I think he's in danger in is your ability to be a martyr. - Okay, are you being serious right now? - Yeah, you know what, I am because our whole marriage all I've ever heard you talk about is how hard it is to not have a family, about how there's this void in your heart that no one can understand. You have your brother here. And all you're doing is looking for excuses of how to get rid of him. - He thinks he can time travel. I don't need an excuse. - Maybe he can. - Okay, you need to stop it. - I'm just saying, he pulled a tree permit out of his armpit dated three days ago. - That is not time travel, Clare. That is called picking one up beforehand so he can dupe his sister-in-law. Don't you see what he's doing? - What? Spreading Christmas cheer? Being in a good mood? Making me laugh for the first time in, I don't know, months. I mean, you said you'd give him a chance. - Yeah, well, he is lying to us. - You know what, maybe he is. He might not be able to visit the past, but at least he knows how to live in the present. - Come on. - What happened? Did she burn herself on the hot chocolate? Did you burn yourself too? I should take a little try, right? Fudge! It is hot. - Babe, can I come in? - Can you just give me a minute please? - I'm sorry. I overreacted, I'll change my attitude, I promise. I really need you to come help me decorate the tree. - I'm not ready to talk to you right now. Okay? - Where's Clare Bear? - She's taking a rest in the room. I say we should start without her. - Perfect, I got the family ones. - Hey, can you do me a favor? - Yes. - Can you just the rest of the time we're here just not talk about time travel? - Well, that is a, I'm really. - Just stop it. - Alright, I'll stop. You know I am. - Now, got that out of the way. Let's show Clare how we decorate a Christmas tree. - Yeah, Bernard bros style. - Oh, ow. It's in my eyes. - That's never happened. - Okay, now make sure that it's pretty and even and spaced around. Now go around, keep going. Okay, pretty side out. Now hand it over to me. - Coming at ya. - Now we're stuck up there. ♪ I'm here to share a little Christmas, too ♪ - Oh, you're stuck up. - Good one, pal. Thanks, dude. - Hey, hold on, move that over that. Take a couple of these bad boys. Actually I'll hand 'em to you, okay? - Okay, we should put them all over. Yeah, it think we should put them all over. - Alright, I'm getting kind of tired. - Dad always hated these ones. - Yeah, Dad was afraid of red. The color red, he was like a bull. - In a china shop. - Mm-hm. Should we put any in the back or the back is? - Not a lot in the back. This is the mainly for the front. Do you need any of these things? ♪ Red and green shine bright - Maybe I do take one of the bags. ♪ Waited all year to get into the spirit ♪ - Are you just throwing them up there? - No, I got that. I hung it up, it's perfect. - Don't put that there. Put that right here. - Oh, that's a good idea. ♪ Everyone is merry ♪ and neighborhood's alive I just all untangled all mine. - You have smaller fingers. - No, I don't. ♪ It won't be long until we're headed to the new year ♪ ♪ So turn on the Christmas lights ♪ This is kinda fun. - Yeah. You have bigger hands and smaller fingers. ♪ Everyone is singing and everyone is merry ♪ ♪ And the neighborhood's alive - This is the devil. - Saved the best for last. - Oh yeah. ♪ Turn on the Christmas lights Cool, dude. - Oh yes, here we have the classic clothespin Rudolph with the sparkly nose, the cottontail, made by yours truly in 1988. - That's awesome. Oh yes, here we have the creepy clown doll painted by me in 1995 at Granny and Papa's new house. - Ah yeah, I remember that year. You were quite adept with the paintbrush even at 10. - Oh, truly, truly. - Truly, truly, truly. Oh, remember this one? I love that. - This is my favorite one. - Yeah, that was mine. - This is not yours, this is mine. - No, that one's mine. - Yours was yellow and you ripped the cord right off first day. - Oh, that's true. Dang, 2001. That seems like yesterday. - It seems like everyday. - You wanna talk about those dreams? - How did you? - Dude, don't be mad at her. She worried about you. And she's a blabber when she's uncomfortable. I do it too. I think a lot of us do. I had 'em too actually for a long time. Except in mine Dad was always Dolph Lundgren and Mom was always that gelfling chick from The Dark Crystal. Which is weird, I haven't watched that movie in forever. But I finally learned how to make 'em stop. - How? - I started time traveling. Jake, we-- - I know, you told me not say that. I'm not suggesting you time travel 'cause honestly I don't think you could. It's not inside your body like it is for me, but it wasn't really the time traveling that made it stop. It was just that I was ready to face that reality and face those problems head on. That's when it stopped. - Well, glad you figured it out. 'Cause I sure haven't. - No, you haven't. You're actually a pretty hot mess. I'm just kidding. But you will figure it out. I know you will. And I have a present for you that I think will help. I was gonna wait till Christmas time, but I think it's overdue. Okay, is this thing on? How do you know if it's running? - Just hold it steady. There you go. Hey bro, I know I didn't get you anything awesome for Christmas this year, but since I got this sweet new camera, I thought I'd just make you something instead. This year is a tribute to the B squared. What's that, you say? Well, I'm about to break it down for you. Double B, B squared, best buds, buzzin' bros, Bernard brothers, and the best double B of 'em all is my big brother, Mac attack. Mac attack, Mac attack. He's smart. He knows more about history than any dude I know. B squared, he's probably reading the encyclopedia right now, yo. Mac attack, Mac attack. He's tough, he broke his femur when he was only two years old. He learned to walk in his body cast, made his legs real strong. B squared, break it down. And let's not forget, he's good with the ladies. Maclain is the best brother anyone could've ever asked for on Christmas. All you haters beware, beware 'cause we are the B squared. I'm here with the lucky parents of Maclain Stephenson Bernard. What do you have to say about this wonderful son of yours, sir? - Oh, well, shoot. I haven't prepared anything. Maclain is the type of son that makes it easy to be a dad. Maclain is a great boy and soon he's gonna be a great man. And I'm very proud to be his father. Was I good? - Well, thanks, sir. - Thank you. - Well said. And you, ma'am, what do you have to add to the remarks of your husband? - Oh, okay, well everything that you need to know about Maclain can be seen in his eyes. That boy is true blue. Loyal, caring, kind. He does his best to always do the right thing even when it isn't easy. He loves his family more than anything else in the world. - Yes he does. - And he would do anything for them. Especially his mom. - Whoa, wait, wait, is that true? - And I hope that he knows how much we love him too. Now back to you, Jake, you handsome devil you. - Very nice. I wanted to give that you earlier but... You know. I missed you. - I missed you, too. - An organic brother hug in front of a fully trimmed Christmas tree? - We did it. - You can't get more Christmasy than that. - Or can you? Mistletoe for to try to have a kiss. - Okay, you're good, you're good. Or you two. - No, we're good. - It looks great, you guys. - Thank you. - Except you forgot the star. - No, I couldn't find it anywhere. - I looked too. Very poorly but I couldn't find it. - Really, in the bins? - No. - I wonder if we left up in the attic. - Oh, I'll go get it. - You sure? - Yeah. - Thank you, Jake. - Don't be scared. - Hey, we're in full family mode right now. It's pretty cool. - I didn't see that coming. - Neither did it. Did you see this coming? Mistletoe. - Really? - Kiss me. - Okay, okay. - Let's see, babies. ♪ If I was a star on the tree ♪ I will be hiding in a bunch of this old thing ♪ ♪ We got some rope to do stuff for ♪ No way. Oh yeah. Double no way, ooh. - Now this is my favorite view of Christmas. We got the tree, the stocking. We got this view right here. - Not bad, huh? - No, not bad at all. - Oh, yoohoo. So, I did not find the star, but I did find these cool family Christmas videos. - Yes, we should watch them. - And I found this. - Ew, no, put that away. - It has been away, Clare. It can not be away anymore. - My gosh, Dad's old shotgun. - You better believe it. - Where'd you find this? - It was upstairs under a bunch of junk in the attic. Let's go shoot sometimes. - No. - Yes. - Absolutely not. We are not shooting a living thing. - Oh, why? We just cut down a living thing. - Yeah, what's the difference? - That's not the same thing. - It is the same thing, Clare. I'm sorry to tell you this, but this is a family tradition. It's called a Christmas hunt. - Don't soil the name of Christmas. - Clare, it's a tradition. Do you hate traditions? - This time he's telling the truth. - Really, you too? I can't believe you can even hold that thing. - Come on, it's not like we ever actually shoot anything. We just sit around on a blanket, drink hot chocolate, and we chat about lots of stuff. - Like about feelings? - No, Clare. Please, it's Christmas hunt time. Now get your coats, it's time to go. - Okay. Fine, but the only reason I'm going is because conversing in this beautiful snow sounds really fun. - Fine. - I'll make some hot chocolate. - I'll go pee. - I'll get the duck call. Hello? Maclain, John McClane, Die Hard. - Hello, who is this? - Maclain, it's me, Doctor Murphy. Come on. - Oh, hey Dr. Murphy, what are you calling about? - Maclain, your brother's life may be in danger. Listen to me if you want him to live. Schwarzenegger, right? - Okay, I'm gonna hang up now. - No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. See, now Maclain, now what I need not to do is hang up on me because I did a little research and it occurred to me that your brother's life legitimately may be in danger. Also, as a parallel track to that, yours may be too. - What do you mean? - So after our last conversation, Maclain, I did a little digging because I felt slightly a yucky inside of myself, right? So, what I discovered after digging is that maybe you shouldn't reconnect with your brother because he has a long history of. I can't whistle and what I'm doing is the fingers around the temple thing that they do, you know? What I'm getting at is he's straight up crazy, right? He really is. So he has psych history that is longer than my. I can't whistle. I'm pointing downwards. He has a history of depression. - He's delusional sure but depressed? I don't think so. - Depression can often disguise itself as many different things, right? Take me for example. You know me as the life of the party. However, I will tell you that I'm often zipping on Zoloft, right? And you've never called me out on it. It happens. He escaped from three different mental institutions and he made several suicide attempts. Most of them are drowning. - How did I now know about this? - Now, now, now, now, it's just me, but it occurred to me that maybe you never cared to ask. Maclain? Hello? Maclain? - Yeah? - Here's what I need you to do. I need you to do me a promise, okay? I need you to not feed your brother after midnight. Wait, that's something else. No, but still good advice. What I need you to do, okay? Is realize that this brother of yours, he can manipulate you into thinking things are okay and suddenly, wham. - Wham what? - I don't know what's in your brother's brain. 'Cause the brains are complicated things. There's cerebellum and the cerebral cortex and we don't have a MapQuest to the brain yet. - Okay, well great. Thanks a lot for the help. - Oh, it's no bother at all. This, this, this, this is what us doctors do, you see? And I'm a therapist, I'm a hypnotherapist. See, see. You still there? Virgin mojito, Dr. Murphy? - Thank you. You will not be a virgin mojito for long. Not the straw, not the straw. Straw's daddy's. Probably a pretty good spot up around here. We just have to find a clear spot. Well, I think we should go to the spot we use to always go. Yeah. You guys have to promise not to shoot any cute things. Everything we're shooting at gonna be maybe cute, right? Yeah. What about over here? Yeah, let's go down there. I'm going down this way. - We should go around this way. No, that's dangerous, Jake. - No, there's a path. Go this way. There's a path right here. This is like a nice, gentle path. I think we should go this way. This is a path if I ever saw. Jake, you're gonna fall. He's gonna do what he does. I think I should get to hold the gun 'cause I'm the one wearing hunter's orange. I'm gonna take care of it, dude. Are you okay? Yeah. Well, I'm just saying I know how to handle guns. I'm a real man. - Wow, it's really easy this way. - Hold on, I'm about there. - This way's way faster. - You beat us. - Yeah. - I think this looks good. - I'm gonna kill a thousand ducks. - We gotta put the blanket down. Put it right here, this is the duck spot. - I've never done this before. It's so pretty out here. - Very, very pretty. - Very Christmasy. - It's straight up Christmas out here. - Have to be quiet. Are you serious? - I have hair in my mouth. - Okay. There you go, there they are. There you go, Donald. Shoot one of 'em. No, they're too far away. - I wanna do it then. Just let me take the gun. - Dude, I am gonna be in charge of the gun. You be in charge of the duck call. - Fine. Just come on, give me the gun. Give me one try. - No, we haven't even, I haven't even got a full try. - You guys, how long do you think you could survive out here? I mean, like you were stuck. - Why do we have to be all morbid? - It's just a question. - Yeah, I like it. - Do I have a gun? - No, no gun. - That's about right. - Mm-hm. - Do I have a phone? - Yeah, you can have a phone but it's dead. - Why would you give him a phone? What the point if it's dead? - Because he's been stuck out here. - Why would you give him a dead phone? - It's just a game. - Yeah. - What's the point? Why does he get a phone if it's dead? - Maclain, play or don't. - Okay, you have a dead phone. Good luck doing something with that. - I guess he wouldn't survive. - He wouldn't, doesn't sound like he'll survive. - How many days? - Fine, I'll play. Do I have you? - Yeah. - Do I have you? Okay, that's really weird. - That's not so weird. I gotta know how much food to get. - Is that what you meant? - Yeah, that's what I meant. You weirdo. - You probably meant that I was dead and-- - Is Maclain dead in this scenario? - No, he's not dead but you're out here alone. All by yourself. - Alright, well, this is will answer your question, Clare. I have all the water mother nature's provided for us. - Yeah, but he needs to be melted or else-- - It will melt. I have every pocket full of thousands of licorice. And I got a sweet rifle. - Dude, dude. - Oh my gosh! - No, no. - Oh my gosh. - Why did you do that? - How did I do that? You did, you grabbed the gun. This is all your fault. - No, it was an accident, I didn't. It's a male and a female. - They were probably married to each other. - Let's just put 'em away. Let's just bury 'em. - Just cover 'em, bury 'em. - Let some animal eat them. - And no one will know. - No, no, you know what? You guys did this. You murdered these birds and now you're gonna bring 'em back to the cabin. Come on, pick 'em up. - I don't wanna touch these. I am not eating these. - Oh, yes, you darn well will. We will use every part of these buffalo. Now gut it. - They're such a beautiful pair. - Can't we just go bury them in an eternal grave of snow? - Fine but if I hear or see that gun again, I will use it on both of you idiots. Understand? Now get rid of 'em. Goodbye little duckies.

I would've never let him anywhere near the gun. - Well, I haven't had a chance until now. This is the first time we've been alone. - I knew he was a trip but suicidal? - I know, I know but that's what Dr. Murphy said. - You said he was a quack. - Yeah, but you said he was highly recommended so. - Do you think I've been nice enough? Do you think he's felt nurtured by me? What do we do? - I think the only thing we can do is take him somewhere where he can get professional help. I was looking up some institutions earlier. We can take him in tonight. - On Christmas Eve? Are you kidding? No, no, what he needs right now is to feel love and supported by his family. He needs to know that we accept him for who he is. Okay, and you need to put on your boots and go out there before he jumps in the lake. Hi, oh, what took you so long? You were gone forever. - I'm so sorry. I was doing a funeral service for the ducks. I'm fine, it's not too cold out there. I could use an extra couple blankets though if you got it. - Yeah, of course, of course. - I'm glad you're okay, man. - Thanks, brother. - You think any wild animals are gonna get the ducks? - Definitely, I left them wide open for foxes or whatever. You guys are being so nice to me. - Well, we really care about you. I mean, I hope you know that. - We really, really care. - Yeah, I feel it, I do. Just right. Good. - I got plenty more of these. - That's okay. - So, why don't you tell us about one of your warps? - Clare, I'm not allowed to talk about that. No, we're curious. - Yeah, Jake, it's okay. We wanna hear about them. - Well, I don't know. There's a lot of 'em. I guess, there was this one time that I was at Coachello. - It's Coachella. Or Co-achella. It's just depending on who's. I'm sorry, go on. - I wondered off one night into the desert and I lost track of my body temperature and fell asleep and bam. I woke up in the same desert but it was millions of years before. I was in the dinosaur age. Surrounded by little tiny dinosaurs and bigger ones. But the tiny ones are the mean ones and that's what scientists don't know yet. - So what did you do? - Well, I pulled out some licorice and I fed it to the tiny ones. And then the bigger ones ate the tiny ones while they were eating the licorice and I skedaddled. - So, how did you warp back? - Well, Maclain, it was a desert so it was hot all the time. So, I did what any man could. I waited. - Until what? - Well luckily there was an ice age in about six months, so that took care of that. It also took care of the dinosaurs. - Oh good. - I have a question. I'm a little confused. Most scientist believe that the ice age that killed the dinosaurs took a lot longer than six months. - Well I didn't say the ice age. I said. A ice age. - Oh well, then I mean scientifically that there was a lot of ice ages so you're right. - Yeah, I lived it. What do you mean? You don't believe me? - No, of course, it's not that I don't believe you. I was just saying that scientifically you are spot on. - Thank you. And it feels really good to be validated. Lots of times people just say that I'm whack. - You're not whack. No, that's whack that people think you're whack. - Yeah. - Right, Maclain? - I mean, your, what you've been through is yours. And they're your experiences and no one can take that away what you have experienced. - Thank you. It feels really good to have my brother believe me. Oh fudge, is it 7:00? - Why, what's the matter? We have to do the nativity. - Why at 7:00? - What, at 7:00 because that's when Jesus was born. - I don't think anyone really knows when he was-- - Maclain, I... - Should we get the costumes? - Brother and sister, this for your delectation and delight, here is the nativity story presented to you by me as scene by me in real life as it happened in the flesh when it was going on at the beginning, my account, gospel according to Jake. It's also about an hour and a half long so buckle up. Clare, I need you to play mother Mary. Maclain, I have other parts for you, but they don't come for a little while. - Okay. - Alright. Clare. For I bring you great tiding of great joy. Mary, I would like to marry you. I'm Joseph of. How did you get that because we're not married and people will want to hurt you? Joseph. Ah, what is it? You have not been with Mary, but she is pregnant and it is immaculate. And she will have a baby and he will be. Take her to Bethlehem. I had a dream. - Mm-hm? - And in that dream I saw an angel. Will you marry me? - Yes. - It's just for this play. - Yes, Joseph, of course. - Anyways, then they when on a journey and they needed a donkey. Maclain, can you help us be a donkey? Yeah, come on, just like that. There you go. And Mary almost fell off one time. - Oh. - You guys don't know that, but Mary almost fell one time. Rest here, Mary. - Okay. - And I will go find an innkeeper. Maclain. And he did approach an innkeeper and he said to the innkeeper. He's said there's no room at this inn. - There's no room at this end, but-- - Here, you can sit down. Mary, did you know? - What? - That one day your baby will be born in a stable. And then the shepherds were out in the field. They did have a a shepherd. Sh, sheep. One night the angels or the shepherds were sleeping in their fields. Shh. They woke up to a mighty angel. The same one that had come to Mary. Shepherds, why are you lowing? - Because we-- - You're just one of the sheep. - Behold. - You don't say behold. Don't you guys see the star? And the shepherds looked up at the star. Shh, shh, shh. And they saw it and they said, we see that star and the angel said, go to it for unto to us this night is born this Savior, a city of Dagul. Meanwhile, back at the manger, she was having her baby. Down, it's over there. It's right down there. And then pick it up and put it on your lap and then pretend like you love it. Oh, I love this baby. - Yeah, don't tell me, just show me. And... ♪ Silent night, holy night The star was born. And Joseph said to Mary, ♪ All is calm you did good. ♪ All is bright The shepherds brought him gift ♪ Round yon virgin ♪ Mother and child For the wisemens came and this is gold. ♪ Holy infant Don't put it on his stomach. It will crush him. ♪ So tender and mild And they brought him this frankincense. - Oh. - Brought the gifts. ♪ Sleep in heavenly peace And they brought him this expensive blanket all the way from orient. Don't cover his face or he will suffocate. Amen. That's the real story. That's really how it happened. Most of it was word for word. I messed up on a couple parts but.

You forgot these. - Oh, thanks. - Here you go, buddy. - Thanks, buddy. - Hey, that was a really good show. - Oh, that ole thing? I'm been doing that for years. - Well, it's really a tearjerker. - I can't wait till you guys have kids so I don't have to do it all by myself. You don't want kids? - Oh, no, of course we want kids. We just, we can't. At least not on our own. - Well, I can't be right. - Yeah, it's really sad. I don't really know how to tell people. Things have been really hard between Clare and I. Maybe you should know. It's weird at first sight. I kinda resented her 'cause we thought it was 'cause of her. Then recently, they think it might be me. - Yeah, tell me this after I make her baby Jesus' mom. - No, that was fine. It's just in the future though definitely be careful about mentioning kids or babies. It's just I don't wanna upset her, you know? And it's hard enough as it is. - Well, I feel like I should tell you this. Hey babe. - Yeah? - You coming to bed? - Yeah, I'll be right there, babe. I should go. - Yeah, sure, sure, sure, sure. - Merry Christmas, baby brother. - Merry Christmas, B squared. - Baby, babe. - Hm? - Wake up. Hey. No nightmares. - Really? - Yeah. - Aw babe. - Okay, but your breath is kinda like a nightmare. - Merry Christmas to you, too. It's Christmas. - It's Christmas. - Yes, finally.

You're welcome. - We thought you'd need a new one. - I did, my old one was super tattered. - I think it's been a pretty awesome Christmas. - Well I have one for you guys. Hold on. What? Yeah, here, you sit there. Okay. And you sit there. - You know you didn't have to get us anything. I know, but I wanted to. - Oh, that's where all the toilet paper went. - It's beautiful. - Oh yeah. We're out by the way. It's for both of you, but I think maybe Clare should open it. - Okay. You know just you being here is enough. - I know, I know. Just open the present. - Okay. It's in here somewhere. - I see it. - Oh, here we go. There's something. - Oh. - What is it? - You guys, I know Maclain said that you probably can't have kids 'cause his little guys don't swim straight or whatever, but those doctors are idiots. You have a baby girl and she's so sweet. You name her Lucy. - Excuse me. - No, no Clare. She's healthy and you're healthy. - What do you think you're doing? - Well, I'm just telling-- - What are you doing? - Maclain, I'm telling you. What are you telling me? - What are you-- - I told you specifically not to talk about that. - Maclain, I just, you have a baby and she's happy and healthy. - We can't have a baby, okay? I told you that. - I know, but I'm telling you that's wrong. You do have a baby, and you don't have it through adoption. You have it the old fashioned way. - You don't know that. You haven't seen it. Yes, I have. - You can not time travel. - You said you believed me. - I don't believe you. How can I believe you? Everything you say is a lie. - That's not true. You're my brother. - Okay, you think you can time travel? - Yeah. - Why didn't you go back and save mom and dad, huh? Why did you let that happen? Why didn't you save 'em? - You can't change the past. - Okay, yeah. - You can only observe it. - It's really convenient. You just make up a rule about how it works. Okay, but it doesn't work 'cause you can't do it. - Yes, I can. - You need to stop telling yourself that, okay? 'Cause it only hurts us. I gotta go in there now and deal with this. So you need to pack up your crap and when I get out here, I am taking you somewhere where you can get help because I can't help you. I can't help you. - I, I'm... Are you okay? Just let your brother pull you for a little bit. - I'm so sorry. I specifically told him not to talk about that, but doesn't matter, he's packing his things. I'm gonna take him somewhere. He's not gonna bother us. Is that fun? What? - What are you doing? Should we do it again? - You gotta just stop protecting me. - I'm your husband. I'm suppose to do that. - You think by protecting me it doesn't hurt as much, but actually you're making it worse. I know that you hide the baby magazines, and I know that you tell my friends and my mom to not mention anything that could possibly remind me of our situation. But I need to deal with this. Let me deal with this. He has been nothing but sweet to you. He adores you. And you just tell him he's crazy. You think that's helping? You just... Be his brother. You okay? Yeah. - I think he needs another hug. Can you come give him a hug? - Goodbye snow. Goodbye beautiful trees. Beautiful duck blood. Goodbye Maclain. - Hey Jake. Jake? Jake? Jake, did you go up in the attic? Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake! Jake, stop if you can. Jake, where did you go? Jake! Come on, man. I wanna talk. Mommy. - Are you okay? Okay, we got down together. You guys, we're gonna get you. Jake! Jake! Jake, wait up. - What? - Wait up, Jake. - Maclain. - Wait up with you. - Please, don't go. Jake. Jake, please, please. Don't go. Come home, please. - I don't think that's a good idea. You said a lot of mean stuff to me. - I know, I was a real jerk. But you're my brother and I need you in my life. - Well, I can't be in your life if you don't believe me. - I believe you, Jake. I lost you once, I don't wanna lose you again. - Well, that's good 'cause I didn't really wanna go anywhere anyway. - Come here. Jake, Jake! Jake! - It's cold. - Hold on to me, I got you. - No, it can't hold us. - Jake. - Mac, you gotta go. - No, Jake. I'm not gonna let go of you. - You have to, you have to go. - I'm not letting go of you. I need you. I'm not gonna let you go. I can't. - Mac, you can't come with, okay? You gotta go. - I'm not, please. - You said you believed me. - I do. - Then prove it. ♪ I'm just trying to do that for you ♪ ♪ Did the things you wanted me to ♪ ♪ To get by we gotta stay together ♪ ♪ Driving time is now or never ♪ It's now or never ♪ Now or never, now or never ♪ It's now or never ♪ Now or never - No, Jake! ♪ It's now or never Somebody help! ♪ It's now or never ♪ Now or never ♪ Time is fleeting I brought you fresh set of clothes if you're ever back this way.

And you were right. She's beautiful. Merry Christmas, bud. What do you think? Does it fit? You like it? - Hold it up a little bit. Just a little. Ah, there they are. - Okay, very funny. And thank you. Glad you liked it. - Merry Christmas. Merry Christmas. - Uh-oh, uh-oh, somebody's awake. Who's awake? Who's awake? - No, you can't just get this wet. - Here comes the Lucy. Hi little cute cute. Hi little cute cute. Go see Momma. - Hi, did you have a good nap? Oh, I love you so much. Did you have a fun nap? - Love you little muffin. I'll go get a bottle. - I love you so much. Merry Christmas, babe. - Alright, hey babe, can you maybe get a little bit less water in there for me? Thank you. Okay, oh wow, that's so nice. Good job. - Do you know what year it is? - 2000 Z.
