They were led by this Caldwell. He bought the mine. Then, little by little, the whole town. He forced people to sell... ...using any method he could. Then the plague began... because of the polluted wells. Now Caldwell won't let anyone leave town unless they're sick or dying. Why are you helping me? We all have the right to be born.

I'd almost forgot what it sounded like. What happened to your bow? It went like all the things that belong to a drunk. I hooked it for some booze. But you were never a drinking man. Yeah, that's right. I know that. I used to have something to hope for... my freedom. That was a long time ago. Now the war is over. Now you've got your freedom. I found out what it was worth. That's why I drink. George, who is Caldwell? (♪ Plays banjo tune) Do you remember that? Sounds different. I ain't got but three strings. I'm waiting for them to bust. And me with them. (Wind howls) You say there was a man causing trouble down at the saloon? That's right, Mr. Caldwell. Well, tell me more about it, Slade. He shot Ben and Charlie without even turning around. Don't talk balderdash, man. There ain't nobody can hit a target without looking at it. - Without looking at it? - You're wrong. There are two men who can. Our Pa is one. And the other is...

Aren't you hungry? Come on in! Well, you gonna stand there all clay? Come on in. Welcome home, son. You've been gone quite a while this time. Where have you been? Fighting a war. You win it or lose it? I just happened to be on the winning side. - Meet anybody faster than you? - Not yet. Maybe I never will. Come on over here, you over-grown papoose! (Gunshots) 'I passed through the town. What's going on there?' 'Pretty soon there won't be no town. 'They don't like guns, won't defend themselves. - 'Won't fight back.' - 'How about my half-brothers?' 'The boys chose the side of the strongest. Can't blame them for that.' - (Keoma) 'And who is the strongest?' - 'Caldwell.' You used to be the strongest. The fastest. I used to be the fastest. That's not the strongest. Just means you live a little longer. Don't mean you're right either. I've lived long enough to find out how wrong I was about... ...so many things. The great Shannon. I saw George. Hmm... Did you? Pa? Hmm? - What was it all about? - What? The war. I never could figure it out. The war... Not sure I know. I figure, after we got through slaughtering all those Indians, we thought we oughta do something... generous. So we gave freedom to the black men. Now we feel good, we can go back to finish off the Indians. You've been in love, yet? Not as much as you. Well... Yeah. She was quite a woman. You must be very lonely. You know what it is you're searching for, hmm? Myself, I guess. I don't know. I need to find out who I am. To give the simplest of my actions a reason. I know my being in this world has some significance. But I'm afraid when I find out what it is, it'll be too late. In the meantime, I'm a vagabond. I keep traveling. Even when the Earth sleeps, I keep traveling. Chasing shadows. I think that's the way I felt when your mom had died. And when you went away. I'd like to do something, Keoma. But... You know, it's funny, all my life I've looked at death. Looked him straight in the eye. I was never afraid. Now I'm old, dying slowly... ...I wanna live. I'm afraid. What should I do? I can't shoot it out with my own sons. (Woman) Come on, bitch! Somebody come up and get her outta here! Throw her out! Right out! Now move! Don't let her touch anything. Keep her off the furniture. We don't wanna get infected. You better keep your distance. What about the stuff in my room? I'll have to burn everything I own, my clothes, everything! For God's sake throw her out! Well, well... look who's here. If that ain't our little lady friend. Hey, what happened to your chaperone? Huh? (Laughter) Don't tell me the honeymoon is over. Ha-ha! Move! Come on. (Woman) Wait a minute, who's gonna pay me back? Nigger, you shouldn't have stepped in my path like that. That was a dumb thing to do. You're leaving your stink around. I'll just have to clean it up. (Laughs) (George grunts) (Laughter) Come on... (George) 'But I could. But there was too many of them.' She didn't have a chance with a scum like me. 'I can hardly defend myself. They said it was Caldwell.' Caldwell? Where is she now? (George) 'I tried. God knows I tried.' Where did they take her? Where did they take her, nigger? They said something about the old mine.

I don't believe you, lady. - This is your last chance... - (Gunshot) Yam! This is my son, George. My dear brothers. Butch. Sam. Lenny. Three names... ...one brand. There's no use hiding your faces. It won't change the way you behave. It's been a long time. But you haven't changed a bit. Why don't you get outta here? You're were never welcome in our family. You don't have to rush him. Our half-brother knows how to run away when he feels like it. (Caldwell) That's enough of that! Forget your family squabbles. These poor people need decent accommodation. And enough food to sustain them. And it's up to us. They're neighbors. We'll see that they get it. Because the rest of the world is ignoring the plague raging among us. But if we give them a brotherly hand, we can overcome this crisis. Will you join us? I'll pay you well. You'll pay, don't worry. And my price is high. We'll see. Ha! Go away, stranger. Don't try to help us. We're already dead. But you're still afraid. Death hasn't changed that. It's not for ourselves, it's for our wives and children, and for the townsfolk we infected.

Why did he come back? What does he expect to prove? That nothing's changed between us? That he can stand our way like he's done ever since we were kids? Well, let me tell you, Pa, he won't. Times are different now. Things have changed around here. He's been away too long. And the only thing that's keeping us from sinkin' a bullet into his head is our respect for you. We've gotta put a stop to his shenanigans. Are you that much afraid of Keoma? Or are you afraid of what Caldwell's gonna think of you? Hell, no, but you never gave us a chance, Pa. You were too busy caring for that half-breed to have any time for us. You never gave us the affection you gave to him. You forgot that we were your real sons. Real sons? All of you are my sons.

Yeah, you're right. When he gets skinful, he plays really cheerful. Ha-ha! - George? - Yeah, it's me. It isn't her time yet. A few more days. Otherwise she's in perfect health. Nothing wrong with her. All she needs now is rest. You could take her away. There's nobody outside. Good. - She's staying here. - She's sta...? Oh, no, no. That's impossible. She can't stay here. If they find out, it'll be all over for us. How much is Caldwell paying you not to treat the plague victims? How dare you say that? I do all I can! But he won't let me order the medicines or contact the authorities. Caldwell and his gang won't let anyone out of town, unless they are dead! How am I going to fight them? Alone? And there's my wife. I have to think of her. She's the only thing I've got. No, no, no, I don't want to be mixed up in this. So you just give up inch by inch. But if you feel like that, you might as well be dead now. What's happened to you, George? I used to admire you so much. I've never forgotten the lessons you taught me. You were my idol. You, a black man, and me, a half-Indian. I learned from you that the color of man's skin doesn't make any difference. In those days, you were never afraid of anything. From a wild-cat to a grizzly bear! And you could whip any man in town with one hand behind your back! And now look at you. Both of you... two cowards! What do we have to do? Get out of town. Inform the authorities and bring back medical supplies. But how? You already said it. We'll go like the dead. Alright, George. Why are you helping us? Who are you doing it for? For myself, maybe.

What's the matter, Indian? You look like you don't feel so good. See what happens when you go picking a fight? It ain't healthy. Hey. Hey! Are you dead? Haven't you had enough?

How much are you willing to pay? Four cents. Four cents? Four cents is mighty little. The price of four bullets. One. Two. Three. And four. Take it. It has your name on it. Now go tell Caldwell I'm waiting here for him. Waiting for me, huh? Well, that's the last time he's gonna have to wait. Mount up! I think it's about time we got rid of Caldwell. Get rid of him? That would be a big mistake. 'Right now is when we need him the most.' (Lenny) 'Come on, Butch, what are you talking about? 'What the hell do we need him for?'
