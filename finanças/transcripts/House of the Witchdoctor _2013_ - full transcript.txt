You know it's the one year anniversary of John's death. - I know, I know. - They've come up here this weekend to keep me company. - They seem like good friends to me. - Yeah. - [Sheriff] I was unable to find those guys. Usually things like this are just losers passing through town. Most likely they're, they're long gone by now. Did you guys want to come down to the station and fill out a report? - What do you think? - I kind of just want to get to the house. - Yeah. Yeah, I think uh, we'll just keep on going. - You know, I, I totally understand. Tell you what, I'm going to swing by Leslie's parents' house later tonight. I'll make sure everybody's safe and sound. - Thank you. - [Sheriff] Don't mention it and try not to worry too much. You kids got absolutely nothing to worry about here in my town. Say hi to your father for me, would you Leslie? - I will. - [Sheriff] Thank you. I'm due for a checkup. You kids take care. - That cops a freaking idiot.

How was the drive? - Oh, it was a little drama, but I don't want to talk about it. Another time. Let me introduce you to my friends. - Oh good. - This is Patty, Thad, Regina and Tom. - So nice to meet you Mrs. Van Hooten.

All right. - [Leslie] Let me introduce you to my friend's, dad. Guys, this is my dad, Dr. Peter Van Hooten. - Thank you very much. Please everyone call me Peter. - So you guys are leaving tonight. - Uh yes, we're going down to Aunt B's to bring her back tomorrow 'cause she can't drive on her own anymore. - You must all be exhausted from your journey. Why don't you show your friends to their rooms, Leslie? - Good idea, come on guys. - So nice to meet you. - Oh, it's nice to meet you. - Uh everyone. I, I have one quick rule and that is nobody's allowed in the basement. That's where I do my research and nobody goes down there, so other than that, I hope you have a great weekend. - [Regina] Thanks. - Don't mention it. - It's nice to meet you all. We'll see you tomorrow. What a nice group. - Finally, come here. I need it. - You got it baby. I'm gonna give it to you good. [suspenseful music] [laughter] - You have a nice room, Patty. - Thanks. Where's yours? - Upstairs. - You like it? - Yeah, it's uh, it's quiet. I should be able to get a lot of reading done this weekend. - You know, you can stay down here with me if you like. - No um, God says we should wait until we get married. I want to though. - We wouldn't have to do it, Thad. We could just be together. It'd be a nice way to spend the weekend, don't you think? - It just, it just wouldn't be right. ♪ He don't love me anymore - I suppose you're right. I mean 'cause that's what the scripture say, right? - [Thad] Yes. Well um, I'm gonna go take a nap. I'll talk to you soon. - Okay. - I love you. - Love you too. ♪ 'Cause he loves me no more ♪ Tears been spilling down my cheeks ♪ ♪ Heavy rhythm, my heart beats ♪ Lonely whimper, my lips moan ♪ 'Cause he loves me no more ♪ Oh, oh ♪ Blackened Sunday ♪ Since he took my breath away - I wish we didn't have to leave. - Are you guys all packed? - Yes dear. It's just one night. - You're going to be okay with everything? - Yes, I'll be fine. - All right. All right. I'll miss you. - I'll miss you too. - Come on. - Bye sweetie. - Bye. Drive safe.

My dad got it when he was volunteering as a doctor down there with the Red Cross. - It's beautiful. [subtle music] - Man, we got to find a place to hit it.

I'll see you in the morning. - Good night, Leslie. - You think she's going to be okay? - I don't know. I really get worried sometimes. - Me too. - Well, you guys got this right? - Thad. - Yeah, we got it. - He said you got it. - That's rude. - I got it, it's fine. [laughter] - Great, I have no life. - Hey, not here. Well, we shouldn't go down there. Leslie, are you okay? We're sorry. - You cannot go down there. You could get hurt. - We were just being stupid, it won't happen again. - We're sorry. - That's my father's private space, no one is allowed down there ever. - I know, it's my fault. It won't happen again. - Goodnight. - What's that? - I've never seen her like that before. - I know, she actually kinda scared me. I think I lost my hard on. - You're such an ass.

We're gonna cook you alive unless you open that fucking door! - It's a terrible way to die, sweetheart. Burning. Come on, you come out right now, I'll do you really quick. - This house is kinda creepy, bro. - Yeah, she ain't coming out. Come on, let's go find some gasoline. [doorbell rings] - I'll see who it is. Fuck! - What? - It's a bunch of freaks out there dressed all funny and shit. Shit! [suspenseful music] - [Cliff] What the fuck, man? Who are you people? - Yeah, why are you dressed like that? - You'll know soon enough. [suspenseful music] - Back up off me. - This your house? - I need you to drop those knives. - We don't want no trouble. - Yeah, 'cause obviously this is a big misunderstanding. - It certainly is. Now, if you gentlemen would join us in the basement, we have some business to attend to. [suspenseful music] - Were you looking for me? [suspenseful music] - Run! [laughter] [upbeat rock music] [shouting] - Come on, come on, give me the fucking keys! [upbeat rock music] Hurry man, let me in! [upbeat rock music] Is that the ice? Did, did we just see that? - Yeah, we just saw that. - Fuck, it's not starting! - Shut up, shut up, shut up! - Fuck man, hurry! - Fucking start, I'm gonna go have to go check the engine. - Cliff, Cliff, people are out there. - What? There's more of them! Oh, you fucking whore, come on! - Fuck! - What the fuck? Fuck man! - What are we gonna do? What is this shit? - Fuck! [suspenseful music] You mother fucker. God dammit. - You told me you were gonna take me to the police station. When is the Sheriff gonna get here? - [Woman] Soon, dear. It's all going to be all right. Try not to worry. - Somebody just raped me and killed my boyfriend and you tell me not to worry. - The Sheriff will be here soon, dear. Try some mint tea. It calms the nerves. - That's a good girl. - My friends are still. My friends are. [laughter] [shouting] [upbeat tribal music] [grunting] [upbeat tribal music] [upbeat tribal music] - Hello gentlemen. My name is Dr. Peter Van Hooten, this is my beautiful wife, Irene. - Hi. - And this is our home you broke into tonight. [grunting] - Mother fucker! - Now tonight, we were planning to indoctrinate our daughter, Leslie, with the four human sacrifices she brought us into the cult of Marinette Bras Cheche. She was gonna be a living host for the Ewa. Now an Ewa, as you may well know, or maybe you don't know, an Ewa is a very powerful Haitian spirit that would have guaranteed her prosperity and prosperity for our community for years to come, but you killed her sacrifices. [laughter] But as my beautiful wife likes to say, "When life hands you lemons." - Make lemonade. [grunting] - Get off, get off me man! [shouting] [grunting] [shouting] - [Peter] You know, what's particularly upsetting is that last year, we had a guest who liberated himself temporarily, but the ritual didn't take, so to speak, so this year, we made a very meticulous plan to follow the old rights, which requires four human sacrifices, but because of you guys, we're going to have to improvise again. Honey, hold this for me, just for a second. Hard to get good help these days. [suspenseful music] First, the blood. - No, no, no! Get away from me! Get away from me! [grunting] [suspenseful music] [grunting] [grunting] - [Cliff] You fuck! [suspenseful music] Some fucking body untie me! Untie me! [shouting] [screaming] [upbeat tribal music] [upbeat tribal music] [grunting] No, you stop! - Now you see, the [speaking Haitian] believed that you can summon the Ewa with the head of a black pig, the skin of a black rooster, and the heart of a snake, but because Larry forgot the rooster, it looks like you're gonna have to be. - You sick fuck! You mother fucker, you fuck pig! I'm gonna suck your fucking eyeballs out of your sockets and skull fuck you, you sick fuck! - I'm trying to cut you. - Fuck! Fuck! [shouting] [screaming] [upbeat tribal music] [screaming] [shouting] [screaming] - [Cliff] What are you waiting for, old man? Send me to hell. - I'll see you there. [suspenseful music] [upbeat tribal music] [suspenseful music] [upbeat tribal music] [upbeat tribal music] [suspenseful music] [upbeat tribal music] [upbeat tribal music] - Help me. - And now the heart! - Please, no. [grunting] [suspenseful music] [suspenseful music] [screaming] Great goddess of freedom, great goddess of bondage, she of the forsaken soul, she of the dry arms, we invite you into our child to stay. Please, accept these gifts. [suspenseful music] [speaking Haitian] Are you here? [suspenseful music] - It didn't work. I failed. - No, no, you're still our baby. You're still our baby. [sobbing] [suspenseful music] - We'll try again next year. [suspenseful music] [sobbing] [subtle country music] ♪ I sent away ♪ For a treasure night ♪ It came one day ♪ It was fun for a while ♪ Hm, hm [subtle country music] - [Leslie] Daddy, the door's locked. - Okay dear, I'm coming! [subtle country music] - Oh honey. - Oh, I hate saying goodbyes. - I know dear, but you gotta study if you wanna get your degree, you're gonna make an amazing doctor one day. - But I love spending time up here with you. - We love having you, but school is a priority. - I know. - Okay, not another word, or I'm gonna start misting up too. - I feel horrible. - Don't, it'll work out the next time. - Really? - [Peter] Yes. And remember, your friends all died in a car accident, you're the one that survived. It's all set with the authorities. - Okay dad. - Okay, off you go. [laughter] - You know, I think it's time I meet a nice guy. [laughter] - Well I think you're going to meet Mr. Right one of these days, but this is a tough family for a boy to deal with. - Yeah, just ask John. - [Irene] Peter, Peter, you just, don't be fresh. - All right, all right, I just didn't like him. - Stop it. Stop it you, you did like him. - All right, okay. - Okay. - Say goodbye to Regina. - Dad. [laughter] - Peter, oh Peter get outta here. What, this is an emotional moment, let me have it. - Okay. - Oh darling. Oh sweetheart, you just, you stay safe and you drive carefully. I miss you so much when you're not here. - Okay, okay I'll be safe. - Yes, safe, safe and listen you call me, you call me the minute you get there. - All right, all right, okay. Okay. - Oh. Oh Peter, I feel so bad for her. - It's gonna be okay, she's strong. She'll make it. - You're right, you're always right. Why are you always right? - That's why you married me. - I married you because I love you. - Not for my money? - Oh God no. [laughter] I think I'd like some alone time with my husband. - Oh, well what about the hot chocolate? - Oh, you'll have to work for that. But you are gonna have to work for it. I hope you haven't expended all your energy in the basement. - No, I just have one more grip down there. - And she's not going anywhere.
