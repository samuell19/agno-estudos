Keep quiet, pa You tricked me saying you work for BBC Anu, please wait I liked you very much That's why I lied 'You tricked me saying you work for BBC' 'You call yourself a reporter?' 'Shame on you!' 'I know you have none of the qualifications BBC requires' 'You'll go down the drain obsessing with this damn BBC' 'Joining BBC as a reporter is not only my ambition' 'It is my dad's dream!' 'Though my dad tried many times he couldn't get into BBC' 'He might have lost' 'But I've got to win for both of us' 'There may not be anyone behind a person's victory' 'But there will be zillion failures' 'Only one who fears failure will be afraid to try' 'I am not too sure if I'll get into BBC this time' 'But I'll keep trying till I get it!' Please come Take your seat Thanks Mr Gautham, this opening is for investigative journalism It's all about how deeply you investigate and how well you present the case Mr Gautham We have a case for you to analyze It's a case of a young lady Her name is Irene She was found dead ...having fallen from the 8th floor of her apartment building The door was locked from the inside There were no traces of any visitors on the security cameras Mr Gautham, you need to investigate if this is a suicide or murder And as a journalist how you'll present this information in a sensational way Sir, one more time please One more time? Is it an English film to watch again and tell you the story? It's an interview, man You have a problem with the language That's why you are struggling A girl fell down from the 8th floor and was found dead Main door was locked from the inside Security cameras show no evidence of any intruder As a journalist you need to find out if it's a murder or a suicide How are you going to present it as a sensational news? These South Indian reporters are not capable of presenting in English They can only tell you the gossip on who delivered a baby, who is sleep- Irene, the victim here was found dead... ...jumping from the 8th floor of the City Tower apartment This however is assumed to be a suicide by the City Police But we do have a few clues to prove this isn't a suicide but planned murder! The victim here Irene has freshly painted toenails It is noticed that the toenails on her right leg have been freshly painted While on her left leg... ...only 3 of her toenails were painted leaving 2 unpolished! Also it is seen that the paint bottle is left open on the table of her living room Nobody would ever care to paint their toenails before killing themselves Reports also state that there were no traces of any visitors at the apartment But there are 2 cups of coffee found on the table... ...which shows us that the victim was not alone but had company And this person is assumed to be a friend It's clearly seen that the doors were locked on the inside... ...which clearly shows that he or she was not just a friend But more than a friend to her All the security camera footages have been erased And most of all there were absolutely no signs of struggle Which brings us to the conclusion that this is not a suicide But a very well planned murder This is Gautham Ramalingam for BBC news! English is only a language, sir Not knowledge! That was surprisingly good Of course He was very sharp, sincere I'm impressed That was a brilliant presentation Thank you, sir Congrats, Gautham Stop...stop...stop Let me shake your hand Our channel has been elevated in the world's eyes thanks to you If tomorrow in BBC they ask you about your work experience... ...please mention our channel's name You rock, dude Sorry Not knowing your ambition... ...I derided you To be fair, I should be the one to apologize Will you come to this channel hereafter? I don't know Why do you ask? Just like that Anyway...congrats! Dude, when's the treat? He wants a treat For sure...a huuuge one! "This dude, he was then single Now he is done for as double!" "He was like tea in a Nair's shop Now cappuccino with cream on top" "Till yesterday a local ordinary Now with style extra-ordinary" "Into her eyes teeny-weeny she dragged me daringly" "Into her heart so gigantic she crammed me romantic" "Aiyo alas dear me!

She is hot, sweet flavor Life is set now a treat to savor" "Aiyo alas dear me! Shucks wow whoopee!!" "Country bumpkin is now tip top Jeepers jeez what a hop!" Why are you looking at me like that? No...you've got huuge eyes Big ears Big nose But tiny lips Decent body If I look at you piecemeal... ...you're quite boring! But if I look at you as a whole piece... ...you are awesome All beautiful girls will fall in love only with uninteresting guys Prove it Okay Usually no girl will trust her boyfriend But when we first met... ...you didn't know who I was You believed all my lies Do you know why?

Document of this house Sell it at whatever price you can get Whatever can be sold from this house... ...sell everything and convert it to cash Let's pay the amount due in court first Let us not stay in this house any longer We will go to a place where no one recognizes us How can you be so stupid? If you sell everything... ...pay the court and leave this place ...will all your problems be solved? Nothing will be solved! 16 years of your son's education... ...has become nothing today Court has stamped his certificate as fake To this world, your son and an illiterate bum are one and the same Nobody will employ him Maybe he could become a laborer Within a week submit all your documents And you know that it is an international television company Without proper documents we can do nothing! Your graduation certificate is a must Gautham These are the case files I've collected so far Here, read it In this case... ...don't think only you 5 got caught 2 years ago... ...4 boys in Trichy got caught In the same way 3 boys from Madurai And 2 from Coimbatore We still don't know how many invisible students are still around Every single person caught in this case... ...studied in different schools They belong to different towns Absolutely no similarities among any of you But there is 1 common factor That is... ...fake certificate! All the educational loans have been taken using these fake certificates Find out who is behind this Don't think like a victim Think like a reporter! What happened? The photos in the original certificate ...and the fake certificate we saw in the police station are one and the same Not only that All the loan documents have the same photo Bloody rogues! That means your certificate and photo... ...were both leaked out by your college No chance of certificates in Govt colleges going out Without coming out in some way how can this be forged? Sir, Anna university- Balaji I've used the same photo and certificate somewhere else other than my college Where? Dot Consultancy Anna Nagar - Where? - This building It is locked Madam...florist This office is closed They aren't working today? It has been closed for many days, sir What are you doing? I'm inquiring, right? You broke the lock I'm in uniform too If someone questions us, shouldn't we know what to say? She's saying it has been closed for a long time But the lock is new How come? So without anyone's knowledge someone has been coming here Open the door Watch your step What's this? This place looks huge Search every nook and corner Don't miss even a single paper Searched every square inch here Couldn't find even a single clue I told you right then Your certificate must have leaked only from your college Don't lose your cool Gautham What is this? Someone else has a certificate in your name It looks exactly like the original All are fake certificates M.B.B.S certificate is also here Gautham, look here So many seals M.G.R. Medical University Anna University Kamaraj University Pondicherry University All their seals are here But to get loan from the bank a certificate alone isn't enough They will need other documents too But only certificates are here This doesn't make sense Don't you understand? They haven't got just loans like what we think They are selling these fake certificates This gang is churning out these fake certificates Why should the seller leave the certificates here? Because all these are damaged Look at these minor printing mistakes How can these be mistakes? They aren't like the other gangs They are thorough professionals If my guess is right... ...in the name of consultancy ...they collect a student's original details, certificates and photos And print the fake certificates to match the original certificate What do you mean by match? I don't get it Okay, your name is Senthil In Tamil Nadu alone, there are 52 Govt and private universities Under these 52 universities are approximately 2000 colleges In these 2000 colleges at least 1 chap named Senthil would have studied So with this match they steal the original certificate details And print as a fake document In 1 name, there are many fake certificates Look at those 2 certificates The register numbers match Same name And the same degree But the photos... ...are very different All the certificates are ditto like this What's the advantage of matching the original certificate and selling? No one will get caught in the background verification Both the buyers and the sellers of the certificates are safe Wretched fellows! God knows how many quack doctors are wandering around our country now We must find this gang and arrest them immediately All the certificates have photos attached, right? We can nab them with that Won't be able to trace them with just their photos Because who knows where they work, in which office or in which city We don't know who they are, where they live, what they do Zilch But wherever they are... ...we don't have to find them They will come looking for us Why would they? Let me explain In Tamil Nadu there are totally 48 TV channels including ours In these 48 channels, we will know some reporters directly Reporters they know, friends, friends of friends There is bound to be at least 1 such person Let's make use of them Senthil, mail these details to them immediately Most importantly, in all the channels... ...it should be telecast on the same day, the same way without variation Why at the same time? Only then they won't be able to find out who we are Gautham No need...this might have some grave repercussions! We are doing this only for the problem to erupt All that is fine What is your content for all the channels? 'In the raid conducted by the special police force in Chennai...' '...it has been found fake certificate holders are working' '...in Govt and private sectors' 'If you are aware of any detail regarding any of the faces here...' '...then please inform the police department at once' 'Name Ramakrishnan Age 32' 'Madras University Masters degree' 'Year 2000' 'Name Syed Akram Age 29' 'Anna Univer-' Hello? I saw your face on TV What are you blabbering? They are showing all your certificates Certificate...? 'Name Sukumar Age 33' 'Annamalai University' 'M.B.B.S certificate' 'Year 2002' 'Name Venkatesh Age 30' 'Madras University' 'Masters certificate' 'Year 2008' 'Name Srinivasan Age 27' 'Bharathidasan University' 'Year 1999' 'Anthony Sridhar Age 27' 'Madurai Kamaraj University Undergraduate certificate' How many on the whole? 52, dad But the Police department didn't conduct any raid! No one has filed any report either This is fake news We don't have to be scared of this We should be scared only if it's fake news Is there any similarity among these 52? There isn't any common link at all They belong to different departments They haven't even seen each other!
