You're still alive. (laughing) He's gonna be shitting oil for a week. (melodic music) (Mother Trucker laughing) And breathing, it's gonna be a bitch. Well, shit. (laughing) (footsteps thudding) Your turn. What's your name? - Angel. - So tell me, Angel, Angel, Angel, Angel, Angel, do you believe in angels, Angel, mm? You better believe in angels, because you're staring at the devil's eyes right now. This devil's gonna clip off those wings and drop you straight into the fires of hell. ♪ When I've lost it all ♪ - [Mother Trucker] So tell me, Angel, do you still believe in angels? - Yes. (crying) - Look at me, bitch. - Please. - You know, I'm getting tired of people saying that, it means nothing. I'm sick of hearing it. (Angel whimpering) Are you having fun yet? (wall banging) (Angel whimpering) (Ethan spitting) - Oh, what's this? I thought angels supposed to be pure? Another fucking liar. Maybe I can help. You know, mm-mm, hmm. Now hold still. (Ethan spitting) (chest creaking) Now normally, these are used to brand horses and cows, this is really gonna hurt. (blowtorch hissing) But I'm pretty sure this'll burn that tattoo right off your skin. Burn. (Angel screaming) - No. Get the fuck off her. (Alexis screaming) (Mother Trucker laughing) - Stop. - Well. - I'm gonna fucking kill you. - Now, I was just gonna do one tattoo, now I'm curious, do you have any more? - No. - Got any more tattoos? - [Mother Trucker] Then why, what you trying to hide? Well, oh, got another one, huh? How about we burn that one too? Guess we gotta burn this one too. (Angel screaming) - No. - I'm gonna haunt you in hell. (spitting) - Anything else you'd like to say? - No. - What's my name? I want you to call me Mother Trucker. Oh, that's a good girl, yeah. (Angel crying) You having fun yet? Smile, this could be much, much worse. Mason, right? And how you doing, brother? I know you've been dying to join the party. I like to keep it fresh, keep it exciting, like, "What is he gonna do next?" You tried to run me over with your fucking car. So how about we have a little fun? I got something special for you, dumb fuck. - That wasn't my car. - (laughing) Not your car? Like that's gonna change a mother fucking thing. (suspenseful music) So why don't we just tie that into this equation, boy? I got something for ya from my chest of tricks. (battery thudding) (ominous music) (electricity sparking) Well, shit, I've done a lot of unimaginable things to Taylor here. I really thought she'd be around a little while longer. I'd say Ethan's insides are on fire, Angel has been branded. Let's see, what am I gonna do next? (laughing) (electricity sparking) Oh yeah. - What are you gonna do, attach those to my dick? - (laughing) I ain't got tweezers, boy. (electricity sparking) Now, Mason, I'm not trying to fulfill your sexual fantasies, you sick fuck. All right. (laughing) (Angel whimpering) - Get it over with. - Yeah. (electricity sparking) (Mason screaming) Whoo, yeah. (Mason screaming) You fry, I want you to fry, sucker. (Mason screaming) That's it, boy, fry. (Mason screaming) Whoo. (Mason groaning) Whoo.

Still beating, take a little more? - No, he's gonna kill me. - We'll never know unless we try. (electricity sparking) How you like that? (Mason screaming) - No, no. - Yeah. (Mason groaning) Whoo. (Mason screaming) - Fucking bastard. (crying) - There you guys go again, lying through your fucking teeth. (electricity sparking) I'm no bastard, my parents were married when they had me. - Your parents dropped you on your fucking head. - Say something about my parents again, I dare you. - They dropped you on your fucking head. (Mother Trucker screaming) - Can't you see I'm trying to sleep, go feed yourself. (Mother Trucker crying) - Stop crying, you little shit. (knee thudding) (Mother Trucker gasping) (Mother Trucker screaming) (electricity sparking) - Listen to me, you have no right to talk about my parents, you piece of shit. (Mother Trucker grunting) (punch thudding) (heavy music) You are a hurtful bunch of ungrateful teenagers. (laughing) You're probably spoonfed in your Hollywood mansion, never a worry in your life. Am I right, Alexis? - You're right. - [Mother Trucker] Finally, some fucking honesty around here. Was that so hard? - You don't have to do this. - (laughing) Oh really? Well, what are you and I gonna do? Ride off to Mexico with a sunset together? Get married? Have some kids? - If that's what you want. - Well, I'm not too sure how he's gonna feel about that. (laughing) - [Angel] Alexis, what are you doing? - I mean it, just the two of us. - I know you're just fucking with me, just like these other liars. Just maybe I may entertain that idea. I guess that means I gotta be a little nicer to you, but not your friends though. - Whatever it takes, baby. - Self-preservation. Is it all a ruse to save your own ass while turning on your friends, or is this the part where the victim sympathizes with their captors? Good old case of, what the fuck they call it? Stockholm syndrome. Well, if that's the case, yay me. Mm, mm. Well, as much fun as we've been having, we've been sitting here way too long. Time to get trucking. (footsteps thudding) I'm sure someone's looking for you dipshits right about now. (door banging) [Detective Ford] - Found another one. It's broken. [Detective Cooper] - This one too. (garbled radio chattering) (Detective Cooper sighing) This is where we lost signal, there's gotta be another one around here somewhere. - We've gotten so close. I hate it when the trail ends. - It's all fucking desert. (truck engine whirring) [Angel] - What the fuck was that, Alexis? Are you serious? [Alexis] - It worked, didn't it? - You didn't mean it, did you? Ethan is barely alive over here. - Of course I didn't. What the hell else was I supposed to do? - Still, that was fucked. [Mason] - Maybe I should see if he's gay. Fuck, I don't know. At least one of us will get outta here alive. - [Alexis] I'm sorry, I didn't know what else to do. - We come to same to you, (scoffing) and we get fucked. [Ethan] - Leave her alone. - Ethan. Ethan, I was so scared. - It's okay. - Are you okay? - It hurts so fucking much. (Alexis sighing) (truck engine roaring) - (sighing) Just need to get one of these off.

He's full of buckshot, all scarred up, can barely walk, can't even move. (chains rattling) So I really think he's got to go. - Just let him. - No. - Just let him go. - He's not gonna be walking anywhere anytime soon, trust me. - [Ethan] Help, help. - (laughing) Where do you think you're going? Nobody here to hear you. (Alexis crying) Nope, nothing but coyotes out here, son. You're in the middle of a desert, what are you doing? One thing you have to understand, kid, is I've been doing this a long time. I move from town to town, state to state, I'm good at this. Nobody, I mean, nobody has even been close to catching me. - You're going, - (laughing) Going to what? Are you gonna finish that sentence? Come on, Ethan, you gonna finish it?
