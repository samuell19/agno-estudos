[mooing] [driving noises] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] REPORTER: A relative discovered the murder victims Friday on this farmstead south of Humboldt. The victims were Teena Brandon of Lincoln, Phillip Devine of Fairfield, Iowa, and Lisa Lambert of Humbolt. She lived at the farmhouse with her infant son, who was not harmed in the attack. The official briefing did not explain what could have sparked the slayings or what the other two victims were doing at Lisa Lambert's house. The county attorney did reveal one strange detail. Teena Brandon posed as a man named Brandon. [theme music] DAPHNE: Brandon was a woman's man. I mean, every woman's dream. Every woman's dream. If, um, Brandon really was a man, oh, Jesus. He would have women after him all the time. I mean, he knew how to please you. He knew how to do everything right. -Oh, yeah. Good kisser. I can't say so much for lover, because we didn't really make love. You know what I mean? But yeah, an excellent kisser. Excellent. Excellent guy. Excellent, you know? Knew exactly how a woman wanted to be treated, you know? Knew exactly how I wanted to be treated. -I can't remember if it was a dozen or two dozen roses sitting there and it had a card and it had a little stuffed cat next to it. A bottle of perfume. I'm like, what is all this stuff? He's like, well, will you marry me? So I probably thought about it for a minute. I said, yeah. And he just starts jumping up and down, you know, oh, yeah, yeah. -And girls would go-- right? -Right. -They'd go, oh my God. The guy's in the kitchen cooking with me. I mean, that's the way Tenna was. Because the beautiful thing about Tenna was he was in touch with his female side and his male side. He knew what females wanted because he was a female at one time. And he knew what males wanted because now he was a male. It was great. -I thought Brandon was attractive when I thought it was Brandon until I found out that Brandon is Teena. Teena Renae instead of Tenna Rae Brandon. When I found all that out, I was like, oh god, what am I doing? -People have said, you know, this person is a female. This person-- I said, but we're sleeping together. That doesn't matter. You know, here I'm so naive to anything. It's like, you know, what's a strap on? What's this? What's that? I have no idea what you're talking about, you know? And like, well, strap on, you know, feel-- feel behind the leg. See if it's strapped on somehow. I'm like, well, OK. Whatever, you know? So I'm like, OK. You have to take your pants off this time. They-- just take them off. So I thought, well, I'll feel. So, you know, down his back, down past, you know, his legs. Well, there's nothing there. And I'm thinking, his hands aren't there to try to keep it in place. His hands are up, you know, by my head, under my head or whatever. So I thought, these people. Just feeding me all this crap. I'm like, I'm not going to listen to them. You know? So I have no idea-- I no idea why it worked so well. GINA: He'd come up with stories, you know, more sex change stories and that-- it got to the point where almost nothing's been done. You know, we go from everything to, you know, half of it, to now where it's just barely starting. And I said, you know, you just need to be honest with me. And so he-- he showed me. And he says, well, but this is the start of the operation. The start of what? He's like, well, they've sewn me up and started-- started me on steroids. And saying how they've implanted something that's going to eventually grow. -And I'm like, hermaphrodite? What are you talking about? I went home and looked it up in the dictionary. I had no idea. What is a hermaphrodite, you know? And I'm like, so what's this mean? You know? And it says something about an animal in the dictionary. So I was, like, really freaking out. I'm dating an animal? -How could you lie to me, you know? Here I've got a hickey on my neck. And everybody's just laughing at me, because you lied to me and you pretended to be someone you're not. I was mad for probably a good two weeks. And then I start talking to him as a she again. JOANN: Is it true? Is it true? Is he a boy? Is he really a girl? I was kissing him in the backseat last night. Is he a girl? And Tenna's standing right next to me. I said, would you like to talk to her? Would you like to explain what's going on? (WHISPERING) No, no. You do it. Don't tell her. Don't tell her. Oh, god, I'll kill myself if you do. I'll kill myself. I believed him. NARRATOR: Changes I'm going through in my life will change me forever. Soon, I'll have anybody I want and give them the love that I have. But there's one that won't leave my mind. Maybe I should walk away and find someone else and start over, knowing the mistakes I've made, and make them change. I still love her so, but I should let her go. One of these nights, I'll close my eyes and let everything go. I'm not as strong as I thought. I can't fight. I don't think I can make it alone. By Brandon. -I figured some guy would find out that she was female, you know, if he didn't know right away and just rape her, you know. And it was-- what do I want to say? I kind of felt like it would happen, but I didn't. I was trying to put the fear of god in her, you know, more or less, just to-- because people are cruel. -Basically, we were getting worried about Teena and we couldn't get any help for her. And you know, not help to deal with her being gay or anything like that, but help to deal with her, you know, trying to figure out herself and stuff. Maybe she needed some counseling. And she had mentioned to us one time about committing suicide, so we kind of used that as a reason of getting her to there. They took her to Lincoln General. And the psychologist there said that Teena needed long-term help. Which I don't know if that was really the case. But they did send her out to the crisis center. And I don't know. You know, I wish I really knew what Teena had told them or what those doctors had told Teena. But basically, she came out of there saying, I want a sex change. And, you know, they told me I need to do this and that. And they might have told her that, but I don't know if that's really what she wanted to do. -I think he had in his head that he was going to get a sex change or something and he just wanted everybody to know him as always being a man. This is a man, you know, or whatever, you know? And I think that he wanted everybody to know that. So therefore he had to lie. And then he would get caught in lies, so we have to say lie after lie to cover up lies. So he was just living one big lie. -And he would just scream at you-- scream at me, saying, Gina, this isn't a gay relationship. I don't know what you're thinking. I said, well, what am I supposed to think? I mean, I know what you want to be is male. I said, but unfortunately, we have to deal with what we have now. And I said, you are female. And I said, we have to deal with that. Because every time he tried to be truthful to the kids he was with, he was put down. He was called a fag. Or worse yet, or you're a dyke. Or you're really a lesbo. That's what you are. You're a lesbo. We don't want to be around you. Or the girls would just look at him and call him a freak. Sometimes Tenna would buy your love. And it wasn't through the forgeries or the stealing, then it was by doing anything for you that he could do. It was always like he was this little puppy dog following you, waiting to get patted on the head. Oh, good boy. Good boy. You did a good job. -Everything was just sweet about him, you know? Everything-- he had-- always buying stuff for people. Always. Like roses and always pizzas. Movies. Anything that you would want, he would buy it for you, you know? JOANN: He never looked at it like it was stealing. He was doing it to help somebody. But it always got him in trouble. You can give that boy a checkbook and money. -The funniest thing was, he had bought me an engagement ring set on that card. It was the actual gold band with the-- the other ring being the diamond solitaire. You know, at this time, I've already figured out this is my card. He was like, well, I bought this for you. I was like, with what? With my money. And I said, you did no such thing. I said, you're giving me a ring that I just bought myself. Am I right? And he's just like, well, keep it. I want you to keep it. I'm not keeping this. And so we'd argued and fought over that. And I'd-- just take the ring. And I just threw it at him. I don't want it. I do not want it. I said, tell you what. Right now, you know, engagement's off. It is off. -And then single girls-- straight girls-- would be, ah! I was making out with a girl? Oh! And then the phone calls and the harassment would start. And that's when Tenna finally left. Because too many people found out that, um, he was a girl. [music playing] Falls City is a white community. We may have had one or two families in here that were black, but as far as, uh, having gay people come in, you know, Falls City would, I'm sure, you know, escort 'em out of town. -They have barely any jobs. A lot of 'em are on welfare and stuff. You know, I mean, you know, if you've got somebody that gots a job and keeps a job, you know, especially a girl that don't get-- end up up pregnant and end up on welfare for the rest her life, you're pretty damn lucky, you know. So that's, uh, that's Fall City for ya. -I believe this county seems to have more than it's-- more than it's share of, uh, violent crimes for as small an area as it is. And I worked in three other departments, you know, before coming back to here. And I don't believe any of those places-- which were also Nebraska-- had near the domestic violence that we do down here, like stabbing calls. Assault calls. You know, pretty-- pretty bad vi-- you know, violent calls in general. It's-- it's a lot different than, you know, what you might think. [music playing] LANA TISDEL: We're smiling. Brandon's looking. That's his typical face right there. His face that I seen all the time. He shaved. Um, He would sit like a man. And he would talk about women, like pretty women on TV. Um, his favorite woman he thought was really beautiful was Cher. He thought she was gorgeous. I mean, that was the woman to him. I don't know. He'd sit around and talk about cars, like men do. Gets really boring, hearing about-- men talking about cars. MICHELLE LOTTER: After she had had sex with him and she said that she'd never do it again because he was so small and all that stuff. I was like, don't let that stop you. So that-- that's not a big deal. I was just like, you need to keep this one. Because he was-- he'd, like, I don't know. He was so nice to her. He'd like, leave her notes, you know? Like little love letters laying around. Just-- he was just really nice. He did everything to please her. -Brandon was a very polite person. Uh, Brandon didn't talk bad about anybody. And he was very considerate to my daughter, Lana. And he was very clean. You know, I-- I did-- I liked him. He was very appealing for a young man. -We went out drinking together. We talked about women. We'd ride around, saying, woo, what about that one? Mm, what about that one there? You know, just guy talk. -The wool was pulled over a number of people's eye's, you know. And she was-- done it well. And one thing I noticed, all the girls saying that she knew how to treat a girl. He knew how to treat a girl. And I presume that the way she-- she would like to be treated, you know, with flowers and all this stuff. And she knew what a girl would like. -Found out it was really nice being treated like a lady instead of just like a-- like nothing. Like dirt. There-- there was a difference. It was nice for what it was. -She was hermaphrodite. She was born with both sexes. She had had a partial operation to get rid of her upper part and that she was going to get the lower taken care of later. First she told me it was all taken care of, that she was a full-fledged male, is what she told me. That's her exact words. JOHN LOTTER: You know, Lana introduced me to-- you know, and they were seeing each other, you know, supposedly dating each other. And said this is Tenna Rae Brandon, you know. Whatever. You know, as far as I knew, he was a guy. You know, I-- at that time, you know. I mean, now, I mean, if-- I'll look, you know. I'll say, is there an Adam's apple there? Or I'll check for things. But, you know, I mean-- then, I mean, you know, somebody says this is a guy, especially somebody that I've, you know, known for since she was in diapers. You know, I'm not going to sit there and say, OK, this ain't no guy. You know, I ain't looking for it, you know. -He was just like, god, I've got to pee. And I'm like, you want me to pull over? No. He just stood up. Peed out the window. While we were moving. I was like, you're not peeing on the side of my truck, are you? No, no, no. It's OK. I haven't seen a girl yet that could pee out my window. -A lot of people were upset because she stealing from people, too. She was taking checks and taking money and forging and, you know, stuff like that. So a lot of people were upset with her for that. -She needed money. Had no, you know, source of income and she was forging checks. And from my understanding, it wasn't the first time she had forged checks. It, uh, it had happened up in Lincoln and that's why the Lincoln personnel was able to give me some information about her, because she had forged checks up there. -I was like, well, if he's not Brandon then who is he? And she said, Brandon is not a he. Brandon is a she. And Brandon's real name is Teena Brandon. And I just kind of looked and I went, what? Like, yes, it is a woman. Not a man. I was like, there's no way. I said, that is not a woman. I said, doesn't even look like a woman. -I don't think in the beginning they realized it, but after I made the arrest and charged her as a female-- girls down at Fall City, I informed them that she was in jail. And they said, what do you mean she? And I said, well, Brandon is a female. And they said, no, she's not. And I said, yes, she is. And that's when it first got out down at Fall City that she was really a female. And I don't know if they really believed it or not. But, uh, well, I would say, in some sense, is a lot of people didn't believe. But they sure wondered. And, uh, I don't know. It just got worse. NARRATOR: December 21, 1993. Dear Mom, I do not know if you know were I'm at now or what I'm doing. Well, you can quit guessing, and let me tell you. As of right now, I'm in the Falls City county jail. I've been here for six days. I turned myself in. I'm tired of running from my problems and people. I've been so lost lately I can't even cry. I was sick last night. I was throwing up. I've lost 5 pounds in here, but I did pull ups and push ups and tightened up my muscles. Well, gotta go. Love you always and forever, Brandon. -Lana's father gave her a-- a check with his-- just his signature on it. She was to go to a beauty shop and get herself a perm. Well, Brandon was in jail. She went ahead and took the check to Hinky Dinky's and wrote it out for $250, which was enough bond to get Brandon out of jail. She tried to get him out of jail, and she could not do it, because at that time she was only, I believe, 18, or she was not old enough to do it. So she gave Tom Nissen the money, and Tom went and bonded Brandon out. And they went to Tom Nissen's house, and this is where they stayed. -He wrote this-- I think it was the night Brandon got out of jail. Flashing you is not the easy-- is not that easy. I wish you could understand. I'm not yet comfortable with myself. I will never try to hurt you, and I want to leave because I am not wanted here. And it's the same shit. And I want to leave so you have no more hell either. Just so you are not worried. I do understand how you feel and your situation. I'm so sorry. I just want it to be a moment where I am not pressured and forced. That scares me and makes me more uncomfortable. Sorry. Love, Brandon. He wrote this the night I got Brandon out of jail. [music playing] -Leave him there, you know? Just let him serve his time. Then he can get the hell out of here. I said, what does he think he's doing, bringing this shit to a small town like this, you know? And he just needs to get the fuck out of here. I told her. I said, something's going to happen if he don't get out of here. I was mad at him, but I was worried about what would happen to him if he stayed there. -It-- just a big concern was Brandon's gender, between Lana, Lana's mom, and Lana's dad. LINDA GUTIERRES: I was very upset with it. I did not want Lana in the situation with Brandon any longer. So I left the bar and went to Tom Nissen's house. And Brandon and I went into the back bedroom. And I was talking to Brandon. I says, just prove to me right now if you are a man or woman. I says, I don't care. I says, all I want to know is the truth. Brandon unsnapped his pants and pulled them down just so far where I could see there was a hairline. Some hair. But Brandon wouldn't do it-- wouldn't continue showing me. And about that time, Tom Nissen walked into the bedroom, and he says, Brandon, just pull your pants down and show her. That's all she wants to know. -Yeah, she didn't like Brandon. She didn't, and either did Linda, and either did Melissa. Only one did was Lana, because she was just so, really-- I mean, she-- actually, she was really brainwashed. And I think even still today, she's probably still half-assed brainwashed. I mean, I wouldn't be surprised if she's still calling him a he. He, he. And knowing damn well it's a she. -I-- I don't know what the big thing was. But the cops told me and Brandon, go in the room for me to find out and all this. So me and Brandon went in there. You know, and he unbuttoned his pants and everything. I said, Brandon, you don't have to do that. I said, I'm not going to look. I said, I'm going to tell them what we want them to know and what we believe. I walked out there and they said, so, do you know? Is he a woman or a man? And I said, he is a man. They said, did you see? And I said, yes, I've seen it in the flesh. I said, that is a full man. Now leave him alone. -Brandon says, I'd never hurt Lana. And-- but yet, Brandon still didn't want to reveal the truth. That's about the only thing we talked and yelled about. I even shoved back-- Brandon back into the dresser, just pushed him backwards into the dresser. And the dresser hit the window and cracked the window. But I was only there acting as a concerned mother. I wasn't there to cut him down or do any of that. I just really wanted the truth. -My mom was disgusted. She-- she couldn't believe it. She kept on wanting me to get away from him and all this. Because she said them kind of people have AIDS. And I told her no, he does not have AIDS. -I think it was just such a big shock, you know, finding out that somebody that had told us the he was a man and made everybody believe. Slept with my best friend, you know? Find out that this is a woman. It's just knowing that somebody could get into your mind like that and I don't know, just manipulate you like that. Making you think a totally different thing than what's really happening. You know, nothing that he'd ever told us was true, obviously. Everything was a lie. You just-- it just totally blew everybody's mind. [music playing] [music playing] -Well, Tom grabbed Brandon. Tom had his arms under Brandon like this, was holding him like this, with his arms like this. And then John undid his pants and pulled them down to his ankles. INTERVIEWER: So what did you-- what did you do? -Well, the first thing I did was covered my eyes. I covered my eyes, and I kind of turned around. And John said, well, you better look, because if you don't, we're going to hold him like this until you do look. And so I turned around. I had my eyes like this, and I turned around and I peeked a little bit. Then I covered 'em and I turned back around. SHERIFF LAUX: Tom held your arms. Which way was he standing, beside you, behind you, or what? And how'd he hold you. BRANDON: My arms up. SHERIFF LAUX: Then he took and Tom or, ah, John undone your pants, right? He pulled your pants down how far? BRANDON: Past my knees. SHERIFF LAUX: Past your knees. How far did he pull your underpants down? BRANDON: Past my knees. SHERIFF LAUX: And what did you have in your underpants? Nothing in your underpants? BRANDON: Are you talking about earlier when I had a sock, but not when he pulled my pants down. I didn't. SHERIFF LAUX: You didn't have a sock. Do you run around once in a while with a sock in your pants to make you look like a boy? BRANDON: Yeah. SHERIFF LAUX: All right. So after he pulled your pants down and seen you were a girl, what did he do? Did he fondle you any? BRANDON: No. SHERIFF LAUX: He didn't fondle you any, huh? Didn't that kind of amaze you? After he pulled your pants down and been wanting to take you to bed and you told him no, that you was a boy and you couldn't do that? Doesn't that kind of get your attention somehow, that he would put his hands in your pants and play with you a little bit? Huh? BRANDON: I don't know what he did. SHERIFF LAUX: I can't believe that if he pulled your pants down and you're a female that he didn't stick his hands in you or his finger in you. BRANDON: Well, he didn't. SHERIFF LAUX: I can't believe he didn't. -Tom was pulling down her pants and he put his finger up there and said, oh, there's-- you know, there's something. You know, there ain't nothing there. She's a girl, you know. And I said, well, I saw something. You know, I looked at Brandon and I said, what was that I saw? You know. Just playing it off, you know. -So he reached over and grabbed Brandon. Grabbed him by the neck and was holding him. And he couldn't breathe. And Brandon kept on looking to me and I think was trying to say help, but he couldn't get it out because John was so tight on his throat. Well, I got John's hand, you know, I was prying his hand off his throat. And I got his hand off his throat, you know, and Brandon was talking about his throat and everything, because I can imagine. You know, John's hand, you know, on his throat. And I asked Brandon, I said, Brandon, they say my mom just want over to the house and that she wants me to come home. But I can come back. She just wants to talk to me. I said, is it OK? I said, If you don't want me to go, I won't go. I will stay here with you. And he said, that's OK. Just go. But don't leave me. Come back. I said, I will be back. I said, is it OK if Tom stays in here with you? And he said, yeah, that's fine. Because Tom hasn't really done anything to him, except for, you know, the depantsing. But I wouldn't think he was scared of Tom. I'd think it was more John. And so I left, but Tom stayed there with him. BRANDON: Tom looked at me and he said, John and I need to talk to you. I said, OK, and we walked to the bathroom. Walked in the bathroom and John turned around and held the door and Tom hit me once. I fell in the tub. Stood back up and he it me again. This time I fell on the floor. He kicked me in the ribs I don't know how many times. He stepped on my back. Then he picked me up by my coat and carried me out to the car by my coat. I got in the back seat. That's when I knew something was going to happen. I asked them why. I did beg with them. I did plead. Tom told me, are you going to make this easy or are you going to make this hard? Then he goes-- in fact, he said that either you can get the shit beat out of you and then have it happen anyway. SHERIFF LAUX: Have what happen? BRANDON: When he raped me. -I mean, you guys can sit there and shake your fucking heads no, but I told you. I told both of you. Well, not both of you, because I don't think I talked to you on the phone. But Susan, I told you on the phone, there's going to be some things I cannot answer because they could endanger, or whatever, my appeal process. -He wasn't even on top of her yet. You know, he was, uh, doing something with-- getting something out of a coat and stuff, which I found out later was a rubber. You know, and, uh, you know. And then, you know, a little bit later, he was out of the car and he came to me, you know, and said, well, you know, do you wanna go back there? And stuff like that, you know. And I went back. You know, it was stupid. And I went back, you know. But I didn't have sex with her. I went back there and I tried, but I couldn't keep it up. To drunk. Thinking of my fiancee at the time too much. And I couldn't get it up. SHERIFF LAUX: So when they got ready to poke you, how was you positioned in the back seat? BRANDON: On my back. SHERIFF LAUX: You was on your back? Where did they try to pop it in first at? BRANDON: My vagina. SHERIFF LAUX: They tried sticking it in your vagina, and you say you never had sex before. Is that correct? BRANDON: Right. SHERIFF LAUX: And which one tried doing this first? BRANDON: Tom. SHERIFF LAUX: And Tom couldn't get it in you? Huh? BRANDON: He said he couldn't, but it still hurt. SHERIFF LAUX: He said he couldn't you? BRANDON: He said he couldn't get it in, but all I know is it hurt. I couldn't tell the difference. Whatever he was doing, it hurt. -I did ejaculate in-- in-- in the rubber because of the-- going up and down and the rubbing, you know. When I did get it up, trying to proceed to put it-- you know, have sex with her. But, uh, every time it'd go down. And because of that, you know, I, you know, ejaculated. And I said, fuck it, and got up, you know? SHERIFF LAUX: The first one was Tom, is that correct? BRANDON: Yes, sir. SHERIFF LAUX: Then Tom got out and what'd he do? BRANDON: He got in the passenger seat in front. SHERIFF LAUX: Then what happened? BRANDON: John got out of the driver's seat and went to the passenger side and got in the back seat. SHERIFF LAUX: And then when John got in the back seat, what'd he do? BRANDON: He did everything that Tom did. SHERIFF LAUX: All right. After he got his pants down, he got a spread of you, or had you spread out and he got a spread of you then. Then what happened? BRANDON: When he finished, he got out of the car and got back in the driver's door. SHERIFF LAUX: Well, how did-- let's back up here for a second. First of all, you didn't say anything about him getting it up. Did he have are hard on when he got back there, or what? BRANDON: I don't know. I didn't look. SHERIFF LAUX: You didn't look. Well, did he take a little time working it up, or what? Did you work it up for him? BRANDON: No, I didn't. SHERIFF LAUX: You didn't work it up for him? BRANDON: No. SHERIFF LAUX: Then do you think he had it worked up on his own, or what? BRANDON: I guess so. I don't know. SHERIFF LAUX: And you never had any sex before? BRANDON: No. SHERIFF LAUX: How old are you? BRANDON: 21. SHERIFF LAUX: And if you're 21, you think you'd have-- you'd have trouble getting it in? -You know, she was very, very quiet. She didn't say nothing. You know, she said ouch a few times. You know? You know, that's it. You know? BRANDON: Tom said, nobody will hear about this, all right? I said, yeah. Tom said, get out of the car. Walked to the back. That's when he badly attacked me again. Never hit me in the face this time or in the head. He just hit me in the gut or the back. I think he hit me about three times and the rest of the time he used his knee into my gut. Then Tom goes, we're done. Get in the car. So I had to sit back in the front seat with them. He goes, we're still friends? SHERIFF LAUX: Then what'd you say? BRANDON: I said, yeah. Then we went back to Falls City. Went to Tom's house. -I felt ashamed. I felt ashamed that-- that someone would make alleged charges against me that I had participated in a rape. -Her biggest fear-- -Was rape. ---was to be touched by a man, to possibly be raped by a man, because she was a man. The very thought of a man touching her body erotically made her vomit and terrified her. Absolutely terrified her. She said, I would be just sick if a man kissed me or touched me. And it happened. -Well, I opened the door and it was Brandon. And he was out of breath. He was cold. He had a big, old, fat lip. It was bloody and yucky and he had no shoes on. No shoes at all. He had one shirt on. And he usually wears two. He wears a t-shirt and a shirt over it. And the only shirt he had on was the shirt he wears over the t-shirt. And his pants were all dirty and he was just-- he can't hardly breathe. And I asked him what happened. And that's when he said, you know, they beat the shit out of me. I said, who. And he said, Tom. And then later on, after it got easier for him, he said Tom beat the shit out of him and John raped him. And he said, well, they both raped me, but Tom is the only one that beat the shit out of me. -Brandon did not want to, uh, turn it into the cops or anything. And I told Brandon, I says, I-- I-- I don't care, you know, what you do with your life or what you want to be. It's your business. I don't care. I says, but nobody, Brandon, nobody deserves to be raped. Well, I didn't-- not raped, but kidnapped and taken out there and beaten. Because I didn't know at that time that Brandon was actually raped. SHERIFF LAUX: No, what I'm saying is this. I think you misunderstood my question. Did they do it one time to you and then the other guy do it one time and quit, or did the one guy do it and then the other guy do it and then the other guy come back and do it again and the other guy come back and do it again? BRANDON: They each did it once. SHERIFF LAUX: They each did it once. Do you want to file charges against these guys? BRANDON: Yes. SHERIFF LAUX: Do you want to sign a complaint against them? BRANDON: Yes. SHERIFF LAUX: Will you testify in court against them? BRANDON: Yes, sir. -I confronted them. And, uh, I told them what Brandon's accusations were. And they were trying to tell me it was a bunch of bull. And then when I brought up the DLSes, well, it's been reported, and if you guys did anything, you better get rid of your evidence. I did say that. And Tom went to the kitchen, got a pan of soapy water and a rag, and came back into the room on the north side of the living room and washed up a little spot on the floor and on the wall. But I went there because I didn't believe Brandon. And then when I saw Tom do that, I knew for sure then that they were responsible for doing all this. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Let's talk about the assault of Teena Brandon. Did you physically assault Teena Brandon in your home on December 25? TOM NISSEN: No. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Did you punch her? TOM NISSEN: Yeah. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Did you kick her? TOM NISSEN: Not that I recall. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: When you were out in the country with Teena Brandon before you sexually assaulted her, did you punch and kick her? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Did you hit her about the face? TOM NISSEN: Excuse me, I did not kick her. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: I'm sorry. Did you beat-- did you beat her about the face? TOM NISSEN: I punched her, yes. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Did you then sexually assault her? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Did you-- did you then beat her after you sexually assaulted her? TOM NISSEN: I beat her, yes. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Why did you hit her? TOM NISSEN: Because I was upset. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Oh, I see. You had just sexually assaulted her. Raped her. And you were upset. So you-- then you kneed her in the stomach and threw her to the ground. TOM NISSEN: Yes. -You know, they're like-- they were the lower echelon in prison. When they get out, they got a grudge against everybody. And when they get a chance to strike out at somebody, to even up the odds, you know? I mean, it's-- it's-- you can see it right with John. He was, I mean, you know, pushed around. Picked on. You know, I mean, sexually assaulted, you know. I mean, when-- it-- when you got out of prison and all that shit had happened to you-- I mean, any human being, you know. The first time somebody, you know, tries to intimidate you or-- or scare you or take something from you, and you're out on the streets where you get something to equal up the odds, you're not going to let it happen, you know. Unless you enjoy that, you know. I mean, and I don't know anybody that enjoys getting something took from them. And you could just see it with John, you know. He had a chance to be the bulldog. He had a chance to be the intimidator. You know, it's my turn now. -Where was the law? What was the law doing? If she identified her rapist, why didn't they go to the hospital from there? Why didn't they pick them-- it's not like nobody knew who Nissen and Lotter were. It's not like, well, where are they? We can't find them right now. Oh, they're hiding. I mean, they were there. -Because I knew that if I took the polygraph that they would know that Tom had went back there and had sex and then I went back there and tried to have sex, you know? Even though I knew that it was, as far as I knew, consensual, I knew that Keith Hays, just being the person he is-- no, no, no. He'd be like, that's all I need. And I'd go back to prison because they wouldn't give a fuck what I said. -You know, both of 'em being in prison, both of 'em realizing they were going back, and rape carries 50 years. Both on 'em being ex-felons, they were going to get some time out of that. And they figured, you know, just-- you know, if we can shut her up, you know, if we can take care of the one that's pressing charges, we ain't going back. So that-- that's exactly why they had to do that. You know, I can see that. -Well, they were just alleged charges. So I wasn't real worried. They-- they were just alleged charges. No charges were filed or nothing like that. -When I woke up that next morning, my-- Lester looked at me and said my boyfriend was a faggot. And I asked him how he could've been a faggot. Because Brandon was actually a she, and Tom, you know-- and Tom raped a girl. Wasn't a boy. And Lester looked and me and says Tom's a faggot and he just ought to come out and tell me that. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: After this sexual assault, didn't you get some, uh, some teasing, Mr. Nissen? Didn't some people, uh-- didn't Melissa Wisdom tell you people were calling you a pervert? Do you remember that? TOM NISSEN: No. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Well, you'd just had sex, forcible sex, with a woman who was dressing as a man. How did you feel about that? TOM NISSEN: I didn't feel very good about it at all. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: You got angry about that. TOM NISSEN: Angry about what? ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Angry about Teena Brandon. You're the one that was interested in finding out whether Teena Brandon was a man or a woman. TOM NISSEN: Along with a lot of other people. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: But you're the only one that pulled her pants down. TOM NISSEN: As far as I know, yes. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: And as far as you know, you're the only one that raped Teena Brandon on that night? TOM NISSEN: Yes. -Well, you know, I've pondered that for quite a while since all this has happened. And you know, you have a-- you have a girl. You have a person that first says she's a boy, then turns out to be a girl, uh, who has-- has, uh, you know, done some forgeries of their friends' checkbooks and stuff. And they've been in trouble with the law before. And then all of a sudden comes up and says, this guy and this guy raped me. Well, if we did that in society, we'd have half-- we'd have a lot of men locked up. SHERIFF LAUX: Why do you run around with girls instead of, uh, guys, being you're a girl yourself? BRANDON: Why do I what? SHERIFF LAUX: Why do you run around with girls instead of guys, being as you're a girl yourself? Why do you make girls think you're a guy? BRANDON: I haven't the slightest idea. SHERIFF LAUX: You haven't the slightest idea? You go around kissing other girls? BRANDON: The ones that I know that know about me. SHERIFF LAUX: The ones-- the girls that don't know about you thinks you're a guy. Do you kiss them? BRANDON: What does this have to do with what happened last night? SHERIFF LAUX: Because I'm trying to get some answers so I know exactly what's going on. Now, do you want to answer that question for me or not? BRANDON: I don't see why I have to. SHERIFF LAUX: Huh? BRANDON: I don't see why I have to. SHERIFF LAUX: The only thing is if it goes to court, that answer-- that question's going to come up in court. And I'm gonna want an answer for it before it goes to court. See what I'm saying? BRANDON: Because I have a sexual identity crisis. SHERIFF LAUX: You what? BRANDON: I have a sexual identity crisis. SHERIFF LAUX: You wanna explain that? BRANDON: I don't know if I can even talk about it. -That day that I took-- after the rape, I took Lana and-- and, uh, Brandon up to the Sheriff's office. And they wanted to talk to me first. And they called me back there. And, of course, I was saying, he, and I said, I mean, she. And Laux says, oh, just call it "it." -Sheriff Laux was like, this is my job and I'll do and I don't need your help. And I'm like, well, evidently you do, because these two guys have not been arrested and she's given you their names. And here she's scared to death, you know? And I told him that they had threatened her. And he hung up on me. [music playing] -It's my understanding that they were having, uh, some difficulty in regard to corroboration of her story and also regard to actual cooperation, uh, from her and also some of the other potential witnesses. -Teena Brandon was a liar. Now, I mean, you can't believe a liar. I mean, you'd have to check it out first before it ever took place and that. And, like, when she was raped and all this kind of crap, Lisa had to take her to the hospital and all this and force her to do this to prove that she was raped. And I think the law had-- I mean, they can't jump in and go because, well, nowadays you can sue on a nickel. And then, so, I think they handled it fairly well, now, myself. I mean, you know, for what they had to work with. Now, if they was work-- working with somebody that was honest, and that-- and done the same thing, then I'd of thought it was a rotten deal. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: So throughout the time that you had the occasion to interview Teena Brandon, was she consistent in her story to you? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: Yes, sir. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Did you ever note any signs of deception in the story that she was relating to you? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: I never, no. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: And did you believe her? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: Yes. -Well, she seemed so different after the rape. I mean, it was almost like she was-- they'd already killed everything that was, you know, happy. And she was just really different. There was just something different in her voice and stuff. And it's got to be really traumatic to go through. I can't even imagine. And she had made the statement that-- and she was-- not give you the sat-- she didn't even cry when she told her sister while this was going on because she wouldn't give them the satisfaction. -She was more intimidated by everybody. She-- I don't know. She was kind of scared. Real quiet. Brandon was never quiet. Um, kept a lot to herself. Did a lot of cleaning. -I don't think anybody really cared about her. They just wanted her out. Away. I particularly didn't care what happened to her at that point. I was pretty mad at her myself. I didn't want her to be beat. If I'd been there, I would have stopped that. But I wanted her to go back to Lincoln. I wanted her away. [driving sounds] [gunshot] [gunshot] [gunshot] ANNA MAE LAMBERT: And I knocked again. And when I knocked the second time, I said, I could hear Tanner. I could hear the baby crying then, in the background. And I thought, well, that's strange, that she's not getting up to take care of the baby. I knocked two or three times. And then I decided, I'm just going on in. And soon-- of course, as soon as I stepped into the living room, then I-- well, and at first, I think denied there was anything wrong. I just seen this negro sitting on the floor with the coffee table over his lap-- lap. And I thought, this is strange. But yet, you know-- and I knew then there was something wrong, but yet I was just telling myself, you know, there wasn't. And I just walked right on through the house. The baby was just screaming. And so I just walked right on in there and walked straight to his crib-- didn't look at anything else-- and picked him up. And when I turned to leave, then I looked over to the bed. Course, I could tell when I went in, then, there was something wrong in there. Because I just looked across the bed and seen Lisa on the far side next to the window, and I knew-- I could tell by looking there was nothing I could do to help her anymore. That I needed to help Tanner and to get help there. To get law people there. REPORTER: Sheriff deputies were called to the house around 9 o'clock Friday morning, where they found the bodies of 21-year-old Teena Brandon of Lincoln, 22-year-old Philip Devine of Iowa, and 23-year-old Lisa Lambert of Humboldt. While two of the shooting victims were from out of town, friends of Humboldt victim Lisa Lambert say the news of her death was especially hard to take. -She never did anything to anybody. She never had enemies. It's a total shock. And nothing ever like that happens here in Humboldt. REPORTER: Police report Lisa's nine-month-old son, who was found in the home, was the only one to escape injury. But it will probably take a long time for this quiet town in southeast Nebraska to heal its wounds following a New Year's tragedy, which could leave a lasting scar on this close-knit community. DEPUTY SHERIFF JON LARSON: I walked in and seen one male individual, uh, partially of the couch, partially on the floor. walked to a bedroom, seen two female individuals, uh, in a bed. All three were deceased. In my opinion, all three were executed. And, uh, it's one of those things where the only thing, I think, that kept the child from being killed was its age, because it couldn't say, you did it. You did it. And I think that's the only thing that, uh, kept the child alive. And the fact that they ran out of ammo. -I pulled up into the driveway there and they said, just go on. Larson got out and come around my side of the door and he says, leave. I says, I am not leaving. I says, what the hell is going on? He says, there's been a triple homicide down there. He says, and I didn't know how to tell you. I says, you've got to tell me straight out. I says, where's Tanner? He's all right. But he says, your daughter's gone. He says, now, will you please leave. I says, OK. So then I-- I just backed out and I took off back home then. -I do know that when I touched her head-- because I couldn't-- you know, I just wanted to hold her so much-- that I couldn't touch her head anywhere that there wasn't bumps on it. So I-- I-- her-- I mean, there wasn't a space on her head that didn't have a bump on top of her head or anything. That I did look and I could see that. And she still had bruises that you could see. -I said, leave me alone. I want to go to the bar. So I drove back and went to the bar. And we sat there and we drank-- I drank three or four beers then. And I said, now I'm going to go to the Steener. And the police met his garage there. I says, that clutch just ain't working just right yet. I said, I want to see what I screwed up on her and that. Because I didn't know that much about a hydraulic clutch. And so then I pulled over there. I said, I'll be home. I says, give me two hours. I'll be home. -But I am grateful for as much as I've known Tenna and loved Tenna that it was over quickly. What hurts me is the rape. And the non-action. And at Christmas time. I mean, when the whole world is talking about peace, love, fellowship. -This is when we get the news. -Yeah. You have the murder. You have the rape. She had to be raped on Christmas Eve and murdered New Year's Eve. REPORTER: This afternoon, authorities revealed that John Lotter and Marvin Nissen of Falls City are being held in connection with the three deaths. The two men were already in custody yesterday afternoon on an arrest warrant for the kidnapping and sexual assault of shooting victim Teena Brandon back on Christmas day. A Falls City woman who dated Teena Brandon under the assumption that she was a he told 1011 news why she believes the two suspects assaulted Teena. -They said that the only reason why they depantsed him is because of me, because they seen I was going down because of all of it and that they did it to show me that it was a female and for me to just turn around and walk away. REPORTER: Lana says she knows both of the men charged in the assault. Her sister Leslie lost her boyfriend, Phillip Devine, in the tragic shooting also. Devine, pictured here in the middle, was in town for the week visiting Leslie's family and had gone over to the farmhouse following an argument between the two, placing him in the wrong place at the wrong time. MICHELLE LOTTER: Sometime during that day, I had heard that John was arrested for the murders. So I went up to the courthouse to find out what was going on and found a cop and he said that he was arrested for rape, not murder. How did I hear anybody was murdered? -By nightfall, we already knew that, uh, John had stolen a gun. And we'd also recovered that gun. But we'd already made the arrest by that time. But we'd arrested them for the sexual assaults at that time. And, uh, of course, then he went ahead and-- Nissen went ahead and said, yes, well, he was out there and killed those three people. Well, that kind of gives you an indication, but, uh, but as far as a warrant, no. You don't need one. They did good. DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: So I believed I had probable cause to arrest him for the sexual assault. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: And when-- when did you make that determination, officer? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: I made the determination after probably interviewing Mr. Nissen and Mr. Lotter. But-- ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: That was on December 28? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: Yeah. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: And at that time, on December 28, you remember the Falls-- or the Richardson County Sheriff's Office, right? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: Yes, it was. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: And on that date, you were empowered to arrest for felony offenses within the confines of Richards-- Richardson County? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: Yes, I was. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: And did you place either individual under arrest on that date? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: I was advised not to. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: And who advised you not to do that? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: Mr. Laux advised that we should prepare the reports as normal protocol and send them to the county attorney. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Based on the fact that you did not make arrests, he was the man in charge? The one responsible for making that decision? DEPUTY SHERIFF TOM OLBERDING: He's my boss. I've gotta do what he says. Yes. -But the county attorney says that officials continued to move forward with their investigation into the alleged rape and kidnapping of Teena Brandon despite inconsistencies in her story. -The people responsible for these homicides is not the sheriff's department or the police department. It's the defendants that are in court today. REPORTER: If convicted on three counts of first degree murder. Both John Lotter and Tom Nissen could face the death penalty. Friends of shooting victim Teena Brandon, pictured here on the left, say the woman's portrayal of yourself as a man may have played a role in the murders. The sister of accused murderer John Lotter says her brother became angry when he learned that Teena was really a female. -I don't think they went down there to do it. They went to scare him. And something happened. [music playing] REPORTER: Prosecutors wasted little time at the Richardson County courthouse in Falls City. They were brief and to the point. They told the jury that Nissen and John Lotter planned and carried out the murders so that Teena Brandon could not testify that they had raped her. Now, the defense attorney for Nissen contends that it could have been Lotter, and not Nissen, that was the trigger man. And he told the jury that Nissen should be considered innocent until otherwise proven. -Well, I believe had I not met Brandon or Lotter, I would haven't been in no mess at all. INTERVIEWER: Say that you'd met Brandon and not Lotter? -They're gutless. They're cowardly people to begin with. You know, they prey on people. You know, they go up. They use weapons against unarmed people. They shoot a woman sitting on a bed. Uh, you know, her only difference is a blanket. They shoot another woman in the face while she's holding a baby. They shoot a man sitting down. I mean, those are acts of cowards. Those are gutless cowards. And, uh, you know, so I don't think there's anything, you know-- you know, they're nothing. They're just-- they're just punks. -Uh, Tom was quiet. And, uh, and I've never seen Tom rowdy or anything. Tom seemed like a-- a nice kid. I knew he was having problems. He was married. And then he was also seeing my sister, Melissa. And I knew he was having problems with the wife. But Tom just seemed to be OK, you know? He didn't seem to be a pushy guy. He just-- he was just another polite one. -Some people get mad and go punch holes through walls. I get mad and I might burn myself with a cigarette or something minor like that, that just kind of snaps me back in reality and, you know, makes me realize that, uh, hey, you need to get control of this then, because you don't want to lash out at somebody else because of what's going on inside of you. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Mr. Nissen, did you ever say it was more than just getting rid-- you know, rid of a couple of dikes? Or, you know, just getting rid of a couple of lesbians and some goddamn nigger? Did you ever say that? Never referred to Lisa Lambert and Teena Brandon as dikes or lesbians? TOM NISSEN: I believe at one time I referred to Teena Brandon as a lesbian, yes. MICHAEL J. HALL: Nissen told me he did it. He says how he did it. He said he pulled the trigger. He stabbed her. He said, uh, he killed both the girls. And he said Lotter killed DeVine. And he said if it was him, at that moment, if he was thinking right, he said if two people walked in, he said by rights, only one person should've walked out. That's the way he thought. That's the way he said it should have been. He said if he had a chance to do it all over again, he would do it. He said this time, he wouldn't get caught. TOM NISSEN: I took a step over, which would have put me directly in front of Brandon. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Why did you do that? TOM NISSEN: At that point I asked John Lotter for the knife or if he still had the knife. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: How did he respond to you? TOM NISSEN: He handed me the knife. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Why did you want the knife? TOM NISSEN: To stab Teena Brandon. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Why were you looking to stab her at that time? TOM NISSEN: To make sure she was dead. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Did you have some impression that she wasn't yet dead. TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: What was that? TOM NISSEN: She was twitching. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Can you tell me what you did to ensure that she was dead? TOM NISSEN: I took the knife out of John Lotter's hand and opened it. I reached down with my left hand and grabbed Teena Brandon's right shoulder. And I pulled her towards me at the same time I was pushing the knife towards her. And I stabbed her. -I think-- I think there's people in this world, and I don't want to say especially here in the Midwest, but certainly where I'm from, I've seen it time and time again. They don't view people-- they don't view homosexuals, they don't view people that are different from them-- they don't view them as being equal. You know, they think it's OK. Well, yeah, I can shoot her, you know. She's-- she's a lesbian. She's a cross-dresser. She's a dyke. She's-- she's less than human. And they, uh, they rationalize their actions by that. I've seen it before. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Look at what they did to these people. Teena Brandon-- the gun to Teena Brandon's chin was so close that the powder burned. The unspent powder burned. Then, of course, she was stabbed. Look at the manner. These are executions. These are assassinations. And they tell you a lot about the intent of the people when they walked in that door. These aren't wild shots that happened to hit someone or-- or spraying bullets around the place. These were calculated executions. And this Lisa Lambert fared no better. Uh, Lisa Lambert also [inaudible]. And Lisa Lambert's life-- we'll see in the item here in exhibit 105, close enough to her eye that the powder also burned her eye. That was the last thing Lisa Lambert saw before she died. Executions. That's the only way to describe these killings. And then Phillip DeVine. Consider Phillip DeVine. If you can imagine the terror of Philip DeVine sitting in at room, this young amputee, sitting in that other room listening to two people die and knowing-- he had to know-- he was-- he was next. He knew it. And this defendant goes to that other room, herds Phillip DeVine into the living room, and then he, too, gets a bullet to the head. And we'll have as well as one to the face [inaudible]. -Well, it should be short and sweet. There's, like-- talked to one guy and he says, they should get a hold of Old Sparky right off the bat. Because no matter what in the world-- I mean, it won't bring none of 'em back or anything like that. But what-- why put up with not it? Like, I talked to one guy. He says, Donny's the one who's on the farm. He says, he had a not-- he had a pig that was not it. He knocked it in the head. Because all it's going to do is cost you money. He says, and they're animals and that. He done that. He says, why in the hell don't-- why don't they just have that done? Because, he says, beyond a shadow of a doubt, they're guilty as hell. He says, so why do they need all these appeals? I says, that's the law. [music playing] -I'm James J. And I'm from Minneapolis. And the reason I'm here is because I happen to be transgendered also. And crimes of violence against anyone is wrong. It's not just transgendered or transsexual individuals. And I'm here to protest the fact that someone who wasn't doing any harm to anyone has been so badly treated by being raped and murdered. -I'm glad that they're showing some support for Teena. You know, she needed that. I don't think she thought that she had it from too many people. REPORTER: But not everyone in Falls City is in favor of the demonstration. -I think it's a bunch of shit. REPORTER: Why? -Because if God would've wanted gays he wouldn't have put women on the earth. -Everyone who fucks with gender has some kind of brush with this kind of violence, this kind of, um-- like, everyone's got their war stories. I've been you know, held at knife point twice. I've been raped once. And um, and so I moved to San Francisco and then Seattle. And-- and that's a lot easier. And you forget about this stuff. -You know, I'm verbal. I've always-- I'm a verbal-- more of a verbal person, you know? I'll tell somebody, hey, fuck-- you know. And even say, sometimes, I'll kill you. I mean, I don't know. In my lifetime, I've probably said I'll kill you probably a million times. But did I carry it out? No. You know, and that's the whole thing, you know. There's knowing that it's, you know, what you're saying is one thing. But doing the other thing-- and I know the difference between both, you know. And I'm not-- just because I say something I ain't gonna carry it out. If I did, there'd be a lot of people-- there'd be a lot of people dead. That's, uh, you know. And believe me, there's been people that's done, you know, a lot more to me than-- than Teena Brandon would ever have done. So it's just ridiculous. -Uh, around Falls City, John was noted as a trouble maker. You know, always getting in trouble and taking cars. So-- so most of the people with hiring wouldn't do nothing with him, you know. And, uh, there was a few that, you know, would try to give him a job or something. But they didn't have the big money to help, you know, to keep him going. So, you know, he couldn't have done well around here. If he'd went somewhere else, maybe. But, uh, staying here, you know, the stigma was already there, you know. John's a trouble maker. -In my reviewing the docket documents for the-- this court hearing, he always went back to Falls City. He stole cars in Buffalo County in the western part of Nebraska to get back to Falls City. He had a one track mind, and it was to be in Falls City. When he got out of prison, he went to Falls City and the night before the court hearing, we were able to interview John. And I said to him, John, why did you keep coming back to Falls City? If-- he had told us how the people weren't very nice to him and he couldn't get jobs. And he said, I wanted to be with my mom. This is at 24. He's still saying this. -I just, uh, I told him that if he had done anything that he could tell me the truth. I thought, I'd like to know the truth because, uh, that-- you know, I didn't want to have to find it out from someone else or-- and I said-- told him that no matter what he'd done, that I would still love him and that I would still come to see him and stick behind him. But I wished that he would tell me the truth. And he said that-- he told me, he said that he hadn't done anything. Well, like I-- I've said, I'm not sure whether he's blocked it out, if he did do it, or whether he didn't do anything. But he doesn't come up with anything to show any place else he's been. That's what's-- that's the worst part. -I mean, I hate the idea of-- of copping deals. I hate it. I hate it with a passion. But I also know that in order to get the bigger fish, you sometimes have to do it, as distasteful as it may be. And the only way we were going to get Nissen to squeal like the pig he is is to offer him a deal and spare his tail from the chair. And Nissen was a coward. We knew that. That's how we played it. We played him for the gutless coward that he is. And he sang like a canary. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: In terms of killing people, you're telling us you didn't kill anybody? TOM NISSEN: Correct. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Just like you didn't sexually assault Teena Brandon? TOM NISSEN: That was a lie. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: That was a lie. This is the truth? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: How are we to tell the difference, Mr. Nissen? TOM NISSEN: I guess you're talking about yourself. ATTORNEY MIKE FABIAN: Oh, it's up to us? Any suggestions? TOM NISSEN: No. KATE BORNSTEIN: Being in the corporation and the reality of hate crime comes back, you know, and especially today when, um, Nissen took the stand, you know, and he started describing, in this awful monotone and this awful, like, dead voice, um, yeah, well, we-- you know, we planned to kill her. And who's we? Me and John Lotter. And then he, you know, I-- he said this thing, you know, like they said, well, what other ways would you try to kill her, when you thought to kill her? And he said, well, we came up with this one idea of chopping off her hands and her head. And then he described the axe that he got. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: What took place at that point? TOM NISSEN: I moved away from the bed a little bit. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: And? TOM NISSEN: And John Lotter raised his arm with the pistol in his hand and shot Lisa Lambert. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Did you see on which part of her anatomy she was shot? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Where? TOM NISSEN: In the stomach area. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: And what was her reaction as she was shot? TOM NISSEN: She jumped and screamed. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: She was screaming again? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Where-- where was the baby? TOM NISSEN: Sitting right next to her. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Can you describe what happened next, please? TOM NISSEN: I saw John Lotter raise his hand with the pistol in his hand. And the pistol fired and Lisa Lambert was hit. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Did you see where? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Where was that? TOM NISSEN: In her eye. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: What happened? What did you do? TOM NISSEN: Her head jerked back, and she went limp. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: What was done to Phillip at that point? TOM NISSEN: I told Phillip to sit down. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Did he sit? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Where? TOM NISSEN: On the couch. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: And what happened at that time? TOM NISSEN: Then I moved back towards John Lotter. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: What'd you observe? TOM NISSEN: John Lotter raised the pistol. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Did the pistol fire? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Are you aware of whether it hit anything or anyone? TOM NISSEN: It looked like it hit Phil. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Why do you say it looked like it him him? What did you notice? TOM NISSEN: He slumped back into the couch. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Was there a second shot fired at that time? TOM NISSEN: Yes. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: By who? TOM NISSEN: By John Lotter. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: And where did it strike, if you know? TOM NISSEN: It appeared to hit Phil. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Do you know where? TOM NISSEN: No. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: And what was the reaction of Phil at that point? TOM NISSEN: Phil slid down a couch a little bit. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: Where did he come to rest? TOM NISSEN: He was still leaning against the couch. -I don't-- I just can't see him there with a little baby and the baby's mother and, you know, telling Tom to get the baby away and then shooting the baby's mother. I just-- I don't see it like-- I-- I don't understand that. And I can't see him doing that. -We got the right two people. And I'd say it's real close. I'd say what probably needs to testified to in court would be about as close as you're going to get to what happened. Because the investigators and-- there was things that he said that only the person or persons who were there would know. And, uh, so there's no doubt in my mind, the right two people are in jail for the murders. ATTORNEY JIM ELWORTH: John Lotter can only be described with one word. That words is evil. Evil to put a bullet in someone's head because she had the audacity to tell on him. To talk about-- to make a record. How dare she make a record. So he puts a bullet in her head. And it's evil that shot Lisa Lambert and evil that shot Phillip DeVine as he begged for his life. That's what we're dealing with here. You can bet we're dealing with evil. But the evil is on trial. Nissen's trial is done. Nissen's not on trial. This is evil, and this is guilty of several charges. -What did we end up with? Five people's lives completely ruined. Three of 'em's dead. Two of 'em's in the penitentiary. And sad mothers. And I remember the day when the sentences come down. And I commented that this is a day that mothers cry. And they were. All the mothers were crying. And what you do? There's nothing you can do. How do you teach people not to kill each other? I don't know. REPORTER: Lotter, do you have anything to say to Lisa's family? -Same thing I've been saying all the time. I'm innocent. I'll prove it. REPORTER: What do you think of Marvin Nissen? -He's a little fucking liar. -If he-- if he did do it, then I definitely wouldn't want him on the streets again. Um, I-- and unless they can prove that he didn't, I suppose I would want him to never have parole. And, uh, as far as the death penalty, well, if that's what he gets, then that's-- we'll just have to live with it. -Elated, tired, excited that it's over and the verdict came back the way it did. I feel sorry for his mother and all that he's put her through and for the family. I'm just tired and glad it's over. My daughter got justice. REPORTER: Is this closure for you? Yes and no. It's not ever going to be total closure. This is something I'm never going to really-- the pain's not going to go anywhere. She was my baby. And somebody cut her life short just because he didn't like her believing that she was doing anything else. That's not right. REPORTER: Do you believe he should get the death penalty? -Oh, yes. Very much so. That's what I want. I would never be satisfied with him just in prison. I want him dead. -I don't know. I-- I personally don't want to see him get death row because I don't want him to die. I just can't accept the fact to have my 24-year-old brother die. I'm going to start crying. JUDGE: It is the judgment of this court that the defendant, John L. Lotter, is hereby sentenced to the penalty of death for the murder and the first degree murder of Teena Brandon, that the defendant, John L. Lotter, is hereby sentenced to the penalty of death for the murder in the first degree of Lisa Lambert, and that the defendant, John L. Lotter, is hereby sentenced to the penalty of death for the murder in the first degree of Phillip DeVine. REPORTER: Were the actions what happened today? -Well, I-- I think he got what he deserved. I mean, at least he had a fair trial and a decision. He never gave them a fair trial. He was judge and jury and killed them. So I think he got what he deserved. I think he's evil. -I don't think justice is served, uh, by putting one person on the death row and letting another one live. Even-- even though it's without parole, I think we as a culture haven't come to terms with our own responsibility for helping kids like this, having seen how John was as a child and-- CLARENCE ROBINSON: What's what's in that, uh, talking the judges were doing? MARY ANN GREENE: Right. -They-- you know, the psychiatrist, the psychologist, said that John is operating at about a 9 or 10 year old. Do you electrocute 9 and 10 year olds in this state now? -I think the justice system has taken way too long for what it's supposed to be. Because the criminal is protected more than what me and you are. If you ain't a hardened criminal, you're-- you're nobody. That's the way it seems. I know it ain't right to think that way, but that's the way I feel. REPORTER: Is this one step closer to, um, helping you and your family? -Yes. It'll never be the same. -You know, you think-- if you think back to the little house south of Humboldt and the three people died in there some night, think of the fear and what's going on that night to those three people. When you're watching your friend getting killed, you know, and know your next. What's that like? And you got a baby right there, and you're afraid the baby's gonna die. What kind of fear is that? You know. But yet way down the road somewhere, there's always a chance they can get off on some judge's decision that we did something wrong. But, uh, in my opinion, we did nothing wrong.
