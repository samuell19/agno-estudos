[opening music theme] [gunshot] [car honking] Hey Al. ALEX: You didn't have to come up the hill for me. It's on my way. When do you think you're going to buy yourself a car? ALEX: I can't afford it. [inaudible] Man, you make more than I do. No wife, no kids. I'll let you buy this morning. [theme music] [player piano music] [knocking] [crowd noises] [school bell ringing] [clucking] SMEDKE: Hold it, hold it, hold it. [inaudible] Come give me a hand. [inaudible] All right. [inaudible]. Ah. [inaudible] FINN: Tie it down. Tie it down. SMEDKE: Come on. Come on, stop laughing. It's a heavy one. All right. Ugh. Bring meat hook. We go get beef. DOCTOR: Hey, kid, those papers for sale? Hey, kid, I want to buy a paper. SMEDKE: All right. Get up there. Give me the hook, kid. All right. Come on. Will you get the rest of that duck? Come on, come on, come on. Good boy. [humming] [inaudible]. OK. Ah, good boy. You big help. FINN: Surprised you then, didn't I? SMEDKE: Close the door. [knocking] This morning, I said to myself, Jack, you're going to cut some hair today. Saturday, I read the paper all day in this shop, wondering why the kids don't come and get their hair cut no more. And when I got home, I had to read the paper all over again just to keep from having to talk to the old lady. I don't mind long hair. Ain't got nothing against it. People keep telling me, Jack, pretty soon you're going to be out of business. Styles is getting longer. The shop's paid for, I tell them. Only I don't like not being busy. SMEDKE: What the hell is so funny? [laughing] Di-- Dick-- Dick Tracy. I thought he really, really, really had him this time. I thought [inaudible] was safe on him. Thought that was Friday. [inaudible], huh? What they don't think of. Ah. Wait a minute. Where do you find this paper? It was lay-- lay-- laying right here by-- by his feet. This is today's paper. Move. You idiot! You left the door open. I-- I didn't come in the front door. You-- you did. I don't care! I just don't care. BARBER: Long hair's gotta be shaped and cared for just like short hair, maybe more. A man's hair is part of his personality. Sloppy head, sloppy mind, that's what I say. And like I told you, long hair's harder to handle. And I can see you ain't been combing it out like you should. Now this will make it easier for you to handle. [singing in non-english speech] BARBER: You women are all alike. [bell on door] Hey, I'm sorry, kid. What's the matter with that kid, Jack? I thought she heard the bell. BARBER: Ah, she couldn't hear it, Tom. The poor kid's deaf. [inaudible]. TOM: That's tough. BOSS: Alex? There's somebody here who'd like to talk to you. Alex, this is Miss Ford. Sandy. I'm with Community Medical Information Center and-- She's, uh-- Gert sent her. ALEX: Yeah? Um, well, I'm sorry to bother you. But-- ALEX: Sorry, I-- You're setting up an office down on Main Street. And I'm trying to give people an idea of what we're doing. ALEX: Yeah? Sort of a grassroots attempt to advise people who-- who may need medical aid about the various services available to them. ALEX: Hm mm. Uh, well, there are a lot of people who don't feel they can afford it. So they hesitate to seek medical aid. And, and, uh-- BOSS: Yeah, I, uh, got a [inaudible] on 26th near the old-- ALEX: What's that got to do with me? SANDY: Ah, well, the-- the girl down at the enchilada stand said that, uh, we might be able to help your daughter. She had no business telling you that. SANDY: Well, she didn't mean to. Look, I know there may be a lot of people who do need your help. But go work with some blacks or chicanos. Don't bother with me. I don't need it. SANDY: Well, why don't I just leave you a card? There are a lot of medical advances-- Look, I don't need your help. I don't want your help. Why don't you just take your card and go on about your business. I got to get back to work. I didn't even know he had a kid. Ah. Ah, shit. [trumpet playing] GERT: Mind your own business. Mind your own business. Mind your own-- Watch out, Al, it's hot. I was only trying to be helpful. I mean, big mystery. You don't ever come to my house. So I figure maybe you've got a wife. Now finally, Mr. Closed Mouth tells me he's got a daughter. I love kids. So she's got a handicap. That's-- that's nothing to be ashamed of. Listen, lots of kids got problems. What's the matter? AL: I dropped something on my foot at the shop. FINN: I-- I-- I saw her down at the bar-- barbershop getting a haircut. No, you didn't. She's right there. FINN: Wh-- where? Right there. You-- you-- you want me to bring her in? Why? Does she look scared? FINN: No. SMEDKE: Anyway, she can't talk. So don't worry about it. Ah, OK. Sh-- she was right down at the bar-- barbershop. All right. All right. Forget it. What's the harm in letting the doctor take a look at the kid? He might be able to help her. No, I don't want those people poking around and making her feel sorry for herself. Well, maybe there's some special kind of school she could go to. Well, who does she have to play with? Come on, Gert, you know how kids are. They'd just tease her and remind her how different she is. Look, you-- you can't go on protecting her from other people the rest of her life. I can try. Look, maybe if I went down-- Drop it, Gert. OK? Drop it. I'll be right there. All right. Am I going to see you tonight? I don't know. Call me? Yeah. Take care of your foot now. You might have broken a toe or something. I will. MR. TREMAINE: [SINGING] Oh, how would you like to tuttle, tuttle along wi' me? We'll take the route of the old house down by the dee. We'll sing away all our troubles and laugh [inaudible]. And I'll give you a tutty, a teeny wee tutty if you'll tuttle along with me. SANDY: Doc. Do you realize some people just don't want to admit that they can't do everything for themselves? You would think I'm selling brushes or something. So-- Sandy, I want you to find some people Mr. Tremaine's age. And check with the local minister and see if he can suggest a place where they can meet at least once a week. Hm mm. Play bingo, checkers, things like that. And also go downtown and see if the manager of that bowling alley will let them bowl a couple free games a week. You know pretty much what to do. OK, boss. Bye. Is-- is this a holiday or something? DOCTOR: Not to my knowledge, why? Oh, I saw a little girl down by the newsstand. I was wondering why she wasn't in school. Oh. [sounds of urinating] [flushing] What do you want? [inaudible]. Ah, very good, very good, very good. [inaudible] Well, let me see here. Eh, yes, nice, very nice. [mouthing words] [humming] M-- Mr. Smedke. SMEDKE: Just a minute. I want to check something again. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. Here. All right. [humming] SMEDKE: Ah! Ah. Man is nothing without trade. Money is nothing unless you have trade, unless you have pride in your trade. You're a high school dropout. You should know your limitation. When you learn trade, you can have money. All right. You understand what I'm saying, Finn? Hmm? You know what I'm talking about? How are you doing, kid? What the hell is that? What the hell you call that? What are you dumbhead? If you're going to practice on meat, use your own meat. This is hamburger now, look, hamburger. No good. Ah. Beef, beef. I-- I-- You use beef if you want to make hamburger. Not lamb. Oh. You want-- you want to be butcher? You want to be butcher? Keep your hands off the meat. You start with chicken, chicken, you know chicken, damn chicken? All right, come on. I take you in the back. We get some god damn chicken. Let's go. [clucking] Come on, Finn. How long does it take you to get one chicken? Come on. [mumbling] All right. I want you-- I want you to watch very, very carefully. I want you to do this job from now on, OK? You bring chicken over here. You size him up, all right? So then you bring it up and chop chop. No head. You bring body over here. You get rid of blood. No, not high. You get blood all on the floor. All right. Try it. I-- I-- I-- SMEDKE: I what? Try it. Come on. But I-- [inaudible]. SMEDKE: You want me to do it? Yeah. SMEDKE: All right. Give me chicken, put it down, line it up. You know where you want to cut, right? And chop. Hey, how's the foot? Oh, it'll be all right. I'm going to go home and soak it. Take tomorrow morning off, why don't you? And it wouldn't hurt to see a doctor. You never know. You're liable to have broke something. Nah, it'll be all right. I've got workman's comp. Why don't you use it? Nah, it's not worth it. You're paying for it. Buy you a beer. No, thanks. Al's going to pick me up. Say, the wife and I are taking the kids to the zoo on Sunday. Maybe you and your daughter would like to come along. It might be fun for her. You can take Gert along, too. How about it? Gert put you up to this? Gert? No, no, I just thought it might be fun if you-- Fun? Look, it's not fun to know you're not like everyone else, you know? It's not fun to see kids laughing at something you can't hear. [car horn] Her mother died when she was born. I raised her to take care of herself. She's happy the way things are because she doesn't know nothing different. I know what's best for her, OK? BOSS: Sure. [car horn] Thanks, anyway. See you tomorrow. [car door slam] [buzzer] SMEDKE: Now, turn [inaudible]. Turn it. Well, come with me, will you? FINN: Yes. Ow. Come on. FINN: OK, OK. OK. -All right. You all right? FINN: Yeah. SMEDKE: Over here. Ah, all right, very good. Now listen, what I want you to do is to kill these chickens, all right? Kill them, then clean them, and dress them. We will have nice display for tomorrow, all right? All, all, all of them? Of course, all of them. Why do you think I bought them? All right, tomorrow, OK? You're a good boy. First thing in morning. All-- all of them. Goodnight, Mr. Smedke. Have a nice time. DOCTOR: We don't even know if she needs our help. You can't go around forcing yourself on people. He's got to come to us. People are funny, Sandy. We move in here and start forcing our help on people, we might as well turn around and move out. We can't be looked upon as do good meddlers or intruders. And no one knows better than I do what it's like to be in a position to help and-- and not be wanted. Come on, let's do this. I've retired. Show the local folks that we're human like everybody else. No, I'm just going to stay home and watch the fight on TV. Yeah. Yeah, it is. Starts at 8 o'clock. Did, too. It's got it in the paper. Here, it's 8 o'clock. [inaudible] Yeah, you're right. Well, I don't know. Look, I tell you what. I-- I guess I could use a drink. Why don't I just meet you down at Ray's bar in about half an hour? No, don't bother. I'll meet you there. OK. Bye-bye. SANDY: Know something, Doc? DOCTOR: What's that? SANDY: I've never been to a bar before. DOCTOR: You're kidding. SANDY: No, no, never. DOCTOR: Well, I wouldn't worry about it too much. I was practically raised in one. My father was a bartender. Everybody called him Doc. You know, set 'em up, Doc. Let me tell you about my pains, Doc. And for 35 cents, he'd pour them a glass of draft beer and dump in a shot of slow gin and listen to their problems. SANDY: Slow gin? DOCTOR: Yeah, don't knock it. Used to solve a lot of their problems just by listening to them. SANDY: Just by listening? DOCTOR: Well, the closest thing to medical advice I ever heard him say was sit up straight. SANDY: He'd say that to the customers? DOCTOR: No, he-- no, he'd say that to me at least twice a day. [laughing] [train horn] What are you having? Uh, beer? Yeah, of course. Couple beers. Pat, Pat, two beers over here. One here and one here. That Pat, uh, I keep telling him he's not going to get that damn TV working unless he brings cable in here, you know? Too much interference. Oh, yeah, yeah. You are new in neighborhood, no? Yeah, we just opened an office up the street. Yeah, I know. I know what goes on, see. I have butcher shop for 10 years in this neighborhood. DOCTOR: Oh, yeah, yeah. SMEDKE: I know you move in. What I don't see with my own eyes, usually my customers tell me about it. I know what goes on. You are a doctor, no? DOCTOR: Yeah, yeah. SMEDKE: Your partner? He's doctor, too? DOCTOR: Yeah, he's a doctor. Give us drink here. These people are thirsty. You know, my father-- my father was butcher. And his father-- his father was butcher, also. That's why I am butcher. Oh, I see. You know, let me tell you something. Butcher in old country sometimes does work of doctor. [inaudible] And butcher, there in old country get more respect than in this country. That's true. Hm, never thought of that before. Yeah. You are-- you are surgeon. No, I'm a GP with a master's in psychology. Ah. You might say that I'm a medical consultant psychologist. Medical-- Consulting psychologist. That's a mouthful. I don't know where they bring these titles from. Neither do I. That's very good. Here, Pat, take it out of here. This is on Smedke, your new neighbor. Thank you very much. Thank you. Tender or tough, meat is meat, anyway you want to cut it. Well, I guess you've got something there. -That's what Smedke said. -Oh, I see. That's my philosophy. To you. ALEX: Hey, I'm sorry I kept you waiting. Thought maybe you were standing me up. Thanks, Mrs. Price. I'll see you. I caught a ride with her. GERT: Good. [crying] You know something? You are very, very pretty young lady. You know that? SANDY: Uh, do you have any children? Children? SANDY: Yeah. SMEDKE: I have boy-- is my apprentice, you know. He's orphan boy, you know. He has no father and no mother. And, uh, he-- he, uh, not too bright. I catch him one time trying to steal my car. I bring him with me. I want to make butcher out of him. But my wife, she cannot stand the boy. She does not want him around the house. What am I going to do? I will tell you something about that boy. That boy is going to be a hell of a good butcher one of these days. Aim for the pocket through the one. Right through the center of it. Hit a ball behind it right on that same line. Hit it right where the one is now. That's in line. Very good. All right. Where-- where are you? [inaudible]. Shoot again. Doctor, goddamn it. Get your hands off me. Come on, where are you? [clucking] ALEX: You stepped on my foot dammit. Ah Jesus. Let me take a look at it. I'm a doctor. ALEX: Ah, it's all right. [chickens clucking] We have here. Well, you know that boy's really got problems. I wonder what they are. Maybe it's his dauther. Oh, is he the one? Yeah. His girlfriend seems scared he'll recognize her. Well, he probably chewed her out good and proper for telling in the first place. Well, Watson, looks like we got our first case, huh? How do you suggest we proceed, Holmes? Well, first we start with his toe. And then if we can get his confidence, maybe he'll let us run a few tests on the daughter. But that's going to be the hard part. You know what I don't like about being a psychological assistant? The low pay? No. The long hours? No. The lack of glamour? No. No, I'm serious. OK, what is it? I don't like the feeling I get sometimes everyone I meet's a little bit sick. Do you ever get that feeling? Yeah. What do you do about it? I just remind myself I'm acting like a cop, believes everybody's dishonest but him. [crying] What the hell is that? Oh god, something knocked over the garbage cans. Ow. Shit. I hit my foot. Look, look this is dumb. I mean I feel like a house school kid, sitting in front of my house parked, worrying my folks are gonna wake up. Only it's not my house. Oh come on. I didn't hurt my foot on purpose. Well, are you going to invite me in? Or are we going to sit and neck in the car? You know how I feel about the kid. Look, it's getting late. I gotta go. [gunshot] [gunshot] [fiddle music] Come on! What's the matter with you? She has bite! It's me. Maxie, I'm your friend. What are you doing? [inaudible]. Stop! What the hell? Feathers. Blood. What the hell? You better tell me what is going on in here? What is this? What is this? This is how I teach you how to kill chicken? This is what I teach you? What is this? You can't speak? What is this? You cut the head off the chicken? That's what you do? What's the matter with you? Tell me! Tell me! [inaudible]. I killed the chicken! I know you-- what the hell's the matter with your face? Tell me. Tell me what this is all about. You know? They all got-- got-- got away. One at a time, you're supposed to-- One at a time! Didn't I tell you that? You kill one at a time! I had-- they run all over the place! One at a time, I tell you! All right! All right! All right! Now you stop! You have to clean this place up! No! Come on! You idiot. Pick up your pace. SMEDKE: When are you going to start thinking, Finn? When are you going to start thinking? Are you trying to ruin business? Yesterday, you leave door open. That was you. SMEDKE: All right, shut up. Today, you attack little girl. But sh-- All right, shut up! Now make sure we have good business. I don't want people to be suspicious. Meat is meat. A man has to make a living. All right. Now, listen. I want you to clean this place up. And I mean clean it up! Then I have job for you. Never mind. Clean. O-O-OK. OK, I think that's got it. If you have any problems tomorrow, Alex, give me a call and we'll set up a little appointment for an x-ray. But I don't see any reason why you can't go back to work. Thank you very much, Doctor. I really appreciate it. Oh, I needed the practice, anyway. So, I was wondering if I could ask you something that, uh, is really none of my business. Like what? Your daughter, Maxie. What about her? Well, I think I can teach her to communicate. Ah, Doc, I don't want her waving her hands around. No, I mean I think I can teach her to talk. Wait, let me show you. Now, you watch my mouth. Tell me what I'm saying. What did I say? Apple. Right. Now tell me what I say now. Heat. Right. Now, I'm asking to do the same thing that I just showed you. Even more so. All it takes is a little time. I can have her talking in full sentences. Yeah. I don't want to get her started on something that's not going to work out. Look, why don't you invite me over to the house tonight? We'll sit down. We'll get acquainted. We'll get to know one another, and we'll see where it goes. We'll just play it by ear. I just don't want anybody to treat her like a freak. Oh that's very, very, very nice. Look like new store. All right. Stop for a moment Here is plan. The same arrangement. You park truck. You leave door open. Then you go get Coca-Cola if you want one. They have ginger ale. Ginger ale, all right. Then you come back. Come right back. But you drive careful. I always drive-- drive carefully. I tell you, drive careful. Listen to me. But don't do anything that will make them stop you. All right? I already-- Listen to me. This is important. All right. I already told the people who wrap the meat that we dispose of to wrap it more careful. All right? OK. You take that. OK. Can-- can-- can I get a Snickers, too? How much is that? 25-- No, no, no, no. When you come back, I bring you Snicker. All right? Very, very nice. GERT: How is it? [singing] Ow! All right. [chickens clucking] What the hell are you doing? Come on. All right. All right, now come down here. Wait! Underneath. Wait a minute. Wait a minute. Underneath! Oh! Oh, hi, Al! Hey, you want a lift home? No, thanks. I got some shopping to do. [singing] Me-- me-- merry Christmas, Mr. Smedke. What, do you think you're Santa Claus now? Me-- me-- merry Christmas, Mr. Smedke. What the hell. Job is job. All right, let's get going, Santa Claus. That's real genius! How'd you do it? Well, I wouldn't go so far as to say all that, but I think it's pretty evident that he is concerned about his child. But I feel that he honesty believes that she can't be helped, and he really doesn't want to have to go through that disappointment. But if I can get his confidence, then I could teach him how to help her himself. Maybe that'd compensate for whatever he's feeling guilty about. How are you at phonetic sounds? Well, I had a couple of courses. Why? I think I have a job for you. OK. [sawing, singing] How you doing, Finn? FINN: Very good, Mr. Smedke. Good, good. You practice. You be good butcher. FINN: I'm almost done. All right, I will take a look at it in minute. All right. I have some bones here. We can put them in freezer. They will mash better. All right? [singing] Sandy, I want you to make me a chart. I want you to list all the phonetic sounds of the alphabet. And make up a color code. I think I'd like to try working in the area of sound in relation to colors with Maxie. Sound in relation to colors? Like psychedelic records? Well, maybe. But I want to know what we can do with different sense impressions. Mr. Moore! How are you? Oh, better now. Doc said she'll be good as new in a couple weeks. She was hurt? Oh, yeah. Listen, I don't understand. Well, you were in the bar. Oh, you're talking about your toe! I'm glad it's getting better. What can I get for you? Well, I was thinking about a couple steaks. Oh, that we have. Oh. Yeah, $2.15 a pound. Oh, you want something cheaper? Well, what have you got? All right, sirloin tip. Tastes just the same. All right? Give us a couple of those, yeah. All right. Those doctors, they don't know what they're doing nowadays. I'll tell you something. You have some trouble, you come to Smedke. He'll take care of you, and cheap! Come on! Chop chop chop! No more toe! You can use for Irish stew, but you have to watch for toenail. $2.65. OK. Listen, how is Maxie? Oh, she's fine. Ah, she's sweetheart, that girl. Oh, yeah, give me a pound of bacon, too, will you? Bacon? Sure. Yeah, was there anything wrong with that bacon you gave Maxie yesterday? Wrong? Yeah, she threw it out. Why? I don't know. She threw out the bacon, and a couple of-- couple of pork chops, and-- The chops, also? Yeah, all the meat. I don't know. Listen. You take this. We are even. No, no good. I'll pay for it. Please! You take it, we are even! Well, if you say so. Finn! [snaps] Come here. And bring the truck! Because I want you to drive, uh, Mr. Moore. He has bad toe. -No. Hey, look, no, no. Forget it. I can make it alone. Please, I insist! OK. I'm really happy. Well, I know Alex was going to do something about it. He just didn't know how to go about it. He, uh, he's proud, you know? You really like that guy, don't you? Yeah. He's, uh, he's hard to get close to, but well, I've known a lot of guys. All kinds. But under that shell, he's, you know, he's really a nice guy. Otherwise I-- Oh, and that kid. I could love that kid. It was all I could do to keep from hugging her to death. Oh, thank you. What about his wife? Has he ever told you anything about her mother? Not much, um, except that she's dead. I think she died in the hospital when Maxie was born. He doesn't like to talk about it much. It was an awful shock. You know, first his wife, and then Maxie. I mean-- I mean the kid being deaf. Did he say where she was born? Fresno. I don't remember what hospital. Why? Might help if there's a record on it. I'll check it out. Want me to ask him? No, you better not. He's gone this far. Let's not make him think we're getting too nosy. He-- he may back off. Well, I don't think he has anything to hide. Well, probably not, but you never know. Maybe his wife isn't dead and he doesn't want her to know where he and Maxie are. FINN: You got a little daughter, don't you? Yeah. Do you know her? Yeah, sure. She, you know, she comes-- she comes in the shop. Newspapers. Yeah, right. Cute kid. Too bad, ain't it? Why? She-- she-- she can't hear, can she? No, she can't. I guess she was born that way, huh? Yeah. We had a dummy in the orphanage I was in, too. You know? She used to go on making these funny noises all the time. [moans] You know? I guess she didn't know she was making them because she couldn't hear herself. Used to irritate the hell out of me. Hey, you want to pull up, uh, right in that driveway there. Sure. On the right. Yeah. You don't like talking about it very much, do-- do you? I guess it's-- it's-- it's kind of funny having somebody around who can't talk. Yeah, well she's going to learn. Well-- well-- well, what do you mean? I thought she couldn't-- couldn't hear. Well, she can't, but there's this doctor who's going to teach her how to talk. Well, thanks for the ride. Any-- any time. How can you? Sme-- Sme-- Smedke ain't gonna like this at all. Whew! Not at all. [frogs croaking] [engine roaring] [knocking] [knocking] Coming! Oh, Doctor, come on in. How you doing, Alex? Fine. Boy, that's a heavy-sounding car you've got. Yeah, it's a hobby I picked up in college. How's the foot? Oh, a lot better. Want a beer? Sure, I'll be glad to. Here. Oh, thanks a lot. Well, what do you do first? Well, we get acquainted. Get to know each other a little better. Does she do this all the time, Alex? Oh, yeah. She's always drawing. She's got thousands of them in her room. She, uh, she wants to show them to you. Oh, I see. Don't-- don't go. You'll just get hung up there all night. Well, this is important to us. Right now she's thinking in pictures and events. What we have to do is teach her to break it down into words. She has to understand what talking's all about. Come on, let's see what she wants. All right. What I want you to do is mash these bones to bits, like that. See? Mash, mash! Then you take powder, and you put it in bucket. But do not leave until you are through, all right? Then when you are through, you will understand what would happen if that little girl could talk and tell everyone what she saw in Smedke's butcher shop. All right? Hey, you know something, Alex? She's a very bright child for her age. She's communicated all these TV shows that she's seen. You know, it's too bad that you didn't send her to a lipreading school. Well, we can go into to that later. Look, you're supposed to teach her to talk. I didn't say nothing about no school. Look, man. Except for being deaf, she's a bright, intelligent child. You've got to do more than just feed and clothe her. What's going to happen to her when you're not around to take care of her? Look, I didn't ask you here. If all you can think of to do is sit on the floor and look at pictures, maybe you better take a hike. Look, I'm sorry. I'm sorry I've upset you. [sigh] Fixed another flat here. Let's see. I think that's got it. [exaggerated laughing] [laughing] [phone ringing] I think we're making some progress, don't you? Yeah? Yeah, that's me. Who told you that? Look, hey, just because some spade doctor tells you he thinks he can make a deaf girl learn to talk don't mean I'm going to let him experiment on my daughter. Who told you that? She's my kid! If you don't want to talk about nothing else, you can hang up! You know, I don't know what your problem is, mister, but Maxie's going to learn how to talk. Whether you like or not. My problem is I don't want you messing around in my life. Now if I here of you seeing her again, I'm going to call the cops and I'm going to tell them that I know a doctor who likes to play games with little girls. How about that? Wow, man. You know, I'm glad your daughter can't hear. Because you're sick. You're sicker than I thought. You're not trying to protect her from anything outside. You're trying to protect her from something that you're trying to hide. Look, I don't need you coming in to tell me that! Pick up your goddamn coat and get out of here! Look, this is your house, and she's your daughter. But don't put your hands on me. Not ever. Just get out. Go on. We don't need you here. Finn! Come on out. Sorry, I forgot all about you. Let's see. You look like icicle. I'm sorry. All I was thinking about was that damn doctor! He gets that little girl to talk, we have real trouble! I don't want anything from you anymore! What do you mean? Here are your bandages! I don't care anymore! I don't want anything to-- Finn! Finn! No! Finn! DOCTOR: This is a doctor's office, not a motel. We had a date! I just wanted to stick around and see how it went with you and Maxie. I didn't want to be a surgeon. I knew I couldn't take it if a patient ever died on me. Get so close that you lose your objectivity. I blew it. Get the hell out of here and leave me alone. SANDY: Will you be all right? DOCTOR: Save your sympathy for the patients. I'm a doctor, remember? Get out of here. [brakes squeal] [scream] [crickets chirping] [siren wailing] [FROGS CROAKING, CRICKETS CHIRPING] [footsteps] [siren wailing] How'd it happen? OFFICER: We had a hit-and-run. DOCTOR: Who? Both of them dead? [church bells ringing] [phone ringing] [music playing] [engine roaring] [panting] Get! Get over here! You stay there! You hear me? You stay there! Don't you move! You wake up? You fight? Go ahead, fight! I'm not fooling around. You stay back there, you hear me? You hear me? Fred? Hi, this is Gert. Let me speak to Alex, OK? Alex? No-- now, wait. I want to say something. Listen. No-- No-- I-- I don't care what you think of me, and I don't care what you said. I don't care about getting lost or any of that. I'm going to say something, and you're going to listen now. I think that you are one hell of a lousy father. No-- now, wait a minute. Now, listen to me. You don't ever have to see me again. It doesn't matter. I mean, if you've got a wife, I don't care, somewhere-- it-- it doesn't matter. But I don't-- Maxie is-- you got her dressed like a little boy. She never-- when I put her in the car, she never rode in a car before in her life! She's there, on this house, and all by herself. There's nobody around! She doesn't have anybody to play with! She doesn't have anybody to talk to! You just-- you can't do that to her! That's all I wanted to say! I got to leave for a while, OK? Flap, flap your-- like that. You see it? Like that. That's right! No. Come on. Flap-- flap your wings, you little chicken. You little chicken. Caused me all that-- all that trouble. It's all your fault! If Smedke could see this now. [chuckles] Come on! Come on. [laughing] FINN: Come on, flap! Flap! That's right! Right! I got another idea where she might be. MAN: We'll find her. [knocking] DOCTOR: Go away. Office is closed. Hey. Have you seen Maxie? No, I haven't seen Maxie. Why would I see Maxie? You're her father! Well, now, I-- I thought because last night-- I just thought she might be here, that's all. She's disappeared. I can't find her anywhere. DOCTOR: Disappeared? ALEX: Yeah. DOCTOR: You are serious, aren't you? ALEX: I though maybe she ran away. Yeah, it's her wagon. We'll be able to cover more territory if I take you guys back to the garage and get another cab. Have dinner for you. It's ginger ale, and half of my dinner, and a hot water I got, and a Snickers. And it's really good. I'm gonna take a little bit, and leave you the big half, OK? Now, now, you eat all that, because it's good for you. I'll see you soon. I'll be back in a few minutes, so don't-- don't-- don't try anything. I'll be ready for that. [loud banging] MAN: The keys are in the car. You want to drive? I don't think I'd pass a sobriety test if we get stopped. Uh-- uh-- peekaboo! See? It's not real. God damn it! Stay the hell out of the road, will you? Hey, take it easy! Pull over here for a minute! What's wrong? Is it your foot? God damn it. I shouldn't drive. I blow my top too easy. I always did. That's how my wife died, you know. We were coming home from a movie. This kid passed me up and I got hot, and so I chased him. I ran a red light, got broadsided by a truck. She died on the way to the hospital. I-- I hadn't driven since. Let's get started, huh? FINN: I didn't-- I didn't mean to hurt you. I don't think I really hurt you before, did I? We were just playing. I just don't want you to tell anybody what you saw. Would-- would you-- would you promise me you won't-- you won't say anything that-- if they teach you to talk, then-- Smedke was being so, so nice to me until you-- you had to do that. You want an M&M? You want some? Here's some candy. I'm-- I'm-- I'm going to call Smedke and tell him that I-- that I have you here, mad. Maybe he's still not gonna be mad at me. Cen-- cen-- central meat market, please. Hello? Gue-- gue-- guess who, Mr. Smedke? Don't-- don't-- don't be mad at me. Because you don't-- you don't know who I have sitting right here in front of me. Don't-- don't yell at me! I have the-- the dummy with me. Bring her here! I am going to break your shoulder! You hear what I tell you? Now stop laughing and bring her here. And hurry! [police scanner] Well, we-- we're going to be back home soon. And everything's going to be all right. Wow! L-L-Look how beautiful it is out. Where-- where you-- where you going? Get back here! Get back! [inaudible] [screaming] Come on. Come on. Come on. You're all right. Come on. Come on. Hey, hey, hey. Look, you want a piece of butter oil? Yeah? A little-- maybe some cheese? You like cheese? I'll bring you some cheese, all right? Wait, no, I'm your friend! Now, wait a minute. Put it down. Put it down. Don't play games. Don't play. Don't play. Oh! [siren wailing] Finn? Finn, is that you? Finn? Finn, is that you? Finn? Finn, is that you? Finn? Finn, is that you? [screaming] DOCTOR: Ma-xie. DOCTOR AND MAXIE [TOGETHER]: Ma xie. Ma-xie. MAXIE: Ma-xie. Ma-xie. Ma-xie. DOCTOR: That's you! [music playing]
