Someone you know? Yeah. But I'd rather I didn't. LET'S MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE Kari? Kari… I asked you what it is that scares you in social situations. First, there is the reason that everyone sees. The topmost reason. Underneath it, hidden, there is another one. Even deeper… there is the third one, until you don't even see it yourself. When I first started off… as a crime investigator in Lappeenranta… the local paper wrote: "Sorjonen brings… serious crime with him." What if it's true? What if it's true that it is simply because of your diagnosis? Who is the Canadian psychotherapist? The one that said, that a person can wish never to cause harm to anyone? Like a rabbit. It won't do anything bad, but it also won't achieve much in life. We're not rabbits. People have to be useful somehow. …out of the five who won the poll, three are reportedly missing… Sorjonen, you have a visitor. Frank, a break. -Is everything okay? -What's your educated guess? We found a mural at the rail yard. Lasse Maasalo, wouldn't you say? Why are the police interested in his picture? The paint is blood. They took my turn. A bottle of the same blood was left at the police station. I can't play now. The message connects it to the mural. People have to sometimes forget laws created by people, if they want to make the world a better place. A poll is circulating on Facebook and Twitter, asking without whom Finland would be a better place to live. Suspected of sexually abusing 34 children, Samu Martikainen came in first. The blood came from Martikainen. No, thank you. Out of the top five, three have been reported missing. Kari. I'm in the hospital. I understand. My responsibilities include taking antidepressants morning and night and going to bed at ten to stay awake. I'm worried more people will die without your help. This man is a genius. The Santa Claus of crime investigation. -Sorry, I'm busy. -We need his brain. You can't have it. It's not in working order. Yeah. I understand. I'm aware of everything you've had to endure. -Sorry. I shouldn't have come. -Of course you shouldn't have. "Let's make the world a better place." Lasse said that in court. So Maasalo is involved. Anyone could have taken the words from the trial, records, newspapers. Plenty of lunatics admire him. -I'll leave this to you. -No, you won't. The accused has confessed, when questioned, to 11 murders, 18 manslaughters, and his involvement in three murders. Even in light of the crime history in this country, this is extreme and exceptionally brutal. I believe that exceptional people do what normal people can't do. It is their burden. You all need these individuals. UNCLE SAMU RELEASED FROM REMAND WESSELIUS: "ALWAYS DO AS YOU SAY!" LET'S MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE MAKE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE POSITIVE FOR BARBITURATE: METHITURAL WITHOUT WHOM WOULD EVERYTHING BE BETTER? 9. KATIA JAAKKOLA 7,1% KATIA JAAKKOLA Excuse me. I can hear… There must be someone in a manic phase. You can go back to bed, Kari. Sweet dreams. Heikkinen. The blood from the victim, Martikainen, it included traces of methitural. -A sedative. -You woke me up. Why are you calling at night? Because your case involves Lasse Maasalo. He is in the Riihimäki prison serving a life sentence. He used to give his victims methitural. It's not publicly known. The killer must know Maasalo. Why didn't you mention Katia Jaakkola? She wasn't in the top five. The perp talked about the top five. Katia is… She is close to our family. I called Lena about her. If… If they get five without getting caught, why would they stop at that? Because you'll help us. You have to meet with Lasse Maasalo. I refuse to talk to anyone. Or to see anyone. You're the only one he will meet. Kari. You are. No, I'm not. Is it hate speech to ask if Finland would be a better place without a pedophile? How many of you voted without realizing that some might not see the poll as merely a theoretical question? I will rephrase this. I promise that here you can freely, without consequences, say exactly how you feel. How many of you would rather see pedophile Samu Martikainen dead than set free? This is a lecture. Heikkinen, Bureau of Investigation. I would like to borrow Janina Sorjonen. Go ahead. Where are we going? To Riihimäki. Why there? There is a prison there. Does my dad know about this? His idea. If Maasalo threatens you in any way or tries to approach you, we will intervene and end the interview there and then. The room was emptied for you. There are more guards. Please move aside. In order to get you here, I had to promise not to let you out of my sight. -Lasse won't speak with you there. -You shouldn't be here alone. I was told I would meet Sorjonen. I was expecting a different Sorjonen. The police want to know what you know about the missing people. I'm writing my thesis. It is based on your case. I'm not the kind of narcissist that enjoys talking about himself. I wonder why I was warned. What should I be scared of? A prisoner once threatened me. A big fellow. Said he would rape me. He described the penetration. I talked with him. He severed his own jugular with a plastic knife. So, you could manipulate someone on the outside to commit a crime? You're not your father. He isn't capable of evil. You are. Just imagine… someone siccing one of the guys on you. Forcing themselves into you. That would turn you into what I am. I tried to get a boy to do a bad thing. I tried to get him to attack me. You tried to manipulate him to attack. How do you get someone to do what they did to Martikainen? I will tell you, but publicly at your lecture. Hey! How can I find out about slaughterhouses nearby? -What do you need it for? -Blood needs to cool. You need to know how… to extract the blood. You need equipment. And a place. What exactly is this about? Kari? Kari? I tried to get your father to understand that in the end better individuals try to fix flaws in the world. You said that in court. We are not all equal. The better people have to dare to do what others won't. What does it have to do with finding out who killed Martikainen? The killer delivers justice and fixes the world. They are, in a way, a judge. The Helsingin Sanomat newspaper used the same term. It's a fitting name. Are you ready for this? You left too early. I sought help because I was too scared to walk out the door. Now I stepped out the door. ROIMU MEAT Dad? Thick-soled shoes, size 39. Possibly a woman. Why are the footprints there? The person must have worked by the hooks. There's someone here that shouldn't be here. Someone you know. They were here before we got here. They're back there with the police. Kari? Lena. KARI SORJONEN CRIME INVESTIGATION EXPERT Not an officer. How did you get here? To the slaughterhouse. Because of Katia. Did you follow someone here? I heard on the radio about the blood mural. I did the math. No one has touched me for three months. Almost half of us said Martikainen would be better off dead. The death penalty just isn't… fit for a civilized country. -You're part of the monopoly on violence. -How? -You are with the police. -I used to be. Neither of you is actively serving. You do this because you worry about Katia. Dad does this because he doesn't know how not to. Katia is smart. She might be hiding somewhere. Were you in Poland or in trouble? The car has Polish plates. You infiltrated Poland on behalf of the FSB. In Warsaw. How did you find the slaughterhouse? I've never lied to you. Never. But I have to Heikkinen. So, you will tell me. You know how the bureau works. If they knew, they would make an arrest and mess up all the leads. If they knew what? I saw someone bring the blood to the police station. I saw their clothes and how they moved. Did you follow them to get to Katia? They live in an old camper van. You have to talk to the police. I don't have to do anything. Come in. Who's there? Sorjonen from the police. Hello. Hello. How can I know that's genuine? I can give you a direct number you can call. -Well-- -I can call it out from the door. -Zero. -Zero. -Two. -Two. -Two. -Two. -Nine. -Nine. -Eight. -Eight. -One. -One. Oh wow. Lena left. She couldn't sit still. But I get it. Get what? About Katia. That's for you. Did you see this? I am going to give a talk at the Helsingin Pohja Society. It's a fuddy-duddy organization where they don't want women. No idea why they want a young sociology student to give a lecture. So, I decided to dress up as something they're afraid of. What they don't want there. Katia only dressed up as a man. According to the comments, as a Muslim man, in a wheelchair, waving a pride flag. It was just a misjudgement. She took it too far. She wanted to anger these men. And angered everyone. You used to be friends. What happened? My dad lost his marbles. That explains a lot. Why leave this? She probably trusts Sorjonen to find Katia. -It's all calm. You can come. -Everyone, move in. Stun grenade! -Police! -Hands where we can see them! -We'll let the dog loose. -Let it loose! Get up. Turn your back this way. Hands where we can see them. Get on your knees. Hands out and behind your back! The other hand! Timo Lauermaa. Life hasn't been kind. Approved school. Suspended from trade school. Five convictions for shoplifting. Drug abuse. Outbursts at the employment agency, unemployment. Foreclosures. This kind of life… sucks all the blood from you. I got it. Got what? What you said. The files don't tell us how you know so much about slaughtering. Was that a question? No. It wasn't, technically. Why do you know so much about slaughtering? What if I don't want to talk? Can I just be quiet? The best police officers are looking into your background and where you've been, in relation to the murder of Martikainen and the disappearance of three others. We have this investment property that we have been renting out. The people in the poll started going missing, so I told Lissu-- You mean Anna-Liisa? Yeah. I told her to go there. Your wife has gotten hate mail after the malpractice case. The old people dying wasn't her fault. As a manager, she took the blame. That's when all hell broke loose. You saw something when you took food to your wife. Someone followed me into the hallway. But not the man you saw earlier? I didn't see their face. But I don't think so. You don't? They were wearing a hoodie and an army-style jacket. Black shoes. They seemed to be quite sinewy. But it could be the same person? I really can't say. Why didn't Lena tell us this before? She wanted to protect her daughter. She thought she'd get ahead of the perp without the police. If it was your daughter, you would do the same. Although there is no testimony, how sure can we be of catching the right guy? Our men are looking for evidence. We are sure. Aren't we, Kari? -I'd like to look at his van. -Your job is done. Three others are still missing. And Martikainen's body. Don't you want to know? I want you to go back to treatment. I want to see you get healthy. That man's IQ is the same as his shoe size. How could he have planned the crime? You don't think he's the Judge? Did you find out who created the poll on the internet? Or how Maasalo handled his contacts from within a prison? The cyber department couldn't trace anything. At least not so far. So the perp is talented. -We will take over now. -I would appreciate more help. Heikkinen will only take me to see this van. SHOPPINGLIST - BAND-AID MILK CEREAL TOILET PAYPER PEA SOUP BREAD A KEEPSAKE FROM ULLA Well? He didn't write the text or paint the mural. He can't hold a pen well enough. -Maybe the mural was commissioned. -How? The Cartoon guy can't even spell "shopping list" properly. How does that prove that Lauermaa isn't the Judge? Maybe, looking at the photo… this Ulla knows why. You could be right. We got a tip about another mural. SOME SAY THEY DO… ANDERS WESSELIUS WHO MADE A FORTUNE ON STOCK TRADE: "ALWAYS DO WHAT YOU SAY!" Heikkinen! "Others do as they say." Second one on the list. "The poor might as well die." Wesselius. He was of the opinion that people who are on welfare are welcome to kill themselves and that society should be for those that work. "Some say they will, others actually do what they say." Fitting for the Judge. "Some threaten to kill, others kill those they threaten." Are you not examining the body at all? Kari? They were here. The Judge. Get forensics to check this out. Should I do the interview? I can do it. I'll do it. Although I'll have to do something I don't want to do. You know both of them, don't you? I don't want to talk. You are this boy. It was easy to find out who this woman is. You're sitting here in your Aunt Ulla's lap. You lived with her often as a child. We are interested in Aunt Ulla getting married. She changed her name to Martikainen. Samu Martikainen is your step-uncle. You were about six years old in this photo. Samu was a little over 20. When your aunt went to work, your step-uncle came to your bed. He abused you. For years. When the Judge contacted you and said you could take revenge… help other kids and seek payback for the past, you decided to do it. You helped the Judge get the blood. Isn't that right? Your aunt divorced Martikainen when you were 11, but that was too late. Then she found a new husband, Matti Roimu. I can imagine you spending your summers at his slaughterhouse. Helping out with little things. Carrying bottles of cow blood into the fridge. Who is the Judge? I don't know who it is. What are they like? I've never met them. I just took stuff where I was told to. I've never met them. How did you find out about Samu Martikainen? They sent me a letter. Or letters, to a P.O. box. You burned them. Did they tell you to burn them? Did you kill Samu? Did the Judge bring him to the slaughterhouse? Well… He and the other one were already there when I got there. They were dead. I only took the blood. I didn't commit a crime. Samu and the other one? What other one? Another body? I only took their blood. What did you do with their bodies? Put them in the trash. Thank you, Timo. Thanks a lot. -The suspect doesn't know about the Judge. -They never met. -So we're back to square one. -We're in a hurry now. We don't know whose blood it is on the second mural. Not yet. Someone… promised to help us if we give them what they want. -No. -Lasse Maasalo. If Lasse gets out of prison to talk at the university, he will tell us about his connection to the Judge. We won't let him out. Heikkinen is right. Why would we give him anything? Anna-Liisa Suomaa. Max Aho. Katia Jaakkola. You have a task force, and you even have the military. Kari, we won't do that. The picture of Lasse and his words within the text. The methitural. Maasalo knows something. Can we ignore this? Let's discuss it with the Riihimäki prison. Did you sleep? If a light is brought into the presence of darkness, it becomes dim. But it won't become darkness. It only contains darkness. -What does that mean? -Nietzsche. If you're worried that Maasalo will influence you, remember that he can't change you. If you're sick, all your good deeds are sick, too. Nietzsche? Kari Sorjonen. Maybe he shouldn't have all the credit for that one. Nietzsche wasn't right in the head. Neither is Maasalo. He will try to control the discussion. Proving he is right, acting like a victim. He might not have been in touch with the butcher. Most likely, he has given advice on how to manipulate him. Maasalo wants to be superior. He can't be that if there is no opposition. You have to be a good opponent. HOW DID IT BEGIN? DID HOME LIFE HAVE AN EFFECT? Hey! Over here! The level of civilization in a society can be measured by how it treats prisoners. Let's not give these young people the wrong impression of our civilization. If someone feels anxious about this, you can still leave. The police will lock the doors for the lecture. Either leave now or stay. Docent in Applied Chemistry, Lasse Maasalo. How were you able to commit your first murder? Are we talking about practicalities or the mental side? The practical part is easy. It's easy to take a human life. Jerome Brudos said killing can require a lot of strength. He ripped his victims apart by hand. I use drugs… poison and… equipment. How about mentally? How about… Let's take the Judge as an example. That's who you wanted to hear about. Lonely. They've suffered because of society. They haven't had the courage to tell anyone about their emotions. All the pent-up anger. It had to be taken out on something. Or it would have destroyed them. So killing is a way to survive. They're not an evildoer. They're a victim. Everything inside of them screams… that those who are to blame for the pain need to suffer. First, you believe that violence relieves pain. That it creates balance and justice. That's not enough. Isn't that right, Janina? Many of us think that certain people deserve to die… but almost no one acts on that notion. You did. You told me. You wanted to break your boyfriend's mind. I tried to get him to hurt me. You were full of uncontrollable anger. You wanted to be the victim. You stepped over the line and did something bad. The world is full of angry people that have lost it all. If the Judge is caught, someone else will continue his actions. That's for sure. Maybe it's you. More and more often, society shuts us out. Then someone attacks you. The Judge shows us that you can get someone to do anything. Excuse me. I have a question. No audience questions. People can be made to do anything. The Judge painted your picture on the wall. Did you get them to kill? I meant that society gets them to do what they do. The Judge used methitural, the same sedative you've often used. Did you get them to do it? May I introduce Kari Sorjonen? He caught me. By cheating. The way he caught me proves that a person can be manipulated into breaking their own limits and morals. I got Kari to break his. So the Judge could have been manipulated? Of course. Yes or no? Did you do it? Wrong question. The question is: is the world a better place now that a pedophile, a financial criminal, a cheat, a killer of the elderly, and a moral fascist will soon be gone? I think it is. The Judge does good to us all. When your father tries to catch them, he's stopping the Judge from helping us. Your father is the bad guy in this story. We'd like to talk in private. Smart to send your daughter to me. But here we are now. The Judge was here, weren't they? I'm worried about you. And Janina. Her father's brain is not working. The girl could be a psychopath. Mental issues are genetic. I sensed shame. Janina had to talk about what she made her boyfriend do. Because there was shame, she's no psychopath. Or you saw what you wanted to see. I'm starting to see better again. Work has made me feel better. You're welcome. You promised to tell us about the Judge. To Janina. She came to you because I allowed it. The Judge is, indeed, close. But not in the way you think. You have been in touch with them from prison. Heikkinen wants us to go to Pathology. Did you find more people that ruin the world? Will you keep your promise? Janina asked me how I could commit my first murder. It was… touch and go. Like a child learning to walk. Slowly, I learned more. You always go back to your first victim. You compare all others to them. For me, it was Seppo Paltemaa. In Lappeenranta. For the Judge, it was Samu Martikainen. How did you contact the Judge? I get many letters and cards sent to me in prison. Some of them I can reply to. Although they read everything. For some reason… people tell me personal stuff. But that's not interesting. The interesting things are between the lines. Like in drafts. In drafts? Maybe you can read between the lines. Or the lines are blurred and the info gone. Trauma to elbows and knees. Cuts to the side. -He has been dragged. -The knees and elbows would suggest it. Or he could have fallen. Cause of death? A 22 to 24 centimeter stab wound to the heart. A financial criminal stabbed in the heart. -And the blood? -It's still there. The second mural was painted with different blood. Max Aho. Yes. FOR ME, WOMEN ARE JUST SEX TOYS According to dental records, parts of the body were found at the dump. Dispatch. Accident on the E12 and 130. Unit A2 en route. Outside the top five, only Katia has gone missing. -It's good news. -Janina thinks she might be in hiding. Griffin, copy. The Judge is systematic. People have died in the right order. -That gives us hope. -Is Kari right? Pirjo Kärnänen is number four. MY FRIEND, CURED OF HOMOSEXUALITY Is she safe? She's in Fagervik. We have a safe house there. A2, let us know when you find out what's going on. Roger that. The Judge is, indeed, close. But not in the way you think. What? A2, A1? What is going on? Answer! A2 turning back. Stop the car. Officer down. Maasalo escaped around five o'clock. Authorities haven't explained why he was allowed to leave the prison, where he is serving his life sentence. I am Tuomas Heikkinen, lead investigator in the case of Maasalo who escaped while in transit, as well as the shooting at the aforementioned location. You can't blame yourself. -Who else then? -Not yourself. I knew the dangers, but I did it anyway. So did you guys. It was for a good cause. Tuomas Heikkinen will tell us more about the investigation. For fuck's sake! It's affecting you, too. …are in critical condition. I was just clumsy. Maasalo affects you, too. …an email address for possible sightings. -Not just me. -But who? I can't tell you yet. Not until I'm sure. …their condolences to the families of the five officers who lost their lives. We hope the two critically injured officers pull through. I get many letters and cards in prison. Some of them I can reply to, although they read everything. The interesting things are between the lines. Like in drafts. LASSE MAASALO RIIHIMÄKI PRISON WARSAW, POLAND The car has Polish plates. Was it the FSB? You infiltrated Poland? They had a hoodie and an army-style jacket. What? Did Lena seem worried about Katia? She was being Lena. She didn't want to show it. You were also on the list. Yes. Can I ask you what you did? I tried to be smart and provoke an important discussion. I did provoke, but nothing important. 2:25 A.M. ALARM Do you want something to eat? No thanks. -Are you going? -Did the police offer you a safe place? I preferred going to my own place. If all goes well, you'll get some company tomorrow. Did the letters reveal what the Judge is like? Did you ever wonder if it was a woman? Did you see shoe prints in the slaughterhouse? No, I didn't. Why did you answer that one out loud? Normally you just shake your head. Look me in the eye and tell me why you said that. Why? Tell me why. Get in there! Drop it! Hands together and stay still. How bad is it? Ask about the hair we found at the shelter. See if you get a match on Lena. Where are you going? -Hello. -The shoe prints are a match for Lena. The hair, too. Taina wants to talk to you. Maybe I don't want to talk. You're on speaker. Lena is now wanted. I want you to come back. I'm sorry. Sorjonen, consultant to the bureau. Has this person tried to go through here? Veera? They went to the shore. Wait. Go. Get in the boat. -Get in now. -Lena! Don't. Don't! You followed me to find out about the investigations. You wanted to see what we knew about the Judge. Don't. You kept in contact with Maasalo. No. Why did you go along with this? We also found your shoe prints and your hair. The mural had a picture of a dagger, the same as on your back. It all points to you. Your brain's not working. Think about it. Put that away. You don't want to shoot me. Why would I paint my dagger on the wall? They weren't your shoes. No blood. -No. -Why are you doing this? Because you're not you. If you were okay, Maasalo would never have gotten you to suspect me. You can't help. You're no match for Lasse. Not in your state. Don't move. Lasse needs to be confronted by someone who is able to do something. You're not. I am. Okay then. I believe you. I had to do something. We need to go. Police! Stop right now! Don't come. I AM THE JUDGE Are they yours? They used them. -Don't. -It's evidence against you. The interesting things are between the lines. Like in drafts. The Judge is, indeed, close. But not in the way you think. The person's been next to us. What? The Judge. I've made a mistake. He's been where we've been. DRIVER'S LICENSE TERVAMAA HENRI OSKARI We have to check if his real name is Henri Tervamaa. I AM THE JUDGE -We need to find the address faster. -Kari thinks this is the fastest way. You know the password Lasse Maasalo used. And his email account. They can't be kept secret. His mail was being checked. Can you open his account? This is only a theory for now. I assume that this… is the shared email account of Lasse Maasalo and the Judge. The messages were written in drafts. One of them would write a draft, the other read it and then deleted it. No messages were ever sent. They left no traces. JUDGE. I'M FREE. TELL ME THE ADDRESS, AND I'LL MEET YOU THERE. That's my memory box. I cut my mom's hair once. Say something. Henri Tervamaa, 42 years old. Early retirement for medical reasons. Congenital disability, unemployed for 18 years. Lena's daughter Katia Jaakkola is most likely with him. Let's besiege the target. The target is a house awaiting demolition in Ingå. Let's go. Let's go. Come. You're not coming? My job is done. I'll stay and get patched up. Katia is there. Come. -You can't be serious. -Go. Kari, fuck you. Why won't you do anything to me? Nothing can happen to you. Why not? I'm on the list. -Rapid Response Unit ready. -Ready for action. Permission to raid. Field command, take over. Because of Katia, we will act fast. You're my leverage. That way, your mother will take the blame for this. Janina asked me how I could commit my first murder. It was… touch and go. Like a child learning to walk. You always go back to your first victim. You compare all others to them. For me, it's Seppo Paltemaa in Lappeenranta. Did you drive here? Dad? I have to check one thing. What if my mom agrees to it? To taking the blame. Will you then let me go? Police! Hands where we can see them! On the ground! Hands behind your back! You can't run anymore. Does it matter? We both know this doesn't lead anywhere. The border is in the middle of the lake. I've always been ready to cross it. You haven't. Isn't that right? If I get caught, it will all continue just the same. If you let me cross the border, I will go to Russia. You can keep your principles and morals and let me cross the border for you. It's good. Isn't it? You can't do anything. You're wrong. If you do anything, it will destroy you. You won't be Sorjonen anymore. Kari? Subtitle translation by: Ron Sawyer
