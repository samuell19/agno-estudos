It was dope living there. My little getaway where no one's trippin' on me. Bustin' Js all night. Just chillin'. Tappin' on heaven's door. Nothin' like Pop's crib. It was safe there. And I thought it would stay that way. Till it went postal. Twenty-three hundred students at Lincoln that day. And most of them didn't care about nothin', except gettin' over, gettin' blunted, and gettin' that ass. Take Rodney. He gave a whole new meaning to "super senior." Wouldn't even have been there if Spanky and his boys weren't trying to bust a cap in him. You 187, motherfucker! I want my loot! Be out here waiting on your ass all day. After six years, he finally had a reason to come to school. Now, Rivers, for him, it was all about the Benjamins. That's all you got? It's gonna be a beautiful day, sir. He wrote the book on getting over. Fuck! Shit. Oh, goddamn it. - And then, there was Lynn. - Fuck! Now, she thought she was just a little sick that day. But as it turns out, I guess Jimmy's hat wasn't wrapped too tight. So, what did you have to do, Lynn? Blindfold him? Purchase of prom picture packages, denied. Request for updated American history books, denied. Oh, and last but not least, the motion to organize a student career day... Denied. Most guys thought Stephanie was stuck up. Truth is, she just wanted to get out of the 'hood and never look back. I hate this school. Basically, just walk the halls. Let the kids know that you're here. So they understand that breaking the rules won't be tolerated. Establish a presence. Won't be any trouble. So I'm a deterrent? Exactly. It doesn't work out there, So what makes you think it's gonna work in here? I can imagine what you have dealt with, Officer Jackson. Normally, we don't get someone of your experience in here. Just remember, this isn't the streets. It's a school. Am I making myself clear? Jackson was a five dollar cop with a $50 attitude. He wanted to be anywhere but here. Trust me, Armstrong. When things get ugly, I'll just give 'em an F. Then I'll call for backup. Then there was Lester. Forty? Give me the tickets. I'll get the rest, all right? Yeah, right, and I'm gonna have Madonna's next baby. Look, man, I need some kinda collateral. Company policy. How about that watch? That's no happy meal, bro. I can't give you this watch, man. Look, maybe something else. Yo, Stephanie. Lester, whatever it is, I don't want to hear it. You want to ride the space shuttle, you gotta pay the fuel bill. All right, how about these? If you had a gun, they'd call you a criminal. All I gotta say about Lester is that's my boy. No matter what, he always had my back. Everybody wanted to blame what went down on Lester. Truth be told, he was the quiet riot in all of us. Hey, little man, what you doing? You can't sit here. You're blocking traffic. I... I just need to finish this. I said you can't sit here. Did you hear the warning bell? What? Hey, come on. Move. Get up. What, man? I'm just waiting for a friend. What's your name? Julius Zacharias Malone. My friends call me Ziggy. Ziggy? All right. I'm new here. But if I tell you to move, you move, all right? Yo, Ziggy, you all right? What's the problem? Hey, this doesn't concern you. Step back. - My friends concern me. - Everything's cool. Is that right? Yeah, that's right. Come here for a second, son. I'm not your son. Lester, man, chill out. - Oh, you like playing games? - Love 'em. Good. Here's one you should know. Assume the position. What? I said assume the position. Man, you trippin'. What's up, Lester? Man, that's fucked up. Don't let him put you on the wall like that. Get the fuck outta here. This is whack, man. You cops think just 'cause you got them pop guns, you can come around here and treat people any way you want? Hey, that's way outta line. You need to cool it. Cool it. Yo, there's the bell. We gotta go. Come on, Les. This is the part where we walk away quietly. - Right, Officer Jackson? - Right. Thank you, Officer. Come on. Come on. Bitch-ass cops, man. Yo, dawg, squash that. Hey, man, you all right? I'm cool. Hey, uh, yo, I brought these for you, man. Keep them hands warm till you get famous. Thanks, man. Hey, man, we late. Let's go. Come on. I know it's cold in here, but even a frozen mind is a terrible thing to waste. I was gonna show you a video today on the power of the media in the twentieth century, But unfortunately... Look at Iron Mike with the heavy balls. Lester, you rough, kid. I saw you pulled by Five-O earlier today. Okay, everybody, settle down. Badass Lester. As I was saying, unfortunately, the VCR is busted, so we're gonna have to go to Plan B, which is I talk and you listen. Just like at home. Well, I hope not, Rivers. I want you to pay attention. Now, those of you that have textbooks, please take them out. Those of you that don't, please share with someone that you don't have a vendetta against. It's so cold in here, man, you can see your sentences. Everybody, come on, now. Yo, Stephanie, uh... I would like you to turn to page ten. We have a lot of ground to cover today. Media coverage of the social movement can aid in education... Yo, you're down with Lauryn Hill, right? She's at The Garden this Friday, and I figured, you know, it's sold out. Maybe we could go together. I can't, Lester. Lester. Stick with me on this. So, we left off discussing how the twentieth century was the first time in history that the media... When Wanda and Tanika heard I had these tickets, they were sweatin' me. I said, "Nah. I'm saving myself." They said, "For who, Lester?" "For whom, Lester?" Now, who else can we say came to power over the airwaves? Jerry Springer. Tupac and Biggie. Ginger Spice and Mr. Hankey. I said, "For the first woman on the moon." I said, "For the first woman senator..." "From New York." I said, "For the first president of the United States" "who happened to be Puerto Rican," if you know what I mean, Boricua. ...and factions. Lester, excuse me for wanting to hold class, but I really... Mr. Knowles, I can't feel my legs. We could burn some books. There aren't enough to keep us warm. Let's hunt down another room. Everybody, come on. Let's mount up. And, Lester, you're with me. Any more questions? Rasheed? The library's full too. Okay, look. Why don't you people just hang out here for a while until our scouts come back, okay? Quietly, okay? Hey, hey, hey. Come here. Coach Davis told me that you quit the team. You're shooting bricks in class. What's going on? Nothing, man. You want me to fail you? Is that gonna get your attention? How's your dad's case going? Won't be one, man. Case closed. They said it was an accident. Cafeteria's bumper-to-bumper. Three Classes. I'm sorry about that. How's your mom taking it? - Bad, man. Real bad. - Look, why don't you come by and see me at the end of the day? We'll go to the gym, play a little one-on-one. We'll talk. - Okay? - Okay. Gym's filled. How about the auditorium? Mr. Wittner's class. This is really messed up, Mr. Knowles. Okay. Okay, people, follow me. Let's go see the man behind the curtain. And I'll cover the other class. For crying out loud, come on! I've got close to 35 kids in each of these classes. Come on! Help me out here. Hey, Allan, you got a minute? Eleven o'clock, the superintendent will be here. Hold on a minute. You tell him that if he really wants to help, to get his butt down here and take over one of these classes. Stop monopolizing my time with this bullshit. Eleven o'clock will be fine. I know I've troubled you before for such luxury items like books and chairs, but the window is still broken. Kenny, you know I've been on the phone for months talking to downtown, trying to get windowpanes. Now, you just... wait a minute. Are those your students out there in the hall? Yeah. You can ice skate in my classroom. We've been everywhere. No, Kenny, take 'em out. Get 'em anywhere but in the hall, all right? Come on, man. That's a fire hazard. You know, a fire might be good here. Warm up the school. Anywhere. So, with King and Gandhi, we've got these two great minds on opposite sides of the world changing the course of history. For a cheeseburger and fries, - what do they have in common? - Stop it! They're both dead. Mr. Knowles. Rivers. I was just wondering, if we know the answer, could we substitute a combo meal at Mickey D's instead of this place? Rivers, if you know the answer, I'll super-size it. Why do you even come to school? Mr. Knowles, they shared the philosophy that violence begets more violence. Yes. And? Um... Damn, Mrs. Einstein. Wait. You mean she's stumped? No. I must be dreaming. They were murdered, man. Peaceful resistance begets violence too. - They stood up for what they believed in. - Hey, Mr. Knowles? Lunchtime, motherfuckers! And you're buying! Put your hands where I can see 'em right now! Give me your fucking wallet! Give me your fucking wallet! What the fuck do you think this is, nigga, show and tell? I like this shit here. What the fuck we got right here? I like that piece you're flossin' on your wrist, nigga. Why don't you go ahead and hand that shit over? Give me the fucking watch, now! Lester, give it up. - What the fuck you think this is? - No. No? Nigga, I got the fuckin' shotgun! - Give it to him! - Give me the fuckin' watch. Aaron, is that you? I said no fucking talking! Shut the fuck up! It's Knowles. I had you in history. I don't know who the hell you are. Now sit the fuck down! Hey, I helped you get into Manual Arts. It's Ken Knowles. Mr. Knowles? Eight, nine, ten! He's outta here! What were you thinking? Taking them off campus? There was no place to go on campus. I got Perez back there, the district superintendent. So what? This is my pension, man. Now, you leave me no other choice. Call your union rep. You're suspended. It figures, man. Knowles does something righteous, and this is how they talk to him. What were you thinking? What do you mean? You were gonna get yourself shot over a watch? Rob. Hey. What? We really gotta talk. Look, forget it, okay? I don't want to talk about it. I don't give... I'm outta here. Shit. Yo, Mr. Knowles, what's going on? Hey, um... I can't talk right now. I have to leave. What? Why? That's not important. What's important is that you get on to your next class. But we have you next period. - Yeah. - Right. Well, um, Armstrong's gonna get you a sub. - A sub? - Yeah. Wait. Yo, Mr. Knowles! Sorry, guys. They won't let me talk to you. Mr. Knowles! I'm really sorry, guys. Um, Knowles just used poor judgment. That's all. Hmm? Mr. Armstrong, sir. You know the rules, young lady. What are you... What are you doing in here? I have Mr. Knowles again this period, Regents Prep. I was just wondering where he was going. Um, Mr. Knowles is taking an administrative leave, okay? Just go back to your class until I can find you a sub. Leave? For what? That's not fair. Excuse me, please. You want to step outside, please? What is this? There was no place to have class. You were the one who said, "Take them anywhere." - Uh... - I heard you say that, Mr. Armstrong. That's right. This is none of your concern, okay? Go to class. We're supposed to study in a room that's freezing, and now you want to fire one of the few decent teachers still willing to work here? How does that not concern me? Look, um, Miss, uh... Go back to your class, all right? All of you. Come on, go to class. Not until you bring Mr. Knowles back. We want Mr. Knowles. Yeah. Where is Mr. Knowles, and what did you do? We want Knowles! We want Knowles! Get security. And hurry. Get security up here right away. That's not necessary. Look, all she wants is our teacher back. I don't need your help, Lester. You get down from there. You're suspended. What? You and you, the both of you. - Come on, man. Let's get out of here. - Nah, man. Get back to class right now! No. No? Okay. So the two of you don't want to leave? I'll tell you what. Have a seat right over there until I contact your parents. You're both suspended. - What? - Suspended for what? Mr. Armstrong, they didn't mean nothing. We were just freezing in Mr. Knowles' class. Why don't you understand that? Oh, well, all right. Then you can join the two of them. Me? Yes, you! You come back here, young lady! Williams! I know who you are. Heads-up, Five-O! Jackson, where the hell have you been? Come on, get these kids out of here. Get him! Steppin' through. And take these two. Put 'em in detention until I call their parents. Parents? - Come on, get out of here. - No parents. Look, you don't need to call nobody's parents or nothin'. Look, I'm going back to class. No problem, okay? But you're not, eh, Ziggy? What are you doing, man? This is bullshit! You had your chance. - She's right and you know it. - Let go of me! I don't want no explanation. Just go. Let me go! Let him go, man! He didn't do nothing! Ziggy! Get up. Come on, get on your feet. Let's go. - No! Get your hands off me! Get off me! - Settle down! - Let him go! - Get off! Settle down, will you? Get down! - Get off him! - Lester, stop it! Let him go! Let him go! - Wait, wait! No, listen! - Shut up! Get back! Oh, my God. Ziggy, give me the gun. I can't go home. Stay back. I gotta go. I can't go home. Give me the gun, man. Come on, man, just give me my gun back. Put the gun down. Easy, dawg. Ziggy, look at me, man. Put the gun down. You don't want to do this, listen. - Ziggy. - I gotta go. Ziggy, put it down. Please. Put the gun down. Give me my gun back. Look, man. You don't understand, okay? It's okay. Look, he can't go home, Officer. Just listen to him, okay? What, you want to go to jail? - I can't go home! - You wanna go to jail? 'Cause that's what's gonna happen to you unless you put that gun down now! He'll kill me, man! Put the gun down! He'll kill me! Ziggy, just put it down. He'll let you go. Right, Officer? No problem. He said he'll let you go. Listen to him. - Just give me my gun, okay? - I'm gonna leave. - Don't do this. - Just give me the gun back. That's all I want. You got it! I give up! I give up! No! Shit! Ziggy, you all right, man? - Oh, shit. - Get out of the way! Come on! Move it! Move! Son of a bitch. What happened? Call an ambulance. Get the police here. Tell 'em it's one of theirs. Maybe they'll hurry. - What happened? - This little kid here shot me in my leg. It was an accident. He didn't mean to shoot you. - It's not an accident. - He was trying to leave and you wouldn't let him go. He was trying to leave. His back was to him. Mr. Armstrong, I saw it. It was an accident. - Wait, wait. Look. - Come on. - Come on, get up. Get up! Take him into custody! - It wasn't his fault. No, listen, it was an accident! No! No! Lester! You goin' to jail. Look, it wasn't his fault! Let him go! Lester! Lester! - Lester! - Armstrong! Let him go! What are you... Put... Let him go! Put that gun down, son. You take your hands off of him, okay? Come on, behind me, money. Come on, Ziggy. Nobody's taking you anywhere. What are you doing? Put the gun down! Son... You listen to me, okay? I want everybody out of the school. Now. Lester, I'm outta here. No, wait, Rivers! No, don't leave, man. I need you. You saw what happened. Man, we gotta get out of here. No. Armstrong, I want you out of the school now, okay? No! I want you and every cop in the school out now! Have you lost your mind? You! - Come on, let's go. - No! You leave, he stays! Now! - Come on! - Go on. I'm fine. Gotta establish a presence, remember? Now! Go. I hope you know what you're doing, son. Think about it. This is the end for you.

Sounds like we got one kid with a gun, so, um, get me home for dinner. Second team. Two Men. We're here. - What are you looking at? - Just give it to me straight. You hate your mother? They wouldn't give you this whip for the weekend or what? What? They beat you up? They chase you home? Take your lunch money? What? What? Stop sweatin' me. You know, just 'cause you don't see 'em, it don't mean they ain't out there. They're out there. Twenty sharpshooters with Remington 700s. Blow a hole in you like a baseball.

Lester, son, how long you think it's gonna be before he takes that gun from you? You don't scare me, okay? Give me the gun! Give me the gun. Give me the gun. I don't want to hurt you. Now give me the gun! Give me the gun! Jesus, Lester, what are you doing? Nothing. Everything's cool. Good evening, ladies and gentlemen. A high school shooting is in the headlines today. The shooting grew out of an incident involving a roving band of students inside the school. Classes were in session when the officer was wounded while trying to attempt to subdue one or more... ...the bloody standoff. Stephanie Williams along with reputed gang members Zacharias Malone, Rodney Templeton, and Lester Dewitt threatened principal Allan Armstrong... Gang members? Hey, opie, I ain't shot nobody yet. I stood with these people. They're stone cold. I tried talking to them, but they pointed the gun directly at me, So I turn around and I broke. I don't want no bullet in my ass, 'cause they were killing, like, five cops. I was jumping over, like, bodies. I was, like, whoo, panicking, but I had to stay calm, 'cause I'm the hero in this situation. Unbelievable. Believe it. All them As and Bs you get don't mean jack. You're just like the rest of us. The fact of the matter is that there are 2,500 students in my school. Most of them are fine young men and women. The kids in there belong in jail, not in school. That's it. You belong in jail. What about the kids? Often by the time children like these get to high school, it's too late. Boo! Get the fuck out of here, man. Boo! ...to violence. The value of education, the notion of good or evil. Many of these kids are little more than human predators, Unburdened by the social and moral constraints we take for granted. You want to play like gangsters? Now you are gangsters. ANCHOR 3:16-year veteran of the force, Officer Dante Jackson made headlines recently as one of the principals in the Brooklyn National Bank shootout in which four people were killed. The decorated officer was assigned to the high school in a continuing effort to stem school violence. Say, word, man. You a hero? Now, what in the world would you have to do to get busted down here, huh? Yo. This is Audrey McDonald with the New York City Police Department. Who am I speaking to? who is it? - Hello? - Lester. Lester. How you doing, Lester? Everybody all right in there? You all right? Yeah, everybody's fine as long as you don't try to come in here. Check the hall. No one's gonna do that. Everything's gonna be all right now that I'm here. How's Officer Jackson doing? Sounds like he might need some medical attention. Pfft. Well, he shot himself in the leg, that's all. Bullshit! Give me the goddamn pho... I would like to hear the officer say he's all right. Is that possible? Well, anything's possible, Audrey, but, uh, maybe we can speak to some of the people on television who have been calling us thugs and criminals first. Is that possible? I can't control the media, Lester. Can I please speak to Officer Jackson? No. It ain't happenin'. Why? Because I'm making the rules. That's why. Team One in position. West stairway. Gate is locked and blocked with debris. Advance? Negative. Hold your positions. Lester, I don't know who's right or wrong. I don't care. But the sooner we resolve this, the better your chances are. My chances? I know exactly what my chances are. I watch TV. I know the drill. Lester, at least let me send in a doctor. How about that, Lester? A doctor? No! No doctor. Doctor'll be a cop. He'll be armed. How am I doing? No doctors. All right, okay, no doctor. You're in there, and we're out here. Tell me what you want so we can end this. Want from the cops? - Lester, give me the phone. - I'm starvin'. How about 50 pizzas from Pizza Hut? Extra, extra large. Martini, shaken and not stirred... Ask 'em for life insurance, Lester. We're fucked. Lester, don't listen to them. Give me the phone. Come on, Lester. Lap dance from Cameron Diaz! All right, knock it off. - Look, what do we really want? - Jesus Christ. - Lester, let me talk to them. - Bob Marley's Greatest Hits. Oh, I know, how about tickets to Hole? Come on, Lester, give me the phone. Yo, they're not giving you anything! I took a shot in my leg, and this is what you guys are asking for? There's a whole precinct of people outside just waitin' for you to say somethin'. - Say somethin'! - Shut up, okay? Okay, Audrey. Okay, you know what I want? You know what I want the cops to get me? My dad. Now deal with that. Lester? Lester? I need to talk to Dewitt's father. Only if you can channel. He was shot and killed three months ago. It gets worse. NYPD shot him. The family filed a wrongful death against the department. He wasn't armed. Jesus. Lester... Look, I know about your dad. I don't want to talk about it. Okay? Look out there. You say you're tired of people not listening to you. Well, everybody's listening. What do you have to say? I know you out there, motherfuckers. You can't fool me. I'm minister of defense, motherfuckers. Y'all want to play? Yeah, I hear you, motherfuckers! I know you hear me! Come on. Come halfway up those stairs. Jackson's gonna be toast before you make it to the library. I thought you said these weren't typical Lincoln students. Well, they shot a cop. I'd say that's not typical. Stephanie Williams, National Dean's List. Lester Dewitt, point guard, 3.5 GPA. Assistant manager at Foot Locker? Rivers Tremont, science and tech magnet. Handful of misdemeanors. They were pretty upset about something this morning when they came to your office, huh? Now, what exactly happened in there, Mr. Armstrong? My son Lester has never been arrested. He is no criminal. Now, what he's doing is flat-out wrong. I know that. But you have to understand that this boy, Lester, sat in a police station for two days, and no one, no one would speak to him about his father's death. No demands have been specifically requested... Fuck them silly-ass demands. What we really want is respect. Respect comes at the end of a nine with a fresh clip. Yo, Les, give Rodney here the phone so he can reinforce those stereotypes before it's too late. Don't get it twisted, Rivers. Just 'cause we in this bitch together don't mean we friends. So don't play me. No. I'm not playin' ya. You're playin' with yourself. You're about to go blind. So much for your respect. Fuck you! Fuck, man! Get off of me! Get off of me, you bitch! Stop it! Get off him! Get the fuck off me, bitch! - What the hell's your problem? - Get off him! Fuck, Rod! Break it up! Man, get off him! Hey, cut it out! Cut it out! Break it up! Break it up! Don't fuck with me, man! Straight up! Break it up, man. What are you doing? Yo, I'm sick of his big mouth. Without you, he'd be a little bitch. Look, man, I don't care what you do when this is over, okay? But right here, right now, look, you're either with them or you're with us. What is it gonna be? All right. My bad. You got it. What you laughin' at, man? See what I'm sayin', slick? It's just a matter of time. Holy shit, Ziggy. Jesus. Oh, my God. I'm okay. Just stop lookin' at me. Who did that to you? Hey, little man. Who did that to you? His old man. See, that's why he fought so hard, when Armstrong wanted to send him home. You see what you did? Do you? Do you? I'm just doing my job. Your job? How could I have known that? When did you ask? First day, first ten minutes, you made up in your mind who we were. Do we have something real to ask for or not? If not, what they said about us on television might as well be true. Look, what do we really want? Sure was cold in Mr. Knowles' class this morning. That's a demand. Good. Fix the broken window. And get Mr. Knowles back. Yeah, Knowles is cool. What else? Come on, I mean... We could fix the leaks. We could get some new books. We could have a career day. Career day? Oh, that's a great idea, Now that our future's so bright. It's worth a try. Other schools have it. What do you need a career for, anyway? - You'll just use your tits to get ahead. - Fuck you. - I - don't need these to get where I'm going. What the hell is your problem? We ain't got time for this shit. Can't even stop fighting. They're never gonna agree about anything. Since you seem to have all the answers, Lynn, why don't you tell us what it is that you want? Yeah, what do you want, Lynn? What I want has nothing to do with this school. I won't even be here in a few months. Oh, yeah? Where you gonna be? Yeah, Lynn, where you going? Yeah, where you gonna be at? Fat and sick, okay? Fuck you guys. Fools, man. We ain't gettin' shit. Dealin' with the cops, the only thing we're gonna get is shot up or locked up. Isn't that right, hero? Yeah. You're gonna end up that way one way or another. No, we won't. Because everybody out there is gonna know that this whole thing was an accident started by him. That's what I want. Hey, that ain't never gonna happen. Ever. Put it down. Write it down. Don't answer that. The telephone is for the Dark Ages. I mean, if we're gonna do this, let's do it right. Let's go global. What? "First we want to say "we did not shoot the officer." "He shot himself with his own gun" "while he was struggling to forcibly detain a student." Hey, what's the name of the high school in Queens where the kids have taken the cop hostage? Uh, Lincoln. I got it on my screen too. "This all began because of the conditions of our school." "We are not criminals." "We are not gang members "as we've been portrayed by the media. "Officer Jackson is not seriously hurt. "We will remain in Lincoln High "One, Mr. Knowles is rehired." "Two, students must have a textbook for every subject." "Three, fix the window." "Four, repair all leaks." "Five, establish a career day." "Six, once a month, we can give the teachers a test." "Hot 97, CNN, Howard Stern." What the hell is "The Source"? Books, fix the leaks, windows. This is bullshit. Someone in there wants these things. Right, you want books, so you take a cop hostage? They got a little power, now they want to walk? They got a better chance of getting into Yale. Chain of command? What are you saying, Audrey? All I'm saying is I can't make the final decisions. I gotta talk to my boss, who's gotta talk to... What you're saying is that you can't get us anything, right? So put somebody on the phone who can. Well, Lester, it takes time. I'm gonna get you what you want, but, you know, you know how it works. You gotta give us something. I mean, it's hurting you to keep that wounded officer. You give us nothin', and I'm supposed to give you the cop? Then what's gonna stop you from coming in here, huh, Audrey? Gratitude? Lester, look. I'd really like to hear what happened to your dad, from you. Like hell you do. Look, don't play with me, Audrey, okay? I... I'm not playing you, Lester. I know you're runnin' the show. Using the Internet was a brilliant idea. I just want to help. Many of your demands will be met if you give me some time. Then, Audrey... Yes? Meet them. Are you done playing or what? Come on, man, demands? That's bullshit. They're not gonna give us anything unless we start putting his ass on the phone and slicing off his fingers or something. Then you'll see how fast she'll be correct. I'm serious, Lester. You know how this is going to play out. No. We wait. You wanna wait? Wait. But they won't. Let's give them one. That's what we need to get Jackson out. Negative. I can't negotiate anything if you don't... You better find that teacher, Detective, Or my men will get Jackson out. Where's this guy, Knowles? - Hey. - Jesus. I mean, could I get some fucking privacy around here? No. What did I ever do to you? Listen, princess, I'm tired of smart and pretty girls always looking down on slags like me. When have I ever? You know what? The only reason you know I'm alive is because I diss you. I'm sorry. So, fat and sick, huh? I just wanted him to kiss me. I never even got the kiss. What are you gonna do? I don't know. It's just been, like, the most fucked up day. I'm really scared. Shit, you're scared? No. It's different for you. You've got, like, this confidence, this whole thing like, uh, above it all, you know. I know how to put on a good show sometimes, but I definitely hear what people have to say... But, Stephanie, you don't care, so it doesn't matter. Everybody cares, Lynn. Hey, you know, um... If I would have known this whole takeover thing was gonna happen, I never would have fucked him. Minister of defense, huh? That's some funny shit. Whatever it is you've been smoking, I got something better. Tch. Let me tell you something, man. A nigga like me is just a chalk mark waiting to happen. What the fuck you doing here? On the real, don't give me that movie-of-the-week bullshit. Like, you think you got some kind of monopoly on oppression? Shit. I'm the trailer park prince. And? You still ain't tell me what you're doing here. You know, my pops used to always brag about how his generation gave a shit and how we don't care about nothin'. You know, in the '60s, they had Vietnam to fight over. They had voting rights. They had all kinds of shit. Well, you know what? Now I got my own little war story to tell. And you know something? This might give my little bullshit life some meaning. You feel me? Yeah, I feel you. I feel you. These people are crazy. These people are just gangbangers, pulling out just guns, gasoline, M16s, TEC-9s. I don't know where you get them weaponry from. I mean, it's like Iraq, you know what I mean? Hey, Ziggy? Ziggy? Um... Take a look at your book? Um, I'm not finished. That's all right. I just want to see. Come on, Michelangelo. Come on. You can give me a little peek, a little preview. You know about Michelangelo? A little bit. I think that Sistine Chapel stuff is pretty cool. - Hmm. - You know, God's finger reaching down to touch his creature. Uh, can I... Can I... Can I look at it? Yeah. My favorite. You know, if I could be one painter, I'd like to be Basquiat. They call him "The Radiant Child" because he died so young. I mean, the both of them, what they do with paint... will last forever. My son used to draw. Daryl, he was a tagger. He'd use spray paints and... Whatever. Yeah? What was his tag sign? I don't know. You never saw it? You never asked him? I didn't want to know. He was breaking the law. You should've. Yeah, maybe. We get out of this, I'm gonna make sure that... I put whoever hurt you... in a place where they can't never touch you again. Yo, Ziggy, get away from him. Is this your son? Where'd you get that? You take him to Knicks games? Help him with his homework? Teach him to jab? Give it back. It's not yours. Give it to me! Must be real sweet. You know, Jackson... I bet he's out there right now. He's worried about his dad, the, uh, the hero. No, son, I haven't seen my kid in over a year. What'd you do, Jackson, huh? You jump all over him? Did you beat him up, too? That's why they sent you down here. I'm on leave. What kind of leave? Disability leave. Disability. What gets a cop on disability leave? Stress. Man. What do you know about stress? My wife... and my son... What, they're dead? No. They're lost. Lost to me, anyway. You know what that feels like, right? When you lose someone, and you can't afford to lose them. When your heart breaks. When you get a parasite in your guts. Makes you... do something mean or do something stupid. That's what this is all about, right? Right, Lester? This is about your dad. You're wrong. - No. - You're wrong, and you know something? I don't give a damn what you lost. Yo, yo, Lester, come here, check this out. Look at all these people, yo. Back off. Ha. Damn. Damn, look at this. Hey, Stephanie, Lynn, get over here. Yo, Rodney, Rivers, man, come check this out. Yo, everyone, get over here. Look at all these people, man. We on top of the world, yo. - Whoo! - Yeah, we blowin' up! There they are! Look! Up there! Hey! - What's up? What's up? - Whoo! Yeah! Whoo-hoo! Lincoln Six! Lincoln Six! Lincoln Six! - Lincoln Six! - What? - Lincoln Six! - What? Lincoln Six! - What? - Lincoln Six! Man, we heard bullets. I pushed the girl out of the way, 'cause I don't want her to get shot. But one of the bullets hit me in the ankle. I'm just limping. One in my culo, too, but, man, you know, I can't let that feel me. Wait, wait, wait! The crisis continues at Lincoln High tonight as negotiators fail to make any headway in their day-long standoff with what is now believed to be six students. Police have been held at bay by the group holding Officer Dante Jackson... Come on! We want Knowles back! - Yeah! - Yeah! Whoo! Lincoln Six! Lincoln Six, baby! Stay behind the barricade! You're runnin' out of options. Look out there. All it's gonna take is somebody throwing a brick through a window or firing a shot. We got half a dozen companies willing to repair the windows. We got textbook companies and roofers. Let's give them something. - He's here. - They shot a cop. I got here as fast as I could. Yeah! Whoo! Man, you fuckin' crazy. Hey, yo, you see what happens when you bring a gun to school? It's a long way from the fifth grade when I pulled that chair out from under you, huh? No doubt. You never know. We might still be able to make the Lauryn Hill concert, Steph. But you wouldn't go with me anyway, would you? No. Not a chance. Damn, girl. You're tough. Oh, Stephanie, Oh, my God. - I'm sorry. - Oh, my God. - I don't mean to laugh. - Look at my hair. Looks like Jennifer Lopez had a bad hair day. Nah, you look good. Yeah, kiss my ass, Rivers. You gotta grow one first. Yeah, right. Tch. Lost my ghetto card with that. Hey, I didn't know you were bald. Oh, as salaamu alaikum, brother. Whoo! Yes, it's true. I still love the Lakers, my brother. Yo, I seen this face on a milk carton or something. - Snap. - Aw, man. What's wrong with your eyes? I know, I know. Aw, it's so embarrassing. Oh! Where you hidin' the merchandise, Rivers? You don't want to know. Probably got a doobie in your right pocket. Yes. Always. Hello, my name's Lester. I like long, quiet walks on the beach. I'm a Sagittarius. - I like to wear triple X large magnum condoms. - Hey, I do. - Oh, really? - Yeah, right. In your dreams, Les. Sure, virgin boy. I gotta, um... I gotta use the head. Yeah, man, give me the gat. Cop has to take a leak. Look, look, man, just take him to the bathroom. Don't even worry about it, man. Just give me the gun, I'll take him myself. Look, go ahead and take him, man. I'm not giving you the gun, okay? What's the problem, yo? Just give me the gun. I'll be right back. Go ahead. I'm not giving you the gun, all right? All right, whatever. All right, come on, let's go. Well, Audrey, you see the crowd out there? Hey, Lester, it's Knowles. Mr. Knowles? What's going on, man? I'm doing what I... I'm doing what I had to do, Knowles. Is everybody okay? Yeah, yeah, yeah. Everybody's fine, man, even the cop. They're listening, right? Of course they are. I hope you're not doing this for me, man. You have to work the system, not jack it. Man, get in there, man! I ain't no bitch like Lester. I'll bust a cap in your ass right now. That's why they don't trust you with a gun. I don't even trust myself, man. Get in there, man. I cannot do it like this. I need you to... You gotta do it for me. What? I ain't with that homo shit. - Get in there! - Give me one of my hands, then. I should let you piss on yourself. Hurry up, man! Hey, it's Jackson! Come on, let's go! Get me out of here! Guys, I'm here! Hey! Jackson is free. Cut the power. Over here! Hey! Everything they're saying on TV is a lie. Look, they just... Oh, fuck! Shit. Lester? Lester! What the hell happened? What's going on in there? Somebody talk to me. Give me a... What's going on in there? Come on. Fuck. Shit. Yo, Rodney! I'm over here! Jackson got away! Any visual on the HTs? Any visual on Jackson? No visual on the HTs. - Rodney! - Rodney! If you hear me, say something! We gotta get Jackson. Hurry up! Where are you? Yo, I'm down here! Hey, yo, I'm over here! Get the sharpshooter up here. Jackson, don't you fuckin' move! Move away! Freeze! Drop your weapon, or I will fire! He's gonna fire! Shit, they're firing! They're coming in, man! Let's go! Who fired? I want to know who fired! Come on, get through it. Cut it. Go! Go! Go! You want war? Come on! Back off! Back off! I know a place. Come on! Come on! Come on! They're coming in! Come on, y'all. We gotta go! Up here! Get him up! Come on! Get him up! Get his ass up there. - Come on! - Shit! They're comin'! They're comin'! Fuck, man! Push his fat ass upstairs! They're comin'! They're comin'! Get up! - Move! - Where we goin'? Ziggy, where we goin', man? This is a fuckin' dead end! Great. Now what? Where we goin', man? To my place. Hurry. They'll never find us in here. They're right below us. I'm gonna fuckin' kill you, man! Be quiet, man. Hey. Be quiet. Pete, anything? Any visual? Let's go! Let's go! You all right? Yeah, I'm okay. Look, they gotta know we still got him And that he's all right. Without letting them know where we are? How the hell we gonna do that? Stop it, Rodney. - Fuckin' stop it already. - All right, quiet. Hey! They're gonna hear us. Hey, Les. Didn't want you to use all my free minutes till it was worth it. - Where's Jackson? - We lost him. Hallways, stairways, classrooms, all clear. Do you have a 20? Got nothing in the stairwell. All clear. Nothing, sir. Hallway's clear, sir. They're gone, sir. What do you mean, gone? Sweep it clean. Copy. We've got a relay from 911. It's them. You wanna kill us, Audrey? That it? That's your plan? That's the last thing I want to have happen. Is everyone all right? What do you care? The officer shouldn't have fired. It was an accident. An accident? It's always an accident with you people. You give us... you give us something, okay? You give us one of our demands. Or Jackson will be an accident. You hear me? Do you hear me? - Yes, I do. - One thing, Audrey. Just one thing! Audrey, what about our demands? Who... Who is this? Stephanie? Is this you, Stephanie? Yes. Give us something. Now, listen, I want you to get what you want. I want you all to get what you want. It's all bullshit, isn't, Audrey? Now, Stephanie, listen to me. If Lester does anything foolish, if anything happens to Officer Jackson, it's murder. That means the rest of your life. That's not bullshit. Give us what we asked for. I lost her. I understand. Yes, sir. Right. The crowd's a problem, but we're trying to control them. Yes. - Thank you, sir. - We have the cell number. It's over. I want both teams to keep sweeping the building. We'll move in at 0500. You don't even know where they are. We'll find them. That's less than an hour. Commissioner wants this over before the morning news, so, uh, we'll take it from here. You've been relieved, Detective. - What? - You heard me. We can give them something. Negotiations are over. Hey, if this were Westchester, you'd wait for the millennium. Yeah, well, this isn't Westchester, Mr. Knowles. Okay, look, just give me the phone. Let me try him one more time, please. Thanks for your help, Mr. Knowles. What? Goodbye, Mr. Knowles. Didn't have to go this way. Yeah, well, it did. That shit is ill. That's beautiful. Damn. Hey, yo, little man, you live here, man? Yeah. I thought it'd be safe here. It's still safe. Nah, man. They gotta make examples out of us now. They gonna come in here and smoke all of us. God damn it, Rodney. But they don't know where we are. Yeah, for how long, huh? Huh? They shoot first, ask questions later... Look, stop it, Rodney. That's enough, all right? - Lester... - No, Stephanie. It's simple. You heard what I said on the phone. Anybody want to leave, there's the door. And proud dad is... Not so proud. That's too bad. Yeah. I mean, not that you're havin' a kid. There's lots of famous people that come from... Dumb sluts who get knocked up. You're not dumb. What are you gonna do? I was kind of hoping they'd nuke us and I wouldn't have to worry about it anymore. You think we should give up? Not yet. - Hey, what's up? - Get your hands off me. Yo, I say we take his ass to the roof, they don't give us what we want right now, motherfucker gonna fly. - Not now, all right? - No, now's the time, man. Look, I know it's not going to be easy, but think about your father, man. He ain't take shit from the cops. Shut up, all right, Rodney? You can't let them get away with that. Know what I'm saying? It's payback time. And if you bitch up after all of this, then you ain't shit. Pssh. Good thing he ain't livin' to see his son bendin' over... Shut the fuck up. No, that's all right. Shoot me. Yeah, shoot it, man. Don't push me, all right, Rodney? Yeah, 'cause you're feelin' me. I know you feelin' me. Time to start pointing that thing in the right direction. Ride or die. We're moving through the north corridor. There's only one floor left, Lieutenant. Nobody gotta die here. Not him. Not me. Nobody. But you, you're the only thing that's keeping that kid from going over the edge. Don't let Rodney's voice be the last voice he hears, okay? Medevacs are on the way. ETA, five minutes. All units stand by. We move in when we confirm their location. Lester, I don't know how much longer he's going to make it without a doctor. I'm not willing to let anyone die in here. Are you? If we don't get nothin', what did we do it for? I'll let Ziggy down, everybody. Just like my dad. They better give us something. Look, you stood up and you hyped up this whole city, and we followed you. Everybody knows who we are now. Whatever it is that you have to say about your father, they will listen now. Fuck they will. They will. Lester, tell me. Tell me what happened. We stopped at this all-night market, right? We'd just beat Rosemont by about 20 points. My dad was pumped. So he goes, "I wanna surprise you, champ. Wait right here." The cops roll up. They fly right when he's coming out with some Haagen-Dazs, and they say, "Assume the position!" "There's a robbery nearby and you fit the description." He looks at them, and he looks at me, and he says, "No." They say, "Assume the position!" Assume the position! And they pull their guns. My dad smiles and says, "Gentlemen, I'm not guilty of anything." "I've been at a game with my son." Next thing I know... He was on the ground, knee in his back, face on the concrete. I move to get out of the car, But the cop says, "Don't move, boy!" I try, I try to get out. I'm trying to get out... They shove me back, and I gave up. I look at my dad. He starts breathing all crazy and shit. He's reaching for his pocket. And I know what he's reaching for. The cops, they yell, "Gun!" "Gun!" And they shot him. They shot him. He had asthma, Stephanie. He was just reaching for his goddamn inhaler. I didn't do a thing. I just sat there... and I watched. The cops said it was an accident. I can't let him down again. Lester... What have you got for us, Audrey? Lester, it's me, Knowles. Knowles? Man, you... Who else is there? Nobody. I'm outside at a pay phone freezing my balls off. I stole the cell number from the police. This criminal shit must be contagious, man. Look, Lester, the cops, they figured out where you are and they're coming in. When? Any minute. Not even one of my demands. Now, Lester, listen to me. If you want to keep this thing alive, then you walk out now. We'll take this to court. I'll stand with you. A lot of us will. Lester, you have to end this now. Do you hear me? - I hear you. - Lester, now just get out of there. Yo, Knowles... thanks, man. Got 'em, Lieutenant. Fourth floor. East stairwell. Copy? Team two and three, proceed to east stairwell. Then full breach. Tell 'em we're on our way out, okay? Then you get going. I don't want you or anyone to get hurt. Us? What about you? - What you doing, man? We're in this together. - Get up. - No. - Lester. What do you expect me to do? - I gave them time. - Lester, don't do this. What did we ask for? Knowles to be rehired and some fucking books! - No, you're wrong! - Don't do this! They were never gonna give us anything. They lied like they always fucking do. Now get up! - Come on, Rodney, help me get him up. - Get the fuck up! - Don't do this! Stop! - No, Lester! This is payback! What are you doing? Go now! I gave them time! Everybody, get out of here now! Don't let anybody on the roof. Fasten your seatbelts, motherfuckers! Just walk! Just walk! Keep walking! Keep moving! Ow! Listen to me. Don't do this, son. No, you listen to me, okay? You know, when I was little, man, my dad used to walk me every day to the school door. And one day, he gave me his watch, his dad's watch. And you know what he said? Do you know what he said? - What? - He said, "Be on time." He said, "Pay attention." He said, "Always be a man", "so you don't end up being some punk. "A nobody!" We've got movement on the roof, sir. One's a hostage, one's got a gun. Copy? Look for the clean shot and take him out. Yes, sir. He didn't raise you to end up like this, man. I didn't want to be. I didn't have to be. But here I am. I'm as dead as he is. Keep moving. Shit! He blocked it. What's he doing? Get that helicopter in here. Shit. Move, goddamn it! Assume the position. What? I said assume the position. - No. - Look, I'm tired of talking! Assume the position! Your father said no, now I'm saying no. I messed up one kid's life, I'm not about to let you mess up yours. My father... My father didn't have to die. No. He didn't. But you think you can look me in the eyes and pull that trigger? They said, "Case closed." Fuck them! They didn't even say they were fucking sorry. He's gone, man. He's gone, and I'm sorry. I'm sorry you lost your father. I'm so sorry. - It's over. - But you gotta think about him. What about that night, remember? When he... When he looked at you, and he watched his only son playing ball, and he smiled. He was so proud of you. Check... Checkout time, slick. He's looking at you right now. What do you think he's thinking? Huh? Be a man. - No. - Lester! Police! Freeze! - Don't shoot, please! - Don't shoot! Give me a status report. Who was shot? I can't see anything, sir. Do you have a visual on the subject? No visual on the hostage. No visual on the HT. Un-fucking-believable! Where's the goddamn helicopter? It's okay. Everything's going to be all right. It's okay. It's okay. It's all right. It's over, all right? It's over. Rodney, no! I should have known you was gonna bitch up, man! New York City Police Department! Let him go, Rodney! - Put the gun down! - Damn it, Rodney, it's over! You ain't got the heart to do it, I will! Fuck that! Got a clear on the HT, sir. He's got the gun on Jackson. Get down on the ground now! Lester! - Put the gun down! - I'm gonna kill him right now! Lester! No! Stop! No! - Ziggy! - Green light. Lester! Zig! Somebody, help! Oh, God. Help. Somebody, fucking help! Come on, buddy. Come on, Zig, breathe. Come on, Ziggy, breathe. Breathe. Oh, shit, man. Get some help! Get some fucking help! Cold. No, you fight. You fight. Fight, Ziggy, fight. My boy, Les. I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry. No. For real. I stood up, man. Tell everybody. No. You're not gonna die. Promise. They're coming, Zig. They're coming, Zig. Just hold on. Just hold on. Promise me? I promise. I promise. Ziggy? Ziggy? Ziggy! Lester couldn't save me. No one could. But like I said, no one stood for anyone or anything until that day. We thought Jackson would testify against us. But he flipped the script and stood for us after all. Rodney went to the pen, and he ended up bendin' down and shit, but not like you think. I didn't believe it myself. Lynn did her bit, but she got bounced out because of her kid and all. She wrote to Stephanie for a while, told her she named her kid Zacharias. Then her letters stopped coming. No one ever heard from her again. The judge took one look at Rivers' act and made him join the army, figuring it would be crueler than usual punishment. But they were still sleepin' on my boy Rivers, 'cause let me tell you, it just put him in a higher tax bracket. Stephanie spent a year in jail. She's at St. John's now, pre-med. She wants to open a free clinic right here in Queens. Lester spent two years upstate. After he got out, he came back to Lincoln. Knowles had been rehired, and they left my place just like it was. He's at City College now, pre-law. And every year, Lester comes back, and he tells them how what we did and what happened to me... changed their lives too. My boy kept his promise after all. Knowles once said, "It's not how long you live," "but how you live and what you leave behind." Like the people who drew pictures on those caves 30,000 years ago or the lyrics Tupac laid down. Look, all I know for sure... is what you do while you're on this planet, yo, man, that's up to you.
