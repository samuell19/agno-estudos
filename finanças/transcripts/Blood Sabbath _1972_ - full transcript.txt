[MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC - CHUCK COWAN, "TITLE SONG"] [MUSIC PLAYING] [HOOTING] -Would you like a cold tea? -Oh, sure. Thank-- -Whoa! -Why you-- [HOOTING] -Bye bye. [MUSIC PLAYING] Bye bye! [MUSIC - CHUCK COWAN, "TITLE SONG"] [MUSIC PLAYING] [LAUGHTER] MAN: Hey man, we're outta beer. Let's go get some more out of the cabin. Come on. -Aww. -(WHISPERING) Hey, there's that kid again. -(WHISPERING) Shh. Let's have some fun. [GIGGLING] Sweet Jesus, ain't he something. DAVID: Ow! Hey! What is this? [GIGGLING] -Think he's got money on him. Come on. Come on, get his pants. Come on, get his pants. -Christ, get away from me! Goddammit! -Ooh! -Ow! [GROANING] -Wanda, don't let him go. Hey, there he goes. That way. -Hurry up. -Let's get him. WOMAN 1: Hey, there he is. WOMAN 2: Oh. You think he's dead? WOMAN 1: I don't know. Let's get the hell out of here. [GROAN] -Who are you? How'd I get here? Oh wait, please. Don't go. -Let me go. -Only if you promise to come back. -Please let me go. -Will you come back? Will you? -Yes. But I have to go now. -When? -Tomorrow. LONZO: Are you all right? -Mm. -Shh, shh, shh, shh. Never mind. Do not try to speak. Come, let me help you. [GRUNTING] What happened to you? -I don't know. -Where did you come from? -Come from? I come from-- Vietnam. -Morning, amigo. I found you near the lake. I found those clothes in the woods not far from here. I take it they must be yours. Oh, there was nothing else. Are you feeling any better? -Something very strange happened. -Mm. First we'll eat something, then I will take you and show you to the nearest village. -There was a girl. -Always. Always there's a girl in a man's dream. -No, no, no. This, this wasn't a dream. She was there. She was there and she-- she said that she'd come back to me. Which way is the lake? -No good comes of that lake-- except the fish I catch. Even they are getting hard to find. -Thank you. -Wait! Wait, don't go. -I've got to find the girl. I've-- -Dreams can wait, but empty stomachs must be filled. Please. Please. -You live here by yourself? -Yes, my name is Lonzo. What is yours? DAVID: David. DAVID (VOICEOVER): She said tomorrow. That was yesterday. Or was it? Vietnam-- was that yesterday too? Did I really see her or did I imagine it? No. No, dammit, I did see her, I know it. Gotta find her. Got to. [SIGH] -Well? Did you find your dream? 'Course you didn't. You'll never find her. You know why? Because she does not exist. This place was never meant to be your destination. This place means only loneliness. You should be moving on. -Oh no, I, I can't leave yet. Not yet. Lonzo, let me stay. Please. [SIGH] -All right. Go inside, get some rest. -You are real. -Do you think I am? -I want you to be. -Then I am. -I looked everywhere for you. [MUSIC PLAYING] My name's David. What's yours? -Yyala. -Yyala. Where are we going? -This is the place where I come when the spirits are angry with me-- and when I want to be by myself. -Uh, these, um, spirits-- are they mad at you now? [SIGH] -Yes. -Well, guess you want to be alone then. -No. -I don't want to be alone either. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I must-- I must go, David. -Oh no. No, wait, please. Stay with me a little while. I want to be with you. Yyala, I've never known before what it is to really want someone. -I want you too. But it can't be. I'm going to the lake. -Why are you here? What is it you want of me? -There is a boy. I saw him in the cave. -He is not of our village. -He is your friend. -Yes, he is my friend. So? So? -Bring him to me. -No. That is not part of our agreement. -I'm want him, Lonzo. -I will bring you a child, just as I have done each year. Nothing else. [CHUCKLING] I am not afraid of you, Alotta, nor of any of your treachery. Now get out! Out! -We shall see, Lonzo. We shall see. -I want her so much! I don't understand it. Lonzo, you know something about her. You've got to tell me. -There is a legend of a water nymph who lives in the cove. They say she is very dangerous and has mysterious powers, but it is only a legend. They say that, but they are an ignorant and superstitious people, unlike you. -But I've seen her. -Look, you are well now. I think it is time. It is best you are on your way, yes? -Yyala is real, damn you! -This is David. This candle is he. Flame burns as his spirit. Burns! This is his heart. Great is his love for me. Every wish he moves to fulfill. No rest shall he know until beside me he lies! -Don't come near or I'll go away and never return. Then if you don't care, I will go. -No, stay! Please. I want you to stay. -And why is it you want me to stay? -Because. [GIGGLING] Because I think I love you. -(LAUGHING) So you only think you love me. Well, I may come back after you've had enough time to think about it. -Yyala! I do love you. Do you love me? -Yes. More than I dare to. David, if I were to love you completely, I would die. -Yyala, I can't play these games anymore. I'm going out of my mind with you. -But what I say to you is true. You are of the land and I am of the sea. You have a soul and I do not. -You're really serious. -I may not love anyone who has a soul. -But I can't just be rid of my soul. Is that what you want me to do? -I tell you this so that you'll understand why-- why we can't be together and why you must go back to your own world. -Yyala, my world has no meaning for me without you. Don't you understand? I want you more than my world. -I'm sorry, David. I must go. -No, wait. Even if I wanted to get rid of my soul, I wouldn't-- I wouldn't know how. But you must know a way. -The danger is too great. -Then there is a way. What is it? Yyala, what is it? LONZO (VOICEOVER): This place was never meant to be your destination. DAVID (VOICEOVER): My world has no meaning without her. YYALA (VOICEOVER): You have a soul, David, and I do not. LONZO (VOICEOVER): I think it is time. It is best you were on your way. YYALA (VOICEOVER): I may not love anyone who has a soul. DAVID (VOICEOVER): But must be a way. YYALA (VOICEOVER): Go, David. The danger is too great. DAVID (VOICEOVER): No. No. -Don't ask me about souls. I don't know about souls. Fish, sheep-- but souls? -Well, who else can I ask? [MUSIC PLAYING] -Ah. Ah, that I can understand. Eh? [MUSIC PLAYING] That music. That music means my people have survived another year. Life is good, the land is-- the land is fruitful. -Yeah, life is good for you. I want it that way for me. -Here, you wear this and I wear this. You know, I haven't been in that village for a whole year. A whole year. How's my hair? [SNICKERING] -Good. -Ah, you wear this. Ah. High-spirited women, tequila, and music that'll stir the blood. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SINGING IN SPANISH] [CHEERING] [APPLAUSE] VILLAGER: [SPEAKING SPANISH] -Maria. Maria! Dos. -Mi corazon! -Oh, Dolores! Ahh. Hey, God's great gifts to man. Later. Oh, life is good. The whole year they struggle, hoping, trusting in the harvest. Again they have won. They celebrate their victory by sharing their good fortune with the gods. They welcome us to their wine, their women, their songs-- and their dances. This is your custom, is it not? -Yes. -He knows it too. After this is over, he will forgive them. They will confess and he'll forgive them. -[SINGING IN SPANISH] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Come along. Go home. Go home, sleep. Go. -I'm sorry, Padre. -No, it's all right. I see you've come for your yearly visit. -Am I not welcome? -The villagers say you are. -And you? -Will you be going to the mountain again this year? -I will go. -And another child will be sacrificed? -Before I brought a child to the mountain, there was no harvest. -It is God who provides the harvest, not the witches. You cannot pay homage to both. -Tell that to the people who go to your church. -But a child-- an innocent child! [GUNFIRE] [MUSIC PLAYING] -Please, you're making me feel like a funeral. Funeral? This is a party. Here-- have a real drink now, huh? Feels good. Everybody needs it. Eh? [COUGHING] [CHUCKLING] Hey, Dolores! Come here. Come here, baby. Good. Hey, Maria. -Oh. Hey, Lonzo, uh-- thank you very much, but I-- no-- [LAUGHTER] Mm! Mm! No! [MUSIC PLAYING] I'm sorry about that girl, Padre. I don't seem to know what I'm doing anymore. -Are you troubled, my son? You like to talk about it? -Padre, you know all about souls, don't you? I mean, how to s-save them and all that. -Yes. -Do you know how somebody would go about losing his soul? -(CHUCKLING) Has the tequila gone to your head? -No, I want to be rid of mine. -Are you serious? -Dead serious. Padre, please, you've got to tell me how to do it. -What is happening in my village? Am I not supposed to hear? Not supposed to see or feel? You're asking me to help you get rid of your soul? No! Dammit, I say no! Go! Eat! Drink! Go have your harvest! Damn you, all of you! I say no more! No more! Go! Go! [VILLAGERS MURMURING] [COYOTE HOWLING] [WOMAN MOANING] Oh my god. My child, what have they done to you? -Oh, help me, Padre, please. Alotta, she plans to-- ALOTTA: Gemma? You honor us with your presence, my friend. -Release that girl, damn you! -Oh, Gemma. She's merely being punished for some disobedience and lying. Really, my friend. Thirsty, no doubt. Bring the wine and, and release the prisoner in honor of the padre's visit. -Do not think that you can trick me or fool me. -Now why would I want to do that? You kept your part of the bargain. You haven't interfered. And I've kept mine. Friendship and peace which benefits all. Come, my friend. You're tired. Her name is Nadia. I don't think you've seen her before. She's yours if you like. -I came here for other reasons. -Oh? All things in good time. Which one, Padre? Which one will it be? The most secret. Is your blood on fire? This one. This one, Padre, is Karma. You've known Karma before-- the memory of which excites you yet. -Prisoner! Where is she? -How suspicious you are this night. As you can see, Padre, the prisoner's been released. She's yours to command. Well, go to him, Gemma. He is your benefactor. -No, no, no. No, my child. Come, sit down. Do not be frightened. Come, you are safe here. Sit. Here, drink this. [LAUGHTER] Oh. Shh, shh, shh, shh, shh. ALOTTA: Ah, she likes you, Padre. Enjoy her at your pleasure. [GIGGLING] [CACKLING] -No! No! I remember why I came here. I must warn you, Alotta. -Warn me? -All this must stop. No more children, no more souls. -You speak for all the villagers? -Yes. I speak for them, finally, as their priest. I also speak for my god. -Oh. So all of this must stop, hm? And what of your own pleasures? Hm? -This too is in the past. I will come here no longer. -No! Padre, no. If you go, they'll sacrifice me. -What? Are you resuming the blood sacrifice? -None of your concern. -You think me an old and foolish man, don't you? Perhaps I am, but I will stop you. I will destroy you and your cult! I swear by my god, I will. I will destroy you and your cult. -What will become of us now? -Enough! Samara-- Samara, bring me his likeness. How dare he threaten the power of your queen. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GIGGLING] [LAUGHTER] His fate is sealed. [CROW CAWING] -A signal. Oh my god. It is time. They're here. What if I don't go? No, then Alotta-- she would take revenge on the villagers. No. No, no, no, I must go, I must. Come here, little one. [SOBBING] -(SOBBING) Not-- no-- DAVID: Lonzo! -Hmm? -What the hell is going on here? What are you doing with this child? -This is none of your business. -Where are you taking her? -You would not understand. This has nothing to do with you. -Where are you taking this child, Lonzo? -Look, this is something that has been going on for many, many years. -What has? -An agreement. An agreement with the witches. Each year, a child must be delivered. -You mean sacrificed. -She will not die. No harm will come to her. -What will they do with her then? -They will take her soul and, after a while, she will become one of them. -And then? Lonzo, wait-- you don't have to take them the child. There's another way. -Hmm? -They want a soul, right? -Right. -I don't want mine. Don't you see? Lonzo, it's the only way I can be with Yyala. -No, David, you can't. -Lonzo, you've got to help me, please. Please help me. LONZO (VOICEOVER): The queen of the witches is called Alotta. She is very powerful and treacherous. She is served by a coven of witches who are totally in her power-- the children of the villagers, now grown up. She will try to trick you, David, so be careful or you may yet lose both your soul and Yyala. [CACKLING] [CACKLING] [CACKLING] [CACKLING] [CACKLING] -Hello? [CACKLING] Are you Alotta? [MUSIC PLAYING] [CACKLING] I want Alotta! Alotta! [MUSIC PLAYING] Looking for Alotta! Alotta! Alotta! If I don't return, Lonzo won't bring you the child! [MUSIC PLAYING] -You dare to threaten me? DAVID: Wait! Lonzo won't bring the child. -And how does that concern you? -I sent them back. -If that's true, the villagers will pay very heavily. And so will you. -Alotta, you want a soul. -Mhm. -I've got one for you. -You? And whose will you bring me? -Mine. -Yours? You offer yours in place of the child? -You take the souls of children. Why not take mine? -Ah, in return for which you want, um-- let me see. D-d-don't tell me. Yyala! -I love Yyala. -And you can't have her, can you? Until you get rid of your soul. Mm. Did Yyala send you here to plead? -No, and I'm not pleading with you. I'm offering you a trade. -Yyala is inconstant and short-loving. She will leave you and you will have no soul and you will have no love. -No. No, sh-she won't. She won't leave me. -Ah yes, but if-- if she does, do you promise to return here to me? Hm? Come. Come. Come with me, while I consider it. [MUSIC PLAYING] You understand the terms? -Just get it over with. -Afterwards, you can never return to your world, your people. -I don't care about that. All I want is Yyala. -Oh. And if Yyala leaves you, you must return here to be with me. Agreed? Agreed? -Yes! Take my soul, damn you! [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAMING] -Flame burn as his spirit burns. [SCREAMING] [SOBBING] My every wish he moves to fulfill. -Oh my god! [SCREAMING] ALOTTA: On the eve of the next full moon, he will return here on the Blood Sabbath. [MUSIC PLAYING] -I'm free! I'm free! I'm free! You can love me now. Free! Yyala! You can love me, Yyala. Nothing stands between us. Yyala! I'm free, Yyala! [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SQUEAL] [LAUGHTER] Ahh. Ohh. ALOTTA (VOICEOVER): Remember, David-- on the eve of the next full moon. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] ALOTTA: David, come here. [MUSIC PLAYING] [SCREAM] -Yyala. -Oh! David-- Ah! No! No! Ah! [MUSIC PLAYING] [MUSIC PLAYING] Lonzo. Lonzo! -Yyala? -Lonzo, David-- he came into the cave with, with blood all over him. Sacrificial blood. -Well, what did you expect? -I don't know. Not this. Not this change in him. -I tried to keep them away from you, from the lake, but he was obsessed. -And I tried to stay away from him too. -You didn't try hard enough. -I couldn't help myself, Lonzo. I was drawn to him. -You were just indulging yourself at his expense. -I warned him of the barrier between us and that he should leave. -You told him of the barrier so he could find a way to break it. -I didn't know it would come to this. -You didn't want to know. You didn't care. You were only amusing yourself. -No, Lonzo, I love him. I truly love him. -Then leave him. Let him go, so he can get out from under the evil influence of Alotta. Let him go, Yyala, before it is too late. -She's left you, David. I told you she would. -No, she didn't leave me. I'll find her. -I've seen her. -You know where she is? Tell me! Alotta, please, you must tell me where she is. [LAUGHTER] Where is she? -Do something for me and I'll tell you where she is. -Anything. -Anything? -Anything. [LAUGHTER] -That's your task. Bring me his head on a platter and I'll give you Yyala. -I can't. I can't do it. [LAUGHTER] -Not even for Yyala? [CHUCKLING] -David? David? [GIGGLING] -No, not this-- no, get away from me. David! [CACKLING] Stop it! Leave me alone, please! David! No! David! -You've lost him, Yyala. -What have you done to him? -Oh, David gave his soul for you. He's drunk the blood of our sacrifice. Soon, he'll be one of us. -No. No, I won't let that happen. -Oh? And how do you propose to stop it? -I'll fight you, Alotta. I'll fight you with everything I have. -I control David now. He will do my bidding, exactly what I want. Only in death can David be free of me. Even now, as we talk, he is sealing his own fate. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Murderer. Murderer! -No! -Murderer! -I'm no murderer. -Murderer. -Yyala did it. I tell you, Yyala did it. She did it because of David. -You lie. Where are they? What have you done to them? -It's them. They're together. -No. No, it is you who have done this. -Yyala. It's Yyala's fault. -Yyala! -Yyala. You came back. -Yes. -You don't have to be afraid of me. -I'm not-- anymore. Mm. -Don't ever leave me. -I won't. -You might, when you find out what I've done. -Whatever it is, it isn't your fault-- not really. -So many things have happened I, I don't understand. -Not now, David. Not now, my love. Here, drink this. -Run, Yyala! [SCREAM] [GROAN] -(DISTRAUGHT) Lonzo. -Oh god. [SOBBING] -It's going to be all right, David. -He tried to kill me. -He was after me, and he was right. I'm to blame. I'm to blame for everything. Forgive me. Forgive me, David. [MUSIC PLAYING] -Yyala, I love you. [SOBBING] [BELL RINGING] ALOTTA (VOICEOVER): If Yyala leaves you, David, you must return here, to me. -I kept my part of the bargain. Why couldn't you keep yours? Why? Samara? Why are you all hiding from me? DAVID: Lonzo is dead. -And what of Yyala? -Gone. -Oh. Oh, David. So Yyala's gone and you've come back to me as agreed. Come. [MUSIC PLAYING] [GASP] Oh, damn you! Oh, you're not rid of me yet, David. I lay on you my last curse-- dying curse. I call forth your own people to kill you! [MUSIC PLAYING] ALOTTA (VOICEOVER): I call forth your own people to come and kill you! [EXPLOSIONS] -Elephant Spotter Two to Forward Air Control. Repeat, Elephant Spotter Two to Forward Air Control.
